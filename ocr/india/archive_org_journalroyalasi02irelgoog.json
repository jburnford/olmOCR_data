A writer, who had been deeply impressed by his first view of the site of the city, thus describes the scene:\u2014\"Far as the eye can reach for ten square miles there is nothing between heaven and earth but boulders; the earth is paved with them, the sky is pierced with them, and their granite particles glitter and scintillate in the morning sun . . . . literally in thousands of all sizes, . . . . heaps upon heaps, in one instance 250 feet in height.\"\n\nMy personal belief is that in former years this whole tract was covered with forest, though now in most places so barren, and that the ancient tribes who dwelt therein had the cool and comfortable shade of trees over their heads, as well as ready-made dwellings to live in amongst the crags and huge broken masses of gneiss and granite. Everywhere are found neolithic celts and implements\u2014polished axe-heads, hammers, mealing-stones, bone-crushers, with some few flint or agate flakes and cores; and on the rocks of the Peacock Hills, a range about four miles east of Bellary, there are in the sides of several boulders many hollows scooped, in which the old workers had polished their weapons. The gneiss is here crossed by an enormous dyke of trap rock, and the armourers of those days had selected the spot for one of their principal workshops.\n\nIn the plains close to the foot of the hills are two very curious and large cinder-mounds; and it is to these cinder-mounds, and to others similar to them found in other places in the neighbourhood, that I am anxious to call attention in the present paper.\n\nI have purposely prefaced my observations with a slight description, which connects the dwelling-places of neolithic man with the principal city of the great Vijayanagar kingdom, for the reason that, while general opinion hitherto has held all the cinder-mounds to be the work of the prehistoric races of Southern India, I hold myself that there is fair ground for supposing that some may be, after all, of no very great antiquity, and that their origin can be plausibly explained otherwise.\nthe specimens submitted to him to be \"nodular and tufaceous carbonate of lime, more or less calcined and semi-vitrified, which, probably from having been long exposed to the atmosphere, have imbibed again some carbonic acid.\"\n\nThe B\u00fcdigunta mound is described by Mr. Newbold as dome-shaped, 46 feet in height and 420 feet in circumference, entirely formed of scorious ashes.\n\n\"Towards the summit they are whitish and friable, and appear to have been crushed, but nearer the base are seen larger masses . . . shining, semi-vitrified. The internal structure of the more calcined portions is highly vesicular, not homogeneous, but imbedding in its cavities whitish friable ashes and hard dark-green or black cellular cinders.\" Mr. Newbold found in the B\u00fcdigunta mound a piece of hornblende rock which appeared to him to have been fashioned by human agency\u2014\"probably a portion of some ancient vessel.\"\n\nOne of the Peacock Hill mounds, that nearest to the rocks, is described very accurately by Newbold. It is about 15 feet in height, having a tabular but somewhat concave summit, which is \"girt in by a low rugged wall, composed of semi-vitrified blocks of scorious ashes loosely piled together. Its longest diameter is 93 feet. Fragments of rude pottery were found on the surface.\" The explorer made excavations in the mound. He found that the upper portion, to the depth of $4\\frac{1}{2}$ feet, consisted of ashy-grey earth and ashes, with horizontal bands of a darker colour and of a soft chalky texture, \"portions of which were slightly unctuous to the touch.\" Below this lay a bed of scorious ashes, partly vitrified and about 5 feet thick. Then a foot of ashes similar to the former mixed with fragments which resembled charcoal. Underneath was a bed $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet thick of a dark earth, and below this a bed 3 feet thick of gravel, the detritus of the main rock on which it rested. This last affords positive proof that the remains are not of volcanic origin.\n\n\"All the ashy earths,\" says Lieut. Newbold, \"and most of the less vitrified fragments of the scorious ashes, effervesce\nwhole, however, the human ashes are of a lighter and less vitreous character, arising evidently from the less degree and continuance of heat to which they were exposed, and from the circumstance of the bodies at the present day being generally burnt singly on separate pyres . . . . The greater weight, density, and higher state of vitrification of the scoriaceous ashes of the mounds may be accounted for by the greater intensity of heat under pressure to which they were subject. For if we are disposed to admit that there are gleanings of truth in the tradition of the Hindus, that these ashes are really animal remains, or if, after a more minute analysis than I have the means of rendering, they prove to be what they certainly most resemble, it is apparent from the density exhibited in the section of the mound opened, the large size of the masses of the scoriae, and their state of vitrification, that they must have been the result of one, or perhaps two, enormous and long-continued fires. It is quite certain that they cannot be the ashes of individual funeral pyres collected into heaps . . . . and it may be added that the mounds are almost always found in sequestered spots at a distance from any town.\u201d\n\nThe writer then points out that though in the case of both calcined human remains and of burnt limestone there exists free lime which, having attracted carbonic acid from atmospheric exposure, would effervesce slightly when treated with acids, a state of things observed during the examination of the contents of these ancient mounds, a careful analysis of the scoriae by a gentleman in Manchester resulted in the discovery of phosphoric acid with lime in them\u2014\u201ca fact which leaves but little doubt of their animal origin.\u201d\n\nSuch was Lieut. Newbold\u2019s decided opinion in the year 1843. Fifty-five years later, viz. in the current year, I handed over some specimens obtained from these same mounds, and brought by myself to England, to Mr. W. W. Watts, of the Geological Society, at the Museum in Jermyn Street, London, asking him whether modern examination\nwould confirm or disprove the notion that the mounds were the remains of enormous pyres, on which in fierce heat were consumed the bodies of either human beings or animals.\\(^1\\) Mr. Watts has kindly given me the following written opinion:\n\n\u201cThese specimens are certainly not volcanic slags, nor are they derived from any process of ore-smelting. They do not appear, either, to be such slags as result from lime-burning, glass- or brick-making.\n\n\u201cThe large specimen from Nimbaipuram consists of a glassy slag, which has caught up while melted numerous bits of grit of various sorts, chiefly felspar and quartz. As Lieut. Newbold points out, this is the surface dust resulting from decomposition of the rocks on which the mounds are situated. Fragments of bone are to be seen in this slag.\n\n\u201cThe smaller specimen from Budigunta consists of a mixture of slag with ashy matter which is probably the result of burning fuel. The light-coloured slag is deeply coloured at contact with the dark ash. The microscopic aspect of the slag is similar to that of the larger specimen, but the cavities contain, in greater abundance, numerous minute bundles of crystals, almost certainly carbonate of lime, which have been deposited in them since the slag cooled down. These account for the effervescence of the slag with acid, and have been produced by the action of carbonic acid on the lime salts in the slag.\n\n\u201cThe specimens from the Peacock Hills near Bellary seem to be practically the same as in the Budigunta specimen. The dark colour of the ash disappears in heating, and is evidently the relic of the carbonaceous matter of the fuel still left in the ash.\n\n\u201cMr. E. T. Newton has examined the bones in this box, and finds that while one specimen is undoubtedly human, two are certainly not human, and the rest are indeterminable.\u201d\n\n\\(^1\\) One of my specimens was from Budigunta, the larger from Nimbaipuram.\nWe may then assume with a fair amount of certainty that these great mounds are the remains of enormous pyres on which were burnt the bodies of animals or human beings, or both.\n\nBut why? And when? Let us consider the latter first. I do not think it necessary to assume that the remains must belong to the prehistoric races. They seem to indicate the destruction by burning of animal substances, possibly bodies of human beings, alive or dead. Mr. Newbold pointed out two ways in which the ancient races may have caused these mounds. First, there is mention in a Hindu work, the Parasu R\u0101ma Vijaya, of women consuming themselves en masse on the same pyre with the bodies of their husbands slain in battle; and in an old Tamil record the women of a whole aboriginal tribe are represented as causing a great pile of fire to be kindled, into which they leaped, and died execrating their enemies, the Hindus, who, by treachery, had succeeded in slaughtering every male of their clan. Secondly, what more probable, he says, than that the mounds are made of the ashes of the slain, burnt collectively after some battle\u2014monuments perhaps of the bloody struggles that took place between the early Brahmanical settlers and the savage aborigines?\n\nOr they might, he thinks, even be, as held by the Hindus themselves, the remains of great sacrificial holocausts performed by the Rishis of old, since the annals of the country abound in allusions to both bestial and human sacrifices on a fearful scale of magnitude, made for the attainment of supernatural power, for the discovery of hidden treasure, in propitiation of malign spirits, or to deities presiding over agriculture and commerce.\n\nBut must we go so far back in history? Surely the fact that they are found in a country where most undoubtedly the races that used neolithic weapons resided, need not be accepted as conclusively establishing that the neolithic races were the creators of these mounds. For neolithic remains are found all over the district, and the discovery of a celt here and there amongst the d\u00e9bris would not\nsufficiently support such a theory. I think it suffices to come down to much more modern times, and though the notion of vast human and animal sacrifices carried out by the ancient races may possess a charm to the antiquarian mind we must be careful to guard against a too hasty acceptance of it.\n\nI ask, then, is it or is it not possible that these mounds may be only from three to five hundred years old? If so, they may have been caused in one or other of the following ways:\n\nFor the first. This country was the scene of fearful carnage and wholesale massacres during the wars between the Muhammadan kings of the Dakhan and the Hindu kings of Vijayanagar. There were bloody battles in the plains and vengeful slaughters of citizens after the capture of fortresses. At Adoni, forty miles north-north-east of the Peacock Hills, Muhammad Shah Bahmani, at the sack of that town, slew 70,000 Hindus. Outside Vijayanagar the Muhammadan confederation massacred all the inhabitants in the suburbs, and after the fall of the great city their excesses knew no bounds. Is it not possible that on the sites where so many thousands of dead lay in the burning sun the Muhammadan commanders may have collected the remains and consumed them in vast pyres to prevent pestilence amongst their troops? The situations of the mounds certainly do not militate against this theory\u2014rather the reverse. Witness the mound at B\u00fcdigunta, on the ridge of the pass described above, the very place where terrific hand-to-hand fighting may be conceived to have taken place in the attack and defence of one of the principal approaches to the Hindu capital.\n\nOr if this is too commonplace an explanation, I will offer one more romantic, which might at least account for the enormous mound amongst the rocky hills at Nimbapur on the river outside Vijayanagar. The Hindu dynasty that ruled, at that place, over all Southern India for two centuries was founded about the year 1336 A.D. In 1442 the capital was visited by 'Abdur Razz\u0101k, ambassador from\nPersia, and we have in his *Matla'us-Sa'dain*\u00b9 a glowing description of the magnificence of the sovereign, amongst whose cherished possessions was a seraglio of 700 ladies\u2014princesses and others.\n\nAbout the same time, or perhaps a little earlier, Nicolo Conti, an Italian traveller, went to Vijayanagar, and from his rather short account of the place I extract the following passage\u00b2:\u2014\"The inhabitants of this region marry as many wives as they please, who are burnt with their dead husbands. Their king is more powerful than all the other kings of India. He takes to himself twelve thousand wives, of whom four thousand follow him on foot wherever he may go, and are employed solely in the service of the kitchen. A like number, more handsomely equipped, ride on horseback. The remainder are carried by men in litters, of whom two thousand or three thousand are selected as his wives on condition that at his death they should voluntarily burn themselves with him, which is considered to be a great honour for them.\"\n\nIn A.D. 1514 Duarte Barbosa visited Vijayanagar,\u00b3 and he notes this custom of *sati*, stating that the women of the city were burnt with their deceased husbands \"in an open space outside the city, where there is a great fire.\" This description entirely coincides with the situation of the Nimbarpur mound. He goes on to say:\u2014\"When the king dies four or five hundred women burn themselves with him in the same manner, and they throw themselves suddenly into the pit and fire where they burn the body of the king; for the pit and fire are very large, and a great quantity can be burned in it . . . . and many men, confidants of the king, burn themselves with him.\"\n\nThe next authority is the traveller Caesar Frederic,\u2074 who, relating his adventures at Vijayanagar in 1567 A.D., describes the ceremonies attendant on a widow becoming\n\n\u00b9 *Matla'us-Sa'dain* (Sir Henry Elliot's History of India, vol. iv, pp. 95\u2013126).\n\u00b2 Hakluyt edition, vol. xxii.\n\u00b3 Hakluyt edition, vol. xxxiv, p. 93.\n\u2074 Id., vol. ii, p. 347.\nsati on her husband's death, and the processions about the streets, and then writes (I discard the old form of spelling):\u2014\"Then they go out of the city, and going along the river's side called Nigondin, which runneth under the walls of the city, until they come unto a place where they use to make this burning of women . . . . and when there dieth any great man his wife with all his [female] slaves . . . . burn themselves together with him.\"\n\nHere, again, the description aptly coincides with the situation of the Nimb\u0101pur cinder-mound. So that it may, after all, be merely the funeral pyre where for two centuries successive holocausts of large numbers of living women took place, hundreds being burnt at one time at the death of every sovereign, while large numbers were similarly destroyed day by day\u2014the wives of citizens, chiefs, and princes, residents in this very extensive and populous city.\n\nI offer this suggestion as a not unreasonable explanation of what must otherwise seemingly remain inexplicable.\n\nIn opposition to this theory must be specially noted the annular shape of one of the Peacock Hill mounds. In this one case it is certainly difficult to conceive that it could have been caused in the manner suggested; and the problem as to its origin must be considered as yet unsolved. Mr. Hubert Knox, of the Civil Service, who made a very careful examination of it, has kindly favoured me with his original notes, as well as with a letter written to him on the subject by Mr. R. Bruce Foote, of the Geological Survey of India. Mr. Foote knew the place well, and his opinion is therefore of much value. Both these gentlemen believe the mound to be prehistoric, and to have been made by the tribes to whom must be credited the stores of neolithic axe-heads, crushers, and other implements found in abundance amongst the boulders on the hill above. Parallel with the axis of the hill runs a large trap dyke, and it is of this hard and durable material that the weapons were made. This dyke, indeed, is almost certainly the cause of there having been a settlement here of the tribes\nthat lived in neolithic days, a settlement of the existence of which there is abundant evidence. Commanding an extensive view over the surrounding country, raised above the main forest below, and therefore exposed to pleasant breezes, this range of hills, with its ample store of material for the manufacture of weapons and implements of all sorts, its broken masses of cliffs and boulders, amongst which the inhabitants could always find shade when the day was hot, and protection when the weather was inclement, would form an ideal habitation for the tribes of those days. And that it did so is plain. For not only are there found amongst the crevices remains of neolithic stone implements in abundance, but on the rock faces themselves are the hollows made by the manufacturers in the act of polishing, while on the boulders above are a number of graffiti, many of which are beyond doubt of great antiquity.\\(^1\\)\n\nI shall not attempt to discuss the latter in the present paper, but merely note in passing that the presence, amongst the representations here given, of animals most commonly found amongst forests has tended to strengthen my belief that in former days the jungle covered this country to a far greater extent than is now the case. The animals to which I allude are elephants, bears, monkeys, deer or elk with branching horns, and peafowl.\n\nIn the plain close under this hill to the east are two large cinder-mounds. One is solid and lofty, and may have been formed in the manner I have ventured to suggest. The other, however, is different. It consists of a circular ring formed by a mound about five feet high, with the centre of the ring scarcely raised above the level of the plain surrounding it. The ring measures about thirty yards across its diameter. Mr. Knox notes that he and Mr. Fawcett cut a trench across the enclosed space. \"We found that the whole of the inside consists of ashes which\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. F. Fawcett read a paper about these before the Ninth Congress of Orientalists in London.\nlay on the earth about the level of the field outside. Our trench was carried up to the hard bank which encloses the mound. This bank had a nearly perpendicular section inside, and a sloping section outside . . . . specimens of the cinders were submitted to Mr. R. B. Foote . . . . we found bones and pottery among the ashes, but not a single worked stone. Mr. Fawcett took the bones which seem determinable to England. They have been identified as chiefly those of rodents.\"\n\nThis last statement must certainly be traversed by an inspection of some of the bones now shown, which are too large to have belonged to any known rodent; while I am fortified by the opinion of experts in the Geological Museum in Jermyn Street. Mr. E. T. Newton, as already stated, declared one of the bones to be certainly human. Possibly for \"rodent\" we should read \"ruminant.\"\n\nMr. Bruce Foote's opinion on the specimens is important. He writes, under date August 1, 1891\u2014\"I have examined the contents of the box carefully. The specimens without exception are slag or ash\u2014not a trace of tufa. The ash shows in many cases traces of vegetable matter in a rather comminuted state, such as you see it in buffalo's dung. Some of the ash is still full of carbonaceous matter, evidently from imperfect combustion. I am more than ever inclined to think the wider heaps due to the combustion of great heaps of cattle manure and straw.\" He then refers to a custom he had heard of as existing in South Africa, where some tribes pile up their cattle manure in banks inside their thorn zaribas. \"Such accumulations of manure when dry would have been very liable to take fire, and would have smouldered away slowly if very tightly pressed down, or burned fast where loosely packed. When clayey sand or felspathic sand was mixed with the dung, and the heat fierce enough, it would inevitably form a slaggy cinder, but where pure the soft ash would be produced . . . . One bone must have been scraped with a moderately sharp implement, and looks as if it were to have been carved into some definite object . . . . The total absence of stone\nimplements in the excavated part is a puzzling fact, for I certainly found celts, mealing-stones, and corn-crushers, in some quantity, in the Sanavasapur camp, together with pottery in considerable variety.\u201d One piece of pottery was found in this Kapgal (Peacock Hill) circle, and is now exhibited.\n\nMr. Foote sums up his views on the several mounds in the Bellary district thus:\u2014\u201cThe zariba cattle-manure theory will only hold good for such cinder-mounds as are really camps. Some of the others, such as Budikanama, Nimbaipur, and Sugur, appear to have been really funeral pyres. Gadiganur, Kanchagar-Bellagal, and the Kapgal mounds I am doubtful about; but Sanavasapur, Lingadihalli, and Halakandi I incline to regard as genuine zariba camps. The smaller cinder-mounds at Sangankal, Kuriguppa, and K\u00e2kaballa I regard as great feasting-places; the number of mealing-stones, corn-crushers, and pounders they shewed, together with the lot of bones chiefly of oxen, makes this idea quite probable.\u201d\n\nAccording to this authority, therefore, the Bellary cinder-mounds would be divided into three classes, excluding three of them which are doubtful.\n\n1. Large feasting-places, three.\n2. Gigantic funeral pyres, three.\n3. Zariba camps, three.\n\nWith regard to No. 2, Mr. Foote\u2019s opinion is in accord with mine.\n\nAs to No. 3, I regret that I do not know their size. The Kapgal mound is classed by Mr. Foote as \u201cdoubtful,\u201d and it certainly seems to me impossible for a zariba camp to be so extremely small in area\u2014only thirty yards, ninety feet, across. In a true zariba the defenders must have room to wield their weapons\u2014to hurl their spears, to whirl their slings\u2014and if we allow a space of only ten feet all round the inner circumference for this purpose, we are reduced to a circle of seventy feet diameter for all the cattle, women\nand children, old men, and non-combatants: this would seem to be far too small for the purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, then, and to sum up, the situation, so far as I am personally concerned, is as follows. We have a large number of cinder-mounds in the Bellary district. Some of them are probably of the neolithic age. Are they all so?\n\nA. Three appear to have been enormous funeral pyres. I suggest that these may possibly owe their origin to incineration of living human beings, dead soldiers, and animals slaughtered in battle, possibly of so recent a date as the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries A.D.\n\nB. The rest may be of neolithic age, but some may perhaps be more modern. Of these we have Mr. Bruce Foote's classification.\n\n(a) Large feasting-places (three). I confess to a doubt as to whether they may not be smaller examples of Class A. One of the Kapgal mounds, viz. that which is solid and lofty, I have seen, and think its shape and size incompatible with the idea of its being the remains of anything connected with mere feasting.\n\n(b) Zariba camps (three). I have not seen any of those mentioned and can form no opinion. But unless they are much larger than the annular Kapgal mound I cannot subscribe to the theory.\n\n(c) Doubtful (three). Amongst these Mr. Foote places the annular Kapgal mound.\n\nThe origin of this last remains at present, to my mind, an unsolved problem.\nAdditional Notes.\n\n(p. 9) That the dead were sometimes collected and burned after battles, can be proved by contemporary Portuguese chronicles.\n\n(pp. 10, 11) Purchas, about 1616, confirms these accounts of wholesale burning of numbers of women, and, like Caesar Frederic, describes them as \"passing by the river's side to the burning-place,\" a description which tallies with the situation of the Nimbaipur mound.\n\n(p. 11) Mr. Knox has written to say that he now accepts the author's views.\n\nTo account for the present small size of some of the pyres, in face of the suggestion that they may have originated in the burning of thousands of dead bodies after a battle, I offer the following explanation:\u2014The agriculturists of the neighbourhood would use the remains for manuring their fields. Year by year the heaps would grow less and less, the ryots digging into them from the outside, while the wind blew the ashes and lighter materials from the surface. But year by year also the untouched centre would become more and more indurated. The nett result would be the perpetual exposure of a hardened core, left in position because it was valueless, and growing harder by exposure and pressure. The greater size of the mass at Nimbaipuram may be explained by the fact that it lies in a narrow valley between rocky hills, with a very limited amount of cultivation surrounding it.\n\nLastly, I would mention that the topographical position of the known cinder-mounds lends colour to the theory that they may be the remains of extensive incinerations of bodies of men slain in battle; since, while neolithic remains of the ancient races are met with all over the district, these mounds are only met with on the direct approaches to the great Hindu capital at Vijayanagar\u2014the main lines of attack.\nART.

Wenrich refers to three copies of a Latin version at Paris.\u00b9 There is nothing to show that this MS. is a translation from the Greek. On the contrary, it has every appearance of being an original work. While positive evidence as to its authorship is wanting, the ascription to Fakhru'ddin R\u0101zi is at least probable. The style is archaic, and quite in harmony with other works of the period. Some Arabic constructions occur, e.g., \u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u062f\u0646 \u0646\u0631\u0645.

Ibn Mandavaih is placed by W\u00fcstenfeld in the middle of the fifth century of the Hijra. Muhammad Zakariyy\u0101 seems to be the famous Rhazes (Ab\u016b Bekr Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Zakariyy\u0101 al-R\u0101z\u012b), who died in 311 A.H. or 320 A.H.

If we leave him out of account, Ibn Mandavaih, who flourished more than a hundred years before Fakhru\u2019dd\u012bn R\u0101zi, is the latest authority mentioned.\n\nThis MS. contains a number of words which I have not found in the dictionaries:\n\n(9. 3).

There are two sorts: (a) water which falls from the air, (b) water which proceeds from the earth. (a) is superior to (b), (1) because it is free from contamination, (2) because the falling raindrops move rapidly, and motion is a cause of heat, and heat is a cause of purity.\n\nP. 14. why rain in winter is better and purer than rain in summer. Four reasons.\n\nP. 16. why rain accompanied with thunder and lightning is purer.\n\nwhy rain-water, though it is purer than any other, quickly becomes putrid.\n\n(b) Water which proceeds from the earth: (1) running water, (2) standing water. Running water proceeds (a) from fountains, (b) from melted snow or ice. Six reasons why (a) is superior to (b). There are three kinds of standing water: (a) well-water, (b) water bubbling up from the ground (\u0632\u0647 \u0622\u0628), (c) water in woods or reedy places.\n\nP. 24. (Section 5, on drinking water in large quantities). Three great evils arise from water-drinking.\n\nP. 27. (Section 6, on the evil effects of cold water). It is not allowed in six cases: (a) when fasting, (b) immediately after eating, for four reasons, (c) after sexual intercourse or violent exercise, (d) when one is thirsty at night, unless the thirst is caused by drinking wine to excess or eating bitter and peppery food, (e) after hot food, (f) when one is wet or hot.\n\n1 Section 3 is omitted in the MS.\nP. 33. (Section 7, on waters cooled by ice and snow).\n\nP. 39. (Section 8, on waters which have suffered change). These are three kinds: (a) water heated by fire. (b) water heated by the sun in pools.

(Section 1, on the advantages of wine). Though wine is forbidden by law, the physician must be acquainted with its good and bad properties. Two benefits are derived from drinking it, (a) it purifies the spirit, (b) it strengthens the body.\n\nP. 49. (Section 2, explaining why the wine of the grape is superior to all other beverages). Four reasons are given.\n\nP. 54. (Section 3, explaining the evil effects of wine).\n\nP. 54. (Section 4, explaining what persons have constitutions suited to wine).\nP. 55.

(Section 7, on the symptoms which show themselves in a drunken man). The author propounds twenty questions (\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644), to which he gives answers:\n\n1. Why drinking wine produces drunkenness.\n\n2. Why, when a man is engaged in drinking, his high spirits increase, whereas he ends by making a row (\u0639\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u062f).\n\n3. Why a drunken man imagines that everything is turning round.\n\n4. Why a man squints in the last stage of drunkenness.\n\n5. Why, although the nature of wine is hot, drunken men are more sensitive to cold.\n\n6. Why habitual wine-drinkers have fewer children.\n\n7. Why those who drink their wine neat suffer less from dimness of sight and vertigo, while those who mix it with water are liable to these maladies.\n\n8. Why, seeing that cold is the cause of tremors, and wine is hot and moist, those who drink much wine suffer from tremors.\n\n9. Why, since the nature both of children and of young men is hot and corresponding to the nature of wine, children should not drink it, while young men should.\n(10) Why some men cannot have sexual intercourse when they are drunk.\n\n(11) Why some men, if they drink with small cups, get drunk quickly, whereas if they drink with large cups, they do not get drunk at all, while others again experience the contrary.\n\n(12) Why negroes (\u0632\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0627\u0646) desire more than other men to drink wine.\n\n(13) Why persons accustomed to sour wine, if they happen to drink sweet-flavoured wine at a party (\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u0631), are slow in getting drunk.\n\n(14) Why those who live on oily food are slow in getting drunk.\n\n(15) Why those who take little exercise are slow in getting drunk, while those who take much exercise get drunk quickly.\n\n(16) Why some men, when they drink wine, are more than usually grave and dignified, while others are more than usually light-headed and ill-mannered.\n\n(17) Why crapula (\u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631) is worse than drunkenness.\n\n(18) Why sometimes when men drink wine it produces nausea, while at other times men suffering from nausea are cured by drinking wine.\n\n(19) Why, when a man drinks much wine, it produces constipation (\u0627\u0645\u0633\u0627\u06a9), but if he drinks moderately, it has a laxative effect.\n\n(20) Why some drunken men sleep a great deal, while others sleep little, and, if they once wake, keep awake all night.\nP. 74. (Section 8, on the nature of wine).\n\nP. 76. (Section 9, on the stages of drunkenness): (1) It relieves a man from care, and makes him bolder, and brings a fresh colour to his face. All the benefits of wine, which have been enumerated, belong to this stage. (2) It disorders the bodily and mental faculties, so that a man begins to dance and sing, and to sport with his inferiors, and to annoy those present. (3) It deprives a man of reason, and reduces him to the lowest degradation. The consequences are epilepsy, apoplexy, hemiplegia, facial paralysis, and sudden death. Hippocrates allows this kind of drunkenness once a month.\n\nP. 77. (Section 10, on the causes of getting drunk quickly). Four causes are mentioned.\n\nP. 79. (Section 11, explaining when wine should be drunk). It should not be drunk on an empty stomach, but is beneficial to those who have a 'cold' stomach. Five signs of a 'cold' stomach.\n\nP. 82. (Section 12, explaining what a man should eat that he may drink heartily and be slow in getting drunk).\n\nP. 82. (Section 13, on some results of drinking wine). When a man becomes a slave to the pleasures of wine, he neglects all worldly and religious affairs. The author\nA PERSIAN MANUSCRIPT\n\ngives three prescriptions calculated to render wine distasteful. Several things which take the smell of wine out of the mouth are mentioned.\n\n(Section 14, on the different kinds of wine). Wine has seven distinguishing characteristics: (1) colour, (2) taste, (3) smell, (4) consistency, (5) place where it was grown, (6) rawness or ripeness, (7) newness or oldness. Further subdivisions are enumerated under each of these heads. Finally, the author mentions (8) raisin-wine, and wines made from rice and millet.\n\n(Part III, on the various sorts of beverages employed in health and disease). Sweet sherbet, oxymel, and fuqqa\u2018 are mentioned, and the merits of each discussed.\n\n(Section 15, on remedies for symptoms which show themselves in the drinking of wine).\n\n(Section 16, on the cure of crapula).\n\n(Fifth Discourse, on the regulation of victuals).\n\n(Part I, on the natures of simples). Of all grain, wheat is the most suitable for man. There are two kinds of bread, (a) bread made from fine flour, (b) bread made from dry\nflour (\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0634\u06a9 \u0622\u0631\u062f). Bread may be divided into four classes according to the way in which it is compounded: (a) unleavened bread (\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0638\u06cc\u0631), (b) bread baked in earth, (c) bread baked in an iron pan (\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0646\u06cc), (d) bread baked in ashes (\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u062c).

After discussing the nature of sleep the author enumerates\u2014(1) the benefits of sleep: (a) it gives rest to the faculties, (b) it aids digestion, (c) the vital warmth is collected and strengthens the body, (d) the body is supplied with moisture. The injurious effects of sleep in certain cases are next described, and the author goes on to explain (2) the proper way to sleep. The sleeper should lie for an hour on his right side and then turn to his left side. Sleeping face downwards is an aid to digestion, while sleeping on the back rests the body better than any other posture.\n\nIn conclusion, I transcribe two passages which will afford a fair specimen

fuqq\u0101' in terms of strong depreciation, except Ibn Mandavaih of I\u1e63fah\u0101n, who uses milder language. In fact, being what it is, it is impure and does not admit of safe digestion, as it produces raw phlegmatic humours. Seyyid Ism\u0101'il (God have mercy on him!) says that if a person cannot abstain from fuqq\u0101', three mans of raisins should be put in water along with a man of sugar. When the sugar melts, the mixture should be boiled and strained, and pomegranate juice, or sour apple juice, or sour quince juice added in the desired quantity. If a mixture inclining to sweetness is preferred, the sour ingredients must be diminished, and vice versa. In the latter case rue, mint, tarragon, a little spikenard, and a little salt are excellent; in the former, cinnamon, aloes, cloves, ginger, and a little sugar, as much of each as, without drowning the fuqq\u0101', will give it fragrance and flavour and make it palatable. The sweet mixture is more proper for those who have a moist constitution, but honey, instead of sugar, is better. A person whose stomach is weak must add a larger quantity of spikenard and cardamom. If his constitution is hot and he wishes to relax it by means of this fuqq\u0101', he must put in hydromel instead of sugar, and apricot juice instead of pomegranate. Remedy: Khw\u0101ja Ab\u016b \u2018Al\u012b says that care must be taken not to drink fuqq\u0101' after wine or wine after fuqq\u0101', because, when wine is mixed with fuqq\u0101', it conveys the fuqq\u0101' to the interior of the system, and grave mischiefs ensue. If fuqq\u0101' is drunk and injurious effects show themselves, nothing should be taken on the top of it except peeled walnuts and bleached almonds, that the oil of these, mingling with the fuqq\u0101', may thicken it and hinder it from penetrating the veins. The patient should dip his fingers in honey and lick them several times. Ghee and an electuary of zar\u02bf\u016bni are antidotes to fuqq\u0101'.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\n\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0633\u0648\u0645 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0632\u0647

is not yet over as long as the complexion is bright and motion agreeable, the veins full, and the breathing regular. Until the constitution becomes habituated to exercise, it is a principle of great importance that, if the temperament be hot and dry, the exercise should not be too severe; if it be moist, and cold predominate, exercise may be carried to this point and even further. At first the motions should be gentle, and should gradually increase in violence till they attain a maximum which the person taking exercise cannot easily endure to pass. Similarly he should by slow degrees relax his efforts until he leaves off. Before taking exercise the arms and legs and back of the athlete should be rubbed in moderation by different hands or with a rough towel, and then with sweet oil, e.g. almond oil or fresh oil of sesame, and when his muscles are supplied and he has been gently rubbed, he should indulge in exercise. This rubbing, which helps to stir up the vital heat and\nopens the pores and brings superfluities to the surface so that they admit of being expelled by exercise, is proper for a person whose muscles are hard, whose pores are close, and who has lived on coarse diet. A person whose muscles are soft and whose diet has not been coarse need not be rubbed and supplied with oil to the same extent, but when he has finished his exercise he should go to the bath, or sit in the court of the house and pour tepid water over his body to give ease to the skin. He should also be rubbed gently a second time, and while this is proceeding he should stretch his arms and legs and muscles, in order that the remaining superfluities, which the motion has dissolved, may escape at the pores and be completely expelled. It is proper to use oil in this rubbing. For one whose muscles are hard and whose diet consists of solid food a second rubbing is necessary, but a person with soft muscles who does not live on solid food, as he should not take the same exercise, may dispense with the rubbing also, and if he does require it, may be less exigent.\nART. III.\u2014The Sources of Dawlatsh\u00e2h; with some Remarks on the Materials available for a Literary History of Persia, and an Excursus on B\u00e2rbad and R\u00fbdagi. By Edward G. Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nAt the International Congress of Orientalists held in Paris in September, 1897, I had the honour of submitting to my fellow-students there assembled a scheme for the publication of a series of Persian historical and biographical texts, to be inaugurated by a critical edition of Dawlatsh\u00e2h's Tadhkiratu'sh-Shu'\u00e2rd, or \"Lives of the Persian Poets.\" The carrying out of this scheme was made conditional on the promise of so much support as should ensure the sale (at a price less by one-third than that at which the volume would subsequently be sold to non-subscribers) of at least 200 copies. It is a matter of some disappointment to me that during the year which has elapsed since this announcement was made the number of subscribers has hardly reached the quarter of this modest minimum; in spite of which discouraging fact I have resolved to proceed with an undertaking of the necessity of which I am more than ever convinced. The arrangements for publication are completed: the texts will be printed by Messrs. Brill at Leyden with the Beyrout types (adapted to the Persian usage by the addition of the four supplementary letters required by that language); and Messrs. Brill and Luzac will act as joint publishers. It is hoped that the first volume of the series may be ready in time to be laid before the Congress of Orientalists which will meet at Rome next October.\n\u00a7 I. THE SOURCES OF DAWLATSH\u0100H.\n\nDawlatsh\u0101h has not thought fit to save his readers the trouble of finding out for themselves from what sources he drew his information by including in his preface, as does the excellent author of the T\u0101rikh-i-Gus\u012bda, a list of the books which he used in compiling his work. Such a list, however, I have constructed for my own use. In all he makes mention of 140 books (apart from div\u0101ns, kull\u016by\u0101t, and the like), but many of these are, of course, poetical works composed by the subjects of his memoirs, and not more than forty can be regarded as 'sources.' Of these, again, many are only referred to incidentally, while in some cases it is doubtful whether Dawlatsh\u0101h had any direct knowledge of their contents. In the following list, an asterisk is prefixed to those books of which I shall have something more to say.\n\n(1) The \u0100th\u0101ru'l-b\u0101qiya of al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b (\u2020 A.D. 1048), which Sachau has edited (Leipzig, 1878) and translated into German (Leipzig, 1878) and English (London, 1873). Once cited.\n\n(2) The Ihy\u0101'u'l-'ul\u016bm of al-Ghazz\u0101l\u012b (\u2020 A.D. 1111), printed at Cairo (A.H. 1278, 1282, 1306), Lucknow (A.H. 1281), etc. Once cited.\n\n(3) The Akhb\u0101ru't-\u1e6cuc\u0101l of Dinavari (\u2020 circ. A.D. 895), edited by Guirgass (Leyden, 1888). Once cited.\n\n(4) The Geography of al-I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri (\u2020 circ. A.D. 940), edited by De Goeje. Once cited.\n\n(5) The T\u0101ju'sh-Shuy\u016bkh, a Persian work of which H\u0101ji Khalfa knows nothing but the title. Once cited.\n\n(6) The T\u0101rikh-i-Istid\u1e25\u0101r\u012b, by which Dawlatsh\u0101h apparently means the Istid\u1e25\u0101r\u016b'l-akhb\u0101r of Q\u0101di Ahmad D\u0101mg\u0101n\u012b (one of the sources of the T\u0101rikh-i-Gus\u012bda), another of the books mentioned by H\u0101ji Khalfa of which he seems not to have had personal knowledge. Twice cited.\n(7) A history of the Salj\u016bqs variously cited by Dawlatsh\u0101h as T\u0101rikh-i-\u0100l-i-Salj\u016bq, T\u0101rikh-i-Salj\u016bq, and T\u0101rikh-i-Salj\u016bqa, with a vagueness which renders identification impossible.\n\n(8) The T\u0101rikh-i-Ban\u0101k\u012bti (composed A.D. 1317), an abridgement of Rash\u012bdu'd-D\u012bn's great history, common enough in manuscript, but never published in its entirety. Cited five times.\n\n(9) The T\u0101rikh-i-Bayhaqi (composed circ. A.D. 1060), edited by Morley and Nassau Lees (Calcutta, 1862) and utilized by Kazimirski in the introduction to his edition of Min\u016bchihri's Div\u0101n (Paris, 1886). Once cited.\n\n(10) The T\u0101rikh-i-Rash\u012bd\u012bt, more correctly entitled the J\u0101mi'u't-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh, completed by the talented and unfortunate minister Rash\u012bdu'd-D\u012bn Fadlu'll\u0101h (the patron and master of Hamdu'll\u0101h Qazv\u012bn\u012b, the author of the T\u0101rikh-i-Guzida) in A.D. 1310, eight years before his execution. An edition of this most important work is, I believe, being prepared by M. Zotenberg. Twice cited.\n\n(11) The T\u0101rikh-i-\u1e6cabar\u012b. The author of the Arabic original (at length rendered accessible to Orientalists in the Leyden edition by the heroic labours of De Goeje and his collaborators) died A.D. 923; and the Persian translation, which was probably used by Dawlatsh\u0101h, was made forty years later by Bal'\u0101m\u012b. Once cited.\n\n(12) The T\u0101rikh-i-'Abdu'r-Razz\u0101q, properly entitled Ma\u1e6dla'-i-sa'dayn wa Majma'i-bahrayn of Kam\u0101lu'd-D\u012bn 'Abdu'r-Razz\u0101q (\u2020 A.D. 1482). Once cited.\n\n*(13) The T\u0101rikh-i-Guzida, or \"Select History,\" of the worthy \u1e24amdu'll\u0101h Mustan\u1e93\u012bf\u012b of Qazw\u012bn, to whom we are also indebted for the geographical work entitled Nuzhatu'l-Qul\u016bb (of which a portion has been published by the lamented M. Schefner in the supplement to the Siy\u0101sat-n\u0101ma, Paris, 1897, pp. 141\u2013235), and the very rare metrical chronicle entitled\nDhafar-n\u0101ma (Rieu's Suppl. to Pers. Cat., pp. 172-174). The Gus\u012bda was composed in A.D. 1330; and a perusal of it, which I have just completed, has convinced me that it is one of the best manuals of history in Persian, and has decided me to make it the second or third volume of my series of texts. It is cited by Dawlatsh\u0101h five times.\n\n(14) The Tadhkiratul-Awliy\u0101 of Faridu'd-D\u012bn 'Att\u0101r (killed A.D. 1230). Several particularly good and ancient MSS. of this important Biography of Saints exist in London, Berlin, etc., but, so far as I know, no edition. Twice cited.\n\n*(15) The Tarjum\u0101nu'l-Bal\u0101ghat by the poet Farrukhi (\u2020 A.D. 1077-8), mentioned by H\u0101ji Khalf\u0101 (No. 2,894), but of which, to the best of my knowledge, no copy is known to exist. Twice cited.\n\n(16) A work once cited as Tav\u0101rikh-i-Maliksh\u0101hi with a vagueness which precludes identification.\n\n(17) The Jav\u0101hiru'l-Asr\u0101r of Sheykhl \u0100lhar\u012b, composed in A.D. 1436-7, described at p. 43 of Rieu's Persian Catalogue. Cited eight times.\n\n(18) The Jah\u0101n-Kush\u0101y of Juvayn\u012b, completed in A.D. 1260. Cited five times.\n\n*(19) The Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la (\"Four Discourses\") of the poet Nidh\u0101mi-i-'Ar\u016bdi of Samarqand, completed about A.D. 1160. Two MSS. of this valuable work (of which the portion referring to Firdaws\u012b, whose tomb the author visited in A.D. 1116-7, has been published and translated by Eth\u00e9 in vol. xlviii of the Z.D.M.G., pp. 89-94) are in the British Museum, and it is from them, not from the lithographed edition published at T\u012bhr\u0101n in A.H. 1305 (see Rieu's Pers. Suppl., pp. 244-5), that I have drawn the facts to which I shall presently refer. Cited thrice.\n\n(20) The \u1e24adda'iqu's-sihr (\"Gardens of Magic\"), a well-known work on Rhetoric and the Poetic Art by the poet Rashidu'd-D\u012bn Wa\u1e6du\u1e0d (\u2020 A.D. 1182-3) lithographed in T\u012bhr\u0101n, A.H. 1302. It was written\n(Rieu, *Pers. Suppl.*, p. 122) in order to supersede the *Tarjum\u0101n\u016b'l-Bal\u0101ghat* mentioned above. Cited six times.\n\n(21) The well-known history of \u1e24amsa of Isfah\u0101n (circa A.D. 960) partly edited by Gottwaldt (1836, 1844) and Rasmussen (1817). Once cited.\n\n(22) The *Dhakhira-i-Khw\u0101razmsh\u0101h\u012b*, a medical Encyclopaedia compiled in A.D. 1136-7 by Zaynu'd-D\u012bn Ab\u016b Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Isma'\u012bl al-Surj\u0101n\u012b.\n\n(23) The well-known *Ra\u1e0d\u1e0datu's-S\u016bf\u012b* of Mirkhr\u0101nd (\u2020 A.D. 1497), a contemporary of our author. Once cited, but only in the lithographed Bombay edition.\n\n(24) The *Siy\u0101sat-n\u0101ma* (also called by Dawlatsh\u0101h, as well as by the author of the *Tart\u012bkh-i-Guz\u012bda, Siyaru'l-Mul\u016bk*) of that great statesman the *Nid\u1e25\u0101mu'l-Mulk* (assassinated in A.D. 1092); edited (Paris, 1891) and translated (1893) by the lamented M. Schefer. Another MS., of which the existence was apparently unknown to the learned editor, but which has in many obscure passages supplied me with valuable corrections and emendations, exists in the Library of King's College, Cambridge, No. 219 of the Pote collection. Once cited.\n\n(25) A history of the Prophet, of the identity of which I am uncertain, once referred to by Dawlatsh\u0101h as *Sharafu'n-Nab\u012b*.\n\n(26) The *Suv\u0101ru'l-Aq\u0101lim*. Several geographical works so entitled are known, but none, I think, by Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n Zakariyy\u0101 of K\u016bfa, to whom Dawlatsh\u0101h ascribes its authorship. Cited five times.\n\n(27) The *\u1e6cabaq\u0101t-i-N\u0101\u1e63iri* of J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, completed in A.D. 1260, published in part in the *Bibl. Ind.* series (Calcutta, 1864). Twice cited. Dawlatsh\u0101h also alludes twice to a *Maq\u0101m\u0101t-i-N\u0101\u1e63iri*, by which title he probably intends the same work.\n\n(28) The *Dhafar-n\u0101ma* of Sharafu'd-D\u012bn Yazd\u012b, composed in A.D. 1425, published in the *Bibl. Ind.* series (1887-8). Thrice cited.\n(29) The Q\u0101b\u016bs-n\u0101ma of Kay-K\u0101'\u016bs b. Sikandar b. Q\u0101b\u016bs b. Washmg\u012br, composed in A.D. 1082\u20133. See Leyden Cat., vol. iv, p. 207, and Pertech's Berlin Cat., pp. 302\u20133. The Persian text (of which I possess a MS. lacking chs. xlii\u2013xliv and part of xli) is much rarer than the Turkish version. Once cited.\n\n(30) The Kit\u0101bu 'ad\u0101bi'l-'Arab wa'l-Furs of Ab\u016b 'Al\u012b Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Miskawayh (\u2020 A.D. 1030). See Leyden Cat., vol. iv, pp. 191\u20132. Once cited.\n\n(31) The Kit\u0101bu'l-Mam\u0101lik wa'l-Ma\u1e63\u0101lik. It is not certain whether the work of Ibn Khurd\u0101dhbih (edited, with French translation, in the Journal Asiatique for 1865 by Barbier de Meynard, and again in the Bibl. Geogr. Arab. by De Goeje), composed about A.D. 870, or one of the other similar works bearing the same title is intended. See Rieu's Pers. Cat., vol. i, p. 423, from which it appears to me very probable that under this title Dawlatsh\u0101h really refers to H\u0101fidh Abr\u016b's geography, compiled for Sh\u0101h-rukh about A.D. 1417.\n\n*(32) The Mandiqibu'sh-Shu'ar\u0101 of Ab\u016b T\u0101hir al-Kh\u0101t\u016bn\u012b. This work, which appears to be lost, is mentioned by H\u0101ji Khalfa (No. 13,026), who states that it was written in Persian. The author is mentioned in 'Im\u0101du'd-D\u012bn's recension of al-Bund\u0101r\u012b's History of the Saljuqs in several places (ed. Houtsma, Leyden, 1889, pp. 89, 101\u20138, 110, and 113), and Arabic renderings of some of his Persian verses are given. One of his Persian verses is also cited in As\u0101di's Lughat-i-Furs (ed. Horn, Berlin, 1897, p. 11, s.v. \u063a, and p. 23), where his nisba is given as al-H\u0101n\u016b\u1e6d\u012b instead of al-Kh\u0101t\u016bn\u012b. He flourished, apparently, about the end of the eleventh century. His Biographies of the Poets, therefore, is at least half a century older than the Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la (No. 19 supra), and a century older than al-'Awf\u012b's Lub\u0101bu'l-Alb\u0101b, the oldest extant Persian work of this character, of which I shall have occasion to speak presently. Its recovery, therefore, would be of the greatest\npossible importance for the early history of Persian literature. Twice cited.\n\n(33) The *Nushatu'l-Qul\u00fbb* of *Hamdu'll\u00e2h Mustawfi* of Qazvin. See No. 13 supra. Once cited.\n\n(34) The *Na\u1e63\u1e25at-n\u00e2ma* of the *Nidh\u00e2m'u'l-Mulk* (\u2020 A.D. 1092). It is evident from the single citation that the spurious work, variously known as the *Wa\u1e63\u00e2y\u0101* and the *Na\u1e93\u1e0d'i\u1e25*, purporting to have been written by the great minister for his son Fakhru'l-Mulk, but in reality composed (see Rieu's *Pers. Cat.*, vol. ii, p. 446) in the fifteenth century of our era, is meant. It is responsible for the now famous legend about *\u02bfUmar-i-Khayy\u00e2m*, *\u1e24asan-i-Subb\u00e2h*, and the *Nidh\u00e2m'u'l-Mulk*.\n\n(35) The *Nidh\u00e2m'u't-Taur\u00eekh* of al-*Bayd\u00e2w\u00ee* (better known as the author of the celebrated commentary on the Qur\u02be\u0101n) who died about A.D. 1310. MSS. of this meagre and jejune record exist in the British Museum and elsewhere. Thrice cited.\n\n(36) The *Nafah\u00e2t'u'l-Uns* (Lives of \u1e62\u016bf\u012b saints) of *J\u00e2mi* (\u2020 A.D. 1492), who was contemporary with our author, edited by Nassau Lees (Calcutta, 1859).\n\n(37) The *Nig\u00e2rist\u00e2n* of *Mu\u02beinu'd-D\u00een Juraym\u00ee*, a work modelled on the *Gulist\u00e2n* of *Sa\u02bfd\u00ee*, and composed in A.D. 1334\u20135.\n\nThe above list contains, I think, the titles of all the historical, geographical, and biographical works explicitly mentioned by Dawlatsh\u0101h. Of the oldest extant Biography of Persian Poets, the *Lub\u00e2bu'l-Alb\u00e2b* of *al-'Auw\u00ee* (composed about A.D. 1220) he seems to have had no knowledge, or at least he makes no mention of it; but, having regard to his references to Ab\u016b T\u0101hir al-Kh\u0101t\u016bn\u012b's *Man\u0101qib'u'sh-Shu'ar\u00e2* (which, as we learn from H\u0101ji Khalfa, was written in Persian), we cannot acquit him of insincerity in the claim to have opened out a new field of literary activity which he puts forward in his preface in the following words:\n\n\"Finally I retired, in grief, regret, sorrow, and distraction, into the cell of failure, and took up my abode in the corner\nof seclusion; but weariness at the futility of my life overcame my spirit, when [verse] 'The unseen voice of Reason thus did cry'\u2014\n\n[Couplet] 'Sit not idle; o'er the paper urge the pen:\nIf thou canst not, trim the reed for better men!'\n\n\"When the treasury of ideals was thus disclosed, I perceived that the Pen was the Dragon which guarded that Treasure; and, conspiring with the double-tongued Reed, I cried, 'O Key to the Coffers of Knowledge, I take counsel with thee as to what writing shall result from the labour of my fingers and thy teeth!' The Pen, in its rasping accents, answered as follows\u2014\n\n[Couplet] 'What was worthy of the saying, said and said again hath been;\nOn the fields and plains of knowledge naught remains for you to glean.'\n\n'Devout and dispassionate divines have compiled exhaustive biographies and manuals, and have opened the doors of hagiology to all mankind. His Holiness Shaykh 'At\u1e6d\u0101r (may his resting-place be rendered fragrant by the brightest of sweet flowers!) has produced his masterly Memoirs of the Saints. Learned historians have written volumes on the history and gests of mighty monarchs. So likewise in the sciences of topography and the principles of political economy accomplished scholars have strenuously exerted themselves to do what was needful, and have left of themselves worthy memorials.\n\n[Couplet] 'All that now remains untreated, all that's still to do on earth,\nIs to write the poets' lives and strive to fix the poets' worth.'\n\n'For men of learning, notwithstanding their skill and attainments, have not condescended to take this trouble; while other persons have not been favoured by opportunity, or, perhaps, have lacked the necessary attainments. In\nshort, not a creature amongst the men of letters has recorded\nthe history, biography, and circumstances of this class. If,\ntherefore, you can produce a worthy volume on this subject,\nit will assuredly be a work of utility.'\n\n\"So when I, the broken in spirit, heard from the custodian\nof the treasure-house of ideas these suggestions, I perceived\nthat this quarry had indeed hitherto escaped the nets of the\nhuntsmen of this craft, and that this door had remained\nshut in the faces of all seekers. Therefore I made a com-\npilation of the notes which I had taken at odd times during\nmy life, and of the sheaves which I had gleaned from the\nharvests of men of honourable repute, from accredited\nhistories, the dir\u0101ns of past masters, the poems of the\nancients and moderns, miscellanies, books of anecdotes, and\nthe like, of whatever bore reference to the history, geists,\nand circumstances of the great poets, who are well known by\ntheir works or their reputation and remembered throughout\nthe climes of the world; introducing also into this my\nMemoir, as occasion offered, somewhat of the histories of the\ngreat kings, from the beginning of the Mu\u1e25ammadan era\nuntil our own time, in whose reigns illustrious poets have\nflourished; and further incorporating in my book so much\nas I was able, according to the measure of my power and\ncapacity, of the compositions of the most eminent writers,\nand of entertaining anecdotes concerning the great poets,\nbesides sundry data for a critical knowledge of topography.\"\n\n\u00a7 II. The Materials for a Literary History\nof Persia.\n\nThis monstrous pretension on the part of Dawlatsh\u0101h\n(who avowedly made use of Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101hir al-Kh\u0101t\u016bn\u012b's lost\nBiography of Poets, as well as of the immensely interesting\nsecond section of Nidh\u0101m\u012b al-\u02bfAr\u016b\u1e0d\u012b as-Samarqandi's Four\nDiscourses, entitled \"On the nature of Verse and the Poetic\nArt,\" and the generally brief, but original and suggestive,\nnotices of Persian poets\u2014about ninety in number\u2014contained\nin ch. v, \u00a7 6, of the *T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Guz\u012bda*) naturally caused me to consider what really were the most ancient and trustworthy sources whence a fuller knowledge of the early literary history of Persia might be derived, and whether the valuable researches of Dr. Eth\u00e9 and the brilliant generalizations of the late Professor Darmesteter really represented the final limits attainable in this direction. Now Dr. Eth\u00e9's results were largely drawn from the Berlin Codex of al-'Awfi's *Lub\u0101bu'l-Alb\u0101b* (described at pp. 596\u20137 of Pertsch's *Berlin Cat. of Pers. MSS.*), which for a long time I believed to be unique, at any rate in Europe. This year, however, the *Hand-list of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish Manuscripts* in the *Bibliotheca Lindesiana* was privately printed; and to the extraordinary generosity of Lord Crawford of Balcarres and the courtesy of his Librarian, Mr. Edmond, I am indebted not only for a copy of this work, but for the loan of the priceless manuscript of al-'Awfi's *Lub\u0101b*, described at p. 226 of the same and numbered 308. This proves to be the identical manuscript (formerly belonging to John Bardoe Elliot, Esq., of the Suddur Court of Calcutta) described by Bland in that classical account of \"the earliest Persian Biography of Poets,\" which was read before our Society on February 17, 1846, and is printed in Vol. IX of our Journal, pp. 111\u2013126. The author, N\u016bru'd-D\u012bn or Jam\u0101lu'd-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad 'Awfi (see, besides Bland, Sprenger and Pertsch, Rieu's *Pers Cat.*, pp. 749\u2013751, s.v. *J\u0101mi'u'l-Hik\u0101yat*) lived at Dihli in the reign of \u012altutmish (A.D. 1210\u20131235), but had travelled in Persia, especially Khuras\u0101n, and was very well informed. His *Lub\u0101b* may fairly be regarded as the *Kit\u0101bu'l-Agh\u0101ni* of Persia, and, as it unquestionably ought to be printed, I am now engaged in transcribing it, so that it may form the second or third volume of the Persian Text Series. It contains notices of 122 royal and noble personages who occasionally condescended to write verse, and of about 163 poets by profession, of whom thirty belong to the T\u0101hiri, \u1e62aff\u0101ri, and S\u0101m\u0101ni periods; twenty-nine to the Ghaznavi period; and fifty to the Salj\u016bq period; while\nsome fifty-four are, roughly speaking, the author's contemporaries. As to its character, Bland well observes (loc. cit., p. 114), \"the biographical notices are of comparatively little value, but the merit of the work consists in its having preserved some hundreds of beautiful Casidahs, Ghazals, and other poetry nowhere else to be met with in an entire state, and without curtailment.\"\n\nNow at the beginning of the section, immediately following the Table of Contents, al-'Awfi makes (though with better reason) the same claim that Dawlatsh\u0101h advanced 275 years later to have produced the first Biography of Persian poets. He says:\u2014\"Although this boldness and impertinence was beyond the scope of this humble personage [the author], that he should be able to render service to the Royal Library by strewing comfits [culled] from the sweetmeat-scatterers of genius, or to sprinkle the rose-water of poesy from the tavern of meditation on the sleeve-cuffs of the servants of this Dynasty, yet hath he applied himself to this task, relying on the generosity of his master. For although several works and sundry treatises on this subject have undoubtedly been written on the Classes [Tabaq\u0101t] of Arabic poets (such as the Tabaq\u0101t of Ibn Sal\u0101m, and of Ibn Qutayba, and of Ibn 'l-Mu'tazz, and the Yatimatul-d-Dahr composed by Ab\u016b Mans\u016br ath-Th\u0101'libi, and the Duyyatu-l-Qasr written by the \u1e6c\u0101ju-r-Ru'asa al-\u1e24usayn b. 'Ali al-B\u0101kharz\u012b, and the Zaynatu'z-Zam\u0101n compiled by Shamsu'd-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad of Andakh\u016bd), yet no work has been seen and no manual has come under observation which treats of the Classes of Persian Poets.\"\n\nFrom this we may infer that the Man\u0101qibu'sh-Shu'tar\u0101 of Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101hir al-Kh\u0101tun\u012b was unknown to al-'Awfi; neither does he make any mention of the Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la (which, moreover, valuable as it is for the early history of the Persian poets, would hardly come under the title Tabaq\u0101t) in the short notice (Bland MS., pp. 436\u20137) which he consecrates to Nidham\u012b-i-'Ar\u016b\u1e0d\u012b of Samarqand. The Arabic works which he mentions do, however, suggest a new and, as I am convinced, a very fruitful line of\nenquiry to him who makes the earliest period of the post-Sasanian literary history of Persia the object of his study.\n\nOf the six Arabic works enumerated by al-'Awfi, the *Yat\u012bmatu'd-Dahr* of Ab\u016b Mans\u016br ath-Th\u0101'\u0101lib\u012b of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br (d. A.D. 1038, but was engaged on the *Yat\u012bma* as early as A.D. 994) is the best known, and to it only have I at present had access, in the printed Damascus edition of A.H. 1302. Of the others, the *Tabaq\u0101t* of Ibn Qutayba of D\u012bnavar (d. A.D. 883\u20134) exists in the Vienna Library (Fl\u00fcgel's *Cat.*, vol. ii, pp. 325\u20136); the *Tabaq\u0101t* of Ibnu'l-Mu'tazz (killed A.D. 908) and of Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn Sal\u0101m al-Jum\u0101mi (d. A.D. 845\u20136) are mentioned by H\u0101j\u012b Khalf\u0101 (vol. iv, pp. 144\u20135), but I know of no existing copies; the *Dumyatu'l-Qa\u1e63r* of al-B\u0101kharz\u012b (d. A.D. 1075), a supplement to the *Yat\u012bma*, exists in numerous MSS. (see W\u00fcstenfeld's *Geschichtschreiber d. Araber*, No. 211, pp. 70\u201371); while of the *Zaynatu'z-Zom\u0101n* and its author al-Andakh\u016bd\u012b I can find no notice whatever.\n\nNow if we understand the term 'Literary History' not in that narrow sense which takes cognizance only of what is written in a particular language, but in the wider and truer sense which Jusserand gives to it in his *Literary History of the English People* (London, 1895), namely, the manifestation in literature of the mind of a nation, or in other words its subjective history, then we shall readily see that, contrary to what is often expressed or implied, there is in fact no break in the Literary History of Persia since Sasanian times, but at most a change in the vehicle or medium of expression. Thus understood, a complete Literary History of the Persians would have to consider documents in not less than five different languages, ranging over a period of at least 2550 years, to wit:\n\n(1) The *Avesta*, to the earliest portions of which we may for the present (following the very clearly expressed\n\n---\n\n1 See, however, Brockelmann's *Gesch. d. Arab. Lit.* (Weimar, 1897), p. 105, n. 3. The writer in question is here called Abu 'Abdu'll\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sall\u0101m al-Jum\u0101hi, and it is stated that his *Tabaq\u0101tu'sh-Shu'ar\u0101* was largely used by the author of the *Kit\u0101bu'l-Agh\u0101ni*.\nreasonings of Dr. A. V. Williams Jackson in his article in vol. xvii of the Journal of the American Oriental Society \"on the date of Zoroaster\") assign a date not anterior to the middle of the seventh century B.C.\n\n(2) The Old Persian inscriptions of the Achaemenians, which lie between the middle of the sixth and the middle of the fourth centuries B.C.\n\n(3) The Pahlavi literature, belonging mainly to the Sasanian period (A.D. 226-640), of which the earliest important monument is probably the inscription of Shapur I (A.D. 241-272) at Haji-abad near Istakhr, while amongst the latest are the curious Gujastak Abalish (ou Abalag), relation d'une conf\u00e9rence th\u00e9ologique pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le Calife Mamoun (ed. Barthelemy, Paris, 1887), which obviously cannot have been written earlier than A.D. 813, the date of al-Ma'mun's accession to the Caliphate; the Epistle of Manushchihar dated A.D. 881; the Bundahishn \"finally edited in the latter part of the ninth century\" (West); the Dinkard \"first compiled early in the ninth century,\" etc. West, indeed, in his admirable article on \"the extent, language, and age of Pahlavi literature\" (Sitzungsbericht. d. philos.-philol. Classe d. K\u00f6nigl. Akad. d. Wissenschaften, May 5, 1888), says (p. 438) \"that nearly half the Pahlavi literature extant must have been compiled during the ninth century; much of it, no doubt, from older materials.\" It thus appears that, even when we leave out of consideration the Arabic literature of Persian authorship, modern (i.e. post-Muhammadan) Persian literature had begun before Pahlavi literature had ceased.\n\n(4) The Arabic literature (both prose and verse) composed by Persians. It has long been recognized, even by the Arabs themselves, how important was the contribution made to what I may call \"the Culture of the Caliphate\" in almost every branch of science and art by Persians like Sibawayhi and Kisa'i (in grammar), Zamakhshari and Baydawi (in exegesis), Tabari, Ibn Qutayba, Dinawari, Hamza, Baladhuri, and Biruni (in history), Razi, Avicenna, and Ghazzali (in philosophy and medicine), 'Umar al-Khayyam\nand Na\u1e63\u012bru\u2019d-D\u012bn T\u016bs\u012b (in astronomy and mathematics), and, most noteworthy, perhaps, of all, Ibnu\u2019l-Muqaffa\u2019, the converted Magian and erudite Pahlav\u012b scholar, whose Arabic style was nevertheless so good that his verses are cited with approval by competent judges, his Kad\u012bla and Dimna is still read and admired wherever Arabic is understood, and he himself is even mentioned by Ibn Khald\u016bn in his Prolegomena (ed. Beyrout, 1879, p. 527) as one of ten Arabic writers who are to be taken as models of eloquence. But I am thinking at present more particularly of the court-chroniclers and court-poets, mostly of purely Persian extraction, who were attached to the Persian dynasties of the Houses of Layth, S\u0101m\u0101n, Ziy\u0101r, B\u016bya, etc., but who nevertheless made Arabic (which, almost till the Monghol invasion and final extinction of the Caliphate in the thirteenth century, remained the language of science, diplomacy, and polite conversation throughout the Muhammadan world) the vehicle of their records and their eulogies, or, when occasion arose, of their satires. It is on these men and the circumstances of their life that works like the Yat\u012bmatu\u2019d-Dahr throw so abundant a light.\n\n(5) Lastly comes Persian literature as commonly understood, a literature covering a period of a thousand years, during which the language has changed so little that a Persian of to-day experiences less difficulty in understanding the poems of R\u016bd\u0101g\u012b or Firdaws\u012b than does an Englishman in understanding Shakespeare.\n\nHaving said so much as to the general lines on which, as it appears to me, Persian Literary History should be studied, I will conclude this section by recapitulating the chief sources to which I shall hereafter have occasion to refer, and the abbreviations by which I shall designate them.\n\nI. Arabic Sources.\n\n(1) The Yat\u012bmatu\u2019d-Dahr (referred to as Yat\u012bma) of Ab\u016b Ma\u1e63\u02bf\u016br ath-Tha\u02bf\u0101lib\u012b (\u2020 A.D. 1038), Damascus edition of A.H. 1302. The first volume deals mainly with\nthe poets of Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor, including Sayfu\u2019d-Dawla, Ab\u016b Fir\u0101s, the Hamd\u0101nids of Mosul and Aleppo, Mutanabbi, N\u0101m\u012b, N\u0101sh\u012b, Z\u0101h\u012b, Babagh\u0101, \u0160\u0101bi, Sirri, etc. The second volume deals with the poets patronized by the B\u016byid dynasty (in Ba\u1e63ra, Baghdad, and the rest of \u2018Ir\u0101q). The third volume includes the poets patronized by the \u0160\u0101hib Abu\u2019l-Q\u0101sim Isma\u2018il ibn \u2018Abb\u0101d, and those of Isfah\u0101n, al-Jabal, F\u0101rs, Ahw\u0101z, and Gurg\u0101n, and ends with an account of the Ziy\u0101rid Prince Shamsu\u2019l-Ma\u2018\u0101li Q\u0101b\u016bs b. Washmg\u012br, who has been already mentioned (p. 42 supra) in connection with the Persian Q\u0101bus-n\u0101ma. The fourth volume contains the S\u0101m\u0101nid poets, and those of Khw\u0101razm, Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and Nish\u0101p\u016br.\n\n(2) The \u0100th\u0101ru\u2019l-Bil\u0101d of al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b (\u2020 A.D. 1283\u20134), W\u00fcstenfeld\u2019s ed. (G\u00f6ttingen, 1848), referred to as Qasw\u012bn\u012b. This discursive work contains notices of a considerable number of Persian poets, and cites a good many Persian verses. Unfortunately it has no index; a defect which it has cost me a good deal of time to supply in my own copy. The Persian poets mentioned in it are as follows: Anvar\u012b (p. 242), \u2018Asj\u0101d\u012b (p. 278), Avhadu\u2019d-D\u012bn Kirm\u0101n\u012b (p. 164), Balahbad (= B\u0101rbad), the minstrel of Khusraw Parviz, of whom I shall have something to say presently (pp. 156, 295), Fakhri-i-Gurg\u0101n\u012b (p. 351), Farrukh\u012b (p. 278), Firdaus\u012b (pp. 135, 278), Jal\u0101l-i-Khw\u0101r\u012bz\u012b (p. 243), Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b (pp. 272, 404), al-Kh\u0101t\u016bn\u012b [Ab\u016b T\u0101hir] (p. 259), Mu\u1e63\u1e6dar-i-Baylaq\u0101n\u012b (p. 345, cf. p. 338), Nidh\u0101m\u012b of Ganja (pp. 351\u20132), Ab\u016b Sa\u2018id b. Abi\u2019l-Khayr (pp. 241\u20132), Sana\u2018\u012b (p. 287), Shams-i-\u1e6cab\u0101s\u012b (p. 272), \u2018Umar-i-Khayy\u0101m (p. 318), \u2018Unsur\u012b (p. 278), and Watc\u0101t (pp. 223\u20134).\n\n(3) The Nihayatu\u2019l-Irab fi akhb\u0101r\u012b \u2019l-Furs wa\u2019l-\u2018Arab (Burckhart MS. in Cambridge University Library marked Qq. 225), referred to as Nih\u0101yat. A perusal of this rare and interesting work disposes me to\nthink that it is dismissed with too little respect by Professor Noeldeke (Gesch. d. Sasaniden, pp. 475-6). That the alleged circumstances of its composition are false can hardly be doubted; but it does not necessarily follow that the very ample narrative of Sasanian history, which purports to be drawn from Ibnu'l-Muqaffa's lost Siyaru'l-Muluk (the Arabic translation of the famous Khudha't-n\u00e2ma or \"Book of Kings\"), is unworthy of attention. At some future period I hope to devote a separate article to this very curious work, but in the meantime I will only say that it is clear to me that the author, whoever he was, had a knowledge of Persian, and was singularly well-informed as to the legends of Ancient Persia, and that one passage, if I correctly understand it, would seem to imply that the Ziy\u00e2rid dynasty (A.D. 928-1042) had not ceased to exist when he wrote. As regards his knowledge of Persian, I may instance an alleged superscription from a coin of Khum\u00e2ni (daughter and wife of Bahman, son of Isfandiy\u00e2r), which he gives as follows (f. 48b):\n\n\u0628\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631 [\u0628\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0631] \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0648 [\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u0648.

Sasaniden, p. 233):\u2014\"Now the Persians were wont to inscribe on their arrows [one of] three names, the name of 'the King,' and the name of 'the Man,' and the name of 'the Woman.' And Wahriz [MS. \u0648\u0647\u0631\u0632,\nWahzan] drew forth an arrow and glanced at it, and behold, thereon was 'Zandn,' the name of women. So, auguring ill from it, he replaced it and drew forth another, and behold, it was like the first, on it was the name of the woman. And he drew forth a third, and it happened so again. Then he thought within himself and said, 'Zandn\u2014the interpretation thereof can only be san \u0101n' (which, being interpreted, means\u2014\u0627\u0636\u0631\u0628 \u0630\u0627\u0643\u060c 'shoot this!'); and he augured well from it in this sense.\"\n\nII. Persian Sources.\n\n(1) The Lub\u0101bu'l-Alb\u0101b of al-'Awfi, Elliot MS. (see pp. 46\u20137 supra), referred to as 'Awfi. This very rare and important work dates, as already remarked, from the beginning of the thirteenth century.\n\n(2) The Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la (composed about A.D. 1160) of Nidh\u0101mi-i-'Ar\u016bd\u012b of Samarqand, cited from the notes (partly transcript, partly abstract) which I made in December, 1897, from the British Museum MSS. Or. 3507 and Or. 2955 (chiefly the former). It is referred to by its full title. It has been hitherto known chiefly by the notices of Firdaws\u012b (published by Eth\u00e9, see p. 40 supra, and utilized by Noeldeke in his Iranische Nationalepos, Strassburg, 1896) and of 'Umar-i-Khayy\u0101m (with whom the author was personally acquainted) which it contains; but the whole of this second section, dealing with \"the Nature of Verse and the Poetic Art,\" is remarkable alike for the interest of its matter and the excellence of its style, and ought to be published, or at least translated, without delay.\n\n(3) The T\u0101rikh-i-Guzida of \u1e24amdu'll\u0101h Mustawf\u012b of Qazwin, composed in A.D. 1329\u201330, and in particular the sixth and last section of Ch. v, which treats of the poets of the Arabs and the Persians. The MS.\nwhich I have chiefly used is one belonging to my friend Mr. Guy le Strange. It is itself modern, but offers on the whole a very correct text, and has been collated throughout with an ancient MS. at Shiraz, which has supplied many important additions and corrections.\n\n(4) The *Lughat-i-Furs* of Asadi (*circ. A.D. 1066*), edited from the unique Vatican MS. (dated *A.H. 733 = A.D. 1332*) by Dr. Horn (Berlin, 1897), and reviewed by me at pp. 153-5 of the J.R.A.S. for January, 1898. The importance of this book, not only as a lexicon, but as an anthology, is in no wise exaggerated by the learned editor. Indeed, it is little short of a revelation to find the nephew of the great Firdawsi, so long regarded as almost the father of Persian poetry, quoting the verses of so great a number (78) of poets whose very names had, in many cases, been previously unknown to us.\n\n\u00a7 III. B\u0101rbad and R\u016bdag\u012b, the Minstrels of the Houses of S\u0101s\u0101n and S\u0101m\u0101n.\n\nThe statements contained in the Persian *tadhkiras* as to \"the first person who composed Persian verse\" are, as has been generally recognized, unworthy of much attention. Most of them are mentioned by Kazimirski (*Menoutchehri*, pp. 6-9) and Blochmann (*Prosody of the Persians*, pp. 2-3). Two only, so far as I know, refer the origin of Persian poetry to Sasanian times. One of these (given on the authority of Ab\u016b T\u0101hir al-Kh\u0101t\u016bn\u012b by Dawlatshah, but not by \u2018Awfi) cites a verse which purports to have been deciphered from the Qa\u1e63r-i-Shirin (Kazimirski, loc. cit., p. 7), and which is presumably supposed to date from the time of Khusraw Parviz (*A.D. 590-627*); the other (given both by \u2018Awfi and Dawlatsh\u0101h) cites the well-known couplet ascribed to Bahr\u0101m G\u016br (*A.D. 420-438*) and his mistress Dil\u0101r\u0101m. \u2018Awfi further assures us that the King in\nquestion had composed a quantity of very fine Arabic poetry, which had been collected and arranged in *div\u0101n* form; and that he himself had seen and read a copy of this *div\u0101n*, which belonged to the \"Bridge-end Library of the Little Market of Bukh\u0101r\u0101,\" and from which he quotes some verses.\n\nThere is, however, another older tradition which tells of a poet or minstrel at the court of Khusraw Parviz named *B\u0101rbad* (\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0628\u062f) or (by Qazwini) *Balabhad* (\u0628\u0627\u0647\u0628\u062f).\u00b9 The question has arisen in my mind whether the difference between these two forms of the name may not be more easily explained by a misreading of the *Pahlav\u012b* rather than the *Arabic* script, since in *Pahlav\u012b* *k* and *l* on the one hand, and *x* and *h* on the other, are represented by the same character, and we have merely to assume a transposition of the two letters.\u00b2 This personage is referred to in the *Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la*, *\u02bfAwfi*, *Qazwini*, and the *Guzida*.\n\n(1) 'Awfi, after speaking of Bahr\u0101m G\u016br's alleged poetical activity, says (p. 23):\n\n> \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0639\u0647\u062f \u067e\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u0632 \u0646\u0648\u0627 \u062e\u0633\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0622\u0646\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0622\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0647\u0627\u0633\u062a\n> \u0628\u0633\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0633\u062a \u0641\u0627\u06a9\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0648\u0632\u0646 \u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0648 \u0642\u0627\u0641\u06cc\u062a \u0648 \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u0627\u06cc\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0633\u062a\n> \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0628\u0628 \u062a\u0639\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u062f \u0646\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u062f\n\n\u00b9 Since this was written, my attention has been called by Professor Bevan to older accounts of this personage, and other forms of his name. The account given by Qazwini occurs in a fuller and more correct form in Y\u0101q\u016bt (*\u2020 A.D. 1229*), ed. W\u00fcstenfeld, vol. iii, pp. 260 et seq. (where the minstrel is called \u0628\u0627\u0647\u0628\u062f, *Bahlabadh*, var. \u0628\u0644\u0647\u0628\u062f, *Bahlaband*), and vol. iv, pp. 112 et seq. (also \u0628\u0644\u0647\u0628\u062f); and, while following Qazwini, I have corrected his defective text by Y\u0101q\u016bt. See also the compendium of al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b's *Kit\u0101b al-Bul\u0101d\u0101n* (composed A.D. 903), ed. De Goeje (vol. v of *Bibl. Geogr. Arab.*), and Justi's *Iranisches Namenbuch* (Marburg, 1895), p. 237, s.v. *Pahlapet*, and the passages in the *Agh\u0101ni* of Ab\u016b'l-Faraj al-Isfah\u0101n\u012b (*\u2020 A.D. 957*) there cited.\n\n\u00b2 Even the assumption of transposition is not necessary in the form *Bahlabadh* given by Y\u0101q\u016bt. This form in the *Pahlav\u012b* character would be identical with *B\u0101rbad*.\n\"And in the reign of Parviz the royal melodies composed by B\u0101rbad were many, but they are remote from verse-metre, rhyme, and the observance of poetical congruities, for which reason we have not concerned ourselves to discuss them.\"\n\n(2) The Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la, after describing the effect which two couplets by \u1e24antala of B\u0101dghis,\u00b9 the panegyrist of Ya\u02bfq\u016bb b.

First, under the article F\u00e2rs (pp. 154-6), he says:\n\n\"The Persians imagine that amongst them [i.e., as it would appear, the old Kings of Persia, of whose greatness he has just been speaking] there existed ten persons, each unrivalled in his own order, even in Persia.\" These ten are Farid\u00fbn, Alexander, N\u00fbshirv\u00e2n, Bahram G\u00fbr, Rustam, Jamasp, Buzurjm\u00eehr, Balahbad, the sculptor whose art immortalized on the rocks of Bi-sut\u00fbn the form of Shabdiz, the favourite horse of Khusraw Parviz, and, lastly, Sh\u00eer\u00een's unfortunate lover Farh\u00e2d. Of Balahbad he says:\n\n\"And the eighth of them was Balahbad the minstrel, who excelled all mankind in minstrelsy, and he was minstrel to Kisr\u00e2 Abarw\u00eez; and when anyone desired to lay any\nmatter before Kisr\u0101, yet feared his anger, he communicated it to Balahbad, and gave him gifts to compose a poem on the matter and thereto an air, and to sing it before Kisr\u0101, who thereby was informed of the matter.\u201d\n\nAgain, in describing the sculptures and bas-reliefs of Bi-sut\u016bn, he says (p. 230):\n\n\u201cA\u1e25mad b. Mu\u1e25ammad al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b says:\u00b9 \u2018On the face of the Mountain of Bi-sut\u016bn is a portico cut out from the rock, in the midst of which is the figure of Kisr\u0101\u2019s horse Shabd\u012bz, with [Kisr\u0101] Abarwiz mounted upon it. And on the wall of the portico is the portrait of Sh\u012br\u012bn and her attendants, said to have been executed by Fu\u1e6drus,\u00b2 the son of Sinimm\u0101r,\u00b3 and Sinimm\u0101r was he who built Khawarnaq outside \u1e24\u012bra. Now the cause of this [i.e. the sculpturing of these portraits] was that Shabd\u012bz was the most intelligent of quadrupeds, the greatest in bodily strength, the most remarkable in disposition, and the most enduring in a long gallop. So long as his saddle was on him, he would neither make water nor void excrement; and so long as his bridle was on him, he would neither snort nor foam [with his mouth]. He had been presented to Abarwiz by the King of India. Now it happened that he [Shabd\u012bz] sickened, and his sickness waxed sore; and Kisr\u0101 said, \u201cWhoever brings me tidings of his death, him will I slay.\u201d So when [Shabd\u012bz] died, the Master of the Horse feared lest he should be questioned about him, and be compelled to give tidings of his death. So he came to Balahbad, Kisr\u0101\u2019s minstrel, and asked him to make it known to Kisr\u0101 in a song. Now Balahbad was the most skilful of men in minstrelsy, and he did this. And when Kisr\u0101 hearkened to it, he divined its purport, and said, \u201cWoe unto thee! Shabd\u012bz is dead!\u201d And [Balahbad] said, \u201cIt is the King that sayeth it.\u201d And Kisr\u0101 said, \u201cWell done!

Then he ordered Fu\u1e6drus the son of Sinimm\u0101r to make a portrait of him, which he executed in the finest manner, in such wise that it was scarcely possible to distinguish between the two [i.e. the portrait and the original], save by the [presence or absence of the] movements of life in their forms.\u201d\n\nOn the next page (231) Qazw\u012bn\u012b quotes some Arabic verses by Kh\u0101lid al-Fayy\u0101\u1e0d (d. circ. A.D. 718)\u00b2 which give substantially the same legend:\n\n\"And King Kisr\u0101, the Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h, him also an arrow,\nfeathered from the wing of Death, overtook,\nWhat time his pleasure was Shabd\u012bz, whom he used to ride, and\nthe coy embraces of Shir\u012bn, and brocades and perfumes.\nHe swore an oath by the Fire (most binding was it in its\nstrength) that whosoever first should bring him tidings\nof the death of Shabd\u012bz should be crucified.\nUntil, when one morning Shabd\u012bz lay low in death (and never\nwas a steed like him amongst men),\nFour strings wailed over him with a lament in the Persian\ntongue wherein was an incitement to emotion.\nAnd the Herbed\u00b3 set the chords vibrating, and bursts of passion\nwere kindled by reason of the witchery of his left hand,\nAnd he cried, \u2018[Shabd\u012bz] is dead!\u2019 They said, \u2018Thou hast\ndeclared it!\u2019 So perjury was committed by him while\nhe was beside himself.\nHad it not been for Bahalbadh,\u2074 while the strings sang his\n[Shabd\u012bz\u2019s] threnody, the Marzub\u0101ns\u2075 would have been\nunable to announce the death of Shabd\u012bz.\n\n\u00b9 This sentence is rendered unintelligible in Qazwini by the omission of several\nwords which I have supplied from Y\u0101q\u016bt (vol. iii, p. 251), who is confirmed by\nHamadh\u0101n\u012b.\n\u00b2 See Rieu\u2019s Arabie Cat., p. 260; Arabie Suppl., p. 650.\n\u00b3 Y\u0101q\u016bt (iii, 252) has the variant \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0647\u0630\u064a\u0628, which, however, is incompatible\nwith the metre.\n\u2074 Y\u0101q\u016bt has \u062a\u0647\u0630\u064a\u0628 Bahalbadh.\n\u2075 Read for \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0632\u064a\u0628 (in Qazwini), (Y\u0101q\u016bt).\nFate was cruel and pitiless to them, and nothing more could be seen of them but the trifles [wherewith they diverted themselves].\u201d\n\nBalabad is again mentioned by Qazw\u012bn\u012b under the article Q\u0101sr-i-Sh\u012br\u012bn (pp. 295\u20137), where he says:\u2014\u201cKisr\u0101 Abarwiz had three things which no king before or after him hath had, his wife Shir\u012bn, his minstrel Balabad, and his horse Shabd\u012bz.\u201d A little further on, after describing the magnificent park which Khusraw Parviz caused to be laid out for his delectation near Qinnasr\u012bn, he continues:\n\n\u201cAnd when it was finished, the King [Parviz] inspected it, and it pleased him well, and he ordered the architects to be rewarded with wealth. And one day he said to Shir\u012bn, \u2018Ask me a favour.\u2019 She said, \u2018I desire that thou should\u2019st build for me a castle in this garden, the like of which none within thy realm hath possessed; and that thou should\u2019st place therein a channel lined with stone wherein wine shall flow.\u2019 To this he consented; but he forgot [his promise], and Shir\u012bn dared not remind him of it. So she said to Balabad, \u2018Remind him of my request in a song, and thou shalt have my farm which is at Isfah\u0101n.\u2019 To this he agreed; and he composed a poem on this subject and set it to music. And when Kisr\u0101 heard it, he said to him, \u2018Thou hast reminded me of Shir\u012bn\u2019s wish,\u2019 and he ordered the castle to be built and the watercourse to be made. So it was built in the handsomest and most solid style.

Both vocalizations are given by the Burh\u0101n-i-Q\u0101fi\u02bfi. The Anjuman-\u0101r\u0101-yi-N\u0101\u1e63\u012br\u012b of that accomplished scholar Rid\u0101-quli Kh\u0101n \"L\u0101l\u0101-b\u0101sh\u012b,\" poetically surnamed Hid\u0101yat, has the following notice:\n\n\"B\u0101rbad was the name of a man, a native of the town of Jahrum in F\u0101rs, who held the office of chamberlain under Khusraw Parviz. It was for this reason that he was called B\u0101r-b\u0101d, that is, 'Chief of the Audience-hall' (\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062f), for by his means men obtained access to the presence of Parviz. He had the greatest skill in the modes of music, and at Khusraw's banquets he and Nak\u012bsa [the harper] conducted to the enjoyment [of the guests].\"\n\nSo much for the legendary B\u0101rbad. It will be seen that he is represented as a minstrel rather than a poet; he is not a mere musician like his comrade Nak\u012bsa, but essentially a singer, an improvisatore, who, in the form of ballads, brings to the King's notice what it is desired that he should know. 'Awf\u012b, as we have seen, refuses to regard his ballads as poetry, alleging that they lacked \"metre, rhyme, and the observance of poetical congruities,\" but Qazw\u012bn\u012b, on the other hand, describes his improvisations as \"verse\" (\u0634\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0631). Perhaps they most closely resembled the ta\u1e63n\u012bfs of modern Persia\u2014ballads, generally with a refrain, referring to current events, passing from mouth to mouth, but seldom or never committed to writing, having both rhyme and metre, but of a very simple kind.\u00b9\n\nNow it seems to me that there exists a very striking analogy between B\u0101rbad the S\u0101s\u0101nian minstrel and R\u016bdag\u012b the S\u0101m\u0101nian poet, to illustrate which I shall quote the version given in the Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la of the well-known tale which tells how the latter, by the charm of his verse, succeeded in prevailing upon Na\u1e63r b.

In winter he used to reside at the capital, Bukh\u0101r\u0101, while in summer he used to go to Samarqand, or some other of the cities of Khur\u0101s\u0101n. Now one year it was the turn of Her\u0101t. He spent the spring at B\u0101dg\u012bs, where are the most charming pasture-grounds of Khur\u0101s\u0101n and \u2018Ir\u0101q, for there are nearly a thousand water-courses abounding in water and pasture, any one of which would suffice for an army.\n\n\"When the beasts had well eaten, and had recovered their strength and condition, and were fit for warfare or to take the field, Na\u1e63r b. A\u1e25mad turned his face towards Her\u0101t, but halted outside the city of Marghaz\u016br-i-Sap\u012bd and there pitched his camp. Cool breezes from the north were stirring, and the fruit was ripening in the districts of M\u0101lin and Kar\u016bkh\u00b9\u2014fruit such as can be obtained in but few places, and nowhere so cheaply. There the army rested.

Mihrj\u0101n was protracted, for the cold did not wax severe, and the grapes proved to be of exceptional sweetness. For in the district of Her\u0101t one hundred and twenty different varieties of the grape occur, each sweeter and more delicious than the other; and amongst them are in particular two kinds which are not to be found in any other region of the inhabited world, one called Parniy\u0101n and the other Gulch\u012bd\u012b, tight-skinned, slender-stalked,\u00b9 and luscious. . . . .

Then the narcissus began to bloom, and the raisins were plucked and picked in M\u0101lin, and hung up on lines, and packed in chests; and the Amir with his army moved into the two groups of hamlets called Gh\u016bra and Darw\u0101z.

Ahmad] sent the horses to B\u0101dg\u012bs, and moved his camp to M\u0101lin [to a spot] between two streams. And when summer came, the fruits again ripened; and when Mihrj\u0101n came he said, 'Let us enjoy Mihrj\u0101n at Her\u0101t'; and so from season to season he continued to procrastinate until four years had passed in this way. For it was then the heyday of the S\u0101m\u0101nian prosperity, and the land was flourishing, the kingdom unmenaced by foes, the army loyal, fortune favourable, and heaven auspicious; yet withal [the Am\u012br's attendants] grew weary, and desire for home arose [within their hearts], while they saw the King stationary, the air of Her\u0101t in his head and the love of Her\u0101t in his heart; and in the course of conversation he would express his preference of Her\u0101t to the Garden of Eden, and would place it above the spring-tide of Beauty.\n\n\"So they perceived that he intended to remain there for that summer also. Then the captains of the army and courtiers of the King went to Ab\u016b \u2018Abdu\u2019ll\u0101h R\u016bdag\u012b, than whom there was none more honoured of the King's intimates, and none whose words found so ready an acceptance. And they said to him, 'We will offer thee five thousand din\u0101rs if thou wilt contrive some artifice whereby the King may be induced to depart hence, for our hearts are dying for desire of our wives and children, and our souls are like to leave us for longing after Bukh\u0101r\u0101.' R\u016bdag\u012b agreed; and, since he had felt the Am\u012br's pulse and understood his temper, he perceived that prose would not affect him, and so applied himself to verse. He therefore composed a qas\u012bda; and, when the Am\u012br had taken his morning cup, came in, and did obeisance, and sat down in his place; and, when the musicians ceased, he took up the harp, and, playing the 'Lovers' air,' began this qas\u012bda:\u2014\n\n1 These verses, which vary slightly in different traditions, are very well known.

Every master of the craft, who has deeply considered the poetic art, will admit, after a little reflection, that I am right.\"\n\nI have given this rather lengthy citation from the Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la partly to make known one of the most ancient notices of him who is generally regarded as practically the father of\n\n1 See Houtsma's Recueil des textes relatifs \u00e0 l'Histoire des Seldjoucides, vol. ii, pp. 93, 101, 105.\nPersian poetry, and thus to supplement the notices contained in \u2018Awfi\u2019s and other *tadhkir\u0101s* made known by Dr. Eth\u00e9; partly to give some idea of the excellent, concise, telling style of Nidh\u0101m\u012b-i-\u2018Ar\u016bd\u012b of Samarqand\u2014a style which, unfortunately, is but too rare in Persian prose, especially in later days; partly to contrast this appreciation of R\u016bdag\u012b\u2019s genius with the opinion of Dawlatsh\u0101h, who flourished at a time and place where literary taste was profoundly vitiated (as witness the senseless rhodomontade of such books as the *Anv\u0101r-i-Suhayl\u012b*); but chiefly to emphasize the remarkable parallelism which exists between the perfectly historical R\u016bdag\u012b and the half-legendary B\u0101rbad. Both, it will be observed, have the same special virtue in the eyes of their contemporaries; through the medium of their skilful verse, accompanied, as it would appear, in both cases by music, they are able to bring to the notice of their wilful and dangerous masters matters to which others dare not direct their attention. Is it not possible that an older tradition thus survived from S\u0101s\u0101nian times to the period of what may be called the Persian Renaissance, and that the gradual loss of this tradition accounts for the inability of later critics to comprehend the beauty in R\u016bdag\u012b\u2019s verse, which their predecessors had recognized? For here is Dawlatsh\u0101h\u2019s judgment of the same verses:\n\n\u201cThis poem [of R\u016bdag\u012b\u2019s] is too long to be cited in its entirety in this place. It is said that it so delighted the King\u2019s heart that he mounted his horse and set out for Bukh\u0101r\u0101 without even stopping to put on his boots. To men of sense this appears astonishing, for the verses are extremely simple, entirely devoid of rhetorical artifices and embellishments, and lacking in strength; and if in these days anyone were to produce such a poem in the presence of kings or nobles, it would meet with the reprobation of all. It is, however, probable that as Master R\u016bdag\u012b possessed the completest knowledge of harmony and music [attainable] in that country, he may have composed some tune or air, and produced this poem of his in the form of a song with\nmusical accompaniment, and that it was in this way that it obtained so favourable a reception. In short, we must not lightly esteem Master R\u016bdag\u012b merely on account of this poem, for assuredly he was expert in all manner of arts and accomplishments, and has produced good poetry of several kinds, both *mathn\u0101vis* and *qas\u012bdas*, for he was a man of great distinction, and admired by high and low.\"\n\nIn future articles I hope to deal more fully with some of the sources enumerated in this paper, especially the *Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la*, the section of the *Guzida* treating of Persian poets, the Arabic compositions of Persian poets so abundantly illustrated in the *Yatima*, and, last but not least, the curious and problematical *Nih\u0101yatul-Irab*. But for the present I must refrain, seeing that my article has already exceeded the limits assigned to it. In conclusion I desire to express my gratitude to my friend and colleague Professor Bevan for his kindness in revising the proofs of this article, and for calling my attention to the notices of B\u0101rbad, Bahlabadh, or Balabhadh, given by Y\u0101q\u016bt and al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b.\nART. IV.\u2014The Theory of 'Soul' in the Upanishads. By T. W. Rhys Davids.\n\nThere is no work to which a student who wished to study the doctrine of Soul as set forth in the Upanishads could be referred. There are excellent popular accounts of later Indian beliefs. Professor Deussen has written a very complete and scholarly exposition of the views of the great Vedantist \u015aankar \u0100c\u0101rya.\u00b9 And Professor Garbe has now given us an equally valuable presentation of the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy.\u00b2 But \u015aankara is of the eighth century of our era (about 760\u2013820 A.D.); and the earliest corresponding commentary on S\u0101\u1e45khya\u2014that of Gandap\u0101da\u2014is approximately dated by Garbe between 700 and 750 A.D. The very curt texts which these old commentators expound, though of quite unknown date, are probably at least three centuries earlier. What the student would want would be the views on the subject current in the Valley of the Ganges 1,200 years earlier, before the time when Buddhism arose.\n\nThese views are nearly all contained in the Upanishads. This word means literally s\u00e9ances, 'sittings down near another,' but had very early acquired the connotation of the secret imparting of a deep mystery, more especially to a pupil seated in awe-struck attention by his teacher. The books so called are esoteric teachings of the higher mysteries of religion appended to the ritualistic or liturgical manuals of the Brahmans. And they contain (inter alia) the doctrine of the relation of God, or the gods, to the human soul.\n\nNeither the date nor the author of any one of these Upanishads is matter of certainty. But by the consensus of the scholars who have most thoroughly considered the\n\n\u00b9 Das Vedanta-system (Leipzig, 1883).\n\u00b2 Die S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophie (Leipzig, 1894).\nquestion (especially of Weber,\\(^1\\) of Regnaud,\\(^2\\) and of Deussen,\\(^3\\) who have discussed the question of date at some length), there are about a dozen of these treatises that may, with certainty, be considered as older than the rest, and as dating from before the rise of Buddhism down to a period not much later than that event (say from 800 or 700 B.C. down to 300 or 200 B.C.).\n\nAs to the exact order, in time, in which these older Upanishads should be arranged there are slight differences of opinion. The evidence is only of three kinds\u2014such as can be found in differences of style or language; in the relation of, or signs of progress in, the speculative opinions expressed; and in the comparison of the same or similar verses or episodes found in two or more of these ancient documents. Such evidence, in this as in other literatures, appeals with different force to different minds. But we shall not be far wrong if we take as a working hypothesis sufficient for our present purpose the conclusions reached by M. Regnaud,\\(^4\\) who gives the following chronological table:\n\n| Upanishad                          | Pages of this size |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| 1.

The \u012a\u015b\u0101, Kena, and M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya are really short edifying tracts, and the rest of Nos. 4 to 11 are very little more. It is moreover, to say the least, doubtful whether the last five are pre-Buddhistic. Our inquiry, therefore, will be chiefly confined to the earlier works in this list, and to such fragments of philosophical speculation as are to be found scattered in works still older than they are; that is to say, in the Vedas themselves and in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as.\n\nJust as these sacrificial hymns and liturgical treatises have preserved for us the evidence only of a late and much developed stage of religious belief, so also the Upanishads imply a long period of previous thought on ultimate philosophic questions. However vaguely expressed and incompletely reasoned out, these earlier attempts to reach the causes of things are of the greatest historical importance, insomuch as certain hypotheses they take for granted have continued, through the centuries, as the basis of nearly all Indian thought; and even when finally discarded have still influenced the tone, and the actual expressions, of the philosophy that discarded them.\n\nThe most far-reaching of these hypotheses was that of soul. As is well known, this hypothesis has been adopted, and no doubt quite independently, among so many different peoples in all parts of the world, that it may fairly be described as almost universal. It is even by no means certain that it is not quite universal; in which case its adoption is probably a necessary result of the methods of thought possible to men. But it is easily possible for us now, who no longer use the word \u2018soul\u2019 exclusively in its original sense, to misunderstand the ancient view, and to import into it modern conceptions. The oldest, and simplest, form of the hypothesis was frankly materialistic. The notion was that of a double\u2014shadowy, no doubt, and impalpable\u2014but still a physical double of the physical body.\n\nWe must try to put ourselves in the place of these early thinkers (if thinkers they can be called whose thought was only spontaneous and intuitive). The word \u2018hypothesis\u2019 was\nunknown to them. To the processes of consecutive reasoning they were entirely unaccustomed. Sensations experienced in dreams were as real to them as sensations experienced in the waking state; and in some respects they were nearer, in this matter, to the truth than we are. When a man after a hard-fought victory and a rude feast, perchance on the body of his foe, fought the battle over again, in his dreams, in the familiar glades, and awoke in terror at an impending blow to realize that all was over, and he was safe at home, the conclusion was inevitable that his foe had been alive again, that there was a something\u2014he knew not what\u2014which existed within the body, and was like the body, and which left it when the breath or life departed, to carry on elsewhere an existence of its own. He did not reason much about it, or stay to consider whether its existence was to be eternal or not. But he was too much frightened at it to forget it. And the dread reality afforded him a perfectly simple and a perfectly clear explanation of many otherwise mysterious things. When he awoke in the morning after hunting all night in his dreams, and learnt from his companions that his body had been there all the time, it was of course his 'soul' that had been away. And this 'soul' was in all respects a mysterious, misty, shadowy double of his waking body.\n\nWhen the 'soul' was away the body lay still, without moving, without life. When the 'soul' came back motion began again, and life. 'Soul' was the basis, the explanation, then, of motion as well as of life and breath; and where these were, there also must be 'soul.' Here again there was no argument admissible. The thing was perfectly clear and simple, which only the perverse or wicked would doubt. There must be a 'soul' in the sun, in the boisterous, quick-flowing, treacherous stream, in the forest tree that moved its great arms so weirdly in the twilight, in the animals with their quaint half-human ways. Endless were the ramifications of a theory which, however devoid of the essential marks of a sound scientific hypothesis, underlies every variety of the speculations of the Upanishads. But\nlong before it had reached the stage in which we find it in the Upanishads, the theory had gone through a course of development shown, in its later results, in the Vedas themselves, more especially in the Rig and the Atharva Vedas. The souls supposed to preside over the powers of nature had become gods. And as the feelings of awe or terror, produced by those powers in men's minds, were wont to differ, so the degree of worship paid to the various beings supposed to animate them differed too. Certain of these gods at different times\u2014first the Mother Earth, then the Moon, then the Sun, for instance\u2014were regarded as in some sense superior to the rest. And the latest speculation before the time of the Upanishads, preserved in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and also in the last and latest book of the Rig Veda, arrived at the conception of a First Cause (though that expression is not used) out of whom all the gods, and all the human souls, were supposed to have proceeded.\n\nThese speculations (in which it should never be forgotten that 'God' is a corollary of 'soul') bear in many respects a very striking resemblance to early speculations in the West. And the reason of this is sufficiently obvious. The speculations in both cases were the result of the primitive reasoning of early thinkers in a similar stage of intellectual development; and were based in both cases on still older fallacies similar again, in their turn, since they arose from similar causes. It is for this reason that the forms in which such early thinking clothes itself follow in all cases (whether in Greece or India, in Egypt or China) an analogous order. The results reached are always, and inevitably, unreliable. For the methods followed were wholly inadequate. But they were the necessary preliminaries to any further steps in intellectual effort. And each of the different phases of this ancient speculation\u2014for in method and in similarity of result it is, after all, but one\u2014has an interest of its own, besides its especial interest from the comparative point of view; while the Indian phase of it is not only peculiarly rich in religious feeling and in poetic expression, but is also distinguished by its logical completeness.\nBut this logical completeness in the evolution of thought in India does not, unfortunately, involve completeness of exposition in detail. Just as in the West we find, for instance, the existence of a 'soul' inside the body taken for granted, and yet no clear statement as to how or when it came there, or whereabout in the body it dwells, or how and when it escapes, so in the Upanishads the hypothesis is never set out with clearness or fulness of detail, nor are the isolated statements or paragraphs worked out into any system. And the reason is simply that the hypothesis having been handed down from immemorial time, and being taken for granted as accepted by all, it was considered amply sufficient to refer to it in vague and indirect phraseology. As this hypothesis is the basis of the whole of the teaching of the Upanishads, it will be necessary, as a first step, to piece together these vague references in order to see what they do, and what they do not, presuppose.\n\nIn the living body, in its ordinary state, the soul dwells in the cavity of the heart.\\(^1\\) By this no special vacant space appears to be meant, but simply the interior of the heart. In the oldest texts\\(^2\\) the soul is described as being in size like a grain of barley or of rice, and in later texts\\(^3\\) as of the size of a thumb; and it is therefore called 'the dwarf.'\\(^4\\) It is in shape like a man,\\(^5\\) in appearance like a yellow robe, like smoke-coloured wool, like cochineal, like flame, like a white lotus, like a flash of lightning,\\(^6\\) or like a light without smoke.\\(^7\\) And it consists of consciousness, mind, the Vital Airs or Spirits (explained below), eye and ear, earth, water, air and ether, heat and no heat, desire and no desire, anger and no anger, law and no law; in a word, of all things.\\(^8\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Brhad., iv, 3. 7; v, 6: compare ii, 4. 11.

And in one obscure\\(^3\\) and curious old text\\(^4\\) we have four souls made respectively of Vital Spirit, mind, consciousness, and joy, each of them the same as, and yet different from, the former, and each of them of the shape of a man. This theory, which is already adumbrated in one or two passages in the older books,\\(^5\\) has become an integral part of the later Ved\u0101nta speculations under the name of the theory of the Koshas or 'sheaths.' But that word is not found, in this sense, in the old texts.\n\nIn dream sleep, however, the soul is away from the body.\n\n\"Therefore they say: 'Let no one wake a man brusquely; for that is a matter difficult to be cured for him if the soul find not its way back to him.'\"\\(^6\\)\n\nIt was no doubt also supposed to be away from the body during trance (as it is in certain diseases, Ait. \u0100r., iii, 2. 4. 7), but there is no mention of trance in the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads.\\(^7\\)\n\nDuring the dream the soul, leaving the body in charge of the Vital Spirits, wanders at its will, builds up a world according to its fancy, creates for itself chariots and horses, lakes and rivers, manifold shapes, a gorgeous playground, wherein it acts and enjoys and suffers, \"either rejoicing with women, or laughing with his friends, or beholding horrible sights.\"\\(^8\\) Till at last, tired out\u2014just as a falcon after roaming hither and thither in the sky, tired, flaps his wings, and is wafted to his nest\u2014the soul returns from that playground of his to the state where in deep fast sleep he wants no more, and dreams no more.\\(^9\\)\n\nThe dreams are unreal, built up of the memories of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) (Manas) Brhad., i. 4. 17; v. 6.\n\\(^2\\) (Vij\u00f1\u0101na) Brhad., ii. 1. 17; iii. 7. 22; iv. 3. 7; iv. 5. 13.\n\\(^3\\) Tait., ii. 2-5.\n\\(^4\\) Brhad., i. 5. 3; ii. 1. 17; iv. 3. 7; iv. 4. 5; Ch., 3. 15. 1, 3.\n\\(^5\\) Brhad., iv. 3. 14.\n\\(^6\\) Dhy\u0101na at Ch., vii. 6. 1 is perhaps ecstasy of meditation on one object only, but not trance, which is first mentioned in the Maitri Up., vi, 18-25.\n\\(^7\\) Brhad., iv. 3. 9-13; Ch., viii, 12. 3.\n\\(^8\\) Brhad., iv. 3. 19.\nthings the soul has experienced in the body,\\(^1\\) and independent of time and space and causality. But they are true so far as they are premonitory of good luck, or the reverse. So in an old verse preserved in the Ch\u0101ndogya (v, 2. 9) the sight of a woman betokens success, and in the Aitareya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka (iii, 2. 4. 17) there are ten different dreams stated to be certain signs of approaching death.\n\nDuring the dreamless, deep, sleep the soul pervades the whole body, to the very hairs and nails, by means of the 72,000 arteries called Hit\u0101 (the Good). As a young man or a great king having reached the summit of happiness might rest, so doth he then rest. And then no evil touches him, for he hath obtained light.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya Upanishad, one of the very latest included in the list given above at p. 72, and the shortest of them all, consists of only twelve verses, entirely devoted to this theory of the waking, dreaming, and sleeping states. It gives special names, not found in the older Upanishads, to these three states, and adds a fourth state called the Tur\u012bya ('fourth'), the state of the man who has reached salvation by realization of the fact that his soul is identical with God. This fourth state is only mentioned elsewhere in the closing words of the Maitri Upanishad, which is certainly post-Buddhistic, and the idea is possibly derived from the use of the word Tur\u012bya in a quite different sense and connection (as a name of part of the G\u0101yatr\u012b metre) in the older Brhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka.\\(^3\\)\n\nThere is no distinct statement in the Upanishads as to the time or the manner of the entrance of the 'soul' into the body\u2014whether at the moment of conception, or at the quickening of the child in the womb, or at the moment of birth. All views on this point were, no doubt, as hazy then in India as they are now in the West. But there are passages which show that the 'soul' was supposed to have\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Pra\u015bna, iv, 5.\n\n\\(^2\\) Brhad., ii, 1. 19; iv, 3. 20; Ch., viii, 6. 3; Kaush., iv, 19. Compare Brhad., i, 4. 7; Pra\u015bna, iii, 6; iv, 1-6; Katha, vi, 16.\n\n\\(^3\\) Brhad., v, 14. 3, 7. So two of the other names in the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya occur already (in a different sense) in the Ch\u0101ndogya, v, 12.\nexisted before birth in some other body,\\(^1\\) and to have been inserted at the origin of things into its first body downwards through the suture in the top of the skull into the heart,\\(^2\\) or, as one passage has it, through the tips of the feet upwards through the belly into the head.\\(^3\\) And there is a curious speculation, of which we have three variants, on the transfer of the soul by generation through the seed.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe length of a man's life on earth is predetermined.\\(^5\\) When he dies the soul leaves the body. But as to the manner in which it leaves it, and the place to which the soul goes, the statements are just as vague and contradictory as those as to the when and the how of the soul's entrance into the body.\n\nAccording to one statement of the Brhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka\\(^6\\) the soul at death goes into the ether, and nothing is left of the man save his Karma. But this doctrine is regarded as a great mystery not to be discussed in public, and the passage (however interesting as a partial anticipation of Buddhism) stands quite isolated, and has been overshadowed in the later Upanishads by another and entirely contradictory doctrine found in another passage of the same work.\n\nThis is the well-known passage at vi, 2. 15, 16, which recurs almost word for word in two places in the Ch\u0101ndogya.\\(^7\\) According to this passage the souls of \"those who know this (a certain fivefold mystical interpretation of the sacrifice), and of those who in the forest follow faith and the truth, go\n\nat death to light;\nfrom light to day;\nfrom day to the bright half (of the month);\n\n\\(^1\\) Brhad., iii, 2. 13; iv, 4. 6; K\u0101\u1e6dha, v, 7 (compare vi, 4, and Ait. \u0100r., 2. 3. 2).\n\\(^2\\) Tait., i, 6. 1; Ait., 3. 12.\n\\(^3\\) Ait. \u0100ra\u1e47yaka, 2. 1. 4. 1\u20138.\n\\(^4\\) Brhad., vi, 3. 16; Kaush., i, 2; Ait., ii, 1\u20134.

And when that is over they come back to this ether,\\(^1\\) thence to the air, thence to the rain, thence to the earth. When they have reached the earth they become food, and are again offered in the altar-fire which is the male\\(^2\\) (that is, men eat them). Then they are born on the altar-fire which is woman (that is, women conceive them).\\(^3\\) Thus, passing from world to world, do they transmigrate.\n\n\\(^1\\) It is probably only as a parallel to this mention of the ether that the Ch\u0101ndogya inserts ether also in the last list.\n\\(^2\\) This is one of the fivefold mystic explanations of the sacrifice (Brhad., vi, 2, 12 = Ch\u0101ndogya, v, 7).\n\\(^3\\) That souls pass from man to woman in seed is often referred to elsewhere: Brhad., v, 6. 2; Kaush., 1. 2; Ait., 4; Ait. \u0100r., iii, 2. 2. 4.\n\"Those, however, who do not know (either of) these ways, (they become) worms, moths, and gnats.\"\n\nThis is, as a theory, perfectly simple, and holds well together. Those who know the mystic, euhemeristic interpretation of the sacrifice go through light and the Deva-loka to the sun and to an immortal life in the Brahma world. Those who do not know it, but are good men and do penance, go through the night and the world of the dead to the moon, and thence return through rebirth to this world. But the bad become insects.\n\nThe Ch\u0101ndogya spoils the symmetry of this theory by sending 'those who know' also to the moon, and by putting with them (not in the second company) those who do penance. And again, at the end, by dividing the second company (who, on its own hypothesis, are good) into good and bad, and then giving the good a rebirth into the higher castes and the bad a rebirth into animals or outcasts. Finally, it winds up with a kind of protest against the Brhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka by saying that the insects form a class by themselves with which the previously mentioned men, either good or bad, have nothing to do.\u00b9\n\nThere is yet a third theory in the same book, but inconsistent with each of the foregoing. According to this\u00b2 the soul at death gathers into itself the Vital Spirits of all the senses; and (the top point of the heart having become lighted up) the soul, guided by that light, departs, taking with it the Vital Spirits, through the eye, to another body, exalted or not according to the deeds done in the body it has thus left. All this is true if the soul at death be full of craving. But if craving have ceased, then at death the soul, being Brahman, goes through the opening at the top of the skull\u00b3 to Brahman, obtains Brahman, and becomes immortal.\n\nIn the Kaushitaki, which is certainly later than the\n\n\u00b9 Compare Ch., vi, 9. 3; vi, 10. 2, on rebirth as animals.\n\u00b2 Brhad., iv, 4. 1-6; compare Pra\u015bna, i, 9-16; iii, 10. Kaush., iii, 3.\n\u00b3 Ch\u0101ndogya, viii, 6. 6; Ka\u1e6dha, vi, 16; Tait., i, 6. 1. Compare Pra\u015bna, 3. 6, 7.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nB\u1e5bhad., there is yet another theory.\u00b9 \"All who go forth from this world go even to the moon. It is by their spirits that the bright half of the moon waxes.\u00b2 In the time of the dark half it (the moon) sends them on to a new birth. This verily is the door of heaven; to wit, the moon. Him who answers it, it sends on higher. Him who answers it not, it rains down hither, and he is born again here either as worm, or grasshopper, or fish, or bird, or lion, or bear, or snake, or tiger, or man, or some other creature, according to his Karma, according to his knowledge.\" If, on being thus reborn, he gets to perceive the identity of himself and his teacher, then he goes on, through the worlds of Agni, V\u0101yu, Varu\u1e47a, Indra, and Praj\u0101pati, to the world of Brahm\u0101, which is described at length and with much eloquence. Five hundred maidens there receive him. His good Karma goes to his kindred, his bad to his enemies. Many are his difficulties and adventures before he at last comes to Brahm\u0101 himself, and having answered rightly all the questions put, then whatever victory, whatever power, belongs to Brahm\u0101, that he also wins.\n\nThe above theories are all that are set out with complete detail. But there are not a few isolated passages which presuppose other views really inconsistent with any of these, though often made up of a mixture of them. Thus the Taittiriya gives an account,\u00b3 according to which the soul makes its way out through the head, where the roots of the hair divide. Thence it goes to Agni, V\u0101yu, \u0100ditya (fire, wind, sun), and finally to Brahman. There it attains to lordship, having reached the lord of the mind, and becomes lord of speech, sight, hearing, and knowledge. This has clear analogies to the last theory, but it is not the same.\n\nThe Mundaka Upanishad says that those who think sacrifice and pious deeds are the best are befooled, knowing\n\n\u00b9 Kaushitaki, i, 2.\n\u00b2 So the rays of the sun in one passage of the S\u0101tapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a (i, 9. 3. 10), and the stars of heaven in another (vi, 5. 4. 8), had already been identified with the souls of the righteous.\n\u00b3 Tait., 1. 6 (ii, 8 is only about abandoning the world, in the sense of becoming a recluse).\nnot the other things that are better; and when in heaven's heights they have enjoyed the fruit of their good works, they return to this lower world. But those who practise penance and faith in the forest go through the door of the sun to where that immortal Person is whose soul passeth not away.\\(^1\\) This is taken from the Ch\u0101ndogya variation of the second theory in the B\u1e5bhad.\n\nThe Katha Upanishad says that fire sacrifice leads to heaven, and they who go there enter the immortal state,\\(^2\\) having overcome rebirth and death.\\(^3\\) But in another passage it says that he who has mind and intelligence, and is pure, reaches the place whence he is not born again; whereas he who has not, and is impure, goes into transmigration.\\(^4\\) Yet, again, it says that some enter the womb and have (living) bodies, but others enter blocks of wood (things that don't move) according to their works and their learning.\\(^5\\) But when all the bonds of the heart are broken, then the mortal becomes immortal, moving upwards by the artery that passes into the crown of the head.\\(^6\\)\n\nThe \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara says that those who know the universal spirit become immortal,\\(^7\\) but the others transmigrate into various bodies.\\(^8\\)\n\nThe author of the Pra\u015bna Upanishad, short as it is, contrives with reckless boldness to give five different views of what happens to the soul after it leaves the body.\n\na.\\(^9\\) Those who trust to sacrifice and pious works are reborn into the world of the moon, and thence return (to this world); but those who have sought the soul by penance, faith, and knowledge gain the sun, the home of the spirits, the immortal, free from danger, the highest state.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mund., i. 2. 10, 11: compare iii, 2. 6, 7.\n\\(^2\\) Katha, i, 13.\n\\(^3\\) Ibid., i, 17.\n\\(^4\\) Ibid., iii, 7, 8.\n\\(^5\\) Ibid., v, 7.\n\\(^6\\) Ibid., vi, 15, 16: compare S'v\u0113t., i, 8.\n\\(^7\\) S'v\u0113t., i, 7; iii, 10; iv, 11\u201317; v, 14.\n\\(^8\\) S'v\u0113t., v, 7, 11, 12.\n\\(^9\\) Pra\u015bna, i, 9, 10.\n\u03b2. Those who observe the rule of Praj\u0101pati (a certain rule there set out of conjugal continence) produce a pair, and to them belongs the Brahma world; those in whom are penance and continence, in whom the truth is set firm, to them belongs the Brahma world.\n\n\u03b3. It is in the heart that the soul dwells. There there are 101 arteries, each hundredfold, and to each one belong 72,000 branch arteries, in which the Vy\u0101na (a mode of breathing or breath) moves. Through one of these arteries the Ud\u0101na (the up-breathing) leads it by the good it has done to a good world, by the evil it has done to an evil world, and by both to the world of men.\n\n\u03b4. Whatever a man\u2019s thought is (at the time of his death), with that thought he goes into his Vital Spirit, and the Spirit together with the bodily warmth leads him with his soul to the world he wishes for.\n\n\u03b5. If a man meditates till death on the first letter (only) of the word AUM (Om) he is quickly reborn in the world. It is the Rig Veda verses which lead him to the world of men, but if there he becomes gifted with penance, continence, and faith he achieves greatness. If he meditates on two letters he is quickly reborn in mind. The verses of the Yajur Veda lead him up to the sky. That is the world of Soma (the moon). He first enjoys glory there, and then comes back (to earth). If he meditates on all three letters, that is, on the Great Soul, he goes to light and to the sun. He is led by the verses of the S\u0101ma Veda to the world of Brahm\u0101.\n\nLastly, it is very remarkable that in the solemn words with which the Ch\u0101ndogya closes, and which are put in the mouth of Brahm\u0101 himself, it is said that he who has learnt the Vedas from a family of teachers according to rule in\n\n1 Pra\u015bna, i, 15, 16. Compare Ch\u0101ndogya viii, 4. 3.\n2 Ibid., iii, 6, 7.\n3 Ibid., iii, 10. Compare the obscure passage in the Ch\u0101ndogya Upanishad, iii, 5\u201310, where the soul becomes in succession one of different sets of gods whose colour he has understood.\n4 Ibid., v, 3\u20135.\n5 Ch\u0101ndogya, viii, 15.\n6 Just as the contrary doctrine is in Ch\u0101ndogya, iii, 11. 4.\nthe growing moral sense of the people brought about an inevitable revolt.\n\nAs is well known,\u00b9 the Vedic position is the simple one, closely allied to the beliefs held by all Indo-European peoples, that the souls of the good go to heaven, where, in new and glorified bodies, they enjoy a life of sensuous pleasure (very much like that of the happy upon earth) with the fathers and with the gods; while the bad are cast into the darkness or into the pit. There is nothing here about transmigration, and no stress is laid especially upon sacrifice. It is in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as that the efficacy of sacrifice as a means of gaining heaven is put into the foreground in numerous passages\u00b2; and there is once reference in an old verse quoted by the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a,\u00b3 to the efficacy of knowledge as leading men to that condition in which desires have passed away. A similar idea is once or twice met with in different forms in other Br\u0101hma\u1e47as,\u2074 so that it must already at an early date have gained somewhat wide circulation in the circles of the Brahmins. Finally, the Brahma-loka, the world of Brahm\u0101, is mentioned once in the Atharva Veda, and one obscure passage in the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2075 says that fire, wind, water, moon, lightning, and sun are six doors of, or to, Brahm\u0101. He who sacrifices with a burnt-offering arrives by Agni (fire), as the door, to Brahm\u0101; and is born into union with Brahm\u0101, into the same world as he is in. In another passage,\u2076 he who reads the Vedas in a particular way attains to oneness of soul with Brahm\u0101.\n\nWho can doubt that the similar speculations in the Upanishads are the outcome of these; that their variety is due to the variety of their sources; and that their greater clearness is at least partly due to the greater lapse\n\n\u00b9 The authorities are quoted by Muir, \"Sanskrit Texts,\" v, 284-313, and by Zimmer, \"Alt-Indisches Leben,\" 408-422.\n\u00b2 See the passages quoted by Professor Weber in the Z.D.M.G., ix, 237 foll., and by Muir, loc. cit., 314 foll.\n\u00b3 \u015aatap.

The modifications which we find in the Upanishads are also partly due to another very interesting cause\u2014to the influence of the laity.\n\nThe Br\u0101hma\u1e47as are exclusively the work of the priestly caste of the Brahmins. The Upanishads, as we have them, are no doubt also put together by the Brahmins. But they acknowledge (more especially as regards what is considered the highest teaching of the Upanishads) the co-operation and even guidance of the more thoughtful of the laity. The point is of so much importance for the history of thought in India, and particularly of Buddhism, but another article would be necessary to deal with it at suitable length.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 See Professor Garbe's article in \"Nord und Sud,\" 1893, \"Die Weisheit des Brahmanen oder des Kshatriya?\"; and Muir, \"Sanskrit Texte,\" vol. iv.\nART. V.\u2014Cave Drawings in the Kaim\u00fbr Range, North-West Provinces. By John Cockburn.\n\n[The following paper has been forwarded to us by Mr. Vincent Smith, who has kindly added a few notes.\u2014R.H. D.]\n\nPrevious Researches.\n\nThese drawings were first brought to notice by the late Mr. Archibald Carlleyle and myself, and were discovered by us independently of each other in 1880, he working in Rewah and Mirzapur and I in Banda. I took up the subject from the anthropological and zoological side entirely, Mr. Carlleyle from the antiquarian or philological side. He evidently had made some important discoveries of ancient records, but, as he desired to work them himself, he imparted no information on either the nature or the localities of his discoveries, and his knowledge has died with him.\u00b9 The first scientific paper on the drawings was by myself published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1883, and was entitled \u201cOn the recent existence of Rhinoceros Indicus in the North-West Provinces, and a description of an archaic rock painting from Mirzapur, representing the hunting of this animal\u201d (Journ., lii, part 2, 1883, pp. 56 to 64, with two plates).\u00b2 This article excited much interest\n\n\u00b9 \u201cNotes on lately discovered sepulchral mounds, cairns, caves, cave paintings, and stone implements. By A. C. Carlleyle, First Assistant, Archaeological Survey of India. In this paper Mr. Carlleyle enumerates all discoveries of interest lately made by him in the district of Mirzapur, and then gives a general account of his discoveries in Berghelkhand, Bundelkhand, and other places during the last nine years. This paper will be published in the Journal, Pt. I, 1883.\u201d (Proc. A.S.B., Feb., 1883, p. 49.) Unfortunately, the paper never appeared (V.A.S.).\n\n\u00b2 Abstract in Proc. A.S.B. for 1883, p. 123. (V. A. S.)\nin Europe, and great things were expected from the discovery. I regret that I have no copy of the paper. A short paragraph is also devoted to the subject in the Gazetteer of Mirzapur. There is a further paper in the Proc. Asiatic Society, Bengal, for 1884,\u00b9 on the durability of haematite drawings on sandstone rocks, by myself also. Shortly afterwards Mr. A. M. Markham, C.S., noticed a few words written in this pigment in ancient characters\u00b2 at Chacha Koond, or the Falls of the Tons in Rewah. Mr. Beglar, of the Archaeological Survey, also noticed extensive records in this pigment at the Chitlekna rock, Ramgarh, in Sirguja State, Chutia Nagpur, and attributed the writing to the seventh century.\u00b3 Then came the discovery of a dated record in this pigment at Gingi Hill, an islet of British territory belonging to Allahabad, but situated in Rewah. I paid a visit to this spot for the express purpose of noting in what state of preservation the writing was, and found it faint, but yet perfectly distinct and readable.\u2074 I have seen older writing. The position of this record shows how extremely difficult it is to find pictorial records. It is situated at the base of the hill, which has here perpendicular sides, and the writing is about five feet from the ground, and very inconspicuous. This record is nearly 1,900 years old, and it seems likely from what has been observed in the interior of the Great Pyramid by Dr. Flinders Petrie that the pigment laid on rock lasts 4,000 years in sheltered situations. This gentleman found that the lines drawn in ruddle for dressing and facing the blocks in the interior of the Great Pyramid looked as fresh as if they had been done a few days before; and as the climate of the North-West Provinces resembles Egypt somewhat,\u2075 and as many of the drawings are in rock shelters\n\n\u00b9 Proc. A.S.B. for 1884, p. 141. See also ibid. for 1883, p. 125. (V. A. S.)\n\u00b2 I cannot find any record of this discovery. (V. A. S.)\n\u00b3 Cunningham, Arch. Survey Reports, vol. xiii, pp. 34-41, pl. x. (V. A. S.)\n\u2074 Cunningham, Arch. Survey Reports, xxi, p. 119, pl. xxx. The date is the year 52, probably equivalent to the beginning of the Christian era. The record relates to a Maharaja Bhima Sena. (V. A. S.)\n\u2075 The resemblance is not very close. (V. A. S.)\nor caves, only open on one side, they are perfectly protected from the weather, and might last just as long.\n\nThese paintings and petroglyphs, or rock writing, must, therefore, be considered among the most ancient records in India; some of them, in all probability, being earlier than the earliest of records graven on stone or copper,\\(^1\\) and their importance can hardly be overestimated, particularly as some of the writing is in a character that looks like Mongol or T\u00fcrki, and, when regarded in connection with the discoveries now being made in the buried cities of Central Asia, the supposed home of the early Aryans, may possibly throw light on the Aryan invasion of India.\\(^2\\)\n\nSimilar drawings in the identical pigment occur in Australia and in South Africa, where they were done by the Bushmen, in North America, as described by Catlin, and in South America as described by Alfred Wallace. The concentric circles, yet considered by the natives of the Amazons as symbols of the sun and moon, are very common in Indian caves. But the most remarkable feature about them is their close similarity to modern savage Australian drawings done on bark. (See Brough Smith, \"The Aborigines of Victoria.\") The conventional method of representing the stone chip spear or 'gidjee,' the stone knife, boomerang, and the attitudes of the corroboree dance, are identical. There is also a close similarity in other points. The Australian drawings which have been explained by aborigines to Englishmen are a valuable key to the Indian paintings.\n\nA great antiquity is generally ascribed to this class of drawings, but they continue to be made to the present day, particularly in India, where the painting, done in red pigment on the front of a house where a marriage has occurred, and called Kohobur, passes imperceptibly into the cave drawing, some of the conventional forms of animals, birds, and inanimate objects being identical. It is therefore\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Cockburn's estimate of the antiquity of these documents may prove to be exaggerated. (V. A. S.)\n\n\\(^2\\) This result is, I should think, very unlikely. (V. A. S.)\njust possible that the drawings in these caves would afford as complete a pictorial record of the history of antiquity down to modern times as a volume of *The Graphic* does of the civilization of the present day, and they will certainly yield as much as, if not more information than, the sculptures of the Bharhut railing.\n\n**Position of the Drawings.**\n\nThe drawings are executed on vertical rocks, and in caves known as rock shelters. The accompanying sketch will give an idea of a section of a typical rock shelter: the drawings are done on the surface A, which is generally from four to ten feet high, and presents a very smooth and almost imperishable surface of vitreous quartzite. But many of them are on vertical rocks. Overhanging boulders, and the curious deep canyons, or gorges, formed by streams that cut their way through the Vindhyan plateaux, are favourite localities.\n\nThe Chunderpurba and Karamnasa rivers are cases in point. The drawings occur on both the northern and southern scarps of the Kymores, and also on the plateau between,\nwhich is from twenty to thirty miles wide; thus I have seen them near Mirzapur and Chunar, at Pahosa, and at Chitrakot, where a typical rock shelter with ancient drawings has had a series of modern stone steps several hundred feet high built up to it. The best of the rock shelters and drawings, in my opinion, are to be found on the southern scarp of the Kymores, which overhangs the valley of the Sone. The above sketch shows the position and probable way in which these rock shelters of the Kymore scarp have been formed. The stratum A being of great hardness endures, while the material of the cave C was crushed, or broke away at right angles to B, and was removed by denudation. The surface D is generally vertical, being cleanly fractured transverse to the bedding, and is an admirable material to draw on. There was but little soil in this cave. The Likhunia shelter overlooks Tuppeh Chourasi in the valley of the Sone, perhaps the finest bit of scenery in the Mirzapur District. I have hardly devoted more than a couple of weeks in all to their examination, and only in my spare time. Many of them are in exceedingly dangerous positions, necessitating crawling down the face of a precipice on the hands and knees; but most of these nearly inaccessible caves, if there is any earth on the floor, form veritable museums of prehistoric antiquities in the way of flint knives, cores, arrow-heads, celts, fragments of fossil and charred bone, pottery, etc. From this source alone I am confident I could make a fine collection, sets from which might be sent to every museum in the world, after meeting our own wants. Colonel Rivett-Carnac, assisted by me, has already presented sets of the larger stone implements to every museum in the world.\u00b9 It must not be supposed that every cave contains\n\n\u00b9 \"On Stone Implements from the North-Western Provinces of India. By J. H. Rivett-Carnac, Esq., C.S., C.I.E., F.S.A., etc.\" (J.A.S.B., vol. lii, pt. 1, p. 221, 1883.) This excellent account, illustrated by three good plates, describes the larger stone implements, hammers, ringstones, and celts collected by Messrs. Rivett-Carnac and Cockburn in the course of several years. A promised supplementary paper by Mr. Cockburn on the smaller chert implements does not seem to have been published. (V. A. S.)\ninteresting drawings, or records, or implements, and it must also be understood that very often miles of the Kymores prove to possess no caves at all, or the caves prove to have only a few trivial drawings of a very rude and conventional character in them. Thus, near Markandi and Majhgawan in the Banda District, after a laborious search, I only found two sets of drawings, and the most interesting of these was perfectly inaccessible, as it was on the face of a scarp 100 feet high, and the floor had dropped off. As a matter of fact, rock shelters sufficiently durable to contain drawings only occur in certain localities where the upper strata of the Kymore sandstone have been fused to a very considerable degree of hardness. In the strata known geologically as the Rewah formation they hardly occur, and I only know one good cave in the south of Pargana Khairagarh of the Allahabad District, near Atrazee [sic], where this formation occurs.\n\nThe height of the hills is no criterion, but rather their hardness.\n\nPetroglyphs occur everywhere. I have chiefly seen them about Bijaygarh in South Mirzapur: one particularly fine record in perfect preservation was seen by me at Ek Powah Ghat near the gorge of the Ghaghur, near Robertsganj in South Mirzapur. Each letter was about two inches long, and the strokes were a quarter of an inch thick. There were about six lines of about four feet in length, if I remember right. The character was some early form of Hindi. The shell-writing occurs everywhere, and much of it is of very large size, each letter being a foot long, and the record extending for fifteen or twenty feet.\u00b9 Words in Asoka characters are common in many of these caves. There can be no doubt that they have been inhabited first by savages, and then by Buddhist and Hindu hermits, from the earliest times to the present day, when holy men from Benares occasionally take up their residence in them, many of the\n\n\u00b9 See Cunningham, Arch.

I am certain that a considerable mass of rock-writing will be discovered in the course of a general search, but a search for writing alone would not be very remunerative.\n\nNature of Drawings.\n\nThe more ancient drawings are often very elaborate and exhibit considerable skill, as will be seen by a reference to the plate of the rhinoceros hunt, which covered about a square yard of rock. The drawing is executed with a degree of boldness and accuracy as regards zoological detail quite beyond the natives of India at the present day. The position of the man tossed by the rhinoceros, sprawling in the air, is ridiculously like a picture in Baldwin's \"African Hunting.\" Drawings as large depicting other scenes occur, and a good deal of information may be got out of them. For example, a river scene shows the character of the boat used, and the species of huge fish harpooned is recognizable at a glance. The reels holding the harpoon line are very similar to those used in parts of Africa at the present day.\n\nSome of the drawings of animals are of a high standard of merit. One drawing of a stag, chital (spotted deer), with his head turned round, is quite up to a modern drawing, and certainly better than I could draw the animal myself.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 I have not seen the tracing of this drawing. Tracings of three drawings are enclosed. (V. A. S.)\n\nFig. 1. Man spearing Gonr stag (*Rucervus Duvaucelii*). From Bhalduria, Pargana Ahaura, Mirzapur. The animal has an arrow stuck in the throat, and was also shown as attacked by dogs. The spear-head, while very like those made of hoop-iron used by the modern Andamanese for spearing dugong, may possibly have been of stone, though the probabilities are in favour of iron or copper. The Gonr is locally extinct, but is yet found in small numbers 200 miles south.\n\nFig. 2. Man with a torch encountering a panther at night. From Lohri Cave.\n\nFig. 3. Man spearing sambhar hind with stone spear. The object in front is probably a leaf screen, such as Indian shikarris set use in stalking game. The conventional form of representing the head and barbs of the spear is exactly similar to that used by the modern Australian aborigines in representing their stone spears on bark and in cave drawings. From Likhunia Cave.\nIndividual abnormalities in the antlers of deer are often represented, and I came across an injured drawing of a two-horned rhinoceros. Weapons, utensils, and totems are very accurately figured. Pigments of various colours have been used. I have seen traces of white, black, and yellow, but the chief pigment is ruddle, or red oxide of iron, which occurs in a very pure form in these hills, pencils and lumps of it being found in the soil of the caves. The pigment was probably rubbed up with animal fat, and I have succeeded in reproducing it perfectly, and left my name at various spots with a date, fourteen years ago. It would be interesting to know in what state of preservation this writing is now. Wallace, in his \"Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro,\" mentions finding the names of Spaniards who had visited picture drawings a century before, in perfect preservation, they being done with the same pigment, red oxide of iron, which was also the favourite war-paint of the North American Indian. Indeed, the Indian equestrian cave portraits resemble the American reproductions of Catlin very closely, though the latter cannot possibly be more than three centuries old, for horses were introduced by the Spaniards. This pigment was laid on pretty thick, and perfectly preserved paintings bear much resemblance to the red paintings on the outside of mummy cases. I have shown in one of my papers how this oxide of iron communicates a stain to the rock\u2014a stain that is evidently capable of lasting thousands of years; but, unfortunately, many causes are at work destroying the drawings, and not a monsoon can pass without some of them being destroyed.\n\nThe chief causes of destruction are natural ones. The roofs of a considerable number of the shelters project many feet in the form of a thick slab, and these very frequently give way when saturated by rain, thus closing the shelter. Then, again, the water that oozes through the strata of the sandstone is charged with carbonate of lime, and leaves a thin white deposit of stalactite over the drawings, completely obliterating them. Smoke made by fires of\nART. VI.\u2014M\u0101ham Anaga. By H. BEVERIDGE.\n\nThis lady was one of Akbar's nurses, and is said to have watched over him from the cradle to the throne. She must have been a notable woman, for she acquired great influence over Akbar, and was for a time the administratrix of his kingdom. It was in great measure through her intrigues that Akbar emancipated himself from the control of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n. There has long been a mystery about her status and about the paternity of her children. She had two sons, B\u0101q\u012b Kh\u0101n K\u014dka and Adham Kh\u0101n K\u014dka, but their father's name is never mentioned. Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl, Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, Bad\u0101oni, and other writers, always speak of them as the sons of M\u0101ham Anaga, but give no hint as to their father's identity. Hence Mr. Blochmann concluded that Adham Kh\u0101n, the more celebrated of the two, was \"doubtless a royal bastard.\" Professor Dowson demurs to this view on account of the great respect with which M\u0101ham Anaga is always spoken of, but admits that there is a mystery about the paternity. If, however, an illuminated MS. in the possession of Colonel Hanna is to be trusted, the mystery is cleared up, for its author states that M\u0101ham Anaga was the wife of Nadim Khw\u0101ja K\u014dka, the sherbet-provider (sharbat-bard\u0101r) or butler of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. The statement occurs at p. 9b of the MS., in telling the story (also given in the Akbarn\u0101ma) of how Akbar, while still an infant, comforted his nurse Jiji Anaga. M\u0101ham Anaga and the other nurses were, it seems, jealous of Akbar's predilection for Jiji, and accused her to Hum\u0101y\u016bn of practising enchantments so as to make the young prince refuse all milk but her own. Jiji was very sad about this, and one evening when she was alone with the child, the latter, while yet in the cradle, opened\nhis Messiah-like mouth and bade her be of good cheer, for she would always have the exclusive nursing of him. The statement about M\u0101ham Anaga's being the wife of Nad\u012bm is quite clear, and Nad\u012bm is a perfectly possible husband for her, for he seems to have been a foster-brother of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and he is frequently mentioned by Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl, Jauhar and others, as a faithful follower of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's fortunes. It is true that Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl, in his account of Akbar's nurses, speaks of Nad\u012bm K\u014dka's wife as Fakhru-n-niss\u0101, but this may have been another name for M\u0101ham, and the author of Colonel Hanna's MS. uses both names as if they belonged to the same person. Moreover, Gulbadan Begum, who is presumably a better authority than either of them, calls Fakhru-n-niss\u0101 the mother, and not the wife, of Nad\u012bm. The main question is\u2014Is the author of Colonel Hanna's MS. a sufficient authority for the statement that Nad\u012bm was M\u0101ham Anaga's husband? Colonel Hanna has kindly allowed me to examine the MS., and I have read as much of it as I could in two days. On the flyleaf the MS. is said to be the composition of two ladies\u2014Shukru-n-nissa, a daughter of Akbar (afterwards married to Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh), and her sister-in-law \u1e24ab\u012bba B\u0101n\u016b, daughter of \u2018Az\u012bz K\u014dka and wife of Prince Mur\u0101d. But I was unable to find in the MS. any reference to a dual authorship, or to its being the work of a lady. The author speaks of himself as a grandson of \u2018Az\u012bz K\u014dka, and was consequently a great-grandson of Akbar's nurse J\u012bj\u012b Anaga. He wrote apparently in the time of Jah\u0101ng\u012br. Some of his statements are not accurate, but he seems to have had good sources of information, for he quotes the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Atka Kh\u0101n, which seems to have been written by Nawab Shar\u012bf Kh\u0101n, a son (?) of the Atka Kh\u0101n (Shamsu-d-d\u012bn), and which appears to be now lost. As a descendant, too, of J\u012bj\u012b Anaga, I think he may be trusted about a fact connected with her. Unfortunately, the preface to the first part of the MS. is wanting. What is prefixed to the beginning is a fragment of the introduction to the second part. Hence we have not the author's account\nof the work. I conjecture, however, that he was a teacher employed in the royal court and that he wrote his book for the instruction of some young prince. Perhaps this explains the curiously rude and childish form of the pictures in the book. Colonel Hanna is inclined to think them the productions of the above-named two young ladies, but it seems to me more probable that they are sketches made by a M\u00fcnshi for the instruction and amusement of a child.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The words used at p. 96 of the MS. are M\u0101ham Anaga zan-i-Nadim Khw\u0101ja. Nadim is not called K\u014dka, but he can hardly be a different person from the Nadim K\u014dka of Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl. At p. 9a he is called Nadim Khw\u0101ja, sharbat-bardar. On the same page, we are told that Jiji Anaga was also called Sultanam, and that she belonged to the family of Amir Sayyid 'Abdu-l-lah Al Farid (r). That Nadim was a man of some position is shown by the statement in the Akbarn\u0101ma (Bib. Ind., i, 241) that he was one of Humayun's most trusty servants, and that he was put in charge of Mirz\u0101 'Askari when the latter was recaptured after his flight from Qandah\u0101r (A.D. 1545).\nART.

One \u0161ar (is the measure of) the temple of his god\u2014he has dedicated it for his life. Pi-\u0161a-\u0160ama\u0161 is the priest of the temple. N\u016br-il\u012b-\u0161u shall not make a claim against the priesthood (i.e., demand the restitution of the property he has given). The curse of the Sun-god and Suma-\u012bla (shall be upon him) who brings an action.\n\nThis interesting document is drawn up in accordance with the desire for strict legality that seems to have been so firmly fixed in the Babylonian mind, and from that very circumstance, forms a remarkable contrast with the illegal, and, in fact, lawless account given in Judges xvii of the dedication of a priest and images (and, it may also be presumed, a temple) for religious (heathen) worship. The existence of prohibitions against claiming back property that had been sold or given are so common in Babylonian contracts, that one can hardly help believing that the people were very prone to giving, and even to selling, things that they afterwards, in a moment of repentance, proceeded to claim as their own again.\n\nLines 1, 2. Lugala and \u0160ullat (instead of Lugala we may read \u0160arru)\nare apparently names of Marduk or Merodach as \"the King,\" and Zir-panitum, his consort, as \"the Bride,\" though the latter rendering is doubtful. If, however, the translation here suggested be correct, the meaning (bride) probably arose from the custom of carrying off a maiden from her father's house. The root is probably \u0161al\u0101lu, 'to carry off (as spoil).\u2019 The absence of case-ending to the name \u0160ullat is noteworthy.\n\nLine 5. \"For his god.\" As the form tli, oblique case of tl\u016b, could hardly have been plural at this early date, the temple would seem to have been built for Merodach alone, and it may be surmised that the consort of the god was included \"by courtesy\" (so to say) only.\n\nLine 11. \u0160agum is apparently the word that appears in the syllabaries of later date as \u0161ang\u016b, 'priest.' The abstract noun from this, \u0161agutim (oblique case), later \u0161angutim, occurs in line 13.\u00b9\n\nLines 15, 16. \u1e2aI (?), \u1e2aI (?) \u1e62W \u1e62I \u1e2aI \u1e2aI \u1e2aI \u1e2aI. The first two characters are doubtful, but they seem, from the traces, to be li and mu, which would make the word limun, construct case of limu, 'evil,' here equivalent, apparently, to the word 'curse.' That limun \u0160ama\u0161, 'evil of the Sun-god,' is a proper name, is doubtful, and even improbable. On the other hand, Suma-tla would seem to be a royal name, coupled, as is usual, with that of the god, to bring down a curse on the contractor, in the case that he should break his solemn word here given. Suma-tla (the text has Zuma-ila) may possibly be the same as Sumu-ia-ila, the second ruler of the dynasty of Babylon (that to which Hammurabi or Amraphel belongs). The completing words in this line seem to be those that the sense requires.\n\nIn the list of witnesses, all the names are Semitic except Aba-Ellila-kime ('who is like the god Bel?'), father of Sin-rab\u00fb, and Lu-Ninsah ('man' or 'servant of the deity Ninsah'), father of the first of the two witnesses named\n\n\u00b9 The root is apparently the Akkadian sagga, 'head.'\nSin-idinna\u0161\u0161u. Another possible reading of the name A\u1e2bum-\u1e2bibum is A\u1e2bum-t\u0101bum, 'the good brother.'\n\nBu. 91\u20135\u20139, 407.\n\nWedding Contract.\n\nD.P.

Innab\u0101tum, her mother, has given her in marriage to Zukania. Should Zukania forsake her, he shall pay one *mana* of silver. Should A\u1e25u-ayabi deny him, he may throw her down from the tower.

In the J.R.A.S. for 1897, p. 605, there is a similar phrase in the nature of a declaration, wherein is stated that no person had anything against the bride that was to be.\n\nThe punishment for unfaithfulness seems to be the same as that decreed on p. 607 of the same volume, where death by being thrown down from the tower (probably the highest portion of one of those towers in stages that were to be found in most of the great cities of Babylonia) is spoken of. If this be the case, \\( \\text{i\u0161-tu AN-ZAG} \\) (?)-GAR-KI, would seem to be equivalent to \\( \\text{i\u0161-tu di-im-tim} \\), of the present\ntext. Cf. Delitzsch, Handw\u00f6rterbuch, p. 221. An alternative method of execution was by throwing the offending wife into the river (J.R.A.S. for 1897, p. 610, and the well-known tablet of Akkadian laws).\n\nThe clause decreeing that A\u1e2b\u1e2bu-ayabi is to support Innab\u0101tum would seem, from a comparison of parallel passages, to be due to the latter having handed all her property to her stepdaughter on the occasion of her marriage, though this fact is not stated in the record of the deed.\n\nThat A\u1e2b\u1e2bu-ayabi was not the real, but the adopted daughter of Innab\u0101tum, is implied by a comparison of this text with those translated on pp. 604 and 605 of the J.R.A.S. for July of last year, quoted above.\n\nBu. 91\u20135\u20139, 419.\n\nConcerning an alleged Runaway Slave.\n\nD.P. \u0100rad-D.P.

Sin-mu\u0161alim and Marduk-lamaza, overseers, recognized \u00c2rad-Bunene, and said to him thus: \u201cThy bright armlet has a mark (like that of a slave)\u2014thou must go among the temple-servants (?).\u201d \u00c2rad-Bunene answered thus: \u201cI will not go among the temple-servants (?). I am doing the business of the house of my father.\u201d Libit-Addi, Addu-luzirum, and Ibni-\u0160ama\u0161, his brothers, swore by Merodach and Ammi-\u1e6ditana the king to \u00c2rad-Bunene, their brother, that he should not be claimed to go into slavery\u2014as long as he lives, he is to do, with his brothers, the business of the house of his father.\n\n(Here follow the names of the two witnesses, and the date.)\nLine 2. As the characters \u1e2ba are written rather close together, the question naturally arises whether they may not have here another value than that usually attributed to them. This being the case, the reading of the name Tam\u1e2bi-il\u012b-\u0161u must be regarded as being possibly provisional.\n\nLine 6. \u1e2ba il-li-ik-ma. This phrase receives, apparently, illustration from lines 18, 19 and 28, 29, where we have ilka \u0161a b\u0113t abi-ia allak and ilik b\u0113t abi-\u0161u illak: \u201cI am going the way of the house of my father\u201d and \u201che is going the way of the house of his father.\u201d Ilka al\u0101ku would therefore seem to mean \u2018to go about the business\u2019 of someone, and b\u0113lutam al\u0101ku ought, therefore, to mean \u2018to go under domination,\u2019 i.e. \u2018to serve a master.\u2019\n\nLine 8. The transcription of the characters \u1e63\u016b \u1e63\u016b \u1e63\u016b \u1e63\u016b (\u0113li ugar\u0113) is very doubtful\u2014in fact, it must be regarded as being merely provisional. The translation is, of course, equally so.\n\nLine 9. iz-su-u-ma. The meaning of this word seems to be clearly indicated by the context. As to the root, that is, in all probability, naz\u016b, connected, perhaps, with naz\u0101zu, in its meaning of \u2018to witness.\u2019 Indeed, naz\u016b will probably be found to account for some of the irregularities of the verb naz\u0101zu, as tabulated in Delitzsch\u2019s Handw\u00f6rterbuch.\n\nLine 12. el-li-ta ab-bu-ut-ta-ka. Another difficult phrase. According to Delitzsch, abbuttu means \u2018a kind of fetter,\u2019 but from this passage it would seem to have been an armlet or wristlet. If this be the case, ellita must be the adjective qualifying it, though adjectives preceding the noun are comparatively rare.\n\nLine 13. gu-ul-lu-ba-at. This must be the 3rd person fem. sing. of the permansive pu\u2019ul gullubu, from the root gal\u0101bu. Gullubu is generally rendered \u2018to cut,\u2019 \u2018to cut off,\u2019 especially of the hair. If, however, abbuttu have the meaning of \u2018fetter\u2019 or \u2018armlet,\u2019 gullubu\nmust also signify 'to cut in,' 'to engrave,' and 'to provide with a distinctive mark.'\n\nLine 16. \\( \\text{um} \\), seems to be written here, by mistake, for \\( \\text{um-ma} \\), as in line 11.\n\nLine 21. Note the plural \\( \\text{\u0101\u1e2bu} \\), 'brothers,' here, and \\( \\text{\u0101\u1e2bi} \\) (oblique case after \\( \\text{itti} \\)) in line 27. The singular occurs in line 24, and has only one \\( \\text{\u0101\u1e2bi-\u0161unu} \\), 'their brother').\n\nLines 22, 23. MU AMARUDUK U AMMI-TITANA LUGALE INPADDEWES. This is the usual oath-formula found in these texts, and indicates, from its position, that it is equivalent to the English idiom \"they swore by Merodach and Ammi-titana the king to \u0100rad-Bunene, their brother, that he should not be claimed as a slave.\"\n\nThe word \\( \\text{ri-su-tu} \\), is not from the noun \\( \\text{r\u0113\u0161u} \\), meaning 'head,' but from \\( \\text{r\u0113\u0161u} \\) 'servant,' which in Delitzsch's Handw\u00f6rterbuch is placed among the roots having \\( \\text{r} \\) as middle radical.\n\nBu. 91\u20135\u20139, 511.\n\nClaim and Judgment.\n\nD.P.

Marduk-mubali\u1e6d hired it, and a plantation of 5 \u0161ar was the amount he took and acquired. I have inhabited the smaller portion for fifty years. I said to him thus: \u201cPlease pay the rent.\u201d He did not pay the rent, and the house is a loss to me.

My lord, be thou severe. Merodach, who loves thee, formed thee to rule in righteousness.\n\nThis text being a difficult one, the above translation is given with all reserve, for many improvements in the rendering will undoubtedly be made when more is known concerning the language and manners and customs of the time to which it belongs. The fifty years mentioned in line 8 and the thirtieth year referred to in line 18 are, naturally, difficult to reconcile, though an explanation of this difficulty will probably be found before long. Certain words and expressions at present doubtful also obscure the meaning, as well as one or two slight breaks.\n\nThe transcription of \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 by ber\u00fbtu (lines 1, 6, 26) rests on the probability that the group is equivalent to \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, which was pronounced the same (ki-gala) in Akkadian, and was therefore a variant of it.\n\nItepu\u0161 in line 7 seems to come from the root \u00e9p\u0113\u0161u, which has the meaning of \u2018to acquire.\u2019 If this be the case, a new form (the secondary one of the kal) has to be registered in the dictionaries. The form hitherto met with is the pu\u2019ul, found in the Assyrian contract tablets.\n\nZuhar in line 8 is apparently the construct case of zuhar\u00fb, a word that seems to come from the root sal\u0101ru, \u2018to be small,\u2019 by the change of s into z.\n\nIn line 10 the verb \u2018said\u2019 is, as often happens in these texts, omitted. Gummer is apparently the imperative of the pu\u2019ul of the verb gam\u0101ru, \u2018to complete,\u2019 and has evidently here the meaning of \u2018be content,\u2019 equivalent to our word \u2018please.\u2019\n\nBARA-NITAH (line 14) would appear from this passage to designate a \u2018temple-servant.\u2019 The text Bu. 91\u20135\u20139, 419\n(see p. 109 ff.), seems to indicate that the temple-servants were escaped slaves whose masters could not be found.\n\nKinun in line 16 is apparently the terminationless form of kinunu, meaning, according to Delitzsch, 'chafing-dish' and 'censer.' I have regarded the form here used as being collective, but the singular may, nevertheless, be intended.\n\nKubbu (line 27) is apparently the imperative pu'ul of kab\u00fb, 'to speak,' and probably means 'to claim' or 'demand.'\n\nIzizza in line 33 seems to be from \u0113z\u0113zu, 'to be angry.' Izizza is probably for iziza, this again being for izz\u0101, the root-vowel being kept on account of the obscuration of the form that would otherwise have occurred by the bringing together of the two z's.\n\nNotwithstanding the many doubtful points in this text, the general sense of the whole may be regarded as being fairly certain. One peculiar thing about it is, that although it is addressed to some one who was the superior of the person making the complaint, there is not the usual dutiful introductory phrases that generally begin documents of this kind. This being the case, it is impossible to find out who the personage was who was appealed to.\n\nBu. 91\u20135\u20139, 2,474.\n\nClaim and Judgment.\n\nA-na i\u0161ten \u0101mtu ad-kal-\u0161i-im Concerning one slave, her handmaid (?),\n\u0161a A-ya-ti-ia um-ma-\u0161a which Ayatia, her mother,\n3. a-na \u1e2au-la-al-tim to \u1e2aulaltum, her daughter,\nm\u0101rti-\u0161a\ni-zi-bu-\u0161i-ma \u1e2au-la-al tum left her, and \u1e2aulaltum\n\nD.P.

After Ayatia died, Sin-na\u0161ir brought an action against \u1e2aulaltum on account of the maidservant, and Isarlim, scribe of the city of Sippar and recorder (?) of Sippar, caused them to receive judgment.

There is every probability that the word is Akkadian.\n\nIn line 9 the text seems to be corrupt, and the rendering \"there was no tablet\" is, therefore, provisional. Perhaps we ought to read, instead of \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 (?), um (or duppa) la ra-am, \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, um-ma la ra-ga-am, \"(saying) thus: '(There is to be) no going to law.'\"\n\nFrom this inscription it seems clear that, at the period to which it refers, Babylonian women had absolute control over their own property.

TATH\u0100GATA.\n\nMonsieur et Honor\u00e9 Secr\u00e9taire, \u2014 Permettez-moi d\u2019ajouter quelques mots \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit de la question d\u00e9battue dans notre Journal ; c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, du sens et de l\u2019\u00e9tymologie du mot tath\u0101gata.\n\nJe ne puis dire quelle signification les premiers bouddhistes attachaient \u00e0 ce terme, mais on peut hardiment affirmer ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pour eux au premier si\u00e8cle de notre \u00e8re.\n\nEn effet, lors de l\u2019introduction du bouddhisme en Chine, en l\u2019an 67 A.C., tath\u0101gata a \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en chinois par les deux mots zh\u014du l\u00e1i \u5982\u4f86, dont le premier signifie \u2018ainsi\u2019 et le second \u2018venir, venant,\u2019 ou \u2018venu.\u2019\n\nCons\u00e9quemment, pour les Indous bouddhistes de cette \u00e9poque tath\u0101gata \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 tatha \u0101gata, \u2018ainsi venu.\u2019 N\u2019est-il pas probable que c\u2019\u00e9tait son acception primitive ?\n\nMais en ce cas, que signifie ce tatha qui ne s\u2019explique pas d\u2019une mani\u00e8re obvie ?\n\nLa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question ne me para\u00eet pas difficile.

CHINIOt OF B\u0100BAR'S FIRST CAMPAIGN IN INDIA.\n\nBelfast, Oct. 27, 1898.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014In Mr. Beames' article on \"The Geography of the Kandah\u00e1r Inscription\" in the Society's Journal for October, 1898, after citing the references in B\u0101bar's Memoirs, pp. 254, 255, to the countries of Behrah, Khushab, Chen\u0101b, and Chani\u016bt, he identifies the last of these places (at p. 804) with \"Chiniot, a town on the Ravi near Gugaira,\" and interprets B\u0101bar's reference to it as meaning the Rechna Du\u0101b.\n\nChiniot is not on the Ravi, but on the Chen\u0101b, and is fully sixty miles from Gugaira, and about fifty miles from Bhera, which is almost due north of it. It is still a well-known town, and is the headquarters of a revenue subdivision (tahsil) of the Jhang district. It will be found under the name of Chanayot in the map of the Panjab illustrating Alexander's campaign, opposite p. 104 of Cunningham's \"Ancient Geography of India,\" and as Chandanvati in the following map; and a rocky hill near it is mentioned at p. 183. In an enumeration of old cities of the Panjab in the Archaeological Survey Report for 1872\u20133, at p. 94, Cunningham includes Sodra, Chaniot, and Shorkot on the Chen\u0101b.\n\nIt was while on his way across the Salt Range to Bhera in February, 1519 A.D., that B\u0101bar mentioned these countries, \"among which\" he \"now was\" (Dowson's Elliot, M.H., iv, 232), and which he desired to recover, as they had been in the possession of Sultan Mas'\u016bd Mirza, ruler of Kabul and Zabul. He appears to have meant the districts which were within easy reach of the fort of Bhera, and could be controlled by a force stationed there; and the mention of Chiniot indicates that the country in that neighbourhood, on both banks of the Chen\u0101b, was included. Some part of the Rechna Du\u0101b (between the Chen\u0101b and Ravi rivers) would thus be included, but probably not a very large part; and the country adjoining the Ravi, as well as the Upper\nRechna Du\u0101b, could hardly be referred to, as they would naturally be controlled by the garrison of Lahore.\n\nFrom the positions of Bhera, Khushab, and Chiniot it may fairly be inferred that the Chen\u0101b country embraced the greater part of the Lower Chaj Du\u0101b, except so far as this was included in the other three countries named. But as Khushab is only about forty miles in a straight line from Bhera, its territory can scarcely be said to comprise the southern part of the Sind S\u0101gar Du\u0101b. At most it would represent the middle part of that Du\u0101b, and probably it would not extend right across it to the Indus.\n\nIn the same article, at p. 801, last line, a comma is apparently omitted between Shor and Patan Shaikh Farid. Shor appears to be Shorkot, north of the confluence of the Ravi and the Chen\u0101b; while Patan Shaikh Farid is the place now known as P\u0101k Patan, the ancient Ajudhan, near which there was an important ferry over the Satlej (see Cunningham, \"Ancient Geography of India,\" p. 218).\u2014Yours truly,\n\nD. G. Barkley.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n3. Pedro Teixeira on the Veddas of Ceylon.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014None of the many writers on the Veddas of Ceylon seems to have called attention to what is, apparently, the earliest reference by a European writer\\(^1\\) to these \"wild men of the woods.\" This occurs in cap. xxxv of Pedro Teixeira's *Relaciones*,\\(^2\\) where, in one of his many digressions from the subject of his book, he refers to Ceylon, its products, etc. After speaking of cinnamon, he proceeds:\u2014\n\n\"And before leaving the forests where it [the cinnamon] grows in the same Island of Seylan, I shall relate the custom of a certain race that lives in them which is worthy of being known: these barbarians are called Pachas, and dwell naked in the thickets and\n\n\\(^1\\) I exclude the Greek and Latin authors quoted by Tennent, as their references are doubtful, to say the least.\n\n\\(^2\\) See R.A.S. Journal for 1897, pp. 624\u2013628, 933\u2013939.\nwoods, living on the fruits thereof: but their principal food is flesh of deer, of which the Island contains a large number, and killing many with bow and arrow they cut them in pieces, and in the trunks of the oldest and most worm-eaten trees, which on that account have most capacity, having filled them with honey, of which there is abundance there, they place as much of that flesh as will fill them, and leave it thus until the time of need, when they make use of it; which in the honey is preserved without corruption, and they eat it without preparing it in any other way; to which I refer on account of its being a strange manner of living.\"\n\nThat the above refers to the Veddas there cannot be the least doubt, the custom being described by Governor Rijklof van Goens\\(^1\\) in 1675, by Robert Knox\\(^2\\) in 1681, and by Captain Jo\u00e3o Ribeiro\\(^3\\) in 1685. Teixeira has, however, confused the Veddas with a low caste of Sinhalese, who, in early Portuguese times in Ceylon, appear to have led a bandit life in the western forests, armed (like the Veddas) with bows and arrows.\n\nThe earliest reference that I have found to these Pachas is in Couto (dec. V, liv. v, cap. viii), where, recounting the treacherous massacre in 1539, by command of Miguel Ferreira, of the Moors Pachi Marc\u00e1 and Cunhal\u00e9 Marc\u00e1, the historian says:\u2014\"And that night, as they were going through the forests, where by order of Madune were concealed many Pachas (who are a caste of Chingal\u00e1s of the most cruel nature, who when they have overthrown an enemy immediately cut off his nose and lips), as they were passing along they poured flights of arrows upon them, and one by one struck them all down, and cutting off their heads sent them to Miguel Ferreira, by which he was appeased.\"\n\nAgain, in his graphic description of the famous siege of Colombo by 'Raj\u00f9' (R\u0101ja Sinha I) in 1587, Couto (dec. X, liv. ix, cap. iv) says that at one of the posts of defence\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In Valentyn's \"Oud en nieuw Oost-Indien,\" deel v, \"Ceylon,\" p. 208.\n\\(^2\\) \"Hist. Rel.,\" p. 63.\n\\(^3\\) \"Fatalidade Hist.,\" p. 70.\nthe captain of the fortress placed \"some Dorias\" with their Pachas, who are a race low by blood, but valiant in war.\"\n\nFrom Bocarro (dec. 13, cap. clxviii) we learn that in 1617 the captain-major Manuel Cesar marched with his troops to Hiripitiya, in the H\u0101pitigam K\u014dral\u0113, \"a village of the faithless pachas,\" to inflict chastisement on them for their treachery.\n\nRibeiro (op. cit.) mentions the Pachas as a people of low caste; and from the Portuguese account of the siege of Colombo by the Dutch in 1655\u20136 embodied in Baldaeus's \"Ceylon,\" it seems that Pachas were still employed in the defence of the city, as they had been seventy years before. Valentyn (op. cit.) does not enumerate them in his elaborate list of castes; and the only mention of them that I have found in his work is in a list of castes in the dis\u0101vani of Colombo drawn up in 1707 by the Dessave Bolscho, where 922 \"Paatjes\" are entered, being preceded by \"Chialiassen\" (chaliyas, or cinnamon-peelers) and followed by \"Hunawas\" (him\u0101r\u014d, or washers for chaliyas).\n\nThe name 'Pacha,' as applied to a caste, appears to have died out in Ceylon. The word itself is simply Sinh. pa\u1e6d\u1e6da, pa\u1e6d\u1e6da, or pa\u1e6d\u1e6daya, \"Sudra, low and wicked man, one of a degraded tribe, mischievous fellow\" (Clough), the literal meaning being 'foot-born,' referring to the legendary origin of the Sudras.\u2014Yours very truly,\n\nCroydon, Oct. 1, 1898. Donald Ferguson.\n\n4. More Light on 'Omar Khay\u0101m.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to Professor Denison Ross's very interesting article, and to Mr. Burn's letter, I beg leave to point out that the true reading for the penultimate\n\n---\n\n1 A Dur\u0101ya is a headman of the jaggery, palankin-bearer, and cinnamon-peeler castes.\n2 The Portuguese diarist says: \"On the 13th four Pachas deserted.\" This the English translator (in Churchill's \"Voyages,\" vol. iii) renders: \"The 13th we sent away four Pachas, or Advice-boats\"? He evidently confounded Pachas with patasos.\nword of the first line of the verse quoted at p. 359 of the April number is \\( \\text{kham} \\) and not \\( \\text{ham} \\). Mr. Whinfield has shown me that this is the reading in the Lucknow edition of the quatrains, and I have since found it in three MSS. of the T\u0101r\u012bkh Alfi in the British Museum and in two in the India Office. This reading also makes better sense. What \u2018Omar said was, \u201cYou have gone and come back, nay, you have turned crooked,\u201d in allusion to the circumstance of the erect body of a man having been changed into the crooked or bent body of a quadruped. If the abridged copy of the T\u0101r\u012bkh Alfi referred to by Professor Schukovski be that described by Dr. Dorn in the M\u00e9langes Asiatiques, vi, 121, it is a very modern work, it having been written in 1834. The T\u0101r\u012bkh Alfi was written by the order of Akbar and dates from about 1586. The dates given in it are calculated from the death (Ri\u1e25lat) of Mu\u1e25ammad, and so are ten years less than the Hijra dates. Hence, when \u2018Omar Khay\u0101m\u2019s death is placed under the year 495 in the T\u0101r\u012bkh Alfi this means 505 A.H. But even then the date given for the death is twelve years less than the commonly accepted one (517 A.H.).\n\nThe notice in the T\u0101r\u012bkh Alfi is a curious one, and apparently longer than that in the abridgment used by Professor Schukovski. It begins in the same way as the extract at p. 358 of our Journal, but there seems to be some differences in the readings. \u2018Omar\u2019s ancestors, it tells us, came from Shamsh\u0101d. The Persian of the curious passage about \u2018Omar\u2019s avarice is: \u201caz w\u0101ste bakhal dar intishak-i-\u2018al\u016bm u \u1e6d\u012bnat dar ta\u1e63nif chand\u0101n as\u0101r\u012b nam\u0101nd.\u201d The story about the three friends is not given, but the story of the donkey is, and also the anecdotes about \u2018Omar\u2019s quarrel with Sult\u0101n Sanjar and about his last hours.\n\nThe new date for \u2018Omar\u2019s death is important, for it reduces the improbability of his having been a schoolfellow of Niz\u0101m al Mulk. Both Professor Browne and Professor Denison Ross reject the story about the three friends on account of alleged anachronisms, but is it really so unbelievable? Niz\u0101m al Mulk was born in 408 A.H., and was cut off by the hand\nof an assassin in 485 A.H. when he was about seventy-five years of age according to our calendar. Does the fact, if it be one, that Hasan died in 518 A.H., make it impossible that he should have been Niz\u0101m al Mulk's schoolfellow? We do not know how long the latter might have lived if he had not come by a violent death. At all events 'Omar Khay\u0101m might have been his contemporary, for he died in 505 A.H., or only twenty years after Niz\u0101m al Mulk was killed. Of course, if Hasan lived till 518, he can hardly have been born in 408, but he may have been some years younger than Niz\u0101m and still have been at school with him. It must be remembered, too, that Hasan certainly died at an advanced age, and that the period 408\u2013518 is not so formidable in the Muhammedan calendar as in the Christian. It amounts to 106 and not to 110 years.\n\nFor convenience of reference I note the pages in the MSS. which refer to 'Omar:\n\n1. B.M. MS., Or. 142, pp. 300c & b.\n2. Do. do. Add. 16,681, p. 526b.\n3.

No. 835, p. 248b.\n\nP.S.\u2014The Dast\u016br al Waz\u012bra of Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, a work written after the \u1e24ab\u012bba-s-suir, gives 478 as the date of \u1e24asan \u1e62ab\u0101h's death (B.M. MS., Or. 234, p. 906), and a notice in Schefer's Supplement, p. 56, which is put as if an extract from the Wa\u1e63\u0101ya, but does not occur in that work, gives 492 as the date. Probably, however, these are both mistakes. A better defence of the story may perhaps be found in the uncertainty about the date of Niz\u0101m al Mulk's birth. The commonly received date is 408, but that seems to rest on the authority of Arabic writers who were far removed in place, if not in time. The local history called the T\u0101rikh-i-Baihaq, which was written in the middle of the sixth century, gives 410 as the date (B.M. MS., Or. 3587, p. 43a, No. 89 of Rieu's Supplement), and the same date is given in the Nasakh.\nJah\u0101n\u0101va (B.M. MS., Or. 141, p. 89a). N\u012bz\u0101m himself, in a story accepted by Gibbon, is said to have declared himself to be 93 years of age. Certainly there is nothing in what is known of his career to make it necessary that he should have been born as early as 408. He was Prime Minister for thirty years, but he may have begun when he was thirty, and we do not hear of his being much employed in public affairs before 455. The only employment that we hear of was at Balkh, but as he was ill-treated there he probably did not remain long before he ran away.\n\nSomething, too, may be said for the verisimilitude of the story in the Wa\u1e63\u0101ya. That book cannot be older than the ninth or the end of the eighth century, but it was written by and for a descendant of the Vizier. It contains anecdotes of Alp Arslan and others, and one or two of them have been copied into the N\u012bg\u0101rist\u0101n. Are these also inventions? Is it not more likely that the author used, as he says he did, books and family traditions, and that there is a substratum of truth in the story of the three friends? It would help us in deciding on the authenticity of the story if we knew the date of the Im\u0101m Muwaffiq who is mentioned as the teacher of the friends, but it is difficult to identify him. H\u0101ji Khalfa (vi, 144, and iii, 316) speaks of an Im\u0101m Muwaffiq who died in 568, and Y\u0101q\u016bt (s.v. Bijist\u0101n) refers to an Ab\u016bl Q\u0101sim Muwaffiq who was greatly respected in N\u012bsh\u0101pur, and who flourished about 520. If either of these be the Muwaffiq of the Wa\u1e63\u0101ya the story is false. On the other hand, Im\u0101du-d-d\u012bn Isfah\u0101n\u012b, in an Arabic extract given at p. 115 of M. Schefer\u2019s Suppl\u00e9ment, quotes some one who speaks of an Im\u0101m Al Muwaffiq who was teaching in 434, and had \u2018Um\u012bd al Mulk Alkindar\u012b for a pupil. This seems to support the story. Alkindar\u012b was N\u012bz\u0101m\u2019s predecessor as Vizier, and was presumably older than he, for he was the minister of a previous king. If he was at school in 434, N\u012bz\u0101m may have been a later pupil. Indeed, if the story be true, he must have been about the last pupil that Muwaffiq had, for he was then over 85.\nI have gone into these details from a desire to support the story if possible, but I admit that the chronology is a difficulty. It is due to Mr. Whinfield to point out that the apparent anachronisms in the story were noticed by him several years ago, in the introduction to his translation of the quatrains.\n\nH. BEVERIDGE.\n\n5. ARI.\n\nThe histories of Burma, as stated by Sir A. P. Phayre in his work, published by Tr\u00fcbner & Co., p. 33, make mention of certain recluses or priests, called Ari, who conducted the religion prevalent at Pugan in the year A.D. 1000. Sir A. Phayre seems to think that they were the priests of N\u0101ga worship, and that their \"practices resembled those of the V\u0101m\u0101ch\u0101ris of Bengal.\" He, however, makes no attempt to explain the word, and now Mrs. Bode, who does not pretend to know anything about Burmese, suggests that it may be connected with ariyo. Mr. Tawseinko says, in his notes on the Kaly\u0101n\u012b inscriptions of King Dhammaceti of Pegu (A.D. 1469): \"A debased form of Buddhism, which was probably introduced from Northern India, existed at Pagan. Its teachers, called Aris, were not strict observers of their vow of celibacy; and it is expressly recorded in native histories that they had written records of their doctrines, the basis of which was that sin could be expiated by the recitation of certain hymns.\" He, too, makes no attempt to explain this word, whose spelling ought to have attracted notice.\n\nAs given in Stevenson's Dictionary, and in the copy of Burmese history in my possession, it is spelt \u1021\u101b\u103e\u1004\u103a, which properly transliterated would be ar\u0101\u1e45\u1e45, but, according to the modern pronunciation of Burmese, is now ari.\n\nIf this word were pure Burmese it would be a noun formed from the verb \u101b\u103e\u1004\u103a, which might be pronounced either as ri, reh, or rin, with a heavy accent. There is\nno verb of this kind in present use, though one, now obsolete, is found in the word \u1e5bitt\u0101, 'to indulge in mutual love.'\n\nIt is therefore reasonable to suppose that the word has been borrowed from some foreign language\u2014Sanskrit or P\u0101li; and, if so, the : at the end shows that it has been abbreviated.\n\nThere is a similar word, byeet, 'a consonant,' which is undoubtedly the shortened form of byanjanam.\n\nAs the letter \u1e5b in the middle of a word is usually \u1e5b\u1e45, as in pa\u1e45\u00f1a, su\u1e45\u00f1a, I feel sure that stands for ara\u00f1\u00f1aka or ara\u00f1\u00f1ako, 'one who dwells in the forest.'\n\nWhether these 'forest-dwellers' were priests of a N\u0101ga cult, or like the V\u0101m\u0101ch\u0101ris of Bengal, according to Phayre, remains to be proved. Burmese histories cannot be relied on, especially with reference to the period prior to A.D. 1000. They have evidently been written up according to the fancy of the compiler or his patron.\n\nFor instance, Phayre says (p. 21): \"Nearly two centuries later (A.D. 924) it is related that in the reign of an usurper, Soa Rahan, a corrupt worship called Nag\u0101, or dragon worship, was introduced.\" He also states that Soa Rahan caused the image of a dragon to be set up and worshipped.\n\nOther historians, however, state that Soa Rahan, or Pupp\u0101-tsoa-rahan (Pubb\u0101-chao-arahan) was a monk who married the queen of the preceding monarch, and was an exceedingly religious Buddhist, who was learned in the Bidagat and Bedin (Pitaka and Vedas), and make no mention of N\u0101ga worship or other heresies.\n\nSeeing that the historians of Burma cannot be relied on, the only course is to search thoroughly for the early traces\nof the prevalent religion amongst the ruins of Tagoung and Old Pugan, in latitude 23\u00b0 N. or thereabouts, and not in New Pugan below Ava, which was not founded till many years later.\n\nR.

THE TANTRAS.\n\nCHER MONSIEUR RHYS DAVIDS,\u2014Je viens de lire l'article qu'un de vos plus \u00e9minents collaborateurs a bien voulu me faire l'honneur de consacrer dans notre Journal \u00e0 l'examen d'un volume d'\u00e9tudes bouddhiques que j'ai r\u00e9cemment publi\u00e9 (Octobre, 1898, pp. 909 et suivantes).\n\nVoulez-vous me permettre de vous dire deux mots \u00e0 ce sujet. Aux d\u00e9ductions de M. Rapson, je pourrais opposer des arguments tout aussi solides \u00e0 mon point de vue, et l'unique r\u00e9sultat de cette joute courtoise serait d'accuser la divergence irr\u00e9ductible de nos opinions, de notre m\u00e9thode, de nos tendances. Une remarque cependant : au fond, comme il arrive presque toujours, la divergence initiale porte sur la d\u00e9finition des termes : M. Rapson appelle 'Bouddhisme' la doctrine pr\u00each\u00e9e par \u015a\u0101kyamuni ; j'appelle 'Bouddhisme' l'\u00e9tat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de croyance qui s'est condens\u00e9 autour du nom du Buddha. L'un comme l'autre sont en dehors de notre atteinte directe ; l'hypoth\u00e8se est notre seul guide et bien arbitraire. Le temps, les d\u00e9couvertes nouvelles, la connaissance plus exacte de l'Inde tireront sans doute la lumi\u00e8re de ce chaos. Soyons, en attendant, indulgents les uns aux autres ; essayons de nous comprendre, cherchons \u00e0 nous aider les uns les autres.\n\nM. Rapson ne cache pas son m\u00e9pris pour \"l'infect Tantrisme.\" Je ne suis vraiment pas suspect de tendresse \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des Tantras : j'en ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9 quelques-uns\u2014besogne p\u00e9nible et qui de prime abord ne vous paie pas de vos peines. Eh bien, je les trouve int\u00e9ressants, je constate qu'ils sont inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 toutes les formes religieuses de l'Inde, je\nles crois n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la connaissance de ce que j'appelle le Bouddhisme. Ils vous choquent : j'en suis chagrin, mais avouez que je n'y peux rien. D\u00e9clarer inutile l'\u00e9tude des Tantras sous pr\u00e9texte qu'ils sont modernes, c'est vraiment abuser d'une pr\u00e9misse peu stable et mal d\u00e9finie.\n\nJe vous prie de bien vouloir agr\u00e9er, cher Monsieur Rhys Davids, l'expression de mes sentiments respectueusement d\u00e9vou\u00e9s.\n\nLouis de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin.\n\nWetteren (Gand), Nov. 29, 1898.\n\n[I think a reader of my notice will see that I do not mean to say, and did not say, that the study of the Tantras was useless because the Tantras are modern. They are a phase of Indian belief, and unquestionably come to form a part of later Buddhism, but I cannot see that there is any evidence to indicate the slightest connection between them and early Buddhism\u2014whatever definition may be given of that term. The study of each and every phase of Indian belief seems to me important, and Indianists are to be congratulated that a scholar, to whose wide and varied learning I ventured to call attention, has taken up the study of what is not a very pleasant subject, and has therefore been avoided by others.

The Mohammadan Calendar.\n\nWandsworth, Dec. 17, 1898.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Why does Mr. C. J. Rodgers think that the t\u0101rikh on the date of the battle of P\u0101nipat \"is certainly one day wrong\" when it states that the battle was fought on the morning of Friday, the 7th of Rajab, A.H. 932? (cf. p. 729 of the current number of this Journal). Does he merely think so, because according to the ideal chronology that Friday fell on the 8th of Rajab? If so, may I suggest\nthat he should peruse a brief note by Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole in the current (October) number of the *English Historical Review*. Although we have the testimony of Sultan Suleyman's diary to prove that the Friday in question was reckoned as the 8th of Rajab in Stambul, yet the author of the *t\u0101r\u012bkh* may still be right. The obvious explanation is, that in his neighbourhood the new moon was observed a day earlier at the beginning of the month than in the Turkish capital.\n\n**Lewis L. Kropf.**\n\n*To the Hon.

Price 3s.)\n\nThis is the first volume of a contemplated series of translations of \u015aa\u1e45kara's commentaries on the Upanishads. It would have been more useful if the title had made this clear, as the sole value of the undertaking is precisely the English translation of these commentaries. It will be a distinct advantage to the student of the historical development of religious thought in India to have this English version of the eighth-century interpretation of the old Upanishads. Unfortunately the English is neither forcible nor always exact. The student can find a reference to any point he is engaged on more easily by means of the translation. But he will naturally wish also to refer back to the text. It would, therefore, be a great advantage in any future volumes to insert, in brackets, the number of the page of the original, at the place where the translation of that page begins. And there should be a complete alphabetical index of all the separate words explained by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, and also of the subjects discussed. As it stands, the little volume will be more useful as an edifying manual of the later Advaitism than as a help to the study of the old Upanishads themselves.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nETYMOLOGIE DES SINGHALESISCHEN, VON WILHELM GEIGER.\n\nProceedings of the Royal Academy of Bavaria.

(Wiesbaden: Kreidel, 1898.)\n\nIn the first of the above publications by the able and versatile Professor of Indo-European languages at the University of Erlangen, he has made a considerable step towards a scientific treatment of the language of Ceylon. It is the firstfruits of the special journey he undertook to that beautiful island in order to gather, on the spot, materials for his forthcoming monograph on the Ceylon Language and Literature to be published in B\u00fchler's \"Grundriss.\" And very pleasant are the anticipations it raises of the future results we may expect from that journey, of which he has also published so interesting an account in the second volume named above.\n\nOur members will recollect the very valuable papers contributed to this Journal by the late Professor Childers in 1876 and 1877 on the Sanskrit origin of Sinhalese. Professor Ernst Kuhn in 1879 and Professor Eduard M\u00fcller during the years 1880\u201382 carried the investigation further. But these papers are all of a fragmentary nature, and do not even attempt to deal at large with the very important historical results which may be expected from a full study of the language and the literature of the Sinhalese. Professor Geiger has now set himself resolutely to the task of dealing with these questions as a whole; and his present treatise on the etymology of Sinhalese gives us every hope that it will at last be adequately and thoroughly dealt with.\n\nIt is not easy to explain the neglect with which this interesting language has been treated. The records of the Sinhalese language, both in books and in inscriptions, go back much further than those of any other Indian Prakrit.\nThe level of general culture, and of literary effort, in Ceylon, has always been very high. Since the more learned among the Sinhalese began to write in their spoken language also, as well as in Pali, there has been a constant succession of literary productions of a high class. And though there are no books extant of an earlier date than the ninth or tenth century, there are inscriptions going back at least to the third, if not earlier. We have, therefore, a long series of documents from which the gradual evolution of the dialect and the history of the literature can be very fully traced out\u2014longer, indeed, than is the case, for instance, with English.\n\nOne reason why these valuable records have not been hitherto utilized is the want of texts. Since the English took possession of the island the patronage extended so often by the native kings to literature and scholarship has practically ceased. Whereas the home Government issues a magnificent series of editions of ancient texts dealing with the former condition of the country, the Ceylon Government has hitherto printed only one, the well-known chronicle called the Mah\u0101vamsa, and that is in Pali, not in Sinhalese. And the only Sinhalese text so far printed in Europe is my Yog\u0101vacara Manual issued last year\u2014and that, too, is so full of Pali quotations that they occupy about half the book. What is, therefore, most urgently wanted is a series of the ancient texts properly edited by competent scholars with suitable introduction and notes. Such a project cannot be carried out by private enterprise. It would be impossible for any publisher to recoup the expenses required. It would redound to the credit of any Government in Ceylon who should do for the ancient literature of that island what the Record Office publications have done so well for the corresponding texts in England.\n\nT. W. Rhys Davids.\nArchitectural Remains, Anuradhapura, Ceylon; comprising the d\u0101gabas and certain other ruined structures. Measured, drawn, and described by James G. Smither, F.R.I.B.A., late Architect to the Government of Ceylon. Sixty-seven plates. Published by order of the Ceylon Government. Imperial folio; pp. ii, 64.\n\nSuch is the title of a large and highly important work on the ancient Buddhist architecture of Ceylon, which has been presented to the Society by the author. With the exception of a few scattered reports, this is the first book on the subject which has been written by a professional architect, and it contains results of the explorations carried out by himself under the order of the Ceylon Government. We are indebted to the late Sir Hercules Robinson, afterwards Lord Rosmead, whilst Governor of Ceylon, for initiating the survey, which has since received the patronage of his successors, and is being now ably carried on, on a larger scale, by Mr. H. C. P. Bell.\n\nThe present volume is unfortunately not handy for general use on account of both its unwieldy size and the want of proper indexes. It deals with seven d\u0101gabas, three palaces, and a bathing-pond, as follows: (1) the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gaba, (2) the Lank\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gaba, (3) the Mirisav\u0113ti d\u0101gaba, (4) the Ruvanveli d\u0101gaba, (5) the Abhayagiri d\u0101gaba, (6) the Jetavan\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gaba, (7) the Kujjatissar\u0101ma d\u0101gaba, (8) the Dalad\u0101 M\u0101lig\u0101va, (9) the Mahasen\u2019s pavilion, (10) the Queen\u2019s pavilion, and (11) the K\u016b\u1e6d\u1e6dam pokuna.\n\nWe need not draw special attention to the accuracy of Mr. Smither\u2019s drawings of the ruins. So far as excavations permitted him at the time, he has done his work admirably. The reader himself will recognize it on an examination of the sixty-seven plates, which are drawn to a large scale, and which form the greater portion of the work. The descriptions are prefaced by a historical account of each ruin, mostly derived from Turnour\u2019s translation of the Mah\u0101vamsa. In these we are sorry to find inaccuracies, especially in the spelling, the etymology, and\nthe meaning of native terms. The mistakes could have easily been avoided, had the author had his last proof revised by a competent P\u0101li and Sinhalese scholar, and had he used Vijesinha's translation of the Mah\u0101vamsa instead of Turnour's. We find, for example, Pr\u0101krama for Par\u0101krama, Devenipiatissa for Deveni-p\u0113tis or Dev\u0101nampiyatissa, Atamosthana vandaname for Atamasth\u0101na vandan\u0101va, Duttugaimunu for Dutugemunu, D\u0101th\u0101d\u0101tu for D\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101dh\u0101tu, Golak\u0101bhayo for Go\u1e6dh\u0101bhaya, Mah\u0101wamma for M\u0101navamma, Ambust\u0101la for Ambasthala, etc.\n\nThe ruins dealt with in the work under review do not, of course, represent all the types of architecture found even in Anuradhapura alone. But the d\u0101gabas being the principal feature in Buddhistic monuments, the author has rightly devoted the greater portion of his book to their description. One of the earliest amongst these d\u0101gabas is the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gaba, which was built, according to the Sinhalese chroniclers, by Dev\u0101nampiyatissa (the contemporary of Asoka), 307\u2013267 B.C. The author has identified this d\u0101gaba with the one so named at present, and situated to the north of the Ruvanvel\u012b d\u0101gaba. In this identification he has followed the current tradition and the belief of previous writers. But so far as we are aware, no proper record or monument has as yet been found which definitely confirms the tradition.\n\nWithout repeating his lucid descriptions, it will not, perhaps, be out of place to draw attention to certain points of interest. An important feature of the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma and the La\u1e45k\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gabas is the existence of concentric circles of pillars round them. Several theories regarding the purpose for which these pillars were intended have been put forward.\n\nFergusson supposed that they represent the rails of the Indian topes, the pillars being originally \"connected with one another by beams of wood on their capitals,\" from which painted frames or curtains may have been suspended. The author thinks that the pillars were surmounted by emblematic figures and ornaments of some kind.\nMr. H. W. Cave, in his beautifully illustrated work \"The Ruined Cities of Ceylon,\" supports this theory, and adds: \"they were doubtless used on festal occasions to suspend strings of lamps and garlands, always one of the chief features of Buddhist ceremonial\" (p. 41).\n\nThe other theory, more or less based on certain passages in Turnour's translation of the Mah\u0101vamsa, is that the pillars supported a roof which covered the entire d\u0101gaba. But the author, after a careful examination of the building, concluded that it was impossible, from an architectural point of view, for these pillars to have supported a roof of 65 feet span, elevated 23 feet above ground. The theory, however, that they may have sustained some other kind of roof has not been disproved.\n\nThe following is the opinion of Mr. C. R. Peers, as an architect:\n\n\"From an inspection of the measured drawings and restorations of the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gaba\u2014plates iv and v in Mr. Smither's book\u2014it would appear that it would have been quite possible that the concentric circles of pillars supported architraves, probably of wood; but it does not appear, from the relative positions of the pillars in one circle to those in the next, that the original design included any form of timber roofing, such as raking rafters running from one circle to the next. Also, there is no provision made, as far as can be judged from the present condition of the building, for counteracting the thrust which would result from such a construction. If the wall marked on the plan as 'parapet' was originally as high as the fourth or outermost circle of pillars, it would, of course, have been possible to roof the space between it and these pillars.\n\n\"In plate xi, the plan of the Lank\u0101r\u0101ma d\u0101gaba, the positions of the two inner circles of pillars allow of the possibility of constructing a raking roof, the thrust of which might be taken by the brick wall marked on the plan as existing inside the third circle of pillars\u2014over the two inner circles of pillars and the space between them and the brick wall.\"\n\"On the archaeological aspect of the question, I am quite unqualified to express any opinion.\"\n\nTradition and written history, moreover, agree as regards the existence of a roofed structure at the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma. The passage Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma Th\u016bpagharam, in the Mah\u0101vamsa, xxxv, vv. 87 and 91, clearly indicates it, and Mr. Smither is right in saying that by the word th\u016bpa-gharam the ancient chronicler referred to \"a structure within which the d\u0101gaba was enclosed,\" but this edifice must have been, at least partially, roofed over, as we find it recorded (ch. xlix, v. 81) that Vajira, one of the generals of Dappula III (A.D. 827\u2013843), \"covered the Th\u016bpa house at the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma with tiles of gold as became it, and fixed doors also of gold to the house.\" Besides, there is no quotable example in the whole range of Sanskrit and Pr\u0101k\u1e5bita literature where the word gharam or Skt. griha is used to mean a roofless structure (cf. Patim\u0101-gharam, bodhi-gharam, etc.). Mr. Smither's criticism on Turnour's translation of the passage (in Mah., xxxv, 88), th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma th\u016bpagharam k\u0101r\u0101pesi mahipati, is also not quite accurate. By Turnour's expression \"the roof over the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma,\" he probably meant a roof only over the \u0101r\u0101ma, or the sacred ground round the th\u016bpa, and certainly not over the large th\u016bpa. The Wa\u1e6da-da-ge referred to by Mr. Smither was a circular building at the Th\u016bp\u0101r\u0101ma, and was distinct from the Th\u016bpagharam.\n\nIn reference to the other ruins, we may observe that Mr. Smither has followed the traditional identification of them. He has not attempted to find out how far this identification can be verified either by authentic monuments found in course of excavation or in their absence by collateral evidence derived especially from native records. His historical sketches of the ruins and the theories based on them can, therefore, hold good only if the identifications are correct. On the other hand, his accurate descriptions of the ruins as they stand at present are invaluable. With the extended operations of the Ceylon Archaeological Survey now being excellently carried on by Mr. H. C. P. Bell, and\nwith the publication of many of the ancient native chronicles, it is hoped that materials will be brought to light which will settle the doubts as to the identity of these ruins, and enable Mr. Bell to make a plan of Anuradhapura as it stood in ancient times when it was the capital of Ceylon.\n\nSELECTED POEMS FROM THE D\u012aV\u0100N-I-SHAMS-I-TABR\u012aZ,\nedited and translated, with an Introduction, Notes, and Appendices, by REYNOLD A. NICHOLSON, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. (Cambridge: University Press, 1898.)\n\nPersian poetry is, without doubt, better of its kind than Persian prose; the best Persian poetry is, on the whole, that of the mystics; and Jal\u0101lu'd-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b, if he be not, as Mr. Nicholson reckons him (p. viii), \"the greatest mystical poet of any age,\" is assuredly in the very highest rank of those divinely intoxicated dreamers whose spirits, \"freed,\" as H\u0101fidh has it, \"from all that wears the colour of attachment,\" hang poised in the fathomless empyrean of the Transcendental. It is unnecessary in this place to recapitulate the facts known to us of a life singularly uneventful for one who was contemporary with Changiz and H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b Kh\u0101ns, and whose peaceful retreat at Qonya (Iconium) can hardly have altogether shut out the storm of consternation produced in the Mu\u1e25ammadan world by the Monghol invasion, the sack of Baghdad, and the extinction of the 'Abb\u0101sid Caliphate. His great mystical Mathnawi, an inexhaustible storehouse of transcendental lore, has long been famous both in the East and in the West, and, though it has not yet found a European editor, is accessible to us in several unusually excellent Oriental editions, amongst which those of Bul\u0101q and T\u012bhr\u0101n (ed. 'Al\u0101'u'd-Dawla, A.H. 1299 and 1307, with Kashfu'l-aby\u0101t or Concordance of verses) merit especial praise. To the English reader also it has been made known by Sir James Redhouse's versified translation of Book i, and by Mr. Whinfield's excellent selections.\nIt is otherwise with Jal\u0101lu\u2019d-D\u012bn\u2019s lyrical poetry, that vast collection of amazing rhapsodies (of which there exist single MSS. containing nearly 60,000 couplets; in other words, equal in extent to the *Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma*) composed in the name and to the glory of Shams-i-Tabriz, \u201cthat weird figure, wrapt in coarse black felt, who flits across the stage for a moment and disappears tragically enough.\u201d Very striking is the parallel drawn by Mr. Nicholson in the work before us (p. xx) in the following words:\u2014\u201cHe was comparatively illiterate, but his tremendous spiritual enthusiasm, based on the conviction that he was a chosen organ and mouthpiece of Deity, cast a spell over all that entered the enchanted circle of his power. In this respect, as in many others\u2014for example, in his strong passions, his poverty, and his violent death\u2014Shams-i-Tabriz curiously resembles Socrates: both imposed themselves upon men of genius, who gave their crude ideas artistic expression; both proclaim the futility of external knowledge, the need of illumination, the value of love; but wild raptures and arrogant defiance of every human law can ill atone for the lack of that \u2018sweet reasonableness\u2019 and moral grandeur which distinguish the sage from the devotee.\u201d\n\nOf this *Div\u0101n*, which, though written, as already said, in the name of Shams-i-Tabriz, is well known to be the work of Jal\u0101lu\u2019d-D\u012bn, there exist two Oriental editions (Tabr\u012bz, A.H. 1280; Lakhnaw, A.H. 1295); an Anthology (*Auswahl*) by Rosenzweig, containing seventy-five odes with German verse translations (Vienna, 1838); and a fair number of MSS., which differ in an extraordinary degree as to extent and arrangement. The editions and seven MSS., of which the most ancient, dated A.H. 774 (A.D. 1372), is in the British Museum, as well as a large number of other works, Arabic, Persian, and European, have been used by Mr. Nicholson in the preparation of the excellent and finished piece of work which now lies before us, whereof, it may be added, the form is worthy of the matter. It contains an Introduction (pp. xv\u2013li) singularly original and rich in suggestions; forty-eight of the odes (including only\nfour of those selected by Rosenzweig) with English prose translations (pp. 2\u2013195); excellent Notes (pp. 197\u2013330); four Appendices (pp. 331\u2013350); and Arabic and English Indices (pp. 351\u2013367). Of the Appendices, the first contains some illustrative passages from the *Dir\u0101n*, showing the close analogy which exists between the \u1e62\u016bf\u012b and the Neo-Platonist doctrines, together with a list of the historical and autobiographical allusions (comparatively few in number) which it contains; while the second comprises translations in verse of five of the odes. It were greatly to be wished that the number of these had been increased, for Mr. Nicholson has a very happy knack of producing verse-renderings at once graceful and true to the original, as, for example, the following (pp. 46\u20139 and 343\u20135):\n\n```\n\u0647\u0631 \u0646\u0642\u0634\u0631\u0627 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u062c\u0646\u0633\u0634 \u0632\u0644\u0627\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\u06af\u0631 \u0646\u0642\u0634 \u0631\u0641\u062a \u063a\u0645 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0635\u0644\u0634 \u062c\u0648 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u060c\n```\n\n\"Poor copies out of heaven's original,\nPalo earthly pictures mouldering to decay,\nWhat care altho' your beauties break and fall,\nWhen that which gave them life endures for aye?\"\n\nBad verse-translations are certainly not to be encouraged, and a very good scholar may be a very bad versifier; but where the gift of song is conjoined with the scholarship, there can be no question that, in the case of poetry, a rendering into verse, even though it be at times somewhat free, far more truly reflects the original than a bald prose version, however literal. The impulse given to Persian studies in Germany and England by the genius of R\u00fcckert and FitzGerald is a sufficient witness to the truth of this assertion. It behoves Orientalists to remember that nothing will ultimately conduce so much to the advancement of their favourite studies as an increase in the interest of the general reading public in their results; and that, in literature, form, if not everything, is at least a very important factor.\nOf the text and translations of the odes selected from the *Divan* by Mr. Nicholson, we need only say that they display the most careful and scholarly workmanship, and that only in a very few places could we, after a careful scrutiny, suggest any change\u2014for instance, in the seventh couplet of Ode IV (pp. 14-15):\n\n\u0645\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0622\u0645\u062f \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0633 \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0627 \u0632\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f\u060c\n\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u0633\u062a \u0645\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0627.\n\nHere the point of the last line is, perhaps, insufficiently emphasized by the translation \u201cOur copper has been transmuted by this rare alchemy.\u201d The translation should rather run:\n\n\u201cTis notorious that copper is transmuted by the Philosopher\u2019s Stone into gold,\n[But] our copper has been transmuted by this rare Alchemy into the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\u201d\n\nThe \u201crare Alchemy\u201d is so called because it not only transmutes into gold that which is subjected to its influence, but bestows on it its own power to effect this transmutation in others.\n\nThe Notes which illustrate the Odes are rich and suggestive, indicating in particular a very wide familiarity with the writings of the great mystics of both East and West. In this respect Mr. Nicholson follows with success the excellent methods employed by Mr. Whinfield, notably in his scholarly edition and translation of the *Gulshan-i-R\u0101s*. From Mr. Whinfield\u2019s conclusions, however, he differs in assigning to Christian influences a much smaller share in the moulding of Sufi doctrine. In this view we concur, and still more strongly in the thesis which Mr. Nicholson so ably maintains that Sufism, in so far as it is not an independent growth, owes more to Neo-Platonism than to any other system. We have been too long misled by vague generalities about \u201cAryan reactions against Semitic thought\u201d and \u201cIndo-Iranian affinities,\u201d into ignoring the\nhistorical fact that the complex Perso-Arabian civilization of the 'Abb\u0101sid Caliphate, while owing comparatively little to India, borrowed with both hands from the Alexandrian philosophers. Of these Porphyry (and even, perhaps, Iamblichus) was better known to them than Plotinus, though Mr. Nicholson is in error when he says (p. xxx), following Renan, that the name of the latter was unknown in the East, for he is explicitly mentioned in the *Fihrist* (p. 255) as *Flatinus* (\u0641\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0646\u0633), while, as shown by Haarbr\u00fccker, it is he to whom Shahr\u012bst\u0101n\u012b refers under the title of \"the Greek Shaykh\" (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u06cc\u062e \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a).\n\nA very interesting portion of Mr. Nicholson's Introduction is that (\u00a7 8, pp. xxxvi et seqq.) in which he endeavours to trace the external influences which may have helped to form Jal\u0101lu'd-D\u012bn's style\u2014a fruitful line of inquiry which might well be extended. Naturally he puts in the first place S\u0101m\u016b'\u012b and 'Attar, to whom Jal\u0101lu'd-D\u012bn avows his obligations; but he also finds references to, or reflections of, Sa'di, Nidh\u0101m\u012b of Ganja, and 'Omar-i-Khayy\u0101m.

IN THE LIBRARY OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM. By R. K. DOUGLAS, Keeper of Oriental Books and MSS. (Printed by order of the Trustees.)\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to review a catalogue of this kind in such a manner as to do justice to the author and avoid weariness to the reader. Catalogue-makers, like lexicographers, eminently deserve a gratitude they rarely obtain. This is pre-eminently the case with Professor Douglas in the present instance. Some early Spanish missionary described the scripts of Japan as a \"conciliabulo de los demonios para enojar \u00e1 los fideles,\" and the confusions of Japanese literary and artistic nomenclature are even more perplexing. A Japanese author or artist appears to live in a succession of constant name-changes, and to shun\ndiligently the use of his own name. Thus, Hokusai had more than a dozen known names; Bakin, whose real name was Takizawa Kai, used such appellations as Sakitsu, Saritsu, Raisai, Gend\u00f4, and half a dozen others; while one author is mentioned in Professor Douglas' preface as \"rejoicing\" (did he rejoice? if so, it was a solitary joy) in twenty-three names!\n\nBut this was not Professor Douglas' only difficulty. The titles of Japanese books are usually written with Chinese characters. But how are these to be read? In many cases, one may say, they are not to be read at all, save with the eye. But if read phonetically it is very often not even in Japano-Chinese, nor in pure Japanese, but in a mixture of the two, the exact rendering of the Japanese portion being in too many instances in the highest degree uncertain. Lastly, there is the difficulty of recognizing foreign names spelled in Japanese kana. 'Makusu Muy\u00fbraru' perhaps most persons will recognize, but it is less easy to disinter 'Muirhead' from 'Boiren,' and in not a few instances even Prof. Douglas has been obliged to abandon the task.\n\nThere are really four catalogues comprised in the book\u2014principal and supplementary catalogues of authors, with their works arranged under their names, and a fairly abundant number of cross references, giving titles (with their translations) of 16,000 works, a catalogue of book-titles with proper references, and a valuable index of the more important books with their authors arranged in order of subjects. Perhaps to the student of Japanese literature this is much the most useful part of the volume, for it must be confessed that a considerable proportion of the books contained in the principal and supplementary catalogues are of little, if any value, many being translations from common European books and works of a purely ephemeral utility, marking no stage or phase in the course of Japanese civilization or history. This redundancy, however, is due to no fault of Professor Douglas, but is rather his burden, for it has added immensely to his task, and deprived him of time which doubtless he would much rather have given to brief\ndescriptions of the standard works in Japanese literature, which after all are not very numerous and might have been sufficiently described in a score or so of pages.\n\nIn the execution of his task Professor Douglas is a pioneer. No such work exists in any Western language, or has ever been attempted, and even in Japanese I only remember one, the \"Gunsho ichiran.\"\n\nF. Victor Dickins.\n\nMuhammeds Lehre von der Offenbarung quellenm\u00e4\u00dfig untersucht, von Dr. Otto Pautz. 8vo; pp. 304. (Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1898.)\n\nRecent events in the East prompted the author to write this book. The Moslim world has, indeed, been brought in such close contact with European culture of late, that the duty of making themselves acquainted with the principal tenets of Isl\u0101m devolves upon all those who are affected by these events. The quickest way to accomplish this is to study the life of its founder, and to follow step for step the first movements of his faith. It is, however, just here where the greatest difficulty lies, because the origin of Isl\u0101m is even now anything but clear, in spite of the excellent works we possess on Muhammed's biography.\n\nThe problem Dr. Pautz has set himself is to describe the Muhammedan doctrine of revelation, and to explain the essence, tenets, and vehicles of the same. To this end he has acquired a thorough knowledge of the Arabic sources, and has bestowed much care on the study of the Qor\u0101n, which is not the most attractive of readings. He has also contributed many valuable remarks on the exegesis of this book, a subject which has not yet found all the attention it deserves.\n\nYet as regards the treatment of the main question, viz., the powers which brought Isl\u0101m into existence, Dr. Pautz's book is rather disappointing. Upon the point of view from which we eye the impetus which urged Muhammed into the career of a reformer, our conception of the nature of\nMuhammedan revelation must largely depend; and here the author merely repeats what is already known. The rise of Isl\u0101m is a subject for the historian rather than the theologian, because predisposition of any kind mars criticism in this field as well as in any other. No one can blame Muhammed for having attacked Judaism and Christianity, nor was it always misguided judgment which caused him to reject the doctrines of the two older churches. The late Professor Palmer already raised the question: why did not Muhammed rather accept either of these creeds than found a new one (The Qur\u2019\u0101n, transl., vol. i, p. li)? This was exactly what he could not do, because some dogmas of the one appeared irreconcilable with his conception of the Unity of God, whilst the law code of the other was incompatible with the conditions of life in Arabia, with the habits of the people, and with many sources of the national wealth. This detracts but little from the surprising merit of having rendered monotheism victorious against such tremendous odds. Like his predecessors, Dr. Pautz makes Muhammed ponder in the solitude of Mount Hir\u0101 on the real essence and the proper veneration of God (pp. 15\u201316), and that it was on this spot where the birth of the new idea took place. He evidently means that Muhammed found monotheism spontaneously. This I do not believe. The Moslim traditions on the first revelation (Qor., xcvi, 1\u20135), in which Dr. Pautz seems to place some reliance, were not conceived till many years later, nor without the assistance of the Prophet himself, and they deserve no credence at all. The legends on the iqra\u2019-verse\u2014as can be clearly shown\u2014form part of a circle of homilies which in their simplest form evidently originate from one and the same author. For the first word of v. 1, which Dr. Pautz also and justly regards as the oldest of the Qor\u0101n, he has very properly adopted Noeldeke\u2019s translation, Predige, which is superior to any other. He notes the derivation which I suggested in 1883 (R.E.J., p. 188, and Beitr\u00e4ge zur Erkl\u00e4rung des Qor\u0101n, p. 6) from Gen., xii, 8, and similar verses, although he does not think it correct. This derivation,\nhowever, becomes more patent to me the more closely I examine it. It is only necessary to consider that post-Biblical Jews pronounced the Tetragram by Ad\u00f4nai (my Lord), which the LXX rendered by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, the Pshitha by m\u0101ry\u0101. Why should Muhammed in his first proclamation use rabb(ika), which is the exact Arabic translation of the same term? Is this not also verbatim the same verse? It therefore makes no difference whether he heard the verse in Hebrew or Syriac, from a Jew or a Christian. Now the addition of the words \u2018who has created\u2019 (viz. \u2018man,\u2019 as in v. 2) gives in one short phrase the whole idea of Gen., ch. i. In this manner Muhammed managed in a proclamation of five words to teach the existence of God, his Unity, and that he is the Creator. Should this represent the result of the musings of an unlettered man? The iqra\u2019-verse is the key to the right comprehension of Muhammed\u2019s prophetic afflatus. When once he had succeeded in convincing his countrymen of these three principles, everything else became, by the force of circumstance, but the natural sequence. Traditionists may relate what suits them, but all that is said of Muhammed\u2019s mental struggle, that he believed himself possessed by a demon, or that the archangel Gabriel acted as intermediator, must be abandoned. Never was a man more conscious of his actions than Muhammed was when he proclaimed his first address, nor does this lessen the admiration due to him; for it required great moral courage to take this first but decisive step. Of course a proof of the existence of God must not be expected in the Qor\u00e2n, as this is a postulate in a revealed religion, but Muhammed made a distinct attempt to demonstrate His Unity (Qor., xxiii, 93; xxi, 22). On the formulas of Unification there is a great deal more to say than Dr. Pautz has done. The phrase \u201cThere is no God besides All\u00e2h\u201d is but the final crystallization of several attempts to condense the first article of the Moslim creed into a motto.\n\nMore satisfactory are Dr. Pautz\u2019s remarks about the difference Muhammed endeavoured to establish between himself and the K\u00fbhins (soothsayers) of his people. The\nsame is to be said about the observation that, in order to intensify the grandeur and mysteriousness of his revelations, Muhammed frequently substituted indefinite terms or the pronouns 'it' and 'this' for 'Qor\u0101n'; but this again proves with what shrewd calculation he proceeded. Fully justified is the remark that the doctrine of original sin is nowhere to be found in the Qor\u0101n, and the survey of the various terms used to describe the revelations is really helpful from an exegetical point of view.\n\nNot tenable, however, is Dr. Pautz's observation that human free-will appears unchecked in the Qor\u0101n, because it is preached side by side with its opposite. The subject is too vast to allow of more than a few words on it here. Muhammed had evidently meditated on this problem, and as taught both in Jewish and Christian writings, but found it too hard to solve. In his theory of predestination he was not able to distinguish between man's responsibility for his actions, and his fate, which are both in the same 'Book.' Whilst on the one hand trying to raise the standard of morals, it was his interest to minimize the belief that man could shape his own fate. The political aspect of this question Dr. Pautz has overlooked entirely. Muhammed's aim was to ensure absolute obedience, and next to the belief in All\u0101h hardly any dogma is enjoined with the same emphasis as to obey 'his prophet.' As the fate of everyone who took part in a battle was sealed beforehand the command of recklessness was superfluous.\n\nThe charge Muhammed brought against the Jews and Christians of having falsified their holy writings must be explained rather than refuted, because from his point of view it was not unfounded. One of his accusations is, that the Rabbis by writing laws \"with their hands\" placed themselves on a level with God (Qor., ii, 73). Dr. Pautz is not sufficiently acquainted with Rabbinical literature to see the connection between this and innumerable passages in the Qor\u0101n, and to give due appreciation to what others have said on this matter.\n\nThe question whether Muhammed was able to write and\nread is not so immaterial as our author assumes, since it in some way concerns the criticism of the Qor\u0101n. It is at least certain that he could read Hebrew square characters, though not always correctly, as can be proved by his misreading of several Hebrew words which have hitherto puzzled students of the Qor\u0101n.\n\nOur task in studying the early history of Isl\u0101m consists chiefly in viewing Muhammed with a calm and dispassionate mind, with all possible rationalism, and complete absence of sentimentality. We then see how he from the very outset of his career worked in the most systematic manner, with great cleverness and real enthusiasm. We must never lose sight of the faculties he brought to bear on his work, the circumstances with which he had to reckon, and the character of the people he wished to impress. The Qor\u0101nic doctrine of divine revelation can be summed up in a few words: it is the transmission of a Biblical idea already in existence to a ground where the new faith was to spring up; all we have to do is to observe how it grew and developed in the new surroundings.\n\nH. Hirschfeld.\n\nThrough Asia. By Sven Hedin. (London: Methuen & Co., 1898.)\n\nThis is the latest and in many respects the most important contribution to our knowledge of the heart of Asia. We have here records of journeys of exploration made by a scientific traveller of learning and experience. In the Preface Dr. Sven Hedin gives a brief and comprehensive summary of his travels in Asia, and of the scientific work which he performed in the course of these travels, and also of the material and formation of his book. This very modest Preface is followed by an Introductory Chapter, in which we have an interesting r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the recorded travels and explorations in Tibet and Central Asia. Beginning with the visit to Tibet in the fourteenth century by Odorico di Pordenone, the sketch brings us down to Captain Bower's travels in Tibet and China in 1891\u20132.\nIn the next chapter we have a description of the traveller's original plan, and of the departures from it which circumstances compelled him to make. We have also particulars about his equipment and the expenses of his travels and explorations. The first part of his travels was through Russia to the Kirghiz steppes, on to Tashkend, and ultimately to the Pamirs. From the Russian Fort to the north-east of Fort Pamir the traveller set out on his first journey of exploration. His record of his attempts to ascend the great mountain range Mus-tagh-ata is extremely interesting. He went on to Kashgar and thence returned to Fort Pamir, from which he proceeded by a different route back to Kashgar. Thence he went on to Merket, from which he began his terrible journey across the great desert. The story of the traveller's sufferings and privations in this vast waste of sand is a thrilling one told in a plain and simple manner. After this we have his journey down the Khotan-daria and his return to Kashgar again.\n\nThe second volume begins with another visit to the Pamirs. Then we have the journey from Kashgar to Khotan, and thence on to Karashahr, with an interesting discussion on the Lop-nor question. Our traveller next takes us through North Tibet, over the Arka Tagh, to the Desert of Tsaidam. From the Mongolian Tsaidam he goes to the Tangut country, through it to the Koko-nor, thence on to Si-ning-foo, and at last to Peking the goal.\n\nIt is impossible to give in a short notice any fair idea of the vast and varied information about tribes and districts of Asia, little known or quite unknown, which these two volumes contain. The information, moreover, is imparted in a pleasant, affable manner, and the reader finds himself acquiring knowledge about Taghliks and Kirghizes, and wild asses and camels, and unknown mountains and rivers, and many other subjects, without any effort and with real enjoyment. There are numerous photographs by the author and sketches made or inspired by him; and the work is furnished with two large maps, and has an index.\n\nIn the parts of this remarkable and valuable treatise\nwhich treat of Chinese men and matters there are a few errors and peculiarities of transcription which may be briefly noticed for the benefit of the general reader. In vol. ii, p. 735, we read: \"The entire distance between Kashgar and Khotan has been divided by the Chinese into potai (2\u00bd mile distances).\" The author adds: \"The potai are indicated by flattened pyramids of clay, eighteen or twenty feet in height, and there are on an average ten such intervals or 'miles' between every two stations.\" This potai, as the author's illustration shows, is the Chinese P'ao-t'ai, commonly translated by Fort, and the term was probably applied in the above district to the Fire and Smoke Beacons used by the Chinese from the earliest times.\n\nThen at p. 748 we are told that jade is called 'Y\u00fc-tien.' But Y\u00fc (\u7389) -tien is the Chinese name for Khotan, and the name for jade is Y\u00fc (\u7389) simply.\n\nOn p. 783 we find the following statement:\u2014\"The same Chinese traveller whom I have just quoted, Shi Fa-hian, also journeyed in the seventh year of the reign of the Emperor Thai Tsung of the Thang dynasty from Khotan to Lop-nor.\" This is an unfortunate slip, and Dr. Sven Hedin forgot for the moment that the pilgrim who travelled in the reign of T'ang T'ai Tsung was the celebrated Yuan-chuang (Hiouen Thsang).\n\nThe 'Darin' of our traveller is the Ta-jen or 'Great Man,' 'His Excellency,' of other writers; and his jambaus (p. 932) are the Yuan-pao, the silver ingots, or 'shoes of aycee,' of people who live in China.\n\nT.

(Paris: Leroux, 1898.)\n\nThe Indian Parsis themselves have collected ample materials for a history of their residence and progress in India, from the best documents and authorities which still\nsurvive and are accessible. These materials are available for Anglo-Indians in the Gujarati Parsi Prak\u0101\u015bh (1878\u201388), compiled by Bahmanji Behramji Patel, and the Mumbai-no B\u0101h\u0101r (1858\u201384) by Ratanji Fr\u0101mji V\u0101ch\u0101; while the mere European can consult Dosabh\u0101\u012b Fr\u0101mji Kar\u0101k\u0101's English History of the Parsis (1858 or 1884). M. D. Menant has made full use of all these three authorities, besides consulting the statements of old travellers, Albiruni's Chronology of Ancient Nations, Briggs's Parsis, etc., and he has had the advantage of personal intercourse with many of the leading Parsis in Bombay at the present time. The result is a very correct and impartial, but sympathetic and picturesque, history of the Indian Parsis, and of their successful progress in education and enlightenment. This first part of the work confines itself chiefly to their civil life and progress, while a second part will be devoted to a consideration of their religious faith and duties, both past and present.\n\nThe Introduction gives a brief review of Parsi history, from the fall of the Sasanian empire in Ir\u0101n, owing to the defeat of Yazdagard at Nih\u0101vand, and his assassination at Marv in 650, down to the present time. The rapid conversion of the mass of the people to Isl\u0101mism; the retirement of some of the faithful Zoroastrians to Khur\u0101s\u0101n for less than a century, and thence to Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, for a short time; whence many of them sailed to Diu, near the Gulf of Cambay, where they stayed about a score of years before crossing the sea to Sanj\u0101n, then a populous commercial town, where they were allowed to settle (possibly about 716) by its Hindu ruler, J\u0101di R\u0101n\u0101, on certain conditions, which secured them full freedom of religion in return for conformity with Hindu law in civil matters. Here they built a place of worship in 721, according to tradition. Probably further immigrations took place; but the Parsis were much disturbed by the Musulm\u0101n conquest of Gujar\u0101t, though soon accommodating themselves to the change of government. Early European travellers found them settled as cultivators along the coast of Gujar\u0101t,\nand later as traders at Surat and Bombay. Near the end of the fifteenth century C\u0101ng\u0101 \u0100s\u0101, a rich and pious Parsi of Naos\u0101ri, sent a messenger to Ir\u0101n to obtain some religious information, and this appears to be the oldest correspondence between the Indian and Ir\u0101nian Parsis of which we find any documentary evidence surviving.\n\nRegarding the rapidity of the conversion of the Persian Zoroastrians to Isl\u0101mism, we may gather from Pahlavi writings that it was hardly so rapid as the conversion of the Romans, or the Anglo-Saxons, to Christianity. If we turn to the D\u0101dist\u0101n-i D\u0113nik,\u00b9 we find that its writer was M\u0101n\u016bshchihar, the executive high-priest of P\u0101rs and Kirm\u0101n, the director of the profession of priests and leader of the religion, who wrote his Epistles\u00b2 in 881, and his D\u0101dist\u0101n perhaps fifteen years earlier. This latter treatise contains replies to ninety-two religious questions, which had been propounded to him by some of his distant disciples, and which had lain two months unattended to, until he returned home to Sh\u012br\u0101z from a tour in the provinces. He mentions incidentally (Ibid., i, 6) that, notwithstanding the grievances of the religion, there still were controllers, priests, high-priests, judges, and other religious leaders in various quarters. This is certainly not the language of absolute despair, although it must have been written about A.Y. 235. In his Epistles, written A.Y. 250, \u201cSh\u012br\u016bz, Sirk\u0101n, Kirm\u0101n, R\u0101i, and Sarakhs are still mentioned as headquarters of the old faith, and we are told of assemblies at Sh\u012br\u0101z and among the Tughazghuz, the former of which appears to have had the chief control of religious matters in P\u0101rs, Kirm\u0101n, and the south, acting as a council to the high-priest of P\u0101rs and Kirm\u0101n, who was recognized as the leader of the religion. We also learn that the leaders of the Zoroastrians, if not their high-priests, were still in the habit of maintaining troops.\u201d\u00b3 It was probably more than a century later before the Ir\u0101nian Parsis were reduced to\n\n\u00b9 See Sacred Books of the East, vol. xviii, pp. 1-276.\n\u00b2 Ibid., pp. 277-386.\n\u00b3 S.B.E., vol. xviii, p. xxvii.\nthe scanty numbers reported by early European travellers in Persia, and which have only recently begun to increase. Whether the traditional date of the arrival of Parsi fugitives at Sanj\u0101n, which is not very well authenticated, be altogether compatible with this continued comfort and influence of those of their faith in Ir\u0101n, is therefore a matter for consideration.\n\nAfter dealing with the exodus of the Parsis from Persia, and the fate of the Zoroastrians who remained behind, M. Menant proceeds to describe the Indian Parsis and the progress which they have made\u2014their population, costumes, customs, and festivals; their domestic life, birth, and investiture with sacred shirt and girdle; their marriage and funerals; their pancayat and education; and their trade, literature, and politics.\n\nIn accordance with their agreement with the Hindu R\u0101j\u0101, the Parsis adopted Hindu dress and customs, so far as these were not inconsistent with their own religion; and the tendency of this adoption was, no doubt, to produce a closer conformity, in the course of time, than they intended originally, as in the case of infant marriage, which had not been a Zoroastrian practice, but which the Indian Parsis often adopted, even after the middle of this century. Since then, this custom has gradually disappeared, and is now practically extinct among those in Bombay. Other Hindu fashions of dress and manners have also given way to European customs and education. Whether the Hindu, Jewish, and Musulm\u0101n's dislike of the pig, which the Parsis had fully adopted, has yet disappeared seems doubtful, and M. Menant does not appear to allude to it. It was not a Zoroastrian prejudice, as appears from the pig being mentioned as a common domestic animal, in company with a dog, or a goat, in Sh\u0101yast-l\u0101-sh\u0101yast, ii, 58;\u00b9 also as a supply for a sacred feast, in M\u0101n\u016bshchihar's Epistle, I, viii, 3.\n\nWith regard, however, to all practices really enjoined by their religion, the Parsis are highly conservative, and find little difficulty in defending them. Even their mode of\n\n\u00b9 S.B.E., vol. v. p. 260.\ntreating the dead can be shown to be more conducive to sanitation than burial, provided the dokhma be far enough from dwellings, and the dead be not too numerous: two conditions which are quite as necessary in the case of a cemetery as in that of a dokhma. In Vend., viii, 16\u201318, instructions are given for expelling the fiend of corruption from the path along which a corpse has been carried. This precaution consisted in leading either a yellow dog with four eyes, or a white dog with yellow ears, along or across the path, a certain number of times, and in reciting certain spells; but it appears to be no longer practised. The difficulty of finding a dog with four eyes, even when it is assumed that two of them might be spots above the usual two eyes, must have been considerable; however, about ten years ago, there was a chocolate-coloured dog, living a few miles from Munich, something like a very large spaniel, and having a large white spot above each eye, who might have passed for the four-eyed dog, though not quite right in colour.\n\nWhen it is said that the Parsis are prohibited from fasting, as in Les Parsis, p. 92, it is necessary to observe that they do abstain from meat occasionally, and substitute fish (pp. 113, 166, 190); but this abstinence is not for the purpose of acquiring religious merit, as actual fasting and vociferous mourning for the dead are alike forbidden by their religion. It may also be noticed that the Avesta word asperena, quoted in p. 93, is equivalent to Skt. ap\u016br\u1e47a, \u2018imperfect, incomplete,\u2019 and is used as a noun for anything imperfect or immature: thus it means a lamb, or immature sheep, in Vend., iv, 48, and a rag, or imperfect cloth, in Vend., v, 60. The Pahlavi gloss, in the latter case, which has been read j\u016bjan, \u2018a dirham,\u2019 can also be read y\u016bgo = Pers. y\u016bk, \u2018a rag.\u2019\n\nInteresting features in M. Menant\u2019s work are the numerous illustrations, including thirty-two portraits and four family groups indicating the rapid change of education and costume.\n\n1 The Academy, 24th Sept., 1887, p. 207.\nsince 1860, which has certainly not increased the picturesqueness of Parsi attire. As a very favourable specimen of the old school, Fr\u0101mji K\u0101vasji Ban\u0101ji (1767\u20131851) is specially worthy of notice. At first a shipping agent and interpreter, he made two voyages to China before the end of last century, and a few years later engaged largely in the China trade on his own account, becoming the owner of several ships. Later on, for many years, he made experimental plantations in Salsette for improving the cultivation of grain and fruits, and continuing the growth of sugar-canes, mulberry-trees,\u00b9 and spices, which had already been introduced under European management, but with no greater success. He improved the water-supply of one district in Bombay, and did more to encourage the spread of English education among the natives than any other leader of his time. He himself had learned the language under difficulties, but spoke it fluently and well, though with a slightly foreign accent. To his patronage the Parsis owe the first translation of their most sacred books into Gujar\u0101ti; and he took a great interest in the first introduction of railways into India, but did not live to see the opening of the first section of railway line. He was a kind-hearted, liberal-minded, enterprising man, with much perseverance and energy; and the Parsis have good reason to be proud of him, as a worthy representative of their general character, and to be grateful to him for his foresight in striving to put a sound English education within the reach of every one of them. His portrait, which M. Menant has published, appears to be a correct likeness of his appearance in his latter days, so far as memory can be trusted after the lapse of half a century.\n\nThe most striking change that has taken place among the Parsis during the last thirty years has been the spread of European education and habits among the ladies, as a necessary supplement to the more general female vernacular education that commenced twenty years earlier. So long as the young men were imperfectly educated, scholastic\n\n\u00b9 Parsi Prak\u0101\u015bh, p. 561.\ninstruction of females was very wisely opposed by their elders, as likely to do more harm than good. But the rapid progress of the men soon made female education indispensable, and the male students began to take the matter into their own hands successfully, until they could find female teachers to undertake the continuance of the work. The result has been that, in 1892, only one-sixth of the Parsi females in Bombay between 14 and 24 years of age were classed as illiterate, while the illiterate Parsi males between the same ages were still one in eight; so the women had already nearly overtaken the men in the branches of education most generally useful.\n\nThe Zoroastrian woman has always enjoyed as much freedom as was compatible with implicit obedience to her parents and husband, as well as respect for her religion. This may be clearly seen from many passages in the Avesta; and the Pahlavi literature, which gives us a view of the opinions held in Sasanian times, tells much the same tale. Thus the Dinkard, book viii, informs us that a privileged wife can make a plaint for her husband, and also give evidence (ch. xx, 11), but not if a foreigner or not well-behaved, though any woman who is her own guardian can give evidence (\u00a7 29). A woman or child acquainted with the law is a better judge than a man unacquainted with it (xxii, 21). The priestship of a woman or child is also mentioned (xxix, 6). The limits of a wife's liberality and reverence are alluded to (xxx, 5). The religious controller of a daughter is her mother, but her father gives her in marriage, during the joint life of the parents (xliii, 10). The mother becomes guardian of the father, when necessary, if they have a son (\u00a7 18). And the performance of housewifery is taught by that wife who shall joyfully pay reverence to her husband; because her housewifery is for the satisfaction of the husband, the satisfaction is through her reverence, and the reverence arises through joy (Dk. IX, lxvi, 10).\n\nThe laws of inheritance also, which are detailed\n\n---\n\n1 The Parsis, p. 354.\n2 Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxxvii.\nin the D\u0101dist\u0101n-i D\u0113n\u012bk, liv and lxii, give twice as much to the wife, or any blind or crippled child, as to each healthy child or dependent relation. Further, the Persian Riv\u0101yat of K\u0101\u016bs K\u0101m\u0101n (about A.D. 1553) provides, in case of a debtor's death, that the debts and his privileged widow's dowry shall be the first charges upon his estate, and then his widow and children share the remainder according to law.\n\nThe seclusion of their women, borrowed from the Musulm\u0101ns, was probably felt as an inconvenience by Parsi men long before they ventured to discontinue it. I was told, by a Parsi of the middle class, more than fifty years ago, that he had driven out with his wife and family one afternoon, when he was disconcerted by seeing the first Sir Jamshedji Jijibh\u0101\u012b passing in his carriage. But Sir Jamshedji found an opportunity, a few days later, to congratulate him upon his good sense in breaking through the absurd custom of always avoiding his wife in public.\n\nM. Menant mentions the attachment of the Parsis to England (Les Parsis, p. 363), and this loyalty to British rule has often been noticed, especially by foreigners who have taken the trouble to become personally acquainted with really influential Parsis; but those who remark this loyalty seldom try to account for it. To a certain extent it may be due to both the British and the Parsis being foreigners in India and few in number, with the same interest in peaceable internal government, which no native dynasty has ever been able to maintain for any length of time; and the Parsis have had too much experience of native governments already to wish for a repetition of such incompetence. Under these circumstances, Parsi loyalty certainly shows that they have no real cause for dissatisfaction with British rule. But the chief reason for their contentment is probably the similarity of character between the average Briton and Parsi. In both we may generally trace the same enterprise and self-reliance, the same fondness for liberty and dislike of official interference, the same perseverance and self-control, and the same love of justice and hatred of tyranny.\nand deceitful servility. May they long retain these attributes of character, and not give way to effeminacy or corruption, which are too often the effects of rapid progress in the material comforts of civilization.\n\nE. W.

They are intended to facilitate the comparative study of the various systems of colonial administration, and are planned on very generous lines with a view to that end.\n\nLes Fonctionnaires Coloniaux contains the administrative regulations touching the personnel of the colonial establishments of France and Spain. The latter regulations will have, it is to be feared, little more than a historical interest after the events of this year, but the former, which occupy about four-fifths of this volume, are likely to grow in importance. It would be interesting, did space permit, to compare them in detail with the regulations of the India Office and Colonial Office of this country. One point, which would strike even a superficial observer, is the much greater minuteness and complexity of the French rules. Another is the provision, under them, of a systematic course of instruction in Eastern languages, a matter in regard to which our own country still lags most woefully behind every other nation. A third is the great consideration shown by the French Government to its officials, not indeed in paying\nthem very high salaries, but in allowing frequent and ample vacations and leave, with special regard to the climatic conditions of the countries in which they serve.\n\n*Le R\u00e9gime Foncier aux Colonies* contains the regulations relating to the disposal and acquisition of waste lands in the British Indian provinces of Bombay, Bengal, the North-West Provinces and Oudh, the Punjab, Burma, Assam, and Coorg, and the land regulations of the German Colonies and Protectorates of East Africa, Togo and the Cameroons, South-West Africa, New Guinea, and the Marshall Islands. The first part of the volume (which relates to British India and occupies about five-eighths of the whole) is furnished with an introductory memorandum by Mr. B. H. Baden-Powell, C.I.E., a retired member of the Indian Civil Service, who has also added explanatory notes to each section, which will be of great assistance in rendering these somewhat complex regulations intelligible to the unofficial and especially the foreign reader. The general administrative system of British India is briefly sketched, some indication is given of the circumstances peculiar to each of the provinces here dealt with, and the native and other technical terms occurring in the text of the regulations are duly explained.\n\nThe second part of the work, which deals with the German colonies, is annotated in a somewhat similar way, but by no means as fully, by Mr. H. Herzog. The German regulations here given have, however, a somewhat wider scope than those reprinted in the British Indian part, including as they do such subjects as compulsory expropriation for public purposes, purchase of lands from native occupiers or owners (which is placed under considerable restrictions and in some cases forbidden), and a very complete system of registration of title. Seeing that the whole of this German legislation dates no further back than the year 1887, and that most of it is still more recent, it must be admitted that it has already accumulated into a relatively considerable bulk.\n\nIt is noticeable that a large part of this legislation consists of Imperial Ordinances and Orders of the Imperial Chancellor\nmade in pursuance of them, comparatively little being apparently delegated to any local legislative or administrative authority in the colonies themselves except the filling in of details. As these regulations, however, are scrupulously exact and minute, this latter function is perhaps of greater relative importance than would appear at first sight. The general scheme of the whole system for the ascertainment of proprietary rights and the demarcation of Crown lands does not differ fundamentally from that with which British Indian and Colonial officials are familiar.\n\nThese volumes deserve the careful attention of all persons who are interested in the comparative study of administrative methods, and of every Government which cares to profit by the experiences of other nations.\n\nC. O. Blagden.\n\nLe Livre des Beaut\u00e9s et des Antith\u00e8ses attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 Abu Othm\u00e2n Amr b. Bahr al-Dj\u00e2hiz de Basra. Texte arabe, publi\u00e9 par G. van Vloten. 8vo; pp. xxiii, 382. (Leyden: Brill, 1898.)\n\nWe cannot but hail with satisfaction the publication, by a European scholar, of the first of the writings attributed to Al Jahiz. It is somewhat strange that \"the staring\" leader of the Basrian Mu'tazilites did not engage the special attention of students of Arabic literature before, although attention is called to his name in numerous works on the most heterogeneous subjects. There were few subjects relating to the religious, social, or literary life of his age on which (if we may trust the native litterateurs) Al Jahiz did not have a word to say. He continually endeavoured to root out antiquated views and prejudices, and impregnated many younger authors with the spirit of his criticism. The writings attributed to him are legion. The MS. Cod. Brit. Mus. Or. 3,138 alone is composed of abstracts of not less than twenty-seven essays bearing his name, but Professor Rieu has already remarked in his Catalogue that only two of them are mentioned by H\u00e1jji Khalfa. The uncertainty\nregarding the authenticity of many of the works is not of recent date. Ibn Abi Us\u00e9ibia, in mentioning an essay by the famous physician Ar R\u0101zi (which was written as an answer to an attack of Al J\u0101hiz against medical aid, i, p. 316), says: a treatise 'attributed' to Al J\u0101hiz. Rather much has been made of his complaint that his talents remained unappreciated, and that he was obliged to adopt a pseudonym in order to be read.\u00b9 This must be taken cum grano salis. For it stands not only in glaring contrast to the flattering remarks passed on him by the author of the Fihrist (p. 44) and Ibn Khalliq\u0101n (transl. by De Slane, ii, p. 405), but it is certain that other authors used his name as a hall-mark for their own productions.\n\nDr. van Vloten has clearly demonstrated that this was the case with the book under consideration. He shows that the bulk of the book did not originate from Al J\u0101hiz' pen, but was compiled some time after his death either by, or with the assistance of the \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0646 of, Al-Baihaqi. Fortunately this circumstance does not diminish its literary value, and cannot deprive it of a prominent place in Arabic Adab literature. It is exceedingly rich in material of the most variegated kind, its object being to discuss the good and bad points of a number of propositions, both sides of the question being illustrated with tales, anecdotes, proverbs, and verses. The last-named two groups are of particular importance. The book abounds in fine observations, and contains many details which add to our knowledge of Arab culture, history, and literature. It is noteworthy that with respect to proverbs Al J\u0101hiz seems to have been regarded as a special authority. Al Tha\u02bf\u0101libi in his \u062b\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u0648\u0628 (see H. Kh., ii, p. 493, and Cod. Brit. Mus. Add., 9,558) quotes his name continually, often several times on one page. Unfortunately he seldom mentions the work from which he quotes, e.g., \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0628\u0648\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639 (fol. 54v) and \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u063a\u0644\u0627\u0644 (fol. 67v). Many\n\n\u00b9 See Pr\u00e9face, p. xi; and Goldziher, \"Abhandlungen zur arab. Philologie,\" p. 141; Brockelmann, \"Geschichte der arab. Literatur.\"\nquotations are evidently taken from the \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0648\u0627\u0646, although the work is not named, and I have no opportunity of verifying this. As Dr. van Vloten has promised to deal further with the J\u0101hiz literature, he will probably clear up much that is still uncertain concerning it, and possibly also include the quotations in Al Tha'alibi's work in his researches.\n\nAnother prominent feature of the book are the sayings handed down by Moslim traditions on behalf of Muhammed. Among these, of some interest is the answer he is supposed to have given to a believer who asked him to pray for a pious wife for him, \"Allah,\" Muhammed replied, \"announces in heaven which husbands and wives are destined for each other.\" Compare with this a passage in the Talmud (S\u014d\u1e6d\u0101, fol. 27o): \"R. Jeh\u016bdah says: 'Forty days before the creation of the embryo a heavenly voice calls out: 'So and so's daughter shall be given to such and such a man.'\" The saying of Al \u1e24asan al Basri (p 162, l. 18) is all but a literal rendering of a passage in Ab\u014dth, iii, 1.\n\nThe verse of Al \u1e24uteia (p. 38), said by Ka'b al A\u1e25b\u0101r to be based on the command of gratitude given in the \"T\u014dr\u0101,\" has been fully dealt with by Goldziher in Z.D.M.G., vol. xlvii, p. 499. Another quotation preceding this one, also supposed to be from the \"T\u014dr\u0101,\" and bearing on the same subject, is equally spurious. The proverb, p. 168, l. 19, should be compared with Eccles., ix, 4.\n\nThe list of trades and professions exercised by the Qoreish chiefs in Mecca (p. 165) is characteristically not placed in the chapter on the \"merits of gaining a livelihood,\" but in that one which deals with the disadvantage of ancestral pride and self-glorification. This list is nevertheless of great archaeological interest, and gives at a glance a clearer insight into ancient Arabic culture than many lengthy accounts of traditionists and historiographers coloured by racial and religious prejudice.\nA considerable but not less interesting portion of the book, comprising a series of chapters, is devoted to women of various characters and stations. The lead is taken by the 'mourning' ones, and no one will be surprised to see that a relatively large space is devoted to the poetess Al Khaus\u0101. The verses accompanying the anecdotes concerning her form a welcome supplement to those published by N\u00f6ldeke, Beitraege zur Kenntniss der Poesie, etc., p. 181. Both sides of the marriage question are illustrated by anecdotes, proverbs, and poems. The chapter on \"the tricks of women\" contains some pretty tales. As to the superscription \u0643\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621 (\u0645\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621) and the parallel proverb in Al Tha\u02bf\u0101libi's above-mentioned work (fol. 59v), see Qor., xii, 28, 31. The various forms of rivalry and jealousy occupy a larger place in the book than any other subject. Altogether, these portions are full of fine pieces of composition. The chapter on Persian feasts is particularly instructive. Rather curious is the report that (p. 362) when the Neir\u016bz (New Year's Day) fell on a Saturday the King sent to the Ras al Jal\u016bth (\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0648\u062b), Exiliarch of the Jews in the Ir\u0101q) a present of 4,000 dirhams, for no other reason than that this was an old custom. Here, again, it is interesting to note that Al Tha\u02bf\u0101libi (i.e., fol. 63v) mentions the \u0631\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a, but with the misapprehension that meant the real head of the Jal\u016bth, \u0631\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a. The word \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a is in so far the cause of further confusion, as in Qor., ii, 250, it stands for Goliath. The conclusions which might be drawn from the consonance of the two terms would lead too far. The discussion of the Persian feasts, and the concluding one on 'the Presents,' show to what extent Persian customs had crept in upon the life of good Moslims under the Abbaside rule.\n\nThe edition is done with the care and skill Dr. van Vloten has taught us to expect from him. His treatment of the poetic passages deserves special praise. To the list of misprints I should like to add\u2014p. 60, l. 1, v. \u0637\u0648\u0627\u0644 and\nAn index of names would have been not only a welcome but even a necessary appendix to make the edition a ready book of reference.\n\nH. Hirschfeld.\n\nGrundriss der Iranischen Philologie: V, Neupersische Litteratur. Von Dr. C. H. Eth\u00e9. (Strassburg, 1897.)\n\nWith the exception of his Catalogues of the Bodleian and the India Office MSS. and some articles in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, nearly all Dr. Eth\u00e9's contributions to the study of Persian literature have been written in German, and lie buried in the depths of German periodicals, always more or less inaccessible to English readers, and now mostly out of print. Few English students are fortunate enough to possess copies of Dr. Eth\u00e9's studies on the earliest period of Persian poetry\u2014his papers on the forerunners of R\u016bdagi, on R\u016bdagi and his contemporaries, on Kis\u0101i, on the Quatrains of Ab\u016b Sa'id bin Ab\u016b-l-Khair, and on those of Avicenna. His paper on N\u0101sir bin Khusrau, which gave a masterly solution of the problems suggested by the poems of that author, was read at the Sixth International Congress of Orientalists, but is now only accessible in the voluminous report of the transactions of that Congress. His latest work, which forms the subject of this notice, does not seem hitherto to have attracted in this country the attention which it deserves. It quite supersedes the older authorities such as Hammer's \"Redekunste Persiens\" and Ouseley's \"Persian Poets.\" The first portion of the book is devoted to the poets, who are treated of according to the class to which they belong\u2014Epic, Lyric, Didactic, or Mystical; and the account of each of the most notable poets is followed by an excellent bibliography. The same plan is followed in the case of the prose-writers, and probably it was this portion of his work which cost Dr. Eth\u00e9 most trouble, since the ordinary Tazkiras do not, generally speaking, pay much attention to prose-writers. The only regret one feels is\nthat Dr. Eth\u00e9 was not able to enrich his notices of the poets by specimens of their verses, as Hammer did, but this was, of course, impossible in the limited space allotted to him by the editors of the \"Iranische Philologie.\"\n\nE. H. W.\n\nHittiter und Armenier, von P. Jensen. Mit zehn lithographischen Schrifttafeln und einer \u00dcbersichtskarte. (Strassburg: Karl J. Tr\u00fcbner, 1898.)\n\nA book well printed, and on thick paper, of xxvi and 256 pages, ten double-page plates giving values of characters, and a map, enables Professor Jensen to lay before the public his carefully, learnedly, and elaborately reasoned-out system for the decipherment of the so-called Hittite inscriptions, which have so greatly puzzled and exercised the minds of students and scholars ever since they were brought clearly to the notice of the learned world by Dr. Wright.\n\nThere is no doubt that the system of Professor Jensen, following, as it does, that of Grotefend in the decipherment of the Persian Cuneiform inscriptions, is the best means of penetrating the secret of this strange writing, and one cannot but desire that such perseverance as the author of this book has shown may turn out to have led him on the right path. Even if half the values that he professes to have made out prove to be correct, or approximately so, he is deserving not only of the gratitude but also of the thanks of all those to whom Oriental archaeology is a thing of importance and worthy of attention.\n\nIt is to be hoped, then, that the learned Professor, who has brought together so much material bearing on the subject, has met with at least some measure of success. The immense difficulties that attend the work of decipherment in the domain of \"Hittology,\" however, will be well realized when one sees what one so well equipped for the fray as Professor Jensen has been able to produce:\u2014\nHITTITER UND ARMENIER.\n\nINSCRIPTION FROM HAM\u0100.\n\nLine 1.

(?), the king.\n\n(The reference-marks to the numerous notes and some few variants have been omitted as tending to confuse the transcription and, to a certain extent, the translation.)\n\nIf Professor Jensen has really got so far as to give with any certainty the meanings of such words as are translated above without queries, he has without any doubt made some progress, but, to put it mildly, his method of transcription is a very teasing one, and it is something of a labour to find one's way through it. The value of the book would have been greatly increased, and a great deal of trouble\nsaved to the reader, if the inscriptions translated had, in every case, been accompanied by the original text. The original characters are, in fact, absolutely necessary to enable the reader to see clearly which of them the author regards as certain or otherwise in his work.\n\nOther inscriptions treated of are from Ham\u0101, Jer\u0101bis (\"inscriptions of the kings of Kargami(\u0161) or Kar(i)gami(\u0161)\"), Mar'a\u0161 (\"inscription of a king of Gurgum\"), the lion-hunt inscription of Arslantepe near Ordasu (\"inscription of Mutalu of Comagene and Melitene\"), inscriptions from Izgin, G\u00fcr\u00fcn, Cilicia, Bulgarmaden, Ivriz, Bor, K\u00f6litolu, Beik\u00f6i, Agrak, Fraktin, Chammanene (?) near Bogazkeui, Karabel, and a number of seal inscriptions. It will thus be seen that there is a sufficient amount of material to work upon.\n\nIt is somewhat startling to see that, in his rendering of the so-called \"boss of Tarcondemos\" (generally read Tarq\u016b-dimme), Professor Jensen reads the name TAR-BI-BI-uass\u00edmi or TAR-KU-uass\u00edmi. He may be right, but his reading seems to me to be hardly in accordance with the divisions of the characters in the Babylonian text, though, as the text in question is very badly engraved, almost any division of the characters is possible. With regard to this object, I am not by any means satisfied, myself, that the Assyrian characters are genuine.\n\nAccording to the author, there are various helps to the deciphering of these inscriptions. A diagonal stroke is a doubtful \"word beginner and closer,\" whilst another, generally written like sanseriph IL, certainly (according to the author) has this power. Another, a double group, \"marks once the beginning of an inscription.\" Besides these, there is a 'word-closer,' a 'word-divider,' a nominative sign, and (doubtful) a determinative for ideograms and signs of words.\n\nIt is a valuable work if the conclusions it contains be correct. One cannot help wishing, however, for a sufficiently long bilingual.\n\nT. G. Pinches.\nEGYPT EXPLORATION FUND. Archaeological Reports. Edited by F. Ll. Griffith, M.A. 1898.\n\nThis is a small volume of 70 pages, with illustrations and maps, the letterpress being contributed by Professor Flinders Petrie, Messrs. Clarke, Grenfell, Kenyon, Crum, and the Editor. It is an excellent report, and not only shows what the Fund has done during the year, but also what has been done in the domain of Egyptology in general during the same period. The plate facing p. 7 gives an excellent reproduction of the fragment of a sculptured mace-head, representing an Egyptian king of the second dynasty opening canal works. This interesting object was found at Hieraconpolis.\n\nT. G. Pinches.\n\nA GRAMMAR OF THE PERSIAN LANGUAGE IN MODERN SYRIAC. Compiled and translated by the Rev. F. F. Irving. Printed at the Press of the Archbishop of Canterbury's Mission, \u00dcrmi (Urumiyya), Persia, A.D. 1898.\n\nWhatever view may be taken as to the utility or desirability of missions which have for their object the conversion of Muhammadans, all must sympathize with those which devote their energies to the strengthening, building up in knowledge and righteousness, and education of the native Churches in the East. Amongst these, the excellent work done by the Archbishop of Canterbury's Mission to the Nestorians of \u00dcrmi (Urumiyya), in the Persian province of \u0100dharb\u0101yj\u0101n (Atropatene), has long been recognized and appreciated. From the Mission Press there established many Syriac works have been issued, but hitherto nothing in Persian. The Persian Grammar, compiled and translated into modern Syriac by the Rev. F. F. Irving, which has just been printed and published in \u00dcrmi, marks, therefore, a new departure. The writer of this brief notice, having received a copy of the work in question, desires to call the attention of Syriac scholars\nto it; but, being himself unacquainted with Syriac, can do little more than chronicle its appearance and offer his congratulations to those untiring and devoted workers to whose beneficent activity it owes its existence.\n\nThe little volume comprises 240 pages of $17 \\times 10\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, and consists of (1) a sketch of Persian grammar, treating of the different parts of speech in order, of the inflexion and composition of words, and of Arabic locutions employed in Persia; (2) an account of the Calendar (Persian and Arabic, Turkish cycle of years, *hijra* computation, and conversion of Mu\u1e25ammadan to Christian dates, and *vice versa*); (3) dialogues in Persian and modern Syriac; forms of address employed in letters, specimens of letters, petitions, bonds, legal documents, leases, etc.; (4) tables of money, weights, and measures; (5) list of Syriac verbs, with Persian equivalents. The work is based chiefly on the late Professor E. H. Palmer's *Persian Grammar*, Captain Wilberforce Clarke's *Persian Manual*, and M. Kazimirski's excellent *Dialogues et Vocabulaire Fran\u00e7ais-Persans*. Its general plan and conception appear good; its utility is indisputable; and though there are a good many misprints in the Persian and some Indianisms (no doubt derived from Captain Wilberforce Clarke's *Manual*) in the dialogues, this could hardly be otherwise in so novel an attempt. Revision of the proofs of the next edition by a well-educated Persian *m\u012brz\u0101*, and a more exclusive use of Kazimirski's work, will easily remedy these defects in the second edition, which, it may be hoped, will soon be called for.\n\nE. G. B.\n\n**Archaeological Survey of Egypt**, edited by F. Ll. Griffith, M.A., F.S.A. Sixth Memoir. A Collection of Hieroglyphs: A Contribution to the History of Egyptian Writing, by the Editor. (London: Offices of the Egypt Exploration Fund, 1898.)\n\nThe ever active Editor of the publications of the Egypt Exploration Fund (from whose pen comes the Annual\nReport, also noticed this quarter) gives us, in this work, a scientific description, based on new material, of a number of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, of which drawings from the hands of Mr. H. Carter, Mr. Blackden, Miss P. F. E. Paget, and Miss A. Pirie, are printed in colour at the end.\n\nThe plates are nine in number, with a total of 193 figures, and show the various objects depicted in the Egyptian Hieroglyphic system in what the Egyptian sculptors and scribes conceived to be their natural colours, and with greater attention to detail than the majority of Egyptian inscriptions show. The originals, which were found in various sites in Egypt, are of the Twelfth and Eighteenth Dynasties.\n\nInteresting is the well-drawn figure of a 'pin-tailed duck,' which, though in modern conventional writing identical with that for the goose, was, in reality, a quite distinct sign. It is this character which stands for 'son,' generally written , and having the pronunciation of si or se. In the Babylonian name-lists it is reproduced by si, as in \u1e62iptahi', or \u1e62ipta\u1e25u, 'son of (the god) Ptah'; \u1e62ih\u016bru, 'son of Horus,' etc. The duck which is represented is a brightly-coloured bird with two long feathers in its tail, hence the name given to it.\n\nThe character , from its form in the more carefully-drawn and coloured hieroglyph given in the plates, is described as being probably the opening of a drain with a stand to support it (p. 63).\n\nThe well-known character , which generally means 'good,' has long been supposed to be the representation of a lute. As, however, it is drawn in these coloured pictures of hieroglyphics with the same markings on the oval part as are found on the hieroglyph for 'heart,' and the long\nneck of the object has a number of horizontal lines upon it, Mr. Spurrel and Professor Petrie suggest that it may represent the heart and tracheae. This explanation, it is pointed out, would then agree with the description given in the Hieroglyphics of Hieropollo (\"absurd inventions,\" mostly), where it is said that \"a man's heart hung from the windpipe means the mouth of a good man.\"\n\nAs is also common knowledge, the 'chicken,' \ud83d\udc14, does not represent the young of our own familiar barn-fowl, but some other bird of the same family. Mr. Griffith suggests, with some show of probability, that it is the young of the quail, possibly hatched from the eggs that were found abundantly in the harvest-field.\n\nOne could go on, however, quoting interesting identifications from this attractive book far beyond the limits of our space. It is well got up, and clearly printed, but would have been handier in a smaller form. It is difficult to over-estimate the good work done by the Egypt Exploration Fund in printing the results of the discoveries that are being constantly made in Egypt by their explorers. It is work that deserves the support of all who have the recovery of the lost records of Egypt at heart, and Mr. Griffith has rendered a real service to science in the compilation of this volume.\n\nT. G. Pinches.\n\nM. Edouard Naville publishes, in the Revue Arch\u00e9ologique, an interesting article upon a small wooden box with ornamentation in Egyptian style, which the Rev. Mr. MacGregor has added to his collection at Tamworth. This object is of a semi-cylindrical form, is divided within into two compartments, and has a flat lid running lengthwise in a groove made to receive it. The interesting thing about this object, however, is the broad band carved in relief with representations of wild animals\u2014a lion carrying off a cloven-hoofed animal on his back, a dog running and apparently in the act of barking, a calf or steer, also running, a lioness devouring\nan ibex, and another mutilated design seemingly of the nature of a struggle between a lion and a bull.\n\nM. Naville sees in this carving a style of art similar to that of a plaque of ivory found by M. Perrot at Spata, and printed by him in his *Histoire de l'Art*, vol. vi, p. 826. He points out, moreover, that, whilst the dog recalls the bas-reliefs of A\u0161\u0161ur-bani-apli where the hunting-dogs are shown, the lioness devouring an ibex has an absolutely similar motif in the art of Mycene. He thinks, however, that the author of these sculptures, though he may have been a Greek, was not domiciled in Greece nor in the Isles of the Aegean, but somewhere in Syria.\n\nPictures of these and of other objects of art of the same nature found in Egypt accompany this interesting article.\n\nThe veteran Professor J. Oppert is in his element in the paper \"Alexandre \u00e0 Babylone\" that he contributes to the *Comptes Rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres*, this subject giving him opportunity to touch upon many chronological questions of interest. More interesting, however, to the general reader, is his translation of an inscription of the reign of Alexander that refers to the temple at Babylon known as E-sagila. It records a gift, by Baruqaa (so I read instead of Maruqa) through his servant Nanzanu, of ten manas of silver as tithe, being his contribution towards the clearing away of the rubbish of the temple preparatory to its restoration, as recorded by Strabo, whom the author of the paper quotes. This work, begun by Alexander, was never finished, for the death of the Greek ruler occurred shortly afterwards, and none of his successors thought it worth while to continue it, especially as it was a labour of great magnitude.\n\nThe name of E-sagila in the Aramaic docket (as I have already noted in this Journal) ought to be read with two yods at the beginning (\u05d0\u05b5\u05e1\u05b8\u05d2\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc, (Y)e-sangil). With regard to the spelling of the name of the king, the mutilation of the last two characters preserved renders it rather doubtful,\nbut there is great probability that the real reading is \n\\[ \\text{\u0391-lik-sa-an-dar-ri-is}, \\]\na corruption of the Greek '\u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, as mentioned by \nProfessor Oppert in his note, p. 419. The veteran Assyriologist may be congratulated on having written a learned \nand most interesting paper.\n\nT. G. PINCHES.\n\nA Glossary of the Aramaic Inscriptions. By Stanley A. \nCook, B.A., etc. pp. viii + 127. (Cambridge: at the \nUniversity Press, 1898.)\n\nThe preparation of such a glossary as Mr. S. A. Cook \nhas produced by the diligent use of the time that he could \nspare from other work needs no elaborate justification: an \nexamination of the private notes of Semitic scholars would \nprobably reveal that not a few have had to make more or \nless extensive lists for their own use. Nor is there any \nmore need to justify its publication by the Cambridge Press: \nit is not a superfluous addition to the Semitic scholar's \nworkshop, nothing of the kind having appeared before; \nit is useful, few, if any, having time to construct for mere \nprivate use a record at all so complete.\n\nThe importance of a study of Semitic (as of other) \ninscriptions is becoming more and more recognized. Un-\nfortunately it is a branch of study difficult to prosecute, \nbecause, apart from the great libraries, many of the \npublications containing the texts are not generally accessible. \nWithin the last thirty years over 1,100 Aramaic inscrip-\ntions have been made available for study.\n\nIn 1868\u201377 the Comte de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 published 150 Aramaic \ninscriptions from Palmyra; in 1875 Morltmann published other \n93; in 1885 Euting published still 40 more, and 70 Nabataean \nAramaic inscriptions from Arabia; in 1887 Euting published 12 \nmore from Palmyra; in 1889 the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et \nBelli-s-Lettres began the issue of the second part of the Corpus \nInscriptionum Semiticarum, with 112 (Nos. 1\u2013112) Aramaic inscrip-\ntions from Babylonia, etc., 34 (Nos. 122\u2013155) from Egypt, and\nGLOSSARY OF THE ARAMAIC INSCRIPTIONS.\n\n161 Nabataean; in 1891 Euting published 677 from the Sinaitic Peninsula; and in 1898 D. H. M\u00fcller published over 40 from Palmyra. In addition to these, not a few inscriptions are to be found in the pages of the various Journals and Proceedings of learned societies, most of which are enumerated by Mr. Cook.\n\nOf course, these inscriptions have been diligently studied. Euting's two volumes have indexes of proper names, one of which includes also some words of the language. Between the issue of these two volumes Ledrain, in 1887, published a useful Dictionnaire des Noms Propres Palmyr\u00e9niens. D. H. M\u00fcller's Die altsemitischen Inschriften von Sendschirli (1893) contains a vocabulary. Still, there was nothing whatever of the nature of a general dictionary until the appearance of this glossary of Mr. Cook.\n\nIn the preface (pp. v-viii) he mentions the chief collections of inscriptions used, states what has been done already by other scholars, and describes the general aim of the present work.\n\nThe introduction (pp. 1-10) contains a convenient classification of the available Aramaic inscriptions, according to their source, as coming from what we may call\u2014(1) a north-east district, stretching from Babylonia to Asia Minor; (2) a south-west district, viz. Egypt; (3) the intervening district. To this middle region belong by far the most of the published Aramaic inscriptions, viz.: (a) the Nabataean, (b) the Palmyrene, and (c) the Sinaitic. The bibliography and the chronological limits of each of these groups are briefly stated. At the end is a list of abbreviations.\u00b9\n\nThe glossary itself (pp. 11-127), a laborious piece of work containing over 2,000 entries (as compared with some 500\n\n\u00b9 We think that readers who at first object to the very free use of abbreviations and symbols will in time come to appreciate them. We do not like, however, the hybrid 'cfs.'; it should be cfs. or eft. (if Pehlevi has to be learned it does not need to be copied). Certain readers would find it convenient to be told that the frequent references to Ibn Doreid are to the Kit\u0101b el-Istik\u0101k, ed. W\u00fcstenfeld. A symbol indicating the origin of the inscriptions cited merely by numbers would have been useful. In the article [21], e.g., printing 158N for 158 would have informed the reader that 158, as well as N7, is a Nabataean inscription.\nin Ledrain's *Dictionnaire*), rests on the work of the copiers and editors of inscriptions and on critical discussions founded thereon. The usefulness of the book consists in its bringing to a focus under each word in alphabetical order, with a constant exercise of judgment and critical care, whatever relates to it in the publications enumerated in the preface. A first compilation of such a kind is entitled to lenient treatment, which will be willingly accorded. All we are justified in looking for is (1) as close an approach as possible to completeness of record; (2) an honest attempt to discriminate between what is certain and what is doubtful in decipherment and interpretation; and (3) accuracy of statement.\n\n(1) As for the first of these, completeness: Mr. Cook could not, of course, be expected to go behind published inscriptions; he believes he has included all such except certain (e.g. in some of the earlier numbers of the *ZDMG*) which, he thinks, have not been critically enough edited.\n\n(2) Uncertainty of decipherment is indicated by a point over the Hebrew letter; conjectural restoration, by square brackets. Mr. Cook sometimes controls the decipherment of the editors, from the context, or from an examination of the facsimiles. In the matter of interpretation he does not aim at being independent: he has followed, as he tells us, the editors of the various texts. Later critical investigations, however, have been laid under contribution, and we find now and then a suggestion that is new.\n\n(3) The reader will wish to know most of all what degree of accuracy has been attained. As the book professes to be in principle a digest of the work of others, only extended use of it as an index can reveal how far it is trustworthy. We may say at once, however, that such cross references as we have had occasion to verify have been found correct,\\(^1\\) and that, where some questionable point has led us to compare the original, the same is true of the citation of\n\n\\(^1\\) Occasional slight discrepancies between a note of reference and the place referred to (e.g. \\(n\\) on p. 11, third article, compared with \\(n\\) on p. 52) are almost unavoidable and will mislead no one.\nIt is naturally to the strictly Aramaic part of the work that the compiler has devoted most attention. Where the decipherment is so often uncertain, and the meaning doubtful, the choice between rival explanations is often difficult, and we cannot expect always to agree with the result. It is a pity that practical considerations forbid a fuller treatment. The illustrations from Arabic, Assyrian, and ancient Egyptian are generally taken from the same source as the inscriptions themselves, and (apart from misprints and slips of the pen) criticism of them does not touch Mr. Cook.\n\n1 On p. 42, however, under \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8\u05b0\u05d5\u05bc, 120 should be 124; and on p. 63, under \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05db\u05b6\u05dc, 362 should be 682. Moreover, \u05de in \u05de\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d7\u05b7\u05ea and in \u05de\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d7\u05b7\u05ea, on pp. 22 and 97, should be \u05de. The facsimile is quite unambiguous.\n\n2 It is not worth while pointing out such things as omissions or misplacements of \u05de; but it may be of use to some readers to correct the following misprints:\u2014on p. 13 \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8\u05b0\u05d5\u05bc for \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8\u05b0\u05d5\u05bc of CIS\u2014i.e. \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8\u05b0\u05d5\u05bc; on p. 19 \u05d7\u05b2\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d0\u05b5\u05e3 for \u05d7\u05b2\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05d0\u05b5\u05e3 of Euting; on p. 27 \u05d0\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 for \u05d0\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9; on p. 37 \u05d9\u05b4\u05d2\u05b0\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9 for \u05d9\u05b4\u05d2\u05b0\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9; on p. 43 \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9 for \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9; on p. 53 \u05d7\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9 for \u05d7\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9; on p. 55 \u05d7\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9 (following a misprint in De Vog\u00fc\u00e9) for \u05d7\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9, and \u05d7\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9 for \u05d7\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9; on p. 88 'Obaisat (after CIS) for 'Obaisat; on p. 93 \u05e4\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05df for \u05e4\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05df; on p. 96 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8 for \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8; on p. 97 \u05e4\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d6 for \u05e4\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d6; on p. 111 \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d9\u05b5\u05d9 for \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d9\u05b5\u05d9; (on p. 113 is a rare form, not an error for \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d9\u05b5\u05d9;) on p. 115 \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc for \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc; and on p. 119 \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8 for \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8, and \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8 for \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8.\n\n3 Sometimes, however, the effort to be concise leads to obscurity or misstatement: on p. 19, under \u05e0\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05e7\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0, N\u00f6ldeke's explanation \"one who is cut from the body of his mother\" is not an alternative translation of \u05d4\u05de\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e8, but a translation of \u05d4\u05de\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e8; in the same article Leps. 86 refers to Denkm\u00e4ler aus \u00c4gypten, Abth. vi (Band xi), Tafel 14-21; on p. 22 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 and 'nose' are alternatives, not equivalents; on p. 56 the juxtaposition of \u05d7\u05b2\u05e8\u05b7\u05d2\u05b0\u05dc and Heb. \u05d7\u05b2\u05e8\u05b7\u05d2\u05b0\u05dc suggests to the unwary reader that the Arabic word is known in the sense of 'grasshopper'; on p. 105, if 'to place, to set' be correct, \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d3 should be \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d3. On the other hand, there seems to be a misapprehension on p. 38 in the J.R.A.S. 1899.\nWe hope he will have the satisfaction of having his book much used while it is still up to date. It is well printed and well bound. Perhaps the leaves were left uncut because it was thought likely that scholars would wish interleaved copies.\n\nThis glossary will materially facilitate the Ausbeutung of the inscriptions. The brief introduction will be an aid to the student, who will probably wish that Mr. Cook had allowed himself more scope. Students of the Aramaic inscriptions will appreciate his method of quoting systematically every form in which a word occurs (cp. \u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u05d9, \u05d0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5); his warning that certain readings are uncertain; and his quotation of alternative readings (e.g., \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, \u05de\u05d5\u05d7\u05d4). His practice, in the case of obscure words, of quoting the context (cp. for example \u05de\u05d7\u05e8\u05ea, \u05de\u05d7\u05e8\u05ea, etc.), and in the case of bilingual inscriptions of giving the equivalent expression in the second language (\u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3, \u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3, \u05e0\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3, etc.), will be specially appreciated by the student who is not fortunate enough to have easy access to the sources. Mr. Cook's interest in comparative Semitic philology appears in useful observations occurring from time to time (cp. for\n\narticle \u05d9\u05d1\u05e0. \u05d3\u05d9\u05d1 does not mean 'tanner.' Mordtmann means to say that the Palmyrene proper name \u05d9\u05d1\u05e0, coming from a root = Arab. \u05d3\u05d9\u05d1, will mean 'tanner.' G\u00e9r\u00e2m on p. 37, given as the Ethiopic for 'fear,' should be germ\u0101. On p. 75 \u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05d8, Manaw\u00e2t, should be \u05de\u05d5\u05d0\u05d8, Manat.\n\nIn the case of Assyrian and Egyptian words, it is to be regretted that the system of transliteration employed in the CIS has been preserved. It is extremely desirable that, whatever be done about the Egyptian vowels, the system of transliteration of the consonants that is now dominant should be used in all Semitic work. This does not in Assyrian, as in Arabic, employ a \u1e25 and a \u1e25, but only a \u1e25\u2014c not being distinguishable, except etymologically. In any case it is misleading to find kinahhi on p. 37, and similarly \u1e25 in almost all Assyrian words, but pat\u0101ku on p. 24. In Egyptian, on the contrary, it need hardly be said, \u1e25 and \u1e25 represent distinct symbols and distinct sounds. Thus, in hakonu(i) on p. 53, and in Hor en heb on p. 56, \u1e25 is correct; but if so, in \u1e25rd hrt on p. 56, in anth (i.e. 'nh) on p. 94, in hontu on p. 82, in habia on p. 50 (and of course in \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9), in honau on p. 55, and in other examples, \u1e25 should be \u1e25. We may add here that we do not suppose the author means to propose a new theory of the date of Daniel when he assigns it to the middle of the second century B.C. (p. 3, note 2).\nexample such notes as those on the letters \u05e0, \u05d9, etc.). No one working through the Aramaic parts of the Old Testament should overlook the notes on the parallel or the divergent forms supplied by the inscriptions: the fact that some of the inscriptions can be dated gives special value to their evidence. Mr. Cook's work on the Encyclopaedia Biblica has given him a special interest in Semitic onomatology, which is fortunate, for he tells us that three-fifths of the entries in his glossary are proper names.\n\nFinally, we may give one example of the convenient way in which such a glossary collects interesting facts, and of the care with which it must, nevertheless, be used\u2014\n\nOne of the most firmly established facts of Semitic phonology is that, under certain conditions, words that appear in Hebrew with \u05e0 and in Arabic with \u0646 will be found in Aramaic to have \u05e0. A well-known example of this is the word \u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df, 'the earth.' It is well known, however, that certain Aramaic dialects have the remarkable parallel form \u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df (cp. Jer. x, 11). Now the glossary shows that whilst the inscriptions contain both forms, the common form \u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df occurs in only one inscription and the peculiar parallel form in no less than nine. This might lead to the generalization that the Aramaic represented by the inscriptions, most of which are late, used almost invariably the form with \u05e0. If the inscriptions containing the word are noted more carefully, however, it will be found that they are the inscriptions on the famous sculptures from Zenjirli and its neighbourhood, and the legends on certain well-known weights and tablets from Nineveh, all belonging to the eighth century or the seventh. Elsewhere in the Aramaic inscriptions the word does not happen to occur except in the one case referred to, where it appears in the common form \u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df. This is in the Sinaitic peninsula, and the inscription, which is one of the three that bear dates, belongs to about the year 189 A.D.\n\nAnyone who experiences difficulty in remembering the inscriptions by the numbers will find it pretty easy to construct an analysis of them on a single leaf of paper to keep as a mark in the glossary. He will thus be able to determine at once the nature of the attestation of any word or form.\nEnough has been said to show that the glossary is an addition to the Semitic library useful to learners and convenient for scholars, and to suggest to those who use it to help on the cause by reporting important inaccuracies to the author. Cambridge has done well in encouraging its younger scholars by undertaking the publication of such a work.\n\nHope W. Hogg.\n\nAt the last moment, as these sheets are being passed for the press, W. Luzzbarski's eagerly expected *Handbuch der Nordsemitischen Epigraphik* has been issued, and is found to contain a complete glossary. It would not be fair to compare it with the other work, their scale and scope being so different. Had the scholars in Germany and England who encouraged Mr. Cook to go on with his work been able to tell him of the enterprise on which Luzzbarski was engaged, the glossary, at least in its present form, would probably not have appeared. If its author does not regret his labour, however, no one else will. The Glossary and the explanatory columns of the *Handbuch* seem, on a rapid glance, to be to some extent complementary as well as parallel. One would not willingly be without either. Each has entries that the other lacks, and the plan of the smaller work made it possible to give many references and other notes which the learner, in particular, will find very useful.\u2014H. W.

Notes and News.\n\nJewish Ethics.\u2014Professor M. Lazarus has at length published his System of Jewish Ethics (Die Ethik des Judenthums, T. Kuhnmann, Francfort-on-the-Main, 1898), in a large and beautifully got-up volume. As might have been expected from so distinguished a thinker, this work leaves little to be desired, both as regards deepness of thought and clearness and elegance of diction. Although there are a number of smaller works on the subject, a systematic presentation of the ethical principles as developed in post-Biblical Jewish writings has been a desideratum. Of special interest are the author's arguments against E. v. Hartmann's views on the nature of ethics which are founded on a theistic basis.\n\nMagic among the Hebrews.\u2014Readers of the Journal will recollect that some months back Dr. Witton Davies read before the Society on \"Magic, Divination, and Somnology among the Hebrews and neighbouring peoples.\" This lecture has been expanded and has just appeared under the title. A notice of it will appear in our next issue.\n\nThe Vatican Congress.\u2014A Committee, consisting of the Rev. Dr. Raymond West, Professor Sayce, Dr. Thornton, Mr. Douglas, Mr. Sewell, Mr. Lyon, Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Cassel, and Dr. Cust, has been appointed to carry out all matters connected with the forthcoming Vatican Congress at Rome in October. The Council wishes every member of the Society as possibly can attend and take part in the proceedings.\n\nPagan Relics.\u2014With reference to our announcement in the Journal, p. 568, we have now to add that the King of Siam is sending an envoy to India to receive the relics sent to His Majesty by the Indian Government. The King, who gracefully accepted the offer, has agreed to keep a few Bangkok portions of the relics among the sacred relics at Burma and Ceylon.\nKA\u015aM\u012aR ANTIQUITIES.\n\nThe following interesting account, written by Dr. M. A. Stein, is abstracted from the *Times of India*, Nov. 5:\n\nA short time ago we published the news that the Ka\u015bm\u012br Durb\u0101r, upon the proposal of Captain S. H. Godfrey, Assistant Resident in Ka\u015bm\u012br, has resolved to establish a museum at \u015arinagar. The new institution, for which a suitable building is already in course of construction, is to serve for the reception of Ka\u015bm\u012br antiquities and of characteristic specimens of the arts and industries of the Valley.\n\nThere is, perhaps, no part of India which could furnish richer or more interesting materials for a local museum. There is certainly none in which the establishment of such an institution is at present more needed or more significant as a mark of progress. The whole of Ka\u015bm\u012br might have been described, until not so long ago, as one great museum of local antiquities. There were the ruins of ancient date which still cover so many prominent sites in the Valley. Time-honoured were the products of the artisan, the method of the administration, the ways and thoughts of the people.\n\nGreat are the changes which Western influences have produced in Ka\u015bm\u012br, particularly during the present Mah\u0101-r\u0101ja\u2019s reign. They reach deeper than any we can trace in the country\u2019s previous history. Much of what modern \u2018reform\u2019 has swept away will not be regretted even by the most ardent lover of old Ka\u015bm\u012br. But much of what is of high value and interest to the student of Indian history and art, is also now bound to disappear. It is time to collect these remains of antiquity, whether they are in stone and wood, in manuscripts, or in the traditions and thought of the people.\n\nThe interest which these remains claim is closely connected with the old history of Ka\u015bm\u012br. And the latter, again, is rendered curious and attractive by the exceptional advantages we enjoy for its study. Indian literature has\noften been blamed, and not without justice, for its want of historical works. Ka\u015bmir, however, has preserved for us a series of Sanskrit chronicles which in authenticity and value fairly reach the mark of the chronicles of mediaeval Europe. Adding to these the Persian records from Akbar's time onwards, Ka\u015bmir history presents itself to us in reliable accounts extending over more than 1,500 years. Traditions popular in origin, but yet of value, which are recorded in the oldest of these works, Kalha\u1e47a's Rajatarangini, carry us back even further to the times of A\u015boka and the great Indo-Scythian kings.\n\nIt is not alone this wealth of truly historical records which enables us to restore in detail the picture of ancient Ka\u015bmir. Small as the country is, its contribution to ancient Indian literature has been considerable. Sanskrit works by Ka\u015bmirian authors are plentifully preserved in the Valley. Ka\u015bmirians seem always to have had an open eye for the realities of life and for the peculiarities of their country. It is not chance that these old writers give us many a curious glimpse of contemporary Ka\u015bmir, such as the scholars of India proper rarely vouchsafe to us in regard to their own homes.\n\nNor are we entirely dependent on these indigenous sources. It is well known how much valuable information on ancient India has reached us in the accounts of foreign travellers. These do not fail us in Ka\u015bmir. The favoured \"Land of \u015a\u0101rad\u0101\" (P\u0101rvat\u012b) has always been famous for its sacred sites, its holy springs or N\u0101gas, its mountain Tirthas. A land of such spiritual merits could not be missed by the pious Christian pilgrims who wandered through the breadth and length of India during the centuries preceding the Muhammadan conquest. The curious and detailed notices which they have left us of the Valley and its inhabitants correspond to the long stay they used to make there. It seems in fact as if these pious men had not been wholly indifferent to the material attractions of the country. Ka\u015bmir has always had its charm for visitors from northern climes. Now, too, the H\u0101j\u012bs of Yarkand and the regions\nbeyond readily linger in the Valley before resuming their long journey. Hiuen Tsiang did so before them, and so other less known Buddhist pilgrims who passed through the \"Paradis terrestre des Indes\" (Bernier) to the sacred places of the dusty hot plains.\n\nIn the light which we derive from this wealth of records, the tangible remains of old Ka\u015bm\u012br resume fresh life. The coins of Ka\u015bm\u012br rulers, which we possess in almost unbroken succession from Indo-Scythian times onwards, are more than a mere framework for dynastic lists. We know often a good deal of the reigns and persons of the kings who issued them. The coins and their legends more than once illustrate in a characteristic fashion incidents of which the Chronicles tell us.\n\nThe ruined temples and sculptures, which are far more numerous about the Valley than the guidebooks would show, furnish ample materials for the study of the architecture and art of ancient Ka\u015bm\u012br. They, too, are not mute records with date and origin doubtful, as is so often the case in India proper. From the Chronicles we learn the deities to which these temples were dedicated, the names of their founders and of the sites which they were intended to adorn. We can often trace the varying fortunes which these structures underwent, and strange indeed they were sometimes.\n\nMany a famous shrine which we still see in its ruins served with the riches it once contained unscrupulous Hindu kings in their financial troubles. The massive quadrangles of others were used at times as fortified places, just as in the Middle Ages did so many monuments of ancient Rome. During the endless rebellions of the later Hindu period they stood more than one siege. Frequently we find popular Muhammadan shrines built with the slabs and columns of ancient Hindu temples, or the latter simply transformed into Zi\u0101rats. Muhammadan shrines in most cases can be shown to mark the sites of earlier Hindu worship.\n\nThis fact strikingly illustrates that slow and gradual process of conversion which led the great mass of the\nKa\u015bm\u012br population from their old gods and beliefs into the fold of Isl\u0101m. In more than one direction this conversion has remained superficial. The qualified student can still easily trace the old Hindu in the customs and superstitions of the Ka\u015bm\u012br villager.\n\nIsl\u0101m did not enter Ka\u015bm\u012br by forcible conquest. Not the valour of its inhabitants\u2014it seems to have been small indeed at all times\u2014but the great mountain barrier to the south had saved the Valley from Muhammadan invasion. The great Mahm\u016bd repeatedly endeavoured to reach Ka\u015bm\u012br: the bravest of his Hindu opponents in the Panj\u0101b had found there a refuge. But in the narrow defiles which lead to the passes over the Pir Pants\u0101l, even the resistance of a small stronghold like the ancient Lohara was enough to stem the wave that in the plains of India had proved irresistible. Ka\u015bm\u012br thus escaped that great break which the Muhammadan conquest marks in the historical development of other Indian territories. The subsequent gradual conversion to Isl\u0101m did not affect materially the marked historical individuality of the country, or the traditions and habits of its population. The ease and accuracy with which we can restore the ancient topography of Ka\u015bm\u012br serve to illustrate this fact.\n\nIf we take for comparison the great Panj\u0101b plain we find there only a few ancient sites and local names standing out as landmarks of the pre-Muhammadan epoch. It is strikingly different in Ka\u015bm\u012br. We can there trace the ancient towns, pilgrimage places, administrative divisions, etc., far back into Hindu times, with such thoroughness and accuracy as if we stood on the classic soil of Greece or Italy.\n\nIt is not surprising, perhaps, that the ancient routes through the mountains have remained unchanged. Until the advent of the British engineer man had little chance to work great changes here. But it still shows the remarkable tenacity of local tradition in Ka\u015bm\u012br that we can even to the present day follow up the old tracks over the mountains mentioned in our historical records, and locate the watch-stations which guarded the passes. Thus, e.g.,\nthe site of the stone gate which closed \"the western entrance of the kingdom\" in Hiuen Tsaiang's days, in the gorge below B\u0101r\u0101m\u016bla (Var\u0101hm\u016bla), still bears its ancient name. On the heights of the P\u012br Pants\u0101l Pass popular tradition still shows the place where cruel King Mihirakula (of the sixth century) was believed to have amused himself by throwing elephants over a precipice.\n\nIt is the same in other parts of that geographical microcosm, Ka\u015bmir. Hundreds of ancient localities mentioned by the Sanskrit chroniclers, from great towns down to modest hamlets, can be identified with certainty. \u015arinagar has retained more than the name of the ancient capital \u015arinagari, \"the City of \u015ari, i.e. the goddess of fortune.\" (This is the name which the Ka\u015bmir capital has borne since the days of A\u015boka; though the guidebooks, following a whimsical etymology of that worthy but in historical matters amusingly na\u00efve traveller, Mr. Vigne, will persist in turning it into \"the City of the Sun.\") The antiquarian can still identify in it the remains of many of the great buildings that once adorned it, the quarters into which it was divided, the canals and main thoroughfares which intersected it. Thus history guides us wherever we move in Ka\u015bmir, whether in the great flat of the river plain or high up in the alpine side-valleys. Of the ancient irrigation canals we know the makers; even for the artificial changes in the course of the Vitast\u0101 (the old Hydaspes, our 'Jhelum') we can give the date.\n\nIt is not necessary, however, for us to go back to the sculptures, coins, inscriptions, and other antiquities which the old sites yield, in order to find objects worthy of preservation in a museum. Ka\u015bmir since the time when Muhammadanism entered the Valley from the north has had its connection with Central Asia and Khor\u0101s\u0101n. Many interesting arts were imported from those quarters and developed by the Ka\u015bmiri with that imitative talent which distinguishes him. Many excellent specimens of this Muhammadan art of Ka\u015bmir, Persian in its chief features, still survive, but they are rapidly leaving the country.\nThe Ka\u015bm\u012bri, like other people, has the defects of his virtues. The same ability with which he reproduced the best elements of Persian art-design in his metal and textile work leads him to imitate only too readily European models, poor as the specimens of Western art mostly are that have hitherto reached him. Collectors know how to appreciate the worth of old Ka\u015bmir art. Most, perhaps, of what was of value, has already found its way into the public and private collections of Europe. Not much time remains to be lost if Ka\u015bmir is to retain any of the good products of its old art industries.\n\nIt is evident that nothing could help more to guide back the modern workman to the former level of his art than select models of this type. It is equally certain that a museum is the best means for their preservation in the country.\n\nIt is gratifying to find the Ka\u015bmir Durb\u0101r alive to the importance of its obligations in regard to the antiquities and the arts of the country. As far as the study of the former is concerned it has already shown its interest by enabling Dr. Srein to study the archaeology of Ka\u015bmir in detail, and to prepare an annotated English translation of the oldest of the above-named Chronicles. This is in course of publication through Messrs. A. Constable & Co., London.\n\nThe new museum which has been sanctioned, and the building of which is now rapidly advancing, will undoubtedly lead to a far more effective preservation of ancient remains than has hitherto been possible. It may also form the starting-point for a new era in the development of modern Ka\u015bmir art. For many of the European visitors from the plains who reach the Ka\u015bmir capital in yearly increasing numbers it is sure to prove an attraction. From whichever point of view the new institution is judged, it does credit alike to the enlightened policy of the Durb\u0101r and to Captain Godfrey's timely initiative. It is also satisfactory to think that the funds required for the museum have become available through the improvement in the State's finances, which has been remarkably steady during the office of the present Resident, Sir Adelbert Talbot.\nPANJ\u0100B NOTES FOR 1898.\n\nI. Colonel Davidson, after employment on the Afghan frontier, has compiled a collection of 1,600 to 1,800 sentences of the language of the Siah-Posh Kafir, an independent race, neither Hindu nor Mahometan, who dwell in the mountainous district on the eastern frontier of the kingdom of Afghanistan as lately demarked. The compiler had peculiar opportunities, and has made good use of them. He is now preparing a Vocabulary: he has not attempted a Grammar. Of this language little or nothing is known. It is important that these collections should be published.\n\nII. Mr. Macauliffe, of H.M. Indian Civil Service on the retired list, has prepared a careful translation of the Sacred Books of the Sikh or Singh Sect, dwelling in the Province of the Panj\u0101b. About forty years ago a German Professor, Dr. Trumpf, was sent out to India by the India Office to learn the language, and make a translation: he succeeded so far, that he published a volume, the Adi Granth, which was valued at the time, but something better is now required: a fuller knowledge of the language, and a larger selection of original MSS. And this Mr. Macauliffe, after a residence of a quarter of a century amidst the people, a knowledge of the modern Vernacular, and an acquaintance with learned and intelligent Sikhs, has succeeded in supplying. The difficulty now is to publish it. Specimens of the work have appeared in the pages of the Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review. Mr. Macauliffe, though he has taken his pension, still seems to cling to India as a home, and though in England at the present moment, he is returning to Amritsar to give the last finishing touch to his work, and if the funds are forthcoming from the Sikh Chieftains, to carry it through the Press.\n\nIII. M. Ujsalvy, of Paris, has published in the French language a most interesting volume on the inhabitants of both the North and South slopes of the Hindu-Kush: he has himself visited the North, or Russian, slope, and brings into notice the Ghalcha tribe. He goes into great detail\nwith regard to the people of the Southern slope, and is familiar with all the great English authorities, who have in late years written on the subject. The book is a very interesting one to read, and my long acquaintance with the Author, and general knowledge of the region, justify me in pronouncing the work to be trustworthy. Of course the languages and customs of the tribes are fully noticed.\n\nIV. I have received from the Author of a volume, entitled \"Les Ba-Ronga, les indig\u00e8nes de la Baie de Delagoa,\" a copy of his very interesting ethnographical study in the French language. I have long been acquainted with M. Junod, and he is a missionary of a Swiss Protestant Mission settled many years in that Province of South Africa, a colony of Portugal on the East Coast. A considerable portion of the work is dedicated to the language, one of the Bantu family, and the religions: the latter has not risen beyond the Animistic Class: our Author states that the two chief features are (1) worship of ancestors, (2) a conception of Heaven.\n\nR. N. Cust.\n\nOctober, 1898.\n\nA FEW REMARKS ON PICTOGRAPHS, OR ARCHAIC FORMS OF SCRIPT.\n\nA more accurate use of terms is necessary: the word 'Alphabet' in the Oxford English Dictionary applies to Written Characters representing sounds by a symbol, and the oldest existing specimen of such Alphabetic writing is the Moabite Stone, which may roughly be attributed to the eighth century before the Christian era. Yet both in English and French writings we find such use of the word 'Alphabet,' as is quite unjustifiable. It may be the case, that at the time of the Exodus there was a free use of the Egyptian Ideographs, and Assyrian Cuneiform, in the Regions between the Euphrates and the Nile; but neither of these Written Characters were Alphabetic, and the impression therefore is left, that the Alphabetic Writings attributed to Moses in the eighteenth century before the\nChristian era could not have been from his hand: he may have written in Ideographs, which at a subsequent date were transliterated into the Phoenician Alphabet.\n\nBefore the epoch of Alphabets, came the period of the extensive use of the Egyptian and Assyrian Written Characters: they are too well known to require any additional remarks.\n\nBut apparently at a date possibly anterior to these great Scripts, and at any rate more or less independent of them, are certain Pictographs, or Archaic Forms of Writing, the full description of which will be the work of the Twentieth century. Among these are:\n\nA. Cretan and Aegean in Europe.\nB. Kheta, alias Hittite, in Asia.\nC. Tifinagh in Africa.\n\nAnd there are many others, such as Cypriote in the Island of Cyprus, and Orkkan in Siberia: my object is to draw general attention to the subject: care should be taken to keep clear of all local forms of Alphabetic Writing. I limit myself to the three in my list as specimens of the three Continents.\n\nA. Cretan and Aegean.\n\nIn the Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. xiv (1894), p. 270, appeared a remarkable communication from the pen of Mr. Arthur Evans on the subject of \"Primitive Pictographs, and a Pre-Phenician Script, from Crete.\" It made a great impression on me, but I was deep in other subjects, and could only make a note of it.\n\nIn the same Journal, vol. xvii, part 1897, p. 327, has appeared from the pen of the same writer a communication on \"Further Discoveries of Cretan and Aegean Script, with Libyan and Proto-Egyptian Comparisons.\" The subject is now lifted into the first rank of questions to be solved in the Twentieth century.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nThe second Essay is divided into three Parts:\n\nPart I. \"The Discoveries,\" subdivided into nine Sections, with 27 Plates.\n\nPart II. \"Proto-Egyptian and Libyan Comparisons,\" subdivided into four Sections.\n\nPart III. \"Concluding Observations.\"\n\nPart I (second Essay). The Author states, that from the evidence of Cretan seals it was demonstrable that there existed a form of pictographic writing from its simplest beginnings to a more conventional and abbreviated stage. A variety of data supplied by seals, vases, and inscribed stones showed the further existence of a linear system of writing, connected with the other, and presenting striking comparisons with Egyptian Inscriptions on the South, and the syllabic script of Cyprus and Anatolia. In some instances Cretan linear characters displayed a remarkable correspondence with Phenician and Early Greek letter-forms.\n\nThe evidence showed, that the purely pictorial class of Cretan seal went back to the Twelfth Dynasty in Egypt, or more than 2500 B.C.; and further evidence has since gone to prove an earlier contact of Crete with Egypt than that date.\n\nThey were, however, beyond doubt indigenous, the later conventionalized pictographs approaching nearer to the Hittite character than the Egyptian.\n\nThe Author then passes under review the different classes:\n\n1. Primitive Prism seal with linear characters and figures.\n2. Early Pictographic Prism seals.\n3. Later seals with conventionalized Pictographs.\n4. Signet-shaped stones with conventionalized Pictographs, and other figures.\n5. Seals and other objects with linear signs.\n6. Inscribed vase from Cerigo.\n7. Inscribed Libation Table from the Diktaean Cave.\n\nPart II, Sections 1 and 3. The points of resemblance to the Cretan and Egyptian scripts are here dwelt upon, and there can be no doubt that the populations of Crete\nand Egypt were thrown into constant intercourse, and\na resemblance of the outcome of their culture and form of\nreligious worship can cause no surprise.\n\nSection 2 opens out the still more interesting considera-\ntion, that Crete was the meeting-point of Thraco-Phrygian\nelements to the North, and Libyan elements to the South.\n\nThe Author considers that the intervention of Libyan\nintermediaries seems necessary to explain the primitive\nrelations between Crete and the Valley of the Nile. At\nthe same time, the remains found in Crete bring it in\nrelation with the Western coastlands of Asia Minor, the\nmainland of Greece, and even the Danubian Basin. While\nthe influence from the South of Egypt must be admitted, the\npresence of members of the great Thraco-Phrygian race\nmust also be admitted.\n\nSection 4 deals with the resemblance with the Tifinagh\nAlphabet, which is described separately in this essay.\n\nPart III. The Author admits, that the proved antiquity\nof the Egyptian Script gives some warrant for inferring,\nthat the Egyptians are not indebted to the populations of\nthe Mediterranean Basin for the ideas of interchange of\nthought by means of the eye as well as the ear. On the\nother hand, he concedes, that the ancient relations betwixt\nCrete and the African littoral of the Mediterranean suggest,\nthat the early Script of the island, if not derived from\nEgypt, was at least influenced in its development from that\nquarter. This is as far as we can safely go with our present\nlimited knowledge of the environment.\n\nIt is, moreover, evident, that through a wide European\narea there exist the records of a primitive picture-Script,\nwhich, as far back as prehistoric time, showed a tendency\nto simplify itself into abbreviated linear signs.\n\nThe Author concludes with the following remarks, which\nspeak highly for his good sense and freedom from sensa-\ntional haphazard guesses:\n\n\"I have abstained from any attempt to interpret either\nthe linear, or the pictographic, Script. The main object has\nbeen to collect materials and institute comparisons.\"\nB. Kheta or Hittite.\n\nIn Luzac's Oriental List, 1898, I read as follows:\u2014\n\n\"A book has just been published by Colonel Conder entitled 'The Hittites and their Language,' in which the author makes an attempt to explain the Hittite symbols, and gives what he calls 'translations' of the 'Hittite' Inscriptions. Colonel Conder bases his system of decipherment on the assumption that the Hittite, Cyprian, and Akkadian forms of writing are interchangeable, and that a superficial resemblance in the form of any two signs is sufficient to prove their identity of value. His 'translations' of the texts are based on the further assumption, that 'Hittite' is Turkish in character. It is needless to point out to our readers, that both these assumptions are entirely without proof or foundation. We could wish that the labour, which it is evident Colonel Conder has expended on his work, had been applied in a direction, where it might have been rewarded with more valuable results.\"\n\nIn The Athen\u00e6um of August 27, 1898, p. 285, is a very hostile review of Colonel Conder's newly-published book, \"The Hittites and their Language\" (Blackwood & Son). Allusion is made to Professor Jensen's articles in the Zeitschrift of the German Oriental Society about three years ago, and the decipherment of this language. Professor Jensen has now published a solid work, \"Hittites and Armenians.\" Colonel Conder gives a Hittite Vocabulary, and fifteen plates of Hittite Inscriptions taken from the Marash Lion, various slabs, figures, and seals. No bilingual Inscription has been found. No two authorities agree: Jensen connects the Armenian with it, Conder the Accadian: there is no certainty, that they have any claim to the name of Hittite, for no character has been identified to the satisfaction of all.\n\nC. Tifinag.\n\nI quote from my own \"Languages of Africa,\" p. 75, 1883:\u2014\n\n\"Of the old Libyan or Numidian form of writing\nspecimens are found in Inscriptions brought casually to light, and not yet satisfactorily explained. It is the mother of the existing local written Character, called the Tifin\u00e1g, the language being called Tamash\u00e9k, and the tribe using it is the Tiw\u00e1r\u00edk of the Sah\u00e1ra, a subdivision of the Berber Family.\n\nOudney first noticed them in 1822; Richardson drew attention to them in 1847, and an account by him was published by the Foreign Office. In the highways of the Desert are found blocks of stone entirely covered with this Character. The Arabs were totally ignorant of their meaning. In the houses are similar scribblings on the walls. Attempts have been made, with some success, to translate them. They are read from right to left, and form a syllabary. Hanoteau in his Grammar of the Kabail and Tamash\u00e9k Languages, Hal\u00e9vy and De Sauloy in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Paris, Letourneux in the Report of the Florence Oriental Congress, Faulman in his work on Written Characters, have noticed this Character. See also De la Blanch\u00e8re, \"Inscriptions Sahariennes et l'\u00e9criture Libyque\" (Bulletin Correspondance Africaine, vi, p. 354, 1883); Duveyrier, \"Explorations de Sahara Inscriptions,\" p. 396; \"Alphabet Libyque\" (Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, p. 253, 1884).\n\nI communicated to a Vice-President of this Society, who is a master in this particular department of science, my intention of writing a brief Memorandum on this subject. In his reply he remarked: \"A hypothesis, or rather a suspicion, has been growing up in my mind of late, that the chief Hieroglyphic systems of the ancient world really had a common origin somewhere in Western Asia: that all the pictorial systems were developed out of this primitive and embryonic Script. Along with this suspicion has been another, that the Neolithic people of primeval Egypt and Northern Africa had a linear system of writing, which has left its traces in the Tifin\u00e1g and linear Cretan, and signs on Neolithic Egyptian pottery. These signs continued to be used by the non-Phenician\n\"population of Egypt down to a comparatively late date,\n\"and are found not only in pottery but on the rocks.\"\n\n\"However, these are only suspicions, and I must leave\n\"it to younger men to find out whether they are justified\n\"or not. I am getting too old for pioneering work.\"\n\nThis explains my motive in putting forth this brief paper.\nI lay the idea, the suspicion, the germ of a conception,\nbefore some retired Anglo-Indian official, about fifty\nyears old, who wants a subject, which has been apparently\nnot occupied by another. He can feel carefully, without\npartiality or prejudice, down the outline of the conception,\nread up all that has been written, and write a paper for\nthe Journal of this Society in the early years of the\nTwentieth Century. I shall not be there to read it.\n\nR. N. C.\n\nOctober 25, 1898.\n\nNote on James Fraser, Author of the \"History of\nNadir Shah\" (1742).\n\nJames Fraser is the author of the first book in English\non N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, \"that very costive Sophy,\" as Byron calls\nhim, known in the East as \u062a\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, or the Scourge of God.\nFraser's work is a first-hand contribution to the history of\nthe period, important not only by reason of its early date,\nbut because of the number of original documents it has\npreserved, documents not to be found elsewhere.\u00b9 In\naddition to his claim as an author, he is entitled to some\nbrief record as an early, if not the very first, collector of\nmanuscripts in India; and thus indirectly a prominent\ncontributor to the valuable Oriental collections of the\nBodleian Library at Oxford. On the strength of the above\nachievements he was, I should have thought, entitled to\n\n\u00b9 Lowndes (ed. 1858, p. 834) gives the \"History of Nadir Shah\" as published\nin 1732. This is an impossible date, N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h's invasion of India, with\nwhich the book is chiefly concerned, not having occurred until 1737-8. The\ndate must surely be a mistake for 1742. All the copies I have seen are of the\nsecond edition and dated 1742. Apparently the first edition appeared in January\nof the same year (Gent. Mag. for 1742, p. 56).\na modest place in the \"Dictionary of National Biography\"; and though passed over there, it is stranger still that his name is not to be found in the \"Book of Eminent Scotsmen\" of Joseph Irving (1881); but this neglect may yet be rectified by Dr. Eth\u00e9 in the second volume of his Bodleian Catalogue of Persian MSS., as announced (now, alas! nearly nine years ago) in the preface to his first volume.\n\nAs a small contribution to Fraser's biography, I have transcribed some manuscript notes from a copy of the \"Nadir Shah\" lately acquired by me. The book belonged in 1754 to Samuel Smalbroke, son of Dr. R. Smalbroke, the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry mentioned by Fraser in his preface, p. vi (at the top). The notes referred to are without doubt by S. Smalbroke himself.\n\n[On the flyleaf.] \"January 21st, 1754, Novo Stylo\u2014Died Mr. James Fraser at his own house at Rylick near Inverness in Scotland: he went out Writer to ye Factory at Suratt, then after Returning to England and publishing this Book, carried his new-married Wife . . . . with him to ye Indies, whither he went as Supercargo.

It lies in the parish of Kirkhill, a few miles southwest of the town of Inverness, and had in 1845, after great\ndrainage improvements, a rental of \u00a3640 a year (\"New Statistical Account of Scotland,\" vol. xiv, p. 460). The family, according to John Anderson (\"Historical Account of the family of Frisel or Fraser,\" 1825, pp. 71\u20136, 195), was founded early in the sixteenth century by Hutcheon Bain, an illegitimate son of Thomas, fourth Lord Lovat (d. 21st October, 1524). On referring to Burke's \"Landed Gentry,\" ed. 1894, vol. i, p. 709, I find that James Fraser (1713\u20131755) was descended in the seventh generation from this progenitor; he was the second but eldest surviving son of Alexander Fraser (d. 1733). James married in London, Mary, only daughter of Edward Satchell, of Warwickshire; she died 18th June, 1795. Their only son, Edward Satchell Fraser (1751\u20131835), was the father of John Baillie Fraser (1783\u20131856), the author of several books of travel in India and Persia (see \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" and \"Encyclopaedia Britannica,\" 9th edition). Another son was William Fraser, Commissioner of Delhi, who was shot there in 1835 (W. H. Sleeman, \"Rambles and Recollections,\" 1844, vol. ii, pp. 215\u2013231; R. Bosworth Smith, \"Life of Lord Lawrence,\" 1883, vol. i, pp. 75\u201378). Other grandsons of James Fraser were connected with the East, viz., Edward S., who died at St. Helena, 25th April, 1813; Alexander Charles, who died in India, 4th June, 1816, aged 27; and George John, 1st Bengal Cavalry, who died at Aurangabad, 27th August, 1842, aged 42. Burke's date, 1755, for James Fraser's death, must, if we follow S. Smalbroke's notes, be altered to 1754.\n\nThe Court Books of the East India Company from 1728 to 1750, which I have been permitted to consult at the India Office, furnish no confirmation of Mr. Smalbroke's statement that James Fraser went out the first time to India as a Writer. Very probably that was the case, though I have not traced the appointment. But I find that, on his second visit to that country, he went as the Company's servant, having been appointed on the 12th November, 1742, a Factor on the Bombay establishment to reside at Surat. His bondsmen in \u00a31,000 each were Hugh Ross and George\nFryer, of London, merchants. On the same date he was posted as an agent to Mocha in the Red Sea, with 2\u00bd per cent. commission, other 2\u00bd per cent. being apportioned between his two colleagues, Captain Freeman and Mr. Parker. On the 29th December, 1742, Fraser's wife and a little girl, a relative of his, were allowed to proceed to Bombay on one of the Company's ships. On the 14th September, 1748, a letter was received from James Fraser at Surat, dated the 10th, 22nd, and 24th November, 1747; and he must have left India soon afterwards, for on the 12th January, 1749, he presented a Memorial for an inquiry into some official dispute or quarrel. He is there described as \"late of Council at Surat.\" I have not pursued my inquiries further, the above being sufficient to confirm the assertion that he was in the Honourable Company's service.\n\nAnquetil Duperron (\"Zendavesta,\" vol. I, Discours pr\u00e9liminaire, cccclviii, cccclix) heard of Fraser at Surat from the Parsi, Dastur Shapur, and it was to inspect Fraser's Zand MSS. in the Bodleian that in 1762 he (A. D.) visited Oxford, when brought a prisoner of war to England. James Darmsteter (\"Annales du Mus\u00e9e Guimet, Zendavesta,\" I, Introduction, xi) does not seem to have known much about Fraser, nor is what he does say very accurate. \"Quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard\" [i.e. after 1720, when Bourchier sent home to Oxford a Zand manuscript] \"l'\u00c9cossais Frazer, conseiller \u00e0 Bombay, se rendit \u00e0 Surat pour \u00e9tudier aupr\u00e8s des Parsis; ils lui vendaient deux manuscrits et lui refus\u00e8rent leurs le\u00e7ons.\" Here we may note (1) that Fraser was of the Surat, not of the Bombay Council; (2) that he had already lived at Surat ten years, 1730-1740; (3) that he procured many more than two Zand manuscripts; (4) that, as p. vi of his Preface to \"Nadir Shah\" shows, he had no difficulty in obtaining Parsi teachers; (5) that, as Mr. Smalbroek's annotations prove, Fraser had a working knowledge of the Zand tongue. Fraser's death at the\ncomparatively early age of forty-one years goes a long way to account for his doing nothing further with the material that he had so assiduously accumulated.\n\nWm.

VIII.\u2014Extracts from the Tamil \"Purra-poru\u1e37 Venb\u0101-M\u0101lai,\" and the \"Purra-nann\u016bru.\" By the Rev. G. U. Pope, M.A., D.D.\n\nThe Purra-poru\u1e37 Venb\u0101-M\u0101lai is a very ancient work, professing to be founded upon a still older composition called \"The Twelve Chapters,\" by one of the twelve disciples of Agastiyar.\u00b9 This points to a mythic origin, but we cannot historically go further than its Tamil author, or compiler, as he would represent himself. It is quite essential for a Tamil writer who would become a classic to cite his original, or the authoritative 'first-work' from which he draws (or professes to draw) his materials. (See Nann\u016b\u1e37, 4\u201310, and Pope's 3rd Grammar, p. 142.) Where there is no such 'first-work' (Muthan\u016b\u1e37), he or his commentators must suppose or invent one, and ascribe it to some venerable personage. The real author here is Aiy\u0101n\u0101r-Ith\u0101n, of whom nothing is known but that he is said to have been a descendant of the old \u010c\u0113ra kings, and the compiler of this very interesting composition. It can hardly be less than ten centuries old. It has recently been for the first time printed under the editorship of\n\n\u00b9 In the commentary on the Tel-K\u014dppya\u1e41 by Nacchin\u0101rkkiniy\u0101r, Porul-athi, ix, 94 (Cf. Vai T\u0101motharam Pillai's edition, p. 807, Madras, 1855), reference is made to this statement.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nV\u0113. \u00c7\u0101min\u0101thaiyar of Uttamat\u0101na-puram, the very learned and worthy Tamil Head-Pandit of the Kumbak\u014d\u1e47am College; and has probably never been seen by any European till now, though the late Sir Walter Elliot (clarum et venerabile nomen) obtained and caused to be translated some fragments of it. These were edited for private circulation by R. Sewell, Esq., M.C.S. Some were also printed in the Asiatic Quarterly.\n\nM\u0101lai means 'garland.' Ve\u1e45b\u0101 (see Pope's Kurral, Int. xxv, and Nal\u0101\u1e0di, Int. xxvi) is the name of the metre\u2014very artistic quatrains like those in the N\u0101ladiy\u0101r.\n\nPorul is a subdivision both of grammar and of treatises in general, and signifies 'substance, reality, subject.' This Porul is divided in the most ancient grammar, the Tol-K\u0101ppya\u1e41, into Agam ('inner') and Purram ('outer'). Of these, Agam ('the subjective') treats of love, its various emotions, incidents, and accidents. Purram ('the objective') relates to all 'other things'\u2014life in general, and especially war, and the affairs of kingdoms. This work, though professing to treat of practical subjects in general (Purram), has portions, as will be seen, which belong to the other division (Agam)\u2014emotional and passionate. The ideas and even the phraseology of these verses are cited and used by all commentators upon the other classics, as being of absolute authority.\n\nIt is divided into twelve chapters (Padalam : Skr. \u092a\u0926\u0932\u092e\u094d), or as they are generally termed, Tinai (\u091f\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0908), containing 360 quatrains.\n\nIt seems probable that the work itself is more ancient than the Kurral, and suggested many of its couplets. It is closely allied in subject and in tone to the Purra-n\u0101nn\u016bru\n\n1 Tinai. This much used Tamil word-of-all-work really signifies 'genus,' and is applied to the main divisions of any subject. These are divided into sections (turrai = \u091f\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0930\u0908). This latter is equal to 'species,' and is used for the subdivisions of a subject. Here, each chapter is preceded by a small summary; and every quatrain has a curious little couplet giving the pith of the quatrain. This couplet is called Kolu (= 'substance, contents': from \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6).\n\"PURRA-PORUL VENBA-M\u0100LAI.\"\n\n(P.N.N.), with which and the Tol-K\u0101ppya\u1e41 it must be studied, though it is more recent than the text of these works.\n\nIt will be necessary to give some account of the Purra-n\u0101nn\u016bru, or \"Four Hundred Lyrics of Life.\" This anthology has been lately printed for the first time, though it has been in existence for upwards of a thousand years, and contains ballads which in substance must have been sung in the early centuries of our era. We owe it also to \u010c\u0101min\u0101thaiyar, the learned and indefatigable Professor of Tamil in the Kumbak\u014d\u1e47am Government College, that it is now carefully edited and put forth with all necessary apparatus in such a way that it may find an entrance into the house of every Tamil scholar. This is the fifth large work issued by the same editor. The industry and learning which have been employed in the editing of these books would have gained for \u010c\u0101min\u0101thaiyar a very high place among scholars in Europe, if the subject had been one which the scholars of the West were disposed to value. But, although the very ancient, copious, and refined Tamil language is inferior to none, it is regarded by most people as the (probably barbarous) vernacular of a people living somewhere in a remote district of Great Britain's imperial possessions. Neither does our Indian Government nor do our Universities fully recognize the value of Tamil literature; and those who spend their lives in the study of the great South Indian classics must resemble men seeking for pearls under water. Our editor's compatriots, however, will not be slow to recognize the benefit that his studies are conferring upon his people. Nor is it too much to hope that his labours may be so far recognized as to procure for him such pecuniary assistance as may save him from absolute loss. Tamil scholarship is a direct road to poverty!\n\nTo return from this digression. This work consists of 400 Lyrics, varying in length from six lines to fifty, being for the most part songs sung by Court minstrels and wandering bards in honour of the kings of the South, including not only the P\u0101ndiyan, the \u010c\u014dran, and the \u010c\u0113ran kings, but about 120 of the petty R\u0101jas and\nchieftains who then divided the South, and were more or less independent, having their fortresses on every hill and coign of vantage throughout the southern land. Of those ancient rulers and heroes scarcely anything is known but what these, and a few similar works, enable us to conjecture. Their names have not yet been found or recognized in inscriptions or on coins, and it is very doubtful whether we shall ever be able to recover many authentic details of their history. Still, the glimpses of ancient manners, thought, and conditions of life afforded by these poems are exceedingly interesting. The ancient bards, about 150 in number, fragments of whose songs have thus been rescued, were of very unequal powers; but some of them display, if I am not mistaken, very great poetical genius, and some of the fragments are veritable gems.\n\nIt is worthy of note, also, that of these poems, except the introductory invocation (which is of much later date, by Perum Devan\u0101r,' the translator of the Mah\u0101-B\u0101ratham), none make any decided allusion to \u010civa worship. Demons are constantly referred to, and various charms and ceremonies for driving them away from the battlefield, where it was their delight to hold their every festivals, are mentioned. Throughout all the petty kingdoms of the Tamil lands there seems then to have been a system of demon-worship much like what now prevails in the extreme south.\n\nFeasts and dances in honour of Murugan (from T. 'murugu,' a fragrant wood: Agallochum) are often alluded to. He was evidently the tutelary god of the aborigines of the South, and is now promoted to be the younger son of \u010civan.\n\nI shall reserve a more minute account of these poems, their heroes and their bards, for another occasion, and return at once to the Purra-porul Ve\u1e47b\u0101-M\u0101lai.\n\n1 He seems to have edited a series of works for the Madura literati.\nPADALAM I.\n\nVedchi, or the Cattle-raiders.\n\nThe first tinai is called Vedchi, and the following seven divisions have titles of a similar import. They are taken from the garlands worn by warriors in the contests in which the tribes of South India in those times seem to have been incessantly engaged. The Tamil rhetoricians enumerate eight species of distinctive garlands worn by kings and warriors when going forth on various expeditions, the garland being supposed to indicate the character of the undertakings, and the feelings of those engaged in them.\u00b9\n\nThis is to us a novel form of the 'language of flowers.'\n\nThe Vedchi (Qai'g) is the Ixora coccinia, which is commonly called 'Flame of the Forest,' or sometimes 'the country geranium.' It bears a profusion of flowers, sometimes of quite dazzling brightness, and of a deep scarlet hue. These garlands were intended to strike terror into the eyes of the opposing hosts, and to some extent supplied the place of military uniform. The armies of Europe have never been unmindful of the moral effect of the soldier's headdress; though it would be a novel experience if our troops went forth to war like a marching garden of flaming and fragrant flowers! The warriors who wore the vedchi were cattle-raiders. It would seem that this constituted no small part of the duty\u2014and duty was delight\u2014of the ancient South Indian soldier.\n\nThis Padalam, or chapter, contains twenty verses, and illustrates with exceeding clearness several phases of the thoughts and habits of the people in those 'good old times'! A translation is given of the more important verses, and a summary of the remainder.\n\n\u00a7 1. The King's Call to the Cattle-raid.\n\nVerse 1. The King Summoning his People.\n\n\"Youthful warrior, who bearest the wondrous three-pronged dart, go forth, seize and bring home the herds of cattle with\n\n\u00b9 They were not infrequently artificial, composed of gold and gems.\nthe bulls their leaders! See your foes bending their bows, as though they would cut down whole forests and set them on fire, and inspecting their arrows as they fit them to the string. Put their ranks to flight!\"\n\n\u00a7 2. The Toddy-booth.\n\nThis introduces the idea, which is always coming to the front in these poems, of the 'toddy-jar.' [\u00a715.] The raid begins and ends with the canteen!\n\nVerse 2.\n\n\"Forget not, O thou with the loving large eyes, the clear sweet boiled palm-juice in the standing jar of toddy, never empty. The warrior on whose feet are the heroes' anklets, who is fierce of eye, endures not debt. To-morrow's morn shall see the foeman's herds thronging thy wide-extended gates.\"\n\nIt would seem that these champions cleared off their scores with the nymph of the palm-wine jar by means of the plunder they brought home. [\u00a716.]\n\nAll classes except Br\u0101hmans, even the ladies, are represented as indulging freely in the use of toddy. The same thing is illustrated in the Kambar-R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47am, where the whole Court\u2014king, queens, princes, counsellors, and warriors\u2014are represented as indulging in a most unedifying debauch of many days' duration. [B\u0101la-Kh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dam, xviii: 'The Canto of the Festivities.]\n\n\u00a7 3. Eager for the fray.\n\nVerse 3.\n\n\"The raven's hoarse cry arises in the jungles of our foes who own the beauteous herd\u2014omen of ill to them; while beating their drums our warriors armed with long spears put on the vedch\u012b flower and go forth upon the well-nigh impervious paths, where the raven croaks.\"\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Cf. P.N.N., 280.\n\u00a7 4. Omens.\n\nThis speaks of omens which are continually referred to here.\n\nVerse 4.\n\n\"In the little town encircled with barriers, at eventide, while our people stand around with clasped hands, she [the wise woman of the village] speaks, and would say, 'Bring forth toddy from the jar in the stand'; but really says, 'Bring the large-eyed cow from the shed.' Therefore, O thou who bear'st the bent bow in thy mighty hand, the victory is ours.\"\n\n\u00a7 5. They go forth.\n\nThe raiders armed with bows, and so styled in Tamil, 'Ploughmen of the Bow' (cf. Kurrat, 872), go forth through the stony wilderness to the hill fortress of those whose cattle they are bent on carrying off.\n\nVerse 5.\n\n\"Like death's satellites, bearing the curved bow in their left hands,\nfollowed by flocks of vultures they go forward!\nTheir minds fixed on the station where the herds of cattle are found,\nthey make for the hill whereon the long bambus wave.\"\n\n\u00a7 6. The Scouts.\n\nThe raiders send forward trusty spies to ascertain the precise position of the bell-bearing herds, and the number of the warriors to whom these belong.\n\n1 Here \u039f\u03c3\u03c0 = 'stand,' or 'cowshed'; \u039f\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03be = 'toddy from the jar,' or 'large-eyed'; and for \u03b2 they heard \u03b1 = 'cow': so she seemed to say, 'Bring the large-eyed cow from the fold.' The sybil seemed involuntarily, by the mistake of a letter (\u03b1 for i), to urge them to the raid.\nThe world of fashion is ever-changing, with new trends emerging every season. From bold prints to minimalist designs, there's something for everyone. Whether you're looking for a statement piece or something more understated, the fashion industry has got you covered.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of fashion is the way it reflects culture and history. From vintage-inspired looks to modern interpretations of classic styles, fashion is a powerful tool for self-expression.\n\nAs we move into the future, sustainability becomes an increasingly important consideration. Many designers are now focusing on eco-friendly materials and ethical production practices, ensuring that their creations are not only stylish but also environmentally conscious.\n\nIn conclusion, fashion is more than just clothes\u2014it's a reflection of our individuality and a celebration of creativity. So whether you're dressing for success or simply enjoying the ride, embrace the journey and let your style shine!\n\u00a7 9. The Seizure of the Cattle.\n\nHaving overcome and taken the stronghold, the victorious heroes seize the whole herd\u2014bulls and cows and calves.\n\nVerse 9.\n\n\"Like a congregation of spotted tigers, in the town in midmost of the bambu-encircled upland plain they take possession of the assembled herds, and round about stand steadfast to repel all who would set them free.\"\n\n\u00a7 10. The Fight around the Herds.\n\nNow muster on all sides the clansmen of the attacked people wearing wreaths of Karanthai (\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03ac\u03b9, a species of Basil, bearing a dark purple flower). This wreath is worn by the bands that come forth to rescue the stolen cattle and repel the raiders. The whole subject is more fully treated in the second Padalam.\n\nVerse 10.\n\n\"Those, who came to retake the herds from the raiding host, have fallen; the vultures have swooped down upon the corpses of the slain; their dark clouds are like those of the arrows reeking with blood, that the foemen, fearful as those of the cruel Bowman death, have sent forth.\"\n\n\u00a7 11. The Cattle driven off over the Wolds.\n\nThe raiders, to elude pursuit, drive off the herd quietly through wild unfrequented paths.\n\nVerse 11.\n\n\"'Let the cattle graze, and rest awhile in quiet companionship': thus spake the bow-bearing, jewel-ankleted hero, though he saw the rescuing host rushing after, like water from a lofty hill; and so they paused under the shadow of the mighty crags.\"\n\u00a7 14. Division of the Spoils.\n\nThe raided herds of cattle are distributed among the successful soldiers according to each one's deserts.\n\nVerse 14.\n\n\"To those who overcame with their glittering swords,\u2014\nto those who sought out as spies, and brought back the tale,\u2014\nto the skilful ones that interpreted the favouring omens,\u2014\nthey divide the herds of cattle in the little town.\"\n\n\u00a7 15. The Feast.\n\nThe warriors with jewelled anklets, that tinkle as they walk, drink 'toddy,' and dance rejoicing.\n\nVerse 15.\n\n\"The aspect of the maidens, sweet of speech and fair as Lakshmi,\nfills with pleasing pains the warrior's soul!\nThe gladness of the intoxicating draught departs, as does\nthe anger against his foes from out his soul.\"\nLove is lord of all!\n\n\u00a7 16. Gifts.\n\nThe spoils acquired in the raid are lavishly bestowed on all that ask.\n\nVerse 16.\n\n\"The wealth brought back from the battlefield by the warriors\nthat flinched not in the strife, but bent their bows,\nhas become the price paid for the fiery drink\nby musicians, drummers, singers, and singing women.\"\n\n\u00a7 17. Extra Rewards.\n\nTo those who as scouts explored beforehand the scene of the fierce strife they give more honour than they take unto themselves.\nVerse 17.\n\n\"To those who feared not death, but night and day\nexplored the battlefield, spied out, and brought us news,\nsome gifts beyond those given to others surely is due,\na warrior wielding the keen dart, that slays the fiery foe!\"\n\n\u00a7 15. The Favourable Prognosticators.\n\nSome reward is given to those who faithfully expounded\nthe lucky signs.\n\nVerse 18.\n\n\"When we went forth with minds intent upon our foemen's\nhearts,\nthese make plain the favouring signs, and sounds that gave\nus heart:\nthink not of what is strictly due as their share; to each give\nher arms with udders large, distended with milk!\"\n\n\u00a7 19. The Drummer.\n\nThe verses of the old man who beats the drum, according\nto ancient custom, for the jewel-ankleted warriors, are\naddressed:\n\nVerse 19.\n\n\"For my grandsire's grandsire his grandsire's grandsire\nbeat the drum! For my father his father did the same;\nin his feet From duties of his clan he has not swerved:\nyour oath for him one other cup of palm-tree's purest\nsweetest wine!\"\n\nThe following song (P.N.X., 290) illustrating this section\nis ascribed to the ancient poetess Avvaiyar:\n\n\"O A., whose chariot drawn by angry elephants\nin the tray, pour out for him the palm-wine.\nin fierce fight, when spears flew thick,\nas the workman's pincers,\nthy father's father!\"\nHe, too, with valour filled, instinct with glory of his race,\nshall, like palm-leaves that screen from sun's fierce rays,\nhide thy head from the spear hurled at it.\"\u00b9\n\n\u00a7 20. The Demoness Kottavai.\n\nHere they celebrate the never-failing grace of her who\nprotects the warlike host, whose glory never grows dim.\n\nVerse 20.\n\n\"Her beauteous banner bears the lion's form. Her hand\nthe golden parrot grasps and bounding stag.\nA countless host of demons round her press\u2014great Kottavai!\nWhen we designed the attack on the foeman's fort,\nshe went before our host, and made foes flee!\"\n\n\u00a7 21. The Devil-Dance.\n\nThe damsels, with flawless jewels decked, dance the mystic\ndance with V\u0113lan,\u00b2 now the deed is done. This is called the\nValjai Dance.\n\nVerse 21.\n\n\"Did the black-throated One\u00b3 behold, he would rejoice;\nit is the dance performed for the dart-hurling Murugan\nby warrior and by jewel-bearing lovely maid,\nwith fragrant garlands dight.\"\n\nThe following (P.N.N., 257) gives a portrait of the leader\nof the cattle-raid. It is somewhat confused, but belongs to\nthe VE\u0110CHI Pa\u1e0dalam:\n\nCall the Milkmaids!\n\n\"Softly he treads as though pebbles were in his sandals;\nhuge his paunch and broad his chest,\nbright his eye, and beard bristly as the mountain-side,\nhis cheeks hang down like dewlaps!\n\n\u00b9 \"He will cover thy head in the day of battle.\"\n\u00b2 V\u0113lan = spearman.\n\u00b3 \u0106ivan.\nWho is this that thus cometh with his bow? A fearful sight!\nLook close, he doth not come from far;\nhe is not one whose fort is in the wilderness.\nAt early dawn he watched the course of the foeman's herds,\npointed them out with his hand, numbered them,\nand with his bow drove off the would-be rescuers!\nThe herd is large, but what the gain\nif those who milk with white large-mouthed vessels,\nand who churn, are not at hand.\"\n\nThese twenty-one verses form the whole Padalam commemorating the incidents of the cattle-raid.\n\n---\n\nPADALAM II.\n\nThe Karanthai Wreath, or the Rescuers.\n\nThis is a wreath of basil or tula\u00e7i, a sacred plant of several species having dark purple flowers, contrasting with the bright crimson of the Ve\u1e0dchi of the former Padalam. This Karanthai wreath was worn by those who went forth to oppose the raiders and rescue the herds. In P.N.N. there are eleven lyrics referred to this Tinai.\n\n\u00a7 1. The Karanthai.\n\nHere the owners of the herds with their chaplets of dark purple flowers rush forth to the rescue.\n\nVerse 22.\n\n\"The crowding warriors crown their heads with garlands of karanthai,\nand go forth to rescue the herds the foeman drives away;\nas though one should bring back the souls of dwellers on earth begirt by the sounding sea, after death has devoured them.\"\n\u00a7 2. The Summons.\n\nThe people whose herds are being driven away are bidden to relinquish their occupations and haste to the rescue.\n\nVerse 23.\n\n\"The jewel-ankleted heroes, the fierce bowmen,\nthey who wield the spear, men terrible to sight, who fear not death in their fierce anger,\u2014all hear the sound of the drum,\nand go to rescue the flocks which the Vedchi-chapleted have carried off.\"\n\n\u00a7 3. The Rescuers on the Track.\n\nOnly those unfit for war remain in the town; the rest, boiling with fierce wrath, follow the track of the raiders.\n\nVerse 24.\n\n\"The conch-shell sounds, with the mighty horn, and instruments of music;\nadorned with peacock feathers, and roused by the roll of the loud drum,\nthe Rescuers arise, and over the fiery desert make their way,\nfollowing the tracks of the cattle,\u2014spears glistening like the sun.\"\n\n\u00a7 25. The Doubtful Fight.\n\nThey draw near the raiders, surround them, attack them with fearful energy, and a battle with many changeful fortunes is fought.\n\nVerse 25.\n\n\"Like a multitude of tigers or lions or warrior-elephants,\nfull of power and wrath and honourable shame and glorious resolve\nthey shout, and hasten on, as they hear\nthe raiders' defiant cry;\u2014and so the battle rages.\"\nThe following sections of this chapter speak of the glory of the individual heroes on either side. They fall fighting to the last full of enthusiasm. But we shall henceforth content ourselves with a few specimen verses.\n\n\u00a7 13. The Glory of the King.\n\nThe praise is sung of the Marravan king, a valiant swordsman.\n\nVerse 34.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"They truly live who yield their lives fighting against the foe in the fierce battle amid the flash of swords and the whirling of the spear!\"\n\n\u00a7 14. The Heroic Race.\n\nThe praises of the heroes of tried valour and of ancient race.\n\nVerse 35.\n\n\"The men of ancient race that appear foremost in the fight wielding their swords; who stand as, in the universal deluge, some mountain-top rises firm amid the flood;\u2014what wonder if their glory lives when all falsehoods have passed away!\"\n\nThus ends the chapter of the Rescue.\n\nWe have seen that many of the lyrics in the Purranannurru seem to have been composed from the hints given in these verses; or it may be that from those lyrics this more systematized work has arisen. Certain it is that they are closely connected, and must be studied together. Thus P.N.N., 259, evidently refers to an incident in the attempted rescue. The rescuers are in sight of the raided flocks, but the raiders themselves are not seen; the bard cries out to the angry pursuers:\n\n\"See'st not the ambushed Marravars with well-strung bows, hid in the jungle vast amid the leafy trees, who while the raided cattle move, move not with them!\"\n\"PURRA-POUL VENBA-MALAI.\"\n\nStay, stay, all honour to thy glorious soul! O thou whose foot the hero's jewelled anklet wears, by whose side glistens the sword resplendent, whose steeds, quivering with eagerness, shake like the priestess' frame before the demon shrine, when Murugan inspires her soul!\"\n\nHere we have an instructive glimpse of the current demon worship, with the agitated priestess dancing wildly before the image of the hill-god. This may be seen daily even yet in the South.\n\nCattle-lifting is a chief topic in all these poems. It was the beginning of warfare: the Raid was followed by the Rescue, and these by the organized Invasion of the enemy's country (for which another wreath was assumed). This led to the systematic defence, and the defenders assumed a different wreath. The siege and protection of forts each demanded its appropriate garland. Then came war in general, and for that another wreath was borne. And finally, the victors who had gained supremacy had another wreath, which they wore as the proud token of their victory. Thus our work relates to the expeditions in which these eight different chaplets were worn by the combatants. Some interesting chapters follow in which kings and their attributes, and miscellaneous matters connected with the life of the people, are illustrated. It is from these, as has been said, that the authors of the Kurral, the N\u0101la\u1e0diy\u0101r, and other, lesser poets drew much of their material. It must be evident, therefore, that in many respects the work we are now concerned with is an introduction to almost the whole of the genuine poetry of the Tamil language.\n\nThe thorough exposition of these chapters, which reveal to us the South Indian primitive tribes making war with one another from their hill fortresses, would require a volume. It must be remembered that in those days there were three great kingdoms of the South\u2014the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan, with Madura as its capital; the C\u014dra, with Kar\u016br as its centre; and the C\u014dra, with Urraiy\u016br as its chief town. (See my J.R.A.S. 1892.)\nBut besides these, almost every little hill had its chieftain, who sometimes considered himself subject to one or other of the great powers, but generally was independent, and sometimes even fought against them. These petty chieftains were for the most part of lower caste, if indeed caste distinctions were really recognized among them. In the greater kingdom Br\u0101hmanical influence was predominant, and was gradually leavening the whole South.\n\nThe chief tribe of what we may call the aborigines were the Marravar, or 'men of violence,' as the name signifies. They often fought as mercenaries in the armies of the greater kings. They still form a very great part of the population of the extreme South, and have no small share of the rude qualities of their ancestors.\n\nThe Demoness whom they worship was called Kottavai[\u00a720], 'the Victorious One' [in Malay\u0101lim, Kotti]. She was evidently the object of worship among the oldest peoples of the South, and is the great Demoness whose worship is performed under many names in the Devil temples which are still found in every southern village. The Br\u0101hmans have transferred her attributes to Um\u0101, the wife of \u0100ivan, and call her Durg\u0101, with whom she is now quite confounded.\u00b9 There was also a divinity, the Hill-god of all the South, who is represented as being the son of Kottavai. His name is Murugan, 'the Fragrant One.' And he has been received into the Hindu Pantheon and invested with the attributes of K\u0101rttik\u0113yan, the warrior son of \u0100ivan, and is so regarded by nearly all the rural tribes. Originally it seems quite certain that he had nothing to do with the Br\u0101hmanical deities. The student who would form an independent opinion on these subjects must read these verses in the original, comparing them with the Purra-nann\u016brru, and with the Tol-K\u0101ppya\u1e41 (Porul, 56\u201360), and with chapter 1 of the Pattu-p\u0101ttu ('ten lyrics'). Good editions of all these have been issued by\n\n\u00b9 The whole history of the myths connected with Durg\u0101 and many kindred subjects should be studied in Muir's \"Sanskrit Texts,\" vol. iv, with references to the very complete index.\n\u00c7aminathaiyar, and T\u0101motharam Pillai, veteran scholars, whose learning and industry are worthy of all praise. Of these works it is hoped that some account may hereafter be given. The dances in honour of these divinities, and especially of Murugan, are many, and are still performed. The late lamented Sundaram Pillai, in an article published in the Madras Christian College Magazine, March, 1891, has given an exceedingly interesting account of the Pattu-p\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6du, and he says: \"It seems not altogether impossible that Murugan was originally a Dravidian deity; and that in the course of time, when \u0100ryan civilization found it expedient to adopt the cult of the independent nations over which it came to exercise its influence, a place in the Pur\u0101nic mythology was found for the war god of the Tamils, as transformed and embellished by \u0100ryan genius, just as in more recent times Buddhistic institutions and even Buddha himself, under the name of Sasta, came to be absorbed into Br\u0101hmanism.\"\n\nPerhaps one of the most remarkable 'developments' that can be found anywhere is that of the idea of this Devil-dance as seen to this day in the South, into the really beautiful idea of \u00c7ivan's mystic dance giving life and blessing to the whole created universe. This, most undoubtedly, is the origin of the dance in Tillai. [See N\u0101l., 16]\n\n---\n\nPADALAM III.\n\nThe Va\u00f1ji Wreath, or Invasion of the Enemy's Territories.\n\nRaids such as have been described naturally lead to systematic invasions of the territories of those who have proved themselves such troublesome and treacherous neighbours. The injured king now declares war, or makes war without declaring it; while he and his warriors, binding the Va\u00f1ji wreaths upon their brows, go forth with their fourfold full\narray of elephants, chariots, horses, and infantry. The Va\u00f1ji is the general name for any creeping plant, such as is found on all the mountain slopes. This particular wreath is represented as composed of flowers of a yellow colour, and the plant is one whose leaves are green all the year round. It is the symbol of a race the fire of whose valour is never extinguished. It is curious that Va\u00f1ji has become the poetical name of Kar\u00fcr, the \u00c7\u0113ra capital, and it would seem that the \u00c7\u0113ra kings, of whom twelve are celebrated in the P.N.N., were remarkable for the frequency of their invasions of neighbouring territories. Being for the most part mountaineers, their energy was resistless, and we may add that their wrath was implacable. Thus in P.N.N., 4, the great poet Para\u00f1ar sings of one of these expeditions, and his song is a specimen of very many in the same work. He celebrates the sword, the jewelled anklet, the spacious shield, the fiery charger, the resistless elephant, and the towering banner-crowned chariot of a king; and thus concludes:\u2014\n\n\"Like the ruddy sun arising over the dark sea,\nart thou in thy beauty, O king!\nAnd therefore, the land of them that provoked thy wrath\nshall ceaseless mourn, foodless, and helpless,\nlike the tender infant forsaken by its mother!\"\n\n\u00a7 1. The Invasion.\n\nThe king puts on the unfading Va\u00f1ji wreath, and contemplates the subjugation of the enemy's land.\n\n[The invasion and complete subjugation of the whole southern seaboard by the famous P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dyan Nedum \u00c7eriy\u0101n is related in P. P\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6du, vi, 149, etc.]\n\nVerse 36.\n\n\"Like young bulls red-eyed\nthe youthful warriors bend their bows,\nwith glistening eyes, longing for the battle-feast; and so\nput on the Va\u00f1ji wreath, to subdue the unsubdued.\"\n\u00a7 2. The Invading Hosts.\n\nThe heroes arise in their wrath, brandishing their bright swords, amid the trumpeting of the elephant-hosts.\n\nVerse 37.\n\"The drums sound out like the roaring of the angry sea!\nWreathed with the Vaijji the valiant bands rush on.\nIn the midst of the glittering bands, like the eternal fires,\nthe elephants madly rush like black clouds in the rainy sky.\"\n\nThe following verses speak of the uplifting of the banner, and the unsheathing of the sword. Kottavai is again introduced as putting to flight the enemy's forces.\n\n\u00a7 6. The Model Hero.\n\nVerse 41.\n\"You ask how the hero distinguishes himself:\nforemost mid his kinsmen's hosts, he emulates the prowess of the bravest. Like fire he penetrates the foeman's ranks: these are the deeds of the jewel-ankleted hero.\"\n\n\u00a7 8. Woe to the Conquered.\n\nThe soldiers commiserate the sufferings of the land they overrun.\n\nVerse 43.\n\"The lotus-like eyes of the warrior, whose breast bears the warlike wreath, are wet with tears,\nas he exclaims: 'They perish, a fearful spectacle to all beholders,\u2014\nthey who erewhile rode forth with garlands gay,\nwith glistening eyes, and sound of warriors' cars.'\"\n\n\u00a7 9. The Rewards.\n\nAs they come to distribute the spoil, the question arises,\u2014\nwho of the foe shall be spared?\narray of elephants. Vanji is the genus of a plant which is found on all the mountains of India. It is represented as having a round leaf and the plant itself is round. It is thought that this plant is never extinguished by fire. The poetical name of this plant seems that the poets in the P.N.N., or the poems of invasions of northern part mountainous, add that their great poet and his song work. He called it a spacious shield and the tower thus concluded.\n\n\"Like the river art thou in And there shall cease like the tide.\"\n\nThe king templates. [The in southern is related\n\n\"Like the y with put\n\"PURRA-PORUL VENBA-MALAI.\"\n\nVerse 60.\n\n\"Where palaces like mountains reared their heads, the roar\nof the consuming fire is heard. Wild jungle plants grow\namong the ruins. The conqueror rides glorious on his lofty car,\nround which triumphing hosts flow like a mighty sea!\"\n\nThese desolating wars account for the multitudes of\ndeserted strongholds whose ruins are yet to be seen, and\nfor the comparative sparseness of the population at the\nperiod when authentic history begins. In P.N.N. twelve\nlyrics refer to this chapter. In all the poems there is a note\nof an oft-times savage ferocity. These old Dravidians were\ngreat and most implacable warriors!\n\nWhatever faults may be found with the government\nunder the Pax Britannica by peevish and restless partisans,\nwe see that the idea of a Pax Tamuliensis is a myth.\n\nPADALAM IV.\n\nThe K\u0101\u00f1ji Padalam, or the Defence of the Kingdom.\n\nThe K\u0101\u00f1ji is the Ulmus integrifolia, or elm-tree, and its\nfoliage was dark. Its flowers and leaves formed the wreaths\nworn by the defenders of an invaded country, and were\nsupposed to be indicative of a stubborn resolve to conquer\nor die. This most generally ended in the death of the\nking and the overthrow of his kingdom, and hence the\nsame word (K\u0101\u00f1ji) is used for the wreath of a minstrel\nwho inculcates moral precepts, and more especially dwells\non the instability of worldly things. The word K\u0101\u00f1ji has\nthus become a synonym for 'sober counsel,' and some of the\nverses under this heading have nothing particular to do with\nwar. The great example of this is the Madura-K\u0101\u00f1ji, an account of which will be given in the life of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan, Talai-\u0100lang\u0101nattha \u010ceruvendra Ne\u1e0dum \u010ceriy\u0101n.\n\n\u00a7 1. The K\u0101\u00f1ji Wreath.\n\nThe inhabitants of the invaded country put on wreaths of the K\u0101\u00f1ji, and retire to make a last stand in their mountain fortresses.\n\nVerse 61.\n\n\"Since there is no longer any band to withstand the foe upon the plain,\nat least we can die on the heights of our native hills!\"\nSo saying, intent upon the defence of their little mountain homes,\nthe warriors assume the K\u0101\u00f1ji wreath.\"\n\nThe following verses in the chapter illustrate the fierceness of the final struggle. Marvels of bravery are related. The heroes fall; their wives perish with them; the warrior rips open his wounds and dies on the plain; demons and demonesses brood over the gory battlefields, sometimes helping and sometimes destroying the dying men; much toddy is consumed, libations to the great demoness are poured out, and a universal wail is heard.\n\n\u00a7 19. The Elegy.\n\nPraise and pity mingle in the song as the heroes ascend to the paradise of the valiant.\n\nVerse 80.\n\n\"He was the raft on which his people sailed over the sea of battle! He was a pillar amongst the mighty! He was the life of his town, and of the world! The door of charitable deeds has been closed by the spear that tore open our leader's breast!\"\nIn P.N.N. there are forty-one lyrics, of which this gives the keynote.\n\nOther topics are introduced, but the chapter ends with the 'crushing defeat' and, it would seem, the extermination of the conquered people.\n\n---\n\nPADALAM V.\n\nTHE DEFENCE OF THE FORT.\n\nThe Nochi Wreath.\n\nThe next chapter speaks of the defence of hill-forts. When hostile kings besieged a fort its defenders were accustomed to assume a wreath of the leaves and flowers of a wild creeper called the Nochi, or 'Vitex Nirgundi.' There are many species of the Vitex, which is often called the 'five-leaved chaste tree' (see Ainslie's \"Materia Medica,\" vol. ii, p. 252). The flowers are of a pure, pale-bluish colour, and have a pleasant fragrance. This flower is very celebrated in Tamil songs. The poet M\u014dci-\u00e7attan\u0101r has sung of it very sweetly (P.N.N., 271, 272):\n\n\"Like linked gems are Nochi's curling ringlets blue!\nMid all the flowering trees is none whose tender hue\nSo fills the soul with love as thine, whose blooming wreath\nMen see the youthful maiden's slender form ensheathe,\nIn the wide guarded city,\u2014sight beloved of all.\nAnd when fierce enemies attack the moated wall,\nThe warriors on their brows thy flowers defiant show,\nAs sign they shield their virgin fort from every foe.\"\n\nIt was the symbol of chastity, and those that wore these wreaths were pledged to keep their fort inviolate. The virgin fortress guarded by warriors so adorned, laughed at its foes. Much of romance mingled with the ferocity of those ancient days!\n\u00a7 1. The Nochi.\n\nThe heroes go forth to guard their turret-crowned battlements, whence archers shoot forth their deadly arrows.\n\nVerse 86.\n\nLike the host of the Asuras, whose triple fort\nthe god with serpent crowned, and fiery form would take,\nthese warriors crowned with Nochi wreaths\nguard their strongholds, wielding the sharp-pointed dart.\"\n\nThis is one of the commonplaces of Hindu verse, here borrowed from the Mah\u0101-Bh\u0101rata. The story of the destruction of the three forts of the Asuras (or Asura) is most celebrated (see Mair's Sanskrit Texts, vol. i, p. 268, 225).\n\nThere were in the sky three cities of the valorous Asuras, one of iron, another of silver, and a third of gold, which Indra could not demolish, with all his weapons. The gods distressed, went to the great Rudra, seeking him as their refuge, and said to him:\n\n\"Rudra, there shall be victims and sacrifices. Bestower of honour, save us from these Asuras with their cities, and deliver them.\"\n\nRudra addressed, said, \"So be it\"; and he took his bow, Ashi its barb, Yama, the sorcerer, his Veda, his bowstring, and having assumed his chariot, he in due time pierced these Asuras with their cities with a three-pointed three-barbed arrow, and in fierceness like the fire These Asuras with their cities\n\n[Cf. Tiruv\u0101cagam, xiv.]\n\nThe fort was called Gana-per-\n\nIt was besieged by the\nfamous king of Madura, *Ukkira-peru-Varuthi*, of whom something will be said in the analysis of the P.N.N. The poet *Mulam-kirar* of *Aiyur* enumerates the parts of the fortification: \"There was, first of all, a moat so deep that it reached down to the abodes of the demons; next, there was a wall that rose up to the heavens; this was crowned with turrets from which the archers shot forth their arrows; there was an impervious wood that surrounded all; and there were numerous small forts at every angle.\"\n\nThe chapter contains the usual praises of the king and his warriors, relates how they fell fighting to the last: \"they desired not, these lions in the fight, to guard their bodies or their lives.\" There is also a hint that these sieges were often the result of a refusal on the part of the king to give his daughter in marriage to the leader of the besieging army.\n\n---\n\n**PADALAM VI.**\n\n**THE BESIEGERS: ATTACKING ENEMIES' STRONGHOLDS.**\n\n**The Urri\u00f1ai Wreath.** [Venb\u0101, 95\u2013126.]\n\nWhen an army marched to besiege a fort they wore a wreath of the Urri\u00f1ai (*Oerua lanatar*), a species of cotton-plant, which is mentioned in P.N.N., 50, where it is said to have 'golden shoots,' and to belong to the 'Western Country.' This seems to have been worn by our heroes in derision, implying the worthlessness and weakness of the fort they went to seize. There is little remarkable in this chapter. We are told in it that sheep were offered in sacrifice by the combatants; the exploits of Vish\u1e47u, who stormed a fort called *Vira\u00e7\u014d*, are celebrated; as also those of \u00c7ivan (as above). The encircling wood is cut down; the besiegers make rafts on which they pass the moat; scaling ladders are applied to the wall; the besiegers leap down into the area; tremendous fights take place; and the fort is taken.\n\u00a7 23. Utterly waste.\n\nThis relates how the conquerors, yoking asses, plough up the foundations of the fort, and sow worthless jungle plants upon the spot.\n\nVerse 120.\n\n\"The beautiful homes with pictured walls are levelled with the dust;\nasses are yoked to plough up the soil with spears;\nwhile worthless plants are sown on the foundations.\nThus rages the conquering king!\"\n\nOther verses tell how there is a solemn washing of their blood-stained swords in sacred waters, and their presentation as offerings. The conqueror is solemnly wedded to the newly-acquired country; neighbouring kings bring tribute; and the chapter ends with universal submission: \"They make a desert and they call it peace.\"\n\nThis subject is formally discussed in Tol-K\u0101ppyam, Poru\u1e37, 66\u201368, pp. 135\u2013146. An admirable illustration of it is found in P. P\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6du, vi, 149, etc.\n\nPADALAM VII.\n\nWAR IN GENERAL.\n\nThe Tumbai Wreath.\n\nWhen a king contemplated an offensive war he assumed a wreath of the especial war-flower, the tumbai (Phlomis Indica). This is celebrated in Sanskrit as the drona.\n\n\u00a7 1. The Wreath.\n\nVerse 127.\n\n\"The king, whose war-drum sounds like unceasing thunder from the stormy clouds,\ncontemplates war that shall bedew the battlefields with blood.\nHe has put on the warlike tumbai wreath, and leads forth his hosts eager for the glorious strife.\"\nTo these old kings the excitement of war was a necessity of life; it was only thus that the monotony of existence could be relieved. Yet the horrors of war are much dwelt upon in these verses, and the king is represented as hesitating, and only deciding upon battle when its necessity was apparent. The twenty-five verses of the chapter present, without any attempt at arrangement, many of the striking incidents of ancient war.\n\n\u00a7 2. Presents to the Troops.\n\nThe king heaps upon his chosen warriors gifts so that they go forth joyously under his banner.\n\nVerse 128.\n\n\"Badges of victory, lands, precious treasure, farms,\nmurderous elephants, and horses,\u2014the king distributes.\nHis enemies, tho' strong in horses and chariots, tremble when\nthey hear of the movements of the jewel-bearing king.\"\n\n\u00a7 3. Can the fight not be prevented?\n\nBoth armies are brave: might it not be well to avoid a struggle?\n\nVerse 129.\n\n\"Should these warriors meet on the demon-haunted battleground\nand with their polished spears begin the fight,\n't will prove the saying false, that 'glory of the king\nis guardianship of human lives.'\"\n\nPraises are now sung of the elephants, the horses, the gallant heroes, and the war chariots.\n\n\u00a7 9. The Bard's Eulogy.\n\nThe battle has been fought, and the bards on the battlefield burn or bury the dead with appropriate songs of praise.\nVerse 137.\n\n\"The tender spouse, the mother, the children know not this!\nUpon the battle plain the fiery piles are lit, the death songs sung!\nHeroes who fell beneath the elephants they slew\nhave gone to banquet with the heroes' gods!\"\n\nWhile demon shapes like fantastic shadows dance before,\nbehind, and around, the bodies of some of the slain heroes\nare carried home.\n\n\u00a7 23. Joy mingled with wailing.\n\nThe wife, seeing the body of her husband covered with\nglorious wounds, and still grasping the sword, weeps with\nproud joy.\n\nVerse 151.\n\n\"Even death is abashed, for here is valour greater than his own!\nThe wife takes the sword from the hand of her dead warrior;\nand, watching his calm triumphant repose, is glad as she\nbedews his breast with tears.\"\n\nThis ends up with her voluntary death.\n\n\u00a7 25. All died gloriously.\n\nThey perish not; their renown is established for ever,\nthough they lie strewn over the battlefield.\n\nVerse 154.\n\n\"They urged a stubborn fight alone; the two kings fell,\ngrasping still their spears; the earth is desolate!\nSwiftly their wives uprose, and threw themselves into the flames.\nBehold, even fierce death himself is satisfied.\"\n\nThis last verse seems to be a reminiscence of the history\nreferred to in P.N.N., 62, 63. There the kings were the\n\u00c7\u0113ran prince Kudakk\u014d-Nedum-\u00c7\u0113ral\u0101than, and his rival\nthe C\u014dran Peruvirral Killi, who fell on the same battlefield. Their deaths were sung by the poets Kar\u0101ttalaiy\u0101r and Para\u1e47ar.\n\nThere is power and pathos in the following dirge, by the former of these:\n\nP.N.N., 62.\n\n\"What has become of the defiant valour of these rival kings?\nDemon-Furies probe deep the wounds of the fallen heroes,\nwhile with bloody hands they besmear their dishevelled locks,\nand hovering round display their blood-stained forms.\nWith sullen sound the death-drums moan, while demons dance.\nThe kings themselves raging with heroic wrath are fallen,\nand lie amid the vultures that devour the slain.\nThe victory-vaunting kingly canopies are low, the drums\nthat erewhile announced the leaders' glory and their sway,\nlie broken there.\nOver the field, where myriads fought, a fearsome stillness broods.\nThe heroes' wives on dainties feast no more, nor bathe\nin perfumed waters, but lie dead on the bosoms of their lords.\nThey have gone to feast in the world of the gods,\nwho wear unfading wreaths from the tree of Immortality,\u2014\nwhose eyes slumber not,\u2014who eat ambrosial food.\nLet the glory of the heroes live for aye!\"\n\nThe site of this famous battle is unknown, but it is often referred to in old Tamil verse.\nPADALAM VIII.\n\nTHE CONQUEROR.\n\nTHE V\u0101gai WREATH.\n\nThe leaves and flowers of the v\u0101gai (Mimosa flectuosa), which are white, were worn by victorious kings, or any who won prizes in a competition. This chapter contains thirty-four verses, and appears at first sight to be entirely without plan or purpose; but it indicates the course of conduct which entitles anyone, of any caste or class, to the praise of his fellow-men. It is probably of later introduction. There are more conquests than men are apt to imagine. Peace has its victories, more worthy of the V\u0101gai than those of war. A few of these verses, more artificial than the preceding, throw light upon the feelings and habits of the people, and these I have given.\n\nMuch of this is from Manu (or similar works), and is the introduction of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 code into the South. We have here the four castes, Kshattriyas, Br\u0101hmans, Vaisyas, and C\u016bdras.\n\n\u00a7 2. The King\u2019s V\u0101gai. Triumphant War. The Kshattriya.\n\nThe king, returning from conquest, puts on the white v\u0101gai garland, with the dark jewelled anklets, and girds himself with a purple cincture.\n\nVERSE 156.\n\n\u201cThese were the glorious wounds I received on the battlefield; of them and sorrows we will think no more!\nBid my heroes who have overcome the fiery foe put on the victor\u2019s anklets, stainless wreath, and girdle\u2019s purple folds.\u201d\n\nEight more verses similar to those in the foregoing chapters celebrate the kingly warriors\u2019 triumph.\n\u00a7 9. The Br\u0101hmans' V\u0101gai: Sacred Rites.\n\nThe learned Br\u0101hmans celebrate their victory by offering the y\u0101gam sacrifices.\n\nVerse 163.\n\"On the land bordered by the sea, on whose borders the surges rise,\nhe who has seen the V\u0113tham's farthest shore, sits an ascetic king.\nHe, amid the praises of all, lights his sacrificial fires,\nhimself the shining light of men.\"\n\n\u00a7 10. The Merchants' V\u0101gai: Practical Life.\n\nThis speaks of the sixfold deeds of the merchant king, free from all evil.\n\nVerse 164.\n\"He ploughs and reaps the harvest; guards the lowing kine;\nsells piles of precious wares; learns lessons of sacred lore;\nperforms his daily rites with the three fires;\nscatters his gifts, nor looks for recompense:\nhe is the merchant king.\"\u00b9\n\nThese are the Vaisyas. They are the capitalists, proprietors; and the Vell\u0101lar are their servants.\n\n\u00a7 11. The Vell\u0101lar-V\u0101gai: Faithful Toil.\n\nThe C\u016bdras, or fourth caste, are those who cultivate the soil under the direction of the higher castes. Their 'triumph' (V\u0101gai) is to do the will of their lords.\n\nVerse 165.\n\"They flourish, in obedience to the three higher ranks;\naccording to the orders of these they act, and refuse no command;\nthey live according to the 'ethic' rules prescribed;\nthey plough the fields, where the beetles hum;\nthey are the life of all that live on the earth.\"\n\n\u00b9 He had a wreath, too, of the Strychnos flower.\nThe which won four plan which of hi Ther Peac thos. the of t in he C\n\n\u00a7\n\"PURRA-PORUL VENBA-MALAI.\"\n\n\u00a7 23. The Town of the Heroes: its V\u0101gai.\n\nVerse 177.\n\"Once in the village courtyard children fitted their arrows to their bows,\nto shoot the hares that gathered there. Its heroes now ward off the strokes of hostile kings, from the mighty breasts of their own leaders: such is the city now!\"\n\n\u00a7 30. Excellence is Victory. The V\u0101gai of the Good.\n\nVerse 185.\n\"They change not as in the sky the changing moon.\nThough they obtain wealth brought in ships from over the ocean,\nwill their excellence change, whose hearts are pure\nas the white conch-shell found on that ocean's shore?\"\n\n\u00a7 33. Grace in Life and Death. The final V\u0101gai.\n\nThis chapter, concerned with the conqueror's wreath, contains many verses that hardly seem to belong to the subject, and seem to be of later origin; but it ends with the following quatrain, which is meant to teach that there is no real victory but that which overcomes the world. There is an aroma of the Bhagavat G\u012bt\u0101 here.\n\nVerse 188.\n\"Before the body perishes, that long with many pains has afflicted us and bound us fast, let us escape from the net,\nwith many meshes, of the world, which is full of fear and confusion,\nand gain the right path! This alone is strength and victory.\"\n\nThus ends the eighth chapter; the eight wreaths of the warrior have been sung in order.\nPADALAM IX.\n\nROYALTY.\n\nThis chapter, in fifty-one quatrains, is supposed to treat of the duties and glories of the king and kingdom. The Kurral, ch. xxxix, contains the substance. It is entirely miscellaneous, and its topics will better be studied in connection with the Purra-nann\u016brru (cf. P.N.N., 6).\n\nA few verses illustrating the lives of these old chieftains are interesting. In P.N.N., 239, is given a picture of what to them was a 'perfect life.'\n\nTHE PARAGON.\n\n\"He wedded one with armlets decked, one fair to see;\nHe put on chaplets in the pleasant flowery park;\nHe smeared himself with fragrant sandal paste;\nHe slew his foes with all their kindred race;\nHe friends extolled and magnified;\nHomage to none he paid as mightier than himself;\nTriumphed o'er none as weaker than himself.\nHe ne'er sought aid of others as a suppliant;\nTo none that asked did he refuse his aid.\nHe shone with glory in the councils of the state;\nHe stood a bulwark 'gainst the vanguard of the foe;\nHe followed up relentlessly their fleeing host.\nHe urged his charger swiftly o'er the plain;\nRound the long course he drove the lofty car;\nHe rode aloft on mighty elephant of state;\nHe quaffed from golden bowl the sweet palm-wine;\nHe made the hearts of minstrels glad with feasts;\nHis lucid word made clear the darkest theme:\nAnd thus, all that a man may do he did!\nTake ye the head of this all-glorious one,\nCut off with sword, or burn, or let it lie\nWhere'er you will; his glory is secure.\"\n\nThe king was Nambi Nedum \u010ceriy\u0101n, evidently a king of Madura in very ancient days. He is mentioned nowhere else. The minstrel was Murrucalar (\"the laughing one\") of P\u00e9reyil (see notes on v. 36), and this is his only remaining song.\nThe following beautiful verse (P.N.N., 245) is by M\u0101-K\u014dthai, the \u010c\u0113ran king, on the death of his queen:\n\n\"My sorrow swelling knows no bounds, but hath not strength\nto free me from this loathed life! I bore her forth\nto burning ground, where Kalli\\(^1\\) spreads; there on the fire\nI saw the fuel heaped; I laid her on her couch\nof rising flame! The innocent in soul hath died,\nand left me here! What charm hath life henceforth\nfor me?\"\n\nThese kings not unfrequently renounced their kingdoms\nand became ascetics. This is referred to in the two following\nsongs. (P.N.N., 251, 252.)\n\n**The King has renounced his Kingdom and become an Ascetic.**\n\n\"We saw erewhile the king within his pictured home\nweaving gay garlands for the happy mountain maids;\nbut now, upon the mountains in the bamb\u016b brake\namid the waterfalls, he dwells, and lights his fire\nwith wood\\(^2\\) the elephants have brought\nand dries his tangled hair.\"\n\n\"Amid the roaring cataracts he makes his way;\nhis hue is changed; his locks are brown as Tillai buds.\nHe plucks the creepers' sacred flowers.\\(^3\\) But erst he wove\nthe net of courtly words that took the simple hearts\nof the fair maidens in his stately palace-home.\"\n\nThe following lyric (P.N.N., 243), which strikes a chord\nthat will vibrate in many hearts, was Tod\u012b-lalai Vi\u1e5fu-Tan\u1e0din\u0101r, one of the bards of the ancient Madura College.\n\n\"I muse of YOUTH! the tender sadness still\nreturns! In sport I moulded shapes of river sand,\nplucked flowers to wreath around the mimic forms:\nin the cool tank I bathed, hand linked in hand,\nwith little maidens, dancing as they danced!\n\n\\(^1\\) A kind of Euphorbium, abundant in desolate places.\n\\(^2\\) Wild elephants serve the holy ascetic.\n\\(^3\\) The T\u0101\u1e6di, a convolvulus, sacred to \u010civan. (See Tiruv\u0101\u00e7agam, xix, 36.)\nA land of innocence, we knew no guile.\nI plunged beneath th' o'erspreading myrtle's shade,\nwhere trees that wafted fragrance lined the shore;\nthen climbed the branch that overhung the stream,\nwhile there upon the bank stood wondering;\nI threw the waters round, and headlong plunged,\ndrew deep beneath the stream, and rose,\nmy hands filled with the sand that lay beneath!\nSuch was my youth unknown'd. 'Tis too sad!\nWhere-does of youth, ah! whither have they fled?\nI now with trembling hands, grasping my staff,\npanting for breath, gasp few and feeble words.\nThus I am worn and OLD!\"\n\n[Cf. N\u0101ladiy\u0101r, ch. ii.]\n\nThe young prince to whom this was sung was Perum\n(son-in-law of Olli-\u016br), whose dirge (P.N.N., 242) was sung\nby Y\u0101ll\u0101n\u0101n\u016br. It is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"The youths wear garlands bright no more;\nthe damsels gather flowers no more;\nthe bard puts wreaths around his lyre no more;\nthe sageless gay adorns herself no more!\nWho is he who with his mighty spear\nconquers and slew great heroes, triumphed so!\nWho is he who flourishes still in land of Olli-\u016br?\"\n\nPADALAM X, XI, XII.\n\nEXTRAVAGANZA.\n\nThere are chapters that a kind of appendix, into which\nmuch has been thrown that belongs properly to the other\nchapters of the work. There are, however, a few\npassages that throw light upon the ancient history of the\nwarriors. We have seen the warriors crowned with eight\ndifferent flowers. There are three flowers worn only by\n\u00a7 1. The Palmyra Wreath of the \u00c7\u0113ra.\n\nThe \u00c7\u0113ra king, when he went forth to war, assumed a wreath of the flowers of the palmyra-tree,\\(^1\\) which flourished most in the lands over which he then held sway.\n\nVerse 240.\n\n\"By the gushing waters of the hill of Kolli,\\(^2\\) where the K\u0101nthal\\(^3\\) spreads its leaves like a canopy, the V\u0101navan\\(^4\\) crowns his brows with the cool blue lotus; when he goes forth to war his wreath is the palmyra-flower.\"\n\n\u00a7 2. The Margosa Wreath of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan. V\u0113mbu.\n\nThe P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan wears the Margosa\\(^5\\) wreath when he goes forth to battle.\n\nVerse 241.\n\n\"The great Varuthi,\\(^6\\) the guardian just, the horseman swift, who leads forth a valiant host of stout warriors crowned with Tumbai, when he goes out to fight, with bannered chariot dreaded by his foes, crowns himself with the V\u0113mbu wreath, praised by all.\"\n\n\u00a7 3. The \u0100tti\\(^7\\) Wreath of the C\u014dran.\n\nThe \u0100tti is the wreath worn in war by the '\u00c7embiyan.'\n\nVerse 242.\n\n\"The garland of the king of the land of K\u0101v\u014dri's rushing flood, where heroes go forth on elephants, wielding the murderous sword, decked with the jewelled anklets, and brandishing their spears, is the \u0100tti.\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Borassus flabelliformis.\n\n\\(^2\\) A range of hills in the Salem district, belonging to the \u00c7\u0113ra kingdom.\n\n\\(^3\\) Gloriosa superba.\n\n\\(^4\\) The 'heavenly': an epithet of \u00c7\u0113ra kings.\n\n\\(^5\\) The Nim, V\u0113mbu: Melia Azadirachta (Lin.). In Portuguese 'Amar-goeira' and corrupted into Margosa. See my N\u0101la\u1e0diy\u0101r Lex. (in loc.).\n\n\\(^6\\) An epithet of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diyan = 'shining.'\n\n\\(^7\\) \u0100tti (Bauhinia racemosa), called also \u0100r. It is worn by \u00c7ivan.\nIn Dr. Hultzsch's \"Epigraphia Indica,\" vol. iv, Nos. 22, 23, 52, are given three Tamil inscriptions found at Kil-Muttugur (\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb3\u0bcd-\u0bae\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd), in North Arcot, of which one records the death of a hero who fell while rescuing some cattle that had been lifted (\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bc8 \u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bc8 \u0bae\u0bc0\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd). The stone bears the effigy of the hero in relief. Some of these fallen warriors have offerings by their side. So in P.N.N., 232, ascribed to Avvai, it is said:\n\n\"Let change of morn and eve for ever cease,\nand all my days of earthly life be done! For, ah!\nthe stone stands there with feathers bright.\nWill he accept libations poured\u2014he wont to give\nto all that asked\u2014who now receives no gift bestowed?\"\n\nThere are many songs in P.N.N. bearing upon the same subject, and the photographs we possess of those recovered stones would be the most appropriate illustration of these verses.\n\nIn chapter x there are several verses which speak of the honour due to departed heroes. Surviving comrades seek far and wide for a suitable stone to place over the hero's ashes; this stone is brought to the spot with great processions; it is then washed and consecrated; and finally inscribed with the hero's name and exploits.\n\n\u00a7 10. The Setting up of the Stone.\n\nVerse 251.\n\n\"While garlands wave, jewels tinkling sound, and fragrant smoke goes up,\nthey pour forth libations of toddy, crown the stone with peacock feathers, and inscribe it with their hero's name,\nadding:\n'This is the memorial of him who thirsted for the fight,\nfull of valour, amid the hurling of the spears.'\"\n\nIn some cases shrines were built, where the departed heroes were honoured. It would appear that while many\nwidows died with their husbands, this was generally a kind of suicide, and not a formal \u00e7ati. The \u00e7ati was, however, frequent, and in the P.N.N. Br\u0101hmans are spoken of as striving to hinder it, but in no case as prompting it. The life of the widow as depicted here is one of absolute asceticism, and to escape this many sought death.\n\nWe read (P.N.N., 246) of the Suttee (\u00c7ATI), and this is hinted at in many of the verses.\n\nThe word \u00c7at\u012b (\u0938\u0924\u0940)\u00b9 is Sanskrit, and means a virtuous woman; but has been specialized to denote one who burns on the funeral pyre with her deceased husband. There is no word in Tamil equivalent to it, nor is the custom at all consonant to the feelings of the Tamil people. It was purely a Br\u0101hmanical idea. Yet there are evidences in the old Tamil poetry that the widow felt herself a poor miserable outcast, and often sought relief in suicide. Many beautiful stanzas give utterance to this feeling. The tenderest affections of the human heart have often been perverted, and in this case the awful scenes of what in English we call the suttee had such an origin. Yet we must believe that in most cases the immolation was purely voluntary on the part of the victim\u2014the result of over-exalted feeling. In the following verse the Br\u0101hmans and kindred of the despairing woman had attempted to dissuade her from the sacrifice; she replies to their urgent expostulations:\n\nP.N.N., 246.\n\n\"O ye of wisdom full! O ye of wisdom full!\nYe bid us not go forth to death; ye would restrain;\nO ye of wisdom full, but evil is your counsel here!\nWe're not of those content to live forlorn,\nand feed on bitter herbs, where once they feasted royally.\nWe lie not on rough stones, who slept erewhile on sumptuous couch.\n\n\u00b9 The Skt. word \u00c7akti (in Tamil \u00c7atti) is the name of \u00c7ivan's 'energy' (see note 8 to life of M\u0101nikka V\u0101\u00e7agar), or bride, Umai, who is also called \u00c7ati, and hence the words are often confounded.\nIn Dr. Hultzsch's \"Epigraphia Indica,\" vol. iv, Nos. 22-52, are given three Tamil inscriptions found at Kil-Muttu (\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb3\u0bcd-\u0bae\u0bc1\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1), in North Arcot, of which one records the death of a hero who fell while rescuing some crows that had been lifted (\u0b95\u0bca\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0bca\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc7\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b89\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4). The stone bears the effigy of the hero in relief. Some of these fallen warriors have offerings by their side. In P.N.N., 232, ascribed to Avvai, it is said:\n\n\"Let change of morn and eve for ever cease,\nand all my days of earthly life be done! For, ah!\nthe stone stands there with feathers bright.\nWill he accept libations poured\u2014he wont to give\nto all that asked\u2014who now receives no gift bestow.\"\n\nThere are many songs in P.N.N. bearing upon this subject, and the photographs we possess of those stones would be the most appropriate illustrations.\n\nIn chapter x there are several verses which are honour due to departed heroes. Surviving coevals far and wide for a suitable stone to place over the ashes; this stone is brought to the spot with ceremonies; it is then washed and consecrated and inscribed with the hero's name and exploits.\n\n\u00a7 10. The Setting up of the Stone\n\nVerse 251.\n\n\"While garlands wave, jewels tinkling sound,\nsmoke goes up,\nthey pour forth libations of toddy, crown the peacock feathers, and inscribe it with adding:\n'This is the memorial of him who thirsted full of valour, amid the hurling of the spears.'\n\nIn some cases shrines were built, where heroes were honoured. It would appear\ndainties, and she enumerates especially the various kinds of rare fish taken from the royal ponds, for the banquet which she was wont to arrange; but now,\n\n\"The lady pure of heart, of radiant brow,\nsince HE has gone\u2014entered the heavenly home\u2014\nsweeps a little spot free from ashes,\nand washes it with thickly falling tears!\"\n\nShe is placing in the burial-ground the offerings of food (Pindam) prescribed for the departed ones.\n\n'The Sepulchral Urn' is the title of a chapter in Dr. Caldwell's \"History of Tinnevelly,\" pp. 279-282. The subject of South Indian sepulchral urns is there discussed as far as the facts were then known. The learned author gives the Tamil word for 'urn' as T\u0101li. It is so pronounced by rustics in Tinnevelly, but the real word is T\u0101ri (\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bbf). He thinks that these, as found in various parts of the country, are relics possibly of an antiquity higher than the Christian Era; and he states that \"No relic, trace, or tradition of such a mode of sepulture has survived to the present day.\" But in the Purra-n\u0101nn\u016bru (p. 228), and in other places, these urns are mentioned as used in the burial of heroes and kings at a period certainly not earlier than the eighth century A.D.\n\nA lyric addressed to the C\u014dran king, Killi-Va\u013cuvan, by Mudavan\u0101r of Aiy\u016br (\"the lame bard of Aiy\u016br\"), is as follows:\n\n\"O potter-chief! 1 maker of vessels!\nThou whose furnace sends up thick clouds\nof smoke veiling the outspread heavens,\nwho makest vessels for the wide extended ancient town!\nThou art to be pitied! What toil hath befallen thee!\nThe descendant of C\u014dra kings,\nwhose armies spread themselves to earth's utmost verge,\u2014\nwhom minstrels praise,\u2014the truly glorious one,\u2014\nwhose glory shines afar,\nas in the heavens the sun with resplendent ray,\u2014\n\n1 It is curious that the title Ko = 'king, chief,' belongs also to potters.\nValavan, the great, on the brows\nof whose warrior elephants bright banners wave,\u2014\nhath gained the world of gods. And so\n'Tis thine to shape an urn, so vast\nThat it shall cover the remains of such an one.\nBut if thou wouldest mould the needful urn,\nthe vast earth must be thy wheel,\nand mighty M\u0113ru sufficeth not for earth to mould its form!\"\n\nThe Bishop says that at the time when these urns were used cremation must have been unknown, and burial the universal practice; but the two customs have ever existed side by side. The ancient inhabitants generally buried their dead, as will be seen by a careful study of Purra-Perul-Venb\u0101; but Br\u0101hmaical and \u010caivite usages were found side by side, from very early times, throughout the South. It will be seen also by a reference to these two works (which are a mine of information regarding the ancient manners and customs of the southern lands), and from passages scattered through the other Tamil classics, that when heroes fell in battle they were often buried on the spot, and their effigies in stone placed over the grave. The same was often done when kings and other great men retired into some lonely region (generally specified as the 'North'), and died there. This is exemplified in the very touching histories of the king K\u014d-perum-\u00e7\u014dran and his devoted friends Pottiy\u0101r and Pi\u00e7ir\u014dn. This illustrates also Kurral, ch. lxxviii, 1.\n\n\"Ye foes! stand not before my lord! for many a one\nWho did my lord withstand now stands in stone!\"\n\nHere the learned commentator, Parim\u0113lar\u0101gar, remarks that when heroes died on the field of battle, it was the custom to place their effigies on the spot where they fell. These heroes often became tutelary divinities, or demons, and were worshipped with offerings of food and flowers.\nIn Purra-n\u0101nn\u016bru, song 218, the subject of worthy friendship is beautifully illustrated in connection with this topic. The renowned K\u014d-perum-\u00e7\u014dran, who reigned in Urraiy\u016br, renounced his kingdom, went 'to the north' (the banks of the Ganges?), and died there. His most intimate friends, Pottiy\u0101r and Pi\u00e7ir\u0101nthaiy\u0101r, who were not his subjects, shared his hermit cell, and all three after death were commemorated by stones placed side by side over their urns. The poet Ka\u1e47\u1e47agan\u0101r, visiting the spot, sang as follows:\n\n\"Red gold, and coral, pearls, and rare\nGems the mighty mountains bare,\u2014\nRemote their homes in sea or mine;\u2014\nIf once the precious things combine,\nAnd men in costly shapes entwine,\nHenceforth in blended beauty one they shine.\nSo worthy men with worthy side by side\nRemain; the worthless with the worthless bide.\"\n\nThe history of these three, as traced in P.N.N., is the favourite Tamil illustration of faithful friendship. (See Pope's Kurral, ch. lxxix.) In N\u0101la\u1e0di also, chs. xxi\u2013xxiv, many exquisite thoughts on friendship are to be found.\n\nWe hope to give more of these ballads at another time.\nART. IX.\u2014The Initiative of the Avesta. By the Rev. Professor Mills, D.D.\n\nI have announced as my subject in these introductory lectures\u00b9 the general relation of the Avesta to other systems of theology and philosophy. And I have especially mentioned its interest for Biblical criticism, because a relation, or a supposed relation, between the Avesta and Exilic and post-Exilic books of the Old Testament has been notorious for half a century.\n\nWe cannot, however, so well judge of the relation between the Scriptures and the Avesta until we know to some further extent what each of them is in its relation to other creeds; and, as is usual in similar cases, our knowledge as to each grows with our knowledge of the other, the stones on one side of the arch supporting those opposite. We do not yet know the Avesta in all its analogies until we know more of the Bible, and we can hardly be said to be fit to expound the Bible with ultimate opinions, until we can answer conscientiously the question as to how closely it may have been connected with the lore of the Avesta, or with some older system, out of which certain features in both the Avesta and the Exilic scriptures sprang.\n\nIf this supposed original faith were the only subject under discussion its examination would be very desirable indeed; how much more worthy of investigation that sister lore of\n\n\u00b9 This article was read as curtailed on October 20th last, at the Indian Institute in Oxford, as an inaugural to the Professorship of Zend Philology in the University. This lecture was also delivered as curtailed on December 13, 1898, at a meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society.\nthe Avesta becomes when strong reasons exist which point to an immediate and historical connection.\n\nBut in order to approach this part of the entire theme, it is naturally necessary to examine beforehand what it really is as regards those particulars where its connection with other systems becomes of special interest.\n\nI proceed to state the items in a synoptic manner, quite unadorned, pausing only to say that a relation between the Avesta and any other literature may consist in an inherent parallelism without any immediate historical connection; or, again, it may be an analogy which has resulted from an actual external influence; and the first is quite as important as the last, and in some respects more so.\n\nThe most striking feature in the lore of the ancient Avesta is the advanced intellectual tone of much of its terminology. We take up the documents which originated, as we believe, in ancient Bactria, or slightly to the north-west of it, and some 700 (?) to 1,200 years B.C. We open the texts, and what do we find in a book originating from such a place and at such a time? The locality had long been settled indeed, but we naturally suppose it to have been rough in its social and political features. At the very beginning of the G\u0101thas, however, we see expressions which may be fairly said to be technical in a philosophical-religious sense: they are such as \"the bodily life and the mental\"; and \"in thought, in word, and in deed\" as the lines for the analyses of character, \"the laws by which at the first this world into being entered,\" etc.\n\nThis terminology, if recurring only rarely in these especial forms, is yet of very great exegetical importance, for it controls the exegesis of the G\u0101thas as to some capital particulars; it shows that we should expect the more subtle and less realistic idea in various places throughout\n\n---\n\n1 And I would remind the reader that this present writing is merely a popular delineation.\n\n2 It being universally difficult to fix more closely the dates of such documents; compare the differences in opinion as to the age of Homer, of the Rig Veda, etc.\nthem, whereas we should be in doubt as to the existence of these ideas in very many passages were it not for these remarkable, if somewhat widely separated, occurrences. And they are, of course, important to a history of intellectual development, as showing a capacity to define conceptions in this refined manner at a time prior to other attempts, and in a place and under circumstances amidst which one might least expect to find such a state of things. Where in all the then extant literature of which we have any certain knowledge can such penetrating distinctions be found?\n\nIt is generally conceded that Zarathushtra antedated the earliest of the speculative Greeks who philosophised at all on his lines;\u00b9 and if ancient Iran was not as bereft of intellectual culture as we naturally suppose it to have been, the possibility that it was not thus untutored is only shown by this very terminology and the other related characteristics. Here, then, is a hegemony in intellect as to this particular, so far as I can see.\n\nIf there were not a mechanical historical priority, so to speak, in the actual dates of the enouncement of these distinctions and all that they implied, then there was indeed a rational priority, if not an actual isolation, in the appearance of such an advanced development as arising out of such apparently unpromising antecedents, and maintaining itself in despite of the still persisting concomitant circumstances. Unless we deny that the Rig Veda is closely related to the Avesta (so that they belong almost together in such a discussion as this), where do we find such a refined system arising out of an unknown abyss, and where in the early Rk itself do we find such astonishing discriminations? Also, the altogether remarkable grouping of those abstract names which afterwards became the Amesha Spends, although loosely traceable in the Rig Veda, is a proof of the advanced development. Imagine a people almost in Middle Asia, whose gods were Benevolence,\n\n\u00b9 Putting the death of Heraclitus at 470-478 B.C.\nJustice, Government, Devotion, Healthful Weal, and Deathless Long-life;\u2014the words speak for themselves\u2014what a public there must have been in early Iran to make such terms possible. And if these distinctions marked an epoch in the history of thought, how much more do they mark an epoch in the history of religious, or philosophical-religious, thought. Take their chief feature, dualism.\n\nWhether they were anterior, posterior, or contemporaneous with certain parts of the Rig Veda, they show a startling advance upon the state of theological opinion as to this subject which prevails in those richly poetical productions. The mixed elements in the recognized characters of deities have all been sifted out. Nothing at all corresponding either to an Indian Indra or a Greek Hercules (or Zeus for the matter of that) is any longer visible in the G\u0101thas.\n\nAhura Mazda is a spiritual God (in the G\u0101thas) even more bereft of anthropomorphic paganism than the early Jewish Yahveh in some of His manifestations. All conceivable good is gathered and centred in Him (the Good God), Ahura, and all conceivable evil is gathered in Angra Mainyu; a polarity of thought becomes pronounced; and the most marked theological dualism which has ever been formulated presents itself: the Good God could not prevent the evolution of evil characteristics in the beings whom He created, nor could the evil force prevent the evolution of what is good.\n\nSurely this was no trivial phenomenon. It seems to me to have been eminently important and decidedly hard-headed. It gathered up all those elements of dualism which had been recognized in all religions previously, and which have been recognized in other religions ever since. Even our Christianity must acknowledge that the possibility of evil inheres in the possibility of good, it being inconceivable that God Himself could have made a world without it; it is the most commonplace of questions. But no one had at any previous period of time pretended to state its chief condition so bluntly as Zarathushtra. Instead of saying, with a contradiction in terminology, \"there is an\nAlmighty God who was powerless to create a universe without sin,\" he simply cut the matter short; there was no such being (so he thought) in such a sense almighty that He could have undone the fundamental laws of morals and of anterior logic (in the Hegelian sense). If a supreme God could have avoided the toleration of misery in the existing universe, it is difficult to see how He could have been good if He had not in fact so avoided it.\n\nThere was a 'limit' in the very nature of things which made unmixed prosperity an impossibility\\(^1\\) as well as unalterable holiness. The texts do not go into the details which I have mentioned, but there were two great limited forces, and they are described naturally enough (after the fashion of the time) as personal: \"There were two original spirits.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n\"Thus are the spirits primeval who as twain by their deeds are famed;\nIn thought, in word, and in deed, a better they two and an evil.\nOf these let the wise choose aright; choose ye not as the evil-minded!\n\n\"Then those spirits, created as first they two came together,\nLife and non-life, decreeing how all at the last shall be,\nordered;\nThe worst life, at last, of the wicked, but to the righteous the better mind.\"\n\nThen cf. Y., xlv, 1:\n\n\"Thus forth I announcing speak this life's first two spirits,\nOf whom the more bounteous thus the evil accosted:\n'Never our thoughts, nor creeds, nor understandings;\nNever our beliefs, nor words, nor yet our actions,\nNor can our souls, or faiths, ever be one!'\"\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It could not be defined and so 'perceived.'\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Y., xxx, 3.\n\\(^3\\) A repudiation par eminence.\nThe 'mixture' was abhorrent to their keen logic, and the word became later a term of derision. Whether true or false, and as much so if true as if false, the doctrine was important. Somebody had to propose it, and no-one at that period had ever dreamed of stating it so boldly, nor has any analogous suggestion been put in clearer light. But the speculative interest is surpassed by the moral. If we could trust ourselves to a literal translation of the G\u0101thas, we should be quite astounded at the singular depth of their tone, considering their age, or, we might almost say, without any particular consideration either as to their age or circumstances.\n\nThe literal words express almost the enthusiasm of a religious brotherhood, and they have been considered the most marked productions of antiquity in this respect aside from our Semitic scriptures.\u00b9 Those who from want of knowledge care less for them have betrayed their own sense of their extraordinary moral elevation by finding fault with its recurring expression; yet this is exactly that which we should recognise as a priceless quality, even if it were produced at the total sacrifice of rhetorical animation. It is, however, true that this vivacity cannot be given up, and for a curious reason. Strange as it may appear, in one light fortunately and in another unfortunately, we are not always permitted to accept the plain recurring words in their first and obvious sense. If we were we should be well content to accept even a far larger measure of iteration than that which some superficial observers object to in these hymns, for we should have the words 'holiness,' 'benevolence,' 'ruling power,' and 'devotion' recurring at every turn with a resulting effect so remarkable as to recoup us for the surrender of every claim to rhetorical point and life; but unhappily (or happily) we cannot lay claim to the right to render the words always exactly in their natural meaning. Facts show that the clear terms may sometimes be taken in a realistic sense, as referring to persons or to the community, although their literal meaning includes no\n\n\u00b9 See the Critical Review, Jan., 1896.\nsuch idea; and it is our ungrateful task to try to break down their supreme morality, gaining therefore more historical detail. We must do all that it is possible for us to do to show that the terms do not always convey an actual meaning which corresponds to their literal force; and just in so far as we can give them an application to the scenes of the contemporaneous experience, just in so far we gain brightness of colour to our picture, while we sacrifice to a corresponding degree the depth of the thought. And we can indeed make out that the composer was at times talking of men when we had thought that he was talking of principles, of the State when we had thought that he was talking of holiness. But our victory is very far from being complete; for believe as we may that he often used the name of a principle, such as the 'good mind,' 'righteousness,' 'devotion,' or 'rule,' to designate certain good men, holy communities, devoted partisans, or government officials, we can yet never get rid of the deep sentiment which pervades the whole; for the good 'men' were only alluded to as constituent members of a sanctified community, dear to Zoroaster as holy church is to a Catholic, and the enthusiasm for a holy race was a passion deep as the Jewish, because it could save the soul.\n\nTo illustrate for a moment. If he spoke of holiness and meant by it the church, it was of course only the church as an 'embodied holiness' (which, wonderful to say, was one of his own expressions). If he spoke of the 'good mind' and meant by it the 'good man,' it was because the individual member of a beneficent community was, after all, the only object in which a sane benevolence became real; if he spoke of the 'ruling power' and meant by it (as we indeed often do) the administration, or the army, it was because he viewed authority as the inexorable condition of prosperity, national or individual, spiritual, moral, and material, and because it was only made actual in the executive of his religious nation; and so of the other sometimes personified ideas. After all our iconoclasm these concepts remain what they have been declared to be, and\nthat is pre-eminent in the history of the moral sense, so far as we know of that history up to their approximately estimated date.\n\nAs the embodiment of the great moral ideas in different representative classes or individuals among the community by no means eliminates the moral force from them, neither does their full supranatural personification in sub-gods or archangelic beings extinguish the vitality of the principle, though hypostatisation in my opinion introduces a lower stage.\n\nAnd as a technical phenomenon, this personification of the main ideas of Zoroastrianism seems also to mark an era in religious mental development, and I might indeed have touched upon it while dwelling upon the speculative interest, but its place is on the whole here, as it involves a strong moral element. Of course, a quasi-personification of similar abstracts appears often in the Rk of the Veda, and we may safely admit (or indeed claim) that wherever the mental habit became set toward the poetical personification of religious principles, an analogous development took place; but where do we find it so clearly defined as in the Avesta? Ahura addresses Asha, the 'personified holiness of the law,' and \"Asha to Him makes answer.\" The saint prays, \"O Asha, when shall I see thee?\" and the same of the Good Mind. Aramaiti, the ready mind of devoted zeal, is likewise addressed in the vocative, and she is termed Ahura's daughter, while all the leading four are bidden to listen and to come:\n\n\"Ye, the most bounteous Mazda Ahura, and Piety with Him,\nAnd Asha the settlement furth'ring, thou Good Mind,\nand thou the Dominion,\nHear ye me, all, and have mercy for all deeds which I do whatsoever.\"\n\nIn the later Avesta the personification of these powers or attributes becomes quite the predominant usage, issuing in one passage of a truly sublime type, where the souls of the seven 'Immortals' are represented as being of the \"same\nthought and word and deed, seeing each other thinking of good thoughts and words and deeds; having one father and commander, Ahura Mazda.\"\u00b9 To be sure, a deterioration becomes apparent later on, and it is indeed foreshadowed in the earlier parts of the later Avesta, if not possibly in the G\u0101thas themselves, but this does not alter the curious interest of the circumstance. The thoughts, words, and deeds of the supreme good God are naturally qualified by adverbs; He speaks with His truth, acts with His benevolence, and rules with His authority; but how interesting it is in the light of technical philosophical history to see this truth, this benevolence, this authority treated as personal subjects subordinate to Him and yet closely related to Him. The fact that this hypostatisation does not totally emasculate the virility of the ideas, I have already asserted on the same authority which supports us in defending their application to the human individual and to functions among the people. If the Zoroastrian felt that Asha, the holiness of the law, was more actual as holiness when he thought of it as alive within a community who were striving to live up to it, with what emotion must he have adored an archangelic Being whom he thought existed, and for the purpose of making his holiest ideals real. Surely it must have helped him to love the law better when he believed that there was a mighty spirit close in the presence of Ahura, whose separate function it was to watch and help on the universe in obeying that law, and who to this end especially furthered its proclamation and confirmed its influence in populations and within the moral sense of individual men. And so of the Benevolence, Government, and Devoted-zeal. All these noble concepts were the thoughts of God, but as such alone they might have been impaired by confusion in their effect upon our limited receptivity, and each might be lost in the other; the Archangels embodying each of them severally kept them apart for us. They remind us at once of the Greek\n\n\u00b9 Yasht, xiii, 83.\nlogos with the daimones of Plato and the Stoics, and they recall the dynameia of Philo and the aeons of the Gnostics; but the Zoroastrian development was vastly earlier, for it was closely allied to the Vedic, as I have already hinted. Surely this hypostatisation is a feature of signal value.\n\nThe personification of mental abstracts appeared in rough Bactria hundreds, or decades at least, of years before an analogous development took place in the most favoured land of the ancient West.\n\nWe cannot say that the Ameshaspenta were distinctly termed 'emanations' from the Deity; nor can they be said in more theological terminology to 'proceed' from either a Father or a Son, but that 'truth' with which God speaks 'proceeds' from Him, and when at the next step this truth is called a 'person,' to establish a more obvious means of communication with the Almighty, the resulting ideas constitute something which is indistinguishable in its effect, but not in its motive\\(^1\\) from the Platonic, Stoic, and Philonian analoga.\n\nAs to the practical virtues in social life, it is hardly necessary to particularize. That justice was urged needs not to be asserted, while vindictive retribution is perhaps too emphatically insisted upon. Benevolence has been already mentioned; either the love of God is expressed or His delighted good wish for us; and it was, of course, to be imitated. Mercy toward enemies cannot be traced, but the Avesta seems to afford the earliest examples of charity to the poor in an organized shape.\n\n\"Your rule, what is it? Your riches? how I may be Your own in my actions,\nThrough Righteousness and Thy Good Mind, to nourish Your poor in their sufferings;\nForemost of all we declare You, before Demons and demonised men.\"\n\nYasna, xxxiv, 9.\n\n\\(^1\\) The motive of the Platonic emanation was the impurity of matter which God could not touch without an intermediary, an idea radically opposed to Zoroastrianism.\n\"Thine is the Kingdom whence to poor and right-living\nThou givest, Lord, better.\"\n\nYasna, liii, 8.\n\nAnd in Vendidad, xxi, which deals in supernatural imagery,\nwe read of a spiritual heavenly home, which seems especially\nto exist for the purpose of combating diseases; and the idea\nmay have been new to literature.\n\nAmong domestic virtues, respect to parents stood high,\nfor the question is asked at Yasna, xliv, 3, \"Who hath made\ndutiful the son to the father?\"\n\nThe bestowal of significant names came into vogue in\na manner which reminds of Puritan England or New\nEngland. Pouruchista, 'the much taught one,' shows how\nthe generation affected pious training; it reminds us also,\nof course, of uses which were subsequent to original\nZoroastrianism, but which as regards us were still early\nOrientalism.\n\nThe virtues of home life are beautifully touched upon\nin the bridal song in Yasna, liii,\u00b9 and in correspondence with\nthese moral features in temporal life there was a judgment\nin store for those who failed in attaining them.\n\n\"Thus I'll conceive thee, bounteous, Ahura Mazda,\nAs in creation's birth I foremost saw Thee,\nWhen deeds, most just, rewarding, and words Thou givest\nIll to the evil, pure blessing to the good.\nBy Thy great virtue in this world's last change!\n\nIn which last changing Thou a spirit bounteous\nComest with Thy Good Mind and Thy Kingdom, Mazda,\nBy deeds of whom the settlements in Right are furthered\nLaws unto these to teach Armaiti striveth,\nLaws of Thy holy Realm which none deceives.\"\n\nYasna, xliii.\n\n\u00b9 \"Let each one the other devotedly cherish; so the home shall be happy.\"\n\"The initiative of the Avesta.\"\n\n\"Who e'er to me, be he or man or woman,\nOur tribe's gift gives which Thou as best perceivest,\nPrize for the holy gives with good men's ruling,\nWhom praising You I urge as comrade leading,\nForth to the Judge's Bridge with all I go.\"\n\nYasna, xlvi, 10.\n\nSo in Yasna, xlix, 3\u2014\n\n\"These give I safest, Lord, in Thy protection,\nMen living yet, and souls of saints on high;\"\n\nand again of the evil\u2014\n\n\"Then evil rulers, evil doers, speakers,\nThose believing ill and spirits evil minded,\nWith poisoned food the souls to meet are coming,\nIn Falsehood's home at last their bodies lie.\"\n\nAnd as quite an astonishing fact these rewards and punishments are subjective; the retribution is in the soul's own self; compare Yasna, xxxi, 21, where it is said, \"This be your world, O ye foul; by your deeds your own souls will bring it.\"\n\n\"Cursed by their souls and selves,\nTheir being nature, ever in\nDemon's home their dwelling is.\"\n\nYasna, xlvi, 11.\n\nAnd to show the continuity of the doctrine, the external particulars, which, though scattered, were yet so plainly marked in the G\u0101thas, are preserved and restored in the later but still genuine Avesta. There lost souls come to meet the condemned man as well with poisoned food and reviling words; pleasing features are, however, first detailed. In a passage which has been greatly admired, the man's own conscience comes to meet his soul under the form of a beatified being. The saint is bewildered, and asks, \"Who art thou?\"; and she answers, \"I am thyself; thy good thoughts and words and deeds.\" The soul, incredulous, like the one in the Gospels, inquires, \"Who hath desired thee\nhither with his love?\" She answers, \"Thou hast called me hither,\" and she recites his good deeds, one of which is, curiously enough, exactly the same as in St. Matthew: \"Thou didst care for the stranger coming from near and from afar.\"\u00b9\n\nFancy such expressions occurring in remote Iran some centuries before Christ (if only a few), and, as proved from the passages cited, evidently repeating details which had been formulated still earlier! The matter is more fully traced out in the Vendidad,\u00b2 where the evil are dragged to Hell, and where Vohu Manah, the Archangel of Benevolence, arises like Christ from his golden throne to meet the saved man, who passes on to endless bliss. We may have had adumbrations of the like, as I suppose, in other ancient religious systems, but to no degree like this; it was a realistic picture frescoed upon the religious imagination.\n\nWhether it was (together with other highly coloured delineations as to resurrection, etc.; see below) the original of Daniel's Judgment scene, depicted in what might be called a Jewish-Persian book, or whether they both proceeded from an earlier original, are propositions which can never be definitively proved nor refuted.\n\nThe golden thrones of the Ameshaspentas recall the thrones of the apostles in the Apocalypse, and in view of the 'consummation' the saints strive with holy emulation to bring on Frashakard, which was the 'restitution of' all things.\u00b3\n\nThose features in eschatology which have less of the moral point in them are also represented, and perhaps in a manner even more advanced than they are in the New Testament; the righteous dead arise, and enter upon a life\n\n\u00b9 \"When saw I thee a stranger,\" etc., the soul asks; and the answer is, \"Inasmuch as ye did it,\" etc.\u2014Matt., xxv, 38, 40.\n\u00b2 Fargard, xix.\n\u00b3 \"Yes, may be like those who bring on this world's perfection,\nAs the Ahuras of the Lord bearing gifts with Asha's grace,\nFor there are our thoughts abiding where wisdom dwells in her home.\"\nYasna, xxxi, 9.\nunaging, without disease, deformity, death, or the evil passions; they eat imperishable food, etc.\\footnote{Yasht, xix, 89, and elsewhere.}\n\nA question in ethnology of the utmost moment presses itself upon our attention. No one doubts, as I suppose, that the Indian Aryans, the people who spoke early Sanskrit, once lived with the people who spoke Zend,\\footnote{Centuries earlier. That they were closely connected by ties of kindred with these early emigrants is absolutely certain.} for the Aryans went down into India through territory named in the Avesta, or reported by the Greeks, as being deeply coloured with Zoroastrian associations.\n\nIt is indeed safest to suppose that the people who worshipped God under the old name of Daevas, and who are so prominent in an evil sense in the Avesta, were only the lingering remnant of the tribesmen whose vanguard had already long since gone south.\\footnote{Centuries earlier. That they were closely connected by ties of kindred with these early emigrants is absolutely certain.} If they were, indeed, no more than a last shred of them, yet the conjunction of circumstances is of rare interest. It is seldom that we see two distinguished ancient peoples, later separated by hundreds of miles, in close connection, even if one of them is but a feeble residue; yet it is undoubted, while a possibility comes into view which might be almost regarded as of overpowering moment in such questions. Were these Daeva-worshippers who were so fiercely fought in the G\u0101thas not a forgotten shred of a people, the masses of whom had long previously migrated to India?; but were they actually the vanguard of those masses themselves, whose descendants only afterwards reached the Indus, and became the Aryan Hindoos, so that they were not merely their distant cousins lingering at a later day in the north?\n\nTheir gods were largely the same as those in the Avesta, with the peculiarity that some of the chief ones among them have exchanged their characteristics, being devils in one lore and deities in the other; the languages also in which these details were written were closely cognate. The question arises\u2014were, then, those tribes on the frontier of Iran when the G\u0101thas were first sung, against whom the\nbloody border wars, which are everywhere so apparent in the Avesta, were directed, actually the fathers of the future Indians?\n\nIf they were\u2014and no one can say that they certainly were not\u2014we have in the Avesta documents of such importance for ethnology that it is impossible to exaggerate their value in this connection to attest a profoundly impressive episode in the history of races; and the possibility of the fact must forever hang over the subject.\n\nTo proceed: apart from ethnology itself, we have an actual history in the G\u0101thas. If my venerated friend Prof. Oppert could give as a title to an exposition of one of the columns of the Behistun Inscriptions \"The People and the Language of the Medes,\" how much more appropriately might something like that be the title of the G\u0101thas, with 'Iranians' for 'Medes'? They are as personal as the Psalms, if not, indeed, more so; everything being 'I' and 'Thou,' and the figures of the four chiefs stand out in bold relief. They exhort and pray; now furious at the Daevas-men and anxious over their progress, now in suspense before the encounters, now heart-broken at defeat or jubilant in victory; while all ends in a political marriage fragment of a characteristic description. I can only repeat what I have said before:\u00b9 in the G\u0101thas all is sober and real. Grehma and Bendva, the Karpans, the Kavis, the Usiks are no mythical monsters; no dragon threatens the settlements, and no fabulous beings defend them. Zarathushtra, Jamasp\u0101, Frasho\u0113shtra, Maidy\u014dmah, the Spitamas, the Hvogvas, the Haechataspas are as real as any other characters in history, and they are mentioned with a simplicity which is as unconscious. Except a possible claim to inspiration there are no miracles; all the action is made up of the exertions and passions of living and suffering men. Let the Zendist study the G\u0101thas well, and then let him turn to the Yashts and the Vend\u012bd\u0101d; he will go from the land of reality to the land of fable. He leaves in one a toiling prophet to meet in the other a phantastic demigod.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 See SBE., xxx, Introd., p. xxvi.\nThere are few documents extant which afford indirectly a more genuine portrayal of events. While all annals which make so-called historical assertions are liable to the strongest suspicion (one might almost say that they by their very affirmations make a supposed fact more improbable at once), indications which are both indirect and unconscious are, on the contrary, the sole source of sound conclusions as to the reality of supposed past events.\n\nWe know from the G\u0101thas that a little nation in mid-Asia were impassioned in their religious convictions, and as refined as the Greeks in their modes of religious thought; that they possessed an organization which aimed at the regulation of agricultural and other forms of industrial civil life; that they were of our Aryan blood; that they were closely related to the Indian Aryans; that they struggled through border wars with tribes whom they deemed half pagan; that they ultimately founded a branch at least of the great Medo-Persian nation, and spread their religion over vast territories among millions of inhabitants through successive generations; and the most memorable figure among them bore the name of Zarathushtra.\n\nData in the history of politics are involved in this, and we have in the G\u0101thas, I believe, for the first time in the Aryan world, a union of Church and State. A contribution to the history of logic is involved in what has been already said at the outset. A history of rhetoric, if one existed, would gain a memorable particular. That such a state of mental culture should have prevailed as could make possible such expressions as \"This ask I Thee; aright, Ahura, tell me,\" is truly astonishing when we clearly see that they were used with no slightest approach to a foolish belief that God would either physically hear or vocally answer.\n\n\"This ask I Thee, aright, Ahura, tell me:\nWho ever earth and sky from falling guarded;\nWho hath save Thee brought forth forests and rivers;\nWho with the winds hath yoked storm-clouds to racers;\nWho of the good man's grace ever was source?\"\nThis ask I Thee; aright, Ahura, tell me:\nWho with skilled hand the lights | made, who the darkness;\nWho with wise deed hath giv'n sleep, or our waking;\nWho hath auroras spread, noontides and midnights,\nWarning discerning man, duty's true guides?\"\u00b9\n\nIt might have been written yesterday. It is simply certain\nthat the interrogatives are those of rhetoric, though this seems\nincredible for the period. The uses of such terms as 'son\nof Ahura,' 'daughter of Ahura' were more to be expected.\n\nComing to more technical matter, we have an almost\nequally interesting item in the matter of metre. I fear\nwe hardly realise the very exceptional nature of this\ncircumstance. The metres of the Rig Veda have been sacred\nand studied for (say) at least two thousand years; some of\nthem are mentioned in the Veda itself, but one of the oldest\nand most valued of them was found in the Zend Avesta\nsome forty years ago.\u00b2\n\nZend philology has the reputation of being the most\ndifficult of Oriental subjects in an Aryan tongue, as it\nrequires a serious knowledge of several ancient languages.\nThe Pahlavi in which the ancient native commentaries are\nchiefly written is the most inscrutable of all characters\nwhich have been preserved in manuscripts. The Sanskrit\nof the Yasna translation is also of a peculiar cast, disturbed\nin the sequence of its words by the fact that it is a\nrendering of a rendering, while the Parsi-Persian is as\nirregular as it is indispensable. No man living has ever\nyet sounded these ancient expositions to their depths in\nall parts of their extent, though Spiegel has given us\nenormous help.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 Yasma, xlv, 3 et seq.\n\u00b2 Some of the most precious parts of the G\u0101thas are written in trish\u1e6dup, and\nothers in trish\u1e6dup with the simple addition of a line.\n\u00b3 Since Spiegel's pioneer attempt no second edition of the Pahlavi translation\nof the Yasna has appeared outside of the G\u0101thas. Spiegel did the great\nfoundation work here as from the beginning, but most valuable as his contribution\nwas, having been based upon a single manuscript, it was as of course just in so\nfar limited as a means of permanent assistance, and it is now well-nigh half\na century old. So also his very valuable text and partial rendering of Nery\u014dsang;\nit is now, of course, to some degree antiquated, while the exceedingly precious\nVery few indeed have ever made the shadow of an attempt to explore these regions, and from among the excessively small number of scholars who pretend to be independent experts some of the most prominent have advanced to the highest enterprises of Zend philology with the open statement that they have left these original translations unmastered.\n\nBut lest I should be misunderstood, let me hasten to say that the lore of the Avesta is by no means alone as to this particular.\n\nAs a simple matter of fact, the human family has not been in a position in which it has been able to support a sufficiently large class of persons fitted and willing to grapple with these nearly endless and too often thankless tasks, and the report which those who have sacrificed themselves sometimes bring in is enough to repel many who might otherwise be both competent and ready. But we must not despair. Slowly and little by little the pioneers are clearing the forests, and the miners are extracting the ore; while the very mass of the work still left undone offers an opportunity to enterprising minds, and enough has been discovered to whet the flagging appetite. We need first of all a thoroughly critical edition and explanation of the Asiatic commentaries, and we need translations made only after they have been thoroughly studied.\n\nAnd here I suppose that it is proper for me on this occasion to give some general idea of the plan of my own\n\nParsi-Persian rendering, often the key to the Pahlavi, has not been at all reproduced, except in the Five Zarathushtrian G\u0101thas. Nor does any full and modern explanation of the Pahlavi of the Vendidad exist, while partial translations are often silent when we wish them most to speak; and so of the Parsi-Persian version of the Vendidad. Justi's masterly dictionary, of which Roth could write as the \"musterh\u00e4tt eingereichtes zweckmassiges Handbuch,\" is, of course, now to some degree too old; it was published in 1863, and needs to be supplemented by the labours of scholars who understand all parts of their business. This is only a part of what needs to be done on the texts of the Avesta itself, not to speak of the Pahlavi literature.\n\n1 Who can name more than a very few units?\n2 Writing to others to decipher their texts for them, and, as too often in similar cases, with difficulty forgiving their benefactors for doing them the favour.\n3 Let it be kindly remembered on what occasion this paper was first read.\nwell-meant labours, and of those which I propose for my pupils. Spiegel's bahnbrechend texts, translations, and commentaries were, indeed, a foundation on which any man might be proud to build, though criticised by men who did not know the chief alphabet involved. But my objects were different in kind: Spiegel's work was necessarily spread over an enormous territory; my object was to take a single field and explain every part of it in all its details. So vast had been the lack of labour since Spiegel's main works in this respect, that editors and translators had been, and have been even till to-day, forced to furnish provisional editions and renderings which must forever bear the mark of limited preparation.\n\nI saw, as others did, the astounding gap many years ago. The particular work, as attempted in the only manner in which it ought to have been attempted, had at that date been attempted by nobody living, and nobody was willing to undertake it. It being left wholly unattended to in the manner desired, I set out as an autodact to do what I could toward an exhaustive rendering of the G\u0101thas, with the Asiatic commentaries edited with the collation of all the MSS., and interpreted by that well-nigh endless translation and re-translation which their peculiar circumstances required.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 See the \"Five Zarathushtrian G\u0101thas,\" Introduction, p. xiv et seq. I am far from underrating the very useful suggestions which have been made by the pupils of Roth (for I am of their number). On the contrary, that very great interpreter did an inestimable service (strange to say) in attempting to read the G\u0101thas (at first only) with a practical disregard of the Asiatic commentaries, even being, as he told me more than once, without \"any experience\" of their chief language (later, however, even writing upon it, in Z.D.M.G.; Zend was with him, let it be remembered, only a secondary study). It was an indispensable service for some scholar of supreme authority to read the G\u0101thas as pure Sanskrit (so to speak), giving us all the courage to say that the Pahlavi commentaries are by no means slavishly to be followed, and great is my own personal indebtedness to him. I understood from him that Haug was his pupil also on the Zend; and at the date of Haug's great work on the G\u0101thas he, too, evidently had no knowledge of the Pahlavi language, affording, nevertheless, the most valuable preliminary results; but such provisional and tentative expositions should be followed by others attempted only with a mind prepared by exhausting the materials. (I need hardly remind many of my readers that Haug became later a high authority on Pahlavi, giving us discoveries and hints of inestimable value. Roth also, as I have said, later conceded its importance.)\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nIt was for this reason that Professor Darmesteter so urgently requested me to take his place in writing the then still needed translation of the Yasna (which contains the G\u0101thas) in the thirty-first volume of the \"Sacred Books of the East.\"\n\n1 \"In the hope of a favourable answer.\" The remaining parts of this note are in answer to erroneous statements which are carelessly contradictory to my own printed remarks (see below); these errors have also been given a wide circulation in a publication of an importance of its kind second to none. I gladly take this opportunity to correct them.\n\nIn the preface to the thirty-first volume of the \"Sacred Books of the East,\" p. 5, I had said: \"My work on the G\u0101thas had been for some time in his [Professor Darmesteter's] hands, and he requested me as a friend to write the still needed volume of the translation. Although deeply appreciating the undesirableness of following one whose scholarship is only surpassed by his genius, I found myself unable to refuse.\" Yet there appeared so long afterward as 1895 actually in the Annaire of the University of Paris the extraordinary remark\u2014\"Avec cet oubli de soi (!) qui caract\u00e9rise le vrai m\u00e9rite . . . il ceda \u00e0 M. Mills l'honneur d'achever la publication,\" and distinctively gave the impression in some other words that I suggested (?) the arrangement. The exclamation points are my own. This very singular version of the facts lingers in Paris to contradict me till this day.\n\nThe renderings afterwards published in my G\u0101thas (let me repeat once for all) were in Professor Darmesteter's possession in an unfinished condition, though provisionally printed, and he wrote pointedly asking me to repeat them in the book which he was urging me to write as his continuator: \"Vous n'avez qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9tacher de votre travail [the G\u0101thas] la traduction rythmique avec quelques notes explicatives et le mot-\u00e0-mot [Latin] quand vous en \u00e9cartez trop. Cela vous prendrait infiniment peu de temps, puisque de travail est d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait . . . dans l'espoir d'une r\u00e9ponse favorable.\" (Nov. 5, 1883, some sixteen years ago.) I was also so fortunate as to be of service to other distinguished persons; and a somewhat similar occurrence forced me to allude to it to explain to students of Zend who may be using certain books and may wonder why they do not see my name in them. This time it was gentlemen on the other side of the Rhine whom I was able to help. But, unlike my great colleague, these beneficiaries, to whom I had extended assistance immeasurably greater than acts of decipherment, resorted to the strange policy of total silence, combining together to omit all mention of my name in some books bearing on this subject (a course which is considered among scholars one of the most aggravated forms of indignity which it is possible to devise). Darmesteter could speak in noble terms of thankfulness with Pischel and Justi, and that not in private communications but in leading publications: see the G\u00f6tt. gelehr. Anz. of May 13, 1893; Revue Critique of Sept. 18, 1893; Z.D.M.G., July, 1896; etc., etc.\n\nBut what will an honourable public say of professed old friends, who had received the closest form of personal teaching by long previously advanced copies of an unpublished pioneer work, put often at their own request gratuitously into their hands, and then combining to boycott the scholar who had taught them their rudiments. And this is the explanation of a fact noticed as curious by a very distinguished friend of all Zendists in the London Daily Telegraph of August 10, 1894.\n\nFortunately the circumstance has been as harmless as it was contemptible. My sole offence, I need hardly say, consisted in the original treatment of things hitherto unattempted, and the very strong expressions of recognition which followed them. Though I was warned by Darmesteter of the fate of all pioneers, and though the actual result has been favourable beyond measure, yet one cannot forget the sting of a degraded ingratitude.\nAnd if life be spared I must continue on with precisely this same plan so long since adopted, and produce an exhaustive treatment of the rest of the Avesta. As Professor Pischel was so kind as to say, my procedure (after a work of 650 pages) includes a dictionary.\\(^1\\) A large fraction of this is at this moment in type, and I hope soon to offer the University a first section of it, to be followed by others without interruption, save such as may temporarily take place from the pressure of inevitable duties. Side by side with this effort I hope to progress with a preliminary treatment of the Pahlavi Sanskrit and Persian texts of other parts of the Yasna and Vendidad on the plan mentioned. I should also report that I seem to have secured a serious adhesion in reference to some reforming suggestions as to the decipherment of the Zend alphabet itself as distinguished from that of the Pahlavi. A somewhat full article which appeared in the last (October) Heft of the Zeitschrift of the German Oriental Society engaged the acquiescent sympathy of certain distinguished scholars who saw it in manuscript before its publication, and this I regard as important in view of the new matter suggested.\n\nIf but one-half of what specialists report as to the elements of interest involved in the study of it be in fact the truth, many who have no time to enter into the professional details of this laborious speciality will greatly desire to acquire a general view of it based upon the solid results already attained. For the benefit of such persons let me say what indeed will seem to them somewhat unaccountable: it is that the extraordinary difficulties of the G\u0101thas have reference largely to technical detail. Just that which makes them most difficult to advanced experts, viz., their sparse expression, makes them to a certain degree all the more accessible to one who values them chiefly for\n\n\\(^1\\) Mills' \"Werk, das ergebniss langj\u00e4hriger M\u00fche und entsagungsvoller Arbeit, vereinigt bis auf ein W\u00f6rterbuch das in Aussicht gestellt wird, alles was f\u00fcr die Erkl\u00e4rung der G\u0101thas nothwendig ist . . . .

Incredible as it may appear to a novice, some of the most difficult strophes in the G\u0101thas (that is to say, some of the most difficult to those who exact an absolute certainty as to the precise literary point of the detailed sentences) are made up of words of the simplest description, so that the translation of the actual terms of the greater part of the strophes into the cognate Sanskrit possesses no difficulty at all;\u00b9 and even word-for-word imitations in Latin can often vary from each other only in the choice of synonyms. An acquisition of a knowledge of the consecutive terms is, with the exception of inscrutable forms here and there, by no means a very intricate undertaking, and these literal terms convey what Biblical students most admire, viz., the depth of the moral sentiment and the height of its fervour. We might even leave all the more difficult words untranslated, indicating the spaces which their rendering would occupy by blanks, and very much of great importance would be left; indeed, it would not be too much to say that the most of what we value them for would still be preserved. One reason for this state of things has been already stated: great difficulties may occur on a part of a strophe which bears on ideas of a secondary or qualifying importance (to the general theme). But these differences in opinion as to exegesis are also robbed of their fatal severity by that cause to which I have already alluded, but which I will now state again in a new form, and draw from it a vitally important conclusion. It was this, as expanded (see above on p. 277): one of two, three, or even four slightly or flagrantly differing renderings, as is usual in similar cases, may be the correct one; but, what is seldom indeed the case, not one of the two, three, or four varying views, grossly as they may differ, can possibly avoid expressing what we most value in our researches.\n\nIf the 'good mind' when meaning the 'good man' has that sense only with a full inclusion of all that the good\n\n\u00b9 See Roth's \"Festgr\u00fcss,\" p. 192.\nmind meant in the G\u0101thas (see above)\u2014if Asha never meant the 'church' in them without a solemn reference to the 'law' which the church embodied, etc. (see above on page 277)\u2014why, then, the terminology absolutely shuts out the purely commonplace sense (almost, if not quite, totally) everywhere, and it shuts in the expression of moral and religious depth.\\(^1\\)\n\nI am the first Professor who has taught on Zend philology in Oxford since Thomas Hyde expounded such parts of it as had been then discovered in the year 1700.\\(^2\\) That the subject should have been so long neglected is, indeed, to be regretted; and it is to be hoped that we may pursue it now with vigour.\n\nAs is implied in what I have already said, the first duty of an accredited specialist on such a subject is to contribute toward its completion as a legitimate branch of science, and this can only be done by printed books.\n\nKnowledge which is locked up in a single memory has but a precarious tenure; and becomes also exaggerated in public estimation. It must, moreover, perish with the life of its possessor. Every specialist on such a subject as Zend philology is, or should be, well-nigh overwhelmed with labour, all of which must ultimately come to press. I offer, of course, no exception to this rule, and I cheerfully give the rest of my life under the providence of God to this duty.\n\nI will close by citing the remark of a respected writer in the Critical Review of January, 1896: \"The G\u0101thas, or\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Surely to many of us it is (for instance) of inferior importance whether a sentence means 'finding the way to God' or 'finding His throne'; the 'way' must lead to the 'throne,' and 'the throne' is found by 'the way'; and yet this uncertainty occurs in a passage of the utmost difficulty, where a positive decision is almost impossible.\n\n\\(^2\\) It was in this year that he published his \"Historia Religionis Veterum Persarum.\" He was one of the most distinguished Orientalists of his time (born 1636, came to Oxford 1658, made Reader of Hebrew 1659, Keeper of the Bodleian in the same year, in 1665 was appointed Librarian-in-chief, 1673 Archdeacon of Gloucester, 1691 Laudian Professor of Arabic, 1697 Regius Professor of Hebrew, Eastern interpreter at the Court under Charles II, James II, and William III, died in Oxford 1703).\nHymns, of Zoroaster are by far the most precious relic which we possess of Oriental religion; the only sacred literature which in dignity, profoundness, in purity of thought, and absolute freedom from unworthy conceptions of the divine, could ever for a moment be compared with the Hebrew scriptures.\"\nART. X.\u2014Notes on the Origin of the 'Lunar' and 'Solar' Aryan Tribes, and on the 'R\u0101jput' Clans. By B. H. Baden-Powell, C.I.E., M.R.A.S.\n\nBy way of explanation, I may be permitted to say that having been for some time engaged on an inquiry into the history of the various kinds of Indian landlord tenure,\u00b9 not as a matter of theory, but on the basis of local facts, it became necessary to consider the origin and distribution of the tribes or clans to which the landlord classes most commonly belong. A number of notes were thus accumulated; and I thought it might be useful to put them together, much more in the hope of receiving correction, and of thus gaining information, than with the design of imparting it. It at once appears, as regards Northern India, that of the superior proprietor class when 'Hindu,' or at least originally Hindu, a large proportion belongs to the tribes known as 'R\u0101jput.' Some of the higher families, however, now resent being so designated, and call themselves 'Kshatriya.'\u00b2 The latter name, again, is usually understood to have reference to the military and ruling caste of ancient times,\n\n\u00b9 Which I hope eventually to publish in continuation of my study of the Indian village communities and their tenures.\n\u00b2 Or in the spoken form Chatr\u012b. This, in fact, is the equivalent of 'Kshatriya,' and not the word Khatri, which is also in use but indicates quite another caste. The latter has no real connection with the old military order, though sometimes attempts are made to assert such a connection. The objection to be called 'R\u0101jput' is quite modern, the reason being that 'R\u0101jput' now applies to a large group of caste-men who have become agricultural, and have even taken to cultivating with their own hands (saving only the touch of the plough\u2014not that!). The higher families therefore desire some distinguishing name, and naturally assert that of the twice-born caste of old. Yet when the name R\u0101jput was first used, it certainly was in a laudatory sense, meaning the royal or ruling race.\nand to have been comprised in two great groups known as 'Solar' and 'Lunar' respectively. It was almost inevitable to inquire whether anything could be ascertained about the (probable) real birthplace and connection of the so-called 'R\u0101jput' races. So much is clear, that the names of the various clans and septs are not names which occur in any early literature; and they can but rarely be connected, even by any tradition that will stand the slightest analysis, with the Kshatriya races of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and Pur\u0101\u1e47as. The term 'R\u0101jput' seems rather to have been invented expressly to meet the case of conquering or ruling clans and houses whose origin did not, in general, enable them to be linked with the established 'Solar' or 'Lunar' genealogies.\n\nI am informed that the term 'r\u0101ja-putra' often occurs in Sanskrit literature in the sense of 'prince' or 'king's son,' but is not used as the designation of a caste or tribe before the eleventh century. The question, however, deserves further investigation. The term certainly is much connected with the idea of the \"thirty-six royal houses,\" and the latter seems to have originated with the mediaeval bards. Some of the largest R\u0101jput clans are professedly not connected with the Solar and Lunar races. When such a connection is asserted, it is rarely due to any other cause than to the natural desire of bards and genealogists to find an 'orthodox' origin for their princes whose clan had become famous in the land and whose dignity was acknowledged. In most cases, custom, history, and birthplace are all against such an origin. But here I refer to a connection with the earlier races of the most familiar centre\u2014the Ganges Valley and the old states of Indraprastha, K\u0101\u015b\u012b, and Magadha, or the 'Solar' kingdom of Ayodhya. For there is a more tangible connection, in some cases, with the Aryan stock, in the fact that some R\u0101jputs are derived from, or mixed up with, the great Y\u0101dava tribe or group of tribes. Now since uniform tradition represents Yadu (the ancestor) as a brother of Puru, the progenitor of the 'Lunar' tribes\ntheir common father being Yay\u0101ti), it follows that the Y\u0101davas are, in a sense, 'Lunar.' But it is noteworthy that with Yay\u0101ti (or perhaps with his father, Nahusa) all knowledge of ancestry ceases, and the earlier names in the table are of mythical persons\u2014the moon, the earth, the planet Mercury (Budha), etc. I shall therefore take the liberty of confining the term 'Lunar' to the Ganges Valley group\u2014the reputed descendants of Puru, and better known as the Kuru-Pa\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la families. To make 'Lunar' apply to both, would be to render undistinguishable two totally distinct groups. For, assuming the entry of the Aryan confederate tribes at the north-west corner of India, all literature and tradition point to a wide and early separation between the Y\u0101dava tribes who took the Indus Valley line, and the other tribes who went eastward\u2014crossing the Panjab and gradually occupying the whole of the Ganges plain as far as the sea. These two groups I shall distinguish as the 'Western' and 'Eastern' (or Ganges Valley) Aryans. Once separated, they always remained apart; distinct in dialect and racial character, and, for a long time, in religion. They were separated in the north by the intervening Panjab plains, and in the south by the line of the Narbada and the Vindhyan Hilla. The two groups were only brought in contact in after times (1) by the curious formation and movement (via the Chambal Valley) of the \u015a\u016brasena branch, of whom came Krishna,\\(^1\\) who entered into an alliance with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101va; and (2) by the vague contact of the Haihaya king Sahasra-arjuna with the (Brahman) Bh\u1e5bgu tribe (Par\u0101\u015bur\u0101ma), and, some generations later, of the T\u0101laj\u0101\u1e45gha branch of the same with a king of Ikshw\u0101ku descent. Owing to the peculiarity of the Sun-worshipping or Solar tribes, there is a thread of connection in that line, which, however, does not necessarily attach to the (Brahmanic) Solar group of Oudh. I take the opportunity of noting that I keep the 'Solar' history entirely distinct, putting what has to be said about it in a separate section.\n\n\\(^{1}\\) I permit myself to use the familiar form, for simplicity of printing, instead of the more accurate K\u1e63\u1e47a.\nNotwithstanding that the R\u0101jputs are largely foreign and post-Aryan, it is impossible to deal with their history without considering the general facts about the 'Lunar' and 'Solar' genealogies. In doing this, literary and traditional statements have been taken as they stand, and for what they are worth; their continuity, and even probability, are sometimes attested by coins and inscriptions. It is, of course, open to anyone to attribute them all to fancy, or to explain them allegorically. On the other hand, among a people so retentive of genealogical reminiscences\u2014as far as human or natural progenitors are concerned\u2014it seems to me unlikely that the lists of kings and their forefathers are wholly imaginary. It is quite possible that a genealogy may be genuine up to a certain point, and that where further knowledge failed recourse was had to mythical or supernatural ancestors; the whole is not thereby rendered suspicious.\\(^1\\) Moreover, different genealogies may contain variations, whether by change or addition; but these very variations tend to show that there is a real basis. Whether this is so or not, it is worth while seeing what it is that literary references, traditions, and 'gotr\u0101ch\u0101rya' really do assert or imply.\n\nIt is not beyond the memory of living persons that the generally received opinion regarding the 'Hindu' races represented the Sanskrit-speaking Aryans as forming the chief, if not the only, important element in the population of all ranks throughout India.\\(^2\\) The Aryans, so it was believed, in the course of their general advance into India, met with some barbarous, snub-nosed, black tribes of little importance; these they put to flight, driving them to refuge, either in the outer Himalayan ranges in the north, or to the Vindhyan Hills of the centre, or to places still further south. Aryans then filled the land, as far as it was adapted for immediate occupation. They it was who\n\n\\(^1\\) Moreover, where some mythic story is introduced, impossible to connect with real persons, it is very likely to be an allegorical way of representing some real occurrence, which could not be explained.\n\n\\(^2\\) Excluding, that is, the originally Moslem tribes and those non-Aryans who are conventionally called 'aboriginal.'\nintroduced agriculture, and practised it in 'village communities' by their Vai\u015bya caste, aided by the \u015a\u016bdra or servile, fourth, caste; and the whole country was ruled over by Kshatriya kings, with the help of Brahman councillors. The Brahmanic caste and religion were assumed as everywhere dominant. Little attention was paid to the indications that there were other tribes of importance who appear to have entered India about the same time as the Aryans, or perhaps before them; and that these were not always disposed to yield submission to the Brahmanic yoke. Little attention also was paid to the subsequent irruptions, or to the great changes that must have taken place locally, when successions of \u015a\u0101k\u0101, Ku\u1e63an, Gurjara, and H\u016b\u1e47a tribes came to India. Nor was allowance made for the important influence of some of these tribes, whose language must have already had affinities with the Sanskrit, and to which we owe the P\u0101li element in language and the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi character. These Northern races sooner or later abandoned their original worship of the Sun and the Serpent (or both?) and adopted Jainism, or, still more widely, Buddhism. The great body of Jaina or Buddhist tribes were not converts (or perverts) from orthodox Brahmanism, in whatever stage of development. I am not aware of any evidence of wholesale conversions (I do not say individual cases) of tribes from Brahmanism to Jainism or Buddhism. Rather those separate faiths were adopted by clans who were either far removed from contact with Brahmanical developments, or who never accepted them until long after Epic and Puranic history closes.\n\nIn the absence of such corrective considerations, the Brahmanic stories reported indiscriminately by Tod and others were accepted; and it was taken, as a matter demanding no further inquiry, that the 'R\u0101jputs' were of 'Solar' or 'Lunar' origin, as the case might be; and that, in fact, they continued, unbroken, the line of the old military caste. This general acquiescence in a prominently Aryan, Brahmanic, or 'Sanskrit' origin for everything was, however, not unnatural, seeing that, as a fact, 'Hindu'\ndialects, as well as caste and religious observances, spread widely and coloured the greater part of Indian life to a surprising extent, although the result was reached in a way other than that commonly supposed. And today we are perhaps too much inclined to 'Sanskrutize everything.'\n\nIf we look to the actual extension of Aryan speech, and note the regions where Sanskrit is substantially the basis of popular language, both north of the Narbada and in the west and centre of India, it is evident that Aryan influence must have had its source partly in the actual early settlement of Aryan clans and partly in later changes effected by Brahmanic missionaries. If we imagine a map of India, coloured red where Aryan speech mostly prevails and blue where the Dravidian and Kolarian, etc., were but slightly affected; and if we draw a double line across the continent, following the double line of the Vindhyan ranges, north and south of the Narbada, we observe that the country north of the upper line is red, and most purely so in the Madhyade\u015ba or central region of the Ganges. In the further regions of the south the blue would be almost unchanged, since the Telugu, Tamil, and other local languages have only received additions from the Sanskrit, but the basis of\n\n---\n\n1 In a quite recent authority I have seen it objected that the H\u016bns must be referred, not to the Huns of the fifth century, but to some other 'Kshatriya' race, because they appear in a text of Manu or in the Pur\u0101\u1e47a, etc. But is there sufficient reason to believe that these texts, whether by origin or later recension, are earlier than the first few centuries of our era? So, too, when strange names in Hebrew appear for articles of commerce imported by King Solomon (1000 B.C.) from India, we immediately set about discovering Sanskrit origins for the words. What Sanskrit-speaking people had by that time so prevailed as to have made their speech the common language of commerce on the West Coast of India? What possible Sanskrit name (to take a single example) could there be for 'sandalwood,' when the tree does not grow in or near any country in which a Sanskrit-speaking people had established themselves? Maisur, the home of Santalum album, was not an Aryan country, and only became 'Hinduized' at a late date, when it acquired a Brahmanic dynasty. As a matter of fact we find the old Dravidian name of the product adopted into Sanskrit (as well as into every Indian dialect and even into Burmese) when the wood became an article of commerce throughout India. I do not say that the 'almug' or 'algum' of Scripture can be directly traced to a Dravidian name, as most of the other words can. We must make allowance also for the uncertainty of the kind of wood intended, and for the possibility of a name being transmitted (or substituted) by trading intermediaries from the coast of Arabia or Africa. But certainly there is no Sanskrit original.\nthe language is not Sanskritic. But the upper part of\nthe country below the lower line would be less easily\ndistinguished. A sharp division as to colour would not\nbe possible. The Narbada Valley itself would be chiefly\nred. As to the country beyond it, at the western end an\nextensive and well-marked suffusion of red would cover\nGujarat, the Western Dakhan, and the Upper West Coast;\nat the eastern end, a smaller suffusion would cover (but not\nentirely) Orissa. At the eastern end, too, of the Vindhyan\nhill country there would be some Aryan element, owing\nto intercourse between Baghelkhand and the region of\nMagadha beyond; while in the middle the present much\n'Hinduized' dialect of the Central Provinces is due to later\nevents.\n\nBut it is not enough merely to distinguish areas in which\nthe speech was more or less affected by a dominant Sanskritic\nelement. The subject is one regarding which I have no\npretensions to be able to speak; but so much seems correct\nto say, that within the large area coloured red on our\nimaginary map, the Sanskrit grammarians (I believe not\nbefore the fifth century) distinguish three principal variations\n\u2014which were doubtless intended, each, to include several\nsubordinate varieties. The western area was characterized\nby the Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u012b, the central by the \u015a\u016brasen\u012b, while\nUpper India had an eastern portion distinguished by\nthe Magadh\u012b. This is exclusive of the Southern dialects,\nwhich cannot properly be treated as 'Prakrits,' though\nnaturally they were so imagined by Brahman writers. It\nmay be reasonably supposed that these writers, living\nperhaps near Ujjain or Kanauj or some other orthodox\ncentre, regarded the general Aryanized speech of Central\nUpper India or Madhyadesa, as the standard; so that the\nthree named are the prominent variants from that standard.\nThese authors were perhaps too centrally situated to know\nof the ancient Aryan element in distant K\u0101\u015bm\u012br, or of the\n\n1 See Gazetteer Cent. Prov., Introd., p. cxxvii. It was not till after the\nreign of Akbar that any considerable Hindi-speaking population extended\nbeyond the Narbada districts.\nSindhi with its archaic traces, or of the Sanskritic basis of Panj\u0101b speech. Now the Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dri region (including, I suppose, the minor variants of Ka\u00e7ch, Gujar\u0101t, or Marw\u0101r) does really show a region where special causes for a change can be assigned; and so in the case of the (\u015a\u016braseni) area of the Chambal Valley. The same is true of the Magadha country about Patna and G\u0101y\u0101, and perhaps including the Bhojpuri dialect of part of Bih\u0101r. It is impossible to suppose that these marked variations arose among pure Aryan settlers, merely differentiated by time and locality. It is true the Aryan tribes themselves did differ, as they came to rule over different regions in the course of their separate progress; but the variations are much more due to admixture, not with a few scattered local families, but with numerous and not uncivilized non-Aryan races, either preceding or accompanying them. Largely also they may have been developed by a subsequent addition of foreign races\u2014notably so in the case of Magadha, Central Rajput\u0101na, and Western India.\n\nNow it is curious that both the geographical conditions and the traditional evidence, combine to explain, in each case, what the general cause of the local difference was, even though details may often remain obscure. For example, the \u2018\u015a\u016braseni\u2019 centre: tradition tells us of a branch of the Aryans who came, not at all with the Lunar Aryans to the Ganges plain, but separately, by the western line, to a home in the Narbada Valley. It was a subdivision of this group that extended northwards up the Chambal Valley. As their ultimate centres were at the further part of the valley, with Mathur\u0101 and Bindraban on the Yamun\u0101 for their capitals, they were thus brought into a certain contact with the Eastern Aryans. And as Krishna was born in this family, and was afterwards worshipped (with Mathur\u0101 as a centre of the cult), the whole locale became famous. The development of this cult, its immense popularity, and the connection established between its centre and the western peninsula of Gujar\u0101t, are among the most curious features of Indian history. Then, again, Magadha\nwas notoriously a special or distinct centre, not only because of the early Kolarian races in it, but also because of foreign (Turanian) rulers, the \u015a\u0101sni\u1e45ga and the Maurya, whose capital (P\u0101\u1e6daliputra) was in the region. And we have an even more complete explanation of how Western India came to be differentiated.\n\nAs it is the West that calls for special attention in connection with the R\u0101jput clans, I may just remind readers of the distinctive character of the new Hindu population of the West, with its Mahr\u0101tha chiefs, its superior mercantile caste, and its energetic \u2018Kanbi\u2019 tribes, all-important as regards number and agricultural supremacy. And it is notorious that these people are different both from the people of North India as from those of Madras. This\n\n1 I must not go into details about this curious country; but I may say in a footnote that the earliest (epic) legend places the kingdom in the hands of a tribe who are (in the \u1e5agveda) closely connected with the Bharata, who take as their leader the (Ku\u015bika) Visv\u0101mitra. But before long we find the dynasty of Janakad\u012bn (always belonging to the Lunar genealogy, but in reality indicating some fusion of the Ku\u015bika race with the Lunar Aryans) not only ruling Magadha, with its largely Kolarian population, but extending his power all round, overthrowing the Solar princes to the north-west of his dominion, and threatening Mathur\u0101. Then in the course of time\u2014perhaps owing to a general destruction of Lunar princes in the Great War\u2014we find the Aryan dynasty replaced by one whose designation, \u015a\u0101sni\u1e45ga (or \u015a\u0101sni\u1e45ga), indicates a Turanian, serpent-worshipping, origin, and probably a connection with the Nagbansi houses which, at an undetermined date, established dominion over the Kolarian inhabitants of Churiya N\u0101gpur and Eastern Central Provinces. The advent of these non-Aryan rulers, whether as a new importation or a revival of a power already in India, seems to synchronize with the \u2018prophecy\u2019 of the Vishnu-Pur\u0101\u1e47a that pure Kshatriya kings would cease, and the Yavana, Tu\u1e63\u0101ra, etc., reign in their stead. At the end of the \u015a\u0101sni\u1e45ga times, the Maurya appear, and whether we accept the improbable Buddhist account (Max M\u00fcller, Hist. S. Lit., p. 283 ff.) or the Hindu, the originator was certainly a foreigner. He is found in connection with Taxila in the north; and that, in Alexander\u2019s time, was the capital, if not of the Tak\u1e63a, still of a serpent-worshipping king. It is apparently from Magadha that the foreign Andhra (Gens Andara of Pliny) originate, though they are known chiefly as dominating the northern Telugu country. Being Buddhists, Manu speaks of them with contempt (x, 36), as he does of the L\u014dcchavi (x, 22), though the latter were of great power and dignity (Corp. Ins., iii, 135). Not only was there this strong influx of foreign rulers, but there must have been a large Kolarian (Magh) element in the population. Zimmer mentions that in the Atharvanveda Magadha is alluded to as a \u2018mixed\u2019 race. (Altind. Leh., p. 216; see also p. 35.)\n\n2 Mah\u0101r\u0101stra probably began to receive an Aryan (Y\u0101dava) element almost as soon as the Ganges Valley, if not before it. I cannot readily adopt the derivation of the name from ma\u1e25\u0101 = \u2018magna regio.\u2019 More probable is the origin from Mah\u0101r, the name of a once important Dravidian people whose relics still exist. The country is not mentioned by this name in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (?), but much later in the Mah\u0101v\u0101sso, in connection with the sending of Buddhist\nWestern Aryan influence is traceable southwards as far as the upper part of the North K\u0101nara District. It received a gradual expansion eastward up to and after the seventh century; but it was evidently very ancient in the Upper Western districts\u2014in the Dakhan highland, and along the Narbada Valley as far as the Cedi country to the northeast of the present Central Provinces.\n\nIf we look to the Vedas as our earliest sources of information, we do not expect to find the means of making a complete list of Aryan and allied tribes, or of tracing the order of their movements. But what indications there are, fit in with what is said in the epics and Pur\u0101\u1e47as. The most important point has been alluded to already, viz., that when the tribes\u2014such of them as did not remain in K\u0101\u015bmir, Gandh\u0101ra, etc.\u2014reached the plains, one group, and that a powerful body, occupied the Indus Valley, and (naturally) also the country immediately adjacent on the east (such as the \u015aauv\u012bra land, so often mentioned along with Sindhu); and there is evidence that in remote times they extended as far as the Indus mouths. From such a position the group of tribes, as they multiplied or were joined by cognate (or other) tribes of later date from the Western passes, must have been attracted by the wealth and sea trade of Gujar\u0101t, and have extended in that direction, and thence up the Narbada and Tapti Valleys and over Upper Western India in general. But another group of Aryan tribes and allies extended in the other direction, viz., away from the Indus towards the Jamna and Ganges. The evidence does not show any considerable or permanent early Aryan domination of the central plains of the Panjab. The reason can only be conjectured: it was partly because other tribes were already in possession, and still more because, in the absence\n\nmissions after the third synod, apparently in Asoka's time (Lassen, ii, 246), Var\u0101ha Mihira calls the people by this name. When the Mughals conquered the country (sixteenth and seventeenth centuries) they corrupted or changed the name of the people (Mahr\u0101tha) into Marha\u1e6d\u1e6da, which means 'robber.' Huen Thsang speaks of the country as having a large capital, which perhaps means the seat of the West Chalukya dynasty.\n\n1 North Kanara District Manual, vol. ii, 25.\nof irrigation (in such early times), settlement would not have been invited by the nature of the country, except in the immediate vicinity of the rivers. In any case the bulk of the tribes crossed the Panjab plains, and went eastward to and beyond the Jamna. We are not surprised to find that in after times the people and kings of the Sindh country and the adjoining West and South Panjab, are regarded almost as foreigners (along with the frontier \u0160aka, Yavana, etc.), and intercourse with them was less frequent. But there seems to have been some special determining cause for this continued separation, beyond the mere accidents of tribal movement. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata seems to point to some schism or quarrel; for the Panjab is declared to be impure, and unfit for decent Aryans to live in even for two days; and that, because the people would not obey Brahmanic ordinances, \"na hi brahma\u00e7aryam \u00e7aranti.\" And in the time of P\u0101nini the distinction is also to some extent accentuated; these people, says the grammarian, are without kingly government and religious ordinances. From this we may infer that all the Brahman families of any importance led, or accompanied, the eastward-going tribes; any that remained were regarded as 'degraded,' and would not have shared in the development of religion, law, philosophy, and literature that was destined to take place in the Ganges Valley.\n\n1 Such a fertile region as Jalandhar (Trigarta) might (e.g.) have early been inhabited, either at once or by an early expansion, from the Ganges Valley settlement. I refer only to permanent settlements; the early Aryans, being largely pastoral, may have formed temporary encampments on the banks of the rivers.\n\n2 No doubt in the course of time this idea of impurity would fade away. Adventurous princes seeking new settlements would soon disregard it, and in my case, could have found domains like those of the 'Porus' of Alexander's times, where they were not in contact with impure races. Later on the M. represents the P\u0101\u00f1dava princes as making alliance with the B\u0101hik\u0101, Madra, etc., of the Panjab. Brahmins, too, would be tempted to return in order to extend the sphere of their influence, just as they penetrated into other 'uncivilized' regions. (See Lassen, Ind. Alk., ii. 181; Muir, A.S.T., iii. 482.) The Bombyx Gazetteer (vol. i, p. 18, note) refers to a similar impurity, except in the case of pilgrimages, attaching to the more distant countries of Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, and S\u0101s\u0101stra: (this last addition is very curious, since in the R\u0101m\u0101yana, S\u0101s\u0101stra is an Aryan land). In Ma\u1e47u's time it would seem that the Panjab was reckoned as an 'Aryan country,' since (ii. 19) '\u0100ryavarta' takes in the whole land between the Himalaya and the Vindhy\u0101, as far as the ocean, both east and west.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nI may pause for a moment to remark how the geographical features of the country assisted in keeping separate the two groups, so that their later movement and expansion continued to take them farther and farther apart. For the Panj\u0101b plains being a barrier westward, the Indus Valley group would expand downwards to Western India, as already stated. In that course of movement, the barrier of the Vindhyan Hills would keep them separate from the Ganges Valley Aryans. And let me add that not only did the hill ranges themselves form an obstacle, but the whole belt of country between the Jamna-Ganges on the north and the Narbada\u2014where the first Vindhyan ranges are reached, must have been for a long time something in the nature of a 'neutral ground.' It was only locally and sparsely inhabited: in part it was barren, hilly, and inhospitable; in part it was forest-clad, and inhabited chiefly by 'Ni\u1e63\u0101da.' The earliest indications suggest only the rich plateau of Avanti (near the Narbada Valley) as dominated by Aryan kings; while at the eastern end were the \u00c7edi, perhaps identical with the Vatsya people of the further Madhyade\u015ba above. R\u0101jput\u0101na and Northern Central India were not colonized till long afterwards, when the Y\u0101dava began to be driven from the Indus and Panj\u0101b, and when the general movement began which is noticeable about the sixth and seventh centuries.\n\nBut turning to the Vindhyan barrier itself: had the line (or rather lines) extended right across the continent to the extreme West Coast, not only would the Aryans of the Ganges have been kept (as they were) out of Southern India, but the 'Western' group would have been unable to extend as they did; and the whole course of subsequent historic conquests would have been changed. Neither Y\u0101dava,\\(^1\\) and their allies, nor Greeks, nor Indo-Scythian 'satraps,' nor the Gurjara, nor the Arabs, nor, lastly,\n\n\\(^1\\) I cannot say I believe in the Y\u0101dava approaching Gujar\u0101t, etc., by sea. Why should they? It is not, however, impossible that they sent trading vessels from the Indus mouths to the West Coast. But no other tribes came by sea. As to the formidable nature of the obstacle presented by the Vindhyan Hills, now much modified by road and railway, see my \"Ind. Village Community,\" p. 45.\nMahmud of Ghazni and the later emigrant Kathi tribes, would have reached Ka\u00e7ch, Gujar\u00e2t, and the West, however much attracted by the prospect of desirable possessions. But the barrier does not so continue. At some considerable distance from the mouth of the Narbada the upper line of hills stops short and turns northward. The whole of Gujar\u00e2t from Ka\u00e7ch to the Narbada is thus directly open towards the Indus Valley on the north-west. Nothing but a desert tract intervenes, and that would present but little difficulty to lightly equipped armies and tribal groups of early times\u2014at any rate, during some seasons of the year. Moreover, the desert could in some cases be skirted round. Once in the level country of Eastern Gujar\u00e2t, the West Coast districts were directly accessible; the whole Narbada Valley lay open up to Jabalpur; the lower (parallel) valley of the Tapti opened into Berar (very early known as Vidarbha) and Kanhdes, till the eastern central hills and jungles rendered further progress difficult. Nor would the country of the Mahratha highlands\u2014Ahmadnagar, etc.\u2014be inaccessible; and it would offer many advantageous strongholds.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that this configuration also directed the movement of the earliest Turanian or Dravidian tribes who colonized the South, and who seem to have come through the Western passes (where they left a local trace in the Brahui tribe). These tribes may have been nearly contemporaneous with the Yadava in their movement. Aryan tribes coming by this line would bring in their national and linguistic influence, without coming in contact with the Eastern Aryans; the two might have remained more entirely apart than they actually did but for the Chambal Valley settlement, to which allusion has\n\n---\n\n1 We know as a matter of history how in the eleventh century Mahmud, invading through the Western passes beyond the Indus, crossed the river at U\u00e7ch, skirted round the desert, touching Ajmer and the Abu country, and thence moved directly on the plain towards the north of Gujar\u00e2t and came to Anhilpur, whence he crossed the peninsula to attack Somnath. A similar route must have suggested itself to many other earlier adventurers. Others would, at possible seasons, have crossed the open desert and the 'Ir\u00eepa' or Ruan.\nbeen made. It seems also that before very long the route from Gujar\u0101t to M\u0101lwa, and thence to Ajmer (via Doh\u0101d, Ratlam, and Mandasor), became known and used. Further east there would in time be communication from the country above the Upper Narbada and B\u0101ghelkhand: but the far-Eastern people there met with would be hardly more advanced or Brahmanical than the tribes of the Narbada itself.\n\nWe may now return to the Vedic and Epic notices of tribal movement. In the Rgveda a number of tribes are mentioned by name\u2014some clearly Aryan or confederate, others hostile or alien.\u00b9 The \u2018Aryavarna\u2019 are naturally the central object. Two points directly concern us. One is that not the least notice is taken of any descendants of Ikshw\u0101ku (reputed ancestor of the Solar race) going eastward towards Ayodhya, or joining the Aryan host in the eastward march. Possibly, therefore, such a move may have taken place before the times represented by the Vedic hymns. On the other hand, there is mention of the Ikshw\u0101ku house or family as ruling in the Indus Valley at or near P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101la. This shows an \u2018Indus\u2019 or \u2018western\u2019 location of \u2018Solar\u2019 races, and illustrates the rather curious assignment (in the Vishnu-Pur\u0101\u1e47a) of another Solar locale to Saur\u0101\u1e63tra. The second point is that the \u2018aryavarna\u2019 is principally represented by the \u2018pa\u00f1cak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6daya,\u2019 or five races who are descended from, or named after, Anu, Druhyu, Turva\u015ba, Yadu, and Puru.\u00b2 But four other important tribes, in close relation to them, are named. (1) The Trtsu under the king Divodasa and his son Sud\u0101s are apparently orthodox Aryans, under the guidance of Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha and\n\n\u00b9 It is not necessary for my purpose to take any note of the several names that are doubtful or disputed. The \u2018dasyu\u2019 or enemies are, I suppose, certain tribes in the Northern hills; for the Ni\u1e63\u0101da or Bhil tribes would hardly have been met with so far north of the Jamna forest region (see Zimmer as to the Parnaka, Altind. Leb., p. 38). The Rgveda does not represent a stage of progress beyond the Ganges\u2014I might say the Sutlej-Jamna. But already there were \u2018ahi\u2019 or snake-worshipping tribes, as there were in the Panjab, centuries later, in Alexander\u2019s time.\n\n\u00b2 Zimmer, p. 122, collects the places of this mention: Rg., i, 108. 8; viii, 10. 5, etc.\nspecially helped by Indra.\\footnote{The Trtsu are called the sacrifice-loving 'Kshatriya sons of Sud\u0101s' (Rg., iii, 20, 7). As to their help from Indra and crossing the Jamna, see Zimmer, p. 126.} As enemies of Sud\u0101s, (2) the Matsya people are once mentioned.\\footnote{Rg., vii, 8, 16.} The Trtsu are at one time in conflict with the 'five' and afterwards are opposed by the Bharata, and ultimately cross the Jamna and settle there, apparently near the upper part opposite the Sutlej. They are heard of no more, and are never mentioned in the Epics or Pur\u0101\u1e47as. But the Matsya reappear, closely allied with their neighbours the P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101la in the great war, and are settled on the west bank of the Jamna, somewhere north of the place of the disappearance of the Saraswati, and apparently close to where the Trtsu once were.\\footnote{This appears from the R\u0101m\u0101yana, ii, 71, v. 5, 6 (Lassen). And Zimmer, p. 127, refers to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata for the same. The place assigned in Lassen's map (in vol. ii) is quite opposed to this, and many, many miles too far east. But it is explained that the Matsya (also called Kir\u0101ta) afterwards extended further east to the neighbourhood of the \u010cedi.} The others are (3) the Bharata and (4) Ku\u015bika tribes, mentioned together. The Bharata (called puny, arbhak\u0101sah) are driven back across the Bi\u0101s and Sutlej, apparently to a settlement further east.\\footnote{Rg., iii, 33; but it is desirable that this should be cleared up.} There is no further mention of them in the Rgveda; but they appear as an exceedingly numerous people in Epic times, and were certainly settled in the country east of the Jamna. Further remark about them is, however, made under the head of the 'Solar' tribes. The Aryans frequently quarrel among themselves, as ever afterwards. But the whole of the allusions point to the tribes being not alone, or merely meeting with locally settled enemies who are overthrown; they are accompanied or surrounded by other tribes, many of them not Aryan; this general remark is true whatever difference of opinion may exist as to whether this or that tribe named is or is not meant to be 'Aryan.'\n\nAs regards the 'five tribes' themselves, Puru is supposed by Zimmer to have come from an earlier settlement on the\nIndus. Anu may be intended to appear as first settled on the banks of the Paru\u1e63\u1e47i or R\u0101vi. Nothing is said about Druhyu or Turva\u015ba; but Yadu and Turva\u015ba are mentioned together, and this may suggest a remoter, north-western or western home, in union, of their tribes. Druhyu and Anu are also mentioned together; and both names are afterwards (in the Epics) associated with the 'derelict' tribes in the Panjab and those beyond Peshawar. Turva\u015ba is mentioned also with \u015ar\u1e45jaya; this name afterwards appears in the Epic genealogy as that of one of the five Pa\u00f1c\u0101la brothers. And when the 'five tribes' are opposed by the Trtsu, they are aided by a people with a name in dual form\u2014the Vaikar\u1e47a. Zimmer has given good reason for concluding that this name represents the Kuru-K\u1e5bvi people who are afterwards so prominent east of the Jamna. The Veda suggests no blood affinity between the 'five' and these Kuru-Pa\u1e45c\u0101la; it remains for the Epics and Pur\u0101\u1e47as to assert it.\n\nThe Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata of course represents, in general, a much later stage of settlement and a greatly extended geographical knowledge. The real theatre of action is the country of the Eastern Aryans, though the Y\u0101dava and their offshoots,\n\n1 The 'Saraswati' is so interpreted: Rg., vii, 96. 2.\n2 Rg., viii, 74. 15.\n3 Zimmer, p. 124.\n4 The name Kuru does not occur in the Veda, but there are references to the Kauravya people: the K\u1e5bvi are actually named; and we learn from the S\u0101tvatsya Br. that K\u1e5bvi was the ancient name of the Pa\u1e45c\u0101la people.\n5 It is not of much use to enumerate the tribes and countries noticed, because it is so uncertain what is the date of each portion of the poem\u2014whether any mention is in the original or of later interpolation. Taking the text as we have it, we find that the Panjab and Sindh tribes are regarded rather as foreigners, though sons of the Aryan Yadu, Anu, etc. The Aryan home is the Madhya-de\u015ba. The Upper Doab (on both sides of the Jamna) has become the site of the kingdoms of Indraprastha and Hastinapura. The Southern Doab is Pa\u1e45c\u0101la. Benares (K\u0101\u015b\u012b) and the Matya country are long settled. So is the Chambal (Carmanvati) region, and part at least of what was afterwards called M\u0101lwa. The Narbada Valley is occupied. East of that is the Cedi country and Mah\u0101-kosala (Raipur and the Chattisgarh plain), also Berar (Vidarbha), and perhaps K\u0101nd\u0113\u015b. So is the Tapti Valley, the Upper Dakhan (Dakshinapatha), and Saur\u0101stra. Little notice is taken of Ayodhya or Kosala; vague reference is made to the Southern as also to the Eastern and North-Eastern Kingdoms, and even to Sinhala or Ceylon. The serpent-worshipping tribes are in full possession, and make the subject of many legends. The Aryans have gained ground quite as much by marriages and alliances as by force of arms.\nHaihaya, T\u0101laj\u0101\u1e45gha, \u015a\u016brasena, and also Bhoja, as well as the Magadha kings, are all spoken of. Puru now appears as chief, although younger than Yadu; for he acquires the place of honour as \"having given his youth to restore his father (Yay\u0101ti's) strength.\" The other sons fall into the background: Anu, Druhyu, and Turva\u015ba are all connected with the more distant kingdoms, with which the poet has little concern. Anu is the father of the abandoned Panj\u0101b tribes\u2014Madra, B\u0101hika, etc., also called Ar\u0101\u1e6da, and settled near the Y\u0101dava of the Indus region. Turva\u015ba is generally represented as the progenitor of the Yavana, a term used for the 'Greeks'\u2014when they were in evidence\u2014but more generally applied to a group of cognate tribes on the west and north-west frontiers of India. He is also the father of the Ang\u0101, generally placed in N.E. Bengal at the other end of Upper India; this is curious because of a thread of connection often appearing between foreign ruling clans in Magadha, and the North-West frontier. Naturally, perhaps, the sound of 'Anga' makes some authors refer to 'Anu.' Druhyu is sometimes the ancestor of the (N.W.) Gandh\u0101ra people, and sometimes of the Bhoja. This variation reflects the uncertainty which hangs over the much-wandering Bhoja, who, apparently of Y\u0101dava connection, may very well belong to an earlier home in the North-West. The fact is quite clear, that all these remoter kingdoms on the North, North-West, East, and North-East, are regarded as rather out of the pale; and authors are in some doubt about their exact origin.\n\n1 As to Anu's connection with Anari\u1e6da, part of Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, there is a difference. The V.P. associates it and the city Kusasthali with a son of one of Ikhw\u0101ku's brothers, from whom came Revata, whose daughter married Balarama, brother of Krishna (Wilson, p. 354). But Trna, a descendant of Anu, gives rise to the (historic) Yaudheya tribe of the Lower Sutlej Valley, who were attacked by Rudrad\u0101man, the 'Western Satrap,' about 150 A.D. In R.'s inscription (at Girm\u0101r) they are placed along with the Panj\u0101b M\u0101lava (Malii) and Madra (J.R.A.S., 1897, p. 885 ff.). The M. represents Yudhisthira as having a son called Yaudheya by a daughter of the king of the Sibi (Lissner, l. 792).\n\n2 This is stated, in so many words, in the V.P. (Wilson, pp. 175 and 177), which first mentions 'Yavana,' and a little further explains that the term includes the Sindhu, Sauv\u012bra, H\u016bpa, S\u0101lva people, those of S\u0101kala, Madra, Ambasth\u0101, etc.\nThe more purely 'Aryan' settlers of Upper India are all derived from a common ancestor, Puru, who has (as I have said) gained pre-eminence over his brethren. But the secondary progenitor, Kuru, soon becomes more prominent; and the designation 'Paurava,' if used at all, is only retained by one branch. The whole Aryavarta up to Bihar and Magadha is marked by the territories of these tribes. But, as I have observed, they are by no means the sole occupiers, or even dominators, of the entire area. I cannot discover who are intended to be the special settlers of that sacred portion of soil between the Saraswati and the Dr\u0101v\u0101t\u012b, west of the Jamna.\u00b9 But west of the Jamna are placed the Matsya; they are not called blood relations of the five brothers of Pa\u00f1c\u0101la, nor are they of the Kurus, but they are their close allies; and the kingdoms of Hastinapura and Indraprastha (connected with P\u0101ndu) adjoin their territory. Beyond, comes a kingdom at Pratisth\u0101na (Pray\u0101g, near All\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d) and K\u0101\u015bi or Varanasi, east of which is the domain of Mithila or Videha, of Magadha, and (to the north-west) Kosala; none of these latter belong to the 'Lunar' chiefs, though Magadha comes under their sway in the course of time.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the Epic and Puranic record does not point, as we might expect, to the settlements at Hastinapura, Indraprastha, or any place on the west side of the Jamna (e.g. about Thanesvar), as the earliest established cities. The earliest capitals are not founded at or near the first-reached frontier of Eastern settlement. We are to understand that in some way, the great ancestors established themselves in the heart of the country, Puru himself (e.g.) becoming king of Pratisth\u0101na or Pray\u0101g; the city and kingdom of K\u0101\u015bi (or Benares) are understood to be founded contemporaneously with Puru himself; though some authorities make this line of kings only collateral to Puru, being descendants of Puru's uncle (brother of Yuy\u0101ti). Moreover, 'Bharata' becomes king of 'Antarveda.'\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Manu, ii, 19.\nbefore even Hastinapura is founded. This looks as if the country nearer the frontier was in the occupation of other tribes, and that the Matsya-Kuru-Pa\u00f1c\u0101la only slowly and gradually made their way. The Pa\u00f1c\u0101la afterwards build Ahi\u00e7hatra, M\u0101kandi, and Kampilya, and the Matsya build Vrikasthala and Upapl\u0101vya (which I cannot trace). It has also to be borne in mind that even the complete series of kingdoms never covered the entire area of the country. We cannot look on ancient Madhyadesa as we do now at the N.W. Provinces, where we pass the boundary of one district or division only to enter upon the next, in an unbroken series. The early kingdoms were often separated by great stretches of waste land and dense forest.\n\nWith regard to the intervening settlements held by other tribes, we must understand the allusions in the M. to mean that the Matsya-Kuru-Pa\u00f1c\u0101la had to contend with serpent races\u2014the \u2018N\u0101gas,\u2019 who were born of the mythic Kasyapa and his serpent wife Kadru, and who were named V\u0101suki, \u015ae\u015ba, Takshaka, Karkotaka, etc. When the Kuru need to build another city besides Hastinapura, and proceed to clear a site (by burning the forest) for Indraprastha, the \u2018snakes\u2019 are driven away with great slaughter. Their king Takshaka escapes at the time; and afterwards more friendly relations exist, since Arjuna twice marries daughters of the race\u2014one, by the way, connected with the ancient State of Manipura (N.E. Central Provinces). Hostility is, however, easily renewed; and in the time of Arjuna\u2019s grandson Parikshita, the king insults a hermit, who calls on the \u2018snake king\u2019 to avenge him, and the Hindu king is slain (bitten). Janmejaya, his son, in retaliation, undertakes a great \u2018sacrifice\u2019 to destroy the N\u0101ga, and myriads perish; but V\u0101suki, who (curiously enough) is the nephew of a Brahman, intercedes, and further destruction is averted. Fergusson thinks that the appearance of a \u2018N\u0101ga\u2019 dynasty at Magadha (after the Ku\u015bika-Lunar) is merely a resuscitation of Turanian clans already in the country. But it may be connected with a fresh invasion about the sixth century B.C.\nI have no suggestion to offer regarding the general introduction and spread of these serpent-worshipping tribes, whether before the Aryans or simultaneously with them; or whether their known site (Tak\u0101 tribe) in the N.W. Panj\u0101b, and their dominion in K\u0101\u015bmir, gave off branches which extended southward and eastward. It is quite possible that one group of Dravidians took the Indus line and went directly south, while another group kept to the north; so the \u2018N\u0101g\u0101\u2019 in the Eastern Central Provinces, Chutiya N\u0101gpur, etc., may either have been wanderers upcards from the southern continent, or have travelled downards from the north-west frontier across to Magadha and the country at the eastern end of the Vindhyas. I have already expressed a belief that the great bulk of the southern and peninsular Dravidians came by land (and partly perhaps in trading vessels by sea), by the Western route and the Western passes, where the Brah\u016bi still preserve a relic of the ancient language. That need not prevent the supposition that another, smaller group (or some other section) entered further north.\n\nBut to return to the Aryans and their associates in Upper India. The Matsya-Kuru-Pa\u1e47\u00e7\u0101la are by no means the only kingdoms besides Pray\u0101g and K\u0101\u015bi, not forgetting the \u2018Solar\u2019 dominions in Oudh and the country east of it. We must find room for the great Bharata tribe, who, indeed, gave their name to the whole land\u2014\u2018Bh\u0101ratavarsa.\u2019 Bharata is made to be king of \u2018Antarveda,\u2019 which appears to apply to the whole Do\u0101b, though more properly to the south part of it. Then, again, the Bharata are in close connection with the Ku\u015bika (or Kau\u015bika), of whom came Visw\u0101mitra, son of G\u0101dhi, the sage, who led the Bharata.\u00b9 G\u0101dhi founds Kanauj on the Ganges;\u00b2 Kausambhi and Magadha are also Ku\u015bika foundations. Jar\u0101sandha, afterwards king of Magadha, is represented as a \u2018Lunar\u2019 prince; and the\n\n\u00b9 In chap. vii Manu calls Viswamitra the son of G\u0101dhi, a Kau\u015bika. He attained the Brahmanhood by his great humility.\n\u00b2 And one of the names of G\u0101dhipur or Kanyakubja was Ku\u015basthala (Lasseu, i, 158, note 3).\nPur\u0101\u1e47as place him fifteenth in descent from Kuru; but there is a curious story about his miraculous birth (in halves) which perhaps suggests some union of the Ku\u015bika and Lunar tribes. All the authorities, however, call Jar\u0101sandha the son of Vrihadratha.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe various 'cities' appear to have changed their masters before long; since the Kuru and P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101la became enemies, and so, indeed, do many other reigning houses. Thus at the beginning of the great war we find the P\u0101ndava princes claiming cities that had been founded by the P\u0101\u00f1c\u0101la and Matsya,\\(^2\\) or by even earlier hands, since Ku\u015basthala (Kanauj) and V\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101vata (south of Hastinapura) were also claimed by them. But whatever changes took place, we see how, all over the Madhyade\u015ba, other tribes besides Lunar Aryans established their cities.\n\nAt this point it will be convenient to reproduce in two short Tables (I and II) the chief personages of importance to the descent. According to usage, the single name often represents the king of a state with its capital city; and usually there is a whole clan or tribe derived from the king-ancestor. I have not put in the sons of Anu, Druhyu, and Turva\u015ba, as they have been sufficiently alluded to already.\n\nA glance at the two lists shows, first, that the 'Solar' house from Ikshw\u0101ku has no kind of (human) ancestral connection with either the Lunar or the Y\u0101dava line. The M. accordingly hardly takes notice of Ayodhya or Kosala at all. Videha or Mithila is mentioned.\\(^3\\) Next we find the two houses of Puru and Yadu are really completely distinct, only joining at last in the distant common ancestor Yay\u0101ti. But what is of most importance is, that while the whole of the names in Table I are connected with Upper India, and imply an absorption of the kingdoms or domains of the Bharata and Ku\u015bika into the 'Eastern' Aryan group, the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Wilson, V.P., 455, 456, and note. The R\u0101mayana calls him a Ku\u015bika outright.

Thus I infer that the \u00c7edi, who from their position may have become earlier influenced by Brahmanism, really came not from the 'Eastern' group but from the Indus line via the Narbada Valley; and that the Bih\u0101r Bhoja extended in a similar direction.\u00b9\n\n**Table I.**\n\nPURU (son of Yay\u0101ti)\n\nBharata, marries a daughter of the King of Kasi (generations before Hastinapura is founded)\n\nHasti (founder of Hastinapura)\n\nAjnida (and other sons)\n\nSanta\n\nRiksha\n\nKURU (4th progenitor of Ku\u015bika-Kaus\u0101mba, Gadh\u012b, etc.)\n\nBajaswa\n\n[The five brothers of Pa\u00f1c\u0101la land.

The dotted lines indicate that several (or many) intermediate names are omitted. The different genealogies in the \u0100di (Sambhava) Parva of the M., as given in Mr. Hewitt's paper (Appendix A), J.R.A.S. for 1889, pp. 316, 317, do not really present, as far as I can see, any point that affects the result as to the general relationship or tribal connection intended. Particular names differ, are put in or left out, and their order of sequence is not the same. All the genealogies insert Bharata.\n\n\u00b9 The V.P. further illustrates this distribution when it describes the 'regions' of India, and says of Upper India that on the west side of it dwell the Yavana (see note 2, p. 311), on the east side are the Kir\u0101ta, and in the middle \"the four castes\" (explained to mean the Kuru-Pa\u00f1c\u0101la; see Wil-son, pp. 175-7). For the rest of India, the author mentions the regions of M\u0101lwa, Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, etc., as in the west; and the south includes the Pa\u1e47\u1e0dya, Kalinga, etc.\nTable II.\n\nYADU (son of Yay\u0101ti)\n\n- Kro\u1e63\u1e6dri\n- K\u1e63aiika\n- \u0106edi, etc.\n- Satvata\n\nSaty\u0101k\u012b or Yuyudhana\n\nAndhaka\n\nMah\u0101bhoga\n\nBhoja kings of West Bih\u0101r\n\nKukkura, etc.\n\nS\u016bra\n\nVasudeva\n\nKrishna, Balar\u0101ma, and Nanda\n\nFifth son\n\nHAIHAYA\n\nSahasra-arjuna\n\nT\u0101lajangha\n\nS\u016brasena, etc.\n\nNote.\u2014Other genealogies make S\u016bra and S\u016brasena both descendants of Sahasra-arjuna. Krishna is certainly commonly treated as closely connected with the S\u016brasena branch. For the sake of comparison with Table III (further on), which gives the (Brahmanic) \u2018Solar\u2019 houses, it may be mentioned that when Sahasra-arjuna is slain by the (Bh\u1e5bgu Brahman) Para\u015bur\u0101ma, Harischandra, son of Trisankhu (Solar) is reigning (Skanda-P.). Eight descents later (32nd in the whole list) we have Sagara in conflict with the T\u0101lajanghas.\n\nLet me develop a little further the evidence of this separate distribution and local domination of the characteristically different, but linguistically allied, \u2018Eastern\u2019 and \u2018Western\u2019 Aryan groups. There is a complete unanimity as to the Y\u0101dava (with many branches) dominating first the Indus Valley and then the Gujar\u0101t peninsula, Western India, and the Narbada country. The Indus Valley settlements would naturally overflow somewhat on the Panj\u0101b side also. And this overflow was afterwards increased by some early event\u2014possibly indicated by the story of the scattering of the Krishna branch by the Mauryan emperor, which drove some of the Y\u0101dava into the Salt Range or North-West Panj\u0101b. Marks of this residence still survive. Again, say\n\n1 See Arch. Rep. N. India, vol. ii, p. 16.\nabout 120 B.C., in consequence of the Indo-Scythian movement, some of the West and North-West Panj\u0101b tribes, as well as those of the Indus, were displaced; we see that these were Y\u0101dava\u2014the Jhareja and the Bhatti (or Bh\u0101ti) branches of the stock\u2014who were driven to Ka\u00e7ch and Gujar\u0101t, and to \u2018Bhatti\u0101na,\u2019 Jaisalmer, and the \u2018Y\u0101duva\u1e6di\u2019 country east of it (where the J\u0101du\u00f1 State of Rasauli still survives).\u00b9\n\nThe \u015aurasena settlement, by the time it had (at Mathur\u0101 and Bindraban) come into nearer contact with the \u2018Eastern\u2019 group, seems at once to have been subjected to attack. We hear of Jar\u0101sandha from Magadha driving the tribe away. Again, they succumb to the Mauryan king. Once more, to quote Cunningham, \u201cthey were overwhelmed by the Indo-Scythians under the [Northern] Satrap Rajubul and his son Saud\u0101sa. They next fall under the power of the Gupta. At the time of Hwen Thsang\u2019s visit in 635 A.D. the King of Mathur\u0101 was a \u015a\u016bdra, but a few centuries later the \u2018J\u0101du R\u0101jputs\u2019 are in full possession both of Bay\u0101na and Mathur\u0101. Nearly the whole of Eastern R\u0101jputana belonged to the Y\u0101duva\u1e47si.\u201d\u00b2\n\nHow the Krishna branch of the Y\u0101dava became connected with the Gujar\u0101t peninsula is not so clear. But it must be remembered that early Aryan (or semi-Aryan) tribes would naturally have extended to North-Western Gujar\u0101t\u2014most of them probably of Y\u0101dava connection\u2014long before the move towards Mathur\u0101. And when once the Krishna family became celebrated, Y\u0101dava families of any branch, or mere connections (like the later R\u0101vs of Jun\u0101ga\u1e0dh), would hasten to discover their descent from Krishna himself. Naturally we have no direct evidence of specific Y\u0101dava tribes in the\n\n\u00b9 This secondary movement towards the old S\u016brasena region was very likely directed by the traditions of the tribes (see Beames\u2019 Elliot, Gloss., i, 128); but the author did not notice that the occupation of the Y\u0101duva\u1e6di was the consequence of the S\u0101k\u0101 movements, and long centuries after the original S\u016brasena settlement (cf. Arch. Rep., ii, 21, 22). It was in connection with this invasion that (the Y\u0101dava) S\u0101liv\u0101hana, from his Dakhan home, made a brave but ultimately unsuccessful stand against the Indo-Scythians, defeating them at Kahror, sixty miles from Mult\u0101n.\n\n\u00b2 Arch. Rep., vol. xx, p. 1 ff.\nfirst ages; we have only the fact of Y\u0101davas in the Indus region and the certainty that this group extended southwards. Whatever the truth may be, legend soon connects Mathur\u0101 with \u2018Dw\u0101rka\u2019; and as soon as the \u015a\u016brasena are disturbed at Mathur\u0101, we find the Krishna clan backwards and forwards, to and from the peninsula; and Balar\u0101ma marries the daughter of Revata, a local king. In Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra we find Akriti, brother of Bh\u012b\u1e63mak\u0101, king of a local Bhoja territory.\u00b9 Bh\u012b\u1e63mak\u0101 himself is called a Bhoja and is king of Vidarbha, and is the father of Krishna\u2019s wife, Rukmin\u012b. Kro\u1e63\u1e6dri, the son of Yadu, is also king of Vidarbha, and so are his many descendants.\u00b2 The \u015aatvata branch (of Y\u0101dava) are also early kings of \u2018the South.\u2019\u00b3 In later times we find the ancient R\u0101\u1e63trak\u016b\u1e6da (in this very branch) dominant in the Dakhan, and shall notice their career later on; meanwhile it may be said that reasonable evidence can be adduced linking on the R\u0101\u1e63trak\u016b\u1e6da with the later Y\u0101dava dynasty of Devagiri, and the \u2018Hoysala\u2019 Y\u0101davas as far south as Mysore. There are Ku\u1e47bi divisions also, claiming Y\u0101dava origin.\n\nOf the collateral branches (Table II) we have limited and scattered information. These tribes, who long remained non-Brahmanic, were perhaps hardly worthy of much notice from Brahmanic writers. But all are found in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe Bhoja tribes are said to have had eighteen divisions, a specific number frequently used, but meaning nothing more than that the tribe was numerous and much subdivided. Something has already been said as to their locale and their Y\u0101dava connection.\u2074 One branch (that of West Bih\u0101r) is\n\n\u00b9 See Lassen, i, 758. When Arjuna visits Ku\u015basthali (Dw\u0101rka), families of V\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e0da (Krishna\u2019s Y\u0101davas), Andhaka (another Y\u0101dava), and Bhoja families come out to greet him.\n\n\u00b2 The V.P. (Wilson, p. 441) remarks on the great number of the Y\u0101dava branches.\n\n\u00b3 See Aitareya Br., viii, 3. 3\u201314.\n\n\u2074 See Rajendral\u0101la, \u201cAryans in India,\u201d ii, 387. Wilson (V.P., p. 186, note) also concluded that the Bhoja were derived from [perhaps \u2018related to\u2019 would be better] the Y\u0101dava. Bhojakata, one of their cities on the Lower Narbada, was founded by Rukmi, Krishna\u2019s wife\u2019s brother, and Bh\u012b\u1e63mak\u0101 is called a Bhoja. The uncertainty of origin is reflected in the variations of the genealogists. The M. derives Bhoja (in the remote past) from Druhyu. Others take them, more\nshown as directly connected by descent from Yadu through Andhaka. They seem to have been in conflict with the Haihaya in the Lower Narbada Valley. They are mostly connected with the Narbada region and with M\u0101lwa; and the recurrence of the name Bhoj among the 'Pram\u0101ra' kings of M\u0101lwa suggests that possibly the Pram\u0101ra R\u0101jputs may be remote descendants, though in a very mixed race.\n\nThe Haihaya are a distinct branch of the Y\u0101dava, with a separate history. The tribe is certainly ancient, and the Narbada Valley\u2014first in the lower, afterwards in the upper part\u2014is the scene of their settlement; it is a sufficiently distinct territory to place the tribe considerably apart from their other 'Western' relatives, and make them quite outer strangers to the 'Eastern' Aryans of Upper India. I am at a loss to account for the legend which brings the Bh\u1e5bgu-descended (i.e. Brahman) Para\u015bur\u0101ma on to the scene in the Narbada Valley, even if the upper end, nearer Bundelkhand and Mah\u0101kosal\u0101, is intended. But the story of the destruction of Sahasra-arjuna (K\u0101rtav\u012brya) is explicit.\u00b9\n\nThe Haihaya have relations, the T\u0101lja\u1e45gha, who also fight the Solar kings several generations after the time of Para\u015bur\u0101ma and K\u0101rtav\u012brya, judging by the respective places in the list of Trisankhu and Sagara. I do not know\n\n\u00b9 Sahasra-arjuna is represented as deriding the Brahmans, \"clad in skins,\" because \"they thought so much of themselves\" (Muir, A.S.T., i, 462). From early times we begin to have mention of hermits from the North in the Vindhy\u0101n forests; a settlement in the Payo\u1e47\u012b (Tapti) Valley is also mentioned. Possibly the 'heathen' Haihaya mocked the Brahmans, who by their own clansmen or some local adherents avenged themselves. Para\u015bur\u0101ma is made contemporary with R\u0101ma of Oudh by the V.P., which represents the latter as 'humbling' the former! Para\u015bur\u0101ma again appears as miraculously reclaiming the M\u0101labar coast out of the sea; but this latter is a quite late legend to glorify the local Namb\u016bri Brahmans. But possibly it is intended that we should take Para\u015bur\u0101ma as one of those sages who, like Vasistha and Visw\u0101mitra, live through whole ages and appear when wanted: he represents a principle, or symbolizes the fact that now and again the priest merges into the warrior or fights his own battles. Even Brahman kings (in K\u0101bul and Sindh) were not unknown to history, at least in the early centuries of our era.\nto what event the driving of the Haihaya to the farther extremity of the Valley is to be referred; or whether we have evidence to establish the Bhoja in their place in the Lower Valley. But the Haihaya rule in the Upper Valley\u00b9 and in the North-East Central Provinces is historic. It is curious that the Haihaya are often connected with the \u00c7edi people, of whom a single mention occurs in the Rgveda;\u00b2 and the 'Vatsya' tribe appears to have been settled in the same general region, up to the west frontier of Magadha. Indeed, Lassen notes\u00b3 that the \"city of the H.\" is called \"city of the Vatsya,\" and the country 'Vatsabhumi,' in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The \u00c7edi also, if they are not identical with the Vatsya, boast in their inscriptions of descent from the (Haihaya) K\u0101rtav\u012brya.\u2074 The K\u0101lachuri (or Ka\u1e6dchuri) are of this group also, and they (with the Traik\u016btaka clan) are at one time dominant in the West. When the clan was defeated by the early \u010c\u0101lukya king Mangal\u012bsa in the late sixth century they were ruling from Tripura (Tewar), near Jabalpur. The Haihaya were at one time Buddhists, and are afterwards mixed up with the N\u0101gb\u0101nsi chiefs. As they were so much out of the notice of the Brahmanic authors, they seem to have been regarded very much on the same footing as the N\u0101gb\u0101nsi and other foreigners.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 The ancient (lower) capital was Mahismati (Mahesar in the Indore State). Some confusion is caused by the attempt to carry the reminiscence of this traditional seat further up the Valley to Magdla: there is no reason to believe that Garha Mandla, or any other place there, was ever called Mahismati.\n\n\u00b2 Rg., viii, 5, 37.\n\n\u00b3 Vol. I, 744, note.\n\n\u2074 See Arch. Rep., ix, 77. It will be observed that the genealogies (Table II) make them Y\u0101dava, but in another branch. In a later volume (Arch. Rep., xvii, 71) Cunningham says that the \u00c7edi in the oldest R\u0101jim inscription (Raipur District, Central Provinces) do not refer to H., but call themselves sons of Kur\u016b. This may have some special justification, but certainly, in general, the Haihaya are alluded to as '\u00c7edi sw\u0101mi'=lords of the \u00c7edi; and the Kalachuri always accounted themselves Haihaya (see Arch. Rep., ix, p. 92, and Corp. Ins., iii, Intro., p. 10). The Gujar\u0101t bards sometimes insert the Kalachuri (in some corrupt forms) among the \"thirty-six royal clans.\" They were of high rank, and married into families of Mew\u0101r, and the Malwa Pram\u0101ra, in the twelfth century.\n\n\u2075 I can only just allude to the illustration afforded by Sleeman's account of the 'Gond princes' (not that the princes were Gond, but that they ruled over Gondw\u0101na, and left many illegitimate descendants called R\u0101j Gond). The tradition originates the dynasty in one 'Y\u0101dava-r\u0101ya' (the names suggest a Y\u0101dava tribal connection) who was serving a Haihob\u0101nsi chief. He transferred his services to a local N\u0101gb\u0101nsi prince, married the prince's daughter (and\nOf the \u015a\u016brasena (or \u015a\u016brasenaka), whose history is made important by the Krishna legend, something has already been said. There is some confusion about the descent. Krishna is usually associated with the \u015a\u016brasena, but the genealogy derives him from \u015a\u016bra in a collateral branch. Perhaps there was a double connection. But the families are not always friendly; Krishna and the \u015a\u016brasena take opposite sides in the great war. In any case with Mathur\u0101, the centre of a very Brahmanic worship, the \u015a\u016brasena\u2014called 'bhadrak\u0101ra'\u2014the righteous (Brahmanic) law-keepers, must have been separated from the Haihaya.\n\nIt was natural to examine the list of kings and tribes that are represented as taking part in the great war. We should expect to find the array exaggerated by bringing on to the scene distant kings, who could have had nothing really to do with it; but still we might come upon certain indications of affinity. There is, however, little information which throws light on our subject. We only notice that the \u015a\u016brasena (as I have said) are not on the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du side with Krishna. Some of the kings are attached merely (like the King of K\u0101\u015b\u012b) on the ground of family ties. The Bhoja and other Narbada peoples are much divided; some appear on one side and some on the other. The Haihaya are not named, perhaps are meant to be indicated under 'King Dri\u1e63\u1e6daketu of \u00c7edi.'\n\nonly child), and succeeded to the kingdom. This, Sleeman says, was in 'Samvat' 415 (presumably Cedi era) or late in the seventh century (Sleeman makes it Vikram: which is not admissible).\n\nWhile speaking of the Y\u0101dava and cognate tribes, it is impossible to omit all mention of the Ahir, apparently the same as the Abhira, who are certainly a non-Aryan, perhaps early Indo-Seythian tribe, from the north-west. Now, they hold no place in the Panjab, but in the N.W.P. in Ahirw\u0101r\u0101 and the Upper West of India. They are not now esteemed, but once furnished princes both in Nepal and on the West Coast. One list at least, gives 'Abhira,' a place in the 'thirty-six royal clans.' (See J.R.A.S., October, 1897, p. 890, and Arch. Rep., ii, 300.) In the N.W.P. the Ahir are still divided into great, and quite independent, sections\u2014Jadubansi, Nandabansi, and Gw\u0101lbansi (Elliot, i, 3). Nanda, with whom Krishna took refuge, was an 'Ahir' chief. The author of the Prabandh Cint\u0101mani (circa 1305 A.D.), in relating the story of the Y\u0101dava R\u0101va of Junag\u0101r\u0101h, called Navaghana \"the Ahir R\u0101va\" (Ra\u015bm\u0101la, p. 118), while an inscription calls the same family \"Y\u0101dava.\" In the Central Provinces, where the Ahir are numerous, they seem to be connected with some traditional \"G\u0101oli\" of former importance, and their name survives in Gw\u0101l\u016br, G\u0101valgarh, Gol-khanda, etc. The Abhira appear in the Samudra Gupta inscription, and are the people of Ptolemy's Abhiria.\nHere, too, 'King Vrihadbala of Kosala' is just named as taking side with the Kurus, but without the least allusion to Ayodhya, or to any remarkable dignity or power of his kingdom.\n\nThe separate character of the Y\u0101dava, Lunar, and Solar lines so far appears clear; and, moreover, the Y\u0101dava themselves become so subdivided that distinct centres naturally arise. This separation of 'Eastern' and 'Western' Aryans would not only facilitate the growth of different linguistic and physical features; it would entail much difference in ideas of caste and religion. It is only necessary to recollect the entire change that came over 'Hindu' religious ideas as they developed from the Vedic stage to that of the Pur\u0101\u1e47a and Tantra; and the caste rules of later days were so little developed in Vedic times that the tribes of those days in their first movement could have carried with them, to the west, very few such restrictions. The whole of the systems of religion, law, and philosophy, as well as the literature, which we associate with the term 'Hindu,' were in fact developed by Brahmans and among the Eastern group after their settlement throughout \u0100ry\u0101varta. The Y\u0101dava and their congeners would have, originally, no part in this progress. In the Indus Valley and Western India, the Aryan element could mix without hindrance with at least the superior families of other tribes or families\u2014Dravidian, early S\u016b or Abar, and later \u015aak\u0101 and Y\u016b-chi\u2014such as the Abh\u012bra, N\u0101gba\u1e47si, Andhra, B\u0101l\u0101, \u015aak\u0101, Gurjjara, etc.\u00b9\n\nThen, again, some centuries must have elapsed before the Puranic religion and law reached or were accepted\n\n\u00b9 I do not mean to imply that even the Eastern Aryans very soon, or very completely, acquired strict caste ideas. Not only have we repeated allusions to sages and heroes marrying 'serpent' and other strange, not to say 'inferior,' wives, but a more general laxity long prevailed. Mr. J. F. Hewitt (J.R.A.S., 1889, p. 196) has justly called attention to a conversation in the M. in which Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira says to Nalaya that \"in human society it is difficult to ascertain one's own caste, because of the promiscuous intercourse among the four orders. Men belonging to all the orders have children by women of all the orders.\" This, however, shows that the idea of established 'orders' and of the propriety of caste distinctions, existed; and that is more than can probably be said for early times in Western India.\nby the Y\u0101dava and other ruling races. Whether they long retained a Vedic type of worship in their new settlements, we have no means of knowing; but for centuries they were non-Brahmanic, and Jainism and Buddhism appear at one time dominant in their early history as reflected in the cave-sculptures and other remains. It is notorious, too, that those (independent) faiths are always connected with Northern and Indo-Scythian tribes and the earlier dynasties of the West who had affinities with them. Wherever we can trace a family to the early Y\u0101dava, or to Magadha, or the Indo-Scythian times, or to the N\u0101ga connection, or to princes like the Maurya, we invariably find some early worship of Sun or Serpent giving way to Jainism or Buddhism, as the case may be, before an ultimate prevalence of the worship of \u015aiva or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. On the other hand, none of the Ganges Valley (Lunar) Aryans are non-Brahmanic, nor open to accept Buddhism when it arises. But Brahmanic religion and customs only slowly filtered into the West and South and Lower East. Nor is the fact altered by the possibility of finding an early \u2018Hindu\u2019 prince or dynasty here and there before the general acknowledgment of Brahmanic superiority. Brahman hermits early began to wander, and must have made occasional royal or baronial converts. There are, for example, inscriptions of the \u2018Western Satraps\u2019 which show that there were many Brahmans then in Gujar\u0101t and Upper Dakh\u0101n, though Buddhism was prevalent. If we can judge from the general traditions which prevail, and the certainly foreign character of the Western Brahmans, we shall, I think, conclude that the Brahmanic faith was\n\n---\n\n1 In the M. we hear of Brahmans in the Payosni (Tapti) Valley, and even as far as Gokarna on the West Coast. Among the Kshatrapas we notice Ushavaddatta (probably ruling during the first quarter of the second century). Though a S\u0101k\u0101 by birth, he is believed to have adopted the Brahmanic faith. The inscriptions, with pardonable exaggeration, record how he gave 300,000 cows and other wonderful gifts to Brahmans. He fed, we are told, \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of Brahmans every year, which is obvious nonsense, because such a number could not have been in existence in the West. It cannot be supposed that Brahmans accompanied the Y\u0101dava from the Indus; so that none could be found but hermit wanderers in small groups from the North. (See Bombay Gazetteer, vol. i, pt. 1, p. 125.)\nnot general in Mahar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra before the seventh or eighth century.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe success of the Brahmanic ideal, developed as it was among a small minority of a ruling race, overcoming Buddhism, proving superior to all racial and geographical barriers, is one of the most remarkable facts of Indian history. But Brahmanism really displaced no cherished national divinities; it only ranged or embodied them in a new order; it could admit all kinds of local deities, even the hated N\u0101ga;\\(^2\\) it could devise the most minutely ritualistic and formally objective worship, while, on the other hand, its various schools of subjective speculation could develop a misty pantheism which is reality of nothing and the negation of any intelligible worship whatever. But the greatest strength of Brahmanism lay in its combined social and religious system. It took possession of both the elements of which Hindu Society was made up. One element was the mass of the people\u2014nearly all non-Aryan (or very mixed), agriculturist and industrial; this element provided the modus vivendi for the second. The second element included both the spiritual ruler\u2014the Brahman\u2014and the temporal ruler, the king, and his host of nobles, relations, hangers-on, and officials. Of both elements the Brahmans took complete possession. Their rules of caste were calculated to promote the interests of both. In the case of the lower orders, they fixed a certain, if humble, status of respectability\u2014certain, because there was the abyss of outcastedom below it: but caste, to some extent at least, effected a permanent division of labour, and presented an obstacle to over-competition in any given\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I may refer to the tradition or legend of the K\u0101damba king Mayura-varma, or Mayurasarma, of N. Kanara, introducing eighteen 'agrah\u0101ra' of Brahmans, which could not have been before the seventh century. (See Bom. Gaz., vol. i, pt. 2, p. 660.) As regards Mr. Baine's remark (Census Rep., 1891, Parl. Blue Book, p. 141) that the Mahrathi language is peculiarly Brahmanic, any such feature could have been taken on, just as the introduction of Christianity affected the vocabulary, etc., of many languages that had long been fixed.\n\n\\(^2\\) Nor need I argue about \u015aiva and phallic worship being of Dravidian origin. The whole genesis of \u015aiva worship and the rival Vi\u1e63\u1e47u sect is curious. The Krishna cult seems to have been invented as a bid for popular favour for the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u side against the Saivite.\ntrade or industry. Among the upper classes, caste appealed to family pride and ideas of respectability and dignity.\\(^1\\) But, indeed, the Brahmanic system as a whole\u2014not merely its caste distinctions\u2014attracted all classes. The populace in towns found their religious sense satisfied by the assistance of a family priest, ever ready with his sacred ceremonial and offices arranged in connection with every event and stage in family life. In the country wandering teachers and ascetics attracted eager attention, and shrines and holy places were established all over the continent.\\(^2\\) Nor were the \u2018mela\u2019 or local religious gatherings and periodic pilgrimages without a powerful effect in attracting adherents. To these must be added the power of the Brahman to declare \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 days\u2014the astrological government of life, and his control of supernatural influences by charms and exorcisms, which, in spite of educational progress, continue to be almost as much a power as ever. Nor was the system less adapted to capture the ruling classes. The Brahman made his presence needed at every R\u0101j\u0101\u2019s court, to organize business and direct the State correspondence as well as to declare the sacred law. Here, too, astrology played no unimportant part in securing priestly ascendancy. Kings seem, at all times, to have accepted the traditional position of the Brahman, and never to have had any misgivings as to the great merit of making land-grants and lavishly endowing priestly families. In the developed Hindu State polity, the Brahman Counsellor is as much a part of the Constitution as the R\u0101j\u0101 himself. To this organizing power of the Brahman we undoubtedly ascribe the general spread and immense success of Hinduism over the West, and still more the South, of India, where the Aryan element was otherwise so little diffused. The (Southern) legend of \u0100gastya but symbolizes the process\u2014the Brahman teacher converting the\n\n\\(^1\\) And it is not necessary to say that caste rules had a certain moral utility they had their good aspect as well as their bad.\n\n\\(^2\\) It is notorious to the present day how any ascetic teacher or hermit will gather a following. The effect of shrines and the \u2018melas\u2019 connected with them is equally well known.\nDravidian masses from his hermitage or preaching station, set up at every mysterious point of natural scenery, on mountain peak or riverside. The Brahman minister found his way into the Court of the Scythian Kshatrapa as well as into that of the rude but capable Dravidian princes. He inspired them with a new idea of family dignity and its increase by caste observance;\u00b9 he proceeded to organize the local Court and the public administration; and to judge by the Sanskritic inscriptions only, that Court would often be imagined as more extensively 'Hindu' than it really was. Then, too, some members of a more nearly Aryan military race would be received\u00b2 and given high command, being found useful in introducing improvements into the army. All this happened, not in any rapid flood of Aryan progress, but in the slow course of centuries, and by individual influences.\n\nNor must it be forgotten that the Brahmanic system had not only to reckon with more or less crude Kolarian and Dravidian religious ideas. It had to contend with a rival, and at times powerfully State-protected, Buddhism and Jainism. Moreover (and this chiefly concerns us here), it had to admit and provide for a long and varied series of foreign additions to the ruling and dominating class. For in some parts of India, the orthodox Kshatriya element never existed; in others it had died out, and in others had been replaced by foreign clans who were not indisposed to adopt the form of orthodoxy, so long as their own ruling and conquering position and dignity were provided for. I need not repeat the enumeration of these foreign elements\u2014from the sixth century B.C. down to the sixth century A.D. All were originally outside the pale of Hinduism; and despite\n\n\u00b9 We have examples in the Central Provinces and elsewhere of how the N\u0101ga chiefs discarded their ancient symbol, and accepted 'R\u0101jput' rank and an impossible genealogy for some Epic or Puranic hero. Such princes adopt caste observation with extreme strictness. After some few generations (backed by wealth and success) they are admitted to marriage alliances with R\u0101jput houses of more established reputation.\n\n\u00b2 With reference, for example, to the possibility of some real descendant of P\u0101ndu, or other Aryan Kshatriya of the North, finding his way to power in the Southern 'Pandyan' kingdom.\nthe attractiveness of the Brahmanic system among the long-\nacclimatized Western and Southern peoples, Brahmanic\ninstitutions had a very limited hold on countries like the\nPunj\u0101b, where to this day we find Brahmans indeed every-\nwhere admitted, but not much held in reverence, while their\n'Hindu law' is almost unknown. Everywhere, except in\na few high-caste families in cities, the agricultural tribal\ncustom of inheritance, adoption, marriage, etc., prevails;\nand doubtless the limited influence of Brahmans made it\nso much easier to convert 'R\u0101jput' tribes to Islam (which\nwas common), and helped the establishment of Sikhism.\nVery probably other provinces remote from the Madhyade\u015ba,\nwould furnish similar examples.\n\nNo wonder that so few surviving castes and clans repre-\nsent pure descent of any kind. No wonder, on the other\nhand, that on becoming 'Hindus,' so many began to claim\nkindred with Brahmanic heroes or sages; just as many\nMoslem castes claim descent from Arabian chiefs and saints,\nthough their Hindu origin can hardly be concealed. There\nis, indeed, an obvious gradation of superiority, mental and\nphysical, connected with the higher castes and clans,\nespecially in Northern India; but these mark the superior\nelements of several races, while among them the 'Aryan'\nhas had the best chance. But the mass of middle and lower\ncastes, agricultural or industrial, are either not 'Aryan'\nat all, or represent only the least advanced, and most mixed,\nsections of the race.\n\n(To be continued.)\nART. XI.\u2014The Pre-Aryan Communal Village in India and Europe. By J. F. Hewitt.\n\nIn Mr. Baden-Powell's article, No. XXV of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for July, 1898, on Village Land-Tenures in India, he asks with reference to my letter on the same subject in the Journal of the Society for July, 1897, for further local details on the following points:\n\nI. As to whether the original matriarchal stage of village life described by me is to be found in the primaeval history of both Kolarian and Dravidian tribes, or whether its institutions were only indigenous among one of these groups.\n\nII. On p. 609 he also asks for a statement of the grounds for asserting that the matriarchal form of village I sketched actually prevailed, and for further information as to the locale and actual features of the N\u0101ga and Ooraon villages mentioned by me on p. 631 of my letter of July, 1897.\n\nIII. He asks (p. 611) for further proofs showing that the whole cultivated produce of the village lands was brought into one common stock or central store, whence it was issued for the common meals and common use of the associated cultivators.\n\nIn answering the first question it is necessary to state clearly the distinction which, according to my understanding of the meaning of the terms, separates Kolarians and Dravidians. In the first place, the languages of the two races are radically distinct, the Kolarians or Mundas speaking dialects akin to those of the Mon tribes of Burmah, while the Dravidian tongues are allied to the Madras Tamil, and Tamil is also, I believe, the speech of the Madras Cholas, who there represent the Kols of Western Bengal. There\nis also a distinct difference in the characters of the two races, the Kolarian Mundas being excitable, light-hearted, garrulous, exceedingly sensitive, and not nearly so steadily industrious as the Dravidians, who, as represented by the Bhuyas, their most distinctive tribe, in Chutia Nagpore, are silent, self-contained, indomitably obstinate, and persevering. Both races are dolikho-kephalic, and as a general rule the Kolarians, at least in their dominant tribe, the Ho Kols of Singhbhum, have not the semi-negroid features and thick lips of the Dravidian Bhuyas and Marya or Tree Gonds.\n\nBut neither of these races are to be found now in India in a pure unmixed state. All their component tribes have in the course of past ages and the process of the birth of local nationalities been very much fused together, and thus Dravidian customs are found among the Kolarians and Kolarian among the Dravidians; and as far as I can judge from my own observations I would say that the Marya Gonds of the forests of the Central Provinces in Kakeir and Bustar, where the Mahanuddi and Wardha rivers rise, are the purest representatives in Central India of the original Dravidian stock. The mixed character of the Gonds is proved by the fact that their ruling clans are Turanians, undoubtedly descended from immigrants from Asia Minor, who first introduced into India the sacred oil-seed, the Tilli (Sesamum Orientale) and the northern millets, Jowari (Holcus Sorghum) and Kessari (Paspalum frumentaceum). They were the Gonds of the second immigration described in their national epic, the Song of Lingal, as being born in the caves at the sources of the Jumna. They were thence carried down the river by the flood which arose while they were cooking their kessari millet, and the four fathers of the four ruling Gond clans were saved from death by Lingal and Dame the tortoise, who placed them in safety on the tortoise earth of the Kushika or N\u0101ga race, and taught them to build houses and to found the tribal city of Nur-Bhumi.\u00b9 These immigrants united with the people\n\n\u00b9 Hewitt, \"Ruling Races of Prehistoric Times,\" vol. i, Essay iii, pp. 222, 223.\nof the first immigration, who had come, like the Mundas, from the mountains of the North-East, the hill lands of North Burmah and Southern China, and had become amalgamated with the still earlier Dravidian races born of the forest trees.\n\nIn consequence of this constant intermixture of early indigenous and immigrant races, among whom only the very faintest sense of national as opposed to local distinctions existed, it is somewhat difficult to determine exactly the race among which the distinctly matriarchal customs I have described as regulating the union of the sexes in India arose. For very similar customs to those of India are proved by the writings of Khwang-tzi, the greatest of the followers of Lao-tzi, the apostle of Taoism, to have existed in the primeval villages of China. He in pt. iii, sect. vii, describes the age of the first village founders as that of the Nest-builders, who roosted at night on trees, lived on acorns and chestnuts, and did not know the use of clothes. These people, he says, knew their mothers, but did not know their fathers, and from this state they emerged to become a people who ploughed and ate and wove and made clothes.\u00b9\n\nIn Chutia Nagpore and the adjoining districts of Chuttisgurh we find every stage of village organization existing in India before the institution by the immigrant Jats and Rajputs of Northern India of Bha\u00eech\u00e2r\u00e2 and Pattidari villages, with rights of private property in the soil vested in the families of the village shareholders. The evidence furnished by these early tenures fully proves that this Chinese description of early village life gives a very true account of the origin of Indian villages. The first stage approaching that of the Nest-builders is to be found among the Kolarian Korwas, occupiers of the P\u00e2ts or volcanic plateaux of Jushpore and North-East Sirgujya. These, which were originally one plateau, have been divided into a number of elevated islands, separated from one another by the deep valleys of the rivers rising in these central mountain lands. Each of these is\n\n\u00b9 Legge, \"The Texts of Taoism\": SBE., vol. xi, p. 171.\noccupied by a section of the Korwas, who scatter themselves over its surface in small groups, living in the rudest possible huts, made of tree branches stuck into the ground. But each location is only occupied for two or three years till the fertility of the soil cleared for their encampment is exhausted, and then the occupants move to another tract. The nucleus round which these scattered groups congregate is their Byga or tribal priest, the maker and consecrator of the arrows used by the hunters. He, in the Labsun P\u0101t, which is that which I know best, used always to live in its centre before the Korwas were deported from the Plateau because of their persistent habit of robbing merchants and travellers passing along the roads encircling the base of their rocky fastnesses. The only permanent village among the Korwas was that in the south-west of the P\u0101t formation in the Maini valley. This was the home of the chief of all the scattered clans, the potentate answering to the Manki or head of a Kol Parha or province.\n\nThe next stage succeeding that of the nomade Korwas is found in the Munda and Kol villages, each ruled by its own Munda or headman, while each Parha or union of ten or twelve adjoining villages has, as among the Korwas, its tribal priest.\n\nIn succession to these Munda villages we find those of the Gonds of Chuttisgurlh, where the headman is aided in the management of the village by four or more assistants, the subordinate members of the village Panchayut, who are, as I have described in pp. 635, 636 of my letter in the Journal of July, 1897, the autocratic rulers of the village.\n\nThe transition from these Munda and Gond villages to the elaborately organized villages of the Ooraons, which I have fully described in my \"Ruling Races of Prehistoric Times,\" vol. i, Essay ii, pp. 91-95, is very great. The Ooraon tribes are those ruling the central provinces of the Lohardugga plateau of Chutia Nagpore. This forms the estate, and before our assumption of the Government was the ruling portion of the dominions of the Nagbansi R\u0101jas of Chutia Nagpore. This name means the mother (chut).\ncountry of the N\u0101gas. But this name of Nagpore or the land of the N\u0101gas was also that of the whole Gond kingdom of the Haihaya or Haio-bunsi kings of Central India, extending from the valleys of the Tapti or Nerbudda in the west to the Behar boundaries of the Magadha or Cheroo kings of the Gangetic Valley on the east, and this boundary is still marked by the estates vested in the Ghatwali landowners of Khurrudaha in Hazaribagh and the Ghatwals of Birbhum, Bankoorah, and Midnapore, who were placed to guard the boundaries of the Ghats or mountain passes leading down to the plain. In the remains of the Deshbohi of the old Haihaya kings of Chuttisgurh for 1629 Sbt., 1563 A.D., given to Mr. Chisholm, Settlement Officer of Belaspur, by the descendants of the Sherishtadars or record holders of the Haihaya kings, Chutia Nagpore is named as a subordinate tract of the Haihaya kingdom, and its wealth in gold and diamonds must have made it the most valuable part of their dominions, and have justified its name of the Mother Country of the N\u0101gas. The name Haihaya or Haio-bunsi means, I believe, the sons (bunsi) of the water-snake (haio). They, like the Chutia Nagpore R\u0101jas, used the sign of the N\u0101ga snake as their totem mark, and doubtless wore it (like the Kushika or Kushite Egyptian kings) on their foreheads, where similar marks are worn by all Hindu Vishnuites and Sivites. The land ruled by the Haio-bunsis was once the whole of the Gond lands of Central and North-Eastern India, afterwards called Mah\u0101-Kosala and Kosala, the country of the Kashis or Kushikas. The present R\u0101ja of Huldi in Ghazipur is a Haio-bunsi, and Sir H. Elliot tells us they are also found in Sohajpur. Also in the Vishnu Pur\u0101na the Haihayas are spoken of as the early rulers of Ayodhya or Kosala, and local tradition, as recorded by Sir A. Cunningham, tells us that the oldest name of the country was Gand\u0101 or Gonda. The Ooraou tribes, successors of the Gonds, probably represent the mixed N\u0101ga, Gond, and Munda races under\n\n1 Cunningham, \"Ancient Geography of India,\" p. 908.\ntheir original aspect, before they were subjected to the later influences of the Cheroos or later Jats and the Kshatriya tribes, and the relation in which they stand to the Cheroos is shown by the fact that the owner of the greater part of the Hazaribagh district, an appanage attached to the office of Senapati or Commander-in-Chief of the Chutia Nagpore R\u0101jas, is a Kharwar by caste, and it is from the Kharwars that the Cheroos or Jats are descended.\\(^1\\) The organization of the Ooraon kingdom of the Nagbunsis and of the Haihaya land of Chuttisgurh also shows a later addition to the strength of the ruling authority in the Kaurs and Rantia Kaurs. To these representatives of the Kaur\u0101vyas of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata were allotted the greater number of the frontier estates of Chutia Nagpore and Chuttisgurh, which are still held by their descendants. They were the military guardians of the frontiers, and are thus the equivalents of the Kharwars to whom the office of Commander-in-Chief was entrusted.\n\nThe Ooraons are undoubtedly later immigrants from the North than the millet-growing Gonds. They call themselves the sons of the ass, an animal indigenous to Syria, whence it has been brought to India. They say they were the first people who brought the plough to India, and that they came from the West, the land of Ruhi-das, a name meaning the country (das) of the red men, and similar to that of Rotou, meaning \u2018red,\u2019 by which the Egyptians called the Syrians. They brought also barley, a Mesopotamian plant, with the plough, and one of their chief festivals is the Kurrum festival, held in August, when the villagers dance round the Kurrum, or almond-tree, cut from the forest and planted for the occasion in the centre of the village Akra, or dancing-ground. They wear in their hair yellow sprouts of the young barley plants, sown by the daughters of village headmen in river sand, mixed with turmeric, the sacred plant of the yellow races.\n\n\\(^1\\) For the connection between Cheroos and Jats see Hewitt, \u201cRuling Races of Prehistoric Times,\u201d vol. i, Essay v, p. 484.\nIn their villages we find the Panchayut of the Gonds replaced by the ruling council, composed of the Munda or village headman, the Pahan or village priest, and the Mahto, the village accountant, who became the Patwari of Bengal and the North-West, and the Kulkarni of Bombay. Except the Pahan, these officers do not, like the Munda and Gond headman, hold a separate tract of land as an appanage of their office, but they have allotments in the three tracts of cultivated land set apart for the clans of Bhunhiars, or original settlers, whence the Munda, Pahan, and Mahto are chosen. Thus we have in this organization a distinct instance of clan or guild tenure, and an appropriation of cultured soil to the official village clans in place of the land allotted to the Gond headman, who gets one share out of the five into which the village lands are divided, or to the Munda headman, whose holding certainly in many cases is no larger than that of other well-to-do cultivators, and whose official emoluments consist of the donations of forest produce given him by the ryots.\n\nAnother most distinctive mark of the Ooraon villages is the Manjhus, or royal land, found in every village. This, which represents the headman's share given to the Gond Patel, is a grant appropriated by the R\u0101ja, whose capital was originally in the central province of Khokra, on the Lohardugga plateau. This Manjhus land is tilled, under the superintendence of the Mahto, by the ryots, who hold the lands not appropriated to the Munda, Pahan, and Mahto koonts, or clans, and its produce is stored in the royal granaries.\n\nThese Ooraon villages are all founded on a primaeval Munda basis, and the original Munda R\u0101ja, or Manki, has, by the intermarriage of the ruling family with the successive Ooraon, Kharwar or N\u0101ga, and Kaur invaders, become a Nag-bansi Rajput. The Ooraons, according to their own evidence and that of the Mundas, entered the Lohardugga district peaceably, with the permission of the Mundas, and the truth of this statement is to be found in the existence to the present day of the old Munda Parhas,\neach with its distinctive flag, which have been merged in the large Ooraon provinces of Khokra, Doisa, and Pethoria. Throughout the whole of this area the village lands are held, not in individual, but common property, and the land tilled by each ryot is liable to pass into other hands at the village redistributions. In these redistributions, not only the lands held by the subordinate cultivators, but also those of the headman, come into the common stock. This I can assert positively as to Chuttisgurh, from my own experience as settlement officer in that district, and I believe that in Lohardugga the Munda, Pahan, and Mahto lands are also redistributed. Such distributions have now become very rare among the best cultivated villages in Lohardugga, and as I have never settled a series of Ooraon villages I cannot say whether the clan lands of the Munda, Pahan, and Mahto koonts show by the segregation of their plots, in villages containing a great variety of soils, that they have been subjected to this process, but I have been told by Mr. Webster, who was from 1864 to 1866 Manager under the Court of Wards of the estates of the Chutia Nagpore R\u0101ja, that he has known land to be redistributed in the jungle province of Tori, and, therefore, those allotted to the Munda, Pahan, and Mahto koonts must have been treated in the same way. Thus the right of property vested in the clan was not the right to certain fields in perpetuity, but that to a definite quantity of soil of an equal quality to that originally held, the measurement being, before we introduced linear measurements and maps, made, according to the custom of Chutia Nagpore and Chuttisgurh, by reckoning the unit of land as the area which would be sowed by a maund of seed. A great deal of information on this point might be gathered from an examination of the maps of the Bhunhiari lands of the Mundas, Pahans, and Mahtos of the Lohardugga plateau, prepared by the Surveyors employed by Government under the Bhunhiari Act to inquire into these local land tenures. This inquiry began in 1869, and the Munda, Pahan, and Mahto lands in each village were\nmapped and recorded in the settlement papers, not in the names of the individual tillers of each plot, but under the general heading of the lands of the koont subject to distribution among the clan members according to clan customs. The only plots in these lands held as individual rights were those in the Pahan koont allotted as appanages of his rank to the Pahan chosen to the office among the members of the priestly clan. He thus was in the position of an English rector holding glebe land appropriated to each successive holder of the post.\n\nAs to the matriarchal customs originally associated with these communal village tenures, very distinct traces of them are found among the Mundas, Gonds, Ooraons, and their allied tribes. The rule under which the young men of a neighbouring village of the Parha are invited to the seasonal dances by the girls of another is customary among the Dravidian Juangs and Bhuyas as well as the Kolarian Ho Kols, and everyone who has seen these dances and the orgies accompanying the celebration of these festivals, some of which last for three days and nights, can understand from the evidence of his own eyesight that these gatherings, where rice beer is consumed in enormous quantities, were originally instituted for the propagation of children. These children were in matriarchal days looked on as the legitimately born children of their mother's village, but now those who owe their parentage to these dances are generally legitimized by the subsequent marriage of their parents. Among the Ho Kols these meetings of the girls of one village with the men of another at the great annual M\u0101gh (January-February) festival are prolonged for weeks, during which the united bands go from village to village and dance in the Akraas of those they visit. These orgiastic meetings are, as I have shown in the \"Ruling Races of Prehistoric Times,\" vol. i, Essay iii, pp. 204, 205, described in Rg., viii, 58 (69), 7\u20139, as the times when Indra and the bard used to visit the house of Rudra the red one, the red-headed stick god Bhim-sen of the Gond forest-races, and drink 'Madhu' or intoxicating spirit at these dances. The dances of the\nvillage women are also mentioned in Rg., i, 92, where the beams of the morning sun are said to be like the \"maidens who come trooping out on the shady village green (the Akra under the shade of the Sarna), dressed in their brightest clothes and ranged in order for the dance, bringing with them Soma,\" which was originally an intoxicating liquor. Also, in another hymn, Rg., x, 146, the first stirrings of the birth of the spring leaves are said to be caused by the sound of the dancing cymbals used as musical instruments in these dances.\n\nThe seasonal dances which have now almost, if not quite, disappeared from the Northern India of the Vedic bards, still flourish everywhere in Chutia Nagpore. They are held in the Akra or dancing-ground, under the shade of the Sarna or sacred village grove. This grove is a remnant of the primaeval forest still retained by the first founders of permanent villages, who carved them out of the forest. The village dwellings are placed close to it, and round this centre ran the ring of cultivated land called by the Gonds the ring of the guardian snake. This separated the home of civilized life from the world of death, the land of the uncleared forest. The children begotten near the Akra under the shade of the mother trees were thus the children of the grove, and hence, when marriages succeeded to the matriarchal unions, arose the custom observed by the Bagdis and Bauris of Western Bengal, the Bunjhias, Kharwars, Rautias, Lohars, Mahilis, Mundas, and Santals of Chutia Nagpore, and by the Kurmis throughout India, of marrying all brides to a tree before they were united to their husbands. It was these matriarchal customs which made the tree called Marom by the Gonds, the mother of the Marya or Tree Gonds. It is the memory of this tree mother which is preserved in the name of the mother goddess universally worshipped throughout Southern India as the goddess Mariamma, or the Mother Mari. She is the only Indian deity whose image is always made of wood.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Abb\u00e9 Dubois, \"Hindu Manners, Customs, and Ceremonies,\" edited by Beauchamp, vol. ii, pt. 3, chap. iv, p. 589.\ngoddess called in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Mahish-Mati or the Chief Mother, who is said to rule the southern land of King Nila, conquered by Sah\u0101deva. This is called the land \"where the women are not obliged to confine themselves to one husband.\"\u00b9 This is the land of the Nairs, where the unions between the sexes are governed by a custom directly derived from the matriarchal age. For the Nair woman, though obliged by existing custom to marry, does not, unless she chooses to keep him longer, see her husband after the first month of their union, and for the rest of her life she takes temporary partners according to her fancy, as restricted by tribal rules.\n\nAmong these Nairs is found the custom of educating all children as children of their mother village, which I have described on p. 631 of my letter on the Origin of Indian Land Tenures in the Journal for July, 1897. This custom arose from the rule forbidding the men of any village to become the fathers of the children of the women of their own village. It also survives among the N\u0101gas in Assam, the Marya Gonds, the Juangs, and Ooraons, and under it all boys and girls are placed, as soon as they can leave their mother, under the care of the village elders and matrons. The boys occupy one building and the girls another, and each sex eat together in reminiscence of the days when all the villagers ate a common meal. Among the Juangs, as Mr. Risley tells us in his \"Tribes and Castes of Bengal,\" the boys' residence, called by the Ooraons the Dhumkuria or Bachelors' hall, is also the place where strangers visiting the village are entertained.\n\nThe custom of regarding each village as the family home of united sisters and brothers is also preserved in the Gond conception of the cultivated land as the boundary snake. This belief, which I have described on p. 634 of my previous letter, is preserved in the ritual of eating the sacred snake in all boundary disputes in Chuttisgurh. The village boundary guardian, the Gorait, priest of the Gond boundary god Goraya, who is chosen by lot to mark the boundary,\n\n\u00b9 Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Sabha (Digvijaya) Parva, xxxi.\nsolemnly eats before he starts on his journey a piece of the earth of the boundary, calling it 'the sacred snake,' and when thus inspired by the god, begins his task of walking round the true boundary. That this belief in the boundary snake is not confined to the Gond lands of Chuttisgurh, but extended to the old Gond kingdom of North-East India, is proved by the following story taken from a cutting from Allen's Indian Mail, No. 2,005, of the last week of December, 1896, given me by a friend. It is said to be taken from a note of a recent meeting of the Bombay Anthropological Society. It tells how a boundary dispute arose between the villages Shuknara and Pipra, in Pergunnah Pachlakh in the Sarun district, belonging to the Majhowli Raja of Ghorakpur. The two villages were about to fight for the possession of the disputed land, when the sacred serpent appeared in a dream to the headmen of both villages on the night before the intended battle. He told them not to fight, and he would mark out the true boundary. The next morning the snake came out of a Pakur-tree (Ficus infectoria) close to the Shuknara Masjid, and drew its length over the right boundary.\n\nThe selection in this story of the Pakur mother tree close to the village temple as the sacred tree of the N\u0101ga boundary snake is also significant, as the Pakur is the sacred fig-tree still worshipped at Pureag, the meeting-place of the Jumna and Ganges. This is consecrated as the place where the union between the immigrant Turanian tribes coming down the Jumna and the earlier dwellers in India was consummated, and where the union of the Kushika N\u0101gas who founded the sacred city of Kashi (Benares) was formed. The historical stage indicated by the reverence for the Pakur or Plaksha is also distinctly shown in the Soma ritual, where in the form of Soma worship succeeding that celebrated on the altar thatched with Kusha grass, the parent grass of the Kushikas, forming the ring still used in the marriage of Kushika cultivating tribes,\u00b9 Plaksha branches\n\n\u00b9 Hewitt, \"Ruling Races of Prehistoric Times,\" vol. i, Essay iii, p. 176, note 2; p. 280.\nare ordered to be placed as coverings on the altar above the thatching of Kusha grass. The altar thus covered was that used for animal sacrifices, showing that the ritual was earlier than that of the Soma altar, where only milk in various forms, barley, and running water were mixed in the Soma cup.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe national snake-god of the Gonds is the god Sek N\u0101g, the rain-god whose image of a wooden snake is placed in his shrine under the national parent tree, the Saya (*Terminalia tomentosa*). Only men worship him, and his worshippers must come to his shrine perfectly naked. That he is a sea-god is shown by the offerings made to him\u2014seven coconuts which only bear fruit within the influence of the sea-breeze, seven pieces of betel-nut, milk, and flowers, but no animal victims. This absence of animal sacrifices in his ritual proves that his worship dates back to the days of the tree mother and the father tree ape, the Gond god Maroti, to neither of whom are offered the animal sacrifices introduced by the Northern immigrant sons of animal totems. This god becomes, in the ritual of the Takkas of the Panjab, Shesh N\u0101g, who rules the Winter season of the year, the Spring and Summer seasons being ruled by Takht N\u0101g and B\u0101suk N\u0101g. These three N\u0101ga gods form the prongs of the holy trident worshipped by the Takkas, and this trident is the descendant of the Gond trident of Pharsi Pen or the female (*pen*) trident (*pharsi*), composed now of the iron rod and central prong called Pharsipot inserted into the female bamboo, while the two outer prongs are called Manko Rayetal and Jango Rayetal, his two tiger wives. These are the tiger mothers of the Malli or Mon race, who with the Licchavis, the sons of the Akkadian lion or dog Lig, constitute the confederacy of the Vaggians (Sanskrit, Vyaghra; Pali, Vyaggho), who ruled North-Eastern India, the kingdom of the Gonds, in the lifetime of the Buddha. The name Pharsi Pen or the female trident given to this sacred sign of the year-god of\n\n\\(^1\\) Eggeling\u2019s *Sat. Br\u0101h.*, iii, 5. 1. 36; iii, p. 3, 10\u201312.

It was from this ocean that he made the holy ass Uchchai-shra-vas, the horse of Indra with the long ears, to emerge by making the mountain revolve, as in their belief the earth revolved under the guidance of the Pole Star.\n\nThis ass is the sun-god of the Summer season of the year of three seasons, called in the Bandahish, xix, 1\u201311,\u00b9 the three-legged ass with three feet and six eyes. He is the counterpart and successor of the snake Azi Dah\u0101ka, the V\u1e5bitra of the Rigveda, with three heads and six eyes.\u00b2 It is he who helps Tishtriya (Sirius) to draw from the ocean the rain which is to water the earth at the close of the burning Summer, and which falls in North India during the rainy season at the Summer solstice ruled by Sirius. This ass, who succeeded the sacred V\u1e5bitra or enclosing (vr\u012b) snake of the Rigveda as the god slain by Indra, is the totem god of the Ooraons, who are also, as I have shown above, closely connected with the Kharwars, the parent tribe of the Cheroos ruled by Vasu.\n\nThe god Vasu is also said in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\u00b3 to be the god-king of the P\u016bruvas, or eastern people, whom we have seen to be the sons of the tiger dwelling in the land of Chedi, the land of the birds (Ched or Chir), the country of the Cheroos rulers of Magadha. He is said to have set up on the Sakti mountains, the Kymore range forming south of Benares the southern boundary of the Gangetic Valley, the bamboo pole, the female bamboo of the trident of Pharsi Pen, as the sign of the divinity. This he crowned\n\n\u00b9 West's \"Bandahish\"; SBE., vol. v, pp. 67\u201369.\n\u00b2 Darmesteter's \"Zendavesta \u0100b\u0101n Yasht,\" ix, 34.

His name, derived from the root *indu*, shows him to be the god Ind or Aind, the eel or water-snake, the totem of the Haihayas, or Ha\u00efos, and also of the Kherias, Cheroos, Kharwars, Mundas, Rautia Kaurs, Asuras, Gualas, Pans, and Santals; in short, of all the ruling primitive tribes of Chutia Nagpore and Western Bengal, the mining races who developed the mineral wealth of Chutia Nagpore, and made it the treasure-house of the early N\u0101ga kings. This eel was, as Herodotus tells us (ii, 72), worshipped by the Egyptians, who also adored the N\u0101ga snake of the Hindu Kushika, or Kushites. It was the parent fish of the Sanskrit Matsya, sons of the fish from whom the royal races of India were descended. He and his sister Satya-vat\u012b, wife of Shantanu, and thus ancestress of the Kaur\u0101vyas and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, the conquering races of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, were born, as that ancient historical poem tells us, from Vasu and his hawk wife.\u00b9 She was the Hindu equivalent of the Greek goddess Circe or Kirke, from \u03ba\u03af\u03c1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, 'the hawk,' and the root *kir* reappears in India as the Chir or bird-mother of the Cheroos. In Egypt she was the hawk-headed goddess Hat-hor, whose son Horus always is depicted with a hawk's head. Mr. Boscawen tells us that the image of the sun-mother hawk is engraved as the sign of the guardian god on the walls of the oldest mines in Egypt.\u00b2 The sons of the hawk, the Cheroos, were the successors of the trident-worshipping Takkas, and they are named as the second of the Dri-dasyas, the three (*dri*) country-born races (*dasya*) in the Madras list of the three races, the Cholas or Kolas, the Cheroos, and Pandyas, descended from Agastya, the star Canopus, and Lop\u0101-mudr\u0101, the fox (*lop\u0101-sha*) mother, the moon-goddess.\u00b3\n\nThe original fish or water-snake, Sek or Shesh N\u0101g, who was the god of the Spring season in the Takka triad, is\n\n\u00b9 Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Adi (Adivasavatams) Parva, lxiii, pp. 174, 175.\n\u00b2 Hewitt, \"Ruling Races of Prehistoric Times,\" Preface, pp. xxxvii, xxxviii.\n\u00b3 Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata Vana (Tirtha-yatra) Parva, xovi, xcvi, pp. 307-314.\nthe Vedic Suk-ra, another form of Indra. The mountain Mandara, which he surrounded as the ocean-snake, is the forest-clad hill called Paris-nath, the lord (n\u0101th) of the traders (Pa\u1e47is or Panris) on the Burakur in Chutia Nagpore. It is still one of the most sacred shrines of all the Jains of India, whose earliest shrines are in Kh\u0101ti\u0101war in the West of India. The great majority of the Jains are traders and bankers, and they, according to the genealogy of their Tirtha-karas, their twenty-four parent gods, are descended from Rishabha, the bull (rishabha) of Kosala and the mountain (maru) goddess Maru-devi. The image of their mountain mother, encircled by the ocean-snake, reappears in the conception of the earth in the Edda, where its centre is Mount Asgard, surrounded by the Midgard serpent, and crowned with the mother-tree, the sacred ash, Ygg-drasil.\n\nThese historical stories of Vasu, the sacred mountain, and Shesh N\u0101g, filtered down into the theology of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the Vedas, through Gond, Takka, and Cheroo tribal traditions, are all shown by the Takka mythology to point to the year of three seasons indicated by the three gods of the Takka trident. But as in this mythology Vasu or V\u0101suk N\u0101g is said to have added himself as ruler of Summer to an actual year formerly consisting of Shesh N\u0101g, the Spring and Summer, and Takt or Taksh N\u0101g, the Winter season, it is clear that the year of Vasu was preceded by one reckoned by two seasons. These are the two seasons of the year of the Munda sun-bird, the sacred jungle-fowl, which begins its annual circuit round the heavens with the Winter solstice, when the Sohrai Saturnalia of the Santals and the Pongol or year festival of Madras is held. It makes its journey from the south to the north during the six months called in Hindu ritual the Devay\u0101na. At the Summer solstice it turns back again from the north to the south, during the six months season of the Pitri-y\u0101na, and ends its yearly course in the south, with the sun at the Winter solstice. This is the sun-course represented in the two S\u016b-astikas,\ncalled female and male, the sacred signs of all the Jain traders of Western India; the female S\u016b-astika, or S\u016b-v-astika, marking the northerly course of the sun as going widershins, or from right to left, and the male S\u016b-astika, representing its southern or desil course from north to south or from left to right. This last is the holy circuit, the Sanskrit Pradakshina, the P\u0101li Padakkhino, of the Brahmins and Buddhists, and the latter in the Buddhist books are represented as thus going round the Buddha with their right sides towards him. This male S\u016b-astika is also depicted on the feet of the Buddha.\n\nThe earlier mother sun-bird, who began her course at the Winter solstice, is the Shyena or frost (shya) bird of Rg., iv, 27, who was wounded by the arrow of Krish\u0101nu, the rainbow-god, the drawer (karsh) of the heavenly bow, the god who brings the Winter rains. With her blood one of her feathers fell to earth, and grew in the Spring following the Winter solstice into the Pal\u0101sha-tree (Butea frondosa), as we are told in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as.1 This Pal\u0101sha-tree, called Shyena-hrita, or the tree sacred to the Shyena bird,2 is the most ancient of the sacred trees of which the sap supplied the holy Soma juice, and it is also the sacred tree of the Mundas. The arrow with which it was slain represents, according to the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as,3 the year of the three seasons of the Upasads succeeding that of two, its feather being the Spring, its shaft the Summer, and its barb the Winter, and the whole story of the arrow and the bird tells of the coming of a northern race, who used the bow instead of the Dravidian boomerang.\n\nBut the year of the sun-bird of the Eastern Mundas, Suntals, and Madras Dravidians, which became the orthodox Brahminical year, the year of the Vedic god Tvashtar, or the most complete two, was not the earliest year of the founders of the Indian communal village carved from\n\n---\n\n1 Eggeling's Sat.

This is the year observed by all traders in Western India, who close their books on the 26th of October, to prepare for the Dewali or Dib\u0101li festival, held at the beginning of November. This November feast of lamps is still celebrated in Japan, and was also held in Egypt in connection with the yearly burying of Osiris, the star Orion, the god of the old year at the same season in Egypt.\\(^1\\) This is the year of the people of the Southern Hemisphere, who as ancestors of the forest races of India, the first founders of villages, were led by the exigencies of agriculture, which rendered a knowledge of the times and seasons a necessary part of a farmer's education, to seek for a method of measuring annual time. They did not seek this knowledge in the course of the sun, the evil spirit which burnt up their crops unless its heat was tempered by constant rain, but in the stars, which rose, culminated, and set like the sun. Their object was to find a constellation which marked the 1st of November, the beginning of their Spring. This they found in the Pleiades, which, as they noted, set immediately after the sun on the 1st of November, and continued to set later than the sun up to the beginning of April, when they were no longer visible in the night sky. They reappeared again in May, to set before the sun, and this they continued to do till the end of October. Thus their year was divided into two seasons of six months each, from November to May, and May to November, the first year of the parent year gods called the two (\\(tva\\)), who became, when this year was succeeded by the Munda sun-year, the Tvashtar or superlative two of the Rigveda. This Pleiades year begins everywhere throughout the Southern Hemisphere with a three days' feast to the dead.\n\n\\(^1\\) H. Brugsch, \"Religion und Mythologie der alter Aegypter,\" pp. 303, 346, 617. Hewitt, \"Ruling Races of Prehistoric Times,\" vol. i, Essay ii, pp. 124-126.\nA story was invented to explain the motions of the stars headed by the Pleiades, and its most picturesque form is that surviving in Australia. According to this, the Queen of the Pleiades found a tree-grub in a forest-tree and took it out. It became the giant star Canopus and ran away with her, that is to say, dragged her and her attendant stars round the heavens. This became among the Dravidians the story which represented the giant ape, the Gond tree ape god Maroti, as sitting on the top of the central tree of the world\u2019s village grove and dragging the stars round the Pole. This survives in Egyptian astronomy, in which the stars of the Great Bear are called the Thigh of Set, and Set, whose name according to Brugsch means the vanquished (st) god, is the god originally called Hapi in Egyptian form of the Tamil Kapi the ape. In the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a this story appears as that of the marriage of Su-griva, the ape king, with T\u0101r\u0101 the Pole Star, and it is Su-griva who, with Hanuman, the Gond tree ape god, Maroti helps R\u0101ma, the ploughing ox-god, to visit S\u012bt\u0101, the furrow, in the island of Lanka (Ceylon) by means of the bridge formed of 360,000 apes, that is to say, by the 360 days of the year. T\u0101r\u0101, again, is the Buddhist mother goddess worshipped at Buddh-Gaya and in Thibet, the goddess T\u0101r\u0101 Pennu or the female (pen) T\u0101r\u0101 of the Khonds and other ruling races of the earliest northern immigrations to Orissa and Chutia Nagpore. This ape star god, the star Canopus of Southern astronomy, called Agastiya in the Rigveda and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, is the father god of all Southern India, who was, as we have seen, by Lop\u0101mudr\u0101 his wife, mentioned with him in Rg., i, 179, father of the Dri-dasyas, the Cholas, Cheroos, and Pandyas. The fingers of this ape god, with which he dragged the Pleiades round the Pole, appear in the reckoning of the early Pleiades year as the five days of the weeks into which it was divided. There were seventy-two weeks of five days each, the five fingers of his mighty hand, reckoned in this year. Thus each of its two seasons of six months contained thirty-six weeks, the thirty-six steps of Vishnu, the year-god of Hindu mythology. This is the\nweek of the Shans of North Burmah, who hold their markets at intervals of five days. It was also the week of the people of the Gangetic Doab, called in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the Panch\u0101las or men of five (panch) claws (ala), also called, both in this poem and the Rigveda, the Srinjayas, or men of the sickle (srini). This was the week they reckoned in their first sun-year, reckoned by months, the eighteen months' year represented in the ritual of the Ashvamedha sacrifice recorded in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, by the eighteen sacrificial stakes then erected in place of the eleven hitherto set up to represent the year of gestation of the sun-horse, that of eleven lunar months. It was also the week of the Zend, called the Punchak fartum, represented in the seventy-two threads of the Zend girdle, which, like the three knots of the Brahmin's girdle, tied to represent the three seasons of the year, recalled the memory of the primaeval five days' week. It was also the Fimt, the name of the five days' week of the Scandinavians.\n\nI have now shown in this sketch of the development and extension of the matriarchal village customs, with the accompaniment of a communal tenure of land, that this primaeval system originating in the south, was gradually spread by the northern advance of the southern forest races all over India. The evidence also shows that these customs were in part taken over by the first northern immigrants, the Mundas and Turanian Gonds, and that among these early founders of primitive states, divided into Parhas or Provinces, the Pergunnahs of Bengal and the North-West, the first villages each contained its central Sarna or sacred village grove, and its Akra or dancing-ground, where the matriarchal unions of the sexes were consummated at the seasonal dances. Also that the first northern immigrants from the south brought with them their year, reckoned by the movements of the Pleiades, beginning with its three days' feast to the dead, and this\n\n1 For the full proof of this see my \"History of the Sun-God as the Great Physician,\" Westminster Review, April, 1896, pp. 363, 364; and my \"History of the Week,\" Westminster Review, July, 1897, p. 966.\nyear was by the Mundas replaced by their solsticial year of the sun-bird, also divided like the Pleiades year into seventy-two weeks of five days each. For the original three days' feast to the dead beginning the November year, there was substituted by the corn-growing Syrian immigrants from the north, who instituted the year measured by equinoxes as well as solstices, the present Hindu Shraddha held in Bhadon, at the autumnal equinox. This was the time when the original Syrian and Macedonian solar year, the year still used by the Jews, began.\n\nBut the Indian evidence as to the matriarchal, social, and territorial customs of the earliest founders of villages is not the only evidence adducible on the subject, for, as I shall now proceed to show, we find in Europe and South-Western Asia evidence proving the existence there of the Indian matriarchal system, and thus corroborating that I have shown to exist in India. Also this evidence gives us as to certain details, especially those connected with the ancient custom of common meals, more exact proof than that can be gathered from India, where it has been almost everywhere destroyed by the caste system, which again originated from the earlier division of the country into villages, where the inhabitants fed together, and from the system of trade guilds introduced by the Kushika, under which, as in Europe, the guildsmen dined together.\u00b9\n\nThese early village founders, in making their way through the country to seek new sites for the settlements of the growing population, used the natural high roads supplied by the rivers and the sea. It was on the river banks and the western sea-coasts of India, covered with forests down to the water's edge, that they learned the arts of boat-building and navigation. As the possessors of these arts, it was they who first introduced maritime trade and civilization into the coast lands of the Indian Ocean, for, except on the Malabar coast of India and those of the islands of the Archipelago, no ship-building timber is found elsewhere.\n\n\u00b9 Hewitt, \"Ruling Races of Prehistoric Times,\" vol. i, Preface, pp. lviii, lix; Essays ii and iii, pp. 87, 310, 311.\nnear the sea over its whole extent. It was in the course of these coasting voyages to seek new lands more accessible than those situated far from the rivers among the tangled woods, that they gradually made their way to the Persian Gulf in the boats which were henceforth used throughout Assyria and Egypt to represent the dwelling-places of these national gods, the arks in which they were carried in all religious processions. There they found good arable land, but the sandy soil was not well suited to their rice, and hence, as they in India had grown rice from the wild grass, still hung up in August in the houses of all ryots in Central India, as the parent rice plant, so their descendants in Mesopotamia found the wild grasses, whence, as all botanists now agree, our European barley and wheat were originally produced. These people came to Asia Minor at the close of the Palaeolithic Age, the age of the Glacial epochs, when cultivation in Europe was all but impossible, and united with the hunting races, the river-dwellers, who were the sole inhabitants of the country during the Ice Age. It was these that were known as men, the hunting star, for centuries as the leaders of peoples and their attendant gods. The Argonauts in Argo ceased to be seen as the heroes of a race, and it was thence that the same processes of life Europe as the dwellers of the Nile. These, as Lubbock and Boyd have shown, grew rice crops grown and all the beasts of prey, and began to Asia Minor and South-western Europe took with them their reverence for the sacred tree, preserved in the sacred grove and temple Temenos forming the sacred places of towns and villages. The seasonal festivals connected in the dances to Istar, Mylitta, Venus, and the matriarchal national cults of Amazonian rule of women along the Nile, in ancient Egypt and in Ancient Greece. The later goddesses of Istar of a later age represent the\n\n1. \"India as a Prehistoric Times,\" vol. i, Essay iii, pp. 280 ff.\nvillage women of the matriarchal epoch, and the Babylonian customs of the worship of Mylitta, which obliged all women to appear at her temple before their marriage and there unite themselves with the first male worshipper who chose them, show clearly their derivation from matriarchal village unions. The custom of common meals was preserved by the Cretans, Spartans, the Oenotrians and Sikels of South Italy and Sicily, the Arcadians of Phygalia, and the Argives. It was observed at Megara in the days of Theognis, and was said to have been introduced into Corinth by Periander, and Aristotle in his Politics tells us that these meals were taken from the common granaries (\u1f10\u03ba \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6).\u00b9 The pramaeval custom of common meals was universally preserved in Italy and Greece by the common ceremonies performed in each city at its public festivals. These were always, as Mons. Fustel de Coulanges has shown in his graphic work \"La Cit\u00e9 Antique,\" accompanied by common meals partaken of by all the inhabitants.\u00b2 We have also in the Bible a reminiscence of these common sacrificial meals in the feast held by Samuel as national prophet at Ramah, where the sacrificed victims were eaten, and the thigh, the part of the victim assigned to the priest, was set before Saul as the national priest and king.\u00b3 But this feast was, as the number of guests was restricted, a guild feast of the priestly guild which succeeded the village festivals.\n\nThe Indian division of the country into Parhas, each with its central village, the residence of the Manki, was reproduced in the divisions of Palestine recorded in Joshua, where each province with its villages is named after its central city. Also the Nomes of Egypt were constituted in an exactly similar manner, only that in these Nomes the totem system of descent was preserved more clearly than in India, for the villages and capital city of each Nome\n\n\u00b9 M\u00fcller, \"Die Dorier,\" Bk. iii, p. 199; Bk. iv, chap. iii, p. 269.

In Abyssinia, whence the Kushite kings came to Egypt, the Indian village with its central grove still exists, and this grove dedicated to the temple is now the site of the village church. Also the village groves were a most prominent feature in the national religion of Palestine. The village Town Hall, the Gemeinde Haus of Germany and the Gemeente Haus of Flanders, is a surviving relic of the Bachelor's Hall of the matriarchists, which exists everywhere where the communal tenure of land prevails. The annual or less frequent redistribution of land at the close of a series of years which marked the communal tenure of the Indian villages also survived in the villages of South-Western Asia and Europe. The Rev. J. Neill, in an article on \"Land Tenure in the Village Communities of Palestine,\" published in No. xlv, vol. xxiv, of the Transactions of the Victoria Institute, describes how the village lands are annually redistributed among the cultivators exactly in the same way as was customary in Chhattisgurh, and Tacitus has described the existence of similar customs among the Suabians of South Germany, where they still, as I know, existed at intervals of years till recently, and still every purchaser of a peasant's land has to pay an additional sum to the commune for right of entry, thus showing the peasant not to be the full proprietor of the land. That they formerly obtained in England is proved by the annual distribution of common lands, such as the Lammas lands of Coventry, and that the methods of distribution were exactly similar to those used in India is proved by an instance quoted by Sir H. Elliot from Collinson's \"Somersetshire,\" vol. iii, p. 586. He tells how before 1811, when the lands of the parishes of Congresbury and Puxton, called Dal-moore, were enclosed, they used to be annually redistributed to the inhabitants of the parishes. They were divided into strips, each covering an acre, and bearing a peculiar and different mark cut in the turf, such as a horse, four oxen and a mare.\n\n1 Bent, \"Sacred City of the Ethiopians,\" chap. viii, p. 138.\ntwo oxen and a mare, a pole-axe, duck's nest, hand reel, and hare's tail, etc. The fields were thus named in an exactly similar way to that still in use in Chutia Nagpore. On the Saturday before old Midsummer, the tenants of the proprietors of estates in Congresbury, Puxton, and West St. Lawrence used to assemble on these lands, and a number of apples, each marked with the mark of a field, are put into a bag, and each tenant took possession for the ensuing year of the plot bearing the mark of the apple he drew. Four acres were also reserved for the payment of expenses, and these were let by an inch of candle. These answer to the Beth-kheta lands in Ooraon villages in Chutia Nagpore, lands held in common among the ryots for the payment of village expenses and allotted to different ryots in turn.\n\nBut besides this evidence of the transference from India to Europe of matriarchal social customs, and those connected with the tenure and distribution of land, there is also most cogent evidence furnished by the custom of reckoning the year beginning in November. This was the year of the Druids, the priests of the mother-tree (dru), who always began their year in November, and it was then that the Druid nuns were obliged to pull down and rebuild the roof of their temple, and it was then that the annual fires were lit. Also the year began with the three days' feast to the dead, still preserved all over Europe in the three sacred days of All Hallows Eve, All Saints, and All Souls Day. It is still the custom in several counties in England for farm servants to be hired for the year from the 1st November. Also the beginning of the second season of the year, from May to November, is celebrated in the May festivals, accompanied by the annual perambulation and marking of boundaries, a survival of the Indian ritual of the boundary snake-god.\n\nThis snake-god survived in Greece in the Echis, the\n\n---\n\n1 Elliot, \"Supplementary Glossary, N.W.P.\", p. 264.\n2 Also all Mayors and Corporations in English towns are elected annually on the 1st of November.\nparent snake killed by Cadmus, and the father of the Achaioi. This snake was the Sanskrit Ah\u015b, the budding snake who appears in Vedic mythology as the \u0100h\u015b\u0101r B\u1e5bhadhy\u0101, the ocean- (b\u1e5bhadhy\u0101) snake encircling the base of the mother mountain, the Python or snake of the depths (B\u1e5bhadhy\u0101) of Delphi. The Ah\u015b, again, is the snake V\u1e5bitra slain by Indra, and his name, from the root v\u1e5bt, means the circling snake, or snake of the Indus village. The Greeks still call themselves his children, i.e., according to Mannhardt, in Greek villages at the present day all unbaptized boys are called \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd, 'male snakes or dragons,' and girls \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd, 'female snakes or dragons.'\n\nBut one of the most telling pieces of evidence as to the transference of these matriarchal customs to Greece is furnished by the festival of the Thesmophoriazousai. This festival, while apparently a Northern reproduction of the universal Mithraic festival of firstfruits, held in the Southern hemisphere at the beginning of the November month, according to Herodotus, ii, 171, introduced among the Thracians the cult of Danaus, the Indian D\u0101nava, the Danu, the Pole-star God. It was, however, held in a cavern by the women of the cities founded by the matriarchal races, and took place on the 11th, 12th, and 13th of November (November), answering to the 24th, 25th, and 26th of October, and was held at night, showing the constellations of the southern races, who began their year with the rising of the sun in the morning, but ended it with the stars led by the Pleiades at night. Two women of each demos or village took part in it, and two were chosen by the rest as rulers. Pigs were sacrificed to the mother De-meter, the mother, just as in India pigs are sacrificed to the Sun, the sun-god of the ploughing races. The fruits consecrated to the snake parent gods, and a fruit consecrated to the sun, were allowed\n\n---\n\n1 Mannhardt, \"Die Wald und Feld Kultur,\" vol. ii, chap. ii, p. 63.\nThis feast was followed by the Chalkeia, held on the 19th of Puanepson, the 1st of November. This was dedicated to Athene and Hephaistos, the latter being the god of the fire-drill. Between these two were held the village feast of the Apaturia, when the assembly of the phatria of each village was held, the lists of members of the village community revised, and the young men who were sufficiently old for admission received the \u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, or grant of cultivated land, allotted to them, a grant which necessitated the rearrangement of the village lands. It was at this feast that the year's fires were lighted from the central fire of the village, the hearth dedicated to the goddess Hestia, the Roman Vesta. At this fire each man lighted the torch which was to light his household fire, and these were carried in procession through the village. Similarly these fires were lighted among the Druids, and this feast of the annual relighting of fires is called in Wales and Ireland Samain. It lasts for three days before and three days after the 1st of November.\n\nI have now shown, in this review of the customs and institutions of the primitive villages, that in their earliest form no individual right of property in any piece of land was recognized. The tenures were thus entirely distinct from those of the Gothic Hof Bauers of North-West Germany, who, with the Bratsvenici Slavs of the Balkans, were the ancestors of the Indian Jats. To each Bauerschaft or Bratsvo a definite estate belonged, which was divided into separate portions allotted to each family, as in Bh\u0101y\u0101ch\u0101ra villages in India. In Europe each family had its land, and each tribal territory was marked by its distinct boundary-marks, the origin of our hedges, which are never seen in the communal villages of Belgium, Eastern France, or South Germany, except where a tract held by private proprietors exists. It was these marrying Goths who were the precursors of the later Aryan Celts of the Vedic age, the people who\n\n1 Rhys, \"Hibbert Lectures for 1881,\" pp. 517, 518.\n2 Jevons Schrader's \"Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryans,\" part iv, chap. xii, sect. vi, p 307.\nburnt their dead, and who superimposed rights of private property in India, which have, wherever the Mitakshara and Dhayabhaga codes prevail, superseded those of the earlier village communities.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Baden-Powell's remark, in p. 611, that it seems to him very improbable that once the cultivator had no separate interest in the plot or aggregate of plots he was told to cultivate, I would remark that, as all the produce of the whole cultivated tract was once stored in the common granary (as in the Cretan villages described by Aristotle), he could have no possible private interest in the produce. Similarly the produce of all freshly cleared land belonged to the community, and the land itself, if cleared by any one individual cultivator, was included in the cultivated land of the village at the next distribution.\nART.

Cunningham, little of importance has since been written on the history of this dynasty. The Pandit\u2019s article is still the best and fullest account of the subject taken as a whole. So much new information has, however, been obtained from the coins\u2014partly from specimens recently brought to light, and partly from a more minute scrutiny of specimens previously known\u2014that a supplementary account has become necessary. The following notes profess merely to supply addenda et corrigenda to the article in question, and are not intended in any way to supersede it.\n\nThe most important results have been obtained from the collection of the coins of the Western K\u1e63atrapas made by Colonel J. Biddulph, while Resident at Baroda, and many of the new facts now published are due to his patient and painstaking observations.\n\nWhen our manuscript was about to be sent to the printer, I received a very interesting letter from the Rev. H. R. Scott, giving an account of the investigation by\n\n1 J.R.A.S., 1890, p. 639. In the following pages, this article is referred to as BH.\nMr. Vallabhji Haridatta and himself of the K\u1e63atrapa coins\u2014two or three hundred in number\u2014in the Watson Museum at Rajkot. These observations, which confirm our conclusions in some instances, and suggest further possibilities in others, have been added to our notes.\n\nThe Obverse Inscriptions in 'Greek' Characters.\n\nAs is well known, the coins of the K\u1e63atrapas, throughout the whole duration of the dynasty, generally bear on the obverse traces of what seems to be undoubtedly an inscription\u2014or rather, perhaps, in most cases, an imitation of an inscription\u2014in Greek characters. This is clearest during the period when the workmanship is at its best, i.e. approximately from the reign of D\u0101majada\u015b\u012b, son of Rudrad\u0101man, to that of Vijayasena, son of D\u0101masena; and, in their endeavours to decipher these enigmatical coin-legends, numismatists have naturally selected for study those specimens on which they were most clearly and completely expressed.\u00b9 There seems to be little doubt, however, that at this time (roughly from about 90 to 170 of the K\u1e63atrapa era = A.D. 168 to 248), this Greek inscription had lost all meaning, and continued to be reproduced mechanically and unintelligently as a sort of ornamental border. If so, the failure of the numismatists to give any satisfactory explanation is not to be wondered at. The best hope of recovering the lost meaning lay evidently in a study of the earliest coins of this class\u2014those of Nahap\u0101na and Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana\u2014which belonged to a period when these Greek inscriptions possibly still had some significance; but, unfortunately, all the known specimens of Nahap\u0101na and Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana were lamentably deficient and fragmentary in this respect.\n\nAn unusually well preserved coin of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana, belonging to Colonel Biddulph, supplies, I believe, the clue to the proper explanation of these obverse inscriptions in Greek\n\n\u00b9 Rapson, \"Indian Coins\" [B\u00fchler's Grundriss, ii, 3b], \u00a7 81, for references to the various attempts made to explain these coin-legends.\ncharacters; and the recognition of this fact is due, in the first place, to Mr. G. F. Hill, who immediately saw that the name of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana actually appears here as CiACTANCA (inf., p. 370, Pl. 2). From this observation, the natural inference followed that these Greek inscriptions are, after all, nothing but what might have been expected, i.e. either translations or transliterations of the Indian inscriptions on the reverse. If the attempt to restore these fragmentary coin-legends be made from this point of view, it will be quite evident that they are not translations. There are no traces, for instance, of the word \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3, which would naturally have been used to translate raj\u00f1o; but there will be very good reason to suppose that they are transliterations.\n\nIn the case of the coins of Nahap\u0101na, for example, the Indian inscriptions on the reverse are\u2014Raj\u00f1o K\u1e63aharataasa Nahap\u0101nasasa (Br\u0101hm\u012b), and Ra\u00f1o Chaharatasasa Nahap\u0101nasasa (Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b). The obverse inscriptions on all the available specimens are, unfortunately, very fragmentary. The remaining traces, if read from the top downwards\u2014the direction in which the corresponding Indian inscriptions on the reverse invariably proceed at this period\u2014are as follows\u00b9:\n\n(1) . A . . . . . CCNA[A[\u03a0A]. Bh.\n(2) . ANNI\u03a9IAT\u039b\u039b\u0394CCNA[?]N\u039b[ Bh.\n(3) PAN[N] . . . . . [\u03a0]A[?]NACC Col. Shepherd.\n\nNow there can surely be no doubt that the first word PANNI\u03a9 is intended to represent raj\u00f1o or ra\u00f1o, and that the third word NAA[\u03a0]A[?]NACC contains in blundered fashion the name Nahap\u0101na in the genitive. With regard\n\n\u00b9 It may be mentioned that in these copies the restorations within brackets are in every case probable, and seem to be justified by the traces which remain of the letters. A note of interrogation has been substituted whenever the visible traces do not suggest a probable restoration. It is interesting to note that Colonel Shepherd's coin alone of all the available coins of Nahap\u0101na and Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana preserves the letter P of PANNI\u03a9 distinct, and thus verifies a conjecture which had been made before its appearance.\nto the second word, the greater part of which is to be seen on only one of the three coins, there is less certainty. \u0399\u0391\u03a4\u039b\u039b\u0394\u0393\u0393 can scarcely, after all allowance for blundering has been made, be intended for a transliteration of K\u1e63ahar\u0101tasa or Chaharatas\u0101, the title which Nahap\u0101na usually bears on his coins; but a little correction would make it into \u03a4\u0391\u03a4\u039b\u03a0ACC, and this might very well represent a Graecized form zatlapasa\u00b9 = k\u1e63atr\u0101pasa or chatrapasa, a title which he bears in some of his inscriptions,\u00b2 and which, indeed, may possibly even have been used in the Indian legends on the reverse of this particular coin, for both the Brahmi and the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi inscriptions are too imperfect in the case of this word to admit of any certain reading.\n\nIn the case of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana, the obverse legend in Greek letters is plainer. The two coins which are clearest in this respect read:\n\n(1) . ANN[\u03a9]\u03a4\u0391 . . . . . . . . NCA [Bh.\n(2) . ANN[\u03a9]\u0399\u0391\u03a4[P] . . . . [CI]ACTANCA [Col. Biddulph.\n\nThis seems undoubtedly to be a transliteration of R\u0101j\u00f1o k\u1e63atr\u0101pasa Ca\u1e63\u1e6danasa. It must be noticed, however, that it does not correspond with the Indian (Br\u0101hm\u012b) inscription on the other side, which gives to Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana the higher title of Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa and calls him the son of Ghsamotika (v. inf., p. 370, Pl. 2). The silver coin attributed by Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l (p. 645) to Jayad\u0101man also has [-]\u039d\u039d\u0399\u03a9 quite distinct; but, as will be seen (inf., p. 372), it is extremely doubtful whether this coin should not rather be assigned to Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana ruling as K\u1e63atrapa. Generally it may be said that no attempt to explain as significant the inscriptions in Greek characters on coins subsequent to the time of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana has hitherto been successful; and that\n\n\u00b9 For the initial letter z, of the Greek transliteration of the word k\u1e63atr\u0101pasa on the coins of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana (inf., p. 370).

This trifling observation may not be without significance when it is coupled with the fact that a break occurs in the dynasty at this time, and that the reign of Rudrasimha, son of Sv\u0101mi Jivad\u0101man, marks a new departure. Such traces as are to be seen on later coins seem, however, to indicate a subsequent reversion to the old form.\n\nIt has been generally supposed that the K\u1e63atrapa coinage was derived, alike as regards its form and its standard of weight, from the later Graeco-Indian coinage, and that the origin of this obverse inscription in Greek characters is thus fully explained. This view must be, in the main, perfectly correct. There can be little doubt as to the general similarity between the K\u1e63atrapa coins and the hemidrachms of Apollodotus Philopator, for instance; but there are also, apparently, traces of other influence; and in some respects, notably in the arrangement of the inscription\u2014which is interrupted by the bust, not continuous all around the coin\u2014Roman denarii rather than Graeco-Indian hemidrachms seem to have served as the models from\n\n\\(^1\\) I must altogether retract an opinion expressed by me in a note to Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l's paper (p. 648) that \"It is scarcely too much to say that no identical or even very similar combinations of these Greek letters are to be found on different specimens.\" It was only after the systematic examination of many hundreds of specimens that it was seen that these fragments are, in most cases, parts of the same original.\nwhich the K\u1e63atrapa coinage was copied.\\footnote{Roman coins belonging to the period from Augustus to Antoninus Pius were, as we know, plentiful in India (to the references given in \\textit{Indian Coins}, \u00a7 14, add Hill, \\textit{Num. Chron.}, 1898, p. 304), and there are undoubted instances of Roman influence on Indian coinage\u2014e.g., in the bust on the small bronze coins of Kozola Kadaphes, and in the style of the figures of divinities represented on the gold coinage of the Ku\u1e63\u0101na monarchs Kan\u012b\u015bka and Huv\u012b\u015bka.} The letters of the obverse inscriptions of Nahap\u0101na and Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana are undoubtedly Greek, but, on the later coins, there seem often to be reminiscences of such commonly recurring Roman formulae as AVG, COSIII, etc. It is most probable, then, that the K\u1e63atrapa coins owe something to both Graeco-Indian and Roman sources.\n\n\\textbf{The Coin-Dates and their Representation.}\n\nMost important modifications in the dynastic list, as arranged by Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l, have resulted from the discovery of specimens bearing new dates. At the same time, scarcely less has been gained by a more precise and rigid method of dealing with the dated specimens already known. It is important to distinguish always between the certain and the probable. It is almost equally important to abstain from all conjecture as to mere possibilities. In these pages, therefore, a note of interrogation has been added to every reading of a date as to the absolute accuracy of which there can be the slightest shadow of a doubt, and this note of interrogation has been used only to denote what is in itself probable and apparently justified by traces remaining on the coin or other satisfactory evidence, never to denote what is possible but wholly conjectural. The letter \\( x \\) has been used to indicate a digit which is quite uncertain, and, where it is possible to assign limits to this uncertainty, these have been added within a bracket.\n\nWith regard to the reading of these dates, some ambiguity remains apparently on one point only\u2014the determination whether, in certain cases, the character which appears in the unit\u2019s place should be read as 8 or 9. There is no doubt about the normal forms of these numerals. They both occur in inscriptions in cases where the number is\nrepresented both in figures and words, e.g., eight = \u03b3, \u03c8, and \u03b3 (Arch. Surv. West. Ind.: Buddhist Cave Temples, pl. xlvi, Mahad, 1 and 2) and nine = \u1f11 (id., pl. lii, 18, from N\u0101sik). The doubt arises when we find on the coins forms which, by a little ingenuity, admit of explanation as either. Such a form is \u1f11, which is of frequent occurrence (e.g., B.M., Bh. Coll., No. 25). B\u00fchler assigns the value nine to this figure (Indische Palaeographie, Tafel ix), while Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l invariably reads it as eight. The coin from the Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l Collection just referred to is one of Rudrasimha, son of Rudrad\u0101man, and has the date \u1f11, and the earliest known date of his successor, Jivad\u0101man, son of D\u0101ma\u015bada, appears on a coin\u2014Bh. Coll., No. 20\u2014as \u1f11. There can be little doubt that the latter is 119, and if so the presumption is that the former is 118, i.e. that this \u1f11 = eight. The same rule works well if applied to other cases of possible doubt. For instance, on the coins of Vijayasena, son of D\u0101masena, we find both \u1f11 (Bh. Coll., Nos. 255, 256) and \u1f11 (id., No. 257, etc.). Now, the latter is almost certainly 169 (although the fact was overlooked by the Pandit), and, if so, the former is surely 168, as all the other unit-figures are perfectly well known. The hook at the top seems to be the chief characteristic of the nine: the short line at the top of the eight seems simply to be a m\u0101tra\u2014or what English printers call a serif\u2014such as was added to N\u0101gari letters generally at this period.\n\nThe Era of the Coin-Dates.\n\nThe vexed question of the origin of the \u015aaka era need not be discussed here. What we have to decide is whether the dates on these coins are more fittingly ascribed to it or to some other era. In Indian Coins, \u00a7 83, I point out that the assumption of another era, beginning about 100 A.D., is quite unnecessary, and that the known facts of the case well agree with the presumption that the dates are in the \u015aaka era, beginning 78 A.D. This view has since been confirmed by Professor Kielhorn's observations as to\nthe use of the word var\u1e63a (as opposed to samvat\u015bara) to denote 'year' in inscriptions. From an examination of all the known instances he concludes that \"the great preponderance of the word var\u1e63a in the technical language of the \u015aaka dates must, no doubt, be regarded as a distinguishing feature of the \u015aaka era.\" After referring to the dates on the inscriptions of the Western K\u1e63atrapas, he says \"the word for 'year' everywhere is var\u1e63a (or its Prakrit equivalent), and this circumstance seems to me to connect these dates in an unmistakable manner with the dates which are distinctly referred to the \u015aaka era, in which the word var\u1e63a decidedly predominates. In fact, the way in which var\u1e63a is used both in the dates of the Western K\u1e63atrapas and in the \u015aaka dates universally so called, tends, in my opinion, to support the views of those scholars who have assigned the former to the \u015aaka era, on historical grounds.\"\u00b9 This acute deduction appears to me to make practically certain what was before a very probable theory.\n\nGeneral Cunningham (Coins of Mediaeval India, p. 3) tentatively assigned the years found in Nahap\u0101na's inscriptions, 41, 42, and 46, to \"the era of the M\u0101lavas, beginning in B.C. 57.\" It is extremely improbable that Nahap\u0101na and Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana were separated by any such interval as would be necessitated by this theory; and Professor Kielhorn's rule would show that Nahap\u0101na's dates like those of the Western K\u1e63atrapas are in the \u015aaka era.\n\nThe Representation of the Eye in the Portraiture of Different Periods.\n\nThe types of the silver coinage remain the same from the beginning to the end of the dynasty\u2014from the reign of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana to that of Rudrasimha, son of Satyasimha\u2014a period of about two centuries and a half; but, in spite of this conservatism in regard to main features, which is characteristic of other Indian coinages also, slight variations are\n\n\u00b9 Ind. Ant., 1897, p. 153.\nnaturally to be observed in the art and workmanship of different periods. Some of these\u2014e.g., the different methods of representing the eye and lips in the portraits on the obverse, and the various forms assumed by the caitya, star and crescent, on the reverse\u2014were noticed by Newton in 1862,\\(^1\\) and it is interesting to observe (op. cit., table facing p. 26) how the results which he obtained from a minute examination of these details generally confirm the order of succession of these princes as determined by their inscriptions and dates.\n\nThese observations are often useful as criteria of date. The different methods adopted in the representation of the eye seem, in particular, to be determinable with great accuracy. The chief methods are shown in the accompanying sketches, which I owe to the kindness of Mr. Hill; and the period during which each one of these prevailed can be dated in most instances almost to the exact year.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{(1)} & \\text{Drawn from a coin of Mks.

Vijayasena, yr. 170: B.M., Bh.

As will be noticed (inf., p. 393), the dates on the coins of Vi\u015bvasi\u1e41ha and Bhartrd\u0101man are in such an unsatisfactory condition that it was, until quite recently, doubtful which of the two reigned first. The evidence from style is, in this case, important. Of the sixty-nine specimens of Vi\u015bvasi\u1e41ha's coinage in the British Museum, not one has a portrait with the eye formed according to the fashion prevalent during the latter part of Bhartrd\u0101man's reign\u2014a fact which, of itself, seems to show that Vi\u015bvasi\u1e41ha ruled before Bhartrd\u0101man.\n\n(6) Mks.

The only differences appear to be that the curve indicating the eye-ball is attached nearly to the end of the upper line of the eye, and that the lower line is shorter. The dates on most of Rudrasi\u1e41ha's coins are very indistinct, and it is impossible to date the introduction of this style very\naccurately. It certainly prevails after 230; but of the coins reading 22x, some follow this style and some that shown in Fig. 5.\n\n(7) K\u1e63.

This style seems to prevail until about the year 290, in the reign of Rudrasena, son of Rudrad\u0101man.\n\n(8) Mks. Rudrasena, son of Rudrad\u0101man, yr. 292: B.M., Bh. Coll., No. 67.\n\nIn this reign, after about the year 290, we seem to find a new style, in which the eye-brow is made much thicker, and the eye-ball represented by a circle at the end of the upper line, existing side by side with the style shown in Fig. 7. Both of these styles seem to occur together until the end of the dynasty, but the one described last and shown in Fig. 8 seems to predominate.\n\nThe Silver Coinage.\n\nNahap\u0101na, the K\u1e63ahar\u0101ta (Bh., p. 642).\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: dated inscription 41?, 42; Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated inscription 46.]\n\nObv.

Another noteworthy feature is its perfect Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscription in bold distinct characters.\n\n1 Thomas (Arch. Surv. West. Ind., K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101d and Kachh, p. 46 ff.) contended with much learning and ingenuity that the Greek title \u03a4\u03a5\u03a0\u0391\u039d\u039d\u039f\u03a5 was to be restored here. In J.R.A.S., 1881, p. 526, he suggested \u03a4\u03a5\u03a0\u0391\u039d\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u039d\u03a4\u039f\u03a3\u2014no doubt on the analogy of the coins of Mi\u0101us.\nThe Pandit's statement (on p. 641) that the title Chaharata used by Nahap\u0101na occurs also \"on the Taxila copper-plate dated in the seventy-eighth year of the great king Moga,\" must be accepted with some reservation. Hofrath Dr. G. B\u00fchler, in his edition of this copper-plate inscription (Epigraphia Indica, iv, p. 54 ff.), while admitting (p. 55, note 7) that the reading Chaharatasa was \"not absolutely impossible,\" preferred to read the passage as Chahara[sa] Cukhsasa ca Chatrapasa, and to interpret it as meaning that \"Liaka ruled as Satrap over the districts of Chahara and Cukhsa.\" It is, therefore, not yet satisfactorily proved that we know of any other ruler of the K\u1e63ahar\u0101ta family besides Nahap\u0101na. My account of the K\u1e63ahar\u0101tas, in Indian Coins, \u00a7 78, should be amended accordingly. The statement, moreover, that Nahap\u0101na is \"known as a \u015aaka from the inscriptions of his son-in-law U\u1e63avad\u0101ta\" should be qualified. The fact is merely that U\u1e63avad\u0101ta himself\u2014not Nahap\u0101na\u2014is, in all probability, but still not quite certainly, called a \u015aaka in one of the N\u0101sik inscriptions (Arch. Surv. West. Ind.: Buddhist Cave Temples, p. 101, note 3).\n\nThere can be no reasonable doubt that the K\u1e63ahar\u0101ta family is to be identified with the Khakhar\u0101ta family, which the Andhra king V\u0101sithiputa Pulum\u0101yi boasts of having destroyed, in the N\u0101sik inscription dated in the nineteenth year of his reign (id., p. 108). In another inscription the title appears as Khabar\u0101ta (id., p. 101, No. 6).\n\nNahap\u0101na is styled R\u0101ja K\u1e63ahar\u0101ta K\u1e63atrapa in an inscription dated in the year 42, and having a postscript in which the years 41 and 45 are mentioned (id., p. 102, No. 9); but he appears as [R\u0101ja] Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa Sv\u0101mi in an inscription of his minister Ayama dated in the year 46 (id., p. 103, No. 11). He seems to bear the higher title only on this inscription, and on no coin hitherto discovered. It is, perhaps, scarcely safe to conclude from this one piece of evidence, that, on the assumption of the higher title Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, he discontinued the use of his family-name K\u1e63ahar\u0101ta.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nGhsamotika.\n\nFrom the coins of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana we learn that he was the son of Ghsamotika. This would seem to be the Indian transliteration of some foreign\u2014probably Persian\u2014proper name; but until this point can be definitely decided, the alternative may be borne in mind that Ghsamotikaputra may possibly be some title formed on the analogy of r\u0101japutra, devaputra, and the like. If Ghsamotika be a proper name, it is somewhat strange that it is unaccompanied by any title whatsoever. All the genealogical tables given in the inscriptions begin with Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana, and no mention whatever is made in them of his father. This is to be explained, according to our adoption of one or other of the alternative suggestions just mentioned, as due to the fact either that the father was a private person without any titles, or that gheamotikaputra simply means \u2018son of the feudal lord,\u2019 \u2018knight,\u2019 \u2018esquire,\u2019 or something of the kind.\n\nIn Thomas\u2019s article on the \u201cEpoch of the Guptas,\u201d in the Journal for 1881, p. 524, he says: \u201cMr. Burgess informs me that a coin of the father of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana has lately been found. The name appears in its archaic form as \u1e2a\u0394\u039d, \u1e62yamotika.\u201d A very slight correction in this reading would, of course, give us Ghsamotika. Unfortunately, this interesting coin has disappeared. Dr. Burgess tells me that he distinctly remembers seeing it in the Pan\u1e0dit\u2019s collection, and being told that it came from K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101\u1e0d. The Pan\u1e0dit\u2019s collection is now in the British Museum, but all attempts to find this particular coin have been in vain.\n\nCa\u1e63\u1e6dana, son of Ghsamotika (Bh., p. 643).\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa and Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: no dated coins or inscriptions.]\n\n1 Obv.

Ind., iv, p. 56) that the true reading is Cuksa\u00b2 or possibly Cu\u1e63ka.\n\nAs the Pandit (Bh., p. 644) remarks, there are two types of reverse on Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana's coins:\u2014(1) a crescent and a star or rayed sun, and (2) the caitya accompanied by these symbols. This latter type is universal for the silver coinage from this time until the end of the dynasty. Of the former there appears to be no specimen in England, and none has been published anywhere.

The last syllable -sa on this coin is also very peculiar. Want of space is, perhaps, a sufficient explanation of these abnormal characters.\n\u00b2 Dowson's original reading, J.R.A.S., 1863, p. 221.\n\u00b3 There is no certain trace of a Kharosthi inscription. It is inferred on the analogy of other coins. There is certainly not room enough for the whole inscription. It may possibly have been Ra\u00f1o Ca\u1e63\u1e6danasa or even Ra\u00f1o Chatrapasa Ca\u1e63\u1e6danasa.\n\u2074 The actual name of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana does not occur on this coin, but there can scarcely have been another Ghsamotikaputra.\nwe learn that he reigned as K\u1e63atraka, while all the other coins and all the inscriptions in which he is mentioned give him the higher title of Mah\u0101k\u1e63atraka. In the inscriptions of his successors, he is universally regarded as the founder of the dynasty; but we have no dates on coins or inscriptions to aid us in determining the limits of his reign.\n\nThe other coin just mentioned as possibly attributable to Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana as K\u1e63atraka is assigned doubtfully by the Pandit (Bh., p. 645) to his son and successor, the K\u1e63atraka Jayad\u0101man. Its reverse inscriptions are\u2014\n\nR\u0101j\u00f1o K\u1e63atapasa [ . . . . . ] (Br\u0101hm\u012b):\nRa\u00f1o Cha [ . . . . . . . . ] (Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b).\n\nSo far as the epigraphy is concerned, the missing name may be restored as Ca\u1e63\u1e6danasa or as Jayad\u0101ma\u1e47i with equal probability.\n\nThere are, however, some points in favour of an attribution not only to Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana, but also to an early period of his career.\n\n(1) As the Pandit remarks (Bh., p. 645), \"The coin is in many respects like those of Nahap\u0101na; both style and letters are similar.\"\n\n(2) In these early coins there is a distinctly noticeable tendency to curtail the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscription. On the coins of Nahap\u0101na it is quite full and of equal importance with the inscription in Br\u0101hm\u012b characters. On the coins of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana, as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atraka, on the other hand, the bare name, without any titles whatever, appears in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b transliteration. If we are to assign the coin in question to Jayad\u0101man, we must suppose that the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, after a period of decline, had again risen into importance. It is more reasonable, surely, to assume that the gradual disuse of the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscription finds its explanation in changed conditions of time or place, and that, after the time of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana, the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b inscription, if it occurred at all, might be expected to contain merely the name, without any of the titles.\nOF SUR\u0100STRA AND M\u0100LAVA.\n\n(3) The portrait is certainly not unlike those on the undoubted coins of Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana.\n\nFor these reasons we shall probably be justified in transferring the coin to Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana, and in supposing that, as K\u1e63atrapa, he issued silver coins of both his reverse types.\n\nJAYAD\u0100MAN, SON OF CASTANA (Bh., p. 645).\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: no dated coins or inscriptions.]\n\nA most interesting coin was published by the late General Sir A. Cunningham in his Coins of Mediaeval India, p. 6, pl. i, 7, and attributed to Jayad\u0101man. This attribution cannot, unfortunately, be regarded as quite certain until the reading of the name is confirmed by further specimens; but it is, in itself, not improbable, and, if it can be proved, it will supply an important link between the coins of Ujjain\u00b9 and the K\u1e63atrapa coinage.\n\nGeneral Cunningham's description of his coin requires correction. It should be\u2014\n\nObv. Elephant to right: [.]yada(?)ma(?)[.].\n\nRev.

'65, wt. 30.\n\nNo adequate explanation has yet been given of the second part of this name. We seem to have here an undoubted instance of a hybrid formation. The first part is Sanskrit and the second apparently Persian. Is it possible that -p\u0101nasa or -p\u0101sa is simply the Persian noun \"son\"? There are three princes bearing this name, and this explanation would give a satisfactory meaning in two cases out of the three\u2014i.e., Rudrad\u0101ma and D\u0101maghsada\u2014but not in the case\u2014D\u0101majada\u015b\u012bya\u2014of Rudrad\u0101ma\u2014unless any such a word had once existed there. Therefore, although it seems very likely that we should be justified in accepting Persian words as a part of K\u1e63atrapa dynasties\u2014particularly for the D\u0101maghsada\u2014this is merely a Persian word.\n\nIt can be seen that the name agrees with the original, so long as it is not necessary to make it easy to understand. It is also possible that the name was originally D\u0101maghsada, but that the letters were changed by some unknown force.\nRudrasimha, son of Rudrad\u0101man (Bh., p. 650).\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: coin dated 102 and inscription dated 103.

When Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l wrote he was generally known to have ruled as a K\u1e63atrapa on the evidence of an inscription only.\u00b2 This evidence is now supplemented by a coin in the Cunningham Collection, dated 102, the obverse inscription of which has been referred to above (p. 361). The reverse inscription is\u2014\n\nR\u0101j\u00f1o Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapasa Rudrad\u0101maputra[sa] R\u0101j\u00f1[o]\nK\u1e63atra[pasa] Rudras[i]hasa.\u00b3\n\nIn the following year, 103, Rudrasimha appears as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, and retains this title on all the coins dated between this year and 110. Of those dated 110 some bear the title Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa and some the title K\u1e63atrapa. For some cause or other, then, Rudrasimha abandons the superior and assumes the inferior title within the year 110. None of his coins in our collections seems to be dated 111, but he retains the title of K\u1e63atrapa on all the coins as yet found.\n\n\u00b9 For the facts see the following paragraph on Jivad\u0101man, son of D\u0101majada.\n\u00b2 The date of this inscription is 103 as stated in BA. There is no doubt on the subject, as the date is given both in words and figures. The reading on the facsimile of this inscription, given in Bh\u0101rnagar Inscriptions, pl. xvii, is undoubtedly [ra]r\u015b triuttara:ate = 103. B\u00fchler, however, read dryuttara:ate = 102. His statement (Ind. Ant., x, p. 157) that the date (102) is no new one, as it occurs on the coins, was no doubt the result of his own observation; but it appears not to have been published. The Rev. H. R. Scott tells me that a coin in the Watson Museum at Rajkot appears to be dated 102.\n\u00b3 Rudrasimha seems to be the regular form of the name on the coins, though the vowel i is not always visible. The same form is found in inscriptions, cf. B\u00fchler, Ind. Ant., x (1881), p. 157.\nbearing the date 112. He appears again as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa on all the coins as yet found bearing the date 113, and keeps this title until the year 118, which is the last year of his reign appearing on the coinage.\n\nThese facts in the history of Rudrasimha are of great interest, in so far as they add to the data which we already have for determining the relations which existed between the offices of Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa and K\u1e63atrapa within this dynasty, and perhaps between this dynasty and some other power claiming and sometimes exercising a sort of suzerainty over it. At a later period it seems probable both that the dynasty was independent and that the title K\u1e63atrapa was given\u2014as will be seen from Colonel Biddulph's table (inf., p. 407), not regularly, but frequently\u2014to the heir-apparent, who became Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa in due course on the death of the sovereign. But it is doubtful whether such was the case originally. Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l assumes throughout that these princes were at first feudatories of some greater power. There seem to be certain indications that this was the fact, but it can scarcely be said to be proved, and some of Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l's historical deductions cannot be maintained. The whole question of the history of Nahap\u0101na and Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana, their relation to each other, and the relation of both to the Andhra power, requires careful re-examination in the light of the available inscriptions. Too much has hitherto been taken for granted. It must suffice here to state the facts which are known as to the use of the titles K\u1e63atrapa and Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa by the earlier members of the dynasty:\u2014(1) Nahap\u0101na and Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana bear both titles, proceeding from the lower to the higher; (2) Jayad\u0101man is K\u1e63atrapa only; (3) Rudrad\u0101man is Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa only, and boasts in his great inscription of having won this title for himself; (4) Rudrasimha proceeds from K\u1e63atrapa to Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, then for between two and three years uses the title K\u1e63atrapa only, and eventually resumes the title Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa. From all this it seems very probable that these princes originally won the higher title for themselves, as Rudrad\u0101man boasts of doing, and were forced to take the lower when their\npower suffered a temporary eclipse. We know from the inscriptions that Nahap\u0101na and Rudrad\u0101man came into conflict with the Andhras, and it is extremely probable that this feud was carried on, according to the Indian fashion, almost year by year with varying fortune. The title Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa may possibly have depended on this fortune, and may perhaps originally have been attached to some particular province wrested from the Andhras. This suggestion is put forward merely as possible, and as apparently not contradicted by anything we know.\n\nThe probable Persian character of the earlier names occurring in this dynasty has been referred to above (p. 374). Can it be that these princes are to be identified with the Pahlavas of the inscriptions? It is doubtful if we have sufficient evidence on which to decide this question; but indications in favour of the identification are as follows: (1) The work commemorated in the inscription of Rudrad\u0101man was executed by the \"Pahlava minister Suvis\u0101kha, the son of Kulaipa\" (Arch. Surv. West. Ind.: Kathiaw\u0101d and Kachh, p. 130); (2) the Andhra king Vasi\u1e6dhiputa Pulum\u0101yi boasts that he \"humbled the pride and arrogance of the K\u1e63atriyas . . . destroyed the \u015aakas, Yavanas, and Pahlavas . . . entirely destroyed the Khakhara\u1e47a race . . . restored the fame of the S\u0101tav\u0101hana race\" (id., Buddhist Cave Temples, p. 109). Some sort of explanation can be given of all the other names here mentioned; and this makes it not improbable that the remaining name, Pahlavas, is here used to designate the K\u1e63atrapa power, with which the Andhras are known to have been sometimes at feud.\n\nIn the reverse type of the K\u1e63atrapa coins, the star or rayed sun almost invariably appears to the right of the caitya and the crescent to the left. On the available coins issued by Rudrasimha in the year 110, after the diminution of his power described above, this order is reversed. Whether this fact is merely curious, or whether it has some\n\n---\n\n1 Two in the B.M.: Cunningham, 94, 5-7, 679; and Bh., 91.\nsignificance, it is difficult to say.\\footnote{So far as has been noticed, only one other instance is known, on a coin of Mks. Sv\u0101mi Rudrasena, son of Mks. Sv\u0101mi Rudrad\u0101man, published by Newton in the \\textit{Journ. Bomb. Br. R.A.S.}, 1862, p. 9, fig. 9.} No coins bearing the date 111 have yet been published, but on those dated 112, while Rudrasimha still bears the title of K\u1e63atrapa, we find a reversion to the usual arrangement\u2014star to right and crescent to left.\n\n\\textbf{Jivad\u0101man, son of D\u0101majada (Bh., p. 649).}\n\n[Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 119, 120.]\n\nThe Pandit's statement that the only date found on the coins of Jivad\u0101man is 100, needs correction. An examination of the four dated specimens now in the British Museum gives the following results:\n\n(1) Bh., 18, dated lxx. Only traces of the 100 figure are now visible; but there is nothing to show that a decimal and a unit figure were not also intended.\n\n(2) Bh., 17, dated lx. The decimal figure 10 can be restored with certainty. The tail of the unit figure can be seen, so that it must have been undoubtedly one of the figures from 4 to 9. As Jivad\u0101man's predecessor was ruling in 118, the date on this coin may be restored as either 118 or 119.\n\n(3) Bh., 20, dated 119. There can be no doubt about this date. The reverse of the coin has been double struck, so that the designation D\u0101majudasa putrasa appears twice, while the name Jirad\u0101masa is altogether absent. It is just possible, therefore, that this coin may belong to Satyad\u0101man, the other known son of this D\u0101majada. This is, however, extremely improbable, because of (1) the date, and (2) the fact that Satyad\u0101man's coin-legend is in pure Sanskrit.\n\n(4) Cunn., 94, 5\u20137, 676, dated 120.

'6, wt. 29 grs.; Pl. 4.\n\nThis most interesting and important coin was brought to me by Colonel Biddulph in April 1897. It reveals to us a member of this dynasty of whom no other record has yet come to light. Unfortunately, there are traces only of the hundred figure in the date on his coin, and we are, therefore, unable to determine his position with absolute certainty. There is nothing to show definitely whether he was the elder or the younger son of D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b, and, as will be seen from Colonel Biddulph's table of Mah\u0101k\u1e63atr\u0101pas and K\u1e63atr\u0101pas (inf., p. 407), there are several gaps in the line of K\u1e63atr\u0101pas which might quite possibly have been filled by him. With our present data, the easiest solution of the problem seems to be to suppose that he was the younger son of D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b, and that he was K\u1e63atra at the time when his elder brother Jivad\u0101man was Mah\u0101k\u1e63atra, i.e. during the years 119 and 120. This position may be provisionally assigned to him for the present; but of course it must be borne in mind that future discoveries may quite possibly show that he was K\u1e63atra at some time during the two periods 103\u2013110 and 113\u2013118, when his uncle Rudrasimha reigned as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atra, or even earlier still during the reign of his father D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b.\n\nSatyad\u0101man's coin-legend forms an exception to the general rule. It is written in Sanskrit, whereas all the others are written in Prakrit. All its genitive forms, for instance, are quite regular. The sandhi in R\u0101j\u00f1o K\u1e63a\u2014found also in inscriptions, cf. Hoernl\u00e9, Ind. Ant., xii (1883), p. 32\u2014is the only point in which it at all varies from the ordinary usage of Sanskrit.\nRudrasena, son of Rudrasimha (Bh., p. 652).\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 121; Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated inscription 122?, dated coins 125\u2013144.]\n\nFor our knowledge that Rudrasena held the position of K\u1e63atrapa we are again indebted to Colonel Biddulph, who first called attention to the following coin in his collection:\n\nObv. Date 121; remains of inscription in Greek characters.\n\nRev. Raj\u00f1o Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapasa Rudras[i]hasa putrasa Raj\u00f1o K\u1e63atrapasa Rudrasenasa.\n\nColonel Biddulph. *6, wt. 32\u00b75 grs.; Pl. 5.\n\nThere are now two other specimens in the British Museum on which Rudrasena appears as K\u1e63atrapa. The date of one of these\u2014Cunn., 94, 5\u20137, 680\u2014seems undoubtedly to be 121. On the other\u2014Bird, 54, 5\u201329, 18\u2014the unit figure is indistinct. On one of Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l\u2019s coins, No. 109, the date is apparently, though still not quite certainly, 122; but the inscription is incomplete, and it is impossible to say whether it is a coin of Rudrasena as K\u1e63atrapa or Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa.\n\nIt may be inferred from what the Pandit says about a stone slab bearing an inscription of Rudrasena that he was reigning in 122 as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa. A further examination of this inscription is much to be desired. The two points on which more precise information is required are\u2014(1) Is the date undoubtedly 122? and (2) is Rudrasena undoubtedly called Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa? Regarding this inscription, Dr. Burgess most kindly wrote to me as follows:\u2014\n\n\"The Mahasur inscription (I think the J.R.A.S. spelling is wrong) was either the first or second K\u1e63atrapa inscription I got a copy of\u2014how long ago I cannot remember; but it was on thin calico\u2014a tracing made by some political or police officer who had come across it in Okhamundal. I gave the tracing to General Cunningham in 1870 and heard no more of it. But before leaving Bombay in 1889,\"\nI saw the stone in the lobby at the foot of the stairs of the Bombay Asiatic Society's Library. It is very much weather-worn, and would hardly yield an estampage or any other sort of copy: the reading of it is difficult, as the large letters have got worn to mere irregular depressions. . . . Mulv\u0101sar is on the Gulf of Kachh, W.N.W. from Dv\u0101raka, if my memory serves me.\" It is to be hoped that the letters are still sufficiently clear to enable some scholar who has access to the original to determine the date and title. It is important to verify the Pandit's statements as given in the Journal for 1890, as this article was compiled by me from his rough notes, and it is quite possible that I may sometimes have been mistaken in my representation of his views.\n\nAn inscription, published in Bh\u0101vnagar Inscriptions, p. 23, pl. xix, is attributed to the time of a Mks. Rudrasena, and the date read as 232. This reading is certainly not correct. The decimal figure seems undoubtedly to be 20. The question remains whether the hundreds' figure may not possibly be 100. From the facsimile, which is, unfortunately, not a very good one, this numeral seems at first sight to be 200; but, on closer examination, it will be seen that the short line attached to the right, which appears on the facsimile, may well be due either to a flaw in the stone or to some imperfection in the squeeze. A similar line, undoubtedly a flaw, is seen to be attached to several other characters in this inscription\u2014e.g. to the numeral 20 in the date. The difficulties in the way of accepting a date 222 for another Rudrasena are so considerable, that on the whole it seems extremely probable that the correct date of this inscription is 122. If so, this date must be added to our list of Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapas.\n\nColonel Biddulph has pointed out to me that Sir E. Clive Bayley, in his article \"On the Genealogy of Modern Numerals\" (J.R.A.S., 1882, p. 373), assigns a date 122 to Rudrasena, son of Rudrasimha, but gives no information as to whether he bears the title K\u1e63atraka or Mah\u0101k\u1e63atraka on the coin in question.\nThe coins dated 125 are still the earliest on which Rudrasena is known with certainty to appear as Mah\u0101ksatraka. A coin in the British Museum, Bh. Coll., No. 29, has the date 144 or 146. The dates of Sa\u1e45ghad\u0101man and D\u0101masena show that the former must be the correct reading.\n\nSa\u1e45ghad\u0101man, son of Rudrasimha (Bh., p. 652).\n\n[? K\u1e63atrapa; Mah\u0101ksatraka: dated coin 144.]\n\nAccording to Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l, \u201con a coin belonging to the Naeb Dewan of Bhaunagar, Sa\u1e45ghad\u0101man bears the title of K\u1e63atrapa.\u201d Now, curiously enough, the inscription on the coins of Sa\u1e45ghad\u0101man is very liable, in the case of imperfect specimens, to be mistaken for that of the K\u1e63atrapa Ya\u015bod\u0101man, son of the Mah\u0101ksatraka Rudrasimha, who lived nearly a hundred years later. A minute examination of the lettering would, indeed, in all cases, dispel any doubt as to the correct attribution, even if the syllables composing Sa\u1e45gha- or Ya\u015bo- were not clear; but only those who have had much to do with these coins can realize how very easy it is to confuse the two. As instances in point, it may be mentioned that we originally attributed one of Colonel Biddulph\u2019s specimens to a K\u1e63atrapa Sa\u1e45ghad\u0101man, and that a similar mistake was made in arranging the series in the British Museum. Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l may possibly have fallen into a similar error. In the absence of positive proof one way or the other, it will be safest for the present to add a note of interrogation to Sa\u1e45ghad\u0101man\u2019s name in the list of K\u1e63atrapas.\n\nNo query need be added to the date 144 as the reading of the coin on which he appears as Mah\u0101ksatraka, although, as Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l remarks, the unit figure is somewhat indistinct. The fact is that traces of a cross line show that the unit figure must either have been a 4 or a 6. The date can scarcely have been 146, as D\u0101masena began his reign as Mah\u0101ksatraka in 145 (v. inf.). There can, therefore, be practically no doubt whatever that the unit figure on Sa\u1e45ghad\u0101man\u2019s coin must be restored as a 4.\nPRATHIVISENA, SON OF RUDRASENA (Bh., p. 653).\n\n[K\u1e63atraka: dated coins 144.]\n\nThe Pandit believed his specimen to be unique, but Colonel Biddulph has since acquired another specimen.\n\nObv.

He probably regarded the curve to the right, which is characteristic of the figure 5, as a fragment of the usual inscription in Greek characters. On careful examination, however, this curve is seen to be connected with the other part of the numeral, and the whole constitutes a 5 of quite normal character. The limits of D\u0101masena's reign as given by the coins should, therefore, be corrected as above.\n\nDAMAJADASRI, SON OF RUDRASENA (Bh., p. 654).\n\n[K\u1e63atraka: dated coins 154, 155.]\n\nSir E. Clive Bayley (J.R.A.S., 1882, p. 374) gives 155 as the date of one of his coins of this K\u1e63atraka.

This date should, therefore, be added to the one previously known.\n\nIt may be worth while to state that, on incomplete or badly preserved specimens, there is considerable risk of confusion between this K\u1e63atrapa D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b, son of the Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa Rudrasena, and the Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b, son of the Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa D\u0101masena, who ruled later (v. inf., p. 389). Our K\u1e63atrapa has accordingly, in consequence of this confusion, been supposed to have reigned also as a Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa. There is, however, as yet no really good specimen to prove this. The probability is that he does not occur as a Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa on the coinage.\n\n\u012a\u015bvaradatta (Bh., p. 656).\n\n[Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coins \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018second\u2019 year.]\n\nThat this monarch belonged to the \u0100bhira tribe, as conjectured by Bhagy\u0101nl\u0101l, is extremely probable. The causes which led to his intrusion into this dynasty are still as mysterious as ever. All that is certain is that the period hitherto assigned to him can now no longer be supported. As will be seen from our discussion of the coins of D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b, son of D\u0101masena (inf., p. 390), the gap which was formerly supposed to exist between the reigns of the Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapas Vijayasena and D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b\u2014from 171 to 176\u2014has been shown by newly-discovered coin-dates not to exist. \u012a\u015bvaradatta can, therefore, no longer find a place here.\n\nAll that we know of him directly from his coins is that he reigned as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa for two years. The reverse inscriptions are dated in words either as \u201cin the first year\u201d or \u201cin the second year\u201d; and it is almost certain that the discovery of more complete specimens will show that these dates are repeated in numerals in the usual place on the obverse. Two coins in the British Museum, Bh. Coll., Nos. 708 and 46, seem to show distinct traces of the numerals \u2014 and = respectively.\nFrom a glance at the dated list of Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapas it will be seen that there are several gaps in the chronology as at present fixed by the coins and inscriptions. It remains to ascertain what evidence there is in favour of any one of these possible dates for \u012a\u015bvaradatta.\n\nAt first sight the most tempting view is that the degradation in rank of Rudrasimha, son of Rudrad\u0101man, during the period from the year 110 to the year 112 was due to the rise of this Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa; but, as will be seen, this view cannot be maintained. Other gaps which might possibly have been partly filled by \u012a\u015bvaradatta's reign are between Jivad\u0101man, son of D\u0101majada, and Rudrasena, son of Rudrasimha\u2014120 to 125;\u00b9 and between D\u0101masena, son of Rudrasimha, and his son Ya\u015bod\u0101man\u2014157 to 161. The gaps which occur after the decline in the style of the coinage which sets in towards the end of the reign of Vijayasena (v. inf., p. 389) need not be considered, as it is quite certain that the coins of \u012a\u015bvaradatta show no signs of this decline, and are, therefore, earlier than the latter part of the reign of Vijayasena (162?\u2013172?).\n\nThe evidence derived from considerations of portraiture and epigraphy is as follows:\n\n(1) The treatment of the eye on the coins of \u012a\u015bvaradatta is such as we have seen to prevail during the period from about the year 127 in the reign of Rudrasena, son of Rudrasimha, as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, to about the year 170 in the reign of Vijayasena, son of D\u0101masena (v. sup., p. 367, fig. 3).\n\n(2) Bhagv\u0101nlal supposed (Bh., p. 656) that the bust on the obverse of \u012a\u015bvaradatta's coins was imitated sometimes from that of V\u012brad\u0101man (K\u1e63atrapa, 156\u2013160), and sometimes from that of Vijayasena (K\u1e63atrapa and Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, 160\u2013172?). Newton also notices the general resemblance in portraiture and epigraphy between the coins of \u012a\u015bvaradatta and Vijayasena\u2014\"The coins of \u012a\u015bvara Datta bear a striking resemblance to those of Vijaya S\u0101h (r. Vijayasena); some apparent differences in the character of the legends being accounted for by the circumstance that on \u012a\u015bvara Datta's\n\n\u00b9 It is extremely doubtful, however, whether such a gap exists (v. sup., p. 380).\ncoins the difficulty is to extend the legend over the space allotted to it; but on Vijaya S\u0101h\u2019s to compress it within that space. I do not doubt that the reigns of the two kings were not separated by any long interval.\u201d\n\nThe degree of resemblance between the different portraits of these three\u2014or four, if we add another ruler of the period, Yasod\u0101man (K\u1e63atrapa, 160; Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, 161)\u2014is no doubt to a great extent a matter of opinion. What remains certain is that these four portraits have in common a likeness, which distinguishes them from those of rulers whom we know to have been earlier or later in date.\n\n(3) In judging of the date of K\u1e63atrapa coins from their epigraphy, three characters\u2014k\u1e63a, pa, and ha\u2014are especially serviceable for comparison, both because their different changes in form can be dated with a fair amount of accuracy, and because they all appear on every complete specimen. The change from one form of ha to the other\u2014from \u1e5a to \u1e62\u2014comes in very early,\u00b2 and does not concern us here.\n\nThe form of k\u1e63a occurring on \u012a\u015bvaradatta\u2019s coins is \u1e0d, with a very distinct sharp curve at the bottom. This form seems to come into use during the reign of Rudrasena, son of Rudrasimha, but probably not until after the year 130\u2014it does not occur on his coins as K\u1e63atrapa (121) and apparently not on the earlier coins (125\u2013130) struck by him as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa. It is very distinct on the coins of P\u1e5bthvisena (144), D\u0101masena (145\u2013157), V\u012brad\u0101man (K\u1e63atrapa, 156\u2013160), and Vijayasena (160\u2013172?). After this date the curve tends to become more rounded, but the sharp curve does not disappear entirely until after the reign of Bhart\u1e5bd\u0101man (2xx\u2013214). The evidence of this letter, therefore, only helps us to determine the earliest possible limit for \u012a\u015bvaradatta\u2019s reign. He can scarcely have come between Jivad\u0101man and Rudrasena, even if they were separated by an interval (120\u2013125).\n\n\u00b9 Journ. Bomb. Br. R.A.S., 1862, p. 9.\n\u00b2 Generally after the time of C\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dana; but the earlier form still appears occasionally on coins of a later date (inf., p. 397).\nThe letter pa on \u012a\u015bvaradatta's coins is distinctly rounded at the bottom, like a capital U; at a later period it becomes quite angular, like a V; and it is possible on the coinage to trace the transition between the two forms. There seems to be no instance of the pointed form before about the year 159. On the coins of Virad\u0101man (K\u1e63atrapa, 156\u2013160) the rounded form is by far the more common, and wherever the date can be read it seems to be either 159 or 160 on the specimens on which the pointed form appears. Ya\u015bod\u0101man's coins (160 and 161) have both, and so have the earlier coins of Vijayasena; but the 'rounded' form at this period so nearly approaches the angular that it is not always easy to distinguish between them. There can be little doubt, however, about the very definitely rounded form which occurs on the coins of \u012a\u015bvaradatta. It almost certainly signifies that his date is before the year 160.\n\nIt will be seen then that the evidence derived from broad features of resemblance and from minute details of portraiture and epigraphy alike points to the same conclusion\u2014that the most probable position of \u012a\u015bvaradatta is between D\u0101masena and Ya\u015bod\u0101man (157\u2013161), and that he was Mah\u0101k\u1e63atraka while Virad\u0101man was K\u1e63atraka.\n\nVirad\u0101man, son of D\u0101masena (Bh., p. 654).\n\n[K\u1e63atraka: dated coins 156\u2013160.]\n\nHere again a revision of the readings of specimens previously known necessitates a considerable change in the chronology. The coin, of which Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l read the date doubtfully as 176, is unquestionably dated 156. The limits of Virad\u0101man's career as K\u1e63atraka are, therefore, according to the coins, 156 and 160. This emendation simplifies matters greatly. The suggested date 176, which can now no longer be upheld, was a fruitful cause of difficulty. Since both Ya\u015bod\u0101man and Vijayasena appear as K\u1e63atrakas in the year 160, we were driven to the supposition either that Virad\u0101man, after being deposed, had regained his\nposition, or else that there were two or more K\u1e63atrapas reigning at the same time (Bh., p. 655). To the same source we may trace the assumption (Bh., p. 657), that while the interloper \u012a\u015bvaradatta had usurped the position of Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, \u201cthe K\u1e63atrapa Vi\u015bad\u0101man remained unmolested all through this period (i.e. 171, 172), as testified by the dates on his coins.\u201d Apart from this conjectural date, the coins testify to nothing of the kind.\n\n**Ya\u015bod\u0101man, son of D\u0101masena (Bh., p. 655).**\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 160; Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 161.]\n\nThe Pandit\u2019s account requires slight correction. There are eight coins of this Ya\u015bod\u0101man in his collection\u2014five as K\u1e63atrapa and three as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa.\n\n**Vijayasena, son of D\u0101masena (Bh., p. 655).**\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 160; Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 162?, 163\u2013171, 172?]\n\nAs we have just seen, the hypothesis that \u201cVi\u015bad\u0101man, Ya\u015bod\u0101man, and Vijayasena, sons of D\u0101masena, were all K\u1e63atrapas\u2014probably governors of provinces\u2014at the same time,\u201d is now no longer necessary. They all strike coins as K\u1e63atrapas in the same year, 160, but there is no reason whatever for supposing that they did not hold that office successively.\n\nBhagv\u0101nl\u0101l gives the dates as\u2014K\u1e63atrapa, 160\u2013162; Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, 163\u2013171. But there is some doubt on the subject. On the coins available for examination, the only certain date borne by coins struck by Vijayasena as K\u1e63atrapa is 160. The dates 161 and 162 are merely possible on some incomplete specimens. On the other hand, a coin struck by Vijayasena as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa has the remains of a date which can scarcely have been 163, but may quite possibly have been 162. It is the custom in Vijayasena\u2019s time to arrange the three short strokes, which represent\nthe numeral 3, in a vertical line, thus $\\equiv$; and the numerous good specimens with the date 163 give ample evidence of the space usually occupied by these strokes. On the coin in question there seems not to be space enough for all three, but there is certainly sufficient to admit of the two lower ones, if the date had been 163. On the other hand, there is probably not sufficient space to show the upper of the two strokes which would have denoted 2, $\\equiv$; while the stroke still visible seems to be too low down to have been intended for 1, the stroke for which seems regularly to occupy the midway position. It is not improbable, then, that this coin affords us evidence of the fact that Vijayasena was reigning as Mahak\u1e63atrapa in the year 162.\n\nFor similar reasons it is probable that the date 172 should be restored on another coin, Bh. Coll., No. 206.\n\nThe P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dit remarks that \"all the years from 160 to 171 inclusive are represented with the single exception of 169.\" If the view propounded above (p. 363) as to the representation of 8 and 9, is to be accepted, viz., that $\\chi = 8$, and $\\gamma = 9$, we may say that, with the doubtful exception of 161, every year between these two limits seems to be represented.\n\nSo far as concerns workmanship and distinctness in the representation of inscriptions and dates, the coins of Vijayasena are the most satisfactory in the whole series. But already in his reign, about the year 167 or 168, we note the beginning of a gradual degeneration in style, which continued until the end of the dynasty.\n\nD\u0101majada\u015br\u012b, son of D\u0101masena (Bh., p. 658).\n\n[Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 172 (or 3?)\u2013176.]\n\nOn the chronology of this Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, some additional light has been thrown by General Cunningham's coins. Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l only reads one date, 176, on his coins, and this remains the extreme limit assignable to his reign from\nBut the new coins undoubtedly prove that the reign began earlier than has been hitherto supposed. The date on Cunn., 94, 5-7, 702, is certainly to be restored as either 172 or 173. Here again, as in the precisely similar case of a coin of Vijayasena discussed above, the balance of probability is in favour of 172\u2014the solitary stroke visible seems to be too low down to be intended for 1, and the space above it too great to admit of its being the lowest stroke of a 3.\n\nWith regard to other dates of this D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b\u2014175 is certain on five of General Cunningham's coins, and 174 is possible as an alternative to 176 on one of Pandit Bhagv\u0101nlal's own specimens, No. 365.\n\nThe probability, therefore, is that this Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b, son of the Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa D\u0101masena, began his reign as early as the year 172; and, as we have seen, his predecessor and brother Vijayasena was reigning in 171. The Pandit had supposed an interval of five years (171-176) to have elapsed between these two reigns, and this was the chief reason for placing the usurper \u012a\u015bvaradatta here (Bh., p. 660). Another reason was derived from considerations of style and fabric. The Pandit saw a great difference in these respects between the coins of the two reigns; and it must be confessed that the contrast between the best coins of Vijayasena and the ordinary coins of D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b is sufficiently striking. But, as we have seen, the process of degeneration had already begun during Vijayasena's reign, and the difference in point of art between his later coins and those of his successor is so slight as to be scarcely appreciable.\n\nThe question of the probable position of \u012a\u015bvaradatta is discussed elsewhere (p. 384).\n\n---\n\n1 The Rev. H. R. Scott says: \"We have a coin of D\u0101masena's son D\u0101majada\u015br\u012b which appears to be dated 173, in which case the gap mentioned by the Pandit would be filled up and no room left for \u012a\u015bvaradatta between Vijayasena and this king.\"\nRudrasena, son of Virad\u0101man (Bh., p. 658).\n[Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 17x (6\u20139)\u2014194.]\n\nBoth of the limits of this reign (180\u2013190) as given by Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l must be corrected in accordance with coins in the collection of Colonel Biddulph.\n\nObv.

Another of Colonel Biddulph's specimens affords the date 19x, probably = 191.\n\nAccording to the Rev. H. R. Scott, there is a coin of Virad\u0101man in the Rajkot Museum dated 196 (or 194) and another 192. If the date 196 can be proved, it will, of course, necessitate the extension of the reign by two years; but it must be remembered that 6 and 4 are very easily mistaken on these coins.\n\nVi\u015bvasimha, son of Rudrasena (Bh., p. 658).\n[K\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 19x, 199, 200, 2[xx]; Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: no legible dates.]\n\nThe dates on the coins of this prince and his brother Bhartr\u0101dam\u0101na are in a most unsatisfactory state. Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l gives the limits of Vi\u015bvasimha's dated coinage as 198 and 203. It is quite possible that the unit figure, of which traces are to be seen on many specimens, may have been an 8; but it seems to me that the only certain unit of all\nthe coins dated 19x is undoubtedly a 9. The Pandit's reading is perhaps due to the confusion which has so often been made between these two numerals (v. sup., p. 363). On the other hand, I cannot think that his reading 203 can be absolutely proved for any of his specimens in the British Museum. There are numerous specimens in which the figure 200 is probably followed by another, but what that other is, is quite uncertain.\n\nOur knowledge of the fact that Vi\u015bvasimha also reigned as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa is again the result of Colonel Biddulph's investigations. He possesses four specimens on which Vi\u015bvasimha bears this title\u2014in the case of three of them quite certainly, in the case of the fourth most probably.\n\nObv. Date illegible.\nRev. R\u0101j\u00f1o Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapasa Rudrasenaputrasa R\u0101j\u00f1o Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapasa Vi\u015bvasimha.\nColonel Biddulph. \u00b755, wt. 31 grs.; Pl. 9.\n\nThe British Museum also possesses two specimens\u2014one (Bh., 502) quite certain, and the other (Bh., 468) more or less doubtful. Unfortunately not one of these coins has a legible date.\n\nAs has been already remarked (p. 375) -simha regularly appears as -siha on the coins. It may be added that most frequently no distinction is made between the i of Vi\u015bva- and the i of -siha. On the greater number of specimens (cf. Bh., Nos. 54, 461, 481, 498, 501) the name appears as Vi\u015bvasiha; but the proper distinction is sometimes made between the two vowels (e.g. on Bh., No. 515).\n\nThe coin, dated 198 (recte 199), to which the Pandit refers as reading R\u0101j\u00f1ah K\u1e63atrapasa (sic) Rudrasenaputrasa, etc., is probably his specimen, No. 53. It would indeed be remarkable if this reading could be proved. Rudrasena, as we know from his own coins, was certainly Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa from 17x to 194, and it would be passing strange to find his son describing him afterwards, in 199, as a K\u1e63atrapa. The reading cannot, however, be supported; and it is quite\neasy to explain how the Pandit fell into this mistake. The letters Mah\u0101- certainly do not appear on the coin, since, in consequence of the manner of striking, only portions of those letters can be seen which reach beneath the line. There is, however, ample space for them, and there is no reason whatever to doubt that the reading is Raj\u00f1o Mah\u0101- K\u1e63atrapasa. On the coins of Vi\u015bvasimha the correct sandhi is preserved in the writing of his own title Raj\u00f1ah K\u1e63atrapasa; and the Pandit was probably confirmed in his reading by two of the cluster of dots which occur on this portion of the coin, and might easily be mistaken for the visarga (\u1e25).\n\nHitherto, some doubt has been possible as to the order of succession of Vi\u015bvasimha and his brother Bhartrd\u0101man. Indeed, it has seemed most probable that Bhartrd\u0101man was the earlier. But the dates, incomplete as they are, seem to prove, so far as they can be certainly deciphered, that the opposite was the case. The evidence in favour of this order is supported, in a very curious and interesting manner, by an argument derived from the treatment of the eye in the portraiture of K\u1e63atrapa coins (v. sup., p. 367).\n\nBhartrd\u0101man, son of Rudrasena (Bh., p. 658).\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 2(xx); Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 2(xx), 203\u2013214.]\n\nBhartrd\u0101man was known only as a Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa until Colonel Biddulph obtained the following coin on which he appears as K\u1e63atrapa.\n\nObv. Date illegible.\n\nRev.

Coll., No. 459\u2014and others on which the same reading is most probably to be restored\u2014e.g., Bh. Coll., No. 451.\n\nThe Rev. H. R. Scott says: \"We have three coins of Bhartrd\u0101man's styling him K\u1e63atrapa; one of these has date apparently 204.\" This suggested reading must, surely, be incorrect, as Bhartrd\u0101man appears as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa on a coin\u2014Bh. Coll., No. 441\u2014of which the date seems to be without doubt 203. But if it can be proved, it starts a problem, the solution of which is not apparent. He also mentions a coin of Bhartrd\u0101man as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, on which the date \"appears to be 220, but is not very clear.\" This is much more probable, but this date must remain very doubtful until a better specimen is found.\n\nWith regard to the name of this prince, there has been a division of opinion among scholars. Newton and Thomas read the name as \u0100tri; the reading Bhar\u1e6dr is that of Prinsep, Stevenson, and Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l. There are two points to be decided\u2014(1) Is the first ak\u1e63ara \u0905 or \u0906? (2) Is the second \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f or \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f? With regard to the former, it must be admitted that very often on these coins the character looks quite as much like a as bha, but there are instances (e.g., on two coins of Bhartrd\u0101man's son Vi\u015bvasena in the British Museum\u2014Steuart, 53, 4\u20135, 56 and 61) of what seems to be an undoubted bha of the ordinary form; with regard to the latter, there is no doubt on most specimens as to the reading rtr (often with the superscript r, but sometimes without) as opposed to tri. If, then, the possibility of a doubt be admitted as to the initial character, the second is surely sufficient of itself to decide the question. \u0100tri \u0905\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f can surely never have been written Art\u1e5b \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f. The probability, therefore, is in favour of the name Bhar\u1e6dr generally written with a somewhat abnormal initial bha.\n\nSome specimens of Bhartrd\u0101man's coinage, both as K\u1e63atrapa and as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa, have traces of the hundreds'\n\n1 Cf. Thomas, J.R.A.S., 1850, p. 58.\nfigure (200) of a date; and, in some cases, it seems probable that there was nothing following this. But as this is not quite certain, it will be best to write this date as $2(xx)$.\n\n**Simhasena, son of Rudrasena** (*Bh.*, p. 659).\n\nThe evidence on which this Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa is admitted into the dynasty is so extremely unsatisfactory that it is a question whether it will not be safest to omit him altogether. At all events, if he is provisionally retained in the list, his name should always be accompanied by a note of interrogation, and it should always be borne in mind that his existence depends on the evidence of a single coin, the reading of which is most uncertain.\n\nThe Pandit admits that \"the style of his coin differs considerably from those immediately preceding\" (*Bh.*, p. 659). This fact is by itself sufficient to throw doubt on the attribution proposed. But in addition to this the lettering is also different. Both style and lettering belong, in fact, to an earlier period, when the rounded *pa* had not as yet given place to the pointed *v* (cf. the inscriptions as given in my lithographed plate attached to the Pandit's article).\n\nLet us now examine the legend of this coin. The Pandit's reading is\u2014\n\n*R\u0101j\u00f1o Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapasa Rudrasenasa putrasa R\u0101j\u00f1o Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapasa Simhasenasa.*\n\nNow, in the first place, the name of the father is more probably spelt *-sahasa*, i.e. *-sihasa*, or *-simhasa* (v. the lithographed plate referred to above); and, secondly, the name of the reigning Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa himself is altogether doubtful. The first two *ak\u1e63aras* are quite uncertain; the last three are probably *-simhasa* or *-senasa*.\n\nFrom these considerations\u2014the form of the letter *pa*, the name of the father, and the termination of his own name\u2014it follows that we have here the coin of some Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa,\nwho was the son of Rudrasimha, son of Rudradaman (v. sup., p. 375), and whose name ended in -simha or -sena.\n\nWe know the following as sons of Rudrasimha\u2014Rudrasena, Sanghadaman, and D\u0101masena. The second is quite out of the question here; and the corrupted letters can scarcely have been intended to represent any ak\u1e63aras reaching below the line such as the Ru and dra of the first. The last is just possible; but it must be admitted that the beautifully neat letters of D\u0101masena\u2019s ordinary coinage offer a striking contrast to the straggling characters on this specimen. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that the difference between the two consists not in form but in the degree of finish. They almost certainly belong to the same period. Either, then, this is a coin unusually badly struck of D\u0101masena, or it belongs to some other son of Rudrasimha.\n\nVi\u015bvasena, son of Bhartrdaman (Bh., p. 659).\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 216\u2013225.]\n\nThe limits of date, as given by Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l, were 216 and 223. There are, however, two coins in the British Museum\u2014Steuart, 53, 4\u20135, 56, and one from Prinsep\u2014which read quite clearly 225.\n\nThe Rev. H. R. Scott mentions two coins of Vi\u015bvasena in the Rajkot Museum with probable dates 224 and 226. It is to be hoped that new specimens will be found to place the latter date beyond suspicion.\n\nRudrasimha, son of Sv\u0101mi J\u012bvadaman (Bh., p. 660).\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 22x\u2013231, 233 (?).]\n\nThe limits hitherto accepted are 231 and 240, but an examination of the specimens in the British Museum and those in Colonel Biddulph\u2019s cabinet shows that there are undoubted instances of a date 22x.\u00b9 The traces of the unit figure are invariably those of one extending belo\n\n\u00b9 Confirmed by the Rev.

It is also important, as at this period the two characters for ha and na have become so very similar, that, without its evidence, we might have been in some doubt whether to read the name of this K\u1e63atrapa as Rudrasimha or Rudrasena.\n\nBhagv\u0101nl\u0101l gives the latter limit of date as 240, and it is quite possible that he may have had good reasons for this. It must be said, however, that from the coins now available to us, we can be certain neither of this reading nor of the reading 234 also given. The latest probable date on the specimens in the British Museum is 233, and the latest certain date 231.\n\nYasod\u0101man, son of Rudrasimha (Bh., p. 660).\n\n[K\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 240\u2013249.]\n\nQuite a number of new dates have been discovered on coins of this K\u1e63atrapa, since Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l wrote. Colonel Biddulph\u2019s collection supplies the dates 242, 244, and 246?; and the British Museum the dates 243 (Cunn. Coll., 94, 5\u20137, 731) and 249 (Bird, 54, 5\u201329, 15). The description of the last mentioned is as follows:\u2014\n\nObv. Date, 249.\n\nRev. R\u0101j\u00f1a[h] K\u1e63atrapasa Rudras[i]haputrasa R\u0101j\u00f1a[h]\n\nK\u1e63atrapasa Yasod\u0101ma[h].\n\nB.M., Bird. \u00b755, wt. 31\u00b75 grs.; Pl. 12.\nRudrasena, son of Rudrad\u0101man (Bh., p. 661).\n[Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coins 270\u2013298, 300 (?).]\n\nColonel Biddulph points out to me that Sir E. Clive Bayley reads the date of one of his coins as 300. There is little reason to doubt this, and we shall be justified in regarding the reading as probably correct until it can be definitely proved.\n\nNo coins have yet been found of Rudrasena's father, the Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa Rudrad\u0101man. His reign must have filled some part of the great gap which is now left in our list of Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapas between the years 214 and 270\u2014the latest of Bhart\u1e5bd\u0101man and the earliest of Rudrasena; but as yet we can give no certain answer to the questions how he came into this dynasty and what relation he bore to his predecessors. The dotted line in Colonel Biddulph's genealogical table (p. 406) denotes that the position there assigned to him as a son of Sv\u0101mi Jivad\u0101man is purely conjectural, and remains to be proved or disproved by subsequent discoveries and researches. There are, of course, other possibilities\u2014he may have been the brother or son of Ya\u015bod\u0101man, or he may have been related in some way to the old line which seems to us to end with Vi\u015bvasena (216\u2013225), son of Bhart\u1e5bd\u0101man.\n\nThe reading of the name as Rudrasena and not Rudrasimha seems to be undoubtedly correct. On the greater number of these coins it is not easy to distinguish the letters ha and na, but some specimens, e.g. Bh. Coll., Nos. 554, 563, 574, 580, have the name Rudrasena without any possibility of doubt.\n\nSimhasena, sister's son of Rudrasena (Bh., p. 660).\n[Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coin 304.]\n\nVery important alterations have to be made in our account of this Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa. In the first place, Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l's coin is no longer unique. There are now two others from the\n\n1 J.R.A.S., 1882, p. 374.\nCunningham Collection in the British Museum, and Colonel Biddulph possesses a fourth. One of the Cunningham coins, 94, 5\u20137, 331, published by General Cunningham in his *Coins of Medi\u00e6val India*, p. 8, pl. i, 14, undoubtedly bears the date 304. It is, therefore, necessary to place Simhasena some forty or fifty years later than was contemplated by Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l, who supposed him to be a nephew of Rudrasimha, son of Jivad\u0101man, and a cousin and successor of Yasod\u0101man (K\u1e63atrapa, 240\u2013249). That he should have reigned for fifty-five years after the latest date on his predecessor's coins might be possible, but would be, to say the least, remarkable. But there is another difficulty in the way of this supposition, which is noted by Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l himself. Rudrasimha is known from his own coins and those of his son Yasod\u0101man only as a K\u1e63atrapa. He would appear, if this attribution were correct, on those of his nephew as a Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa.\n\nGeneral Cunningham, seeing these difficulties, supposed him to be the sister's son of the Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa Rudrasimha, son of Satyasimha, who himself strikes coins in the year 310 (*Coins of Med. Ind.*, p. 4). This correction does not make matters altogether plain. It gives us a Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa who strikes coins in 304 and calls himself the sister's son of another Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa who reigns after him in 310! Suppositions of revolution and counter-revolution will always suggest a way out of these little chronological difficulties; but they are quite unnecessary here.\n\nThe plain fact is that Simhasena is sister's son of Rudrasena, not of Rudrasimha. The difficulty of distinguishing between the letters *ha* and *na* on these late coins has been previously referred to; and it may be granted that it is next to impossible to discriminate between the two on the Cunningham coin figured in *Coins of Med. Ind.*, pl. i, 14, and on the Pandit's own specimen (cf., for instance, the *ha* and the *na* of the word *Simhasenasa* as it appears in the facsimile in my lithographed plate to the Pandit's article). On Colonel Biddulph's coin, however, and on the Cunningham coin given in *Med. Ind.*, pl. i, 15, a distinction between\nthe two characters is certainly made in this word (Simhasenasya on the Cunningham specimen); and if the other proper name\u2014absent, unfortunately, from Colonel Biddulph's coin\u2014be examined in the light of this distinction, the remaining traces of the character in question certainly show that it was na and not ha.\n\nThe description of the specimen still unpublished is as follows:\u2014\n\nObv. No distinct traces of date or inscription.\n\nRev. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja-k\u1e63atra[pa . . . . . . . . . . . . ]\n\nR\u0101j\u00f1o Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapasa Sv\u0101mi Simhasenasya.\n\nColonel Biddulph. -55, wt. 26 grs.; Pl. 14.\n\nThere is, therefore, some positive evidence in favour of the change of the old reading Rudrasimha to Rudrasena; but, even if the confusion of the two letters ha and na were quite hopeless, we should be justified in making this change on purely chronological grounds.\n\nIn addition to this, the inscriptions of all these coins as hitherto given require correction. The readings of Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l (Bh., p. 660) and Cunningham, Med. Ind., p. 8, pl. i, 14, should be amended by the substitution of svasriyasya or possibly svasriyasya, \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f or \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f, for the impossible form svasryasya \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f (Bh.), and for svasriyasa (Cunn.). The distinction between r and ra (ri, ri) appended to a consonant is almost invariably observed on these coins.\n\nAccording to General Cunningham's reading of his other coin (Med. Ind., p. 8, pl. i, 15), Simhasena is called the son of Rudrasimha (recte Rudrasena). It would indeed be strange to find the same person described sometimes as the son and sometimes as the nephew of another! But this is not the case. The reading is wrong. It should be\u2014\n\nMah\u0101r\u0101ja-k\u1e63atrapa-sv\u0101mi-Rudrasena-svasriya[sya] R\u0101j\u00f1o Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapasa Sv\u0101mi-Simhasenasya.\n\nThe impartial use of the Prakrit and Sanskrit genitive terminations on these coins is curious.\nIt will be noticed that the two classes of Simhasena's coins show that Rudrasena bore the titles sometimes of R\u0101ja Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa Sv\u0101mi and sometimes of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja K\u1e63atraka Sv\u0101mi. Whether there was any difference in rank denoted by these two designations is not certain.\n\n[Rudra]sen\u0101, son of Simhasena.\n\n[Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: no dated coins or inscriptions.]\n\nColonel Biddulph's recently acquired specimen of this Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa is at present unique.\n\nObv.

The first syllable is probably ra or ru, or perhaps some compound of which one or other of these forms the second portion. The second syllable seems more like tr or dr than dra. It is possible that the name may prove to be Tr\u0101\u1e6drasena, or some such form; but, on the whole, it is perhaps more probable that the name is Rudrasena, with the second character of a somewhat peculiar shape.\n\nRudrasimha, son of Satyasimha (Bh., p. 662).\n\n[Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa: dated coin 310.]\n\nThe date 310, quoted by Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l on the authority of Dr. B\u00fchler and General Cunningham, is quite beyond doubt. It occurs on two of the Cunningham coins\u2014the one published in Med. Ind., p. 7, pl. i, 13, was held to be somewhat doubtful until the discovery of the other (Cunn., 94, 5-7, 744) dispelled all doubt as to the correctness of the reading. The only question now is whether the date may not have been 31x.\n\nJ.M.A.S. 1899.\nThe Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa Satyasimha is still unrepresented in our collections by any coins of his own. His relationship to his predecessors is therefore doubtful, and the position provisionally assigned to him in Colonel Biddulph's table is purely conjectural. Between the years 304 and 310 (or perhaps 31x), we find no fewer than four Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapas\u2014Simhasena and his son [?] Rudra]sena, Satyasimha and his son Rudrasimha. The most probable conjecture is that Satyasimha was a brother of Simhasena.\n\nThe Billon Coinage.\n\nThere is very little to add to what has been already published about the billon and lead coinages. These classes have never been properly collected and studied, and it is probable that they are as yet only very partially known to us.\n\nThe billon coins are of two kinds:\u2014\n\nA. Obv. Humped bull to r., inscription in Greek characters; (when more perfect specimens are discovered we may reasonably expect to find the date as on the silver coins).\n\nRev. Chakra; r., star; l., crescent; inscription as on the silver coins, but without the father's name.\n\nExamples of this class are:\u2014\n\n(1) The coin figured by Prinsep (Essays, ed. Thomas, vol. ii, pl. xxxvii, 14), now in the British Museum. Unfortunately the inscription is only R\u0101j\u00f1o Mah\u0101k\u1e63atra[...], and we are, therefore, not able to determine its attribution very accurately. The clear, bold characters seem, however, to justify us in assigning it to an early period.\n\n(2) Cunningham, Coins of Med. Ind., p. 7, pl. i, 9. A coin of Rudrasimha wrongly attributed to Rudrad\u0101man. The inscription, which is quite distinct, should be thus corrected: R\u0101j\u00f1o [mah\u0101]ksatrapasa Rudrasihasa. The coin, therefore, belongs to one of the two periods\u2014from 103 to 110, and from 113 to 118\u2014during which Rudrasimha reigned as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa.\nOF SUR\u0100\u015a\u012aRA AND M\u0100LAVA.\n\n(3) Id., p. 7, pl. i, 8.

Usual type, but without inscription; date beneath caitya.\n\nThe known dates on specimens of this class are\u2014147, 14z, 153, and 15z. General Cunningham (op. cit., p. 7, pl. i, 10) read the date on one of his specimens as 129; but the unit figure is almost certainly 8, and there is some doubt about the decimal figure. It is certainly not a 20 of the usual form, and may possibly be a corruption of some other numeral, perhaps 50.\n\nIt seems reasonable to suppose that class B is later in date than class A.\n\nThe Lead Coinage.\n\nNo new dates have as yet been discovered on the square coins of lead belonging to this dynasty. The dates on the specimens\u2014all from the collection of Colonel Sykes\u2014published by Thomas in this Journal (1850, p. 61, pl. ii, 27\u201331), include all the years from 280 to 286, and, if the date on figure 32 should be read reversedly as Thomas suggests, 294.\n\nAll the specimens in the British Museum belong to the Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l Collection. The only legible date on them is 284.\n\nColonel Biddulph possesses specimens dated 284 and 285, the latter of which is here described.\n\nObv. Humped bull to r.\nRev. Caitya; r., star; l., crescent; date, 285.\n\nColonel Biddulph. '55; Pl. 15.\n\nIt will be noticed, then, that all the dates hitherto found on these leaden coins fall within the reign of Mk\u1e63. Rudrasena, son of Rudrad\u0101man (270\u2013300?).\n\nThe use of a currency in lead is common to the Andhras and Western K\u1e63atrapas; but, whereas in the case of the\nformer it extended over a very considerable period, it is confined in the case of the latter\u2014so far as we know at present\u2014to a few years. It seems quite possible that a leaden currency may have been characteristic of some particular district, the possession of which passed temporarily from the Andhras to the Western K\u1e63atrapas.\n\nNOTE ON THE ORDER OF SUCCESSION OF MAH\u0100K\u1e62ATRAPAS AND K\u1e62ATRAPAS.\n\nBy Colonel J. Biddulph.\n\nWhat knowledge we have of these rulers is almost entirely derived from their coins. The earlier coins are undated, and, of the later ones, the dates are often illegible. Were it not for the practice of each one putting his father's name on his coins as well as his own, we should often be at a loss to discover the order of their succession. Even with this assistance there appears at first sight to be much confusion. The dates often overlap. Some rulers bore the title of K\u1e63atrapa only, others bore the title of Mah\u0101k\u1e63atrapa only; some bore both titles at different times. Others, again, figure as Mah\u0101k\u1e63atraps whose fathers were only K\u1e63atraps.\n\nA very simple rearrangement of their names seems to give the clue to the relations that existed between the K\u1e63atraps and Mah\u0101k\u1e63atraps. By placing all the Mah\u0101k\u1e63atraps on one list according to dates when they bore that title, and excluding them and others while bearing the title of K\u1e63atrapa, there is no longer any overlapping of dates, and we have a succession of rulers who cover the period from Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana to the latest ascertained date of Bhartrd\u0101man, viz. 214. In the same manner, by placing all with the K\u1e63atrapa title on a separate list according to date, we find the whole period fairly covered, but with occasional gaps, from Ca\u1e63\u1e6dana down to the last K\u1e63atrapa Ya\u015bod\u0101man, whose latest ascertained date is 249. The inference is clear,\nthat the heir of the ruling Mah\u0101ksatrapa bore the title of K\u1e63atrapa, and had coins issued in his name during his father's lifetime. The fact that some of the K\u1e63atraps before Bhartrd\u0101man, viz., Jayad\u0101man, Satyad\u0101man, Prthivisen\u0101, D\u0101majada, and Virad\u0101man never assumed the higher title might easily be accounted for by their having died before their fathers, or it may be that they reigned for so short a time that none of the few coins they can have issued as Mah\u0101ksatraps have yet been discovered.\n\nAfter Bhartrd\u0101man a disturbance in the direct succession apparently occurred, and the title of Mah\u0101ksatrapa seems to have remained in abeyance for many years. His last known date is 214, and he is depicted on his latest coins as an old man. His son Vi\u015bvasena only held the title of K\u1e63atrapa eleven years after Bhartrd\u0101man's latest date, and from 214 to 270, the next ascertained date of a Mah\u0101ksatrapa, we have only one intervening Mah\u0101ksatrapa, Rudrad\u0101man, of whom no coin has been found, and whose parentage is therefore unknown. At the same time we have two K\u1e63atraps, Rudrasimha and Yasod\u0101man, father and son, in succession to Vi\u015bvasena, but not directly descended from any of their predecessors, so far as is known.\n\nThe evidence is in favour of the supposition that for nearly sixty years the title of Mah\u0101ksatrapa remained in abeyance. After Rudrasena's comparatively long reign, 270\u2013298, 300 P, we have certainly one, if not two, breaks in the direct descent, and, of the four Mah\u0101ksatraps known to us in the ensuing ten or twelve years, one is known from a single coin only, another is known only from his son's coinage, while of the remaining two hardly a dozen coins have been found.

XIII.\u2014Yet More Light on 'Umar-i-Khayy\u0101m.\n\nBy E. G. Browne, M.R.A.S.\n\nAs Mr. Beveridge has referred to my criticism (which is in reality not mine, but Professor A. M\u00fcller's, cited by Professor Houtsma in a footnote on pp. xiv\u2013xv of his edition of al-Bund\u0101r\u012b's History of the Seljuqs) on the now familiar story of 'Umar's covenant with the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk and Hasan-i-Sabb\u0101h, I should be glad to have an opportunity of stating that my recent reading has shown me that this tale at least reposes on more ancient and respectable authority than either the Rau\u1e0datu-s-Saf\u0101 or the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Alfi, namely, on that of the J\u0101mi'u't-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh of Rash\u012bdu'd-Din, who was put to death in A.H. 718.

'Umar-i-Khayy\u0101m waited upon him and reminded him of the vows and covenants of their boyish days. The Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk, recognizing these old claims, said, 'The government of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br and the surrounding...\"\ndistricts is thine.' But 'Umar, who was a great man, and withal an eminent philosopher and a man of sense, replied, 'I have no desire for the government of a province or for the restraining of the people by command and prohibition. Rather assign to me an allowance or stipend of the nature of a salary or pension.' So the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk assigned him an allowance of ten thousand din\u0101rs from the treasury of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br, to be paid and delivered to him year by year without diminution or charge.\n\n\"In like manner 'Our Master' [\u1e24asan-i-Sabb\u0101h] came from the city of Ray to wait on him, and said, 'The noble man, when he promises, performs.' 'Choose,' answered the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk, 'the government of Ray or that of Isfah\u0101n.' 'Our Master,' being a man of high ambition, was not contented or satisfied with so much, and refused to accept it; for he cherished hopes of participating in the office of Prime Minister. So the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk bade him attend the King's Court for a while; but, perceiving that he was desirous of the post of Prime Minister, and was aiming at his position and office, avoided him, and continued on his guard against him. After some years the King conceived a slight mistrust of the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk, and required of him a statement of the revenue accounts.\" [The remainder of the narrative agrees substantially with that of the spurious \u1e34a\u1e63\u0101ya\u1e0d, the Dabist\u0101n, and the histories of M\u012brkhw\u0101nd and Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, given by Whinfield on pp. ix-xi of the Introduction to his Quatrains of 'Omar Khayy\u0101m (Tr\u00fcbner, 1883), and familiar to all of that large and increasing class who interest themselves more or less seriously in the Astronomer-Poet.]\n\nAn older and better authority than even the J\u0101mi'u'l-Tav\u0101ri\u1e33h for the history of the Assassins and their founder (with which the history of 'Umar-i-Khayy\u0101m and the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk is so closely linked in the tradition above cited) is the Jah\u0101n-Kush\u0101, the author of which, 'Al\u0101'u'd-D\u012bn 'At\u0101 Malik Juvayn\u012b, was present with Hul\u0101g\u016b Kh\u0101n at the capitulation of Alam\u016bt, the chief stronghold of the Persian Assassins, in A.H. 654, and was entrusted with the\ntask of examining the books of the sect preserved in that place, with a view to the destruction of all such as savoured of heresy. Amongst these books, as he informs us (British Museum MS., Or. 155, f. 255), he found a volume containing the biography and adventures of \u1e24asan-i-\u1e62abb\u0101h, called by them [i.e. the Assassins] 'the Adventures of Our Master' [Sar-guzasht-i-Sayyidn\u0101], from which he derived most of the particulars which he gives of the career of that remarkable man.

Death of Hasan-i-\u015eabb\u00e2h.\n\nI now propose to examine the dates which Mr. Beveridge attempts to establish, and to show that some at least of them are untenable, if that be admitted which appears an obvious canon of historical criticism, viz. that *caeteris paribus* the older account of any transaction is entitled to greater credence than the more modern, especially when it can be definitely traced back to a writer of repute and intelligence who was contemporary, or almost contemporary, with the events he describes, or who had at his disposal sources of unusual authority. Thus, Nidh\u00e2m\u00ee-i-'Ar\u00fbd\u00ee of Samarqand,\nthe author of the Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la, was personally acquainted with \u2018Umar-i-Khayy\u0101m, and therefore is more likely to give correct information about him than late writers such as those cited by Mr. Beveridge, and this writer (of whose Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la I have made a complete translation, which will, I hope, appear in the next two numbers of the Journal) relates two anecdotes concerning \u2018Umar in the chapter consecrated to Astrologers.\n\nThe first of these (T\u012bhr\u0101n lith. of A.H. 1305, pp. 130\u2013131) relates to \u2018Umar\u2019s prognostication, made in A.H. 506 (A.D. 1112\u20131113) at Balkh, in the Street of the Slave-sellers, in the house of Am\u012br Ab\u016b Sa\u2019d, in the presence of Khw\u0101ja Mudhaffar-i-Isfiz\u0101r\u012b and the author, that the trees should shed their blossoms (not roses, as the \u201cOmarites\u201d do falsely suppose; for gul in Persian means not only the rose, but any flower, and the sequel shows that the blossoms whereby the prognostication was fulfilled were those of pear-trees and peach-trees\u2014amr\u016bd u zard\u0101l\u016b) on his grave. This story shows clearly that \u2018Umar was alive at least a year after the date (A.H. 505) in which Mr. Beveridge would like to place his death, and probably several years later, for the writer continues:\u2014\u201cWhen I arrived at N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br in the year A.H. 530 (= A.D. 1135\u20131136), it being then some years since that great man [i.e. \u2018Umar] had veiled his countenance in the dust, . . . . I went to visit his grave.\u201d\n\nThe second anecdote (T\u012bhr\u0101n lith., pp. 131\u2013133) relates to an astrological prediction made by \u2018Umar \u201cin the winter of the year A.H. 508\u201d (A.D. 1114\u20131115), three years after the date assigned to his decease by Mr. Beveridge. The latter, therefore, cannot, in my opinion, be defended, and there seems to be no reason for abandoning the date (A.H. 517: see Rieu\u2019s Persian Catalogue, p. 546) hitherto generally accepted.\n\nAs regards \u1e24asan-i-\u1e62abb\u0101\u1e25, the date A.H. 518 is given as that of his death, not only by the J\u0101mi\u2018u\u2019t-Tawd\u012bkh, but also by Ibnu\u2019l-Ath\u012br and the author of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Gus\u012bda.\n\nAs regards the Nidh\u0101mu\u2019l-Mulk, the date of so important an event as his assassination was not likely to be forgotten,\nand we find, in point of fact, all reputable authorities at one in placing it in Ramad\u0101n, A.H. 485. Ibnu'l-Ath\u012br definitely states, in recounting his death, that he was born in A.H. 408; while his age is stated by the J\u0101mi'u't-Taw\u0101rikh to have been at the time of his death not, as Mr. Beveridge asserts (on what authority I know not), \"about seventy-five,\" but \"over eighty,\" which agrees very well with Ibnu'l-Ath\u012br.\n\nI think, therefore, that we may take it for granted\u2014\n\n(1) That the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk was born in A.H. 408 (= A.D. 1017), or thereabouts, at the very latest.\n\n(2) That it is exceedingly improbable that 'Umar-i-Khayy\u0101m and \u1e24asan-i-\u1e62abb\u0101h, both of whom died natural deaths in the years A.H. 517\u2013518 (= A.D. 1123\u20131124), were more than a hundred years old at the time of their decease.\n\n(3) That even if we assume both 'Umar and \u1e24asan to have been centenarians, and consequently place their births about A.D. 1023, they would still have been six years younger than the Nidh\u0101mu'l-Mulk, and the three could hardly have been 'boys' or 'children' together, as is implied in the J\u0101mi'u't-Taw\u0101rikh.\n\n(4) That the story is exceedingly improbable, though not absolutely impossible, and, did it rest merely on books like the spurious Wa\u1e63ya, the Dabist\u0101n, etc., would scarcely merit serious consideration; but that the testimony of the J\u0101mi'u't-Taw\u0101rikh, both on account of its early date, and the repute of its author as a historian, cannot be dismissed so lightly.\n\nIt must, however, be borne in mind that no great lapse of time is needed for the growth even of legends of a far more surprising character. The spurious Autobiography of N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusraw, regarded by Eth\u00e9 as \"a fabrication of the ninth or tenth century of the hijra, unworthy of serious attention,\" is hardly richer in marvels than the notice given by Qazw\u012bn\u012b in his \u0100th\u0101ru't-Bil\u0101d (ed. W\u00fcstenfeld, pp. 328\u20139, s.v. \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631), written in the first half of the\nseventh century of the hijra, not more than 200 years after the poet's death. It would, I believe, be worth while to make a careful examination and analysis of the spurious Autobiography, with a view to determining which portions were, or might be, genuinely historical, which were absolutely fictitious, and which could be traced to a confusion of identities. I am almost convinced, for example, that that portion of the narrative which deals with the adventures of N\u0101\u1e63ir amongst the Mal\u0101hid\u0101 ('Heretics,' a term especially used to denote the Assassins, who, of course, did not exist at this epoch, since their power in the Caspian provinces began with the seizure of Alam\u016bt by \u1e24asan-i-\u1e62abb\u0101h in A.H. 483, and he himself, their founder, was, as we have already seen at p. 412 supra, converted to the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b doctrines by N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusraw's successor, Amir Darr\u0101b) arose from a confusion of him with the celebrated philosopher Na\u1e63\u012br-i-T\u016bs\u012b (d. A.H. 655), who actually did compose the first edition of his well-known Akhl\u0101q-i-N\u0101\u1e63iri for the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b governor of Qubist\u0101n, Na\u1e63\u012bru'd-D\u012bn 'Abdu'r-Ra\u1e25\u012bm b. Abi Mans\u016br. (See Rieu's Persian Catalogue, pp. 441\u20132.) It is also worth noticing that the anecdote given in the spurious Autobiography, and translated at pp. 479\u2013480 of my Year amongst the Persians, concerning the rending in pieces of one of N\u0101\u1e63ir's disciples by the orthodox at Nish\u0101pur, is also given in the short notice of N\u0101\u1e63ir's life prefixed to the selections from his poems in the India Office MS. No. 132 (Selections from six old Persian poets, dated A.H. 714), and is therefore of considerable antiquity.\n\nAs I have had occasion to mention N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusraw, I should like to declare my complete agreement with the view held by Dr. Eth\u00e9 and the late M. Schefer as to the identity of the poet and the traveller. The case for the dual theory is most clearly stated by Professor Rieu (Pers. Cat., p. 380), but nearly all his objections to the identity of the poet with the traveller can be met; for\u2014\n\n(1) I have read carefully through the whole Diwan of the poet (Tabriz lith. of A.H. 1280) and find no single\nallusion to Isfah\u0101n, but a great many to Khur\u0101s\u0101n, amongst which the following clearly shows that it was the poet's birthplace (p. 241):\n\n\u06af\u0631\u0686\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0635\u0644 \u062e\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0627\u0632 \u067e\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0648 \u0645\u0647\u06cc \u0648 \u0645\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u060c\n\u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631\u062a \u0648 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u06a9\u0631\u062f \u0645\u0631\u0627 \u06cc\u0645\u06af\u06cc \u0648 \u0645\u0627\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u060c\n\n\"Although my origin is from Khur\u0101s\u0101n, after spiritual leadership, authority, and supremacy\nLove for the Family and House of the Prophet have made me a man of Yamg\u0101n and M\u0101zandar\u0101n.\"\n\n(2) The chronological difficulty presented by the dates found in some copies of the Rawshand\u012b's N\u0101ma (A.H. 420, Gotha MS.; A.H. 343, Leyden MS.) is to be overcome, as maintained by Eth\u00e9, only by a rejection of these dates as clerical errors; for no one has hitherto ventured to maintain that the Div\u0101n of N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusraw and the R. N. are by different authors, and\u2014\n\n(3) As pointed out by Eth\u00e9, the author of the Div\u0101n explicitly states (Tabr\u012bz lith., p. 110) that he was born in A.H. 394, and that, after spending the first part of his life in worldliness and dissipation, he began to \"seek after wisdom\" at the age of 42 (elsewhere, speaking in round numbers, he speaks of his age at this turning-point in his life as 40, e.g., Tabr\u012bz lith., p. 217), i.e. about A.H. 436.\n\n(4) In the Safar-n\u0101ma (ed. Schefer, p. r), in relating the dream which caused him to set out on his travels to search for Truth, he says that he had \"awakened from a sleep of forty years\"; and, a few lines lower down, he gives the date of his departure on his journey as Thursday, 6th of Jum\u0101da II, A.H. 437; all of which very closely and strikingly corresponds with the above deductions concerning the author of the Div\u0101n.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nIn the *J\u0101mi\u02bfu\u02bet-Taw\u0101ri\u1e35* (British Museum MS., Add. 7,628), besides the reference to N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusr\u0101w (f. 290v) as the head of the Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b propaganda in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, he is again mentioned on f. 286b as follows:\n\n\u0648 \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u062e\u0633\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0635\u0631 \u0622\u0645\u062f \u0648 \u0647\u0641\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0633\u0627\u06a9\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0647\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0686\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u0641\u062a \u0648 \u0628\u0635\u0631 \u0631\u062c\u0648\u0639 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f \u062d\u062c \u0628\u0635\u0631 \u0622\u0645\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0627 \u062e\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u06af\u0634\u062a \u0648 \u067e\u0646\u062c \u062f\u0639\u0648\u062a \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0635\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0627\u0639\u062f\u0627 \u0642\u0635\u062f \u0627\u0648 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0628\u0631\u06a9\u0647 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0634\u062f \u0648 \u062a\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0631 \u0622\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0628\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u06af\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u062a\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0644\u062a \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0646\u0645\u0648\u062f\u060c \u0648 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0628\u0627\u062c \u062d\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0647\u200c\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u0639\u062c\u0645 \u0628\u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0646\u062c\u0627\u0631 \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 [\u0631\u0641\u062a] \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0639\u0648\u062a \u062a\u0648\u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u06a9 \u0639\u062c\u0645 \u06a9\u0646\u0645\u060c \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u062c\u0627\u0632\u062a \u062f\u0627\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0648 \u0628\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u0648 \u0628\u0631\u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0639\u0648\u062a \u06a9\u0646\u0645\u060c \u06af\u0641\u062a \u0628\u0631\u0641\u0631\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0645 \u0646\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0622\u0646\u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0647\u0631\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0639\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0646\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0648 \u0645\u06cc\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u06cc\u0627\u0631 \u0642\u0644\u0639 \u062a\u0647\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u062f \u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0632\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u06af\u0641\u062a.\n\n\"N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusr\u0101w, attracted by the fame of al-Mustansir, came from Khur\u0101s\u0101n to Egypt, where he abode seven years, performing the pilgrimage every year and returning to Egypt. Finally he came, after performing the pilgrimage, to Ba\u1e63ra, and returned to Khur\u0101s\u0101n, where he carried on a propaganda for the \u2018Alids of Egypt\u2019 [i.e. the F\u0101\u1e6dimid Caliphs] in Balkh. His enemies attempted to destroy him, and he became a fugitive in the mountain of Siming\u0101n, where he remained for twenty years, content to exist on water and herbs. \u1e24asan-i-\u1e62abb\u0101\u1e25, the Himyarite, of Yemen, came from Persia before al-Mustansir bi\u02bell\u0101h disguised as a carpenter, asking his permission to carry...\"\non a propaganda for him in the Persian lands. This permission having been accorded to him, he enquired secretly of al-Mustansir in whose name the propaganda should be carried on after his death. 'In the name of my son Niz\u0101r,' replied the Caliph, 'who is the elder.' For this reason the Ism\u0101'\u012blis [of Persia] maintain the Im\u0101mate of Niz\u0101r. And 'Our Master' [i.e. \u1e24asan-i-Sabb\u0101h] chose [as the centres of his propaganda] the Castles of Qubist\u0101n, as we shall presently relate.\"\n\nNow in his Safar-n\u0101ma N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusraw mentions visiting Mecca for the fourth time in A.H. 442 (ed. Schefer, p. 18), and returning thence to Ba\u1e63ra in A.H. 443 (p. 19), Isfah\u0101n in Muharram, A.H. 444 (p. 17), and Khur\u0101s\u0101n in Jum\u0101da II, A.H. 444, all of which agrees pretty well with the above. At this last date he must have been about 50 years of age (since seven years elapsed between his departure for Egypt, at the age of 42, and his return thence). Twenty years more in Siming\u0101n (see B. de Meynard's Dict. . . de la Perse, pp. 317, 318, s.v. \u0628\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0646) would bring him to the age of 70. In his Diw\u0101n he incidentally mentions his age in numerous passages; e.g., age 40 and 42 (Tabriz lith., pp. 217 and 110); age 50 (pp. 20, 219, 230, 263); age 50 and odd (p. 78); age 60 (pp. 24, 79, 102, 164, 173, 179, 199, 244); age 62 (pp. 166, 171); age 60 and odd (p. 70); and he also gives the period of his pilgrimages and stay in Egypt as six years (p. 113). As the author of the Safar-n\u0101ma reached Egypt in \u0160afar, A.H. 439, and came to Ba\u1e63ra on his homeward journey in Sha'b\u0101n, A.H. 443, his sojourn in the West was, in fact, only four years and a half, but he appears to have reckoned from the date of his departure from Khur\u0101s\u0101n (Jum\u0101da II, A.H. 437) to his return thither (Jum\u0101da II, A.H. 444), which was exactly seven years. As he performed the pilgrimage, so far as practicable, every year during this seven years' absence from home, it is easy to see how the implication of the J\u0101mi'u't-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh, that he performed it seven times, arose.\nI think, therefore, that there can be no doubt as to the identity of the poet N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusraw and the traveller N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusraw, and that the dualistic theory must be finally abandoned. Indeed, it seems to have been necessitated merely by the statements of late biographers, like Dawlatsh\u0101h, who drew their information from the spurious autobiography and other equally untrustworthy sources.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. TORRES STRAITS LANGUAGES.\n\nGrand Hotel, Thursday Island,\nTorres Straits.\nNov. 8, 1898.\n\nMy dear Sir,\u2014As you will see by above address, I acceded to Professor Haddon's request that I should accompany the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits. Leave was granted me from my school studies. We have been enabled to make a very interesting study of the natives of the Torres Straits Islands, and of the Hood Bay, Port Moresby, and Yule Island natives in New Guinea. You will be interested to know of the philological material which I have been able to gather:\n\n1. Grammar and Vocabulary of the Murray Island language.\n2. Grammar and Vocabulary of Mabuiag and other dialects of Western Torres Straits.\n3. Grammatical notes of:\n   (a) Hula and Keapara (Hood Bay).\n   (b) Sinangoro (inland from Kapakapa) and Aloma (east of Hood Bay).\n   (c) Cloudy Bay.\n   (d) Grammar of Nara or Pokan language (east of Hall Sound).\n   (e) Roro (Yule Island), Mekeo (St. Joseph River).\n   (f) Kiwai (Fly River).\n(g) Note on language of Cape York tribe (North Queensland).\n(h) Grammatical note on Koitapu language (Port Moresby).\n\nI find that there is a great advantage in making inquiries as to language on the spot, and have received much help from missionaries.\n\nSYDNEY H. RAY.\n\n2. P\u0101li MSS. IN NEPAL.\n\nKathmandu, Jan. 1, 1899.\n\nDear David,\u2014You will be interested, and doubtless also other P\u0101li scholars, to hear that I have found in the Mahar\u0101ja's library here, in a bundle of unrecognized fragments, three palm-leaves in Gupta character, evidently from a large book, and containing an index to some P\u0101li suttas, and giving the beginning of each sutta in P\u0101li. Of course, I have no P\u0101li reference-books here, and cannot say whether the leaves were at the end of a MS. of one of the Nik\u0101yas; but I have photographed them, so we can work this point out at leisure. But it is satisfactory to find that in this country, which one considered hitherto exclusively Mah\u0101y\u0101nist, the H\u012bnay\u0101na literature was known in early times. It is only another proof (if proof were needed) to show how absurd it is to call the H\u012bnay\u0101na 'Southern,' and to identify P\u0101li literature exclusively with Ceylon, Burma, and the South. In the same bundle were some fragments of a Sanskrit Buddhist work written in a character hitherto only known in Central Asia, and called by H\u00f6rnle 'Central Asian Nagari.'\u2014Yours truly,\n\nC. BENDALL.\n\n3. BUDDHIST SCULPTURES FROM TAKHT-\u012a-BAH\u012a.\n\nThe two panels of carved stone represented by the accompanying photographs were found, after the Malakhand expedition of 1897, in the ruins of Takht-\u012a-Bah\u012b, an ancient fortified city which is situated in the Yusufzai country near\nHoti-Mardan on the N.W. frontier, and in which a number of other Buddhistic sculptures had previously been unearthed. The panel with the large central figure of Buddha was dug up in the ruined monastery of the town in December, 1897. It was found lying face downwards about five feet below some d\u00e9bris, having apparently fallen from a wall above. The other panel was found in the same ruins. Both are carved in a soft blue micaceous slate. Along with the larger panel was dug up a copper coin representing on one side a lion and on the other a man riding an elephant. This coin has been identified by an authority on Indian numismatics as one of King Huvishka's, dating from about 100 A.D. The stones are in the possession of Miss J. E. Hume, at present resident at Hurbanswala, Dehra Dun. The original photographs by Mr. F. Giles, C.S., were enlarged by Sands, Hunter, & Co. These enlargements are here reproduced on a smaller scale.\n\nBoth panels evidently represent scenes from the life of Buddha, who is identifiable in both cases by his halo. In the larger panel he forms the central figure, and is distinguished by his great size as well as his halo. He seems to be receiving an offering from the two N\u0101gas on his left, whose serpent nature is represented by the snakes rising up from between their shoulder-blades. The altar behind which they are standing resembles that represented on p. 96 in Gr\u00fcnwedel's Buddhistische Kunst. The figure to the right holding a vajra in his left hand is probably M\u0101ra. Behind and to the right of him in the air is a Gandharva, who, recognizable by his garland and the vina in his left, is holding up a fruit in his right hand. Those who are more familiar with Buddhistic legends than I am will probably be able to identify the scenes depicted on these two carved stones. The sculptures are probably to be assigned to the first century A.D., the early period of Buddhistic art in which Greek influence is more marked; but others will be able to pronounce on the question of their approximate date with more knowledge than I possess.\n\nA. A. Macdonell.\n4. Persian Manuscript attributed to Fakhr\u016bdd\u012bn R\u0101z\u012b.\n\nStrassburg,\nFeb. 11, 1899.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014The Aja Sofia in Constantinople has a copy of the work described by Mr. Nicholson in your January number. It is contained in a work numbered in their catalogue No. 3,694, and bearing the title \u062d\u0641\u0638 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0646.\n\nAlso the \"Four Discourses,\" Chah\u0101r Maq\u0101la, of Ar\u016b\u1e0dh\u012b, mentioned by Mr. E. G. Browne, on p. 40 of the same issue, is in Stambul, in the Ashir Effendi Library, in the MS. No. 285, 116 foll.\n\nSeveral of the works referred to in Professor Eth\u00e9's sketch of Persian literature in the \"Grundriss der Iranischen Philologie\" as unique, must also now lose that distinction since the publication of the catalogues of the Constantinople libraries.\n\nSince I saw how much of the celebrated medical compendium, \"The Treasure of Khv\u0101rezmsh\u0101h,\" was drawn from older sources, especially Avicenna (see my paper in the Wiener Zeitschrift f. d. Kunde des Morg., iv, 131-143), I have very small confidence in the originality of all such Persian handbooks of general medicine. And it is not likely that so great an encyclopaedist as R\u0101z\u012b was altogether original in his medical work. The extracts given in my article just referred to would, I think, convince Mr. Nicholson of the very close connection between R\u0101z\u012b's work and the \"Treasure of Khv\u0101rezmsh\u0101h.\" And as the latter is older than R\u0101z\u012b, R\u0101z\u012b may have used it; and may even possibly be referring to its author, Isma'il ibn \u1e24asan ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u1e24amad al \u1e24usain\u012b al Jurj\u0101n\u012b, when he speaks of 'the Saiyid,' son of Im\u0101m Isma'il. Perhaps Mr. Nicholson would be so kind as to give us a further communication on this point.\n\nMay I be allowed to take this opportunity of calling attention to another point which has hitherto, I think, escaped attention.\nNa'im\u0101 tells us (Stambul edition of A.H. 1281, vol. ii, p. 220, at the end) how the soldiers went to and set free the prisoners there. Were a scholar to undertake a learned inquiry as to who this Baba Ja'far was, taking him as the builder of the prison, he would go wrong. It is soldiers' slang. As German soldiers call the place of detention 'Vater Philip' (see my book \"Die deutsche Soldaten-sprache,\" Giessen, 1899, p. 121), so the Turks call it Baba Ja'far. So the Turks call a recruit \u062c\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646. This also has its analogy in the slang of the Bavarian soldiers, who call a recruit a 'Russian' (loc. cit., p. 36). We should not be surprised that so exclusive a cast as the Janissaries should have developed a jargon of this kind; and no doubt other Orientalists will have come across other instances of this interesting slang in the course of their reading.\u2014Believe me, sincerely yours,\n\nPaul Horn.\n\nTo Professor Rhys Davids.\n\n5. The Pepp\u00e9 Inscription.\n\nAsiatic Society of Bengal,\n57, Park Street, Calcutta.\nFeb. 10, 1899.\n\nSir,\u2014I have just read Mr. V. A. Smith's note on the \u015a\u0101kya Inscription from Pipr\u0101h\u0101w\u0101 in the last July number of your Journal. Owing to the importance of this document, as also to the fact that I had an opportunity of examining the original urn, which, together with the other relics, is now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, I beg to ask for your permission to state my opinion on some minor details in regard to the inscription.\n\n(1) Mr. V. A. Smith says that \"the final character of bhagavato looks like te, with a stroke to the left, but must be read either as to or ta.\" In my opinion, the word is bhagavate, and I do not see any reason for correcting this. For in M\u0101gadhi, P\u016bli bhagavato must become bhagavate, as the rule that final o changes to e holds good throughout.\n(2) sa bhaginikanam, if correct, would be very puzzling indeed, for the change of dental \\( n \\) to cerebral \\( n \\), though common enough in the literary Pr\u0101krits, is unknown to epigraphical P\u0101li or M\u0101gadhi. But, from an examination of the original urn, I can confidently assert that what has been taken for the upper cross-bar of \\( ni \\) (\u0928\u093f), is merely a small particle of stone peeled off when the writer engraved the \\( i-m\u0101tr\u0101 \\) of \\( ni \\). Hardly any photograph or impression will show this clearly, but on the original urn there remains no doubt whatever.\n\n(3) I am glad to confirm the correctness of the reading saputa, instead of Mr. Smith's saputra, pointed out by you in a foot-note. Mr. Smith probably has been misled by the fact that one stroke of \\( t \\) is prolonged a little down below the bottom line of the letter, thus \\( t \\). But, if this be \\( r \\), it ought to be a serpentine line, and not a straight down-stroke, as, e.g., we have \\( dra \\) in one of the Bharhat Stupa inscriptions.\n\nMy reading of the inscription, from the original, accordingly stands thus:\n\n\\[\n\\text{yanam}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{iyam salilanidhane budhasa bhagavate saki sukittibhatinam}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{sabbaginikanam saputadalananam.}\n\\]\n\nThis inscription is in one line only, round the hemispherical lid of the urn, with the exception of the two syllables yanam, which stand above suki.\u2014I have the honour to be, sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nT.

The Gosinga Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi MS.\n\nAs our readers are aware, fragments of an old birch bark MS. in Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi characters found their way in 1896 to Paris and St. Petersburg. The MS. was found about\nthirteen miles from Khotan, at or near the site of the ancient Gosinga Vih\u0101ra, and is the earliest known Indian MS. M. Senart has published in the *Journal Asiatique* facsimiles of the seven leaves which, together with numerous fragments, form the Paris portion of this important discovery; and has added to the great services he has rendered to the reconstruction of Indian history by a masterly decipherment of the contents of these leaves, with numerous valuable notes.\n\nThe little work is an anthology, a Dhammapada, a collection of religious verses. From what sources was the collection made? As is well known, there is a similar anthology included, under the name Dhammapada, in the Buddhist canon. M. Senart has shown that the majority of the verses included in this new collection are found also in the old one, but not in the same order, or in the same connection; and that a number of others in the new MS. are not in the older collection at all. This would seem to point to the supposition that the new anthology has not been compiled from the P\u0101li one; but rather from the sources from which the latter was itself compiled.\n\nBesides M. Senart's references I have noted the following:\n\n11. 4 Sutta Nip\u0101ta, 333, and Thera G\u0101th\u0101, 653, 1005.\n11. 5 Milinda, 379.\n15. 2 The MSS. of the DhP. read often H\u012bna-Dhamma\u1e41.\n16. 4 Sa\u1e41yutta, 1. 157; Divy\u0101vad\u0101na, 300; Milinda, 245; Netti, p. 41 of my MS.\n17. 5 Thera G\u0101th\u0101, 257.\n18. 7 J\u0101taka, 5. 72.\n19. 1 Thera G\u0101th\u0101, 676.\n20. 2, 3 ,, ,, 677\u20138.\n21. 6 Milinda, 213.\n25. 12 J\u0101taka, 5. 99.\n26. 14 Thera G\u0101th\u0101, 883.\n\n1 The figures on the right give the page and verse of the tirage \u00e0 part of M. Senart's paper.\nProfessor Oldenbourg, of St. Petersburg, is editing the other and larger portion of this Gosinga MS.; and when we have the whole text before us we may be able to draw some more certain conclusion as to the probable method of its compilation. At present it is uncertain whether the compiler translated into his native dialect from the Pitakas, or whether he drew from previous translations of the Pitaka books, or whether he translated from one or other of the other anthologies, different from the P\u0101li Dhammapada, which (from the lists of books extant in China or Tibet) we know must have existed in the centuries preceding the Christian era. As the MS. comes from a district afterwards predominantly Mah\u0101y\u0101nist, it is interesting to note the fact that it contains no trace of Mah\u0101y\u0101na doctrine.\n\nT. W. Rhys Davids.\n7. The Theory of Soul and the Initiative of the Avesta.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014With regard to Professor Mills' paper on the Avesta, and your own on the Upanishads, will you allow me to make the following observations.\n\nAgainst M. Darmesteter's later views as to the age of the Avesta may be urged\u2014firstly, the archaic nature of the language of the book, many of the G\u0101th\u0101s differing little from pure Sanskrit; and secondly, the fact that the parallelisms between Vedic and Avestic thought are found precisely in those passages of the Avesta and the Rig-Veda which, alike by Iranian and Indian scholars, are admitted to be the oldest. I refer especially to such as deal with ethical concepts, with Rita and Asha, Riju and Ratu, Vrijin\u0101 and Vareza, and to those G\u0101th\u0101s and S\u016bktas which represent the moral aspects of the \u0100dityas and Amesha Sp\u0113ntas.\n\nAs to the absorbing question of Zarathustra, despite all that has been said to the contrary, there seems little reason to doubt that he was born at Ragha, not far from T\u012br\u0101n, and appeared as the prophet of Magism under King Vist\u0101spa. Amongst future chroniclers there will doubtless be sceptics who will contend that the great English statesman who has lately left the sphere of his labours was but a pillar of Hercules or the Stone of the glory of Heaven ('Hpa\u014b\u03bb\u014bs=Svarga\u015bravas), and this by the same arguments as Prof. Kern seeks to show that the Iranian prophet was only a humanized Hesperus!\n\nTurning now to your own article, may I venture to suggest that it would have been helpful had you in each case given us the Sanskrit term to which you referred. We find at least four equivalents of 'soul' in the Upanishads, namely, j\u012bva, s\u016bksma-\u015barira, puru\u1e63a, and \u0101tman. All friends of folklore will be particularly grateful for the mode of dealing with the subject adopted by you. And though my own interest in these ancient treatises is for the most part a philosophical one, I should like, from your standpoint, to institute a comparison between the Upanishad doctrine and that of the Avesta.\nThe words used to express 'soul' in the Avesta are five: Fravashi, usht\u0101na, aghva, baodha\u011fh, and urvan.\n\nOf the first of these, namely, Fravashi, there is no exact counterpart in the Upanishads, though in some respects it may be compared with s\u016bksma-savira. Phonetically it is equivalent to praviddhi, and would seem to indicate the expansion of the supreme spiritual principle. It is the spiritual archetype of every man, without beginning and without end, attaching itself to the body at birth, wholly independently of urvan and baodha\u011fh, and leaving it at death. There is a mystical utterance about children in the New Testament which may well remind us of the Fravashis. The Master said: \"Their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.\"\n\nThe term usht\u0101na (== Skr. utth\u0101na) is the vital principle which maintains the functional activities of the senses, and corresponds to j\u012bva. It is an enlargement of ushta, 'health, well-being, salvation,' from \u221asta and ud, and implies full enjoyment of all the faculties. In close conceptual relationship to this is the word aghva, which is the Bactrian form of asu, and sometimes means self, but oftener the seat of life, as pr\u0101na is used in the Upanishads.\n\nBaodha\u011fh is partly vij\u00f1\u0101na and partly manas, but in either case it represents man's psychical force and nature.\n\nLastly, we have urvan, which expresses the characterizing individuality, the consciousness of responsibility in man. At death the Urvan has to give account of itself on the Cinvad bridge, and, according to the verdict of the Judges, goes either to heaven or to hell. The word comes from \u221avar, 'to wish, choose,' so that we should not be far wrong in describing it as the faculty of volition. In the Avesta there is a great deal about the Geus Urvan or Animal Soul. The song contained in the 29th Ha of the Yasna consists of a dialogue between Geus Urvan (Goshurun), the Ox-Soul, the personification of life, here appearing as the guardian of all things living, on the one side, and Ahura and Asha on the other. The soul of the ox complains to the Creator of the persecution suffered by all creatures here below at\nthe hands of demons; whereupon Ahura Mazda turns to Asha for advice on the subject. The latter then declares that he himself is supreme ruler and Lord of all, but there is no consolation until Ahura Mazda announces to Goshurun the coming of Zarathustra. Though not wholly satisfied with this, Goshurun nevertheless thenceforth submits to the will of Ahura.\n\nIn conclusion, it is worthy of note that, among other Vedic and Avestic contrasts, whereas according to the Upanishad doctrine the soul when in deep sleep goes into Starga or Brahma-loka (heaven), according to Zoroastrian lore it goes into acisto aghus (hell), because in the one case sleep is attributed to the Good Spirit and in the other to the Bad.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nHerbert Baynes.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n[Mr. Baynes raises a large question. Dissatisfaction with the ordinary soul theory led, no doubt, in widely separated countries, to its being supplemented by other theories. In India, also, there were such other theories, and about 1,500 years after the date of the books I was discussing these were worked up into an elaborate system by \u015aa\u1e45kara. If in the Avesta similar theories had already been worked up into a similarly elaborate system, that would be very suggestive as to the date of the Avesta. Of the five Avesta words explained by Mr. Baynes, only urvan seems to belong to the soul theory proper. It would be very interesting, if documents are available, to have a history of all five; and also of the four Indian terms referred to. The s\u016bksma-sarira was not born till many centuries after the time I was dealing with. J\u012bva does occur at that time in the sense of \u2018alive, living\u2019; or, as substantive, \u2018life.\u2019 Jacob gives five passages from the Ch\u0101ndogya and one from the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka. In none of them does the word mean \u2018soul\u2019; in three of them the reference is to a tree. Puru\u1e63a occurs frequently in the sense of \u2018man, human.\u2019 The word whose meaning I discussed was \u0101tman.\u2014Rh. D.]\n8. Early Commerce between India and Babylon.\n\nMr. Kennedy concludes his learned and valuable article on this interesting topic (above, 1898, p. 273) with a discussion as to the date of the knowledge of the monsoons, and with the remark that \"the true trade route to India\u2014that is, from Persia\u2014was discovered when the black-hulled merchant ships first plunged through the salt sea spray and ploughed their eastward course, under the stars, amid the open ocean.\"\n\nIn preparing my forthcoming translation of the Dialogues of the Buddha, I have come across the following passage in the Kevaddhu or Kevattua Sutta of the Digha (fifth century B.C.). The Buddha says:\n\n\"Long ago ocean-going merchants were wont to plunge forth upon the sea, on board a ship, taking with them a shore-sighting bird. When the ship was out of sight of land they would set the shore-sighting bird free. And it would go to the East and to the South and to the West and to the North, and to the intermediate points, and rise aloft. If on the horizon it caught sight of land, thither it would go. But if not, then it would come back to the ship again. Just so, brother, etc.\"\n\nSuch a simile would scarcely be made use of, in ordinary talk, unless the habit referred to were of some standing, and matter of general knowledge. It is, I think, the earliest reference in Indian books to ocean-going ships out of sight of land.\n\nT. W. Rhys Davids.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nProfessor G. Dalman. Die Worte Jesu, mit Ber\u00fccksichtigung des nachkannonischen juedischen Schriftthumsund der Aramaeischen Sprache. Vol. I: Einleitung und wichtige Begriffe, nebst Anhang. Messianische Texte. (Hinrichs: Leipzig, 1899.)\n\nIn this work, of which the first volume has just appeared, Professor Dalman is making practical use of the extensive Aramaic studies which he has pursued hitherto with such singleness of purpose and success. It appears now that they were merely the preparatory work, the scaffolding for a totally different structure. All these philological researches had, as their ultimate aim, the purpose to penetrate behind the Greek form of the words and the statements ascribed directly to Jesus, chiefly in the three Synoptic Gospels, and to recover, if possible, by means of an accurate study of the language spoken in Palestine the very original form of those sentences of Jesus. Did he speak Hebrew or Aramaic? Which of these two would explain more easily the peculiarities of the Greek forms, and which would give a more accurate meaning to those words as used by Jesus? This question, which is bound to touch upon extremely delicate theological problems, and is of incalculable importance for the criticism of the Synoptics, can be dealt with in these pages only and solely from the strictly philological point of view. Needless to say that the prominent feature of this first volume, dealing with the Introduction and some of the \"Principal Notions\" in\nthe Gospels, is to prove that the language spoken by Jesus was not Hebrew, as has been suggested by many great scholars, the last of whom is Resch, whose great work on this very question has just appeared, but the Aramaic of Galilee. Only, if retranslated into that special dialect, many of the forms and terms used obtain a clear and precise meaning. Such is the contention of Professor Dalman, who, with extreme learning and profound acumen, discusses seriatim each of these notions, and tries to retrace the original Aramaic form. There are a few points, however, which remain unanswered. The ground for assuming the language of the people to have been Aramaic in Palestine in the time of Jesus is not convincing. The fact remains that the language of the Prayers and the language of the Literature at that period was purely Hebrew, though of a somewhat different character from that of the Bible. A nation that speaks at one and the same time two languages is an ethnographical fiction. It is not likely that the people should have accepted a totally different language for their religious and another for their daily life, except in cases where the sacred literature had been introduced from elsewhere, as is the case with the Latin in the Catholic Church of Europe. The literature of the people would represent much more that language, and such is the case with the literature of the contemporaries of Jesus. Assuming, then, the literary language to have been Hebrew, how is it, then, that the primitive Gospel, also a literary product, should not have been written in the sacred Hebrew language, but in Aramaic? And if the three Synoptics have translated a Semitic original into Greek, have they not stood under the same influences under which the translators of the LXX stood, and was not the 'Koin\u0113' used in Palestine, a kind of Greeko-Semitic language, and which would thus not prove much for the original form of the language, either of the Primitive Gospel or of Jesus himself. Professor Dalman himself has to admit such influences when he tries to explain certain Hebraisms in the language of Luke. He says that Luke stood under the influence of\nthe Greek translation of the Bible. But as Professor Dalman refers constantly to the Hebrew forms of words and the notions prevalent at that period, as retained in the oldest texts of rabbinical literature, and supplies his Aramaic examples with very numerous parallels, he facilitates the critical examination of his thesis. He brings to bear to his task an unrivalled knowledge, at first hand, of these languages and literatures. The retranslation of whole sentences into Aramaic must, however, be declared as laboured and artificial, whilst the examinations and elucidations of the \"Principal Notions\" are models of accurate and profound investigation, full of keen insight into the spiritual life of the people of that period and of extreme value from a philological point of view. The supplement consists of eleven texts, which, according to Professor Dalman, are of Messianic import, commencing with the Sibyllinian Oracles and finishing with an Aramaic hymn, which seems to me to be of comparatively modern date, originating probably from the circle that had gathered round the new kabbalistical school in Tiberias in the sixteenth century, where many such hymns were written in the same language. The so-called Palestinian recension of the Eighteen Benedictions is merely a local variant unsupported and practically contradicted by the mass of similar texts which have recently come to light among the fragments brought from Egypt. Nor do I understand the reason for adopting the vocalization of the Yemen MSS. for the other Hebrew texts when we have at least as perfect texts in old and excellent MSS. with the usual vocalization. Those MSS. vary also considerably between one another, and for that reason alone it would have been more advisable to retain the version which appears in the Liturgies of the known rites. A text, which I have been able to reconstruct, from Egyptian fragments as old as those from which the so-called Palestinian Version has been published\u2014all are of Palestinian origin for that\u2014differs considerably from the one published by Professor Dalman, and agrees much more with the oldest known\nversion, that of Saadya, of the beginning of the tenth century, if not older. Professor Dalman ought to have taken this as basis, and in a similar manner the Kaddish as given by Maimonides is at least as archaic in form and structure as any other known; moreover, the Yemen Liturgy has adopted this form from Maimonides. But, in spite of these deficiencies, the book stands as an important contribution to the literature of that period.\n\nM. G.\n\nECLIPSES OF THE MOON IN INDIA. By Robert Sewell. (London, 1898.)\n\nThis continuation of the \"Indian Calendar\" gives a list of the lunar eclipses from A.D. 300 to 1900, which will prove of great use to those who have to calculate or verify dates of Indian inscriptions. It is mainly based on Von Oppolzer's Canon der Finsternisse, but possesses a value of its own, inasmuch as Mr. Sewell, for the date of every eclipse, has given not only the week-day, but also the Hindu lunar month in which the eclipse took place (or will take place). This may best be shown by an example.\n\nThe Nanyaur\u0101 plate of Dha\u1e45gadeva mentions a lunar eclipse on Sunday, the 15th of the bright half of K\u0101rttika of the [Vikrama] year 1055. We know that this date must fall in either A.D. 997 or 998, and from Mr. Sewell's list we see, without any calculation, that there was a lunar eclipse on the 6th November, A.D. 998, which was a Sunday, and which did fall in the month K\u0101rttika. We also see from it that the eclipse was total, and from the times given (which have been taken from the Canon) we may say at once that the eclipse was visible everywhere in India.\n\nTo test the accuracy of Mr. Sewell's part of the work, I have recalculated the data given by him for about fifty lunar eclipses mentioned in Indian inscriptions, and have found only one instance where Mr. Sewell is wrong. The eclipse of Monday, the 9th October, A.D. 1139, which is mentioned in a plate of Govindacandra of Kanauj, took place in the month \u0100\u015bvina, not in K\u0101rttika.\nBesides the list of lunar eclipses, Mr. Sewell's new work contains some minor additions to the \"Indian Calendar,\" which it seems unnecessary to specify here.\n\nG\u00f6ttingen.\n\nF.

Volume I: \"To the Overthrow of the English in the Spice Archipelago.\" (Longmans, Green, & Co., 1899.)\n\nThe author tells us in his Introduction, that this book completes a task which has occupied thirty-four years of his life. The Archives of England, Portugal, and Holland have been consulted by him personally.\n\nThe book, presented by the author to the Society, is the first volume of a series, and has been published in the present year; the remaining volumes will follow. It is dedicated by permission to H.M. the Queen-Empress, and is illustrated by four maps:\n\n(1) General Map of India.\n(2) Ancient and Mediaeval Trade Routes to India.\n(3) The Indian Peninsula, Portuguese period.\n(4) The Eastern Archipelago.\n\nIn the ten chapters of this volume the history of British India is brought down from 1516 A.D., when the old trade routes from India to the West were closed by the barbarism of the newly-established Turkish Empire, to 1603; the end of the struggle between the English and Dutch, culminating in the tragedy of Amboyna.\n\nThere is much new material: there is a judicious absence of an attempt at literary brilliancy; there is a sweeping away of certain familiar historic delusions, which hitherto prevailed. A certain historical philosophy dominates the narrative. The conquest of British India by the population of a little island in the extreme West is but the last scene of the great drama of the conflict between Asia and Europe, which had gone on for centuries long before the Christian era.\nGreat Britain endured much during a century and a half of struggle, ere it entered into its inheritance. \"Qui dura vince\" is an Italian proverb, aptly illustrated in this case. If it be argued, that the conquest of India was the result of brute force, this is not denied, but there was persistent self-sacrifice as well on the part of the conquerors.\n\nThe author does not withhold well-deserved praise from the Portuguese and their leaders; they were noble fellows, but the political resources and population of Portugal did not form a sufficiently large basis for so magnificent a structure as an Asiatic Empire.\n\nAs Portugal disappeared, Holland appeared on the scene, and her resources also proved insufficient for the task.\n\nIn these pages there is an absence of Chauvinism and Egoism, which often degrade the modern history of any particular country, written for the benefit of so-called patriotic readers; a judicial spirit reigns throughout, but one feature transpires, that the British authorities had even in those early days a care for the interests of the people committed to their charge, as is the case in British India to a remarkable extent at the present day. The Portuguese had no conception of the nature of the duty, which attended the task of ruling conquered provinces. The Dutch then, and now, looked upon Colonies and subject populations as the platform of a financial speculation, which must be made at any cost to bring profitable returns to the Mother-Country; they cared not for the advancement of the subject races.\n\nThe volume before us ends at a period, when the British prospects had fallen very low in the struggle with Holland, but it must be recollected that the bone of discord with Holland was not so much the Peninsula of India as the islands and coasts of the Indian Archipelago: the Dutch adventurers were supported by the whole strength of the Dutch Government; the British East India Company had to depend on its own resources. The author brings out the strong and weak features of the two contending nations, and with great success.\nWe look forward with great interest to the forthcoming second volume: we trust not to have to wait too long; it will bring the reader down the stream of time to a period, with the environment of which he is more familiar. It is well to study the genesis of Empires, as well as of Natural Phenomena. The Twentieth Century, into which we are entering, may develop organic dangers and the germ of decay of Empires, unheeded and unthought of by the surface-student of History. The question may be raised in Parliament, whether the Empire of India is worth retaining, if any prodigious sacrifice had to be made by the Mother-Country. The reply of an old Anglo-Indian official, who helped to extend the North-Western frontier from the Satlaj to the Indus and beyond, and to rule subject races firmly, yet sympathetically and lovingly, is, that if Great Britain by mischance, or misconduct, lost the Empire of India, it would cease to be one of the Great Powers of the World, and, following the example, fall to the political level of Spain.\n\nThe author suffered the great mortification of the loss of the main part of his materials and manuscripts collected in India, when the homeward-bound steamer, to which they were entrusted, went to the bottom of the sea, but his unflagging zeal and dauntless energy did not sink under this great calamity; to a certain extent he has modified the plan and scope of his enterprise, and we think wisely so.\n\nIn the first place, \"\u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\": the present work must consist of several large volumes: if the author had carried out his intention of \"preparing a complete history of India from the invasion of the Aryans\" (p. 18), the size of the work would have been indefinitely extended.\n\nIn the second place, what was the presumable date of the Aryan Invasion? Anterior to Alexander the Great, anterior to the birth of Buddha, which are dates fixed with tolerable certainty. The earliest date of the Book under review is 1516 A.D. The Birth of Buddha carries us back 2,100 years, and there is an abyss of centuries\nbeyond before we reach the possible and probable date of the Aryan Invasion. Besides, such a subject opens out a new and distinct world of ideas, facts, speculations, and doubts, and postulates an amount of peculiar study and accumulated knowledge not to be found in the fourteen fascinating volumes of the Imperial Gazetteer of India. No one is so familiar as the author with the physical, racial, and intellectual features of the three hundred Millions of British India of the Nineteenth Century after the Christian era, and we are glad that he has restricted the orbit of his labours into a compass, where we can trust him implicitly, and without a doubt. Our critical attitude would necessarily be modified, if in one of his volumes we had to consider the questions: At what date was the Phoenician Alphabet imported into India? What are the dates of certain Inscriptions, and Manuscripts? The Twentieth Century may bring a solution to this and other questions; the Nineteenth has not done so. The author's narrative floats down a stream of absolute historic calm and certainty: let him be satisfied.\n\nRobert Needham Cust,\nHon. Sec. of Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nMarch 10, 1899.\n\nParsee Prakash; being a record of important events in the growth of the Parsi community in Western India, chronologically arranged, from the date of their immigration into India to the year 1860 A.D. Compiled by Bomanjee Byramjee Patell. Gujarati. 4to; pp. xvi and 1052. (Bombay, 1888.)\n\nThis chronicle of the doings and progress of the Indian Parsis, so far as they have been recorded down to 1860, could have been compiled only by patient and enthusiastic research, and have been so conveniently arranged only by judicious appreciation and thorough knowledge of the wants of inquirers. Each event is briefly recorded, but with all necessary particulars, from the best available document and under its proper English date. And, if the document bears\na Parsi or Hindu date, that is also recorded; while the nature of the document and, sometimes, remarks as to its authenticity are added in footnotes. As the chronicle is intended chiefly for the information of the Parsi community, it is written in Gujar\u0101t\u012b; but the preface is also given in English, and the original text of English documents is often quoted in the footnotes.\n\nAmong the authorities quoted are printed and manuscript books, statements of old travellers, legal and government records, family papers, newspapers, riv\u0101yats, and inscriptions. Formerly it was the custom for priests to keep records of deaths and remarkable events occurring in their vicinity, or among their neighbours, but this class of record was never easily accessible, and is now supposed to be fast disappearing, so that it will probably be altogether lost if copies be not collected during the present generation.\n\nThis work was published originally in eleven parts, appearing at intervals extending over the ten years from 1878 to 1888. Including a supplement of additional information, which accumulated during the publication, the book records about 3,180 distinct events, and mentions the names of about 5,370 Parsi men and 360 Parsi women. It is also provided with a perfect index of subjects, and another of Parsi names, probably the most complete that exists.\n\nAs a specimen of this chronicle it will be sufficient to report its mode of dealing with some of the earlier events. It commences by recording the emigration of the first party of Parsis from Hormuz, at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, to the island of Diw, south of K\u0101thi\u0101war. This is stated on the authority of the Qissah-e Sanj\u0101n (completed 22nd November, 1599, o.s.), but no dates are mentioned, because those stated in that book are very uncertain. In the \u1e24\u0101des\u0101-n\u0101mu (Bombay, A.D. 1831) Dast\u016br Fr\u0101mji Aspandi\u0101rji Rab\u0101di quotes them as follows:\u2014The emigrants first fled into Kohist\u0101n, where they remained a century, and afterwards travelled to Hormuz, where they dwelt fifteen years, and then sailed to Diw, where they stayed nineteen years,\nand again sailed in stormy weather to Sanj\u0101n. Here they were permitted to settle by the Hind\u016b R\u0101j\u0101 J\u0101dir\u0101na, who granted them a considerable tract of land on certain conditions.\n\nThe date of their arrival is uncertain, but the footnotes state that the Rev. Dr. J. Wilson thought that the R\u0101j\u0101 might have been Jaydev, who reigned in Gujar\u0101t A.D. 745-806 (see Indian Antiquary, 1872). Though Dast\u016br Aspandi\u0101rji K\u0101mdinji, of Bharuc, in his Kadim T\u0101rikh P\u0101rsio-ni Kasr, p. 149 (A.D. 1826), states that the Parsis landed at Sanj\u0101n in Samvat 772, \u015ar\u0101van sud 9, on Friday the second day Bahman of the fourth month Tir, A.Y. 85; but in 1870 Seth K. R. K\u0101ma, in his Yazdajardi T\u0101rikh, showed that these two dates did not correspond. The Indian Parsi date, second day of fourth month A.Y. 85, was really Friday, 25th September, 716, but the Hindu date seems to have been two or three months earlier, and this discrepancy can hardly be explained as a mere copyist's blunder. In his supplement, p. 837, the compiler gives further information about this date; in an old copy of the Qissah-e Sanj\u0101n, among the records belonging to the Udv\u0101ra assembly, there was written, in Samvat 1372 (A.D. 1816), a memorandum that the day of the landing of the Parsia at Sanj\u0101n was Samvat 895, on the first day of the fourth month, on a Sunday. This date, the first of the fourth month, A.Y. 208 (Indian reckoning), was 24th August, A.D. 839, which day was really a Sunday. All that can be said for this latter date is that it is more reasonable than the former one.\n\nAs Parsi priests are accustomed to recite the names of their ancestors on certain occasions, it would seem an easy matter to ascertain the average number of generations by which the present priests are separated from any common ancestor; and this is no doubt the case when the interval is not more than four or five centuries; but further back this traditional memory is often imperfect. An extensive pedigree of the Bharuc Dast\u016brs and their posterity was compiled by one of their descendants born in 1838; and\nfrom this pedigree, with the assistance of some information contained in known colophons, it is possible to approximate to the date when Neriosang Dhawal (the Parsi priest who translated most of the Yasna and part of the Khurdah Avesta into Sanskrit) must have flourished; a matter which the compiler of the Parsi Prak\u0101sh has not attempted to decide.\n\nIn a colophon appended to the Pahlavi Y\u014dsht-i Fry\u0101no in Haug\u2019s MS. 6 at Munich, the copyist, Peshyotan R\u0101m K\u0101md\u012bn, writing in 1397, gives his pedigree for ten generations\u00b9 back to R\u0101my\u0101r, the father of Hormazdy\u0101r, who is generally recognized as the first cousin of Neriosang Dhawal. These ten generations, detailed in a document 500 years old, have been a valuable extension, or confirmation, of the oldest portion of the pedigree. Another colophon, appended to the P\u0101zand-Sanskrit Ard\u0101-V\u012braf in Haug\u2019s MS. 18 at Munich, was written by R\u0101m K\u0101md\u012bn, the father of the aforesaid Peshyotan, in 1410.\n\nThe pedigree itself informs us that Peshyotan was an ancestor of its compiler in the nineteenth generation, and that its compiler was born in 1838; while the colophons state that Peshyotan wrote one MS. in 1397, and his father R\u0101m wrote another in 1410. With these data it is easy to calculate the average length of a generation with great exactness. As nineteen generations of 24 years and 25 years would extend over 456 and 475 years respectively, or back from 1838 to 1382 and 1363 respectively, it is evident that the average generation must have been between these limits, and most probably about 24 years and 3 months, because in that case Peshyotan would have been 20 years old in 1397, and R\u0101m 57 years old in 1410; the son being just old enough to be trusted to copy Pahlavi MSS., and the father just young enough to write without spectacles, which were very rare anywhere in those days.\n\nReturning to the pedigree, corrected by the insertion of the three names accidentally omitted in the English translation\n\n\u00b9 All mentioned in the Pahlavi text, but three have been accidentally omitted in the English translation.\nof Peshyotan's colophon, we find that Hormazdy\u0101r, the first cousin or contemporary of Neriosang, lived eight generations earlier than R\u0101m, and eight generations of 24 years and 3 months take us back 194 years from the birth of R\u0101m in 1353 to the probable time of the birth of Hormazdy\u0101r, or of Neriosang, about A.D. 1159. This leads to the conclusion that the Yasna must have been translated into Sanskrit about A.D. 1200, when Neriosang may have been 41 years old. The pedigree mentions only three generations before Neriosang, so it begins about A.D. 1086 with Sheheriy\u0101r and his son Sh\u0101hpur, from whom most of the priestly families trace their descent. Many early priests have probably been omitted, but whether before or after these two names is quite uncertain.\n\nShortly after their arrival at Sanj\u0101n, the immigrant Parsis built a fire-temple, and furnished it with the necessary apparatus for worship, which they had brought with them from Khur\u0101s\u0101n. The date of its consecration, being doubtful, is given in a footnote as generally supposed to have been in Samvat 777, on the ninth day of the ninth month (A.Y.), which is a common mode of writing old dates in Indian Parsi MSS.; and this is the date on which its anniversary is still celebrated. But in some writings the 26th day of the second month is mentioned. These two dates are equivalent to 27th February, 721, and 18th August, 720, respectively.\n\nThe next events recorded are the visits of Parsis to the Kanheri Caves in Salsette, where they inscribed their names and the dates of their visits, in Pahlavi characters, nearly nine centuries ago. The dates given in the Parsee Prak\u0101sh are not quite accurate, as they were published before these inscriptions had been fully translated in the Indian Antiquary, vol. ix, pp. 265\u20138. There are four Pahlavi inscriptions still fairly legible, and, if the dates are inscribed according to Indian Parsi reckoning, they are as follows:\u2014The earliest inscription is unfinished, but gives the names of fifteen Parsis who had come to the place on the first day of the seventh month, A.Y. 378 (10th October, 1009). The second\ninscription (over a tank) gives a complete list of the same Parsis, with one additional, and is dated the 16th day of the eighth month, A.Y. 378 (24th November, 1009), probably the date of intended departure; but a second extra name is added, as if the person had died more than a fortnight later. Both these inscriptions must refer to one protracted visit. A third inscription, dated the 24th of the seventh month, A.Y. 390 (30th October, 1021), contains ten names, of which four also occur in the preceding inscriptions. The fourth inscription, on a stone found among the ruins of a built d\u0101goba, gives merely the year A.Y. 390 and the name M\u0101h-Farnbag, the first mentioned in the third inscription, being evidently a record of the same visit. The names resemble those used in the later Sasanian times, and for the next six centuries, by the Parsis in Persia.\n\nFrom Sanj\u0101n the Parsis spread to Bharuc, Khamb\u0101t, Aklesar, and other places in Gujar\u0101t; and, according to a memorandum in an old book about the inheritance of property belonging to the Maharji-R\u0101n\u0101 family, their ancestor K\u0101mdin Zarathosht arrived at N\u0101gmandal on the 24th of the first month, A.Y. 511 (3rd April, 1142). He remarked that its climate was like that of S\u0101ri in M\u0101zendar\u0101n, the home of his ancestors, and hence he called his new home Naws\u0101ri, or \u2018the new S\u0101ri.\u2019\n\nUnder the date A.D. 1184 a statement is quoted, from the preface to Westergaard\u2019s Zendavesta (1854), regarding an ancient colophon, found copied in the old Vendidad, with Pahlavi, at Copenhagen, from which it appears that a preceding copy of the same text was written in Sagast\u0101n, or S\u012bst\u0101n, for a Parsi priest named M\u0101hy\u0101r, from the district of Aucak, on the bank of the water of Sind (probably Uch in the Panj\u0101b), who had been six years in Sagast\u0101n, studying religious matters for his friends in India, and was about to return home with the information he had collected and this copy of the Vendidad, presented as a righteous gift. The epoch from which the date of this colophon was reckoned is not mentioned, but as we have only a copy of a copy of the original colophon, the epoch was probably\nomitted by one of the copyists. The Iranian Parsi calendar completes its year thirty days earlier than the Indian one, and in old dates the years were usually reckoned in Iran from the death of Yazdakard, that is, from A.Y. 20. The date given in the colophon is the 17th of the fourth month of 554, and this would be 16th May, 1185, if reckoned from Yazdakard's accession, or 11th May, 1205, if reckoned from his death. Nothing further appears to be known of this colony of Parsis which existed at Uch in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\n\nMany priestly families are next traced to their ancestors in the footnotes; and the building of a brick dokhmu at Bharuc, by Seth Peshatanji, is mentioned as being recorded in an old book by a bard of Baroda. The date given is Samvat 1365, Jeth sud 2 (A.D. 1309); and the dokhmu appears to be still standing, though in a ruinous condition.\n\nOne of many documents, found in a collection of manuscript papers in the Meharji-Ran library at Nawsari, is an affidavit, signed by twenty-six Parsi laymen of Valsar, certifying that they had obtained a resident priest from the Nawsari assembly. This document is dated Samvat 1471, Vaisakh sud 11 (A.D. 1414).\n\nShortly after this, Sultan Mahmud Begara, of Ahmadabad, sent his kinsman Alafkhan, with a force of 3,000 men, to attack Sanjan, whose Raja induced the Parsis to assist him with 1,400 men, under a leader named Ardeshir, who at first defeated the Musulmans; but the latter, being reinforced, afterwards defeated the Parsis, killed Ardeshir, and captured Sanjan. These events are mentioned only in the Qissah-e Sanjan, and their date is doubtful, but the compiler, in his footnotes, gives reasons for placing them in the interval, 1458\u20131493, and probably near the beginning of it.\n\nThe same uncertain authority states that the surviving Parsis fled from Sanjan, with their families and sacred fire, into the hills of Bahrot, where they remained twelve years, and then moved into the Vansra jungle for fourteen years longer, after which Cangha Asa, the chief Parsi layman at Nawsari, induced them to take their sacred fire to Nawsari.\nand settle there. An old Yasna, written at Naws\u0101ri, A.D. 1658, was copied at Vals\u0101r, A.D. 1800, and in this copy it is stated that the Sanj\u0101n sacred fire arrived at Naws\u0101ri on the 29th of the sixth Parsi month, in S\u0101rvat 1475 (28th June, 1419), which is not easy to reconcile with the preceding dates, and is probably not based upon a contemporary record, but upon mere tradition. The compiler of the Parsee Prak\u0101sh, however, suggests (in p. 5, note 2) a means of approximately ascertaining the true date of the arrival of the Sanj\u0101n fugitives at Naws\u0101ri by reference to information contained in the earliest Persian Riv\u0101yats still extant. These Persian Riv\u0101yats contain religious information and epistles, from Parsi priests in Persia, addressed to Parsis in India, in reply to written inquiries which the latter sent to Persia by special messengers from time to time. The earliest Riv\u0101yats, of which copies are known to survive, were two brought back to India by N\u0101rem\u0101n Hoshang, from the vicinity of Yazd, in 1478\\(^1\\) and 1486,\\(^1\\) and a Kit\u0101bat or epistle brought from the same neighbourhood, by four Iranian Parsi traders, in 1511.\\(^1\\) In all three documents Cangah-sh\u0101h is mentioned as the chief layman at Naws\u0101ri, and a Herbad Khursh\u0113d, mentioned in the first Riv\u0101yat as an important priest at Naws\u0101ri, is further defined as Khursh\u0113d of Sanj\u0101n in the other two documents. Both parties were evidently resident in Naws\u0101ri for fully thirty-three years, but neither name is found in the next Riv\u0101yat, written in 1527. From this we learn that an important priest from Sanj\u0101n had arrived at Naws\u0101ri before 1478, and it is known that Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd came into power at Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d in 1458, so that the capture of Sanj\u0101n must have been after that date. If we suppose that the Parsis were driven out of Sanj\u0101n about 1460, and took refuge at Naws\u0101ri about 1470, they would have dwelt ten years in the jungly hills, instead of the legendary twenty-six. This\n\n\\(^1\\) These are the dates if reckoned from the accession of Yazdakard, but they would each be twenty years later if reckoned from his death, in which case the fugitives may have remained in the jungle for the full traditional period of twenty-six years, say from 1460 to 1486.\noccasional correspondence with the Iranian Parsis continued for more than another century, and has contributed several lists of Indian Parsi names to the compiler's chronicle.\n\nThe first Parsi who settled in Bombay was Dorabji N\u0101n\u0101bh\u0101\u012b, who came from Sum\u0101ri-g\u0101m at Surat, A.D. 1640, and remained in the service of the Portuguese authorities; being afterwards employed by the English to collect a tax levied on the cooly fishermen. He was the ancestor of the K\u0101wasji Patel family, and died in 1689. His younger son, Rustamji Dorabji, succeeded to his father's appointment, and in 1692, when all the Europeans and garrison were dying from a severe pestilence, and the Sidi of Janjira had landed troops and taken the Duagari Fort, he collected a number of cooly fishermen, and drove the enemy out of the island, which he held for a few days, till the arrival of reinforcements from Surat. For this good service the Patelship of Bombay was made hereditary in his family. He died on the 27th of the sixth month, A.Y. 1132 (11th April, 1764), aged 96, having been one of the principal members of the original Parsi Pancayat from its commencement.\n\nRegarding Rustamji's wife and her family a tale, worthy of romance, is told under the date A.D. 1808. Her parents were Siyavakhsh bin Dinyar and his wife Firangij, Iranian Parsis who had been forcibly converted to the Musulman faith. They had two daughters, whom they had secretly brought up as Zoroastrians, and were intending to send them for marriage to the Parsis residing in India, when a German traveller appeared, who was a very respectable man; so Siyavakhsh begged his assistance, and proposed to intrust him with his daughters, for conveyance to India and delivery to some trustworthy Parsi there, who would undertake to have them married. The German offered to marry one of the girls himself, and to deliver the other as requested. To this the girls and their parents assented, and the former travelled to Bombay with the German. Thence the German took one girl with him to his own country, leaving the other with a respectable Parsi shopkeeper, to give away\nin marriage to some Parsi householder. His choice fell upon Rustamji Dorabji, to whom the girl, named Firoj\u0101, was married. She had four sons, three of whom died before her, at ages varying from 37 to 55; and she survived her husband nearly 44 years, dying on the 11th of the fifth month, A.Y. 1177 (15th February, 1808), aged 80. It is rare for the combined lives of a man and his wife to extend into three centuries, as in this case, beginning in 1677 and ending in 1808, a period of 131 years; but the husband must have been 60 years older than his wife. From the age of the eldest son, at the time of his death, it is easy to see that the marriage took place in 1743, which is one step towards identifying the German traveller, if he were a man of any importance.\n\nThese desultory remarks will be sufficient to show that Mr. B. B. Patell has succeeded in collecting much valuable historical information regarding the Indian Parsis, which he should endeavour to extend and improve as opportunity offers. Wherever old and trustworthy documents survive, the influential Parsis should assist him to obtain permission to inspect them and note their contents for future compilation. He has nearly exhausted the documents with which I am acquainted, but some remaining information may be mentioned.\n\nPerhaps the oldest document in India, containing a contemporary record of Parsi names, was one of the copperplates of the Kottayam grant, made to the Syrian Church by a local R\u0101j\u0101 in Travancore, probably early in the ninth century A.D., a facsimile of which was published in J.R.A.S., o.s., Vol. VII, p. 344. Fortunately this facsimile is fairly legible, as the plate, bearing the names of the witnesses, is said to be now lost. Ten of these witnesses signed their names in cursive Pahlavi, and all call themselves Magav\u014dk\u014d,\n\n---\n\n1 The compiler has probably found these facts recorded in family papers, and not in any newspaper, as supposed by M. D. Menant in his recent book entitled Les Parsis. In the Parsee Prak\u0101sh there are two footnotes, referring to the Bombay Courier for other events recorded on the same page as this tale, with which latter they have no connection; and the Bombay Courier for 1808 has been searched in vain for any reference to this tale.\nor Magian. The cursive character of the writing makes the names difficult to decipher, but the following translation is probably nearly correct:\n\n\"I, the Magian (Magar\u014dk\u014d) Yakr\u0101no-r . . . -shifas, son of Shik\u014dn-zar\u012br, am a witness.

It is only within the last few years that the name of the man to whom the Parsis owe the preservation of the Pahlavi Yasna, Vendidad, and some other miscellaneous texts, has been discovered in some old MSS. His name was C\u0101hil, son of S\u0101ngan, a Parsi layman of Khamb\u0101t, probably a trader, who must have died before A.D. 1323, after providing for two copies of each of the texts above mentioned, as a good work. A rozn\u0101mah is also appended to two of the colophons, mentioning the names of six of his ancestors and other dead relations, and the dates when they should each be kept in remembrance.\n\nA complete list of copyists and their ancestors, with approximate dates for each name, might be both interesting and useful; and abundance of such materials accumulate in\nthe course of time. The Persian Riv\u0101yats have been nearly exhausted, so far as names of Indian Parsis are concerned; but they also contain long lists of Iranian Parsis living at certain times, and some attempts at estimating their numbers.\n\nMarch, 1899. E. W. West.\n\nThe Chronology of India, from the Earliest Times to the beginning of the Sixteenth Century. By C. Mabel Duff (Mrs. W. R. Rickmers). (Archibald Constable and Co., 1899.)\n\nThis remarkable compilation possesses the qualities which such a book should possess\u2014a clear and well-considered plan steadily adhered to, a matured presentment of the matters entered, an informed selection of the authorities. A work on Chronology to be of use must, on its own merits, command respect and confidence as to general accuracy, and to my mind there is no doubt that Miss Duff's book (to give the author her best-known name) is entitled to both. The methods adopted for ensuring accuracy are unimpeachable, and the sources of information as nearly so as existing conditions admit. The references to the authorities are ubiquitous and of the highest value. The list of those who have actively assisted the author is of itself a guarantee of the care, knowledge, and research brought to bear on the subject.\n\nThe general plan of the work is \"a table of events in chronological order\" of ascertained facts and dates only, supplemented by an extremely valuable Appendix, consisting of Lists of Indian Dynasties, in which are included all the known names of the kings, with the dates of those only, as to whom positive information is available. There are also collated lists of the Pauranic Dynasties\u2014\u015aa\u015bun\u0113ga, Maurya, \u015au\u1e45ga, Kanva, Andhrabhritya. These Lists and Tables are made to work in together, so as to form a kind of index of dates to each other, in a highly commendable manner. In addition, there is a very long, complete, and most laborious index to the whole work.\nTo say that such a book supplies a need, and will be of assistance to students, is to put the case too mildly, as it will, on account of its carefulness and completeness within its limits, be of inestimable value to those whose studies take them into matters connected with Indian history, and will save them an infinite amount of troublesome and thankless search in the verification of details; for Miss Duff's admirable industry and patience have not only now placed the desired facts within easy reach, but have also supplied the necessary references to the authorities, by which her statements can be readily verified. One student, at any rate, of things Indian, tenders her his hearty thanks in anticipation for much future trouble saved.\n\nThe preface hints at the present work being intended only as a preliminary edition, and, though no one could wish to compel an author to undertake so great and so careful a labour, as is involved in the book before us, more than once in a lifetime, one cannot but hope that should research, current and to come, cause, as it ought, another edition to early succeed the present one, the work will fall to the competent hand so successful on this occasion. But whenever the time comes for such another edition, it is to be hoped that, just as the Sinhalese Chronology has been now introduced as germane to the Indian, circumstances will have rendered it possible to introduce the Burmese also. The connection of the various Burmese and Peguan Dynasties with, at least, Buddhist India was much closer than many suspect, and the present writer feels convinced that an intimate study of Burmese Chronology will serve to throw light on that of early India. The epigraphic data available for the purpose are quite as numerous and trustworthy as those for India, and the vernacular literary data are also very many and far from untrustworthy. Unfortunately, both these sources of correct information still await the attention of competent students.\n\nThis is one direction in which Miss Duff's labours might in future be enlarged with advantage, should the state of research permit. Here is another. The Chand Dynasty of\nKumaun, the K\u0101\u1e45gr\u0101 Dynasty, and some N\u0113p\u0101l\u012b Dynasties are given in the Appendix. There are genealogies existing in MS., which should be procurable through the political agencies, of Chamb\u0101, Jamm\u016bn, N\u0101han, and many another Himalayan 'kingdom,' the value of which, when historical inquiries are necessary, can be demonstrated by a reference to the prefaces of the various semi-historical tales from the Hills to be found in the Legends of the Panjab. I once had, even if I have not now, put away in some forgotten place of safety, authentic vernacular copies of several of these in my own possession: and if I recollect rightly, some of them found a corner in Panjab Notes and Queries. All such lists require a good deal of verification, of course, but, though the facts they purport to relate truly might never find their way into the Tables, they might be usefully included in the Lists of the Appendix.\n\nAs to the limits that the author has imposed upon herself, personally I should like to see the work continued on to the year 1700 A.D. or thereabouts, so as to include the chief facts of the earlier European struggles in India.\n\nWith these remarks and hints, thrown out for what they may be worth, I take leave of one of the most praiseworthy efforts at the compilation of a good book of reference it has been my fortune to come across.\n\nR. C. Temple.\n\nThe Booklet of Counsels. (Urmi, 1898.)\n\nIt is desirable to call attention to this work, modestly called the \"Booklet of Counsels,\" recently issued by the Men of the Archbishop's Mission to Assyrian Christians, in Syro-Armenian characters. Its purpose is to provide the Syrians with a series of characteristic selections from their classical literature, embracing the earliest as well as the latest authors. The editors have laid several printed books under contribution, but they have also published many new texts and introduced Syriac scholars to new authors. Nearly every extract is preceded by a brief notice in Syriac\nof the author's life, and, where there are unusual expressions, accompanied by notes. As is customary with texts printed in the Nestorian character, the extracts have been fully vocalized, and the editors have come well through the test to which this process has submitted their scholarship. There are few or no misprints.\n\nThere is no reason why this book should not be used as a Chrestomathy in Europe, and the quantity and diversity of the matter make it compare very favourably with any that has been issued. There are many new specimens in it of artificial poetry, a form of composition illustrated in Cardahi's *Liber Thesauri*, which, however, having the comments in Arabic, is not accessible to many readers. There is a considerable extract from the *Scholia* of Theodore Bar Kunai, a work of which M. Pognon in the recently published second part of his \"Coupes de Khouabir\" has published another fragment; the Urmi extract contains a harmony of apparent discrepancies in the Gospels. For the date and probable sources of this writer M. Pognon's work should be consulted. There are some new Homilies of Isaac of Nineveh and of Narsai; extracts from unpublished works of Yohannan Bar Zu'bai, Yohannan of Mausil, Ishak Eshbednaya, 'Amanuel Malfana, Simon of Shanklabad, Elias of Anbar, and others; while in one or two cases the extracts given appear almost simultaneously with the publication of the original, e.g. in the case of the extract from the *Ethikon* of Barhebraeus, the whole of which has recently been published by Bedjas, accompanied by the *Liber Columbae*, which, curiously, appeared about the same time in Rome. It is to be feared that even this new accession to Syriac literature will do little to save it from the charge of \"mediocrity,\" levelled against it by Dr. Wright; but the editors, Messrs. Jenks and Irving, have accomplished a work which reflects great credit on themselves, their press, and their mission.\n\nD. S. Margoliouth.\nFirst Steps in Assyrian. By L. W. King, M.A., Assistant in the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities, British Museum. pp. 538. (Kegan Paul, Trench, & Co. 15s.)\n\nEvery intelligent attempt to extend the knowledge and deepen the interest of English students in Assyrian and Babylonian Archaeology deserves a cordial welcome. The subject is too large and too important to be treated by its experts in any kind of 'close-corporation' spirit. With 100,000 tablets in our own National Museum, the tens of thousands elsewhere, and further additions being continually made to these stores, our present number of readers cannot possibly keep pace with their work. The Deluge Tablet sent home by Mr. Rassam had lain unrecognized for years until it came under the notice of the late Mr. Geo. Smith. The Chedorlaomer Tablets for sixteen or eighteen years had attracted no special attention until Mr. Pinches discovered their contents. What further surprises of a similar character await us, who can divine? Moreover, there is urgent need for an immediate renewal of the work of excavation by our own countrymen; others are moving whilst our hands are slack, and Arabs are plundering and destroying. To facilitate the study of Cuneiform is therefore to render to every branch of the subject as it stands service of the utmost value, and to prepare the way for future work.\n\nMr. King's book is in many respects admirable, and supplies a genuine need. It is, as he describes it, \"A Book for Beginners,\" and he has done well both in making a plentiful use of the script and in exemplifying plentifully by its aid various important points of grammar. It is perhaps the general excellency of the work and its adaptation to the end proposed which excite the greater attention to its defects. One cannot help asking why in a \"book for beginners\" the bulk should have been so swelled out, and the cost proportionately increased? We have only 70 pages of actual grammar out of a total of\n588 pages, while with Sign-list, Vocabulary, etc., we have only 222 pages. The remainder is the \"Reading Book,\" containing forty-two fully transliterated and translated texts, and a few texts not so treated. The proportion of texts is excessive, with so large a number accessible on every hand, and must have more than doubled the expense of publication. Moreover, all the texts are in the Assyrian character, which is most unfortunate. If we had had a few Babylonian texts in the Babylonian character, with the Assyrian equivalents given where difficulty was likely to be experienced, it would have greatly increased the value of the book by introducing the student to a wider range of Cuneiform literature; but to put Hammurabi's language in Assurbanipal's script is an inexcusable anachronism, if not an absurdity.\n\nWith reference to the Grammar, it is difficult to understand upon what principle the moods and tenses of the verb are jumbled together into one. We are told that \"The Assyrian verb possesses five tenses: the Preterite, the Present, the Imperative, the Participle, the Permansive, and the Infinitive\"; and after learning that the Imperative and Infinitive are tenses, we get the contradictory statement that \"the Permansive expresses a state or condition.\" It is much to be regretted also that the bad precedent of previous writers should have been followed in the treatment of the paradigm of the verb. Why should we not have had at least one verb given completely and in the original script? What Hebrew tutor would think of giving his students the Kal conjugation alone, and leaving them with only a few hints to fill up the rest as best he could? With nothing but Mr. King's book it is very doubtful whether any 'beginner' would be able to write out even the simplest of the regular Assyrian verbs in full. Surely a little more type and space here would have been well employed.\n\nIt would seem indeed as if Mr. King was in too much hurry to get his work off his hands. He is a busy man, no doubt, and others have to suffer for it. But a little more deliberation would not only have prevented certain\nneedless repetitions and other blemishes in his English, but enabled him to bestow more pains on the arrangement of the Vocabulary, and to improve on the arrangements of his predecessors. If we must have our Vocabularies and Lexicons arranged according to the order of the Hebrew letters, then why should \u05d0 stand before \u05d1 (albeit \u05d0 may be understood as a vowel), and \u05d9 before \u05d0? Or if according to the order of the English letters, why should ai\u0331u stand before abu, and abbutu before abalu? As things are, our Lexicographers follow neither order, and our Lexicons are in inextricable confusion. Mr. King is not to be blamed for the precedents he has followed, although it is to be regretted that it should not have occurred to him to break with them and to set a new precedent, especially in a book for beginners. This alphabetical difficulty created by our Lexicographers is further increased by the practice of placing each derived word under its supposed root\u2014a practice which cannot be consistently observed, because the root of every word is not certainly known. Mr. King has wisely endeavoured to mitigate the inconvenience it occasions by placing the word in some cases in its alphabetical position and referring the student to the other place for its meaning. But the practice itself has hardly anything to commend it, and would be better entirely abandoned.\n\nThe fact is that these confused arrangements are at bottom sheer pedantry. The impossibility of following consistently any order excepting that of the English equivalents of the Assyrian syllabary appears on every page of every vocabulary or lexicon in which the attempt is made. Mr. King attests it by feeling compelled to place words with the initial vowels \u2018E,\u2019 \u2018I,\u2019 and \u2018U\u2019 between the letters \u05d0 and \u05d1: hence we have Alephs, H\u0113s, Waws, Cheths, Yodhs, and Ayins all mixed up together. A vocabulary or lexicon is necessarily chiefly used to find the meanings of words we do not recognize, and when once the value of the first Cuneiform character can be determined the rest ought to be easy. But when the task is to discover the\nmeaning of a derivative, especially a derivative of a root weak of the second or third radical or both, the student and even the experienced reader may have to turn from root to root, and in the end only find what he wants by accident. Who that has ever used Delitzsch's Handw\u00f6rterbuch has escaped this exasperation? Why should not the common-sense plan be adopted for the Assyrian which everybody employs in English, French, German, and other dictionaries, of placing the word in its alphabetical position, with the root in brackets in explanation of it?\n\nFor Mr. King's book we wish a wide circulation, and a speedy demand for a new and improved edition.\n\nJ. T.\n\nHandbooks to the History of Religions. The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria. By Morris Jastrow, Jun., Ph.D. (Boston, U.S.A.: Ginn & Company, 1898.)\n\nIn this volume of over 700 pages, the author gives a very complete account of the religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians, as far as it is now known to us. In reviewing such a theme as this, it is necessary to state, at the outset, that it is an exceedingly complicated subject, requiring a good knowledge of the inscriptions, much critical acumen, and likewise plenty of courage to attack.\n\nAfter a chapter treating of \"the land and the people,\" in which he leaves the Akkadian question entirely open, he treats of the Babylonian gods prior to the days of Hammurabi (2300 B.C.), during which period numerous divine names are found, of which he gives the list. At the head of these he places the god B\u0113l, or En-lil. Professor Jastrow is of opinion that En-lil or B\u0113l was originally a different deity from Marduk or Merodach, but was eventually identified with him on account of the ever-increasing influence of the city of Babylon, the centre of Merodach's worship. The author is no doubt right in\n\n1 The readings, he points out, are to be taken with reserve.\n2 Better Enlilla, and also pronounced Ellilla.\nattributing his deification to the fact that he was originally a \"powerful chieftain, armed with mighty weapons, but engaged in conflicts for the ultimate benefit of mankind.\"\n\nWhen treating of the Babylonian pantheon of the days of Hammurabi, the author gives a longish account of the goddess whose name is generally read by the German Assyriologists as Sarpanitum, which reading he also adopts, notwithstanding that the only authorized one is Zirpanitum or Zerpanitum. He points out the process of her identification with the goddess Er\u00fba, and her assimilization with B\u00ealtu or Beltis (why use the construct form Belit rather than the nominative B\u00ealtu?) is referred to incidentally on pp. 224 and 684. Of course, every goddess could be designated b\u00ealtu, 'lady,' just as all the gods could bear the title of b\u00ealu, 'lord,' but there was one B\u00eal and one B\u00ealtu, par excellence, the consort of B\u00eal, identified with Sarpanitum (Zerpanitum) probably at the time that En-lil (Ellill\u00e2 or B\u00eal) was identified with Marduk.\n\nIt is to be noted in connection with the name of Merodach, that Josef Grivel's attempt to identify him with the Biblical Nimrod (which has been accepted by Sayce) is not by any means so unsuccessful as it was, to all appearance, formerly thought to be. There is no proof that Gilgame\u0161 (with whom Nimrod was formerly identified) was a great hunter, but of all the hunters of the universe, Marduk must assuredly be held to be the greatest, for it was he who, when all the other gods turned back in fear, chased and entrapped with his net the mighty dragon of Chaos, Tiamtum, and put an end to her existence. Moreover, just as Nisroch is none other than a changed form of A\u0161\u0161ur (compare the Greek forms \u1f18\u03c3\u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c7 and \u1f18\u03c3\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03c7, which omit the initial n, and \u039d\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c7, which restores the original a in the first syllable), so, by the same process of adding \u05d9, has the original Amarudu (for an earlier Amarudug!) become in Hebrew Nimrod. Nisroch, or, as once given in Greek, Esorach, is\n\n1 Semiticized Amaruduk, then Maruduk, and ultimately (seemingly) Marduk, unless this last form be a man's name, abbreviated from Marduka, 'he of Merodach.'\na disfigured form of the name of A\u0161\u0161ur with the ending -ak, which appears as -uk in the full form of the name of Marduk, namely, Amuruduk.\\(^1\\)\n\nNot only does the author treat at length of the various gods, but he also describes fully the religious literature, including the incantations and charms. Besides this, the various legends are treated in full, as well as the cosmology, \"the Zodiacial System,\" the Babylonian view of life after death, and the temples and worship. Of these, it is probably the chapter treating of the various legends of the Babylonians and Assyrians that will be read with the greatest interest. In his concluding chapter, the author gives some remarks upon the religion of the Babylonians in general, and its influence on the beliefs of the world. After referring to the shortcomings of such a religious system as the Babylonians and Assyrians had\u2014how, in later times, \"the priests of Marduk set the fashion in theological thought\"\u2014he points out that the ancient traditions and myths were reshaped so as to contribute to the glory of that deity. It was the antiquity of Babylonian literature that prevented the cult from becoming uniform in all parts of the empire, and as each district, led by the priests, its natural theological leaders, held to the teaching, such as it was, of the tablets which they reverenced so much, everything tended to preserve religious opinions and teaching in the various provinces unchanged, so that uniformity could never be attained. The religion remained, therefore, the worship of various deities, differing (as to the chief deities) in each district, and a certain number of good and evil spirits and demons, and the demonology, as is well known, influenced greatly not only the beliefs of the Jews in that direction, but also, as the author points out, Christian beliefs as well, the most notable instance being the Book of Revelation,\n\n\\(^1\\) It is noteworthy that both Nimrod and Nisroch have, in Hebrew, the same vowel-points, showing that the forms have been, so to say, 'doctored.' Apparently some of the Hebrew scribes had a disinclination to record unchanged the names of heathen gods, and the form Abed-Nego for Abed-Nebo has been attributed, probably rightly, to this.\nchapter 12, and to this might be added also the description of the locusts with human heads and wings and tails of scorpions (which remind one of the 'scorpion-men' of the legends and the cylinder and other seals) referred to in chapter 9 of the same book.\n\nOn page 684 the author refers to a 'pilgrimage' that A\u0161\u0161ur-bani-apli made to \u0160agila to restore a statue that a former king of Assyria had taken from its place, and this reminds one that there are certain fragments of tablets of the nature of omens which refer to pilgrimages of a more real nature, and the benefits that might be expected to result from making them. On these fragments we find such entries as \"If one go to the Temple of the Hero, he will escape evil\"; \"If one go to the Temple of the Seven Gods, he will have peace\"; \"If one go to Niffer, trouble of a day, peace of a year.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the rather voluminous work of Professor Jastrow, there is still much to be learned and much to record about the religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians. Nevertheless, it is a most valuable and useful work, and may be regarded as giving a fair estimate of the subject, treated from a rather different standpoint than that of the well-known and still most suggestive and valuable Hibbert Lectures of Professor Sayce, to whom the author from time to time refers. On reading the book through, one feels that there is a certain loss of continuity in the method employed by the author of splitting up his description into periods, and that to deal with the history of the worship of each god separately, in a continuous manner, whilst still carefully indicating the periods into which he has divided the work, would have been better, because it would not have separated and placed in widely sundered parts of the book subjects that ought to form one continuous whole. This, however, will probably be found by others to be no disadvantage at all, and is, in any case, a mere matter of arrangement.\n\nT. G. Pinches.\nDe W\u0101qidii libro qui Kit\u0101b al Mag\u0101zi inscribitur\nCommentatio critica quam scripsit Josef Horovitz,\nDr. Phil. 8vo; pp. 48. (Berlin: Mayer & M\u00fcller,\n1898.)\n\nThe problem the author has endeavoured to solve is\nthe assignment of Al W\u0101qidi's Kit\u0101b al Magh\u0101zi to its\nproper place among the older works of Muhammedan\ntradition. He also investigates the sources used by him\nas well as his method of sifting the material collected.\nWhoever has had to deal with questions connected with\nthe Hadith, knows only too well what slippery ground this\nis, and how few and uncertain are the means of criticism.\nAl W\u0101qidi having written at the time when Ibn Hish\u0101m\nwas busy editing Ibn Ishaq's biography of Muhammed, it\nis of special interest to find out the relation which existed\nbetween these two oldest authors of the early history of\nIslam. As Ibn Hish\u0101m's work must be studied by com-\nparing it with Al Tabari's great \"History,\" so also much\nlight is thrown on Al W\u0101qidi by the same author.\nAlthough Sprenger regards Al W\u0101qidi's Kit\u0101b al Tarikh\nas an independent work, it was considered identical with\nthe Kit\u0101b al Magh\u0101zi, and it is probable that Dr. Horovitz\nis right in the inferences he draws from the statement\nof the Kit\u0101b al Fihrist, that Al Tabari's quotations were\noriginally taken from the Kit\u0101b al Magh\u0101zi. The incon-\ngruousness of these quotations with Al W\u0101qidi's text, as\nhanded down to us, is another difficulty which Dr. Horovitz\ntries to overcome by suggesting that Al W\u0101qidi himself\npublished a second and rectified recension of his work,\nand it was this which Al Tabari made use of.\n\nAs to the critical method applied by Al W\u0101qidi, it\ncompares rather unfavourably with Ibn Ishaq's manner of\nreproducing traditions. The latter does not lay so much\nstress on other versions of the same tradition as the former,\nand it is altogether interesting to observe how cautiously\nIbn Ishaq often narrates traditions of miraculous character,\nor which were not supported by good evidence. Apart\nfrom the instances mentioned by Dr. Horovitz, it is especially Ibn Ish\u0101q\u2019s reproduction of the Bah\u012bra legend for which he, by frequently interspersing the words \u0646\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0639\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0632\u0639\u0645\u0648\u0627 (I. Hish., pp. 115-17), evidently declines every responsibility. It is well known that Al W\u0101qid\u012b is not free from a certain bias. He shows several of the characteristics which distinguish the later and less reliable traditionists from the earlier ones, notably broader style, and an increased display of Muhammed\u2019s prophetic and military achievements. This is forcibly illustrated by the lists of the expeditions handed down by Ibn Ish\u0101q as well as Al W\u0101qid\u012b, and which Dr. Horovitz has done well to place side by side. Needless to say that Al W\u0101qid\u012b\u2019s is by far the larger.\n\nDr. Horovitz has managed to steer clear of the many difficulties of his extremely abstruse subject, and has embodied in his little book a surprising amount of reading and sound criticism. There is no doubt that he has furthered the general knowledge of the matter, and the essay will be useful to students of Muhammedan tradition. As a trifling correction, I should point out that the beginning of Sura ix is not albarr\u0101a, but bard\u2019a.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\n\nNotes on the Languages of the South Andaman Group of Tribes. By M. V. Portman. (Calcutta: Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, India, 1898.)\n\nThis is a heavy quarto, 390 + 191 pica pages, printed in a type easy to read, but in a confused manner for a work of this kind, which requires the judicious use of varied founts to bring out the points clearly for the reader. The blame for this fault no doubt does not lie with the author, from what one knows of the vagaries of a Government Press.\n\nIt is a work of exceeding interest to myself for many reasons, and perhaps I ought not to have undertaken to\nnotice it for this Society, as it frequently alludes to my own work on the subject, and is based on my own suggestions as to the form it has taken. But the thought that the Andamanese languages are of necessity known to a few only, has overruled personal considerations and induced me to agree to do so. The labour involved in the production of this elaborate work, spread over nearly twenty years, must have been very great, and every page shows the minute knowledge and painstaking accuracy of the author. In addition, the information given is mostly original, and all of it is at first hand. The whole, therefore, forms a volume of great intrinsic merit and value to philologists. Its pages contain, perhaps, the most thorough examination to which any 'savage' language has yet been subjected. Mr. Portman has, in truth, by this book added considerably to the debt of gratitude that science already owes him for his long-continued, patient, and intelligent studies of the Andamanese.\n\nHis peculiarities are, of course, now well known, including his defiant adherence to expressed views, and accordingly we have again his old trick of assuming that the public understands, without assistance, references to obscure and scarce books. Indeed, in one place he refers to \"My History of our relations with the Andamanese,\" which is not yet out, so far as I know; at any rate, I have never been favoured officially or otherwise with a printed copy thereof. And then he enters into a long criticism of details of Mr. Man's invaluable monograph on the Andamanese by means of references merely to the pages of the Journal of the Anthropological Institute. This will certainly serve only to puzzle the reader, as, unfortunately, subscribers to the Institute are not very numerous, as possibly they might be with advantage to themselves. We also find trotted out repeatedly Mr. Portman's favourite theory, as an established fact, of the probable disappearance in the early future of the Andamanese as a people, a theory which naturally may or may not be true. Let us all hope it is not, as I most certainly do.\nWith this notice of blemishes, which are after all not of much importance, let me turn to a very brief examination of the contents of this most laborious and valuable publication.\n\nLike all true teachers, Mr. Portman begins with an admirable map, taken from the Marine Survey of the Andamans. The only fault that could be found with this is that it does not embody the latest fruits of that Department's splendid work. But for this Mr. Portman is not to blame, as it was not possible for him to have included them. For the purposes of his book the map is complete, clear, and quite trustworthy.\n\nWe are also favoured with a short chapter on the five tribes of the Southern Andamanese, with their septs and divisions, replete with new and minute knowledge of the subject. These tribes are the Aka-Beads, Akar-Bale, Puchikwar, Aukau-Juwoi, and Kol. Aka-Beads is a more 'correct' form of the Bojig-ngijida of former works. In addition, all Andamanese are divided into long-shore men and forest men\u2014Aryauto and Eremtaga in the Aka-Beads language, which is that spoken about the great Penal Settlement at Port Blair. Each tribe speaks its own language, or rather variety, not dialect, of the general South Andaman language, of which Mr. Portman thinks the Puchikwar to be probably nearest the parent tongue, whatever that was. He notices, too, both generally and specifically, that the Andamanese freely use gestures to eke out the sense of their speech, and remarks on the richness of the languages in concrete terms and their poverty in abstract expressions. All this is natural in a group of savage tongues.\n\nThe bulk of Mr. Portman's book is taken up with well-chosen and well-presented specimens of the languages as actually used, and most careful analyses of typical sentences and words, a full explanation of the manner in which, and the plan on which, the words are built up, an attempt to translate a portion of the Bible into one of them, a comparative vocabulary, and an excellent analysis of the words\ntherein. The book has, however, no vernacular index, a want that every student thereof will at once feel.\n\nThe object of the work is \"to give a general idea of the languages and mental attitude of the people,\" and with the help of \"a comparative vocabulary and its analysis to show how the words are constructed and how the different languages compare with each other.\" To assist him in achieving this, Mr. Portman has utilized a small privately printed pamphlet of my own, which was \"A Brief Exposition of a Theory of Universal Grammar,\" specially designed, some sixteen years ago, to meet the very difficulties with which he had found himself face to face, when he commenced the work under review. That pamphlet arose out of the practical impossibility of using the usual inflexional system of grammar taught in Europe for the accurate description of a group of languages constructed after the fashion of the Andamanese. The book under notice is consequently of exceptional interest to myself, as a means of watching how my theory has stood the first practical test which has been applied to it. Mr. Portman has hardly used the Theory as I should myself have used it, still his use of it is such as to give an idea of its working in a stranger's hands.\n\nThe Theory I propounded had its immediate origin in the criticisms of the late Mr. A. J. Ellis, public and private, on my former work on the Andamanese speech, in which he pointed out that, in order to adequately represent, for scientific readers, such a form of speech, \"we require new terms and an entirely new set of grammatical conceptions, which shall not bend an agglutinative language to our inflexional translation,\" and he asked me accordingly if it were not possible \"to throw over the inflexional treatment of an uninflected language.\" This and the further consideration that, since every human being speaks with but the object of communicating his own intelligence to other human beings, the several possible ways of doing this must be based on some general laws applicable to them all, if one could only find them out, led me to make the attempt to\nconstruct a general theory on logical principles, which should abandon the inflexional treatment, its conceptions, and its terms. Now, my efforts led me not only to abandon the accepted grammatical terms, but also to reverse the accepted order of teaching them, to alter many accepted definitions, and while admitting much that is usually taught, both to add and omit many details. Taken all round, the Theory was a wide departure from orthodox teaching. But it is always difficult for human beings to take quite a new departure. The instinct of continuity\u2014of evolution\u2014is generally too strong in them to admit of a complete break with the past, and so Mr. Portman, while accepting my theory and using my terms in his laborious and remarkable pages, really does violence to both by adhering to the time-honoured plan of putting accident before syntax, in addition to the indiscriminate employment of the old terms side by side of my novel ones, in a confused and puzzling, but from the point of view of the evolutionist, a most interestingly na\u00efve style. I am also, I regret to say, otherwise far from feeling assured that he has understood aright either the theory or the terms, which by the way does not look well for my exposition! E.g., he says that one of the functions of the prefixes in Andamanese is to indicate the genders of the roots. But I purposely and expressly left \u2018gender\u2019 out of the Theory, because it is merely a clumsy mode of explaining a certain kind of inflexion. Again, while informing us that the prefixes are used to modify the meanings of the roots, he says, \u201cin short the prefixes are qualitative affixes,\u201d a term I employed to signify that class of affix which is used to denote the inherent qualities of a word. E.g., to use the familiar terminology, audi-re, verb; audi-en*, part.; audi-tor, noun:\u2014laugh-ter, noun; laugh-ing, part.; laughing-ly, adv. This sort of affix is quite a different thing from what I called a radical affix, used for modifying the meaning of the root into that of the stem deriving from the root, defining a stem to be root plus a modifying affix. This can be seen from the last word analyzed, \u2018laughingly,\u2019 where ly classifies the word, laugh is the root (in pedantic\nstrictness a stem, because it is an amplification of a simpler root), and laugh-ing the stem, i.e., the root modified by the affix ing. So in willingness and willingly, ness and ly would be qualitative affixes and ing a radical affix, as defined in the Theory.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Portman's treatment of the Theory is throughout such a compromise between the system under which he was brought up and that I proposed\u2014is such \"fine confused feeding\" in fact\u2014that I cannot attempt to follow it further in a brief notice of his book, and in order to see how far the Theory is applicable to its purpose, viz., the adequate explanation of a novel savage tongue, I will, with the permission of the Society, in a future issue of the Journal, put it to the test in my own way, using for the purpose Mr. Portman's sixth chapter on the Andaman Fire Legend, which he gives in all the five languages of the South Andamanese.\n\nWith these remarks, I will take leave for the present of Mr. Portman's last book, congratulating him on producing for scholars on the whole so fine an example of patient and intelligent study, combined with straightforward honest presentation.\n\nR. C. Temple.\n\nThe Gandh\u0101ra Sculptures. A selection of illustrations in twenty-five plates from the British and Lahor Museums, with notes on the age of the sculptures and descriptive remarks by J. Burgess, C.I.E., LL.D., F.R.S.E.\n\nUnder this title are included two numbers of the Journal of Indian Art (April and July, 1898) written by Dr. Burgess and furnished with excellent collotype illustrations by Mr. W. Griggs. These twenty-five plates of ancient Buddhist sculptures from various districts on the north-west frontier of India are intended to supplement the eighty-three already published, by the same author, in Part i of the Illustrations of the Ancient Monuments, Temples, and Sculptures of India. There is no need to dilate\nhere on the great importance, both for the history of art and the history of religion, of the study of these interesting sculptures; but the regret may be expressed that steps are not taken to collect them systematically and place them in some centre where they would be accessible to students. Of late years, and particularly since the recent military operations on the north-west frontier, they have been brought in large numbers to this country, only, in too many instances, to be lost in private houses. It ought not to be too much to expect that Government will, before it is too late, take some steps both to check the vandalism which is at present thoughtlessly destroying the traces of an ancient civilization, and to provide for the safe custody and the intelligent study of the monuments still existing.\n\nDr. Burgess gives a useful summary of the views which different scholars, notably M. Senart and Mr. Vincent Smith, have held as to the date of these sculptures, and the sources from which their art was derived. That the predominating influence was Roman can scarcely be questioned, and it seems possible, in many instances, to trace also the attitude and grouping of the figures and the details of ornamentation to Roman models. It is much to be desired that we may some day have a full treatment of this question of derivation; and such a work would manifestly be most perfect if undertaken in collaboration by two scholars representing the Roman and the Buddhist sides respectively.\n\nIt should be noted that the description at the foot of plate 2, \"Sculpture in Lahor Museum,\" does not refer, as might be imagined, to the whole plate, but only to figure 4. The three other figures are of objects in the British Museum, as correctly stated in the letterpress.\n\nIn thanking Dr. Burgess, who has done so much for the history of Indian art, for this important contribution, we may express the hope that he will still further increase our debt of gratitude to him by other publications of a similar character.\n\nE.

He found that the authority of the B\u0101b\u2019s direct\nsuccessor had by this time been almost entirely superseded by Beha-u-Uah and his son Abbas; and, in fact, that the character of the religion had been very largely altered. An aggressive spirit of reform had yielded to the cardinal doctrine of a universal tolerance, which, while more amiable, was less calculated to create enthusiasm, and the quietism which had become a feature of the religion had probably rendered it less active for good as well as for violence. However, there was every indication that the religion was increasing in the number of its adherents, though it was very difficult to form any conjecture as to their real numbers, owing to the secrecy still observed among its devotees. This secrecy was to some extent justified by occasional persecutions; but these were not very frequent, and would probably become still less so as the harmless character of the religion became appreciated.\n\nA discussion followed, in which Mr. E.

Obituary Notices.\n\nHofrath Friedrich M\u00fcller.\n\nHofrath Friedrich M\u00fcller, Professor of Comparative Philology, and Sanskrit, in the University of Vienna, was born on the 3rd of March, 1834, at Jemnik, in Bohemia; from 1853 to 1857 he was a student in the\nNotes of the Quarter.\n\nHe studied Philosophy at Vienna, and in 1859 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at T\u00fcbingen. He utilized his residence at G\u00f6ttingen to make considerable advances in the field of Philology. In 1858 he entered the service of the University Library of Vienna, and in 1861 obtained a position in the Imperial Library at the same place. In addition he had employed himself as a 'Privatdozent' in Linguistic study; in 1866 he became a Professor of Oriental Languages in the Vienna University.\n\nHe was recognized as the leading authority of Comparative Philology of his time. His studies had extended over every branch of Linguistic Knowledge, and there existed no language in the world, of which he could not indicate the characteristics, and the family to which it belonged. The greatest service, however, which he rendered was that he was the first scholar who brought Ethnology into close connection and touch with Comparative Philology, and recognized it as an aid to the study of Language. He published in 1867 and 1868 \"The Voyage of the Austrian Navigator N. . . .\"\n\nIn the year 1873 he published his magnificent work \"Allgemeine Ethnographie\" in three volumes, and an appendix, and between the years 1876 and 1888 his \"Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft.\" To this book I am deeply indebted, as it helped me in my own Linguistic studies, and the author paid me the great compliment of dedicating one volume to me. In my book on the Languages of Africa, published 1883, I adopted his classification of African Languages, and never regretted having done so. From p. 453 of that book I quote the following passage:\n\n\"Friedrich Muller I have never seen in the flesh: when I called upon him in the Hof-Bibliotek of Vienna, he was absent at the Baths. But I seemed to know him. In one of the books, which I ventured to send to his African Collection, I wrote:\n\n'Ich habe Dich mit den Augen nicht gesehen, aber mit der Seele habe ich Deine Freundlichkeit erkannt.'\n\"I shall ever feel grateful for his help and advice.\"\n\nSince 1883 I met him several times, notably at the Vienna Congress of 1886. He died on May 25, 1898. I was always getting postcards from him, and one reached me only a few weeks before his death, asking for a copy of a Grammar of a South American Language, which I was lucky enough to be able to send to him.\n\nR. N. C.\n\nHenry Clarke Warren, Esq., of Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1854\u20131899.\n\nBene qui latuit, bene rixit. The \"rage for fame\" never possessed this patient, quiet man; but his learning and achievement assure him an honourable place in the annals of American scholarship. His death is a grievous loss to Oriental studies in America. For he was, first of all, a true scholar; his work, in part still unpublished, is of intrinsic and abiding value; and his life and the spirit which informed it were an example and a blessing to those who came within its influence. He was, moreover, born to ample wealth, and of this he was ready to give gladly to causes that proved themselves worthy of a beneficence which was both sober-minded and unostentatious. His life\u2014cut off, like that of James Darmesteter, in the midst of the \"glorious forties\"\u2014was, also like that of the French Orientalist,\u00b9 a constant struggle against the awful odds of physical infirmity. In Warren's infancy, a fall from a chaise produced an injury of utmost gravity. It resulted in a spinal lesion, apparently like that from which Darmesteter suffered. And so Warren's accomplishments are, as it were, a victory wrested from adverse fate.\n\nMr. Warren was born in Boston, November 18th, 1854. As partial countervail for his exclusion from the ordinary pleasures and privileges of childhood and youth, he received careful private instruction and the advantages of travel\u2014journeys to Egypt and to Southern California may be\n\n\u00b9 See his obituary in this Journal, 1895, p. 217.\nmentioned. He took the bachelor's degree at Harvard College in 1879, and went, at the beginning of the next term, to Baltimore, to continue, at the Johns Hopkins University, under Professor Lanman, the study of Sanskrit, which he had already begun as a college student. And here he remained for several years after Professor Lanman's removal to Harvard, working under the guidance of his successor, Professor Bloomfield. In 1884 Warren returned to the home of his father, in Boston. The latter died in 1888, and not long after the latter established himself at Cambridge, in a beautiful place near the Harvard Library, the residence of a Harvard professor of fifty years ago; and there he abode for the rest of his days.\n\nA visit to London in 1884, and especially the contagious enthusiasm of Professor Rhys Davids, seem to have been potent factors in Mr. Warren's decision to devote himself to P\u0101li literature of Southern Buddhism. The J\u0101taka, as edited by our honoured veteran colleague, Professor Faustboll, of Copenhagen, had failed not of its charm for Mr. Warren. The edition had then progressed as far as the third volume; and with a version of the first story thereof, the \"Little K\u0101li\u1e45ga,\" Mr. Warren made his d\u00e9but in print. This translation, presumably the first ever made in America from the P\u0101li, appeared October 27, 1884, and, for a reason that will interest some of the members of this Society, in the Providence Journal. Providence is the seat of Brown University; and to its Library the Rev. Dr. J. N. Cushing, long a Baptist missionary in Rangoon, had given some twenty palm-leaf manuscripts, mostly parts of the Tipi\u1e6daka, and in Burmese writing, at that time perhaps the only considerable portion of the Buddhist scriptures in the United States. An English specimen of the literature to which these strange books belong might therefore be presumed to interest the people of the University town.\n\nWarren's study of the P\u0101li literature was now prosecuted with zeal and persistency, and his knowledge of the edited texts, as well as of many important inedita, grew constantly wider and deeper. Aside from a few incidental papers,\nmentioned below, the first-fruit of these studies was his \"Buddhism in Translations,\" which was published by Harvard University in 1896 as volume iii of the \"Harvard Oriental Series.\" Of this it is needless here to speak in detail, for the work has already been noticed at length in these columns (1897, pages 145\u2013149). Mr. Warren's purpose was to make the great authorities on Buddhism speak for themselves, directly and in English uncoloured by any translator's prejudice. The value of his work lies largely in the selection of the passages; partly in the order and partly in the form of their presentation; and partly also in the inclusion of a considerable amount of material previously inaccessible.\n\nThis material is from Buddhaghosa's \"Way of Purity\" or \"Path of Holiness,\" the \"Visuddhi-magga.\" Its famous author flourished about 400 A.D. His book is a systematic exposition of Buddhist doctrine, and may be justly adjudged to be the most important treatise of its kind and scope now extant. Mr. Warren presented to the Oriental Congress at London in 1892 an elaborate analysis of the entire work. The text has already been printed in Ceylon in Sinhalese letters; but that fact, as P\u0101li scholars know to their cost, is far from making it accessible to Occidental students. To publish a scholarly edition of this text, printed in English letters, and with all the facilities for ready comprehension which Occidental typography makes possible, to provide suitable indexes, and to give a complete English translation\u2014such had become the ambition of Warren's scholarly life. And a most noble ambition it was, as all who know aught of the illustrious monk, Buddhaghosa, and of this, the masterpiece among his voluminous writings, will readily admit.\n\nThe consummation of Mr. Warren's plan in all its essential features is most devoutly to be wished. A brief account of the state of the work at the editor's demise is pertinent. His main reliance was the Burmese manuscript belonging to the India Office Library. Besides this, he had a Sinhalese manuscript from Professor Rhys Davids, and\nanother from the late Dr. Richard Morris. And a fourth manuscript he had obtained from Henry Rigg, Esq., consulting engineer to the Government of India, for railways. With the help of accurate transcripts of these four (which he owed to the efficient assistance of Miss Louise Brooks), he had made his collations, and had established his text from beginning to end, aside from the final adjustment of many orthographic details in which the Burmese and the Insular copies are wont to differ. An important task to which Mr. Warren had addressed himself was the tracing of Buddhaghosa's citations from the canonical and other antecedent writings back to their sources\u2014scattered as they are throughout a large literature. About half of the quotations had thus been identified. The English version covers nearly one-half of the text, albeit parts are still in unfinished form. It ought therefore to be possible to do the other half upon the same general principles and in the same general style, so that the work can truly be issued as Mr. Warren's.\n\nMr. Warren maintained a lively and intelligent interest in many things that lay without his own field, so in natural science, especially chemistry and physiology, and in the history of speculation. It was, accordingly, the philosophical side of Buddhism which was to him its most attractive aspect. For this reason, too, no doubt, the keen dialectic of Buddhaghosa made special appeal to him. And hence it is doubly to be regretted that there is no one in America so well qualified as he was, by knowledge of the literature and by philosophical study, to finish his work.\n\nMr. Warren had long been a member of the American Oriental Society, serving it for years with zeal as its Treasurer and as one of its Board of Directors. He was a devoted son of Harvard, generous and loyal. And as a citizen, whether of the municipality or of the Commonwealth, he was no less public-spirited than modest, ever ready to do his full share in works of enlightened organized charity, or to help, for example, in the preservation of our forests or in the reform of the civil service. Thus in many\nways and for divers reasons he will be sorely missed among his colleagues, his neighbours, and friends, and not the least for the example which he set for us as scholars. His was the 'friendliness' or 'good-will' (metta) which played such a role among the p\u0101ram\u012bs of the gentle Gotama; his was patient and cheerful courage in adversity; his were high intellectual endowments, directed by a character unselfish and lofty, and pure; and his was a profoundly religious nature: for these things, while we mourn, let us remember him and be glad.\n\nC.

J. Rodgers.\n\nCharles James Rodgers was born in 1838 in the small hamlet Wilne Mills, Derbyshire, where his father was manager of a cotton-spinning factory. He was educated at schools at Shardlow and Milford, both in Derbyshire, being a pupil teacher at the latter, and from it obtained by competition a Queen's Scholarship at the Borough Road College, London.\nAfter two years' training at the College he was appointed master of the National School at Fenstanton, Cambs, and whilst there, feeling attracted to work in India, prepared himself by studying Oriental languages, going into Cambridge to attend lectures at the University on those subjects. In 1863 he was sent out to India by the Christian Vernacular Education Society, the work given him being to establish and conduct a Training College for Native Teachers on the same line as the British and Foreign Training Colleges in England. This he did at Amritsar. Very much through his efforts the handsome College, of which he was for twenty-two years Principal, was built and maintained in efficiency, many trained teachers from it being sent out to all parts of India. He soon began to study Persian and the vernaculars of the region in which he was working, as well as to interest himself in the history and archaeology of India, taking up Indian Numismatics as a specialty. His ability and knowledge were recognized by his being appointed in 1896 Archaeological Surveyor of the Panjab. Mr. Rodgers worked zealously in his new position, collecting a very large amount of information and material for study during the five years he held it; but then, unfortunately, the Government in a time of retrenchments abolished the appointment, and he, having of course given up his college on getting work under Government, was cast adrift. In his capacity as Honorary Numismatist to the Government of India he got some occasional work in arranging and cataloguing collections in the Panjab and Calcutta, but being unable to find regular employment, came home to England in poor health and much dispirited. Early in last year he got the small post of Secretary to the Religious Book Society at Lahore, and went out again, but not for long, as he died there in November. Mr. Rodgers married in 1866 one who was in every way a help to him in his work, being a gifted linguist and able teacher. She has been for many years Superintendent of Schools for Girls at Amritsar, and is now left with a large family, several of whom are still dependent on her.\nMr. Rodgers' work in Oriental Numismatics was wide, and extended over a long course of years. His writings were chiefly published in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society, to which he contributed some thirty papers between the years 1871 and 1897, on Sikh, Durrani, Kashmir, Kangra, Dehli Kings, Dehli Moghul, and Muhammadan Native States Coinages, some of which opened out new fields of study. During the years 1894-95 he was engaged in cataloguing the Coin Collections of the Government Museums at Lahore and Calcutta and the publication of the two large volumes of the catalogues, which unfortunately, through no fault of the author, as was pointed out in the notices of them in our Journal of 1894 and 1897, are not so useful as they might have been, yet well show his knowledge and industry. His diligence in hunting out coins and reading them was as remarkable as the extent and unselfishness of his knowledge about them, and probably all who have been engaged in like studies of late years were indebted to him for some help given, if not directly, at any rate by his writings. And although one could not always agree with his readings, or see so much as he thought he did, there was always reason in them, and he was properly tolerant of criticism rightly made. Probably arising from his study of the baits or couplets on Moghul coins, Mr. Rodgers paid a good deal of attention to Persian acrostic, cryptogram, and chronogram modes of writing. His paper in the October, 1898, number of our Journal, on \"Tarikhs\" shows his proficiency in that mode, and the following, composed on the occasion of the Queen's Jubilee, is an example of his style in the acrostic:\n\nA Sonnet.\n\nZeal for the faith has not been always shown\nAt least by those who were 'Defensor' called.\nIn every age, men, more or less enthralled,\nNe'er rose to heights when seated on a throne,\nAnd, though the cross was ever on the crown,\n\nJ.B.A.S. 1899.\nThe wearer's heart ne'er seemed the sign to bear.\nUseless that sign if unallied with care;\nLife, 'neath the Cross, all selfish ends must drown.\nAh! how blest we to see a Lady lone\nBegirt with sorrows rise above them all,\nIntent on doing good whate'er befall,\nDeeming that duty ornaments the throne.\nIn her we see the glory of all time\nNot dimmed by years, but yearly more sublime.\n\nZainat ul abidin.\n\nO.

XIV.\u2014Two Lists of Words from B\u0101\u1e47a's 'Har\u1e63a-Carita.'\nBy F. W. Thomas, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe following lists are composed of words and meanings which, occurring in the Har\u1e63a-Carita of B\u0101\u1e47a, are not quoted, or are instanced only from grammars, dictionaries, and commentaries, in the great St. Petersburg Lexicon and the smaller Lexicon of B\u00f6htlingk. Only a few words not coming under this definition have for special reasons been included; namely, where I was unable in the Kashmir text to verify B\u00f6htlingk's references to B\u0101\u1e47a's work, where only an inferior work is cited, and where I or the Sanskrit commentator, \u00c7ankara, did not adopt the exact rendering given in the two dictionaries. It did not appear on the whole worth while to quote words and meanings simply because their earliest occurrence was in the Har\u1e63a-Carita, or because they illustrated the well-known and extremely close lexical affinity of B\u0101\u1e47a's works with such books as the Br\u0101hma-Samhita, R\u0101ja-Tarangini, Kath\u0101-Sarit-Sagara, V\u0101savadatt\u0101, Da\u00e7akum\u0101ra-Carita, and also the K\u0101vy\u0101 literature in general.\n\nFor the sake of convenience I have made two lists, one of new words and the other of new meanings. In both lists italics indicate that the word (or meaning) is quoted by the St. Petersburg Lexicon only from Sanskrit grammars,\nI.\n\ni\n\n245. 7\n\n202. 13\n| Word                                      | Meaning                                                                 | Page |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| ak\u1e5btin 'ak\u1e5bt\u0101rtha\u1e25,' 'ineffectual'        |                                                                          | 239.13 |\n| ak\u1e5btrim\u0101l\u0101patva, 'the possession of (1) truthful, (2) superhuman utterance' |                                                                          | 109.20 |\n| ak\u1e63a\u1e47ika 'vyagra\u1e25,' 'intent'              |                                                                          | 163.14 |\n| ak\u1e63avalya, 'rosary'                       |                                                                          | 51.6 |\n| ak\u1e63avalyin, 'wearing a rosary'            |                                                                          | 43.21 |\n| akhala, 'not a ruffian'                   |                                                                          | 202.13 |\n| agr\u0101myat\u0101, 'urbanity'                     |                                                                          | 38.14 |\n| agr\u0101mi\u1e47a, 'urbane'                        |                                                                          | 277.20 |\n| agresar\u0101\u1e25, 'leader,' 'chief among' (B. from Kha\u1e47\u1e0dapra\u1e63asti) |                                                                          | 214.19 |\n| anik\u012bk\u1e5bta, 'embraced'                     |                                                                          | 182.6 |\n| a\u1e45gavalana, 'uneasy movements of limbs'   |                                                                          | 33.1, 74.9 |\n| a\u1e45g\u0101rakita, 'turned to charcoal'          |                                                                          | 66.15, 206.21 |\n| a\u1e45g\u0101rat\u0101, 'condition of charcoal'         |                                                                          | 167.17 |\n| acapala, 'without tricks'                 |                                                                          | 202.12 |\n| acchabhalla, 'bear' (B. quotes B\u0101lar. and Vikram\u0101\u1e45k.) |                                                                          | 260.10 |\n| a\u1e45jalik\u0101rik\u0101 'm\u1e5b\u1e47mayaprati\u1e41\u0101 \u00e7alabhanjik\u0101 v\u0101,' 'a kind of statue' |                                                                          | 163.12 |\n| atavipr\u0101yapr\u0101ntat\u0101, 'the having extremities consisting mainly of forest' |                                                                          | 255.8 |\n| atitik\u1e63nat\u0101, 'excessive sharpness'        |                                                                          | 118.15 |\n| atidh\u012brat\u0101, 'excessive gravity'           |                                                                          | 154.11 |\n| atinamrat\u0101, 'excessive flexibility'       |                                                                          | 117.2 |\n| atini\u1e25\u00e7abda, 'very silent'                |                                                                          | 171.17 |\n| atipatiy\u0101s, 'very keen'                   |                                                                          | 177.5 |\n| atibhadrat\u0101, 'excessive courtliness'      |                                                                          | 28.13 |\n| atibhirut\u0101, 'excessive timidity'          |                                                                          | 212.15 |\n| atim\u0101rga\u1e47a, 'very importunate,' with pun on m\u0101rga\u1e47a 'arrow' |                                                                          | 152.10 |\n| atimrduh\u1e5bdayat\u0101, 'excessive tenderness of heart' |                                                                          | 274.21 |\n| atiyantr\u0101\u1e47a, 'excessive restraint or formality' (cf.

The 'Solar' Race.\n\nThe whole of this subject is so difficult that I must submit the following remarks as purely tentative, and express a hope that others with more accurate knowledge will correct me. It will be well to begin with what appears to be at least tolerably certain facts. (1) The Rgveda shows nothing, directly, of any advance of Aryans to Ayodhya or the further kingdoms under the Naipal Himalaya, nor does the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. But both specify an Aikshw\u0101ka settlement on the Indus; and we shall see some early indications, from other sources, of 'Solar' tribes beyond Ayodhya, Mithil\u0101, and Vai\u015b\u0101li, their chief centres. Our evidence for the 'Solar' dynasty of Ayodhya is the R\u0101m\u0101yana, supplemented by the genealogies of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as. The Buddhist writings throw some light on the subject also. (2) The kingdom of Ayodhya very early passed away; the more historic kingdoms in that region are connected with Buddhist times and with \u015aravasti, Kapilavastu, etc. (3) It is certainly the case that there were early sun-worshipping tribes in India, and not only in the Oudh region. We know of sun-worship and serpent-worship in K\u0101\u015bmir; we hear of it among the ancient Saur\u0101 of Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and the B\u0101la (or originators of Valabhipura); the K\u0101thi (vassals of the B\u0101la) are still sun-worshippers.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Arch. Rep., ii, 34.\nMult\u0101n, connected with the Malloi of the Greeks (who are possibly the same as the B\u0101l\u0101), was a centre of sun-worship as late as the time of Aurangzeb. It is quite possible that there may have been 'Solar' tribes of Aryan connection, whose nature-worship took the form of a special devotion to the sun, and that a sharp line of distinction cannot be drawn between these, and the Turanian, and later 'Indo-Scythian,' tribes. But one particular tribe among the whole became regarded as the first in rank\u2014as the 'Solar' race per excellence; that was the tribe descended from Ikshw\u0101ku.\n\nWhen Hindu tradition had long associated a particular dignity and venerable antiquity with the Ayodhya kingdom and its hero R\u0101ma, all tribes of any earlier sun-worshipping connection would, on becoming orthodox Hindus, hasten to invent a connection of their chief clans or families with R\u0101ma and his sons, in particular.\n\nNext there appear to be certain matters which are highly probable. I think Ikshw\u0101ku was a real person. His line (unlike that of Puru), though a long one, is very slightly extended or developed (by the books) in collateral branches. Its locale is confined chiefly to Ayodhya and Vai\u015b\u0101li, and to Mithil\u0101 (or Videh\u0101) further east. Chiefly, but not entirely; for (as I have said) the Rgveda acknowledges Aikshw\u0101ka princes in the Indus Valley. A king there is described as 'revant' (rich); and in the M., Subala, of the Aikshw\u0101ka tribe, is a vassal of Jayadratha king of Sindhu-Sauv\u012bra.\u00b9 The Pur\u0101\u1e47as also speak in general terms of the distribution of Aikshw\u0101ka princes, and in one case, at least, give us a definite locale in Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. But let me here introduce a short genealogy (Table III), and make a few remarks as to where the Pur\u0101\u1e47as locate the descendants. The progenitor is, as usual, mythical. Aditi is the primeval mother of the Sun (whence the name \u0100ditya). The Sun's offspring is Manuvaivaswata.\u00b2 Most of Ikshw\u0101ku's eight or nine brothers are quite untraceable.

And, I may add, Ikshw\u0101ku is made about four generations earlier than Yay\u0101ti, the head in Tables I and II. The V.P. gives Ikshw\u0101ku the usual one hundred sons, placing fifty of them as potentates of 'the Northern' countries and forty-eight of 'the Southern.' The Bh\u0101gavata P. improves on this, and places some in the centre (presumably Oudh); some in the east (presumably Mithil\u0101, or possibly in Mah\u0101kosal\u0101); and some in the west (the Sindh and Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra group). There is no direct mention of Ikshw\u0101ku as king of Ayodhya in the V.P. But the V\u0101yu-P. places Ikshw\u0101ku's son as 'king of Ayodhya.' The table marks also the founders of '\u015aravasti' and Kapilavastu. Mithil\u0101 is founded by a grandson of Ikshw\u0101ku, thus placing Videh\u0101 early in the list of dominions. How far this agrees with the story of Mathava and the sacred fire in the \u015aatap. Br., I have not inquired. The whole list implies an antiquity of the Solar race greater than that of the Y\u0101dava or the Lunar.\u00b9 The Pauranic genealogy appears to have been subjected to some manipulation; it appears to be elaborated from the briefer but, in some respects, more probable list in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, which also does not go beyond R\u0101ma and his sons.

Probably the region so far north and east of the central region made somewhat outside the current of affairs. The aspect however, changed much with the rise of Buddhism among the Eastern tribes. The kingdom of Ayodhya, with Vai\u015b\u0101li and Mithil\u0101, must have been of very extent; and Ayodhya, as a Hindu centre, must have an end at a then relatively recent date\u2014perhaps some time after the great war. The real importance of the region, as known to us, is Buddhist, not Hindu. Avasti and Kapilavastu, not Ayodhya, are historical centres. It was not only that from this neighbourhood Buddhism arose, but the whole country, from its proximity to Magadha and the sacred associations of G\u0101y\u0101, gained political as well as religious importance. From this centre, the Mauryan emperor was able to send the Buddhist faith almost all over India.\n\nThe entire silence of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the Vishnu-Pur\u0101\u1e47a about Ayodhya is remarkable. In the case of the former we may suppose the great glory of Ayodhya and the R\u0101ma dynasty to have already passed away; for King Vrihadbala of Kosala is mentioned among the allies, but without any particular distinction. His place in the list of descent shows that the great war was understood to have happened more than thirty generations after R\u0101ma. The Vishnu-Pur\u0101\u1e47a deserves a little more notice. I cannot pretend to judge of its date from a literary or linguistic point of view, but from its contents it could not apparently have been written or compiled before the fifth or sixth century of our era\u2014at a date, I mean, when the M\u0101lava tribe had established themselves in the country which then acquired their name, and especially when all the invading Indo-Scythian, Gujar, and H\u016bna tribes were well known. The writer, at some orthodox Hindu capital, would know nothing about Oudh. Always girt with\n\n1 I take the list as in Lassen, I, App., pp. xiii, xiv.\n2 This is discussed further on. The tribe was certainly not an early one in the locality, but is placed there in the V.P.\nforest, the country by that time had been destroyed, and its palaces were buried in jungle; even the Buddhist centres had long been laid more or less in ruins, as we know from Fa-Hian and Hwen Thsang. The author would hesitate to commit himself to definite details about Ayodhya, and only vaguely alludes to better known places\u2014Sravasti, Kapilavastu, and Vaisali.\n\nThe whole history really centres round Rama; even his sons Lava and Ku\u015ba do not make any figure. The V.P. says nothing of Lava, but apparently means (with the Raghuvamsa) to continue Ku\u015ba at Ayodhya, where he is ultimately followed by Vrihadhala, who ends the line. The V.P. \u2018prophetically\u2019 continues the list of kings, and (though unwilling to say anything about the Buddhist kings) is obliged to allude to Suddhodhana and \u015a\u0101kya. These, however, were not kings of Ayodhya, but of the region east-north-east of Oudh. The V.P. has accounted for Buddha (in an earlier chapter) as an \u2018illusory being\u2019 created to beguile the \u2018Daityas,\u2019 who oppose the worship of the true gods. Early destruction overtook the whole country, as I have said; and the first information we have is from the European geographers. We find Ptolemy\u2019s map showing the Tanganoi (Ta\u1e45ga\u1e47a tribe of the M.) in the north, and the Maroundai (or Maraemda\u00ef) below them. Here, too, are the Amanichai, and the Sandrabatis (Chandrava\u1e47si?), possibly a real relic of the old Lunar race in Part\u0101bgarh. What the nationality of the tribes so named may be, has not, I believe, been ascertained.\n\nIn this connection it is natural to think of the Bharata. Whether or not the existing Bhar tribes, still numerous in Oudh and the further part of the N.W.P., are a surviving relic, it is quite certain that the \u2018very numerous\u2019 race of\n\n---\n\n1 This is well put in the Oudh Gazetteer, Introduction, xxxiii, xxxiv.\n2 The V\u0101yu-P. makes Lava reign at Sravasti. In the V.P. there is some apparent attempt to make Ku\u015ba in some way connected with the Kosala beyond the Vindhy\u0101n, and to make him found a city on the brow of the Vindhyan hills.\n3 It seems that these may either be subject tribes which regained independence by the destruction of Aryan overlords, or some new invasion of Indo-Scythians. There is a mention of a Marunda tribe in Samudragupta\u2019s inscription, but apparently it is on the North-West frontier.\nBharata are represented as settling within the same general limits as the Kuru-Pa\u00f1c\u0101la, etc., and in the very regions where Bhar clan still remain or were formerly dominant. On the usual plan in the Epics and Pur\u0101\u1e47as, Bharata becomes a king in the Doab; and though the matter is never clearly stated, it is implied that the Bharata people are absorbed into, and under, the Aryan race who dominated the country. And as it is curious that both the Lunar and Solar genealogies adopt Bharata, it is natural to suggest the reason of this, viz., that the tribe was taken into the pale of Aryan tribes, partly into the Solar and partly into the Lunar. In origin they may have been Dravidian, since they were builders, like so many Dravidian tribes. I do not know whether the peculiar (\u015b\u016brajbedi) position of their 'tanks' can be taken as an indication of Sun-worship, or whether anything can be inferred from the pointed heads of the kings in sculpture; but this is quite a subsidiary matter. Now, if the best houses and clans became 'Hindu,' there might well have been a lower stratum not so received, which fused with similar local clans of Kolarian race: and we know (in other parts) that Kolarians have so mixed with Dravidian and other races. In that case, the upper class of 'Bharata' would cease to be separately mentioned or enumerated, and would have shared the fortunes and the eclipse of the Brahmanic, military, and other, Hindus in the Central region, while the lower class, which now appears alone to survive, may be (in part) a remnant that never attained any social position, and (in part) include vestiges of some clans who have really fallen from a once superior rank. It is hardly possible to read the notices of the Bharata in literature, and their association with an evidently Brahmanic teacher like Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, without feeling that they must have been freely admitted among the Aryan tribes.\n\n1 As to the statement that the 'Bhar' (as a whole) are Kolarian, I cannot find that it is supported by any general evidence. It cannot be inferred from the connection of the (very uncertainly spelt) name of the Bhar people with 'Ber'\u2014the Indian fig-tree\u2014because that derivation is quite arbitrary; and it is very doubtful if, the tribal name being really Bharata or Bh\u0101rata, that name could be\nRegarding the 'Solar' territories beyond Oudh to the east and north-east, I have obtained very little information, but the Buddhist writings may give more. We find Suddhodhana, the father of 'Gautama' Buddha, reigning over a clan called \u015a\u0101kya; and whether that is connected with 'Gautama' (and implies a Brahman (?) descent), or with a 'R\u0101jput' clan which many centuries later bore the name of 'Gautam,' I am unable to say. A genuine \u015a\u0101kya inscription, though a short one, has recently been discovered. Whether this was really a Brahmanical kingdom, and in what stage of Hindu development, cannot be stated; but the Buddhist writings mention many Brahmans in the \u015a\u0101kya country. Next to the \u015a\u0101kya, and separated by the Koh\u0101na river, was the Koliyan tribe, to which Buddha's mother, and his early deserted wife, belonged. In the neighbourhood, too, and close to the northern hills, we hear of the Malla or Mallaki tribe of Kapilavastu, in nine divisions. Here, too, are the Li\u00e7chavi tribe of Vai\u015b\u0101li, also in nine divisions, and understood to be 'Suryava\u1e43si.' Such was their dignity that the Gupta emperors were afterwards proud to record on inscriptions and coins, their connection with the family: it seems probable that the Gupta era was really derived from the Li\u00e7chavi.\n\nII. The other possible centres of 'Solar' tribes are but vaguely indicated.\n\nI have mentioned already the Ikshw\u0101ku kings on the Indus as alluded to in the \u1e5agveda and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\n\nderived from Bar (Skt.

The existing Bhar are apparently a very mixed race, and have no distinct language; the presence of some Kolarian customs would not necessarily indicate that the whole race was Kolarian. On the contrary, if they are the remains of a larger race coming from the North-West and contemporary with the Aryans, their origin would more probably be Turanian.\n\n1 Beames' Elliot, Gloss., i, 115 ff. They do not appear in history before the Muhammadan conquest of Kanauj, and only near Fatehpur on the Ganges.\n\n2 Kalpasutra (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxiii, p. 266). Mr. Howitt also refers to the Sumangala Vil\u0101sana, in the Pali Text Society's edition, regarding the \u015a\u0101kya. This I have not seen.\n\n3 Like some other tribes of the period, the Li\u00e7chavi are said to have been at first non-monarchical; when they accepted kingly rule, Jayadeva I originated the Nep\u0101l era.\nThe genealogy of the Pur\u0101\u1e47a would suggest some connection with the sun-worshippers in Taxila and the N.W. Panj\u0101b hills. So, again, we have an ancient descendant of Ikshv\u0101ku\u2019s brother made to dominate a (not extensive) local kingdom in the Gujar\u0101t peninsula (Anarta). Still more vague is the suggestion that there must be some cause for the attachment of the name \u2018Kosala,\u2019 not only to \u2018Oudh\u2019 (distinguished as Uttara Kosala, i.e. Kosala in the north), but to \u2018Mah\u0101 Kosal\u0101,\u2019 a place south of the Vindhya line, including the Ch\u0101tt\u012bsgarh plain, and possibly including places nearer the Vindhyan hills at the western end.\u00b9 When the Solar prince B\u0101hu or Bahuk\u0101 is attacked by the T\u0101lajangha and Haihaya tribes, it is implied\u00b2 that he was driven out of his kingdom into the forest; and unless we suppose the Western T\u0101lajangha clansmen to have marched as far as the Oudh region (Northern Kosala), the more natural suggestion is that the Solar princes had, formerly, dominions somewhere in the Eastern (or even Western) Vindhyan region, near the old Haihaya and T\u0101lajangha. More I cannot say; but it is worth while noticing that a tribe of real antiquity, and still known in Oudh (Hardoi, etc.) and the eastern part of Upper India, as the \u2018Nikumbh,\u2019 seems to have some connection with such a Vindhyan locale. Mr. Crookes quotes Cunningham as accepting their descent from Nikumbh\u0101, who, though omitted in the short Solar genealogy of the R\u0101m\u0101yana, is nevertheless apparently fully entitled to a place. It is known on fairly good evidence\u00b3 that, being at some remote date driven from Oudh, this clan acquired possessions, not only in Alwar and that part of R\u0101jput\u0101na, but that they preceded the Sisodhya in Mew\u0101r (whence perhaps they expelled the Mers, who gave the name to the country?). Not only so, but Mr. Crookes refers to two twelfth and early thirteenth century inscriptions found in K\u0101nhde\u015b,\u2074 in which the reigning\n\n\u00b9 See Lassen, i, 688, and the references in the note.\n\u00b2 See Wilson, V.P., p. 373.\n\u00b3 The whole case is stated in Crookes (Tribes of the N.W.P.), vol. iv, 86 f.\n\u2074 Crookes, vol. ii.\nto have descended from King Nikumbh\u0101, in Mandh\u0101t\u0101 (Mandh\u0101tri of the lists) was famous, Tara and others. The Hardoi district and other in Oudh and those in Gorakhpur, are return (from Alwar) in the fifteenth century. Another connects them with the Ka\u00e7hw\u0101ha from Jaipur, service with the R\u0101thor of Kanauj and the Tu\u0101r. Both may be true. There is also a connected themselves merely 'Raghuvar\u1e47\u012b,' as belonging to a later descendant of Nikumbh\u0101, and near to who is often designated 'R\u0101ghava'). Some of the thus have wandered as far as the Panj\u0101b (Jammu where they are often included in the 'Manh\u0101s' clan. present instance the point is, that apparently there be a Solar locale as far west as K\u0101nhde\u015b below the re, and some way west of the usually allotted site nikosala.\n\nother respects it is always easy for any clan, especially that had worshipped the Sun, to invent a connection with Ah\u0101rya' and its kings. And as illustrating this side of question, I may call attention to the stages of the process pretty clearly shown by the 'Solar' origin which Tod constantly adopted for the leading clan of Mew\u0101r\u2014the Grahilot Guhilot, or Ah\u0101rya, or Sisodhya;\u00b9 for all these names successively adopted. We are told that the case is proved' by a twelfth-century local inscription, not found Mew\u0101r itself; this, however, proves, not the truth of legend, but its respectable antiquity.\n\nBriefly the story is that a certain Kankasena (or Kanaksena, known to the genealogies, but called in the bard's biruda 'lokalaputra'), said to be a descendant of R\u0101ma, emigrated a far distant western place called 'Lohkot'\u2014possibly hore (?), somewhere in the Indus region, and certainly in or near Oudh. From that position we are not prised to find the adventurer going direct to Northern\n\n\u00b9 Tod's statement is in vol. i, 177 ff. (reprint).\nThe description of the original manuscript is not visible in the image provided.\ncontemporary with the Ghakkar of the Panj\u0101b), who, at a long subsequent period, moved towards Gujar\u0101t and R\u0101jput\u0101na. Here they rose to power and became orthodox Hindus; and then the Court bards, knowing the real antiquity of the race and its fine qualities and physique, but not knowing any other origin, hastened to link on the traditional ancestors with the venerated name of \u2018R\u0101ma\u2019 and the Ayodhya legend.\n\nThe R\u0101jput clan of Ka\u00e7chhapagh\u0101ta or Ka\u00e7hw\u0101ha, affords another example of much the same kind, unless, indeed, we can assume a real connection with the Nikumbh or Raghuva\u1e41\u015ba. The clan has its origin in the Vindhyan country, or rather is first heard of there; and rose to power at Amber and Jaipur. There is no etymological (or any other) connection with Ku\u015ba, the son of R\u0101ma.\u00b9 Other examples will be mentioned under the head of \u2018R\u0101jput.\u2019 Behind all the stories, it is quite possible that there may be some racial affinity of early sun-worshipping tribes who came to India from the same original home, but at different periods; and that thus all, even the Ayodhya family, may have this remote degree of community of origin. In this connection it may be mentioned that even in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a account, intending to deal with Da\u015baratha father of R\u0101ma, and others, as orthodox kings, the sovereign is represented as in relation with a number of foreign princes who cannot be regarded as orthodox or even Hindu\u2014such as the king of the Kekaya in the far Panj\u0101b, and the king of Ang\u0101de\u015b, whose name \u2018Lompada\u2019 suggests a \u0160aka connection\u2014who all come to his \u2018aswamedh\u2019 sacrifice.\u00b2 He invites also (early) kings of K\u0101\u015b\u012b and Magadha (probably meaning pre-Lunar kings); and himself, in the course of preparation, visits Manipur, in the East Central Provinces, which is another of those slight indications of some Solar dominion in another \u2018Kosala\u2019 beyond the Vindhya.\n\n\u00b9 Which only arises from careless spelling of \u2018Cushw\u0101ha,\u2019 \u2018Kusha,\u2019 etc.\n\u00b2 A peculiarly \u2018Solar\u2019 institution, as the horse was sacred to the Sun. Is not this sacrifice (as Tod has illustrated) really of non-Brahmanic, Northern origin?\nTHE SOLAR TRIBES.\n\nThe Solar tribes, distinguished by special attributes, worshipped the Sun as their supreme deity. It seems they annually celebrated their festivals, and so became extolled in legend. They were renowned for their prowess and had an illustrious history among the ancient peoples of India. Would, o reader, allow me to present a genealogy of the Solar race? The greatness and glory of their kings is not detailed; even their names are lost to us. The subject to follow them through their tales and romantic adventures is a fascinating one, with legendary tales and legends of Hindu belief. I shall not dwell on India's history or the light of Asia, but shall turn our attention to other places where similar stories have been written and built up around the same characters. For the same reason, stories and romances of Buddha.\nLOCAL DISTRIBUTION OF RAJPUTS.\n\nIII. THE RAJPUT TRIBES.\n\nIt has to be remarked of 'Rajput' clans and septs in general, that they are almost entirely confined to Upper India, from the Panjab to Bih\u0101r, and to a belt of country south of the Jamna, represented by the region extending from Gujar\u0101t on the west to B\u0101ghelkhand beyond Rajput\u0101na. Only a very small minority of tribes is found in what can be supposed to be an original or even early location. In the North-West Provinces and Oudh nearly every 'Rajput' settlement dates from the time of the earlier or later Moslem conquests.\u00b9\n\nIt is worthy of remark that while other ruling races or clans are found in the Centre, in the East, and in the South, of India, no one calls them 'Rajput'; the term is limited, not only to the area of the original Aryan domination, but to that in which also the Jats, Meds, Gurjara, and others, also locally settled; so that the Brahmanic directors of social usage were driven to find some designation which would embrace various ruling clans and houses, the greater part of whom would only by a great stretch of fancy be connected with the long extinct or decayed tribes of the old Kshatriya stock.\n\nIt is noteworthy, as regards the Panjab, that it is only in the eastern districts bordering on the North-West Provinces\u2014the territory of the later Hindu tribes like the Tu\u0101r, \u010cauh\u0101n, etc., of Delhi and Kanauj\u2014that Rajput clans are found bearing the names that occur in Rajput\u0101na and the Madhyade\u015ba. In other parts, the tribes not only bear other names, but are evidently of a different kind. Sometimes, indeed, they appear to be remnants of really ancient tribes, not necessarily Brahmanic or Aryan. It is also remarkable that, numerically, the Rajputs of the Bhatti tribe (under\n\n\u00b9 I have given instances in Ind. Vill. Comm., pp. 99, 277.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nseveral sectional names) are the prevailing type. And these are of Y\u0101dava origin. Not, indeed, that they are frequently found in their original settlements; for most of them say they were first in Bhatti\u0101na, Jaisalm\u012br, etc., and came thence to their present homes. Where this is not the case, the \u2018R\u0101jput\u2019 is really the Indo-Scythian, thinly disguised by a tradition of certain clans (if they are still Hindu\\(^1\\)) which affirms descent from some hero of the Epics, or a \u2018Solar\u2019 descent from \u2018Ajudhya.\u2019 Here and there a wandering colony of tribes from R\u0101jput\u0101na, or even from Western India, may be found; and a very few really old (possibly Aryan) families in the hill country.\n\nThere is no doubt that a great majority of the clan names in the Panj\u0101b belong both to the \u2018R\u0101jput\u2019 and the \u2018Jat\u2019 sections. And this indicates that when the numerous B\u0101la, Indo-Scythian, G\u016bjar, and H\u016b\u1e47a tribes settled, the leading military and princely houses were accepted as \u2018R\u0101jput,\u2019 while those who took frankly to cultivation became \u2018Jat.\u2019 I think, too, that the inferior or doubtful local tribes called \u2018R\u0101ut\u2019 (or R\u0101wat) and \u2018Thakar\u2019 really represent descendants of some ancestor who might have attained rank, but had married a widow, or married in a lower class, or committed some other breach of clan \u2018etiquette\u2019 which caused his family to fall in the social scale.\n\nAnother similar instance of specialization occurs (as might be expected) in Gujar\u0101t and K\u0101th\u012bav\u0101\u1e0d: a certain number of special tribes not much known elsewhere\u2014Jhareja, Jh\u0101l\u0101, or Makw\u0101na, Rahb\u0101r, Padhi\u0101r, Narod\u0101, Jetw\u0101, etc.\u2014are there famous.\n\nAt this point I may introduce (chiefly on the authority of the Census and Ibbetson\u2019s Memoir) a list of the Panj\u0101b \u2018R\u0101jputs,\u2019 distinguishing (as is necessary) the hills and the plains, the West districts and the East, marking with an asterisk those names that are \u2018Jat\u2019 as well as \u2018R\u0101jput.\u2019\n\n\\(^1\\) Many clans have long become Mussulm\u0101n, and then often claim descent from some Mojem source.\nTHE DISTINCT CHARACTER OF PANJAB RAJPUTS.\n\nA.\n\nEastern Hills, Kangra and eastward, Hushyarpur, etc.\n\nKatoch (very likely really a relic of the old (Yadava?) kings of Trigartha)\u2014Pathaniya\u2014Goleria\u2014Dharwal\u2014Candela\u2014Pathial\u2014Jaswal\u2014Laddu\u2014Naru\u2014Ghorewaha (said to be Kachwaha)\u2014Mauj (or Kilqi)\u2014Taon (call themselves 'Bhatti' descendants of Sivalahan).\n\nB.\n\nDhund\u2014Sati\u2014Ketwal\u2014*Dhaniyal\u2014*Bokhral\u2014Budhal\u2014Alpiyal (seem to be Mani)\u2014Kanial.\n\n(B) Salt Range Country.\u2014Kahut\u2014Mair\u2014Kaer\u2014Jodra and Gheba.

The legend itself we will examine presently.\n\nAnother considerable group (especially in Oudh and the North-West Provinces) escape the effort to trace them very far, because their only tangible tradition derives the existing clan from a single adventurous chief, whose name is sometimes suggestive of non-Aryan origin, but that is all. Once more, it is practically certain that several clans, of respectable place in history, are really of mixed blood\u2014the descendants of some well-connected ancestor who married a female of inferior rank, or of foreign birth, or of no rank at all. To this class belong the Candela (or Candella), the Bundela (connected with the higher-ranked Rathor or Gaharwar), the Cham\u0101r-Gaur, and other 'Gaurs'; also the tribe with the very un-Aryan name (but sufficiently good rank) of 'Bargujar.'\n\nA further general observation as to locality of known origin\u2014the place where the tribe is first definitely heard of\u2014may be made. It is only reasonable to believe that the older fighting races must have become in some cases wholly, in others very nearly, extinct, both by the effect of internecine wars and the results of foreign invasions. Nevertheless it is, in the nature of things, extremely likely that scattered remnants of the pure blood (and these in time left descendants of mixed blood) should have taken refuge in and along the Hills to the North, and again in the Rajputana country and the Upper Vindhyan.\n\n1 On this subject I may refer to Cunningham's remarks in the Arch. Rep., vol. xx, quoted by Crookes (iv, 219).\nfastnesses. It is hardly necessary to remark that in these remote places, with the strong survival of clan feeling and rules of exogamy, it is possible for clans to remain with some evidence of origin for many centuries. They have not moved again, nor been subject to fresh vicissitudes. In Europe it is quite different; there, continual movement and the absence of clan customs and feeling, render undistinguishable fusion a consequence as inevitable as it is speedy. No one would undertake to trace out the probable descendants, say, of Alfred the Great or of the last Emperor of Constantinople. But in the Hills and remoter parts of India, out of the line of general traffic and the march of invading armies, the conditions are altogether different.\n\nIn the Himalayan States, we notice that not a few of the (individual) ruling chiefs belong to well-known (R\u0101jput\u0101na) tribes; and their presence is accounted for by the fact that they were driven from an earlier home by the Moslem invasions. It is quite possible that the same thing may have happened with still earlier tribal remnants, flying from much earlier calamities. To this latter origin, I believe, the Katoch families of Kangra,\u00b9 the \u010cibb, Manh\u0101s, etc., in the Panj\u0101b may be ascribed. After such a lapse of time it is quite likely that some may have fallen to the lower peasant rank, and have also become Mussulm\u0101n; while only a few retain traces of ancient royalty, and are still dignified chiefs.\n\nBut the Himalayas are distant; and a much nearer refuge-ground from defeat and slaughter in the battlefields of the Eastern Panj\u0101b, Rohilkhand, and the Ganges plain, would be found in Bundelkhand, B\u0101ghelkhand, and the country of K\u0101la\u00f1jara, Jaipur, Gw\u0101lior, Alwar, and R\u0101jput\u0101na generally. Here remnants of Aryan tribes would be much mixed up with Y\u0101dava driven out of the Panj\u0101b and the Indus Valley, and with other Northern tribes\n\n\u00b9 In Lyall's Kangra Sett. Report, the fanciful legend of origin is given; showing that they have (naturally) forgotten any real ancestry, and believe themselves older than either Solar or Lunar! But it is quite possible that they may really be a relic of the Y\u0101dava king of Trigarta, preserved in that quiet retreat.\nwho can be traced,\u2014followers of the \u015aak\u0101 Satraps, the B\u0101l\u0101 and K\u0101thi, the Mer, the Gurjara, and others. This may be more especially illustrated by the case of the M\u0101lwa country, part of which is a rich and desirable plateau land. We hear of kings of Avanti or Ujjayini in Epic times, but not of any such name as M\u0101lava applied to the whole country. It is difficult to say when, in literature, the country is first called M\u0101lava, or a tribe of that name mentioned in that particular locality. It is all the more so because the date of the different sections of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is not settled; moreover, there are several tribes with very similar names. We know specially of a Malla, or Mallaku, tribe under the Nep\u0101l Himalaya, and of the Malloi of Arrian, whose capital was Mallasth\u0101na, or Mult\u0101n. In the account of the victories of Bh\u012bma (Digvijaya-parva) two countries are mentioned both belonging to the \u2018Malla\u2019 tribes, one under the Himalaya, and another apparently near Thanesar, situated above the Ni\u1e63\u0101da country, near Vi\u1e47\u0101sana where the Saraswati river disappears in the sand.\n\nIn the Bhisma-parva (list of people and countries) \u2018Mallar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019 being placed next to Ke\u1e63\u0101la, seems to mean \u2018Mah\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.\u2019 Another allusion in the M. (Drona-parva, v. 2,427) I have not been able to verify. But quite a number of these tribes, called Malla, M\u0101lava (and similar forms), are mentioned in the Vishnu-P. And once in this work (book ii, ch. 3) there is a clear reference to \u2018M\u0101lwa\u2019 itself, since the M\u0101lava people have their dwelling in the Parip\u0101tra Mountains. In the Brihat Samhita I believe the name occurs without doubt, but that is a fifth or sixth century date.\n\n1 The \u2018country of Avanti\u2019 is still spoken of in Rudrad\u0101man\u2019s inscriptions, circa 150 A.D. Dh\u0101r and Ujjayini to the north, were in early times most probably approached from the Nerbada Valley by the opening in the hills at Mhau, through which the modern railway passes. Ujjayini lies a little way east of the Chambal Valley. The route to and from M\u0101lwa via Nimach and Ratlam would come into use later on.\n\n2 Wilson, V.P., p. 188.\n\n3 V.P., p. 185. The M\u0101la are mentioned between the Bodha and the Matsya. Wilson thinks this refers to Chattisgarh. On p. 193 we have M\u0101lava (var. lect. M\u0101laka, M\u0101java) and also Mallava (var. lect. Vallabha).\n\n4 V.P., p. 177.\nThe M\u0101lava tribe was apparently not under monarchical rule at first; and when kings arose they kept the use of the 'tribal' era which (for some reason) the tribe had adopted from the \u015aak\u0101 conquest and Hema Kadpisa (B.C. 57). We also hear of the same tribe as one of the frontier people of Samudragupta's empire, in the latter part of the fourth century. When the 'kings of M\u0101lava (eo nomine)' first appear, is not, I believe, known; nor is it certain that the tribe occupied the entire country. We have M\u0101lava (tribal) coins,\u00b9 which resemble those of the N\u0101ga princes of Padm\u0101vati (Narwar in Gwalior, Central India) contemporary with the Guptas.\u00b2 The first inscription that I have been able to trace mentioning a 'king of M\u0101lava' is dated v. 770 or A.D. 689. It seems, then, we have an example of a country some part of which only was anciently possessed, and which underwent a complete alteration by domination of a foreign tribe (or tribes), perhaps impelled to that quarter by this forward movement of other tribes. They may quite possibly be connected with the B\u0101l\u0101 and Valabhipura; and if they came from the South or South-East Panjab, they would have been impelled by the movement, or series of movements (that brought the Gurjara also), occurring during the early centuries of our era. That they had some connection with the \u015aak\u0101 appears from their adopting the era which afterwards the Ujjain astronomers took in hand and rendered permanent. Many similar changes must have taken place in neighbouring countries, and new ruling clans been introduced, especially about the period of the death of Harshadeva (or Harshavardhana), in the second half of the seventh century.\n\nThe eighth century is the general date when most of the R\u0101jput clans are first heard of historically. In this way R\u0101jput\u0101na\u2014east and west, M\u0101lwa, and the country further\n\n\u00b9 See J.R.A.S., Oct. 1897, pp. 860-882. The coins (not earlier than the fifth century) are described in Rapson (B\u00fchler's Encyclopaedia of Eastern Research), pp. 12, 13, to which Professor Macdonell kindly called my attention, as also to a notice in Bom. Gaz., vol. i, pt. 2, p. 311.\n\u00b2 Rapson, \u00a7 101.\nnorth, became the centre of the R\u0101jput tribes, including older 'Hindu' elements, as well as Indo-Scythian, Gurjara, and Jat (to a more limited extent), not to mention the Med (who gave name to Mev\u0101\u1e0d, or Mew\u0101r) and other H\u016b\u1e47a clans. When these tribes found their dominions (or their vassal possessions under the more powerful leaders) at Ujjain, Jodhpur, \u016adepur, \u0100jmer, Amber, K\u0101lanjara, and Gwalior, they became 'Hindus,' if not so already; their coins (where any exist) and inscriptions would give Sanskritized names, and already the way would be smoothed to a new rank or caste position in Hindu society. Only the humbler ranks, who were content with agriculture or cattle-grazing, would retain names suggesting their origin\u2014Jat, Mer, Gujar, etc. And there are a few tribes who rose to some importance, but were too far distant to attract literary notice, except from local and colloquial bards. It is to this circumstance that the distinct character of the Panj\u0101b R\u0101jputs may (in so many cases) be attributed. It explains also why tribes like the V\u0101\u1e37a of Dh\u0101\u1e45k, the Jetv\u0101, or the Jh\u0101\u1e37\u0101 of K\u0101thi\u0101war, all of whom are really Northern tribes, but locally allowed R\u0101jput rank and glorified by local bards, do not appear among the 'R\u0101jputs' of the central-northern region. I must take the opportunity of noting that the name 'Gurjara' was once an honoured one, though now (except for the little State of S\u0101\u1e41thar) there is no royal relic of the tribe. 'Gujars' are quite a low class. But it will often happen that the upper houses and clans of a Northern race have received new names (and that in several different branches),\n\n1 Jats seem to have preferred the Panj\u0101b and the Rohilkhand districts; they extended, however, to R\u0101jput\u0101na.\n\n2 In at least one of the lists of the 'thirty-six houses' the Gurjara were admitted to a place. At any rate they were sufficiently influential to make their name adhere to a country over the whole of which they never had dominion, and over part of which their dominion was not very long lived. There is of course no early literary use of Gurjar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, nor am I aware of its use by a later writer of pure Sanskrit. Gujr\u0101\u1e6d (or Gujar\u0101\u1e6dh) was constructed by Moslem historians on the same principle as Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra from the S'aura tribe. In the \u016adepur pras\u0101tti King Bhimdev I of Anhilpur (A.D. 1021\u20131063) is still called 'Lord of L\u0101\u1e6da and King of Gurjara.'\nwhile an older racial name has only adhered to the humbler classes of the same stock.\n\nFrom this central belt of country, the relics of older 'Hindu' tribes and the others mentioned were in time prepared to redistribute their growing numbers. For, with the Moslem conquest (which at first had the effect of further dispersing such Hindu leaders as were still in Hindustan) came the necessity for countenancing the more energetic clans, and enlisting their services under the Empire. Accordingly, from, say, the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries, we find our now thoroughly 'Hindu' tribes, under their later established names, gradually issuing forth\u2014sometimes in considerable bodies, sometimes in small parties under energetic leaders\u2014to return to 'Hindustan,' where the sites of the old Aryan kingdoms were either long grown over with dense jungle, or were partially occupied by agricultural settlements, ruled over by (reuscitated) D\u014dm, Th\u0101ru, P\u0101si, Bhar, or \u00c7eru chiefs, according to locality.\n\nR\u0101jput\u0101na and the vicinity thus became the locale where many new clans were built up,\u2014some of them unconnected by race with the 'Hindu' castes. But some clans, too, are clearly derived from the upper Dakhan and from the eastern end of the Vindhyas\u2014perhaps from Magadha itself. Of the latter, the \u0100ndhra form a noteworthy instance. Of the former, we have an example in the wide-branching R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6da, whom we can trace from the West Coast to Gujar\u0101t and the country east of it, whence a stroke of fortune took one branch to Kansauj and Jodhpur.\n\nOn the general question of origin, one other remark naturally occurs: it is that by the adoption of Hinduism, and by the occurrence of names in Sanskrit or Prakrit inscriptions, these clans may take on a much more 'Hindu' appearance than their origin sometimes warrants. We\n\n1 It is to be wished that we had some more definite authority or knew the source of the alleged division of the \u0100ndhra into the real family (the \u0100ndhraj\u0101tika) and the '\u0100ndhrabhritya.' It does seem as if there was some such disjunction in this widely dominating race. Wilson, V.P., p. 472 (note).\nfind in inscriptions long and splendid names compounded with 'deva,' 'simha,' 'varmma,' '\u0101ditya,' etc., etc., but we are not bound to suppose that these are the real personal names of the chiefs; indeed, every now and then we have a glimpse of what appear to be the actual names, such as Allata, Dhaniga, Karka, Kakka, Rajjila, Bauka, Latika, Silluka, Bhilluka, Kokalla, L\u0101h, etc., etc. Their very titles, R\u0101na (or R\u0101no), R\u0101o (locally R\u0101v), are forms more associated with those on the Ku\u1e63an and \u015aak\u0101 coins than with Sanskrit.\u00b9 Many of the Northern nations coming in later times to India must have had some ethnical affinity with the tribes more entitled to be described as 'Aryan,' 'Vai\u015bya,' etc. And at or before the beginning of our era, there would have been little or no barrier to a rapid fusion of races and clans. At most, the barriers would have been those of rank, dignity, and admitted clan-affinity\u00b2 (all the clans being exogamous). In due course of time all ranks became orthodox Hindus, and (as I have remarked in another connection) caste is strictly observed, while new names and fabulous descents from some sage or hero of the Epic days are invented. It is curious that Brahmanic orthodoxy, while it introduced (or supported) the practice of 'Sati,' the non-marriage of widows, and the veneration for the cow, did not banish some prior national customs\u2014the use of spirits and eating flesh (for example), or the worship of the sun, the horse,\n\n\u00b9 What is the real origin of the inferior title Th\u0101kur, which is applied also to the whole class in parts of the North-West Provinces, while Thakar appears in the Panjab as the name of an inferior group? Among the N\u0101ga princes of Gondw\u0101na 'Th\u0101kur' meant the priest attached to the royal household (Cent. Prov. Gaz., Introd., p. lxvi).\n\n\u00b2 In the late thirteenth century Karn, the unfortunate prince of the V\u0101ghela division of the C\u0101lukya, considered it beneath his dignity to give his daughter in marriage to a Y\u016bdava prince of Devagiri: he consented only as an alternative to seeing her married to a Moslem. But had the Devagiri chief (already called by the annalists Mahr\u0101tha) been of pure Y\u016bdava blood, such an objection would be unintelligible. Probably by that time they were of very mixed race. It is notorious in the pages of Tod, Malcolm, and others, with what facility R\u0101jp\u016bts of rank form unions, mostly irregular, with women of any class, and what numbers of inferior race\u2014'D\u0101sa,' 'Goli,' etc.\u2014are produced. Men of this birth may yet be of superior character and energy, and may originate houses, who rise far above the rank their origin would suggest, and attain to wealth and influence.\nand arms. Sir J. Malcolm remarks: \"To this day, every Rajput wears an amulet embossed with a figure of a horse and the sun. This mythological emblem is quite indispensable. It is, with all who can afford it, of gold; others are contented with silver; but the poorest Rajput makes this figure his first present to his infant male offspring. It is their personal deity, and receives their daily adoration. It is common also to wear the figure of a distinguished ancestor engraved on gold or silver... its utility is chiefly as a charm to keep at a distance ghosts and evil spirits.\"\n\nIt is also curious to observe that, speaking generally, the Rajput, when still Hindu, has his own pride of caste and occupation, which is connected rather with birth and rank than with purity as of a twice-born caste in the religious sense. At any rate, the existing Rajput standard is not at all that of the ideal Kshatriya of the 'Sh\u0101stra.' I need hardly refer to the evidence Tod has collected (and in such a matter his authority is unimpeachable) of the completely Northern or Scythian type which marks the customs of these proud tribes in the Rajputana States.\n\nIn Rajputana and Central India the actual rank and dignity of the Rajput families, and their position as chiefs, military commanders, or landlords, prevent the matter of caste-position from attracting notice; but in Gujarat and Western India, where the families have suffered eclipse and are more in the peasant condition, so that their actual caste rank is more easily observed, Kinloch Forbes has remarked that the 'Rajput' by no means takes the highest (caste) place.\n\n---\n\n1 The strict seclusion of females observed in the higher Rajput families (of which several extreme cases are given in the Rasmla for example) seems not so much to be the result of Hindu teaching as a measure of protection suggested by the conduct of the Moslems, at any rate during the earlier invasions and periods of local domination.\n\n2 \"Memoirs of Central India\" (reprint), ii, 119. I am not aware whether such a custom is observed by the Rajput tribes in the North-West Provinces, Oudh, or the Punjab, by those really entitled to the rank.\n\n3 The Rajputana Gazeteer calls attention to the still rather frequent traces of Jaina religion in Rajputana (vol. i, p. 89).\n\n4 Tod, vol. i, chap. vi (reprint), especially pp. 62 ff.\nTHE 'AGNIKUNDA' STORY.\n\nNext the Brahman, as he would do if recognized as really a Brahman. In Gop\u0101l\u0101, he says, that when speaking of the \"higher caste\" or \"higher-caste people\" in general, the proper phrase is not \"Brahman-R\u0101jput,\" but \"Br\u0101hman-Warrior,\" as the Br\u0101hmans caste has the next rank. The warrior will not even take water from the hand of a R\u0101jput. All this points to the fact that any superior tribe is able to assert its pre-eminence and establish a local rule, but will not literally take the place of the old military caste. And this is still more obvious in the case of the present landholding R\u0101jpouts in the Rajputana and North-West Provinces.\n\nWe may next turn to the specific account of the origin of the chief R\u0101jpouts tribes, which is indicated (or concealed?) in the story of the Agnikunda. In effect it states that the ancestors of the tribes were miraculously produced from the fire-engineer or sacrificial pit (Agnikunda) on the banks of the river. Their names do not admit of chronology; and the various individuals who figure in the story, are evidently the result of the lapse of time and change of circumstances.\n\nThe story is told at Mount Abu, belonging to the same category inside the theatre of religious legends. But in itself it is one of those stories whose worth are sure, sooner or later, to be seen in the course of legendary occurrence of shrines and shrines. On the other hand, it is not in itself worth\n\n---\n\nSarasvata Pur\u0101\u1e47a at p. 553.\n\nIt was connected in one way or another with the idea of taking away the sin committed in answer to Vasistha's warning. It is not in itself worth\nmuch attention. It is not at all ancient,\\(^1\\) nor is it uniformly adhered to by the mediaeval relators of it. If it has any meaning at all, it indicates that certain tribes or families became Hindus, or at least espoused at the time, the Brahmanic cause. Tod tells us that \"they were to defend the altars of Bal (\u012a\u015bvara) against the Dytes (Daitya).\"\n\nIt will be easily seen, from a brief review of the four clans, successively, how late this legend is; how other legends and origins compete with it; and how, through several variations, the underlying sense seems to be this, that several non-Aryan, or mixed, or perhaps purely Scythic, clans were adopted by the Brahmans, sometimes under the guise that they were warriors born of a Brahman father, or that they were descendants of the priestly-warrior class (\u0100\u1e45gira, Bhrigu, etc.), mentioned in literature.\n\n(1) The Parih\u0101ra (or Pratih\u0101ra) are hardly known; they early disappeared from history, but survive in a few inscriptions. They are found first in Jodhpur (Marw\u0101r). Some other (Central Indian) states, Uchchahra, Khoh, and others, are thought to have been Parih\u0101ra.\\(^2\\) The Mew\u0101r Grahilot rose to fame by ejecting a Parih\u0101ra prince from Mandor and Mew\u0101r. The Mandor inscription (now at Jodhpur) and that of Ghatay\u0101la, know nothing of the Agnikula legend.\\(^3\\) The personal names mentioned suggest a Gurjara connection; but the origin asserted is from a Brahman father by a 'Kshatriya' mother (though the actual chiefs are Jainas!).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tod's account of it is in vol. i, p. 82 (reprint). Is the story older than Chand and the other bards? See R\u0101sm\u0101la, p. 536.\n\n\\(^2\\) Curiously enough, one list of 'the thirty-six' gives a place both to Parih\u0101ra and Pratih\u0101ra (R\u0101sm\u0101la, p. 535); Cunningham suggested that they might be the Poruaroii of Ptolemy; but Lassen, with more probability, referred that name to the much better known Pram\u0101ra. This, if substantiated, would take back the Pram\u0101ra to before the second century. Dr. Gustav Oppert (\"Original Inhabitants of India,\" pp. 22-3, note, and p. 92) has an altogether different suggestion. Chand the bard makes the Pram\u0101ra superiors of the Parih\u0101ra, and accounts for the settlement of the latter in 'Mard\u0113\u015b' as by grant of the former; but then he places a Pram\u0101ra as king of Ujjain and suzerain. The Parih\u0101ra were, in fact, driven out of Marw\u0101r when the R\u0101thor princes of Kanauj came to an end, in mediaeval times.\n\n\\(^3\\) See J.R.A.S., 1894, p. 1 ff. and 1895, p. 514. The first inscription is probably of the ninth century. That from Ghatay\u0101la (No. 13 in Kielhorn's list) is Vik. 918.\n(2) The Pram\u0101ra (or Param\u0101ra) are much more widely known, and are found (under the colloquial form Pu\u0101r or Pu\u00f1w\u0101r) in various places, both in names in the West and in the North. The history seems possibly to go further back than in the other cases. It is possible that there is some connection with the early \u2018Sodrai\u2019 or with the \u2018Sogdoi\u2019 of Alexander\u2019s time. But if these are really the Sodh\u0101 of the Indus Valley, the \u2018Pram\u0101ra\u2019 (as such) would be a later branch of them, not vice versa; for in fact the existing Sodh\u0101 R\u0101jputs of Sindh only came from M\u0101lwa in the thirteenth century. The Pram\u0101ra are represented as intermarrying with the Y\u0101dava and other royal houses. The Valabhi king has a Pram\u0101ra queen who escapes from the destruction of the city (probably in the end of the eighth century), and is in fact the mother of the ancestor of the Mew\u0101r clan. The Pram\u0101ra and Cedi also intermarried. The Udepur prasa\u1e45ti is not dated, but may be about the eleventh century. It adopts the fire-legend, but with an important variation\u2014making only this one tribe produced from the fire. The royal names mentioned suggest that the Pram\u0101ra kings began to rule in M\u0101lwa in the eighth or ninth century, but possibly a century earlier.\n\n(3) The Chauhan (C\u0101hum\u0101na of inscriptions) appear first at \u2018\u015a\u0101kambari\u2019 near Ajmer. No direct assertion of any other origin than that of the fire-legend has come to my notice; but Cunningham states that the common gotr\u0101-ch\u0101rya of the Chauhan houses makes the ancestor to be of the Vatsa race through five famous progenitors (\u201cB\u0101\u00e7 gotra\n\n---\n\n1 It is curious that Chand (if I may trust Tod, i, 84, note) calls the Pram\u0101ra \u2018of Telingana,\u2019 as if they had something to do with the Andhra and Ch\u0101lukhy\u0101. Tod\u2019s list of their branches includes the Mori (Maurya). It is true that relics of this old race appear long after the time of A\u015boka, as princes in the Konkan, and also at Cithar in the Vindhy\u0101 Hills; but if there is any connection with the Pram\u0101ra, the latter must be a branch of the Maurya, not vice versa.\n\n2 See McCrindle, \u201cThe Invasion of Alexander,\u201d etc., p. 354, and the Rasm\u0101la, p. 227; but see the Sindh Gazetteer, p. 862. The Dh\u0101t State is still held by Sodh\u0101 R\u0101jputs.\n\n3 Ep. Ind., i, p. 222 ff. It has various interesting items; among them an attack on the Haihaya king of Cedi by the Pram\u0101ra vassal V\u0101kpati at the end of the tenth century.\n\n4 As reported in Beames\u2019 Elliot, Gloss., i, 68.\np\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d pravara\"). Mukhj\u012b, the \u010cauh\u0101n bard, adopts the fire-legend, but again makes the \u010cauh\u0101n the only product. The 'Vatsa' legend, however, equally suggests the idea of a more or less foreign tribe adopted by the Brahmans by means of the favourite descent from priestly-warrior ancestors. The earlier name seems to have been Bach or B\u0101ch, which suggested 'Vatsa' as an origin; or perhaps, vice versa, B\u0101ch was derived from 'Vatsa.'\n\nProbably the tribe originated in the eastern ultra-Vindhyan region and came to \u0100jmer. The Harsha inscription (Vik. 1030) describes an ancestor of the reigning \u010c\u0101hum\u0101na king as G\u016bvaka I, \"famous as a hero in the assemblies of the N\u0101g\u0101 and other princes.\" The name 'Vatsar\u0101ja' also occurs in the list of the family.\n\nElliot gives an account of the main branches of the clan in descent from Prithw\u012b Chand, and of the various estates acquired when once the clan obtained a footing in Hindust\u0101n. This latter was something of an accident, in the twelfth century, since the Tu\u0101r prince of Delhi gave way to his son-in-law, a \u010cauh\u0101n, because he had no son of his own.\n\nThe clan name frequently appears in the stories of the Gujar\u0101t bards. Its leaders were ever ready to offer resistance to the Moslem, and had their efforts been better seconded by other 'Hindu' tribes, and anything like unanimity maintained, the result of the Moslem battles of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries might have been different from what it was. After the defeat at Delhi the clan was dispersed, but its chief centres still remain in the States of Har\u0101uti, Kotah, and Bundi, in R\u0101jp\u016bt\u0101na.\n\n(4) The \u010calukya (or \u010c\u016blukya) tribe is one that is almost certainly of foreign or non-Brahmanic origin; it peculiarly belongs to Western India, or the ultra-Vindhyan country. We have the reigning house first coming to power in the\n\n---\n\n1 Bh\u0101rgava, \u010cyavana, Apravana, Aurva, and Jamadagnya.\n2 And there is a traditional 'Veni Vach Raya' (Bach) who was the original founder of Idar. Curiously enough, one of the early \u010cauh\u0101n ancestors (Anhil) is placed at Garhamandala, i.e. with the Vatya-Cedi people. I cannot find any detail about this.\n3 Ep. Ind., ii, 117. Harsha is a hill in the Jaipur State.\nsixth century\\(^1\\) and then dividing into two. In the seventh century the 'Western' Chalukya are ruling in the Dakhan, and the 'Eastern' extend to the so-called Carnatic coast. We have some indications of an early dominion in part of Gujar\u0101t before the 'Solankhi' princes ruled over the whole. The R\u0101sm\u0101la gives the bardic story relating how this happened;\\(^2\\) and it is by no means improbable. There seems to be no reason to doubt that 'Solankhi' is merely a colloquial form of \u010c\u0101luky\u0101; the bards use the two forms quite indifferently. The V\u0101ghela (B\u0101ghela) house was an offshoot of this stock in Gujar\u0101t. Once more, in the case of this royal house, we have a variety of legendary origins: one shows the device of a Brahman adoption, making the ancestor connected with the priestly-warrior class. Another, later, account is merely the usual fire-legend of the four Agnikula. Sir Walter Elliot thought the origin to be 'Lunar,' meaning Y\u0101dava, but there is no ground given for this suggestion. On the other hand, in the Bilhari (Cedi) inscription,\\(^3\\) the tribe is derived from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata times and a quarrel between Drona and Drupada. Drona (the brahman or sage) takes water in his hand to curse Drupada, and from the handful (\u00e7uluka) of water \"there arose a man like victory incarnate, and from him proceeded the clan (kula) of the \u010caulukya, the excellencies of which are countless.\" Dr. Bh\u0101nd\u0101rkar, again,\\(^4\\) refers to a more general account (\"opening lines of all the copper-plates\"), that the tribe were derived from the Solar line and are descendants of that Harita who appears (in the V.P.) as one of the kings (great-grandson of Mandh\u0101tri) regarding whom the confusing statement is made\\(^5\\) that the \u0100ngirasa Brahmans were descended from him. Here we have the same idea which marks the Drona story, since there also the sage or priest gives birth to the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See also Bom.

Here the '\u00c7uluk' comes in as the handful of sacrificial water taken by the god Brahmadeva.\n\n\\(^5\\) See Wilson, V.P., p. 369, note.\nwarrior. The derivation from 'Ayodhya' (but not here connected with the usual R\u0101ma or Lava) seems to be because the C\u0101lukya were really originally Sun-worshippers,\u2014very possibly a branch of the Andhra. There is no question that they have absolutely no connection with the Eastern Aryans proper.\n\nSo much for the Agnikula races. I should add that some of the bards wish to make Y\u0101dava a fifth 'Agnikula' (as stated in the R\u0101sm\u0101l\u0101), which is quite natural, if, as I have surmised, we are really intended to understand ruling races of non-Brahmanic (and very often non-Aryan) origin, grafted on to the Hindu system by the adoption of Brahmanical religion. But it is curious that there are certain races (always called R\u0101jput) who have never been included with the 'Agnikula.' Two of these are especially noteworthy: the Tu\u0101r or Tumara, celebrated as princes of Delhi; and the R\u0101thor, who appear to me to be clearly Y\u0101dava, and who, at any rate, did not need the support of an artificial origin.\n\nAs to the R\u0101thor (or R\u0101thaur), the name (though naturally later descendants invented fanciful meanings, as raht, 'the spine of Indra,' etc.) is clearly from the old form Ra\u1e6d\u1e6da, or R\u0101\u1e6dhi, which was Sanskritized (in the inscriptions) into R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drika, or R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6da, and that again made into the colloquial form R\u0101thor. There is an early, but short, list of kings (not dated, but probably of the late fifth or else the seventh century) showing the (already well-known) family at M\u0101napura, a locality not ascertained but apparently in the Dakhan.\u00b9 It is true, negatively, that this makes no mention of a Y\u0101dava descent; and the seal was a lion, not the Garuda of later families; but this latter is of little import, since branches change their emblem with their faith (as the C\u0101lukya took the 'Boar' symbol to mark their adoption of Vai\u015bnavite religion), or for some other cause. Really there is no reason to doubt that Abhimanyu\u00b2 and\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gaz., vol. i, pt. I, p. 120; pt. 2, p. 386.\n\u00b2 Observe that the uncommon name of 'Abhimanyu' is itself that of one of the Y\u0101dava ancestors, and (much later) that of a son of Arjuna.\n\nJ.M.A.S. 1899.\nother kings of the inscription are of the same stock as the later R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6da. They are admitted to have been a very early indigenous clan in the Dakhan, who came into conflict with the \u010c\u0101lukya and others; they acquired greater power, and naturally branched out widely. I see no reason to suppose that there was another, Northern, family of a similar name. From the widespread victories of some of the kings, as recorded in the inscriptions, there is no reason why a branch should not have gone to the north from the Dakhan. Of course, the idea that they held Kanauj in the fifth century is not sustainable; but they and the branch called Gahadavala (Gaharw\u0101r) certainly held Kanauj for several successions\u2014not more than five, I think\u2014in the eleventh century. After that, being defeated, they went to Jodhpur; and it is quite possible that they had families in the neighbourhood long before. The later inscriptions certainly contain Y\u0101dava genealogies. One calls the family Tu\u1e45ga; another takes it from Saty\u0101k\u012b. The inscription alluded to by Cunningham also seems to regard the Gujar\u0101t R\u0101\u1e6dhors, when they overthrew the V\u0101la princes, as restoring the fortunes of\n\n---\n\n1 I have remarked on these names in the list of 'R\u0101jput' tribes at the end.\n\n2 When scattered parties in the course of time wandered as far as Hindustan, and even to the distant Panjab, very naturally different clan-names would arise; and those who still remembered 'R\u0101\u1e6dhor' would forget the history, and invent vague fables about Ku\u015ba and K\u0101ma, and 'Hiranya Ka\u015bipu,' which have no meaning whatever.\n\n3 For the Saty\u0101k\u012b descent see Ep. Ind., iii, 268 ff., and the Tu\u1e45ga, see Ep. Ind., iv, 286 (Karh\u016bd plate). Other references for the Y\u0101dava descent are given in a note to Bom. Gaz., vol. i, pt. 2, p. 194.\n\n4 See Anc. Geogr., p. 317 (where there is much that has since been corrected, but that does not affect the present point). Full details are given in Bom. Gaz., vol. i, pt. 1, p. 119 ff. In vol. i, pt. 2, p. 386, a somewhat divergent account is given. Dr. Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l considered the undated inscription to be of about 450 A.D. Dr. Fleet thinks it about the seventh century. Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l takes the 'M\u0101napura' city to be the capital of the ancestor (of Abhimanyu)=M\u0101nanka-pura, perhaps the M\u0101lkhad (below Sholapur) of the later R. kings. Dr. Fleet suggests some place in Central India (M\u0101npur, in M\u0101lwa). This latter is very unlikely. Whether the 'Ratta' were a Dravidian clan, or connected with the early Aratta (B\u0101hika) of Epic times, or an early Y\u0101dava Aryan (and no real reason is given against the latter suggestion), M\u0101lwa is a most unlikely place; their whole early history is closely associated with the Dakhan. It is true that the Y\u0101dava descent is noted (but independently, and not with the vagueness that purely legendary accounts exhibit) in inscriptions of a date when Brahminic caste was prevalent, and tribes began to desire an 'orthodox' origin; but this is not conclusive against all the natural probabilities of the case.\nthe country, which had lost its appellation of Su-r\u0101jya, the beautiful kingdom (Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra). This looks as if the kings were restorers of what was really an older and long-established race of 'Y\u0101dava,' whose connection with Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was ancient and traditional; before the (unquestionably 'foreign') 'Kshatrapas,' the Vallabhi princes, and the Traik\u016b\u1e6dakas, interfered.\u00b9\n\nThe Tu\u0101r, or Tomara, are always connected with Delhi (Indraprastha). Crookes says they are Yadub\u0101\u1e47i, but gives no authority or reason.\u00b2 They appear at Delhi with the (very legendary) rebuilding of the forsaken city of Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata times \u2014 Indraprastha (supposed to have occurred in the eighth century). After that, a long line of princes seems to have emerged, bearing the clan-name of Tu\u0101r, and with the syllable 'p\u0101la' at the end of their names (Anang- or Ananda-p\u0101la, etc.). It is very unlikely that they represent any direct continuation of the old Kshatriya kings, since the traditions describe an utter dispersion and a laying waste of the country. But Lassen notices that a tribe of Tomara (not Tom\u0101ra) appear with the Kir\u0101ta and other remote people in the V.P. (from the Bhi\u1e63ma-parva of the M.),\u00b3 and suggests that they were in the Sirmor hills, north-west of the Jamna. He thinks also that there was some connection with the Ka\u015bmir kingdom (in the R\u0101j\u0101tara\u1e45gini).\u2074 Chand, the bard, places a 'Tu\u0101r'\n\n\u00b9 The Bom. Gaz., vol. i, pt. 1, p. 150 ff., has given details about the Ch\u0101vada princes (or, as a Naus\u0101ri inscription calls them, Chavotaka), whom the bards represent as successors of the Val\u0101; but has not co-ordinated them with the R\u0101\u1e63trak\u016b\u1e6da successors. The former must have either ruled independently in the northern part of the peninsula, or been in dependence on the latter. The Ratnam\u0101la (about A.D. 1230), speaking of the struggle between King Bhuvada or Bh\u016bvar (Calukhy\u0101) and the Pan\u00e7\u0101sar prince (early in the eighth century?), puts the king at 'Kaly\u0101ni,' because that was the only place he knew of, though it was not really a Calukya capital before the eleventh century. Perhaps, as conscious of this, he purposely confused the matter by referring also to 'Kanyakubja,' which, geographically, is nonsense, but suggests another general locale for ancient kings. I think his 'Bhuvada' is a colloquial contraction for Buddhavarman (A.D. 713). I believe the Caura (or Ch\u0101vda) are the really original tribe of S'aur who gave their name to the country, and are contemporaries of the earliest Y\u0101dava inhabitants, and that the name S'\u016bra of the Y\u0101dava genealogy has a possible reference to them.\n\n\u00b2 Vol. iv, p. 412.\n\n\u00b3 Wilson, p. 196.\n\n\u2074 Lassen, iii, 897.\nprince at the fort of Paw\u0101gadh, in West Gujar\u0101t, bearing\nthe name of R\u0101m Gaur; as if the Tu\u0101r were a scattered\nrace, perhaps the same as the Hindu (Gaur) Raj\u0101s of\nBengal, and of uncertain origin. It is, of course, possible\nthat some relic of the old Aryan stock may have escaped to\nthe Himalaya, and thence, after many centuries, reappeared\nin the Delhi country. But, when it happened that any\ntribe obtained a later dominion there, it would be almost\ninevitable that (in an inscription, as Tod mentions)\u00b9 the\nprinces should call themselves, or be represented as,\nP\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava. Altogether the real origin of the clan is quite\nuntraceable; it stood in memory solely because of its\nconnection with the rule at Delhi.\n\nOne other tribe locally famous in Oudh, and at one time\nof the greatest political importance, is the BAIS. It is\nreckoned as \u2018Rajput,\u2019 especially the \u2018Tilok-\u00e7andi\u2019 clans,\nalthough the tribal name indicates Vai\u015bya, not Kshatriya\norigin. In the course of time, what with the desolating\nwars of the Aryan kings and the long course of foreign\ninvasion, it is obvious that any tribes that survived and\nmultiplied and remained entitled to call themselves \u2018Aryan,\u2019\nwould rather belong to the Brahman or Vai\u015bya (Aryan\ncommon people), the non-combatant, or less continuously\nexposed, classes of the race. And in course of time it might\nwell happen that particular families would rise to eminence,\nand yet being conscious of Vai\u015bya caste, were too proud\nto claim a \u2018Kshatriya\u2019 rank that did not belong to them.\nThe Vishnu Pur\u0101na\u00b2 tells us the \u2018Gupta\u2019 is a proper name\nfor Vai\u015byas, which suggests that the (later) Gupta emperors\nwere also Vai\u015bya. And we have Hwen Thsang\u2019s authority,\nand that of the Harsha\u00e7aritra, for calling the celebrated\nHarshadeva (seventh century) a Vai\u015bya. We find also some\nindications that in the process of time, when very mixed\nraces must have been numerous in the North and West of\n\n\u00b9 Vol. i, p. 31, in the original edition; this I have not seen, unless vol. i,\np. 29, of the reprint is the same; but there is no specific mention of an inscription\nasserting P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava origin.\n\u00b2 Wilson, V.P., p. 422.\nIndia, the term 'Vai\u015bya' came into use, as indicating quite a separate race. In the Brihat \u015a\u0101\u1e41hita we find, in the west, 'Vai\u015bya' named as a people along with the 'Aparantaka' or inhabitants of the Konkan. There were 'Vai\u015bya' as a house or clan at Sth\u0101ni\u015bvara (Thanesar); and to this, as I have said, Harshadeva belonged. There is no reason whatever to object to this indicating 'Vai\u015bya' in the sense of the Aryan third caste, on the ground of the king's marriage into the 'R\u0101jput' families of Vallabhi and Kanauj. Both the latter were more or less foreigners, and were certainly not superior to pure 'Vai\u015bya.' The Gupta kings married in the same way; and even at the present day the Tilok-\u00e7andi 'Bais' of Oudh marry into good R\u0101jput families, and are regarded quite as of 'R\u0101jput' rank. I think it extremely likely that Tilok-Chand himself, who was an unassuming person, and never himself (as Mr. Benett expressly tells us) took the title of R\u0101j\u0101, was aware that he had no pretensions to actual Kshatriya descent, and was content to be a Vai\u015bya or 'Bais.' The Tilok-\u00e7andi house, however, maintained stoutly its supremacy as well as its descent from \u015a\u0101li\u1e45vahana, from 'Paithan' in the 'Dakhan.' Tradition has magnified this hero out of all proportion; in any case he was not by descent a pure Aryan, though traditionally connected with the Yadava. The Bais do not profess to have come to Oudh before the thirteenth century.\n\nBesides these three clans not included as Agnikula, there are, of course, the Jadon or Yadub\u0101n\u012b tribes, so called, and other clans with specific names who claim descent from Yadu. There are also one or two that are called 'Sombansi' vaguely claiming descent as 'Lunar.' In this case it is sometimes\n\n1 It is curious that the Waniyo (Baniya or Vai\u015bya) in Gujar\u0101t and the corresponding caste in the Dakhan are always regarded as very superior.\n2 See the note to p. 68, Ep. Ind., vol. i. The objection, I submit, is quite untenable, and the evidence clear.\n3 There is a good account in his \"Chief Families of the Roy Bareilly District\" (Lucknow, 1870). A curious mark of Dakhan origin is noted by Crookes (vol. i, 120), that the Bais women retain a garment in one piece, which is evidently the graceful 's\u0101r\u012b,' the characteristic female dress of the West and South.\ndoubtful whether the Yadu descent is meant or the Puru. Lastly, there are clans, some of considerable importance (like the Nikumbh), who, with more or less reason, claim to be Suryavanshi or Solar. I have already offered general remarks on this claim, when speaking of the Solar races. What further detailed notes have been made are placed under the head of the tribal name in the concluding 'List.'\n\nIt has only further to be added that though in so many cases a foreign or a doubtful origin belongs to these tribes, and though the claim to be Aryan Kshatriya is rarely, if ever, tenable, that does not really detract either from the dignity and historic reputation they have attained, or indeed from a still highly respectable antiquity. If their history can only give them an origin in the sixth or eighth century, that at least is as old as our Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy; and many an English family would think its descent of the first water if it could be, with tolerable certainty, carried back even half that distance. Whether Solar or Lunar, Aryan or Scythian, the tribes cannot lose the credit of heroic self-sacrifice, of devoted and patient energy in defence against the Moslem\u2014qualities which have made them famous alike in the ballads of their bards and the pages of more matter-of-fact history.\nTENTATIVE GROUPING OF RAJPUT TRIBES.\n\nP. = Panj\u0101b; N. = N.-West Provinces; O. = Oudh; Rj. = Rajput\u0101na;\nW. = Gujar\u0101t and Western India.1\n\nI.

Jhanj\u016ba, or Janjh\u016ba (P.): see also R\u0101\u1e6dhor.\n7. Jhareja (W.).\n8. R\u0101\u1e6dhor (R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6da).\n\nMany branches, originating in the Dakhan, have extended to Gujar\u0101t and beyond, and so towards Rj.; and a branch furnished some five princes in succession, to Kanauj; thence driven to Marw\u0101r. A vestige is found in Budaon District (N.). Hardly known in the P., except individual Raj\u0101s in the Hill States and a few in the Eastern districts. The Jhanj\u016ba claim to be R\u0101\u1e6dhor is noted at p. 535, ante. In Rj. they are the most numerous clan, not only in Marw\u0101r, but in \u0100jmer (whence they expelled the \u010caub\u0101n\u2014Rj. Gaz., ii, 35), and in Bik\u0101ner and Jaisalmer.\n\n1 References are to Beames' Elliot's Glossary, to Crookes' \"Tribes and Castes of the North-West Provinces and Oudh,\" 4 vols., and to Ibbetson's \"Outlines of Panj\u0101b Ethnography,\" 1881 (1 vol., 4to).\nThe G\u0101harw\u0101r clan (Tod's Gherw\u0101l) are most probably only a branch or section of the family, the distinction being caused by the fact that some of them became (or remained) Buddhist (Crookes, iv, 237). The Buddhist descendants would naturally try and connect their lineage with Buddha's country and the Solar stock, whence the occasional statement that the 'R\u0101\u1e6dhor' are 'Solar,' from Oudh or Kosala. They expelled the Tomara from Kanauj (in 1050 A.D.). Pr. Chand, the \u010cauh\u0101n R\u0101j\u0101 of Delhi, carried off a R\u0101\u1e6dhor princess, leading to war between the two kingdoms, and the defeat of both by the Moslem. The R. were driven to Jodhpur, where there is an R. inscription as early as V. 1053 (circa 997 A.D.), (No. 53 in Kielhorn's List, Ep. Ind., vol. v). In the inscriptions (75, 77, 80, 83, Kielhorn) the 'Candradeva' who acquired Kanauj in the eleventh century, is distinctly called a G\u0101harwar (G\u0101ha\u1e0dv\u0101la), while Elliot (i, 123) calls him 'the Rathor.' But again, in an inscription (dated from Benares, Vik. 1171) of the grandson of Candradeva, the family is not called 'G\u0101ha\u1e0dv\u0101la'; and so in later ones (e.g., No. 148 in Kielhorn's list, Vik. 1224); the families were perhaps then separated.\n\nII. Reputed Lunar.\n\n(Candraba\u1e47si or Somba\u1e47si.)\u00b9\n\n1. B\u0101chal (N., O.). A clan of some repute; once had a coinage of their own; known from the tenth century. Their gotr\u0101chary\u0101 always calls them 'Somba\u1e47si.'\n\n2. Somba\u1e47si (N., O.). A clan of considerable antiquity, adopting this generic name only; came from a settlement at Jh\u016bsi, near All\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d; and seem really to have some claim to have dwelt immemorially about the region they still inhabit (to the number of 84,000).\n\n\u00b9 i.e., other than Y\u0101dava.\nIII. Reputed Solar (S\u016brajba\u1e47si).\n\n1. Ahbans (O.). Placing themselves under this head owing to a curious tradition (not likely to be invented) that they are descended from the tribe of \u015aaura (Ch\u0101vada) in Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, who were Sun-worshippers.\n\n2. Dikhit (or Dikshit) (N., O.). Once a powerful race, the country of their adoption being called Dikhity\u0101na. Their tradition is that they descend from a R\u0101j\u0101 who was fifty-first in line of descent from Ikshw\u0101ku, and who (as usual) went to \u2018Gujar\u0101t.\u2019 Long afterwards the family, returning to pay homage to the King of Ujjain, their original name \u2018Dargba\u1e47si\u2019 was changed to \u2018Dikhit\u2019; they ultimately wandered to Oudh.\n\n3. Gahlot (Guhilot or Grahilot). Name in Mew\u0101r changed to Sisodhya.\n\nGuhil, or Gohil (W.). Celebrated in Gujar\u0101t stories.\n\nWe have a king Guhila (in Rj.) in inscriptions of Vik. 1008 and 1010; and there is an early Guha or Guhasena among the Vallabhi kings (sixth century). The Gohils of Bh\u0101vnagar are said to be \u2018admittedly\u2019 of the same stock as the Vallabhi princes. If that be so (which seems doubtful), the Gohil and Gahlot are of the same origin. K. Forbes (R\u0101smal\u0101, p. 237) says that he has found annals deriving the Gohil from \u015a\u0101liv\u0101hana (who is a Y\u0101dava according to the usual account). The Gahlot came to a settlement in Marw\u0101r, expelling certain Bhil chiefs, and held it until the R\u0101thor drove them out. In Marw\u0101r their neighbours were the \u2018D\u0101bhi.\u2019 The Gahlot finally settled in Mew\u0101r. No Gohils are known beyond Gujar\u0101t (Bh\u0101vnagar).\n\n---\n\n1 There is a king \u2018Dirghab\u0101hu\u2019 in the V.P. list, but not fifty-first. Whether \u2018Dargba\u1e47si\u2019 may be Dirghaba\u1e47si, and refer to him, I cannot say.\n\n2 See p. 530, ante.\n\n3 See R\u0101smal\u0101, 237, and cf. Rajp. Gaz., vol. ii, p. 266. Of the D\u0101bhi I can discover no trace beyond what is in Tod, i, 106 (reprint).\n4. Ka\u00e7hw\u0101ha. Some remarks have been made under the head of 'Solar.' We have inscriptions of Ka\u00e7chapagh\u0101ta (or Ka\u00e7hap\u0101ri) from Gw\u0101lior (Vik. 1034 and onwards). One mentions the clan as the ally of the Candella. Another in Vik. 1150 mentions that the king (of the 1034 inscription) conquered Gopadri (Gw\u0101lior). They appear also in the chronicles as in 'Antarbed' (in the Do\u0101b), and allied with Prithwi Chand of Delhi. They expelled the Bargujar and M\u012bna from Amber and Jaipur. They are still prevalent in the north-east states of Rj., especially in Jaipur and Alwar; a sept called Shekh\u0101wat is in North Jaipur. In Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur (N.) is an inferior branch called K\u0101s\u012bp. The Ghorew\u0101ha of J\u0101landhar (P.) claim to be another branch (Ibbetson, \u00a7 457).\n\n5. Mandahar (East P., also in part of Rohilkhand) claim as cognate, the Kandahar, Bargujar, \u015aa\u1e45karw\u0101l, and Panihar: of these I find no notice. They say they are descended from Lava, and left Oudh in the (late) times of the Candela (Crookes, iv, 473).\n\n6. Nikumbh. This clan was mentioned at p. 528, ante, because of a detailed tradition that they belong to the Solar race (through Sagara, who came into conflict with the T\u0101la\u1e45gha); and it is noteworthy that the name Nikumbha is found among the Ku\u1e47bi of Bombay, as if there had at one time been some Solar settlement in the West. They now appear in Alwar and East Rj., and were in Mew\u0101r before the Gahlot.\n\n7. Raghuva\u1e47si (O., East P.) claim to be the same stock as No. 6, and connected with the 'Raghuva\u1e47si' dynasty of Harshadeva (A.D. 606\u2013650), who, however, appears to be Vai\u015bya.\n\n8. Raikw\u0101r (O.), a purely local clan, who say they came from a village called Raik\u0101, in K\u0101\u015bmir: as sun-worship prevailed there, there may be some 'Solar' connection, not necessarily Aryan.\n\n---\n\n1 Crookes (iv, 86), alluding to a K\u0101\u00f1dh\u0113\u015b inscription of the thirteenth century. See Bom. Gaz., vol. i, pt. 2, pp. 470, 521, and vol. xxiv, p. 65 note, p. 414.\n9. Sirnet (East O.) call themselves a branch of the Nikumbh, but curiously have a tradition that their branch came from a dominion in West Assam.\n\n10. S\u016brajb\u0101nsi (N., O.). As many as 44,000 in the census gave only this generic designation.\n\n[I must add also, but cannot specifically classify, a limited clan of 'Baria' Rajputs found in Jalandhar (P.), who have a curiously definite tradition that they are derived from Kar\u1e47a, whom they call 'king of A\u1e45ga,' born (miraculously) of Kunti or P\u1e5bthi, by the Sun-god (owing to the sage Durva\u015ba's charm). Hence he was not recognized as a P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dav, and was killed by the brothers. They call themselves 'Solar,' though having no connection with the regular S\u016brajb\u0101nsi clans.]\n\nIV. Agnikula.\n\n[See remarks in text: really this group forms part of the 'unknown' since no origin except the uncertain fire-legend, and some local traditions, can be quoted.]\n\nA. Parih\u0101ra, or Pratih\u0101ra (Padhi\u0101r of K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r?). There was a dynasty at Gwalior (A.D. 1129\u20131211) and some remains, as noted in the text. An inscription (Kielhorn's list, No. 39) mentions a family called 'Gurjara-pratih\u0101ra,' from Alwar.\n\nB. Pram\u0101ra (locally Pu\u0101r, or Pu\u00f1w\u0101r, West P.; along Sutlej and Indus; also colony in S.-East P.; rarely found in Rj.). Crookes writes Panw\u0101r (N., O., where there are over 96,000 of them). Bakr\u0101l, an alleged branch in R\u0101walpindi (?), Gheba, and Jodra (West P.) are clans; and so are the Tiw\u0101na (West P., Salt Range). Another branch is the Siy\u0101l (West P.)\u2014unless we accept Cunningham's report (from tribal annals) of a descent from 'R\u0101ja H\u016bdi,' in which case they are Indo-Scythian (Arch. Rep., ii, 22). But the Pram\u0101ra are very likely of \u015aak\u0101 affinity themselves.\nUjjayini, a clan (N., O.), descended from the Ujjain (Pram\u0101ra) sovereigns.\n\nC. \u010caluky\u0101, or \u010c\u0101lukya.\n   B\u0101ghela, or V\u0101ghela, W., N., O.\n   Solankhi, a branch in Gujar\u0101t, N., O.\n   Without doubt originating in the ultra-Vindhya region; possibly of \u0100ndhra connection.\n\nD. \u010cauh\u0101n (\u010c\u0101hum\u0101na of inscription).\n   In Rj. Early Ajmer possessions; ousted by the R\u0101thor. The septs found in Rj. are Deora (in Sirohi): the Khi\u010di or descendants of Raj\u0101 Pr. Chand in Nimr\u0101na (N.-West Rj.). All the following are also real or alleged clans:\n   Amethia (North O.). Their tradition prefers that one of the \u010cauh\u0101n origins which derives them from Vatsa (Jamadagnya Vatsa), and they call themselves \u2018Bhrigubansi\u2019 accordingly. But another account derives them from the \u010camar-gaur.\n   Bandh\u016bgoti (but another account connects them with the Ka\u010dhw\u0101ha of Jaipur).\n   Gondal (P., Salt Range).\n   H\u0101ra (of the chief domains H\u0101rauti, Bundi, and Kotah).\u00b9\n   Khi\u010di (West P., N., O.).\n\nSome authorities would make Nikumbh to belong to the \u010cauh\u0101n.\n\nV. UNKNOWN.\n\n1. Bargujar. Various accounts are given. Some (East P.) and some (N.), (Elliot, i, 38), claim Solar descent from Lava. Arose in Eastern R\u0101jput\u0101na. Very possibly connected with the ruling clans of Gurjara. As these were originally sun-worshippers, it is possible that a superior grade of them, becoming Hindus, adopted the usual expedient of inventing a descent from Lava.\n\n\u00b9 May not these be the H\u0101ra H\u016b\u1e47a of the fifth century?\n2. Barhulia (N., O.): Elliot, i, 57. Came from Marw\u0101r; said to be Bhriguba\u1e47si, but the account will not bear inspection; their chief ancestor was in service with a \u010ceru R\u0101j\u0101 and fighting the Bhar.\n\n3. Bisen (N., O.), said to be Bhriguba\u1e47si, from Para\u015bur\u0101ma (Crookes, ii, 116). Remnants of a half-Aryan stock not expelled from their country.\n\n4. Bundela, gave name to Bundelkha\u1e47\u1e0d (Elliot, i, 45). Probably a spurious offshoot of the G\u016bharw\u0101r or R\u0101thor.\n\n5. Candela (or Candella). A powerful tribe, but probably of mixed origin. An inscription of A.D. 953 (Ep. Ind., i, 123) calls the family Candellu, or Candrateya, with descent from a sage Candrateya, himself a descendant of Atri. (It is curious how many of these later traditions suggest the idea of a foreign warrior tribe becoming Brahmanic.) The (Khajur\u0101ho) inscription shows the family as of sufficient rank (in the tenth century) to marry into a \u010cauh\u0101n clan. Were Jaina at one time. Cunningham thinks they began at Mahoba (fifty-four miles south of Ham\u012brpur, N.W. Provinces) in the ninth century; afterwards ruled at K\u0101la\u1e45jara.

Now divided into the Bh\u0101\u1e6d-gaur, \u010cam\u0101r-gaur, and B\u0101hman-gaur, implying mixed races descendant from mothers of the Bh\u0101\u1e6d, \u010cam\u0101r, and Brahman castes or clans. Some of the Sutlej hill R\u0101j\u0101s (P.) of Suket, Mandi, etc., are \u2018Gaur.\u2019 An old chronicle states they preceded the \u010cauh\u0101n in \u0100jmer. A Gaur chief fought Sindhia at Sup\u0101ra, or Sop\u0101ra (Th\u0101na district of Bombay), as late as 1809. (This place was said to have been for centuries the capital\nof the Upper Konkan.) It is quite likely that the Bengal Rajas, of uncertain clan and called Gaur from the locality, were widely dispersed before the early Moslem conquests, and gave rise to a very miscellaneous series of clans.\n\n9. Gautam. A local tribe (N., O.), origin uncertain. Whether it is connected with Gautama Rishi or with the Saky\u0101 famous as the clan of Buddha, it is impossible to say. If it were so, on becoming Hindu it would not cherish any such reminiscence. I must refer to Crookes, ii, 404, for details: the sixth descendant of the Sage Gautama could not be contemporary with any G\u0101harw\u0101r or R\u0101\u1e6dhor prince of Kanauj.\n\n10.

This tribe is celebrated, as a number of princes held the throne of Delhi. All that can be said is that possibly they may have had some connection with an older royal Aryan stock, like the vaguely denominated Gaur Rajputs. I have made some further remarks in the text about a possible origin in Sirmur (north-west of the Jamna). We seem to have Tu\u0101r kings of both Kanauj and Delhi up to 1050 A.D., after which the R\u0101thor took Kanauj and confined the Tu\u0101r to Delhi. The succession passed, on failure of heirs, to the \u010cauh\u0101n.\n\nThe Tomara (and a section J\u0101tu) are still found in the East P., and in N. and O. there were 39,000 Tu\u0101rs (1891). The Jangh\u0101ra are a Tu\u0101r sept in Rohilkhand.\n\n24. V\u0101la (or B\u0101la). I may perhaps include this, as there is a chief still ruling at Dh\u0101nk (Gujarat).

XVI.\u2014A Theory of Universal Grammar, as applied to a Group of Savage Languages. By R. C. Temple.\n\nIn reviewing lately Mr. Portman's \"Notes on the Languages of the South Andaman Group of Tribes,\" I pointed out that he had used a pamphlet of my own, privately printed in 1883, entitled \"A Brief Exposition of a Theory of Universal Grammar,\" which was specially designed to meet the very difficulties he had to face in giving a general idea of languages constructed on lines at first sight very different from those on whose structure modern European Grammar is based.\n\nI also pointed out that the pamphlet in question arose out of the practical impossibility of using the usual inflexional system of Grammar, as taught in Europe for the accurate description of a group of agglutinative languages, and that it had its immediate origin in the criticisms of the late Mr. A. J. Ellis, public and private, on an old work of 1877 and certain MSS. by myself and Mr. E. H. Man on the Andamanese speech. Mr. Ellis explained that in order to adequately represent for scientific readers such a form of speech as the Andamanese, \"we require new terms and an entirely new set of grammatical conceptions, which shall not bend an agglutinative language to our inflexional translation,\" and he asked me accordingly if it were not possible \"to throw over the inflexional treatment of an uninflected language.\" This, and the further consideration that since every human being speaks with but the one object of communicating his own intelligence to other human beings, the several possible ways of doing this must be based on some general laws applicable to them all, if only one could find them out,\nI am to make the attempt to construct a general theory on logical principles, which should abandon the inflexional treatment, its exceptions, and its terms.\n\nSuch an attempt involved a wide departure from orthodox grammatical teaching, and I found that Mr. Portman, while adopting the change, had been unable to clear himself of the teaching in which he had been brought up, and had consequently produced a work which was a compromise between the two. His labours and praiseworthy efforts to adequately represent the aboriginal languages had failed in point of success, and my theory was not properly represented in his pages. I therefore promised in the future to return to the subject again in this Journal, and to give it under a more extended view of the theory than was then possible. Hence this article.\n\nWith these few introductory remarks I will proceed at once with my subject, commencing with a general statement of the supposition on which the theory is based, testing it by a method of study consisting of a savage group of words, and ending with a statement of the Andamanese language, which is the linguistic contents of an island in the Indian Ocean. The Andamanese language is made up of sixteen words, and consists of one or more words, which I defined as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions. It can also consist of one or more words, which I defined as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions. And when the subject or predicate contains principal\nThis leads to the argument that the components of a sentence are words, placed either in the subjective or predicative part of it, having a relation to each other in that part of principal and subordinate. Therefore, because of such relation, words fulfil functions. The functions of the principal words are to indicate the subject or predicate, and of the subordinate words to illustrate the predicate, or to explain the subject or to illustrate that explanation. Again, as the predicate is the discussion or communication on the subject, it is capable of extension or completion by complementary words, which form that part of a sentence recognized in the Grammars as 'the object.'\n\nThis completes the first stage of the argument leading to a direct and simple definition of grammatical terms; but speech obviously does not stop here, because mankind speaks with a purpose, and the function of his sentences is to indicate that purpose, which must be one of the following in any specified sentence:\u2014 (1) affirmation, (2) denial, (3) interrogation, (4) exhortation, (5) information.\n\nNow, purpose can be indicated in a sentence by the position of its components, by variation of their forms, or by the addition of special introductory words. Also, connected purposes can be indicated by connected sentences, placed in the relation to each other of principal and subordinate, which relation can be expressed by the position of the sentences themselves, by variation of the forms of their components, or by the addition of special words of reference. And a word of reference can act in two ways, either by merely joining sentences, or by substituting itself in the subordinate sentence for the word in the principal sentence to which it refers. Further, the inter-relation of the words in a sentence can be expressed by the addition of special connecting words, or by variation or correlated variation of form.\n\nThese considerations complete what may be called the second stage of the argument leading to clear definitions of grammatical terms. The argument thereafter becomes more complicated, taking us into the explanation of\nelliptical, i.e. incompletely expressed, forms of speech, and into those expansions of sentences known as phrases, clauses, and periods. But to keep our minds fixed for the present only on that part of it which leads to plain grammatical definitions, it may be stated now that functionally a word is either\u2014\n\n(1) An *integum*, or a sentence in itself.\n(2) An *indicativum*, or indicative of the subject or *complement* (object) of a sentence.\n(3) An *explanatorium*, or explanatory of its subject or complement.\n(4) A *predicativum*, or indicative of its predicate.\n(5) An *illustrativum*, or illustrative of its predicate or complement, or of the explanation of its subject or complement.\n(6) A *connector*, or explanatory of the inter-relation of its components (words).\n(7) An *introducer*, or explanatory of its purpose.\n(8) A *referent conjunctor*, or explanatory of the inter-relation of connected sentences by joining them.\n(9) A *referent substitute*, or explanatory of the inter-relation of connected sentences by substitution of itself in the subordinate sentence for the word in the principal sentence to which it refers.\n\nThese, then, are the terms I concocted and the arguments out of which they grew. Of course, grammarians will know that all this is syntax, and I will now explain why I consider that it is far more important to study function than form as essential to the correct apprehension of words, and how to my mind accidence arises properly out of syntax and not the other way round, as we have all been taught.\n\nIt is obvious that any given word may fulfil one or more or all the functions of words, and that therefore words may be collected into as many classes as there are functions, any individual word being transferable from one class to another and belonging to as many classes as there are functions which it can fulfil. The functions a word fulfils in any particular sentence can be indicated by its position therein\nwithout or with variation of form, and, because of this, the form which a word can be made to assume is capable of indicating the class to which it belongs for the nonce. It is further obvious that words transferable from class to class belong primarily to a certain class and secondarily to the others, that a transfer involves the fulfilment of a new function, and that a word in its transferred condition becomes a new word connected with the form fulfilling the primary function, the relation between the forms, i.e. the words, so connected being that of parent and offshoot. Form, therefore, can indicate the class to which a parent word and its offshoots respectively belong.\n\nThis is the induction that leads me to argue that form grows out of function, or, to put it in the familiar way, accidence grows out of syntax, because when connected words differ in form they must consist of a principal part or stem, and an additional part or functional affix. The function of the stem is to indicate the meaning of the word, and the function of the affix to modify that meaning with reference to the function of the word. This modification can be expressed by indicating the class to which the word belongs, or by indicating its relation or correlation to the other words in the sentence.\n\nBut the stem itself may consist of an original meaning and thus be a simple stem, or it may contain a modification of an original meaning and so be a compound stem. A compound stem must consist of a principal part or root and additional parts or radical affixes, the function of the root being to indicate the original meaning of the stem, and of the radical affixes to indicate the modifications by which the meaning of the root has been changed into the meaning of the stem.\n\nFurther, since words fulfil functions and belong to classes, they must possess inherent qualities, which can be indicated by qualitative affixes.\n\nThus it is that the affixes determine the forms of words, bringing into existence what is usually called etymology or derivation. They are attachable, separably or inseparably,\nto roots and stems and words by the well-recognized methods of prefixing, infixing, and suffixing, either in their full or in a varied form. It is the method of attaching them by variation of form that brings about inflexion in all its variety of kind.\n\nSuch is the line which I have long thought inductive argument should take, in order to work out the grammar of any given language or group of languages logically, starting from the base argument that speech is a mode of communication between man and man, expressed through the ear by talking, through the eye by signs, or through the skin by touch, and taking a language to be a variety or special mode of speech.\n\nThe grammar, i.e. the exposition of the laws, of any single language seems to me to stop at this point, and to carry the argument further, as one of course must, is to enter the region of Comparative Grammar. In doing so one must start at the same point as before, viz. the sentence, but progress on a different line, because hitherto the effort has been to resolve the unit of language into its components, and now it has to be considered as being itself a component of something greater, i.e. of a language.\n\nTo continue the argument. Since a sentence is composed of words placed in a particular order without or with variation of form, its meaning is clearly rendered complete by the combination of the meaning of its components with their position or forms or both. Also, since sentences are the units of languages, words are the components of sentences, and languages are varieties of speech, languages can vary in the forms of their words, or in the position in which their words are placed in the sentence, or in both. And thus are created classes of languages. Again, since the meaning of a sentence may be rendered complete either by the position of its words or by their forms, languages are primarily divisible into syntactical languages, or those that express complete meaning by the position of their words; and into formative languages, or those that express complete meaning by the forms of their words. Further, since words\nare varied in form by the addition of affixes, and since affixes may be attached to words in an altered or unaltered form, formative languages are divisible into agglutinative languages, or those that add affixes without alteration; and into synthetic languages, or those that add affixes with alteration. And lastly, since affixes may be prefixes, infixes, or suffixes, agglutinative and synthetic languages are each divisible into (1) pre-mutative, or those that prefix their affixes; (2) intro-mutative, or those that infix them; and (3) post-mutative, or those that suffix them.\n\nThus does it seem to me that the inductive argument can be carried onwards to a clear and definite apprehension of the birth and growth of the phenomena presented by the varieties of human speech, i.e. by languages. But as is the case with every other natural growth, no language can have ever been left to develop itself alone, and thus do we get the phenomenon of connected languages, which may be defined as those that differ from each other by varying the respective forms and positions, but not the meanings, of their words. And since the variation of form is effected by the addition of altered or unaltered affixes, connected languages can vary the forms of the affixes without materially varying those of the roots and stems of their words. In this way they become divisible into groups, or those whose stems are common, and into families, or those whose roots are common.\n\nIt is also against natural conditions for any language to develop only in one direction, or without subjection to outside influences, and so it is that we find languages developing on more than one line and belonging strictly to more than one class, but in every such case the language has what is commonly called its genius or peculiar constitution, i.e., it belongs primarily to one class and secondarily to the others.\n\nI have always thought, and I believe it could be proved, that every language must conform to some part or other of the theory above indicated in outline, and in that case the theory would be truly what I have ventured to call\nit\u2014\u201cA Theory of Universal Grammar.\u201d That such a theory exists in nature and only awaits unearthing, I have no doubt whatever. Mankind, when untrammelled by \u2018teaching,\u2019 acts on an instinctive assumption of its existence, for children and adults alike always learn a language in the same way if left to themselves. They copy the enunciation of complete sentences from experts in it to start with, learning to divide up and vary the sentences so acquired afterwards, and this is not only the surest but also the quickest way of mastering a foreign tongue correctly. Its rules of grammar, as stated in books about it, are mastered later on, and in every case where they only are studied there comes about that book knowledge of the language, which is everywhere by instinct acknowledged to be a matter apart from and inferior to the practical or true knowledge. I use the term \u2018true\u2019 here, because, unless this is possessed, whatever knowledge may be acquired fails to fulfil its object of finding a new mode of communicating with one\u2019s fellow man.\n\nBut it seems to me that if the laws laid down in the set Grammars were to follow closely on the laws instinctively obeyed by the untutored man, and to do no violence to what he feels to be the logical sequence of ideas, the divorce between practical and linguistic knowledge\u2014between knowledge by the ear and knowledge by the eye\u2014would not be so complete as it is nowadays. And not only that, if the laws could be stated in the manner above suggested, they could be more readily grasped and better retained in the memory, and languages would consequently be more quickly, more thoroughly, and more easily learned, both by children and adults, than is now practicable. Looked at thus, the matter becomes one of the greatest practical importance.\n\nThis is what I have attempted to achieve in stating my theory; but, assuming it to be fundamentally right and correctly worked out, it will be observed that it reverses the accepted order of teaching, alters many accepted definitions, and, while admitting much that is\nusually taught, it both adds and omits many details. Taken all round, it is a wide departure from orthodox teaching. Hence the interest that Mr. Portman's efforts possess for myself.\n\nBut, as I have already pointed out in my review of his book, he has not strictly applied the theory, and has mixed it up in his application with the accepted teaching. I will therefore now put it to the test in my own way, using for the purpose Mr. Portman's sixth chapter on \"The Andaman Fire Legend,\" which he gives in all the five languages of the South Andaman group.\n\nThe story is in each case a very short one, and is given by Mr. Portman as follows:\n\n**THE ANDAMAN FIRE LEGEND.**\n\n**Aka-Beada Language.**\n\n*Interlined Text.*\n\nTaul-l'oko-tima\u2014len Puluga\u2014la mami\u2014ka | Luratut\u2014la (a Place) \u2014 in God asleep\u2014was | (a Bird) chapa tap \u2014nga omo \u2014re | chapa\u2014la Puluga\u2014la fire steal\u2014ing bring\u2014did | fire God pugat \u2014ka | Puluga\u2014la boi \u2014ka | Puluga\u2014la chapa burning\u2014was | God awake\u2014was | God fire eni \u2014ka | a ik chapa\u2014lik Luratut seizing\u2014was | he taking fire \u2014by (Bird) l'ot\u2014pugari\u2014re | jek Luratut\u2014la eni \u2014ka | a burn \u2014t | at-once (Bird) taking\u2014was | he i\u2014Tar-cheker l'ot\u2014pugari\u2014re | Wota-Emi\u2014baraij \u2014len (a Bird) burn \u2014t | Wota-Emi\u2014village\u2014in Chaoga-tabanga oko\u2014dal\u2014re | Tomolola | The-ancestors made-fires | Tomolola |\n\n*Mr. Portman's Rendering.*\n\nGod was sleeping at Taul-l'oko-tima.

E.g., Kaulotat-ke is really an indicator (noun) with a predicative (verbal) suffix, and signifies some such expression as: 'Now, there was one Kaulotat.' In n'ote-tepuran we have the subject and predicate again combined into one expression\u2014n' (they) -ote-tepuran (became alive).\nThe next point for consideration, viz., that the components of the sentences are words, placed either in the subjective or predicative parts of it, having a relation to each other in that part, needs no special illustration, and one may pass on to the functions of the words, using the abbreviations given below in the illustrations exhibited. To make these clear to the reader, I will recapitulate the explanations given in the Theory.\n\nFunctionally a word is either\u2014\n\n(1) An integer, or a sentence in itself. *Int.* (Interjection, vocative, etc.)\n\n(2) An indicator, or indicative of the subject or complement (object) of a sentence. *In.* (Noun.)\n\n(3) An explicator, or explanatory of its subject or complement. *E.* (Adjective.)\n\n(4) A predicator, or indicative of its predicate. *P.* (Verb.)\n\n(5) An illustrator, or illustrative of its predicate or complement, or of the explanation of its subject or complement. *Ill.* (Adverb.)\n\n(6) A connector, or explanatory of the inter-relation of its components (words). *C.* (Conjunctions, pre- and post-positions, etc.)\n\n(7) An introducer, or explanatory of its purpose. *Ind.* (Conjunctions.)\n\n(8) A referent conjunctor, or explanatory of the inter-relation of connected sentences by joining them. *R.C.* (Relative adverbs, pronouns, etc.)\n\n(9) A referent substitute, or explanatory of the inter-relation of connected sentences by substitution of itself in the subordinate sentence for the word in the principal sentence to which it refers. *R.S.* (Pronouns.)\n\nBy 'complement' is meant the 'object,' and hence the indicators, explicators, and illustrators belonging to the 'objective' or complementary part of the sentence are marked as 'complementary indicators, etc.' thus: *C.Ind.*, *C.E.*, *C.Ill.*\nThe various sentences in the Legends can therefore be analyzed as follows:\n\n**AKA-BEADA.**\n\nTaull'okotimalen (Ill.)

In other words, they are all the outcome of the same habit of thought. It shows further, that that habit of thought is the simplest possible. Complications or extensions of ideas barely arise, and then only in the most direct form. E.g., Pukya-l'itoage-choapa (God-his-platform-fire, i.e. the fire from God's platform) and Ongot atyaukat monga, ongot oarotichal-enate Rokwa-l'artonga-baroija okodalnga-l'are (they fish becoming, they carrying-taking-by Rokwa-l'artonga-village-in fire-lighting-did, i.e. they became fish and taking (the fire) to the village of Rokwa-l'artonga lit a fire). The only signs of old habit or use in the languages are the frequent ellipses, indicating familiarity with them. The analysis also shows the languages to be purely colloquial, and therefore to have never been subjected to the modifications necessary when communication by signs, i.e. by writing, is resorted to. In short, the analysis seems to prove that the languages are the outcome of minds capable of but a very limited range of thought. Here, then, is one measure of the \"Universal Theory\" as a working hypothesis.\n\nLeaving the syntax here and passing on to the accidence according to the Theory, it will be best to state for the sake of brevity of exposition, that an analysis of the words composing the Andamanese sentences shows that all the languages are agglutinative; i.e., the words are formed by\nmeans of affixes to roots and stems without alteration of the radical forms of the affixes. It will also show that, like all other languages, they have not developed solely on one principle, and that rudiments of synthesis, or the attachment of affixes to roots and stems with alteration of form, are also present.\n\nAndamanese words are, therefore, as a rule, easily dismembered, and further examination will show that all the forms of affixes, i.e. prefixes, infixes, and suffixes, are present in them by agglutination. The use of the infixes is to modify the root or stem, and so they are what I have called radical affixes. The use of the prefixes is principally as radical affixes, but also to indicate the functions of the words or their relation to other words. They can, therefore, also be functional affixes. The use of the suffixes is likewise twofold: as functional affixes, or to indicate the inherent qualities of the words, i.e. to show which class they belong to. They are, therefore, either functional or qualitative affixes.\n\nWith this preliminary information let us set to work to analyze the words in the Legend, omitting proper names for the present, and premising that in the following analysis R. = Root, S. = Stem, P.F. = Functional prefix, P.R. = Radical prefix, I. = Infix, S.F. = Functional suffix, S.Q. = Qualitative suffix.\n\n**Aka-Beada.**\n\n(1) Mami (R.)\u2014ka (S.Q.).

No introductory words to sentences are used at all; only one conjunction between words and only two between sentences, referring in each case to what has been already said. There are no forward references, and there is only one referent substitute (pronoun, in this case of the 3rd person). In telling the Legend, we therefore see that, to employ the old familiar phraseology, the Aka-Beada use two nouns, eight verbs, one ref. conj., and one pronoun. The Akar-Bale use five nouns, nine verbs, one adv., one conj., one pron. in two forms. The Puchikwar use one noun (fire), six verbs, one adv., one ref. conj. in two forms, one pron. The Aukau-Juwai use two nouns, three verbs, one adj., one pron. The Kol use three nouns, seven verbs, one adv., one pron. Poverty of thought and idea could hardly go lower than this. We are really brought face to face with the speech of undeveloped savages.\n\nThe evidence is as follows:\n\n**Tables of Roots and Stems.**\n\n**Indicators (Nouns).**\n\n| English | Aka-Beada | Akar-Bale | Puchikwar | Aukau-Juwai | Kol |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|-----|\n| village | baraij    | baroij    | toago      | pauroich    |     |\n| platform|           |           |            |             |     |\n| all-men | paura     |           |            |             |     |\n| fire    | chapa     | choapa    | at         | at          | at  |\n| fish    |           |           | yaukat     |             |     |\n| wood    |           |           | peakar     |             | pin |\n| charcoal|           |           |            |             |     |\n\n**Predicators (Verbs).**\n\n| Seize   | eni       | ena       | di, li     | kek         |\n| Take    | ik        | ik        |            |             |\n| Light-a-fire | dal | kadak    | kodak     | kaudak     |\n| Do      |           |           | pat       | ema         | pat |\n| Sleep   | mami      |           |           |             |     |\n| Steal   | tap       |           |           | top         |     |\n| Bring   | omo       | omo       | lechi     |             |     |\nThe proof can be seen by an examination of Mr. Portman's Comparative Vocabulary and his most patient analysis of the words therein.\n\n### Tables of Affixes.\n\n#### Prefixes, functional.\n\n| English | Aka-Beada | Akar-Bale | Puchikwar | Aukau-Juwai | Kol. |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|\n| his, its | l'-'      | l'-'      | l'-'      | l'-'        | l'-' |\n| (?) his  | k'-'      | k'-'      |           |             |      |\n| theirs   | n'-'      | n'-'      |           |             |      |\n\n#### Prefixes, radical.\n\n| (P) | ot- | oto- | atak- | otam-, ote- |\n|-----|-----|-----|-------|------------|\n| (P) | at- | at- |       |            |\n| (P) | oko-| oko-| aukau- | oko-        |\n|     | ab- | o-  | auko-  |            |\n| (P) | ar- | i-  | ir-, irim- |\n| (P) | i-  | on- |        |            |\n\n#### Suffixes, functional.\n\n| by    | -lik | -te | -ke | -lak |\n|-------|------|-----|-----|------|\n| in    | -len | -a  | -in,-an | -en |\n| with  |      |     | -lo |      |\n| to    | -len | -lin| -kete|\n| at    |      |     | -t  |      |\n\n#### Suffixes, qualitative.\n\n| was   | -ka  | -kate,-ia | -chike | -ke |\n|-------|------|-----------|--------|----|\n| -ing  | -nga | -nga      | -nga   |    |\n| did   | -re  | -t,-te    | -ye,-an|-t   |\n| (honorific) | -la,-ola | -le | -la | -la |\n\nThe reader will by this time have perceived that the development of the fundamental meanings of the roots and stems of Andamanese words is effected by means of radical prefixes; a consideration that brings us in contact\nThe classification is stated by him thus:\n\nThe roots appear to be divided into\n\nnames of parts of the body, with special refe\n\nRoots referring to the human\n\nNames of other natural animate and inanimate ob\n\nRoots which are capable of being converted\n\nPredicators, as well as being Indic\n\nConjunctions, Exclamati\n\nNames of animals, men and women, the Fl\n\nGreek Female Names,\n\nIn the above statement, the\n\nto indicate the g\n\nprimarily or second\n\nin some of their\n\na group I we find\n\nare samples:\nAs might be expected of savages, the Andamanese are intensely anthropomorphic, and this fact comes out in their languages, the radical prefixes in form and origin revolving for all Groups chiefly round those used to differentiate the parts of the human body or human attributes and necessities. There are, however, radical prefixes, whose function is purely to modify the meaning of a root, and so to form, in combination with the root, a pure stem. Here are instances out of Mr. Portman's book:\n\n*Yop(-da)* is, in Aka-Bead\u00e0, 'soft' or 'pliable'; then, a sponge is *ot-yop*, soft; a cane is *auto-yop*, pliable; a pencil is *aka-yop* or *auko-yop*, pointed; the human body is *ab-yop*, soft; certain parts of it are *ong-yop*, soft; fallen trees are *ar-yop*, rotten; an adze is *ig-yop*, blunt.\n\n*Chaurog(-nga)* means in Aka-Bead\u00e0 generally 'tie(ing) up.' Unmodified by a radical prefix it refers to the tying up of bundles of firewood or plantains, whence *chaurog-nga(-da)*, a faggot. But when so modified it can mean as follows: *aut-chaurog-nga*, tying up the carcases of dead pigs so that they may be carried on the back; *aka-chaurog-nga*, tying up jack-fruit into bundles; *ar-chaurog-nga*, tying up birds; *ong-chaurog-nga*, tying together the feet of little pigs while alive to prevent escape.\n\nThe anthropomorphism of the Andamanese, already noticed, induces them to refer all words, capable of such reference, directly to themselves, by means of referent prefixes to stems composed of roots plus radical prefixes; thus:\n\n**The Head.**\n\n| English | Aka-Bead\u00e0 | Akar-Bale | Puchikwar | Aukau-Juwoi | Kol. |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|\n| head    | -cheta    | -chekta   | -ta       | -tau        | -toi |\n| his-d\u00b0  | ot-       | aut-      | ote-      | auto-       | aute-|\n| my-d\u00b0   | d'ot-     | d'aut-    | t'o'te-   | t'auto-     | t'aute-|\n\n**The Hand.**\n\n| hand    | -kauro    | -kauro    | -kaure    | -korau      | -kaure |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| his-d\u00b0  | on-       | ong-      | ong-      | aun-        | aun-   |\n| thy-d\u00b0  | ng'on-    | ng'ong-   | ng'ong-   | ng'aun      | ng'aun-|\nIn the above cases, to the roots for 'head' and 'hand' are added for 'his' the root-forms of the prefixes, to which for 'my' and 'thy' have been superadded abbreviated forms of the root-forms for 'I' and 'thou.' And so it is for all the 'persons.'\n\nAlso when the reference is possible to \"persons in the plural,\" some, but not by any means all, the Andamanese emphasize the fact of such reference by modifying the form of the radical prefix to indicate it, thus:\n\n| Aka-Beda | Akar-Bale |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Sing.    | Plu.      | Sing.    | Plu.      |\n| ot       | otot      | aut      | autot     |\n| ong      | oiot      | aung     | aungtot   |\n| aka      | akat      | akar     | akat      |\n| ab       | at        | ap       | at        |\n| ig       | itig      | id       | idit      |\n| ar       | arat      | ar       | arat      |\n\nNo such alterations take place in Puchikwar and Aukau-Juwoi, except to differentiate 'thy' from 'your.' Thus: in Puchikwar, aute, sing., is autel, plu.; and in Aukau-Juwoi autau, sing., is autel, plu.; and so on.\n\nTo the differentiating plu. radical prefixes are added, where necessary, functional prefixes, thus:\n\n| English | Aka-Beda | Akar-Bale | Puchikwar | Aukau-Juwoi |\n|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n| our     | m'otot   | m'autot   | m'aute    | m'autau     |\n| your    | ng'otot  | ng'autot  | ng'autel  | ng'autel    |\n\nAnother noteworthy fact, again due to anthropomorphism, is that usually the Andamanese languages conceive every word, when possible, as referred to 'the 3rd person,' e.g., ot-cheta-da is strictly not 'head,' but 'his head.' So otot-cheta-da is strictly 'their heads.' And so, in order to express a clear reference to a '3rd person,' where the context renders such necessary, they do so by means of a referent prefix evolved for the purpose, thus:\n\n| English | Aka-Beda | Akar-Bale | Puchikwar | Aukau-Juwoi | Kol. |\n|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------|\n| Sing.   | Plu.     | Sing.     | Plu.      | Sing.       | Plu. |\n| '-e, its | l'-l'-l'-l'-len'-l'-len'-l'-len'-his (their) |\nThe last three forms seem to explain the origin of this curious habit, for in them we find a special referent prefix for 'their,' and so, when it is necessary to make 'their' clearly referent, we find a second prefix le superadded. We can therefore also say that the referent prefix l- seems to indicate one of the signs of 'growth' in the languages, as we now have them.\n\nLastly, when the natural conditions require that an Andamanese should throw into a single expression more than one idea, he does so by direct and simple combination, with the aid of his referent prefix for 'its,' as may be seen from the proper names and some of the compound words in the texts of the Legend. Thus: Taul-l'-ckotima, Taul-tree-its-corner, i.e. (the village at) the corner (among) the Taul-trees; Keri-l'-ongtauwer, Keri-tree-its-sand, i.e. (the village on) the sand (among) the Keri-trees.\n\nSo here, again, it appears to me that the languages, even in the complicated forms and usage of the prefixes, show themselves to be purely and directly the expression of 'savage' thought, affording yet another measure of the Theory as a working hypothesis.\n\nNow, of course, the Andamanese go far beyond this skeleton in the details of their speech, but everything else to be found in it seems to me to be a development of these fundamental laws, arising out of a mere following up to a further expansion the ideas contained in them, or out of the necessities of speech itself. There are no more further 'principles' to explain, so far as I can at present see, and I would refer the reader to Mr. Portman's careful and laborious pages for a proof of the present assertions. I would also take leave to refer him to those pages and to the foregoing observations, should he desire to judge for himself how far the Theory may be called a successful attempt to meet the conditions.\n\nI will now proceed to state the Theory in skeleton form, believing that its bones can be clothed with the necessary flesh for every possible language by the process of direct natural development of detail,\u2014that a clear and fair\nexplanation of all the phenomena of speech can be logically deduced from the general principles enunciated therein.\n\nIt seems to me to be necessary to say very little at present by way of preface. The Theory is based on the one phenomenon, which must of necessity be constant in every variety of speech, viz. the expression of a complete meaning, or, technically, the sentence. Words are then considered as components of the sentence, firstly as to the functions performed by them, and next as to the means whereby they can be made to fulfil their functions. Lastly, languages are considered according to their methods of composing sentences and words. This course of reasoning commends itself to my mind as logically correct, and if it be so, must, when properly worked out, explain every phenomenon of speech.\n\nTerminology is a matter of convenience, and I have in the exposition of the Theory, changed the familiar terminology of the Grammars of the orthodox sort merely as a convenience. The question presents itself to me as one of choosing between the devising of new terms and the giving of new definitions to well-known old ones, used habitually in other senses. To my own mind it is easier to apprehend and retain in the memory the meaning of a new word than to keep before the mind a new definition of an old and familiar one. Hence my choice. But this is so much a personal matter, that it is a question of indifference to which method is adopted.\n\nThe familiar terminology has accordingly been changed in this wise. The old noun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, and conjunction become indicator, expicator, predicative, illustrative, connector, and referent conjunctive, while determiners and pronouns become integers and relative substitutes. Certain classes also of the adverbs are converted into introducers. Gender, number, person, tense, conjugation, and declension all disappear in the universal dispensation of kinds of inflexion\u2014the object becomes the complement of the predicate, and concord becomes translated variation. Also for obvious reasons subjects,\nnecessarily occupying an important place in Grammars which aim at explaining all that there is to say about a language\u2014such as its phonology, orthography, and elocution\u2014are not now considered in the exposition of the Theory.\n\nTHE SKELETON\n\nor\n\nA THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR.\n\nSpeech is a mode of communication between man and man by expression. Speech may be communicated orally through the ear by talking, optically through the eye by signs, tangibly through the skin by the touch. Languages are varieties of speech.\n\nThe units of languages are sentences. A sentence is the expression of a complete meaning.\n\nA sentence may consist of a single expression of a meaning. A single expression of a meaning is a word. A sentence may also consist of many words. When it consists of more than one word, it has two parts. These parts are the subject and the predicate. The subject of a sentence is the matter communicated or discussed in the sentence. The predicate of a sentence is the communication or discussion of that matter in the sentence.\n\nThe subject may consist of one word. It may also consist of many words. When it consists of more than one word, there is a principal word and additional words. The predicate may consist of one word. It may also consist of many words. When it consists of more than one word, there is a principal word and additional words. Therefore the components of a sentence are words placed either in\nthe subjective or predicative part of it, having a relation to each other in that part. This relation is that of principal and subordinate.\n\nSince the words composing the parts of a sentence are placed in a position of relation to each other, they fulfil functions. The function of the principal word of the subject is to indicate the matter communicated or discussed by expressing it. The function of the subordinate words of the subject may be to explain that indication, or to illustrate the explanation of it. The function of the principal word of the predicate is to indicate the communication, or discussion of the subject by expressing it. The function of the subordinate words of the predicate may be to illustrate that indication, or to complete it. The predicate may be completed by a word explanatory of the subject or indicative of the complement. Therefore, primarily, the words composing a sentence are either\u2014\n\n(1) Indicators, or indicative of the subject.\n(2) Explicators, or explanatory of the subject.\n(3) Predicators, or indicative of the predicate.\n(4) Illustrators, or illustrative of the predicate, or of the explanation of the subject.\n(5) Complements, or complementary of the predicate.\n\nAnd complements are either indicators or explicators. Therefore also complementary indicators may be explained by explicators, and this explanation may be illustrated by illustrators. And complementary explicators may be illustrated by illustrators.\n\nBut, since speech is a mode of communication between man and man, mankind speaks with a purpose. The function of sentences is to indicate the purpose of speech. The purpose of speech is either (1) affirmation, (2) denial, (3) interrogation, (4) exhortation, or (5) information. Purpose may be indicated in a sentence by the position of its components, by variation of the forms of its components, or by the addition of introductory words to express it or introducers.\nAlso, since the function of sentences is to indicate the purpose of speech, connected purposes may be indicated by connected sentences. The relation of connected sentences to each other is that of principal and subordinate. This relation may be expressed by the position of the connected sentences, by variation of the forms of their components, or by the addition of referent words expressing it or referents. A referent word may express the inter-relation of connected sentences by conjoining them, or by substituting itself in the subordinate sentence for the word in the principal sentence to which it refers. Referents are therefore conjunctors or substitutes.\n\nAlso, since the words composing the parts of a sentence are placed in a position of relation to each other, this relation may be expressed in the sentence by the addition of connecting words expressing it or connectors, or by variation of the forms of the words themselves.\n\nAlso, since predicators are especially connected with indicators; explicators with indicators; illustrators and complements with predicators; and referent substitutes with their principals; there is an intimate relation between predicator and indicator, indicator and explicator, illustrator and predicator, predicator and complement, referent substitute and principal. This intimate relation may be expressed by the addition of connecting words to express it, or by correlated variation in the forms of the especially connected words.\n\nSince speech is a mode of communication between man and man by expression, that communication may be made complete without complete expression. Speech may, therefore, be partly expressed, or be partly left unexpressed. And since speech may be partly left unexpressed, referent words may refer to the unexpressed portions, and words may be related to unexpressed words or correlated to them. Referent substitutes may, therefore, indicate the subject of a sentence.\nAgain, many words may be used collectively to express the meaning of one word. The collective expression of a single meaning by two or more words is a phrase. The relation of a phrase to the word it represents is that of original and substitute. A phrase, therefore, fulfills the function of its original.\n\nSince a phrase is composed of words used collectively to represent a single expression of a meaning, that meaning may be complete in itself. Therefore a phrase may be a sentence. A sentence substituted for a word is a clause. A clause, therefore, fulfills the function of its original.\n\nSince clauses represent words, a sentence may be composed of clauses, or partly of clauses and partly of words. A sentence composed of clauses, or partly of clauses and partly of words, is a period.\n\nTherefore a word is functionally either\u2014\n\n1. A sentence in itself or an integer,\n2. An essential component of a sentence, or\n3. An optional component of a sentence.\n\nThe essential components of a sentence are (1) indicators, (2) explicators, (3) predicators, (4) illustrators, (5) complements. And complements are either indicators or explicators.\n\nThe optional components of a sentence are (1) introducers, (2) referents, (3) connectors. And referents are either referent conjunctors or referent substitutes.\n\nTo recapitulate: Functionally a word is either\u2014\n\n1. An integer, or a sentence in itself.\n2. An indicator, or indicative of the subject or complement of a sentence.\n3. An expicator, or explanatory of its subject or complement.\n4. A predicator, or indicative of its predicate.\n(5) An **illustrator**, or illustrative of its predicate or complement, or of the explanation of its subject or complement.\n\n(6) A **connector**, or explanatory of the inter-relation of its components.\n\n(7) An **introducer**, or explanatory of its purpose.\n\n(8) A **referent conjunctor**, or explanatory of the inter-relation of connected sentences by joining them.\n\n(9) A **referent substitute**, or explanatory of the inter-relation of connected sentences by substitution of itself in the subordinate sentence for the word in the principal sentence to which it refers.\n\nAn individual word may fulfil all the functions of words, or it may fulfil only one function, or it may fulfil many functions. When a word can fulfil more than one function, the function it fulfils in a particular sentence is indicated by its position in the sentence, either without variation of form or with variation of form. There are, therefore, **classes of words**.\n\nSince a word may fulfil only one function, there are as many classes as there are functions. Also, since a word may fulfil more than one function, it may belong to as many classes as there are functions which it can fulfil. A word may, therefore, be transferable from one class to another; and this transfer may be effected by its position in the sentence without variation of form, or with variation of form. The class to which a word belongs may, therefore, be indicated by its **form**.\n\nWhen a word is transferable from one class to another, it belongs primarily to a certain class, and secondarily to other classes. But, since by transfer to another class from the class to which it primarily belongs (with or without variation of form) the word fulfils a new function, it becomes a **new word** connected with the original word. The relation\nbetween connected words is that of parent and offshoot. Since the form of a word may indicate its class, both parent and offshoot may assume the forms of the classes to which they respectively belong.\n\nWhen connected words differ in form, they consist of a principal part or stem, and an additional part or functional affix. The function of the stem is to indicate the meaning of the word. The function of the functional affix is to modify that meaning with reference to the function of the word. This modification may be effected by indicating the class to which the word belongs, or by indicating its relation or correlation to the other words in the sentence.\n\nA stem may be an original meaning or simple stem, or it may be a modification of an original meaning or compound stem. A compound stem consists of a principal part or root, and additional parts or radical affixes. The function of the root is to indicate the original meaning of the stem. The function of the radical affixes is to indicate the modifications by which the meaning of the root has been changed into the meaning of the stem.\n\nSince words fulfil functions and belong to classes, they possess inherent qualities. The inherent qualities of words may be indicated by qualitative affixes.\n\nAffixes are, therefore, functional, or indicative of the function of the word to which they are affixed, or of its relation or correlation to the other words in the sentence; radical, or indicative of the modifications of meaning which its root has undergone; qualitative, or indicative of its inherent qualities.\n\nAffixes may be\u2014\n\n(1) prefixes, or prefixed to the root, stem, or word;\n(2) infixes, or fixed into the root, stem, or word;\n(3) suffixes, or suffixed to the root, stem, or word.\nAffixes may be attached to roots, stems, or words in their full form, or in a varied form. When there is variation of form, there is inflexion or inseparability of the affix from the root, stem, or word. All the functions of affixes can, therefore, be fulfilled by inflexion; and inflected words may conform to particular kinds of inflexion.\n\nSince a sentence is composed of words placed in a particular order, with or without variation of form, the meaning of a sentence is rendered complete by the combination of the meaning of its components with their position, or with their forms, or partly with their position and partly with their forms.\n\nSince sentences are the units of languages, and words are the components of sentences, and since languages are varieties of speech, languages may vary in the forms of their words, or in the position in which their words are placed in the sentence, or partly in the forms and partly in the position of their words. There are, therefore, classes of languages.\n\nSince the meaning of a sentence may be rendered complete either by the position of its words or by their form, languages are primarily divisible into syntactical languages, or those that express complete meaning by the position of their words; and into formative languages, or those that express complete meaning by the forms of their words.\n\nSince words are varied in form by the addition of affixes, and since affixes may be attached to words in an unaltered or altered form, formative languages are divisible into agglutinative languages, or those that add affixes without alteration; and into synthetic languages, or those that add affixes with alteration.\n\nSince affixes may be prefixes, infixes, or suffixes, agglutinative and synthetic languages are each divisible into (1) pre-mutative languages, or those that prefix their\naffixes; (2) intro-mutative languages, or those that infix their affixes; (3) post-mutative languages, or those that suffix their affixes.\n\nLanguages are, therefore, by class either syntactical or formative. And formative languages are either agglutinative or synthetic. And agglutinative and synthetic languages are either pre-mutative, intro-mutative, or post-mutative.\n\nA language may belong entirely to one class, or it may belong to more than one class. When a language belongs to more than one class, it belongs primarily to a particular class, and secondarily to other classes.\n\nSince the meaning of a sentence is rendered complete by the meaning of its words in combination with their forms or position, languages may be connected languages, or those that vary the forms or the position, without varying the meanings, of their words.\n\nSince variation of form is effected by the addition of affixes in an unaltered or altered form, connected languages may vary the affixes without variation of the roots or stems of their words. Connected languages whose stems are common belong to a group. Connected languages whose roots are common belong to a family; and, therefore, all connected languages belonging to a group belong to the same family.\nART. XVII.\u2014Notes on Zarathu\u0161tra's Doctrine regarding the Soul. By E. W. West.\n\nOn reference to the Millennial Chronology of the Bundahis (as corrected and extended in S.B.E., vol. xlvii, Introduction, \u00a7 55) it will be seen that the first millennium commenced in B.C. 9630 with the formation of the Fravashis, or primary ideas of the good creations, which remained insensible and motionless for 3,000 years. At the beginning of the fourth millennium (B.C. 6630) the spiritual body of Zarathu\u0161tra was framed together and remained 3,000 years with the Ame\u0161aspentas, while the primeval man and ox existed undisturbed in the world, because the Maleficent spirit was still confounded and powerless. But, at the beginning of the seventh millennium (B.C. 3630) the Maleficent spirit rushed into the creation, destroyed the Primeval ox, and distressed Gayomart, the primeval man, who died thirty years later; but Zarathu\u0161tra was not born till B.C. 660.\n\nDescriptive of these evils we have the second H\u0101, or chapter, of the first G\u0101tha (Yasna, xxix), in which the Geu\u0161-urvan, or Soul of the Primeval Ox, bewails the hard fate of cattle in general, owing to drovers, robbers, and brutes who lacerate and plunder; he begs the protection of the Ame\u0161aspentas, and an assurance of good pasture for the animals he represents.\n\nThe creator of the Primeval Ox, Ahura-mazda himself, asks Asha ('righteousness') whom it is that he has appointed to control the masters of cattle, and what benevolent ruler to prevent violence. Asha replies that the bad masters do not yet understand the future recompense they will themselves receive for kindness to their cattle, nor the future punishment they will suffer for cruel\ntreatment. And Vohuman\u014d ('good-thought') adds that he has found a man, in Zarathu\u0161tra the Spit\u0101ma, who will listen to their instructions and teach mankind accordingly.\n\nAs in this case we find the term soul applied to the representative spirit of the Primeval Ox, so in other cases we shall find the representative and responsible spirit of a human being is the soul. The fravashi, or guardian-spirit, is a totally distinct spiritual adjunct which every individual and object of the good creation possesses; it is a kind of primary idea, and is the spiritual counterpart of a deceased person, that is invoked, or reverenced, in certain ceremonies. Its duty is to protect the body which it represents.\n\nIn the G\u0101thas the following passages occur, regarding the soul and its responsibilities, and are here explained according to Darmesteter's translations:\n\nYasna, xxviii, 4. I who give Paradise to the soul, with the help of Vohuman\u014d.\n\nxxxi, 20. To him who shall have wished to deceive the righteous, there come groanings hereafter, long dwelling in darkness, unwholesome food, and words of insult. Such is the world, you wicked! to which your works and religion lead.\n\nxxxii, 9. Ahura-mazda occasions happiness, along with Vohuman\u014d; they do the work together perfectly, their souls being in unison.\n\nxxxiv, 2. These are the works of the man of benevolence, whose soul has righteousness for companion.\n\nxlv, 8. And how my soul will be able to go and find joy in both worlds.\n\nxlv, 7. The soul of the righteous aspires to immortality and strength, whilst the wicked will be in torment.\n\nxlv, 10. For all those whom I shall induce to address their prayer to you, a way over the Cinvat bridge will disclose itself.\n\nxlv, 11. The Karapans and Kavis are united in power to destroy the world of mortals by their evil deeds. But their soul and their conscience will groan when they arrive\nbefore the Cinvat bridge, to reside for ever in the abode of the fiend.\n\nxlix, 11. As to the wicked and the bad princes, of evil deeds, evil words, evil religion, and evil thoughts, their souls go to receive impure nourishment; truly they shall go to inhabit the abode of the fiend.\n\nli, 9. With the knowledge which thou givest, among adversaries in conflict, by means of thy red fire, O Mazda! with the sign thou givest in both worlds, by means of melted metal, thou afflictest the wicked and causest the happiness of the righteous.\n\nli, 13. Both the wicked and the righteous render an exact account of their religion; the former soul will groan before the Cinvat bridge, because he has destroyed the path of the good by his actions and his tongue. 14. From the Karapans there is no generous friendship, nor any goodness of action; they do not teach the good treatment of herds, either in their practice or in their doctrine; and their doctrine will give them, in the end, the abode of the fiend for a dwelling. 15. But the recompense, that Zarathu\u015btra has promised to the pure, is the supreme heaven (gar\u014d-dem\u0101na) where Ahura-mazda first came.\n\nThe state of society described in the G\u0101thas is of a primitive character. Apparently scattered settlements of cattle-owners and agriculturists, under local chieftains, all subject to some central control, but the people not nomadic. The G\u0101thic period was evidently a time of religious revolution; the old priesthood, whether Karapans or Kavis, are always classed as evildoers and reprobates, trying to injure the reformed faith in Ahura-mazda and his attributes, the Ame\u0161aspantas; but the exact differences between the rival faiths and practices are by no means clearly explained. One man is wicked and the other righteous; one is demoniacal and the other divine; one merits hell until the resurrection and the other deserves eternity in heaven; but, except that the wicked man is disobedient, and the righteous man is obedient, to the\nreformer, the reasons given for treating them differently are not always quite satisfactory, especially as the wicked are not said to be da\u0113vayasna, 'demon-worshipping,' the usual epithet for polytheists, or heathens, in the later Yasna and Vend\u012bd\u0101.\n\nRegarding the fate of the soul shortly after death we have also two H\u0101s, or chapters, both Avesta and Pahlavi, which are reported to be fragments of the Hadhaokhta Nask, but cannot be traced in the Pahlavi account of that Nask given in Dinakard, viii, xlv, 1\u201315 (S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. 166\u2013169). These H\u0101s were published by Hoshangji and Haug, along with the Book of Art\u0101-Viraf (pp. 309\u2013316).\n\nThey state that the soul remains near the head of the corpse for the first three nights after death. If it be righteous it sits calmly reciting the beginning of Yasna xliii, and feels as much pleasure as ever it did before death. If it be wicked it rushes about, reciting in despair the beginning of Yasna xlvi, and suffers as much misery as ever it had experienced during life.\n\nAt the end of the third night the righteous soul advances, through a grove of trees, with a sweet-scented breeze blowing on him from the south, and presently meets a beautiful maiden, who tells him that she is his own good religion and actions, in fact, his clear conscience; and he himself feels that he has become youthful. He then steps forth on to the heaven of good thoughts, then upon that of good words, then upon that of good actions, and finally upon the eternal luminaries, where a soul previously arrived asks him how he has come. But Ahuramazda reproves the inquisitive soul for troubling him with questions after so hazardous a journey, and the righteous soul is supplied with nutritious food.\n\nAt the end of the third night, the wicked soul advances through terrors and stenches, with a foul-smelling wind blowing upon him from the north, and presently meets his conscience in the shape of a hideous hag who upbraids him on account of his wickedness. Then, stepping on to the hells of evil thought, evil speech, and evil action,\nwith the fourth step he rushes into the nethermost hell, where he is jeered at by a previous arrival, who is reproved by the Maleficent spirit, and the wicked soul is supplied with impure and poisonous food.\n\nThe Cinvat bridge, easy for the righteous, but impassable by the wicked, is mentioned several times in the G\u0101thas, and also occurs in Vend\u012bd\u0101d xix and the later Yasna, but is not noticed in these H\u0101s of the Hadhaokhta Nask. The female representative of the good conscience also appears in Vend\u012bd\u0101d, xix, 30, accompanied by dogs, to assist the righteous soul over the bridge; while the wicked soul is left to be dragged to hell by the demon Vizaresa.\n\nAccording to the Pahlavi accounts, in Mainy\u014d-i Khirad, ii, 114\u2013194, and Art\u0101-Viraf n\u0101mak, iv, 6\u2013v, 5; xvii, 2\u201327, the soul is assisted by the yazatas Mithra, Srao\u0161a, and others, and the balance of its good works and sins being ascertained and settled by Rashnu, it is conducted either to heaven by the yazatas, or to hell by the demons, according to its deserts. But the Yashts of the particular yazatas do not seem to allude to these circumstances; although the ceremonies prescribed for the days following a death evidently assume the spiritual presence of these yazatas.\n\nBut, besides the righteous and the wicked, there is a third class of soul provided for; that whose good works very nearly balance its evil deeds. This kind of soul is kept in an inert state, till the resurrection, in the open space between the earth and the fixed stars; the place of the Ham\u0113stagan, the \u201cever-stationary, or those staying together,\u201d where they suffer only from the daily variations of heat and cold (see Mainy\u014d-i Khirad, vii, 18). This species of purgatory for a fixed period is evidently mentioned in the G\u0101thas (Yasna, xxxiii, 1) as follows:\u2014\u201cAs they are scrutinized, so one shall practise the laws which are of the primitive world; the justest actions of the priestly authority are for the wicked, as well as for the righteous, and for him in whom something of the false, as well as what are truths, alike prevails (?).\u201d\nThe Avesta verb *h\u00e9my\u00e1sait\u0113*, which I have doubtfully translated by 'alike prevails,' is probably the word from which the various Pahlavi forms of the name of this purgatory are derived, such as *Ham\u0113stak\u0101n*, *Ham\u0113st\u0101n*, *Ham\u0113st\u0101nik*, *Ham\u0113st\u0101ng\u0101n*, *Ham-hastak\u0101n*, *Ham-hast\u0101nik*, and *Hamast\u0101n*. So the Pahlavi notion of 'immobility' should probably be modified, either into 'crowding together' or 'equal propensity for good and evil.'\n\nSo far, the Parsi is more certain of the immediate fate of the soul than people of most other religions; but there is still the future ordeal of the resurrection to pass through. As the chief object of this is to destroy evil, the righteous soul is little affected by the ordeal, which also concludes the torments of the wicked soul, unless it has been exceptionally wicked, in which case it has to endure three nights more of extreme torment before it is purified. Then each soul is sent to that particular grade of heaven to which its actions entitle it. The demons are destroyed by the good spirits, the space occupied by hell is annexed to the earth, and both are freed from mountains and ice, and remain imperishable for ever and ever. This is told in *Indian Bundahi\u0161*, xxx, which is practically the same as xlii of the Iranian version; and Darmesteter, in his *Zend-avesta*, ii, p. 640, n. 138, gives a French translation of some further details from the Pahlavi *Marvels of the month Fravardin* and day *Khurdat*.\n\nWestergaard's Avesta *Fragment iv* is the original text of the last fargard of the Var\u0161tm\u0101nsar Nask, as Darmesteter first discovered from my translation of the Pahlavi version in S.B.E., xxxvii, pp. 302\u20133. It contains a distinct allusion to the resurrection, and to the Airyaman supplication being used as a spell by Saosy\u0101ns, the last of the future apostles, to overcome the evil spirits, who are driven by it underground, where their bodies are completely shattered. So there can be no doubt that the resurrection was expected in Avesta times, and Darmesteter himself admits that it was a belief of the Achaemenians.\n\nAs Zarathu\u015btra is supposed to have been born thirty years\nbefore the commencement of his millennium, so each of the three succeeding apostles, Ukhshya\u1e6d-ereta, Ukhshya\u1e6d-nemanh, and Sao\u0161y\u0101ns, is supposed to be born thirty years before the commencement of each of the three succeeding millenniums, so as to assume priestly control at the vigorous age of thirty, when his millennium begins. According to the rectified Millennial Chronology of the Bundahi\u0161, before mentioned (p. 605), the millennium of Zarathu\u0161tra began B.C. 630; that of Ukhshya\u1e6d-ereta in A.D. 371; that of Ukhshya\u1e6d-nemanh in A.D. 1371; that of Sao\u0161y\u0101ns ought to begin in A.D. 2371; and the resurrection, at the end of his fifty-seventh year, may be expected in A.D. 2398. But, owing to the errors that have crept into the Bundahi\u0161 chronology, the Parsis themselves are quite uncertain about these dates. What they know of their religious history after the Mu\u1e25ammadan conquest of Persia, and what they expected for the future, in A.D. 900, may be learned from Dinkard, VII, cha. viii\u2013xi, in S.B.E., xlvii, pp. 94\u2013118.\nART. XVIII.\u2014The Chah\u00e1r Maq\u00e1la (\"Four Discourses\") of Nidh\u00e1m-i-'Ar\u00fadi-i-Samarqandi. Translated into English by Edward G. Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn my article on The Sources of Dawlatsh\u00e1h, which appeared in the January number of the Journal, I have already spoken of the excellent work which I now have the pleasure to present in English dress. For my translation I have used the T\u00edhr\u00e1n lithographed edition of A.H. 1305, which I have carefully collated throughout with the older of the two British Museum MSS. (Or. 3,507, dated A.H. 1017), and, in all doubtful passages, with the second MS. (Or. 2,955, dated A.H. 1274) also. These MSS. are fully described in Rieu's Persian Supplement, pp. 244\u2013245 and 265, Nos. 390 and 418. It remains only to say a few words concerning the author and the book.\n\nThe Chah\u00e1r Maq\u00e1la contains, as its name implies, four discourses, each of which treats of a class of men deemed by the author indispensable for the service of kings, to wit, (1) scribes (dab\u00edr\u00e1n) or secretaries; (2) poets; (3) astrologers; and (4) physicians. Each discourse begins with certain general considerations on the class in question, which are afterwards illustrated by anecdotes, drawn, in large measure, from the personal reminiscences of the author, who was himself a court-poet and a frequenter of royal assemblies. The total number of these anecdotes, which constitute at once the most entertaining and the most valuable portion of the book, is about forty, an average of ten to each \"discourse.\" So far as I know, only two of them, one concerning Firdaws\u00ed and the other about 'Umar Khayy\u00e1m, have hitherto been cited from this work. Of these the first (translated by Eth\u00e9 in vol. xlviii of the J.R.A.S. 1899.\nZ.D.M.G., pp. 89-94) was taken, not from the Chah\u00e1r Maq\u00e1la itself, but from Ibn Isfandiy\u00e1r's History of Tabarist\u00e1n, where it is quoted in extenso; while the second seems to have been known only in abridged citations, the misunderstanding of which gave rise to the Rose-tree cult of the 'Umar Khayy\u00e1m Society, referred to at p. 414 of the April number of the Journal.\n\nOf the excellent style of the Chah\u00e1r Maq\u00e1la, a style at once strong, concise, and pregnant with meaning, though not always easy or simple, I have already spoken at pp. 40, 63, 56-57, and 61-69 of the January number of the Journal, so that there is no occasion to insist upon it further. As, however, my translation will occupy two numbers of the Journal, it may be convenient that I should here give a brief table of its contents.\n\nIntroductory (Tehr\u00e1n ed., pp. 1-27).\n\n(1) Doxology, and Dedication to the Gh\u00farid Prince Abu'l-\u1e24asan 'Ali b.

His present work was written, at least in part, during the lifetime of 'Al\u00e1'u'd-D\u00edn \u1e24usayn Jah\u00e1n-s\u00faz (\"the World-consumer\"), who died in A.D. 1161, and since he speaks of himself as having been forty-five years in the service of the House of Gh\u00far, it is evident that he must have been born towards the end of the eleventh century of our era. The chief dates which he gives in the autobiographical portions of his work are as\nfollows. In A.H. 504 (A.D. 1110\u20131111) he heard traditions concerning R\u00fadagi at Samarqand (Anecdote xiii). In A.H. 506 (A.D. 1112\u20131113) he met \u2018Umar Khayy\u00e1m at Nish\u00e1p\u00far (Anecdote xxvii). In A.H. 509 (A.D. 1115\u20131116) he was at Her\u00e1t (Anecdote xvii). In the following year he was at Nish\u00e1p\u00far (Anecdote i) and T\u00fa\u0161 (Anecdotes xvi and xx), where he visited Firdaws\u00ed\u2019s tomb. His position and income were at this time precarious, but, encouraged by the poet Mu\u2019izz\u00ed, he succeeded in attracting the king\u2019s notice and winning his approval. In A.H. 512 (A.D. 1118\u20131119) he was again at Nish\u00e1p\u00far (Anecdote xxxi), and once more in A.H. 530 (A.D. 1135\u20131136), when he visited \u2018Umar Khayy\u00e1m\u2019s grave, and remarked the fulfilment of the prediction uttered by the Astronomer-poet twenty-four years earlier (Anecdote xxvii). In A.H. 547 (A.D. 1152\u20131153) he was involved in the defeat of the army of Gh\u00far by Sanjar b. Maliksh\u00e1h the Selj\u00fac, and was for a while in hiding at Her\u00e1t (Anecdotes xxx and xli). His life, in short, seems to have been spent chiefly in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n at royal courts, where he had opportunities of meeting many noteworthy persons. Though a poet by profession, he seems to have been equally ready to practise Astrology (Anecdote xxx) and Medicine (Anecdote xli). Of his personal character, as of his ability, his work produces, on the whole, a very favourable impression, and the book itself I should be disposed to describe as one of the most interesting, the most instructive, the most charming, and the best written Persian prose works which it has been my fortune to come across. Of this, however, the reader shall judge for himself.\n\nNotices of the writer occur in \u2018Awf\u00ed\u2019s Lub\u00e1bu\u2019l-Alb\u00e1b (ch. x, \u00a7 2, Poets of Transoxania), from which we learn nothing about his personality save that he bore the laqab of Najmu\u2019d-D\u00edn; Dawlatsh\u00e1h\u2019s Tadhkira (\u1e6cabaqa i, No. 13, pp. 60\u201361 of my forthcoming edition), where laudatory mention is made of the Chah\u00e1r Maq\u00e1la; H\u00e1ji Khalifa (No. 4,348, s.v. \u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645), who calls him Nidh\u00e1mu\u2019d-D\u00edn (instead of Najmu\u2019d-Din), which is probably correct; the\nMajma\u2018u-l-Fu\u1e63\u016b\u1e25\u00e1 of that most accomplished of recent Persian writers, Ri\u1e0d\u00e1-qul\u012b Kh\u00e1n (vol. i, p. 635), who places him higher as a prose-writer than as a poet; and, no doubt, other biographical works. But, leaving these aside, let us now allow the author to speak for himself, only premising that, where reference is made to various readings, the older MS. (Or. 3,507) is denoted by A, the other MS.

And blessings upon the Lord of both worlds, who was the most perfect of the Prophets, and invocations of grace upon his Companions and those of his Household, who were the most excellent of Saints and Vicars. And honour to the King of this time, that learned, just, divinely-favoured, victorious, and heaven-aided monarch, \u1e24us\u00e1mu\u2019d-Dawla wa\u2019d-Din, Helper of Isl\u00e1m and the Muslims, Exterminator of the infidels and polytheists, Subduer of the heretical and the froward, Supporter of hosts in the worlds, Pride of Kings and Emperors, Succourer of mankind, Protector of these days, Fore-arm of the Caliphate, Beauty of the Faith and Glory of the Nation, Order of the Arabs and the Persians, noblest of mankind, Shamsu\u2019l-Ma\u2018\u00e1l\u00ed,\n\n\u00b9 L. has \u0628\u064e\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0635\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064c, \u201cwithout the intervention.\u201d\nMaliku'l-Umar\u00e1, Abu'l-Hasan 'Al\u00ed b.

For to-day he is the most excellent of the kings of the age in nobility, pedigree, doughty deeds, judgement, statesmanship, justice, equity, valour, and generosity, as well as in the adorning of his territory, the embellishment of his realms, the maintenance of his friends, the subjugation of his foes, the raising of armies, the safeguarding of the people, the securing of the roads, and the tranquilizing of the realms, and also in that upright judgement, clear understanding, strong resolve, and firm determination, by the excellence of which the concatenation of the House of Shansab is held together and maintained in order, and by the perfection of which the strong arm of that Dynasty is strengthened and braced. May God Almighty give him full portion, together with the other kings of that line, of dominion and domain, and throne and fortune, by His Favour and His Grace!\n\nBut to proceed. It is an old custom and ancient practice, which custom is maintained and observed, that the Author, in the introduction to his discourse and preface of his book, should commemorate somewhat of his patron's praise, and record some prayer on behalf of the object of his eulogy. But I, a loyal servant, instead of praise and prayer for this prince, will make mention in this book of those favours ordained and vouchsafed by God Almighty to this King of kingly parentage, that, these being submitted to his world-illuminating judgement, he may betake himself to the expression of his thanks for them. For in\n\n1 This Prince belonged to the B\u0101miry\u0101n line of the Gh\u016brid Dynasty, was the son of Fakhru'd-D\u012bn Mas'ud, and brother of Shamsu'd-D\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad, and flourished in the latter part of the sixth century of the h\u012bjra.\n\n2 L. has \u0645\u0647\u0644\u0643\u060c \"from peril,\" instead of \u0645\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0643.\n\n3 See Tabag\u0101t-i-N\u016b\u1e63iri (ed.

Briefly, then, it behoves this great King and puissant Prince to know that to-day, upon the whole of this globe of dust, and within the circle of this green firmament, there is no king in more ample circumstances than this monarch, nor any potentate enjoying more abundant good than this sovereign. He hath the gift of youth and the blessing of constant health; his father and mother are alive; congenial brothers are on his right hand and on his left. And what father is like his sire, the mighty, divinely-strengthened, ever-victorious, heaven-aided Fakhru'd-Dawla wa'd-Din, Prince of the realms of Ir\u00e1n, King of the Mountains (may God prolong his continuance and continue to the heights his exaltation!), who is the most puissant of the monarchs of the age, and the most excellent of the princes of the time in judgement, statecraft, knowledge, chivalry, swordsmanship, strength of arm, treasure, and muniment! Supported by ten thousand men bearing spears and handling reins, he hath made himself a shield before his sons, so that no disturbing blast of the zephyr may so much as blow on one of their servants. Under his high protection and unassailable precaution (may God increase their degree!), prayers, of which each clause is breathed upwards at full morning-tide to the Court of God, co-operate with a far-trailing host and wheeling army. What a brother, too, like the royal Prince Shamsu'd-Dawla wa'd-Din, Light of Isl\u00e1m and the Muslims (may his victories be rendered glorious!), who reaches the extreme limit of endeavour in the service of this my master (whose exaltation may God perpetuate!).

God, glorious is His Name, hath accorded this position to the King of the age, and bestowed on him this degree, so that he may walk after the way of former kings and maintain the people after the manner of bygone ages.\n\nExcursus I.\n\nThe August Discernment (may God exalt it!) must know that every being which inhabits the Universe falls necessarily into one of two categories. Either it is a being which is self-existent, and is called 'the Necessarily Existent,' which is God Almighty, great is His Glory, who existeth by virtue of Himself, and who, therefore, hath existed for ever, since He dependeth not on aught else; and who was always, since He subsisteth by Himself, not by another. But that existence whose being is through another is called 'Contingent Being,' and this is such as we are, since our being is from the seed, and the seed is from the blood, and the blood is from food, and food is from the sun, the earth, the water and the air, which in turn are from something else; and all these are such as yesterday were not, and to-morrow will not be. Now when reflection is carried to the uttermost, it appeareth that this Causal Nexus reacheth upwards to a Cause which deriveth not its being from another, but existeth by itself; and that the Creator is all, and from Him all deriveth its existence and subsistence. And when this matter is somewhat pondered, it will become clear that\n\n\u00b9 Qur'\u00e1n, iv, 62.\nPhenomena consist of Being tinctured with Not-being, while He IS by a continuity which reaches from Eternity Past to Eternity to come. And since the essence of Phenomena is of Not-being, they must inevitably return again to nothing; and again, as touching the basis of the human race, it is said, \"Everything shall return unto its Origin,\" more especially in this world of Becoming and Decay. Therefore we, who are contingent in our being, have our origin in Not-being; while He, who existeth necessarily, is the Essence of Being, even as He (glorious is His state) saith in the Perspicuous Word and Firm Support, \"All things perish save His Countenance.\"\n\nNow you must know that this world lies in the hollow of the Heaven of the Moon and within the circle of this first sphere, and is called \"the World of Becoming and Decay.\" And you must thus conceive it, that within the concavity of the Heaven of the Moon lies the Orb of Fire, round about which extends the Heaven of the Moon; and that within the Heaven of Fire is the Air, surrounded by the Fire, and within the Air is the Water, surrounded by the Air, while within the Water is the earth, with the Water which abides it. And in the midst of the earth is an unchangeable point from which all straight lines drawn to the Heaven of the Moon are equal; and when we speak of \"below\" we mean this point and what lies nearest to it; and when we speak of \"up,\" we mean the sphere of the Heavenly Heaven, together with what lies nearest to it, also having a heaven above the Zodiacal Heaven, having nothing between it and with it the material world terminates.\n\n\u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0632\u0650\u062f\u064f \u0628\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0632\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064d \u0627\u0646\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0646\u062f\u064e\n\n1. But they say: \"the Prophets of the human race have said.\"\n\n2. This is the second of the nine celestial spheres which environ the Earth. Concerning the Muslim Cosmogony, see Dieterici's Makrokosmos, p. 375.\n\n3. The third of these celestial spheres is the Primum mobile of the Muslims, known as the Safi'at-Atlas or Falakul-Aflak of the Muslim philosophers.\nNow when God Almighty, by His effective Wisdom, desired to produce in this world minerals, plants, animals, and men, He created the stars, and in particular the sun and moon, whereon he made the growth and decay of these to depend. And the special property of the sun is this, that by its reflection it warms all things when it stands over against them, and supplies them through a medium with heat, and draws them up\u2014that is, attracts them. So, by its juxtaposition, it warmed the water; and by means of the warmth, attracted it; until, in a long while, it laid bare one quarter or more of the earth's surface, by reason of the much vapour which ascended and rose up therefrom.\n\nNow the nature of the water is this, that it can become stone, as it is well known to do in certain places, as may be actually witnessed.\\(^1\\) So mountains were produced from the water and the shining of the sun; and hereby the earth became somewhat raised from what it was, while the water sank and dried up, according to that fashion which is witnessed. This portion, therefore, is called 'the Uncovered Quarter,' for the reason above stated; and it is also called 'the Inhabited Quarter,' because animals dwell therein.\n\n**Excursus II.**\n\nWhen the influences of these stars had acted on the whole of\\(^2\\) these elements, they were reflected back from the midst of the earth and water, from that imaginary point [mentioned above], by the aid of the fire and wind, and the phenomena of the inorganic world were produced, such as mountains and mines, clouds, lightning, thunder, thunderbolts, shooting stars, comets, meteors,\\(^3\\) halos, conflagrations, earthquakes, and all manner of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The author alludes either to petrifaction and the formation of stalactites, or to ice.\n\n\\(^2\\) A., B., L. has \"\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0631,\" \"on [all] parts.\" L. has \u0648\u0642\u0633\u0637, which seems to me to be nonsense.\n\n\\(^3\\) A., B., L. add \u0648\u0639\u0635\u0628, a word of which I have been unable to ascertain the meaning.\nfountains, as has been fully explained in works treating of the effects of the celestial bodies, but for the explanation and discussion of which there is no room in this brief manual. But when time began, and the cycles of heaven became continuous, and the composition of this lower world became matured, and the time was come for the fertilization of that interspace which lay between the water and the air, the vegetable world was manifested. Then God, blessed and exalted is He, created for that substance whereby the plants were made manifest four subservient forces and three faculties. Of these four subservient forces, one was that which kept drawing to it whatever was suitable for its purpose, and this is called 'Attraction' (Jaddhiba). Another keeps what the first may have attracted, and this is called 'Fixation' (Miskh). The third is that which assimilates what has been attracted, and transmutes it from its former state until it becomes like unto itself, and this is called 'Assimilation' (Hujma). The fourth is that which rejects what is not appropriate, and is called 'Excretion' (Daf'a).\n\nAnd of the three faculties, one is that which increaseth it by diffusing throughout it nutritious matters with a suitable and equal diffusion. The second is that which accompanies this increment until it reaches the extremities. The third is that which, when the organism has attained perfection and begins to tend towards defect, appears and produces germs, in order that, if destruction overtake the parent in this world, these may become its substitute and representative, so that the order of the world may be guarded from interruption, and the species may not cease. This is called the 'Reproductive Faculty' (Quwicat-i-Muwallida).\n\nSo this kingdom rose superior to the mineral and vegetable kingdoms in these several ways which have been mentioned; and the far-reaching Wisdom of the Creator so ordained, that these kingdoms should be connected successively and continuously, so that in the mineral kingdom the first thing which attained completeness and underwent the process of evolution became higher in organization until it grew to that (masu', i.e., Assad), which is the ultimate term of\nthe mineral world,\\(^1\\) until it was connected with the first stage of plant life. And the first thing in the vegetable kingdom is the thorn, and the last the date-palm, which has been assimilated to the animal kingdom, since it needs the male to fertilize it so that it may bear fruit;\\(^2\\) while another [member of this kingdom] flees from its foe, for the vine flees from the 'ashaqa,\\(^3\\) a plant which, when it twists round the vine, causes it to shrivel up. In the vegetable kingdom, therefore, there is nothing higher than the date-palm and the vine, inasmuch as they are connected with the superior kingdom, and have outstepped the limits of their own world, and have evolved themselves in a higher direction.\n\n**Excursus III.**\n\nNow when this kingdom had attained perfection, and the influence of the 'Fathers' of the upper world had worked on the 'Mothers'\\(^4\\) below, and these had assumed a finer temper, and the interspace between the air and the fire became involved, and a finer offspring resulted, the manifestation of the animal world took place. This took to itself the faculties possessed by the vegetable kingdom, and added thereunto two others, one the faculty of discovery, which is called the 'Perceptive Faculty' (\\(Mudrika\\)), whereby the animal discerns things; the second the power of voluntary movement, by the help of which the animal moves automatically, approaching that which is agreeable to it and retreating from that which is offensive to it; and this is called the 'Motor Faculty' (\\(Muharrika\\)).\n\nNow the Perceptive Faculty is subdivided into ten branches, five of which are called the External Senses and five the Internal Senses. The former are Touch, Taste, Hearing, Sight,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Pearl, however, seems generally to be placed higher. See Dieterici's *Mikrokoosmos*, p. 11.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Dieterici's *Mikrokoosmos*, p. 25.\n\n\\(^3\\) A species of Dolichos. See Lane's Arabic Lexicon, s.v.\n\n\\(^4\\) By the 'Seven Fathers above' and the 'Four Mothers below' the seven planets and the four elements are intended.\nand Smell. Now Touch is a sense distributed throughout the flesh and skin of the animal, so that the nerves perceive and discern anything which touches it, such as dryness and moisture, heat and cold, roughness and smoothness, harshness and softness. Taste is a sense located in that nerve which is distributed over the surface of the tongue, which apprehends tastes and dissolved flavours from those bodies which come in contact with it; and it is this sense which discriminates between sweet and bitter, sharp and sour, and the like of these. Hearing is a sense located in the nerve which is distributed about the auditory meatus, so that it detects any sound which is discharged against it by undulations of the air compressed between two impinging bodies, that is to say, two bodies brought into contact with one another, by the impact of which the air is thrown into waves and becomes the cause of sound, inasmuch as it acts upon the air which is stationary in the auditory meatus, comes into contact with it, reaches this nerve, and gives rise to the sensation of hearing. Sight is a faculty located in two nerve-balls, which discerns images projected on the crystalline humour, whether of figures or solid bodies, variously coloured by the medium of a translucent substance which subsists between it and the surfaces of reflecting bodies. Smell is a faculty located in a protuberance situated in the fore part of the brain and resembling the nipple of the female breast, which apprehends what the air inhaled brings to it of odours mingled with the vapours wafted by air-currents, or what is impressed upon it by diffusion from the odoriferous body.\n\nThe Five Internal Senses.1 Now as to the Internal Senses; some are such as perceive sense-impressions, while others are such as apprehend ideas. The first is the 'Composite Sense' (Hass-i-mushturika), which is a faculty located in the anterior ventricles of the brain, and receptive into itself of any image apprehended by the external senses, or impressed upon them for communication to it, such\n\n1 See my Year amongst the Persians, pp. 144, 145.\nperception being apprehended only when received by it. The second is the Imagination (Khay\u00e1l), a faculty located in the posterior ventricles of the second convolution of the brain, which preserves what the Composite Sense has apprehended from the external senses, so that this remains in it after the subsidence of the sense-impressions. The third is the 'Imaginative Faculty' (Mutakhayyila), thus called when animals are under discussion, but, in the case of the human soul, named the 'Cogitative Faculty' (Mutafakkira). This is a faculty located in the middle ventricle of the brain, whose function it is to co-ordinate with one another, and to preserve, those particular percepts which are stored in the Imagination, and to keep them distinct from one another by the control of thought. The fourth is the 'Apprehensive Faculty' (Wahima), which is a faculty located in the extremity of the middle ventricle of the brain. Its function is to discover the supra-sensual ideas existing in particular percepts. By it the kid distinguishes between its dam and a wolf, and the child between a piece of rope and a serpent. The fifth is the 'Retentive Faculty' (H\u00e1fdha), also called the 'Memory' (Dh\u00e1kira), which is a faculty located in the posterior ventricle of the brain. It preserves those supra-sensual ideas discovered by the Apprehension; between which and itself the same relation subsists as between the Imagination and the Composite Sense, though the latter preserves forms and the former ideas.\n\nNow all these are the servants of the Animal Soul, a substance having its well-spring in the heart, which, when it acts in the heart, is called the Animal Spirit, but when in the brain, the Psychic Spirit, and when in the liver, the Natural Spirit. It is a subtle vapour which rises from the blood, diffuses itself to the remotest arteries, and resembles the sun in luminosity. Every animal which possesses these Perceptive and Motor faculties, and these ten subordinate faculties derived therefrom, is called a perfect animal; but if any faculty is lacking in it, defective. Thus the snake has no ears, the ant no eyes, and these two are called deaf and blind; but none is more defective than the maggot,\n\nJ.B.A.S. 1899.\nwhich is a red worm found in the mud of streams, called therefore *g\u012bl-khw\u0101ra* (\"mud-eater\"), but in Transoxania *Z\u0101dik-kirma* (?). This is the lowest animal, while the highest is the *s\u016btr* (*nas\u016bds*), a creature inhabiting the plains of Turkist\u00e1n, of erect carriage, of vertical stature, with wide flat nails. It cherishes a great affection for men; wherever it sees them, it halts on their path and examines them attentively; and when it finds a solitary man, it carries him off; nay, it is even said that it will conceive from him. This, after mankind, is the highest of animals, inasmuch as in several respects it resembles man; first, in its erect stature; secondly, in the breadth of its nails and in the hair of its head.\n\n**Anecdote i.**\n\nI heard as follows from Ab\u00fa Rid\u00e1 b. 'Abdu's-Sal\u00e1m of Nish\u00e1p\u00fcr, in the Great Mosque at Nish\u00e1p\u00fcr, in the year A.H. 319 (=A.D. 1116-1117):\u2014\"We were travelling towards Tashkent,\" and in our caravan were several thousand camels. One day, when we were marching in the midday heat, we saw on a hillock a woman, bare-headed, extremely beautiful in form, with a figure like a cypress, a face like the moon, and long hair, standing and looking at us. Although I spoke to her, she made no reply; and when I approached her, she fled, running so swiftly in her flight that no horse could overtake her.

In the first case it is used of various kinds of monkeys, e.g. the orang-outang and chimpanzee; in the latter it is equivalent to the *Shigg* or Half-man (which resembles a man cut in two vertically) of the Arabs, and the *Div-mardum* of the Persians. See Ghazwini's *As\u0101'idu'l-Makh\u0101lid*, p. 449; and my *Year amongst the Nomads*, pp. 168, 207.\n3. See Ghazwini's *As\u0101'idu'l-Bid\u0101d*, p. 275.\n4. The meaning of this word is conjectural. The sentence runs in A: \"\u0648\u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u062f.\" B. has \"\u0648\u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u062f\", otherwise the sense is A. In L. the sentence runs: \"\u0648\u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u062f.\"\nTurks, said that this was a wild man, such as they call nasn\u00e1s.\"\n\nNow you must know that it is nobler than other animals in these three respects which have been mentioned.\n\nSo when, by lapse of long ages and time, organization waxes more delicate, the moment comes for that interaction which takes place between the elements and the heavens, and man comes into being, bringing with him all that existed in the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, to which is added the capacity for intellectual concepts. So he becomes king over all, and brings all things under his control. For from the mineral world he made jewels, gold and silver his embellishment and adornment, while from iron, tin, copper, and lead he fashioned utensils for his use. From the vegetable kingdom also he made his food and raiment and carpets; and from the animal world he provided himself with steeds and beasts of burden. Moreover, from all three kingdoms he chose out medicaments wherewith to heal himself. Whence did there accrue to him all this superiority? By this, that he knew himself, and, by means of intellectual concepts, knew God. \"He who knoweth himself, knoweth his Lord.\"\n\nSo this kingdom [of man] became divided into three classes. The first is that class which is proximate to the Animal Kingdom, such as the wild men of the waste and the mountain, whose intelligence doth not more than suffice to secure their own livelihood, seek their own advantage, and ward off what is to their detriment. The second class compriseth the inhabitants of towns and cities, who possess civilization, mutually assist one another, and discover crafts and arts; but whose scientific attainments are limited to the organizing of such association as subsists between them, to the end that the different classes may continue to exist. The third class comprises such as are independent of these things, whose occupation, by night and by day, in secret and in public, is to reflect, \"Who\n\n1 Or perhaps \"races.\" The word is \u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646.\nare we; for what reason did we come into existence, and who hath brought us into being?\" In other words they hold debate concerning the real essences of things, reflect on their coming, and anxiously consider their departure, saying, \"How have we come? Whither do we go?\"\n\nThis class, again, is subdivided into two sorts; first, those who reach the essence of this object by means of masters, by laborious toil and absorption, and by reading and writing; and such are called philosophers. But there is yet another sort who, without master or book, reach the extreme limit of this problem, and these are called prophets.\n\nNow, the peculiar virtues of the Prophet are three: first, that, without instruction, he knows all knowledges; secondly, that he gives information concerning yesterday and to-morrow otherwise than by analogical reasoning; and thirdly, that his soul hath such power that from whatever body he will he taketh the form and produceth another form, which thing none can do save such as are conformed to the Angelic World. Therefore in the Human World none is above him, and his command is effective for the well-being of the world; for whatever they have, he has, while possessing also an additional qualification which they have not, that is to say, communion with the Angelic World. This additional qualification is in brief termed the Prophetic Function, and is in detail such as we have explained.\n\nNow, so long as such a man lives, he points out to his people what things conduce to well-being in both worlds, by the Command of God, glorious is His Name, communicated to him by means of the Angels. But when, by natural dissolution, he turns his face towards the other world, he leaves behind him a Code derived from the indications of God Almighty and his own sayings. And necessarily he requires to act as his substitute, and to maintain his Law and Practice, a vicegerent, who must needs be the most excellent of mankind and the most perfect product of his age, in order that he may revive this Law and carry out this Practice; and such an one\nis called an *Im\u00e1m*. This *Im\u00e1m* can cope with the disasters of the East and the West, the North and the South, in such wise that the effects of his care extend alike to the most remote and the nearest, while his command and prohibition reach alike the intelligent and the ignorant. But he must needs have vicars to act for him in distant parts of the world, and not every one of these will have such power that all mankind shall be compelled to admit it. Hence there must be a leader, an administrator, a compeller, which administrator and compeller is called a *Monarch*, that is to say, a *King*; and his vicarious function *Sovereignty*. The King, therefore, is the lieutenant of the *Im\u00e1m*, the *Im\u00e1m* of the Prophet, and the Prophet of God (mighty and glorious is He!).\n\nWell has it been said on this subject:\n\n\"Then know that the functions of *Prophet* and *King* Are set side by side like two stones in one ring.\"\n\nKnow, therefore, that the Regal and Prophetic offices are as two jewels in one ring, for the Prince of the sons of men himself hath said \"*State* and *Church* are twins,\" since in form and essence neither differs, either as regards increase or defect, from the other. So, by virtue of this decree, no burden, after the Prophetic office, is weightier than Sovereignty, nor any function more laborious than that of governing. Hence a king needs round about him, as men on whose counsel, judgement, and deliberations depend the loosing and binding of the world, and the well-being and ill-being of the servants of God Almighty, such as are in every case the most excellent and most perfect of their time.\n\nNow of the special ministers of Kings are the Secretary, the Poet, the Astrologer, and the Physician, and these can in no wise be dispensed with. For the maintenance of the administration is by the Secretary; the perpetuation of immortal renown by the Poet; the ordering of affairs by the Astrologer; and the health of the body by the Physician.\nThese four arduous functions and noble arts are amongst the branches of the Science of Philosophy; the functions of the Scribe and the Poet being branches of the Science of Logic; that of the Astrologer, one of the principal subdivisions of Mathematics; while the Physician's Art is amongst the branches of Natural Science. This book, therefore, comprises Four Discourses, to wit:\n\nFirst Discourse, on the essence of the Secretarial Art, and the nature of the Secretary.\n\nSecond Discourse, on the essence of the Poetic Art, and what it behoves the Poet to be.\n\nThird Discourse, on the essence of the Science of Astrology, and the distinguishing signs of the Astrologer.\n\nFourth Discourse, on the essence of the Science of Medicine, and the function and nature of the Physician.\n\nIn all these divisions of Philosophy, then, that will be advanced which is appropriate to this book; and thereafter ten pleasing anecdotes, of the choicest connected with that subject and the rarest germane to that topic, of what hath befallen persons of the class under discussion, will be added, in order that it may become plainly known to the King that the Secretarial Office is not a trivial matter; that the Poetic Calling is no mean occupation; that Astrology is a necessary Science; that Medicine is indispensable; and that the wise King cannot do without these four persons\u2014the Scribe, the Poet, the Astrologer, and the Physician.\n\nFirst Discourse.\n\nOn the Essence of the Secretarial Function and the Nature of the Perfect Scribe.\n\nThe Secretarial Function is an art comprising reasoned modes of address and communication, and teaching the forms of address employed amongst men in correspondence, consultation, contention, eulogy, condemnation, diplomacy, provocation, and conciliation, as well as in magnifying\nmatters or minimizing them; contriving means of excuse or censure; imposing covenants; recording antecedents; and displaying, in every case, orderly arrangement, so that all may be enunciated primarily and finally.\n\nHence the Secretary must be of gentle birth, of refined honour, of penetrating discernment, of profound reflection, and of firm judgement; and the amplest portion and fullest share of the methods and attainments of this art must be his. Neither must he be remote from, or unacquainted with, logical judgements; and he must know the ranks of his contemporaries, and be familiar with the dignities of the leading men of his time. Moreover, he should not be absorbed in the wealth and perishable goods of this world; nor concern himself with the approval or condemnation of prejudiced persons and tattlers, or pay any heed to them; and he should, when exercising his secretarial functions, guard the honour of his master from degrading situations and dangerous practices. And in the course of his letter, while pursuing his duties of correspondence, he should not quarrel with eminent and powerful personages; and, even though enmity subsist between his master and the person whom he is addressing, he should restrain his pen, and not attack him, save in the case of one who may have overstepped his own proper limit, or advanced his foot beyond the circle of respect, for they say: \"One for one,\" and he who begins is most in the wrong.\"\n\nAnd in his forms of address he should observe moderation, writing to each person that which befits his position, whereunto his kingdom, domain, army, and treasure are a guide; save in the case of one who may himself have fallen short in this matter, or made display of undue pride, or neglected some point of courtesy, or manifested an arrogance which reason cannot regard otherwise than as misplaced in such\n\n1 i.e., \"once and for all,\" with such clearness as to leave no ambiguity, or ground for future dispute.\n\n2 i.e., \"Tit for tat, and the aggressor is most to blame.\"\ncorrespondence, and unsuitable in epistolary communications. In such cases it is permitted and allowed to the Scribe to take up his pen, set his best foot forward, and in this pass go to the extreme limit and utmost bound, for they say: \"Hasty writing towards the hasty is a good work.\" But in no case must he suffer any dust from the atmosphere of conflict in this arena of correspondence to alight on the skirt of his master's honour; and in the setting forth of his message he must adopt that method which the orators of the Arabs have thus described: \"The best speech is that which is brief and significant, and not wearisome.\" For if the discussion runs with the words, the discussion will be protracted, and the Scribe will be stigmatized as prolix, and \"Books are piled up in a builder.\"\n\nNow the words of the Scribe will not attain to this elevation until he becomes familiar with every science, learns from every master, hears some aphorism from every philosopher, and borrows some elegance from every style. Therefore he must accustom himself to the Scripture of the Lord of Glory, the Traditions of the Chosen One (on whom, and on whose blessing and peace), the Memoirs of the Prophets, the proverbial sayings of the Arabs, and the works of the Persians; and to read the books of antiquity, and to study the writings of their successors, such as the compositions of the \u015eahib Isma'il ibn 'Abb\u00e1d, the \"Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-n\u00e1m\u00e9\"; the compositions of Ham\u00e1d\u00ed, the \"Qul\u00e1ma\"; the Gests of Badi'u'z-Zam\u00e1n.\n\n---\n\n1. \"Hasty writing towards the hasty is a good work.\"\n2. \"The best speech is that which is brief and significant, and not wearisome.\"\n3. \"Books are piled up in a builder.\"\n4. \"Prophets,\" \"Memoirs of the Prophets,\" \"Proverbial sayings of the Arabs,\" \"Works of the Persians,\" \"Books of antiquity,\" \"Writings of their successors,\" \"Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-n\u00e1m\u00e9,\" \"Qul\u00e1ma,\" \"Gests of Badi'u'z-Zam\u00e1n.\"\nal-Hamad\u00e1n\u00ed,\u00b9 al-\u1e24ar\u00edr\u00ed,\u00b9 and al-\u1e24am\u00edd\u00ed\u00b2; the Rescripts of al-Bal\u2019ami,\u00b3 Ahm\u00e1d-i-\u1e24asan,\u2074 and Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r Kundur\u00ed\u2075; the Letters of Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Abd, \u2018Abdu\u2019l-\u1e24am\u00edd, and the Sayyidu\u2019r-Ru\u2019as\u00e1; the S\u00e9ances of Mu\u1e25ammad-i-Man\u1e63\u00far,\u2076 Ibn \u2018Abb\u00e1d\u00ed,\u2077 and Ibnu\u2019n-Nass\u00e1ba, the descendant of \u2018Al\u00ed; and, of the poetical works of the Arabs, the Div\u00e1ns of Mutanabb\u00ed,\u2078 Ab\u00edward\u00ed,\u2079 and Ghazz\u00ed\u00b9\u2070; and, amongst the Persian poets, the poems of \u1e24ak\u00edm R\u00fadag\u00ed,\u00b9\u00b9 the Epic of Firdaws\u00ed,\u00b9\u00b2 and the panegyrics of \u2018Un\u1e63ur\u00ed\u00b9\u00b3; since each one of these works which we have enumerated was, after its kind, the incomparable and unique product of its time; and every scribe who hath these books, and stimulates his mind, polishes his wit, and enkindles his fancy by their perusal, will ever raise the level of his diction, whereby a scribe becomes famous.\n\nNow if he be well acquainted with the Qur\u2019\u00e1n, with one verse therefrom he may discharge his obligation to a whole realm, as did Isk\u00e1fi.\u00b9\u2074\n\n\u00b9 See Von Kremer\u2019s Culturgesch., ii, pp. 470\u2013476; Brockelmann\u2019s Gesch. d.

He discharged the duties of secretary in the Chancellery of N\u00fah b. Mans\u00far, but they did not properly recognize his worth, or bestow on him favours adequate to his pre-eminence. He therefore fled from Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1 to Alptag\u00edn at Her\u00e1t. Alptag\u00edn, a Turk, wise and discerning, made much of him, and confided to him the Chancellery, so that at length he became one of his ministers. Now because there had sprung up at the court a new nobility who made light of the old nobles, while Alptag\u00edn patiently bore their presumption, matters at last culminated in rebellion, by reason of some slight put upon him. Then Amir N\u00fah, incited by a party of the new nobles, wrote from Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1 to Z\u00e1bulist\u00e1n that Sabuktagin should come with that army, and the sons of Simj\u00far with their army from N\u00edsh\u00e1p\u00far, and should make war on Alptag\u00edn. And this war is very celebrated, and the event most notorious.\n\nSo when these armies reached Her\u00e1t, the Am\u00edr \u2018Al\u00ed b. Mu\u1e25t\u00e1j sent Kis\u00e1\u2019i, who was the Chief Chamberlain (S\u00e1\u1e25ibu\u2019l-B\u00e1b), to Alptag\u00edn, with a letter like fire and water blended together, containing threats and menaces which left no room for peace and no way for conciliation, such as an angry master might write in his absence to his disobedient\n\n---\n\n1 This seems to be an error (though it stands thus in all three copies) for Mans\u00far b. N\u00fah (Mans\u00far I.), who reigned A.H. 350\u2013366; for N\u00fah b. Mans\u00far (N\u00fah II.) reigned A.H. 366\u2013387, and Alptag\u00edn died in A.H. 352 or 354. Concerning the Diw\u00e1nu\u2019r-Ras\u016b\u2019il, see Von Kremer\u2019s Culturgeschicht. d. Arab., i, pp. 174, 200; and A. de B. Kazimirski\u2019s Menouchehri, pp. 36 and 43. According to Ibnu\u2019l-Athir (Bul\u00e1q ed. of A.H. 1303, vol. viii, p. 179), Alptag\u00edn\u2019s revolt took place in A.H. 351.\n\n2 See Defr\u00e9my\u2019s Hist. des Samanides, pp. 260, 261.\n\n3 Concerning this general, see Defr\u00e9my\u2019s Hist. des Samanides, p. 248.\n\n4 A. has \u0623\u0644\u0643\u0634\u0627\u064a both here and in l. 4 of the next page, and in the second place adds \u2018Ak b. Mu\u1e25t\u00e1j after Abu\u2019l-\u1e24asan.\nservants, the whole letter filled with such expressions as \"I will come,\" \"I will take,\" \"I will bind,\" \"I will strike,\" \"I will slay.\" When the Chamberlain Abu'l-Hasan Kis\u00e1'\u00ed submitted this letter and delivered the message, not withholding aught, Alptag\u00edn, who was already vexed, grew more vexed, and broke out in anger, saying: \"I was his father's servant, but when my master passed from this transitory to that eternal abode, he entrusted him to me, not me to him. Although, to outward seeming, I should obey him, it is in fact quite otherwise, for when you examine this matter, a contrary conclusion results, seeing that I am in the last stages of old age, and he in the first stages of youth. Those who have impelled him to act thus are destroyers of this Dynasty, not counsellors, and are overthrowers of this house, not supporters.\"\n\nThen he asked of Isk\u00e1fi, \"How wilt thou answer this letter?\" Isk\u00e1fi, on the spur of the moment, wrote the first draft of the answer as follows:\n\n\"In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Clement. O N\u00fah, thou hast contended with us and made great the contention with us. Produce, then, that wherewith thou threatenest us, if thou art of those who speak truly.\"\u00b9\n\nWhen this letter reached N\u00fah b. Man\u1e63\u00far, the Am\u00edr of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, he read it, and was astonished; and all the gentlemen of the court were filled with amaze, and the scribes bit their fingers in wonder. And when the affair of Alptag\u00edn was disposed of, Isk\u00e1fi fled away privily, for he was fearful and terrified; until suddenly N\u00fah sent a messenger to him to summon him to his presence, and conferred on him the post of Secretary. So his affairs prospered, and he became conspicuous and famous amongst the votaries of the Pen. Had he not known the Qur'\u00e1n, he would not thus have distinguished himself on this occasion, nor would his position have risen from the station he occupied to this high degree.\n\n\u00b9 Qur'\u00e1n, xi, 34.\nWhen Isk\u00e1fi's affairs waxed thus prosperous, and he became established in the service of N\u00fah b. Mans\u00far, M\u00e1k\u00e1n the son of K\u00e1k\u00ed\u00b9 rebelled at Ray and in K\u00fahist\u00e1n, withdrew his neck from the yoke of obedience, sent his agents to Khw\u00e1r, Samn\u00e1n and Simnak, captured several of the towns of K\u00famish,\u00b2 and paid no heed to the S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00edds. N\u00fah b. Mans\u00far was afraid, because this was a formidable and able man, and set himself to deal with this matter. He therefore ordered T\u00e1sh, the commander-in-chief, to march against him with seven thousand horsemen, suppress this sedition, and put an end to this grave incident in whatever way he deemed most expedient.\n\nNow T\u00e1sh was very wise and clear in judgement, emerging swiftly and skilfully from the straitest passes; and he was also victorious in warfare, and had never turned back in defeat from any one of the countless battles he had waged, nor come forth worsted from any campaign. While he lived, the dominion and authority of the House of S\u00e1m\u00e1n enjoyed the greatest brilliancy and prosperity.\n\nOn this occasion, then, the Am\u00edr, being much preoccupied and distressed, sent a messenger to summon Isk\u00e1fi, and held a private interview with him. \"I am greatly troubled,\" said he, \"by this occurrence; for M\u00e1k\u00e1n is a brave man, and an able, and hath, in addition to his bravery and courage, administrative capacity and generosity, so that there have been few like him amongst the Daylam\u00eds. You must co-operate with T\u00e1sh, and whatever he lacks for the raising of an army at this juncture, you must supply.\n\n\u00b9 The chronological difficulties involved in these two stories are considerable, for the rebellion of M\u00e1k\u00e1n b. K\u00e1k\u00ed occurred in A.H. 329, towards the end of the reign of Na\u1e63r II b. Ahmad, i.e. long before the rebellion of Alptag\u00edn (see n. 1 on p. 638, supra). See Defr\u00e9my's Samanides, pp. 248 and 263-4.\n\n\u00b2 Better known as Q\u00famis, the Arabicized form of the name. See B. de Meynard's Dict. G\u00e9ogr., Histor., et Litt. de la Perse, pp. 464-5. For the three other towns mentioned, see the same work, pp. 213, 317, and 318.\nAnd I will establish myself at Nish\u00e1pur, so that the army may be supported from the base, and the foeman discouraged. Every day a swift messenger must come from you to me with dispatches, wherein you must set forth the pith of what may have happened, so that my anxieties may be assuaged.\u201d Isk\u00e1fi bowed and said, \u201cI will obey.\u201d\n\nSo next day T\u00e1sh unfurled his standard, sounded his drums, and set out for the front from Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1, crossing the Oxus with seven thousand horsemen; while the Amir followed him with the remainder of the army to N\u00edsh\u00e1pur. There he invested T\u00e1sh and the army with robes of honour; and T\u00e1sh, raising his standard, marched into Bayhaq, whence he marched forwards into K\u00famish to confront the enemy, with fixed purpose and in the best of spirits.\n\nMeanwhile M\u00e1k\u00e1n, with ten thousand mailed men, was encamped at the gates of Ray, where he had taken up his position. T\u00e1sh arrived, passed by the city, and encamped over against him. Then messengers passed to and fro between them, but no settlement was effected, for M\u00e1k\u00e1n was puffed up with pride on account of that formidable army which he had gathered together from every quarter. It was therefore decided that they should join battle.\n\nNow T\u00e1sh was an aged warrior, who for forty years had held the position of commander-in-chief, and had witnessed many such engagements; and he so manoeuvred that when the two armies met, and the doughty warriors and champions of Transoxania and Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n moved forward from the centre, only half of M\u00e1k\u00e1n\u2019s army was engaged, while the rest were not fighting. M\u00e1k\u00e1n was slain, and T\u00e1sh, when he had ceased from taking and binding and slaying, turned to Isk\u00e1fi and said, \u201cA carrier-pigeon must be sent in advance, to be followed later by a courier: but all the main features of the battle must be summed up in one sentence, which shall indicate all the circumstances, yet shall not exceed what a pigeon can carry, and shall adequately express our meaning.\u201d\n\nThen Isk\u00e1fi took so much paper as two fingers would cover and wrote:\u2014\u201cIn the Name of God, the Merciful, the\nClement. As for M\u00e1k\u00e1n, he hath become as his name\u201d\u00b9 [M\u00e1 k\u00e1n = \u201cHe hath not been\u201d in Arabic]. By this \u201cm\u00e1\u201d he intended the negative, and by \u201ck\u00e1n,\u201d the verb substantive, so that the Persian of it would be, \u201cM\u00e1k\u00e1n hath become like his name,\u201d that is to say, hath become nothing.\n\nWhen the carrier-pigeon reached the Am\u00edr N\u00fah, he was not more delighted at the victory than at this dispatch, and he ordered Isk\u00e1fi\u2019s salary to be increased, saying: \u201cSuch a person must maintain a heart free from care in order to attain to such delicacies of expression.\u201d\u00b2\n\nAnecdote iv.\n\nOne who pursues any craft which depends on reflection ought to be free from care and anxiety, for if it be otherwise, the arrows of his thought will fly wide and will not hit the target of achievement, since only by a tranquil mind can one arrive at such words.\n\nIt is related that a certain Secretary of the \u2018Abb\u00e1sid Caliphs was writing a letter to the governor of Egypt; and, his mind being tranquil and himself submerged in the ocean of reflection, was forming sentences precious as pearls of great price and fluent as running water. Suddenly his maidservant entered, saying, \u201cThere is no flour left.\u201d The scribe was so put out and disturbed in mind that he lost the thread of his diction, and was so affected that he wrote in the letter \u201cThere is no flour left.\u201d When he had finished it, he sent it to the Caliph, having no knowledge of these words which he had written.\n\nWhen the letter reached the Caliph, and he read it, and saw this sentence, he was greatly astonished, being unable to account for so strange an occurrence. So he sent a messenger to summon the scribe, and inquired of him\n\n\u00b9 \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u0627\u0633\u0645\u0647\n\u00b2 The substance of this anecdote is given in the T\u00e1rikh-i-G\u00facida, and is cited by Defr\u00e9my at pp. 247\u20138 of his Histoire des Samanides (Paris, 1846).\nconcerning this. The scribe was covered with shame, and gave the true explanation of the matter. The Caliph was mightily astonished and said: \"The beginning of this letter excels the latter part by as much as the s\u00fbra 'Say, He is God, the One' excels the s\u00fbra 'The hands of Ab\u00fa Lahab shall perish,' and it is a pity to surrender the minds of eloquent men like you into the hands of the struggle for the necessaries of life.\" Then he ordered him to be given means sufficiently ample to prevent such an announcement as this from ever entering his ears again. Naturally it then happened that he could compress into two sentences the ideas of two worlds.\n\nAnecdote v.\n\nThe S\u00e1hib Isma'il ibn 'Abb\u00e1d, entitled al-K\u00e1fi (\"the Competent\"), of Ray, was minister to the Sh\u00e1hansh\u00e1h. He was most perfect in his accomplishments, of which fact his correspondence and his poetry are two sufficient witnesses and unimpeachable arbiters.\n\nNow the S\u00e1hib was a man of just dealings, and such are wont to be extremely pious and scrupulous in their religious duties, not holding it right that a true believer should abide eternally in hell by reason of a grain of [righteous] enmity; and his servants and retainers and agents for the most part followed his example.\n\nNow there was at Qum a judge appointed by the S\u00e1hib in whose godliness and piety he had the firmest belief, though there were some who asserted the contrary, and brought information against him, which, however, left the S\u00e1hib unconvinced, until certain trustworthy persons of Qum, whose statements commanded credence, declared that\n\n1 Qur'an, cxii.\n2 Qur'an, cxii.\n3 For an account of this great minister and generous patron of literature, see De Slane's translation of Ibn Khallik\u00e1n, vol. i, pp. 212-217, and n. 4 on p. 696, supra.\n4 So B.

This was mightily displeasing to the \u015e\u00e2hib for two reasons, first on account of the greatness of the bribe, and secondly on account of the shameless unscrupulousness of the judge. He at once took up his pen and wrote:\n\n\"In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Clement. O Judge of Qum! We dismiss you, so Come!\"\u00b9\n\nScholars and rhetoricians will notice and appreciate the high merit of this sentence in respect of its brevity, concision, and clearness, and naturally from that time forth rhetoricians and stylists have inscribed this epigram on their hearts, and repeat it to the people of the world.\n\nAnecdote vi.\n\nLamgh\u00e1n\u00b2 is a city in the district of Sind, one of the dependencies of Ghazna; and at this present time naught but one range of mountains separates its inhabitants from the heathen, so that they live in constant dread of the attacks and raids of the unbelievers. Yet the men of Lamgh\u00e1n are of good courage, sharp and frugal, and combining with their sharpness no small rascality,\u00b3 to such a degree that they think nothing of lodging a complaint against a tax-gatherer on account of a maund of chaff or a single egg; while for even less than this they were ready to come to Ghazna to complain of exactions, and would remain there one or two months, and then return without having accomplished their object. In short, they are wonderful hands at patience, and are most stiffnecked in importunity.\n\nI have endeavoured to preserve, feebly enough, the word-play in the original.\n\n\u00b9 Or L\u00e1magh\u00e1n. See B. de Meynard's Dict. G\u00e9ogr. de la Perse, p. 503; Pavet de Courteille's M\u00e9m. de Baber, ii, pp. 120, 121.\n\n\u00b2 The texts differ considerably in this sentence. I follow A., which has:\n\n\u0627\u064e\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0645\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0648\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u062c\u0644\u062f \u0648 \u0643\u0633\u0628 \u0648 \u0628\u0627 \u062c\u0644\u062f\u064a \u0632\u0639\u0631\u064a \u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645...\nNow in the reign of Sultan Mahmud Yaminu'd-Dawla, the heathen one night attacked them, and damage of every sort befell them. But these were men who could raise a harvest without soil; and when this event happened several of their chiefs and men of note rose up and came to Ghazna, and, with their garments rent, their heads uncovered, and uttering loud lamentations, entered the bazaar of Ghazna, went to the King's Palace wailing and grieving, and so described their misfortune that even a stone would have been moved to tears. As their rascality, impudence, dissimulation, and cunning had not yet become apparent, that great minister, Ahmad Hasan of Maymand, took pity upon them, and forgave them that year's taxes, exempting them from all exactions, and bidding them return home, strive more strenuously, and spend less, so that by the beginning of the next year they might recover their former position.\n\nSo the deputation of Lamghanis returned with great contentment and huge satisfaction, and continued during that year in the easiest of circumstances, divulging their secret to no one. When the year came to an end, the same deputation returned to present another petition to the minister, simply setting forth that in the past year their lord the great minister had brightened their country by his grace and clemency and had effectively extended to them his protection, so that they were now able to dwell in peace on that border; but that, since their prosperity was still somewhat shaken, they feared that, should he demand the contribution on their possessions that year, some of them would be utterly ruined, and that, as a consequence of this, loss might accrue to the royal coffers.\n\nThe minister, therefore, extending his favour, excused them the taxes of yet another year. During these two years the people of Lamghan grew rich, but this did not suffice them, for in the third year their greed reasserted\n\n---\n\n1 See n. 4 on p. 637, supra.\n2 This I take to be the meaning of \u0622\u0628 \u0628\u06a9\u0633 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0646\u062f.\nitself, and, hoping again to be excused, the same deputation again appeared at Court and made a similar representation. Then it became apparent to all the world that the people of Lamgh\u00e1n were in the wrong. So the minister turned the petition over and wrote on the back of it: \"Al-khar\u00e1ju khur\u00e1j\", add'uhu daud'uhu,\" that is to say, \"The tax is a running sore: its cure is its discharge.\" And from the time of this great statesman this saying has become proverbial, and has proved useful in many cases. May the earth rest lightly on this great man!\n\nAnecdote vii.\n\nThere were great statesmen under the 'Abb\u00e1sid dynasty, and indeed the history of the Barmecides is well known and famous, and to what extent were their gifts and rewards. [Ibn] Sahl, called Dhu'r-Riy\u00e1satayn\u00b9 (\"the lord of two commands\"), and his brother Fadl were exalted above the very heavens, so much so that Ma'm\u00fan espoused Fadl's daughter and asked her in marriage. Now she was a damsel peerless in beauty and unrivalled in attainments; and it was agreed that Ma'm\u00fan should go to the bride's house and remain there for a month, and after the lapse of this period return home with the bride. On the day fixed for their departure he desired, as is customary, to array himself in better clothes. Now Ma'm\u00fan always wore black; and people supposed that he wore it because black was the distinctive colour of the 'Abb\u00e1sids: till one day Yahy\u00e1 b. Aktham\u00b2 inquired of him, \"Why is it that the Prince of Believers prefers black garments?\" Ma'm\u00fan replied to the Judge: \"Black garments are for man and for the living; for no woman is married in black, nor is any dead\n\n\u00b9 There appears to be a confusion here between the two brothers. Hasan ibn Sahl was the father of P\u00far\u00e1n, al-Ma'm\u00fan's bride, while Fadl bore the title of Dhu'r-Riy\u00e1satayn. See De Slane's Ibn Khallik\u00e1n, vol. i, pp. 268-272 and 408-409; vol. ii, pp. 472-476. Also the La\u1e6d\u1e0d'if\u016b'l-Ma'drif of ath-Tha'\u0101libi (ed. De Jong), pp. 73, 74, where a full account is given of this marriage.\n\n\u00b2 See De Slane's Ibn Khallik\u00e1n, iv, pp. 33-51.\nman buried in black.\" Yahy\u00e1 was greatly surprised by this answer. So on this day Ma'm\u00fan desired to inspect the wardrobe; but of a thousand coats of satin, of royal fabric, of fur, hand-woven, of various colours, hand-cut, of fine black silk,\u00b9 he neither approved nor accepted one, but clad himself in his customary black, and mounted, and turned his face towards the bride's house. Now on that day Fa\u1e0dl had decked out his palace in such wise that the nobles were filled with wonder thereat, for he had collected so many rare things that words would fail to describe or enumerate them. So when Ma'm\u00fan reached the gate of this palace, he saw a curtain suspended, fairer than a Chinese spring, and more delightful than the assurance of faith, whereof the design charmed the heart and the colour mingled with the soul; and he said to himself: \"Whichever of those thousand coats I had chosen, I should have been shamed here. Praise be to God and thanks that I was content with this black raiment.\"\n\nNow of all the elaborate preparations made by Fa\u1e0dl on that day, one was this, that when Ma'm\u00fan reached the middle of the palace yard, he saw a tray filled with wax, round which was arranged a pattern of pearls.\u00b2 And at the feet of each guest were cast several nuts, in each of which was a piece of paper whereon was inscribed the name of a village; and whoever drew one, to him were delivered the title-deeds of that village.\n\nSo when Ma'm\u00fan entered the bride's house, he saw a mansion faced with gypsum and adorned with paintings.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 The exact nature of most of these fabrics I have been unable to ascertain. The list runs as follows: \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0633 \u0648 \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0649 \u0648 \u0646\u0633\u064a\u062c [\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642] \u0648 \u0646\u0633\u064a\u062c \u0648 [A., B., \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c \u0648 \u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0648 \u0627\u0643\u0633\u0646]\n\n\u00b2 This sentence is not quite clear.

He saw, moreover, cast down and spread out at the entrance of the house, mats of cloth of gold,\\(^1\\) embroidered with rubies, pearls, and turquoises; and in like manner six cushions placed thereon, on which was seated a beauteous damsel sweeter than existence and life, and pleasanter than health and youth; in stature such that the noble cypress would have subscribed itself her servant; with cheeks which the brightest sun would have acknowledged as suzerain; with hair which was the envy of musk and ambergris; and with eyes after the likeness of the onyx and the narcissus.\\(^2\\) She, rising to her feet, advanced towards Ma'm\u00fan, with a profound obeisance and earnest apologies, brought him forward and seated him in the chief seat, and stood before him in service. Ma'm\u00fan bade her be seated, whereupon she seated herself on her knees,\\(^3\\) hanging her head and looking down at the carpet. Thereupon Ma'm\u00fan was overcome with love: he had already lost his heart, and now he would have added thereunto his very soul. He stretched out his hand and drew forth from the pocket of his coat eighteen pearls, each one as large as a sparrow's egg, brighter than the stars of heaven, more lustrous than the teeth of the fair, rounder, nay, more luminous, than Jupiter or Saturn. These rolled on the surface of the carpet, and, by reason of its smoothness and their roundness, continued in motion, there being no cause for their quiescence. But the girl paid no heed to the pearls, nor so much as raised her head. Thereat was Ma'm\u00fan's passion further increased, and he extended\n\n\\(^1\\) This sentence, again, is not clear.

But this caress aroused her modesty and covered her with confusion, and the delicate damsel was so affected that she was overtaken by that state peculiar to women, and the marks of shame and abashed modesty appeared in her cheeks and countenance, and she suddenly exclaimed: \"O Prince of Believers! The command of God cometh, seek not then to hasten it!\"\u00b9\n\nThereat Ma'm\u00fan withdrew his hand, and was near swooning on account of the extreme beauty of this citation, and her graceful application of it. Yet still he could not take his eyes off her, and for eighteen days he came not forth from this house and concerned himself with naught save two occupations.

But when Alptag\u00edn saw a clear field, he turned his hand to oppression, and began to levy contributions on Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1.

The G\u00far Kh\u00e1n, after the way of good Muslims, wrote a letter in Persian to Alptag\u00edn as follows:\n\n\"In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Clement.

They craved a delay of four months; which period dragged on with all sorts of detriments, the least of which was the disbursements from the treasury for the salaries of the ambassadors and the maintenance of the Im\u00e1ms, until at length Mu\u1e25ammad b. \u2018Abdu\u2019ll\u00e1h the scribe, who was Bughr\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n\u2019s private secretary, and was deeply versed in learning and highly distinguished in scholarship, besides being one of the most eloquent stylists amongst the Muslims both in prose and verse, said: \u201cI will answer these questions in two words, in such wise that when the greatest scholars and most conspicuous men of al-Isl\u00e1m shall see my answer, it shall command their approval and admiration.\u201d So he took up his pen and wrote under the questions, after the fashion of a legal decision (fatw\u00e1): \u201cSaith God\u2019s Apostle (upon whom be the Blessing of God, and also on his Family), \u2018Reverence for God\u2019s command and loving-kindness towards God\u2019s people.\u2019\u201d All the Im\u00e1ms of Transoxania bit their fingers in amazement and expressed their admiration, saying, \u201cHere indeed is an answer which is perfect, and an answer which is comprehensive!\u201d And the Kh\u00e1q\u00e1n was greatly pleased because the difficulty had been overcome by a scribe and not left to the divines. And when the answer reached Ghazna, all applauded it.\n\nIt therefore results from these premises that an intelligent and accomplished Secretary is a great ornament to the brilliance of a King\u2019s Court. And with this anecdote we conclude this chapter. And from God cometh assistance.\n\nSecond Discourse.\n\nOn the Nature of Poetry, and the Utility of the Skilful Poet.\n\nPoetry is that art whereby the poet arranges imaginary propositions, and adapts the deductions, with the result that he can make a little thing appear great and a great thing small, or worse good to appear in the garb of evil and evil in the garb of good. By acting on the imagination,\nhe excites the faculties of anger and concupiscence in such a way that by his suggestion men's temperaments become affected with exultation or depression; whereby he conduces to the accomplishment of great things in the order of the world.\n\nAnecdote xii.\n\nThus they relate that Ahmad b. 'Abdu'llah al-Khujist\u00e1n\u00ed\u00b9 was asked, \"How didst thou, who wert originally an ass-herd, become Amir of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n?\" He replied: \"One day I was reading the D\u00edv\u00e1n of \u1e24andhala of B\u0101dg\u012bs,\u00b2 in B\u0101dg\u012bs of Khujist\u00e1n, when I chanced on these two couplets:\n\n\u0645\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 \u0643\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u0634\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e \u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064f\u060c \u0634\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u062e\u064e\u0637\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0632\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0652 \u0634\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e \u0628\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0648\u064e\u064a\u0652\u060c\n\u064a\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0631\u064e\u06af\u064e\u064a \u0648\u064e \u0646\u064e\u0627\u0632\u064e \u0648\u064e \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062a\u064e \u0648\u064e \u062c\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u060c \u064a\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e\u06af\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u064a\u0652.\n\n'If lordship lies within the lion's jaws,\nGo, risk it, and from those dread portals seize\nSuch straight-confronting death as men desire,\nOr riches, greatness, rank and lasting ease.'\n\nAn impulse stirred within me such that I could in no wise remain content with that condition wherein I was. I therefore sold my asses, bought a horse, and, quitting my country, entered the service of 'Amr b. Layth.\u00b3 At that time the fortune of the \u0160aff\u0101ris still floated at the zenith of its prosperity.

When I reached Kar\u016bkh, I produced my warrant, and what was paid to me I divided amongst the army and gave to the soldiers. My horsemen now numbered three hundred.\n\nWhen I reached Khw\u0101lid, and again produced my warrant, the burghees of Khw\u0101lid contested it, saying, 'Do we want a magistrate with [a bodyguard of only] ten men?' I thereupon decided to renounce my allegiance to the Sufis, visited Khw\u0101lid, proceeded to the village of Yashb, and came to Bayhaq, where two thousand horsemen joined me. I advanced and took Nish\u0101p\u016br, and my affairs prospered and improved until all Khur\u0101s\u0101n lay open to me, and I took possession of it for myself. Of all this, these two verses of poetry were the cause.\"\n\nSulaiman relates in his history that the affairs of Ahmad b. \u1e24asan that prospered so greatly that in one night at Nish\u0101p\u016br he distributed a largesse 300,000 dinars, 500 camels, a house, and 100 suits of clothes, and today he\n\n---\n\nThe numbers are both very doubtful.

And the poet must be of pleasing conversation in social gatherings, of cheerful countenance on festive occasions; and his verse must have attained to such a level that it is written on the page of Time and celebrated on the lips and tongues of the noble, and be such that they transcribe it in books and recite it in cities. For the richest portion and most excellent part of poetry is immortal fame, and until it be thus confirmed and published it is ineffectual to this end, and this result cannot accrue from it; it will not survive its author, and, being ineffectual for the immortalizing of his name, how can it confer immortality on another?\n\nBut to this rank a poet cannot attain unless in the prime of his life and the season of his youth he commits to memory\n20,000 couplets of the poetry of the Ancients and 10,000 verses of the works of the Moderns, holds them constantly before his eyes, and continually reads and marks the *diwans* of the masters of his art, observing how they have acquitted themselves in the strait passes and delicate places of song, in order that thus the fashion and varieties of verse may become ingrained in his nature, and the defects and beauties of poetry may be inscribed on the tablet of his understanding. In this way his style will improve and his genius will develop. Then, when his taste has been formed by wide reading of poetry, and his style of expression is thus strengthened, let him address himself seriously to the poetic art, study the science of Prosody, and peruse the works of Master Abu'l-Hasan Bahr\u0101m\u012b of Sarakhs, such as the \"Goal of Prosodists\" (*Ghayatul-'Ar\u016b\u1e0diyyin*), the \"Thesaurus of Rhyme\" (*Kanzu'l-Q\u00e1f\u012bya*), and the works treating of poetic ideas and phraseology, plagiarisms, biographies, and all the sciences of this class, with such a master as he deemeth best, that thus he in turn may come to merit the title of Master, that his name may remain on the page of time like the names of those other Masters which we have mentioned, and that he may be able to discharge his debt to his patron and lord for what he obtains from him, so that his name may endure for ever.\n\nNow it behoves the King to patronize such a person, so that he may remain in his service and celebrate his praise. But if he fall below this level, he should waste no money on him and pay no heed to his poetry, especially if he be old; for I have investigated this matter, and in the whole world have found nothing worse than an old poet, nor any money more ill spent than what is given to such. For one so ignoble as not to have discovered in fifty years that what he writes is bad, when will he discover it? But if he be young and has the right talent, even though his verse be not good, there is some hope that it may improve, and according to the Law of Chivalry it is proper to patronize him, a duty to take care of him, and an obligation to maintain him.\nNow in the service of kings naught is better than improvisation, for thereby the king's mood is cheered, his receptions are made brilliant, and the poet himself attains his object. Such favours as R\u00fadag\u00ed obtained from the House of S\u00e1m\u00e1n by his improvisations and by virtue of his verse, none other hath experienced.\n\n(To be continued.)\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. Hum\u0101y\u016bn's Inscription at J\u0101m.\n\nShottermill.\nApril 7, 1899.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014It may interest the readers of our Journal to know that the inscription from Turbat-i-J\u0101m, which was sent by the lamented Mr. Ney Elias and published in the Journal for January, 1897, is referred to by the author of the M\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Rah\u012bm\u012b, who was a native of Persia and wrote early in the seventeenth century. He says (M.S., A.S.B., 284a) that he had read the inscription and noticed the blessed handwriting of the Emperor, but that the exact words of the verse had not remained in his memory. This statement occurs in his life of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n.\n\nH. Beveridge.\n\n2. Balonga, the Oldest Capital of Champa.\n\nDear Professor Rhys Davids,\u2014When the first part of Captain Gerini's paper on the \"Early Geography of Indo-China\" appeared (now nearly two years ago) I was much struck by one of his identifications of Ptolemy's place-names, which seemed to me both to corroborate strongly the general correctness of the method employed, and to be in itself of some intrinsic interest. After awaiting, with much curious expectation, but in vain, the continuation\nThe name is a place nearly half-way up the river.\n\nIn a paper entitled *Les Tchames* (1893), it is stated that they were brought from India by the Chinese and the presence of Champa was reported in the north, before being driven out by the armies of the Celestial Empire and the Annamites and the Chinese. The last descendants of this race, who are now called the Chams, have preserved the tradition of three cities. The first city is *Shri-Banau*, located near Quang-Binh. The second city is *Hue*, near Hu\u00e9, the third city is *Balang*. These cities are now preserved in the province of Quang-Ninh.\n\nThe city of *Balang* appears to have been named after Ptolemy's *Baling*.\nwere driven from their northern provinces. This fact illustrates M. Aymonier's statement that the Cham civilization originally advanced from the south northwards, and long afterwards was driven back towards the south again, till in the end it was practically annihilated by the Annamese.\n\nMoreover, it is evident that Indian influences had already in Ptolemy's time struck root in Indo-China, and that the Indian names he gives to places on that coast are not all merely due to the nomenclature of casual Indian traders and seafarers. For *bal* is the Cham for 'palace, capital, seat of royalty,' and no doubt corresponds with the Malay *balei*, which, according to Favre, represents the Sanskrit *valaya*, 'enclosure.' A *capital*, with a name that is specifically Cham, but appears to be derived in part from Sanskrit, implies something of the nature of a local organized government borrowing, as the Cham civilization throughout its ascertained history certainly did borrow, a good deal from Indian sources. Thus Ptolemy's short entry of *Balonga, metropolis*, which antedates the evidence of the local inscriptions by at least a century or two, has preserved for us what is probably the oldest scrap of authentic Indo-Chinese history on record.\u2014I am, etc.,\n\nC. Otto Blagden.\n\n3. *Mramma* (\u1019\u1030\u1019).\n\nThis is the classical name of the people whom we call Burmese and the country which is commonly called Burma, from the colloquial pronunciation B\u0101m\u0101.\n\nThe word Mramma, though spelt with *r*, is properly pronounced as if spelt with *y*, and B\u0101m\u0101 is easily deducible from Myamm\u0101, though Brahm\u0101 cannot be turned into Mramma. Notwithstanding this, Sir Arthur Phayre and others have held that Mramma is a modern appellation, the outcome of the national pride. Sir Arthur, at p. 2 of his History, says: \"the Indian settlers gave to them and adopted themselves the name Brahm\u0101, which is that used\nin Buddhist sacred books for the first inhabitants of the world . . . . This term, when used to designate the existing people, is now written Mramm\u0101 and generally pronounced Bam\u0101.\"\n\nAs I have stated above, the language naturally lends itself to this change, as tan-myet to tabyet, a broom. Other instances might be given. Brahman\u0101 and Brahm\u0101 constantly appear in Burmese books, but are not changed in spelling or pronunciation, and no one has yet adduced any proof to show that this change was made when using the word Brahm\u0101 to designate the people, if such really was the case.\n\nThe Burmese have been called by the Chinese Mien and by the Shans and others Man. In poetry their country is always the country of Mran or Myan, and I think we may safely conclude that this was the original name of the race or tribe.\n\nWhy, then, is it now called Mramm\u0101? The answer appears to me to be perfectly simple. The original name of the tribe was Mran, which is written with a simple nasal final which can be represented by n or m. When the monks wrote this name in classical Pali it became Marammo, plural Maramm\u0101 (see Childers' Dictionary, Kaly\u0101ni Inscriptions of A.D. 1476, and the S\u0101sanavamsa of Pa\u00f1\u00f1as\u0101mi), which in the Burmese character would be \u1019\u101b\u1019\u102e Mramm\u0101, colloquially Bam\u0101.\u00b9 Mr. Taw-sein-ko has lately made a statement that the word is connected with Prome (Brome) on the Irrawaddy, a town whose name he derives from Brahm. These conjectures and statements all require a certain amount of evidence, without which they are valueless and misleading.\n\nIt is no use to ask a Burmese for a derivation if you want the correct one. He is always for \"lucus a non lucendo.\"\n\nR. F. St. Andrew St. John.\n\nWadham College, Oxford.\n\nMay 4, 1899.\n\n\u00b9 The fact that the Pali word has two m's militates against the Brahm\u0101 theory.\n4. Ari.\n\nSecretariat, Rangoon.\n\nApril 26, 1899.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I have read with interest Mr. St. John\u2019s letter on the word \u2018Ari\u2019 in the Society\u2019s Journal for January, 1899. Mrs. Bode suggests that the word may be connected with the P\u0101li word *ariyo*, while Mr. St. John feels sure that it stands for *ara\u00f1\u00f1aka* or *ara\u00f1\u00f1ako*, \u2018one who dwells in the forest.\u2019 I have consulted a number of pandits, and they all confirm Mrs. Bode\u2019s derivation. They tell me that \u1021\u101b\u103e\u1031\u1037 becomes \u1021\u101b\u103e\u1031\u1037 in Burmese in the same way as \u1016\u103b\u1004\u103a becomes \u1016\u103b\u1004\u103a and \u1016\u103b\u1004\u103a becomes \u1016\u103b\u1004\u103a, and that in Burmese literature the word \u1021\u101b\u103e\u1031\u1037 has the meaning of \u2018noble, excellent,\u2019 when used as an adjective. A number of extracts have been shown me to support the latter portion of their statement.\n\nBurmese history and Burmese archaeology are almost a terra incognita in Europe. The field is large, but the labourers are few. However, an Archaeological Department and a Provincial Museum are soon to be established in Burma, and it is hoped that the darkness, which now enshrouds things Burmese, will soon be dispelled.\u2014Yours very truly,\n\nTaw Sein Ko.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, London.\n\n5. Persian Manuscript attributed to Fakhrud\u012bn R\u0101z\u012b, with a Note on Ris\u0101latu \u2019l Gh\u016bfr\u0101n by Ab\u016b \u2019l \u2019Al\u0101 al-Ma\u2019arr\u012b and other MSS. in the same Collection.\n\nTrinity College, Cambridge.\n\nMay 17, 1899.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I was much interested to learn from Dr. Horn\u2019s letter that a copy of the Persian MS.,\nwhich I described in the January number, is catalogued in the Aya Sofia at Constantinople under the title of \u062d\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u062b\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062f\u0650. This seems to put R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s authorship beyond question. As regards his originality, perhaps I expressed myself rather carelessly when I said that my MS. had \u201cevery appearance of being an original work.\u201d As the context shows, I meant to say that in my opinion it was not translated from the Greek, and could so far claim to be an original composition. I never doubted that it was largely compiled from other sources: this was a priori to be expected, and in many cases R\u0101z\u012b actually cites his authority. While I am not prepared to assert positively that he was indebted to the \u0646\u064e\u062e\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0631\u064f \u062e\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0632\u0652\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651, a perusal of Dr. Horn\u2019s paper has convinced me that the two works, although similar in scope, are yet to a large extent arranged in parallel lines. It is curious that I should have unnecessarily attacked Dr. Horn\u2019s admirable suggestion to identify the authority whom R\u0101z\u012b cites by the name \u0646\u064e\u062e\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0631\u064f \u062e\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0632\u0652\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 with Ism\u0101\u02bfil b. \u1e24asan b. \u1e24amad al-Husaini al-Jurj\u0101n\u012b, author of the \u0646\u064e\u062e\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0631\u064f \u062e\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0632\u0652\u0645\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651 or Al-Sharif Sharafuddin Ism\u0101\u02bfil, to whom R\u0101z\u012b might be referring, is in fact the same (see Persian Catalogue, p. 467; Ibn Abi Us\u0101ibia, vol. ii, p. 31 seq.).\n\nIn writing my article on the \u062d\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0638\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0635\u064e\u0651\u062d\u0650\u064a\u062d\u0650, I have had occasion to make for my own use a rough catalogue of the Arabic and Persian MSS. gathered many years ago by the late Dr. John Nicholson of Penrith. The casual owner of MSS. may not improperly be likened to an innocent receiver of stolen goods, whose best apology is unwillingness to publish what has befallen him. I hope therefore to be pardoned if I give some slight account of the more valuable and notice briefly a few more which have escaped from rarity.\n\nThe Persian MSS., both in number and quality, are much inferior to the Arabic. Besides the \u1e24if\u1e93u \u2019l Sihha I need\nonly mention the Tuhfatu 'l M\u016b'min\u012bn, the Tuhfa-i S\u0101m\u012b, the Khamsa of Niz\u0101m\u012b, J\u0101m\u012b's D\u012bv\u0101n (two copies), and an exquisitely written Kulliy\u0101ti Amir Khusrau, which belonged in turn to the libraries of Dr. Adam Clarke and Miss Richardson Currer.\n\nThere are about 150 Arabic MSS., and to one of these, the Ris\u0101latu 'l Gh\u016bfr\u0101n, I would call special attention, because it is, as I believe, a genuine work, hitherto unknown and undescribed, of the famous blind poet and man of letters, Ab\u016b 'l 'Al\u0101 al-Ma'arri. The title runs:\n\n\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0623\u0644\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0646\u062c\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0649 \u0648\u0631\u0633\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0635\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0628\u062d\u0644\u0628\n\nA work entitled Ris\u0101la al-Gh\u016bfr\u0101n occurs in H\u0101ji Khalifa (vol. iii, p. 422), but it has no connection with my MS. I think, however, that H\u0101ji Khalifa does mention this Ris\u0101la in the passage (vol. iii, p. 459) where he describes the Ras\u0101'il of Ab\u016b 'l 'Al\u0101 in the following terms:\n\n\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0627\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0621... \u0648\u0647\u064a \u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0629 \u0627\u0642\u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0637\u0648\u0627\u0644 \u062c\u0631\u0649 \u0645\u062c\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0646\u0641\u0629 \u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0630\u0643\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0639\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0636 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\n\nFor the words \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0639\u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646 read \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0631\u0641\u0627\u0646\u2014a very easy change. The MS. now before me fully answers to H\u0101ji Khalifa's description, that is to say, it is really a rhetorical composition, which cannot save in courtesy be styled an Epistle. It extends to 219 pages in all. The first and longer portion consists of a series of imaginary conversations between the Shaikh 'Al\u012b b. Mans\u016br and poets of the Ignorance who have been forgiven (hence the title) and received into Paradise. Many verses are quoted and commented on, each poet explaining and defending his own, and various amusing incidents are introduced. The second part deals mainly with heresies and heretics, e.g. \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0646\u0627\u062f\u0642\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0647\u0631\u062a\u0648\u0646. As I hope to print some extracts from the Ris\u0101latu 'l Gh\u016bfr\u0101n in an early issue of the Journal,\nI refrain from giving further details just now. It appears to me to have great interest, not only as a new and probably unique specimen of Ab\u016b 'l 'Al\u0101's literary powers, but also as being in itself a noteworthy accession to the huge mass of writings which fall under the general head of 'adab' or 'Litterae Humaniores.' The date is not formally stated, but we may infer from a passage on p. 156 that the Ris\u0101la was composed in 414 A.H.\n\nPoetry and Commentaries thereon.\n\n(1) Tanw\u012br\u016b 'l Siq\u1e6d, containing the text of Ab\u016b 'l 'Al\u0101's Siq\u1e6du 'l Zand with an excellent commentary called Tanw\u012br\u016b 'l Zand. This commentary is mentioned by H\u0101j\u012b Khal\u012bfa (vol. iii, p. 601), who says that it incorporates with many enlargements and corrections the commentary which Ab\u016b 'l 'Al\u0101 himself dictated, and which was called Dau'u 'l Siq\u1e6d. The author of this commentary is not known; H\u0101j\u012b Khal\u012bfa says \u064a\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064f. An ancient hand has ascribed it on the title-page to the Im\u0101m Fakhru'dd\u012bn R\u0101z\u012b. R\u0101z\u012b did indeed compose a commentary on this Div\u0101n, but Ibn Ab\u012b Us\u0101biya (ed. A. M\u00fcller, vol. ii, p. 29, fifth line from the foot) declares that it was left unfinished, which is clearly not the case here. Moreover, R\u0101z\u012b was born in 543 A.H., two years after the date of this work (541 A.H.). This copy was written in the year 709 A.H., \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0647\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0629\u060c in the city of J\u0101jarm in Khor\u0101s\u0101n. My MS. is undoubtedly identical with the commentary which De Sacy mentions in his Chrestomathy (vol. iii, p. 92) and cites as 124 R.\n\n(2) Shar\u1e25u Tarjum\u0101ni 'l Ashw\u0101q. This MS. contains a Div\u0101n by the celebrated Mu\u1e25iyyu'dd\u012bn b. al-'Arab\u012b, entitled \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u0648\u0627\u0642, with the author's own commentary, which is here called \u0627\u0644\u062f\u062e\u0627\u0626\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0644\u0642 (see H\u0101j\u012b Khal., vol. ii, p. 276). It has the preface (quoted in the Leyden Catalogue, vol. ii, p. 74 seq.) giving the date of the author's arrival in Mecca as 598 A.H., not 611 A.H. as is stated by H\u0101j\u012b Khal\u012bfa, and begins with the same doxology, viz. \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0639\u0627\u0644. It would be interesting to know\nwhether the text of the poems in this MS. agrees with that in the Leyden MS. (No. 596) and the Gotha MS. (No. 2,268); and I hope to investigate this point at the first opportunity.

(Lisboa: Imprensa Nacional, 1898.)\n\nIn 1833 there was published, as one of the volumes printed for the Oriental Translation Fund, the \"Tohfut-ul-Mujahideen, an Historical work in the Arabic Language. Translated into English by Lieut. M. J. Rowlandson, Cor. M.R.A.S., Persian Interpreter to the Head-quarters of the Army, Fort St. George.\" The work of which this is a translation is by Zain-ud D\u012bn, a writer who lived during the reign of Ali Adil Sh\u0101h, the fifth sovereign of the Adil Sh\u0101hi dynasty at Bij\u0101pur, and gives a history of Malabar, especially during the Portuguese period down to 1586. The importance and accuracy of this work have been recognized by all writers on Indian history; and Rowlandson's translation has been often quoted. Unfortunately, however, his translation is in many places inaccurate, and his rendering of proper names is often erroneous. The late Sir Henry Yule, in the List of Books prefixed to his Hobson-Jobson, inserts after the title of Rowlandson's work the remark, \"Very badly edited\"; and after a quotation from it, s.v. 'Capucat,' he adds: \"The want of editing in this last book is deplorable.\" A new translation properly edited was therefore a great desideratum; and such has now appeared in Lisbon, in connection with the fourth centenary of the discovery of India by Vasco da Gama. Mr. David Lopes, the translator and editor, has collated four MSS.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\ncourses were attended by 166 students; and two special courses of lectures on Russian and Spanish, specially designed to suit the requirements of commercial men, were attended by 199 other students. On the completion of their course of studies various students, whose names are given, received diplomas for knowledge of Chinese, Japanese, and Swaheli. And accounts are given of a legacy bequeathed to the school, and of collections of Moorish and Arabic and Persian MSS. presented to it.\n\nThe object of the present publications is stated to be: (1) To follow up the latest developments of the languages taught in the College, and of their allied idioms; (2) to help towards an all-round progress in the scientific knowledge of those languages, and especially in fields so far insufficiently explored; (3) to work up old and to open out new ground in the interests of the commerce, the foreign missions, and the colonies of Germany; and (4) to devote a careful study, in connection with all the above objects, to the literatures, habits and customs, religions, laws, institutions, and the historical and economic development of the peoples who speak the above-mentioned languages.\n\nThe scheme may seem ambitious, splendidly ambitious. But it is not running much risk to say that under the guidance of Geheimrath Sachau and his able coadjutors it has every likelihood of a great success, and the present volumes are fully worthy of the high standard thus set up.\n\nWe have here a series of monographs by the most competent hands on an Arabic chronicle from Zanzibar, on the present movement among Turkish writers towards a greater purity of diction; on a story from Oman; on the present state of legal studies and institutions in Turkey; on inscriptions from Syria; on Russian works on Western Asia; on the language of Galicia; on metre in modern Arabic; on proverbs current in Morocco; on a journey from Pekin to Chang-an and Lo-yang; on the position of women in Japan; on the modern history of Japan; and on Russian works on the far East; on\nMuhammadan law as administered in East Africa; on law and custom among the Bantus; on fruit production in Zanzibar (from native sources); on the numerals in five Bantu dialects; on the dialect of Gulf Speke; and on East-African place-names.\n\nWhen we see such studies, thorough and scholarly of course\u2014for are they not the work of teachers attached to a German University?\u2014but yet carefully chosen with a view to practical acquaintance with the peoples lately brought under German influence, and within the reach of German trade, we may begin to understand one of the advantages that trade enjoys. And we may ask whether the time has not come for England, also, to make up for lost time by establishing a similar school, and by encouraging Englishmen thrown into contact with Eastern and African peoples to give up their habit of learning at second-hand, and of conversing only through interpreters.\n\nThe G\u0101taka (= J\u0101taka) M\u0101l\u0101, or Garland of Birth-stories. By \u0100rya S\u016bra. Translated from the Sanskrit by J. S. Speyer. (London: Frowde, 1895.)\n\nThis forms the first volume of a series of \"Sacred Books of the Buddhists,\" edited by Professor Max M\u00fcller. He states in the preface that when the series of \"Sacred Books of the East\" had closed, he still continued to receive offers of translations of important texts. They were chiefly Buddhist texts, and the King of Siam having promised material support, the present series was started. In thus providing the necessary means for the publishing of this volume the King of Siam has afforded a fresh proof of his enlightened patronage of literature, already well known by his support of the Pali Text Society, by the magnificent edition he has had printed of the Buddhist canonical works, and by his projected edition of the chief commentaries upon them. The cordial thanks of the increasing numbers of those interested in the comparative study of religion and\nphilosophy, of those interested in the history of India, and especially of those interested in Buddhism, are due to His Majesty for this fresh proof of his munificence.\n\nThe work itself is a small collection of old stories, originally current in Prakrit, and here retold in good orthodox Sanskrit by the author, whom the editor, Professor Kern, assigns to the seventh century A.D., and the translator, Dr. Speyer, thinks may be a century or two older. Now and again the learned author, \u0100rya S\u016bra, has misunderstood some word in his Prakrit original (see, for instance, Kern\u2019s notes on pp. 88, 113) and thus makes a mistake which clearly shows the method of his work. As his date is about a thousand years, more or less, after the Buddha, the work bears about the same relation to the Buddhist canonical books as a work of some mediaeval monk who retold the New Testament parables in a greatly amplified version would bear to the New Testament itself. It is good evidence of the literary ability of \u0100rya S\u016bra, of the style current at his time, and even, to a slight degree (in the additions made by the author), of beliefs held at the time and place when and where it was composed. Of especial value in this respect are the half-dozen references to older S\u016btras as authoritative documents, and the fact that the work is exclusively Hinay\u0101na, not Mah\u0101y\u0101na, is evidence of the still continued popularity of the older Buddhism at a comparatively late date.\n\nThere is very little, however, that is distinctively Buddhist in this work. The doctrines of previous births, and of the effect worked in this birth by a man\u2019s deeds in his previous births, are no doubt Buddhist; but they are also both pre-Buddhist, and common to other Indian systems of thought. And the sort of simple ethics inculcated is common ground not only to Buddhist, but to Indian, and indeed very much also to all, tellers of fables. We could wish therefore that subsequent volumes of this series might be chosen from the canonical books, or at least from books dealing with philosophic and religious conceptions.\n\nThe present volume is very readable. The excellent\nEnglish of the translations, and the careful and scholarly introduction, reflect the greatest credit on the translator. And we hope that the well-known organizing ability of Professor Max M\u00fcller, who has prefixed an interesting introduction of his own, will meet with as much success in the excellent idea of this series as it has already done in the case of the \"Sacred Books of the East.\"\n\nThe Preaching of Isl\u0101m: a History of the Propagation of the Muslim Faith. By T. W. Arnold, B.A. 8vo; pp. 388. (Westminster: Constable & Co.)\n\nAn account of the ways and means adopted by the disciples of Isl\u0101m to propagate their belief throughout the world should be of great interest and importance. Not many have a clear notion of the real extent of the followers of the Muslim Church, much less are they acquainted with the manner in which they took root in countries of quite heterogeneous races. That from the outset Isl\u0101m exercised missionary powers was due to the force of circumstances. In viewing this point one must start from the idea that it came to aid the spread of monotheism among pagans, and it is chiefly in countries inhabited by such that Isl\u0101m has obtained a lasting foothold. This is sufficient to secure it the character of a universal religion, although so extensive a programme, as the author makes the founder of Isl\u0101m responsible for, was not anticipated in the original scheme. Mr. Arnold goes too far when he asserts that Muhammed in the initial stages of his ministry claimed to have a mission to all mankind (p. 24). He certainly does not upset Sir William Muir's theory that the universalistic idea in Isl\u0101m was only an afterthought. The words of the Qor\u0101n upon which Mr. Arnold bases his argument (S\u016bra xvi, 86) do not extend beyond the Jews and Christians of the Arab peninsula. Even when Muhammed's temporal power was on the increase, his energies were in the main directed towards his immediate neighbourhood, and he bequeathed\nto his successors the very arduous task of strengthening the bonds which held many indifferent members to the mother church.\n\nMr. Arnold's views on the methods preached by Muhammed are altogether too ideal. All was not so pure and inoffensive as he seems to think. The passages he quotes in support of his theory that the Qor\u0101n \"forbids violence and force in the conversion of unbelievers\" should not have been selected without a look into the circumstances under which they were revealed. No one will be astonished to hear Muhammed proclaim patience as a great virtue or recommend gentle methods of persuasion during the Meccan period, when his cause was weak and his personal safety endangered. How different is his attitude after the conquest of Mecca, when in a bold manifesto he \"in the name of All\u0101h\" repudiates treaties existing between him and unbelievers: \"When the sacred months have passed away, kill the idolaters wherever you may find them; and take them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in every place of observation\" (ix, 5) . . . . \"Fight those who believe not in All\u0101h and the last day,\" etc. (ibid., s. 29). We have only quoted the most striking passages, but there are many more, indeed, during the whole of Muhammed's life in Medina, and sword and dagger are more prominent than is compatible with a peaceful spread of Isl\u0101m. A history of Muhammed's mission cannot be written without taking into account the forcible measures as well as the peaceful ones which were adopted. Mr. Arnold also omits another of the attractions possessed by early Isl\u0101m, viz. the material gain promised to the converts of the poorer classes. Many who were all but starving when joining the ranks of the Faithful, died rich men.\n\nThe author will find some difficulty in convincing the reader that the mere 'preaching' of Isl\u0101m is identical with the history of its propagation. How about the slaughter of the B. Korei\u1e93a after their surrender? That the wars of Muhammed were not aggressive but defensive is a sweeping assertion, which it would be extremely embarrassing to\nprove. In his account of peaceful conversions Mr. Arnold places too much reliance on traditions more conspicuous by religious bias than good authority. He reproduces, e.g., the story of the conversion of Dhim\u0101m b. Tha'lab\u0101 (the ambassador of the B. Sa'd b. Bakr) according to Sprenger's translation (\"Leben Mohammed's,\" iii, 202), but without sharing this scholar's scepticism as to its historical accuracy. Now it is interesting to compare this account of the matter, which is taken from Ibn Sa'd's large work, with the older version of Ibn Ish\u0101q. According to the latter the conversion did not take place till A. 9 of the Hijra (and not A. 5 as Mr. Arnold believes), and the whole fantastic relation of the event is given on the ill-famed authority of Ibn Abb\u0101s. Now while in Ibn Sa'd's version Dhim\u0101m asks the Prophet if he was not sent by All\u0101h to \"all men,\" Ibn Ish\u0101q has only the words \"to us.\" This shows more clearly than anything that the universalistic tendency in Isl\u0101m was still far from its full development in the second century.\n\nMr. Arnold's theory of the nearly absolute toleration granted by early Moslims to followers of other creeds should also undergo some slight modification. He forgets, for instance, Omar's treatment of the Christians in Najr\u0101n and of the Jews in Khaibar, who were both expelled from their territories in spite of the treaties they held from Muhammed. The harsher treatment allotted to Jews and Christians in later centuries is but a consequence of maxims laid down in the Qor\u0101n. The law admits neither of them as witnesses, because it denies them the character of integrity, a measure derived rather artificially from a phrase in the Qor\u0101n (lxv, 2, \"Bring as witnesses men of equity from among you\"; cf. Sachau, \"Muhammed. Recht,\" p. 739). Religious tolerance, wherever found among Moslims, is perhaps a question of rare or inborn qualities rather than anything else, just as the intensity of religious feeling varies among the different nations of the Muhammedan creed. At any rate, no general rule can be laid down in this respect; on the contrary, the course of history, even\nin our century, is far from bearing out Mr. Arnold's optimistic opinions.\n\nOtherwise Mr. Arnold has spared no pains in sketching out, both geographically and historically, the wanderings of Isl\u0101m over Western Asia and Europe, Central Asia, India, China, Africa, and the Malay Archipelago. This list of names alone is sufficient to show that Isl\u0101m is by no means dying. In his retrospect of the causes which make it a missionary religion the author, although not giving many new ideas, is yet on the right track. The extreme simplicity of the fundamental tenets, which tax the mind of the would-be believer very little, was and is no doubt a powerful agent in the promotion of propagandist efforts, particularly when applied against a decaying fetishism. Isl\u0101m to-day probably meets with the same experiences among savage nations as it did in bygone times when its advances were met half-way by the pagans who had lost confidence in their old gods, the present circumstance being only dissimilar in that there are no more the enormous difficulties to overcome which were placed in its way by tribal and personal interests. If Mr. Arnold had done nothing but dispel the false notions which are rife among general readers regarding the vitality of Isl\u0101m, he deserved success, but he has done more by giving a bird's-eye view of the present extent of one of the most interesting general upheavals on record.\n\nH. Hirschfeld.\n\nGenesis des Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, von Joseph Dahlmann, S.J.\n8vo; pp. xxiv + 290. (Berlin: Dames, 1899.)\n\nThis new work by Father Dahlmann has a misleading title. One expects a book setting forth the author's views as to the way in which the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was put together into its present shape. Instead of that, one has a series of replies to the various scholars who do not accept the position, put forward in Father Dahlmann's previous works, that the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata existed, as we have it, before the\nfifth century B.C. Professors Hopkins, Ludwig, Jacobi, and Weber, Drs. Winternitz and L\u00fcders, and last, not least, M. Barth, will find themselves here the subject of very strongly worded criticism. But the reader, acquainted with the other works by the same author, will find little that has not been already stated, over and over again, in them. The best sentences in the present work are the ones on p. 50 and p. 150, where the author promises a detailed statement of what can be gathered from the epic as to law and custom, government, social organization, religion, and philosophy. Such a collection of data will be of the very greatest importance if all the evidence is impartially included; and equally important whether they lead up to the author's conclusion or to that of the many scholars of first rank who hold a view so different from his. The present work does not throw much light on that point. The methods of controversy, even in the ablest hands, are necessarily different from those of original research. And when the controversy is so much expanded by reiterated assertion of the author's solution of the very questions at issue, it is even less instructive than controversies usually are. We shall do well, therefore, to await the very interesting volumes which are promised. It is by them, really, that the gifted author will either stand or fall.\n\nZoroaster, the Prophet of Ancient Iran. By A. V. Williams Jackson. 8vo; pp. 312. (New York: published for the Columbia University Press by the Macmillan Co., 1899.)\n\nDuring the last twenty years considerable progress has been made in correcting and extending our knowledge of the Zoroastrian Scriptures, both Avesta and Pahlavi. In Geldner's edition of the Avesta we have probably an exhaustive revision of the complete texts; and this has been supplemented by Darmesteter's transcripts and partial translations of many surviving Avesta fragments. In the Sacred Books of the East we have eight volumes of English\ntranslations of Avesta and Pahlavi texts; to which we must add Darmesteter's French translation of the Avesta, in three quarto volumes of *Le Mus\u00e9e Guimet*. The Pahlavi scriptures have not been so exhaustively translated, though several texts, previously unknown in Europe, have been examined, and others heard of; so that the probability of any important discovery of unrecorded religious texts in Pahlavi is now very small.\n\nNext in importance to the doctrines of a religion are the life and actions of its founder, and the want of some really trustworthy history has been especially felt in the case of Zarathu\u0161tra (the Zoroaster of classical writers), because the original Avesta and Pahlavi narratives have both been lost. But Professor A. V. Williams Jackson has, at length, supplied what was wanted, partly from old summaries of the Pahlavi narrative, and partly from hints in the Avesta and statements, more or less vague, made by classical and Oriental writers. The result is a book which \"deals with the life and legend of Zoroaster\" in a singularly lucid, interesting, and exhaustive manner.\n\nAfter a short introduction, emphasizing the fact that Zoroaster must have been a really historical personage and not a myth, the book narrates what is recorded about his family history and genealogy, his date and native place, his parents, birth, and childhood, his persecution by the old priesthood, his education and religious preparation, his conference with Ahura Mazda (probably in a vision), his two-years' preaching in vain to the Turanians and Karaps, his conferences with the six Amesaspentas, his temptation by Anra-main-yu, and the first real convert he obtained, in his cousin, after ten years of conferences and preaching. Two years more are requisite for the conversion of Vi\u0161t\u0101sp and that king's family and court, owing to the violent opposition of the Kavis and Karaps, the old sages and priests, whose influence is at length overcome by the personal interference of the archangels Vohuman and Ashavahi\u0161ta, aided by the Propitious Fire.\n\nAfter this conversion of King Vi\u0161t\u0101sp, when Zoroaster\nfifth\nand\nlea-\nvery\nwith\nthat\nthe\none\na.d.\nas\nrel-\nbe\nim-\nle-\nsc\nth\nTo\nno\nw\ni\nthe best evidence is strongly in favour of finding it in the west. The conclusion being that Zoroaster was born somewhere in \u0100d\u0101rbaij\u0101n, between Lake Urumiah and the Caspian; his father's family residing either at Urumiah, \u0160iz, or on the Daryai river; and his mother's family at Rai. Regarding the scenes of his activity, he appears to have had little success in his own country, and his early preaching tours among the Turanians were practically useless, even when made in the south-east region of Sagast\u0101n. He must then have returned by degrees to his native land, as the localities of his later conferences, with the Ames\u0101sp\u0113ntas, may be traced south of the Caspian and in \u0100d\u0101rbaij\u0101n.\n\nWhere he had to seek Vi\u0161t\u0101sp is not stated in any Avesta or Pahlavi text, although Sagast\u0101n is sometimes mentioned as belonging to the Kay\u0101n dynasty. Muhammadan writers are almost unanimous in placing Vi\u0161t\u0101sp's kingdom in Bactria, and his capital at Balkh, which appears to have been founded by his father Lohr\u0101sp (Aurvataspa), who is said to have abdicated and lived there in retirement. Thirty-five years after the conversion of Vi\u0161t\u0101sp, Zoroaster was killed by Turanians at the storming of Balkh, according to Firdausi and other Persian writers. But the Pahlavi tradition, though it gives the name of the assassin, does not mention the locality of the massacre.\n\nSeveral eminent Iranian scholars dispute the claims of Bactria to being the scene of Vi\u0161t\u0101sp's conversion and Zoroaster's death, and advocate those of Media. Professor Jackson has stated the evidence on both sides of the question, but wisely refrains from drawing any positive conclusion which, by hastily accepting the evidence on one side, would reject all that which is offered on the other. It is safer to wait for further discoveries and, in the meantime, this valuable work will supply the reader with very nearly all the known materials for understanding the life and work of Zoroaster, the Zarathu\u0161tra of the Avesta.\n\nIt may be useful to add that two or three names, quoted in the book from Persian works, illustrate the marvellous\ningenuity of Persian scribes in misusing diacritical points, so as to corrupt foreign names. In such cases the reader has only to write the name in Persian characters without the points, and then try all possible combinations of other points, when he will soon discover the original reading of the name.\n\nThus, the place called Darbist, or Zarbi\u0161t, in p. 97, lin. 11 and p. 234, n. 2, is found to be a corruption of Diz-i-nipist, or 'fortress of documents,' which is mentioned in the last chapter of the third book of the Dinkard, in a Pahlavi passage translated in S.B.E., xxxvii, xxxi. Again, the strange Mohed Torru of B\u016bsaw\u0101r\u012b, quoted in p. 202, lin. 26, from the Dahist\u0101n, is evidently Barz\u016b of Naw\u1e63ar\u012b, commonly called Dast\u016br Barz\u016b K\u0101md\u012bn, who was still living in 1870.\n\nAnother Persian name, which has been sadly ill-treated by Arab and Persian scribes, is that of the supreme highpriest of Ard\u0101\u0161\u012br P\u0101p\u016bk\u0101n, which has recently been partially corrected from T\u014dsar into Tansar. In the Arabic text of Mawl\u0101n\u012b's Meadows of Gold (ed. R. de Meynard), vol. ii, p. 151, the best out of five readings of the name is B\u012bs\u0101r, and this becomes Tansar when all the diacritical points are added. But the name is Pahlavi and occurs six times in the Dinkard: thrice it can be read either Tansar or T\u014dsar, and twice the letter n or o is doubled. In the Persian text of Tansar's letter to the king of Tabaristan the name occurs five times, and the n is certainly doubled once. The Persian translator also explains (see Journal Asiatique, 1894, pp. 205, 306) that the owner of the original Pahlavi MS. had noted that the name implied that the highpriest's body was hairy. As the first syllable t\u016bm means 'body' in Pahlavi, and the Pahlavi word for 'hair' is c\u0101rs, we might expect the whole name to be Tanvars; but, to adapt this to the Pahlavi and Persian orthography of the word, we ought to go a step farther and assume that the last two letters have been transposed colloquially, so that the actual name had become Tan\u014ds\u0101r; and this reading would correctly represent the Pahlavi spelling with a double n, because r and n are written alike in Pahlavi. We have the option of reading Tan\u014ds\u0101r,\nas tan, 'the body,' is usually written tan\u014d, but how could this reading be reconciled with the meaning 'hairy body'?\n\nJune, 1899.\n\nE. W. West.\n\nAllgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie. Vol. I,\nPart 2. Philosophie der Upanishads. Von Dr.\nPaul Deussen. 8vo; pp. xii and 368. (Leipzig:\nBrockhaus, 1899. Price 9s.)\n\nIn this volume the Upanishads have the good fortune of being treated by an enthusiastic admirer, whose sympathy with their philosophic position has led him to devote a careful study to the texts in their original language, and who unites to a thorough knowledge of European philosophy a strict training in the rules of historical criticism. Had the work been written by a professor of philology instead of by a professor of philosophy it would, no doubt, have been very different. The passages on which the principal stress is here laid might then have loomed less largely than other passages here passed over as if of little moment. A selection in either case would be inevitable; and what we have here is a complete statement of the Upanishad theory of God and of the soul. To the first, the theology, ten chapters are devoted; to the second, four; and there are supplementary chapters on the views expressed in the Upanishads as to transmigration, salvation, and ethics; and a very interesting introductory discussion of the relative age of the various texts.\n\nThroughout the book the question of the course of the development of the different doctrines discussed is kept constantly before the reader's attention. And in this respect the views put forward by the author are characterized by so much caution, and at the same time by so much insight, and supported by so many details, that they will probably be accepted, in the main, by all future writers on the subject. The conclusions reached are a distinct contribution to our knowledge of the question; and it will be advisable, shortly, to set out the final result.\nThe oldest of the Upanishads, which are also the longest and are in prose, consist, each of them, of a mosaic of passages different in age and origin. It is only possible, therefore, in a very general way, and subject to special reservations, to speak of any one of them as a whole. But subject to this the Brihad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka is the oldest (and especially Books I\u2013IV), the \u0100ndogya comes next, then the Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki, and Kena, in the order here given. All these are pre-Buddhistic, and the oldest passages in them are some centuries older than the most modern.\n\nAfter Buddhism we have the K\u0101thaka, \u012a\u015ba, \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara, M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0daka, and Mah\u0101-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, all in verse. And to this period probably belong some of the metrical passages, especially those of greater length, in the prose works of the last group, which in the main are older.\n\nYounger than this second group we have a third small group\u2014the Pra\u015bna, Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47iya, and M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya, written, in prose, but in a prose very evidently much later than that used in the Upanishads of the first group.\n\nIt is these fourteen Upanishads of which the philosophic contents is set out in the present volume. The other, still later ones, are only incidentally mentioned. And matter not philosophical\u2014that is, not relating either to the Brahman or to the \u0100tman\u2014is very properly omitted. The very interesting discussion as to the origin of the S\u0101\u1e45khya system out of the older Upanishads comes under the head of their philosophical teaching; and so also do all the questions discussed in the supplementary chapters.\n\nOf the many grotesque, na\u00efve, even superstitious ideas, which find utterance in these crabbed old texts, the present work takes little or no notice, and seeing that the work has been written from the point of view, not of folklore, not of the history of ideas, but of the history of philosophy, it would be unfair to expect that it should.\n\nThe initial position of the author is (p. 42) that the main points in all religions are: 1, the existence of God; 2, the immortality of the soul; 3, the freedom of the will. And\nthat these three points can only be safeguarded by the idealistic philosophy to which the older Upanishads give so deep and so subtle an expression. How can the former part of this proposition be reconciled with Buddhism? or is that not a religion? And if the word God is to have the meaning of the Brahman, how can the proposition be reconciled with Confucianism, or even with the ancient faiths of Greece, of Egypt, and the Euphrates Valley. By a universal consensus of usage all these are called 'religions'; and it would seem rather hard to set up such a definition of religion as would exclude them all.\n\nThe author expresses several times the opinion that in their most essential tenets the thinkers of the Upanishads are at one with a certain line of European thinkers, roughly indicated by the names Parmenides, Plato, Kant, Schopenhauer. This would seem to require some modification. Schopenhauer, at all events, distinctly stated that, if he were to judge all systems by his own, the Buddhist would be the best. Surely Schopenhauer, who was also an enthusiastic admirer of the Upanishads, would not have made such a statement without good cause. It would seem that, in his opinion, the philosophy underlying the Upanishad theories of God and the soul can be held without holding those theories themselves. Now to most readers the Upanishads, apart from the Brahman and \u0100tman theories, would be rather like the play of Hamlet with the part of Hamlet left out.\n\nNeither of these propositions are essential to the purpose of the work, which is to expound the philosophy of the Upanishads. That is done throughout with so much care, with so much scholarship, with such admirable insight, that the present work will be simply indispensable to every student who wishes to rightly understand and adequately appreciate these precious legacies of ancient Indian thought. We have had nothing like it before. In a hundred details of importance the author's rich knowledge has enabled him to throw unexpected light on dark phrases. He brings out with great skill the really essential points. On such questions as the origin of the S\u0101\u1e45khya school; on the doctrine\nof salvation; on the part played by the nobles (rather than the priests) in working out the most vital portions of the Upanishad theory; on the distinction between the ascetic and the recluse; on the origin and growth of the transmigration idea; on the relation of the older Upanishads to the younger ones, and of both to the later Vedanta\u2014we have discussions of the greatest interest; and it is quite safe to say that we have new light on each. It would be obviously impossible within the limits of this short notice to set out, in detail, exactly in how far the author's views on such points go beyond those of his predecessors. And it would be so far undesirable, as everyone should himself read this fascinating volume, of which we hope soon to see a translation into English.\n\nThe previous part dealt with the philosophy of the Vedas and Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The succeeding part will deal with Buddhism. It would add greatly to the usefulness of each part if indices, at least of the Sanskrit words elucidated, had been added. We much hope that this want may be made good in the next part.\n\nT. W. Rhys Davids.\n\nMah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The Epic of Ancient India, condensed into English Verse by Romesh C. Dutt, C.I.E. 12mo; pp. 190. (London: Dent.)\n\nThis is an attempt to give in English verse, and in a small compass, such an epitome of the national poem of India as would be likely to convey to English readers a fair idea of the character of the poem. The author says (in the Epilogue, p. 175) of the Mah\u0101 Bharata:\u2014\n\n\"The work went on growing for a thousand years after it was first compiled and put together in the form of an epic; until the crystal rill of the epic itself was all but lost in an unending morass of religious and didactic episodes, legends, tales, and traditions . . . . Nevertheless the leading incidents and characters of the old epic are still\ndiscernible uninjured by the mass of foreign substance in which they are now imbedded\u2014like those immortal figures, recovered from the ruins of an ancient world, which now beautify the museums of Europe.\"\n\nThe author has accordingly rendered, in a free translation, not an abstract of certain passages, but the whole of such passages as seemed to him to contain the very gist of the original epic. There is only one exception. The eighteen days' battle undoubtedly belonged to the original story. But it is too long in the Sanskrit for the purpose of this little book. That episode has accordingly been greatly condensed. All the rest of the story is told in consecutive lines, just as they stand in the original.\n\nThe metre selected is the metre of \"Locksley Hall.\" The choice is a very happy one. The swing of the trochaic verse more fitly reproduces the sloka than any iambics can do; and the length of the metre chosen corresponds more nearly than the ordinary English blank verse would do to the length of the original verses. An example will show the style.\n\nYudhishthira laments the destruction of his warriors by Bhishma:\n\nAs a lordly tusker tramples on a marsh of feeble reeds,\nAs a forest conflagration on the parched woodland feeds,\nBhishma rides down on my warriors in his mighty battle car.\nGod nor mortal chief can face him in the gory field of war.\nVain our toil, and vain the valour of our kinsmen loved and lost;\nVainly fight my faithful brothers by a luckless fortune crost!\n\nIt may be a question whether it was wise to introduce the element of rhyme which divides off each couplet from others in a way not found in the original, and must frequently have hampered the translator. It is certainly most unfortunate that where Sanskrit names are mentioned they are in some cases so placed in the verse that the stress comes upon the wrong syllable. We hear throughout not\nof Draupadi, but of Draup\u0101di; not of Hastina, or Hastinapura, but of Hastina; not of Uttara, but of Utt\u0101ra; not of S\u0101vitr\u012b, but of Savitri; not of Satyav\u0101n, but of Saty\u0101van; and so on with some other familiar names. It was no doubt difficult to fit the Indian names into the English metre, and whatever one does, the English reader will probably mangle them. But the aid of the metre would have afforded a great opportunity for teaching the English where rightly to put the stress. So slight a change would be required that we even hope that at least Draup\u0101di and Hastina will disappear from the next edition.\n\nIt is particularly interesting to notice what are the passages which the learned translator has considered to contain the gist of the original epic. He has chosen the following verses\u2014the Roman figures referring to the Book, and the Arabic to the section, of the Calcutta edition.\n\nI. 134\u2013137, 184\u2013189.\nII. 38\u201336, 44, 65, 69, 76, 77.\nIII. 292\u2013296.\nIV. 35, 36, 40\u201343, 44, 53, 62.\nV. 1\u20133, 94, 124\u2013126.\nVI\u2013X. In abstract.\nXI. 10, 11, 16, 17, 26, 28.\nXIV. 85, 88, 89.\n\nThe author hopes elsewhere to put forward his views on the historical growth of the epic. In this little volume they would be out of place. It should be judged as a literary effort, not as historical criticism. And as literary effort it is certainly a very great success. A generous admiration for the original, and a warm sympathy with its tone, a striking command of vigorous and flowing and idiomatic English, a fine sense of rhythm, and a real power of poetic imagination have combined to render this selection just what it is intended to be\u2014a most interesting and attractive way of introducing to English readers what the author considers to be the essence of the grand old Indian poem.\nThe smaller edition quoted at the head of this notice is the popular one at a popular price. There is an *\u00e9dition de luxe* on finer paper, with a number of exquisite illustrations of which one only is inserted in the popular edition. We hope both the enterprising publisher and the successful author will be amply rewarded by the sale of this timely and instructive little book.\n\nRH. D.\n\n**Lieder der M\u00f6nche und Nonnen Gotamo Buddho's; von Karl Eugen Neumann. 8vo; pp. 383. (Berlin: Hofmann, 1899.)**\n\nThis is a translation into German verse of the two collections of poems by the men and women respectively, members of the Buddhist Order during, or immediately after, the Buddha's time. These two anthologies, called the Thera- and Ther\u012b-gh\u0101\u1e6d\u0101, consist in great part of verses not found elsewhere in the canon, but also contain the verses only taken from episodes in mixed prose and verse in other books. These latter cases\u2014in which the verses are really only rightly intelligible by means of the light thrown upon them by the prose setting in which they are found\u2014make it highly probable that all the verses must originally have been handed down in a similar prose setting. The commentator, Dhammap\u0101la of K\u0101\u015bipura, who wrote a thousand years later, embodies in his work the tradition as to what this ancient prose setting was. But even with this assistance it is often not easy to gather the exact force of the ecstatic outbursts of feeling which these old verses record.\n\nThe task undertaken by the translator is therefore no easy one; though, of course, a successful solution of it would afford most valuable evidence of a characteristic phase, not only of Buddhist, but of Indian thought. The difficulty is increased by the frequent use in these lyrics of Pali words and phrases so pregnant with meaning and association that they cannot possibly be rendered by a single European word without thereby ignoring much of their\nconnotation and thus really misrepresenting the original. The translator has indeed a rare command of vigorous and varied language. His wide reading, sympathetic appreciation, and philosophic training give him great advantages. And he could no doubt give weighty reasons for the great changes he has ventured to make in his renderings of many of the most important of the technical terms in which the early Buddhists gave expression to their views of life. But he gives no reasons, or only in the curtest way. He has made an interesting and suggestive note on the meaning of vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a in his \"Anthologie.\" If he has any desire to convince his fellow scholars he would do well to give us many more such notes. And if it be considered that a volume of translations is scarcely the place for them, then it would seem desirable that he should thresh out these important questions of detail before he devotes his valuable leisure, and his great gifts, to more translations, the value of which, certainly to scholars, and also to the general reader, really depends precisely on the accuracy of these details. Dr. Neumann will scarcely complain of a point of view that really amounts to a desire to have more of Dr. Neumann.\n\nR.H. D.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(April, May, June, 1899.)\n\nI.

Wilson.\n\nOf the subscribing Libraries one has retired and seven have been added to the list.\n\nThese figures show a total increase of twenty-two subscribing members and libraries; somewhat more than the average increase of previous years. The actual number of subscribers on the 1st January, 1894, was 493, and on the 1st January, 1899, was 553, showing an increase of sixty, or an average increase of twelve a year. The difference between this number and that of the current year is chiefly accounted for by the accession of the new library members. But the most important fact in our list of members for the year 1898 is that during the year there has been an increase of five in the number of resident or full members. For many years the number of the resident members has gone slowly, but steadily, down. This is the first occasion on which the Council have to announce, not only no decrease, but a substantial addition to our numbers. The total receipts from members' subscriptions last year was \u00a3578 2s. 7d. This year it is \u00a3612 1s. 6d.\n\nThe gradual improvement in the amount received by the Society for interest and dividends has been maintained. Last year it stood at \u00a341 13s. 4d. This year it is \u00a346 3s. 9d.\nAnd the Society has deposited during the year a further sum of \u00a340 18s. in the Post Office Savings Bank. The total investments of the Society are now worth, at the market rates of the day, about \u00a31,350, the serious withdrawals owing to expenditure rendered necessary by the terms of our lease having been more than repaid out of current revenue.\n\nThe receipts from rents have slightly risen, showing \u00a3180 19s. as against \u00a3175 14s. And the remaining principal item on the credit side of our small balance-sheet shows a very satisfactory change, the sales of the Society's Journal having produced last year \u00a3188 2s. 4d. and this year \u00a3224 12s. 1d. This is the largest sum hitherto received in one year from such sales. It can be principally accounted for by the sale of one set of back numbers; but is also partly due to the small, but steady, increase in the number of the libraries purchasing the Journal as regular subscribers.\n\nAltogether the nett receipts of the Society have been \u00a31,341 4s. 8d., which is again the largest income received in any one year since the foundation of the Society.\n\nThe figures on the other side of the account show an advance, as against last year's expenditure, of about \u00a35 in the binding of books, of \u00a315 12s. 3d. in very necessary house repairs, and of \u00a314 10s. 6d. in the amount placed in the Savings Bank; and \u00a315 has been spent towards the completion of the Catalogue of the Society's very valuable collection of Sanskrit MSS., which has remained for so many years, owing to want of funds, uncatalogued. The preparation of this catalogue has necessarily taken a long time. But the Council hope this year to go to press with a work which will so greatly facilitate to scholars the use of the rare treasures which the Society owes to the generosity of Colonel Whish and Mr. Tod.\n\nThe accounts also show the present state of the two new undertakings upon which the Society has started \u2014 the Oriental Translation Fund and the Medal Fund.\n\nUnder the Translation Fund ten volumes have already, thanks to the generosity of Mr. F. F. Arbuthnot, been\npublished. Another volume, a translation of the \"Chronicles of Jerahmeel,\" by Dr. Gaster, is in the press. And the next, the translation of an ancient \"Manual of Buddhist Ethics and Psychology,\" by Mrs. Rhys Davids, will go to press this year. The expense of this last volume has been provided for by Mr. E. T. Sturdy. The Council congratulate the Society that this endeavour to meet a long-felt want has now reached so satisfactory a stage; and they would renew their very cordial thanks to Mr. Arbuthnot, who has given not only his gifts in money but so much care and thought to place this series of translations on a lasting basis. They venture also to express the hope that other members of the Society will follow the excellent example set by Mr. Sturdy, and come forward to pay for the translation of one or other of the numerous MSS. on the Society's shelves which still practically remain inaccessible to historical students.\n\nThe Council are glad to point out that the contributions to the Medal Fund, during the year under review, amounted to \u00a363 15s., received in part from new donors, in part from previous donors who have renewed their subscriptions. But the fund is not yet complete. The Council are naturally anxious to place it on a permanent basis by investing a sum large enough to produce the income required. For that purpose about \u00a3200 is still required. And the Council desire to record their very grateful thanks to Mr. Wollaston, to whom the Society is indebted for the idea, and who has devoted so much time and trouble to ensure its success.\n\nThe French and German Asiatic Societies publish, besides their Journals, monographs or texts, too long for the Journal, but of great importance from the point of view of Oriental research. In their last report the Council gave expression to the hope that they would be able to do something of a similar kind. The first volume of this series of \"Asiatic Studies\" is now in the press. It is a volume by Major Gerini, of Bangkok, on the Geography of Ptolemy, more especially as regards Further India. It will be brought out in conjunction with the Geographical Society,\nas a joint contribution to our knowledge of historical geography. And it is a work from this point of view of very great importance.\n\nThe titles of the articles in the Journal of the year is evidence of the vast range of those inquiries which the Society was founded to carry on. The history of land tenure and commerce, the decipherment of ancient inscriptions from all parts of the Eastern world, the geography and history of India, the literature and the beliefs of Syria, Armenia, and Persia, the language of Somaliland, the past struggles in Central Asia, the philosophic conceptions of the founder of Buddhism, the travels of Vasco da Gama and Marco Polo, the epic poetry of India, the poetry and philosophy of Persian Sufis, Chinese accounts of Indian historical persons and places, the migration of popular folklore and stories from the East to the West, even the history of the game of chess\u2014there would seem to be nothing human alien to the Society's work, and it has been the object of the Council to see that every item of that work shall contain some distinct addition to human knowledge on the subject dealt with. The Council deem it not superfluous thus to remind the members of the Society of the difficulty, and of the wide interest, of the objects the Society has set before itself to accomplish. Compared with what it has to do, it is able, with the very limited means at its disposal, to do but little. This is really, almost entirely, a question of money. The Council feel justified in pointing to the amount of matter provided in the Journal, and the high level of the scholarly work it contains, to the resuscitation of the Oriental Translation Fund, and now to the establishment of the series of monographs on \"Asiatic Studies,\" as proofs that the Society is very much alive to the important intellectual and educational interests it was founded to subserve.\n\nThe Council have not lost sight during the year of the pressing question of the establishment in London, and in connection with the new University, of an Oriental School similar in organization and efficiency to those provided\nby the Governments of France, Germany, Austria, and Russia in their respective capitals. The Council have considered it inadvisable to take any public steps until such time as the new University, to which it is very desirable that the proposed school should be attached, has been formally constituted. This is now being rapidly done by the Statutory Commission sitting under the presidency of Lord Davey. The Commission has power to fix the number of faculties into which the University shall, at starting, be divided. The Council have applied to the Commission to create a faculty of Oriental Languages, History, and Archaeology in the reorganized University. Future action must await the decision of the Commission upon this application, and the Council hope to be able to show substantial progress in their next report.\n\nThe Council have to report that the change inaugurated by the Society at its last annual meeting in the terms of membership has so far worked satisfactorily. Seven members had been admitted under the new rules at the close of the year, and about as many have been elected since. In this way the Society has secured the support of a number of gentlemen who would not probably, under the old rules, have become members. And to that extent its power of work has increased. The Council would recommend that the rules remain in force for the ensuing year.\n\nUnder the rules of the Society, Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, Sir Frederic Goldsmid, and Sir Raymond West, whose term of three years expires to-day, retire from the Vice-Presidency of the Society. The Council recommend the re-election of those gentlemen for another term of three years, and the election also of Lord Crawford and Balcarres, of the Bishop of Calcutta, and of Sir Charles Lyall.\n\nUnder the rules of the Society, Mr. Beveridge, Mr. Sewell, Professor Bendall, Mr. Bowring, and Dr. Thornton retire this year from the Council. Of these five gentlemen, two only are immediately re-eligible. The Council recommend the election in their place of\u2014\nANNIVERSARY MEETING.\n\n1. Dr. Thornton,\n2. Mr. Sewell,\n3. Colonel Temple,\n4. Mr. A. G. Ellis,\n5. Sir Cuthbert Peek.\n\nThe Council regret to have to report the death during the year of Professor Friedrich M\u00fcller, of Vienna, one of the Honorary Members of the Society; and would recommend the election in his stead of Professor Karabacek, of Vienna, the distinguished historian and Arabist.\n\nThe Council would also recommend that the following names be removed from the list of the Society's members, in accordance with Rule 3, on the ground of non-payment of subscriptions\u2014\n\n1. Mr. W. Bang,\n2. Mr. B. Borrah,\n3. Mr. A. O. Dass,\n4. Rev. J. Doyle,\n5. Mr. W. Pereira,\n6. Dr. Indraji.\n\nThe usual statement of accounts is laid upon the table.\n\nColonel R. C. Temple, in proposing the adoption of the Report, said:\u2014Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014It is with very great pleasure that I have to propose the adoption of the Report of the Council that we have just heard read to-day, because it is peculiarly grateful to me after my return to England from another long sojourn in India to find that the Royal Asiatic Society, with which I have had the honour to be so long connected, is, owing to the action of the present Council, in even a more flourishing condition than of old. I do not think we need have any difficulty in congratulating the Council and the Officers of the Society in being able to lay before us such a Report as that we have heard read by Professor Rhys Davids.\n## ABSTRACT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR 1898.\n\n### RECEIPTS.\n\n| Description                                      | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Subscriptions\u2014                                   |         |\n| 83 Resident Members at \u00a33 3s.                    | 261 9 0 |\n| 1                                                | 3 3 0   |\n| 185 Non-Resident Members at \u00a31 10s., with exchange | 277 11 6|\n| 6                                                | 0 0 0   |\n| 7                                                | 12 9 0  |\n| 26                                               | 27 6 0  |\n| 1 Compounder's extra subscription                | 1 13 0  |\n| 7 Library Members at \u00a31 10s.                     | 10 10 0  |\n| Composition                                       | 47 5 0  |\n| Donation from the India Office                   | 210 0 0 |\n\n### EXPENDITURE.\n\n| Description                                      | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| House\u2014Rent                                       | 314 0 0 |\n| Fire Insurance                                   | 4 0 0   |\n| Water                                            | 12 0 0  |\n| Gas                                              | 18 0 0  |\n| Coal                                             | 4 10 0  |\n| Income Tax                                       | 6 13 4  |\n| Repairs                                          | 2 17 0  |\n| Salaries\u2014Secretary                               | 250 0 0 |\n| Assistant Secretary                              | 50 0 0  |\n| Journal\u2014Printing                                 | 305 2 0 |\n| Illustrations                                    | 29 0 0  |\n| Library\u2014New Books                                | 17 12 11|\n| Binding                                          | 10 17 0 |\n| For Preparation of Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS     | 15 0 0  |\n| Housekeeper                                      | 52 9 11 |\n| Stationery                                       | 60 0 0  |\n| Miscellaneous                                    | 11 2 0  |\n| Boy, wages                                       | 18 4 0  |\n| Bank Charges                                     | 0 5 0  |\n| Stamps\u2014General                                   | 23 0 0  |\n| Journal                                          | 24 0 0  |\n| Petty Cash                                       | 49 0 0  |\n| Returned Subscriptions                           | 22 2 10 |\n| Transferred to P.O.

In Sir Henry Peek and Sir Charles Murray we have lost Members who have been more distinguished in other fields than in ours, and the eminent names of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and Professor B\u00fchlcr were before the Society at the last Meeting, with, I regret to say, the result in the case of the former of merely a promise of a detailed notice later on. But Professor B\u00fchlcr had a very warm notice at the very competent hands of Professor Max M\u00fcller, and, though this is the case, it may perhaps interest some of you here to be informed that I have been successful in procuring the co-operation of some twenty well-known scholars and friends of that great master of Oriental learning in preparing for him a memorial number in the Indian Antiquary, which is to be written in his honour and in memory of his splendid services and his kindly and genial personality.\n\nIn Mr. C. J. Rodgers I have lost a personal acquaintance, and this Society has lost an able colleague in Oriental work. He represented a class of Englishmen which has, I am glad to say, always existed among us, and of which we may be proud; because he was a very poor man, and the line of life he adopted was not one likely to bring him in any wealth, and yet he was content to spend every hour of his leisure in forwarding such a difficult study as Oriental numismatics. I see I carry this meeting with me that our respect is due to his memory and also to others like him who are working in the same way. There are two other names that I ought to mention, whose removal by death has been of too recent occurrence to be mentioned in the Report. In the first place, it is simply necessary for me to mention at such a meeting as this so great a name as that of Sir M. Monier-Williams, the author of the Sanskrit Dictionary, and the founder of the Oriental Institute at Oxford. But there has been removed from our Society another name, and I do not think that we ought to separate\nto-day without some tribute of respect to the strong personality that has been labouring amongst us for so many years. In Dr. Leitner Oriental learning has lost a most enthusiastic and instructive exponent, and though what I may call the *perfervidum ingenium* which pervaded him may sometimes have brought him into very sharp antagonism with his compeers, yet I do not think that anyone is present who would not wish that this Society should pay a public tribute of respect to his memory, and I may remind you that he was a member for something like forty years.\n\nThere have been losses, of course, on account of resignation during the past year, and although this is inevitable, and it is impossible for us to control the reasons which cause members to resign, yet I think that it is very much to be regretted that Indian officials who have done so much for what our Continental friends call Indianism, as Captain Bower and Colonel Jacob, should have felt bound to resign. It seems to me, and I put it forward as a reasonable proposition, that it is the duty of every old Indian so long as he lives, and so long as he has the power, to support a Society like this, which has for its objects the increase of our learning and knowledge of India.\n\nIt is a more grateful task to mention the accessions to the list of members, and in the Society's Report there are some notable facts in this respect, due, I understand, to the action of the Council during the past year. There have joined us such well-known Indian officials as Sir Henry Davies, Sir Peter Lumsden, and Sir Donald Macnabb, and also so distinguished a linguist as General Toker, and so distinguished a student of things Punjabi as Mr. Macauliffe, and we have also secured the allegiance of the new Bishop of Calcutta. Now this is exactly as it ought to be, and I hope you will join with me in encouraging the Council in going on with such successful efforts as these. We have some clue as to what is likely to happen in the future under its guidance, for this very day we have had announced to us that such important gentlemen as Mr. Yerburgh and Sir Charles Lyall have joined us.\nTurning now to the business part of the Report, I find that there are several matters to encourage us. In the first place, there has been an increase of our members and a consequent increase in the amount of subscriptions; and not only that, there has been an arrest of that decrease in the number of resident members that has been going on for so very long. Then the sale of the Journal, we have been told, is the largest on record, and that has been partly due to the increase in the number of Libraries subscribing, which is most satisfactory; and all this has brought about what we all like to see in every state of life, the largest income that the Society has yet seen. I need hardly call upon you to congratulate the Council in achieving such a result as this. With our increased income, there has been an increase in expenditure, but that has been in useful and desired directions, and amongst other things on which money has been spent has been the cataloguing of the manuscripts belonging to the Society, and I hope that money will long continue to be spent in this direction, because it is really a very important point. If any of you will take the trouble to follow up the history of any particular form of Oriental learning in any part of Europe, you will find that the success of any particular branch has always been dependent on the presence of an accessible library of manuscripts in the neighbourhood, and therefore I say that we should do all in our power to continue the good work here. The Report mentions also some successful action in the matter of the Oriental Translation Fund, due to the private munificence of Mr. Arbuthnot and in a less degree of Mr. Sturdy. Now, ladies and gentlemen, of course we know that in a Society like this the majority of us must be members who are unable to follow their example, however much we may wish to do so. But it is the very existence of such a majority which should make us all the more grateful to Messrs. Arbuthnot and Sturdy, and make us join in the wish of the Council that the minority, or such as can do so, should come forward with funds for further volumes; and in this matter perhaps\nI may be permitted to give a little hint to the managers of the fund, and that is that estimates should be prepared of the cost of any works that are desired, and that, armed with these, efforts should be made to procure subsidies for their production.\n\nIn the matter of the Medal Fund, we have again to thank the private pecuniary assistance and labours of another member of this Society, and in proposing for your acceptance a vote of thanks to Mr. Wollaston for his services, I would like to point out that all that is now necessary is to secure an income of \u00a38 per annum, and for this purpose it is necessary to get together about \u00a3300, of which over \u00a3100 is already in hand. Of course, the object of creating this fund is to prevent the grant of the medal being dependent upon chance subscriptions as it becomes due from year to year. The important and practical matter of the Oriental School I think we had better leave entirely in the hands of our President, and I should not propose to do more now than to ask you to join me in hearty good wishes for its success, in which our President has taken so great and so lasting an interest. The last point I would bring to your notice in the Report is the proposal of the Council to prolong the new rules of membership. We have been told that this has resulted in securing the allegiance of certain gentlemen who might otherwise have held aloof, and I take it to be our obvious duty that, as a Society, we should support the Council in any line of action which has the result of strengthening our position.\n\nI have detained you long enough, but I do not think that I should close my remarks without some allusion to the officers of this Society, whose work we members are only too apt to take entirely as a matter of course. The Report we have heard is one of a successful year's work, and although our thanks are due in the first instance to the Council, who are responsible for the work, yet much of their action must have been based upon the advice and assistance of the officers, and I think, and I hope you will agree with me, that we should be wanting in proper\ngratitude if we were not also to extend our thanks to them. With these remarks, Mr. Chairman, I have the honour to propose that the Report of the Council be adopted as it stands. (Applause.)\n\nSir F. Goldsmid: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I have been requested to second the proposal to adopt the Report which has just been read to you, and I consider it an honour and a privilege to be permitted to do so. Unblest with the gift of spontaneous eloquence, and unprepared to enter into details such as Colonel Temple has, with so much readiness and ability, put before you in his interesting statement, I must confine myself to words the paucity and plainness of which will, it is hoped, be excused, as coming from a somewhat broken-down member of the Asiatic Society, who is compelled to absent himself from your meetings more often than he could wish.\n\nI need not repeat the congratulations which have already been offered on the continued success of the Society, and which are so thoroughly its due; but, as one who held the office of your Secretary some years ago, I feel it a duty as well as pleasure to bear testimony to the great ability of my successor in that appointment, now sitting at your table. His work is by no means an easy one. The Royal Asiatic is not a Society to attract the million. We cannot say to the ordinary outsider, \"Drop in for an hour or so to our monthly meeting: the discussion may perhaps amuse you.\" Our object is rather to instruct than to amuse; and although our public is a small one, it requires to be provided for, and that satisfactorily. Much depends on the personality of the Secretary to make our cause popular. He has not only to keep himself au courant with Oriental studies of the day at home and abroad, but to awaken in others that kind of interest in them which practically tends to the successful performance of his own duties. Our direct appeal to the general public is, as you are aware, through the Journal. By this we are known and judged in the outer world. It appears to me that the high character of its contributions, to which I feel at liberty to testify from, at least, the\nperiod of my own resignation of the Secretaryship to the present time, is so marked as to call for special recognition. It would be an invidious task to allude now to individual contributors; but I note that our learned and industrious Secretary is himself one of them. There is no mistake, then, that whether we treat the question financially or in a literary sense, what the Society is doing means progress, and progress in a healthy and right direction.\n\nI will not take up your time by further remarks, for I am quite sure you will agree with me that we are greatly indebted to the President and Officers of this Society for what has been done in it. Had I the power of expression, as I aspire to have of appreciation, I should not be found so much at fault as you may well hold me to be on the present occasion of addressing you.\n\nMr. Wollaston: Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014It is a popular belief in the Muhammadan world that every man has his 'qismat,' or, as we should say in England, his fate, which dogs him at every turn. I am no exception to the rule. My destiny, unfortunately, is when there is nothing to say to find myself invariably asked to say it, and that is my reason for addressing you at the present time. I am directed to speak a few words about, of course, my pet subject, the Medal. Well, I do not propose to waste time by discussing whether it was right or wrong to found the Medal. I take it for granted that to a man, and, if I may use the phrase, to a woman, we are all agreed that it was in every way fitting to take that step, and we are glad we have done so; but I do not know whether you have all thoroughly grasped what doing it means. What is founding a Medal? In the first place\u2014pardon me if I go into a few details\u2014you have to get that very necessary beginning, a die, and you have to pay for it. A die has been prepared, and I believe it is generally admitted to be of a very exquisite design. I am delighted to say that it is paid for, and that therefore may be wiped off the list. So far, good; now the next thing we have to do is to provide a medal every third year. When I tell\nyou that the medal itself intrinsically costs something like \u00a324 you may well understand that current expenses going on from year to year, or, at any rate, during every third year, are not inconsiderable. We have met all this, and at the present moment we stand with our die, and our expenses paid, and \u00a3110 in hand. (Hear, hear.) I for one think this is supremely satisfactory, and, if I may, speaking on behalf of the Council, I would tender to all you here, and to all the many others who are not here, our gratitude for your great liberality. And yet, withal, I am not content; I want to plead for more. I daresay some of you read a paper called *Truth*, which is continually giving a series of articles on what they call \"The Pest of Society,\" the begging letter-writer. Ladies and gentlemen, I am one of the pests of society; I am a begging letter-writer. I have written you two circulars, and if all goes well I shall in a few short weeks address you a third one, asking you if you will add again to your contributions. But let me encourage you. The first that was issued brought in \u00a3100; now for a small Society I call that magnificent. Our second, which of course it was not contemplated would be equally successful, produced \u00a360. I think perhaps that is even more satisfactory than the first. A third is in the incubatory stage, it having only just been put into type; but we have already received two donations of \u00a35, and we stand with \u00a314 to our credit before we begin. I think that is most auspicious, and it encourages me to explain what I ask you to do. We want \u00a3200. For an individual it is a considerable sum. We have been trying with signal failure to get millionaires to give the entire amount, but my stock of millionaires is rather limited, and I have not succeeded in finding one that would rise to the occasion; still, I think that we may perhaps do without them, and I would suggest that you should really take the matter seriously in hand and see what you could do. I do not say to each of you, give \u00a35; I do not expect you to give such a sum, and I do not ask you to do so; but it is not difficult to collect \u00a35 if you really put your backs\ninto it and mean business, as the Americans say. If each person would do that, when we meet next year we should be able to tell you that the Medal had not only been founded\u2014that is a fact\u2014but endowed.\n\nThe adoption of the Report was then put to the meeting by the Chairman and carried unanimously.\n\nMr. H. Thomson Lyon moved and Dr. Cust seconded that a formal vote of condolence should be sent from the Society to the relatives of Dr. Leitner.\n\nMr. Sewell moved and Dr. Thornton seconded that a similar vote of condolence and sympathy should be sent to the widow of Sir M. Monier-Williams. In doing so Dr. Thornton called attention to the fact that Sir M. Monier-Williams had been a member of the Society from the year 1846, and that great as his labours had been in other matters, he was especially known to the Royal Asiatic Society as having been the first Chairman of an interesting Committee known as the Transliteration Committee. He was the first who moved in that direction, and the result of his labours may be now seen in every number of the Journal, which contains the decision of the Congress, adopting mainly the proposals that originated with the Committee of which he was the distinguished Chairman.\n\nBoth resolutions were carried unanimously.\n\nSir M. E. Grant Duff: Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I felt very much honoured when the suggestion was recently made to me that I should come here to-day and propose the re-election of our President, Lord Reay, for the term of three years. When it was first proposed that Lord Reay should become President of the Asiatic Society, it was felt by many people that there could not have been a better choice, because he was the only person in England, I may say the only person in the world, who represented the two countries which have been most successful in establishing and perpetuating European Empires in Asia. I myself, when I first came to know Lord Reay, which is well on to forty years ago, thought that it was extremely probable that some day he would be Governor\nof Netherlands India, and that it would be very pleasant to go out to stay with him in Java. It does not appear to have been written in the fates of either of us that we should go to Netherlands India; but a thing, which at that time appeared very much more improbable, came to pass. We both went to govern Presidencies in British India; I went to stay with him at Bombay, and he came to stay with me at Madras.\n\nBut we have not now merely to think of the *prima facie* view which had influence when Lord Reay was first elected here, because no sooner had he entered on the office of President than he confirmed in the most ample manner the wisdom of the choice that had been made, and showed that he was capable of performing very great services for the Society. He gave it the most unstinted and ungrudging labour, and he helped it also by his very extensive social relations, not only in this country, but on the Continent of Europe. If it were only for what he has already done during the period in which he has guided the fortunes of the Society, we should, I think, be inclined, by the best kind of gratitude, to desire to re-elect him. But, ladies and gentlemen, we are impelled in that direction not only by the best kind of gratitude\u2014the gratitude for past favours\u2014but by that other kind of gratitude which is a fervent desire to receive favours in the future. Now Lord Reay is singularly well suited to assist the Society in several most important ways at this particular time. In the first place, there is going to be in the month of October an Oriental Congress in Rome, and I do not think anyone could represent the Society better than a man who speaks so many tongues, and who also has such extensive connections amongst the sort of people who are likely to assemble for that Congress upon the Seven Hills. That is not all. At this moment there is on the part of the Society a very great desire that there should be an Oriental Faculty established in connection with the new Teaching University, as it is called, which is about to be brought into existence in London. Lord Reay has always been extremely sanguine\nabout the prospects of that Teaching University. That is a matter about which I will not express any opinion, because I hold to the good rule that in such matters one had better not prophesy unless one knows. However, there are a great many other people who are extremely sanguine about that University, and who believe that it will perform great things. Now Lord Reay, having been connected with the original Commission, and keeping the question always very much in view, is the person best fitted to urge the opinions which he shares in common with, I think, nearly all whom I see around me, about the great importance of having an Oriental School in connection with the University. That he will do so I make no doubt whatever. I am not at all sure that statesmen would not have done better a few years ago if they had established some such centres of light as an Oriental Faculty, rather than take the steps which they did take, with reference to primary education and the methods of paying for it, but I am also not sure that Lord Reay, as head of the London School Board, would exactly share my view as to that particular matter. I will accordingly say nothing more about it, except to point out the undoubted fact that Lord Reay, being Chairman of the London School Board, is in a particularly good position to urge the importance of establishing a Faculty of this kind in the London University. For the fact of his being Chairman of the London School Board shows by itself that he has a very high reputation among, and is very much listened to by, the sort of persons who occupy themselves most with education. These, ladies and gentlemen, are my principal reasons for desiring and proposing on this occasion that you should again elect our President for a term of three years. (Applause.)\n\nSir Raymond West: Sir M. E. Grant Duff, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I feel a peculiar pleasure in being called upon to second the resolution which is now before you. I had the honour and happiness to work, as a member of the Government, along with Lord Reay for some years in India, and I had the opportunity there of proving at\nclose quarters the intense interest which he felt in everything which conduced to the welfare and advancement of the population of that country, and especially that portion of it which was under our control as members of the Government of Bombay. I think that there is no gentleman or lady well acquainted with India here, especially no native of India here, who does not appreciate the very great services that Lord Reay rendered to India, not only in the material elements of improvement which he set in motion in that country, but by the spirit in which he worked and the generous sympathy which he was able to show and to evoke from the large native population; a spirit which is too much neglected on many occasions and by too many persons, but which must be the source of our progress and ultimate abiding success as governors and rulers of that country, and which in the far-off future will, as I trust, lead to a closer and closer assimilation of aims, ends, and feelings between these two most important sections of Her Majesty's subjects, as in all other sections of her dominions.\n\nLord Reay in India devoted himself to scholarship, without being a professed Oriental scholar. Nothing that was brought forward in that sphere escaped his attention, or failed to enlist his sympathy; but he devoted himself more especially during the latter portion of his time in the Bombay Presidency to the advancement of medical science and of technical instruction, and in Bombay alone I believe has anything of serious import in that direction been as yet achieved. A pattern has been set, which may well be followed in other parts of India, and I believe it will be followed, because the ideas he fostered are fermenting in the minds of the people through the country, and the necessity is becoming more and more apparent of working on such lines as Lord Reay instituted in the Bombay Presidency for the material advancement of the community. This much by way of introduction.\n\nI felt, then, when Lord Reay was first elected as President of this Royal Asiatic Society that he would render it\nimportant practical services. That expectation, which was shared, I believe, by most members of the Society, has been more than realized. We who have been concerned in the direction of the affairs of the Society have felt from day to day that we could not have been presided over by anyone more efficient, more zealous, and in every way more capable than Lord Reay. (Applause.) You, ladies and gentlemen, who are sitting here have had many opportunities of seeing in what an urbane and appreciative way he has filled the President's chair, how frequently, brightening our dry discussions with a few sub-humorous remarks, he has made everything pass off pleasantly. Lord Reay has thus presided to our great advantage on numerous occasions at our meetings here; but, moreover, what a far-reaching and intelligent interest he has on all occasions manifested in the subject of the papers brought before us, whether they were within his own peculiar sphere or not! To me it has been a matter of no little surprise, although I knew of Lord Reay's indefatigable temperament and powers of work, that he should, having to discharge heavy Parliamentary duties, and the still heavier duties of President of the School Board of London, have been able to devote so much attention to the duties which fell upon him as President of the Royal Asiatic Society. But we feel, and we all acknowledge, that no-one could possibly have discharged those duties better, and our gratitude may be best manifested, I think, by our enthusiastically receiving the proposition which has been laid so well before the meeting by Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff, and vote with acclamation the re-election of our outgoing President, Lord Reay. (Applause.)\n\nMr. Yerburgh: Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014As a new member of the Society I feel that I have hardly any locus standi in supporting the resolution before the meeting. Nor can I, as a new member, speak with any knowledge of the various services that Lord Reay has rendered to the Society, services which have been put before us by the two previous speakers. My particular\npoint in venturing to support this motion is with regard to the encouragement of the study of Oriental languages in this country. This is a matter in which I have taken considerable personal interest, and I know that Lord Reay has done a great deal to advance the cause. In the last Session of Parliament I put a question to the Leader of the House with regard to what the Government were prepared to do in this direction, and some four or five days afterwards I received a letter from a gentleman at Berlin telling me that, having seen the very unsatisfactory reply I had had, he was forwarding various papers relating to the Oriental Institute in Berlin, as he wished to show me what the German people were doing to further the study of Oriental languages. I must say that a very great deal has been done by Germany, and a study of the documents sent me throws our neglect of Oriental languages into the greatest possible relief. I have had the pleasure of reading an admirable address on this subject by Lord Reay, which is reported in your Journal, and if I may be permitted to do so, I should like, Sir, to inform you of what is being done in a practical way to meet the difficulties we have to face. The China Association have appointed a Committee upon which they have nominated some gentlemen who are not members of their body, but who are interested in this subject, and the Committee have reason to believe that they will be in a position to appear with some practical proposal before the Governing Body of the new London University. I mean by practical that they will be in a position to approach the Governing Body with a certain amount of money, so to speak, in their hands, to be devoted to an attempt to organize the teaching of Chinese for a certain period of time with the object of ascertaining whether the public will avail themselves of the opportunity sufficiently to warrant the founding and endowing of a Chair. (Applause.) There is another matter upon this point which I may put before you, namely, that this movement for the encouragement of the study of Chinese is also advancing in the North of England. On Friday in this week there\nis to be a meeting in Manchester, called by the Lord Mayor of that City, the object of which is to consider, amongst other subjects, this very important one that I am now dealing with, the study of Oriental languages. It is hoped that money will be forthcoming to establish a Chair for a period of five years, during which it can be ascertained whether any permanent success can be looked for. Some remarks have been made this evening about millionaires. I heard the other day an amusing story of a very new millionaire who had gone to Christie's and said: \"I must have three of the most valuable pictures; I do not mind the painter, the subject, or the price, but I must have them at my house to-night on my walls because I have got a dinner party.\" (Laughter.) I would venture to suggest to this gentleman that a far better way of employing his money and of earning a permanent record for himself would be to give some money to the foundation of such a College of Oriental Study as Germany can boast of in Berlin. (Applause.)\n\nDr. Cust: I beg, on behalf of the Council and the Officers of the Society, to express our entire concurrence with the re-election of Lord Reay. I have been on the Council the whole of those three terms, and I only express myself in the way a distinguished Italian once expressed himself: \"I could not find so good a man as President, and I do not wish for a better one.\" What we want is a scholarly statesman, and in Lord Reay we have found him. I only hope that when this three years is over we shall elect him for another three years.\n\nThe motion was put and carried unanimously.\n\nJune 13.\u2014Lord Reay (President) in the Chair.\n\nIt was announced that\u2014\n\nLord Sandhurst,\nMr. C. F. Rowthorn,\nMr. Gerald Dampier,\nBabu Ramsare Das, and Professor Satish Chandra Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a had been elected members of the Society.\n\nMr. T. G. Pinches read a paper entitled \"Akkadian, or Cryptography,\" illustrated by lantern slides. A discussion followed, in which the Rev. J. Tuckwell and Dr. L\u00f6wy took part. The paper will appear in the October Journal.\n\nII. Contents of Foreign Oriental Journals.\n\nI. Journal Asiatique. S\u00e9rie ix, Tome xiii, No. 1.\n\nDerenbourg (H.).

Leitner.\n\nWe regret to have to record the death of Dr. Leitner, who was for thirty-eight years a member of the Royal Asiatic Society. The son of a physician, he was born at Budapest in 1840, but removed in 1847 to Turkey, where his father had established a practice. His school education was completed at the Malta Protestant College. In 1855, when still a mere lad, he gained, by competitive examination, the post of \u201cFirst Class Interpreter\u201d to the British forces at Shumla, during the last eight months of the Crimean War. After the conclusion of the war, he attended a Muhammadan Theological School at Constantinople. In 1858 he came to England, and matriculated as a student at King\u2019s College, London. At that institution he was soon afterwards appointed lecturer in Arabic, Turkish, and modern Greek, and in 1861 he succeeded the Rev. J. J. S. Perowne, now Bishop of Worcester, as Professor of Arabic and\nMuhammadan Law. He was afterwards elected an Honorary Fellow of the College.\n\nIt was in 1861 that he first became a member of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nIn 1862 the University of Freiburg conferred upon him the degrees of M.A. and Ph.D.\n\nAs Professor at King's College he issued several publications, among which may be mentioned his introduction to a philosophical grammar of Arabic, which was subsequently translated into Arabic and Urdu.\n\nIn 1864 the Panj\u00e1b Government offered the Principalship of the newly founded Lahore-Government-College for public competition. Dr. Leitner, anxious to extend his knowledge of languages and countries, applied, and was successful. On arriving in Lahore he found Indian educational affairs in a far from satisfactory state. The educational dispatch issued by the India Office in 1854 furnished the basis of his operations; its main principle being \"to pave the way for the abolition of the Government-Schools by means of voluntary organizations,\" but its provisions, such as, for instance, the grant-in-aid rules, were imperfectly known or understood by the natives, and decisive steps were still required to make them known. In order to assist the carrying out of the intentions of the 1854 dispatch, he founded the Anjuman-i-Panj\u00e1b, a body intended to stimulate among the upper and more learned classes of native society (which had hitherto kept aloof from the educational enterprises fostered by the Government) a spirit of independent zeal for true education, in a form, which was not merely a feeble copy of Western methods, but which could bring the natives into contact with all that was most valuable in Western thought, through the medium of their own language. To complete the educational work begun by the Lahore College and the Anjuman-i-Panj\u00e1b, a National University for the Panj\u00e1b now became necessary, and the realization of that object for many years occupied Dr. Leitner's endeavours. Fortunately in Sir Donald McLeod, then Governor of the province, in Mr. (now Sir) Lepel\nGriffin, and in many of the native chiefs, he found sympathetic and active coadjutors. The Lahore 'University College' was established in 1870, and under Dr. Leitner's guidance, as Registrar, fulfilled all the purposes of a central University for North-Western India, though the full status of a University was not conferred on it till 1882. It was designed to give an impetus to educational self-government in the native community, and to the revival of the study of the languages of India, Arabic, Persia, and Sanskrit, and by presenting Western thought in forms acceptable to the native mind, to cause it to penetrate more deeply and widely than when, as on the old system, it was brought into direct conflict with National and Religious prejudices. Dr. Leitner's educational views attracted much attention on the part of the native chiefs, and branches of the Anjuman-i-Panj\u00e1b were established throughout the province. A free discussion of literary, scientific, social, and political, subjects was thus stimulated in native society. In 1866, also, with the co-operation of a few friends, he established at Lahore a journal called Indian Public Opinion, \"to represent the desires and wishes of every section of the inhabitants, whether European or native.\" Dr. Leitner and his friends continued this work for a period of ten years.\n\nIn 1882 the Indian Government brought out, as a Report, his \"History of Indigenous Education in the Panj\u00e1b since annexation and in 1882.\" These changes in the educational system of the Panj\u00e1b could not, of course, be carried through without provoking considerable opposition on the part of those, who had been carrying on educational work on the old lines. Even after he had established the Lahore University College, he was bitterly disappointed by the attempts made to divert moneys he had collected from leading natives from the teaching of the Indian and Eastern classics to that of English. In 1882 the Panj\u00e1b University created him its first Doctor of Oriental Learning.\n\nHis work in the Panj\u00e1b University was only half completed, when he retired, completely broken down in health, in 1887. The Emperor of Austria made him a Knight of\nthe Iron Crown, and a Grand Commander of the Order of Francis Joseph, and William I, Emperor of Germany, conferred on him the order of the Crown of Prussia.\n\nThe work of founding and carrying on the Panj\u00e1b University was by no means the only work, that Dr. Leitner did during his residence in India. In 1866 he undertook for the Government an exploration of those regions on the North-West Frontier, into which the British troops have only entered in the last few years, and to which he gave the name of Dardistan, viz., the countries between K\u00e1bul, Badakshan, and Kashmir. From this expedition he brought back political, ethnological, and philological information, which is contained in his various miscellaneous writings on Dardistan. At a later date he kept in constant touch with the regions beyond the frontiers of the Empire, and his house at Lahore was a meeting-place for all sorts of wanderers from Central Asia, who supplied him with useful information.\n\nDuring his residence in India he made a collection of Eastern antiquities and curiosities, of which the most interesting portion, perhaps, is composed of the series of sculptures and casts illustrating the connection between early Indian art and that of other countries, especially Greece. This Greek influence was derived from the Hellenic, or partly Hellenic, kingdoms, which for centuries after the downfall of Alexander the Great's empire maintained themselves in K\u00e1bul, Balkh, Herat, etc. By the action of this Greek art on Buddhism, which at one time exerted a great influence over all India, there was developed a 'Gracco-Buddhistic' art, which long flourished in regions whence all traces of Greek civilization or Buddhistic worship have vanished. Part of this collection is now at the Oriental Institute at Woking, which he established on his return from India.\n\nHe was for the past nine years the proprietor and editor of the Asiatic Quarterly Review, a journal devoted to Oriental research and to imperial interests in Asia and the Colonies.\n\nDr. Leitner died at Bonn, in Germany, on the 22nd of\nMarch, and his remains were brought over and interred in Brookwood Cemetery on the 6th of April.\n\nWe append a list of Dr. Leitner's principal writings:\n\n**LIST OF THE LATE DR.

Monier-Williams, K.C.I.E.\n\nWith the death of Sir M. Monier-Williams, at Cannes, on April 11th, this Society lost a member who had belonged to it for more than half a century. Being in his eightieth year, he was the oldest Professor of Sanskrit in any University. He had occupied the Boden Chair at Oxford for nearly forty years, having succeeded Horace Hayman Wilson, the first Professor of Sanskrit in England, appointed in 1832. The son of Colonel Monier Williams, R.E., he was born at Bombay in 1819. Having been educated at private schools, and at King's College, London, he matriculated at Oxford in March, 1837, but did not go into residence at Balliol until Michaelmas, 1838. Among his fellow-undergraduates at Balliol were Stafford Northcote, Arthur Hobhouse, John Duke Coleridge, Benjamin Jowett, Edward Meyrick Goulburn, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Frederick Temple, Thomas Farrer, and William Rogers. With some of these he rowed in his College Eight at the head of the river in 1839. Having been nominated to a writership in the Indian Civil Service in November of the latter year, and having been examined at the India House at the end of the following December, he left Oxford, went to reside at Haileybury in January, 1840, and at the end of the year passed out of the East India College at the head of the list. But at this point the course of his career was suddenly and entirely changed by the death of his twin brother, killed in a border war in India. In deference to the urgent wishes of his widowed mother, he resolved to remain in England. He accordingly returned to Oxford in May, 1841; but as Balliol was full, and no system of out-college residence existed in those days, he entered at University. This was the College of Sir William Jones, the great pioneer of Sanskrit studies at the end of the last century, and the founder of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784.\n\nA pupil of Professor Wilson in Sanskrit, Monier Williams gained the Boden scholarship in 1843. Taking his degree in the following year, he was appointed to the Professorship\nof Sanskrit, Bengali, and Telugu, at the East India Company's College at Haileybury, a post which he held for about fifteen years, till the College was closed after the Mutiny. During his tenure of this office he is said to have won the high esteem of all his pupils. The last survivor of the teaching staff, he preserved down to his death a lively interest in the history of Haileybury, and took a leading part in editing the Memorials of the old College, published in 1894. After a short interval, during which he held an appointment at Cheltenham College, he was elected Boden Professor of Sanskrit by Convocation at the memorable contest in 1860, of which many senior members of Oxford University retain a lively recollection.\n\nIn the early seventies Professor Williams conceived the plan of founding at Oxford an institution which should be a centre of Oriental learning and a focus for concentrating and disseminating correct information on Indian subjects. This plan he first brought before Congregation in May, 1875. In order to enlist the sympathies of the leading native princes in this project, he undertook at his own expense three journeys to India in 1875, 1876, and 1883; and his persevering efforts were so far crowned with success that he finally managed to collect a fund of close on \u00a334,000. The foundation stone of the new Institute was laid by the Prince of Wales in 1883. The building was erected in three instalments, the first being finished in 1884 and the last in 1896. On July 1st of the latter year the completed Indian Institute was formally opened by Lord George Hamilton, Secretary of State for India, in the presence of a large and representative gathering of the friends of India. Sir Monier thus carried his scheme to a successful issue in the face of difficulties which could only have been surmounted by rare tenacity of purpose. The deep interest he continued to take in the welfare of the Indian Institute, he proved by presenting to its library some years before his death his valuable collection of Oriental MSS. and books to the number of about 3,000.\n\nBrought up in the traditional school of Sanskrit learning\nwhich Professor Wilson and other English scholars acquired from Pandits in India, Professor Monier-Williams never devoted much attention to the historical method of scholarship, consequently taking little interest in the oldest phase of Indian literature represented by the Vedas. He busied himself rather with the publication of the texts of well-known classical Sanskrit writers, with a view to encouraging the practical study of Sanskrit. Thus he brought out an edition of K\u0101lid\u0101sa's Vikramorva\u015bi in 1849 and another of \u015aakuntal\u0101 (2nd ed. 1876). He also published the text, with translation and vocabulary, of the famous Story of Nala.\n\nHe further produced a number of other useful educational works: a Sanskrit Grammar (1846), which ran through four editions, an excellent English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1851), and a Sanskrit Manual for composition (1862). His most important work of this kind was his large Sanskrit-English Dictionary, published in 1872. The substance of some of his lectures given at Oxford soon after he became Boden Professor were embodied in his Indian Epic Poetry (1863), which contains a full analysis of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and of the leading story of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\n\nShortly before and after he returned to Oxford, Monier-Williams also wrote some Hindustani manuals. One of these was An Easy Introduction to the Study of Hindustani (1858), and another his Practical Hindustani Grammar (1862). To the same period belong his Original Papers illustrating the History of the Application of the Roman Alphabet to the Languages of India (1859) and his inaugural lecture on The Study of Sanskrit in relation to Missionary Work in India (1861).\n\nMonier-Williams possessed much literary skill as a translator. His tasteful version in prose and verse of \u015aakuntal\u0101 (1853) has become very popular, having reached a sixth edition at least and finding a place among Sir John Lubbock's Hundred Best Books. His Indian Wisdom (1875), which consists chiefly of translated specimens of Sanskrit literature, appeared in a fourth and enlarged edition in 1893.\nThe late Professor was a frequent advocate of the claims of Missionary enterprise in India; and it was this interest that led him to devote much of his time to writing books meant to diffuse a knowledge of Indian religions in England. All these works display much literary facility and have enjoyed a considerable popularity. More than 12,000 copies of his *Hinduism* (1877) have been sold; his *Modern India and the Indians* (1878) ran through three editions in a couple of years; there have been four editions of his *Religious Life and Thought in India* (1883); and his *Buddhism* (1889) in connection with Brahmanism and Hinduism and in contrast with Christianity, has been widely read.\n\nFailing health obliged Sir Monier Monier-Williams to relinquish in 1887 the active duties of his Chair, which had become very heavy owing to the institution of the Honour School of Oriental Studies at Oxford in 1886. He ceased to reside in the University, spending the winter months in the south of France and the rest of the year at his house in the Isle of Wight. In these declining years of his life he devoted himself with great industry almost entirely to the completion of the second edition of his Sanskrit-English Dictionary, which when published will be twice the size of the first. This work he carried out under the patronage of the India Office.\n\nProfessor Monier-Williams was a Fellow of his old College, Balliol, from 1882 to 1886; was elected an Honorary Fellow of University College in 1892; and was Keeper and Perpetual Curator of the Indian Institute. He was a D.C.L. of Oxford, an LL.D. of Calcutta, and a Ph.D. of G\u00f6ttingen. He was created a K.C.I.E. in 1887.\n\nSir M. Monier-Williams had the good fortune to live just long enough to fully finish his career. Only last year he celebrated his golden wedding in the midst of a prosperous family; he gave the final touch to the last proof-sheet of his Dictionary only a few days before he died; and it is only three years since he saw the entire completion of the Indian Institute, which will stand as a permanent memorial of his indomitable energy in advancing the practical interests of Oriental learning.\n\nA. A. Macdonell.\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nThe Urmi \"Booklet of Crumbs.\"\u2014By an unfortunate misprint, this work has been described in our last issue, p. 453, as the \"Booklet of Counsels.\" Prof. Margoliouth, to whom we owe the notice, had no opportunity of correcting the proof, or the mistake would not have been allowed to pass.\n\nOriental School at Saigon.\u2014The French Government have established at Saigon a \"Mission Arch\u00e9ologique de l'Indo-Chine.\" There is to be a Director, nominated for six years, and re-eligible, who will preside over the studies and edit the proceedings. There will be courses of study in Sanskrit and P\u0101li, and Archaeology, scholarships for students, a library, a museum, and a journal or other proceedings, with a yearly report to be laid before the Minister of Public Instruction. M. Finot, a well-known graduate of the Oriental School at Paris, and a member of our Society, has been appointed the first Director. We express our congratulations to the French Government for inaugurating so useful a scheme; and our best wishes to M. Finot in his new undertaking.\n\nAn International Congress of the History of Religions will be held at Paris from Sept. 3 to Sept. 9, 1900, in connection with the Exhibition to be then held there. It will be under the direction of a commission of scholars connected with the University of France and learned bodies in Paris; the President being M. Albert R\u00e9ville. Information as to the details of the Congress can be obtained from the Secretaries, at the Sorbonne, Paris.\nGOLD MEDAL.\n\nAs our members are aware, Mr. Wollaston is issuing a third appeal for subscriptions towards the establishment on a permanent basis of the Fund for the Society's Gold Medal. The following list shows the result thus far.

Weir, B.D., Assistant to the Professor of Oriental Languages in the University of Glasgow.\n\nDr. William Hunter (d.1783) bequeathed to the University of Glasgow, along with his Natural History Collection, a library containing about twelve thousand volumes of printed books and six hundred manuscripts. The latter were catalogued by G. Haenel, in his Catalogi Librorum Manuscriptorum, Leipzig, 1830, columns 786-798. In regard to the Oriental manuscripts, however, he frequently does no more than state in what languages they are written, and that not always correctly. Thanks to the courtesy of the Keeper of the Museum, who gave every facility of access to the cases, the following is an emended list of the Arabic, Syriac, and Hebrew manuscripts. With the exception of No. 7, none of these is written on vellum.\nARABIC.\n\n1.\nQur\u02be\u0101n: dated 1068 A.H.\n\n2.\nQur\u02be\u0101n: dated Medina, 1057 A.H.\n\n3.\nQur\u02be\u0101n: dated 1082 A.H.\n\n4.\nQur\u02be\u0101n: no date.\n\n5.\nQur\u02be\u0101n: no date.\n\n6\nQur\u02be\u0101n: last few pages fragmentary; chapters 105 to 109 are wanting: no date.\n\n7.\nPart I of the Qur\u02be\u0101n: written on vellum in various colours of ink; titles of chapters, etc., in Kufic characters, the rest in African hand: no date.\n\n8.\nPart III of the Qur\u02be\u0101n: no date.\n\n9.\nPart VII of the Qur\u02be\u0101n: no date.\n\n10.\nPart XXIX of the Qur\u02be\u0101n: no date.\n\n11.\nA small volume containing extracts from the Qur\u02be\u0101n (S\u016brahs 46, 48, 55, 56, 67, and 78) and Prayers: no date.\n12.\n\nThe \"Mugni'l N\u0101\u1e63ihin wa Mu\u1e25di'l '\u0100bid\u012bn,\" a religious compendium, consisting of eighty-four homilies.

Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\n(Continued from page 663.)\n\nAnecdote xiii.\n\nThey relate thus, that Na\u1e63r b. A\u1e25mad, who was the central point of the S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00edd group, whose fortunes reached their zenith during the days of his rule, was most plenteously equipped with every means of enjoyment and material of splendour\u2014well-filled treasuries, an efficient army, and loyal servants. In winter he used to reside at Bukh\u00e1ra, his capital, while in summer he used to go to Samarqand or some other of the cities of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n. Now one year it was the turn of Her\u00e1t. He spent the spring at B\u0101dg\u012bs, where are the most charming pasture-grounds of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n and 'Ir\u00e1q, for there are nearly a thousand watercourses abounding in water and pasture, any one of which would suffice for an army.\n\nWhen the beasts had well eaten, and had regained their strength and condition, and were fit for warfare or to take the field, Na\u1e63r b. A\u1e25mad turned his face towards Her\u00e1t, but halted outside the city of Margh\u00e1z\u00e1r-i-Sap\u00edd and there pitched his camp. Cool breezes from the north were stirring, and the fruit was ripening in the districts of M\u00e1lin and Kar\u00fakh\u00b9\u2014fruit which can be obtained in but few places, and nowhere so cheaply. There the army rested. The climate was charming, the breeze cool, food plentiful, fruit abundant, and the air filled with fragrant scents, so that the soldiers enjoyed their life to the full during the spring and summer.\n\n\u00b9 See Barbier de Meynard's Dict. de la Perse, pp. 487, 511\u2013512, according to which the former village is distant from Her\u00e1t two parasangs, the latter ten.\nThe season arrived, and the juice of the grape was abundant, and the arganite, basil, and yellow rocket were in bloom; they did full justice to the charms of autumn, and took their fill of the pleasures of that season. Mihrgan was permitted, for the cold did not wax severe, and the grapes proved to be of exceptional sweetness. For in the garden there are one hundred and twenty different varieties of the grape vine, each sweeter and more delicious than the other, and amongst them are in particular two kinds which are not to be found in any other region of the inhabited world, one called Tarniyin and the other Guichidi; these are smooth, slender-cored, and luscious, so that you would imagine they were [flavoured with] cinnamon. A cluster of Tarniyin grapes sometimes attains a weight of five minas; they are black as pitch and sweet as sugar, nor can one eat many for the sweetness that is in them. And besides these there were all sorts of other delicious fruits.\n\nThe Amir Nasr b. Ahmad saw Mihrgan and its fruits, and was mightily pleased therewith. Then the narcissus\nto arrive from S\u00edst\u00e1n and the sweet oranges from M\u00e1zan-\ndar\u00e1n; and so they passed the winter in the most agreeable\nmanner.\n\nWhen [the second] spring came, the Am\u00edr sent the\nhorses to B\u00e1dgh\u00eds and moved his camp to M\u00e1lin [to a spot]\nbetween two streams. And when summer came, the fruits\nagain ripened; and when Mihrg\u00e1n came, he said, \u201cLet\nus enjoy Mihrg\u00e1n at Her\u00e1t\u201d; and so from season to season\nhe continued to procrastinate, until four years had passed\nin this way. For it was then the heyday of the S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00edau\nprosperity, and the land was flourishing, the kingdom\nunmenaced by foes, the army loyal, fortune favourable,\nand heaven auspicious; yet withal the Amir\u2019s attendants\ngrew weary, and desire for home arose within them, while\nthey beheld the King quiescent, the air of Her\u00e1t in his\nhead and the love of Her\u00e1t in his heart; and in the\ncourse of conversation he would declare that he preferred\nHer\u00e1t to the Garden of Eden, and would set its charms\nabove those of the springtide of Beauty.\u00b9\n\nSo they perceived that he intended to remain there for\nthat summer also. Then the captains of the army and\ncourtiers of the King went to Ab\u00fa \u2018Abdu\u2019ll\u00e1h R\u00fadag\u00ed,\u00b2\nthan whom there was none more honoured of the King\u2019s\nintimates, and none whose words found so ready an\nacceptance. And they said to him: \u201cWe will present thee\nwith five thousand d\u00edn\u00e1rs if thou wilt contrive some artifice\nwhereby the King may be induced to depart hence, for\nour hearts are dying for desire of our wives and children,\nand our souls are like to leave us for longing after\nBukh\u00e1r\u00e1.\u201d R\u00fadag\u00ed agreed; and since he had felt the\nAm\u00edr\u2019s pulse and understood his temper, he perceived that\nprose would not affect him, and so had recourse to verse.\n\n\u00b9 So A., which reads \u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0631 \u062d\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0646\u064c; while L. has \u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064c, \u201ca Chinese\nspring.\u201d\n\u00b2 See Eth\u00e9\u2019s excellent monograph, and his article in the Encyclopaedia\nBritannica; also p. 62 of the Journal for January, 1899.\nHe therefore composed a *qasida*; and, when the Amir had taken his morning cup, came in and did obeisance, and sat down in his place; and, when the musicians ceased, he took up the harp, and, playing the \"Lover's air,\" began this elegy:\u2014\n\n\"\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0649 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u060c \u0628\u06cc \u06cc\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u060c\n\n\"The J\u00fa-yi-M\u00faliy\u00e1n we call to mind,\nWe long for those dear friends long left behind.\"\n\nThen he strikes a lower key, and sings:\u2014\n\n\"\u0631\u06cc\u06af \u0622\u0645\u0648 \u0648 \u062f\u0631\u0634\u062a\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0648\u060c \u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u0645 \u0628\u0631\u0632\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u060c\n\u0622\u0628 \u062c\u06cc\u062d\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0637 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u060c \u062e\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u062a\u0627 \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u060c\n\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u062e\u0631\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0634 \u0648 \u062f\u06cc\u0631 \u0632\u06cc\u060c \u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u0632\u06cc \u062a\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u060c\n\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0647\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0628\u062e\u0631\u0627 \u0622\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0633\u0648\u06cc \u0622\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u060c\n\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u0633\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0628\u062e\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0633\u0631\u0648\u0633\u0648 \u0628\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc\uff0c\n\n\"The sands of Oxus, toilsome though they be,\nBeneath my feet were soft as silk to me.\nGlad at the friend's return, the Oxus deep\nUp to our girths in laughing waves shall leap.\nLong live Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1!

Thus the Poet-laureate Mu\u2019izz\u00ed was one of the sweetest singers and most graceful wits in Persia, and his poetry reaches the highest level in freshness and sweetness, and excels in fluency and charm. Zaynu\u2019l-Mulk Ab\u00fa Sa\u2019d [b.] Hind\u00fa b. Mu\u1e25ammad b. Hind\u00fa of Isfah\u00e1n\u00b3 requested him to compose an imitation of this qa\u1e63\u00edda, and Mu\u2019izz\u00ed, unable to plead his inability so to do, wrote:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0627\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u060c \u0632\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0635\u0641\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u060c} \\]\n\n\u201cNow advanceth Rustam from M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n,\nNow advanceth Zayn-i-Mulk from Isfah\u00e1n.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 Khing-i-naqbati. To provide against any sudden emergency, a horse, ready saddled and bridled, was kept always at the gate of the King\u2019s palace, and it is this \u2018sentry-horse\u2019 to which reference is here made.\n\n\u00b2 L. has \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0627, and in a marginal note explains bur\u00e1na as meaning turban or handkerchief; but A. has \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0647, and I suspect that it is really a place-name. Cf. Sachau\u2019s remarks on the derivation of al-Bir\u00fani\u2019s name at p. 7 of his translation of the Chronology of Ancient Nations.\n\n\u00b3 See Houtsma\u2019s ed. of al-Bund\u00e1ri\u2019s History of the Selj\u00faqs, pp. 93, 101, 105.\nmen will perceive how great is the difference between this poetry and that; for who can sing with such sweetness as does R\u00fadag\u00ed when he says:\n\n\"Surely are renown and praise a lasting gain,\nEven though the royal coffers lose sustain!\"\n\nFor in this couplet are seven admirable touches of art: first, the verse is apposite; secondly, antithetical; thirdly, it has a refrain; fourthly, it embodies an enunciation of equivalence; fifthly, it has sweetness; sixthly, style; seventhly, energy. Every master of the craft, who has deeply considered the poetic art, will admit, after a little reflection, that I am right.\n\nAnecdote xiv.\n\nThe love borne by Mahm\u00fad Yam\u00ednu'd-Dawla to Ay\u00e1z the Turk is well known and famous. It is related that Ay\u00e1z was not remarkably handsome, but had several good points. Of sweet expression and olive complexion, symmetrically formed, graceful in his movements, sensible and deliberate in action, he was mightily endowed with all the arts of courtiership, in which respect, indeed, he had few rivals in his time. Now these are all qualities which excite love and give permanence to friendship.\n\nNow Mahm\u00fad was a pious and God-fearing man, and he wrestled with his love for Ay\u00e1z so that he did not diverge by so much as a single step from the Path of the Law and the Way of Chivalry. One night, however, at a carousal, when the wine had begun to affect him and love to stir within him, he looked at the curls of Ay\u00e1z, and saw, as it were, ambergris rolling over the face of the moon, hyacinths twisted about the visage of the sun, ringlet upon\nringlet like a coat of mail; link upon link like a chain; in every ringlet a thousand hearts and under every lock a hundred thousand souls. Thereupon love plucked the reins of self-restraint from the hands of his endurance, and lover-like he drew him to himself. But the watchman of \"Hath not God forbidden you to transgress against Him?\" thrust forth his head from the collar of the Law, stood before Mahm\u00fad, and said: \"O Mahm\u00fad, mingle not sin with love, nor mix the false with the true, for such a slip will raise the Realm of Love in revolt against thee, and thou wilt fall like thy first father from Love's Paradise, and remain afflicted in the world of Sin.\" The ear of his fortunate nature being quick to hear, he hearkened to this announcement, and the tongue of his faith cried from his innermost soul, \"We believe and we affirm.\" Then, again, he feared lest the army of his self-control might be unable to withstand the evolutions of the locks of Ay\u00e1z, so, drawing a knife, he placed it in the hands of Ay\u00e1z, bidding him take it and cut off his curls. Ay\u00e1z took the knife from his hands with an obeisance, and, having enquired where he should cut them, was bidden to cut them in the middle. He therefore doubled back his locks to get the measurement, executed the King's command, and laid the two tresses before Mahm\u00fad. It is said that this ready obedience became a fresh cause of love; and Mahm\u00fad called for gold and jewels and gave to Ay\u00e1z beyond his usual custom and ordinary practice, after which he fell into a drunken sleep.\n\nWhen the morning breeze blew upon him, and he arose from sleep to ascend the Royal Throne, he remembered what he had done. He summoned Ay\u00e1z and saw the clipped tresses. The army of remorse invaded his heart, and the peevish headache born of wine settled on his brain. He kept rising up and sitting down aimlessly, and none of the courtiers or men of rank dared to address to him any enquiry, until at length H\u00e1jib 'Ali Qar\u00edb, who was the Chief Chamberlain, turned to 'Un\u1e63ur\u00ed and said, \"Go, show thyself to him.\" So 'Un\u1e63ur\u00ed came in and did obeisance.\nMahmud raised his head and said: \"I was just thinking of you. You see what has happened: say something on this subject.\" 'Unsur\u00ed said:\n\n\u06af\u0631 \u0639\u06cc\u0628 \u0633\u0631 \u0632\u0644\u0641 \u0628\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\u0686\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u063a\u0645 \u0646\u0634\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u062e\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0634 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\u062c\u0627\u06cc \u0637\u0631\u0628 \u0648 \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0637 \u0648 \u0645\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\u06a9\u06cc \u0622\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0634 \u0633\u0631\u0648 \u0632\u0628\u0631\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a.\n\n\"Though shame it be a fair one's curls to shear,\nWhy rise in wrath or sit in sorrow here?\nRather rejoice, make merry, call for wine;\nWhen clipped the express doth most trim appear.\"\n\nMahmud was highly pleased with this quatrain, and bade them bring gold and silver, which he mixed together, and therewith thrice filled the poet's lap. Then he summoned the minstrels before him, and drank wine to [the accompaniment of] those two verses whereby his melancholy had been dissipated, and recovered the equability of his temper.\n\nAssaray XV.\n\nNow you must know that improvisation is the chief pillar of the Poetic Art; and it is incumbent on the poet to train his talents to such a point as to be able to improvise on any subject, for thus is money extracted from the treasury, and thus can the king be made acquainted with any matter which arises. All this is necessary to please the heart of the patron and the humour of him who is the subject of one's eulogies; and whatever poets have earned in the way of great rewards has been gained by improvisations and poems inspired by the occasion.\n\nFathkh\u0101n was a native of S\u016bs\u0101r, and was the son of \u1e62al\u0101\u1e25\u012b, the servant of Am\u012br Kh\u0101n\u0101n\u012b. He was possessed\nof good talents, composed pleasing verses, and was a skilful performer on the harp; and he was retained in the service of one of the dihq\u00e1ns of S\u00edst\u00e1n, who gave him a yearly allowance of two hundred measures of corn, each containing five maunds, and a hundred dirhams in silver coinage of N\u00fah [which amply sufficed for his needs]. But he desired to marry a woman of Khalaf\u2019s clientage, whereby his expenses were increased, and the baskets and trays were multiplied, so that Farrukh\u00ed remained without sufficient provision, nor was there in S\u00edst\u00e1n anyone else save their am\u00edrs. He therefore appealed to the Dihq\u00e1n, saying: \u201cMy expenses have been increased; how would it be if the Dihq\u00e1n should make my allowance of corn three hundred maunds, and raise my salary by five hundred dirhams, so that my means may perhaps become equal to my expenditure?\u201d The Dihq\u00e1n wrote on the back of the appeal: \u201cSo much shall not be refused you, but there is no possibility of any further increase.\u201d\n\nSo Farrukh\u00ed was in despair, and made enquiries of such as arrived and passed by to hear of some patron in some region or part of the world who might look upon him with favour, so that he might chance on a success; until at length they informed him that the Amir Abu\u2019l-Mudhaffar Chigh\u00e1n\u00ed in Chigh\u00e1niy\u00e1n was a munificent patron of this class, conferring on them splendid presents and rewards, and was at that period conspicuous in this respect amongst the kings of the age and nobles of the time. On the subject of this choice Farrukh\u00ed says:\n\n1 The words \u0648 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u06cc are omitted by L.\n\n2 A.\n\n3 L. has \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u06af\u0631 for \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u06af\u0631, so that the sense would then be \u201canyone of their am\u00edrs.\u201d\n\n4 Or, in its Arabicized form, Sigh\u00e1niy\u00e1n, a place in Transoxania, near Tirmidh and Qub\u00e1dhiy\u00e1n. See De Goeje\u2019s Bibl. Geogr. Arab., where it is mentioned repeatedly.\nIn truth it is a fine elegy that he composed on the Poetic Art, incomparable in the beauty of its eulogies.\n\nSo Farrukhi, having furnished himself with what was necessary for the journey, set out for Chigh\u0101niy\u0101n. Now A\u1e25z\u0101b-Mudhaffar had 18,000 mares, roadsters, each one of which was followed by its colt. And every year the Amir used to go out to brand the mares, and at this moment he happened to be at the place where the branding was done; while 'Amid As'ad, who was his steward, was at the capital preparing provisions to be conveyed to the Amir. To him Farrukhi went, and recited a qasida, and submitted to him the poetry he had composed for the Amir.\n\nNow 'Amid As'ad was a man of parts and a poet, and in Farrukhi's verse he recognized poetry at once fresh, sweet, pleasing, and masterly, while seeing the man himself to be ill-proportioned, clothed in a torn jubba worn anyhow, with a huge turban on his head after the manner of the Sagzis, of the most unprepossessing appearance from head to foot; and this poetry, withal, in the seventh heaven. He could not believe that it had been composed by this Sagzi, and, to prove him, said: \"The Amir is at the branding-ground, whither I go to wait upon him; and thither I will take thee also, for it is a mighty pleasant spot\u2014\n\n\u062c\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u062c\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u06cc \u0633\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0632\u0650 \u0628\u064e\u0646\u0650\u06cc\n\n'World within world of verdure wilt thou see'\u2014\n\nfull of tents and lamps like stars, and from each tent come the songs of R\u016bdagi, and friends sit together, drinking wine and making merry, while before the Amir's pavilion a great fire is kindled, in size like unto several mountains,\n\n---\n\n1 The word is \u0631\u0627\u0647\u06cc, explained in the margin of L. as meaning \u06af\u0631\u062f\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u062f\u0648\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0647'.\n\n2 Pish u pas.\nwhereat they brand the colts.

He put aside all his business, mounted Farrukh\u00ed on\na horse, and set out for the Am\u00edr, whose presence he entered\nabout sundown, saying: \"O Sire, I bring thee a poet the\nlike of whom the eye of Time hath not seen since Daqiq\u00ed's\nface was veiled in death.\" Then he related what had\npassed.\n\nSo the Am\u00edr accorded Farrukh\u00ed an audience, and when\nhe came in he did reverence, and the Am\u00edr gave him his\nhand, and assigned him an honourable place, enquiring\nafter his health, treating him with kindness, and inspiring\nhim with hopes of favours to come. When the wine had\ngone round several times, Farrukh\u00ed arose, and, in a sweet\nand plaintive voice, recited his elegy, beginning:\n\n\u0628\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0644\u0642\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0645 \u0632 \u0633\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0627 \u062d\u0644\u0642\u0647 \u062a\u0646\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0632 \u062f\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0632 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u060c\n\n\"In a caravan of merchandise from Sist\u00e1n did I start,\nWith fabrics spun within my brain and woven in my heart.\"\n\nWhen he had finished, the Am\u00edr, himself something of\na poet, expressed his astonishment at this qas\u00edda. 'Am\u00edd\nAs'ad said, \"Wait till you see!\" Farrukh\u00ed was silent\nuntil the wine had produced its full effect on the Am\u00edr,\nthen he arose and recited this elegy on the branding-ground.\nThe Am\u00edr was amazed, and in his admiration turned to\nFarrukh\u00ed, saying: \"They have brought in a thousand colts,\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1892.\nall with white foreheads, fetlocks, and feet. Thou art a cunning rascal, a Sagz\u00ed; catch as many as thou art able, that they may be thine.\" Farrukh\u00ed, on whom the wine had produced its full effect, came out, took his turban from his head, hurled himself into the midst of the herd, and chased a drove of them before him across the plain; but, though he caused them to gallop hither and thither, he could not catch a single one. At length a ruined rest-house situated on the edge of the camping-ground came into view, and thither the colts fled. Farrukh\u00ed, being tired out, placed his turban under his head in the porch of the rest-house, and at once went to sleep, by reason of his extreme weariness and the effects of the wine. When they counted the colts, they were forty-two in number. The Amir, on being told of this, laughed and said: \"He is a lucky fellow, and will come to great things. Look after him, and look after the colts as well. When he awakes, waken me too.\" So they obeyed the King's orders.\n\nNext day, after sunrise, Farrukh\u00ed arose. The Amir had already risen, and, when he had performed his prayers, he gave Farrukh\u00ed an audience, treated him with great consideration, and handed over the colts to his attendants. He also ordered Farrukh\u00ed to be given a horse and equipments suitable to a man of rank, as well as a tent, three camels, five slaves, wearing apparel, and carpets. So Farrukh\u00ed prospered in his service, and enjoyed the greatest circumstance, and waited upon Sultan Mahm\u00fad, who, seeing him thus magnificently equipped, regarded him with the same regard, and his affairs reached that pitch of prosperity which they reached, so that twenty servants girt with silver girdles rode behind him.\n\nAnecdote xvi.\n\nIn the year A.H. 510 (A.D. 1116\u20131117) the King of Isl\u00e1m Sanjar, the son of Maliksh\u00e1h the Selj\u00fac (may God be merciful to him!), chanced to be encamped at the spring season within the marches of T\u00fas, in the plain of Tar\u00faq,\nwhen I, in hopes of obtaining some favour, joined his Court from Her\u00e1t, having then nothing in the way of equipment or provision. I composed a qa\u1e63\u012bda and went to Mu'izz\u012b, the Poet-laureate, to seek for his counsel and support. He looked at my poem, and, having tested my talents in several ways, behaved in the most noble manner, and deemed it his duty to act in the way befitting so great a man.\n\nOne day I expressed in his presence a hope that Fortune would be more favourable to me, and complained of my luck. He answered genially: \"Thou hast laboured hard to acquire this science, and hast fully mastered it: surely this will have its effect. My own case was precisely similar; and good poetry has never yet been wasted. Thou hast a goodly share in this art: thy verse is even and melodious, and is still improving. Wait and see the advantages which thou wilt reap from this science. For though Fortune should at first be grudging, matters will eventually turn out as thou wishest.\n\n\"My father Burh\u00e1n\u00ed, the Poet-laureate (may God be merciful to him!), passed away from this transitory to that eternal world in the town of Qazwin in the early part of the reign of Maliksh\u00e1h, entrusting me to the King in this verse, since then become famous:\u2014\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0645\u0646 \u0631\u0641\u062a\u0645 \u0648\u0641\u0631\u0632\u0646\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0622\u0645\u062f \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0645\u062f\u0646\u06cc\u060c \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0628\u062e\u062f\u0627 \u0648\u0628\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0633\u0631\u0645} \\]\n\n'I am flitting, but I leave a son behind me,\nAnd commend him to my God and to my King.'\n\n\"So my father's salary and allowances were transferred to me, and I became Maliksh\u00e1h's court-poet, and spent a year in the King's service; yet was I unable to see him save from a distance, nor did I get one din\u00e1r of my salary\n\n1 This verse, to which are added several others, is commonly ascribed to the Nidh\u00e1mul-Mulk, e.g. by D\u0101wlatsh\u00e1h (p. 54 of my forthcoming edition). Apart from the improbability that one who lay dying of a mortal wound would be in the mood to compose verses, we learn from this anecdote that the Nidh\u00e1mul-Mulk \"had no opinion of poets because he had no skill in their art.\" The verse which gives his age as 94 at the time of his death (he was actually 80 at most) is alone enough to discredit the story.\nor one maund of my allowances, while my expenditure was increased, I became involved in debt, and my brain was perplexed by my affairs. For that great Minister the Nidh\u00e1mu'l-Mulk (may God be merciful to him!) had no opinion of poets, because he had no skill in their art; nor did he pay any attention to any one of the religious leaders or mystics.\n\n\"One day\u2014it was the eve of the day on which the new moon of Ramad\u00e1n was due to appear, and I had not a farthing for all the expenses incidental to that month and the feast which follows it\u2014I went thus sad at heart to the Amir 'Ali Far\u00e1marz\u00b9 'Al\u00e1'u'd-Dawla, a man of royal parentage, a lover of poetry, and the intimate companion and son-in-law of the King, with whom he enjoyed the highest honour and before whom he could speak boldly, for he held high rank under that administration. And he had already been my patron. I said: 'May my lord's life be long! Not all that the father could do can the son do, nor does that which accrued to the father accrue to the son. My father was a bold and energetic man, and was sustained by his art, and the martyred King Alp Arsl\u00e1n, the lord of the world, entertained the highest opinion of him. But what he could do that can I not, for modesty forbids me. I have served this prince for a year, and have contracted debts to the extent of a thousand d\u00edn\u00e1rs, and have not received a farthing. Crave permission, then, for thy servant to go to Nish\u00e1p\u00far, and discharge his debts, and live on that which is left over, and express his gratitude to this victorious Dynasty.'\n\n\"'Thou speakest truly,' replied Am\u00edr 'Al\u00ed: 'we have all been at fault, but this shall be so no longer. The King, at the time of Evening Prayer, will go up to look for the moon. Thou must be present there, and we will see what Fortune will do.' Thereupon he at once ordered me to receive a hundred d\u00edn\u00e1rs to defray my Ramad\u00e1n expenses,\n\n\u00b9 Probably 'Ali b. Far\u00e1marz the Kikwayhid is intended. See Lane's Muhammedan Dynasties, p. 145.\nand a purse containing this sum in Nishapur coinage was forthwith brought and placed before me. So I returned mightily well pleased, and made my preparations for Ramad\u00e1n, and at the time of the second prayer went to the King's pavilion. It chanced that 'Al\u00e1'u'd-Dawla arrived at the very same moment, and I paid my respects to him. 'Thou hast done excellently well,' said he, 'and hast come punctually.' Then he dismounted and went in before the King.\n\n\"At sundown the King came forth from his pavilion, with a cross-bow in his hand and 'Al\u00e1'u'd-Dawla on his right hand.

To-morrow I will sit by the Minister until he writes a draft for his salary on Isfah\u00e1n, and orders his allowances to be paid out of the treasury.' Said the King: 'Thou must do it, then, for no one else has sufficient boldness. And call this poet after my title.' Now the King's title was Mu'izzu'd-Dunya wa'd-Din, so Amir 'Ali called me Mu'izz\u00ed. 'Amir Mu'izz\u00ed,' said the King, [correcting him]. And this noble lord was so zealous for me that next day, by the time of the first prayer, I had received a thousand din\u00e1rs as a gift, twelve hundred more as allowances, and an order for a thousand maunds of corn. And when the month of Ramad\u00e1n was past, he summoned me to a private audience, and caused me to become the King's boon-companion. So my fortune began to improve, and thenceforth he made enduring provision for me, and to-day whatever I have I possess by the favour of that Prince.

The Lady Zaynab was the special object of his panegyrics, and he enjoyed the fullest favour of the King, who was continually praising him and asserting his merits, so that Rashid\u012b\u2019s affairs prospered, the title of \u201cPrince of poets\u201d6 was conferred on him, he continued to rise higher in the King\u2019s opinion, and from him received gifts of great value.\n\nOne day, in Rashid\u012b\u2019s absence, the King asked \u2018Am\u2018aqq: \u201cWhat thinkest thou of the verse of Rashid\u012b, \u2018the Prince of poets\u2019?\u201d \u201cHis verse,\u201d replied he, \u201cis extremely good and chaste and correct, but it wants spice.\u201d\n\nAfter some while had elapsed, Rashid\u012b came in and did obeisance, and was about to sit down when the King called him before himself, and said, teasing him as is the way of kings: \u201cI asked the Poet-laureate just now, \u2018How is Rashid\u012b\u2019s poetry?\u2019 He replied that it was good, but wanted spice.

On this day he ordered Rash\u00edd\u00ed to receive all four trays, so he obtained the highest honour, and became famous. For just as a patron becomes famous by the verse of a good poet, so do poets likewise achieve renown by receiving a great reward from the king, these two things being interdependent.\n\nAnecdote xx.\n\nMaster Abu\u2019l-Q\u00e1s\u00edm Firdaws\u00ed\u00b2 was one of the Dihq\u00e1ns of T\u00fas, from a village called B\u00e1zh, in the district of\n\n\u00b9 A. \u0633\u06cc\u0645 \u0637\u0627\u0642 \u0648...\u061b B. ...\u0633\u06cc\u0645 \u0637\u0627\u0642 \u06cc\u0627...\u061b L. ...\u0633\u0645 \u0637\u0627\u0642 \u0648...\n\n\u00b2 This anecdote is cited by Ibn Isfandiyr in his History of Tabari\u0161t\u00edn (A.H. 613, A.D. 1216: see Kie\u00df\u2019s Persian catalogue, pp. 202\u2013204 and 533b), whence it was excerpted and published, with a German translation, by Eth\u00e9 (Z.D.M.G., vol. xlviii, pp. 89\u201394). It was also utilized by Noeldeke in his Iranische Nationalepos (Grundriss d. Iran. Philologie, vol. ii, p. 160 et seq.).\nTabar\u00e1n, a large village capable of supplying a thousand men. There Firdawsi enjoyed an excellent position, so that he was rendered quite independent of his neighbours by the income which he derived from his lands, and he had but one child, a daughter. His one desire in putting the Book of Kings (Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma) into verse was, out of the reward which he might obtain for it, to supply her with an adequate dowry. And to this end he left nothing undone, raising his verse as high as heaven, and causing it in sweet fluency to resemble running water. What genius, indeed, could raise verse to such a height as he does in the letter written by Z\u00e1l to S\u00e1m the son of Nar\u00edman in M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n, when he desired to ally himself with R\u00fad\u00e1ba the daughter of the King of K\u00e1b\u00fal:\n\n\"Then to S\u00e1m straightway sent he a letter,\nFilled with fair praises, prayers, and good greeting.\nFirst made he mention of the World-Maker,\nWho doom dispenseth and doom fulfillleth.\n\u2018On Nirum\u2019s son S\u00e1m,\u2019 wrote he, \u2018the scord-lord,\nMail-clad and mace-girt, may the Lord\u2019s peace rest!\nHurler of horse troops in hot-contested fights,\nFeeder of carrion-fouls with foemen\u2019s flesh-feast,\n\n1 A., B., L. all have \u201cTabarist\u00e1n.\u201d See, however, Noeldeke, loc. cit., p. 151.\n2 These verses, with some variants, will be found on pp. 124-5 of vol. i of Turner Macan\u2019s edition of the Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma (Calcutta, 1829).\nRaising the roar of strife on the red war-field,\nFrom the grim war-clouds grinding the gore-shoer.\nWho, by his manly might merit on merit\nHeaps, till his merit merit outmeasures.\"1\n\nIn eloquence I know of no poetry in Persian which equals this, and but little even in Arabic.\n\nWhen Firdawsi had completed the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, it was transcribed by \u2018Al\u00ed Daylam2 and recited by Ab\u00fa Dulaf,3 both of whom he mentions by name in tendering his thanks to Ha\u2019iy-i-Qu\u1e6dayba,4 the governor of T\u00fa\u0161, who had conferred on Firdawsi many favours:\n\n\"Of the men of renown of this city \u2018Al\u00ed Daylam and Ab\u00fa Dulaf have participated in this book.\n\nFrom them my portion was naught save 'Well done!'\nMy gall-bladder was like to burst with their 'Well dones.'\nHa\u2019iy the son of Qu\u1e6dayba is a nobleman who asks me not for unrewarded verse.\nI am cognizant neither of the principles nor the applications of tax-collecting;\nI lounge [at ease] in the midst of my quilt.\"5\n\n1 Poor as this rendering is, I am strongly of opinion that for an English rendering of the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma (which always seems to me very analogous in aim, scope, and treatment to that little-read English epic, the Brut of Layamou), the old English alliterative verse would be the most suitable form.\n2 See Noeldeke, loc. cit., p. 153, and n. 2 ad ca/c.\n3 So A. and L. B. has the more usual \"\u1e24usayn b. Qu\u1e6dayb.\" Cf. Noeldeke, loc. cit.\n4 I.e., I am sick of their barren and unprofitable plaudits. As these poor men rendered him material service in other ways, Firdawsi's remarks seem rather ungrateful.\n5 What follows is evidently an explanation of this couplet. Firdawsi means that being no longer vexed with the exactions of the tax-gatherer, he can now repose in peace.\nHa'iy the son of Qutayba was the revenue-collector of Tus, and deemed it his duty at least to abate the taxes payable by Firdawsi; hence naturally his name will endure till the Resurrection and kings will read it.\n\nSo 'Al\u00ed Daylam transcribed the Shahname in seven volumes, and Firdawsi, taking with him Ab\u00fa Dulaf, set out for Ghazna. There, by the help of the great Minister Ahmad \u1e24asan\u00b9 the secretary, he presented it, and it was accepted, Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad expressing himself as greatly indebted to his Minister. But the Prime Minister had enemies who were continually casting the dust of perturbation into the cup of his position, and Mahm\u00fad consulted with them as to what he should give Firdawsi. They replied: \"Fifty thousand dirhams, and even that is too much, seeing that he is in belief a R\u00e1fid\u00ed and a Mu'tazilite.

He was bitterly disappointed, went to the bath, and, on coming out, bought a drink of sherbet, and divided the money between the bath-man and the sherbet-seller. Knowing, however, Mahm\u00fad's severity, he fled from Ghazna, and alighted in Her\u00e1t at the shop of Azraq\u00ed's father, Isma'il the bookseller (Warr\u00e1q), where he remained in hiding for six months, until Mahm\u00fad's messengers had reached T\u00fas and had turned back thence, when Firdaws\u00ed, feeling secure, set out from Her\u00e1t for T\u00fas, taking the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma with him.

Next day Mahm\u00fad rode out with the\nPrime Minister on his right hand, for the ambassador had\nturned back and was coming to meet the king. 'I wonder,' said\nthe latter to the Minister, 'what answer he will have\ngiven?'

'You speak well,' said\nMahm\u00fad; 'I deeply regret that this noble man was\ndisappointed by me. Remind me at Ghazna to send him\nsomething.'\n\n\"So when the Sultan returned to Ghazna, the Minister\nreminded him; and Mahm\u00fad ordered Firdaws\u00ed to be given\nsixty thousand dinars' worth of indigo, and that this indigo should be carried to Tus on the King's own camels, and that apologies should be made to Firdawsi. For years the Minister had been working for this, and at length he had achieved his work; so now he caused the camels to be loaded, and the indigo arrived safely at Tabar\u00e1n.\u00b9 But as the camels were entering through the R\u00fadb\u00e1r Gate, the corpse of Firdawsi was being borne forth from the Gate of Raz\u00e1n.\u00b2 Now at this time there was in Tabar\u00e1n a preacher whose fanaticism was such that he declared that he would not suffer Firdawsi's body to be buried in the Musulm\u00e1n Cemetery, because he was a R\u00e1fid\u00ed; and nothing that men could say served to move this doctor. Now outside the gate there was a garden belonging to Firdawsi, and there they buried him, and there he lies to this day.\" And in the year A.H. 510 (A.D. 1116\u20131117) I visited his tomb.\u00b3\n\nThey say that Firdawsi left a daughter, of very lofty spirit, to whom they would have given the King's gift; but she would not accept it, saying, \"I need it not.\" The Post-master wrote to the Court and represented this to the King, who ordered that doctor to be expelled from Tabar\u00e1n as a punishment for his officiousness, and to be exiled from his home, and the money to be given to the Im\u00e1m Ab\u00fa Bakr Ish\u00e1q for the repair of the rest-house of Ch\u00e1ha,\u2074 which stands on the road between Merv and Nish\u00e1p\u00far on the boundaries of Tus. When this order reached Tus and Nish\u00e1p\u00far, it was faithfully carried out; and the restoration of the rest-house of Ch\u00e1ha was effected by this money.\n\n\u00b9 Tabar\u00e1n is the name of a portion of the city of Tus.

There are several places called R\u00fadb\u00e1r, of which one situated near Tabar\u00e1n is probably meant. See B. de Meynard's Dict. de la Perse, p. 266. A Raz\u00e1n in S\u00edst\u00e1n is mentioned by Edalluri (pp. 396 397), and another (\u0631\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0622\u0646) in the district of Nas\u00e1 in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n.

Now on the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast one of the nobles of the city of Balkh (may God maintain its prosperity!), Amir \u2018Amid Safiyyu\u2019d-Din Ab\u00fa Bakr Muhammad b. al-Husayn Raw\u00e1ns\u00e1b\u00ed, came to the Court. He was a young man, an expert writer, a qualified Secretary of State, well endowed with culture and its fruits, popular with all, whose praises were on all tongues. And at this time I was not in attendance.\n\nNow at a reception the King chanced to say, \u201cCall Nidh\u00e1m\u00ed.\u201d Said the Amir \u2018Am\u00edd Safiyyu\u2019d-D\u00edn, \u201cIs Nidh\u00e1m\u00ed here?\u201d They answered \u201cYes.\u201d But he supposed that it was Nidh\u00e1m\u00ed-i-Mun\u00edr\u00ed. \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201ca fine poet and a man of wide fame!\u201d When the messenger arrived to summon me, I put on my shoes, and, as I entered, did obeisance, and sat down in my place.

Then Amir \u2018Am\u00edd perceived that\n\n1 L. adds \u2018ibn.\u2019\n2 The reading of this nisba is very doubtful in all three texts, both here and lower.

The principles thereof are contained in the book of the \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd, and the applications in the \"Supplement\" (Takmila) of Ab\u00fa Mans\u00far of Baghdad, and the \"Hundred Chapters\" (\u1e62ad B\u00e1b) of as-Sajz\u00ed.\n\n---\n\n1 See Rieu's Persian Catalogue, pp. 451-2, where a MS. of the Persian version of this work, dated A.H. 685 (A.D. 1286), is described.\n\n2 I suppose that this is the meaning of \u1e0d\u00e1j\u00e1 in the text.\n\n3 I take this to be the sense of L.'s reading: \u0643\u0647 \u0646\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0646 \u0642\u0631\u0648\u062f \u062f\u0633\u062a\u06cc\n\n4 A. adds \u0648 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u0647\u0631 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0641\u0633 \u062e\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0634\n\nConcerning Th\u00e1bit b.

It includes a knowledge of the Al-Magest and the best of its commentaries and elucidations, which are the Commentary of Tabr\u00edz\u00ed\\(^2\\) and the Al-Magest of Sh\u00edf\u00e1. And amongst the applications of this science is the science of the Calendar and of Almanacs.\n\nJudicial Astrology is a branch of Natural Science, and its special use is prognostication, by which is meant the deducing by analogy from configurations, and from an estimation of the degrees and zodiacal signs and their influences, those events which are brought about by their movements, in respect to the condition of the cycles of the world, politics, cities, nativities, changes, transitions, decisions, and other questions; and it is contained in these five [books] which we have enumerated, to wit, the writings of Ab\u00fa Ma'shar of Balkh,\\(^3\\) Ahmad 'Abdu'l-Jal\u00edl-i-Sajzi, Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n B\u00eer\u00fani, and G\u00fbshy\u00e1r-i-J\u00edl\u00ed.\\(^4\\)\n\nSo the Astrologer must be a man of acute mind, approved character, and great natural intelligence. And one of the essentials of this art is that the astrologer who would pronounce prognostications should possess in his own horoscope the Share of the Unseen, and that the Lord of the House of this Share of the Unseen should be lucky, and in a favourable position, in order that such pronouncements as he gives may be near the truth.

Then he bent his knees and studied for fifteen years, until he reached that eminence which he reached in Astrology.\n\n*Aneadote xxiii.*\n\nIt is stated that once when Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad b. N\u00e1siru'd-D\u00edn\\(^2\\) was sitting on the roof of a four-doored summer-house in Ghazna, in the Garden of a Thousand Trees, he turned his face to Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n\\(^3\\) and said, \u201cBy which of these four doors shall I go out?\u201d (for all four were practicable) \u201cDecide, and write the decision on a piece of paper, and put it under my quilt.\u201d Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n called for an astrolabe, took the altitude, worked out the ascendant, reflected for a while, and then wrote down his decision on a piece of paper, and placed it under the quilt. \u201cHast thou decided?\u201d asked Mahm\u00fad. He answered, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThen Mahm\u00fad bade them make an opening in the wall, and they brought mattocks and spades, and in the wall which was on the eastern side dug out a fifth door, through which he went out. Then he bade them bring the paper. So they brought it, and on it was written: \u201cHe will go out through none of these four doors, but they will dig a fifth door on the side of the eastern wall, by which door he will go forth.\u201d Mahm\u00fad, on reading this, was furious, and bade them cast Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n down from the midst of the palace. So they did even as he had said. Now\n\n\\(^1\\) See Brockelmann\u2019s *Gesch. d. Arab. Litteratur*, pp. 221, 222.\n\\(^2\\) i.e. the great Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad of Ghazna (reigned A.H. 388-421, A.D. 998-1030).\n\\(^3\\) i.e. the celebrated al-Bir\u00fani, of whom mention has been already made.\na net had been stretched here to keep off the flies, and on it Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n fell. The net tore, and he subsided gently to the ground, so that he received no injury. \"Bring him in,\" said Mahm\u00fad. So they brought him in, and Mahm\u00fad said: \"O Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n, didst thou know this?\" \"I knew it, sire,\" he answered, and, taking the Almanac from the servant, produced the prognostications out of the Almanac; and amongst the predictions for that day was written: \"To-day they will cast me down from a high place, but I shall reach the earth in safety, and arise sound in body.\"\n\nAll this was not according to Mahm\u00fad's mind. He waxed still angrier, and ordered Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n to be detained in the citadel. So Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n was confined in the citadel of Ghazna, where he remained for six months. It is said that during that period of six months none dared speak to Mahm\u00fad about Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n, one of whose servants was, however, deputed to wait upon him, and to go out to get what he wanted, and to return therewith. One day this servant was passing through the Park of Ghazna, when a fortune-teller called to him and said, \"I perceive several things worth mentioning in your fortune: give me a present, that I may reveal them to you.\" The servant gave him two dirhams, whereupon the soothsayer said: \"One dear to thee is in affliction, but ere three days are past he will be delivered from that affliction, will be invested with a robe of honour, and will again be loaded with honours and favours.\"\n\nThe servant proceeded to the citadel, and told this incident to his master as a piece of good tidings.\n\n---\n\n1 This seems to be the meaning of L.'s reading: \u0645\u06af\u0631 \u0631\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u06af\u0633 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0646\u062f.

Thou hast informed me too late.\" It is said that the Prime Minister Ahmad Hasan of Maymand (may God be merciful to him!) was for six months seeking an opportunity to say a word on behalf of Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n. At length, when engaged in the chase, he found the King in a good humour, and, working from one topic to another, he brought the conversation round to Astrology. Then he said: \"Poor Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n uttered two such good prognostications, and instead of decorations and a robe of honour obtained bonds and imprisonment.\" \"Know, my lord,\" replied Mahm\u00fad, \"for I have proved it, that this man is said to have no equal in the world save Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed S\u00edn\u00e1 (Avicenna), but both his prognostications were opposed to my will; and kings are like little children\u2014in order to receive rewards from them, one should speak in accordance with their opinion. It would have been better for him on that day if one of those two prognostications had been wrong. But to-morrow order him to be brought forth, and to be given a horse caparisoned with gold, a royal robe, a satin turban, a thousand din\u00e1rs, a slave, and a handmaiden.\"\n\nSo, on the very day specified by the soothsayer, they brought forth Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n, and the gift of honour detailed above was conferred upon him, and the King apologized to him, saying: \"If thou desirest always to reap advantage from me, speak according to my desire, not according to the dictates of thy science.\" So thereafter Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n altered his practice; and this is one of the conditions of the service of kings, that one must be with them in right or wrong, and speak according to their wish.\n\nNow when Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n reached his house, the learned\n\n1 Instead of this sentence A. has: \"Thou hast wasted two dirhams.\"\n2 I follow L., which reads: \"\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0648 \u0645\u0646 \u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0645\" A. has: \"\u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u06c1 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0645\"\n3 A. omits this simile.\ncame to congratulate him. He related to them the incident of the soothsayer, whereat they were amazed, and sent to summon him. They found him most illiterate, knowing nothing. Then Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n said, \"Hast thou the horoscope of thy nativity?\" \"I have,\" replied he. Then Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n examined it, and the Share of the Unseen fell directly on the degree of his Ascendant,\\(^1\\) so that whatever he said, though he spoke blindly, came near to the truth.\n\n**Anecdote xxiv.**\n\nI had in my employment a woman-servant, who was born on the 28th of Safar, A.H. 510\\(^2\\) (= July 12th, A.D. 1116), when the Moon was in conjunction with the Sun and there was no distance between them, so that both the Share of Fortune and the Share of the Unseen fell on the degree of the Ascendant. When she reached the age of fifteen years, I taught her Astrology, in which she became so skilful that she could answer difficult questions in this science, and her prognostications came very near the truth. Ladies used to come to her and question her, and the most part of what she said coincided with the pre-ordained decrees of fate.\n\nOne day an old woman came and said: \"It is now four years since a son of mine went on a journey, and I have no news of him, neither of his life nor of his death. See whether, wherever he may be, he is of the living or the dead.\" So the woman-astrologer arose, took the altitude, worked out the degree of the Ascendant, drew out an astrological table, and determined the positions of the stars; and the very first words she said were, \"Thy son hath returned!\"\n\nThe old woman was annoyed and said: \"O child, I have no hopes of my son's coming: tell me this much, is he alive or dead?\"\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u064a\u0628\u0634 \u0628\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u0686 \u062f\u0631\u062c\u0647\u060c \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0639 \u0627\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f...\n\n\\(^2\\) A. has \"512.\"\n\"I tell you,\" said the other, \"thy son hath come. Go, and, if he hath not come, return, that I may tell thee how he is.\"\n\nSo the old woman went to her house, and lo! her son had arrived and was unloading his asses. She embraced him, took off her veil, and came back to the woman-astrologer, saying, \"Thou didst speak truly; my son hath come, bringing presents\"; and she gave her her blessing. When I came home and heard tidings of this, I enquired of her, \"By what didst thou speak, and from what House didst thou deduce this prognostication?\" She answered: \"I had not reached so far as this. When I had finished the figure of the Ascendant, he came in and sat down on the letter of the degree of the Ascendant, wherefore it so seemed in my mind, that this young man had returned. When I said so, and the mother had gone to find out, it became so certain to me that it was as though I actually saw him unloading his asses.\"\n\nThen I perceived that it was the Share of the Unseen, and nothing else but this, which thus influenced the degree of the Ascendant.\n\nAnecdote xxv.\n\nMahm\u00fad D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed, the son of Abu'l-Q\u00e1sim D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed, was a great fool, nay, almost a madman, and had no considerable knowledge as to the actions of the stars; yet he could cast a nativity, and in his notebook were figures declaring \"it is\" or \"it is not.\" He was in the service of Am\u00edr D\u00e1'\u00fad Ab\u00fa Bakr Mas'\u00fad at Panj-dih; and his prognostications generally came right.\n\nNow his madness was such that when my master the King of the Mountains sent him a pair of Gh\u00far\u00ed dogs, very large and formidable, he fought with them of his own free-will, and escaped from them in safety. Years afterwards we were sitting with a number of persons of learning in the Perfumers' Market at Her\u00e1t, in the shop of Muqri\nthe surgeon-druggist,\u00b9 and discussing all manner of subjects. One of these learned men happening to remark, \"What a great man was Avicenna (Ibn S\u00edn\u00e1)!\" I saw D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed fly into a passion, all the possession of anger appearing in and overcoming him, and he cried: \"O so-and-so, who was Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed? I regard myself as equal in worth to a thousand Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed's, for he never even fought with a cat, whilst I fought before Am\u00edr D\u00e1'\u00fad with two dogs.\" So on that day I knew him to be mad; yet for all his madness I witnessed the following occurrence.\n\nIn the year A.H. 505\u00b2 (A.H. 1111\u20131112), when Sul\u1e6d\u00e1n Sanjar encamped in the Plain of Kh\u00faz\u00e1n,\u00b3 on his way to Transoxania to fight with Mu\u1e25ammad,\u2074 Am\u00edr D\u00e1'\u00fad attached himself to the King, and made a great entertainment for him. On the third day the King came to the river-brink, and entered a boat to amuse himself with fishing. In the boat he summoned D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed before him to talk after the manner of madmen, while he laughed, for D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed would openly abuse Am\u00edr D\u00e1'\u00fad.\n\nPresently the King said to him, \"Prognosticate how many maunds the fish which I shall catch this time will weigh.\" D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed said, \"Draw up your hook.\" So the king drew it up; and he took the altitude, paused for a while, and then said, \"Now cast it.\" The King cast, and he said, \"I prognosticate that this fish which you will draw out will weigh five maunds.\" \"O knave,\" said Am\u00edr D\u00e1'\u00fad, \"whence should fish of five maunds' weight come into this stream?\" \"Be silent,\" said D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed; \"what do you know about it?\" So Am\u00edr D\u00e1'\u00fad was silent, fearing that, should he insist further, he would only get abuse.\n\n\u00b9 The readings differ here.

He reigned A.H. 498\u2013511 (A.D. 1104\u20131117).\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1899.\nSuddenly there was a pull on the line, indicating that a fish had been taken captive. The King drew in the line with a very large fish on it, which, when weighed, scaled five\\(^1\\) maunds. All were amazed, and expressed their astonishment. \"D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed,\" said the King, \"what dost thou wish for?\" \"O King,\" said he with an obeisance, \"of all that is on this earth I desire but a coat of mail, a shield, and a spear, that I may do battle with B\u00e1ward\u00ed.\" And this Ab\u00e1ward\u00ed was the Captain of Am\u00edr D\u00e1'\u00fad's gate, and D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed entertained towards him a fanatical hatred, because the title of Shuj\u00e1'u'l-Mulk had been conferred upon him, while D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed himself bore the title of Shuj\u00e1'u'l-Hukam\u00e1, and grudged that the other should be so entitled. And the Am\u00edr, well knowing this, used continually to embroil D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed with him, and this good Musulm\u00e1n was at his wits' end by reason of him.\n\nIn short, as to Ma\u1e25m\u00fad D\u00e1'\u00fad\u00ed's madness there was no doubt, and I have mentioned this matter in order that the King may know that folly and insanity are amongst the conditions of this craft.\n\n**Anecdote xxvi.**\n\nHak\u00edm-i-Maws\u00edl\u00ed was one of the order of Astrologers in N\u00edsh\u00e1pur, and was in the service of that great Minister Nidh\u00e1m\u00fa'l-Mulk of T\u00fas, who used to consult with him on matters of importance, and seek his advice and opinion. Now when Mawsili's years were drawing to a close, and great decrepitude appeared in him, and feebleness of body began to show itself, so that he was no longer able to perform these long journeys, he asked the Minister's permission to go and reside at N\u00edsh\u00e1pur, and to send thence annually the almanac and forecast for the year.\n\nNow the Minister Nidh\u00e1m\u00fa'l-Mulk was also in the decline of life and near the term of existence; and he said: \"Look\n\n\\(^1\\) A. has \"six.\"\nso much at the lapse of my life as to observe when the dissolution of my elemental nature will occur, and at what epoch that inevitable fate and unavoidable sentence will befall.\"\n\nHakim-i-Mawsili answered, \"Six months after my death.\" So the Minister ordered him to receive all things needful for his comfort, and Mawsili went to Nishapur, and there abode in ease, sending each year the forecast and calendar. And whoever came to the Minister from Nishapur, he used first to enquire, \"How is Mawsili?\" And so soon as he had news of his safety, he would become joyous and cheerful.\n\nAt length, in the year A.H. 485 (= A.D. 1092\u20133), one arrived from Nishapur, and the Minister enquired of him concerning Mawsili. The man replied, with an obeisance: \"May he who holdeth the chief seat in al-Islam be the heir of many lifetimes! Mawsili hath quitted this mortal body.\" \"When?\" enquired the Minister. \"In the middle of Rab\u012b' the First\" (April 11\u2013May 11, A.D. 1092), answered the man, \"he yielded up his life for him who sitteth in the chief seat of al-Islam.\"\n\nThe Minister thereat was mightily put about, and was warned, and looked into all his affairs, and confirmed all his pious endowments, and gave effect to his bequests, and wrote his last testament, and set free such of his slaves as had earned his approval, and discharged the debts which he owed, and, so far as lay in his power, made all men content with him, and sought forgiveness from his adversaries, and made his will, and so sat awaiting his fate until the month of Ramad\u0101n (A.H. 485 = Oct. 5\u2013Nov. 4, A.D. 1092), when he fell a martyr at the hands of that Sect (i.e. the Assassins); may God make illustrious his Proof, and accord him an ample Approval!\n\nSince the Ascendant ruling his nativity, the observation, the Lord of the Sign, and the dominant factor were rightly\n\n---\n\n1 A., which I follow, has: \u0627\u062f\u0631\u0627\u06a9\u0627\u062a\u0631\u0627 (\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0627) \u062a\u0648\u0642\u06cc\u0639 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u060c\ndetermined, and the Astrologer was expert and accomplished, naturally the prognostication came true.\\footnote{I confess that these astrological terms are beyond me. Several of them (e.g., \\textit{huyu} and \\textit{kadhada}) are explained in the section of the \\textit{Mafatihu'l-'ulum} which treats of Astrology (ed. Van Vloten, pp. 225-232). The first part of the sentence runs:}\n\n\\textbf{Anecdote xxvii.}\n\nIn the year A.H. 506 (A.D. 1112-1113) Khw\u00e1ja Im\u00e1m 'Umar Khayy\u00e1m\\footnote{A. and B. have \\textit{Khayyami}, the form usually found in Arabic books.} and Khw\u00e1ja Im\u00e1m Mudhaffar-i-Isf\u00edz\u00e1ri had alighted in the city of Balkh, in the street of the Slave-sellers, in the house of Am\u00edr Ab\u00fa Sa'd,\\footnote{A. adds \\textit{\u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0651\u0627\u062f}, while B. calls him \\textit{\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u0633\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u062f \u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062f\u064e}.} and I had joined that assembly. In the midst of our convivial gathering I heard that Argument of Truth (\\textit{Hujjatu'l-Haqq}) 'Umar say, \"My grave will be in a spot where the trees will shed their blossoms on me twice in each year.\" This thing seemed to me impossible, though I knew that one such as he would not speak idle words.\n\nWhen I arrived at Nish\u00e1p\u00far in the year A.H. 530 (A.D. 1135-6), it being then some years since that great man had veiled his countenance in the dust, and this lower world had been bereaved of him, I went to visit his grave on the eve of a Friday (seeing that he had the claim of a master on me), taking with me a guide to point out to me his tomb. So he brought me out to the H\u00edra\\footnote{So A., B., and L., but in the margin of the latter is the following gloss: \\textit{\u062d\u0650\u0632\u064e\u0631\u064e \u062c\u064e\u0648\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e \u0627\u06cc\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u064e \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0642 (\u0628\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0646)}.} Cemetery; I turned to the left, and his tomb lay at the foot of a garden-wall, over which pear-trees and peach-trees thrust their heads, and on his grave had fallen so many flower-leaves that his dust was hidden beneath the flowers. Then I remembered that saying which I had heard from him...\nin the city of Balkh, and I fell to weeping, because on the face of the earth, and in all the regions of the habitable globe, I nowhere saw one like unto him. May God (blessed and exalted is He) have mercy upon him,\\(^1\\) by His Grace and His Favour! Yet although I witnessed this prognostication on the part of that Proof of the Truth \u2018Umar, I did not observe that he had any great belief in astrological predictions; nor have I seen or heard of any of the great [scientists] who had such belief.\\(^2\\)\n\n**Anecdote xxviii.**\n\nIn the winter of the year A.H. 508 (= A.D. 1114\u20131115) the King sent a messenger to Merv to the Prime Minister Sadru\u2019d-D\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad b. al-Mud\u1e25affar (on whom be God\u2019s Mercy) bidding him tell Khw\u00e1ja Im\u00e1m \u2018Umar to select a favourable time for him to go hunting, such that therein should be no snowy or rainy days. For Khw\u00e1ja Im\u00e1m \u2018Umar was in the Minister\u2019s company, and used to lodge at his house.\n\nSo the Minister sent a messenger to summon him, and told him what had happened. The Khw\u00e1ja went and looked into the matter for two days, and made a careful choice; and he himself went and superintended the mounting of the King at the auspicious moment. When the King was mounted and had gone but a short distance,\\(^3\\) the sky became overcast with clouds, a wind arose, and snow and mist supervened. All present fell to laughing, and the King desired to turn back; but Khw\u00e1ja Im\u00e1m [\u2018Umar] said: \u201cHave no anxiety, for this very hour the clouds will clear away, and during these five days there will be not a drop of moisture.\u201d So the King rode on, and the clouds\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A. has: \u201ccause him to dwell in Paradise.\u201d\n\n\\(^2\\) L. omits this last sentence.\n\n\\(^3\\) I suppose this to be the meaning of the words: \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u062c\u064f \u0632\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064c \u064a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064f\u062a\u064e, which is the reading of all three texts.\nopened, and during those five days there was no moisture, and no one saw a cloud.\n\nBut prognostication by the stars, though a recognized art, is not to be relied on, and whatever the astrologer predicts he must leave to Fate.\n\nAnecdote xxix.\n\nIt is incumbent on the King, wherever he goes, to prove such companions and servants as he has with him; and if one is a believer in the Holy Law, and scrupulously observes the rites and duties thereof, he should make him an intimate, and treat him with honour, and confide in him; but if otherwise, he should drive him away, and guard even the outskirts of his environment from his very shadow. Whoever does not believe in the religion and law of Mu\u1e25ammad the Chosen One, in him can no man trust, and he is unlucky, both to himself and to his master.\n\nIn the beginning of the reign of the king Sult\u00e1n Ghiy\u00e1thu'd-Duny\u00e1 wa'd-D\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad b. Maliksh\u00e1h, styled Qas\u00edmu Am\u00edri'l-M\u00faminin (may God illuminate his proof!)\\(^1\\) the King of the Arabs, Sadaqa,\\(^2\\) revolted and withdrew his neck from the yoke of allegiance, and with fifty thousand Arab horsemen marched on Baghdad from Hilla. The Prince of Believers al-Mustadhir bi'll\u00e1h had sent off letter after letter and courier after courier to Isfah\u00e1n,\\(^3\\) summoning the Sultan, who sought from the astrologers the determination of the auspicious moment. But no such determination could be made which would suit the Lord of the King's Ascendant, which was retrograde. So they said, \"We find no auspicious moment.\" \"Seck it, then,\" said he; and he was very urgent in the matter, and much vexed in mind. And so the astrologers fled.\n\n\\(^1\\) Reigned A.H. 498-511, A.D. 1104-1117.\n\\(^2\\) Cf. Houtsma's ed. of al-Bundari's History of the Seljuqs, p. 186, where an Amir of this name is mentioned under the year A.H. 531.\n\\(^3\\) A. calls it Sipahdn.\nNow there was a stranger of Jayy\\(^1\\) who had a shop by the Gate of the Dome and who used to take omens; and men and women of every class used to visit him, and he used to write for them amulets and charms, but he had no profound knowledge. By means of an acquaintance with one of the King's servants he brought himself to the King's notice, and said: \"I will find an auspicious moment: depart in that, and if thou dost not return victorious, then cut off my head.\"\n\nSo the King was pleased, and mounted his horse at the moment declared auspicious by him, and gave him two hundred dinars of Nishap\u00fbr, and went forth, fought with \u0160adaqa, defeated his army, took him captive, and put him to death. And when he returned triumphant and victorious to Isfah\u00e1n, he heaped favours on the soothsayer, ordered him to receive great honours, and made him one of his intimates. Then he summoned the astrologers and said: \"You did not find an auspicious moment, it was this stranger of Jayy who found it; and I went, and God justified the omen.\\(^2\\) Probably \u0160adaqa had sent you a bribe so that you should not name the auspicious time.\" Then they all fell to the earth, lamenting and exclaiming: \"The astrologers were not satisfied with that moment. If you wish, write a message and send it to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and see what Khw\u00e1ja Im\u00e1m 'Umar Khayy\u00e1m says.\"\n\nThe King saw that the poor wretches did not speak amiss. He therefore summoned one of his courtiers and said: \"Invite this stranger of Jayy\\(^3\\) to your house, drink wine with him, and treat him with kindly familiarity; and, when he is overcome with wine, enquire of him, saying,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A suburb of Isfah\u00e1n, as is explained in a marginal gloss in L., which has this reading: \u063a\u0631\u06cc\u0628 \u062c\u06cc (printed in the text as one word, \u063a\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u200c\u062c\u06cc). A. reads \u063a\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u200c\u062c\u06cc and B. \u063a\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u200c\u062c\u06cc.\n\n\\(^2\\) A. adds \"Wherefore did ye act thus?\"\n\n\\(^3\\) L. is constant in this reading, but here A. has \u063a\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u200c\u062c\u06cc \u0631\u0627 and B. \u063a\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u200c\u062c\u06cc \u0631\u0627.\n'Was that moment determined by thee not good? For the astrologers find fault with it. Tell me the secret of this.'\n\nThen the courtier did so, and, when his guest was drunk, made this enquiry of him. The soothsayer answered: \"I knew that one of two things must happen; either that army would be defeated, or this one. If the former, then I should be loaded with honours; and if the latter, how should the King concern himself with me?\"\n\nNext day the courtier reported this conversation to the King, who ordered the strange soothsayer to be expelled, because one who held such views about good Musulm\u00e1ns was unlucky. Then\u00b9 the King summoned his own astrologers and restored his confidence to them, saying: \"I knew that this soothsayer never said his prayers, and one who agrees not with our Holy Law agrees not with us.\"\n\nAnecdote xxx.\n\nIn the year A.H. 547 (A.D. 1152\u20133) a battle was fought between that king of blessed memory Sanjar b.

So next day I came and said: \u201cTo-morrow at the time of the first prayer the messenger will arrive.\u201d All that night the Prince was thinking about this matter.

And no physician can be of tender disposition if he fails to recognize the nobility of man; nor of philosophical nature unless he knows Logic, nor an acute observer unless he be strengthened by God's guidance; and he who is not an acute observer will not arrive at a correct understanding of the cause of any ailment, for he must form his opinion from the pulse, which has a systole, a diastole, and a pause between these two movements.\n\nNow here there is a difference of opinion amongst physicians, one school maintaining that it is impossible by palpation to gauge the movement of contraction; but\n\n\\(^1\\) For \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0647\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 A. has \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0647\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629.\nthat most accomplished of the moderns, that talented man Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed al-Husayn b. \u2018Abdu\u2019ll\u00e1h S\u00edn\u00e1 (Avicenna), says in his book the Q\u00e1n\u00fan that the movement of contraction also can be gauged, though with difficulty, in thin subjects; and that the pulse is of two sorts, each of which is divided into three subordinate varieties, namely, its two extremes and its mean; but, unless the Divine guidance assist the physician in his search for the truth, his thought will not hit the mark. So also the examination of the urine, and the observing of its colour and peculiarities, and the deducing somewhat from each colour, is no easy matter; for these deductions are dependent on Divine help and Heavenly guidance; and this is the quality which we have already mentioned under the name of acumen. And unless the physician knows Logic, and understands the meaning of species and genus, he cannot discriminate between that which appertains to the category and that which is peculiar to the individual, and so will not recognize the cause of the disease. And, failing to recognize the cause, he will not succeed in his treatment. But let us now give an illustration, so that it may be known that it is as we say. Disease is the genus; fever, cold, headache, dizziness, scarlet fever, and jaundice are the species, each of which is distinguished from the others by a diagnostic sign, while each itself is again divisible into varieties. For instance, \u2018Fever\u2019 is the genus, wherein quotidian, tertian, double tertian, quartan, and the sub-varieties of each, are distinguished from each other by a special diagnostic sign, so that, for instance, quotidian is distinguished from other\n\n1 See De Slane's translation of Ibn Khallik\u00e1n, vol. i, pp. 440-446; von Kremer's Culturgeschichte d.

Three days elapsed. At the time of evening prayer I returned, thinking that the patient would pass away at midnight. I went up on to the roof, but could hardly sleep for anxiety. In the morning when I awoke I said to myself, 'The patient will have passed away.' I turned my face in that direction, but heard no sound [of lamentation] which might indicate his passing. I repeated the F\u0101ti\u1e25a, and hastened in that direction, saying: 'O my God and my Lord, Thou Thyself hast said in the Sure Book and Indubitable Scripture, \"And we send down in the Qur'\u0101n what is a Healing and a Mercy to true believers.\"'\n\nFor I was filled with regret, seeing that he was a young man, and in easy circumstances. Then I performed the minor ablution, went to the oratory, and repeated the customary prayer. One knocked at the door of the house. When I went to look who was there, it was one of his household, who gave good tidings, saying, 'He hath passed out of danger'; and, on my enquiring when, added, 'Just now he obtained relief.' Then I knew that the patient had been relieved by the blessing of the F\u0101ti\u1e25a of the Scripture, and that this draught had been dispensed from the Divine Dispensary. For I have put this to the proof, administering this draught in many cases, in all of which it proved beneficial, and resulted in restoration to health.\"\n\nTherefore the physician should be of good faith, and should venerate the commands and prohibitions of the Holy Law.

For what right has anyone to find fault with so great a man, when the very first question which he meets with in a book of his which he comes across is difficult to his comprehension? For four thousand years the physicians of antiquity travailed in spirit and melted their very souls in order to reduce the science of Medicine to some fixed order, yet could not effect this, until, after the lapse of this period, that absolute philosopher and most mighty thinker Aristotle portioned and parcelled out Logic and Philosophy as in a balance, and measured them by the measure of analogy, so that all doubt and ambiguity departed from them, and they were established on a sure and critical basis. And during these fifteen centuries which have elapsed since his time, no philosopher has won to the inmost essence of his doctrine, nor travelled the high road of his pre-eminence, save that most excellent of the moderns, the Philosopher of the East and the West, the Proof of Isl\u00e1m, Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed b. \u2018Abdu\u2019ll\u00e1h b.

Now one of the children of H\u0101shim, a kinsman of al-Ma'm\u016bn, was attacked with dysentery, and al-Ma'm\u016bn, being greatly attached to him, sent Bukht-Yish\u016b' to treat him. So he, for al-Ma'm\u016bn's sake, girded up his loins in service, and treated him in various ways, but to no purpose, for the case passed beyond his powers. So Bukht-Yish\u016b' was ashamed before al-Ma'm\u016bn; but al-Ma'm\u016bn said to him: \"Be not ashamed, for thou didst fulfil thine utmost endeavour, but God Almighty doth not desire that it should succeed. Acquiesce in Fate, even as we have acquiesced.\" Bukht-Yish\u016b', seeing al-Ma'm\u016bn thus hopeless, replied: \"One other remedy remains, and it is a perilous one; but, trusting to the fortune of the Prince of Believers, I will attempt it, and perchance God Most High may cause it to succeed.\"\n\n1 See \u1e24\u0101ji Khal\u012bfa, No. 4738.\n2 See W\u00fcstenfeld, op. cit., p. 95, No. 165.

So Bukht-Yish\u00fa' prepared a purgative and administered it to him; and on the day whereon he took the purgative, his diarrhoea was still further increased; but next day it stopped. So the physicians asked him, \"What hazardous treatment was that which thou didst adopt yesterday?\" He answered: \"The materies morbi of this diarrhoea was from the brain, and until it was dislodged from the brain the flux would not cease. I feared that if I administered a purgative the patient's strength might not be equal to the increased diarrhoea; but at length, when I plucked up heart, [I saw that] there was hope in giving the purgative, but none in withholding it. So I gave it, and God Most High vouchsafed a cure; and my opinion was justified, namely, that if the purgative were withheld, only the death of the patient was to be expected; but that if it were administered, there was a possibility of either life or death. Therefore, seeing that to give the purgative was the better course, I administered it.\"\n\nAnecdote xxxiii.\n\nThe great Shaykh Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed S\u00edn\u00e1 (Avicenna) relates as follows in the \"Book of the Origin and the Return\" (Kit\u00e1b\u00fa'l-Mabd\u00e1 wa'l-Ma'\u0101d), at the end of the section on Contingent Being:\n\n\"A curious anecdote hath come to me which I have heard related.

Here was no opportunity for any physical method of treatment, since for such no appliances were available. So the physician bethought himself of a psychical treatment, and bade them remove the veil from her head, whereon she made a movement.

I bade them uncover her head, that perchance she might be ashamed, and might make some movement because this condition was displeasing to her. So the whole of her head and face was uncovered, and anger was apparent therein.\\(^4\\) I then abandoned this, and ordered her skirt to be removed.

N\u00fah b. Na\u1e63r,\\(^2\\) became afflicted with an ailment which grew chronic, and remained established, and the physicians were unable to cure it. So the Am\u00edr Mans\u00far sent messengers to summon Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u00e1 of Ray to treat him. Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u00e1 came as far as the Oxus, but when he saw it he said: \"I will not embark in the boat: God Most High saith, 'Do not cast yourselves into peril with your own hands'\\(^3\\); and, again, it is surely a thing remote from wisdom voluntarily to place one's self in so hazardous a position.\" Ere the Am\u00edr's messenger had gone to Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1 and returned, he had composed the treatise entitled *Mans\u00fari*.\\(^4\\) So when a notable arrived with a special led-horse, bringing a message intermingled with promises of reward, he handed this *Mans\u00fari* to him, saying: \"I am this book, and by this book thou canst attain thine object, so that there is no need of me.\"\n\nWhen the book reached the Am\u00edr he was in grievous suffering, wherefore he sent a thousand d\u00edn\u00e1rs and one of his own private horses, saying: \"Strive to move him by all these kind attentions, but, if they prove fruitless, bind his hands and feet, place him in the boat, and fetch him across.\" So, just as the Am\u00edr had commanded, they urgently entreated Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u00e1, but to no purpose. Then they bound his hands and feet, placed him in the boat, and, when they had ferried him across the river, released him. Then they brought the led-horse, fully caparisoned, before him, and he mounted in the best\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) So L., which reads \u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u06cc\u0647, but A. has \u0637\u0628\u0639\u06cc\u0647, \"human nature.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) That is, Mans\u00far I, who reigned A.H. 350-366 (A.D. 961-976). This anecdote is given in the *Akhl\u00e1q-i-Jal\u00e1l\u00ed* (ed. Lucknow, A.H. 1283), pp. 169-170.\n\n\\(^3\\) Qur'\u00e1n, ii. v. 191.\n\n\\(^4\\) See n. 1 on p. 316 supra.\nof humours, and set out for Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1. And when they enquired of him, saying, \"We feared to bring thee across the water lest thou shouldst cherish enmity against us, but thou didst not so, nor do we see thee vexed in heart,\" he replied: \"I know that every year several thousand persons cross the Oxus without being drowned, and that I too should probably not be drowned; still, it was possible that I might perish, and if this had happened they would have continued till the Resurrection to say, 'A foolish fellow was Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u00e1, in that, of his own free will, he embarked in a boat and so was drowned.' But when they bound me, I escaped all danger of censure; for then they would say, 'They bound the poor fellow's hands and feet, so that he was drowned.' Thus should I have been excused, not blamed, in case of my being drowned.\"\n\nWhen they reached Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1, he saw the Am\u00edr and began to treat him, exerting his powers to the utmost, but without relief to the patient. One day he came in before the Am\u00edr and said: \"To-morrow I am going to try another method of treatment, but for the carrying out of it you will have to sacrifice such-and-such a horse and such-and-such a mule,\" the two being both animals of note, so that in one night they had gone forty parasangs.\n\nSo next day he took the Am\u00edr to the hot bath of J\u00fa-yi-M\u00faliy\u00e1n, outside the palace, leaving that horse and mule ready equipped and tightly girt in the charge of his own servant; while of the King's retinue and attendants he suffered not one to enter the bath. Then he brought the King into the middle of the hot bath, and poured over him warm water, after which he prepared a draught and gave it to him to drink. And he kept him there till such time as the humours in his joints were matured.\n\nThen he himself went out and put on his clothes, and, taking a knife in his hand, came in, and stood for a while reviling the King, saying: \"Thou didst order me to be bound and cast into the boat, and didst conspire against my life. If I do not destroy thee as a punishment for this, I am not Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u00e1!\"\nThe Amir was furious, sprang from his place, and, partly from anger, partly from fear of the knife and dread of death, rose to his feet. When Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u0101 saw the Amir on his feet, he turned round and went out from the bath, and he and his servant mounted, the one the horse, the other the mule, and turned their faces towards the Oxus. At the time of the second prayer they crossed the river, and halted nowhere till they reached Merv. When Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u0101 reached Merv, he alighted, and wrote a letter to the Amir, saying: \"May the life of the King be prolonged in health of body and effective command! According to agreement this servant treated his master, doing all that was possible. There was, however, an extreme weakness in the natural caloric, and the treatment of the disease by ordinary means would have been a protracted affair. I therefore abandoned it, and carried you to the hot bath for psychical treatment, and administered a draught, and left you so long as to bring about a maturity of the humours. Then I angered the King, so that an increase in the natural caloric was produced, and it gained strength until those humours, already softened, were dissolved. But henceforth it is not expedient that a meeting should take place between myself and the King.\"\n\nNow after the Amir had risen to his feet and Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u0101 had gone out, the Amir sat down and at once fainted. When he came to himself he went forth from the bath and called to his servants, saying, \"Where has the physician gone?\" They answered, \"He came out from the bath, and mounted the horse, while his attendant mounted the mule, and went off.\"\n\nThen the Amir knew what object he had had in view. So he came forth on his own feet from the hot bath; and tidings of this ran through the city, and his servants and retainers and people rejoiced greatly, and gave alms, and offered sacrifices, and held high festival. But they could not find the physician, seek him as they might. And on the seventh day Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u0101's servant\narrived, riding the horse and leading the mule, and presented the letter. The Amir read it, and was astonished, and excused him, and sent him a horse, and a robe of honour, and equipment, and a cloak, and arms, and a turban, and a male slave, and a handmaiden; and further commanded that there should be assigned to him in Ray from the estates of al-Ma'm\u00fan\u00b9 a yearly allowance of two\u00b2 thousand din\u00e1rs and two hundred ass-loads of corn. These marks of honour he forwarded to him by the hand of a trusty messenger, together with his apologies. So the Amir completely regained his health, and Mu\u1e25ammad b. Zakariyy\u00e1 attained his object.\n\nAnecdote xxxvi.\n\nMa'm\u00fan Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1h\u00b3 had an accomplished Minister named Abu'l-\u1e24asan \u1e24amad b. Mu\u1e25ammad. He was a man of learning and a friend of scholars, and consequently many philosophers and men of erudition, such as Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed b. S\u00edn\u00e1, Ab\u00fa Sahl Mas\u012b\u1e25i, Abu'l-\u1e24asan Khamm\u00e1r, Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r 'Arr\u00e1q, and Ab\u00fa Ray\u1e25\u00e1n [al-Bir\u00fani],\u2074 gathered about his court.\n\nNow Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r 'Arr\u00e1q was the nephew of Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1h, and in all branches of the exact sciences he was second only to Ptolemy the Philosopher; while Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed [b S\u00edn\u00e1] and Ab\u00fa Sahl Mas\u012b\u1e25i were the successors of Aristotle\u2075 in\n\n\u00b9 The text has \u0645\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0625\u0632\u0627\u0644\u0629\u060c but perhaps the last word is to be taken as meaning \"settled,\" \"tranquil.\"\n\u00b2 So in L., and so corrected in A. from \"twelve thousand.\"\n\u00b3 See p. viii of the Preface to Sachau's translation of al-Bir\u00fani's Chronology of the Ancient Nations, and the same scholar's article Zur Geschichte und Chronologie von Chwarzem in the Sitzungsberichte d. Wiener Akademie for 1863.\n\u2074 The first, second, and last of these learned men have been already mentioned. The third is probably Abu'l-Khayr al-\u1e24asan . . . Ibnu'l-Khamm\u00e1r (W\u00fcstenfeld's Geschichte d. Arab. \u00c4ltere, No. 115, pp. 58, 59), who died A.H. 381 (A.D. 991).\n\u2075 The texts have \"of Arist\u00f3 and Arist\u00e1talis,\" as though they were two different persons, instead of two forms of the same name.\nthe science of Philosophy, which includes all sciences; and Abu'l-Hasan Khamm\u00e1r was the third after Hippocrates and Galen in the science of Medicine. And all these were, in this their service, independent of worldly cares, and maintained with one another familiar intercourse and pleasant correspondence.\n\nBut Fortune, as is its custom, disapproved of this; though the King would not willingly have destroyed this happiness of theirs, or brought these pleasant days to an end. So a notable arrived from Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad Yam\u00ednu'd-Dawla with a letter, whereof the purport was as follows: \"I have heard that there are in attendance on Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1h several men of learning, each unrivalled in his science, such as So-and-so and So-and-so. You must send them to my court, so that they may attain the honour of attendance thereat. We rely on being enabled to profit by their knowledge and skill, and request this favour on the part of Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1h.\"\n\nNow the bearer of this message was Khw\u00e1ja Husayn 'Al\u00ed M\u00edk\u00e1'il, who was one of the most accomplished men of his age, and the wonder of his time amongst his contemporaries, while the prosperity of Sult\u00e1n Yam\u00ednu'd-Dawla continued ever on the increase in the zenith of dominion and empire, and the kings of the time used to treat him with every respect and do him homage, and night and day lay down in fear of him. So Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1h entertained Husayn 'Al\u00ed M\u00edk\u00e1'il in the best of lodgings, and ordered him to be supplied with all materials suitable for a prolonged stay; but, before according him an audience, he summoned the philosophers and laid before them the King's letter, saying: \"The King is strong, and has a large army recruited from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n and India; and he covets 'Ir\u00e1q. I cannot refuse to obey his order, or be disobedient to his mandate. What say ye on this matter?\"\n\nThey answered, \"We cannot abandon thy service, nor will we in any wise go to him.\" But Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r and Abu'l-Hasan and Ab\u00fa Rayh\u00e1n were eager to go, having heard accounts of the King's munificent gifts and presents. Then\nsaid Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1h, \"I will summon you before me, and do you take your own way.\" Then he equipped Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed [b. S\u00edn\u00e1] and Ab\u00fa Sahl, and arranged a plan for them, and sent with them a guide, and they set off through the desert towards M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n.\n\nNext day Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1h accorded Husayn \u2018Al\u00ed M\u00edk\u00e1\u2019il an audience, and heaped on him all sorts of compliments. \"I have read the letter,\" said he, \"and have acquainted myself with its contents and with the King's command. Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed and Ab\u00fa Sahl are gone, but I will provide equipment for Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r and Ab\u00fa Ray\u1e25\u00e1n and Abu\u2019l-\u1e24asan,\" so that they may enjoy the honour of entering that August Presence.\" So in a little while he provided their outfit, and despatched them in the company of Khw\u00e1ja \u1e24usayn M\u00edk\u00e1\u2019il to Balkh. So they came into the presence of Sult\u00e1n Yam\u00ednu\u2019d-Dawla, and joined the King's Court.\n\nNow it was Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed [b. S\u00edn\u00e1] whom the King chiefly desired. He commanded Ab\u00fa Na\u1e63r the painter to draw his portrait on paper, and he ordered the other artists to make forty copies of the portrait, and these he despatched in all directions, placing them in the hands of persons of note, to whom he said, \"There is a man after this likeness, whom they call Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed b. S\u00edn\u00e1. Seek him out and send him to me.\"\n\nNow when Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed and Ab\u00fa Sahl departed from Khw\u00e1razmsh\u00e1h, ere morning came they had travelled fifteen parasangs. When it was morning they alighted at a place where there were wells, and Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed took up an astrological table to see under what ascendant they had started on their journey. \"We shall lose our way,\" said he, \"and experience hardships.\" Said Ab\u00fa Sahl: \"We acquiesce in God's decree. Indeed, I know that I shall not come safely through this journey, for in these two days\n\n1 L.'s reading is: \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0645\u060c A. adds the words \u062f\u0648 \u062a\u06a9 after \u0634\u0645\u0627.\n2 Here and elsewhere A. has \u1e24usayn for \u1e24asan.\n3 So A.

Henceforth our intercourse of souls is at an end.\"\\(^2\\)\n\nThen a wind arose and clouds gathered. Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed relates as follows. On the fourth day a dust-storm arose, and the world was darkened. They lost their way, for the wind had obliterated the tracks. When the wind lulled, their guide was a thousand times more astray than before; no water was obtainable; and, by reason of the heat of the desert of Khw\u00e1razm, Ab\u00fa Sahl Mas\u00edh\u00ed passed away to the World of Eternity. The guide turned back, while Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed, with a thousand hardships and difficulties, reached Abiward, whence he went to T\u00fas, and finally happened on N\u00edsh\u00e1p\u00far.\n\nThere he found a number of persons who were seeking for Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed. He alighted in a quiet spot, where he abode several days, and thence he turned his face towards Gurg\u00e1n. Q\u00e1b\u00fas,\\(^3\\) who was king of that province, was a great and accomplished man, and a friend to men of learning. Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed knew that there no harm would befall him. When he reached Gurg\u00e1n, he alighted at a caravanseray. One day a person fell sick in his neighbourhood. Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed treated him, and he got better. It is related that Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed continued to live in Gurg\u00e1n,\\(^4\\) and that his income became considerable and went on increasing day by day. Some time elapsed thus, until one of the relatives of Q\u00e1b\u00fas fell sick. The physicians set themselves to treat him, striving and exerting themselves to the utmost, but the disease was not cured. Now Q\u00e1b\u00fas was greatly attached\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The text has \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064f \u062f\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0629\u064d \u0637\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0639\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062a\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064e \u0631\u064e\u062c\u064f\u0648\u0639\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e\u062f\u0652.\n\n\\(^2\\) The term tasy\u00edr is explained at p. 230 of Van Vloten's ed. of the Maf\u00e1ithu'l-'ul\u00fam.\n\n\\(^3\\) This last sentence is in A. only.\n\n\\(^4\\) Q\u00e1b\u00fas b.

So one of the servants of Q\u00e1b\u00fas did obeisance before him and said: \"Into such-and-such a caravanseray hath entered a young man who is a physician, and whose efforts are singularly blessed, so that several persons have been cured at his hands.\" So Q\u00e1b\u00fas bade them seek him out and bring him to the patient.\n\nSo they sought out Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed and brought him to the sick man. He saw a youth of comely countenance, whereon the hair had scarcely begun to show itself, and of symmetrical proportions. He sat down, felt his pulse, asked to see his urine, inspected it, and said, \"I want a man who knows all the districts and the quarters of this province.\" So they brought one; and Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed placed his hand on the patient's pulse, and bade the other mention the names of the different quarters and districts of Gurg\u00e1n. So the man began, and continued until he reached the name of a quarter at the mention of which, as he uttered it, the patient's pulse gave a strange flutter. Then Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed said, \"Now I must have someone who knows all the streets in this quarter.\" They brought such an one. \"Repeat,\" said Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed, \"the names of all the houses in this district.\" So he repeated them till he reached the name of a house at the mention of which the patient's pulse gave the same flutter. \"Now,\" said Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed, \"I want someone who knows all the households.\" They brought such an one, and he began to repeat them until he reached a name at the mention of which that same strange flutter was apparent.\n\nThen said Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed, \"It is finished.\" Thereupon he turned to the confidential advisers of Q\u00e1b\u00fas, and said: \"This lad is in love with such-and-such a girl, in such-and-such a house, in such-and-such a street, in such-and-such a quarter: the girl's face is the patient's cure.\" The patient, who was listening, heard what was said, and in shame hid his face beneath the clothes. When they made enquiries, it was even as Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed had said.\u00b9 Then they\n\n\u00b9 Compare the precisely similar narrative in the first story of the first book of the Mathnawi of Jal\u00e1lu'd-D\u00edn R\u00fam\u00ed, and also a passage in the section of the Dhakhira-i-Khw\u0101razmsh\u0101h\u012b (Book vi, Gutt\u00e1r i, Juz' 2, ch. 3), of which this\nreported this matter to Q\u00e1b\u00fas, who was amazed thereat and said, \"Bring him before me.\" So Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed b. S\u00edn\u00e1 was brought before Q\u00e1b\u00fas.\n\nNow Q\u00e1b\u00fas had a copy of Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed\u2019s portrait, which Yam\u00ednu\u2019d-Dawla had sent to him. \"Why, here is Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed!\" exclaimed he. \"Yes, O most puissant Prince,\" replied the other. Then Q\u00e1b\u00fas came down from his throne, advanced several paces to meet Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed, embraced him, conversed genially with him, sat down beside him, and said, \"O greatest and most accomplished philosopher of the world, explain to me the rationale of this treatment!\"\n\n\"O Sire,\" answered Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed, \"when I inspected his pulse and urine, I became convinced that his complaint was love, and that he had fallen thus sick through keeping his secret. Had I enquired of him, he would not have told me; so I placed my hand on his pulse while they repeated in succession the names of the different quarters, and when it came to the name of the quarter of his beloved, love moved him, and his heart was stirred, so that I knew she was a dweller in that quarter. Then I enquired the streets, and when I reached the street in question that same movement occurred, and I knew that she dwelt in that street. Then I enquired the names of the households in that street, and the same phenomenon occurred when the house of his beloved was named, so that I knew the house also. Then they made mention of the names of its inhabitants, and when he heard the name of his beloved, he was greatly affected, so that I knew the name of his sweetheart also. Then I told him my conclusion, and he could not deny it, but was compelled to confess the truth.\"\n\nis a translation:\u2014\"Now the lover\u2019s pulse is variable and irregular, especially when he sees the object of his affections, or hears her name, or gets tidings of her. In this way one can discover, in the case of one who conceals his love and the name of his beloved, who is the object of his passion, and that in the following way. The physician should place his finger on the patient\u2019s pulse, and unexpectedly order the names of those persons amongst whom it may be surmised that his sweetheart is to be found to be repeated, whereupon it will appear from the patient\u2019s behaviour who his beloved is, and what her name is. Avicenna (upon whom be God\u2019s Mercy) says: \u2018I have tried this plan, and have succeeded by it in finding out who the beloved object was.\u2019\"\nQ\u00e1b\u00fas was greatly astonished, and indeed there was good reason for astonishment. \"O most eminent and most excellent philosopher of the world,\" said he, \"both the lover and the beloved are the children of my sisters, and are cousins to one another. Choose, then, an auspicious moment that I may unite them in marriage.\" So the Master [Avicenna] chose a fortunate hour, and in it they were united, and that prince was cured of the ailment which had brought him to death's door. And thereafter Q\u00e1b\u00fas maintained Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed in the best manner possible, and thence he went to Ray, and finally became minister to 'Al\u00e1'u'd-Dawla, as is well known in history.\n\nAneadote xxxvi.\n\nThe author of the K\u00e1milu's-San\u00e1'at\u00b9 was physician to 'Adudu'd-Dawla\u00b2 in P\u00e1rs, in the city of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. Now in that city there was a porter who used to carry loads of four hundred and five hundred maunds on his back. And every five or six months he would be attacked by headache, and become restless, remaining so for ten\u00b3 days and nights. One time he was attacked by headache, and when seven or eight days had elapsed, he several times determined to destroy himself. At length one day this physician passed by the door of his house. The porter's brother ran to meet him, did reverence to him, and, conjuring him by God Most High, told him his brother's condition. \"Bring him to me,\" said the physician. So they called him before the physician, who saw that he was a big man, of bulky frame, wearing on his feet a pair of shoes each of which weighed a maund and a half. Then the physician asked for and examined his urine; after which, \"Bring him with me into the open country,\" said\n\n\u00b9 See Brockelmann's Gesch. d. Arab. Litt., p. 237, No. 19. His name was 'Ali b. al-'Abb\u00e1s al-Maj\u00fasi, and he died A.H. 384 (A.D. 994).\n\u00b2 The second prince of the House of Buwayh, reigned A.H. 338-372 (A.D. 949-982).\n\u00b3 So A., but L. has \"two.\"\nhe. They did so. On their arrival there, he bade his servant take the turban from his head, and cast it round his neck. Then he ordered another servant to take the shoes off the porter's feet and kick him on the back of the neck. The porter's sons wept, but the physician was a man of consideration, so that they could say nothing. Then the physician ordered his servant to throw the turban round his neck, to mount his horse, and to make the porter run round the plain. The servant did as he was bid. Blood began to flow from the porter's nostrils. \"Now,\" said the physician, \"let him alone, that the blood may flow from him, for he stinketh worse than a corpse.\" The man fell asleep amidst the blood which flowed from his nose, and three hundred dirhams' weight of blood escaped from his nostrils. They bore him thence, and he slept for a day and a night, and his headache passed away and never again returned.\n\nThen 'A\u1e0dudu'd-Dawla questioned the physician as to the rationale of this treatment. \"O King,\" he replied, \"for some while the blood had coagulated\\(^1\\) in his head, and it was impossible to relieve this congestion by means of belladonna,\\(^2\\) so I devised another treatment, which proved successful.\"\n\n**Anecdote xxxvii.**\n\nMelancholia is a disease which physicians often fail to treat successfully, for, though all melancholic diseases are chronic, melancholia is a pathological condition which is [especially] slow to pass.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps \"coagulated\" is too strong a word for \u0623\u0641\u0633\u062f\u060c and we should rather translate \"for some while he had suffered from congestion of the head\" or \"cerebral congestion.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) \u0628\u0627\u0631\u062c [\u0628\u0627\u0631\u062c] \u0628\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u062c\u060c \u0641\u0642\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b.

Yahya, in his work entitled the \"Hippocratic Therapeutics\" (Mu'talaja-i-Bugrati), a book the like of which hath been composed by no one on the Art of Medicine, hath reckoned up the leaders of thought, sages, physicians, scholars, and philosophers who have been afflicted by this disease, for there were many of them; and he continues thus:\n\n\"My master Abu Ja'far b. Muhammad Abu Sa'id al-Nashawi, commonly known as Sarakh, related to me,\" says he, \"on the authority of the Imam Shaykh Muhammad b. al-'Aqil al-Qazwini, on the authority of the Amir Fakhrud-Dawla Kalinjar the Buwayhid, that one of the princes of the House of Buwayh was attacked by melancholy, and was in such wise affected by the disease that he imagined himself to have been transformed into a cow. Every day he would low like a cow, causing annoyance to everyone, and saying, 'Kill me, so that a good stew may be prepared from my flesh'; until matters reached such a pass that he would eat nothing, and the physicians were unable to do him any good.\n\n\"Now at this juncture Abu 'Ali (Avicenna) was prime minister, and the king 'Ala'u'd-Dawla Muhammad b. Washmgir had the fullest confidence in him, and had entrusted into his hands all the affairs of the kingdom, and placed under his judgment and discretion all matters. And, indeed, since Alexander the Great, whose minister was Aristotle, no king had such a minister as Abu 'Ali. And during the time that he was minister, he used to rise up every morning before dawn and write a couple of pages of the Shifa. Then, when the true dawn appeared, he\n\n---\n\n1 See Brockelmann's Gesh. d. Arab. Litt., p. 237, where his name is given as Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali b. Muhammad at-Tabari. He was court physician to the Buwayhid prince Ruknud-Dawla about A.H. 360 (A.D. 970). MSS. of the work cited exist at Oxford, Munich, and in the India Office.\n\n2 A. has Sa'di.\n\n3 So all texts.\n\n4 One of Avicenna's most celebrated works. See the British Museum Arabic Catalogue, p. 74a, and the Supplement to the same, No. 711, pp. 484, 485.\nused to give audience to his disciples, such as Kiy\u00e1 Ra\u2019\u00eds Bahmany\u00e1r, Ab\u00fa Mans\u00far Z\u00edla,1 \u2018Abdu\u2019l-W\u00e1hid Jurj\u00e1n\u00ed, Sulayman of Damascus, and me, Ab\u00fa K\u00e1l\u00ednj\u00e1r. We used to continue our studies till the morning grew bright, and then perform our prayers behind him; and as soon as he came forth he was met at the gate of his house by a thousand mounted men, comprising the dignitaries and notables, as well as such as had boons to crave, or were in difficulties. Then the minister would mount, and this company would attend him to the Government Offices. By the time he arrived there, the number of horsemen had reached two thousand. And there he would remain until the morning prayer, and when he retired for refreshment all that company ate with him. Then he took his midday siesta, and when he rose up from this he would perform his prayer, wait on the King, and remain talking and conversing with him until the next prayer; and in all matters of importance there was no third person between him and the King.\n\n\u201cOur object in narrating these details is to show that the minister had no leisure time. Now when the physicians proved unable to cure this young man, the King\u2019s intercession was sought, so that he might bid his minister take the case in hand. So \u2018Al\u00e1\u2019u\u2019d-Dawla spoke to him to this effect, and he consented. Then said he, \u2018Good tidings to the patient, for the butcher has come to kill him!\u2019 When the patient heard this, he rejoiced. Then the minister mounted his horse, and came with his retinue to the gate of the patient\u2019s house. Taking a knife in his hand, he entered with two attendants, saying, \u2018Where is this cow, that I may kill it?\u2019 The patient made a noise like a cow, meaning, \u2018He is here.\u2019 The minister bade them bind him hand and foot in the middle of the house. The patient ran forward into the middle of the house and lay down on his right side, and they bound his hands and feet firmly, and \u2018Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed then came forward, rubbing\n\n1 \u0623\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0652\u0632\u0650.\nthe knives together, sat down, and placed his hand on his side, as is the custom of butchers. 'He is very lean,' said he, 'and not fit to be killed: he must eat fodder until he gets fat.' Then he rose up and came out, having hidden them loose his hands and feet, and place food before him, saying, 'Eat, so that thou mayst grow fat.' They did so, and he ate, and recovered his appetite, after which they administered to him drugs and draughts. 'This cow,' said Ab\u00fa \u2018Al\u00ed, 'must be well fattened'; so the patient ate in the hope that he might grow fat and they might kill him; while the physicians applied themselves vigorously to treating him as the minister had indicated, and in a month's time he completely recovered.'\n\nAll wise men will perceive that one cannot heal by such methods of treatment save by virtue of extreme excellence, perfect science, and unerring acumen.\n\nAnecdote xxxviii.\n\nIn the reign of Maliksh\u00e1h, and during part of the reign of Sult\u00e1n Sanjar, there was at Her\u00e1t a philosopher named Ad\u00edb Isma\u2018il, a very great and perfect man, who, however, derived his income from his receipts as a physician. By him many rare cures of this class were wrought.\n\nOne day he was passing through the sheep-slayers' market. A butcher was skinning a sheep, and was eating the warm fat which he took from its belly. Khw\u00e1ja Isma\u2018il said to a grocer opposite him, \"If at any time this fellow should die, inform me of it before they lay him in his grave.\" \"Willingly,\" replied the grocer. When five or six months had elapsed, one morning it was rumoured abroad that such-and-such a butcher had died suddenly without any premonitory illness. The grocer also went to offer his condolences. He found a number of people tearing their garments, while others were consumed with grief, for\n\n1 So in L. A. has: \"And every now and then he would put his hand into the sheep's belly, pull out some of the warm fat, and swallow it.\"\nthe dead man was young, and had little children. Then he remembered the words of Khw\u00e1ja Isma\u2018il, and hastened to bear the intelligence to him. Said the Khw\u00e1ja, \u201cHe has been a long time in dying.\u201d Then he arose, took his staff, went to the dead man\u2019s house, raised the sheet from the face of the corpse, and began to apply the remedies for apoplexy.\\(^1\\) On the third day the dead man arose, and, though he remained paralytic, he lived for many years, and men were astonished, for that great man had seen from the first that he would be stricken by apoplexy.\n\n**Anecdote xxxix.**\n\nThe Shaykhul-Isl\u00e1m \u2018Abdu\u2019ll\u00e1h An\u1e63\u00e1r\u00ed (may God sanctify his spirit!) conceived a fanatical hatred of the above-mentioned man of science, and several times attempted to do him an injury, and burned his books. Now this fanatical dislike arose from religious motives, for the people of Her\u00e1t believed that he could restore the dead to life, and this belief was injurious to his own pretensions.\\(^2\\)\n\nNow the Shaykh fell ill, and in the course of his illness the death-rattle became apparent. However much the physicians treated him, it availed nothing. They were in despair, and so sent a sample of his urine to the Khw\u00e1ja under the name of another, and requested him to prescribe. When he had inspected it, he said: \u201cThis is the urine of so-and-so, in whom the death-rattle has become apparent, and whom they are unable to treat. Bid them pound together a *\u0161ir* of pistachio-skins and a *\u0161ir*\\(^3\\) of the sugar called *\u02bfaskar\u00ed* and give it to him, so that he may recover; and give him this message: \u2018You should study science, and not burn men\u2019s books.\u2019\u201d\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0633\u0643\u062a\u0647.\n\n\\(^2\\) So B. and L.

They informed Galen, who prescribed an unguent to be applied to his shoulders. As soon as they did this he was cured. Then they questioned Galen, saying, \"What was [the rationale of] this treatment which thou didst adopt?\" He replied: \"This, that the source of a pain which attacks the fingertips is the shoulder. I treated the root so that the branch might be cured.\"\n\nAnecdote xli.\n\nIn the year A.H. 547 (= A.D. 1152\u20133), when a battle took place at Dar\u00e1ward between the King of the World Sanjar b.

Lately she has fallen a victim to a malady such that during the days of her monthly courses ten or fifteen sirs\\(^1\\) of sanguineous matter come from her, and she is greatly weakened.

XXI.\u2014Baghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate. A Topographical Summary, with a Notice of the Contemporary Arabic and Persian Authorities. By G. Le Strange.\n\nFour years ago I submitted to the readers of this Journal \"A Description of Mesopotamia and Baghdad, written about the year 900 A.D. by Ibn Serapion,\" in the course of which paper an attempt was made to sketch, in rough outline, the Plan of the mediaeval City of the Caliphs. This was derived from the accounts of the canals given by Ibn Serapion; and recognizing the imperfection of this Sketch Plan, I expressed my intention of returning again to the subject of Baghdad topography, and of completing, in a future article, the very cursory notes which were all that I had then been able to give with the translation of Ibn Serapion.\n\nThat there is no lack of material for working out the history of Baghdad will be shown presently, and underestimating my task, I had at first hoped that one or two papers in this Journal, as the result of a year's work, would have exhausted the subject. This, however, has proved to be a delusion. The time was doubled and again doubled, for the materials demanded a far more detailed examination than could be accomplished in a few months, nor could the results be condensed into a score or two of pages. The outcome of four years' work forms a volume, which is now ready for the press, and which it is hoped will be published in the course of the next few months. In the meantime a summary of the results, in part correcting the Sketch Plan appended to my former paper, may now be given. This summary\n\n1 See J.R.A.S. for 1895, January, April, and October.\n2 See in J.R.A.S. for 1895, the Plan facing p. 275, where the whole of Western Baghdad is put too low down in regard to the Eastern Quarter; further the lower course of the 'Isa Canal should be as it is marked in the two following Plans.\nwill form the concluding chapters of my book, to which the reader is referred for all detail, and for full references to all the authorities. Of these last also some account will now be given, together with a short critical notice of their writings, whether historical or geographical, to which we owe the information that has made it possible, in part, to reconstruct the Plan of the City of the Caliphs.\n\nThe topography of mediaeval Baghdad has not, hitherto, met with the attention that the subject deserves; for it must be admitted that any detailed history of the Caliphs is incomprehensible if the plan of their capital cannot be laid before the reader. As far as I know, the only attempt that has yet been made to realize the appearance of the metropolitan city of the Eastern Caliphate, is due to the late A. von Kremer, who, in one chapter of his excellent History of Civilization in the East, has translated the description given by Ya'k\u016bb\u012b of the original burg or Round City built by Mansur.\\(^1\\) But this citadel was to later Baghdad much what at the present day the City, in modern London, has become in relation to the metropolis which encompasses it for miles on every side; and of greater Baghdad, Kremer says nothing. Further he does not attempt to give any plan even of the Round City, the position of which, in relation to modern Baghdad, he has not indicated. What Kremer left fragmentary I hope now to have completed.\n\nOur systematic knowledge of the topography, as a whole, of mediaeval Baghdad, is chiefly derived from two nearly contemporary sources, namely, Ya'k\u016bb\u012b, who wrote near the end of the third century of the Hijrah, and Ibn Serapion, whose work dates from the beginning of the fourth: in other words, respectively a short time before and after the year 900 A.D. The first of these authorities, Ya'k\u016bb\u012b, describes the various quarters and buildings of the city as the traveller would pass them by when taking his way, in turn, along each of the great highroads which radiated to various points of\n\n\\(^1\\) Kulturgeschichte des Orients unter den Chalifen, vol. ii, pp. 47 to 94 (Wien, 1873).\nthe compass from the four Gates of the Round City; Ibn Serapion, on the other hand, chiefly occupies himself with tracing out the network of Canals whose ramifications traversed those later suburbs of the Round City, which in time came to form the two great quarters of West and East Baghdad. And finally it is by marking the intersection of the various watercourses with the chief highroads that, after thus combining the two descriptions, it has been found possible to lay out a rough sort of triangulation for the plan of mediaeval Baghdad, of which otherwise the few vestiges that still remain would hardly have afforded sufficient data for any reliable reconstruction of its topography.\n\nFrom its foundation by the Caliph Mans\u016br to its capture by Hul\u0101g\u016b the Mongol, the history of the city is that of the Abbasid Caliphate, and the events accompanying its rise and fall will, perhaps, be better understood if the five centuries that elapsed during this long period be divided into five rather unequal parts, representing, as it were, so many Acts in the great drama of the history of Islam.\n\nThese five divisions are:\u2014(1) the period of the great Caliphs, from the foundation of the Dynasty in 132 (750 A.D.) to the death of Mam\u016bn in 218 (833 A.D.); (2) the tyranny of the Turkish Body Guard, ending in 334 (946 A.D.), when Mu'izz-ad-Dawlah, the Buyid Prince, became master in Baghdad; (3) the period of the Buyid supremacy; (4) followed by the Salj\u016bk supremacy, beginning with Tughril Beg, who entered Baghdad in 447 (1055 A.D.), and ending with the death of Sultan Sanjar, the last of the great Salj\u016bks, in 552 (1157 A.D.); (5) lastly the period of decline and fall, which ended with the Mongol conquest, the sack of Baghdad in 656 (1258 A.D.), and the death of the last Abbasid Caliph, Musta'sim.\n\nIn so far as the history of the city of Baghdad itself is concerned, the first period of course only starts with the date of the foundation of the Round City by the Caliph Mans\u016br, namely about the year 145 (762 A.D.), closing with the death of Mam\u016bn, as already said, or in other words, the period begins with the reign of the grandfather of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd.\nand ends with the life of the second of his sons who attained the Caliphate. These seventy and odd years form the most brilliant epoch of Moslem history; the Caliphs were then great warriors and sovereigns, and the fact is significant that, with the sole exception of Am\u012bn, no Caliph during this period died in Baghdad: for their tombs lie scattered over the length and breadth of the Empire\u2014from the Pilgrim Road by Mecca, to T\u016bs in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, or the Gates of Tarsus in the north-west\u2014the burial-place of the Caliph being where he had died, on the road, so to speak, journeying for the affairs of Islam.\n\nFor this first period we have unfortunately no written contemporary authorities, but for the topography of Baghdad an event of much importance is the first siege of the capital in the year 198 (814 A.D.), when Am\u012bn, son of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, defended himself during eighteen months against the generals of his brother Mam\u016bn. The detailed narrative of this siege, taken down from the accounts of eye-witnesses and reduced to system, has been transmitted to us in the pages of the great chronicle of Tabari. In this, the incidental mention of places attacked or defended during the siege operations enables us to fix the position of many points left vague in the two great systematic descriptions of Baghdad written by Ya'k\u016bb\u012b and Ibn Serapion, which belong to the following century, from whose writings chiefly (as already said) the plan has been reconstructed.\n\nREFERENCES TO PLAN OF BAGHDAD.\n\nNo. 1.\n\n1.

Palace of Amin in the Kalw\u0101dh\u0101 Rakk\u0101h.\n\nIt will be remembered that Baghdad, as founded by Man\u1e63\u016br, was a circular city, or burg, four miles in circumference, having four equidistant gates with a triple wall, which, in concentric circles, enclosed the great Palace and Mosque of the Caliph standing in the middle of the\nwide central area. Before the death of Mans\u016br, in 158 (775 A.D.), however, the city had already spread far beyond these modest limits. Suburbs had grown up along the high roads starting from each of the four gates, and these suburbs, together with East Baghdad or Rus\u0101fah, founded at almost the same time as the Round City, but on the other bank of the Tigris, covered ground measuring five miles across in the length and in the breadth.\n\nThus, beginning at the Ba\u1e63rah, or south-eastern, Gate of the Round City, one highroad went down-stream along the river bank, having the Shark\u012byah Quarter on the one hand near the Tigris, and the great Karkh Quarter on the other side, inland; and this last with its markets is described as stretching for nearly two leagues southward of Baghdad. The Karkh Quarter on the side furthest from the river was bordered by the highroad running south, which was the great Pilgrim Way leading to Mecca. This was known as the K\u016bfah Road (from the city of that name on the Euphrates), and this highway started from the bifurcation outside the K\u016bfah Gate at the south-western part of the Round City. Beyond the square at this Gate two highroads began, namely, the K\u016bfah Road south, bordering Karkh, as just described, and the Muhawwal Road west, passing through the town of Muhawwal, on the \u1e2ais\u0101 Canal, to the city of Anb\u0101r on the Euphrates. From the Syrian Gate, in the north-western part of the Round City, a thoroughfare also went westward, called the Anb\u0101r Road, which, passing first through the Harbiyah Suburb to the Anb\u0101r Gate and there crossing the Bridge over the Trench of T\u0101hir, finally struck into the Muhawwal Road at a point beyond Muhawwal Town, having thus far kept along the northern bank of the \u1e2ais\u0101 Canal.\n\nBeyond the suburb at the K\u016bfah Gate, and lying westward of the Round City, were various minor suburbs round the Muhawwal Gate, bordering on the highroad to the town of that name; while north of the Syrian Gate stretched the great Harb Quarter, or the \u1e24arbiyah, occupying all the ground within the city limits up-stream above the\nRound City; and beyond the Trench of \u1e6c\u0101hir lay the cemeteries afterwards known as the K\u0101zimayn Shrines. Outside the north-eastern or Khur\u0101s\u0101n Gate of the Round City, the Caliph Mans\u016br had built his great Palace, called the Khuld, lying to the right or south of the road leading to the Main Bridge of Boats across the Tigris; and on the further side of the river stood the Palace and suburb of Ru\u1e63\u0101fah. This lay to the northward of the Bridge end, and beyond it to the eastward came the Shamm\u0101siyah Quarter, stretching from the river bank (opposite the \u1e24arbiyah Quarter) to the Khur\u0101s\u0101n Gate of the Eastern City; while to the south of the Main Bridge lay the Mukharrim Quarter.\n\nDuring the reign of Mahdi, son and successor of Mans\u016br, Ru\u1e63\u0101fah grew to rival West Baghdad in the extent and magnificence of its various palaces and market streets. Round the Palace and Mosque which Mahdi had built, his attendants and their followers received grants of lands, and just as the Round City had come to be encompassed by the suburbs in which stood the Fiefs of the nobles belonging more especially to the Court of Mans\u016br, so Ru\u1e63\u0101fah, during the eleven years reign of Mahdi, became the centre of a town of palaces built by the next generation of courtiers. In the year 170 (786 A.D.), when the reign of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd began, the three Eastern Quarters of Ru\u1e63\u0101fah, Shamm\u0101siyah, and Mukharrim probably formed almost as great a city on the east side of the Tigris as was the City of Mans\u016br with its suburbs on the west bank. The Caliph still lived in the Khuld Palace and most of the Diw\u0101ns (or Government Offices) remained in the Round City, but his Waz\u012br Ja\u02bffar, the Barmecide, had recently built himself a palace on the eastern Tigris bank below the Mukharrim Quarter (which palace subsequently formed the nucleus of the later Palaces of the Caliphs), and much of the business of state was, during the reign of H\u0101r\u016bn, transacted in Eastern Baghdad under the supervision of Ja\u02bffar.\n\nThe fall of the Barmecides cast its gloom over the later\nyears of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rashid, and shortly after the death of the great Caliph the rivalry which had from their birth existed between his two sons\u2014Amin, whose mother was the Abbasid Princess Zubaydah, and Mam\u016bn the son of a Persian bondwoman\u2014broke out into civil war. The Caliphate belonged by right to Amin, but H\u0101r\u016bn had named Mam\u016bn next in the succession, and meanwhile had appointed him Governor for life of Khur\u0101s\u0101n and the whole eastern half of the Empire. The Caliph Amin, after succeeding peaceably to the throne, had at first remained inactive at Baghdad, but before long he precipitated the crisis by naming his own son, M\u016bsa, heir apparent, thus attempting to deprive Mam\u016bn of the succession. Thereupon Mam\u016bn took up arms, nominally in defence of his future rights, and causing his brother Amin to be solemnly deposed in all the Mosques of Persia, Syria, and Arabia (which provinces had declared for him), the armies of Mam\u016bn advanced through Persia on lower Mesopotamia, preparatory to the siege of Baghdad.\n\nAmin meanwhile had shut himself up in the capital, and Mam\u016bn, who himself remained safely established in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, had given the command of the invading force to two of his generals, namely Harthamah, who marched to attack Baghdad from the east, and T\u0101hir (subsequently founder of the T\u0101hirid Dynasty of Khur\u0101s\u0101n), who, after crossing the Tigris at Mad\u0101'in (Ctesiphon) into lower Mesopotamia, was ordered to come up the great K\u016bfah Road and thus invest the city from the western side. The accounts in Tabar\u012b name the exact positions of the troops. Harthamah, on the eastern side, after defeating the army which Amin had sent to oppose him at Nahraw\u0101n, established his headquarters on the hither side of the canal called the Nahr B\u012bn, probably near the spot where the Palace of the Pleiades was afterwards built, and then fortified his camp with a wall and a ditch. His right wing was before the Sham\u0101l\u0101siyah Gate on the river bank above the city, while his left wing occupied a pleasure palace.\n\n1 Tabari, iii. 837 to 925. For the editions of works quoted in this and the following notes see my former paper J.R.A.S., 1895, p. 7.\nbuilt by Am\u012bn in the plain called the Rakkah of the Kalw\u0101dh\u0101 District below the city. At this date Eastern Baghdad had no city walls, but the townspeople proceeded to build barricades to block the roads at their exit from the city, and from gate to gate the line of houses and garden walls served as the outer line of defence.\n\nOn the western side T\u0101hir settled his headquarters in the garden outside the Anb\u0101r Gate, where the Anb\u0101r Bridge crossed the Trench that went by his name, and he forthwith began his attack on the outlying suburbs of this side. The houses in the Harbiyah Quarter were soon destroyed by his catapults (Manjan\u012bk), and the ruin effected is described as extending from the Tigris bank at the Baghiyin Quarter round past the Syrian Gate to the K\u016bsh Gate, and thence down to the line of the \u1e62ar\u0101t Canal. Fire completed the destruction begun by the catapults, the great Mills at the junction of the two \u1e62ar\u0101t Canals were in part destroyed, and all the suburbs from the Quarter of \u1e24umayd down to the Karkh\u0101ya Canal are stated to have been laid in ruins. The siege dragged on from month to month, and the inhabitants of the city began to suffer horrible privations. The Princess Zubaydah, widow of \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rashid, was driven out of her palace in the Zubaydiyah Fief near the Ka\u1e6drabbul Gate and now joined her son in the Round City, which with the Khuld Palace and the suburbs immediately to the south along the river bank, became the last refuge of Am\u012bn and the garrison.\n\nLittle by little the line hemming them in was drawn tighter, and all efforts to break through failed. A great fight took place in the Kun\u0101sah Quarter, and the garrison attempted a sally in the neighbourhood of the road called the Darb-al-Hij\u0101rah beyond the Mu\u1e25awwal Gate, on which occasion T\u0101hir came near to lose his life, but the besieged, after performing prodigies of valour, were again driven back. In order to facilitate the despatch of reinforcements to and from the army under Harthamah on the eastern river bank, T\u0101hir had moored a new Bridge of Boats across the Tigris above Baghdad. He now ordered a general attack to\nbe made by Harthamah on the east side, and the Khur\u0101s\u0101n Gate of the Shamm\u0101siyah having been taken by storm, this immediately led to the fall of East Baghdad. The siege had begun before the end of the year 196 A.H., and it was in the beginning of 198 that Harthamah having at length become master of Ru\u1e63afah, Shamm\u0101siyah, and Mukharrim, namely the three quarters which lay on the Persian side of the Tigris, now proceeded to cut the main Bridge of Boats, and thus isolate the City of Mans\u016br.\n\nMeanwhile in Western Baghdad, when it was seen that the defence was failing, the merchants had begun to parley, and the troops of Amin were ever deserting in increasing number. T\u0101hir, who already occupied the Quarters on the southern side of the Round City, namely the Sharqiyah, with Karkh and its great markets, had recently succeeded in destroying the two masonry bridges\u2014the Old Bridge and the New\u2014over the Sar\u0101t Canal, by which the highroads from the K\u016bfah and Ba\u1e63rah Gates passed out into the suburbs. The unfortunate Caliph Am\u012bn now finally retired, with his mother Zubaydah, to the Palace of the Golden Gate in the centre of the Round City, egress to the Tigris being still preserved through the Khuld Palace and its gardens; but here the western river bank was already commanded by the catapults of Harthamah, whose troops had occupied the whole eastern side, and T\u0101hir now began to invest the walls of the Round City. His lines, we are told by Tabari, ran from the Tigris at the foot of the Khuld Gardens, up the Sar\u0101t Canal, past the Ba\u1e63rah Gate to the K\u016bfah Gate, and thence turned north back to the river, after blocking the Syrian Gate, the Tigris bank being regained immediately above the Khuld Palace.\n\nThe end could not long be delayed. The Khuld Palace on the river had to be deserted, having become untenable from the stones shot by the catapults which Harthamah had planted in the Mukharrim Quarter; and Am\u012bn, after a vain attempt to find shelter by shutting himself up in the Palace of the Golden Gate, was driven to surrender. Fearing Harthamah less than T\u0101hir, Am\u012bn set out in secret\nand embarked to cross the river to the camp of the besiegers on the east side, but by ill-chance, or through treachery, the boat was overturned, and the luckless Caliph, after swimming to shore and again seeking shelter on the western bank, was taken prisoner by the enemy's troops. Forthwith, by order of T\u0101hir, he was put to death in the garden near the Anb\u0101r Gate, his head being despatched to Mam\u016bn in Khur\u0101s\u0101n as a proof that the war was now at an end.\n\nThe reign of Mam\u016bn, who some months after these events arrived in Baghdad, witnessed the rebuilding of the half-ruined capital; but the Round City would appear never to have recovered from the effects of this disastrous siege, and Mam\u016bn, when resident in Baghdad, for the most part lived in the Barmecide Palace below the Mukharrim Quarter on the east bank, which, after having been greatly enlarged by the Waz\u012br \u1e24asan Ibn Sahl, now came to be known as the \u1e24asan\u012b Palace.\n\nAfter the death of Mam\u016bn and the accession of his brother Mu'ta\u1e63im, the riotous behaviour of the Turkish Body Guard ultimately forced that Caliph to betake himself to S\u0101marr\u0101, which for a time became the capital of the Caliphate. Here Mu'ta\u1e63im, and after his death six of the succeeding Caliphs, reigned and built palaces, while successive Captains of the Guard controlled the affairs of the Empire at their pleasure. This was the second period in the history of the Abbasids, namely that of the long tyranny of the Turkish Guard, which only came to an end with the advent of the Buyid Princes. While the Caliphs lived at S\u0101marr\u0101, Baghdad was under the rule of governors, mostly T\u0101hirids; for T\u0101hir, after bringing Amin to his death, had prudently retired from the court of Mam\u016bn to live as a semi-independent Prince in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, where he died in 207 (822 A.D.), and in the next generation, during the period when the Caliphs were the puppets of the Body Guard, various members of this great family occupied the chief provincial governorships throughout the Abbasid dominions. Thus while T\u0101hir was succeeded by his immediate descendants, to the third generation, in the principality of\nKhur\u0101s\u0101n, one T\u0101hirid cousin was governor of Baghdad and another superintended affairs in the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina, while Khuw\u0101rizm (modern Khiva), the Herat province, with Tabarist\u0101n and Juzj\u0101n on the Caspian Sea, were all under the rule of such deputies as the head, for the time being, of this powerful house chose to appoint.\n\nThe period of fifty-eight years during which the Caliphate had its seat at S\u0101marr\u0101 was interrupted in 251 (865 A.D.) by the episode of the flight to Baghdad of the Caliph Musta'\u012bn, who made this attempt to escape from the tyranny of the Turkish Guard. Then followed the second siege of Baghdad, of about a year's duration, Musta'\u012bn making a stubborn resistance against the troops despatched from S\u0101marr\u0101 by his cousin, the rival Caliph Mu'tazz, whom the Captain of the Guard had set up in his place. During this second siege, Baghdad was defended by Muhammad ibn 'Abd-Allah, a grandson of T\u0101hir, who, rather more than half a century before, had besieged the city in the interests of Mam\u016bn; but on this occasion it was Rus\u0101sfah or East Baghdad that became the headquarters of the defence, not West Baghdad with the Round City, as had been the case in the time of Am\u012bn. For the details of this siege, also, we are indebted to the pages of Tabari,\u00b9 who possibly himself witnessed some of the incidents that he describes, since he must have been nearly thirty years of age at the date in question.\n\nAs soon as Musta'\u012bn had reached Rus\u0101sfah he ordered the Governor, Muhammad the T\u0101hirid, to block the roads leading from S\u0101marr\u0101 by cutting the dykes of the canals above Baghdad, and he next set to work to surround both the Eastern City and the Western with walls. As already said, the Caliph had his headquarters in Rus\u0101sfah, and on the east side the new wall began at the Shamm\u0101s-iy\u0101h Gate on the Tigris bank, some distance above the Palace of Mahdi, where Musta'\u012bn now lodged. Sweeping round through\n\n\u00b9 Tabari, iii, 1553 to 1578.\na quarter of a circle, past the Barad\u0101n Gate to the Khur\u0101s\u0101n Gate at the town end of the great highroad leading to Persia and the East, the new wall thus enclosed the Ru\u1e63afah and Shamm\u0101siyah Quarters; then curving back through another quarter circle, it included the Mukharrim Quarter, and finally came to the Tigris bank again at the Gate of the Tuesday Market. In West Baghdad the wall began at the Gate of the Fief of Zubaydah, so as to include the Upper Harbour, and passing to the Ka\u1e6drabbul Gate followed up the line of the Trench of \u1e6c\u0101hir, probably as far as the Anb\u0101r Gate\u2014the B\u0101b-al-\u1e24adid (the Iron Gate) being especially mentioned during the siege operations. From the Trench the wall curved down in a great semi-circle, enclosing the City of Man\u1e63\u016br, until it rejoined the Tigris some distance to the east of the Ba\u1e63rah Gate, near the Palace of Humayd. The exact line followed by the wall between the \u1e6c\u0101hirid Trench and the Palace of \u1e24umayd is, unfortunately, not given. A ditch was dug outside the line of wall wheresoever no canal already existed, and the total cost of these fortifications is reported to have amounted to 330,000 din\u0101rs or gold pieces, equivalent to about \u00a3160,000.\n\nThe main attack on the part of the besieging troops from S\u0101marr\u0101 was directed against the Shamm\u0101siyah Gate on the east side, and against the Ka\u1e6drabbul Gate on the west bank; but from the wall of the Fief of Zubaydah, and along the Trench, the defenders greatly harassed their opponents by stones from the catapults erected over the various gateways. At the end of several months of blockade a general assault was finally ordered by the besiegers, who made their attack all along the line from the Y\u0101siriyah Quarter and the Anb\u0101r Gate on the west, to the Khur\u0101s\u0101n Gate at the eastern extremity of the Shamm\u0101siyah Quarter. The attack succeeded, for after the Upper Bridge of Boats had been burnt, the defences were at length carried, and Musta\u02bf\u012bn being now driven out of Ru\u1e63afah, was taken prisoner and forced to abdicate. Before long he came to his death at the hands of his captors, and the Turk Body\nGuard then returned victorious to their nominal sovereign Mu'tazz in S\u0101marr\u0101, whom three years later they likewise deposed and murdered.\n\nAs has already been pointed out, the partial ruin of Western Baghdad, more especially of the Round City of Man\u1e63\u016br, had followed as the result of the first siege in the time of Amin. This second siege under Musta'in now brought about the ruin of the three Northern Quarters of East Baghdad, namely Rus\u0101fah, Samm\u0101siyah, and Mukharrim. The Turkish Body Guard had for the time triumphed, but before another thirty years had elapsed, events occurred which caused S\u0101marr\u0101 to be deserted by the Caliphs, and Mu'tadid (nephew of Mu'tazz), who succeeded to the throne in 279 (892 A.D.), permanently re-established the Caliphate in the older capital. Settling in East Baghdad, he laid the foundations of the great complex of Palaces which stood on the Tigris bank below the Mukharrim Quarter, forming the great \u1e24ar\u012bm, or Haramayn (the Precincts), which was afterwards commonly known as the D\u016br-al-Khil\u0101fah (the Abode of the Caliphate). These Precincts became the nucleus of the later city, which developed from the line of suburbs spreading round the land side of the great Palace of the Caliphs. This was walled in at a later date, and at the present time still exists, forming the modern city of Baghdad on the east bank of the Tigris.\n\nIt is to the writers who flourished during the last quarter of the third century (the ninth A.D.), namely Ya'\u1e33\u016bb\u012b, Ibn Rustah and Ibn Serapion, that we owe our first, and indeed our only systematic descriptions of Baghdad. Ya'\u1e33\u016bb\u012b begins by describing the Round City as originally founded in the reign of Man\u1e63\u016br, and then passes on to a detailed account of its suburbs, concluding with a brief notice of the three Eastern Quarters of Rus\u0101fah, Shamm\u0101siyah, and Mukharrim. The description of the canals given by our next authority, Ibn Serapion, supplements Ya'\u1e33\u016bb\u012b, and enables us (as already said) to plot out the topography by a rough system of triangulation; Ibn Rustah adding some\nfew additional details. The critical examination of these three authorities, however, need not now detain us; they form the chief basis of the whole of the description of Baghdad which, in book form, will shortly be published, and their works will there be fully reviewed. Points of detail in the plan of the city are supplemented by incidental notices of events under various years, occurring in the volumes of the great chronicle of Tabari, more especially in his descriptions of the two earlier sieges as already mentioned, and thus the earlier accounts can be filled in and completed.\n\nA matter that must be noted in connection with these and the following descriptions of Baghdad, is the curiously arbitrary way in which the Arab geographers regard the position of the Round City of Mans\u016br in relation to the points of the compass, and to the system of canals and roads that surrounded it. They appear to assume that the Tigris held its course entirely from west to east, and hence lay to the north of the city of Mans\u016br; further, that the \u0160ar\u0101t Canal (branching from the \u1e2a\u012b\u1e63\u0101 Canal) ran in a direction from south to north before flowing out into the Tigris, and thus passed to the east of the Round City. On these suppositions, which a glance at the map will show only agree very partially with the facts of the case, all the earlier topographical descriptions are based. Thus the B\u0101dur\u0101y\u0101 District is spoken of as lying east of the \u0160ar\u0101t, while the Ka\u1e6drabbul District was to the west of this stream; we, on the other hand, should rather have said that these districts (respectively above and below the Round City) lay to the south and north of the \u0160ar\u0101t. Again, Ya\u02bfk\u016bb\u012b, in describing the suburbs near the Mu\u1e25awwal Gate states that along the \u0160ar\u0101t, going up-stream south (we should say west), there are certain Fiefs lying to the westward (we should say north) of this canal, and he always refers to the City of Mans\u016br as occupying its western bank. This arbitrary view in regard to the main points of the compass must probably account for the reference made by Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b to the B\u0101b-al-\u1e24adid (the Iron Gate) on the \u1e6c\u0101hirid Trench as a gate\nof Baghdad that opened \"towards the south,\" the explanation being that since the Trench must curve away at nearly a right angle on leaving the Sar\u0101t, the Gates along its upper course were described as opening \"towards the south,\" because the Trench which bifurcated from the Sar\u0101t was held to flow west before turning north to flow into the Tigris in a course parallel to that of its parent stream the Sar\u0101t.\n\nTo complete the list of our earliest authorities it remains to be mentioned that, besides his work on Geography (giving us the detailed description of Baghdad), Ya'k\u016bb\u012b also wrote a History, which he finished in the year 260 (874 A.D.); and dating from rather more than half-a-century later we have the celebrated work called \"The Meadows of Gold\" by Mas'\u016bd\u012b. From the pages of both these historical works, as from the chronicle of Tabari already mentioned, innumerable small details may be gleaned for the topography of Baghdad, which, though incidental and fragmentary, are often invaluable for fixing minor points.\n\nThe half-century which followed on the return of the Caliphs to Baghdad, and which preceded the advent of the Buyids, witnessed the completion of the three great palaces, the Fird\u016bs, the Hasani, and the T\u0101j, with the Mosque of the Caliph, in the southern part of East Baghdad along the river bank. These palaces, it will be remembered, lay immediately to the south of the Gate of the Tuesday Market in the city wall, which Musta'in had built during the second siege; and before long East Baghdad thus came to be almost doubled in area. During the later years of the third century (the ninth A.D.) this older wall, which ran in a semicircle round the three northern quarters of Rus\u1e6d\u0101jah, Shamm\u0101siyah, and Mukharrim, must either have been purposely destroyed or else have been allowed to fall to ruin, for the new quarters round the Palaces in part overlapped the Mukharrim Quarter. Meanwhile, in the\n\n1 Instances are too numerous for reference in full, but the following will be sufficient to prove what is stated above.

The period of the Buyid\nsupremacy lasted for rather more than a century, and was characterized by the erection of many fine buildings in the capital of the Caliphate. The Buyid Princes were Persian by descent and Shi'ah by sympathy; they had subjugated both Mesopotamia and the region now known as Persia, where various members of the family occupied the provincial governments, while the Prince, who was the head of the house, as a rule made Baghdad his residence, and from this centre of government controlled the Caliph, and in his name strove to dominate all Eastern Islam.\n\nThe Buyid Princes built their Palaces in East Baghdad on the ground formerly occupied by the Shamm\u0101siyah and part of the Mukharrim Quarters; and these Palaces, which their successors the Saljuq Princes took over and enlarged, were known by the name of the D\u0101r-as-Sultanah (the Abode of the Sultanate). The buildings were begun under Mu'tizz-ad-Dawlah the Buyid, who had especially entitled himself to the lasting gratitude of the people of Baghdad by erecting a huge Dyke which, when kept in repair, prevented the inundation of the city by the flooding of the streams flowing out into the Tigris at the Shamm\u0101siyah lowlands. At a later date his nephew and successor 'Ad\u016bd-ad-Dawlah built a hospital in West Baghdad on the ruins of the Khuld Palace, and this for three centuries was a school of medical science which became famous throughout the East under the name of the Bimarist\u0101n 'Ad\u016bd\u012b (the Hospital of 'Adud-ad-Dawlah).\n\nDuring the century of the Buyid supremacy we have the three first names in the long list of the Arab geographers, namely, I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri, Ibn-Hawkal, and Mu\u1e33addasi, each of whom gives a succinct description of Baghdad. The geography of I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri, who wrote in 340 (951 A.D.), was re-edited and enlarged by Ibn-Hawkal in 367 (978 A.D.); but as regards Baghdad, the two accounts are practically identical, except for very few minor details. They describe East Baghdad as almost entirely taken up by the palaces,\n\n1 I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri, 83; Ibn-Hawkal, 164.\nnamely, in the first place by the Palaces of the Caliph, or \u1e24ar\u012bm (the royal precincts), these extending south with their gardens as far down as the Nahr Bin two leagues distant from the centre of the town; and secondly, by the great Palace of the Buyid Sultan in the upper part of the city. The walls of these various palaces are said to have formed a continuous line along the Tigris bank from the Shamm\u0101siyah Quarter down-stream for a distance of about five miles. Opposite the Shannm\u0101siyah of the eastern bank lay the Harbiyah Quarter in West Baghdad, and below this was Karkh, which further had given its name in general parlance to all that half of Baghdad which lay to the west of the Tigris; East Baghdad being still known as the Ru\u1e63afah side, or as the quarter of the B\u0101b-at-\u1e6c\u0101\u1e33, from the great arched gate of this name at the head of the Main Bridge.\n\nI\u1e63\u1e6dakhri mentions three great Friday Mosques as in use at his date, namely, the Mosque of Ru\u1e63afah, and that of the Palace of the Caliph in East Baghdad, with the old Mosque of the City of Mans\u016br in West Baghdad; while Ibn-Hawkal (a quarter of a century later) adds a fourth, this having come into use by his time, namely, the Mosque at Bar\u0101th\u0101 on the road to Mu\u1e25awwal town, originally a shrine dedicated to the Caliph \u2018Al\u012b, whom the Shi\u2018ahs more especially hold in honour. In Kalw\u0101dh\u0101 also, a league distance down the river on the east side, there was at this date a great Mosque which might rightfully be considered as belonging to Baghdad, seeing that the houses of the Eastern City were continuous from below the Palaces of the Caliph to this outlying township. Both I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri and Ibn-Hawkal, in spite of the numerous new-built palaces, deplore the ruin which had already befallen so many quarters; thus I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri writes that all the road between the Main Bridge and the eastern Khur\u0101s\u0101n Gate had in former times been occupied by houses, but that in his time these for the most part were already in ruin.\n\nIn Western Baghdad, Karkh is said still to be the most populous and best preserved quarter, and here the merchants\nwho lived at the Y\u0101sir\u012byah suburb had their houses of business. I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri then proceeds to give a detailed account (copied without acknowledgement by all subsequent authorities) of the \u2018\u012as\u0101 Canal, flowing through Karkh, which was navigable for boats all the way from the Euphrates to the Tigris; its numerous unnavigable branches, namely the \u1e62ar\u0101t Canal and other minor channels, ramifying throughout the adjacent quarters. The extreme breadth across both halves of the city (East and West Baghdad) I\u1e63\u1e6dakhri gives at five miles (the same as the length given for the Palace walls along the eastern river bank), and his account concludes with the remark that the gardens of the Palaces of the Caliph and others, in East Baghdad, were almost entirely irrigated by water-channels derived from the Nahraw\u0101n Canal, since the Tigris ran at too low a level for its waters to be brought into the city, except by the mechanical contrivance of the water-wheel, called D\u016bl\u0101b, which involved much labour.\n\nThe account of Baghdad written by Mukaddasi in 375 (985 A.D.) is less interesting than might have been expected from the other portions of his excellent and original work. He mentions few topographical details, but after expatiating on the many advantages of position and climate which Mans\u016br gained by selecting this particular site for his capital, he passes on to lament the present ruin of the great city, which he fears will soon rival S\u0101marr\u0101 in its state of chronic insurrection and infamous misrule. In Karkh, on the west bank, he mentions the Fief of Rabi\u2018 as the most populous quarter, and states that on this side were to be found most of the Markets and fine houses still standing in spite of the general decay. He speaks of the Hospital lately built by \u2018Adud-ad-Dawlah opposite the Bridge of Boats leading to East Baghdad; and in this other half of the city the best preserved quarters were, he says, those lying round the B\u0101b-at-T\u0101k (the great Arch at the Bridgehead), and near the D\u0101r-al-Am\u012br, namely the\n\n1 Mu\u1e33addasi, 119.\nPalace of the Buyid Princes recently built over part of the Shamm\u0101siyah Quarter.\n\n\u2018Adud-ad-Dawlah had died in Baghdad during the year 372 (982 A.D.), a short time before Mukaddasi wrote this description, and he was buried (as all good Shi'ahs should be) at Mashhad \u2018Ali, the celebrated shrine on the Euphrates, where the grave of the Caliph \u2018Ali was said to have been made. After the death of \u2018Adud-ad-Dawlah the Buyid power declined, and a period of internecine war followed, which only ended in 447 (1055 A.D.), when Tughril Beg, the Salj\u016bk, after suppressing the last Buyid Prince, became master of Baghdad. With him begins the period of the Salj\u016bk supremacy (the fourth period in the history of Abbasids), which lasted about a century, and is celebrated for the acts and deeds of Alp Arsl\u0101n and Malik Sh\u0101h. The Salj\u016bks were of the Turk race (the Buyids had been Persians), and unlike their predecessors, the Salj\u016bk Princes for the most part did not reside in Baghdad, but maintained there a deputy who acted as their Lieutenant-Governor of Mesopotamia. He resided in Baghdad, occupying the Buyid Palace now generally called the Palace of the Sultanate; thus Baghdad already in Salj\u016bk times was no longer nominally even the seat of government in the East.\n\nDating from the earlier years of the Salj\u016bk period we have a work called \u201cThe History of Baghdad,\u201d written by Kha\u1e6d\u012bb in 450 (1058 A.D.), which still unfortunately remains in MS. It is full of interesting details in regard to the origin and position of the various buildings in both the western and eastern quarters of the city, and much of it has been copied, without any acknowledgement, by later compilers, such as Y\u0101k\u016bt. This work of Kha\u1e6d\u012bb contains, for instance, the account of the Greek Embassy to Baghdad in the year 305 (917 A.D.),\u00b9 with the description of the\n\n\u00b9 See J.R.A.S. for 1897, p. 35. The full name of the writer is Ahmad ibn \u2018Ali al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b, and I have adopted the name Kha\u1e6d\u012bb, meaning the \u201cPreacher,\u201d merely for convenience of brevity. The British Museum has three MSS. of his work, and there is also another good copy in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale in Paris. The MS. which is referred to in the following pages is that numbered Or. 1607 of the British Museum Catalogue.\nPalaces of the Caliphs in the time of Mukta\u1e0dir, and though Kh\u0101\u1e6dib is in great part merely a compiler, his book is a compilation at first hand citing authorities, which is more than unfortunately can be said of the works of many later writers.\n\nThe century of the S\u0101li\u1e25\u012bk supremacy witnessed the great expansion of East Baghdad, for during the reign of Mu\u1e25ammad (fifth in descent from Mukta\u1e0dir) suburbs were founded and grew up round the Palaces of the Caliph which in the reign of his son and successor Musta\u1e93hir were surrounded by the city wall that still exists. As showing the wide extent of the metropolis on both banks of the river before the reign of Musta\u1e93hir, Kh\u0101\u1e6dib reports that when he lived in Baghdad there were six Great Mosques where the Public Prayers were always said on the Friday. These were four in West Baghdad, namely, the Mosque of \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn in the \u1e24ar\u016bn Gate Quarter, the Mosque of the \u1e62af\u0101r\u0101n Quarter, that of the Fief of Zubaydah, and the Mosque of Sa\u02bfd\u0101b\u0101h half-way to Mu\u1e25aww\u0101l on the \u1e2a\u0101\u1e63an Quarter side; in East Baghdad there were only two Friday Prayers, namely, the old Mosque in R\u016bs\u0101t\u0101h and that built by the \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Ali Mukta\u1e0di had built near the \u1e2a\u0101\u1e63an Quarter.\n\nKh\u0101\u1e6dib also gives some important data concerning the size accorded to the houses of Baghdad in his day; fully agreeing what has been told us in the previous century by \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd in effect that the city had then already occupied an area of land measuring five miles across twenty-three inches. The statements found in Kh\u0101\u1e6dib are expressed in terms of the Jar\u012bb, a land measure which was equivalent to sixty-six side. Adopting twenty-three inches as a mean of the various estimates for the length of the side, three Jar\u012bbs and a third may be taken as equivalent to our acre, or in other words ten Jar\u012bbs are\n\n---\n\n1. \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd died between the two Caliphs \u2018Ali Mukta\u1e0di 289 A.D., and \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd 356 A.D., hence the addition of the year 356 to the date given I write Mans\u016br Rash\u012bd 329 (1135) to correspond to that of \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn al-Rash\u012bd 170 (786 A.D.). Kh\u0101\u1e6dib,\nequal to three acres, and the English square mile would contain 2,133 Jaribs.\\(^1\\)\n\nComing now to the statements made by Kha\u1e6d\u012bb we find that three valuations of the area of the city at different epochs are recorded. The earliest dates from the time when Muwaffak, brother of the Caliph Mu\u2018tamid, was in Baghdad\u2014presumably therefore about the year 270 (884 A.D.)\u2014during the Zanj rebellion, while the Caliphs still resided at S\u0101marr\u0101. It is reported that East Baghdad at this time covered 26,250 Jaribs, West Baghdad covering 17,500 Jaribs, of which total the cemeteries counted for 74 Jaribs. These figures give an area of about \\(12\\frac{2}{3}\\) and \\(8\\frac{1}{3}\\) square miles respectively for the two halves of the city, East and West, or 21 square miles in total, the cemeteries occupying rather more than 22 acres of this space.\n\nNext, at some date nearer to the time of Kha\u1e6d\u012bb, which is not exactly specified, but when Baghdad had once more become \u201cthe Abode of the Caliphate,\u201d the numbers recorded are:\u201427,000 Jaribs for East Baghdad, and for the older city on the western bank at one time 26,750 Jaribs, but at another time 16,750 Jaribs, unless, indeed, the higher of these figures be regarded as merely a clerical error for the lower, though as against this supposition it is to be remarked that each figure as cited by Kha\u1e6d\u012bb is vouched for on a separate authority. These figures work out as the equivalent of \\(12\\frac{2}{3}\\) square miles for East Baghdad, and for the lower estimate of the western city somewhat under eight square miles. In round numbers \\(20\\frac{1}{3}\\) square miles for both sides at this lower estimate for West Baghdad, while the sum-total would come up to about twenty-five square miles if we accept the higher figure.\n\nThese calculations cannot of course be regarded as very exact, but the Arabs were, for their time, skilful land surveyors, practising the art for their fiscal assessments and for the laying down of the irrigation canals. Further, as above noted, these figures tend to confirm the estimate\n\n\\(^1\\) For this estimate of the Jar\u012bb compare Mawardi, edited by M. Enger, p. 265. (Bonn, 1853.)\nalready given by Istakhri, which, at five miles across, length and breadth, would give twenty-five square miles for the square, and $19\\frac{1}{4}$ square miles for the area of a circle with this diameter.\\footnote{For the length of the side of the Jarib, namely sixty ells, Khatib uses the term Habl, meaning a \"cord\" or \"rope,\" which apparently is not given in this special sense in our dictionaries, and it may therefore be worth noting.} How much Baghdad has decreased since the times of the Caliphs is apparent from the fact that at the present day East Baghdad is computed to cover an area of 591 acres, while in West Baghdad the remains known as \"the Old Town\" comprise only 146 acres, giving a total for both sides which is equivalent to rather over one square mile and a sixth.\n\nThe Saljuks, as already said, had inherited from their predecessors, the Buyids, the great Palace and Government Offices called the Dar-as-Sultanah in the upper part of the Eastern City. On the south side of this Malik Shah in 485 (1092 A.D.) founded the great Saljuk Mosque known as the Jami-as-Sultan, while at about the same time his Wazir, the celebrated Nizam-al-Mulk, built and endowed the Nizamiyah College on the land by the Tigris bank below the Palaces of the Caliph. These buildings both date from the reign of the Caliph Mukhtadi\u2014467 to 487 (1075 to 1094 A.D.)\u2014in whose time also many new quarters were laid out to the north and east of the Palaces of the Caliphs, which quarters before long came to form the new town of East Baghdad. In 488 (1095 A.D.) at the beginning of the reign of the next Caliph, Mustazhir, this New City, lying about a mile below the Saljuk Palaces was surrounded by a wall pierced by four gates, which wall (as proved by the gates) is identical in its main lines with the present town wall of modern Baghdad.\n\nThe Caliphate, even before the beginning of the Saljuk period, had already sunk into political insignificance, and the Caliphs having much spare time and considerable revenues employed their energies in palace building. It is indeed mainly to this period that the great Harim, or Precinct, as their residence came to be called, owes its\nmagnificence, as described in the pages of Y\u0101k\u016bt. He mentions in particular the great Rayh\u0101niyin (the Palace on the Perfumers' Market) and the second Palace of the Crown (Ka\u1e63r-at-T\u0101j), both of which were built at the close of the Salj\u016bk period.\n\nIn the year 530 (1136 A.D.), under the Caliph Mans\u016br R\u0101shid (not to be confounded with H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd), Baghdad sustained a third siege, of only two months' duration however, by an army under command of Sultan Mas\u02bf\u016bd the Salj\u016bk. The Sultan, who had pitched his siege camp at the M\u0101likiyah, found no difficulty in investing the city, for the Governor of W\u0101sit on the lower Tigris, sent him up reinforcements by boat which shut in the Caliph from the river side, while the populace, taking advantage of the troubles, rose in insurrection, plundered the quarters of the Western City, and sacked the Palace called the T\u0101hirid \u1e24ar\u012bm, where, it is said, they gained an immense booty. After a blockade of fifty days, the Caliph Mans\u016br R\u0101shid finally fled to Mosul, and was there forced to abdicate, his uncle, Mu\u1e25ammad Mu\u1e33taf\u012b, being set up in his place, and Sultan Mas\u02bf\u016bd retired with his army eastward.\u00b9\n\nA fourth siege took place twenty-one years later during the reign of the Caliph Mu\u1e25ammad Mu\u1e33taf\u012b, whose relations with Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad, nephew and successor of Sultan Mas\u02bf\u016bd aforesaid, had become so strained in 551 A.H. that the Salj\u016bk Sultan, marching into \u2018Ir\u0101k, appeared with his army before the walls of Baghdad in the month Dhu-l-Ka\u02bfdah of that year (January, 1157 A.D.). The Caliph forthwith shut himself up in East Baghdad, where a great store of munitions and provisions by his orders had already been brought together, and the city walls were well provided with both catapults and mangonels, the towers being garrisoned by cross-bowmen. Further, barges, also carrying cross-bowmen and catapults, were set to patrol the Tigris, where the Bridges of Boats had been taken up in order thoroughly to guard the river side of the Eastern City.\n\n\u00b9 The details of the third siege of Baghdad are given by Ibn-al-Ath\u012br, xi, 26.\nMarching down the great Khur\u0101s\u0101n road, Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad effected a junction with his Lieutenant, the Governor of Mosul, and himself crossed the Tigris above Baghdad. The attack was delivered in two divisions, namely, from the western quarter and from the north-east, where part of the Salj\u016bk army occupied the great Palace of the Sultans outside the city wall. Up-stream, above Baghdad, Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad had already spanned the Tigris by a new Bridge of Boats, thus conveniently to connect the two portions of his army. His own headquarters were on the Sar\u0101t Canal, and from time to time he himself crossed to the Palace of the Sultans in order to urge on the siege operations. In East Baghdad the city walls were closely invested by his troops, in spite of frequent sallies from within the town, and the besiegers shortly after their arrival were reinforced from \u1e24illah, K\u016bfah, W\u0101sit, and Ba\u1e63rah. In spite of numbers, however, they made but little progress, and at the end of two months the Sultan found that his advanced positions had come to be so harassed by the mangonels of the townspeople that he was forced to shift his headquarter camp in West Baghdad, and retire westward to the line of the \u1e6c\u0101s\u0101 Canal. His troops had more than once made an attack against the river front of East Baghdad, where there was no city wall, only the line of the great Palaces and gardens of the Caliph; but coming to the assault in their boats they were always beaten off by the Baghdad people, and they had lost many of their best men.\n\nMeanwhile in the month Safar of 532 (March, 1137 A.D.) the Hajj Caravan from Mecca arrived on its return journey, and the Pilgrims were much scandalized at the spectacle of the Commander of the Faithful being assaulted in his own capital by the Salj\u016bk Sultan. Further, in the course of the last two months, the Caliph Muktafi had successfully turned the arts of diplomacy against his adversary, and Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad, in addition to the ill-success of the siege, now found himself threatened by treason at home, where a relative was working to supplant him in his capital city of Hamad\u0101n. Matters now went rapidly from bad to\nworse, and in the following month of Rabi\u2018 1 (April), after having been rather more than three months encamped before Baghdad, Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad in despair precipitately raised the siege. He had first to cross the Tigris by his new bridge above the Palace of the Sultans, before he could set out for Hamad\u0101n with his body-guard and personal followers, but his retreat being ill-organized, he came near to lose his baggage at the passage of the Bridge of Boats. The people of Baghdad, hearing of his departure, came pouring out of the city, stormed and sacked the Palace of the Sultans\u2014the gates of which they tore off, burning all the furniture within its precincts\u2014and then suddenly advancing, the mob cut the communications between the body-guard of the Sultan and his army, which still remained encamped in West Baghdad. Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad, however, only delayed to recover his personal baggage, and then hastened his retreat along the Khur\u0101s\u0101n highroad towards Hamad\u0101n, leaving the main body of his army under the command of the Governor of Mosul to settle matters as they could. These were still in force on the western bank, but finding they were thus abandoned, the troops promptly retired north on Mosul, without any further molestation at the hands of the Baghdad people.\n\nThe details of this siege, of which the foregoing is a condensed account, are graphically related by the contemporary historian \u2018Im\u0101d-ad-D\u012bn of Isfahan, who was in Baghdad at the time, and took the occasion of the retreat to indite a congratulatory ode to the Caliph Muktafi on the success of his arms. The account, it is true, adds little to our topographical knowledge, but in the dearth of contemporary writers it is not without interest.\u00b9 A notice of this fourth siege is also recorded in the Chronicle of Ibn-al-Ath\u012br, who becomes our best general authority for Baghdad after the middle of the fourth century (the tenth A.D.)\u2014when \u1e6cabar\u012b and his continuator \u2018Arib have closed their annals\u2014and this Chronicle carries us down to\n\n\u00b9 \u2018Im\u0101d-ad-D\u012bn, ii, 246 to 255 (in Recueil des Textes relatifs \u00e0 l'histoire des Seljoucides par M. Th. Houtsma, Leyden, 1889); Ibn-al-Ath\u012br, xi, 140.\nthe year 628 (1230 A.D.), namely to the reign of the father of the last Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad.\n\nThe Salj\u016bk supremacy may be said virtually to have come to an end with the death of Sultan Sanjar, the last of the great Salj\u016bks, in 552 (1157 A.D.); after which began the fifth and last period in the history of Baghdad. This was characterized by the almost complete political insignificance of the Abbasid Caliphs; and the Caliphate, after a century of this dotage, came to an end with the Mongol invasion under H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b in 656 (1258 A.D.). During this period the Caliphs were chiefly occupied in pulling down and rebuilding ephemeral palaces, and with laying out gardens within the \u1e24ar\u012bm walls, all of which futilities appear to have greatly impressed the Persian Poet Kh\u0101k\u0101n\u012b, who visited Baghdad in 550 (1155 A.D.) on his pilgrimage to Mecca. He has left us a very rhetorical description (useless, unfortunately, for topographical purposes) of what he saw in \"the Abode of the Caliphate\": the gardens, he says, are the equal of those of Paradise; the waters of the Tigris, which are only comparable in their pellucidness to the Tears of the Virgin Mary, flow round past the Karkh Quarter, and the river surface is everywhere covered with boats which Kh\u0101k\u0101n\u012b likens to the Cradle of Jesus for their grace of build. With a good deal more in this style of bombast, and avoiding any detailed description of the town or its palaces, Kh\u0101k\u0101n\u012b concludes his poem with a long panegyric of the Caliph Mu\u1e25ammad Mu\u1e33\u1e6daf\u012b, and of the various learned persons whom he saw in Baghdad.\u00b9\n\nBenjamin of Tudela, the Jewish traveller, visited Baghdad a few years after the time of Kh\u0101k\u0101n\u012b, approximately in 555 (1160 A.D.), but his narrative gives us little topographical information, since his attention is wholly directed to enumerating the settlements of his co-religionists in Babylonia. He states, however, that in his time the Caliph only left his Palace once a year, namely, on the great\n\n\u00b9 Kh\u0101k\u0101n\u012b, p. 91, of the Lithographed Lucknow edition of 1294 (1877 A.D.). I have to thank my friend Professor E. G. Browne, of Cambridge, for the loan of this work, which I should otherwise have failed to see.\nFeast Day at the close of the Ramad\u0101n Fast, when setting forth in procession he visited the Mosque near the Ba\u1e63rah Gate, which same Benjamin of Tudela says was the Metropolitan Mosque of the City. The J\u0101mi\u2018 of the older City of Mans\u016br is evidently the place here designated; but it may be questioned (comparing this with the account left us by Ibn Jubayr a quarter of a century later) whether either the Caliph Mu\u1e25ammad Muktafi or Mustanjid really maintained the seclusion of which Benjamin of Tudela speaks.\u00b9\n\nContrasting with the futilities of the Persian Kh\u0101k\u0101ni are the graphic descriptions given us by the Spanish Arab Ibn Jubayr who visited Baghdad some thirty years later, namely, in 580 (1184 A.D.). He was then on his way back from Mecca, and came up the great K\u016bfah highroad from the south, having crossed the Euphrates at \u1e24illah by the Bridge of Boats, recently established here by the Caliph N\u0101\u1e63ir for the convenience of the Pilgrims, who formerly had had to cross the great river in a ferry. After leaving the Euphrates, Ibn Jubayr passed through the town of \u0160arsar on the canal of that name, and entered Baghdad on the third day of the month Safar, 580 (17th May, 1184), alighting in the suburb of West Baghdad called the Kurayyah, which lay over against the Ni\u1e93\u0101miyah College of the Eastern City.\u00b2\n\nIbn Jubayr devotes many pages to the account of what he did during the fortnight of his sojourn in the capital of the Caliph N\u0101\u1e63ir, whom he had the honour of seeing on more than one occasion. He describes West Baghdad as being for the greater part in ruin. Its four most populous quarters were: first, the Kurayyah suburb near the (later) Bridge of Boats, the best built in the first instance and the least dilapidated; next to this was Karkh surrounded by its own wall; and above lay the quarter of the Ba\u1e63rah Gate (for what still remained of the Round\n\n\u00b9 \"The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela,\" i, 97 (in Hebrew and English, by A. Asher, 1840).\n\u00b2 \"The Travels of Ibn Jubayr,\" edited by W. Wright, p. 219.\nCity had now come to be known by the name of its southeastern Gate) with the Great Mosque of Mans\u016br, still used for the Friday Prayers; lastly, the quarter called the Sh\u0101ri\u02bf (the Highway) along the Tigris bank above the \u2018Adudi Hospital, the market of which connected the Sh\u0101ri\u02bf Quarter with the suburb of the Bagrah Gate. Other, but less populous, quarters of West Baghdad were: the Harbiyah, the highest on the river bank, and adjacent thereto the \u2018Amiliyyah Quarter, or the \u2018Amiliyy\u016bn. This last perpetuated the name of \u2018Am\u012bl, great-grandson of Omayyad (the ancestor of the Omayyad Caliphs), and \u2018Att\u0101b, who was a contemporary of the Prophet, and been named by Muhammad as Governor of Mecca, a post which he also continued to hold during the reign of the Caliph Abu Bakr. The quarter of Baghdad which bore his name appears to have been occupied by his descendants who had settled there at an earlier period, and the name of the \u2018Att\u0101biyyah survives, though not world-wide renown by reason of the \u2018Att\u0101biyyah (in Europe called Tabby), which were in Baghdad in this suburb. Further, Ibn Jubayr says that near Karkh near the Bagrah Gate stood a mosque of the Im\u0101m M\u016bs\u0101 in the great city. It was known now as the K\u016bzimayn, this being surrounded by the graves of many distinguished\n\n---\n\nThe article goes on to describe the layout and features of Baghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate, focusing on the various quarters and their significance. It mentions the Great Mosque of Mans\u016br, the Sh\u0101ri\u02bf Quarter, the Harbiyah, and the \u2018Amiliyyah Quarter, among others. The text also discusses the role of \u2018Am\u012bl and \u2018Att\u0101b in Baghdad's history and how their names were perpetuated through the \u2018Att\u0101biyyah Quarter. Finally, it refers to a mosque of the Im\u0101m M\u016bs\u0101 located near Karkh and known as the K\u016bzimayn.\nAcross the river in East Baghdad, and opposite the K\u0101z\u012bnayn, was the Quarter round the Tomb of Abu \u1e24an\u012bfah, lying above Rus\u0101fah and its great Mosque, and round this last were seen the sepulchres of many other holy men, and more celebrated still the Tombs of the Caliphs. At a considerable distance below Rus\u0101fah came the Palaces of the Caliph, covering an area estimated at more than a quarter of the whole of the Eastern City, and the royal precincts were encircled by the various palaces of the Abbasid nobles, so to speak \"imprisoned in their grandeur.\" Ibn Jubayr was much struck by the beauty of the gardens in this quarter; but he remarks that the markets of East Baghdad were almost entirely supplied by the produce of the lands under cultivation on the opposite or western bank. There were three Great Mosques for the Friday Prayers in use in East Baghdad when Ibn Jubayr was there, namely, the Mosque of the Caliph within the Palace; the Mosque of the Sultan, which lay outside to the north of the Gate of the Sultan in the City wall, and standing in front of the Salj\u016bk Palaces; and lastly the Rus\u0101fah Mosque, which stood a mile distant from the Mosque of the Sultan aforesaid, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Shrine of Abu \u1e24an\u012bfah.\n\nIn the whole of Baghdad Ibn Jubayr further counted eleven Mosques where the Friday Prayers were said, and of Hamm\u0101ns or Hot-baths, so many that none could tell their number; one person assuring him that there were over two thousand, and he adds that in these the halls were so finely plastered with bitumen, brought from Ba\u1e63rah, that the visitor imagined the walls to be lined with slabs of black marble. Of Colleges\u2014each more magnificent than a palace\u2014over thirty were to be counted, the greatest being the Niz\u0101miyah, which had been recently restored. Lastly, Ibn Jubayr describes the city wall with its four gates, which went in a semi-circle round East Baghdad, from the Tigris bank above to the river again below the city quarters; and this wall, as already said, is virtually identical with the present wall round modern Baghdad, for one of the\nextant gates still bears an inscription set up by the Caliph Nasir, who was reigning when Ibn Jubayr visited Baghdad.\n\nTowards the close of the reign of this same Caliph Nasir, and about the year 623 (1226 A.D.), Y\u016bk\u016bt wrote his great Geographical Dictionary (the articles arranged in alphabetical order), which forms, perhaps, the greatest storehouse of geographical facts compiled by any one man during the Middle Ages. He knew Baghdad intimately, having been brought up there, but wrote at a distance, compiling uncritically, and hence in minor points of detail he is sometimes guilty of egregious blunders. His descriptions of the various Palaces of the Caliphs are invaluable, but his statements concerning the relative positions of places and quarters in Baghdad, especially in regard to the points of the compass, are both vague and contradictory. If we were without the works of his predecessors, it would be impossible, following his accounts alone, to draw up any consistent plan of Baghdad; but with the earlier systematic descriptions to refer to, enabling us to correct minor errors, the plan of the city having been laid down gains a fulness of detail that would be unattainable without the numerous articles of his Dictionary.\n\nHe describes (under various articles) West Baghdad as consisting in his day of a number of separate quarters, each surrounded by its own wall. Thus the Harbiyah in the northern part of West Baghdad lay like a separate walled town, nearly two miles distant from the remainder of Old Baghdad, and it was surrounded by many waste lands. The Harbiyah also included several minor quarters, and to the west of it lay the separate townships of the Chah\u0101r S\u016bj, the \"Four Markets,\" and the 'Att\u0101biyah, as already noticed by Ibn Jubayr. At some distance to the south of the Harbiyah stood the Old Mosque of Mans\u016br, which was included in the quarter of the Bayrah Gate, this Gate, as already said, having given its name to what continued to be habitable of the older Round City. The Karkh\u0101y\u0101 Canal had in part disappeared, but the Merchants' Quarter of Karkh remained standing \"a horse gallop\" (or about half-\na-mile) distant from the Ba\u1e63rah Gate Quarter, the population of which last, being of the orthodox Sunn\u012b faith, were the rivals of the Karkh people, who were all bigoted heterodox Shi'ahs.\n\nAdjoining Karkh, and on the Tigris bank, was the Kurayyah and the quarter of the Kallay\u012bn Canal, where fried meats were sold; also the T\u0101bi\u1e33 Canal Quarter, which in the time of Y\u0101k\u016bt had been recently burnt down; and hence, as he says, these were already for the most part merely so many rubbish heaps. The quarter round the Mu\u1e25awwal Gate, lying inland from Karkh and inhabited by Sunnis, who were always at feud with their Shi'ah neighbours, appears to have still retained some of its former opulence; while the town of Mu\u1e25awwal, a league beyond the outer suburbs of West Baghdad, was populous and famous for its excellent markets. The Sh\u016bniz\u012byah Cemetery lay to the south of Karkh, while to the north of the \u1e24arbiyah extended the great burial-ground round the Shrine of the Im\u0101m M\u016bs\u0101, now known as the K\u0101\u1e93imayn.\n\nOn the eastern bank, the centre of population, was the great Palace of the Caliph, described as occupying a third part of the whole area of the city; and all round this lay a network of markets and streets, extending to the city wall, and in places going beyond it. Outside the wall and at some distance to the north, was Ru\u1e63\u0101fah with its Mosque surrounded by the Tombs of the Caliphs; and up-stream, beyond this again, lay the quarter named after the Shrine of Abu \u1e24an\u012bfah, with its own market; and these two outlying suburbs with the neighbouring Christian Quarter, called the D\u0101r-ar-R\u016bm (House of the Greeks), were all that remained habitable in the time of Y\u0101k\u016bt of the older (northern) part of the Eastern City, which formerly had consisted of the three great quarters of Ru\u1e63\u0101fah, Sham-m\u0101siyah, and Mukharrim.\n\nY\u0101k\u016bt, it will be seen by the dates, describes Baghdad for us as the great city stood immediately prior to the Mongol invasion; and the only building of note erected after his time was the Mustans\u012briyah College. This was\nThe Prince of Wales visited India in 1921 and was received by the Maharaja of Mysore at his palace. The Prince attended the Durbar and inspected the military parade. He also visited the Taj Mahal and other historic sites in Agra. The Prince returned to England via Ceylon and arrived back in London on March 31st.\n(1282 A.D.), a score of years after the Mongol sack of Baghdad; but of these recent events he maintains a discreet silence throughout his Dictionary, which deals exclusively with the notable personages of the past age.\n\nFor the details of the fall of Baghdad and the great siege by H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, we have to consult, in the main, the works of Persian historians; since Ibn-al-Ath\u012br closes his Chronicle with the year 628 A.H., and neither Abu-l-Faraj nor Abu-l-Fid\u0101 afford much information on this subject. Indeed of the Mongol siege in the seventh century A.H. we know far less than we do, thanks to \u1e6cabar\u012b, of the first siege in the time of the Caliph Am\u012bn in the second century A.H.\n\nThe Persian History called the \u1e6cabak\u0101t-i-N\u0101\u1e63ir\u012b, which was written shortly after 658 (1260 A.D.), is a contemporary authority for the times of H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, and this with the information found in the work of Rash\u012bd-ad-D\u012bn, also written in Persian, which was finished in 710 (1310 A.D.), provides a fairly clear account of the siege operations. After overrunning and devastating western Persia, the Mongol armies poured down the great Khur\u0101s\u0101n Road from \u1e24ulw\u0101n, the main body marching direct on East Baghdad. A considerable detachment, however, had been sent up-stream with orders to cross the Tigris at Takr\u012bt, thence to make a sweep round, and after capturing Anb\u0101r on the Euphrates, these troops were to approach West Baghdad by the line of the \u2018\u012as\u0101 Canal.\n\nThe Mongol forces were led by H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b, grandson of Jenghiz Kh\u0101n, who commanded the centre division in person, and he pitched his camp to the east of Baghdad, the siege beginning in the middle of Muharram of the year 656 (January, 1258). His main attack was directed\n\n---\n\n1 Another almost contemporary writer is Wass\u0101f, the historiographer of Gh\u0101z\u0101n the II-Kh\u0101n of Persia. He was born at Sh\u012br\u0101z in 1263 A.D.; five years, therefore, after the Mongol siege of Baghdad; and must have known personally many of those who had taken part in this famous event. I have gone through the pages of this work (edited in Persian with a German translation by Hammer-Purgstall in 1856) which are devoted to the times of H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b and the siege, but have been unable to glean a single fact not already mentioned by Rash\u012bd-ad-D\u012bn; the bombastic style in which Wass\u0101f writes being indeed but ill-adapted for conveying any precise topographical information.\nagainst \"the left of the city\"\u2014to one coming from Persia\u2014namely, the Burj 'Ajami (the Persian Bastion), and the Halbah Gate. The right wing of the Mongol army lay before \"the breadth of the city,\" that is to say on the north side, facing the Gate of the Market of the Sultan, called the B\u0101b-as-Sult\u0101n by Ibn Jubayr; and the left wing was encamped before the Kalw\u0101dh\u0101 Gate at the southern extremity of East Baghdad. The detachments that had previously been sent north across the river, after defeating the armies of the Caliph Musta'sim on the right bank of the Tigris, took up their positions in two attacks; one near the 'Adudi Hospital at the upper (older Main) Bridge of Boats; while the second had its siege camp below this to the southward, probably near the lower Bridge opposite the Palace of the Caliph, and outside the Quarter known as the Kurayyah.\n\nThe lower camp of the Mongols on the western bank is variously described as having been pitched at the place called D\u016bl\u0101b-i-Bak\u0101l (in the Persian history of Rashid-ad-D\u012bn), or at the Mabkalah (according to Abu-l-Faraj); the former name means \"the Water-wheel of the Vegetable-garden,\" and the latter \"the Kitchen-garden,\" both terms reminding us of the older D\u0101r-al-Battikh (the Vegetable Market), which stood, according to Ibn Serapion, in this part of West Baghdad. The Kal'ah or Citadel which is also mentioned by Rashid-ad-D\u012bn, when describing the attack on the west side, presumably has reference to what in the\n\n---\n\n1 Major Raverty has made some blunders in his very useful translation of the Tabakat-al-Nasiri (published in the Bibliotheca Indica, 1881) in the matter of place-names, some of which, to save further misunderstanding, it may be well to correct. Op. cit., p. 1240, Dajayl is several times put for the Dujayl Canal, and this does not mean \"branch\" as here stated, but is the diminutive form of Dujayl, and hence signifies \"the Little Tigris.\" It will be remembered that Kalw\u0101dh\u0101 is the outlying suburb or township below East Baghdad, which gave its name to the Southern Gate of the city called the B\u0101b Kalw\u0101dh\u0101. Now Kalw\u0101dh\u0101 in the Persian pronunciation becomes Kalw\u0101z\u0101 (with a s for the Arabic dh), but under no circumstances should the name be written as though consisting of two words \"Kul-w\u0101z\u012b,\" as given on p. 1243 op. cit., also a is the right vowel throughout. A similar remark, as regards the Persian pronunciation, applies to the 'Adudi Hospital, which name the countrymen of the Buyid Princes would, of course, pronounce 'Azudi; Major Raverty, however (a few lines below his Kul-w\u0101z\u012b), changes 'Adudi or 'Azudi into 'Usdi, which makes the name almost unrecognizable.\nthirteenth century A.D. still remained standing of the old fortifications of the Round City of Mans\u016br.\n\nThe siege operations, pushed to the uttermost by H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b from outside the city, were but too well seconded by treachery within the walls of Baghdad, for both Karkh and the Quarter round the Shrine of the Im\u0101m M\u016bs\u0101 in the K\u0101zimayn, were inhabited by Sh\u012b\u2018ahs, who, to prove their abhorrence of the Sunn\u012b Caliph, corresponded traitorously with the Mongol enemy. After a blockade of about fifty days, a great assault was ordered at the Persian Bastion near the \u1e24albah Gate, and East Baghdad having been taken by storm, the Caliph Musta\u2018sim was brought out prisoner with his family and lodged in the Mongol camp. Shortly afterwards H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b in person entered the city and took up his residence in what Rash\u012bd-ad-D\u012bn calls the Maym\u016bniyah (\"the Monkey-house\"), doubtless a designed corruption for the name of the Mam\u016bniyah Quarter, which lay on the side of East Baghdad nearest to what had been the headquarter camp of the Mongols.\n\nThe sack of Baghdad which followed lasted forty days, during which time a large proportion of the inhabitants were butchered in cold blood; while a conflagration which destroyed the Mosque of the Caliph, the Shrine of M\u016bs\u0101-al-K\u0101\u1e93im, and the Tombs of the Caliphs at Ru\u1e63\u1e6dah, besides most of the streets and private houses, completed the ruin of the city. The death of the Caliph Musta\u2018sim, and of his sons, followed close on these events\u2014the details of their \"Martyrdom\" are variously given in different authorities, who, however, agree as to the main facts\u2014and then the Mongol hordes passed on to further conquests and fresh plunder; H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b leaving orders that the Great Mosque of the Caliph and the Shrine of M\u016bs\u0101 in the K\u0101zimayn should be rebuilt.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 A full description of the fall of Baghdad, carefully put together from all available sources\u2014Arabic, Persian, and Turkish\u2014will be found in Sir H. Howorth's \"History of the Mongols,\" vol. iii, pp. 113 to 133. For the death of the Caliph Musta\u2018sim, the well-known account given by Marco Polo (see the translation of Sir Henry Yule, vol. i, p. 65), who was almost a contemporary, is probably true in the main facts, though the details may be fictitious; at any rate, his authority is as good as that of most of the Moslem writers.\n\nJ.B.A.S. 1899.\nThe state of ruin in which Baghdad was reduced by the Mongol sack is clearly indicated, half a century later, in the work known as the Mar\u0101sid, an Epitome of Y\u0101k\u016bt's Geographical Dictionary, which was composed about the year 1286 (1300 A.D.) by an anonymous author. This book gives a summary of the facts detailed in the more voluminous work; but, in addition, the epitomator, when tracing of places personally known to him, constantly supplies corrections correcting Y\u0101k\u016bt, and states how matters stood in his own day. Hence, though primarily only an epitome of a compilation, the Mar\u0101sid has for Baghdad and Mesopotamia the value of an authority at first hand. The author's description of Baghdad City is graphic and true. After referring to the ruin brought about by a long succession of plundering armies\u2014Persians, Turks, and Mongols\u2014all of which had in turn wasted the goods and lives of the former inhabitants, he concludes with the\n\n...\nIbn Jubayr as his model, and he cites long passages from the work of his predecessor; but unfortunately does not always state quite clearly whether what Ibn Jubayr had described in 580 (1184 A.D.) was what he, Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah, had still found existing in Baghdad at the date of his own sojourn there in the year 727 (1327 A.D.). This vagueness of statement militates against the value of his work from a topographical point of view. Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah, however, describes some buildings of a later date than Ibn Jubayr; the Mustansiriyah College, for example, indicating where this stood in Eastern Baghdad, and hence, since its ruins still exist, enabling us to add another fixed point for connecting modern Baghdad with the mediaeval city of the Caliphs. Further, Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah (unless, indeed, in this he is merely servilely copying his predecessor Ibn Jubayr) appears to have been the last authority who saw the three great Mosques of the older capital still standing, namely, the Mosque of Man\u1e63\u016br in West Baghdad, and the Rus\u0101fah Mosque on the eastern side, lying one mile distant from its neighbour the Mosque of the Salj\u016bk Sultan. At the present day these three buildings seem to have entirely disappeared, as also all vestiges of the \u2018Ad\u016bd\u012b Hospital, which in the fourteenth century A.D., though a complete ruin, was still standing on the right bank of the Tigris, at the place where the older Main Bridge crossed the river to Rus\u0101fah.\n\nThe last Moslem authority for Baghdad is the Persian historian and geographer Hamd-Allah, surnamed Mustawfi (the Treasurer), who was the contemporary of Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6dah, the Berber. He wrote an Universal History called the Tarikh-i-Gus\u012bdah (the Choice Chronicle) and a work on Geography called the Nuzhat-al-Kul\u016bb (the Heart\u2019s Delight), the later work having been completed in the year 740 (1339 A.D.). Hamd-Allah describes Baghdad, both east and west, as in his day surrounded by walls. The eastern\n\n---\n\n1 Ibn Bat\u016b\u1e6dah, ii, 107.\n2 The Persian text of the section on Baghdad has been printed by C. Sehefer in the Suppl\u00e9ment au Siasset Nameh, p. 146. (Paris, 1897.)\nThe seat of the Turkish Provincial Government was in the last century, as now, in the Eastern City, and the old wall which surrounds the town on the land side is pierced by four ancient gateways, one of which, called the B\u0101b-at-Talism (the Gate of the Talisman), as already stated, bears the inscription of the Caliph N\u0101\u1e63ir. The ruins of both the Mustan\u1e63ir\u012byah College and the Mosque exist, and not very far from this last stands the Shrine of \u2018Abd-al-K\u0101dir of Gil\u0101n, which dates back to the last days of the Caliphate.\n\nAbove the city, on the eastern Tigris bank, stands the Tomb of the Im\u0101m Abu \u1e24anifah in the village now known as Al-Mu\u2018azzam, and on the western bank, opposite this, Niebuhr especially mentions that the Sepulchre of the Im\u0101m Ibn Hanbal had formerly existed, but that shortly before his visit in 1750, this tomb had been carried away by the floods of the Tigris. On the western bank also, opposite but above the Mu\u2018azzam village of the east side, is the Shi\u2018ah Shrine of the K\u0101\u1e93imayn, some of the buildings of which may date from the times of the Caliphate; but of the Round City of Mans\u016br apparently nothing remains\u2014unless it be the Kufic inscription bearing the date 333 (945 A.D.), which both Commander Jones and Sir H. Rawlinson describe as existing in this quarter in the Convent (Takiyeh) of the Bekta\u015f Dervishes.\n\nWhat is now called the Old Town on the western bank occupies the site of the former Karkh suburb, as is proved by the tomb of Ma\u2018r\u016bf Karkhi, which was built outside the Ba\u1e63rah Gate of the City of Mans\u016br, and which still exists, standing at some distance outside the Western Gate of the Old Town, and this place has been a much venerated shrine since the date of his death in the year 200 (815 A.D.). Niebuhr mentions as situated in this same neighbourhood the tomb of a certain Bahl\u016bl D\u0101nah, whom he describes as having been a relative and boon-companion of the Caliph H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, the gravestone bearing for date the year 501 (1108 A.D.). This personage apparently is not mentioned by any Moslem authority, and H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, in point of\nfact, had been dead more than three centuries at the date inscribed on the tomb.\n\nIn regard to the so-called Tomb of Zubaydah, which now stands a little to the south of that of Ma'r\u016bf Karkh\u012b, the facts mentioned in the Chronicle of Ibn-al-Athir are wholly against the assumption that this was the place of her burial. The older authorities, who describe the neighbouring shrine of Ma'r\u016bf, make no allusion to any tomb near here of the celebrated wife of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd; further in the Chronicle just named, it is clearly stated that Zubaydah was buried in the Cemetery of the K\u0101zimayn, lying on the river some three miles to the north of the picturesque monument which apparently has for the last two centuries borne her name. Niebuhr, who describes the tomb as it stood in the last century, gives the text of the Arabic inscription which then adorned it. In this it is set forth that '\u0100yishah Kh\u0101num, daughter of the late Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 Pasha, and wife of \u1e24usayn Pasha, Governor of Baghdad, was buried here in Muharram of the year 1131 (November, 1718 A.D.), her grave having been made in the ancient sepulchre of the Lady Zubaydah, grand-daughter of the Abbasid Caliph Man\u1e63\u016br, and wife of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, the date of whose death is (quite correctly) given as of the year 216 (831 A.D.).\n\nTo this information Niebuhr adds the statement that the (so-called) tomb of Zubaydah had been restored some thirty years before he visited Baghdad, when the Turkish Kh\u0101num was buried here, but by whom the monument was originally built appears to have been then unknown. Sir H. Rawlinson, who lived for many years in Baghdad, writes that the tomb of Zubaydah was first erected in 827 A.D., corresponding with 212 A.H.; but this would be four years before the date of her death as recorded on the unimpeachable authority of \u1e6cabar\u012b, and Sir Henry gives no authority for his statement.\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. Niebuhr, \"Voyage en Arabie,\" vol. ii, p. 240. (Amsterdam, 1780.)\n2 Ibn-al-Athir, ix, 395.\n3 Cf. \u1e6cabar\u012b, iii, 1105.\n4 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th edition, article \"Baghdad.\"\nHe also, apparently, had no doubts as to the present monument being the resting-place of this Princess, so famous both in the Chronicles and \"The Thousand and One Nights\"; though this attribution, as already stated, is entirely negatived by the authority of Ibn-al-Athir. Indeed, so far as I know, the earliest mention of this building having been the tomb of the Lady Zubaydah, only dates from the year 1713 A.D., when Husayn Pasha buried his wife here, in what, it would appear, he was told had been the sepulchre of the famous Abbasid princess.\n\nIn conclusion, a few paragraphs may serve to explain how the attempt has been made, in the two plans here given, to lay down the limits of mediaeval Baghdad on the lines of the modern city. The landmarks are, of course, the few ancient vestiges that still remain to fix the sites of buildings mentioned during the times of the Caliphs; and taking the plan of the present walled city on the east bank of the Tigris, we have to work backwards to the Round City of Mans\u016br on the western bank, of which no trace now exists.\n\nIt will be seen that East Baghdad of the present day has four gates, and there appears to be no reason to doubt that these, with the town wall, are identical in position with what is described by Ibn Jubayr as existing in 1184 A.D.; further, the ruins of the Mustansiriyah College, and the ancient Minaret still mark the upper limit of the Palaces of the Caliphs, which, lying within an encircling\n\n---\n\n1 For illustrations representing the so-called tomb of Zubaydah, and the shrine of Ma\u1e6dr\u016bf Karkh\u012b, see Jones, \"Memoir,\" p. 311. It is possible that this modern tomb of Zubaydah may be the building described in the twelfth century A.D. as standing near the high road outside the old Ba\u1e63rah Gate (see Ibn Jubayr, 227; and Bat\u016btah, ii, 108). The tomb within this shrine then bore an inscription, stating that 'Awn and Mu'in were buried here, two of the descendants of the Caliph 'Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. In the fourteenth century A.D. this same shrine is described by Ibn Bat\u016btah as a beautiful building, within which was the gravestone lying under a spacious dome-shaped monument. It would seem not unlikely that in the course of the next three centuries, the inscription having become illegible, and all memory of these 'Alids long forgotten, popular tradition may have fixed on this tomb as that which had been built over the remains of the celebrated wife of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, more especially since her real sepulchre in the Ka\u1e63imayn probably did not survive the Mongol siege and the subsequent conflagration.\nto be almost identical in position with the more ancient Gate of the Tuesday Market, the lowest in the line of the older wall which had surrounded the three Northern Quarters of Mukharrim, Shamm\u0101siyah, and Rus\u0101fah. This older wall of the Northern Quarters of East Baghdad went from below the Lower Bridge inland to the Abraz Gate (which last we know from Y\u0101k\u016bt stood within the area of the modern city), and thence going up by the Khur\u0101s\u0101n and Barad\u0101n Gates, rejoined the river bank again at the Shamm\u0101siyah Gate, some distance above the shrine of Abu \u1e24anifah, nearly opposite the K\u0101\u1e93imayn. The line of this older wall can only be traced approximately by plotting in the various roads and gates mentioned, but its general course is clearly indicated by many incidental references, and near the Abraz Gate it must have overlapped the line of the later city wall.\n\nIn Western Baghdad a fixed point is the present shrine of Ma\u02bfr\u016bf Karkh\u012b, which we are told originally lay outside the Ba\u1e63rah Gate of the Round City; and the positions of the Ba\u1e63rah and K\u016bsfah Gates\u2014lying a mile apart one from the other, and opening on the high-roads going, respectively, south to K\u016bsfah, and down the Tigris bank\u2014are fixed within narrow limits by the Ma\u02bfr\u016bf shrine and the course of the Tigris. The present bridge of boats, which crosses the Tigris opposite the remains of the Mustansiriyyah College, is almost certainly identical in position with the bridge mentioned by Ibn Jubayr and Y\u0101k\u016bt as starting from the Ka\u1e63r \u02bf\u012as\u0101 Quarter, which was separated by the Lower Harbour (at the mouth of the \u02bf\u012as\u0101 Canal) from the Kurayy\u0101h Quarter. The positions of these two Quarters in regard to the Ba\u1e63rah Gate of the Round City is known; and the Kurayy\u0101h Quarter lay opposite the Ni\u1e93\u0101miyyah College in Eastern Baghdad, which stood near the Tigris bank between the Palaces of the Caliphs and the city wall at the Kalw\u0101dh\u0101 Gate, which last is now known as the Eastern Gate of modern Baghdad.\n\nFinally, the courses of the \u02bf\u012as\u0101 Canal, the \u1e62ar\u0101t, and the Trench of T\u0101hir, with their numerous branches, also\nthe site of the town of Mahawul, a league from Baghdad, of which apparently nothing now remains, are all fixed within certain limits by reference to an imaginary line drawn from the point where the Tigris Canal left the Euphrates below Ashur to the mouth of this canal, where its waters poured into the Tigris at the Lower Harbour immediately below the bridge and opposite the Mustansiriya College. And the course followed by the Tahirid Trench, the Tigris Canal, and the Shatt, with their connecting watercourses, have to be laid down so as to carry these round the boundary-lines of the City of Mansur, which, with its four agglomerate gates, lay between the Sarif and the Trench of Tilbury, the amount being taken of the network of canals described by Ibn Serapion, which also encircled the Round City to the south, west, and north, while the Tigris Canal formed its eastern limit beyond the gate of the Round Palace.\n\nSuch, in brief outline, is the method that has been followed in constructing the accompanying plans; the details of which are seen in the incidental mention by many authors of these various places; and that in the course of the same lines are fairly exact appears to be evident. It seems to go without saying, where various authors have given such full work into their right places, that the accompanying descriptions are correct as to details. But though the relative positions of the important points and buildings are accurately given, and the authority, the actual position of which was not easy to be sought for, may be considered when excavations shall have been made, to bring the vestiges of the ancient city of Baghdad, such as the ruins of the Round City and of the Rusafa Mosque, to light, even the great Mosque of Mansur may be assured from it. Some traces of these must surely exist, for they were built of bricks and tiles, and digging would almost certainly bring them to light.\nfixed points needed for the verification of the mediaeval plan. Further, since these three Mosques in particular would appear to have been still standing in the fourteenth century A.D., when Ibn Bat\u016b\u1e6dah visited Baghdad, some fragments of their walls and arches may still remain at the present day to reward the explorer if careful search were made among the houses of the modern city.\nART. XXII.\u2014Notes on Inscriptions from Udy\u0101na, presented by Major Deane. By M. A. Stein, Ph.D.\n\nFor some time back the attention of scholars interested in the history and antiquities of the North-West Frontier regions of India has been drawn towards the remarkable series of inscriptions \"in unknown characters\" which the zealous search of Major H. A. Deane, C.S.I., Political Officer, Swat, Dir and Chitral, has brought to light in the territory of the ancient Udy\u0101na.\n\nSince the discovery of the epigraphical finds already published by M. Senart and myself,\u00b9 Major Deane, at the cost of no small trouble, has succeeded in collecting a considerable number of new inscriptions of this kind, either in the original stones or in the form of ink-impressions obtained through native agents. In accordance with the practice previously followed, the former were deposited in the Lahore Museum, while the impressions were, through Major Deane's kindness, entrusted to me for publication. In order, however, to make representative original specimens accessible also to scholars resident in Europe, Major Deane decided to present some of the stones more recently collected to the Royal Asiatic Society. Major Deane, by this liberal gift, has given a fresh proof of his eager desire to further researches bearing on the antiquities of those interesting frontier-regions, with which he is so closely connected as a soldier-administrator, and for the archaeological exploration of which he has himself done so much. The permission of\n\n\u00b9 See M. E. Senart's Notes d'Epigraphie Indienne.\u2014V.

Stein, Notes on New Inscriptions discovered by Major Deane, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1898, I. pp. 1\u201319, with plates i.\u2013vii.\nthe Government of India having been obtained for this gift, I gladly undertook, at Major Deane's request, the task of selecting suitable specimens and accompanying them with the necessary explanations.\n\nIn offering these in the form of the present notes, I may be allowed to refer to my previous publication in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1898, in respect of all general questions bearing on the character and date of these puzzling inscriptions. No advance seems yet to have been made towards the decipherment of any of the scripts which are exhibited by these finds in such striking variety. Nor do the newly acquired materials appear as yet to offer any help in that direction.\n\nIn regard to the topographical distribution of the finds, too, the previous observations still appear to hold good. The newly collected inscriptions attach themselves closely, in respect of their characters, to the several local groups or types which M. Senart and myself have been able to distinguish among the earlier series. This is fully illustrated by the specimens presented to the Royal Asiatic Society. It will hence be convenient to describe them in the order of the groups to which they belong.\n\nNos. i.-iv. (numbered 95, 93, 94, 96 in Major Deane's list) are small stones, all coming from Daruizgai, close to the village of Spankharra which lies in the territory of the R\u0101nizai Clan, just beyond the northernmost point of the Hashnagar Tal\u016bsil, Peshawar District. They exhibit the same curiously twisted and scrawly lines which are characteristic for the inscriptions or rather sgraffitti that have previously come to light from the neighbourhood of Spankharra. Also in the small size and the irregular shape of the stones our Nos. i.-iv. resemble closely the previous specimens of the Spankharra group, as will easily be seen by a comparison of figs. 1-23 on plate I. of my above-quoted paper.\n\nTo the second group, that of Run\u0113r, may be attributed with great probability No. v (numbered 25 in Major Deane's list, and previously known to me from an impression).\nThe place at which this stone was originally found is unknown, as it was brought to Major Deane's agent by a wandering Talib. But each of its characters can be traced in otherwise accessible specimens of the Bun\u0113r group (compare figs. 24\u201336, 76\u201391 of plates accompanying Parts I and II, resp., of my paper in the J.A.S.B.). Hence I have little doubt that this small stone, too, was originally brought from some place in Bun\u0113r territory. Its peculiarity is the carefully raised and polished face on which the characters are incised. It suggests that the stone may have possibly been intended for a seal, a supposition with which the remarkably small size of the stone would well agree.\n\nNo. vi., which comes from Khudu Kh\u0113l territory, south of Mount Mah\u0101ban, shows the characters peculiar to the \"Mah\u0101ban\" type which is so largely represented among the previously published inscriptions. Though this stone is somewhat larger and more regular in shape than those hitherto noticed, we are confronted here, too, by the difficulty of determining which was the position intended for the inscription, i.e. what is to be considered as the top or bottom. The great majority of the inscriptions of the Mah\u0101ban group clearly shows the characters arranged in horizontal lines, though we have no certain clue as yet as to whether they are to be read from the right or left. In the case of our No. vi., too, an arrangement in four horizontal lines is unmistakeable. The lowest of these lines (taking the stone as shown in the plate) contains a smaller number of characters than the rest, and these more closely placed, evidently owing to want of space. From this we may perhaps conclude that the shortest line contains the last letters of the inscription, and that therefore the position assumed in the reproduction was the one originally intended.\n\nThe remaining three inscriptions come from the Upper Sw\u0101t Valley, and show in their characters a near affinity to the few inscriptions which in the above-quoted paper I distinguished as the fifth or Sw\u0101t group. This close agreement of the characters is particularly striking in the case of No. vii., which, according to Major Deane's note,\nwas \"found in an old ruin on a hill near Gogdarra in Upper Sw\u0101t.\" About one-half of the characters it exhibits can be made out also on the impressions of two rock-cut inscriptions from Odigr\u0101m, reproduced in figs. 52 and 53 of plate VII., J.A.S.B., 1898. We may lay the more stress on this recurrence of particular characters as the find-places are in close proximity. According to the Sketch Map of Upper Sw\u0101t, prepared on the basis of the Field Survey which was effected during the short reconnaissance into the Upper Sw\u0101t Valley in August, 1897, Gogdarra is a village near the left bank of the Sw\u0101t River, only about one mile below Odigr\u0101m, more correctly spelt Udegr\u0101m. The distance of Gogdarra from the Landak\u0113 spur, the nearest point of the Sw\u0101t Valley at present accessible and the site of a notable engagement during the rising of 1897, is about ten miles.\n\nThe Udegr\u0101m inscriptions are engraved on a rock, and their position, according to the impressions supplied to me, is that shown on my plate. This helps us in determining with some probability the position in which our No. vii. was intended to be read. For it is only when holding the stone in the position indicated by the reproduction that the identity of a number of characters with those of the Udegr\u0101m inscriptions becomes apparent.\n\nThe old ruin to which Major Deane's note refers as the place where the Goglarra stone was found, belongs in all probability to one of those ancient villages and towns which can be traced in so great a number along the hill slopes of the Sw\u0101t Valley. The ruins of these old sites consist mainly of fortified dwelling-places such as I have fully described in the case of similar sites examined by me in Bun\u0113r.\u00b9 When visiting the heights of the Landak\u0113 spur at the close of the year 1897, I could with my field-glasses make out a succession of such ruined sites along the slopes of the hills stretching up the left bank of the Sw\u0101t Valley towards Barik\u014d\u1e6d, Shangard\u0101r, and Udegr\u0101m.\n\n\u00b9 See Detailed Report of an Archaeological Tour with the Bun\u0113r Field Force, by M. A. Stein; Lahore, 1898, pp. 5 sqq. (Reprinted in Indian Antiquary, 1899, March-April.)\nThe most interesting piece of the present collection, and from a historical point of view as yet the most instructive of all of Major Deane's inscriptions in \"unknown characters,\" is the stone No. viii. It was brought to Major Deane early in the present year from Upper Sw\u0101t, but its exact find-spot could not be ascertained. Its obverse shows a miniature relievo representation of a column in the Gandh\u0101ra style, with a Corinthian capital, placed in a kind of niche. From the foliage of the capital rises the upper half of a small human figure, now much effaced. On the rough back of this small sculpture, which measures about 8 inches in height and 3\u00bd inches in breadth, a number of characters has been incised, some of which resemble closely those found in the Udegram and Gogdarra inscriptions (for the character curiously resembling the Arabic numeral 3, compare also fig. 54 on plate VII., J.A.S.B., 1898).\n\nJudging from a comparison of numerous similar pieces in the great collection of Gandh\u0101ra sculptures now in the Lahore Museum, I believe there can be little doubt that this small relievo fragment formed part of a panel adorning a small votive St\u016bpa. As one flank of the piece (on the proper left) shows a carefully smoothed surface, it seems probable that it occupied the corner in one of the courses forming the square base of the St\u016bpa. The dovetail on the top shows that there was probably a similar course above it. The back of the relievo is left perfectly rough and uneven, which proves conclusively that it was not originally intended to be exposed to view. It is, in fact, clear that the back of the relievo panel must have been attached to the structure of stone or plaster which formed the interior of the small St\u016bpa.\n\nFinding then characters cut into the rough surface of the back of this fragment, we are led a priori to conclude that this inscription or rather sgraffitto was made after the relievo had been destroyed or removed from its original position. The only other supposition would be that the inscription, if coeval with the relievo, was directly intended to be hidden from view. Such an assumption, however,\nis in itself very improbable, and a careful examination of the characters suffices to dispose of it. The stone on the back of the relievo has suffered considerably, and pieces both at its top and bottom have been chipped off. Yet none of the incised characters shows any trace of injury. This fact scarcely admits of any other explanation than that they were engraved at a later date when the fragment had already been reduced to the form in which we now see it.\n\nThe observation here indicated possesses considerable interest with reference to the question of the date and origin of these puzzling inscriptions. The chronology of the so-called Graeco-Buddhist art represented in the sculptures of the Gandh\u0101ra and Udy\u0101na monasteries is still obscure in many respects. But there are strong grounds for the now generally accepted opinion which looks upon the first four centuries of our era as the period when the sculptural art of Gandh\u0101ra developed and flourished.1 Hitherto we have been without a single piece of definite evidence as to the date of any of Major Deane's inscriptions \"in unknown characters.\" The small stone we have now examined supplies such evidence at least in one direction. It is impossible for us to judge how long after the original date of the relievo the latter was destroyed and the characters now seen engraved on its reverse. But we can safely assert now that this inscription itself cannot be older than the period to which the sculpture belongs, and that it probably dates considerably later.\n\nWe might draw the lower chronological limit somewhat more closely if the indication furnished by a detail feature of the little sculpture could be considered quite certain. I mean the small human figure rising from amidst the foliage of the capital. This decorative motive, which is frequent enough in the capitals of the Gandh\u0101ra style, was in all probability, like the great majority of the formal elements of the style, borrowed from the West. There, according to Mr. Fergusson's statement, it makes its first\n\n1 Compare A. Gr\u00fcnwedel, Buddhistische Kunst in Indien, 1893, p. 79.\nprominent appearance in late Roman art (Baths of Caracalla, A.D. 312\u2013330). If this observation is correct, it seems unlikely that this particular ornament could have found its way into Gandh\u0101ra architecture much before the fourth century of our era. But I am unable at present to verify Mr. Fergusson's opinion or to follow up this interesting question with the help of fresh materials.\n\nChronological evidence of some kind is furnished also by the last piece of the present collection, No. ix. The note with which it was forwarded to me in August, 1898, describes the origin of this stone as follows: \"Inscribed stone said to have been found in an old fort which stands on a hill called Kahun about 3 miles to the south of the village of Gabrial in Kandia in Upper Kohistan of Swat. This inscription is said to have been found originally 3 years ago, by a Zamindar of Gabrial who made it over to one Mulla Rajab Ali. The Mulla made it over to a Talib named Muhibulla who gave it to Abul\" (Major Deane's agent).\n\nThe inscription is engraved on the carefully polished flat surface of a black marble-like stone, which measures on its top about 12 inches by 6 inches. The edge along one long and one short side shows a diaper ornament, which is reproduced also on three sides of the thickness of the stone (about 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches). The smooth flat bottom of the stone, without ornament or writing, shows a square hole evidently intended for the insertion of a clamp.\n\nSome of the characters of the inscription resemble those found on the stones from the Sw\u0101t Valley above discussed, while others reappear on the curious inscribed stones which were obtained from ruined sites near Zangi Kh\u0101n Banda and Kharapa in Bun\u0113r, and are reproduced in figs. 49\u201351 of plate VII., J.A.S.B. With the last-named inscriptions our No. ix. shares a striking irregularity in the position of the letters which seems scarcely compatible with the intention of a lineal arrangement.\n\n1 Compare Fergusson, History of Indian Architecture, p. 178.\nA glance at the stone or its reproduction shows that the carved diaper ornament which encloses the inscribed surface on two sides, could not possibly be of a later date than the inscription itself. For though the characters are placed close enough to this ornamented edge, yet they are nowhere cut or otherwise effaced by the latter. The ornament must, therefore, be either anterior to, or coeval with, the inscription. On this account the style and design of this ornament deserves our attention.\n\nThe ornament consists of a rather coarsely executed diaper, which shows four-leaved flowers in diagonally placed squares, the triangular spaces left outside the squares being filled up with halved flowers of the same shape. This design bears the closest resemblance to a diaper frequently found in the ornamental carving of Gandh\u0101ra sculptures. It is enough to compare the decoration of our stone with the diaper ornament of a sculptured fragment excavated in 1895 from the site of an ancient Vih\u0101ra at Dargai (below Malakand), and now in the Lahore Museum (see fig. x), in order to realize the relatively late date of the former. Here, too, it is impossible to fix the upper limit of the possible range of dates. But judging from the general appearance of the design and its coarse execution, I can see no reason why the stone with its inscription might not belong to one of the centuries immediately preceding the Muhammadan conquest.\n\nThe indications furnished by the two inscriptions last discussed leave still a wide chronological margin. They are nevertheless of special value when considered with reference to the suggestion\u2014first made by Messrs. L\u00e9vi and Chavannes and discussed in my former Notes\u2014as to the possible connection between these inscriptions \"in unknown characters\" and the rule of a Turkish dynasty in Udy\u0101na.\u00b9\n\nWe have the testimony of the Chinese pilgrim Ou-k'ong\n\n\u00b9 See J.A.S.B., 1898, pp. 13 sqq.; L\u2019Itin\u00e9raire d\u2019Ou-k\u2019ong, traduit et annot\u00e9 par MM. Sylvain L\u00e9vi et \u00c9d. Chavannes, Journal asiatique, 1895, pp. 383 sq.\nand of the T'ang Annals for the fact that Udy\u0101na and Gandh\u0101ra were subject during the eighth century of our era to a dynasty of Turkish nationality and language. From an important notice of Alb\u00e9r\u016bni, which I have fully discussed elsewhere, we must conclude that these rulers belonged to the dynasty of the \"Turkish Sh\u0101hiyas of K\u0101bul\" which continued to hold those territories down to the end of the ninth century. It is an acknowledged fact that none of the scripts in Major Deane's puzzling epigraphical finds are related to any known Indian systems of writing. On the other hand, it appears possible that they are connected in some way with alphabets used about the period indicated by Turkish tribes in Central Asia.\n\nI regret that the hope I had expressed in my first Notes on Major Deane's inscriptions for a closer examination of these relations by a competent Turkish scholar has not yet been realized. Until this is done the above suggestion as to the origin of the inscriptions \"in unknown characters\" must be considered a mere conjecture. It is, however, in the meantime reassuring to find that the chronological evidence gathered from Major Deane's latest discoveries is in no way opposed to that conjectural dating.\n\n1 See my note \"On the history of the S\u0101his of K\u0101bul\" in Festgruss an Rudolf von Roth, 1893, pp. 200 sqq.; and Note J (\"The S\u0101hi of Udabh\u0101nda\") in my forthcoming translation of Kalha\u1e47a's R\u0101jatarang\u012b\u1e47i, vol. ii, pp. 386 sqq.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. \"Ospreys.\"\n\n102, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea,\nLondon, S.W.\n\nSir,\u2014In our Journal for July, 1899, p. 493, Mr. F. W. Thomas translates \"k\u016b\u1e6d\u0101jvara 'fever caused by hooting of ospreys.'\" I venture to suggest that the bird referred to may not be the \"osprey\" of English naturalists (Pandion haliaetus). This, although not at all a dumb bird, is perhaps the least noisy of all birds of prey, especially in India, where it seldom breeds, and therefore has not often to address a mate or young.\n\nI suppose that if you polled India to-morrow you would not find an hundred men who could describe the call of the osprey in writing, in any language.\n\nPerhaps there is some such joke in the word as in the phrase \"horns of a hare,\" which seems to occur all over India. But more probably it is to be classed with our own term \"Brain-fever Bird\" applied to a certain black cuckoo; and the bird referred to was one of the fishing-eagles (Haliaetus), which are very familiar and vociferous in some places, and will even build, year after year, in towns and villages. It may, indeed, have been their poor relation, the red-and-white 'Brahmani Kite' (Haliastur), which is almost as noisy, more abundant, even bolder in habit, and a known object of other queer beliefs.\n\nW. F. Sinclair.\n2. Ospreys.\n\nSir,\u2014I must confess my inability to throw light upon Mr. Sinclair's interesting suggestion.\n\nThe cry of the kurara is often referred to in Sanskrit poetry (v. B\u00f6htlingk & Roth's Lexicon, s.v.), being compared to the wailing of women, etc. In the passage, Har\u1e63a-Carita, p. 53, l. 1, the \u00e7opahara fishes are excited by the cry, which, as the commentator says, sant\u0101pak\u0101ritv\u0101d, \"in consequence of its heat-(or pain)-causing nature,\" is described as producing jvara or 'fever.' But I do not suppose that k\u016b\u1e6dajvara was the name of a commonly recognized disease.\n\nKurara is usually rendered by 'osprey' or 'sea-eagle,' in German 'Meeradler,' and the bird is described in the above passage as occupying the arjuna-trees by the river banks. Whether the translation is zoologically accurate, I am not at all competent to decide.\n\nF. W. Thomas.\n\n3. Some Arabic Manuscripts.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014With your permission I should like to continue and conclude my notice of the Persian and Arabic MSS. in my possession. I have already dealt with the Persian MSS., and with those of the Arabic that fall under the head of Poetry or Commentaries thereon. I will now mention some of the more noteworthy MSS. in the departments of Theology, History and Biography, Medicine, Grammar, and Belles Lettres.\n\nA.

This Kor'\u0101n is virtually the same as that so particularly described by De Sacy in Notices et Extraits, vol. ix, pp. 76\u2013102. The essential identity of the two MSS. is evident even in the Preface, where the\nsame things are said in a different order, though less copiously in my MS. Both represent the same edition of the Kor'\u0101n and have the same system of exhibiting the diversities of the seven Readers.

The Bahjatu'l Mardiy\u0101 is mentioned by \u1e24\u0101ji Khalifa (vol. i, pp. 408, 409). Fl\u00fcgel in his translation of the passage makes it appear that Ibn 'Aqil is the author of the Bahjat, whereas it is in fact the work of Suy\u016b\u1e6d\u012b (see Brit. Mus. Cat., p. 237).

OBITUARY NOTICE.\n\nPeter Peterson.\n\nWhile the sense of the loss which we sustained by B\u00fchler's death is still keen, we have to mourn for the loss of yet another member of that band of Sanskrit scholars\u2014the 'Bombay School' one may call them\u2014who have led and directed the most remarkable and fruitful revival of Sanskrit learning in India of our time. Professor Peterson, who died from heart-disease after a very short illness on the 28th of August, was born in 1847 in the Shetland Isles. He was educated at the High School, Edinburgh, and graduated both at Edinburgh and Oxford (Balliol College). His Sanskrit studies began at Edinburgh under Professor Aufrecht, and were continued at Oxford, where he won the Boden Scholarship, under Professors Monier Williams and Max M\u00fcller. In 1873 he went to Bombay as Professor of Sanskrit at the Elphinstone College, and continued to hold this appointment for the rest of his life.\n\nPeterson had a wonderful power of quickly grasping the main points of a subject and of seeing its true inwardness. The possession of this faculty, combined with his never-failing tact and good-humour, especially qualified him to conduct the search for Sanskrit MSS., a work which, thanks to the liberality of the Bombay Government, has in the Bombay Circle been prosecuted with such signal benefit to Sanskrit learning. His four masterly Reports will, no doubt, be regarded by scholars generally as his greatest work. They show, what is most essential in dealing with large and heterogeneous collections of documents, an unerring power of discriminating between the more important and the less important, and are, in every way, models of what reports of the kind should be.\n\nAs an editor of Sanskrit texts\u2014all contributed to the Bombay Sanskrit Series, with the exception of the Ny\u0101yabindu\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, which was printed in the Bibliotheca\nIndica \u2014 Peterson showed much the same characteristics of mind. There can surely, for instance, be no better introduction to the K\u0101vy\u0101 literature than his edition of K\u0101dambar\u012b, with its sympathetic preface and its appreciative notes. From these the student will learn how much of the beautiful is common to the poetry of the East and of the West, in spite of the different and sometimes apparently incongruous forms in which it is expressed. In fact, one of Peterson's favourite ideas was that, in spite of difference of form, the spirit of these two classes of literature was much the same. A good instance of this is to be seen in his preface to the edition of Vallabhadeva's Subh\u0101\u1e63it\u0101vali, by Pandit Durg\u0101pras\u0101da and himself, where he gallantly defends Sanskrit romantic poetry from the too sweeping charges of barrenness and futility brought against it by a certain learned Sanskrit scholar. Indeed, no one can have known Peterson, or have studied his introductions to K\u0101dambar\u012b or the Subh\u0101\u1e63it\u0101vali, without recognizing that, in many respects, his temperament was poetic rather than scholastic. His great aim was to teach his readers how to appreciate and enjoy the beauties which he certainly appreciated and enjoyed himself: he was not so anxious, as an interpreter, to refrain from cutting Gordian knots occasionally.\n\nAmong Peterson's other works may be mentioned editions of the Hitopade\u015ba, of the Pad\u0101lhati of \u015a\u0101r\u1e45gadhara, a Selection of Hymns from the Rig Veda with Translation, and the first two parts of a Handbook to the Study of the Rig Veda.\n\nHe contributed frequently to the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and was President of that Society at the time of his death. To our Journal he contributed, in 1891 (p. 311), a valuable article on Panini, Poet and Grammarian: with some remarks on the Age of Classical Sanskrit Poetry, in which he upheld the view, supported also by Hindu tradition, that the great grammarian and the author of certain verses, quoted in the Subh\u0101\u1e63it\u0101vali of Vallabhadeva, the Pad\u0101lhati of \u015a\u0101r\u1e45gadhara and elsewhere, were one and the same person, and, following the lead given by B\u00fchler in his then recent paper on Die\nIndischen Inschriften und das Alter der Indischen Kunstpoesie, contended for a much greater antiquity for Sanskrit poetry of the fixed classical form than scholars had been generally inclined to allow.\n\nAs a public speaker and as a writer, Peterson was master of a most beautiful English style. He several times acted as Professor of English at Elphinstone College, and as examiner in English for the Bombay University. For the benefit of native students, he compiled a volume of model essays, and published editions, with notes, of Shakespeare's \"Merchant of Venice\" and the fourth book of Palgrave's \"Golden Treasury.\" He frequently wrote for the Press\u2014chiefly for the Times of India\u2014and seemed to handle all sorts of subjects, political and otherwise, with the same facility and felicity.\n\nAll who were privileged to know him with some degree of intimacy will very sadly miss not only the cultured and refined scholar but also the genial and warm-hearted friend.\n\nE. J. Rapson.\n\nOctober 2, 1899.\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\n\nGOLD MEDAL.\n\nAs our members are aware, Mr. Wollaston is issuing a third appeal for subscriptions towards the establishment on a permanent basis of the Fund for the Society's Gold Medal. The following list shows the result thus far. For purpose of reference the results of the two former appeals are also here reprinted.\n\nIt will be seen that up to the end of September the result of the third appeal has been the very satisfactory total of \u00a3130 3s. 0d. The balance now required to complete the Endowment Fund is therefore about \u00a3100. It is hoped that this amount will be forthcoming during the next few months, so that on the presentation of the Medal in the summer of 1900 it may be announced that the entire sum has been raised.\n\n[F.R.A.]\n## FIRST LIST OF SUBSCRIPTIONS.\n\n| Name                                      | \u00a3  | s. | d. |\n|-------------------------------------------|----|----|----|\n| Mr. F.

PROFESSOR J. ESTLIN CARPENTER.\nROBERT CHALMERS, Esq.\n\nManaging Chairman\u2014T. W. RHYS DAVIDS, 22, Albemarle Street, London, W.\n(With power to add workers to their number.)\n\nHon.

Gooneratne, Esq., Atapattu Mudaliyar, Galle.\n\nThis Society has been started in order to render accessible to students the rich stores of the earliest Buddhist literature now lying unedited and practically unused in the various MSS. scattered throughout the University and other Public Libraries of Europe.\n\nThe historical importance of these Texts can scarcely be exaggerated, either in respect of their value for the history of folk-lore, or of religion, or of language. It is already certain that they were all put into their present form within a very limited period, probably extending to less than a century and a half (about B.C. 400\u2013250). For that period they have preserved for us a record, quite uncontaminated by filtration through any European mind, of the every-day beliefs and customs of a people nearly related to ourselves, just as they were passing through the first stages of civilization. They are our best authorities for the early history of that interesting system of religion so nearly allied to some of the latest speculations among ourselves, and which has influenced so powerfully, and for so long a time, so great a portion of the human race\u2014the system of religion which we now call Buddhism. The sacred books of the early Buddhists have preserved to us the sole record of the only religious\nmovement in the world's history which bears any close resemblance to early Christianity. In the history of speech they contain unimpeachable evidence of a stage in language midway between the Vedic Sanskrit and the various modern forms of speech in India. In the history of Indian literature there is nothing older than these works, excepting only the Vedic writings; and all the later classical Sanskrit literature has been profoundly influenced by the intellectual struggle of which they afford the only direct evidence. It is not, therefore, too much to say that the publication of this unique literature will be no less important for the study of history\u2014whether anthropological, philological, literary, or religious\u2014than the publication of the Vedas has already been.\n\nThe whole will occupy about nine or ten thousand pages 8vo. Of these 7,200 pages have already appeared. The accession of about fifty new members would make it possible to issue 1,000 pages every year.\n\nThe Subscription to the Society is only One Guinea a year, or Five Guineas for six years, payable in advance. Each subscriber receives, post free, the publications of the Society, which cost a good deal more than a guinea to produce.\n\nIt is hoped that persons who are desirous to aid the publication of these important historical texts, but who do not themselves read P\u0101li, will give Donations to be spread if necessary over a term of years. Nearly \u00a3400 has already been thus given to the Society by public-spirited friends of historical research.\n\n* * * Subscriptions for 1899 are due, and it is earnestly requested that subscribers will send in their payments without putting the Chairman to the expense and trouble of personally asking for them. All who can conveniently do so should send the Five Guineas for six years, to their own benefit and that of the Society also.\n\nThe Society keeps no books, and its publications cannot in any case be sent to subscribers who have not already paid their subscriptions for the year.\n\nCheques and Post Office Orders should be made payable to the \"P\u0101li Text Society.\" (Address: 22, Albemarle Street, London, W.)\nLIST OF THE MEMBERS\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nOF\n\nGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND:\n\nFOUNDED, March, 1823.\n\nCORRECTED TO 1st JANUARY, 1899.\n\n22, ALBEMARLE STREET,\nLONDON.\nPRESIDENT:\n1896 THE RIGHT HON.
