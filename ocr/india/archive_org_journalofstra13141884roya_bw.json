But what we know on this subject amounts to very little and is little more than what travellers have said of most wild tribes. The muscular strength of the Minopies is much greater than would be supposed from their short stature and rounded limbs. Like the \u00c6tes, they are remarkable for their extreme agility and the acuteness of their senses. Both\nparticulars gathered by a few travellers, which unfortunately come to very little.\n\nOf all the languages spoken by Negritos the most interesting to study would unquestionably be that of the Mincopies. Owing to the almost complete isolation in which these islanders have lived, especially in the Great Andaman group, (1) their dialects can only have been altered through natural evolution and independently of foreign influence. This language goes back certainly to remote antiquity and has probably preceded those now spoken in Malacca, Siam and in India itself. The study of it would consequently be of the greatest interest, as well from an ethnological as from a linguistical point of view.\n\nMr. E. H. Man seems to have understood it so. Before him, Symes, Colebrooke, R\u00f6epstorff, Tickel, &c., had confined themselves to gathering short vocabularies. (2) Brought into daily communication with the natives, in the course of his official duties, Mr. Man learned their languages. He translated in one of them the Lord's Prayer, which was published with a commentary\n\nraces are able to bear long fasting and also to consume at one meal a prodigious quantity of food. The Mincopies, who alone seem to have been studied at all from a pathological point of view, suffer mostly from diseases contracted from the habit, to which I shall refer hereafter, of clothing themselves, so to speak, with mud. Pulmonary consumption did not exist in the Andamans, but a few natives who came to European settlements were very soon afflicted with it. This would tend to confirm what I have repeatedly said, namely that we ourselves have imported the disease into various parts of the world where it was unknown before. (Les Polyn\u00e9siens et leurs Migrations et Journal des Savants, 1873.) M. Montano found, in one single Manthra family, two individuals afflicted one with the rickets, the other with epilepsy. (Quelques jours chez les indig\u00e8nes de la province de Malacca; Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I, p. 46.) This he appears to consider as a general rule and what he saw seemed to him to show how a race dies out. But the groups seen by M. Montano must be the exception. Logan, at all events, mentions nothing of the kind and appears, on the contrary, to assign to these populations a vitality capable of resisting the unfavourable conditions to which conquest has subjected them. (The Binua of Johore; The Journal of the Indian Archipelago, Vol. I, passim).\n\n(1) In my first \u00c9tude sur les Mincopies et la Race N\u00e9grito en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, I have mentioned the fact that signs of cross-breeding have been found in Little Andaman, south of the other islands. (Revue d'Anthropologie, Vol. I, p. 213.)\n\n(2) I have borrowed from these various writers some of the examples which seemed most suited to show clearly the variety of Mincopie dialects, first pointed to by Mr. Francis Day. (\u00c9tude sur les Mincopies, p. 194.)\nand notes added by Lieutenant R. C. Temple. Colonel Lane Fox, in two different papers, has given this translation, and summed up, though rather too briefly, the general conclusions of the authors. Thinking that it may be useful to readers, engaged in the study of languages, I transcribe hereunder the document which was the starting point of this investigation.\n\nThe study of the vocabularies to which I have just called attention had led Latham to admit of a certain connection between the Mincopie and Burmese languages. M. Pruner-Bey has pointed out a few common traits in the Mincopie and New Caledonian dialects. Hyde Clarke has fancied that he could discover in the Andamanese language affinities with those of several races of Asia, Africa and the two Americas. Messrs. Man and Temple begin by stating that the nine tribes which figure on the map prepared by one of these authors, have each a private language.\n\n---\n\n(1) The Lord's Prayer translated into B\u00f3jingjida by E.

H. Man, Esq., (Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. VII, p. 105.) The Lord's Prayer was translated into the language spoken by the tribe inhabiting the southern island of Great Andaman, where Fort Blair, the English Settlement, is situated.\n\"native of North Andaman is as utterly unable to make himself understood by a native of South Andaman, as an English peasant would be by a Russian.\" It is not, therefore, a question of simple dialects, but in reality of distinct languages. Yet these languages have a common origin and structure; they are all agglutinative. Should they have any affinities with others, which Messrs. Man and Temple consider as doubtful, it might be with the languages of Australia or of the Dravidian and Seythian groups, which they resemble in a few peculiarities, such as the use of post-positions instead of prepositions; the use of two forms\u2014one inclusive, the other exclusive\u2014for the first person of the plural, and, in general, in the agglutinative structure of words. Reading over these few sentences one is naturally reminded of the connection already noted by philologists among others by our eminent colleague, Mr. Maury, as existing between the Dravidian and Australian languages. (1) To these Messrs. Man and Temple add a third philological group which has probably preceded the two others. Everything in fact tends more and more to prove that the Negrito race, of which the Mincopies are the purest representatives, is the fundamental negro element of all or very nearly all the Dravidian tribes and of those who, though not speaking a language classified under that name, resemble them in physical characteristics. (2) If this is really the case, are we not entitled to believe that the substratum of this linguistic family will be found in the Mincopie languages? At all events, it is an interesting problem to solve, and we heartily wish that Messrs. Man and Temple may pursue researches which have already led them to such curious results.\n\nThough scattered from the Andaman Islands to the Philippines, the Negrito tribes have retained, in a remarkable manner, all their exterior and osteological characteristics. It is otherwise with re-\n\n(1) La Terre et l'Homme, 3me \u00e9dition, p. 504.) M. Maury is moreover inclined to connect these two groups of languages with the Medo-Seythian, which was probably spoken, he says, by the native tribes of Media and Susiana.\n\n(2) I have dwelt on this question in a paper in the Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I.\ngard to language. This has in some instances, completely disappeared, through contact with superior populations, even where Negrito groups, numerically strong and enjoying a certain independence, have preserved a comparative purity of blood.\n\nThis fact had been observed in the Philippines, from the earliest period of the Spanish occupation. Even in the island named after them, these diminutive negroes spoke Bisaya, one of the local Malay dialects, (1) to which however they added a great number of foreign words. It seems to me probable that these latter were so many surviving witnesses of the primitive language.\n\nStill more must this have been the case in Luzon. The evidence given on this point by De la Fuente, (2) has lately been fully confirmed by the researches of Dr. Montano, who has kindly placed his unpublished notes at my disposal with a liberality for which I am happy to be able to thank him here. This traveller, who speaks Malay fluently and is acquainted with several of its dialects, was able to detect, in the Aeta language, not only grammatical forms, but even a vocabulary, almost exclusively Tagalog. One by one, he verified one hundred and four words collected by Mr. Meyer in the dialect of the Mariveles. He noted down those which seemed to be foreign to the Malay languages and could find but seventeen. He is still unable to speak decidedly about some of these. (3)\n\n(1) \"La lingua dell'Isola detta de' Negri e la Bissaya stessa col miscuglio di moltissime parole forestiere.\" (L'Abb\u00e9 Torres, quoted by Prichard, Researches into the Physical History of Mankind, Vol. V, p. 221.)\n\n(2) Quoted by Prichard, loc. cit.\n\n(3) M. Montano found moreover in the same vocabulary, translated into the Negrito dialect of Zambales, thirteen words which are not Malay. He also obtained, not without some trouble, from an Aeta, the following verse of a song:\n\nMakaalis ako ina,\nI am going (oh my) friend\nmakpaka ba't, ka ina\nBe very prudent thou, friend\nTu! ma papuka sayou, ako ina,\nAh! I am going very far my friend,\nInto ka man a bibing ianmo.\nwhile you stop in dwelling yours.\nHanag banuan dolipatan mo.\nNever (your) village will be forgotten (by) me.\nM. Montano was unable to procure equally accurate information with regard to the language of the Mamanuas, or Negritos of Mindanao. But these people could make themselves understood by his guides who spoke to them a kind of corrupted or rather simplified Bisaya. (1) There also, no doubt, the primitive language has more or less died out.\n\nHas it been the same in the Malay Peninsula? M. Montano, does not think he can yet answer the question. He easily understood his Manthra (2) guide, when the latter spoke Malay to him; but he could catch but very few words when the same individual conversed with his wild countrymen. He is satisfied that the Manthras have a peculiar accent which may arise from various causes. Father Pouget, who has lived for a long time in Malacca and visited all the inland tribes, told M. Montano that these wild people had no special language or dialect of their own, and that they spoke a mixture of corrupted Malay and Siamese. However, in his curious work on the Binuas of Johore, (3) Logan regards it as certain that these people, though evidently more freely crossed with Malay blood than the Manthras, have had, in former times, a language of their own; and he brings forward numerous arguments in support of his opinion. (4) In the peculiar language, which they speak when searching for camphor trees (5) amid their forests, the same author has detected a certain number of words foreign to Malay. I have compared several of these with words in two\n\n---\n\nThe Negritos of the Albay province (South-east of Luzon) speak Bicol fluently. But they are crossed with Malays. The Bisaya Tagalog, Bicol, Pampango, etc., are but Malay dialects more or less considerably modified. (Montano.)\n\n(1) M. Montano says: \"a kind of Pidjin Bisaya.\"\n(2) The Manthras are half-breeds of the neighbourhood of Kesang, near Malacca, in the Malay Peninsula.\n(3) The most southerly region of the Malay Peninsula.\n(4) The Orang Binua of Johore. (Journal Indian Archipelago, I, p. 289.)\n(5) This language is called bassa kapor (camphor language). Logan found it employed and always the same, by the tribes who search for camphor. These savages are persuaded that it would be impossible to discover camphor trees if any other idiom but the bassa-kapor were spoken while search is being made for these trees. (Logan, loc. cit., p. 263.) M. Montano also mentions this language in his notes and spells it \"bahasa-kapour,\"\nSiamese and Laosian vocabularies published by Latham (1) and could not trace any resemblance. Nor could I find any on comparing these again with M. de la Croix's vocabulary of the Perak Saka\u00efs. (2) M. de la Croix only finds twelve Malay words out of the ninety which he gives. The Russian traveller Miklucho-Maclay had previously gathered, among the wild tribes of Johore and further inland, one hundred and seventy words, (3) which several Malays, on being consulted, declared were perfectly unknown to them. Lastly Mr. de Castelnau had also arrived independently at analogous conclusions. (4) From this aggregate of facts, it seems to me to result that the original Negritos of the Malay Peninsula must have had a language of their own, which has been almost completely forgotten by a portion of their descendants and a little less so perhaps by others, because they are all more or less crossed with Malays, no doubt with Siamese also, and probably with other ethnological elements still undetermined. Was this language connected in any way with that of the Min-copies? This is but an hypothesis, but the comparative proximity of the two races allows us at all events to put the question. Messrs. Man and Temple will perhaps one day tell us how much truth there may be in this conjecture. (5) They may also suc-\n\n---\n\n(1) Elements of Comparative Philology, p. 51.\n(2) Perak is situated about 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 North of Malacca towards the middle of the western coast of the Peninsula. We have no particulars as to the Negrito-Malay tribes which may exist further north.\n(3) Dialects of the Melanesian Tribes in the Malay Peninsula (Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 1, p. 38.) From Johore in the south of the Peninsula to Ligor in the south of Siam, the Russian traveller has ascertained the identity of language among tribes which are isolated and have no communication with each other. This result seems to have struck him with astonishment. There is, however, nothing in it which will not seem quite natural to any one who studies the history of Negritos taken as a whole.\n(4) Revue de Philologie, 1876. [I am indebted to M. Montano for this reference.]\n(5) It would, I think, be most interesting, with reference to this enquiry, to find out what language is spoken by the Negritos who have recently been discovered in the small archipelago of Tenasserim. Their comparative isolation might encourage a hope that their primitive language has been less altered than on the continent.\nceed in finding out whether there is anything solid in the singular affinities pointed to by Mr. Hyde Clarke, between the various Mincopie languages and certain African and American idioms. (1)\n\nLastly it would be of some interest to investigate whether the language of the Puttouas of the Amarkantak mountains, which is perfectly different from any Dravidian dialect of the neighbourhood, (2) would seem to be at all connected with those spoken in the Andaman Islands or Malay Peninsula.\n\nSocial State.\u2014The Mincopies depend exclusively for their existence on hunting and fishing and have no permanent homes. Living on the shores of a sea in which fish is remarkably abundant, within immediate reach of dense forests where pigs are very numerous, and honey and fruits plentiful, they have not felt the want of claiming from the soil a supplement of food, and this very state of comfort has, in itself, kept them down on the lowest rung of the social ladder. (3)\n\nMost travellers, who have visited the Philippine Islands, have spoken of the Aetas as having never got past this step, though placed in much less favourable conditions. La Gironni\u00e8re, (4) and Meyer are very positive on this point, (5) and M. Giglioli has unreservedly accepted what they say on the subject. (6) Rienzi himself, to whom we are indebted for information as to the more happy past of these people, represents them as living nowadays exclusively on wild fruits and the proceeds of fishing and hunting. (7)\n\n---\n\n(1) Note on the Languages of the Andamans (Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. IV, p. 467.)\n(2) Rousselet, Tableau des Races de l'Inde Centrale (Revue d'Anthropologie, Vol. II, p. 282.)\n(3) Mr. Francis Day informs us that a very small Mincopie tribe, stationed close to the British Settlements and receiving daily rations, bagged, in one year, 500 wild-boars, 150 turtles, 20 wild cats, 50 iguanas and 6 dugongs (Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1870, p. 153.)\n(4) Vingt Ann\u00e9es aux Philippines, p. 303.\n(5) Die Philippinen und ihre Bewohner, M.\n(6) Studi sulla Raza Nigrita (Archivio per l'Antropologia, Vol. V, p. 293, and Viaggio della Pirocorvetta Magenta, p. 245.)\n(7) Oc\u00e9anie, Vol. I, p. 301.\nBut it is evident that in the Philippines, this degraded social status is the consequence of the persecution which these Negritos have suffered at the hands of more powerful and vigorous races. No doubt also, the interestedly false statements made to travellers by the petty chiefs of Tagal villages, (1) have led to the admission, as general, of a state of things which is, perhaps, more or less exceptional. In reply to these exaggerations, I cannot do better than copy almost verbally M. Montano's own words:\n\n\"The Negritos of the Bataan province seemed to value fully the security afforded to them by the just and enlightened administration of the Governor, Don Estanislao Chaves. I have visited them in their own mountains......The house of the chief, very clean indeed, was situated on an eminence surrounded by other small hills. Several huts had been erected, every one of them in the centre of a clearing of a few acres planted with banana-trees, rice, sugar-cane and, above all, sweet potatoes........\n\nThe chief shouted, and immediately the shouts were repeated near and far. Before long the whole tribe had gathered round me ...... In the province of Albay, where the conditions of life must be similar to those which exist in Bataan, I have seen a considerable quantity of cacao that had been gathered by the Negritos inhabiting the islands of the bay.\"\n\nEven among the Mamanouas (2) of Mindanao, of whom the last survivors are constantly being hunted down by the ferocious Manobros, the French traveller saw on the eastern shore of Lake Ma\u00efnit, \"a timid tribe, very distrustful, who had nevertheless cleared a space in the jungle, erected huts, and planted banana-trees and sweet potatoes.\"\n\nThus, all that has been said about the indomitable roving instincts of A\u00ebtas is thoroughly inaccurate. If, in certain parts of the Archipelago, these diminutive negroes lead a wandering life, if they do not build huts or till the soil, the fault lies with those who persecute and victimize them. The method of cultivation just\n\n(1) MS. note of M. Montano.\n(2) Name given to Negritos in Mindanao. (Montano).\nmentioned, very primitive by the way, is to be seen among the half-breed Negritos of India and the Malay Peninsula. All of them seem to proceed in the same way. The Gond, like the Manthra, begins by felling the trees which he burns when half dried up. In the entanglement of trunks and branches, he then sows or plants rice, potatoes, &c. When the jungle shoots up again, he abandons his frail and leaf-covered hut and proceeds elsewhere to begin over again. A dog, a few fowls and pigs live as best they can in these primitive clearings. What they can get by fishing and hunting, together with edible roots and jungle fruits, seem to form the principal resources of these people. (1)\n\nSuch is the present state of things. But have not these tribes, now half-nomad and scattered, known better days and enjoyed a more perfect social organization? It is not easy to give a general answer to this question.\n\nAs far as regards the Mincopies, nothing indicates that they ever rose above what we know them to be now-a-days. Having, so to speak, under their hand, all that can satisfy the simple wants of a wild man, and without intercourse with foreigners, they have received nothing that could awaken new aspirations in them, and their intellectual activity has been applied solely to multiplying or improving the implements required by their mode of life. We shall see further on that they have, in that line, evinced real initiative power.\n\nIt is more than probable that in the Philippines, the Aetas were once in a more advanced stage. Rienzi, whose summary of the traditions of these people is unfortunately rather confused, represents them as having in by-gone days occupied the whole of Luzon and having for a long while resisted the Tagal invasions. (2) They had, in those times, a form of government. An assembly of chiefs and elders superintended the execution of the laws. (3) It is difficult to admit that, at that period, cultivation of the soil was not\n\n(1) Notes (unpublished) of M. Montano; Rousselet, loc. cit. p. 276; Logan, loc. cit. p. 255; etc.\n(2) Oc\u00e9anie, Vol. I, p. 301.\n(3) This is precisely what is still the custom among the Bhils, half-bred Negritos. (Rousselet, loc. cit. p. 61).\npractised at least in the same degree as that described by M. Montano.\n\nWith still more reason must it have been the same with the more or less mixed tribes of Malacca. M. Montano informs us that the Manthras have still preserved a recollection of the days when their ancestors ruled over the whole country. At that time, they say, they had numerous records written on leaves. This fact implies in itself a social state of which M. Montano seems to have found traces in the very name of his guide. He was called, as his father, grandfather, and, no doubt, his ancestors had been, Panglima dalam, which the traveller translates as \"the lord who administers the Sultan's palace.\" (1) This descendant of some great dignitary is now but a simple coolie in a Chinese plantation. In the Malay Peninsula, as in India, conquest has destroyed States that were considerable and flourishing once upon a time, but of which even recollection has been lost, driving back to the jungles and mountains the races, more or less Negro\u00efd, which had founded them. There the race, like many other Dravidian (2) groups, has returned to a wild life. It has been broken up and divided into tribes and small communities, (3) and the hierarchy of chiefs, recorded by Logan as existing among the Bermun populations, is probably all that is left of its former social state. (4)\n\n(1) Montano. Quelques jours chez les indig\u00e8nes de la province de Malacca. (Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I, p. 48).\n\n(2) The Bhils among others; however, they still have permanent homes, well built houses grouped in villages. What may be considered as a supposition with regard to some of the Bermun tribes would seem to be well ascertained with respect to their brethren the Binuas. Logan informs us that the latter were in former times governed by kings, the origin of whom was supposed to be supernatural and whose descendants are still to be found. (Logan, loc. cit. p. 279).\n\n(3) Montano, loc. cit. p. 46.\n\n(4) In his Memoir on the Binuas of Johore, Logan gives particulars concerning five tribes to which all that I say here specially applies: they are the Uda\u00efs or Orang-Pagos, the Jakuns, the Saka\u00efs, the Mintiras or Manthras and the Besisis. These tribes inhabit the mountainous region of Gunong Bermun, one of the highest ranges in the Malay Peninsula. Among the Manthras, there exist head-men (Batin) whose jurisdiction extends over well defined districts. Each Batin has under him a Jinang, a Jukra or Jorokra, and an indefinite number of Panglimas and Ulubalungs. On the death of a\nAmong Negritos, everywhere the family seems to have survived the general decline of the race. A Sepoy deserter whose assertions have been too easily accepted by some writers, represented it as rather loosely constituted in the Andaman islands. Information gathered by Lieutenant St. John (1) and particularly by Mr. Day, (2) has corrected what was erroneous in these early reports. The Mincopies are monogamous. Marriage only takes place with the consent of the guardian of the maidens, who sanctions the union of the pair by joining their hands together. The duties of man and wife are reciprocal, and the parents evince the most tender affection for their offspring. (3) In the Philippine Islands, La Gironni\u00e8re ascertained analogous facts, even among the wretched and savage tribe which he visited. \"The Aetas,\" says he, \"are faithful in wedlock and have but one wife.\" When a young man has made his choice, he applies to the parents, who never refuse their consent, but send the girl into the forest where she hides herself before daybreak. The young man has to find her, and, if he does not succeed, has to relinquish all claim. (4) It is evident that the decision really depends on the young girl.\n\nM. Montano's notes confirm and complete the information given by La Gironni\u00e8re. He moreover acquaints us with the curious ceremony which ratifies wedlock among the Aetas of Luzon. The young couple climb up two flexible trees which an old man bends down towards each other. When the head of the bridegroom touches that of the young woman the marriage is pronounced legal and is followed by a big feast and war dances.\n\nI also borrow from the same traveller the following interesting particulars relating to the Negritos of Mindanao.\n\n\"Among the miserable Mamannas, those ancient owners of the\n\nBatin, his successor is chosen from among the sons of one of his sisters.

(Montano.)\nWe must acknowledge that there is a great discrepancy between this state of things, as described by M. Montano, and the information given by his predecessors. This is one more instance, to be added to many others, of the imprudence of limiting oneself to superficial observation when it is a question of forming an opinion of these backward and wild populations.\n\nIn spite of their intermixture with alien races, the Negritos of Malacca would, no doubt, if better known, exhibit similar social characteristics. M. Montano tells us that they never go to war, (1) that parents attend most tenderly on their offspring, and, if necessary, will, for their sake, deprive themselves of food. Logan informs us that, among the Manthras, adultery is punished with death, but not unless, as among the Mamanuas, the crime be proved by witnesses. The sentence is passed by the head chief (Batin) and carried out by the Panglima. The two culprits are laid down in the nearest stream and their heads are kept under water by the means of a fork. A man who is convinced of his wife's misconduct, but who has no actual proof of it, can leave her on condition of giving up to her his house and fields, a certain amount of cotton stuff, a few rings, and a small sum of money. The children remain with their mother, but she cannot re-marry until her divorced husband has taken to himself another wife. (2)\n\nIndustry.\u2014I have already mentioned how the various Negrito populations support themselves. I must add that none of those of whom I speak here are cannibals. (3) This accusation has been\n\n(1) Logan had already alluded to this fact, which is a remarkable feature among these wild and sport-loving tribes. (The Binua of Johore, p 273.)\n\n(2) Loc. cit, p. 268\n\n(3) I must remark here that this paper is exclusively devoted to the study of the Negritos proper. As for the Papua-Negritos, mixed with the Papuas of New-Guinea and the adjacent island-groups, it is very possible that they may have let themselves be carried away by example and may have addicted themselves to man-eating; but it is impossible, for want of accurate information, to give an opinion on the subject. The confusion which has too long existed concerning these two races and which is still more or less kept up by some of the most recent travellers, makes it very difficult to study them independently of each other. The examination of skulls permits of our distinguishing the two races, but throws no light on the various characteristics which divide them in other respects.\nbrought against several of these tribes, particularly against the Mincopies. Now, far from having any liking for human flesh, the Andamanese look upon it as a deadly poison. (1)\n\nAll Negritos cook meat by boiling or roasting; all consequently are able to procure fire and no doubt use the same process, the friction of two pieces of wood. This is an uncertain and laborious task, even for savages, and therefore when the first spark is procured, they devise means to preserve it. The Mincopies have invented a peculiar method of their own: \"The large trees are charred in the interior: a great hollow is formed in the centre in which they allow about three feet of ashes to accumulate, under which fire is always found\u2014over the fire of these strange ovens the Min- copie can grill his little pig, fry his fish and prepare his turtle soup.\" (2) Among the Manthras the charred tree is replaced by a heap of clay enclosed in a wooden frame in which fire is carefully kept up. (3) In cold or temperate climates the most urgent wants, after food, are shelter and clothing. In tropical countries, on the contrary, clothes are a matter of luxury and are often more inconvenient than useful. It is almost the same with regard to dwellings. A simple cover, affording shade during the day, shelter from the moon's rays at night, and protection from rain, answers all the most important purposes. Travellers are but too often unmindful of these circumstances, and many writers look upon this extreme simplicity of dress or houses, as a sign of intellectual inferiority and want of industry. The Mincopies have been reproached with wearing no clothes. It is a fact; with the exception of a girdle to which I shall refer further on, their dress is limited to uncouth tattooing or painting such as we see in Mr. Dobson's phototypes. (4) Still, in order to protect themselves against mosquitos or other insects, they are in the habit, when night comes on, of smearing the body with a thick coating of\n\n(1) Day, loc. cit. p. 165.\n(2) Mouat, Adventures, p. 308.\n(3) Montano, loc. cit. p. 46.\n(4) On the Andamans and Andamanese. (The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. IV, p. 457, Pl. XXXI, XXXII and XXXIII.)\nclayey mud, which soon dries and forms a regular cuirass. They can thus sleep in peace; but it is obvious that this night-dress goes a long way towards developing the rheumatic and abdominal diseases to which they are particularly subject.\n\nPerpetually wandering as they do, along their shores, the Andamanese are not given to erecting permanent dwellings. Four poles secured together at the upper ends and covered with broad leaves give them a perfect hut, which is quickly erected and affords capital shelter against rain\u2014the only thing they seem to dread. Such a hut is in reality a kind of impervious tent, the materials of which are entirely supplied by the neighbouring jungie, and which need not be transported from place to place. They could not possibly have contrived anything better, and our own African soldiers would deem themselves lucky, could they but do the same.\n\nThe A\u00ebtas are scarcely better clad than their Andamanese brethren. (1) Further, such of their tribes as are subject to the continual attacks of formidable enemies do not even erect temporary sheds, but sleep in trees, or, as a protection against cold, roll themselves up in the hot ashes of a large fire kindled for the purpose. But we have seen already that, when placed in normal conditions of life, they know how to erect permanent houses and settle down.\n\nThe photographs of M. de Saint Pol-Lias represent the Saka\u00efs as wearing a simple waist cloth tied round the waist with the ends hanging down on the thighs. M. Montano has described the bamboo hut of a Manthra family whom he met living by themselves in the midst of the forest. (2) Though anything but luxurious, this dwelling exhibited the peculiarity of having a floor raised two feet off the ground. In almost all of the houses of our own peasants the bare earth is the substitute for plank floors and in this respect at all events the Malay savage understands hygienic conditions better than the European.\n\n(1) A portrait of an A\u00ebta chief, engraved after a photograph by M. Montano has been given by me in a memoir called\u2014Nouvelles \u00c9tudes sur la distribution g\u00e9ographique des N\u00e9gritos et sur leur identification avec les Pygm\u00e9es asiatiques de Ctesias et de Pline, (Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I, p. 183).\n\n(2) Loc. cit p. 46.\nThe Mincopies live exclusively on hunting and fishing, but owing to their isolation and also to the fables that have been spread concerning some of their habits, (1) they have been free to develop quietly the various industries suited to their mode of life. The results attained by these islanders had already forcibly struck the learned observers who were the first in our time to study the Andamans and their inhabitants. Notwithstanding their contempt for these \"savage negroes,\" Colebrooke, Symes, and especially Mouat have in many instances done justice to their merits in this respect. (2) Thanks to Mr. Man, we are now better acquainted with them. He got together and sent to London a valuable collection illustrating most of the native industries, and of this Major-General Lane-Fox (3) has given an account as interesting as it is instructive. I can only very briefly sum up these various documents.\n\nLet us notice first of all that the Andaman Islands, where iron seems to have been introduced by the Chinese and Nicobarese, have had their stone age, the remains of which are still to be found in ki\u00e6kkenm\u00e6ddings, entirely similar to those of Denmark. These heaps of \"kitchen refuse\" were discovered by M. de Roepstorff (4) and more closely examined by Dr. Stoliczka. (5) Hammers and knives were found in them together with rude hatchets undoubtedly corresponding with the chipped implements of our stone age. Close to these were discovered a polished axe which Stoliczka declares to be identical with the \"celts\" of the neolithic period, and also a real chisel, three inches long, with a sharp edge at one\n\n---\n\n(1) In a paper specially devoted to the Mincopies, I have recorded some of the fables borrowed from Marco-Polo and Arab writers\u2014(Revue d'Anthropologie, Vol. I, p. 40).\n(2) I must here refer the reader to my first paper, already quoted.\n(3) Observations on Mr. Man's Collection of Andamanese and Nicobarese Objects, by Major-General Lane-Fox, F. R. S., with four plates. (The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. VII, p. 434).\n(4) A Short List of Andamanese Text Words. (Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1870, p. 178). The Ki\u00e6kkenm\u00e6dding discovered near Hope Town was about 60 feet in circumference and 12 feet high. Several of such and even larger heaps are to be found in various parts of Chatham Island.\n(5) Note on the Ki\u00e6kkenm\u00e6ddings of the Andaman Islands. (Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1870, p. 13).\nNumerous fragments of sun-baked pottery, decorated with incisions of irregular designs, (1) were found in the same place. The Mincopies still manufacture pots of the same kind, and if they have not yet attained the art of baking pottery in a kiln, this is due, no doubt, to the facility with which they can replace water vessels by a length of bamboo, and cooking utensils by the large shells of the Tridacna and Turbo.\n\nWith the exception of harpoons exclusively used for fishing, the bow is, according to the latest travellers, the only weapon employed in hunting or warfare. (2) The bow used in Little Andaman is very similar to most others, being straight and symmetrically tapered from the middle to the ends. (3) In the Great Andaman, on the contrary, it assumes a peculiar shape. In the middle there is a kind of cylindrical handle of a comparatively small diameter; the two sides, rather wide at first, are flat inside with a convex back; they get thinner towards the extremities and are curved in opposite way so that the whole reminds one of an elongated S. This bow is from $1m75$ to $2m$ in length. (4) It is very hard to bend, and the strongest English sailors were unable to string it. (5) In spite of their small stature and rounded limbs, the Mincopies used it so skillfully and with such power that, at 40 or 50 metres, the arrows penetrated right through the clothes of Europeans and deep into the flesh. Several varieties of arrows are used, among which there is one which might be styled a hunting harpoon. The head of it, to which the point is attached, is very small, whilst the shaft is $1m$ long. The two parts are brought together by means of a strong cord twisted round so as to keep the two independent portions together. When a pig is struck and tries to escape headlong through the jungle, the cord unrolls itself, the barbed point of the\n\n---\n\n(1) Plate XVI of General Lane-Fox's Note represents several of these designs.\n(2) Symes alone has mentioned long spears and shields made of bark.\n(3) Lane-Fox, Pl. XIV, fig. 3.\n(4) Mouat, Loc. cit., p. 321.\n(5) General Lane-Fox observes that the same shaped bow is to be found at Mallico'o. It also resembles the Japanese bow in so far as the ends are not symmetrical. (Loc. cit., p. 440).\narrow remains in the flesh, but the shaft which is dragged after him, keeps on checking the course of the animal which is soon captured.\n\nThe Mincopie canoe has deservedly attracted the attention of the English. It is cut out of the trunk of a tree: outside, it is highly finished; the sides are very thin, and the bottom very thick. Being thus naturally ballasted, it cannot capsize and even when riddled with bullets it does not sink.\n\nThey are propelled by paddles, with marvellous speed. The gig and cutter of the Pluto, manned by picked crews, had a trial with a Mincopie canoe, and were completely beaten; the victory of the savages was owing to the superiority of their workmanship. (1)\n\nIt is useless my dwelling any longer on the various manufactures of these islanders and mentioning their harpoons, nets, &c., Here, again, they prove themselves to be equal, and at times much superior to other races placed in the same conditions of life. The collection made by Mr. Man and the plates which accompany the paper of General Lane-Fox are sufficient to refute all that has been said concerning the intellectual degradation of the Mincopies.\n\nIt is otherwise with regard to the A\u00ebtas, whom persecution keeps in a continual wandering state, and there is nothing surprising in the fact. The only weapons they use in war or hunting expeditions are a short spear, a bow, and one single kind of arrow. But these latter are poisoned, and the slightest wound, if not deadly, causes, at least, long and acute suffering, which La Gironni\u00e8re has described from his own experience. (2)\n\n(1) Mouat, Adventures, p. 315.\n(2) La Gironni\u00e8re was wounded in the finger by one of these arrows, in the removal of the skeleton of an A\u00ebta (the first that was sent to Europe and which is now at the Paris Museum). He took no notice of the wound which he took for the scratch of a thorn. After three days, however, the poison began to act, and fearful suffering ensued; the whole arm was inflamed and the pain extended to the chest. After a whole month of torture, the sick man was reduced to the last extremity. He recovered, however, but, for more than a year, he felt pains in the chest. These symptoms recall, in no way, what travellers and experimenters tell us of the effect of known poisons. It would seem as if the poison used by A\u00ebtas was of a special kind. But perhaps also the treatment had something to do with the sufferings of the intrepid traveller.\nPoison is also employed by the Manthras (1) and other Bermun tribes. But these half-bred Negritos, although knowing the use of bows and arrows, have substituted the blow-pipe for them. (2) In this case, as in many others, we can easily detect the influence of the Malays.\n\nThese Malacca Negritos are also acquainted with the art of setting snares for big game, some of them being strong enough to capture even tigers. They place at the end of a long path, artificially made in the jungle, a strong spear fixed to a tree which is bent back and kept in position by the means of a catch. Any animal passing by, releases the spring, and is instantly transfixed. (3) In India, now-a-days, as in the time of Ct\u00e9sias, the bow is, so to speak, the characteristic weapon of the Dravidian races. The Gonds seem to be the only ones who have given it up and taken to the use of the axe and pike. (4)\n\nIV.\n\nReligious and Moral Characteristics.\n\nBelief in Superior Beings.\u2014Like many other wild races, the Negritos, to whom these chapters are specially devoted, have often been represented as perfect atheists. This is anything but accurate. We must not, in our appreciation of their rudimentary beliefs, start from the ideas which educated Europeans form of religion, even when they declare themselves unbelievers.\n\nOn the strength of assertions made by a Sepoy deserter who had lived for some time with the Mincopies, some writers have, even quite recently, taken for granted that these islanders do not believe in any superior being who has any influence, bad or good, on their\n\n(1) Montano, loc. cit., p. 47.\n(2) Montano; Logan, loc. cit., p. 272.\n(3) Logan, loc. cit., p. 257.\n(4) Rousselet, Tableau des Races de l'Inde Centrale (Revue d'Anthropologie, Vol. II, p. 276).\ndestiny. They forget the formal evidence given by Symes, which I think right to reproduce textually:\n\n\"Their religion is the simple but genuine homage of nature, expressed in adoration to the sun as the primary and most obvious source of good; to the moon as the secondary power; and to the genii of the woods, the waters and the mountains, as inferior agents. In the spirit of the storms they confess the influence of a malignant being, and during the south-west monsoon, when tempests prevail with unusual violence, they deprecate his wrath by wild chorus, which they chant in small congregations assembled on the beach or some rock that overhangs the ocean.\" (1)\n\nThe late statements furnished by Messrs. St. John and Day have still further confirmed the above account of Colonel Symes.\n\nWhen the question has been more thoroughly studied as in other places, we shall perhaps ascertain the existence of a complete rudimentary mythology among the Mincopies. We know as yet, through Mr. Man, that they have preserved some tradition of a deluge. In the south-east of Middle Andaman, they point out a rock, called Wota-Em\u00e9da, on which the first man made his appearance and engraved the history of the creation. Mr. Man has visited this Mincopie Eden, and has given a description of it. It is an isolated boulder of small proportions, the surface of which is covered with irregular grooves due to the action of the waves and storms. (2) Let us hope that Mr. Man will enter into more detail respecting the fables connected with it. (3)\n\n---\n\n(1) Account of the British Embassy to the Kingdom of Ava, p. 282. Major Symes gives the information furnished to him by Captain Stockoe, who had resided for several years in the Andamans and taken great interest in the natives.\n\n(2) The Andaman Islands. (The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. VII, pp. 105 and 455).\n\n(3) This paper was originally published in August, 1882. Since then I have read in \"The Journal of the Anthropological Institute,\" (Vol. XII, Nos. I II and III), the very remarkable paper of Mr. Man \"On the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Andaman Islands.\" Unfortunately the first number, though bearing the same date as mine, was issued some time after, and I was consequently unable to profit by the valuable and detailed account given in it. However, far from altering my essential conclusions, it fully confirms the opinion which I had always maintained touching the religious feelings\nWith regard to the A\u00ebtas, our present knowledge is less advanced. M. Montano says in his notes that he could find among them no form of worship; but judging from personal experience, he refrained from concluding that they were wholly destitute of any beliefs whatever. (1) La Gironni\u00e8re, while declaring that these diminutive Negroes have no religion, informs us that, at times, they worship rocks and trunks of trees which seem to bear resemblance to animal beings. (2) My impression is that in all probability, this homage is paid to something higher than these material objects, perhaps to the spirits or genii of the mountains and forests, for Rienzi tells us that these savages believe in evil spirits called Nonos, to whom they offer up sacrifices. (3)\n\nThis belief in spirits is current among the Bermun tribes, and consequently among the Saka\u00efs, Manthras, &c. Here it is professionally represented by a body of priests or rather wizards called\n\nof the Andamanese. Where certain travellers had only seen most wretched savages, where I had myself only suspected confused but genuine notions, we find in reality a pretty complete mythology and a belief in a true God, invisible, immortal and omniscient, by whom the whole world was created and whom they call P\u00fa-luga. I shall quote Mr. Man\u2019s own words (No. II, p. 157):\n\n\"Of P\u00fa-luga they say that:\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Though His appearance is like fire, yet He is (now-a-days) invisible.\n\nII.\u2014He was never born and is immortal.\n\nIII.\u2014By Him the world and all objects, animate and inanimate, were created, excepting only the powers of evil.\n\nIV.\u2014He is regarded as omniscient while it is day, knowing even the thoughts of their hearts.\n\nV.\u2014He is angered by the commission of certain sins, while to those in pain or distress he is pitiful, and sometimes deigns to afford relief.\n\nVI.\u2014He is the Judge from whom each soul receives its sentence after death, and, to some extent, the hope of escape from the torments of Jer\u2019-eg-l\u00e4r-m\u00fagu (regarding which anon) is said to affect their course of action in the present life.\n\nThis Jer\u2019-eg-l\u00e4r-m\u00fagu is a kind of hell or purgatory which the Mincopies consider as a cold and icy region.\n\n(1) M. Montano had been told that the Bagobogos had no religion. Owing to favourable circumstances, he was able to recognise among them a well defined and anything but rudimentary religious conception, of which he gave us an outline in one of his addresses to the \u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie,\u201d 1877.\n\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 300.\n\n(3) Loc. cit., p. 303.\nPoyang or Pawang. After having given, on this subject, many details, which I need not repeat here, Logan sums up his impressions in the following terms:\u2014\"Among these tribes, we recognise \"a pure Schamamism with its accompanying charms and talismans; \"a living faith fresh from ancient days of Eastern and Middle Asia, \"preserving its pristine vigour and simplicity, ....... untouched \"by the Budhistic deluge ....... and resisting the pressure of the \"Islamism which surrounds it.\" (1)\n\nI hardly need remark that among most Dravidian tribes, even among those who have reached a certain standard of civilization, we can detect, in spite of the influence of different Hindu or Mohamedan sects, a substratum of various beliefs similar to those I have just recorded.\n\nBelief in a future life.\u2014All Negritos believe that the soul survives the body; that it has the same wants as the living, and desires that a regard should be manifested for it. Among the Mincopies it is customary to place a vessel full of water on the grave of the deceased, so that his soul may be able to quench its thirst during the night; a fire is lighted under the stage which bears the body of a chief, in order to prevent his mighty spirit from harming any traveller passing by; the skull and bones, exhumed from the tomb, are worn round the neck as propitiatory to the spirit of the dead; the soul of a stranger is looked upon as harmless, and therefore the body of any one who dies away from his tribe is left unburied. (2)\n\nThe Aetas show great respect to the dead. \"For several \"years,\" says La Gironni\u00e8re, \"they deposit tobacco and betel on \"the tombs. The bow and arrows which belonged to the departed \"are suspended over his grave, on the day of the funeral, and every \"night, according to the belief of his friends, he leaves it and \"goes out hunting.\" (3)\n\n(1) The Binua of Johore. Loc. cit., p. 282.\n(2) The details are borrowed from Mr. Day's memoir. They have all the more weight that the writer gave them \"en passant\" and without having apparently understood their real importance. Observations on the Andamanese, loc. cit. p. 163).\n(3) Vingt ann\u00e9es aux Philippines, p. 301.\nThe Malacca Negritos do not appear to entertain such well-defined ideas. Logan states that the Bermun tribes light a fire on the tomb, for several consecutive nights, in order to prevent the spirit from crying out. (1) M. Montano adds that the Manthras bury their dead sufficiently far from the houses, \"so that they shall not be troubled by the crowing of the cocks.\" (2) But neither of these two writers makes any mention of offerings being presented to the spirit of the departed, though among the Manthras the grave is evidently the object of peculiar attentions. (3)\n\nChastity, Modesty.\u2014M. Montano has given us his experience regarding the chastity of the A\u00ebta damsels. The testimony of Symes leaves no room for doubt that this virtue is found among the Andamanese. Two Mincopie girls who had been taken as prisoners on board an English man-of-war, were soon tranquillised in many respects, but though they had been put by themselves in a separate room, they never went to sleep both at the same time, but watched alternately over each other. (4) Not one of the travellers who have visited the Andamans up to the present time has ever reported having witnessed any of those scenes and scandalous sights so often alluded to by the discoverers of the Pacific Archipelagoes. In that respect, the Mincopie women are unquestionably superior to the Polynesians.\n\nWant of decency is the most common of all the accusations which have been brought against a whole host of wild tribes. But we know that travellers have often been mistaken, so far indeed as to take for the height of immodesty what, in the eyes of the natives, was but an elementary act of decency.\n\nOn this particular point, we lack information with regard to most Negrito races. But as to the Andamans, where the dress of the women is as limited as possible, we know now, thanks to Mr. Man,\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 271.\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 49.\n(3) Montano, loc. cit., p. 50, and Fig. 52, 53, 54 and 55. [But see Mr. Hervey's description of a Jakun tomb in No. 8 of this Journal.\u2014Ed., Journ. Straits Branch, R. A. S.]\n(4) Loc. cit., p. 243.\nthat such a dress does exist and bears a particular name (1) and that appearing without it is considered as indecent. (2)\n\nThough displayed otherwise than with us, modesty nevertheless exists among the Andamanese.\n\nThe history of a Mincopie, brought over to Europe, shows how much this sentiment is developed among these islanders. When a full length photograph was taken of Jack Andaman and \"he\" was told to strip, it was by no means an easy matter to prevail upon him to take off his clothes, and, when he was dressed again, \"he manifested much joy at the restoration of his garments. This savage seemed utterly shocked at the very thought of being seen naked.\" (3)\n\nGeneral Character.\u2014It follows, from the various descriptions given above, that the Negritos, who are the special subject of this Part, are far from deserving the accusations which have been too often brought against them.\n\nThe Mincopies who have repeatedly been depicted as horrid cannibals, have been found, when more closely examined, to be spoilt, capricious but good tempered children. (4) Mouat describes them as a gay, laughter-loving population, fond of singing and dancing. Far from being intractable and cruel, they have shown themselves kind and hospitable when fear was banished from their hearts.\n\nThe English traveller adds that they are courageous, hardworking, skilful and extremely active, and, that under the influence of civilization, they would become intelligent and industrious. (5)\n\nM. Montano tells me in his notes: \"Not only are the Negritos anything but ferocious, but they are really humane. They nurse the sick with much devotion, even when they do not belong to their own family.\" He adds again: \"The Manthras are not wanting in brain power but carelessness and laziness\n\n(1) B\u00f3d-du. This girdle varying in shape, is represented in the paper quoted above. Pl. XIII, fig. 27 and 27 a.\n(2) Observations on Mr. Man's collection, loc. cit. p. 440.\n(3) Mouat, loc. cit. 284.\n(4) St. John, loc. cit. p. 45.\n(5) Adventures, Preface p. XV.\n\"seem to prevent them from making any progress.\" (1) At the same time he acknowledges among them the gentle and soft manners to which we have already alluded. In this, he agrees entirely with Logan. The latter, however, considers the Berman tribes as inconsistent and irritable. They must, says he, be treated as children. (2) St. John uses the very same expression with regard to the Mincopies. It shows once more that these two groups resemble each other, in their moral as well as their physical characteristics. To deny their fundamental ethnical identity is evidently impossible for anyone who has at all studied the question.\n\nConclusion.\u2014However, incomplete this study may be, the conclusion to be drawn from it seems to me to be obvious and easy to formulate. From nearly unanimous testimony, these races have been considered as occupying one of the last stages in humankind. When attention was originally directed to the Mincopies, some learned men of unquestionable merit, were led to believe that the missing link between the man and the monkey had been found at last. We have now seen that this is not so and that, even where furthest removed from change and from mixture with other races, the only things which ennoble a community, the Negritos prove to be true and real men in every respect.\n\nPART IV.\n\nTHE NEGRILLOS OR AFRICAN PIGMIES.\n\nI.\n\nThe African dwarfs of whom the Ancients had a glimpse and the very genuine existence of whom has given rise to so many legends, were only discovered again by modern generations at a late period.\n\n(1) Montano, loc. cit. p. 47.\n(2) Loc. cit. p. 269.\nIn 1625, Battel first made known certain facts ascertained by him in the Loango. (1)\n\nAt eight days march to the east of Cape Negro, (2) is found, according to him, the Mani-Kesock territory, to the north-east of which \"lives a race of Pigmies, called Matimbas. Their stature hardly exceeds that of an ordinary boy of twelve, they are all most uncommonly stout. They feed on the flesh of animals which they kill with arrows. They pay to Mani-Kesock a tribute of elephants' tusks and tails. Though their disposition is by no means fierce they absolutely refuse to enter into the houses of the Marambas or receive them in their own towns. The women are as skilful as the men in archery, and are not afraid of penetrating alone into the depth of the woods, with no other protection than their poisoned arrows. (3)\"\n\nWithout mentioning the source of his information, Dapper gives details of the same kind regarding the Mimos or Bakk\u00e9-Bakk\u00e9s whom he places a little further south, in the very heart of Loango. (4)\n\nMore recent observations, the latest of which does not go back farther than 1861, (5) have come to hand to confirm these ancient data.

Hartmann, Die Negritier, Pl. XIII. These and many of the following bibliographical references regarding the history of Western Negrillos are borrowed from M. Hamy's work.\nDr. Touchard has remarked on the recent disappearance of a Gabonese race, the *Akoas* (1) a small group of whom were nevertheless in 1868, still established in the woods north of the river Nazareth. Admiral Fleuriot de Langle was able to photograph one of them who was a real dwarf. (2) It is the same with regard to the *M'Boulous*, Chekianis or Osi\u00e9kanis visited by M. M. Touchard (3) and Marche. (4) Smothered between the Fans and the Pongoes, they are fast dying out like their brethren, the Akoas.\n\nBy grouping together the information procured by these various photographs and descriptions, M. Hamy has been able to draw an almost complete portrait of some of these African dwarfs. The Akoa, examined by Admiral Fleuriot, \"seemed to be forty years old and was from 1m 39 to 1a 40 in height. He was most beautifully proportioned.......He had a fairly good head, his hair was well placed, and less woolly than those of Negroes properly so called; the nose was straight and the commissure of the lips well defined, exhibiting in no way the bestial stamp so common with certain African types.\" (5) The photograph justifies this description. The head is globular, but relatively strong. The length of it, as compared to the total height of the individual comes very close to the ratio already mentioned by M. Hamy with reference to a Babongo (1/6). (6) The countenance is just a little prognathous. The muscles of the thorax and upper limbs present outlines at the same time developed and rounded; the lower limbs however are more slender, the feet are decidedly flat, and the heels rather too projecting.

Marche describes the M' Bouloous as having an earthy-brown complexion. (1) Admiral Fleuriot confines himself to stating that these dwarfs are not so dark as their taller neighbours.\n\nWe have seen above that the Admiral has only spoken approximately of the height of his Akoa. M. Marche also confines himself to saying that the M' Bouloous hardly exceed 1m 60. Dr. Falkenstein is more precise. The adult Babonko, whom he photographed, was about forty years of age and measured 1m 365. (2)\n\nThe average of these four figures is 1m 428; but as two of them have been given as maxima, we are entitled to consider this average as too high. With regard to stature, the Negrillos of this region would therefore be below Negritos and would come nearer to the Bushmen, who are perhaps the shortest race of men, their mean height being as low as 1m 370. (3)\n\nBut the Negrillos differ from the Bushmen in a most essential anatomical characteristic. These latter are strictly dolichocephalic or sub-dolichocephalic, (4) whereas, on the contrary, the Akosas the Bongos,...&c., are brachycephalic or at least sub-brachycephalic. (5) The measurements of the skulls, brought back by Admiral Fleuriot, M. Marche and others, have removed all doubt as to this fact which a simple glance at the photographs is sufficient to prove. (6)\n\nM. Hamy has not contented himself with recognising and defining the Negrillo type of the tribes that have maintained a comparative purity of blood in Gaboon, lower Ogoou\u00e9 and Loango; he has traced it much farther and has shown that it has had a real and important influence on the formation of several of the popula-\n\n---\n\n(1) Hamy, loc. cit., p. 86.\n(2) The other individual was a young man of fifteen years old who measured 1m 025 only. (Hamy, loc. cit., p. 82.)\n(3) We shall see further on that the Akkas seem to stand below the Bushmen in this respect.\n(4) Their average horizontal index, 77.15, places them in this last category (Crania ethnica, p. 398).\n(5) Their average horizontal index, 83.23, raises them to the upper limit of sub-brachycephalism. (Crania ethnica, p. 350.)\n(6) Among others, the photograph given in the work of Admiral de Langle above quoted.\ntions of the same region and adjacent territories, who are connected with the negro type proper. Availing himself again of materials of all kinds, M. HAMY has proved that crossing of dolichocephalic with brachycephalic Negroes could alone account for the general mixture of characteristics, especially for the morphological differences in the skull, remarked, instance after instance, among various tribes of the valley of the Ogoou\u00e9 of Fernand-Vaz. (1) I need not follow him here in all the details which have brought him to this general conclusion, but will state one single fact only. When M. M. de Brazza and Ballay returned from the perilous journey, which was rewarded by the discovery of the Alima and the Licona, they found, on an island of the Upper Ogoou\u00e9, four skulls and one complete skeleton which are now in the anthropological gallery of the Museum. Two out of these five skulls, have an average horizontal index of 82.24, thus approaching very closely to true brachycephalism. (2) The three others are dolichocephalic. The former are the skulls of Negrillos the latter of Negroes.\n\nLet us add that the observations, gathered by M. Marche among the N\u2019Javis, the Apindjis, the Okotas and the Okoas, show that among these races, who have the skull relatively full, there is a sensible falling off in stature. (3) With the N\u2019Javis, it hardly\n\n(1) I should mention, among others, the study made by M. HAMY of the craniometrical results which Professor OWEN obtained by examining a collection brought from these regions by M. de Chaillu. The English savant had published the rough figures. Our countryman calculated the indices and showed that, out of the 93 skulls, which formed the collection, 49 only were dolichocephalic or sub-dolichocephalic, 11 sub-brachycephalic, and 2 brachycephalic. The intervention of an ethical element belonging to this last type is shewn clearly by this discussion which M. HAMY has made the starting point of his studies on the same subject. (Note sur l\u2019existence des N\u00e8gres brachyc\u00e9phales sur la c\u00f4te occidentale d\u2019Afrique, in the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Anthropologie, 2me s\u00e9rie, vol. VII, p. 210.)\n\n(2) HAMY, Note sur l\u2019existence des N\u00e8gres brachyc\u00e9phales &c., p. 96.)\n\n(3) M. HAMY thinks that these tribes are allied to the Obongos seen by du Chaillu, near Niemboui in the Ashango land, (1\u00b058'54\" south latitude and 11\u00b056'38\" east longitude). These Obongos belong in fact to the small sized populations we are examining now. The young adult male measured by the traveller, was 1m 366 only, and one of the women, 1m 340. But the dirty yellow colour of their skin and especially their short hair, growing in small frizzled tufts, had led to connecting these dwarfs with the Bushmen. However, du Chaillu has not mentioned the characteristic apron and steato-\nreaches $1^m 60$. Among the Akoas, the average height of the men varies from $1^m 50$ to $1^m 52$, that of the women being $1^m 40$ to $1^m 43$. (1) At the same time, the complexion is lighter, prognathism diminishes and the general outline is elegant especially among the women, whose rounded faces have a pleasant expression. It is evident that the negro type proper is modified in places by a distinct ethnological element, and we may consider the whole of this region as having been in former times, and still being to some extent, a centre of a Negrillo population. I shall further on refer again to the distinction which has thus to be made between the past and the present.\n\nI am inclined to consider as a centre of the same kind, another small territory, the Tenda-Mai\u0107, situated much further north and west, in a bend of the Rio-Grande. MOLLIE, who visited these regions in 1818, says \"there is but little uniformity in the general characteristics of the physiognomy of these Negroes but the natives of the village of Faran are remarkable for their small stature, slender limbs and the softness of their voice. They are the true African Pigmies.\" (2) However incomplete this short description may be, it is easy to see that Tenda Mai\u0107 is inhabited by a mixed population, of which these Pigmies are an element.\n\nAlthough Tenda Mai\u0107 is somewhat distant from the spot where the Nasamons (3) of Herodotus were taken prisoners, yet it is difficult not to connect the diminutive men alluded to by the Greek historian with MOLLIE's Pigmies. The upper basins of the Rio-Grande and Niger are not far apart and we may admit, without difficulty, that they were inhabited, in former days, by men of the same race.\n\n(1) MARCHE Trois voyages dans l'Afrique occidentale, p. 342.\n(2) Voyage dans l'int\u00e9rieur de l'Afrique, aux sources du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et de la Gambie, second edn. vol. II, p. 216. The village of Faran is situated about $14^\\circ 15'$ west longitude and $10^\\circ 68'$ north latitude.\n(3) Vide Part I, p.\nThe Gaboon, the Ogoou\u00e9 and the Loango are a long way from Tenda Mai\u00e9, and the existence of Negrillo tribes has never as yet been reported within these limits. I am, however, inclined to believe that all these races of low stature are closely allied one with another. We know that the whole of the Guinea coast has been the same of successive invasions which have brought the conquering tribes of the interior up to the sea-coast. The purpose of the movement of these swarms of tribes, and their murderous customs, of which the Dahomeyans of our own times still furnish a well known example, explain easily how a comparatively feeble race could, and in fact did disappear over a considerable area. The extinction of some of these tribes has just been carried out in our own generation and under our very eyes. It was no doubt one of the last scenes of a drama, the first acts of which were enacted far back in the past.\n\nI shall not enter into more detail, the above being sufficient to lead me to the conclusion that the Negrillos of the Rio-Grande and those of the further end of the Gulf of Guinea are closely related with each other and that both have relation to the small beings described to Herodotus by the Nasamons.\n\nII.\n\nAlmost due East of this Gabonese group of pigmies, there probably exists, in the very heart of Africa, a large centre of Negrillo populations of which the ancients could have had no knowledge. The accounts given to Stanley by Ahmed, son of Djoumah (1) seem to me to be of too precise a nature not to be founded on fact. This ivory merchant had himself seen the small men he spoke of and had had to fight them; he owned having been beaten by them and his statements agree with all the other information collected by the great American traveller. From this ensemble of evidence, it follows that towards the centre of the region comprised within the extensive track of Livingstone, there exists a race of dwarfs called Vouatouas, very numerous, spread over a\n\n(1) Across the Dark Continent. Vol. II, p. 114.\nconsiderable area and in possession of complete independence. (1) As he passed through Ikoundou, (2) Stanley captured an individual belonging to that or a neighbouring tribe. This Vouatoua measured $1^m41$. His head was large and his face was surrounded with uneven whiskers of a light chocolate-brown colour. Like Battel's little Negroes, these Vouatouas are elephant hunters and use poisoned arrows. This combination of physical and social characteristics connect them evidently with the Negrillos above-mentioned. We shall again find similar traits among their brethren, the descendants of the Pigmies of Homer and Pomponius Mela.\n\nThe tradition referring to the latter is by no means lost; it has been kept up, in particular, by the Arab geographers who have placed a river of the Pigmies in the South of Abyssinia. The Reverend Father L\u00e9on des Avanchers is of opinion that this river can be identified with a stream springing from the Anko mountains, a little to the north of the Equator. In this region, about $32^\\circ$ east longitude, this eminent missionary has placed his Wu-B\u00e9rikimos, (3) also called Cincall\u00e9s, which literally means what a wonder! He also saw, in the kingdom of G\u00e9ra, several of these dwarfs whom he describes as \"deformed, thick-set beings, with large heads, and at the most four feet in height\" (about $1^m\\ 30$) (4).\n\nThe particulars collected by M. d'Abbadie from Amace, ambassador of the King of Kullo, and from a woman a native of the neighbouring territory of Kaffa, (5) corroborate the preceding statements. The Malas or Maz\u00e9 Mal\u00e9as would stand a little over\n\n---\n\n(1) In Stanley's large Map this region is placed in about $3^\\circ$ south latitude and $19^\\circ$ east longitude.

(1)\n\nThe data, which my eminent colleague has been good enough to give me, seem to take these diminutive Negroes a little further North. But, even so, this would indicate that here, as in Western Africa, they are scattered over a more or less extensive area, and that their tribes bear different names. Everything, therefore, tends to show that, to the south of the Gallas countries, there exists a centre of a Negrillo population, and I do not think I am too bold in connecting these eastern tribes with the Pigmies of Pomponius Mela, just as I have compared the small beings of Herodotus with the dwarfs of Senegambia. It is useless, I think, my repeating here, in support of this opinion, the arguments which I have mentioned above.\n\nWe know that it is particularly the Pigmies of Homer, living in the marshy region of the Nile, who have attracted the attention of commentators. I have before this recalled the opinions expressed by Buffon and Roulin on this subject. (2) The paper of the Abb\u00e9 Banier sums up the various interpretations offered by other savants, who, also regarding these legends as having a certain groundwork of truth, have tried to identify the dwarfs of mythology with some of the populations known to the ancients. (3) It is hardly necessary to add that these conjectures, which were based on no solid foundation whatever, could lead to no valuable result, and it is easy to understand why earnest investigators should have rejected, as groundless, all that had been said on the subject. It was reserved for modern exploration to give another direction to these researches and to lead to positive conclusions.\n\nIn fact, the further travellers have penetrated in the regions of the Upper Nile, the more evidence they have been able to collect\n\n---\n\n(1) M.

The author endeavours to prove that Pigm\u00e9es have really existed and are to be looked for in ancient Ethiopia. He identifies them with the Pachinians of Ptolemy.\nwith regard to these small sized populations. The existence of true Pigmies thus became more and more probable; so much so that in some instructions framed by a committee of the \"Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences\" for the exploring expedition of M. d'ESCAYRAC DE LAUTURE, the compiler took care to draw the attention of the traveller to this particular point. (1) But we know that it has been in vain that Europeans have travelled up the Nile and have even reached its source; they have never come across these small beings. SPEKE alone saw, at the court of Kamrasi, a deformed dwarf of whom he gives a portrait. But this drawing and accompanying explanation show that KYM\u00c9NIA, far from belonging to a race of Pigmies, was not even aware of the existence of these diminutive Negroes. (2)\n\nIt is SCHWEINFURTH to whom is due the honour of demonstrating that the myth of HOMER concealed a reality, and of proving the words of ARISTOTLE. But to do this he had to cross over from the watershed of the Nile to that of the Ouell\u00e9, to go beyond the land of the Niam-Niams and reach the country of the Monbouttous which he was the first to visit. It was at the court of MOUNZA that he discovered this dwarfish race, still known there under the name of Akkas, the very name which MARIETTE had read at the side of the portrait of a dwarf on a monument of the old Egyptian empire.\n\nFrom the information given to SCHWEINFURTH by ADIMOKOU, chief of the small colony which Mounza keeps near his royal residence, it would seem that the land of the Akkas or Tiki-Tikis, (3) is situated about $3^\\circ$ North latitude and $25^\\circ$ East longitude. This country is no doubt pretty extensive. Living on amicable terms with the surrounding populations, and protected by their mighty neighbour, the Akkas seem to occupy here a continuous area and\n\n---\n\n(1) Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences.

(1) At the time of SCHWEINFURTH's visit, these people were, partially at least, under the authority of MOUMMERI, one of MOUNZA's vassals, who came to pay homage to his suzerain at the head of a perfect regiment of these small Negroes, so that the European traveller was able to see, at the same time, several hundreds of these dwarf warriors. (2)\n\nIn exchange for one of his dogs, SCHWEINFURTH obtained from MOUNZA one of the Akkas of whom he had made a portrait (3) He intended bringing him over to Europe, but the unfortunate NS\u00c8VOU\u00c9 died of dysentery at Berber, South of Khartoum. His skeleton may perhaps one day be found by some traveller and brought to some Museum where it will furnish to science the anatomical indications which are still wanting concerning these people.\n\nThe only records we have as yet, with respect to the Akkas, proceed from the examination of living subjects, and are very few in number. The notes and measurements taken by SCHWEINFURTH were burnt in the unlucky fire which destroyed the fruit of three years' arduous work and toil, and it was anything but easy to make up, even partially, for such a loss. However, M. MARNO had the\n\n---\n\n(1) SCHWEINFURTH, Au c\u0153ur de l'Afrique, p. 110. This journey is one of the most remarkable among those which have so rapidly increased our knowledge of Central Africa. It lasted from the beginning of July, 1868, to the early part of November, 1871, and the greater part of it was made in countries entirely unexplored up to that time by Europeans. The traveller had gathered splendid collections of all kinds and had taken numerous observations, notes, drawings, maps, etc. Nearly all of these scientific treasures were unfortunately destroyed by fire. We can well imagine the grief of the savant thus reduced to relate his travels from memory. His work is none the less most valuable on account of the information obtained about regions which until then were utterly unknown.\n\n(2) SCHWEINFURTH, Au c\u0153ur de l'Afrique, p. 115.\n\n(3) Id. p. 64.

Chaill\u00e9-Long-Bey saw also a woman who had accompanied one of Mounza's sisters to the country of the Niams-Niams. (3) M. Vossion, French Vice-Consul at Khartoum, has given, in a letter that was put at my disposal, a brief description of a grown-up man. But, though these records may corroborate and complete each other, still they would be quite insufficient, had not a favourable circumstance occurred, which furnished European anthropologists with the means of studying personally the curious race under remark.\n\nA traveller, more courageous than learned, M. Miani, had followed on the footsteps of Schweinfurth and also reached the country of Mombouttoos. Less fortunate than his predecessor, he broke down from fatigue, and died, bequeathing to the Italian Geographical Society, two young Akkas whom he had exchanged for a dog and a calf. (4) After various vicissitudes, Tebo and Chairallah, were taken charge of by a man of science and feeling, Count Miniscalchi-Erizzo, who had them brought up under his direction. They could thus be followed and studied at leisure. Their photographs were at the same time profusely distributed by the Geographical Society, and attracted, on all sides, the attention of anthropologists.

Schweinfurth, Owen, Cornalia and Panceri, who happened, by chance, to be at\nfirst to remove all doubt as to the reality of Schweinfurth's discovery. Some persons considered the individuals previously measured by travellers as mere children and believed that Tebo and Chairallah would grow taller.

The Anthropological Society of Madrid seems to have shared the doubts entertained by the Roman Doctor.\n\n(3) Some doubt has been entertained as to the purity of type of Miani's Akkas. M. Hamy expresses, on this particular point, (loc. cit., p. 97) a reservation which is not perhaps entirely without ground with regard to Chairallah. On the other hand, his cephalic index is rather low (77.52); MM. Mantegazza and Zannetti, in their exhaustive work on these Akkas, grounding their opinion on the supposed age of the two subjects and the general laws of growth, had predicted that Tebo would stop below Chairallah (loc. cit., p. 144). The event has confirmed their prediction; Chairallah, still growing, had reached 1m42, whereas Tebo, who has all the characteristics of an adult, and seems to have finished growing, has stopped at 1m41 (Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 406). Moreover, the latter has a very high index (80.23). Therefore, if any doubt can still be said to exist with regard to Chairallah, who may perhaps have been affected by intermixture with a full-blood Negro element, such a supposition can however not apply to Tebo himself.\nhe, exceeded 1m50. (1) The one measured by M. Vossion, was 32 years old and 1m31 in height. Tebo, the older of Miani's Akkas, with all the characteristics of an adult, has stopped growing at 1m41, which is the average for the three figures above. (2)\n\nThe woman measured by Marn\u00f6, was from 20 to 25 years of age and came up to 1m36 (3); the one of Chaille-Long was 1m216; Sa\u00efda, 1m34 (4); the mean height thus being 1m302. The average for both sexes would be 1m356. These figures bring the Akkas, with regard to stature, perceptibly below the Mincopies, and even slightly under the Bushmen, who, to this day, have been looked upon as the smallest people on earth. But the measurements obtained, up to now, among intertropical Pigmies are not numerous enough to allow of this fact being definitively accepted by science. (5)\n\nSchweinfurth describes the Akkas as having a very large head, a wide and nearly spheroidal skull. (6) The latter feature has certainly been exaggerated. The highest index, ever measured on the body, is given by Marn\u00f6's figures and only reaches 82-85, which amounts to about 80-85 for the dry skull. The average, for three young subjects, is 78-03, that is, over 76-00 for the dry skull. (7) This result, far from indicating the true dolicocephalism which distinguishes full-blooded Negroes, agrees on the contrary with the figures that distinguish the Negrillo type as shown above. According to Schweinfurth again, the complexion of the Akkas recalls the colour of slightly burnt coffee. The observations made on\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit, p. 151.\n(2) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 406.\n(3) Loc. cit, p. 461.\n(4) Loc. cit, p. p. 410.\n(5) This reservation is all the more justified that no Akka has ever exhibited so low a minimum (1m14) as the female Bushman measured by Barrow and especially as the individual of the same race to whom Doctor Weisbach assigns a stature of 1m only.\n(6) Loc. cit, p. 124.\n(7) In order to bring back the ratio obtained on the living to what it would be on the dry skull, M. Hamy takes into account the small development of the temporal muscles in young subjects, and reduces the index by one unit only, thus considering the average under remark as being 77.00 at least. (loc. cit, p. 98.)\nTebo and Chairallah are in accordance with this statement. But Count Miniscalchi has observed that their skin became much paler in winter time. (1) Their hair is about the same colour, though lighter in the case of Chairallah. With both it is decidedly woolly and forms gzom\u00e9rules; such is also the beard which has grown on Tebo's chin and upper lip. (2)\n\nSchweinfurth has represented Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9 as very prognathic, the nose being aquiline de profil, though the tip is blended with the upper lip (3); the chin is prominent, whereas, with Bombi, it recedes a good deal and the nose stands out more. (4) In that respect, Tebo's photograph approaches more closely the latter type than the former. (5) The lips are not so thick as with common Negroes, and are even described as thin by M. Vossion and by Schweinfurth as well.\n\nAll statements agree in assigning to the Akkas, men or women, a considerable expansion of the belly which gives to adults the appearance of Negro or Arab children. (6) In the photographs we possess of Tebo and Chairallah, this feature is most conspicuous. M. Panizza, who studied, in an anatomical point of view and by auscultation, the cause of such a development, attributes it to an unusual size of the spleen and of the left lobe of the liver, and also to a large amount of fat accumulated in the mesentery. (7) This distension of the abdomen is attended by consequences which have struck all observers. The chest, comparatively narrow and flat in the upper region, expands lower down so as to encompass this enormous paunch. (8) On the other hand, the protrusion of the belly requires, for the sake of balance in the body, that the lower portion of the spine should\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 301.\n(2) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 405.\n(3) Loc. cit., p. 64.\n(4) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 121.\n(5) Miniscalchi, loc. cit., p. 300.\n(6) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 123; Mark\u00f6, loc. cit., p. 461; Vossion's unpublished letter. However, Bombi's portrait does not exhibit this character,\n(7) Loc. cit., p. 465.\n(8) Schweinfurth, loc. cit.\nalso be brought forward in consequence of which the vertebral column assumes the shape of an S causing the Akkas to look, so to speak, saddle-backed. (1)\n\nIt is obvious, however, that this abnormal development of the abdomen cannot be taken as a true racial characteristic of this people, but is no doubt brought on by their mode of living and nature of the food, and perhaps also by the general conditions of habitat. This we can infer from the personal experience of Count Miniscalchi, who noticed that, after a few weeks of wholesome and regular diet, \"the excessive expansion of the abdomen had disappeared and the spine had resumed its normal state.\" (2) The same change has occurred with regard to Sa\u00efda. (3)\n\nIn order to complete the physical description of these Akkas, I need say a few words about their limbs. The upper ones are long, and the hands very delicately shaped. (4) The lower limbs are short as compared with the bust and have a slight inward bend. The feet also are turned in, but more so than with other Africans. (5)\n\n(1) This conformation has been the cause of a singular mistake and of a good deal of discussion. In a communication to the Egyptian Institute (5th December, 1873), Schweinfurth had compared this bend of the spine to a C. The eminent traveller evidently alluded to the lower portion of the back and meant to say that the concavity of the C was turned backwards. But, acting under the influence of preconceived ideas, and in the hopes of discovering the missing link, which has been the subject of so much active search for so long, some venturesome minds supposed that the C represented the shape of the whole back, that the concavity was turned forward, and that, consequently, the Akkas bore, in that respect, a great resemblance to anthropomorphous monkeys. Before even having seen their photographs, I had combatted, at the Anthropological Society and elsewhere (loc. cit., p. 1519) this interpretation, which is perfectly incompatible with the mode of locomotion in man and with the agility universally attributed to the Akkas. Broca (loc. cit., p. 284) and also MM. Mantegazza and Zannetti (loc. cit., p. 148) have, later on, given the same arguments in support of our common opinion, which is entirely justified by the present state of knowledge on the subject.\n\n(2) Miniscalchi, loc. cit., p. 299.\n(3) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 410.\n(4) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 124. The photographs of Tebo and Chairallah do not justify this compliment, any more than the cast made of Tebo.\n(5) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 123.\nThe Akka women bear a great resemblance to the men. M. Giglioli speaks of Sa\u00efda as having a thick waist, short neck, arms neither slim nor long and hands rather large than otherwise. Her complexion, as with Chairallah, is that of a mulatto; her hair is of a fuliginous black and the grom\u00e9rules are not so distinct; prognathism rather more defined. (1) This description agrees perfectly with the portrait given by M. Chaille-Long, who adds that, in the case of his Tiki-Tiki woman, the breasts were very flaccid, though she vowed never having had any children. (2)\n\nThe physiological characteristics of Akkas resemble those of most savages. Their senses are extremely acute, and Schweinfurth repeatedly bears witness to their excessive agility. According to the Monboukous, these little creatures are wont to bound in the tall grass, after the manner of grasshoppers. (3) Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9 had, in a certain measure, kept up that habit and during the time he stopped with Schweinfurth, was never able to bring a dish without spilling part of its contents. (4)\n\nThe Akkas are very courageous. \"They are men, and men who know how to fight,\" said Moumm\u00e9ri speaking of his followers. (5) They are great elephant hunters and will attack them with a very short bow, and spears hardly as high as themselves. (6) Long-Bey corroborates this statement and adds that the women are as martial as the men and this again fully confirms the information given by Battel. (7)\n\nSchweinfurth draws a miserable picture of the character and intellect of Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9. He describes him as enjoying the sight of\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 410.\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 269. The traveller however ascribes to her very small hands and feet.\n(3) Id., p. 114.\n(4) Id., p. 123.\n(5) Schweinfurth, p. 115.\n(6) Vide portrait of Bombi, loc. cit. Schweinfurth does not mention that their arrows are poisoned.\n(7) Long-Bey, loc. cit., p. 269.\nsuffering in men and animals, and as never having succeeded in learning Arabic or any other dialect of the country. (1) Miniscalchi, on the contrary, found Tebo and Chairallah to be affectionate and grateful pupils, always ready to improve themselves. Both of them, especially Tebo, had a great taste for music. Two years after their arrival in Europe, they knew how to read and write. Their adoptive father showed, in 1879, to one of his colleagues, two letters entirely worded and written out by them without any help whatever; the fac-simile of these specimens was inserted in the proceedings of the Congress. (2) They had not, however, forgotten their mother-tongue and could supply M. Miniscalchi with several hundred words and various information enabling him thus to draw up a grammar which he considers as similar to that of the Niam-Niam language. (3)\n\nWhat have these Akkas become under the influence of a European climate and of an education to which they were submitted, for the first time, these representatives of that ancient and wild race that has settled down at two or three degrees from the Equator? Evidently the question is of great interest, and we must feel grateful to M. Giglioli for having replied to it in detail. (4)\n\nTebo has always borne up very well against the cold winters of Verona. Chairallah has had ague and cough pretty often; he also suffered from rheumatism for the first two or three years, but both are now perfectly well acclimatized, (5) and so is also Sa\u00efda. (6)\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 125.\n(2) Loc. cit., p.p. 302 and 303.\n(3) M. Miniscalchi used to converse with them in Arabic, which they speak fluently.\n(4) Gli Akka viventi in Italia, loc. cit. This memoir was written in 1880, five years after that of Count Miniscalchi.\n(5) Id., p. 407.\n(6) M. Giglioli thought that he could discover, by a simple inspection of the head, that it had grown somewhat longer. The examination of the bust and the measures, necessarily approximative, which I took of this plaster-cast, do not, to my mind, justify this opinion.\nA casting was taken of Tebo, and his bust can be seen at the Museum. By comparing it with the photographs taken in 1874, we see that he has lost somewhat of his infantine looks; his forehead is less prominent, though not so slanting as with Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9. In that respect he comes closer to B\u00f4mbi. Prognathism is rather more defined, but the other features are hardly altered. (1)\n\nThese two Akkas have kept a sensitive and unsettled disposition, like that of children. (2) They are fond of play; their motions are rapid, and, in their promenades, they like to run at a double-quick pace. (3)\n\nTebo is more affectionate and studious, and has always behaved himself well. Chairallah is more intelligent, but has occasionally showed himself spiteful and revengeful. They have, however, never quarrelled with their young friends, and they love each other most tenderly.\n\nBoth of them have been baptized and are observant of their religious duties, though their spiritual leader does not consider their sentiments in that respect as very deeply rooted. (4)\n\nThey have now completely forgotten their mother-tongue, and very nearly all the Arabic they knew. They speak Italian fluently, but experienced at first great difficulty in pronouncing words containing two z (bellezza, carezza).\n\nThey have a great sense of emulation, and, at school, have shown themselves superior to their European companions of ten and\n\n---\n\n(1) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 410.\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 409.\n(3) The above could also apply to Sa\u00efda. However she was not treated in the same way as her countrymen. She remained a servant and was not taught to read and write. She speaks Italian fluently, and a little German, which is the language of her mistress; she is sometimes capricious and very fond of playing with children. (Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 411.)\n(4) Id., p. 409.\ntwelve years old. The notes which their professor showed to M. Giglioli, prove that they went thoroughly well through the various compositions in arithmetic, parsing and dictation. (1) Countess Miniscalchi gave music lessons to Tebo, and M. Giglioli heard him play, on the piano, some rather difficult pieces, with a certain amount of feeling and a good deal of precision. (2)\n\nIn short, we may conclude that, in spite of their small stature, their comparatively long arms, their large bellies and short legs, the Akkas are real and true men in every respect; those who had looked upon them as half-monkeys must be now completely undeceived.\n\nConclusion.\u2014The foregoing facts seem to convey a few general considerations which I will now briefly summarize.\n\nIn proceeding from Senegambia and Gaboon towards the land of the Gallas and Monboutous, we have verified the true existence of human communities characterized, all of them, by a small stature, a comparatively large and rounded head, a lighter complexion than that of Negroes proper, and by similar instincts and customs. With M. Hamy, we must acknowledge that these groups are as many specimens of a special race, the Negrillos, who are, in Africa, the representatives of the Asiatic and Indo-Melanesian Negritos.\n\nThe ancients evidently possessed more or less accurate information respecting these Negrillos, as well as the Negritos. They were the African Pigmies, but they had been placed in three geographical localities where they are no more to be met with nowadays. In order to find them, we must look to countries which are\n\n---\n\n(1) Chairallah had obtained 10 (maximum figure) for dictation and caligraphy; Tebo, also 10 for dictation. Their other notes are 8/10 and 9/10 except for the solution of arithmetic problems, in which Chairallah comes down to 7/10 and Tebo to 6/10. We find here again a proof of the inferiority of Negro races with regard to science.\n\n(2) Id. p. 209. Their education has unfortunately been stopped at present. Both Chairallah and Tebo make part of the household in the Miniscalchi family. (Giglioli loc. cit.)\nmuch further from Europe than was supposed in olden times; moreover, these Pigmies appear to us now as forming isolated agglomerations far apart from each other. Lastly, in one of these homes at least, we are able to witness at present the decline of the race and its fusion with a neighbouring element, which is constantly increasing in strength and number.\n\nAll these facts recall vividly the past, and the present fate of the Negritos must naturally be relegated to the same causes. They show us that, in days gone by, the Negrillos were more numerous and formed more compact and continuous communities, and that they must have been driven back and broken up by superior races. Their history, if better known, would most certainly bear a great resemblance to that of their Eastern brethren.\n\nWhat we know of the latter induces to believe that, in the lands where they are still to be found, these Negritos have preceded the races by whom they have subsequently been oppressed, dispersed and almost annihilated. With regard to Negrillos, similar facts must carry with them the same conclusions. We are thus brought to accept as most probable that these small and brachycephalic Negroes originally occupied at least a great part of Africa previous to the full-blooded Negroes characterized by dolicocephalism and a larger stature. The latter correspond with the Papuas, while the Negrillos are the Negritos of Africa.\n\nThis comparison does not arise simply from a superficial inspection of the African and Indo-Melanesian Negroes; it is also justified by the detailed study of skulls which renders evident the striking connection existing between the two great anthropological formations which represent the Negro type at both extremities of our continent. (1)\n\nHow could such a narrow resemblance have occurred between populations which are separated by so vast a space and by such\n\n(1) *Crania Ethnica.*\nnumerous and different races? Are these affinities the simple result of a common origin? This interrogation, and many others too, had been uttered, even before the late discovery of Negrillos, which has made a reply more urgent than ever. I regret to say that the present state of science does not allow us to offer a satisfactory solution to this problem, assuredly one of the most curious among the many points connected with the geographical distribution of the human race. (1)\n\nThe study of these small negro races suggests one more reflection.\n\nWhen alluding to Pigmies, the ancients mixed up with true facts many exaggerations and fables. Modern science, misled at times by its own strictness, and, dwelling solely on the unacceptable points of these traditions, rejected in a lump all the statements regarding the dwarfs of Asia and Africa. The above proves that science was wrong, and this mistake teaches us a lesson.\n\nWhen there is a question of traditions, of legends connected with people less learned than we are, and especially with wild populations, it is but right to examine them thoroughly, however strange\n\n(1) Logan has studied this question from different points of view, and has developed with much science, the theory that the African Negroes have penetrated into Asia and Melanesia through a slow influxion which has been accomplished by sea. He attributes a great influence to the Malagasy population. (The Ethnology of the Indian Archipelago; The Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia, vol. IV, and Ethnology of the Indo-Pacific Islands, vol. VII.) Flowers is inclined to admit that the small black race which sprung up in the southerly regions of India, has spread itself East and West in Melanesia and Africa, and that the tall Negroes are descended from it. (On the Osteology and Affinities of the Natives of the Andaman Islands; The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol IX.) Allen also derives the African Negroes from Asia and endeavours to prove that they have left traces of their passage in many parts of intermediate countries. (The Original Range of the Papua and Negrito Races; The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. VIII.) Professor Seeley thinks that the Negro race occupied, in former times, a strip of land which extended from Africa to Melanesia and is now submerged. (Quoted by Allen; loc. cit., p. 40.)\nand singular they may appear at first. Many of these accounts contain interesting and true information which is often concealed under superstitions, mistakes, forms of language or erroneous interpretations. The duty of the man of science is then similar to the task of the miner who separates gold from its quartz. Very often he also, with a little work and cautious criticism will succeed in redeeming, from a heap of errors, some important truth.\nVALENTYN'S DESCRIPTION OF MALACCA.\n\n[The following paper is a translation by Mr. M\u00fcller, Government Translator, of Valentyn's Account of Malacca.\n\nA portion of this has already appeared in Logan's Journal, Vol. IV, but as it appears that it was never completed, and matter was omitted which some might find interesting, and, further, that the translation was not altogether to be depended on, I have thought it worth while to insert a trustworthy translation of the whole with a few notes.\n\nD. F. A. H.]\n\nABSTRACT, TRANSLATED FROM FRANCOIS VALENTYN'S HISTORY OF MALACCA (ANNO 1726.)\n\nThe town of Malakka is situated in $2^\\circ 20'$ northern latitude and on $102^\\circ 20'$ longitude, on the Continental Malay coast, which lies easterly of the East coast of the great island of Sumatra, about 8 miles [leagues?] in a straight line from the opposite shore.\n\nPtolemy and the Ancients gave it the name of \"Terra or Regio Aurifera,\" which means \"the country rich in gold,\" or of \"Aurca Chersonesus,\" i.e., \"The Gold Peninsula,\" making it appear at about the 11th degree, where it is joined by a narrow isthmus to Tenasserim and Siam. It is the most southern territory of India.\n\nIt is situated on the point of a neck of land, between which and the N.E. coast of Sumatra is a fine sound, known by the name of the Straits of Malakka, or otherwise, by that of the Straits of Singapore, after a very ancient town commonly called Singapura.\n\nIt covers approximately an area of 1,800 paces in circuit, or of about one mile, and has a strong wall on the sea side of about 600 paces long, being also protected by a solid stone wall on the N.W. or river side. There is, moreover, a stone bastion on the N.E. side, called Santo Domingos, and there was another wall, called Tipah, built towards the waterside, and extending to a strong round bastion called St. Jago, now gone to ruins; there were also other fortresses on the S.E. side and two bastions, making it altogether a\nvery strong place, but in time almost all these fortifications have gone to ruins. We do not mention their names now, as they will appear in the course of this description.\n\nThe convent of the Jesuits, also called St. Paul's Convent, was built higher up in town, and the monastery of the Minorites, otherwise called that of Madre de Deos, stood on the adjacent hills.\n\nThe territory belonging to Malakka extends over a length of 30 miles, and over a breadth of about 10 miles. There are two islets in its vicinity, *Ilha das Naos*, (1) within a gun-shot from the town, and *Ilha das Pedras*, (2) from where they got the stones to build houses, &c. with, beyond the range of gun-shot. The Portuguese carracks and galleons used to anchor between these two islets in 4 or 5 fathoms of water. (3)\n\nOn the North-West side of the town is a wall with a gate and a small fortified turret, and next to it a river, discharging into the sea, with fresh water at low tide, but with salt water at high tide. Its width is 40 paces, and its current is generally pretty strong. It is commonly called \"Chrysorant,\" and there is another river on the East side. (4)\n\nThe country on the other side of the river (being on the same level with the land where the town is built) is joined to it by a wooden bridge; but the ground is very swampy on the South-East side, being generally flooded in the rainy monsoon, with the exception of a small piece along the beach, which lies somewhat higher.\n\nThere are in the town many fine and broad streets, but unpaved, and also many fine stone houses, the greater part of which are of the time of the Portuguese, and built very solidly after their fashion.\n\nThe town is built in the form of a crescent.\n\nThere is a respectable fortress of great strength, with solid walls and fortified with bastions, well-provided with guns, able to stand with its garrison a hard blow. (5) There are, in the fortress, several strong stone houses and pretty good streets, all remembering the Portuguese times, and the tower, erected on the hill, seems to be\n\n---\n\n(1) P\u00falau J\u00e1wa.\n(2) P\u00falau \u00dapeh.\n(3) Only about two fathoms now.\n(4) No traces of this now, except in the large drains near Kampong J\u00e1wa, and Banda Hilir.\n(5) The only remains visible of this now are contained in the curious old gateway (near the residence of Mr. J. E. Westerhout) which bears Portuguese arms, but a Dutch date, viz., 1670; this is probably what is left of the bastion called \"Baluarte Santiago\" as marked in the old plates of the Fortress.\nstill pretty strong, though its interior is falling into decay. This fortress, built on the hill in the centre of the town, is about the size of Delfshaven, and has also two gates, and though one of its sides stands on the hill, yet the other side is washed by the sea. It is at present the residence of the Governor, of the other officers employed by the company, and of the garrison, which is pretty strong. Two hundred years ago this place was merely a fishermen's village (1) and now it is a fine town.\n\nIn former times the town had a population of 12,000 souls; but there are now not more than 200 or 300 families, some of which are Dutch and some others Portuguese and Malays, the latter living in the most remote corners of the town in common attap huts.\n\nAt a small distance from the town are also some fine houses and many well-kept cocoa-nut plantations and gardens with fruit trees, the greater part of which are owned by Malays.\n\nThis town is remarkably well situated for trade, and these straits have been frequented, since the times of old, by much shipping, which still continues from Bengal, Coromandel, Surat, Persia, Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, Siam, Tonkin, China, and from many other countries; the gross revenue in the year 1669 (consisting of 10 per cent. import duty and 3 per cent. export duty, and some other small taxes) amounting to 74,958.18 guilders.\n\nThere arrived in that same year 116 Javanese vessels, besides the Danish, Portuguese and Moorish vessels.\n\nThis place is very convenient for our vessels passing through the Straits of Singapore going from Japan to Bengal, Coromandel, Surat and Persia, and also for vessels bound for Batavia coming from those places.\n\nThe place is not very productive in provisions; everything must be imported from other places, with the exception of fish and some kinds of fruits.\n\nThe productiveness of this place is very poor, compared to that of the Coast [of Coromandel], Bengal, Ceylon, &c.; and the surrounding country bears a barren aspect.\n\nIt is also not safe to venture in the jungle, as it abounds in wild beasts.\n\nOne of my friends, Mr. van Naarssen, told me, that it once had happened to him in person to fall in with a tiger accidentally, and he was sure on several other occasions of being in the neighbourhood of one of these animals, for it was only in that case his horse\n\n(1) i.e., about 1525, or 14 years after the Portuguese took it, in which case it must have greatly fallen from the state in which they found it.\ngot unmanageable. There are, moreover, many elephants and other wild beasts. This same gentleman has told me also, that he once saw a tiger which made a leap at a deer that tried to escape him in the water; the deer did escape, and the tiger was dragged down by an alligator.\n\nThe East India Company has a Governor at this place, who has supreme authority over all the officers and over all the affairs. He is assisted by a Supercargo (as second in rank), an Attorney-General, (1) a Paymaster, and a staff of officers similar to those mentioned in our account of Amboina, performing almost the same duties and receiving the same pay; there are here, besides, several \"Opperhoofden\" (Commandants) of other places or factories, which are under the authority of this Governor, and also an especial \"Shahbandar\" or Collector of the Custom-house duties.\n\nA Council of Police is constituted from among these officers (as also already mentioned under Amboina) forming the Government of this territory; another Council administers the law; and a third one all the ecclesiastical affairs.\n\nThe Malays of these countries are commonly called \"orang di bawa angin,\" i.e., \"the people below the wind\" (to leeward), or else \"Easterlings,\" whilst those of the Occident, more especially the Arabs, are called \"orang atas angin,\" i.e., \"people above the wind\" or Occidentals; this is not that there are no other tribes of that name, but that these two nations are the most renowned, the most ingenious and the most civilised of that race.\n\nThe Malays are the most cunning, the most ingenious and the politest people of the whole East.\n\nWhether they have been thus called after the country, or whether the country has been called after them, will be shown by and by, when we shall have traced their origin as far back as possible, producing it from their earliest history.\n\nThey are of a rather pale hue and much fairer than other natives of India, also much kinder, more polite, neater in their manner of living, and in general so charming, that no other people can be compared to them. Their language, Bahasa Malaya, i.e., the Malay language (whether called after the people or after the country) was not only spoken on that coast, but was used through the whole of India, and in all the Eastern countries, as a language understood everywhere and by every one, just as French or Latin in Europe, or as the Lingua Franca in Italy or in the Levant, to such an extent even that, knowing that language, one never\n\n(1) Prokureur-Generaal.\nwill be at a loss, it being used and understood in Persia, nay even beyond that country on that side, and also as far as the Philippines.\n\nAnd if you don't understand this language, you are considered a very badly educated man in the East, whilst the Malays are accustomed to study it, trying their utmost to enlarge their knowledge of it and to learn also the Arabic; even some among them the Persian language too, and those who are more studious still strive to obtain the knowledge of the Sanskrit, the mother-language of most of the idioms in the East.\n\nThe Malay is spoken nowhere so correctly and so purely as here, though there is still a great difference between the Court language and that of the lower class. The language spoken by the courtiers is so swelling, so interlarded with Arabic (to show their erudition in that language), and differs so much from the common pure language (the former being the adulterated language), since every nation, that speaks this common or low Malay, has mixed some words of their own language with it, that it would not be understood by the common people, for which reason it is used only by princes, courtiers and priests, and therefore considered as the language of scholars. It is by nature a very pleasant, sweet, charming, and yet a very powerful language to express yourself in. A lot of works written in that language, already mentioned by us before, and several fine songs, in which they have transmitted many events of past times, show this plainly.\n\nThe Malay men are generally dressed in a pair of trousers, with a broad blue, red or green garment, worn as a blouse, and a turban rolled round the head.\n\nThey are commonly of a very lively nature, but they always keep open a back door and are not easily to be caught, while they are witty and of great self-conceit.\n\nI do not know another nation in the Indies more cunning than the Malays and the natives of Macassar, for which reason they are not much to be relied upon.\n\nThe women's dress is almost the same as that of other Indian women, or like that of the Javanese women, and consists in a long gown, hanging down to their feet and very often also fastened above the bosom under the arms, the upper part of the body being naked. They tie up their hair in a bundle at the back of their head, though some have another hair-dress, almost the same as that of the Creoles. These women too are generally of a more exalted\nmind than other women of India, and they excel also in loveliness and wit far above others.

H.\n\n\"The other inhabitants are Portuguese, who are well known, or other Indians, who have been already described as Chinese, Guzerattes, Bengalis, Coast-Moors, Achinese and others.\n\nThe commodities produced here are these:\u2014\n\n\"K\u00e9l\u00e9mak,* Agila-wood and Camphor in the Kingdom of Pahang, Tin, Gold, Pepper, Pedra de Porco (Query, Bezoar stones?), Elephant (tusks).\n\nThe imported goods consist of:\u2014\n\n\"All sorts of cloths, more especially Petas Malayu, or Malay cloths.\n\nSurat cloths | Coast Chintz.\nBengal cloths. | Opium.\nGuinea cloths (coarse | Red Woollens.\nblue calico.) | Copper.\nSalampories.\u2020 | Rupees.\nBafta Brotsja.\u2021 | Reals of eight [Spanish dollars?].\n\nThe charges of the garrison and other expenses run very high, sometimes as much as 200,000 guilders (2 tonnen gouds), the reason of which is, that the clear income during the year is often much less than the outlay.\n\nIn the year 1664 and during several years, the expenses were much higher and it was thought proper to reduce the strength of the garrison and bring the expenses within the sum mentioned, 200,000 guilders. Subsequently it was deemed proper further to reduce the expenditure by 40,000 guilders. Orders were given by their Excellencies in 1669 to reduce the extent of the fortifications and a certain Ensign (Vaundrig) was established there from the 17th of January of the year and entrusted with the duties of enquirer.\"\n\n* Marsden quotes Loureiro against Valentyn in support of the contention that \"k\u00e9l\u00e9mak\" and \"gaharu\" (i.e. agila wood or lignum vitae) come from the same tree, and are merely different qualities arising from difference in age, &c., and he quotes also, \"Gahru chumpaka agullochum sparium, R.\" But \"k\u00e9l\u00e9mak\" is the heart of the \"kaml\u00f3ja\" tree, known also as \"poko bunga kubbur.\" The heart of the \"chemp\u00e1ka\" tree, furnishes the \"kas-t\u00e1ri,\" while the heart of the \"k\u00e1ras\" tree produces all the varieties of \"gaharu,\" which are as follows:\u20141st quality, very black, \"\u2014lampam;\" the 2nd \"\u2014tandek\" or \"\u2014sisik;\" the 3rd \"\u2014wangkang\" or \"\u2014buaya;\" 4th, which is not marketable, but is used privately, is the refuse of the 3rd and is called \"gaharu m\u011bdang.\"\n\n\u2020 Half wool, half cotton.\n\u2021 Indian cotton cloth.

These factories are Peirah (P\u00earak), Keidah (K\u00e9dah), Oodjong-S\u00e2lang, (1) and Andragiri. (2)\n\nPeirah, the first named Settlement, situated on this Malay Coast, was subjected to the authority of the Queen of Atsjin (Aceh), and was only kept for the tin trade: the Hon'ble Company had appointed there an Underfactor, to purchase that mineral for ready cash, or to barter it against cloths at fifty Rix dollars the buhar, but the nature of that people is very mean and murderous, which it has shown by murdering in 1651 all the people of our factory at that place. Their Honours have often been compelled to order the Governors of this Government (Malakka) to break up quietly that factory and its lodgings, and to try to find an opportunity to avenge this abominable piece of roguery, which was carried out afterwards, and which we will mention with every particular later on.\n\nThe second outer-factory is Quedah (K\u00e9dah), also situated on this Coast almost opposite Atsjin. We had there also an Underfactor and a Settlement to barter tin, gold and elephants for the Hon'ble Company; but this small kingdom, gave us also now and then so much trouble, that we have been obliged to break up this factory too.\n\nWe shall meet with the two other factories in our history of Sumatra.\n\n[Here follows a list of the Governors and principal Officials of the Government of Malacca.]\n\nLIST OF THE\n\nGOVERNORS OF MALAKKA.\n\nJohan van Twist, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India, ... 1641\u20141642\nJeremias van Vliet, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India in 1645, ... 1642\u20141645\n\n(1) Commonly known as \"Junk Ceylon.\"\n(2) Indragiri.\nArnold de Vlaming van Ontshoorn, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India, 1645\u20141646\nJohan Thyssoon Paijart, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India in 1657, 1646\u20141662\nJohan van Riebeek, Commander and President, 1662\u20141665\nBalthasar Bort, Commander and President, 1665\u20141668\nPromoted to Governorship, 1668\u20141679\nExtraordinary Council of India in 1670 and Ordinary Council of India in 1678.\nJacob Jorissoon Pits, Governor, 1679\u20141680\nCornelis van Quaalberg, Governor, 1680\u20141684\nExtraordinary Council of India in 1682.\nNicolaas Schaghen, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India in 1682, 1684\u20141686\nDirk Komans, Director from 5th January till 26th November, 1686\nThomas Slicher, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India, 1686\u20141691\nDirk Komans, Director from 18th October, 1691, to 1st October, 1692, 1691\u20141692\nGelmer Vosburg, Governor, 1692\u20141697\nGovert van Hoorn, Governor, 1697\u20141700\nBernard Phoonsen, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India in 1703, 1700\u20141704\nJohan Grotenhuys, Director from 18th January to 22nd May, 1704\nKarel Bolner, Governor, 1704\u20141707\nPieter Rooselaar, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India in 1707, 1707\u20141709\nWillem Six, Governor, 1709\u20141711\nWillem Moerman, Governor, 1711\u20141717\nHerman van Suchtelen Governor, 1717\n### SUPERCARGOS OR SECUNDAS.\n\n| Name                          | Years          |\n|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| Johan Verpoorten              | 1641\u20141642      |\n| N.

These three gems (which are now only found in very few libraries), though full of fictions and useless stories, are considered, however, among us as the best historical descriptions written in the Malay language, and which are not only most useful to learn the Malay thoroughly, but in which are also to be found many useful things about the Javanese, Malay and other Kings, not mentioned by another author. The Mohamedan Princes in India and their Priests are almost the unique possessors of those works, and it is the greatest difficulty in the world to get possession of one copy. But I have got them all, as I have mentioned already before, whilst speaking of the Malay language. Though we find in the two first mentioned works and in some other books, particulars clearing up many obscure points, yet the last one mentioned is in this respect the best one, while it gives us all the particulars from the very beginning, even from before the time that it (Malakka) was built, and in quite a decent style (for natives at least).\n\n(1) Hang T\u00faah.\u2014There were nine of these \"hangs,\" champions, of whom an account may be found in Leyden's \"Malay Annals.\" Crawfurd speaks contemptuously of it as a historical work, which it no doubt deserves; but it is useful for the insight it affords into the national customs and manners.\nI really don't know the author of the book *Hangtooha*, but I must admit it to be one of the most decent Malay works I ever have read, of which we will communicate to our readers a summary as briefly as possible.\n\nIf we want to trace scrupulously the origin of the Malays, it is worth while to find out first, whether they derive their name from the country (the Malay Coast and the town of Malacca) or whether that country has been called after them.\n\nThey lived first on the great island of Sumatra (called in former times *Andelis*\u00b9 and also *Maningcabo*,\u00b2 till it was discovered that this was the name of only one kingdom of this island) and there more especially in the kingdom of Palimbang, situated on the inner west coast, at about 8 degrees latitude, opposite the island of Banca, on the river *Malayoo*, which runs all round the mountain *Mahameroo*,\u00b3 and thence downwards to the river *T\u00e1tang* and so on into the sea.\n\n* Every one hearing the name of the first mentioned river, would feel inclined at once to think, that those who had settled there had been called after the said river \"Orang Malayoo,\" i.e., \"the Malayoo people, people living on the river Malayoo,\" others however suppose that that river (also called *Mallajoo* and *Maladjoo*) has received its name from this laborious, industrious, quick and hasty people, while the Malay word for laboriousness and quickness is also *Maladjoo*. But it is my opinion that the Malays got their first name from that river, and that they have given that name afterwards to several coasts and countries where they have settled, though the whole of this country (then nothing but fishermen) has been subdued by the King of Siam, of whom some of these natives have rid themselves a long time afterwards.\n\nAfter having been settled here for some years, without knowing anything about a King to govern them (an obscure period, about which nothing has been mentioned by one author), but not quite pleased with this place, and not always having been left unmolested,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 More commonly \"Indalas\" or \"Andalas.\"\n\u00b2 M\u00e9nangk\u00e2bau, or M\u00e9nangk\u00ebrbau, as to the origin of which name various legends exist, e.g. fight between tiger and buffalo, latter winning; also fight between gigantic Javanese buffalo and buffalo calf, latter victorious; again when R\u00e2ja was first instituted at Bukit Guntang P\u00ebnjaringan a buffalo with golden horns and hoofs issued from a hole in the ground with a herd of followers, but returned to it before his pursuers could catch him and so \"m\u00e9nang k\u00ebrbau.\"\n\u00b3 Maham\u00eeru, the Hindu Olympus.\n\n* This and much of what follows has already been criticised by competent critics, so I will not indulge myself here.\nthey thought it more advisable to elect a King (and such the more while they had greatly increased, whilst still heathens) which first King had the name of Sri Toori Bowana.(1) This Prince has ruled them 48 years, and pretended to be a descendant of Alexander the Great, to whom Demang Laibur Dawang (2) (who then ruled the Malays as a Prince of less fame) resigned his sway, in consideration of his illustrious lineage and while he was a descendant of such a renowned Prince; this happened in about 1160 A.C. (or some years before).\n\nThe Malays crossed under this Prince (Siri Toori Bowana) from the island of Sumatra to the opposite shore, now the Malay Coast, and more especially to its North-East point, known as \"Oedjong Tanah,\" that is, \"the extremity of the country,\" and known among geographers as \"Zir baad,\" which means in Persian \"below wind\" (to leeward), hence receiving a long time afterwards also the new name of \"the people below wind\" (to leeward), or else \"Easterlings\" (above all the other nations in the East), from this so-called promontory where they had settled again, the same name having been given afterwards also to some of their neighbours or other Easterlings. This country has generally been known since that time by the name of \"Tanah Malayu,\" i.e., \"the Malay territory\" or else \"the Malay Coast,\" comprising in a larger sense all the country from that very point or from the 2nd degree till the 11th degree North latitude and till Tenasserim, though, taking it in a more limited sense, only that country is understood, which now belongs under the governorship and jurisdiction of Malacca and its environs; they are also considered above all the real and original Malays and they are, therefore, also called \"Orang Malayu,\" i.e., the Malays, whilst all the other Malays, either closely or far off, as those of Patani, Pahang, Peirah, Keidah, Johor, Bintam, (3) Lingga, Gampar, (4) Haru, and others in this same country or on the islands of Bintang(5)\n\n---\n\n(1) \"Sri Tribuana\" and \"Sri Tribuvena\"\u2014Malay Annals, Leyden.

Scriptures, and consequently called by the ancients \"Regio Aurifera,\" i.e., the gold coast, the gold region.\n\nIt is certain that, leaving Ezion Geber and passing through the Red Sea and so along the shores of Arabia and Persia and from there again along the Coasts of Malabar, Coromandel and Bengal, and so on, skirting along the coast, from one shore to the other and finally along the Kingdoms of Arracan, Pegu, Siam and Tenasserim, till the Malay Coast, this could be done without a compass; but we have amply shown in our first volume and in other places, that it was not this Coast, which was meant by that Ofir, but that it must have been very likely the island of Ceylon.\n\nThe Malays, after having remained at that place for some time, built there their first town, calling it Singapura, and a small sound on the South side of the same town still carries that name.\n\nThe King of Madjapahit (an empire of Java) was in those days one of the most powerful Princes in those quarters. He was not only feared on the island of Java, but he had conquered also many places in Java Minor and in Sumatra and had extended his dominion over several other provinces. (2)\n\nMadjapahit then being one of the first and most celebrated cities, not only of Java, but of the surrounding islands too, the ambition of its Prince induced him to drive this new people out of their country, and consequently to attach a new pearl to his crown. He attacked them several times with large forces and thus forced them to fortify their place more and more.\n\nSiri Toeri Bowana died in 1208, after having ruled them as a brave Prince during 48 years, and was succeeded by Padoeka\n\n(1) On this island is D\u00e4ek, the seat of the Johor sovereign after the abandonment of Johor L\u00e2ma.

This one did not govern them for such a long space of time; he died after a period of 15 years. He did nothing of importance, only extending the recently built town and fortifying it a little more, so as to be able to withstand better the plots of the mighty Prince of Madjapahit, who did not leave him in peace.\n\nHe died A.D. 1223, and was then succeeded by the third King, SIRI RAMA WIKARAM. This was a young and brave King, who ruled them during 13 years with moderation, and who commenced to be feared all round, but he died very suddenly in 1236, to the great grief of his people, who liked him very much.\n\nHis successor was SIRI MAHA RAJA, who was the fourth King and who also made a very good figure and extended the town greatly. He governed them $12\\frac{1}{2}$ years with great care, and was also very much liked by his subjects and feared by his enemies. He died in 1249.\n\nThat same year SIRI ISKANDER SHAH was elevated to the crown in his place as the last King of Singapura. He resisted the mighty King of Madjapahit in the first three years of his reign, but was so hard pressed by him at the end of 1252, that he had to abandon Singapura and to migrate higher up to the North side and from thence to the West side of this country, where he laid foundation of a new town in 1253. Including him, five kings had ruled in Singapura during a period of 91 years. He embellished that new place gradually to such an extent that, among the three great and celebrated cities in those quarters of the East, this place was considered afterwards to be the third in rank, or next to Pasi in Sumatra, which stood second next to Madjapahit. He called this new town Malakka, after a certain tree\u2014\"Kajoo Malakka,\" or the Malakka, otherwise called the Mirabolan or the pentagonal tree. While it happened that he commenced to build the town * at the very spot where he had taken some rest under such a tree, whilst waiting there till the dogs dislodged the game, one day that he was hunting in those environs, all which particulars are told at large in the book Hanicowak. The former Kings of Madjapahit, not yet satisfied with the conquest of Singapura, crossed to the opposite shore of the island of Sumatra and took there the kingdom of Indragiri. Since then, they have always made one of the Javanese princes, related to them, King of that realm, and we shall find afterwards one of the Kings of\n\n* Mr. MAXWELL has drawn attention to the existence of a similar legend amongst the Guzaratis. (Journ. Roy. A.S. Soc'y, XIII, N.S.)\nMalakka as a King on that throne, invested with that authority by the King of Madjapahit.\n\nIn the meantime this town (Malakka) and this renowned people increased under this prince very much in importance and in power, and it was this King who laid the foundation of a permanent kingdom.\n\nHe lived till 1274 A.D., and died after having governed this people during 25 years, having swayed the sceptre three years in Singapura and 22 years as the first King of Malakka, feared by his neighbours, and beloved by his subjects. Sultan Magat succeeded him that same year as the second Malay King at Malakka.\n\nThis prince died after a short reign of two years, and on his death the Malays had been governed 115 years and 6 months by Heathen Kings.\n\nHe was succeeded in 1276 by Sultan Mohammed Shah, the seventh King of the Malays, and the third of Malakka, who was the first Mohammedan Prince of Malakka; he became famous, while he strongly propagated this new religion and greatly enlarged his empire during the 57 years that he governed this kingdom.\n\nIt seems that it was he who transferred the name of Malajoo to the adjacent islands of Lingga and Bintam or Bintang, South of the Promontory of the Malay Coast, and that he made that name famous among the natives of Djohor, Patani, Keidah (otherwise called Quedah), Feirah and of other places even on the opposite coast of Sumatra and Gampar (1) and Haru, and that the inhabitants of those quarters, feared him so much, that apparently all their countries were then already subjected to him.\n\nNot satisfied with those conquests, he married in the last years of his reign, the Princess of Arracan, heiress of that King, thus subjecting that kingdom by inheritance, installing the Prince, whom he appointed there and who had been selected among the Malays Mangkubumi, i.e., Chancellor of the Kingdom of Malakka.\n\nHe died A.D. 1333, after having reached a very advanced age, leaving to his son Sultan Aboo Shahid (the eighth King of the Malays, the fourth of Malakka, and the second Mohammedan King) a peaceable kingdom. But this Prince did not possess it a very long time, for he was stabbed by the King of Arracan in 1334, after a reign of but one year and five months, leaving the kingdom in the same condition as his father had left it to him.\n\nHe was succeeded that same year by Sultan Modafar Shah (as\n\n(1) Kampar, see note (4) page 64.\nthe ninth King of the Malays, the fifth of Malakka, and the third Mohammedan King). This King governed his people with great sagacity and very carefully.\n\nHe shewed his sagacity in leaving to his people a book full of sublime rules and maxims, called \"The Statutes of Malakka,\" and he has given also many proofs of his valour during his reign of 40 years.\n\nA very mighty Prince, called Boobatnja governed in 1340 the Kingdom of Siam (then called Sjaharnan or Sornan).\n\nThis King who had overpowered the countries all round his empire, having also received reports of the celebrated commercial town of Malakka, was jealous of its rise, challenged it to surrender, and when King Modafar would not submit to him, he ordered his General Awri Isjakar to attack it.\n\nA fierce battle ensued between these two Princes, or rather between their Generals, but Siri Nara Diraja, the General of Malakka, behaved so valiantly, that he forced the Siamese to retreat with great loss and shame. That King of Siam died soon afterwards, and was succeeded by one Chupandan, who did not leave the matter, but, again attacking the King of Malakka, besieged the town for the second time; but he was as unfortunate as his predecessor, and was also defeated by the same General of Malakka, who gave him such a severe blow in driving him away from the town, that he too died of chagrin a short time afterwards.\n\nIt was at this time that the town of Malakka was considered the third in rank with Madjapahit and Pasi, among the renowned cities in those quarters of the East.\n\nThis Prince governed this kingdom with much glory for some years more, and died in 1374.\n\nHe left his son as his successor, who was first commonly called Sultan Abdul, but called afterwards (when he became King) Sultan Mansor Shah. He was the tenth King of the Malays, the sixth of Malakka, and the fourth Mohammedan King. Many important things happened in these quarters during his reign, and none of his predecessors governed so long as he did, viz., 73 years.\n\nThe Kingdom of Indragiri on the East coast of Sumatra was still under the supremacy of Madjapahit in the beginning of the reign of this King, but when Mansor Shah had married Radin Gala Isjindra Kirana, the daughter of the King of Madjapahit and a Princess of great celebrity, that King bestowed the Kingdom of Indragiri upon his son-in-law, and in this manner Indragiri came under the rule of the Kings of Malakka, who governed it till we came here.\n\nThe King of Madjapahit was at that time (1380), so powerful\nthat he rather ought to have been styled an Emperor than a King, while there were so many Kings submitted to his supremacy, that, when they appeared in his council, he had to show to every one of them their seat according to their rank. He gave the first seat, the place of honour next to him, to the King of Daha; the second seat to the King of Tanjong Pura (Java), who was also married to one of his daughters, Nasa Kusama or Nyai Kasuma and who has succeeded him as King of Madjapahit; and the third seat was the place of the King of Malakka, his other son-in-law.\n\nKing Mansor Shah made also an alliance with the Emperor of China, and married his daughter. After this union he declared war with the King of Pahang and conquered his kingdom.\n\nAt that time Malakka was the first, Pasi the second, and Haru the third city in those quarters of the East: these places were famous, excelling in power and importance. Afterwards he declared also war with the King of Pasi, one Sainalahdin,* and defeated him too.\n\nA short time afterwards, about 1420, Krain Samarlooka, King of Macassar, sent a fleet of 200 sail with a strong army to Malakka, to wage war against that place, but the Laksamana or the Admiral of King Mansor Shah attacked the enemy so valiantly, that he compelled him to retreat, and he retired to Pasi, which place he then besieged, ruining the country all round it.\n\nThe said Sainalahdin, King of Pasi, afterwards had differences with his two younger brothers, who drove him from his kingdom, compelling him to take refuge with this King of Malakka (Mansor Shah), who took him under his protection.\n\nHe besieged Pasi for the sake of this Prince, and reconquered for him his kingdom and its chief town; but afterwards he (Sainalahdin) would not submit to Mansor Shah.\n\nHis reign thus passed in constant wars and military troubles.\n\nHe died in 1447, leaving his son, Sultan Aleddin as his successor.\n\nHe was the eleventh King of the Malays, the seventh of Malakka and the fifth Mohammedan King.\n\nHis reign lasted 30 years, but it does not appear to me, that he performed anything memorable. It moreover seems to me that, under his rule, Malakka must have submitted for a short time to the dominion of the King of Siam.\n\nHe died in 1477 and was then succeeded by Sultan Mahmud Shah, who was the twelfth King of the Malays, the eighth and also\n\n* Zein\u00e9dd\u00edn, or Zeinal\u00e1b\u00e9d\u00edn.\nthe last King of Malakka, and the sixth Mohammedan King.\n\nHe governed this people during 36 years, of which 29 years in Malakka and afterwards 7 years more in Johor. It was under his reign that the Malays threw off the Siamese yoke, and such in 1509; but we will see that at large in what follows.\n\nIt was also during the reign of this King, that the Portuguese arrived for the first time at Malakka, and conquered the country. For the sake of evidence and to clear up the matter, we will mention all those great events from the beginning and treat in due order that part of the history of Malakka and of its Kings till the time, when we arrived in these regions.\n\nARRIVAL OF THE PORTUGUESE AT MALAKKA.\n\nThe Malay historian is not quite correct, when he states that the Portuguese arrived for the first time in these quarters, more especially in Malakka, in the beginning of the 30th year of Sultan Mahmud Shah's reign, for, adding 29 years to the date that he ascended the throne, i.e., 1477, the first arrival of the Portuguese should have happened in A.D. 1506, and it is fully evident from what follows, that they first came here not earlier than two or three years after that date and that they did not conquer Malakka earlier than five years after that date, viz., A.D. 1511. This Prince's reign was consequently a longer one in Malakka and not such a long one in Johor.\n\nKing Emanuel of Portugal ordered in 1508 Jacob Sequeira, (1) one of his Admirals (according to Marfejus it was the Admiral Didacus Lopes), to go with 4 vessels of his fleet of 16 sail to Malakka to make a treaty of friendship with the King of that country, then Sultan Mahmud Shah.\n\nArrived at Cochin, he first went in 1509 to Sumatra, touched at Acheen, and finally arrived thence at Malakka.\n\nHe met King Mahmud at that place, who had then just revolted from the King of Siam, under whose dominion the Malays had been for a short time. Sequeira, as soon as he had dropped anchor, forwarded one Heronemus Teixiera (1) with a present and with a letter written in Arabic from King Emanuel, requesting the said King of Malakka to allow him (Sequeira) to carry on trade in amity, which the King granted him at once.\n\nNo sooner had Sequeira made a treaty of friendship and of\n\n(1) This name is still met with here.\ncommerce, than the Moors and Arabs pointed out to the King that the Portuguese did not come here to trade, but that it was their intention to drive the Prince out of his kingdom. They spoke so in fear that, when the Portuguese were once allowed to trade here, their own traffic by means of caravans from Cairo and Alexandria in Egypt and to Europe, would be totally ruined.\n\nThey aspersed the Portuguese character to the utmost, and told the King that they had acted in that very manner at Cochin, Cannanore, Ormus and other places, that they had seized upon the said countries and had built fortresses in all those places to vindicate their rights.\n\nThe consequence of these instigations was that Mahmud at once made up his mind to violate his word and to break the treaty already made with Sequeira, and he intended to invite him with his principal officers to a dinner and to kill them all at that party.\n\nThe Moors thought this plot to be carried out as easily as it had been easy to their cunningness to persuade the King to their purposes, but we will see that they did not succeed so readily as they had imagined.\n\nTrue, Sequeira had already accepted the invitation, but, in the meantime, having been informed of the said plot, he pretended to be unwell and betrayed nothing.\n\nThe King had also allowed Sequeira to have a building on shore, in which house Rodrigo Arange (1) had already established himself as the Supercargo, for the trade of the Portuguese.\n\nThe Chinamen living here and a Persian woman had informed Sequeira in time, by means of a tailor, of the intended treachery, but at first neither he nor his companions would believe that it was true, and they went on courting the girls in the town behaving unhastily.\n\nOne Nakhoda Begua and one Isutee Mutis, (2) a Javanese Raja (I really don't know how to spell these names), the wealthiest inhabitants of this place next to the King, meantime did their best to kindle this fire and to confirm the King of Malakka more and more in his hatred to the Portuguese. They made splendid presents to the King and to his uncle, thus trying to obtain their villainous object; but the Admiral of the King of Malakka, an honest man, fully disapproved this shameful treason, and maintained that the King was obliged to keep the treaty at least as long as these new customers had not given him a reason to do something\n\n(1) According to the Commentaries of Albuquerque, \"Ruy de Araujo.\"\n(2) Utimuti, a Javanese title.\nof that kind with some appearance of justice: but all his persuasion, though well-founded, had no effect.\n\nWhen Mahmud heard that his first plot had failed and that the principal reason that Sequeira had not come was, that the promised spices had not been forwarded to him, he sent him word that he would despatch at once the crafts with the goods. Sequeira seemed to be pretty well pleased with this message, but he for his part stationed at the same time some of his boats on four different places so as to be prepared for all eventualities.\n\nThe King sent some embarkations with soldiers besides, who were hidden under the victuals and provisions. He ordered moreover some of his people to conceal their arms under their garments and to try to get access on board of the vessels as dealers in eatables, and to take hold of the opportunity as soon as they perceived a column of smoke going up in the town.\n\nPetrus Maffeius tells us, that Isutee Mutis had ordered his cousin, one Patiakoos, to kill Sequeira, while Sequeira had put his trust entirely in that man and admitted him freely into his presence.\n\nWhen everything had been properly arranged, the crafts paddled to the vessels; they created suspicion, however, by ascending the vessels with too large a number at once and Gracia de Sousa noticing this stopped them and sent Ferdinand Magellaan to Sequeira, to warn him that there was something suspicious in the wind.\n\nIsuti Mutis and his men, eight of which already surrounded Sequeira, who was playing at chess, stood anxiously waiting for the signal on shore, viz., the column of smoke. Sequeira, though warned by Magellaan, did not care at all about it, he only ordered a Mate to ascend the mast to see if the boats, which had their freight, were on the way back already, and continued his game as passionately as ever. Still the signal was not given, and when the Mate, who was in the mast, saw that a Malay drew his Kris and that another made a sign to show the first one, that it was not the right moment yet, he warned Sequeira at the top of his voice, that those Malays were merely waiting for a signal to effectuate their plot.\n\nSequeira called out for his arms just in time and drove the enemies overboard, who, astonished and wild that their attempt again had failed, jumped in their boats and hurried away from the vessels.\n\nThe signal on shore was given just after they had left the vessels, and the consequence was that those who had still stopped\nstraggling in the town, were murdered unmercifully. Twenty of them fled to the house of Rodrigo Arange (1) and Francisco Serrano, and having got a boat in time escaped the massacre.\n\nWhilst Sequeira and his officers were still deliberating with each other about this wicked deed, the King and the Bandahara (Chancellor of the Exchequer) sent an Ambassador to the vessels to apologize for what had happened, offering to punish all the culprits and to deliver unhurt all the Portuguese who were still in Arange's house. The very first thing that Sequeira did, was to claim, that those Portuguese should be surrendered at once, but seeing that the King was continually using subterfuges and that his ships got gradually surrounded by a great many native crafts, blocking him up imperceptibly, he thought it more advisable not to stop any longer, but to weigh anchor, not only to avoid a flagrant breach of peace, but also not to miss his return to India through the Ganges, by the passing of the monsoon. But when he received the intelligence, that d'Almeida (together with whom he had been dispatched) had returned home, he too went back to Portugal. The famous Alfonsus Albukirk, who had been appointed Vice-Roy in 1509, had resolved in the meantime to conquer Aden, in compliance with the orders of his Sovereign; he consequently first sailed with 23 vessels, manned with 800 Portuguese and 600 Natives of Malabar to Ormus, intending to take the usual way, but, prevented by contrary winds, he had to put it off and to take another resolution. He then conquered Goa and made peace at Ormus.\n\nJacob Mendes Vasconsel, backed by several other ship-masters, wanted then to go to Malakka against the advice of Albukirk and actually started to realize that plan; but Albukirk had him brought back by main force, imprisoned him and dismissed several of his advisers.\n\nHe made at the same time a treaty with the King of Pacem (Pasi) and insisted upon the extradition of Nakhoda Begua; but this one having escaped before he could be surrendered, the Portuguese at once pursued him and succeeded in overtaking his ship, he was killed after having defended himself very bravely.\n\nThe following curious fact occurred at his death, viz., that no blood was to be seen first, though he had been stabbed through; but it was discovered then, that he wore a blood-stanching stone\n\n(1) See note (1) p. 71.\nin a bracelet, (1) and as soon as that stone had been removed from his body, the blood gushed from his wounds.\n\nIt was about that time that the King of Malakka, who was still a vassal of the King of Siam, threw off that yoke.\n\nHe (Albukirk) sailed to Malakka on the 1st August, 1511. The Chinamen of that place were kind enough to warn him of an attempt already planned there beforehand against him and promised at the same to assist him, whilst the King sent him a proposition of peace as soon as he had cast anchor. The King of Pahang (the Portuguese pronounce it Pan) to whom Mahmud's daughter had been betrothed a short time before, was also at Malakka, when Albukirk arrived there and it was on the wedding day at the very moment, that some of the allied princes, who had been invited to witness the marriage, were led round, seated on a magnificent triumphal car on 30 wheels, that he dropped anchor.\n\nThe sight of the arrival of Albukirk's fleet disturbed the King and all the wedding guests; the majority of them being natives, they wanted to run away at once, but the King, hearing that he did not want to interfere with their festivities, sent to inquire of him, with what kind of goods he could serve him, upon which he sent the reply that he did not want any new goods, but that he merely came to demand the Portuguese who were still there and those goods which had formerly been detained so deceitfully.\n\nThe King, who had certainly about 9,000 brass guns in the town, tried to put him off with promises and to protract till his fleet, which had left for an expedition, should have returned, and therefore told him, that those Portuguese had escaped; but Albukirk, not inclined to be put off with that excuse and receiving not even the slightest news of his companions on shore, ordered at once to set fire to some houses in the town and to some native embarkations, and thus compelled the King to deliver to him immediately Arange and the other Portuguese, whilst he assured Albukirk, that he wished most ardently to be at peace with him. But when Arange had warned Albukirk not to trust the King, he claimed a place where he could build a fortress, which the King promised him to his choice, putting it off however constantly. Seeing that\n\n(1) In the Commentaries of Albuquerque described as a bracelet of bone set in gold, said to be made \"of the bones of certain animals which were called 'cabeis' (also 'cubais') that are bred in the mountain ranges of the kingdom of Siam, and the person who carries these bones so that they touch his flesh can never lose his blood, however many wounds he may receive, so long as they are kept on him.\"\nthe King tried again to deceive him, he ordered to set fire to his palace. Then the King begged to make peace and accepted the terms made by Albukirk, who demanded the delivery of all the Portuguese, the restitution of the stolen goods, and the indemnification of the expenses for two fleets, which had been despatched this way; but the King's son (whom Maffejus has named Allodin) and the King of Pahang declining to accept the said terms, Albukirk ordered his troops to attack and to plunder the town, and to spare only the properties of one Ninachetu and of Isutinutis, (who had already made peace with him before and had submitted to him) and of all the Javanese who stood under his orders and of a few other individuals, who were his allies in town. The King having been wounded personally dismounted his elephant and fled, and so did the King of Pahang too, and they never returned again.\n\nA few days afterwards he and his General Antonio d'Abreo (1) attacked the town for a second time; a fierce battle was fought, but d'Abreo conquering a certain bridge put the Malays to flight and Albukirk made his entry in the royal palace where he found that the King and his household had already fled.\n\nAllodin having collected the fugitives, was defeated for a second time and compelled to flee to the island of Bintam (situated opposite to Singapore), where he fortified himself in spite of its Prince.\n\nThe Portuguese, once masters of the town, plundered it thoroughly, capturing among other things the 9,000 brass guns. The booty seized at Malakka was so rich, that one fifth of it, i.e., the part reserved for the King (of Portugal), amounted to 200,000 ducats.\n\nAlbukirk appointed Raja Isutinutis, head of the Moors, and Ninachetu, head of the other native inhabitants; he fortified the town, opened the place for the trade, and built of the tombs of the Kings the first Christian Church, devoted to the Annunciation.\n\nHe sent the news of this conquest to the King of Siam, who was very much pleased, that his disloyal vassal had been punished so severely, he congratulated Albukirk on his success and begged him to make an offensive and defensive alliance. The Laxamana (or Admiral of Malakka) came to beg him also to consider him a friend, assuring him, that he had tried to dissuade the King from making war, and Albukirk pardoned him also.\n\nAnd behold now this proud Malakka, the glory and the success of the Malays!\n\n(1) Commentaries\u2014Albuquerque, \"Dabreu.\"\nThe fugitive King Mahmud did not die of grief (1) (as it is asserted by the Portuguese), but he had fled in 1511, to the North-East side of the Southern Promontory of the country, after having ruled Malakka for 34 years; with him a period of 252 years was completed that this country had been under the sway of Malay Kings. He commenced to build a new town at that place (the third one built by Malay Kings in those quarters), enlarged it and finally finished it, and gave it the name of Johor, after the Arabic word \u201cJohor\u201d perhaps, which means \u201ca pearl\u201d also \u201cthe fine human shape.\u201d\n\nHe founded a new empire there, the Kings of which from that date were no longer styled Malay Princes or Kings of Malakka, but Kings of Johor. He reigned two years at that place, died in 1513, and was succeeded by his son, who had not the name of Allodin (according to the Portuguese historians), but who has been mentioned by the Malays as Sultan Ahmed Shah, in their genealogical register of the Kings of Malakka and Johor. He was the thirteenth King of the Malays, the first of Johor, and the seventh Mohammedan King.\n\n[To be continued.]\n\n(1) The Commentaries say he died at Pahang, a few days after his arrival there.\nTHE LAW AND CUSTOMS OF THE MALAYS WITH REFERENCE TO THE TENURE OF LAND.\n\nIntroductory.\n\nHere are, probably, few subjects connected with the Government of a Malay population which are so little understood by Englishmen in the Colony as the principles which account for the point of view from which these people treat the possession of, and rights in, land. Successive generations of public servants in the Straits Settlements have been haunted by a bug-bear known as \"the Malacca Land Question,\" which still makes periodical appearances, and is very far from having been set finally at rest: it is nearly sixty years old and has derived from the joint forces of ignorance and neglect an extraordinary vitality. From time to time a great deal of well-meant labour has been employed in trying to bring Asiatic customs and English law into harmony without the aid of legislation, and it need hardly be said that the task is an endless one. Two systems of tenure have been in operation in Malacca during the greater part of this century, and the present generation of officials have inherited a legacy of confusion in which time develops fresh combinations continually.\n\nIn all the provinces of British India, British Administrators have taken the native revenue system as the ground-work on which to build up a detailed and consistent structure of land-revenue administration. Native tenure has been fully recognised; native law has been studied; the technical terms used in the vernacular to express particular documents, tenures and native officials have been preserved and are employed in all the Courts; nothing so fatal to the prosperity of the country and\nso unsuited to the native mind as the introduction of English real-property law has been dreamt of. Why was the policy of Indian Administrators as regards Malacca directly contrary to that pursued in British India? Principally, I think, because it was not soon enough discovered that the conditions of Malacca\u2014an ancient Malay kingdom and then successively a Portuguese and Dutch Colony\u2014differed fundamentally from those of the modern Settlements of Penang and Singapore, which had no population prior to their acquisition by the East India Company, and to which, therefore, any law of land tenure might be applied without the fear of disturbing existing rights, interests, customs, prejudices or superstitions. Malacca has never been the seat of Government during its occupation by the British, and the land laws and regulations formulated from time to time by officials, more conversant with the English practice introduced into Penang and Singapore, than with native law and custom, have never really fulfilled their purpose.\n\nWithin the last nine years, certain Malay States on the West Coast of the Peninsula have fallen under the direction of British Officers subordinate to the Government of the Straits Settlements, and the latter are, therefore, to some extent, in a position similar to that of the Malacca officials earlier in the century. Unless future generations of public servants are to be confronted by a Perak, a Selangor, or a Sungei Ujong \"Land Question,\" it is difficult to exaggerate the importance of studying very closely, and understanding very clearly, the nature of native rights in land. There is even a danger of imbibing and conveying erroneous ideas on the subject by the use of English technical terms.\n\nThe first proclamation about land issued in Perak under the advice of a British Resident contained such terms as \"fee simple,\" and in Larut, as early as 1876, land was being transferred and mortgaged with all English legal technicalities by the aid of two or three ignorant scribes who brought printed forms from the nearest British Settlement\u2014Penang! It is perhaps doubtful if, to this day, the Malay law of land tenure and Malay thought and feeling regarding land are properly understood by Europeans in Native States, and, if not, there may be reason to fear difficulties in years to come.\nBesides persons in the service of the Native Governments, who are brought, by their duties, into connection with native land-holders, there is an independent class of British settlers\u2014planters, miners and others\u2014to whom it may be important to know what rights in contiguous land their native neighbours may have, and how far they are at liberty to alienate them.\n\nIt has occurred to me, therefore, that it may be useful to summarise, as far as I have been able to ascertain it, the law relating to immovable property in an independent Malay State, and to publish translated extracts from Malay Codes of laws, as well as the judgments of English Judges who have had to deal with the subject. I shall be amply repaid for the trouble which I have taken to examine the available information, and to arrange it in an intelligible form, if increased recognition and respect for the rights of native land-holders should be obtained thereby.\n\nChapter I.\n\nPROPRIETARY RIGHT.\n\nThe customary law of the Malays with reference to the occupation and proprietorship of land differs little from that of other Indo-Chinese nations\u2014the Burmese, Siamese and others. The natural condition of land in Malay countries, from Sumatra to Borneo, is characterised by dense forest, which demands no small labour and perseverance before a clearing is effected and cultivation commenced. Land is abundant, but the population is sparse; there is no restriction upon the selection and appropriation of forest land, and a proprietary right is created by the clearing of the land followed by continuous occu-\nForest land and land which, though once cleared, has been abandoned and bears no trace of appropriation (such as fruit-trees still existing) are said technically to be tanah mati, or \"dead land.\" He who, by clearing or cultivation, or by building a house, causes that to live which was dead (meng-hidop-kan bumi), acquires a proprietary right in the land, which now becomes tanah hidop (\"live land\") in contradistinction to tanah mati. His right to the land is absolute as long as occupation continues, or as long as the land bears signs of appropriation.\n\nThis qualification of the right of the proprietor is the key to several important distinctions which help towards the classification of the subject. Malays practice two kinds of cultivation\u2014either permanent cultivation (wet rice-fields and plantations of fruit-trees) in the plains; or shifting cultivation (dry rice-lands and vegetable gardens) on the hills. In cultivation of the latter kind, the element of continuous occupation, and, therefore, a lasting proprietary right, is wanting. Again, between wet rice-fields and fruit-plantations there is a wide difference in respect to the permanence of evidence of appropriation; the former, if left uncultivated for a few years, are soon covered with brushwood and rank vegetation, in which are harboured vermin of all sorts, to the injury of the crops of contiguous owners, and shew no signs, except the absence of heavy forest, of ever having been cultivated; the latter, on the other hand, even if abandoned, do not disappear for many years, not, in fact, until the insidious growth of jungle chokes and kills the fruit-trees. Malay custom has, therefore, fixed three years as the term within which wet rice-fields, if left uncultivated, shall remain subject to the proprietary right of the owner. If wet rice-land remains uncultivated for more than that period, it is open to the Raja, Chief or headman, within whose district it is situated, to put in another\n\n* \"In practice there may be said to be but one original foundation for land tenures in Burma, viz., that the cultivated-land clearer acquires an absolute dominion over the soil, subject only to contribution for the service of the State.

The title to land, therefore, is essentially allodial.\" British Burma Gazetteer, I, 438.\ncultivator. Abandoned fruit-plantations, on the other hand, may be successfully claimed and resumed by the proprietor, or by any one claiming under him by descent or transfer, as long as any of the trees survive, and the proprietary right is not extinguished until all evidence of proprietorship is gone.*\n\nA general view of the tenure of land in a Malay State has been given by Colonel Low; \u2020 the State selected as a type of the rest being Kedah, as it existed before the Siamese conquest:\n\n\"The sovereign was lord of the soil, which the orang bindang, \"or ryots, cultivated under regular tenures. The chief one was \"termed surat putus, under which the occupier paid at the out-\"set the price of one mas, or rupee, for every orlong of land; \"He received this deed from the Raja, and it was stamped with \"the chops of the latter and his ministers. It was in perpetui-\"ty, and could not be alienated, but was subject to resumption \"by the Government if the possessor allowed the land to go to \"waste within a given period\u2014sometimes thirty years. Instead \"of a regular quit-rent, each ryot capable of labour was sub-\"jected to a capitation-tax of 16 gantangs of paddy and one of \"cleaned rice, which would now be equivalent to nearly a \"dollar. This was occasionally commuted into a copper pay-\"ment.\" But Colonel Low fails to remark, what I believe to be the case, that only a small portion of the land of the State,\n\n* This is what I have myself observed in Perak, and have heard declared by natives to be the custom of the country. It agrees with what Marsden says of the Malays of Sumatra:\n\n\"While any of those (fruit-trees) subsist, the descendants of the planter \"may claim the ground, though it has been for years abandoned. If they are \"cut down, he may recover damages; but if they have disappeared in the \"course of nature, the land reverts to the public.\"\n\n\u2020 Dissertation on Penang and Province Wellesley, p. 6. The practice of using a written document has perhaps been borrowed by the Kedah Malays from the Siamese: \"A Chau Nao, or cultivator, who is desirous of clearing \"ground, applies to the headman of the village. The latter shews his written \"application to the proper officer, who directs him to inspect the land and \"measure it. The applicant, having cleared it, receives a written title; but \"although he is not in it vested absolutely with a right in perpetuity, still \"the land forms thereafter a part of his real property, is alienable by deed of \"sale, or by gift, and descends to his heirs at law. From this it is clear that \"the King can take advantage of so defective a title. Prescription is the \"owner's best safeguard.\"\u2014Colonel Low, Journ. Ind. Arch., I, 337.\nand that the best *padi* land probably, is held direct from the Raja by *surut putus*. The restriction on alienation is, therefore, limited in operation, and the doctrine of proprietary right created by clearing and occupying is general.\n\nThe rules as to proprietary right may be stated as follows:\n\n1. There can be no proprietary right in *tanah mati*.\n2. *Tanah hidop* is of three kinds:\n   (a) Land planted with fruit-trees (*tanah kampong*).\n   (b) Wet rice-land (*tanah bendang*, or, *sawah*).\n   (c) Hill-land taken up for shifting crops (*tanah huma*, or, *ladang*).\n3. The proprietary right in *kampong* land endures during occupation and afterwards as long as any fruit-trees remain as evidence that the land is *tanah hidop*.\n4. The proprietary right in *tanah bendang*, or *sawah*, lasts as long as the land is occupied, and for three years afterwards.\n5. The proprietary right in *tanah huma*, or *ladang*, lasts as long as the land is occupied, which is usually a single season.\n\nThe rights of tenure in a primitive Malay settlement are thus exceedingly simple, if each proprietor is viewed as the owner of the piece of land which he has won for himself from the forest. The *kampong*, or village, is made up of independent holdings, and there is no such thing as a joint ownership, by the inhabitants of a village or tract, of cultivated lands, which is common in India. In long-established and populous settlements, the cultivated lands of which have been transmitted by descent for generations, there has, of course, been time for the operation of all sorts of influences\u2014the result of a comparatively civilised state of society\u2014which have contributed to introduce fresh modifications into the simple rules just enunciated. Thus, it will become necessary to consider, further on, the right of the Raja to a share of the produce, the liability of the proprietor for personal service, the right of the proprietor to sell and mortgage, the law of inheritance, &c.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHUMA OR LADANG CULTIVATION.\n\nThe most primitive form of cultivation known to the Malays, and one that is practised by numerous Indo-Chinese tribes, is the hill-farm system.*\n\nThe Malay peasant who does not possess a suwah, or wet padi field, or who, possessing one, is unable, from want of buffaloes or some other cause, to work it, selects a piece of forest land on the side of a hill and proceeds to clear it by first cutting down (tebas) the under-wood and then felling (tebang) the forest trees.\n\nWork is commenced about March or April, and when the fallen timber is dry it is set on fire; if this is skilfully done and advantage taken of wind, the whole is rapidly consumed, leaving a clear surface for agricultural operations. Charred stumps stick up in all directions on the clearing, and some of the lighter timber is turned to account in making a rough fence round the cultivated patch. Hill-padi (padi huma) is then sown by dropping a few seeds into holes made at short intervals with a pointed stick. Many Malays prefer the ladang system, as it is called, to the wet cultivation on the plains, for one reason, namely, the variety of different edible vegetables which a ladang will produce. Besides the hill-padi, he can grow on his farm bananas, Indian-corn, pumpkins and gourds, sugar-cane, chillies, &c., &c. Sometimes the same piece of land is cultivated in this manner two years running, but usually new land is taken up every year.\n\nThe Sakai and other aboriginal tribes who inhabit the interior of the Peninsula, also practise this system of hill-cultivation, and their clearings may be seen on the sides of the more distant mountains far removed from the districts inhabited by the Malays. Logan observed this among the wild tribes in the South of the Peninsula, and has described their mode of clearing and planting their ladang.\u2020\n\n* \"The custom of 'Chena' farms is of extreme antiquity in Ceylon. It is alluded to in the Mahawanso, B. C. 161, ch. xxiii, p. 140.\"\u2014Tennent's Ceylon, II, 463.\n\n\u2020 Journ. Ind. Arch., I, 455.\nThis is, no doubt, the national Malay mode of agriculture, and characteristically enough it is introduced into the legend which tells of the establishment of a royal line of Indian origin into Malay countries. The two peasant women whom the first Indian king meets when he descends upon the sacred mountain at Palembang, are described as engaged in cultivating a hill-garden (ber-ladang) where they plant hill-padi.* The successive processes of clearing, burning and planting appear to be carried out in Sumatra in precisely the same way as on the Peninsula.\u2020\n\nTennent's description of \"Chena\" cultivation in Ceylon is worth transcribing in full. It will be seen that he regards the disadvantages of the system as outweighed by its advantages:\n\n\"The process of Chena cultivation in this province is uniform and simple. The forest being felled, burned, cleared, and fenced, each individual's share is distinguished by marks, huts are erected for the several families, and in September the land is planted with Indian corn and pumpkins; and melon seeds are sown, and cassava plants put down round the enclosure. In December, the Indian corn is pulled in the cob and carried to market; and the ground is re-sown with millet and other kinds of grain, chillies, sweet potatoes, sugar-cane, hemp, yams, and other vegetables, over which an unwearied watch is kept up till March and April, when all is gathered and carried off. But as the cotton plants, which are put in at the same time with the small grain and other articles that form the second crop after the Indian corn has been pulled, require two years to come to maturity, one party is left behind to tend and gather, whilst their companions move forward into the forest to commence the process of felling the trees, and forming another Chena farm.\n\nThe Chena cultivation lasts but for two years in any one locality. It is undertaken by a company of speculators under a license from the government agent of the district, and a single crop of grain having been secured and sufficient time allowed for the ripening and collection of the cotton,\n\n* Journ. Royal As. Soc'y. vol. XIII, N.S., p. 401.\n\u2020 Marsden, Hist. of Sumatra, 62.\nthe whole enclosure is abandoned and permitted to return to jungle, the adventurers moving onward to clear a fresh Chena elsewhere, and take a crop off some other enclosure, to be in turn abandoned like the first; as in this province no Chena is considered worth the labour of a second cultivation until after an interval of fifteen years from the first harvest.\n\nDuring the period of cultivation great numbers resort to the forests; comfortable huts are built; poultry is reared; thread spun, and chatties and other earthenware vessels are made and fired; and by this primitive mode of life, which has attractions much superior to the monotonous cultivation of a coco-nut garden or an ancestral paddy farm, numbers of the population find the means of support. It likewise suits the fancy of those who feel repugnant to labour for hire, but begrudge no toil upon a spot of earth which they can call their own; where they can choose their own hours for work and follow their own impulses to rest and idleness.\n\nIt is impossible to deny that this system tends to encourage the natives in their predilection for a restless and unsettled life, and that it therefore militates against their attaching themselves to fixed pursuits, through which the interests of the whole community would eventually be advanced. It likewise leads to the destruction of large tracts of forest land, which, after conversion to Chena, are unprofitable for a long series of years; but, on the other hand, it is equally evident that the custom tends materially to augment the food of the district (especially during periods of drought); to sustain the wages of labour, and to prevent an undue increase in the market-value of the first necessaries of life. Regarding it in this light, and looking to the prodigious extent of forest land in the island, of which the Chena cultivation affects only a minute and unsaleable portion, it is a prevalent and plausible supposition, in which, however, I am little disposed to acquiesce, that the advantages are sufficient to counterbalance the disadvantages of the system.\"\n\nForbes,* who also gives a full description of this system of\n\n* British Burma, 281. \"I am not aware that the ludang mode of cultivation offers any other advantage to the Malays than that it is compatible with the enjoyment of a wandering life.\"\u2014NEWBOLD, Straits of Malacca, I, 263.\nagriculture as it prevails among the Karens of Burma, regards as \"their great peculiarity,\" which they possess in common \"with all the hill-races, not only of Burma and Assam, but of \"the whole of India, their unsettled and ever-changing mode of \"life, which entitles them to the designation of 'nomadic cul- \"tivators.' To raise their scanty crops, the virgin forests on \"the steep slopes of the hills must be cleared and burned; but \"the excessive rainfall washes the friable soil off the surface, \"so that only one crop can be raised on the same spot until \"it has again become overgrown with jungle and a fresh \"deposit of earth has formed.\"\n\nThe same practice exists among the more remote and uncivilised tribes in Siam. The husbandry of the people of Laos and of the Karieng tribe is thus described by Pallegoix:\u2014\"Les \"Lao choisissent un endroit fertile dans la for\u00eat voisine, en \"abattent tous les arbres, et y mettent le feu, ce qui donne \u00e0 \"la terre une f\u00e9condit\u00e9 surprenante.\" *.............\" Les \"Karieng, de m\u00eame que les Lao, ont coutume de couper et de \"br\u00fbler chaque ann\u00e9e une certaine \u00e9tendue de la for\u00eat pour \"planter leur riz, changeant ainsi de place tous les ans, ce qui \"les oblige \u00e0 construire souvent de nouvelles cabanes.\" \u2020\n\nCambodia furnishes another example:\u2014\n\n\"La culture par le d\u00e9frichement et l'incendie des for\u00eats \"adopt\u00e9e par les habitants sauvages de l'int\u00e9rieur est encore \"bien plus barbare et plus regrettable.

The Dyaks of Borneo repeat year by year the toilsome operation of clearing forest land for their temporary farms. \"They do not suppose that the soil is in any way incapable of bearing further culture, but give always as a reason for deserting their farms, that the weeds and grass which immediately spring up after the padi has been gathered are less easily eradicated than ground occupied by old jungle is prepared. They never return to the same spot until after a period of seven years has elapsed, which they say was the custom of their ancestors.\" \u2021\n\nAmong the hill-tribes of India, the same primitive mode of cultivation which Himalaic swarms have carried eastward to Burma, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo, may be viewed in the very districts, perhaps, in which it originated. The Kukis (north-east of Chittagong) cut down the jungle on the declivity of some hill in the month of March, and allow it to remain there until sufficiently decayed to burn freely, when they set it on fire, and thus at once perform the double purpose of clearing away the rubbish and of manuring the ground with its ashes. The women now dig small holes at certain distances in the spot so cleared and into each hole they throw a handful of different seeds they intend to rear. ||\n\nThe Abors observe the same method of cultivation, but take three successive crops off it before abandoning it. \u00b6\n\nIn India and Burma the control of this practice has necessarily engaged the attention of district officers, and in some districts fiscal regulations have recognised this system of shift-\n\n---\n\n* Le Royaume du Cambodge\u2014Moura, I, 25, 26.\n\u2020 Journ.

In the Straits Settlements, on the other hand, where the necessity of making every cultivator take out a lease seems to have been the whole and sole guiding principle of the Land Office, the ladang or huma system has never been recognised and regulated. It is still practised, nevertheless, in parts of Malacca at a loss of revenue to the Colony. In Native States on the Peninsula it is, of course, common.\n\nThe following remarks on the temporary cultivation of hill-farms by certain tribes in India and Burma are extracted from Baden-Powell's *Manual of the Land Revenue Systems and Land Tenures of British India* (1882), p. 102:\n\n\"**Shifting Cultivation.**\n\n\"An account, however elementary, of Indian land tenures, would be incomplete without some notice of a customary holding of jungle land which is widely prevalent in parts of India, but which is of such a nature that it is very doubtful whether the term 'land-tenure' can with propriety be applied to it. I allude to the practice of temporary or shifting cultivation of patches of forest, which has in some districts proved an obstacle, or at least a source of difficulty in the way of making arrangements for the preservation of wooded tracts as forest estates, a work which modern science recognises as essential for almost any country, and especially a great continent like India with its climatic changes and seasons of drought of such frequent recurrence.\"\n\n\"In the jungle-clad hill country on the east and north of Bengal, in the Gh\u00e1ts of the eastern and western coasts of the peninsula, in the inland hill ranges of the Central Provinces and Southern India, there are aboriginal tribes who live by clearing patches of the jungle, and taking a crop or two off the virgin soil, after which the tract is left to grow up again while a new one is attacked.\n\n\"This method of cultivation seems to be instinctive to all tribes inhabiting such districts. It seems to be the natural and obvious method of dealing with a country so situated.\n\n\"The details of the custom are of course various, and the names are legion. The most widespread names, however, are\n\"'jum' in Bengal,* 'bewar' (often, but incorrectly, dahy\u00e1) \"in the Central Provinces, 'kunri' in South India, and \"'toung-y\u00e1' in Burma.\n\n\"In all cases the essence of the practice consists in selecting \"a hill side where the excessive tropical rainfall will drain off \"sufficiently to prevent flooding of the crop and on which there \"is a sufficient depth of soil. A few plots are selected, and all \"the vegetation carefully cut: the larger trees will usually be \"ringed and left to die;\u2014standing bare and dried, there will be \"no shade from them hurtful to the ripening crop. The refuse \"is left on the ground to dry. At the proper season, when the \"dry weather is at its height, and before the first rains begin \"and fit the ground for sowing, the whole mass will be set \"on fire: the ashes are dug into the ground, and the seed is \"sown,\u2014usually being mixed with the ashes and the whole dug \"in together. The plough is not used. The great labour after \"that consists in weeding, and it is the only labour after the \"first few days of hard cutting, to clear the ground in the first \"instance, are over. Weeding is, in many places, a sine qua non, \"for the rich soil would soon send up a crop of jungle growth \"that would suppress the hill rice or whatever it is that has \"been sown. \u2020\n\n\"A second crop may be taken, the following year, possibly a \"third, but then a new piece is cut, and the process is repeated.\n\n\"Nature of Right to which such Practice gives rise.\n\n\"When the whole of the area in the locality judged suitable \"for treatment is exhausted, the families or tribes will move off \"to another region, and may, if land is abundant, only come \"back to the same hill sides after twenty or even forty years. \"But when the families are numerous, the land available be-\n\n* \"Jum is the general name used in official reports, but in reality this \"name must be entirely local. In fact no one name can be applied. In the \"Garo hills, in Chittagong, in Goalpara, in Sontalin, and no doubt in every \"other district where this method of cultivation is practised, there is a differ- \"ent local name.\"\n\n\u2020 \"But this is not always the case, where the hill land has long been subject \"to this treatment, or where the soil is peculiar; in the Garo hills, I am told, \"weeding is not required.\"\n\"comes limited and then the rotation is shortened to a number\n\"of years\u2014seven or even less\u2014in which a growth, now reduced\n\"to bamboos and smaller jungle, can be got up to a sufficient\n\"density and height to give the soil and the ash-manure neces-\n\"sary. In its ordinary form, this method of cultivation may\n\"give rise to some difficult questions. It obviously does not\n\"amount to a permanent, adverse occupation of a definite area\n\"of land; nor does it exactly fall in with any western legal con-\n\"ception of a right of user. In some cases it may be destructive\n\"of forest which is of great use and value, in others the forest\n\"may be of no use whatever, and this method of cultivation may\n\"be natural and necessary. The progress of civilisation and the\n\"increase in the population always tend to bring this class of\n\"cultivation into the former category, and then it is very difficult\n\"to deal with. It is impossible not to feel that whatever may\n\"be the theoretical failure in the growth of a strict right, the\n\"tribes that have for generations practised this cultivation from\n\"one range of hills to another, have something closely resem-\n\"bling a right; they have probably been paying a Government\n\"revenue or tax\u2014so much per adult male who can wield the\n\"knife or axe with which the clearing is effected\u2014which\n\"strengthens their claim to consideration. In creating forest\n\"estates for the public benefit, the adjustment of 'toung-y\u00e1,'\n\"'kumri,' or 'j\u00fam' claims has now become a matter of\n\"settled and well-understood practice. In the Western Gh\u00e1ts it\n\"is becoming a subject of difficulty,* but the discussion of the\n\n* \"Already, in the Konkan, whole hill sides have been reduced to sterility,\n\"while the soil washed by the heavy monsoon rains off the bare hill side, has\n\"silted up and rendered useless, streams and creeks which were once navigable.\n\"The difficulty is that the tribes are always semi-barbarous, and the task is to\n\"induce them to overcome their apathy and take to permanent cultivation.\n\"Unfortunately, sympathetic officials, properly alive to the necessity of kindly\n\"treating these tribes, are usually totally blind to the real danger of destroying\n\"the Gh\u00e1t forests, or what is worse, professing to believe it, the belief has no\n\"real hold on them. To abolish this destructive cultivation, serious and sus-\n\"tained effort is necessary; to get the people to settle down, and to procure\n\"for them cattle, ploughs, and seed-grain, requires liberal expenditure. It is\n\"difficult to find officers who have the time or the zeal necessary for the first,\n\"and financial difficulties are likely to be in the way of the second. An easier\n\"course is to draw harrowing pictures of the suffering caused to the tribes by\n\"stopping their ancient cultivation, and to denounce the efforts of the Forest\n\"Administration as being harsh and without recognition of the 'wants of the\n\"question would be foreign to my present purpose, which is merely to describe what is in fact a form of land occupation or quasi-tenure.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter III.\n\nTHE RIGHTS OF THE RAJA.\n\nMonarchical government was introduced among the Malay tribes by Hindu rulers from India, and a new element was thus added to the primitive structure of society theretofore existing. The settlement or group of settlements of individual cultivators (each deriving his right to his holding from the fact that he and his family or slaves had reclaimed it from the forest) who lived in tribes under elected Chiefs, or Penghulus, for mutual protection, now became subject to the incidents of Aryan kingly government.\n\nThe rights of the Raja in the early Hindu kingdoms in India were:\n\n1. The right to a share in the grain.\n2. The right to collect taxes.\n3. The right of disposal of waste land.\n\nThe proportion of the padi crop which the Malay Raja or Chief can claim has come to be fixed by custom at one-tenth of the grain, and payment can be enforced by seizure of the crop or land. A new qualification in the proprietary right of the\n\n\"people.\" It is unfortunate that the very forests at the head-waters of streams with dense growth and steep slopes, which forest economy most imperatively calls on us to preserve, are the very tracts in which this temporary cultivation is most insisted on.\"\nland-holder has thus grown up in some districts. It was explained just now that his right, which was based upon original occupation, is absolute as long as that occupation continues; to this must now be added, \"and as long as a proportion of the grain is paid to the Raja or Chiefs.\"\n\nThe rate of one-tenth of the produce thus leviable by Malay custom is, it should be observed, the same as the rate still collected under a law based upon native custom, in Ceylon. So, in China, \"the land is held as a freehold as long as the sovereign receives his rent, which is estimated at about one-tenth of the produce, and the proprietors record their names in the District Magistrate's Office as responsible for the tax, feeling themselves secure in the possession while that is paid.\"*\n\nIn Cambodia, too, the share of the sovereign is one-tenth of gross produce.\u2020 Low, speaking of Siamese rule in Kedah, says: \"The Siamese, following the code of Menu, affect to exact only one-tenth of the gross produce value, but the tax is more than doubled in practice.\"\u2021\n\nThe right of the Raja to dispose of waste land cannot have been seriously exerted in Malay States in respect of forest land. The old Malay custom which permitted the free selection and appropriation of forest land for the purposes of cultivation was not interfered with, the adoption of any other course being almost impossible in countries the greater part of which was under forest. As regards abandoned land, or land to which there was no heir, it was, no doubt, different, and the rights of the Raja were often duly enforced. It is not difficult to see how the rights of the Raja to demand a proportion of the produce, on pain of forfeiture of the holding, and to dispose of waste land, tended by degrees to create the doctrine that the right to the soil was in the Raja. Such a doctrine did in fact grow up, and being, to all appearance, consistent with the rights exercised by the Rajas, and not incompatible with the proprietary rights claimed by the Malay land-holder, it has received complete acceptance in Malay States. It was\n\n* The Middle Kingdom\u2014WILLIAMS, II, 100.\n\u2020 Le Royaume de Cambodge\u2014MOURA, I, 264.\n\u2021 Dissertation on Penang and Province Wellesley, 6. Journ. Ind. Arch., I 336.\nnot incompatible with the rights of the owner of the proprietary right, for he did not claim an allodial right to the soil, but merely the right to appropriate and keep for himself as much land as he had the power (*usaha*) to clear and keep in cultivation. There was no necessity, from his point of view, to ask in whom the absolute property in the soil was vested; he did not claim more than a usufruct, continuous as long as he chose it to be so, and terminable on abandonment.*\n\nThat the soil of a Malay State is vested in the Raja is a doctrine not now to be questioned, though it may have originated in confusion of thought, the exercise of the rights to collect the tenth and to dispose of abandoned land being assumed to imply the existence of a superior right of property in the soil, to which the rights of proprietorship were subor-\n\n---\n\n* \"In the times of the early Hindu village communities, proprietary rights, as defined by powers to alienate, existed to a very trifling extent. In the more ancient form of community, as has been said, tenures had no market value; and in the later and more democratic communities where rights were more decided, the land was not an individual but a common property, and one man could not without the consent of the others sell to a stranger. Still transactions occurred in the latter case among the members of the community themselves, which showed an individual ownership within that limit. Sales were not common, and mortgages were usually not foreclosable for a very long period; but the latter existed in abundance, showing a certain value in individual ownership of landed property. Individual property in land sprung up earlier than elsewhere in the districts on the western coast, probably owing to the political circumstances which rendered the Government authority weak and the State demands slight. The attitude of the Hindu rajahs with regard to the soil has been much discussed. It probably varied entirely with the circumstances of times and places. The object of Government is to obtain revenues for Government purposes. If it found communities so organized as to be able to farm the villages properly and to render the proper State dues, the Government would not interfere in the direction of the disposal of the lands claimed by the community. If it found an imperfect organization it would be forced to interfere in the disposal of the lands, especially of the waste lands, with a view to the proper development of the country and realization of the revenue. The tendency probably was for the villagers to lean more and more on the Government in these matters, and hence in many parts of the country the State interference became a regular institution. Still there is no evidence that any Hindu government ever took the step of ejecting an occupier; even if they failed to obtain their dues from him they limited their reprisals to personal torture or sale of moveable property. The sale law is not a native institution. The discussion whether the Indian governments are proprietors of the soil, or not, seems to be little more than a dispute about words.\"\u2014*Standing Information, Madras*, p. 78.\ndinate. The right of the subject of a Malay State to appropriate and cultivate, and thus acquire a proprietary right over, land which, though once tanah hidop, has been abandoned and has relapsed into tanah mati, is unquestioned *; it is not inconsistent with any supposed right of the Raja to the soil of the abandoned holding, for Malay tenant right may be established by a cultivator over the land of another. The Raja's absolute property in the soil, is but a barren right, and as he undoubtedly has, independently of it, the right of levying tenths and taxes and of forfeiting lands for non-payment, Malay law does not trouble itself much with speculation about it. Tenant right is the cardinal doctrine of the Malay cultivator, and, as long as that is fully recognised, it does not matter to him who or what functionary or power may, in theory, be clothed with the original and supreme right to the soil. \u2020\n\nWhen Malay laws speak of the grant by the Raja of lands already under cultivation to some Chief or royal favourite, it must be understood that what is granted is the right to exercise the royal privileges of claiming from the cultivators a tenth of the produce and of disposing of abandoned and forfeited lands. The Raja's property in the soil is not parted with, and the tenant right of the cultivators is in no way interfered with.

But eastern despots generally encourage agriculture, and however the case may have stood originally, it is evident from law cases quoted in the digests and decisions that the occupiers of the land have a firm prescriptive, if not an indefeasible proprietary right in it. Perhaps their Kings may have deemed, and with truth, that their own prosperity was linked with the admission of that right; and hence may have arisen the fixed assessment on landed property, which has not altered since the days of the earliest intercourse of Europeans with Siam. It is collected either in kind at 10 per cent. or in money. Ten per cent. on the value of the net produce is here meant. Although this, for Asia, is a light tax in itself, yet when taken in conjunction with the obligation to personal service for the State and with other exactions to which all are liable, it will be found on the whole oppressive. Besides, the Kings will often break through all law, social and moral.\"\u2014Colonel Low\u2014Journ. Ind. Arch., I, 336.\nso much trouble to the officers of the East India Company on their succession to the Government of that Settlement in 1825, were of this nature.* The grantees were nothing more than a species of what are called in India \"Zamindars.\" The absolute right of the cultivators to retain possession of their holdings as long as they paid to the grantees tenths of the produce, was in no way prejudiced, nor was the customary right of every native of the country to take up forest or waste land wherever he pleased and to bring it into cultivation. The grants were in accordance with Malay tenure, and in no sense corresponded with the English idea of a freehold holding. Nevertheless, there are not wanting, on the part of the few remaining grantees, attempts to assert that their rights within the districts granted to them include the fullest proprietorship of the soil, and to act as if they were the owners of the freehold. This is an illustration of the tendency to argue the acquisition of a proprietary right from the exercise of certain powers which, until their history is examined, seem to be inconsistent with any other position. So, in Bengal, the Zamindar, who was, in the inception of the native revenue system, a revenue official, or agent, established in course of time hereditary and proprietary rights and came to be looked on eventually as the proprietor of the district over which he exercised the rights assigned to him. Had the Straits officials from 1825 understood the true bearing of the position, according to Malay law, as the Dutch undoubtedly did (for the same system is recognised in some districts of Java), it would have been possible, perhaps, to have left the grantees in possession of their Zamindari rights, to have assessed the land revenue of their respective districts at a fixed sum, and to have exacted full payment of this, leaving the concessionaire to collect the tenth in detail from his tenantry.\n\nThe following principles regarding land tenure in Java had been laid down by Sir Stamford Raffles only eleven years before the settlement with the Malacca grantees took place \u2020:\u2014\n\n\"The nature of the landed tenure throughout the island is now\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 740.\n\u2020 Revenue Instructions, 11th February, 1814.\n\"thoroughly understood. Generally speaking, no proprietary\n\"right in the soil is vested in any between the actual cultiva-\n\"tor and the sovereign; the intermediate classes, who may\n\"have at any time enjoyed the revenues of villages or districts\n\"being deemed merely the executive officers of Government\n\"who received these revenues from the gift of their lord; and\n\"who depended on his will alone for their tenure. Of this\n\"actual proprietary right, there can be no doubt that the\n\"investiture vested solely in the sovereign; but it is equally\n\"certain that the first clearers of the land entitled themselves,\n\"as a just reward, to such a real property in the ground they\n\"thus in a manner created, that, while a due tribute of a cer-\n\"tain share of its produce was granted to the sovereign power\n\"for the protection it extended, the government in return was\n\"equally bound not to disturb them or their heirs in its pos-\n\"session. The disposal of the government share was thus,\n\"therefore, all that could justly depend on the will of the\n\"ruling authority; and consequently the numerous gifts of\n\"land made in various periods by the several sovereigns have\n\"in no way affected the rights of the actual cultivators. All\n\"that Government could alienate was merely its own revenue\n\"or share of the produce. This subject has come fully under\n\"discussion, and the above result, as regarding this island, has\n\"been quite satisfactorily established\"\n\nThe following description of the mode of creating these\nquasi-manorial rights in Java, and the nature of the rights\ncreated, from which it will appear that the Dutch in their\nEastern possessions have simply adopted the native law of\ntenure and have not introduced one of their own, is translated\nfrom Winckel's Essai sur les Principes r\u00e9gissant l'Administra-\ntion de la Justice aux Indes Orientales Hollandaises (1880), p.\n141. It is entirely in accordance with Malay law, and the\nprinciples laid down apply, to a great extent, to the private\nrights in Malacca which Governor Fullerton bought up,\nwith few exceptions, in 1828:\n\n\"Following in this respect the general Muhammadan law,\n\"at least in part, the ancient Javanese sovereigns* used to\n\n* \"This is still done in Java on the lands of the Susuhunan of Sourakarta\n\"and the Sultan of Jokjokarta. But there the thing has been ably worked\npay their functionaries and shew favour to their relations and favourites, not with hard cash, but by a delegation of sovereign rights consisting in the right to exact a share of the produce of the soil (from one to four tenths) and that of requiring the cultivator to work (in some cases, one day out of every five) either for the pecuniary profit of the lord or merely to gratify his taste for ostentation by swelling his train.\n\nThe delegated ruler (who exercises police control and even administers justice to some extent) is not the owner of the soil in the European sense of the word. He cannot, for instance, evict the cultivator from it; but the latter is obliged to pay the tithe and to take a part in the forced service.\n\nOur ancestors found this system in force in Java and imitated it.\n\nThese sovereign rights have been conceded by the influence of money, but in perpetuity, contrary to Muhammadan law.\n\nThe European governments which have followed have often done this and have had cause to repent it.\n\nBe that as it may, in the Residencies of Bantam, Batavia, Krawang, Cheribon, Tagal, Samarang, Japara, Sourabaya and Pasaruan, there are these 'private lands' (terres par-\n\nby Europeans. They, never natives or Chinese, take on lease, with the consent of the Dutch Government and for twenty years at most, the rights delegated to members of the royal family and to the officers of their Highnesses. It is the Europeans, who, instead of using the corv\u00e9e to secure a numerous suite, turn it to account in indigo factories, sugar-mills and coffee plantations. Often, instead of a share of the produce of the soil, they take a share of the soil itself. This organisation has given incredible scope to European enterprise, has demoralised the native nobility, and has given more intelligent and therefore more indulgent masters to the common people.\n\nIf, as it is high time it should be the case, these phantoms of sovereigns were deprived of their power, and the administration were put on the footing of the 'Government' lands, the source of European industry would dry up, and the common people would not gain very much, from a practical point of view; the minor chiefs alone would profit. Effort was made fifty years ago to put a stop to the 'farming out of the land' (bail des terres), but the ancient system was reverted to, tempered by the, by no means nominal, control of the Dutch officials.\"\nThose of Krawang\u2014only two in number and comprising 313 and 51 villages, respectively, with a population of nearly 180,000 souls\u2014exceed in extent and importance many an European State.\n\nThese little principalities have been objects of dislike to the Dutch power, ever since, dating from the fall of the noble Company, there has been a governing government: to the Company, commerce was always the chief thing. Sometimes the government has repurchased them;\u2020 on other occasions recourse has been had to not very honourable means in order to obtain possession of them.\u2021\n\nIt is certain that these lands, especially those of no great extent and cultivated by Chinese, might support a happier native population. Nevertheless, for some years past complaints have much diminished, thanks probably to the strict control of the government.\n\nHowever that may be, it was supposed in 1854\u00a7 that it was particularly against these absolute principalities that ill-will was entertained in high places, and guarantees were accordingly asked for.

All that we know is that they pay well worked by an European; a little less in the hands of a native farmer; enormously farmed out to a Chinaman,\"\nGovernment is the Krian province in Perak. Before 1874, the coast district lying between the Krian river and Pasir Gedabu was regarded as a personal estate of the reigning Sultan. It contains an extensive area of very fertile paddy-land, cultivated chiefly by Malays of Penang and Province Wellesley, who used in former times to live principally in the British Settlements, giving across to Krian during the padi season and removing their grain, when harvested, to their homes by the sea. The fact that most of the padi was taken out of the country in this way made it easy to collect the tax at the time of export, and at the time I speak of (1874), the headman upon each creek exacted, instead of an assessed tenth, a fixed tax of thirty gantangs of padi for every orlong cultivated, in money or kind, before a land-owner was allowed to export his grain to British territory. Those who lived permanently in Krian and did not export their padi had to settle with the Penghulu at the same rate. He kept a roll of the cultivators in his district, and estimated roughly, or by actual measurement, the area cultivated by each.\n\nThe inhabitants of this district paid also a capitation tax of $2.25 per family, or $1.12\u00bd per every unmarried male adult.\n\nThese taxes were not levied in Perak proper, first, because it is not a great grain-producing country, and taxation would have discouraged cultivators and caused them to abandon cultivation for mining\u2014the principal industry of the State; secondly, because the inhabitants of Perak proper were always available for the performance of forced services of all kinds, whereas the cultivators of Krian were a shifting population who spent most of their time in British territory.\n\nIt is evident that the Krian system of collection at the time of export is one not suited to a country in which the grain produced is intended for local consumption. It is not clear how the tithe of the produce of the Naning rice-fields, which, by an agreement made in 1644, became payable to the Dutch Government at Malacca,* was intended to be collected. It may have been levied upon cargoes coming down the river, but more probably it was never effectually exacted. In Kedah, following the Siamese custom, the practice seems to have been\n\n* Newbold, I, 203.\nto require the cultivator, under fear of punishment, to deliver the tax in money or kind at a certain place. \"Grain-holders were forced to deliver the rice into the Raja's granaries at the price he chose to fix on it, which always left him a profit of about 20 per cent., nor could they sell grain without special permission.\"*\n\nThe method of levying the tenth on the rice-crops in Malacca is thus described by Newbold:\u2020 \"When the grain is ripe, a person on the part of the Government visits the rice-fields, attended by the owner, the Panghulu, or Mata-Mata, of the village and several of the oldest inhabitants, on the spot, in order to agree upon and assess the value of the crop. A difference of opinion will naturally sometimes arise between the taxer and the taxed. This is submitted to the arbitration of the Panghulu and the village elders. But should these persons again assess the crop at a lower value than the Collector's agent really thinks it worth, the latter has still the resource of offering to purchase the whole of the crop on the part of Government, at a price according to the owner's valuation. This proposal, whenever made, has been, I believe, invariably refused. It is not, therefore, improbable, all circumstances considered, that not more than seven or eight per cent., at the most, ever finds its way into the Company's godowns. The tenth in kind on paddy is sold, whenever a good price can be procured for it, on the spot, and the proceeds lodged in the Treasury. The tenth on the other articles of land produce is levied at tolls placed at the entrances into Naning from Malaca, and there immediately sold.\"\n\nThis account describes a purely native procedure, for, fifty years ago, when Newbold wrote, just as at the present time (1884), no mode of collecting the tenth was provided by law. The absence of legal powers to punish the evasion of the well-known customary regulations does not, however, seem to have prevented the collectors from using their position as oppressively in a British possession as in a Native State.\u2021\n\n* Low\u2014Dissertation, p. 7.\n\u2020 Id., p. 261.\n\u2021 Correspondence relating to the Land Revenue System of the Straits Settlements, 1837-44, p. 61.\nSir Emerson Tennent, in his account of Ceylon, though he describes the manner in which the tenth is collected there under British Colonial rule,* does not state how, if at all, this varies from the practice which obtained under the native administration, but I find a very full description of the collection of a tithe on grain in an Asiatic kingdom in Moura's *Le Royaume de Cambodge*, which is interesting as shewing the extreme elaborateness of the procedure found necessary. It is instructive to compare the published descriptions of the efforts made during the last fifty or sixty years to collect the Malacca land revenue, one long history of want of knowledge on one side, and fraud and evasion on the other, shewing \"how cruelly the subject has been neglected and mismanaged,\"\u2020 with what this author is able to state as regards Cambodia, \"no difficulty or delay is ever experienced in getting in this tax\"!\n\n\"The rice-harvest is gathered between November and January, according to the forwardness of the crops. Towards the month of January, the King sends out into each province an envoy, who is the bearer of a royal order conferring on him the right of estimating the rice-crops realised by the owners, and of deciding the portion due to the State, that is to say, a tenth of the gross produce. The envoy is always accompanied on this mission by an agent of the Storekeeper-general of Phnom Penh. They proceed together to the province which has been assigned to them, and exhibit their credentials to the Governor. On sight of the King's seal, the Governor prostrates himself three times; he at once causes candles and joss-sticks to be lighted and places them on the ground in front of him, and he then listens, lying on his face, to the reading of the royal edict. He himself at once draws up instructions to the various employ\u00e9s of his province, so that the task of the envoys from the capital may be facilitated everywhere and that the reception to which they are entitled may be accorded to them. Lastly, the Governor nominates from among the local authorities a third delegate, who forms one, *ex-officio*, of the committee of measurement. This delegate represents the interest of the\n\n* Tennent's *Ceylon*, II, 170.\n\u2020 Blundell\u2014*Journ. Ind.

As\n\"soon as they have settled down and are somewhat rested, the\n\"headman of the village joins them and presents 'the cloth\n\"of the oath,' a piece of cotton stuff five cubits long which is\n\"accompanied by five coins (worth about forty centimes), a\n\"cock, as door-keeper of the sala, and lastly some fresh betel\n\"leaves and peeled areca-nuts. The headman prostrates\n\"himself before his offering, and the royal delegate solemnly\n\"reads out his instructions. This recital over, the headman\n\"swears to conduct himself in the matter as an honest func-\n\"tionary and one anxious for the interests of the State, and\n\"not to lend assistance to any fraud calculated to withhold\n\"any portion of the crops of his district from the researches\n\"of the collectors.\"\n\n\"Next they proceed to examine, house by house, the heaps\n\"of rice; these are valued, and against the name of the person\n\"liable for the payment, there is entered on a register one-\n\"tenth of the quantity found, representing the tax due to the\n\"State; this the proprietor himself is under the obligation of\n\"conveying to the capital, together with a delivery order which\n\"the King's envoy delivers to each cultivator before leaving\n\"their house.\"\n\n\"When the circuit is finished, the Committee return to the\n\"chief town of the province, where three precisely identical\n\"registers are drawn up recording their labours; one of these\n\"registers is for the King, another is sent to the keeper of\n\"the rice-granary, and the third remains in the hands of the\n\"Governor. No difficulty or delay is ever experienced in\n\"getting in this tax.\"\n\n\"Rice which has been exported before the arrival of the\n\"collectors in the district has, of course, had to pay the tax of\n\"one-tenth at the custom house, and the cultivator has nothing\n\"to do but to shew the receipt of the custom-house officers.\"\n\n\"Forest produce, such as cardamums, gutta-percha, bees'\n\"wax, etc., are taxed in a different manner. The inhabitants\nof the forest are required to work these articles; the law\nprescribes what amount each family must furnish to the\nState annually, and everything exceeding this is for themselves.\nTimber is charged with a trifling duty when felled and after-\nwards with a tenth of its value on passing the custom\nhouse.\"*\n\nIt is almost incredible that the Colonial Government has\nnot got proper powers for collecting the tenth, but native cus-\ntom is hardly sufficient warrant to enable Courts governed by\nEnglish law and practice to punish by fine and imprisonment\nbreaches of a purely native revenue system, which has not been\nspecially adopted by the Legislature. Governor Fullerton,\nin a minute dated the 18th May, 1829, asked: \"How are we\nto regulate decisions at Malacca? There the sovereign right\nis one-tenth of the produce; the Dutch made over the right\nto certain of the inhabitants more than 100 years ago. This\nGovernment, by way of ensuring increase of cultivation and\nintroduction of population, redeemed the right. How are\nwe to levy the tenth if refused? The land tenures at Ma-\nlacca bear no analogy or resemblance to any English tenure;\nyet by such they must, in case of doubt, be tried. Regula-\ntions adapted to the case have indeed been sent to England,\nbut until local legislation is applied, and the mode of admi-\nnistering justice better adapted to the circumstances of the\nplace, it seems to me quite useless to attempt the realisation\nof any revenue whatever.\"\u2020\n\nThe problem is still unsolved, as the following extract from\nan official report laid before the Legislative Council of the\nColony last year shews:\u2014\n\n\"The valuation of padi before the assessment of the Govern-\nment tenths seems to be carried on in a perfunctory way.\nThe system is purely customary and its details have never\nbeen regulated by any law. When the padi in a district is\nripe, a Clerk (Eurasian or Malay) is sent there. He visits\nthe rice-fields with the Panghulu. A little of the padi is\ncut and examined, and an estimate is formed of the probable\n\n* MOURA\u2014Le Royaume de Cambodge, I, 264.\n\u2020 House of Commons Papers, 320E., October, 1831.\nyield and what is the assessed tenth. These Clerks are ignorant, and the correctness of their returns is not checked in any way. They are entirely dependent upon the Panghulu for information as to the names of occupiers and the extent of their cultivation. These may vary annually, for it is the cultivator (not necessarily the proprietor, but possibly a tenant for the season only) who has to pay the tenth, and only a portion of a given holding may be under cultivation.\n\nWhen the Clerk has finished his assessment of a district, a copy of his return is made out in Malay and sent to the Panghulu. The latter collects the money from the ryots and pays it to the Land Office, receiving a commission of ten per cent. on the amounts collected. This procedure is sanctioned by custom only and not by law. There is no summary method of punishing a cultivator who cuts his crop before it has been assessed, or a Panghulu who fails to attend the valuation Clerk, or the Panghulu, or Clerk, who makes a dishonest assessment or return.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter V.**\n\n**SUB-TENANCY.**\n\n\"Persons,\" says the Malacca Code, \"who settle on the lands or plantations of others, must obey the orders of the proprietor, and if they oppose him, they may be fined ten tahils and one paha. It is the duty of all the dwellers on the land to co-operate with the proprietor.\"\n\n*Proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements for 1883, p. 392.*\nThis passage indicates the existence of a class of sub-tenants subordinate to a proprietor, and that the tenant right of these people includes fixity of tenure may be gathered from the fact that a refractory tenant is liable to fine only. There is no hint of eviction. The peasant cultivator, or sub-tenant, who enters into occupation of the land of another, with his consent (unqualified as to time), acquires, therefore, a proprietary right, subject to the right of the other to a share in the produce of the land, and subject to the liability of being fined if he does not obey his feudal superior.\n\nThus one proprietary right may spring up within another, and this may go on ad infinitum; in Bengal, since the permanent settlement, as many as eighteen and twenty distinct rights may sometimes be discoverable between the Zamindar and cultivator. So among the Malays a man who, by his personal industry, or by the co-operation of his family and slaves, or by inheritance, finds himself in possession of more land than he wishes to cultivate, can, by admitting sub-tenants, secure himself an annual return, in kind, of grain or fruit, besides adding to his importance by the acquisition of a number of neighbours who are bound to recognise his superior proprietary rights and to obey him on pain of fine. The first proprietor who, as was stated at the outset, is bound to keep up continuous occupation or cultivation, performs this duty vicariously in the persons of his sub-tenants, and they again, if they choose, create fresh sub-tenancies on the same system.\n\nIf cultivation, or the payment of the tenth, ceases on the part of the tenant for a period prescribed by custom (See supra p. 77) his tenant right lapses.\n\nThis is the explanation of the decision in the case of Abdul-latif v. Mahomed Meera Lebe tried in Malacca in 1829. The plaintiff, who brought an action to recover possession of a piece of land, was non-suited. Apparently he was a proprietor who had admitted a sub-tenant on the customary agreement to pay one-tenth of the produce, and he desired to regard this as a tenancy terminable at the will of the proprietor. But the Court upheld the right of the sub-tenant, or cultivator, to fixity of tenure as long as the land was kept in cultivation and the tenth paid. (See Appendix, III, p. xxxvi.)\nIn this case, it was laid down, among other things, that \"the owner of the soil\" (proprietor?) may sell or otherwise dispose of his interest without prejudice to the cultivator, \"and the cultivator vice versa.\" This is, of course, quite consistent with the existence of separate rights, but these are not necessarily confined to two persons, the possessor of the first proprietary right (whom, for convenience sake, I have hitherto called the proprietor) and the cultivator, but there may intervene any number of subordinate proprietary rights, one springing from within another.\n\nWhere a chief or royal favourite or some powerful individual or family has obtained a grant from the Raja, or has usurped the right of the Raja to levy tenths and taxes and to dispose of abandoned land, a relationship between this superior proprietor and the cultivator is established, which soon develops into a system of tenancy, which is not readily distinguishable from that just described. The tenant continues to be the proprietor of his holding on fixed tenure, subject to the customary terms, while the rights of the superior proprietor, be they the creation of the Raja, or inherited, or the result of usurpation, become, in course of time, so fixed and continuous as to favour the impression that they include ownership of the soil. The position, therefore, which the judgment in Abdullatif v. Mahomed Meera Lebe discusses as existing between \"the owner of the soil\" (see note at foot) and the cultivator, may be created either by the admission of a tenant by a proprietor already in possession or by the establishment of a proprietor over the heads of cultivators already in possession. In a Malay State, the exercise of the rights of the superior proprietor are liable to much fluctuation. The despotic power of the Raja in petty Asiatic States is, of course, fatal to anything like\n\n* With all deference, I conceive that the learned Recorder was in error in using the term \"owner of the soil.\" The first proprietor has really only a proprietary right (unless, in Malacca, he has purchased the freehold from the British Government), which depends upon continuous occupation and payment of tenths to the Raja or Government, but, of course, in a district where land is valuable, occupation is certain to be continuous and thus the first proprietor comes to be regarded as the \"owner of the soil.\"\nsecurity of rights of property* and everything depends upon the personal energy and family influence of the person who claims the superior rights. There will always be other candidates for royal favour who will seek to supplant him in his rights if they are profitable (the rights of minors are almost certain to be invaded in this way), and the cultivator is always anxious to be recognised as an independent proprietor. One man will make good his right to receive tenths from a whole district and to regard the cultivators as his tenants, while his successor may, perhaps, on some show of opposition, tacitly abandon all such claims and leave the cultivators to be recognised in course of time as separate proprietors. All this is quite inconsistent with any notion of \"ownership of the soil,\" though it is easy to see how a systematic and continuous exercise of proprietary rights would lead an English Court to assume that such ownership existed. I entirely repudiate the theory of \"ownership of the soil\" as incidental in any way to the Malay system of land-tenure, and all the evidence shows that the Dutch grantee in Malacca had simply the rights of a Malay *tuan tanah*, such a one as I have described as being put in by the Raja over the heads of the cultivators.\n\nThe right of the proprietor to require obedience from his tenants raises a new question\u2014the liability of the cultivator to forced labour.\n\n---\n\n* \"From the facts already adduced, regarding the state of landed tenures, it will have appeared that the proprietary right to the soil is unquestionably vested in the Sovereign. This principle is so universally established, and so frequently exercised, that it is almost superfluous to offer any proof of it. Such is the fluctuation of landed property from the operation of this principle that there is not, perhaps, all over the country, at the present day, ten jungs of land in the possession of the descendants of those who held them fifty, nay, thirty years ago. The actual effect of the principle is, indeed, even more violent than we should be led at first sight to argue. The descendants of those who, no great number of years ago, were in affluence, holding the highest employments of the State, and, consequently, important and valuable tracts of land, may now be seen not only not inheriting the possessions of their forefathers, but hardly enjoying the bare means of subsistence, and reduced to a level with the meanest of the people.\" CRAWFORD\u2014Report on Nature and Condition of Landed Tenures under the Native Government of Java. Quoted by RAFFLES: Minute on Administration of Java, p. 92.\nChapter VI.\n\nTHE LIABILITY OF THE CULTIVATOR TO FORCED SERVICE.\n\nIn a land regulation passed by the Governor in Council in the Straits Settlements for the Settlement of Malacca (IX of 1830), there occurs a clause which declares cultivators to be exempt from forced labour. This regulation, if it ever had the force of law, was repealed a few years afterwards, and none of the Land Acts now in force in the Straits approach the subject at all. Whether or not the liability to forced labour from which Malacca cultivators were declared to be exempt in 1830, still survives, though dormant, as one of the incidents of the local customary tenure, is not a question of much importance now, for there is little likelihood of any attempt being made to enforce it on a large scale in a British Colony. But it is clear that, if there had been no existing liability in 1830, there would have been no necessity for special exemption. A code of regulations for Penghulus, which the Dutch authorities were about to introduce in Malacca just before the cession in 1825, contains a clause requiring the Penghulu to keep all roads in order and to call on the tenants to repair them. This, too, assumes a pre-existing duty on the part of the tenants.\n\nMr. Fullerton, Governor of Penang and subsequently of the incorporated Settlements (1824 to 1830), recorded that, under the Dutch Government in Malacca, services were required and labour exacted, from the tenants; that they were, in short, kept in a state of vassalage and servitude quite inconsistent with the encouragement of cultivation.*\n\nThe cultivator or tenant, who was thus liable to be required to work for the Government or superior proprietor, was the holder of the proprietary right which has already been described. In Malay States, the liability still exists, and, for the complete understanding of the ra'iyat's position, it is necessary to ascertain, as nearly as possible, what is the extent of his liability to forced service, how far it is an incident of his\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 740.\ntenure of his land, what is the mode of enforcing obedience, and what is the penalty for contumacy. With the exception of the extract at the head of the preceding chapter, I have met with no passage in Malay laws which affects these questions; there is no written definition of the nature and extent of the services which a Raja or Chief or superior proprietor can exact from the cultivator. In a Malay State, the exaction of personal service from the ra'iyat is limited only by the powers of endurance of the latter. The superior authority is obliged, from self-interest, to stop short of the point at which oppression will compel the cultivator to abandon his land and emigrate. But within this limit, the cultivator may be required to give his labour in making roads, bridges, drains, and other works of public utility, to tend elephants, to pole boats, to carry letters and messages, to attend his Chief when travelling, to cultivate his Chief's fields as well as his own, and to serve as a soldier when required.* Local custom often regulates the kind of service exacted from the\n\n* **Raffles**, writing to Lord Minto in 1811 on the disadvantages of allowing Siamese influence to preponderate in Kedah, thus describes the status of the Siamese peasant:\u2014\u201cBoth persons and property are at the command of \u2018the King, and, of course, at the command of his Officers in recession from \u2018the lowest to the highest; hence no man will rear what he cannot call his \u2018own. Certain months are allowed the many to plant and reap their paddy: \u2018and this when stored is sacred and cannot be taken from their possession; \u2018with this exception all the rest of their time, exertions, or acquirements \u2018may be taken by the King or his Officers if so inclined.\u201d *Life of Raffles*, p. 52.\n\nThe Burman seems to be little better off:\u2014\n\n\u201cCorv\u00e9es and enforced duties of all kinds are frequent, and the men \u201cselected for such service can only get off by furnishing a substitute or \u201cbribing the tithing-man. The King or some great man wants to build \u201ca pagoda, and orders are sent round to the various circles that they must \u201cfurnish a regular supply of workers daily. The *taik* or *myo-thoo-gyee* \u201cdraws up a roster, and each man has to go to work for a certain number \u201cof days. If he fail to go, he is tied up to a post or a tree and gets a \u201csound flogging. Similar forced duties are the protection of the frontier \u201cand the pursuit of dacoits. Such work is particularly detested, for the \u201cmen have to keep themselves supplied with food, or get their friends to \u201cbring it to them, and this is not always an easy matter. Besides, such \u201cservice may last an indefinite time.\u201d *The Burman, his Life and Notions*, 1882, II, 262.\ncultivator in a particular district. Thus in Perak one district used to supply the Raja with timber for building purposes, while rattans and other materials came from others; the people of one locality used to furnish the musicians for the Raja's band, while another had to provide nurses and attendants for his children.* Speaking of Kedah, Colonel Low says: \"The ryot was obliged also to pay for keeping up bands of music and state elephants. His children were liable to be forcibly taken from him\u2014the girls for the seraglio, and the youths for public works or for war, where they got no pay and but precarious supplies of food.\"\u2020\n\nTennent describes \"feudal service\" as prevailing in its amplest details in the Eastern Province of Ceylon. \"According to the custom of the country, the chief of the district directs its cultivation by the villagers; they acknowledge his authority, and, so long as they live on the land, devote their whole time and labour to his service, receiving in return a division of the grain, a share of the milk from his cattle, and the certainty of support in periods of famine and distress. Their houses, gardens and wells, though built, planted and dug by themselves, are the property of the Chief, who alone can dispose of them.\"\n\n* * *\n\n\"These serfs, whilst they live on the land, are bound to perform every service for the lord of the soil, without pay; they fence his gardens, cover his houses, carry his baggage, perform the work of coolies in balams (canoes), fish for him, act as his messengers; and when absent from his village, they must provide food for himself and servants.

In the transportation of public property, or the conveyance of the minions of the court or its officers, in the repair or construction of roads, bridges, and other public works, the services of the people are exacted unmercifully, and without thanks or reward.\" Crawfurd\u2014Hist.

But as they seldom do change, it may safely be presumed that they are contented with the arrangement, and their healthy and pleasant faces sufficiently prove that they are well-fed and happy.\"*\n\nForced service in a Malay State, too, is not merely the result of the application of the law of the stronger; it is well understood to be an incident of the lot of the cultivator of land, he acquiesces in it as one of the conditions on which he holds his fields, and he usually submits quietly to the orders of his superiors until they reach the pitch of oppression at which he decides that emigration is preferable to slavery. He knows that, by emigrating, he will forfeit his land, and in fact it is at once seized by the Penghulu and held for the Raja.\n\nThe cultivator may perhaps receive forgiveness and the restitution of his fields if he returns and submits at some later time, but he will probably have to pay a fine if he is known to possess the means of doing so.\n\nNo incident of native rule has contributed so much to swell the Malay population of Penang and Province Wellesley as this. Kedah has been half denuded of its inhabitants, and Patani, Perlis, Situl, Trang, etc., have contributed numbers of emigrants anxious to escape the unjust exactions of native rulers. But when the system is worked with justice and moderation, there are seldom complaints from the people. In the Krian district of Perak, the people (many of them British subjects), under the orders of the Orang Kaya Mantri, made roads and canals without murmuring, and in the same district, after its cession to the British Government, there was no difficulty in turning out nearly a thousand men in 1874, to commence clearing a line through the forest for a proposed road.\u2020\n\nThe kerah, or forced levy of men for labour, is effected through the headmen of villages or districts. A Penghulu receives the orders of his Chief or Raja to have a certain number of men ready at a given time or place, and runs a risk of\n\n* Tennent's Ceylon, II, 459.\n\u2020 Government Gazette, Feb. 6th, 1875.\npunishment or disgrace if he does not do so. He fines those who disobey, and takes money from those who are able to purchase exemption, so he contrives usually to make the incident profitable to himself. The cultivator who has to leave his house and his fields at this bidding, has to find his own tools and food, which may involve the carrying of a heavy load to the place of work, and a good deal of expense or privation. The abolition of the cultivator's liability for personal service in Java* was one of the facts which Raffles took into consideration in deciding what proportion of his crop the cultivator should pay to the State by way of land-revenue.\u2020 That enlightened administrator was very far from thinking that forced service, as one of the incidents of native tenure, was to be abolished simply, without any consideration given to Government for the concession. It was never for a moment doubted that the right of the Government to exact personal service from the cultivator was inherent in the system under which he held his lands, and the same holds good in Malay countries also. The right of a Malay Raja or Chief to order his feudal inferior to perform reasonable services is indisputable, and the surrender of such a right is a perfectly legitimate consideration for demanding an enhanced land revenue or other equivalent.\n\n* \"The system of vassalage and forced deliveries has been abolished generally throughout the Island.\" Proclamation by Lieut.-Governor of Java, October 15th, 1813.\n\n\u2020 \"On mature consideration, and the best advice within my reach, I conceived that a fair equivalent for them, including the acknowledged Government share of the crop, the amount paid in personal taxes and on the internal trade, and the value of forced services, might be found, one district with another, in establishing the Government share, at about two-fifths of the rice-crop, leaving the second crop and the fruit-trees and gardens attached to the villages, free from assessment, the cultivator free from personal taxes, and the inland trade unrestricted and untaxed.\" RAFFLES' Minute on Java, 137.\n\n\"The peasant was subject to gross oppression and undefined exaction; our object was to remove his oppressor, and to limit demand to a fixed and reasonable rate of contribution. He was liable to restraints on the freedom of inland trade, to personal services and forced contingents: our object was to commute them all for a fixed and well-known contribution.\" History of Java, I, 154.\nWith the kerah system as practised in Malay States, it is interesting to compare the state of things which the English found in Java seventy years ago. A Dutch Commissioner, reporting on the province of Sourabaya in 1812, wrote as follows:\n\n\"The feudal service was as grievous as almost all the other charges united. The origin of those services must be sought for in the feudal system of the native Government long ago adopted throughout Java. It was considered that all the land was the property of the prince, who only made provisional assignments thereof to his subjects, in remuneration for military and other services rendered. This was the cause of all the lands being divided into as many allotments as could be cultivated, called chachas, each of a size to be cultivated by one man. A certain number of these was assigned to the different chiefs, according to his rank; the custom of the country fixing not only the amount of contributions to be paid from the produce, but the number of men to be constantly kept in attendance upon him. The lands thus assigned to chiefs were exempt from service to them, and the inhabitants were only expected to watch the villages, to make and repair the roads, and to perform other general services of the State. This was the situation of the people with regard to service, when the coast districts were first ceded to the European Government. The system of trade and fixed contributions did not admit of any change, and the services were at that time of very little consequence, and such as could be performed without oppression to the inhabitants; but the case is now quite different. Successively, and particularly of late years, much heavier services have been demanded than were ever before known, and it naturally follows, that the Javan must be kept more at work than before. Besides, it is not possible to apportion those services equally, on account of the situation of the places where the services are required, and because the chiefs, who have the direction of the works, from indifference or laziness, generally make a requisition on the nearest village; and it not unfrequently happens, that many people are thus taken for the public service, who have no lands whatever allotted to them.\"\n\"Were the requisitions made for the public service alone, \"it would still be comparatively nothing, it being admitted \"that the State has a right to the labour of its subjects, but \"the Regents, their relations, their Patehs, and the subordi- \"nate Chiefs of every description, assume the right of disposing \"of the services of the common people as they think proper, \"and themselves employ many of them in menial labour of all \"descriptions, from which it arises that the number of people \"employed away from their houses on what is called public \"services is almost incredible.\"\n\nForced labour is naturally hated by Malays and is evaded as much as possible. Travelling in the interior of Kedah, I have seen the Malay peasant running from his fields into the jungle at the sight of the Raja's elephants, lest he should be called upon to form one of the train. In Perak, the establishment of British influence has led to a general \"strike\" on the part of the peasantry against the system to which they formerly submitted peacefully. A Malay Raja in Perak, who in 1876 was able to supply me with the men of two or three villages in order to convey the baggage and stores of a detachment of troops from Blanja to Kinta, now finds it difficult to procure men to pole his own boat without paying them. Men required to perform work for the Government of the State, as at present constituted, are scrupulously paid, or provided with ample rations. In Malacca, the corv\u00e9e system has never been exercised under British rule, though it is, no doubt, an incident of native tenure, and, unless surrendered by Government for a money equivalent, might very reasonably be exacted for such purely local objects as repairing the dams and other native irrigation works which are necessary for the successful cultivation of the fields of a village or district,* building a balei\n\n* Compulsory labour was formerly an institution in Ceylon also:\u2014\"Another institution to the influence and operation of which the country was indebted for the construction of the works which diffused plenty throughout every region, was the system of Raja-kariya, by which the King had a right to employ, for public purposes, the compulsory labour of the inhabitants. To what extent this was capable of exaction, or under what safeguards it was enforced in early times, does not appear from the historical books. But on all occasions when tanks were to be formed or canals cut for irrigation, the Mahawanso alludes almost in words of course\u2014to the application of Raja-kariya for their construction, the people being summoned to the task by beat of drum.\" TENNENT'S Ceylon, I, 427.\nor place of business for the use of the headman and elders of\nthe village, keeping pathways clear of jungle, etc., etc.*\nBut no words can be too strong to condemn the exactions\nof Malay Rajas, Chiefs and their followers in respect of\nthe family and personal property of the cultivator, which may\naffect any of his possessions, from his daughter to the vegeta-\nbles growing in his garden.\u2020 The goats, fowls, fruit, crops, etc.,\nof the unfortunate peasant whose hut and land are on the route\nfollowed by a Raja on his journey, are, under a native Govern-\nment, at the mercy of his rapacious followers; gajah lalu\norang buat layu, \"the elephant passes by, but men bring\n\n* So, in England, the oath of fealty is still an incident of the tenure of cer-\ntain estates in land, though seldom or never exacted in practice.\n\n\u2020 \"The proprietors of the pusakas have also a claim to the services of the cul-\ntivators; a certain number of them are always in attendance at the houses\nof their Chiefs, and on journeys are employed in carrying their persons and\nbaggage. The lands not pusaka used to pay the same proportion of produce\nto the Sultan as the others did to the proprietors; but the cultivators of the\nroyal dominions laboured under greater disadvantages than the others.\nEvery Chief or favourite about Court had authority to employ them in the\nmost menial offices, and Chiefs possessing pusakas often spared their own\npeople, and employed the others.

I\ncannot but consider the greatest of these\u2014the extent of the personal service\ndemanded not only by the Tumunggong and his family, but the Mantris and\nall the petty Chiefs, who had trains of followers that received no stipendiary\nrecompense. These added to the individuals employed in the coffee-planta-\ntions (to which they appear peculiarly averse), in beating out rice for the\ncontingent, in cutting grass for and attending the jayang sekars (native\nmilitia), post carriage and letter-carriers, may be calculated to have em-\nployed one-fifth of the male population of the working men. Another great\nsource of exaction was the large unwieldy establishment of jayang sekars,\nand police officers; the former were liberally paid, the latter had no regular\nemoluments. Both these classes, however, quartered themselves freely in\nwhatever part of the country their functions demanded their attendance.\nThis was equally the case with any of the Regent's family or petty Chiefs\nwho travelled for pleasure or on duty. Whatever was required for themselves\nand their followers, was taken from the poor inhabitants who have now been\nso long accustomed to such practices that they never dare to complain or to\nremonstrate. The European authority did not escape the taint of corruption.\nMonopolies, unpaid services, licences, forced or at least expected presents,\nwere but too common even in the best times, and must have contributed to\nestrangle the affections and respect of the natives from that power which\nshould have afforded them protection.\" Report on Pasuruan\u2014Id.\na blight,\" is a significant saying in Perak and sufficiently denotes the effect of royal progresses from the villager's point of view. The practice of the Malay peasant, which must be well known to British officials who have worked in Malay districts, of bringing some simple offering, such as a fowl or two, or a basket of fruit or vegetables, when he presents himself before his superior with some request or application, has its origin in this custom. Such a present is expected in a State under native Government, and a man has small chance of a favourable hearing who comes empty-handed. It is satisfactory to observe the gradual disappearance of the practice of offering such presents, however trifling, for it is a testimony of the general acceptance by the people of the fact that, far from being expected or exacted, they are not even accepted under British administration.\n\nBefore quitting the subject of forced service, it may be useful to notice that Sir Stamford Raffles maintained the right of the renters of Government estates to require the cultivators to perform certain duties, but he stipulated that in such case they should be paid. The following paragraph occurs in his minute of June 14th, 1813:\n\n\"It will necessarily form a part of the arrangement to be concluded, that the renters shall engage to keep the roads and bridges in repair (with the exception of the great military road) and also to furnish labourers, carriages, etc., when required for the public service; but I propose that, on these occasions, the persons so furnished be regularly paid for, at the rate to be established in the leases of each district. This arrangement is, indeed, absolutely necessary if it were only to place in the hands of Government the means of checking the employment of people, on the various pretexts of official establishment, on the public service. At present there exists no check; and as the people so furnished by the Regents, under the existing system, ought to be paid by a proportion of land, it follows either that they are not paid for their labour, or that the Regent is obliged to give up to them a portion of that land, from which he would derive a revenue, and for which, it is naturally to be expected, he will make a proportionate exaction elsewhere. As the whole lands will now be rented\n\"indiscriminately, this fund ceases, and the additional land thus\nto be rented, instead of furnishing a fund for the payment of\npersons employed in the public service, will provide the source\nof Revenue from whence such persons will be paid, while the\nexamination of the public disbursements will effectually pre-\nvent unauthorised employment of individuals on the public\naccount.\"\n\nIn Java, it would appear from the following extract,* the\nDutch Government proceeds on the principle of requiring that\nall labour which may be legally exacted should be paid for in\nfull:\n\n\"Forced Labour.\u2014Besides the ordinary day labourers, the\nlandlord, whether Government or a private land-owner, is fur-\nther entitled to require the cottiers on his estate to work for\nhim as much as he pleases, but only on the condition of paying\neach man the highest agricultural wages of the district. This\nis the only real forced labour in Java, and the only point on\nwhich the land-owner there has any but a strictly limited power\nover the cottier peasantry on his estate. The labour rent\u2020\nextending all over the island causes no perceptible dissatisfac-\ntion, but the forced labour beyond the one-tenth excites bitter\nfeelings if persisted in. Both the labour rent and the forced\nlabour are applied, on private estates, to the cultivation of\nthose crops which the landowner is growing on the spare land\nfor his own profit, except so much of the labour as is required\nfor the gardos, and for the maintenance of the roads near the\nestate, both which the landlords have to keep up from the\nlabour rent.\"\n\n\"The cottier peasant is carefully guarded from extortion by\nhis landlord, but bound to pay his landlord's share of the pro-\nduce of the land; his subordinate rights in his holding are\nprotected, but kept subject to his landlord's paramount right\nto the soil; and he is practically freed from oppression, though\nsubject to have his labour utilized by his landlord. By these\nmeans the cottier tenant's interests are secured, and he soon\nbecomes rich, from the large surplus produce of his holding\nafter paying his landlord's one-fifth. By the same provisions\n\n* Money's Java, II, 219.\n\u2020 The obligation of the peasant to give one day's gratuitous work in seven.\nthe land-owner is invested with sufficient power over his whole estate to enable him to turn the remainder of his land to the most profitable use it is fitted for. After having thus carefully regulated the respective rights of landlord and tenant, the Dutch are wise enough to abstain from further interference, beyond seeing that the legal conditions are fulfilled. If a land-owner chooses to exact forced labour from his cottiers, and thereby to create discontent among them, the Dutch officials do not envenom this feeling by issuing injudicious proclamations of abstract rights for the cottiers, or of remonstrance with the land-owner. They take care that the land-owner complies with the law, by paying the highest agricultural wages for such forced labour, and they meet the peasant\u2019s complaint by saying that the land-owner is only exercising his right, in a manner of which he is sole judge, and that the cottiers must either submit or withdraw from the estate.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter VIII.\n\nTRANSFER BY SALE AND MORTGAGE.\n\n\"Land,\" says Marsden, \"is so abundant in proportion to the population, that they (the Malays of Sumatra) scarcely consider it as the subject of right, any more than the elements of air and water; excepting so far as in speculation the prince lays claim to the whole. The ground, however, on which a man plants or builds, with the consent of his neighbours, becomes a species of nominal property, and is transferable;*\n\n* In Burma \"all owners exercise the right of sale, lease, gift and mortgage, though sale outright is very seldom made. There appears to be an objection to it, which may almost be called religious, irrespective of the rights of heirs, which cannot be alienated; and when land is sold by deed, it is generally expressed that the object of the purchaser is to build a pagoda or other religious edifice thereon. This is supposed to justify the sale. Rice land is occasionally let from year to year on verbal agreement, the tenant agreeing to pay ten per cent. of the produce.\" Sir Arthur Phayre, before the Society of Arts, May, 1881.\nbut as it costs him nothing, beside his labour, it is only the produce which is esteemed of value, and the compensation he receives is for this alone. A temporary usufruct is accordingly all that they attend to, and the price, in case of sale, is generally ascertained by the cocoa-nut, durian, and other fruit-trees that have been planted on it; the buildings being for the most part, but little durable. Whilst any of these subsist, the descendants of the planter may claim the ground, though it has been for years abandoned. If they are cut down, he may recover damages; but if they have disappeared in the course of nature the land reverts to the public.*\n\n\"In Celebes, in Bali, and in that ill-peopled portion of Java called the country of the Sundas, the cultivator is invested with a kind of proprietary right. By sufferance he can bequeath, alienate, or mortgage his little tenement.\"\u2020\n\nAmong them (the Sundanese), private property in the soil is generally established; the cultivator can transmit his possession to his children. Among them it can be sub-divided without any interference on the part of a superior; the possessor can sell his interest in it to others, and transfer it by gift or covenant. He pays to his Chief a certain proportion of the produce, in the same manner as the other inhabitants of Java; because in a country without trade or manufactures, labour or produce is the only shape in which he can contribute to support the necessary establishments of the community. So long as he advances this tribute, which is one-tenth or one-fifth of the gross produce, he has an independent right to the occupancy of his land and the enjoyment of the remainder.\"\n\n* History of Sumatra, 244.\n\u2020 Crawfurd\u2014Hist. Ind. Arch., III, 53.\nown soil, what is only the average recompense of labour expended on the estate of another.\"*\n\nIn the first of the above extracts, Marsden, with his usual accuracy, describes the chief incidents of the land tenure of the Malays, as they exist among the people of the Peninsula as well as among those of Sumatra; and it is subsequently shewn that among the Sundanese in the west of Java\u2014a people who in their customs and language bear a much nearer resemblance to the Malays than do the people of any other part of Java\u2014those incidents which have relation to the alienation of land are almost identical with those which obtain among the Malays. I am inclined to think that the superior permanency of the tenure of the Sundanese, when compared with that of the Javanese, is to be accounted for by a Malay origin, and that it is unnecessary to argue, with Raffles, that it is a mere survival in a remote district of a more liberal system, which once prevailed generally in the island, but which was destroyed by the rapacity of Muhammadan sovereigns. Malays, too, have had for centuries Muhammadan Rajas, not less given to encroachment upon the rights of individuals than those of Java; yet the Malay peasant has retained his proprietary right, and I believe that, both in Malay countries and in Sunda, this has been due to a national feeling or instinct on this subject, not to be found among the Javanese, who, under native rule, were serfs without proprietary interest in the land which they cultivated.\n\nThe power of alienation is one of the most important privileges connected with land that a land-holder can exercise, but it is only the result of an advanced and liberal recognition on the part of the governing power, of the rights of the subject. It must not be forgotten that, even in England, it was not until the Statute of Quia emptores was passed, in the reign of Edward I, that tenants in fee simple obtained the right of alienating their lands at their pleasure, and that the right of devising lands by will only dates from the reign of Henry VIII.\u2020\n\n* Raffles\u2014History of Java, I, 140.\n\u2020 \"We are too apt to forget that property in land as a transferable, marketable commodity, absolutely owned and passing from hand to hand like any chattel, is not an ancient institution, but a modern development reached only in a few very advanced countries. In the greater part of the world,\nIt is not to be expected that among the Malays the system of alienation, or the effect of a transfer, should quite correspond with any European system, and it is necessary to be cautious in supposing that when land in a Malay State is said to have been bought or sold, the transaction has been similar to the purchase or sale of land in British territory, either in the mode in which it has been conducted, or in its practical operation. Crawfurd, it will have been noticed, says that the Sundanese cultivator is allowed to alienate his land \"by sufferance;\" and Marsden points out that the usufruct is all that a Malay has and all that he can dispose of.\n\nWhen Captain Low, in describing land tenure in Kedah, says that land granted by the Raja \"could not be alienated\" * it must not be supposed that the right of occupancy could not in general be the subject of a bargain there. Captain Low quotes extracts from the Undang-Undang Kedah (Laws of Kedah) in which occur the two following sections:\n\n\"When a garden is to be sold, the trees are to be estimated at \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a dollar each and the amount will be the price of the land.\"\n\n\"What the Raja has given no one can take away, nor can any one sell land so given without the Raja's concurrence.\" \u2020\n\nThe first of these rules exactly coincides with what Marsden describes, as regards the interest in the land which passes by sale in Sumatra, and with Raffles' estimate of what the Sundanese peasant has a right to expect on the surrender of his\n\n---\n\n*See supra, p. 79.\n\n\u2020 Powerful as the Zamindar became in managing the land, in grasping and in ousting, he had no power (in Bengal before 1793) of alienating his estate; he could not raise money on it by mortgage, nor sell the whole or any part of it. This clearly appears from a proclamation issued on 1st August, 1786; the illegal practice of 'alienating revenue lands' is complained of; 'the gentlemen appointed to superintend' the various districts are invited zealously to prevent the 'commission of the offence;' and the Zamindar, Chaudhari, Tulugdar, or other land-holder who disobeys, is threatened with dispossession from his lands.\" Land Revenue and Land Tenures of India.\u2014Baden-Powell, p. 221.\nproprietary right to a transferee. It may be clearly laid down that the Malay cultivator can transfer only the interest in the land which he himself possesses; that that interest, as already shewn, is merely a permanent and inheritable right of occupation, conditional on the continuous occupation of the land on the payment of tenths and taxes, and on the rendering of certain customary services; and that the price to be paid has no reference to the value of the land itself (for, in a primitive state of society, that has little intrinsic value), but is calculated, if garden land, by estimating the value of the fruit-trees, or, if padi land, by assessing at a reasonable sum the probable value of the labour bestowed by the first cultivator in clearing the forest and bringing the field into cultivation.\n\nI have had opportunities of observing the Malay customs relating to the sale and mortgage of land in operation in purely native districts, having been deputed in 1874 to take over the territory on the left bank of the Krian river, then recently ceded by Perak to the British Government, and having since then served for some years as Assistant Resident in the Native State of Perak. I am, therefore, able to speak with some confidence upon the laws and customs which have come under my personal observation in actual practice.\n\nThe technical term used in Perak for the transfer of land by sale is pulang b\u0113lanja (return of expenses), which sufficiently indicates that the money paid is not a price set upon the land itself, but the recoupment of the outlay incurred by the vendor in bringing it into cultivation. The new proprietor, in fact, does not buy the land; he simply buys out the occupier by compensating him for his labour, that being the factor which originally created the tenancy, and thus obtains the right to stand in his place. It is manifest that he will not pay a long price for a mere right of occupancy weighted by the incidents and liabilities above described; in Krian, in 1874, it was difficult to get ten dollars an orlong for excellent padi land by pulang b\u0113lanja, but when security of tenure and the full right of alienation of the soil were introduced in the district by the British Government, it became possible to sell the same land for $60 or $70 an orlong.\n\nSo in the case of land on which fruit-trees are growing.\nNot long after the Perak war it became necessary to acquire the piece of land at Kuala Kangsa, in Perak, on which the British Residency now stands. The bargain was effected in strict accordance with Malay law, and the sum which was paid was calculated as the value of the fruit-trees and houses standing on the land. It was clearly understood on both sides that the soil was vested in the State, and that all that the proprietor could dispose of was the proprietary right; the transaction was strictly one of pulang b\u00e9lanja. Speaking of this purchase to Raja Muda Yusuf at Sayong soon afterwards, I was asked by him in a pointed manner whether the late proprietor had sold me the land; the explanation that the proprietor had merely been compensated for her interest in the land, namely, her trees and houses, quite satisfied him and others that Malay custom had been observed, and that the rights of the Raja or State had not been invaded by an undue claim, on the part of a subject, to the soil. This principle has always been recognised in all sales of land in Malay districts in Perak which have come under my notice. But the Malay cultivator is always ready to claim from British officers, whom he may think likely to be ignorant of the real conditions of native land tenure, a larger interest than Malay law gives him, in fact, as large an interest as can be conceded. The official who hears the words \"sell\" (jual) and \"buy\" (b\u00e9li) used in connection with the transfer of land under native tenure, is apt to conclude that a title to the soil has been passed by the transaction, and he very possibly recognises, or allows to be recognised in a general way, this view of the matter, and so people get to believe, or are allowed to assert, that their position in respect to the State is something quite different from what it really is. This, though it may cause embarrassment in administering the land-revenue of a district, cannot, of course, affect the legal status of the cultivator, for ignorant administration of the law does not alter the law itself. Nothing can be more certain than the fact that no subject in a Malay State can lawfully claim to hold any property in land approaching our freehold or fee simple tenure.\n\nAs the Malay pulang b\u00e9lanja differs widely from our idea of a sale of land, so the jual janji (conditional sale), the only\nform of hypothecation of land known to Malay law, is, in its principal incidents, quite unlike our mortgage of real property.*\n\nThe Malay who raises money on his holding by the transaction called *jual janji*, sells his proprietary right for a sum then and there advanced to him, and surrenders the land to the vendee, coupling, however, the transfer with the condition that if, at any time, or within a certain time, he shall repay to the vendee the sum so advanced, he (the vendor) shall be entitled to take back his land. This transaction differs from our mortgage in the facts:\u2014(1) that no property in the soil passes, but merely the proprietary right; (2) that possession is actually given to the person who advances the money.\n\nIt frequently happens that the conditional vendor (the debtor) wishes to retain possession of the land during the period of his indebtedness, and, if so, this is arranged by his becoming the tenant of the conditional vendee (the creditor). The rent in money or kind which he pays, or which some other tenant pays if the land is not let to the conditional vendor, or the profit which the conditional vendee derives from cultivating the land himself if he does not let it, takes the place of interest, which is not charged, usury being condemned by Muhammadan law.\n\nIf a term is mentioned within which the money must be repaid, and the condition of repayment is not fulfilled within the appointed period, the sale becomes absolute (*putus*) and the vendee takes the full rights of proprietorship. But even\n\n*In China, \"a mortgagee must actually enter into possession of the property and make himself personally responsible for the payment of the taxes, before his mortgage is valid: unless explicitly stated, the land can be deemed at any time within thirty years on payment of the original sum. Secs. 90 to 100 of the Code contain the laws relating to this subject, some of which bear a resemblance to those established among the Hebrews and intended to secure a similar object of retaining the land in the same class or tribe.\"\u2014*The Middle Kingdom*, WILLIAMS, II, 100.\n\n\"Land under Burman rule was never sold in the usual acceptation of the term. It was frequently conveyed for a price from one person to another, and though the transaction was styled a sale, and not a mortgage, it was fully understood that the vendor retained a right to repurchase the land at any time he liked, and that the emptor could not re-sell the land without the consent of the original vendor.\"\u2014*British Burma Gazetteer*, Vol. I, p.438\nthen the payment of the money at some later time would, in most cases, be sufficient to enable the conditional vendor to regain his land from a stranger under purely native rule. If no term is fixed, the money may be paid at any time, but until it is paid, the conditional vendee is entitled to retain possession of the land and to cultivate it, or let it, at his pleasure. A short document is generally drawn up in evidence of the transaction, but these are often so loosely or informally worded that the proof of the existence of the condition rests principally upon the good faith of the parties. Sometimes there is no written agreement at all.\n\nTransactions of this nature necessarily led to the investigations of many disputed claims when the rights of the native land-holders in Krian were being settled (see supra, p. 121). The rise in the value of land occasioned by the establishment of British rule resulted in a general rush for possession, men who had long since sold their fields by pulang b\u0113lanja coming forward to declare that the sale was merely conditional, while in other instances conditional vendees in possession were equally ready to declare that the transaction which gave them their right was jual putus, an absolute sale, not jual janji, a conditional one.\n\nThe native laws contain some curious provisions on the subject of hypothecation, a specimen of which relating to real property may be consulted in the Appendix, p. xv. In all, the peculiar principle of the Malay mortgage, namely, the handing over to the creditor of the property on which the money is advanced, is fully recognised.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter VIII.**\n\n**Inheritance.**\n\nAmong the Malays, the distribution of the property of deceased persons is governed either by Muhammadan law, or by national custom, or partly by one and partly by the other,\ne.g., the real property by customary law and the personal property by Muhammadan law.\n\nThere are Malay treatises on the Muhammadan law of inheritance (*faraiz*), in accordance with the rules of which it is common to apportion the estate of an intestate. But there are reasons which often make it clear to the Malay mind that land is a species of property, the transmission of which should be in accordance with the national customary law (*hukum adat*) rather than with that of the Koran (*hukum shar'a*). For instance, the wife of a Malay cultivator will generally share in the toil of cultivation; indeed the planting and reaping of paddy is performed almost entirely by women, although the ploughing and harrowing fall to the lot of the men. In respect, therefore, of the crop, which is harvested as the result of these joint labours, the husband and wife are co-partners (*sharikat*) and this is often the case with regard to the land itself. Under such circumstances, in case of the death of the husband, it would be manifestly unjust to distribute the joint property as his estate under Muhammadan law. The joint property must be equally divided, and the share of the wife having been allotted to her, the share of the deceased husband may, if desired, be distributed in accordance with the Muhammadan law of inheritance. This is only the rightful due of the wife, who, properly speaking, is entitled to be maintained by her husband in a manner befitting his station in life without performing any labour.\n\nI think that it will be generally found that, in the Malay States, the property of the trading class\u2014goods, merchandise, shops, ships, &c.\u2014are distributed according to Muhammadan law, while the agricultural class cling with tenacity to their old customs, and insist that their lands at least, and often the whole of their property, shall descend in accordance with the old Malay law which has come down to them from their forefathers.\n\nThis customary law varies very much according to locality, individual States having often regulations peculiar to them alone.\n\n*\u0641\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0636*, plural of *\u0641\u0631\u0636\u0647*, from *\u0641\u0631\u0636* to cut. (Arabic.)\nCRAWFURD mentions the subject very briefly:\u2014\u201cWhere there is a right of private property in land, or at least the usufruct of it, there is generally a community of goods among the members of a family. It is held in the name of the father or elder male of the family, and hence, by the customs of the greater number of the tribes, the father, or nearest of kin, is answerable for the debts of all the members of a family. I can nowhere discover in any of the collections of native laws which have fallen into my hands, that the right of devising property by will had any existence among the tribes of the Indian Islands.\u201d*\n\nThis recognition of a superior right in the eldest male of a family and the tendency of the Malays to confine the right of succession to land to the tribe to which the deceased owner belonged, is found in the law of the Chinese also: \u201cThe paternal estate and the houses upon it descend to the eldest son, but his brothers can remain upon it with their families, and devise their portion in perpetuo to their children, or an amicable composition can be made; daughters never inherit, nor can an adopted son of another clan succeed.\u201d\u2020\n\nMARSDEN, writing of the law of inheritance among the people of Pasummah in Sumatra, says:\u2014\n\n\u201cIf a person dies having children, these inherit his effects in equal portions and become answerable for the debts of the deceased. If any of his brothers survive, they may be permitted to share with their nephews, but rather as a matter of courtesy than right and only when the effects of the deceased devolved to him from his father or grandfather. If he was a man of rank, it is common for the son who succeeds him in title to have a larger share. This succession is not confined to the eldest born, but depends much on private agreement in the family. If the deceased person leaves no kindred behind him, the tribe to which he belonged shall inherit his effects and be answerable for his debts.\u201d\u2021\n\n* CRAWFURD\u2014Hist. Ind. Arch., III, 98.\n\u2020 WILLIAMS\u2014The Middle Kingdom, II, 100.\n\u2021 Hist. of Sumatra, p. 230, (3rd Ed.).\nAccording to the Menangkabau law of inheritance, the nephew on the sister's side becomes heir to his uncle's property to the exclusion of the son of the latter. The tradition which accounts for this singular regulation is to be found in Newbold's work on the Straits of Malacca, vol. II, p. 221. A similar custom prevails in the Eastern Province of Ceylon and in parts of India, and there is a Sinhalese legend, not unlike the Malay one, explanatory of its origin.* This custom is still observed in the district of Naning in the interior of Malacca, and in Rambau, Sungei Ujong and the Negri Sambilan.\n\nThe Perak custom differs from this. In that State the lands and houses of the deceased descend to his daughters equally, while the sons divide the personal property. The latter are supposed to be able to create landed estates for themselves, by clearing and planting land which they may select, or, at all events, to obtain the use of land by marrying women who may have inherited it.\n\nHowever, the more active of the Muhammadan priests and mosque officials, especially if they be foreigners and not Perak Malays, endeavour, as far as they can, to get the Muhammadan law of inheritance adopted, to the exclusion of the local custom. The older men are more conservative. From information supplied by an old Imam up the country, I learn that the principle of distribution practised in his district is as follows:\n\n\"If a man dies without children, leaving a widow, his property is divided between her and the waris of the deceased. If he leaves a wife and children, the property is, in the first instance, divided into two equal shares, one of which goes to the waris of the deceased and the other is again sub-divided into four parts, one of which (one-eighth of the whole) goes to the widow and the other three (three-eighths) are divided among the children.\"\n\n\"If there are children of both sexes, the three-eighths above-mentioned are divided into four portions, of which three go\n\n* Tennent's Ceylon, II, 458.\n\"to the son or sons, and the remaining one to the daughter or \"daughters.\"\n\nIt will be apparent that there is very little genuine Muhammadan law in all this. Under that system, the widow does not get a half under any circumstances. It is not clear who are the waris, or heirs, who take one-half of an estate to the exclusion of the widow and children. Perhaps it is meant that one-half is set apart in the first place to meet funeral expenses and the claims of persons entitled to share under Muhammadan law, among whom the children would be included. The same authority has supplied me with the following note on the customary law of inheritance practised in parts of Perak:\n\n\"Upon the death of a man possessed of property, his plantations, houses and padi-fields go to his daughters, while his other property, such as cattle, buffaloes, goats, elephants, &c., are divided into four shares: three of these go to the sons and the fourth is devoted to the cost of the funeral feasts. If there is no land or house, the daughters share in the personal property equally with the sons.\"\n\n\"If a woman who has inherited land or house property marries and then dies without leaving a child, the property goes to her waris and not to her husband. If she leaves issue, the inheritance goes to the child or children.\"\n\n\"Property which has been acquired by the joint earnings of the husband and wife must, upon the death of either of them, be divided. The funeral expenses must be deducted before division. The remainder must be divided equally in two shares, one of which goes to the survivor and the other to the children or waris of the deceased.\"\n\n\"The shares of infant children are held in trust for them by the waris of a deceased parent, until they come of age.\"\n\nThe descent of landed property in Perak to the female issue and its restitution to the family if an heiress dies childless, illustrate in a striking manner the tribal instinct of the Malays and the tendency to keep property in a particular family, group or tribe.\n\nEven the wild tribes of the Peninsula have their rules of inheritance. Favre, writing of the Jakuns, says: \"After the\n\"death of parents the whole of their property will be divided amongst all the children in equal parts.\" *\n\nIn Siam, according to Colonel Low, \u2020 \"the property of an intestate person, should he leave no legal heirs, escheats to the King, who generally contrives to get a portion of the estate of every person deceased. Wills are written or made verbally, in the presence of competent witnesses; and may not be confounded with alienation by gift. Real and personal property may be willed and gifted away to any one, and, as hereditaments, descend to, and are without distinction divided amongst, the heirs at law. The laws of inheritance are considered as applying chiefly to heads of families. Under this view, the property of a man deceased is divided into three portions. One goes to the parents and grand parents, one to the widow, and the third to the children and other relations on the man's side according to priority. But should the man not have cohabited so long as three years with his wife, she will only receive one-third of a portion or part.\"\n\n\"The distribution of the property takes effect after the solemnization of the obsequies; and should a claimant, having the power and opportunity so to do, neglect to put in his claim previous to the termination of the obsequies, he forfeits his right.\"\n\n\"A person claiming inheritance must personally appear; substitutes being inadmissible. Heirs to property must assist at and bear their share of the charge for obsequies, exceptions being made for those who cannot, from the nature of circumstances, be present.\"\n\n\"Before property is divided, the debts of the deceased are to be punctually paid, and competent witnesses must be present at the division. It does not appear that any distinction is drawn betwixt property of which a female may be possessed, and that left by a man: both are divided on similar principles. The eldest child, whether male or female, gets the largest share. Should the individual have no parents,\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 269.\n\u2020 Id., I, 344.\ngrandparents or great-grandparents living, then the portion,\nor one-third of the real and personal property which such\npersons would have otherwise taken is divided equally and\nadded to the two remaining portions, the form of first sepa-\nrating the estate into three parts being always adhered to.\nThe same principle regulates the division where there are no\nclaimants to either of the other two shares.\"\n\nWith this description, and with the customs of the Malays\nas to succession, it is interesting to compare the laws of another\nIndo-Chinese kingdom\u2014Cambodia. I take the following\naccount from a recent French work:\u2014\n\n\"Property in land does not exist in Cambodia, for, as is\nwell known, the State is the absolute proprietor of the soil.\nNevertheless, the enjoyment of lands is left to those who\nclear them and employ them for some specific cultivation,\nrice in particular. It happens also, sometimes, that the first\noccupiers are dispossessed without a word of warning, with-\nout the excuse of public interest and simply in order that\nsome one may help himself to a field quite fit for cultiva-\ntion.\"\n\n\"The fortune of a Cambodian is composed of moveable and\nimmovable property, land excepted. Generally speak-\ning, even the richest have not much money, but they own\nboats, elephants, horses, cattle, buffaloes, which they hire\nout; they have sometimes a large number of slaves whom\nthey employ at home either on the products which they cul-\ntivate or in all kinds of commercial and industrial underta-\nkings. Money is lent out at high rates of interest, but it is\nliable to catastrophes.\"\n\n\"The goods of a Cambodian who dies a widower and with-\nout children, go all to the State, that is to the King. If he\nleaves daughters only, the Government takes half of the\nproperty and divides the other half among them. If they\nare of tender age, the goods are deposited with their grand-\nfather who becomes their guardian.\"\n\n\"When the Government is a creditor of the deceased, the\nKing causes the whole of the debt to be exacted first of all\n\n* MOURA\u2014Le Royaume de Cambodge, I, 347.\n\"from the assets, and the balance, if any, is divided among the heirs.\"\n\n\"When the head of a family dies leaving several wives and several children, the child or children by whom he has been more exclusively nursed during his illness share the fortune according to the rank of their mother. For this purpose, the property is divided into seven parts; out of these, the son of the third wife has one, that of the second wife two, and that of the first, four. If these ladies have several children, the distribution is made, all the same, according to the proportion just mentioned. Children who are absent at the time of the sickness and death of their father lose a portion of their rights to the inheritance.\"\n\n\"If there are no children, the first wife keeps all the goods and the family remains united. Were the second and third wife to wish to leave the house before the conclusion of the mourning, that is to say, within three years, they would have the right to do so, but on the condition of renouncing their share of the inheritance. After the three years, if the widows separate, the property is divided among them according to the rule laid down for their children, when they have any, that is to say, the first has four shares, the second, two and the third, one.\"\n\n\"The widows of the same husband may marry again after three years of mourning; the second and third have not got to pay anything to the State for this, but the first wife, if she marry again and be without children by her first husband, must first surrender half of her fortune for the benefit of the royal treasury. If she does not marry again the Government takes the whole at her death.\"\n\n\"An adopted son renounces the right of inheriting from his real parents and cannot be sued for debts which they may have contracted in their lifetime. If the head of a family, after having adopted a child, becomes himself the father of a legitimate child, the adopted son does not lose all hope of inheriting, for the law gives him equal rights with the children of the full blood.\"\n\n\"Children, who, at the time of the death of their father, are in the special service of the King, have a right to three and a half shares of the inheritance.\"\n\"In case a husband, on account of the barrenness of his first wife, marries another who bears him a son, this latter is the sole heir of his father and he provides, after the death of the latter, for the support of the first widow and his own mother.\"\n\n\"The law of the Hindus sanctions similarly the right of the eldest son to the greater part of the patrimony of the father and mother. 'The eldest of the family,' says the law, 'if he be virtuous, may take possession of the whole of his patrimony of the father and mother, and the other brothers must live under his guardianship as they live under that of their father.'\"\n\n\"Generally, in India, distribution used to be made in the following way: the eldest had a double share, the second a share and a half, and the other brothers a single share respectively. The brothers gave to their sisters by the same mother a quarter of their shares to help them to establish themselves.\"\n\n---\n\n**Chapter IX.**\n\n**NATIVE TENURE UNDER EUROPEAN RULE.**\n\n**INDIA, BURMA, JAVA, CEYLON.**\n\n**INDIA.**\n\nA wholesale modification of the systems of land tenure of ancient and highly civilised communities in British India by the introduction of English law would obviously have been unwise. It has always been the object of British Administrators in that country to recognise native laws and customs relating to the tenure of land, and, in elaborating Revenue systems, to secure that the regulations laid down shall give due effect to every class of interest in land known to native laws. It has been gradually ascertained in the various pro-\nvinces what are the different degrees of right of occupants and proprietors and each interest has received definition in the Land Acts passed from time to time for particular provinces, divisions or districts. In such Acts, the terminology used in describing tenures, classes of proprietors, and occupants, documents evidencing title, and rents and other payments, is largely borrowed from the native languages. The use of terms which have a technical meaning in English law is thus avoided.\n\nSpeaking generally, the ra'iyat is the owner of his holding, subject to the payment of the assessed land revenue. No documentary evidence of title is necessary, though in some provinces he holds a patta, or official statement of the facts of his holding or assessment. His rights are alienable and heritable, but all transfers have to be registered.\n\nRevenue systems vary in different parts of India; there are practically two. The first contemplates settlement with a middleman; and the second, dealing with the individual cultivator direct\u2014(the ra'iyat-w\u00e1ri system). The Government may, in point of fact, either deal with a whole village at once through representative headmen, or may make a settlement of each individual holding.\n\nIn the latter case the settlement of a district is based upon a survey, the soil of every field is classified with a view to ascertaining the proper rate of assessment to be imposed, and eventually settlement records are made up, which include a register shewing the name of the occupant of every surveyed allotment.\n\nIn such a system, there is no place for English documents of title, and the tenure is none the less certain and secure because it is not supported by parchment and sealing-wax. The ra'iyat's name is down in the register of the village to which he belongs, and the extent of his land and the annual assessment which he has to pay are there recorded. The village records and the evidence of the headmen and villagers are at hand to support him if his right of occupancy is impugned.\n\n\"In Bombay (just as in Madras) the occupant holds on \"the simple terms of paying the revenue; if he admits that \"he is (or is proved by a decree of a Court to be) holding\n\"on behalf of some one else, as a tenant, or in an inferior position, then the 'superior holder's' name is entered in the register, not his: he becomes the 'inferior holder,' and it is the superior who is entered in the register as the 'occupant' responsible for the assessed sum. Any one who is recorded as the responsible holder can simply resign (if he does not like to pay the assessment) any field in his holding. The assessment is fixed for a period of thirty years, so that a man who elects to hold continuously, knows for certain that during that long period, all the profit he can make will go to him.\"\n\n\"At the beginning of each year, he can signify to the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r (or local revenue officer of a taluk sub-division) what fields he wishes to hold, and what he wishes to give up; as long as he does this in proper time, he is free to do as he pleases. If he relinquishes, the fields are available for any one else; if no one applies for them, they are usually auctioned as fallow (for the right of grazing) for the year, and so on, till some one offers to take them up for cultivation.\n\n\"Nothing whatever is said in the Revenue Code about the person in possession (on his own account) being 'owner' in the western sense. He is simply called the 'occupant,' and the Code says what he can do and what he cannot. The occupant may do anything he pleases to improve the land, but may not, without permission, do anything which diverts the holding from agricultural purposes. He has no right to mines or minerals.\"\n\n\"These are the facts of the tenure; you may theorise on them as you please; you may say this amounts to proprietorship, or this is a dominium minus plenum, or anything else.\"\n\n\"The question of tenancy is just as simply dealt with. I have stated that, if it appears that the occupant is in possession in behalf of some one else, that some one else is recorded as the 'superior holder,' and he becomes the 'inferior holder.'\"\n\n\"What sort of 'inferior'\u2014whether a tenant or on some other terms\u2014is a simple question of fact and of the agreement or the custom by which he holds,\"\n\"If an occupant dies, one (the eldest or responsible) heir must be entered as the succeeding occupant who has to pay the revenue, for there can only be one registered revenue-payer for each field with a separate survey number, though, of course, there may be several sharers (joint heirs of the deceased owner, for instance) in a number. Which of them is so entered, depends, of course, on consent, or on the result of a Court decree, if there is a dispute.\"\n\n\"Sharers can always get their shares partitioned and assessed separately, as long as there is no dispute as to what the shares are.\"*\n\nThe advantages enjoyed by the occupant of land under the survey settlement are:\n\n1st.\u2014Fixity of tenure conditional on the due payment of the Government demand.\n\n2ndly.\u2014His occupation is heritable and transferable by gift, sale, or mortgage, without other restriction than the requirement to give notice to the authorities.\n\n3rdly.\u2014His assessment is fixed, but subject to revision after periods of thirty years. The right of occupancy is not affected by the expiration of a term of settlement, being conditional solely on the payment of the assessment imposed.\n\n4thly.\u2014He is at liberty to resign his entire occupancy, or any recognised share or part of it defined by the survey in any year, provided notice be given by a fixed date. If waste land be available, he may enlarge his holding at pleasure on application to the district officials.\n\n5thly.\u2014He may sub-let his lands, and Government will assist him, under certain limitations, in recovering rents from his tenants.\n\n6thly.\u2014His holding cannot be encroached on by his neighbour, every sub-division of it being clearly defined by boundary marks, and susceptible of immediate identification by means of the village maps and registers. Further, the fact of his possession of any field or sub-division of it can be traced without difficulty in the village records year by year up\n\n* BADEN-POWELL\u2014Land Revenue and Land Tenure in India, 136-8.\nto the date of the introduction of the first survey settlement. Thus the chances of dispute and litigation are entirely removed, or reduced to a minimum. Subject, then, to the part of the Government assessment, the occupant of land under the survey tenure may be said to enjoy every right of property that he can desire, with the advantage of possessing a title the most simple and complete that can be imagined.*\n\nBRITISH BURMA.\n\nThe rights of the land-holder, subject to the revenue demands of Government, have been just as carefully guarded in British Burma. The Land Act of that province (Act II of 1876) is founded upon earlier local regulations, which were themselves an epitome, more or less, of the laws and customs of the Burmese as to tenure of land. The land-holder in Burma has, like the ra'iyat in Malacca, a proprietary right, but in the case of the former, this right is inchoate until there have been twelve years' continuous possession; whereas in the case of the Malay mere appropriation and possession create the right at once, provided that clearing and cultivation are undertaken.\n\nIn British Burma, \"if a person (not holding under a grant or order of Government which itself determines the extent of right) has continuously held possession of any culturable land for twelve years, and has continuously paid the revenue due thereon, or held it exempt on express grant, he is allowed to have acquired a permanent heritable and transferable title. It will not, however, do for a man to be able to assert former or ancient possession if that possession came to an end twelve years before the Act came into force (1st February, 1879). Possession, on the other hand, is not broken by a succession or transfer. If A has held for seven years, and then sells to B, who has held for five, B can put in a twelve years' possession. So if B has inherited from A. In the same way as regards the condition of paying the revenue. The payment will hold good if it has been made by a tenant\n\n* Bombay Administration Report, 1882-3, p. 32,\n\"or other person holding under the person in possession. The\n\"land-holder's right is not called proprietary, because it is\n\"restricted not only by the duty of paying revenue, taxes, and\n\"cesses, which is a restriction on all property in land in India,\n\"but also by the fact that all mines and mineral products and\n\"buried treasure are reserved to Government, as also the right\n\"to work or search for those products on paying compensation\n\"for the surface damage.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"Any 'land-holder' can obtain an authoritative declara-\n\"tion that he is such, by applying to have his right recorded\n\"on a register provided for the purpose, and getting a certi-\n\"ficate of the record.

Under Dutch rule, prior to the con-\nquest of Java by the English in 1811, no proprietary tenure\nwas introduced, and the native system remained unmodified if\nthe following description given by RAFFLES is a correct one:\u2014\n\n\"The Dutch Company, actuated solely by the spirit of gain,\n\"and viewing their Javan subjects with less regard or consi-\n\"deration than a West Indian planter formerly viewed the\n\"gang upon his estate, because the latter had paid the pur-\n\"chase money of human property which the other had not,\n\"employed all the pre-existing machinery of despotism, to\n\"squeeze from the people their utmost mite of contribution,\n\"the last dregs of their labour, and thus aggravated the evils\n\"of a capricious and semi-barbarous government by working\n\"it with all the practised ingenuity of politicians, and all the\n\"monopolising selfishness of traders.\"\u2020\n\n* BADEN-POWELL\u2014Land Revenue and Land Tenure in India, 700-702.\n\u2020 History of Java, I, 168, (2nd edition).\nSecurity of tenure and protection from unjust exactions are the desiderata indicated in the eloquent passage which follows, written with all the burning indignation with which RAFFLES avowed the tyranny and rapacity of the Dutch Colonial Officials of those days inspired him:\u2014\n\n\"Can it, therefore, be a subject of surprise, that the arts of agriculture and the improvement of society have made no greater advances in Java? Need it excite wonder that the implements of husbandry are simple; that the cultivation is unskilful and inartificial; that the state of the roads, where European convenience is not consulted, is bad; that the natural advantages of the country are neglected; that so little enterprise is displayed or capital employed; that the peasant's cottage is mean, and that so little wealth and knowledge are among the agricultural population; when it is considered that the occupant of land enjoys no security for reaping the fruits of his industry; when his possession is liable to be taken away from him every season, or to suffer each an enhancement of rent as will drive him from it; when such a small quantity of land only is allowed him as will yield him bare subsistence, and every ear of grain that can be spared from the supply of his immediate wants, is extorted from him in the shape of tribute; when his personal services are required unpaid for, in the train of luxury or in the culture of articles of monopoly; and when in addition to all these discouragements, he is subject to other heavy imposts and impolitic restraints? No man will exert himself, when acting for another, with so much zeal as when stimulated by his own immediate interest; and under a system of government, where everything but the bare means of subsistence is liable to be seized, nothing but the bare means of subsistence will be sought to be attained.\"\n\n* \"It is but right, however, to say that the Dutch, while admitting their old Colonial rule to have been most objectionable in many ways, deny the systematic atrocities imputed to them by RAFFLES and CRAWFURD, both of whom, the Dutch say, distorted the facts and working of their old Colonial Government, which was only known to these authors by hearsay.\" MONEY'S Java, I, 57, citing TEMMINCK'S Coup d'\u0153il g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur les Possessions N\u00e9erlandaises dans l'Inde Archipelagique, I, 13.\n\n\u2020 RAFFLES\u2014Hist. of Java, Id.\nTo transmute the serf into a proprietor, and to give him immunity from forced labour and other exactions, was the task which RAFFLES set himself. To use his own words: \"The foundation of the amended system was, 1st\u2014The entire abolition of forced deliveries at inadequate rates, and of all feudal services, with the establishment of a perfect freedom in cultivation and trade; 2nd\u2014The assumption, on the part of Government, of the immediate superintendence of the lands with the collection of the resources and rents thereof; 3rd\u2014The renting out of the lands so assumed to the actual occupants, in large or small estates, according to local circumstances, on leases for a moderate term. In the course of the following years (1814 and 1815) these measures were carried into execution in most of the districts under our Government, with a view to the eventual establishment of a perpetual settlement, on the principle of the ryotwar or as it has been termed in Java, the ti\u00e1ng-\u00e1lit system.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * *\n\n\"In the first settlement, leases were only granted for a year, or, at the utmost, three years, and were given to intermediate renters; but in the more detailed settlement of 1814, after sufficient information had been collected on the state of the country, Government determined to act directly with the individual cultivator and to lay the foundation of a permanent system. By this latter period, the experiments had been tried to a certain extent, and had succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectation. Difficulties met us in the way, but they were by no means insurmountable: there were at first imperfections in the system, but they did not affect its principle, and were easily removed. By the zeal, the ability, and industry of the various officers entrusted with the execution of the duty, whatever was practicable in furtherance of the object in which they felt deeply interested, was accomplished. In the course of the years 1814 and 1815, the new system was introduced into Bantam, Cheribon and the eastern districts, over a population of a million and a half of cultivators, not only without disturbance and opposition, but to the satisfaction of all classes of the natives, and to the manifest increase of the public revenue derivable from land.\"\nRAFFLES' system was the *ra'iyat-w\u0101ri* system of Bengal; a proprietary right was accorded to the cultivator, and a temporary settlement was arrived at with him as to the amount of assessment payable by him in lieu of the miscellaneous liabilities of former times. The assessment was payable in money or kind (grain). It was intended that this should be a stepping-stone to a permanent settlement, when experience should have shewn the justice or otherwise of the scale first determined upon. This was:\n\nFor *sawah* lands (rice-fields).\n1st quality of soil, one-half of the estimated produce.\n2nd quality of soil, two-fifths of the estimated produce.\n3rd quality of soil, one-third of the estimated produce.\n\nFor *t\u0113gal* lands (maize, &c.).\n1st quality of soil, two-fifths of the estimated produce.\n2nd quality of soil, one-third of the estimated produce.\n3rd quality of soil, one-fourth of the estimated produce.\n\nChiefs and headmen of villages were continued in office as Collectors of Revenue. Individual rights were recorded in a document, kept for inspection in every village office, in which the name of every land-holder in the village and the amount of his assessment were to be found.\n\nAbout the year 1818, two years after the restoration of Java to the Dutch, RAFFLES' experiment was abandoned as unsuccessful, and the Government of Netherlands India went back to the system of settlement with the village for the whole village lands. \"The yearly allotment of lands was then left to be made as before, and the legal fiction of the separate property of each village in certain specified fields was abolished.\"\n\nThe present system of land-tenure in Java, which is founded on the native customary law, is thus explained by Mr. MONEY:\u2014\n\n\"*Old Land Tenure and Rent under Native Rule.\u2014The old idea under the Native rule was, that the land belonged to the prince, the usufruct of it to the cultivator. The price of\n\n*MONEY'S Jawa, I, 76.*\nthe usufruct, or the rent, was one-fifth of the produce, and\none-fifth of the peasant's labour, or one day's gratuituous\nlabour in the Java week of five days. The Dutch, in re-\nverting to the old system, logically carried out this idea,\nholding that they had conquered the prince and not the\npeople, and therefore came into the prince's rights. They\nhowever, reduced the labour rent from one-fifth to one-\nseventh, substituting one day in the European week of seven\ndays, for one day in the Java week of five days.\"\n\n\"The different systems of land tenure in the island all\nderive from this idea.\"\n\n\"Landlord Property.\u2014Where the Dutch are masters by\ntreaty and not by conquest, the produce rent and the labour\nrent are paid, not to the Dutch but to the Native Princes, as\nin the Preanger and in Soerakarta and Djokjokarta. In the\nrest of the island, where the Dutch are masters by conquest,\nthe one-fifth of produce and one-seventh of labour belong\nto the Dutch Government, except on private estates, where\nthe Government has pro tanto granted away its rights.\nThere the one fifth and one-seventh are paid by the peasant\nto the European or Chinese landowner, and the landowner\npays to Government three-fourths of one per cent. per\nannum on the total value of his estate, equal at most to\none-fifth of the net yearly income.\"\n\n\"Peasant's Property.\u2014The peasant's property under the\nNative system to which the Dutch reverted, is of three kinds.\n\n1st. Village lands belonging jointly to the whole village\ncommunity, to his share in which every householder has a\nright. These joint village lands are yearly partitioned and\nseparately allotted to every head of family according to the\nsize of his family, and according to their capacity to culti-\nvate the land so allotted.\"\n\n2nd. Lands formerly uncultivated, which belong exclu-\nsively to the peasant who brings them into cultivation. For\nthese he pays the one-fifth and one-seventh after five years,\nbut is exempt from all payment for them, and from all\ngratuitous labour whatever, during the first five years.\"\n\n3rd. Lands which have descended from the first cultivator\nto his representatives.\n\"The first cultivator, however, and also his representatives, whether by purchase or descent, have, besides the land which is exclusively theirs, their share as householders in the village lands, so long as they choose to claim and cultivate such share, but no longer. Either the first cultivator or his descendants can sell any part of such their exclusive land, but only as a peasant holding to some other cultivator, and the purchaser stands in the seller's place, paying his one-fifth and one-seventh. When any holder of such exclusive land dies without heirs, his exclusive land reverts to the common lands of the village within whose boundaries it lies. In some districts, by custom, the first cultivator only holds the land exclusively rent and labour free for six years, when it reverts to the common lands of the village.\"\n\n\"Such were the old land tenures and land rent to which the Dutch reverted, with the modification of the old labour rent of one day in five being reduced to the lesser rate of one day in seven. The Java cottier would of course have preferred the reduction of the produce rent without the imposition of the labour rent; but, much as the Oriental peasant hates labour, he still more hates parting with money. The return to the old state of things was effected not only without disturbance, but, the Dutch say, without even any visible signs of dissatisfaction.\"\n\n\"Present Java Land Tenure.\u2014This simple and well-defined system of land tenure has ever since obtained all through Java, except in the Native states of Soerakarta and Djokjokarta, districts on the Southern Coast of Java, which still maintain a kind of protected and controlled independence, like many of the Native states within our Indian territory. There the old one-fifth of produce in kind and one-fifth of labour are still received by the Native princes in the old manner, and applied generally to the old purposes.\"\n\n\"The system which the Dutch substituted for our Ryot-warree not only applies to Government lands and to the Preanger, but also to private estates. The landlord's claim for rent, long limited by customs, was in 1833 expressly limited by law to one-fifth of his tenant's produce, and to one day's gratuitous labour in seven. The produce rent on\nGovernment land is not expressly limited by law to one-fifth but is settled at that rate with the village chief for the whole village, and must be paid in money. The one-fifth of produce on private estates is generally taken by the landlords from each cottier in kind. The labour rent on crown lands is mostly employed on the roads and public works. On private estates the labour rent is generally applied by the landlord to the cultivation of such parts of his property as he keeps in his own hand. In other respects the produce and labour rents are paid to Government or to a private landlord as follows:\n\nLabour Rent.\u2014Every cottier, whether on Government land or on a private estate, gives his one day's gratuitous labour in every seven to his landlord, according to the roster kept by the elected village chief. As this gratuitous labour is a part of the rent for land yielding produce, it is not payable by the artisan, or by any one holding house property only. So also, as only one-seventh of labour is due by each family, the head of the family alone is borne on the roster, but any competent grown member of the family, or other substitute, performs the labour for him. Although when the yearly appropriation of village lands takes place, a large family gets more than a small one, still only one-seventh of one man's labour is due by that family, however large. The result very generally is, that, in each village, the householders employ some few day labourers to do the gratuitous labour for the whole village, for which they receive a certain daily payment from the villagers. By constant work on the Government roads and irrigation embankments, or on the landowner's private farm, these men become good hands, the villagers get off their one-seventh of labour for a small payment, and thus every one is satisfied.\n\nProduce Rent.\u2014When the rice crop is ripe, but before it is cut, it is assessed by agreement both as to quantity and value between the cottier tenant and the landlord. In case of agreement both as to quantity and value, the peasant is left to cut down and sell his crop, and has to pay the amount agreed on four months after harvest. If the landlord re-\nquires the one-fifth of produce to be paid in kind, the tenant\nmust deliver it at the landlord's grange on the property as\nsoon as reaped.\"\n\n\"If landlord and tenant cannot agree as to the number of\npiculs the different fields will yield per bahu, the rest of the\nvillagers are called in, the crop is at once cut down, tied up\nin geddings or bundles of padi as big as can be held in the\ntwo arms, and put up in heaps of five geddings each. The\nlandlord or his agent then takes one gedding from every\nheap. The villagers get a certain proportion of the geddings\nfor cutting down and stacking the crop, which, makes it the\nthe tenant's interest to agree to a rather higher assess-\nment in quantity, so as to be left to cut down his crop him-\nself. The landlord is subject to the disadvantage, in thus\nhaving the crop cut down by the villagers, of having to carry\naway his own share, which also induces him not to insist\non quite the highest valuation in quantity he thinks the\ncan bear.\"\n\n\"If the landlord and tenant agree as to quantity, but can-\nnot agree as to the market price, the peasant is left to reap\nhis crop himself, and has to deliver to the landlord one-fifth\nof the stipulated quantity of padi in kind, for the safe de-\nlivery of which the village chief is also responsible.\"\n\n\"The value to be agreed on is the current market value of\nthe neighbourhood in full harvest, and when consequently\nthe price is lower than the average throughout the year.\nThe cottier knows that if the landlord and he can agree as\nto value, he will have four months time to pay in. He\nknows that as soon as the harvest is all in, and the produce\nrent of the neighbourhood has either been sold on the spot\nor been sent away for export, produce will rise again to the\nusual price through the year in his locality. It is the tenant's\ninterest, therefore, to agree to both the assessed quantity and\nvalue if not exorbitant, while the landlord's estimate is kept\nwithin bounds by the tenant's right to pay the actual one-\nfifth in kind.\"\n\n\"Large European Landowners.\u2014Although, as previously\nmentioned, the English Government of Java found on in-\nquiry that the Native chiefs did not even claim any propri-\ntary rights in the soil, yet in some few instances considera-\nble tracts of crown land were bestowed by us on Natives as\nprivate estates. On the return of the Dutch all our grants\nand alienations of crown land were recognised, but from that\ntime the Java crown lands have only been leased out, and\nnever granted away. The few Natives, whom we thus made\nlanded proprietors, then entered into the same condition as the\nold European and Chinese landed proprietors, and their\nestates became liable to sale for arrears of land tax or for\nmortgage debt. The reckless and extravagant habits of\nthese Native landowners have gradually alienated most of\ntheir properties, and there are now not above half-a-dozen\nNatives, out of the Preanger and other Native states,\nwho are still owners of land. There is no prohibition a-\ngainst any Native buying any private estate which is for sale,\nbut the practice is discouraged by the Dutch Government.\"\n\nThe culture-system, a description of which does not fall\nwithin the scope of this paper, has been founded upon and is\nin no way inconsistent with the native customary tenure.\n\nC E Y L O N .\n\nThe land-revenue system of Ceylon is based upon native\ncustom, which, in this respect, resembles the practice, common\nto the Malays and other Indo-Chinese peoples, of levying a\ntenth or other proportionate share of the produce. A local\nOrdinance, passed in Ceylon in 1849, gave legislative sanction\nto a procedure devised for securing the due collection of the\nGovernment share of the crops of paddy and dry grain grown\nin the island. This tax was a well-recognised impost leviable\nby custom and continued by Government proclamations issued\nin the early years of British occupation.*\n\nThe law of 1849, which is still in force, describes the duty\nleviable to be \"a tax of one-tenth or such other proportion\nof the crops of paddy and dry grain grown in and upon all\nlands now liable thereto, as by law, custom, or usage is at\npresent levied or payable.\"\n\n* Ordinance XIV of 1840, quoting in the preamble Proclamations of Sept.\n3rd, 1801, and Nov. 21st, 1818.\nThe mode of collecting the tax was, in 1841, described as follows, by one who had held high office in Ceylon and whose unfavourable opinion of this system of collecting a land revenue was formed, therefore, after some experience:\n\n\"When the crop is sufficiently advanced to enable an estimate to be formed of its possible produce, the Government Assessors proceed to calculate its probable value, and a return is made to the Government Agent of the amount leviable upon every field. The farm of the tax of each district is then sold by public auction; and, as the harvest approaches, the cultivator is obliged to give five days' notice to the purchaser of his intention to cut; two days' notice if he finds it necessary to postpone; if the crop be not threshed immediately, the renter is entitled to a further notice of the day fixed for that purpose; and for any omission or irregularity he has a remedy by suing for a penalty in the District Court.\"\n\n\"It would be difficult to devise a system more pregnant with oppression, extortion, and demoralisation than the one here detailed. The cultivator is handed over helplessly to two successive sets of inquisitorial officers\u2014the assessors and the renters; whose acts are so uncontrolled that abuses are inevitable, and the intercourse of the two parties is characterised by vigour and extortion on the one side, and cunning and subterfuges of every description on the other. Every artifice and disingenuous device is put in practice to deceive the headmen and assessors as to the extent and fertility of the land and the actual value of the crop; and they, in return, resort to the most inquisitorial and vexatious interference, either to protect the interest of the Government, or privately to further their own. Between these demoralising influences, the character and industry of the rural population are deteriorated and destroyed. The extention of cultivation by reclaiming a portion of waste land only exposes the harassed proprietor to fresh visits from the headmen, and a new valuation by the Government Assessor, and where annoyance is not the leading object, recourse is had to corruption, in order to keep down the valuation.\"\n\"But no sooner has the cultivator got rid of the assessor than he falls into the hands of the renter, who, under the authority with which the law invests him, finds himself possessed of unusual powers of vexation and annoyance. He may be designedly out of the way when the cultivator sends notice of his intention to cut; and if the latter, to save his harvest from perishing on the stalk, ventures to reap it in his absence, the penalties of the law are instantly enforced against him. Under the pressure of this formidable control, the agricultural proprietor, rather than lose his time or his crop in dancing attendance on the renter, or submitting to the multiform annoyances of his subordinates, is driven to pursue forbearance by additional payments; and it is generally understood that the share of the tax which eventually reaches the Treasury does not form one-half of the amount which is thus extorted by oppressive devices from the helpless proprietors.\"\n\nThe same process which is here described for the collection of the tax upon rice lands in the valleys is resorted to for realising that upon dry grain in the uplands and hills; and it is a striking confirmation of the discouragement to the extension of agriculture, which is inseparable from a system so vexatious and so oppressive, that by a return of the produce of the paddy tax and that on dry grain for the years prior to 1846, during which the cultivation of every other description of produce had been making extensive advances, it was shewn that the production of corn had been for some time stationary in Ceylon; and the increase has been very inconsiderable since.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter X.**\n\n**Land Tenure in Malacca Under European Rule.**\n\nBritish rule in Malacca dates from 1825, the year in which the cession arranged by the treaty with the Netherlands of\n\n* Sir Emerson Tennent's Hist. of Ceylon, II, 170, n.\n1824 was carried into effect. It is true that from 1795 to 1818, Malacca had been held by the English, but this was more in the nature of a military occupation, which might come to an end at any time on the cessation of war, than permanent civil administration. As far as can be learned, the Government of Malacca between 1795 and 1818 went on very much as it had under the Dutch, save for the removal of restrictions on cultivation and trade and for the humane reforms of Lord Munro in the criminal procedure.* At all events at first, documents dealing with rights in land were made out in the Dutch language for the signature of the English Governor.\n\nTaking 1825 as the starting point, what was the land tenure of the Settlement as the British found it in that year? I reply unhesitatingly that it was the native tenure of the Malays, unchanged in any way either by Portuguese or Dutch rulers.\u2020 All the evidence supports this, the absence of any express land laws or regulations passed during the preceding period of European rule, the fact that such records as we have of the Dutch administration exhibit the government upholding the customary rules of native tenure, the fact that in their other eastern possessions the Dutch have consistently maintained the native tenure as they found it, and the fact that at the date of the final cession of Malacca a code of regulations was under the consideration of the Dutch Government, which is founded in all respects upon local custom and has nothing in common with any European system.\n\nThere were very good reasons why the tenure of Malacca should not have been interfered with. The Portuguese rule was the mere military occupation of a fortress, by which the command of the Straits, and thereby of the eastern trade, was\n\n* \"Malacca was to have been restored to the Dutch at the peace of Amiens, in 1802; but war recommenced (May 1803) before the transfer was made, and the Dutch falling again under the gripe of France, it consequently remained in the hands of the British until 1818. The law of Holland continued to be administered, and the decrees of the courts of justice passed in the name of their High Mightinesses.\"\u2014NEWBOLD, I, 126.\n\n\u2020 \"The Portuguese, while they held Malacca, and, after them, the Dutch, left the Malay customs, or lex non scripta, in force.\" See the judgment of Sir Benson Maxwell in Sahrip v. Mitchell and ano., Appendix, p. xli,\nmaintained. They were frequently besieged, and the enemy was on more than one occasion up to their very gates. It would be absurd to suppose that any new land system was devised or introduced for the limited area covered by the fort and town in those troublous times. The Dutch drove out the Portuguese in 1640. At no time during their occupation did the Dutch open up the interior by means of roads: their forts at St. John's hill and elsewhere shew that the suburbs were not always peaceful, and there is little reason to suppose that their direct rule extended far from the town of Malacca itself. The whole object of their establishment was trade, and, in the words of an English official who had studied the subject, \"Malacca was considered a mere outpost of the 'Supreme Colonial Government in Java for securing Dutch supremacy and monopoly in the Straits. Not only was agriculture discouraged, but it was absolutely prevented. The cultivation of grain was forbidden as interfering with monopoly in Java, and other species of tropical cultivation were equally disallowed from the same cause.'\"* Among the sources of revenue of the Dutch Government before 1795 there is no mention of land revenue, and the absence of this item is sufficiently accounted for by the statement just quoted.\n\nThe Dutch did not introduce any land laws, or derive any public revenue from land, but they fully recognised individual rights in land, and supplied the means of proving title by written documents. These rights were, for the most part, rights acquired under the local native customs, and the manner in which they were transferred was quite in keeping with the native mode of thought. I have already quoted (sup., p. 120) a passage from the Kedah laws in which it is laid down\n\n---\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 737; Id. X, 45.\u2014\"Though under the dominion of an European power for about 250 years, it remains, even to the foot of the lines of the town, as wild and uncultivated as if there had never been a settlement formed here, and except by the small river that passes between the fort and town, you cannot penetrate into the country in any direction above a few miles; nor is even this extent general, being confined to the roads that run along the seashore about two miles each way and one that goes inland (about four miles).\"\u2014Capt. LENNON'S Journal,\u20141796\u2014Journ. Straits Branch R. A. S., No. 7, p. 62.\nthat the Raja's concurrence shall be necessary to validate a transfer made by a land-owner to another. This is the principle upon which the Dutch documents of title, still extant in Malacca, seem to have been issued. A purchaser or inheritor of land had to go before the Court of Justice and declare and prove the transaction by which he claimed possession of the land. Upon satisfactory proof being adduced, the Court confirmed the transfer or transmission and issued to him a document in the nature of a certificate of his right of possession, that is of his proprietary right under the local law. The greater part of the land in the town of Malacca is held in this manner, and it has been hastily assumed that the certificates of the Dutch Court of Justice have superseded earlier grants issued to the original proprietors. I do not believe that there is, in the majority of cases, any foundation for such an assumption. Land in the town and suburbs of Malacca was in the possession of individuals before the Dutch occupation\u2014and before the Portuguese conquest for the matter of that. It was held and continued to be held either by the native possessors or by new-comers, with or without the permission of the ruling authority, under the local tenure. Only, after the establishment of a Court of Justice by the Dutch, secret alienation was not permitted. A transfer of land had to receive the sanction of the government, in whom theoretically the soil was vested, and this, as has been shewn, is quite in accordance with Malay ideas.\n\nThe uncertainty attending the terms on which such land could be held is clearly evidenced in some of the Dutch documents. Sometimes it is expressly declared that the land is subject to any taxes, &c., which may at any future time be imposed, and this sufficiently indicates that the terms ultimately to be imposed were not settled, though it was well understood that land was liable to a customary tax if the Government should at any time choose to exact it. But, as I have shewn, no land revenue was collected in Malacca in Dutch times and presumably no tax was ever imposed. The land on which the town of Malacca stands pays no rent, tax or revenue of any kind to the Government, to this day. But there can be little doubt that it is open to the Government of\nthe Colony to exact any reasonable assessed rental at any time, if, as I contend, the tenure on which this land is held is the native tenure of the country and in no sense \"fee simple,\" as the holders of it would like to maintain.\n\nThe Dutch claimed authority over the interior of the province of Malacca, though they neither made roads, maintained order, or otherwise directly governed the district. The greater part of it was granted away as terres particuli\u00e8res (see sup. p. 96) to Dutch settlers, traders, or officials in the town, and in some instances to natives. These had, that is to say, the right of standing in the place of the Government and collecting the customary tenth on produce. Several families were able to make a small income in this way, through Malay headmen appointed by them over these lands, or through Chinese sub-renters to whom they farmed out their privileges. But they had no right to the soil, and there is little reason to suppose that the Europeans either lived on or even visited the lands over which their rights extended.\n\nThis again is a purely native institution, copied by the Dutch. Its origin will be found in the extract from the Malacca Code, in Appendix I p. xv, and in the description of the \"private lands\" in Java by Dr. Winckel (sup. p. 94), who expressly states that the custom there is a native one which originated with the Javanese sovereigns.\n\nBesides the occupiers of the town and suburban lands and the proprietors (tuan tanah) of the concessions just mentioned, there were the Malay peasantry in the interior, proprietors, sub-tenants or mere cultivators, as the case might be, under the native laws already described. That these were never very numerous in Dutch times, when the cultivation of rice was absolutely forbidden, may be assumed from the fact that in the eight years from 1828 to 1836, (paddy-planting having been permitted since 1795) the average number of cultivators paying tenths was only 2,364.* In fact, under Dutch rule, the concessions must have paid very little to their proprietors, and\n\n* Newbold, I, 165. Mr. W. T. Lewis, Assistant Resident of Malacca, in 1828 estimated the Malacca territory to be 450 square miles, of which 5,653 acres only were cultivated.\nit was only under the British Government, after 1795, that they began to be valuable.\n\nThe land-holders, then, in Malacca, at the time that the British took possession of the place finally in 1825, were of three classes:\n\n1.\u2014Holders of land in the town and suburbs, with or without certificates of the Court of Justice;\n2.\u2014Proprietors of concessions, in the nature of Zamin-d\u0101ri rights, over country lands;\n3.\u2014Native cultivators having a proprietary right;\u2014all holding under the local customary tenure of the country.\n\nIt was difficult at first for the officers of the new Government to obtain accurate information as to the state of the tenure. The persons belonging to the second of the three classes just enumerated\u2014\"proprietors,\" as they called themselves, \"tithe-owners\" or \"impropriators,\" as Mr. Young termed them*\u2014commenced by making wholly inadmissible claims. For a time it seemed as if the whole of the land of the Province, beyond the town-limits, was the absolute property of \"proprietors,\" whether cultivated land, waste land, or forest. There was no one to appeal to for information as to the nature of the tenure except the \"proprietors\" themselves and their friends and relations. Such information as they could or would give will be found in the minutes of a meeting held by the Resident Councillor on the 10th of October, 1826 (Appendix II). They claimed the unqualified ownership of hundreds of square miles of land, the greater part of which was uncleared forest because, though the rights granted in respect of it had been conferred with a view to its being cleared, the Dutch Government had never enforced this stipulation! They called the cultivators their \"tenants,\" and denied the right of any one to settle on their alleged estates without permission; yet they admitted the right of a \"tenant\" to sell, mortgage and devise his land and to extend his property by taking up waste land at will. They alleged a customary right to collect\n\n* Correspondence relating to the Land Revenue System, S.S.\u2014Mr. Young's 3rd Report, pp. 51-75.\na rent which was ordinarily a tenth of all produce, but admitted that they had no right to levy a higher rate.\n\nIt need hardly be said that this description was not sufficient to convince the Governor (Mr. Fullerton) that the relative rights of Government, \"proprietor,\" and \"tenants\" had been correctly stated.* He pointed out the inconsistencies which occurred in the information elicited at the meeting, and the claims of the concessionaires to be absolute owners were never recognised. It was made clear by the production of a Dutch Proclamation, dated 14th December, 1773, and a later one dated 20th May, 1819 (Appendix IV), that the latter were forbidden, under pain of a heavy fine, from levying more than one-tenth of the produce from the cultivators. This satisfied the Governor that all that had ever been given up by the Dutch Government to the concessionaires was the right of collecting the tax of one-tenth of the produce, and that no valid claim could be made out to any absolute right of ownership of the soil. It was decided to redeem the rights which had been thus given up, and in 1828 these were repurchased by Government from the concessionaires, who received in lieu of them hereditary allowances calculated according to the respective values of the concessions so re-acquired by Government. In a few cases, owing to absence from the Settlement, or incapacity to contract, on the part of the persons entitled, the re-purchase of the right of levying the tenth was not carried out, and this right is, therefore, still enjoyed by a few individuals in Malacca.\n\nThe lands at Malacca, having been just freed from the incubus of a middleman between Government and the cultivator, were taken in hand by the authorities. A Superintendent of Lands was appointed, and a Regulation for the Administration of the Land Revenue Department was passed on the 25th June, 1828, which, after approval by the Board of Directors, became Regulation IX of 1830.\n\nThe foundation of much of the mal-administration that has followed may be traced to this very incomplete measure. The Government ought then to have decided whether the tithe\n\n* See Mr. Fullerton's minute, Appendix II, p. xxx.\nsystem was to be persisted in or not; whether land was thenceforth to be taken up in the old way and to be subject to the payment of tenths, or whether any other system of tenure was to be introduced. But what was done was this:\n\n(1). The Government determined to collect the tenth on produce which had just been re-acquired from the former tithe-owners, and toll-houses were erected throughout the country to intercept produce on its way to market.\n\n(2). A determination was announced to survey the holdings of the then cultivators and to issue \"title-deeds\" for them. This was not carried out.*\n\n(3). For lands disposed of subsequently, grants and leases were to be issued under English law.\n\n(4). The Regulation was silent as to the method of enforcing the levy of the tenth.\n\nIs it surprising that the result has been incessant confusion ever since? Here was a native tenure easily intelligible and suited to the customs and traditions of the people. It was possible to carry it out in its entirety by encouraging the exercise of the free right of taking up land for agricultural purposes and the acquisition of an alienable proprietary right, subject to the payment of tenths, and by providing legal machinery for the collection of tenths and the punishment of persons evading payment. It was possible, on the other hand, to abandon it, to levy an assessment (founded, as in India, on a rough survey or estimate of area) in lieu of it, and to alienate lands in the future on this system. But neither of these systems was adopted. The old lands cultivated and liable to tenths before 1830 remained subject to the native customs, but they were not identified by registration or survey. Lands taken up and brought into cultivation without permission after 1830 could not, therefore, in subsequent years, be dis-\n\n* \"A Surveyor was appointed, but before he had been many months employed, his services were dispensed with in the general reduction, and in consequence until this day (1856), except in the immediate vicinity of the town, the lands are not measured, nor do the tenants hold any documents to prove their rights.\" Journ. Ind. Arch., X, 61,\ntinguished from them. The tithe system was maintained, but the toll-houses proved to be a nuisance and at the same time an inefficient means of collecting the tax. It must have been obvious that much produce liable to the tax would not pass the toll-houses at all, while, on the other hand, produce exempt from taxation, i.e., that derived from the lands of Penghulus, etc., and from lands leased or granted on a quit-rent after 1830, would very likely be charged. The outlook from the first was not promising, and two important facts\u2014one legal and the other administrative\u2014tended to aggravate all the other difficulties. One was the decision of the Recorder, Sir B. \"Malkin,\"* \"that the introduction of the King's charter into these Settlements had introduced the existing law of Eng-land also, except in some cases where it was modified by express provision, and had abrogated any law previously existing,\"\u2020 and the other was the alteration in the form of government and the reduction of establishments which took place about 1830. Thenceforward there were only two officers to perform all the executive and judicial duties of the station.\u00a7\n\nThe Malacca Land Regulation (IX of 1830) was not long regarded as law. It was passed by the same authority as the Singapore Land Regulation, which was judicially declared by Sir B. Malkin, to be illegal because it was not a Regulation \"for imposing duties and taxes,\" those being the only purposes for which the Governor in Council of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malacca could legislate.\u00b6\n\nChanges in the law and in the Government were followed soon afterwards by the Naning War (1831-2). So it will be seen that the years which immediately followed the cession of Malacca were characterised by a number of incidents which rendered the establishment of a successful administration of the Land Department a very difficult operation.\n\n---\n\n* Rodyk v.

On the continent of India, the Governments are invested with legislative power, and that power is exercised in prescribed form, by the enactment and promulgation of laws registered in the Judicial Department, under the term of Regulations. Those Regulations, besides providing for the forms of administering justice, define the relative rights of the Government and the subject, and prescribe the mode under which those rights are to be inferred on the one part, maintained on the other, by application to local Provincial Courts, bound to act according to those Regulations. The Supreme Courts have no jurisdiction in any matters of Revenue, or the collection thereof. In the Revenue Department, public officers hold summary powers of enforcing, in the first instance, all demands, whether for payment of arrears, ejecting from lands unduly held, leaving the onus prosequendi on the party suppressing himself aggrieved, distrain when no arrear is due, or ejectment from lands properly belonging to him. It is only under the exercise of the summary process that the collection of the Government Revenue in India is insured. In these eastern settlements the Government has no power of framing those legislative provisions. There does not, therefore, exist any distinct and clear definition of relative rights, or prescribed mode of enforcing and preserving them. There are no Provincial Courts acting under local law. Government possesses no power of enforcing its demands. The Court administering justice as a Revenue Court is a King's Court, framed on the English model, and taking the common law of England as its guide. Questions of Revenue, there-\nfore, whether arising from land or excise, fall to be tried under principles that have no relation or resemblance to the local situation of the country and its inhabitants. Before demands can be enforced, legal process in all the English forms must be resorted to; writs of ejectment must be sued for: suits entered for arrears; delays, expenses, doubts and difficulties arise that render it easy for the people to evade the payment of all demands, and induce the officers of Government rather to abandon the demand, small in individual cases, though considerable in the aggregate, rather than encounter all the difficulties and go through forms which they cannot understand. Let us suppose, for example's sake, that the Supreme Court at Calcutta were at once declared the only Revenue Court; that every arrear of Revenue, every question resulting from its collection, or the occupation of land, were to be tried there in the first instance, under all its forms; would it possible to realize the Land Revenue? Yet this, in a small way, is exactly our case. Singapore, indeed, is of recent acquisition, and the titles hitherto given have been in English form: but even at Singapore, there is much land occupied without any title whatever; and unless something is done by regular enactment, possession will make a title, as it has done in this Island, from the neglect of the local authorities. But how are we to regulate decisions at Malacca? There the sovereign right is one-tenth of the produce; the Dutch made over the right to certain of the inhabitants more than 100 years ago. This Government, by way of insuring increase of cultivation and introduction of population, redeemed the right. How are we to levy the tenth, if refused? The land tenures at Malacca bear no analogy or resemblance to any English tenure; yet by such they must, in case of doubt, be tried. Regulations adapted to the case have indeed been sent to England, but until local legislation is applied, and the mode of administering justice better adapted to the circumstances of the place, it seems to me quite useless to attempt the realization of any Revenue whatever.\n\nReferences to Bengal on the many vexed questions relative to the occupation and alienation of land in the Straits were\nincessant for the next ten years. Each of the three Settlements had its separate history and its peculiar administrative difficulties, and it was no easy task to find out and apply the proper remedies in each. In 1837 the Supreme Government in Calcutta gave effect to some of Sir B. Malkin's recommendations by repealing the local Land Regulations (the legality of which was more than doubtful),* with a view to the introduction of a general Land Law, and by passing an Act (No. XX of 1837) which modifies, in the Straits, the English law of succession and makes all immoveable property descend to the executor or administrator and not to the heir.\u2020 In the same year a Commissioner (Mr. Young) was despatched from India to the Straits Settlements to settle existing disputes and difficulties about titles to land and to report on the whole subject. He visited Malacca in 1838, and again there was an opportunity of putting the land revenue system on an intelligible basis, either by ascertaining, and formally enacting as law, the native customs relative to the collection of the tenth (as was done in Ceylon a few years later \u2021), or by establishing by law the principle of an assessment in money, instead of the tax in kind, to be levied on the cultivated area as in India.\n\nMr. Young recommended neither. He deprecated legislation, and preferred to trust (the result has shewn how vainly) to argument and persuasion to induce the Malays to commute the tithe for a fixed annual payment in money. The idea started in Regulation IX of 1830, that each cultivator was to have a title-deed for his holding, seems to have taken complete possession of that generation of Land Revenue officials and the object of every succeeding administration seems similarly to have been to force documents of title upon an unwilling population. The toll-houses were discontinued and the voluntary commutation plan was tried. Its complete failure was thus described by Mr. E. A. Blundell in 1848:\n\n---\n\n* Act X of 1837, s. 1.\n\u2020 See Sir B. Malkin's letter to the Government of India, dated July 17, 1837; Report of Indian Land Commissioners, p. 85.\n\u2021 Sup., p. 145.\n\"He (Mr. Young) seems to have brought to notice the very objectionable system of levying a revenue in kind on the produce of the lands, and to have induced the resort to a commutation of the tenths into a money payment, but unfortunately the mode adopted either by or through him, was one that proved most unpalatable to the natives of the place, and by its enforcement led to much vexation and dissatisfaction. This novel mode of raising a land revenue was by means of technical English legal indentures between the tenants and the East India Company, drawn up with all the precision and formality of a practising attorney in England, whereby the tenant engages to pay so much per annum, and the East India Company engages not to demand any more, during a period of twenty years from the date of signing. This legal document occupies the whole of one side of a sheet of foolscap, while the other is filled with Malayan writing purporting to be a translation of the English, but, as may well be supposed, failing entirely to convey to a native reader any idea of its meaning. It requires some knowledge of law to understand the English original, considering that it is drawn up in strictly legal terms, and the attempt to translate those terms into Malay has produced an utterly unintelligible jumble of words. Indentures being duplicate documents are of course required to be signed, sealed and delivered in duplicate by each party in the presence of witnesses. To secure therefore the payment (often of a few annas only per annum) the tenants (ignorant Malay peasants) were sent for in shoals to put their marks to these sheets of foolscap paper filled with writing. They naturally got alarmed and evinced the greatest reluctance to affix their signature. To overcome this reluctance and to induce a general signing throughout, seems to have been the great and almost sole object of the Land Department from that time to the present. All the ingenuity of Residents and Assistants has been exerted to this end and all the principles of political economy have been exhausted in endeavouring to explain the advantages of the system, but in many parts without success. Threats, coaxings and explanations have been set at defiance, and an obstinate determi-\nnation evinced not to sign these legal papers. In 1843 or\n1844, the then Resident hit on the notable plan of punishing\nthe recusants for their contumacy by putting their tenths up\nto auction and selling them to a Chinaman, the very thing\nthat formed one of the grounds for redeeming the lands from\nthe proprietors!\"\n\nThe Government had redeemed the rights granted in the\ndays of Dutch rule to a few privileged \"proprietors\" and the\nworst that was said of the bargain for some years was that it\nhad been rashly and improvidently concluded and had resulted\nin an annual loss to Government. But as time went on it was\ndiscovered that the Government had by no means acquired, as\nhad been supposed, an unfettered right to deal with the waste\nland of Malacca. The deeds by which the \"proprietors\"\nsurrendered their rights to Government contained a stipula-\ntion to the effect that, in case the Settlement of Malacca should\never be given up to any other Power, they should be restored\nto their original position with respect to the lands.* This\nproviso effectually prevented the Government from giving a\nclean title to purchasers.\n\nThe legal difficulty thus engendered, and the acknowledged\nfailure of the voluntary commutation plan, necessitated refer-\nence once more to the Government of India, and in 1861 a\nBill was introduced in the Legislative Council of India, which,\nit was hoped, would give the local authorities all the necessary\npowers. During a debate on this measure, the law officer of\nthe Government (Mr. Sconce) read to the Council an extract\nfrom a letter written by Mr. Blundell, ex-Governor of the\nStraits Settlements, in which the injurious effect of the exac-\ntion of the tenth in kind was pointed out. He further\nexplained that twenty years earlier an attempt had been\nmade to commute the payment in kind to a money payment,\nwhich had failed \"from the bad way in which it was carried\nout,\" and that many disputes had arisen from the ineffici-\nency of the native surveyors, \"whose surveys were so bad\nthat constant disputes were arising in consequence of them,\nmany lands having been assigned twice over.\" To meet\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., X, 60-61.\nthis difficulty the Bill provided for a survey and a summary settlement of the rights of parties, \"which would put an end to disputes.\"*\n\nThe Bill in due time became law and, as Act XXVI of 1861, is still in force in the Colony. It settled summarily all difficulties as to the title of the Government to the lands over which the Dutch grantees had once had rights, by vesting the lands in question in fee simple in Her Majesty and thus forever extinguished any hopes which the former grantees might have entertained of regaining possession, at some future time, of the surrendered rights.\n\nIt also declared what was the legal status of certain classes of native land-holders and provided a scheme of survey and settlement, analogous to the Indian system, under which the rights and liabilities of every one could be ascertained and recorded.\n\nBut thirty years had been lost and the lands taken up with or without authority in that period were now not to be distinguished from the lands which were held under the local customary tenure at the time when Regulation IX of 1830 was passed.\u2020 The duty to be undertaken was a completely new survey of the Settlement of Malacca, in the course of which the status of every person claiming to have title to land was to be ascertained and declared; and this was not facilitated by any earlier survey and settlement, for the provisions of Regulations IX of 1830 in this respect had been allowed to remain a dead letter,\u2021\n\nThe Act contemplated (s. 1) two classes of native land-holders, namely, (1) \"cultivators and resident tenants\" of the lands redeemed from the Dutch grantees, and of lands in Naning \"who hold their lands by prescription;\" \u00a7\n\n(2) \"All other cultivators and under-tenants who now occupy or hold, or shall occupy or hold, any of such lands as aforesaid.\" Those who could prove a proprietary right under\n\n* Bengal Hurkaru, January 19th, 1861.\n\u2020 See p. 151.\n\u2021 See supra, p. 154, note.*\n\u00a7 i.e., by local custom, usage or law, Suhrip v. Mitchell, Appendix III, p. xli.\nthe local customary tenure, and who came, therefore within the first category, were declared to be liable to a payment, either in money or kind, of one-tenth part of the produce of the land to Government.\n\nThose (class 2), whose occupation was independent of the native customary tenure were to be treated as squatters under the Straits Land Act (Act XVI of 1839, s 2) and had the alternative of \"engaging for\" their land on terms fixed by the Government, or of removing from it altogether.\n\nPower was given to the Governor to commute the customary liability of a land-holder to pay tenths in kind, for a sum down and an annual quit-rent.\n\nWaste land at the disposal of Government was to be alienated, in the discretion of the Governor, to applicants, in perpetuity or for any term of years and subject to any quit-rent agreed upon; and the local customary right, which the peasantry of Malacca possessed, of taking up forest, waste or uncultivated land and acquiring a proprietary right over it by clearing and cultivating it, was taken away. Every land-holder was, however, declared to be entitled to add to his holding by engaging for contiguous uncultivated land in the proportion of one part of waste for every four parts of land cultivated by him.\n\nFinally, certain legal powers were given to officials to be appointed by the Governor, to make a survey of the lands of the Settlement, to require the attendance of parties and the production of documents, and to enquire into and decide questions of title, subject to an appeal to the Court of Judicature.\n\nIf this Act had been properly worked by a sufficient establishment, there would seem to be no reason why the Malacca Land Revenue Department should not be at the present time, as regards survey, settlement, maps, registration of holdings, and record of rights, on as satisfactory a footing as any settled district in an Indian province.\n\nBut no settlement operations on a sufficiently extended scale were ever undertaken. A surveyor was appointed and worked for some years during which time a tolerable survey of the coast districts (about one-fourth of the whole) was executed. The\nmaps so obtained were never published and the Indian system of declaring particular land to be liable for so much revenue annually, leivable quite irrespective of any title-deed delivered to the occupant, was not enforced by the Land Office, though this is distinctly what the Act aimed at. The officials of the day seem to have been still unable to get rid of the idea that the only way to make an occupant liable for land revenue was to make him sign a lease first of all.\n\nIn the words of the late Attorney-General of this Colony (Mr. T. Braddell, C.M.G.), whose paper on the Malacca Land History* has been of the greatest value to me in compiling these notes,\u2014\u201cthe cultivators, finding themselves better off under the Penghulus, with whom (when they had no written titles registered in the office, and followed by regular demands for the rent expressed in the title-deed) they were able to evade payment of the tenths, still refused to take titles, and continued to occupy old lands and to open up other lands with impunity, owing to the weakness of the Land Department, which was provided with so few, and such inefficient officers, that there was no regular supervision, and when any person was found encroaching on the Crown lands he was all ready with the excuse that the land was prescriptive tenant land.\u201d\u2020\n\nSystematic work in Malacca under Act XXVI of 1861 ceased with the departure of Surveyor-General Quinton from that Settlement, about 1867.\n\nA passing reference may here be made to Ordinance XI of 1876, intended to facilitate land-administration in Malacca, which has remained more or less a dead-letter for want of an efficient establishment.\u2021\n\nNeither Act XXVI of 1861, nor the Ordinance last quoted, touch on a subject which has attracted the attention of several persons who have written upon Malacca Lands. It has been stated above (p. 153) that owing to absence from the Settlement, or incapacity to contract, on the part of the persons entitled, the right of collecting the tenth was not redeemed\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., N.S., I, 43.\n\u2020 Proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements, 1882, p. 68.\n\u2021 Id.\nby Government in all cases and that this right is still enjoyed by a few individuals in Malacca. Blundell speaks of the omission to carry out the redemption policy in these few instances (which of course ought to have been dealt with as soon as the exceptional circumstances alluded to ceased), as an \"important error,\" but describes the unredeemed lands as \"so small in extent (probably not one-tenth of the whole), \" and already (1848) so far occupied, as to preclude their being selected for any extensive cultivation\" by a new colonist prospecting for agricultural land.*\n\nThe plan proposed by Mr. W. R. Young, in 1838, of providing by a special Act for the resumption by the State of the privileges held by the few remaining tithe-impropriators, upon the award of compensation on an equitable principle, has not yet been acted upon. Perhaps the limited area of the land in question, which, he states, \"does not exceed in area four or five square miles,\" was thought to characterise the matter as one of not sufficient importance to demand special legislation in Calcutta. Mr. Young's remarks and recommendations are as follows:\u2014\n\n\"I must here mention that although the great bulk of the impropriators transferred their rights to the Government in 1828, a few of them were not included in Mr. Fullerton's arrangement, either by reason of the absence from Malacca of the principals, at the time of the negotiation, or because some of the tithe-owners had sub-let their privileges to others for a term of years, and the derivative interests thus created stood in the way of the admission of those impro priators into the scheme of adjustment. The land thus excluded from the general arrangement does not exceed in area four or five square miles, and I believe that the impro priators would be quite willing to surrender their privileges to the Government in consideration of receiving compensation on the principle which was applied to the cases of the other tithe-owners. I think it would be desirable, for the sake of uniformity, to extend the arrangement to these par ties, although the land in question is not sufficiently exten-\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 743, 744.\n\u2020 Correspondence relating to the Land Revenue System of the Straits Settlements, 1837-1844, para. 40, p. 69.\nsive to offer any important obstruction to the satisfactory working of the new system as a whole. The position of the lands referred to, their limited area, and the facility of obtaining correct information respecting their produce and value, would obviate all risk of a recurrence, in relation to them, of the miscalculations or deceptions which have rendered the existing composition with the tithe-owners so bad a bargain to the State. If, however, these impropiators should be unwilling to assent to an equitable arrangement with the State for the surrender of their rights\u2014the terms of which might be settled by arbitrators\u2014and if Government should be of opinion that the retention, in hands of a few individuals of privileges, the reservation of which, even to the ruling authority, has been declared to be incompatible with the good of the country, would militate against the beneficial working of the new plan\u2014there would be neither injustice nor difficulty in providing by law for the transfer of those privileges to the State, with a view to the perfection of the commutation arrangement, compensation, on an equitable principle being of course awarded to the parties whose interests may be affected by the transfer. A measure of this sort would, I have no doubt, be acceptable to the tithe-payers, who will soon find themselves in a more unfavourable position than their neighbours who have assented to the commutation, and, indeed, there is little reason to suppose that the tithe-owners would object to a fair adjustment. Perhaps it would be advisable that Government should direct the local authorities to negotiate with the impropiators in question for the surrender of their rights to tithes, and to report the result for the approval or further instructions of the Supreme Government.\"\n\nA good deal has been said lately about \"British Malaya,\" under which term those who favour a policy of extending our territory on the Malay Peninsula, by annexation, would include the Straits Settlements, and at least those Native States which are now under our direct protectorate (Perak, Salangor and Sungei Ujong). A word, therefore, may here be added as to the lessons to be learnt from the history of the land-laws\napplied during the last sixty years to the only Malay State which has yet become British territory.\n\nIn Malacca, the native system of land tenure and revenue has never been properly ascertained and put into the shape of an Act. It has always been, therefore, and still is, more or less unworkable under English law.\n\nThe lands held under the native tenure at the time of cession were not identified and registered, and though a new system of tenure under English grants and leases was introduced, the old native system went on extending itself side by side with the new one.\n\nWhen, in 1861, it was declared to be the intention of Government to put a stop to the native system of acquiring a proprietary right by occupation, the holdings then existing were not ascertained by a visitation or survey.\n\nSo, though the native revenue system cannot be satisfactorily worked, for want of power to exact the tenth, the officials have been unable to oblige the people to adopt the English tenure, because lands, really only recently brought under cultivation, cannot always be proved not to be old holdings under the native tenure.\n\nThe experience of other British possessions in the East conclusively shews that the wisest way to organise the collection of land revenue in an Asiatic country is to adopt and extend the native system, to work it through responsible trained officers charged with the care of separate tracts and living in their districts, to create a revenue side of every District Officer's Court and to have nothing to do with English law.\n\nThis paper, which has grown to unexpected proportions, may now fitly end with a final quotation from an official report:\n\n\"It would be well if in the Protected States the history of Malacca tenures were taken as a warning, and if an early opportunity were taken of ascertaining the rights of native cultivators and land-holders and securing to them their full enjoyment, while laying down any modifications of the native law which may be decided on as to the future. If something of this kind is not done, the modern clearing will be undistinguishable from the ancient holding and land will continue to...\"\n\"be occupied and acquired on a system which it is difficult to\n\"assimilate with any satisfactory land revenue scheme.\"*\n\nW.

Jews certainly had none before their expulsion by Edward I. Regulations were made for their government, and they were ultimately banished from the realm by the sole authority of the Crown; and they are expressly called the King's serfs in contemporary documents.

Ye must not suffer the former owners to dispute possession, for the field has gone back to God, and custom declares that there shall be no such dispute.\nPada menyata-kan hukum tanah per-huma-an atau bendang ada-pun tanah itu atas dua bahagi suatu tanah hidop ka-dua tanah mati ada-pun tanah mati itu tiada tanda \u2018alamat sa-suatu siapa yang punia hak karana yang punia dusun itu handak-kan hasil naschaya tiada-lah lagi per-kata-an-nia pada tanah itu maka jika di-per-buat uleh sa-sa\u2019orang huma atau sawah bendang maka tiada-lah dapat barang siapa ber-kata-kata lagi karana sudah di-suka-kan yang punia dusun ada-pun yang ber-nama tanah hidop itu di-duduk-i orang di-tanam-i pokok kayu-kayu-an dan buah-buah-an serta di-per-buat-nia kampong halaman tampat itu maka tiada-lah buleh di-ambil uleh sa-sa\u2019orang itu-lah di-nama-i tanah hidop dan damikian lagi sagala orang yang duduk di-dalam tanah orang atau dusun orang maka handak-lah dia meng-ikut parentah dan jika dia me-lawan kapada yang ampunia tanah atau dusun atau yang di-tuan-kan-nia maka di-hukum sa-puloh talih sa-paha.

Land for these purposes is of two kinds, the first is tanah hidop, (live land), and the second is tanah mati (dead land). Tanah mati is that on which there is no sign or token that it has been appropriated by any one, or any grove of fruit-trees in respect of which a proprietor can demand a payment. Regarding such land it is certain that there can be no question. If any person proceeds to plant upland or wet padi on such land, no one has any right to dispute it with him for it has been abandoned voluntarily by its former owner.\n\nLand which is known as tanah hidop is that which is appropriated by some one, either by living on it or by planting timber or fruit-trees or by laying out a garden or enclosure. This cannot be taken by anyone and is called tanah hidop. This rule applies also to persons who settle on the lands or plantations of others. As long as they live there, they must obey the orders of the owner, and if they oppose him, they may be fined ten tahils and one paha.* It is the duty of all the persons who live on the land to support and co-operate with their lord, a rule which is also laid down in the Hukum Kanun.\u2020\n\nIf a person plants an orchard (on the land of another) and his trees grow up successfully, and a complaint is lodged by the owner of the land, the value of the land shall be divided into three equal parts, one third shall be paid to the owner of the land, and\n\n* 1 tahil = $8.\n\u2020 A separate Code.

The same is the rule in the case of rice-fields, laid out by a person on the land of another. But if a man makes a clearing [for a farm of upland padi and vegetables] on the waste land of another without the knowledge and consent of the latter, who thereupon complains, the owner of the land shall get it and if the trespasser persists, he shall be fined ten amas.*\n\nIf the land is left by the cultivator, and another comes and makes a plantation thereon, or otherwise cultivates on it, the latter shall be fined by the judge one tahil and one paha for he has forcibly encroached upon the rights of another. If it is the owner of the land who does this, there is, of course, nothing to be said. Such is the law regarding tanah hidop, and it is firmly established and followed both in towns and in the country and in all districts and divisions of the State.\n\n[Huma or Ladang land.

And if the persons interested in the clearing set up a fence round it, and, though most of them fence their respective portions, one person neglects to do so, this is no offence; but if, owing to such neglect, the crops of the others are eaten by pigs or buffaloes, he shall make good the loss, for it was by his neglect in not fencing that it occurred, and if the whole crop is devoured by animals the same law is to be observed.\n\n[Obligation to fence. Cattle-trespass. Perak Code.]\n\nTo declare the customary law regarding the duties of the owners of growing crops. Ye must all have fences and ditches [round your holdings] and must not neglect to watch them.*\n\nGrowing crops are of two kinds. First, those which are fenced in. In the case of these, if a buffalo or ox effects an entry and be stabbed at night [by the owner of the crop or his people], the latter must make good half of the value of the beast. But according to another sound doctrine, the full value of the beast must be made good (by the crop-owner) and the value of the damaged crop must be made good by the owner of the beast.\n\n* \"The prevalence of this practice (the enclosure of cattle in fences), and the care with which fencing is universally attended to, is the best evidence of the value set upon land by a dense population. Their perception of the rights of property, and their desire to maintain and respect them, are amply attested by their many arrangements to restrain the trespass of cattle. On the other hand, one of the most serious annoyances with which the planters of the South have had to contend, both on their Coffee and Sugar Estates arises from the notorious indifference of the Kandyans and Singhalese in this particular, and their disregard of all precautions for securing their buffaloes and bullocks by day or by night.\" TENNENT's \"Ceylon,\" II, 532.\nKa-dua tanam-an itu tiada ber-pagar jika di-tikam pada malam menyilih samua-nia yang ampunia tanam-an itu dan tiada-lah di-silih-nia uleh yang ampunia benatang akan tanam-an itu.\n\nJikalau siang ter-tikam sa-pulang-dua hukum-nia melain-kan jikalau sudah masahur jahat-nia kerbau itu sa-hingga menyilih sa-belah harga-nia jaga dan tanam-an itu di-silih pula uleh yang ampunia kerbau.\n\nPada menyata-kan hukum buah-buah-an di-dalam kam-pong orang atau di-dalam kota negri ada-pun jika tiada iya mem-bahagi-kan buah itu akan tuan-nia di-makan-nia ber-sama-sama jikalau di-jual-nia buah-nia itu maka di-pinta harga-nia sa-per-tiga dua bahagi pada ampunia kampong sa-bahagi akan tuan-nia lama dan jika iyatiada mahu mem-beri maka marah iya lalu di-tebang-nia pokok itu maka meng-adap ampunia pada hakim maka di-suroh hakim bayar harga-nia pokok itu bagei-mana \u2018adat sagala pokok kayu-kayu-an yang di-dalam kam-pong orang di-akan sagala buah-buah-an itu pun mana \u2018adat-nia yang sa-per-tiga juga dan jikalau di-jual-nia uleh ampunia kampong itu dapat di-d\u2019awa-nia uleh yang ampunia lama me-\nThe second kind of growing crop is that which is not fenced in. In the case of land of this kind, the value of a beast stabbed at night in the act of trespassing must be made good in full by the owner of the crop, and there is no obligation upon the owner of the beast to make good the value of the damage done by it.\n\nShould a beast be stabbed [trespassing] in daylight, the rule is that twice its value must be paid, except in the case of a notoriously vicious buffalo,* only one-half of the value of which need be paid, and the owner of which must make good the damage to the crop.\n\n[Superior and Inferior Rights. Malacca Code.]\n\nTo declare the law regarding the fruit of trees growing in the kampong of another or in the capital town, if the proprietor (of the trees) does not give a share of such fruit to the owner of the land, so that they may enjoy it in common, but on the contrary sells such fruit (for his own benefit), one-third of the value thereof may be demanded, that is to say, two shares go to the proprietor of the kampong and one share to the owner of the land. If the former will not give it, but in his anger cuts down the trees and the land-owner presents himself before the judge for redress, the judge must order the value of the trees to be paid in accordance with the customary price of all fruit-trees growing in the kampong of others, and in like manner fruit must be appraised, the above custom of dividing in thirds being observed, and if it is sold by the proprietor of the kampong the owner of the ancient right to the land has the right to sue.\n\n* Compare the rule of English law as to animals of a known vicious disposition.

Regarding the Bandahara and Chiefs, however, if one of them grants a kampong to a person and nothing is known of it by the Raja until the case of the cultivating-proprietor is represented to him, or if any Chief takes the kampong or dusun of any person and grants it to another and the proprietor represents the matter to the Raja and the Raja confirms the grant, the proprietor of the kampong has no further cause of action, for the thing has been done with the knowledge of the Raja. The end.\n\n[Hypothecation of Land. Recovery of Land, &c., wrongfully taken. Malacca Code.]\n\nTo declare the law regarding the hypothecation of dusuns (groves of fruit-trees). Now hypothecation is of two kinds, the first is harus (\"lawful\"), the second is ganda harus (\"lawful to double\").\n\nIf a man hypothecates a dusun (grove of fruit-trees) or a kampong planted with fruit-trees to the Raja, and the trees do not bear fruit while in the possession of the bailee during the whole time of his possession, even though he wait for years, the creditor may claim double his money.\n\nProperty in respect of which this doubling cannot take place is a grove of cocoa-nut or betel-nut or other similar trees. The law is that ganda does not apply to these, and should the creditor claim it, in-\nnia hukum-nia dan jika di-ganda-kan maka di-b\u00e9ri tahu ka-\npada hakim maka hakim-lah jadi lawan-nia jika iya men-dapat\nbarang sa-bagei-nia benda yang ghraib kapada kampong orang\nyang di-pegang-kan-nia itu di-bahagi sa-per-tiga \u2018adat dan\nsa-bahagi pada yang memegang gadei itu dua bahagi pada\nampunia karana lagi iya menunggu di-tampat itu dan dami-\nkian lagi kampong yang di-anugraha akan orang besar-besar\njikalau iya men-dapat sa-suatu pen-dapat-an di-bahagi dua pada\nyang ampunia sa-bahagi dan kapada yang men-dapat sa-\nbahagi damikian-lah hukum-nia ada-pun hukum dusun dua\nbahagi uleh sa\u2019orang yang tiada ber-hutang maka di-makan-\nnia buah-nia dan di-jual-nia maka datang tuan-nia buleh di-\nd\u2019a-wa-nia dan damikian lagi segala orang yang di-murka-i uleh\nraja-raja maka lari iya pada negri lain sebab takut-nia.

If the creditor finds any concealed property of value upon the land of the debtor which is held by him in hypothecation, the custom is that it shall be divided in three equal shares, one of which shall go to the holder of the mortgaged land, and two to the proprietor, for the finding has taken place while the creditor is in possession of the land. The same principle applies to land bestowed by the Raja upon Chiefs. If anything is found thereon, it must be divided in two equal shares, one of which goes to the owner of the land and the other to the finder. This is the law.\n\nNow regarding dusun there are two regulations, first in the case of a man to whom no debt is due, but he nevertheless eats the fruit of the dusun and sells it; in such a case, if the owner appears, he has a right of action. So in the case of persons who have incurred the displeasure of their Rajas and flee to other countries out of fear for their safety, abandoning heir dusun or kampong, which are forthwith taken by others. In their case also, the rightful owners may sue in after days, for the property is theirs and shall certainly be restored to them by the judge. The end.\n\n[Sub-letting. A stated rent necessary.

Perak Code.]\n\nThe law affecting the tenants of houses. If the house is destroyed by the fault of the tenant he must make good its value.\n\nShould the tenant desire to put an end to the agreement, he may demand that a proportionate part of the rent shall be returned to him. For instance, a man rents a house on the undertaking that he shall pay one hundred catties of tin for ten months; he resides there for one month, and then the house falls down, or is otherwise destroyed; in this case, ten catties of tin must be allowed for the one month of occupation, and he may demand that the remaining ninety catties shall be returned to him. If he likes to continue to live in that house, he can call upon the owner to repair it for him, for he has paid in advance.\n\nThe case may be put, \"if the rent has not been paid beforehand what will the law be?\" The answer is, at the time that he refuses to live in the house any longer, he must pay rent for the term that has already expired; or if he still desires to go on living in the place, he may call on the owner to repair and must pay all rent which subsequently becomes due.\nPri hukum benda yang sakutu bumi dan sagala per-buat-an dan sagala pohon kayu meng-ikut bumi itu.\n\nBer-mula apa-bila di-jual-nia uleh sa\u2019orang deri-pada dua itu akan benda yang sakutu itu kepada orang lain.

MALACCA LANDS.\n\nTuesday, 10th October, 1826.\n\nThe following European and Native Landed Proprietors were assembled this day at the Resident Councillor's Office for the purpose of enquiring into the particulars detailed below:\n\nB. De Wind, Esq.\nJ. B. Westerhout, Esq.\nG. Koek, Esq.\nA. Velge, Esq.\n\nThe Captain of Malays:\n\nAroom\nMahmat Tyre,\nLoerien,\nBooro,\n\nInchis.\n\nM. de Souza was present by proxy in the person of his son.\n\nMessrs. De Wit, D. Koek, and G. de Souza, the Captain Kling and Dosso Bindasa were requested to attend, but unavoidable circumstances detained them elsewhere.\n\nThe above meeting took place for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of the agreement subsisting respectively between the Government, the landed proprietors, the Penghulus (or intermediate officers between the landed proprietors and the tenants), and the immediate cultivators of the soil.\n\n1.\u2014Between the Government and the landed proprietors.\n\nOn a reference to the records in the Registrar's Office, it would appear that some grants expressly state the right of Government to resume the land, and all, so far as the inquiry has gone, seem to indicate an ultimate right of this nature.\n\nThe grantee, by the records, is generally supposed to receive the land under an engagement of clearing the same of jungle, and the right of resumption on the part of Government would seem to arise from the non-fulfilment of this expressed or implied duty on the part of the grantee.\n\nIn regard to this clause, implied or seemingly understood in favour of Government, the present proprietors state that, without\nquestioning the absolute right of Government on this point, they consider themselves as possessing in equity a full and inviolate title to their grounds, inasmuch as the land has been sold to, and handed over during a series of years to various individuals without any mention being made of such inherent reservation affecting their title. On being required to produce their title deeds and grants, the present landed proprietors can only show Bills of Sale. They state that all sales or transfers of land were made in the Court of Justice, which body detained all previous papers and deeds on delivering up the last Bill of Sale or Transfer, and that the Court did not intimate to them the reservation above, to which it was their duty to do, if such a right be recognised on the part of Government.\n\nThe proprietors acknowledge that they consider themselves bound, on the requisition of Government, to keep in repair all established bridges and roads running through the grounds, and to clean the banks and body of the river bordering on their estates from nuisances. But that all new roads are to be constructed at the expense of Government, who can carry such roads through any part of an estate, after intimating their intention to the immediate proprietors of the soil.\n\nThe proprietors acknowledge also, that in cases of emergency (if any such should occur), they are bound to provide for the peace of their respective estates by embodying a police from among their tenants.\n\n2.\u2014Between the landed proprietors and the Penghulus.\n\nThe appointment of Penghulus is not obligatory, but is left to the free will of the proprietor, being solely for his own convenience. On small estates there may be no intermediate officer. On estates somewhat larger, but possessing a paucity of tenants, there may be a mata-mata, who, under a more modest designation, is de facto a Penghulu, both in power and privilege. On estates possessing 15 or 20 houses, there is usually a Penghulu appointed. On extensive estates, there are several Penghulus, one being generally appointed for each respective quarter of an estate, which may incorporate parcels of ground of different names.\n\nThe Penghulu and Mata-mata are exempted from any tax or assessment on their property, and are supposed to settle all disputes of minor importance subsisting among the tenants. But this is by simple compromise, as they possess no judicial powers. They pay regard to the tranquillity of the estate, and are the medium of communication between the landed proprietors and the tenants.\nThe Penghulus are not Government Officers in any sense of the term, and prior to the British authority receiving over Malacca on 9th April, 1825, Government did not, in any respect, interfere with them. Since that period, the Penghulus have been compelled to appear in Court, to take an oath for correctly exercising their authority.\n\n3.\u2014Between the landed proprietors and the tenants.\n\nThe tenant settles on an estate by the verbal permission of the proprietor. There is no express law as to the rate of rent payable, but the custom in general is for the landlord to receive 10 per cent. upon all the produce of the soil, although, in some particular instances, so low as 6 per cent. has been accepted by way of encouragement. When spices or pepper are to be planted, there is usually a separate and sometimes a written engagement made, and no tithe is levied for the first 3 or 4 years.\n\nDuring the Dutch administration, the inhabitants were not permitted to cultivate padi, and the produce of the estate consisted chiefly in fruits, wood and charcoal. Padi cultivation is however now extending in all parts. The tithe of padi, spices and pepper is usually received at the residence or stores of the cultivators, and in most cases this tithe is taken by estimation rather than by absolute measurement, which is found to be inconvenient. But the tithe of other articles is generally received in cash, after the same have been disposed of, and in case of apparent fraud, the sale must be traced, in order to ascertain the truth or error of such a suspicion. The land-holder possesses no right to establish his own mode of assessment or revenue, whether as to time, or place, or rate. In the collection of these tithes, some proprietors farm out their revenues, and others receive them through their own agents.\n\nA tenant may sell, transfer, devise, &c. the portions of land he may cultivate, and he is free to cultivate the soil to any extent. He may quit the estate at his free pleasure. But the land-holder cannot force him off the estate without just cause of offence. When this exists, a proper time must be granted to the tenant to enable him to dispose of his property.\n\nIf such tenant appears dilatory in effecting his arrangements, the land-holder may assemble the Penghulus and elderly people as a committee of appraisement, and the land-holder paying the amount according to their estimate, can oblige the tenant to quit the estate.\n\nIf the tenant feels aggrieved with the conduct or the judgment of the Penghulu, he is to apply to his landlord, and in all cases,\nwithout exception, where disputes or differences of opinion may subsist between the tenant and his landlord, which cannot otherwise be compromised, the appeal lies to Government.\n\nWednesday, 11th October, 1826.\n\nAs the nature of the landed tenures, so far as respects the relative right of Government and the landed proprietors, remains involved in some obscurity, the following order was issued, and it is believed that the question at issue will be satisfactorily elucidated when the Register required in this order may be completed.\n\nWith a view to ascertain the precise nature of the landed tenures, so as to complete the information which was yesterday elucidated at a meeting of the principal landed proprietors, the Dutch Translator is requested to examine the records in the office of the Registrar, who is to assist in the said enquiry, and extract from thence the particulars necessary to fill up an Abstract Registry of the following form:\n\n**Abstract Registry of the Grants of Land made by Government from the earliest periods to the Inhabitants of Malacca.**\n\n| No. | Date of Grant. | Names of Grantee. | Names and Extent of Land granted. | Resumption by the Letter. | Resumption not stated. | Right of Resumption cut off by Letter. | Dates and Impositions. | Remarks |\n|-----|---------------|------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------|\n\nThe Land Surveyor will also draw up a draft of the Territory of Malacca, grounded upon the map in the Resident's office. In this draft, the Land Surveyor will trace, in double lines, the several divisions according to the original grants of Government and with Roman letters will refer to the foot of the map, or to an appended Schedule, exhibiting the dates of the original grants, names of the grantees, and other particulars as set forth in the Register to be completed by the Dutch Translator as above directed. The Land\nSurveyor will then trace off, with colours only, the present distribution of territory, using numbers, in lieu of Roman letters, for references as above.\n\nAs this Register and the map are to be submitted to the Hon'ble the Governor, the period of whose arrival is very uncertain, the Dutch Translator and Land Surveyor are requested to exercise such practicable expedition as may be compatible with a clean elucidation of the points in question.\n\nExtract from a Minute by Mr. Fullerton, Governor of the Straits Settlements, dated the 24th of November, 1827.\n\nAll the papers connected with Lands of Malacca being under preparation for transmission to Bengal, I now record a minute to accompany them, being an abstract of past transactions in that department.\n\nThe Lands of Malacca extend along the coast of the Malay Peninsula 39 miles, their greatest breadth inland, without including Naning, 28 miles, containing square miles 654, or acres 418,560. Of this, 500 square miles, or acres 320,000, are capable of wet rice cultivation, and of which 500 acres are now supplied to be actually cultivated. Of the dry lands, acres 10,000 may be supposed to be planted with fruit trees, or in gardens, acres 88,560 waste and covered with forest.\n\nThe whole of the lands appeared to have been assigned over to certain of the inhabitants nearly one hundred years ago. On first enquiry and examination of the deeds held by the present proprietors as they were called, descendants of the first grantees, the Government were led to view them as absolute proprietors and owners of the soil at full liberty to rent and derive the utmost advantage from them. On a further enquiry, however, and the examination of the Dutch records, it was found that only the Government right of levying from the resident inhabitants a tenth of the produce had been granted to them, and Proclamations were discovered interdicting, under heavy penalties, the demand of any rent or tax beyond the tenth of the produce. The persons thus investing with the Government right, it appeared, took little pains to encourage or extend the cultivation. Residing at Malacca and never quitting the town, the right of levying the tax was sold annually to certain Chinese inhabitants, who appear to have exercised over the inhabitants the right of compulsory labour and a\ndegree of power inconsistent with the improvement of the country. In reality, as the exercise of Police functions seems to have been a part of the tenure, the whole authority over the country rested with a few Chinese contractors. In order to open to Government the means of direct management of the lands with a view of encouraging and extending cultivation, as well as maintaining due control over the inhabitants, the redemption of the Government right to the tenth from the persons called proprietors presented itself as a most desirable measure. The collections having been rented, and the renters supposed to gain considerably, it was calculated that, by agreeing to pay to the proprietors a sum, even a little exceeding that received by them at present, little, if any, immediate loss would be sustained, and the Government would, besides the levy of the tenth on the lands actually occupied, be entitled to dispose of the waste and derive a growing revenue from the gradual extension of cultivation and increase of produce, to a portion of which they would be entitled. A settlement was accordingly made with the proprietors, whereby Government agree to pay annually according to the list. In consideration of which, the proprietors agreed to make over to Government all right derived from previous grants given by the preceding Government, surrendering all such as were in their possession.

The investigations requisite for the adjustment of the landed tenures at Malacca have, we are happy to see, been satisfactorily performed, and the adjustment itself completed. The following are the points which have been ascertained:\n\n1st.\u2014That the pecuniary claim of Government upon the soil, by the custom of the place, and of the neighbouring Malay States, amounted to one tenth of the produce.\n\n2ndly.\u2014That the persons called the proprietors, mostly Dutch colonists resident at Malacca, were merely persons to whom Government had granted out its tenth, and who had no other claims upon the produce, nor upon the occupiers, not founded in abuse.\n\n3rdly.\u2014That the occupiers, therefore, were the real proprietors of the soil.\n\n4thly.\u2014That the Panghooloos were merely the Agents of Government, or of the persons called the proprietors, for collecting the tenth share, and performing certain duties of the nature of Police, attached by custom to the proprietorship.\n\n157. We are extremely glad that you have been able to effect, with the body of proprietors, an arrangement whereby they make over to you the whole of their rights, for the fixed annual payment, about equal to the present amount of their annual receipts. You propose to manage the lands directly on account of Government, employing the Panghooloos as Collectors and Police Officers. They are probably the most efficient instruments whom, in the present state of society at Malacca, you have it in your power to employ. They will, however, require a vigilant superintendence, and the more so since the administration of justice, as at present organised, does not afford to the cultivators so accessible or expeditious a means of redress in case of their sustaining any injury, as to dispense with the necessity of other securities.\n\n158. You have reserved, as the privilege of Government, the absolute disposal of all lands hitherto unreclaimed, or which hereafter be suffered to run again into forest and remain unproductive for five years.\n\n159. The limits of all lands occupied by individuals are to be, as soon as possible, determined by survey, and defined by Grants duly issued and registered. All future transfers of landed proper-\nty are likewise to be registered; all these arrangements are highly proper.\n\n160. You have prepared a \"Regulation for declaring the rights of the Government over the lands within the territories of Malacca and providing for the due collection of the Government share of the produce thereof.\" This Regulation, consisting of thirteen paragraphs, you have transmitted for the sanction of the home authorities. We have already separately expressed to you our approbation of most of the arrangements to which this Ordinance is intended to give effect. We have now to add, that it is worded with remarkable clearness and precision and the rights of Government and of the occupiers are exactly and at the same time concisely defined. We, therefore, in conformity with the provisions of the Act 53 Geo. III Chap. 155, hereby sanction, with the approbation of the Commissioners for the Affairs of India, the draft as a Regulation which you have submitted to us, and of which we have already transcribed the title; and we direct this Regulation be promulgated and enforced, on the receipt of this despatch.\n\nA. M. BOND,\nAssistant Resident.\n\nExtract from a Minute by Mr. Fullerton, dated the 29th January, 1828.\n\nIn my minute of the 5th July, 1827, I entered into the consideration of the land tenures, but rather to record the apparent contradiction in terms or incompatibility of a supposed ownership of land with a right of levying no more than 10 per cent. of the produce, or without that of forbidding the occupancy of land except under such term as might be agreed on between parties. The main and express object of that minute was to excite further enquiries and draw forth further information on the subject apparently little understood. Mr. Lewis has now made a further report, and has submitted two documents out of the records which lend to throw much light on the whole subject. I allude to the order issued by the Dutch Government in the year 1819 referring to one of 1773. These documents render clear the terms and understanding under which the persons denominated proprietors hold their lands. It expressly interdicts and prohibits proprietors from levying as a tax from occupants of land\nmore than one-tenth of the produce. From this it appears that the Government of the day gave up to the proprietors, not the absolute right or ownership over the land, but only the Government right over it, that is, the tax of one-tenth of the produce. As far as I can trace from every enquiry, it appears that along the whole Eastern Coast of the Bay of Bengal from the commencement of the Burmese Territories to Point Romania, the right of the Sovereign is supposed to consist of one-tenth of the produce.* The ownership of the land is originally vested in the King, by whom it is made over to subordinate occupants to cultivate and render productive, on the term of yielding a tenth of the produce of every article.\u2020 The object of the late Government in assigning to the persons designated as proprietors the right of levying a tenth, probably was to make it the interest of certain individuals to introduce, encourage and extend the cultivation of the lands. In some deeds those terms are expressly mentioned. How far that object has been attained will best appear by the former report of Mr. Lewis. It appears by that report, that of 1,400 square miles, only acres 5,653 are in cultivation. It appears that so far from the persons called proprietors taking any pains to that purpose, they never even visit these estates, that they do not even themselves collect their tenth, but rent it in the mass once a year to a China contractor by public sale, who, having only one year's interest in the country, extracts from it the utmost he can, and it appears not only from the report of Mr. Lewis, but my own enquiries, that an excess is sometimes levied beyond the tenth, moreover that services are required, and labour exacted, from the tenants; in short they are kept in a state of vassalage and servitude quite inconsistent with the encouragement of cultivation. The right of levying the Government rent carries with it all the rent power of the State. That right vested in the Dutch proprietors, by them transferred in the mass to Chinese, has established a power and influence in that class too great even for the Officers of Government to hold in check. The advantages, therefore, that would result from the redemption of the rights of Government are too obvious to require further illustration. The present proprietors are stated to be willing to part with their privileges on certain terms and conditions. According to my idea,\n\n* I exclude that portion of the coast held by the Siamese Government. It is known that the Chief of Ligore takes in kind 40 per cent. of the produce, leaving to the cultivator bare subsistence.\n\n\u2020 Here then we find, as in many parts of India, two distinct rights:\u2014(1) The right to the Government tenth. (2) The right of occupancy vested in the subordinate tenant on their paying the tenth.\nthese should be settled on the principle of tendering them in the shape of an annual payment the full equivalent of which they now receive. That is to say, the proprietors should agree on their own behalf and that of their heirs to surrender and deliver up all rights, privileges and advantages, resulting from this present title, to Government, receiving in return a certain annual sum, payable as long as the British Government shall remain in possession of Malacca. It might have been expedient to have awaited the orders of the Hon'ble Court of Directors before such a measure was carried into execution, but it appears to me that the case admits of no delay. Unless immediate advantage be taken of the disposition evinced by the proprietors to part with their titles, the object may be entirely defeated, for it is impossible to say what complicated rights may arise, and come into judicial decision which may oppose difficulties to future arrangement. It is clear that, by agreeing to pay a sum equivalent to the present amount of their receipts, or even something more\u2014the right being rented and a certain excess of profit, without reckoning undue exaction, must remain to the contractor, and which would, of course, be levied by the Officers of Government\u2014no loss could occur. In support of such an arrangement, and to induce consent to such, it may be pointed out to the proprietors that, by their tenures, they are bound to perform certain services, which, though neglected by the late Government, will be required under our administration; that in all old Grants the right of Government to impose a land tax is expressly reserved, is indeed inherent in every Government, and must, in all probability, be reverted to at no distant period, as it is not to be supposed that Government can be at the expense of affording efficient protection to the country without some contribution of the people, levied in all other countries for purpose of Government. The titles to many of the principal estates as they are called, I have reason to believe are of a very questionable nature, and if strictly scrutinised would be found probably very defective: they have on some occasions been acquired, and their limits extended by the exercise of private and undue influence rather than the sanction of public authority. The circumstance of their having been long in possession of the right, such as they are, is the main argument to induce the offer of pecuniary compensation for their redemption. Should the proprietors, as they are called, decline coming to terms, a strict investigation must take place; the terms expressly stipulated on those quoted in Mr. Lewis's last report, that is, the right of resumption must be exerted whenever they can be traced. The offer of paying an annual sum to the proprietor involves no admission of their claims,\nfor it must be understood that only on their accepting these terms we waive all enquiry. It would appear that many of the original title deeds lodged in the Office of the Court have been made away with, I entertain little doubt, by persons interested, and that the right of resumption and the provision for cultivating and improving them was inserted in all. Should the proprietors assent to the transfer, our course will be very clear; we shall then stand in their place in relation to the actual tenantry. The possession of the lands now occupied and cultivated must, of course, be ensured to them, that is, on the payment of the regular tenth and no more, due notice must be given them that all existing rights will be carefully preserved to them, that regular papers will be given to them specifying and defining the land attached to each, and securing possession to them and their heirs on the established terms. They must be told that they are relieved from all vassalage and feudal services whatever, that their labour is free, that in rendering the tenth of the produce, all pecuniary obligations due to the State are fulfilled, and that for every article required over and above, payment will be made. It must, however, be understood that the settlement to be made with the occupants will embrace only the lands actually cleared, occupied and cultivated; to all lands actually waste and forest the right of Government is reserved; for the gradual clearing of all such lands, arrangement must from time to time be made by the Officers of Government, and in this respect the known and established principle will be observed. That is, to grant cutting papers to such as may apply, to allow to the parties the occupation of the land free of any payment for a given number of years, after which to be liable to the payment of the established tenth or such other terms as Government may settle with the parties. In a country where the soil is particularly rich and fertile, the climate peculiarly favourable and healthy, where due care and attention exist towards the protection of the persons and property of the inhabitants, influx of population and great extension of cultivation may be reasonably expected.\n\nHaving made these observations respecting the lands, and proposed a certain course to be eventually pursued, the next point for consideration is the Police of the country. From the report of Mr. Garling above alluded to (of the 11th December), I infer generally that there exists no Police in the interior, that the authority of Government has never been established, that the few inhabitants occupying lands near our frontier are subjected to constant annoyance from the Chiefs and inhabitants beyond them, that the proprietors can neither collect their tenth, or even prevail\non any one to reside there. It appears from Mr. Lewis's report that certain persons under the Chief of Moar have been allowed to establish themselves within the boundaries known from time immemorial as the boundary of Malacca up to Mount Ophir; that this encroachment has been brought about by the aid and connivance of a Dutch proprietor, who was content to act as sub-renter of that Chief, who brought persons into Court to depose to points affecting the limits of the territory; thus, by a strange inconsistency, the sovereign rights of Government, determinable by them only in the Political Department, were brought into discussion in a Municipal Court, which had no jurisdiction whatever in the case. The circumstance of a Dutch subject coming forward to infringe the limits of Dutch territory, affords proof of the singular power assumed by the individual, and the strange laxity and inattention of the Government to their own interest. It would appear indeed, from all I can learn, that the whole time Malacca remained under us, from 1795 to the end of 1818, the public authorities took but little interest in the affairs of the place. Holding it only for a time, the Dutch laws continued in force, and the Dutch Court of Justice was continued in operation, but instead of confining its powers to its proper duties\u2014the administration of Municipal Law\u2014the case before us shows that the Court in reality performed the functions of Government. I mention this subject now, in order to induce caution on the part of the public Officers in parting with the Records of the Dutch Court in Judicial Proceedings, since it seems evident they contain as much matter of Government as of Justice; the whole of the Records should, therefore, be kept as Government Records, the Officer of the Court of Judicature being allowed to inspect, examine and take copies when required.\n\nIn respect to the measure to be pursued in order to effect the removal of the persons from Moar, and the restoration of the integrity of our territory, I am of opinion a letter should be written to the Chief of Moar to recall them. If not attended to, the gunboat with a party of Sepoys and a careful person may be sent up to a proper position to insist on their removal, but I apprehend little fear of opposition to our wishes. In respect to Police generally, it may be observed that, so long as the present persons called proprietors continue to levy their tenth, they must perform the reciprocal obligation imposed by their tenure of maintaining the peace of the country. In not performing that duty, they have entirely failed in their obligation to the State. Were the Government, therefore, now to maintain Police Establishments, it would only be to incur an expense which the proprietors ought to pay, and they should be distinctly informed that so long as they exercise the pro-\nper functions of Government in the collection of the tenth, deriving the profit thereby, they must perform the reciprocal duty. Another duty properly belonging to the proprietors is that of repairing roads, bridges, paths, &c.; this duty appears to have been much neglected; by all account the roads are by no means in the state they used to be, and ought to be in; the little labour that has been bestowed, I suspect to have been the forced labour of the inhabitants, extracted from them by the proprietors, and not paid for. Should the proprietors agree to part with their titles on reasonable terms, the establishment of a regular Police will not be a difficult matter. The enquiries I have made confirm me in the belief that the Panghooloos are the fittest instruments of Police, they appear to be the principal inhabitants of these villages or divisions. Their proper duty has indeed been to levy the tenth on account of the proprietor. When the proprietor puts his right up to outcry and sells to a Chinese contractor this duty seems to be done by the contractor himself, much to the prejudice of the people; the Panghooloo continues, however, to enjoy the immunities of his office\u2014exemption from the payment of the tithe. Two of the Panghooloos I met with at Ayer Panas, distinctly informed me that their fathers were the Panghooloos before them, and that they expected their sons to succeed them. I infer that by the custom of the country the office is hereditary in families, and I think the admission of such practice generally beneficial, as more likely to ensure good conduct and being consonant to the idea of the people.\n\nTo render the Police efficient throughout the country, it would only be necessary to appoint the Panghooloo the Superintendent of the Police, to use the European term, Constable of his division, to allow him one or more Peons, to explain to him his duties, they are in this case very simple\u2014to seize, and send in all persons breaking the peace or committing crimes and offences, and to execute orders from the superior Magisterial authorities of the country; other duties naturally present themselves\u2014that of keeping a correct list of all the inhabitants of his division, their characters and mode of life, requiring all newcomers and passers by to report themselves, allowing no person to settle without a register, or report to and license from superior authority. In their Revenue capacity, that is, as a servant of the proprietors, eventually of Government, his duty will be to collect the tenth, to report the state of the crops and of the general cultivation. The duties, if I may use the expression, of Revenue and Police are so blended, that they can best be performed by the same person. As to the argument that may be used in respect to abuse of powers, we must recollect that all power in human hands is liable to abuse, that abuse would probably be\ngreater, certainly not less, by the employment of a separate stipendiary establishment of strangers\u2014Chuliahs or Chinese. Abuse of power can only be prevented by constant local supervision of the Public Servants of Government, and whether the rights of Government are redeemed or left with proprietors, the occasional presence and inspection of Public Officers is indispensable. The expense of erecting a few bungalows in different parts of the country would be very trifling, and I propose that no time be lost in their commencement. They should be built at different directions, at intervals of from six to ten miles,* and the roads between them made and kept in repair. To facilitate the means of communication is the first step to improvement and extension of cultivation. When ready means of access are afforded, when men find that they are alike secure at a distance from the town as they are on the spot, the lands then will be occupied and brought into cultivation, and it is only when that general protection shall have been fully established that we can expect Malacca to assume the appearance of a British Settlement. The communication between the Public Officers and the people should be at all times direct, free and unreserved. The interest of Government can never be separated from the prosperity, protection and happiness of the people. We can, therefore, have no object in deceit or concealment of our intention towards them, and from the knowledge possessed by Mr. Lewis of the language, habits and customs of the Malays in general, I am led to hope his endeavours will be successful in leading the inhabitants of the Malacca Territories fully to understand and duly to appreciate our views in regard to them.\n\nAPPENDIX III.\n\nCOURT OF JUDICATURE OF PRINCE OF WALES' ISLAND, SINGAPORE AND MALACCA.\n\nMalacca, the 7th day of March, 1829.\n\nBefore Sir John Thomas Claridge, Recorder, and Samuel Garling, Esquire, Resident Councillor.\n\n* At Naning, at or about Tualang Hill; at or about Pangkalan Naning; at Ayer Panas; at half-distance; at the Pepper Plantation; at Supan Hill; at Garling Hill; at Lingy.\nABDULLATIF v.

Benson Maxwell, C. J.\n\nMarch 17, 1870.\n\nSAHRIP v. MITCHELL AND ENDAIN.\n\nTrespass. Meaning of the expression \"hold by prescription\" used in sec. 12 of Indian Act 16 of 1839, with respect to lands in Malacca.\n\n* Extracted from the Civil Court Book for Malacca, Vol. 1.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is an action of trespass. The petition contains two counts\u2014one for expelling the plaintiff from his land and preventing him from reaping the growing crop; the second, for breaking and entering into his dwelling house and expelling him from it, whereby he was prevented from carrying on his business, and was compelled to procure another dwelling. The first three pleas deny the trespass and the possession. The fourth alleges that the plaintiff, not being a cultivator or resident tenant holding by prescription, was, by a duly served notice, informed that the land in question had been assessed by Government from the 1st of January, 1870, at 97 cents per annum, and was therein also called upon by the Collector to take out proper title for the land, within a month from the date of the service of the notice, and that in default he would be ejected. The plea then avers that the plaintiff would neither comply with the terms of the notice, nor remove from the land within a month; and that the defendants, by the order of the Collector, and in the exercise of the powers given to him by Act 16 of 1839, assisted him in ejecting the plaintiff, which are the trespasses, &c.\n\nThe Act referred to authorises the Collector, by section 3, to eject persons in occupation of land otherwise than under a grant or title from Government, if they refuse to \"engage for or to remove from\" it within a month from the date on which they are called upon by him to enter into such engagement or to remove. But the last section of the Act excepts from its provisions \"such cultivators and resident tenants of Malacca as hold their lands by prescription, subject only to a payment of one-tenth part of the produce thereof, whether such payment be made in kind\" or in money.\n\nThe trespass was clearly proved; indeed, it was in substance admitted. It was proved or admitted that a notice in the terms stated in the fourth plea, signed by the Lieut.-Governor, had been served on the petitioner a month before, and that by that officer's orders, the defendant Mitchell, a Clerk in the Land Office, accompanied by another Clerk of the same Office, went in company with the other defendant, Endain, who is a Police Duffadar, three other Policemen, and an European Inspector, to the house of the plaintiff at about 11 A.M. on the 24th December. The Policemen were armed with swords, and one of the Europeans with a double-barrelled gun. The plaintiff was absent; but they turned his wife and family out of the house, and the furniture was removed from it by their orders. The garden and paddy land were also taken possession of; they were afterwards sold by auction by Mitchell; and the plaintiff\nwas kept out of possession down to the present time. The plaintiff's wife made some imputations, in the course of her evidence, on the conduct of defendants and their comrades, in aggravation of the trespass, to the effect that her box had been broken open and some money taken from it, and that some of her furniture had been broken; and she also spoke of a threat to burn down the house if she did not leave it; but, as I stated yesterday at the close of the case, I did not think the imputations sufficiently borne out to be entitled to credit. They were denied by Mitchell; they were not corroborated, as they might have been, if true, by other testimony; and I had no evidence that any complaint had been made at the time, of the loss or destruction of the money or goods. A question arose in the course of the case, whether the Lieut.-Governor was a \"Collector\" within the meaning of the Act 16 of 1839, and another, whether the notice was in accordance with the 3rd section, as it did not require the plaintiff \"to engage for or remove from\" the land; but in the view which I take of the main question in the case, viz., whether the plaintiff is one of those \"cultivators or tenants holding by prescription,\" who are excepted from the provisions of the Act by the 12th section, it is not necessary that I should express any opinion on them.\n\nThe term \"prescription\" does not apply in English law, as Mr. Davidson justly observed, to land, but only to incorporeal hereditaments, such as rights of way, common or light; and if the term were construed in its strictly technical sense, it would find no application to cultivators of land. We had no statute of limitations in this country, relating to land, until 1859, and if \"prescription\" were to be understood as referring to a title to land acquired by long occupation, the section in question would find little or no application here, because the title acquired by the cultivators and tenants in Malacca does not depend on any statute or law of limitations. But there is another sense in which the term may have been used, viz., in the sense of \"custom,\" and in this sense it would make the section so widely and justly applicable to the circumstances of this Settlement that it appears to me beyond doubt that it is in this sense that the Legislature used it.\n\n\"Prescription,\" properly so called, is personal; it is the title acquired by long usage by a particular person and his ancestors, or the preceding owners of the estates in respect of which the right is so acquired. A \"custom\" is also established by long usage, but unlike prescription it is \"local\" not personal; when once established, it becomes the law of the place where it prevails, to the exclusion of the ordinary law; and those who have a right under it, have\nit, not because they and their ancestors or predecessors have long enjoyed it, as in the case of prescription, but simply because the custom of local law gives it to them, without any reference to the length of their enjoyment. In the case of prescription, long usage gives title to an individual; in the case of custom, long usage establishes the custom, and it is the custom, become law, which gives title to a class of persons in a locality, and gives it to them at once. The two things are essentially different, but there is a sufficient similarity or analogy between them\u2014usage being an element common to both\u2014to account for their being occasionally confounded; and I think it plain, from the history of the land tenure of Malacca, that it was in the sense of \"custom\" that the term \"prescription\" was used in the Act of 1839.\n\nIt is well known that by the old Malay law or custom of Malacca, while the Sovereign was the owner of the soil, every man had nevertheless the right to clear and occupy all forest and waste land, subject to the payment, to the Sovereign, of one-tenth of the produce of the land so taken. The trees which he planted, the houses which he built, and the remaining nine-tenths of the produce, were his property, which he could sell, or mortgage, or hand down to his children. If he abandoned the paddy land or fruit trees for three years, or his gambier or pepper plantations for a year, his rights ceased, and all reverted to the Sovereign. If, without deserting the land, he left it uncultivated longer than was usual or necessary, he was liable to ejectment. See Mr. Newbold's Work on the Straits of Malacca, vol. I, 160. It is clear that rights thus acquired are not prescriptive, in the technical sense of the term, but customary. They are acquired as soon as the land is occupied and reclaimed, and the title requires no lapse of time to perfect it.\n\nIt was contended by the Solicitor-General that such a custom was unreasonable and therefore invalid; but if such an objection could now be raised after its long recognition, as I shall presently show, I should not hesitate to hold that the custom was not only reasonable, but very well suited to any country like this, where the population is thin and the uncleared land is superabundant and of no value. It must be for the advantage of the State to attract settlers to lands which are worthless as forest and swamp, and thus to increase at once the population and the wealth of the country. A similar custom or law prevails in Sumatra. (Marsden's Sumatra, 224.) In Java, every Javanese has the right to occupy uncleared land, paying for it by giving the State his personal labour on road-making or similar public work, one day in five, or now, under the\nDutch, one day in seven; and though it might seem unreasonable in England that one person should acquire an indefensible title to occupy the land of another by felling his forest and ploughing the land, I think that, in the circumstances of these countries, it is neither unreasonable nor impolitic for the sovereign power to offer such terms to persons willing to reclaim and cultivate its waste lands. But it is too late to question its reasonableness, after a long and continuous recognition, amounting virtually to an offer of forest land to all who chose to clear it, on the terms of the custom.\n\nThe Portuguese, while they held Malacca, and, after them, the Dutch, left the Malay custom or *lex non scripta* in force. That it was in force when this Settlement was ceded to the Crown appears to be beyond dispute; and that the cession left the law unaltered is equally plain on general principles. (Campbell v. Hall, Cowp. 204, 209.) It was held in this Court by Sir John Claridge, in 1829, to be then in full force*; and although it was decided by Sir B. Malkin in 1834\u2020 in conformity with what had been held in India, that the law of England had been introduced into the Settlement by the Charter which created the Supreme Court, it seems to me clear that the law so introduced would no more supersede the custom in question, than it supersedes local customs in England. Further, the custom has always been recognised by the Government; down to the present time tenths are collected, both in kind and in money, from the holders of land acquired under the custom; and from 1838 to 1853, commutations of the tenths into money payments were frequently made by deeds between the East India Company and the tenants, in which it was recited that the Company \"possessed the right of taking for the use of the Government 'one-tenth of the produce of all lands in the Settlement of Malacca,' etc.\" The Malacca Land Act of 1831 plainly refers to and recognises the same customary tenure, when it \"declares\" that \"all cultivators and resident tenants of lands\" (the sovereign or quasi-manorial rights of which had been granted away by the Dutch Government) \"who hold their title by prescription, are, and shall be subject to the payment of one-tenth of the produce thereof to Government,\" either in kind or in money fixed in commutation.\n\nThat the 12th Section of the Act of 1839\u2021 would be justly ap-\n\n---\n\n* See the case of Abdullah v. Mahomed Meera Lebe, supra, p xxxvii.\n\u2020 See Judgment of S.r B. H. Malkin; In the goods of Abdullah deceased.\u2014Morton's Decisions, p. 19.\n\u2021 Section 12 of Act XVI of 1839 is as follows:\u2014\"And it is hereby provided that nothing in this Act contained shall apply to such cultivators and resident tenants of Malacca as hold their lands by prescription, subject only to a payment to Government of one-tenth part of the produce thereof, whether such payment be made in kind or in the form of a sum of money received by the Government in commutation of the payment in kind.\"\nplicable to these customary tenants, can admit of little doubt, when it is considered that that Act made all persons, in general terms, holding lands in these Settlements otherwise than under Government grants, liable to assessment \"in such manner, at such rate, \"and under such conditions\" as the Collector, under instructions from Government, chose to impose; and authorised the Collector to eject all those who declined to \"engage for\" (that is, I suppose, to accept the terms of the Government), \"or remove from the land\" in their occupation. These provisions, suitable enough to new Settlements like Singapore and Penang, where neither custom nor even prescription had had time to spring up, could not, without manifest injustice, have been applied to persons in Malacca, who had already a good title to their land by the law or custom of the place; it was to be expected that provision should be made for excepting such a numerous and important class of persons from their operation, and it seems to me that provision was made for that purpose by the 12th section, the Legislature using the word \"prescription,\" not in its technical meaning, in which it would be insensible, having regard to the circumstances of the Settlement, but in the sense of local custom, usage or law, with which it is readily confounded.\n\nIf this be so, it is plain that the plaintiff was not liable to ejectment by the Collector for declining \"to take out the proper \"title\" for the land in his occupation, under the Act of 1839. It was forest and uncultivated land when he cleared it in 1829, and he paid tenths to the Government from that time until 1853, when he was appointed Penghulu. This appointment he held until 1868, and during his tenure of it he was, as is usual, exempted from payment. He was deprived of the appointment in 1868, and he paid tenths again in 1869. He is, therefore, plainly one of the customary tenants protected by the 12th section of the Act of 1839.\n\nThe only remaining question, then, is as to the damages. The plaintiff claims three hundred dollars. It seems to me that a serious wrong was done him, and that he sustained serious injury when he was expelled from his home and from his land. He had lived there for forty years, and I shall not conceal that I have some sympathy for the feelings of the Malay peasant, driven from his cottage, from the orchard which he planted and the field which he reclaimed\u2014from his home, in a word, and from the fruits of his labour\u2014because he would not give up his good title for one which he was not bound to accept, and nobody had the right to impose on him. But further, the injury was done by or under the orders of an officer, or officers, invested with certain powers, and under the colour of those\npowers; and I think that, when public officers set about exercising powers which necessarily inflict suffering or injury, or interfere with the rights or liberties of any person, they ought to be extremely cautious in what they do, or make their agents or subordinates do. Here, the defendants, acting on their own or their superiors' view of the law (it matters not which, as regards the plaintiff), committed a breach of the law, and a breach which might have resulted in a breach of the peace; for among the seven men engaged in the trespass, several were armed, and if the plaintiff had happened to be present, they might have encountered resistance; blood might have been shed, and the officers of the law would have had to answer for all the consequences of having been trespassers and wrong-doers. On the other hand, most of our native peasants, in the plaintiff's place, whether they resisted or yielded, at the time, to the display of force in the name of the law, would not have ventured, as the plaintiff has, to question its legality in a Court of Justice, and they would thus be permanently dispossessed contrary to law. For these reasons, I think it my duty to do what in me lies to discourage such proceedings; and, therefore, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I shall give the plaintiff the amount of the damages which he has claimed.\n\nJudgment for the plaintiff for 300 dollars.\n\nAPPENDIX IV.\n\nPROCLAMATION.\n\nA complaint having been laid before the Court of Justice that the Captain Malayu, land-holder for Sungei Pootat and Bato Brandam, has demanded from his tenants more than $\\frac{1}{10}$ on the produce and also on sales or transfers of the property of cultivators,\n\nConsidering that it is against the rules and regulations of the place and opposed to the prosperity of the Settlement, we have found it advisable, in order to obviate this evil, to make known by proclamation that any one found guilty of exacting from any of his tenants a rent exceeding the tenth of the produce, will be\nfined 500 Rix dollars for such offence\u2014one-half of which will be given to the Churches and the other half to the Government.\n\n14th December, 1773.\n\nJOHN CRANS.\nG.

CASSA.\n\nPROCLAMATION.\n\nWe, John Samuel Timmerman Thyssen, Governor of Malacca and its Dependencies, to all to whom these Presents may come, send greeting:\n\nWhereas it has come to our knowledge that several covetous persons, proprietors of landed estates, have demanded from their tenants residing on their estates and possessing plantations, which through their industry have been brought to perfection, more than the fixed rate of ten per cent. on the produce of such plantations, and whereas it has also been represented to us that, on the transfer or sale of such plantations, the landed proprietors have demanded ten per cent. upon the amount realized for the same;\n\nAll of which, we consider to be an unwarrantable extortion, by which the prosperity of the Settlement and the interests of the industrious inhabitants, must in a great measure be affected;\n\nSo it is, that in order to obviate this evil, we direct the following to be promulgated:\n\n1st.\u2014That the proprietors of lands shall be satisfied to levy only a tenth upon the produce of their leased lands.\n\n2nd.\u2014That whenever money shall be paid by the tenants of their leased lands or plantations, instead of payment being made in kind, the landed proprietors must, in such cases, annually pass a contract in the presence of two witnesses, viz., the Penghooloo of the district, and the High Priest residing in the neighbourhood, who shall declare that none of the contracting parties have been compelled to enter into such an engagement.\nFurther, it shall be free to every tenant, after he has planted his ground with fruit trees, or cultivated it, to dispose of the same to another person, without paying to the land-holders the ten per cent.\n\nWe renew, against this extortion, the proclamation of the Governor and Director Jan Crans, bearing date 14th December, 1773, and enforce the penalty of 500 Rix dollars denounced in that publication against the transgressor of this order, the one half of which amount will go to the poor funds and the other to the informer.\n\nIt is understood by this, that in the event of a tenant wishing to dispose of his plantation, or transfer it to another, the land-holder shall have the preference on paying down the sum offered by another.\n\nAnd that no one may plead ignorance, this publication will be published in the Dutch, Portuguese, Malay and Chinese languages.\n\n20th May, 1819.\n\nAPPENDIX V.\n\nEVIDENCE OF TITLE.\n\nSPECIMENS OF DUTCH DOCUMENTS.\n\nI.\u2014\u201cPROPRIETOR\u2019S\u201d GRANT.\n\nGovert van Hoorn, Governor and Director of the Town and Fortress of Malacca, in the place of the late Inche Hollanda, Malay Translator and Writer of the East India Company, to whom the land of Battan Tiga, extending in length from Tanjong Broas to Cooleban Pekeneno* and in breadth on the north side extending to Bertam, was given for the good of this place, not only to cultivate it, but especially to settle it in order that no evil-minded or other disreputable people may have harbourage in the said land.

We promise at the request of Inche Aron to recommend to the favourable consideration of the succeeding Governor, our Successor, if his conduct should deserve the favour, to place his son Samsoodeen in the next possession of the said piece of land in the event of his death or resignation of the charge, this we do in consideration of the loss of 900 Rix dollars sustained by Inche Aron, arising from the mortgage of the said land to him by his predecessor Inche Hollandia. The above land is, however, subject to all Government impositions and taxes which are at present in force or may hereafter be introduced.\n\n(Signed) G. van Hoorn.\n\nMalacca, 17th June, 1700.\n\nII.\u2014GRANTS OF TOWN LOTS.\n\nJan Crans, Governor and Director of this place and of the Fortress of Malacca and its whole jurisdiction, makes known.\n\nThat I have allowed and granted with the consent of the board of Administration of this place, as I allow, grant and make over by these presents, to the master of the Smith's shop, Mr. Omstee a piece of unoccupied and uncultivated ground, belonging to the East India Company, bordering upon the trench, to the East of this Fortress, between the points Amelia and Henrietta Louisa, broad in front along the road, six rods and three feet, course N.

J. E. TENISON-WOODS, F.G.S., F.L.S., &c.\n\nLECTURE I.\n\n17th April, 1884.\n\nI have here before me two pieces of stone. One, you observe, is a rough fragment of granite of irregular shape; the other is a rounded pebble such as you may pick up any day from the gravel of a running stream. If I ask how these stones came to have their respective appearance, few would hesitate for an answer. You would say that one has been roughly broken off from a rocky mass; and the other has been rounded in the bottom of a running stream. Yet, in these opinions, simple as they are and evidently borne out by the facts of the case, you have formed by the interpretation of the geological record. You have acted upon a principle which, if followed up, must lead to the interpretation of many of the geological features upon the earth's surface. You have deciphered one of the inscriptions which nature has written on the stones, that is to say, the record of the way in which its forces have been exercised.\n\nIn this respect, there is a close resemblance between the work of an Archaeologist or Antiquary and that of a Geologist. For example, the antiquary finds a stone, covered all over with inscriptions. This, he says, must have been done by a human hand. The man who has cut this has known the use of metals as well as writing. His people had arts, and thus he draws conclusions which no one will be found to dispute, which no one can dispute, as they obviously belong to the facts of the case, however much we may question theories built upon these facts.\n\nPrecisely in a similar manner we are able to draw conclusions from the inscriptions on the stones before us. The first is rough\nand its fractured edges show that it has been detached from a more massive rock by the exercise of some force. But I shall reserve for another occasion what I have to say about this piece of stone.\n\nThe second stone is water-worn. Whatever shape it had formerly, that shape has been modified by the action of a running stream. No other natural action gives to stones the peculiar smooth and rounded shape that this stone has. It has not, however, been produced by water alone. There has been also the grinding action of friction by one stone upon another. Running streams have their gravel in constant motion. By carrying away sand and lighter particles, the large stones are constantly shifting their position and rolling over. Then a flood comes, and the stones are pushed along and pounded against one another until the edges of the fragments have abraded and rounded. This process of hammering, breaking and washing is one that is constantly going on. It is more rapid of course and constant in swift deep streams. Irregular as it would seem, modern science has found means to measure it. By the use of the water telescope and by actual experiment, Mons. Daubr\u00e9e has learned much that formerly was, in this matter, mere conjecture. By means of revolving cylinders, he found that when pieces of granite are subjected to the kind of movement and friction met with in rivers, they are reduced to fine mud when they have traversed a distance of about 25 miles.\n\nOne word here about this granitic mud, which will form subsequently a subject of our enquiry. Though the change from a rough piece of granite to mere fine mud is very great, yet it is not so complete as to elude detection by the microscope. With the aid of this instrument, an expert can tell you at once that such mud has been derived from granite. He can not only tell you what kind of granite it was, but also whether it contained any metals. He can also say with certainty whether it was the action of the sea or rivers which reduced it to mud, and many other particulars which we shall find hereafter most useful in our present enquiries.\n\nIt may seem very unnecessary to spend so much time in explaining so simple a thing as the manner in which stones become water-worn. But obvious as it is, I think you will acknowledge its importance if you will bear with me a little longer. Simple also as it is, several important geological conclusions depend upon it; and in fact, like most simple things in nature, when closely observed, it serves to explain what is very complex. Thus, if you pay attention to the hills and mountains which surround the beautiful valleys near Thaipeng, you will notice features which this water-worn piece of stone will help you to explain. Our mountain\nrange has been rounded and moulded in a manner similar to all mountain ranges of its class on the earth's surface. The crest of the range rises and falls according to the projections of the rocks which are mostly bare on the summit. Weathering soon decomposes and rounds them, and the materials are swept to lower levels. From the crest buttresses descend; the drainage from which soon carves out deep valleys on the sides. On these latteral buttresses other valleys are cut down, and so on almost infinitely. The whole thing, however complex, represents one huge system of drainage. The great surface presented by the side of the range acts as an extensive condenser to the moist air from the sea. The water is ever rushing down back to the ocean, first in rivulets, then in torrents, and often, as an obstinate face of rock stops the water dashing over, in angry cascades. It is never at rest. Each day the process of wearing away goes on in thousands of rills and streams. But observe that it is not water alone which is doing the work. The sand and fragments of rock carried down by the water does the great work of scouring and cutting down the valleys, and the mountains are thus very slowly but surely worn away.\n\nAt one time in their history, probably these mountains were upheaved, but upheaval has little to do with their present form. The features which so many mountains share in common, point to some common cause for all, and this is what we call weathering, erosion or denudation. It is the effect of the friction of water and sand just as we see in the case of the water-worn pebble. So when you hold that pebble in your hand, you hold in miniature what the water is doing in the hills around you. Water is the universal solvent, and the law of gravity does the rest. Rocks are undermined and come tumbling down in landslips which fill up the valleys. Water pounces upon them here again and gives the stones no rest. They are worn away and carried to the sea, and the valley is scooped out again waiting for other supplies of material. Thus, gradually, main ridges become scarped and cut down by side valleys until they dwindle away. The materials are carried into plains which gradually build up islands and mud flats such as those which front the western side of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThose who have visited the top of the range must have remarked how the crystals of felspar stand out from the surface of the granite just like pebbles in conglomerate. They often project an inch or more. Weathering has dissolved away the rock around them. Their crystalline structure and compact form enable them to resist decomposition, and thus they remain, for a time, as a\nrecord of what water has done.\n\nIf, then, the Thaipeng Range has thus assumed its present form by the action of water, we may assume that we have no means of knowing the extent to which it has been worn away. It certainly was higher than it is, and I shall show you what reason there is for believing that it was covered by other formations. But one thing we can certainly say. It has not been recently raised from the sea. Recent marine remains are entirely absent from it. I need not tell you perhaps that the sea never leaves doubtful signs of its presence where it has once been. Its infinite treasures of life leave millions of relics behind to mark the history of its stay. Nothing of the kind is seen here. Instead, we have layers of vegetable remains to mark what has been the former land surface and how it has supported only plant life.\n\nTo find out the geological history of these hills we must interrogate the only record that remains to us, that is, the material derived from the rocks, the drifts, sands and mud banks. This at first would not seem to be a very hopeful enquiry. But more evidence will be forthcoming from it than one would think. Daubr\u00e9e's experiments have shown that rocks are broken smaller and smaller by water until there comes a time when friction and abrasion have no longer any power. This is when they are reduced to fragments about one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter. Not only do they then cease to become broken, but the fragments do not readily become rounded or abraded at the edges. Such fragments are easily examined by microscopes of moderate power. By its aid the sand tells us its history. If it be from the sea, particles of lime and shell with other familiar remains soon tell its origin. If it were aerial or from a desert, every particle will be rounded, abraded and opaque. If from fresh water there will be carbonaceous matter and a peculiar sorting of the materials which I shall explain more fully.\n\nWith these facts as a guide, let us now examine the material which has come down to the plains from the mountains. Close to the hills we shall find boulders and heavy gravel. Their weight obviously prevents these materials from travelling far. Amongst the boulders some are angular, or just as they have rolled down from the hills, and some are rounded by water. Further out in the plain, we find alluvium and certain outliers of rocks which have as yet escaped denudation. These sometimes rise into detached hillocks, such as the Resident's Hill. Or they may scarcely rise above the surface at all, such as the red clays near the Thaipeng gaol. These clays are most important, and we shall consider them more\nattentively by and by. The rest of the plains are river drifts.\n\nWhen persons see only narrow streams crossing wide plains, they with difficulty understand how such rivulets could have formed such large areas of gravel, sand and earth. But the cause is quite adequate for the effects, if we remember the constant drainage from the sides of the mountains. It is unceasingly bringing down new material, which, as it accumulates, throws the stream backwards and forwards. No matter how distant certain portions of the plain may be, as soon as they become the lowest level, the water goes over to it and heaps it up.\n\nIt was the custom, long ago, to explain deposits of alluvium and gravel by theories of great inundations. But great inundations and convulsions of nature have a tendency to destroy and remove. The building up is done by the little stream which, like the busy bee, neatly spreads the materials. They may be called nature's chisels which carve and chip the stone, and nature's trowels which smooth and level everything.\n\nBear in mind again that the whole of the plains are not formed of alluvium. There were inequalities on the surface which are covered over by drift, but of unequal thickness. These, no doubt, were barriers to the waters until the drift rose up to them.\n\nBut not only does drainage level the materials. It sorts them as it carries them along. Lighter portions of granite sand, especially mica, are carried a long distance. Some metals also with light scaly ores, such as specular iron or titaniferous iron, are borne a long way. Heavy metals such as tin, gold and platinum, soon sink and remain behind.\n\nIn another lecture, I shall tell you more about granite, or the rough piece of stone with which we began this evening. But I want to say now that granite frequently contains metalliferous veins and crystals of oxide of tin scattered through it. This latter is a heavy mineral, and is never carried far from the hills. It is enclosed in granite, or at least mixed up with other rock, yet it is gradually sorted out and gathered together. The constant operations of water washes it and buries it in alluvial drift where it becomes stream tin. Vein tin, from its name, means tin ore occurring in lodes or veins, whence it has to be quarried from the solid rock. Vein tin, though in narrow lodes, goes down to great depths; stream tin is only a shallow deposit of fine ore spread over a wide surface. It is better ore and more accessible, but less permanent than vein tin.\n\nBut has all the alluvial drift of the L\u00e2rut plains been derived from granite? I think not. I referred just now to the red clays.\nThese are stratified. If you examine those which are not far from the gaol, you will perceive in them a singular ribbon-like structure. There are lines varying between red, yellow, white and dark slaty blue. In some places, traces of quartz veins may be seen. The strata are twisted and crumpled into curves and folds. Now, I regard this as a very ancient formation, and which once probably covered the granite. The latter rock has been pushed through it, and this is why we find it principally at the base and the sides of the range. Probably the granite itself has been formed from this rock. It has been melted into its present crystalline form. But the clays contain more iron than the granite does. They have been much changed by their contact with the granite, and some portions of the formation have been converted into what geologists call \"gneiss.\" I fear I cannot explain these terms to you now in the time at my disposal.\n\nThere is one thing about these clays which must strike observers, and that is their fiery red colour. This is due to per-oxide of iron or rust of iron. In these countries such a rock is called \"laterite.\" Though the term is applied to many different kinds of rock, in fact any red stone or clay, I am now referring to only one kind, which is that derived from the paleozoic or ancient formation which lies above the granite. I wish to add also that, when not affected by much oxidation or rusting, these clays are blue instead of red.\n\nThese paleozoic clays give us a clue to the age of the tin. It tells us that the metal occurs here as it does in other parts of the world, that is, in connexion with the oldest granites. These paleozoic clays are probably Ordovecian, or amongst the oldest of the stratified series known to geologists. Usually such clays or slates have been much altered by the changes to which they have been subjected in their long history.\n\nFrom the great extent in which these clays appear throughout the Malayan Peninsula we may conclude they they once covered the whole of it before the granite burst through. But before this took place, the strata were much twisted and altered owing to heat, pressure and movements of the earth's crust.\n\nThere are excellent sections of this formation in the cliffs around New Harbour, Singapore, and again where the new road cuts through the hills on which Fort Palmer is built. The east side of Fort Canning also at Singapore shows an outcrop of the same rock with regular strata dipping to the westward and a surprising variety of colouring. At Tanjong Kling near Malacca the fiery red rocks, more properly termed Limonite instead of Laterite.\nhave been derived from similar rocks. I call them Ordovecian, a term proposed for the Upper Cambian series, but I merely suggest this age as probable. They much resemble the Ordovecian of Australia, though the precise age cannot as yet be proved.\n\nIt is probably under these clays, at their junction with the granite, the great deposits of tin ore took place. All mining geologists are aware, that when any metal is contained in a rock, it will be most abundant at the junction of that rock with another formation. I do not undertake to explain why it is so, but I merely state the fact. The junction of two formations is the locality where metallic deposits must be looked for. The whole of the granite in the peninsula contains tin, but it is at the junction of this granite with the paleozoic clays that the richest deposits of tin ore have taken place.\n\nThus the red clays become a good indication where tin sand may be looked for. But observe: it is not at this junction that mining takes place. It is when the clay has been washed away and the tin washed out of the junction; when it has been sifted and sorted by streams of water that the stream tin has been deposited where miners get it now. Not at the base of the clays, but in the drift which has been derived from the clays and the granite together.\n\nIt may be asked, therefore, whether it would be worth while to mine through the clays where they have not been denuded and look for tin at their junction with the granite. I think it would be worth trying. I do not think the tin sand would be likely to prove so rich as in drift where it has been subjected to ages of washing and puddling from the streams. Tin sand is found upon the clays throughout Thaipeng and the neighbouring hills. I cannot even give a guess at how thick these clays are, except that I do not think they can be very thick. I repeat that it would be worth while trying whether there is what miners term a second bottom.\n\nObserve also that I do not think that the tin deposits are merely confined to the junction of the granite with the paleozoic clays. The ore may be found at the junction of the granite with any rock. On the other side of the range, we seldom see these clays, but in place of them we have limestone and marble abutting on the granite. Here also tin is found and in great richness.\n\nSo, those who go prospecting may take the presence of such formations as a favourable indication, especially where there are high ranges near so as to secure the destruction and thorough washing of the overlying rock.\n\nIf any one asks why we do not find tin in such places as Singa-\npore, where the paleozoic clays and granite are found side by side, the answer is that there are no drifts. The reason of that is that there are no high mountains near to give rise to them. Small quantities of tin have been found at the junction of the clays and granite at Singapore, sufficient perhaps to justify the conclusion that had they been subjected to the action of running water and mountain streams for ages, large deposits of stream tin would have resulted.\n\nAt the same time, I do not suppose that all the granite at its junction with some overlying formation is equally rich. Generally it is rich. There are doubtless barren granites here as elsewhere, but they seem to be fewer here than elsewhere.\n\nIt is a remarkable fact in mining for tin that stream tin ore and mineral veins or lodes of tin are seldom found together. I say seldom, because I am not so sure about the experience of Europe, but I might say never, as far as experience teaches us in Australia and in this country. The richest tin lodes in Australia (Herberton) have no stream deposits anywhere near them. I should say that the causes which made the tin segregate into lodes were more energetic than those which condensed it loosely on the edges of an overlying formation. This, however, is theory. What my experience teaches me as certain is,\u2014first, that stream tin is not derived from lodes or veins; and secondly, that lodes or veins do not decompose into anything like stream tin.\n\nNow let us, in conclusion, examine the sections presented by the tin mines at Thaipeng, and see how far these will bear out those inferences. First of all, we meet with loamy clay or black vegetable mould, full of roots, branches, stumps of large trees in the positions in which they grew, besides prostrate stems of trees. Half of this black deposit is water, and half the remainder is vegetable matter that will burn. Underneath are layers of white, red and yellow sands, mixed with coarse layers of quartz and felspar. There are also occasional deposits of red clay.\n\nBy the aid of the microscope we find that the sand is derived from granite and deposited in fresh water. If you examine it closely, you will see that the grains are all angular and transparent. When the polariscope is applied to them, we find a magnificent play of colours. By the same instrument we are enabled to distinguish a few fragments of felspar and fewer still of mica. A little experience enables one to pronounce at once that this sand has come from granite. If it had been derived from a volcanic rock, the quartz would be glassy and not give the play of colours that we observe here.\nThe red clays, and probably the yellow clays, are derived from the paleozoic strata. The white clays may be decomposed felspar from which the sand is washed out. All this careful sorting and sifting has been effected by the force of gravity aided by the never failing streams of water from the hills.\n\nOccasionally, vegetable soil is again repeated, showing that there were different surfaces of dry land at different levels and at various times in the geological history of these deposits.\n\nThen appear more or less worn fragments of quartz, felspar, fluourspar, and granite. This may be called a gravel, but its material is sometimes a stratum of mere pebbles, or sometimes consisting of large boulders. These represent various vicissitudes in the history of the stream. When such water-worn stones are cemented together, the rock is called a conglomerate.\n\nUnderneath all these deposits, at a depth of 20 or 30 feet, we find the stream tin. It is usually in a gravel with much fine clay and coarse sand, which gives the stratum a grey speckled appearance. The depth of the tin stratum is variable, but seldom more than four feet, and often, in even rich mines, much less. The tin rests upon white or blue clay either paleozoic or derived from the granite.\n\nNow, when we find the tin sand all in one place and in the lowest stratum, we must conclude that it came there by the force of gravity, or that the upper part of the rocks from which the tin was derived was richer in tin than that which subsequently supplied the materials for the drift. Both these conclusions, I think, are partly true.\n\nThe drift overlying the tin may, in some case, have been removed and replaced many times by the running waters as they shifted their beds. Streams undermine their banks, they fall in, and are thus turned over, washed and re-washed and the heavier particles of tin soon become a stationary stratum in the lowest part. This is the history of a good deal of the tin deposits, but not of all. According to what has been already said, some portions of the materials for the drift were richer in tin than others, that is, the junction of the paleozoic clays with the granite rock. When these rocks were subjected to erosion, tin sand accumulated in much larger quantities.\n\nIf this explanation be correct, then we ought to find tin sand at different levels in different mines, and, as a matter of fact, we do. But in one group of mines there is generally a correspondence in the level of the tin in all parts of the field. Thus in Thaipeng it occupies nearly the lowest levels, from which we may infer that a\ngood deal of barren rock has been denuded since the rich beds at the junction of the granite and clay have been washed away.\n\nTo some extent, tin sand may have gravitated through the loose watery sands even after they were deposited in beds. This actually occurs in thin strata of washed sand which is thrown out of the sluices. What little tin ore remains in this sand is found to have settled down to the bottom. But, of course, this could not happen through coarse gravel or compact clay.\n\nAt the risk of being tedious, I must repeat the important lesson to be learned from these facts. The way in which tin sand is found in rich deposits in certain parts only of the drift, shows that it has been the wearing away of some restricted portion of the rocks. This is at the junction of a formation overlying the granite. Wherever, therefore, either from the out-crop of the rocks or the nature of the drift such a junction appears evident, deposits of tin may be looked for. Red clays are to be regarded as a specially favourable indication, and so are out-crops of slate, schist or limestone near granite. But an essential condition appears to be that there should be high granite hills near, in order to secure the requisite drainage for the formation of drift.\n\nI have mentioned how hollows in the ground affect the deposition of tin. There are a good many depressions of the kind about these mines, though the surface is even. The ground, as the miners say, rises up, and the ore is almost absent from the slopes, while it is unusually rich in the hollows, those nearest the hills being the richest.\n\nIt may be asked whether tin sand might be looked for at any great distance from the hills. To this a double answer may be given. The first is that tin sand usually does not travel far, even when it is very fine. A mile from its origin would be a long distance.\n\nBut, secondly, tin may be looked for far out in the plains, because it is certain that both paleozoic clays or granite in the form of outlying hillocks have existed there, though now they are washed away. In this case, the nature of the soil would be the best indication.\n\nThe manner in which the paleozoic clays are stratified, and how the strata are turned and twisted and crossed by white veins, has suggested to the author of \"Tin Mines in L\u00e2rut\" that there were fearful convulsions of nature going on when the stream tin was deposited. But the cause of this dates much farther back. It dates to the period when the paleozoic were affected by the granite, and crumpled or folded back by that rock.\nI have gone through most of the points connected with the geology of stream tin, especially as it refers to the State of Perak. You will doubtless be inclined to ask a question which I have not touched upon at all. This is, how the occurrence of tin ore in such quantities in clays or in granite is accounted for. This must form the subject of another lecture, for the story is a long one. It cannot be accounted for in as satisfactory a manner as the occurrence of tin in drift, but the matter is of the highest interest, as you will find, connected with the most attractive field of geological research.\n\nLet me say, in conclusion, that the connexion of stream tin with paleozoic rocks, limestone and granite is a most cheering part for the future mining prospect of this State. Such rocks are to be found everywhere: the valleys of the rivers are full of them. This makes me think that the tin deposits of the Malay Peninsula are the richest in the world, and that we are as yet only on the threshold of our discoveries.\nLECTURE II.\n\n21st April, 1884.\n\nOur enquiry in this lecture will be as to the way in which we can account for the rich deposits of tin ore in connexion with granite rocks.\n\nYou will remember how, in the first lecture, we began with the study of two pieces of stone, one of which was water-worn and the other a rough fragment of granite. The water-worn stone furnished us with a clue to the erosions of mountains and the formation of drift. We shall now turn to the rough stone to sift the question of its constituent parts, and we will begin our enquiry by asking\u2014What is granite?\n\nBroadly defined, it is a compound rock consisting of quartz, felspar and mica. Quartz is a very hard glassy mineral consisting of the oxide of the element silicon. Felspar is a trifle less hard and more complex. It consists of, say roughly, 60 or 70 per cent. of quartz, a large percentage of alumina, and the rest made up of soda or potash, and a very little iron, lime and magnesia. Mica is a shiny glistening mineral, generally coloured yellow, blackish or transparent. It splits into thin flakes, and looks golden or silvery in small specks. Mica is a compound mineral and contains, besides other minerals, notably lithia, silica, alumina and an alkali usually potash and magnesia, the silica being in smaller proportion than in felspar.\n\nNow, observe that I am dealing with these things in the most general sort of way. There are not only many different kinds of granite but many different kinds of felspar. Granite also contains other different minerals besides those which I have mentioned, but exceptionally and in relatively small quantities. For my present purpose, however, my definitions as above are sufficient.\n\nObserve other differences in this stone. It is not stratified. There are no lines nor marks such as it would have if it were a rock slowly deposited by water. It is a mass of crystals. Now, how did it get this form and how comes it that such a uniform appearance is presented by granites all over the world? It is no matter where you are\u2014in Aberdeen, in Egypt, in Malacca, or Perak\u2014granite is granite everywhere, and every one who has eyes can recognize it.\n\nVarious theories have been proposed to account for this. I cannot describe them all, but I will take the most natural and the most common idea. That is, that the stone has been melted by fire. The earth's surface, so it is said, is pretty uniform in materials, and\nwhen it is melted and cooled, or slowly cooled if you will, becomes granite.\n\nBut against this theory we know many instances of the melting of the earth's surface by heat, and when cooled it becomes something very different from granite. Volcanoes emit from their craters the melted materials of the crust of the earth, but lava is not at all like granite, and even where it has cooled slowly it is still very different.\n\nHeat alone, then, will not suffice as a theory. A simple reflection will make us realize this better. Granite is in structure not unlike a piece of loaf sugar. But in the case of the sugar the structure is not due to mere heat, as I need not tell you. If you take the sugar and melt it over a fire, what a different material it becomes, and so it is with granite. If it be melted, which it requires an enormous heat to effect, the result, when cooled, is a mere slag.\n\nBesides, if granite be closely examined, a curious feature in the crystals will be noticed. The mica and the felspar have both left the forms of their crystals imbedded on the quartz. But the quartz cools at a much higher temperature than the mica or felspar. If heat alone had been in operation, the quartz should have cooled first and left its crystals to modify the other two minerals.\n\nBut for all that, geological research proved beyond a doubt that, melted or softened in some sort of way, granite had formerly been. At its junction with stratified rocks it was frequently found to throw out veins into fissures, and to be injected, so to speak, as a molten material could only be expected to do. Granite dykes or elvans are not uncommon, and these sometimes in granite itself showing that the encasing material of which the walls of the dyke are formed had cooled or solidified to some extent before the latter was injected. When granite is found in contact with stratified rocks, the latter are usually much changed, and as if the crystalline rock had affected them by its heat. When this is not the case, it can generally be proved that there has been considerable displacement and upheaval since the granite was melted. The tilted stratified rocks which lie against it came to their present position in a later period in the geological history of both formations. Sometimes gradual transition from stratified rock to granite may be observed, so that it is difficult to say where one begins and the other ends, and even where the unaltered slates which lie near granite are submitted to microscopic examination. Occasionally in granite itself marks of former stratification can be made out. Blocks of evidently stratified rock are found imbedded\nin granite paste. But the most extraordinary thing of all is that fossils have been found in granite, much changed, of course, and crystalline, but perfectly recognizable. The Jura Belemnites in the Alps may be cited as an example, and I think I have met with paleozoic fossils in a granitic rock in Australia.\n\nAll this was very puzzling and gave rise to many theories. The facts seemed to hold the balance equally between a stratified rock on the one hand, and a kind of volcanic, or at any rate, an eruptive rock on the other. Then the theory of metamorphism began to make its way. This suggested the granite had originally been a stratified rock, and that it had been converted into its present form by the agency of heat.\n\nThis, you observe, only removed the difficulty one step further back. The question was still unsolved as to what kind of heat it was. Gradually the microscope was brought to bear upon the matter, and this, with chemical aids, brought what is now believed to be a full and satisfactory explanation.\n\nIf you subject a small rough fragment of granite to microscopic examination, you will not learn much. But if you grind down thin polished slices until they become quite transparent, you will be able to subject them to very high magnifying powers. Then you will see that the apparently solid crystals are full of minute cavities. Some of these are partly filled with water, others with gas, others again are cavities containing perfect crystals of such minerals as common salt, and other salts of magnesia, soda, &c. These crystals sometimes appear in fluid, which may be water, and they are in constant movement.\n\nIt would be an error, however, to suppose that these appearances are only found in granite crystals. They are seen, though not exactly in the same manner, in volcanic rocks, in meteoric stones and even in the slags of furnaces. But microscopic examination has shown immense differences between granites and those which have been certainly subjected to heat within reach of the earth's atmosphere.\n\nI cannot, in the limits of such a lecture as this, go into the details of this subject, but it will be sufficient to say that the progress of science, largely aided by the microscopic investigation of rocks, has shown us a most probable and sufficient cause for the metamorphism of granites. All the different effects of heat are found to vary according to the pressure at which they have been exercised.\n\nIt will save a great deal of explanation if I enter at once into the consideration of what must have been the geological his-\ntory of the granites. First of all they are generally very old rocks. I say generally, because though most granites are paleozoic, there are mesozoic or secondary and cainozoic or tertiary granites as well. But the rock we have to deal with here is paleozoic, and I will consider that as affording the simplest case for consideration.\n\nNow, we have evidence in this country that the granite here has been covered by two more formations at least. These were of considerable thickness. Fifteen hundred feet of limestone is exposed in places, and even then it has been greatly denuded or worn away. The paleozoic clays belong to a formation which is known everywhere on the earth's surface to be very thick. The history of the geological changes in the earth's crust justifies the inference that between these two formations and the comparatively recent date of their uncovering and denudation, many other formations must have succeeded and disappeared. So that, without any stretch of imagination, you can perceive that our granite was at one time covered by an enormous weight of overlying rocks. The pressure thus effected I do not attempt to estimate. It defies calculation. Millions of tons weight would result from a hundred feet or so of rock, so what of thousands of feet!\n\nNow, pressure engenders heat. If we cannot estimate the weight, we may say, that at the most moderate computation, the heat engendered by pressure would have been sufficient to liquify the rocks. But the pressure would prevent liquefaction. The nature of the overlying rocks would also prevent much of the heat being lost by radiation.\n\nLet us turn for a moment, before we consider the effects of this heat, to take into account the material with which it has to deal. Before these granites were covered over, they were stratified. We can see this in many places where the marks of stratification have not been obliterated. There was a time, then, when these strata were laid down line by line horizontally by the river or the sea or the aerial current from which they were deposited. They then consisted of sand, which means silica, of mud or clay, which means alumina, magnesia, lime, soda, potash and a little oxide of iron. Fluorine and carbons, tin, gold or silver were also present infinitesimally. How they came to be present, I shall explain hereafter.\n\nBut there was one very important ingredient which we must not leave out, and that was water. All rocks contain this in a certain proportion. I do not mean those stores which come out as springs upon the surface, but water mingled with the ingredients of the rocks, that is, chemically combined. Gases of course there were,\nalso chemically combined, and also water in its simple form, mixed or soaked in we may say, and from which no compound rock is ever free.\n\nNow, consider the effect of heat caused by pressure on these materials aided by the presence of water. The latter material, you know, at the surface of the earth cannot be heated much above 212\u00b0 degrees of Fahrenheit. Then it evaporates in the form of steam. But under great pressure, of course it cannot evaporate. It may be then heated to any extent that the pressure will bear. Water, even cold water, is a solvent of rocks to a far greater extent than you would imagine, not only by wearing them away, but by really dissolving the stone. But at very high temperatures water acts on rocks such as quartz more powerfully than the strongest acid does upon iron at the earth's surface. Let us take dull red heat, for instance, and I will tell you presently why I choose that degree of heat. At this temperature, quartz would be readily dissolved by superheated water, while I need not tell you that it requires a considerably higher temperature to melt it in the air.\n\nThese conclusions are not the result of mere theory. Experiments have proved them. By means of carefully secured vessels, water has been raised to a red heat and even higher, and its action upon quartz, glass and many other substances observed. If I do not mistake, after an experiment which lasted some 18 months, some of the minerals of granite and something very like granite have been reproduced by Mons. Daubr\u00e9e.\n\nThis pressure, or the weight of the superincumbent rock, is quite sufficient to account for the change of stratified rock into granite. Pressure has generated heat, heat has brought into action the highly corrosive and solvent action of water, chemical action has been set up, those elements that have the greatest affinity for each other have united, acids have neutralised alkalies, gases have been liberated and made new combinations, and finally minerals have segregated, and the result is the rocks in the form in which we see them now.\n\nBe it remembered that though we class the rocks of this Range under one category, which we distinguish as granite, the rock is very varied in its constitution. It is fine grained, and coarse, blue and red, dark coloured and light. Some of it is almost all quartz and some foliated like a schist. Mica predominates in one place, and there are thick veins of felspar in another. All this is just what we should expect. The stratified rock was not of uniform character, but even if it were, the pressure would prevent the reduction of the whole into a rock of simple mineralogi-\ncal features. This fact must also explain the presence of metals in one portion and not in another.\n\nSome persons might find it difficult to understand how any interchange would go on under such pressure, but it will solve the difficulty to some extent when they are reminded that interchange and chemical action goes on in the hardest and most solid rocks. Solidity is a relative term. There is nothing on the earth so hard that a movement is not going on in its particles. The moving crystals in the cavities of granite prove this. Some think that light is the stimulus in this case. It may be so. That shows how even on the hard transparent diamond movement is continually going on, movement that is not more appreciable than the waves of light, yet movement and interchange for all that.\n\nI mentioned red heat just now, and I did so because certain geologists believe that this is the temperature to which granite has been raised. This is not a guess. It is founded on the known qualities of gases and steam. Their rate of expansion under heat and pressure is calculated in connexion with the cavities in granite. Some of these, it will be remembered, are half full of water, which has been steam. The amount of condensation furnishes a factor from which the former heat is estimated.\n\nAnother kind of proof as to the origin of granite is found in the sections of extinct volcanoes. A few instances are found which enable us to see down into the innermost recesses of these subterranean fiery lagoons. In the lowest depths where pressure of the overlying lava prevented the escape of steam, the rock is granite. In fact, the volcano itself is probably no more than the escape through an accidental fissure of some of that heat which pressure is causing below.\n\nWe must not, however, leave out of consideration one important condition in these operations, and that is the length of time through which they have been exercised. We have no standard by which to measure it. The period of history occupies only a few thousand years. Supposing the granite to have been seething and baking amid steam at a red heat for that time, we can well imagine surprising results. But probably nature's laboratory has been working for cycles in which the historical period is only a unit. What are the mutations observed in these granite hills as a work for such eternal ages? The silence and obscurity in their history is one of those mysterious chasms to the edge of which science has enabled us to climb, but where we can discern only a depth which is unfathomable.\n\nBut now to account for the presence of the tin in the granite,\nor rather in the strata from which the granite is formed. I am of opinion that it has been very finely, nay almost infinitesimally, divided through the rocks just as gold and silver is in the sea at the present day. Many people are not aware that these metals exist in solution in sea-water, but in so small a quantity, that tons of water must be evaporated before any appreciable quantity can be extracted. Now, it is quite certain that the precious metal is being deposited in the rocks forming on the sea-shore or at the sea-bottom at the present day. No doubt, immense quantities of this deposit would have to be reduced before even a trace of gold would be seen, yet the quantity is absolutely if not relatively great.\n\nBut what is not possible to man's chemistry is easily effected in the great laboratory of nature. If the present shore and sea deposits were subjected to such an action as that which reduced the ranges here to granite, we should have the gold in rich veins and shoots just as it is in the quartz veins in Australia. You may be inclined to say that the gold in Australia has been much more abundant than in the case I am supposing, but this is not so. It is estimated that more than five tons of quartz or vein-stuff has been operated upon for every ounce of gold extracted, which is considerably below the truth. This, however, be it less or more, is only a mere fraction of the rock metamorphosed from which this gold has been derived.\n\nThe whole process depends upon a peculiarity in the chemistry of minerals which is only imperfectly understood. This is a tendency to what we call segregation. Similar minerals seek each other out and run together. In the heavier metals when they are melted, one can understand it, but this occurs when the rocks or metals are not melted at all, where they are not particularly heavy, and where they take directions quite independent of the force of gravity. You will find veins of quartz and veins of felspar running through stratified rocks, you find lines of flints in chalk and septarian nodules in clay. If these things take place in solid rocks, every facility occurs for their occurrence in granite. Thus, in effect, we find in granite innumerable veins of quartz, felspar, iron ores, tin from seams of considerable thickness to the merest threads. They evidently do not depend upon cracks in the stone and could not have been injected in a fluid state. They have simply segregated and come together in that strange movement of particles to which the materials of the most solid rock are subject, by means of which they evidently travel long distance.\n\nNow, turning to the tin ore, we find it in the form of an oxide. Pay attention to this. Tin is easily melted. If it had been sub-\njected to mere heat, it would have run together in the form of pure metal as it does in the smelting furnace. But under heat pressure and with water, it is forced to combine with oxygen gas, a combination which is not easily effected without those conditions. Tin when kept at a red heat with free access of air; oxidizes readily. There are two forms of oxide of tin, one in which one volume of tin combines with one volume of oxygen, this is called the protoxide or stannous oxide obtained by chemical precipitation. It is a very unstable compound, and on slight application of red heat makes it burn like tinder and become stannic oxide. There is the second combination, or peroxide of tin, in which one volume of tin is combined with two of oxygen. This is the common ore of tin.\n\nIf heat alone had been concerned in the production of the tin which is found, it would have occurred in a different way. The peculiar oxide of tin, which is so familiar to you here, is a state of the mineral which can hardly be adequately explained, unless formed slowly. Crystals of Cassiterite may have been formed by the sole action of water just as crystals of silica are so formed. But the proximity of the granite renders the conclusion more probable that the agencies of heat, pressure and superheated steam have been all in operation in the production of this oxide of tin.\n\nUsually, the form of the fragments of Cassiterite in the drifts is not crystalline. You do find many crystals, but the majority of the grains are angular and amorphous. The edges are very clean and sharp, and not often manifesting any marks of abrasion. They resemble in this respect the fragments of quartz washed out of granite which are associated with them in the drift. From this I conclude that the tin has been amalgamated in the matrix or other rock paste just as quartz, felspar and mica are.\n\nI am rather diffident in propounding a theory as to how this may have occurred. Supposing, however, tin to have been finely disseminated through the formation which went to form the granite, it may have been sublimed and then condensed on the edges of the strata where the metamorphism was not complete. Thus it is found at the junction of the granite with the stratified rock. The use of the terms subliming and condensation may be a little misleading. I only use them as generally expressing the category to which the processes may have belonged. As a matter of course, they must have been different, because the conditions were different from anything which we can reduce to experiment.\n\nI am aware how unsatisfactory any theory is which cannot be brought to some test for its verification. In this matter, however, we must rest content with explanations which are little more than\nplausible guesses. In tracing back things like the metalliferous deposits to their true causes, we are still working very much in the dark. My object in this lecture has been to point out what is really known about metamorphism and to show how it bears upon the occurrence of such ores as Cassiterite. I hope I have at least succeeded so far as to give you a clear and simple exposition of the subject, and with this, I must rest satisfied and conclude my lecture.*\n\n*Note.\u2014Tin is found in drifts or alluvial deposits in Perak. Many think that it must have been derived from veins and that these will yet be found. The context of these lectures will show that I do not think so. The true matrix of the tin is in granite at its junction with the clays where it has been abundantly disseminated in fine and coarse grains. Nevertheless, in northern Perak there are tin veins or true lodes. Furthermore, I wish to place on record my opinion that the stream tin deposits of Perak are practically inexhaustible.\nR\u0113mbau.\n\nAs little has been recorded on the subject of this State, except in works not very accessible, and as I have visited it officially on several occasions, I have thought that a short account of the country may not be without some interest for the readers of this Journal.\n\nThis State is one of the countries known as the \"Negri Sembilan,\" or Nine States, formerly under a Yam T\u00fban (in full, Yang-di-pertuan) B\u0115sar and a Yam T\u00fban M\u00fbda, each, however, with its own chief or Dato' P\u0115ngh\u00fblu.\n\nIn R\u0113mbau, as in N\u0101ning and others of the \"Nine States,\" a considerable portion of the population are M\u0115nangk\u00e2bau by descent, and M\u0115nangk\u00e2bau people still come over, as they do to Malacca.\n\nIts name is said to derive from an enormous M\u0115rbau tree which used to grow in the plain near the foot of G\u00fbnong Dato'; there are said to be some traces left of it still.\n\nAnother account states that the great tree fell down from the mountain, and that the name of the country arose from the description of the noise of the fall as the colossal stem thundered down the steeps\u2014\"m\u0115rbau r\u0115mbau.\"(1)\n\nIt is further related that so vast was the size of this giant of the jungle that its head reached to the Sungei \u016ajong(2) stream, to which it gave its name (i.e., Sungei \u016ajong K\u00e2yu M\u0115rbau); while its branches extended to the Moar, and it has been pretended that from\n\n---\n\n(1) Probably a case of metathesis. This is likely enough to be the origin of the name; the other accounts are, of course, later embellishments.\n\n(2) This is the recognised official spelling, or I should spell it \"H\u016bjong\" in accordance with the proper Malay spelling, though Malays have begun to drop the \"h\" in this word, as in other similar ones, but I see no reason to drop it because it is mute. Many Malays still sound the \"h\" in \"hitam\" and \"h\u0101yam,\" though the latter is more commonly sounded now without it.\nthis circumstance \"Merbau Saratus,\"(1) one of the limits of fishing rights on the Moar, took its name.\n\nRembau, like the rest of these countries, was, according to Mentra traditions, at first inhabited by the aboriginal tribes alone, and its first Penghulu was, like that of N\u00e2ning, appointed by the Dato' K\u00e9l\u00e2na P\u00e9tr\u00e2 of Sungei \u00dajong.(2)\n\nAnother local version is that Rembau was first settled by Batin B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra Sak\u00fbdei at H\u00fblu Rembau near G\u00fbnong Dato', and he it was who felled the mighty Merbau tree. According to native authority quoted by Newbold, B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra Sak\u00fbdei was the first chief of Sungei \u00dajong upon whom the title K\u00e9l\u00e2na P\u00e9tr\u00e2 was conferred, and was the son of a Batin,(3) and the following account of this origin was related to Newbold by the R\u00e2ja di R\u00e2ja of Sungei \u00dajong:\n\n\"In ancient times one of the princesses(4) of Sungei \u00dajong having had the presumption to laugh at the naked state of a Batin of the Jakuns, incurred his resentment, and was compelled irresistibly to follow him through thicket and brake, until, moved with compassion, her 'sans-culotte ma\u00eetre de danse' broke the spell and married her. The offspring of this sylvan union is said to be Sak\u00fbdei,(5) from whom descend the Penghulus of Sungei \u00dajong.\"\n\n\"B\u00ebduanda\" is the name of one of the chief aboriginal tribes in the South of the Peninsula, and two of the chief Rembau tribes bear the same name\u2014the B\u00ebduanda J\u00e2wa, and the B\u00ebduanda Jakun\u2014from which the Penghulu is alternately elected.\n\nThis alternate election is said to be due to a dispute in days\n\n---\n\n(1) The real origin of this name was probably that it was a very large tree, said to have 100 branches: cf. \"r\u00ebngas tujoh\" further down the Moar, which has seven stems branching from one root.\n\n(2) cf. infra with approval of Johor.\n\n(3) cf. infra.\n\n(4) The tradition, if the word \"princess\" is to be taken literally, is somewhat mixed (a not uncommon occurrence) about this, for there was no princely race in Sungei \u00dajong at the time; but it is a common practice to confer this title on women remarkable for beauty and fairness of complexion, and it may mean no more.\n\n(5) cf. with Rembau tradition infra, which makes him come from Johor.\ngone by between the two branches of the B\u0115duanda, each claiming the right to elect the P\u0115ngh\u00fblu, which was settled by the sovereign of Johor giving each the right alternately.\n\nHe at the same time gave distinctive titles to the P\u0115ngh\u00fblus\u2014to Titles. the one elected from the \u201cB\u0115duanda J\u00e2wa,\u201d that of \u201cS\u0115d\u00eea R\u00e2ja,\u201d to him of the \u201cB\u0115duanda Jakun\u201d that of \u201cL\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja.\u201d\n\nThe office is hereditary, descending on the side of the sister, as in N\u00e2ning and in all the M\u00eanangk\u00e2bau States. I attach a table shewing the constitution of the country, and giving an approximate estimate of the numbers of each tribe.\n\nIt will be noticed that the population is mixed.\n\nThe Siamese probably date from the time of the invasions by their ancestors recorded in the \u201cS\u0115j\u00e2rah,\u201d and which, if we may believe that work, took place shortly before the Portuguese took Malacca.\n\nAcheh and Malacca were at one time intimately connected, the latter, at first the superior, having subsequently become feudatory to the former.\n\nThe boundaries of R\u0115mbau with Malacca territory were defined Boundaries. by the Treaty of the 9th January, 1883, and were fixed as follows:\u2014\n\nKw\u00e2la Sungei J\u0115rneh,(1) Bukit B\u0115rtam,(2) Bukit J\u0115l\u00f4tong,(3) Bukit P\u00fbtus,(4) J\u00eerat Gunjei,(5) L\u00fbbok T\u00e2lan,(6) D\u00fbsun F\u0115ringgi(7) D\u00fbsun K\u0115par,(8) \u00dblu Sungga, Bukit P\u00fbtus.\n\n---\n\n(1) \u201cJ\u0115rneh,\u201d clear.\n(2) \u201cB\u0115rtam\u201d a palm-like reed, of which the leaves are used for thatch, and the stem split for walling houses.\n(3) \u201cJ\u0115l\u00f4tong,\u201d a fine g\u0115tah-bearing tree.

It now runs as follows:\u2014from Sempang to Bukit Mandi Angin, thence to P\u00ebrrentian Tinggi, and thence to G\u00fbnong Angsi. The boundary on the inland side towards Sri M\u00ebnanti, Inas or J\u00eblei, and Johol has shifted from time to time, G\u00fbnong P\u00e2sir, which is now under Sri M\u00ebnanti, is claimed as properly belonging to R\u00ebmbau, though in Newbold\u2019s time it was said to have originally belonged to Johol, and this last is confirmed by the aborigines, who are the best authorities. The boundaries with Sri M\u00ebnanti are said to be G\u00fbnong T\u00fbjoh, and G\u00fbnong L\u00eepat K\u00e2jang.\n\nThose with Johol, B\u00e2tu G\u00e2jah (on hill of that name), G\u00fbnong Dato\u2019, P\u00ebrrentian Lantei (or Tinggi) on Bukit \u00dalu \u00c2pi-\u00c2pi, and (including Tampin) B\u00e2tu B\u00ebr\u00e2pit (now claimed to be in Tampin, P\u00ebrrentian Manggis being said to be the right point, on Bukit K\u00fbda M\u00e2ti), J\u00ebram Kambing and Bukit P\u00fbtus.\n\nChief places.\n\nSempang, where the R\u00ebmbau and P\u00ebnar join to form the Linggi, and where we have now a Police Station on a small piece of land ceded to Government in 1874, was formerly one of the chief places in R\u00ebmbau; Kw\u00e2la P\u00ebdas, a few miles further up on the right bank, was another, but they have both been abandoned. At Bandar R\u00e2sau was the residence of the Yam T\u00fban M\u00fbda, and latterly of the late P\u00ebngh\u00fblu Haji Sa\u00efl. In Newbold\u2019s time the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu lived at Ch\u00ebmbong. The present P\u00ebngh\u00fblu resides at G\u00ebm\u00e2yun near Ch\u00ebngkau, where Haji Sa\u00efl had another residence. R\u00ebmbau, in proportion to its size, is, no doubt, the most populous of these native States, being probably about 11,000, exclusive of Tampin, Kru and T\u00ebbong; the details will be found in the table shewing the constitution of the country; in Newbold (1839) it is given at 9,000 including Tampin and Kru. The most populous part of the country is said to be inland at Sri L\u00ebmak and \u00dalu S\u00ebpri, but this is not confirmed by the numbers I have obtained. From the table first alluded to, it will be seen of what a mixed character the population\nThey likewise bear, among the Malays, the character of being pre-eminently treacherous. The G\u00e2dong district (lying between our frontier and G\u00fbnong Dato') near which Haji Mastafa lives, is said to be the harbour of robbers and cattle-lifters, but Haji Mastafa is too far advanced in years, too imbecile, and too much in the hands of others to do anything to improve matters; but under the new r\u00e9gime we may in time look for amendment.\n\nAs R\u00ebmbau used to be the place of installation of the Yam T\u00fban or Yang-di-p\u00f4rt\u00fban B\u00ebsar, it will not be out of place to deal here with the subject of the Yam T\u00fbans. The original States in the interior of this part of the Peninsula, according to tradition, before they became \"N\u00ebgri S\u00ebmbilan\" were K\u00eblang, J\u00ebl\u00ebbu, Sungei \u00dbjong and Johol, with seniority in the order given.\n\nThe \"N\u00ebgri S\u00ebmbilan\" are stated by Newbold, and probably correctly, as being originally as follows, K\u00eblang, J\u00ebl\u00ebbu, Sungei \u00dbjong, Johol, S\u00ebg\u00e2mat, N\u00e2ning, R\u00ebmbau, H\u00fblu Pahang (including S\u00ebrt\u00eeng and J\u00ebmpol) and J\u00eblei (in Pahang, adjoining J\u00ebl\u00ebbu). K\u00eblang soon fell under the domination of S\u00ebl\u00e2ngor.\n\nJohol originally included J\u00ebmpol and the whole watershed of the Moar as far as the P\u00e0long on one side and Mount Ophir on the other, having on the N. & W. common boundaries with J\u00ebl\u00ebbu, Sungei \u00dbjong, R\u00ebmbau and N\u00e2ning (the latter now included in Malacca).\n\nS\u00ebg\u00e2mat seems to have been absorbed by Johor a generation or two since. N\u00e2ning and R\u00ebmbau were children of Sungei \u00dbjong, and when the former of them came more directly under Dutch influence, Sri M\u00ebnanti, or more correctly H\u00fblu Moar, which had asserted independence of Johol, took its place in the confederation.\n\nAbout the middle of last century, the Dutch, in conjunction with the sovereign of Johor, Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah, who was suzerain of Yam Tuan B\u00ebsar.\n\n(1) There is of course another J\u00eblei also known as Inas, which, till a generation or two ago, formed part of Johol, nor is it clear that it is entirely separate now; this district could not have been one of the original \"N\u00ebgri S\u00ebmbilan;\" the title of its chief is the same as that of the Johol Dato', while that of the J\u00eblei in the text was Mahar\u00e2ja P\u00ebrba. No doubt with the decadence of the Johor dynasty, and the practical independence of Pahang, J\u00eblei ceased to be regarded as anything but a dependency of the B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra.\nof the Nine States, appointed Da\u00efng Kamb\u00f4ja, a Bugis Prince, as their chief.\n\nHis rule, however, was not approved of, and the P\u00ebngh\u00fblus of Sungei \u00dajong, Johol, R\u00ebmbau and H\u00fblu Moar invited, with the assistance of the Dutch and the consent of Johor, the Princes of the M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau dynasty to come over as their chiefs. Da\u00efng Kamb\u00f4ja, however, found support with some of the P\u00ebngh\u00fblus, and for a time hostilities ensued between the rival parties, but in the end R\u00e2ja M\u00ebl\u00e2war, the M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau Prince, prevailed, and Da\u00efng Kamb\u00f4ja withdrew to R\u00ecau, where he died in 1773. Thenceforward Johor, by common consent, had nothing more to do with the N\u00e9gri S\u00ebmbilan.\n\nR\u00e2ja M\u00ebl\u00e2war was then duly installed as Yang-di-p\u00ebrt\u00fban B\u00ebsar by the four P\u00ebngh\u00fblus of Sungei \u00dajong, Johol, R\u00ebmbau and H\u00fblu Moar (who were styled the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu B\u00eblantik from their office of installing the suzerainty in R\u00ebmbau, which was thenceforth called \u201cT\u00e2nah K\u00ebrjaan,\u201d i.e., the place where the business of installation is performed, not \u201ckar\u00e2ja-an,\u201d so it is said.)  \n\nThence the suzerain proceeded to Sri M\u00ebnanti, his place of residence, so named from the chief and B\u00e2tins there waiting to receive him in state, and it was called \u201cT\u00e2nah M\u00ebngandong.\u201d\n\nThe b\u00e2leis erected for the suzerain on his visits to the different States were constructed of peculiar form, which must not be altered. That in Sungei \u00dajong was called \u201cB\u00e2lei M\u00eblintang\u201d according to the best account, figuratively speaking from its P\u00ebngh\u00fblu being in a position to oppose any innovations attempted by the Yam T\u00fban; that in Johol \u201cB\u00e2lei B\u00ebrtingkat\u201d in the same way, being as it were, a third story on Sungei \u00dajong and R\u00ebmbau, and being next door to Sri M\u00ebnanti, would bring their representations right up to the Astana.\n\n(1) I am disposed to think it was \u201ckar\u00e2ja-an\u201d originally.\n(2) \u201cKandong,\u201d to be with child, in that sense to carry, to support, so this place bore or supported the Yam T\u00fban B\u00ebsar.\n(3) Not, I am informed, as Newbold states, because it was built at right angles to the river. The allegorical explanation given in the text is more in accordance with Malay ideas.\nThe real power in these States is vested with the P\u0113ngh\u00fblu, that Real power of the suzerain being nominal only. Newbold, from whose writings I have taken much of the account here given, states that, on the elevation of R\u0101ja M\u010dl\u0101war to the office of Yang-di-p\u010drt\u00fban, the following arrangement was agreed to between him and the P\u0113ngh\u00fblus: that he should assemble them on affairs of State and submit to a majority; that his maintenance be furnished equally by the inhabitants of the four States, each house contributing annually a gan-tang of padi, two cocoa-nuts and one s\u016bku (i.e., 13\u00bd cts.).\n\nOn the occasion of a death, marriage, or circumcision in the Royal Family, each P\u0113ngh\u00fblu was to send three buffaloes and to furnish a certain sum for distribution (probably for the benefit of the various officers who took part in the ceremonies).\n\nIn the case of a war also, the P\u0113ngh\u00fblu was expected to come forward with a certain contribution of men, arms, ammunition, and provisions.\n\nThe P\u0113ngh\u00fblu derived his revenue from his power of inflicting fines, and from contributions in kind made by the people of his State; he was said, too, to have the power, in other Malay countries reserved to the sovereign, of enforcing gratuitous labour, but I doubt if the power has been exercised, except to a very limited extent.(1) The respective positions of Yang-di-p\u010drt\u00fban and P\u0113ngh\u00fblu are also defined by the following verbal M\u010dnangk\u0101bau traditions:\n\nUndang-undang of the N\u0113gri S\u0113mbilan.(2)\n\n\u0100lam nen b\u0113r\u0101ja, l\u016bhak nen berp\u0113ngh\u00fblu, s\u016bku b\u0113rt\u016bha, anak b\u016bah ber\u012bbu b\u0101pa.\n\nThe kingdom is under the R\u0101ja, the district under the P\u0113ngh\u00fblu, the s\u016bku under the elder, and the members of the s\u016bku\n\n---\n\n(1) Such as helping in padi-planting and repairing the P\u0113ngh\u00fblu's house and fence.\n\n(2) i.e., of the \"P\u0113rp\u0101tih (or perhaps more properly \"P\u0101ti\" Pihang) Sab\u0101tang, opposed to which is the \"\u0101dat t\u0113m\u010dnggongan.\" I may refer to this in greater detail on a future occasion.\nunder the *ibu b\u0101pa*, (lit., father and mother) title of subordinate elder.\n\n*Sabingkah t\u0101nah terb\u0101lik, sa h\u0113lei irat k\u0101yu yang p\u016btus undang yang punya.*\n\nEvery clod of earth upturned, every slip of root snapped, is the P\u0113ngh\u00fblu\u2019s.\n\n*Deri h\u016blu \u0101y\u0113r m\u0113nyencheng sampei kahilir ombak m\u0113m\u0113chah, To\u2019 Bandar yang punya.*\n\nFrom the trickling source of the stream to the mouth when the waves break is the To\u2019 Bandar\u2019s.\n\n*Di p\u012bjak t\u0101nah, di langkah akar undang yang punya.*\n\nAll the soil and roots under foot belong to the P\u0113ngh\u00fblu.\n\n*Di sauk \u0101y\u0113r, di p\u0101tah ranting sa champak g\u0101lah di t\u0113pi t\u0113bing To\u2019 Bandar yang punya.*\n\nAll water taken, or boughs broken within reach of a punting-pole from the banks, belong to the To\u2019 Bandar.\n\n*Adat itu di anjak(1) l\u0101yu, di \u0101lih m\u0101ti.*\n\nNeglect of these customs will bring decay on the country, and if they are changed, destruction will result.\n\n*Adapun R\u0101ja itu ti\u0101da m\u0113mp\u016bnyai n\u0113gri dan ti\u0101da b\u016bleh mench\u016bkei kharajat, m\u0113lainkan b\u0113rka\u0101dilan saheja s\u0113rta p\u0113rm\u0101kananya duti sas\u016bku, b\u0113ras d\u016ba gantang, nior sat\u0101li.*\n\nNow the R\u0101ja does not own the country, nor can he levy taxes on its produce, but with him lies the final award of justice only, and he obtains a maintenance of a \u201cs\u016bku\u201d (12 cents), two gantangs (gallons) of rice and a string of (*i.e.*, 2) coconuts.

He was called in by the Rembau people to help in the conduct of hostilities against Yam Tuan Muda Raja Asil, and his son Raja Haji, who had given offence by a marriage that was considered unlawful.\n\n(From Menangkabau.)

And on the decease of a L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja P\u0115ngh\u00fblu the Dato\u2019 M\u0115rah Bangsa discharges similar functions.\n\nThe four L\u0115mb\u00e2ga in the low country are held senior to the four inland, and when one of the former dies, his insignia are half those displayed on the death of a P\u0115ngh\u00fblu, while those of an inland\nchief are slightly less; money, for instance, is not scattered on the way, nor are cloths spread on the path. The story of the origin of Dato' G\u00ebmpa, Dato' P\u00ebrba, and Dato' P\u00fbtih is as follows: There was a chief named Dato'(1) B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra Sak\u00fbdei(2) (his wife was a Jakun, daughter of B\u00e2tin Sar\u00eebu J\u00e2ya, she was called Princess Long-hair), who came from Johor with his followers to open R\u00ebmbau. After him came a man from M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau named Dato' L\u00ebteh, and he and his party became trusted to the Dato' B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra, and supported the people from Johor: they all settled at a place called K\u00ebbun L\u00e2da (Pepper Garden). After a time B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra Sak\u00fbdei had three children (female) the eldest named Dato' Bungkal, the next Dato' M\u00fbdek, and the youngest Dato' M\u00ebngk\u00fbdu. Later on he removed to Sungei \u00dajong, but he left his eldest child Dato' Bungkal in R\u00ebmbau with Dato' L\u00ebteh. Dato' L\u00ebteh belonged to the Mand\u00ecling branch of the B\u00e2tu Hampar S\u00fbku, and at the time all those of the B\u00e2tu Hampar S\u00fbku who came over from M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau to R\u00ebmbau put themselves under him.\n\nThere were five branches of the B\u00e2tu Hampar S\u00fbku from M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau who adhered to Dato' L\u00ebteh, viz., the Mand\u00ecling, the Ch\u00ebni\u00e2ga, the P\u00e2ya Bid\u00e2ra, the Pagar Chinchang, and the Agam.\n\nIn course of time Dato' L\u00ebteh looked round for a suitable husband for the daughter of B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra, and while he was considering the matter, there came a M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau man of the Ch\u00ebni\u00e2ga branch of the B\u00e2tu Hampar S\u00fbku named Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang, to ask for Dato' Bungkal as a wife; all the family were agreed to it, and they were married.\n\nIn due course Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang became father of a son, whom he named L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja.\n\nWhen he was about six years old, and the country had become populous, Dato' L\u00ebteh consulted with Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang, and suggested that it would be advisable for the latter to go to Johor and make over the country, for it belonged to the Dato' B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra\n\n(1) The account quoted supra calls him a B\u00e2tin, which would imply that he was himself a Jakun. The title of B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra is now in use amongst the Jakuns.\n(2) Probably because he came from the river of that name in Johor.\n(Sak\u00fbdei), the two Dato' thought that no one else could rule the country but L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja, for he was the grandson of the Dato' B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra.\n\nThen Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang went with Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam who was a M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau man with a Javanese wife, to Johor and there the son of Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang was appointed P\u00ebngh\u00fblu L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja, but while he was in his minority Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang undertook the duties, and was given the title of Dato' G\u00ebmpa Mahar\u00e2ja.\n\nThen came Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam complaining to Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang that he had obtained the P\u00ebngh\u00fbluship for his son and the administration of it for himself with a title, while he, Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam had got nothing for his trouble (the journey to Johor?). Then Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang returned to the presence the same day and represented the state of matters. The R\u00e2ja asked whether Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam had any daughters, and finding he had, decided that when he grew up L\u00eala Mahar\u00e2ja should marry Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam's daughter, and if he got a child, that child should be P\u00ebngh\u00fblu S\u00ebd\u00eea R\u00e2ja, whose duties should be undertaken by Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam, and Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam had the title of Dato' M\u00ebrah Bangsa conferred on him. They then returned to R\u00ebmbau. (1)\n\nIt was subsequently decided, in consultation with Dato' L\u00ebteh, that all the Ch\u00ebni\u00e2ga branch of the B\u00e2tu Hampar S\u00fbku should be handed over to the charge of the Dato' G\u00ebmpa Mahar\u00e2ja, i.e., Dato' L\u00eala B\u00e2lang. The other four branches of the s\u00fbku remained under Dato' L\u00ebteh, who was Dato' P\u00fbth\u00eeh, and have so continued to this day.\n\nThe descendants of Dato' Laut D\u00e2lam became the \"waris\" of the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu S\u00ebd\u00eea R\u00e2ja, because of the mother having been Javanese, and when the \"waris\" of both P\u00ebngh\u00fblus had become numerous, an elder was put over them with the name of Dato' P\u00ebrba, who was chosen alternately from each side, being at one time Jakun and the next J\u00e2wa.\n\nDato' P\u00fbth\u00eeh has always been considered to be connected with the\n\n(1) This and the other States were no doubt at the time of the taking of Malacca by the Portuguese inhabited by aborigines only. These latter assisted in the defence of Malacca with their primitive weapons.\nDato' P\u00ebrba up to the present time, because Dato' L\u00ebteh brought up Dato' Bungkal, and Dato' P\u00fbtih is descended from Dato' L\u00ebteh, and Dato' P\u00ebrba is descended from Dato' Bungkal.\n\nThe following account is given of the origin of the name \"L\u00eema S\u00fbku\" in the low country:\n\nIn the time of P\u00ebnh\u00fblu K\u00e2sir a woman of the Dato' P\u00ebrba's Origin of Li-people was taken to wife by a man of the Mungkar tribe in Tampin, but his people did not pay the marriage dowry. On this the Dato' P\u00ebrba and Dato' P\u00fbtih after consultation summoned their people together and went to Tampin to demand the dowry; they kept up the attack for about a fortnight, but without success; then Dato' P\u00fbtih and Dato' P\u00ebrba called to their aid Dato' Mahar\u00e2ja S\u00ebn\u00e2ra, Dato' L\u00eala Angsa, and Dato' Ganti Mahar\u00e2ja: these three agreed to help them in the affair they were engaged in, and assembled all their people and attacked Tampin, which was defeated at their first attempt; the Mungkar people admitted the dowry claim, and the matter was settled. Then the five Dato' returned to R\u00ebmbau, and there they agreed to act together always, and they had a feast and slaughtered buffaloes, and P\u00ebnh\u00fblu K\u00e2sir removed to a place called Mesjid B\u00e2tu P\u00fbtih, where there was a great assembly and the five chiefs mentioned registered an oath with the spilling(1) of blood and under the Kor\u00e2n, that they would remain five elders with one L\u00ebmb\u00e2ga, each with his own people, but of one mind, whether advantage or injury should accrue, they should share it as long as the sun and moon, which cannot change, endure. Which-ever of the five chiefs should change or depart from the above solemn agreement, he would be punished by the testimony of the thirty books of the Kor\u00e2n, the Majesty of Pagar R\u00fbyong would fall upon him, and the weapon K\u00e2wi would make an end of him. This was the origin of the five s\u00fbkus, and thenceforth Dato' P\u00ebng-h\u00fblu K\u00e2sir spoke of the four and five s\u00fbkus, in the low country, with respect to the \"b\u00ebrampat berl\u00eema s\u00fbku,\" and the \"b\u00ebrampat b\u00ebrs\u00ebmbilan s\u00fbku\" inland. It is said that the first settling of this\n\n(1) Each party puts some of his blood into a cup, and then each dips his finger into the blood and conveys it to his mouth.\npart of the country was agreed on by three chiefs from M\u0115nangk\u00e2bau; one Dato\u2019 Laut of P\u00e2ya Kumboh (1) selected a stream called L\u00e2yang; from him Dato\u2019 Si Mahar\u00e2ja (2) is descended: another Dato\u2019 P\u00fbth from Sri L\u0115mak took the stream called L\u00fbbok R\u00fbsa; from him is descended Dato\u2019 Sinda Mahar\u00e2ja;(2) another Dato\u2019 Inda P\u0115tr\u00e2, a man of B\u00e2tu B\u00e2lang took the stream of Bintongan; he was the ancestor of Dato\u2019 And\u00eeka.(2)\n\nThese three all began planting in the places named. They claimed from the sources of the streams to their junction with the main stream. While engaged in clearing, they heard the sound of many trees falling down stream within the range of their claims, on going to see the cause, they found one Dato\u2019 P\u00fbteh K\u0115p\u00e2la a Sri M\u0115l\u0115nggang man of M\u0115nangk\u00e2bau occupied in clearing. (Dato\u2019 Mand\u0115lika (2)descends from him.) The place was called B\u00e2tu Hampar. Then there was a dispute between the three chiefs and Dato\u2019 P\u00fbteh K\u0115p\u00e2la, the former claiming from the gullies to the mouths of their streams, saying they had settled there first; the latter claimed the same, and their claims were equally strong, for they had been all recognised from Johor. Later on authority came from the P\u0115ngh\u00fblu dividing the land between them, and making the boundary from B\u00e2tu M\u0115nunnggul to Tungg\u00e2l M\u0115rbau in the B\u00e2tu B\u0115sar jungle, and thence to Tungg\u00e2l Ch\u00e2char, on to Kw\u00e2la \u00c2nak \u00c2y\u0115r H\u00eetam in the S\u0115pri stream; whoever went up the Leng stream must be under Dato\u2019 Si Mahar\u00e2ja, whoever went up the L\u00fbbok R\u00fbsa stream must be under Dato\u2019 Sinda Mahar\u00e2ja, and any one settling up the Bintongan stream must be under Dato\u2019 And\u00eeka. So the T\u00eega B\u00e2tu people under Nang B\u0115sar, who went up the Bintongan, were under the jurisdiction of Dato\u2019 And\u00eeka. So likewise in the case of the S\u0115pri, Dato\u2019 P\u0115ngh\u00fblu Uban brought two men from Johor, Dato\u2019 Chindei Lu\u00e2tan (a B\u0115duanda, from whom descends Dato\u2019 S\u0115tir Mahar\u00e2ja), and a M\u0115nangk\u00e2bau man of the P\u00e2ya Bid\u00e2ra branch of the B\u00e2tu Hampar, (from whom S\u00fbtan B\u0115ndah\u00e2ra is descended), and told them to settle on the S\u0115pri. They worked\n\n(1) Name of a rush-like grass growing in swampy ground.\n(2) L\u0115mbaga \u201cdi-d\u00e2rat.\u201d\nwith the three chiefs, Dato\u2019 Si Mahar\u00e2ja, Dato\u2019 Sinda Mahar\u00e2ja, and Dato\u2019 And\u00eeka, and they became five s\u00fbkus, and were called \u201cb\u00earampat berl\u00eema s\u00fbku\u201d being confined within the boundaries above-mentioned.\n\nFurther down stream came Dato\u2019 M\u00ebngi\u00e2ng of the Mungkar s\u00fbku from M\u00e2chap,(1) and a M\u00ebnangk\u00e2bau man, i.e., Dato\u2019 Mahar\u00e2ja Inda, making three with Dato\u2019 P\u00fbtih K\u00ebp\u00e2la, i.e., Dato\u2019 Mand\u00ebl\u00eeka, and these were called three elders and one L\u00ebmb\u00e2ga.\n\nThe origin of the appellation \u201cb\u00ebrs\u00ebmbilan\u201d is that they descended from nine mothers in these three s\u00fbkus, four in the Sri M\u00ebl\u00ebnggang, three in the Mungkar, in the T\u00e4nah Datar (2) two; these worked together, together bore disgrace and shame.\n\nThe eight L\u00ebmb\u00e2ga of s\u00fbkus, four in the low country and four inland, hold the next position in the State to the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu, and in all affairs of consequence he is obliged to consult them and to follow the opinion of the majority, and no treaties or agreements affecting the country generally are valid without their signature. The four Orang B\u00ebsar, though not heads of s\u00fbkus, still, from their position as \u201cwaris\u201d and consequent eligibility for the P\u00ebngh\u00fbluship, are able to exercise considerable influence. But subordinate chiefs of intriguing character are, of course, often found to have an influence greatly disproportioned to their official position. The Dato\u2019 P\u00ebrba, the foremost of the \u201cduablas s\u00fbku,\u201d also occupies an influential position, from his being the head of the joint s\u00fbku of B\u00ebduanda Jakun and B\u00ebduanda J\u00e2wa, from which he, like the P\u00ebngh\u00fblu, is alternately elected. He is also eligible for the P\u00ebngh\u00fbluship. It will also be noticed that his s\u00fbku is by far the most numerous, being double any of the others.\n\nThe soil of R\u00ebmbau resembles that of N\u00e2ning generally. The Nature of same may be said of its physical configuration; the country is of country. an undulating character, the depressions being mostly \u201cs\u00e2wah,\u201d and the rising ground kampongs or secondary jungle. The hills, except near the Malacca frontier, seem to be of less elevation than in N\u00e2ning. Bukit B\u00ebsar is the only mountain in the country, exclu-\n\n(1) In N\u00e2ning.\n(2) Datar, i.e. flat.\nsive of those in the ranges which divide it from Snngei \u00dajong, Sri M\u00e9nanti and Johol.\n\nThe \"s\u00e2wah\" or padi-fields are extensive, but a good deal is now out of cultivation, owing to the fatal cattle disease which has raged during the last three years, and has carried off almost all the buffaloes. I saw very few indeed.\n\nA large proportion of the \"s\u00e2wah\" have, however, been planted out with padi this season, the fields having been prepared by means of a large wooden \"changkul\" or hoe, which is much used by the R\u00ebmbauans.\n\nThe \"s\u00e2wah\" divisions (\"jalor\" or \"p\u00eatak\") strike me as being a good deal smaller than those in our territory, probably owing to the fact that they are cultivated by hand, and the \"batas\" or dividing ridges appear much better kept.\n\nThe soil of the \"s\u00e2wah\" is of a lighter colour than is common in Malacca and there is more tendency to sand and quartz grit in it.\n\nThe yield appears to be high, averaging eighty to ninety, and in some places runs as high as a hundred-fold. At G\u00e2dong I noticed the \"s\u00e2wah\" soil was a very white clay with an admixture of grit, and was told it was particularly good and produced a hundred-fold. In this, as in other Malay countries, a certain amount of \"ladang,\" or high-land cultivation, of padi takes place, more particularly when circumstances are unfavourable for the \"s\u00e2wah\" or wet cultivation.\n\nThere is no tin worked in R\u00ebmbau, though it was acknowledged that it existed, but was not worked for fear of the water flowing from the workings poisoning the \"s\u00e2wah\" and preventing the cultivation of padi. At \u00dalu P\u00ebdas tin has been worked, but I heard it had been given up owing to rival claims.\n\nGranite is the prevailing rock, but quartz occasionally appears cropping up to a limited extent, and loose fragments are found in the streams. The soil on the mountains of Tampin and Dato' is good, of light brown, occasionally clayey. The variety of ferns on G\u00fbnong Dato' was considerable. The Tampin soil is said to be richer than any in Malacca, except that in the M\u00e2chap district\n## Constitution of Rembau\n\n### Title\n\n| S\u016bka | No. of Houses | Nationality |\n|------|--------------|-------------|\n| Di b\u014druh, or low country. | | |\n| G\u014dmpa Mahar\u0101ja. | B\u0101tu Hampar.

G\u00fbnong Dato' Tampin is, to judge by the eye, 200 feet higher.\n\nThe summit of G\u00fbnong Dato' is very peculiar, being formed of immense rocks, some 50 or 60 feet high resting on a space which is barely enough to support them; between the two main rocks hang suspended 2 or 3 smaller rocks, under which is sufficient room for a large party. On one of the smaller rocks in this chamber below has been placed an earthen jar into which water trickles from above; this water is often preserved by the devotees, who are constantly making the ascent to pay their vows, as having peculiar and sacred properties. On the top of the massive rocks first mentioned are smaller rocks which form the actual summit, and on one of these is to be seen a small hollow, shaped something like the print of a human foot. This footprint is attributed to the P\u00ebtr\u00ee G\u00fbnong L\u00eadang (Princess of Mount Ophir)\u2014a fairy being, who touched here on her way from Tanjong T\u00fban, whence she had taken flight in her magic robes from the importunities of the crew of her late lord Nakh\u00f4da R\u00e2gam, whom she had in a moment of irritation slain with a prick of her needle. To this footprint the mountain owes its name of Dato', and its reputation as a \"kr\u00e2mat.\" There is only one tree among these rocks, and that not in the summit, so that there is a clear view all round, except where the mountains,\nlying close inland, intervene and shut out Sri M\u0115nanti, J\u0115lei, Johol, and the Moar River.\n\nI was fortunate in having a fine clear day on G\u00fbnong Dato,' and was able to take a number of bearings with a prismatic compass, including a certain number of places in R\u0115mbau territory lying at my feet.\n\nThe result is embodied in the accompanying rough chart, which has of course no pretensions to accuracy, but may perhaps serve to give a better idea of the country than has hitherto been attainable.\n\nOn a further occasion I hope to give some further account of the chiefs of this State and their subordinates, as well as of their functions, and some of the local customs.\n\nD. F. A. HERVEY.\nTHE TAWARAN AND PUTATAN RIVERS,\nNORTH BORNEO.\n\nThe following sketch of these two rivers, taken from the notes of a trip which the writer had the pleasure of undertaking recently in the company of Mr. A. H. Everett, known for his researches into the ornithology of the Philippines, do not claim to be more than a cursory survey, but may contain some elements of interest, as treating of two rivers that have remained practically unvisited since the respective visits of Mr. Burbidge, the botanist, on his journey to Kina Balu, and of the present Sir Spenser St. John, in one of his numerous exploring expeditions.\n\nThe Tawaran river is reported to take its rise in the mountains flanking the great mountain of Kina Balu to the South. An affluent of it, however, called by the local Dusuns the Sungei Damit, which flows into the main stream on its true right bank at a point some few miles only from the sea, is said by them to flow more from the North of East, and may, therefore, be surmised to take its rise from the western flank of the big mountain. The mouth of the Tawaran opens to the westward, and is partly closed by the invariable sandy bar which obstructs the entrances of all the rivers of this part of Borneo.\n\nStarting from the island of Gaya, where the North Borneo Company have a station, our route lay across the bay of that name, past the mouth of the Menggatal, or Kabatuan river, which, debouching to the westward, has good anchorage in deep water off its mouth, to a landing place called Gantisan situate in the bight of Sapangar bay, where formerly the vil-\nlage of Gant\u00eesan stood. A low neck of land separates Sapan-\ngar bay at this point from the adjacent basin of the Karimbu-\nnai river. Coal is reported by the natives at this point. The\nwater supply is good, and there is secure anchorage close in-\nshore protected from both monsoons. A very slight cutting\nwould suffice to pierce this narrow collar, and would thus\nrender Gant\u00eesan, the natural outlet of the trade of the Karim-\nbunai, Mengk\u00e2bong and Taw\u00e2ran rivers. The soil of the\nwhole of this dividing ridge is apparently lateritic sandstone.\n\nDescending into the valley of the Karimbunai river, a short\nwalk down its left bank brought us to the village of that name,\nthe headquarters of Pang\u00earan RAUP, the Governor of the dis-\ntrict, a feudatory of the Sultan of Brunei and a member of\nthe former Brunei royal family. On examining an outcrop\nof the strata on the river bank, the strike proved to be N.E.\nwith a dip of about $80^\\circ$ bed rock sandstone. After an inter-\nview with the old Pang\u00earan, a boat was procured in which we\npaddled down to the common mouth of the Karimbunai and\nMengk\u00e2bong rivers. This is remarkably narrow and would\nseem to have been contracted by the formation of a high sand-\nbank which has been, and is being, pushed southwards by the\ninfluence of the north-east monsoon and of the heavy swell\nfrom the China Sea, the action of the opposing monsoon being\ngreatly neutralized by the protection afforded by the project-\ning bluff of Gaya head to the south-westward. The entrance\nis said to be fairly* deep, but would probably be impractica-\nble in heavy north-westerly winds. Paddling up the broad\nexpanse of the Mengk\u00e2bong river, our course, on the average,\nbeing about E. by N., we came upon some fine reaches of\nwater. Numerous channels branched off from the main one,\nwhich was flanked to the northward by mangrove growth, and\nto the south and east by grassy hills, while a bold range tow-\nered up to the S.E. A few miles further brought us to a\npoint at which the river expands into a large, lake-like sheet\nof water, from the upper end of which a perfect network of\nbroad channels diverge, dotted in all directions with Bajau\nvillages extending far away up to the foot of the mountains.\n\n* Eight feet or so.\nThe entire population of this district is Bajau, and is supported mainly by fishing, a little hill paddy being grown as well.\n\nThe Mengk\u00e2bong \"river,\" so called, bears evidences of having been originally an inlet of the sea dotted with sandstone islands, which have, for the most part, become connected by the rising of the land and by the silting up of the basin itself, the blocking up of the mouth of which, by sand-bars, has led to its assuming its present form. In general features, it much resembles the Sul\u00e2man basin, no great distance to the north of it.\n\nAfter threading this watery labyrinth for some hours we penetrated a narrow channel and landed at its head, at a small kampong called Brungis, whence a walk of about an hour over a low ridge, and then across a broad plain, brought us to the banks of the swiftly flowing Taw\u00e2ran river, which at this point is a fine stream rolling its turgid yellow flood along between sandy banks of medium height. The Taw\u00e2ran here intersects a level plain of large extent and sandy soil, dotted with homesteads surrounded by plantations of cocoa-nuts, and here and there under paddy cultivation. This plain is bounded by the sea to the W., by the mountains of the upper Taw\u00e2ran to the E., and to the S. by the low ridge mentioned above, which divides the respective water-sheds of the Taw\u00e2ran and the Mengk\u00e2bong. On the northern bank the plain apparently extends to the foot of the mountains separating the Taw\u00e2ran from the Sul\u00e2man basin. Our route from Brungis lay East, East by North and then North, and the portion of the plain traversed had a general fall towards the East of North, but a very slight one.\n\nOn striking the river, our course lay upstream for some considerable distance, at first over level ground, and then, when the limits of the plain had been reached, and the true valley of the Taw\u00e2ran entered, along the steep flanks of hills abutting on the stream, where a false step would often have precipitated one into the flood below. Fields of paddy, groves of cocoa-nut trees, herds of buffaloes, together with pigs, goats and poultry, betokened a well-to-do and prosperous population. Sugar-cane appeared to thrive, but the specimens seen were\nnot well planted and were short in the staple. Some of the Dusun homesteads dotted about this Taw\u00e2ran plain possessed quite a home-like air of tranquillity and repose about them. Nestling in the grateful shade of cocoa-nut groves, bowered in broad-leaved bananas, and girdled with green paddy fields, they had a pleasant look to the tired traveller's eye. Snowy paddy birds dotted the verdant pastures, huge adjutant birds flew on lazy wing from point to point. The scene was not without its idyllic charms, nor were home-associations wanting in the familiar-sounding caw of the Bornean crow (Corvus validus) as it was borne to the ear on the breeze.\n\nThe district towards the mouth of the Taw\u00e2ran is called the Timbalang country, and has a Bajau colony settled in it. Above this point the Dusun population prevails, though a Bajau house may be found here and there. The tribal designation of the Taw\u00e2ran Dusuns is Latud, and it may here be mentioned that that of the Dusuns up the Tampassuk river further north, is Tinalal; that of the Dusuns in the vicinity of the North Borneo Company's Station of Kudat, on the north coast, Mem\u00e2gun (vide the late Mr. F. Witt); while that of the Dusuns up the Labuk river, on the east coast, is Tambenua.\n\nReaching at sunset the house of a Bajau named Ibu, who had settled down there and had taken a Taw\u00e2ran Dusun maiden to wife, we put up for the night, our slumbers soothed by the potent influence of some tuak, or cocoa-nut toddy, pressed upon us by the proprietor of a neighbouring Dusun house. This district we were told was called Telibong.\n\nAn early start on the morrow down the bank of the river, brought us to the village of Liong Liongan, the Taw\u00e2ran at our starting point flowing from N.E. with a rapid current. The bed rock of this region is sandstone. Proceeding some distance further down stream we accomplished a perilous transit in a gobong, or dug-out canoe of the very slenderest dimensions. C'\u00e9tait un mauvais quart d'heure, for neither of us could swim, and the river, swollen by flood water, resembled a boiling, eddying Maelstr\u00f6m, but fortune was kind, and on safely reaching the right bank, a short walk brought us to the Sungei Damit, which we struck a few hundred yards above\nits confluence with the main river. The Sungei Damit is a deep, sluggish stream shut in by high muddy banks. Here we halted at the house of the Datu Bandara and Tumonggong\u2014a large, long structure of the ordinary Dusun barn-like type. A sago extracting apparatus was set up on the river bank here, in which product a moderate trade exists there. I had, en route, noticed cocoa-nut and areca palms, bananas, keladi, and paddy in profusion. The country is in fact very prosperous, in despite of the ravages of the memorable flood of January, 1883, which was very destructive in the Tawaran district. From the Datu Tumonggong's conversation, it appeared that a tamu, or market, was held at a place two days' journey up the Sungei Damit, to which the people of Kiau\u2014the village on the flanks of Kina Balu, visited by Messrs. Burbidge and Spenser St. John at different times\u2014came down to trade. The route was, however, at present closed, owing to a blood-feud.\n\nReturning in the afternoon to Ibu's house, we started, after a light repast, for Tempeluri, a village some distance up the Tawaran, reaching the house of a Datu Massudi at about 3 P.M. The Tawaran is here a fine rapid stream, bordered on its true right bank by wooded hills, and on its left by level ground well planted with cocoa-nuts, with paddy fields beyond, bounded by hills in the back-ground. The height of the river rendering it impossible for us to proceed to Bawang or Lokob, we returned to our head-quarters in Ibu's house at the foot of the hill of Tagerangan, after a tramp of altogether some 15 miles or more. In the evening a native of Kiau, named Bungaran, arrived. This man, in the course of conversation, declared that no man had ever yet reached the true summit of Kina Balu, which, he asserted, is inaccessible from every side when once a certain elevation has been reached, the remainder of the ascent being sheer precipice. He added that there is a Dusun legend to the effect that a deep lake exists on the top. This is probably only a deduction on their part, drawn from the existence of perennial cataracts dashing down the topmost precipices, which form a magnificent feature in the landscape on the Tawaran.\n\nThe climate in the Tawaran valley is superb. At 5 A.M\nthe thermometer will often stand as low as 68\u00b0, while the keen, cold air blowing down from the black towering summits that cut the eastern sky-line, invigorates the frame and braces the muscles for the coming labours of the day. It would require a poet's pen to do anything like justice to the gorgeous scenic effects and grand transformation scenes, as the orb of day rises behind the jagged mountain barrier. The whole country is so well opened up, that the monsoons have free play, and fever should be comparatively unknown. The soil may be described as sandy near the sea, but of every quality as one proceeds inland. Kina Balu bears about E.S.E. from the plain near the river mouth.\n\nAn hour's walk brought us back to Brungis, where we had left our pakerangan, or native boat, and some five hours more brought us to Gaya island, whence a start was effected early on the ensuing morning for the mouth of the Putatan river.\n\nThe Putatan river has two mouths\u2014the Pat\u00e2gas mouth, which lies a little to the E. of S. of the most southerly point of Gaya island at a distance, in a direct line, of about five miles, roughly estimated, and about half that distance south of Tanjong Aru; and its main mouth, Tel\u00eepuk, which lies a short distance to the southward of Tanjong Togorongan. The former is the most accessible entrance, the main kuala having a very gradually shoaling foreshore, and but little depth of water on it at high water. The Pat\u00e2gas mouth opens to the westward and has a depth of about one fathom at low water. A short distance from it, to the northward, off Tanjong Aru, there is good anchorage close inshore for prahus and small boats, completely sheltered from both monsoons by an outlying sand-bank. The Putatan river is an appanage of the Sultan of Brunei, and of Pang\u00earan Muda Binjai's family.\n\nA paddle of little over a mile and a half, passing en route, on the true right bank, the confluence of the little river Munglab, brings one to a small Bajau village, the head of which is Datu Kilan. From this point the Pat\u00e2gas flows more from the S.E., and becomes very narrow and tortuous up to its divergence from the main Putatan, rather more than a mile further on, where (and situate therefore at the apex of\nthe delta of the Putatan) is a large Bajau kampong containing some hundreds of inhabitants. Directly above this the Dusun country begins. The head of this village is Datu Setia. On landing some two miles further up, I found Gaya island bearing about due North. A cursory survey shewed a fine open cultivated country, bounded some two miles off to the eastward by the foot-hills of the coast range, and dotted here and there with wooded knolls. The river maintains an average width of some seventy or eighty yards, with a winding course, whose main axis lies about East and West. It carries a good volume of water with a considerable amount of matter held in solution. From native report, it is not subject to severe floods, which may perhaps be attributed to its having two mouths to discharge by. Passing at 2 p.m. a considerable Dusun village, in which the very large house of Datu Barukis, the headman, is conspicuous, we fixed our head-quarters half an hour later, at the house of one Kawan, a Dusun, at a small hamlet named Kandayan. From this point \"Castle Peak\" (of the Admiralty Chart) bore S by W., while the right hand flank of Kina Balu bore 80\u00b0 E. of N.\n\nAfter a pleasant walk across a fine open country to the house of a Chinaman named Ah Kong, whose occupation is that of distilling arrack from rice, we were glad on our return to settle down for the night. A daughter of our host being ill with fever, I administered some medicine to her, and a regular smoking divan was then formed, all the men, and the ladies also, joining the circle. The Dusun in this respect presents a favourable contrast to the sedate, if not \"dour\" Malay. He and all his belongings, male and female, after doing the honours, will freely sit down with you and join in the conversation. These Putatan Dusuns are by far the best type of their race that I have met. They are tall, well-developed, clean-skinned, bright and intelligent looking people, who look what they are\u2014well-fed and well-to-do. Among the bevy of damsels that sat around, were some by no means unprepossessing in appearance, with bright dark eyes, open laughing countenances, clean limbs and well-turned figures. A chorus of laughter was evoked by my desperate endeavours to explain to an intelligent young Du-\nsun that the earth is round like an orange, and not only revolves on its own axis, but round the sun also. Our merriment was, however, interrupted by the ravings of the fever-stricken patient, who had become delirious. Thereupon the entire company rose and adjourned to the long and broad verandah, when a most curious \"function\" was performed. Damar torches were lighted, and all the men squatted down in a circle outside the door of the patient's room. In the centre sat her brother, back to back with another relation. A tremendous din was then struck up by the beating of numerous gongs, hanging along the walls, in a kind of measured cadence, varied at intervals by a loud shout raised by all the men present. A youngish woman then commenced to dance with a slow measured step and swaying to and fro of her body, round the inside of the circle. In her left hand she held a stick, furnished at one extremity with a curious arrangement of black feathers. In her right she held a naked sword. With this latter she continually made passes, bringing the blade down edgeways between the heads of the two sitting men, and then striking the feathered stick with it. This continued for some time. She then touched the heads of all present with her \"fetish\" rod, which was then discarded and a sarong taken up in its place. With this she danced slowly round and round, holding it out extended in front of her. All this time the shouts were being vigorously given forth at intervals, while the clanging of gongs was deafening. The woman then made up the sarong into a turban which she slowly brought down over the head of the sick woman's brother, letting it rest there for a few seconds. She then removed it and laid it gently down behind her, and the ceremony was over. A torch-light procession of travelling natives, passing the verandah just at this juncture, lent an additionally weird effect to the conclusion of this curious ceremony, whose strange rites and obscure origin may perhaps be admitted to warrant my description of it. Doubtless the idea is the casting of the evil spirit out of the sick person, and the good effects of the pills administered to the patient were probably set down to the credit of the ceremony.\n\nA remarkable thing in this district is the neatness and\ncomparative cleanliness of the bulk of the houses. Instead of the objectionable split nibong, the floors are made of beaten out bamboo, the walls, of the same material, neatly plaited, chess-board pattern. There are regular sleeping compartments, and a fine broad verandah runs from end to end of the house along the front of it. Our beds were arranged in the main body of the house, a fine lofty, airy apartment where dirt and mosquitoes were equally conspicuous by their absence. We noticed as a curious fact in these Dusuns, that they made use, in talking, of the letter Z, which would seem to point to their affinity to the Mil\u00e2naus of Sarawak.\n\nAn early start on the ensuing morning brought us, after a seven-mile tramp, among the foot-hills of the coast range. We were here some twelve miles, or more, inland. On our way we passed the debouchure of the river Sugut, which joins the Putatan on its proper left bank, and further up, on the opposite side, the confluence of the Pagunan river, which is the true Putatan, the river bearing that name from this point, which we followed up, being in reality only a small tributary stream flowing from S.E. Pursuing our way up the valley of the latter, we reached our destination, a house at the foot of the hills, tenanted by an old Chinaman and his Dusun wife and daughter. We were here beyond the limits of the highly cultivated Putatan valley, and in a lovely country, at the point where the district of the Dusuns of the plain, marches with that of the Orang Tag\u00e1s, or Hill Dusuns. The Putatan valley is, without exception, the finest and most highly cultivated district in North Borneo. Without visiting it, it would be difficult for any one, accustomed only to such cultivation, or the lack of it, as is met with in other parts of North Borneo, to realize that, side by side with such districts, there exists one in which rice cultivation has been carried to the highest pitch of perfection, where every foot of soil is tilled, where substantial, and in many cases ornamental, land-marks of wood and stone have been erected all over the face of the country, and where the price of land ranges from $40 an acre or thereabouts. This country must be the granary of Brunei. The acreage of paddy is immense. One\nfield, or rather plain, must, at a rough estimate, have been some 600 acres in extent, the whole being marked off by the land-marks of the different proprietors. It was intersected by the Longhap, a small, canal-like stream. The water supply for purposes of irrigation is unlimited, the levels are well laid out and the banks neatly kept up, a path running along the ridge of each. It would, however, be of great benefit to the district were a fresh stock of paddy introduced, larger in the ear, the present stock being small in the grain and shewing signs of deterioration. There are some 80 to 100 Chinese settled on the Putatan, the bulk of them being the descendants of former Chinese settlers, who have intermarried with the Dusuns and shew evidence of mixed blood. These Chinese are not agriculturists, nor, as far as I could learn, landed proprietors, but are principally distillers, manufacturing arrack, which they barter with the Dusuns. The soil is decidedly superior to that of the valleys of the Papar and Kinanis rivers to the South, and there is an almost total absence of swamp, owing, no doubt, to the country being all cleared, and the complete system of drainage. The surface configuration is that of a practically level plain studded with numerous small hills, on which the timber has wisely been left standing. The paddy fields extend up to the very bases of these. In moist tracts and along the lines of water-courses, some sago is grown, but the quantity of this is inconsiderable. Some five piculs of gutta come down from the interior monthly, and tobacco, camphor, beeswax and armadillo skins form the staple exports. The Brunei Government imposes a tax of from $6 to $9 per head per annum, or about $200 for each pangkalan, or village landing-place. The number of the villages is remarkable, and in some parts of the upper portion of the river, they lie in sight of, and sometimes quite contiguous to, one another. The general aspect of the whole country is that of an orderly, industrious and civilized community, and a very fair prospect unfolds itself to the eye of one looking forth from the summit of one of the picturesque little hills above referred to, over the far stretching expanse of green paddy plains, clustering villages and detached homesteads nestling amid their\nsurroundings of tall cocoa-nut and spreading sago palms, while dotted over the plain, the numerous wooded knolls rise like islands amid a sea of green. It is a smiling landscape abounding in soft beauty, and backed by a range of noble mountains, with the father of them all\u2014the towering Kina Balu\u2014rearing his lofty mass on the northern horizon. Indeed, for general evidences of prosperity, plenty and industry, and of well applied principles of cultivation carried out on a most exhaustive and extensive scale, the Putatan district may be fairly said to be unequalled in the whole of North Borneo. The formation of the lowlands and foot-hills is sandstone of recent formation.\n\nThe Putatan does not apparently drain any of the Kina Balu water-shed, although the river, which, as before stated, goes by the name of the Pagunan above the confluence of the Putatan river so called, can, I was informed, be ascended for fifteen days. The Orang Tag\u00e1s, a hill Dusun people, who wear the chaw\u00e1t, or bark loin-cloth, and who are found at the head-waters of all the rivers in N.W. Borneo, from the Taw\u00e2ran to the Kim\u00e2nis, inhabit the upper portion of the river down to its debouchure from the main coast range.\n\nI noticed a curious musical instrument, a species of guitar, called by the Dusuns tonkoonong. This is made of a piece of large bamboo about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet long and has 6 strings which are formed by the detaching and raising thin strips of the bamboo sheath. These are tightened at will by pushing a piece of wood along underneath each towards its point of junction with the bamboo.\n\nTheir customs are much the same as those of the bulk of the Dusun race. An intending bridegroom has to pay a marriage portion for his bride. When a father dies, his lands and property go to his sons, the eldest getting the largest share. The widow has no share, but has a right to the usufruct of the estate during her life, and the daughters have a claim for support upon the estate until marriage. At his death, a Dusun, if a poor man, is buried in the ground, a small house being erected over his grave, from and above which various coloured calico streamers are dependent. If a rich man, his body is buried in a valuable old jar. The value of some of\nthese old jars is very great, amounting in some instances to hundreds of dollars, and the expenses of the funeral obsequies of an opulent Dusun chief often amount to over $600, buffaloes being killed and eaten, *tuak* consumed in large quantities, *obat* (fetish ceremonies) performed, etc.\n\nAlthough the Putatan cannot properly be described as a sago river, its delta would afford a large area of land suitable for planting the sago palm, the land being low-lying and swampy, and abutting on a good water-way on either side. The highlands of the interior are easily accessible up its valley, the climate is salubrious and pleasant, the population large and well-disposed, but the lands along its banks are firmly held and highly valued, and it is doubtful whether any area of such land could ever be brought into the market.\n\nThe course of the main Putatan, or Telipuk, to the sea, from the point at which the Patagas branch diverges from it, is somewhat tortuous but has a good depth of water. Its mouth, however, as already stated, is shoal and difficult of entry. An examination of an outcrop of the strata on its right bank, on the way down, shewed the strike to be S.E. with a dip of about 80\u00b0. A mangrove growth extends up both banks for a short distance from the *kuala*, and also along the coast on either side, and there is no beach available for landing on. This is not the case with the Patagas mouth which has a sandy beach and true jungle close to the sea with however mangroves inside.\n\nAs regards the state of cultivation of the tract watered by it, the Putatan may be fairly classed as the show river of North Borneo.\n\nS. ELPHINSTONE DALRYMPLE.\n\n[Erratum:\u2014Page 270, line 2, for COO read 6,000.]\nPROPOSED ENGLISH-MALAY DICTIONARY.\n\nStudents of Malay, among whom many members of this Society may be included, will learn with interest that Mr. H. C. Klinkert, one of the best Malay scholars in Holland, has it in contemplation to publish an English-Malay Dictionary, adapted from his new Dutch-Malay Dictionary now passing through the press.\n\nWhether the English edition will, or will not, be produced, will depend upon the measure of support which may be depended on. A certain number of subscribers should be forthcoming, in the first instance, to ensure that a work involving so much labour will not result in pecuniary loss. The publication of the work, if subscribers are found in sufficient number (and among these, the Government of the Straits Settlements, the Raja of Sarawak and the Directors of the British North Borneo Company may perhaps be counted upon for substantial support?), will be undertaken by Mr. E. J. Brill of Leyden, whose recently issued prospectus is subjoined:\n\n\"Mr. H. C. Klinkert whose scientific and practical publications on the Malay Language and Literature have already contributed so largely to the knowledge of that language, has, as the result of several years' study, undertaken the compilation of an English-Malay Dictionary, which is to be published next year. When, during the Oriental Congress at Leyden, Mr. Klinkert, speaking with some competent men on this publication, was requested to make it accessible to those also, who do not understand the Dutch Language. Though a very tedious work, he would not directly decline the request, if by a sufficient subscription it should appear that the work would meet the wishes of those who are to use it.\n\nWith regard to the manner in which he intends to compile this dictionary, he believes it to be in consonance with the spir-\n\"it of the language simple and natural, and\u2014what his long experience confirms\u2014thoroughly practical.\n\n\"The transcription of the Malay words will be given in the dialect of the Straits-Settlements, after the manner adopted by Messrs. Maxwell and Keasberry.\n\n\"The English part will be revised by a native Englishman. As soon as we have a sufficient number of subscribers\u2014we shall begin printing. The subscription price for one copy is twenty-five shillings, bound\u2014\n\n\"To show the manner in which the author has formed his plan, and to give an idea of its completeness and extent, we give a specimen, annexed to this prospectus.\n\n\"The whole will be about one thousand\u2014or one thousand two hundred pages.\n\n\"To lay claim to completeness the Dictionary of the English and Malay languages now projected ought to be followed by a Dictionary of the Malay and English languages, the materials for which are in preparation. It will be published as a second volume, if the support accorded to the present volume gives sufficient encouragement.\"\n\n\"Leyden, October, 1884.\n\n\"E. J.

M. Skinner, Vice-President, in the Chair.\n\nThe minutes of the last general meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary read the Annual Report of the Committee for the year 1884. (See p. xiii.)\n\nThe Honorary Treasurer's Accounts for the year 1884 were laid before the meeting. (See p. xvii.)\n\nThe Report and Accounts were unanimously adopted without discussion.\n\nThe election of Officers for the year 1885 were then proceeded\nwith, and the following gentlemen were declared duly elected:\n\nPresident, ... ... ... The Hon'ble A. M. Skinner.\nVice-President, Singapore, ... W. A. Pickering, Esquire, C.M.G.\nVice-President, Penang, ... D. Logan.\nHonorary Secretary, ... The Hon'ble W. E. Maxwell, C.M.G.\nHonorary Treasurer, ... E. Koek, Esquire.\n\nCouncillors, ... ... ...\n\nR. W. Hullett, Esquire.\nA. Knight, Esquire.\nH. L. Noronha, Esquire.\nE. C. Hill, Esquire.\nJ. Miller, Esquire.\n\nThe new members elected provisionally by the Council since the last general meeting were then formally elected by an unanimous vote; and the meeting also elected the following gentlemen who were duly proposed and seconded:\u2014Messrs. C. B. Cerruti, F. H. Gottlieb, G. S. H. Gottlieb.\n\nMr. Knight then proposed that the Officers of the Society be added to by the creation of a Vice-President for Malacca, and that the Hon'ble D. F. A. Hervey be elected to that office.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary explained that the constitution of the Society is fixed by the Rules, and that before altering them, it would be desirable that notice should be given, and the nature of the proposed alteration made known to the members of the Society. This view was generally concurred in by those present. It was suggested in conversation that a sixth Councillor might be appointed, who should be resident in Malacca, but to this course the same objection applied. The Honorary Secretary said that he would be glad to see the meetings of the Society held under a Vice-President in Malacca, for that Settlement had a historical claim, having been the scene of a meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1811, when Raffles and Leyden were there on their way to Java.\n\nMr. Knight said that he would, if necessary, give notice of his proposal at some future date.\n\nThe proceedings then terminated.\nANNUAL REPORT\nOF THE\nCOUNCIL\nOF THE\nSTRAITS BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nFOR THE YEAR 1884.\n\nThe Report which the Council for 1884 have to lay before the Annual General Meeting will, they believe, shew that the interest evinced in the objects for which the Society was established in 1878 continues unabated, and that those objects are being steadily kept in view by those to whom the management of the affairs of the Society is entrusted.\n\nThe new members elected provisionally by the Council since the last General Meeting are:\n\nWalter Egerton.\nE. E. Abrahamson.\nFran\u00e7ois Deloncle.\nStair Elphinstone Dalrymple.\nVan Langen.\nL. Wray, Jr.\nW. H. Diethelm.\nD. Brandt.\nA. T. Dew, P\u00e9rak.\n\nA. W. O'Sullivan.\nDr. D. Manson Fraser, North Borneo.\nSt.V. B. Down.\nE. P. Gueritz, North Borneo.\nW. G. Gulland.\nJ. P. Rodger, Selangor.\nGeorge Copley.\n\nThese elections have now to be confirmed by the members present at the General Meeting.\n\nThe following members have retired:\n\nRevd. J. Aberigh Mackay. | General H. Man.\n\nThe death of the following members has been announced:\n\nH. Herwig. | J. T. Thomson, New Zealand.\nThe following gentlemen have ceased to be members in accordance with Rule 6:\n\nA. Anson.\nR. Bruce.\nB. Douglas.\n\nMohamed bin Mahboot.\nW. Krohn.\nGeorge Mansfield.\n\nIn the Report for 1883, mention is made of a text book of Eastern Geography which the Society had undertaken, at the request of the Government, to produce. The first part of this work (the Malay Peninsula and Borneo) has now been published, and the following letter regarding it has been received from the Government of the Colony:\n\n\"Colonial Secretary's Office,\nSingapore, 12th February, 1885.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary,\n\nStraits Asiatic Society, Singapore.\n\nSir,\u2014I am directed by the Acting Governor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with regard to the publication of the work entitled the \"Eastern Geography,\" and to state that His Excellency fully recognises the valuable assistance which the Society has afforded to the Government in acceding to the request that it should undertake this work, and desires especially to tender the cordial thanks of the Government to the Vice-President (Mr. A. M. Skinner) for the valuable results of the action of the Society.\n\n2. The work which he has edited\u2014the first of its kind as regards this part of the world\u2014will, in His Excellency's opinion, prove of very great usefulness both inside the Schools of this Colony, and outside the Colony itself, where so much ignorance prevails regarding the Malay Peninsula and its neighbourhood.\n\n3. I am to add that His Excellency concurs in the recommendation of the Council of the Society, and will invite the Legislative Council to vote the necessary sum to enable Mr. Stanford's offer to be accepted. It appears to His Excellency that if the part regarding Australia is to be omitted, as His Excellency considers it should be, it may not even be necessary to pay so much as \u00a3100.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA. P. Talbot,\nfor Acting Colonial Secretary, S. S.\"\nThe scheme for republishing a selection of papers which have appeared from time to time in the Journals or Proceedings of learned Societies bearing upon matters of scientific interest in the Eastern Archipelago, has taken definite shape.\n\nThe consent of the Asiatic Society of Bengal having been received to the republication of papers relating to Indo-China which have appeared in their Journals, the first series of selections will consist of papers extracted from \"Asiatic Researches\" and the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. These will probably be preceded by a few papers originally published in Dalrymple's \"Oriental Repertory.\" The Council have been fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of Dr. Reinhold Rost, Librarian of the India Office, who has consented to edit the re-printed papers in London. It is hoped that two volumes will be brought out during 1885, and it will then rest with the Society whether or not to extend the scheme and continue to issue, from time to time, as funds may allow, further volumes of selected papers relating to the Far East.\n\nThe previous ventures of the Society in the direction of publishing, have not caused, in the aggregate, any pecuniary loss. The large Map of the Peninsula (1879) has, up to date, left a margin of profit of $33.63, with 8 copies still in hand.\n\nThe re-publication of the \"Hikayat Abdullah\" cost $400, of which $368 has been recovered, and 2 copies remain.\n\nIn the Department of Geography, the Council have noted with satisfaction the publication during the year 1884, by the Government of the Native State of Selangor, of a map of the State (published by Mr. E. Stanford, Charing Cross) on the scale of 2 miles to the inch.\n\nThe Skeleton Map of the Peninsula, upon which all new information is to be entered as exploration advances, mentioned in last year's Report, has been completed, and several maps and sketches embodying fresh geographical knowledge have been received from the Native States.\n\nThe most important of these is the Map of Ulu Pahang by Mr. W. Cameron, a most indefatigable explorer as well as a skilful surveyor and geologist.\n\nFour of the papers published in the Society's Journal since the last General Meeting are by Members who had not previously contributed, and the Council hope that they may infer from this that the number of active Members is increasing. They desire, however, to renew the appeal made in last year's Report, for\nliterary contributions on scientific subjects from those willing to cooperate in the objects of the Society.\n\nIt is believed that some will perhaps contribute notes, who have not leisure to write papers, and, in order to encourage this, it is proposed to develop the idea with which a few pages have usually been set apart in each number of the Journal for \"Miscellaneous Notes,\" and to publish in each future number a paper devoted to \"Notes and Queries,\" which will be edited by the Honorary Secretary.\n\nNo. 12 of the Journal of this Society (for the half-year ending December, 1883) did not appear until May, 1884, and No. 13 (for the half-year ending June, 1884) was only published in December last.\n\nThe absence of the Honorary Secretary from the Colony in the spring and autumn of the year partly accounts for this. No. 14 (for the last half-year of 1884) is now in the press.\n\nThe following papers have been published in the Journal of the Society since the last General Meeting:\n\n\"Malayan Ornithology\" (Part III), by Capt. Kelham, Highland Light Infantry.\n\n\"Gutta-producing Trees,\" by L. Wray, Jr.\n\n\"Shamanism in Perak,\" by W. E. Maxwell.\n\n\"Changes in Malayan Dialects,\" by A. M. Ferguson, Jr.\n\n\"Straits Meteorology,\" by A. M. Skinner.\n\n\"The Pigmies,\" translated by J. Errington de la Croix.\n\n\"Valentyn's Description of Malacca,\" translated by J. M\u00fcller, edited by D. F. A. Hervey.\n\n\"The Law and Customs of the Malays with reference to the Tenure of Land,\" by W. E. Maxwell.\n\n\"The Stream Tin Deposits of Perak,\" by Revd. J. E. Tenison-Woods.\n\n\"Rembau,\" by D. F. A. Hervey.\n\n\"The Tawaran and Putatan Rivers,\" by S. E.

BUBU.\n\nGunong Bubu is the most elevated mountain of the coast range of the State of P\u00earak. Its highest summit lies about S. 17\u00b0 E. of Thaipeng, distant, say, twenty miles as the crow flies. It is one of the series of nearly detached groups of mountains which form the coast-range, having their spurs and longest axes generally in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction. There is no record of any exploration of Gunong Bubu. It is said that some Europeans have ascended it and made a collection of plants, but what the Reverend Mr. Scortechini and I saw of the flora, inclines us to think that some of the adjacent and lower summits could only have been reached. The mountain is not quite 5,600 feet high, but rendered very inaccessible by precipices of granite 1,000 feet high, which bar most of the spurs. At the request of Sir Hugh Low, I undertook its exploration, accompanied by the Revd. B. Scortechini as botanist, and Mr. C. F. Bozzolo, who had charge of the Malays carrying our baggage. We started from the mountain garden at Arang Para, which is about 3,000 feet above sea level\u2014not a good point of departure, as we had to descend and then climb up again over several very steep spurs before we could reach even the foot of the range. The following is the journal.\n\nMay 20, 1884.\u2014Started from the mountain garden at 9 A.M. on a course due south, descending a very steep slope along a mountain track used by Chinese sawyers. It soon began to rain heavily, which made the steep path so slippery that\nprogress was exceedingly slow. We at last reached the bottom of a narrow gorge, through which a mountain torrent came down with considerable force. From this point to the summit of Gunong Bubu, our road had to be cut through the jungle. After wading along the stream to find a convenient point for climbing the next spur or ridge, we crossed it, having difficult and slow climbing both in ascending and descending. The forest was a close jungle of rattans and saplings, with an undergrowth of ferns which completely closed us in above and around. A second spur, still higher than the first, was ascended, but on its ridge we found the jungle in a slight degree more open, so we continued along it. It ascended slowly. In about two miles, finding that it was taking us too much out of our course, we left the ridge and crossed another spur which was very steep, rendering it necessary to proceed by a series of long zigzags. Rested in the furthest valley, and then mounted another ridge higher and steeper than any we had previously climbed. On the edge, we found an old rhinoceros beat, which we followed, ascending for about a mile, where it terminated on the summit of an almost precipitous bluff. The rain was so heavy at this point, that we had to wait till it ceased before we could descend. This was no easy matter, and occupied until nearly sunset in bringing down our baggage. In the valley, we found a branch of the Kenas River making a pretty cascade over large granite boulders. Here we built nice little sheds which the large-leaved Pinanga palm enabled us to thatch comfortably.\n\nMay 21.\u2014We left our encampment about 7.30, following the stream until it joined the Kenas River. Near this we found a species of Helicia, which is the second proteaceous plant we have noticed in Perak. We also found a splendid species of Fagraea, probably F. auriculata, with large fragrant\ncream-coloured flowers nearly a foot across the rotate corolla, the tube of which is eight inches long.\n\nThe Kenas River is about one hundred feet wide, descending in rapids amid large granite boulders. It contains many deep water-holes with fishes, different somewhat from those on the Perak. They are under examination, with a view to specific description. There are also land crabs about the stream and a peculiar species of prawn (*Palaeomou*?).\n\nFrom the Kenas, we struck to the west of south crossing two small, steep, densely-wooded spurs. This brought us to the base of a steep slope, which was at the foot of Gunong Bubu. Here the jungle became more open, being mostly composed of forest trees and Bertam palm (*Engeissonia trisis*). We soon lost sight of the Pinanga which we had found on the Kenas. There was a distinct rhinoceros beat on the crest, covered with foot-prints, which had been made only a few hours before. The logs which lay in the way were smoothed by the constant passing and repassing of these animals. There were also many of these water-holes and it was difficult to imagine that they had not been cut artificially on one side. The jungle was easily cut, but the track was so steep as scarcely to afford a footing in places. It took us nearly the whole day to climb a distance of 5,000 yards, and then we camped on a narrow terrace near a small trickling supply of water. Near this camp, we could hear the roaring of a large cascade, probably not far off, but the descent to it was too steep for us to attempt to reach it then. Our huts were built of attap and were large and comfortable. We had descended so much from our starting point that we were still below the level of the Hermitage garden of Arang Para.\n\nMay 22.\u2014Before starting this morning we sent back a party of Malays to bring up fresh supplies to this camp for our\nreturn journey. We got away about 8 A.M. It is very difficult to make an early move from these camps. What with cooking rice for the day and packing up the baggage, a good part of the morning runs away. Our journey was just like that of yesterday, only a little more steep in places. About 1,000 feet above camp we left the region of Bertam, or attap palms, and came into that of *Licuala*, growing amid high forest trees. Up to this time, we could not get a single view of the country around us. When we had ascended to the level of Arang Para we felled a number of trees in the hope of extending the prospect, but were unsuccessful. The ascent was now only very steep in places, and the spur curved much more to the north. When we reached the height of nearly 4,000 feet above the sea, we camped and built our houses. When this was done, we felled a good deal of timber on the northern slope of the spur and soon opened up an extensive view. Arang Para bungalow bore about E.N.E., but none of the Larut side of the range was visible, owing to the spurs of Mount Bubu. We had an abundance of water close to our camp. A small stream fell over about one hundred feet of rocks at a short distance below the terrace we were upon.\n\nNext day, the 23rd, we left all the baggage at our resting place, and proceeded to make a trial trip to reach the summit. We could get no reliable information from the Malays. Some said it was only two hours' journey, while others insisted that it would take the whole day. Our intention was to climb for half a day, and, if the difficulties were great, to move our camp on another stage. Our great delay, of course, was in cutting down the jungle and not being able to see more than a few yards around us. However, we were agreeably surprised to find a comparatively easy, though steep, ascent for\nabout a mile. After this, we had to climb by roots of trees, stumps and branches, and made but slow progress. I cannot say now whether this portion of our journey was on the face of a cliff or not. We could see absolutely nothing around us but trees and roots, and these overhung with such a thick coating of brown moss, ferns and orchids, that above and below were equally hidden. Sometimes we crept in and out under these roots and over them, or climbed a tree to get to some ledge near its upper branches, but where we were going, or how far we were, could only be guessed from the barometer. I do not suppose, however, that any one could climb so steep an ascent with less danger. One could not fall. It would puzzle any person to throw a stone more than a few yards amid such a thicket.\n\nAt five thousand feet by the aneroid, we began to see the first specimens of that graceful fern Matonia pectinata. This has never been previously recorded from Perak, and the only habitats are Java and Mount Ophir near Malacca, where it is associated with Dipteris Horsfeldii. The latter fern we had seen 1,000 feet below, and it occurs on all the mountains of Perak at heights a little over 3,500 feet but at Singapore it is found at the sea level. Besides this, there was plenty to see and admire in the way of ferns, orchids and mosses, with many curious fungi and lichens, for the moisture and deep shade made the place the very home of the cryptogamia. But the climbing was such very hard work, that attention to anything else was almost impossible. At about 5,400 feet, the entire vegetation changed. It was still a thicket, but more or less stunted and twiggy, very distressing to climb. I cannot say how long it continued, but long before I expected it, we suddenly found ourselves on an open level space, on the summit of Mount Bubu.\nThis, however, is not the highest point. The crest of the mountain is a narrow ridge about half a mile long, gradually sloping up to the northward until it is about 100 feet above where we then were. This might be called the lower shoulder of the ridge or crest. A splendid view was obtainable three-quarters round the compass, but the north was hidden by the higher summit.\n\nThe first thing that attracted our attention was the vegetation. The trees were all low and small, stunted and gnarled by the weather. Beneath there was a thick carpet of moss, into which the foot sunk some inches and when withdrawn left a pool of water on the foot-print. Above this was a most luxuriant growth of heather (*Lycopodium nutans*), while *Matonia pectimata* spread out its fan-like fronds on every side. The sides of the trees were hoary with long-bearded lichens (*Usnea borbata*) and mosses. There were only a few species of trees. One very common one was a conifer, but in the absence of any cones we were left in doubt whether it was *Dacrydium elatum* or some other species. Abundance of young plants of this pine covered the ground. There were also thickets of *Leptospermum flarescens*, which grew as high as the pine, and a shrub of the genus *Leucopogon*. The two latter are entirely Australian on their affinities, and both species are found on that continent. Besides these, there were abundance of Nepenthes or pitcher-plants with bushes of Rhododendrons (*R. verticillatum*?), with a *Gahnia* and some few other flowering plants and ferns.\n\nFrom this point, a hasty exploration was made to the highest point or northern summit of the mountain. Though scarcely half a mile in direct distance, it required considerably over a mile of hard climbing to reach it. The roots of the bushes have proved a kind of upper platform on the crest and\nthus one has to climb over and under in a most disgraceful manner, as the whole was an entangled mass of twigs which stopped and caught one at every side, besides being dripping with water. By the time the highest crest was reached, the clouds had gathered, and no view could be obtained. Having satisfied ourselves about the road, and cleared the most of it, we turned back. Though the descent was slower and more troublesome than going up, yet we reached our camp easily an hour before sunset. Our supplies had not arrived, and our chances of making a second ascent seemed rather uncertain. Our last rations of rice were served out that evening. On the next day (Queen's birthday, hence the camp was called Queen's Camp) we cleared away much more of the forest, but as the party were without food, and there were no signs of our messengers, we prepared, with much chagrin, to return to our lower camp. We had just packed everything when the supplies arrived. Our messengers had lost themselves in the jungle and this was the cause of the delay.\n\nOn the 27th, taking with us a light equipment for camping, we again ascended the summit of the mountain. After erecting our tents, or rather our waterproof sheets which served as a substitute, we went on to the summit and built an immense heap of wood and dammar resin to serve as a signal fire at night. Beyond the summit there is a steep valley and at the other side are isolated pinnacle of granite nearly as high as the mountain and perfectly precipitous except on the side of the valley. Messrs. Scortechini and Bozzolo ascended this with much hard climbing and found on the summit a small pile of stones and a flag-staff, while the remains of a flag were strewn on the ground. It is supposed that this flag was placed there at the instance of Captain Speedy, who paid the Malays a considerable sum to plant a flag there for surveying\npurposes. We found no other signs that any person had visited the locality before.\n\nA perfect deluge of rain with thunder and lightning obliged Messrs. Bozzolo and Scortechini to remain on the granite pinnacle for some time, for the cloud and mist obscured everything and rendered it impossible to descend. I remained on the opposite summit superintending the erection of the bonfire. It was miserably cold, and we were all very glad when we could make our way back to our tents. This we did not do until the clouds cleared, when a magnificent view was unveiled. Both sides of the coast range were visible and the plains from the Dinding River to the town of Thaipeng were laid out like a panorama. The Matang opening with the village seemed just beneath us. The whole valley of the P\u00e9rak with all the windings of the river were clear and distinct for a distance of fifty or sixty miles. The main range was also very clear and some of the highest peak bore a different aspect from anything I had seen before. An island between P\u00e9rak and Sumatra, which is rarely seen from Mount Ijau, was now plainly visible, as also several summits of mountains to the south-east. Nothing could be seen of the mountain observed by Mr. Swettenham from Arang Para. The highest summit visible to us was, in my opinion, the sugar-loaf hill to the north and east of Gunong Robinson. I should think the mountain I refer to is between eight thousand and nine thousand feet high.\n\nAltogether, the view from the summit of Gunong Bubu is one of the finest imaginable. Rivers and mountains, dense forests and open plains, the distant sea and the unexplored forests to the eastward all combine to form a scene of wonderfully varied beauty. Unfortunately, however, the clouds and mists almost continually obscure this prospect. At early morning and after a heavy thunderstorm, the whole atmosphere is\ncomparatively clear. At other times, there is generally either a cap of cloud on the summit of the mountain itself or the whole valleys are shrouded with dazzling masses of steam-like white vapour in which the mountain tops peep out like islands.\n\nWe returned to our camp about sunset, and then proceeded to light our signal fires. We had one on each end of the crest so as to be well seen from the valley of the P\u00e9rak on one side and Thaipeng on the other. Owing to the good supply of dammar we had obtained, we were able to kindle a very bright and conspicuous flame at each station and we were answered by fires from Sengang, Kwala Kangsa, and other places on the P\u00e9rak river as well as from Kota and Matang on the L\u00e2rut side. We also fired rockets, but these were not seen except in places very close to the mountain.\n\nOur tents were completely open on one side, but the cold was not great until nearly dawn. The temperature then went down to $58^\\circ$ Fahrenheit, which was the lowest reached on this journey. At 4 A.M. we were visited by heavy rain and a strong wind from the east. Our shelter did not protect us from either, so that we passed the time rather uncomfortably until sunrise, when the rain ceased. Everything was then so wet that we could not attempt to dry our clothes, we therefore returned to Queen's Camp as speedily as we could. Having taken a hasty and scanty meal there, we made our way to our second day's camp reaching it easily at sunset. We expected to meet supplies at this camp, but they had not arrived. We had nothing but cocoa to serve out to our weary and hungry Malays after their long journey, but with this they were satisfied and went to rest quite cheerfully. An early start on the following morning enabled us to reach the Kenas River at an appointed depot, and here we found the much-needed supplies at about noon.\nI have already mentioned that, at the camp of the preceding evening, we could again distinctly hear the roar of some large cascade at about half a mile from where we were. We tried to search it, but the jungle was too thick and the descent too steep to do so that night, our want of provisions obliged us to push on without further delay in the evening. From the noise we heard, there must be a fine body of water, falling from a considerable height.\n\nThe camp we were now upon was not one we had occupied on our outward journey. It was on the River Kenas. The stream was here about eighty yards wide and descending in rapids amid large rocks. There were many deep pools of beautifully clear water. We spent a few days fishing on these pools, and caught a good many rock-fish and mullet about one pound in weight. Three species of fish were seen and a peculiar prawn. I believe the fish were species of *Barbus therapon*, and what I thought was *Polyacanthus cuponus*. The latter is the scaly fish (without barbels) which is found in the ditches and paddy fields.\n\nIn returning from the camp, we crossed the watershed between the Kenas and Kangsa, in order to explore the course of that river, which was not previously known. The watershed was somewhat difficult of access, and took us to a height of about three thousand feet above the sea-level. We had the misfortune to meet with bad weather and incessant rain during this part of the journey. The river Kangsa, even in its upper portions, was swollen into a fierce muddy stream, quite impassable, except on fallen trees. Of these there were many lying from bank to bank on the rocky sides of the torrent. We soon found that the water descended in a series of cascades for a depth of about 1,100 feet. I can give no idea of the grand magnificence of the scenery at this part of our jour-\nney. Whether there was a flood in the river or not, the beauty of the rocks and precipices in the wild forest could not be surpassed. We had to descend by a series of zigzags crossing the successive cascades on logs sometimes at a considerable height above the water. If ever the romance of a lovely view was destroyed by the perils of a journey, it was here. We had to cross fifteen of these aerial bridges. Some were narrow and some were half rotten, and all were over cascades where the slightest slip was certain destruction. In the lower part of the stream we had to ford the water, which was just fordable and no more. I consider that it was quite wonderful that this part of our journey was accomplished without accident, which, however, was only effected by constant care and much delay. We arrived at Lady Weld's rest-house on the Kuala Kangsa Road on the evening of the last day of the month the most of which had been spent in the jungle, and none the worse for our sojourn away from civilization, except in the innumerable leech-bites from which we all suffered.\n\nJ. E. TENISON-WOODS.\n\nNote.\u2014Amongst the fishes of the Kenas there was a small specimen of what I took to be *Ophiocephalus micropeltes*, but the species is doubtful. The barbel may have been *B. kolus*.\n\nSince our journey, the mountain has been again ascended by Mr. Cantley, the Government Botanist, who obtained a good collection of plants.\nIn a former number of the Straits Asiatic Journal (No. 10), some account was given of the religious ideas and customs of the Sea Dyaks of Sarawak; of their belief in gods and evil spirits; of their sacrifices and auguries. The subject is incomplete without a consideration of their burial rites, and their ideas of eschatology. These I now endeavour to supply.\n\nBut first a word about marriage. Birth is not celebrated with any religious ceremony, and marriage is a comparatively simple matter. The marriage ceremony consists principally in publicly fetching the bride from her father's to the bridegroom's house, but the Dyak, with his love of divination, could not allow such an occasion to pass without some attempt, or pretence, to penetrate the secrets of the future. When the bridal party are assembled in the bride's house, and the arrangements for the young couple talked over, a pinang (betel-nut) is split into seven pieces by some one supposed to be lucky in matrimonial affairs; and these pieces, together with the other ingredients of the betel-nut mixture, are put in a little basket, which is bound round with red cloth and laid for a short time upon the open platform outside the verandah of the house: should the pieces of pinang by some mystic power increase in number, the marriage will be an unusually lucky one; but should they decrease, it is a bad omen, and the marriage must be postponed, or relinquished altogether; but, as matter of experience, they neither increase nor decrease; and this is interpreted in the obvious sense of an ordinary marriage upon which the spirits have pronounced neither good nor bad. This action gives the name to the whole ceremony, which is called Mlah* pinang\u2014splitting the betel-nut. When the bride has\n\n* Belah, Malay.\u2014Ed.\nbeen brought to her future husband's house, a fowl is waved* over them, with a hastily muttered invocation for health and prosperity; and with this semi-sacrificial action the marriage is complete.\n\nDeath is much more involved with sacred observances. Although the Dyaks have something of the Moslem sentiment of fate, and commonly speak of the measure of a man's life, which once reached nothing can prolong, yet this does not seem to help them to a quiet submission to the inevitable; for, even when death is unmistakeably drawing near, they are eager in fruitless efforts of resistance, and the scene is generally one of tumultuous wailing. They will shout wildly to the medicine-man to recover the wandering spirit, and they will call out to the dying\u2014\"Come back; do not go with the spirits who are leading you astray to Hades. This is your country, \"and we are your friends.\" The word pulai,pulai, \"return, return,\" is reiterated in piercing, piteous tones. Silence and reverent awe in the presence of death would be regarded as culpable callousness to the interests of a life trembling in the balance. And when actual dissolution is plainly imminent, they dress the person in the garments usually worn, and some few ornaments in addition, that the man may be fully equipped for the untried journey; and in violent demonstrations of grief, the women and younger people wait the end, or perhaps rush distractedly about in hopes of doing something to delay it. As soon as respiration has ceased, a wild outburst of wailing is heard from the women, which proclaims to all the village that life is extinct. The cessation of visible breathing is with the Dyak the cessation of life; he knows of no other way to distinguish a prolonged state of coma from death, and I have good reason to believe that sometimes bodies have been buried before they were corpses.\n\nAfter death the body is lifted from the room to the ruai, or verandah, of the village-house; some rice is sprinkled upon the breast, and it is watched until burial by numerous relatives and friends who come to show their sympathy. The nearer connections of the deceased will probably be heard\n\n* This waving of a sacrifice or offering is a noticeable feature in the practice of Hindu exorcists in India.\u2014ED.\nshouting out to some departed relative to come from Hades and take them away also, feeling at the moment that life is unbearable. At a burial once I saw a woman jump down into the grave, and stretch herself at full length upon the coffin loudly begging to be buried with her husband.\n\nAmong some tribes, there are professional wailers, nearly always women, who are hired to wail for the dead. One of these is now fetched, not only to lament the lost, but by her presence and incantation to assist the soul in its passage to Hades. Her song takes about twelve hours to sing, and the sum of it is this. She calls with tedious prolixity upon bird, beast and fish to go to Hades with a message, but in vain, for they cannot pass the boundary. She then summons the spirit of the winds to go, and\u2014\n\n\"Call the dead of ancient times,\n\"To fetch the laid out corpse under the crescent moon,\n\"Already arranged like the galaxy of the milky way.\n\n\"To call those along ago bent double,\n\"To fetch the shroud of our friend below the moon,\n\"Already a heap like the hummock of the rengguang. (1)\n\n\"To call the far away departed,\n\"To fetch the nailed coffin under the dawn of the rising sun,\n\"Already like the form of a skilled artisan's chest.\n\n\"To call the long departed ones,\n\"To fetch the resak-wood coffin below the brilliant moon,\n\"Already bound with golden bands.\"\n\nThe Spirit of the Winds is reluctant at first; but, at the solicitation of his wife, at length consents to do the wailer's bidding. He speeds on his way through forests and plains, hills and valleys, rivers and ravines, until night comes on and he is tired and hungry, and stops to make a temporary resting place. After refreshing himself, he goes up a high tree to make sure of the proper road. \"He looks round, and all is dark and dim in the distance: he looks behind, and all is obscure and con-\n\n(1) A crustacean which burrows in the earth.\n\u201cfused: he looks before him, and all is gloomy as night.\u201d On all sides are roads, for the ways of the dead are seventy times seven. In his perplexity, he drops his human spirit form, and by a stroke of ghostly energy metamorphoses himself into rushing wind; and soon makes known his presence in Hades by a furious tempest which sweeps everything before it, and rouses the inhabitants to enquire the cause of the unwonted commotion. They are told. They must go to the land of the living and fetch so and so and all his belongings. The dead rejoice at the summons, and without delay collect their friends, get into a boat and pull through the stygian waters; and with such force does the boat plough the lake, that all the neighbouring fish die. Arrived at the landing place, they all make an eager rush into the house, \u201clike soldiers who fly upon the spoil; and mad like wild pigs they seize the dead one.\u201d The departed soul cries out in anguish at being thus violently carried off; but long before the ghostly party has reached their abode, it becomes reconciled to its fate.\n\nThus sings the wailer, who has now done her work. She has conveyed the soul to its new home, which it would never reach, it is said, without her intervention; but remain suspended somewhere, and find rest nowhere.\n\nThe climate necessitates a speedy interment; but there is another reason for putting their dead quickly out of sight. After life is extinct, the body is no longer spoken of as a body or corpse; it is an antu, a spirit; and to have it long with them would, apart from sanitary considerations, expose them to sinister ghostly influences. Some time before daylight, a sufficient number of men take away the corpse wrapped in mats and secured with a light framework of wood; and as it is being borne from the house, ashes are thrown after it, and a water-gourd is flung and broken on the floor. The graveyard is generally a small hill, or rising ground in the neighbourhood, as unkempt as the surrounding forest, overshadowed by towering trees, and full of an entangled undergrowth of grass, climbers and thorny rotan. On coming to the cemetery, the first thing done is to kill a fowl to propitiate the dread powers of Hades, to whom the ground is supposed to be devoted: and so strong is the need of this sacrifice felt, that no Dyak,\nunenlightened by other principles, will dare touch the ground until it is made. Some now dig the grave; some cook a meal, which is afterwards eaten on the spot; whilst others get a large log of wood of the required length, split it into two, scoop out the inside sufficiently to admit the corpse, and thus make a rude coffin, the two parts of which, after receiving the body, are firmly lashed together with rotan. Sometimes, however, the coffin is made of planks before proceeding to the graveyard.\n\nWith the burial of the body is deposited baiya, that is, things given to the dead. Personal necessaries, like rice, plates, the betel-nut mixture, money and a few other articles are laid with the body in the ground; whilst spears, baskets, swords, weaving materials, pots, jars, gongs, etc., are put on the surface, the jars and gongs being broken to render them useless to any alien who may be inclined to sacrilegious depredations.* This baiya, little or much according to the wealth of the deceased, is regarded as a mark of affection, and to omit it is to fail in a natural duty. But the custom is really founded upon the belief that the things so bestowed are in some mystic way carried into the other world, and useful to the dead\u2014their capital, in fact, to begin life with in the new stage of existence. And in cases where Dyaks are killed, or die by sickness, far away from home, the baiya is still deposited in the family burying-place. A burial without baiya is, in their phrase, the burial of a dog. A fence round the grave as a protection from ravages by wild pigs completes the interment.\n\nThere is a deeply-seated fear amongst Dyaks touching everything connected with death and burial rites. They have for instance, a lurking suspicion that the dead, having become the victims of the most terrible of all powers, may harbour envious feelings, and possibly follow the burying-party back to their homes with some evil intent. To prevent such mischief, some of them will make a notched stick-ladder,\u2020 and fix it upside\n\n* Compare the observances of the Johor Jakuns, No. 7 of this Journal p. 97.\u2014Ed.\n\u2020 The tangga samangat of the Johor Jakuns is said \"to enable the spirit to leave the grave when required.\" Id.\u2014Ed.\ndown in the path near the cemetery to stop any departed spirit who may be starting on questionable wanderings; others plant bits of stick to imitate bamboo caltrops to lame their feet should they venture in pursuit, and so obstruct their advance.\n\nInterment is the usual, but not universal, mode of disposing of the dead. *Manangs*, or medicine men, are suspended in trees in the cemetery;* and amongst the Balau tribe, children dying before dentition has developed enjoy the same distinction, having a jar for their coffin. Some eccentric individuals have a dislike to be put underground, and request that after death they may be laid upon an open platform in the cemetery; the result of which is that a most offensive exudation soon oozes from the badly made coffin; and after a year or two the posts become rotten, and the whole structure tumbles down, the coffin bursting in pieces, adding to the already large stock of exposed bones, which, with broken pots, jars, baskets, and other miscellaneous articles, swell the property of grim death, and make the place a vast charnel awesome and gloomy, well calculated to frighten the superstitious Dyak. Occasionally, a man has a fancy to have his body put on the top of a mountain, and the relatives probably dare not refuse to carry out the wish through fear of imaginary evil consequences. Among the Kayans, this burial above ground is the general practice, but they carry it out in a more substantial manner. The *baiya* is put in the coffin, but heads of slain enemies are hung\n\n---\n\n* Even among the Malays of the Peninsula, this practice of keeping the body of a *pawang*, or medicine-man, above ground is not unknown. It exists also probably among the Sakai tribes. *Blian taun* is the Sakai name for the original tiger-spirit or man-tiger. A man who has a tiger-spirit as his familiar is a *pawang blian*, and may not be buried in the ordinary Malay way, but his body must be placed leaning against a *prah* tree, in order that the spirit may enter into another man.\n\nIn Perak, it is said that in the time of Sultan J'Afar there was a *pawang* of the *hantu blian*, named *Alang Dewasa*. When he died (at Buluh Mipyak in Ulu Perak) his relations would not permit his body to be set up against a tree, but buried it. Soon afterwards the ground was found disturbed, and since then Alang Dewasa has frequently appeared as a *hantu blian*, when invoked by *pawangs* of that class (See Journal No. 12, p 224). He comes down in the shape of a tiger, with one eye closed, the effect of an injury he received when buried, or when leaving the earth to assume his animal form.\u2014ED.\nup round the grave. Great warriors have been sometimes buried for a time and then exhumed, and their relics sacredly kept by their descendants in or near their houses, or it may be, on the spur of a neighbouring hill, with the object of securing the departed ancestor as a tutelary spirit.\n\nSea Dyaks do not consider burial as the last office which they can render to the dead, but follow them up with certain after-ministries of mixed affection and superstition. For three or four evenings after death, they light a fire somewhere outside the house for the use of the departed; for in Hades, they say, fire is not to be procured without paying for it. After burial, the nearest relation lives in strict seclusion and keeps a comparative fast until the observance called pana is made. A plate of rice with other eatables is taken by one of the neighbours to this chief mourner, and from this time he or she returns to the usual diet, and occupations of life. But this neighbourly act to the living is the least part of pana, amongst those tribes, at least where professional wailers exist. It is principally concerned with the dead, to whom by it food is supposed to be sent. Boiled rice and other things usually eaten with it, together with Dyak delicacies, are put together, and thrown through the opening at the back of the house, and the wailer is fetched to effect their transmission to Hades. She comes again to the house of mourning, not to lament over the dead\u2014that is left for the relatives to do\u2014but to call upon the adjutant bird, \"the royal bird which fishes the waters all alone,\" to do her bidding in conveying the articles of the pana to the other world. Among these are included with some pathos the sorrows and sighs of the living.\n\n\"To carry the pana of tears to the departed one\n\"at the clear mouth of the Potatoe river.\n\"To carry deep sighs to those sunk out of view\n\"in the land of the red ripe rambutan\n\"To carry pitying sobs to those who have fallen\n\"unripe in the land of empty fruiting limes.\"\n\nThe bird, says the song, speeds on its way, and after taking a rest on the bacha tree, which bears for flower one dark red bead, arrives in the region of the departed. There\nthey do not recognize the visitant, and inquire where it comes from and why: \"Do you come to look at the widows? We have thirty and one; but only one is handsome. Do you come to seek after maidens? We have thirty and three; but only one is pretty.\" \"No,\" says the bird, \"we have widows and maidens plenty in the land of the living, all beautiful and admired of men.\" \"What is that you have brought with you so securely covered up?\" \"Get a basin, and I will pour the contents of my burden into it.\" The basin is brought and receives the pana, and lo! the eatables and the tears and the sobs of the living mourners have become gold and silver and precious stones wondrously beautiful. But neither the men or the women know what they are; and mutual accusations of ignorance and stupidity are bandied about, and a noisy quarrel is the result. At this juncture, an ancient native of Hades appears, one, that is, who never was an inhabitant of this world;\n\nDara Rabai Gruda*\nDayang Sepang Kapaiya.\n\nShe chides their unseemly squabbling, and explains to them that the bird has come from the realms of the living with presents from their friends; whereupon they are seized with a passionate desire to return, but are told that this is impossible.\n\n\"The notched ladder is top downwards.\nTheir eyes see crookedly.\nTheir feet step the wrong way.\nTheir speech is all upside down.\"\n\nTheir capacities are no longer adapted to the world they have left, and their destiny is irreversible; but still they urge their request to accompany the bird, and all the ingenuity of Hades is called in requisition to devise means of amusing the souls as yet unaccustomed to their new dwelling. Meanwhile, the bird takes its homeward flight. Thus far the wailer.\n\nUntil this pana is made, say the Dyaks who observe it, the soul is not thoroughly conscious that it has departed from the world, and Hades will not give it food or water; but after this, it is received as a regular denizen of deathland.\n\n* Garuda, the eagle of Vishnu? See No. 7 of this Journal, p. 13.\u2014Ed.\nThere is a similar observance called *sumping*, which is carried out at a varying period after death. They take the symbols and trophies of a head-hunting raid, and the wailer is supposed to procure the services of the spirit of the winds to convey them to the dead, whose abode, before full of darkness and discomfort, is now, at sight of the trophies, filled with light; for they have the satisfaction of feeling that their relations have revenged upon others their own death; so henceforth they stand more freely upon their own footing.\n\nThis observance, which, according to ancient custom, could not be performed until the head of an enemy had been obtained, brings out the darker and fiercer side of the Dyak nature. They would fight with death if they could; but as they cannot, they rejoice in taking vengeance upon the living, whenever a chance of killing the enemies of their tribe offers itself; so as to be able to say to themselves: \"My relatives have revenged my death. I am now on equal terms with the evil fate which has sent me hither.\" But in these times, when they live under a strong and civilized government, it is very seldom that this observance can be carried out in its fulness; and therefore it is either slurred over by some mild substitute, or omitted altogether.\n\nBut the great observance for the dead is the *Gauwi antu*, Festival of Departed Spirits. No definite period is fixed for the celebration of it, and the time varies from one to three or four years. The preparation for it of food and drink and other things is carried on for weeks and even months; and sometimes it taxes very severely the resources of the Dyak. When all is ready, the whole neighbourhood for miles round is invited to partake of it. It is an opportunity for a general social gathering; it is a formal laying aside of mourning; above all, it is, in their minds, the execution of certain offices necessary for the final well-being of the dead.\n\nBut though it is a feast for the dead to which they are invoked and invited, yet they pretend to guard against any unorthodox and premature approach of the departed as full of uncanny influence. When the *tuak*, a drink brewed from rice, has been made, an earthenware potful of it is hung up before the door of the one room which each family of the\nvillage house occupies, so as to attract the attention of any casual wanderer from Hades. Such a one is supposed to see the pot, and to go and regale himself from it, and be satisfied without going further; and thus his thoughts are pleasantly diverted from the inner seat of family life; the room\u2014where, if permitted to enter, he might possibly, in revengeful spite, carry off some of the living circle.\n\nThe presence of the dead is desired, but only at the proper time and in the proper way. But how are they to come from Hades in the numbers desired? Nothing easier, thinks the Dyak, send a boat for them: So he despatches what is called the lumpang. A piece of bamboo in which some rice has been boiled is made into a tiny boat, which, by the aid of the wailer, who is again fetched, is sent to Hades. Actually, it is thrown away behind the house; spiritually, it is supposed by the incantation of the wailer to be transmitted to the unseen realm through the instrumentality of the king of all the fishes, who accomplishes the journey without much trouble. But in Hades he dare not ascend the great river of the dead beyond the first landing place, where he leaves the mystic craft together with food and drink. No sooner is this done than the stream becomes dammed up and overflows its banks. The curious boat is seen floating upon the swollen waters, but no one knows what it is. At length a water nymph rises out of the river, and tells them that the strange craft, which by this time has grown from the size of a toy to a mighty war-boat, has been sent by their living friends for their passage across the styx to partake of a final banquet. Great is the joy of Hades on discovering this.\n\n\"Their shouts reach beyond the clouds.\n\"They incite each other like men preparing the drums.\n\"With joy they thump their breasts.\n\"With gladness they slap their thighs.\n\"We shall soon feast below the star-sprinkled heavens.\n\"We shall soon eat where the roaring thunder falls.\n\"We shall soon feed below the suspended moon.\n\"We shall soon be on our way to visit the world, and march\n\"to the feast.\"\n\nWith this contrivance, the way is now open for the\ndeparted to visit their old habitations as soon as the feast shall be ready and the final summons sent. Meanwhile preparations for the festival advance. Those tribes who erect ironwood memorial monuments at the graves get them put together. On the day of the feast, or may be the day before, the women weave with finely split bamboo small imitations of various articles of personal and domestic use, which are afterwards hung over the grave, that is, given to the dead. If it be a male for whom the feast is made, a bamboo gun, a shield, a war cap, a sirih bag and drinking vessel, etc. are woven: if a female, a loom, a fish basket, a winnowing fan, sunshade, and other things: if a child, bamboo toys of various descriptions.\n\nThe guests arrive during the day, and the feasting begins in the evening, and lasts all night. An offering of food to the dead is put outside at the entrance of the house. The wailer of course is present, and her office now is to invoke the spirit of the winds to invite the dead to come, and feast once more with the living; and she goes on to describe in song the whole imaginary circumstances\u2014the coming of the dead from Hades, the feasting, and the return. She sings how numerous animals, one after another, and then Salampandai, maker of men, are called upon to go to Hades, but none have the capacity to undertake such a journey; how the spirit of the winds arrives in Hades, and urges the acceptance of the invitation by expatiating on the abundance and excellence of the food their relations have provided for them; how they and a great company of friends start, and make the journey hither in the boat before sent for them; how glad they are to see our earth and sky again, and to hear the many voices of the busy world; how they eat and drink, dance, and have a cock-fight with their living friends (for they have brought fighting cocks with them); how Hades is beaten (to make it victorious would be a bad omen); how they ask for their final share of the family property, and a division is made, but here again the dead get the worst of it, for in dividing the paddy, the living get the grain, the dead only the chest in which it is kept; so, the jars remain with the living, the stand only on which they are set being given to the dead; the weapons too are retained, whilst the sheaths go to Hades, etc., etc. In the very act of\nprofessing to entertain their friends, they must cheat them for fear of conceding too much to Hades, and so hasten their own departure thither. After this pretended division of property, the children of deathland make their parting salutation with much affection and regret and go on their way. Such is the esoteric meaning of the festival according to the wailer's song.\n\nThe song makes the dead arrive about early dawn; and then occurs an action wherein the intercommunion of the dead and the living is supposed to be brought to a climax. A certain quantity of tuak has been reserved until now in a bamboo, as the peculiar portion of Hades, set apart for a sacred symposium between the dead and the living. It is now drunk by some old man renowned for bravery or riches, or other aged guest who is believed to possess a nature tough enough to encounter the risk of so near a contact with the shades of death. This \"drinking the bamboo,\" as it is called, is an important part of the festival.\n\nEarlier in the night comes the formal putting off of mourning. The nearest male relation is habited in an old waistcloth, or trousers: these are slit through and taken away, and the man assumes a better and finer garment; a bit of hair from each side of the head is cut off and thrown away. In case of female relations, some of the rotan rings which they wear round their waists are cut through and set aside; and they now resume the use of personal ornaments. This action is represented as a last farewell to the dead.\n\nThe morning after the feast, the last duty to the dead is fulfilled. The monument, if any, the bamboo imitation articles, the cast off garments, with food of all kinds are taken and arranged upon the grave. With this final equipment, the dead are said to relinquish all claims upon the living, and to go henceforward on their way, and to depend upon their own resources. But before the Garei antu is made they are thought to carry on a system of secret depredations upon the eatables and drinkables of the living, in other words, to come for their share. When sitting down to his plate of rice, a Dyak will sometimes be seen to throw a little under the house as a portion for a departed one. And I have been told that in the morning the footprints of the dead are sometimes visible in\nthe paddy stores from which they have been supplying themselves under cover of darkness. They are driven to such little foraging expeditions, it is said, by the necessities of their position; for the powers of Hades look with contempt upon any who go thither insufficiently provisioned, and even quarrel with them. And worse still is said to happen if this feast be omitted altogether: the dead lose their personality, and are dissolved into primitive earth. Hence charity to the dead and motives of economy urge the Dyak to undertake the labour and expense of the Gaweit antu, the preparation of which seriously hinders the farmwork, and diminishes the following year's crop of paddy.\n\nAccording to ancient custom, this Feast of the Spirits could not be held until a new human head had been procured, but this ghastly, yet valued, ornament to the festival has now to be generally dispensed with.\n\nThus far I have, in the main, followed Dyak thought about death and the afterstate as it is embodied in their tribal ceremonies and songs; but as might be expected popular thought is not without its ideas and theories; and these supplement what has hitherto been said.\n\nIn the borderland, says the Dyak, between this world and the next, is situated the house of the Bird bubut, a bird here, a spirit there, covering his identity in human form. Every human spirit in the extremity of sickness comes to this place: if it goes up into the house, by the influence of the bird it returns to the body, which thereafter recovers; but if it avoids the house, as is more probable, because it is always in a filthy state of dirt and stench, then it is well on its way to the other world. There is, however, another chance for it at the \"Bridge of Fear,\" a see-saw bridge stretching across the Styx, and difficult to pass over: if the soul makes the passage successfully, it is gone past recovery; if it falls into the water, the cold bath wakes it up to a sense of its real position, and determines it to retrace its steps.\n\nAfter this, it seems, the soul has to pass the \"Hill of Fire.\" Evil souls are compelled to go straight over the hill with scorching fire on every side, which nearly consumes them; but good ones are led by an easy path round the foot, and so\nescape the pain and danger.* This is the only connection in which I have met with anything which suggests the idea of future retribution for wrong doing in this life.\n\nDyaks attribute to the dead a disposition of mixed good and evil towards the living, and so alternately fear and desire any imaginary contact with them. As has been said before, they do not speak of taking a \"corpse\" to the grave, but an antu, a spirit; as though the departed had already become a member of that class of capricious unseen beings which are believed to be inimical to men. They think the dead can rush from their secret habitations, and seize invisibly upon any one passing by the cemetery, which is, therefore, regarded as an awesome, dreaded place. But yet this fear does not obliterate affectionate regard, and many a grave is kept clean and tidy by the loving care of the living; the fear being united with the hope of good, as they fancy the dead may also have the will and the power to help them. I was once present at the death of an old man, when a woman came into the room, and begged him, insensible though he was, to accept a brass finger ring, shouting out to him as she offered it: \"Here, grandfather, take this ring, and in Hades remember 'I am very poor, and send me some paddy medicine that I may get better harvests.'\" Whether the request was granted, I never heard. Sometimes they seek communion with the dead by sleeping at their graves in hope of getting some benefit from them through dreams, or otherwise. A Dyak acquaintance of mine had made a good memorial covering over the grave of his mother of an unusual pattern, and soon fell ill, in consequence, some said, of this ghostly work. So he slept at her grave feeling sure she would help him in his need, but neither voice nor vision nor medicine came; and he was thoroughly disappointed. He said to me: \"I have made a decent resting place for my mother, and now I am ill and ask her assistance, she pays no attention. I think she is very ungrateful.\"\n\n*According to the creed of the Badagas in Tamul India, the souls are obliged to pass by a column of fire which consumes the sinful, and it is only after perils that they reach the land of the blessed by a bridge of rope.\" PESCHEL, Races of Man, p. 284, quoting BAERLEIN, Nach und aus Indien.\u2014Ed.\nThis belief in reciprocal good offices between the dead and the living comes out again in those cases where the remains of the dead are reverently preserved by the living. On every festival occasion, they are presented offerings of food, etc., in return for which these honoured dead are expected to confer substantial favours upon their living descendants.\n\nTheir notions of the relationship of this world to the next, and of the dead to the living, will be further illustrated by the story of Kadawa; which may also be taken as a specimen of their folklore.\n\nKadawa was a great cock-fighter, but had suffered successive defeats from his fellow Dyaks. Irritated at being beaten in a sport he so dearly loved, he started off to seek a cock of a particular white and red plumage, called biring grunggang, which he believed would bear down all others before it. But a chanticleer of this peculiar plumage was a \"rara avis\" among fowls; and village after village was visited, and neither for love or money could the coveted bird be got, for the simple reason that there were none. Nothing daunted, he started off again to go further afield, and determined not to return till he had succeeded in his quest. He travelled hither and thither in the land of the Dyaks until he knew not where he was, and at length arrived at the land of Mandai idup, the borderland between Hades and this world, the inhabitants of which can visit one or the other as they wish. Here a long village house appeared in sight. He went up the ladder into it; and to his astonishment it showed all the signs of being inhabited, even to the fires burning on the hearth and the sounds of surrounding voices; but not a person could be seen; so he shouted out: \"Ho, where are you all?\" Whereupon an unembodied voice answered: \"Is that you, Kadawa? Sit down and eat pinang and sirih. What do you want?\" \"I am come to beg or buy a biring grunggang, fighting cock.\" There is not one to be had here; but if you go on to the next village, you will find one.\" So Kadawa trudged on, greatly wondering at the strangeness of a place peopled by bodiless beings, talking working phantoms of men and women. Soon after, he came to a populous place, where many village-houses were clustered together\u2014Mandai mati,\nthe first district of the land of the dead; but Kadawa knew it not for it had nothing to remind him of death; the people moved about, spoke and had the same form and feature as his own neighbours: moreover they recognized and called him by name. They offered to give him a biring grunggang, which he gladly accepted. Having now obtained his object, he was happy, and finding the people sociable and hospitable, he was in no hurry to return, but remained with his new-found friends more than a year, oblivious of home and its duties.\n\nBut what of his wife and child whom he had left behind in his house? She was grieved at his long absence, and at last resolved that he must be dead and she wept and bewailed him; and at length she died of sorrow.\n\nThe time came when the relations made the Gaweianantu for her; and the wailer was bringing the company of guests from Hades to the feast. Just at that time Kadawa had determined upon returning, and was securing his fighting cock and buckling on his sword, when some one called to him to go on the platform in front of the house, and pointed out to him a procession marching along the hill opposite the house. Kadawa looked and saw in the middle of the long train his own wife; and it flashed upon him that his wife was dead and he himself within the confines of deathland. Without speaking a word he caught up his fighting cock, sword and spear and rushed to join his wife. She repelled him, but in vain. At length they came to the stygian lake and found a boat lying on the shore, into which they all hurried, trying to keep Kadawa out; but he vigorously persisted, and was allowed to embark. After paddling several hours the boat struck upon a rock, and would not move: all except Kadawa jumped out to pull her off, but she would not budge an inch. Kadawa was called upon by his wife to help; but he refused for fear of being left behind\u2014says his wife: \"Do you not know I am 'dead? What is the use of trying to follow me?\" \"Let me die also, I will not leave you.\" \"Very well,\" replied his wife, \"since you are resolved to come with me, when we get to the house, you will find some dried sugar cane over the fire place: eat that, and you will be able to bear me company.\n\"Now get out, and help to pull the boat off the rock.\" He jumped out, and as soon as his feet touched the rock, boat people and lake vanished, and he found himself standing at his own doorstep.\n\nBut no pleasure did his return bring him, for he found his friends making the last farewell feast for his wife. He neither ate nor drank nor shared in the festivities; but kept in his own room till all was over when he thought of the sugar cane over the fireplace. He searched for it, but found nothing more than a roll of poisonous *tuba* root: again and again he looked but nothing else was there; so he concluded that this was what his wife meant by the sugar cane. He spoke sorrowfully to his neighbours and told them he should not live long, and begged them to be kind to his orphan boy and give him his inheritance: then he returned to his room wrapped a blanket round him and laid himself on the floor chewed the fatal root and joined his wife in deathland.\n\nI have thus traced the general belief of the Sarawak Sea Dyak about his future existence. There are however exceptions to it. Occasionally the idea of metempsychosis is met with. At one time the spirit of a man is said to have passed into an alligator; at another into a snake, etc., the knowledge of it being always revealed by dreams. Sometimes a Dyak will deny the possibility of any future existence; but only I think to serve the purpose of an argument. But these, wherever found, are deviations from the general belief.\n\nBut it is no gloomy Tartarus, nor is it any superior happy Elysium to which the Dyak looks forward; but a simple prolongation of the present state of things in a new sphere. The dead are believed to build houses, make paddy farms, and go through all the drudgery of a labouring life, and to be subject to the same inequalities of condition and of fortune as the living are here. And as men helped each other in life, so death, they think, need not cut asunder the bond of mutual interchanges of kindly service; they can assist the dead with food and other necessaries: and the dead can be equally generous in bestowing upon them medicines of magical virtue,\n\n---\n\n*Cocculus indicus.*\u2014Ed.\namulets and talismans of all kinds to help them in the work of life. This sums up the meaning of their eschatological observances which perhaps exceed those of most other races of mankind.\n\nBut this future life does not, in their minds, extend to an immortality. Death is still the inevitable destiny. Some Dyaks say they have to die three times; others seven times; but all agree in the notion, that after having become degenerated by these successive dyings, they become practically annihilated by absorption into air and fog, or by a final dissolution into various jungle plants not recognized by any name. Maybe, they lack the mental capacity to imagine an endless state of liveable life.\n\nJ. PERHAM.\nTHE HISTORY OF PERAK FROM NATIVE SOURCES.\n\nPAPER under the above title, which was published in No. 9 of this Journal (June, 1882), contains a translation of the later portion of the Perak \"Salsila,\" (chain, genealogy) of the royal family. This ends abruptly with the death of Marhum Muda, which took place about the year 1777. It has been carried on and brought down to 1882 by Raja Haji Yahya, of B\u00e9lanja, in Perak, whose manuscript I have translated. Ungku Haji's work does not profess to be more than a genealogical record, and is not, like the older book, a historical narrative of events. It has not, therefore, the interest of the latter. It is useful, however, as exhibiting the mode of succession which was customary among the Perak Rajas in former times, and as an authentic source from which to ascertain the relative purity of the descent of the surviving members of the royal line in that State.\n\nFor convenience of reference, the names and titles, wherever they occur, of the Rajas who at any time succeeded to the throne of Perak are printed in small capitals.\n\nW. E. MAXWELL.\n\nThis is the genealogy of the Rajas who are in the kingdom of Perak, at present.\n\nMarhum Jalil-ullah* was the grandson of Marhum Kasab of Siak, who was descended from Sang Sapurba of Pagar-ruyong.

The son received the title of Raja Kechik Bongsu, and the daughter was entitled Raja Kechik Ampuan.\n\nRaja Inu married the daughter of Raja Modafar, and had one daughter who was named Raja Budak Kasul; he had another daughter, by a woman of the people, whose name was Raja Tengah Bongsu.\nWhen RAJA RADIN succeeded to the throne, he was proclaimed as Sultan MODAFAR SHAH, and after his death he was known as MARHUM HAJI.\n\nRAJA BISNU was Raja Muda while RAJA RADIN was Sultan, and after him, while RAJA INU reigned. There was a civil war while RAJA INU was Sultan, and the Raja Muda, RAJA BISNU, was raised to the throne, and took the title of SULTAN MUHAMMAD SHAH.* Later, he became Yang di-per-tuan Muda. When he died he was called by the people MARHUM AMINULLAH.\n\nHe had eight children\u2014five sons and three daughters\u2014namely:\n\n1.\u2014RAJA ISKANDAR,\n2.\u2014RAJA KEMAS or Saleh, } by the same mother.\n3.\u2014RAJA ALA-EDDIN.\n4.\u2014Raja Inu Muda.\n5.\u2014RAJA KECHIK BONGSU.\n6, 7, 8.\u2014The names of the daughters are not given.\n\nRAJA PUTEH gave birth to RAJA KHALIM.

This Raja Sherif received the title of Sultan Muda Ala-eddin, and had, by Raja Sabda, two sons and one daughter, namely, Raja Iuu and Raja Alang (often called Raja Alang Pulau), sons, and Raja Itam, daughter.\n\nRaja Alang had two children, of whom one was a daughter who has left a numerous posterity, namely, Rajah Ngah Ami-nah. Rajah Itam married a Saiyid from Trengganu of the Arab tribe Beui Yahya; they had two sons, namely, Raja Ngah Daha (Saiyid Hussein) and Raja Alang Hussein, commonly known as Raja Tua.\n\nWhile Marhum Kahar was Raja Muda, Raja Kemas had the title of Raja Kechik Muda, and when the former became Sultan the latter succeeded as Raja Muda. He eventually succeeded to the throne on the death of Marhum Kahar and took the title of Sultan Muhamadin Shah,* establishing himself at Pasir Pulai, to which place he gave the name of Pulau Besar Indra Mulia. It was he who created a Sultan of Selangor \u2020 by installing there Sultan Sala-eddin, the first Yang di-per-tuan, and his descendants. After the death of Sultan Muhamadin Shah, he was called Marhum Muda. By his wife Raja Kechik Ampuan, he had one son, Raja Ibrahim, who took the title of Raja Kechik Muda \u2021 and begot a son named Raja Mahmud.\n\nAt the time that Marhum Kahar was Sultan, Raja Ala-eddin, son of Marhum Aminullah, was Bandahara, and called himself by the title of \"Bandahara Peningat Itam.\"\n\nHere it is necessary to introduce a story. There were two sisters who upon the death of their father and mother were detained by their uncle as pledges for the repayment of a debt of five dollars due to him by their parents. He employ-\n\n* This name is not given in the account printed on p. 107 of No. 9 of this Journal.\n\u2020 See No. 2 of this Journal, p. 191.\n\u2021 According to Perak tradition, this prince was the first Raja Bandahara. Before his time the title of Bandahara had been held by Chiefs not of royal blood. See Journal No. 2, p. 187.\ned the two girls in looking after his farm (ladang). One day an old woman came there and questioned them, and they explained how they were in a position of slavery in consequence of a debt of five dollars. The woman asked their names, and one of them replied: \"I am called Upik and my sister's name is Dewi.\" Then the old woman said: \"Open your mouth;\" she did so and the old woman spat into it* and touched Dewi in the waist. Then she said: \"I am Nenek Kemang,\" \u2020 and she gave them a tuai (an instrument for plucking padi-ears) and instructed them in the art of rice-cultivation and that is the origin of the knowledge of the cultivation, of padi as it is practised in Kampar and Teja up to the present day.\u2021 (In the name of the God who knoweth!) The old woman said moreover: \"Do not be unhappy, it is no longer in the power of any one to fasten on your skin and bones; your debt is at an end and ye are no longer slaves,\" she then vanished.\n\nWhen the harvest was over and the padi had been taken to the kampong, Raja Bandahara Peningat Itam came up the little river on the bank of which they lived and the people there told him of the exceptional beauty of Che Upik and Che Dewi. He immediately took both of them and they accompanied him down the river. He married Toh Upik, and she bore him a son who was called Raja Abdurrahman.\n\nAfter the death of Marhum Kahar, Raja Kemas became Raja \u00a7; Bandahara Peningat Itam became Raja Muda and Raja Cholan became Bandahara. After the death of Raja Kemas, he was known as Marhum Muda. Raja Muda Ala-eddin then became Raja under the title of Sultan Ala-eddin\n\n---\n\n* This rather objectionable incident, or something like it, occurs in the legend of Badang in the Sajarah Malayu. It is found also in other Perak legends, e.g., that of Toh Kuala Bidor.\n\n\u2020 The legend of Nenek Kemang is ignorantly introduced here as an incident which occurred in the last century. It is an ancient legend which belongs to the pre-Muhammadan times of the Malay nation, and in the folk-lore of Perak Malays the benevolent fairy or goddess is often referred to. Prinuk Nenek Kemang, \"the cooking-pot of Nenek Kemang\" (the contents of which could never be exhausted), is the \"widow's cruise\" of the Malay peasant.\n\n\u2021 As to the belief in a Ceres entertained by Indo-Chinese nations, see Col.

His daughters were called Raja Long Irang and Raja Chu, and his son was called Raja Kasim. The mother of the latter was Inche Mek Anjong; she was the daughter of the Sri Maharaja Lela, Toh Osman, of Kota Lama.\n\nThe Bandahara, Raja Inu, married a sister of Raja Muda Cholan, whose title was Raja Che Puan Tengah; she bore him two sons and one daughter, namely:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Abdurrahim, who married Raja Long Irang, the daughter of Raja Muda Cholan.\n\n2.\u2014Raja Radin, who married Raja Chu, younger sister of Raja Long Irang.\n\n3.\u2014Raja Itam.\n\nWhen Raja Muda Cholan died, he became known among the people as Marhum Pulau Juwar.\u2020 Raja Kasim was then still very young, and his sister Raja Long Irang brought him up.

The original Perak Salsila only carries the history as far as the previous reign (Journal No. 9, p. 107). All therefore that now follows is new.\n\n\u2020 Raja Cholan (Marhum Pulau Juwar) is famous in Perak as the author of the historical work Misa Malayu, which has been described in No. 2 of this Journal, p. 187, and extracts from which will be found in No. 10, p.p. 258, 263. I take this opportunity of correcting a mistake committed in the papers quoted, where Misal is written for Misa. There is a Javanese romance which has been translated into Malay and is very popular in Perak. It is called Hakayat Misa Perbujaya, or simply Misa Jawa. Raja Cholan\u2019s work has been compared by its admirers to the romance in question and has thus come to be called Misa Malayu.

Che Puteh received the title of Toh Dalam and gave birth to one son whose name was Raja Abdul Mulk. The second was Raja Tengah Bongsu, daughter of Marhum Haji by a woman of low birth. She had one son, Raja Inu. The king's third wife was a woman of Katiar named Inche Sri Nayan, daughter of Toh Imam Malik-al-Amin. (This Imam Malik-al-Amin was one of nine brothers, namely Toh Biji Dewa, Toh Saiah Dusun, Toh Lubok, Toh Bujal, Toh Sarambi\u2014these last two went to Aceh\u2014and three others. They were the sons of an Arab named Saiyid Aji by Toh Dusun binti Mrah Chichik Puteh, an Achinese woman of royal blood). The king had one son by Che Sri Nayan, whom he called Raja Abdurrahman. His fourth wife was a woman of Sungkei named Toh Nah binti Toh Samban. She bore him one daughter named Raja Andak. He had one other wife, a woman of Sungei Siput, Che Sinuh by name, who had one daughter, Raja Mandak.\n\nRaja Abdul Mulk married Raja Itam binti Marhum Tengah and had by her two sons and three daughters.

Raja Kechik Besar, Abdul Mulk, his son, then became Raja under the title of Sultan Mansur Shah, and Raja Abdullah, his son, became Raja Muda. The Bandahara, Raja Mahmud, also died. Raja Ngah Laut married Raja Aminah, and became Bandahara. Raja Abdurrahman received the title of Raja Kechik Besar and when he died at Kampong Mangkasar, people spoke of him as Marhum Kampong. Raja Kechik Besar married Che Limah, the sister of Toh Ludin, a native of Kuala Prai, daughter of Wan Bentan, who was the son of Tumonggong Pak Ujan, who first opened Kuala Prai.* Raja Kechik Besar and his wife Che Limah had one son, Raja Abdullah. He married Raja Ngah Aminah, the daughter of Raja Alang and grand-daughter of Sultan Muda Aladdin (Raja Sherif Bisnu), and Raja Cholan, the son of Raja Inu, married Raja Mandak, daughter of Marhum Sayong, and had one son, Raja Mahmud, who died young.

The Raja Bandahara took a second wife, Che Puteh, a woman of Bandar, and had by her a son named Raja Ala-uddin.

Raja Muda Cholan now ascended the throne under the title of Sultan Shahab-uddin Shah, and Raja Bandahara Abdullah, son of Marhum Kampong Mangkasar, became Raja Muda, while Raja di Hilir Ngah J'Affar succeeded him as Raja Bandahara. Sultan Shahab-uddin Shah died, and was known after his death as Marhum Tanjong Penanggar Safi-ullah.

They had two sons:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Osman.\n2.\u2014Raja Omar.\n\nBefore they reached manhood, Raja Ngah Ali divorced (ber-cherei hidop) Puteh Zeleha.\n\n* Anak bangta or anak sabde is the name given in Perak to a child of a Sultan borne after his accession.\nRaja Ismail Hitam, by his wife Raja Fatimah, had two children, the elder of whom was a daughter, Raja Long Khadijah, and the second a son named Raja Lop Ahamad.\n\nWhen Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah died, Raja Muda Ngah J'Affar became Yang-di-per-tuan and took the title of Sultan J'Affar Ma'adam Silah. Raja Ali became Raja Muda and Raja Ismail became Raja Bandahara.\n\nSultan J'Affar and his wife Raja Kechik Puan Besar had one daughter named Raja Long. Her mother died before Raja J'Affar succeeded to the throne and was known after her death by the title of Sha'alum Telok Kapayang Mangkat di Pangkalan Tengah. The Sultan had, by another wife (Che Bulan), a daughter named Raja Ngah, and, by another wife (Che Mahat), a daughter named Raja Nandak and a son named Raja Abdullah. This Raja Abdullah was born on the night of Nasf Sha'aban, and it is said that on that night the water of the well Zem-zem bubbled up and overflowed. Further, a pious Menangkabau man, still living, named Haji Muhammad Ali (who is married to Che Fatimah of Bandar and is known as Tuan Besar Kramat) when he saw the new-born infant, said at the time: \"This child is supernaturally gifted (ber-tuah); take 'the greatest care of him.\"\n\nRaja Long, the Sultan's daughter, married Raja Kechik, the son of a Raja from Riau, and his second daughter, Raja Ngah, married Daing Perbu, the son of a Bugis Raja who was the son of Kraing Chandrapolih, son of the Raja of Bernih (Brunei): and his third daughter, Raja Nandak, married Raja Pandak, son of Marhum Atik-ulliah Mangkat di Durian Sabatang, (Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah).\n\nRaja Abdullah, the son of Sultan J'Affar married Raja Tipah, half sister of Raja Muda Ngah Ali on the mother's side.\n\nSultan J'Affar married another wife called Che Alang Amas, who bore him a son called Raja Musah.\n\nRaja Long had three sons by her husband Raja Kechik of Riau, namely:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Mahmud, who is now at Riau and who has been to Meccah.\n2.\u2014Raja Ngah J'Affar, who lives at Kampar at Kampong Changkat.\n\n3.\u2014Raja (hiatus in M. S.), also at Kampar at the present time.\n\nRaja Ngah bore her husband, Daing Perbu, a daughter named Raja Endah, who married Raja Ngah J'Affar the son of Raja Long.\n\nRaja Nandak and her husband Raja Pandak had three sons:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Ibrahim.\n2.\u2014Raja Ali.\n3.\u2014Raja Alang.\n\nRaja Pandak had been previously married, before he married Raja Nandak, to a woman of the lower class named Che Long, daughter of Toh Marat of Pulau Tiga, and by her he had one son named Raja Mahmud.\n\nAfter Sultan J'Affar died, he was always spoken of by the title of Marhum Oulia-ullah di Pasir Panjang. Raja Muda Noah Ali then ascended the throne, and his title while Sultan was \"Almatukkal billah il jali Paduka Sri Sultan al mukmel 'Anayat Shah el Perak dar el riduan.\"*\n\nRaja Abdullah, son of the late Sultan, became Raja Muda, the Bandahara, Raja Ismail Hitam, retained that office, and it was by his wish and consent that Raja Abdullah was made Raja Muda.\n\nRaja Osman, son of the new Sultan, married Raja Long Khadijah, daughter of Raja Bandahara Ismail, and had no issue.\n\nAfter the Sultan (Ali) had reigned for a time, he died at Kuala Manora at the house of Che Rajab, and was buried at Gedong Siam at Sayong. The title given to him after his death was Marhum Naji-ullah.\n\nAt this time, Raja Abdullah was down the river and though he was sent for repeatedly he did not come.\u2020 There was then a\n\n* \"He who places all his confidence in the just God, Paduka Sri Sultan el mukmel 'Anayat Shah of Perak, the abode of Paradise.\"\n\n\u2020 The custom quoted by the Perak Chiefs in explanation of their action in passing over the Raja Muda (see Blue-Book c. 1111, p. 118) is common to several Indo-Chinese nations, e.g. the Siamese, Journ. Ind. Arch. I, 344, and the Cambodians, Mouin, Le Royaume de Cambodge, I, 347. In Timor the body of a deceased king remains unburned till the relatives can afford to provide the burial feast.

Not long after this, Raja Muda Abdullah came to an agreement with the Chiefs down the river, at the head of whom was the Laksamana Muhammad Amin, that he should be recognised as Sultan under the title of \"El 'ashik billah\u2020 Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah, Yang-di-per-Tuan, Perak,\" and he at once went to Singapore where Governor Ord was then stationed as the Governor of the Straits Settlements. Soon after he returned to Perak, there was a change of Governors and Sir Andrew Clarke became Governor and after reaching Singapore came on to Pangkor, where he confirmed Sultan Abdullah as Yang-di-per-Tuan of Perak, Sultan Ismail becoming Ex-Sultan, that is to say, Sultan Muda. The Colonial Secretary, Mr. J. W. Birch was then appointed Resident of Perak. Again there was a change of Governors in Singapore, and Sir William Jervois became Governor. Then the death of Mr. Birch at Pasir Salak took place, and the Sultan (Ismail) retired from Pangkalan Peguh. Then Captain Dunlop and Major McNair became Queen's Commissioners in Perak and afterwards Mr. Davidson became Resident. After this, Sultan Abdullah and the Laksamana and the Shabandar were taken away to Singapore and thence to Pulau Seychelles. Then Mr. Hugh Low became Resident of Perak and Mr. Maxwell became Assistant Resident and governed Larut. Raja Muda Yusuf became Regent of Perak, and Raja Idris, son of Marhum Bandahara Iskandar, became Hakim of Perak.\n\nRaja Muda Yusuf, Regent of Perak, begot two children, a daughter named Raja Nutih, and a son, Raja Ilop Mansur. He had another son, by a concubine, Raja Muhammad Ajam; and another son, by a woman called Zenab (to whom he was never married), who was named Raja Pendawa. By a woman named Alang Malaka (whom he married) he has a son named Raja\n\n* \"The covering of the protecting mantle of God.\"\n\u2020 \"The friend of God.\"\nJohar. Thus, at the date at which this record is drawn up the children of the Regent are five in number, but judging from his robustness, it is possible that he may still beget more.\n\nThe mother of Raja Nutih and Raja Mansur (the Regent's elder children) was Toh Puan Fatimah, the daughter of Raja Indra Bongsu by Toh Mandu who held the office of bantara to Marhum Durian Sabatang, father of the Regent.

By another woman, Ngah Manih, Raja Idris has two sons, Raja Abdul Hamid and Raja Alang Iskandar and one daughter Raja Ngah.\n\nRaja Mansur, younger brother of Raja Nutih, married Raja Long, daughter of Raja Alang Mamat, and had a son named Raja Abdul Majid.\n\nRaja Muhammad Ajam, son of the Regent, married Khatijah, a woman of Kota Lama, and had one daughter named Raja Long.\n\nUngku Muda Raja Ismail Putch, or, as he was generally called in his old age, Toh Ungku Ismail Putch, married another wife, Raja Alang Sabda, daughter of Raja Hussein, elder brother of Sultan Ismail.

All the property which Raja Ismail and Raja Puteh acquired, subsequent to the time of the marriage of Raja Ismail Itam with Raja Teh Fatimah\u2014lands, houses, mines, slaves, elephants and buffaloes, they made over to Raja Haji Yahya while he was still quite young and they are his to this day.\n\nThe end.\n\nWritten on Wednesday, the 7th day of Jamad-ul-akhir, A. H. 1299, at Kampong Belanja.\nBRITISH NORTH BORNEO.*\n\nIntroduction.\n\nThe object of this paper is to give a short and general sketch of the territory under the Government of British North Borneo Company, from personal observations made during a residence of nearly three years in the country, and from the official reports of Messrs. Pryer, Von Donop, Frank Hatton and Wittl.\n\nArea.\n\nEmbracing an area of some 20,000 square miles, and a coast line of about 500 miles, the territory lies between the 116th and 119th degrees of East longitude, and the 4th and 7th parallels of North latitude.\n\nGeographical Features.\n\nThe general geographical features of the country are as follows:\u2014A range of mountains\u2014the general direction of which is North-East and South-West\u2014forms a backbone through the heart of the country, varying in height from 4,000, 7,000 and 8,000 feet in the mountains of Melaio, Mentapok and Trodan, respectively, until the altitude of 13,698 feet is attained by the rugged peaks of Kina Balu, which tower above the surrounding country, repelling with precipitous ascent the adventurer who would attain their summits. From this range and descending to the coast on either side, are lesser ranges of\n\n* See a paper, with this title, by Sir Walter Medhurst, read at a meeting of the Royal Colonial Institute this year.\u2014Ed.\nhills covered for the most part with virgin forest, and interspersed with fertile plains, watered by the numerous rivers which wend their circuitous courses to the sea beyond. The coast, as a rule, is low and flat and is, to a large extent, lined with the handsome casuarina tree, broken by stretches of mangrove, denoting swampy ground or the mouths of rivers, and diversified by low sandstone cliffs, yellow from exposure to the weather, or patches of forest reaching to the water's edge.\n\nAt a short distance from the shore on the West coast, a very large area of country is denuded of trees, and lalang, a coarse grass (*Andropogon caricosum*), has spread over it, except where here and there the plantations of the natives vary its monotony.\n\n**Harbours.**\n\nMany indentations occur on the coast, and the country is particularly rich in harbours, the principal being Gaya, Ambong and Usikan on the West coast, Kudat on the North, and Sandakan on the East. The importance of these harbours it needs but a glance at the map to realize, containing as they do, amongst other advantages, natural facilities for defence.\n\n**Sandakan.**\n\nSandakan harbour it will be seen, lies but a short distance from the track taken by trading vessels between Australia and China, and is indeed but five hours steaming distance from their course. It is extremely well protected, and contains anchorage for any number of vessels; having an extent of fifteen miles in length, by five miles in breadth.\n\n**Kudat and Gaya.**\n\nKudat and Gaya harbours are within a few hours steam of the route, through the Palawan passage, taken by ships trading from the West to China and Japan. The value of these harbours, therefore, as coaling stations, and refuges for our mercantile navy, in the event of a war with a naval power,\ncannot be overrated, and it follows, that it is of the highest importance that they should not be in the hands of any foreign and possibly hostile power.\n\nThe value of these harbours, in addition to their strategical importance, is enhanced by the rich country lying at their back. This is especially the case with regard to Sandakan, into which flow some fifteen rivers, taking their courses, for the most part, through a country which is without doubt a field for large sugar and tobacco plantations, and containing a supply of timber which, from its easy access, should be a great source of revenue to the Government.\n\nRivers.\n\nThe principal rivers in the territory are the Kimanis, Papar, Putatan, Abai, and Tampasuk, on the West Coast, Paitan and Sugut on the North, and Sibuco and Kinabatangan on the East. Most of these rivers are navigable for steam launches of light draught, for although, as a rule, deep water is found inside the entrance, all the rivers are more or less barred. The Kinabatangan is navigable for some 200 miles. Rising in the ranges south of Kina Balu, it takes its course to the sea, emerging some twenty miles south of Sandakan harbour, after passing through a very thinly populated country covered for the most part with virgin forest, varied by occasional native plantations, or patches of secondary jungle denoting where former clearings have been. The quantity of floating timber met with, in the rivers, renders careful navigation necessary.\n\nNorth Borneo as a field for the Planter.\n\nNorth Borneo as a new field for the crowded-out planters of Ceylon and Sumatra, is not to be surpassed, for in its hills and valleys will be found soil suitable to almost every tropical product. Hapion in the New Ceylon writes as follows, and his remarks are confirmed by experts from personal observations:\u2014\n\n\"The spurs and slopes of Kina Balu are peculiarly fitted for growing coffee, tea and cinchona, while the rich plains that\n\"mark the course of the Kinabatangan and other rivers lend\nthemselves to the culture of indigo, tobacco, cotton, rice and\nthe other well-known tropical products. Such villages as the\ntraveller meets with on excursions in the interior, are fed and\nmaintained by agriculture, the successful features of which,\nbelong to the natural fertility of the soil, rather than to the\nscience of the native farmer. . . . You cross a plain of rice,\nbananas, cocoa-nut trees and other luxuriant vegetation. You\nsee the native cultivator at work, his rude plough drawn by\nbuffaloes, and flocks of white paddy birds sailing aloft, or a\nfew solitary cranes adding an oriental touch to the picture.\nYou halt on the river bank amidst tropical groves, here and\nthere relieved by neatly kept gardens, fenced down to the\nwater's edge, and containing plentiful supplies of sweet pota-\ntoes, cucumbers, maize and kaladi.\"\n\nTobacco.\n\nThat the country is peculiarly adapted for the growth of\ntobacco, is demonstrated by the fact of its cultivation by the\nnatives of both coasts, and that in spite of the want of care in\nits production, an excellent leaf is obtained. A sample of leaf\nfrom a newly opened plantation on the East Coast, has been\npronounced by experts to be unsurpassed. Such being the case,\nand considering that the available land in the tobacco producing\ncountries is becoming exhausted, it is reasonable to suppose that\nthis country will, in a short time, take a prominent place as a\nlarge producer of tobacco.\n\nSugar.\n\nSugar is also cultivated to some extent and in some parts\nof the country; a primitive mill for crushing is used by the\nnatives. Considering, however, the small profit returned,\ntogether with the known risks in cultivation, the substitutes for\ncane which are being brought into the market, and the com-\nparatively low rate at which labour is obtained in the sugar\nproducing countries, it is doubtful whether this product will be\ncultivated to any large extent.\nGambier.\n\nGambier (the inspissated juice of *Nauclea gambir*, an astringent used in dying and tanning), the cultivation of which has met with such success in the neighbouring state of Sarawak, pepper, tea and *coffee arabica*, have all been proved suitable, and sago which is indigenous to the country would largely repay for planting in the low lying grounds at the entrances to rivers.\n\nJungle Products.\n\nEspecially is this country rich in natural jungle products, such as gutta percha, india rubber, camphor, canes, and an infinite variety of useful and ornamental woods, including the valuable *bilian* (iron-wood) and ebony.\n\nCamphor\n\nThe camphor of Borneo, (*Dryobalanops camphora*) is noted for its peculiar medicinal properties, and is highly valued by the Chinese, who will give, according to the variation of the market, from twenty to forty dollars a pound for the best.\n\nBorneo, with its natural advantages in waterways, should export its timber largely to China, and no doubt when labour becomes more abundant, this will be the case.\n\nFirewood.\n\nA market for firewood has been already established in Hongkong, and the supply of mangrove which is unequalled for this purpose, is practically inexhaustible, and can be obtained without any difficulty. The bark of this tree, which has to be removed in its preparation as firewood, has its own special value as producing a reddish dye much used by the Chinese.\n\nEdible Birds' Nests.\n\nAnother valuable and increasing product is the edible\nbirds' nest, which is obtained in small quantities on the West coast, and adjacent islands, but is chiefly supplied from the Gomanton caves on the East coast. The following description of these caves is condensed from an account lately published in the Straits Times. The caves are situate on the Kinabatangan river, near the village of Malapi, which is some fifty miles from the mouth. The chief entrance Simud putih (white entrance) is on the Gomanton hill at an elevation of 500 feet, and is about 30 feet high by 50 feet wide. The ascent to it is very steep, in some parts almost perpendicular, but the nature of the jagged hard lime-stone rocks, affords holding points for one's hands and feet. From this entrance the ascent to the summit of the hill, is another 500 feet, and at the top is a smallish hole which leads into the great Simud putih caves below, going straight down about 850 feet. Down this the natives descend by rattan ladders, fastened to the circumference of the hole, right into the abyss below, in search of the nests. At nightfall a remarkable sight is to be seen at the entrance, viz., the return of the swallows (Collocalia esculenta) to their nests, and the departure of the bats. With a whirring sound, multitudes of bats wheel round in spiral columns from the summit of which detachments break off and wheel away rapidly towards the mangrove swamps and the nipa palms. Amongst them the white bats are very conspicuous, and are termed by the natives, the Rajah, his wife and child. Soon after the bats emerge from the caves, the swallows return in countless numbers. Each morning the process is reversed, the swallows going out and the bats returning home. On entering the mouth of the cave as described above, the floor for the first part of the way slopes down at an angle of twenty-five degrees, to an enormous cave with several smaller ones leading out of it. From the side of this cave rises a high dome, from the top of which you can see the opening before-mentioned, some 850 above. The average height of the cave before coming to the dome is 150 feet. The next cave Simud itam (black entrance) is on a level with the river bank. The entrance is by a magnificent porch of 250 feet in height, opening out into a large and lofty chamber, beyond which an open space is reached, from which looking up can be seen the Simud putih.\nFrom this space is a cave running under the Scmud Pufih series which is filled, halfway to the top with bats' guano, which cannot be less than fifty feet in depth. Its extent is unknown. Samples of the guano have been sent home and were valued at from \u00a38 to \u00a315 per ton. The annual value taken from these caves is $25,000.\n\nCoal.\n\nThat coal is present in many parts of the territory, has been proved, and boring for workable deposits, is being actively engaged in. The present supply, which is stored at the principal ports of call, for the use of men-of-war and trading vessels, is obtained from the Moara mines, situate at the mouth of the Brunei River and which have been leased by the Sultan of Brunei to the Labuan firm of Messrs. Cowie Brothers. The quality of the coal has been well reported upon by engineers of Her Majesty's ships and others, and it is used to a large extent by those vessels visiting Borneo and Labuan, as well as by all the local trading steamers. There are five seams now being worked, of 26, 24, 6, 5 and 4 feet in thickness respectively.\n\nMinerals.\n\nFrom the reports of travelers and others, the mineral wealth of Borneo has been much exaggerated, although the numerous indications are sufficient to have caused them. Gold indeed is found in Dutch Borneo and Sarawak, but in comparatively small quantities. Traces of gold have also been found in North Borneo, and the island of Banguey off the North coast, and samples of auriferous quartz have lately been discovered in the vicinity of Marudu Bay and in rivers flowing into Sandakan Bay. Up to the present, however, the search has been unsuccessful, and this is not to be wondered at, when we consider how everything is hidden by a luxuriant vegetation which jealously guards the treasures of the earth from the eyes of the explorer. Samples of cinnabar, silver ore, antimony and tin have been found in different parts of the territory. Copper also was being traced by the late Mr. Frank Hatton, the Company's mineralogist, who was confident of its existence.\nbut his lamented and sad death has temporarily put a stop to the search for it. The same formations in which the silver ore and antimony are found in Sarawak, are also met with in parts of North Borneo, and from specimens which have been brought in by the natives, it is reasonable to suppose that a systematic search would disclose workable deposits.\n\n*Mother-o\u2019pearl.*\n\nThe sea also has treasures which form no small item of export, such as mother-o\u2019pearl, b\u00eache-de-mer (*holothuria,*), and tortoise shell. The neighbouring oyster beds in the Sulu sea have lately been attracting the attention of Europeans, with a view to the introduction of proper appliances for the effective working of the beds, which is impossible with the primitive means employed by the natives. There is no doubt that as the European government becomes known and appreciated, the pearl oyster beds, which unquestionably exist round the coasts, will be made to yield their riches. The grasping natures of the innumerable petty chiefs of a former r\u00e9gime, who oppressed the unfortunate pearl fishers, until their occupation\u2014arduous and dangerous as it was\u2014brought them no profit, is the cause assigned by the old men for the abandonment of the pursuit, and the consequent losing sight of the exact locality of the beds. On one occasion, whilst searching for an oyster bed in a locality pointed out by an old man living on one of the small islands off the coast, the divers who accompanied the writer, obtained over a hundredweight of mother-o\u2019pearl, valued at $45, but all the shells were isolated, and it was evident that only the outlying members of the true bed had been found.\n\n*Fauna.*\n\nBeasts of prey are conspicuous by their absence, the one known exception being a small tree tiger (*Felis macrocelis*) which is found in the interior. Deer of various kinds, wild pigs, wild cattle (*Bos gaurus*), and buffalo, are abundant, and\nafford capital sport, whilst on the East coast are found in addition the elephant and rhinoceros (*R. sumatranus*). Journeying up the rivers, many varieties of the monkey tribe are met with, including a small species of orang-utan. Small black bears (*Helarctos euryspilus*) are occasionally met with.* The tapir and other have been seen on the North coast. A large variety of squirrels abound. Amongst the snakes are found the cobra, python, and leaf snake (*Trimeresurus subannulatus*), but the writer has not known a single fatal case of snake-bite during a residence of six years in Borneo.\n\nCrocodiles are numerous, and at times extremely fierce and dangerous. The rivers and coast teem with fish, which form the staple food of a large portion of the inhabitants.\n\nPigeons of many kinds, snipe, curlew and plover, the Argus and Bulwer pheasants (*Argusianus Grayii* and *Lobiophasis Bulweri*; \u2020) and several kinds of partridge afford a tempting variety to the sportsman, and the field opened up to the naturalist amongst the numerous birds of North Borneo, is a large and but little known one.\n\n**Climate.**\n\nThe climate is more healthy than might be expected in a country situated so near the Equator. The maximum monthly mean temperature during the year 1883 was 83.9, whilst the lowest for the same period was 75.1. The nights as a rule are very cool and pleasant, and on the coast the heat during the day is rarely oppressive. The rainfall for 1883, as observed at Kudat, on the North coast, was 120.56 inches, November, December and January being the months during which most rain fell. There is no absolutely dry season, it being rare to pass many days without rain. To Europeans who take reasonable precautions against exposure to malarial influences, the climate is healthy.\n\n---\n\n* Sir Stamford Raffles described the Malayan bear before the Linnean Society in 1820. Crawfurd says that the Bornean and Sumatran bears are the same species.\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 This is an error. The Bulwer Pheasant (*Lobiophasis Bulweri*) has not come under the knowledge of the author. The birds referred to are two species of the Fireback Pheasant, the *Euplocanus pyrrhnotus* and the *Euplocanus nubilis*.\nPopulation.\n\nNorth Borneo is very thinly populated and its scattered inhabitants include many different races.\n\nThe West coast is principally peopled by a mixture of Malays, Bajaus and Ilanuns, whilst on the North and East coasts Bajaus and Sulus are chiefly met with. The aborigines who reside in the interior are called Dusuns or Ida'an. They are an agricultural race, and generally peaceful. They grow tobacco and cotton, as well as rice, tapioca, yams and indian corn, but only cultivate sufficient for their own immediate use\u2014the usual habit of most natives of these parts, who fail to realize the importance of providing for the future. They use a plough and harrow, and in this respect are superior to the other natives of Borneo, although the use of these implements is said to have been introduced by the Chinese who\u2014report tells us\u2014at some remote period thickly populated North Borneo.\n\nLabour.\n\nFor purposes of labour, the native cannot be depended upon, being naturally indolent and quite content so long as his own immediate wants are satisfied, and these being simple, he finds no difficulty in supplying them. Chinese at present supply the labour market. Chinese, natives of India, and Arabs are to be found trading in most of the rivers, and the first named are settling in large numbers wherever stations have been opened by the Company, more especially at Sandakan, which now contains some 3,000.\n\nA rough estimate of the population gives the number as 150,000, but this is probably underrated, as it is being rapidly increased by the influx of Chinese. The value of the Chinese in a new country like this, is well known, and as a pioneer, his assistance in making the Government known to the natives of the interior, amongst whom he intrepidly ventures, alone or with but one or two companions, speaking imperfectly if at all their language, will be readily acknowledged by those who have experienced it.\nSlavery.\n\nOne great benefit which will follow on the establishment of a Government by Europeans, will be the gradual abolition of slavery, which, however mild it may be in this country, is repugnant to civilised humanity. By recent laws promulgated by the Government, the death blow to the various modes of obtaining slaves has been struck, the following regulations effectually accomplishing this object:\u2014(1.) No slaves can be imported from other countries. (2.) Debtors cannot be seized by their creditors, which was formerly one of the principal means of obtaining slaves. (3.) All children born of slave parents after November, 1883, and who would, according to custom, be slaves also, are declared free.\n\nMost of the inhabitants of the coast are Mahomedans, whilst the aborigines put their faith in omens and old superstitions.\n\nFuture Prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiment in colonization now being tried by the British North Borneo Company, is one of more than local importance, and is being anxiously watched by other nations whose interests in those seas are so great.\n\nWith the example of what has been done in the Native States, and Sarawak, and by governing through and with the assistance of the natives themselves\u2014which is indeed the only true way in a country such as this\u2014the young colony should, within a reasonable time, realize the expectations it has aroused, by taking a position corresponding to its natural advantages, and sending forth its riches to the other countries of the world.*\n\nE. P. GUERITZ.\n\n[This paper was prepared at the suggestion of Mr. J. S. O'HALLORAN, Secretary of the Royal Colonial Institute, by whom it was read, on my behalf, at the Montreal Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, on the 29th August, 1884.\u2014E. P. G.]\n\n* The information in this paper may be fitly supplemented by the following\nremarks made by Mr. A. Dent when Sir Walter Medhurst's paper on British North Borneo was read before the Royal Colonial Institute on the 12th May, 1885:\u2014\"The progress in North Borneo has not been so rapid as was anticipated when we obtained the charter at the end of 1881, but still we can certainly point to steady progress since the company took possession in July, 1882. I find that the fiscal revenue for 1884 as compared with 1883 shows an increase of 60 per cent., land sales a decrease of 39 per cent., leaving a total increase of 28 per cent., which, considering the state of trade and universal depression, must, I think be thought not wholly unsatisfactory. Sir Walter has alluded to several new imports and exports. We hope in 1885 to show an export of gold. Last autumn we sent one of our best officers to explore for gold in the Segama and Kinabatangan rivers, and his report showed gold to exist in alluvial deposits in the 30 or 40 places experimented upon. He could not continue his explorations, owing to the wet season having just set in, but has recently gone back, and we hope soon to hear it confirmed that there are workable deposits of gold in the country. That the Governor and officials of North Borneo believe in it is evidenced by their having taken the trouble to publish regulations and proclaim certain districts as gold fields. Tobacco we look forward to as likely to prove an important enterprise in the country. This, as the paper says, is advancing but slowly, for, owing to many difficulties which occur in a new country, the 1884 crop did not come up to expectations. Considerable preparations have, however, been made for planting during the coming season. In February last one company had 330 coolies working on their plantation, and another company 100 coolies. From all accounts, this tobacco is likely to prove equal to the finest Sumatra. It is used for covering purposes. In sugar little has been done as yet, but large tracts of country have been taken by Australians, Chinese, and others. There seems to be a fair prospect that the depression in this trade will soon pass away, for prices have recently advanced 30 per cent. There is some reason to believe that the German Government are getting tired of the system of bounties, for I believe it is a fact that the sugar manufacturers and growers of beetroot in Germany owe the Government something like ten millions sterling, and the authorities are beginning to wonder whether they will ever see their money again. As regards timber, our export for 1884 amounted to $10,000. Part went to Australia and part of China. There is a great variety of timber in Borneo, some of the hardest woods in the world being found there. The Billian, or iron wood, is plentiful, and valuable for railway sleepers, wharves, &c.; and some other woods are suited for furniture, ship-building, and other purposes. One of the Chinese merchants has 200 men cutting timber for the China market, and the Australians are cutting timber freely for the Melbourne market. The report upon the experimental garden at Silam states that Liberian coffee, now rising to its third year, is very fine, and yielding freely. The younger plantations at Sandakan promise well. The growth of pepper is all that could be desired. Cocoa, Manila hemp, and gambia are, amongst other articles, easily produced in the territory. One of the main questions remaining for consideration is that of labour. Everywhere the question seems to be how, and where, to get labour. Many restrictions are, we know, put upon the importing of Chinese into America and Australia,\nbut those who have lived as long as I have amongst the Chinese will testify to their value if they are treated properly. One advantage with this labour is that you can make contracts, and payment by results, by which means you can get the maximum amount of labour at the minimum of expense. Borneo is but a few days' steam from China and Singapore, where, for a moderate wage, an unlimited amount of this labour can be obtained. Anyone who has studied the map will, I think, recognise that, commercially and strategically, North Borneo occupies a position of great importance. Lying on the high road between China and Australia, we must in time get a large population there. The climate I can speak well of. I have lived there many months at different times of the year. The Government of the country is based, as Sir Walter has told us, on the Indian penal code, and the administration seems to meet the wishes of the natives and the Chinese, and the other settlers. A force of 180 police has hitherto been sufficient to keep order with comparative ease. As to the charter, some friends of the enterprise seem to believe that the enormous powers we hold were given by Her Majesty the Queen. It is not so at all. All our powers were derived entirely from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and what the British Government did was simply to incorporate us by Royal charter, thus recognising our powers, which recognition is to us, of course, of vital importance. I hope I have said enough to interest you in our scheme, and to show that North Borneo has a considerable future before it.\u201d\n\nEd.\nJELEBU.\n\nThe following Notes, regarding the history of the constitution of Jelebu have been compiled from information gleaned from the headmen of the State.*\n\nThe four following countries\u2014(1) Jelebu, (2) Sungei Ujong, (3) Rembau, and (4) Johol\u2014were in former days governed by Penghulus subject to the suzerainty of Johor.\n\nOn one occasion the Raja of Johor was guilty of an act of gross oppression towards the Penghulu of Rembau entitled Orang Kaya Kechil. The Raja of Johor wished to obtain in marriage this Penghulu\u2019s daughter, but the Penghulu refused and married her to another. The Raja\u2019s anger was roused at this, and the Penghulu, hearing of his indignation sent his own son Si\u00e2mat (sic) to explain matters to the Raja and to endeavour to appease his wrath.\n\nThe Raja, however, would not listen to Si\u00e2mat, but ordered him to be put to death.\n\nAfter this the Penghulus of the four States were afraid to go to the Court of the Raja, owing to this unjust act.\n\nAfter some time, however, the headman of Jelebu took courage to appear before him. Now this headman\u2019s name was Munyong Salih, and his title was Orang Kaya of Sungei Lumut. The name of Jelebu was as yet unknown; and it was not until some time later that the country was so called after a man of that name who was drowned in the river (Triang). This headman of Jelebu, then, went to the Court of the Raja of Johor, who presented him with a chop bearing the following inscription:\n\n\"The Sultan Ma'adam Shah confers upon the Mandelika Mantri supreme authority to be the Sultan of Jelebu for ever.\"\n\n* The first division of this paper is, I need hardly point out, a literal translation of the story verbally communicated to me by Malays.\u2014H. A. O'B.\nAnd this is the form of words that has been used from generation to generation by the Penghulus who have governed the country of Jelebu.\n\nThe Raja of Johor further issued instructions to the Penghulu, that from that time forth the Penghulus of Jelebu and of the other three States were not to bring their complaints before Johor.\n\nThereupon the four Penghulus made an arrangement to create a Raja of their own, and chose a man of the royal blood of Menangkabau, who on his election abode in the country of Sri Menanti.\n\nThe place where the election of this Raja occurred was P\u00e9t\u00e2jeh, and hence arises the old Malay saying: \"The source of royal power is P\u00e9t\u00e2jeh; the place where it dwells is Sri Menanti.\" A Yam Tuan Muda in Rembau, and a Yam Tuan Besar in Sri Menanti, such was the (new) order of things, and the four Penghulus no longer took their complaints to Johor, but to Sri Menanti, and had thus a Menangkabau man as their ruler.\n\nAt that time there was no Yam Tuan in Jelebu, but the Penghulu held sway in that country, and this state of things continued for a long time.\n\nAt length the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti, who had a number of sons, sent one of them to Jelebu, merely to take up his abode there and to till the ground. His conduct was long watched by all the officers of Jelebu, and they saw that it was very good. His behaviour towards the people was good, and he seemed to be a man capable of supporting and sustaining the country. He was also a man of considerable mental ability, and his personal character was beyond reproach.\n\nAccordingly all the officers met together and notified to the Penghulu their intention * of making the Yam Tuan's (Sri Menanti) son their supreme ruler.\n\nHe was accordingly elected with the title of Yam Tuan of Jelebu, with the duties of protector of the inhabitants of that country. He did not, however, receive any jurisdiction in the country, and the Penghulu and the officers contributed to his support, each man as much as he could afford.\n\n* This account of the attitude of the Waris and Lembagas in these early times is noteworthy as bearing upon the present constitution of the country.\nThe district within which the Yam Tuan's authority extended was from Bandar Berangan up to Sungei Melentang, that is to say, to Batu Gominting (in other words, a portion of what is now Klawang).\n\nSuch was the limit of his private and direct rule from that time down to the time of his descendant at the present day.\n\nAnd should he violate this understanding or the customs of the country he may be deposed by his officers.\n\n\"If a king be just he is reverenced if unjust checked.\"*\n\nSuch was the order of things in former times, and the boundary of Jelebu with Pahang is the place called Meranti Sembilan, \u2020 while the boundary with Sungei Ujong is Bukit Tangga.\n\nNow Klawang is said to belong to Sungei Ujong for the following reasons.\n\nSome time ago a son of the Datu Penghulu of Jelebu violated a daughter of the Penghulu of Klambu, and was compelled to marry her. Sufficient money to pay the fine exacted was not forthcoming, and so in place of a money payment the Penghulu of Jelebu gave Klawang (to Sungei Ujong), that is to say, so much of it as is on the right as one goes up stream to Sungei Ujong and down stream so far as Lubok Kerbau Balir. For any measure that the Yam Tuan wishes to take in the district thus defined, he must first obtain the sanction of the Government of Sungei Ujong.\n\n---\n\nSuch is the account of the origin of the present Government which obtains in Jelebu, taken from the lips of those who are most likely to be informed on the subject and who are unanimous in their story.\n\nI may append a short account of the constitution of Jelebu as I found it when I visited it about the middle of the present\n\n* The headmen hold that the present Yam Tuan has violated the constitution, and he now resides in Klawang, with an allowance from the British Government contingent upon his non-interference in the government of Jelebu.\n\n\u2020 This appears to have been the old Jakun boundary. It is low down on the Triang river, is decidedly Pahang in its tendencies, and does not acknowledge the Penghulu.\nyear (1884) and in what follows, for the purposes of simplicity, I venture to leave out of consideration the recent arrangements made with the rulers of Jelebu.\n\nThere is still a Yam Tuan of Jelebu* although practically he may be regarded as a cipher. He arrogated to himself powers of interference in the internal government of the country, which the Penghulu and the Waris considered to be a violation of the conditions under which the office of Yam Tuan was established, and he was ordered by them in 1880 to leave Jelebu and reside in Sri Menanti. A composition was, however, effected in his behalf, and he now resides in Klawang near the Jelebu frontier. Theoretically he still continues to be the Protector of the people, but I have not learnt that any point has been referred to him since his removal from the country, except in the case of an informal grant of land recently made to an European company in Jelebu, and again in the case of the Pahang boundary question, when he expressed his opinion to the Government at my request.\n\nThe Penghulu, therefore, Syed Ali bin Zin, is the ruler of the country, for all practical purposes. I may say the undisputed ruler, as the Yam Tuan signed a bond in January of the present year undertaking not again to interfere in the government of the State.\n\nThe Penghulu is assisted in the conduct of affairs by nine officers, or perhaps it would be more correct to describe his jurisdiction as limited by them. They are entitled Lembagas, of whom there are five, and Waris, who are four in number. The Lembagas have each a separate title:\n\n1.\u2014Datu Mantri.\n2.\u2014Datu Ngiang.\n3.\u2014Datu Chinchang.\n4.\u2014Datu Sendara.\n5.\u2014Datu Lela Angsa.\n\nThese officers are all entitled to a vote in every act of State, and any act done without their concurrence is illegal. At the State Council, however, they may, in case of illness and so on, be represented by authenticated Wakils. The entire land of Jelebu is considered to be vested in them and the Waris, but under no circumstances can a Lembaga rise to the office of Penghulu.\n\n* Since deceased\u201413th December, 1884.\u2014Ed.\nThe Waris are entitled as follows:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Balang.\n2.\u2014Maharaja Indah.\n3.\u2014Raja Penghulu.\n4.\u2014Datu Umbei.\n\nThey also have a vote in the State Council, and the Penghulu is elected from their body with two reservations.\n\nThe Datu Umbei cannot become Penghulu, nor can the Raja Penghulu. A member of the family of the latter officer may, however, become a candidate for election.\n\nThe succession would appear to follow a fixed rule, viz., that on the death of a Penghulu who has been of the family of a Raja Penghulu, the Raja Balang of the day is elected. At his death the Maharaja Indah of the day succeeds, and is again succeeded as Penghulu by a member of the family of the Raja Penghulu.\n\nThis rule is theoretically absolute, but has often been broken through, and in all cases the appointment must be ratified by the unanimous vote of the Lembagas.\n\nThe Datu Mantri is the head of the Lembagas, with the full title of \"Datu Mantri Shah Memangku Alam.\" The full title of the Datu Umbei (father of the Waris) is \"Datu Umbei Pangkal Maharaja Lela.\"\n\nAccording to old custom, the Datu Lela Angsa was appointed by the Penghulu to protect the Yam Tuan, and the Penghulu when he wished to obtain an audience of the Yam Tuan applied to do so to the Datu Mantri, who laid the request before the Datu Lela Angsa.\n\nThe Yam Tuan has, however, no followers now, with the exception of an ex-Maharaja Indah, who was deposed for supporting him in acts of oppression, and who resides with him in Klawang. Similarly in former days the Yam Tuan had four officers attached to his household, who now exist no longer. Their titles were:\n\n1\u2014Bruang Sati who was chosen by the Datu Sendara.\n2\u2014Penglima Prang, Datu Mantri.\n3\u2014Penglima Mamat, Datu Chinchang.\n4\u2014Penglima Prang No. 2, Datu Ngiang.\n\nThe Lembagas had thus a direct control over the internal\naffairs of the Yam Tuan\u2019s household, but, as I have said, all this is at an end now.\n\nThe Penghulu has four officers attached to his person, who are in like manner appointed and removed by the Waris.\n\n1\u2014Penglima Garang is chosen by the Datu Mantri.\n2\u2014Penglima Hitam, Datu Ngiang.\n3\u2014Penglima Sutan No. 1, Datu Chinchang.\n4\u2014Penglima Sutan No. 2, Datu Sendara.\n\nThe Penghulu, though in theory above control, is in reality entirely under the direction of the Lembagas and Waris, who, if unanimous, can obtain any constitutional change in the country they may desire by observing the following routine.\n\nIf a measure is originated at the unanimous desire of the Lembagas, it is submitted by them to the Waris, and vice versa. Should it obtain the concurrence of the party which is not its originator, it is submitted in due form to the Penghulu, who has the power of veto, but who in practice accepts what is laid before him with but little discussion. After this step has been taken, the measure (until recently) is transmitted to the Yam Tuan for final ratification, and when this has been obtained, the measure becomes law, binding upon the inhabitants of the country generally.\n\nThis process may appear to be rather too involved to work without friction in a Malay State, but there can be no doubt but that it contains elements of safety for the ryot from its very complexity.\n\nThe ex-Raja Balang left Jelebu and has reappeared with the Pahang envoy supporting his theory that Jelebu has always been Pahang territory, and that Jelebu as a separate State is non-existent.*\n\nWhatever may be the real status of Jelebu, the present condition of the country is truly deplorable. It bears marks of having been, at no very distant period, fairly prosperous and sufficiently peopled, but now, speaking generally, the whole land is waste.\n\nI passed the other day through mile after mile of deserted kampongs with fine padi land all round in abundance and with fruit-trees still in bearing.\n\nThe only sign of work or prosperity I came across was at\n\n* See the postscript.\nsome tin mines at J\u00e9l\u00e2ndong, which have been worked on a small scale for 17 years by a Sungei Ujong Chinaman.\n\nThe tin deposit at this spot is the richest I have seen, being quite 100 per cent. better than in any mine at present working in Sungei Ujong, but even with this natural advantage the miner's struggle for existence is a very hard one. He is dependent for every mouthful of food upon Pahang or Sungei Ujong, and rice delivered at the mines is costly food indeed. When I was there, a dollar purchased only $2\\frac{3}{4}$ gantangs of rice, as against 7 gantangs in Sungei Ujong, and 10 gantangs at Ku\u00e2la Triang.\n\nAn arrangement has been entered into by which a bridle-track will be constructed from Pantei in Sungei Ujong to these mines early in the coming year, and other roads will be made later on. A shop in connection with the mines will be opened next year, so that I hope that they may progress as they ought to do.\n\nWith regard to the country generally, I see nothing in the way of its prosperity but the absence of population, and people are sure to come in when the proposed roads have become an established fact.\n\nH. A. O'BRIEN.\n\nP. S.\u2014At the present time (September, 1885) the road alluded to above has been completed, and a Collector (Mr. E P. Gueritz) has been appointed, who took up his duties in June last. I understand that the old residents are gradually returning to the country, and that there is every prospect of an early development of the mineral resources of the State.\n\nThe Pahang boundary has been definitely fixed at Sungei Dua on the Triang, and the Collector's quarters, together with a Custom House, Court, and Police Station, have been erected at Ku\u00e2la Klawang.\n\nH. A. O'B.\nOCCASIONAL NOTES.\n\nL\u0100TA.\n\nThe following extract will be of great interest to those who have read Mr. O'Brien's paper on this subject in No. 11 of this Journal.\u2014Ed.\n\n\"The first thing of interest to attract me within a few hours of my arrival at Kosala, was a case in one of the servants of the house of that curious cerebral affection called by the natives lata. It is of a hysterical nature, and is confined chiefly to women, although I have also seen a man affected by it. On being startled, or excited suddenly, the person becomes lata, losing the control of her will, and cannot refrain from imitating whatever she may hear or see done, and will keep calling out, as long as the fit lasts, the name\u2014and generally that word alone\u2014of whatever has flashed through her mind as the cause of it. \"He-ih-heh matjan!\" (tiger); \"He-ih-heh boorung besar!\" (a great bird). Her purpose will be arrested, as, if walking, she will stop short, and on going on again will often follow some other course. The prefatory exclamation is an invariable symptom, seemingly caused by involuntary hysterical inspirations. According to the degree of alarm the symptoms may remain only a few moments, or last for the greater part of a day, especially if the patient be prevented from calming down. The afflicted, if not very seriously affected, are not altogether incapacitated from performing the duties to which they are accustomed. The most curious characteristic of the disease is their imitation of every action they see. On one occasion, while eating a banana, I suddenly met this servant with a piece of soap in her hand: and, perceiving she was slightly lata, but without appearing to take any notice of her, I made a vigorous bite at the fruit in passing her, an action she instantly repeated on the piece of soap. On another\noccasion, while she was looking on as I placed some plants in drying paper, not knowing that caterpillars were objects of supreme abhorrence to the natives, I flicked off in a humorous way on to her dress one that happened to be on a leaf; she was instantly intensely lata, and throwing off all her clothing, she made off like a chased deer along the mountain road, repeating the word for caterpillar as she ran, until compelled by exhaustion to stop, when the spasm gradually left her. My own \"boy,\" who would unconcernedly seize all sorts of snakes in his hands, became one day lata also, on suddenly touching a large caterpillar. My host's maid once, while alone at some distance from the house, having come unexpectedly on a large lizard\u2014the Baiawak\u2014was seized by a paroxysm; dropping down on her hands and knees to imitate the reptile, she thus followed it through mud, water and mire to the tree in which it took refuge, where she was arrested and came to herself. Another case which came under my knowledge was more tragic in its results. This woman, startled by treading in a field on one of the most venomous snakes in Java, became so lata that she vibrated her finger in imitation of the tongue of the reptile in front of its head till the irritated snake struck her; and the poor creature died within an hour.\n\nDuring the attack the eyes have a slightly unnatural stare, but there is never a total loss of consciousness, and throughout the paroxysm the patient is wishful to get away from the object affecting her, yet is without the strength of will to escape, or to cease acting in the way I have described. Lata persons are constantly teased by their fellows, and are often kept in an excited state for whole days.\"\u2014A Naturalist's Wanderings in the Eastern Archipelago.
