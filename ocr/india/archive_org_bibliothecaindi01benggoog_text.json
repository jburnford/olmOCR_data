H. B.\nM. T. B.\nL. S. B.\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST VOLUME.\n\nWhen the Asiatic Society of Bengal did me the honour of inviting me to translate the Akbarn\u0101ma, I replied that I doubted my ability to make a complete translation, and suggested that I might edit the manuscript version by Lieutenant Chalmers. My suggestion was accepted, and I accordingly obtained from the Royal Asiatic Society the loan of the Chalmers' manuscript and permission to print it. I soon found, however, that the translation was too abridged to be made the basis of my work, and that it was necessary to execute a new version. Chalmers' manuscript was of great service to Elphinstone and Count Noer, and it has also been of much use to myself, but there are many gaps in it, and Abul Fa\u1e63l's language has throughout been greatly compressed. One gap near the beginning extends to over ninety pages of the printed text, and has the effect of omitting the account of Akbar's birth, with the prognostics and horoscopes appertaining thereto, as well as the notices of his ancestors from Adam down to his grandfather (B\u0101b\u0101r). The reader may judge of the extent to which abbreviation has been carried, when I state that the Chalmers MS. consists of two thinish volumes of foolscap, and that the Bibliotheca Indica edition of the Persian text occupies three large quartos which aggregate 1,800 pages.\n\nThe task of translation has occupied me several years, and the work has not been very congenial, for Ab\u016bl Fa\u1e63l is not an author for whom one can feel much sympathy or admiration. He was a great flatterer and unhesitatingly suppressed or distorted facts. His style, too, seems\u2014at least to Western eyes\u2014to be quite detestable, being full of circumlocutions, and both turgid and obscure. He is often prolix, and often unduly concise and darkly allusive. His one merit\u2014and it is one which he specially claims for himself\u2014is his laboriousness. He was an unwearied worker, and when we blame him and lament his deficiencies we shall do well to consider what a blank our knowledge of Akbar's reign would have been, had not Ab\u016bl Fa\u1e63l exerted himself during years of strenuous effort to chronicle events and institutions. His work also has the imperishable merit of being a\nrecord by a contemporary, and by one who had access to information at first hand.\n\nI regret that the work of translation has not devolved upon a better Persian scholar than I am. I have endeavoured to do my best, and I have sought assistance in many quarters. I now desire to express my gratitude to my friends, Maulvi Abdul Haq Abid, the late Mr. J. Beames, Mr. A. G. Ellis of the British Museum, Mr. Irvinze and Mr. Whinfield, and to the translation of the Ain-i-Akbari, by Professor Blochmann and Colonel Jarrett, and the works of Major Price. I am also indebted for much literary assistance to my elder brother, Mr. David Beveridge. There are, I am sure, many mistakes in my translation and notes, but there would have been many more but for the assistance of my friends. I regret that I have been obliged to make two long lists of Errata and Addenda. In part this has been due to the translations being made in England and printed in India, and in part to increase of knowledge. The translation of the second volume, which carries on the history of Akbar's reign to the middle of the seventeenth year, has been completed by me, and I am about to begin the translation of the third and last volume. The translation has been made from the Bibliotheca Indica edition of the text, but I have consulted many MSS. in the British Museum, the India Office, and the Royal Asiatic Society's Library, &c. The Bibliotheca Indica edition is by no means so good as it might have been, for the learned native editors* were destitute of geographical or historical knowledge. Hence they have often made mistakes in the names of persons and places. They have also no explanatory notes. In their preface they are severe upon the Lucknow edition. No doubt that edition has many faults, but it was the first in the field, and it is on the whole a creditable monument of the enterprise of the publisher, Munshi Newal Kishor, and of the liberality of the Maharajah of Patiala. The editor, Maulvi Sadiq Ali, also deserves honourable mention. He has added numerous notes, and though many of these are trivial, yet there are also many which are really enlightening.\n\nSince completing the translation, I have seen a remarkable MS. of the first volume of the Akbarnama in the possession of Saiyid Ali\n\n* It is stated in the Persian preface that nine MSS. and the Lucknow lithograph were used in the preparation of the edition. None of the MSS. was of an early date.\nBilgr\u0101mi. This is evidently a rough draft and contains several things which do not occur in the MSS. of the finished work. Among them are one or two letters of Hum\u0101y\u016bn. I have given an account of this MS. in R.A.S.J. for January 1903, p. 115.\n\n4th September, 1902.  \nH. BEVERIDGE.\nErrata and Addenda.\n\n1. P. 3, n. 3. Ahmad 'Ali Kh\u0101n, keeper of the R\u0101mp\u016br Library Rohilkand, showed me a passage in a commentary on Anwari's Odes, which offered an explanation of the phrase, 18,000 worlds. It said that *alf* had the meaning of perfect, or complete, because one thousand was the highest number used in *abjad*, or alphabetical numeration, and that therefore 18,000 meant only 18. This latter number was arrived at by adding together the four worlds, viz., the *'\u0100l\u0101m jabar\u016bt*, *'\u0100l\u0101m malak\u016bt*, *'arsh*, and *kurs\u012b*, the seven heavens, the four elements, and the three *maw\u0101lid*, i.e., the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. The commentary was by Ab\u016bl \u1e24asan Fr\u0101h\u0101n\u012b, and gave as the authority for the statement *'Abdu-r-razz\u0101q K\u0101sh\u012b Sult\u0101n-al-'\u0100rifin's Tawil\u0101t*. The passage occurs at p. 82b, of the R\u0101mp\u016br MS. and is an explanation of a verse where Anwari plays on the two meanings of the word *alf*, viz., 1,000 and also the first letter of the alphabet. It also occurs in B.M. MS., Or. 361 p. 43a Rieu 556b.\n\n2. P. 5, last line. The best translation of the epithet *ist\u012bsq\u0101 bakhy\u0101* seems to be \"answerer of the prayer for rain.\" See Lane 1355b. The reference is to Akbar's alleged miracle of causing rain to fall, and also to his satisfying the thirst of all who wander about, panting after the truth. Blochmann 164.\n\n3. Do., n. 4. See \u0100in text I, 158 where the lover (*'A\u0101shaq*) and the loved (*M\u0101sh\u016bq*) are described as one.\n\n4. P. 6, n. 2. See Tennyson's paraphrase in his \"Akbar's Dream.\"\n\n5. P. 7, n. 2. Several of the lines occur in Faizi's Marka-i-adw\u0101r, B.M. MS., Add. 7795 p. 25, Canto on Speech.\n\n6. Verse, Delete capital in Thy. Niz\u0101m\u012b's lines are addressed to an earthly prince, and A.F. employs them in the same sense.\n\n7. P. 11, n. 3. I.O. MS. 4 has z\u0101.\n\n8. P. 12, l. 6. Perhaps the following is a better translation: \"Rather the aim of praise is to place this vain, self-adorning, self-anctioning, carnal soul on the threshold of submission and the pedestal of supplication and humility, and to cast it out of sight so that\ninward happiness may be graced by outward surrender, and the inner and outer natures may be decked with lowness and be fitted to the modesty of the bosom of purpose and become the praise of the life-giving creator.\u201d\n\n9. P. 12, n. 4. See Faizi\u2019s Nal Daman, last Canto, p. 138 of Newal Kishore\u2019s ed., 1893.\n\n\u201cI drew (or erected) this dome on vision\u2019s arch.\nTo be the glory of the swift-rolling eye.\n\nSee also for use of the phrases khud\u0101r\u0101i and khw\u0101sh\u1e6d\u0101n-gaz\u012bn\u012b, A.F.\u2019s description of the initiation of a novice in the \u201cDivine Faith,\u201d \u0100\u02be\u012bn, text I, 160 and Blochmann 166.\n\n10. P. 16, l. 7. These two epithets occur in the beginning of the \u2018Iy\u0101r d\u0101n\u012bgh.\n\n11. P. 16, n. 1. Maulvi Abdul \u1e24aqq Abid informs me that the meaning here is that Akbar provided food for his people. The phrase \u201cservants of God\u201d means here mankind, or at least all Mu\u1e25ammadans.\n\n12. L. 18. Perhaps the translation, children of Noah, and n. 2 are wrong, for the word in the text is \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0645\u064e and not \u0646\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0645\u064e.\n\n13. P. 20, l. 9. Maulvi A. H. A. informs me that I have missed the point here. The meaning of kh\u016brda-angez is \u201cto find fault with,\u201d and the translation should be \u201chis equity finds defect in the evenness of Farward\u012bn, his courtesy derides the breeze of Ardibihisht,\u201d i.e., his equability surpasses that of Farward\u012bn, and his sweetness smiles superior to the zephyrs of Ardibihisht. See for similar hyperboles the description of Spring in Vol. II, p. 81.\n\n14. P. 21. Notes 3 and 4. R.A.S., MSS., 116 and 117 have tahr\u012br and perhaps this is a preferable reading to taj\u0101bbar. The reference may be to the cancelling of bonds by tearing the top of the document, or to the shrouds with which malefactors provided themselves when suing for mercy.\n\n15. P. 28, four lines from foot. The word in text is harfsar\u0101 fluent, but this does not make good sense. I should be inclined to prefer \u1e25arf\u1e63ard, which is apparently the reading of R.A.S. MSS., Nos. 117 and 119. See Bah\u0101r-i \u2018Ajam-ed, Newal Kishwar 1894\ns.v. \u1e2barfs\u0101r\u0101. \u1e2aarfs\u0101r\u0101 however like the word sakhn-sar\u0101 used later on by A.F., may mean a word-twitterer, i.e., one who indulges in empty verbiage. Maulvi A.H.A. thinks that \u1e2barfs\u0101r\u0101 is right.\n\n16. P. 24, l. 14. Az r\u0101h-i-mij\u0101z m\u012bd\u0101n-id, etc. Read, \"this follower of the truth knows from observation of the outer world.\"\n\nDo. last line. The words \"what strength has Saha,\" etc., ending with the word atom, form a quatrain, and should have been printed as such. The literal translation of the last clause is \"less than an atom.\"\n\n17. P. 25, n. 3. Possibly A.F. was thinking of the Anwar Suhaili. That contains 5 or 6,000 verses and A.F.'s chief mode of abridging it in the \u1e62y\u0101r d\u0101nish is to omit them.\n\n18. P. 26, last line and n. 2. The most correct translation of b'azz-i-mur\u0101d seems to be \"with respect to desires.\" A.F. intimates that he is not ambitious. See also p. 374 of this translation, note 1.\n\n19. P. 27, n. 2. The expression about wearing the cap on the crown of the heart may remind us of the passage in the Anabasis II. 5, where Tissaphernes says to Clearchus that the help of the Greeks will enable him to wear his diadem lightly on his heart. See Grote, 4th ed., VII, 240.\n\n20. P. 29, n. 4, l. 6. For 227 read 247.\n\n21. P. 32, n. 2. Read Shahr\u012bst\u0101n.\n\n22. P. 33, n. 3. For Fard\u016bs read Fird\u016bs. It may be noted here that Giti in Gitisit\u0101n\u012b is pronounced Get\u012b in India, and is so spelt by Blochmann.\n\n23. P. 35, l. 4. Perhaps tam\u012br here means, to cleanse.\n\n24. P. 35, l. 5. Tan-i-W\u0101hid is perhaps explained by A.N., II, 43, where we have the word akh\u0101k\u012bj\u0101n, i.e., possessed by the four elements. It is applied here to ordinary mortals in whom the constituents are not fused together and unified, but are at war with one another.\n\n25. P. 42, second para. According to the Tabaq\u0101t\u012b Akbar\u012b, end of account of the 23rd year, the dream occurred on the night of the birth. Lucknow ed. 339. '\u0100rif Qandah\u0101r\u012b says it occurred on 4 Rabi'-al-awwal 947.\n\n26. P. 45, last line and n. 5. Perhaps \u1e25arf-i-nam\u016bd\u0101r darmy\u0101n b\u016bd merely means that the subject of the nam\u016bd\u0101r was under\ndiscussion. Cf. text 162, l. 5, where \u1e25arf-i-rukhsat darmiy\u0101n award means he introduced the subject of leave.\n\n27. P. 53, m. 1. For 43c read 43a. In the same note for pistadin read pistachio, and spot for South, do for Hajr\u012b read Hijr\u0101 and add, Hijr\u012b was the takhalla\u1e63 of a poet. See Bud\u0101\u016bn\u012b III, 386 and Tabaq\u0101t Akbar\u012b, Lucknow ed. 401. He was long in the service of M. Hind\u0101l and was descended from Ahmad J\u0101m, and so would be a relative of \u1e24amida. His div\u0101n is in the A.S.B. library, Cat. p. 117, and also in the I.O. library, Eth\u00e9 No. 1441 of p. 793. It contains odes in praise of Akbar and a chronogram for Humay\u016bn\u2019s death, but I could not find any interesting historical allusion in the poems, or any reference to \u1e24amida.\n\n28. P. 53, n. I think it clear that A.F. means that K. Mu\u2019azzam was only the half-brother of \u1e24amida. At p. 55 he uses the word a\u2019y\u0101ni to denote a full-brother.\n\n29. P. 54, n. 2, last sentence. For Procyon read Sirius, and delete the last four words. The epithet applied to Procyon is ghamiza, the obscure (?)\n\n30. P. 55. According to local tradition, Akbar was born in the fields about a mile outside of the fort. See a paper by N. V. Mandlik read 8th March, 1855, and published in his writings and speeches, Bombay, 1896, p. 199, and also the Calcutta Review for January 1900. Possibly the old fort stood where the Akbar memorial now stands, for V. N. Mandlik says that the old fort was destroyed and a new one built by Nur Mu\u1e25ammad Kulhara in 1746.\n\n31. P. 58, second line. Though j\u0101s means a peacock it also means a handsome man or woman and the root is j\u0101s, beautiful. A.F. applies the term to R\u016bpmat\u012b II, 137. It seems to have been a title in use among the Afghans. See the story of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s reception by Selim Sh\u0101h in Bud\u0101\u016bn\u012b (Ranking), and see also B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs where T\u0101\u016bs Kh\u0101n is given as the name of an Afghan chief.\n\n32. P. 58, verse third, last line. The correct translation appears to be: \u201cEasily carried away the hearts of lovers of the difficult,\u201d meaning, I presume, the critical and not easily pleased.\n\n33. P. 62 near foot. For \u201crouse\u201d read \u201croused.\u201d\n\n34. P. 66, n. Yes; All\u0101h has properly three ls, so that 66 is right.\n\n35. P. 66, n. 1. For 3436 read 343b.\n36. P. 66, n. 2. For Ja\u015bar \u0160adiq read J\u0101\u015bafar \u0160adiq.\n\n37. P. 69, n. 2. For Ta\u0161hilat read Tasahilat. It means, simplifications, or easy lessons.\n\n38. P. 78, n. 1, col. 2, line 11th. For 711 read \u201c7 lines.\u201d\n\n39. P. 77, n. 2. Alcochoden is evidently the same word as Kadkhud\u0101 with the article prefixed.\n\n40. P. 82, n. My remark about the Canon Masudicus is, I believe, erroneous. From Rehats\u00e9k\u2019s description it would seem that there is no astrology in the work. The copy in the Mulla Fir\u016bz library is in good condition, and very legible. There is also a copy in the Nawab of R\u0101mp\u016br\u2019s library.\n\n41. P. 83, n. In last para. delete the repetition of the words \u201cet ex hoc adorogen,\u201d and substitute \u201cdorongen.\u201d In last sentence of same paragraph read \u201cA difficulty arises.\u201d\n\n42. P. 91. For Carden read Cardan.\n\n43. P. 92, l. 1. It seems probable that 22 was regarded as a mystic number from its being that of the letters of the Hebrew, Syriac, and, presumably, of the ancient Arabic alphabets.\n\n44. End of last para. Substitute the translation \u201cAlas! I have no brother to rise high in my service,\u201d delete note 4 and substitute \u201c\u0625\u0650\u0631\u0652\u0632\u064e\u0648\u064f\u201d is here used in the sense of regret.\u201d\n\n45. P. 96, n. 1. Delete comma after Sh\u012braz. In this note I have mixed up two distinct princes. The Buyide \u2018Azad-ad-daula ruled in Bagdad. Alp Arsl\u0101n whom Col. Jarrett calls \u2018Azad-ad-daula belongs to the 12th century. Fat\u1e25ulla whom Bud\u0101\u016bni calls Sh\u0101h Fat\u1e25ulla came to Akbar\u2019s court in 990 A.H. See Bud\u0101\u016bni, Lowe, 326. There is a long account of him, taken chiefly from Bud\u0101\u016bni, on the Darb\u0101r Akbari of Az\u0101d.\n\n46. P. 111, n. 3. Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s death and Akbar\u2019s accession occurred when the sun was in Gemini. Can h\u0101\u0161tam-chaharam mean the 32nd degree? B.M. M.P. Add. 27, 247 has h\u0101\u0161tam dar chaharam, i.e., 8 by 4. In the B\u0101dsh\u0101hnam\u0101 Bib. Ind. I, 66, Akbar is said to have been born when the sun was in Scorpio. I think now that the proper translation is \u201cAs the 8th and 4th Houses are Gemini with respect to the degrees.\u201d\n\n47. P. 112, l. 18. Delete comma after Mars, and insert one after Jupiter.\nP. 117, second para. For \"copied in sketch\" read \"exactly copied.\"\n\nP. 117, n. 3. The word occurs again in A.N. II, p. 11, l. 16.\n\nP. 123. The account of Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn's dancing seems to be taken from the T\u00e2r\u00eekh Alf\u00ee, though there the circumstance is said to have only occurred once. The passage occurs in the description of the events of 949 A.H. and at page 572a of B.M. MS.

P. 130, five lines from foot. D\u00e2ya Bh\u00e2wal means the nurse Bh\u00e2wal, and the word d\u00e2ya is used immediately before with reference to Jiji. D\u00e2ya Bh\u00e2wal is evidently the same person as Bh\u00e2wal Anaga who is mentioned soon afterwards, and A.F.'s meaning is that though there is a statement that Bh\u00e2wal was the first nurse, the ascertained fact is (ta\u1e63aqiq \u0101nast) that Akbar was first of all suckled by his mother, then by Fakhr-i-nis\u00e2, then by Bh\u00e2wal. Bh\u00e2wal or Beh\u00e2wal is probably a form of the Persian word bah\u00e2war precious and which is sometimes spelt bah\u00e2l\u00fb. Presumably A.F. by speaking of her as a special servant, khidmatg\u00e2r-i-kh\u00e2s of Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn, means that she was one of his concubines, and of course she must have been a mother. Possibly she was M\u00e2ham Anaga. M\u00e2ham, as I have stated elsewhere, means \"my Moon\" and is a common appellation of women. The author of the Darb\u00e2ri Akbar\u00ee, p. 749, makes the curious statement that Bh\u00e2wal Anaga was the daughter of one Jog\u00e2 Barh\u00e2r,* and that she was introduced into the harem of Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn by his father B\u00e2b\u00e2r. There her attractive face and manners captivated Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn, but her star paled before the sun of Miriam-Makini's presence, and the king made her over to Jal\u00e2l Koka (?). Still she remained in the harem, and became one of Akbar's nurses. No authority is given for these statements, and I do not know where the author found them. It\n\n* Qu. Parih\u00e2r?\nlooks as if he meant to identify her with Maham Anaga, and to represent the latter as a Hindu. This view might coincide with Bud\u0101\u016bi\u2019s remark that Akbar was from his earliest years associated with low Hindus. I cannot find the tribe or caste Barh\u0101r either in Crooke, or Sherring, though there are some names nearly approaching to it, and I was told in Upper India that there was such a caste. A.F. mentions (A.N. II, 210, top line), the caste Parih\u0101r in describing Gondw\u0101na. He also mentions there one Jog\u012b D\u0101s a younger brother of Sangram S\u0101. The Parih\u0101rs were Rajputs and were rulers of Bandelkhand before the Candels, Sleeman\u2019s Rambles ed. 1893, I, 175 note. It is possible that the Jal\u0101l Koka of the Darb\u0101ri Akbar may be another name for Nadim Koka, and that the facts stated there may be a solution of the mystery of Adham Kh\u0101n\u2019s parentage. There certainly is, as Elliot remarks, a mystery about the paternity of Adham Kh\u0101n and it may be that though his mother was married to Nadim Koka, Hum\u0101y\u016bn was his father.\n\n49. P. 132, last line. Maulvi Abdul Haq Abid informs me that the meaning of the words s\u0101kin\u0101n-i-maj\u0101ma-i-uns is \u201cthe dwellers of the gathering places of Divine love, or, the members of the congregations of Divine love,\u201d i.e., the angels.\n\n50. P. 134. In an article in the R.A.S.J., for January 1889, p. 99, I endeavoured to show that Maham Anaga was the wife of Nadim Kokalt\u0101sh. The mention of his name at p. 135 as one of those left at \u2018Um\u0101rkot in charge of Miriam-Mak\u0101n\u012b perhaps supports this view. It appears from a note by Garcin de Tassy at p. 11 of his abridged translation of Syed Ahmad\u2019s book on the Delhi monuments, Paris, 1861, that the author of Colonel Hama\u2019s MS., noticed in the article above referred to, was probably M\u012brz\u0101 Hidayat Ullah for it is stated by Garcin de Tassy that Hidayat Ullah was a grandson of M\u012brz\u0101 Koka and wrote a T\u0101r\u012bkh or chronicle in 1070 A.H. or 1659. See also p. 129. Hidayat Ullah\u2019s chronicle is not in the B.M. or I.O., and I have been unable to find out where it is, for Garcin de Tassy does not tell us and there is no reference to the MS. in Syed Ahmad\u2019s book. Hidayat Ullah\u2019s name occurs in Beale\u2019s Oriental Biographies. See below p. 475, n. 3. To the remark about Adham Kh\u0101n\u2019s age at end of note in p. 134 it may be added that A.F. describes Adham as taking a prominent part in the beginning of the seige of M\u0101nkot. He could hardly have done\nthis if he had been no older than Akbar who was then only fourteen.\n\n51. P. 139, last lines. The late Mr. Rodgers states, R.A.S.J. for 1898, p. 729, that this chronogram is by Fai\u1e63\u012b, but this seems to be a mistake. A.F. does not ascribe it to his brother, and the latter was not born till some years after Akbar's birth.\n\n52. P. 154, n. 3. Probably this is the correct translation. A.F. means apparently that previous works, though voluminous, have not treated the subject in a satisfactory manner.\n\n53. P. 166, n. 8. For \u0130fan read Ifin.\n\n54. P. 180, last sentence. The expression dar parda \u0101r\u016b receives elucidation from its recurrence in text I, 347, top line. This, I think, disposes of the suggestion inserted by Dr. Bloch in a note at the end of this fasciculus. See also II, 42 of text, l. 10 and do., l. 10. By the expression, remaining behind the veil, A.F. not only means the period before Akbar's birth, but also the time before he revealed himself to the world. Cf. Blochmann, p. 124, n. 1 and p. 13, line 12.\n\n55. P. 182, verse. These lines occur in Sharafu-d-din's preface to the Zafarn\u0101ma, i.e., in his T\u0101rikh Jah\u0101ng\u012br.\n\n56. P. 201, n. 2. There is a mistake in this note. The Prolegomena says ten, but only gives five names.\n\n57. P. 204, l. 10. Read Shahnigh\u0101n\u012b.\n\n58. P. 217, n. 2. Gauhar Sh\u0101d's death is described in the Ma\u1e6dla' Sa\u02bf\u0101dain, and the date given is 9 Ramz\u0101n. S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101 in his anthology R.M. MS. Add. 7670, p. 46b, says Qatalu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Du\u0101n\u012b was the author of the chronogram. He gives the quatrain.\n\n59. P. 218, l. 14. For \"gave\" read \"give.\"\n\n60. P. 222, l. 6. For \"then\" read \"these.\"\n\n61. Do. Shahrban\u016b's name is also omitted in Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b's text, and in the Alwar MS. only four daughters are mentioned. Shahrban\u016b apparently means the Moon-lady. For \"B\u0101bar's,\" p. 222, n. 1, read \"'Umar Shaikh's.\"\n\n62. P. 223, beginning of chapter, and n. 2. For \"king of the four quarters and of the seven heavens\" read king of the throne of the seven worlds.\" The word cah\u0101r is often used, as Quatrem\u00e8re has shown in his notes to the Ma\u1e6dla' Sa\u02bf\u0101dain without really meaning four. Cah\u0101r b\u0101l\u012bk really only means the pillows of the d\u012bv\u0101n,\nor the div\u0101n itself. By the haft manzar is meant here probably the seven climes, or the seven heavens, or the seven planets. It is however worthy of notice that the Qu\u1e6db of Delhi was known as the Min\u0101sa-i-haft manzar, i.e., the minaret of seven stories. See Gar\u00e7in de Tassy\u2019s translation of Syed \u2018Ahmad\u2019s work on Delhi, Paris 1861, p. 86. As Delhi was B\u0101bar\u2019s capital, it is possible that here A.F. is alluding to the Qu\u1e6db.\n\n63. P. 223, n. 4. For J\u0101n\u012b read J\u0101m\u012b.\n\n64. P. 228, two lines from foot. Text and MSS. have Bekt\u016bb. Erskine, 170, has Bektob.\n\n65. P. 232, n. last sentence, read Kh\u0101las\u0101id. It means \u201cfull aunt.\u201d B\u0101bar in the account of his father\u2019s children speaks of one daughter as being hamshiraz\u0101id, i.e., full sister, of N\u0101\u1e63ir.\n\n66. P. 233, line 18. Before 917 read \u201cin the month of Rajab.\u201d\n\n67. P. 234, top line and n. 1. Usually called Najm \u0160\u0101n\u012b from his having succeeded Najm Zargar Gil\u0101n\u012b. His real name was Y\u0101r Ahmad Ispah\u0101n\u012b. The Haft Iqlim I.O. copy 329b says he was put to death by Ubaid Ullah on 3 Ramz\u0101n 918. These occurrences are detailed in the T. Alfi B.M. MS., Or. 465, 514b and also in the \u1e24abibu-s-siyar, and in the lives of Ism\u0101il and Tahm\u0101sp by Khw\u0101ndam\u012br\u2019s son Mahm\u016bd, as well as in the anonymous author of the life of Ism\u0101il, B.M. MSS., Or. 2939 and 3248. A.F. is correct in saying that B\u0101bar had at first won the victory; Ubaid Ullah lay in ambush and turned the victory into a defeat. The victories which B\u0101bar previously gained occurred near \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r and were won against Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s sons \u1e24amza and Mahdi Sult\u0101ns. See Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019 letter B.M. MS., Or. 3482 68b where a list of his children is given.\n\n68. Do., n. 1. In the anonymous life of Ism\u0101il, p. 215a, it is stated that one ward of Karshi was exclusively occupied by Caghatais, and that they begged for B\u0101bar\u2019s protection. He interceded for them with Najm \u0160\u0101n\u012b, but it was in vain. On the day of the battle Najm \u0160\u0101n\u012b put R\u0101bar in the reserve. When B\u0101bar saw that the battle was lost he fled to \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r.\n\n69. P. 238, n. 5, for \u201ctaken\u201d read \u201ctaker.\u201d The derivation here given seems correct, and is supported by Gulbadan Begam\u2019s Memoirs, p. 8c, where Qasim Beg is described as writing to B\u0101bar that a new prince had been born, and suggesting that his name should be\nmade a prognostic of the conquest of India, ba shag\u0113n fath-i-Hind u tal\u0101h alimash. The last word is Turki and means \"taking.\" In consequence of this letter B\u0101bar called his son Hind\u0101l.\n\n70. P. 241, top line. Read Biban.\n\n71. Do., n. 3. A.F. is evidently copying Shaikh Zain here. He has B.M. MS., Or. 1999, 51b, \"ba zinjir u kh\u0101m-i-g\u0101o.\"\n\n72. P. 243, n. 1. See Shaikh Zain 88a. The page is misplaced in MS. and should come after 57b.\n\n73. Do., l. 14. For t\u016blgh\u0101ma read t\u016blagma.\n\n74. P. 244, n. 5. Possibly B\u0101bar does not name Taimur because he was not a b\u0101dgh\u0101h, but only an Am\u012br. But most likely it is because Taimur did not acquire the sovereignty of Hindustan. He merely plundered the country and returned. A.F. reckons Taimur; for at p. 245 he calls B\u0101bar the fourth conqueror.\n\n75. P. 244. The comparison with Taimur's forces is taken from Shaikh Zain, B.M. MS., pp. 53b and 55a. Zain has naukar-turk Turkish servants instead of naukar-i-naukar. He also gives 18,000 as the number of horses who can occupy a farsang though he reckons Taimur's total force at 72,000.\n\n76. P. 246, note 278. More probably the reference is to the battle of P\u0101n\u012bpat with Hem\u016b though Akbar had little personal share in the victory. Instead of \"many rebellious chiefs\" read \"so many refractory chiefs.\"\n\n77. P. 247, n. 4. Zain l.c., pp. 63c and b says Alauddin brought a diamond to India. M\u016btamed Kh\u0101n says in the Iqb\u0101ln\u0101ma that Alau-d-din got diamond from Vikram\u0101ditya. In this he is merely copying A.F. My opinion now is that it is not certain that B\u0101bar means that his son got the diamond from Vikram\u0101ditya's heirs. His language is vague and perhaps all he means is that the diamond was one of the things that Hum\u0101y\u016bn got when he was investing the fort. At any rate B\u0101bar's account is not that of an eyewitness. Zain makes Hum\u0101y\u016bn the spokesman to his father. He says the diamond was reckoned worth 2\u00bd days of the world's income. The word in Add. 27, 247 is \u062e\u0631\u0627\u062c and I am sure that income is a better translation than expenditure.\n\n78. P. 248, beginning of para. Zain has Tuesday the 29th.\n\n79. P. 249, n. In Persian quotation read in second line \u0633\u06a9 \u0648 \u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\u06a9 in third \u062e\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0646 and in fourth line first word \u0648\u0627\u0639\ninstead of \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 and also \u062f\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0647\u0650 for \u062f\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0647\u0650 and \u0641\u064e\u0631\u0650\u062f\u0652 for \u0641\u064e\u0631\u0650\u062f\u0652 to complete the sentence should be added \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627.\n\n80. P. 257, last para. and n. 4. Shaikh Zain, p. 98b, says that Ibrahim's mother was sent to Kabul and the T\u0101r\u012bkh Mahmadi B.M. Or. 1824, p. 57a says that on the road the lady flung herself into the Indus and drowned herself. The author gives as his authority for this statement the Iqb\u0101ln\u0101ma of M\u016btamed Kh\u0101n, and I have verified the reference. It also appears from the Iqb\u0101ln\u0101ma that the lady's name was Bava \u0628\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0627. But this was only a sobriquet, and perhaps was the name by which B\u0101bar called her. It means in Hindi, sister and paternal aunt.\n\n81. P. 264, verse. For cap read veil.\n\n82. 266, n. 5. It appears from B\u0101bar's Memoirs, Erskine 274, that Kh\u0101n Mirz\u0101 was alive on 4th September, 1519, or Rama\u1e63\u0101n 925, for the J\u0101n N\u0101sir there mentioned as coming from his government seems a clerical error for Kh\u0101n Mirz\u0101n; O, p. 272, we see that Kipak had been sent to him, and presumably this was to summon him to his presence.\n\n83. P. 272, n. 2. Insert comma after him, and delete comma after \u1e24aidar.\n\n84. P. 273, n. 1. Probably Alwar is correct. The child probably was born at Alwar which was his brother Hind\u0101l's appanage afterwards, and received his name from the place.\n\n85. P. 277, near foot. Read \"He bade adieu to this faithless world on 6 Jam\u0101da-ul-awwal 937 in a garden (c\u0101rb\u0101gh) in Agra, on the banks of the Jamna, which that springtide of fortune had made verdant.\"\n\nAdd. note 2a. The local tradition is that B\u0101bar was temporarily buried in the R\u0101mb\u0101gh (originally perhaps \u0100r\u0101mb\u0101gh) on the left or east side of the river, about two miles above the railway bridge. Mr. Keene says in his guide to Agra, p. 1, that according to the Akbarn\u0101ma B\u0101bar was buried in the C\u0101rb\u0101gh some miles lower down the river and nearly opposite the T\u0101j. But the Akbarn\u0101ma says nothing about where the body was buried, and A.F.'s words are that the death occurred in a C\u0101rb\u0101gh. Any laid out garden is called a C\u0101rb\u0101gh, meaning perhaps that it is rectangular, or divided into\n\n1 R\u0101m may however be the original form. R\u0101m is an abbreviation of \u0100r\u0101m and here has nothing to do with R\u0101m the Indian hero. See Hyde, p. 263 and Steingass s.v. r\u0101m.\nsquares by paths. B\u0101bar\u2019s body remained in the garden for several years, and perhaps would never have been removed if Hum\u0101y\u016bn had not been driven out of India. B\u0101bar tells us that the east bank of the Jamna was called K\u0101bul by the Indians in allusion to its gardens. Perhaps this gave rise to the story that B\u0101bar desired to be buried in K\u0101bul, or it may be that his son satisfied his conscience by thinking that his father\u2019s body was deposited in a place known as K\u0101bul. At all events it seems to have lain there till after the battle of Kanauj and the consequent flight from India when B\u0101bar\u2019s widow B\u012bka Begam performed the pious duty of removing it to K\u0101bul. See the story in Jauhar (Persian text) and in Erskine\u2019s History II, 325 n. It is clear from Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s reference to B\u012bka Begam in the Tuzuk, p. 51, lith. ed., that she was B\u0101bar\u2019s widow and that consequently it was not B\u0101bar\u2019s daughter M\u2019as\u016bma, or Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s wife H\u0101ji Begam who removed the bones.\n\nThere does not appear to be now any trace of the grave in the R\u0101m B\u0101gh, as the Carb\u0101gh is now called. The garden seems also to have been known as the Gul-afsh\u0101n. There is a long account of the making of the Carb\u0101gh in B\u0101bar, Erskine 341, and also in Shaikh Z\u0101in\u2019s T\u0101rikh B\u0101b\u0101r\u012b B.M., Or. 1999, p. 83b. It was on the east side of the Jamna, and opposite the fort. S. Z\u0101in calls it Carb\u0101gh-i-hasht bihi\u0161t, a name which also occurs in B\u0101bar. S. Z\u0101in gives a poem about the garden, ending in the chronogram \ufeda\ufee8\ufe92\ufef4\ufeea \ufe8e\ufee0\ufef4\ufe8e. These three words Kh\u0101na k\u0101aba \u0101f\u0101q, i.e., house of the Kaaba of the horizons yield 935.\n\n86. Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn calls Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja \u201cd\u0101m\u0101d,\u201d but \u201cd\u0101m\u0101d\u201d means husband of the king\u2019s sister and husband in general as well as son-in-law. Gulbadan Begam, who is a better authority on the point, calls Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja izna, i.e., brother-in-law (it may also mean son-in-law) of B\u0101bar. In the Habib-as-siyar B.M., MS. Add. 16,679, p. 370a, line 16, it is stated that Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja was the husband of B\u0101bar\u2019s elder sister Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam. The entry refers to the year 922. In the Bombay lithograph and in B.M. Add. 17,925 the name Kh\u0101nz\u0101da is not given but it is stated that Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja was married to two sisters of B\u0101bar, that he was the son of M\u016bsa and grandson of M\u012br Murtaga, and that on the mother\u2019s side he was descended from Abul Khair Kh\u0101n (Shaib\u0101ni\u2019s grandfather). In the Maj\u0101lis Nafais of \u2018Ali Sher, a Khw\u0101ja M\u016bs\u0101 is described as a rich man who bought\nverses from poor poets and passed them off as his own. Apparently [br\u0101h\u012bm Qan\u016bn\u012b a famous musician who is also mentioned in the Majalis as well as in S\u0101m M. Tahfat B.M. MS. 7671, p. 64b was a son of Khw\u0101ja M\u016bs\u0101.\n\n87. P. 278, Cf. A.N. III, 580. The 34th year corresponds to 997-998 A.H. or 1588-89. The Memoirs were partially translated before this, first by Sh\u0101ikh Zain, and second by Payanda \u1e24asan Ghaznav\u012b and Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Moghal in 994 et seq., i.e., 1585. It also seems to me from a MS. in the Alwar Palace-library that the so-called \u2018Abdurra\u1e25\u012bm\u2019s translation existed in Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s time. See Asiatic Quarterly Review for July and October 1900.\n\n87a. Do., n. 2. For Tempel read Tenfel.\n\n88. P. 279, Verse. This quatrain is given in a Persian MS. of the Shaw collection in the Indian Institute, Oxford, No. 309 and called the J\u0101m\u2019a-al-muq\u0101mat, \u201ccollection of assemblies.\u201d The circumstances under which Babar came to compose it are also given there. We are told that he won the victory over R\u0101n\u0101 Sanga owing to the mysterious aid of Maul\u0101na Khw\u0101jag\u0101 Ahmad, otherwise known as Maqd\u016bm \u2018\u0100z\u012bm. So he sent Darvesh Mu\u1e25ammad S\u0101rb\u0101n to him at D\u0101hb\u0101d near Samarkand with presents and this verse. The saint is said in return to have written part of the Ris\u0101la-B\u0101bar\u012b. (B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs?)\n\n89. P. 280. Mr. Blochmann has given a translation of this passage at p. 220 of the Proceedings A.S.B. for 1874. There are several mistakes in my rendering. For the account of Sh\u0101ikh Zain this should be substituted. \u201cSh\u0101ikh Zain Sadr, great-grandson of (ba do w\u0101sta, two removes) Sh\u0101ikh Zainu-d-d\u012bn Khw\u0101fi. He had acquired a knowledge of science, was of quick parts and was skilled in poetry and the art of letter-writing. He was distinguished by his long association with His Majesty, and became an Am\u012br in the time of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jinnat-\u0100shiy\u0101n\u012b.\u201d See at p. 219 l.c., the inscription on S. Zain\u2019s mosque at Kachparwa.\n\n90. Do., line 12. For \u201cpaternal\u201d read \u201cmaternal.\u201d\n\n91. Do., F\u0101r\u012bgh\u012b. For an account of him and specimens of his poetry see Bud\u0101\u016bn\u012b, Ranking 616. Bud\u0101\u016bn\u012b says that he and his nephew died in the same year (940 A.H.)\n\n92. P. 281. Mr. Blochmann has \u201csurkh wid\u0101i kuhnah, a little-known poet.\u201d The word which I have rendered \u201cinartificial\u201d is\nbe-ta'yin, and should be rendered \"obscure.\" He is mentioned in 'Ali Sher's Maj\u0101lis, p. 41a, of Persian translation.\n\n93. Do., l. 6. Insert indefinite article before masnavi.\n\n94. P. 285, n. 2. M\u0101ham most probably means \"My moon.\" It was apparently a common appellation for women. Cf. M\u0101ham Anaga, and the name of Taimur's wife. See Schuyler's Turkistan II. 97, ed. 1876, where we are told that a beautiful lady who was executed at Bokh\u0101ra was commonly known as \"My moon of Kenin ghaz.\" Cf. the proper names Nuram, and Sh\u0101ikh\u0101m, i.e., My light and my Sh\u0101ikh. If Maham be regarded as a Turki word it should from the law of the sequence of vowels be spelt M\u0101him as in P. de Courteille.\n\n94a. The fullest accounts of this worthless character, M. Zam\u0101n, M\u012brz\u0101 are to be found in B.M. MSS., Or. 2939 and 3248. He was married to B\u0101bar's daughter in Kabul in 921 or 922, and a few months afterwards his father-in-law sent him back to Balkh as governor. He was not a success there, and could not resist the Uzbegs. In 934 B\u0101bar summoned him to India and settled a large estate upon. He ended his days by being drowned at Causa.\n\n95. Do. According to the Mir\u0101t Sikandari four letters passed between Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Bah\u0101dur; verse I, p. 293, belongs to Hum\u0101y\u016bn's first letter, and verse II to the second, viz., that which was written on receipt of Bah\u0101dur's first reply. The M. Sikandari Bombay lithograph 237 gives Hum\u0101y\u016bn's second letter, and at 235 Bah\u0101dur's reply. The latter is very insolent in tone and it is no wonder that it offended Hum\u0101y\u016bn. It blames him for his treatment of M. Zam\u0101n and taunts him with boasting of the deeds of his seventh ancestor (Taimur) while having nothing of his own to show. It winds up with a verse to this effect. The translation in Bayley's Gujrat, p. 374, is very erroneous. A translation of the M. Sikandari has lately been published at Bombay by Fa\u1e63l Ullah. The correspondence will also be found in B.M.'s MS., Or. 3482, pp. 104-106. I do not think Bay\u0101zid was M. Zam\u0101n's custodian. More probably he was his fellow-prisoner.\n\n96. P. 295, Verse. See also T. Alfi, p. 115, of B.M., Or. 465. The second couplet is from H\u0101fi\u1e93, Brockhans, p. 141, Ode 220.\n\n97. P. 296, 2nd line. The figure 1 is misplaced. It refers to \"weak head\" on top line.\n\n98. P. 297, n. 4. In a letter to Erskine, Mountstuart Elphinstone,\nsee his life by Colebrooke, comments on what appears to be B\u0101bar's suppression of facts about the Prince of Hind, whose name he seems to have used. I presume Elphinstone refers to Al\u0101uddin whom B\u0101bar used as a tool.\n\n99. P. 298, n. second col. For 960 read 96 n.\n\n100. P. 302, n. 1. There were at least three R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101ns, viz., 1ts. The man whom the Portuguese called Khw\u0101ja Sofar, who built the fort of Surat, and whose head was carried off by a cannon ball at the second siege of Diu in June 1546. 2nd. His son whom the T\u0101r\u012bkh Mu\u1e25ammadi calls Khw\u0101ja Maham, who was killed in the same siege, just at its close in November 1546. See Tevius, p. 441. 3rd. R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n, Bah\u0101dur's artillery-officer who deserted to Hum\u0101y\u016bn and was poisoned after the taking of Cun\u0101r. Some information regarding R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n the artillerist and Khw\u0101ja Safar will be found in the Barq-al-Yam\u0101n of Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn of which De Sa\u00e7y has given an abstract in N. et E. IV. It appears from it that R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n the artillerist's real name was Mastafa Beg and that he was the son of Bairam and nephew of Sulaim\u0101n. He came to India in the Turkish fleet commanded by his uncle in 936. Khw\u0101ja Safar came at the same time and both were well received by Bah\u0101dur, Mastafa getting the title of R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n and the governorship of Diu, and Safar being made governor of Surat. The story of R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n's being poisoned is confirmed by Qu\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn. Erskine, Hist. II, 82 n., says that the first R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n is buried at Surat, and Tevius, p. 385, of his commentaries, seems to say that his obsequies were celebrated at Diu. \u2018Arif Qandah\u0101r\u012b gives the verses in which the chronogram of the building of Surat fort occur, see Blochmann 354, and says they were written by A\u1e25mad Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b known as Ra\u1e93\u0101i. The name of the builder of the fort is given in the verses as Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100\u1e93\u012bm Kh\u0101n Khudawand Kh\u0101n.\n\n101. P. 306, n. 2. Dele d\u012bn.\n\n102. P. 307, three lines from foot. Read \u201cAghazw\u0101r,\u201d (like Aghaz or Oghuz'). He was Governor of Herat and also At\u0101liq.\n\n103. P. 309, three lines from foot. Read \u201cGawars.\u201d\n\n104. P. 314, 11 lines from foot. For \u201cwrong\u201d read \u201cstrong.\u201d\n\n105. Do., n. 1. The page reference is wrong.\n\n106. Do., n. 2. For Monday read Tuesday.\n\n107. P. 316, n. 3. After Nari\u0101d insert \u201cand A\u1e25mad\u0101bad.\u201d\n108. P. 317, second line and n. 1. We are told in the M. Sikandari that Humayun called him a \"black slave\" Ghulam-i-siak. Imad-ul-Mulk is stated, Bayley's Gujrat p. 400, to have been the son of Tawakkal chief of the royal Khassah Khailan. He was put to death at Surat by Khudawand Khan Rumi in 1545, l.c., 435 and 436.\n\n109. Do., second last para. For Nansari read Nasiri.\n\n110. P. 321, n. 1. Ferishta calls it Ghata Karci and an article by Mohan Lal Vishnu Lal Pandia in J.A.S.B. for 1897, p. 167, states that Ghata Karci is the name of a town close to the town of Banswara.\n\n111. P. 323, 13th line for \"reporting\" read \"repenting.\"\n\n112. P. 323, n. 3. Sofar or Sofarus of the Portuguese, probably the epithet refers to Rumi Khan's complexion as the word means the pale or yellow. Sofar however is a proper name and may have been Rumi Khan's real name or it may have been given to him on account of his Greek origin, for the Greeks are called the sons of Asfar (the superlative of safar. Lane 1699b). According to Damian Goes, who calls him Khwaja Coffarus, he was born of a Turkish mother and a Christian father in the island of Chios. See Damian's Diensis Oppugnatio, Cologne 1602, published by Birckmann, p. 279.\n\n113. P. 829, n. 2. This genealogy is also given in A.N. II, 64. I am inclined to think that Nuruddin first married Gul-barg, a daughter of Babar not named by Gulbadan, and had by her Selima, and that then in Humayun's reign, and probably after the death of her first husband Iqbal Taimur, he married Gulrang. It is Pash, not Pash Begum. Nuruddin belonged to the Naqshbandi order.\n\n114. P. 331, second para. Cf. Jarrett II, 122, where it is said that the Bengalis make boats so high that when attached to the shore they overtop the walls of a fort. Rumi Khan then seems to have adopted a Bengali stratagem.\n\n115. P. 388, n. 2. Beale, O.B.D., p. 265, of ed. 1894, says that Shaikh Phul or Bahlul's tomb is on a hill near the fort of Biaina. Mahommed Bakhshi is said to have buried him there. The brothers were descended from Fariduddin-Attar, and their father's name was Qiyamu-d-din, and he is buried at Ghazipur.\n\n116. P. 341, n. 2, l. 3. For \"East\" read \"West.\" Narhan is probably correct for Bayazid, 148b, speaks of Narhan as a ferry near Tajpur where Khwajah Zechariah and others had a Jagir.\nThere is a pargana T\u0101jp\u016br mentioned in the \u0100in Jarrett II. 130 as in Sark\u0101r T\u0101ndha. Of course this is not the Darbhanga T\u0101jp\u016br.\n\n117. P. 944, 5 lines from foot. Dele the word \"learned\" within brackets.\n\n118. Do. n. 2. For \u0160ihna read \u0160ahna.\n\n118a. Do. n. 4. For Roebach read Roebuck.\n\n119. P. 352, seven lines from foot. For abr\u016by\u0101n read beabr\u016by\u0101n.\n\n120. P. 357, n. l. A S\u0101rang Kh\u0101n is mentioned in Taimu's Institutes, Davy and White, as a brother of Matu Kh\u0101n and as ruling in the country of Multan.\n\n121. P. 360. There is an obscurity about \u1e24am\u012bda B\u0101nu's parentage. In B.M. M.S. Add. 7688, which is a collection of letters, there are three addressed by Naw\u0101b Bilq\u012bs Mak\u0101n\u012b Miriam Beg to her mother and sister. They also appear in the similar collection, Or. 3842, 147b. Apparently the writer is \u1e24am\u012bda Ban\u016b, for they belong to her time, viz., the reign of Tahm\u0101sp, and they are such as she might write in a foreign country. They also immediately follow the correspondence of her husband, Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Bilq\u012bs Mak\u0101n\u012b is a name given to \u1e24am\u012bda in the T. Sindh, and Miriam Beg may be Miriam Mak\u0101n\u012b. In the first letter the writer calls her mother Sul\u1e6d\u0101nam and begs her good offices for one \u1e62afi Kh\u0101n, whom she describes as being the son of her lala or guardian. The second is to her sister, Zainab Begam, and is to the same effect. The third is to her mother and consists of inquiries after her health. It is forwarded by one Khw\u0101ja Risw\u0101n who had come to explain his offences. The compiler of the book describes these letters as addressed to the writer's own mother and sister, and if so, we learn that her mother was called Sul\u1e6d\u0101nam and her sister Zainab. But possibly they are addressed to ladies of Tahm\u0101sp's family whom she may have adopted as her mother and sister. \u1e62afi Kh\u0101n is described in the letters as a Saiyid of noble family, and he may be the Am\u012br \u1e62afi mentioned in S\u0101m Mirz\u0101's Tahfat S\u0101mi B.M. M.S. P. 45, as belonging to a noble family of Saiyids and as coming from N\u012bsh\u0101pur. He was a caligraphist. The three letters are written in high-flown Persian. It is, however, possible that the writer was the niece of Tahm\u0101sp and daughter of M'as\u016bm Beg whom Hum\u0101y\u016bn is said to have married in Persia. Jauhar 75.\n137. P. 416, n. 4. It has been suggested to me that Shahristan is a mistake for Shahr-i-Sistan, the city or capital of Sistan. But it appears from Y\u0101q\u016bt, Meynard 253 and 301, that the old capital of Sistan was called R\u0101m Shahristan, and was three faraakhs from Zaranj.\n\n138. P. 417, end of first para. For \u201c\u2018amw\u0101n\u201d read \u2018antw\u0101n.\n\n139. P. 427, l. 8. The Mir\u0101t al-\u0100alam has S\u0101bir Daq\u0101qq, i.e., a fuller.\n\n140. Do. n. 1.

The lines which follow the last distich quoted by A. F. are not very intelligible. Amir Sh\u0101hi was originally of Sabzaw\u0101r.

M. has S\u0101bir Quli for S\u0101bir Q\u0101q and dar muq\u0101m sairg\u0101h, i.e., theatre or place of recreation for sairg\u0101h. Q\u0101q seems to be right, for the \u0100alam \u0100rai has the jingle H\u0101ft S\u0101bin Q\u0101q ke n\u0101dira wy f\u0101q. Add. 27, 247, seems to be the only MS which has sairg\u0101h, but it also occurs in the Afzal-at-Taw\u0101rikh p. 122a of B. M. MS. Or. 4678, and in the \u0100alam \u0100rai Rein, Cat., supplement 7654, p. 178a.

The M\u016b\u02bf\u012bn who was Q\u0101z\u012b of Lahore is probably the officer mentioned at Vol. II, p. 163, as appointed to Malwa, and seems to have been different from Sharafu-al-din's father.\n\n160. P. 497 n. For \"Leydon\" read \"Leyden.\" Deerstalking is described by Bellew, Journal of Mission to Afghanistan, p. 327, as a favourite amusement of the Afghans.\n\n161. P. 500 line 19.

Bayley's Gujrat 446 S\u016bt\u1e6d\u0101n Mahm\u016bd had commanded his officers to give up the house of anyone guilty of either of those offences to halan, i.e., to plunder. See also Bombay lithograph of Mir\u0101t Sikandar\u012b p. 302. The reference to Bay\u0101zid is p. 35b. of his memoirs.\n\n167. P. 2. 537, n. 2. For \"on\" read \"in.\"\n\n168. P. 539, n. Erskine's opinion is confirmed by Hum\u0101y\u016bn's letter to Tahm\u0101sp B.M. MS. Add. 7688 p. 105b.\n169. P. 545, n. 3. There is a good deal about Bairam Oghl\u00e2n in Mahm\u00fbd's lives of Ism\u00e2\u00eel and Tahm\u00e2sp. He was an Uzbeg and governor of Balkh under Kisten Qara. The Ahsan Taw\u00e2rikh 101b speaks of Bairam's attacking Herat. He had been ruler of Gurjistan and was eventually killed in battle. See l. c. pp. 129b and 133a.\n\n170. Do. n. 7. In Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn's letter to Tahm\u00e2sp giving an account of the expedition to Balkh he is called Khw\u00e2ja Baq\u00ee.\n\n171. P. 557. I have not found this story about Ism\u00e2\u00eel's handkerchief in the anonymous life of that prince, but there is a sensational account of his crossing with his troops the rivers K\u00fbr and Aras (Araxes), vide p. 55a. But the story is told at length by D'Herbelot with only this difference that it was a slipper which Ism\u00e2\u00eel threw into a trench.\n\n172. P. 576, n. 1.

For Ma\u1e25m\u00fbd \u1e24asan read Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain\n\n15. P. 234, l. 9. Insert figure 5 after J\u00e2m.\n\n16. Do., l. 13. \"The country of Hindustan.\" Akwardly expressed, for B\u00e2bar was not then seeing Hindustan. But the akwardness is in the original and is apparently due to the fact that B\u00e2bar wrote his Memoirs after conquering India. The word both in the Turki and the Persian is Naw\u00e2hi, and this is rendered by P. des Courteille \"les abords.\"\n\n17. Do., n. 4. For Bar\u00eek-al read B\u00e2rik-ab.\n\n18. P. 236, five lines from foot. For \"his six brothers\" read \"six of his brothers.\"\n\n19. P. 237, n. 4. The remark near the end of this note is wrong, for the Mu\u1e25ammadan Ararat is not what Europeans call Ararat, but\nis a mountain called J\u016bdi D\u0101gh belonging to a range south of Lake Van and east of Jazira-b. Omar. It lies a long way S. S. W. of what is now known as Mount Ararat.\n\n20. P. 239, l. 4 from foot. Akwardly expressed, for of course Hum\u0101y\u016bn arrived before Lahore was taken. There should be a full stop after \"taken,\" the word \"and\" should be deleted, and \"on\" made On.\n\n21. Do., n. 4. The B\u0101gh Waf\u0101 was at Adinapur (Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d); the B\u0101gh \u0160af\u0101 was higher up the river near C\u0101r B\u0101gh, and there was another B\u0101gh \u0160af\u0101 in the Salt-Range.\n\n22. P. 242, top line. For gabions substitute t\u016br\u0101s. They were not gabions, but light wattles (?) which the soldiers carried as they marched. See B\u0101bar 86, and P. de Courteille 151.\n\n23. P. 248, l. 15. The words \"according to their rank\" are misplaced. They should come after \"presente.\"\n\n24. P. 253, 4 lines from foot. Perhaps Q\u0101\u1e63i Z\u012b\u0101 is the Zianudd\u012bn N\u016br Beg of Khwandamir's Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma, and who, he says got the title of Am\u012br-i-Zakat.\n\n25. P. 254, l. 3.

Insert comma after Q\u0101sim.\n\n30. P. 277, Verse. The whole verse is given by Khwandamir in his Hum\u0101y\u016bn n\u0101ma. See translation by Sadu Sukh L\u0101l, p. 45, B.M. MS. Add. 30,774.\n\n31. P. 281, last sentence. Perhaps this Kicak or K\u016bcak was the brother whom Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n left in Qandah\u0101r, when he deserted his post, and who surrendered to Tahm\u0101sp. The Afzal T\u0101rikh B.M. Ms. Or. 4678, p. 96a says he was a brother of Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n. The A\u1e25s\u0101b T.B.M. MS. Or. 4184 calls him, p. 107, Kach\u012b Kh\u0101n and Mahm\u016bd Or. 2839, p. 1831 calls him Kechak kh\u0101n.\n\n32. P. 285, Verse. For the first two lines substitute\n\nThe year of his auspicious (hum\u0101y\u016bn\u0101t\u012b) birth is \"May Almighty God increase thy stature.\"\n\nThe second line is a chronogram. In n. 4, for qadran read qudr.\nand for Z\u0101dakall\u0101h\u016b read Z\u0101dak Allah. Perhaps S\u0101m\u0101n\u012b only means that he was a native of S\u0101m\u0101na (in India).\n\n33. P. 293, l. 4. Read Kan\u0101r for K\u0101n\u0101r.\n\n34. P. 294, n. 1. Ab\u016b Tur\u0101b's account shows that Bah\u0101dur was present at the battle of P\u0101n\u012bpat, though he did not take part in it.\n\n35. P. 295, Verse II. This comes from \u1e24\u0101fiz Ode 220. Brockhaus 141.\n\n36. P. 296, l. 9. Ab\u016b Tur\u0101b says in history of Gujrat, p. 13a, that the twenty kors of old coinage were equal to 30 kors, 50 lakhs mur\u0101di. Mur\u0101di is explained in dictionaries as meaning small money.\n\n37. P. 302, n. 1. Ab\u016b Tur\u0101b, p. 79, also gives the title of Khud\u0101wand Kh\u0101n to Khw\u0101ja \u1e62af\u0101r.\n\n38. P. , last line. Khw\u0101ndam\u012br gives his full name, p. 72 or 47, as Maul\u0101n\u0101 Muhiyuddin Mu\u1e25ammad Farq\u0101h\u012b.\n\n39. P. 315, n. 1. For Kaif\u016b read Kaif. But I doubt if Hum\u0101y\u016bn suspected any play on the word. The real explanation of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's anger seems to be that the chapter of the Elephant is a denunciatory and terrifying one, and used in compositions which convey threats. Perhaps Hum\u0101y\u016bn remembered that it was so used by Sh\u0101hrukh, the son of Taimur, in a threatening letter which he addressed in 833 or 835 A.H. to Barsab\u0101i, the Sultan of Egypt. See the story in the extract from Makriz\u012b given in De Sacy's Chrestomathie Arabe II.\n\n40. P. 316, n. 4. Apparently the 'Alam L\u0101d\u012b here mentioned is 'Al\u0101'udd\u012bn, the uncle of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Sultan.\n\n41. P. 317, n. 1. Yes, Khud\u0101wand Kh\u0101n was a very old man. Ab\u016b Tur\u0101b says, 28b, that he was Akh\u016bnd of Sultan Mogaffar and had been Vizier and Vakil of four Sultans. Fer\u012bghta says he was the father of Cing\u012bz Kh\u0101n, not the son, and Ab\u016b Tur\u0101b makes the same statement.\n\n42. P. 320, l. 7. As\u0101wal is spelt Ash\u0101wal in Sir Theodore Hope's book on Ahmadabad, and is the spot where the original chief-tain was defeated by Q\u0101sim.\n\n43. P. 324, l. 10. Ab\u016b Tur\u0101b tells this story, but he does not give his informant's name. He only says that he was an Akh\u016bnd and\nhad been Bah\u0101dur's teacher and that in this way he had become acquainted with him. Nor does he say anything about his informant's taking an oath. Qu? is the Q\u016b\u1e6dbu-d-d\u012bn of A.F.'s story Ab\u016b Tur\u0101b's uncle?\n\n44. P. 325, n. 2. I have seen somewhere that there was a mosque in Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d called Masjid \u0160af\u0101, but that it was not built till 994 A.H.\n\n45. P. 886, l. 19. For B\u0101b\u0101 Kh\u0101n read B\u0101b\u0101 Beg.\n\n46. P. 341. I now incline to think that Narhan is correct. It is a well-known ford and is mentioned in the 2nd volume. But though A.F. has written Narhan, it does not seem likely that Hum\u0101y\u016bn went so far east.\n\n47. P. 359, l. 17. For \u2018Abdu-l-Makr\u012b read Abd\u0101l Makr\u012b.\n\n48. P. 368, n. 1. Sh\u0101h Husain had a son by Gulbarak B. who died young.\n\n49. P. 396, n. 1. For J. V. read I. O.\n\n50. P. 407, n. 2. See Burnes' Cabool, 1842, p. 115. He says the correct name is Dingote, and that it is 6 m. above K\u0101l\u0101 B\u0101gh.\n\n51. P. 408, l. 10. After Kh\u0101wand, for Mu\u1e25ammad read Ma\u1e25m\u016bd.\n\n52. P. 416, n. 4. The following note by George P. Tate, Esq., of the Indian Survey, has been kindly furnished to me by Mr. Irvine:\n\n\"Qila'-i-\u016ak, \u016ak is the ancient name of a small district to the north of the Ham\u016bn-i-Helmand, and therefore of Seist\u0101n, the chief towns of which are L\u0101sh and Juwain. The names of these towns are existing at the present day, but the name of the district has apparently fallen into desuetude, as it does not seem to be generally known. Qila'-i-\u016ak would therefore merely mean the principal fort, or capital of the district, the name of which, if it had one, was not generally known. A similar case can be found not far off from that locality. In the Zafar-n\u0101mah the author writes of the capital of Seist\u0101n as Shahr-i-Seist\u0101n, and does not mention it by name. This practice still holds good. The word \"Shahr\" is used, as we use the word \"town,\" with reference to London. Rarely, or never, is the \"Shahr\" or capital, spoken of by its name of Nasrat\u0101b\u0101d. This is the modern capital. The site of the ancient capital of Seist\u0101n is at a short distance to the N.-E. of the modern capital. \u016ak, judging from its propinquity to Seist\u0101n, pro-\nbably was subject to the (K\u0101i\u0101n\u012b) Maliks of Seistan, from whose country it was divided by the Helmand, if the Helmand at that time did not find a more southerly outlet for its waters, which seems to me to have possibly been the case.\n\n\"Humayun, if he passed through \u00dak on his way to Persia, took a route which at the present day lies within the Afghan border, and the reason of his adopting this route would probably have been the evil reputation for lawlessness earned by the inhabitants of the Kohistan, that is, the country around Neh and Birjand, through which the trade route (now in use) between Seistan and Mashhad passes. This would probably have been the shortest route to Mashhad, had it been safe to use it.\"\n\n53. P. 434, n. 3. For Gazargah read G\u0101zarg\u0101h.\n\n54. P. 439, last line. For Zailaq read Yailaq. Yailaq means summer-quarters, and the translation should apparently be \"first stage of the summer-quarters\"\n\n55. P. 436, n. 7. For Qadar read Qid\u0101r. See Genesis xxv. 13.\n\n56. P. 440, n. 1. For Bay\u0101zid 176, read Bay\u0101zid 17b.\n\n57. P. 442, n. 2. This identification is wrong.\n\n58. P. 448, n. 2. For \u0160afi read \u0160afi.\n\n59. Do., n. 3. For Saddi read Sadd.\n\n60. P. 445, l. 6. For Paik Muhammad read Beg Muhammad.\n\n61. P. 448, last para. It would seem from Gulbadan Begam's Memoirs that either he or his relative Kecak or Kucak wrote an account of Humayun's adventures in Sind. Kicak is said to have been a brother of Khwaja Kil\u0101n, so that Khwaja Gh\u0101zi was related to him also. Note 5 is not altogether correct. Khwaja Gh\u0101zi and Rustam Koka fell into disgrace in Persia for stealing Humayun's jewels, but he got over that and was made accountant when Humayun returned to Afghanistan. But there he was dismissed for defalcations, see p. 544.\n\nIn the passage of the Ain referred to by me as Blochmann VII, A.F. is represented as saying that the office of Mashrif was higher than that of diwan, but surely there must be some mistake, for at p. VI., last line, Blochmann translates Mashrif as clerk, and at p. 544 we are told that Afzal was promoted from being Mashrif to being diwan. Perhaps the word at p. VII is not Mashrif, but Masharrif-i-diwan, i.e., the exalter of the diwan or the Diwan par excellence.\n\n61. P. 448, l. 4. Brother (bar\u0101dar) seems a mistake here for\nbrother's son (bar\u0101darz\u0101da), see p. 542, last para., where Kok\u012b is described as the paternal uncle of H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad.\n\n62. P. 448, l. 13. The description here evidently refers to Mahram and not to Hasan.\n\n63. P. 548, near foot. For B\u0101b\u0101 Sihrindi read B\u0101b\u0101 Sihrindi.\n\n64. P. 460, near middle. For Mu\u1e25ammad M, read Mu\u1e25ammadi M.\n\n65. P. 466, l. 20. For Kot Laka read Kohlak\u0101, and translate \"hill-country.\" Lak\u0101 means country.\n\n66. Do. 7 lines from foot. For \"strive\" read \"strove.\"\n\n67. P. 475, n. 3. Nad\u012bm Koka is called Nad\u012bm Beg by Khw\u0101ndam\u012br in his Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma, p. 149b, and is described as a Turk and as in high favour with Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and the recipient of a khilat. He calls him jan\u0101b am\u0101rat sh\u0101'\u0101r farkhanda \u012bw\u0101r Nad\u012bm Beg muhrd\u0101r (sealer).\n\n68. P. 482, n. 2. For \"come back to Hum\u0101y\u016bn\" read \"gone back to K\u0101mr\u0101n.\"\n\n69. P. 520, l. 7. Insert marginal number 271, and p. 521, l. 5, from foot insert 272.\n\n70. P. 522, n. 2. A.F. calls him Buyat\u0101t at pp. 543 and 565.\n\n71. P. 526, n. 3. For Gulb\u0101n read Gulb\u0101r.\n\n72. P. 529, l. 10. The word \"jamjhama is used again in text II. 117, and clearly means there a morass or collection of water.\n\n73. P. 530, l. 11. For B\u0101b\u012b read B\u0101ba, and in next line insert \"army\" after victorious.\n\n74. P. 584, l. 6. For B\u0101rgbegi read B\u0101rbegi.\n\n75. P. 540, n. 1. For tamaatogh read tum\u0101ntogh.\n\n76. P. 541. For marginal number 248 read 284.\n\n77. P. 543, last para. This is an interesting paragraph and requires elucidation. It appears from the \u0100in, Blochmann VI, that the words Vizier and Diwan are synonymous. The meaning, then, seems to be that Khw\u0101ja Q\u0101sim Buyat\u0101t had been made the Vizier or head of the department, and that then M\u012brz\u0101 Beg had been appointed in his room. He was a poet and apparently inefficient and consequently Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi exercised unlimited power. That he was a dishonest man is proved by Gulbadan Begam's Memoirs, where we learn that he stole Hum\u0101y\u016bn's jewels. Apparently the investigation was undertaken at the suggestion of Mir Barka, who belonged to Sabza-\nwar, and is called in the Ain Sayyid Barka. Husain Quli was made mukassil of the affair, i.e., apparently reporter of the findings of the committee. The word mutaghallib is given in Steingass as meaning victorious or powerful, but here it seems to be used in the sense of embezzling, and it is so understood by the Lucknow editor, who says the Khwajas were found guilty of taghallab, i.e., embezzlement. I think we should render the passage here \"the fraudulent clerks.\"\n\n78. P. 543, l. 4 from foot. For Khawand.\n\n79. P. 544, n. 1. This note is wrong. The Hasan Quli meant is probably the sealbearer often mentioned by Bayazid. See p. 440, n. 1.\n\n80. P. 544, l. 9. For \"condemned\" read \"defaulting.\"\n\n81. Do., l. 11. Insert ah\u0101nb\u0101ni after \"His Majesty.\"\n\n82. P. 551, l. 6. Dele stop after Muhammad.\n\n83. P. 68, l. 16. Insert on margin 303.\n\n84a n. 2. Dele last sentence. The word in the Memoirs is Bakhshi.\n\n84. P. 599, l. 17. Dele word \"as.\" This last sentence, about Jogi Khan, has no connection with the account of the Gakkars, and should have been put into a separate paragraph and prefaced by the words \"In fine.\"\n\n85. P. 600, l. 9. Possible the clause within brackets refers to K\u0101mr\u0101n and not to Salim Khan. Substitute at l. 11, \"assistance for his own ruin\" for \"auxiliaries for his disloyalty.\n\n86. P. 608, n. 3. For \"Newcomb\" read Newcome.\n\n86a. P. 612. According to the Darbar Akbari, p. 312, it was 'Abdullah Sult\u0101npuri who sent the boots and also a whip.\n\n87. P. 614. For Salim Shah read Salim Khan. A.F. is always careful not to style Sher or his son Salim, Shah.\n\n88. P. 628. The list is A.F.'s not Bayazid's and should not have appeared as a note.\n\n89. P. 665. Ferishta says that he, after search, found Humayun's divan, and he gives extracts from it.\n\nNote to Errata and Addenda No. 48\n\nI have since found the source of the author of the Darbari Akbari's statement about Bhawal Anaga. It is the Akbarnama, vol. III. pp. 742, 43 Bib. Ind ed.\nThere the death of Bh\u0101wal Anaga is recorded, and it is stated that she was the daughter of Rai Jog\u0101 Parh\u0101r (perhaps the P\u0101r\u0101 or P\u016br\u0101 of Jarrett II. 242) and that Hum\u0101y\u016bn after his marriage with Miriam Mak\u0101ni gave Bh\u0101wal in marriage to Jal\u0101l Goinds (i.e., reciter or singer.) It is also said that she was the first to nurse Akbar. She died in the 43rd year on 24 Tir (about 4th July 1568) so that she must have been well over seventy. She is evidently quite a different person from Mah\u0101m Anaga.\nAKBARN\u0100MA.\n\nIN THE NAME OF GOD, THE MERCIFUL, THE COMPASSIONATE.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nAlmighty God! What a profound thought and glorious idea it is that the subtle apprehenders of truth, whose bright minds are like the breath of morning, and who are keen-sighted students of the\n\n1 All\u0101h Akbar (Arabic.\u2014All\u0101hu Akbar) God is very Great. This expression is called the takb\u012br\u2014the magnifying\u2014and is often used at the commencement of undertakings. A.F. places it at the beginning of the Akbarn\u0101ma and also of the \u0100in. Blochmann says, (166n.) \"The words 'in Akbar' are ambiguous; they mean, 'God is Great,' or 'Akbar is God.' There is no doubt that Fisbar liked the phrase for its ambiguity; for it was used on coins, the imperial seals and the heading of books, farma\u1e47s, etc.\" He then translates from Bad\u0101oni, (II, 210) as follows; \"It was during these days (A.H. 983=1575-6) that His Majesty once asked how people would like it, if he ordered the words All\u0101hu Akbar to be cut on the imperial seal and the dies of his coins. Most said, people would like it very much. But \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Ibr\u0101h\u012bm objected and said, the phrase had an ambigious meaning and the Emperor might substitute the Koran verse \"Lazikru All\u0101hi akbaru\u2014To think of God is the greatest thing\u2014because it involved no ambiguity. But His Majesty got displeased and said, it was surely sufficient that no man who felt his weakness would claim divinity; he merely looked to the sound of the words and he had never thought that a thing could be carried to such an extreme.\" Mr. Lowe (230) has copied this translation but it seems to me that Mr. Blochmann meant to write \"self-evident,\" and not \"sufficient,\" for the Persian is \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0627\u0646\u062f mu'aian ast. Mr. Rehatsek (\"Akbar's Repudiation of Isl\u0101m,\" 14) translates: \"But the Emperor was not pleased and replied, 'It is self-evident that no man can in his perfect weakness pretend to be God. Our intention is based on the literal meaning and there is no occasion\nschedules of Creation and drawers of diagrams on the tablet of wisdom and perception, have not, with the exception of Speech which is but a vagrant breeze and fluctuating gale, found in the combinations of the elements or in material forms, anything so sublime, or a jewel so rare that it come not within the mould of price, that Reason's balance cannot weigh it, that Language's measure cannot contain it, and that it be beyond the scale of Thought;\u2014and yet, how should it be otherwise? Without help of Speech, the inner world's capital could not be built, nor this evil outer world's civilization be conceived.\n\n'to transfer it (to my name.)' I think the passage might be rendered thus, \"He (Akbar) did not approve, 'and observed, 'It is self-evident that a humble slave cannot claim 'the Godhead; we are thinking only 'of the verbal coincidence (with our 'own name), there is no sense in put-ting such an interpretation (as you 'have suggested) on the phrase.'\" The word \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 man\u0101sabat\u2014which I have translated coincidence occurs thrice in the beginning of the Akbar-n\u0101ma in the sense of connection, viz., Bib. Ind. ed. 2, ll. 2 and 9 fr. foot and 22, l. 6.\n\nThe conversation is, on the whole, creditable both to Akbar and H\u0101j\u012b Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. Akbar, I think, admitted that he chose the phrase on account of its consonance with his name but denied that he had any intention of claiming to be God. Probably H\u0101j\u012b Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's well-meant suggestion would not have mended matters, for people would still have remarked on the double significance of the words. See further on this point, Bad\u0101oni II. 268 (Lowe, 277). In Faiz\u012b's Diw\u0101n, there is a long poem in praise of Akbar, every couplet of which ends with the words, All\u0101h Akbar.\n\n1 \u062c\u062f\u0648\u0644 Jadwal plural of \u062c\u062f\u0648\u0644 jadwal, a column. The word is often used to signify astronomical tables or catalogues.\n\n2 \u0628\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u063a\u0634\u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0646 lit.: compass-openers.\n\n3 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u0628 \u0639\u0635\u0631\u06cc tarakkub 'ansari: lit.: elemental combination or insertion of one element in another. The similar phrase \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u0628 \u0639\u0635\u0631\u06cc occurs in \u0100in No. 4 (13, 111.) Tarakkub is used in the Akbar-n\u0101ma (22, 1. 6) in opposition to tajarrud, i.e., singleness or nudity. It appears that the phrase refers to the four compounds described in \u0100in No. 13 about the origin of metals. There it says that the Creator, by calling into existence the four elements raised up wondrous forms (paikar). Further on, we are told that compounds (murakkab), are brought into existence, viz.: 1st, \u0101g\u0101r-i-lati doings from on high, as rain, snow, etc.; 2nd, stones; 3rd, plants; 4th, animals. (Blochmann 39.)\n\n4 \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0631 \u0647\u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u06cc paikar haiyulani: material form. Haiyulani is from the Greek \u1f30\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7, matter. I think the expression is synonymous or nearly so with tarakkub 'ansari.

MS. No. 564 says that speech is compared to fire, on account of its vehemence; to air, because it is breath; to earth, because its place of utterance is the tongue which belongs to the visible world; and to water, because of its smoothness and mobility.\n\n\\(^2\\) laif, \u0101bnuma, showing water or looking like water. \u0100b also means lustre and Chalmers translates \"of liquid purity.\" But A. F. is evidently thinking of the element of water. See a similar passage in \u0100in No. 4, (Bib. Ind. 13), where gold is compared to each of the four elements. There is a passage in A. F.'s preface to the \u0100in where mankind is divided into four classes, corresponding to the four elements.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sipah-s\u0101l\u0101r, lit.: Soldier-Chief; but the description in the \u0100in of the duties and qualifications of the Sipah-s\u0101l\u0101r shows that he was rather a Vizier or Prime Minister. Indeed A. F. begins by calling him the Vicegerent of his Majesty. (Jarrett II, 37).\n\n\\(^4\\) M\u016bbid m\u016bbid\u0101ni-d\u0101nish.\n\n\\(^5\\) ab\u016b-l-\u0101b\u0101t, father of fathers; but the meaning is not that Speech is the forefather or first-parent of mind but that it is the Adam or primeval ancestor engendered by the mind.\n\nThe passage from \"Judges\" to \"birth\" is a military metaphor, for \u1e63uf\u016bf (ranks) means lines of soldiers and anjuman may mean an army. The phrase which I have rendered \"true son and heir\" is khalaf-\u0101\u1e63-\u1e63idq or khalaf \u1e63idq and means a successor or perhaps \"Vicar worthy of his proto-type.\" The tezhdid and article of Text seem unnecessary, Lane 795c.\n\nChalmers translates, \"Those who can appreciate the highest grandeur, have by means of their sense and penetration understood this exalted foundation of the Council Room of Reason to be even the son (the MS. has sun\u2014clearly a clerical error) of the sincerity of the heart and the kindred of wisdom have supposed it to be the furnace of the soul or rather the Palladium of the affections of the mind.\"\ncially pre\u00ebminent is that Speech\\(^1\\) which is the ornamented argument of the splendid volume; adorned preface of the sublime code, that is, is the praise of the Lord of heaven and earth; panegyric of the Distributor of life and Creator of the body; which is at once a stage of exaltation for the beginning and a heart-entrancing ornament for the close; at once caravan-conductor\\(^2\\) of the eloquent and prince of eloquence; chamber-lamp of the sitters in darkness; solitude-adorning companion of the recluse; pain-increaser of the lovers of the path of God-seeking; ulcer-plaster of the wounded dwellers in the recess of impatience; cordial for the drinkers of sorrow's bitter tears; embalmer\\(^3\\) of the broken-hearted denizens of the hermitage of silence; marshaller of the brave in the contests of divine love; banquet-lamp of the beloved\\(^4\\) ones in the palace of peace; thirst-increaser\\(^5\\) of thirsty-lipped inquirers; hunger-increaser\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is difficult to regard all these expressions as referring to speech only and Chalmers has, apparently, considered them as descriptive of the Almighty, for after the words \"Creator of the body\" (See infra) he translates, \"He bestows the basis of exaltation to the commencement of eternity.\" But I think the reference is really to speech and that A. F. is thinking of the logos. I learn from the translation of the Gulshani-r\u0101z of my friend Mr. Whinfield, that Sufis rendered the Neo-Platonic logos by the phrase 'aql-i-kull, universal reason. A. F.'s language may be compared with Niz\u0101m\u012b's address to Speech (sulh\u0101n) at the beginning of the Mak\u0101zanu-l-asr\u0101r. The author of the Ma'\u0101gir-l-umara (II. 622) says that A. F. has been called a Niz\u0101m\u012b in prose.\n\n\\(^2\\) The force of this antithesis or parallelism is not very clear, but apparently some such distinction as that between the Church militant and the Church triumphant is intended. While the eloquent are travelling, i.e., marching on as praisers of God\u2014and have not yet attained their goal, speech is their leader and when they have arrived at their resting place, i.e., at perfection\u2014speech becomes their sovereign. Chalmers translates, \"He leads the Caravan of the Eloquent and He is the Prince of Oratory.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) Properly, pissasphalt, or, as Chalmers has it, embalming drug. The word in the text is momi\u0101t from which comes our word mummy. We might therefore translate, mumifier.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ma'\u0101gh\u016bq miz\u0101j\u0101n, perhaps filled with love or excessively loving.\n\n\\(^5\\) Istisq\u0101b\u0101k\u0101sh lit. giver of dropsy. Thirst is often an accompaniment of dropsy. Sa'd\u012b (Gulistan II. Story 33), speaks of a dropsical person as not being satisfied even by the Euphrates, and there is a similar reference in the Bist\u0101n (III. l. 26) to the condition of a dropsical person,\nof hungry-hearted ones in the wilderness of search. Hence it is that wakeful-hearted sages,\u2014with all their tumult of love and restless longing,\u2014have stayed the hand of contemplation at the hem of the divine canopy\\(^1\\) and with thirsty lips, and blistered feet, and the gulping down of thousands of agitations and cries, have set the seal of silence on their lips and\u2014wisely wrapping the foot of respect in the skirt of humility,\u2014have not attempted what has not been vouchsafed to them from the almonry of destiny.\n\n**Verse.**\n\nLetters\\(^2\\) and dots are the desert sand in Thy perfect path.\nIn the universe of Thy wisdom, the city of speech is but some market-booths.\\(^3\\)\nThe warders of jealousy\\(^4\\) at Thy door, smite the understanding,\nWith blows of astonishment in front, and strokes of ignorance\\(^5\\) from behind.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Haudaj* (howdah) which also means a camel-litter. It is probably used in this sense in the *Akbarnama*, I. 14, l. 12 from foot.\n\n\\(^2\\) Lit. points and letters. By the dots are meant the diacritical points. The lines are Faizi's. See *Ain* I. 236, and Blochmann, 550.\n\nMr. Blochmann renders the lines, thus;\u2014\n\n\"Science is like blinding desert-sand on the road to Thy perfection;\n\"the town of literature is a mere hamlet, compared with the world of Thy knowledge. Thy jealousy, \"the guard of Thy door, stuns human thought by a blow in the face and gives human ignorance a slap on the nape of the neck.\"\n\nChalmers has,\u2014\u201cThe Viceroy of dismav spurns our fancy from Thy door;\u2014With the blow of stupor upon its front and the thrust of ignorance from behind.\u201d\n\n\\(^3\\) *t\u0101r\u012bq r\u016bst\u0101*, a market-town or hamlet.\n\n\\(^4\\) Or perhaps, the watchmen of Thy jealousy. A. F. speaks (42, l. 10) of the Divine jealousy's preserving from public knowledge the true character of Akbar's horoscope.\n\n\\(^5\\) The meaning seems to be that the human understanding is\nIn other words, praise of the incomparable Deity lies outside the field of possibility, and the panegyric of the unequalled God is beyond the field of existence.\\(^1\\)\n\n**VERSE.**\n\nWherever discourse\\(^2\\) deals with the knowledge of God,\nOur thoughts' praise becomes dispraise.\nBehold rashness, how it boils over with daring!\nCan a drop embrace the ocean?\nThink not that it is even a single letter of the Book,\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0627\u06a9\u0648\u0648\u0646 akw\u0101n.\u2014There is a Hindi word akw\u0101n signifying calculation but here, akw\u0101n seems to be the plural of \u06a9\u0648\u0646 kun, existence or world.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u062d\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u062d had\u012bgh, which may either mean tradition or simply mention or discourse. It also means new or recent and perhaps the author of the lines wished to take advantage of these meanings. I think the primary meaning here is talk or discourse for the lines are Faiz\u012b's and we find him elsewhere using had\u012bgh in the sense of discourse; e.g., Akbarn\u0101ma III. 687, l. 10, where, addressing himself, the poet says, \"Faiz\u012b! keep silent from this discourse!\" The lines in our Text occur (but in other order) in the selection from Faiz\u012b's poems given in the Akbarn\u0101ma, III, 684, 1, 2 and 683, last line.)\n\nChalmers thus translates the lines:\n\n\"When our traditions could trace\nthe knowledge of God,\n\"Our most grateful thoughts become ingratitude.\"\n\n\"Behold our arrogance in the ebullition of our daring\n\"When a drop would clasp the ocean in its embrace,\n\"Think not any volume contains a letter of it;\n\"For a letter is but as flax and it is the shining Moon.\n\"How long wilt thou arrange the harness of thy speech,\n\"Place thy step here with the offering of helplessness.\n\n\\(^3\\) This difficult couplet receives illustration from the beginning of a letter to Sh\u0101h 'Abb\u0101s of Persia in the first book of the Insh\u0101.' There it is said that, if all the dots of our intelligences and all the schedules of our thoughts were combined with the armies of knowledge and troops of sciences, their total would not represent one letter of the Book of Praise, or be one ray of the Sun. And then we are told, in evident allusion to Sa'd\u012b's famous couplet about the leaves of the trees, that the works of creation praise God with a tongueless tongue. It is clear then that the word book (kit\u0101b) is used in the above verse, in a mystical sense for the mysterious Record of the Divine Praise.\nFor the Letter is muslin\u00b9 and the Book moonlight.\nHow long wilt thou be an embroiderer\u00b2 of speech?\nStay thy foot here, with the acknowledgment\u00b3 of humility.\n\nSo long as there is no link between terrestrials and celestials,\nand the path of speech between the earthly and the heavenly is\nclosed, what intercourse can there be between the limited and the\nunlimited, so that an atom of the dust can have any lot in the pure,\nworld-warming Sun? What goal in the boundless plains of necessity\nand eternity is possible for a prisoner in the subterraneous vault of\naccident and modernity; and what strength can he have to traverse\nthem? What portion can a bewildered, headless and footless mote\u2074\nhave in the beams of the world-lighting Sun? It can only be tossed\nabout in the wind. What is a dewdrop to the swelling ocean or to\nthe cloud surcharged with rain? 'Tis but the vaunt of a parched\nlip.

All dictionaries agree\nthat it is exceedingly thin, so much so that it tears when the moon\nshines on it;\u2014it is muslin.\u201d A. F.

The kur\u1e63\u012b is supposed to be God's judgment seat and the author's meaning seems to be that God is higher than any such imaginary throne. Lane (s.v. kur\u1e63\u012b) quotes an authority as saying that the kur\u1e63\u012b is the place of the feet, and s.v. 'arsh, quotes a saying of Muhammad that the seven heavens and earths, by the side of the kur\u1e63\u012b, are naught but as a ring thrown down in a desert land; and such is the kur\u1e63\u012b with respect to the 'arsh (the empyrean.)\n\u2075 \u064a\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0643\u0650 \u062e\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0652\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0628\u064e\u0646\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u0645\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650 lit. the family of contingent existences.\n\"sovereign,\u2014is that they make the night-illuminating jewel of\nreason,\u2014one of the bountiful Divine Ruler's greatest gifts,\u2014into\na bright lamp, and employ it for sweeping and cleansing the courts\nof their outer and inner man.

Most texts, however, read \\(t\u0101\\). The Elliot MS. (Bodleian 4s) has \\(y\u0101\\) and the Walker MS. (Bodleian 115) had \\(y\u0101\\) also but this has been altered into \\(t\u0101\\),\u2014I suppose by the copyist. B.M. MS. Add. No. 6544 has also \\(y\u0101\\). B.M. MS. Add. No. 5610 has \\(t\u0101\\).\n\n\\(T\u0101\\) may be right and the meaning be that the result of attempting to number the Divine benefits, etc., is that one finds the calculation beyond one's power and so gives up praise in despair. The translation, in this case, would run thus; \"Until\" (or \"with the result that\") \"one recognizes that praise is beyond human comprehension and so joins those who have fallen short of the portico of praise.\" The author's meaning seems to be that for awhile he thought he had come to see what was \"the chief end of man,\" vis., to do his best in the situation in which he might be placed. This cheered him in spite of the path's being long and hard, but suddenly, a fresh difficulty presented itself, for he recognized that the praise of God which per-\n\nhaps, we should call Theology and which the author regarded as man's prime care. Cf. the Shorter Catechism\u2014\"man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him for ever\" did not consist in either of the two following things;\n\n1. Attempting to comprehend the inscrutable.\n\n2. Much speaking about His bounties, hoping thereby to win God's favour and to have glory of men.\n\nNor again was it right to abandon the study of Theology as beyond our powers, and devote our energies to the improvement of our own miserable selves, even if such endeavour were after moral as well as material advancement. No! true Theology or Divine worship consisted in renouncing the attempt either to fathom the Divine mysteries or to recount His benefits and to take refuge in acknowledgment of our baseness and impotence. The author's view, in short, is that expressed in the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican, of which perhaps, he may have heard from his friend Aquaviva. These reflections led him to see that he must strive after worshipping God, though in a different fashion from that of the theologians, and eventually he found rest in the discovery that the highest form of Doxology was to record the achievements,\u2014spiritual and temporal\u2014of that Divine master-piece, the\nporch of thanksgiving; nor should we style self-culture\\(^1\\) the recital of the Divine praise, and growing weary-hearted\\(^2\\) at the darkness of the road and the distance of the goal, regard such self-deception as a gain, and with abandonment of thanksgiving, set about whatever the cheatery of the hour represent as our true aim.\n\nRather the note of Praise is to lay this praise-loving, self-adorning, self-auctioning spirit\\(^3\\) on the threshold of service, at the base of supplication and humiliation and to cast it down from the arch\\(^4\\) of\n\nEmperor Akbar. Unfortunately we may say of Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl what has been predicated of the poet Young\u2014that he never gets hold of a thought that he does not tear it to pieces.\n\nAs the passage is difficult, I give Chalmers' translation below:\n\n\"For the meaning of the giving praise to the Almighty is neither that we should inquire into the qualities of His perfection and then apply them to His Majesty\u2014nor that we should reckon up the endless bounties of Eternity and then offer up in return for them, the fabricated wares of our own commendations; nor should we suppose them too excellent for human ken and thus despair of reaching the portico of gratitude; nor should we denominate the adornment of ourselves, the recital of God's praises; nor become sorrowful of heart from the dimness of the path and the delicacy of the undertaking, and seizing the opportunity of empty excuses, refrain from shewing forth His praises by commencing with the evasion which may appear most plausible for the purpose. But rather the true intent of God's praise is this:\u2014that our grateful soul should place self-conceit and self-boasting on \"the threshold of obedience at the footstool of submission and devotion, and thus expel them from the palace of self-interest; so that our real helplessness may be decked with the semblance of piety and our inward and outward man may be adorned with humility and poverty which will thus suit the seemliness of the breast of our purpose and tend towards the praise of the bounteous Creator of the Universe.\"\n\nChalmers' MS.

It should come in at p. 13, l. 11, at the end of the second paragraph, and immediately after the word \"thanksgiving.\"\n\n\"Inasmuch as my aim was lofty, and my intent majestic, my scheming soul could not extricate herself from confusion and set free the word-framing tongue. My constitution would not allow that, like the ignorant and the imitative, I should enter the Praise-Court of the most glorious God by force of words and ejaculations, and be soothed by borrowed metaphor and hackneyed phrase. Nor yet would my effusive zeal permit that I should, after the manner of feeble-souled sages, refrain from searching after Him, or stay my lips from speech concerning him, and thus by a contradictory confession,\\(^1\\) disparate from one's practice in secular matters, proclaim inability and simultaneously hold one's self forth as a right-thinking utterer of verities.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) *Iqr\u0101r-i-n\u0101qiq*. The meaning seems to be that the same person who excuses himself from praising God by the plea of inability, yet in other matters, for instance in returning thanks to men, claims to be endowed with eloquence. Chalmers has \"a lame conclusion which obtains not in other matters.\" Perhaps he read *qar\u0101n*.\n\n\"may appear most plausible for the purpose. But rather the true intent of God's praise is this:\u2014 \"that our grateful soul should place self-conceit and self-boasting on\n\n\\(^4\\) *\u1e6d\u0101q*, *\u1e6d\u0101q\u012b*, arch or archway, also alcove. *\u1e6c\u0101q-i-na\u1e63r* appears to be a\nself-consciousness and self-regard, so that its inward poverty may be adorned by outward submissiveness, and its inner and outer nature be decked with humility and lowness till fitness\\(^1\\) grace the bosom of purpose and be turned into praise of the Omnipotent Creator.\n\nNow as such wares\\(^2\\) of thanksgiving are abundant in the booths of men and are especially plentiful in my own stall, why do I withhold myself from Divine praise and why do I delay to laud the Eternal One? Under any circumstances, it is better for me to escape from this deceiving misery of self-pleasing and to address myself to the heights of lofty thanksgiving.\n\nI was a long time in perplexity, having neither ability to speak nor power to remain silent, when suddenly a door of light was opened by the intellect, that glory of life, and my confused heart found the neck of hope fitted with the noose of resolution.

The reference is to the glorified spirits of saints and prophets.

And assuredly, to make over a world to one man and to consign to him the momentous affairs of a universe is to incorporate in him the world of reality, or rather to make him its soul. Especially if he be a world-adorner seized with the desire of inhaling the fragrant breezes of Truth's spring-time and is seated on the lofty throne of felicity. Still more if he be the Lord of an Age who in addition to these two endowments, has a heart and mind fed from a hidden fountain. Above all, if he be that altar of the pious who by the Divine aid, has risen above these degrees and has become colourist of the House of Truth, banquet-illuminator of the Hall of Realities, confidant of the Presence Chamber, intimate of the pure palace of unity, and is by auspicious fate seated on the throne of fortune. Sway over the outer and inner world and unravelment of knots, both spiritual and temporal, are conspicuous in him. Therefore is he the adorner of the imperial throne; the uplifter of the banner of God's shadow in our happy age; aggregation of the artists of thought and wisdom, or rather master-piece of the eternal artificers. With such vast stores of true praise in thy keeping, why remainest thou distraught in search?\"\n\nOn hearing this soul-refreshing message, the morning breeze of felicity arose; the stock of eternal bliss was collected; the eye of hope grew bright; the outer world became current coin; the inner world exulted; the skirt of success fell into my hand; the wished-for countenance came in sight.\n\nGood God! What a strange mystery it is that in historical\n\n---\n\n1 The line of thought seems to be, that the works of the Creator are His highest panegyric and that the greatest of these works on earth is a king, consequently the description of a great king is the highest form of Divine praise. Evidently A. F. would not have agreed with Pope as to what was the noblest work of God.\n\n2 \"Meaning love of truth and good fortune; the latter being considered a virtue of no mean order in the East.\" (Chalmers MS. n.)\nwritings, praise of the pure Giver is introduced as an adornment to\nthe book, whereas here, the book is adorned in order to the praise of\nthe Creator. In the pages of secularists, praise comes in as ancillary\nto the design of the book, but in this glorious history, the design is\nsubservient to the praise. According to the old method, God\u2019s praise\nwas effected by utterance; in this new rendezvous on Reason\u2019s highway,\naction is praise. My predecessors relied on speech for God\u2019s praise;\nin this exordium of rare writing, recourse is had to the perfect man\u00b9\nwho is a God-worshipping king, viz., that Lord of the World who,\nby virtue of his God-seeking and God-apprehending, has removed\nthe veil from between the external and the internal and has established\nlove between the sections of the recluse and the layman\u00b2 and has\nlifted up the curtain from in front\u00b3 of the apparent and the real.\n\nHeedlessness which used to travel on the opposite road to dis-\ncretion, has retraced his steps and become one of wisdom\u2019s servants.\nFormalism\u2074 which had left the regions of inquiry and was stirring\nup tumults, has now thrown inquiry\u2019s scarf on his shoulder and\nbecome a minister at the shrine. Blind self-worship which had\nabandoned the worship of God and adopted the worship of the\ncreature, has now got eyes to see with and has come, ashamed and\ndowncast, to the temple of divine worship.\n\nBlear-eyed envy which had megrim\u2075 in the head and madness\nin the brain, and used to strive against the Allwise Lawgiver, has\nnow got wisdom for his guide, and, having become enrolled as one\nof the pardoned of the shrine of grace,\u2076 has been ranked among\nthe helpers of the kingdom.

This\nis a Sufistic phrase and is explained\nby Jorj\u0101n\u012b. (Notices et Extraits X.\n386, Silvestre de Sacy.) The phrase\nperfect man does not mean simply an\nimpeccable person, in which sense\nthe expression was used, I believe,\nby Whitfield. It rather means the\nessence or highest type of humanity.\nIt is also explained as meaning the\nfirst intelligence, or,\u2014in Arabic\nphrase,\u2014the mother of the book.\nDe Sacy says \u201cL\u2019homme parfait est\nla m\u00eame chose que la premi\u00e8re intel-\nligence.\u201d (See also Bad\u0101oni, Lowe\n266).\n\u2074 \u062a\u0642\u0644\u064a\u062f, taql\u012bd, imitation and also\nhypocrisy and superstition.\n\u2075 \u0645\u062e\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0629, makh\u0101lifa, i.e., the\nGreek \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03b1.\n\u2076 \u0623\u064a\u0629, \u2018a\u2018y\u0101, gift or benefi-\ncence.\nof Eternity\u2014from being cripple has become a courier, and appears both as the runner and the winning-post. And why should this not be when we have, in this enlightened age, the chamber-lamp of the universe, the glory of Adam\u2019s race, the unveler of hidden secrets, the revealer of faultless forms? Or how should these things appear strange in the eyes of the far-seeing and wise, when he is (at once) composer (n\u0101\u1e93im) of the institutes of sovereignty, distributor of the riches of the servants of God, hairsplitting discerner of microscopic subtleties, the great lapidary and assaymaster?\n\nSo long as the spiritual supremacy over the recluse which is called Holiness and the sway over laymen which is called Sovereignty, were distinct, there was strife and confusion among the children of Noah (mankind). Now that in virtue of his exaltation, foresight, comprehensive wisdom, universal benevolence, pervading discernment and perfect knowledge of God, these two great offices (mans\u0101b) which are the guiding thread of the spiritual and temporal worlds, have been conferred on the opener of the hoards of wisdom and claviger of Divine treasuries, a small portion at least,\u2014if his holy nature grant the necessary faculty,\u2014may be brought from the ambush of concealment to the asylum of publicity. Knowest thou at all who is this world-girdling luminary and radiant spirit? Or whose august advent has bestowed this grace? \u2019Tis he who by virtue of his enlightenment and truth, is the world-protecting\n\n1 The meaning is not that Akbar was the almoner of God\u2019s servants, in which respect he was indeed, according to B\u0101d\u0101oni, very deficient, but that he revealed spiritual mysteries as well as made rules for temporal administration. The word, q\u0101sim, lit. divider, reminds us of St. Paul\u2019s phrase \u201crightly dividing the word of truth.\u201d In this group of four epithets, the first and the third relate apparently, to temporal matters and the second and fourth, to spiritual.\n\n2 Noah is called by Muhammadians, the second Adam.\n\n3 A. F.\u2019s panegyric on Akbar is an extraordinary production, according to our western ideas. Probably, however, it was thought very fine by his countrymen. The original is full of paronomasia and parallelisms and these, as also the alliterations and cadenced clauses, make the Persian sound much better than the translation. The composition must have cost the author immense labour, though apparently, the task was not entirely his own, for in Faiz\u012b\u2019s preface to his Diw\u0101n we find the epithets here bestowed on Akbar, from mugarrub down to \u2018\u0101lamj\u0101n \u016b j\u0101n \u2018\u0101lam, i.e., for about eight lines of the text, and nearly in the same order.\nsovereign of our age, to wit, that Lord (Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h) of the hosts of sciences,\u2014theatre of God's power,\u2014station of infinite bounties,\u2014unique of the eternal temple,\u2014confidant\\(^1\\) of the da\u012bs of unity,\u2014jewel of the imperial mine,\u2014bezel of God's signet-ring,\u2014glory of the G\u016brg\u0101n\\(^2\\) family,\u2014lamp of the tribe of Timur,\\(^3\\)\u2014lord of incomparable mystery,\u2014heir of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's throne,\u2014origin\\(^4\\) of the canons of world-government,\u2014author of universal conquest,\u2014shining forehead of the morning of guidance,\u2014focus\\(^5\\) of the sun of holiness,\u2014sublime\\(^6\\) concentration of humanity,\u2014heir-apparent of the sun,\u2014anthology of the books of fate and destiny,\u2014protagonist of triumphant armies,\u2014quintessence of the commingling of nights and days,\u2014cream of the progeny of the elements\\(^7\\) and the heavenly bodies,\u2014world's eye (sun) of benevolence and bounty,\u2014cheek-mole\n\nIn the Fundgruben des Orients (II. 271), may be found an interesting experiment, made by Joseph von Hammer, at preserving the oriental cadences in a German translation of the Turkish Hum\u0101y\u016bn-n\u0101ma.\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0628\u064f, muqarrob, said to be from the same root as cherub and to mean, like it, one who is admitted or near to God's presence, but the preferable opinion is that cherub is derived from the Chaldei and means the winged man-bull.\n\n\\(^2\\) G\u016brg\u0101n is said to mean son-in-law or near relation in Mongolian; (Blochmann 460n.) it was a title taken by Timur to indicate his connection with the house of Cingiz Kh\u0101n.

The three successive epithets are used in order to indicate that Akbar was, first, the glory of the house of Cingiz Kh\u0101n; second, the lamp of the house of Timur; third, the heir of Hum\u0101y\u016bn; and they lead up to a description of what he was in himself.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Bib.

There is a saying that when the rain of the month of Nais\u0101n drops into shells, it produces pearls, and when it falls into the mouths of serpents, it produces poison. See Whinfield\u2019s Gulshan-i-r\u0101s (57).\n\n4 The first month of the Persian year, corresponding to March-April.

There is here probably an allusion to \u0100in No. 5 (Blochmann, Book I. 18), where we are told that Akbar had invented modes of purifying gold.\n\n\\(^2\\) Qalb-i-zar and\u016bd az zar-i-goharam\u016bd.

The word also means restitution or restoration of property, and we might give this meaning here and interpret the phrase to signify that Akbar releases debtors from the obligation of restitution which lies like a veil over their faces. But I think that the translation contumacy is right and that there is an antithesis between this and the following clause. A. F. means that Akbar compelled the contumacious to fulfil their obligations, i.e., made them pay their fines, taxes, compensations for injuries and other debts but that, at the same time, he was forgiving to offenders. See \u0100in No. 2 (Blochmann, Book II. 13), with the account of the distinction between exchequer-lands and fiefs. See also \u0100in No. 19 (Blochmann Book II., 268).\n\n\\(^4\\) \u0641\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0645, fines or mulcts or debts. There are two \u0101ins devoted to the subject of fines, viz., Nos. 48 and 57 (Blochmann, Book I. 131 and 140) one being headed \u063a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a and the other \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9. No. 564 explains the word \u0641\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u0645 by \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9. Even grandees were fined and for certain offences elephant-drivers were liable to capital punishment. See Blochmann's note to \u0100in No. 83 (217). For tajabbur, the B. M. MS. Or. No. 6544 has \u0635\u0628\u0631, writing, and Chalmers' MS. seems to have had this reading for he translates, \"He tears the screen of writing from the face of his intent.\" Apparently, as Mr. Beames has suggested to me, Chalmers read \u0639\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0645, intentions, instead of \u063a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a.\n\n\\(^5\\) Lit. tongues of light. The two clauses are opposed; in spite of his benevolence, he is terrible; in spite of his wrath, he is lovely. Orientals regard lightning as an object of beauty rather than of terror.\nof the age is the impress of the wrinkling of his brows; its expansion the reflex of his nature's blossoming.\n\nPrayers for his permanence have stationed themselves on the tongue of small and great; love and belief in him repose in the hearts of young and old; the loftiness of his fame has lowered the glory of local magnates; the majesty of his dominion has put away the rulers of the quarters of the world; the echo of his fortune has opened the ears of the princes of the horizons; the ensign\\(^1\\) of his glory has lifted up the eyes of provincial kings;\\(^2\\) his mighty fame has mingled with the spheres; the sound of his glory has passed from shore to shore; the proclamation of his bounty has transgressed the boundaries of the world;\\(^3\\) his glorious court has become the native land of the elect of the seven climes; his daily increasing dominion has become the masterpiece of epochs and cycles; his glorious ascension, the auspicious frontispiece of stars and planets.\n\n**Verse.**\n\nThat King of Kings, prop of the sky!\nThe umbrella of his fortune is the sky's shadow;\nAdorning the garden-plot of wisdom and knowledge;\nExalting the throne and the diadem;\nThe seat of his power is rich in liberality;\nHis fortune's shape has an open brow;\nHis presence is the truth-seekers' cynosure;\nHis pity a fountain-head for the thirsty;\nBy a single thought,\\(^4\\) he has placed under foot\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0643\u0648\u0643\u0628\u0629, kuukaba, a steel ball suspended to a pole and carried as an ensign.

The world is also called \u0634\u0634\u0631\u064a \u0634\u0634\u0631\u064a, shashari, six-doored.\n\n\\(^4\\) Or it may be, \"He has placed under the foot of unanimity.\" The meaning is that he has united sovereignty and sanctity.\nThe royal divan and the dervish's carpet.\nThe nine heavens revolve for his purpose;\nThe seven stars travel for his work;\nBy wisdom, he is the age's provider;\nBy vigilance, the world's watchman;\nHis love and his hate, in the banquet and the battle,\nAre brimming cups of wine and blood;\nThe kh\u0101q\u0101n fears his wrath;\nC\u00e6sar is disturbed at his frown;\nHeaven in glory, Earth in stability;\nLord of universal reason, Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn.\nEssence of sunlight and shadow of God,\nPearl of crown and throne is Akbar Sh\u0101h.\nMay this old world be renewed by him!\nMay his star be the sun's rays!\n\nThis empty-handed one, who, from lack of the capital of praise,\nhad neither room to sit nor a leg to stand upon, became, through\nthe above excellent idea and firm resolve, a treasury full of the\nCreator's praise; a marvellous treasury,\u2014for its store increased by\nexpenditure and diminished by hoarding.

There is a similar passage in the \u0100in (III. 249,\n1.12).\n2 Great Kh\u0101n, the name given to the ruler of Chinese Tartary or of\nChina.\n3 The two titles stand for the rulers of the East and West. Turkish\nkings, e.g. B\u0101yaz\u012bd Ilderim, were styled Qaisar-i-r\u016bm even before the\ncapture of Constantinople. The lines are perhaps Faiz\u012b's. Cf. his Nal\nDaman. Bombay, 1831, p. 30. The literal rendering of the lines is \"The\nKh\u0101q\u0101n dreads the heat of his sweat; C\u00e6sar is disturbed at the fold of his\nbrow.\"\n4 A. F. did not know of the Copernican theory.\n5 'Aql-i-kull, the phrase used by Sufis to express the Logos or first\nemanation from God.\n6 One of Akbar's names, \"the glory of faith.\"\nfor entering upon this great task, yet, as my aim was lofty and ability small, success was not attained nor my desire achieved until this light shone on the antechamber of my truth-reflecting heart; to wit\u2014\"In this noble enterprise, at the same time that you dis-\n\"charge your duty to the creature, you are also fulfilling your\n\"obligations to the Creator. While you are paying your devoirs of\n\"respect and gratitude, you are in reality, steadfastly engaged in\n\"praising God, the Creator of the world.\" Day by day, my pur-\npose was growing confirmed and the materials of success were being\ncollected, until at length, out of general good-will to the partakers\nof his felicity and from special favour to me, his charmed one,\u00b9 a ray\nof intimation from the court of liberality reached this\u2014as regards\nhis sincerity,\u2014forerunner on the highway of loyalty, but\u2014as regards\nattainment\u00b2 of desires,\u2014hindernost (member) of the caravans of\n\nattributes; 2. praise of his majesty\nand perfection; 3. his feasts and his\nwars; 4. his holiness and pleasant\nways. But this seems wrong and to\nbe partially occasioned by an errone-\nous reading. The text and one or\ntwo MSS. have t\u0101 haqq-i-'ab\u016bd\u012byat\n\u016b ir\u0101dat-i-wali ni'mat guz\u0101rda\nb\u0101sham. But nearly all the MSS.\nhave ir\u0101dat \u016b ni'mat, missing out\nthe wali and this appears the true\nreading. We thus have three duties\nor points, viz., worship, loyalty and\ngratitude which with the duty to\nposterity, make up the four points.\nThe text, however, may be correct\nand the points be made up by regard-\ning the \"newcomers\" and posterity\nas two distinct classes. The word\nhaqqi in the phrase \u016b ham haqqi bar\nnur\u016bs\u0101n, probably has two meanings,\nviz., duty towards posterity and the\nestablishment of a claim by the\nauthor to the gratitude of posterity.\nThe phrase haqqi g\u0101bit gard\u0101nida\nis evidently used in antithesis to\nthe haqq guz\u0101rda. Chalmers ren-\nders the passage \"establish rectitude\nin the tender saplings of mortality\nand in the travellers of the caravans\nof existence.\" All these, however,\nwere only duties towards or rights\nof the creature and so not sufficient\nto excite our author till he saw\nthat in performing them, he would\nalso be doing his duty to his\nCreator.\n\n\u00b9 In n\u0101zarkarda-i-khud, lit. this\none upon whom his glance had fallen,\ni.e., his gazed one, prot\u00e9g\u00e9 or client.\nSee \u0100in I. 24, for use of n\u0101zarkarda,\nA.

The reference seems to be to the symbolical caps worn by dervishes (\"The Dervishes.\" J. P. Brown. Tr\u00fcbner, 1868, pp. 53, 88, 148). Speaking of the order of \"Bektashees,\" Mr. Brown says (148) \"T\u0101j is the name of the cap which all wear in common. It is made of white felt and is in four parts. The first shows that the wearer has given up the world; the second that he has abandoned all hopes of Paradise; the third that he disdains all hypocrisy and (it) means that the dervish cares not whether he is seen or not, praying, and is wholly indifferent to public opinion; the fourth is the total abandonment of all the pleasures of life and that he belongs to and is fully satisfied with Allah alone. Their names also are Sheere'at, Tareekat, Hakeekat and Ma'vi-fat.\" Tark means a segment, section or gore and also a string and a helmet. The Lucknow editor says that the four tarks signify the four elements, but this is doubtful. Tark has also the sense of abandonment and dervishes mean, by their tarks, the abandonment of the world, etc. The sect known as the Qadiriya, wear a fourfold cap, i.e., one with four tarks. This may signify the abandonment of this world, of the next, of respect of men and, fourthly, of every thing except God. A. F. may also be referring to the four degrees of devotion mentioned by Blochmann (A. F.'s Preface vn.) and by Bad\u0101oni (Lowe, 299 and 314) and which consisted in the surrender of four things, viz., Goods, Life, Fame, Faith. Hence the appropriateness of the word cah\u0101r-tark\u012b, as this may be rendered the four abandonments or surrenders. Ir\u0101dat too may mean desire and inclination, as well as devotion and discipleship so that the whole phrase may signify the cap of the fourfold abandonment of desires. It is in such many-sided expressions that the author delights.\n\nWriting of Maulavis, Kaempfer in his valuable work on Persian customs, \"Amoenitates Exoticae\" says, (p. 113), \"In vestitu nil peregrini habent, nisi mitram quatuor conspicuam plicie, ex fastigio ad oram decurrentibus.\"\n\n\\(^3\\) \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0647\u064e\u0641\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0637\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0632\u064d \u0639\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0647\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064c\n\n\"\u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0647\u064e\u0641\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0637\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0632\u064d \u0639\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064e\u062a\u0650 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0647\u064e\u062f\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064c\n\nAst\u0101n-i-haft-tar\u0101z-i-aqidat bar haqda haz\u0101r '\u0101lam afs\u0101handa, lit., whose seven-broidered sleeve of devotion has been shed over the 18,000 species. Seven is a mystic number and there may here be a reference to the seven valleys of the Man\u1e63\u016bru-t-\u1e6d\u0101'ir of Far\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn 'Att\u0101r. The seven broideries may mean embroidery in seven different colours and be typical\nand of our dominion-increasing victories.\" What shall I say was the effect of this order for describing the occurrences? Did it grant permission to undertake the task by bestowing on me the necessary genius? or did it, by a grant of felicity to my heart, appoint me the\n\nof the seven Paths, etc. See Brown l.c. 98. \u0100st\u012bn afsh\u0101ndan means to applaud by clapping the hands, to dance, and to scatter gifts. It also has the contrary meaning of abandoning or refusing. See Vullers and the Burh\u0101n-i-q\u0101fi s.v. A.F. seems here to play upon these meanings, but his primary intention probably was to signify that he was renowned throughout the world for his devotion. Chalmers perhaps read anish\u0101nda or nish\u0101nda and translates \"who was renowned among the 18,000 creatures for the seven times embroidered sleeve of trustiness.\" Perhaps we might translate, \"whose seven embroidered sleeve of loyalty has showered gifts over the 18,000 species,\" or, without the is\u0101fat\u2014\"Whose seven-broidered sleeve has showered loyalty over the 18,000 species.\"\n\nIt would seem that the language was originally Faiz\u012b's, for we find it in the preface to his translation of the L\u012bl\u0101vati (B.M. MSS. Or. No. 5649, p. 4). It is also in the printed edition of his translation. (Calcutta 1828, p. 2).\n\nIn the MS. the phrase runs thus:\n\nBanda-i-kamtarin-i-darg\u0101h-i-sa\u02bf\u0101dat \u0101 gam kh\u0101k-nishin-i-\u0101st\u0101n-i-ir\u0101dat Faiz\u012b ki kul\u0101h-i-cah\u0101r-tark\u012b-i-gh\u0101l\u0101s-i-cah\u0101r-g\u014dsha bar sar-i-dil m\u0101nda \u0101\n\n\u0101st\u012bn-i-haft-tar\u0101s-i-aq\u012bd\u0101t bar h\u0101zda h\u0101z\u0101r \u012bl\u0101m afsh\u0101nda.\n\nIt should be remembered that Faiz\u012b projected writing an Akbar-n\u0101ma on the model of the B\u0101ri-sikandarn\u0101ma of Niz\u0101mi and that he, apparently, had begun its composition (Ingh\u0101 III). It is probable that some of A.F.'s most flowery passages are borrowed from his brother's incomplete poem.\n\nPossibly the expression about the 18,000 species, has reference to A.F.'s oft repeated assertions that he had arrived at the state of sul\u016bk-i-kull, perfect peace with all men. It may be noted that the sleeve mentioned is the wide sleeve of the Oriental which may be opened out and folded over the face. The expression sleeve of devotion has nothing in common with Shakespeare's \"ravelled sleeve of care,\" where sleeve means an entangled skein.\n\nThe simplest rendering of the whole passage is something like this;\u2014\"Mub\u0101rak's son, Abu-l-fa\u1e63l, in whose heart dwell the four Renunciations, and the praise of whose sevenfold devotion has gone out to the ends of the earth.\"\n\nI think this must be the meaning, though the phrase might mean \"What shall I say? Was this a command for me to compose the memoirs?\" as Chalmers has translated it. The objection to this rendering is that we have just been told he had received a clear order.\nrecorder of glorious events? or did it bestow eloquence on one rude of speech? Nay! nay! it gave wings to my words and feet to my pen. It was an invisible angel, conveying from the upper world, life-giving news of joy. It was the Archangel Gabriel bringing down a revelation from the antechamber of Omnipotence.\n\nAssuredly, I spent much labour and research in collecting the records and narratives of his Majesty's actions and I was a long time interrogating the servants of the State and the old members of the illustrious family. I examined both prudent, truth-speaking old\n\n1. Chalmers seems to have read 'ajam\u012b, 'ajam\u012b and so translates sab\u0101n-i-'ajam\u012b, the Persian tongue. This is also the reading of the Lucknow ed. but a'jam\u012b seems to be right. A. F. speaks of his having a stammering tongue, kaj-maj sab\u0101n. (\u0100in II, 254).\n\n2. n\u0101m\u016bs-i-akbar, lit. the chief confidant of God. (Dozy 272b). A. F. also uses this phrase to mean reason. (\u0100in I, 13). No doubt it is used here partly for the play upon the word Akbar. In a Circular Order preserved in the Insh\u0101' (Part I,) we have the phrase N\u0101m\u016bs-i-akbar \u016b q\u0101n\u016bn-i-\u0101'jam-i-sult\u0101nat.\n\n3. See for another account of the inception of the task and of his labours, the conclusion of the \u0100in (Jarrett, 400\u2013417).\n\n\u2022 Princess Gulbadan, the sister of Hind\u0101l, aunt of Akbar, and widow of Khizr Khw\u0101ja, wrote her Memoirs in accordance with Akbar's request and apparently as material for the Akharn\u0101ma (Rieu's Catalogue I, 227a. and MS. Or. No. 166). Her little book, called apparently the Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u0101ma, gives interesting details about Hum\u0101y\u016bn's marriage with Akbar's mother and deserves publication and translation. She mentions that she was eight years old when her father B\u0101bar died.\n\nIn the India Office, there is a MS. (No. 216) called the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hum\u0101y\u016bn which was composed by Akbar's orders for the use of A. F. It was dictated by B\u0101yaz\u012bd, who had been M\u012br S\u0101m\u0101n, steward or superintendent of the kitchen, under Hum\u0101y\u016bn to a clerk of Abu-l-fa\u017cl at Lahor. An examination of the book does not show that the author called it the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hum\u0101y\u016bn, and such a title would be inadequate. Apparently the only name given to it by the author is that of Mukhtasar (Abridgment). It is in fact a book of Memoirs and comes down to the date of writing, vis., 999 (1590). It begins in 949 (1542), with Hum\u0101y\u016bn's flight to Persia, and is a personal narrative of events from that date. Many events in Akbar's reign are described, e.g., the murder of Shamsu-d-d\u012bn by Adham Kh\u0101n (105 a and b) and Khw\u0101ja Muazzim's murder of his wife. (105b and 106a).\n\nA valuable feature of the book is its lists of officers, especially the long one of those who accompanied Hum\u0101y\u016bn to India. The author was Bak\u0101wal Beg\u012b (Superintendent of the Kitchen)\nmen and active-minded, right-actioned young ones and reduced their statements to writing. The royal commands were issued to the provinces, that those who from old service remembered, with certainty or with adminicle of doubt, the events of the past, should copy out their notes and memoranda and transmit them to Court. Inasmuch as this auspicious invitation was not fully responded to nor my wish fully accomplished, a second command shone forth from the holy Presence-chamber; to wit\u2014that the materials which had been collected, should be faired out and recited in the royal hearing, and that whatever might have to be written down afterwards, should be introduced into the noble volume as a supplement, and that such details as on account of the minuteness of the inquiries and the minutiae of affairs, could not then be brought to an end, should be inserted afterwards at my leisure. Being relieved by this royal order,\u2014the interpreter of the Divine ordinance,\u2014from the secret\n\nin Akbar's time, and his full name appears to be B\u0101yaz\u012bd Sult\u0101n (1586 last line). He was attached to Mun'im Kh\u0101n and has many details about K\u0101bul and the war in Bengal. Nine copies of the work were made, viz., two (including one that got mislaid) for the King's Private Library, three for the Royal Princes, one for the library of Gulbadan whom the author calls the mother of the king's servants, and two for Abu-l-fa\u017cl's library. The ninth was probably the original, and remained with the author.\n\nB\u0101yaz\u012bd, known as B\u0101yaz\u012bd B\u0101yat, is quoted by Raverty (Notes on Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n) and the B. M. has a MS. (Add. No. 26, 610) which contains an apparently complete trs. of B\u0101yaz\u012bd's Memoirs by Erskine. (Rieu's Cat. II. Pref. XX). Both text and trs. merit publication.\n\n1 Apparently far\u016b guz\u0101\u0161tan here means to complete or bring to an end and not, to neglect or pass over.\n\nSee Vullers s. v. guz\u0101\u0161tan, 954b and the quotation there given from the Burh\u0101n-i-g\u0101ti. With regard to this account of the collection of materials, it should be remembered that the \u0100in with all its wealth of tables and other statistics is part of the Akbar-n\u0101ma and that the author was probably referring to his difficulties in getting full topographical details. What he seems here to mean is that he was disturbed in his mind at not getting full answers to his inquiries for local information and that Akbar relieved him by telling him to set to work on the material he had, and to leave other details to be inserted afterwards. We have (\u0100in II. 14, Jarrett III. 23) the skeleton of an elaborate astronomical table which appears to be blank in all the MSS. Colonel Jarrett supposes that the entries were left to be made at a later time and that the matter was afterwards forgotten or the required information never obtained.\nanxiety of my heart, I proceeded to reduce into writing the rough draughts which were void of the graces of arrangement and style. I obtained the chronicle of events beginning at the nineteenth year 10 of the Divine Era, when the Record Office\\(^1\\) was established by the enlightened intellect of his Majesty, and from its rich pages I gathered the accounts of many events. Great pains too, were taken to procure originals or copies of most of the orders\\(^2\\) which had been issued to the provinces from the Accession up to the present day which is the dawn of Fortune's morning.\\(^3\\) Their sacred contents yielded much material for the sublime volume. I also took much trouble to incorporate many of the reports which ministers and high officials had submitted, about the affairs of the empire and the events of foreign countries.\\(^4\\) And my labour-loving soul was satiated by the apparatus of inquiry and research. I also exerted myself energetically to collect the rough notes and memoranda of sagacious and well-informed men. By these means, I constructed a reservoir\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u060c q\u0101n\u016bn-i-w\u0101qi-'a-naw\u012b. (Blochmann 258, \u0100in No. 10). There were 14 clerks employed in the Office, viz., two for each day. It was established in the 19th year, 982 (1574). (\u0100kbarn\u0101ma III. 118).\n\nIn the same year A. F. entered the Emperor's service and we may reasonably suppose that the institution of the Record Office was partly due to his suggestion.\n\n\\(^2\\) Two dast\u016br-ul-'amal (Circulars) to the local authorities are preserved in the first volume of Insh\u0101 and much of them (with modifications and additions) is to be found in the \u0100in (Jarrett II. 37, 68, etc.).\n\n\\(^3\\) We might here have expected A. F. to use this language with reference to the Accession and not to delay the \"dawn of fortune's morning\" till 40 years of the reign had passed away. But clearly he refers it to the time of his writing. There is a similar passage in Akbar's letter to 'Abdu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n of T\u0101r\u0101n. (\u0100kbarn\u0101ma III. 707, l. 8) where the phrase is used with reference to the 41st year and apparently to the completion of the conquest of the Deccan and the establishment of universal peace.\n\n\\(^4\\) This passage might be copiously rendered Home and Foreign Affairs. The phrase used for foreign countries is Akn\u0101f-i-wil\u0101yat, borders of foreign countries. Blochmann says (Prosody of the Persians, VI.) that wil\u0101yat, in Indian prose writers and poets, means K\u0101bul and Persia, and it is possible that Persia is intended here. But I should think T\u0101r\u0101n and Europe were also referred to. A. F. would not be likely to speak of K\u0101bul as wil\u0101yat because he regarded it as part of the empire and has described it among the \u0161\u016bbas.\nAKBARINA.\n\nopening the rose garden of fortun-\nding all this apparatus and these ru-\nHouse of History! was become a\nare were contradictions and imperi-\nficient means of clearing up difficul-\nthat I had heard from his Majesty\nory, recollects every occurrence in\nwas one year old\u2014when the n\n\u2014till the present day when he is\nstrating truth-seekers.

No. 117 has a curious addition to the account of the mandate (ante 27) which A. F. received to write the history of Akbar's achievements. After afsh\u0101nda, it has \"Dar bist-\u016b-d\u016byam Isfand\u0101rmaz m\u0101h, sana si-\u016b-siyum-i-Il\u0101hi \u1e25ukm shud,\" etc. \"On 22nd Isfand\u0101rmaz, 33rd of the Divine Era, an order was given.\" Lower down where it is stated that a second commandment was issued (ante page 29) the same MS. has \"Dar r\u016bz isn\u0101d Ardibihisht sana si-\u016b-cah\u0101rum ki siyum Rajab nuh-sad-\u016b-nuwad-\u016b-haft \u1e25ukm mujadd shud.\" \"On 26th Ardibihisht of the 34th year, or 3rd Rajab 997, a second order was issued.\" I have not found these clauses in any other MS., but they are hardly likely to have been interpolated by the copyist and the first date appears to agree with A. F.'s other statements, for in the \u0100in (Jarrett III. 416) he says that he was seven years employed on the history which with the year or so occupied in the collection of materials might bring the completion of the work to the 41st or 42nd of Akbar.\n\n\u00b9 Miryam is Miriam or Mary and the epithet has been variously rendered\u2014she who dwells with Mary,\u2014is of the household of Mary,\u2014and who is of equal rank with Mary\u2014viz., the Virgin Mary. (The Virgin is one of Muhammad's four perfect women). Akbar did not invent the epithet, for it was borne by his great-grandmother, the mother of B\u0101bar. (See Khafi Kh\u0101n I. 35). Jah\u0101ng\u012br's wife, Jodh B\u0101i, was called Miryam-i-zam\u0101n\u012b, the Mary of the Age. I think the word Mak\u0101n\u012b, in \u1e24am\u012bda B\u0101n\u016b's title must be translated, rank or station, and not household, for it was given to her in her life-time. It almost looks as though Akbar liked the title because it agreed with his resemblance to the Messiah. It was said that the two resembled one another in speaking in the cradle. See account of miracle wrought by the infant Akbar to comfort Jij\u012b Anaga (Akbarn\u0101ma I. 187 and Dabist\u0101n III. 50, trs.). With reference to this incident A. F. calls Akbar Mas\u012b\u1e25\u0101w\u0101r, Messiah-like.\n\n\u00b2 Conqueror of the world, abidin in Paradise.\nCHAPTER I.\n\nACCOUNT OF SUNDRY SECRET ANNUNCIATIONS AND HOLY MANIFESTATIONS WHICH TOOK PLACE BEFORE HIS MAJESTY'S AUSPICIOUS BIRTH.\n\nIt is not hidden from the mirror-hearts of the quick-sighted and far-seeing\u2014who know the mysteries of truth, and who show forth the secrets behind the divine veils, and are curtain-openers of elemental (i.e., terrestrial and celestial) mysteries\u2014that the profound wisdom and secret power of the Creator ordain that it is by the weddings of heavenly sires with earthly mothers, and after various cycles of lunar aspects, and of applications, of syzygies and oppositions of the sun and moon, of conjunctions of the superior and inferior planets, risings and settings, appearances and disappearances of stars, lunar and solar eclipses, qualities of exaltations and falls, influences of zeniths and nadirs, and the like, (which are architects in the workshop of production and change, and artists in the picture-gallery of invention and contrivance) that the unique one comes forth from the secret inner chambers into the palace of manifestation,\n\n1 Chalmers breaks off here, and does not resume his translation till page 102 of the text.\n\n2 The author here displays his learning by giving a string of astronomical and astrological terms. The planets and other heavenly bodies are the sires, and the four elements are the earthly mothers, though the latter may also be \"elect ladies,\" such as Alang-gos (Alanq\u016bd\u0101) and Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b.\n\n3 \u0627\u0645\u062a\u0632\u0627\u062c, imtiz\u0101j, union or mixture; but it appears to be also a term for the lunar aspects. See Dic. of T. T. 1323.\n\n4 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0644, itti\u1e63\u0101l, approximation or propinquity. It is an astrological term corresponding to the continuation or application of European astrologers and is the opposite of \u0646\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0641, insir\u0101f, separation.\n\n5 The superior planets are Saturn, Jupiter and Mars,\u2014as being above or beyond the orbit of the Sun,\u2014and the inferior are Venus, Mercury and the Moon.\n\n6 A planet falls when it is in the house and degree opposite to those of its exaltation, i.e., is six heavens, 180\u00b0, from them. Thus the Sun's exaltation is 19\u00b0 Aries and his fall 19\u00b0 Libra. The Sun is a planet, according to the Ptolemaic system.\n\n7 \u0627\u0648\u0686 \u0648 \u062d\u0636\u06cc\u0636, awj \u016b \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101.

Awj (Pers. awk or aug), was used to signify the apogee of a planet.\nand that Unity emerges from the veiled ones of the cabinet of non-existence and displays its glory in the sublime assembly of Being, to be the cause of the arrangement of the Universe and the means of discriminating between justice and oppression throughout the world. How can arrangement result from simple matter? How will it make progress when the constitution of every individual is founded on a collection of opposite tendencies, when there is colossal egotism in every brain, when justice is unattainable, love non-existent, appetite rampant, and concupiscence daily on the increase?\n\nThe wise and far-sighted man is aware that in every period it is indispensable that there be a ruler who shall be strengthened by God\u2019s help and made fortunate by eternal blessings. And the philosopher perceives that such a power must be spiritual as well as possessed of\n\n---\n\n1 \u062a\u064e\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u0650\u062f, tan-i-w\u0101hid. I understand this to signify matter only, i.e., simple matter without the intervention of celestial influences. The author has been dwelling on the necessity of all sorts of combinations and influences to produce the Only One\u2014the Unique,\u2014and then winds up by exclaiming about the impotence of mere matter. In the \u0100in (II. 966) the author uses \u062a\u064e\u0646, tan, in the sense of matter as opposed to spirit and has the phrase tan gud\u0101khtan, to mortify\u2014lit. to melt\u2014the flesh.\n\nI am, however, by no means sure of the meaning and possibly the phrase may, as has been suggested to me, be an exclamation of surprise at Akbar\u2019s greatness, \u201cWhat an apparatus of arrangement from one man!\u201d This rendering of tan-i-w\u0101hid receives support from the similar use of tan in page 4 (line 4 from foot); but then I do not see its connection with what follows. Possibly the correct reading would be to omit the i\u1e93\u0101fat after tan and to translate w\u0101hid as the Unique One. \u201cWhat Cosmos can come out of flesh? How can the Unique One issue from it, seeing that every man is made up of contradictions?\u201d See the corresponding passage in the \u0100in (I. 290 l.12, Jarrett II. 51) and also in the beginning of the first letter to \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n of T\u016br\u0101n, in the Insh\u0101. Here we have the expression qahr-i-wahdat which Jarrett translates autocracy. Finally I may point out that there is an Arabic word \u062a\u064e\u0646, tinn, signifying equality, and that possibly this is what A. F. wrote. His question then would be, \u201cHow can Cosmos result from equality (or equals)?

How many revolutions of epochs then, and how many cycles, are required before such a priceless pearl and unique jewel,\\(^2\\) lacking in naught, can obtain his special preparation, so that by ascending steps, he arrive at the fulness of perfection? Acute and experienced observers perceive that the length of the period is dependent on the number of the subjects,\\(^3\\) for the greater their number, the greater are the opposition and incommensurability. The greatness of the Lord of an Age is more conspicuous when he takes the burden of the whole world and of mankind on the head (farg) of genius, and guards the flocks (firq) of the universe from strife, and arranges and completes, by virtue of his wisdom, the work of the world and of mankind. But whenever, in the plenitude of His desires, the Divine Workman wills, that the arrangement of things spiritual and temporal and the culture of the inner and outer worlds be placed in the hands of one individual of the human race, how can the period of preparation of such a lofty comprehension and sublime intellect be calculated by the human understanding, and how can finite cycles contain it? Inasmuch as the enlightened and wise of our time find these two supreme gifts\\(^4\\) in the writing on the luminous forehead of the Lord\\(^5\\) of the World (Akbar), they quite justly admit their inability to expound his orbit.\\(^6\\) To them, this very fact is bliss, that by the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Alluding to the notion that the ruby is slowly developed from stone by the action of the Sun.

Here, I think, it means the path of Akbar's development, though A. F. probably has an eye to the double meaning of the word, as his manner is.\nDivine aid, they have come to know him. For the comprehension of the stages of development of such a Lord is not within the compass of human calculation. They know that in venerating this Great One, they are doing reverence to the Divine power and are worshipping the very Godhead. They spend all their energies in acquiring his grace, as that necessarily includes the compassing of the grace of the incomparable God. What bliss can be greater than this? Or what fortune can be more exquisite than this boon? And the enlightened and far-seeing man whose visual ray has been strengthened by the antimony of rectitude, knows from the analogy\\(^1\\) of an auspicious star, it was after thousands of years had been spent, womb after womb, in the cradle of preparation, that the broidery of existence was bestowed on her Majesty Alanqu\u0101,\\(^2\\) so that she might become\\(^3\\) worthy of that world-illuminating Light, which is the interpretation of that anthropomorphic Sun\\(^4\\) which stands at the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lit. by the guidance of an auspicious star but, I think, the verse quoted immediately afterwards, shows the meaning to be, that the length of time after which an auspicious star appears, proves how long a period is required for the development of a Light such as that of Akbar.\n\n\\(^2\\) Her proper name appears to be Alang-goa. See Ssanang-Ssetzen's \"History of the Eastern Mongols,\" (trs. J. J. Schmidt, St. Petersburg, 1829, 59). Goa or Go means white or shining and is a title given to noble ladies (l. c. 373). Ssanang-Ssetzen was a descendant of Cingiz Kh\u0101n and completed his book in 1662 (l. c. 299). He describes Alang-goa as the daughter of Baraghodschin-goa, wife of Choritai-mergen. She became the wife of Dobo-mergen and bore him two sons. Then her husband died, and during her widowhood, she was visited by the Sun and became by him, the mother of three sons. She is the mythical ancestress of the Mongolian race by her supernaturally-born son, Budantsar Mong Kh\u0101n. A. F. gives an account of her (Akbarn\u0101ma, 64). Both he and Ssanang-Ssetzen intimate that she was miraculously born as well as a miraculous mother, and the latter gives the name of her mother only.\n\n\\(^3\\) The word is gard\u012bd, became, but I think the past tense is used here for the future as is sometimes done in Persian. The elements of humanity traversed armies of martyrs,\u2014thereby becoming purified,\u2014and were eventually developed into Alanqu\u0101.\n\n\\(^4\\) \u0634\u0645\u0633\u200c\u067e\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646\u060c shamsa-i-pesh\u1e6d\u0101q. In \u0100in No. 19, (\u0100in, Book I. 45), A. F. treats of the insignia of royalty and begins with the expression shamsa-i-cah\u0101rt\u0101q. He then adds that this shamsa is a Divine splendour which, without the intervention of human effort is the finger-mark\nentrance-gate of ancient tradition and constitutes the basal inscrip-\n\nof Divine power. Blochmann (50) translates, \"The shamsa of the arch of royalty is a Divine light which God directly transfers to kings without the assistance of men, and kings are fond of external splendour because they consider it an image of the Divine glory.\" He adds, in a note, \"Shamsa is a picture of the Sun, affixed to the gates or walls of the palaces of kings. At night, these pictures are illuminated.\" The expression shamsa-i-cah\u0101rt\u0101q must be connected with that of shamsa-i-p\u0113sh\u1e6d\u0101q which occurs in the text (III. 184, 1.4). The expression there used is shamsa-i-p\u0113sh\u1e6d\u0101q-i-\u0101g\u0101h\u012b\u2014the solar image of the arch of intelligence\u2014and is applied to Akbar. Similarly Faiz\u012b, in the preface to his Diw\u0101n, speaks of the sham-i-shash\u1e6d\u0101q \u016b sh\u0101h-i-nuh-kharga\u2014meaning apparently, lamp of the six sides of the world and king of the nine vaults of heaven. Cah\u0101rt\u0101q which Blochmann translates arch is given by Steingass as meaning a kind of tent. Dozy (Supplement I. 786) defines shamsa as a round ornament or little ball in the shape of the Sun; he also says it is described as a sun-shaped button, by means of which a door is opened. It may apparently mean also a curtain or parasol. I think the shamsa-i-p\u0113sh\u1e6d\u0101q in the passage before us, means in part, the solar images which were set up at the entrance-gates of royal palaces and here, we may quote the words of Quintus Curtius (III. Cap. 7) noticed in Hyde's \"Religion of the Ancient Persians.\"\n\n\"Super tabernaculum unde ab omnibus conspici posset, imago solis crystallo inclusa fulgebat.\"\n\nPerhaps, however, this rather refers to the ak\u0101sdiya. (Blochmann 50).\n\nThe following extract from Kaempfer's Amoenitates Exoticae, (Fasciculus V. 199), gives a nobler idea of the Shamsa than Mr. Blochmann's description. Kaempfer is describing the Gynaecceum Regium or Female Apartments of the Palace at Ispahan.\n\n\"Ambulacri superat\u0101 longitudine (quam habet 150 passuum) portam contingimus primariam, extus, Janitoribus Sopi, intus, albis munitam spadonibus. Haec tota caeruleo imbuta, iconem exhibet Mithrae, i.e., Solis (detorta vox est ab obsoleto Meh\u012bn quod Solem notat) praegrandem, auream et sparse in orbem jubare radiantem. Sanctitatem loci, non alii ornamenti species, mystici gentis judicio, gravius exprimebat quam Mithra, sive Sol, qui coelo decus, universitati lux et vitae focus praepositus est. Solem igitur pro summo Numine (verius pro larv\u0101 Numinis) antiquitus colebat, ejusque simulacrum adoptabat absolutae potentiae suae insigne, quod et domi statuebat togatae Majestati praesidiun, et in Campo signis praeferebat militaribus ita animas accensurum objectu rei, quae uno quasi complexa Divini Numinis imaginem, et Majestatis Regiae praesentiam innueret.\"\n\nBut I think A. F. chiefly means to refer to the solar being who came into Alang-goas's tent and that he wishes to indicate as the true expla-\ntion of true histories. And he perceives that the same Light which took shape, without human instrumentality or a father's loins, in the pure womb of her Majesty \u0100lanq\u016b\u0101, after having, in order to arrive at perfection, occupied during several ages the bodily wrappings of other holy witnesses, is manifesting itself at the present day, in the pure entity of this unique God-knower and God-worshipper (Akbar).\n\nVERSE.\n\nHow many ages have passed away!\nHow many planetary conjunctions occurred,\nThat this happy star might come forth from heaven!\n\nIt is an ancient custom and established institute that the messengers of the eternal city and the heralds of the opening of the gates of munificence, before the appearance of an elect one,\u2014such\n\nnation of the mysterious figure which, according to the old tradition, came in as an image of the Sun and disappeared as a wolf,\u2014that Alang-goa was made pregnant by the Divine Light, in the same way as the Virgin Mary, (Akbarn\u0101ma 64, ff.). It is believed by some writers that the story of Alang-goa is an imitation of the accounts of the incarnations of the Buddha and of Jesus Christ.\n\n1 \u0645\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u060c kit\u0101ba-i-mab\u0101ni, epithet, inscription, foundation of (true records). I think the allusion must be to the title Nair\u016bn which was given to Alang-goa's descendants by the Sun. (Akbarn\u0101ma 67, l.l). A. F. takes the epithet to be derived from n\u016br and says it means light-born; but the word does not seem to be Arabic and it is not likely that the rude forefathers of the Mughals would use an Arabic term. D'Ohsson (I. 25) says, \"Nir\u016bn, c'est-\u00e0 dire de la c\u00f4te, pour d\u00e9signer la puret\u00e9 de leur origine.\" Apparently then, he does not derive the word from n\u016br but connects it with the Turk\u012b nar\u0101h, a side or place. The legend about Alang-goa is mentioned in the Shajratu-l-atr\u0101k. (Col. W. Miles' trs.) There may however, also, be a reference to the Tabag\u0101t-i-n\u0101\u1e63iri of Minh\u0101j-i-sir\u0101j, (Section XXI.) where the word Sham\u016ba is used as a title of a dynasty and where there is a passage not unlike A. F.'s. (Raverty 596 and Bib. Ind. Text 164). Possibly too, the word taw\u0101ri\u1e25 here means dates or chronology and the allusion (or at least, one of the allusions) is to the Divine Era, established by Akbar.\n\n2 \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0627\u0628\u064f\u060c fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101b. I learn from the Dic. of T. T. (1104) that this is also an astrological term, meaning the coming together in the same house of two planets whose mansions are opposite to one another, e.g., Saturn and the Sun and Moon, Jupiter and Mercury, Mars and Venus.

It is exceptionally suitable that a king who in succession to a line of ancestors is placed on a throne of rule and sway, and is world-dominating and world-adorning, should have an illustrious successor; and such an one is of all men, the most eager in this quest.\n\nAt length, on 4th Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal, 947, of the lunar (Hijra) era (Friday, 10 July, 1540) his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b had, after paying his devotions to the Author of bounty, laid for a time his head on the pillow of repose and his limbs on the couch of tranquility, when, suddenly, under the auspicious veil of sleep,\u2014hence called the cabinet of secrets\u2014he became aware that God, (Glory be to Him) was bestowing on him an illustrious successor whose greatness shone from his forelock, and the lightning of whose splendour was flashing from his temples. From the light of his guidance, the dark regions of thoughts and opinions were illuminated, and the glory of his justice was lighting up the fields of night and day. It is in accordance with the communication which was made by the messengers of the invisible world regarding his Majesty (Akbar) that the glorious name of that divine masterpiece exalts at the present day, pulpits and proclamations. The superscriptions\\(^1\\) of the gold and silver coins also tell of it.\n\nWhen his Majesty awoke, he first returned thanks to God for the majestic message and splendid grace and then told the circumstance to the intimates of his harem and the servants of his threshold.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lit. the faces of the dirhams and din\u0101rs.

Akbar gave new names to the coins.\n\n\\(^2\\) This dream occurred about a year before Hum\u0101y\u016bn's marriage with Akbar's mother. That marriage took place, according to Gulbadan, on Monday, (D\u014dghamba) 9th Jun\u0101da-l-awwal 948. Gulbadan says the dream occurred at Lahore, and she gives a more poetical account of it. She says Ahmad-i-j\u0101m himself appeared in a dream, as an old man dressed in green and with a staff in his hand, to Hum\u0101y\u016bn when the latter was in great distress on account of the conflicts with Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n, and bade him not lose heart, for he would have a wonderful son whom he was to call Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar. Bibi Konor (qu. G\u016bnawar) was then pregnant and it was thought that she would have a son, but she bore a daughter, Bakhsh\u012b Ban\u016b.\nVerse.\n\nA sleep which tore the veil from before the eyes of the soul,\nCannot be called sleep; it was the heart's waking.\n\nSharif Kh\u0101n related that when his brother Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Mu.\nKh\u0101n Atga was in Ghazn\u012b, in the 22nd year of his age, he dreamt\nhe saw the moon come into his arms. He related the fact to his\nvenerable father M\u012br Y\u0101r Mu. Ghaznav\u012b who was a spiritually-\nminded householder, and the latter rejoiced at the happy appearance\nof the auspicious circumstance and interpreted it to mean that God\nwould, one day, bestow a great privilege upon him which would be\nthe means of exalting their family. And so it turned out, for by\nthe blessings of that full Moon of glory of the heaven (Akbar) the\nfamily was raised from the nadir of the dust to the zenith of heaven.\n\nAnother circumstance was communicated by religious, right-\nthinking persons, viz. that when her Highness Miryam Mak\u0101n\u012b\u2014may\nthe shadows of her glory be eternal\u2014was pregnant with the holy\nelements of his Majesty, a strange light was perceptible from her\nbright brows. Often her divine countenance had to observers, the\nappearance of mirrors such as are fastened by tirewomen near the\ntemples of secluded chaste ones.\n\nAnd the star of fortune sang this strain with the tongue of ecstasy.\n\nVerse.\n\nI placed the clouded brow on the path of fortune,\nI hung a thousand mirrors on the forehead.\n\n---\n\n1 These lines are Faiz\u012b's and occur in his Diw\u0101n.

Possibly the word is bur\u0101 and the translation should be, \"I laid the ornament of fortune on the clouded brow.\"\nOne day, near the time\\(^1\\) of the auspicious birth, her Highness Miryam Mak\u0101n\u012b was riding\\(^2\\) on a camel. On the way, her eye fell on a mango-garden.

The Khw\u0101ja brought some, and was giving them into her blessed hand when he saw a light upon her glorious brows like that from a mirror. He said, \u201cHave you put a mirror on your forehead?\u201d She replied, \u201cI have not attached any mirror. What are you referring to?\u201d Then the Khw\u0101ja looked narrowly and saw that her Highness\u2019 shining forehead was lighted by the light of God. He marvelled at the light eternal and mentioned the circumstance to several of the confidential courtiers. His statement was to the effect, that the glory of the divine light so streamed from the shining brows that he had not strength to gaze steadily at it.\n\nThe venerable mother of Kh\u0101n A\u2018zam M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Az\u012bz Kokalt\u0101sh, who was his Majesty\u2019s nurse,\\(^4\\) related the following anecdote. \u201cOne morning, before I had the good fortune to hold this supreme office, a great light approached me and entered my bosom.

The Ma\u2018\u0101\u1e63ir (I. 618) describes the Khw\u0101ja as bar\u0101dar-i-a\u2018y\u0101n\u012b of Miryam Mak\u0101n\u012b, i.e., her full brother. Its author then, apparently, took akhy\u0101t to mean full brother.\n\nNiz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn (Tabaq\u0101t, Luck. ed. 263) speaks of the Khw\u0101ja as Akbar\u2019s maternal uncle and as the son of \u2018Al\u012b Akbar, a descendant of the saint Ahmad-i-j\u0101m. The Khw\u0101ja was a man of violent temper, if not wholly insane. He killed his wife and was imprisoned by Akbar in Gwalior. (Bad\u0101oni, Lowe, 71 and Noer\u2019s Akbar, A. S.

And\nfrom the time of that white dawn of the morning of majesty and\nbeauty and rose-blooming of fortune and glory, I was on the watch,\nthinking, 'O God! what will be the result of this sublime feeling?'\nAt length, I was exalted to this lofty service which is the treasure\nof realm and religion (din \u00fb d\u00fbny\u00e2) and of trust.\"\n\nHEMISTICH.\n\n\"Fortune\\(^1\\) is what comes to our bosom without trouble.\"\n\n\"God be praised! What a blessing it was that came to my\nbosom and what a fortune was received within my breast.\nThough externally, I was strongly made for the service of that\nsublimely-born pearl, yet in reality, it was Fortune who inclined her\nface\\(^2\\) towards me and supported me and my family. Whenever\nI took his Majesty on my shoulder, auspiciousness raised me from\nthe dust. Accordingly, by the blessing of this service which was\ndestined for me, a great grace and a lucky star were conferred on me.\nAnd I and my family became famous throughout the seven climes.\"\n\nAnother story was told by Maul\u00e2n\u00e2\\(^3\\) N\u00fbru-d-d\u00een Tarkh\u00e2n\nand some others who were in attendance on the Court, viz., that near the\nemergence of the sun of fortune (Akbar), his Highness Jah\u00e2nb\u00e2n\u00ee was\nrecreating himself in a room\\(^4\\) which had latticed windows, and the\nformula of the rectification\\(^5\\) of the glorious birth was before him.\n\n---\n\n1 This line is in the Anw\u00e2r-i-Suhail\u00ee (Cap. 14, Story 2). The literal rendering is \"Fortune is what comes into the bosom without the heart's blood\" (being shed), and the nurse uses the line to indicate that she had not to undergo the pain and danger of parturition.\n\n2 There is an antithesis between her strong back, push\u00ee-i-qaw\u00ee and Fortune's face.\n\n3 See Blochmann 524 and 541, also long account in Bad\u00f4n\u00ee (III. 197-200) and the Ma'\u00e2q\u00eer (I. 478).

The nam\u00fbd\u00e2r was a device for obtaining the date of birth. There is an account of it in Ulugh Beg's Prolegomena (Part IV. Cap. I. 146 and S\u00e9dillot's Trs. 201). The nam\u00fbd\u00e2r is also called animoder in European books on astrology. It was resorted to when the exact date of birth was not known; that is when there was doubt as to the correctness of clocks, etc. Apparently\nSuddenly rays of divine light shone from the lattices, so that all who were privileged to be present, both small and great, perceived them. Those who were entitled to speak, asked his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b the meaning of the phenomenon, and he replied, \"A rose of the rose-garden of the Khil\u0101fat will just now come into bloom, and a child of light will emerge from the hidden chamber of magnificence and glory, and from the gorgeous sar\u0101t\u012b of Honour and Fortune and plant his foot in the circle of existence. The refulgence of his greatness will melt the hearts of the enemies of the State in the crucible of destruction, and confer new splendour and glory on our race and family. Nay, rather, the night-chamber of the universe will acquire grandeur and beauty from his world-lighting rays.\"\n\nM\u012br \u2018Abdu-l-hai \u0160adr, one of the purely-born, related as follows:\u2014\"One morning, his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b was bowed down in reverie, and seemed much distraught. After a time, he raised his head and exclaimed, \"Praise be to God the Gracious, the lamp of our royal family has been relit.\" On my asking the meaning of his giving thanks, his Highness replied, \"While I was in a state of\n\nit is here referred to as something used to calculate the time when a birth will take place. Ulugh Beg gives three nam\u016bd\u0101rs, viz., Ptolemy's, Hermes' and Zoroaster's. Vullers (s.v. 1352a) gives a quotation from the Bah\u0101r\u012b-'ajam, mentioning five nam\u016bd\u0101rs. The phrase harf-i-nam\u016b-d\u0101r probably means the formula of the nam\u016bd\u0101r. It would seem that the nam\u016bd\u0101r was also used to discover the nature of the coming child, e.g., its sex.\n\n1 Kaukaba means a star and is also the name of one of the royal ensigns, viz., a polished steel ball suspended to a pole. (Blochmann, Plate IX).\n\n2 B\u0101d\u0101oni has an account of him (III. 273). He calls him Mashhadi, i.e., from the town of Mashhad (Meshed) in Eastern Persia. He was a skilled penman and his brother, M\u012br \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h was a performer on the q\u0101n\u016bn (dulcimer). He is, apparently, the calligraphist mentioned in the \u0100in (Blochmann, 101 and 103), but though Mr. Blochmann identifies him with M\u012br \u2018Abdu-l-hai M\u012br \u2018Adl, this seems doubtful. (Blochmann, 468, 471 and 480). The man who told the story of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's dream was that monarch's \u0160adr,\u2014Lord High Almoner. This office was higher than the M\u012br \u2018Adl's (Blochmann 268) and it is not likely that a man whom B\u0101d\u0101oni praises for sanctity would take part in a drinking bout. (Blochmann 463). However, this is not impossible, for B\u0101d\u0101oni tells us (Lowe, 319) that the New Year festivities were too much for the sobriety of the Q\u0101z\u012bs and Muftis (Judges) and even of pious men.\n\n3 Lit. it appeared as if his blessed eyes had become red (or inflamed).\n\"sleep, a brilliant star emerged from a certain quarter (here his Highness pointed to the region where the glorious parturient was) and rose higher and higher every moment. And as it ascended, its size and brilliance increased, until its light had embraced the greater portion of the world. I asked a holy man what the luminous body was, and he replied that it was the light incarnate of my successor, and that whatever part of the earth had been shone upon by this world-illuminating ray, would come under his dominion, and be civilized by the light of his justice.\" Two days after this vision, the news came of the ascension of the auspicious star above the horizon of hope, and when the period of the spiritual manifestation and holy vision was compared, it appeared that the auspicious birth and the delivery of the miraculous message had occurred at one and the same time.\" When such an illustrious progeny is the lot of an eminent man, why should such a communication not be vouchsafed? And when such a boon followed, why should there not have been such a reverie, and such an interpretation? Such things may appear extraordinary to superficial observers and to materialists, but the pure-minded and far-seeing conjectured before the event, and knew with certainty afterwards that this was the shining of the world-lighting star and that the message betokened the darkness-destroying sun. And to those who have had the bliss of being long in the service of this Lord of the World and of understanding his glorious qualities, the appearance of such portents is no stumbling-block.\n\nNor is it hidden from the acute and scrutinising that though Maul\u0101n\u0101 Sharafu-d-din \u2018Ali-i-Yazd\u012b has in the Zafarn\u0101ma taken a superficial view of things and stayed Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur\u2019s true vision and T\u016bmana Khan\u2019s interpretation at His Majesty the Lord of Conjunction (Timur) and has explained the eighth shining star that issued\n\n---\n\n1 Meaning that his body was asleep but his soul awake.\n2 With that of the birth.\n3 Buzurg.

I. 11 and 12, but the full account of the dream is given in the Muqaddama or Preface to the Zafarn\u0101ma which has not been published in the Bib. Ind. edition. It is to be regretted that this Preface which Sharafu-d-din refers to at page 11, has not been printed. See Rieu\u2019s Catalogue I. 174, Add. 6538.\n5 See later on, in the detailed account of Akbar\u2019s ancestors.\nfrom Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur's breast\u00b9 and lighted up the world, of the appearance of his Majesty the Lord of Conjunction who is the seventh\u00b2 ancestor of his Majesty (Akbar), yet it is clear to the minds of those far-sighted light-dwellers who understand hermeneutics and the secrets of the dream-world that to explain seven stars as seven persons whose heads were not exalted by the diadems\u00b3 of rule, nor were seen on the dominion-adorning Divan of excellence, is remote from the principles of interpretation and the significance of dreams. Rather those seven stars are seven world-adorning potentates, and the world-irradiating light is the holy personality of his Majesty the King of Kings who hath by the light of his Being illumined the terrene and terrestrials. It is the auspicious Akbar\u2074 who was the resplendent light which arose from the breast of that Jupiter of good fortune (Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur). Although the latter be, numerically his Majesty's fifteenth\u2075 ancestor, yet among those there are seven stars of the zodiacal Sign of greatness and having the light of this world-illuminating King of Kings emblazoned on the foreheads of their biographies. These seven out of the fifteen\u2076 have been distinguished for greatness and world-adornment, and the eighth of the noble band is his Majesty the King of Kings. The light of their rectitude has made the horizons brilliant, and in the noble series of the fifteen\u2076 great ones, there has been given the glorious vesture of spiritual and temporal sovereignty to this perfect witness of Divine Power, and he has been made light-bestower of the inner and outer worlds. This explanation is not hidden from the subtle investigators of real significations. On this account a synopsis of the perfections of this series will be found in this noble volume, and\n\n\u00b9 The word in the text is j\u012bb or jaib. Later on (p. 68) the word used is gar\u012bb\u0101n.\n\n\u00b2 The text has eighth, but according to our idiom at least, the word should be seventh. Nor is A. F. consistent, for at p. 81 he calls Timur's son the sixth ancestor of Akbar.\n\n\u00b3 The author means that none of Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b's immediate descendants was a king. The first monarch of his race was Timur, and the seven stars are interpreted by A. F. to mean Timur and the six descendants who intervene between him and Akbar.\n\n\u2074 Sa'd-i-Akbar.

Whoever at the present day shall peruse with the eyes of discernment and knowledge, the account of these illustrious magnates and understand the office of the Caliph\\(^1\\) of the Age, and become acquainted with the stages of the degrees of greatness of the Lord of the World, will applaud the exposition.

He is a very famous saint of the 11th and 12th centuries. His full name is Ab\u016b Na\u1e63r Ahmad ibn Abu-l-basan. He bore the titles Zhanda-pil, Raging, or perhaps Mighty, Elephant, and Shai\u1e25u-l-isl\u0101m. He is called N\u0101maq\u012b from his having been born in or at least, from his family's having sprung from the village of N\u0101maq in the district of J\u0101m. He was born 441 H. (1049), and died in 538 H. (1141). (Dr. Rieu states that according to the Jaw\u0101hiru-l-asr\u0101r\nHoly be his tomb, (i.e., R. I.

But the fullest account of Ahmad is in J\u0101m\u012b's Nafah\u0101tu-l-uns, J\u0101m\u012b being a townsman of the saint. The life will be found in Lees' ed. of the Nafah\u0101t. (Cal. 1859, 405\u2013417) Ahmad-i-j\u0101m is said to have converted 300,000 persons, and to have had 42 children, of whom 17 survived him. His Diw\u0101n is in the B. M., and he wrote other works. There is an explanation of the term Zhanda-pil by M. Pictet, in the Journal Asiatique for 1843, (Series IV., Vol. II., 141). He derives it from the Sanscrit can\u1e0da. According to Fraser (Journey into Khorasan, Lond. 1825, App. B., 39), it means Elephant-reviver or animator, and was given to the saint because he, at the cost of his own life, restored to life the Governor's elephant. Fraser describes his tomb as a rough slab of marble, situated in a grove of pistadin trees, at Turbat-i-j\u0101m, half way between Mashhad and Her\u0101t.\n\nAccording to A. F. Ahmad-i-j\u0101m was the ancestor of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's mother as well as of his wife (Hamida B\u0101n\u016b). Hum\u0101y\u016bn visited the South in 1544 and put up an inscription which still exists. (J. R. A. S. Jan. 1897).\n\nApparently the father of Hamida B\u0101n\u016b was named 'Al\u012b Akbar, for Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn says, Khw\u0101jal Mu'azzam (whom he calls Akbar's maternal uncle) was the son of 'Al\u012b Akbar. According to A. F. the Khw\u0101ja was only uterine or half-brother of Hamida B\u0101n\u016b, but it seems probable that 'Al\u012b Akbar was also her father, for Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn goes on to say that 'Al\u012b Akbar was descended from Hazrat Shaikhul-Isl\u0101m, Zhanda-pil Ahmad-i-j\u0101m. Gulbadan calls Hamida B\u0101n\u016b, the daughter of M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 D\u014dst. Apparently M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 is the Maul\u0101n\u0101 B\u0101b\u0101 D\u014dst Sadr mentioned (Akbarn\u0101ma I. 315) as a servant for whom Hind\u0101l had a special regard. Perhaps M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 D\u014dst is not his full name\u2014though it occurs in the Akbarn\u0101ma\u2014and he may also have been named 'Al\u012b Akbar. Gulbadan says that M\u012br Abu-l-Baq\u0101 took part in the marriage and that two lakhs of rupees were paid (or promised) as dower by Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Abu-l-Baq\u0101 is referred to in the Akbarn\u0101ma (I. 172). In the same volume, (I. 174, l.15) mention is made of Khw\u0101ja Hajr\u012b J\u0101m\u012b (qu. the Superintendent of Ahmad J\u0101m\u012b's cell?) as having been forward in promoting the marriage. Gulbadan's account of the marriage negotiations is minute and interesting.\noccurred when the altitude of Procyon was 38\u00b0 and when 8hs. 20m. had passed from the beginning of the night of 8th \u0100b\u0101n 464, Jal\u0101l\u012b era, corresponding to 19th Isfand\u0101rmiz 911, of the old era, and to night of Sunday (shab-i-yak-shambha) 5th Rajab, lunar era, and to 6th K\u0101rtik 1599, Hind\u016b era, and to 16th\n\n1 See Note 1, page 50.\n\n2 \u0634\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0634\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064e\u0651\u0645\u0652\u0634\u064e\u0629\u0650, shi'ra-i-sh\u0101miya, the Syrian Dog-star, i.e., Procyon or the Lesser Dog-star; Sirius or the Greater Dog-star being called Shi'ra-l-yam\u0101ni or Dog-star of Yam\u0101n, i.e., S.W. Arabia. Procyon is called also Shi'ra-l-'ab\u016br, the Little Dog-star.\n\n3 \u0100b\u0101n is the eighth month in the Persian year. The Jal\u0101l\u012b era is also called the Malik\u012b because established by Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn M\u0101lik Sh\u0101h Selj\u016bk\u012b. 'Umar Khayy\u0101m was one of the astronomers employed in settling this calendar. (Jarrett III. 29.) The era began on 5th Sha'b\u0101n, 468 (15th March, 1076,) according to one account and according to another, on 10th Rama\u1e0d\u0101n 471 (15th March, 1079). Ulugh Beg says, \"This is a difference of 1097 days, the cause of which is unknown to us, but as the second is that generally adopted, we shall follow it.\" (S\u00e9dillot, Prolegomena, 27.) The cause of the difference is explained by S\u00e9dillot at page 235. The initial date, 15th March, 1079, is that adopted by Gibbon and appears to be that followed by A. F. for 1079+468=1543 or nearly October 1542.\n\n4 This is the era of Yazdajird, so-called because it dates from the first year of his reign, viz., A.D. 632. The era, however, began long before his time, and according to A. F. dates from the accession of Jam\u0101hid. It began afresh with the accession of each king, and it has received the name of the Yazdajird era because he was the last king of Persia, he being great-grandson of the famous N\u016bgh\u012brw\u0101n, and being vanquished by the Mu\u1e25ammadans. (Jarrett III. 28.) A. F. makes the difference between the two eras 447 years. The Yazdajird era began on 16th June, 632 A.D. Isfand\u0101rmiz is the 12th month in the Persian year.\n\n5 A. F. here calls the Hijra era Hal\u0101l\u012b, lunar, but in the \u0100in, he calls it Hijra. The date corresponds to Sunday, 15th October, 1542 O.S. and 25th October N.S. Gulbadan gives the date as 4th Rajab, but this must be a mistake, for 4th Rajab, 949 was a Saturday, and the birth took place on a Sunday. S\u00e9dillot (Prolegomena 240) says that 5th Rajab is the day of Mu\u1e25ammad's conception, but Ulugh Beg makes it 15th Rajab and calls it the feast of victory. It is possible that Akbar got his name of Mu\u1e25ammad from his having been born on this festival.\n\n6 This era is the Samvat or Vikramaditya era. It began B.C. 57 so that its 1599=1542 A.D. The Bibl. Ind. ed. has 1519, but this is clearly wrong and for n\u016bzdahum\u2014we should read nuwad \u016b nuhum\u2014as in the Lucknow ed. and No. 564 and all the other copies which I have consulted. According to Cowasji Patell's tables the Samvat year 1599 began on 10th October. The year began apparently with 1st K\u0101rtik so that 6th K\u0101rtik=15th October.\nTishrinu-l-awwal 1854, Greek era;\u20144hs. 22m. of the said night (that of Saturday, or rather Sunday) were remaining. The place was the auspicious city and fortunate fort, Amarkot, which belongs\n\n1 Tishrin, the Tishri of the Jewish Calendar, was the first month of the Syrian year. It corresponds to our October. The era is that of the Seleucid\u00e6 and is also called Syro-Macedonian. It began 1st October B.C. 312, so that 16th Tishrinu-l-awwal = 16th October, 1542. It appears from Cowasji Patell's Chronology (162) that the Syro-Macedonian year of 1854 began on 2nd October so that 16th Teshrinu-l-awwal corresponds exactly with 15th October. A. F. calls the era Rumi (Greek). In the Ain (I. 279) he calls it the era of Alexander of Greece, but at p. 274 l.c. he calls it Rumi. He says it took its origin from the death of Alexander II. Bicornutus, but that it did not come into effect till 12 years after his death. Ulugh Beg treats it as a Christian era and gives, under it, the dates of the Christian festivals. (See S\u00e9diolot, Text 54 and Trans. 62). Mas'udi, writing in the 10th century, does the same thing. (See French trans. III. 405)). Al-biruni (Chronology of Ancient Nations, 282) also gives the Christian festivals and says that the Melkites, Nestorians and Jacobites observed them. In Golius' notes to Al-farghani (19) it is stated that the Jacobites and Nestorians use this era, but that the Malekites begin their year in January.\n\n2 A. F. gives two statements of the number of hours\u2014one taken from the beginning of the night and the other from its end. Probably he used two records. The sum of the two sets of figures, 8hs. 20m. and 4hs. 22m. is 12hs. 42m. which agrees with what apparently, would be the length of the night at Amarkot on 25th October, 1542 (25th is the true date allowing for the difference between Old and New Styles). According to a communication with which I have been favoured by the Meteorological Department, Calcutta\u2014sunset on 25th October in lat. 25 N. is at 5:23 and sunrise, on that day at 6:5. I presume there would be little difference between sunset on the 25th, and sunset on the 24th. The length of the night, then, on 24th October, would be from 5:23 p.m. to 6:5 a.m. or 13hs.\u20148m.= 12hs. 42m. exactly! On 15th October, sunset occurred at 5:59 p.m. and sunrise at 5:32 a.m. The 8th Aban of the Persian era apparently corresponds to 26th October. It will be remembered that this era anticipated the corrections of the Gregorian Calendar. Apparently there is some mistake about the years 464 H. and 911 H. for when reduced to Christian years, they give 1543 and not 1542.\n\n3 Properly Saturday, the birth occurring early on Sunday morning. Muhammadans count their day or nythemeron from sunset.\n\n4 Amarkot is a town in Scinde lat. 25\u00b0 21' N. and long. 69\u00b0 46' E. (Greenwich). Gulbadan spells it Amarkot and in the Imperial Gazetteer of India, it appears as Umarkot. The u is short. Its latitude and\nto the second climate and lies in latitude 25\u00b0 N. and longitude 105\u00b0 E. of the Fortunate Isles. At that time, the imperial army had marched to subdue the country of Tatta (Scinde) and the litter of fortune had been directed to halt in the pleasant country and fortunate fortress, on account of the time's drawing nigh for the appearance of the light of the world.\n\nAmong the strange circumstances which occurred near the time of the appearance of the light of fortune, there was this,\u2014that before the auspicious moment above-mentioned, the mother felt a pressing urgency to bring forth the child. Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd, the astrologer, who by the king's order, had been stationed by the chaste threshold in order that he might cast the horoscope, was perturbed, as the moment was inauspicious. \"In a short time, a glorious moment will arrive, such as does not happen once in a thousand years. What an advantage if the birth could be delayed.\" Those who were present made light of it and said, \"What is the good of your agitation? Such things are not under control.\"\n\nAt this very instant the impulse to bring forth passed off and the astrologer's mind was set at rest somewhat by the transit of the unlucky moment. The ostensible cause of this supreme blessing was that a country midwife had been just brought in to perform her office, and as her appearance was repulsive, the holy soul of Miryam Mak\u0101n\u012b felt disgusted and her even temper was rebuffed and so the urgency for parturition left her. But when the chosen time came, the Maul\u0101n\u0101\n\nlongitude are also given in the \u0100in. (Jarrett IV. 59 and text II. 32). The latitude there given is 24\u00b0 and longitude 100\u00b0. In Gladwin's trans. the longitude is omitted, and the latitude given as 20\u00b0 40'. The statement in the Akbarn\u0101ma is more to be relied upon, as giving A. F.'s figures correctly, because the degrees are expressed in words. The Fortunate Isles are called by Ulugh Beg and A. F. the Eternal Isles, \u062c\u0632\u0627\u06cc\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u062a, Juz\u0101'ir-i-kh\u0101lid\u0101t.

The confidants of the harem said to him, \"Her Majesty,\\(^1\\) has after much suffering, got an interval of relief and is now slumbering. It would not be right to waken her. Whatever Almighty God, in His good pleasure, has determined, must happen.\" Just as they were speaking, the pains of travail came upon her Majesty, Miryam Mak\u0101ni, and awoke her and in that auspicious moment, the unique pearl of the viceregency of God (Khil\u0101fat) came forth in his glory.\n\nThey spread the carpet of joy under the canopy of chastity and curtain of honour, and made ready a feast of joy and exultation. The veiled ones of the pavilion, and the chaste inmates of the royal harem anointed the eye of hope with the collyrium of rejoicing and coloured the eyebrows of desire with the indigo\\(^2\\) of merriness. They decked the ear of good tidings with the earring of success, painted the face of longing with the vermilion of pleasure, encircled the fore-arm of wish with the bracelet of purpose, and donning the anklet of splendour on the dancing foot, stepped into the theatre of delight and joy and raised the strain of praise and gratulation. Fan-wavers sprinkled otto of roses, and winnowed the air with sandal-scented arms. Dark-haired maidens freshened the floor by rubbing it with perfumes. Rose-cheeked damsels gave a new lustre to joy by sprinkling rose-water. Red-garmented, sweetly-smiling nymphs enveloped the silver-bosomed ones in gold, by scattering saffron. Rose-scented, jasmine-cheeked ones soothed the rapid dancers with camphorated\\(^3\\) sandal-wood.

But the description of heavenly exultation and of the joys of pure spirits is beyond the range of speech.\n\nAs soon as the light of glory deigned to emerge from the orient of fortune, they despatched swift couriers\\(^1\\) and hard-riding horsemen to convey the life-increasing news and the heart-expanding tidings to the tents of fortune and encampment of glory. This had been sixteen\\(^2\\) miles off, but on the morrow of the night which had been pregnant with the day of auspiciousness, the army marched at dawn from that station, and encamped about midday at a spot\\(^3\\) which was very charming and salubrious, with clear water and delightful trees. There his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat \u0100shiy\u0101n\u012b had halted and a number of courtiers were assembled and in attendance.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Though A.

(44) says that after leaving Amark\u014dt, Hum\u0101y\u016bn marched 24 miles the first day to the banks of a large pond, and that the next day while the king was encamped there, a messenger arrived with the news. But according to A. F. Hum\u0101y\u016bn did not arrive at the pond in one day. His camp was 16 miles off from Amark\u014dt and on the morning of the birth, he marched again at dawn and arrived at the halting place where the water was, at about midday. Apparently he did not get the news till the third day, for we are told that he heard of it two days after his vision which was simultaneous with the birth. Jauhar cannot be relied on. He began his Memoirs 45 years after Akbar's birth (995\u20131587) and he incorrectly states that the birth was on 14th Sha'b\u0101n. In Ilh\u0101had Fa\u1e0d\u1e63 Sirhind\u012b's rescension (No. 1890), this is altered to 14th Rajab. The late Kab\u012b R\u0101j \u010cy\u0101mal D\u0101s wrote a paper in the Asiatic Society's Journal (J. A. S. B. LV., Part 1. 1886, 80) to show that the date given by Jauhar was the correct one. I do not agree with his conclusions, but his paper is\u2014like all the Kab\u012b's productions\u2014carefully written and interesting. He translates Jauhar from MSS. and his rendering is closer than Stewart's. He mentions that\nVerse.\n\nVerdant trees with heaven-brushing tops,\\(^1\\)  \nCasting shade o'er the head shadowed by the bird of paradise.\\(^2\\)  \nThe melodious singing of the birds of the meadow  \nPoured joyous notes over the banquet.\n\nSuddenly a blackness was caused by the hoofs of galloping horses. Mehtar Sumbul,\\(^3\\) an old slave (ghul\u0101m), of his Majesty\n\nthere is a stone two miles N.-W. of Amarkot which professes to mark the spot of Akbar's birth, but the date on it (963) is that of the accession.\n\nStewart's trans. makes Jauhar's account more discrepant from A. F.'s than it really is, and Erskine has not fully amended Stewart here. On referring to the original, I find that Jauhar says nothing about \"the first day\" or the \"next day.\" What he says is, that they marched thirty miles (12 k\u014ds) and then encamped on the bank of a pond (haus). No doubt, this place could be identified, It must lie between Amarkot and J\u016bn, S. W. of the former (W. S. W. is perhaps more correct). The B. M. MS. is worm-eaten at the important place, but the words seem to be d\u016b shab, two nights. It is not likely that Humayun would march 30 miles in one day and it is probable enough that he made his marches by night. Jauhar says that the news was brought by a q\u0101sid at early morning, viz., at prayer-time. He gives Saturday, 14th Sha'b\u0101n as the birthday and says that Badrud-din and Jal\u0101lu-d-din have the same meaning. But this is hardly correct and 14th Sha'b\u0101n 949, appears to have been a Thursday. Gulbadan says the birth took place three days after Humayun left Amarkot and adds that the moon was in Leo and that the birth occurred under a fixed sign.\n\n\\(^1\\) Lit. rubbing their umbrellas against the sky.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u062c\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0651 zill-i-hum\u0101t\u012b, the shadow of the Hum\u0101, a fabulous bird from which the name Humayun is derived. The Hum\u0101 was supposed to prognosticate a crown to every head that it overshadowed. (No. 564 B. M. MS. Add. Nos. 5610 and 6544 have zill-i-khud\u0101t\u012b, the shadow of God, which the Bib. Ind. gives as a variant). The meaning is said to be that the trees were so high that they even overshadowed the Hum\u0101 or phoenix, high-soaring bird though it be.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sumbul means hyacinth. The name looks like that of an eunuch. Sumbul is mentioned in the Akbarn\u0101ma (I. 224) under the title of Mir \u0100t\u012bsh (Master of Ordnance) and also (263) as commanding a party of musketeers. Mir \u0100t\u012bsh means Artillery Officer or Head of the Ordnance Department, like the Corps of Fire-workers of the H.E.I.C.'s army, but it may also mean, head of the musketeers or marksman. (The \u0100t\u012bsh Sark\u0101r or Fiery Department was one of the divisions of offices\nJah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and who was, subsequently raised by the kindnesses of his Majesty, the King of Kings, to the title of \u0160afdar Kh\u0101n (rank-breaking chief), having perceived that blackness, in which the white sheen of two worlds was enveloped, reported the matter to his Majesty who said, \"Should these horsemen bring tidings of the birth of the 'light of the eyes of sovereignty, we will make you ruler over a thousand.\"\n\nVerse.\n\nKings of the earth might well give the seven climes as a reward for such good news.\n\nOn that side too, the swift horsemen gave rein to their horses and galloped forward, and the riders\u00b9 of the steeds\u00b2 of auspicious-\n\nmade by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, in accordance with the number of the elements.) Mehtar Sumbul was perhaps called \u0160afdar Kh\u0101n because of the destructive effects of his muskets. (See also l.c. 266). He is mentioned by B\u0101yaz\u012bd (I.O.MS. No. 216, p. 186) as Sumbul Mir \u1e24a\u1e93ar and as \u0160afdar Kh\u0101n Mehtar \u0100tigh. This was in Hum\u0101y\u016bn's reign, which might be taken to indicate, contrary to the text, that he got the title from Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\nIn his first volume, A. F. does not give him the title of \u0160afdar Kh\u0101n but calls him Kh\u0101n and Mir \u0100tigh. He was one of those who accompanied Hum\u0101y\u016bn to Persia. He is mentioned, as \u0160afdar Kh\u0101n, in the 3th year of Akbar and as taking part in the siege of Rantambh\u016br (Akbarn\u0101ma II. 330). We are told (l.c. III. 772) of a \u0160afdar Kh\u0101n's being promoted to the command of 1,000 in the 45th year. He is also mentioned l.c. 184. Blochmann (532) notices a \u0160afdar Kh\u0101n Kh\u0113sa Khail as entered in the Tabaq\u0101t list, but as Commander of 2,000. He does not appear in the \u0100m list.\n\nThe title Mehtar is of common occurrence in Persian histories. In modern Persian, it is used to mean a groom, but in India it is the designation of a sweeper. In Meynard's Turkish Dict. it is explained as \"Officier remplissant les fonctions de chambellan ou hussier; le Grand Vizier avait dans sa suite quarante mehtar faisant fonction de Suisses de son palais.\" D'Herbelot (s. v. Sanbal) says, \"Ce mot est aussi un nom d'homme, et se donne plus ordinairement aux esclaves noirs, par ironie, comme ceux de Jasmin et de Cafur qui signifient le jasmin and le camphre dont la blancheur est parfaite.\"\n\n\u00b9 Gulbadan says, as also does Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, that the news was brought by Tard\u012b Beg and that Hum\u0101y\u016bn rewarded him by forgiving his past offences. See Jauhar for an account of his overbearing manners. He was afterwards put to death by Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n.\n\n\u00b2 \u0631\u062e\u0634, raksh, the famous horse of Rustam.\nPhilosophers worthy of Alexander's approval, and astrolabe-knowing observers who were always seated in the council of mysteries and were confidants of the secrets of the heavens, made the horoscope of the auspicious birth a mirror for their enlightened intellects, and reported that the aspects of the planets and their complete or partial applications prognosticated length of life and the high ascension of the Native on the steps of sovereignty and the degrees of the khilafat, as witness the scheme which has been taken from their tables and exhibited on a page of abridgment.\n\nLikewise his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b who held high rank in mathematical sciences and had a heaven-embracing mind, and whose acute intellect was the heart-expanding mirror of Alexander and the world-displaying cup of Jamsh\u012bd, made by his own lofty understanding, wondrous deductions and calculations from the indications of the horoscope of the divine masterpiece. He compared them with the results obtained by the other sages from the marks on the plains of the heavens, and the significations of the terrestrial and celestial bodies. He found that they all agreed and corroborated one another.\n\nWhen the sublime festivities were over, he (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) named that holy pearl\u2014in accordance with the secret message and divine intimation already described,\u2014by his lofty title and majestic appellation and caused it to be inscribed in the lists of auspiciousness and records of fortune. Thus the interpretation of the veracious vision was fulfilled after an interval of two years and four months!\n\n---\n\n1 \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0650\u062a\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u062a\u0652, illi\u1e63\u0101l\u0101t. This is a technical word and corresponds apparently to the astrological applica-\n\ntions. (Dic. of T.T. 1508, near foot.) Guido Bonatus has a paragraph entitled De alitiscal planatarum. (Basle 1550, p. 132). He says alitiscal sine continuatio. I omit the iz\u0101fat after taf\u0101\u1e63\u012bl. The technical words for conjunction are \u012bjtim\u0101' and qir\u0101n.\n\n2 Referring to Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd's horoscope, exhibited below.\n\n3 Blochmann (553n). Alexander's mirror is a fable arising out of the Pharos at Alexandria.\n\n4 From 4th Rabi'u-l-awwal, 947 to 5th Rajab, 940.\nGod be praised! Hail! celestial name and sublime talisman which came down from highest heaven and the realms of light and glory, whose splendour and whose rays have taken possession of the Orient and the Occident.\n\nAmong the excellencies of the name\u2014which is full of wonders\u2014there is one which my honoured elder brother, an encyclopaedia of inward and outward perfections, the poet-laureate, Ab\u016b-l-faiz Faizi has brought out in various admirable writings, namely, that by the mysterious connections of letters which are lofty vocables and which,\u2014whether separately or in combination,\u2014display their influences, it appears that the indicatory letters (baiyin\u0101t-i-hur\u016bf) of the word aft\u0101b (Sun) make the number 223 and thus correspond to the numerical value of the letters of the word Akbar.\n\n1 Faizi, the elder brother of A. F. was Maliku-sh-shu'ara or Poet Laureate; lit. Prince of Poets. Blochmann 491 and 548, and Akbarn\u0101ma III. 535.\n\n2 Kalim\u0101t-i-\u0101liy\u0101t. A cabalistic expression. See Dic. of T. T. 320, l.8.\n\n3 Dar '\u0101lam-i-tajarrud \u016b tarakku, lit. world of solitude and combination. I think it means separate letters and letters in combination, and not the spiritual and temporal worlds.\n\n4 baiyin\u0101t-i-hur\u016bf, indications or evidences of the letters, A. F. here enters on cabalistic lore. The Dic. of T. T. (Calcutta 1853. 128 et seq.) gives twelve basat or modes of manipulating letters. (See also l. c. 156, l.3). Faizi's seems to be the second mode, called the basat-i-talaffuz and the basat-i-b\u0101'\u012bn\u012b and the basat-i-z\u0101hir\u012b (l. c. 128, l.7). It proceeds by pronouncing the letters and dividing them into z\u0101bar and baniy\u0101t. Thus aft\u0101b (the Sun) is composed of alif, f\u0101', t\u0101', alif and b\u0101'. The first letter of each of these words is called z\u0101bar and is discarded; thus, (a)lif, (f)t\u0101', (t)a, (a)lif, (b)a. The remaining letters are the baiyin\u0101t or baniy\u0101t and their value is calculated according to abjad as follows\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nl &= 30 + f = 80 = 110 \\\\\na &= 1 \\\\\na &= 1 \\\\\nl &= 30 + f = 80 = 110 \\\\\na &= 1 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTotal ... 223\n\nThe Editor of the Luck Akbarn\u0101ma says there are nine letters in aft\u0101b, i.e., alif, f\u0101', t\u0101', b\u0101' = 9. He cuts off the t as being over 100 in value (its numerical value is 400) and the remaining eight give 223; viz., alif = 111; f\u0101' = 90; t\u0101' = 10; and b\u0101' = 12; total 223. Thus he arrives at the same result, by a different road. Blochmann (237, Book II. \u0100in No. 3) gives apparently another illustration of this process.\n\nThe word Jal\u0101lah is, I think made to yield 66 by cutting off the\nVERSE.\n\nThat very light which is yielded by the world-adorning Sun,\nIs produced from the brows of the sublime Shahanshah,\nThat Akbar is allied to Aftab (the Sun),\nIs proved by the evidence (baiyinat) of the names.\n\nAnother of the delightful things about this glorious name is\nthat those who are acquainted with the secrets of cabalistic lore and\nwho know the influences and combinations of letters, who are cogni-\nsant of the hidden stations of the divine essence and of revelations,\n\nfirst letter of Ja and then count-\ning the others; viz., a = 1; l = 30;\na = 1; l = 30; and h = 5. I do\nnot see how the word Allah could\nmake 66 by abjad for a double letter,\ni.e., one with taqdid, is, according\nto rule, counted as one only. Per-\nhaps, however, Allah is regarded as\ncontaining three lam\u0101s.\n\nThe Lucknow editor says also that\nthe words aftab and n\u016bl, i.e., Nawal\n(Kishor), (his printer and publisher)\nharmonize if similarly treated; both\nyielding 612! See his note p. 19\nfolio ed. and pp. 9 and 10 (preface)\ned. 1284 H. (1868 A.D.)\n\nThis quatrain occurs on p. 3436\nof Faizi's Diwan (B.M.MS. Add.,\nNo. 7794) and is preceded by the\nfollowing note by Faizi.\n\n\"Among the strange mysteries\nwhich have been revealed to me,\nwho have placed on the head of my\nheart the four-gored cap of four-\nfold sincerity, there is this that the\nbaiyinat-i-asm\u0101-i-hur\u016bf (evidenti-\nary letters) of the sun (aftab) agree\nin number with the numerical value\nof the word Akbar, which is 223.\"\n\nProbably Faizi plays on the double\nmeaning of the word asm\u0101 which\nstands both for 'names' and 'attri-\n\nbutes.' He has many other quatrains\non the same subject.\n\nJafar means cabalistic\nlore or the art of the mysteries of\nletters. It is said to take its name\nfrom Jafar \u1e62adiq the 6th Im\u0101m, but\nno doubt, the art is much older and\nwas in great vogue among the Jews.\nThere is a learned article on the\nKabbala by Dr. Ginsburg in the Ency.\nBrittanica. The literal meaning of\ntak\u1e63\u012br is breaking in pieces, it com-\ning from the root ka\u1e63r. It is applied\nto the cabalistic science apparently\nbecause that partly consists in break-\ning up words into their component\nletters, which again are allocated to\nthe four elements. The word seems\nto be often used as synonymous with\nJafar. See Dic. of T. T. 1251, s.v.\ntak\u1e63\u012br and Ibn Khald\u016bn, Notices et\nExtraits, XXI, 189.\n\nhuv\u012byat, ipseity. See\nWhinfield's Gulshan-i-r\u0101z, 31 and\nDic. of T. T. 1539.\n\ntanasrul\u0101t, lit. alightings\nor descendings.\nand are aware of the illumination\\(^1\\) and obscuration of alphabetical letters, according as they are with or without diacritical points, have assigned seven out of the twenty-eight letters of abjad\\(^2\\) to each element. Now the equably-proportioned letters of this august name are a collection of the four-fold degrees (i.e., the four elements), and tell of the collection of the four stages of Beauty, Majesty, Bounty and Perfection. Thus alif is Fire, k\u0101f Water, b\u0101 Air and r\u0101 Earth. Whenever a name, by reason of the equality of its composition, is so made up of letters that no element is wanting in it and no element is redundant, that name is perfectly equipoised between its limits. This equipoise results in the name-bearer\u2019s being possessed of excellent qualities, bodily health, length of life, exaltation of sovereignty and lasting joy.\n\nAnother point in this matter becomes conspicuous in the window of intelligence, viz., that although this Greater Fortune (Sa\u2019d-i-akbar,\u2014meaning Jupiter, and here taken for Akbar) may have enemies on various sides, yet they will be scattered and annihilated. For in the composition and arrangement of the letters of the name, there are two medial letters\u2014viz., k\u0101f and b\u0101 (k and b); k\u0101f is watery\\(^3\\).\n\nI conjecture from the arrangement of the words in the text and from the fact that Faiz\u012b called his undotted composition shu\u2019\u0101\u2019u-l-ilh\u0101m, rays of inspiration, that the lucid letters are those without diacritical points. Perhaps the name was given to them because they do not require to be lighted up or explained by dots. Dotted letters are styled also mu\u2019jama and undotted muhmala.\n\n\\(^2\\) Abjad, the employment of the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet as numerals.\n\n\\(^3\\) The letters of the alphabet are divided into four classes, corresponding to the four elements and k\u0101f (k\u0101f) belongs to the class representing water. See Dic. of T. T. 128. The Lucknow editor points out that k\u0101f has also the meaning of clearing.\nand carries away the supernal enemies, who are fire, and b\u0101 which is aerial, scatters the nether enemies, who are earthly. It is right that those who know the subtleties of secrets, should become cognisant of the mysterious minutiae of the import of the wondrous Name, and partake of the bounty of its auspiciousness and beneficence.\n\n1 The \"supernal enemies\" are apparently, the jinns or demons who, according to Muhammadan cosmogony, were made out of fire. They are represented by a (alif) which is a fiery letter. R (ra) is an earthy letter according to some classifications (Dic. of T.T., watery) and so, represents earthly enemies. In the I.O.MS. No. 3330, (which is a copy of Akbarn\u0101ma, Vol. I., given by Colonel Kirkpatrick), the explanation of the numerical value of the letters of \u0101ft\u0101b, which I have already given, is stated in a marginal note. The annotator also arranges the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet in four classes, as follows:\n\n- Fiery:\u2014a, z (z\u0101l), sh, t, f, m, h ... 7\n- Aerial:\u2014b, t, s, g, n, w, y ... 7\n- Earthy:\u2014h, kh, r, d, 'ain, ghain, l ... 7\n- Watery:\u2014g, j, z, q, z, q, k ... 7\n\nTotal ... 28\n\nThe Dic. of T. T. gives a somewhat different classification.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE AUSPICIOUS HOROSCOPE WHICH WAS CAST AT THE TIME OF THE GLORIOUS BIRTH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTITUDES OF THE GREEK ASTROLABE.\n\nVERSE.\n\nApproach heaven-weighing observer,\nRegard with understanding the connexion of the spheres,\nLook at the beautiful horoscope of the Lord of conjunction,\u00b9\nBehold the auspicious charter of two worlds,\nContemplate this glorious rescript,\nFortune upon fortune, light upon light.\n\nWhen the victory-grasping standards were leaving the fort of Amark\u00f4t, Maul\u00e2n\u00e2 C\u00e2nd, the astrologer, who was possessed of great acuteness and thorough dexterity in the science of the astrolabe, in the scrutinizing of astronomical tables, the construction of almanacs, and the interpretations of the stars,\u2014was deputed to be in attendance at the portals of the cupola of chastity (Miryam Mak\u00e2ni, Akbar's mother), in order that he might observe the happy time and ascertain exactly the period of birth. He\u00b2 reported in writing to the exalted camp that, according to altitudes taken by the Greek\n\n\u00b9 S\u00e2hi-b-qir\u00e2n. This title which properly belongs to T\u00eem\u00fbr and was afterwards bestowed on Sh\u00e2h Jah\u00e2n, seems to be applied here to Akbar because, according to the Indian horoscope (vis., No. 2.), Jupiter and Venus were in conjunction at his birth. (See text 28, l.6.) The title may however, mean only Lord of epochs.\n\n\u00b2 Maul\u00e2n\u00e2 C\u00e2nd also cast the horoscope of Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer (Sal\u00eem) in the 14th year of Akbar, 977 = 1570. Text II. 346.) He is mentioned in Jai Singh's preface to the Muhammad S\u00e2hi Tables, under the name of Mull\u00e2 C\u00e2nd, and as the author of the Ta\u0161tilat-i-Akbar S\u00e2hi. (Dr. Hunter, Asiatic Researches, V. 177.)\nastrolabe, and by calculations based on the Gurg\u0101n\u012b tables (Canon of Ulugh Beg\\(^1\\)) the figure of the nativity was as follows:\n\n**FIGURE I.**\n\n**AKBAR'S HOROSCOPE.**\n\n| E. | II.

For information about his Tables see the works of Hyde, Greaves and S\u00e9dillot. He was born in 1393 and put to death by his own son in 1449. His Tables were first published in 1437. See Jarrett II. 5n., and an interesting paragraph and note in Erskine's B\u0101bar (51.)\n\n\\(^2\\) I have added the numbers of the Houses to the diagram, and have inserted the date of birth. It will be seen that there is a difference of form between the horoscope as here given and the more elaborate dia-\nAlthough Virgo is a Bicorporal Sign, partly Fixed and partly Tropical, yet in this frontispiece of felicity, the fixity of the horoscope is, on close observation and careful consideration, indicated by grams to be found in European books. In the latter, the observer is supposed to be looking south and the First House or Ascendant is on his left hand. In the horoscopes of the text, the observer appears to be looking east, for the First House or Ascendant is in front of him.\n\nAlthough I have used capital letters for the designation of the Signs, it should be remembered that the Houses are those of the figure and not of the heavens, i.e., they are mundane and not celestial. They do not correspond exactly with the celestial Houses, for the First House, i.e., the Ascendant or horoscope, and which is that of life, begins at 7\u00b0 of Virgo.\n\n1 This is the Greek \u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. The signs of the Zodiac were divided into three groups, viz., Tropical, Fixed and Bicorporal. Each group contained four Signs and the list is as follows:\n\n| Tropical | Fixed | Bicorporal |\n|----------|-------|------------|\n| Aries    | Taurus| Gemini     |\n| Cancer   | Leo   | Virgo      |\n| Libra    | Scorpio| Sagittarius |\n| Capricornus | Aquarius | Pisces |\n\nAstrologers also divided the Signs into three groups of four each, thus:\n\n| Tropical | Fixed | Bicorporal |\n|----------|-------|------------|\n| Aries    | Taurus| Gemini     |\n| Cancer   | Leo   | Scorpio    |\n| Libra    | Virgo | Sagittarius|\n| Capricornus | Aquarius | Pisces |\n\nA. F. seems to say that the term bicorporal, like common, meant that a Sign possessed the properties of the Signs on either side of it; e.g., Virgo was bicorporal because between the Fixed Leo and the Tropical Libra.\n\nThe Signs were also divided into Tropical, Fixed, Equinoctial and Bicorporal: and into Moveable, Fixed and Common. According to Lilly's \"Christian Astrology,\" the Bicorporal Signs were those represented by two bodies, such as Gemini and Pisces. Sagittarius is bicorporal because a centaur. But Virgo is also bicorporal, as may be seen from the table in Albiruni's India (Sachau, II. 218). Apparently this is because the figure was regarded as that of a hermaphrodite. Lilly (86. 2nd ed. 1659) says \"Signs are constituted between moveable and fixed and retain a property or nature partaking both with the preceding and consequential Sign.\" So also Ptolemy says, \"The Bicorporal Signs severally follow the Fixed Signs; and being thus intermediately placed between the Fixed and Tropical Signs, they participate in the constitutional properties of both from their first to their last degree.\" (Tetrabiblos, Ashmand, 35.) This explains A. F.'s description of Virgo, for she is between the Fixed Leo and the Tropical Libra. Lilly (96) describes Virgo as a \"barren Sign, but also human,\" and as \"an earthly, cold, melancholy, barren, feminine, nocturnal, southern (northern?) Sign, the house and exaltation of \u03a8 (Mercury), of the earthly triplicity.\"\ntwo circumstances. One is that the cusp\\(^1\\) of the Ascendant is \\(7^\\circ\\),\\(^2\\) and so belongs to the first third\\(^3\\) (decanate) of the Sign which, astrologers are agreed, denotes fixity. The other is that Virgo is an earthy\\(^4\\) Sign, and fixity\\(^5\\) is the property of the earthy element. These are two proofs of the fixity of the throne of sovereignty and of the stability of the cushion (\\(masnad\\)) of the Khil\u0101fat. Moreover, Mercury, the Lord of the Ascendant, is in this glorious nativity posited by the Greater Fortune,\\(^6\\) for Jupiter, i.e., the Greater Fortune, is beside him, and Mercury is a planet who makes good luck, better luck. Venus, the Lesser Fortune, is in Mercury\u2019s\\(^7\\) House (Virgo) and Mercury, in hers, vis., Libra.\\(^8\\) He signifies wisdom,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0642usp, \\(juz\u016b-i-t\u0101li'\\), i.e., part or degree of the Ascendant or horoscope. I think it here means cusp, i.e., the place where the House begins. The phrase occurs again in the text, 30. l.2.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bad\u0101oni (Lowe, 269), mentions that on the festival of the 8th of Virgo, Akbar used to show himself marked on the forehead like a Hindu, and had strings of jewels tied on his wrists by Brahmins. Apparently this was because it was the anniversary of his birth. The 8th degree of Virgo might correspond to 8th \u0100b\u0101n.\n\n\\(^3\\) Each Sign contains \\(30^\\circ\\) and is divided into three parts of \\(10^\\circ\\) each. It may be noted that \\(7^\\circ\\) \\(7'\\) Virgo is said to be Mercury\u2019s term. A.F. here calls these parts thirds, but they are commonly called decanates or faces.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Signs are also divided into four groups or triplicities, corresponding to the four elements. Taurus, Virgo and Capricornus constitute the earthy triplicity.\n\n\\(^5\\) Referring to the Ptolemaic notion of the earth\u2019s being fixed and in the centre of the universe.\n\n\\(^6\\) Jupiter is called Sa'd-i-Akbar or the Greater Fortune (\\(Fortuna Major\\)) and Venus Sa'd-i-A\u1e63ghar or the Lesser Fortune (\\(Fortuna Minor\\)). Saturn and Mars are called the Infortunes.\n\n\\(^7\\) Mercury is regarded as a planet of mixed disposition and the character of his influence depends on his associate. Here, because he is near Jupiter, he is benefic. Virgo is his House and place of exaltation. According to the Lucknow editor, his culmination or highest point of exaltation is \\(7^\\circ\\) \\(4'\\) Virgo, but according to the Jyoti\u1e63a-Prak\u0101\u015ba it is \\(15^\\circ\\). Haly in his De judiciis astrorum says (16), Mercurius fortunatus est cum fortunatis, et infortunatus, cum infortunatis.\n\n\\(^8\\) Libra is the diurnal House of Venus, while it is the hub\u016b\u1e6d or fall of the Sun. Hence the distich in the Anw\u0101r-i-Suhail\u012b (Cap : IX. Story 3. 417. Hertford ed.) \u201cLibra is the mansion of the star of amusement and joy, but the fall of the king of the planets.\u201d (ac. the Sun.) There is another astrological allusion in the same story, (416) where it is said that certain sailors made,\nknowledge, dexterity and ingenuity, and both by equal distribution of (mundane) Houses and by Sign, he is in the Second House which is connected with the means of livelihood and the support of life. He bestows on the Native amplitude of perfect reason and understanding, so that he adorns the universe with the light of intellect in the affairs of this life and the next, and opens knots, whether spiritual or temporal, with the very finger-tips of his understanding.\n\nlike the Moon, their mansion in a watery tower (burj). I believe this refers to the fact that the Moon's mansion is Cancer which is a watery Sign, i.e., belongs to the watery triplicity of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces.\n\n1 \u062a\u0633\u0648\u06cc\u062a taswiyat. In the dictionaries, this word is defined as meaning making equal or parallel. Here it refers to the division of the horoscope into twelve parts or Houses. \"There are two kinds of Houses in astrology,\" says Wilson in his Dictionary of Astrology, \"mundane and planetary. Mundane Houses are each a twelfth part of a figure (a horoscope) and begin their number at the east angle which is the First House (Ascendant), and proceed according to the order of the Signs. The Second House is the left, under the Earth, and is what they call Succeedent, because it succeeds to the angle. The Third is to the left of the Second and is called Cadent, because it falls from the angle of the Fourth. The Fourth is the north angle or Imum Coeli.\"\n\nThe full expression appears to be \u062a\u0633\u0648\u06cc\u062a-\u0627\u0644\u0628\u06cc\u0648\u062a taswiyatu-l-buy\u016bt\u2014and not merely taswiyat as in the text. Chapter XII of Ulugh Beg's Prologomena (Part III.

Cf. also B\u0101dsh\u0101hn\u0101ma of \u2018Abdu-l-h\u0101mid (99 1.4 fr. foot), where reference is made to the two \u1e25is\u0101bs or modes of calculation. But taswiyat alone also occurs there. (I. 103, 1.9.) Of course the Houses of a horoscope seldom or never exactly correspond with the Signs, for they are counted from the degree and minute which is ascending at the time of birth. The author means here that Mercury is in the Second House of the figure and also, in the Second Sign counting from Virgo, viz., Libra,\u2014for, as the mundane and celestial do not correspond, Mercury might have been in the Second House of the figure and yet in the Third Sign, counting from the Ascendant.\n\n2 The Second House is that of fortune, wealth, or property, the First being that of life.\n\n3 The technical name for the subject of a horoscope.\nAs Venus who is renowned for auspiciousness and prosperity and who signifies joy and pleasure,\u2014is in this horoscope, (i.e., the Ascendant or First House) she keeps ever ready the things of joy and gladness and the materials of magnificence and glory. It is a remarkable circumstance that whilst the lord of the Ascendant (Mercury) is in the House of wealth (the Second), the lord of the House of wealth (Venus)\\(^1\\) is in the Ascendant (the First or House of Life.) Thus the two together signify personal and circumstantial felicity, and bestow a life of power and pleasure. Jupiter\u2014the Greater Fortune\u2014who signifies justice, integrity, magnanimity, firmness of soul and civilization,\\(^2\\) is also in the Second House and, as he is in sextile\\(^3\\) to the Fourth House which is that of finality, he keeps perfection of power and pleasure closely associated with the glorious condition of his Majesty, down to the very end. The double-natured (\\textit{dipsychus}) Mercury has acquired extreme auspiciousness, by reason of his vicinity to the Greater Fortune, and has heaped felicity upon felicity. He signifies that the Native will, by greatness of genius and loftiness of development, become the apex of mankind, and he indicates assemblages of the masters of understanding and reason and of the lords of perception and penetration. The philosophers of the age and sages of every sect will attend the wisdom-protecting Court, and ingenious wits of all countries will forsake their native lands, and donning the pilgrim\u2019s garb, will circumambulate his sublime threshold. Whatever the ray of illumination shall have darted into his inspired soul, will be consonant with reason and reality. Having opened the gates of justice and equity to all mankind, he will in every action hold fast by the principles of rectitude and protection (\\textit{diy\u0101nat u siy\u0101nat}). He will apply his genius to founding magnificent buildings such as have rarely been constructed in the times of former princes, and in those choice mansions he will pass his time in varieties of joys and happinesses and in all manner of ease and independence.\n\nAmong remarkable\\(^4\\) circumstances we have this,\u2014that Venus\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Though Venus be feminine, she is spoken of as \\textit{\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib}, i.e., lord or master.\n\n\\(^2\\) Lit. building up of the world.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sixty degrees or two Houses, i.e., one-sixth of the heavens, apart.\n\n\\(^4\\) The author seems to have forgotten that he had already mentioned this circumstance. See supra.\nis in the House of Mercury and Mercury in the House of Venus. Thus three happy influences are combined;\u2014viz., 1\u00b0. the happy influence of Jupiter,\u20142\u00b0. the happy influence of Venus;\u20143\u00b0. the happy influence which Mercury has imbibed from the fortunate twain. This is something very uncommon.\n\nThe Great Light (the Sun), the benefactor of the universe and moderator\\(^1\\) of the affairs of mortals, and the special bestower of glory, power, pomp and prestige is in the Third House and in a Fixed Sign (Scorpio), signifying the grant of dignity, glory, greatness and magnificence. As he has come out of his fall\\(^2\\) and his face is set toward his exaltation, he has made the Native\u2019s glory increase, day by day, and as he is in aspect\\(^3\\) to the Ninth House (Taurus) which is that of travel, the standards\\(^4\\) of victory and conquest will always be upraised on the march,\\(^5\\) while he himself protects mankind from\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Referring to the Sun\u2019s control of times, and seasons.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u0647\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651 hub\u016bt, fall, i.e., the House opposite to, or six Houses apart from, the House of exaltation. Libra is the House of the Sun\u2019s fall, as being opposite to the House of exaltation, viz., Aries. The author says that, as the Sun has emerged from Libra and entered Scorpio, he has left his fall and is proceeding towards his exaltation in Aries.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u0646\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0631 n\u0101q\u012br. The aspect is one of opposition or 180\u00b0 which is regarded by astrologers as malefic. I do not therefore see the appropriateness of A.F.\u2019s remark unless indeed, he is using the word n\u0101q\u012br in a non-technical sense and merely as meaning one who beholds or inspects. There is a reference to the aspects in Paradise Lost X. 656.\n\nTo the blanc Moon\nHer office they prescribed, to the other five\nTheir planetary motions and aspects\n\n---\n\nIn Sextile, Square, and Trine and Opposite Of noxious efficacy.\n\n\\(^4\\) I do not feel sure of the meaning here. It is perhaps, the standards who are represented as illuminating the world,\u2014the allusion being to the royal flag or standard\u2019s bearing a picture of the sun. See Blochmann Sayyid Ahmad\u2019s Plates, IX. Figure I. The kaukabah (fig. 2) has a sphere suspended from it which apparently represents the Sun. See Blochmann\u2019s quotation from Terry IX.\n\n\\(^5\\) \u0633\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0631 safar. This word, like the German Reise, means both travel and war and A.F. probably intended to take advantage of the equivocation. There seems also an antithesis intended between the words safar and kanaf, \u0642\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641 region or country. The standards of victory are abroad on the march while the Sun (Akbar) remains in the region of light-giving and protecting. The literal translation is \u201che (i.e., the Sun or Akbar)\u201d\nthe confusions and calamities of the age and is the light-giver of the world.\n\nAs the Third House which is that of kindred, is Scorpio, it is significant of Scorpion-kinsmen.\\(^1\\) (\u0623\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0628 aq\u0101rib-i-'aq\u0101rib.) Saturn there sends those alien relatives (distant-near ones) by calamities and disasters, to the nethermost hell of destruction and perdition.\n\nThe Fourth angle\\(^2\\) is Sagittarius and is the House of the final issue of things. Jupiter, its lord, is in sextile to it and is contiguous\\(^3\\) to the ameliorated Mercury,\\(^4\\) and in his own term\\(^5\\) and triplicity.\\(^6\\) Whatever the Native deigns to undertake, will be accom-\n\n(is in) the region of protecting and guarding and is giving light to the world.\\(^7\\) There is a similar passage in the B\u0101deh\u0101hn\u0101ma (102 top line et seq.) but there is an interesting difference in the mode of treatment. The Ninth House is also that of religion. A.F. passes over this point but the caster of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's horoscope lays stress on it and infers from the fact of Venus (whom he calls the planet of Isl\u0101m) being in aspect towards the Ninth House that Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n will be an upholder of religion and a faithful follower of Muhammad. In Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's horoscope, the position noticed in Akbar's is reversed, the Third House being Taurus, i.e., that of Venus, and the Ninth being Scorpio.\n\n\\(^1\\) There is a similar play on the two words in Bad\u0101oni. (Lowe 71.) The expression is used there with reference to Akbar's maternal uncle, Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam who certainly was a scorpion-relative.\n\n\\(^2\\) There are four angles or cardinal points, viz., the First, Fourth, Seventh and Tenth Houses of a horoscope. The Arabic name is \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0627 wata'd lit.: tent-pole. They are the most important houses in a figure, the First being the Ascendant, the Fourth its nadir, i.e., the north angle or hypogenum; the Seventh, the west or descendant angle, being opposite to the First, and the Tenth being the Mid-heaven. Sagittarius is Jupiter's House and gaudium.\n\n\\(^3\\) Mutta\u1e63il. This is perhaps a technical term and refers to a planet's applying to another planet.\n\n\\(^4\\) 'U\u1e6d\u0101rid-i-mas'\u016bd. Mercury is called mas'\u016bd, benefited or auspicious, because he has become benefic by proximity to Jupiter and Venus. See Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b (Sachau II. 212.)\n\n\\(^5\\) \u1e0da\u1e0d\u1e0d. The degrees of each sign are divided among the five planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury, and those assigned to each are called its term (terminus). The term is one of a planet's essential dignities and tables of terms, showing the degrees assigned to each planet, are to be found in all astrological books.\n\n\\(^6\\) This is the fiery triplicity, consisting of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius. Jupiter is lord of this triplicity during the night and so, was its lord at the time of Akbar's birth.\nplished with the greatest ease, and the terminations of his works will be prosperous.\n\nThe Fifth House is that of offspring and is Capricornus, a sign indicative of many children. Mars, the soldier's planet, is there and is a kadkhud\u0101 of the Ascendant which is the centre of the laws of life. It is a glorious thing that this warlike planet is in his House of exaltation, and by face,\n\n1 According to Haly (p. 2) Capricorn is a sign of few sons. It is Mars' House of exaltation. Haly's words are: Signa multorum filiorum Pisces, Cancer, Scorpio; paucorum filiorum, Aries, Taurus, Sagittarius, Capricornus et Libra.\n\nThe word kadkhud\u0101 perhaps has the sense of the Alcochoden of medieval times. It seems to mean the planet in a horoscope which has most dignities in a hylegical place. Alcochoden is sometimes defined as the Arabic word for hyleg. (See note infra on hyleg.) According to Vullers' Dictionary, s.v., kadkhud\u0101 means, in astrology, the soul or vital principle in opposition to kadban\u016b, the body. See Maf\u0101tihi-l-'ul\u016bm, 331. It would seem that kadkhud\u0101 corresponds to the term \"lord of the geniture,\" and means a planet in possession of all its dignities, essential and accidental. Such a planet is said to be mutbazz (from ibtir\u0101s). Velschius in his Commentarius in Romana Naurus (1676) identifies kadkhud\u0101 with hyleg. The Burh\u0101n-i-g\u0101ti states that kadban\u016b is equivalent to the Greek hail\u0101j (hyleg). Kadkhud\u0101 means paterfamilias and kadban\u016b, materfamilias and so, Vullers suggests that hail\u0101j may be the Greek \u1f00\u03bb\u03bf\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2, but I believe the derivation from \u1f00\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 is correct.\n\nApparently what is meant here, by the Ascendant's being a centre of the laws of life, is that the Ascendant or First House is the House of Life.\n\nI take this expression to mean merely that the First House is that of life, but there may be an allusion to the Fardars,\u2014the Alfridaria of Cardan, and the true translation may be, \"a lord of the geniture who is the centre of the code of life;\"\u2014alluding to the fact of Mars' governing the years from 28 to 35.\n\n4 \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 wajh. This is the Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd. It is the third part of a sign (10\u00b0) and thus corresponds to the decanate. The word face is also commonly used in English books on astrology. Dozy (II. 7852) says, s.v. wajh, \"Les astrologues partagent chaque signe du zodiaque en trois faces, de dix degr\u00e9s chacune. Les trente-six faces sont assign\u00e9es, chacune \u00e0 une des plan\u00e8tes ou au soleil ou \u00e0 la lune.\" Salmon, however, in his Horae Mathematicae divides each Sign of the Zodiac into six faces of 5\u00b0 each. See Tetrabiblos, Ashmand 28n. The above is what is meant by the term face as applied to a Sign, but the word has another meaning as applied to a planet. Ashmand\ntriplicity,\u00b9 *darij\u0101n,*\u00b2 *\u0101darj\u0101n*\u00b3 and dodecatemorion\u2074 has endowed the Native with long life, and has given him the enjoyment of many sons and grandsons. His sons, too, will be fortunate and capable. He will also have world-traversing, victorious soldiers. It is a beautiful coincidence that in the horoscope of the Lord of Conjunction, (Timur) Mars is in the Fifth House, as mentioned in the Zafarn\u0101ma.\u2075 Experienced philosophers have laid stress on the\n\n(l. c. 54) says, \u201cEach planet is said to be in its proper face, when the aspect it holds to the Sun or Moon is similar to that which its own House bears to their Houses, for example, Venus is in her proper face when making a sextile aspect to either luminary, provided she be occidental to the Sun, but oriental to the Moon, agreeably to the primary arrangement of her Houses. And it follows that Saturn is in his proper face when he is five Signs, or in quintile, after the Sun or before the Moon; that Jupiter is so in trine; Mars when in quartile; Venus when in sextile; and Mercury when only one Sign (or, in modern phrase, semi-sextile) after the Sun or before the Moon.\u201d Similarly Wilson (Dic. of Astr.) says, \u201ca planet is in its *face* when it is at the same distance from the Sun or Moon as its House is from their Houses and in the same succession of Signs.\u201d Probably when A. F. speaks of the *wayh* of a planet, he means this kind of face and not the third part of a Sign, which he designates by *darij\u0101n* decanate.\n\n\u00b9 The earthy triplicity, consisting of Taurus, Virgo and Capricornus.\n\u00b2 On the meaning of this word, see Note I. at the end of this Chapter, page 82.\n\u00b3 On the meaning of this word, see Note II. at the end of this Chapter, page 82.\n\u2074 *agnd\u0101'ashartah*, a twelfth part or two and a half degrees of a Sign; the *\u03b4\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd* of the Greeks. Scaliger refers to it in his notes on Manilius (Leyden ed. 179), and a table of Twelfths is given in Bengali books on astrology. The planet which rules the Sign is lord of the First Twelfth; the rulers of the two following Signs are lords of the second, and third, and so on. Thus Mars is lord of the first dodecatemorion of Aries, he being regent of Aries; Venus lord of the second, as being ruler of Taurus; and Mercury is ruler of the third, as regent of Virgo. The expression *twelfth part* is explained in Dict. of T. Ts. (I. 185). Ashmand (50) says the Twelfth of a Sign is technically called a place. The Persians call it *ducazda bahra*.\n\u2075 Bib. Ind. ed. I.14. The Fifth House is that of children. The Fifth House of Timur\u2019s horoscope was Taurus, and Jupiter was there as well as Mars, while Venus was in the Third House (Pisces.) Timur, like Augustus was born under Capricorn. His nativity, as cast by Ashmole, will be found in Hyde\u2019s *Syntagma* (II. 466) as pointed out by Gibbon.\npower of Mars in the horoscopes of princes. The present powerful and holy horoscope excels that of the Lord of Conjunction in that this majestic planet is in his House of exaltation (Capricornus) and has the other dignities mentioned above. This signifies glory and greatness, lofty rank, victory and dominion, and that yet his glory will be greater and better from his youth upwards. The Moon who is the intermediary between the celestial influences and the terrestrial elements, having come as an increaser of light, points the way to daily increasing dominion.\n\nShe is also the hyleg, which is the tabernacle of the soul and\n\n1 The heaven of the Moon is that nearest the earth, and therefore she is regarded as a link between the heavens and the earth. She is also the distributor of light from the heavenly bodies to the earthy ones. See Akbarn\u0101ma II. 8.1.14. Haly calls the Moon, the Alguasil, i.e., the Vizier or Prime Minister of the Sun.\n\n2 This is an epithet of the Moon. She is also called the swift-goer, sari'u-s-sair, in opposition, perhaps, to Saturn who is called the slow-goer. (Akbarn\u0101ma II. 10.18.)\n\nHyleg is a word well-known in European astrology and comes from the Greek \u1f00\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2. It signifies the foundation or beginning of life and also the duration of life. S\u00e9dillot says (Prolegomena, Text 149). \"Ce mot signifie le lieu de la vie; il est pris dans le sens de dur\u00e9e de la vie.\" Hyleg is also defined as the Moderator, Significator or Prorogator of life.\n\nMoxon says (Mathematical Dictionary). \"Hyleg or hylech, an Arabic word signifying the Giver of life; a planet or part of heaven which, in a man's nativity becomes, in an astrological sense, the moderator or significator of his life; hence hylegiacal places are such as when a planet happens to be posited therein, he may be said to be hyleg or to have the government of life attributed to him; which places are commonly reckoned five, viz., the Ascendant, the Midheaven, the Seventh House, the Ninth and the Eleventh House. Also the Sun, Moon and Part of Fortune.\n\nThe question of hylegiacal places is one much discussed in astrological books. In the text the word is perhaps used as an equivalent for kad-b\u0101n\u016b, the body as opposed to the soul, kadkhud\u0101. Sachau (Chronology of Ancient Nations) has translated it by materfamilias. There is a curious note in Schefer's Chrestomatie Persane (I. 102) where he says that hyleg is the Arabic form of the Persian hail\u0101j which signifies master of the house or head of the family. And he mentions a book by Abu Mashar of Balkh bearing the title Kit\u0101bu-l-Hail\u0101j. M. Schefer supposes that this book must have treated of domestic economy, but it is almost certain it was an astrological work. Haly says (147) that Ptolemy established five hylegs, viz., the Sun, the Moon, the Ascendant, the Part of\nguardian of the body, and is in the Fifth House. As she is separating (mun\u1e63ar\u012bf) from Mars and is in trine to Venus, she is a cause of continual health, soundness of constitution and bodily strength.\n\nThe Sixth House is Aquarius and signifies armies. Saturn is the dominant and he is in the Third House which is that of allies and helpers. The Dragon's Head (R\u0101s\u00b9 or Anabibazon) is there and signifies soldiers of loyal and devoted clans.\n\nThe Seventh angle (i.e., the Descendant or west angle) is Pisces at the seventh degree, which is the term\u00b2 of Venus and belongs to her triplicity\u00b3 and \u0101darj\u0101n.\u2074 She gives\u2075 chaste veiled ones who are constant in pleasing service and respects; and she makes the Native happy and prosperous by their good offices.\n\nThe Eighth House is Aries; Mars is its lord and his benefic influences have already been described. He is in trine to the Ascendant and signifies the Divine protection\u2076 in positions of fear and hidden dangers.\n\nThe Ninth House (Taurus) is that of travel. As its regent (Venus) is posited in the Ascendant\u2014Virgo, she holds in readiness, tranquillity and pleasure in distant journeys and makes them a cause of increase of territory.\n\nFortune and the Place of Conjunction or Opposition of the Sun and Moon prior to the birth. The Moon was probably the hyleg in Akbar's horoscope because his birth took place at night.\n\nThe hyleg was also called aph\u0113ta and was opposed to anair\u0113ta, destroyer.\n\n\u00b9 Anabibazon, the ascending node of the Greeks and R\u0101hu of the Hindus.\n\u00b2 Cardan (De judiciis geniturarum. Nuremburg 1547. 79b.) gives the first seven degrees of Pisces as the term of Venus.\n\u00b3 Venus is the nocturnal lord of the watery triplicity or trigon, vis., Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces, for the last is her House of exaltation.\n\u2074 If \u0101darj\u0101n be the same as decanate, I do not see how the seventh degree falls within the \u0101darj\u0101n of Venus, for the rule is that the first decanate of a Sign belongs to the lord of that Sign and the lord of Pisces is not Venus but Jupiter. Pisces is, however, the House of Venus' exaltation, and its 27th degree is said to be the \u1f38\u03c8\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1, auj, of Venus. Perhaps the reference is to this. Possibly A. F. used the word \u0101darj\u0101n without understanding it.\n\u2075 The Seventh House is that of marriage.\n\u2076 The Eighth House is one of misfortune and danger. Hence the need for the Divine protection. To be in trine is to be 120\u00b0, four Houses, apart.\nThe Part of Fortune (Pars Fortunae) is in the Tenth angle which is that of dominion and prosperity (iqb\u0101l). Its lord, the auspicious Mercury, is in trine to it. As the Greater Fortune (Jupiter) is also in trine to it, this signifies majestic sovereignty, perfect reason and justice, and brings the world\u2019s treasures into the powerful grasp of the Native.\n\nThe Eleventh House (Cancer) is that of Hope. Its lord is the crescent Moon. She is in the Fifth House of the horoscope, and as she is in trine to the Ascendant, she is a cause of safety and of the attainment of desires.\n\nThe Twelfth House (Leo) is that of enemies. The Dragon\u2019s Tail (Zanab) being posited in it, makes the enemies of eternal fortune downcast and contemptible. It turns every wretch who averts his face from the altar of obedience, topsyturvy into the wilderness of annihilation. Its lord, the Sun, being posited in the Third House, viz., that of allies and helpers, will bring many opponents to repentance and the path of submission and devotion. A wonderful thing in this horoscope is that the Tenth House, that of dominion and sovereignty, is in Gemini of which the lord of the Ascendant, (Mercury) is the regent. It is established that every lord of the Ascendant desires to promote his own signification (or perhaps, what is committed to him), but that he may be frustrated by obstacles to his power. Now in this auspicious horoscope, Mercury\u2019s House is also that of dominion and sovereignty. Seeing that dominion (daulat) is posited in his own (Mercury\u2019s) House, why should he (Mercury) hold back from carrying out his own signification (or, from what has been committed to him)?\n\n---\n\n1 \u201cAn imaginary point in the heavens supposed to contain equal power with the luminaries.\u201d (Wilson, 306). In the Tetrabiblos (Ashmand) we read that the Part of Fortune is calculated by counting the number of degrees between the Sun and Moon.\n\n2 Katabibazon, the descending node of the Greeks; Ketu of the Hindus. It is where the Moon crosses the ecliptic on her way south.\nNOTE I. (from page 78.)\n\n\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646 dar\u012bj\u0101n. Vullers describes this as an astrological rule according to which a Sign is divided into three parts and a planet assigned to each. The original Persian form is \u062f\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0646 dar\u012bg\u0101n. It is the dreshk\u0101na or drekk\u0101na of the Hindus. Albir\u016bn\u012b (II. 222) says, \u201cFurther, there are the triangles, called drekk\u0101na. There is no use in enlarging on them, as they are simply identical with the so-called drayj\u0101nat of our system.\u201d Unfortunately Albir\u016bn\u012b did not foresee a time when Arabian and Persian astrology would be forgotten and his Canon Masudicus a sealed book. Sachau speaks of it (there are four copies in Europe and one in the Mull\u0101 Fr\u012bz Library at Bombay) as awaiting the combination of two editors a scholar and an astronomer, but probably, a third, an astrologer, would also be required. Colebrooke says (Asiatic Researches IX. 367) that the dreshk\u0101na answer to the dec\u0101ni of European astrologers. The dec\u0101ni also correspond to the wajh of Arabian astrologers and according to the Lucknow editor of the Akbarn\u0101ma, are called by Hindus \u0161\u016brat, face. Decanus, according to Scaliger\u2019s notes on Manilius, (329) comes from the Latin and not from the Greek. The Luck. ed. gives an explanation of the word dar\u012bj\u0101n (27) and the corresponding term drekk\u0101na is explained in Bengali books on astrology. It seems that every sign is divided into three parts each of 10\u00b0, that the planet who presides over the sign, is lord of the first 10\u00b0, that the next 10\u00b0 are ruled by the planet who presides over the Fifth Sign from that under division, and that the third 10\u00b0 or drekk\u0101na is ruled by the planet presiding over the Ninth Sign from that under division.\n\n(With reference to the \u201ctriangles\u201d in the above quotation from Sachau, it should be observed that the word in the original is \u062b\u0644\u062b\u0627\u062a ala\u1e63la\u1e63, the plural of g\u0101liq and should be translated thirds and not triangles. The drekk\u0101na are not triangles but ten degrees or thirds of a Sign.)\n\nNOTE II. (from page 78.)\n\n\u0622\u062f\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0101darj\u0101n. This word puzzled me for a long time. It is not to be found in the dictionaries except under the form \u0622\u062f\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0101drj\u0101n or \u0622\u062f\u0631\u062c \u0101drj. They however do not explain even this word; saying only that it means \u201ccertain figures and mysteries in astrology.\u201d (See Vullers 78 and Steingass.) The Lucknow editor (27) says that \u0101darj\u0101n is the same as wab\u0101l, and he repeats this explanation at page 30. He there says also that \u0101darj\u0101n, is a fortitude or dignity superior to that of the dar\u012bj\u0101n, but inferior to that of the wajh face. It is clear therefore that it cannot bear the same meaning as wab\u0101l which is a debility and corresponds to the English detriment. Perhaps the editor connected it with awj, apris or exaltation. Another explanation was sent me from India, to the effect that when two planets were in the same mugallagat\nor triplicity, each was said to be the \u0101darj\u0101n or partner of the other. If this were so, the word might be connected with the Arabic \u0627\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062c or \u0627\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062c idraj or idr\u0101j, a fold or folding; but I now believe this explanation is quite incorrect. The fact seems to be that \u0101darj\u0101n or \u0101daraj\u0101n is merely a form of the word dar\u012bj\u0101n and is probably nothing but that word with the Arabic article al prefixed. The word occurs in the Maj\u0101t\u012bku-l-wul\u016bm (ed. Vloten, Leyden 1895, 226) under the forms aldahaj and aldoraj and is there explained as synonymous with wa\u1e63k, \u0161\u016brat and d\u0101rij\u0101n. The editor says it is the same as the Greek \u03b4\u03ad\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2. That this explanation is correct appears from the Latin translation of an early treatise on Astrology by an Eastern writer, commonly known as Alchabitius, but whose real name was \u2018Abdu-l-az\u012bz ibn \u2018U\u1e63m\u0101n Alqab\u012bs\u012b and who, according to the Biographie Universelle lived in the 10th century. He wrote a Mad\u1e25kal or Introduction to Astrology which was translated into Latin by Johannis Hispalensis and was several times reprinted. Its Arabic title is given in \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Khalfa\u2019s Lexicon (V. 473) as Mad\u1e25kal f\u012b \u2018ilm-al-nuj\u016bm. In the Differentia Quarta (Cap. IV. The pages are not separately numbered, but this chapter is a few pages after dd4.) of this work, there is the following passage:\n\n\u201cModus inveniendi dominum decani.\u201d\n\n\u201cEt est hoc adorogen, hoc est ut dividat ascendens in tres partes; et sit omnis divisio 10 graduum; dabique divisionem primam domino ascendentis; et secundam domino quinti signi ab eo; et tertium domino noni; nam ascendens, 5, et 9 una semper sunt triplicitas. Verbi gratia, ab initio Arietis usque in decimum gradum ejus est dorogen i. (i.e.) decanus est Martis. Et si fuerit ex 10 gradu usque in gradum erit ejus dorogen sol, dominus Leonis. Et si fuerit 20 usque in finem ejus erit dorogen Jupiter, dominus Sagittarii.\u201d\n\nThe same volume contains a commentary on Alchabitius by John of Saxony and at M.M.3, we have these words, \u201cEt est hoc adoringen. Hic docet invenire decanum.\u201d This commentary, it seems, was written in 1331, though apparently not printed till 1485.\n\nThe book is in the British Museum, and there is another copy of Alchabitius and of John of Saxony\u2019s Commentary which was printed at Venice in 1521. In this, too, we have the expression, \u201cEt est hoc adorogen\u201d and \u201cet est hoc adorogen.\u201d This is the passage according to the Venetian editions of 1485 and 1521. In another edition, printed at Bologna in 1473 (B.M. press-mark 8610 d. 10.) we have the form abdorungen, but otherwise the wording is the same. It begins, \u201cEt est hoc abdorungen\u201d and lower down has the important expression \u201cejus abdorungen, id est, decanus, est Mars.\u201d The occurrence of the letter b certainly seems to favour the supposition that the first syllable is merely the Arabic article, the b being a misprint for l. As for the expression et est hoc, the explanation is that the Differentia Quarta is a glossary of astrological terms and that et est hoc seems a literal rendering of the Arabic \u0627\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062c wa-minhu. The difficulty arising from A.F.\u2019s using the word as if it were of different meaning from dar\u012bj\u0101n, his speaking, for instance, both of the dar\u012bj\u0101n and \u0101darj\u0101n in the same passage.\nThis is due, I think, to the fact that each House of a horoscope consists of about 30\u00b0 i.e., of three decanates or darj\u0101n. Hence, in mentioning the dignities or properties of a House, instead of saying darj\u0101n and darj\u0101n or using the word wajh (face) three times over, he varies the expression for the sake of euphony. What the exact etymology of the word \u0101darj\u0101n or darj\u0101n is, I am unable to say. The varieties of spelling lead one to suppose it a foreign word. It is clear from Alchabitius, that \u0101darj\u0101n or \u0101daraj\u0101n is the proper spelling, and that the form arad\u012bj\u0101n of the B\u0101dh\u0101hn\u0101ma and the Dictionaries is incorrect.\n\nMost probably the word comes from the Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, a triangle. I do not think it can come from \u03b4\u03ad\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, for I do not see how the letter \u03c4 came to be inserted. It appears, from Sachau's Albir\u016bn\u012b, that the word which in our dictionaries is spelled darj\u0101n is in Arabic draij\u0101n. I have suggested above that the first syllable or letter of \u0101darj\u0101n is the Arabic article, but there may be another explanation. As Persian does not admit of conjunct consonants at the beginning of words, it is possible that when the word was borrowed from the Arabic or the Greek, the dr or the tr of the Greek necessitated either a prosthetic or a medial vowel. Thus tr\u012bgonon or draij\u0101n became in Persian, either adraj\u0101n or darj\u0101n. In a similar manner we have both Iskandar and Sekandar as transliterations of Alexander and dirham for the Greek drachme, Firangi for Frank, etc. But if \u0101darj\u0101n comes from tr\u012bgonon and not from dec\u0101nus, it must still be acknowledged that it came to have the same meaning as decanate in English or drekk\u0101na in Sanscrit, and is stated by Alchabitius to be the equivalent of dec\u0101nus.\n\nIf anything were necessary to prove that the word \u0101darj\u0101n is identical in meaning with wajh, facies, I think it is furnished by the fact that Haly, (i.e., Abu-l-hasan 'Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b-'l Raj\u0101l al-Shaib\u0101n\u012b) in his elaborate work on astrology, says nothing about darj\u0101n or \u0101darj\u0101n, though he has a chapter De Faciebus or, (as the Arabic has it) Fi-l-wuj\u016bh.\n\nMoreover Guido Bonatus has this passage (ed. Basle 1550 825) De dorunges non dico hic (the passage occurs in a chapter on the triplicitics) aliquid quoniam videtur spectare ad considerationem facierum, de quibus latius ac sufficienter dictum est superius in Tractatu primo in cap. ed Faciebus.\n\nScaliger has yet another spelling of darj\u0101n; he calls it dorogen and says the Arabs apply the term to the dodecalemoria. (Notes on Manilius 179 1.38.) This seems to be a mistake.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nSCHEME OF THE SKY-ADORNING NATIVITY OF HIS MAJESTY, THE KING OF 27 KINGS; AND SUMMARY OF THE STELLAR INFLUENCES, ACCORDING TO THE METHODS OF THE ASTROLOGERS OF INDIA.\n\nBy the calculations of the Indian astrologers, his Majesty\u2019s auspicious horoscope falls under Leo which is a Fixed Sign and is significant of perfect supremacy, victory, energy and superiority. The Sun, which takes more note of kings than of all the other objects in the universe, is the dominant, and this is a clear indication that the Native will be victorious and paramount over famous sovereigns and mighty rulers.\n\nThe pillars of his sovereignty and government will gain stability and strength, day by day, and the regulations of his exaltation and glory will be carried out firmly and with permanence. The rays of his wrath will consume the fore-arms of stiff-necked, evil-disposed ones, and the beat of his war-drums will turn to water the courage of rank-breaking, tiger-hearted men.\n\nThe scheme of the holy nativity is hereby set down in accord-\n\n1 This appears to be a translation of the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1. It may be rendered judgments.\n2 Later on, we find the horoscopes of the three princes, Salim (Jahangir), Mur\u0101d and D\u0101ny\u0101l, cast both according to the Greek and the Indian rules. There is also a horoscope of the Accession.\n3 Akbar said that the Sun specially favoured kings and that this was why they worshipped it,\u2014thereby scandalizing the shallow-minded. (Jarrett III, 388. Blochmann 155. Text 154 l.16.)\n4 panja. There is a play on the double-meaning of this word, panja meaning both rays and paws and also footprints, vis., those of Leo. Punja also means, in Hindi, a cluster, e.g., of stars.\n5 Lit. have consumed, the past tense being used for the futuro in accordance with the Persian idiom.\n6 Perhaps this is an allusion to the story of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s having burnt off 998 of the 1,000 arms of B\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u015bura at the place called Kardaha.\nance with the writing of the foremost of Indian astrologers, the Jotik Rai who was one of the servants of the royal threshold.\n\n**FIGURE II.**\n\n| II.

See Blochmann 404n., where he compares the title of Jotik Rai\u2014Court Astrologer, to Birbal's title of Kab Rai\u2014Poet Laureate. The Sanscrit word is Jyauti\u1e63ika\u2014one who knows the Jyoti\u1e63a. The expression Jyoti\u1e63h Rai is used in Jai Singh's preface and is translated Astronomer Royal by Dr. Hunter.\n\n2 Or, alongside of, or, together with.\nof his Majesty, the King of Kings, such rays of glory and power stream from the forehead of his might as to indicate that the Indian astrologers are not far from truth when they assert that his noble horoscope belongs to Leo. In their books of stellar influences, it is laid down that the Native of this Ascendant is wealthy, victorious over enemies, forgiving towards offenders, ruling according to just and equal laws, and accomplishing his purposes by force of his own reason and by firmness in his own opinions. He will be fond of travel and will reap benefit from it. And he is lord of excellent and obedient children. The meeting of Jupiter and Venus in the Second House makes the Native a guide in various arts and sciences.\n\nAs the Greater Fortune (Jupiter) is in the House of Mercury, he (the Native) will be endowed with beauty of form, proportional admixture of the elements, gravity of speech, social graces, lofty understanding, and sublime apprehension in theology and divine worship, and will be adorned with well-doing, and with ability to accomplish everything in accordance with propriety.\n\nVenus in Virgo, takes charge of the adornment of virtuous veiled ones and provides for the increase of beauty and elegance. As the Sun is in the Third House, he (the Native) will accomplish whatever great undertaking he desires to compass, without reference to any other person. He will be powerful and his brethren will not attain to him. Indeed the star of the brothers\u2019 horoscope is occulted. Men will be united and agreed in love of him. As Mercury is in the Third House, he (the Native) will be talented, versed in business, and disliking idleness, a subduer of difficulties, and a slayer of enemies (mashqat-kash u dushman-kush). His acute thoughts will revel in theology and other philosophies and will attain\n\n---\n\n1 \u062c\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u062a jabr\u016bt, omnipotence, etc. It is a word used by Sufis.\n2 \u0633\u0641\u0631 safar. It is probably intended that this word should have its Sufistic meanings also, viz., self-examination and thinking of the other world.\n3 Far\u0101ham \u0101mada. This may mean conjunction or only that both planets are in the same Sign.\n4 There is here a sketch of Akbar\u2019s personal appearance but it is very vague. See later on in Amir Fathullah\u2019s horoscope.\n5 Apparently because the Sun is regent of the First House or Ascendant.\n6 The Third House is that of brethren. The meaning is that as the Sun is in the Third House, the star of brethren is occulted or combust.\nthe rank of ecstasy. And as (Mercury) is in Libra, he will be famed throughout the world, and his good deeds will be widely known. He will be world-conquering and world-ruling for lengthened periods of time, and excellent contrivances and ingenious plans are indicated. As Saturn is in the Third House, he (the Native) will enjoy repose and much tranquility, and will have attached servants innumerable, but he will act according to his own personal courage and his own ripe reason. As (Saturn) is in Libra, and in exaltation,\u00b9 he (the Native) will be master of the treasures of the world, and as Saturn is under the shade of the venerable, world-warming Sun, his boundless treasures will last for lengthened periods and will remain unaffected by prolonged usage of them.\n\nHe will make delightful journeys with success and accomplishment of his objects. And there will not be a greater than he upon earth. Mighty\u00b2 black beasts (elephants) will await at his gate. As he grows in years, his power will increase, and he will, without trouble or pains, acquire great armies and perfect dominion and glory. His power and his felicity will be lasting, for there is no slower\u00b3 planet than Saturn, and among his gifts are extent of fortune, permanence of sovereignty, and length of days. The Sun, Saturn and Mercury are in one Sign. He will, therefore, be friend-cherishing, foe-subduing, well-knowing the laws of amity and inimity. Mars being in Sagittarius, mankind will glorify him. For Mars is in the triplicity\u2074 of the ascendant; and in the house of his friend.\u2075\n\nThis powerful friend is the Greater Fortune and puts away the sorrows and the apprehensions of the nations. And he will be happy and joyful. And by power visible and invisible, essential and accidental, he becomes Great of the Great and King of Kings. The glory of his renown embraces the world and the fame of his majesty\n\n\u00b9 Libra is Saturn's House of exaltation.\n\u00b2 The nigri barri of Horace. (\u0100in III. 241 and Jarrett III. 395.) Akbar said that when he first came to India he looked upon his liking (tawajjub) for elephants as a prognostic of his universal ascendancy.\n\u00b3 Alluding to the extent of his orbit which was then the largest known. \u010cani or \u010canai\u00e7cara, the Sanscrit name for Saturn means the slow (goer).\n\u2074 I.e., apparently the fiery triplicity to which both Leo and Sagittarius belong.\n\u2075 According to Cardan, Jupiter is not friendly to Mars; but according to the Jy\u00f1\u0101na Prak\u0101ra, they are friends.\nextends from shore to shore. Many princes and rulers will be subject to him, and, being afraid of him, will be obedient and submissive. And as Mars is in the House of Jupiter and the Sun is in sextile to him, the princes throughout the world will place their heads on the line of his command and make the dust of his threshold the adoration-spot of their obedience. The Moon is in the Sixth House; he may have powerful enemies but they will not reach him, nor be able to withstand the scorching lightning of his wrath and might, and they will always endeavour to gain his friendship so that by borrowing\\(^1\\) the lights of his alliance, they may be in safety from evil.\n\nAs the Moon's detriment\\(^2\\) is in Capricorn, the weakness of his enemies is signified. And there comes a sweet reasonableness to the Native which enables him to decide disputes according to equity and the real merits of the cases.\n\nAnd having examined contradictory faiths, and different dispositions, he guides every sect in the way of good works. His desire is that men should leave the hollow of imitative routine, and emerge into the straight highway of inquiry. And as Jupiter is in aspect towards him,\\(^3\\) the royal power and might will be beyond calculation. He will become possessed of tractable children and, as Venus is in aspect, high-minded chaste ones of excellent actions will serve him for long periods of life and he\\(^4\\) will have obedient and amiable children.\n\n**Sundry Rules of Indian Astrology.**\n\nThere are certain principles, too, to be found in the books of Indian philosophers which prove the grandeur of this holy nativity. If a planet occupy the twelfth (dodecatemorion) of the Moon, the Native will have pleasure throughout a long life, and the dust of sickness will hardly touch the garment-hem of his health and, while in the fullness of his powers, and having become a manifestation\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Iqti\u0101s.* According to Sylvestre de Sacy, it originally meant to borrow fire from another's hearth.\n\n\\(^2\\) Being the opposite of her mansion which is Cancer.\n\n\\(^3\\) Apparently referring to the fact that Jupiter and Venus are in the House next to the Ascendant.\n\n\\(^4\\) Perhaps *\u1e63\u016br*, they will have.\nof planetary dignities\\(^1\\) and having attained the acme of felicity,\u2014he will obtain a great kingdom, and will have long life and abundant blessings, and will be joyful in sublime stations and lofty palaces. Now, as in this horoscope Mars occupies the dodecatemorion of the Moon, all these things are fully proved and established. He will be lord of victorious armies, and be line-breaking and foe-scattering on the battle-fields, and everyone on whom the glance of his wrath shall fall, will be melted by his terrible majesty. And if an auspicious planet be in the dodecatemorion of the Sun, the honoured Native will be a mild prince, eloquent and wise, firm and fortunate. And in emergencies when the brave in battle and men of men may hesitate, the owner of these happy omens will never swerve, but will keep a steady foot on the skirt of fortitude and great-heartedness, and the trace\\(^2\\) of doubt and the smallest vestige of change will not reach the court of his circumspection. Now in this holy horoscope, the meeting\\(^3\\) of the two Fortunes in the dodecatemorion shows abundant auspiciousness. If the Sun be lord of the Ascendant, and be in the Third House, the noble Native will be advanced to lofty sovereignty. Now this glory is visible in the fortunate frontispiece (the diagram of the horoscope). If Jupiter, Mercury and Venus be all three in aspect to the Moon, this signifies that the Native will open up countries and will rule over them. Now in this embellished tablet (the diagram) they (the three planets) are kindling the lamp of dominion.\n\nIf the cusp of the Ascendant or the Moon be in the \\textit{nubbahr}\\(^4\\) of a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u064a\u064f\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0650\u0651\u0646\u064f ibtiz\u0101s. A friend suggested to me that this was a mistake for ibtir\u0101s, superiority, and this view appeared to be confirmed by the fact that ibtir\u0101s is the reading of MS. 564. It turns out, however, that ibtiz\u0101s is correct, it being an astrological term signifying a planet possessed of all its dignities and appearing in the horoscope (or perhaps in the First House). (See Dict. of T. Ts. I. 224 s. v. and the Maf\u016b-thu-l-'ul\u016bm 229). The next clause of the text is also an astrological term, sharaf, a planet in exaltation. The whole phrase is shah\u0101dat-i-ibtiz\u0101s u sa'\u0101dat-i-sharaf.\n\n\\(^2\\) The text has sa'\u012bca, horoscope, but the list of errata shows that this is a misprint for r\u0101'ihat, lit. odour or smell.\n\n\\(^3\\) Apparently Jupiter and Venus are meant. They have already been spoken of as meeting in the Second House, viz., Virgo.\n\n\\(^4\\) Nubbahr, nine parts. It means the dividing a Sign into nine parts of \\(3^\\circ 20'\\) each, and assigning a planet\nSign and four planets or more are in aspect to the Moon, the Native\n\nto each part. *Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b* (Sachau. II. 222) gives a rule for calculating the *nubh\u0101vr\u0101t*.\n\n*Nubh\u0101vr* is the Sanscrit *nae\u0101msa*. The Lucknow editor gives (27) a table shewing the arrangement of the *nubh\u0101vr*. It seems to have been a refinement of Indian astrologers and is not, I believe, referred to by Ptolemy. Carden in the peroration of his work on Astrological Aphorisms, takes credit to himself for discarding *nubh\u0101vr*, etc. His words are \"Abjecimus partes, facies, novenario, dodecatemoria, horas planetarias, atque castera id genus nugamenta.\"\n\nThe Indian book to which A.F. refers, appears to be the *B\u1e5bhat J\u0101taka* of Var\u0101ha Mihira. In N. Chidambaran Iyer's translation thereof, I find the following passage. (Madras, 1885, 114.) \"The *Lagna* (Ascendant) or the Moon, being in *Varg\u014dttama* position of (sic) all the planets, excepting the Moon, by the several groups of four, five and six planets, aspecting the *Lagna* or the Moon, the number of *Yoga* (s) obtained is 22.\" See also the *B\u1e5bhajj\u0101lakam* (Rasik Mohan Chatterji's ed. Calcutta, 1300 B.S. 79a.) An explanation is there given of how the number 22 is arrived at and the *cl\u014dka* is explained as giving a total of 44 kingdoms or *r\u0101jay\u014dga*(s). There being seven planets,\u2014the Sun is one of them,\u2014and the Moon being excluded, we get the number, 6, mentioned above.\n\nMonier Williams' Sanscrit Dictionary defines *r\u0101jay\u014dga* as \"a constellation under which princes are born, or a configuration of planets, etc., at the birth of any person, indicating him to be destined to kingship.\"\n\nThe *Varg\u014dttama* above referred to is defined as follows: (Iyer 10). \"In the moveable and other Signs, the first, the central and the last\" (i.e., the First, Fifth and Ninth) \"*nae\u0101msa*(s) are known as *Varg\u014dttama* positions. Planets in such positions will produce good effects.\" The chapter in which this passage occurs, is that dealing with *r\u0101jay\u014dga* or the birth of kings. *Yoga*, however, also means conjunction.\n\nBlochmann (105) has the following passage\u2014\"At the command of his Majesty, Muhammad Kh\u0101n of Gujr\u0101t translated into Persian, the *T\u0101jik*, a well-known work on astrology.\" (The original is at page 116 of the Bib. Ind. ed. and the notes give the various reading *n\u0101jak*). Gladwin similarly read *t\u0101jik*, but in a copy of his translation in the British Museum, Sir W. Jones has written the marginal emendation *j\u0101tak*. Probably this is correct. There is, it is true, a book or a\u2014*Gastra* on Hindu astrology, called the *T\u0101jik-grantha*, but this was, as its name implies, a translation from the Persian. See Weber's *Indische Studien* II. 247. Dr. Weber is inclined to derive the word from *T\u0101jik*\u2014Arabian\u2014and to suppose that the original language was Arabic, but there seems no reason to go further back than to Persian. *T\u0101jik* is a well-known\nwill have 22 Kingdoms and many countries will be permanently in his possession. Now, in this horoscope, not only are the cusp of the Ascendant and the Moon in their nubhahr, but five planets are in aspect to the Moon, viz., the Sun, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and Mercury.\n\nname for a Persian, hence probably the title of the Indian book. It is not likely that any Persian would take the trouble to translate from the Sanscrit a work which was itself a translation from the Persian. I therefore think the proper reading must be J\u0101tak. The two words might easily be confounded in writing.\n\nWith reference to A. F.'s remark about the five planets being in aspect to the Moon, it may be pointed out that they are not all in one house, so that they all cannot have the same aspect. It will be remembered that the Sun was regarded as a planet by the ancients.\n\n1 It does not appear that Akbar ever possessed 22 kingdoms. His \u1e63\u016bbahs (provinces) were originally twelve and became fifteen by the conquest of Berar, Kh\u0101ndesh, and Ahmadnagar. (Jarrett II. 115). However on the same page, A. F. speaks of hoping to add Central Asia and Persia, etc., to the list. It is curious that under Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, the provinces numbered 22. (Tieffenthaler Berlin, 1786. I. 66). Bernier's list makes the number 20 only, but he includes Bengal and Orissa as one.\n\nIn the Brhajj\u0101lakam referred to in the previous note, the Sanscrit gl\u014dka is thus given:\n\nThis may, apparently, be translated as follows\u2014\"If the Ascendant\" (i.e., the horoscope or point on the eastern horizon) \"or the Moon be in Varg\u014dttama, and four or more planets, exclusive of the Moon, be in aspect thereto, the Native will be king of two-and-twenty kingdoms.\"\n\nThe editor proceeds to explain in Bengali, how this figure is arrived at; viz., by making different combinations of the planets. The figure 44 is reached by counting 22 for the case of the Ascendant's being in Varg\u014dttama and being aspected by the planets, and 22 for the similar case of the Moon.\n\nWe are told that by some other manipulation of the figures, the number of kingdoms may rise to 528, i.e., $22 \\times 24$. Apparently A.F. claims more than 22 for Akbar and reaches at least 44,\u2014for he says that both the Ascendant and the Moon are in nubhahr, though, to be sure, he does not say that both are aspected by five planets. Apparently he shrinks from specifying the number of the kingdoms just as he shrinks from telling us anything about the time of Akbar's death. It is a case of Imperium sine fine dedi. Nor does A.F. take notice of the fact that the gl\u014dka speaks of \"Varg\u014dttama,\"\u2014a word which means chief of a class and is only applied to three out of the nine nav\u0101\u1e43sa positions.\nAnd in this holy nativity, the lord of the ascendant (the Sun) is in the Third House. If the Native have a brother, the latter will not be long-lived but many devoted friends will gather round him (the Native) and he will be beneficent, bounteous (or forgiving) and powerful and will enjoy sovereignty, free from calamity, and prosperity without end.\n\nThe lord of the Second House (Mercury) is in the Third and so, he (the Native) will do great things and will bring wondrous works to pass. He will devise laws of dominion and wisdom and be a terror to the evil-minded, and no alarm on this account will touch the hem of his lofty spirit.\n\nThe lord of the Third House is in the Second. The Native will assist the helpless and downcast, and deal benignantly with well-disposed kindred. And all those who walk rightly will experience his bounty and benevolence, and will gather fruits from the gardens of his bounties and liberalities. It is certain that if the lord of the Third House be auspicious, the Native will attain great sovereignty.\n\nNow in this holy nativity, the Lesser Fortune (Venus) is lord\n\n---\n\n1 See to this effect the Bengali astrological work, Jyotish Park\u0101sh, Part II. 55.\n\n2 The text has \u0633\u064e\u062f\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0652\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652 sa'd-i-akbar, i.e., the Lesser Fortune or Venus, but the editors admit that eight out of their nine authorities read sa'd-i-akbar (Jupiter.) They have adopted the reading of a single MS. because Venus and not Jupiter is lord of Libra, i.e., the Third House. I think this reason sufficient for the emendation, although A. F.'s language where he speaks of the planet's signifying a \"great Khil\u0101fat and majestic Government\" agrees better with Jupiter and would seem to imply that Jupiter was in his thoughts. However Venus is a much more respectable and important divinity with Orientals than she is in the West. She is called the planet of Isl\u0101m (B\u0101dsch\u0101hnam\u0101 102, 1.2) and she ruled over Arabia\u2014so the reference to the Khil\u0101fat may not be inappropriate. According to the Dabist\u0101n (III. 107 trans.) Mu\u1e25ammad worshipped Venus and for this reason, fixed Friday for the sacred day, \"as he would not reveal the meaning to the common people, he kept it secret.\" This explanation of the choice of Friday for the sacred day is contrary to that commonly received, which is that Friday was the most excellent of days because the last of Creation and that on which man was made. Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n's horoscope was under Libra and also Jah\u0101ng\u012br's. It is just possible that A. F. may have been thinking of Saturn who is in his exaltation in Libra.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE HOROSCOPE OF AUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS WHICH WAS CAST BY THE ERUDITE OF THE AGE, 'AZDU-D-DAULAH\u00b9 AMIR FATHU-L-LAH OF SHIRAZ.\n\nIn the year in which the pattern of natural philosophers, sifted flour of erudition-amassing doctors, delicate balance of sciences, key of the locks of opinions, raised to lofty dignities, expounder of material truths, assayer\u00b2 of the jewels of verity, solver of Greek problems, render of the curtain between light and darkness, discerner of the stations and motions of earthly and heavenly bodies, soaring phoenix ('anq\u0101'), very learned of the Age, 'Azdu-d-daulah Amir Fathu-l-l\u0101h of Shiraz, under the guidance of good fortune, was elevated to the pedestal of the lofty throne and obtained a robe of honour, together with degrees of exaltation and steps of advancement,\u2014the writer of this noble volume one day remarked to him that the horoscopes of the auspicious nativity were discrepant, and expressed the hope that he would examine them according to the true nam\u012bd\u0101r, and weigh them in the trutine of inquiry. The honoured Mir, having after complete investigation, deduced the horoscope from the Persian rules and the Greek canon, found that the birth was in Leo. As in the opinion of the writer, this is the most reliable horoscope, he gives its figure here, together with some specimens of the prognostications.\n\n\u00b9 Arm of the State. From Shiraz, he went to the Deccan and joined Akbar's Court in 991=1583. We find Akbar consulting him as an astrologer, about the troubles in Gujrat (Akbarnama III, 431). Perhaps the title 'Azdu-d-daulah was given to or assumed by Fathu-l-l\u0101h in allusion to the Buyide prince, 'Azdu-d-daulah Alp Arslan, who reigned in Khur\u0101s\u0101n in the 10th century and was a patron of astronomers. (See S\u00e9billot). There is a Canon (Set of Tables) named after him, 'Azad\u012b. (See Jarrett II. 8 and Blochmann 33n).\n\n\u00b2 He arranged the coinage in the 29th year, 1585 (Blochmann 33).\nAt first sight, it appears as if the entries in this diagram were not correct, for Mercury is set down as being in Virgo, whereas the text (33 l.7.) describes him as in 25\u00b0 24' Libra. Similarly the Dragon's Tail (Katabibazon) is in Leo, and not in Cancer; and the Sun (Text 33 l.9. fr. foot) in Scorpio and not in Libra.\n\nBut it should be remembered that the Houses or compartments of the figure are mundane Houses (Houses of the horoscope) and so, overlap the Signs. All that is meant by putting the name of a Sign into one of the Compartments is that the cusp or boundary of the House is in that Sign. The First House for example does not begin till nearly the last degree (viz., 28\u00b0) of Leo. Apparently the entries in the figure misled Kavi R\u0101j Shy\u0101mal D\u0101s, for he speaks of some of the horoscopes as marking the Sun in Libra and others in Scorpio. But three out of the four put the Sun in Scorpio and probably the fourth (Jotik Rai\u2019s) does so, although details are not given. It is indeed stated in this that the Sun, Saturn and Mercury are all in one Sign, and we are told that the latter two are in Libra but perhaps all that is meant is, that the three are in the same House, viz., the Third.\n\n\\[ \\text{Hail\u0101j awwal jus\u016b-i-ijtim\u0101'}. \\] Apparently this means that the first hyleg is the degree or place where the conjunction of the Sun and Moon took\nThe cusp\\(^1\\) of the glorious Ascendant in this holy horoscope which is a masterpiece of the revolutions of the stars and planets, is \\(28^\\circ 36'\\) Leo. The angles\\(^2\\) are in Fixed Signs and as the cusp of the fortunate-starred Ascendant is in the Sun\u2019s House, no planet is its dominant. It is the term of Mars, and Jupiter is lord of the triplicity,\\(^3\\) in companionship with the Sun and with Saturn in attendance.\n\nplace before the birth. Perhaps hyleg is here to be taken to mean duration of life. The Lucknow ed. and MS. 564 contain more details in this compartment and also in the other squares of the figure.\n\nThey write \u201cHyleg; first, the \u201cdegree of anterior conjunction; \u201cthen the Part of Fortune; then \u201cthe degree of the Ascendant\u2019s \u201ckadhd\u0101d\u0101; with reference to the \u201chyleg, Saturn is first, then Jupiter; \u201cand with reference to the Part of \u201cFortune, Mercury, then Jupiter, \u201cthen Saturn: and with reference \u201cto the degree of the Ascendant, \u201cfirst the Sun, then Mars, then \u201cSaturn.\u201d In fact they insert here the words of the beginning of p. 38 of the text. Perhaps A. F. or Fat\u1e25\u016b-l-l\u0101h was referring to the nam\u016bd\u0101r of Zoroaster. (See Prolegomena text 149 and trans. 204). The central entry in the diagram of our text appears inconsistent with the description at page 38 where Saturn is placed before Jupiter as regards the hyleg.\n\nThe horoscope diagrams in the Lucknow ed. and in some of the MSS. contain many abbreviations. The Lucknow ed. explains some of them, but the best account of the subject that I have seen is the tract entitled \u201cAnonymus Persa de Siglia Arabum et Persarum astronomicia\u201d which was found at Constantinople by J. Greaves (Grarius) the Oxford Professor and published in 1648, at the end of his Persian Grammar. The tract might well be republished for it is rare. Dr. Weber was unable to meet with it.\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0632\u064c markaz. This ordinarily means centre. Mar\u0101kaz-i-mu\u1e25aqqaq, true centres, is the name given to a method used by Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b for determining the limits of the twelve Houses. (See Ulugh Beg\u2019s Prolegomena 142, S\u00e9dillot 198.) But here the word means, I think, cusp, the boundary of a House. (See Dict. of T.Ts. I. III. 1.4.) Markaz is derived, from rak\u1e63 and, according to Lane means \u201ca place where a spear or other thing is stuck in the ground upright.\u201d Apparently the word cusp which comes from cuspis, the point of a spear, is a translation of the Arabic term. There is no Greek astrological term corresponding to it, so far as I know.\n\n\\(^2\\) Q\u0101\u2019imu-l-aut\u0101d ittifaq uft\u0101da. The meaning is, apparently, that the four angles or cardinal points of the horoscope (viz., the First, Fourth, Seventh and Tenth Houses) are Fixed Signs, viz., Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius and Taurus.\n\n\\(^3\\) Apparently Jupiter and not the Sun, is lord of the triplicity (it is the fiery one) because the birth took place at night.\nThere are the face and *darij\u0101n*\u00b9 of Mars, the *nuhbahr* of Jupiter, *\u0101darj\u0101n* and *haftbahr*\u00b2 of Mars, twelfth of the Moon and detriment\u00b3 of Saturn. The degree is masculine and lucid, free from misfortune. The Sun is dominant over the Ascendant with intent towards an alliance with Saturn. Venus is in 26\u00b0 28' 37\" Virgo. Admittedly the Part\u2074 of children is 24\u00b0 23' (Virgo); that of wealth, 25\u00b0 7'; that of father's death 24\u00b0 23'; that of brethren 8\u00b0 47'; and that of the number of brethren 14\u00b0 12' Virgo.\n\nThe cusp of the Second House is 28\u00b0 43' Virgo; it is the House and exaltation of Mercury, and term of Saturn. The Moon is master of the triplicity in companionship with Venus and the *doryphory*\u2075 of Mars. There are the face and *nuhbahr* of Mercury, *darij\u0101n* of Venus, *\u0101darj\u0101n* of the Moon, twelfth of the Sun, *haftbahr* and fall of Venus and detriment of Jupiter. The Moon is dominant over the House. The degree is masculine, void of darkness or light, of good or bad fortune. Jupiter is posited in 15\u00b0 13' 37\" and Mercury in 25\u00b0 24' Libra. The Part of hope is 12\u00b0 53'; that of victory and conquest is 1\u00b0 17' Libra. The place of anterior conjunction is 24\u00b0 50' Libra.\n\nThe cusp of the Third House is 28\u00b0 1' Libra. It is the House of Venus, exaltation of Saturn, term of Mars, and Mercury is lord of the (aerial) triplicity in companionship with Saturn and attended by Jupiter. There are the face of Jupiter, the *darij\u0101n*, *nuhbahr*,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 This is the third *darij\u0101n* or *drekk\u0101na* (decanate) of Leo. A Table in the Bengali astrological work *Var\u0101ha Mihira* (38) gives a list of all the *drekk\u0101na*.\n\n\u00b2 This is the Sanscrit *sapt\u0101\u1e41ca*. It is described in Bengali books on Astrology and is, apparently, an arrangement of the hours of the week. It is thus a form of the *ahargana*.\n\n\u00b3 *Jly wab\u0101l*. When a planet is in a Sign opposite to his House, he is said to be in his detriment. Thus Leo is the detriment of Saturn, because it is opposite to (six Houses, 180\u00b0 away from) his House, Aquarius. That *wab\u0101l* corresponds to *detriment* appears, among other things, from the fact that the letter *l\u0101m* denotes the *opposite aspect* in astrology. This is because the Arabs use the last letter of a word as its abbreviation instead of its first as with us.\n\n\u2074 *sahm*, pl. *sah\u0101m*, properly means an arrow, sc. a divining-arrow, and hence, a lot or part. European astrologers portion out the Signs of the Zodiac into *Parts*. Haly and Guido Bonatus have much to say about the various *partes* and especially about the *Pars Fortunae*. (See Dict. of T.Ts. 698, s.v. *Saham*.)\n\n\u2075 I borrow this word from Ashmand. It seems to correspond to *khidmat*.\ntwelfth and *haftbahr* of Mercury, *\u0101darj\u0101n* and fall of the Sun, and detriment of Mars. Saturn is paramount over this House. The degree is feminine, lucid, and void of good or bad fortune. Saturn is in $10^\\circ 40' 33''$ Scorpio. The Part of Fate is $17^\\circ 50'$ Scorpio. The Part of good Fortune, according to Ptolemy\\(^1\\) and Muhyi'd-d\u012bn Maghribi,\\(^2\\) is $18^\\circ 9'$ Scorpio. The Part of true friends and of welfare\\(^3\\) (?) and that of servants are admittedly $23^\\circ 12'$. The Part of ailments is admittedly $17^\\circ 21'$. The Sun is $0^\\circ 45' 57''$ Scorpio.\n\nThe cusp of the Fourth House is $27^\\circ 21'$ Scorpio. This is a cardinal point (angle) and is the House of Mars, term of Saturn, face, twelfth and detriment of Venus. The Lord of the triplicity is Mars in companionship with Venus and attended by the Moon, and there are the *darij\u0101n* of Mercury and the *nuhbahr* and *haftbahr* of Jupiter. Mars is paramount over this House. The degree is masculine, fixed (*qayyima*) and void of good or bad fortune. The Part of land journeys is $12^\\circ 28'$ Sagittarius. The Part of law-suits is $28^\\circ 32$ Scorpio.\n\nThe cusp of the Fifth House is $27^\\circ 11'$ Sagittarius. It is the House and *nuhbahr* of Jupiter and the exaltation of the Dragon's Tail (Katabibazon), the term of Mars and face of Saturn; the lord of the triplicity is Jupiter in companionship with the Sun and with Saturn in attendance. There are the Suu's *darij\u0101n*, the *\u0101darj\u0101n* of Venus, the twelfth of Mars, the *nuhbahr* of Jupiter and *haftbahr* of Saturn, the fall of the Dragon's Head (Anabibazon) and the detriment of Mercury. Jupiter is paramount over the House with an inclination for the alliance of Saturn. This degree is masculine, fixed and void of good or bad fortune. The Part of sovereignty and territory is $28^\\circ 39'$ Sagittarius. Cygnus and Aquila are in $25^\\circ$ Capricorn and Mars is in $10^\\circ 48' 23''$. The Moon is in $19^\\circ 48'' 14'$ Capricorn.\n\nThe cusp of the Sixth House is $26^\\circ 46'$ Capricorn. It is the House of Saturn, exaltation and term of Mars and face of the Sun. The Moon is master of the triplicity in companionship with Venus\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is stated, later on, that most authorities put it in the 10th House.\n\n\\(^2\\) (See Jarret III. 20n.) Though originally from the West and hence called *Maghribi*, he eventually set-\n\n\\(^3\\) The Text is doubtful here.\nand attended by Mars. There are the *darij\u0101n* and *nuhbahr* of Mercury, *\u0101darj\u0101n* and twelfth and fall of Jupiter, the *haftbahr* and detriment of the Moon. Mars is paramount over this House in companionship with Saturn and the Moon. The degree is masculine, lucid and unfortunate. The Dragon's Head is $27^\\circ 29' 13''$ Aquarius. The Part of war\\(^1\\) and of captives is $24^\\circ 44'$ Capricorn. The Part of the deaths of brethren is $2^\\circ 1'$ Aquarius.\n\nThe cusp of the Seventh House is $28^\\circ 36'$ Aquarius. It is the House and twelfth and term of Saturn. The lord of the triplicity is Mercury in companionship with Saturn and attended by Jupiter. There are the face of the Moon, the *darij\u0101n* of Venus, *\u0101darj\u0101n* and *nuhbahr* of Mercury, *haftbahr* of Jupiter and detriment of the Sun. Saturn is paramount over this House in companionship with Mercury and with inclination to the companionship of Jupiter. The degree is masculine, dark and void of good or bad fortune. The Part of friendship, constancy, firmness and love is $20^\\circ 8'$ Pisces.\n\nThe cusp of the Eighth House is $28^\\circ 43'$ Pisces. It is the House and *nuhbahr* of Jupiter, exaltation of Venus, term,\\(^2\\) face, *darij\u0101n* and *\u0101darj\u0101n* of Mars who is lord of the triplicity in companionship with Venus and the *doryphory* of the Moon. It is the term, *haftbahr* and twelfth of Saturn and the fall of Mercury. Venus is paramount over this House in companionship with Mars and with inclination to alliance with the Moon. The degree is masculine, fixed, and void of good or evil fortune. The Part of excellence is $20^\\circ 8'$ Aries and the Part of valour $2^\\circ 53'$ of the same.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *aljaish*. The Lucknow ed. reads \u062d\u0628\u0633 *habe*, 'prison.' So does MS. No. 564, and this is, perhaps, the correct reading, it being coupled with prisoners (*alas\u0101r\u0101*). However, prisoners in the sense of captives or prisoners of war, may be meant and the reading in the text be right.\n\n\\(^2\\) There appears to be a mistake in the text, for this same degree is said to be both the term of Mars and the term of Saturn. This coincidence is, I believe, impossible. Probably the second statement is wrong for, according to Bengali books on astrology, $28^\\circ$ Pisces falls within the term of Mars. The confusion may perhaps be due to A.F.'s use of two classifications of terms. According to the old classification, quoted by Cardan, the last two degrees of Pisces belong to the term of Saturn.\nThe cusp of the Ninth House is $28^\\circ 1'$ Aries. It is the House of Mars, the exaltation\\(^1\\) of the Sun, the term,\\(^2\\) fall\\(^3\\) and \u0101darj\u0101n of Saturn, and face and detriment of Venus. The lord of the tripli-city is Jupiter, in companionship with the Sun, and the doryphory of Saturn. It is the darj\u0101n, nuhbahr, twelfth and haftbahr of Jupiter.\n\nMars is paramount over this House in companionship with Jupiter and with inclination towards alliance with Saturn. The degree is masculine, light and belonging to the deep or pitted\\(^4\\) degrees. The Part of male children is admittedly $23^\\circ 49'$ Taurus. The Part of sea-voyages is $2^\\circ 36'$. The Part of messengers\\(^5\\) is $5^\\circ$ Taurus.\n\nThe cusp of the Tenth House is $27^\\circ 21'$ Taurus. It is the House and \u0101darj\u0101n of Venus, the exaltation of the Moon who is master\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Aries is the exaltation of the Sun, but it does not occur in this Ninth House which begins at $28^\\circ$ Aries. The Sun's exaltation is $19^\\circ$ Aries (according to Bengali books, it is $10^\\circ$) and his fall is $19^\\circ$ Libra.\n\n\\(^2\\) The last five degrees of Aries are the term of Saturn, according to one classification and according to another, they are the term of Venus.\n\n\\(^3\\) There is some doubt what planet these designations are to be assigned to, but it is certain that Aries is the fall of Saturn as being opposite to Libra\u2014his House of exaltation\u2014and that, for a similar reason, it is the detriment of Venus, as being opposite to her Mansion, riz., Libra.\n\n\\(^4\\) The text has \u0627\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631 ab\u0101r. MS. 564 reads \u0627\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631 \u0101b\u0101r and explains it as the plural of \u0628\u0650\u0626\u0652\u0631 bi'r, 'a well.' Either reading is right; Lane (145) gives both forms \u0627\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631 and \u0627\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631 as plural of \u0628\u0650\u0626\u0652\u0631. See Maf\u0101t\u012bhul-'ul\u016bm, 227, l.4. (Cf. the Hebrew Beersheba, i.e., the well of the oath.) It is difficult to see the connection of wells with degrees, but Wilson (Astrological Dict.) says that certain degrees are called deep or pitted because they subject the Native to deep marks of small-pox or scars, or, according to others, cause an impediment in speech, troubles and disputes in which he is sunk as in a deep pit. Lilly (Christian Astrology 116, 2nd ed. 1659), gives a table of the various degrees, riz., masculine and feminine, light, dark, smoky, void, deep or pitted, lame or deficient and says (118) that deep or pitted degrees \"show the man at a stand in the question he asks, not knowing which way to turn himself and that he had need of help to bring him into a better condition for as a man cast in a ditch cannot easily get out without help so no more can this querent in the case he is without assistance.\" In the Astronomia (Guido Bonatus, 59) there is a table of kinds of degrees; pitted degrees are there called gradus putcales.\n\n\\(^5\\) \u0645\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645 'ml\u0101m, 'messengers' and 'messages.'

Bonatus mentions (64-)\nof the triplicity in companionship with Venus, and with attendance of Mars, the *darij\u0101n* of Saturn, the *nuhbahr* and *haftbahr* of Mercury, the twelfth term and detriment of Mars. Venus is paramount over this House in complete companionship with the Moon and in companionship with Mars. The degree is masculine, lucid and void of good or bad fortune. The Part of good fortune is admitted by all with the exception of Ptolemy and Muhyi'u-d-din Maghribi to be $9^\\circ 22'$ Gemini. The Part of reason and of speech is $9^\\circ 51'$ Gemini. The Part of disease is $25^\\circ 27'$ Gemini. The Part of male offspring is admittedly $29^\\circ 40'$ Taurus. The Part of abstinence (temperance) is $4^\\circ$ Gemini. The Part of possessions is $19^\\circ 36'$. The Part of enemies is admittedly $25^\\circ 27'$ Gemini.\n\nThe cusp of the Eleventh House is $27^\\circ 11'$ Gemini. It is the House and *nuhbahr* of Mercury and he is lord of the triplicity in companionship with Saturn and with attendance of Jupiter.

This degree is feminine and fixed, and void of good and evil fortune. The Part of the conclusions of actions and the Part of marriage are $14^\\circ$ Cancer. Mercury is paramount over this House in companionship with Saturn.\n\nThe cusp of the Twelfth House is $26^\\circ 46'$ Cancer. It is the House and face of the Moon and the exaltation, $^3$ *nuhbahr* and the *darij\u0101n* of Jupiter. It is the term and detriment of Saturn. Mars is lord of triplicity in companionship with Venus and with the Moon in attendance. It is the *\u0101darj\u0101n*, *dodecatemorion*, *haftbahr* and fall of Mars. The Moon is paramount over this House with Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Saturn. The degree is feminine, lucid and void of good or evil fortune. The Dragon's Tail is in $27^\\circ 29' 13''$ Leo.

As regards the hyleg, the kadkhud\u0101 is Saturn and then Jupi-\n\n1 Apparently there may be more than one hyleg or prorogator of life in a figure, and the meaning of the text seems to be that the first or chief hyleg is the point of anterior conjunction; that the Part of Fortune is the second hyleg; and that the Ascendant, i.e., the degree of the Ascendant, is the third.\n\nThe meaning, however, may be that the hyleg is the first or most important thing in the horoscope. This agrees with the remark in the Tetrabiblos (Ashmand, 129.) \"The inquiry into the duration of life takes precedence of all other questions as to the events subsequent to birth.\" Obviously until it is known whether the Native will grow up to maturity, it is useless to inquire what his career will be in other respects.\n\n2 juz\u016b-i-ijtim\u0101', \"point of conjunction.\" See the term explained in Dict. of T. Ts. 187 1.4, where the phrase is written and where there is a quotation from Mull\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h Barjandi's Commentary on the Tables of Ulugh Beg. One of the hylegs in use was the last conjunction of the Sun and Moon (syzygy) before the birth, and another was the last antecedent opposition of the Sun and Moon. The full phrase in astrological books, as I find from a MS. in the B.A.S.'s Library called the Jaw\u0101mi\u2018 ahk\u0101mu-n-nuj\u016bm was \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639 \u0628\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0631\u0644\u0627\u0637 juz\u016b-i-ijtim\u0101\u2018 y\u0101 istiqb\u0101l muqaddam bar wil\u0101dat, 'the point to conjunction for opposition antecedent to the birth.' The point of conjunction was presumably, the hyleg in Akbar's case, because his birth took place on the 4th day of the month and consequently shortly after a conjunction, for the Muhammadan months are lunar and begin with the new Moon, i.e., conjunction. The phrase awwal juz\u016b-i-ijtim\u0101\u2018 also occurs in the diagram (Figure III.) (36 l.9. fr. foot and 37 l.3.). S\u00e9dillot (202) translates the phrase juz\u016b-i-ijtim\u0101\u2018, (which occurs in Ulugh Beg's Prolegomena text 147 l.1.) by le degr\u00e9 de la conjonction, and the word \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0629 mutaqaddam for which muqaddam is a variant, by ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la nativit\u00e9.\n\nThe point of anterior conjunction, we are told, is posited in the Second House of the horoscope, being 24\u00b0 50' Libra and, as both Jupiter and Venus are in this House, it is possible that the conjunction referred to is that of Jupiter and Venus, i.e., the two Fortunes, and not the conjunction of the Sun and Moon. According to the second or Indian horoscope, Jupiter and Venus were in conjunction in the Second House. (text 28 l.6.)\n\n3 The meaning seems to be that as regards the duration of life, Saturn is the kadkhud\u0101 'lord of geniture,' as he is the planet with the largest orbit and his cycle is that of longevity, being a return to the Golden Age when men lived for centuries; (See Badi\u0101n\u012b, Lowe 335.) but that as regards fortune and sovereignty, Jupiter is first; and as regards the Ascendant, the Sun is pre\u00ebminent.\nter; as regards\\(^1\\) the Part of Fortune, Jupiter comes first, then Saturn; as regards the Ascendant, the Sun comes first, then Mars.\n\n\\(^1\\) \\(\\text{\u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0645\u0627\u0631} \\) az mamarr. Mamarr has the technical meaning of transit, but apparently not here.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nEXPLANATION OF THE JUDGMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS WONDEOUS HOROSCOPE WHICH IS A BRACHIAL AMULET OF THE STARS AND HEAVENS, AND THE CROWN-TALISMAN OF GENERATIONS AND CYCLES.\n\nAs the foundation of the holy horoscope has been firmly laid, it is indispensable that an explanation of a few out of its many wonderful judgments should be given.\n\nJUDGMENTS OF THE FIRST HOUSE (akh\u0101m).\n\nAs the cusp of the Ascendant is Leo which is the Sun\u2019s House, this signifies lofty genius and excellence, and that the holy frame will be strong and athletic, with a large head, broad forehead, wide chest, strength and length, courage, majesty, gravity, beauty of feature and powerful brain. As most of the degrees of the Ascendant (First House) belong to the Sign of Virgo, which is the House and exaltation of Mercury who is in the House of Venus (Libra) or Second House of the horoscope, and is near Jupiter and in his own term and triplicity, it is fitting that the Native should fall back upon his own exquisite intellect in all affairs of finance and state, and should accomplish his momentous enterprises by his own excellent plans. As the Sun is regent of the noble Ascendant in alliance with Saturn, the Native will have complete sovereignty over all the countries of India and over part of the fourth climate. And as,\n\n1 See Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u2019s Memoirs, Price 45. Jah\u0101ng\u012br states that his father was tall, and remarkable for the length of his arms and the breadth of his chest.\n\n2 \u062c\u0645\u0644\u0647 mutta\u1e63il. This word, which occurs again a few lines lower down, appears to have a technical meaning, signifying that the planet is within\n\nthe power of the rays of another planet. See Dict. of T.Ts. 1508. s.v. itti\u1e63\u0101l.\n\n3 The Sun is supposed to have special sway over the fourth climate to which Kashmir, K\u0101bul and Badakhsh\u0101n belong. Saturn rules the first climate and India. India belongs mostly to the second and third cli-\nwith reference to position,\u00b9 the Sun comes after Saturn, the empire of Hind\u016bst\u0101n will precede that of the fourth climate. And as the lord of the second cusp, viz., Mercury, is near the lord of the Ascendant (the Sun), this is a proof that prosperity and principality (m\u0101l u mulk) will be easily acquired. As the Ascendant, the Part of Fortune and the place of prior conjunction of the Sun and Moon belong to Signs possessing many planets,\u00b2 there is strong evidence of length of life and duration of sovereignty.\n\nJudgments of the Second House.\n\nAs the cusp of the Second House belongs to Virgo, which is the House of Mercury who is near the Sun, and most of it belongs to Libra, the House of Venus, and as Venus is in the Ascendant\u00b3 which is the House and exaltation of Mercury,\u2014this signifies that wealth and territory will be acquired by means of excellent contrivances and perfect reason, and that the Native will obtain the office of king. And Jupiter's being in this House in his own term, and Mercury's being near him, are a strong proof of this and\n\n\u00b9 Apparently the meaning is that, as in this horoscope the position of the Sun is posterior to that of Saturn (the latter being in Libra and the former in Scorpio), the empire of India will be acquired before that of the fourth climate. It may, however,\n\n\u00b2 The translation is doubtful; the literal rendering seems to be, \u201cSigns having many risings\u201d (of stars and planets). The Ascendant is Leo; the Part of Fortune is in the Tenth House, viz.: in 9\u00b0 22' Gemini and the degree of prior conjunction is in Libra. As according to Ptolemy and Mu\u1e25y\u012b\u2019u-d-d\u012bn Maghrib\u012b, the Part of Fortune is 18\u00b0 9' Scorpio and so is in the Third House, A.F.'s meaning may possibly be that the three things referred to all occur in the early Houses of the horoscope.\n\n\u00b3 Venus is in 26\u00b0 23' 37\" Virgo but as this part of Virgo falls into the First House of the horoscope, Venus is said to be in the Ascendant.\nalso that the Viziers will manage affairs by the abounding reason of the Native and not by their own plans. On the contrary, their ideas will not endure in the presence of the designs of the Lord of the Age. And as the lord of the Second House (Mercury) is in the Ascendant, he (the Native) will collect countless treasures; and as Jupiter is in this House, he will spend his wealth in ways pleasing to God, and will walk in God's paths and his property will increase daily.\n\nAnd the fact of Jupiter's being in his own term, is a proof of long life, so that he will have honoured grandchildren and these fortunate ones will grow up under his discipline.\n\nAs Saturn is in the Second House and in exaltation, harm will never come to his (the Native's) treasures. The hyleg which is the degree of first conjunction (qu. conjunction prior to the nativity?) is in this House and is a strong proof of the above statement. The kadkhud\u0101 (lord of the geniture) which is Saturn and is in exaltation, and his companion Jupiter having come into this House, give to the holy life the influences of two kadkhud\u0101s. Mars is the third (kadkhud\u0101) so that the Native will exceed the natural period of life, viz., 120 years. The Moon's being paramount over this House is another corroboration of the well-groundedness of this blessing.\n\n---\n\n1 Perhaps Saturn is meant; Libra is his House of exaltation. If so, the word t\u0101li must be taken not to mean ascendant but the whole of the horoscope. It may also be the Moon, as she is described as being paramount over the Second House.\n\n2 120 years was considered by astrologers and doctors the natural period of a man's life. See Ibn Khald\u016bn's Prolegomena, (Notices et Extraits.) XIX, 347. \"Selon les m\u00e9decins et les astrologues, la vie naturelle de l'homme est de cent vingt ans, de l'esp\u00e8ce que ceux-ci nomment grandes ann\u00e9es humaines.\" Similarly A. F. says, (Blochmann 121) \"The elephant, like man, lives to an age of one hundred and twenty years.\" A. F. seems actually to have hoped that Akbar would outlive 120 years and that he himself might have the honour of recording the events of that period. (Jarrett III. 416.) Kishwarkhud\u0101, 'world's lord,' (Jarrett II, 258, 1.3) seems to mean Akbar himself and not his dynasty. Var\u0101ha Mihira says (B\u1e5bhat J\u0101taka I. ver. 63) that 120 years and 5 days is the maximum of the life of men and elephants. B\u0101d\u0101m\u012b tells us (Lowe 335) that the Jog\u012bs promised Akbar he would live three or four times as long as ordinary men. No doubt they referred to the three kadkhud\u0101s spoken of by A. F. (See also Alb\u012br\u016bn\u012b on the length of human life. Chronicle of Ancient Nations, 90.) The three kadkhud\u0101s might give a total of nearly a thousand\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nJUDGMENTS OF THE THIRD HOUSE.\n\nAs the lord of the Ascendant (the Sun) is in the Third House, this signifies perfect mildness, sedateness, constancy and reverence and the succouring of kinsmen. But this tribe, out of shortsightedness, will not be single-minded. However as that centre (markaz) where the lord of the Ascendant (Scorpio) is, is the House of Mars and also his triplicity, term, decanate, \u0101darj\u0101n and darj\u0101n, and as he himself is in the Fifth House which is his House of exaltation\u00b9 and his gaudium (fara\u1e6d) and is the triplicity and face of Jupiter, and the \u0101darj\u0101n of the lord of the Ascendant,\u2014the improper thoughts of this faction will become a cause of increased glory and enhanced dominion to the Native. And as the beginnings of the Third House which have to do with brethren, are a station\u00b2 of the Sun\u2019s majesty, this signifies that brethren will be of no account alongside the glory of the holy being (Akbar) and that they will quaff the cup of anguish to the dregs. The middle and last portions of the Third House, which signify allies and helpers\u00b3 are, according to Ptolemy, the Part of Fortune and they are also the face of the Sun and he is co-partner with the kadkhud\u0101 (Saturn). This signifies that friends and loyalists will be on the carpet of union (lit: one colour) and devotion, and be steadfast in respect, and will be advanced by the Native to prosperity and wealth. And as this place of the Third House has connection with Mars who is in his exaltation, and that House is the gaudium and House of Saturn who\n\nyears, according to Bad\u0101oni, one of the periods mentioned by the Jog\u012bs, for it appears from the Libellus Isagogicus of Alchabitius, that the maximum of Saturn\u2019s years, (Fridaria) is 465, of Jupiter\u2019s 264, and of Mars\u2019, the same; 465+264+264=993. 120 was the maximum of the Fridaria bestowed by the Sun. As a matter of fact, Akbar did not reach even the Scriptural three-score and ten,\u2014dying on 13th October, 1605, (Elphinstone), in his climacteric (63 years,) just before the anniversary of his birth 15th October, 1542.\n\n\u00b9 Vis., that of Capricornus into which the Fifth House of the figure extends.\n\n\u00b2 Maurid-i-satwat-i-naiyir-i-\u2018a\u1e93am.\n\nThe Third House begins at 28\u00b0 1\u2032 Libra, but the allusion is probably to the Sun\u2019s being in the first degree, 0\u00b0 45\u2032 57\u2033 Scorpio; for the entry of a planet into a new Sign is a time of special power and suspiciousness. See Akbarn\u0101ma I, 55, l.2 fr. foot, in the account of Enoch.\n\n\u00b3 The Text and all authorities read \u0627\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646 i\u1e25w\u0101n, \u2018brothers,\u2019 but the editors propose to read a\u2018w\u0101n, \u2018allies or helpers,\u2019 and no doubt this is the true reading. See Akbarn\u0101ma\nis a foremost *kadkhud\u0101* and who is also in his exaltation,\u2014friends will always be in honour and glory. And as Saturn who is a *kadkhud\u0101* and is in exaltation, is paramount in the House, this is a convincing proof of these things. And the lord (Mars) of the Third House being in the Fifth, is a proof of the establishment of noble children, and also signifies that there will be travelling and short excursions which will be provocative of joy.\n\nOne of the wonderful things is that the part of the other world, according to all, and the Part of Fortune, according to Ptolemy and Mu\u1e25y\u012b\u2019u-d-din Maghrib\u012b, are in one place; to wit, 18\u00b0 Scorpio in the Third House. This rarely occurs in horoscopes, and forcibly indicates that good fortune upon good fortune will come in succession from the other world, and is also strong evidence for information about hidden matters, so that the enlightened mind of the Native will be a rendezvous of mysteries.\n\n**Judgments of the Fourth House.**\n\nAs Mars is lord of the cusp (*markaz*) of this House, and he is in his exaltation, face, and his own trigon (*mu\u1e63allaga*) and is dominant\n\n---\n\n26 ll.3 and 17 and \u2018Abdu-l-\u1e25am\u012bd\u2019s *B\u0101dh\u0101h\u0101n\u0101ma* 25 and 27.\n\n\u2018Abdu-l-\u1e25am\u012bd of L\u0101hor is said to have been a pupil of Abu-l-fa\u017cl (See Rieu\u2019s Catalogue I. 280, quoting S\u0101lib), and certainly has done his best to imitate A. F.\u2019s turgidities. He himself tells us that he was chosen by Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n to be his Court historian on account of his being a proficient in the style of Abu-l-fa\u017cl. It goes without saying that writing under Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, he is a much straiter Musulm\u0101n than his master. The lengthy account of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s horoscope which he gives, was drawn up by Mull\u0101 \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-l-mulk of Tun in Khur\u0101s\u0101n who afterwards got the title of F\u0101\u017cil Kh\u0101n. (*B\u0101dh\u0101h\u0101n\u0101ma* 13). Apparently the conjunction of planets which led to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s receiving the title of Second Lord of conjunc-\n\ntion (the first being T\u012bm\u016br) took place in 991 (1585), nine years before Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s birth. Great importance was attached to Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s having been born in the thousandth year of the Hijra. He was born under Libra the sign under which the Prophet was born.\n\n1 Naql means also \u2018zest to wine,\u2019 etc.\n\n2 See Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n\u2019s horoscope for a similar expression. *B\u0101dh\u0101h\u0101n\u0101ma* 20 l.5.\n\n3 This does not seem quite accurate. In the previous account of the Houses, we are told that the Part of the other world is 17\u00b0 50\u2032 Scorpio and that of Fortune, according to Ptolemy and Mu\u1e25y\u012b\u2019u-d-d\u012bn is 18\u00b0 9\u2032 Scorpio.\n\n4 We are told above that Mars is posited in 10\u00b0 48\u2032 23\u2033 Capricorn which is his House of exaltation. The Fourth House begins at 27\u00b0 21\u2032 Scorpio which is Mars\u2019 mansion.\nover this House and it is the term of Jupiter, what is signified is that in the beginning of his (the Native's) career territory will come into possession through the exertions of military officers. And as this House is a Fixed Sign, and its lord (Mars) is in exaltation and has a beneficent aspect, territory will continually be coming into the possession of the King's servants and whatever so comes will remain there permanently.\n\nAs the 8th and 4th of the degrees which belong to the beginning of Scorpio are Gemini (Jauz\u0101') whose lord (Mercury) is occulted by the Sun's rays, this signifies that when the Native shall arrive at years of discretion, the might of his intellect will become displayed,\n\n1 Apparently the meaning is that Mars is in the Fifth House, in Capricorn, and so has the beneficent trine aspect to the First House, that is, the House of the Native's life.\n\n2 Auliya-i-daulat. This seems an honorific circumlocution for the king himself, but may mean that Akbar was then a minor, and that conquests were made by his regent, Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n.\n\n3 This is a difficult passage, and I am uncertain of the meaning. Perhaps the text is corrupt, but all the MSS. I have examined give the same reading with the apparently unimportant difference that some omit the conjunction u between hash\u016bm and cah\u0101rum. The difficulty lies in understanding how the constellation Gemini comes in here. Jauz\u0101' means Orion as well as Gemini, but the latter seems intended here, for A.F., goes on to speak of its lord being occulted by the Sun and this can only refer to Mercury who is the lord of Gemini. It is possible that the meaning is that Gemini is the Eighth and Fourth House from the beginning of Scorpio, i.e., is Eight Houses apart on one side of the Third House, to which the first degrees of Scorpio belong, and Four Houses apart on the other. It is also possible that A.F. has confounded Jauz\u0101', Orion, with Jauz\u0101', Gemini. But I rather think that by Jauz\u0101' may be meant the \"lesser Twins,\" viz., the stars \u03b2 and \u03b4 Scorpionis. See Sayce's \"Higher Criticism and the Monuments,\" p. 69n. where Professor Hommel is quoted as stating that there are three sets of Twins, viz., Castor and Pollux in Gemini, the lesser Twins in Scorpio and the lesser Twins in Aries. Mercury is in 25\u00b0 24' Libra of the horoscope, and so is occulted or immersed in the rays of the Sun which is posited in the first degrees of Scorpio. But I do not see why the first degrees of Scorpio are referred to by A.F., in his description of the Fourth House, for that begins near the end of Scorpio. Perhaps awal is a mistake for \u0101hir. The Fourth House is that of the father and so may deal with his death. It is also that of lords and states.\nand that his honoured\u00b9 father will at this time, have his face turned towards the hidden and inner world and will depart to the eternal city. As most of this House belongs to Sagittarius and the lord of the term (Jupiter) is in the Second House of the horoscope, the Native will be affectionate and grateful to his father and will receive an appanage\u00b2 from his dominions.\n\n**Judgments of the Fifth House.**\n\nAs the lord of most of the Third House which is connected with lovers and sincere friends and helpers, to wit, Mars, is in the Fifth and in exaltation, this signifies the glorious condition of the sons of the Native and their sincerity and affection. And as Saturn is paramount over this House, is in exaltation and in his own triplicity and is a kadkhud\u0101,\u2014and as Jupiter is in his face and triplicity and is associated with the kadkhud\u0101 (Saturn) and is lord of the cusp of this House,\u2014this signifies that the sons of the Native will be fortunate and be defenders of the State and that they will not remove the head of respect from the plane of well-pleasing. Aquila, who is of the constitution of Mars, and Jupiter and Cygnus, who is of the constitution of Jupiter and Venus, are in this House and forcibly indicate an abundant catch (\u1e63a\u012bd) of pleasure and auspiciousness.\n\n**Judgments of the Sixth House.**\n\nAs the master (Saturn) of this House (Capricorn) is in his exaltation, and the Dragon\u2019s Head is in this House, they signify the lasting sovereignty of the Native and the acquisition of abundant\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Hum\u0101y\u016bn was killed by an accident when Akbar was little over thirteen. I suppose the meaning is that when Akbar was born his intellect, represented by Mercury, was subject to his father, but that when he came to the age of puberty, it emerged.\n\n\u00b2 This refers to the fact that Jal\u0101l-\u0101b\u0101d was assigned by Hum\u0101y\u016bn for Akbar\u2019s maintenance. See quotation from the Mir\u0101t \u0100ft\u0101bn\u0101ma of Sh\u0101h Naw\u0101z Kh\u0101n in Kan\u012b L\u0101l D\u0101s\u2019 paper J. A. S. B. for 1886, p. 83. See also, what is more to the point, Akbar-n\u0101ma I, 315, where we are told that the servants and properties of his deceased uncle Hind\u0101l, including Ghazn\u012b, &c., were made over to Akbar when he was ten years old. Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d used to be called J\u016bj Sh\u0101h\u012b and was named after Akbar (Jal\u0101lu-d-din). See Akbar-n\u0101ma I. 200 l.8 from foot.\nwealth and property, and permanence of elemental health, and equability of disposition. Should a little sickness affect the hem of his holy constitution, it will speedily terminate in perfect health. And as Mars is paramount over this House, in co-partnership with Saturn, and both are in exaltation, there will be numerous auspicious servants\\(^1\\) and attendants.\n\n**Judgments of the Seventh House.**\n\nAs the lord of the cusp of the Seventh\\(^2\\) House is Saturn\\(^3\\) and he is in exaltation, the Native will in his first youth, marry\\(^4\\) chaste veiled ones from the ruling families of India. And as Saturn is in the Second House,\\(^5\\) this may indicate that those chaste, curtained and holy ones will belong to his tributary and wealth-increasing princes. And as the Part of friendship and love is this House, this signifies increasing relish of friendship and love, especially as the Part of affection is in Pisces which is the House of Jupiter and the exaltation of Venus.\n\n**Judgments of the Eighth House.**\n\nAs the cusp of this House belongs to Pisces and its lord, Jupiter, is in the Second, in his own term and triplicity and the Part\\(^6\\) of excellence is in this House, and as Venus is paramount over this House in co-partnership with Mars who is in exaltation,\u2014this signifies the absence of fear\\(^7\\) and danger, and the being rendered safe by the protection and defence of God.\n\n**Judgments of the Ninth House.**\n\nAs the cusp of this House is in the Sign of Aries and its lord, Mars, is in his exaltation and gaudium (farah) and is dominant over\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Sixth House is that of servants.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Seventh is the House of marriage.\n\n\\(^3\\) Saturn rules India.\n\n\\(^4\\) In 969 (1562) i.e., when Akbar was in his twentieth year, he married Bih\u0101r\u012b Mal\u2019s daughter. We do not hear of any other marriages in early youth with Indian ladies, but Bad\u0101oni (Lowe 211) tells us that Akbar said he had on coming of age, married many wives, both free-born and slaves, and had not restricted himself to the legal number of four.\n\n\\(^5\\) The Second is the House of wealth.\n\n\\(^6\\) Perhaps this is the pars nobilitatis of Guido Bonatus and which appears to be 19\u00b0 Aries i.e., the Sun\u2019s exaltation.\n\n\\(^7\\) The Eighth House is a House of misfortunes, death, etc.\nthis House, the Native will reap benefit from travel,\\(^1\\) and the journeys which take place, will be accompanied by acquisition of territory.\n\n**Judgments of the Tenth House.**\n\nAs the cusp of this House belongs to Taurus, which is the House of Venus, and she is dominant over it and is in the Ascendant, this signifies perfect felicity and general superiority, which is an expression for a great kingship; also that this sublime dignity will long be in the possession of the Native, especially as this House is the exaltation of the Moon. And the Moon is in an aspect\\(^2\\) towards this House and towards the Ascendant which is one of entire friendship. And as the Part of Fortune is, by the opinion of the majority, in this House, this signifies perfect fortune and increase of State, and that the Native will spend most of his days in managing and arranging the affairs of Church and State. And as the Part of reason and speech is in this House, it signifies that his reason and speech will be king of reasons and at the head of utterances. Much too of the specialties of Venus, who is lord of pleasure and joy, will be bestowed on him.\n\n**Judgments of the Eleventh House.**\n\nAs the cusp of this House belongs to Gemini and its regent (Mercury) is in the Second House, which is that of wealth, this signifies that the hopes which he forms with regard to fortune and territory will be realized to his heart's desire. It also proves that he will have sincere friends and that the masters of wisdom and knowledge will arrive at high rank in his service. And as the Part of the conclusions of actions is in this House, this signifies that his hopes\\(^3\\) and desires will have a happy termination.\n\n**Judgment of the Twelfth House.**\n\nAs the cusp of this House belongs to Cancer and its lord, the Moon, is in detriment\\(^4\\) and gaudium (farah), this proves that the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Ninth is a House of travels.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Moon is in the Fifth House vis., 19\u00b0 48' 14\" Capricorn and so she is in trine to the First and Tenth Houses.\n\n\\(^3\\) The Eleventh House is that of hopes.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Moon is in the Fifth House in 19\u00b0 48' 14\" Capricorn and so is in detriment as being in the Sign opposite to her Mansion, viz., Cancer. The Twelfth is the House of private enemies and a House of misfortune. Had the Moon been in it, this would\nenemies of the State will be constantly in adversity and distress to whatever extent may be agreeable to the Native. And the fact of the Dragon's Tail \\(^1\\) (Katabibazon or Zanab) being there in the first degree, is strong evidence of this. And as the Part of knowledge and clemency is in this House, it signifies that the Native will, together with his insight (into character), be clement and forgiving to the short-sighted and cross-grained ones. And patience, breadth of view and general benevolence will be among his necessary attributes.\n\nMay Almighty God prolong the life of the Lord of Fortune for generations and cycles, since the attributes of greatness,\u2014which are the root and flower of universal sovereignty and world-adornment, and are a cause of capturing the hearts of friends and foes, and attract souls and knit together the thoughts of high and low,\u2014are revealed in all their perfection and (as it were) on an open highway (Praise be to the gracious God for it) in the aggregation of refined qualities of this Doctor of the High School of Unity; and have made him by his idiosyncracy and fundamental nature, sole owner of sublime dignity and peculiar grace. And of a certainty, all those admirable qualities and dispositions have, without effort or vaunting, become the blissful possession of this celestial Being, so that from this fountain-head of justice, they are distributed by the garden-channel of the lords\\(^2\\) of liberality.\n\nVerse,\n\nFor ever, and so long as there are stars in the firmament,\nFor ever, and so long as there are bodies with souls,\nMay there be no revolution of the spheres without thy pleasure,\nNo movement of the heavenly bodies except according to thy will.\n\nhave been a bad omen. I do not understand how the Moon is said to be in \\textit{fara\u1e25}, i.e., joy; but apparently the author draws from this the inference that the enemies will be distressed and the Native will be gladdened. Possibly it refers to the Moon's being in the Fifth House and so in trine to the Ascendant. Perhaps the word is a mistake for \\textit{farg\u0101}, emptiness or disengagement.\n\n\\(^1\\) The Dragon's Tail is a cause of misfortune and increases evil influences. Apparently \\textit{awwal} 'first,' must be a mistake for \\textit{\u0101khir}, 'last,' for the Dragon's Tail is in the last degree of the Twelfth House vis., 27\u00b0 29' 13\" Leo.

A crowd\\(^1\\) of ancient philosophers, including Aristotle, were agreed that the Eighth\\(^2\\) Heaven had no motion. The philosopher Hipparchus contended that it did move, but he did not ascertain the rate of progression. Ptolemy said the motion was one degree in a century and that the revolution was completed in 36,000 years. Most philosophers hold that the rate is one degree in seventy years and that the revolution is completed in 25,200 years. Another school say that a degree is traversed in sixty-three\\(^3\\) years and that the revolution is completed in 22,680 years. The cause of such\n\n---\n\n1 This passage is substantially repeated in the Ain (III, 11; Jarrett III, 20.)\n\n2 This is the Heaven of the Fixed Stars. In the Ain (III, 34; Jarrett III, 38) this is numbered as the Second Heaven,\u2014the Eighth being that of Mercury. Here the author counts them in reverse order, beginning with the lowest, vis., that of the Moon,\u2014and by thus counting upwards, the Heaven of the Fixed Stars becomes the Eighth. It will be remembered that the ancients attributed motion to the Fixed Stars, or at least to the sphere in which they were supposed to be placed. \"The Ptolemaic astronomy attributes motion and a regular course to those stars which we now call Fixed but which the Greeks merely called \u1f00\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 undeviating.\" (Ashmanden.)\n\n3 I do not know what school is referred to here. In the Ain (II, 11 1.7 fr. foot) Ibn A' (A'lam) (cir. 985 A.D.) and Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn T\u016bs\u012b (cir. 1272 A.D.) are mentioned as holding that the rate is one degree in sixty solar years. Perhaps the sixty-three are lunar but these are equal to more than 60 solar years,\u2014for at the rate of eleven days a year, we get only 660 days or not quite two years. According to S\u00e9dillot (Notes et \u00c9claircissements. Prolegomena. 289)\ndiscrepancies is a difference in the equipment and instruments of the observatories and difference in the profundity and subtlety of the observations.\n\nThe fact is, the earliest philosophers did not suspect the motion of the Fixed Stars, on account of its exceeding slowness. For this reason, they did not get sufficient time to observe it.\n\nAt the time when the Signs of the Zodiac were determined, the figure Leo which was regarded as a constellation of several fixed stars, was opposite to and in front of a (certain) part of the Heaven of Heavens, and now, owing to the movement of the Zodiacal Heaven, it has moved from that part and is in the station where\n\nNa\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn as well as Ulugh Beg held seventy years to be the time. But he refers to his Mat\u00e9riaux (481) as showing that Arzachil knew of a movement as correct as that of our modern Tables. Arago, in his lectures, says that the movement is $50''-103$ a year, and that the revolution is completed in 25,867 years.\n\nIn the Astronomia quaedam ex traditione Sh\u0101h Cholg\u012bl published by Greaves (Gravius) about the middle of the 17th century, we are told that according to observations made in the time of the Khalif Al-M\u0101m\u016bn (813\u201334 A.D.) a degree was passed in 66 years and 8 months. Perhaps these were lunar, and if so, they would correspond nearly to the 63 (solar) mentioned in the Text. Muhammad Sh\u0101h Qulj\u012b wrote a commentary on the Tables of Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn T\u016bs\u012b in 866 (1461). A. F. perhaps copied from him, for the passage in the beginning of the \u0100yn (Jarrett 6) about the explanation of the term s\u012bj, etc., is very similar to one on Muhammad Sh\u0101h Qulj\u012b, as given by Greaves and also it appears, by S\u00e9dillot. But Oriental writers copy so much from one another that it is difficult to know who was the original source. Sh\u0101h Qulj\u012b also gives seventy years as the rate of precession according to the Mar\u0101gha Tables; and says that the annual rate was $51''-26''$.\n\n1 The text reads \u1e6d\u0101\u02be, time, but MS. 564 has \u1e6d\u0101\u02be which I have adopted.\n\n2 I suppose the meaning is that the motion being less than a minute a year, it could not become perceptible unless after a lifetime of observations or unless the observations were continued for generations.\n\n3 i.e., the Ninth or Crystalline Heaven.\n\n4 The Penny Cyclopaedia (Art. Astrology) says: \u201cThe astrologers never made any allowance for the precession of the equinoxes. Thus though the constellation Aries is now in Taurus and the influences of its stars ought to have moved with them, we find that the astronomical Aries or first $30^\\circ$ of the ecliptic, is used for the constellation. Under the circumstances, this is of little consequence, but such a practice would be fatal to astronomy.\u201d\nVirgo then was. Similarly Virgo has moved to the station of Libra, Libra to Scorpio and so on, up to the last Sign. Now the calculation of Indian astrologers\\(^1\\) is in accord with the observations of the ancient philosophers which were based on the notion that the Fixed Stars did not move. The calculation of the new observations\\(^2\\) is founded on the movement of the Zodiacal Heaven which has caused the constellation Leo to move to the House\n\nAshmand (Preface and p. 32) defends astrologers against this charge and says, \"We should rather say that the stars have changed places than that the parts of heaven in which they once were situated have done so.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) The author does not mean that the Indian astronomers were ignorant of the movement of the stars, i.e., of the precession of the equinoxes. The account in the \u0100in (Jarrett III. 19) shows that they held the movement to be \\(54''\\) a year. But they thought that the (westward) movement only extended to \\(27^\\circ\\) Aries and that then the stars retrograded to \\(27^\\circ\\) Pisces and afterwards recommenced. In other words they held that the stars librated between \\(27^\\circ\\) Aries and \\(27^\\circ\\) Pisces.\n\n\\(^2\\) By the \"new observations\" those of Ulugh Beg are commonly meant, and it must be those which are referred to here, for A. F. is dealing with the horoscope of Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd which, we are told, was founded on the Gurg\u0101nt Tables, i.e., those of Ulugh Beg. According to B\u0101bar (Erskine 51) the tables used by the Indian astronomers were those of Vikram\u0101ditya and he says that 1584 years had elapsed from the building of Vikram\u0101ditya's observatory. Apparently B\u0101bar was writing this in 1527-28, = 1584 Vikram\u0101ditya Era (which began B.C. 57.) But his statement in no way coincides with A. F.'s for Ulugh Beg's Tables were drawn up in 1434 and published in 1437 and if we deduct 1190 from 1434, we get 244 A.D. as the date of the Indian Tables.\n\n(S\u00e9dillot gives the epoch of Ulugh Beg's Tables as 841 H. = 1437 A.D.)\n\nNor can we reconcile the statements by supposing that the \"new observations\" mean those of Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn \u1e6c\u0101s\u012b which were made at Mar\u0101gha in the latter part of the 13th century. According to the \u0100in (Jarrett 4) Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn's observatory was built 362 years and Ulugh Beg's 156 before A. F. wrote his book. Now the \u0100in was composed in the 40th year of Akbar, i.e., 1596, so that 1234 would be the date of the Mar\u0101gha observations and 1434 those of Samarqand (Ulugh Beg's). The date 1234 is, however, certainly wrong, as it is nearly a quarter of a century before the destruction of Baghd\u0101d (1258) and we know that it was after this that Hul\u0101g\u016b Kh\u0101n installed Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn at Mar\u0101gha. According to D'Herbelot, Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn was established at Mar\u0101gha in 657 (1259) and published his Tables in 668 (1270). Perhaps \u06af\u0634\u0644\u060c sixty, is a\nof Virgo. The difference between the two calculations is $17^\\circ$, each Sign having moved $17^\\circ$ from its place. From this it may be known that 1190 years have elapsed from the observations of the Indian philosophers to the new ones, assuming that a degree is traversed every seventy years, and most philosophers are agreed that we should multiply 17 by 70. On the view of Ptolemy that the movement is one degree a century, the interval between the two sets of observations is 1700 years.\n\nKeen-sighted inquirers after truth and subtle perceivers of the secrets of the skies fell into the valley of perturbation on account of these discrepancies. Now that the pattern of the philosophers of the Age, \u2018Azdu-l-daulah Amir Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h of Shiraz, has shewn by the Greek Canon and the Persian rules that his Majesty\u2019s auspicious horoscope is in Leo as has been stated above, it clearly appears that the explanation of the disagreement is not, as was commonly supposed, that the Indian philosophers deny the existence of the spheres, as has been set forth in the Second Volume. Rather it was the Divine wisdom (hikmat-i-il\u0101hi) and the Divine jealousy which demanded that the description of this cavalier of the plain of majesty\n\ncopyist\u2019s error for \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u062a b\u012bst, twenty which would yield the date 1274. A. F., however, with all his industry, is not to be trusted about dates as Silvestre de Sacy has shewn with reference to a statement in the \u0100y\u0101r-i-D\u0101nish about the poet R\u016bdagi. Even if we deduct the 1190 years from 1272, the date of the Mar\u0101gha observations, we do not get back to Vikram\u0101diya\u2019s era, though we get very near that of \u015a\u0101lihv\u0101hana, viz., 78 A.D.\n\nThe most probable explanation is that B\u0101bar was mistaken in supposing that the Vikram\u0101diya of the Tables was the Vikram\u0101diya of the Era. The Indian Tables were probably composed in the time of the second Vikram\u0101diya and in that of Var\u0101ha Mihira, though this date is also inconsistent with A. F.\u2019s calculation.\n\n1 It would seem (Text III. 440 l.5 fr. foot) that the exact difference was a little more than $17^\\circ$, for we are told that B\u0101n\u016b \u0100r\u0101m, Akbar\u2019s daughter, was born under $10^\\circ$ Sagittarius or $1^\\circ 54'$ according to Hind\u0101 calculation.\n\n2 The Lucknow ed. has \u201clast volume,\u201d and this is probably correct, the reference apparently being to the concluding volume of the \u0100in, viz., III. 8. (Jarrett III. 13.)\n\n3 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633 f\u0101ris. It also means a lion and so there may be an allusion to the constellation Leo. Akbar is called (\u0100in I. 139) sh\u0101hsuv\u0101r-i-ar\u1e63a-i-iy\u0101l, \u2018the royal rider of the plain of fortune.\u2019\nand confidant of the sublime cabinet, should remain hidden from the gaze of keen-sighted, penetrating, minute inquirers, as well as from the eyes of the evil-disposed and inwardly blind.\n\nIt was from this cause, that his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b, who in astrolabic investigations and studies of astronomical Tables and observations, was at the head of the enthroned ones of acute knowledge and was a second Alexander,\u2014in spite of his perfect labours and exertions in the matter of the horoscope of the Lord of the Age, did not attain to the truth (did not reveal the whole truth). And likewise all those others who were versed in the secrets of astrology, remained within the curtain of contradiction and did not arrive at a perfect knowledge of the mystery. And notwithstanding the identity of the canons of calculation and the inquiries of right-thinkers,\u2014for natural philosophers do not materially disagree in these matters,\u2014owing to the jealousy of God, the truth of the holy nativity remained under the veil of concealment and was hidden behind the curtain of contradiction. But on the whole, if each of the horoscopes be looked at with the eye of judgment\u2014and a sketch of each has been given,\u2014it becomes plain that in the matter of power, dignity and sublimity, external and internal, there is nothing equal to them. Though the horoscopes are discrepant, they agree in external and internal splendour and congratulate the Native as supreme over the visible and invisible worlds. And those intimate friends of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b, whose outward and inward beings were clothed with truth and righteousness, have been heard to tell that when his Majesty had the auspicious horoscope shewn to him and had considered it, it happened several times that when in his private chamber and with the doors all closed, he fell a\u2019dancing, and from excess of exultation, revolved with a circular motion. Why indeed should not sitters in the front ranks of the pavilion of true glory, and tasters of the trays of eternal knowledge\u2014who have partaken of the sweets of ecstasy and the knowledge of God, indulge in transports of joy at the sweets of this revelation, and why should they not chant strains of rapture? For these perfections are steps or\n\n1 The author seems to refer to the fact of eminent astrologers, having been princes, e.g., Alexander, Alphonso of Castile and Ulugh Beg.\nstages of exaltation and are the essence of Divine knowledge. And his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101ghiy\u0101n\u012b was by the perfection of his personality, enlightened by flashes of forthcoming events and glimpses into the future, and his senses were warmed by the auspicious advent of his Majesty, the King of Kings. And all these lights were seen, before realization in the ranks of actions, in the mirror of the wondrous horoscope. And he many times said to those who were privileged to converse with him, that the horoscope of this Light of Fortune was superior, in several respects and by sundry degrees, to that of his Majesty, the Lord of Conjunction\u00b9 (Tim\u016br) as indeed clearly appears to the scrutinizing students of the prognostications. And when these two auspicious documents are compared, and the gifts of the planets and the blessings of the heavens\u00b2 are weighed in the balance of reflection, it will be seen what are the communications of the horoscope of the Lord of Conjunction, and what are those of the holy horoscope. Praise be to God! notwithstanding the remoteness of the horoscopists in time, place and condition, and the discrepancy of their canons, every one of the glorious schemes agrees\u2014as has been shewn\u2014in this, that the Native will attain lofty, spiritual and temporal rank, and that his holy personality will be a collection of inward and outward excellencies and will be possessed of various perfections and will have sway over the visible and invisible world. He will have various kinds of sovereignties and various degrees of rule, and will attain lofty rank in worship of the Truth and in theology. He will befriend the poor and humble, and will have long life and soundness of body and an equable disposition and will be praised by high and low and thanked by great and small. He will have perfect knowledge of the world, and will rule countries and guard the paths of righteousness,\n\n\u00b9 The horoscope of Tim\u016br is given in the Zafarn\u0101ma but without much detail. There is also one, as noticed by Gibbon, in Hyde's Syntagma (Dissert: II. 468) which was cast by Ashmole.\n\n\u00b2 alw\u012by\u0101t. Perhaps this word has a technical meaning here, e.g., the superior planets, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, which were so-called because their orbits were supposed to be higher than that of the Sun. See Maf\u0101t\u012b\u1e25u-l-\u02bful\u016bm, 229, top line. Mercury and Venus and the Moon are called kaw\u0101kabu-s-sif\u1e6diya, inferior planets.\nand will perform the duties of government and of the administration of the world.\n\nIt is a remarkable circumstance that all those qualities which astrologers have come to know by toil and meditation, are read by simple-minded persons who know nothing of the diagrams of stellar mysteries, by dint of their own insight, on the forehead-page\\(^1\\) of his Majesty's career, though they have humbly to acknowledge the inability of language to expound them.\n\nVerse.\n\nThy attributes have made tongues incoherent,\nThy glorious personality has changed certainty into conjecture.\n\nNOTE ON THE HOROSCOPES OF AKBAR.\n\nAbu-l-fa\u1e63l gives four horoscopes. The first and fourth however appear to be substantially the same. Both were made by Mu\u1e25ammadan servants of Hum\u0101y\u016bn,\u2014the first by Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd and the fourth by Maul\u0101n\u0101 Aly\u0101s of Ardabil. Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd's was drawn up according to the \"New Tables,\" i.e., those of Ulugh Beg M\u012brz\u0101 who was T\u012bm\u016br's grandson. These were calculated for 1437. Maul\u0101n\u0101 Ily\u0101s' horoscope was cast according to the \u012akh\u0101n\u012b or Imperial Tables, i.e., those made by Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b at Mar\u0101gha\u2014about 50 miles\\(^2\\) S. by W. of T\u0101br\u012bz\u2014in the reign of Hul\u0101g\u016b Kh\u0101n cir. 1272.\n\nAbu-l-fa\u1e63l, writing in the 40th year of Akbar, (1596) says (Jarrett II, 4.) that 362 years had elapsed since Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn built his observatory and 156 since Ulugh Beg built his at Samarqand. This gives a date of 1440 for Ulugh Beg's Tables and of 1234 for Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn's, but the latter is certainly wrong, and probably there is some clerical error in the text. If Hul\u0101g\u016b Kh\u0101n first established him in Mar\u0101gha, it is assuredly wrong, but A. F. evidently thinks he was there earlier. (\u0100\u02be\u012bn II, 11.)\n\nThe second horoscope was made by Jotik Rai, Akbar's astrologer. We do not know its exact date but it was, of course, drawn many years after Akbar's birth and after the construction, by Hum\u0101y\u016bn's orders, of the first and fourth horoscopes.\n\nThe third was made by Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h of Sh\u012br\u0101z and could not have been drawn earlier than 991 (1583), for this astronomer did not come to Akbar's Court till that year. Indeed A. F. tells us that it was in the first year of Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h's service that he asked him to compare the horoscopes and reconcile their discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The meaning is, that the actual facts of Akbar's life exhibit all those wonderful qualities which astrologers have found by painful investigation of his horoscope.\nBoth Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd and Maul\u0101n\u0101 Aly\u0101s put the birth under Virgo and there is no doubt this is correct,\u2014if correctness can be predicated of such matters. The Indian astrologers probably put the birth in Leo because that Sign is the House of the Sun, between whom and Akbar there was supposed to be a mysterious connection. Possibly however, the earlier date of their Tables warranted them in putting the birth under Leo, as A. F. has explained in his chapter on the discrepancies. But granting that this was so, we are not told why their Tables should be preferred to those of Na\u1e63\u012br\u016b-d-d\u012bn and Ulugh Beg. And indeed Abu-l-fa\u017cl does not prefer them. He tells us that Indian Tables agree with the observations of those philosophers who are not aware that there was a movement of the Fixed Stars. In other words, he admits that they are wrong.\n\nIf the precession of the equinoxes account for the difference between the Tables, why stop short at the Hind\u016b observations? A. F. calculates that these were made 1190 years before Ulugh Beg's, i.e., about 1336 before Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h cast Akbar's horoscope. According to B\u0101bar (Erskine 51.) the Hind\u016b Tables were made at Ujjain in the time of Vikram\u0101ditya, i.e., cir. 57 B.C. According to Tod, (R\u0101jp\u016bt\u0101n\u0101) Hind\u016b astronomers now follow the Tables of Jai Singh which were made in 1728. (See Dr. Hunter's paper, Asiatic Researches V, 177.) But why did not he or Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h carry the calculation further back and ascertain the position of the constellations of the Zodiac at the time, say, of the birth of Adam or at least, of Enoch or Idris who, according to Mu\u1e25ammadans, is the father of astronomy? Some astrologers professed to know the position of the stars at the time of the Creation and held that Adam was born under 1\u00b0 Capricorn (See infra for A. F.'s account of Adam). And at all events A. F., who seems to have accepted the chronology according to which Adam was born about 7000 before his own time, could have had no difficulty in calculating the position of the constellations at that period, allowing one degree for every seventy years.\n\nAccording to A. F. the difference between the Indian astrologers and Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd amounts to 17\u00b0. But apparently Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h did not adopt the Indian calculations, which indeed he probably could not read. (He was a Persian and we are told in the \u0100\u02bein (Blochmann 104) that he superintended the translation of part of Ulugh Beg's Tables, though, if as has been supposed, these were originally written in Persian, one does not see what necessity there was for translating them. There is however a doubt on the point and A. F.'s remark implies that Ulugh Beg's Tables were written in a foreign language, e.g., Arabic or Turkish. According to D'Herbelot, they were first written in Arabic but S\u00e9dillot has no doubt that Persian was their original language). Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h, we are told, based his calculations on the Greek and Persian Tables, not on the Indian, and found the cusp of the Ascendant to be 28\u00b0 36' Leo.\n\nLeo is the Sign immediately preceding Virgo, and if the difference of the Hind\u016b and Persian calculations be 17\u00b0, the cusp according to the former, should apparently be 20\u00b0 Leo, for Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd's horoscope brought out\nthe cusp of the Ascendant as 7\u00b0 Virgo. We are not told what Tables Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h used and are left in the dark as to his modus operandi. The difference between his calculations and those of Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd was apparently, about 8\u00bd\u00b0 vis., from 28\u00b0 36\u2032 Leo to 7\u00b0 Virgo. If, as A. F. does, we take the rate of precession to be one degree in 70 years, Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h must have used Tables made about 600 years before Ulugh Beg's. This would give a date of about 830 A.D., which approximates to the Baghd\u0101d observations of the Khal\u012bf M\u0101m\u016bn referred to in the \u0100\u02bein (Jarrett II. 3.)\n\nIf we take the more correct rate of precession, vis., one degree in 72 years, we get a still closer approximation for 8\u00bd\u00b0 = 612 years and this, deducted from 1434 = 822 A.D.\n\nI regret that I have not been able to translate the four horoscope chapters in a satisfactory manner. They are difficult, for several words of frequent use in them, are not to be found in our dictionaries, at least not with their astronomical meaning. Dozy's Supplement is of little or no use for astrological terms, and Lane appears to ignore them altogether. Unfortunately with all his amplitude of detail, A. F. fails us at the very pinch of the case. That is, he gives no explanation of Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h's modus operandi and does not tell us how he managed to bring the horoscope into Leo.\n\nIt is probable that in places, the text is corrupt.\n\nBooks on astrology are very numerous. One of the best of the old treatises is De Judicis Astrorum by \u2018Al\u012b Abu-l-hasan (Albohazan Haly Aben Rajal). He, it appears, was born in Spain, for he is styled Ash-Shaib\u0101n\u012b and Ash-Shab\u012bl\u012b (Hispaniensis) and his full name is Abu-l-hasan \u2018Al\u012b Ibn Abi-r-raj\u0101lu-sh-shaib\u0101n\u012b.\n\nIn Hammer-Purgstall's History of Arabian Literature, (6436) he is styled \u2018Al\u012b Ibn Raj\u0101l and we are told that Europeans called him Ab\u00e9n-Ragel and that he was born at Cordova and lived in the beginning of the 5th century of the Hijra.\n\nHis work on astrology, \u201cOpus magnum de astrologia, octo partibus comprehensum,\u201d was first translated from Arabic into Spanish by order of Alphonso, the king of Castile, and afterwards from Spanish into Latin. He appears also to have been a poet, for a poem of his on astrology is mentioned in Casiri's catalogue of the Escurial Library I, 128 and 344. The best edition of Haly's work appears to be that by Anthony Stupa, Basle, 1551. There is a copy of this in the British Museum and bound up with it, is an elaborate treatise on astrology by Guido Bonatus and also a commentary on the Tetrabiblos.\n\nGuido Bonatus, also called Guido Bonatti and Bonati, was a noted astrologer of the 13th century. He was a native of Florence, but is commonly called Foroliviensis or De Foro Livii, the modern Forli, a town on the eastern side of the Appenines and not far from Ravenna. He is said by his astrological skill to have saved Forli from a siege. Eventually he became a monk and died in 1296.\n\nLilly quotes Abu-l-hasan under the name of Haly and Sir Walter Scott makes Guy Mannering refer both to him and to Guido Bonatus. D\u00e9ambre\nsays, in his History of astronomy in the Middle Ages, that Abu-l-Hasan's book \"est l'un des plus clairs, des plus m\u00e9thodiques, and des plus compl\u00e8tes que nous ayons. C'est une compilation de tout ce que les sages de diff\u00e9rents pays et de diff\u00e9rents si\u00e8cles avaient \u00e9crit sur ce sujet futile.\" It appears that Haly was a Christian. There is a MS. copy of his work in the British Museum written in beautifully clear Arabic characters. It is numbered 23,399. See Codices Arabici 623b. It is to be hoped that some day an Arabic scholar will print and edit it.\n\nLilly's Christian Astrology and the works of Zadkiel are useful and so also are Wilson's Dictionary of Astrology (London, 1819), and a work by E. Sibley in two quarto volumes and published in 1817. For Hind\u016b astrology, I can recommend two Bengali books kindly sent me by Dr. Grierson, viz., the Jy\u014dti\u1e63a Prak\u0101ya (Beni Madhab De & Co., Calcutta, 1882, Sak. 1804) and the Var\u0101ha Mihira of Kali Prosanna Chattarji (1891, Fasli 1300). I have also found the notes of Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e62\u0101diq 'Al\u012b the Lucknow editor of the Akbarn\u0101ma very useful and I have obtained some light from the two elaborate horoscopes of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n,\u2014one of his birth and the other of his accession,\u2014which are given in 'Abdu-l-ham\u012bd's B\u0101deh\u0101hn\u0101ma.\n\nMr. Rehatek's Catalogue of the Mull\u0101 Fir\u016bz Library in Bombay shews that it is very rich in Persian works on astrology.\n\nTo the useful books on Astrology may be added the treatise of Julius Firmicus Maternus, a Latin writer of the 4th century A.D. A good and cheap edition of this work is in course of publication at Leipsic under the editorship of Charles Sittl. Firmicus describes the Dodecalemoria, p. 48, the Decani, p. 41, and has a chapter, p. 233, on empty and full degrees, the full being degrees where the Decani are found, and the empty where their influence does not operate.\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE HONOURED NAMES OF THE BLISSFUL NURSES AND SPIRITUALLY-MOULDED CHERISHERS\u00b9 (qaw\u0101bil-i-r\u016b\u1e25\u0101n\u012b-qaw\u0101lib) OF HIS MAJESTY, THE KING OF KINGS.\n\nWhen the lightsome day of his creation arrived, at once was Heaven envious of Earth for his passing;\u00b2 and Earth exultant o'er Heaven for his august advent. The status of knowledge and insight became exalted, and with rites which are the glory of the ministers of outward show, was that holy essence and pure pearl\u2014already washed and cleansed at the fountain-head of Divine Light and in the ocean of infinite knowledge (ma'rifat)\u2014bathed and composed by the hands of shade-loving, radiance-darting, chaste, rose-bodied nymphs. Even-tempered, spiritually-minded nurses swathed the divine form and heavenly body in auspicious swaddling-bands, purer than angelic veils, and laid him with respect and reverence in the sacred arms and bosoms of pure-dispositioned ones. And then his honied\u00b3 lips being brought in contact with the benign breasts, his mouth was sweetened by the life-giving fluid.\n\n\u00b9 \u0642\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0644 pl. of \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0629. The word seems properly to mean a midwife, but, as it comes after d\u012bya and as no midwife is mentioned by name\u2014unless D\u012bya Bh\u0101wal be one,\u2014I have rendered it cherisher. The word \u062f\u06cc\u0627 means both a midwife and a wet-nurse.\n\n\u00b2 Farr-i-wil\u0101dat. There is a play here on the two meanings of farr. Farr in Arabic means flight, and is here used in the sense of departure or passing, being contrasted with magdam, advent or coming. The birth or vital principle of Akbar left Heaven and came upon Earth, thereby making Heaven envious and Earth leap for pride. But farr or fur means in Persian, light or splendour, being etymologically the same word as the Greek \u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2 and the English fire and so, farr-i-wil\u0101dat also means the light or splendour of the birth. Farr is often used by A. F. to mean the sacred light which belongs to a king. Thus at the beginning of the \u0100in, he speaks of kingship as a light emanating from God, which light modern language calls the farr-i-iz\u0101d\u012b or Divine light and which in ancient times was called the sublime halo. (Kiy\u0101n-Khura.) (Blochmann iii.)\n\n\u00b3 The word in the Text is not honied but only sweet. However there is perhaps an allusion to the\nVerse.\n\nHe drew forth milk by the bounty of his lips,\nMilk and sugar were commingled.\nIt was not milk he drank from the breast of hope,\n'Twas water from the Sun's fountain that he imbibed.\n\nAs the nobly-born Shamsu-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad of Ghazn\u012b had done a good service at Kanauj,\u00b9 his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b, shortly before the rising of this light of fortune, (Akbar) in magnificent recompense of his deed, made him hopeful of eternal bliss by promising him the majestic boon, that his high-souled, chaste-natured consort\u2014who has now the lofty title of Ji\u1e63\u1e63\u0101 Anaga\u2014should be clothed with the glorious head-dress (mi\u02bfjar) and mantle of distinction, by obtaining the auspicious service of nursing this new fruit of the spring-tide of sovereignty and fortune, and should have the blissful charge\u00b2 of the nosegay of the house-garden of greatness and glory.\n\nAccordingly her Majesty, Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b, Qadas\u012b-ark\u0101n\u012b (Pillar of Purity) having sent for that adorer of Heaven's table (i.e., celestial caterer) placed in an auspicious moment, the child-treasure in her hopeful bosom. But as the period of pregnancy\u00b3 of this purely-framed nurse was not yet fulfilled, her Majesty ordered that receptacle of chastity, D\u0101ya Bh\u0101wal\u2014a special servant of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, and distinguished for virtue and purity\u2014to suckle the infant. It appears that first of all, he accepted the milk of his royal mother. Then Fakhr-i-nis\u0101,\u2074 wife of Nadim Koka was honoured by the charge, then Bh\u0101wal Anaga, then the wife of Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi,\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Spelled here Qanauj. Shamsu-d-din helped Hum\u0101y\u016bn up the steep bank of the Ganges, after he had swum across on an elephant when defeated by Sh\u0101h Sh\u0101h. (Blochmann 321.)\n\n\u00b2 According to Meninski (1698) Ji\u1e63\u1e63\u0101, in Turkish, means a child's plaything. It also, in Turkish, means handsome.\n\n\u00b3 \u062d\u0641\u0627\u0636\u0629 hif\u1e93\u0101nat, the technical word for the charge of a child. (Baillie's Mu. Law, 429.)\n\n\u2074 The child to whom she afterwards gave birth was \u2018Az\u012bz Koka, the later Kh\u0101n A\u02bfgam. He was thus only slightly younger than Akbar who used to say that a channel of milk connected them together. (Mu\u02bf\u0101\u1e93ir I. 675). Ji\u1e63\u1e63\u0101 is said to have died in 1008 (1599). See l.c. 685 where she is called B\u012bca Ji\u016b.\n\n\u2075 Gulbadan (26) speaks of Fakhr-i-nis\u0101 Anaga as the mother of Nad\u012bm Koka and wife of M\u012brz\u0101 Quli.\n\n\u2076 There is an account of him in Text (I. 222) and he is mentioned in B\u0101yaz\u012bd Sul\u1e6d\u0101n's list of the officers\nthen Hak\u012bma. After these, the chaste J\u012bj\u012b Anaga, in accordance with her wish, obtained external and internal felicity. After her, Kok\u012b Anaga, wife of T\u014dgh Beg\u012b\u00b9 and after her, Bib\u012b R\u016bp\u0101\u00b2 had their turn of this auspicious service. Then Kh\u0101ld\u0101r (i.e., the molemarked) Anaga, mother of Sa\u02bf\u0101dat Y\u0101r Koka,\u00b3 was selected for this great boon. And at last, that chaste matron, Pija J\u0101n Anaga,\u2074 mother of Zain Kh\u0101n Koka, acquired a stock of everlasting greatness by obtaining her wish for this great blessing. Many other fortunate cupolas of chastity were exalted by the excellence of this service. It was as if there were Divine wisdom in thus implanting varied temperaments\u2075 by this series of developments (i.e., the wet-nurses) so that the pure entity,\u2076 advancing by gradations, might become familiar with the divers methods of Divine manifestation. Or it\n\nwho came to India with Hum\u0101y\u016bn. A. F. calls him Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi Tabr\u012bz\u012b and says that he was distinguished for his knowledge of accounts and made a d\u012bw\u0101n by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and was subsequently, for a long time, excluded from Court and only returned at the end of his life to the Court of Akbar and when his intellect was enfeebled by age. B\u0101yz\u0101d calls him Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi Shir\u0101z\u012b and says Hum\u0101y\u016bn made him a d\u012bw\u0101n when he was in the Takht-i-sulaim\u0101n country. The fact of his long exclusion from Court and of his not being entered in the Grandees of the \u0100\u02bein or of the Tabaq\u0101t, might explain, supposing him M\u0101ham Anaga\u2019s husband, (see note at end of chapter) why no mention is made of him in that relation.\n\n\u00b9 Mentioned in B\u0101yz\u0101d\u2019s Catalogue as Toq Beg\u012b S\u0101qi, i.e., page or cupbearer.\n\n\u00b2 Apparently a Hind\u016bst\u0101n\u012b and possibly a Hind\u016b.\n\n\u00b3 Sa\u02bf\u0101dat Y\u0101r Koka is mentioned three times in the Akbarn\u0101ma, in the third volume, viz.: (192) where he is one of those sent on pilgrimage to Mecca; (579) where we are told, his brother\u2019s daughter was given in marriage by the Emperor to A. F.\u2019s son \u2018Abdu-r-rahm\u0101n (see Blochmann, Life of A. F. XXXV.) and lastly (656) where we are told of Sa\u02bf\u0101dat Y\u0101r\u2019s death in the 39th year (\u0100zar 1003, November 1595), from excessive drinking and of the Emperor\u2019s sorrow for this and of his paying a visit of consolation to the house of his sister, H\u0101j\u012b Koka.\n\n\u2074 Called by the Ma\u02bf\u0101zir and Blochmann, Picah J\u0101n Anaga. She was the wife of Khw\u0101ja Maq\u1e63\u016bd of Her\u0101t.\n\n\u2075 Mo\u1e25\u0101rib, dispositions, but also beverages, and tabaqa\u1e6d, dishes or trays as well as stages or degrees, so that apparently one of the intended meanings is \u201cdivers beverages in divers vessels,\u201d signifying the varied nature of the nurses\u2019 milk.\n\n\u2076 The text has wuj\u016bd, unity, but I presume this is a mistake for wuj\u016bd, which occurs in No. 564.\nmight be designed that the acute and discerning should perceive that this nursling of fortune belonged to the limpid streams of Divine bounty and was not such as to make spiritual progress by outward nutriment, for as to the spiritual nature of this company (of nurses), it is evident to all of what kind that was, as also are the lofty degrees of the holy stages of this chosen one.\n\nAmong other wondrous indications there was this, that contrary to the way of other infants, his Majesty, the king of kings, at his birth and at the first opening of his eyes on the visible world, rejoiced the hearts of the wise by a sweet smile. Penetrating physiognomists recognized the smile as the herald-augury of the smiles of the spring of dominion and fortune and saw in it, the opening bud of hope and peace.\n\nAfter that (i.e., the suckling), in a cradle lighter than a phantom (which the carpenters of the throne of sovereignty had framed of sandal-wood and lign-aloes, and where they had, as it were, commingled civet and rose-leaves, and on whose corners and sides they had hung rubies and pearls of price) was laid with gentlest movement that unique Pearl of nine mothers o\u2019pearl, and then they softly swayed and rocked him. For cheer and soothing, they chaunted with musical rhythm the name\u2014auspicious to begin with and fitting as a close\u2014of the Creator, the Lord of Glory and Bounty. The inmates of holy hermitages and those who live in the throng of\n\n---\n\n1 This seems rather ungracious, especially after such complimentary expressions about them.\n\n2 This is a trait mentioned of Zoroaster. (See Dab\u012bst\u0101n trans: I. 218). Only he is said to have laughed aloud when he was born. Anquetil du Perron (Life of Zoroaster 13n.) quotes Pliny who, in his Natural History, says, \u201cRisisse eodem die quo genitus esset, numm hominem accepimus Zoroastrum.\u201d The account of Solomon in the Apocrypha is more touching. \u201cWhen I was born, I drew in the common air and fell upon the earth which is of like nature, and the first voice which I uttered, was crying, as all others do.\u201d\n\n3 The Lucknow ed. says that this means the Nine Heavens. Sadaf means the oyster-shell and also the vault of heaven. It is also a name given apparently to the two constellations of Ursa Major and Minor. See Burh\u0101n-i-q\u0101t\u012b.\n\n4 \u0121\u012bl Sh\u0101h, also called sab\u0101d, whence civet. (Blochmann 79.)\n\n5 \u2018\u0101k\u012bf\u0101n-i-gaw\u0101mi\u2019. This phrase occurs in one of Faiz\u2019s odes (\u0100in I. 240) and is translated by Blochmann (559) \u201cthose who constantly worship\nmen who are the stewards of time and the terrene and hold together the spheres of the universe, attained their desires and thus were benefits bestowed on the world and on mankind. They sang this gratulatory strain to the darling\\(^1\\) of the skies.\n\n**Verse.**\n\nHail to thee to whom is committed reason\u2019s exaltation.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe kingly revolution of the universe is for thee.\n\nLike thee, the earth has no garden;\n\nLike thee, heaven\u2019s vault no lamp.\n\nCreative ocean rolled many a wave\n\nTill it cast ashore a pearl like thee.\n\nFate\u2019s pencil drew many a sketch\n\nTill she made a portrait like thee.\n\nThe world\u2019s book is but an allusion\\(^3\\) to thee,\n\nHeaven\u2019s volume but an analysis\\(^4\\) of thee.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Jigargosha lit: liver-lobe.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sharaf, an astrological term signifying the exaltation of a planet or star.

This is from sharh and seems primarily to mean dissection. (Dict.: of T. Ts. 735.)\nM\u0100HAM ANAGA.\n\nIt is singular that this name does not occur in the list of Akbar's nurses. This may be due to M\u0101ham Anaga's being a title and not a proper name, and it is possible that the lady who was afterwards thus designated, is mentioned in the list under some other appellation. She may, for instance, be the nurse described as the wife of Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi and whose own name is not given. But even if the title were not bestowed till a later period, one would have expected A. F. to have added it to his description, just as he mentions Shamsu-d-d\u012bn's wife by her title of J\u012bj\u012b Anaga. The true explanation of the omission probably is that M\u0101ham Anaga means Head or Superintendent of the nurses rather than chief nurse and that the M\u0101ham Anaga of the Akbarn\u0101ma was not a wet-nurse. She certainly was not the chief nurse in the sense that the child Akbar drew most of his nourishment from her, for we are told that J\u012bj\u012b Anaga was chief in this respect, so much so that the other nurses accused her of practising witchcraft in order to prevent the infant prince from accepting any breast but her own.\n\nThough Anaga seems primarily to mean a wet-nurse, it has not always this meaning. Pavet de Courteille says (Turkish Dictionary, 57) \"\u011fl\u0131 et \u011fl\u0131, nourrice, sage-femme, gouvernante; on donne aussi \u00e0 la m\u00e8re du Kh\u0101n le titre de \u011fl\u0131 \u011fl\u0131.\" We find also that the mother of Cing\u012bz Kh\u0101n had this title, her name being given in the Akbarn\u0101ma (I. 72, top line) as \"Olun Anaga\" though Erdmann spells it Eke. Apparently the Turkish pronunciation is Enge. See Redhouse s. v. He states that it means a sister-in-law, the wife of an elder brother or lady-relative of a bridegroom who is sent to fetch the bride home. A. F. sometimes calls M\u0101ham Anaga, M\u0101ham Bega and M\u0101ham \u0100gha, and it is generally by the title of Bega that B\u0101yaz\u012bd Sul\u1e6d\u0101n speaks of her in the so-called T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hum\u0101y\u016bn. (I. O. Ms. No. 216). He calls her (15) M\u0101ham Bega and adds the explanation ke \u0101gha anaga Naw\u0101b-i-\u012bsh\u0101n b\u016bd, i.e., who was head of the Prince's nurses. And then follows the statement that she was accompanied by J\u012bj\u012b Anaga, wife of Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Mu. Ghaznav\u012b who was the Prince's nurse (anaga). (Unless indeed the word is \u0101ghah and refers to Shamsu-d-d\u012bn.)\n\nIn the Akbarn\u0101ma (II. 55) we are told that M\u0101ham Anaga had served the prince from his cradle, but it does not follow that she first did so in the capacity of wet-nurse. It may be remarked too that the fact of our not hearing that she had a husband or a child of about Akbar's age militates against the notion that she was his wet-nurse. Though her son, Adham Kh\u0101n was a young man at the time of his death, he was probably several years older than Akbar as otherwise B\u0101yaz\u012bd would hardly have named him in the list of servants in Akbar's train at the time when Hum\u0101y\u016bn marched to India.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nACCOUNT OF THE ARRIVAL OF HIS MAJESTY AT THE WORLD-TRaversing CAMP OF HIS MAJESTY JAHANBANI JANNA-T-ASHYANI, FROM THE PORT OF AMARKOT AND OF THE AUSPICIOUS CONJUNCTION.\n\nAs the world-seeing eye and auspicious glance of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b was looking for the glorious vision of the king of kings, a gracious order was issued that he should be brought to the curtain of honour and encampment of fortune, in charge of her Majesty Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b. Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2019azzam, Nadim K\u016bkal-t\u0101gh and Shamsu-d-din Mu. of Ghazni were sent to be in attendance on the auspicious litter. Accordingly his Majesty left Amarkot, on the 11th Sha\u2019b\u0101n in a fortunate hour, under the care and in the arms of her Highness Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b and departed in a travelling litter.\n\n---\n\n1 The heading of this chapter is omitted in the text and the account of Akbar\u2019s visit to his father is made part of Chapter IX. But the heading is given in No. 564 and other MSS. and is clearly required.\n\nThe Persian is as follows:\n\n\u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0642\u062f\u0648\u0645 \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0634\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0628\u0645\u0648\u062c\u0628 \u06af\u06cc\u062a\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a \u062c\u0646\u062a \u0622\u0634\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062d\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0639\u0631\u06a9\u0648\u062a \u0648 \u062a\u0631\u06a9 \u0633\u0639\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u0646\n\nIn the Lucknow ed. bam\u016bfib is, apparently by mistake, substituted for bamaukib.\n\n2 According to Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, the meeting-place was in pargana J\u0101n.

Avant-couriers of good tidings were arriving every\nminute and bringing, from time to time, the news of the appro-\npinquating of the glorious advent.\n\nVerse.\n\nThe cavalcade approaches with the king of both worlds in its\nwake,\u00b3\n\nThe caravan of joy goes forth to meet him.\n\nAnd on the last day of Sha'b\u0101n which was the day for the\nglorious alighting, and when the camp of good fortune was only one\nstage distant, his Majesty (Hum\u00e2y\u016bn) was pleased to observe\n\"Assuredly the child is compact of auspiciousness, of potent horos-\ncope and has the good fortune of the two worlds enfolded in him, for,\nas he draws nigh, there is another\u2074 assemblage of spectators in the\nupper world who exhibit a virgin joy.\" What marvel is it that the\npure soul and illumined intellect of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat\n\n\u00b9 Meaning the takht-i-rav\u0101n (travelling-litter.)\n\u00b2 Lit.: eyes of the Sult\u0101nat.

It literally means tail.\n-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b should be cognizant of the Divine secrets and be aware of the truths hidden in celestial treasuries? Or how is it strange that there should be an epiphany on the apparition of his Majesty, the king of kings, the shadow of God, the archetype of the strange frontispieces of the universe, and collection of the catalogues of the perfections of the sons of Adam? And in an hour which held the auspicious influences of the conjunctions of the two Fortunes\u00b9 and of the two luminaries (the Sun and Moon), his Majesty (Akbar) alighted with felicity and dominion at the majestic and glorious enclosure, and became fortunate by arriving at the station of light and took repose under the shadow of the phoenix (hum\u0101) of eternal prosperity. The blessed crown (t\u0101rak, i.e., crown of the head) of his Majesty, the king of kings, was made fortunate by touching the throne-brushing feet of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and by becoming united to a perfect saint (p\u012br). The latter took him lovingly in his arms and kissed him on the luminous brow, the tablet of the fortunes of the two worlds and title-page of happiness everlasting.\n\nVerse.\n\nWhiles he held him to his lip, whiles to his heart, and whiles to his head.\n\nAfter gazing on this holy light, the inspired tongue engaged in returning thanks to the Lord God, Most High and Most Glorious, and the pole-star-like\u00b2 head was lowered in supplicating prostration at the portals of the All-sufficient One.\n\nVerse.\u00b3\n\nNot only was the head ever bowed,\nEach hair of his body also bent in adoration.\n\nThe guardians of the Divine bounty and the treasurers of infinite auspiciousness delivered that deposit of eternities\u2014past and\n\n\u00b9 Jupiter and Venus; but perhaps this is only a rhetorical way of describing the meeting between Akbar and his father or his arrival in his mother's company. The time being the end of the month would be that of the conjunction of the Sun and Moon.\n\n\u00b2 fargad, a bright star near the Pole. The word is often written \u0641\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652 and applied to two bright stars, \u03b2 and \u03b3, in the Little Bear.

The letters\n\"Shadow of God\" were apparent in the lines of his palm. The\nwitnesses of Reason were visible in the composite of his substance.\nThe notes of Theosophy were manifest in his whole being. Justice\nwas demonstrated in the evenness of his temperament. Proofs\nof beneficence were revealed in the essence of his nature. The\ncharacters of a Lord of Conjunction shone out from the fair schedules\nof his ephemeris. Knowledge of occult sciences was evidenced in\nthe illumined records of his constitution. Remote mysteries were\nrevealed by his keen sight. Far-reaching thoughts streamed out\nfrom his lofty glance.\n\n\\(^1\\) The allusion probably is to the\nthreshold of the Caliph's palace at\nBaghdad which contained a piece of\nthe famous black stone of Mecca.\nSee Richardson's Dict. s. v. dar and\nD'Herb\u00e9lot art. B\u0101b.\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nACCOUNT OF SOME OF THE WONDERFUL ETEOSTICS ON THE AUSPICIOUS\nBIRTH OF HIS MAJESTY, THE KING OF KINGS.\n\nIngenious men made eteostics in prose and verse on the noble nativity and composed gratulatory odes. They tendered them for acceptance at the Court of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b which was the assay-room of human jewels, and received glorious gifts.\n\nAmong them, this chronogram by Maul\u0101n\u0101 N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Tarkh\u0101n\u00b9 received the palm of applause and approbation.\n\nQuatrain.\n\nWhen the fateful pen of destiny wrote the record,\nIt added a comment to the immortal verse\nAnd wrote, \u201cFrom the birth-boon of the world\u2019s king of kings\n\u201cThe date is Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h Jah\u0101ng\u012br.\u201d\u00b2 (World-seizing king of kings.)\nAnd this wonderfully apposite chronogram was discovered by one of the learned of the Age.\n\nVerse.\n\nLaus Deo! there has come into being\nHe who is the world\u2019s epitome,\nA king greater than the kings of the Earth,\n\n\u00b9 For an account of him, see Blochmann No. 55, (541) and Bad\u0101oni III. 157 and especially 197.

The text has an \u016b and the editors remark that this makes the number of years six too much, viz.: 955, but that if the \u016b be excluded as in one of their MSS. the letters give the correct date, 949. I find that the Lucknow ed. and No. 564 omit the \u016b. The letters give 949 thus:\n\n| Letter | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| \u0634     | 300   |\n| \u0628     | 2     |\n| \u064a     | 10    |\n| \u0643     | 20    |\n| \u0646     | 50    |\n| \u062c     | 3     |\n| \u0628     | 2     |\n\nAccording to Mu. calculation Akbar was born on Sunday night, for they count the night first and then the day, beginning at sunset, but according to ordinary parlance, he was born on Saturday night, i.e., early on Sunday morning.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nTHANKSGIVING OF AB\u016a'L-FA\u017bL, THE AUTHOR OF THIS NOBLE VOLUME,\nFOR HAVING BEHELD THE TIME OF THIS SOVEREIGNTY AND FOR\nHAVING LONG SERVED HIS MAJESTY THE KING OF KINGS.\n\nAlthough it be a heavy sorrow that, at the rising of the Luminary of Fortune, the author of this noble volume was in the abode of non-existence,\\(^1\\) without being or the adornment of Divine worship, yet how can he discharge his debt of thanks for the grand mercy of his having witnessed the era of the subjectively and objectively Great One, the ruler of the visible and the invisible? and of having been one on whom has fallen the glance of his favour and guidance? And hundreds more of thanks for this, that, ere he had seen the holy horoscope, or its noble secrets and wondrous glories had been revealed to him, he had understood that perfection of sanctity and sovereignty which is beyond the reach of the astrologer's science, and was a slave of the Divine power.\\(^2\\) And praise upon praise be to God that I am not, like Im\u0101mu-l-kal\u0101m, \u1e24ass\u0101nu-l-\u2018ajam, Lis\u0101nu-l-\u1e25aqqat, \u1e24ak\u012bm Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b,\\(^3\\) sighing for the Lord of the Age who is indispensable for the control of the visible and invisible worlds. For instance he has written thus:\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ab\u016b'l-fa\u017cl was born 14th Jan., 1551, so that he was 8 years and 3 months younger than Akbar.\n\n\\(^2\\) The author is referring, in part, to the supposed fact that the true horoscope of Akbar was not known until 1583.\n\n\\(^3\\) Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b is a famous Persian poet who died at Tabr\u012bz in 580 (1185), according to one account and in 595 (1199) according to another. The lines quoted by A. F. are to be found in Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b's Quatrains, (St. Petersburg ed. 1875) p. 26, Rub\u0101'\u012b 145 and p. 18, Rub\u0101'\u012b 101. See also J. A. S. B. New Series xxxvi. Oct., 1841, 156. For account of Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b, see M. Khanykov's M\u00e9moire, Journal Asiatique, Sixth Series, 1864, iv, 137 et seq. and 1865, v, 298.\nQuatrain.\n\nThey say that every thousand years of the world\nThere comes into existence a true man.\nHe came before this, ere we\\(^1\\) were born from nothingness,\nHe will come after this when we have departed in sorrow.\n\nElsewhere he says,\nEvery now\\(^2\\) and then, the world is saturated with wretches,\nThen a shining soul comes down out of the sky.\nKh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b! seek not in this Age for such a thing,\nSit not by the way for the caravan will come late.\n\nBy auspicious good fortune, I obtained the service of this issuer of universal orders and expicator of the ways, and by the favour of his patronage and exalted kindness, comfort was brought to my soul,\u2014perturbed by the deceptions of the day and dumb-founded in a wilderness of wants,\u2014and no connexion with the world nor anxiety remained save to acquire his favour which indeed is tantamount to the pleasing of God. And my mind being freed from the bondage of secularity and the restraints of the world, was neither agitated\\(^3\\) by regret for the past nor longing for the future. Hereafter\\(^4\\) there will be given in its proper place, an account of my obtaining the blessing of his service, of my reaching the shade of favour and kindness, and of my being exalted above the apices of honour and eminence to the Seventh\\(^5\\) Heaven of cognition (ma\u02bfrifat).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I adopt the reading of the St. Petersburg MS. and No. 564, of \\(m\u0101\\) instead of the \\(y\u0101\\) of the Text.\n\n\\(^2\\) See text, p. 51, l.5 fr. foot, for the word har-yak-chand\u012b.\n\n\\(^3\\) The allusion is to Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b's quatrain. A. F. means that having, like Raphael in Hypatia, found the true man, he neither sighs for a past appearance nor longs for a future advent. Cf. Wordsworth's \"The past unsighed for and the future sure.\"\n\n\\(^4\\) See Text III. 83ff. A. F. was introduced to Akbar in the 19th year, 981 (1574).\n\n\\(^5\\) Ghurfat. paradise. It means first an upper chamber and hence is used to denote the Seventh Heaven or highest place in Paradise. (Lane 2249c.) A. F. means that, by acquiring Akbar's intimacy, he has risen higher than if he had had high office and distinguished outward rank. Blochmann remarks (xxviii) that A. F. \"never accepted a title.\" But this is rather a question-begging phrase. He is No. 71 in the list of Man\u1e63abd\u0101rs, being a Commander of Four Thousand and he had the title of 'All\u0101m\u012b. B\u0101yaz\u012bd calls him Naw\u0101b.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nARRANGEMENT OF THE LOFTY-TITLED LINE AND LIST OF THE NOBLE NAMES OF THE EMINENT ANCESTORS OF HIS MAJESTY,\nTHE KING OF KINGS.\n\nThe following list gives the excellent appellations of the heaven-descended forefathers of his Majesty, who are linked to celestial ancestors by degrees of exaltation and gradations of greatness, and all of whom came as kings, kings of kings, kingdom-bestowers and king-makers, and governed the world by God-given wisdom and true insight, such as justice and equity require, so that they have left behind them on this earth the reverberation of a good name, which is a second life, or rather, is life eternal.\n\nList.*\n\n1.

Q\u0101culi is also spelled Q\u0101j\u016bli. He was twin-brother of Qabal Kh\u0101n, the ancestor of Cingtz Kh\u0101n. In accordance with his father, Tumana\u2019s interpretation of his dream, he became Commander-in-Chief. (See his biography infra.)\n\n\\(^2\\) Spelled also S\u016bghu-jijan.

See Jarrett III. 344n., where it is transliterated Novian. See also Farhang-i-Rashidi II. 277. Quatrem\u00e8re (Rash\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn, Trans. 76.) says, \u201cLe mot noian \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0646 ou noin qui appartient \u00e0 la langue mongole, d\u00e9signait le chef d\u2019un toman, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire d\u2019un corps de dix mille hommes.\u201d\n\n\\(^4\\) Blochmann (Genealogical Table) calls him Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mir\u0101n Sh\u0101h and A. F. does so too. (Text 81.)\n\n\\(^5\\) Gulbadan mentions that B\u0101bar took the title of P\u0101dsh\u0101h after the birth of Humay\u016bn. P\u0101dsh\u0101h was changed to B\u0101dsh\u0101h in India because, says Blochmann, P\u0101d means crepitus ventris.\n\n\\(^6\\) In the preface of the Persian translation of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rat, (B.M. No. 5638, p.8.) A. F. calls him Ab\u016b\u02bel-fat\u1e25 and this is the name given in the document drawn up by A.F.\u2019s father, Mub\u0101rak, and others and preserved by Bad\u0101oni. (Blochmann 185 and Lowe 279.) There too he is styled Gh\u0101zi. A.F. also uses the title Ab\u016b\u02bel-fat\u1e25 in the introductory verses of the Tafs\u012br-i-Akbari or Great\nLet it not be concealed that the auspicious record of these high-born ones is implanted and contained in the breast-pages\\(^1\\) of the transmitters of words, and recorded and expressed by the conserving tongues of the writings of epochs, as far as Yalduz who is the 25th\\(^2\\) (i.e., counting upwards) in ascent from his Majesty and that for the period from Mangali Khwaja to Il Khan\\(^3\\) which may be reckoned as 2,000\\(^4\\) years, nothing has come to light. The cause of this will be explained hereafter.\n\nFrom Il Khan to Adam there are 24\\(^5\\) persons. These have\n\nCommentary which he presented to Akbar on his second introduction to him in 982 (1574). (The abjad value of the words Tafsir-i-Akbari is 983, but the introduction took place in 982 H. See Insh\u0101, III.) The full name of the Emperor as there given is Ab\u016b'l-fat\u1e25 Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar Sh\u0101h Al-Gh\u0101zi, and it would seem that the Commentary which A.F. then presented was on the opening of the \u0160\u016bratu-l-fat\u1e25, in allusion to Akbar's name and also to his recent victories in Bengal. On the other hand, Faizi (Nal \u016b Daman Calcutta ed. 1831. 24.) calls Akbar, Ab\u016b'l-mugaffar Jam\u0101lu-d-daula \u016b Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Akbar. Perhaps Mu\u1e93affar was the original name and was changed to Fat\u1e25 after the victories in Bengal and to assimilate it to the name of Akbar's favourite residence, Fat\u1e25pur Sikri. The words Mu\u1e93affar and Fat\u1e25 are nearly synonymous, one meaning a victory or victorious, and the other victory.\n\nThis seems a fitting place, for noting that the first letter of the word Akbar is short and the Emperor's name should not be pronounced \u0100kbar but \u0100kbar. Hence the word used to be written in English Ukbar or Ukber. The word Akbarn\u0101ma has a double meaning; it may signify the History of Akbar and also the Great or Supreme Book. It is perhaps rather significant that both A.F. and his brother should omit the title of Gh\u0101zi which was given to the young Akbar after the defeat of Hem\u0101.\n\n\\(^1\\) Or, pages issuing from.\n\n\\(^2\\) That is counting Akbar as No. I. According to the series given by the author, Yalduz (it is Yalduz, No. 2, and the No. 29 of the English list), is the 24th jadd or ancestor of Akbar. Either on this account or because he found four in his MS. Chalmers has 24th ancestor.\n\n\\(^3\\) Apparently this should be Qiy\u0101n Kh\u0101n for he is described as the son and not merely as the descendant of Il Khan. For a similar reason, it should be Timur T\u0101sh and not Mangali Khwaja.\n\n\\(^4\\) It will be pointed out hereafter that A.F. has greatly overstated the time during which the Mughals were in Ir\u011fanaqun. Other historians give the time as between 400 and 500 years.\n\n\\(^5\\) Chalmers makes this 25, and this is correct, unless one exclude Il Khan himself.\nbeen described by historians, and a brief account of them will be given.\n\nFar-sighted philosophers who with ripe judgment and God-given wisdom, have investigated the records of the past, and who have made the recognition of truth a sacred trust, and who exhibit research in the weighing of facts, are aware that the hearsay reports and traditions about man's origin occurring 7,000 years ago is a thing not to be accepted by sages who contemplate the rise\\(^1\\) and decay of the world and (can appreciate all the tones) of the seven climes.\n\nIn these matters, right-thinking and far-seeing Reason, after true and just investigation, sometimes answers in the negative, and sometimes, out of caution\u2014that baiting place of tranquillity and station of wisdom\u2014delays either to admit or to deny.\n\nBy help of Reason\u2014the glory of the world,\u2014and the assistance of trustworthy records and reliable statements about the world, such as the ancient books of India and Cathay (\\textit{Khit\u0101}), etc., which have been preserved from the agitations of accidents and with which agree the principles of astronomy and the conclusions of astronomical observations, (and such things yield trustworthy evidence) and also from the successive series of the biographies of the sages of those countries and the catena of opinions of this disciplined body (philosophers), it appears that the beginning of the world and of mortals and the source of the manifestations of the Divine attributes has not been discovered. Either it is eternal, as was the opinion of many ancient philosophers, or of such antiquity as to approximate to eternity.\n\nThe sect of Si\u016brh\u0101\\(^2\\) (Jains) who are pre\u00ebminent in all the countries of India for austerity, asceticism and science, divide time\u2014\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lit. observe the spring and autumn of the four-fold garden (i.e., the world) and know the gamut of the seven assemblages from the highest the lowest notes\u2014\\textit{anjuman}, which I presumes here means climes and not the planets.\n\n\\(^2\\) Colebrooke says (As. Res. IX. 291.) \"In Hindustan, the Jains are usually called Syauras but distin-\n\nguish themselves into Sr\u0101vacas and Yatis.\" The name does not seem to be in use now. I do not know its origin unless it be a corruption of \u0100v\u0113t\u0101mbara. (See Jarrett IV, 210n.)\n\nThe name Syaura was evidently in common use in S\u016brat in the middle of the last century for Anquetil du Perron refers to it and\ncalled k\u0101l in the Indian language\u2014into two parts. One is Avasarpin\u012b (descending cycle), i.e., the period whose beginning is joyful and end grievous, and the other is Utsarpin\u012b (ascending cycle), i.e., the opposite of the first. Each of these periods is divided into six parts, called \u0101ras.1 Each \u0101ra has a distinct name in accordance with its speciality.\n\nThe first \u0101ra of the Avasarpin\u012b is called Sukhm\u0101n-sukhm\u0101n, the meaning of the reduplication being that this portion brings joy upon joy and happiness upon happiness. The length of this happy time is four k\u014dr\u0101k\u014dr-s\u0101gar. The name of the second \u0101ra is Sukhm\u0101n, i.e., a time of felicity and joy. Its duration is three k\u014dr\u0101k\u014dr-s\u0101gar. The name of the third \u0101ra is Sukhm\u0101n (Sukhm\u0101n) Dukhm\u0101n, i.e., sorrow and misfortune crop up in the time of joy. Its duration is two k\u014dr\u0101k\u014dr-s\u0101gar. The fourth \u0101ra is called Dukhm\u0101n-sukhm\u0101n, i.e., joy and freedom from care rise up in the time of grief and sorrow. Its duration is less than one k\u014dr\u0101k\u014dr by 42,000 years.\n\nThe fifth \u0101ra is Dukhm\u0101n being the opposite of the second which was Sukhm\u0101n. The duration of this \u0101ra is 21,000 years. The sixth \u0101ra is Dukhm\u0101n-dukhm\u0101n being the opposite of the first. Its length is likewise 21,000 years. The names of the \u0101ras of the second period (Utsarpin\u012b) are the same but the first of them corresponds to the sixth \u0101ra of the first period, the second to the fifth, the third to the fourth, and the fourth to the third, the fifth to the second, and the sixth to the first of the first period. Their opinion is that at the\n\nsays, (Discours Pr\u00e9aliminaire, 365), that the two leading classes of Hind\u016bs at S\u016brat are the Br\u0101hmans and the Scionras. He calls those, Hind\u016b priests, and says that they also go by the name of Djettis (Yat\u012bs). They seldom marry, he says, dress in white and have the head uncovered and wear their hair short, \u201clike the Abb\u00e9s in France.\u201d They carry a \u201cballet\u201d (brush) to clean the places where they sit down, lest they should crush an insect. In a note, he says that the Scionras call the first man Rikaba Deva and his mother, Maru Devi, and that they say these beings were created by God in Aiodha, i.e., the north of Delhi (Oudh?). Probably, however, Aio-dha is a misprint for Agroha or Agaroa. (See Tiefenthaler I. 135, where Sarang is probably a mistake for Scionra). Perhaps this is why they compared (See Text) the hair of yugala infants with that of Delhi children.\n\n1 Sanskrit \u0905\u0930\u093e, a spoke in time\u2019s wheel.\n2 So also As. Res. IX. 258. Major Mackenzie\u2019s account of the Jains.\npresent day, two thousand and odd years of the fifth \u0101ra of the first period have elapsed.\n\nBe it known\\(^1\\) that the arithmeticians of India call 100,000 a lak; ten laks a pray\u0101t, ten pray\u0101ts a kr\u014dr, one hundred kr\u014drs an arb, ten arbs a kharba, ten kharbs a nikharb, ten nikharbs a mah\u0101sar\u016bj or padm, ten padms a sankha, and ten sankhas a samudr or k\u014dr\u0101k\u014dr.\n\nBe it known also that their opinion is that in a former period, in a particular place, a son and a daughter were born at each birth, a notion also prevalent amongst ourselves.\\(^2\\)\n\nThis sect thinks also that the hair of the infants of the district of Delhi is 4096 times coarser than the hair of those beings whom they call jugl\u0113 \\(^3\\) (yugala).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) As to these numbers, see Jarrett III. 111 and Faizi's L\u012bl\u0101kat\u012b, Cal. 1828, 7 and 8. The statement in the text may be put into tabular form as follows:\n\n| Number          | Name     |\n|-----------------|----------|\n| 100,000         | lak      |\n| 1,000,000       | pray\u0101t   |\n| 10,000,000      | kr\u014dr     |\n| 100,000,000     | arb      |\n| 1,000,000,000   | kharb    |\n| 10,000,000,000  | nikharb  |\n| 100,000,000,000 | mah\u0101sar\u016bj or padm |\n| 1,000,000,000,000 | sankha |\n| 10,000,000,000,000 | samudr or k\u014dr\u0101k\u014dr |\n\nIn Text it is stated that 100 kr\u014drs, i.e., 1000 millions = an arb but this is probably a mistake for 10 kr\u014drs. (See the scale in \u0100\u012bn, Jarrett III, 111.) Cf. \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0938\u0930\u0941\u091c\u0903 \u2014 Mah\u0101sar\u016bj Great Lake-born, i.e., the lotus, Monier Williams (Dictionary 761a); says it is equal to mah\u0101mbuja, i.e., a billion.\n\n\\(^2\\) A.F. is apparently referring to the Mu. tradition that Eve produced twins at every birth, viz., a boy and a girl. He may also be referring to the views of the Gerbanites as given by Abraham Ecchellensis (Principles of Geology, Lyell, Chap. II). In that case, the words son and daughter should be translated male and female.\n\n\\(^3\\) (Jarrett IV. 196 and 200.) Sansc. yugala, a pair. I do not know why the number 4096 has been selected; 4896 is given in the \u0100\u012bn as the period that had elapsed from the reign of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira to 40th Akbar (Jarrett II. 15) and also as that from the Deluge to the time of writing the \u0100\u012bn, i.e., 40th Akbar (1596 A.D.). Perhaps 4096 is a mistake for 4896.\n\nThe passage (about the hair) occurs also at \u0100\u012bn II. 104 (Jarrett III. 200) but there seems an error in the \u0100\u012bn (Text) inasmuch as it represents the hair of a yugala child as 4096 times thicker than that of a Delhi child. The point, however, clearly is that the chopped hair (See Text infra) used for filling the cavity, be excessively fine, to wit, that of a yugala.\nAnd they say that if the hair of a seven days old jugli infant, which is excessively fine, be subdivided to the uttermost and an abyss (lit., a well) ten miles in depth, breadth and length, be filled with such particles and after a lapse of a hundred years, one segment be taken out, the time in which, at this rate, the abyss will be emptied is a palipam (? \u092a\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e palya). And when ten samudr,\u2014an explanation of which term has already been given,\u2014of palipam(s) have elapsed, the period is a s\u0101gar. The durations of the aforesaid cycles transcend, in their opinion, the power of calculation or description. Their opinion also is that for the management of the visible and invisible world, twenty-four venerable men (\u0101dam) come forth from the hidden universe into the apparent one, every six \u0101ras and then pass away. The name of the first of these is \u0100din\u0101th and they call him also Raghun\u0101th. The sway of this chosen one of God lasts fifty krors of laks of s\u0101garas. The name of the last is Mah\u0101v\u012bra. His sway lasts for 20,000 years, of which 2,000 have elapsed at the present day. And the belief of this sect is that these twenty-four have come into existence many times and will come again many times.\n\nchild, which is 4096 times finer than that of a Delhi child and that of a seven days' yugala child being still finer. Colebrooke (As. Res. i. c. 313) quotes H\u014dmacandra's Vocabulary, and says, \"I do not find that he anywhere explains the space of 'time denominated s\u0101gara or ocean. But I understand it to be an extravagant estimate of the time which would elapse before a vast cavity, filled with chopped hairs, could be emptied at the rate of one piece of hair in a century; the time required to empty such a cavity measured by yojanas every way is a palya and this repeated ten cotis of cotis times in a s\u0101gara 1,000,000,000,000,000 palayas = one s\u0101gara or s\u0101garopama.\"\n\n1 Four k\u014ds, but the Indian word is y\u014djana.\n2 The \u0100in has 100 years, and this seems the correct reading here for B.M. MSS. Nos. 5610 and 1709 have har sad s\u0101l, every hundred years. In the text is sad has\u0101r, a hundred thousand.\n3 This is, apparently, differently stated in the \u0100in (Jarrett III, 192), but perhaps the meaning of the \u0100in (Text) is only that 24 demiurges appear in each \u0101ra and live for three or four \u0101ras.\n4 The text has Mah\u0101d\u0113\u015b, but this is clearly a clerical error. (See \u0100in II. 99, 1.4), where the spelling is given. The error is apparently repeated at II. 106, 1.3 fr. foot.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nOPINIONS OF THE BRAHMA.\n\nThe Brahma of India whose teachings and practices are observed by the majority of Indians, are agreed that the revolutions of the world consist of four Ages. The first, the period of which is 1,728,000 years, they call the Sat Yug. In this Age every single action of mankind is right, and high and low, rich and poor, great and small make truth and uprightness their rule, and show a walk and conversation pleasing to God. The natural life of man in this Age is 100,000 years.\n\nThe second Age is called Treta and lasts 1,296,000 years. In it, three-fourths of mankind follow ways well-pleasing to God, and the natural duration of life is 10,000 years.\n\nThe third Age is called the Dwapar and lasts 864,000 years. In it, one-half of mankind speak and act rightly, and the natural life is 1,000 years.\n\nThe fourth Age is the Kal Yug. Its period is 432,000 years. During it, three-fourths of mortals follow ways of falsehood and unrighteousness, and the natural life is 100 years.\n\nThis school firmly believes that every now and then the Life-Giver of mankind and producer of beings, brings an ascetic and sage from the veil of concealment and non-existence to the palace of manifestation and existence and makes him the instrument for the creation of the world. This mighty one is called Brahm\u0101. Their belief is that a Brahm\u0101 lives 100 years, each consisting of 360 days and every day\n\n---\n\n1 Anquetil du Perron remarks (Tieffenhaler II. XXI), that the fourth Age has served to form the first three by adding successively 432,000.\n\n2 Tajarrud-nih\u0101d \u016b danish-nish\u0101d.\n\n3 The word day is used here in two senses, first as the nycthemeron or day of 24 hours and then in its ordinary sense, as opposed to night. There seems to be an error in the Text \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \"a thousand and\" being a mistake for \u0647\u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u06cc\u060c a thousandfold. The meaning is \"equal to a thousand of four Ages, i.e., Mah\u0101yug(s).\" The \"1,000 Mah\u0101yug(s)\" is apparently a statement in round numbers, the more exact figures being 980, for each Manu existed for 70 kalpas (71 according to another account) or Mah\u0101yug(s) and as there are 14 successive Manus in a day of Brahm\u0101, the length of it is $70 \\times 14 = 980$. Firighta has copied A.F. (he acknowledges this, stating that he is epitomizing A.F.'s translation of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata), but he has gone to A.F.'s preface rather than to the Akbarn\u0101ma. See his Introduction.\nand every night is equal to a thousand times four Ages (Mah\u0101yug.) In their opinion, the number of Brahm\u0101s who have come into existence cannot be known by the human intellect, but they say that according to what has been received from authorities\\(^1\\) on the subject of Brahm\u0101, the present Brahm\u0101 is the thousand and first, and that fifty years and half\\(^2\\) a day of the life of this wondrous being have elapsed at the present time.\n\nThe writer of this divine masterpiece has written the account of these two doctrines according to the translation of learned and pious Indians\\(^3\\) from their venerated books. Also in the writings of Shaikh Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Elliot-Dowson\u2019s trans. VI. 532 E. n. E.) A.F.\u2019s preface to the Persian translation of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is to be found in the B.M. Add. No. 5638. It was written in the 32nd Akbar and contains an account of the four Ages corresponding to that in the Text. (See l. c. 12a).\n\nI find in the \u0100ntiparvan\u2014(Twelfth Book of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata)\u2014(II, 237, Pratap Chandra Rai\u2019s tran.) that the four Yugs (Ages) contain 12,000 years of the gods, i.e., \\(432,000 \\div 360\\); and that this period is called a D\u0113vayug. \u201cA thousand such Yugas (i.e., D\u0113vayugas or Mah\u0101yugas) compose a single day of Brahm\u0101. The same is the duration of Brahm\u0101\u2019s night.\u201d\n\n\\(^2\\) qi\u1e63\u0101t, \u201ctrustly friends or confidants.\u201d For use of this word, see Text 121 I.12. A.F. probably means here Manu or the Manus. Fir\u016bghta has copied the expression and Professor Dowson (Elliot VI. 563) translates, \u201cI have heard from my Br\u0101hma\u1e47a friends, etc.\u201d\n\n\\(^3\\) It would seem from the \u0100in (Jarrett II, 15) that the half day has not fully expired, for we are told that 14 Manus appear in each of Brahm\u0101\u2019s days. When A.F. was writing, 50 years had elapsed, and consequently \\(360 \\times 14 = 5,040\\) Manus had appeared. But instead of 7 Manus of the first day of the 51st year\u2019s having appeared, i.e., the number that appear in half a day, we are told that only 6 Manus had appeared and departed, and that only a portion of the time of the 7th, viz., 27 kalpas, 3 yugas and 4,700 years of the 4th Yug had elapsed. If this be correct, the 7th Manu had then more than half his time to run, viz., 43 kalpas out of his 70.\n\n\\(^4\\) See Jarrett III, 210 where A.F. speaks of having got his information about the Jains from learned men of the \u0100v\u012bt\u0101mbara order, and says that he could not get exact information about the tenets of the Digambaras (sky-clad.)\n\n\\(^5\\) Apparently the writer referred to is Mu\u1e25y\u012b\u2019u-d-d\u012bn Ibnu-l-\u2018Arab\u012b, author of the Fu\u1e63\u016b\u1e63u-l-hikam (\u1e24\u0101j\u012b Khalfa IV. 424). See Rieu\u2019s Cat. II. 831b, item III. and 832b, Item XVII. and Ar. Cat. No. 233. He was also the author of the Fut\u016b\u1e25\u0101l-i-mak-k\u012byah (see Rieu II, 874b) and of a number of definitions appended to Jor-\nand Shaikh Sa\u2019du-d-din Ham\u012b who were great saints and masters of exposition and ecstasy, it is stated in the explanation of Divine (Il\u0101h\u012b) days and of Rabb\u0101n\u012b days that each Rabb\u0101n\u012b day is made up of 1,000 years and every Divine day of 50,000. And the author of Naf\u0101\u2019isul-fun\u016bn has related that in the histories of Cathay, it\n\nj\u0101n\u012b in Fl\u00fcgel\u2019s ed. The latter gives the name as \u201cMohied-din Mohammed b. Ali Hatimi Ta\u1e63\u1e6d vulgo Ibn Arabi dictus,\u201d and says he died in 638-1240. A.F. refers to Mu\u1e25y\u012b\u2019ud-d\u012bn in the \u0100\u02be\u012bn (II. 221 and Jarrett III. 373.) See also Bad\u0101oni, Lowe, 265.\n\n1 Apparently Sa\u2019du-d-d\u012bn Mu. B. al-Mu\u2019sayyad Ham\u012b who died 650 H. (Rieu 755a and 1095a.) He is referred to in the \u0100\u02be\u012bn (Jarrett III. 390), and there is a short notice of him in Prince D\u0101r\u0101 Shikoh\u2019s Sayjnatu-l-auliya where it is stated that he died in Khur\u0101s\u0101n 650 H. (1252 A.D.)\n\n2 \u1e5bab\u012b rabb\u0101n\u012b. Lane defines this as meaning one who devotes himself to religious services or exercises, or applies himself to excess of devotion. He does not give the meaning of \u201ca period of time,\u201d but states that \u1e5bab\u012b, the sing. of \u1e5bub\u016bb, means thousand, and that some say it means 10,000. Richardson gives \u1e5bab\u012b as meaning thousands, a myriad. In the second Epistle of St. Peter ii. 8, we have the expression (as pointed out, I believe by Sale) \u201cOne day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.\u201d See also Psalm xc. 4. In the preface to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rat, A.F. refers to the views of Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b and Im\u0101m Ja\u2019far \u1e62\u0101diq.\n\nSee Rieu II. 435a for an account of this work. It is an encyclopaedia written by Mu. B. Ma\u1e25m\u016bdul-l-\u0101mul\u012b. I have not in B.M. Ms. No.16827, been able to find the passage referred to by A.F., but the volume is thick and has no index. See Jarrett II. 19, where we are told that 8,884 wans 60 years, have elapsed up to the date, of the \u0100\u02be\u012bn. These figures seem inconsistent with those of the Text, and apparently both are wrong. D\u2019Herbelot (art. Van.) states that the Mughals reckon that 874 H. corresponds to the 8863rd. van of 10,000 years each, and then adds that 874 H. corresponds to 1443 A.D. In the end, the figures will come out nearly as A.F.\u2019s if we substitute a six for an eight in the \u0100\u02be\u012bn figures, making them 8864 and insert an eight in our text so as to read 8863 instead of 863.\n\nHere we are told that 863 wans, 9,800 years, had elapsed from the time of Adam to 735 H.=1334 A.D. Consequently, 1003 H., 1594 A.D. the 40th Akbar and the date of the \u0100\u02be\u012bn would correspond with 864 wans, 60 years, for 1594\u20141334=260 years.\n\n874 H. is 88,639,860 years from the Creation. 847 H.=1443 A.D., so that this calculation agrees pretty nearly with that quoted by A.F. for 1334 A.D., viz., 8863 wans 9800 years, the difference being 109-60=49 years. S\u00e9dillot refers to a passage of\nis written that from the time of Adam Ab\u016b-l-bashar (Father of mankind) till now (i.e., the date when the author of the Naf\u0101\u2019is was writing) which is 735 H., (1384 A.D.) 8863 wans\u00b9 (Text, 863) 9,800 years have elapsed.\n\nA wan with them is 10,000 years. Such is the wide expanse of God\u2019s kingdom that it is not improbable that these tales and traditions may be true. There may have been many Adams. Indeed it is stated by Im\u0101m Ja\u2019far \u1e62\u0101diq, (Peace be on him!) that there have been thousands upon thousands of Adams before the Adam who was our father. And Shaikh Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b says it is not improbable that after a Divine (Rabb\u0101n\u012b) week, which is 7,000 years and the period of the cycle\u00b2 of the sovereignty of the seven planets, one race is terminated and another Adam puts on the robe of existence.\n\nAnd now, giving truce to length of words and littleness of matter, I proceed to sketch in this glorious record, without converting\u00b3 it into extensive histories, the blissful biography of those fifty-two persons who extend\u2074 from Adam down to his Majesty, the king of kings, so that it may be a cause of increase of knowledge. As I know that this exposition of grandeur will be a complement to the account of his Majesty, the king of kings, I shall treat it with the concision which is the adornment of an author.\n\nD\u2019Herbelot which, he says, is derived from Greaves. S\u00e9billot considers that the true figures are 8863 wans, 9860 years; or 9820 according to one MS. This last figure agrees best with A.F., for in the \u0100tn (Jarrett II. 19) he says that according to the Kh\u014d\u1e6d\u0101t\u012b Era, 8884 wans 60 years have elapsed up to the date of his writing, i.e., 40th Akbar=1596 A.D. 1596-1443 =158, and this does not differ materially from 9864 wans 60 years \u20148863 wans 9820 years = 140.\n\n\u00b9 The Text has har before wan which seems a mistake.\n\u00b2 There is probably some mistake here. The cycle of the planets was generally reckoned as much longer than 7,000 years. See amongst other places, Principles of Geology, Lyell, Cap. II. Quotation from Abraham Ecchellensis. Perhaps A.F. means that each Rabb\u0101n\u012b day is 7,000 years long and that thus a Rabb\u0101n\u012b week is 49,000 years. If so, the trs. should be \u201cAfter a week of Rabb\u0101n\u012b days.\u201d\n\u00b3 Perhaps \u201cnot being satisfied with big books.\u201d The Persian is iktifa\u2019 for use of which see Text 10, l.2 fr. foot. A.F. may mean that certain voluminous histories do not give the facts properly.\n\u2074 A.F. tells us later that these 52 persons do not fill the gap between Adam and Akbar. There is no record of some 25 generations.\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nACCOUNT OF ADAM (PEACE BE UPON HIM!)\n\nIt is well-known that he came into existence about 7,000\\(^1\\) years ago through the perfect power of God, without the intervention of a father's loins or a mother's womb and that he was equably compounded of the four elements. His soul emanated from the fountain of bounty in perfection proportionate to his body. He was entitled man (\\textit{ins\u0101n}) and received the name of Adam.\n\nAt that time the first degree of Capricorn\\(^2\\) coincided with the eastern horizon, and Saturn was in that Sign, while Jupiter was in Pisces, Mars in Aries, the Moon in Leo, the Sun and Mercury in Virgo, and Venus in Libra. Some have said that at that time, all the planets were in their degrees of exaltation, but clearly this does not accord with astronomy for there is a difficulty about Mercury,\u2014the Sun's exaltation being in Aries and Mercury's in Virgo. But Mercury can never be more than 27\u00b0 distant from the Sun, how then can he be in exaltation when the Sun is in exaltation, or how can the Sun be in exaltation when Mercury is so? And reflecting on the astrological principle that Mercury takes the nature of whatever planet he be associated with, it has occurred to me that Mercury may have been in the condition of applying\\(^3\\) to some other planet which was in exaltation.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Era of Adam is described in the \\textit{\u0100tn}. (Jarrett II, 2.) All the periods given there are under 7,000 years. The \"7,000 years\" of A.F.'s authorities are probably lunar and about 211 have to be deducted to convert them into solar. Many dates of the Creation, etc., are given in the \\textit{Habibu-s-siyar}.\n\n\\(^2\\) Capricorn is Saturn's nocturnal mansion; Pisces the nocturnal mansion of Jupiter, and Aries the diurnal house of Mars. There does not seem to be any special connection between the Moon and Leo but perhaps she is there as Vizier or deputy for the Sun, who is in Virgo,\u2014the nocturnal house of Mercury,\u2014but whose mansion is Leo. Libra is the diurnal house of Venus.\n\n\\(^3\\) \\textit{Ittiq\u0101l}. This is the technical meaning of the term but A.F. may only intend that Mercury was near some other planet.\nAdam was of lofty stature, of a wheaten colour, had curling hair and a handsome countenance. There are different accounts of the stature of this patriarch, but most agree that he was sixty cubits high. Almighty God produced Eve from his left side and gave her in marriage to him, and by her he begat children. Historians have told many strange and wondrous things about this hero and though there be no difficulty about the extent of God\u2019s power, yet experienced and practical men of the world, on looking to the course of nature, rather hesitate about accepting them. It is said that at the time of his death, he had 40,000 descendants, and that his immediate children were 41, viz., 21 boys and 20 girls, but some say there were 19 girls. Seth was the most eminent of them all.\n\nSome have said that Adam wrote about elixirs (ta'fin\u0101t) and\n\n---\n\n1 The Muhammadan tradition is that Eve, at every parturition produced twins except at Seth\u2019s birth. He was born alone\u2014hence the numbers 21 males and 20 females. See account of Seth, infra.\n\n2 The Text and No. 564 have ta'fin\u0101t. Ordinarily this seems to mean evil smells or putridities, but Steingass gives also the meaning tincture\u2014\u201c(\u062a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u064a\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e tu'f\u012bn v. n. 2 of \u0645\u0650\u064a\u0650\u0651\u0646\u064e tincture).\u201d If this be taken in the sense of elixirs or efficacious drugs, it may be that ta'fin\u0101t is right and it agrees with the statement in the \u1e24ab\u012bbu-s-siyar that Adam\u2019s book dealt, among other subjects, with the properties of medicines. Yet A.F. would hardly class medicine among the occult sciences. In the sense of tincture, possibly ta'fin\u0101t has reference here to the tradition mentioned in the Prolegomena to the Zafarn\u0101ma, that when Adam was cast out of Paradise, he fell upon the mountains of Ceylon, and spent 100 years there in prayer and penitence. During this time, he wept so much that plants grew up out of the pools of his tears, and all of these were medicinal or aromatic like cloves, cinnamon, etc.\n\nIn B.M. No. MCCCVI, (p. 19) (Rieu, Ar. Cat. 601,602) which is the Ar. Text of Shahraz\u016br\u012b\u2019s T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukam\u0101, the word is not ta'fin\u0101t but apparently, alba'qin\u0101t, which does not seem to have any meaning. The passage is \u0628\u064f\u0636\u064f\u0648\u064c\u0651 \u0643\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0631\u064c \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0650\u0651\u0646\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650 ba'\u1e93i kutub fi-l-ba'qin\u0101t. Perhaps the word should be \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0650\u0651\u0646\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650 alyaqiniy\u0101t, \u201ccertainties\u201d such as articles of religion. In I.O. No. 1579, (Per. trs. of Shahraz\u016br\u012b by one Maq\u1e63\u016bd \u2018Al\u012b of Tabr\u012bz) we find (16a) that unfortunately the alba'qin\u0101t or alyaqiniy\u0101t of Shahraz\u016br\u012b\u2019s Text is represented by a word without diaritical marks. The passage is \u016b didam man ba'\u1e93i as kutubh\u0101-i-\u1e0d\u0101 dar g\u0101hir im\u0101m. Taking the illegible word to be ta'q\u012bbat fr. ta'q\u012bb, the appointing a man as chief and\nother occult sciences. For example the very learned Shahraz\u016br\u012b has so stated in his \"Lives of Philosophers.\" It is said Adam died which with s\u0101hir, may mean the external marks or indications of such a person, this may be rendered, \"And I saw various books about the marks (or notes) of an Im\u0101m\" (P\u0101n\u0101m, mankind.) Some countenance is given to this view by finding that Seth, a son of Adam, laid down 16 rules or marks of a true believer (mu'min) as if the father had laid down those of an Im\u0101m (apostle) and the son, those of a disciple.\n\nAnother suggestion which has occurred to me is that the word is al-bayyin\u0101t, demonstrations,\" and which has also the technical sense of \"cabalistic interpretations of the meanings of letters.\" This word occurs in H\u0101j\u012b Khalf\u0101's account of the S\u012bfr-i-\u0101dam (Book of Adam) (Fluegel's ed. III. 599,600.) Here we are told that Adam's book was written on 21 olive leaves of Paradise and its gates (P) and dealt with the properties of letters, etc.\n\nOne more suggestion remains, viz., that A.F.'s word is ta'f\u012bnat, i.e., Heb. tephillim, amulets or phylacteries.\" The variants in the notes to our Text do not seem of value, and MSS. which I have consulted, throw no light on the point. Evidently the word is used in an unusual sense and the copyists have been unable to understand it.\n\nThe n of ta'fiwat does not, I think, occur in the MSS. I have consulted. In the beautiful MS. of Halhed (No. 5610, 31 l.3 fr. foot) the word appears to be ta'fiyat, \"obliter-\n\nations, amendments.\" In R.A.S. No. 116 it is clearly written ta'qiy\u0101t, and this might yield a good sense for ta'qiy\u0101t (fr. 'aq\u012bl) seems to mean abstruse points in philosophy. (Lane 2114 a and b.) R.A.S. No. 117 has ta'fiyat.\n\nThis is the Im\u0101m Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Shahraz\u016br\u012b referred to by \u0100mir Khw\u0101nd (Khondam\u012br) in his Kh\u0101lasatu-l-akhb\u0101r. (Persian Munshi, Gladwin, 1801, Part II. 265,266.) The Rauzatu-s-saf\u0101 (Rehatek II. Part I.) states that he was the author both of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukama and the Nashatul-qul\u016bb (Hearts' Delight), but if so, the latter is apparently not the work described by Rieu (I. 418a.) Shamsu-d-d\u012bn is also mentioned in B.M. Ar. Cat. 209, 601, 602. The book there described is anonymous and entitled Nashatu-l-arw\u0101h u Rausat-l-afr\u0101h, \"Delights of Souls and Gardens of Joy, Oblectamen Spirituum et Viridarium Gaudiorum,\" but Dr. Rieu observes that it agrees almost entirely with the work of Shamsu-d-d\u012bn sah-Shahraz\u016br\u012b described by H\u0101j\u012b Khalf\u0101 (Fluegel VI. 321.) It is in two parts, the first, an account of ancient philosophers, the second, of those subsequent to Mu\u1e25ammad, and it contains 108 Lives (that described by H\u0101j\u012b Khalf\u0101 had 111.) Apparently T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukama is the secondary title. It seems to have been written at Ba\u1e63ra in 995 (1587). Its author wrote a commentary on Shahr\u0101wad\u012b, a philosopher who was\nin India and was buried on a mountain in Ceylon\u00b9 (an island) which lies towards the south and which is now known by the name of Qadamg\u0101h-i-\u0101dam (Adam\u2019s footprint, i.e., Adam\u2019s Peak.) He was ill 21 days and Eve died, according to one account, a year, according to another, seven years and according to a third, three days after him. Seth, his successor and administrator, buried her by Adam\u2019s side, and it is reported that Noah brought their coffin on board the Ark at the time of the Deluge, and afterwards buried them on Ab\u016b qubais.\u00b2 According to another account, they were buried in Jerusalem, and according to a third tradition, in Najf-K\u016bfa.\u00b3\n\n**Seth\u2014Peace be upon him**\n\nWas the most excellent of Adam\u2019s immediate descendants, and was born after the catastrophe of Abel. It is said that whenever Eve became pregnant, she gave birth to a son and a daughter, but that Seth was born alone. Iqlimiy\u0101,\u2074 the (twin) sister of Cain was put to death at Aleppo by Saladin in 587 (1191). (D\u2019Herb\u00e9lot s.v. Scheherverdi.) There is a Per. tra. (T.O. No. 1579) of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukam\u0101\u02be by Maq\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b of Tabriz, begun under the orders of Akbar and completed under Jah\u0101ng\u012br. The translator calls the author that pattern of writers Shamsu-l-mulka wa-d-d\u012bn Maul\u0101n\u0101 Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Muhammad Shahraz\u016br\u012b. A.F. seems to have made considerable use of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukam\u0101\u02be; his account of the three Hermes in the notice of Enoch agrees closely with the Persian of Maq\u0101d \u2018Al\u012b.\n\nShahraz\u016br is a town in the hill-country of Persia and apparently near the battle-field of Arbela. (Jarrett III. 80,81.) A.F. gives Shahraz\u016br as the name of a district also. (Meynard\u2019s Y\u0101q\u016bt, 356.) The name is said to mean the city of Z\u0101r,\u2014the son of Zoh\u0113q a Persian king and founder of the town.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 A.F. includes Ceylon in India (Hind\u016bst\u0101n.) The Arabs call the mountain on which Adam was buried, R\u0101h\u016bn.\n\n\u00b2 Richardson spells Ab\u016b Kais, after D\u2019Herb\u00e9lot, and says it is 3 m. from Mecca. (D\u2019H. s.v. Abu Cais Mecca.) Ab\u016b qubais is a mountain n. of Mecca. Abraham is said to have proclaimed from it, the institution of pilgrimage.\n\n\u00b3 Nedjif about 1\u00bd m. (2 kil.) w. of K\u016bfa. (R\u00e9clus IX. 458) (K\u016bfah. Jarret III. 64.) Najf means high land and tumulus. A.F.\u2019s account of Adam\u2019s burial-place is perhaps taken from the Naf\u0101\u02beisu-l-fun\u016bn, (B.M. No. 16,259a 827.)\n\n\u2074 Much of A.F.\u2019s account of the Patriarchs seems taken from the Rauzatu-s-saf\u0101 of Mir Khw\u0101nd (Mir-khond) and the \u1e24atibbu-s-siyar of his grandson, Khw\u0101nd Amir (Khondamir) or from their sources. The Rauzatu-s-saf\u0101 has been translated\ngiven in marriage to him (Seth.) When Adam reached the age of a thousand, he made Seth his successor, and enjoined all to submit to him. In succession to Adam, he carried on, by his weighty intellect, the administration of the temporal and spiritual worlds. He always conducted himself with outward composure and inward efficiency, and his were the only descendants who survived Noah's Flood. He is called the first Uri\u0101,\u00b9 a word which in Syriac means teacher. He occupied himself with the medical,\u00b2 mathematical and theological sciences, and spent most of his life in Syria. Many of his descendants abandoned secular affairs and practised asceticism in hermitages. He left the world when he was 912 years old. Some say that he was Adam's grandson and that his father was Sulha,\u00b3 but this tale is without foundation.\n\nin part by Mr. Rehatschek, and his translation published by the Or. Trs. Fund. This work may advantageously be consulted in connection with A.F. See also Persian Tabari, Zotenberg's trs.\n\nThe story of Iqlimiy\u0101 is given in Tabari, (Cap. XXX.) and in the Rau\u1e63atu-s-saf\u012b. According to one tradition, Cain murdered Abel on her account, as he was not willing that she should marry Abel. Her name is variously written Iqlimiy\u0101, Iqlim\u0101 (Burh\u0101n-i-q\u0101t\u012b s. v.) and by Bayle, Calmane. Iqlimiy\u0101 means litharge, foam of silver. After Abel's death, Iqlimiy\u0101 was married to Seth.\n\n\u00b9 Mu\u1e25ammadans spell this name like that of Bathsheba's husband, but there is no connection between the two persons. Uriah means \"Light of Heaven.\" (Ox. \"Helps to the Bible.\") D'Herbelot, Art. Uriai says: \"Les Arabes se servent de ce mot, qui est tir\u00e9 du Chalda\u00efque et du Syriaque Oura\u00efa et Ouro\u00efo, pour signifier un Ma\u00eetre ou Docteur de la premi\u00e8re classe, tels qu'ont \u00e9t\u00e9, Edris, Khedher, Hermes, qui portent les titres de premier, second et troisi\u00e8me Ma\u00eetres ou Docteurs de l'Univers.\" Chwolsohn in his work on the Sabeans, gives the variants, Ar\u0101ni and Ar\u0101fi and comes to the conclusion that the word is not Syriac but merely a corruption of Orpheus. See I, 782 and 800 where he says, \"sammt und sonders corruptionsen aus Orpheus.\" But may it not be connected with \u016ar, i.e., the \u016ar of the Chaldees or with the \u016br which means light? The form Ar\u0101ni is given by Mas'\u0101di (Book of Indication and Counsel, deSacy IX. 342 n.)\n\n\u00b2 This is the Mu\u1e25ammadan division of the sciences. (Blochmann 279 n.) It is derived from Aristotle.\n\n\u00b3 The Rau\u1e63atu-s-saf\u012b (Trs.) has Saf\u012bha, but is unlikely that Mr. Rehatschek spelt an Ar. word with a p.\nEnosh was born when Seth was 600 years old. A number of writers say that his mother was an immaculately-born\\(^1\\) one who, like Adam, was clothed with the garment of life without the instrumentality of father or mother. He succeeded his father in accordance with a testament, and was the first who in this cycle, laid the foundations of sovereignty.\\(^2\\) They say he reigned 600 years. According to Jewish and Christian\\(^3\\) traditions, he lived 965 years,\u2014according to Ibn Jauzi,\\(^4\\) 950,\u2014and according to Q\u0101\u1e93\u012b Baiz\u0101w\u012b,\\(^5\\) 600. He had many children.\n\nKenan\\(^6\\)\n\nKenan was the most enlightened, fortunate and sagacious of the sons of Enosh. After his father\u2019s death, this hero, in accordance with a testamentary disposition, swayed the affairs of mankind and walked in the ways of his illustrious ancestors. He erected the buildings of Babylon and founded the city of S\u016bs.\\(^7\\) They ascribe to him the first establishment of houses and gardens.\n\nThe numbers of mankind greatly increased during his time.

Quatrem\u00e8re speaks of Ibn Jauz\u012b as author of the *Mir\u0101tu-s-sam\u0101n*, but it appears that this was written by Ibn Jauz\u012b\u2019s grandson, Ab\u016bl-muzaffar Y\u016bsuf b.

According to the Persians, it was founded by H\u016bshang, grandson of Kai\u016bmar\u1e63 (Gayomars). Mir Khw\u0101nd ascribes the building of it to Kenan\u2019s son, Mahalalil and says that before the latter\u2019s time, men lived in caves.\nsettled with the descendants of Seth in Babylonia. He lived 926 years, but some say he drank the water of life, (i.e., lived) 640 years, and one school says that he consoled the sorrows of the world, (i.e., reigned) for about a century.\n\nMahalalil.\n\nMahalalil was the best of Kenan's sons. Kenan placed him on the throne when he himself had attained the age of 900. He ruled 55 for 300 years. He lived either 928 or 840 or 895 years.\n\nJared (Text, Ira'd.)\n\nJared was the most right-minded of the sons of Mahalalil and by his honoured father's orders, he administered the affairs of the world. He made canals and conduits, and attained the age of 962 or, according to some, of 967 years.\n\nAll these magnates of the household of fortune came into existence during Adam's lifetime.\n\nEnoch (Text, Ikhn\u0101kh.)\n\nEnoch is generally known as Idris, and was the distinguished son of Jared and born after Adam's death. Though the last-born of Jared's sons, he was, in wisdom and intelligence, older than all of them, and was before them all in felicity and understanding. He is the first lawgiver since the time of Seth. Some say that Idris was 100 years old at the time of Adam's death and some that he was 360 years. He was unrivalled in his knowledge of the science of government and the refinements of contrivance. Though some assign all sciences and arts to Adam, yet, according to most, astronomy, writing, spinning, weaving and sewing were introduced by Enoch. He learned wisdom from Agathod\u00e6mon of Egypt whom they call Uria the Second.\n\nAmong his lofty titles is that of Harmasu-l-har\u0101masa (Hermes of Hermes or Trismegistus) and he is also called the third Uria. He\n\n---\n\n1 Blochmann (99) mentions Idris as the inventor of the Hebrew alphabet.\n2 Text, Agh\u0101sim\u016bn. See Al-b\u012br-\u016bni's India and Chwolson on the Sabaeans.

He founded 100 cities, of which Mad\u012bna-i-roha was the least. It was a city of Mesopotamia (Jaz\u0101'ir) though some place it in the Hij\u0101z (Petraea Arabia). It was inhabited up to the time of Hul\u0101k\u016b Kh\u0101n who, it is said, destroyed it for the sake of the honour of the country and the well-being of the people.\n\nHe (Idr\u012bs) instructed every tribe and every rank of mankind by a special procedure in accordance with their capacities. They say that he guided men to the reverence of the Great Light (the Sun) for most of them, before his time, were without his abounding wisdom and did not give thanks for that light of lights. He regarded it as the stock of visible and invisible fortune, and prescribed a great festival at the time of its passing from one Sign to another which is a special time of glory, and above all when it enters Aries.\n\n---\n\n1 The phrase for \"summoned\" is da'wat far\u0101md. The T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukam\u0101 (Per. trs. 17b, foot) has \u016b \u1e25al\u0101'iq-i-rab'-mask\u016bn bahaft\u0101d \u016b du zab\u0101n da'wat num\u016bd \u016b 'ilm \u016b adab \u0101m\u014dkt. Mr. Rehateck remarks that 72 is a common number in Mu\u1e25ammadan theology, etc., and that David is spoken of as having 72 notes in his voice. Mas'\u016bd\u012b says (Meynard, 78) that after the Deluge, the 72 languages were divided as follows:\u2014 Shem 19, Ham 17, Japhet 36; total 72.\n\n2 The T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukam\u0101 has 108. (17b foot.) Ab\u016b'l-far\u0101j (Pococke) ed. 1663, p. 6 has 180.\n\n3 Text, Zoh\u0101, but there is a var. Roha which I adopt, for the city meant is probably Edessa, the Roha of the Arabs and the modern Orfa. It is in Asiatic Turkey, east of the Euphrates. (R\u00e9clus IX. 445 and Lectures on the Jewish Church, Stanley, 6.) If, however, A.F. means Edessa, there must be some mistake on his part, for Edessa was not, I believe, taken by Hul\u0101k\u016b Kh\u0101n and it certainly was not destroyed, for it still exists. See Quatrem\u00e8re's R\u0101gh\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn (334) for a note (128) on a Roha mentioned by R\u0101gh\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn as having been taken by Hul\u0101k\u016b Kh\u0101n. In the Persian it is spelt \u0631\u0648\u062d and Quatrem\u00e8re translates \"Houlagou en personne se dirigea vers Rouhah dont il se rendit ma\u00eetre.\" The note says \"J' ignore quelle est la ville que notre historien a voulu indiquer, et si le nom est correctement \u00e9crit.\" Possibly the town is Riha or Riah S.W. of Aleppo. (R\u00e9clus IX. 765 and 772 n.)\n\n4 A.F. here refers to the destruction of the Ismailians by Hul\u0101k\u016b, the grandson of Cingiz Kh\u0101n, in the middle of the 13th century. Cf. Gibbon's remark that the extirpation of the Assassins or Ismailians of Persia by Hul\u0101k\u016b may be considered a service to mankind.\n\n5 Lit. alighting of glory and renovation of felicity,\u2014nuz\u016bl-i-ijt\u0101l \u016b ta'wil-i-iqb\u0101l.\nAnd whenever the planets, who are fed from the bounteous table of its rays, entered their own Houses or attained their exaltation, he regarded them as of special dignity, and gave thanks for the wonders of creation. Such seasons he looked upon as stations and manifestations of the favour of God, and he spent all his days in the service of holy spirits and pure forms.\n\nHe also built the pyramids of Egypt which are known as the Domes of Haram\u0101n (Gumbaz-i-haram\u0101n). And in those lofty buildings, all the arts and their tools have been depicted, so that if the knowledge of them be lost, it may be recovered. It is recorded that he deputed one of his nobles to lay the foundations of these pyramids whilst he himself traversed the entire world, eventually returning to Egypt.\n\nAb\u016b Ma\u02beshar\u00b9 of Balkh relates that there have been many Hermes but that three were pre\u00ebminent;\u2014(1). Harmasi-har\u0101masa (Hermes of Hermeses) or Idr\u012bs whom the Persians call the grandson of Kay\u016bmarg.\u00b2 (2). Hermes of Babylon who built Babylon after the Deluge. Pythagoras was one of his disciples. By the exertions of this Hermes of Babylon, the sciences which had been lost in Noah\u2019s Flood were resuscitated. His home was in the city of the Chaldeans (Kal\u1e0d\u0101n\u012bn)\u00b3 which is called the city of the philosophers (wise men) of the East (Mad\u012bna-i-fil\u0101safa-i-mashriq). (3) The Hermes of Egypt who was the teacher of Esclapius (Asql\u012bnus).\u2074 He too excelled in all sciences, especially in medicine and chemistry and spent much time in travel.\n\nThe birth-place of Harmasu-l-har\u0101masa (Idr\u012bs) was Man\u012bf (Memphis) now known by the name of Man\u016bf,\u2075 in the land of Egypt. Before the founding of Alexandria, it was called the city of philo-\n\n\u00b9 (Jarrett II. 10. No. 43.) He was known in the Middle Ages as Al-bumaser. This passage closely resembles the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukam\u0101 (166-ft. ff.)\n\n\u00b2 This is H\u016bshang. (\u1e6cabar\u012b, Zotenburg, I. 100.)\n\n\u00b3 Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b, de Sa\u00e7y. Paris 1877, IX. 324 n. Their city was Kalw\u0101-dha.\n\n\u2074 The author of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukam\u0101 distinguishes between Esclapius, who he says is the son of \u0100m\u016br, and Asql\u012bnus.\n\n\u2075 Man\u016bf, but the \u0101 seems wrong; the \u0100in gives Manf or Minf. (Jarrett III. 75.) It is the Noph of the Bible. The Text here agrees closely with the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukam\u0101.\nsophers, but when Alexander built that city, he brought the sophers of Memphis and other places to Alexandria.\n\nAmong the sayings of Enoch is this, \"The three most excellent things are truth when angry, bounty when poor and mercy when strong.\" Wonderful stories are told in histories about his departure from this world, which wise men hesitate about accepting. One tradition is that he was then 365, another that he was 405 and third that he was 365.\n\nMethuselah.\n\nMethuselah was the son of Enoch. He had many children, so that it is difficult to enumerate them. After his father, he was the head of his tribe and called men to Divine worship. When he was 900, he had a son whom he called Lamech. After that he lived 290 years.\n\nLamech.\n\nLamech was the unique of his time for lofty character and exalted virtue. After his father, he became firmly seated on the throne. The period of his life was 780 years. And some call him Lamk\u0101n, L\u0101mak, and L\u0101makh.\n\nNoah (N\u016b\u1e25).\n\nNoah, the son of Lamech, was born under the Sign of Leo, 126 years after Adam's death. He was strong in the ways of religion and firmly based on the foundation of justice. The story of his calling mankind to the worship of God, the disobedience of his people and the event of the Flood, etc., are well-known.\n\nHistorians have mentioned three floods. First, a flood which\n\n---\n\n1 The \u0100in gives this name to Athens. (Jarrett III. 78.)\n2 This passage occurs in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukam\u0101. (Mir Khw\u0101nd, Rehatsek I. 72.) The first of these three things receives explanation from another remark of Enoch (Mir Khw\u0101nd, Rehatsek, II. Part I.) to the effect that a man should beware of uttering in the time of anger, words which will be a cause of disgrace to him. It may be noted here that Mir Khw\u0101nd's account of some of the patriarchs is to be found in two places,\u2014at the beginning of his work and again among the biographies of the philosophers.\n3 Koran, Sura 71. Noah is said to have invented the n\u0101q\u016bs = wooden gong.\noccurred before our Adam came into existence. Thus\u00b9 the very learned Shahraz\u016br\u012b says, \u201cAdam belongs to the first cycle which commenced after the world had been devastated by the first flood.\u201d The second flood was in the time of Noah and began at K\u00fcfa, in the oven\u00b2 of Noah\u2019s house. It lasted six months, and there were eighty persons in the Ark (k\u0101ghti). On this account the place where they disembarked and settled was called the Eighty-Market\u00b3 (S\u016bqu-\u1e63-gam\u0101nin). The third\u2074 flood was in the time of Moses and was confined to the Egyptians. Although romancing historians,\u2075 in treating of the floods, make the last two also extend over the whole world, it is evident that this was not so, for in India,\u2076 where they have books many thousand years old, there is not even a trace of these two floods. To be brief, in a short space of time, all the eighty occupants of the Ark died except seven, viz., Noah, his three sons, Japheth, Shem and Ham, and their wives. Noah assigned Syria, Mesopotamia, \u2018Ir\u0101q and Khurass\u0101n to Shem; the western countries, and Abyssinia, Indian, Scinde and the S\u016bd\u0101n\u2077\n\n\u00b9 This passage occurs in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-hukum\u0101 (Maq\u1e63\u016bd \u2018Al\u012b).\n\u00b2 This is the Mu\u1e25ammadan tradition. (\u1e6cabar\u012b, Zotenberg, I, 108 and Koran, Sale, Cap. XI). \u201cAnd the oven poured forth water, or, as the original literally signifies, boiled over, which is consonant to what the Rabbins say, that the water was boiling hot.\u201d (Rau\u1e93atu-s-sa\u1e63\u1e6da, Rehatek I, 90).\n\u00b3 Ar. S\u016bqu-\u1e63-gam\u0101nin. It was at the foot of the mountain Al J\u016bdi, i.e., Mount Ararat. (D\u2019Herbelot art. Thamanin). D\u2019H. states that it is called also Jaz\u012bra Bani \u2018Umar (in Mesopotamia). Mas\u02bfad\u012b says (Meynard, 74) that Al-J\u016bdi is in the country of Ba\u1e63ra and in Jaz\u012bra ibn \u2018Umar, that the eighty persons were 40 men and 40 women and that Sam\u0101nin existed in his day, 332 H.\n\u2074 Referring apparently to the hailstorm\u2014the seventh plague of Egypt, or perhaps to the overflowing of the Red Sea.\n\u2075 Shahraz\u016br\u012b describes Noah\u2019s Deluge as universal (17b).\n\u2076 It is curious that A.F. should assert there was no trace of Noah\u2019s Flood in the Indian annals for Satyavrata and his Flood have often been identified with Noah and the Deluge. Probably A.F. identified Satyavrata\u2019s Flood with that which occurred before the birth of Adam, for Satyavrata belongs to the beginning of the Satya Yuga and apparently A. F. assigned Noah\u2019s Flood to the commencement of the Kali Yuga and the beginning of the reign of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, for he gives 4696 years as the interval between these events and the 40th Akbar. (Jarrett II-15 and 22).\n\u2077 Or, \u201ccountry of the blacks.\u201d (Jarrett III, 108 and 109. Apparently A. F. includes the Arabs among the descendants of Ham.\nto Ham; and China, Sclavonia\u00b9 and Turkistan to Japheth. And in the opinion of historians, the aboriginal inhabitants of those countries at the present day, are descended from these three, and the lineage of mankind from the days of the Flood is derived from them. Noah died when he was either 1600 or 1300 years old. There are other stories too about his age, such as that he lived for 250 or 350 years after the Flood and that he was born either 126 years after Adam's death or in Adam's last days, and that he sat upon the throne of guidance, (i.e., became a prophet) when he was 50, or 150, or 250, or 350 years old, and that he was a guide to mortals for 950 years.\n\nHam\u00b2 had nine sons, viz., Hind, Sind, Zanj (Zanzibar), Nuba, Canaan, Kush, Qab\u1e6d (copt),\u00b3 Berber, Habsh (Abyssinia), and some have written that Ham had six sons. They omit Sind and Canaan and make Nuba the son of Habsh.\n\nShem also had nine sons, viz., (1) Arfakhshad,\u2074 (2) Kay\u016bmarq who is the progenitor of the kings of Persia, (3) As\u016bd\u2075 who founded Mad\u0101'in\u2076 (the twin-cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon), etc., Ahw\u0101z\u2077 and Pahl\u016b (? Peleg) are his sons and F\u0101rs is the son of Pahl\u016b, (4) Ighan\u2078 the father of Sh\u0101m (Syria) and R\u016bm (Asia Minor), (5) B\u016braj,\u2079 of whom historians tell nothing except the name, (6) L\u0101\u016bz (? Lud) from whom the Pharaohs of Egypt are descended, (7) Elam who built the cities of Khuzist\u0101n; Khur\u0101s\u0101n and Tamb\u0101l\u00b9\u2070 are his sons,\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 \u1e62aql\u0101b,\u2014the original Sclavonia, between the Oxus and the Dnieper, (Jarrett III, 104.) In the \u0100in (Text) \u1e62aql\u0101b is described as a city of R\u016bm which must be a mistake for R\u016bs. It seems that \u1e62aql\u0101b and Chalybes are the same word.\n\n\u00b2 Jarrett III, 327.

S. 1890.)\n\n\u2078 Var. Ifan and Iq\u012bn and (Hab\u012bbu-s-siyar) Iq\u0101n. Probably the last is correct for the name seems connected with Iconium (Koniah) and to be that of the eponymous hero of the city.\n\n\u2079 So too Hab\u012bbu-s-siyar but it calls him N\u0101raj.\n\n\u00b9\u2070 Tubal. Miles calls him Hakyal. Perhaps the same as T\u0101mel. (Jarrett II, 245 and 250.) Tambol appears as a person's name in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Rashidi and B\u0101bar's Me-\nand \u1e24ir\u0101q is the son of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and Kirm\u0101n (Carmania) and Makr\u0101n\\(^1\\) are sons of Tamb\u0101l, (8) Aram from whom the tribe of \u1e24\u0101d is descended, (9) B\u016bz\u0101r whose sons are \u0100zarb\u0101ij\u0101n, Ar\u0101n, Arman and Fargh\u0101n.\n\nSome say that Shem too had only six sons and omit Kay\u016bmarq, B\u016braj and L\u0101\u00fcz. In short, there is much discrepancy about the descendants of those two (Shem and Ham).\n\n**Japheth.** (Y\u0101fiq.)\n\nJapheth was the most just of Noah\u2019s sons. The lofty line of his Majesty, the king of kings, is linked with him, and the Kh\u0101ns of the eastern cities and of Turkist\u0101n all derive from him. He is called the Father of Turk (*Ab\u016b-l-turk*), and some historians call him Al\u016bnja Kh\u0101n. When Japheth left S\u016bqu-\u0161-\u0161am\u0101n\u012bn with his wife and family, to go to the eastern and northern countries which had been assigned to him, he begged his father to teach him a prayer by which he might have rain whenever he wanted it. Noah gave him a stone which had the property of bringing rain, and indicated that he had pronounced over it the Ineffable Name\\(^2\\) (*lit.* Great Name) with the design that the foolish should not comprehend the matter and transgress his precepts, or perhaps he really recited the Ineffable Name over it. And at present there are many of these stones among the Turks which they call *yedat\u0101\u0161k*. The Persians call them *sang-i-yada*\\(^3\\) and the Arabs *\u1e25ajaru-l-ma\u1e6dar*, (rain-stone). And Japheth, on\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) D\u2019Herbelot art. Macran.

Maulavi \u2018Abdu-l-haqq \u2018Abid, to whom I referred the passage, writes: \u201cThe meaning is not clear. There may be some misprint in the Text. As the passage stands, it may be translated, \u2018I have uttered over it the Great Name, in order that the simple, not getting clue to it, may not depart from his (your) command (or counsel), or he actually uttered the Great Name over it.\u201d The usual account is that Noah engraved the Great Name on the stone, and possibly we should read \u201cengraved,\u201d for \u201cuttered,\u201d in the last clause. A friend has referred me to the passage in Revelations II, 17, \u201cI will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth saying he that receiveth it.\u201d\n\n\\(^3\\) B\u0101bar, Erskine xlvi.

In course of time, children were born to Japheth and he established excellent laws among them, which were at once comforting to the short-thoughted and joy-increasing to lofty minds. He left eleven sons, viz., 1, Turk, 2, C\u012bn, 3, \u015eaql\u0101b, 4, Mansaj, also called Mansak, 5, Kam\u0101r\u012b, also called Kaim\u0101l, 6, Khalaj, 7, Khazan, 8, R\u016bs, 9, Sads\u0101n, 10, Ghaz, 11, Y\u0101raj. Some books mention only eight sons, omitting Khalaj, Sads\u0101n and Ghaz.\n\nTurk.\n\nTurk was the eldest son of Japheth, and the Turks call him Y\u0101fi\u011f \u00d6ghl\u0101n. He excelled all his brothers in wisdom, management and care for his subjects. On his father's death, he sat upon the throne of sovereignty and dispensed gentleness, manliness and relief of the oppressed. He settled in a place which the Turks call Sil-\u00fck or Salik\u0101i and which had hot and cold springs and delightful meadows. He made dwellings of grass and wood and constructed tents, and made clothes by sewing together the skins (and furs) of beasts of burden and of prey. Salt was discovered in his time. One of his laws was that the son should inherit naught but a sword and that whatever was wanted should go to the daughter. They say he was contemporary with Kay\u016bmarg, and that as the latter was the first king of Persia, so Turk was the first sultan of Turkist\u0101n. He lived to the age of 240.\n\n---\n\n1 The reputed father of Gog and Magog and, apparently, the Scriptural Mishegh.\n2 Gomer of Genesis. Probably the Text k is the MS g.\n3 Guz in Vullers II, 609a.

It lies N. of Yarkand. Its waters do not freeze. The Shajaratu-l-atr\u0101k calls it Jacelgan. (Miles 25).\n7 The discovery is said to have been made accidentally by his son T\u016bnag or T\u016btak.\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nALINJA KH\u00c2N.\n\nAlinja Kh\u00e2n was the best of Turk\u2019s sons. When the measure of Turk\u2019s years was fulfilled, Alinja Kh\u00e2n was placed on the throne by the will of the chiefs. He made far-sighted wisdom his rule, and spent his days in the administration of justice. When he became old, he went into retirement (i.e., became a hermit).\n\nDIB B\u0100Q\u016a\u012a.\n\nDib B\u0101q\u016b\u012b became king on his father\u2019s retirement and in accordance with his appointment.\n\nKIY\u016aK KH\u00c2N.\n\nKiy\u016bk was the worthy son of Dib B\u0101q\u016b\u012b. When the father bade adieu to the world, he made over the throne of the Kh\u00e2nate to Kiy\u016bk who, knowing the duties of sove eignty, acted up to them.\n\nALINJA KH\u00c2N.\n\nAlinja Kh\u00e2n was the son of Kiy\u016bk and became heir-apparent in the end of his father\u2019s days. He was extravagant in his liberalities, and in his reign the Turks became intoxicated by the world and strayed from the path of wisdom. After a long time, twin-sons were born to him. One was named Mughul and the other T\u00e2t\u0101r. When they came to years of discretion, he divided his kingdom into two portions and gave one half to Mughul and one half to T\u00e2t\u0101r. When their illustrious father died, each of the two sons reigned in his own territory, in harmony with one other.\n\nAs this lofty line (Akbar\u2019s) has no connection with T\u00e2t\u0101r and his eightfold branches (i.e., generations) I pass them over and proceed to relate the history of Mughul and his noble descendants.\n\nMUGHUL KH\u00c2N.\n\nMughul Kh\u00e2n was a wise prince. He so conducted himself that the hearts of his subjects were attached and obedient to him and\n\n---\n\n1 Shajratu-l-atr\u0101k, Abluchi Kh\u00e2n.\n2 D\u2019Herb\u00e8lot, \u201cGreat Dignity.\u201d\n3 This refers to their becoming idolaters. (Kh\u0101fi Kh\u00e2n I, 3).\n4 I.e., eight in all, T\u00e2t\u0101r being one.\n\n(Shajratu-l-atr\u0101k, Miles 29). According to D\u2019Herb\u00e8lot (Art. Tatar) Alinja Kh\u00e2n, the father, is required to make up the eight.\nall tried to serve him properly. The generations of the Mughuls are nine in number, beginning with Mughul Kh\u0101n and ending with Il Kh\u0101n. The Mughuls have taken the usage of Tuq\u0101z (nine) from this, and they consider this number most excellent in all matters. The Creator bestowed on Mughul Kh\u0101n four sons, Qar\u0101 Kh\u0101n, \u0100zar Kh\u0101n, Kar Kh\u0101n and \u00daz Kh\u0101n.\n\nQAR\u0100 KH\u0100N\n\nQar\u0101 Kh\u0101n was both the eldest son and pre\u00ebminent in justice and the art of government. He sat upon the throne in succession to his illustrious father and made his summer (ail\u0101q) and winter (qishl\u0101q) quarters in Qar\u0101q\u016bm near two mountains called Irt\u0101q and Kirt\u0101q.\n\n1 Vullers 481b. The generations are said to end with Il Kh\u0101n because, in his time, the Mughul race was all but extirpated. If the statement of the Turks, mentioned below, that this catastrophe occurred 1000 years after Agh\u016bz's death, be correct, it is evident that far more than nine generations must have intervened between Mughul and Il Kh\u0101n.\n\n2 Steingass s.v. \"Nine, hence present, gift, such being offered to kings, etc., by nines, as a sacred number.\"\n\n3 I.e., the Black Prince. A.F. omits to mention that he was put to death by his own son, Agh\u016bz. (Kh\u0101ft Kh\u0101n I, 5.)\n\n4 I.e., black sand or dust. The Text wrongly has \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0645 Qar\u0101qaram. The \u0100in mentions the place as belonging to the Sixth Climate. (Jarrett III, 102). The \u0100in (Text II, 46), describes it as a mountain in Turkist\u0101n (not Kohist\u0101n as Jarrett has it) and the editor says (l.c.n.) that many MSS. read \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0645 Qar\u0101q\u016bm. This is the correct reading. (Vul-\n\nlers s.v. II, 717b, and D'Herb\u00e9lot art: Caracum.) In Gladwin's \u0100in the lat. and long. of Qar\u0101q\u016bm and of Kh\u0101nb\u0101l\u012bgh which immediately follows, are given; the long. for Qar\u0101q\u016bm being 115\u00b0 and for Kh\u0101nb\u0101l\u012bgh 124\u00b0.\n\nN.B. Kh\u0101nb\u0101l\u012bgh is described in Text as the capital of Cathay, not of China.\n\n5 Erdmann, \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0642 \u0648 \u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u062a\u0627\u0642 Urt\u0101q and Gazt\u0101q. D'Herb\u00e9lot calls them Artak and Ghertak, and says they are part of Mount Imaus (Paradise Lost III, 431), and that the city of Caracum lies between them, Artak being N. and Ghertak S. He gives the long. as 116\u00b0 which agrees very well with Gladwin. Of course both longs. are calculated from the Fortunate Isles. Greenwich long. is between 72\u00b0 and 80\u00b0. The lat. of the Karakoram Pass (Imperial Gazeteer, Hunter), is 35\u00b0 33' or about 11\u00b0 less than that given in the \u0100in. (46 N.). This would imply that Qar\u0101q\u016bm and Qar\u0101qaram are totally different names and places.\nAgh\u00fcz Kh\u00e2n was the worthy son of Qar\u0101 Kh\u00e2n, and was born of his chief wife during the time of his rule. Romancing storytellers relate things about his naming himself and about his progress in the path of piety, which a just-judging intellect is not disposed to credit. He was admittedly an enlightened, pious and just ruler and framed excellent institutions* and laws whereby the varied world was composed and the contrarieties of the Age conciliated. Among Turki kings, he was like Jamshid among the kings of Persia. By his ripe wisdom, lofty genius, felicity and native courage, he brought under his sway the countries of Ir\u0101n (Persia) T\u016br\u0101n,* R\u016bm* (Asia Minor), Egypt, Syria, Europe (Afranj),5 and other lands. Many nations came within the shadow of his benevolence, and he established titles among the Turks suitable to their ranks and which\n\nbut on the other hand, D'Herb\u00e8lot gives the lat. of Caracum as 36\u00b0 36\u2032. There is an account of the city of Karacum (Caracorum) in Gibbon who (Cap. 64) makes it about 600 m. N.W. Pekin. It was also called Holin.\n\n1 Text, Agh\u016br. For account of him see Kh\u0101fi Kh\u00e2n I, 4 and 5, D'Herb\u00e8lot s.v. Ogouz Kh\u00e2n, Shaj-ratu-l-atr\u0101k (Miles) 30. The story is that Agh\u00fcz refused immediately after birth to take the breast, and that his mother had a dream in which he told her that he would not permit her to suckle him until she became a believer in Isl\u0101m. Accordingly she secretly embraced that faith. Also, when he was a twelve-month old, he told the conclave assembled to decide upon his name, that it was Aghuz (Kh\u0101fi Kh\u00e2n l.c.). These things occurred long before the birth of Mu\u1e25ammad, but the latter was only the Seal (last) of the Pro-\n\nphets, and the religion of Isl\u0101m is considered to have existed from all time. Hence the Mu. formula of \"Peace be upon him\" is applied to Adam and others of the patriarchs.\n\n2 L\u0101l y\u0101s\u0101. Text, b\u0101yi\u0161tah\u0101t which is an error. The best known y\u0101s\u0101 are those of Cingiz Kh\u00e2n. (Miles l.c. 90 and Gibbon and D'Herb\u00e8lot art. Jassa).\n\n3 Turkist\u0101n or Transoxiana. It is said to have been named after T\u016br, the son of Far\u012bd\u016bn (D'H. art. Mogal), but if so, A.F.'s use of it here is an anachronism, for he describes T\u016br as nearly exterminating the Mughuls about a thousand years after Agh\u00fcz Kh\u00e2n's death.\n\n4 This may mean the whole Greek Empire or only Asia Minor (Roumelia).\n\n5 Afranj is properly the name of a people, viz., the Franks. Rauzatu-s-q\u016bf\u0101, V, gives a similar list.\nare on men's tongues to the present day, such as Aigh\u00fbr, Qanigh\u00eeli, Qibc\u00e2q, (Kipc\u00e2k), Q\u00e2rl\u00eegh, Khalaj, etc. He had six sons, viz., K\u00fbn (sun), \u00c2i (moon), Y\u00fblduz (star), K\u00f4k (or G\u00f4k) (sky), T\u00e2gh (mountain), and Tang\u00eez (sea). The three elders were called Buzmaq and the three others Uj\u00fbk. His sons and sons' sons became 24 branches, and all the Turks are descended from these magnates. The term Turkom\u00e2n did not exist in old times, but when their posterity came to Persia (\u00cer\u00e2n) and propagated there, their features came to resemble the T\u00e2j\u00eeks. But as they were not T\u00e2j\u00eeks, the latter called them Turkom\u00e2ns, i.e., Turk-like. But some say that the Turkom\u00e2ns are a distinct tribe and not related to the Turks. It is said that after Agh\u00fbz Kh\u00e2n had conquered the world, he returned to his own settlement (y\u00fbrat), and seating himself on the throne of dominion, held a Khusr\u00fb-like feast and conferred royal gifts on each of his fortunate sons, faithful officers and other servants, and promulgated lofty ordinances and excellent canons as guides for the perpetuation of prosperity. He laid it down that the right wing, which Turkom\u00e2ns call Bur\u00e2ngh\u00e2r, and the succession should appertain to the eldest son and his descendants, and the left wing, i.e., the Jar\u00e2ngh\u00e2r and the executive (wak\u00e2lat) to the younger sons. And he decreed that this law should always be observed, generation after generation;\u2014hence at the present day, one half of the twenty-four branches is associated with the right wing and one half with the left. He ruled for 72 or 73 years and then bade adieu to the world.\n\nKun Kh\u00e2n.\n\nKun Kh\u00e2n took his father's place, in accordance with his testament and acted in administration and government by his own acute\n\n---\n\n1 The meanings of this and following terms are given by Mr Khw\u00e2nd and Miles. Erdmann, the authority often quoted by Howorth, writes \u0642\u0627\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0643 q\u00e2rl\u00fbk, and says it means snow-lord. Qipc\u00e2k is said to mean a hollow tree.\n\n2 Said to mean \"Broken\" and \"Three arrows.\" The legend of origin is given by Miles. Text, B\u00e2juq for Uj\u00fbq. Uq is an arrow, and uq means three. The etymologies are also given in Ab\u00fb-l-gh\u00e2s\u00ee Des Maison 24. The name Buzmaq or \"Broken\" was given to the three elder sons because they brought in three pieces of a golden bow. The three younger brought in three golden arrows.\nunderstanding, and the sage counsels of Qabal Khw\u0101ja who had been Vizier to Agh\u016bz Kh\u0101n. He so arranged about his brothers, his children and his nephews\u2014who were 24 in number, for each of the six brothers had four sons\u2014that each recognized his position and assisted in the management of the State. Having reigned for 70 years, he appointed \u0100\u012b Kh\u0101n his successor and departed.\n\n\u0100\u012b Kh\u0101n.\n\n\u0100\u012b Kh\u0101n observed the laws of his illustrious father, adorned justice with amicability, and combined wisdom with good actions.\n\nYuld\u016bz Kh\u0101n.\n\nYuld\u016bz Kh\u0101n was the eldest son and successor of \u0100\u012b Kh\u0101n. He attained high rank in world-sway and in the dispensing justice.\n\nMangali Kh\u0101n (Michael).\n\nMangali Kh\u0101n was the beloved son of Yuld\u016bz Kh\u0101n and sat upon the throne in succession to him. He was distinguished for devotion to God, and for praising the pious.\n\nTangiz Kh\u0101n.\n\nTangiz Kh\u0101n conducted the affairs of sovereignty after his honoured father's death and wore the crown of dominion in Mughulist\u0101n for 110 years.\n\n\u012al Kh\u0101n.\n\n\u012al Kh\u0101n was his noble son. When the father became old and weak, he gave \u012al Kh\u0101n the management of affairs, and alleging the number of his years as an excuse, went into solitary retirement.\n\nQiy\u0101n.\n\nQiy\u0101n was the son of \u012al Kh\u0101n and, by the mysterious ordinances of Divine wisdom, he became a resting-place (maurid) of adversities.\n\n---\n\n1 The conjunction \u0101 has dropped out of the Text, but occurs in the Lucknow ed. and in No. 564.\n2 Text, Irqil, but admittedly this is against all the MSS.\n3 Apparently he is Kun's brother, and the \"illustrious father\" must be Agh\u016bz.\n4 According to another account, he was \u0100\u012b Kh\u0101n's brother.\n5 Mangala may also mean sun, or the forehead, (Tar. Rash 7n.)\n6 Though this name is the heading of the Text, the narrative is in part that of \u012al Kh\u0101n's reign.\nWhen the God of wisdom desires to bring a jewel of humanity to perfection, He first manifests sundry favours under the cover of disfavours of misfortune, and grants him the robe of existence after having made some great and pure-hearted ones his ransom and sacrifice (fid\u0101). There is an instance of this in the story of \u012al Kh\u0101n who, after the turn of sovereignty came to him, was passing his life according to a code which provided for the control of the outer world and the contemplation of the world of reality, and was binding up the hearts of the distressed, until that T\u016br, the son of Far\u012bd\u016bn, obtained sway over Turkist\u0101n, and Transoxiana (M\u0101-w\u0101r\u0101u n-nahr) and in conjunction with Sunij Kh\u0101n, the king of the T\u0101t\u0101rs and Aigh\u016brs, made a great war upon \u012al Kh\u0101n. The Mughul army, under the excellent dispositions of \u012al Kh\u0101n, made a desperate struggle, and many of the Turks, T\u0101t\u0101rs and Aigh\u016brs were slain. In the combat, T\u016br and the T\u0101t\u0101rs were unable to resist and fled. They took refuge in stratagems and vulpine tricks and dispersed. After going a little way, they hid in a defile, and then at the end of the night, suddenly made an onslaught on \u012al Kh\u0101n\u2019s army. Such a massacre took place that of \u012al Kh\u0101n\u2019s men not one escaped except his son Qiy\u0101n, his cousin Tak\u016bz and their two wives who had hidden themselves among the slain. At night, these four withdrew to the mountains and with many troubles and difficulties, traversed the valleys and ravines, and came to a meadow which had salubrious springs and fruits in abundance. In their helpless state, they regarded this pleasant spot as a godsend and settled in it. The Turks call it Irganaq\u016bn and say that the terrible calamity happened 1000 years after the death of Agh\u016bz Kh\u0101n.\n\nThe sage knows that in this wondrous destiny there lay the plan for the production of that all-jewel, his Majesty, the king of kings, so that the status of sacrifice might be attained and also that the ascents of banishment, seclusion, and hardship might, in this strange fashion, be brought together to the end that the unique pearl,\n\n---\n\n1 There is perhaps a play on the words mir\u0101d and mur\u0101d; the first meaning a precious stone possessed of wondrous qualities, the second success.\n\n2 Probably Naq\u016bz is more correct.\n\n3 The Text does not distinctly say that the women were wives, the word used being haram. One account says sisters.\nhis Majesty, the king of kings,\u2014who is the final cause of the creation of the glorious series (tabaqa) and also the material for this record of Divine praise,\u2014might become the aggregate of all the stages of existence and be acquainted with the grades of humanity, which might thus arise,\u2014and should achieve spiritual and temporal success, and that in this way there be no defective round (girdi) on the periphery of his holiness.\n\nIn fine, after Qiy\u0101n and his companions had settled in that place, they begat children and grew into tribes. Those who sprang from Qiy\u0101n were called Qiy\u0101t and those who descended from Tak\u016bz were called Darlg\u012bn. No account is forthcoming of the descendants of Qiy\u0101n while they were in Irganaq\u016bn\u2014a period of about 2,000 years. Presumably in that place and age reading and writing were not practised. After the lapse of about 2000 years and in the last period of N\u016bsh\u012brw\u0101n's reign, the Qiy\u0101t and Darlg\u012bn desired to leave the place, as it was not large enough for them. A mountain which was a mine of iron barred their way at the beginning. Able minds devised deer-skin bellows (gawazn, perhaps elk) and with these they melted that iron mountain and made a way. Then they rescued their country from the hands of the T\u0101t\u0101rs and others, by the sword, and contriving vigour, and became firmly seated on the throne of success and world-rule. From the circumstance that in four thousand years previous to this event, (i.e., the emigration from Irganaq\u016bn) there\n\n---\n\n1 N\u016bsh\u012brw\u0101n, a king of Persia, celebrated for his justice, reigned 531-579 A.D. Mu\u1e25ammad congratulated himself on having been born (578 A.D.) in his reign.\n\n2 I do not understand the principle of this calculation. Yuld\u016bz Kh\u0101n, under whom the Mughuls emigrated from Irganaq\u016bn, is the 29th ancestor, reckoning from Adam, and the total of 28 must be made up of 25 who lived previous to the flight to Irganaq\u016bn plus three, vis., Qiy\u0101n, Tim\u016br T\u0101sh and Mangal\u012b, who are the only three denizens of that settlement whose names have been preserved. The period after the exodus (cir. 579 A.D.) up to the date of A.F.'s writing, was about 1,000 years, and in it there were 25 rulers including Akbar. But how do calculators reckon, upon these data, that the number of ancestors who lived in Irganaq\u016bn for 2,000 years, was 25? One would rather expect the figure 50. But perhaps the calculation is based on lives twice as long as later ones. (Gibbon Cap. 42n.) Apparently it is roughly based on a progressive diminution of the period of human life. A.F. reckons that 7,000 years more or less,\nwere twenty-eight lofty ancestors and twenty-five in the millennium after it, sagacious calculators conjecture that during these two thousand years (spent in Irganaqun) there were twenty-five ancestors.\n\nBe it remembered that Mughulist\u0101n is to the eastward and far from civilization. Its circuit is seven or eight months' journey. On the east, its boundary extends to Cathay (Khit\u0101) and on the west, to the country of the Aigh\u016brs; on the north, it touches Qargaz and Salik\u0101 (? Kirghiz and Selenga) and on the south, it adjoins Tibet. The food of its people is the produce of hunting and fishing and their clothing the skins and fur of wild and tame animals.\n\nTimur T\u0101sh.\n\nTimur T\u0101sh is of the auspicious stock of Qiy\u0101n. He was exalted by sovereignty and command.\n\nelapsed from the birth of Adam to 40th Akbar (1596). From Adam to the death of Il Kh\u0101n, 4,000 years are counted, and in this period, were 25 generations. (A.F. speaks of 28, but this is inclusive of Il Kh\u0101n's son, Qiy\u0101n and Timur T\u0101sh and Mangal\u012b Khw\u0101ja, vis., the grandfather and father of the Yuld\u016bz who came out from Irganaqun). In the thousand years between the emigration and 40th Akbar, there were also 25 generations, and so, apparently, it was calculated that for the intervening 2,000 years (required to make up the 7,000) there must have been 25 generations. In other words, there were 4,000 years in which the length of a generation was 160 years, 2,000 in which it was 80 and 1,000 in which it was 40. I do not, however, know what authority A.F. had for his 2,000 years. \"The tradition of the Mughuls,\" says Gibbon (Cap. 42n.) \"of the 450 years which they passed in the mountains, agrees with the Chinese periods of the History of the Huns and Turks.\" (De Gignes \"Tom. I, Par. II, 376), and of the 20 generations from their restoration to Gingis.\" (Cingiz Kh\u0101n). Howorth (I, 35) puts the period at 400 years. Rash\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn mentions a period of 2,000 years, but this is the interval from the destruction of Il Kh\u0101n and the Mughuls by the T\u0101t\u0101rs up to the date of Rash\u012bdu-d-din's writing, consequently the former event occurred about 700 B.C. D'Ohsson says (I, Cap. II, 21) that according to Mughul traditions, their defeat by the T\u0101t\u0101rs occurred 2,000 years before the birth of Cingiz Kh\u0101n. (Jan. 1155 A.D.) D'Herbelot (art. Genghis Kh\u0101n) says that the Mughuls remained in Irganaqun for several generations, and that the period was over 1,000 years. None of these statements supports A.F.'s chronology. Possibly he wrote one and not two thousand.\n\n1 This description is taken from Zufarn\u0101ma, Prolegomena.\nMANGALI KHWAJA.\n\nMangali Khwaja is the worthy son of Timur Tash. He exalted the crown of dominion and auspiciousness and possessed the divan of power and justice.\n\nYULDUZ KHAN.\n\nYuld\u00fcz Khan was the high-thoughted successor of Mangali Khwaja who at the coming out of the Qiyat and Darligin was the chief and leader. From the time of Qiy\u0101n, his (Qiy\u0101n\u2019s) descendants had reigned generation after generation in Irganaq\u016bn. Yuld\u00fcz Khan, by the help of the fortunate star of his dominion, gradually emerged from the horizon and civilized the tribes of the Mughuls. He was powerful and magnanimous and among the Mughul families, he is counted of good blood and fashion who can trace his origin up to Yuld\u00fcz Khan.\n\nJUINA1 BAHADUR.\n\nJuina Bahadur was the worthy son of Yuld\u00fcz Khan and when the cup of his father\u2019s years was full, sate on the throne of world-government.\n\n1 Also spelled J\u0101b\u012bna and C\u0101b\u012bna. For further information regarding the Muhammadan accounts of the descendants of Japheth, I beg to refer the reader to the full and interesting note of Major Raverty which begins at p. 869 of his translation of the Tabaq\u0101t-i-n\u0101siri.\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nHer Majesty Alanquwl, the Cupola of Chastity and Veil of Purity.\n\nWhatever, God, the wondrous Creator, brings forth from the hidden places of secrecy to the light of manifestation, is attended by extraordinary circumstances. But the sons of men fail to perceive these, from the heedlessness which has its props and foundation in fulness of life and the wrappings of worldliness. Were it not so, man would be ever standing at gaze and not applying himself to action. Hence the world-adorning Initiator hides most of the wonders of His power from the sight of mortals, but lest they should be entirely shut out from the extraordinary spectacle of the Divine decrees, He raises this veil from before a few of the holy hiding places of His secrets. And again, after much seeing, a heedlessness which fate has made a constituent of their natures, causes this very sight to become a screen against perception. And again after that, the universal benevolence of the Deity, for a thousand diverse purposes\u2014one being the instruction of the minds of negligent mortals,\u2014brings forth a new creation, and raising the veils and curtains somewhat, displays a wondrous picture.\n\nThe extraordinary story of her Majesty is a case in point. She was the happy-starred daughter (dukhtar-i-qudsi-akhtar) of J\u016b\u012bna Bah\u0101dur of the Qiy\u0101t tribe and Barl\u0101s family. Her physical and\n\n1 The passage is obscure, but I think the sense is that men get accustomed to the wonderful and so their very seeing becomes blindness. The B.M. No. 5610 (Halhed's) omits the as after bisy\u0101r, thus making ghaflat\u012b (heedlessness) the nominative. I have adopted this reading as I think it makes the better sense.\n\n2 Kh\u0101ft Kh\u0101n Bib. Ind. I, 7n. According to one copy of the Zafarn\u0101ma\u2014Prolegomena, J\u0101b\u012bna was a woman and a daughter of Yuld\u016bz Kh\u0101n.\n\n3 Erdmann says she belonged to the tribe of Q\u016brulas \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0633. See also T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-magh\u012bdi, Ney Elias and Ross 51, where the author states that she\nmental beauty went on increasing from her earliest years, until by loftiness of thought and sublimity of genius, she became the Unique of the Age, and by acknowledgment of friends and foes, relatives and strangers, was magnanimous, pious, and a lover of wisdom. The lights of theosophy shone from her countenance, the Divine secrets were manifested on her forehead. She sat secluded behind the screen of chastity and abode in the privy chamber of meditation on the Unity, was a theatre of holy epiphanies and an alighting-stage of Divine emanations. When she arrived at maturity, she was, according to the custom of princes and the practice of great ones of Church and State, given in marriage to Z\u016bb\u016bn Biy\u0101n, king of Mughulist\u0101n and her own cousin and (thus) they joined that unique pearl of purity with a temporal ruler. As he was not her match, he hastened to annihilation and her Majesty \u0100lanquw\u0101 who was the repose (\u0101s\u0101yi\u0161) of the spiritual world, became likewise the ornament (\u0101r\u0101yi\u0161) of the temporal world and, applying herself of necessity to outward acts, she became the sovereign of her tribe (al\u0101s).\n\nOne night this divinely radiant one was reposing on her bed, when suddenly a glorious light cast a ray into the tent and entered the mouth and throat of that fount of spiritual knowledge and glory. The cupola of chastity became pregnant by that light in the same way as did her Majesty (\u1e24azrat) Miryam (Mary) the daughter of \u2018Imr\u0101n (Amram).\n\nPraised be the God who maintained holy human souls from Adam down to this child of light, in prosperity and adversity, abundance and want, victory and defeat, pleasure and pain, and other contrasted conditions, one after another, and made them partakers of emanations of the holy light. Before this holy light made its fortunate alighting from high heaven, Qiy\u0101n was withdrawn from the associations of climates and cities and supported in a solitary wilderness, and many ancestors were given to her (\u0100lanquw\u0101), generation after\n\nwas a Kurkluk (?). In B.M. No. 7628 of R\u0101gh\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn\u2019s great work, 45th, the name of the tribe is written \u0642\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0633 Q\u016br\u0101las. Barl\u0101s then must be a copyist\u2019s error.\n\n1 Cf. Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n I, 8. He says the light was like the sun\u2019s disk, and that it entered \u0100lanquw\u0101\u2019s mouth which was open (from astonishment apparently, at the spectacle).\n\n2 The Virgin Mary whom Mu\u1e25ammad calls the daughter of \u2018Amr\u0101n, apparently because he confounded her with the sister of Moses.\ngeneration, for two thousand years in these Highlands (kohist\u0101n), thereby purifying her and familiarizing her with the land of holiness and converting the human element into a collection of all degrees, Divine and earthly. When the spiritual preparation was complete, Yuld\u016bz Kh\u0101n was brought\u2014for the ends of Divine wisdom\u2014from the mountains to the city, and seated on a throne, till the turn of the holy series reached her Majesty \u0100lanquw\u0101 and that divine light, after passing without human instrumentality, through many eminent saints and sovereigns, displayed itself gloriously in the external world. That day\u00b9 (viz., of \u0100lanquw\u0101\u2019s conception) was the beginning of the manifestation of his Majesty, the king of kings, who after passing through divers stages was revealed to the world from the holy womb of her Majesty Miryam-mak\u0101n\u012b for the accomplishment of things visible and invisible.\n\nIt needs a Plato of abstract thought to comprehend the saying \u201cThe Lord\u00b2 of Time (zam\u0101n) remains behind the veil whilst Time\u2019s products (zam\u0101niy\u0101n), i.e., mortals, rend it with outward sorrow and inward anguish.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 I should have been inclined to read n\u016br, light here, instead of r\u014dz, day, but all the MSS. seem to have r\u014dz.\n\n\u00b2 I do not fully understand this passage. It seems to be a quotation, a sort of Sybiline utterance, and is naturally dark, since we are told that it needs the utmost meditation of a Plato to understand it. The Lucknow editor says the meaning is that a master of wisdom should study with might and main how the veil may be rent for suffering humanity, but I do not see that this sense can be got out of the words. The translation which I have given is the result of a good deal of reflection and of a consultation with my friend Mr. Beames. Mr. Beames has given me the following note. \u201cThough the construction of the sentence is somewhat harsh and irregular, yet the general meaning of the passage seems clear from the context.\u201d \u201cA.F. starts (Lucknow ed. 52 1, 2) by the amazing assertion that the beginning of the manifestation of Akbar, dated from the day of \u0100lanquw\u0101\u2019s miraculous conception by the Sun and continued through many generations till he ultimately saw the light from the womb of Miryam-mak\u0101n\u012b.\u201d\n\nThen it evidently occurs to him that this is rather a hard saying and that some one might object. \u201cHow could Akbar be conceived in the womb of \u0100lanquw\u0101, seeing that she lived so many centuries before him?\u201d To this he replies that only a sage who devotes himself to profound thought and medi-\nBut now returning to the beginning of the story, I repeat that the holy abode of that cupola of chastity was continually at auspicious times and seasons, made resplendent by the brilliance of that\n\n\"tation can understand this mystical\n\"saying, viz., that while ordinary\n\"mortals rend the veil (parda-dar),\n\"i.e., are born, in due course, Akbar\n\"was miraculously held back from\n\"being born, he remained behind\n\"the veil or, in courtier-like phrase,\n\"adorning the veil (parda-\u0101r\u0101t)\u2014for\n\"many ages till his full time arrived.\n\"The passage may therefore be\n\"translated as follows:\u2014\n\n\"It requires a Plato of deep medi-\n\"tation to accept this statement\n\"with the ear of his understanding,\n\"that the Prince of the Age is in\n\"the condition of adorning the veil,\n\"while (ordinary) mortals rend the\n\"veil with visible pain and inward\n\"groaning.\"\n\n\"The grammatical awkwardness\n\"lies in A.F.'s putting ast after\n\"parda-dar instead of and (they are)\n\"which would agree better with the\n\"plural subject sam\u0101niy\u0101n; and in\n\"leaving out ast after \u0101r\u0101i. But\n\"this kind of construction is not\n\"unusual. The substitution of the\n\"uncouth phrase dar pard\u0101-\u0101r\u0101t 'in\n\"veil adorning-ness' for the simpler\n\"parda-\u0101r\u0101t, 'veil adorning' is per-\n\"haps due to a desire to play upon\n\"the two meanings of dar (1), in\n\"and (2) tearing; contrasting the\n\"lot of Akbar who remained for\n\"some generations miraculously re-\n\"served behind the veil, i.e., in the\n\"womb of successive females, with\n\"the lot of ordinary mortals who\n\"when they are conceived and de-\n\"veloped, rend the veil, i.e., are born;\n\n\"a contrast which, as he justly\n\"observes, it takes a Plato, at least,\n\"to grasp.\"\n\nI have adopted Mr. Beames' note\nwith some modifications. My idea is\nthat A.F. means to say it is so extra-\nordinary that the Lord of Time or\nPrince of the Age should remain\nbehind the veil (i.e., continue unborn),\nwhile wretched mortals come into\nexistence to their own loss as well as\nto the detriment of the epoch, that\nonly a Plato can comprehend the\nmystery or final cause thereof.\nPerhaps A.F.'s thought is illustrated\nby the words of St. Paul, \"For we\nknow the whole Creation groaneth\nand travaileth in pain together until\nnow.\" See also Cap. XI where A.F.\nspeaks of Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b, a poet of a for-\nmer age, vainly longing for the\nappearance of a S\u0101hib-i-waqt, a Lord\nof the Age or Time.\n\nI think too that he, as usual, has a\ndouble meaning, and that he plays\nupon the double sense of pard\u0101-dar\nwhich means both to rend a veil and\nto be dissolute, thus corresponding to\nthe double meaning of the Latin\nprofanus. I have consulted a num-\nber of MSS. for variants but without\nsuccess. Several e.g., I, O. 564 and\nAdd. B.M. No. 4944 have pard\u0101-\nd\u014dst, veil-loving (? loving blindness).\nBut this seems no improvement.\nParda-dar is probably right as ena-\nbling A.F. to take advantage of the\ntwo words dar fr. darid\u0101n, to tear,\nand dar, within, and to contrast dar\nparda-\u0101r\u0101t with pard\u0101-dar.\nlight and from time to time, her moral and material nature brightened by its effulgence. Those who by a soaring flight on the wings of genius, have passed beyond the worship of materiality and can behold the Causer, do not think occurrences like this strange or wonderful in the wide domain of Divine power, and the incredulity of worshippers of routine and superficiality is of no weight in their esteem. As for those who have remained among secondary causes and have not advanced their foot further and cannot, by auspicious guidance, forego superficial computations, they too do not abide by their first principles, (i.e., are not consistent). For instance they admit there was a child without father or mother, viz., the first man or Adam, and they accept a child without a mother, whom they call Eve. Why then not admit a child without a father? Especially when they are fully assured of such an occurrence in the case of Jesus and Mary.\n\nVerse.\n\nIf you listen to the tale of Mary,\nBelieve the same of \u0100lanqu\u0101.\n\nBut the world-fashioning Creator who from their inception brings all his works to their final accomplishment, effects His purposes by means of the contradictions and oppositions of His beautiful and His terrible Attributes (asm\u0101, lit. names). Accordingly there is a section of mankind of lofty intelligence, right judgment, exalted thought, sublime power and correct thinking, whom He hath placed apart and whose condition He advances day by day. So also there is a multitude of human shapes, purblind, feeble of apprehension, crooked in thought and of evil imaginations, void of usefulness, whom He hath marked out and whom He keeps in a state of perturbation. And although the cup of His designs may be filled in either of these ways, yet there are many contrivances involved in the combination. Accordingly darkness is united with light, bad fortune with good, adversity with prosperity and the wicked and black-hearted are always putting forward stones of stumbling. But soon they are disgraced spiritually and temporarily and depart to the street of annihilation.\n\nThis brilliant event is an illustration of the above, for when such a wondrous thing occurred, evil thoughts arose in the hearts of the\nshort-sighted dullards and worshippers of externals who had no share in real merit and were alien from the grace of Divine knowledge. That enthroned vestal (\u0100lanquw\u0101), out of her perfect benevolence, did not desire that these blind wretches should remain caught in the slough of this thought and so apprized her nobles of the matter. She intimated that \"if any dullard or simpleton, unaware of the wondrous power of God and the forms of Divine decrees, fall into the misfortune of evil thoughts and sully his mind's mirror with the rust of wicked imagination, he will for ever and ever abide in distress and loss. It is better then that I clear the courts of their intellect of such confusion. For this purpose, it is necessary that awakened-hearted truth-knowers and trusty persons of sincerity watch by night around the tent, so that the darkness of suspicion and doubt caused by the blackness of their hearts may by the light of Divine events and the beholding of hidden radiances, be changed into illumination and that evil thoughts may pass from their turbid minds.\"\n\nAccordingly several wakeful and prudent, keen-sighted watchers were placed around the tent and like night-burning stars, they closed not their eyes. Suddenly in the middle of the night,\u2014which is the time for the descent of Divine mercies,\u2014a shining light, like bright moonlight,\u2014just as the lady, the curtain of chastity, had said,\u2014came down from on high and entered the tent. A cry was raised by the watchers. For a little while, people were stunned and then their vain thoughts and evil imaginations were exorcised.\n\nWhen the period of pregnancy was fulfilled, \u0100lanquw\u0101 bore three noble sons. The first was B\u016bq\u016bn Qanq\u012b from whom the Qanq\u012bn tribe is descended; the second was Y\u016bsuq\u012b S\u0101lji from whom the S\u0101lj\u016bts are sprung. The third was B\u016bzanjar Q\u0101\u0101n. The descendants of these nobly-born ones are called Nair\u016bn, i.e., light-produced and are considered to be the noblest class among the Mughuls.\n\nB\u016bzanjar Q\u0101\u0101n.\n\nB\u016bzanjar Q\u0101\u0101n is the ninth ancestor of Cingiz Kh\u0101n and Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n, the fourteenth of his Majesty, the Lord of Conjunction, and the twenty-second1 of his Majesty, the king of kings. When he came to years of discretion, he adorned the sovereignty of Tur\u0101n,\n\n---\n\n1 So Text, but apparently it should be twenty-first.\nand the chiefs of the T\u0101t\u0101r and Turk tribes, etc., who were like satraps (Mul\u016bk-i-gaw\u0101'if, i.e., the Arsacid\u00e6) bound the girdle of service on their waists. He composed the distractions of the time by the vigour of his administration, distributed justice and benevolence and, for a prolonged period, soothed and adorned the world by his nobility and wisdom. He was contemporary with Ab\u016b Muslim Marw\u0101z\u012b. When his existence closed, there remained two sons, B\u016bq\u0101 and T\u016bq\u0101b\u0101 (? T\u016bq\u0101).\n\nB\u016bq\u0101 Kh\u0101n.\n\nB\u016bq\u0101 Kh\u0101n was the eldest son of B\u016bzanjar Q\u0101\u0101n and the eighth ancestor of Cingiz Kh\u0101n and Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n. He ascended the throne in accordance with his father's testament and adorned the royal div\u0101n by justice and equity. He devised new regulations for world-ruling and world-subduing and framed the code of the Kh\u0101q\u0101ns of the world. He so carried himself towards his subjects that one and all were rendered happy by him.\n\nD\u016btam\u012bn Kh\u0101n.\n\nZ\u016btam\u012bn Kh\u0101n was the upright son of B\u016bq\u0101 Kh\u0101n. When the father perceived his own life passing away, he appointed him his heir and successor. Z\u016btam\u012bn exerted himself in controlling the administration and in increasing the prosperity of the kingdom. He had nine sons, and on his death, their mother Man\u016bl\u016bn who was unique in wisdom and management, went into retirement and devoted herself to their upbringing. One day, the Jal\u0101sirs who belong to the Darlg\u012bn tribe, laid an ambush and killed Man\u016bl\u016bn and eight of her sons. Q\u0101id\u016b Kh\u0101n, the ninth son, had gone off to China (M\u0101c\u012bn) in order to become his cousin's son-in-law and so escaped. With the\n\n1 Ab\u016b Muslim 'Abdu-r-rahm\u0101n, son of Muhammad and called the missionary of the 'Abbasides, i.e., S\u0101hib-i-da'wat or author of the call of the 'Abbasides, (Gibbon cap. 52,) and also called \u1e24\u0101j Jary\u0101n. He was a general of the 'Abbasides and the origin of their power but was put to death 136 H. 753 by Khal\u012bf Man\u1e63\u016br. (Mas'\u016bd\u012b, Moynard. VI, 58, 176, etc.) Merv was one of the four chief cities of Khur\u0101s\u0101n and its inhabitants were called Marw\u0101z\u012b. (D'Herb\u00e9lot art. Merou.)\n\n2 The Text follows the MSS. which spell the name in two ways.\n\n3 The Shajratu-l-atr\u0101k has a long story as to the cause of these murders.\n\n4 The Shajrat makes M\u0101c\u012bn his grand-uncle's son, viz., son of T\u016bq\u0101 or T\u016bq\u0101b\u0101 the brother of B\u016bq\u0101 who was Q\u0101id\u016b's grandfather.\nhelp of M\u0101cin, the Jal\u0101irs were brought to rue their folly and induced\nto put to death seventy men who had been engaged in the murder of\nMan\u016bl\u016bn and her children. They also bound their wives and children\nand sent them to Q\u0101id\u016b Kh\u0101n who marked their foreheads with the\ntoken of servitude. Their descendants remained for a lengthened\nperiod in the prison of slavery.\n\nQ\u0100ID\u016a KH\u0100N.\n\nQ\u0101id\u016b Kh\u0101n after many adventures, sat upon the throne of\nsovereignty and supervised the world's civilization.\u00b9 He founded 68\ncities and had a following of many clans. He warred with the\nJal\u0101irs and firmly established his power. When he passed away, he\nleft three sons.\n\nB\u0100YASANGHAR KH\u0100N.\n\nB\u0101yasanghar Kh\u0101n was the eldest son and the unique of his Age\nfor administrative capacity and for the management of subjects and\nsoldiers. He sat upon the throne agreeably to his father's testa-\nment.\n\nT\u016aMANA KH\u0100N.\n\nT\u016bmana was the worthy son of B\u0101yasanghar Kh\u0101n. When his\nfather was departing from this world, he made over the kingdom to\nhim. The div\u0101n of sovereignty and world-rule gained lustre during\nhis reign. He graced it by his courage and wisdom, and augmented\nthe glory of the Age by his magnanimity and bearing of burdens. By\nstrength of arm and vigour of mind, he increased his hereditary\nkingdom by adding to it, much of Mongolia (Mughulistan) and\nTurkist\u0101n. There was not his like for might and prestige in all\nTurkist\u0101n. He had two wives by one of whom he had seven sons\nand by the other twins. One of the twins was named Qabal and was\nthe great-grandfather\u00b2 of Cing\u012bz Kh\u0101n and the other was named\nQ\u0101c\u016bl\u012b.\n\n\u00b9 The Shajrat says he dug a\ncanal.\n\u00b2 Though he was only the third in\nascent from Cing\u012bz Kh\u0101n, the latter\nwas fourth in succession for Qabila,\nthe son of Qabal was succeeded by\nhis brother Bart\u0101n Bah\u0101dur and he\nby his son Yas\u016bk\u0101 the father of\nCing\u012bz. This accounts for Cing\u012bz\nbeing the fourth star which emerged\nfrom Qabal's bosom. (See infra).\nQ\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur.\n\nQ\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur is the eighth ancestor of his Majesty the Lord of Conjunction (Timur). He was a theatre of the lights of dominion and a station of the impressions of auspiciousness. The refulgence of greatness radiated from his countenance and the glory of fortune shone from his brow. One night he beheld in a dream\u00b9 a shining star emerging from Qabal Kh\u0101n\u2019s breast. It rose to the zenith and then was extinguished. This happened thrice. The fourth time, a wondrous bright star arose from his (Qabal\u2019s) breast and took the horizons with its light. The rays thereof reached and enkindled other stars, and each of them lighted up a region, so that when the globe of light disappeared, the world still remained illuminated. He awoke from his vision, and loosed the bird of thought that he might interpret the strange augury. Suddenly sleep again\u00b2 overcame him and he saw seven stars rise in succession from his own breast and disappear. The eighth time, a mighty star appeared and lighted up the whole world. Then some small stars branched off from it so that every corner of the universe was illuminated. When the great star became invisible, these other stars shone forth and the universe remained bright as before. At daybreak, Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur reported the occurrence to his honoured father T\u016bmana Kh\u0101n. The latter gave the interpretation that from Qabal Kh\u0101n there would come three princes who should sit on the throne of the Kh\u0101n\u0101te and be lords of lands. But the fourth time, a king would come after these, who should bring most of the earth under his sway and should have children, each of whom would govern a region. From Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b would come seven dominant descendants, bearing on their brows the dia-\n\n\u00b9 Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n (I, 9) makes each brother have a dream but says that the stars seen by Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b were less bright than those beheld by the elder brother Qabal. Apparently he either rejects the application to Timur or holds that he was descended from the elder brother (through Cingiz Kh\u0101n). D\u2019Herbelot has a full account of the dream. (Art. Toumanah Kh\u0101n). See also Sharafu-d-d\u012bn\u2019s Zafarn\u0101ma, (Prolegomena), and B\u0101bar and Humayun, Erskine I, 70 and Shajratu-l-atr\u0101k (Miles). There is a good deal about the dream and the covenant between the brothers in the so-called Memoirs of Timur.\n\n\u00b2 There is a play on the word b\u0101z, the other meaning being \u201cthe hawk\u201d \u201c(b\u0101z) of his sleep snatched at\u201d the bird of thought.\ndem of primacy and the crown of rule. The eighth time a descen-\ndant would arise who should exhibit world-wide sovereignty and\nexercise sway and chiefship over all mankind. From him would\ncome descendants who should each rule a division of the earth.\n\nWhen T\u00fbmana Kh\u00e2n had made an end of his interpretation, the\ntwo brothers, in accordance with his orders, made a mutual league\nand covenant to the effect that the throne of the Kh\u00e2n should be\ncommitted to Qabal Kh\u00e2n and that Q\u00e2c\u00fbli should be Commander-in-\nChief and Prime Minister. And it was established that the descen-\ndants of each should, generation after generation, observe this\narrangement. They drew up a solemn compact ('ahd-n\u00e2ma) to this\neffect in Uigh\u00fbr (Turkish) characters and each brother put his seal\nto it and it was styled the \"Altamgha of T\u00fbmana Kh\u00e2n.\" The\nillustrious ancestors of his Majesty, the king of kings,\u2014who is the\nfinal cause of the series having been set in motion\u2014were, from Adam\nto T\u00fbmana Kh\u00e2n, distinguished by absolute sovereignty and by\nindependent sway, and so established the throne of justice. Some\nmembers of the glorious company also attained to the spiritual world\nand so were, both outwardly and inwardly, plenipotent, as hath been\nset forth in ancient chronicles.\n\nThe Divine strategy\u2014in providing for the apparition of the\nconsummation of all degrees, spiritual and temporal, by the inter-\nvention of so many rulers of the visible and invisible worlds,\u2014was\nawaiting the birth-time of his Majesty, the king of kings,\u2014for, as\nbeing the quintessence of humanity, his robe must be gorgeously\nembroidered,\u2014and so was day by day, accomplishing the prepara-\ntions. Hence in order to completeness and to cause appreciation of\nthe glory of service and the sweets of management, Q\u00e2c\u00fbli Bah\u00e2dur\nwas arrayed in the disguise of vicegerency (wak\u00e2lat) so that the\ngrades of this status too might come within the purview of this\nglorious company and a provision of every stage of development be\naccumulated for his Majesty, the king of kings. Thus, notwith-\nstanding the guiding power, dexterity, greatness and high-minded-\nness of Q\u00e2c\u00fbli Bah\u00e2dur, Qabal Kh\u00e2n became the heir. Though in\nthe external point of age,\u2014which is not regarded by the wise,\u2014he\nwas greater, yet in reality, the controlling power of the Divine\nwisdom was engaged in completing the work (of preparation for\nAkbar). When T\u00fbmana Kh\u00e2n's star set in the west, Qabal Kh\u00e2n\nbecame established on the throne of rule and Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur, in accordance with that fidelity to his promise which is the material of eternal bliss, undertook with concord and singleness of aim, the management of the State in conformity with the rules of loving-mindedness and king-making.\n\nAnd when Qabal Kh\u0101n went from this world of troubled existence to the peaceful home of nothingness, Q\u016bbila Kh\u0101n who out of six sons was the one worthy of the throne and crown, obtained the sovereignty, and Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur remained engaged in the same high office of Commander-in-Chief, observed his compact and, by help of wisdom and courage, carried on the affairs of the State. Q\u016bbila Kh\u0101n with the support of such a grandee, who was possessed both of God-given wisdom and a world-conquering sword, took vengeance for his brother from \u0100lt\u0101n Kh\u0101n (i.e., the Golden Kh\u0101n) the ruler of Cathay and having made great wars which were masterpieces of men of might, inflicted a heavy defeat on the army of Cathay.\n\nThe abstract of this affair is as follows:\u2014The rulers of Cathay always were in dread of this noble race and always kept on friendly terms with it. When \u0100lt\u0101n Kh\u0101n was confirmed on the throne of Cathay, he became much alarmed at hearing of the bravery and ability of Qabal Kh\u0101n. By means of skilful embassies, he established concord between them to such an extent that he invited Qabal Kh\u0101n to Cathay. The Kh\u0101n with the sincerity and honesty which are the characteristics of this family, made over the care of the kingdom to Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur and went to Cathay. His reception was very friendly and after indulging in pleasure and enjoyment, he set his face homewards. Some of \u0100lt\u0101n Kh\u0101n\u2019s grandees of base and ignoble nature, disturbed his mind with improper words so that he repented having said adieu to Qabal Kh\u0101n and sent a message to recall him. Qabal Kh\u0101n saw through the plot and replied that as he had left in an auspicious hour, it would not be proper to return. This enraged \u0100lt\u0101n Kh\u0101n who sent troops with orders to bring him back by hook or by crook. Qabal Kh\u0101n caused the officer in command to alight\n\n---\n\n1 Text, Q\u016blla, but a note says that the Zafarn\u0101ma (Prolegomena) has Q\u016bbila and this appears the correct reading.\n\n2 The Prolegomena l.c. and the Shajrat say that Qabal got drunk and insulted \u0100lt\u0101n.\n\n3 Prolegomena l.c. has Shag\u016bn na m\u016bd\u0101nam \u201cI do not regard it as of good omen (to return).\u201d\nat the house of a friend of his named S\u0101lj\u016bq\u012b who had his dwelling by the way-side, and agreed to turn back. S\u0101lj\u016bq\u012b secretly told him that to return was not advisable and that he had a swift and enduring horse which no one could come up with and that the proper thing for Qabal Kh\u0101n was to mount this horse and get away as quickly as possible from this dangerous neighbourhood.\n\nQabal Kh\u0101n acted on this advice and getting on the horse, proceeded to his own camp 'yurt'. When the Cathay messengers heard this, they pursued him with all rapidity but did not come up with him till he was in his own camp. Qabal Kh\u0101n seized these wicked people and put them to death. Meanwhile his eldest child \u00dcqin Barq\u0101q who was matchless for beauty, was keeping company with the gazelles on the borders of the wilderness when a party of T\u0101t\u0101rs surprised him and took him to \u0100lt\u0101n Kh\u0101n. The Kh\u0101n put this delicate fawn to death in satisfaction for those dog-souled wolves.\n\nWhen Q\u016bbila Kh\u0101n who was the second son, came to the throne, he collected an army and marched against \u0100lt\u0101n Kh\u0101n to revenge his brother's death. A great battle ensued and the Cath\u0101ians suffered a sore defeat and were plundered of their property.\n\nWhen the onset of the army of death fell upon Q\u016bbila Kh\u0101n, his honoured brother Bart\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, was established on the throne, agreeably to the counsels of the nobles. He preserved the institutions (y\u0101s\u0101q, i.e. y\u0101s\u0101) of his father and brother and as in his time, he\n\n---\n\n1 The meaning apparently is that when Qabal was on his way back with \u0100lt\u0101n's officer he got the latter to halt at the house of a friend by the wayside. The Prolegomena (l.c.), tells the story somewhat differently, stating that Qabal evaded his pursuers by entering the house of a friend but was inclined to give himself up and return with them, etc.\n\n2 The \u012bg\u0101f\u0101t of the Text after kal\u0101n is wrong. See D'Herbelot art. Kil Kh\u0101n and Prolegomena l.c.\n\n3 Ghaz\u0101l-i-shirn\u012bsh\u0101d, \"a milk-born gazelle.\" Cf. Dryden's milk-\n\nwhite hind.\n\n4 It is said that \u0100lt\u0101n nailed or sewed him to a wooden ass in revenge for the death of his messengers. One account says he was hunting but A.F.'s words seem to imply that he was too young for this, that he was, as it were, a fawn himself and so, sporting with the gazelles. The Prolegomena seems to say that the child had strayed into the plain.\n\n5 The word bir\u0101dar is loosely used and for the sake of assonance with bah\u0101dur. Q\u0101c\u016bll\u012b was really uncle of Bart\u0101n.\nhad no rival who could contend with him in war, the title Kh\u0101n was marked in people's mouths by that of Bah\u0101dur and they stamped the coin of his courage with this awe-augmenting appellative. At this period, Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur who was at once a life-sacrificing brother and a Commander-in-Chief Bah\u0101dur, departed to the eternal world.\n\n\u012aradam-c\u012b Barl\u0101s.\n\n\u012aradam-c\u012b Barl\u0101s was the upright son of Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur and was distinguished for his wisdom and military talent. On his father's death, the patent (fughr\u0101) of the Commander-in-Chiefship was exalted by the entry of his name and he managed affairs according to the rules which his father had made illustrious. He was the first who bore the title of Barl\u0101s, the meaning of which fine word is brave and of noble lineage. The whole Barl\u0101s clan traces its origin from him.\n\nWhen Bart\u0101n Bah\u0101dur died, Yesugai Bah\u0101dur, the third of his four sons, and father of Cingiz Kh\u0101n, and who was adorned with the cuirass of wisdom and the helmet of courage, placed the crown of the Kh\u0101nate on his head and graced the throne of world-sway. At this time \u012aradam-c\u012b Barl\u0101s died, leaving twenty-nine sons.\n\nS\u016bgh\u016b C\u012bcan (The Wise).\n\nS\u016bgh\u016b C\u012bcan was distinguished among the noble sons of \u012aradam-c\u012b Barl\u0101s for courage, wisdom and administrative ability. He was also the eldest son. He took the place of his honoured father; ostensibly he was Commander-in-Chief, in reality he was sovereign. Yesugai Bah\u0101dur, by the world-adorning advice of S\u016bgh\u016b C\u012bcan marched against the T\u0101t\u0101rs and trod under-foot their glory and their grandeur. When he had, by God's help and the might of good\n\n---\n\n1 If so, it seems an anachronism to speak of \u0100lanquw\u0101 as belonging to the Barl\u0101s family in the way A.F., (according to the MSS,) has done in his account of that lady. And indeed there seems no doubt that Barl\u0101s is a clerical error for Q\u0101r\u0101l\u0101s which is the word in Rash\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn. The Text has laf\u012b-i-mu'all\u0101 \"lofty word,\" but Quatrem\u00e8re (Rash\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn 250n.) thinks that mu'all\u0101 is a clerical error for mughal\u0101s and translates \"un homme brave et d'une naissance illustre;\" and adds \"le mot barl\u0101s dans la langue des Mongoles d\u00e9signait un homme brave et d'une naissance illustre.\"\n\n2 Text, Bis\u016bk\u0101, but a note states that many MSS. have Yas\u016bk\u0101. It is Yas\u016bk\u0101 in the Prolegomena l.c., Yesugai or Jesugai seems to be the correct form.\nfortune, overcome the Tatars, he set out for Dilun Buldaq. When he arrived there, his chief wife (Kh\u00e2t\u00fbn) \u00dcl\u00fbn Anaga whom he had left pregnant, gave birth to a noble son on 20th zi-l-q\u00e2\u2019d\u00e2 549 (26th Jan., 1155), in the cycle-year of the Hog (Tank\u00fbz). Yesugai Bah\u00e2dur called him Tem\u00fbcin. S\u00fbgh\u00fb Cican, who possessed lofty intelligence and exalted understanding, told Yesugai Bah\u00e2dur that by the secrets of calculation and the favourable aspects of the heavens, it was clear that this was the very star which had emerged the fourth time from Qabal Kh\u00e2n\u2019s breast.\n\nCing\u00eez Kh\u00e2n.\n\nThough in the noble line of his Majesty, the king of kings, which in this book of Divine praise is the starting-point of utterance, it is unnecessary to mention Tem\u00fbcin who is a branch of the holy tree, yet as he was a ray of the divine light of Alanquwa, a brief account of him is indispensable.

Tem\u016bcin became alarmed and escaped from that danger by the counsels and assistance of Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n. Twice were great battles fought between them in which Tem\u016bcin was victorious.\n\nWhen in his 49th, or as some say, his 50th year, he, in Ramaz\u0101n 599 (May\u2013June 1203), attained the rank of a sovereign and ruler of the world. When three years of his reign and rule had passed But Tengri, a seer of the invisible world and herald of the Divine Court, was inspired to give Tem\u016bcin the title of Cingiz Kh\u0101n or king of kings. Day by day, the star of his fortune rose higher and higher and year by year, the lightning of his majesty became more vivid. He acquired sway over all Cathay, Khotan, Northern and Southern China (C\u012bn \u016b M\u0101c\u012bn), the desert of Qibc\u0101q, Saqs\u012bn,\n\n---\n\n1 According to one account, noticed by D'Herbelot, Cingiz married a daughter of \u0100vang.\n2 Also Shank\u016b and Shak\u016bn.\n3 Text, ButTengri; but I adopt the variant of But Tengri, given also in No. 564.

It is the Sacass\u012bn mentioned in D'Ohsson. (I. 346 n.) \"Sacass\u012bn, dit le g\u00e9ographe de Bacu, \u00e9tait une grande ville du pays des Khazares.

(See also 299.n.) Mang is given as meaning a mole in Shaw's Vocabulary of Eastern Turkish. The epithet would thus be equivalent to Kh\u0101lder, and,\u2014a mole being regarded as a beauty,\u2014the sobriquet is honorific.\n\nFor an account of the gallant Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn see Gibbon Cap. 64 and D'Herb\u00e8lot art. Jelaleddin and \u0100\u012bn l.c.\n\n1 This date is wrong as perhaps the copyists might have inferred from the fact that just below Cingiz is described as dying in Safar, the 2nd month of 624, whereas Ramaz\u0101n is the ninth. Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn's defeat really occurred in Rajab 618 (Aug.-Sep. 1221). It was therefore the time of the rains which enhances the splendour of Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn's feat in swimming his horse over the Indus.\n\n2 D'Herb\u00e8lot, 4th Ramaz\u0101n. This agrees with Howorth and Hammer-Purgstall who also give the corresponding European date as 18th Aug. Apparently A.F. had inadvertently written the date of death as that of the defeat of Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn. 4th Safar is 24th Jan. (1227). Safar is given in one place by Raghd\u016bn-d-d\u012bn whom A.F. copies. (See Hammer-Purgstall, G. Horde 92 n. 4.) But see Erdmann l.c., p. 573.\n\n3 Text, Tankaq\u016bt. It seems to be the Tunkah of the \u0100\u012bn (Jarrett III. 98) in 5th climate and belonging to Ta\u0161kand. See D'Herb\u00e8lot art. Tang\u016bt where it is stated that the Arabs call the town Tanghikunt a form which approaches that in Text. The country is also called Hia. (See Howorth I. 4 on Hia or Tangut). It lies north-west of China and west of the Yellow River. On some modern maps the country is marked as that of the Tang\u016bts. See Supplement (Visdelou, 302), for remarks on Scheidercou and Tamghoul.\n\n4 They came out under their king Shidaqu (called by Minhaj, Ting\u016b Kh\u0101n) to treat with Cingiz who had\nbody whom they met, so that the news might not be quickly conveyed to the different countries. On 14th Ramaz\u0101n of the same year, they brought the body to the great camp and proclaimed the death. They buried Cingiz at the foot of a tree which he had, one day when hunting, approved as a site for his grave. In a short space of time, the branches became so thick that the tomb was hidden by them and no one could ascertain the spot. There is a strange mystery in this which cannot be understood, except by the wisdom of the wise and far-seeing, to wit, that as in life he was under God's protection, so also in death did he come under God's supervision, in order that the short-sighted might not put forth hands of disrespect against the place. Though to take much thought about a tomb is to make oneself ridiculous to mankind, yet as rulers have to deal chiefly with the superficial-minded, this providential guarding (of Cingiz' tomb) is a great blessing. And why should not the Divine protection watch over one who was so great that an universe abode in the shade of his guardianship?\n\nThough this great man be in the eyes of the vulgar and even to the \u00e9lite,\u00b9 at first glance, a leading exponent of Divine wrath, yet to the far-reading view of the wise, \u00e9lite of the \u00e9lite, he is an emanation of Divine blessings. For in the kingdom of Divine justice of which human government is a ray, there can be no injustice or oppression, and everything which comes into existence in the world of evil is based on certain spiritual principles, the real nature of which the superficial cannot perceive and which cannot be comprehended save by the intellects of the far-seeing and awakened-hearted.\n\nHis years were seventy-two complete and most of the seventy-third had also elapsed. Of them, twenty-five were spent in reigning and conquering. If we look to the dates\u00b2 of his birth and his death,\n\n\u00b9 Minh\u0101j always calls Cingiz the accursed.\n\u00b2 i.e., reckoning the death as in Safar. If Ramaz\u0101n be taken, the age would be 74, there being 10 solar months in a lunar year.\nas stated in histories, his age comes to seventy-four years and three months. Apparently the discrepancy is due to the difference between lunar and solar months and years, or it may be owing to some cause other than the ostensible one. During this period, the high matters of government and administration were made illustrious by the world-adorning counsels of Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n. Why should not a potentate who hath such a kinsman (b\u012br\u0101dar) in blood and in spirit by his side as his director to dominion and fortune, brush with the head of majesty the highest zenith of conquest and rule?\n\nVerse.\n\nQar\u0101c\u0101r and Cingiz are cousins (ibn-i-\u2018am and).\nIn conquest too, they are allied (gar\u012bn-i-ham and).\n\nWhen the drum of death was beat, the Kh\u0101nship was made over to \u014ckad\u0101i. The gist of this distressful occurrence is that when on the China expedition, he (Cingiz) had one night an intimation by a vision, that the time of leaving this mirage-like world was at hand. He called his sons, Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n, the Commander-in-Chief, and the other nobles and pillars of his empire and after imparting to them counsels which might dominate mankind, he appointed \u014ckad\u0101i as Kh\u0101n. He sent to the treasury for the covenant which had been executed by Q\u0101c\u016bli and Qab\u0101l Kh\u0101n and which was the Altamgha of T\u016bmana Kh\u0101n and which his high-souled predecessors had successively signed, and had it read before the noble assembly. He observed, \u201cI swore to this deed together with Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n, do you also fulfil its conditions.\u201d He also had another deed drawn up between \u014ckad\u0101i and his other sons and his kinsmen and made it over to \u014ckad\u0101i.\n\nTransoxiana, Turkist\u0101n, the borders of Khw\u0101rizm, the cities of the Uighurs, K\u0101shghar, Badakhsh\u0101n, B\u0101lkh and Ghazni as far as the Indus, he assigned to Caghat\u0101i Kh\u0101n. He also made over the covenant of Qab\u0101l Kh\u0101n and Q\u0101c\u016bli Bah\u0101dur to Caghat\u0101i and said to him, \u201cDepart not from the counsels of Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n and regard him as your partner in rule and realm.\u201d He also established between them the bond of fatherhood\u00b9 and sonship. In this way the noble line\n\n\u00b9 According to a MS. of Tim\u016br\u2019s Memoirs Cingiz did this by marry-\n\ning Qar\u0101c\u0101r to a daughter of Caghat\u0101i. If so, Qar\u0101c\u0101r must surely\n(Akbar's) came to be called Caghat\u0101\u012b; otherwise the relationship of Caghat\u0101\u012b and his ancestors with his Majesty, the king of kings, is one of glory and superiority not of propinquity and similarity.\n\nThe Princes and N\u016by\u0101ns acted according to the testament. Good God! could there be such a breach of covenant by an eminently wise man like Cingiz Kh\u0101n! The covenant which had been adorned by the seal-royal (Altamgha) of T\u016bmana Kh\u0101n should have been given to \u014ckad\u0101\u012b Q\u0101'\u0101n and he should have been made over to be educated and succoured by the weighty counsels of Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n so that the provisions of the compact might be carried into effect; or did they not produce that covenant till he (Cingiz) was carried\n\nhave been many years younger than Cingiz and hardly fitted to be his counsellor. The passage in the Memoirs isduh\u0101l\u0101r-i-Caghat\u0101\u012bKh\u0101nra b\u0101 Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n 'aqd kard \u016b bar \u0101g Gurk\u0101n n\u0101m nih\u0101d. But A.F.'s view and that commonly accepted is that Qar\u0101c\u0101r acted as a father to Caghat\u0101\u012b. (Shajratu-l-atr\u0101k, Miles 344.)\n\n1 This does not seem quite correct. B\u0101bar's mother was a Caghat\u0101\u012b being a daughter of Y\u016bnus Kh\u0101n, a descendant of Cingiz,\u2014a fact which A.F. notices later on in his account of B\u0101bar.\n\n2 A.F. holds that Cingiz broke the compact by not attaching Qar\u0101c\u0101r to the Kh\u0101q\u0101n (Great Khan). But Caghat\u0101\u012b was the elder son though passed over in favour of the younger, \u014ckad\u0101\u012b and thus; in one sense, the assigning of Qar\u0101c\u0101r to him was right.\n\nThe Prolegomena l.c. states that Cingiz made the arrangement because Transoxians had been assigned to Caghat\u0101\u012b and as Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mangbarn\u012b was still alive, it was necessary to have Caghat\u0101\u012b supported by an experienced general like Qar\u0101c\u0101r.\n\nTimur does not seem to have thought there was a breach of agreement for he tells us that when Taghl\u0101q Timur shewed him the agreement\u2014which had been written on a steel plate and signed by Qabal and Q\u0101cul\u012b,\u2014he acquiesced and accepted the Commander-in-Chiefship. (Timur's Memoirs, Stewart 12.) See too page 22 (Stewart) where Timur's father tells him that he had been Sip\u0101h-s\u0101l\u0101r. Apparently if there were a breach of compact, it occurred when Timur's grandfather, Am\u012br Barkal gave up his duties as Sip\u0101h-s\u0101l\u0101r and retired into private life.\n\n3 I am not sure of the meaning of this passage. My friend Mr. Beames thinks it is that the courtiers should not have produced the deed before Cingiz so that posterity might have ascribed his conduct to ignorance and not to a deliberate design of breaking the compact. But Cingiz had asked for the deed, so that they could not well have evaded its production, and it is difficult to see how an intentional omission to consult the deed could make Cingiz's conduct or that of his courtiers any better. Apparently the words \"h\u0101jir nam\u012b-\naway by the inbred forgetfulness\\(^1\\) of human nature, and thus the mark of censure in the book of his knowledge was obliterated by the line of obliviousness. It is strange too that old writers while treating of this subject with verbiage, cavilling and equivocation have not come to a right determination about it. It appears as if the world-adorning Deity desired to remove from the frame of this lofty lineage, the disguise of the Commander-in-Chiefship which T\u016bmana Kh\u0101n had imposed but which had really been fashioned by the Divine artificers while completing the evolution of his Majesty, the king of kings, (and that so) a forgetfulness ensued which surpassed in excellence thousands of good designs. Inasmuch as the Divine protection was ever guarding this lofty line, no failure in the compact and agreement occurred on the part of Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur\u2019s descendants so that when the turn of sovereignty, which was due to their innate and acquired power of direction, arrived and they attained the divan-adorning Caliphate, there could be no reproach brought against them by the wise. Likewise this was the beginning\\(^2\\) of the rise of that\n\n\\(^{s\u0101kh\u0101nd}\\)\" must refer to the officers and not to Cing\u012bz for they are commonly used of the act of inferiors in bringing something before their superior. I am inclined then to think that A.F. means to suggest as an excuse for Cing\u012az, that he was at death\u2019s door and incapable of recollecting the contents of the deed. Or it may be that the important word is \u0101n (that) and that A.F. means to suggest that possibly the courtiers did not produce that deed, i.e., the real deed, but some other.\n\nThe Shajrat (344) remarks that Cing\u012bz exceeded in recommending Q\u0101rac\u0101r to Caghat\u0101i. Probably this remark is based on A.F. and indicates that the Shajrat was written after the Akbarn\u0101ma.\n\n\\(^1\\) Alluding to the Arabic proverb (Ab\u016b-l-gh\u0101zi, D\u00e9smaisons, Preface) awwalu\u2019 n-n\u0101si awwalu\u2019 n-n\u0101s, \u201cthe first forgetter was the first man.\u201d This again, I believe, refers to the tradition that Adam surrendered 40 years of life in favour of his descendant, King David but repudiated or forgot having done so when the Angel of Death came to him at the close of his 960th year. In consequence of this forgetfulness by Adam, it was laid down in the book which Seth received from heaven, that all promises or agreements should be ratified by the presence of two witnesses.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tim\u016br is regarded as a lineal descendant of Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n, though according to Vamb\u00e9ry, the claim is without foundation. It seems that Rash\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn says nothing about Qar\u0101c\u0101r\u2019s being Caghat\u0101i\u2019s generalissimo. (D\u2019Ohsson II. 109 n.) But he is mentioned in the Tabaq\u0101t-i-na\u1e63\u012br\u012b by Minh\u0101j who was\nlight of fortune, his Majesty, the Lord of Conjunction (Tim) holy existence was the forerunner of the perpetual dominion Majesty, the king of kings.\n\nAfter his father's decease, Caghat\u0101i Kh\u0101n made Peshb\u0101 capital and having made over the control of the army an subjects to Amir Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n, he spent most of his time service of \u014ckad\u0101i Qa'\u0101n. Though \u014ckad\u0101i was younger than he shewed no slackness in performing his duties and in the of obedience and heartily observed the conditions of the will.\n\nWhen Caghat\u0101i Kh\u0101n arrived at his life's term, he app Am\u012br Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n administrator of the kingdom and made his children to him. He died seven months before \u014ckad\u0101i Kh\u0101 the year of the Ox, Z\u012b-l-qa'da 638 (May-June 1241). Qa N\u016by\u0101n, in accordance with his promise, took charge of the ment of the kingdom and after some time, made over to Qar\u0101 Hu Kh\u0101n, son of Maw\u0101t\u0101n, son of Caghat\u0101i, the government of grandfather's dominions.\n\nAfter some years, when Giy\u016bk Kh\u0101n, son of \u014ckad\u0101i beca Kh\u0101n (i.e., Kh\u0101q\u0101n) Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n deposed Qar\u0101 Hul\u0101g\u016b Kh\u0101n, appointed Is\u016b Mang\u016b, son of Caghat\u0101i in his room. Let it not concealed that \u014ckad\u0101i Qa'\u0101n had, during his sovereignty, nominat his eldest son, K\u016bc\u016b as his heir, but K\u016bc\u016b died during his father lifetime. He then made his (K\u016bc\u016b's) son Sh\u012br\u0101m\u016bn who was hi favourite, his heir. When the Qa'\u0101n (\u014ckad\u0101i) died, Giy\u016bk Kh\u0101n in Russia, Circassia and Bulgaria (i.e., Great Bulgaria) and came to the great camp (i.e., the capital) three or four years afterwards\n\nborn 60 years, before Rash\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn. (Bib. Ind. ed. 365, 1.3 and Raverty, 1063.) In these the name is written N\u016by\u0101n Qar\u0101c\u0101r but there can be no doubt that Qar\u0101c\u0101r is meant. There is also a great deal about him in the Prolegomena which was written in 822 (1419).\n\n1 D'Herbelot, Bishbaligh (Pentapolis) and this is no doubt right. It is described in Ney Elias' introduction to the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Rash\u012bd\u012b (82) but it is stated (l.c. 32 and 364) hat\n\nCaghat\u0101i's capital was at Almaligh\n2 \u014ckad\u0101i died 11th Dec., 1241.\n3 Blochmann 429.\n(Howorth I. 158; D'Ohsson, II. 87)\n4 The Shajratu-l-atr\u0101b (Miles 355) states that Qar\u0101 Hul\u0101k\u016b was deposed at the instance of Giy\u016bk who represented that a grandson could not succeed before his uncle (Is\u016b Mang\u016b).\n5 Third, Howorth, I. 160.

When Mang\u016b was covered with the veil of annihilation, Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n again appointed Qar\u0101 Hul\u0101g\u016b to the government of the country and died during his reign in 652 (1254), full of honours and success, at the age of 89.\n\nAijal N\u016by\u0101n.\n\nAijal N\u016by\u0101n was the most distinguished for wisdom and godliness of Qar\u0101c\u0101r N\u016by\u0101n's ten children. During the reign of Qar\u0101 Hul\u0101g\u016b he took, on account of his wisdom and vigour, the place of his father (Qar\u0101c\u0101r). In 662 (1264) he was confirmed on the divan of dominion. The Caghat\u0101i tribe (al\u0101s) was prosperous in his time, but as there was much opposition and strife among the descendants of Caghat\u0101i Kh\u0101n, he got disgusted with affairs and settled in his ancestral city of Kesh until the time when Mang\u016b Qa'\u0101n, son of T\u016bl\u012b Kh\u0101n, son of Cingiz Kh\u0101n, sent his brother Hul\u0101g\u016b to Persia (\u012ar\u0101n) and attached to him officers and men from each of the four tribes (al\u0101s) of J\u016bj\u012b, Caghat\u0101i, \u014ck\u0101t\u0101i (\u014ckad\u0101i) and T\u016bl\u012b. By universal request, Aijal N\u016by\u0101n was selected from the Caghat\u0101i tribe and appointed as companion to Hul\u0101g\u016b Kh\u0101n. That Kh\u0101n treated him with great respect and assigned Mar\u0101gha-Tabr\u012bz to him.\n\n---\n\n1 D'Ohsson (II. 109 n.) quotes M\u012br Khw\u0101nd as saying that Qar\u0101c\u0101r died at the age of 79 but the lithographed ed. of the Rauzatu-s-saf\u0101 (Part V. 69) gives 89 as the age and M\u012br Khw\u0101nd's source, the Zafarn\u0101ma, Prolegomena, gives also 89. He died in the year of the Hare in the Turkish cycle.\n\n2 Five, Prolegomena l.c. gives their names.\n\n3 Text, bi-raem-i-s\u0101lb\u016br\u012b S\u0101lb\u016br does not occur in the dictionary and is perhaps s\u0101l\u0101r-i-b\u0101r, (princeps aulae regiae)\u2014for which, see Vullers s.v. s\u0101l\u0101r. Possibly the true reading is s\u0101w\u0101r\u012b, a present. For an account of this word, see Quatrem\u00e8re, Notices, etc., XIV. 27 n. The meaning would then be \"He was sent as a na\u1e93r or present to Hul\u0101k\u016b.\" I observe, however, that s\u0101lb\u016br\u012b occurs as a title in the Zafarn\u0101ma. (See extract therefrom, T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-r\u0101gh\u012bd\u012b, 26, where we have Khw\u0101ja S\u0101lib\u0101r\u012b.) A M.S. however of the Zafarn\u0101ma gives the word as S\u0101lib\u0101r\u012b. So too, Bib. Ind. ed. I. 88 and II. 23 l.5 fr. ft.).

When Aijal departed from Turan with Hulagu Khan to Iran, Ailangar was made his father's representative in the Caghatai tribe and when Aijal left this deceitful world in Iran, Dav\u0101 Khan, son of Bar\u0101q Khan, son of Bis\u016btav\u0101, son of Maw\u0101tk\u0101n, son of Caghatai Khan, son of Cingiz Khan who had become Sultan made him Amir-ul-umar\u0101 and gave him his father's rank and assigned to him powers of binding and loosing. And being full of wisdom and insight, he undertook the management of the affairs of the kingdom. He embraced the glorious Muhammadan religion.\n\nAmir Barkal.\n\nAmir Barkal was very high-minded and when his noble father, Amir Ailangar Nuyan left this comfortless world, in the time of Tarmashirin Khan, son of Dav\u0101 Khan, he was the only surviving son. As he was always occupied with the care of his own soul, he had no leisure for other things and so, abstaining from the companionship of Khans, he transferred the paternal avocations to his cousins and remained independent in Kesh. He was assiduous in seeking God's favour and in acquiring virtues. He spent his life in that neighbourhood and provided for his daily sustenance from the various estates and villages which belonged to his old possessions and was content therewith till he went to the holy kingdom and the eternal country.\n\nAmir Taraghai.\n\nAmir Taraghai was the distinguished son of Amir Barkal and is the father of the Lord of Conjunction (Timur). From early years and the flower of youth, the lights of dominion and fortune shone from the court of his nature and the notes of greatness and glory illuminated the antechamber of his ways. That noble-minded man had a younger brother, Haibat by name, who was a perfect paragon.\n\n1 R.A.S.MS.No.114 has ki saltanat before ba o rasida b\u016bd and they seem needed.\n2 This is regarded as the third renewal of the compact between Qabal and Qaculi. (Miles 381).\n3 Ahmad b. 'Arab Shah gives Abghai as the name of Timur's grandfather.\n4 In the Prolegomena i.e. the name seems to be Salbita or Malbita, and in the Khul\u0101satul-taw\u0101r\u012bkh to be Bit\u0101.\nof truth and truth-seeking. But the lot of spiritual and temporal eminence had fallen on the elder brother. Like his honoured father (Barkal) he always kept his face on the threshold of the lords of holiness and was favoured by the associates of the portals of eternity. Especially that pattern of the masters of ecstasy, Shaikh Shamsu-d-din Kal\u0101l, greatly honoured and respected the Amir and by his spiritual insight apprized him of the advent of the star of the Lord of Conjunction.\n\nI do not find his name in Tim\u016br's Memoirs. An uncle, H\u0101j\u012b Barl\u0101s and another, Aidku, are spoken of, but they were probably his maternal uncles. They were unfriendly to him (Stewart's Tim\u016br, 55).\n\n1 The Prolegomena l.c. and Khul\u0101\u1e63at call him Shamsu-d-din Kal\u0101r, and the former describes him as a successor of Shaikh Shih\u0101bn-d-d\u012bn Shahraward\u012b (perhaps the famous Shahraward\u012b of Baghd\u0101d). The Prolegomena states also that in 775 (1374), Tim\u016br removed his father's body to near Shamsu-d-d\u012bn's shrine beside the chief mosque. Probably Kal\u0101r is right for the Amir Kal\u0101l whom Tim\u016br often mentions seems a different person. (Price and Davey (Tim\u016br's Institutes) call him Gul\u0101l, a word which signifies red powder, i.e., ab\u012br).\n\nAn Amir Kal\u0101l is described in the Safinatu-l-auliya also. D'Herbelot mentions a Shamsu-d-d\u012bn al-Fakhaur who lived in Kesh and was consulted by Tim\u016br, but Tim\u016br's special Pir seems to have been Qutbu-l-aqt\u0101b Shaikh Zainu-d-d\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr. (Davey and White's Tim\u016br 4m.) Apparently Ahmad b. 'Arab Sh\u0101h is the authority for this, who in the beginning of his Life of Tim\u016br, speaks of a Shaikh called Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Al Fakhuri whom Tim\u016br consulted.\n\nA.F.'s reference to Shamsu-d-d\u012bn's foretelling the greatness of Tim\u016br to his father is interesting because it seems to be an allusion to Tim\u016br's Memoirs where the story is told. If this is so, it goes to support the genuineness of the Memoirs by showing that they were in existence before, at least the reign of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. The story, however, about Shamsu-d-d\u012bn's prophecy also appears in the \u1e24ab\u012bbu-s-siyar.\n\nThe \u0100f\u012bn (Jarrett III, 358) mentions an Amir Kal\u0101l who was a saint of the Naqshband\u012b order.\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nThe Lord of Great Conjunctions, Third Pole\\(^1\\) of the Universe,\nPole of Realm and Religion, Amir Timur Gurgan.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe eternal decree and unchanging will of God hath adorned\nthe world by assigning thousands of designs to everything. Thus\nthe Almighty, by implanting in the fifty-two persons who form the\nlofty line of the king of kings and who are the instruction of the\nwise,\u2014command, wisdom, sovereignty, guidance, favour, bounty and\nother glorious graces and illustrious qualities, fashioned and finished\nthe unique pearl of the Imperial Vicegerency (Khilafat). And from\nand after Qaculi Bahadur, He caused seven heroes of the sacred line\nto descend from the position of visible sovereignty and awarded\nthem the status of Commander-in-Chief and king-making (shahin-\nshahi) so that by experiencing the stage of subjection in the garb of\nobedience, they might in an admirable manner, set forth to the\napparatus of the universal laboratory. And as for the exalted an-\ncestors who spent their days in Irganaqun, albeit we have no record\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Saliqul-qutbin. Probably this\nmeans that he is a Pole supplemen-\ntal to the two Poles, making with\nthem a Trinity. But it may mean\numpire or arbitrator between the\ntwo Poles, or that he was three\nkinds of Pole, vis., qutbu-l-millat\n(religion), qutbu-d-dunya (the world)\nqutbu-d-din (faith), as Timur is\nstyled in the Prolegomena (Zafarnama).\nRuy Gonzales de Clavijo\n(Clements R. Markham trs. 124)\nsays, \"The arms of Timur Beg were\nthree circles like \"o\" drawn in this\nmanner \u00b0\u00b0 and this is to signify\nthat he is lord of three parts of the\nworld.\" He adds that Timur ordered\nthis device to be stamped on his\ncoins and on everything that he had\nand that he ordered his tributaries\nto use it on their coins. Possibly\nthe epithet in the Text alludes to\nthis device.\n\n\\(^2\\) Timur, we are told, never took\nany title higher than that of Amir\n(officer) which is an allusion to the\nCommander-in-Chiefship held by\nhis branch and was accordingly a\ntitle hereditary in his family. The\ntitle Gurgan (son-in-law) refers ap-\nparently to his ancestor Qaraqar\nNayans marriage with a daughter\nof Caghatai, son of Cingiz. But it\nmay also refer to his own marriage\nwith princesses.\nof them, yet they too, generation after generation, were seized of greatness. Though the name of sovereignty was not, they possessed the reality and shewed it forth by preserving their honour while shut out from the haunts of men. And now that the stages of solitude and society had been fulfilled and a complete preparation had been made for the coming forth of the unique pearl of his Majesty, the king of kings, God, the Creator of the world, stripped off the disguise of dependency which had seemingly been imported into the line by the counsels of T\u016bmana Kh\u0101n, and displayed a hero fit for and capable of a great sovereignty. Such was the appearance of his Majesty, the Lord of Conjunction, Adorner of the Seven Climes, Exalter of Throne and Diadem, Amir Tim\u016br G\u016brg\u0101n. This great one came forth and planted his foot in existence in the environs of Kesh,\u00b9 commonly known as the Shahr-i-sabz (Green City) and one of the towns of Ir\u0101n,\u00b2 on the night of Tuesday, 25th Sha'b\u0101n, 736\u00b3 (9th April, 1336) in the Mouse Year (First of the Turkish cycle) under the Sign of Capricorn, from the fair womb and pure veil of her Majesty, the perfection of modesty and blessedness, glory of choiceness and purity, guardian of realm and religion, Tag\u012bna\u2074 Kh\u0101t\u016bn. This axis of the sphere of the great vicegerency and ocean-centre of sublime sovereignty is the star of fortune which arose eighth from out the bosom of Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur.\n\nAccording to the view of one historian,\u2075 the true vision of Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b Bah\u0101dur was fulfilled thereby but, as has already been indicated, this\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 About 40 miles S. by E. of Samarqand. It was called the Green City on account of the verdure of its gardens. (Zafarn\u0101ma I. 301.) It has been described by B\u0101b\u0101r (Erskine, 54) P. de Courteille (I. 106) and E. Schuyler. It is also mentioned in the \u0100\u012bn (Jarrett, III. 97) as in the 5th climate and in Badakhsh\u0101n (!). It is generally reckoned a day's journey from Samarqand.\n\n\u00b2 One MS. has T\u016br\u0101n and so has Abdu-l-hamid (B\u0101dsh\u0101h-n\u0101ma, Bib. Ind. I. 43) Ir\u0101n is perhaps right, for the word is vaguely used. (D'Herbelot s. v.). Kesh is in what is usually called Transoxiana and a variant gives M\u0101wara-u-n-nahr (Transoxiana) instead of Ir\u0101n.\n\n\u00b3 Gibbon quoting Hyde says 1336, 9th April, 11-57 p.m., lat. 36.\n\n\u2074 Sometimes Nagina, e. g., in Kh\u0101ft Kh\u0101n.\n\n\u2075 Sharafu-d-d\u012bn 'Al\u012b Yazd\u012b (Zafarn\u0101ma). The \u1e24abibu-s-siyar says the same thing. A.F. has already censured Sharafu-d-d\u012bn (Cap. I. near the end) for identifying the seven stars which emerged from Q\u0101c\u016bl\u012b's bosom, with the seven descendants\nday was, according to the profound investigations of the wise and far-seeing, only the beginning of the ascent of the constellation and the flashing of the first star.\n\nIn the fortunate Age in which the Lord of Conjunction was born, Tarmashirin Kh\u0101n, son of Dav\u0101 Kh\u0101n, son of Bar\u0101q Kh\u0101n, son of\n\nwho intervened between Q\u0101c\u0101l\u012b and Tim\u016br. A.F. says it is wrong to take for stars, men who did not rule, and holds that Tim\u016br was the first of the eight stars and not the last. But his interpretation is liable to the same objection. It is true that Akbar was the eighth in descent from Tim\u016br, but this was through a younger son of the latter, viz., the third, M\u012br\u0101n Sh\u0101h, and neither M\u012br\u0101n nor his son, Mu\u1e25ammad Mirz\u0101 (who also was not an eldest son) were ever kings. Certainly they were never what A.F. calls world-adorners and cannot for instance, be compared for kingly qualities, extent of dominion and duration of reign with Sh\u0101hr\u016bkh M\u012brz\u0101 (Tim\u016br's fourth son) or for intellectual eminence with Sh\u0101hr\u016bkh's illustrious son Ulugh B\u0113g. Indeed of the six who intervened between Tim\u016br and Akbar, only three were kings, viz., Ab\u016b Sa'id, B\u0101bar and Humay\u016bn.\n\n1 This is singular and perhaps refers to Am\u012br Fat\u1e25u-l-l\u0101h of Sh\u012br\u0101z.\n\n2 This seems a mistake. Tarmashirin was killed in 1330 according to D'Ohsson (IV. Table II.), and Mr. Oliver (R. A. S. J. XX. New Ser.) thinks he died in 1334. It would seem that he was living in 1333, for Ibn Ba\u1e63\u1e6da apparently visited him in that year and Mr. Oliver (J. A. S. B. 1891, II. eleven) gives one of his coins dated 733 (1333). Both D'Herbelot and Miles speak of Am\u012br Kazg\u0101n as ruling in Transoxiana at the time of Tim\u016br's birth but Am\u012br Kazg\u0101n was only a rebellious subject. According to Sharafu-d-d\u012bn\u2014who ought to be a good authority and whom Mas'\u016bd\u012b servilely copies,\u2014Sult\u0101n Qaz\u0101n was the nominal ruler when Tim\u016br was born and his reign lasted from 733\u2013747 (1332\u20131346) but the real authority was possessed by Am\u012br Qas\u0101n.\n\n(Bib. Ind. ed. has Qar\u0101n Sult\u0101n Kh\u0101n and Prolegomena (A. S. B. MS. Oa, 26, p. 69a) Qar\u0101 Sultan Kh\u0101n. P\u00e9tis de la Croix has Cazan. See also Miles 374. Sharafu-d-d\u012bn dilates in the Prolegomena, on the birth of Tim\u016br in this reign.)\n\nLater on, (I. 43) Sharafu-d-d\u012bn states that Tughaq Tim\u016br, a grandson of Dav\u0101 and nephew of Tarmashirin, came to Transoxiana in Ra-bi-u-l-sani 761 (February 1360) and that in the 33 years previous, dating from the death of Tarmashirin, there had reigned eight kings of the Caghat\u0101i line. This would fix Tarmashirin's death in 728 (1328). This is also the date expressly stated in the Prolegomena (A. S. B. MS. Oa, 26, p. 68b) as that when Tarmashirin was put to death by his cousin Pur\u0101n.\n\nThe evidence of Ibn Ba\u1e63\u1e6da against this is perhaps not of overwhelming\nBis\u016btaw\u0101, son of Bis\u016bk\u0101n, son of Caghat\u0101i Kh\u0101n was ruling in Transoxiana. In Ir\u0101n four months had passed since the death of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa\u02bfid\u00b9 and there was on that account universal confusion in that country.\n\nAm\u012br S\u0101\u1e25ib Qar\u0101n from his earliest years up to the flower of his youth, was occupied in practising the art of hunting\u00b2 and the methods of war and battles. In the Mouse Year 762\u00b3 (1361) Am\u012br Tar\u0101gh\u0101\u012b departed from this world. He had four sons and two daughters, viz., S\u0101\u1e25ib Qar\u0101n\u012b, \u0100l\u0101m Shaikh, Siy\u016brghamsh, J\u016bki, Qutlagh\u2074 Tark\u0101n \u0100gh\u0101 and Shirin B\u0113g\u012b \u0100gh\u0101.\n\nweight for he is always confused and vague about dates and he seemingly never clearly states when he saw Tarmagh\u012br\u012bn. But the evidence of the coin is more difficult to get over. It is not however quite conclusive for apart from the fact that posthumous coins are not unknown, we have the fact that there was an apparently fictitious claimant to the title of Tarmagh\u012br\u012bn and the coin of 733 might have been struck by him.\n\nMr. Oliver's opinion is that Jinkgh\u012b or Jinikighai was reigning in 736 and he doubts that Buz\u016bn ever reigned. This is the statement in the R. A. S. J., but in the subsequent list in J. A. S. B., Buz\u016bn is put down as having reigned from 742\u201344. On the other hand, Mr. Stanley Lane Poole, as quoted by Mr. Ney Elias, gives Buz\u016bn as reigning in Transoxiana at Timur's birth (T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rus\u016bl\u012b, Intr. 49.)\n\n\u00b9 The Ab\u016b Sa\u02bf\u012bd \u201cb. Algiaptou (i.e., son of Oljaitu)\u201d of D'Herbelot who gives a long account of him and states that he was the last prince of the house of Cingiz whom the Mughals recognized. He was descended from Hulagu Kh\u0101n. The Shajratu-l-atr\u0101k (Miles 309) says he died at the age of 32, childless, on 13 Rab\u012b\u02bf-u-l-\u0101\u1e25\u0101r 736 (D'Ohsson and Beale, 30 Nov., 1935; Gladwin 1 Dec.). It was Ab\u016b Sa\u02bf\u012bd who put to death the famous historian and minister Rash\u012bdu-d-d\u012bn. D'Herbelot mentions that as the year 736 was full of calamities, it was designated \u1e0d\u0101l lauz. This word both gives by abjad the figure 736 (viz., l=30, w=6, and z=700), and also indicates by its meaning of \u201ctaking refuge,\u201d the necessity for a protector of the Age, viz., Timur.\n\n\u00b2 This is from the Zafarn\u0101ma (15) which states that Timur practised hunting and the art of war from 10 years of age.\n\n\u00b3 Apparently he died in 761 or very early in 762, otherwise the corresponding cycle-year must have been that of the Ox. The Zafarn\u0101ma too, although not explicit, seems to say that Timur's father died in 761,\u2014the year in which Tuglaq Timur invaded Transoxiana and Timur's uncle, H\u0101j\u012b Barlas fled to Khurasan. However the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br (the Prolegomena, of the Zafarn\u0101ma) gives (near the end) the date of Tar\u0101gh\u0101\u012b's death, 762.\n\n\u2074 She died 785 (Zafarn\u0101ma I. 355).\nWhen \u015e\u00e2h\u00eeb Qar\u00e2n\u00ee arrived at the age of 34 solar years, he with auspicious horoscope and lofty fortune and by the counselling of his God-given wisdom which is a station of Divine inspiration, placed on his head on Wednesday, 12 Ramaz\u00e2n, 771 (9, April, 1870), corresponding to the year of the Dog (It) the diadem of rule and the crown of world-conquest and made lofty the throne of sovereignty and world-government. And for 36 years which was the time of his supremacy and world-adornment, he brought under his control and into his permanent possession, the countries of Transoxiana, Khw\u00e2rizm, Turkist\u00e2n, Khur\u00e2s\u00e2n, the two \u2018Ir\u00e2qs, Azarb\u00e2ij\u00e2n, Persia, M\u00e2zindar\u00e2n, Kirm\u00e2n, Diy\u00e2rbakr, Kh\u00fbzist\u00e2n, Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor (R\u00fbm), etc., by means of his world-conquering courage and his capacious intellect, and uplifted the banners of authority and sovereignty in the four quarters of the world and in the seven climes.\n\nWhosoever was befriended of Salvation, came forward to meet him with the foot of obedience and for such an one, the rose of auspiciousness bloomed on Fortune\u2019s pinnacle. Whoever had misfortune and eventual destruction enfolded in his skirt, and disengaged his head from the collar of submission, arrived with tearing of hair at the Judgment-seat of the Dispenser (Qahram\u00e2n) of Justice and beheld in his own bosom the thorn-brake offspring of his acts.\n\nOn Monday of Zi-l-q\u00e2\u2019d\u00e2\u2019 789, he massacred the inhabitants of\n\n---\n\n1 Ab\u00fb-l-ham\u00eed (B\u00e2dh\u00e2hn\u00e2m\u00e2, 43), gives Tim\u00fbr\u2019s age then as 35 yrs. 17 dys.\n2 Apparently on his birthday.\n3 Ab\u00fb-l-ham\u00eed says for 35 yrs. 11 ms. 5 dys.\n4 This might mean either Media and Babylonia or the cities of Kufa and Basra but here it is the former for Ab\u00fb-l-ham\u00eed who copies A.F. says (43) the \u2018Ir\u00e2qs of Arabia and Persia.\n5 Lit. to whomsoever Salvation was the friend of his fortune\u2019s day. Four MSS. have d\u00e2ulata\u015fk instead of d\u00e2ulat as in Text.\n6 M\u00fbr-kash\u00e2n lit. hair-dragging but here perhaps \u201cdragged by the hair.\u201d\n7 It was 6 Zi-l-q\u00e2\u2019d\u00e2 (6th November, 1887), according to Price (Retrospect III. 72.) The inhabitants rose against Tim\u00fbr while negotiations for the surrender of the city were going on and killed many of his soldiers. Tim\u00fbr thus alludes to the affair (Institutes, White and Davy, 119) \u201cAnd I conquered the city of Ispah\u00e2n. And I trusted the people of Ispah\u00e2n and I delivered the castle into their hands. And they rebelled and the Darogha whom I had placed over them, they slew with 300 of the soldiers. And I also commanded that a general slaughter should be made of the people of Ispah\u00e2n.\u201d\nIspah\u0101n on account of their sedition and rebellion. Thence he turned the reins of resolution towards the capital (Sh\u012br\u0101z) of Persia (F\u0101rs) where the Mu\u1e93affar family (\u0100l-i-mu\u1e93affar) became his servants. When news came of the opposition of T\u016bqtamish Kh\u0101n the ruler of Dasht Qipc\u0101k (the desert of Qipc\u0101k, i.e., the Khirgiz Steppe) and one of those who had been supported by his Majesty (Tim\u016br), he twice led his army against him and having exalted the banners of victory, he returned. He traversed Dasht Qipc\u0101k which is a thousand leagues (farsangs) long and six hundred wide and cleared it of the rubbish of strife. A second time he marched against Ir\u0101n in 795 (1393) and brought death to Sh\u0101h Mans\u016br who had cocked the bonnet of frowardness, and he extirpated the Mu\u1e93affar race.\n\nAnd in that country, he performed feats which obliterated those of Rustam and Afr\u0101s\u012b\u0101b and for the sake of the repose of the ministers of his victorious dominion, converted the country of Persia into a thornless garden (gulz\u0101r-i-bikh\u0101r). After that he conquered Baghd\u0101d by the strength of his dominion and fortune. He went several times into Georgia and brought there as his companions, victory and conquest.

Macaulay's account of Sir John Fenwick cocking his hat in Queen Mary's face.\n\n8 Alluding apparently to the taking of the famous White Fort (Qil'a-i-saf\u012bd) 45 miles N.W. of Sh\u012br\u0101z and which was taken by Rustam also.

He was afterwards killed by Z\u0101l and his son Rustam.\n\n10 Auliya-i-daulat, but this phrase is often only a respectful way of mentioning the king himself.\n\n11 This was the first taking of Baghd\u0101d, in Sep. 1393. It was taken again 20th June, 1401.\nhe made a noble bridge over the Indus and by dominion and fortune conquered Hind\u016bst\u0101n. In 803 (October 1400) he made an expedition against Syria, and then raised the morning-breeze of fortune.\n\nThe lights of celestial victories illumined that world-conqueror. On that occasion Aleppo was taken and then the army went to Damascus and shed the blood of the rulers of Syria who were confined in the wretchedness of prison.\n\nNext year he raised his standards for the purpose of subduing R\u016bm and on Friday, 19 Zi-l-hijja, 804 (20th July, 1402), having arrayed his army and adorned the flag of contest with the crescent of victory,\n\n---\n\n1 The bridge was of boats and rafts and made in two days and hardly entitled to be styled a j\u0101sr-i-\u2018\u0101l\u012b. Tim\u016br crossed where Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mangbarn\u012b swam the river.\n\n2 A.F. has a short notice of this expedition in the \u0100fn, under the heading \u201cComers into India.\u201d See Jarrett 349, where instead of \u201cthe booty obtained was not considerable\u201d we should read \u201cthey did not value it\u201d (the conquest of India). Sir A. Cunningham (Indian Eras) gives the date of the capture of Delhi as Wed. 18th Dec., 1398.\n\n3 The reference appears to be to the slaughter of prisoners from Aleppo, etc., after the first battle before Damascus (Gafarn\u0101ma II. 314). Among them were Shad\u016bn, governor of Damascus and apparently many other rulers of Syrian cities. These had all assembled at Aleppo under the orders of the king of Egypt (I.c. II. 287.) Ahmad \u2018Arab Sh\u0101h tells how a number of the chief men of Damascus surrendered themselves to Tim\u016br after the Sult\u0101n of Egypt had deserted the city and that many of these were afterwards put to death (Manger, II. Cap. VI and XIII).\n\nTim\u016br killed them and also the prisoners taken in the battle, apparently because the king of Egypt had tried to have him assassinated and because he (the king) had put one of his ambassadors to death and imprisoned Altamgh Quj\u012bn (I.c. II. 275). But the Text may also refer to Tim\u016br\u2019s severities against the principal men of Damascus after he had taken the city. He was incensed against them because they were Sunnis and belonged to the house of Yazid, the slayer of \u1e24usain, and because they had neglected the tomb of the Prophet\u2019s widows.\n\n4 I am not sure of the meaning of gill-i-qaid. Several MSS. write it without the iz\u0101f\u0101t and as if it were the name of a place. There is a town and fortress of Zillah in Asia Minor (near to which C\u00e6sar gained his Veni, Vidi, Vici victory) but I cannot find that the Syrian Amir was confined there or that Tim\u016br was ever there. Possibly gill is a variant for gill, shadow.\n\n5 Ahmad \u2018Arab Sh\u0101h, Thursday, 27 Zi-l-hijja (Thamus). (Manger, II. 255.)\nhe fought near Angora (Ancyra), a glorious battle with \u0130lderim ('Thunderbolt'), the C\u00e6sar of R\u00fbm, and by the secret aids which rode always beside this royal cavalier of the plain of supremacy, the assembled armies of victory and conquest became his stirrup-holders, and the proclamation of success was issued in the name of that world-subduing lord. \u0130lderim B\u00e2yaz\u00eed (Bajazet) was made prisoner and when they produced him at the foot of the lofty throne, he was, out of perfect kindness and chivalry, given a seat above the princes.\n\nFrom thence Tim\u00fbr went to \u0100zarb\u00e2ij\u00e2n and spent there eighteen months in the administration of justice.

I am also convinced that z\u00eer is a mistake for zabar which I have found in one A.S.B.MS. See Vullers s.v. zabardast where the meaning prior locus in consessu is given and also the phrase zabardast nishastan, locum altiorem, i.e., magis honoratum occupare, together with a very apposite Persian couplet.\n\nI do not know whether A.F. was justified by his authorities for the statement in the Text. The Zafarn\u00e2ma merely says Tim\u00fbr gave B\u00e2yaz\u00eed a seat near himself and the Rauzatu-s-qaf\u00e2 that B\u00e2yaz\u00eed was given an honourable seat (sharaf-i-jul\u00fbs).\n\nA.F. knows nothing or says nothing about B\u00e2yaz\u00eed's subsequent confinement in an iron cage (Gibbon). The story is, however, now regarded as disproved. The Rauzat states that according to the testimony of an eye-witness, Tim\u00fbr at first spoke roughly to B\u00e2yaz\u00eed and reproached him for his obstinacy and folly. The Zafarn\u00e2ma admits this but represents the reproaches as given after the removal of his chains.\n\nB\u00e2yaz\u00eed was restored to his kingdom and allowed the place of a subject or vassal prince (Zafarn\u00e2ma II. 481). According to Hammer, the \"cage\" was a woman's litter. But a recent writer in the Z.D.M.G. has refuted Hammer and has, apparently unconsciously, vindicated the acumen of Gibbon.\n\n4 This statement is misplaced. Tim\u00fbr went to \u0100zarb\u00e2ij\u00e2n before the battle of Angora and the \"18 months\" referred to seems the interval between the taking of Damascus in January, 1401 and the battle of Angora in July, 1402. A.F. says nothing of the capture of Smyrna from the Knights of St. John which occurred after the battle of Angora in 805 (December, 1402) and was one of Tim\u00fbr's greatest achievements. The whole of A.F.'s account of Tim\u00fbr is very poor and bears marks of haste.\nvarious countries came and did homage. The ruler of Egypt coined much red and white money in his name and sent it to the world-protecting Court. Other rulers of the surrounding countries raised the flag of well-wishing on the plain of obedience. And from the pulpits of Mecca, Medina and other holy places, the khutba was read in his name. In Zi-l-qada, 806 (May, 1404), he marched against Firuza-kuh and having won victory there that very day, he, without delay, turned towards Khurasan. In the beginning of Muharram 807 (9th-10th July, 1404) he went by Nishapur to Transoxiana and there in his native country inaugurated a great feast such as astonished the lords of greatness and splendour.\n\nAfter gratifying mankind with largesses and favours, he set forth to subdue the territories of China (Khitai).\n\nOn the night of Wednesday, 17 Sha'b\u00e2n, 807 (18th February, 1405) in the village (mauz'a) of Utrar which is 76 leagues (farsakh) from Samarqand, he, by the irresistible order of God turned his face towards the eternal city and rode the steed of life into the spacious abode of the everlasting world. They brought his sublime corse to Samarqand with the respect due to so great a man. The following lines record the years of the events of this world-adorner.\n\nQuatrain.\n\nSultan Timur is he to whom no king was like;\nIn 736, he came into existence;\nIn 771, he ascended the throne,\nIn 807, he bade the world adieu.\n\n---\n\n1 A town in Mazindaran, on the Caspian. It takes its name from a neighbouring mountain which yields turquoise or according to another derivation, is the \"Hill of Victory.\" (D'Herbelot art. Firouzouh and Reclus 242.)

Babar (Erskine I. 11n.) says it was called also Yenghi. Hence it is the Yenghi-kent (New Town) of Turkistan mentioned in the Ain (Jarrett, III. 101).\nThis auspicious Lord of Conjunction had four sons. (1) Gh\u012by\u0101\u1e63udd\u012bn Jah\u0101ng\u012br M\u012brz\u0101. He died in Samarqand in 776\u00b9 (1875) in the early part of his father's reign. He left two sons, Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n whom T\u012bm\u016br made his heir but who died after the conquest of Asia Minor (R\u016bm) on 17 Sha'b\u0101n, 805, at S\u016bri\u00b2 a fort of R\u016bm; and Pir Mu\u1e25ammad who was made his heir after his brother's death and in whose favour his Majesty \u0160\u0101h\u012bb Qar\u0101n\u012b made a will at the end of his life. At that time he (Pir Mu\u1e25ammad) was ruler of Ghaznin and the borders of India. But he was martyred on 14 Rama\u1e0d\u0101n, 809 (22nd February, 1407), by Pir '\u0100li T\u0101z,\u00b3 one of his officers and thus the stain of an eternal curse was affixed to the brow of that disloyal one.\n\nThe second son of his Majesty \u0160\u0101h\u012bb Qar\u0101n\u012b is M\u012brz\u0101 'Umar Shaikh who ruled over Persia. He too died in his father's life-time in Rabi'ul-awwal, 796 (January, 1394), below the fortress of Kharm\u0101t\u016b.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 T\u012bm\u016br's Memoirs and Zafarn\u0101ma, 777. See Zafarn\u0101ma I. 271 where it is said that 777 corresponds with the Crocodile Year. The death was in the beginning of 777 and so about June 1875.\n\n\u00b2 I do not know the authority for this statement. S\u016bri Hi\u015f\u0101r is mentioned in the Zafarn\u0101ma (II. 448) and P\u00e9ti de la Croix says it is a fortress between Angora and Kutaya (Cotyaenum). See also Retrospect, Price, III. 397. In R\u00e9clus' map it is Sivri Hissar.\n\nBut the Zafarn\u0101ma does not say Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n died there. What it says is (II. 492) that he died three stages from Qar\u0101 Hi\u015f\u0101r (Black Fort) while his father was having him conveyed in a travelling-litter,\u2014apparently from Qar\u0101 Hi\u015f\u0101r for change of air. (See for account of his illness and death, Zafarn\u0101ma II. 490. Also Price Lc. III. 424.) The Zafarn\u0101ma gives date of death 18 Sha'b\u0101n, (11th March, 1403), and thus about a fortnight after B\u0101yaz\u012bd's; according to Hamner, four days only\u2014he putting B\u0101yaz\u012bd's death 14 Sha'b\u0101n, 803 (8th March, 1403). According to Ahmad 'Arab Sh\u0101h (Manger, I. 147) Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n died in \u0100q Shahr where died also B\u0101yaz\u012bd.\n\nOne MS. (B.M. Add. 27, 247) has dar saw\u0101r\u012b for dar s\u016br\u012b and possibly this is the true reading, for apparently Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n died in his travelling-litter.\n\n\u00b3 D'Herbelot and several MSS., Y\u0101r. T\u0101z appears right. For account of the murder (which was committed near Shibarghan, W. of Balkh) see Hist. of Bukh\u0101r\u0101, Vamb\u00e9ry 215 and 'Abdu-r-razz\u0101k, Quatrem\u00e8re, Notices et Extraits XIV. 101. Pir '\u0100li was afterwards put to death by Sh\u0101hr\u016bkh.\n\n\u2074 Also Kharm\u0101n\u016b. It is a petty fort in Kurdist\u0101n. The prince had been sent for by his father from Persia and was on his way to join\nQiy\u0101. The Mirz\u0101 always lived with his brother Mirz\u0101 Khalil in Samarqand and when the latter proceeded to \u2018Ir\u0101q, Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101hrukh told Mirz\u0101 Ulugh B\u0113g (his son) what he knew of Mu\u1e25ammad Mirz\u0101\u2019s good qualities and praised his noble character; and the Prince (Ulugh B\u0113g) always shewed him brotherly (i.e., cousinly) kindness. Mu\u1e25ammad Mirz\u0101 had two sons, Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa\u2018id Mirz\u0101 and Man\u016bcihr Mirz\u0101. When he was ill and about to die, Mirz\u0101 Ulugh B\u0113g came to inquire after him and the latter strongly recommended his son Ab\u016b Sa\u2018id to Mirz\u0101 Ulugh B\u0113g. Accordingly Ab\u016b Sa\u2018id was brought up with all enjoyment under the care of Ulugh B\u0113g and daily moved upwards on the steps of dominion and fortune under his guidance. One day,\u00b9 one of Ulugh B\u0113g\u2019s intimates observed to him \u201cYour cousin (Ab\u016b Sa\u2018id) is serving you very zealously,\u201d to which the Mirz\u0101 replied, \u201cHe is not serving us but is learning the arts of conquest and victory from our companionship.\u201d And in this the Mirz\u0101 was speaking from his perfect insight and perception.\n\nSult\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa\u2018id Mirz\u0101.\n\nSult\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa\u2018id Mirz\u0101\u2019s auspicious birth was in 830 (1427) and he became Sult\u0101n when he was 25. For 18 years he ruled Turkist\u0101n, Transoxiana, Badakhsh\u0101n, K\u0101bul, Ghazn\u012bn, Qandah\u0101r and the borders of Hind\u016bst\u0101n and in the end of his reign, \u2018Ir\u0101q too came into his possession. And with this prosperity and extent of territory which might become a thousand-fold source of intoxication, he was discreet and open-minded and sought for enlightenment from dervishes and ascetics. In 872 (1468) Mirz\u0101 Jah\u0101n Sh\u0101h, son of Qar\u0101 Y\u016bsuf, the ruler of \u0100zarb\u0101ij\u0101n, had marched to put down \u0100z\u016bn \u1e24asan \u0100q-quyanlu\u00b2 but owing to his great carelessness and complete want of\n\n\u00b9 B\u0101bar, Erskine, Introduction LIV.\n\u00b2 White sheep.

The Black sheep are the Qar\u0101quyanlu. \u0100z\u016bn \u1e24asan, i.e., \u1e24asan the Long, was maternal grandfather of Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u2018il \u0160\u0101f\u0101vi, king of Persia.\nmanagement, was killed by him.\\footnote{This is the occurrence referred to by Herb\u00e9lot in his notice of Ab\u016b Sa'id. He says that in 861 (1457), Ab\u016b Sa'id was in a bad humour owing to having failed to capture the citadel of Her\u0101t and that at this time, some evil-disposed persons told him that Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Mirz\u0101 (a grandson of B\u0101ysanghar and great-grandson of Sh\u0101hrukh) had sent messengers to Sult\u0101na Gauhar Sh\u0101d and that he had a secret understanding with her. In consequence, Ab\u016b Sa'id hastily ordered her to be put to death. She was the widow of Sh\u0101hrukh, the great-grandfather of Y\u0101dg\u0101r and had been living in Her\u0101t which had been her husband's capital and where he had died in 850 (1447). Ab\u016b Sa'id had taken the town but had failed to get possession of the citadel.} The Sult\u0101n (Ab\u016b Sa'id) led an army against him (\u0100z\u016bn \u1e24asan). Though \u0100z\u016bn \u1e24asan proffered peace, it was not accepted and being driven to extremity, he cut off the supplies of corn. Consequently a great famine arose in the camp (of Ab\u016b Sa'id) so that for 14 days the royal horses had no barley and as a result of the famine, the soldiers dispersed. \u0100z\u016bn \u1e24asan gained the victory and on 22 Rajab, 873 (4th February, 1469), the Sult\u0101n fell by fate into the hands of \u0100z\u016bn \u1e24asan's men. Three days afterwards he was made over to Y\u0101dg\u0101r Mu\u1e25ammad Mirz\u0101, son of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad Mirz\u0101, son of B\u0101ysanghar Mirz\u0101, son of Sh\u0101hrukh Mirz\u0101 who was an ally of \u0100z\u016bn \u1e24asan. This worthless inauspicious one slew that powerful king on the pretext\\footnote{Gauhar Sh\u0101d (Jewel of Delight) seems to have been Sh\u0101hrukh's favourite wife, and Vamb\u00e9ry states (Hist. of Bukh\u0101r\u0101, 236) that some of his verses about her are still remembered by the people of Her\u0101t. B\u0101bar speaks of visiting her tomb. She must have been an elderly woman when put to death, and the vengeance taken by her descendant was not excessive and was in accordance with the Mu\u1e25ammadan law of retaliation. She was put to death on 10 Ramaz\u0101n, 861 (31st July, 1457. Price l.c. IV, 598.) See inscription on her tomb in Cap. Yates \u201cNotes on the City of Her\u0101t.\u201d (J.A.S.B. 1887, Vol. 56, p. 98.) She is there called Gauhar Sh\u0101d \u0100gh\u0101 and the date of her death is given only as the middle of Ramaz\u0101n, 861. Y\u0101dg\u0101r was only a boy at the time, for B\u0101bar (88) speaks of him as an inexperienced lad of 17 or 18 when he was killed at Her\u0101t in the following year, 1470.} of the murder of Gauhar Sh\u0101d B\u0113gum who was the wife of Sh\u0101hrukh Mirz\u0101. The words Maq\u1e6dal-i-Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa'id (the slaughter-spot of Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa'id) give the date (873 = 1469).\n\n\u2018Umar Shaikh Mirz\u0101.\n\n\u2018Umar Shaikh Mirz\u0101 was the fourth\\footnote{A. F.'s list of Ab\u016b Sa'id's sons} son of Ab\u016b Sa'id Mirz\u0101, being\nyounger than Sultan Ahmad Mirza, Sultan Muhammad and Sultan Mahmud Mirza and older than Sultan Murad Mirza, Sultan Walad Mirza, Ulugh Beg Mirza, Abu Bakr Mirza, Sultan Khalil Mirza and Shahrukh Mirza. He was born in Samarqand in 860 (1455). Sultan Abu Sa'id Mirza at first gave Kabul to the Prince and sent him off under the guardianship of Baba Kabuli, but he recalled him from Dara-gaz for the purpose of a festival.\n\nAfter it was over, he gave him the country of Andijan and the Takhti-Ozjand and after providing him with officers, sent him to that country under the guardianship of Timur Tash Beg. The reason for giving this country to the best of his sons was an exceeding desire to preserve his ancestral territory and as his Majesty Sahib Qarani gave it to his son 'Umar Shaikh Mirza who was of singular ability, so did Abu Sa'id on account of the sameness of name, gave it to his son 'Umar Shaikh. Sahib Qarani is reported to have repeatedly remarked, \"We conquered the world by the might of 'Umar Shaikh Mirza's sword, by his staying in Andijan and being a strong barrier between our territory and the desert of Qipcak and by his guarding the passes, the people of Qipcak were not able to rebel or be turbulent and we could in security brace ourselves up for the conquest of the world.\"\n\nAnd this wise ruler ('Umar Shaikh the Second) also took extreme precautions that no hostile army should be able to cross this territory.\n\n---\n\n1 \"The valley of Gez or Manna which lies on the Dihas or Balkhab, south of Balkh.\" (Erskine l.c. 7n.) According to Sir H. Rawlinson, (R.G.S.Pro.1876, 170n.) Daragaz means valley of the tamarisk. As Abu Sa'id had sent 'Umar Shaikh from Samarqand, the latter would pass Dara-gaz on his way to Afghanistan.\n\n2 Abu Sa'id's famous six months' festival which he celebrated at Merv, in 1465 and in honour of the circumcision of his sons.\n\n3 Apparently Ozkand in Eastern Farghana.\n\n4 'Umar Shaikh was then only ten years old. Much of this is from Babar's Memoirs.\n\n5 His full name is Khudabandhi Timur Tash. (Babar, Erskine 8 and 14.)\nwhich was the boundary of Mongolia. And though Y\u016bnus\u00b9 (Jonas) Kh\u0101n tried, he could not get possession of it and not the slightest injury happened to its tranquillity. That fortunate and lofty-starred Prince was one who weighed his words and was eloquent; he had a great liking for poets and could recite poetry. He had a poetical temperament but was not solicitous of writing verses and spent most of his time in reading books, historical and poetical. The Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma was often recited before him and he was an excellent companion; of open brow and good disposition and fond of quoting good poetry. A lofty genius warmed his soul and the beauty of fortune was manifest on his brow. He had no equal among his contemporaries for administrative ability, care of his subjects and dispensing of justice. His courage and generosity were on an equal footing and his genius was companioned by his energy. He adorned the throne of sovereignty.\u00b2\n\nFor example, once a caravan from China (Kh\u012b\u1e6d\u0101) had come to the hill-country east of Andij\u0101n. There was a heavy snow-storm and the caravan was overwhelmed so that only two persons escaped. When this just man heard of the catastrophe, in spite of his necessities at the time, he did not touch any of the goods but appointed trustworthy persons and attached the property until the heirs were collected from their native country to receive the goods, the rights of each being ascertained.\u00b3\n\nThis king was always of a dervish mind and inclined to the society of religious persons and asked for wisdom at the doors of the hearts of the God-knowing. Especially the holy N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-d\u012bn\u2074 Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abidu-l-l\u0101h, known by the name of Khw\u0101ja \u0100hr\u0101r.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 This is hardly a fair description of Y\u016bnus Kh\u0101n\u2019s proceedings. \u2018Umar Shaikh made over his capital Akhs\u012b to Y\u016bnus and then repented and made war on him. He was defeated and taken prisoner and owed his life to Y\u016bnus\u2019 generosity. (T\u0101r. Rash\u012bd\u012b, 96.)\n\n\u00b2 All this is from B\u0101bar. (Erskine 8 and also Pavot de Courteille.) But the Turkish seems more concise than the Persian. A.F. probably used the latter for his account is in closer accord with Erskine than with De Courteille.\n\n\u00b3 This story is told in B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs (8). The stress laid on this simple act of honesty by B\u0101bar and A.F. is rather significant of the morals of the time. Probably \u2018Umar Shaikh\u2019s self-denial on this occasion inspired his son B\u0101bar to similar action towards the Hindust\u0101n\u012b merchants at Kil\u0101t-i-ghilz\u0101i. (Memoirs 225.)\n\n\u2074 For references to this saint, see\nIn succession to his father, he ruled in Andijan, the capital of Farghana and also Tashkand, Shahrukiya and Siram were in his possession. He several times led an army against Samarqand and several times brought to his help Y\u00fcnus Khan who possessed the dominions of Caghatai Khan and was Khan of the Mughals and was nearly related to him. Whenever he brought him, he assigned some province to him and then as occasion served, Y\u00fcnus Khan would go back to Mughalistan. On the last occasion 'Umar Mirza gave him Tashkand and up to 908 (1502-3) this and Shahrukiya were in the possession of the Caghatai rulers. At this last date the Khanship of the Mughal tribes belonged to Mahmud Khan, eldest son of Y\u00fcnus Khan. This Mahmud Khan and Sultan Ahmad Mirza brother of 'Umar Shaikh ruler of Samarqand, having concluded an alliance, marched their forces against the Mirza ('Umar Shaikh). Sultan Ahmad Mirza proceeded from the south of the Khajand river and Sultan Mahmud Khan from the north of it. Just at this crisis an extraordinary thing happened to the Mirza. The brief account of it is as follows.\n\nAkhsikat which is known as Akhsi, is one of the seven towns of Farghana. Mirza 'Umar Shaikh had made it his capital. The town was on a precipitous ravine and all the buildings were on its edge. As fate would have it, on Monday 4th Ramazan, 899 (9th June, 1494), he was sitting near his pigeon house which was one of these buildings, watching the motions of his birds, when an attendant reported that the precipice was breaking away. The Mirza at once got up and had put one foot into its slipper but had not had time to put in the other, when the whole precipice gave way and the terrace fell down. The Mirza's outward form fell to the bottom but in reality, he ascended to the zenith. He was then 39 years old, having been born in 860, at Samarqand. (This last fact has been mentioned already.)\n\nBe it known that Farghana belongs to the fifth climate and is on\n\nT\u0101r. Rashidi 97, etc., and Nafah\u0101tul-uns, Lees, 465. He lived in Samarqand. Dr. Ricu gives the date of his death as 29th Rab\u012b' I. 895 (2nd March, 1490), (Pers. Cat. III, 1086a). See also Blochmann 423.\n\nApparently only the fort was on the edge of the ravine and the town some distance off. The fort looked down on the S\u012bh\u0101n and 'Umar Shaikh had increased the steepness of the precipice by scarping the rock of the ravine. Perhaps this partly caused the accident.\nthe borders of the civilized world. East of it is K\u0101shghar and west, Samarqand; south, the mountains on the borders of Badakhshan. To the north, although formerly there were cities such as Alm\u0101ligh, Alm\u0101t\u016b, Y\u0101ng\u012b, known as Utr\u0101r, but at present no traces or ruins even of them remain. In the west where are Samarqand and Khajand, there are no mountains. Except in this direction, there is no entry for foreigners. The river Sih\u016bn, known as the \u0100b-i-khajand, coming from the north-east flows west. It then runs on the north of Khajand and south of Fin\u0101kat which is known as Sh\u0101hrukhiya. Then inclining to the north, it flows towards Turkist\u0101n and meeting no other river in its course, it disappears beyond Turkist\u0101n in the sands. In this country there are seven towns, (qa\u1e63ba) five to the south of the Sih\u016bn and two to the north. The southern towns are Andij\u0101n, \u016ash, Marghil\u0101n, Asfara (var. Isfaraj) and Khajand. The northern are Akhs\u012b and K\u0101s\u0101n.\n\nThis unique pearl of sovereignty had three sons and five daughters, the eldest son being his Majesty Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b Z\u0101hiru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad B\u0101bar P\u0101dsh\u0101h. Jah\u0101ng\u012br Mirz\u0101 was the next and younger by two years and was the son of F\u0101\u1e6d\u012bma Sult\u0101n who belonged to the T\u014dm\u0101n officers (i.e., chiefs of 10,000 men) of the Mughals. The third was N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 younger than Jah\u0101ng\u012br by two years. His chaste mother was from Andij\u0101n and was a concubine named Ummed. The eldest daughter was Kh\u0101nz\u0101da B\u0113gum, full sister of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b and older than he by five years. When Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bfil \u1e62afawi defeated the Uzbegs (Shaib\u0101n\u012b) at Merv, that chaste one was in Merv and Sh\u0101h Isma\u02bfil sent her with all respect to his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b at Qunduz.\n\nAfter a lapse of ten years, an interview took place between them, and his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b says, \u201cWhen they came I and Mahm\u016bdi K\u014dkult\u0101sh (foster-brother) went to meet them but the B\u0113gum and her attendants did not recognize us, although we made ourselves known. After a while they recognized us.\u201d\n\n---\n\n1 The modern name is Marghil\u0101n (Erskine l.c. 3n.) It is west of Andij\u0101n.\n2 A town north of K\u0101bul and east of Balkh. Sometimes spelled Khunduz. (T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b, 239.)\n3 Perhaps the meaning is that she could not distinguish B\u0101bar from his foster-brother. (See Erskine, 10 and P. de Courteille, 17). The non-recognition of her brother is curious considering that she was about 24\nThe next daughter was Mihr B\u0101n\u016b B\u0113gum, full sister of N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 and eight years younger than Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b. The next was Y\u0101dg\u0101r Sult\u0101n B\u0113gum. Her mother was a concubine named \u0100z\u0101d Sult\u0101n. The next was Ra\u1e93iya Sult\u0101n B\u0113gum. Her mother was Makhd\u016bma Sult\u0101n B\u0113gum known as the Qar\u0101-g\u00fcz (Black-eyed) B\u0113gum. Then two daughters were born after \u2018Umar Shaikh\u2019s death. There was also a daughter born of An\u016bsh \u0100gh\u0101, daughter of Khw\u0101ja Husayn who died young.\n\nWhen separated from him and also that Haidar M\u012brz\u0101 says (Ney Elias 239) that Shaib\u0101n\u012b divorced her on account of his suspecting her attachment to her brother. When B\u0101bar left her she became the wife of Shai-b\u0101n\u012b and had a son by him. The Shaib\u0101n\u012b-n\u0101ma says her marriage with Shaib\u0101n\u012b was a love-match and it seems probable that B\u0101bar has not mentioned the whole of the circumstances and that her being left behind was a part of B\u0101bar\u2019s agreement with Shaib\u0101n\u012b. Haidar M\u012brz\u0101, B\u0101bar\u2019s cousin, distinctly states (T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rashidi, Ney Elias, 175, 196 and 239) that B\u0101bar gave his sister to Shaib\u0101n\u012b. B\u0101bar\u2019s own daughter Gulbadan mentions the arrangement in her Memoirs, so that there can be no doubt as to the fact. When Shaib\u0101n\u012b divorced Kh\u0101nz\u0101da, he gave her in marriage to a Sayyid, but he as well as Shaib\u0101n\u012b, was killed in the battle of Merv.\n\n1 A.F.\u2019s account of \u2018Umar Shaikh\u2019s family as well as of Far\u011fh\u0101na (Khokand) is taken almost verbatim from B\u0101bar, Memoirs. He omits the name of B\u0101bar\u2019s third daughter, Shahrban\u016b B\u0113gum, from the list, nor can she be the nameless daughter mentioned at the end of his account by A.F. for her mother was An\u016bsh \u0100gh\u0101 whereas Shahrban\u016b was full sister of N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 and of a concubine named Umm\u0101d. In fact A.F. has confused Mihrb\u0101n\u012b and Shahrban\u016b. The former was two years older than B\u0101bar and she was Shahrban\u016b, misnamed Mihrb\u0101n\u012b by A.F., who was eight years younger than B\u0101bar. B\u0101bar gives the youngest daughter\u2019s name as Ruqiy\u0101 and not Ra\u1e93iya as in A.F.\n\nThe Turkish version of B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs gives, apparently wrongly, Qar\u0101-g\u00fcz as a sobriquet of B\u0101bar\u2019s sister instead of his step-mother. The nameless daughter mentioned by A.F. is referred to later by B\u0101bar (Erskine 14 and P. de Courteille 23) so that in fact \u2018Umar Shaikh had six daughters. The wife whom the text calls An\u016bsh \u0100gh\u0101 is called by B\u0101bar, \u016al\u016bs \u0100gh\u0101 and a note to the text states that this name appears in many MSS. She was removed from the harem a few months after she had given birth to a daughter.\n\nWith reference to A.F.\u2019s omission of the name of the third daughter Shahrban\u016b, it is curious to note that a similar omission occurs in two MSS. of the Persian translation of B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs, B. M. Add. 24, 416 and 26,200, though No. 26,200 has a marginal correction giving her name.\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nHis Majesty Giti-sitani Firdaus-makani Zahiru-d-Din Muhammad Babar Padshah Ghazi.\u00b9\n\nKing of the four quarters,\u00b2 and of the seven heavens; celestial sovereign; diadem of the sublime throne; great of genius and greatness-conferring; fortune-increaser; of excellent horoscope; heaven in comprehensiveness; earth in stability; lion-hearted; clime-capturer; lofty in splendour; of active brain; searcher after knowledge; rank-breaking lion rampant; exalter of dominion; ocean-hearted; of illustrious origin; a saintly sovereign; enthroned in the kingdom of reality and spirituality, Zahiru-d-din Muhammad Babar Padshah Ghazi. His pearl-like nature was a station for the marks of greatness and sublimity; freedom and detachment together with lofty restraint and majestic power flashed forth in his nature; in asceticism and absorption (fagr \u016b fan\u0101\u00b3) a Junid\u2074 and B\u0101yaz\u012bd; while the magni-\n\n\u00b9 World-gripper, Paradise-inhabiting, Defender of the Faith, Muhammad Babar (Lion), the holy warrior-king. Babar is commonly said to mean lion or tiger, but this seems to me a little doubtful, for the word for lion is b\u0101br, not b\u0101bar. Besides why should the Turks use a Persian word? May it not be connected with the Caghat\u0101i word b\u0101bari or bayari old or primitive. See P. de Courteille, Turc Dict. 155.\n\n\u00b2 \u010c\u0101r b\u0101lish-i-haft manzar, lit. four cushions or elements, seven scenes or theatres. The four cushions mean four thrones and so four quarters of the world.\n\n\u00b3 Another favourite expression is fan\u0101 \u016b baq\u0101 for which see Notices et Extraits, S. de Sacy, XII., 327n.\n\nFan\u0101 is used by mystics for the \u1e62\u0101fi's relation to externals, vis. his dying to them and baq\u0101 for his relation to God.\n\n\u2074 Usually Junaid but here Jun\u012bd, unless B\u0101yaz\u012bd be written B\u0101yazaid. Junaid was a famous ascetic known as Al-Baghd\u0101di and is said to have performed the pilgrimage to Mecca thirty times, on foot and alone. (Beale art. Junaid). He died about 909 A.D. See Nafah\u0101t\u016b-l-uns, Lces, 89, No. 81 and Jarrett III. 332, where however A. F.'s account is only an abridgement of J\u0101m\u012b. S. de Sacy has translated J\u0101m\u012b's life of Junaid. (Notices et Extraits XII, 366 et seq.)\n\nB\u0101yaz\u012bd is B\u0101yaz\u012bd Bist\u0101m\u012b, also known as Tayf\u016br b. \u1e24asan. He, as well as Junaid, belonged to the Naqsh-\nficence and genius of an Alexander and of a Farid\u016bn shone from his brow. The holy birth of this majestic one was on 6 Muharram 825 (14th February 1483) from the holy womb and pure veil of this gloriously chaste and nobly-born, Qutlaq Nigar Kh\u0101num. That jewel of fortune's ocean and sparkling star (durri) of the heaven of glory arose from a happy quarter. She, the coiffure of purity and scarf of chastity, was the second daughter of Y\u016bnus (Jonah) Kh\u0101n and elder sister of Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Kh\u0101n. Her lineage is as follows:\u2014daughter of Y\u016bnus Kh\u0101n b. Vais Kh\u0101n, b. Sh\u012br \u2019Ali \u00d6ghl\u0101n, b. Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, b. Khizr Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101n, b. Tughlaq Tim\u016br Kh\u0101n, b. Is\u0101n Bugh\u012b Kh\u0101n, b. Dav\u0101 Kh\u0101n, b. Bar\u0101q Kh\u0101n, b. \u012as\u016bn Tava, b. Mutakan, b. Caghat\u0101i Kh\u0101n, b. Cingiz Kh\u0101n. Maul\u0101n\u0101 His\u0101m\u012b Qar\u0101k\u016bl\u012b recorded the date of the noble birth as follows.\n\nVerse.\n\nSince on 6 Muharram was born that bounteous king,\nHis birth's chronogram is also 6 Muharram (sh\u0101sh-i-Muharram.)\n\nThough the chronogram be of marvellous coincidence and unfathomable in its significance, there is something stranger yet, viz., the chronogram is in six letters which are reckoned by the masters of\n\nband\u012b order and he was Junaid's his predecessor and teacher. According to the Khasinatu-l-auliy\u0101 (I, 519) Junaid said, \"B\u0101yaz\u012bd among us is like Gabriel among the angels.\" B\u0101yaz\u012bd was descended from a family of fire-worshippers and was a native of Bist\u0101m in Persia. (S.S.E. of the Caspian and 3 m. N.E. of Sh\u0101hr\u016bd.) He died 261 A.H. (874 A.D.) and is buried in Bist\u0101m. See Meynard's Y\u0101q\u016bt 104, Jarrett III., 352 and 359 and Curzon's Persia I.,283 who spells the name of the town Bostam and notices the saint's tomb.\n\n1 Text, Bisun Tava.\n2 T. R. 173, calls the author of the chronogram Mun\u012br Margh\u012bn\u0101n\u012b and describes him as having been one of the 'ulama of Ulugh B\u0113g. The Luck. ed. calls him J\u0101m\u012b Qar\u0101k\u016bl\u012b. I have consulted the B. M. MSS. of T. R., the name is not clear, it may be Mun\u012br or Mugh\u012br. Erskine (M.S. trs. Add. No. 26, 612) calls him merely Maul\u0101n\u0101 Margh\u012bn\u0101n\u012b. Mun\u012br means illustrious in Arabic and may here be descriptive, so that the difference between the two names may be only as to that of origin, viz., Margh\u012bn\u0101n or Qar\u0101k\u016bl.\n\nQar\u0101k\u016bl (Black Lake) is about 23 miles S. W. of Bukh\u0101r\u0101. (B\u0101bar, Ers. 54.)\n3 B\u0101bar, Ers. Intro. LXI.\ncomputation as a lucky number\\(^1\\) and also the phrase (lafz) *shash harf* and the pips (*naq\u1e63i*) \u2018adad-i-*khair* both indicate the date. Another wonderful thing is that the units, tens and hundreds of the date are all the same (8-8-8), thus pointing to equability of dispositions. His life corresponded to these mysteries of birth. That exemplar of high saints, Khw\u0101ja \u0100hr\u0101r himself with his own bounty-shedding tongue gave him\u2014the auspicious one\u2014the names of Z\u0101hiru-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad, but as this weighty appellation with its majesty and sublimity, was not readily pronounceable or current on the tongues of the Turks, the name of B\u0101bar was also given to him.\n\nHis Majesty was the eldest and straightest of the sons of \u2018Umar Shaikh Mirz\u0101. In his twelfth year, on Tuesday, 5 Ramaz\u0101n, 899 (10th June, 1494), he sate upon the throne in Andij\u0101n. Few kings have encountered such difficulties as he, and the courage, self-reliance and endurance which he displayed in the battle-field and in danger were superhuman. When the inevitable accident of \u2018Umar Shaikh Mirz\u0101 occurred in Akhs\u012b, his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b was in the C\u0101rb\u0101gh (Palace) of Andij\u0101n. Next day, viz., Tuesday, 5 Ramaz\u0101n, the news was brought to Andij\u0101n. In a moment he mounted his horse and proceeded to the fort of Andij\u0101n. As he was alighting at the gate,\\(^2\\) Shiram\\(^3\\) Tagh\u0101i seized his bridle and carried him towards the nam\u0101zg\u0101h (place of prayer) in order to take him to \u014czkand and the foot of the hills. His idea was that, as Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad Mirz\u0101 was coming with great power, the treacherous officers might make over the country to him; if out of disloyalty, they did so, his Majesty\u2019s sacred person might be saved from this danger and be conveyed to his maternal uncles Ilanja\\(^4\\) Kh\u0101n or Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Referring to throws at dice, I suppose. *Shash-harf* and \u2018adad-i-*khair* both yield 888, viz., \\(2 \\times 6 = 600\\), \\(h = 8\\), \\(r = 200\\) and \\(f = 80\\), total 888. Again, \\(a = 70\\), \\(2d = 8\\), \\(kh = 600\\), \\(i = 10\\), \\(r = 200\\), total 888. The great standard was called *shash tugj\u012b*. (*T.R.l.c.93.*) The chronogram is in six letters, viz., sh, sh, m, h, r, m.\n\n\\(^2\\) B\u0101bar, Ers., Mirz\u0101\u2019s Gate.\n\n\\(^3\\) Apparently the Shirun Tagh\u0101i mentioned in *T.R.l.c.228*, as maternal uncle of B\u0101bar and as a pillar of the State. See too B\u0101bar, Ers. 59 and 94. Apparently he was B\u0101bar\u2019s grand-uncle, being his mother\u2019s uncle. (*Erskine, B.and H.I., 334*) Tagh\u0101i or \u1e6da\u1e63\u0101\u012b means maternal uncle in Caghat\u0101i and Firishta calls him the tagh\u0101i of \u2018Umar Shaikh Mirz\u0101.\n\n\\(^4\\) P. de C. (I. 32), Alaja and B\u0101bar,\nKh\u0101n. The officers, on becoming aware of this intention, sent Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ammad Darz\u012b to dispel anxieties that had arisen in his mind. The cort\u00e8ge had reached the nam\u0101zg\u0101h when Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ammad came up with it. He calmed his Majesty and induced him to return. When he (B\u0101bar) alighted at the citadel of Andij\u0101n, all the officers came to wait upon him and received marks of favour from him. It has already been mentioned that Sult\u0101n Ahmad M\u012brz\u0101 and Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n had united and come against \u2018Umar Shaikh M\u012brz\u0101. Now that by the decree of fate, an inevitable accident had occurred, all the officers, small and great, united to defend the fort. Sult\u0101n Ahmad M\u012brz\u0101 had taken possession of Ur\u0101tippa, Khajand and Marghin\u0101n which are districts of Fargh\u0101na, and had encamped within four kos of Andij\u0101n. Though they sent ambassadors and knocked at the door of peace, he did not listen but continued to advance. But as secret aids were always in attendance on this family, on account of the strength of the fort and the unanimity of the officers and of a pestilence which broke out in the camp and of the deaths of the horses,\u00b9 Sult\u0101n Ahmad got into difficulties and came to despair of his former designs. He therefore came to terms and returned without effecting anything. Coming from the north side of the river of Khajand, Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n invested Akhs\u012b. Jah\u0101ng\u012br M\u012brz\u0101, brother of his Majesty, and a large number of loyal officers were there. The Kh\u0101n made several assaults, the officers made a spirited resistance, and so the Kh\u0101n also did not effect his purpose, and being attacked by a sickness, had to give up his vain enterprise and turn his reins towards his own country. For eleven\u00b2 years, his Majesty waged great wars in Transoxiana against the Caghat\u0101i princes and the Uzb\u0113gs. Thrice he conquered Samarqand, viz., once in 903 (end of November 1497) when coming\u00b3 from Andij\u0101n, he took it from\n\n\u00b9 Many horses were drowned in crossing the Kaba and many died of disease.\n\n\u00b2 Apparently a clerical error for 18, viz., for the period from 899 to 917. Some MSS. seem to have 15 (which is easily confounded with 11) and Price has 15. (Ret. IV, 666.)\n\n\u00b3 The Text reads as if it were B\u0101yasanghar who came from Andij\u0101n but B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem. show what is meant.\n\n(Ers. 18) Ilcheh. His real name was Sult\u0101n Ahmad Kh\u0101n and Ilcheh is a sobriquet meaning slayer. (Ers. l. c. 13). He was a son of Y\u0101nus Kh\u0101n and half-brother of B\u0101bar\u2019s mother.\nB\u0101yasanghar M\u012brz\u0101, son of Sult\u0101n Mahmud M\u012brz\u0101; secondly, from Shaibak (Shaib\u0101n\u012b) Kh\u0101n in 906 (autumn of 1500); and thirdly, after Shaibak Kh\u0101n had been killed in 917 (October 1511). As God\u2019s plan was the revealing of that unique pearl, his Majesty the king of kings, and designed that the country of Hindust\u0101n should be acquired and that his Majesty should proceed to a strange land and there arrive at greatness and felicity,\u2014he caused the gates of trouble to be opened in his own native land which is the meeting place of faithful servants, so that in no way could that be fit for him. He was compelled to proceed with a small force towards Badakhsh\u0101n and K\u0101bul. When he reached Badakhsh\u0101n, all the people of Khusr\u016b Sh\u0101h who was ruler there, accepted his service. And the ruler himself was compelled to do so, though this wretch was ring-leader of the unjust ones and had martyred\u00b9 B\u0101yasanghar and blinded Sult\u0101n Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u00b2 M\u012brz\u0101, which two princes were his Majesty\u2019s cousins. He (Khusr\u016b) also showed signs of pitilessness and inhumanity when at a time of calamity,\u00b3 his Majesty\u2019s army was passing into Badakhsh\u0101n.\n\nNow when he beheld the face of his deeds in the mirror of recompense, and fortune had turned away her countenance from his worthless self, his Majesty from perfect humanity and excessive generosity, did not exercise retaliation,\u2074 but gave orders that he should carry away as much of his property as he desired and go off to Khur\u0101s\u0101n. So he took five or six strings\u2075 of mules and camels, laden\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 (B\u0101bar, Ers. 73.) B\u0101yasanghar, who was a poet, was second son of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad M\u012brz\u0101 of Her\u0101t, the second son of Ab\u016b Sa\u02bfid. He was put to death on 17th August, 1499. (B\u0101bar, Ers. 72.) Mas\u02bf\u016bd was his brother. See account of his being blinded l. c. 63. It was in 1497 that B\u0101bar drove B\u0101yasanghar out of Samarqand.\n\n\u00b2 Text s\u0101\u1e25ibqar\u0101n\u012b which does not make sense. Luck. ed. and several MSS., qar\u0101n\u012b, calamity or crisis. \u1e63afq qair\u0101n seems to be Turkish for breaking. This passage must refer to Khusr\u016b Sh\u0101h\u2019s treat-\n\n\u00b3 ment of B\u0101bar when he came to \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r (\u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r-i-gh\u0101dm\u0101n) on his flight from Samarqand in 907. B\u0101bar says, (Ers. 126), \u201cTwice did my course lie through the country of this Khusr\u016b Sh\u0101h, so famed for his liberal conduct and generosity, and that humanity which he displayed to the meanest of men, he never showed to me.\u201d See also T. R. 175. See Ers.\u2019s remarks on B\u0101bar\u2019s behaviour to Khusr\u016b Sh\u0101h (125).\n\n\u2074 B\u0101bar, Ers. 131 and 132. T. R. 176.\n\nLeyden states that seven mules\nwith jewelry and gold ornaments and went off to Khur\u0101s\u0101n. And his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b having put Badakhsh\u0101n into order, went to K\u0101bul.\n\nAt that time Mu\u1e25ammad Muq\u012bm, son of Z\u016b-n-n\u016bn Argh\u016bn had taken K\u0101bul from \u2018Abdu-razz\u0101q M\u012brz\u0101, son of Ulugh Beg M\u012brz\u0101, son of Sult\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa\u2018id M\u012brz\u0101, who was his Majesty\u2019s cousin. On hearing the noise of the coming of the victorious standards, he fortified himself, but after some days he sought for peace and obtained permission to go to his brother Sh\u0101h B\u0113g in Qandah\u0101r with his property. K\u0101bul fell into the hands of his Majesty\u2019s servants in the end of Rabi\u2018u-l-awwal 910 (beginning of October 1504). After that his Majesty proceeded in 911 to capture Qandah\u0101r, and Qil\u0101t (Khelat) which is a dependency of Qandah\u0101r was conquered. After that, for reasons of state policy, he abandoned the taking of Qandah\u0101r and went south and having attacked the Afgh\u0101n tribes of Saw\u0101sang and Al\u0101t\u0101gh, returned to K\u0101bul.\n\nIn the beginning of this year there was a great earthquake in K\u0101bul and its environs. The ramparts of the fort and many buildings in the citadel and city fell down. All the houses in the village of Pemgh\u0101n fell down and there were three-and-thirty shocks in one day and for a month the earth shook two or three times day and night. Many persons lost their lives, and between Pemgh\u0101n and Baktub a piece of ground a stone\u2019s throw in breadth separated itself and\n\n---\n\ngo to a string (qa\u1e6d\u0101r), (B\u0101bar 132) but A.

In both, the passage is the same but in the margin of Add. No. 26, 200\u2014the copy used by Erskine\u2014we have bir kala t\u0101sh and\u0101z. No doubt t\u0101sh (Turk. stone) is correct. Kata is Turkish for large but its use here in that sense is not apparent unless we take t\u0101shand\u0101z as one word and say \u201ca great\u201d or \u201clong stone-throw.\u201d Neither Erskine nor P. de Courteille translates kata by great. I should be inclined to regard it as the Hindust\u0101n\u012b kitla and as pleonastic; yak kitla t\u0101sh might then mean merely a stone. The passages in the B. M. MSS. are p. 135b of No. 24,416 and p. 141a of No. 26,200.\ndescended the length of a bowshot and springs burst out from the breach.

In the beginning of the earthquake, clouds of dust rose from the tops of the mountains. In the same year there was a great earthquake in India.\u00b3\n\nOne of the occurrences of this time was that Shaibak (Shaib\u0101n\u012b) Kh\u0101n collected an army and proceeded towards Khur\u0101s\u0101n. Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 assembled all his sons and marched to oppose him. He also sent Sayyid Afzal, the son of M\u012br Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b Khw\u0101b-b\u012bn (vision-seer) to urge on the advance of his Majesty Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b. Accordingly he proceeded towards Khur\u0101s\u0101n in Mu\u1e25arram 912 (end of May 1506). On the way he received at K\u0101hmar\u1e0d\u2074 the news of Sult\u0101n Husain\u2019s death. His Majesty Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b, thinking it still more necessary\u2075 to advance, went on towards Khur\u0101s\u0101n contrary to the calculations of politicians. Before his army reached Khur\u0101s\u0101n, short-sighted\u2076 and inexperienced men had placed jointly on the throne the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s sons, B\u0101d\u012b\u2019u-z-zam\u0101n and Mu\u1e93affar Husain M\u012brz\u0101s.\n\nOn Monday, 8th Jum\u0101da-l-\u0101khar his Majesty met the M\u012brz\u0101s at the Murgh\u0101b and at their request came on to Her\u0101t.

B\u0101bar, referring to the joint appointment, says, (199) \u201cThis was a strange arrangement. A joint kingship was never before heard of. The well-known words of Shaikh Sa\u2019di \u201cin the Gulist\u0101n (I, 3) are very applicable to it.

While in the Haz\u0101ra Hills, news arrived that Muhammad Husain Mirz\u0101 Daghlat and Sult\u0101n Sanjar Barl\u0101s had drawn over to their side all the Mughals left in K\u0101bul and had raised up Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 and were besieging K\u0101bul. They also spread among the commonalty a report that the sons of Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 were meditating treachery against his Majesty Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b. Mulla B\u0101b\u0101i Bash\u0101ghari, Amir Mu\u1e25ibb 'Ali Khalifa, Amir Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim K\u014dhbar Ahmad Y\u016bsuf and Ahmad Q\u0101sim to whom the protection of K\u0101bul had been entrusted, were looking after the defence of the fort. As soon as he heard this news, he made over the baggage to Jah\u0101ng\u012br M\u012brz\u0101 who was somewhat ill, and accompanied by a few men crossed the passes of the Hind\u016b K\u014dh which were full of snow, under great difficulty, and descended one morning early upon K\u0101bul. The rebels all crept into concealment at the news of his Majesty's approach. He first went to his step-grandmother (mother's step-mother) Sh\u0101h B\u0113gum, who\n\n---\n\n1 Text, wrongly, waf\u0101t kard \u014dghlat (B\u0101bar, Ers. 214). This Muhammad Hussain was the father of B\u0101bar's cousin \u1e24aidar, author of the T. R.\n\n2 B\u0101bar's cousin; being son of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad M\u012brz\u0101, third son of Sult\u0101n Abu Sa'id and Sult\u0101n Nigar Kh\u0101num, daughter of Y\u0101nus Kh\u0101n and Sh\u0101h B\u0113gum. He was thus doubly B\u0101bar's cousin, being son of B\u0101bar's father's elder brother and of his mother's half-sister. M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n's proper name was Sult\u0101n Vais M\u012brz\u0101. Khusr\u016b Sh\u0101h killed his brother B\u0101yasanghar and blinded his brother Mas'\u016bd. He afterwards became king of Badakhsh\u0101n.\n\n3 The report was that they had imprisoned B\u0101bar in the Eagle Castle, near Her\u0101t. (Mem. 214).\n\n4 T. R. l. c. 356. Both B\u0101b\u0101i and Mu\u1e25ammad Ahmad K\u014dhbar afterwards rebelled against B\u0101bar.\n\n5 B\u0101bar, Ers. 214, Khalifa Mu\u1e25ibb 'Ali Qurca.\n\n6 Price (Ret. IV, 67) renders this, mountain-piercer, but it probably comes from the town K\u014dhbar, in Sind, mentioned by Jarrett, (II, 337). K\u014dhbar appears also to be the name of a Caghat\u0101i tribe (Blochmann 613n.) Mr. Blochmann quotes the name of Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim K\u014dhbar as that of a poet; perhaps this is the K\u014dhbar of the Text.\n\n7 Taken from T.

B\u0101bar's own grandmother was Ais or Is\u0101n Daulat B\u0113gum. (Memoirs, Ers. 12.)\nhad been the cause of the putting forward of Kh\u0101n Mirz\u0101, and addressed her after kneeling down before her. Knowing well what her state of mind was, he spoke to her with modesty and magnanimity, and with soothing words observed to her, \u201cIf a mother have special affection for one child, why should another child be aggrieved?, \u201cthere is no limit to her authority.\u201d Then he said, \u201cI have been up long and have come a long way,\u201d and laying his head on her lap, he went to sleep. Thus in order to reassure the B\u0113gum who was very uneasy, he behaved in a very kind manner\u00b9 to her. Ere he had fully fallen asleep, his aunt, Mihr\u00b2 Nig\u0101r Kh\u0101num, came in and his\n\n\u00b9 Ers. B. and H. I, 253 and T. R. 200. The Text is not quite clear.\n\n\u00b2 Eldest daughter of Y\u016bnus Kh\u0101n. She was first married to Sult\u0101n Ahmad Mirz\u0101, uncle of B\u0101bar, and on his death, to Shaib\u0101n\u012b. (T. R. 96 and 196). B\u0101bar, in order that he might escape from Samarqand, gave his sister Kh\u0101nz\u0101da in marriage to Shaib\u0101n\u012b and as she was niece of Mihr Nig\u0101r, Shaib\u0101n\u012b divorced the latter \u201cas it was unlawful for both to be married to the same man.\u201d Mihr Nig\u0101r died childless. (T. R. 155).\n\nA.F. has apparently taken his account from the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rashd\u012b but has altered its language. Erskine who, I believe, had not read the T. R. when editing Leyden\u2019s B\u0101bar, makes some mistakes here. (B\u0101bar, 217 and 218). It is clear that the Kh\u0101num was Mihr Nig\u0101r, B\u0101bar\u2019s maternal aunt. She was probably called Kh\u0101num because she was the eldest daughter and indeed eldest child of Y\u016bnus Kh\u0101n, by his chief wife, Is\u0101n Daulat B\u0113gum. (T. R. 86). She was also the only surviving daughter of that marriage, for her younger sister, B\u0101bar\u2019s mother, had lately died. The Kh\u0101num was certainly not Kh\u0101b Nig\u0101r for she had died some years earlier. (B\u0101bar, Ers. 99 and T. R. 157 where we are told that Kh\u0101b Nig\u0101r died a year and a half before 907=1500 or 1501). Nor is it correct to say that A.F. speaks of Mirz\u0101 Kh\u0101n\u2019s being brought by his mother Sult\u0101n Nig\u0101r. His mother was the daughter of Y\u016bnus Kh\u0101n by Sh\u0101h B\u0113gum but, as Erskine correctly states, she does not appear to have been at K\u0101bul at the time. (It should, however, here be said that Gulbadan, in her Memoirs, describes Kh\u0101n Mirz\u0101 as having been brought before B\u0101bar by his mother, Sult\u0101n Nig\u0101r. This must be a mistake, I think). She was first married to Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd, son of Sult\u0101n Abu Sa\u2019id, and had by him one son, viz., the Mirz\u0101 Kh\u0101n or Sult\u0101n Vais of the Text and afterwards king of Badakhsh\u0101n. Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd died in January, 1495, and some years later (B\u0101bar 13) she was married to \u2018\u0100dil Sult\u0101n (Ers., Uzbak Sult\u0101n) and when \u2018\u0100dil died, to his brother, Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n (the famous ruler of the Kirghises who defeated Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s troops, T. R.\nMajesty hastily arose and saluted her (i\u0161k\u0101n-r\u0101 dary\u0101ftand). They arrested Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 and brought him in. His Majesty being a mine of kindness, gave him his life and gave him permission to go to Khur\u0101s\u0101n. After that the Kh\u0101num (Mihr N\u012bg\u0101r) brought in Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 and said, \u201cO life of your mother! I have brought\n\npresumably from his father, is the most graphic. He says that just after B\u0101b\u0101r had laid his head in his grandmother\u2019s lap, the aunt Mihr N\u012bg\u0101r Kh\u0101num came in. He saluted her and then she bade him go to the castle and see his family and that she would come there after him. He went and she followed, bringing with her, her nephew (M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n) and Haidar\u2019s father, Mu\u1e25ammad Husain. B\u0101b\u0101r advanced to meet her and she said, \u201cO life of your \u201c(dead) mother, I have brought your \u201cguilty nephew and your unfor-\u201ctunate cousin.\u201d (Ai j\u0101n-i-m\u0101dar yezneh (or yugan)-i-gun\u0101hgar \u016b bi-\u201cr\u0101dar-i-n\u0101s\u0101sk\u0101r bar \u0101wurdam.) \u201cWhat do you say to them?\u201d A.F. has altered the words which B\u0101b\u0101r used to his grandmother. Sh\u0101h B\u0113gum and Mihr Sul\u1e6d\u0101n afterwards went towards Badaksh\u0101n with Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 but the ladies were caught on the road by Ab\u016b Bakr and taken to K\u0101shghar where they were im-\u201cprisoned and eventually perished miserably. Evidently Mihr N\u012bg\u0101r was strongly attached to her step-\u201cmother and her nephew and perhaps she was displeased with B\u0101b\u0101r for having contributed to her divorce. B\u0101b\u0101r expresses himself as vexed at her leaving him for Badaksh\u0101n. \u201cIt would have been better and more becoming for her to have re-\u201cmained with me.\u201d (Ers. 232).\n\nThe discrepancies in the three accounts, viz., B\u0101b\u0101r\u2019s (Ers. 217, etc.) Haidar\u2019s and A.F.\u2019s, are curious. B\u0101b\u0101r is presumably most correct. for Haidar was but a child at the time, but Haidar\u2019s account, derived\n\"your guilty cousin (bir\u0101dar), what is your pleasure?\" His Majesty took him in his arms and spoke kindly to him. After that he left it to his option to go or stay. The Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 was so ashamed that he could not make up his mind to remain. He took leave and went to Qandah\u0101r. This happened in the same year.\n\nNext year he (B\u0101bar) proceeded to Qandah\u0101r and fought a great battle with Sh\u0101h B\u0113g, son of Z\u016b-n-n\u016bn Argh\u016bn and Muhammad Muq\u012bm his younger brother. The Kh\u0101n did good service here. His Majesty presented Qandah\u0101r to N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101, the younger brother of Jah\u0101ng\u012br M\u012brz\u0101 and returned to K\u0101bul. He permitted Sh\u0101h B\u0113gum and Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 to proceed to Badakhsh\u0101n. After many adventures Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 put Zab\u012br R\u0101gh\u012b\u2020 to death and became confirmed in the dominion of Badakhsh\u0101n. He always retained his loyalty (to B\u0101bar).\n\nIn 916 (early in December 1510) an express brought the news that Shaib\u0101n\u012b Kh\u0101n was killed and that it was proper for B\u0101bar to move in that direction. Accordingly in Shaww\u0101l, he proceeded there and fought great battles with the Uzb\u0113gs. He was ever victorious and took Samarqand for the third time, in 917 (Oct. 1511). He ruled there for eight months but in \u1e62afar 918 (April 1512) he had a great battle at K\u016bl Malik with \u2018Ubaidu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n. Though he had won the victory, suddenly by the jugglery of the heavens, he sustained a defeat and proceeded to \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r.\n\n---\n\n1 This is in accordance with T. R. 201, but B\u0101bar says he got leave to go to Khur\u0101s\u0101n. It would seem from T. R. that both M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n and Mahm\u016bd Hasan got leave to go to Qandah\u0101r but that the latter went as far then, while M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n stayed. Haidar says his father went on because he wished to go to Mecca. He, however, accepted an invitation from Shaib\u0101n\u012b and was killed by him.\n\n2 T. R. 357, B\u0101bar besieged Qandah\u0101r for 5 years and 5 months.\n\n3 Half-brother only of Jah\u0101ng\u012br and B\u0101bar, his mother being a concubine.

R. 203n.\n\n5 The express was sent by M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n from Badakhsh\u0101n. The courier had traversed the Hind\u016b K\u016bgh in the snow and got frost-bitten. He arrived early in Ramaz\u0101n which in that year began 3rd December. Ers. B. and H. I, 306 and T. R. 237).\n\n6 Lit. turned the reins of his world-traversing steed. Ers. B. and H. I, 322 and T.

He was Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s nephew.\nOn another occasion, he along with Najm B\u0113g, had a great battle below Fort Ghajdiw\u0101n with the Uzb\u0113gs. Najm B\u0113g was killed and his Majesty went towards K\u0101bul. Moreover by secret inspiration, he was led to lay aside marching to Transoxiana and to press forward to the conquest of Hindust\u0101n. Four times did he turn towards this enterprise and as often did he, from stress of circumstances, retrace his steps. The first time was in Sha'b\u0101n 910 (Jan. 1505) when he went by B\u0101d\u0101m C\u0101shma (Almond Spring) and Jagdalik, passed through the Khaibar and halted at Jam (Jamr\u016bd). In the W\u0101qi'\u0101t-i-b\u0101bar\u012b, a Turki book written by his Majesty himself, it is stated that when in six marches, he went from K\u0101bul to \u0100d\u012bnap\u016br, he had never before seen the Garm\u0101r (warm regions) nor the country of Hindust\u0101n. \"Immediately on reaching them, I beheld a new world. The grass was different, the trees different, the wild animals of a different sort, the birds of a different plumage, the manners and customs of the people (ail u \u0101l\u016bs) of a different kind. I was struck with astonishment, and indeed there was room for wonder.\" N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 came to this stage from Ghazn\u012bn to pay his respects. He (B\u0101bar) halted at Jam-\n\n---\n\n1 Ers. B. and H. I, 325 and T. R. 261. Ghajdiw\u0101n is north of Bukh\u0101r\u0101. The battle was apparently fought on 3 Ramaz\u0101n 918 (12th November, 1512). Najm means star and the real name of the general was Y\u0101r Mu\u1e25ammad. He is said to have been Finance Minister. He seems to have been put to death in cold blood and in revenge for the massacre of Kargh\u012b.\n\n2 He did not go direct to K\u0101bul but first to \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r and was there nearly murdered by the mutinous Mughals. Thence to Kunduz and \"at last, despairing altogether of recovering \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r, he returned to K\u0101bul.\" The date of his return does not seem known but probably it was in 920, (1514).

After taking Koh\u0101t, they attacked Bangash and Naghz. Then they went to the country of the \u1e24is\u0101 Khail and halted in the environs of Tarbila which is a village on the Indus and in the country of Mult\u0101n. Then he made several marches down the river. From thence he came to the borders of D\u016bk\u012b and after some days to Ghazn\u012bn. In the month Z\u012b\u1e25ajja (May 1505) he returned to K\u0101bul.\n\nThe second time, the illustrious army proceeded in the month of Jum\u0101da-l-awwal 913 (Sep. 1507) by way of Little K\u0101bul (Khurd K\u0101bul) to the conquest of Hindust\u0101n. They went first from Mandraur by \u0100tar and Shiweh and then returned owing to differences of opinion among the officers. They crossed by K\u016bner and N\u016brgil and from K\u016bner he (B\u0101bar) came on a raft (j\u0101la) to the camp and then by way of B\u0101dij to K\u0101bul.

The Burh\u0101n-i-q\u0101\u1e6di describes a raft as a thing made of wood and grass on (P under) which inflated mass\u0101ks are laid and which is used for crossing deep streams. Probably B\u0101bar used one only for crossing the river. Raverty (Notes, 34) quotes a description of a raft from Jah\u0101ng\u012br's Memoirs. This kind of raft is still in use. \"From Jal\u0101l\u0101bd we embarked on rafts of inflated skins and dropped down with the stream to Peshawur.\" (Journey to the source of the Oxus. Wood, 280). See too \"At the Court of the Am\u012br,\" Gray, 12.\n\n9 This name does not seem known now. Ers. (B\u0101bar, 142n.) suggests B\u0101dp\u0101sh. Price remarks (173n.) that he has not been able to find in the maps any of the places mentioned in this expedition. I have altered the names of the Text so as to accord with Erskine.\nof his crossing was engraved on a stone above B\u0101dij. This wondrous writing still exists. Till this time, the noble descendants of the Lord of Conjunction were called Mirz\u0101s. His Majesty ordered that in this inscription, he should be styled P\u0101dsh\u0101h.\n\nOn Tuesday, 4 Z\u012bl-i-q\u0101\u2018da of this auspicious year (6th March, 1508), occurred, in the citadel of K\u0101bul, the fortunate birth of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b (Hum\u0101y\u016bn). Of this an account will be given hereafter.\n\nThe third time, on Monday, 1 Mu\u1e25arram 925 (3rd Jan., 1519), while the army was marching against Bajaur, there was a great earthquake which lasted for half a sidereal hour. Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn Siw\u0101d\u012b (of Swat) arrived as an envoy on the part of Sult\u0101n Vais Siw\u0101d\u012b. In a short time, the fort of Bajaur was captured and was presented to Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n B\u0113g, son of Maul\u0101n\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad \u0160adr, who had been one of the great officers under Mirz\u0101 \u2018Umar Shaikh. This Khw\u0101ja was related to his Majesty in a singular manner for his six brothers had given their lives in his service. He himself was a special prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of his Majesty on account of his wisdom and sagacity. When his Majesty was contemplating the Siw\u0101d (Swat) expedition and the conquest of the Y\u016bsufz\u0101is, T\u0101\u016bs Kh\u0101n, the younger brother\n\n---\n\n1 One MS. has \u201cThis writing has not yet disappeared.\u201d\n\nThe pass was east of K\u0101bul and near the Lamghan (Laghman) district. (B\u0101bar, Ers., 142). According to Raverty, (Notes, 100) the proper spelling is \u0628\u0627\u062f\u067e\u0627\u062c\u2014b\u0101d meaning wind and paj or fajj Ar. for pass. \u201cThus B\u0101dpaj means the Windy Pass, the name being given on account of the strong wind generally blowing there and which at times, renders its passage impracticable.\u201d Probably then this is the pass described by a friend (? Alexander Burnes, Erskine Hist. I., 517) of Mr. Erskine as B\u0101dp\u0101sh. (B\u0101bar, Ers., 142n.) \u201cB\u0101dp\u0101sh is a steep kotal (pass) half a day\u2019s journey to the north of Andr\u016br on the K\u0101bul River and about 16 or 18 miles west of Targar\u012b where the streams of Aling\u0101r and Alishang join.\u201d (I. c. 142n.)\n\n2 B\u0101bar merely says that the change took place at this period but, by the word t\u0101r\u012bkh, A.F. seems to mean that the title was adopted in the inscription. It would be interesting to know if it still exists. B\u0101bar complains that it was not well cut.\n\n3 Text, Saturday but Monday, MSS. and B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs? de Courteille II. 36 note.\n\n4 T.R., 468. According to B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem. Bajaur was taken before Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn\u2019s arrival and not after, as A. F.\u2019s account implies.\nof Sh\u0101h Mans\u016br, who was chieftain of the Y\u016bsufz\u0101\u012b tribe, brought the latter's daughter and uttered words of humility and submission. There was also a difficulty about supplies of corn in that country of wild beasts. His (B\u0101bar's) fixed determination too was to undertake the expedition to Hindust\u0101n. He turned his rein from Siw\u0101d. Although the preparations for the march to India had not been made and the officers were not in favour of it, he lighted the torch of courage and set forth for the tenebrous regions of Hindust\u0101n. On the morning of Thursday, 16 Mu\u1e25arram, he crossed the river (Indus) with horses, camels and baggage, while the camp (urd\u0101) b\u0101z\u0101r was floated across on rafts. They encamped at Kac\u0101k\u014dt.\n\nSeven kos from Bh\u012bra, towards the north, there is a mountain, called in the Zafarn\u0101ma and other books, the hill of J\u016bd and there they encamped. His Majesty writes in his Memoirs (Erskine, 254), \"At first I was ignorant of the origin of its name, but afterwards discovered that in this hill there were two races of men descended of the same father. One tribe is called J\u016bd, the other Jenj\u016bh\u0113h.\" He sent 'Abdu-r-rah\u012bm Shagh\u0101w\u0101l to Bh\u012bra in order to reassure the people and prevent anyone from committing violence. At the end of the day, he halted east of Bh\u012bra, on the bank of the river Bihat.\n\n---\n\n1 B\u0101bar married her. (Ers., 250n.) Her name was Bibi Mub\u0101rak according to Raverty. (Notes, 234). Erskine, B\u0101bar's Memoirs, 251n. calls her Bibi Macherikah.\n\n2 Siw\u0101d means also blackness.\n\n3 Text, part\u0101l but the word is Hind\u016bst\u0101nI and spelt partal.\n\n4 Perhaps there are two Bh\u012bras. (B\u0101bar, Ers., 253n.) B\u0101bar speaks (253) of J\u016bd as 7 kos from Bh\u012bra and (255) of the middle of J\u016bd's being 10 kos from Bh\u012bra. J\u016bd evidently belonged to the Salt Range. Erskine remarks that B\u0101bar's account of it is not very exact and that he considered all the rough and mountainous country between the Khaibar and Salt Ranges to be one hill.\n\nErskine or rather Leyden (for the latter's translation comes down to this point) says (254) \"This hill got the name of J\u016bd from a supposed resemblance to the celebrated hill of J\u016bd (Ararat).\" This makes B\u0101bar and A.F. more intelligible but the passage is not in the Turkish (P. de C. II, 54) and has the air of being a marginal note which has slipped into the text. Moreover Ararat is J\u016bdi or J\u016bda and not J\u016bd. Nor does it seem likely that there is any resemblance between the lofty isolated Ararat and a spur of the Salt Range. J\u016bd is probably Sanscrit yuddha 'war.' The reference to the K\u016bh-i-J\u016bd in the Zafarn\u0101ma is at II, 48, l. 1.\n(Jhelam, the ancient Hydaspes). He levied 400,000 *sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs* from Bh\u012bra as the price of protection, and presented the country to Hind\u016b B\u0113g, assigning the revenues of it to him as a maintenance. Khush\u0101b he made over to Sh\u0101h \u1e24asan and arranged that he should assist Hind\u016b B\u0113g. He sent Mull\u0101 Murshid on an embassy to Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101him, son of Sult\u0101n Sikandar L\u014ddi, who had succeeded his father five or six months previously in the kingdom of Hindust\u0101n, in order to convey to him salutary counsels. Daulat Kh\u0101n, the governor of L\u0101h\u014dr, detained the ambassador and with utter folly, sent him back without having fulfilled his mission. On Friday, 2 Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal (4th March, 1519), the news came of the birth of an auspicious son. As the expedition against Hindust\u0101n was then in progress, he was by secret inspiration and augury, named Hind\u0101l. On Monday, 5 Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal the administration of Bh\u012bra was given to Hind\u016b B\u0113g and he\n\n---\n\n1 About ten or eleven pence each, (B\u0101bar, Ers., 254n. and 335) so that the sum levied was some \u00a320,000. The Text might read that this money was given to Hind\u016b B\u0113g and has been so understood by Price (Ret. IV, 674), but if so, A.F. seems to have mistaken his authority (B\u0101bar, 256, 258 and 309) where B\u0101bar says he divided the money among his troops. P. de C. (II, 64) does not mention the sum 400,000 *sh\u012bs*, but represents B\u0101bar as stating that he assembled the headmen of Bh\u012bra and fixed their ransom at a thousand *sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs* apiece. A.F.'s Text has *c\u0101h\u0101r \u02bfad sh\u0101hrukh\u012b m\u0101l* and which is unintelligible. The MSS. give the correct *m\u0101l-i-am\u0101n*, price of peace.\n\n2 Incorrect. B\u0101bar says (Ers., 260) that he bestowed Khush\u0101b on Lenger Kh\u0101n who was the prime cause and adviser of the expedition and that he left him behind to support Hind\u016b B\u0113g. Khush\u0101b is on the right bank of the Jhelam while Bh\u012bra is on the left.\n\n3 P. de C. II, 62 gives Thursday 1 Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal (3rd March, 1519). Apparently the ambassador was sent partly to claim some portions of the Panj\u0101b which had been held by the Turks from the days of T\u012bm\u016br.\n\n4 Erskine considers the date of Sikandar's death uncertain but would put it in 1518 (B. and H. I, 407n.) but there does not seem sufficient reason for doubting Firighta's statement that he died in November 1517. B\u0101bar's statement (Ers., 257) is too loosely expressed to be relied on.\n\n5 The affix *\u0101l* is Turkish and means 'to take,' so that Hind\u0101l would mean \"taken of India.\" According to B\u0101bar, P.de Courteille II, 46 (the passage is not in Erskine) the name was given by M\u0101him the wife of B\u0101bar and adopting mother of Hind\u0101l.\n\n6 Text, Sunday, 15th, but vide B\u0101bar, 259. One MS. has 11 (eleventh) which is the right day of the month for Sunday.\n(B\u0101bar) for state reasons, proceeded to return to K\u0101bul. On Thursday, the last day of Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal (31st March) he arrived at K\u0101bul. On 25 Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-\u0101khar (April 25th) Hind\u016b B\u0113g who, out of carelessness, had left Bh\u012bra, came to K\u0101bul.\n\nThe date of the setting out of the fourth expedition has not come to light but it appears that he (B\u0101bar) returned after the taking of L\u0101h\u014dr and from the chronogram of the taking of D\u012bp\u0101lp\u016br, which will be stated hereafter, it appears that the expedition was in 930 (1524). As every event has its special time, this splendid project (of conquering India) was postponed. The ostensible cause of this was the sluggishness of the officers and the non-co-operation of his brothers. At last, on the fifth time, by the guidance of God and the leadership of Fortune, on Friday, 1st \u0160afar 932 (17th Nov., 1525), when the Sun was in Sagittarius, the standards of light were unfurled, such as might disperse the darkness of an universe, and placing the foot of resolve in the stirrup of reliance on God and of abstention from sin, he proceeded towards the conquest of India. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n was left in Qandah\u0101r and the care of K\u0101bul was also entrusted to him. When this expedition was made, victory followed on victory and fortune upon fortune. L\u0101h\u014dr and some other large cities of India were taken and on 17 \u0160afar (3rd Dec.) his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, Jannat-ashiy\u0101n\u012b, Na\u0161\u012bru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Hum\u0101y\u016bn arrived from Badakhsh\u0101n with his army, at the camp which was in the B\u0101gh-i-waf\u0101.\n\n---\n\n1 B\u0101bar does not blame him but says he was left without sufficient means. (267).\n\n2 This is explained by B\u0101bar (Ers., 368) where W\u0101sit shahr Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal is given as the chronogram of the taking of D\u012bp\u0101lp\u016br. These words yield \u201cMiddle of Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal 930\u201d and so the conquest occurred about 22nd Jan., 1524. See Akbarn\u0101ma I, 110 where the reading is W\u0101sat. This seems the more correct as W\u0101sit would yield 931. B\u0101bar thus alludes to this expedition (Ers., 141). \u201cIn the year in which I defeated Bah\u0101r Kh\u0101n and conquered L\u0101h\u014dr and D\u012bp\u0101lp\u016br, I brought plantains and planted them here,\u201d (in the B\u0101gh-i-waf\u0101, near Jal\u0101l\u0101bd). D\u012bp\u0101lp\u016br is in the Montgomery District, Panj\u0101b, and formerly on the Beas. It is now in a state of decay owing to its distance from the river. Text, D\u012bb\u0101lp\u016br and according to Raverty, this is correct. (J.A.S.B. 1892, Part I. 375n. 380) Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n (I, 47) has a good deal to say about this expedition.\n\n3 For B\u0101bar\u2019s vows of penitence, see Memoirs, Ers., 292.\n\n4 B\u0101bar made this garden in 914, (1508). It was opposite \u0100d\u012bnap\u016br which was south of the K\u0101bul River.\nriages there were placed six or seven gabions so that the matchlock men might fire their pieces from behind them in security. In a few days these arrangements were completed.\n\nAt length on Thursday, the last day of Jum\u0101da-l-\u0101khar (12th April) the phoenix (hum\u0101) of victory made a shade with his wings at the city of P\u0101n\u012bpat. The ranks of the army were arranged in an excellent manner. The right wing rested on the city and environs, and the carriages and gabions were placed in front of the centre. The left wing was defended by trees and ditches. Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, with a large army was drawn up six k\u014ds from the city and for a week the young men and the veterans daily engaged numerous bodies of the enemy on the borders of the hostile camp and were always victorious. At length on Friday, 8 Rajab (20th April) Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm marched against the camp with a mighty army and an array of elephants. His Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b also drew up his forces and adorned the battle-field in the following manner.\n\n**Battle between His Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b and Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and account of the array.**\n\nAs the Protector and Doer desired to repair old defeats and to convert past afflictions into felicities, He arranged the preliminaries for this, and set things in order. Among such arrangements were the advancing of Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm for the purpose of giving battle and the drawing up of the army of his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b. As the Divine aid was accompanying the latter, and ever-increasing fortune was in his van, he, in spite of a plenitude of difficulties and a paucity of favouring circumstances, had recourse with a tranquil mind and firm soul to the inalterable Arbiter and addressed himself to the marshalling of his troops.\n\nThe centre was adorned by the presence of his Majesty in person. In the right centre which the Turks call \u016bnk-gh\u016bl, Tim\u016br Sult\u0101n, Sulaim\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, Amir Mu\u1e25ammad\u012b K\u014dkult\u0101sh, Amir Sh\u0101h Man\u1e63\u016br Barlas, Amir Y\u016bnus \u2018Al\u012b, Amir Darwesh Muhammad S\u0101rb\u0101n, Amir\n\n---\n\n1 Tur\u0101, (Vullers s.v. and Quatrem\u00e8re, Hist. of the Mongols, 337n. 130).

See B\u0101bar, Era., 227 where this and other terms are explained.\n'Abdu-l-l\u00e2h Kit\u00e2bd\u00e2r were stationed. On the left centre which the Turks call sul-gh\u00fbl, Amir Khalifa, Khw\u00e2ja Mir M\u00eer\u00e2n Sadr, Amir Ahm\u00e2di Parw\u00e2nc\u00ee, Amir Tardi B\u00eag, brother of K\u00fbc B\u00eag, Muhibb 'Ali Khalifa, M\u00eerz\u00e2 B\u00eag Tarkh\u00e2n were stationed. The right wing was in charge of his Majesty Jah\u00e2nban\u00ee Jannat-\u00e2shiy\u00e2n\u00ee; Amir Khw\u00e2ja Kal\u00e2n B\u00eag, Sult\u00e2n Muhammed Duld\u00e2i, Amir Hind\u00fb B\u00eag, Wali Kh\u00e2zin, Pir Quli S\u00eest\u00e2n\u00ee were in attendance on him.

In the vanguard were Khusr\u00fb Kokult\u00e2sh and Muhammed 'Ali Jangjang;\u00b9 Amir 'Abdu-l-'az\u00eez had charge of the reserve. At the flank of the right wing, Wali Kaz\u00eel,\u00b2 Malik Q\u00e2sim, B\u00e2b\u00e2 Qashqa with their Mughals, were appointed as a flanking-party (talgh\u00e2ma). At the extremity of the left wing, were stationed Qar\u00e2q\u00fbzi, Ab\u00fb-l-Muhammad N\u00eezab\u00e2z (lance-player), Shaikh 'Ali, Shaikh Jam\u00e2l, Tengri Quli Mughal, as a flanking-party.

A great victory for the servants always taking refuge in God became manifest. Sult\u00e2n Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem was slain unrecognised and in a corner, and numerous Afgh\u00e2ns were the harvest of the royal sword, and the caravans of the city of destruction were conducted to the rest-house of annihilation by the escort of victorious soldiers and the flambeaux of world-opening swords.

Men of judgment and experience feel powerless to panegyrize properly this masterpiece of the Ages.

In short, his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b, on the rising of the lights of victory glorified his forehead-mirror with the dust of thanksgiving prostration. He proclaimed presents to all mankind and sent his servants to all countries and regions.\n\nBut a deed fit to surpass the lofty designs of those world-opening princes who conquered Hind\u016bst\u0101n, was the victory of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b which by the blessing of the existence of his Majesty, the king of kings (Akbar) took place in the plain of Sihrind.\u00b9 Accordingly an account will hereafter be given of how with 3,000 men, he delivered India from Sikandar S\u016br who had more than 80,000 men. Still stranger is the masterpiece of fortune of the Shadow of God (Akbar) who by the Divine aid so rescued India with a few men from the hands of many rebellions\u00b2 chiefs that the tongue of the Age becomes dumb before it.

And he himself, on Wednesday, 12 Rajab, (25th April, 1526), alighted at Delhi. On Friday, 21st (4th May) he unfolded the umbrella of fortune in Agra and dispelled the darkness of the land.\n\nEveryone, small and great, in Hind\u016bst\u0101n experienced the royal kindness and balminess. Out of his comprehensive kindness, the mother, children and dependants of Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm were made partakers of his bounty and special stipends were assigned to them. An allowance of a property worth seven lakhs of tankas was made to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s mother. Similarly pensions were bestowed on his other relatives. The distracted world was soothed. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni Jannat-ashhiy\u0101ni who had previously arrived at Agra, presented a diamond eight mi\u1e63g\u0101ls in weight and which was valued by jewelers at one-half of the daily expenditure of the inhabited world.

For full discussion of the question, see Tavernier\u2019s Travels trs. Valentine Ball, II, 431 et seq.\n\nI have treated of this subject in the Calcutta Review, &c., and my conclusion is that the B\u0101bar diamond is the K\u014dh-i-n\u016br. Hum\u0101y\u016bn carried the diamond away with him and gave it to Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp who sent it to the king of Ahmadnagar.\n\n4 The text seems to say that \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn got it from Vikram\u0101ditya\u2019s heirs and has been so understood by Price. But both Ers. and P. de C. make it B\u0101bar\u2019s statement that Hum\u0101y\u016bn got it from Vikram\u0101ditya\u2019s heirs. How \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn got it is not explained.

His Majesty, from the nobility of his nature, first accepted it and then returned it to him (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) as a present.\n\nOn Saturday,\u00b9 29th Rajab, he began to examine and distribute the treasures and hoards, the collections of many kings. He gave his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni, 70 lakhs of Sikandari tankas and a treasure-house of which no account or inventory had been taken. To the Am\u012brs, he gave in accordance with their rank from five to ten lakhs of tankas and to every soldier and servant he gave presents superior to their position. All the man of learning, small and great, were made happy by gifts. No one, either in the camp or the cantonment (urd\u016b-bazar) went without a share in the good fortune. The scions\u00b2 of the royal family in Badakhsh\u0101n, K\u0101bul and Qandah\u0101r also received presents, viz., K\u0101mr\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, 17 lakhs of tankas; Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n\u00b3 according to their rank 15 lakhs and similarly \u2018Askar\u012b M\u012brz\u0101, Hind\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101 and all the ladies of the harem and shining stars\u2074 of the Khil\u0101fat and all the officers and servants who were absent from the dais received in accordance with their degree, jewels and rich varieties and also gold and silver money. Also to all the relatives and dependants, of his Majesty in Samarqand, Khur\u0101s\u0101n, K\u0101shgh\u0101r and \u1e6cr\u0101q, there were sent valuable gifts. Presents too were despatched to the holy sepulchres (ma\u1e63\u1e25\u0101hid) and blessed shrines in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, Samarqand, etc. And an order was issued that to every inhabitant of K\u0101bul, Saddara,\u2075 War\u0101sk, Kh\u016bst, and Badakhsh\u0101n, male and female,\n\n\u00b9 Saturday, Erakine (B\u0101bar, 334) says the date is wrong, for 29th Rajab was a Friday and suggests that the distribution of treasure on a Friday might have interfered with B\u0101bar\u2019s religious duties.

MSS. Add. Per. of B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs, viz., No. 24,416, p. 269b, and No. 26,200, p. 285a. The latter was used by Erskine and the passage is as follows:\n\nThere is nothing in either MS. about Badakhsh\u0101n or Kh\u016bst.\n\nThe explanation of their mention in the A.N. however seems to be that A.F. used Shaikh Zain\u2019s trs. of B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs. This was made much earlier than \u2018Abdu-r-rah\u012bm\u2019s for Shaikh Zain was one of B\u0101bar\u2019s courtiers and wrote for him the pompous firm\u0101ns given by B\u0101bar. (Ers., 355 and 359). He is also mentioned in the Akbarn\u0101ma (I, 119) as Shaikh Zain, the Sadr and grandson of Shaikh Zainu-d-d\u012bn Khw\u0101fi\n\n(Blochmann, 592n). There are two fragments of this translation in the B.M., viz., Add. No. 26,202 (Rieu, I, 246) and Or. No. 1999 (I. c. III, 926) Shaikh Zain\u2019s version is written in an ornate and rhetorical style and in the third person. Both fragments contain the transactions of 932 and both speak of Kh\u016bst or Khw\u0101st Badakhsh\u0101n in describing the sending of the sh\u0101hrukh\u012bs. The passage in Add. No. 26,202 occurs at 70a, and in Or. No. 1999 at 70b. It runs thus,\n\n\u201cAnd an order was passed that all the inhabitants of the capital (P K\u0101bul) and the dwellers in \u0160ada Dara\u0161k (or Warask) and Khust Badakhsh\u0101n, who were distinguished for religion and piety, should each get a sh\u0101hrukh\u012b.\u201d Apparently then, \u0160ada Dara\u0161k is some hamlet of Kh\u016bst in Badakhsh\u0101n. All the other B.M. MSS. of \u2018Abdu-r-rah\u012bm\u2019s trs. agree with the two already named in omitting any mention of Badakhsh\u0101n.\n\nThe Saddara of the Text might mean the hundred valleys and according to Steingass Dara is a district in Badakhsh\u0101n. \u0160ada is given by Vullers, on the authority of Notices et Extraits, (XIV, 771) as meaning a company of 100 men and possibly it may be the title of a divi-\nVerse.\n\nFrom the showering of the jewel-shedding hand,\nJoy burst out afresh in the world.\nPleasant is the gift that cometh from afar,\nAs the Moon sheds light on earth from her sphere.\n\nsion of a country, e.g., the English hundred. I can find no such district as Warsak or Versak but possibly Wakhsh or Vakhsh is meant. (T.R. N. E. & R. 263, and B\u0101bar, Ers. Intro. XXX).\n\n\"Kh\u016bst or Khost is a district on the northern slope of the Hind\u0101 K\u016bsh, between south and south-east of Kunduz and lies very near the hill tracts known on our time as K\u0101f\u012brist\u0101n.\" T.R., trs. 103n.). Kh\u016bst is given in Raverty's Pusht\u016b Dictionary, as a province in Afghanistan. (See B\u0101bar, Ers. 151, 268 and 270.) It lay in the west of Badakhsh\u0101n. Mr. Ney Elias' map marks it as north of C\u0101rik\u0101r and west-north-west of Citr\u0101l.\n\nOn the whole it appears that Erskine's rendering \"to excite emulation\" cannot be correct though he adheres to it in his B\u0101bar and Hum\u0101y\u016bn (I, 440) adding that perhaps B\u0101bar's object was to assist in recruiting his army, but Mr. Erskine had not then probably examined Shaikh Zain's translation. It appears to me that B\u0101bar's motive was rather to enable the people of Afghanistan to defend themselves against the Uzb\u0113gs and to strengthen their loyalty. It is probably to these presents that he alludes when he says (Ers. 310) that Badakhsh\u0101n, Kunduz, K\u0101bul and Qandah\u0101r were dependent on him, but that instead of being a help, he had to send extensive supplies to some of them, on account of their being near the enemy. This enemy can only mean the Uzb\u0113gs. I should note that the last \u016b of the Text, viz. that between Kh\u016bst, and Badakhsh\u0101n does not occur in all the MSS. Price (Retr. IV, 684) has \"at K\u0101bul and the neighbourhood.\" Fir\u016bzta too has nothing about Badakhsh\u0101n and merely speaks of the inhabitants of the city of K\u0101bul, adding that B\u0101bar received, on account of his improvidence, the title of Qalandar. Nor does Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n (Bib. Ind. I, 59) speak of Badakhsh\u0101n. B\u0101bar sought afterwards to recoup his extravagance by adding 30 per cent. to the taxes (Memoirs, 387).\n\nThere is still another trs. of B\u0101bar's Memoirs, that by M\u012brz\u0101 P\u0101yanda Hasan Ghaznavi and Mu\u1e25d. Quli Mughal \u1e24is\u0101ri. Rieu, II, 799b.\n\nSince writing the above note I have seen Wood's Journey to the Source of the Oxus (Lond. 1872) and am now inclined to think that \u1e62ada is a mistake for the Arabic \u1e63adda, a gate or pass. \u1e62ad or \u1e62adda seems a common name of places in Badakhsh\u0101n and in one of Wood's maps (p. XC) there is a pass marked Sad-\u012bsh-tragh or Ishtr\u0101kh which may be the \u1e62ada or \u1e62addara rassak of the Text. It is north of Citr\u0101l and perhaps recent expeditions to that neighbourhood, have thrown or will throw light on the locality mentioned in the Text. \u1e62ad seems to be used in Badakhsh\u0101n as equivalent to daru.\nIt is a fixed law that when the world-adorning Creator designs to reveal a unique jewel from its casings, he brings strange things to pass so that a man being tried in such ways by word and deed may become glorious in the minds of all for firmness and foreseeing. Among these, there was this strange circumstance that with all this victory and largesse, there was a defect of similitude (qillat-i-muj\u0101nasat) which worked a want of intimacy ('illat-i-'adam-i-muw\u0101nasat) with the people of India.\n\nThe soldiery and the peasantry (of India) abstained from intercourse (with the invaders). Although Delhi and Agra had come into possession, opponents held the country. Many of the neighbouring forts were held by rebels. Q\u0101sim Sanb\u0101l\u012b held Sanbal (Rohilkhand) and in the fort of B\u012b\u0101na (Bhartpur) Nig\u0101m Kh\u0101n was beating the drum of opposition. \u1e24asan Kh\u0101n Mew\u0101t\u012b had established himself in Mew\u0101t (south of Delhi) and raised the standard of revolt. Mu\u1e25ammad Zait\u016bn had established himself in Dh\u014dlp\u016br (Rajp\u016bt\u0101n\u0101) and was breathing opposition. T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n S\u0101rangkh\u0101n\u012b (Fir\u012bghta, son of S\u0101rang Kh\u0101n) was holding Gw\u0101li\u0101r; \u1e24ussain Kh\u0101n L\u014dh\u0101n\u012b, R\u0101pr\u012b (on the Jumna); Qu\u1e6db Kh\u0101n, Et\u0101wa, \u2018Al\u0101m Kh\u0101n, K\u0101lp\u012b. Margh\u016bb, a slave of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, held Mah\u0101wan (Mathur\u0101) which is near Agra. Qan\u0101nj and the other cities beyond the Ganges, were in the hands of the Afgh\u0101ns, under the headship of N\u016b\u1e63ir Kh\u0101n L\u014dh\u0101n\u012b and Ma\u02bfr\u016bf Farmul\u012b who had contended also with Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. After his death, they had acquired many other countries and having advanced some stages, had made Bah\u0101r Kh\u0101n, son of Dary\u0101 Kh\u0101n, king and styled him Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad.\u00b9\n\nDuring this year, while his Majesty had his head-quarters in Agra, the hot winds were very oppressive. An impure sam\u0101m and sickness were added to the pusillanimity of the camp. A large number absconded out of senseless imaginations. Owing to the rebels, the inclement weather, the impassableness of the roads, the delay of coming by merchants, there was distress for food and a want of necessary articles. The condition of the people became bad. Many officers resolved to leave Hind\u016bst\u0101n for K\u0101bul and its neighbourhood, and many soldiers deserted. Though many old officers and veteran soldiers used improper language in the Presence, and also secretly\n\n\u00b9 B. and H., Ers. I, 412.\nused language disagreeable to his Majesty, yet his Majesty Giti-\nsit\u0101ni who was unique for far-seeing and endurance, did not heed\nthis but set about the administration of the country. At length on\nthe part of the \u00e9lite and those who had been trained by his Majesty\nand from whom different things were to be looked for, there were\nstale movements of old times.\\footnote{The meaning is not clear, but I\nthink A.F. is sneering at the presumptuous ways of old servants, Cf.\ntext 133, seven lines from foot.} Especially was this the case\nwith Ahm\u0101di Parw\u0101nci and Wali Kh\u0101zin. Still more astonish-\ning, Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n B\u0113g,\u2014who in all the battle fields and occasions,\nespecially in the expedition to Hind\u016bst\u0101n, had always spoken gallantly\nand given such opinions as befitted a brave man\u2014now changed his\nviews and was the foremost in advocating the abandonment of the\ncountry, both openly and by covert hints. At length his Majesty\nsummoned his officers and spoke wise words of counsel to them,\nunveiling their secret imaginings (makht\u016br\u0101t) and forbidden (mahz\u016br\u0101t)\nideas. He announced his firm determination, saying, \u201cWe have\n\u201cwon this fine country by labour and hardship, to give it up for a\n\u201clittle fatigue and contrariety, is neither the way of world-conquerors\n\u201cnor method of wise men. Joy and sorrow, comfort and distress are\n\u201clinked together. Now that all those labours and troubles have\n\u201cbeen brought to their end, assuredly rest and smoothness will ap-\n\u201cpear in like degree. You must lay firm hold on the strong cable\n\u201cof reliance on God and not utter any more vain and factious words.\n\u201cWhoever has a mind to depart to K\u0101bul (Wil\u0101yat) and to exhibit\n\u201chis own worthlessness, it matters not, let him go. But we, relying\n\u201con the lofty courage which rests on the Divine help, have fixed\n\u201cIndia in our heart.\u201d At last all the officers, after consideration\nand meditation, agreed and confessed that what his Majesty said\nwas true and that \u201cthe king\u2019s word was the word-king.\u201d With\nheart and soul they placed the head of submission on the ground of\ncommand and bound themselves to remain. Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n who was\nkeener than the others about leaving for K\u0101bul (Wil\u0101yat) received\npermission to depart and the presents for the princes and others\nwere sent with him.\\footnote{He received money also for re-\npairing a reservoir at Ghazn\u012bu.

It is manifest that every right-minded, fortunate one who conducts business with subtle prudence, is more and more successful in proportion as he arrives at high positions. A mirror of this is the grand story of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101ni Fird\u016bsmak\u0101ni who in such a commotion of the soldiery and in presence of much opposition, had recourse to world-conquering courage, and who, relying on the Divine protection, set his face to accomplish his work and achieve his desires and made the city of Agra, which is the centre of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, his fixed residence and with strength of counsel and courage and abundant liberality and justice, composed the distractions of the country. Accordingly many of the officers of Hind\u016bst\u0101n and rulers of the country gradually entered his service. Among them was Shaikh Gh\u016bran who brought with him as many as 3,000 men of mark. Everyone of them received favours above his condition.\n\nThere were also Fir\u016bz Kh\u0101n, Shaikh B\u0101yazid, Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n L\u014dh\u0101n\u012b, Q\u0101zi Ji\u0101, who were amongst the famous sird\u0101rs, and who entered the service and obtained their desires. Fir\u016bz Kh\u0101n received a j\u0101gir from Jaunp\u016br of one kror odd of tankas. Shaikh B\u0101yazid one kror from Oudh; Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n 90 lakhs from Gh\u0101zip\u016br. Q\u0101zi Ji\u0101 had an assignment of 20 lakhs from Jaunp\u016br. In a short time, there was peace and comfort and joy and pleasure and such prosperity as belongs to a permanent government.

Sambal was assigned to Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, in addition to Sark\u0101r His\u0101r-fir\u016bza which formerly had been given him as the reward of valour. Am\u012br Hind\u016b B\u0113g was appointed as his deputy to preside over that district. As Biban had besieged the fort of Sambal, the aforesaid Am\u012br, K\u012bta B\u0113g, Malik Q\u0101sim, B\u0101b\u0101 Qashqa with his brothers and Mall\u0101 \u0100p\u0101q, Shaikh Gh\u016bran and his soldiers from the middle D\u016b\u0101b were rapidly sent there. Biban engaged them and was defeated and as that seditious and disloyal one (har\u0101m-nimak) after having experienced the sweets of service, had out of evil nature turned his back, never again did he behold fortune's face.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nDeliberations of His Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b (B\u0101bar) and Undertaking by Hum\u0101y\u016bn of the Expedition to the Eastward.\n\nAs his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b was now victoriously established in Agra, the capital of the kingdom, and as the rainy season,\u2014which is the spring of India and the period of freshness and verdure, of enjoyment with one's friends, and of garden delights,\u2014had passed away and the time for expeditions had arrived, he consulted with his ministers as to whether he should proceed to the east to quell the L\u014dh\u0101nis who had advanced with nearly 50,000 cavalry beyond Qanauj and were meditating hostilities, or should march westward against R\u0101n\u0101 S\u0101ng\u0101 and subdue him, as he was very strong and had recently got possession of the fort of Khand\u0101r and was cocking the cap of disobedience. After consultation, it was decided that as R\u0101n\u0101 Sang\u0101 had repeatedly sent representations to Kabul and had made protestations of loyalty, the facts of his not having done so since and of his having taken the fort of Khand\u0101r from Hasan, the son of Makan, who had not yet done homage,\u2014were not sufficient evidence of disloyalty, and that it was not advisable to proceed against him at present. The proper course was to send capable men to ascertain his dispositions and that until the truth about him was known, the first thing was to march eastwards and put down the L\u014dh\u0101nis. The Emperor intimated that he would attend to this matter in person, but meantime his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b,\u2014the plant of whose greatness had grown tall in the garden of hope,\u2014represented that if this weighty affair were committed to him, he would by the help of the royal fortune, bring it to a successful ter-\n\n1 Chalmers resumes his translation here after missing out from p. 112, p. 102 of the text.\n2 According to Tod, S\u0101ng\u0101 is a contraction of Sangr\u0101m Singh, \"the lion of battle.\"\n3 Kand\u0101r is a strong hill-fort a few miles east of Rantabhir.

The Emperor greatly approved of this request and gladly accepted the offer, and his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b girded himself for the task with energy and good fortune. Orders were issued that there should join themselves to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, \u2018\u0100dil Sult\u0101n, Mu\u1e25ammad K\u014dkul-t\u0101sh, Amir Sh\u0101h Man\u1e63\u016br Barlas, Amir Qatlaq Qadam, Amir \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h, Amir Wali, Amir J\u0101n B\u0113g, Pir Quli, Amir Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain,\u2014who had been deputed to take Dh\u014dlp\u016br and its neighbourhood from Mu\u1e25ammad Zait\u016bn and to make it over to Sult\u0101n Junaid Barlas and then to march against B\u012bn\u0101. For this purpose K\u0101buli Ahmad Q\u0101sim was despatched in all haste to direct these officers to meet Hum\u0101y\u016bn at Candw\u0101r.

On Thursday, 13 \u017dilq\u0101da (21st August, 1526) he came out from Agra at an auspicious moment and encamped at a distance of three kos from the city.

Having reduced Jaunp\u016br to order by justice and equity, he administered the country with the wisdom of age and the energy of youth.

His Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b named him Mu\u1e25ammad F\u0101r\u016bq.

The wondrous deeds of his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-s\u012bt\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b are an instance of this, for as his felicity increased so also did his wisdom, and in proportion as the causes of dizziness augmented, so also did his prudence become enhanced. He ever took refuge in the Divine Unity, and in the administration of justice and the management of State affairs, never deviated a hair's breadth from the highway of reason. And at this time when R\u0101n\u0101 S\u0101ng\u0101, in the pride of his numbers and courage and with his brains full of boastful madness, began to act presumptuously, and to remove his foot from the circle of equanimity, and was drawing nigh with the stride of boldness, he (B\u0101bar) made the favour of God his stronghold, and gave no admission to the attacks of dismay but proceeded to quell that ill-fated disturber of the Age.\n\nOn Monday, 9 Jum\u0101da-l-awwal (11th February, 1527), he marched out from Agra to extirpate this sedition, and pitched his camp in the neighbourhood of the city. Reports were continually arriving that the ill-fated one (R\u0101n\u0101 S\u0101ng\u0101) had attacked B\u012b\u0101na with a large army, and that the troops who had come out of that town, had not been able to withstand him and had turned back. Sankar Kh\u0101n Janj\u016bha was killed on that occasion, and Amir Kita B\u0113g\u00b9 wounded.

It occurred to him that there was no water-supply for the troops except in Sikri\u2014(which after returning thanks for his victory, his Majesty Giti-sitani, by giving diacritical points, named Shukri (thanksgiving) and which is now by the auspicious felicity of the king of kings, known as Fathpur, from its giving victory to hearts)\u2014and it might happen that the hostile army by using despatch, would get possession of this. In consequence of this just thought, he proceeded next day towards Fathpur and sent Amir Darvesh Muhammad Sarban in advance in order that he might find a proper ground for encampment. The said Amir fixed on an eligible spot in the neighbourhood of Fathpur Lake (Kul) which is a broad sheet of water and an ocean-like reservoir, and that was made the pleasant ground of encampment. From thence messengers went to summon Mahdi Khwaja and the other officers who were in Biana. Beg Mirak who was a servant of Jahangiri and a number of the Emperor's special attendants were sent to collect information. In the morning intelligence was brought that the opposing army had advanced one kos beyond Bisawar and were eighteen kos distant. On the same day Mahdi Khwaja, Muhammad Sultan Mirza and the other officers who had been in Biana, arrived and did homage. During this time, daily skirmishes took place between the outposts in which gallant soldiers distinguished themselves and received the royal approbation.\n\nAt length on Saturday, 13 Jumada-l-akhbar 933 (16th March, 1527), Rana Sanga advanced with a large army to a hill near the village of Khanwa in the Sarkar of Biana and about two kos from the imperial camp.\n\nHis Majesty states in his Memoirs that according to the Indian calculation by which territory yielding one lakh of revenue furnishes 100 horse, and one of a kror of revenue, 10,000 horse, the dominions\n\n---\n\n1 Possibly the grandfather of Nizamu-d-din Ahmad, the author of the Tabaqat.\n2 Babar's brother-in-law.

He was generally known as \u2018\u0100lam Kh\u0101n.\nHighness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and on his right were Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n, Ahmad Y\u016bsuf \u014cghl\u0101q\u016b, Hind\u016b B\u0113g Q\u0101c\u012bn, Khusr\u016b K\u014dkult\u0101sh, Qaw\u0101m B\u0113g, Urd\u016b-sh\u0101n, Wali Kh\u0101z\u012bn, Qaraq\u016bz\u012b, Pir Q\u016bli S\u012bst\u0101n\u012b, Khw\u0101ja Pahlw\u0101n Badakhsh\u012b, \u2018Abdu-l-shak\u016br and many other gallant men. On the victorious left of his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, were M\u012br Hama, Mu\u1e25ammad\u012b K\u014dkult\u0101sh, and Khw\u0101jag\u012b Asad J\u0101md\u0101r.\n\nAnd on the right wing there were nobles of India such as the Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, Dil\u0101war Kh\u0101n, Mulk\u0101d\u0101r Kar\u0101ran\u012b and Shaikh Gh\u016bran.\n\nOn the left wing were Sayyid Mahd\u012b Khw\u0101ja, Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n Mirz\u0101, \u2018\u0100dil Sult\u0101n, son of Mahd\u012b Sult\u0101n, \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018az\u012bz Mir Akh\u016br, Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b Jang Jang, Qatlaq Qadam Qar\u0101wal, Sh\u0101h Husain B\u0101r-b\u0113g\u012b, J\u0101n B\u0113g Atka. And of the nobles of India there were Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n and Kam\u0101l Kh\u0101n, sons of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn, \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n Shaikh-z\u0101da Farmul\u012b, N\u012bz\u0101m Kh\u0101n of Bi\u0101na and many other brave warriors who girt the waist of service with perfect loyalty. And as a flanking party, there were Tardi Ikka, Malk Q\u0101sim, brother of B\u0101b\u0101 Qushqa and many Mughals on the right wing. M\u016bman Atka and Rustam Turkam\u0101n with many of the Emperor\u2019s special dependants were stationed on the left wing.\n\nFor the sake of protection, the practise of the holy warriors of R\u016bm was followed and a line of carts was arranged and connected by chains so that there might be cover for the matchlock-men and cannoniers, who were in front of the soldiers,\u2014and N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn \u2018Al\u012b Khal\u012bfa was appointed to command this line. Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhsh\u012b, after arranging the commanders and officers in their posts, stood near the Emperor to hear his commands which were allied to Divine inspiration,\u2014and despatched adjutants (taw\u0101ci\u0101n) and couriers to all sides who conveyed the orders to the officers. When the pillars of the army had been arranged in this excellent manner, a command was issued that no one should stir without orders from his position, nor without permission advance his foot into the battle. A watch of the day had passed\u00b9 when the fire of war was kindled.\n\nVerse.\n\nThe soldiers bestirred themselves on each side,\nDay and night were commingled,\n\n\u00b9 About 9 A.M.\nOn each side arose a war-cry,\nTwo seas of hate foamed at the lips,\nThe steel-shod hoofs of the chargers\nReddened the ground with the blood of the brave.\nThe world-holder mid his glorious camp\nMoved exultant on his prancing steed.\n\nSuch a battle raged on the right and left wings that the earth quaked and the universe resounded with the clangour. The left wing of the enemy moved against the imperial right and fell upon Khusr\u016b K\u014dkult\u0101sh, Mulk Q\u0101sim and B\u0101b\u0101 Qushq\u0101. C\u012bn Tim\u016br Sult\u0101n was ordered to go to their assistance and by his intrepid aid he drove the enemy nearly to the rear\u00b9 of their centre. A noble reward was assigned to him for this. Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 R\u016bm\u012b brought forward the carts from the centre of his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s division and by his matchlocks and culverins (zarbzan) so broke up the ranks of the enemy that the rust was scoured off from the mirror-hearts of the brave combatants, and many of the enemy were laid level with the earth and were annihilated. And, as from time to time, the hostile troops advanced, so did his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b send on picked men to succour his victorious soldiers.\n\nAt one time orders were given to Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sult\u0101n, \u0100\u1e25mad Y\u016bsuf and Qaw\u0101m B\u0113g; at another to Hind\u016b B\u0113g Q\u016bc\u012bn; at another to Mu\u1e25ammad K\u014dkult\u0101sh and Khw\u0101jag\u012b Asad. After that Y\u016bnus \u2018\u0100li, Sh\u0101h Mans\u016br Barl\u0101s and \u2018Abdul-l-l\u0101h Kit\u0101bd\u0101r received orders. Then D\u014dst \u012ashak \u0100qa, Mu\u1e25ammad Khal\u012bl Akhta B\u0113gi were sent to assist. The enemy\u2019s right wing repeatedly attacked the left wing of the victorious army but every time the loyal souled Gh\u0101z\u012bs affixed some of them to the ground by a rain of calamitous arrows, and slew many of them with the lightning of daggers and scimitars. M\u016bman Atka and Rustam Turkam\u0101n acting according to orders, attacked the benighted bands from the rear, and Mull\u0101 Mahm\u016bd and \u2018\u0100li Atka B\u0101shliq who were servants of Khw\u0101ja Khalifa went to their assistance. Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, \u2018Adil Sult\u0101n, \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018az\u012bz Mir Akh\u016br, Qatlaq Qadam Qar\u0101wal, Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018\u0100li Jang Jang, Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain B\u0101rb\u0113gi and Mughal Gh\u0101nj\u012b engaged in action and maintained a firm position. Khw\u0101ja \u1e24usain went with a body of the household troops\n\n\u00b9 B\u0101bar, nearly to their centre.\n109 (diw\u0101ni\u0101n) to their assistance and all the victorious warriors,\u2014who with jeopardy of their lives devoted themselves to service,\u2014made lofty the standards of toil by taking vengeance on the enemy, and choked the springs of the enemy\u2019s hope with the dust of failure.\n\nVerse.\n\nThe hands\\(^1\\) of the javelin-throwers were knot upon knot (girih bar girih),\nThe backs of the brazen-bodied ones were cuirass upon cuirass (zirih bar zirih).\nOn each side, the rock-piercing spears\nClosed with thorns the path of safety.\nThe shining of caerulean scimitars\nDeprived eyes of sight by their gleaming.\nThe dust of the earth put a cap on the Moon\nAnd stopped the breath in the throat.\n\nAs the engagement was long, owing to the numbers of the enemy, orders were issued to the household troops, who were behind the carts like chained tigers,\u2014to emerge from the right and left centre and after leaving a space in the middle for the musketeers, to charge from both sides. In accordance with the noble call the gallant youths and valiant warriors, like tigers breaking from their chains and gaining their liberty, dashed forward. The clashing (cak\u0101c\u0101k) of swords and the whizzing (sh\u012bp\u0101sh\u0101p) of arrows reached the heavens, and that rare one of the Age, \u2018Ali Q\u016bl\u012b,\\(^2\\) stood with his following in front of the centre and performed wonders in discharging stones\\(^3\\) and in firing of culverins and muskets. Just then orders were issued for moving forward the carriages of the centre and his Majesty himself moved against the foe. When this was perceived by the glorious army, they became agitated like a billowy sea and all at once made an assault on the hostile ranks. At the end of the day the flame of conflict so blazed up that the right and left of the victorious army forced and drove the enfeebled left and right of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The meaning seems to be that the opposing soldiers were locked together in flight.

They approached very near but the high-minded Gh\u0101zis stood firm and quitted themselves like men. By heaven's help, the opponents were unable to abide the contest and those ill-fated, wretched ones were compelled to loose the rein of firmness from the palm of contrivance and to take flight and to regard as meritorious their escaping half-dead from such a courage-testing contest. The breezes of victory and success blew on the grove of fortunate standards, and the buds of strength and help blossomed on the branches of faith and exertion. Many of the hostile troops became the food of the blood-drinking sword and of the hawking arrow. And many wounded, the remains of the sword, turned the dust-stained cheek of courage, and the besom of dismay swept away the rubbish of their presence from the field of battle, quivering like moving sands, they became a Sahara of wretchedness.\n\nHasan Kh\u0101n M\u0113w\u0101t\u012b was killed by a bullet and R\u0101wal Uday Singh, M\u0101nik Cand C\u016bh\u0101n, R\u0101i Candrabh\u0101n Dilpat R\u0101i, Gang\u016b, Kram Singh, Rao Nagarsi\u00b9 and many of their great chiefs were slain. Many thousand wounded were destroyed by the hands and 'neath the swift feet of the victorious army. Mu\u1e25ammad Kokult\u0101sh, \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018az\u012bz Mir \u0100kh\u016br, \u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n and some others were sent to pursue R\u0101n\u0101 S\u0101ng\u0101.\n\nHis Majesty Giti-sit\u0101ni Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b having become victorious returned thanks for this great victory and sublime blessing to Almighty God, Glory be to His Name, (who arranges the series of fates by re-setting the openings and shuttings of things visible and invisible), and pursued the enemy for one kos from the field of battle, till at length night fell; that day was black for foes and that night joyful for friends. Then he recalled his lofty spirit from the enemy and beating high the drum of success, turned and reached his camp some hours after night-fall. As it was not ordained of God that that abandoned one (R\u0101n\u0101 S\u0101ng\u0101) should be taken, the men who were sent in pursuit of him, did not manage well. His Majesty observes thereon, \"The time was critical, I should have gone myself and not have trust-\n\n\u00b9 Tod, \"of Dangarp\u0101r.\"\n\u00b2 Text, D\u0101ngarsi.

His Majesty writes in his Memoirs that there was a similar coincidence in the chronograms of the former victory of Dip\u0101lpur when two persons found the date *Wasat-i-shahr-i-Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-awwal.*\u00b2\n\nWhen so great a victory had been gained, the pursuit of R\u0101n\u0101 S\u0101nga and the attack on his country were postponed and preference was given to the conquest of M\u0113w\u0101t. Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b Jang Jang, Shaikh Gh\u016bran and \u2018Abdu-l-Mul\u016bk Q\u016brc\u012b were sent with a large force against Ily\u0101s Kh\u0101n who had raised the head of sedition in K\u014dil\u00b3 in the D\u0101b\u0101b and had imprisoned Kacak \u2018Al\u012b the governor of that place. When the victorious army approached, he was unable to resist them and retired. After the victorious army had reached Agra, that rebel was produced before the royal Court and met with capital\u2074 punishment.\n\nAs the conquest of M\u0113w\u0101t had been determined upon by the world-adorning soul (of B\u0101bar), he proceeded to that province. On Wednesday, 6 Rajab (7th April, 1527), he arrived at Alwar which is the capital of M\u0113w\u0101t. The treasures of Alwar were bestowed on his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. And when this territory had been annexed, he returned to the capital in order to undertake the reduction of the eastern territories.\n\n**Departure of His Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b for Kabul and Badakhsh\u0101n, and the March of the Royal Army to Agra.**\n\nAs it was necessary to arrange for the administration of Kabul and Badakhsh\u0101n, and as the time was exigent, and as Badakhsh\u0101n had been committed to Hum\u0101y\u016bn since 917\u2075 (1511) when M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The letters make 933.\n\u00b2 The letters make 930.

In 917, Hum\u0101y\u016bn was only three or four years old, and in the T. R. (353) we have an account of M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n as reigning in Badakhsh\u0101n in 924.\nhad died, and as many servants were employed there, his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, ornament of world-subduing, jewel of the sword of fortune, forehead of glory, frontispiece of splendour and glory, preamble of an incomparable model, pupil of the eyes of sovereignty and the Khil\u0101fat, the father of victory (ab\u016b-n-na\u1e63r), Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Hum\u0101y\u016bn was, on 9th Rajab of this auspicious (hum\u0101y\u016bn-f\u0101l) year (11th April, 1527), at 3 kos from Alwar despatched to that country. At the same time, the Emperor swiftly applied himself to the reduction of Biban Afgh\u0101n who during the R\u0101n\u0101\u2019s disturbance had besieged Lakhnaw and taken possession of it. Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n, Malik Q\u0101sim B\u0101b\u0101 Qashqa, Ab\u016b\u2019l-Mu\u1e25ammad Niz\u0101b\u0101z, \u1e24usain Kh\u0101n, and\u2014from among the Amirs of India,\u2014\u2018Al\u012b Kh\u0101n Farmuli, Mulk\u0101d\u0101d Karar\u0101n\u012b, T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n and Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n were sent along with Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n Mirz\u0101 against him. That luckless one, on hearing of the approach of the glorious army, left all his goods behind him, and fled with naught but the coin of life in his palm. His Majesty at the end of this year, visited Fathp\u016br (Sikri) and B\u0101r\u012b\u00b9 and then proceeded to Agra. In 934 he visited Koil and went from thence to Sambal\u00b2 to hunt, and after viewing these delightful Highlands, returned to the capital. On 28th \u0160afar (23rd Nov.) Fakhrjah\u0101n B\u0113gam\u00b3 and\n\nAccording to P. de C.\u2019s fragment of B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem. (II. 452) M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n did not die till 934. This must be wrong, for B\u0101bar speaks of Badakhsh\u0101n as belonging to himself at the time (932) of his conquest of India, and it is plain that M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n was not alive after 927. (B\u0101bar, Ers. 286 and note.) Most probably he died in 926, as Fir\u016bghta says and as is in accordance with Haidar M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s statement (Elias & Ross 387) that Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s reign in Badakhsh\u0101n began in 926. The events of this year, with the exception of those of the first month, are not recorded in B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs which are blank for the six years from \u0160afar 926 to 932. Gulbadan does not give any precise date for the death but says that ambassadors from Badakhsh\u0101n brought the news about the time of the Bajaur campaign. Apparently they brought Sulaim\u0101n, M\u012brz\u0101 Kh\u0101n\u2019s young son, with them. Gulbadan says that thereupon, B\u0101bar sent Hum\u0101y\u016bn to Badakhsh\u0101n and she adds the interesting circumstance that B\u0101bar and Maham (Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s mother) followed him there and stayed a few days.\n\n\u00b9 In Dh\u014dlp\u016br, R\u0101jp\u016bt\u0101n\u0101 and 44 miles south-west of Agra.\n\u00b2 Or Sambhal.

On the morning of Wednesday, 7th Jum\u0101da\u2019l-awwal (29th Jan., 1528), a splendid victory was gained at Cand\u0113r\u012b. Fath-i-d\u0101ru-l-harb (Conquest of the hostile country, i.e., of the country of the infidels = 934) is the chronogram of this Divine aid. After this Cand\u0113r\u012b was made over to Ahmad Sh\u0101h, grandson of Sult\u0101n Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn and then the Emperor returned on Sunday, 11th Jum\u0101da\u2019l-awwal (2nd Feb.).\n\nIt has been stated by trustworthy annalists that the R\u0101n\u0101 (S\u0101ng\u0101) had meditated revolt and been collecting an army before the Emperor marched against Cand\u0113r\u012b, and that when the former came to \u012arij,\u00b2 \u0100f\u0101q,\u00b3 a servant of his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b, had put it into a condition of defence. That black-fated one came and besieged the place, but one night he beheld in a dream an ancestor of his under a dreadful appearance. He awoke in terror and horror and began to tremble in all his limbs. After this he immediately set about his return and on the way, the forces of death attacked him and he died. The victorious army crossed the river of Burh\u0101np\u016br and it came to the ears of the Emperor that Ma\u2019r\u016bf, Biban and B\u0101yaz\u012bd had gathered their forces and that the imperial servants had abandoned Kanauj and come to R\u0101ber\u012b and that the enemy had taken the fort of Shams-\u0101b\u0101d from Ab\u016b\u2019l-mu\u1e25ammad Nizab\u0101z. Accordingly the reins of resolution were turned to that quarter and a number of heroes were sent on in advance. Merely on seeing the soldiers, the son of Ma\u2019r\u016bf became dumbfounded and fled from Kanauj; and Biban, B\u0101yaz\u012bd and Ma\u2019r\u016bf having heard of the royal army, crossed the Ganges and re-\n\n\u00b9 Jarrett II, 196.

The royal army continued to advance and on Friday, 3rd Muharram, 935 (18th Sept., 1528), Mirz\u0101 \u2018Askar\u012b who had been sent for from K\u0101bul before the Cand\u0113ri disturbance, to advise (with the Emperor) on the affairs of Mult\u0101n, arrived and entered upon auspicious service. On Friday next, the \u0100\u1e63\u0101r\u016bra, (10th Muharram) his Majesty halted at Gw\u0101ly\u0101r and next morning surveyed the palaces of Bikram\u0101jit and M\u0101n Singh and then proceeded towards the capital. He arrived there on Thursday, 25th Muharram.\n\nOn Monday, 10th Rab\u012b\u2018-u-l-awwal, couriers arrived from his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b in Badakhsh\u0101n and brought several pieces of good news. It was written that a son had been born to his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b by the chaste daughter of Y\u0101dg\u0101r Tagh\u0101i and that he had received the name of Al-am\u0101n. As this name was equivocal and had an improper meaning among the generality, it was not approved of. It was not acceptable also because it had not received the assent of his (B\u0101bar\u2019s) holy heart. The pleasing of the father, especially such a father and such a king, is fruitful of blessings, visible and invisible, and the displeasing of him is the cause of a hundred evils, external and internal. What marvel then if men of experience regard the rapid disappearance of this first fruits of sovereignty as a mark of this displeasure.\n\nWhen his Majesty had been settled in the capital, he convened the Turki and Indian nobles and had a splendid feast and held a consultation about the settlement of the eastern districts and the extinguishing of the flame of rebellion. After much discussion it was agreed, that before his Majesty took the field, Mirz\u0101 \u2018Askar\u012b should be sent to the east with a large force and that when the trans-Gangetic Am\u012brs had joined him with their forces, some great expedition might be undertaken. In accordance with this determination, Mirz\u0101\n\n---\n\n1 Al-am\u0101n, in Arabic, means peace or protection; also the protected one, the trusty. But B\u0101bar did not like the name because people in general pronounce it alaman or ilaman, and these words in Turk\u012b have bad meanings, viz., alaman is a plunderer or runner, and ilaman, \u201cI do not feel.\u201d (P. de C. II, 363n. See also Dicts. s. v.) B\u0101bar\u2019s objections to the name are given in his letter to Hum\u0101y\u016bn (Ers., 391). Besides the ambiguity mentioned above, he objected because it was unusual to place the article al thus before a name.\n'Askari departed on Monday, 7th Rab\u012b\u2018u-l-\u0101khar, while the Emperor himself went for a visit and for hunting towards Dh\u016blp\u016br.\n\nOn 3rd Jum\u0101da\u2019l-awwal news came that Mahm\u016bd,\u00b9 the son of Iskandar, had taken Bih\u0101r and was raising the head of rebellion. His Majesty returned from hunting to Agra and it was settled that he should proceed in person to the eastern districts.\n\nAt this time, couriers came from Badakhsh\u0101n with the intelligence that his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had collected the troops of those provinces and accompanied by Sult\u0101n Wais,\u00b2 had set out with 40 or 50 thousand men on an expedition against Samarkand. It was also reported that there was talk of a peace. In an auspicious moment a message was sent that, if the time for negotiations had not passed, he should make peace until the affairs of India had been cleared off. The letter also summoned Hind\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101 and mentioned that K\u0101bul was to be a royal domain. He (B\u0101bar) also wrote \u201cGod willing, when the affairs of Hind\u016bst\u0101n which are near settlement, shall be finished, we shall leave these faithful servants and ourselves visit our hereditary kingdoms. It is proper\u00b3 that all the servants of these countries should make preparations for the expedition and await the arrival of the imperial army.\u201d (B\u0101bar\u2019s)\n\nOn Thursday, the 17th of the said month, he crossed the Jumna and went towards the eastern districts.\n\nIn these days the ambassadors of Nu\u1e63rat Sh\u0101h,\u2074 the ruler of Bengal, brought valuable presents and did homage.\n\n\u00b9 Brother of the Ibr\u0101h\u012bm slain at P\u0101n\u012bpat.\n\u00b2 Ers., B. & H., I. 509. He was an Am\u012br of Khatl\u0101n (T.R. 21n.) and is often called Sult\u0101n Awais or Uwais. He was Sulaim\u0101n\u2019s father-in-law. (Blochmann, 311.) B\u0101bar refers to him in a letter to Hum\u0101y\u016bn (392). Apparently he was at one time king of Sw\u0101t. (B\u0101bar, Ers., 249).\n\u00b3 In this and other passages of this chapter, describing the events of 935, A.F.\u2019s abstract agrees with P. de C.\u2019s trs. (Vol. II.) rather than with Ers. The meaning is not clear in the text, but seems to be that the army to be awaited is B\u0101bar\u2019s. The corresponding passage occurs in a letter to Hum\u0101y\u016bn (P. de C. II, 456) and refers to B\u0101bar\u2019s desire that all his subjects should assist Hum\u0101y\u016bn in his projected expedition against the Uzb\u0113gs. P. de C. has, \u201cEn attendant, il est n\u00e9cessaire que tous nos sujets se joignent \u00e0 Humaiun dans cette exp\u00e9dition et le servent avec fid\u00e9lit\u00e9.\u201d\n\u2074 Son of \u2018Al\u0101\u2018u-d-d\u012bn Husain Sh\u0101h. B\u0101bar has a short notice of him (Ers., 311). He was also called Na\u1e63\u012br and apparently reigned 1518\u20131532.\nOn Monday, 19th Jum\u0101da\u2019l-akhar, M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Askar arrived on the banks of the Ganges and tendered his duty. He was ordered to march with his army down the opposite bank of the river. Near Karr\u0101 news came of the defeat of Mahm\u016bd Kh\u0101n, the son of Sult\u0101n Sikandar. Having advanced near the borders of Gh\u0101zip\u016br, he stopped at Bh\u014djp\u016br and Bih\u0101ya. In that place Bih\u0101r was bestowed on M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n. On Monday, 5th Ramaz\u0101n, being set at ease with regard to Bengal and Bih\u0101r, he proceeded to Sirw\u0101r to put down Biban and Bayazid. The enemy engaged with the victorious army and was defeated. After visiting Kharid and Sikandarp\u016br and being satisfied with the state of things there, he rode post towards Agra which he reached in a short space of time.\n\nHis Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-ashiy\u0101n\u012b had spent one year pleasurably in Badakhsh\u0101n. Suddenly a desire for the society of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101ni,\u2014who was a world of internal and external perfections,\u2014took possession of him and being unable to restrain himself, he made over Badakhsh\u0101n to Sult\u0101n Wais, the father-in-law of M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n, and proceeded towards the Qibla of fortune and Ka\u2019ba of hopes. Thus in one day he arrived at K\u0101bul. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n had come there from Qandah\u0101r. They met in the \u2018\u012adg\u0101h and\n\n---\n\n1 42 miles north-west of All\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d and in All\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d district.

(Ers., 419).\n5 So in Text, but in Mem. (Ers., 419) instead of Sirw\u0101r, we have the river Sarj\u016b or Gogra mentioned and are told that B\u0101bar marched from his station on its banks to put down the rebels. But A.F. is nearly in accord with P. de C. II, 456, where B\u0101bar says that on Thursday, 7th Ramaz\u0101n, he marched towards Sirw\u0101r to repulse Biban and Bayazid. Sirw\u0101r is also mentioned in Mem. (Ers. 420) and appears in the list of B\u0101bar\u2019s provinces. (Ers., B. & H., I. 541). See Blochmann, 381n. where it is stated that Sirw\u0101r got its name from the river Sarwa.\n6 In Jaunp\u016br. Jarrett II, 163 and 164.\n7 Probably because his family had just arrived from K\u0101bul. He met M\u0101ham, his favourite wife and Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s mother at midnight on Sunday, 27th June, 1529.\n8 P. de C. (II, 457) has \u201clors des c\u00e9r\u00e9monies du Bair\u0101m.\u201d Probably K\u0101mr\u0101n came there for this festival. There are two Bair\u0101ms (Vullers s.v.), one on 1st Sh\u0101wwal and one on\nK\u0101mr\u0101n being surprised to see him, asked him the cause of his journey. Hum\u0101y\u016bn replied it was a desire to see his sovereign, and that though he was always seeing him with his mind\u2019s eye, yet this was not equal to a personal interview. He ordered M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l to proceed from K\u0101bul for the protection of Badakhsh\u0101n and putting the foot of purpose in the stirrup of courage, and urging along the charger of joy on the highway of determination, he in a short time reached Agra and was rewarded by tendering his service.\n\nA wonderful thing was that his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b was sitting at table and talking with his (Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s) mother about him when suddenly\u00b9 the shining star emerged from the ascension-point of Badakhsh\u0101n. Their hearts were rejoiced and their eyes brightened.\n\nEach day of princes is a feast but that day, by the advent of his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, was made a feast such as cannot be described.\n\nM\u012brz\u0101 Haidar writes\u00b2 in his T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-rash\u012bd\u012b that his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b came to Hind\u016bst\u0101n in 935 (1528\u201329) at the summons of his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b and that he left Faqr \u2018Al\u012b in Badakhsh\u0101n.\n\nAt this time the darling (lit. eye-pupil) of the Sul\u1e6d\u0101nate, M\u012brz\u0101\n\n\u00b9 We are not told the date of his arrival but as he was at K\u0101bul during the Bair\u0101m and reached Agra in a few days (B\u0101bar, P. de C. II, 457) he probably arrived at end of August, 1529. His mother had come about two months before, for B\u0101bar met her on Sunday night, 27th June. She had been six months on the journey.\n\n\u00b2 T.R., E. & R., 387. Ers. (B. & H., I. 508) has given good reason for doubting the statement. Very probably Hum\u0101y\u016bn gave out that his father had sent for him and Haidar, who was in Badakhsh\u0101n shortly afterwards, may have recorded what he heard then.\n\n10th Z\u012b-l-hijja. Probably the latter is meant. On the other hand B\u0101bar (Ers., 428) seems to imply that Hum\u0101y\u016bn was at Agra on 8th July, 1529. If so the Bair\u0101m referred to must have been that of 1st Shaww\u0101l (June 8th) and Hum\u0101y\u016bn must have reached Agra at about the same time as his mother. This too would harmonize with A.F.\u2019s story that he appeared all of a sudden when his father and mother were talking of him. It agrees better too with Haidar\u2019s statement that Sa\u2018id Kh\u0101n left K\u0101shgh\u0101r for Badakhsh\u0101n in the beginning of Mu\u1e25arram 936 (Sept. 1529). If Hum\u0101y\u016bn only left Badakhsh\u0101n in the middle of August, there was hardly time for the Badakhsh\u012bs to send to Sa\u2018id Kh\u0101n for help and for him to get his army together by the beginning of September. Ac-\nAnwar had just died and his Majesty was deeply grieved on that account. The coming of his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was therefore a great comfort to his heart. His Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b remained for a while in attendance on him and the Emperor many times declared that Hum\u0101y\u016bn was an incomparable companion. In fact the name of Ins\u0101n-i-k\u0101mil (Perfection of Humanity) might well be applied to that majestic one. When he left Badakhsh\u0101n for India, Sult\u0101n Sa\u02bfid Kh\u0101n, who was the Kh\u0101n of K\u0101shghar and was related to his Majesty and who, moreover, had been in his service and had received favours and instruction from him,\u2014being stimulated to crude imaginations by messages from Sult\u0101n Vais and other Am\u012brs of Badakhsh\u0101n, left Rash\u012bd Kh\u0101n (his son) in Y\u0101rkand and marched against Badakhsh\u0101n. Before he arrived there M\u012brz\u0101 Hindal had reached Badakhsh\u0101n and established himself in Qil\u02bfa \u0179afar. Sa\u02bfid Kh\u0101n besieged the\n\n1 Gulbadan calls him Al\u016br or Alwar Mirz\u0101 and he appears in her list as the youngest child of her own mother, Dild\u0101r B\u0113gam. He must have been quite a child when he died in 1529, for his elder sister Gulbadan was only eight when B\u0101bar died in December 1530. She describes Al\u016br\u2019s illness and death. He was born at K\u0101bul. B\u0101bar says (Ers. 250) that several children were born to him in 925 (1519) but none of them lived. See in P. de C. (II. 45) a paragraph on this subject which is not in Ers. Its language causes confusion about the birth of Hind\u0101l for it would appear from B\u0101bar (Ers. 250 and P. de C. II. 45) that he was born in 925. But if so, how could B\u0101bar make over the infant to his mother (P. de C., II. 46) who had died in 911. The explanation is that there is a mistake in P.deC.\u2019s trs., and that the child was made over to Ma\u1e25am, B\u0101bar\u2019s wife, and not to his mother and thus became at once a son to B\u0101bar and a brother to Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\n2 B\u0101bar\u2019s cousin, being the son of Sult\u0101n A\u1e25mad, the brother of B\u0101bar\u2019s mother. He was indebted to B\u0101bar for hospitality at K\u0101bul and for the government of Far\u1e21h\u0101na (Mems., Ers. 217). It was B\u0101bar who suggested to Sa\u02bfid Kh\u0101n that he should call his son \u2018Abdu-r-rah\u012bd. (T. R., E. & R., 140). The account of Sa\u02bfid\u2019s raid into Badakhsh\u0101n is given in the T. R., 887. It began at the commencement of 936 (about 5th September 1529; l. c. 888).\n\n3 The old capital of Badakhsh\u0101n. It was on the K\u014dkca and was built by one Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h about the beginning of the 16th century. He called it Qil\u02bfa-zafar on account of a victory which he gained there over the Uzb\u0113gs and because he belonged to the Mu\u1e93affar tribe (qu. the Ahl-i-mu\u1e93affar of \u1e6cim\u016br\u2019s day?) The ruins of the fort still exist but the modern capital is Faiz\u0101b\u0101d. (T. R. 220 and n.) The old name of Qil\u02bfa-zafar was Sh\u0101fi-tiwar, (B\u0101bar, Ers. 167).\nfort for three months and then returned, re infected to K\u0101shghar. His Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b heard that the K\u0101shgharis had taken possession of Badakhsh\u0101n and he directed Khw\u0101ja Khalifa to go and put the affairs of that country in order. But the Khw\u0101ja in his folly delayed to obey. Then his Majesty asked Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b who by his fortune had come to reside with his Majesty,\u2014what he thought about going there himself. He represented in reply, that he had suffered affliction by being debarred from the blessing of his Majesty\u2019s presence, and had vowed that he would never again voluntarily exile himself but that there was no help for it, if he were ordered to go.\n\nAccordingly Mirz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n was despatched to Badakhsh\u0101n and a letter written to Sult\u0101n Sa\u2019id saying, \u201cConsidering my numerous claims on your consideration, this affair seems strange; I have recalled Hind\u0101l Mirz\u0101 and have sent Sulaim\u0101n. If you have any regard for hereditary rights, you will be kind to Sulaiman and leave him in possession of Badakhsh\u0101n, for he is as a son to us both. This would be well. Otherwise I, having given up my responsibility, will place the inheritance in the hands of the heir. The rest you know.\u201d\n\n1 B\u0101bar says (Ers. 217) \u201cSult\u0101n Sa\u2019id Kh\u0101n, the Kh\u0101n of K\u0101shghar\u201d (he was not so then which shows that B\u0101bar did not write his Memoirs year by year) \u201ccame to me with five or six naked followers on foot. I received them like my own brothers and gave him the Tum\u0101n of Mandr\u0101ur.\u201d\n\n2 I have substituted Mr. Ross\u2019 trs. (T.R., 389) for A.F.\u2019s abstract. The meaning of the last sentence in the letter, is more clearly brought out by Ers.\u2019 paraphrase (B. & H. I. 512) \u201cIf not,\u201d (i.e., if Sult\u0101n Sa\u2019id did not yield), \u201cthe Emperor, having resigned to him (Sulaim\u0101n) his own claims, would know how to support him against the pretensions of others.\u201d It seems evident that Ers. is right (508) in rejecting Haidar M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s statement that Hum\u0101y\u016bn left Badakhsh\u0101n in obedience to his father\u2019s commands. Perhaps he is confounding 935 with 932, when B\u0101bar summoned Hum\u0101y\u016bn to help him in the conquest of India. It is clear that Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s abrupt departure in 935, deranged B\u0101bar\u2019s project of reconquering his ancestral kingdom and also that it led to disasters in Badakhsh\u0101n. But B\u0101bar was probably too near his end and too fond of Hum\u0101y\u016bn to quarrel with him for leaving his post and coming to Agra. As Ers. remarks, the visit was probably arranged between Hum\u0101y\u016bn and his mother. See P. de C. II. 457, for the passage which A.F. must have had before him.\nBefore Mirz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n had reached K\u0101bul,1 Badakhsh\u0101n had been freed from the oppression of evil-thoughted men and been made an abode of peace, as has been already stated. When he arrived at Badakhsh\u0101n, Hind\u0101l in accordance with orders (from B\u0101bar) made over the country to him and proceeded to India.\n\nAfter some time spent in attendance, his Majesty sent his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni to Sambal2 which was his fief (j\u0101g\u012br). He remained happily there for six months and then was suddenly attacked by fever. The malady gradually increased and his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b, growing disturbed at the alarming news, ordered, in his affection for him, that he be brought to Delhi and thence by water to Agra, in order that he might be treated by skilful physicians under the Emperor\u2019s own eyes. A large number of learned doctors who were always in attendance at the royal Court, were directed to employ their talents in effecting a cure. In a short space of time, he was conveyed by boat. Though physicians used their skill and exhibited Messiah-like science, he did not get better. As the sickness was prolonged, the Emperor one day was seated with the wise men of the Age by the Jumna and considering about remedies. Mir Ab\u016b Baq\u01013 who was one of the most distinguished saints of the Age, represented that it had been received from the ancient sages, that in a case like this, when physicians were at a loss, the remedy was to give in alms the most valuable thing one had and to seek cure from God. His Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b said, \u201cI am the most valuable thing that Hum\u0101y\u016bn possesses; than me he has no better thing; I shall make myself a sacrifice for him. May God the Creator accept it.\u201d\n\nKhw\u0101ja Khalifa and the other courtiers represented that Hum\u0101y\u016bn would, by the grace of God, recover and attain to the limit of his\n\n---\n\n1 Meaning that Sa\u02bfid Kh\u0101n had already retreated. Mr. Ney Elias (389n) supposes that K\u0101bul is a mistake in the T.B. for Badakhsh\u0101n, but no correction seems needed, for Sulaim\u0101n would go by K\u0101bul from India to Badakhsh\u0101n. (Price IV. 715) Sulaim\u0101n was then 16, having been born in 920 (1514). In the passage already referred to, (P. de C. II. 457) \u201cSulaim\u0101n\u201d must be a mistake for Sult\u0101n Wais and the meaning be that the latter was Sulaim\u0101n\u2019s father-in-law.\n\n2 In the Murad\u0101b\u0101d district; north of Agra and east of Delhi. It was given to Hum\u0101y\u016bn in fief in 1526 (B\u0101bar, Ers., 338).\n\n3 T.R. (E. & R.) 478. He was apparently related to Khw\u0101ja Khw\u0101nd Mahm\u016bd also called Khw\u0101ja N\u016bra.\nnatural life under the shadow of his Majesty's fortune. Why had such an expression come from his tongue? The meaning of the saying of the great men of old was that the most valuable article of property should be given in charity, consequently the priceless diamond which had in a mysterious way been obtained in the war with Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and had been presented to Hum\u0101y\u016bn, should be sacrificed. He replied, \"What value has worldly wealth? and how can it be a redemption for Hum\u0101y\u016bn? I myself shall be his sacrifice. He is in extremity and I have lost the power (t\u0101qat) to behold his powerlessness (b\u012b-t\u0101qat\u012b), but I can endure all his pain.\" Thereafter he retired to his oratory and having performed such special rites as befitted the occasion, he thrice walked round his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101ghiy\u0101n\u012b. When his prayer had been heard by God,\u2014Glory be to His name!\u2014he felt a strange effect on himself and cried out, \"We have borne it away. We have borne it away.\" Immediately a strange heat of fever surged upon his Majesty and there was a sudden diminution of it in the person of his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. Thus in a short time he entirely recovered, while Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b gradually grew worse and the marks of dissolution and death became apparent.\n\nThen out of his active mind and truth-seeking soul, he summoned his officers and nobles and making them place the hands of homage\u00b9 to the empire (Khil\u0101fat) in the hands of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, appointed him his heir and successor, placing him on the throne of sovereignty, while he himself remained bed-ridden (s\u0101hib-i-far\u0101d) at the foot of the throne. Khw\u0101ja Khal\u012bfa, Qambar \u2018Al\u012b B\u0113g, Tardi B\u0113g, Hind\u016b B\u0113g, and all the others were in attendance.

R. (E. & R.) 307, 357, 422. He belonged to a family of B\u0101rki and was a son of M\u012br K\u0101ka also called, apparently, Amir Q\u0101sim Kucin.

And he exclaimed \"The cream of our testament\u2014ary directions is this, 'Do naught against your brothers even though they may deserve it.'\" In truth it was owing to his observing the mandates of the Emperor that his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b suffered so many injuries from his brothers without avenging himself, as will clearly appear from this history.\n\nWhen his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b was at the height of his disorder, M\u012br Khalifa took a short-sighted view\u2014as is the nature of mankind\u2014and from a suspicion that he entertained about his Highness Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b wished to place Mahdi Khw\u0101ja on the throne.\u00b9 The Khw\u0101ja too, from his evil disposition and wickedness and folly, gave way to vain thoughts and coming every day to the Darb\u0101r, made a disturbance. At last by the intervention of right-speaking, far-sighted men, M\u012br Khalifa was brought to the true path and passing from such thoughts, forbade the Khw\u0101ja to appear at the Darb\u0101r, and also prohibited anyone from visiting him. Thus, by the Divine aid, things came to their own place, and Right was fixed in its own centre.\n\nHe (B\u0101bar) left this world on 6th Jum\u0101da\u2019l-awwal,\u00b2 937, in the 118 Cah\u0101rb\u0101gh, on the banks of the Jumna in Agra. The eloquent of the Age composed chronograms and elegies about his Majesty. Among them was this chronogram by Maul\u0101n\u0101 Shih\u0101b Mu\u2018amm\u0101t\u012b (the Enigmatist).\n\nVerse.\n\nHum\u0101y\u016bn becomes his kingdom\u2019s heir.\u00b3\n\nIt would be impossible even if volumes were employed to detail the perfections of this Holy One.

Perhaps M\u012br Khalifa was afraid of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s addiction to opium (T. R. E. & R. 469). Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s sudden leaving his post in Badakhsh\u0101n must have given the old man a bad opinion of him.\n\n\u00b2 Firightsa, Monday, 5th Jum\u0101da\u2019l-awwal (21st December, 1530).

He held high rank as a poet and a prose-writer, and especially in Turki poetry. The Turki d\u012bw\u0101n\u00b9 (d\u012bw\u0101n-i-turk\u012b) of his Majesty is of great eloquence and purity, and its contents are charming. His book of Ma\u1e63nav\u012b which has the name of Mub\u012bn\u00b2 (clear) is a famous composition and is mentioned with great applause by critics. He versified the Ris\u0101la-i-w\u0101l\u012bd\u012bya\u00b3 of Khw\u0101ja Ahrar which is a pearl from the ocean of knowledge, and very excellent it was. He also wrote his Acts (W\u0101q\u012b\u02bfat) from the beginning of his reign to the time of departure with fidelity and in a lucid and eloquent style. It is an Institute for all earthly sovereigns and a manual for teaching right thoughts and proper ideas. This Institute of dominion and fortune was, by the world-obeyed commands of the king of kings, translated into Persian by Mirz\u0101 Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101n-kh\u0101n\u0101n, son of Bairam Kh\u0101n, in the 34th year of the Divine Era, at the time of the return of the standards of glory from the roseate vernal abode of Kashm\u012br and K\u0101bul, so that its exquisite bounties might moisten the lips of all the\n\n\u00b9 Probably A.

It was in Persian and Erskine says he has never met with it. According to Badshah (L. 348) it was a versified treatise on Mu\u1e25ammadan law or Theology according to the \u1e24anaf\u012b school and Shaikh Zain wrote a commentary on it which he called Mub\u012bn. See also Dr. Banking's translation, 450. There are two excellent articles on B\u0101bar and Ab\u016b'l-fa\u1e63l by Dr. Tempel in the Z. D. M. G. In one he mentions that a poem by B\u0101bar has been published by Ilminsky.\n\n\u00b3 B\u0101bar, Ers., 388 and P. de C., II. 358. The W\u0101l\u012bd\u012bya or Wal\u012bd\u012bya was a treatise in honour of Khw\u0101ja Ahrar's parents. B\u0101bar put it into verse about two years before his death, in hopes that the Khw\u0101ja (then dead) would cure him of his fever, in the same way as the author of a Qa\u1e63\u012bda had been cured of his paralysis. The trs. differ here. P. de C. says it was Sharafu-d-d\u012bn al-B\u016bs\u012br\u012b, the author of the Borda, who was cured. He wrote an Arabic poem in praise of Mu\u1e25ammad and died in 694 (1294-5). But if the cure was effected by the Khw\u0101ja, it must have been for another Sharafu-d-d\u012bn, possibly of Bukh\u0101r\u012b.\nthirsty and that its hidden treasures might be beheld by those whose hands were empty of learning.\n\nHis Majesty was also eminently skilled in music and composed charming verses in Persian. Among them the following quatrain is a product of his bounteous muse.\n\nVerse.\u00b9\n\nThough I be not related to dervishes,\nYet am I their follower in heart and soul.\nSay not a king is far from a dervish;\nI am a king but yet the slave of dervishes.\n\nThe following two Ma\u1e6dla\u02bf are also sparkles from his enlightened mind.\n\nMa\u1e6dla\u02bf I.\n\nParting from thee were perdition,\nElse could I depart from this world.\n\nMa\u1e6dla\u02bf II.\n\nWhilst my heart is bound with her cypress locks,\nI am free from the griefs of the world.\n\nHis Majesty was also famous for treatises on prosody, and among them is a book called Mu\u1e25assal which is a commentary on the science.\n\nHis Majesty left four sons and three daughters:\u2014(1) His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Hum\u0101y\u016bn P\u0101dsh\u0101h, (2) K\u0101mr\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, (3) \u2018Askar\u012b M\u012brz\u0101, (4) Hind\u0101l M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nThe daughters were:\u2014Gulrang B\u0113gam; Gulcihra B\u0113gam; Gulbadan B\u0113gam, all three by one mother.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 I have in part copied Ers.\u2019 trs.

According to Gulbadan, her father had eighteen children, all of whom were born at K\u0101bul except two daughters, born at Kh\u014dst. Apparently she does not reckon the Fakhru-n-nis\u0101, who was born at Samarqand and lived only some 40 days. Her list is as follow:\n   I.

M\u012br Ab\u016b-l-baq\u0101 who was of lofty rank in learning and wisdom.\n\n(2). Shaikh Zain \u0160adr, grandson of Shaikh Zainu-d-d\u012bn Khw\u0101f\u012b. He had acquired practical sciences (\u02bful\u016bm-i-muta\u02bf\u0101rif\u0101) and had distinguished abilities. He was skilled in prose and the art of letter-writing. He was distinguished by his long association with his Majesty. He was also noted in the time of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b.\n\n(3). Shaikh Ab\u016b-l-wajd F\u0101r\u012bgh\u012b, paternal uncle of Shaikh Zain. He was a pleasant companion and of good disposition. He wrote poetry.\n\n(4). Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad K\u016bsa (beardless.) A pleasant man and a critic of poetry.

Gulbadan says the taking of Kabul was clearly a good omen, for B\u0101bar, then 23 and without a son, had many children born thereafter and she gives it as a reason for his liking Kabul that it was their birthplace. His attachment to it is also proved by his choosing it as his place of burial.\n\n1 T. R. E. & R. 478 and A. N. I. 128. The learning (\u02bfilm) meant is probably religious learning.

It\nmeant the index or fiduciary of an\nastrolabe. In Murray's English Dic-\ntionary, we are told that the alidad\nis the revolving radius of a gradu-\nated circle and that in the astrolabe,\nit revolved at the back and was\ncalled by Chaucer, the Rule. The\nstatement, however, that it revolved\nat the back, seems not quite correct.\nIn the astrolabes that I have seen,\nthe index\u2014it has two limbs\u2014is on\nthe face of the instrument. Per-\nhaps the explanation is that the\nastrolabe had two limbs or indices\nattached to it, one called the Rule\nand attached to the back of the\ninstrument and another in front and\ncalled the Label. (See Prof. Skeat's\nChaucer, III and the plates there\ngiven.) According to Moxon's Dict.\nit is the Label which is the alidad.\nWhitney (Century Dict.) quotes in\npart an interesting passage from the\nEncy. Brit. (X. 181, col. 2). The whole\nof it is as follows: \"The astrolabe\n(used by Vasco de Gama) was a metal\ncircle graduated round the edge\nwith a limb called the alhidada, fixed\nto a pin in the centre and working\nround the graduated circle.

The open plain of language narrows in the quest of his praises, and the paradeground of indication remains league upon league distant from the city of his virtues. God be praised that the time is nigh when I may withdraw my hand from lofty genealogy and plunge it in the skirt of my real intent. I now essay an abridged account of the astonishing actions of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiyy\u0101n\u012b for this is at once a preliminary nigh to my far-seen goal and a commentary forming part of the history of my saint and sovereign (P\u012br \u016b P\u0101dsh\u0101h). By unveiling the reflected godhead \\(^3\\) of the divine lord, I shall satisfy the thirsty-lipped \\(^4\\) with the sweet waters of knowledge and bring my own parched heart near the shore of the sea of the com-\n\nsuspended by a ring so as to hang vertically on one hand, while the alhidada was worked up and down until the Sun could be seen through both sights. It then gave the Zenith distance.\" (See Littr\u00e9, s.v. Alidada, Lane, s.v. and Dict. of T. Ts., I. 291 and II. 952.) According to the last named book, the alidad was at the back of the instrument as stated in Murray's Dict. A.F. applies the term to Humay\u016bn on account of his attainments, real or alleged, in mathematics.\n\n\\(^1\\) Orientals seem to have regarded Plato as a great ascetic.

And I have heard from some reliable persons that just as the honoured mother of his Majesty, the king of kings, was descended from his Holiness Shaikh (Ahmad) J\u0101m, so also was M\u0101ham B\u0113gam connected with him.

Maul\u0101n\u0101 Masn\u0101d\u012b found the date of his Majesty\u2019s birth to be Sult\u0101n Hum\u0101y\u016bn Kh\u0101n; and Sh\u0101h-i-fir\u016bz-qadr (Victorious Prince) and P\u0101dsh\u0101h-i-\u1e63af-shikan (Rank-breaking king) and also the saying \u201cKhush b\u0101d\u201d (May he be happy) give the date of this fortunate epoch, as discovered by the learned of the Age. Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n S\u0101m\u0101n\u012b has said:\n\nVerse.\n\nIt is the year of his fortunate birth,\nMay God increase his glory.\nI\u2019ve taken one alif from his date,\nThat I may blind two evil eyes.\n\n1 Here A.F. addresses his readers.\n2 M\u0101ham is evidently not her full name. Erskine asks if M\u0101ham be not a term of endearment used by B\u0101bar and signifying \u201cMy Moon.\u201d\n3 The first, second and fourth chronograms yield 913, the true date, but the third, 853 only. If we read p\u0101dsh\u0101h-i-\u1e63af-shikan-in (in = he) the chronogram will be correct.\n4 Apparently meaning that he was of the race of the S\u0101m\u0101nid\u00e6, ancient princes of Transoxiana. His chronogram is enigmatic. The\nThe accession of his Majesty took place in Agra on 9th Jum\u0101da\u2019l-awwal, 937 (29th December, 1530), and Khairu-l-mul\u016bk (Best of kings) is the chronogram. A few days later, he made an excursion upon the river and placing the barks of pleasure in the stream of joy, gave away on that day, a boat full of gold, and by the largesse laid a golden foundation of dominion. Bravo! the first grace bestowed on him upon whom is conferred the sovereignty of the world, is munificence and liberality.\n\nVerse.\n\nNot every man is exalted.\nHe becomes head who is kind to men.\nThe lion became king of all beasts\nBecause he was hospitable in the chase.\n\nAnd one of the learned found the date of this wave of giving in the words k\u012bsh\u012b-i-zar (boat or tray of gold = 937).\n\nFrom the commencement of his career till his accession when he had arrived at the age of 24, the notes of success and fortune were conspicuous on his destiny's forehead and the lights of glory and empire streamed forth from the tablets of his greatness and glory. How should not his lustrous temples radiate greatness and magnanimity when he was carrying the light of the king of kings and was the custodian of the granary of Divine knowledge? It was the same light which was shewn forth in the victories of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b and that gloriously appeared in the dawning.\n\nwords of the second line, Z\u0101daka-l\u0101h\u016b ta\u2019\u0101l\u0101 qadran yield 914 which is one too much. So the composer says, he takes away an alif which represents the figure one and also, from its shape, resembles a bodkin or the fine pencil (m\u012bl) used for blinding. Or it may perhaps be better to take burda am to mean \u201cI have added,\u201d e.g., that he has added the alif at the end of qadran but in that case, the preposition as constitutes a difficulty. I should state that the word All\u0101h in the chronogram is reckoned as 68, being considered to contain three Is, only two of which however are counted.\n\n1 Bad\u0101oni (I. 344) gives the couplet ending in the chronogram. See Dr. Ranking\u2019s trs. 451.\n\n2 K\u012bsh\u012b means both a boat and a tray but here A.F. seems to mean the former.

And it was this same light which from the time of the ocean pearl-shell Alanq\u016b\u0101, displayed itself from the royal shells and pearls under the veils of women in travail. It was the same light by whose splendour Ughaz Kh\u0101n was made glorious, and it was the same light which was preparing and increasing from Adam till Noah. The secrets of the revelation of this light, and the strange notes of its manifestation are beyond the circle of restraint and limitation, nor is everyone capable of recognizing this secret substance or of understanding its subtleties. To sum up; His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was illuminating the world with the power of this Divine light, which through so many cycles and epochs had been concealed under various garbs, and the time of its apparition was now at hand. Accordingly the glory of spiritual and temporal greatness was radiating from the arch of his Majesty\u2019s shining forehead. Perfect modesty and exceeding courage were conjoined in his holy nature, and all his lofty energy was devoted to fulfilling the desires of his great father; and the excellence of intrepidity being united with consummate majesty and dignity, out of his magnanimity and high-thoughtedness, he paid no regard to self and held himself of no account. Consequently he was glorious for right-mindedness and lofty courage in every enterprise that he engaged in and every service that he undertook. In the whole of his auspicious life, he adorned the world by joining knowledge with power, and power with compassion and clemency. In many sciences and especially in mathematics, he had no rival or colleague. His noble nature was marked by the combination of the energy of Alexander and the learning of Aristotle. He displayed great justice in carrying out the provisions of the will for the distribution of territories and exhibited thorough equity or rather exceeding kindness and beneficence therein. But superiority in spiritual perfections (which is real sovereignty), that was his own by God\u2019s grace; none of his brothers shared in the dainties of that table of inheritance.\n\nEveryone connected with the Court received offices and pensions. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n obtained K\u0101bul and Qandah\u0101r as his fief: M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b, Sambal; M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, Sark\u0101r Alwar. Badakhsh\u0101n was made over and confirmed to M\u012brz\u0101 Sulaim\u0101n; and the nobles and great officers and the whole of the victorious army were brought into obedience by proper measures. Everyone who breathed disaffection,\ne.g., Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, son of Badi\u02bfu-z-zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, son of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain M\u012brz\u0101 (who had been in the service of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101ni Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b and been distinguished by being made his son-in-law, but who had from short-sightedness and deficiency of judgment opened the sleeve of contumacy), bound the cincture of service on the waist of obedience. His Majesty, after five or six months, turned his attention to the conquest of K\u0101linjar and besieged that fort for about a month. When the people within became distressed, the governor submitted and sent twelve mans of gold with other presents. His Majesty had regard to his supplications and entreaties and forgave him. From thence he proceeded towards Cun\u0101r and besieged it.\n\nLet it not be concealed that this sky-based fortress was in the possession of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and was held for him by Jam\u0101l Kh\u0101n Kh\u0101ss\u0101 Khail S\u0101rangkh\u0101n\u012b. After the catastrophe of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, Jam\u0101l Kh\u0101n\u2019s life came to an end from the evil design of a worthless son, and Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n sought the widow (who was called L\u0101d Mulk, and was adorned with beauty and charm) for his wife and by this contrivance got possession of the fortress. When Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n heard of the approach of the conquering army, he left his son, Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n with a number of trusty persons, in the fort, and came out himself. He sent clever ambassadors and wove crafty speeches. His Majesty, recognizing the circumstances of the time, accepted his proposals and Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n sent his son, \u2018Abdu-r-rash\u012bd to serve his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b so that he might himself remain guarded from the blows of the imperial armies and might arrange the materials of pride and presumption. This son was for a long time in the service, but when his Majesty came to M\u0101lwa, to subdue Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, that worth-\n\n---\n\n1 He married B\u0101bar\u2019s daughter Ma\u02be\u1e63\u016bma whose mother (also called Ma\u02be\u1e63\u016bma) died in childbed.

In 939, when Biban and B\u0101yazid the Afgh\u0101ns rose in rebellion, his Majesty proceeded to the eastward. B\u0101yazid was killed in battle against the warlike heroes and this rubbish was cleared away, and Jaunp\u016br and the neighbouring territories, having been given to Sult\u0101n Junaid Barl\u0101s, his Majesty returned to the capital.\n\nAs the echo of his Majesty\u2019s victories and conquests was high-sounding in various kingdoms, Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, the ruler of Gujr\u0101t, sent, in 940, experienced ambassadors bearing valuable presents to him and set in motion the processes of friendship. His Majesty received his overtures with imperial kindness and set his heart at rest by sending him diplomas of amity. In the same year, a city was founded on the banks of the Jumna, near Delhi, which received the name of Dinpan\u0101h. One of the learned of the Age found the chronogram Shahr-i-p\u0101dsh\u0101h-i-dinpan\u0101h (City of the King, Defender of the Faith=940). After that, Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 and Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 with his son, Ulugh M\u012brz\u0101, took the path of hostility and rebellion. His Majesty turned the reins of resolution against them and encamped on the Ganges near Bh\u016bjp\u016br. Y\u0101dg\u0101r Na\u1e63\u012br M\u012brz\u0101 was sent across the river with a large force against the rebels, and by Divine help, he gained a victory. Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101, Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 and Wali Kh\u016bb M\u012brz\u0101 were made prisoners. Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n was sent to Bi\u0101na and the other two were blinded and thereby cast down from the pillar of respect. Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 did not recognize the kindness with which he had been treated, but got out of prison by presenting a forged order. He then fled to Gujr\u0101t to Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur.\n\nMany of the delightful countries of India which had not been conquered in the time of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101ni Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101ni on account of want of leisure and shortness of time were subdued by his (Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s) arm of dominion and strength of fortune.\n\n---\n\n1 See Khw\u0101nd M\u012br\u2019s account of the founding of this city.

But whene'er felicity's diadem hath exalted the head of a fortunate one and the Divine protection is watching over him, what save evil (tab\u0101h\u012b) can happen to the evil-disposed (tab\u0101h)? It is stated that at that time Mir Y\u016bnus 'Al\u012b was, in accordance with the orders of G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b, Governor of L\u0101h\u014dr. Having laid his plans, Mirz\u0101 Kamr\u0101n one night pretended to be enraged with Qar\u0101ca B\u0113g and used violent language towards him. Next night Qar\u0101ca B\u0113g fled with his soldiers from the Mirz\u0101's camp to L\u0101h\u014dr. Mir Y\u016bnus 'Al\u012b regarded his coming as of much importance and received him with great kindness and frequently invited him to his own quarters. They were on friendly terms but Qar\u0101ca was watching his opportunity, till at length on one night when there was a convivial party, and Y\u016bnus 'Al\u012b's best soldiers were away at their quarters, he seized him and, putting him in prison, placed his own men in charge of the Fort gates. He then hurried off a message to Mirz\u0101 Kamr\u0101n. The Mirz\u0101 (who was in expectation of this), came post to L\u0101h\u014dr and took possession of the city. He released Mir Y\u016bnus 'Al\u012b, apologized to him and said that if he would remain, he\n\n1 This chapter is a parenthesis and should apparently have been inserted by A.

Mir Y\u016bnus \u2018Al\u012b did not consent to serve him and taking leave, went off to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b. Mirz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n appointed his own creatures to the pargan\u0101s of the Sirk\u0101r\u00b9 of the Panj\u0101b and took possession up to the Satlaj (which is known as the Water of L\u016bdhiy\u0101na). Then he craftily sent skilful ambassadors with protestations of loyalty and sincerity and begged that he might be confirmed in the province. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, partly because the sea of his liberality had been set in motion, and partly from a desire to observe the precepts of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b, made over the province to him and issued a decree appointing him to the charge of K\u0101bul, Qandah\u0101r and the Panj\u0101b. The Mirz\u0101 returned thanks for this unexpected favour and sent presents to the Court. He followed this up by opening the gates of correspondence and by sending eulogiums of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. Among them was the following ode:\n\nOde.\n\nMay thy beauty increase each moment;\nMay thy star be splendid and fortunate;\nMay every mist which rises on thy way,\nBe the dimming of the light of my own eyes.\nShould dust arise\u00b2 on Laila\u2019s path,\nMay its place\u00b3 be Majn\u016bn\u2019s eyes.\nWoe\u2019er moves not round thee like the limb of a compass,\nMay he be ejected from this sphere.\nBe victorious\u2074 while this world endures,\nMay Hum\u0101y\u016bn be the Cyrus (Khusr\u016b) of epochs.\n\nAnd in truth his prayer was heard, for by reason of his disloyalty, he was ejected from the sphere of respect or rather from the sphere of existence, as will be stated in its own place. In short,\n\n\u00b9 More generally, \u0160\u016bba L\u0101h\u014dr.\n\u00b2 Price (IV. 717) seems to have read the words gird k\u0101n, i.e., should dust, as gar dukan, if moss (or touchwood); for he translates, \u201cDoes the moss and the thistle overgrow the path of Laila.\u201d\n\u00b3 No. 4944 seems to have j\u0101ft, injurious.\n\u2074 K\u0101mr\u0101n. There is a play on the author\u2019s name and the words may also be rendered, \u201cO K\u0101mr\u0101n.\u201d\nhis Majesty out of his magnanimity, looked to his outward loyalty and made him the recipient of princely favours and from exceeding kindness, rewarded him for the ode by bestowing upon him His\u0101r Fir\u016bza (Hissar). The M\u012brz\u0101 always kept up appearances and continued in obedience and became the receptacle of many favours. In 939,\u00b9 (1532\u201333), M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n made over the government of Qandah\u0101r to Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n B\u0113g. The cause of this was that when M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Askar\u012b was coming to K\u0101bul he encountered the Haz\u0101ras on the way and was defeated by them. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n was displeased by this and took away Qandah\u0101r from him.\n\n\u00b9 The Text and several MSS. have 933 which must be wrong. No. 4944 B. M. has 939, which is no doubt correct and which Price must have found in his MS. (Vide IV. 718).\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nMARCH OF THE ARMY OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100NI JANNA\u1e6c-\u0100SH\u012aY\u0100N\u012a FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF BENGAL, ABANDONMENT OF THE DESIGN, AND RETURN TO THE CAPITAL.\n\nWhen the mind of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni was at leisure from the affairs of his dominions, he, in 941 (1534), turned the rein of intent towards the eastern quarter and the conquest of Bengal. The standards of felicity had reached the town of K\u0101n\u0101r,\u00b9 within the limits of K\u0101lp\u012b, when it came to the royal hearing that Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, under the pretext of besieging Cit\u014dr, had gathered a large body of men under T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, son of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn, and that he was entertaining wild projects. His Majesty after an enlightened consultation, despatched, in Jum\u0101da\u2019l-awwal 941 (November-December, 1534,) a force to quell the enemy, and himself beat high the drum of return.\n\nIt is not unknown to the circumspect that Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur was ever engaged in high-flying imaginings, and was always holding in his palate the bruised thorn\u00b2 of evil wishes. But as, before he became the ruler of Gujr\u0101t and was but a private individual, he had seen with the eye of warning a specimen of his Majesty G\u012bti-sitt\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bsmak\u0101n\u012b\u2019s way of fighting in the campaign against Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm; he could not bring himself for any consideration to resolve on encountering the victorious soldiers of that illustrious family. And this view he repeatedly expressed to his confidants. When T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n\n\n\u00b9 Kin\u0101r of Erskine, II. 16.

For a time Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur was not caught, but at length he one day laid bare the truth, and said to T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n: \"I have been a witness\\(^1\\) of the superiority of those splendid soldiers; the Gujrat army is no match for them, so I shall by craft and contrivance win over his (Humayun's) army to myself.\" Accordingly he opened the doors of his treasuries and lavished gold and thereby gained over as many as 10,000 men, who had the skill\\(^2\\) to appear as soldiers without being in reality such. During this time Muhammad Zam\u0101n Mirz\u0101 escaped from confinement by the connivance of his custodians,\\(^3\\) the servants of Y\u0101dg\u0101r B\u0113g Tagh\u0101i,\\(^4\\) and came to Gujrat. The lord of that country, on account of the crude plans that he was concocting, regarded the arrival of the Mirz\u0101 as a gain and treated him with great consideration. His Majesty Jah\u0101ub\u0101ni wrote to Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur that treaties and engagements required that all who had turned obligations (buq\u016bq) of service into disobligations ('uq\u016bq) and had fled to his (Bah\u0101dur's) dominions, should be sent back or at least be driven out from his presence, so that their unanimity (his own and Bah\u0101dur's) might be evidenced to the world. Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, either from inexperience or the intoxication of the world, wrote in reply \"Should a high-born man take refuge with us and be treated with consideration, there could not be in this any breach of good feeling or of sincerity, nor any detriment to treaties. For instance, in the days of Sikandar Lodi, there was perfect friendship betwixt him and Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e93affar (Bah\u0101dur's father), yet his brother Sult\u0101n 'Al\u0101'u-d-d\u012bn and many Sult\u0101ns' sons came upon occasions from Agra and Dehli to Gujrat and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) B\u0101bar's Memos, Ers. 343. Bah\u0101dur had quarrelled with his father and taken refuge with Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and was with him at about the time of the battle of Panipat, though apparently he left before the battle. B\u0101bar calls him a bloodthirsty and ungovernable young man.\n\n\\(^2\\) This, I presume, is the meaning of the phrase ki hukm-i-num\u016bd-i-bi-\n\n\\(^3\\) Erskine, II. 42, speaks of his escaping along with his keeper Y\u0101dg\u0101r Tagh\u0101i.

Never did this cause a breach of friendship!\" His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b sent a suitable missive in reply, to this purport, \"The note of steadfastness in the path of observance of treaties is simply this, that any act which can shake the pillars of loyalty be utterly eschewed so that the cheek of concord be not scratched by the nail of enmity.\" He also enclosed these two couplets in the rescript.\n\nVerse I.\n\nO Thou who vauntest a loving heart\nHurrah a million times, if heart and tongue accord.\n\nVerse II.\u00b9\n\nPlant the tree of friendship that the heart's desire may bear fruit,\nUproot the sapling of enmity that yields countless ills.\n\n\"Beware, a hundred thousand times beware; listen to my advice with the ear of understanding and send that abandoned one (makhz\u016bl) to the foot of the throne, or withdraw the hand of favour from him and let him not abide in thy dominions. Else how can reliance be put on thy friendship? Strange it is that you liken this matter to those of 'Al\u0101'u-d-d\u012bn and others like him. What analogy is there between the cases? That affair was one thing, and this is another. Mayhap you have learnt from books of history that in spite of the refractoriness of Ildar\u012bm Bay\u0101z\u012bd, his Majesty S\u0101\u1e25ib Qar\u0101n\u012b (Tim\u016br) was constitutionally indisposed to invade R\u016bm, inasmuch as Bay\u0101z\u012bd was engaged in a war with the Franks. But as Qar\u0101 Y\u016bsuf Turkman and Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ahmad Jal\u0101\u012br had fled to him, his Majesty by sundry good counsels forbade him to entertain them. When Bay\u0101z\u012bd refused to accede to this, his Majesty showed what his might was.\"\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 According to Fir\u016bghta (see his account of B\u0101bar's reign) this couplet was sent by Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101'\u012bl to Shaib\u0101n\u012b to warn him against attacking Persia.\n\n\u00b2 Two of the letters which passed between Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Bah\u0101dur are given at greater length in the Mir\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b, B.M. Add. 26,277, 1330. See also Bayley's Gujr\u0101t; the letters are also given, as Sir E. C. Bayley has pointed out in the collection of letters B.M. Add. 7688; Rieu I. 390b. Tim\u016br's letter to Bay\u0101z\u012bd is given in the Zafarn\u0101ma, II. 256, and the reasons why he made war on him are stated at 389 l. c., Bib. Ind. ed. But, as Bayley has pointed out, Tim\u016br only\nSult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur out of a weak head and foolishness did not write a sensible reply. Meanwhile T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n kept saying vain things\u00b9 to Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, calculated to deceive narrow intellects, and kept urging that he himself might be sent towards the imperial dominions, representing that the royal army had grown pampered and comfort-loving, and was no longer such as the Sult\u0101n had seen. In consequence of the misrepresentations of strife-mongers, Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur made preparations for despatching T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n and sent to the fort of Ranthanbh\u016br twenty krores of the old coinage of Gujrat\u00b2\u2014equal to forty krores of the current Dehli coinage\u2014to be used under T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n\u2019s instructions for the hiring of new soldiers. He also sent Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn, father of T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, with a large force towards Kalinjar, to stir up a disturbance in that quarter. Likewise he deputed Burh\u0101nu-l-mulk Bany\u0101ni\u00b3 and a body of Gujratis to proceed to N\u0101g\u014dr and make an attempt on the Panjab, dividing his forces with the idea that the imperial army would thereby be thrown into confusion. Though able and experienced men told him that his forces\n\n\u00b9 Tungshar\u0101b\u012b, lit. easily becoming drunk.\n\n\u00b2 Zor, gold; but apparently silver coinage is meant. Erskine in his MS. translation of the Akbarn\u0101ma (in the British Museum,) seems to regard the money as silver, but in his History, II. 44, speaks of it as gold, and says A.F. estimates the Gujrat gold coins as double that of his own time. But surely A. F. would never admit that the Gujrat gold coins were as fine as or finer than Akbar\u2019s! See Ain Blochmann, 18 and 31. In Firighta\u2019s account of Bah\u0101dur Sh\u0101h, (History of Gujrat,) the amount is spoken of as thirty krores of mugaf-faris, though Briggs seems to have had three and not thirty in his MS. Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, from whom Firighta probably borrowed his figures, has thirty in his account of Gujrat.\n\n\u00b3 Mull\u0101ni Text, but it is clear from the Mir\u0101t-i-Sikandari that Bany\u0101ni, given in the Bib. Ind. as a variant, is the true reading.\nshould march in one direction, they were not successful, and though both by hints and plain speech they delineated on the board of manifestation the insuspiciousness of treaty breaking, it was of no avail. He gave way to the vain thought that as the L\u016bdiy\u0101n party claimed the sovereignty of Hind\u016bst\u0101n, the supporting of them (tal\u0101gh-i-\u012bsh\u0101n) did not interfere with his promises, and that the consequences of a violation of engagements would not recoil upon himself. He sent T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n on a bootless quest towards Dihl\u012b and, keeping both aloof from and in touch with him, addressed himself to the siege of C\u012bt\u014dr so that he might both capture the fortress and be an intermediary for helping the L\u016bdiy\u0101ns when occasion offered. Be it known that Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn bore the name of \u2018\u0100lam Kh\u0101n. He was brother of Sikandar L\u014dd\u012b and paternal uncle of Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. After Sult\u0101n Sikandar\u2019s death he contended with Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and in the territory of Sihrind set up a claim to the sovereignty and giving himself the title of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn, marched towards Agra with a force of double-faced Afgh\u0101ns. Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm came out to fight, and the two factions met near H\u014ddal. Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn not finding himself strong enough to engage in a pitched battle made a night attack, but was unsuccessful and had to return with loss. Fraudulently and with evil intent he went to K\u0101bul, and in the war with Ibr\u0101h\u012bm he was with the victorious army. After the conquest of India his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101ni Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b became cognisant of his hidden motives and sent him to Badakhsh\u0101n.\n\n1 This must be the second siege of C\u012bt\u014dr by Bah\u0101dur. On the first occasion the R\u0101n\u0101 bought off the attack. It is to Bah\u0101dur\u2019s wars with the Hind\u016bs and Portuguese that Hum\u0101y\u016bn refers when speaking of T\u012bm\u016br\u2019s abstention from invasion whilst Bay\u0101z\u012bd was making war on Constantinople.\n\n2 In Sark\u0101r Sah\u0101r, \u0160\u016bbah of Agra, Jarrett II, 96 and 195. In the Persian text of the \u0100in I, 357 and 455, it is spelt H\u014dral \u0644\u0648\u0631\u0644, and Tiefenthaler I, 169 and 207, spells it Horel and says it has many brick houses, and lies on the road from Mathur\u0101 to Dihl\u012b. It is about 80 miles south of Dihl\u012b. Hunter, I. G., has Hod\u0101l and describes it as in the Gurg\u0101on district, Panj\u0101b.\n\n3 This is a mistake. \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn went to K\u0101bul before his defeat and after it he met B\u0101bar in India near Pelh\u016br. B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem., 297.\n\n4 Qila Zafar seems to have been used by B\u0101bar as a state-prison. He sent Sh\u0101h B\u0113g, the son of Zu-n-n\u016bn, there before the final capture of Qandah\u0101r, but Sh\u0101h B\u0113g managed to escape by the help of a slave, Sumbul.\nthe help of Afgh\u0101n traders he escaped from Q\u012bl\u2019a Zafar and came to Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n, and from thence to Bal\u016bcist\u0101n, and finally reached Gujr\u0101t.\n\nIn short, when the armies set out T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n laid hold of the treasure and set about recruiting soldiers. Nearly 40,000 cavalry, Afgh\u0101ns and others, gathered round him, and he came to Bi\u0101na and took it. When this news was brought to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni, who had marched to subdue the eastern countries, he turned the reins of attention, and with the greatest rapidity arrived at Agra, the capital. He despatched M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b, M\u012brz\u0101 Hind\u0101l, Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101,1 Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sult\u0101n, M\u012br Faq\u012br \u2018Al\u012b,2 Z\u0101hid B\u0113g and D\u014dst B\u0113g with 18,000 horse to put down this disturbance. His Majesty remarked that the putting down of this large army, which was approaching Dihli with evil designs, would be in reality the extirpating of the other armies; it was therefore best to address one\u2019s efforts to the subduing of it. When the victorious army drew near the opposing force, fear fell on the latter and there were daily desertions, so that it gradually decreased and in brief space dwindled down to 3,000 horse. As T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n had obtained his army by\n\nMihtar. The story is told in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-sind. B\u0101bar does not mention it, but with an evident reference to Sumbul\u2019s subsequent achievement he speaks with regret (p. 230), of Sumbul effecting his escape after Qandah\u0101r was taken.\n\nAs pointed out by Erskine II, 58, and 44m., there were two \u2018\u0100lam Kh\u0101ns, (Bayley 276n., says there were three), and there is considerable confusion between them. The one who called himself \u2018Al\u012b\u2019u-d-d\u012bn, and was the brother of Sikandar, had a command at the battle of Kh\u0101nw\u0101 in 1527 (B\u0101bar 363), and his son or sons were there also, l. c. 364. He was put to death in Gujr\u0101t in 950 (1543). Bird, 260, 261. See Dorn\u2019s Hist. of the Afgh\u0101ns and B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs, 295, for accounts of his defeat by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (his nephew). Erskine, Hist. I, 422n. remarks on the great age of \u2018Al\u012b\u2019u-d-d\u012bn as shown by the statement in Firights. He is apparently the man whom the Portuguese saw at Diu in 1535. See Rehatsek, Calcutta Review, 1882, No. 147, p. 73, where it is said that one of those present was a brother of the Emperor of Dihli and apparently seventy years old. He is also probably the \u2018\u0100lam Kh\u0101n of the same article, pp. 960 and 99. The other \u2018\u0100lam Kh\u0101n appears to have been a nephew of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and consequently a grand-nephew of the \u2018\u0100lam Kh\u0101n who was \u2018Al\u012b\u2019u-d-d\u012bn.\n\n1 Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s cousin.\n2 Later on, the name is spelt Faqr. Possibly it should be Fakhr, and it is so spelt in Bad\u0101oni I, 352.\ngreat importunity and had spent vast sums of money on it, he neither could make up his mind (r\u0101\u012b) to retire, nor could he make head (r\u016b\u012b) in war. At last he washed his hands of life, and came to an engagement at Mandr\u0101\u012b. After having for a while struggled hand and foot, he became handless and footless and was made the target of fatal arrows, and the harvest of blood-shedding heroes. On the dispersal of this army what the inspired mind had foreseen came to pass, for the two other forces broke up of themselves on the report of the victory and felicity of the conquering army.\n\n1 Apparently this is the Man\u1e0dl\u0101\u012br of the \u0100\u012bn, Jarrett II, 190, and the Mandalayan or Madraef of Tiefenthaler I, 174. It is in Sark\u0101r Man\u1e0dl\u0101\u012br, and is, according to Tiefenthaler, two miles west of the Cambal. He describes it as 12 miles S.S.E. of Karauli in which R\u0101jput\u0101n\u0101 State it seems to be situated. It lies south of Agra and apparently not far from Bi\u0101na. According to Nig\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn and Firighta, T\u0101t\u0101r Khan's force was reduced to 2,000 men, and he perished with 300 of his officers after a very gallant fight. The author of the Mir\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b gives an account of his struggle.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nACCOUNT OF THE EXPEDITION OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100NI JANNAT-\u0100SH\u012aY\u0100N\u012a FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF GUJR\u0100T, OF THE DEFEAT OF SULT\u0100N BAH\u0100DUR, AND THE CONQUEST OF THAT COUNTRY.\n\nThough the world-conquering heart (of Hum\u0101y\u016bn) was void of the thought of the conquest of Gujr\u0101t so long as its ruler trod the path of harmony and sincerity, yet when the Creator wills to adorn a country with the splendour (far) of a lawgiver's advent, He inevitably prepareth the means therefor. The actions of the ruler of Gujr\u0101t are a proof of this, for he, out of native arrogance, the assaults of flatterers, abundance of intoxication and intoxicated men, poverty of prudence and of the prudent, broke without object, treaties and visible ties, and became author of many improper acts. Thus it grew imperative for the lofty spirit (of Hum\u0101y\u016bn) to march his army towards Gujr\u0101t. Accordingly in the beginning of Jum\u0101da-l-awwal, 941, (8th November, 1534), the foot of determination was placed, in a happy hour, in the stirrup of felicity, and the reins of prowess were directed to the subjugation of Gujr\u0101t. When the army approached the fortress of R\u0101j\u0101n,\u00b9 the garrison submitted entreaties together with rich presents, representing that the fort was his Majesty's, and themselves his Majesty's slaves, and that as soon as the affair of Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur was settled, of what use would the fort be? In fact, as the object in view was the conquest of Gujr\u0101t, the army did not delay here, but marched on towards M\u0101lw\u0101. When the army had encamped at S\u0101rangp\u016br\u00b2 the news of its arrival reached Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur who was then besieging Cit\u014dr. He awoke from the sleep of carelessness and sought the advice of his followers.\n\n\u00b9 Fort in Bh\u014dp\u0101l, I. G. and Jarrett II, 199. It was taken by Sh\u0113r Sh\u0101h in 1545.\n\u00b2 On the K\u0101l\u012b Sind, Dew\u0101s State of the Central Indian Agency, 80 miles from Indore, I. G., Jarrett II, 203, and Tiefenthaler I, 351, who describes it as ruined.\nMost were of opinion that as the matter of Cit\u00f6r could be settled at any time and the garrison was not giving any annoyance at present, the proper course was to put off the reduction of the fort and to march against the royal army. But \u015eadr Kh\u00e2n, who was prominent for knowledge and eloquence, and who ranked high in the congress (jirga) of soldiers and was renowned for wisdom and counsel, said that the proper thing was to finish the matter of the fortress, already nearly accomplished, and that as they had come out against infidels, the King of Isl\u00e2m would not come against them. Should he do so, they would then be excused if they abandoned a holy war (ghaz\u00e2) and attacked him. This view commended itself to Sult\u00e2n Bah\u00e2dur, so he went on with the siege, and on 3rd Ram\u00e2z\u00e2n, 941, (8th March, 1535), subdued the fort of Cit\u00f6r. Thereupon he marched against the illustrious army which was then encamped at Ujjain.\u00b9 When the news of Sult\u00e2n Bah\u00e2dur\u2019s audacity reached the royal hearing, his Majesty also accelerated his movements, and the two armies encamped in the territory of Mandas\u00fbr,\u00b2 belonging to M\u00e2lw\u00e2, on the opposite banks of a lake which for greatness and breadth was a sea. An engagement took place between the van of his Majesty Jah\u00e2nb\u00e2ni\u2019s army commanded by Bacaka Bah\u00e2dur, and Sult\u00e2n Bah\u00e2dur\u2019s van under Sayyid \u2018Al\u00ee Kh\u00e2n and Mirz\u00e2 Muq\u00eem, who had the title of Khur\u00e2s\u00e2n Kh\u00e2n, in which the latter was worsted. Sult\u00e2n Bah\u00e2dur too was worsted (shikasta) in his heart. T\u00e2j Kh\u00e2n and \u015eadr Kh\u00e2n said to him \u201cOur army is flushed with the victory of Cit\u00f6r and has not yet greatly felt the force of the royal army; it will address itself to battle with a stout heart. We\n\n\u00b9 In text without tashdid, but see Ain Bib. Ind. I, 457.\n\u00b2 Now in Gw\u00e2l\u00eer. In Jarrett II, 208, spelt Man\u00f4s\u00fbr. It is about 80 miles north-west of Ujjain and on the north bank of the Se\u00ee, a tributary of the Cambal. There is a plan of the British encampment near Mandas\u00fbr in Blacker\u2019s Mahratta War, London 1821, but no lake or tank is shown there. Possibly the lake has dried up since A.F.\u2019s time as had happened with the K\u00e2nkaria reservoir near Ahmad\u00e2b\u00e2d, Tiefenthaler I, 378; or perhaps A.F. means Lake Deb\u00e2r which is not very far off and lies between Cit\u00f6r and Ujjain. See the R\u00e2jp\u00fbt\u00e2n\u00e2 Gazetteer III, 12. It is true this lake is said to have been only made in the end of the 17th century, but it may have existed before this. Neither Fir\u00e2ghta, N\u00eeg\u00e2mu-d-d\u00een nor the Mir\u2019\u00e2t-i-Sikandar\u00ee refers to any lake.\nof the victorious army came to the camp of Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur and set about plundering it. A quantity of spoil, including many elephants, and horses fell into their hands. Khud\u0101wand Kh\u0101n who had been both preceptor (ust\u0101d) and finance-minister (waz\u012br) of Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e93affar was made prisoner and was treated by his Majesty with great favour and made one of his servants. Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101, Q\u0101sim Sult\u0101n, and M\u012br Hind\u016b B\u0113g were despatched with a large force to pursue the routed army.\n\nVerily, whoever consorts with men of darkened understanding, become darkened. Especially shall an evil day come upon the man who violates treaties and engagements, and comes forward as a juggler, and plays the game of deception against such a world-lord who is the cynosure of sincerity and rectitude. In fine, after \u1e62adr Kh\u0101n and \u2018Im\u0101du-l-mulk had departed, his Majesty\u2019s army went straight to the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b. His Majesty followed in the wake of his troops, and halted at Na\u02bflca, and drew his camp round the fort. R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n deserted the hostile army and entered his Majesty\u2019s service and received a robe of honour. On the 14th day Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur after passing by circuitous routes entered the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b by the C\u016bli Mahesar Gate. A talk of an agreement took place, according to which Gujr\u0101t and the recently acquired Cit\u014dr should remain with the Sult\u0101n, while M\u0101nd\u016b and its territory should belong to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b.

It is mentioned, (Jarrett II, 112 and 207) as a mahal in Sark\u0101r M\u0101nd\u016b and is described in Dr. Campbell\u2019s account of M\u0101nd\u016b, Journal Bomb. R. A. S. XIX, 154 for 1896. He spells it Na\u02bflcha and describes it as three miles north of the Dihli Gate of M\u0101nd\u016b.\n\n3 It will be seen from this that Khud\u0101wand Kh\u0101n, the waz\u012br, and R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n are different persons.\n\nAccording to the Mir\u02be\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b (Bayley\u2019s Gujr\u0101t, 386), R\u016bm\u012b deserted at Mandasor. The author tells an amusing story, on the authority of his father, about R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n\u2019s being abused by Bah\u0101dur\u2019s parrot.\n\n4 The month is not given, but it must be Z\u012b-l-q\u0101\u02bfda, so the date corresponds to 19th May, 1535. Possibly however what is meant is the 14th day after Hum\u0101y\u016bn invested the fort.\n\n5 Mentioned as a meh\u0101l of M\u0101nd\u016b, Jarrett II, 206.\n\n6 Text Pir \u2018Al\u012b.\nMajesty's side and Sadr Kh\u0101n on behalf of Sultan Bah\u0101dur sat down together in the N\u012bl\u012b Sabil to make arrangements. At the end of the night the sentinels of the fort left off pacing to and fro, and about 200 soldiers of the victorious army entered at the back, some by placing ladders and some by ropes. Then throwing themselves down from the wall, they opened the fort gate there and brought in their horses and mounted them. Other soldiers entered by the gate.\n\nThe news was brought to the officer in charge of the works, Mall\u016b Kh\u0101n of M\u0101nd\u016b, who had the title of Q\u0101dir Sh\u0101h. He got on horseback and galloped to the Sultan who was still asleep. He (Bah\u0101dur) was awakened by Q\u0101dir Sh\u0101h's cries and, between sleeping and waking, took to flight, and rushed out with three or four others. On the way Bh\u016bpat R\u0101i, son of Silh\u0101d\u012b, who was one of his companions, came up from behind and joined him with about twenty horsemen. When they got to the gate opening on the esplanade, about 200 horsemen of the victorious army came forward to intercept them. The Sultan was the first to attack them and he was seconded by some others. At last he and Mall\u016b Kh\u0101n and one other follower cut their way through and reached the fort of Sungad. Bah\u0101dur lowered down horses from there by ropes, and then letting himself down he after a thousand troubles took the road to Gujr\u0101t. Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Kh\u0101n was standing near the Fort. An Uzbak named B\u016br\u012b who had deserted from the Sultan's service and become the servant of Q\u0101sim\n\n---\n\n1 Blue road. Perhaps this is the Nilkanth celebrated by Jah\u0101ng\u012br and which was visited by Akbar. See Dr. Campbell's article already cited. I do not however find the name Nilkanth in the T\u016bzak. See p. 181 of Sayyid A\u1e25mad's ed.\n\n2 m\u016brcal, battery or earthwork. Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn in his history of Gujr\u0101t calls it the battery of 700 steps.\n\n3 According to the Mir'\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b, lithog. ed. 279 and Bayley, 388, Bh\u016bpat betrayed M\u0101nd\u016b to the enemy in revenge for his father who had been killed in 938 (1532), when fighting against Bah\u0101dur. Silh\u0101d\u012b or Sulh\u016b-d-d\u012bn, his father, was a Hind\u016b and prince of M\u0101lw\u0101. He fought against B\u0101bar at the battle of Kh\u0101nwa. Bah\u0101dur attacked him and deprived him of R\u0101jput, &c., because he kept Musalm\u0101n women in his harem. He was induced to turn Mu\u1e25ammadan and his name was altered to Sulh\u016b-d-d\u012bn. But he recanted and died a R\u0101jput's death, a circumstance which may remind us of Cranmer's end. See Bayley, 364.\n\n4 It is the inner part or citadel of M\u0101nd\u016b. See Dr. Campbell's article. In text it is written S\u016bnk\u0101r.\nHusain Kh\u0101n, recognised the Sult\u0101n and informed the Kh\u0101n. But the latter, owing to his length of service, treated what he heard as unheard and so Bah\u0101dur carried off half-a-life into safety, and was joined by 1,500 men by the time he had reached C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br. When he got there, he sent as much of his treasures and valuables as he could to the port of Diu.\n\nNow that the narrative has come so far, we cannot avoid giving some account of the beginning of this auspicious victory. As the victorious heroes were so rapid in getting into the fort of M\u0101nd\u016b and in performing prodigies of valour there, no authentic news of their success emerged in the early morning. When two hours of day had elapsed his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b heard of the entry, &c., and mounting his horse proceeded towards the fort and entered by the Dihl\u012b gate.\n\n\u1e62adr Kh\u0101n and his men were meanwhile fighting at the entrance to his house, and though he was wounded he continued firm. At last, the nobles seized his rein and conducted him to Sungad. Many people went with him and took refuge there, and among them was Sult\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam. The victorious soldiers plundered the houses of the enemy for three days, and then an order was issued for restraining the spoilers. Reliable persons were sent to \u1e62adr Kh\u0101n and Sult\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam, who inspired them with confidence. After long parleys of little moment, they gave the besieged quarter and brought them out, but as Sult\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam had several times committed sedition and rebellion, he was hamstringed and let go. To \u1e62adr Kh\u0101n royal favours were shown. Three days after this victory, his Majesty came down from the fort and proceeded by forced marches to Gujrat, accompanied\n\n---\n\n1 Vis., kuhna-'amalagi. This is a sneer at old servants whom A. F., being himself a new man, did not like. See a similar use of kuhna-'amala at 157 l. 9, and also see 139, l. 3.\n\n2 Text, D\u012bp d\u012bn but spelt D\u012b\u016b in Mir'\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b.\n\n3 The northern gate.\n\n4 Pai karda. See Mir'\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b, 258, for account of this man, and also Bayley, 366n. Apparently he was Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's nephew and consequently grand-nephew of the '\u0100lam Kh\u0101n who called himself Sult\u0101n '\u0100la'u-d-d\u012bn. He was the son of Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n, and at one time was governor of K\u0101lp\u012b. Perhaps Hum\u0101y\u016bn was incensed against him because he had proved ungrateful for Hum\u0101y\u016bn's kindness in introducing him to B\u0101bar. B\u0101bar's Mem. 349, 375. According to Bayley, 388, he was put to death at M\u0101nd\u016b.\nby 30,000 chosen horsemen, while the camp was ordered to follow stage by stage.\n\nWhen the victorious troops came near C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br they halted, and drew up by the side of the Pipli Gate near the tank of \u2018Im\u0101du-l-mulk which is three kus in circumference. When Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Bah\u0101dur heard of this, he strengthened the fort and went out by another gate, on the side of the Shukr tank, and fled to Cambay. By his instructions the town (C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br) was set on fire, but when his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b arrived, he directed the flames to be extinguished. Leaving M\u012br Hind\u016b B\u0113g and the rest in C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br he took about a thousand horse and set off rapidly in pursuit of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Bah\u0101dur. As soon as the Sultan came to Cambay he hastened to Diu, after setting fire to a hundred warships (Ghar\u0101b), which he had prepared against the Portuguese, lest the soldiers of the sublime army should embark on them and pursue him. On the same day that he left for Diu, his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b reached Cambay and encamped by the seaside. From thence he despatched a force in pursuit of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Bah\u0101dur. When the Sultan reached Diu, the victorious soldiers returned from its neighbourhood with abundance of booty. By the favours of heaven were M\u0101nd\u016b and Gujr\u0101t conquered in 942 (1535). Whoever is stayed upon God and whose standard is a good intention, will assuredly have his desire placed within his bosom.\n\nIn the beginning of Sh\u2018ab\u0101n of this year, (25th January, 1536), M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n marched from L\u0101h\u014dr to K\u0101bul, and after a great battle won a victory over S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101, the brother of Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp Safav\u012b. The short account of this is as follows. S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101 came to Qandah\u0101r with a large body of Qizilb\u0101sh\u012bs (Persians). Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n B\u0113g had strengthened Qandah\u0101r and defended it for eight months. Meanwhile M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n marched from L\u0101h\u014dr with a full equipment. A great battle took place between him and S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101. Aghziw\u0101r Kh\u0101n, one of the great officers of the Qizilb\u0101sh\u012bs and S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s tutor, was taken prisoner and put to death, and many of the Qizilb\u0101sh\u012bs perished. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n returned victorious to L\u0101h\u014dr,\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. the line in preface of Anw\u0101r-i-SuhailI: \u201cNo seeker leaves that door without obtaining his desire.\u201d\n2 Then about 20 years of age. He afterwards wrote biographies of Persian poets. Rieu\u2019s Cat. I, 367b.\n3 There is an account of this victory in the T\u0101r. Rash\u012bd Ross & Elias, 468. Haidar attributes the victory to Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n.\nand the disturbance caused by Mirz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n was put down. The explanation of this is briefly this. It has been already mentioned that after the defeat of Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, M. Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n marched against L\u0101h\u014dr with the idea of stirring up strife there. When he came to the borders of Sind, Sh\u0101h \u1e24usain, the son of Sh\u0101h B\u0113g Argh\u0101n and the ruler of Sind, did not give him a place in his own territory, but pointed out L\u0101h\u014dr to him as M. K\u0101mr\u0101n had gone towards Qandah\u0101r, and suggested that as such a rich country was unprotected he should go there. The ill-fated Mirz\u0101 came to L\u0101h\u014dr, thinking he had got an open field, and besieged it. Meanwhile M. K\u0101mr\u0101n arrived near L\u0101l\u014dr and beat the drum of superiority. M. Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n was disconcerted, and saw no resource except to return to Gujrat. Driven out and abandoned, he went there. In this year Mirz\u0101 \u1e24aidar G\u016brg\u0101n came from K\u0101shghar via Badakhsh\u0101n and joined M. K\u0101mr\u0101n in L\u0101h\u014dr. Next spring Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp came in person to the district of Qandah\u0101r, and Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n B\u0113g put all the wardrobes, pantries and other offices in order and sent the keys of the store-houses and of the fort to the Sh\u0101h, saying that he had no means of holding the fort and was unable to give battle, and that it was inconsistent with loyalty and his duties as a servant to his master that he should come and do homage to the Sh\u0101h. Hence he thought it proper to set his houses in order and to make them over to his guest and for himself to withdraw. He then went by way of Tatta and Ucc to L\u0101h\u014dr. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n for a month would not allow him to pay his respects, saying \"Why could you not have waited till I arrived?\" After various transactions M. K\u0101mr\u0101n made his preparations and marched against Qandah\u0101r for the second time, leaving M. \u1e24aidar in charge of L\u0101h\u014dr. Before this Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp had put Bid\u0101gh Kh\u0101n Qaj\u0101r, one of the great officers, in charge of Qandah\u0101r.\n\n1 Tar. Rash., 467. He came from Tibet and Badakhsh\u0101n.\n2 In Bah\u0101walp\u0101r, Panj\u0101b, 10 miles S. S. W. Mult\u0101n. Spelt \u0100ch in text but corrected in errata.\n3 Qac\u0101r in text, but with variant Qaj\u0101r. It is the present royal family of Persia. It is curious that Tahm\u0101sp should have, apparently, employed the same Bid\u0101gh Kh\u0101n again and sent him with his infant son to accompany Hum\u0101y\u016bn. \u1e24aidar Mirz\u0101 (Tar. Rash., 405), remarks on the curious readiness with which Bid\u0101gh Kh\u0101n surrendered to K\u0101mr\u0101n, and he does not seem to have been more efficient when attacked by Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\nand had departed. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n arrived and laid siege to Qandah\u0101r, and Bid\u0101gh Kh\u0101n capitulated and retreated. The M\u012brz\u0101 got possession of Qandah\u0101r, and after putting it into a condition of defence returned to L\u0101h\u014dr.\n\nWhither have my words strayed? It is certainly better that I withdrew my hand from these affairs and attach myself to the thread of my design.\n\nWhen his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was encamped at Cambay with a small force Malik Ahmad L\u0101d and Rukn D\u0101\u016bd who were officers of Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, and leading men in K\u014dliw\u0101ra, arranged with the K\u014dlis and Gaw\u0101rs\u00b9 of that country that as there were few men with his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b there was a suitable opportunity for making a night attack. They accordingly made preparations. By good fortune an old woman who had heard of this came to the royal enclosure and told one of the attendants that she had urgent business and wished to have a personal interview. As she was very importunate and appeared to be honest she was admitted to the presence, and communicated the plot of the night attack. His Majesty said \u201cWhence comes this well-wishing of yours.\u201d She replied \u201cMy son has been confined by one of your servants and I want him released as a reward for this well-wishing. If I have spoken falsely, punish both me and my son.\u201d In accordance with orders, her son was produced, and a guard placed over them both. As a measure of precaution the troops were got into readiness and drawn off. Near dawn 5 or 6,000 Bhils and Gaw\u0101rs fell upon the royal enclosures, his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and the troops having retired to a rising ground. The Gaw\u0101ns came and proceeded to plunder, and many rare books, which were real companions and were always kept in his Majesty\u2019s personal possession, were lost. Among these was the Tim\u016br-n\u0101ma,\u00b2 trans-\n\n\u00b9 Text Kaw\u0101r\u0101n, but corrected in errata.\n\u00b2 Ers. II. 62n. supposes that this was the Zafarn\u0101ma of Sharafu-d-d\u012bn. This may be so but Tim\u016br-n\u0101ma is properly the title of a poem by H\u0101t\u012bff, i.e., \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h, the sister\u2019s son of J\u0101m\u012b. See Rieu II, 652 and B\u0101b\u0101r\u2019s Memoirs, 196. Ers. takes A.F. to mean that the very copy that was lost was recovered, but A.F. does not clearly say so, and the words \u201chaving been recovered\u201d quoted by Ers. do not occur in the text. Probably all that A.F. means is that there is now a Tim\u016br-n\u0101ma in the imperial library. It is rather grotesque that A.F. should\nscribed by Mull\u0101 Sult\u0101n \u2018Ali and illustrated by Ust\u0101d Bihz\u0101d, and which is now in the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h\u2019s library. To sum up in a short space of time the breeze of salvation\u2019s morn breathed from fortune\u2019s ascension, and the brave warriors turned upon that mob and discomfited and scattered those hapless wretches by discharges of arrows. That old woman\u2019s face was brightened, and she gained her desire. The majesty of the royal wrath, and the onslaught of o\u2019ermastering rage boiled over and an order was issued for plundering and burning Cambay. After that the pursuit of Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur was abandoned, and the army returned to Campanir. The fortress was besieged for four months. Ikhtiy\u0101r Kh\u0101n, who was sprung from a family of Q\u0101z\u012bs in Nari\u0101d which is a town in that country, and who was, for his justice and ability one of the Sult\u0101n\u2019s, confidants brought great exertions to bear on the defence of the fort. In addition to all these call books Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s companions just at the time when he left them behind to be plundered. In Blochmann, 108, mention is made of an illustrated Zafarn\u0101ma, but this was one executed in Akbar\u2019s reign, and from the remark on the preceding page that Akbar had pictures worthy of Bihz\u0101d, it would appear that he had not any by Bihz\u0101d himself. Bihz\u0101d was a famous painter of Sult\u0101n Husain Her\u0101t\u012b\u2019s Court. See B\u0101b\u0101r, 197, who criticises his style of portraying youthful beauty. Blochmann, 1072, says that Bihz\u0101d lived at the Court of Sh\u0101h Ismail \u0160\u0101fi, and he may have done so subsequently. Sult\u0101n \u2018Ali Mashhad\u012b was, according to B\u0101b\u0101r, 197, the best writer of the nast\u0101l\u012bq character. See also Blochmann, 101. It seems probable that Hum\u0101y\u016bn inherited this book from his father, for he had not yet been to Persia himself. The Tim\u0101rn\u0101ma of H\u0101t\u012bf\u012b, it may be remarked, is a poem in imitation of one of Nig\u0101m\u012b\u2019s and more likely to be illustrated than the somewhat ponderous and prosaic Zafarn\u0101ma.\n\n1 Sh\u012bba, unnecessarily corrected in Errata to shapa, i.e., whizzing. See Richardson l.c. 559a and Vullers 490a.\n\n3 See Elliot V, 193 and Erskine II. 62n. \u1e62adr Kh\u0101n was killed in the attack by the G\u0101w\u0101rs.\n\n5 See description of fort by Col. Miles, Bom. L. S. Transactions I. 150 (reprint of 1877). He spells the name Champaneer.\n\n4 Nirb\u0101d in text, but corrected in Errata. It was a district in Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d Sarkar, Jarrett II, 253, and is now a station on the Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d railway. Also a place on the sea-shore in the Surat Sirk\u0101r, Jarrett, l.c., 257.\n\nErskine understands A.F. as meaning that this arrangement about drawing up provisions was made by Ikhtiy\u0101r Kh\u0101n. But I doubt if this is correct. A.F. seems to mean that in addition to all\nprotections and precautions it happened that from time to time sundry mountaineering (k\u016bh-naward) woodcutters entered by ravines, which from the density of trees and jungle were difficult for foot passengers to traverse, and of course impracticable for traffic, and for the sake of gain brought corn and ghee to the foot of the fort in order to sell them at a high price, while men in the fort let down money by ropes and drew up the goods.\n\nAs the siege was long drawn out his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b would sometimes visit the different sides of the fort and search for a possible entrance for his army. On one occasion he went forward from the side of H\u0101lul, which is a garden, and fell in with the people who were coming out of the jungle after selling their corn and butter. An order was given to find out what their business was. They said they were woodcutters, but as they had no axes or hatchets with them, their story was not accepted. They were told that they would not escape punishment unless they told the truth. Being helpless they confessed the truth. Upon this they were bidden to go forward and to point out the place. When his Majesty saw it he recognised that it was 60 or 70 yards \\(^1\\) high and very smooth,\\(^2\\) so that it would be very difficult to climb. By his Majesty\u2019s orders 70 or 80 iron nails were brought, and driven into the precipice right and left at distances of one yard. The young heroes were bid climb these degrees of daring (mi\u2019r\u0101j-i-mard\u0101nag\u012b). Thirty-nine had ascended when his Majesty himself wished to climb. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n begged him to delay till the men ahead had got higher up. Saying this he himself stepped up, his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b followed him and was the 41st. Standing\n\n---\n\nIkhtiy\u0101r\u2019s plans there was this favourable circumstance that the garrison were supplied by the K\u014dlls. Both Fir\u016bghta and the Mir\u2018\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b, Bayley, 391, represent that there was plenty of food in the fort, and the former evidently takes the view that the fort was captured owing to the greed of the K\u014dlls in selling provisions to the garrison and which led to Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s exploit. A.F. is favourable to Ikhtiy\u0101r Kh\u0101n, perhaps on account of his literary abilities, but Bah\u0101dur is said to have had a very low opinion of him, Bayley, 391.\n\n\\(^1\\) Gaz. The exact length does not seem known, but probably was about 33 inches, Jarrett II, 58, and Wilson\u2019s Glossary.\n\n\\(^2\\) Hamw\u0101r\u012b. The Brit. Mus. MSS. have the opposite of this, viz., n\u0101hamw\u0101r\u012b, but hamw\u0101r\u012b is probably right.\n\n\\(^3\\) i.e., about 300 in all, not 341, see what follows.\nthere he had about 300 men drawn up by this iron ladder. An order was given that the victorious army, which was stationed at the batteries, should attack the fort. The garrison were thrown off their guard, and addressed themselves to repel the men from without and were looking down from the battlements when suddenly the 300 braves came from behind, and overwhelmed the garrison with showers of arrows. And when they realised the fact that his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b in person had ascended the stairs of victory, the bewildered foe crept into hiding-places. The drum of victory beat high, and Ikhtiy\u0101r Kh\u0101n went off to a higher point called M\u016bliya and there took refuge. Next day they gave him quarter and sent for him. Together with his practical knowledge (d\u0101nish) and his management of state affairs he was fully possessed of sciences, especially mathematics and astronomy. He was also skilled as a poet and composer of enigmas. He was honoured by being allowed to sit in the assembly of the learned, and was distinguished by princely favours, and was admitted among the intimates of the threshold of sovereignty. One of the eloquent found the date of this victory \"Awwal hafta-i-M\u0101h-i-\u1e62afar,\" i.e., first week of \u1e62afar (943)=19th\u201326th July, 1536.\n\nAs the country of Gujr\u0101t was in the possession of the servants of the empire up to the Mahindri, and as no one was appointed to administer the territory on the other side (the West), the peasantry wrote to Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur and announced that the collections were ready and that a collector of these was necessary; if one were appointed, they would discharge their obligations. All the officers to whom the Sult\u0101n spoke on the subject remained silent. \u2018Im\u0101du-l-Mulk however had the courage to come forward, and he agreed to accept the office on condition that there should be no questioning afterwards.\n\n---\n\n1 In Jarrett II, 256, the upper fort is called P\u0101wah, but according to Miles Bom. L. S. T. I. 152 (reprint) the proper spelling is Pavanagada, wind-fort.\n\n2 The text has mah, but unless we read m\u0101h the abjad seems to be incorrect, being 942 instead of 943. Erskine VI, 64. B\u0101daoni, Brit. Ind.-I, 347, has another chronogram \"Nuh Shahr-i-\u1e62afar b\u016bd\" according to which the fort was taken on 9 \u1e62afar, 942, or 9th August, 1535. But \u1e62afar is only the second month of the Mu\u1e25ammadan year, and the operations at Cambay, and the length of the siege seem to require 943.\n\n3 Also called the Mahi I. G. T. V.\nas to any land or authority that he should give to any one in order to execute the work of the collection. He proceeded with 200 horse towards Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d. On the way he gave written grants,\\(^1\\) of land to those whom he knew. When he arrived at Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d he had collected 10,000 cavalry. He gave everyone who possessed two horses a *lak* of *gujr\u0101t\u012bs*. In a short time he had gathered 30,000 cavalry. Muj\u0101hid Kh\u0101n, Governor of J\u016bnagadh joined him with 10,000 horse.\n\nAt this time his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b on account of the conquest of the fort of C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br and of the falling of abundant treasure into his hands was holding magnificent banquets and was constantly arranging royal entertainments on the banks of the D\u016b R\u016bya tank. One of the paramount conditions of authority is that special servants and those in near attendance should have certain fixed rules to abide by, and that in every section of them there should be some discreet and prudent person appointed who may continually look after their rising and sitting, their going and coming, and take precautions against evil companionship, which is the father and mother of wrong ideas. Especially is this required at a time when details are veiled from a Lord of the Age by the multiplicity of business. It is fitting that in such circumstances he should appoint right-speaking, right-acting intelligencers who may always bring him correct information of the real state and of the gist of the doings of this body of men. Otherwise many of the narrow-minded become from length of service less susceptible of the prestige of royalty, and the wine of familiarity carries them out of their senses, and leads them into the stumbling of eternal ruin. And great seditions emerge from this intoxication. Accordingly they became apparent on this occasion. The story of this is that on the night of the rejoicing and banquetings on account of the marvellous victories, some feeble souls who were fated to be admitted to the verge of the sublime assemblage, viz., book-bearers, armour-bearers, ink-horn-bearers and the like, happened to have gone to the gardens of \u1e24al\u012bl,\\(^2\\) the scent of whose flowers might cure the melancholy, and whose heart-expanding breeze might give motion to congealed\\(^3\\) blood, and to have started a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Maw\u0101jib* fiefs.

See Vullers I. 759.\nwinefeast. In this state of exultation which had put to flight sense and reason, they took up the Zafarn\u0101ma and read of the beginnings of the victorious career of his Majesty \u0160\u0101hib Qir\u0101n\u012b (Tim\u016br)\u2014how that prince had with him, in the vernal prime of his glory, forty chosen companions, and how one day he took from each a couple of arrows and after tying them all together, gave them to each companion to break. Though each put the bundle across his knee and exerted all his strength, it was of no use. But when he opened the bundle, and gave each two arrows every one broke them. His Majesty had then observed \"we are forty persons, if we are united like this bundle of arrows victory will attend us wherever we go.\" In accordance with this right thought and lofty idea they girt up their loins of courage and went forth to conquer.\n\nThose ignorant fools when they heard this story did not reflect that each one of the forty was a heaven-aided host. They thought merely of the external circumstances and so fell into ruinous imaginings. When they reckoned themselves up they found they were four hundred, and in their madness and folly they conceived that unanimity among 400 persons must be exceeding wrong, and formed the notion of conquering the Deccan. Under this hallucination they proceeded to tread the broad and downward path to destruction. Next day though search was made for those near yet so far (nazd\u012bk\u0101n-i-d\u016br), no trace of them could be found. At last an intimation of their wild idea was obtained, and a thousand men were sent to seize them. They soon brought to Court those fortune-buffeted and doomed men, bound neck and hand. It was Tuesday, a day when his Majesty wore the red vesture of Mars and sate on the throne of wrath and vengeance. The crowd of criminals were brought forward, section by section, and each of them received sentences fitting\n\n---\n\n1 I have not found this story in Sharafu-d-d\u012bn though at I. 75, Bibl. Ind. ed. there is an allusion to Tim\u016br's having forty followers. The same story is told of Cangiz Kh\u0101n who when on his deathbed used the illustration of weapons tied together and separate, to teach the necessity of union to his sons. See Petit de la Croix's life, quoted by Erdmann 639, and 442.\n\n2 Hum\u0101y\u016bn assigned particular days of the week to certain duties. Thus Monday being Mars-day, was one of that assigned to the administration of Criminal Justice. See extract from Khw\u0101nd Am\u012br in Elliot V. 121 and A. F.'s text I. 358 and 361\ntheir destiny, and the requirements of complete justice. Some they bound and made trodden under the feet of mountain-like elephants. Many who had carried their heads beyond the line of respect received distinction by the removal of the burden of their heads from their bodies. A number who, not distinguishing between their feet and their hands, had clapped their hands at seditious thoughts were made handless and footless. A set of them who from arrogance (khud-bini lit. self-contemplation) had not kept their ears for the royal commands found ears and nose gone from their places, others who had laid the fingertip of intent on the edge of misfeasance saw no more the figure of a finger in their hand.\n\nAfter executing these judgments and orders the time of evening prayer arrived. The Im\u0101m, who was not void of obtuseness, at the first genuflection recited the S\u016bra \u2018A-lam tara kaifa\u2019 \u201cHast thou not seen how.\u201d After the conclusion of the service the order of vengeance was issued that the Im\u0101m be thrown under the foot of an elephant because he had designedly and allusively recited the chapter of the elephant, and had degraded justice to tyranny, and had uttered an evil presage. Maul\u0101n\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Pargh\u0101l\u012b represented that the Im\u0101m did not know the meaning of the Qur\u0101n. But as the fire of wrath was darting tongues of flame he got no reply except abusive\n\n1 Erskine justly remarks that these details are very disgusting, and exhibit the wretched punning propensity of our James I., but on an occasion when it is not ridiculous but revolting. The sentences pronounced depend on idiomatic Persian phrases, hardly translatable. A. F.\u2019s poor wit may be paralleled by a too-famous passage in Paradise Lost, B. VI., but at least it may be said that Milton puts his jests into the mouths of devils.\n\n2 \u1e24ukm-i-gard\u016bn-intiq\u0101m, lit., the order of the sphere of vengeance. Vullers s.v. quotes the Bah\u0101r-i-\u2018\u0100jam as giving gard\u016bn the meaning of executioners.\n\n3 Apparently the f\u0101l-i-bad was that Hum\u0101y\u016bn would be destroyed like the impious king of Yaman. Is it possible that Hum\u0101y\u016bn thought the Im\u0101m was playing on the word kaifa, which in Persian means intoxication, and was suggesting that he was drunk? As Erskine remarks, the S\u016bra does not seem to contain much matter of offence. Probably however the reference to the elephant was enough.\n\n4 It is pleasant to find this man, of whom Haidar Mirz\u0101 speaks so ill, Tar. Rash. 398, acting properly and courageously. He was afterwards drowned at Causa.\nepithets. After a time when the light of the Im\u00e2m\u2019s simplicity shone on the marge of his holy heart and the conflagration of the flames of wrath was stayed, he expressed much regret and spent the whole night in sorrow and weeping.\n\nAfter the completion of this affair Tardi B\u00e9g Kh\u00e2n was left in C\u00e2mp\u00e2n\u00eer, and the royal standards proceeded towards Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e2d, and encamped on the bank of the Mahindri. Im\u00e2du-l-Mulk had the courage to advance, and to make a march for each one that the royal army made. Between Nari\u00fbd and Mahm\u00fbd\u00e1b\u00e2d he encountered Mirz\u00e2 \u2018Askari who was in the van and several stages ahead (of the main body). A great battle ensued, and the Mirz\u00e2 was worsted until Y\u00e2dg\u00e2r N\u00e2s\u00eer Mirz\u00e2, Q\u00e2sim Husain Kh\u00e2n and Hind\u00fb B\u00e9g arrived with a large body of men and unfurling the flag of fortune proclaimed to the enemy the approach of the imperial ensigns with a \u201cLo, the sublime army has arrived.\u201d The utterance of this word, and its sound reaching the ears of the enemy were simultaneous with Y\u00e2dg\u00e2r N\u00e2s\u00eer Mirz\u00e2\u2019s victory and the defeat of the foe. As Y\u00e2dg\u00e2r N\u00e2s\u00eer Mirz\u00e2 was ahead of all, the brunt of the battle fell upon him. On the side of the enemy \u2018\u00c2lam Kh\u00e2n L\u00fbd\u00ee and some others offered opposition till Im\u00e2du-l-mulk retired half dead. Darwesh Muhammed Qar\u00e2sh\u00eer, father of Shuj\u00e2t Kh\u00e2n, obtained martyrdom in this engagement. Meanwhile the flashing of the royal standards appeared and victory upon victory disclosed itself. After the arrival of the sublime army 3 to 4,000 of the enemy were slain. His Majesty\n\n---\n\n1 A.F. does not clearly say that the order to trample the Imam to death was carried out, but Erskine says it was, and A. F.\u2019s silence implies this. Had Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn repented in time, we should have had a flourish of trumpets about the imperial clemency.\n\n2 Or Mahl. C\u00e2mp\u00e2n\u00eer is upwards of 60 miles E. S. E. Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e2d, but is visible from the minaret of the Jama\u2019 Masjid, Miles.\n\n3 Jarrett II. 241, now a station on the Bomb. Baroda and Central I. Ry. It lies south-east of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e2d and is, as A.F. states, nearly half-way between Nari\u00fbd (apart Nadiaid in time-tables) being 11 miles from Nari\u00fbd and 10 from Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e2d.\n\n4 It does not appear who this \u2018\u00c2lam Kh\u00e2n is. He can hardly be the man who was mutilated at C\u00e2mp\u00e2n\u00eer and yet possibly he is. If he was the No. III of Bayluy then his real name was Safdar Kh\u00e2n and he was perhaps not a L\u00fbd\u00ee at all. See p. 329.\n\n5 Also called Muq\u00eem-i-\u2018Arab. Blochmann, 371.\nasked Khud\u0101wand Kh\u0101n\\(^1\\) if there was likelihood of another battle, and he replied that if that leprous slave, meaning \u2018Im\u0101du-l-mulk, had been personally in the fight, it was over, and if he had not been there was likelihood of another bloody bout. Men were appointed to inquire into this matter, and from two wounded men, who were lying half dead among the dead, it was ascertained that \u2018Im\u0101du-l-mulk had commanded in person. Next day the grand army marched on and then halted, M. \u2018Askari going on as before in front. When the army had encamped on this side of the Kank\u0101riy\u0101\\(^2\\) tank M. \u2018Askari represented that if the whole camp entered the city, the inhabitants would be harassed. An order was given that provost-marshals (yas\u0101wal\u0101n) be stationed at every gate of the city and that they should admit no one except M. \u2018Askari and his men.\n\nThe army encamped on the delightful spot of Sark\u0101j, and on the third day his Majesty, attended by many of his courtiers, came to the city. After that he gave his attention to the affairs of Gujr\u0101t and settled them in a proper manner. Hind\u016b B\u0113g was stationed there with a large force in order that he might go wherever he was required. Pattan was given to M\u012brz\u0101 Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir; Broach, Nans\u0101r\u012b and the port of Surat to Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n;\\(^3\\) Cambay, and Baroda to D\u014dst B\u0113g Ishak \u0100q\u0101; and Ma\u1e25m\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d to M\u012br B\u016bc\u0101ka.\n\nWhen the affairs of Gujr\u0101t had been settled his Majesty proceeded towards the port of Diu. When the army was leaving Dand\u016bqa, which is 30 k\u014ds (W. S. W.) from A\u1e25mad\u0101b\u0101d, representations came from Agra, the capital, to the effect that as his Majesty was far from the seat of Government rebellious men had raised the head of disaffection, and extended the arm of strife. Couriers too\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is probably the Waz\u012br and not R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n. The expression used by him about \u2018Im\u0101du-l-mulk may refer to his being a Circasian (according to Fir\u012bghta) and to his grandfather's having been a slave. Bayley 233, 235. Fir\u012bghta says he was the son of a Cangiz Kh\u0101n.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Tiefenthaler I. 378, who states that in his time the tank was nearly dried up. It was cleared out by Mr. Borrodaile in 1872.

His Majesty thereupon determined to return and to make M\u0101nd\u016b his capital for a time, so that M\u0101lw\u0101 might be cleared of rebels, and also that the newly conquered Gujr\u0101t might be brought into order, and also that the flames of disaffection which had blazed forth in the settled portion of the empire might be extinguished. Accordingly having made over Gujr\u0101t to M. \u2018Askari and a number of officers he turned his rein and halted at Cambay. From thence he went to Baroda and Broach and from thence to Surat, and from thence to \u0100s\u012br\u00b3 and Burh\u0101np\u016br. He stopped seven days in Burh\u0101np\u016br and then marched on and passing under the fort of \u0100s\u012br established himself at M\u0101nd\u016b. As soon as the disaffected heard the sound of the return of the royal standards, they were troubled and crept into corners. His Majesty found the climate of M\u0101lw\u0101 agreeable to his constitution and made many of his servants j\u0101gird\u0101rs thereof. And the gates of success and satisfaction of desires were thrown open to the world.\n\n\u00b9 Apparently the Governor of S\u012bw\u0101s who was afterwards killed with Bah\u0101dur at Diu, Bayley 849, &c.\n\u00b2 In H\u014dshang\u0101b\u0101d, Central Prov.\n\u00b3 \u0100s\u012brgarh in Nim\u0101r, Central Provinces.\n\nI.

The story of the doings of M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Askar\u012b and the officers of Gujrat is a proof of this, for owing to the smallness of their capacities a little success made them give way to rebellious thoughts. From immoderate living there arose the beginnings of mutual strife and their actions were darkened by the mist of dissimulation. Accordingly after about three months the enemy stirred up commotion. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n of Sh\u012br\u0101z and R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n, who had the name of \u1e62afar and who is the builder of the fort of Surat, united and took possession of Naus\u0101r\u012b which was held by \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n, a relative of Q\u0101sim Husain Kh\u0101n \u00dczb\u0113g. \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n left that quarter and came to Broach. About this time they also took the port of Surat. Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n marched by land to Broach, while R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n came there by sea with warships carrying guns and muskets. Q\u0101sim Husain Kh\u0101n lost his head (lit. lost hands and feet), and hurried to C\u0101mp\u0101n\u016br, and then from there went on to A\u1e25mad\u0101b\u0101d to M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Askar\u012b and Hind\u016b B\u0113g in search of help. Sayyid Ishaq who had received 143 from Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur the title of Shit\u0101b Kh\u0101n (the swift Kh\u0101n) took possession of Cambay, and Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 went off from Pattan to Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d at the summons of \u2018Askar\u012b Mirza. Dary\u0101 Kh\u0101n and Mu\u1e25\u0101fi\u1e93 Kh\u0101n set out from R\u0101\u012bsin and were going towards the Sult\u0101n at Diu, when finding Pattan empty (i.e., undefended), they took possession of it. From want of union and want of counsel things came to such a pass that one Ghazanfar (the lion), a\n\n---\n\n1 A proverbial expression. See Roebuck's Oriental Proverbs, Part I.

He invited the Sultan to come (to Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d) and letters of loyalists followed in succession, so that Sultan Bah\u0101dur marched towards Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, and soon halted near Sark\u0113j. \u2018Askar\u012b M\u012brz\u0101, Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br M\u012brz\u0101, Hind\u016b B\u0113g, and Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Kh\u0101n proceeded with nearly 20,000 horse and confronted the Sultan in the rear of As\u0101wal. They faced him for three days and nights, and then, as they were neither loyal to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b nor clear-headed they, out of a darkened understanding and evil thoughts, went off without fighting to C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br. Much mischief ensued.\n\n'Tis evident how far they carried the eating of the salt and the breaking the salt-cellar on the table-top\u00b9 and how in the domain of thanksgiving they trod the arena of crime and the field of little service. Good God, I understand their lack of fidelity, which is a priceless jewel and of rare occurrence in this wicked world, but why should they drop from their hands the coin of common sense which is negotiable everywhere? In fine, Sultan Bah\u0101dur who had been in a thousand anxieties, grew bold and pursued them. Sayyid Mub\u0101rak of Bukh\u0101r\u0101 was at the head of the vanguard and came near the imperial army. Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br M\u012brz\u0101 who commanded in the rear turned and fought bravely with the result that many of the Sultan\u2019s vanguard were killed, while the M\u012brz\u0101 was wounded in the arm. The enemy halted at Mahm\u016bd\u0101b\u0101d, and the M\u012brz\u0101 joined the main army. As M. \u2018Askar\u012b had lost heart he incontinently crossed the Mahindri which was in front of him, and many of the soldiers lost their lives in its floods. The Sultan arrived at the edge of the river and the M\u012brz\u0101 went on to C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br. Tard\u012b B\u0113g Kh\u0101n made arrangements for their entertainment, and then went back to his post.\n\nNext day the M\u012brz\u0101s sent a treacherous message to Tard\u012b B\u0113g Kh\u0101n to the effect that they were in distress, and their army in evil case, and begged that he would send them by way of assistance a portion of the fort treasures in order that they might give it to their soldiers. When they had refreshed themselves, they would use diligence to attack the enemy. They were reporting to M\u0101nd\u016b, where the imperial camp was, but it would take a courier six days to\n\n\u00b9 A proverbial expression. Cf. p. 392, No. 2129 and Vullers, s. v.

Tard\u012b B\u0113g Kh\u0101n did not consent to this, and the Mirz\u0101s plotted to seize him so that they might get hold of the whole of the treasure, and establish the sovereignty in the name of M. \u2018Askar\u012b. If they defeated Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur so much the better, but if not, as his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b liked the M\u0101lw\u0101 climate, and the territory of Agra, the capital, was undefended, they would go there. Tard\u012b B\u0113g Kh\u0101n came down from the fort and was going to wait upon the Mirz\u0101s when he got wind of this plot. He hastened back to the fort and sent word to the Mirz\u0101s that it was not fitting for them to remain there. They sent back a message that they were leaving, but asked him to come that they might discuss sundry matters with him and bid him farewell. He knew their design and returned a suitable answer, and next morning opened fire on them. The Mirz\u0101s went off with evil intentions and proceeded by Gh\u0101t Karj\u012b towards Agra. So long as the victorious (?) army was in the neighbourhood of C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br the Sult\u0101n did not cross the Mahindri which is 15 k\u014ds from C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br. But when news came that the Mirz\u0101s had retreated and gone off towards Agra with evil designs, the Sult\u0101n crossed the river and came to attack C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br. Tard\u012b B\u0113g Kh\u0101n, in spite of the strength of the fort, and the store of preparations there abandoned the fort and took the road of safety. He reached M\u0101nd\u016b and had the honour of paying his respects. He made known to his Majesty the Mirz\u0101s\u2019 evil intentions and his Majesty on being apprized thereof hastened by way of Cit\u014dr so that the Mirz\u0101s might not get to Agra before him. By good fortune he came up with them on the way, near Cit\u014dr. The helpless Mirz\u0101s submitted to his Majesty and he out of innate kindness and clemency did not regard their offences and made universal forgiveness, the intercessor for their faults. He made liberality to supplement forgiveness and distinguished them by princely gifts.\n\nOne of the evils of the time which were the cause of his Majesty\u2019s returning from this country to Agra was that Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n Mirz\u0101 and his son Ulugh Mirz\u0101, who had deviated from the affairs, viz., that he had been living at M\u0101nd\u016b or Sh\u0101dt\u0101b\u0101d (abode of joy) as it was called, and had been enslaved by opium.\n\n---\n\n1 I have not found this place.\n2 Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, Bib. Ind. I, 80, and Ferigha give the real reason of the disastrous change in Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s affairs, viz., that he had been living at M\u0101nd\u016b or Sh\u0101dt\u0101b\u0101d (abode of joy) as it was called, and had been enslaved by opium.\nhighway of obedience and become rebellious, as has been already mentioned, emerged at this time, owing to their constitutional weakness, from the corner of contempt and raised the head of molestation. Thus did those who had been appointed to blind him receive lesson. They now attacked pargana Bilgram and then proceeded to Qanauj. The sons of Khusrau Kokaltash, who were there as quarter and yielded up Qanauj to them. M. Hindal who was in Agra went forth to quell this disturbance, and the two armies met after he had crossed the Ganges at Bilgram. A battle ensued, and as the vogue of rebels and strife mongers is like a grass-fire the flames were extinguished in a moment by the blowing of Fortune's gale. The north wind of victory blew and the victorious army pursued and came to Oudh. There Ulugh Beg M. and his sons had gathered an army and again offered battle. Meanwhile the news came of the arrival of the victorious army from Gujr\u00e2t to Agra. The wretched enemy again fought and were again defeated. Mirza Hindal returned victorious and kissed the sublime threshold. When the grand army of his Majesty Jah\u00e2nb\u00e2ni arrived at Agra Bh\u00fbp\u00e2l Rai, governor of Bijagada (in Nimar), finding the fort of Mandu undefended boldly entered it, and Q\u00e2dir Sh\u00e2h returned to Mandu, and also Mirza Muhammad Faruqi came there from Burhanpur. Sultan Bahadur after staying about two weeks in C\u00e2mp\u00e2nir returned to Diu. When his Majesty Jah\u00e2nb\u00e2ni and the invincible fortune of his family had turned away from Bahadur with glories of power and majesty, an event which he thought to be to his advantage became the cause of his ruin. For after being routed by the victorious army, and after\n\n---\n\n1 At p. 124 of text A.F. says that M. Sultan was blinded, but here he seems to imply that the operation was not effectual. See Erskine II, 14. M. Sultan is a different person from M. Zam\u00e2n though both were grandsons of Sultan Hasan of Her\u00e2t. M. Sultan was a daughter's son, Blochmann, 462.\n\n2 In Hardoi, a district of Oudh, Jarrett 173, 178 and 145 and I. G.

See also Erskine II, 90.\n\n5 Qr. the town of Ayodhya.\n\n6 Apparently the meaning is that Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn's departure which Bahadur might think an advantage eventually turned out to be his destruction by leading to his death at the hands of the Portuguese.\nbeholding the impact of the majestic troops he sent persons with presents to the Feringhi Viceroy who was the Warden of the Ports, and invited him to come to him. At the time when M. 'Askari went off from Gujr\u00e1t and the Sult\u00e1n had come to Diu, the Viceroy arrived there by sea with ships and soldiers. When he learned the state of affairs he grew apprehensive, lest now that the Sult\u00e1n was independent of his help he would act perfidiously after an interview. He therefore feigned illness and sent messengers to the Sult\u00e1n to say that he had come in compliance with his request and would wait upon him as soon as he was better. The Sult\u00e1n left the highway of caution and on 3 Rama\u1e93an 943 (13th February, 1537), at the close of the day, went by boat to inquire after the Viceroy's health. As soon as he arrived he saw that the illness was feigned, and reporting that he had come he immediately proceeded to return. The Feringhis thought that \"when such a prey has come into our grasp it will be well if we get some harbours out of him.\" The Viceroy intercepted him and requested him to stay till some presents should be brought before him. The Sult\u00e1n said \"send them afterwards,\" and saying this he hastily went towards his own vessel. The Feringhi Q\u0101z\u012b stopped him and bade him wait and the Sult\u00e1n impatiently drew his sword and clove him to the waist. He then jumped from their vessel on to his own. The Portuguese boats which were round about closed in upon her and a fight began. The Sult\u00e1n and R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n flung themselves into the sea. A Feringhi acquaintance of R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n drew him out, but the Sult\u00e1n was drowned,* and his attendants also perished. The chrono-\n\n---\n\n1 representing the Portuguese Viserei. His name was Nuno da Cunha.\n\n2 Apparently Manuel de Sousa, Governor of Diu. Q\u0101z\u012b seems used here for Magistrate or Governor.\n\n3 This R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n was himself an European, which may account for his being saved by a Portuguese. Barros says he was the son of an Albanian father and an Italian mother and was born at Brindisi, and first came to the east on the fleet of the corsair Sulaim\u0101n in 1516 (Conti says his birthplace was Otranto). He built the fort of Surat, apparently in 947 and not in 930, as stated by Anquetil du Perron. See Blochmann, 354. The Portuguese called him Khw\u0101ja \u1e62afar and \u1e62afar \u0100gh\u0101. He was killed at the siege of Diu in 1546.\n\n4 The accounts of Bah\u0101dur's death are very conflicting, and it is difficult to decide how he came by his death. My friend Mr. Whiteway has refer-\ngram is Faringiy\u0101n-i-Bah\u0101dur-kh\u0101l\u012b (943=1531). And some used to say that he (Bah\u0101dur) came to the surface and reached the shore in safety. And subsequently there were reports in Gujrat and the Deccan of his having been seen by people. For instance, on one occasion a person appeared in the Deccan whom the Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-l-Mulk acknowledged, and played Caug\u0101n (polo) with. A crowd gathered round him, and the Ni\u1e93\u0101m perceiving this resolved to put him to death. On that same night he disappeared from his tent, and people concluded that the Ni\u1e93\u0101m had destroyed him. One day M\u012br Ab\u016b Tur\u0101b who is one of the Gujrat grandees, related that Mull\u0101 Qutb\u0101-d-d\u012bn of Shiraz, who was Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur's preceptor, was at that time in the Deccan and that he took an oath that the man was certainly Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur, and that he had spoken to him of certain matters only known to themselves, and had received intelligent replies. It cannot be said that in the wide kingdom of God's power such things are impossible.\n\nIn fine, when Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur had thus disappeared in the sea, and his officers were sitting in the dust (i.e., were in mourning).\n\nred me to a long and interesting account by Correa. Naturally this man puts the blame on Bah\u0101dur. It would be more satisfactory if we could get the official report on the occurrence which must surely be somewhere in the Portuguese archives. No doubt the responsibility of explaining Bah\u0101dur's death rests on the Portuguese for he was their guest or at least visitor, and was killed among their ships. There is a long account of the affair in the Mir\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b, p. 28 et seq. See also Bayley's Gujrat. There is this to be said for the Muhammadan chroniclers that they do not represent Bah\u0101dur as guiltless in the matter. They represent him as trying to outwit the Portuguese and anxious to get the viceroy into his power. They are therefore more honest than the Portuguese who try to make out that Bah\u0101dur went on board to kill the viceroy and that the Portuguese were altogether blameless. Probably the truth is that Bah\u0101dur went on board in order to induce the viceroy to return with him, that the viceroy on the other hand wanted to detain him, and that then a scuffle arose in which Bah\u0101dur was slain. It is curious that the Mir\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b does not mention \u1e62af\u0101r \u0100gh\u0101 in his list of Bah\u0101dur's companions, and that he says they all likewise perished.\n\n1 \"Feringis, slayers of Bah\u0101dur\" (or \"of heroes\"). A more poetical chronogram was devised by Ikhtiy\u0101r-Kh\u0101n, viz., Sult\u0101nu-l-bar\u2014Shahidu-l-bahr: \"Monarch ashore, Martyr asea.\" This also makes 943.\n\n2 Blochmann, 506.\nMu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n Mirz\u0101 put on blue clothes as mourning for the Sult\u0101n, and by hypocritical means got a portion of the treasures of Gujr\u0101t into his possession, while another portion fell into the hands of the Feringhis, and some was plundered. He also called himself the son\\(^1\\) of Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur\u2019s mother, and sometimes demanded from the Feringhis satisfaction for the murder, and sometimes secretly sent them large sums of money in order that they might use their influence in having him acknowledged as sovereign (lit. recite the Khutba in his name). So that for some days they read the Khutba in his name in the \u1e62af\u0101\\(^2\\) Mosque. And he for some time went about as an adventurer till at last \u2018Im\u0101du-l-mulk brought an army against him and defeated him. From thence he being helpless and ashamed cast a glance of hope towards kissing the threshold of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, as will be hereafter related in its proper place. But leaving such matters, to speak of which is to indulge in amplifications and rhetoric, I proceed to my proper subject.\n\nWhen his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jaunat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b arrived at the capital the audacious spirits of that neighbourhood who had raised the head of refractoriness, and extended the neck of dispute came into subjection and obedience, and made tribute the material of their own peace and safety. The dominions became adorned with repose and steadfastness.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Mir\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b 293.\n\n\\(^2\\) I do not know where this is. The Mir\u0101t-i-Sikandar\u012b lith. ed., p. 293, says that M. Zam\u0101n was near \u016anah which is 3 kos from Diu, and that he there set himself up as Sult\u0101n. \u016anah is referred to in Jarrett II, 244 and 247 and 258. See also I. G. art. Una. The Mir\u0101t says \u2018Im\u0101du-l-mulk defeated M. Zam\u0101n-at-Zam\u0101r in Surat (K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r) near \u016anah. Probably the mosque in question is in Diu for Mr. Whiteway tells me that the Portuguese authorities say that the Khutba was read for a time in M. Zam\u0101n\u2019s name in Diu.\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nMARCH OF HIS MAJESTY JAHANBAHI JANNAH-ASHIYANI TO SUBDUE BENGAL; HIS CONQUEST OF THAT COUNTRY AND RETURN TO THE CAPITAL, AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MEANWHILE.\n\nWhen the world-adorning mind had finished the affairs of those regions, (i.e., Agra and the territories referred to at end of last chapter) his princely genius addressed itself to the arrangements for an expedition to Gujr\u00e2t, so that he might again turn the reins of his intent towards that province and might, contrary to former dispositions, make over its management to men whose behaviour should show steadiness in administration, and whose proceedings should not be characterised by mutability and confusion. He purposed that when his mind was at ease with regard to the settlement of the province, he would return to the capital. Meanwhile news came of the emergence of Sh\u00e9r Kh\u00e2n and of his commotions in the eastern provinces. Hence the design of subduing Bengal, which had entered his Majesty\u2019s heart before the affairs of Gujr\u00e2t and had been put off on account of the latter now revived, and orders were issued to make preparations for an expedition to Bengal. It was decided that Sh\u00e9r Kh\u00e2n should be put down and the territories of Bengal subdued.\n\nACCOUNT OF SH\u00c9R KH\u00c2N.\u00b9\n\nThis Sh\u00e9r Kh\u00e2n belonged to the Afgh\u00e2n tribe of S\u00fbr. His old name was Farid, and he was the son of Hasan, the son of Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem Sh\u00e9rakhal\u00ee. Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem was a horse-dealer, nor had he any distinction among the crowd of tradesmen. His native country was the village\u2014\n\n\u00b9 A. F.'s. account is inferior to Nig\u0101mu-d-din's (copied by Fir\u016bghta) and to Kh\u0101fi Kh\u00e2n's. See also Dorn's History of the Afgh\u00e2ns, p. 80 et seq. and Gar\u00e7in de Tassy's translation of the Chronicle of Sh\u00e9r Sh\u00e2h.\nof Shamla in the territory of Narnul. His son Hasan developed some nobleness and from trading took to soldiering. For a long time he was in the service of Raimal, the grandfather of Raissal Darbari, who is at present honoured by being in the service of his Majesty the Shahshah. From there he went to Caund in the territory of Sahasram and became a servant of Nasir Khan Luhani who was an officer of Sikandar Lodi. By service and ability he surpassed his fellows, and when Nasir Khan died, he entered the service of his brother Daulat Khan. After that he was enrolled among the followers of Baban who was one of the grandees of Sultan Sikandar Lodi, and achieved a certain amount of distinction. Many things were accomplished by his management. His son Farid pained his own father by his arrogance and evil disposition, and separated from him. For a time he was in the service of Taj Khan Lodi and for a while he was in Oudh in the service of Qasim Husain Uzbak. For a long time he was servant of Sultan Junaid Barlas. One day Sultan Junaid Barlas had taken occasion to introduce him and two other Afghans who were in his service to his Majesty Giti-sitani Firdaus-makanii. As soon as the farseeing glance of his Majesty fell upon him he remarked \"Sultan Barlas, the eyes of this Afghan, (pointing to Farid) indicate turbulence and strife-mongering, he ought to be confined.\" He received the other two favourably. Farid got apprehensive on seeing his Majesty Giti-sitani's look, and fled before Sultan (Junaid) could make him over to his men. Meanwhile his father died and his property fell into his hands. In the territory of Sahasram, and in the jungles of Caund, which is a pargana of Rohtas, he began to give trouble by practising theft.\n\n1 Or Simla, according to some. A pencil note to Chalmers' MS. translation has Shamly 55 miles N. of Delhi.\n2 In the district of Agra. Jarrett, I, 193.\n3 Ba qadr rashdi paida karda.\n4 Blochmann, 419.\n5 The text has Jana.

In a short space of time he by craft and unrighteousness surpassed the rebels of the age. Accordingly Sultan Bah\u0101dur of Gujrat sent him a subsidy by the hands of merchants and summoned him to his side. Farid made the money into capital for sedition, and sent excuses for not going. He occupied himself in usurpations, attacks and in plundering towns and villages. In a short time many rascals and vagabonds gathered round him. Meanwhile the governor of Bih\u0101r who was one of the L\u016bh\u0101n\u012b nobles departed this life, and there was no one left to take up the thread of his duties. Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n and his vagabonds made a raid and got hold of much property. Then he returned to his own place, and suddenly attacked Ulugh M\u012brz\u0101, who was near Sirwa (Sir\u016b). By craft he got the better of him. From there he turned and attacked Benares, and when he had acquired troops and property he went to Patna and took possession of that country. He fought a battle at Sarajgarh which is the boundary of the territories of the ruler of Bengal, and won a victory. That country also came into his hands. For a year he carried on war against Nusrat Sh\u0101h, the ruler of Bengal, and for a long while he besieged Gaur.\n\nOne remarkable circumstance was that Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n came to hear of an eminent astrologer in the service of the R\u0101j\u0101 of Orissa. As he had vain and rebellious thoughts he sent for this astrologer to get information about his success. The R\u0101j\u0101 would not let him go, but the astrologer wrote to Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n that he would not prevail over Bengal till the lapse of a year, and that he would prevail on a particular day, on which the Ganges would be fordable for an hour.\n\nBy fate, what was written came to pass.\n\n1 This is Sultan Muhammad, son of Dary\u0101 L\u016bh\u0101n\u012b. Stewart's Bengal 131. Kh\u0101t Kh\u0101n calls him Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n L\u016bh\u0101n\u012b, Bib. Ind. ed. I, 89. In Dorn's History and in Stewart he is called Pir Kh\u0101n.\n\n2 In Monghyr and at the east end of that district. But apparently this is a slip of the author for Teliagarhi in the Southal Parganas. See Jarrett II, 116 and note.\n\n3 Text, nas\u012bb but this is wrong. See Jarrett II, 147n. and Riy\u0101zu-s-sal\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn, Bib. Ind. text 139.\n\n4 The text has G\u014drakhp\u016br, but a note says that many MSS. have Gaur. The context and history show that Gaur is right. See Stewart's Bengal, 120. Gaur capitulated in 1537 to Sh\u0113r Sh\u0101h's son.\n\n5 See Erskine's note on this prediction II, 135n. Apparently the pre-\nVerse.\n\nI heard from a sage that wisdom is plentiful,\nBut that it is scattered about among mankind.\n\nDuring the time that the royal standards were engaged in conquering M\u0101lw\u0101 and Gujrat, Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n seized his opportunity and made great progress. The above is a sketch of the beginning of his career. The remainder of his story, the last of his actions, and his wretched end will be narrated in a parenthesis of the account of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, so that the authors of strife and contention may take warning therefrom.\u00b9\n\nIn fine, as the idea of an expedition to the eastern provinces had become fixed in the mind of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, Mir Faqr \u2018Ali, who had been one of the great officers of his Majesty Firdausmak\u0101n\u012b Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b was appointed to the charge of Dihli while Agra was entrusted to Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhsh\u012b, who was one of the trusted servants of the State. Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101, his Majesty\u2019s cousin, was sent to K\u0101lp\u012b which was his j\u0101g\u012br in order to manage that quarter. N\u016bru-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad Mirz\u0101\u00b2 who was married to his Majesty\u2019s sister Gulrang B\u0113gam and was the progenitor of Salima Sult\u0101n B\u0113gam, was appointed to the charge of Qanauj. His Majesty having in this manner arranged the officers of his kingdom went off to the eastward by boat, along with his chaste and veiled\n\n\u00b9 A.F.\u2019s moralising is rather misplaced. Was Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n\u2019s death when engaged in a holy war and in the hour of victory, as pitiable as the slip on a stair which ended Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s days?\n\n\u00b2 The Ma\u1e6d\u0101\u1e63ir-i-rak\u012bm\u012b (MS.A.S.B. 194a) says that N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn was the son of Mirz\u0101 \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-daula who was related to Khw\u0101ja \u1e24asan \u2018Att\u0101r who again was son of Khw\u0101ja \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-\n\nd\u012bn who was the first Khalifa of the Naqshband\u012b order. The Gulrang B\u0113gam whom N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn married was Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s half-sister, being a daughter of Dild\u0101r B\u0113gam and full-sister of Hind\u0101l and Gulbadan B\u0113gam. Her daughter Sal\u012bma was first married to Bair\u0101m and afterwards to Akbar. Bair\u0101m received Sal\u012bma in marriage as a reward for his helping Hum\u0101y\u016bn to conquer India, and also perhaps because they were related. Sal\u012bma\u2019s great-grandmother, P\u0101sh\u0101 B\u0113gam being a daughter of Bair\u0101m\u2019s ancestor \u2018Al\u012b Shukr who belonged to the Turko-m\u0101ns of the Black Sheep.\nconsorts. Mirz\u0101 \u2018Askar\u012b and Mirz\u0101 Hind\u0101l accompanied him, who among the officers were Ibr\u0101h\u012bm B\u0113g C\u0101b\u016bq, Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b B\u0113g, Khusrau B\u0113g K\u014dkalt\u0101sh, Tardi B\u0113g Kh\u0101n, Q\u016bc B\u0113g, Tardi B\u0113g Et\u0101w\u0101, Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, Q\u0101sim Husain Kh\u0101n Uzbak, B\u016bcak\u0101 B\u0113g, Z\u0101l\u012b B\u0113g, D\u014dst B\u0113g, B\u0113g M\u012brak, H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad (son of) B\u0101b\u0101 Qu\u1e63\u1e25a Y\u0101q\u016bb B\u0113g, Nih\u0101l B\u0113g, R\u014dshan B\u0113g, Mughul B\u0113g and a large number of other distinguished men. The army proceeded by land and by water whilst his Majesty, sometimes sitting in a boat and sometimes riding on horse-back, deliberated on the affairs of state and proceeded towards the fort of Cun\u0101r where was Sh\u014dr Kh\u0101n. When the army drew nigh to Cun\u0101r, M. Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n came from Gujr\u0101t with the dust of confusion on his forehead and the drops of shame on his cheek, and had the happiness to be permitted to kiss the lofty threshold. The brief account of this occurrence is as follows. His Majesty\u2019s dear sister Ma\u1e63\u016bma Sult\u0101n B\u0113gam, the Mirz\u0101\u2019s wife, had in Agra petitioned about the Mirz\u0101\u2019s guilt and had received an order of reconciliation. His Majesty from his innate goodness, drew the line of forgiveness over his offences and directed that he should be sent for. When the Mirz\u0101 arrived near the grand army, a number of high officers were sent to meet him, and when he was a day\u2019s journey off, M. \u2018Askar\u012b and M. Hind\u0101l went out in accordance with the lofty commands and embraced him. M. \u2018Askar\u012b saluting him by raising his hand up to his breast, while M. Hind\u0101l saluted by putting his hand on his head. They brought the Mirz\u0101 with respect to the camp and that day the Mirz\u0101, in accordance with the king\u2019s command, was conveyed to his own tent. Next day he was brought to the lofty pavilion and having done homage, was treated with royal favours. Twice was he exalted in one assemblage by a special khil\u2019at, a belt, a sword and a horse. Bravo! At the\n\n1 Blochmann 332, who writes J\u0101b\u016bq. Probably c\u0101bul \u2018celer,\u2019 is the correct reading. Perhaps he is the Ibr\u0101h\u012bm B\u0113gcik of the Tar. Rash\u012bd, Elias and Ross, 470, and described there as father of Jah\u0101ng\u012br Qul\u012b.\n\n2 Blochmann 455, B\u0101bar 95 and 368.\n\n3 Qu\u1e63\u1e25a is a Turkish word meaning the star on a horse\u2019s forehead. B\u0101ba Qu\u1e63\u1e25a was a servant of B\u0101bar, 364.\n\n4 Half-sister of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, being the daughter of Ma\u1e63\u016bma, the daughter of Sultan Ahmad and who married her cousin B\u0101bar. B\u0101bar 208.\n\n5 See Blochmann 158 for A.F.\u2019s account of the taslim. \u2018Askar\u012b being the elder brother did not salute so humbly as Hind\u0101l.\ngate of God's elect, sins are requited (lit. bought) by benefits, and wickednesses are reckoned as virtues. There is such plenty in the store-house of divine grace that His peculiar mercies are co-ordinate with offenders; in proportion as they increase their crimes and sins do they obtain increase of grace and forgiveness. This attribute is the more appropriate to princes in that they are the shadows of God, so that by passing over offences no harm is done to the breadth of their mercy and the amplitude of their power; and the wretch who is ashamed of his evil deeds, obtains an order of release from the pit of torture. In short his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat \u0100shy\u0101n\u012b, in spite of rebellion so great that (even) to pardon it were improper, became an expounder of the Divine ethics and returned good for evil. God be praised! His Majesty, the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h of the Age, (Akbar) hath these noble qualities and weighty ethics; they are part of his nature and of the essence of his holy soul, and in the meting out of punishment he practises a consideration and hesitation such as no other king has been adorned with from the cycle of Adam until now. In this book a few instances will be given out of many. May God Almighty increase daily this family and may He, in reward of this generous nature bestow plenteous blessings on his Majesty's life and dominion!\n\nIn short when Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n was apprized of the uprearing of the victorious standards, he left his son Qutb Kh\u0101n and many others in Cun\u0101r, and after strengthening the fort, departed to Bengal. He conquered that country in war and obtained much booty. When the world-conquering army of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shi-y\u0101n\u012b encamped near Cun\u0101r, he applied himself to the taking of the fortress. R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n who was the paragon of the age for overcoming grand forts and sky-high castles, and who had left Sult\u0101n Bah\u0101dur after the victory of Mandas\u014dr, and been enrolled as one of his Majesty's servants, and exalted by the office of Mir \u0100tag\u0101l (Director of Ordnance) constructed a covered way (s\u0101b\u0101t) upon boats and arranged such a roof (s\u0101tha) with strong partitions (?) on the top of a platform of planks that the ingenious and skilful bit the finger of astonishment in admiration of the workmanship.1 And\n\n1 See Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn's account, Elliot V, 200. It is more detailed and more intelligible than A.F.'s. Apparently R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n built a wooden tower so lofty that when placed on boats and conveyed across the river\nhe carried such mines under the walls that when they were fired Time and the Terrene (zamin u zam\u0101n) were shaken. Qutb Kh\u0101n fled, and the remainder of the garrison asked for quarter and came out. The fort fell into the possession of the king's servants. For those admitted to quarter, they were about 2,000 in number though his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had ratified R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n's promise and had pardoned (?) them, yet Mu'ayyid B\u0113g D\u016bldai, who was one of the confidential officers, added to the order that their hands should be cut off, and represented that this was the king's command; such was the usurpation of authority that he displayed! His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b censured him for this. R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n received royal favours, and his influence and renown were increased. In return for his services the fort was made over to him, but in a few days he became by destiny an object of envy to the world and passed away, poisoned.\n\nWhen his mind was free of this affair, the expedition to Bengal presented itself before him. Na\u1e63\u012bb Sh\u0101h, the ruler of Bengal, came to the foot of the hill, it enabled the assailants to get to the wall under cover. See also Janhar, Stewart 10, and Tiefenthaler's plate I, 450, No. XXIX which shows a wall coming down to the water's edge.\n\n1 Dorn's History of the Afghans, p. 112, calls him the son of Sultan Mahmad, and the Chronicle of Gh\u012br Sh\u0101h says the same thing but adds the epithet D\u016bldai. Garcin de Tassy, p. 84. D\u016bldai is a division of the Barlas tribe. Blochmann 388. Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn says that only the artillerymen had their hands cut off, and that this was done by Hum\u0101y\u016bn's orders. It is impossible that 2,000 men could have their hands cut off without Hum\u0101y\u016bn's becoming acquainted with the fact while the brutality was going on. Janhar, (Stewart 10), who is perhaps the most to be trusted, as he was with Hum\u0101y\u016bn at the time, says that R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n caused the hands of the artillerymen to be cut off, and that Hum\u0101y\u016bn was very angry with him on this account. The same authority says that R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n's floating battery, &c., did little execution. Bay\u0101z\u012bd 218. tells us that Mu'ayyid died in Kabul shortly after the first taking of it, to the universal joy of the army, who regarded him as a Satan and as the cause of the loss of India, &c.\n\nI am not sure of the meaning but think that ta\u1e25akkum is used in the sense of fancied or self-assumed authority. B. M. MS. has a ki at the end of the words which perhaps is an improvement, the meaning then being that M. B\u0113g so far usurped authority that Hum\u0101y\u016bn had to rebuke him.\n\nNa\u1e63\u012bb is apparently intended for Nuruzat, but both names appear to be wrong. Nuruzat died in 943\nwounded to the world-protecting Court, and implored help against Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n. This was an additional reason for conquering Bengal, and another call to him to proceed there. His Majesty comforted him by his princely sympathy, and distinguished him by royal favours. As the expedition had now been determined upon, Jaunp\u016br and its territory was made over to M\u012br Hind\u016b B\u0113g who was one of the great officers, while Cun\u0101r was given to M\u012brak B\u0113g. Preparations having been made, the army proceeded by land and water. When Patna became the camping ground, the loyal servants of the Court represented that the rainy season had arrived, and that if his Majesty delayed the Bengal expedition until this season had passed over, this would be consonant with the rules of conquest, since the passage of cavalry into Bengal at this season was very difficult, and would be productive of destruction to the soldiers. The ruler of Bengal looked to his own interests and represented that Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n had not yet confirmed himself in Bengal, and that to march speedily against him would be a means of extirpating him with ease. His Majesty out of consideration for this oppressed one, and from the plausibility of his statements, gave orders for the advance. In Bh\u0101galp\u016br he divided the army, sending M. Hind\u0101l across the river with 5000 or 6000 men to march along its banks on that side. When the army had encamped at Monghyr, news came that Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n, the son of Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n, who after his father\u2019s death took the name of Salim Kh\u0101n,1 with Khaw\u0101s Kh\u0101n, Barmazid,2 Sarmast Kh\u0101n,3 Haibat Kh\u0101n Niy\u0101zi,4 and Bah\u0101r Kh\u0101n5 with about 15,000 men had come to Ga\u1e6dh\u012b which is, as it were, the gate of Bengal, and that having strengthened it they were meditating strife and sedition.\n\nA.H., or earlier, and the King of Bengal who fled, wounded, to Hu-m\u0101y\u016bn, was Mahm\u016bd or Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mahm\u016bd Sh\u0101h, another of the 18 sons of the famous \u1e24usain Sh\u0101h. No Na\u1e63\u012bb appears in the list of kings of Bengal, but probably there was such a name for there is a quarter of the town of Murghid\u0101-b\u0101d called Na\u1e63\u012bbp\u016br.\n\n---\n\n1 Elsewhere A. F. calls him Isl\u0101m Kh\u0101n.\n2 Barmazid Goor, Dorn, 128.\n3 An Afgh\u0101n tribe, Jarrett II. 403.\n4 This according to Dorn, 93, was a title given by Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n to \u1e24ab\u012bb Kh\u0101n Kakar.\n5 Or Pah\u0101r.\nThe account of this affair is as follows: When Sh\u00e9r Kh\u00e1n heard of the approach of the imperial army he could not bring himself to fight but went off by way of Jh\u00e1rkhand, so that when the grand army came into Bengal, he might go to Bih\u00e1r and stir up commotion in that province, and also that he might place the spot of Bengal in safety. He left Jal\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n and a large body of men at Garhi and arranged that when the conquering army approached he himself had got to Sh\u00e9rp\u00far, they should make haste to join him and should avoid fighting. His Majesty deputed from Bh\u00e1g\u00ed, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm B\u00e9g C\u00e1b\u016bq, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Quli B\u00e9g, Bair\u00e1m B\u00e9g, Nah\u00e1l R\u00f3sh\u00e1n B\u00e9g, Gurg \u2018\u00c1li B\u00e9g, Bacaka Bah\u00e1d\u00far, and a large force consisting of about 5000 or 6000 men. When the imperial army arrived in the neighbourhood of Garhi, Jal\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n departed from his father\u2019s instructions, got together his army and attacked the camp. The men of it had not put themselves in order for fighting so as to combat properly. They were not properly drawn up, and the enemy was numerous. Nor were the former ready for battle. Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n turned several times and attacked the enemy, and dispersed them. He made gallant efforts but from want of management he was not properly supported, and things did not go satisfactorily. \u2018\u00c1li Kh\u00e1n Mah\u00e1w\u00e1n\u00ed, H\u00e1id\u00e1r Bakhsh\u00ed and several other officers attained the glory of martyrdom. When this news came to the hearing of his Majesty, he rapidly proceeded to the spot. On the way the sea-adorning boat which was his special barge, was sunk at Colgong. When the royal army came near the black-fated Afgh\u00e1ns, the wretches fled.

By a hundred flatteries and deceptions the simple-minded R\u0101j\u0101 was persuaded by the tricks of that juggler.

He left Jal\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n and a large body of men near Garhi and arranged that when the conquering army approached and he himself had got to Sh\u00e9rp\u00far, they should make haste to join him, and should avoid fighting. His Majesty deputed from Bh\u00e1galp\u00far Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm B\u00e9g C\u00e1b\u00faq, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Quli B\u00e9g, Bair\u00e1m B\u00e9g, Nah\u00e1l B\u00e9g, R\u00f3shan B\u00e9g, Gurg \u2018\u00c1li B\u00e9g, Bacaka Bah\u00e1dur, and a large force consisting of about 5000 or 6000 men. When the imperial army arrived in the neighbourhood of Garhi, Jal\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n departed from his father\u2019s instructions, got together his army and attacked the camp. The men of it had not put themselves in order for fighting so as to combat properly. They were not properly drawn up, and the enemy was numerous. Nor were the former ready for battle. Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n turned several times and attacked the enemy, and dispersed them. He made gallant efforts but from want of management he was not properly supported, and things did not go satisfactorily. \u2018\u00c1li Kh\u00e1n Mah\u00e1w\u00e1n\u00ed, Haidar Bakhsh\u00ed and several other officers attained the glory of martyrdom. When this news came to the hearing of his Majesty, he rapidly proceeded to the spot. On the way the sea-adorning boat which was his special barge, was sunk at Colgong. When the royal army came near the black-fated Afgh\u00e1ns, the wretches fled.

After some days he arrived at the capital and arranged his seditious plans. In the inner-chamber of his brain, which was void of the divine halo, he concocted the desire of sovereignty. Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n, seeing the propitiousness of the time, extended his strife and sedition. He came and besieged Benares; he soon took it and put to death Mir Fa\u1e63li the governor. From there he went to Jaunp\u016br which was held by B\u0101b\u0101 B\u0113g Jal\u0101ir, the father of Sh\u0101ham Kh\u0101n, he having been appointed after the death of Hind\u016b B\u0113g. B\u0101b\u0101 B\u0113g brought Jaunp\u016br under discipline and sedulously strengthened it. Y\u016bsuf B\u0113g, son of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm B\u0113g C\u0101b\u016bq, was marching from Oudh to Bengal. He joined B\u0101b\u0101 B\u0113g, but was always scouring the country with an advanced guard and was ever in quest of an engagement. Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n got news of this, and made a rapid march with 2,000 or 3,000 men. Y\u016bsuf B\u0113g saw the dust of the army and was eager to fight. Though his comrades pointed out to him the largeness of the enemy and the smallness of his own force, it was of no avail, and he bravely drank the last draught in the neighbourhood of Jaunp\u016br. Next day the enemy invested Jaunp\u016br. B\u0101b\u0101 Kh\u0101n Jal\u0101ir gave proof of courage and skill in defending it, and sent off reports to the Mirz\u0101s and officers. He also made repeated representations to the Court (at Gaur). Mir Faqr \u2018Ali came from Dihli to Agra, and proffered sound advice to M. Hind\u0101l. After much discussion he brought away the Mirz\u0101 from Agra to the other side of the river. He also appointed Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhsh\u012b to give what help the time allowed of, in dispatching Mirz\u0101 Hind\u0101l quickly to Jaunp\u016br. Mir Faqr \u2018Ali then went off from there to K\u0101lp\u012b to get Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 equipped for the army, and to arrange for a meeting of the Mirz\u0101s in the territory of Karra,\u00b9 and for a march onwards from there. At this time Khusrau B\u0113g K\u014dkalt\u0101sh, H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad (son of) B\u0101b\u0101 Qushqa, Z\u0101hid B\u0113g, Mirz\u0101 Nazar and many others, out of crookedness and strife-mongering absconded from Bengal and came to M. N\u016bru-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad who had been left in Kanauj. The Mirz\u0101 reported their arrival to M. Hind\u0101l, and requested that they should be personally\n\n\u00b9 Agra in text, but Lucknow ed. and Price have Karra (4 miles W.N.W. All\u0101h\u0101b\u0101d) and this is clearly right. Tiefenthaler I, 235 has a plan of Karra.\nreceived. M. Hind\u0101l sent friendly letters to them by Mu\u1e25ammad Gh\u0101z\u012b T\u016bghb\u0101i, who was one of the Mirz\u0101's confidants. He also wrote explanations of their arrival to Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 and Mir Faqr 'Al\u012b. The officers who were with M. N\u016bru-d-din Mu\u1e25ammad, did not wait for an answer but came on to K\u016bl ('Aligarh) which was in Z\u0101hid B\u0113g's flef. Hind\u0101l's messenger heard of this on his way and hastened to join them. These short-sighted disloyalists opened their raving mouths and plainly said, \"Henceforth we do not serve the king; if you, as you have already purposed, will have the khutba read in your own name, we will enter into your service and render you faithful allegiance; otherwise we shall go to Mirz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n where happiness and a welcome are waiting for us (lit. are in our bosom).\" Mu\u1e25ammad Gh\u0101z\u012b T\u016bghb\u0101i returned and secretly delivered the officers' message and said, that one of two things was inevitable. Either Hind\u0101l must have the khutba read in his own name and send for and caress the officers, or they must be laid hold of by stratagem and be confined. M. Hind\u0101l, whose head was always itching after folly, looked upon this opinion as a valuable find, and with promises of kind treatment sent for those irreflecting traitors and spoke soothingly to them, and confirmed them in their evil imaginings.\n\nWhen the alienation of Benares and Jaunp\u016br was reported to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and the deceitful designs of M. Hind\u0101l became known to him, he despatched Shaikh Buhl\u016bl who was one of the great Shaikhs of India and the recipient of royal favours, from Bengal that he might proceed quickly to the capital, and by sage advice restrain the Mirz\u0101 from evil thoughts and induce him to act with one accord in extirpating the Afgh\u0101ns. The Shaikh arrived post-haste, just when the officers were propounding their wicked schemes and were near drawing M. Hind\u0101l away from the straight path. M. Hind\u0101l went out to welcome him and brought him with honour and respect to his own house. The Shaikh's weighty words strengthened M. Hind\u0101l in the intention of serving with which he had gone forth. Next day Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhsh\u012b was brought in order that all the preparations for the army\u2014gold, camels, horses, accoutrements\u2014might be made. Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhsh\u012b represented that there was no money for the soldiers, but that there\n\n---\n\n1 Or T\u016bqb\u0101l. It is the name of an Afgh\u0101n tribe. Jarrett II, 403.\nwas abundance of materials and stores, and that he would carry out everything as was desired. Four or five days had not passed since this conversation when M. N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn came in haste from Qanauj. And apparently all that the officers had plotted together was strengthened by his coming. Mu\u1e25ammad Gh\u0101z\u012b T\u016bghb\u0101\u012b was sent a second time to the officers and they reiterated what they had said before, and made this condition, that, as an indication that their proposals had been accepted, Shaikh Buhl\u016bl, who was the king\u2019s envoy and was confounding their schemes, should be publicly put to death, so that everyone might be assured that M. Hind\u0101l had separated himself from the king, and that they (the officers) might serve him with minds at ease. The Shaikh was engaged in arranging for the march of the army, and was looking after the ordering of the accoutrements, when the messenger returned. In accord with M. N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad the unbecoming proposal was ratified, and M. N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad seized the Shaikh, by M. Hind\u0101l\u2019s orders, in his house and taking him across the river, ordered him to be beheaded in a sandy spot near the Royal Garden. The abandoned officers came and did homage to the M\u012brz\u0101, and in an inauspicious hour and in a time of confusion the khutba was read in M. Hind\u0101l\u2019s name. The troops then marched on. Though the chaste Dild\u0101r \u0100gh\u0101ca B\u0113gam, M. Hind\u0101l\u2019s venerable mother, and the other B\u0113gams counselled him, it was absolutely of no avail. The tongue of his actions uttered this verse.\n\n\u201cAdvice of man is wind in mine ear,\nBut \u2019tis a wind that fans my fire.\u201d\n\n1 i.e., T\u016bghb\u0101\u012b. He had gone to \u2018Al\u012bgarh where the officers still were, being afraid to come on until Hind\u0101l had proved his adhesion to their schemes.\n\n2 Bad\u0101oni describes this occurrence and gives the chronogram \u201cAssuredly he died a martyr,\u201d faq\u0101d m\u0101la shah\u012bdan=945 (1538). Shaikh Buhl\u016bl or P\u012bl was one of the great saints of India and elder brother of Mu\u1e25ammad Ghaus of Gw\u0101ly\u0101r. Bad\u0101oni I. 4. M. Haidar speaks disparagingly of him as merely a sorcerer, (p. 398,) but apparently never saw him, and was prejudiced against him because Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s attachment to Buhl\u016bl had made him neglect Khw\u0101ja N\u016bra, Haidar\u2019s patron saint.\n\n3 Presumably towards Dihl\u012b.\nWhen M. Hind\u0101l had the kh\u016b\u1e6dba read in his name and came before his mother, that cupola of chastity had a blue cloth over her breast. The Mirz\u0101 said, \"What kind of dress is that you have donned at such a time of rejoicing?\" That cupola of chastity replied, out of her foresight, \"Why do you regard me? I am wearing mourning for you; you are young (he was only 19) and have, from the instigation of irreflecting sedition-mongers, lost the true way; you have girded your loins for your own destruction.\" Muhammad Bakhsh\u012b came and said, \"You have killed the Shaikh; why do you delay about me?\" The Mirz\u0101 treated him kindly and took him with him. When Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 and Mir Faqr \u2018Al\u012b heard of this bad business they made a rapid march from K\u0101lp\u012b via Gw\u0101ly\u0101r, and coming to Dihl\u012b took measures to strengthen the city and to provide for the fort. The Mirz\u0101 had reached Ham\u012bdp\u016br, near Fir\u014dz\u0101b\u0101d when the news came that Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 and Mir Faqr \u2018Al\u012b had arrived at Dihl\u012b. The Mirz\u0101 and the officers consulted together and proceeded to invest Dihl\u012b. Many of the petty j\u0101gird\u0101rs round about came and did homage to the Mirz\u0101, and he made march after march and besieged Dihl\u012b. Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 and Mir Faqr \u2018Al\u012b exerted themselves in holding the fort, and sent an account of affairs to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and begged him to come and quell the sedition. He set out from L\u0101hor and when he came near S\u016bnpat, M. Hind\u0101l hurried off to the province of Agra without having accomplished his purpose. When M. K\u0101mr\u0101n approached Dihl\u012b Mir Faqr \u2018Al\u012b came and had an interview with him, while Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 continued to hold the fort as before. Mir Faqr \u2018Al\u012b induced M. K\u0101mr\u0101n to proceed to Agra, and M. Hind\u0101l not having the resolution to remain there went off to Alwar. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, after he came to Agra, desired that cupola of chastity, Dild\u0101r \u0100gh\u0101ca B\u0113gam to soothe M. Hind\u0101l and to\n\n---\n\n1 kab\u016bd the sign of mourning.\n2 Also called Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad, (A.N., I. 259,) and perhaps the Bakhsh\u012b called Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad of Badaksh\u0101n.

N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 and Faqr \u2018Al\u012b went by the West of Dihl\u012b and Hind\u0101l by the East, but he must have been very remiss to let them get from K\u0101lp\u012b to Dihl\u012b before him.\n4 I.G. 28 miles N. N. W. Dihl\u012b. Jarrett II, 287, where it is spelt S\u016bnpat.\nrecall him to obedience. That matron (kadban\u0101), the pavilion of chastity, brought M. Hindal from Alwar and introduced him to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n with his shroud (f\u016b\u1e6da) round his neck. The Mirz\u0101 (K\u0101mr\u0101n) behaved with propriety, and next day he forgave the seditious officers and held a levee for them. The Mirz\u0101s and officers joined together and crossed the Jumna in order to put down the rebellion of Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n. But as auspiciousness did not guide those highborn ones they did not obtain the blessing of such a glorious service.\n\nIn fact when by celestial aid the country of Bengal had come into possession of the imperial servants, and its capital had become the headquarters of the army, and the great officers had obtained large territories in fief, they gathered the materials of enjoyment and pleasure and opened the gates of negligence in the front of their lives. The pillars of sovereignty paid less attention to administration, and strife-mongers, of which wretches this wide world is never free, raised the head of discord and sedition. The time was at hand when slumbering strife should lift up her downcast eyelashes. Fissures found their way into the foundation of circumspection.\n\nInformation such as could be depended upon did not come to headquarters, or if one thing out of many became known to any of the confidants, he had not the courage to communicate it, for the arrangement then was that no particle of unpleasantness should be bruited in the august assemblage. When by degrees the truth about the rebellion in Hindustan was conveyed by real well-wishers, who, in disregard of their own advantage, represented the true facts, his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b called together the pillars of the state and determined on the return of the Grand Army. Though from excessive rain the country was under water, and the rivers were tempestuous, and it was not the season for campaigning, yet on account of the emergency it was considered that a return was necessary for the preservation of the empire. The charge of Bengal was ordered to be entrusted to Z\u0101hid B\u0113g, but that worthless one took up the presumptuous ways of an old servant, and having given\n\n1 He was married to a sister of Humayun's favourite wife B\u0113gha B\u0113gam otherwise H\u0101j\u012b B\u0113gam and presumed thereupon.

His Majesty made over Bengal to Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli B\u0113g and left a large force to support him. He then in the height\\(^1\\) of the rains turned his bridle and set out for the capital (Agra).\n\nWhen Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n heard of the returning of the royal army, and of the departure of the M\u012brz\u0101s from Agra he withdrew from Jaunp\u016br and proceeded towards Roht\u0101s. His plan was that if the sublime standards should come against him, he should avoid a battle and return by the Jh\u0101rkhand route, by which he had come, and aim at Bengal, (qr. Gaur the capital). And if this should not happen (that Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s army should follow him) and if the imperial army should proceed towards Agra and an opportunity offered itself, he would follow in its wake and attempt a night attack. When the sublime army of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b arrived at T\u012brhut,\\(^2\\) Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n came to know the smallness of the force and the disorganization of the royal camp, and waxed audacious (\\(sh\u012brak\\))\\(^3\\) and advanced with a large and fully equipped army.\n\nHe got under his control all the country round about the army, and no one was able to procure information about the enemy\u2019s manoeuvres. Ibn \u2018Al\u012b Qar\u0101walb\u0113g\u012b (chief scout) went and brought authentic news which were communicated to his Majesty through\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is not very intelligible. The rains of 946, (1539,) cannot be meant, for the battle of Causa did not take place till 27th June, 1539, and after Hum\u0101y\u016bn had been encamped in the neighbourhood for 2 or 3 months. I suppose Hum\u0101y\u016bn must have left Gaur in the end of the rains of 1538, i.e., in September or October, and before the country was sufficiently dried up. But if so, he must have marched very slowly indeed not to get to Causa till March or April. The Hind\u016bst\u0101n\u012b chronicler of Sh\u0113r Sh\u0101h, Garcin de Tassy, says Hum\u0101y\u016bn left Bengal when the sun was entering the sign of the Bull (i.e., in April). The same phrase \u2018ain-i-b\u0101r\u0101n,\n\nheight of the rains, has been already used at p. 151, with reference to Hind\u0101l\u2019s departure, though that must have taken place a considerable time before Hum\u0101y\u016bn left Gaur.\n\n\\(^2\\) There is the variant Narhan, but neither form seems correct, both being too far east. Price has Purtuh which he conceives may be Patna, and a pencil note to Chalmer\u2019s suggests P\u016brn\u012by\u0101. This last seems most likely. Hum\u0101y\u016bn does not seem to have advanced on the N. bank of the Ganges beyond over against Monghir.\n\n\\(^3\\) A pun, \\(sh\u012brak\\) meaning a little \\(sh\u0113r\\) tiger.\nM. Mu\u1e25ammad Zam\u0101n. Though the grand army had crossed the Ganges, and was marching to the capital, yet when news was brought of Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n\u2019s arrival and of his being close by, the flames of the royal wrath were kindled, and out of his perfect majesty and dominion he turned his reins towards him. Though it was represented to him that at such a time, when the army was in the highest degree without equipment\u2014it having travelled such a distance through mud\u2014it was improper to march against the foe and to hasten to the field of battle and that what was proper was to halt somewhere and recruit the army and then to undertake the crushing of the enemy,\u2014such views were not acceptable to his Majesty and so he crossed the Ganges and marched against the foe.\n\nIt behoves us to know that it is an ancient canon and fixed principle that, when the stewards of the kingdom of Divine destiny assign to an individual an article of price, they open beforehand the gates of failure and cast him into a tumult of anguish, so that felicity may not remove the unique pearl from its place, and that by this experience sorrow may be fulfilled and things brought to an equilibrium. Accordingly,\u2014as the apparition of the light-increasing star of mortals, which by showing itself in dreamland from out of Q\u0101c\u016bli Bah\u0101dur\u2019s bosom had exalted the vigilant by the blessing of expectation, was drawing nigh,\u2014the countenances of the thoughts of the meditative and farseeing are not scarred if before this there appeared some misfortunes. Thus did such things happen at the hands of sundry black-hearted, unwashed Afgh\u0101ns, to a force which might have conquered the universe. Thus was it that, contrary to the advice of ministers, the army marched against the Afgh\u0101ns, and came face to face with Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n at the village of Bih\u012bya\u00b9 which is a dependency of Bh\u014djp\u016br.\u00b2 There a black\u00b3 river called the Karman\u0101s\u0101 (Text, Kanb\u0101s) flowed between the two armies. The royal army made a bridge over it and crossed. Though the royal army was small and many were without equipments, it was victorious in every skirmish, and the Afgh\u0101ns were slaughtered on every side. But the period of encountering and slaying was pro-\n\n\u00b9Fat\u1e25pur Bih\u012ba.

The blessedness of learning what service was at such a crisis did not help their destiny. Though admonitory rescripts were sent to them, the impressions on these inspired tablets took no form in the minds of those iron-hearts. Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n, out of craft, sometimes sent influential persons to the sublime porte to knock at the door of peace, and sometimes cherished wicked thoughts of war. At length he deceitfully and fraudulently left a body of infantry and inefficient men, together with his artillery, in face while he himself marched two stages to the rear and then encamped. The royal army, which had all along been victorious, did not understand the craft of that trickster, so they followed and encamped. When an event is going to happen in accordance with destiny, carelessness on the part of the sagacious comes in to help. In this way great remissness ensued in keeping watch. At length Muhammad Zam\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 showed utter negligence on a night when it was his watch. That fox (Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n) who was waiting for an opportunity, made a night march and in the morning presented himself at the rear of the camp. His army was divided into three bands (t\u016bp), one led by himself, one by Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n, and one by Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 Kh\u0101n. The royal troops had not time to buckle their saddles or to close their cuirasses. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b when he became apprized of the army\u2019s negligence, was confounded by this specimen of fate\u2019s workshop, and the thread of resource dropped from his hand. As he was mounting, B\u0101b\u0101 Jal\u0101ir and Q\u016bc B\u0113g1 arrived, and he bade them go quickly and bring away the noble lady H\u0101j\u012b B\u0113gam.2 Those two faithful and zealous servants drank the wholesome sherbet of martyrdom at the door of honour\u2019s enclosure. Mir Pahlw\u0101n Badaksh\u012b also and many others obtained the blessing of offering up their lives around the enclosure of chastity. The time was very brief; her Highness could not come out, but as the Divine protection and defence was her surety and safe-\n\n---\n\n1 See Errata, but according to some MSS.

By fate he got separated\nfrom his horse. Just then, as Providence was watching over his\nMajesty, a water-carrier became the Elijah of his course, and by\nthe help of his (the water-carrier\u2019s) swimming, he emerged from that\nwhirlpool to the shore of safety. On the way his Majesty asked him\nhis name. He answered, \u201cN\u012bz\u0101m.\u201d His Majesty replied, \u201cA very\nN\u012bz\u0101m Auliya.\u201d He showed him kindness and favour and promised\nthat when he safely sate upon the throne, he would give him royalty for\nhalf a day. This anguish-fraught affair (qiss\u0101-i-pur-ghus\u1e63a) occurred\non 9th Safar, 946, (7th June, 1539), on the bank of the Ganges at the\nCausa ferry. M.

His Majesty from his innate clemency forgave his offences and made many inquiries about his welfare. When from causes beyond control a destined event suddenly made its appearance, he at once sought to remedy it. He engaged himself in collecting arms and in retrieving the position. Officers and soldiers came from the provinces and had the honour of performing their obeisances. At this time the honest water-carrier presented himself at the foot of the throne in reliance on the great promise. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, who was the crown-giver and throne-conferrer of the land of generosity and urbanity, when he saw the friendless water-carrier afar off, immediately gave his Cyrus (khusrav)-covenant a place on the throne of fulfilment, and having vacated the seat of sovereignty in favour of the Elijah of the path, he set the water-carrier, in accordance with his promise, upon the throne for half a day, thereby equalling him to the monarch of midday. Having excepted sundry kingly powers and functions which his capacity could not have comprehended, he exalted him by conferring on him the dignity of command, and wiped away, with the swelling sea of munificence, the dust of want from the countenance of his condition and of that of his tribe. Every order which during that incumbency on the kingly throne, issued from the water-carrier, was executed forthwith. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n on beholding such loftiness of soul displayed the wrinkle of cavil on the forehead of criticism, and a pretext (for displeasure) was furnished to his trouble-seeking heart.\n\nAfter this affair of deceit (that of Causa) Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n made an attack on Bengal. He came to the extremity of Bih\u0101r, and then halted there and sent Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n with a force of troubleurs against Bengal. In a short time there was a battle with Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli Kh\u0101n who bravely maintained the contest. Inasmuch however, as the design of Providence was otherwise, the Bengal officers did not act harmoniously in putting down the rebellion, but sought their own comfort and did not combine in this war. After struggles and trials Jah\u0101ng\u012br Quli was unable to keep the field, and had to retreat and take refuge with the landholders (zamind\u0101r\u016bn). He came forth thence on a false\n\n1 The Persians call the sun P\u0101dsh\u0101h-i-N\u012bmr\u016bz, and A.

Sh\u00e9r Kh\u00e1n being at ease about Bengal went towards Jaunp\u00fcr. This he subdued and made long the arm of strife. He sent his younger son, Qutb Kh\u00e1n, with a large body of vagabonds against K\u00e1lpi and Et\u0101wa. When news of this reached the august ears, Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir, M. Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Kh\u00e1n Uzbak, who held these parts in fief, and Iskandar Sult\u0101n, who had charge for M. K\u0101mr\u0101n of some estates in K\u00e1lpi, were sent against Qutb Kh\u00e1n. These lions of bravery\u2019s field encountered the foxy tricksters and fought a great battle. By the Divine aid, they gained the victory and Qutb Kh\u00e1n was slain.\n\nHis Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b stayed for a while in Agra, the capital, arranging his troops, and conciliating his brothers and relatives and amending their secret dispositions. Though he washed the dust-stained cheek of K\u0101mr\u0101n with the limpid waters of counsel, he could in no wise cleanse it, and however much he scoured the rust of contrariety with the burnisher of advice, the brightness of concord could by no means be developed in the mirror of his fortune. And in such a crisis, when, even if there were internal dissension, outward concord was necessary to safeguard his own fortunes, and at such a time, when together with other resources he had 20,000 tried soldiers with him, and when by the abounding and beneficent favours and prestige of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, territory from K\u0101bul to D\u0101war Zamin in the north, and to Sam\u0101na in the south was in his possession, he, being contentious and wanting in his duty to so eminent a king, elder brother and benefactor, alleged illness and with abundance of carelessness and absence of circumspection, held himself aloof from such important service. Almighty God returned to him in this workshop of recompenses (this world), the fruit of his deeds and in the forefront of life he beheld by his own eyes the punishment of his actions. Some of these results will be briefly described with the pen of manifestation in their proper place.\n\n1 Probably the son of Sa\u02bf\u012bd Kh\u00e1n referred to in the T\u0101r.

First he sent Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n B\u0113g with a large force to Lahor, and then turning away from the qibla of fortune, himself followed him. He became an author and architect of destruction and detriment, drawing evil on friends and attracting good to foes. Though his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b said, \"Prince, if you may not give the blessing of companionship and must throw away such an opportunity, make your men join me,\" the M\u012brz\u0101 in direct opposition to his Majesty's desire perverted even the king's men and took them with him. M\u012brz\u0101 Haidar, son of M. \u1e24usain G\u016brg\u0101n, who was the cousin of his Majesty G\u012bt\u016b-sit\u0101n\u012b Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b, had come with M. K\u0101mr\u0101n to Agra, and had enjoyed the privilege of serving his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, and had been treated with abundant favours. M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n made his own ailment an excuse and laboured to induce him (Haidar) to accompany him. The M\u012brz\u0101 showed himself favourably inclined towards M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and proceeded to excuse himself (to Hum\u0101y\u016bn), and out of want of consideration brought forward the matter of leave. His Majesty observed, \"If kindred be the point for consideration, you are equally related to us both; if loyalty and truth be regarded, the tie to me is closer. If glory and manliness be sought, you should accompany me for I am marching against the foe. As to what M. K\u0101mr\u0101n is representing about his illness, you are not a physician nor a druggist, that you should go with him. What the M\u012brz\u0101 imagines about Lahor's being a place of safety, is idle for, if anything is clear as the result of his holding back from this expedition, it is that he will not find a corner of safety in India.

M. K\u0101mr\u0101n out of his abundant forces contributed 3,000 men under the command (b\u0101\u02bfl\u012bqi) of M. \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h Mughul, and did not himself obtain the blessing of service.\n\n1 This account is abridged from the T\u0101r.

See Elias & Ross, 472 et seq.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nMARCH OF HIS MAJESTY JAHANBANI JANNAAT-ASHIYANI'S ARMY FROM AGRA, THE CAPITAL, TO THE EASTERN PROVINCES FOR SUPPRESSING SHER KHAN'S REBELLION; THE RETURN AFTER CONTESTS, AND THE ADMONITORY EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED.\n\nAs the wondrous artists of fate's picture gallery pursue divers methods of painting and decoration, it is matter for thanksgiving and not for complaint if their workmanship on this occasion be not in accordance with desires. Hence God the world-artificer removed concord from the illustrious brotherhood and converted combination into separation. His Majesty went with few forces against many enemies, and out of a stout heart and native courage heeded not the paucity of friends and the plurality of foes.\n\nWhen the sublime army reached Bhujpur, Sher Khan came with a numerous force to the other side of the Ganges and encamped. His Majesty determined to cross the river with his small army, and in a short time a bridge was put together at the Bhujpur ferry. About 150 heroes made themselves ready for the fray and plunged into the river like sea-lions, heedless of the waves and whirlpools. Like river-traversing crocodiles they rushed into the treacherous deep and crossing over, routed the numerous enemy. After giving proof of their courage and accomplishing their object, they were returning to the camp, and when they came near the bridge the Afghans brought forward the elephant Girdbaz, which had remained with the enemy at the battle of Causa, to break down the bridge. That enormous elephant approached the head of the bridge and broke-\n\n---\n\n1 This is the Bhujpur in Sarkar Qanauj. Jarrett II, 184. It is in the Farukhabad District, 8 miles south-east of Farukhabad and 31 miles north-west (upstream) of Qanauj.\n\n2 Chalmers' MS. has Girdbad.\nits supports. Just then a cannon ball from the royal camp amputated the legs of the elephant Girdb\u0101z, and the enemy which was pressing on, was put to flight. The gallant men who had signified their devotion returned in safety. The plan of campaign was that the army should march along the river bank to Qanauj. They proceeded warily and slowly, march by march. On the way the enemy's boats came in sight. A gun was fired from the royal artillery, and a large boat of the foe was broken to pieces, and was shivered by the dashing of the waves of vengeance. For more than a month the armies confronted one another near Qanauj. At length Muhammad Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 and his sons Ulugh M\u012brz\u0101 and Sh\u0101h M\u012brz\u0101\u2014who traced their genealogy up to \u1e62ahib Qir\u0101n\u012b, and were daughter's grandsons of Sult\u0101n Husain M\u012brz\u0101 and had been exalted by serving Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b, and who, after his death, had set themselves in opposition to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b, (as has already been alluded to)\u2014finding neither glory nor profit in vain strife, and that strife-mongering against their benefactor was unsuccessful, returned to the threshold of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and proffered the prostration of obedience. His Majesty from his perfect kindness and liberality regarded their committed offences as uncommitted, forgave them and treated them with royal favours. But as they were radically bad and ungrateful, they again out of worthlessness and inaptitude took to flight at such a crisis and withdrew their feet from the sphere of constancy and patience. They also pointed the way of desertion to other wretches, so that many took the path of disloyalty and withdrew themselves. To his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b it appeared the proper course to cross the river and to engage at any cost, so that any form which was to emerge from the screen of secrecy might show its full face. If they delayed, things might take another (i.e. adverse) turn and a large number might desert. With the view then of putting an obstacle in the way of desertion, a bridge was made and a crossing\n\n---\n\n1 Chalmers is probably right in translating this \"deprived the elephant of one of its legs.\"\n2 If would seem however that Hum\u0101y\u016bn did not succeed in crossing the river with his main army, though presumably that was the reason for making this bridge.\n3 See Errata to text.\n4 Sul\u1e6d\u0101na B\u0113gam, the eldest daughter of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Husain of Her\u0101t.

A trench was dug in front of the army, and the artillery carriages were put into position and redoubts (m\u016brcalh\u0101) constructed. Opposite to this, Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n drew up a crowd of rebels and encamped after digging a trench. Every day the young men on each side came out and engaged. Meanwhile the sun entered Cancer,\\(^1\\) and the rainy season began. The clouds gathered with tumult, like rutting elephants, and distilled moisture. The encampment became flooded, and they were compelled to seek for high ground which should be free from water and mud, and where the tents, the artillery-park, &c. might be placed. It was arranged that the army should be drawn out on the morning of the \u2018\u0100sh\u0101r day, (10th Mu\u1e25arram) and that if the enemy should come out of his trenches and advance, they would fight, and if he remained stationary, they would encamp in the selected spot. With this view they mounted their horses on 10th Mu\u1e25arram 947 (17th May, 1540), and drew up their lines.

The centre was dignified by the presence of his Majesty; M. Hind\u0101l had the fore-centre; M. \u2018Askar\u012b the right wing, and Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 the left.\n\nM.

Khaw\u0101ss Kh\u0101n, Barmazid and many others came opposite M. \u2018Askari.\n\nThe first encounter was between M. Hind\u0101l and Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n. A wondrous hand to hand fight occurred and Jal\u0101l Kh\u0101n fell from his horse. The royal left wing drove back the enemy to their centre. When Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n saw this, he made an onset in person with a large force, while Khaw\u0101ss Kh\u0101n and his companions fell upon M. \u2018Askari.\n\nAs soon as the Afgh\u0101ns attacked, many officers did not stand their ground but gave way. His Majesty twice attacked the foe and threw them into confusion. Though it is not reckoned that the king himself should share in a fray, yet at that time of testing manhood, how could rules be adhered to? Hence two lances were broken in his Majesty\u2019s hands on that occasion and the claims of endeavour and courage were satisfied. But the brothers did not show brotherhood, and the captains did not keep the foot of fortitude in the circle of steadfastness, but from superfluity of naughtiness were negligent, and brought disaster on their lord. It would seem as though when this externally and internally great man, who saw with the eyes of truth and was capable of contemplating mysteries, went on this expedition with such a small army, full of hypocrisy, empty of sincerity, it had crossed his lofty mind that it was many degrees better to hasten to the city of annihilation on the steed of valour and to urge on the horse of his life to the goal of nothingness, than to be courteous to friendship-affecting enemies, to league oneself in hypocrisy with them, and to play the game (nard) of altercation (radd \u016b badl) with unfair gamesters. Better a mirage (sar\u0101b) than a river (\u0101b\u012b) which must be drunk* in company with those wretches (\u0101br\u016by\u0101n)! Such to men of the world clearly appeared to be the case from his method of personal onset. Some of the loyal and single-hearted smote the hand of intercession and solicitude on the stirrup of dominion and forcibly withdrew him. This I say looking to the processes of the world of secondary causes. But in the world of reality, it was God, the world adorner, who withdrew him!

One school of sages considers that such events are intended to quicken the attention and to arouse the noble-minded, and are not of the nature of recompense for actions. Accordingly it was held by ancient philosophers that worldly calamities were a process of polishing for the elect, and of rusting for the crowd. A number of the enlightened and pure-hearted are of opinion that such occurrences are a process of education. When the stewards of fate's workshop are advancing a chosen vessel to a lofty rank, they first make him compact of all worldly states, of joy and sorrow, health and sickness, ease and labour, expansion and contraction, so that he may be fitted for the lofty rank of sovereignty. And many of the swift traversers of the fields of contemplation are agreed that the reason of such trials is because it is God's will that whenever the boon of greatness is to be bestowed on an auspicious one and the time of attaining that blessing be close at hand, there should be in that period's antechamber a station of labours, and a vent of trials; and that the dust of blemish should mark the skirts of his grandeur and glory so that when he hath ascended to the perfect stage and the most distant height, this mole-stain may prove his charm against the fatal eye. To speak more clearly; as the times of the appearances of the Holy Light in mortal manifesters and human ascension-points\u2014such as was the holy office of her Majesty Alanq\u016b\u0101\u2014were made resplendent in mysterious withdrawals and apparitions of divers individuals, and so planted themselves in the visible world, and were acquiring, under God's special supervision, the acm\u00e9 of development, so,\u2014now that the period of the showing forth of the final cause of that Light, to wit, the holy incarnation of his Majesty, the king of kings, was at hand,\u2014untoward occurrences were made the prophylactic charm of this great blessing.\n\n1 *Sipand*, wild rue.

And now I return from the unveiling of mysteries to the thread of my narrative.\n\nIn fine, when defeat (shikasti), which was to lay the foundation of the righting (durusti) of the world, made its appearance, the officers fled without fighting to the bank of the Ganges, which was about four miles (a farsakh) distant, and as the requital of their disloyalty and ingratitude, sank in the whirlpool of disappointment, giving the vessels of their lives to the boisterous waters of annihilation in recompense of their unrighteousness. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b mounted with firm foot on an elephant and proceeded across the river. He descended from the elephant at the water's edge and was looking around for an exit. As the bank was high, no way out presented itself. One of the soldiers who had been saved out of the whirlpool came there and seizing his Majesty's sacred hand drew him up. In truth he then, by help of heaven's favouring hand, drew to himself fortune and power. His Majesty asked him his name and birthplace. He made answer \"My name is Shamsu-d-din Muhammad, my birthplace is Ghazn\u012b, and I am a servant of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n.\" His Majesty made him hopeful of princely favours. Just then Muqaddam B\u0113g, one of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n's officers, recognised his Majesty and enrolled himself among those who had received the gospel of good fortune. Acting upon this, he brought forward his horse, and obtained the news of distinction from royal promises. His Majesty proceeded from there towards Agra, and was joined on the way by the Mirz\u0101s. When they came to the environs of Bhang\u0101pur the villagers closed the market against the king's men, and behaved in an unruly manner, attacking every one who fell into their hands. When the august mind was informed of this, M. 'Askari, Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M. and M. Hind\u0101l were ordered to attack the villains and to chastise them. Nearly 3,000 horse and foot of the insolent knaves had gathered together. When the royal order arrived, M. 'Askari delayed\n\n1 Apparently all that is meant is that he entered Hum\u0101y\u016bn's service.\n2 Probably the man mentioned in B\u0101bar's Mem. 400 and 401 as a servant of Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n.\n3 See Erskine, Hist. II, 192n. The place meant is Bhang\u0101n in the Mainp\u016br\u012b district, and on the Grand Trunk Road. Jarrett II, 184, where it is spelt Bh\u016bg\u0101n (note by Mr. Irvine.)\nto proceed and Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br M\u012brz\u0101 gave him some strokes with his whip, saying that it was from his discord that things had come to such a pass. Still he did not take warning, and Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br M\u012brz\u0101 and M. Hind\u0101l obeyed and went against the crowd. A great fight ensued, and a large number of the ill-fated villagers (g\u016bw\u0101r\u0101n) were killed. The M\u012brz\u0101s after giving them a lesson returned, and M. \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b who had come to complain, was reprehended. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b hastened on to Agra. The provinces were in confusion and sedition raised its head on every side. Next morning his Majesty proceeded to the dwelling of that great exemplar, Mir Raf\u012b\u2019,\u00b9 who was sprung from the \u1e62afav\u012b Sayyids, and was incomparable for knowledge and wisdom, and was the choice favourite of princes. He took counsel with him, and the final conclusion of his Majesty was that he should go towards the Panj\u0101b. If M. K\u0101mr\u0101n were helped by the sovereignty of reason and auspiciousness, and should bind on himself the girdle of good service and come actively forward to help, the rift of strife might still be closed. With this right intention he proceeded to L\u0101hor. M. \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b went to Sambal and M. Hind\u0101l to Alwar. On 18th Mu\u1e25arram (26th May, 1540) Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n joined the king near Dihli through the influence of B\u0113g M\u012brak, and a large body of men collected for the king\u2019s service. On the 20th he again set out, and on the 22nd M. Hind\u0101l and M. \u1e24aidar joined him in Rohtak.\u00b2 On the 23rd his Majesty halted there. The garrison shut the gate of the city in his face, thereby opening the doors of disgrace for themselves. His Majesty addressed himself to the attack and in a short space of time chastised the garrison. On 17th \u1e62afar the army arrived at Sihrind and on the 20th Mir Faqr \u2018Al\u012b closed life\u2019s litter while on the march. When the army approached L\u0101hor and were near Daulat Kh\u0101n\u2019s sar\u0101i, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n came forward to meet him and did homage. His Majesty alighted in the garden of Khw\u0101ja D\u014dst Munshi which is the most charming spot\n\n\u00b9 A. F.\u2019s mother belonged to this family. Cf. Jarrett III. 423, where Mir Raf\u012b\u2019 is called Mir Raf\u012b\u2019u-d-d\u012bn \u1e62afav\u012b of Ij (Shiraz). See also B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem. 345, 349. A. F. speaks in the \u0100in of his being one of the \u1e24asan and \u1e24usain\u012b Sayyids. He died in 954. Jarrett l.c. Raf\u012b\u2019 was one of the doctors who encouraged Sher Sh\u0101h to break his word to Pur\u0101n Mall and the garrison of Rais\u012bn.\n\n\u00b2 In the Panj\u0101b, 42 miles north-west of Dihli.\nin L\u0101hor, while M. Hind\u0101l took up his quarters in the garden of Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101z\u012b, who was then M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s d\u012bw\u0101n. After that M. \u2018Askar\u012b came from Sambal and settled himself in the house of Am\u012br Wali B\u0113g. At this time the fortunate Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Muhammad who had given his hand at the river-bank, arrived and was exalted by princely favours. On the 1st \u1e62afar, 947, all the noble brothers and Am\u012brs and other servants collected but in spite of so many lessons and celestial warnings, these fine fellows (\u2018a\u1e63\u012bz\u0101n) were not taught and did not bind the girdle of sincerity on the waist of resolve. Several times they gathered together on his Majesty\u2019s service, and deliberated and made vows and promises of unity and concord, and took the great and godly as their witnesses. Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101wand Mahm\u016bd, brother of Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-\u1e25aqq and Mir Abu-l-baq\u0101 frequently took part in the deliberations. At length one day all the M\u012brz\u0101s, nobles and grandees having been assembled, wrote out a deed (ta\u1e63k\u012bra) of concord and unanimity, and to this auspicious minute all the officers gave their signatures.\n\nWhen this record of confidence had been executed, the deliberations began. His Majesty gave lofty counsels and uttered excellent words. With his pearling tongue he said, \u201cThe miserable end of those who deviate from the straight highway of concord is known to all. Especially since not long ago when Sultan Husain M\u012brz\u0101 beat the drum of death in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, he left eighteen capable and fortune-favoured sons and yet, in spite of all their array of wealth, in consequence of fraternal discord, the kingdom of Khur\u0101s\u0101n (which for so many years had been a centre of peace), became in a short space a centre of calamities and was transferred to Sh\u0101h\u012b B\u0113g. No trace remained of any of the sons except of Badi\u2019u-z-zam\u0101n who went to Turkey, and all the sons of the M\u012brz\u0101 had been reviled and reprobated by\n\n---\n\n1 Three days after this Hum\u0101y\u016bn had a vision in which the coming birth of Akbar was announced. A. N. 13. Cf. Gulbadan\u2019s account, f. 39b.\n2 See T\u0101r. Rash., 395, where he is called Hazrat Makhdum\u012b N\u016bra. Abdu-l-\u1e25aqq was his younger brother.\n3 An exaggeration, which occurs also in the T\u0101r. Rash. (B. M. Ms. Or. 157, 348b) Sl. Husain had fourteen sons and of these, seven (according to Khw\u0101nd Am\u012br) died before their father.\n4 A. F. gives Hum\u0101y\u016bn the credit of this speech, but the T\u0101r. Rash., from which he no doubt copied it, ascribes it to Haidar. See p. 478.\n5 He too, it seems, went there as\nhigh and low. With what difficulty had his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b-Firdaus-mak\u0101ni conquered a Hind\u016bst\u0101n\u2014so vast a country! If through your disunion it pass from our possession into the hands of nobodies (n\u0101kas\u0101n) what will the wise say of you? Now is the time to sink the head into the bosom of good counsel and to exert it from jealousy\u2019s collar, so that you may attain headship among mankind, and be a means of gaining the favour of God.\u201d\n\nEvery one of the authors of compact and of the lords of confederacy forgot the recent agreements, and each declaimed according to his own good pleasure. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n said, \u201cWhat occurs to me is that the king and all the M\u012brz\u0101s should spend some days unencumbered in the mountains while I take their families to K\u0101bul. When I have put them into safety, I shall return and join you.\u201d M. Hind\u0101l and Y\u0101dg\u0101r Na\u1e63\u012br M\u012brz\u0101 said, \u201cAt present we cannot fight the Afgh\u0101ns. The thing to do now is to go to Bhakkar and to subdue that country. By its means we shall conquer Gujrat, and when these two kingdoms have fallen into our hands and we have brought the business to an end, the deliverance of this country (India) will be effected in an admirable manner.\u201d M. \u1e24aidar said, \u201cIt is proper that all the M\u012brz\u0101s should settle down after securing the slopes from the mountains of Sihrind to those of S\u0101rang.1 I engage that with a small force I will in two months get possession of Kashmir. When that news comes, let every man send his belongings to Kashmir, for there is no safer place. It will take Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n four months to arrive and he will not be able to bring into the hill country the gun-carriages and\n\n---\n\n1 See T\u0101r. Rash\u012bd., 479n. Mr. Elias is no doubt right in considering that S\u0101rang is not a place-name. There is an Afgh\u0101n tribe in the Salt Range called the S\u0101rangz\u0101\u012b, (Temple, J. A. S. B., 1880, pp. 101 and 106), and perhaps \u1e24aidar M. referred to them rather than to an individual. His idea was that the Mughuls should occupy the lower ranges between the Indus and Kashmir, i.e., from Sihrind in the S. E. to Rawalpindi on the N. W. For Sultan S\u0101rang, see Blochmann 456; and Delmerick, J. A. S. B. 1871, p. 87. He was Sultan \u0100dam\u2019s brother and must have died in Sh\u0113r Sh\u0101h\u2019s time, for it was Sultan \u0100dam who delivered up K\u0101mr\u0101n to Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\ncannon which are the support\\(^1\\) of his warfare. In a short time the Afgh\u0101n army will be ruined.\"\n\nAs their words and their hearts were not in unison, the meeting ended without any conclusive speech. Whatever proposals were brought forward, and whatever sound advice his Majesty communicated in the hope that perchance the lamp of wisdom might be lighted for M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and that he would turn away from his dark ideas and come to the abode of candour, the Mirz\u0101 did not alter what he had said. All his endeavour was that every one should be ruined, and he counted it a gain that he himself might go to K\u0101bul and secure a corner for his own enjoyment. He was perpetually occupied with evil thoughts, and fortune-conferring words did not arouse him. Ostensibly he breathed unanimity and would say, \"I shall come forth in some fortunate hour and shall gird on the belt of courage and fight the foe with singleness of heart.\" But secretly he was strengthening the foundations of opposition, and this to such an extent that out of wickedness and blindness, he privately sent Q\u0101\u1e63\u012b \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h his \u1e63adr to Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n, that he might establish friendly relations with him, and made a contract of affection with him. He sought the fulfilment of his desires from the help of enemies, and he wrote a letter to the effect that if the Panj\u0101b were secured to him as formerly, he would soon bring affairs to a successful issue!\n\nAfter these occurrences Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n came to Dihl\u012b, but did not advance further. He saw that what had happened was due to his good fortune, and was apprehensive lest if he went on further, his affairs would retrograde. He was extremely frightened about the combination which he heard was making progress in L\u0101hor. Meanwhile the seditions \u1e63adr (\u1e63adr-i-pur-ghadar) who added vile malice to natural baseness, arrived. Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n whose centre was pivoted in craft, warmly embraced him, and was a thousand times emboldened\\(^2\\) by the good news of disunion. He gave him an answer in accordance with the Mirz\u0101\u2019s requests. That wretch (the \u1e63adr) instigated him to make a hostile advance, and held out prospects of desertion. Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n sent a crafty fellow along with him to ascertain the real state of affairs and then return. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n received Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n\u2019s am-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bab\u0101r\u2019s Mem, 416, mentions that the Bengalis, i.e., the Afgh\u0101ns, are famous for their skill in artillery.\n\n\\(^2\\) Lit. one heart became a thousand.\nbassador in the garden at L\u0101hor, and held a feast on that day. He also by entreaties induced his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b to come there.\n\nThat crude, short-sighted M\u012brz\u0101 again sent the same wretch (his \u1e63adr) to Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n. On this occasion the betrayer of his salt came to the bank of the Sult\u0101np\u016br river, and brought forward disloyal proposals and encouraged Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n to cross the river. Thereupon Mu\u1e93affar Turkm\u0101n, who was stationed on outpost duty near the Sult\u0101np\u016br river, came and reported to his Majesty that the enemy had crossed the river (the Bi\u0101s) and killed his brother\u2019s son Junaid B\u0113g, who from his qualities of mind and body was a persona grata at Court.\n\nIn the end of Jum\u0101da-l-\u0101khir his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and the M\u012brz\u0101s crossed the L\u0101hor river (the R\u0101v\u012b), which was fordable, and marched stage by stage to the C\u012bn\u0101b. As his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was resolved to attempt Kashmir, he sent a body of troops in advance with M. Haidar to that province. For, when M. K\u0101mr\u0101n made a rapid march to Qandah\u0101r to contend with S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101, he left M. Haidar in charge of L\u0101hor. Khw\u0101ja H\u0101j\u012b, \u2018Abdu-l-m\u0101kri,1 Zang\u012b Cak, and many of the nobles were opposed to the ruler of Kashmir and came to L\u0101hor in order that by their intimacy with M. Haidar they might obtain an army from M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and so get possession of Kashmir. Though M. Haidar exerted himself, their wish was not fulfilled. When M. Hind\u0101l raised a disturbance by having the khutba read in his own name, and M. K\u0101mr\u0101n marched from L\u0101hor to Agra, M. Haidar by great exertions contrived to raise an army and to despatch it from the capital2 under the charge of B\u0101b\u0101 J\u016bjak3 who was one of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s superior officers. His design was that this force should proceed to Kashmir under the guidance of the Kashmiri nobles aforesaid, and take possession thereof. B\u0101b\u0101 J\u016bjak was negligent in setting out and meanwhile the disaster of Causa ferry, which was a blow to eternal dominion, came to be known. He gave\n\n---\n\n1 Text, B\u0101kri, but the variant M\u0101kr\u012b is right. Zang\u012b is Rumk\u012b in text.\n2 Agra. See T\u0101r. Rash. 482.\n3 T\u0101r. Rash., C\u016bcak Haidar does not say he was an officer of K\u0101mr\u0101n and apparently he was a Kashmiri. It appears from Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn and from Jarrett II, 390, that there was an expedition before this from the Panjab and that K\u0101mr\u0101n sent one, Mu\u1e25ammad B\u0113g into Kashmir but that after plundering he had to return. Apparently this was not long after Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s accession.\nup the expedition, and the Kashmiri nobles tarried in Naushahr, Rajanuri and the hollows of the hills in the expectation of some event.\n\nBut they were continually writing letters to M. Haidar full of the advantages of conquering Kashmir, and the Mirz\u0101 used to bring these to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s notice. His holy heart grew daily more and more eager to visit the charming country of Kashmir, and meanwhile he gave permission to the Mirz\u0101 to proceed in the first place to Naushahr with a body of troops. If the Kashmiri nobles, who were always urging the expedition, should come forward, Sikandar T\u016bpc\u012b, who was a fief-holder in that neighbourhood, was to join him with his troops. When he got to the passes, Amir Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n, who was one of the high officers of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b, and of whom some account has already been given, was to come and help. As soon as the news of Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n B\u0113g\u2019s arrival should reach his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b he would proceed in person towards that province. His Majesty was on the bank (the right or west bank) of the Cin\u0101b when M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and \u2018Askari Mirz\u0101 went off to Kabul with Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-haqq and Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101wand Mahm\u016bd. Muhammad Sult\u0101n Mirz\u0101, Ulugh B\u0113g Mirz\u0101 and Sh\u0101h Mirz\u0101 on hearing, in the territory of Mult\u0101n, about the separation, joined M. K\u0101mr\u0101n on the bank of the Indus. In the beginning of Rajab, 947, M. Hind\u0101l, Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 and Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sult\u0101n succeeded by importunity in taking his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b off to Sind, though his intention had been to march to Kashmir. Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n B\u0113g, who had promised to accompany his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiyan\u012b, went off from Siy\u0101lk\u016bt and joined M. K\u0101mr\u0101n. Sikandar T\u016bpc\u012b withdrew to the S\u0101rang hills. In the same Rajab, after his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had gone towards Sind at the Mirz\u0101\u2019s instigation they, after going some stages, left him out of thoughtlessness and the suggestions of B\u0113g Mirak, who had abandoned his service and joined them. Meanwhile Q\u0101zi \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h arrived with some Afghans. M. Hind\u0101l\u2019s scouts seized them and brought them before him. The ill-fated Afghans were put to death, but the wretch \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h having still some breaths of his life remaining, escaped punishment at the intercession of Mir B\u0101b\u0101.\n\n---\n\n1 In the Peshawar district.\n2 I believe this to be the father of Hamida, Akbar\u2019s mother. See Gulbadan who calls Hamida\u2019s father Mir B\u0101b\u0101 D\u014dst. As he was a teacher in Hind\u0101l\u2019s service he might naturally intercede for a learned man.\nDost. For twenty days the Mirz\u0101s wandered in the desert of astonishment. They had no idea what to do or where to go. They were severed from fortune and auspiciousness, and having left dominion's fellowship, they had lost their object. As they had not followed the path of purpose, they were astonished and confounded. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had gone by way of the desert towards Bhakkar, and was wending his way according to guess and conjecture. They found no water, and there was no grain, but went on under the guidance of endurance and with the rations (z\u0101d) of reliance upon God. At length one day they heard the sound of a kettle-drum. On inquiry, it was found that M. Hind\u0101l and Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 were three k\u016bs away and were pacing the valley of search. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b sent Mir Ab\u016b'l-baq\u0101, who had left the society of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, and become a companion of the sublime army, to the Mirz\u0101s to give them information about the camping ground, and to speak wise words and advise them to come and kiss the sublime threshold. The Mir in accordance with these instructions counselled the Mirz\u0101s and acted as their guide to the blessing of service. They proceeded in harmony towards Bhakkar. Khaw\u0101ss Kh\u0101n and a large army of Afgh\u0101ns was coming up in the rear, but though the imperial army was very small, the former had not the courage to give battle. In the end of Sha'b\u0101n (last days of 1540) when the camp reached \u016ac\u00b9 the Amir Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad B\u0101qir \u1e24usain\u012b, who was the frontispiece of Sayyids and of the 'Ulam\u0101 of the age, expired and was buried there. His Majesty grieved much for his death, but as this evil earth is a scene of departure and dismissal (guz\u0101sh\u0101nti u guz\u0101sh\u0101nti), he displayed that resignation to the Divine command which is the ornament of those whose regard is fixed on the station of submission (maq\u0101m-i-taslim). When they had encamped near the residence of Bakhsh\u016b Lang\u0101 one of the landholders and grandees of that part, an order of grace and a mandate of favour was sent together with a glorious khil'at by B\u0113g Mu\u1e25ammad Bak\u0101wal, and Kacak B\u0113g, and hopes were held out that he should receive the title of Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n, a flag and a kettle-drum, and he was invited to do loyal service and to send corn to the camp. He came forth to meet the envoys, saluted them, and behaved with\n\n\u00b9 That is, arrived opposite \u016ac for they were travelling down the west side of the Cin\u0101b and between it and the Indus.\nrespect. Though he had not the good fortune to come and kiss the threshold, yet with regard to what was ordered, he showed obedience and alacrity, and also sent a proper present. Likewise he arranged for traders to bring articles for sale at the royal camp, and he provided many boats for crossing the river on the way to Bhakkar. Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br Mirz\u0101 went on with the advance guard, and on 28th Rama\u1e0d\u0101n (26th January, 1541), the army reached the neighbourhood of Bhakkar. Two days before this Q\u0101\u1e93\u012b Ghiy\u0101s\u016b-d-d\u012bn of J\u0101m, who was connected with the illustrious family,\u00b9 and was adorned with gifts and graces, was raised to the office of \u1e63adr.\n\nWhen by God\u2019s help they had passed through so many perils on the way and had reached the territory of Bhakkar, they pitched their tents at L\u016bhri (R\u016bhri) which is on the river bank\u00b2 and opposite Bhakkar. His Majesty took up his quarters in a garden on the environs which was unequalled for pleasantness and delight. Charming houses had been erected there and were made illustrious by his presence. The other gardens and houses were divided among his followers. M. Hind\u0101l went four or five k\u014ds and encamped, and some days afterwards made his station on the other side of the river. Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br Mirz\u0101 also settled afterwards on that side. Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd of Bhakkar, who was a servant of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101h Husain B\u0113g Argh\u016bn, laid waste the Bhakkar territory and strengthened the fort. He also took away the boats from this (the east) side of the river, and anchored them under the fort. This Sh\u0101h Husain B\u0113g was the son of the Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101h B\u0113g Argh\u016bn who, when his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-s\u012bt\u0101n\u012b Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b took Qandah\u0101r from him came to Tatta and Bhakkar and brought all that country into his subjection.\n\nWhen the majestic army established the light (far) of its rendezvous at L\u016bhri, a lofty mandate was sent to Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd calling upon him to pay his respects and to deliver up the fort to the royal servants. He represented in reply that he was the servant of Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101h Husain, and that so long as the latter did not come, it would not be consistent with loyalty for him to present himself, nor could\n\n\u00b9 Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s mother was connected with Ahmad J\u0101m, and so was his wife, the mother of Akbar.

Such and such like were the expressions of inability that he used. His Majesty accepted his excuses, and sent Amir T\u0101hir \u1e63adr and Mir Samandar, two of his confidential servants, to M. Sh\u0101h Husain at Tatta, and dignified him by promises of favour. M. Sh\u0101h Husain received the envoys with respect, and sent Shaikh Mirak, the flower of the descendants of Shaikh Pur\u0101n whom all the Argh\u016bns reverence and rely upon from old times, as a messenger, and with a suitable present, to accompany the royal ambassadors to the Court. He represented that the district of Bhakkar yielded little, while that of H\u0101jk\u0101n\u00b9 was rich and populous and possessed much corn; that it was fitting that his Majesty should turn his reins towards it and take it into his possession, and that in that way the army would be comfortable, and also he (Sh\u0101h Hussain) would be at hand with his service. It was a fortunate and auspicious circumstance for him that his Majesty should now come to those parts, and that in course of time his fears and apprehensions would disappear and he would do himself the honour of paying his respects. He also represented that after he had had the gratification of paying his respects, his Majesty would, with a little exertion, be able to bring Gujrat into his possession, when the other territories of Hind\u016bst\u0101n would fall into his hands. That sordid one converted duties (buq\u016bq) into disobediences ('uq\u016bq) and coming forth by the door of deceit and dissimulation, made a display of false though fair-seeming expressions. His Majesty appointed M. Hind\u0101l to P\u0101tar\u00b2 and its territory, and himself spent five or six months in the\n\n\u00b9 Jarrett II. 340.\n\u00b2 In Sark\u0101r Siwast\u0101n (Sehw\u0101n) and lower down the Indus then Bhakkar. Jarrett II. 340, where it is spelt B\u0101tar, but with the variant P\u0101tar. N\u012bg\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn says it is 50 kos from L\u016bhr\u012b. Jauhar, 30, says it is 20 miles west of the Indus. It is perhaps the Pir Patt\u0101 of Burnes\u2019s journey to Kabul, p. 10. The best account of it is in Major-General Haig\u2019s Indus Delta (1894), p. 91, note. He says \u201cThe ruins of the town of P\u0101t, where in August, 1541, Hum\u0101y\u016bn married Hamida, and where some time later (since 1545) his brother K\u0101mr\u0101n married the daughter of Sh\u0101h Huseyn lies a little to the east of the present village of that name in the Kakar Pargana, and bears the name of P\u0101t-kuhna (old P\u0101t). On the west side of the old site, and separating it from the new village, is an old channel, now containing standing water. In this channel, says a local chronicle relating to that part of the country, the river ran at the time of\npleasant spot of L\u016bhri in the hope that the ruler of Tatta would enter on the right path. During this interval he honoured M. Him by visiting him in his camp at P\u0101tar.\n\nAs the period of the appearance of the light of fortune and the rise of the star of glory and grandeur,\u2014which should give grace to spiritual and physical beauty and be the perfect beautifier of the world and the next,\u2014were approaching, so did the apparatus for the attainment of this grand blessing and the notes of the existence of this supreme gift become more and more prepared. The waiting eyes of the heavenly saints of many thousands of years were brightened by the bounteous advent of that nurling of light, and the dim evening of earthly hopes assumed the beauty of the morning from the glory of the coming light of that great pearl of the Caliphate's diadem. For it was on this expedition and in a most excellent season and point of time, that in the year 948\\(^1\\) he brought Her Highness Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b, the sacred and noble lady, the glory of whose chastity and purity and the light of whose sovereignty and sainthood, show forth from her lustrous brow, into the bond of matrimony, with lordly ceremonies and royal rites. A festival of fortune was arranged, and coins from the treasury of gifts were showered on the head of the world, and hearts were rejoiced by blissful favours. Khw\u0101ja Hijr\u012b\\(^2\\) of J\u0101m rendered good service in this auspicious affair. Thereafter the yoke-fellows of blessing and fortune proceeded towards the camp. For a time the territory of Bhakkar was their place of residence. Gradually, owing to the disloyalty of the landholders, corn became dear\n\n---\n\nHum\u0101y\u016bn's visit, so that coming from Babarlo (a little to the south of R\u014dhri) by Bh\u0113t\u0101n\u012b in Kandh\u0101r\u0101 and Darbelo, he had no water to cross. The river now runs (or did a few years ago) 5 or 6 miles east, and also 3 miles south of P\u0101t. The place gave its name to an extensive and very fertile tract of country in former times.\\(^3\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) A. F. does not give the month and day. Gulbadan says, p. 43b, that the marriage took place at midday on a Monday in the beginning of Jum\u0101da-l-awwal, 948, and that Hum\u0101y\u016bn himself took the astrolabe and calculated the auspicious moment.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Bad\u0101oni III. 396. Hajr\u012b was a religious poet, and apparently the meaning is that he celebrated the marriage in verse. He was a descendant of Ahmad J\u0101m. He called himself Hassan Hijr\u012b, the last being an assumed name and signifying apparently that he was one who lived apart.\nand the country was made desolate. Imbecile apprehensions and improper schemes passed into the minds of the Mirz\u0101s who were his Majesty's companions,\u2014such thoughts as might be entertained and impressed on the minds of the insincere\u2014till at length M. Hind\u0101l, at the instigation of Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 who was always secretly in opposition, and by the stirring up of Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n who held the government of Qandah\u0101r on M. K\u0101mr\u0101n's behalf, set off and went to Qandah\u0101r. He also sent a man to Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 to tell him of his own departure, and to call upon him to do likewise.\n\nWhen his Majesty heard of this he went on Tuesday, 18th Jum\u0101da'l-awwal, 948 (September, 1 1541), to the quarters of M\u012br Ab\u016b'l-baq\u0101 and held a conference with him. He then sent him, under the most respectful circumstances, as an envoy to Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101, that he might bring him from the danger-spot of error to the straight path of rectitude. The M\u012br went and by judicious counsels brought the Mirz\u0101 back from the path of opposition to the highway of concord, and by his faithful and truthful utterances withheld him from improper schemes. He settled that the Mirz\u0101 should cross the river and acknowledge service, and should henceforth remain steadily in the fore-court of submission and devotion. The conditions were that when Hind\u016bst\u0101n should be conquered, the Mirz\u0101 should get one-third, and that when they arrived at K\u0101bul, he should have Ghazn\u012b, Carkh and L\u014dhghar, which his Majesty G\u012bti-sit\u0101n\u012b, Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b had given to the Mirz\u0101's mother. On Wednesday the M\u012br proceeded to return after fulfilling his mission. The men of the fort of Bhakkar got news of his departure and sent a force against his boat, and discharged a shower of arrows on the M\u012br. He received several dangerous wounds, and died next day. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was exceedingly grieved at this, and said with his truth-speaking tongue, that the oppositions and contumacies of brothers, the ingratitude of those whom his salt had nourished, and the helplessness of comrades and friends whereby the kingdom of India had been lost and many troubles had appeared, were all but one side to (i.e.,\n\n---\n\n1 18th Jum\u0101da'l-awwal would apparently be 11th September, 1541, but then the 18th was a Saturday, not a Tuesday. Perhaps A. F. wrote 13th.\n2 B\u0101bar's Mem. 148, Jarrett II. 406.\n3 B\u0101bar's sister-in-law, widow of his youngest brother N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101.\nwere all equalled or balanced by) the loss of the Mir; nay, those calamities did not equal this one. And in truth the Mir's eminence was such as he in his appreciation declared it to be. But inasmuch as passing wisdom and right-thinking were rooted in his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b's sacred person and were supreme there, an event like this, which might have been a place of stumbling to the saints of faith and might, made him draw nigh to perfect wisdom and swayed him to submission and resignation. Even in such a wisdom-robbing catastrophe, which might have displaced many a man's foot of patience, this wise and God-fearing one took counsel with God-given reason and submitted to the Divine will. Or if by reason of the onsets of circumstance, and the constraining power of his temperament, he could not attain to this blissful retreat, he put aside sighing and crying, as is the manner of those whose hearts are tied and bound to outer things, and was contented with the narrow pass (tangn\u0101i) of long-suffering patience. Praise be to God that though his Majesty was at first, owing to his humanity, somewhat overcome by cares and afflictions, yet under the guidance of right reason he became cheerful under worldly troubles and recognised good in the Divine decrees, according to the fashion of the pious and steady of eye who bind nosegays and gather fruit in the rose-garden of submission and resignation, and who come to contemplate with truth-\n\ndiscerning eyes the flowers of such gardens. Five or six days after this presaging disaster, Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 crossed the river and had the good fortune to do homage to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, who gave him a gracious reception. Meantime Shaikh Mirak, the ambassador from Tatta, received his cong\u00e9 and a rescript was sent to the ruler of Tatta, to the effect that his representations were accepted on condition that he faithfully came and did homage. The ruler of Tatta for a time gave out that he was coming. As his words were unillumined by sincerity's lamp, they did not attain the glory of performance. At length his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b granted Bhakkar and its territory to Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 and in the beginning of Jum\u0101da'-l-akhir, 948,\n\n---\n\n1 It was the Mir who made the remark which led to B\u0101bar's devoting himself for Hum\u0101y\u016bn's recovery from sickness, so Hum\u0101y\u016bn may have thought he was indebted to him for his life. The Mir is mentioned in the T\u0101r. Ras\u016bl. 478. It was he also who arranged about the marriage of Hum\u0101y\u016bn and \u1e24amida. See Gulbadan's Mem. p. 43b.\n(latter half of September, 1541), marched against Tatta. Having given to the Mirz\u0101 that bad country which by the benediction of kingly justice had turned its face towards civilization and became rich in corn and vegetables, he moved forward. Near the castle of Sehw\u0101n, Fa\u1e63\u012bl B\u0113g the brother of Mun'im Kh\u0101n, Tar\u0101sh B\u0113g, elder brother of Sh\u0101ham Kh\u0101n, and others, to the number of about twenty were proceeding by boat when a party came out from the castle and attacked them. They disembarked and assaulted the foe who fled into the castle. Some of these tigers of valour's forest went up to the fort, but as they were not supported, they withdrew and joined the camp. On 17th Rajab his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b reached Sehw\u0101n and invested the castle. Previous to this, the garrison had laid waste the buildings and gardens in the environs. During the siege the ruler of Tatta advanced, and blocking the way, prevented corn from reaching the camp. Owing to the protracted siege and the scanty supplies of corn, the base and dishonest began to desert and even the feet of great men, whose notions of rectitude had departed, came to slide from their places. For instance, Mir T\u0101hir \u1e63adr, Khw\u0101ja Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-din of J\u0101m, and Maul\u0101n\u0101 'Abdu-l-baq\u012b went off to the ruler of Tatta's camp, while Mir Barka, Mirz\u0101 Hasan, Zafar 'Al\u012b, son of Faqr 'Al\u012b B\u0113g, and Khw\u0101ja Mu\u1e25ibb 'Al\u012b Bakhtsh\u012b hastened off to Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101. At this time it came to his Majesty's ears that Mun'im Kh\u0101n, Fa\u1e63\u012bl B\u0113g and many others had joined together and were intending to withdraw. His Majesty as a precautionary measure imprisoned Mun'im Kh\u0101n, their ringleader. I shall now stop this part of the narrative, and give some account of Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101.\n\nAccount of Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101.\n\nHe made L\u016bhri his residence when his Majesty left him at Bhakkar. Twice did the garrison attack him by surprise, and, willing or unwilling, the Mirz\u0101 showed courage in these engagements. Mu\u1e25ammad 'Al\u012b Q\u0101b\u016bs (i.e., door-keeper) and Sh\u0113r-dil, both of them related to Mun'im Kh\u0101n, bravely drained the wholesome cup of martyrdom. On a third occasion, they (the enemy) had the daring to leave their boats and draw up their forces on the sands. On this occasion the Mirz\u0101's men showed such superiority that nearly 300 or 400 of the enemy were killed, and the hot sand was saturated with the evil blood of those victims. Such fear fell upon the enemy that they did not again venture to come\nout. Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101h Husain increased his craft and led the Mirz\u0101 out of the straight path. He sent his seal-bearer, B\u0101bar Quli, to him, representing that he was old and had no sympathiser, that he would give him his daughter in marriage and make over his treasures to him, that he did not wish to spend uselessly the few remaining days of his borrowed life, and that they two together might conquer Gujrat. In fine he deceived that simpleton by lying promises, and the latter being void of understanding and crooked in thought, stained his forehead with disloyalty. If he had had a particle of magnanimity or a glimmering of discernment, he would never even for valid promises have planted his foot in the circle of disloyalty, nor have hearkened to the interested representations of the perfidious, but would have practised honesty and kept his head erect!\n\nWhen his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b saw the straits to which the army was reduced, he sent a messenger to Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 requesting him to fall quickly upon the ruler of Tatta, who was blocking up the way, so that the army might emerge from the strait of difficulty into ample space. Though the Mirz\u0101 had in his heart became alienated, yet he preserved appearances a little by sending out an advance-camp. But with the same crudity of thought, he delayed and loitered in marching out. Thereupon his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b sent Shaikh \u2018Abdu-l-ghaf\u016br, who was sprung from the Shaikhs of Turkist\u0101n, and whom his Majesty had made one of his intimates, to contrive that\n\n1 Sh\u0101h Husain never had more than two wives, and from the first he soon passed. He never had a son.\n\n2 \u201cThe lying promises of \u2018Urq\u016bb.\u201d See Lane, 2032n.\n\n3 Yaki as mugarrab\u0101n-i-khud s\u0101kh-ta b\u016bdand. There are three variants, from mugarrab\u0101n: Mul\u0101sim\u0101n, M\u012br M\u0101l\u0101n\u2019 and M\u012br P\u0101l\u0101n. Apparently M\u012br M\u0101l\u0101n is right for Erskine has it in his MS. trs. B.M. Add. 26,607, and Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn describes \u2018Abdu-l-ghaf\u016br as Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s M\u012br-i-m\u0101l, i.e., (according to Blochmann VI), keeper of the privy purse. See also D\u2019Herbelot s.v. \u2018Miri\u2019. \u2018Abdu-l-\n\nghaf\u016br is perhaps the man mentioned in Blochmann 538, and whom Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn also names in the list of learned men and of whom he says that he for a long time taught in pargana \u2018Azimp\u016br. See also Bad\u0101oni III. 42. Evidently his language was unbecoming because he frightened Y\u0101dg\u0101r by giving him a bad account of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s position. Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn says that \u2018Abdu-l-ghaf\u016br gave such a description of the Emperor\u2019s difficulties that Y\u0101dg\u0101r and his men thought it best to await the takin of Bhakkar.\nthe Mirz\u0101 should advance quickly. But that worthless fellow walked crookedly and as the saying is,\n\nVerse.\u00b9\n\nThis very road on which you are going leads (also) to Turkist\u0101n.\n\nHe perverted his mission and by his improper language so affected the short-sighted Mirz\u0101 that he even neglected appearances and recalled his advance-camp. When his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b perceived that the times were so unpropitious, and that the army's difficulties were beyond conception, he saw that it was useless to remain longer near the fort (Sehw\u0101n), and proceeded on 17th Zil-qad\u0101 (23rd February, 1542), towards Bhakkar and L\u016bhr\u012b. At this juncture one of Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101's censurable acts was, that at the instigation of the ruler of Tatta, he seized and sent to him Gandam\u00b2 and H\u0101la, who were loyal zam\u012bnd\u0101rs, and had shown their loyalty by collecting boats, &c. That unrighteous one put them to death in punishment for the meritorious act of this service. His Majesty passed over this vile act and a hundred like it and was always for conciliation, thinking that perchance he (the Mirz\u0101) would write words of regret on the page of his actions and come into the house of amendment. When the sublime standards reached the borders of L\u016bhr\u012b, Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 came out with a body of men to attack the camp. His Majesty on hearing\n\n\u00b9 Gulist\u0101n Book II, Story 6. The whole verse is\u2014\n\n\"O Arab, I fear you'll never reach the Ka'ba,\nThe road you're on leads (also?) to Turkist\u0101n.\"\n\nThe meaning is not very clear, but I think it is, that all depends on how the face is set. The road leads to the Ka'ba, but also to Turkist\u0101n, i.e., in the opposite direction. I do not know if A. F. means to charge 'Abdu-l-ghaf\u016br with treachery, or only with awkwardness. Probably the latter is meant, the envoy having by his bad driving, made the Mirz\u0101 go back instead of forward. Perhaps there is a point in the envoy's belonging to Turkist\u0101n.\n\n\u00b2 This story is told at greater length by Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn. Elliot V. 210. H\u0101la is the name of a division in Sind (Hughes' Gazetteer, 185) and perhaps Gandam is a place name also. The Zam\u012bnd\u0101rs' offence was that they enabled Hum\u0101y\u016bn to cross the river from Bhakkar by raising some sunken boats. Gandam means wheat and Price so renders it, but here it seems to be a person's name.\n\n\u00b3 The clause begins with t\u0101 and perhaps what is meant is that they were sent in order to be put to death and not that this actually occurred.\nthis immediately got on horseback. H\u0101shim B\u0113g, who was one of the Mirz\u0101's right-thinking confidants, on hearing of this shameful proceeding, went quickly to him and violently seizing his rein, turned him back. He chided and reproved him, and speaking bitterly and harshly, said \"Apparently gentlemanly feeling, shame, respect and reverence have left the world. In what religion and by what canons of reason and sense, is it allowable to exhibit such levity and to set oneself up against one's benefactor?\"\n\nVerse.\n\nGood was that commander's saying,\nWatch the measure of thy work,\nPlant thy foot on the pedestal of thy ability,\nSo that thou make thyself a place on the sky-top.\nWhoever does not quit his own affairs,\nEats the fruit of whate'er he sows in this world.\n\nBy such wise counsels he brought the Mirz\u0101 back to Bandar Lahari. Meanwhile many, such as Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sult\u0101n, followed the path of error, and separated from his Majesty, and came over to Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101's side.\n\nReturn to the main narrative.\n\nWhen by the requirements of the mysteries of Divine wisdom and by the subtleties of eternal counsel, which arrange within the cover of every failure (n\u0101mur\u0101d\u012b) many materials of success (asb\u0101b-i-mur\u0101d), there was no form of success in Sind and when the decisive test for man's unmanliness had been applied, and the disloyalty of the army, the unhelpfulness of brothers, the folly of kindred and the unfavourableness of fortune had been revealed, his Majesty desired to don the dress of the recluse and the ascetic and to strike with the foot of longing into the desert path of the travellers on God's way, and to take up the circumambulation (halqa) of the ka'ba of purpose and\n\n1 This is either a mistake, or an unusual expression. Bandar Lahari is not L\u0101hr\u012b or R\u0101hr\u012b on the Indus, but a seaport at the mouth of the river and in sark\u0101r Tatta. Jarrett II. 339. Bhakkar is placed by A. F. in Mult\u0101n. Jarrett. 327.\n\n2 Halqa-i-ka'ba-i-mur\u0101d. Halqa means a ring and also a doorknocker but I suppose the meaning here is that Hum\u0101y\u016bn thought of going to Mecca and making a devotional circuit round the ka'ba.\nthe thread of the skirt of resolution, or to retire into a hermitage, preferring the cell of ease to the beholding of his contemporaries, and wishing to be far removed from this world full of care (\u0101s\u012bb) and worldlings full of craft (far\u012bb). All his right-thinking comrades who in weal and woe had waited on his stirrup and kept close to the reins of his society, besought him to abandon this idea and represented that the thing to be done now was to cast the shadow of fortune's Hum\u0101\u00b9 on the country of M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d and there to recruit his spirits, for M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d had repeatedly sent representations of devotion and made protestations of loyalty; that he had an army and an arsenal; that evidently he regarded this as a favourable opportunity and that when he was at the stirrup of good fortune, he would become a spring of good service, and that by degrees, the secret hopes and wishes of his Majesty's well-wishers would be fulfilled. His Majesty from a regard to the ideas of these faithful ones ordered a march towards that country. He sent a gracious rescript, together with salutary counsels, by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm B\u0113g Ish\u0101k \u0100q\u0101 to Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101, for perchance he might become conscious of his base acts and come to tread the path of repentance, and might depart from villany and display the grace of propriety. The following verse was endorsed on the letter:\n\nVerse.\n\nO thou moon-cheeked one, others' eye and lamp,\nI burn! How long wilt thou plaster others' scars?\n\nAs the slumbrous-witted M\u012brz\u0101 did not possess an awakening spirit, the expostulation made no impression on him. With the same old vain hopes he took the road of disloyalty and stayed behind in L\u016bhri. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b proceeded to \u016ac on 21st Mu\u1e25arram 949, and from thence went towards M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d on 18th\u00b2 Rab\u012b\u02bfu-l-awwal, and on the 14th idem halted at the foot of Dil\u0101w\u0101r.\u00b3 On the 20th\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Tar. Rash. 399, where Khw\u0101ja N\u016br bids Hum\u0101y\u016bn not to throw his shadow in a country where the parrot was rarer than the kite. Probably by this the saint meant Gaur where Hum\u0101y\u016bn was wasting his time. The saying is a common one, and is to be found in the Anw\u0101r-i-suhail\u012b.\n\n\u00b2 A note to text suggests that 18 is a mistake for 13.

On the way the far-seeing members of his retinue became apprehensive of the deceit and perfidy of M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d and represented this to his Majesty. They continually suggested that cautious action which is the illuminated border of fortune\u2019s rescript. At length M\u012br Samandar, who was at the head of men of sense, was sent on rapidly to M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d. He returned when he had penetrated the secrets of his heart, and represented that though M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d was making protestations of sincerity, it was evident that he did not possess the true light. When the standards of fortune approached his territory, Sank\u0101i (or Sang\u0101i) of N\u0101g\u014dr, who was one of M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d\u2019s confidants, came to the camp under pretext of trade and sought to purchase a valuable\u00b2 diamond. As his demeanour did not savour of rectitude, his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b bade them impress on this (would-be) buyer that such jewels were not to be obtained by purchase. They either fell by the shimmer of the flashing sword into the hands of him for whom Providence destined them, or were obtained by the favour of great monarchs. In fine, his Majesty was rendered even more cautious by the arrival of this cheat, and applauded the acuteness of Samandar. Again acting on vigilance and prudence which are the net with which princes work, especially in times of trouble and difficulty, he sent R\u0101\u012b Mal S\u016bn\u012b with instructions to go quickly to where M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d was and to report what he discovered. If unable to write, he was to communicate by means of a pre-arranged signal. That is, the signal of M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d\u2019s faithfulness was to be the messenger\u2019s clasping all his five fingers, and that of opposition and hypocrisy was to be the clasping of his little finger. The camp moved on two or three stages from Phal\u016bd\u012b\u00b3 which is thirty k\u016bs\n\n\u00b9 Text, W\u0101silp\u0101r, but see Errata. It is however W\u0101silp\u0101r in three B. M. MSS.\n\n\u00b2 This seems to be an allusion to the stone known as B\u0101bar\u2019s Diamond but which should be rather known as Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s. Hum\u0101y\u016bn carried it with him in his wanderings, and presented it to Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp. In Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s remarks there is a play on the word jauhar which means both a jewel and the wave-markings or lustre of a sword. Jauhar Aft\u016bb\u012b, p. 38, mentions that two of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s attendants told M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d that Hum\u0101y\u016bn had valuable jewels, and instigated him to demand them.\n\n\u00b3 Jarrett II. 276. \u201cPhalodi, a salt marsh in the north-west corner of the State, near the Jesalm\u012br frontier,\u201d Rajput\u0101n\u0101 Gazetteer II. 224, also\nfrom Jodhpur, the abode of Mald\u0113\u014d, and stopped at the K\u016bl-i-jog\u012b (the recluse\u2019s pond). R\u0101i Mal S\u016bni\u2019s courier arrived there, and clasped his little finger. This signal explained the state of matters, and afterwards it clearly appeared that the thoughts of this black-fated scoundrel were deceit and perfidy, and that he had an evil intention in sending a large body of men under pretence of setting off the welcome. His Majesty turned his reins towards Phal\u016bd\u012b. Yet many people are of opinion that Mald\u0113\u014d was in the first instance well-intentioned, and desirous of doing service, and that afterwards he was diverted from the right path either by learning the distressed condition of the troops and their small numbers, or by the false promises of Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n and by perceiving his ascendancy. Or he was withheld from help and service by his (Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n\u2019s) threats. In any case he abandoned the path of counsel and auspiciousness and turned the page of loyalty. The general opinion, however, is that from beginning to end his protestations of service and his sending petitions of obedience were all based upon hypocrisy and hostility.\n\nIn short, as at that time the adorners of the pinakothek of fate were engaged in decoration of another sort, nothing that his Majesty undertook came to any result, and trouble and wickedness appeared in every place when there was a prospect of good and of welfare. When the gilding of those counterfeit troops was subjected to the test, and the perfidy of Mald\u0113\u014d\u2019s unrighteous thoughts had been revealed in the ante-chamber of his Majesty\u2019s sacred heart, he ordered Tard\u012b B\u0113g Kh\u0101n, Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n and a number of his other servants to go out and stop the advance of the evil-minded ones and prevent them from putting foot in the sublime camp. After thus keeping them in check, they were to return but if an opportunity offered, they should defeat them. His Majesty marched on with a few devoted followers and with his veiled ladies. Among the soldiers were Shaikh \u2018Al\u012b B\u0113g Jal\u0101ir, Tars\u016bn B\u0113g, son of B\u0101b\u0101\n\n\u201cPhalodi is a large town to the north-west of M\u0101rw\u0101r near the borders of Bekanir and Jessalmir,\u201d l.c., p. 263.\n\n1 A.

There were also some domestic slaves and some faithful menials. Of learned\u00b9 men there were present Mull\u0101 T\u0101ju-d-d\u012bn and Maul\u0101n\u0101 C\u0101nd the astrologer.\u00b2\n\nWhen the camp had left Phal\u016bd\u012b and arrived at S\u0101talm\u012br,\u00b3 M\u0101ld\u014d\u014d\u2019s army appeared in sight, whilst the officers who had been despatched to check them, had lost their way and gone off in another direction, so that there was a passage for the enemy to the royal standards. His Majesty, who was a rock of power and a world of courage, placed the foot of steadfastness on the skirt of resolution and dignity, and turned against them with God-given reason and innate understanding. Many of the ladies were dismounted and their horses given to fighting men, and the troops having been distributed into three\u2074 bands, were sent against the foe. Shaikh \u2018Al\u012b B\u0113g with three or four trusty brethren advanced and attacked the enemy, who were huddled together in a defile. To attack them and to put them to flight was one and the same thing. A large number of them were killed, and by the Divine aid the king\u2019s servants obtained the victory. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b after returning thanks to God proceeded towards Jesalm\u012br, where he encamped in the beginning of Jum\u0101da\u2019l-awwal. At this stage the officers who had lost their way and whose minds had been distressed by agitations\u2075 experienced the blessing of service, and made the dust of the royal camp the collyrium of fortune\u2019s eye.

The tigers of fidelity's forest advanced and showing their superiority, defeated that vile crew. From thence they proceeded on towards the bounty-encompassed fort (\u1e25i\u1e63\u0101r-i-faiz-inh\u012bs\u0101r) of Amark\u014d\u1e6d on 10th Jum\u0101da'l-awwal (23rd August, 1542). After difficulties from hunger and thirst, the glory of arriving at that guarded fort (ha\u1e63n-i-ha\u1e63in), which is the ascension-point of glory and storehouse of fortune's jewel, was conferred upon them. The ruler of the fort, who was called R\u0101n\u0101 Pars\u0101d, regarded the sublime advent as a glorious adornment and tendered acceptable service.\n\nOne of the marvels (barak\u0101t) resulting from the sacred existence of his Majesty, the king of kings, which moved the wonder of the acute of the time, was that in that propitious period when her Majesty Maryam-mak\u0101ni was pregnant with that Unique of creation's workshop, she one day when she had been rapidly traversing the desert, had a longing for a pomegranate. In that waterless and grainless Sahara where it was difficult to find any trace of corn, the caterers for the holy court were in despair, when suddenly a man brought a bag (anb\u0101n) full of millet (jaw\u0101r) for sale. When they took him into the tent and were emptying his bag, suddenly a large, juicy pomegranate emerged. 'Twas a cause of joy and gladness, and an astonished world ascribed it to a miracle.\n\nSome days were spent in that delightful spot, and it was there that Tardi B\u0113g Kh\u0101n and many others who had accumulated goods and wealth\u2014all of it acquired by the abiding good fortune (of the royal house)\u2014grudged giving it in such a time of distress and difficulty, even when his Majesty asked for it! By the help of the R\u0101\u012b of Amark\u014d\u1e6d his Majesty got possession of the goods, and out of his perfect kindness, liberality and justice, distributed a portion among his followers for their expenses, but returned the bulk of it to\n\n---\n\n1 The Noonkarn of Todd.

How much more then they who are the elite of the court and bystanders of the pedestal of the sublime throne! May Almighty God hold aloft, for epochs and cycles, this chosen one from eternity on the masnad of bounty, and on the throne of the khilafat, that he may conduct the affairs of the world and of mankind.\n\nAs\u00b9 his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had in his mind the firm intention of marching forwards and as the time of the appearance of the Lord of Time and the Terrene was at hand, he, having ascertained the propitious hour, committed, on 1st Rajab, 949 (11th October, 1542), the litter of her Majesty Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b and some faithful followers to the world-upholding Creator, and with fortune and prestige set out on his expedition.\n\n\u00b9 According to the text this sentence closes the chapter, but I think it would have been better to end with the preceding paragraph.

As has already been stated, that nursing of Divine light emerged from the womb of concealment into the world of manifestation on the night of Sunday,\u00b2 5th Rajab, 949 (15th October, 1542), in order that all the sorrows of mortals might end in everlasting joy; that the sorrow-pelted heart of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b might receive the balm of assuagement; that the perturbed outer world might assume koemos and the rent-spiritual world be composed; that the spectators of Divine power (i.e., the angels) might rejoice over the spectacle of the accomplished fact and the expectants of the spiritual and temporal world have their desire satisfied; that to Wisdom there should come a master, to Justice a gracious father, to Perception a wise friend, to Law a righteous king, to Love an acute appreciator; that universal peace might have a wise daysman; that an adorer of the outward and a shewer-forth of the inward might appear. God be praised that in adequate correspondence with hope, there shone a dawn of union after a dark night of distraction, and that a morning of joy succeeded an evening of gloom. The desire of celestials was accomplished, the glory of terrestrials revealed. When this darkness-destroying refulgence and universe-lighting flash came from holy heaven and unveiled itself in that land\n\n\u00b9 A better sub-heading would be, \"Some account of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n.\"\n\u00b2 Saturday, according to our reckoning, the birth being early on Sunday morning.\nof roses, swift messengers hastened to convey the good news. While they were yet on the way, the heart of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b,\u2014for his far-seeing eye was on the watch on account of the secret intimation,\u2014became a thousand hearts from the life-giving good news. He prostrated himself in thanksgiving to Providence who had made fortune\u2019s rose bloom in the thorn-brake of misfortune, and had in the emptiness of failure, cast thousands of fruitions into his bosom. Within and without, there was a feast of joy, and all addressed themselves to enjoyment. The noble and the humble, the rich and poor, the small and great, opened the hand of rejoicing, and beat the feet of delight in that feast of fortune, and secured endless favours. An account of this sublime feast, which was the celestial \u2018\u012ad and the world\u2019s New Year, and of the arrival of the honoured cradle of his Majesty, the king of kings, at his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s sublime camp, and of other occurrences which are the adorning frontispiece of this auspicious rescript and the illuminated border of this mandate of fortune, has been incorporated in the beginning of this lofty-titled volume; for this real Pinacothek, wherein are depicted the wondrous events, noble deeds and glorious victories of his Majesty, the king of kings, is fashioned in accord with the initiative of the exaltation-point (sharaf) of the holy nativity, and whatever else has been traced by the pen of supplication is but ancillary to this and but a diluent or vehicle of the\n\n---\n\n1 Gul-sam\u012bn. Perhaps Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b\u2019s bosom is meant.\n\n2 Arlang or Arhang, the house of the painter M\u0101n\u012b and also his album. D\u2019Herbelot s. v. Ertenk & Jarrett III. 336, 337. M\u0101n\u012b is the supposed founder of Manicheism.\n\n3 Sir\u0101b-i-sulh\u0101n, lit. irrigation of words. A. F. here explains why he began his work with the horoscopes of Akbar and the details of his birth although this causes some repetition in his account of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s reign. It may be worth while noting that A. F. divided his history according to garans or periods of thirty years, of his hero\u2019s life. Thus his first volume embraced the first thirty years of Akbar\u2019s life, viz., from his birth to the end of the seventeenth year of his reign, for Akbar ascended the throne when he was 13. The next book was to contain the history of the reign up to the end of the 47th year, but was not completed because A. F. was killed in that year. Apparently he had carried on the history till the end of the 46th year. His hope, as he tells us in the \u0100f\u012bn, Jarrett III. 416, was that he might write four volumes, i.e., the history of four\ndiscourse, and has a real connection with that subject. God be praised! The imposing record of this ever-during progression has been accomplished even from Adam, down to this period (Akbar's birth), generation after generation. That it may go on, the veil is being withdrawn from the countenance of narration.\n\nIn short, as his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-ashy\u0101n\u012b was a world of urbanity and generosity, he had stayed his desire of retirement for the sake of his loyal companions, and with his far-seeing eyes had set about the ordering of the world of interdependencies, as is the special purpose of the existence of princes, and had proceeded towards M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d's country. M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d that ravening demon (d\u0113v-ma\u0101l-i-dad-sirat) did not comprehend the magnitude of the blessing\u2014such as he could not see even in a dream, and behaved in an unworthy manner. Of necessity and at the request of his devoted followers, his Majesty proceeded back to Sind on the chance that the rulers of that country might awake from the slumber of negligence, and amend the past. Though the world-adorning mind did not approve of this, still in accordance with fate he agreed to return. When the sublime army came near the boundary, it became known that the Argh\u016bni\u0101ns were assembled in J\u016bn and were prepared to fight. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b sent forward Shaikh \u2018Ali Beg Jal\u0101r, whose ancestors were of hereditary devotion and loyalty from the time of the uprearing of the standards of glory of his Majesty \u0160\u0101h\u012bb-qir\u0101n\u012b (Tim\u016br), together with a body of brave men. He himself followed. As Shaikh \u2018Ali had at his back the victorious\n\ngarans (120 years). The third volume which he refers to in the passage mentioned above is the \u0100in, which was finished, in a manner, in the 42nd year, i.e., 1597-98. No doubt, however, he intended to add to it from time to time according as new regulations were issued by Akbar, and new territories added to his kingdom. The \u0100in is generally called the third book of the Akbar-n\u0101ma, but it should be remembered that it is not a continuation of the first two, and that it was completed (in a manner) before the historical part of his work was finished. It is in reality an excursus or side-piece to his history. A. F.'s division of his work has not been preserved in the Bib. Ind. edition which is in three volumes, the first ending with Akbar's accession and not with his 17th year as A. F. designed. The expression sir\u0101bt-i-sukhan above referred to is used again by A. F. at p. 195 of text when he digresses into accounts of Sher Kh\u0101n, Haidar Mirz\u0101 and others.\narmy, he went forward bravely with a few men and soon scattered the foe. The breeze of victory's morn blew from the orient of the sword and the horizon of the bow, and the sun of fortune burnt up the darkness of that field of nemesis. The army encamped near J\u016bn.\\(^1\\) To that town of lofty threshold (qa\u1e63ba-i-rafi\u02bf-\u02bfat\u0101ba) there came from Amarkot, the birth-place, the honourable litter of her Majesty Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b and the sublime cradle of his Majesty, the king of kings, attended by fortune and happy augury. Accordingly a detail of the circumstance has been made an adornment to the Introduction. As this spot was on the banks of the Indus and was eminent among the cities of Sind for its many gardens, streams, pleasant fruits and amenities, the army stayed there for some time. There were continual fights with the Arghun\u0101ns who were always defeated. Shaikh T\u0101ju-d-din L\u0101r\u012b,\\(^2\\) who was one of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b's favourites, became a martyr here.\\(^3\\) One day Shaikh \u2018Al\u012b Beg Jal\u0101ir, Tardi Beg Kh\u0101n, and a body of men were despatched to attack the neighbouring district. Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25m\u016bd of Bhakkar and a large number of people fell upon them. Tardi B\u0113g was remiss in fighting, but Sher \u2018Al\u012b B\u0113g stood firm and in that battlefield (razm) which is the banquet-table (bis\u0101t-i-bazm) of the brave, quaffed with unaltered mien the sherbet of martyrdom. The heart of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was grievously wounded by the fate of so faithful a follower, and some other untoward circumstances having occurred, his heart cooled towards the country of Bhakkar and he determined to go to Qandah\u0101r. Just then, on 7th Mu\u1e25arram 950 (13th April, 1543) Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n arrived alone from Gujrat and laid a balm on the wounded spirit of his Majesty, and was a cause of cheerfulness and joy. One of the wonderful things was that as\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) As Stewart remarks, J\u016bn is not marked on the maps. A. F. puts it in H\u0101jk\u0101n. Jarrett II. 340. Apparently it was on the east bank, between Tattah and Sehw\u0101n. General Haig, (l.c., p. 92) says \"J\u016bn, the chief town of a fertile and populous district, was situated on the left bank of the R\u0101n. It is 75 miles southwest of Umarkote and 50 miles north-east of Tattah.\" A note adds that the ruins of J\u016bn are to be seen two miles south-east of the present Tando Ghul\u0101m \u1e24aidar.\n\n\\(^2\\) L\u0101r or L\u0101rist\u0101n is a maritime province of Persia. D'Herbelot s. v. L\u0101r.\n\n\\(^3\\) Perhaps all that is meant is that he died a natural death.\nhe was coming to the camp, he had first to pass over a battle-field. Before he could make his obeisance or reveal himself, he had to prepare for war and to fight bravely. The victorious soldiers were amazed, and thought \"he comes from the secret army (of God).\" When it transpired that he was Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, a shout was raised by those standing in battle-array, and the heart of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b rejoiced. On account of this arrival, they continued for some days to halt in that land of roses (gulzamin).\n\nAccount of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n.\n\nThe brief account of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n is as follows. After exposing his life in the unfortunate affair of Qanauj, he went to Sambal. There he took refuge with R\u0101ja Mitter Sen, one of the great landholders of that country, in the town of Lakhn\u016br and for a while remained there under protection. When Sher Kh\u0101n heard of this, he sent a messenger for him, and the R\u0101ja being helpless, sent the Kh\u0101n. They met on the road to M\u0101lwa. At the beginning of the interview, Sher Kh\u0101n rose up to receive him and in order to attract him, spoke crafty words to him. Among his remarks was this, \"Whoever keeps his loyalty, stumbleth not.\" \"Yea,\" replied Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, \"whoever keeps his loyalty, shall not stumble.\" He contrived, after a thousand difficulties, to escape from near Burh\u0101np\u016br in company with Ab\u016b'l-q\u0101sim, the governor of Gw\u0101liy\u0101r, and set out for Gujr\u0101t. While they were on their way, Sher Kh\u0101n's ambassador who was coming from Gujr\u0101t, got information about them and sent people who arrested Ab\u016b'l-q\u0101sim,\u2014who was remarkable for the beauty of his person. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n out of nobleness and generosity stoutly asseverated that he was Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, while Ab\u016b'l-q\u0101sim heroically said, \"This is my servant; he would sacrifice himself for me, beware and withdraw your hand from him.\" Thus it was the case of\n\n1 Three months according to A. F.'s own chronology, for they did not leave J\u0101n till 11th July. It is more probable that it was Bair\u0101m's arrival and energy which made Hum\u0101y\u016bn take such a decided step as that of leaving Sind.\n\n2 Jarrett II. 298. There is a fuller account of Bair\u0101m's visit to Sambhal in 'Abb\u0101s' chronicle.\n\n3 At Ujjain, according to the chronicle of Sher Sh\u0101h.\nVerse.\n\n\"Leave me, seize the hand of my friend.\"\n\nIn this way Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n escaped and went to Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd in Gujrat. Ab\u016b'l-q\u0101sim was taken before Sher Kh\u0101n, and from failure to appreciate him, that mine of magnanimity was martyred. Sher Kh\u0101n used frequently to remark that \"as soon as Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n said in the assembly 'Whoever keeps his loyalty shall not stumble,' we gathered that he would not come to terms with us.\" Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd of Gujrat too, though he tried to induce him to stay with him, could not succeed. He (Bair\u0101m) got leave to go on pilgrimage and came to S\u016brat. Thence he hurried off to the country of Hardw\u0101r.\n\n1 Gulist\u0101n V. 20.\n2 As n\u0101-ehin\u0101si; this cannot mean, owing to his not being recognised, for Sher Kh\u0101n had seen the real Bair\u0101m.\n3 I adopt the variant na khw\u0101had.\n4 Corrected in the Errata to M\u0101rw\u0101r, but apparently on the authority of one MS. only and I suspect that M\u0101rw\u0101r is merely a guess devised to get rid of the improbability of Bair\u0101m's having gone to such a distant place as Hardw\u0101r. The Ma'\u0101\u1e63ir-i-umara has Hardw\u0101rand so has the Ma'\u0101\u1e63ir-i-ra\u1e25\u012bmi. It does not agree very well with A. F.'s statement that Bair\u0101m joined Hum\u0101y\u016bn from Gujrat, but then neither does M\u0101rw\u0101r. Though Hardw\u0101r be very far it is not impossible that Bair\u0101m who was trying to hide, went the distance in order to escape Sher Kh\u0101n and Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd. He may have done so in disguise and in company with Hind\u016b pilgrims. Possibly too he went there because it was not far from his old refuge of Sambhal. At first I was inclined to accept M\u0101rw\u0101r and to suppose that A. F. wrote it in the form Mar\u016bwar or Mar\u016bwar (\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0631) which according to Tod, is the original word and which might easily enough be read by a copyist as Hardw\u0101r. It might also have been supposed that Bair\u0101m went to M\u0101rw\u0101r, i.e., Jodhpur, in pursuit of Hum\u0101y\u016bn of whose expedition into M\u0101ld\u0113o's country he may have heard. A pencil note in Chalmers' Ms. suggests Dw\u0101rk\u0101 (in Gujrat) which would do very well if we had any evidence that Dw\u0101rk\u0101 was ever called Hardw\u0101r. On the whole I think that we must hold that A. F. wrote Hardw\u0101r. The Ma'\u0101\u1e63ir-i-ra\u1e25\u012bmi has a biography of Bair\u0101m taken apparently from a work called the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-akbari by Mu\u1e25ammad '\u0100rif Qandah\u0101r\u012b who had been Bair\u0101m's steward. It uses the word Hardw\u0101r twice apparently without any suspicion of mistake. It describes Bair\u0101m's parentage, his birth in Qil'a Zafar in Badakhsh\u0101n, the death of his father, Saif 'Al\u012b at Ghazn\u012bn, his entering Hum\u0101y\u016bn's service, and becoming his muhrdar (chancellor), and finally, with refer-\nand from there he came to the feet of his own master (\u015fahib) and the benefactor of mankind in the village of J\u00fcn.\n\nence perhaps to A. F.'s remarks on the thousand difficulties which Bair\u00e4m experienced in making his escape to Gujr\u00e4t,\u2014it tells us how he in the course of his wanderings, fell in with a party of G\u00fbw\u00e4r\u0101s who were drinking and dancing, and how they constrained him to take part in their merry-making.\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nSingular Manifestation by His Majesty, the King of Kings, in the Eighth Month from His Nativity's Exaltation-Point (Sharaf), Being the Illuminated Border of Miracles (Kar\u0101mat), and Presage of His Career (Maq\u0101mat, lit. stages or stations).\n\nIn the pages of Divine knowledge, which are \"the guarded tablets\" from and for eternity, it is laid down that when the diadem of distinction is set on the marvellous head of a world-adorning creature in the temporal and spiritual enthroning-room, there are emitted, from the auspicious birth-hour of that glorious one, flashings and wonders (baw\u0101riq-i-hal\u0101t-\u016b-khaw\u0101riq-t-\u2018\u0101d\u0101t) from the folded pages of his record, each of them a mysterious herald loudly proclaiming in the reason's ear of mankind the glorious progression of his power, and by such revelations augmenting the felicity of mortals. One of the marvellous proofs of this is that when seven months complete had elapsed from his Majesty, the king of kings', auspicious birth, and when he had in his fortune and felicity entered on the eighth, a strange circumstance occurred. On an evening which was seized of the light of fortune's morn, Jiji Anaga\u2014that cupola of chastity\u2014was nursing the first fruit of the garden of holiness, and grieving over the opposition to her by that veil of chastity\u2014Maham Anaga, and by many others. She was very sad because they had represented to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b that M\u012br Ghaznav\u012b's wife (i.e., herself) was practising incantations so that his Majesty, the prince of mankind, should not accept anyone's milk but her own. At this time, when none else was present, his Majesty, seeing that there was privacy, became vocal, and Messiah-like.\n\n1 Laub-i-mahf\u016bz, Book of Destiny. D'Herbelot s.v. Omm Alkitab, & Lane, 2680c.\n2 Mu\u1e25ammadans believe that Jesus Christ spoke in the cradle.\nopened his wondrous mouth to comfort Jiji Anaga's afflicted heart. \"Be of good cheer,\" he said, \"for the celestial light of the khil\u0101fat shall abide in thy bosom and shall bestow on the night of thy sorrow the effulgence of joy. But see that thou reveal this our secret to no one, and that thou dost not proclaim untimely this mystery of God's power, for hidden designs and great previsions are infolded therein.\" Jiji Anaga declared, \"This life-fraught intimation brought me into rapture, and sorrow's knot was at once loosed from off my heart. This portent which gave me from the eternal throne the sole and undisputed charge of a child of light, expanded my heart, one becoming a hundred and a hundred a thousand.\" Day by day the doors of joy and gladness opened wider and wider before me, and having established myself on thanksgiving for this great blessing, I addressed myself to my duties, heart and soul. The glory and dominion of two worlds were revealed to me. But I kept this mystery sealed up till that nursling of dominion became the thronedarner of the regions of world-conquest. One day he had gone forth from Dihli to hunt in the district of P\u0101lam, and there an enormous and terrific serpent, such as might move the heart of the daring, appeared on the line of road. On this occasion his Majesty exhibited the miracle of Moses, and without the hesitation which comes even to generous hearts, put forth his white hand and approaching the serpent, courageously and in the strength of a sacred intimation, seized its tail with his holy hand and quelled it. Y\u016bsuf Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, brother of M\u012brz\u0101 'Az\u012bz K\u014dkalt\u0101sh beheld this token of power and in his astonishment came and told me. On that occasion I told my dear son that sealed and hidden-away mystery which I myself had seen and heard, and said, 'His Majesty did that wonderful thing in his tender years,' tis not strange\n\n1 Text, Kh\u0101\u1e6dir\u012bk\u012b, but it should be Kh\u0101\u1e6dir y\u0101k\u012b.\n2 Jarrett II. 286. In the Dihli district, and so apparently, different from P\u0101lam in Kangra.\n3 Arba\u02bf\u0101-i-tahawwur. Tahawwur means, according to Lane, a state in which one enters on rash enterprises, such as fighting with unbelievers more than double the number of the Muslim. Dict. 2906c.\n4 An allusion to the Muhammadan story of the white hand of Moses cf. Exodus iv. 6. The miracle of Moses above referred to seems to be the conversion of Moses' rod into a serpent.\n5 Blochmann 323. Son of Jiji Anaga. He was the elder brother.\nif in his maturity he has performed this miracle, for every act hath its time and every speech its season. The reason of my not mentioning this marvel till this point is that no one to whom I told it, would have believed it, but on the contrary would have taxed me with weakness of intellect. The taste of such a story would have been bitter to their wishes' palate. Moreover I was not at liberty to reveal it. Now, my son, that I have heard from you the story of the serpent, I have opened my lips to tell of the mystery which marked his tender years, while the other is a sample of his riper age. My honoured son! in that exhibitor of miracles such indications and stages of development ('al\u0101m\u0101t \u016b maq\u0101m\u0101t) are not surprising.\" Though Ab\u016b'l-fagl, the composer of this noble record had heard these two anecdotes from a person of veracity, yet he also received them direct from that receptacle of chastity (J\u012bj\u012b Anaga). But what the writer has seen with his own eyes and has understood by his own contemplation, concerning the perfections and miracles of this nursling of Divine light, exceeds mortal conjecture and human comprehension. In truth what was recounted by the venerable mother of M. 'Az\u012bz K\u014dka is astonishing to the exoteric (a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b-i-z\u0101hir), but what this humble one hath witnessed is awe-augmenting to the esoteric (arb\u0101b-i-b\u0101\u1e6din).\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nDEPARTURE OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100NI JANNAT-\u0100SHY\u0100N\u012a FOR QANDAH\u0100R, WITH THE DESIGN OF GOING THENCE TO THE HIL\u0100Z AND OF HIS RESOLUTION TO ENTER PERSIA.\n\nIt is the Eternal will and the Divine design that when the glorious robe of a king's fortune is being embroidered with the fringe of perpetuity and the props of his throne of greatness and sovereignty made strong and glorious by the pillars of fixity and permanence, sundry accidents which have the appearance of retrogressions and withdrawals are brought in front of his path. In truth these are apparent and not real, and the impediments are in the end subjects of thanksgiving. The short-sighted regard such as defects and become astonished. But they of uplifted eyes recognise them as the mole on Fortune's cheek, and regard them as a note of the subjugation of the evil eye. The fortunate man regards every evil which comes in his way, as the complement of perfection, while the unfortunate man regards them as his destruction, spiritual and temporal, and collapses into the collar of lamentation. The retrogradations of the planets\u2014the regents of the seven celestial climes\u2014are an illustration of this and typify the design. Though the world-illuminating sun be hid from sight by cloud and vapour, yet in truth 'tis no mighty screen which has been lowered over mortal eyes, nor has any defect reached those glorious halls (the sun's). When it seemeth to be a cause of concealment, the strong blast of Divine power casts the vapour headlong and relegates it to the black earth. The phenomena of sunrise and sunset too are torch-bearing indicators of this. For the status and condition of the Treasury of Light when in the East are identical with his status and condition when under the veil of the West. And the condition which he hath when\n\n1 The sun and moon were recognised as planets, thus making seven in all.\nin the zenith and when in declination from the meridian, is absolutely the same as his condition when in the nadir of mid-night.\\footnote{Watad-i-rub'-i-nigfu-l-lail.} The difference is in the earth-born beholders\\footnote{Khirman. It also means parhelion or halo, and probably A. F. wished to take advantage of this double meaning.} and in the imaginations of the dwellers in a handful of clay. Assuredly the pinacles of his glory is all the holier because the thoughts of detrimental have touched its fringe. In accordance with these propositions, whoever cherisheth evil thoughts against tiara'ed lords of bliss, and diademed lords of fortune, is caught at last by the exemplary punishment of his deeds, and becomes a primefactor of his own destruction. These truths are mirrored in the presage-full history of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b for in brief space was the skirt of his Majesty's fortune, which had been sullied by misfortune, washed and cleansed at the fountain-head of fruition, while all the ingrates received the punishment of their designs and deeds. The stack\\footnote{See Lane's Dict. 650a.} of their lives and fortunes was consumed by the lightning of Divine wrath, and the note of the existence of those wretches was erased from the Book of Time. Accordingly the difficulties (ma\u1e63\u0101'ib) and fatigues (mat\u0101'ib), of adversity ('usr) and the stations (maw\u0101rid) and ascensions (mat\u0101li') of prosperity (yusr) are being set-forth in the order of their time and place.\n\nIn fine, as his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b's holiness-expressing soul had grown aweary of this world's vain show, and had turned away her lofty contemplation from the territory of Sind, it occurred to his sanctified mind to offer peace to the ruler of Tatta and to march to Qandah\u0101r. When the sublime cavalcade should arrive there, he would commit his Majesty, the king of kings, and the elect ones of his Court to God's protection, would plant his own foot on the highway of asceticism and retreat and ascend the steps of ecstasy and rapture and phoenix-like (hum\u0101w\u0101r), pet the pinnacle of love 'neath the wings of genius. As he had gained spiritual abundance by circumambulating the altar of the heart, he would, by conveying the sacred litter (ma\u1e6dmil)\\footnote{See Lane's Dict. 650a.} to the ka'ba of clay at one semblance and substance. As the spiritual pinacothek had been constructed, he would also adorn the visible temple. Thus would\nhearts be conciliated and a method of truthful guidance be furnished to the simple-minded followers of forms.\n\nHe was occupied with these thoughts when the ruler of Tatta on understanding his intention, recognised his own gain therein and despatched a petition for peace. As the soaring falcon of his Majesty\u2019s genius had spread her wings for the chase of the phoenix (\u2018anq\u0101) and had withdrawn her far-seeing gaze from lower game and let it fall on lofty eyries, his petition reached the place of acceptation. The Argh\u016bn\u012b\u0101ns whose affairs were in distress, tossed the cap of joy to the skies on hearing the glad tidings of peace, and regarding the project as the goal of desire and as an unlooked for boon, forwarded a large present and made various apologies.\n\nHis Majesty auspiciously and prosperously left J\u016bn for Qandah\u0101r via Siw\u012b (Sibi) on 7th Rabi\u2019ul-akhir, 950 (11th July, 1543). M. \u2018Askar on hearing of the approach of the royal cavalcade, and acting by M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s orders and from his own wickedness, strengthened the fort (Qandah\u0101r) and proceeded with evil intentions with a large body of troops towards the sublime camp in order that he might by help of villainy take his Majesty prisoner. Meanwhile Amir All\u0101h D\u014dst, one of the learned of the age and who had on several occasions acted as M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s Agent (vakil) and Shaikh \u2018Abdu-l Wahh\u0101b were coming to solicit, in marriage on M\u012brz\u0101 K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s behalf, the daughter of Sh\u0101h Husain Beg Argh\u016bn. On hearing of the approach of the sublime army, they took refuge in the castle of Siw\u012b. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b sent an exalted mandate to M\u012br All\u0101h D\u014dst, summoning him to his presence, but he out of worthlessness, chose exclusion from the honour\n\n---\n\n1 Sh\u0101h Husain on the principle of making a golden bridge for a flying enemy, sent Hum\u0101y\u016bn 30 boats and 300 camels.

He was descended from Ab\u016b Sa\u2019d P\u016br\u0101n\u012b, and was of an Arabian family, settled in Sind. He was a distinguished lawyer and perhaps A.

But more probably the reference is to a descendant of his, Shaikh Mirak P\u016br\u0101n\u012b who was Shaikh-i-isl\u0101m of Tatta. See T\u0101r. Sind.\nof service and made the excuse that the garrison would not let him leave.\n\nWhen the army came to the territory of Sh\u0101l, which is about 30 farsakh (150 miles) from Qandah\u0101r, Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Beg, an officer of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and who had a fief in the territory, had left people to capture any scouts and by them two of the royal servants who had gone on in advance to Sar-c\u0101shma were arrested and brought in. One of them managed to escape from their clutches and came and reported what he had learnt of their evil designs by observing their ways and language. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, on perceiving the ingratitude of this crew, gave up the idea of proceeding to Qandah\u0101r, and turned off towards Mashtang; P\u0101yanda Muhammad Waisi took leave and went to Qandah\u0101r. With him was sent an autograph letter to M. \u2018Askari, strong in expressions such as might appeal to a little-loving, disloyal brother, and containing warnings and instructions. But where was the reason-harkening ear, and where the heart of right understanding? Treating these remonstrances as unheard, he continued to go on in his villainy. Q\u0101sim Husain Sult\u0101n, Mahdi Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n and many others of \u2018Askari Mirz\u0101\u2019s servants remonstrated against his going lest his Majesty should grow desperate, and out of dire necessity proceed to Persia, and less great calamities should occur. Ab\u016b\u2019l-khair and a number of wicked men uttered flattering, house-subverting words, outwardly specious but inwardly productive of evil and ruin, and confirmed him in his faulty resolves.

Mashtang or Mastang lies about 30 miles, S. S. W. of Quettah and is between it and Khil\u0101t.

When he had advanced one or two kos, he asked his servants, if any of them had been that way. Jai Bah\u0101dur \u016azbak, who was Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sult\u0101n's servant and had on this expedition taken service with the Mirz\u0101, said, \"I know this road thoroughly, and have repeatedly gone and come by it!\" The Mirz\u0101 replied that he was speaking the truth for he had been a jagird\u0101r there, and he bade him go on ahead and lead the way. He objected that his pony was knocked up, and the Mirz\u0101 signed to Tars\u016bn Barl\u0101s, one of his servants, to give him his horse. He objected about his own necessities but had to surrender the animal.\n\nJai Bah\u0101dur, who had served the king in India, advanced a little by auspicious guidance and then putting his horse to the gallop, went off to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n's tent, and unfolded the facts of the case. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n went with him to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, whom he informed of the evil intentions of that ingrate (\"Askar\u012b\"). His Majesty sent to Tardi Beg and some others for horses. Those base, narrow-eyed men turned away from the perception of their good fortune (in thus having an opportunity of serving Hum\u0101y\u016bn) and refused to give them. His Majesty wished to mount his horse (perhaps Jai Bah\u0101dur's) and go and give them a lesson. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n deprecated doing this, as the moment was critical and there was no time for dallying. \"Let the ingrates be left to God's vengeance, and let his Majesty follow his own course.\" On hearing this representation his Majesty, attended by a few devoted followers, took the road of the desert. He gave up the idea of Qandah\u0101r and K\u0101bul and proceeded towards Persia (\"Ir\u0101q\") with the intention of going to the \u1e24ij\u0101z (Mecca, &c.), and as a desert-traverser, entered on the path of separation (\"fir\u0101q\").\n\nKhw\u0101ja Mu'azzam, Nad\u012bm Kokalt\u0101gh, Mir Ghaznavi, and Khw\u0101ja 'Ambar Naz\u012br were directed that his Majesty, the king of kings, was in the cradle of guardianship and under the protection of the\n\n---\n\n1 A.

Those right-minded ones made haste and performed acceptable service. After going a little way, night came on darker than the hearts of unacknowledging ingrates. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n represented that his Majesty was aware of M\u012brz\u0101 'Askari's lust for gold and property; that at this time the M\u012brz\u0101 would be secure and at ease, and be sitting in a tent with two or three clerks, and looking at the list of the goods and chattels in his Majesty's camp. The proper thing for them was to rely upon the Divine favour, and to come suddenly on that tent, and settle his business. That though the M\u012brz\u0101 had become alienated, all his servants had been brought up on his Majesty's salt, and that they would inevitably come forward and serve him. His Majesty approved of this proposal from the practical point of view, but out of his pure nature and well-meaningness he declined to adopt it, and said they had now set out for a foreign land and had entered on a long journey, and that he would not give up his plans. Once more he committed his Majesty, the king of kings, to the protection of the God of Glory, the repeller (d\u0101f\u012b') of evils, and supporter (r\u0101fi') in dangers, and taking the eternal counsels as his guide and the everlasting favour as his helper in place and out of place, he fixed the saddle of dominion on the steed of enterprise, and the foot of forward-faring in the stirrup of trust and proceeded on his way.\n\nWhen M\u012brz\u0101 'Askari with his evil intentions approached Mashtang he sent on his sadr Mir Ab\u016b'l-hasan that he might go to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, and that if the latter was meditating departure, he might by trick and stratagem detain him. The Mir arrived just when his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was mounting his horse, and sought to turn him by alleging sundry messages from the M\u012brz\u0101. His Majesty, by God's guidance, did not listen to his vain words, but rapidly went off. M. 'Askari came up afterwards and sent Sh\u0101h Walad, Ab\u016b'l-khair and many others of his men to guard the camp and not let any one go out of it. He heard from the Sadr Mir Ab\u016b'l-husain\n\n---\n\n1 The meaning is that Hum\u0101y\u016bn had begun his pilgrimage to Mecca and so would not turn back.\nthe story of Jai Bah\u0101dur's warning and of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni's departure. Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n and the other faithless servants came and paid their respects to the Mirz\u0101 who made them all over to trusty men of his own.\n\nA short-sighted man, who does not reflect on the evil day or on a bad end and who enters on the path of wicked designs and of shamelessness, in reality strikes an axe into the foot of his own well-being, and prepares for himself misfortunes and heaven-sent adversities. These things are not hidden from the readers of the pages of the world's history! When Mir Ghaznavi came and paid his respects to M. 'Askari, the latter said, \"We came to do homage to the king, therefore has his Excellency gone off by the desert?\" Then he inquired where the Prince was, meaning his Majesty, the king of kings. Mir Ghaznavi said he was in his quarters. The Mirz\u0101 said \"Good, let a camel-load of fruit be taken to him from the commissariat (vik\u0101bkh\u0101na); I am coming too.\" At night he and one or two clerks examined in his tent some of the things which had been brought from the royal stores (sark\u0101r); they wrote them down and the state of affairs was exactly as Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n had conjectured and had represented. Next day at breakfast time (about 9 A.M.) he had his drums beaten and moved from his quarters to the royal encampment. He slighted at the door of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni's residence (daulatk\u0101h\u0101na) and had all the men, one by one, small and great, arrested. He made over Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n to Sh\u0101h Walad, and he put all the unfaithful servants in charge of his own men and took them off to Qandah\u0101r. Many of them he destroyed by hardships and torments, and from Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n he took all his hoard so that he soon got the retribution of his deeds. But no, no! how could this be retribution for such crimes? if we called this typhoon of evils one revolution (gird\u012b) in the descending of retribution, it would still not be appropriate.\n\n1 Jah\u0101r, who remained in the camp, describes how disappointed 'Askari was to find that a heavy chest contained only stones.\n\n2 Cf. text I. 63, l. 5 where the same word gird\u012b is used. But several MSS. have nas\u016bl instead of nas\u016bl as if the phrase was\n\nan atom (gird\u012b) out of the abundance. Typhoon, \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n, means etymologically a turning or revolving (cf. whirlwind) and hence is appropriately used here.\n\n3 Tard\u012b Beg was eventually put to death by B\u0101'\u012bn Kh\u0101n.\nVerse.\n\nIf a wicked and ill-fated man\nBecome good by a teacher's instruction,\nIn the end the mystery is explained\nFor then his true nature is revealed.\n\nIt is clear to those who can discern the mysteries of fate, that when the fortunate hand of an eternally elected one be decked with sovereignty's signet, and the dominion-head be exalted by the khilafat's diadem, the rays of glory are ever shining on the forehead of his career. One of the wondrous indications and celestial portents which occurred at this time in relation to his Majesty, the king of kings, was as follows. When Mirz\u0101 'Askar\u012b came to the royal camp and began his improprieties, Mir Ghaznav\u012b and M\u0101ham \u0100gh\u0101 brought his Majesty the king of kings before him on the shoulder of honour and in the bosom of security. Though the Mirz\u0101 directed his countenance towards him and had a jubilant air and wore a forced smile, his Majesty, even then an aggregate of the perfections of a mature man of the world, spite of his tender years, was in no way elated (shigufia). Restraint of spirit was manifested on his brow. The Mirz\u0101 changed his tone and said, \"We\n\n1 The text has in the first line kunad instead of kunish and consequently is unintelligible. Most of the I. O. MSS. have kunish and I think this is unquestionably the right reading. The meaning is that the coltish nature will break through some day, or as B\u0101b\u0101r expresses it, that everything returns to its original. It corresponds to the Horatian maxim about nature's returning even if expelled by a pitchfork.\n\n2 So in text instead of the Anaga sometimes used. Probably \u0100gh\u0101 is right for it is also a term applied to a woman.\n\n3 Dar maq\u0101m-i-shigufiag\u012b n zahr-khand amud. Zahr-khand is said by the Bah\u0101r-i-'ajam to be the opposite of shukr-khand. It means smiling or laughter out of anger or recklessness, lit. a poison-smile. A sardonic smile perhaps expresses the meaning.\n\n4 Qabz-i-kh\u0101tir, repression or depression of spirit; \u0642\u0628\u0636 \u0648 \u0628\u064f\u0639\u062f, says Lane 2482b, are terms applied by the investigators of truth among the Sufis, to two contrary states of the heart, from both of which it is seldom or never free; the former being an affection of the heart withholding it from dilatation and joys. See also Dict. T. T. II. 1198. There A. F. uses it in opposition to shigufiag\u012b which literally means expansion.\n\n5 Tar\u012bq shuda. This term is explained by the Bah\u0101r-i-'ajam to mean\ncan see whose this child is. Why should he be elated at seeing us?\u2019\n\nThe Mirz\u0101\u2019s ring was hanging from his neck by a red ribbon and after a little while the child in accordance with infantive ways\u2014no! no! by Fortune\u2019s guiding hand, put his hand to the ribbon and sought to take it. The Mirz\u0101 immediately took the ribbon from his neck and gave it to his Majesty, the king of kings. The acute in the assembly saw in this an auspicious prognostic that bye-and-bye the seal of dominion and the ring of sovereignty would bear his Majesty\u2019s name, and that water flowing from the fount of Divine bounties would become a river. From thence his Majesty the Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h went, protected by the Divine aid, in company with M. \u2018Askar\u012b towards Qandah\u0101r. Standing and sitting, sleeping and waking, rays of greatness and command streamed from his Majesty\u2019s forehead, and the lights of God\u2019s knowledge were manifested. On the road K\u014dk\u012b Bah\u0101dur, one of M. \u2018Askar\u012b\u2019s confidants, came near his Majesty\u2019s (Akbar) camel litter and said to Mir Ghaznavi that if he made the prince over to him he would take him to the king. The Mir replied that as the king himself had not taken him, \u2019twas evident there was a reason for leaving him; nor could he venture without high authority to take action. Bah\u0101dur said, \u201cI\u2019ve formed the desire to serve his Majesty and hence I come at such a time of desolation to do so. I wanted to perform this service and now that you don\u2019t exalt me by this blessing, give me a token from his Majesty, the king of kings (Akbar), that I may give it to his Majesty.\u201d Mir Ghaznavi gave to Bah\u0101dur his Majesty\u2019s cap,1 the diadem of the moon of auspiciousness, and thereby exalted him.\n\nM. \u2018Askar\u012b brought his Majesty, the king of kings, to Qandah\u0101r on 18th Ramaz\u0101n, 950 (16th December, 1543), and assigned him a residence in the citadel near himself. Mah\u0101m \u0100gh\u0101, J\u012bj\u012b Anaga and Atka Kh\u0101n were made eternally fortunate by serving him, and longed for the diffusion of the light of holiness. The Mirz\u0101 made over this nursling of fortune who was growing up in the shadow of the\n\n---\n\n1. The t\u0101q\u012bya is properly the skull-cap worn under the turban, but perhaps this was all the child was wearing. It is very ridiculous that A. F. makes Bah\u0101dur speak of the infant as his Majesty Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h, a title not invented for him till long afterwards.\nDivine protection, to his own wife Sult\u0101n Begam, and that cupola of chastity out of her abundant wisdom, lovingly and devotedly tended him. To appearance she watched over him, but in reality she was keeping herself alongside of light absolute, and so receiving illumination, and day by day she was beholding more and more the glory (farr) of greatness proceeding from the light-increasing brows of that world-blessing.\n\nEvil thoughts respecting one who is God-supported and in whose person God-nourished light exists, can only terminate in good, and out of contrariety nothing can come except service and benefit. Accordingly Eternal Providence was tending him at that time when paternal affection and maternal love should have been responsible for his needments (takaff\u016bl-i-muhimm\u0101t) and he was in the hands of deadly enemies, so that the foot of loyalty of the far-sighted of wisdom\u2019s kingdom might be the more established, and that a guiding lamp might come into the hands of the short-sighted and simple, and that the facts of the Divine watchfulness and of heavenly guardianship might be manifest to friend and foe. I have heard from the sacred lips of his Majesty, the king of kings, as follows: \u201cI perfectly remember what happened when I was one year old, and especially the time when his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b proceeded towards \u1e6cr\u0101q and I was brought to Qandah\u0101r. I was then one year and three months old. One day M\u0101ham Anaga, the mother of Adham Kh\u0101n, (who was always in charge of that nursling of fortune), represented to M. \u2018Askari, \u201cIt is a T\u00fcrki custom that when a child begins to walk, the father or grandfather or whoever represents them, takes off his turban and strikes the child with it, as he is going along, so that the nursling of hope may come to the ground (i.e., may fall down). At present his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b is not here; you are in his room, and it is fitting you should perform this spell which is\n\n1 This lady went, after her husband\u2019s death, to Mecca in company with Gulbadan Begam and others in 1574.\n2 Fourteen months, vis., from 15th October, 1542, to 16th December, 1543, or 144 Mu\u1e25ammadan months.\n3 Text, rasmi-busurg\u0101n, ancestral custom, but I. V. MS. A. 584, and 3308 and 3330 have Turk\u0101n, and this is most likely to be correct.

The Mirz\u0101 immediately took off his turban and flung it at me, and I fell down.\u201d \u201cThis striking and falling,\u201d his Majesty deigned to observe, \u201care visibly before me. Also at the same time they took me for good luck to have my head shaved at the shrine of B\u0101b\u0101 \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l. That journey and the taking off my hair are present before me as in a mirror.\u201d\n\nWhat is there extraordinary about this or a hundred things like it, to any one in the blissful chambers of whose heart there is an enkindled lamp?\n\nAs the thread of the narrative has extended so far, it is unavoidable that for the moistening of discourse (*sir\u0101bi-i-sukhan*), I say something about the remaining events of Sher Kh\u0101n, about Mirz\u0101 Haidar\u2019s going to Kashmir, about the condition of M. Kamr\u0101n who went to K\u0101bul, and M. Hind\u0101l who hurried off to Qandah\u0101r, and Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 who made opposition and remained in Bhakkar, o that the searcher after instruction may take warning, and by the strength of a happy fortune, spend his days prudently and righteously.\n\n---\n\n1 Apparently *sipand* is not wild rue, but *mehnd\u012b*, i.e., *Lawsonia inermis*, which yields henna.\n\n2 Probably what was cut off was a *c\u016bnti*, or tuft. See Herbelot, pp. 21 and 180.\n\n3 There is a famous shrine of \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l in the Attock tahsil of the R\u0101wal Pindi district. See Murray\u2019s Hand-book for the Panj\u0101b 268, the *Tusak-i-jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b* 48 and Blochmann 575. Jah\u0101ng\u012br says that Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Atk\u0101 made a reservoir at \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l, and as he was Akbar\u2019s guardian and foster-father, it is possible that it was to this \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l that the child was taken. But the shrine is a long way off from Qandah\u0101r and it is doubtful if \u2018Askar\u012b would have allowed Akbar to be removed so far. There is a shrine called B\u0101b\u0101 Wali, and also \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l, in the outskirts of Qandah\u0101r (to the westward). It is mentioned infra text I. 238, eight lines from foot, and it is probably to this place that Akbar was taken.\n\nI may note that there is a long account of the saint \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l in the *Tar. Sind*. M\u0101\u2019\u1e63\u016bm was a descendant of his, the saint\u2019s original home being Sabzw\u0101r in Persia.\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nBRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE EVIL-ENDING CAREER OF SH\u012aR KH\u0100N.\n\nIt is known that Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n after crossing the B\u012b\u0101h (Beas) advanced slowly, and in spite of all his warlike equipment acted with great circumspection. He was greatly afraid lest the heroes of the royal army should coalesce and advancing into the field of warfare should exact vengeance from him and bring to nothing all his treacherous machinations. He had sent a large force ahead, but was very cautious about engaging. After some days, when the defection of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, and the opposition of the other brothers became known far and wide, he came to L\u0101h\u014dr. From thence he advanced as far as Khush\u0101b, and was for some days in Bh\u0113ra and its neighbourhood. He sent a summons to Sult\u0101n S\u0101rang Ghakkar and Sult\u0101n \u0100dam who were leading landholders in that neighbourhood, but as they had been clients of his Majesty G\u016bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bsmak\u0101n\u012b, and had prospered by the favour of that exalted family they did not listen to his overtures. He advanced to Hath\u012b\u0101p\u016br in the Ghakkar territory and sent a large force against them. The Ghakkars fought bravely and defeated the Afghans so that many of them were captured and sold. Sh\u012br Kh\u0101n wished to march against them in person. He consulted his followers and they advised that as this tribe had strong mountains and remote (zaminh\u0101-i-qalb, heart, i.e., internal) territories, they should be dealt with by degrees and by\n\n1 This and the two following headings do not occur in several MSS.\n2 Jarrett II, 323.

The proper course was to leave a large army in that neighbourhood which could both watch the royal army and also devastate the country of the Ghakkars. It was also desirable that a strong fort should be built for the carrying out of these two objects. Thus by a counter move these men would be impeded by their own impediments (as tangan\u0101\u012b-i-khud batang \u0101mada) and their stubborn heads be brought low. For himself, the proper course was to turn back and apply himself to the administration of the vast country of India. In consequence of this advice he laid the foundations of the Fort of Roht\u0101s\u00b9 and having left a large force there he marched back and came to \u0100gra. From thence he came to Gwalior where M\u012br Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim was sheltering himself, but was obliged by want of provisions to surrender. Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n became supreme, and divided all India, except Bengal, into 47 divisions. He introduced the branding\u00b2 of soldiers\u2019 horses and carried into effect some of the many plans of Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u0101\u2019u-d-d\u012bn which are set forth in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-F\u012br\u016bz-gh\u0101h\u012b,\u00b3 and which he had heard of. After that he proceeded against P\u016bran\u2074 Mal the Raja of Raisin and Candiri. He got the Raja out of the fort by a dishonest treaty and promises and by the efforts of sundry misguided lawyers\u2075 and wretched ignoramuses he destroyed the very men to whom he had given quarter.

F.\u2019s indignation is very creditable to him and he is apparently the only writer who expresses it, N\u012bz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, Bad\u0101oni and Forights tell the story without censure, and \u2018Abb\u0101s Kh\u0101n seems to exult in it. Elliot IV, 402. But A. F. draws a veil over the fact, mentioned by the other historians, that the leading instigator or ratifier of Sh\u0113r Sh\u0101h\u2019s shameless breach of faith was a lawyer or rather theologian named Raftu-d-d\u012bn Safav\u012b of whose wisdom and learning A. F. speaks so highly in Chapter XXVI and in Jarrett, III. 423. Probably the reason for this reticence was that A. F.\u2019s mother was the daughter or other near descendant of Raft-ud-d\u012bn. See Jarrett l. c. The reason the lawyers gave for the breach of the safe-conduct was that P\u016bran Mal had Muhammadan women in his harem and had even made some of\n\u0100gra and after the manner of the governors\u00b9 (\u1e25ukk\u0101m) of Bengal established serais on the roads at the distance of every kos.\n\nAfter a dangerous illness in \u0100gra\u00b2 he marched against M\u0101ld\u0113\u014d the lord of Ajmir, N\u0101gor and many other cities. When he had by fraud and guile\u00b3 disposed of that territory he hastened to Cit\u016br and Ranthanb\u016br. There too he practised his juggleries so that the custodians of the forts sent him the keys. Having got rid of everything there he entered the territory of Dhund\u012bra.\u2074 From there he went to the fort of K\u0101linjar and laying siege to it, he made covered approaches (s\u0101b\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101) and drove mines against it.

It is to the effect that on account of the breach of faith Qutb Kh\u0101n left Sh\u0113r Sh\u0101h\u2019s service and became a hermit. It is not clear who this Qutb Kh\u0101n was, but he could not have been Sh\u0113r Sh\u0101h\u2019s son for he had been shortly before killed in battle. \u2018Abb\u0101s Kh\u0101n, Elliott, l. c. calls him Qutb Kh\u0101n N\u0101bit and says, as also does Bad\u0101oni, that he was one of the negotiators of the treaty. The word which I have translated ignoramuses is safi\u1e6d\u0101n. Could A. F. possibly mean to pun on Rafi\u016b-d-din\u2019s title of \u1e62afav\u012b?

See Tod\u2019s Rajasthan.\n\u2075 This month and day are wrong. The date given by Ferghata and Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n is 12 Rab\u012b\u02bf-u-l-awwal. A. F. says Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n reigned 5 years, 2 months, 13 days, which does not agree with the date 10th Mu\u1e25arram. Sh\u0113r Sh\u0101h is said to have assumed the title and to have struck coins after the battle of Qanauj. This occurred in the beginning of 947, 10th Mu\u1e25arram, whence perhaps A. F.\u2019s date 10th Mu\u1e25arram 952, in order to make it an anniversary and point a moral. If we reckon that he ruled five years, viz., 947\u201351 and died 12 Rab\u012b\u02bf-ul-awwal we get the figures 5 2 12 or almost exactly A. F.\u2019s. Indeed if he did not die till after sunset the 13 is right. A. F. refers to Sh\u0113r Sh\u0101h\u2019s death in the \u0100\u02be\u012bn, Jarrett II, 159, 160. As pointed out by Erskine, A. F. later on, p. 336 of text gives another date for the death, viz., 11 Rab\u012b\u02bf-ul-awwal.\n952, or 5th March, 1545, he was consumed by flames of fire which had spontaneously arisen out of the smoke-sighs\\(^1\\) of the oppressed.

Haidar is as follows:\u2014When he had got assistance from his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, he proceeded towards Kashmir, as already related. When he got to Naushahr,\u00b9 the officers whose names have already been given, loyally came forward and did homage, and again showed him how he could enter Kashmir and take possession of it. The Mirz\u0101 advanced by the passes in reliance on the Divine aid and the royal fortune. Meanwhile a schism occurred in the Emperor\u2019s army. As has been already stated, Khw\u0101ja Kil\u0101n Beg either from his own inclination or at the instance of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, abandoned the enterprise and joined M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, while Mu\u1e93affar T\u016bpc\u012b\u00b2 went off to the S\u0101rang\u00b3 hills. None remained with M. Haidar save a few old servants and the troops whom his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had deputed to his assistance. But as there was much strife and dissension and confusion and anarchy in Kashmir, he was warmly supported by the eagerness of the Kashmiris, and on 22nd Rajab, 947 (22nd November, 1540), he entered by the pass of P\u016bnc\u2074 and conquered Kashmir without a battle or a struggle. For at that time it had been long without an established ruler, and the ministers tyrannously held the country in their own possession, and while giving to one of the claimants the name of monarch, themselves exercised the authority. At that period a person called N\u0101zuk Sh\u0101h\u2014having a name that was no name\u2075 was the\n\n\u00b9 T\u0101r. Rash. 483. Naushahr is in Kashmir and W. N. W. of Jamm\u016b.

Under such circumstances in whatever direction there might not be union, or plan, or counsel, or judgment, to that quarter did the affairs of the country drift. It was the winter-quadragesima\\(^1\\) and there was heavy snow. When K\u0101c\u012b Cak saw\\(^2\\) that M. Haidar was disposed to make himself independent, he, using the craft and perfidy which are indispensable to Kashmiris, left Kashmir and went before Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n. For his object in bringing in M. Haidar was his own aggrandisement and when that was not achieved, but when on the contrary things assumed a different shape, he withdrew his hand and entered on another scheme. He now tried another course and gave Sh\u0113r Kh\u0101n the sister of Isma\u02bfil, the son of Mu\u1e25ammad Shah.\\(^3\\) When he had made himself acceptable by this means he took \u2018Al\u0101wal Kh\u0101n,\\(^4\\) Hasan Kh\u0101n Sarw\u0101n\u012b and others to the number of 2,000 men and came to Kashmir. Meanwhile Abd\u0101l M\u0101kr\u012b, who was his backer, died of dropsy, and M. Haidar having left his family in Andark\u014dt,\\(^5\\) which is a very strong place, was in a protected position. The people of Kashmir all deserted him and but few persons remained with him. He spent three months in the mountain defiles, and then on Monday, 20 Rab\u012b\u02bf-u-s-\u1e63ani, 948 (16th August, 1541), a battle took place, and by God\u2019s help he gained the victory. Though the enemy, consisting partly of Afghan auxiliaries and partly of faithless Kashmiris was more than 5,000 horse, yet as their action was based on faithlessness and disloyalty, it did not succeed and they were defeated. Many of the enemy were slain, and a party of them were made prisoner. Kashmir came absolutely into the possession of the Mirz\u0101, and the Kashmiri preacher (kha\u1e6d\u012bb) Maul\u0101n\u0101 Jam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Y\u016bsuf found the chronogram f\u0101\u1e6dh-i-mukarrar (victory repeated=948).

But towards the end of Shaww\u0101l of that year, (May 1533), he made peace with the Kashmir ministers, and with Muhammad Sh\u0101h who was then the nominal ruler. The Sh\u0101h's daughter was given in marriage for Iskandar Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, the Mirz\u0101's son, and the Mirz\u0101 returned by the way he had entered.\n\nWhen on this (last) occasion a providential victory was gained, and Kashmir was conquered, he for ten years zealously applied himself to its administration and clothed that charming land, but of desolated appearance, with cities and civilization. He sent for artists and craftsmen from all quarters and laboured for its renown and prosperity. Especially was music in brisk demand and varieties of instruments were introduced. In short, the outward condition of that country, that is, its worldly state, acquired solidity. But owing to the Mirz\u0101's frigid and insipid bigotries, the result of imperfect\n\n---\n\n1 T\u0101r. Rash. 423.\n2 T\u0101r. Rash. 423 and Jarrett II. 363. Haidar on that occasion entered Kashmir from Baltist\u0101n, i.e., from the N. E.\n3 Apparently this is not the date of the victory, but of occasion on which the Kashmiris rallied after their defeat, (T\u0101r. Rash. 437-39,) but Haidar is not very explicit. In the \u0100in A. F. wrongly gives the date as 930. Jarrett II, 390.\n4 Iskandar was not Haidar's son, but Sa'id Kh\u0101n's, (T. R.) 341, though Haidar at Sa'id Kh\u0101n's request regarded him as his own. In the \u0100in A. F. correctly calls Sikandar (or Iskandar) the son of Sa'id Kh\u0101n. See also Akbarn\u0101ma III. 552, l. 8. Probably pisar-i-b\u0101d is a copyist's error for pisar-i-b\u0101w\u0101nda, i.e., adopted son.\n5 Hukm-i-khar\u0101ba d\u0101ght. Hukm seems to be used here in the sense of appearance, cf. p. 127, l. 4 and 196, l. 5 from foot.\n6 Apparently an adaptation of the phrase used by Haidar about his predecessor Zainu-l-'\u0101bid\u012bn.\n7 Lit. for music there was a bazaar (h\u0101t).\n8 Ta'assubh\u0101-i-khunuk-i-binamak.

He seems to contrast his bigotry and that of Haidar with the liberal spirit of his son Zainu-l-'\u0101bid\u012bn.\ndevelopment, the essentials for Kashmir, viz., unanimity and fidelity, found a bad market. And to this day there is an odour of bigotry about the Kashmiris, for there is a powerful influence in association, and especially is a strong impression produced by the ways of princes who are vigorous. It is to be hoped that by the blessing of his Majesty, the king of king's truth and chastity (kaqiqat u kaqqaniyat) Kashmir, spiritual and temporal, may attain unity, and that the articles of worship and religion may become current, unadulterated by hypocrisy and bigotry.\n\nOne of the capital and most inauspicious mistakes of the Mirz\u0101 was that in spite of such victory he read the kh\u016bfba and struck the coin in the name of N\u0101zuk Sh\u0101h after the fashion of the K\u0101shmiri ministers. He should have fulfilled his duty of loyalty towards his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and have impressed the dar\u0101him and dan\u0101n\u012br and the pulpit rostra with his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b's sacred name. Apparently he was temporising and was not giving currency to disloyalty, for when K\u0101bul\\(^1\\) was taken he honoured himself by having the kh\u016bfba read in his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b's sacred name.\n\nIn 958 (apparently October, 1551) he became, in a night attack by the Kashmiris, a traveller to the region of non-existence. The short account of this is as follows:\n\nThe Mirz\u0101 transgressed the law of justice,\u2014dominion's watchman,\u2014and took to living for his own lusts and pleasures. He let fall from his hands prudence and the bearing of burdens, those two arms of felicity. The fraud and seditiousness of the Kashmiris which had been subverted by the Mirz\u0101's skill and sagacity, again stood up and the hypocritical and wicked faction took the road of deceit and in\n\n---\n\nSee Jarrett II. 387, 388. It is clear from the T\u0101r. Rash. that Haidar was a rigid Mu\u1e25ammadan of the SunnI school and a persecutor of Sufis, &c. See Elias & Ross, p. 436. He there takes exactly the opposite view to that of A. F. with regard to Sikandar and Zainu-l-\u02bf\u0101bid\u012bn.\n\nThere are Kashmir coins bearing Hum\u0101y\u016bn's name and dated either 952 or 953. T\u0101r.

'Idi R\u012bn\u0101 and Husain M\u0101kri, son of Abd\u0101l M\u0101kri, gained over Khw\u0101ja \u1e24\u0101ji, the Kashm\u012br\u012b pedlar (bagg\u0101l), who was the manager of the M\u012brz\u0101's affairs. They drew a great many to their side and marched against the M\u012brz\u0101. Gh\u0101z\u012b Kh\u0101n and Malik Daulat Cak also joined them. Near Kh\u0101np\u016br, between Hirapur and Srinagar, which last is the chief city of Kashmir and the seat of government, they made a night-attack on the M\u012brz\u0101. He had approached the quarters of Khw\u0101ja \u1e24\u0101ji to release Qar\u0101 Bah\u0101dur, who was a prisoner. Suddenly he lost his life at the hands of Kam\u0101l D\u016bb\u012b, though some say one of his own servants unknowingly hit him with an arrow.\n\n1 T\u0101r.

Rash. App. A. 487 and Calcutta Review No.\nA. F.'s account of Haidar should be compared with Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn's and Fir\u0101hata's and also with the T\u0101r. Rash. and A. F.'s own statements in the \u0100in. In the latter he is more favourable to Haidar than in the Akbar-n\u0101ma. The translation, (Jarratt II. 340,) does not seem quite correct. What A. F., text 584, 585, says, I think, is that the Kashm\u012bris read the \u1e0du\u1e25\u1e6da in N\u0101zuk's name and that Haidar at one and the same time recognised Hum\u0101y\u016bn. The introduction of arts into Kashm\u012br which A. F. ascribes, in part, to Haidar, is modestly attributed by the M\u012brz\u0101 himself to Zainu-l-'\u0100bid\u012bn. T\u0101r. Rash. 484.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nBRIEF SKETCH OF MIRZA KAMRAN'S CAREER.\n\nAs a short account of Mirza Haidar has been given, I shall now record the actions of M. Kamran. On that ill-omened occasion when M. Kamran chose separation from his Majesty Jahangiri and proceeded towards Kabul, he on arriving at Khushab treated chiefship and pre-eminence (sari \u016b sarvari) as an affliction, and time,\u00b9 the gamester, as his ally and had the khutba read in his own name. Improperities of this kind will ever be manifested by him who maketh not far-seeing wisdom and instruction his counsellor and beloved associate. He knoweth not the duties of love nor the paths of generosity. He regardeth others' bane as his good, and scattereth evil seed in good men's fields. It is manifest what sort of crop will spring from such a sowing and tilling. And how shall the tree of his hopes yield the wished-for fruit? There is no permanency for him who takes no thought of the issue of things, nor any bond in fortune fastened to oneself by violence. What stability is there in a lofty palace wanting foundation; it soon falls to pieces like a minaret of ice! What fixity has a first night's moon which like a blinding flash of lightning vanishes in the twinkling of an eye? M. Kamran's sovereignty was quickly gone, like the freshness of a rose, and his fortune departed like the soon-dying breeze of spring!\n\nTo be brief; he came by way of Dhankot\u00b2 to the bank of the Indus. Muhammad Sultan and Ulugh Mirza who had gone into the Multan territory but had been unable to maintain themselves there,\n\n\u00b9 That is, he regarded the whirligig of time whereby Humayun had been dethroned &c. as an advantage for himself.\n\n\u00b2 Jarrett II. 401 and note, and Babar's Memoirs 140 where it is called Dinkot.\ncame and saluted M. K\u0101mr\u0101n on the river-bank. The M\u012brz\u0101 tarried there for a while, and when the rebels fell into difficulties about corn, he made a bridge and crossed the river. Thence he came to K\u0101bul and there he opened the gates of enjoyment in front of his own existence and spent his days in the indulgence of his pleasures and lusts. And Jamsh\u012bd\\(^1\\) of Merv\u2019s saying, \u201cUntil the tiger leave the jungle, the pasturage is not open for the deer; nor till the falcon seek her nest, has the partridge freedom to fly,\u201d was verified in this instance. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n gave Ghazn\u012bn and its territory to \u2018Askar\u012b M. and sent Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101wand Muhammad on an embassy to Sulaim\u0101n M. in Badakhsh\u0101n with the request that he would submit and make M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s style and coinage current in Badakhsh\u0101n also. M. Sulaim\u0101n sent back the ambassador re infect\u0101 and M. K\u0101mr\u0101n got enraged at this and led an army into Badakhsh\u0101n. Near the village of B\u0101r\u012b\\(^2\\) an engagement took place and when M. Sulaim\u0101n saw his own weakness and M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s strength he sent an envoy to knock at reconciliation\u2019s door. He caused the kh\u016b\u1e6dba to be read and coinage to be issued in M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s name; and the latter also took some Badakhsh\u0101n territory from M. Sulaim\u0101n and gave it to his own men and then returned full of success. Meanwhile news came that M. Hind\u0101l had taken possession of Qandah\u0101r. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n collected an army and marched against the city and besieged the fort for six months. M. Hind\u0101l\u2019s supplies falling short, he asked for quarter and delivered up the fort. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n gave Qandah\u0101r to M. \u2018Askar\u012b and returned to K\u0101bul, bringing M. Hind\u0101l along with him. For some days he treated M. Hind\u0101l with severity but afterwards out of brotherhood and from hypocrisy in the guise of concord, gave him the fertile tract of J\u016bi Sh\u0101h\u012b, which now bears the name of his Majesty the king of kings, and is called Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d. The ruler of Sind also submitted\\(^3\\) and now fortune was ministering the materials of negligence till M. Sulaim\u0101n broke his compact and seized of the territories which M. K\u0101mr\u0101n had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently the riddle-maker mentioned at text, 221 and Blochmann, 102.\n\n\\(^2\\) Chalmers, M\u0101r\u012b and N\u0101r\u012b in variant.

M. K\u0101mr\u0101n a second time led his army thither and a battle was fought near Andar\u0101b.\u00b9 M. Sulaim\u0101n was defeated and took refuge in Fort Zafar. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n followed him and besieged the fort. He stopped the coming of supplies and many of the inhabitants of Badakhshan came and did homage to him. As M. Sulaim\u0101n despaired of his soldiers, who were only eye-servers (cag\u0101m-i-waf\u0101 d\u0101g\u0101t) and also as the fort was in difficulties from want of supplies, he was obliged to submit. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n left Q\u0101sim B\u012brl\u0101s, Mirz\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-L\u0101h and many others of his partisans under the charge of the said B\u012brl\u0101s in Badakhshan, and himself went back (to Kabul). Khw\u0101ja Husain\u00b2 of Merv found the date of this occurrence in the words \u201cAm\u2018a hafdahum-i-m\u0101h-i-Jum\u0101da\u2019z-z\u0101n\u012b.\u201d (Friday, Jum\u0101da II, 17th, 948=October 8th, 1546). He kept M. Sulaim\u0101n and his son M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm in confinement. When he returned, he put the city into f\u00eate for a month, and spent his days in insouciance. He remembered not his God, nor did he deal justice to the oppressed. Till at length the fortune-star of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s gracious heaven ascended, and coming with dominion and suspiciousness, lodged his punishment in his bosom, as will be related hereafter.\n\n(M. Hind\u0101l.)\n\nWhoever behaves improperly to his benefactor and advances along the path of insincerity, receives the punishment of his actions in this world (lit. in the same condition). The account of M. Hind\u0101l is of this tenor. He, at such a crisis and time of strife and sedition, left the service of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, and taking the road of faithlessness proceeded towards Qandah\u0101r. When Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, who was governing Qandah\u0101r for M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, heard of the Mirz\u0101\u2019s arrival, he came out of the fort and respectfully embraced him. He made over the territory to the Mirz\u0101. Many days had not elapsed when M. K\u0101mr\u0101n came and took possession thereof. He imprisoned\n\n\u00b9 Jarrett, III. 88: N. of Hindu Kush, South West Badakhshan.\n\u00b2 Blochmann, 574. A. F.\u2019s somewhat disparaging remark about him there, may perhaps be due in part to his having celebrated a victory of K\u0101mr\u0101n. His odes on the births of Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Mur\u0101d will be found at pp. 125 and 136 of Lowe\u2019s Bed\u0101n\u012b.\n\u00b3 K\u0101mr\u0101n took Qandah\u0101r after a siege of six months.\nthe Mirz\u0101 and treated him with severity, as has already been briefly stated.\n\n(Y\u00c1DG\u0100R N\u0100\u1e62\u012aR MIRZ\u0100.)\n\nIt is certain that the end of the unfaithful, like the commencement of their deeds, is rejection by every heart (mard\u016bd-i-dilh\u0101). The wise do not place reliance (i'tib\u0101r) on unstable reliability (i'tib\u0101r). They wait in expectation of these ingrates receiving their portion so that they may be thankful and rejoice at their getting the punishment which is due for transgressions of rectitude, inasmuch as this will be a warning to mankind, and also an admonition of the repentance of the wicked. Accordingly when Y\u00e1dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br M. had been led from the right path by the deceit and perfidy of the ruler of Ta\u1e6d\u1e6da and had remained in Lohr\u012b (Rohri), he stayed nearly two months there after the departure of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. At last it became clear to him that the proposals of the ruler of Ta\u1e6d\u1e6da were all pretence, and his representations based on lies. Being helpless he abandoned his projects and proceeded towards Qandah\u0101r, though H\u0101shim Beg who was one of his truth-speaking well-wishers and well-pleasing (r\u012bz\u0101-j\u016bz\u012b) followers, told him that his joining M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and his leaving the service of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b were not approved of, and that the world was a place of retribution, and that he should reflect upon this. And it is a thing certain that the mind of him whose day of calamity is at hand, becomes darkened, that he displays audacity in injuring his benefactor, and that he reckons the advice of the right-thinking as wind and does not admit it into the ears of his understanding, and that he regards the weighty words of the wise as fables and fictions.1 Accordingly Y\u00e1dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br M. being unblessed, went toward Qandah\u0101r. He arrived at the time when M. K\u0101mr\u0101n had brought the fort of Qandah\u0101r to extremity, and did homage to him; and accompanied him to K\u0101bul. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n sent a person to the ruler of Ta\u1e6d\u1e6da and requested him to send with all respect her Highness Bilq\u012bs-mak\u0101n\u012b Shahrb\u0101n\u016b2 and her son M. Sanjar, for they had separated from Y\u00e1dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br M. and had remained in the Bhakkar territory. The ruler of Ta\u1e6d\u1e6da sent them in a suitable\n\n---\n\n1 This is singularly like the quem deus vult perdere, &c.\n2 Of the household of Bilq\u012bs, i.e., Queen of Sheba.\nmanner, together with a large number of persons who had separated from his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b and were in that territory. By mistake or design it occurred that these people were sent by the route of the waterless and forageless desert. Many of them perished and when the remainder came to Sh\u0101l, fever broke out among them. Her Highness Bilqis-mak\u0101n\u012b died. Out of 2000 or 3000 men who were wandering in that caravan, only a few escaped with their lives and reached Qandah\u0101r.\n\n1 Younger half-sister of B\u0101bar and full-sister of Y\u0101dg\u0101r's father Naq\u012br. She married Junaid Birlas, and bore him Sanjar.\nking of kings, to wit, hath attained such sway in full measure. In spite of the cares of conquering and upholding the visible world, he hath attained complete immersion in the billowy ocean of the empyreal and divine universe. And the step of his genius on the towering ascents of sublimity is firm and assured.\n\nIn fine, his Majesty determined, in accordance with the Divine will and his native nobleness to write a loving letter to the ruler of Persia and to turn the reins of intent towards that country. Should the ruler of Persia recognise hereditary right and show love and liberality, he would again give his attention to mundane matters and secure the hearts of his faithful band. Should it turn out otherwise he would in the liberty (ikhtiy\u0101r) of a hermitage, devote himself without liberty (b\u012b-ikhtiy\u0101r) to his generous nature. Accordingly on Thursday, 1st Shaww\u0101l, 959 (28th December, 1943), he sent a letter by C\u016bli Bah\u0101dur\u00b9 to the effect that by order of the superintendents of destiny, who have attached so much deliberation and knowledge to every act, an urgent cause had arisen for procuring a speedy interview. After a brief sketch of his adventures this line was written under the cover.\n\nVerse.\n\nWhat has passed over our head, has passed,\nWhether by stream, or hill, or wilderness.\n\nHis Majesty desired to spend some days in the Garmsir but Mir \u2018Abdu-l-hai of Garmsir sent to represent to him that it was rumoured that M. \u2018Askar\u012b had despatched a large force, and that possibly\u2014which God forbid\u2014they might come there, and things thus become irretrievable. If he went to the country of S\u012bst\u0101n, which belonged\n\n\u00b9 The letter is given in full in the ambassador Khur Sh\u0101h\u2019s history B. M. MS., No. 153, 58a, and the date of despatch stands there as 7th Shaww\u0101l, 950 (3rd January, 1544). Perhaps A.F. did not quote the whole because, some phrases might be regarded as too abject. After the lines above-quoted Hum\u0101y\u016bn went on to say that now the bird of desire was spreading his wings in order that he might be rewarded by beholding the sun of greatness and glory, viz., Tahm\u0101sp.\n\n\u00b2 Perhaps the Jai Bah\u0101dur formerly mentioned. As we have seen, Hum\u0101y\u016bn gave the name of C\u016bli to all who accompanied him across Bal\u016bcist\u0101n.\nto the King of Persia, he would be protected from that reckless crew. His Majesty reflected on the paucity of the sincere, and the plurality of the lords of opposition and discord, and recognised the fact that to stay in that country was to act carelessly, and so he proceeded towards S\u012bst\u0101n. He crossed the H\u012brmand (Halmand) and halted at a lake into which its waters flow. Ahmad Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101ml\u016b, the governor of S\u012bst\u0101n, recognised the advent as an unexpected blessing and tendered acceptable service and showed alacrity in offering hospitality. His Majesty spent some days in that pleasant country, the arena of the cavaliers of fortune's plain, in the sport of catching waterfowl. And in order to comfort his faithful comrades he busied himself with worldly matters and was a spectator of the wonders of destiny. Thence he proceeded to (the city of?) S\u012bst\u0101n. Ahmad Sult\u0101n sent his mother and his wives to wait on her Majesty Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b, and tendered all the revenues (amw\u0101l) of his district as a present. His Majesty accepted a little of these in order to do him pleasure, and returned the remainder. In this halting place \u1e24usain Quli M. the brother of Ahmad Sult\u0101n, who had come from Mashhad to pay his respects to his mother and brother, in order that he might bid adieu to them before he went on pilgrimage, was honoured by an audience. His Majesty questioned him about\n\n1 Lake H\u0101m\u016bn. See Reclus 47 and 48. It is also called the Sea of Durra, or Zereng.

This appears to be the coot (fulica atra). See Scully's App. to Shaw's Turk. Dict. p. 213 s.v. q\u0101shq\u0101ld\u0101q. See also P. de Courteille's Dict. s.v. qanq\u0101ld\u0101gh where it is translated \"plongeon noir\" and is said to be equivalent to Persian m\u0101gh. In B\u0101ya-z\u012bd's Moms. 2 b. the word is spelt qanq\u0101lad\u0101gh, and we are told that the shik\u0101r or sport was carried on ba-lark\u0101z. Erskine in his MS. translation queries if this be stubble. Perhaps we should read t\u012brgas or harpoon, the gaz being a double-headed arrow, and suppose that the sport was carried on in the manner described by B\u0101bar, (pp. 153, 154) by means of a harpoon.\n\n4 I presume that this must be a city of that name for he was already in the district. Probably it is the place mentioned by Elphinstone under the name of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d. B\u0101ya-z\u012bd has Qa\u1e63ba-i-S\u012bst\u0101n, the town of S\u012bst\u0101n. Raverty (Tabaq\u0101t-i-n\u0101siri 1122a.) speaks of Zaranj as being called the city of S\u012bst\u0101n.\n\n5 By the distinction of kissing the carpet.\nreligion and faith. He submitted that he had long studied the creeds of the Shi'as and Sunnis, and had perused the books of both sects. The Shi'as maintained that the reviling and cursing of the Companions was meritorious and a means of religious progress, whereas the Sunnis held that to blaspheme the Companions was an act of impiety. After consideration and meditation he had satisfied himself that no one can become impious by thinking he is doing right. His Majesty much approved this remark, and with great kindness and condescension offered him the honour of service. As he was about to go on pilgrimage and had made his arrangements accordingly, he was debarred from this boon. Here also H\u00e1ji Mu\u1e25ammad (son of) B\u0101b\u0101 Q\u0101shq\u0101, and \u1e24asan K\u014dka left M. 'Askari and joined the noble army. They recommended that his Majesty should proceed towards Zain\u012bn D\u0101w\u0101r because Amir Beg, the governor, thereof was coming to serve, and Calma Beg, governor of the fort of Bast, was also solicitous of the honour of employment; (and said also) that soon many men of M. 'Askari would separate from him and enter his Majesty's service; and that Qandah\u0101r and its territory would come into the possession of the royal servants. When Ahmad Sul\u1e6d\u0101n heard that they were giving this advice and were deterring his Majesty from going to Persia, he came to his Majesty and submitted, out of well-wishing and affection, that the expedition to Persia was worthy of his genius and that the faction which was dissuading him from going, was only actuated by fraud and treachery. As Ahmad Sul\u1e6d\u0101n had by his devotion and sincerity established himself in his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b's heart, his representations were accepted and acted upon. The Emperor determined to proceed to 'Ir\u0101q. On account of this affair H\u00e1ji Mu\u1e25. K\u014dka was for some days excluded from the presence. Ahmad Sul\u1e6d\u0101n attended on the stirrup, and wished to be a guide for the road, by way of Tabas Kilaki. As his Majesty had set his heart on visiting Her\u0101t, he took the road by the fort of \u016ak.\n\n1 This story and much of the narrative of events in S\u012bst\u0101n are taken from B\u0101yaz\u012bd. See I. O. MS. No. 216, p. 3a.\n2 Afterwards a very distinguished officer. See Blochmann, 368.\n3 A town in Khur\u0101s\u0101n. Jarrett III. 67.

It lay on the road from S\u012bst\u0101n to Qasw\u012bn (then the capital) and was a long way west of Her\u0101t.\n4 See Raverty trans. Tabaq\u0101t-i-n\u0101\u1e63iri, 34 and 1122n. He says \u016ak lies\nWhen the loving letter of his Majesty Jah\u0101nsh\u0101h Jannat-eshy\u0101ni reached Shah Tahmasp, he regarded his Majesty's auspicious advent as an unlooked for blessing and felt delighted. He wished that the glorious shadow of the auspicious hum\u0101 (hum\u0101-i-sa\u02bf\u0101dat-i-humay\u016bni) might fall on the crest of his own fortune, and that the experience of this grace might form the inframing border for the record of the splendour of his family. In acknowledgment of the blessing he bade the drums of rejoicing beat for three days in Qazwin. And he wrote a reply full of respect and veneration and of wishes for his Majesty's speedy arrival, with thousands of lands and encumia, and sent it along with various gifts and rarities by his special courtiers. This verse was written on the border (\"amw\u0101n\") of the letter.\n\nVerse.\n\n\"A hum\u0101 of auspicious soaring falls into our net,\nIf for thee there chance a passage to our abode.\"\n\nHe sent back the messenger after doing him special honour, and expressed all manner of thankfulness and gratitude, and recalled old friendship. He also wrote to the governors of the cities and towns that at every city and halting-place where the august progress should rest, the leading men and the inhabitants, high and low, should keep the occasion as the f\u00eate, day of the royal family, and should go out to welcome his Majesty and should engage in royal feastings; also that they should provide at each stage proper materials and furnishings, food and drink, and fresh fruits, such as might be worthy of his Majesty's regard. An exact copy of the ordinance which was addressed to Muhammad Kh\u0101n, the governor of Her\u0101t, is here set forth that it may be a code of regulations for the intelligent and that those alive to the ways of humanity may, by looking at this frontispiece of urbanity, act with philanthropy, honouring and reverencing the unfortunate who\n\nbetween Farah and Zaranj and has been in ruins for many years.

Blochmann, 426, remarks that the word does not occur in our dictionaries. Apparently it is a form of l\u0101l\u0101, a major-domo, tutor, &c. Wollaston gives both l\u0101l\u0101 and lallah, s. v., tutor, but marks the last as vulgar.\n\n3 Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25. M. eldest son of Tahm\u0101sp, and often called Mu\u1e25. Khu'd\u0101banda. He became king in 1578, but was a weak and unworthy ruler and soon disappeared. See Oliver. J. A. S. B. 1877, Vol. 56, p. 43.\n\n4 Apparently a translation of the Turkish title beglar-begi which occurs in the letter as given in B. M. MS., Or. 4678.\n\n5 According to Malcolm, Sh\u0101ml\u016b means a son of Syria and refers to the fact that the tribe was brought from Syria by Tim\u016br.\n\n6 Price points out that there is a difficulty about this date, for A. F. describes Hum\u0101y\u016bn as reaching Her\u0101t on 1st Z\u012bl-q\u0101'da, or about 1\u00bd months before Mu\u1e25. Kh\u0101n's letter was received by Tahm\u0101sp. He suggests that the names of the months should be transposed. Probably the date in A. F.'s copy of the letter is altogether wrong, and the true date is that given in B. M. MS. Or. 4678, vis., Tuesday, 5th Shaww\u0101l, 950 (1st January, 1544). In the copy there given Tahm\u0101sp describes himself as answering the letter on the same day. It was brought to him by \u1e24asan Beg Takl\u016b. Hum\u0101y\u016bn wrote to Tahm\u0101sp, according to A. F., on Thursday, 1st Shaww\u0101l, 950, and probably Mu\u1e25. Kh\u0101n, the governor of Her\u0101t, would write about the same time to his master. If Thursday was 1st Shaww\u0101l, however, the following Sunday would be the 6th, not the 5th, unless we count, as the Mu\u1e25ammadans do from sunset to sunset.\n\nI have however found in the Ma'\u0101-\nAs to what has been written concerning the approach of the fortunate vicegerent (naww\u0101b-i-k\u0101my\u0101b, i.e., Humay\u016bn), sphere-rider, sun-cupola, pearl of success and sovereignty's ocean, goodly tree ornamenting the garden of government and world-away, world-illuminating light of the portico of sovereignty and glory, soaring cypress of the stream of auspiciousness and fortune, aromatic tree of glory and majesty's rose-garden, fruit of the tree of the khilafat and of justice, king of land and sea (harrain u ba\u1e6dr\u0101in), world-warming sun of felicity's heaven, exalted full-moon of the zenith of the khilafat and world-rule, altar and exemplar of just princes, greatest and best of the kh\u0101q\u0101ns, the lord of majesty, high-born sovereign of supremacy's throne, exalted king of the kingdom of the dispensation of justice, kh\u0101q\u0101n of Alexander-type, glorious potentate, an enthroned Solomon, lord of guidance and assurance, world-guardian, lord of diadem and throne (t\u0101j u takht), s\u0101\u1e25ib-qir\u0101n (lord of conjunction) of the world of fortune and prestige, crowning diadem of famous kh\u0101q\u0101ns, the aided by God, defender of the Faith (Na\u1e63\u012br-ad-d\u012bn) Mu\u1e25ammad Humay\u016bn Padsh\u0101h.

How may it be told what joy and delight have been caused by this.\n\nVerse.\n\nGood news, O courier of the morn, thou bringest of the friend's advent.\nMay thy tidings be true, O thou ever the friend's intimate.\nMay that day come when, in the feast of meeting,\nI shall sit, having my heart's desire, breathing in unison with the friend!\n\n\u0161ir-i-r\u0101d\u012bm\u012b (A. S. B. MS. p. 170b), a reading which seems to me to remove some difficulties and to be perhaps the right one. This is that instead of Z\u012bl-hijja we have D\u0101y-i-Hajjista,\u2014not \u0634\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062f\u0650\u06cc but \u0634\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062f\u0652\u06cc. The date thus would be the 12th of the Persian month D\u0101y, which corresponds to December. But if this is so the governor of \u1e24er\u0101t must have written to his sovereign before Humay\u016bn actually entered Persia. R\u0101y\u0101n\u012b has Z\u012bl-hijja 949! I must admit here that though the \u1e0du\u1e63\u016bl is plain enough in the Ma'\u0101sir yet the d\u0101l of D\u0101y is dotted (\u0634\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062f\u0652\u06cc) as if the copyist, at any rate, meant it for Z\u0101l.\n\n1 Saba', rising; also east wind. Perhaps used here because Humay\u016bn was then in eastern Persia, and Tahmasp was in the west, in Qazwin.\nRecognising that the untroubled progress and approach of this king, the angel of honour, are a great boon, be it known that, in guerdon of the glad tidings, we have bestowed the territory of Sabzw\u0101r\\(^1\\) on that asylum of dominion (i.e., Muhammad Kh\u0101n the addressee) from the beginning of Aries\\(^2\\) of the year of the Hare. Let him send his d\u0101r\u014dgha and vizier there, that the regular revenue and the extraordinary civil receipts thereof may be perceived from the beginning of the current year, and be expended for the requirements of the victorious troops and his own necessities. Having acted, paragraph by paragraph, and day by day, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this edict (nis\u0101l\u0101n), let there be no remissness concerning the paramount instructions.\n\nLet him appoint five hundred prudent and experienced men, each of whom shall have a led\\(^3\\) horse, a riding mule, and the necessary accoutrements, that they may go forth to meet the king, the lord of fortune,\u2014with one\\(^4\\) hundred swift horses which have been sent from the sublime court for the use of his Majesty, together with golden saddles; and let the asylum of dominion select from his own stable six swift horses, quiet, of good colour and strong, and such as may be fit for the riding of that royal cavalier of the field of glory\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A town in Khur\u0101s\u0101n, west of N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br and between Maghhad and the Caspian. Blochmann, 55n. and Jarrett III. 85. But there is also a Sabzw\u0101r, south of Her\u0101t, and probably this is the place meant. This Sabzw\u0101r is properly \u1e24epa-z\u0101r or horse-meadow, and is so written in the copy of the Sh\u0101h's letter in the Ma'\u0101gir-i-ra\u1e25\u012bm\u012b.\n\n\\(^2\\) Text, 'amal, but the Lucknow edition and three B.M. MSS. have hamal, and this seems correct. The Turkish, or Aighurian, cycle seems to have been used in official documents, &c., and began in Aries, as also did the Persian year. Tushq\u0101n, or the year of the Hare was the fourth of the cycle. Jarrett II. (I) 21.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u1e24ep-i-kutal. Kutal, or k\u016btal, is used to mean a second or substituted article. (Blochmann 109, 115.) The Bah\u0101r-i-ajam explains it, when applied to horses, as meaning an animal strong enough to form part of the procession before a king's carriage, a processional horse in short. Such horses formed part of the istiqb\u0101l which met the Persian-Afgh\u0101n Mission on its approach to Maghhad. (Eastern Persia. Goldsmid and others. Macmillan, 1876. p. 357.)\n\n\\(^4\\) B\u0101yaz\u012bd has three only and this is probably correct. Tahm\u0101sp would hardly send 100 horses with golden saddles, nor if he did, would he be likely to tell Sharafu-d-d\u012bn to add six. The six were probably added to the three to make the mystic nine.\nand success; and let him place on them azure and embroidered saddles, with housings of gold brocade and gold thread, such as may befit the riding-horses of that majestic king; and let him make over each horse to two of his own servants, and despatch them. A splendid, special side-dagger ornamented with exquisite jewels which came to us from the fortunate viceregent, the pardoned prince of sublime seat, the king our father\u2014May God make his proof clear!\u2014together with a golden scimitar (\u0161ams\u0101r) and a jewelled girdle, have been sent to the Alexander-principled king, for victory and conquest and good augury. Four hundred pieces of velvet and satin from Europe and Yezd have been sent, so that one hundred and twenty coats may be made for the king's special use, and that the remainder may be for the servants attached to the victorious stirrup of that fortunate prince; also two-pile gold-brocaded velvet carpets and coverlets (namad takya) of goat's hair with satin lining, and three pairs of large carpets twelve cubits (square?) four Goshk\u0101n of fine silk; and twelve tents, crimson, green and white, have been sent. May they arrive safely!\n\nLet arrangements be made day by day for sweet and pleasant drinks, with white loaves kneaded with milk and butter and seasoned with fennel seeds and poppy seeds. Let them be well made and be sent to his Majesty. Let them also be sent for each member of his staff and for his other servants. Be it also arranged that at the places where his Majesty will halt, there be arranged and pitched, on the previous day, cleansed, pleasant, white, embroidered tents and awnings of silk and velvet, and also pantries and kitchens and all their necessary out-offices, so that every requisite apparatus be in readiness. When he, in his glory and fortune, shall direct a halt, let rose-water-sherbet and wholesome lemon-juice be prepared and poured out, after having been cooled with snow and ice. After the sherbet\n\n120 were perhaps intended as a supply for a twelvemonth. Cf.

And during those three days let the said officers and the various troops be inspected. Be careful to give your servants tip\u016bc\u0101q and Arab horses, for there is no finer decoration for a soldier than a good horse; and let the uniforms of the one thousand be coloured and smart. And be it arranged that, when the officers come to wait upon his Majesty, they kiss the ground of service and honour with the lip of respect and render their service one by one. Be it seen to that, on the occasion of riding, &c., there be no altercation between the officers' servants and his Majesty's, and that no annoyance of any kind happen to the king's servants. During the time of riding and of marching, let the officers remain with their own troops and serve the king from a distance, but at the time of being on guard, let each officer display his alacrity in the vicinity of the quarters which shall have been fixed (for the Emperor); and let them, having taken in their hands the staffs of service, serve in the manner that one would serve one's own king, and let them adopt and bring into practice the utmost attentiveness.

And when the officers aforesaid come to serve, every day there will be produced in the sublime banquet of that king, 1,200 dishes of varied food, such as may be fit for a royal table. And let each of the aforesaid officers, on the day when he is host, tender a present of nine horses, of which three will be for the king's special use, one for the chief amir Mu\u1e25.

When he shall arrive at twelve farsakhs from the said province,\u2074 the asylum of dominion (i.e., the governor) will leave one of his experienced officers\u2075 in charge of our dear and excellent son, that he may take care of the city and wait on the son. The remainder of the victorious army from the city and province, and its boundaries, consisting of the Haz\u0101ra,\u2076 Nikod\u0101ri and others, to the number of thirty thousand, which number must be exact, shall go forth with the asylum of dominion to offer welcome.

And on the same day that he be distinguished by service he will halt in accordance with the rules (tuzak) and regulations of an army in camp. The asylum of dominion, when he has come on duty, will request leave, in order that he may entertain his Majesty, and will establish himself for three days in those quarters.

Let the utmost zeal be displayed in service, and let the march from the said quarters to the city occupy four days, and let the entertainment of each day be the same as on the first. And it is proper that at every entertainment the honoured sons of the asylum of dominion bind, like servants and waiters, girdles of service on their loins and perform worshipful ministration, and that, in thanksgiving that such a king, who is a gift from the gifts of God, has become our guest, they display the utmost alacrity in service; and do not let there be any failure, for the more zeal and devotion are displayed in respect of his Majesty, the more will be the approval by us.

And, for the time that he is proceeding to the city, let the asylum of dominion place Qazz\u0101q Sult\u0101n on duty (with Hum\u0101y\u016bn), and let tents and camels and horses be presented, so that, when the fortunate Naww\u0101b mounts his horse next day, the camp may also march, and let the aforesaid asylum of dominion be the guide. When the son shall come out of the city, strive that all the troops mount in the prescribed order, and that they proceed towards the welcoming. When near that king, the Court of Majesty, viz., when the space intervening be an arrow's flight, let the asylum of dominion advance and beg the king not to dismount. If he agree, let him return immediately and dismount the happy son, and let the last go quickly and kiss the thigh and stirrup of that king of Solomon's Court and show all the points of service and respect and honour which are possible. Should the fortunate Naww\u0101b not agree, and should he dismount, let the son dismount before him and do homage and, his Majesty having first mounted, let our son kiss the king's hand and mount, and proceeding on thus, ride according to etiquette to the camp and the fixed quarters. And let the asylum of dominion be in attendance on the king, and close to the son, so that, if the king should put any questions to the son, and the son, out of bashfulness, be unable to reply, the asylum of dominion may make a proper reply. And in the quarters aforesaid let that son show hospitality to the king according to this routine, viz., at about 9 A.M. let 300 dishes of varied foods be at once presented by way of refection.

And let one of the officers aforesaid be a coadjutor with each artificer, so that by their mutual rivalry every craft and excellent device may be executed. This is excellent that, as the king hath exalted this country by his distinguished advent, he should first come to a city which is the light of the eyes of mankind. Let there then be brought before his alchemic eye genial and sweet-spoken persons, such as are in this city, so that he may have cause for cheerfulness. On the third day when your mind shall be at rest with regard to the cah\u0101r-t\u0101q, the City-Avenue, and the brightening up of the Cah\u0101r B\u0101gh let heralds be appointed in the city, its wards, and the environs, and the neighbouring villages, to proclaim that all the men and women of the city shall assemble on the morning of the fourth day in the Avenue (khiy\u0101b\u0101n), and that in every shop and b\u0101z\u0101r, where carpets and cloths shall be spread in order, the women and maidens will be seated, and, as is the rule in that city, the women will engage in pleasant\n\n1 The text does not seem quite correct here. All the I.O. MSS. have lashkar\u012b and not merely lashkar and the proper reading seems to be lashkar\u012b u ba har nafar. The account about the t\u016bm\u0101ns is not clear. Perhaps the 300 gold t\u016bm\u0101ns were a special present to Humayun. And perhaps the 30 purses were to be made of the silk.\n\n2 The sh\u0101h\u012b is worth about a half penny, so that if the t\u016bm\u0101n be reckoned at 8/8 three would be about equal to 600 sh\u0101h\u012b. The figures in the text are, however, doubtful.\n\n3 An erection with four domes; a quadrangular tent, or canopy, apparently.\n\n4 Text, begh\u0101, i.e., chiefs, but I take the word to be baikak\u0101, i.e., maidens from b\u0101ka which P. de Courteille renders femme non mari\u00e9e.\n\n5 Dar maq\u0101m-i-sh\u012br\u012bn k\u0101r\u012b u sh\u012br\u012bn g\u016bl dar \u0101yand. One of the meanings of maq\u0101m is a musical tone, and k\u0101r\u012b and k\u0101t\u012bk\u0101 are used by B\u0101bar to mean airs or melodies. See his Memoirs, Erskine 197 and 198, and notes. So possibly all that is meant here is that the women were to recite\nsayings and doings with the comers and goers. And from every ward and lane let the masters\\(^1\\) of melody come forth, so that the like of it will not be seen in any other city of the world. And bid all the people come forth to offer welcome. After all this has been arranged, let the king be respectfully asked to put the foot of dominion in the stirrup of auspiciousness, and to mount on horseback. Our son will proceed alongside of his Majesty, but so that the head and neck of the latter's horse be in front.\\(^2\\) You, the asylum of dominion, will follow close behind, so that, if he should put any questions about the buildings, the palaces, and gardens, you may make suitable reply. And when he shall come with auspiciousness to the city, he will visit the Cah\u0101r B\u0101gh. And let him alight in the small garden which was made at the time of our residence in that delicious city for the purpose of our living there and of reading and writing, and which is at present known by the name of B\u0101gh Sh\u0101hi. And make the baths in the Cah\u0101r B\u0101gh white and clean, and also the other baths, and make them fragrant with rose-water and musk, so that, whenever he is inclined, he may have a place for bodily repose.\n\nOn the first day our son will show hospitality with abundance of provisions, and when he shall have gone to his repose, you, the asylum of dominion, will display hospitality in the manner that will be described below.\\(^3\\) When he (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) enters the city, you will\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This might mean women as well as men.\n\n\\(^2\\) The letter in B. M. MS. Or. 467 is still more explicit. The head of the prince's horse is to be on a line with Hum\u0101y\u016bn's stirrup, and the head of the tutor's horse on a line with the prince's stirrup.\n\n\\(^3\\) A. F. appears to have missed out some words here. In B\u0101yaz\u012bd 96, we have \"On the first day our son will show his Majesty abundant and excellent hospitality, and at night when he (the son) shall have gone to rest, the asylum of dominion (Sharafu-d-d\u012bn) will call the great officers into his presence and direct that each one of them shall entertain the king who is favoured by God, one day in one of the gardens.

And let it be arranged that Mu'izzu-d-din \u1e24usain kal\u0101ntar (magistrate), of Her\u00e2t, appoint a good writer who is a man of experience, to write a full diary from the day that the 500 make the reception (istiqb\u0101l) to the day that he comes to the city, and let it be sealed and despatched by the asylum of dominion, and let all the stories and remarks, good or bad, which pass in the assemblage, be reduced to writing and be sent by the hands of trusty persons, so that we be fully informed of all that occurs.\n\nThe entertaining by the asylum of dominion will be as follows:\u2014Three thousand dishes of food, sweetmeats, syrups (gh\u012bra) and fruits will be prepared, and the necessary furniture will be arranged as follows:\u2014First, fifty tents and twenty awnings, and the large store-tent* which was reported to have been prepared for his Majesty's special use, with twelve pairs of carpets of twelve cubits and ten cubits, and seven pairs of carpets of five cubits, nine strings of female camels, 250 porcelain plates, large and small, and other plates and pots, all with bright covers, and also tinned (qalqal'i karda), and two strings of mules let the asylum of dominion present on the occasion of his entertainment; and let the officers conduct their entertainments as follows:\u2014Let them present food, sweetmeats and comfits to the extent of 1,500 plates, and also three horses, a string of camels and a string of mules, which shall have first been seen and approved by the asylum of dominion. The governors of Gh\u016bri\u0101n, F\u016bshanj,* and Karsh\u016b will show hospitality in their own country.

It is farsang\u012b earlier in the letter.\n\n2 This letter seems to have been greatly admired and appears in several collections of letters. It also appears in the Ma'\u0101gir-i-rah\u012bm\u012b but merely as a copy from the Ak-barn\u0101ma. Erskine thinks that A. F. copied it from B\u0101yaz\u012bd, and this is very likely. There are occasional omissions and alterations in A. F.'s transcript which were probably made by him as improvements, or to show that he was not a servile copyist. Thus A. F. omits in one place the title Jannat-\u0101ghiy\u0101n\u012b which in B\u0101yaz\u012bd is given by Tahm\u0101sp to his own father, Ism\u0101'il, but which perhaps A. F. considered too sacred to be applied to anybody but Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Then in the list of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's titles at the beginning of the letter we have in B\u0101yaz\u012bd after the words \"'adl-gustar\u012b,\" dispenser of justice), and before the words kh\u0101q\u0101n-i-sikandar-nish\u0101n\u2014the jingling addition of s\u0101hib-i-dev-upari, lord of demons and fairies, which A. F. perhaps omitted as not being sufficiently dignified. On the other hand, A. F. gives the names of three persons who are to entertain Hum\u0101y\u016bn, which do not occur in B\u0101yaz\u012bd.\n\nB\u0101yaz\u012bd says the document was produced on 20th Rajab, 1000 H. by M\u012br Mird\u0101d Juv\u012bn\u012b, d\u0101r\u014dgha of the records, and that he made an exact copy of it. Probably he did, for at the end he seems also to have copied an endorsement or other writing on the document to the effect that in 990 A. H. a copy was taken for the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-alf\u012b (Record of a thousand years). Possibly, however, this was an endorsement made simultaneously with B\u0101yaz\u012bd's copy and meant to show that the copy was made for B\u0101yaz\u012bd's use in connection with the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-alf\u012b. The 990 may be the era of the rihlat or death of Muhammad which was adopted by Akbar for this work, and which began ten years after the Hijra. I have examined the copy of the second volume of the T\u0101r-i-alf\u012b in the B. M. Or. 465, but the letter is not in it. Indeed the events of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's reign are very cursorily referred to, and as if it was contemplated that they should be dealt with separately by A. F.\n\nIn his introduction to the letter, B\u0101yaz\u012bd tells us that Hum\u0101y\u016bn took counsel with Ahmad Sult\u0101n about visiting the Sh\u0101h, and that Ahmad recommended him to go by Tabas-kilak\u012b as being the shortest, but that Hum\u0101y\u016bn said that life was uncertain, and that as he had heard much praise of Her\u0101t (perhaps from his parents) he would like to go that way. So he went by \u016ak and there was met by 'Al\u012b Sult\u0101n, a relation of Sharafu-d-d\u012bn. Both Ahmad Sult\u0101n and Sharafu-d-d\u012bn wrote to Tahm\u0101sp and received replies.\n\nIn B.M.MS. Or. 4678, Rieu's Cat. Supplement, there is at p. 117b et seq., a letter from Tahm\u0101sp to Sharafu-d-d\u012bn which closely resembles that given by A. F., but still is\nWhen his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b came near Far\u0101h,\u00b9 the Sh\u0101h\u2019s ambassador and his Majesty\u2019s messenger arrived, and his Majesty was made aware that the king of Persia regarded his advent as a great gain and was delighted at it. His Majesty, being a mine of courtesy, could not resist going to \u2018Ir\u0101q and so pleasing his faithful companions. He placed the foot of resolve in the stirrup of dominion and went on with a firm determination towards Her\u0101t. At every stage some one of the notables and grandees of Khur\u0101s\u0101n came out to meet him, and waited upon him as if he had been one of his own confidential courtiers. The sound of the royal cort\u00e9ge opened the gates of joy for the inhabitants, and the people of many towns, such as J\u0101m,\u00b2 Turbat,\u00b3 Sarakhas,\u2074 Isfara\u012bn,\u2075 came to Her\u0101t in expectation of the sublime advent. When the couriers of T\u0101t\u0101r Sult\u0101n, and of the nobles of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, who had gone forth to welcome him, reported to Muhammad Kh\u0101n that the sublime procession had come near the Ziy\u0101ratg\u0101h,\u2076 the latter himself came out, accompanied by the nobles such as Wais Sult\u0101n, Sh\u0101h Qul\u012b Sult\u0101n and the distinguished men of learning such as M\u012br Murta\u1e93\u0101 \u1e62adr, M\u012br \u1e24usain of Kerbal\u0101 and other excellent persons, and by the people generally.

Perhaps Carakhs is meant.\n\n\u2075 This too is a remote place S. of Burjnaid and N. W. of Nish\u0101p\u016br. Also called Mihrj\u0101n, Jarrett III. 85.\n\n\u2076 Not mentioned in Tahm\u0101sp\u2019s letter as given by A. F., but in the copy in Or. 4678 T\u0101t\u0101r Beg is directed to be sent out to welcome Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n\n\u2077 There are many shrines near Her\u0101t. I do not know which this is. See Yates\u2019s Notes on Her\u0101t, J. A. S. B. 56 for 1887, p. 84.\n\n\u2078 B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem. 207n. Erskine says, M\u0101l\u0101n is the name of the river that passes Her\u0101t coming from the east. If so, it is another name for the Har\u012b R\u0101d. It is also spelt M\u0101l\u012bn, Jarrett III. 87. Conolly II. 51 says, \u201cFour miles from the city we crossed the Herirood by a long bridge of brick called Pool-i-Moulaun, which gives a name to the river. So much of the water had been drawn off\nmet him and conveyed to him the Sh\u00e2h's felicitations and those respectful greetings which are magnanimity's essence. It had already been arranged that the roads should be swept and watered from the M\u00e2l\u00e2n Bridge up to the Jah\u00e2n\u00e2r\u00e2 Garden, and that the grandees and the ingenious men (zuraf\u00e2)\u00b9 of the city should come from either side and wait upon him. When the royal party arrived at a certain stage Sult\u00e2n Mu\u1e25ammad Mirz\u00e2 came and welcomed him, and paid his reverential respects. That fortunate Prince and the other great officers treated him with all honour and respect. From the Ziy\u00e2ratg\u00e2h\u00b2 to Pul-i-M\u00e2l\u00e2n, and from thence to the Jah\u00e2n\u00e2r\u00e2 Garden\u2014a distance of three or four leagues, the whole plain and the heights were filled with spectators from the city and the villages, and the crowd and the rejoicings were such as never occur but at the \u2018\u012ad and on New Year's day. On 1st Zilqa\u2019d\u00e2,\u00b3 950 (27th January, 1544), he alighted at B\u00e2gh Jah\u00e2n\u00e2r\u00e2. Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e2n gave a royal feast and tendered large presents. At the first assembly S\u00e2bir Q\u00e2q, the foremost reciter in Khur\u00e2s\u00e2n and \u2018Ir\u00e2q, chanted an ode of Amir Sh\u00e2hi\u2074 to the air Sihg\u00e2h\u2075 so that even rapt devotees were moved by it. In truth it was very appropriate and affecting. It began thus\u2014\n\n\"Blest the abode to which such a moon hath come,\nAugust the world where there is such a king.\"\n\nWhen he came to the verse\n\n\"Be nor grieved nor glad at terrestrial pain or pleasure\nFor the world is sometimes this and sometimes that\"\n\nabove, that the stream here was inconsiderable, but it was swift, and clear as a diamond.\" Mohan L\u00e2l says it had 33 arches, but now only 27.\n\n\u00b9 I adopt the variant. The text has zhuraf\u00e2 nobles.\n\n\u00b2 Perhaps it should be \"the stage of Darqar\u00e2.\"\n\n\u00b3 I have already remarked that this date seems wrong. It is also inconsistent with A. F.'s statement that the Persian New Year was near at hand for that occurs in the middle of March.\n\n\u2074 A Persian poet of the first half of the 15th century. Rieu 640a.\n\n\u2075 Sih k\u00e2h in text. Sihg\u00e2h, i.e., three times, is the name of an air. Vide Vullers II. 354b. and the Burh\u00e2n-i-Q\u00e2t\u00ee. B\u00e2bar p. 19 speaks of the C\u00e2rg\u00e2h key. I think the reference is to a musical air, but the words, which are darmaq\u00e2m-i-sih k\u00e2h, may mean a place, viz., the K\u00e2hdast\u00e2n, T\u00e2r. Rash. 206n., and B\u00e2bar 207 who mentions both the bridge of K\u00e2h and the K\u00e2hdast\u00e2n. For the use of the words dar maq\u00e2m, to mean in the manner or fashion, see above p. 428, note 5.\nHis Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was touched and deeply affected, and poured presents into the skirts of his hopes.\n\nAs Her\u0101t and its sights pleased him much, and the New Year festival was at hand he stayed several days there. Whenever he rode out sight-seeing Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n was in attendance and paid his respects and scattered gold on each side of his Majesty. Every day he visited some famous spot, and on each occasion there was a joyous assemblage. Everything was managed on a prescribed plan. Sometimes his heart was solaced with the K\u0101rizg\u0101h, (the place of underground channels) and sometimes the B\u0101gh Mur\u0101d, the B\u0101gh Khiy\u0101b\u0101n, the B\u0101gh Z\u0101gh\u0101n,\u00b9 and the B\u0101gh Safed\u00b2 were visited. In every flowering spot there were particoloured assemblages. Also on these days he visited the shrines of the great saints, especially that of Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdull\u0101h Ans\u0101r\u012b, the Saint of Her\u0101t. May his grave be holy! Ascetics, religious persons, lofty-souled men and famous men of learning were honoured by his company.\n\nWhen the festivities of the New Year were over and the places of recreation had been visited, he proceeded towards Holy Mashhad by the way of J\u0101m. At this time A\u1e25mad Sult\u0101n, Governor of S\u012bst\u0101n, who had accompanied his Majesty hitherto, took leave to go to his own province. On 5th Zil\u1e25ajja\u2074 he reached J\u0101m and visited the shrine of His Highness Zhinda Pil A\u1e25mad-i-J\u0101m.

We are told immediately below that Hu-\n\nm\u0101y\u016bn arrived at Mashhad on 15th Mu\u1e25arram, and surely he would hardly have taken six weeks to get there from J\u0101m. Besides we are told that he spent the Persian New Year at Her\u0101t which he could not have done if he had left it in February. If the date given in J. R. A. S. for January, 1897, p. 47, be correct, Hu-m\u0101y\u016bn must have paid a second visit to J\u0101m some ten months later, for the date of the inscription put up by him there is 14th Shaww\u0101l, 951 = 29th December, 1544.\nSaiyids, and all paid their respects. On 15th Muharram, 951, he reached Holy Mashhad and visited the shrine of (Im\u0101m) Riz\u0101vi,\u2014may the blessing of God be upon him! He spent some days in the precincts of that noble building. Thence he went to N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br. Shamsu-d-d\u012bn \u2018Al\u012b Sult\u0101n, who governed there, came with great and small and paid his respects, and was prompt with various services. His Majesty visited the turquoise mines in that neighbourhood, and from thence went to Sabzaw\u0101r and from thence to D\u0101magh\u0101n. Among the marvellous things of that place is an ancient fountain which has a talisman from of old, to wit, whenever any dirty thing falls into the fountain a storm arises, and the sky grows dark from the force of the wind and the dust. This too he examined with the eye of prescience. How many things are there not in the wondrous workshop of the Creator, the understanding of which does not come within the scope of our thoughts and imaginings? From D\u0101magh\u0101n he went on to Bist\u0101m and as the shrine of Bahrt\u0101mi Shaikh Bay\u0101zid Bist\u0101m\u012b (may his grave be sanctified) was not on the line of road he turned aside to visit it.

B\u0101dkhaneh. In Eastern Persia by Goldsmid and others, p. 381. We find the following, \u201cFerrier has written of the high wind so prevalent here. The Persians say that it is occasioned by a mystic spring in the mountain about two farsakhs off which, the moment anything dirty is thrown into it, causes a tremendous gale to blow, which lasts several days, till the spring is purified, and a sentry is always kept at the well to prevent tampering with its waters. It is said that when the Sh\u0101h passed through D\u0101magh\u0101n en route for Mashhad, being incredulous of the story he ordered some of his suite to throw dirt into the spring when immediately such a wind arose that the royal camp was rolled up like so much paper, and the Sh\u0101h was compelled to have the cistern completely cleaned out and purified before the wind would cease.\u201d D\u0101magh\u0101n is supposed to be the old capital of the Parthians, the Hecatompylos of the Greeks. It may be noted that B\u0101bar, 149, tells a story about a fountain in Ghazn\u012b, similar to that about the one in D\u0101magh\u0101n.\n\n3 Jarrett III. 85v. and Meynard 104. It is N.

His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b halted at Qazwin,\u2076 which was at that time the Sh\u0101h\u2019s capital. The grandees and inhabitants generally came out to welcome him. He remained some days there, visiting the remarkable buildings and holy places in the city, and taking up his abode in the house of Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdulghani who was the city Magistrate (Kal\u0101ntar) and where the Sh\u0101h had formerly resided. From there he sent Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n to the Sh\u0101h, whose cort\u00e9ge had nearly reached its destination when Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n arrived. He conveyed his message and then returned from that stage\u2077 with joyful foot. Thereafter his Majesty proceeded to Sult\u0101niya. The Sh\u0101h was encamped between Abhar\u2078 and Sult\u0101niya. When his Majesty arrived near that residence the great officers came, one after the other, and paid their respects.

If Jauhar\u2019s account, Stewart 62, is to be trusted, Bair\u0101m had cause to be glad that he got away safely from the Sh\u0101h\u2019s presence.\n\u2078 B\u0101yazid says the meeting was in Zang\u0101n.

In Jum\u0101da-al-awwal, 951 (July, 1544), the Sh\u0101h himself welcomed him with all the observances of respect and honour, and had an interview with him in which all the conditions of reverence and veneration were fulfilled. In a noble palace, on the gilding of which skilful artists had long been engaged and in which they had displayed miracles of craftsmanship, an enchanting picture-gallery received its inauguration by the interview with his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. A regal assemblage took place, and in accordance with the canons of magnanimity and the requirements of condolence and exalted inquiries after welfare there was sympathy and mutual discourse. The gates of sincerity and honouring having been unclosed, those of sociability and gaiety opened of themselves, and high converse ensued.

Every failure and infirmity which hath in these days appeared in administration and world-rule arose from the disservice and discord of disloyal brothers. Over this you had no control. In mundane affairs fraternal unanimity is of high import, and is a disentangler of perplexities. In this present regard ourselves as your younger brother and know us to be a helper and a supporter, for\u2014our life on it\u2014we shall succour you to the height of your desire. We acknowledge old ties, and shall fulfil whatever assistance may be necessary. Should we be required to go in person as your auxiliary we will go.\" He spoke many sincere words and such as bore the impress of magnanimity. For several days they held Cyrus-like festivities. His Majesty the Shah entered personally into all the arrangements, and every day had a novel entertainment. There was increase of formal and spiritual beauty, and day by day he waxed more and more friendly and affectionate. How can feasts be described when so great a Shah was in his own person the caterer? What gold-embroidered velvet and silken canopies there were and what numbers of wrought pavilions and lofty tents there were!\n\nFar as the eye could reach, silken rugs and precious carpets were laid out and thereby were spread pleasure and joy. What account can be given of how in the important matter of the distribution of presents and rarities he gave his personal attention to the subject? How tell of the choice horses of Media with embroidered and golden saddles and the splendid housings and trappings, of the adorned mules of Bard'a, of the strangely shaped camels, male or female, with valuable coverings, of the many scimitars and daggers set with jewels and the like, of the fine linen, and the robes (p\u014dst\u012bn) of the marten (kesh) and the red fox, the ermine (sanj\u0101b), and\n\n1 Tahm\u0101sp was about eight years younger than Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\n2 T\u0101ja b\u0101f, a kind of silk, Blochmann 93.\n3 There is a play on words here.

Many basins, ewers, and candlesticks of gold and silver set with rubies and pearls, many gold and silver dishes, ornamented tents, grand carpets, the marvel of the age for size and beauty, and other regal articles were brought one by one before his Majesty's holy glance. Money and goods were distributed to all the followers, and royal courtesies were interchanged.\n\nHis Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni on the day of the great festival presented to the Sh\u0101h as the gift of a traveller a diamond of great value\u2014worth the revenues of countries and climes, together with 250 Badakhsh\u0101n rubies. Without a doubt, all the expenditure which the Sh\u0101h, whether from his privy purse, or through his officers, incurred on account of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni from the time of his entering the country to his exit therefrom was hereby repaid more than four times over. From thence they went to Sult\u0101niya and there held Cyrus-like festivities. In the intervals between these glorious seasons of fortunate conjunctions a cloudiness of heart was created on both sides through the instigation of sundry strife-mongers, but the turbidity did not last long, and was washed away by the waters of cleansing. His Majesty the Sh\u0101h made every day new arrangements for pleasure and joy. Among other things he ordered the amusement of a hunting-drive (shik\u0101r-i-qamargha), and his army drove the beasts of the plain a ten days' journey up to a spring known as the S\u0101v\u016bq Bul\u0101q which is the first stage of the Zail\u0101q Bil\u0101q.

Or. 153, p. 58b, says it was B\u0101bar's diamond, and that it weighed 6\u00bd miq\u0101ls, and that Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp afterwards sent it to Nig\u0101m Sh\u0101h ruler of the Deccan.\n4 Referring to Bahram Mirz\u0101, the Sh\u0101h's brother and also to some disloyal servants of Humayun. See Niz\u0101mudd\u012bn, Ferishta, Jauhar and also Bad\u0101oni I. 444.\n5 Bul\u0101q means a spring in T\u00fcrki. Perhaps the correct name is S\u0101j Bul\u0101q, i.e., the cold spring. This is near the Takht-i-Sulaim\u0101n which is mentioned by Jauhar as the scene of a hunt.\n6 Bil\u0101q means a garden and also\nMajesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and the Sh\u0101h entered the hunting-ground together and gave new lustre to the arts of horsemanship and gameslaying. After that Bahr\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101, S\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101, and after them Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad K\u014dk\u012b, Sh\u0101h Quli Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Muhrd\u0101r (seal-keeper, or chancellor), R\u014dsh\u0101n K\u014dka, \u1e24asan K\u014dka, and many others of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s trusty followers were permitted to enter the qamargha. Several of the Sh\u0101h\u2019s officers were bidden to enter, such as \u2018Abdall\u0101 Kh\u0101n Istajl\u016b, son-in-law of the great Sh\u0101h Isma\u2019il, Ab\u016bl Q\u0101sim Khalf\u0101, Siyundak Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, Q\u016brc\u012b B\u0101gh\u012b Afsh\u0101r, Badar Kh\u0101n Istajl\u016b and some others. After a time a general permission to enter was given. Everyone of the soldiers and troopers engaged in seizing and binding the game. Meanwhile Bahr\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101, who had a grudge against the Khalf\u0101 intentionally shot an arrow at him so that he died. Out of consideration for the M\u012brz\u0101 no one mentioned this to the Sh\u0101h. After this troops were sent away in order that a fresh qamargha might be made at Sulaim\u0101n\u2019s Pool (\u1e24auz-i-Sulaim\u0101n). When they assembled, hunting, more majorum, was resumed, and here they spent some time also in playing polo and in archery. On this day as the archery was keen (lit. the qabaq-\n\nan underground building used to avoid the heat.\n\n1 There seems some mistake here, for this man is mentioned by B\u0101yaz\u012bd as a servant of the Sh\u0101h. Blochmann has several Sh\u0101h Qulis, but none of them is entitled Sul\u1e6d\u0101n. A. F. however later on, I. 266 gives this title to the Sh\u0101h Quli who was Bair\u0101m\u2019s sister\u2019s son and became Kh\u0101n Jah\u0101n. But he can hardly be the Sh\u0101h Quli of the hunt for he had not then come from Qandahar. It would seem from B\u0101yaz\u012bd 176 that the person meant is \u1e24usain Quli brother of the Governor of S\u012bst\u0101n. B\u0101yaz\u012bd states that Hum\u0101y\u016bn made him his seal-keeper when at Qandahar.\n\n2 B\u0101yaz\u012bd calls him S\u016bndak.\n\n3 The Lucknow ed. has kush\u0101n, \u201ckilling.\u201d\n\n4 Cf.

Considering how easily an accident could occur (vide the story of Adrastus in Hero-dotus), and the dislike of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s party for Bahr\u0101m, who seems to have given his brother good advice about Hum\u0101y\u016bn, one feels inclined to think this charge of murder unfounded. B\u0101yaz\u012bd does not tax the M\u012brz\u0101 with it.

From\ndicted on account of riots, were revived by the Sh\u0101h's orders for his Majesty's delectation. His Majesty visited the splendid buildings, the memorials of ancient kings\u2014and the pleasure-parks of the city. Fresh illustrations were thereby brought to his mind of the bypast (guz\u0101\u0161t\u0101g\u0101n) monuments of the earth, of the revolutions (sargaz\u0161t\u0101g\u0101n), of the mansions of the skies, of the passing away (guz\u0101\u0161t\u0101g\u012b) of the inconstant universe, and of the breaches (guzist\u0101g\u012bh\u0101) of the unstable earth, and they brought to his lips truthful words about compassing the favour of the Creator. He became wrapt in some old verses, and in ecstacy he recited aloud this quatrain:\n\nQuatrain.\n\nAlas that substance hath slipped from the palm,\nAnd that many hearts (lit. livers) have bled at death's hand;\nNone cometh * from that (other) world that I might inquire\nHow it fared with the travellers thereto.\n\nMull\u0101 Qutb\u016b-d-din Jalanj\u016b of Bagdad waited upon him in this illustrious city and attended him as far as Holy Mashhad.

But from the hindrances of fate he could not accompany him. One of the wonderful good omens was this that when his Majesty came to Tabriz, as he was very keen about astrolabes, spheres\u00b9 (kura) and other instruments of observation, he bade his equerry Paik Mu\u1e25ammad search diligently in the city for spheres (kura). That simpleton brought some colts (karra) with their mothers!\u00b2 His Majesty was pleased and purchased them as a good omen. After leaving Tabriz he went to Ardabil. When he arrived at Shamm\u0101s\u012b\u00b3 all the Sh\u0101ikhz\u0101das and the other grandees and nobles came and paid their respects. He stayed a week in Ardabil and then went to Khalkh\u0101l\u2074 and from thence to T\u0101r\u0101m\u2075 and from thence to Kharazbil.\u2076 As the air and fruits of that place were remarkably excellent, especially the seedless\u2077 pomegranates, he remained there three days. In Sabzaw\u0101r he rejoined his camp. Here her Majesty Maryam-Mak\u0101n\u012b gave birth to a daughter.\u2078 From the beginning of his march towards K\u0101bul and Qandah\u0101r, at every stage that he came to, the rulers and grandees tendered presents and exercised hospitality.

From here he sent one 'Abdu-l-fattah Kurkir\u0101q\u00b9 to demand the subsidy\u00b2 (s\u0101wari) which had been assigned upon Her\u00e2t, and the latter died on his way back. From the same place he sent Maul\u0101n\u0101 N\u016bru-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Tarkh\u0101n to summon Shaikh Ab\u016b'l-q\u0101sim Jurj\u0101n\u012b and Maul\u0101n\u0101 Ily\u0101s of Ardabil who were adorned with external and internal excellencies. At K\u0101bul they came into his service. He was greatly pleased by the arrival of these two distinguished men with whom he discussed the Durratu-l-T\u0101j.\u00b3 And during the time he was in Mashhad he continually held discourses with the learned and eloquent who waited upon him and were benefited by the alchemy of his companionship, Maul\u0101n\u0101 Jamshid\u2074 the enigmatist, who was an aggregate of excellencies, repeatedly had the honour of visiting him. One day Mull\u0101 Hairat\u012b\u2075 presented the following to the amending glance of his Majesty:\n\nVerse.\n\nWhiles my heart, whiles my liver is consumed from love of the fair,\nEvery moment love makes a fresh scar;\nMy state is like that of the moth and the lamp,\nFor if I approach my wings (b\u0101l-\u016b-param) are burnt away.\n\nHis Majesty who was a genuine artist (khall\u0101q-i-ma'\u0101ni) and a paragon of acuteness, gave this excellent turn (ta\u1e63arruf) to it:\n\n\u00b9 This is the word which Blochmann was unable to explain satisfactorily, 72n. and 616. Here it is used as a title. Kurk means fur and ir\u0101q accoutrements. A. F. gives few dates in this part of his history. We learn from B\u0101yazid that Hum\u0101y\u0101n reached Mashhad at the end of Ramaz\u0101n, i.e., 15th December, 1544. From the inscription furnished by the lamented Mr. Ney Elias J. R. A. S. for January 1897, p. 47, it appears that Hum\u0101y\u0101n was at Turbat-i-J\u0101ma few days later, viz., on 29th December.\n\n\u00b2 \"Present dont en fait homaje.\" See Vullers and Quatrem\u00e8re, Not. et Extraits XIV. 27.\n\n\u00b3 \"Pearl of the diadem.\" It is an encyclopaedia of philosophical sciences by Qutbu-d-d\u012bn Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b a disciple of Na\u1e63\u012bru-d-d\u012bn \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b.

From Mashhad he went to the caravanserai of Tarq\u00b9 and from there he went by way of the fort of G\u0101h\u00b2 to S\u012bst\u0101n. Here the Prince and the Sh\u0101h's officers joined him. From thence they went to Garmsir. Mir 'Abdu-l-Hai of Garmsir came out of the fort of Laki\u00b3 with a quiver bound round his neck and did homage and excused himself for his offences and for his shameful conduct in remaining aloof from service on the occasion of his Majesty's march (into Persia). As his Majesty's disposition was forgiving and benevolent, he accepted his apologies and encompassed him with favours.\n\nSince the narrative has proceeded so far, it is indispensable that something should be said of the officers who served the State during their exile.\n\nThe head of the faithful servants was Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, who throughout waited on the stirrup of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b as if he were his good Fortune (c\u0101n sa'\u0101dat). The second was Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam who was the uterine\u2074 brother of her Majesty Maryam-Mak\u0101n\u012b. From the beginning of his career he was not free from turbulence of brain and heat of disposition. Gradually his forwardness (b\u012bb\u0101k\u012b) and bloody-mindedness (saff\u0101k\u012b) increased beyond bounds. His last action will be described in its proper place.

One would be glad to think that he was not the full brother.\n\u2075 His mother was Sh\u0101h Begam, the daughter of Sult\u0101n Husain of Her\u0101t by P\u0101yanda Sult\u0101n Begam.

H\u00e1ji Mu\u1e25ammad was of singular courage and the Sh\u0101h often said that kings stood in need of such a servant.

Though he was foster-brother of Kamr\u0101n Mirz\u0101 he was long in the service of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. He was of generous nature, affable, and a confidant.

He was ever assiduous in her service. He had two auspicious sons who were foster-brothers of the king of kings. One was Saif \u1e34h\u0101n, who drank the wholesome cup of martyrdom in the year of the conquest of Gujr\u0101t.

K\u0101mr\u0101n, and as the season of awakening and of contrition was past, he advanced further in evil ways, and gave way to wicked thoughts. In the first place he sent Khizr Kh\u0101n Haz\u0101ra\u2019s brother and Qurb\u0101n Qar\u0101walbeg\u012b (head of the vanguard) to bring the nursling of light, to wit, the Shahinshah from Qandah\u0101r to K\u0101bul. When they arrived M. \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b took counsel with his associates about sending his Majesty. All who were of sound sense said it was not right to send him and that when his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-ashiy\u0101n\u012b approached the proper thing to do was to send to him with all reverence the child of dominion so that by means of this fair nosegay of fortune\u2019s parterre he might obtain for himself forgiveness of his offences. Some others said it was proper to send him to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n so as not to lose his favour, for, as regarded the other suggestion, it was too late now for a reconciliation with his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. In the end the Mirz\u0101\n\n---\n\n1 There is a play here on Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s name. He is represented as casting his shadow over Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n like the Hum\u0101 or phoenix.\nput aside the sound advice and sent his Majesty Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h in the depth of winter, and in snow and ice to K\u0101bul. His sister Bakhshi B\u0101n\u016b Begam\\(^1\\) was sent with him, and also Shamsu-d-d\u012bn of Ghazn\u012bn who had received the title of Atka Kh\u0101n, M\u0101ham Anaga, mother of Adham Kh\u0101n, J\u012bj\u012b Anaga, mother of M. \u2018Az\u012bz K\u014dkalt\u0101sh and a number of other servants. In order that they might not be recognised, the nursling of light was called M\u012brak on this journey, and his sister B\u012bja.\\(^2\\) When they arrived at Qil\u0101t (Kelat-i-Ghilzai) they put up at night in the house of a Haz\u0101ra. Owing to the radiance (far) and majesty which were manifest on his Majesty\u2019s forehead, men recognised him as soon as they saw him, and in the morning there rose to the lips of the master of the house the statement that the prince had been brought there. As soon as Khizr Kh\u0101n\u2019s brother heard this remark he set off at once, and hurried on to Ghazn\u012bn. The attendants beheld, hour by hour, and moment by moment, notes of greatness in the prince from his earliest years and marvelled at the Divine Creation while watching the wondrous lights of his development. Among them was this that when they had marched from Ghazn\u012bn and had come to their halting-place, the lamp in the house went out and the place was in darkness. His Majesty, the essence of whose nature had affinity with light, fell a-weeping from horror of the darkness and though Anagas and nurses did their best they could not succeed in soothing him. But as soon as they brought a lamp his heart grew pacified, and the lights of joy showed themselves in his cheeks. This was a clear proof of light-augmenting and darkness-dispelling, both internally and externally. When his Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h came to K\u0101bul from Qandah\u0101r, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n brought that nursling of fortune\u2019s garden to the house of the cupola of chastity Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam, sister of her Majesty Giti-sit\u0101ni Fird\u016bsmak\u0101n\u012b.

K\u0101mr\u0101n beheld that true cypress of fortune\u2019s rosarium in the Shahr-\u0101r\u0101 garden he was, from the lucklessness of his fate, confused and astonished at the sight of that lustrous forehead whence streamed the glory of eternal dominion and success. And as God the world-adorner was willing the joy of the lord of dominion and the spiritual and temporal defeat of the M\u012brz\u0101, whatever the latter thought to be matters of his joy, proved to be materials of vexation. For instance, on a day when the M\u012brz\u0101 held a feast and had for his own glorification sent for his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h, it chanced that on the occasion of the Shab-i-Bar\u0101t\u00b9 they had, according to the custom, brought a decorated kettle-drum for his son Ibr\u0101h\u012bm M\u012brz\u0101.\u00b2 His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h took a fancy to it, in accordance with the principle that the orchestra of world-conquest must strike up in his name, and the drum of world-rule and universal adornment must give forth a loud sound on the roof of his residence. The uncomprehending M\u012brz\u0101 did not wish to let him have it, and reflecting that M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm was the elder of the two, and apparently the stronger, he made the taking of the drum a pretext for a trial of strength and a\n\n\u00b9 The night of record, 14 Sha'b\u0101n=for 952, 22nd October, 1545. Apparently the wrestling must have taken place long after Akbar was removed to K\u0101bul for that was in winter and so presumably in end of 1544 or beginning of 1545. But possibly Sha'b\u0101n 951 is meant, in which case the wrestling took place on 1st November, 1544. If this be so, however, Akbar must have been removed to K\u0101bul long before Hum\u0101y\u016bn had left Persia. There is an account in Herklots of the feasting, &c., on the Shab-i-bar\u0101t.\n\n\u00b2 One MS. has Ab\u016b'l-q\u0101sim, and Ferishta, lith. ed. p. 264, states that K\u0101mr\u0101n had one son Ab\u016b'l-q\u0101sim, and that Akbar imprisoned him in Gw\u0101ly\u0101r in 964 (1556), and afterwards put him to death at the time of the rebellion of Kh\u0101n Zam\u0101n in 1567.\nwrestling-match. Whoever conquered was to have the drum. His Majesty who was aided by heaven, and sustained from all eternity and who regarded not the pomp of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n nor the superior age of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Mirz\u0101, rejoiced on hearing the condition, imposed by the Mirz\u0101 for his own enjoyment, and became a means of augmenting the Mirz\u0101\u2019s sorrow. Despite his tender years, which made such actions very surprising, he, by Divine inspiration, and celestial teaching, without hesitation girt up his loins, and rolled up his sleeves, and with strong arm, which was strengthened by eternal power, stepped bravely forward. He grappled with Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Mirz\u0101 according to the canons of the skilful and of the masters of wrestling and putting his hand before his waist so lifted him up and flung him on the ground that a cry burst forth from the assemblage, and that shouts of Bravo arose from far and near. This was the beginning of the beating of that drum of victory and conquest of his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h, the Shadow of God, which came to be beaten above the loftiest pinnacles of earth, and beneath the green vault (\u1e63iphr-i-kh\u0101zr\u016b) of heaven. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n who had thought of this wrestling bout as a test of the issue of his contest with his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b took a bad omen from the result and became dejected, while the well-wishers and intimates of his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h expanded with joy and exulted at the happy omen. His Majesty beat the drum which he had gained by the strength of his arm, and the joyous sound gladdened the hearts of the royal servants. The Mirz\u0101, as things had turned out adversely, and the throw of the dice revealed an omen contrary to his desire, gave way to evil designs against the altar of fortune (Akbar), one of these being that he ordered his Majesty, who was still sucking, to be weaned. He was oblivious of the fact that he who drew milk from the breasts of the Divine favour and obtained nutriment from a celestial nurse could come to no harm from such acts, and that he who had the True Protector for his guardian could receive no detriment from these evil imaginings.\n\n1 Az baski \u1e6dar\u012bq shuda b\u016bd. For a similar phrase see p. 193 of text, l. 14.\n2 Akbar must have been then two, if not three years old, and surely it was time to wean a child who could lift up another child older and bigger than himself and cast him to the earth.\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nARRIVAL OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100NI JANNA\u1e6c-\u0100SH\u012aY\u0100N\u012a'S ARMY AT THE GARMS\u012aR AND THE TAKING OF THE FORT OF BAST.\n\nIt is not unknown to the observers of facts and contemplators of occurrences whose watchful eyes are open, and have been smeared with the antimony of alertness that when the lofty standards of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni and his Persian auxiliaries arrived at the Garms\u012br, \u2018Al\u012b Sult\u0101n Takl\u016b and a number of devoted men were sent to take Bast\u00b9 which belongs to the Garms\u012br and appertains to Qandah\u0101r.

K\u0101mr\u0101n had strengthened the fort which was now besieged by the royal army. In the course of the siege a musket ball from the fort struck \u2018Al\u012b Sult\u0101n and deprived him of life. His soldiers appointed his twelve years old son in his room and pressed forward the siege more and more. These facts were reported to the king of Persia and after some time there arrived a rescript ratifying the arrangement. Gradually the garrison got into straits and no help coming to them they begged for quarter. Owing to the imperial clemency they received this, and delivered up the fort. When it had come into the possession of the royal servants his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni encamped in the neighbourhood, and Sh\u0101ham \u00b2\u00b2\u2078 \u2018Al\u012b and M\u012br Khalaj tied quivers round their necks and came out and did homage. His Majesty in accordance with his innate benignity forgave their offences, and enrolled them among his servants.

Though his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had ascertained by truthful scouts that the report was false, and that M. 'Askar\u012b meditated to fight and to defend the fort of Qandah\u0101r, and moreover even on the supposition that the report was true his Majesty from his innate kindness was unwilling that 'Askar\u012b should be pursued, yet they brooked not restraint and having obtained a sort of permission to go they hurried off lest the Mirz\u0101 should escape them. When after making great haste they arrived in disorder at the environs of Qandah\u0101r, they found that the report of the Mirz\u0101's departure was false. A large body came out and fought with them, while cannon and muskets were discharged from the fort. A large number of Persians and others were killed, and many were wounded. Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam, Haidar Sult\u0101n, H\u00e1ji Mu\u1e25ammad, son of B\u0101b\u0101 Qushq\u0101, 'Al\u012b Quli, son of Haidar Sult\u0101n, Sh\u0101h Quli N\u0101ranj\u012b and a number of the Caghat\u0101is and Persians gave proofs of their courage and drove the enemy back to the Fort. Although Jamil Beg, one of Mirz\u0101 'Askari's trusted servants, sent a message to the Mirz\u0101 to come down in person as but a small force remained and that it would be easy to dispose of those who had once already been defeated, the Mirz\u0101 did not assent, and despatched a message to the effect that \"they know the numbers and quality of our men, and will not restrict their troops to the same number as before, on the contrary they probably have a reserve in hiding by whose help they will do for us. We shant let ourselves be gulled, but will make the fort strong, and not give battle till M. K\u0101mr\u0101n arrive.\" As God befriended the army of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n did not make his appearance, and some victories were obtained which were the prelude of countless successes. In these days B\u0101b\u0101 Sihrindi who was one of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n's distinguished officers, and who belonged to the Qandah\u0101r garrison was killed.\n\n1 b\u0113 jal\u016bt karda, not heeding the rein?\n2 Blochmann 480.\n3 B\u0101yazid tells us that he was a younger brother of B\u0101p\u0101s and that he was killed by a musket shot at the second siege of K\u0101bul.\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nARRIVAL OF THE ARMY OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100NI JANNAT-\u0100SH\u012aY\u0100NI AT QANDAH\u0100R, ITS SIEGE AND CAPTURE.\n\nWhen the heroes had gained such a victory his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni Jannat-\u0101sh\u012by\u0101ni returned thanks to God, and reached Qandah\u0101r five days after the joyful event on Saturday, 7th Mu\u1e25arram, 952 (21st March, 1545), in an auspicious hour which was compounded of favourable aspect. He halted by the side (dar zila') of the gate M\u0101sh\u016br and encamped in the garden of Shamsu-d-din \u2018Al\u012b the Q\u0101z\u012b of Qandah\u0101r. The batteries were allotted and the captains distributed. There were daily combats between the brave men on both sides. One day Haidar Sult\u0101n and his two sons \u2018Al\u012b Quli Kh\u0101n and Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, and Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018azzam drove the enemy from the front of Khw\u0101ja Khizr to the shrines near the old city and the barricade (k\u016bca band), and displayed great deeds. Haidar Sult\u0101n was in advance of all the others and the leader in the attacks. A remarkable circumstance was that B\u0101b\u016b D\u014dst Yasawal was standing with a number of men among the shrines and was shooting arrows. Haidar Sult\u0101n thought to slay him with his lance and raised his arm to do this, and at the same moment an arrow reached his armpit. Isma\u2018il Sult\u0101n of J\u0101m, whom M. K\u0101mr\u0101n had sent as an auxiliary, was standing on the white (\u0101qca) Tower which faces the tombs, beside M. \u2018Askar\u012b and was\n\n---\n\n1 Apparently the weavers' gate, m\u0101sh\u016br or m\u0101s\u016br meaning a weaver's reed or spindle.\n2 Afterwards the famous Kh\u0101n Zam\u0101n, Blochmann 319 and 328.\n3 This seems to be the name of a shrine. See Jarrett II. 404. B\u0101yaz\u012bd speaks of the d\u0101man-i-Khw\u0101ja Khizr.\n4 Perhaps what is meant is that it was a cul de sac.\n5 Apparently he was not severely wounded for we find him taking part in the expedition against Raff.

He deserted to Hum\u0101y\u016bn at Qandah\u0101r (B\u0101yaz\u012bd).\nwatching the fight. Though he was too far off to distinguish the features, he remarked that \"the man from whose hand the lance has fallen may be \u1e24aidar Sult\u0101n for once I went with \u2018Ubaidu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n\u00b9 to the city of T\u016bs, and \u1e24aidar Sult\u0101n and I were comrades\u00b2 in an attack and I lost these two fingers. From the mode of fighting I guess that this is he.\" When they brought in the lance afterwards his (\u1e24aidar\u2019s) name was found written on it. When they read it, they praised Isma\u2018\u012bl\u2019s conjecture. In this engagement many men of rank were wounded, the first of all to be wounded being Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018azzam, but who succeeded in returning. About this time news was brought that Raf\u012b\u2018 K\u014dka, the foster brother of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, was stationed\u00b3 behind a hill towards Zam\u012bnd\u0101war on the bank of the Arghand\u0101b with a force of Haz\u0101ras and Nakodars.\u2074 Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, Mu\u1e25ammad M\u012brz\u0101, \u1e24aidar Sult\u0101n, Maq\u1e63\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101 Akhtab\u0113g\u012b, the son of Zainu-d-din Sult\u0101n Sh\u0101ml\u016b and a number of others were sent against him. By good fortune Raf\u012b\u2018 K\u014dka was made prisoner, and great store of provisions, cattle and weapons was seized and the scarcity in the camp was changed to plenty. Other battles were also fought by the brave warriors with successful results.\n\nAs M. \u2018Askar\u012b had from his own backsliding let the thread of performance fall from his hand, and was persistently contumacious it occurred to his Majesty on account of his general benevolence and his fraternal affection that he should send to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n the Sh\u0101h\u2019s\u2075 letter together with an admonitory firm\u0101n of his own. Perchance he would awake from the sleep of neglect and take the straight road and by dint of good acts make reparation for his offences. In this way many persons might escape from unnecessary\n\n\u00b9 The great Shaib\u0101n\u012b\u2019s nephew and \u1e24aidar M.\u2019s brother-in-law. See Tar. Rash. 283. The battle was probably that fought between the Uzbegs and Persians at Z\u016br\u0101b\u0101d near J\u0101m on 25th September, 1528. B\u0101bar, Mem. 390 and 397 and Erskine\u2019s Hist. II. 491.\n\u00b2 The text has hamr\u0101h, but perhaps it should be hamr\u016b and the meaning be that Isma\u2018\u012bl encountered \u1e24aidar as an opponent. It is hardly likely that \u1e24aidar would be on the Uzbeg side. But perhaps the text means that Isma\u2018\u012bl was opposed to \u2018Ubaidu-l-l\u0101h.\n\u00b3 B\u0101yaz\u012bd has sangar (in an) entrenchment.\n\u2074 Jarrett II. 401n.\n\u2075 It appears from B\u0101yaz\u012bd that Bair\u0101m took to K\u0101mr\u0101n letters both from Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp and Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\ndestruction, and brotherly concord might result in great deeds which were brooding in his right-thinking soul. Accordingly Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n was despatched to K\u0101bul as an ambassador. When he reached the pass of R\u016bghni\u00b9 and the \u0100b-Ist\u0101da,\u00b2 which is between Qandah\u0101r and Ghazn\u012b a number of Haz\u0101ras blocked the way. At the close of the day there was an engagement and the king\u2019s servants were victorious and chastised the worthless Haz\u0101ras. Many of them were slain. When Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n arrived near K\u0101bul, B\u0101b\u016bs and many others came and welcomed him and took him with them. M. Kamr\u0101n held a reception in the Cah\u0101r B\u0101gh and sent for Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n. The latter rightly thought that it would not be proper to give the two rescripts to the M\u012brz\u0101 when he would doubtless be sitting down, and it was very unlikely that he would stand up and pay respect to them as was proper he should do. Having considered the matter, he took the Koran in his hand and tendered it as an offering. The M\u012brz\u0101 on seeing the Koran stood up out of reverence towards it, and at this moment Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n presented the two rescripts. Thus the device procured respect for them. The king\u2019s and the Sh\u0101h\u2019s gifts were duly presented and Bair\u0101m sitting down beside the M\u012brz\u0101 uttered words of truth and sincerity. At the close of the meeting he took leave to pay his respects to the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h. He also obtained permission to see M. Hindal, M. Sulaim\u0101n, Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 and Ulugh Beg M\u012brz\u0101. The M\u012brz\u0101 (Kamr\u0101n) dismissed him and appointed B\u0101b\u016bs to accompany him at the interview. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n first went to kiss the threshold of his Majesty the king of kings who was in the b\u0101gh-i-maktab (school-garden) with that cupola of chastity Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam, elder sister of his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b. M\u0101ham Bega who was his Majesty\u2019s nurse (anaga) brought out the nursling of Divine light from the inner chambers. The visitors performed\u00b3 their obeisance, and acquitted themselves of their embassy to him. It was a great joy to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n and his companions to have the privilege of beholding his auspicious Majesty. The witnessing of the divine lights which were manifest on\n\n\u00b9 I cannot find this pass.\n\u00b2 I.e., standing or stagnant water. It is a salt-lake south of Ghazn\u012b, I. G.

He gives more details, for he was one of the party.\nhis Majesty's forehead glorified their vision, and they returned thanks to Providence. Taking leave from them they went and visited M. Hind\u0101l who was in the house of his respected mother Dild\u0101r Begam and was under surveillance. They presented to him a gracious firm\u0101n, a robe of honour and a horse. With like ceremonies they next day visited M. Sulaim\u0101n\u00b9 and M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm who had been imprisoned in the fort in the house of Q\u0101sim\u00b2 Mukhlis. On that day they were by M. K\u0101mr\u0101n's orders brought out from there into the garden of Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Beg which is near the Shahr-\u0100r\u0101\u00b3 garden. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n embraced these two grandees in that garden and gladdened them by conveying to them the gifts and favours of the king and the Sh\u0101h. Taking leave from them he went to jalka\u2074 Siy\u0101h Sang, where Y\u0101dg\u0101r Na\u1e63\u012br had settled, and gave him hopes of the pardon of his offences, and the forgetting of his faults, and of his receiving various royal favours. In like manner he visited and conveyed hopes to Ulugh\u2075 M\u012brz\u0101 and other grandees, and gave them, as was proper, soothing messages. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n kept Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n under surveillance for more than a month, having neither the strength to resist, nor the grace to submit. He remained in these perplexities, until after hundreds of solicitations he let him (Bair\u0101m) go after a month and a half. He also by entreaties prevailed upon her Highness Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam to go to Qandah\u0101r ostensibly to persuade M. 'Askar\u012b, who, he pretended, was not under his influence, to make over Qandah\u0101r to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b's servants, but in reality in order that if things should go ill with him, who was holding out, and was maintaining the fort under M. K\u0101mr\u0101n's orders, and he should have to give up the fort, that cupola of chastity might\n\n\u00b9 It appears from B\u0101yaz\u012bd that one reason for visiting Sulaim\u0101n was to give him a letter from the king of Persia, and also to explain the fate of the horse which Tahm\u0101sp had sent him.\n\n\u00b2 K\u0101mr\u0101n's artillery-officer (B\u0101ya-z\u012bd).\n\n\u00b3 Jarrett, II. 404.\n\n\u2074 See Vullers 525a.

If Bair\u0101m spoke soothingly to him with Hum\u0101y\u016bn's consent, it seems base and treacherous of the latter to have put Y\u0101dg\u0101r to death shortly after his submission.\n\n\u2076 Blochmann, 461, 462. He was a Timuride, a son of M. Sult\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101 and grandson of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain of Her\u0101t.\nbe an intercessor for M. 'Askari and might procure him his liberty. As M. 'Askari had left the right path and in his devotion to M. K\u00e2mr\u00e2n had given up the rein of intention to the hand of rebellion and hostility, he applied himself to strengthening the fort, and placed guns and muskets all over it. The fort too was very strong, for it was of mud and so the breaching (qila' \u016b qama') of it was very difficult. The breadth of the wall was sixty yards \\(^1\\) (gaz). Though the heroes of the victorious army were few in number, yet they strove manfully so that the Turkomans were astonished, and became jealous of them.\n\nOne day his Majesty Jah\u00e2nb\u00e2ni had a select party, and there his confidential intimates opened the door of recitals and took into their hands the thread of narrative. The assembly became delightsome from the flow of pleasing anecdotes and joyous tales. By the elixir of the words of the brave the coin of the courageous was tested and increased, and a stock of valour accrued to those whose supply was small. On this occasion there came to his mind the loving remembrance of his Majesty the Sh\u00e2h\u00eensh\u00e2h. What may be the condition of this young cypress of the stream of the Caliphate, separated now from friends and surrounded by foes? And what are the thoughts of the envious, the foolish and the evil-minded about this auspicious rose-bush? With a heart rent in twain and a soul divided 'twixt hope and fear, he opened the hand of supplication before the great Temple which granteth the desire of the afflicted and distressed and prayed for the happiness and long life of that goodly tree of the Sultanate. In this way he relieved his blistered heart.\n\nVerse.\n\nLord: keep Thou this royal pearl\nFar from the molestation of the wicked,\nGrant him water from wisdom's stream,\nGrant him heat from perception's sun.\n\nThe sun hath trod many circuits in heaven\nThat this Light might issue from the veil,\nMany a star hath displayed benign aspects\nThat this Moon might put aside his locks.\n\n\\(^1\\) So in all MSS. apparently, but perhaps A. F. wrote sh\u00e2sh (6) and not sh\u00e2st (60).\nHigh Heaven trod many a round\nThat the horizons might share in this light,\nMay eternal splendour be his portion\nMay his lightsome heart ne'er be darkened!\n\nAnd in order to comfort his capacious soul he called for the horoscope which is the guarded tablet of mysteries of the fortune-favoured one and carefully perused it. In that frontispiece of auspiciousness he read personal safety, long life, ascension of the grades of fortune, ruin of enemies, and failure of the evil and crooked thoughted. Joyfully lifting up his head he exclaimed \"God be praised, my heart is wholly at rest from these anxieties. There is hope that bye and bye I shall be made happy by a sight of that divine nursling, and shall, by the star of that auspicious one become victorious over all my foes.\" Having returned thanks to God he set himself to conquer the fort. M. 'Askari used all diligence in holding it, and made changes in the garrisons of the batteries every day and every night, lest proffers of reconciliation should be made by the besiegers and there should thus be less vigilance on the part of the defence.\n\nAs the siege was protracted, and none of the king's servants came and joined him, the Persian officers relaxed their exertions and meditated a return home. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b read this design in their demeanour, and redoubled his efforts to take the fort. One night he moved out from his battery, and approaching the gate from the side of old Qandah\u0101r\u2014the place is called Cah\u0101r Dara\u2014he came within a stone throw of it, and there established a battery. Next morning when the Turkom\u0101ns saw this, they felt encouraged to take the fort, and they all moved forward; and narrowed the lines of circumvallation. M. 'Askari was astonished, and showed signs of despair, and besought with many entreaties that as the cupola of chastity (Kh\u0101nz\u0101da) was approaching, he might have a respite till her arrival so that he might be reassured by her and might be enabled to serve (Hum\u0101y\u016bn). He sent his petition through Mir\n\n---\n\n1 The passage is rather obscure, but I think the word m\u016brcal in the last part of the sentence must refer to the siege-batteries.

His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, who was a mine of liberality and clemency, accepted his prayer and stayed the siege-operations for some days. The wicked Mirz\u0101 outwardly assumed the airs of a suppliant, but secretly exerted himself to strengthen the fort, and when her Highness and Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n arrived he renewed his opposition. Though the noble lady endeavoured to restrain M. \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b from evil designs and to induce him to kiss the holy threshold, he from his disordered brain would not accept her counsels, but continued obdurate and would not suffer her to leave the fort and go to his Majesty\u2019s camp. Thus the Mirz\u0101\u2019s contumacy and villainy were revealed even to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. Relying therefore on the favour of God, who is the surety of those who commend themselves to Him, he strenuously endeavoured to take the fort. Meanwhile Ulugh Mirz\u0101, son of Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n Mirz\u0101, who was descended from Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain through a daughter, Sher-afkan\u00b9 Beg, son of Q\u016bc Beg, and Fa\u1e63\u0101l Beg, brother of Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n, Mir Barka and Mirz\u0101 \u1e24asan\u00b2 Kh\u0101n, sons of Mir \u2018Abdull\u0101h, who belonged to the Saiyids the Bani-mukht\u0101rs of Sabzaw\u0101r, and many others came from K\u0101bul by the guidance of a happy star and did homage. The cause of their escaping was this. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was keeping Ulugh Beg in confinement, and out of precaution he made him to a different custodian every week. When it came to Sher-afkan\u2019s turn, it happened that he too was afraid of the Mirz\u0101. He joined with the others and brought out Ulugh Mirz\u0101, and enjoyed the blessing of service. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b received this party with favour and gave them robes of honour, and assigned Zamin D\u0101war to M. Ulugh Beg. Though Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sult\u0101n came out with them, he lost his way one night and fell among the Haz\u0101ras. After some days and after being robbed he arrived on foot and with blistered soles. His Majesty remarked to him \u201cThere must have been something wanting in your loyalty for you to have lost your way and become involved in such troubles.\u201d After that Dawa\u00b3 Beg Haz\u0101ra came in with his tribesmen. Petitions too arrived from the K\u0101bul officers. The arrival of this party, and the receipt of petitions from officers and nobles caused great joy in the camp. The Qizilb\u0101sh\u012b,\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann, 455.\n\u00b2 Blochmann, 439.\n\u00b3 See Erskine, the text has Dada.\n(Persians) who had been uneasy in their minds, became tranquil and displayed alacrity in carrying on the war while the leaders of the garrison began to waver, and the foot of firmness slipped from the battlement of defence. The dwellers in the fort wrote daily accounts of M. \u2018Askari and shot them down from the walls. Their purport was that the garrison was in difficulties, and that the besiegers should press on, and not relax their efforts. At last it came to this that the officers of M. \u2018Askari\u2019s army flung themselves out of the fort one by one, and that the gunners and infantry did the same. First, Khizr Khwaja Khan threw himself down from the fort in the vicinity of his Majesty\u2019s battery, and seizing the collar of supplication with the hand of contrition fell at the holy feet of his Majesty Jahangiri. After him Muayyad Beg let himself down by ropes from the fort, and was exalted by doing homage. Then Isma\u2019il Beg, who was one of Giti-sitani Firdus-makani\u2019s officers and was distinguished for counsel and courage arrived, and Abu\u2019l-Husain Beg, brother\u2019s son of Qaraqa Khan, and Munawwar Beg, son of Nur Beg, came with him. One night Khizr Khan Hazara flung himself down from the fort, and two or three Hazaras took him on their backs and went off with him towards Kot Laka (?). Inasmuch as the work of defence had got out of hand, and M. \u2018Askari could neither make up his mind to remain in the fort, nor had he the face to come to the world-protecting Court, Khizr Khan Hazara desired to betake himself to the cell of safety and to come to strive out of these dangers. In the morning news came to the camp that he had left the fort and taken to flight. A number of people hastened to search for him. He had gone some distance and then hidden himself behind a rock. Some reliable persons relate that Khizr Khan Hazara used to tell how the men who had been sent to catch him passed close to him and how once a man touched the skirt of his garment and thought it was an animal, while\n\n1 Bartaf/land, explained by Erskine as meaning the fastening of letters to arrows and then shooting them down.\n\n2 Also called Khizr Khan Sultan. He was husband of Gulbadan the daughter of Babar and authoress of Memoirs.\n\n3 According to Nigamu-d-din he was a prisoner in Qandahar. He died shortly after the taking of Kabul to the great joy of everybody, says Bayazid, as they regarded him as a Satan and the cause of Humayun\u2019s losing India.\n\n4 One of Babar\u2019s officers. Mem. 424, 425.\nKhizr Kh\u0101n held his breath from fear. When night came on he emerged from under the rock and reached a place of safety.\n\nAs the daily increasing success of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was patent, and it became clear to the garrison that owing to the good fortune of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and the zeal of his devoted servants it would be impossible to maintain the defence, M. \u2018Askar\u012b awoke from the sleep of carelessness and became disturbed in his mind, and could neither advance nor stay where he was. At first he asked to be allowed to surrender Qandah\u0101r and to proceed to Kabul, but his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b did not agree to this, and the Mirz\u0101\u2019s crude idea came to nought. Out of necessity he had to send her Highness Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam to his Majesty to beg forgiveness of his offences. At the request of that cream of chastity\u2019s family the writing of forgiveness was drawn over the register of his offences, and on Thursday, 25th Jum\u0101da-l-\u0101khir (3rd September, 1545), of that year (952) he came out of the fort, contrite and repentant, and in the train of the cupola of chastity. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had formed an assemblage in the d\u012bw\u0101nkhana and the Caghat\u0101i and Persian officers were drawn up in line according to their rank. In accordance with the royal orders Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n hung the sword round M. \u2018Askar\u012b\u2019s neck and introduced him. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, in spite of all the mortal injuries which he had received from him, put aside the canons of sovereignty and with native kindness and excessive clemency accepted the intercession of the cupola of chastity and drawing the pen of forgiveness over the schedule of his deeds, he encompassed him with the curtains of favour and with exceeding affection. After returning thanks to God for this beginning of success, he gave orders for the removal of the sword from the Mirz\u0101\u2019s neck, and after he had paid his respects bade him be seated. After that Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Jal\u0101ir, Sh\u0101ham Kh\u0101n, Muq\u012bm Kh\u0101n, Sh\u0101h Quli Sist\u0101n\u012b, T\u016blak Kh\u0101n Q\u016brc\u012b and others to the number of thirty persons were brought forward with swords and quivers round their necks\u00b9 to make their obeisance. Out of these 236 Muq\u012bm Kh\u0101n and Sh\u0101h Quli Sist\u0101n\u012b were ordered into confinement with fetters\u00b2 on their legs and wooden boards on their necks.\n\n\u00b9 Nig\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn says they carried their shrouds in their hands.\n\u00b2 Z\u016bl\u0101na i. q., z\u0101wal\u0101na. See Burh\u0101n-i-Q\u0101ti\u2018 under Z\u016bl\u0101na and Vullers under z\u0101wal\u0101na.\nFrom the close of day up to early dawn, which is the time of the arrival of the glory of heaven, there was a delightful assembly. Instructive events were described, and Mir Qalandar and other reciters and players discoursed excellent music, thereby removing the rust from his Majesty\u2019s world-adorning soul. During the assembly they in accordance with his Majesty\u2019s orders presented M. \u2018Askari with an exact copy of the letter which he had written to his Baluci followers at the time when his Majesty was proceeding to a strange land by way of the desert. The Mirz\u0101\u2019s life was embittered, and mirth became melancholy. At last, out of necessity an order was given that he should be kept under surveillance, and that he should be brought from time to time to make his obeisance so that while his offences had, out of innate kindness, been forgiven, he might for some days take counsel with himself in bondage. Next day the night-illumining crescent of victory lighted up those who sat darkling in the citadel. Mu\u1e25ammad Mur\u0101d Mirz\u0101 and the Caghat\u0101i and Persian officers came to the city in attendance on his Majesty. For three nights and days the city was brightened by the light of his Majesty\u2019s august advent, and was in peace and tranquillity. On the fourth day it was, in accordance with the secret workings of his Majesty\u2019s comprehensive mind, presented to Mu\u1e25ammad Mur\u0101d Mirz\u0101, and his Majesty took up his quarters in the C\u0101r B\u0101gh of his Majesty Fird\u016bsmak\u0101n\u012b, which is on the bank of the Arghand\u0101b, and was refreshed by its pleasant groves. In that charming spot the official accountant laid before him a detailed list of the properties of M. \u2018Askari, which had been brought together from all quarters, but his Majesty did not regard them as worthy of consideration and distributed them among those of his brave soldiers who were in want.\n\nWhen M. K\u0101mr\u0101n heard of the conquest of Qandah\u0101r and of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s coming against K\u0101bul, he was agitated and troubled, and had his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h brought from the house of the cupola of chastity Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam to his own, and made him over to his chief wife Kh\u0101nam Begam. He also confined Shamsu-d-d\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Ghaznav\u012b, commonly called Atka Kh\u0101n, in an unworthy place, and took counsel with his officers as to what he should do with M. Sulaim\u0101n. Mull\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-Kh\u0101liq, who was K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s teacher, and B\u0101b\u016bs, who had charge of political affairs, advised that the Mirz\u0101 should be dealt gently with and be allowed\nto go to Badakhshan so that he might be useful in time of need. Fortunately for M. Sulaiman it happened that Mir Nazar Ali, Mir Hazar Teshkani, Mir Ali Baluc, and others had combined a few days before and had seized Fort Zafar, and put Qasim Barlas and other officers into confinement. They sent a message to M. Kamaran that if he sent M. Sulaiman, they would make over Badakhshan to him, otherwise they would put their prisoners to death and hand over the country to the Uzbegs. Accordingly Mirza Sulaiman and Ibrahim and Haram Begam were sent off to Badakhshan. When they had got as far as Pai Minar and Ma'mura village, M. Kamaran repented of having let M. Sulaiman go and sent persons to recall him, alleging that he had something to say to him. M. Sulaiman suspected this message and wrote a letter of excuse in reply to the effect that as he had taken leave in an auspicious hour, it was not proper to return, and that he trusted M. Kamran would be so kind as to write to him what he wished to confer about and to send the letter by a confidential servant when he would act in accordance therewith. Meanwhile he hastened on to Badakhshan. As soon as he reached Badakhshan he broke his agreement. At this time too Yadgar Nasir Mirza fled from Kabul towards Badakhshan. And as fate desired that M. Kamaran should receive the recompense of his deeds, the materials for this were being prepared daily. Of the Mirzas no one remained with him except Hindal. Him he flattered and appointed to pursue and capture Yadgar Nasir, promising him that he would give him one-third of all he now possessed or should afterwards acquire, on condition that he should not deviate in any way from loyalty and fraternal feeling. Having made this compact he sent off the Mirza whom he had kept under surveillance. M. Hindal, who had been brought into difficulties by Kamaran's ill treatment verbally agreed for he regarded his escape from his claws as a great relief. But when he came to Pai Minar, he under a wise guidance proceeded towards his Majesty Jahangiri. M. Kamaran was astonished on hearing of this affair, and lost the thread of his counsel. He had no servants or companions who would consult his welfare or tell him the truth.\n\n1 According to Bayazid, p. 16a, Sulaiman was released before the fall of Qandahar. He also says that his wife Haram or Khurram Begam bribed the officers with her jewels to advise his release.\nMost of his servants had their eyes veiled, and the vision of their intelligence was troubled by the ophthalmia of neglect. They beheld not the way of salvation nor the straight path. Those who did see what was proper, had not the power to express their sentiments. This was due to two circumstances:\u2014(1) Some had not the courage to make representations. (2) Some were of such a nature that they studied the temper of the Mirz\u00e2, and did not consider truthful representations advisable, for they were certain that from his self-sufficiency he would not accept good advice, but would be displeased on the mere mention of it. And his displeasure would cause injury to the influence and position of the speaker. The condition of fidelity is that in such matters one should not delay or have regard to one\u2019s language, nor spend one\u2019s time in negligence or delay. For the evil of this falls in the end upon all, and is as ruinous to the general prosperity. And the results of treacherous counsel, which is the greatest and worst of treacheries, come forth. And the mole of untrustworthiness and flattery, which is the blackness\\(^1\\) of disloyalty and unpropitiousness, reveals itself on the cheek of their procedure. It behoves such men, if they feel afraid of not suppressing the truth or of uttering honest but disagreeable remonstrances to recognise the fact that such opportunities are part of their good fortune, and to rejoice thereat, and not to let the wrinkle of contraction form in the forehead of frankness. For though in appearance the great may be disgusted, yet in reality the noble mind approves of hearing both sides. And though such advisers may appear to run counter to the opinion of their masters, yet in fact they will at once be relieved from responsibility and have discharged the duty of good service, and also be lauded in word and deed by those who consider the end and regard the final termination. M. K\u00e2mr\u00e1n, in fact, went from blunder to blunder from want of warning wisdom, and the absence of sound counsellors.\n\n\\(^1\\) Nil. lit. blueness, blue being the colour of mourning and misfortune.\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nMARCH OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100NI JANNA\u1e6c-\u0100SH\u012aY\u0100NI'S ARMY FROM QANDAH\u0100R TO CONQUER K\u0100BUL, AND VICTORY OVER THAT TERRITORY.\n\nWhen his Majesty was freed from anxiety about Qandah\u0101r he placed before himself the conquest of K\u0101bul, and with this intention left his Majesty Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101ni's garden and halted at the Gumbaz Safed (the white dome) above the shrine of \u1e24asan Abd\u0101l. The thought of the expedition continually occupied his mind, and he was perpetually holding conferences about it with far-sighted loyalists and devoted friends. Many of the Persians were wearied of their long expatriation and went off without leave, while some departed after obtaining leave by importunity. Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n and the others who were in attendance on the Sh\u0101h's son opened, from want of consideration, the hand of tyranny and oppression over the subject population, and thought of increasing their own substance by such unhallowed proceedings. High and low used to come from the city, imploring justice, and his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni was in a difficulty for if he were to rebuke the oppressors, the Sh\u0101h would be vexed, while, if he did not execute justice, the hand of the unjust would not be withdrawn from the subjugated, and this would call down the Divine displeasure. As the time was not convenient, he remained perturbed, and put off remedying the evil till another season.\n\nWhen the expedition to K\u0101bul had been determined upon he was compelled to ask Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n\u00b9 for accommodation for some of his ladies and for his goods and chattels. He candidly acknowledged that in accordance with his promise he had made over Qandah\u0101r to the Persians, but said that he could not set the foot of resolve\n\n\u00b9 The name seems Turkish and is also spelt B\u016bd\u0101q. See Blochmann 371, but the person there mentioned is probably not the Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n of the text.\nin the stirrup of toil until he had disposed of his people, and his mind were at ease concerning them. Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n in his ignorance of affairs made objections and unlike a wise man was neither alert in carrying out the Sh\u0101h\u2019s orders, nor in obeying the king\u2019s mandate, which was the root of the matter. The chief officers represented that they had a great enterprise in hand, and that there was nothing for it but to seize Qandah\u0101r. They would thus undertake whatever was before them with a light heart. His Majesty referred to the kindnesses of the Sh\u0101h and declined to vex the latter\u2019s servants, and thought they must submit to their unreasonable conduct. He began to consider if he should go to Badakhsh\u0101n and should join M. Sulaim\u0101n to himself before attacking K\u0101bul. But as a strong motive for haste in conquering K\u0101bul was his desire to behold the Shah\u012bnsh\u0101h and to share to the full in that light of the garden of the Khilafat, knowing that by heaven\u2019s decree all providential victories depended on the auspicious existence of that splendour, his eager desire to attain that object revealed itself from time to time. Just then the Sh\u0101h\u2019s son became a beholder of the gardens (riy\u0101z) of mercy, and a visitor of the pools (hiy\u0101z) of pardon (i.e., he died). The confidential officers represented that winter was at hand, and that it was impossible for them to convey the women and children and the baggage (part\u0101l) along with them into the hill-country. The Sh\u0101h\u2019s son was dead, and it was not right to leave Qandah\u0101r to the Turkam\u0101ns, especially when they were so headstrong and were by their tyranny ruining the country and casting down the pillars of peace. Moreover, though they had been commissioned to bind constantly the girdle of service on their souls\u2019 waist, and to serve continually the sublime expedition they had been perverse and been drunken with the wine of negligence, and had not shown zeal in submitting to orders. On the contrary they had transgressed the supreme commands, and had openly and secretly gone into opposition and had suspended over their countenances the veil of shamelessness. It behoved his Majesty to shorten their oppressive\n\n1 Mard\u0101n-i-khud, meaning his harem.\n\n2 Perhaps referring to Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s project of marching into Badakhsh\u0101n, but more probably to the hills north of Qandah\u0101r through which they would have to march to K\u0101bul as Ghazn\u012bn was still in the hands of the enemy.\narms so that they should not reach the skirt of the poor and needy in this city which was the first fruit of the Divine favour. God forbid that such a proper design should produce a cloud in the mind of the Sh\u0101h. Inasmuch as it was a long march to K\u0101bul and the Haz\u0101ra and Afgh\u0101ns were more numerous than ants or locusts, and as they (the Persians) were stumbling-blocks in their path, and above all, as they were intriguing\\(^1\\) with M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, the first thing to do was to get hold of a refuge so that their minds should be at rest. At this moment there was no place better for this purpose than Qandah\u0101r. It was therefore in accordance both with reason and justice that Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n be told that he must, nolens volens, give up Qandah\u0101r. If he did not comply, the city must be besieged and taken possession of; and let a loving letter be written to the Sh\u0101h, explanatory of the facts of the case and the necessities of the position, and replete with candour and friendship. As the noble Sh\u0101h was a mine of wisdom and justice he would regard the transaction as one to be approved of. The leading spirit in this matter was H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad, the son of B\u0101b\u0101 Qushqa. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b said \u201cI admit it all, but \u2019twere base to lay siege to the place, to unsheathe the sword of battle, and to put a whole party to death. Though they \u2019ve left the path of moderation (i\u02bftid\u0101l), I do not approve of immoderation (b\u0113-i\u02bftid\u0101l) on the part of my servants. If this course be taken Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n\u2019s men will perish, and such a result will look ill in the eyes of good men. It is much better that you devise some plan whereby we may get possession of the fort without war or tumult.\u201d Accordingly he sent a messenger to Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n, with the request that as they were marching against K\u0101bul he would keep M. \u2018Askari in prison in Qandah\u0101r so that his Majesty\u2019s mind might be at rest. Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n thought the proposal advantageous to himself and agreed to it. It was arranged that the courageous heroes of the battlefield should proceed to the environs of Qandah\u0101r and lie in ambush there and then suddenly, when they got an opportunity, should enter the fort. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n and a body of troops were told off for the Gandig\u0101n\\(^2\\) Gate,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) I think these two clauses must refer to the Persians though there does not appear to be any evidence that they were plotting with K\u0101mr\u0101n.\n\n\\(^2\\) The text has Kandik\u0101n but probably the gate was named after the village of Gandig\u0101n W. of the modern city of Qandah\u0101r, and the battle-field\nwhile Ulugh Mirz\u0101, \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad and another body of troops were deputed to the M\u0101sh\u016br Gate, and Muayyad Beg and others were stationed near the New Gate. Those tigers of the jungle of courage made a rapid night-march and lay in ambush near Qandah\u0101r. When the \"true dawn\" appeared \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad presented himself before all the others at the M\u0101sh\u016br Gate. By chance some forage-camels were going in; he advanced under their cover, and tiger-like suddenly entered the gate. The warder saw him and challenged him. He said that he was bringing M. 'Askari by Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n's orders so that he might be confined in the Fort. This pretext did not avail, and the warder was about to shut the gate when \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad severed his arm with a blow of his sword. Some others came up from behind, and all the Persians who were there, and offered battle, were killed. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n entered by the Gandig\u0101n Gate, and the Fort came into the possession of the King's servants. The Persians fled and took refuge in the citadel. At midday his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b arrived and having entered by the Gandig\u0101n Gate took post at the \u0100qca (white) bastion. Thus that fortunate city became by the glory of his arrival an alighting stage of peace and tranquillity and a station of justice and beneficence. All, small and great, raised paeans of joy at this happy advent. Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n came forward, through the intervention of Haidar Sult\u0101n, and paid the homage of ashamedness and apologised for his offence. His Majesty encompassed him with princely favours and dismissed him. He made over the city to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n and wrote to the Sh\u0101h that as Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n had acted contrary to the Sh\u0101h's orders, and been slack in his duty, he had taken Qandah\u0101r from\n\nof 1st September, 1880. Lord Roberts' 41 years in India II. 368, Map.\n\n1 Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n, I. 130, has a more detailed account of the stratagem.\n\n2 A. F. compares \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad to a tiger stalking his prey.\n\n3 Elphinstone has some just remarks on Hum\u0101y\u016bn's treachery and A. F.'s canting defence thereof. But he is not correct in saying that the people of Qandah\u0101r had never been subject to Hum\u0101y\u016bn. He was certainly their suzerain through his brothers, and he was justified in regarding all Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n as belonging to his family from the day of his father's conquest. B\u0101d\u0101oni I. 447 gives four reasons for taking Qandah\u0101r from the Persians, and as may be supposed, he is more vigorous and more to the point than the lumbering A. F.\nhim and made it over to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n who was a dependant of the Sh\u0101h.\n\nMeanwhile M. \u2018Askar\u012b, unmindful of the royal clemency, and of his life\u2019s having been spared made his escape. After some days an Afgh\u0101n came and reported that the Mirz\u0101 was in his house, and asked that someone might be sent to seize him, but without letting it be known from whom the information came. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b appointed Sh\u0101h Mirz\u0101 and Khw\u0101ja \u2018Ambar N\u0101gir and they brought him out of the Afgh\u0101n\u2019s house from under a woolen carpet (pal\u0101s), and conducted him to the Presence. His Majesty from his innate clemency, and his observance of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bsmak\u0101n\u012b\u2019s testament which was made for all mankind and especially for the brothers, forgave anew his crimes and faults and made him over to Nad\u012bm Kokalt\u0101sh who was one of his Majesty\u2019s special confidants. He divided the territory of Qandah\u0101r among his officers. Tiri he gave to Ulugh Mirz\u0101, and the pargunas of Lah\u016b he assigned to H\u0101ji Muhammad for his maintenance. Zamin D\u016bwar was given to Isma\u2018il Beg, Qil\u0101t to Sherafkan, Sh\u0101l to Haidar Sult\u0101n. In this manner all the officers got j\u0101girs appropriate to their positions. Khw\u0101ja Jal\u0101lu-d-din Mahm\u016bd, who had committed extortion in the city on M. \u2018Askari\u2019s men and on others, was delivered over to M\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b.\n\n1 Ta\u2018alluq bash\u0101h d\u0101rad. Bair\u0101m was a Turkoman and a persona grata with Tahm\u0101sp. But perhaps the meaning is \u201cthe city remains dependent on the Sh\u0101h.\u201d\n\n2 The reference as to B\u0101bar\u2019s dying request that Hum\u0101y\u016bn would always forgive his brothers.\n\n3 The author of a MS. life of Akbar in the possession of Colonel Hanna, and who, as a grandson of \u2018Az\u012bz K\u014dka and great-grandson of J\u012bj\u012b Anagn, was likely to know, states that Nad\u012bm was the husband of the famous M\u0101ham Anagn.\n\n4 N.

The allusion to Jal\u0101lu-d-din is puzzling for he was in Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s service. But he had once been \u2018Askari\u2019s servant and perhaps he abused his opportunities when the troops entered Qandah\u0101r. Erskine\u2019s paraphrase of the passage in his history hardly agrees with the text.\n\n8 No doubt Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b Tagh\u0101\u012b, the maternal uncle of Hum\u0101y\u016bn, and who afterwards was governor of K\u0101bul.\nWhen the holy heart was relieved of the affairs of Qandah\u0101r, and when, by the blessing of Divine aid, and by the royal efforts, destiny and deliberation had come into accord (taq\u012br mu\u02bf\u0101fiq-i-tadb\u012br \u0101mad), he in an auspicious hour left her Majesty Maryam-mak\u0101n\u012b in Qandah\u0101r and addressed himself to the subduing of K\u0101bul. One of the endless bounties and unexpected favours was that a large caravan had come from Hindust\u0101n and the merchants had made good bargains by purchasing \u2018Ir\u0101q horses from the Turkomans (the Persian auxiliaries of Hum\u0101y\u016bn). As the lights of prestige were streaming from the cheek of circumstance, the leaders of the caravan came and represented that if their horses were taken into the service of the grand army and an order be given for payment after the conquest of Hindust\u0101n they would be greatly pleased and would feel that they were fortunate. \u201cGlorious will be our fortune,\u201d they said, \u201cif by giving this aid we may come to be numbered among the loyalists of the sublime dynasty.\u201d His Majesty Jah\u0101ub\u0101n\u012b regarded the proposition as a heavenly aid, and a providential contribution, and having acceded to their request, he ordered that purchase-bonds for the horses should be written out at the rates desired by the vendors and be given to them. He himself came to the ridge near B\u016bb\u0101 \u1e24asan Ab\u1e0d\u0101l and ordered Ulugh Mirz\u0101, Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, Sherafkan and Haidar Mu\u1e25ammad Akhta Beg\u012b (master of the horse), to set apart the horses for the royal stables, and then to select those for the officers and others according to their rank. One thousand horses purchased by the privy purse (sark\u0101r-i-kh\u0101\u1e63a) were given away in accordance with each one\u2019s requirements. The hearts, both of the merchants\u00b9 and the soldiers, were soothed and gladdened. Dawa Beg Haz\u0101ra, wishing to be distinguished for serving both in person and property, led\u00b2 the way by night to the fort of T\u012br\u012b, where his clan was. When the army arrived there, the headmen brought according to their ability horses and sheep as presents. They did good service, and as the place had pleasant pastures (alangh\u0101) his Majesty remained there for several days to recruit and to enjoy himself. Her Highness Kh\u0101nz\u0101da Begam fell ill here,\n\n\u00b9 Jauhar gives another and more probable account of this affair.\n\u00b2 L\u016bh sarkarda burd, perhaps the meaning is that he went by night in advance of the army.\nand the illness lasted, and she died. His Majesty performed the rites of mourning, and grasping the strong rope of patience, the glory of the awakened of hearts and the mark of the intelligent, he engaged in charities and works of beneficence such as befitted a princely family and might be a sweet savour to the soul of that generous matron. He then marched under the guidance of a lofty fortune towards K\u0101bul. Near Qandah\u0101r M. Hind\u0101l did homage and was received with unbounded kindness. His Majesty was much delighted at his coming, which was the preface to the advent of many others. Officers hastened from K\u0101bul in troops. But by reason of contrariety and mingling of air-currents a sickness and pestilence broke out on the march in the camp, and there were many travellers to the city of annihilation. Among them was Haidar Sult\u0101n. As the untowardness of the atmosphere was great, and the force became small M. Hind\u0101l represented that they ought to return to Qandah\u0101r for the winter and march against K\u0101bul in the beginning of spring and after making the army efficient. His Majesty said nothing to his face, but when the meeting was over he sent him this verbal message by M\u012br Saiyid Barka: \"When I did not know that you would come, or that Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M\u012brz\u0101 would leave (K\u0101mr\u0101n) I proceeded towards K\u0101bul in reliance on the Divine favours, why should I delay now because an unforeseen circumstance (the pestilence) has occurred? If this thought has come into your mind on account of the fatigues and pains of your men you can go and repose this winter in Zamin Dawar which I have given to you, and when\n\n1 Gulbadan Begam says she died after three days' illness. She calls the place Qabalp\u0101k (?) and says the body was buried there but removed three months afterwards to Kh\u0101nz\u0101da's brother's (B\u0101bar) sepulchre. In all probability Qabalp\u0101k is a copyist's error for Ghilcak (\u063a\u064a\u0644\u0643) in B\u0101b\u0101 Hasan Abd\u0101l. B\u0101yaz\u012bd, p. 69, says that there was a garden there which Hum\u0101y\u016bn visited several times.\n\n2 It would seem from Jauhar, Stewart 81 and Erskine II. 322 that it was only at T\u012br\u012b that Hind\u0101l joined Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Erskine says Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir also joined here, but from the text and also from A. N. I. 248 and B\u0101yaz\u012bd 21b it would appear that Y\u0101dg\u0101r though he left K\u0101mr\u0101n did not immediately join Hum\u0101y\u016bn. He went to Badakhsh\u012bn, and then to Qandah\u0101r (after Hum\u0101y\u016bn had marched) and did not join Hum\u0101y\u016bn till at K\u0101bul when he came along with Hum\u0101y\u016bn's harem. No doubt he went to Qandah\u0101r because his old friend (see B\u0101yaz\u012bd) Bair\u0101m was there.\nthe knot of K\u0101bul has been untied you can rejoin our service. The M\u012brz\u0101 was greatly ashamed on getting this message and begged forgiveness. His Majesty advanced with good intent and a confident hope, and braced up his heart to carrying through the business. On the march Jamil Beg, brother (younger) of B\u0101b\u016bs, whom M. K\u0101mr\u0101n had made guardian of \u0100q\u00b9 Sult\u0101n his son-in-law and had placed in Ghazn\u012bn, came and kissed the threshold, and begged the forgiveness of B\u0101b\u016bs\u2019 offences. His request was granted.\n\nWhen the army halted at the station (yurt) of Shaikh \u2018Al\u012b, which is in the neighbourhood of Paghm\u0101n (na\u2019m\u0101n in text) and Arqand\u012b, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n became disturbed at the approach of the world-conquering standards and sent forth Q\u0101sim Barl\u0101s with a body of troops. He ordered his artillery-officer, Q\u0101sim Mukhl\u012bs Tarbat\u012b to take his arsenal to Jalka Dauri near B\u0101b\u016bs Beg\u2019s house, and to draw it up there. He also brought inside the fort all the men\u2019s families who were living outside. When he had strengthened the fort he came out from K\u0101bul with pomp and insouciance and encamped near the quarters (yurt) of B\u0101b\u016bs Beg. He employed himself in reviewing and marshalling the troops. Q\u0101sim Barl\u0101s had proceeded with a body of troops to Takiya Khim\u0101r\u00b2 when Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2019azzam, H\u0101ji Muhammad and Sherafkan hastened from the royal camp and displayed their superiority. By the Divine aid\u2014which was the vanguard of conquering fortune\u2014Q\u0101sim Barl\u0101s could not withstand them and turned to flee. When only a small space remained between the two forces M. Hind\u0101l was at his own request appointed to the vanguard. The army had passed the defile of the \u201cKhw\u0101ja\u2019s ridge\u201d and had halted in the neighbourhood of Arqand\u012b when B\u0101b\u016bs and Jamil Beg and a number of their men, and with Sh\u0101h Bardi\u00b3 Kh\u0101n who held Gard\u014dz, Bangash and Naghz came\n\n\u00b9 Younger brother of Khizr Khw\u0101ja the husband of Gulbadan Begam. \u0100q Sult\u0101n, the White Prince, is his sobriquet, his name, according to B\u0101yaz\u012bd 19b, being Hasan Daulat Sult\u0101n. He was married to Hab\u012bba one of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s daughters. But he afterwards offended his father-in-law who had his wife taken away from him. See Gulbadan\u2019s Mem.\n\n\u00b2 Cam\u0101r in text. Khim\u0101r means vintner. Stewart read him\u0101r, an ass, and this is a more likely name.\n\n\u00b3 This is the man who afterwards became a saint and water-carrier and wrote poetry under the style of Bahr\u0101m Saqq\u0101. He was elder brother\nand submitted. They were received with unbounded favours. After that, Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Beg, son of Khw\u0101ja Kal\u0101n Beg, came with many men and enjoyed the fortune of service, and was exalted by princely favours. Meanwhile B\u0101b\u016bs represented that it was no time for dallying and that his Majesty should mount his horse as all the men were coming over. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b mounted the swift steed of fortune. On this occasion he sent for \u2018Ali Quli Safarci and Bah\u0101dur the sons of Haidar Sult\u0101n who were in mourning for their father and loaded them with favours and kindnesses. After a time Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n came and did homage. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n read his own downfall in the pages of the royal fortunes and sent Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101wand Ma\u1e25m\u016bd and Khw\u0101ja \u2018Abdu-l-Kh\u0101liq to apologise for his offences. He made sundry requests through the Khw\u0101jas, who arrived when the two armies were less than a mile apart. His Majesty accepted his homage and postponed decision on his petitions. He promised further favours to the Khw\u0101jas and dismissed them with honour. Out of humanity and kindness he ordered a suspension of hostilities. The object of the M\u012brz\u0101 in sending the Khw\u0101jas was to cause delay and make the king\u2019s soldiers slacken their march and to get time for himself, and he was waiting for the darkness of night so that he might by making a long night-march remove himself to a distance. When then the veil of nocturnal gloom had darkened the earth he from an obscured understanding and a benighted soul could not resolve upon experiencing the pleasure of doing homage and withdrew in all haste into the citadel. Then he took his son M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and his wives and went off to Ghazn\u012bn by B\u012bn\u012b \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r.\n\nof B\u0101yaz\u012bd the memoirs-writer. His proper name was Sh\u0101h Bard\u012b Biy\u0101t. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n had by this time taken his districts from him, and given them to Khizr Khw\u0101ja Haz\u0101ra. K\u0101mr\u0101n gave him in exchange Gh\u014drband, &c., B\u0101yaz\u012bd 19b.\n\n1 I think the meaning is that he postponed decision on K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s requests until he came forward and did homage in person. According to B\u0101yaz\u012bd Hum\u0101y\u016bn rejected all K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s proposals. Gulbadan Begam says Hum\u0101y\u016bn made presents of food and clothes to the Khw\u0101jas.\n\n2 See Jarrett II. 404n. and \u0100\u02be\u012bn text I. 592. The words in B\u0101yaz\u012bd 21a appear to be B\u012bn\u012b-K\u014dh\u012b. Lord Roberts in his \u201cForty-one years in India,\u201d II. 223 says \u201cBeni Hissar, a considerable village, surrounded by orchards and gardens, and only two miles south of the far-famed citadel of the Bala Hissar.\u201d The name means \u201cnose (or ridge) of the fortress.\u201d\nMajesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b heard of his flight he sent B\u0101b\u016bs with a number of trusty men to K\u0101bul to prevent any molestation of the inhabitants or sepoys, and to make them all hopeful of the royal favour. He appointed M. Hind\u0101l and a body of troops to pursue the Mirz\u0101 and proceeded himself to K\u0101bul with victory at his foot and fortune as his stirrup-companion. In an auspicious moment the drummers of dominion beat high the great drum (k\u016br\u0101ka) of prestige and the standard-bearers of victory advanced the stelliform standards of glory to the starry sphere. On the night of the 13th of the Jal\u0101l\u012b month of \u0100zar corresponding to the night of Wednesday, 12th Ramaz\u0101n, 952 (18th November, 1545), the conquest of K\u0101bul, the beginning of countless victories, was accomplished by heavenly aid, and the gates of joy and success opened to the hearts of mankind.\n\n1 Kaukaba. This is a play on the double meaning of the word kaukab, meaning both a star and the globe surmounting the standard, and this is all the neater from the fact that the march was at night.\n\n2 There is a good deal of confusion about the year. See Erskine II. 325n. Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn prefers 953, though some, he says, give it as 952. As pointed out by the Bib. Ind. editors the first chronogram given by A. F. yields 954, and the second, or metrical one, 952. I am of opinion that 952 is right. 12th Ramaz\u0101n, 952, appears to be a Wednesday and corresponds to 18th November, 1545. Other authorities give the date as 10th Ramaz\u0101n. A. F. gives the date of the commencement of the siege of Qandah\u0101r, 7th Mu\u1e25arram, 952, or 21st March, 1545, but does not give its termination. The omission is supplied by the B\u0101gh\u0101hn\u0101ma I. 64, which says that Qandah\u0101r was taken on Thursday, 25th Jum\u0101da-l-akhir, 952, or 4th September, 1545, and that K\u0101bul was taken on Wednesday, 12th Ramaz\u0101n, of the same year. The idea that the year was 953 seems to have arisen from supposing that Akbar was over four when K\u0101bul was taken. B\u0101yaz\u012bd and Ferishta say this, but he was just over three if the capture was in 952. We know that Hum\u0101y\u016bn was at Maghhad on the day after the Ramaz\u0101n of 951 and at J\u0101m on 21st Shaw\u0101l (see inscription in R.A. S.J. for 1897). He was then on his way to join the Persian army and so he might arrive at Qandah\u0101r in the beginning of 952 and take K\u0101bul about 9 months later. The difference between the authorities as to the day of the month of the capture of K\u0101bul may be due to some reckoning the day of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s flight as that of the capture, while others have taken the date of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s triumphal entry. Gulbudan Begam who was in K\u0101bul at the time gives the night of 12th Ramaz\u0101n as that of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s entry. Perhaps A. F. copied this.\nhours of the night had passed when his Majesty exalted the plain of K\u0101bul by the radiance of his advent. Navid\u012b found the chronogram of this victory to be K\u0101bulr\u0101 girift, He took K\u0101bul. Another is the hemistich \"b\u0113 jang girift mulk-i-K\u0101bul az we,\" \"without a battle he took the country of K\u0101bul from him.\"\n\nWhen the gates of joy and gladness opened at the glorious indications of the personality of his Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, and the foundations of dominion were thereby renewed, his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b regarded not the defeat of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, nor the conquest of K\u0101bul, but abode in expectation of the blissful footsteps of his Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h until they brought to him, in an auspicious moment, that world-intelligence who at that time was, so far as regarded the existence of his bodily elements aged three years two months and eight days. His Majesty obtained spiritual and temporal felicity by beholding that blissful nursling of light divine, and prostrated himself in thanksgiving for the safety of the young shoot of fortune's garden, and for the glorious acquisition of the lamp of the family. In the presence of this glorious fortune, and before this abundant bliss he opened the gates of liberality and beneficence for all mankind. On the morning after that world-illuminating day his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b sat on the throne of fortune and attainment, and received the homage (k\u00f6rni\u015fk) of the pillars of the state and of the soldiery and servants, while at the same time the nations were made fortunate by kissing the threshold, and raising the hands of supplication implored from God the enduring glory of the Khil\u0101fat, and the uprearing of the standards of empire. His Majesty threw open the gates of justice and beneficence before all people and tranquilly spent the winter aloft in the citadel in serving the Creator and in\n\n1 Apparently this is the nom-de-plume of Khw\u0101ja Zain-al-\u0100bid\u012bn, a Persian poet. Rieu Supplement No. 307. He afterwards called himself 'Abd\u012b and died in Ardabil 988. Perhaps he is the B\u0101b\u0101 'Abd\u012b mentioned in the Haft Iql\u012bm as having settled at Qandah\u0101r. See Eth\u00e9's Cat. 470, art. No. 1222.\n\n2 The text has 2 years but this is clearly wrong. Akbar was born on 5th Rajab, 949, or 15th October, 1542, and K\u0101bul was entered on 12th Ramaz\u0101n, 952, so that according to the Muhammadan calendar Akbar was then 3 years 2 months 8 days old, or 3 years 1 month according to the solar calendar. B\u012by\u0101z\u012bd says he was then between 4 and 5 which would make the year of the capture 953.\ncomforting His creatures. Of the events which happened about this time there were the deaths of Y\u00fcnus \u2018Ali and M\u016byid Beg who were leading officers of the Court. At the same time it came to the ears of his Majesty that Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2019azzam was plotting to run away in company with Muqaddam Beg, and to convey themselves to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n. This vexed greatly his noble heart. He exiled Muqaddam Beg to Kashmir and discarded Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2019azzam. By the felicity of his Majesty\u2019s presence and his bounteous shade the country of K\u0101bul became an abode of security and peace and a resting-place of Divine mercy.\n\n1 B\u0101yazid 21b says that the death of this man caused universal joy.\n2 He did good service by facilitating Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s escape after the battle of Qanauj, and probably for this reason he was only punished by banishment. He was a K\u014dka or foster-brother and had been one of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s officers. He seems to have afterwards come back to Hum\u0101y\u016bn. Text I. 296 and 300.\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nCelebration of the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h's Circumcision, Illuminations; and Manifestation of Marvels by the Tender Plant of Glory's Garden.\n\n'Tis ever the way of noble grantors of desires and auspicious-minded lords to seize opportunities for liberality, and to fulfil a choice worship, whose acm\u00e9 is the conquest of affections, under the guise of Use and Wont\u2014a course whereby they are protected from the dulled vision of blear-eyed mortals. Accordingly now that fortune's breeze was blowing afresh, and the rose-garden of attainment had bloomed anew, the custom of circumcision, as applied to the new growth of fortune's garden, and fresh offshoot of the palm of glory and grandeur, was made an occasion for the contentment and enrichment of mankind. In the prime of spring, when the spirit of plants was in motion and the nightingale of delight was on the wing\u2014\n\nVerse.\n\n\"Violets raised their head from the stream's lip\nEarth was ambergris-perfumed from the fragrance of flowers,\nThe fragrant breeze of morn, let us say\nCarried a thousand musk-bags in her bosom.\"\n\nHe ordered that an encampment should be made in the Urta B\u0101gh, a most delightful spot, and that affection might all the more be won\u2014and this in truth is the giving of thanks to the Almighty, he threw open the gates of joy and pleasance, and in renewal of the splendours of Kaik\u0101\u00fcs and of Kaiqub\u0101d it was directed that their\n\n1 Gulbadan Begam describes Humayun's bounties on this occasion to the widows and orphans of those who had fallen at Causs, &c.\n2 The word is T\u00fcrki and more commonly written \u0627\u0648\u0631\u062a. It means middle so that Urta B\u0101gh might mean the middle or inner garden.\nHighnesses the Begams should grace the entrancing garden with their presence, according\\(^1\\) to their ranks and conditions, while the Amirs and the city-magnates should occupy the C\u0101r B\u0101gh. All the Amirs bound the girdle of endeavour on the waist of joy and undertook these arrangements. The city magistrates, and leading men exerted themselves in an admirable fashion, while the artists and craftsmen vied with one another in decorating the shops, and in promoting the briskness of the bazar. Soon there was such ornamentation as exceeds description. Every day his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b came and adorned the banquet, and he distinguished everyone by sympathetic expressions suitable to their rank and condition. Before the festival (of the circumcision) took place Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Beg, and other familiars of the Court, who had been sent to convey her Majesty Mariam-Mak\u0101n\u012b, arrived from Qandah\u0101r, and her blissful advent increased the rejoicings.\n\nIt occurred to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b that he should make manifest to great and small the touchstone-capability ('iyy\u0101r-i-d\u0101n\u016bd\u0101) of the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, from whose brow there streamed while yet of tender years, thousands of rays of light divine. He therefore arranged a princely festival in the pavilions of chastity. All the great ladies attended in the gynaecceum.\\(^2\\) For the instruction of the spectators his Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h was brought in on the shoulder of respect and placed on the auspicious Divan, and in conformity with orders her Majesty Mariam-Mak\u0101n\u012b entered in the train of the other ladies, and without being distinguished in any way. The design of the king was that the prince (lit. the light of the eye-pupil of the Sult\u0101nate) should single out his honoured mother from the crowd of ladies. By light divine his Majesty, without difficulty, hesitation, or mistake, and in virtue of his abiding intelligence and innate discernment took refuge with his saintly mother, and put himself into her arms. On beholding this glorious act\u2014surprising to the minds of the superficial and to persons who\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The meaning seems to be that the ladies' tents were arranged in order according to their ranks.\n\n\\(^2\\) B\u0101rg\u0101h-i-har\u012bm, which, perhaps, only means private audience-hall. It is not clear to me from A.F.'s language whether the ladies were veiled or not, but presumably this would make little difference to Akbar who had not seen his mother since he was an infant.\nare swayed by what is usual\u2014a shout arose among the spectators, and they recognised the power of the eternally-nourished one, and prodigy of fate's worship. All perceived that this was not the work of the bodily senses which put a difference between childhood and adolescence. Rather it was sought but spiritual intuition and Divine teaching. 'Twas holy light breaking forth from its ambushes by the instrumentality of this nursling of Fortune's garden.\n\nOf a truth, the veil of distance can be no hindrance to what is eternally conjoined, nor apparent remoteness any impediment to spiritual propinquity. And when we consider the matter what room is there for remoteness? For, in this firstling of Life's rosebush there is perfect contact with the Prim\u00e6val, and the diffusive lights of being, the perfecting (takmil) of the bodily frame, and the burnishing (tasqil) of the senses assume form pari passu (darja ba darja). And there is close relation with the glorious world of the Holy and the Absolute to whose verge there is no entrance for the darkness of ignorance, or the plethora of heedlessness. Nor is it hidden from those who can look far into the world of mystery that though this sublime Master seemeth to have been engendered amid bodily elements and from protoplasm (mawadd-i-hayyilani) yet as regards the source of his nature and the root of his being his forefathers and foremothers have been procreated from him so that spiritually and in an esoteric sense he is the Father of Fathers. And to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2014that curtain-raiser of celestial mysteries\u2014it was manifest that the Cosmoplast of the outer world had brought this nursling of Creation's Spring into the field of actuality in order, firstly, that he might experience the stages of mortal life, and secondly, that he might bring together and compose the distractions of the world. In short he (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) under the guise of the rite of circumcision offered thanksgiving to the Bestower of spiritual and temporal blessings. Each day there was a novel, royal feast, and thanks were returned to the world-adorning Creator. The great ones of realm and religion came from all parts, and were made happy by royal gifts. Among these, Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101 had the honour of performing obeisance. The brief account of him is that on the first uprearing of fortune's\n\n1 If this means that Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir deserted K\u0101mr\u0101n on Hum\u0101y\u016bn's first appearance before Qandah\u0101r, it is wrong, for we know from B\u0101yz\u0101d,\nstandards on the borders of Qandah\u0101r he separated from M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, as has already been described, and proceeded to Badakhsh\u0101n. As he could not succeed there, he set off in order to enter his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s service. At the time that the sublime army proceeded from Qandah\u0101r to conquer K\u0101bul, the M\u012brz\u0101 after experiencing the world\u2019s hardships arrived at Qandah\u0101r. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n showed him every hospitality there, and then in accordance with orders he had the felicity of paying his respects to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b at that joyous time (the circumcision festival). He had the good fortune also to do homage to the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h and to be made fortunate by the glances of favour.\n\nDuring this joyful season, which was the time of the adorning of pleasure\u2019s springtide, and the period of decking the garden of dominion and prestige, at a moment when the constellations were shedding light from favourable aspects upon mortals the meeting for the decorating of the young plant of the Divine rose garden, to wit, for the circumcision of his Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, was held with thousands of rejoicings. The materials (asb\u0101b) for the joy of mankind were brought together, the gates (abw\u0101b) of joy were opened for mortals. Small and great shared in the princely gifts, and high and low experienced the royal favour. The world\u2019s pains (kulfath\u0101) ended in pleasure (ulfat) and the world\u2019s differences changed into unison. The captains presented their gifts, and were exalted by grand favours. In the midst of these celebrations his Majesty for the cheering of hearts, which is a great buttress of sovereignty, proceeded towards Khw\u0101ja Reg Raw\u0101n,\u00b9 and ordered festivities. A world obeyed order was issued that the amirs should wrestle\u00b2 with one another. His Majesty himself by means of the balance of inspection picked out equally-matched antagonists. His Majesty wrestled with Im\u0101m\u00b3 Quli Q\u016brci and M. Hind\u0101l did so with\n\n\u00b9 Moving sand. See B\u0101bar 146 and Jarrett II. 409 and especially Wood\u2019s Journey to the source of the Oxus, p. 115. The moving sand is in the upper end of the K\u014dh D\u0101man, and on its eastern side.\n\n\u00b2 The account of the wrestling is taken from B\u0101yaz\u012bd 216.\n\n\u00b3 Perhaps the Im\u0101m Quli Shigh\u0101l\u012b of Blochmann, 512. The word Shigh\u0101l\u012b is probably derived from Shigh\u0101wal. Shaw\u2019s T\u0101rk\u012b Dict. 134.\nY\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir M. After that he went to Khw\u0101ja Se' Y\u0101r to visit the arghaw\u0101n groves. Then he returned and bade preparations be made for a great feast. He distributed fiefs, presents, and robes of honour to the servants of the threshold in accordance with their deserts. M. Hind\u0101l obtained Gh\u0101z\u016bn and its dependencies while Zam\u012bn D\u0101war and T\u012br\u012b were given to Ulugh Mirz\u0101. All those connected with the Court received gifts in proportion to their conditions, and the tribes of mankind abode with tranquillity and ease of heart in the shade of abundance, and the light of favour.\n\nAmong the events which occurred during the festivities was the arrival of the ambassadors of Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp. They brought congratulations on the victory and delivered suitable gifts. At their head was Walad Beg whom his Majesty welcomed with princely favours. Another was the arrival of Sh\u0101h Q\u0101sim Tagh\u0101l who brought a petition and gifts from M. Sulaim\u0101n. But the Mirz\u0101's excuses for not coming in person had not the honour of being accepted by his Majesty, and a peremptory order was issued for his attendance and he was informed that his reputation for sincerity and loyalty depended upon his appearing in person to do homage. Another thing which happened about this time was the arrival of Mir Saiyid 'Al\u012b who was eminent in Afghanistan and Bal\u016bcist\u0101n for his possessions and for his honesty. He resided near D\u016bk\u012b which is an appurtenance of Sind. He greeted the threshold with the foot of integrity and the head of sincerity, and became a recipient of royal favours. D\u016bk\u012b was awarded to him. About the same time Lavang Bal\u016bc, who was a leader among his people, came along with his brethren and did homage. His Majesty received him likewise with favour and granted him Sh\u0101l and Mastang. These visitors were granted their desires and dismissed rapidly lest the wild nature\n\n---\n\n1 The fountain of the Three friends, B\u0101bar 147 and Jarrett II. 409n.\n2 Sulaim\u0101n's maternal uncle, B\u0101ya-zid 22a.\n3 Jauhar, Stewart, 83.\n4 The text has Hind but I adopt the variant of Sind as D\u016bk\u012b is used by B\u0101bar, 152 and 3, for the south-eastern hills of Afghanistan which is near Sind. In the \u0100in, Jarrett II. 397, D\u016bk\u012b is given as the eastern division of Qandah\u0101r. Erskine, Hist. II. 327, accepts the Hind of the text and remarks in a note that D\u016bk\u012b was probably dependent on Multan.\nof such dwellers in clachans (r\u016bst\u0101 parvard\u0101n) should prove too strong for them, and delay be inimical to their constitutions.\n\nAmong the things which happened about this time there was this, that Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br M\u012brz\u0101 from an ill-fatedness and an inward wickedness made a confused jumble of all favours, past and subsequent, and placed them in the alcove of oblivion and contumaciously took his stand on the path of wickedness and perversity. He gave ear to wretches of whom Mu\u1e93affar the foster-brother of M. \u2018\u0100skar\u012b was the ringleader, and continually harboured evil thoughts. When these facts came, one after the other, to the knowledge of his Majesty, and were confirmed by honest intelligencers, especially when \u2018Abdul Jabbar Shaikh, who was a most trustworthy person, and was intimate with one of the plotters and shared his counsels, came and detailed the circumstances after inquiry, the holy heart of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Janna-t-\u0101shiy\u0101n\u012b became disgusted and he had Mu\u1e93affar K\u014dk\u0101 seized and put to death. Then he sent for Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63\u012br M. and reproached him by the mouth of Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n. The substance of the rebuke was as follows: \u201cWe thought that when we had passed over your grievous offences, and had bestowed boundless favours on you, you would take warning and atone for your transgressions, past and present, and that even the ungrateful might have a limit and some discretion.\u201d The M\u012brz\u0101 cast aside shame, and sometimes was silent and sometimes denied or feigned ignorance. His Majesty, after making categorical statements (of his offences) and after royal reproofs, directed Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Ish\u0101k \u0100q\u0101 and others to confine him in the K\u0101bul citadel (the B\u0101l\u0101 \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r) near the room where M. \u2018\u0100skar\u012b was imprisoned.\n\nOne of the things that happened at this time was the death of Caghat\u0101\u012b Sult\u0101n, who was a young Mogul prince and the unique of the age for beauty and character. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b regarded him with affection and distinguished him by favours. He felt his loss deeply, but reflecting on the Divine decree which hath assigned existence absolute to the other world, and to this world\n\n---\n\n1 This expression (his\u0101b\u012b) seems to refer to the statement in B\u0101yaz\u012bd 22a, that nearly 30 charges were formulated against Y\u0101dg\u0101r, one being an act of disrespect committed by him so long ago as at the taking of C\u0101mp\u0101n\u012br.\nonly contingent existence, he wisely took refuge in submission and self-surrender.

According to Rieu, T\u00fcrki Cat. 301, there were five poets of this name. The one in question is probably the second on Rieu\u2019s list, Mir Am\u0101n\u012b of Her\u0101t who according to the Bodleian Cat. of Persian MSS. p. 219, used to live at K\u0101bul and was killed at Jaunp\u0101r by a fall from his horse in 981 A.H. A.F. has apparently taken the lines from B\u0101yazid 22o, but the third line there is\n\nBad\u0101oni has a similar chronogram about Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n\u2019s death.

Sulaim\u0101n became confirmed, and it was made certain that he had twisted away his head from the burden of commands, and that the idea of sovereignty was paining it, and that he was inwardly troubled by this vain imagination, his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni, in the beginning of 953 (March 1546), turned the rein of intention towards Badakh\u0161h\u0101n. One of the Mirz\u0101's rebellious acts was that after the taking of K\u0101bul he laid hold of Kh\u016bst and Andar\u0101b, which were in the possession of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n,\u00b9 and had been assigned to one of the royal servants. As moreover, by theory and practice the whole of Badakh\u0161h\u0101n did not belong to M. Sulaim\u0101n, his Majesty desired also to take away Qand\u016bz and its dependencies and to make them over in fief to one of his followers, and bade him be contented with what his Majesty G\u012bt\u012b-sit\u0101ni Firdaus-mak\u0101ni had given to his father. When his Majesty's dominions should be enlarged, his fief too would be increased. In consideration, however, of the Mirz\u0101's circumstances Qand\u016bz was left as it was. The Mirz\u0101 ignorantly averted his face from his benefactor, and openly smote the door of opposition, and had the kh\u016b\u1e6dba read in his own name. His Majesty resolved to extinguish the flames of disaffection. He left his Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h under God's protection and set out in a propitious hour, and halted at Yurat C\u0101l\u0101k.\u00b2 He took M. 'Askari along with him. He had anxieties about Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir Mirz\u0101, and when the army reached the Ulang of Qar\u0101 B\u0101gh\u00b3 he determined\n\n\u00b9 K\u0101mr\u0101n is not mentioned, but I think he must be meant. All the MSS. however have only the word Mirz\u0101 so that perhaps A.F. really meant Sulaim\u0101n.\n\u00b2 B\u0101yaz\u012bd seems to make Khw\u0101ja Riw\u0101z the first stage.\n\u00b3 There is a Qar\u0101 B\u0101gh west of Ghazn\u012b called by A.F. in the \u0100\u02be\u012bn the Qandah\u0101r Qar\u0101 B\u0101gh, but the\nthat he would relieve him of the pangs of existence and thereby give peace and security to the State. For the match of his strife, and the spark of his contentiousness were like to consume all the families. An order to this effect was sent to Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Ali Tagh\u0101\u012b who had charge of K\u0101bul. He out of complete simplicity and want of perspicuity returned for answer, \u201cI have never killed a sparrow, how can I achieve the killing of the Mirz\u0101.\u201d His Majesty passed over his simplicity and charged Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim Mauj\u012b with this most proper service and he in the night-time sped the arrow of death by a bowstring. When the holy heart was at rest from the malevolence of the Mirz\u0101, his Majesty marched under the Divine guidance towards the Badakhsh\u0101ns (Badakhsh\u0101n\u0101t). When he arrived at Andar\u0101b and had encamped at the garden of \u2018Ali Quli Andar\u0101b\u012b, M. Sulaim\u0101n owing to his evil fortune advanced to offer battle and drew up at the village of T\u012brgir\u0101n which is a dependency of Andar\u0101b. When his Majesty heard this, he sent forward M. Hind\u0101l, Qara\u010da Kh\u0101n, H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and a number of other brave men. A great battle ensued between the royal army and the Mirz\u0101. The latter protected himself by a trench and stood firm, while Mirz\u0101 Beg Barl\u0101s and a body of archers discharged their arrows from behind it. M. Hind\u0101l, Qara\u010da Kh\u0101n and H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n displayed their valour and Khw\u0101ja Mu\u2018azzam and Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n were wounded by arrows, and had to dismount. Walad Q\u0101sim Beg, Ja\u2018far Beg and the bodyguards, and A\u1e25mad Beg, and D\u016bgh\u0101n Beg who belonged to the Sh\u0101h\u2019s special bodyguard and who in company with the ambassador served his Majesty in this fight, came to the ground in consequence of their horses falling. The result hung in\n\nQara B\u0101gh of the text must be the place about 25 miles north of K\u0101bul and near Ist\u0101l\u0101f.\n\n1 In plain language the unfortunate Mirz\u0101 was strangled. A.F.\u2019s account seems taken from B\u0101yaz\u012bd who gives specimens of the charges brought against the Mirz\u0101. He says Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n suggested the employment of Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim. B\u0101yaz\u012bd represents the execution as taking place before Hum\u0101y\u016bn left K\u0101bul and this seems probable. The Mirz\u0101\u2019s body was buried in a high ground opposite the citadel-gate and near a pond, but was afterwards removed to Ghazn\u012bn, to his father\u2019s sepulchre.\n\n2 B\u0101yaz\u012bd 255.\n\n3 B\u0101yaz\u012bd has Dal\u016b Q\u0101sim, brother of Walad Beg.\n\n4 T\u016bgh\u0101n in B\u0101yaz\u012bd.\nthe balance till a body of devoted servants such as Shaikh Buhl\u00fbl, Sultan Muhammad Fawr\u00e2q, La\u1e6d\u012bf\u00ee of Sabhrind, Sultan Husain Kh\u00e2n, Muhammad Kh\u00e2n Jal\u0101r, Muhammad Kh\u00e2n Turkam\u00e2n, M. Qu\u00e2 Jal\u0101r, M. Quli, brother of Haidar Muhammad Kh\u00e2n, and Shah Qu\u00e2 N\u00e2ranj\u00ee relying on the invisible Opener attacked M. Beg. And having by God\u2019s help crossed the trench, they raised their swords and briskly attacked the foe. The latter could not maintain themselves or abide the onset and fled, reckoning dispersion and route as a gain. On every side the braves of the field of action and lions of battle\u2019s jungle advanced on the plains of victory. Ere his Majesty had mounted his swift steed the reverberation of victory sounded in his ears. The voice of exaltation burst forth. M. Sulaim\u00e2n did not remain firm but went off towards the defiles of Kh\u00f6st by way of N\u00e2r\u00een and Ishkamish. T\u00fblak of T\u00e2liqan, M. Beg Barl\u0101s, and Avis Sult\u00e2n who was a scion of the kings of Moghulistan separated themselves from M. Sulaim\u00e2n and did homage. M. Hind\u00e2l and a body of heroes were ordered to seize the fugitives and his Majesty himself took part in the pursuit. Many Badakhsh\u00e2ni horses fell into the hands of the brave warriors, and his Majesty arrived by the Pass of Sh\u00e2gh\u00e2n at the valley of Kh\u00f6st. M. Sulaim\u00e2n fled miserably with a few followers to K\u00fbl\u00e2b. The Badakhsh\u00e2n nobles and soldiers came in crowds and did homage and everyone of them was treated with consideration and with favours suitable to their position. On account of the abundance of fruits his Majesty remained several days in Kh\u00f6st and was the accomplisher of the wishes of the people. For the purpose of hunting waterfowl and partridges and for fishing he proceeded to Warask.\n\n1 Blochmann 411.\n2 Blochmann 385.\n3 Blochmann 480.\n4 N\u00e2r\u00ee in text.\n5 B\u00e2yaz\u00eed calls him the ruler of Gh\u00fbr\u00ee (q.n. Gh\u00fbr).\n6 S\u00e2s\u00e2n in text, but the variant is right. It was north of Tirgir\u00e2n and Andar\u00e2b.\n7 Beyond the Oxus.\n8 It would seem that M\u00e2ham, the mother of Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn, came from Kh\u00f6st, for B\u00e2yaz\u00eed, 26a says that Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn stayed in Kh\u00f6st for several days in the society of his maternal grandparents. The Khw\u00e2ja Muhammad \u2018Al\u00ee mentioned in B\u00e2bar\u2019s Mem. as the ruler of Kh\u00f6st, is probably either M\u00e2ham\u2019s father, or her brother. If the latter he must be the Mir Muhammad \u2018Al\u00ee whom Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn put in charge of K\u00e2bul.\n9 So in B\u00e2yaz\u00eed. Text has Darask. The place has already been\nThere he practised the netting\\(^1\\) of birds (ganjishk) which is a speciality of that place. From thence he went to Kal\u0101g\u0101n\\(^2\\) and from there to K\u012bshm.\\(^3\\) M. Sulaim\u0101n did not think it advisable to remain in that neighbourhood and so had crossed the \u0100m\u016b and was there in perturbation with a few followers. One thing that happened at K\u012bshm was that a servant of Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp named Khusr\u016b\\(^4\\) had fled and entered his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s service. He had used some improper language about the Sh\u0101h, and D\u016bgh\u0101n Beg, Husain Beg and Ja\u02bffar Beg of the Sh\u0101h\u2019s bodyguard and who were in attendance on his Majesty, on hearing of this met Khusr\u016b in the K\u012bshm bazaar and killed him. His Majesty disapproved of this lawlessness and imprisoned them, but after some days he, at the intercession of Husain Quli Sult\u0101n Muhrd\u0101r, drew the line of forgiveness over their offence.\n\nWhen the affairs of Badakhsh\u0101n had been settled, Qand\u016bz and its dependencies were given to M. Hind\u0101l, and much of Badakhsh\u0101n was divided in fiefs among the officers. Mun\u02bfim Kh\u0101n was made ta\u1e25sild\u0101r of Kh\u00f6st, and B\u0101b\u016bs was sent to collect the revenues of T\u0101liq\u0101n.\\(^5\\) His Majesty resolved that for the better management of the affairs of Badakhsh\u0101n and for the comfort of the subjects and soldiery he would make Qil\u02bfa Zafar his winter-quarters. He therefore proceeded in that direction; but when he came to Sh\u0101khd\u0101n, between K\u012bshm and Qil\u02bfa Zafar, he fell ill and so had to halt there for nearly two months. At the beginning of this illness he lay unconscious for four days, and on this account unpleasing rumours became rife, and men left their fiefs and came in. M. Hind\u0101l left his post with improper ideas and in concert with other officers came as far as the bank of the K\u014dkce, and the partizans of M. Sulaim\u0101n raised their heads here and there. But Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n came with a number of loyalists and pitched his tent in the royal courtyard and\n\n\\(^1\\) See B\u0101yaz\u012bd, 26a & b, and B\u0101bar, Mem. 153.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Kalag\u0101n of the maps.

'Askari who was likely to be seditions, bringing him into his own tent. Qar\u0101ca acted as a personal attendant, and waited on his Majesty during his sickness. No one entered the Presence except Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101wand Mahm\u016bd\\(^1\\) and Khw\u0101ja Mu'\u012bn.\\(^1\\) On the fifth day, which was the beginning of the convalescence, his Majesty showed signs of improvement, and M\u012br Barka entered and paid his respects. When his Majesty's glance fell upon him, the M\u012br became agitated and showed a desire\\(^2\\) to sacrifice himself as a thanksgiving for his Majesty's recovery. His Majesty said \"M\u012br,\\(^8\\) God hath spared (bakhsh\u0101d) me.\" The M\u012br gave some hints of the confusion of affairs and of the rectitude of Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n. His Majesty had him called, and spoke benignantly to him, and expressed his sense of his services. At the same moment he sent a rescript of favour to the ornament of dominion, the tender plant of the stream of sovereignty, the head and trunk of fortune's springtide, to wit, his Majesty the Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h, by the hands of Fa\u1e63\u012bl Beg, lest any evil tidings should have reached there and have dimmed the radiant heart of that nursling of Divine light, or should have caused commotions in that country. By a happy coincidence Fa\u1e63\u012bl Beg arrived with the firman of favour on the morning after the night on which the distressing news of his Majesty's illness had reached K\u0101bul. The coming of the glad tidings dispelled grief and was productive of universal order and steadfastness. The flames of discord died down, and M. Hind\u0101l hastened back to his place, and everyone else went back to his j\u0101ig\u012br.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) They were father and son. There is an account of Mu'\u012bn, the son, in Blochmann. He is perhaps the same as the Mu'\u012bn who was Q\u0101j\u012b of Lahor, Blochmann, 545. Mu'\u012bn's son was Sharafu-d-d\u012bn who married Bakhsh\u012b B\u0101n\u016b, Akbar's sister, and became afterwards a rebel. The family was descended from Khw\u0101ja \u0100hr\u0101r the famous saint of Samarkand.\n\n\\(^2\\) Perhaps the meaning is: Changed his intention of devoting himself into thanksgiving for Hum\u0101y\u016bn's recovery.\n\n\\(^8\\) M\u012br Barka was the son of M\u012br 'Abdull\u0101h and is several times referred to in the Akbarn\u0101ma. According to Jauhar it was C\u016bcak Begam who waited on Hum\u0101y\u016bn during his illness and was rewarded by seeing him open his eyes when she squeezed some pomegranate juice into his lips. B\u0101yaz\u012bd praises the attention of F\u0101\u1e6dima Begam the Urd\u016b Beg\u012b whose daughter married Khw\u0101ja Mu'aggam and was killed by him. Perhaps it was the same F\u0101\u1e6dima who married B\u0101q\u012b Kh\u0101n. Badoni, II. 61.\nAmong the occurrences of this year was the killing of Khw\u0101ja Sultan Muhammad Rashidi who held the office of Vizier. The short history of this event is as follows: Khw\u0101ja Mu'aggam in conjunction with sundry vagabonds, whose brains were ruined, adopted some bigoted phrases of the religious views of some heretical, worthless fools who had no power of reflection in their natures, and were entangled in wordy wranglings, whose nostrils took in naught of the fragrance of truth and justice and in the tree of whose understanding there was no fruit produced by the flowers of knowledge, and having conceived faithless bigotry to be faith he came into the quarters of the Khw\u0101ja on the night of 21st Rama\u1e0d\u0101n, 16th November, 1546, just as the day's fasting was over, and broke his fast by giving him of the water of the sword of ignorance for his final draught. Then fearing the wrath of the king, which is typical of Divine chastisement, he took to flight. When this news came to the ears of his Majesty he sent men to seize him and his companions, and a strict order was despatched to the authorities in K\u0101bul, which was the residence of those ill-starred ones. Mu\u1e25ammad 'Al\u012b Tagh\u0101l, Faq\u012bl Beg and others, who were in the service of his Majesty the Shahinsh\u0101h, and were managing the affairs of K\u0101bul, on receiving the command seized Khw\u0101ja Mu'aggam and his companions and imprisoned them.\n\nWhen there appeared at Sh\u0101khd\u0101n signs of convalescence in the burning frame (mis\u0101j-i-wahh\u0101j) of his Majesty Jah\u0101ng\u012br he seated himself in the guarded litter of the Divine favour and proceeded towards Qil'a Zafar. M\u0101lik\u0101n B\u0101y\u0101zid who was an eminent physician and had been nominated as tutor to his Majesty\n\n---\n\n1 B\u0101y\u0101zid calls him in his list \"Diwan,\" and there spells his name as Rashid.\n2 B\u0101y\u0101zid 27b, describes the murder, but says nothing of bigotry's having been the motive. It was committed by sundry Persians in concert with Mu'aggam and apparently capidity had to do with it for when they fled they carried off some of Shah Tahmisp's presents from Takht-i-Sulaim\u0101n (i.e. the place mentioned by Wood 180). N\u012bs\u0101nudd\u012bn mentions that the Khw\u0101ja came with Hum\u0101y\u016bn from Persia. Probably therefore he was a Sh\u012b'a and this may have made him obnoxious to Khw\u0101ja Mu'aggam.\n3 \u0100b meaning both water and glitter and applied to the wave-markings on a sword.\nthe Shahinshah, and whose grandfather had been in the service of that Alexander\u00b9 and Aristotle (Sikandar-Makani Arist\u014d-Nish\u0101ni) Mirz\u0101 Ulugh Beg, and had been distinguished among all the mathematical observers, performed excellent service during this illness. When his Majesty reached Qil\u2019a Zafar he soon recovered his health, and his equilibrium was restored. By the completion of the recovery of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni joy and delight came into the hands of the desires of mortals. In accordance with orders a grass\u00b2 house was built and he often distributed justice and happiness therefrom. From it Sherafkan, the son of K\u016bc Beg, received investiture of Kahmard, Zuh\u0101k and B\u0101mi\u0101n. And from excess of kindness his Majesty announced that when the army arrived at K\u0101bul he would add Ghorb\u0101nd to his fiefs. His Majesty took the pleasure of tasq\u0101wal\u00b3\u2014hunting which in the Badakhsh\u0101n language is called shik\u0101r-i-nihilam.\n\n\u00b9 The epithet Sikandar-Mak\u0101n\u012b may serve to illustrate that of Mariam-Mak\u0101n\u012b applied to Akbar\u2019s mother. Ulugh Beg\u2019s real name was Muhammad Turgh\u0101n according to Vambery. The two astronomers who helped him in the composition of his tables were Ghiy\u0101sudd\u012bn Jamsh\u012bd and the Q\u0101z\u012bz\u0101da (Sal\u0101hud-d\u012bn). One of them was perhaps B\u0101yaz\u012bd\u2019s grandfather (see D\u2019Herbelot\u2019s articles, Ulugh Beg and Zig, and Jarrett II. 12, No. 85). The person meant may however be \u2018Al\u012b Koshj\u012b, said by D\u2019Herbelot to be the Q\u0101z\u012bz\u0101da\u2019s son. See Erskine\u2019s B\u0101bar 51n. 4.\n\n\u00b2 Kh\u0101na-i-k\u0101n, the kh\u0101na-i-k\u0101n\u012b of B\u0101yaz\u012bd. B\u0101yaz\u012bd, from whom A.F. borrows, tells us that the house was built by Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Ma\u1e25m\u016bd who was then M\u012br Buy\u016bt\u0101t or Barrack-master. The time was winter. B\u0101yaz\u012bd tells a story in connection with this house, of Hum\u0101y\u016bn and some intimate courtiers (ahl-i-mi\u015b\u0101st) having cooked bughr\u0101 (macaroni?) there. He also tells of Sherafkan\u2019s visit. When he first came he was drunk and Hum\u0101y\u016bn seeing his state from behind the screen (\u1e63\u016bgh), ordered him off. When he came again some days afterwards, Hum\u0101y\u016bn behaved with great delicacy towards him and granted him certain districts. K\u0101n means a mine and also a sheath, and so may mean a screen, but I incline to think that the \u012bk k\u0101n\u012b of B\u0101yaz\u012bd is a copyists\u2019 error for \u012bk k\u0101h\u012b, made of thatch or straw.\n\n\u00b3 Neither tasq\u0101wal nor nihilam occurs in the dictionaries. A.F. here copies B\u0101yaz\u012bd who describes, p. 23b, an expedition to the mountains on the other side of the K\u014dkca. They arrived at the hills, which were excessively steep, at midnight, and hunted the deer next morning. They passed so near and so quickly that they could not be shot with arrows and had to be caught by the hand. The word nihilam is used by B\u0101bar,\nThe dread residence of his Majesty in Badakhsh\u0101n wrought dismay in all T\u016br\u0101n. The Usbeks gathered together and were full of apprehension, and could find no suitable remedy for their fears.\n\nMem. 28, and Erskine (or Leydon) says that he does not know what animal it is. In reality wihikam is not the name of an animal, but of a method of hunting, viz., driving. Its synonym tasq\u0101wal is T\u016brk\u012b and the last part is perhaps J\u0101l awal, meaning an enclosure. (Bedhouse).\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nUNVEILING THE MYSTERIES OF DESIGN IN THE STRIFE-STIRRINGS OF M. KAMBAN, AND ACCOUNT OF HIS RULE OVER KABUL.\n\n'Tis an ancient canon and an established ordinance that when God the Creator of the world wills to set an elect one on the throne of sway over mortals and by establishing him on a kingdom-adorning seat to place in his mighty hand the bridle of men's hearts, He maketh him in the beginning of his course the alighting-place of divers difficulties and the receptacle of sundry afflictions to the end that he may the more fully appreciate the force of the unending favours which stand ready for him in the hidden world; so that by becoming conversant with the varied stages of existence he may come to know personally Grace and Wrath, expansion and contraction, joy and sorrow. All this is clear to those who are familiar with ancient records, and are cognisant of old stories. But inasmuch as the personality of the holy product of the meeting\\(^1\\) of the two seas of the Divine Power (Jal\u0101l) and the Divine Beauty (Jam\u0101l), his Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, to wit, is by virtue of the Eternal Decree designated for all the stages of knowledge, and as the world-adorning Deity created him a wise-hearted\\(^2\\) Teacher and an illuminated, farseeing soul needing not the instruction of any of the sons of men, the apparition of those calamities was not to acquaint him with Grace and Wrath, nor to burn away carnalities and mortalities. Rather did the order of the manifestations of the glories of opposing qualities and the notes of conflicting attributes unveil themselves as of course and in their full perfection. And there was an illustration\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mu'jma'-i-bahrain. Explained as meaning the meeting of salt and fresh water. It was the title given by the ill-fated D\u0101r\u0101 Shikoh to his book which was intended to reconcile the Hindu and Muhammadan religions.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cf. FaizI's verses, Bad\u0101oni, II. 261 and Lowe, 277.\n\n\\(^3\\) Referring to Akbar's refusal, when a child, to learn his lessons. See infra, p. 519.\nof this in his early years, for at that time his holy soul kept aloof from inappropriate teaching. These truthful remarks will make it clear to the wise and the admonished that it is in the eyes of the superficial that such facts\\(^1\\) are regarded as arising from abundance of instruction and a surplus of knowledge, while in the eyes of those who see the truth they are but the inevitable refulgence of a personality imbued with wisdom from of old. And whenever the bitter\\(^2\\) waters of affliction are to be poured into the lips of one who stands afar off from the courts of Unity, and is a bewildered wanderer in the desert of astoniedness, there is in the first place a curve (lit. a fold or wrinkle) of magnificence cast into his forehead\\(^3\\) of acceptance and he is made the originator of divers act of ingratitude, and the shower-forth of varieties of injustice and tyranny, till he be flung into eternal wrath and everlasting punishment. This is a figure of the condition of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n who fell out with his benefactor and elder brother, his eternal superior, chosen one of God, king of the age, and just ruler, and wrought the destruction in life, estate and honour, of many a servant of God.\n\nIn fine, a strange disaster occurred during this time of enjoyment, when the capacious soul of his Majesty was a palatial garden of mirth and rejoicing. A desolating report came that M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was strife-mongering and that he had suddenly fallen upon the city of K\u0101bul and brought it into his possession, and that Sherafkan had, heedless of the end of things, gone over to the M\u012brz\u0101. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s sanctified heart was troubled, firstly, by the fate of his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h; secondly, by sympathy for the citizens and subjects, who are a trust from the Creator, and who should be tended not less carefully than the children; thirdly, by the rebellious proceedings of the M\u012brz\u0101 and the results thereof. He addressed himself with celestial genius to the remedying of these disturbances, and displayed suitable solicitude for putting an end to the outbreak.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently the fact referred to in Note 3.\n\n\\(^2\\) Referring to the bitter lakes met with in a desert, the Marah of the Hebrews.\n\n\\(^3\\) N\u0101\u1e63iya-i-qab\u016bla\u0161\u0101. Meaning, I suppose, that K\u0101mr\u0101n was offered the choice of greatness, and that his wickedness was enhanced by his misuse of his opportunities for well-doing.\nAnd Ab\u016bl Fa\u1e0dl, the writer of this noble record, turns away from amplitude of language, in order that he may give an account of events, and hastens towards narration, and gives a brief and parenthetical account of the circumstances so that the lips of those athirst for the waters of words may be satiated.\n\nThe description of the occurrence is as follows. When the army of fortune took Qandah\u0101r and came to the environs of K\u0101bul, and all the K\u0101bul army and all the people of that country were delighted at the good tidings of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s advent, and separated from the M\u012brz\u0101 and came in crowds and did homage, the M\u012brz\u0101 turned away from the path of advice and the road of obedience and loyalty and becoming a bewildered wanderer in the desert of perturbation and want took the road to Ghazn\u012bn. He forsook the blessing of service and absconded. M. Hind\u0101l, Mu\u1e63\u1e25\u012bb Beg and a number of others were sent after him, as has been related in the account of the taking of K\u0101bul. But when no trace of him could be found, and it was not known which way he had gone (lit. no dust rose up from his path) the pursuers returned in obedience to the royal commands and came to K\u0101bul. This M\u012brz\u0101 brought himself in all haste to Ghazn\u012bn. The rulers and inhabitants of that place were favoured by fortune, they strengthened the fort and did not open the gate of inclination for him. The M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s false representations were unsuccessful; so he hastened from these to the house of Kh\u012br Kh\u0101n Haz\u0101ra. He treated the M\u012brz\u0101 with hospitality and brought him to T\u012br\u012b, and from thence to Zamin D\u0101war. \u1e24is\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn \u2018Al\u012b, the son of M\u012br Khalifa, was in Zamin D\u0101war. He strengthened the fort and fought bravely, and courageously guarded the fort. When this news was brought to his Majesty he made over Ghazn\u012bn to M. Hind\u0101l and Zamin D\u0101war and its appurtenances to M. Ulugh, giving him also a standard, a kettle-drum and a tuman t\u016bgh. He also sent an order to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n to join Y\u0101dg\u0101r Na\u1e63\u012br M., who had come there (Qandah\u0101r) to act loyally, to M. Ulugh and to send them against M. K\u0101mr\u0101n. He also sent a rescript to Y\u0101dg\u0101r Na\u1e63\u012br M. to act in concert with M. Ulugh in putting down M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and by means of this service to move upwards on the steps of amendment of his past crimes. The M\u012brz\u0101s went together from Qandah\u0101r to Zamin D\u0101war, and when the news of their approach reached the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s camp, the Haz\u0101ras dispersed into the wilds and M. K\u0101mr\u0101n withdrew. He\nhurried off to Bhakkar and took refuge with Sh\u0101h \u1e24asan Argh\u016bn. M. Ulugh Beg took firm possession of his fief; and Y\u0101dg\u0101r Nas\u012br M. made as it were, a pilgrimage to the service of his Majesty. In K\u0101bul he learnt the bliss of service as has already been stated. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n came to a halt in Sind and married the daughter of the Ruler of Tatta, who had already been betrothed to him. He had stayed there for some time devising mischief when the news came of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s illness, which had occurred in Badakhsh\u0101n. After that there came other bad news. The M\u012brz\u0101 asked help from the Ruler of Tatta and resolved to go to K\u0101bul. The ruler of Tatta thought this a great opportunity and sent a body of troops with the M\u012brz\u0101. Some were of opinion that he should first seize Qandah\u0101r, and then go to K\u0101bul. But as Qandah\u0101r was secure under the control of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, K\u0101mr\u0101n set before himself the capture of K\u0101bul and boldly hastened there. Near Qil\u0101t he fell in with a number of Afgh\u0101n merchants who were bringing horses. He arbitrarily took the horses from them and gave them to his men. From thence he hastened to Ghazn\u012bn, and arrived there unexpectedly. Z\u0101hid Beg was holding the fort for M. Hind\u0101l and was spending his time in drunkenness and negligence. He was completely intoxicated on the night when the M\u012brz\u0101 arrived. By the help of the butcher \u2018Abdu-r-ra\u1e25m\u0101n, the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s men secretly ascended, and got possession of the fort. Z\u0101hid Beg was brought drunk before the M\u012brz\u0101, and the wretches cast him in his drunkenness from the pinnacle of life into the abyss of annihilation. The M\u012brz\u0101 left his son-in-law Daulat Sult\u0101n in Ghazn\u012bn, and leaving there also a number of men from Bhakkar under the leadership of Mulk Mu\u1e25ammad, who was a confidential servant of the Ruler of Tatta he went as rapidly to K\u0101bul. He arrived there at dawn without warning. He first went to the headdress-maker\u2019s gate. He learnt that Mu\u1e25ammad Tagh\u0101\u012b was in the hot bath, and it would appear that there too (referring to what occurred at Ghazn\u012bn) drunkenness had brought him into the stupor of cropsickness. \u2018Al\u012b Quli \u016aghl\u012b, one of the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s bodyguard, entered the bath and brought out Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u012b naked. The M\u012brz\u0101 gave him his ablution with the water of the sword, and entered the fort. Pahlw\u0101n Ashtar, who had charge of the Iron Gate, opened it in accordance with a compact, and the M\u012brz\u0101 entered the city, which now came into his possession. On the morning when\nthis occurrence took place, H\u00e1ji Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Asas came and saluted the M\u00edrz\u00e1. The latter said \u2018How have I gone and how have I come back?\u2019 \u2018Asas replied \u201cYou went in the evening and you came in the morning.\u201d The M\u00edrz\u00e1 went up to the citadel and took up his quarters there. Shamsu-d-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1n Atka brought his Majesty the Sh\u00e1hins\u00e1b\u00e1h with all reverence before M. K\u00e1mr\u00e1n. The M\u00edrz\u00e1, on beholding that theatre of miracles involuntarily became gracious and gentle. He shewed him various favours, but from short-sightedness put his Majesty, who was under the shadow of the protection of God, into the charge of his own men.\n\nWhen M. K\u00e1mr\u00e1n had brought K\u00e1bul into his possession, he practised various kinds of cruelty and opened his hands to shed people\u2019s blood and to seize their property. He caused Mihtar W\u0101\u1e63il and Mihtar Wakil, who were special royal slaves, to be blinded. His\u0101mu-d-d\u00edn \u2018Al\u00ed, son of M\u00edr Khalifa, whom his Majesty had summoned to his personal service, and whose fief he had transferred to Ulugh M\u00edrz\u00e1, had come about this time to K\u00e1bul and K\u00e1mr\u00e1n in revenge for his firmness at Zam\u00e1n D\u00e1war had him castrated and put to death in a most horrible manner. C\u00fali Bah\u00e1dur too, who was a loyal and approved servant, was put to death, and Khw\u00e1ja Mu\u2019azzam, Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, Atka Kh\u00e1n, Nad\u00edm K\u00f3ka and many other household servants were put into prison. The M\u00edrz\u00e1 thus prepared for himself spiritual and temporal ruin, and an evil name in realm and religion, He was continually tempting and ruining men by deceitful letters. Among such was Sherafkan who was induced to desert; and \u1e24asan Beg K\u00f3ka and Sult\u00e1n Mu\u1e25ammad Bakhsh\u00ed were by lies brought to separate themselves (from Hum\u00e1y\u00fan). Insincere, low dispositioned ones of narrow capacity for the idea of a small advantage put the dust of the world into the cup of their avarice and trod the path of disloyalty. And it appears that the main cause of the capture of K\u00e1bul was the discord of men and their negligence and want of vigilance and circumspection. For at that time Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Al\u00ed Tagh\u00e1\u00ed was D\u00e1rogha of the city for his Majesty Jah\u00e1nb\u00e1ni, but he continually took the path of carelessness, and did not apply the\n\n---\n\n1 Ferighta says that \u2018Asas was B\u0101ber\u2019s jester. He adds that \u2018Asas went on to quote a verse in K\u00e1mr\u00e1n\u2019s honour.\n\n2 Cf. Gulbadan\u2019s Memoirs. She mentions that K\u00e1mr\u00e1n tried to make her write a letter to her husband, inviting him to join him.\nrules of wariness. Fa\u1e63\u012bl Beg too set up for himself a separate scheme (lit. a separate shop) in the city and had ideas of becoming independent (of Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018Ali). From smallness of capacity and inefficiency they opposed one another and struck an axe on their own foot. When K\u0101bul fell into the hands of the M\u012brz\u0101 he set about collecting troops and in arranging for sedition. A large number collected round him. One day he was seated on the top of the citadel, and Walad Beg, Ab\u016bl Q\u0101sim and many others of the Sh\u0101h\u2019s bodyguard, who had got leave and were proceeding towards Persia came to pay their respects to the M\u012brz\u0101. His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h was also adorning the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s banquet with the light of his presence. All the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s confidential servants were set upon rapacity (darpai akhz \u016b jar), and the men round about, who were like flies at the stall of a sweetmeat-seller, were falling upon one another. A good service presented itself to Ab\u016bl Q\u0101sim, and he whispered to Walad Beg that it would be a loyal act if they who were thirty active men should do a brave deed in unison, finish off the M\u012brz\u0101, and glorify this young plant of the springtide of dominion and fortune, to wit, his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h. Walad Beg, who was not a man of war, showed backwardness towards this proposal and said \u201cWe are travellers, why should we intermeddle\u201d? As the top-thread of every act is bound to some special point of time what possibility was there of its appearing before that?\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nMARCH OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100N\u012a JANNA\u1e6c-\u0100SH\u012aY\u0100N\u012a FROM BADAKH\u0160H\u0100N TO K\u0100BUL, AND THE SIEGE THEREOF.\n\nWhen the news of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s strife and sedition reached the ears of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b he resolved, in spite of the extreme cold, and the abundance of ice and snow, to hasten by the defile of \u0100bdara,\u00b9 and to extinguish the flames of sedition. His first step was to send a gracious missive to M. Sulaim\u0101n, pardoning his offences and restoring that dismayed desert-wanderer to house and home, and exalting him by conferring on him the territories which his Majesty G\u012bti-sit\u0101n\u012b Firdaus-mak\u0101n\u012b had bestowed on his father. He confirmed M. Hind\u0101l in possession of Qand\u016bz, Andar\u0101b, Kh\u014dst, Kahmard and Gh\u014dr\u012b and its neighbourhood, and thereupon he, under the guidance of God, and in a most auspicious hour, turned the reins of intent towards K\u0101bul. On account of the protracted continuance of the ice and snow he stayed for some days in T\u0101liq\u0101n.\u00b2 The Uzbega looked upon his Majesty\u2019s return as a great gain and a grand escape, and one and all abode in peace and tranquillity. In fact the whole of T\u016br\u0101n was relieved from the dread of the grand army. When the snow had abated his Majesty moved from T\u0101liq\u0101n towards Qand\u016bz. M. Hind\u0101l showed him hospitality there, and in order to gratify the M\u012brz\u0101 his Majesty took up his quarters near the town in the garden of Khusr\u016b Sh\u0101h. After the \u2018\u012ad-i-Qurb\u0101n\u00b3 he marched by the pass of Shibart\u016b\u2074 to the pass of R\u0113gak,\u2075 and halted at Khw\u0101ja Seh Y\u0101r\u0101n.\n\n\u00b9 A pass in the Hindu Kush leading from Badakhsh\u0101n to K\u0101bul, and according to Bab\u0101r, Mem. 139, the only one open in the winter.

Sher 'Ali, who posed as one of the trusty and sincere followers of the Mirz\u0101, had strongly fortified the \u0100bdara defile; but what can outward force do against inward (i.e., Divine) aid? or human strength against the Divine support? He fled before M. Hind\u0101l and Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, but when the victorious cort\u00e9ge had passed through he came up from the rear and fell upon the baggage and the tents. When his Majesty had encamped at C\u0101r\u012bk\u0101r\u0101n, a large number, heedless of favours and of promises and covenants, deserted and joining M. K\u0101mr\u0101n obtained dignities (daraj\u0101t, lit. ascendings) which in reality were degradations (darak\u0101t, lit. descendings). Among these were Iskandar Sult\u0101n and M. Sanjar Barl\u0101s son of Sult\u0101n Junsaid\u00b9 Barl\u0101s, sister's son of his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101ni Firdausmak\u0101ni. His Majesty stayed in the borders of Zamzama, and exerted himself to strengthen the weak-hearted and the wavering. By compacts and covenants he knit up the hearts of the disheartened and convened a council. Those who received permission to speak represented that as M. K\u0101mr\u0101n had enclosed the city and made himself strong the proper course for them was to leave K\u0101bul and to encamp at B\u016bri and Khw\u0101ja Pushta, so that they might be able to provision the troops. All agreed to this, and they marched from Zamzama. When they had gone a little way it came into the inspired mind of his Majesty that it was not advisable to go to Khw\u0101ja Pushta for many of the men had their families in the city, and would desert in consequence. And many perhaps would think that the army was going to proceed to Qandah\u0101r. The proper thing to do was to summon up one's courage and take possession of the enclosing lines (gh\u0101hrband). If the Mirz\u0101 came out to fight, so much the better; and if he did not, the men would not desert, and also they would be sheltered to some degree from the inconveniences of the rainy season. He sent for H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and communicated to him this secret inspiration. He approved of the plan and it was settled accordingly. H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n with a body of troops proceeded by the way of the Min\u0101r pass while his Majesty set out\n\nand says it is above C\u0101r\u012bk\u0101r. Perhaps it is the Khawak pass, which is at the top of the Pang\u0101hir valley, and the pass by which Wood entered Afghanistan. See his Journey to the Source of the Oxus, 272.\n\n\u00b9 Junsaid was married to Shahr-b\u0101n\u016b, a younger sister of B\u0101bar and is often mentioned in the Memoirs.\nby the Pay\u0101n pass to conquer the city. The victorious troops had, under the leadership of M. Hind\u0101l, reached the neighbourhood of D\u0113h-Afgh\u0101n\u0101n and were near the shrine of B\u0101b\u0101 Shashpar when Sherafkan came out at the head of a large body of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s best men, and a hand to hand fight took place. Many of the imperial troops did not stand their ground. But M. Hind\u0101l remained firm, and gave proof of courage and devotion. When this state of things became apparent to his Majesty he directed Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, M\u012br Barka, and many others of the stamp of Sh\u0101h Quli N\u0101ranj\u012b\u00b9 and the like to advance and give a lesson to the rebels. They went forward, M\u012br Barka being ahead of them all, and meanwhile H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, and the body of men who had been dispatched in the direction above mentioned, came up, and the enemy was defeated. Sherafkan was made prisoner and brought before his Majesty. He being a mine of grace and gentleness was willing\u00b2 to confine him for some days so that he might get a lesson while in chains and return to his duty. But at the request of Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, and the urgency of all the loyalists who were enraged at his ingratitude and insincerity, he was put to death. His Majesty then proceeded towards K\u0101bul by the way of the khiy\u0101b\u0101n\u00b3 (avenue) while the imperial braves pursued the fugitives and arrived at the Iron Gate. Mirz\u0101 Khizr Kh\u0101n and a number of the Argh\u016bn\u012ban troops went off to the Haz\u0101raj\u0101t. The wall (shahrband) fell into the possession of the imperialists, and his Majesty halted that day in the garden of Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n. Many of the evil-disposed rebels, who had been made prisoners on the field of battle, were executed and Sher \u2018Ali was disconcerted\u2074 and took refuge in the citadel. Those who were distracted\u2075 there obtained repose.\n\nHis Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b visited afterwards the Diw\u0101nkh\u0101na and Urta B\u0101gh gardens, and took up his quarters on the hill of \u2018Aq\u0101bin\u2076\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann 480 and 596.

Guns and culverins (zarbzanh\u0101) were placed in position and discharged. Every day M. K\u0101mr\u0101n's men came out and had hand to hand conflicts. Mahdi Kh\u0101n, his relation Calma Beg,\u00b9 B\u0101b\u0101 S\u2018aid Qibc\u0101q, Ism\u2018ail K\u016bz,\u00b2 Mull\u0101 Mabtal\u0101i Auji, and some other ill-fated ones fled from the victorious army, and joined the M\u012brz\u0101. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b ordered Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, and a number of others to seek for an encamping ground in front of the Y\u0101rak gate\u00b3 for that was the proper place for taking post. He also directed that the siege-operations should be brought nearer to the fort, and that the charge of the batteries should be distributed, and the M\u012brz\u0101 be pressed more closely. The persons deputed were searching for a site when 30 or 40 men came suddenly out from the Y\u0101rak gate. H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n attacked them and as they were not able to keep their ground they fled towards the fort. Meanwhile Sher \u2018Ali came from inside the fort and engaged H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, and inflicted a severe wound on his right arm. During this conflict the imperialists pressed forward and drove Sher \u2018Ali inside the fort. They lifted up H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, who was faint and powerless, and carried him to his quarters. He was ill for a long time, and it was reported that he was dead. His Majesty sent a messenger to him requesting that he would get on horse-back and come to the batteries. He mounted his horse in obedience to the request, and the market of the foes-joy fell flat. One day M. Sanjar son of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Junaid who had gone off with the brand of faithlessness on his brow came out and attacked. His horse became unmanageable\u2074 and carried him as far as the Violet-Garden. He was made prisoner and brought before his Majesty who granted him his life, but sent him to prison.

It is shakh jal\u016b in B\u0101yaz\u012bd from whom A.F. probably took the expression.\n\u2075 Blochmann 380 and 485. It was Q\u0101sim who built the Agra Fort.\nPahlw\u0101n D\u014dst Mir Barr\u00b9 and who are now among the great officers, and have attained to high rank, threw themselves down from a bastion between the Iron Gate and the bastion of Q\u0101sim Birl\u0101s, and in the \u2018Aq\u0101b\u012bn received the blessing of doing homage and like a brace of eagles\u00b2 (\u2018aq\u0101b\u012bn) clutched the prey of everlasting good fortune.\n\nWhile this fighting was going on a large caravan arrived from abroad (wil\u0101yat)\u00b3 at C\u0101rik\u0101r\u0101n. There were many horses in it and other goods. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n sent Sher \u2018Ali with a body of trusty adherents to take possession of those goods, though Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Jang Jang, who was one of the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s trusted followers, protested, and plainly said that if his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b should hear of it and send his men and block their way so that they should not be able to rejoin the M\u012brz\u0101, they would be lost, and at the same time the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s purpose would not be affected. The M\u012brz\u0101 had his eyes fixed on the goods and would not receive this warning, and sent his men under the leadership of Sher \u2018Ali. As soon as the news reached his Majesty H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n was appointed to the service of restraining those tyrants from their plunder. H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad represented that the force had gone off at night and had done their work, and that if they followed them and failed to meet with them, they would escape. He suggested that the points commanding the roads and fords should be seized so that they should not be able to get inside the fort. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b agreed and himself came down from the hill and gave directions for occupying the stations and places of access. Sher \u2018Ali and Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Jang Jang and the others who had reached the merchants forcibly took possession of their goods, and much thereof was plundered. On returning they wanted to enter the fort, but found the roads and fords closed against them. Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad and Sher \u2018Ali had an altercation and Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Jang Jang said \u201cSee, my words have come true\u201d! Though they looked right and left, they could find no way of re-entering. They were dumbfounded and withdrew, and waited for an opportunity of getting in by stratagem.\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann 485 and VI where it is stated that the title means superintendent of the Imperial Forests.\n\u00b2 A.F. puts on the name of the ridge where Hum\u0101y\u016bn was.\n\u00b3 B\u0101yaz\u012bd says the horses came from Balkh.\nOne day B\u0101q\u012b \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25, who was one of the valiant men of the garrison, eagerly brought M. K\u0101mr\u0101n near the Iron Gate, and boastingly said that by one sally he would bring Sher \u2018Al\u012b in by this gate. When they opened the gate a number of the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s braves came out. The men of the battery, such as Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n Mauj\u012b, Q\u0101sim Mukhli\u1e63, and Jamil Beg came forward and showed alacrity and courage. Sumbul Kh\u0101n and 60 or 70 slaves did good execution with their muskets. Jamil Beg was martyred, and B\u0101q\u012b \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25, who was the cause of this disturbance, was killed by a bullet, and Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Beg, who was one of the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s confidants, was severely wounded. Many others also were wounded. They failed in their object and closed the gate of the fort. Sher \u2018Al\u012b despaired of entering the fort and hurried off to Ghazn\u012bn. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b despatched after him Kh\u012br Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101n, Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Beg, Ism\u0101il Beg D\u016bld\u0101i, and a large body of troops in order that they might by dint of courage make those luckless ones prisoners. They came up with Sher \u2018Al\u012b at the Sajawand pass, and an engagement took place. The imperialists were victorious, and many horses and goods fell into their hands. Many prisoners were also made. Sher \u2018Al\u012b escaped with a few men to the Haz\u0101raj\u0101t and took refuge in the house of Kh\u012br Kh\u0101n. The imperialists returned victorious with much booty and were rewarded by boundless favours. The plundered merchants, who had taken protection at the holy court, were told to take whatever goods and horses they recognised, and thus many horses and goods were restored to their owners. This occurrence was a revival of fortune. The rebel prisoners were brought in front of the batteries and publicly put to death with varied punishments so that those who were slumbering on the bed of error might be aroused.\n\nWhen there was no entrance or egress by any gate, and by no door could he obtain victory for his designs, and no road was open save that of failure, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n set himself in his evil mind to punish\n\n1 According to Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, he deserted to Hum\u0101y\u016bn along with Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Beg, Elliot, V. 225.

He made over\u00b9 the wife of B\u0101b\u016bs to the people of the bazaar, and spilled upon the ground, with cruel tortures, the blood of his three boys, one of whom was seven, the other five, and the third three years old, and flung them down from the top of the fort to near the batteries of Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n and Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Beg. He also hung upon the battlements Sird\u0101r Beg the son of Qar\u0101ca Beg and Khud\u0101 D\u014dst the son of Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Beg, and sent a message to them to come and see him, or to let him depart, or to withdraw the king from the siege. Otherwise he would kill their sons as he had done those of B\u0101b\u016bs. Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, who was then prime minister, cried out with a loud voice, \u201cGod save His Majesty the king. Our houses and homes and our children must one day perish, and their non-existence cannot be avoided. What better thing can there be than their coming to an end in the path of their master and benefactor. What are children when our lives are a sacrifice for His Majesty. Depart from those vain thoughts, and come and humbly submit, which will prove your salvation and be the ornamentation of your life, so that as your well-wishers we may do for you the utmost in our power. Why do you frighten us by killing our children? If our children be really put to death, revenge for that is at hand.\u201d His Majesty sent for Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n and Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Beg and soothed them by sympathetic words and favours. The Mirz\u0101 struck at men\u2019s honour and reputation by most unseemly conduct towards their women and children. He suspended the wife of Muhammad Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n Mauj\u012b by the breasts\u00b2 (pist\u0101n basta). And inasmuch as the Mirz\u0101 was sick with vexation and envy, every opposition which he in appearance made against His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was really resistance and opposition to the Almighty Creator. Every act of such a tyrant must inevitably fail of success, and in the end becomes the cause of his temporal and spiritual ruin.\n\n\u00b9 B\u0101yaz\u012bd says he made her over to an improper man (or men), ba mardum-i-n\u0101-mun\u0101sib sipurd, and killed the two sons, aged 10 and 12.\n\n\u00b2 B\u0101yaz\u012bd says she was hung up over the Iron Gate.\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nDisplay of Great Marvels on the Part of His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h, and the Taking of K\u0101bul.\n\nM. K\u0101mr\u0101n in his folly and want of wisdom brought, for the sake of his own protection, that nursling of the garden of sovereignty and that new fruit of the springtide of the Khilafat\u2014viz., his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h\u2014in front of the guns, and kept him in a place where it was difficult, on account of the marksmen (qadr-and\u0101z\u0101n) of the victorious army, for an ant or a grasshopper to pass. What humanity was this? Or what beast of prey or demon has such principles? Why did the tongue of him who gave such an order not grow dumb, and the arm of him who executed it not refuse its office when it encompassed that tree of fortune and planted it for such a purpose? The eye which could not see the manifest claims of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2014an elder brother, a venerated father\u2019s representative and a benefactor\u2014; how could it perceive the world-adorning beauty of his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h when concealed within the veil of honour, and when it was immature and in the dawn? How shall a heart which from the anguish of envy is trodden under foot of sorrow and is at enmity with Almighty God, perceive the rays of Divine light when enclosed in a human form? How shall he who cannot see the right path for himself divine the proper course for another? And inasmuch as the Divine Wisdom watched over that exhibition of hidden lights and kept him in the shelter of guardianship and the shadow of protection from evils and perils, and was surety for the safety of that Unique of the Age, it did not bring those wicked tyrants in a moment to the punishment of their deeds. Rather the design and intent of Providence with regard to those regardless ones had predetermined that they should be tossed about in the world and cast into the ashes of calamity and contempt, and by the revolutions of Time, degree by degree, and step by step, be brought\\(^1\\) into\n\n\\(^1\\) There is the variant guzarish, payment or retribution, and this is\ndissolution (guddayish), and that the wicked actions of the should be flung gradually into the bosom of retribution, by beholding the final retribution other wrong-doers may warning. Assuredly, when such things are looked upon purged vision, the recompense and retribution which come evidence by degrees and step by step is severer and more exhaustive torments!\n\nWhen the evil act (the exposure of Akbar) of this ungodly crew was executed, the hands of the marksmen trembled, the flew crooked, and the lintstocks congealed. Sumbul Khan, the fireworker, felt his ardent soul grow cold, and thought within himself \"What can have happened?\" God be praised! What evil-thought ones imagine to be failure and so press on in their wickedness becomes a means of perfection and an admixture of security! This was instanced here. Firstly, that by being protected in no peril a place by God from the strokes of seldom-missing marksmen, of wondrous musketeers, shame was wrought for the wicked and blackhearted, and the beauty of instruction was conferred on all seekers after righteousness; and, secondly, that the miracle of fires displaying coldness and of lintstocks not becoming slight was manifested. When Sumbul Khan's eyes fell on the object of (masga-i-tir, the lighting-place of the arrow), his powers of mind were quickened and he recognized his Majesty the Shahinshah. The horror of the sight almost drove the souls out of the bodies of spectators, and the gunners became as dead men (qalab tahi kana emptied their bodies). The mystery became revealed to Sumbul Khan, and he understood why the fires had gone out. In a moment he withdrew his hand from the battery, and the dejected crew traitors (firga-i mutafurriqa-i baghia) were respited for a time from the severity of the royal artillery. Wherever God's protection stands sentinel o'er His Chosen One, what power have his stratagems to do him wrong? Though fools exhibited the unbecoming act, yet the Divine plan required the revelation of the mystic and was the exponent of this truth, so that mortals might have explanation of the miracle and that every one might, in proportion to his intellect and capacity, reflect upon its nature and might, accor\n\nsupported by B.M.

H.M. assigned them a battery by the Y\u0101rak Gate. Those right-minded men girt up their loins for service and the valiant heroes displayed more and more alacrity and energy and pressed the Mirz\u0101 more and more closely. When all his schemes failed, he turned like a fox to fawning and to feline hypocrisy and came forward with protestations of shame and repentance and with blandishments. He represented through Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n that he regretted the past and was desirous of entering into service and of making amends for the past, so that he might win over his Majesty's appreciative heart by acceptable services. Might now his life and estate be under the o'ershadowing protection of his Majesty's clemency as the offering of his shame and penitence. His Majesty by virtue of his noble nature accepted his statements and ordered the siege-operations to be slackened. As M. Hind\u0101l, Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Beg and many of the other officers had not freely quaffed the sweet waters of loyalty they, from regard to their own interests, which is a note of old, discord-loving service, did not wish the Mirz\u0101 to make his submission. Why should I mention sincerity and loyalty? These are priceless jewels and rarely-found gems. If they be scarce among Turanians, in whose country they have long ceased to be procurable, what marvel is it? But they had not even the practical sense, which is the surety for one's own loss and gain, to do good in return for good. Those blind-hearted ones returned evil for good.

How were their thoughts linked together, or what consistent ideas did they possess? If they had understood even the lowest stages of loyalty, which carries with it so many blessings, they had never approved of thus endamaging themselves. If they were unacquainted with the sanctuary of loyalty, what had become of the bazaar of common sense that this faction did not come to know of it? If the ear of their understandings did not tell them of this, would that they had known the depression of sorrow and so not have struck so sharp a hatchet into their own feet.\n\nAt length that faction for their own evil designs terrified the Mirz\u0101, and sent a message to him saying, \"with what hope do you remain in the fort, or with what hope will you come to the Presence. Day by day the siege-operations are becoming more and more complete, you should get out quickly by a certain battery;\" and they referred him to the battery of Hasan Quli \u0100q\u0101. The Mirz\u0101, in accordance with this advice, came out by the Delhi Gate at the place which they had pointed out to him, on the night of Thursday, the 7th Rabi' al-awwal 954, 27th April, 1547, and absconded. He went towards Badakhsh\u0101n, thinking that he might perhaps do something with the help of M. Sulaim\u0101n, or, failing that, might be helped by the Uzbegs. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b appointed H\u0101ji Muhammad Kh\u0101n and a body of troops to pursue him, and entered the city of K\u0101bul, which had been a wilderness of rebellion, and made it by his advent a pleasant home of friendliness. His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, a station of endless marvels, went forth to meet him and was made fortunate by entering the Presence. The chaste ladies also did homage. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b on beholding his Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, displayed in heart and countenance fresh light and glory. What greater blessing could there be than this, that the eyes of a Jacob should be brightened by the beauty of a Joseph? Or what sublimer repose could there be than that the heart of such a sage (\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib d\u012bl) should be comforted by union with such a darling? In thanksgiving for the safety of the holy personality (Akbar), and for his well-being, he made vows, prayers, and alms, and applied fresh balm to the wounded hearts of mankind which were bleeding from the oppression of circumstances. Each one was soothed and comforted by manifold sympathies and consolations, and the distractions\nof pained hearts were changed into concords.\\footnote{This seems to be taken from Gulbadan Begam's Memoirs.} His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h took their seat with the lustre of dominion and the magnificence of prestige on the throne of victory and the masnad of honour. Though H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad and the others who had been sent in pursuit of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n came up with him, they out of the glamour and fascination of old and disloyal service, let him\\footnote{According to Jauhar it was Hind\u0101l who came up with K\u0101mr\u0101n as he was escaping on a man's back and who out of brotherly compassion let him go and supplied him with a horse. Nig\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn says H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad turned back on account of some Turki words used by K\u0101mr\u0101n. What they meant is rather obscure, but apparently he ironically asked H\u0101j\u012b if he had killed his father that he should be so keen in pursuing him. See Elliot V., 227, and Bad\u0101oni, Ranking's translation, p. 581.} go as if they had not seen him. The Mirz\u0101 slipped away but \u0100q Sult\u0101n\\footnote{K\u0101mr\u0101n's son-in-law and Gulbadan Begam's brother-in-law. Her account is that he afterwards left K\u0101mr\u0101n and retired to Mecca.} and a number of other followers were made prisoners. They were subjected to a just scrutiny and each received a punishment suitable to his offences. Among them, Sult\u0101n Qul\u012b Atka, Tars\u016bn Mirz\u0101, a relation of \u2018Abdull\u0101h Mirz\u0101, \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Maq\u1e63\u016bd, Maul\u0101n\u0101 B\u0101q\u012b \u012argh\u016b,\\footnote{Or y\u0101rgh\u016b. It is a Turkish or Mongolian word, and one of its meanings is prefect. See Vullers s.v.} Maul\u0101n\u0101 Qadam Arb\u0101b, and many others who were the ringleaders of strife and sedition were punished capitally. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n resolved upon flight, and arranged with his men that he would take refuge at the hill of Ist\u0101lif, and that he would collect troops and prepare war. At the end of the night he went secretly towards Badakhsh\u0101n along with \u2018Ali Qul\u012b Q\u016brc\u012b by the way of Sanjad Dara. After a thousand (ha\u1e93\u0101r) distresses he passed on from the Haz\u0101raj\u0101t with thousands of disgraces and ignominies towards Badakhsh\u0101n. M. Beg, who was one of his confidants, and Sher \u2018Ali joined him with a few men near Zuhh\u0101k. When they got to Gh\u014dr\u012b he sent a message to M. Beg Birl\u0101s the ruler of that place and summoned him to his presence. He replied that disloyalty, the note of the wicked, would not come from him. The Mirz\u0101 wished to pass by Gh\u014dr\u012b but one of his servants (galaqci\u0101n qu. gal\u016bqci\u0101n)\\footnote{abused him and said, \u201cWhy do you go with this fellow, (meaning...\nthe M\u012brz\u0101), who if he was the son of his Majesty G\u016bt\u012b Sit\u0101n\u012b and had a drop of his spirit would never have let off the governor of Gh\u014dr\u012b so tamely or have left him scatheless.\u201d The M\u012brz\u0101 was stung by his taunts and said, \u201cWhy do you talk so idly and why don\u2019t you reflect? I am acting in this way because of your want of preparation; would I have let the thing pass in this way if you were equipped for war\u201d? The madman again spoke roughly to the M\u012brz\u0101, and he turned back and fought with the governor of Gh\u014dr\u012b. The latter was defeated and Gh\u014dr\u012b fell into the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s hands. Thus he got possession of some munitions of war. He left Sher \u2018\u0100li there and went on to Badakhsh\u0101n. He sent a messenger to M. Sulaim\u0101n and M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, inviting them to assist him, but they wisely did not give up their loyalty to the king, and were on their guard against helping the M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nM. K\u0101mr\u0101n, being led away by his vain thoughts, went on towards Balkh in order that he might take refuge with P\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and with his help get possession of Badakhsh\u0101n. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b appointed Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n to the Badakhsh\u0101nat, so that he might in concert with M. Sulaiman and M. Hind\u0101l and the other officers get possession of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n or drive him away. Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n came to Badakhsh\u0101n and went to Gh\u014dr\u012b along with the M\u012brz\u0101s. Sher \u2018\u0100li and some of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s men were garrisoned there. Brave fightings took place and gallant men on both sides were killed. Among them was Khw\u0101ja N\u016br, who was one of M. Hind\u0101l\u2019s great men. Mull\u0101 Mir Kit\u0101bd\u0101r, who was a favourite of M. Hind\u0101l, also obtained martyrdom. At last the besieged could resist no longer and fled, and the fort fell into the hands of the king\u2019s servants. Meanwhile news came that M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and P\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n had arrived from Balkh. The M\u012brz\u0101s did not engage, but turned back into the defiles while Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n proceeded towards K\u0101bul. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b on hearing of the confusion in Badakhsh\u0101n turned his rein in that direction. When he reached Gh\u016brband, Qar\u0101ca Khan came and did homage. But as Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n\u2019s baggage had been plundered on the way back (to Gh\u016brband?) by the Aim\u0101qs, he was permitted to go to K\u0101bul in order that he might collect materials and quickly join. His Majesty, on his account\n\n---\n\n1 Dar mur\u0101ja\u2019at, on the return journey, from Badakhsh\u0101n and Gh\u014dr\u012b, I presume.\nmarched from Gh\u00f6rband and halted at the village of Gulbih\u0101r and occupied himself in making excursions and in hunting till Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n arrived. After Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n came, though the season was over, his Majesty adhered to his first resolve and proceeded towards Badakhsh\u0101n. As the designs of Providence were not in accordance with this expedition, the passes of the Hindu K\u014dh were made difficult by snow, and a strange confusion occurred in the pass so that it was difficult to cross. In accordance with expediency, he returned to K\u0101bul, resolving that in spring he would turn towards Badakhsh\u0101n.\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nTHE PUTTING1 HIS MAJESTY THE SH\u00c2H\u00ceNSH\u00c2H TO SCHOOL, AND OTHER EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED AT THIS TIME.\n\nAs it is fixed and recorded in the Academy of Divine knowledge, which is the \"guarded tablet\" of sempiternal writings\u2014and all the arts and sciences in that sanctuary of the presence are the offspring of instruction's school\u2014that the possessors of the new\n\n---\n\n1 There is a reference later on, text I. 316, to Akbar's teachers. We are told of them that 'A\u1e63\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn the first teacher was removed for his addiction to pigeon-flying. This was a taste which he communicated to his pupil, if indeed the boy did not inherit it from his great-grandfather 'Umar Shaikh, and did not lead astray his luckless preceptor, for we are told, Blochmann 299, that when Akbar was very young he was fond of pigeon-flying and that he took up the pursuit again in mature life. There is also in the Ma\u1e63g\u00eer-i-Ra\u1e25\u00eem\u00ee MS. A.S.B., p. 808b, et seq., a long letter about pigeons from Akbar to the Kh\u00e2n-kh\u00e2n\u00e2n. Akbar's second teacher was Maul\u0101n\u0101 B\u0101yaz\u00eed, a physician and a descendant of one of Ulugh Beg's astronomers, but he too was objected to, and finally Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn drew lots as to which of three persons should be his son's tutor. The result was that Maul\u0101n\u0101 'Abdu-l-Q\u00e2dir was appointed. He belonged to Tabriz and was brother of Abul Q\u00e2sim who became Diw\u00e2n of Gujr\u00e2t, Blochmann 485 and 545.\n\nBut 'Abdu-l-Q\u00e2dir seems to have been superseded in his turn for we find that in the second year of his reign, that is, when he was 15, Akbar made M\u00eer 'Abdu-l-la\u1e6d\u00eef his tutor. Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u00een mentions in his list of the learned men a Mull\u00e2 'Al\u00e2'ud-d\u00een as Akbar's tutor. He also mentions that Mull\u00e2 'Abdu-l-Q\u00e2dir retired to Mecca after having for years discharged with credit the duties of Akbar's teacher. The truth, as far as it can be seen through the maze of A.F.'s rhetoric, seems to be that Akbar was an idle boy, fond of animals and out-door amusements, and that he would not learn his lessons. This is corroborated by Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer's description of him as an unlettered man, and one who in his youth was fond of the pleasures of the table. It seems probable too that Akbar never knew how to read and write. This seems extraordinary in the son of so learned a man as Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn, but apparently the latter was not to blame for this. See text I. 316.\nmaterial of reason are to be brought, on the emergence of articulate speech, to learn the combinations of letters (bur\u016bf-i-murakkaba) and to acquire general knowledge, viz., that which has been put together by united cares and intellectual essays, and by special progressions and classifications to walk in the beaten paths of reason, so this scholar of the Divine Academy and graduate of God's college was, in compliance with use and wont, taken to man's school on 7th Shaww\u0101l of this year, 20th November, 1547, being the fourth year, fourth month and fourth day of the eternity-conjoined life of his Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h. The weighty office was conferred on the Mull\u0101z\u0101da Mull\u0101 (teacher the son of a teacher) \u2018A\u1e63\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. Though in the eyes of the superficial his Majesty was taken to be taught, yet according to the view of the far-seeing he was carried to the lofty position of teacher. A strange thing was that his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, who was acquainted with celestial sciences and versed in the mysteries of the stars, had fixed, in consultation with acute astrologers and time-knowing astrolabe-conners, a special hour for the initiative of his Majesty's instruction, such as might happen once during cycles and lifetimes, but when the master-moment arrived that scholar of God's school had attired himself for sport and had disappeared! In spite of all endeavours and of sedulous search on the part of royalty, no trace of him could be found. The enlightened-hearted perceived from this wondrous mystery that the design was that this lord of lofty wisdom and special pupil of God should not be implicated and commingled with ordinary human learning, so that at the time of the revelation of this Khedive of subtlety it might be apparent to mankind that the knowledge of this king of knowers was of the nature of a gift, and not of an acquirement. In spite of this truth, however, letters and the current sciences manifest themselves gloriously in his Majesty's sanctified mind, whether they be those committed to writing by scientists, or such niceties and secrets as come from Wisdom's source without the intervention of teaching and being\n\n---\n\n1 The year must have been 954 for we are told in a previous chapter that Hum\u0101y\u016bn left Qand\u016bz in the last month of 953, and Akbar was at this time 5 years, 3 months, and 2 days old, for he was born on 5th Rajab, 949, or if we take the Gregorian calendar he was 5 years, 1 month, 5 days old, viz., from 15th October, 1542\u201420th November, 1547.\ntaught (ta'lim \u016b ta'allum). Accordingly when masters of wisdom, lords of the mathematics, those possessed of exoteric sciences, and the inheritors of all the arts, whether general or specific, reach the carpet of the holy Presence, they from a consciousness of their own ignorance sink the head of ashamedness in the collar of hesitancy, and abide in amazement. The inspired nature of his Majesty is strongly drawn to the composing of Hindi and Persian poetry and is critical and hair-splitting in the niceties of poetic diction. Among books of poetry, he recites off-hand the Maulavi's\\(^1\\) Maqnavi and the Diwan of the \"mystic-tongue,\" and takes delight in their verities and beauties. The following weighty verse is a product of his Majesty's meditations.\n\nVerse.\n\n'Tis not the chain of insanity on the neck of the afflicted Majnun;\nLove hath laid a loving hand on his neck.\n\nHe has also strung glorious thoughts in the Hindi language, which may be regarded as masterpieces in this kind.\n\nVerse.\n\nOh Thou congeries of excellencies, how may I express thee!\n\nIn fine, after they had kept him for some time with that meritorious teacher, engaged in recitations which were worse than none, those who only regarded externals dwelt upon the inefficiency of the tutor and set themselves to get rid of him. That helpless one was superseded, and Maulana Bayazid was appointed. They did not know that the taskmasters of creation were taking care that the inspired mind of this nursling of Divine light should not become\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is Jalalu-d-din Rumi, and the mystic-tongue is Hafiz. The passage about the Hindi and Persian poetry is omitted in the Lucknow edition. It seems discrepant from Blochmann, 548, where A.F. tells us that Akbar did not care for poets. But see also id. 103, 104. Nor does the passage occur in B.M. MSS. 27, 247, 17, 926, 5610 and 6544. It is also absent from the I.O. MSS. Nos. 4 and 564, and is, I think, undoubtedly spurious. The passage to be omitted begins on last line of p. 270 of Bib. Ind. ed. at \u016b tabu' and goes down to alqissa on 7th line of 271.\nthe reception chamber of inky impressions or the alighting-stage of\nthe sooty types of the exoteric sciences.\n\nDuring this auspicious time his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was in K\u0101bul\narranging for the distribution of provinces and for an expedition to\nBadakhsh\u0101n, and for bringing to an end the affair of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n.\nM. K\u0101mr\u0101n came to despair of help from M. Sulaim\u0101n and M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm,\nand went off with evil thoughts to Balkh in order that he might with\nP\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n\u2019s help obtain possession of Badakhsh\u0101n.\nWhen he arrived at the village of Aibak\u00b2 the Governor thereof\nreceived him courteously, but kept him under surveillance, and\nreported the circumstance to P\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n. The latter\nregarded the M\u012brz\u0101\u2019s advent as a boon and sent trusty persons to\nwelcome him. He conveyed the M\u012brz\u0101 with all respect to his own\nhouse, and showed him hospitality. He also accompanied him to\nBadakhsh\u0101n. The M\u012brz\u0101s, in accordance with their resolve, retired\nto the mountainous borders of Badakhsh\u0101n, and much of that\ncountry came into the possession of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n. P\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad\nKh\u0101n left a body of troops for M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s assistance and returned\nto his own country. The M\u012brz\u0101 came to Kishm and T\u0101liq\u0101n, and\nsent Rafiq K\u014dka, and Kh\u0101liq Bardi with a body of Caghat\u0101i and Uzbeg\ntroops to R\u016bst\u0101q. M. Sulaim\u0101n and M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm collected the people\nof K\u016bl\u0101b and came against R\u016bst\u0101q. They came from Qil\u2018a Zafar\nand Khamalink\u0101n\u00b3 and fought bravely against Rafiq K\u014dka and the\nothers, but by heaven\u2019s decree they were defeated and had to with-\ndraw to the hill country. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was pleasing his\nenlightened heart in K\u0101bul, and his determination was that he\nwould go to Badakhsh\u0101n. As his servants\u2019 hearts were not sincere,\nthis design abode under the veil of dilatoriness and delay (ta\u2018aww\u016bq \u016b\ntaw\u0101qq\u016bf), and meanwhile Qar\u016bca Kh\u0101n, who had rendered good\nservice and had become a station for endless favours, let the goblet\nof his understanding brim over, for the vessel was tiny and the wine\nplenteous, and without reflecting on his performances, rank, and\ncondition, and on the lofty position of his master, set his foot outside\n\n\u00b9 He was the son of J\u0101n\u012b Beg and\nuncle of the famous \u2018Abdull\u0101h Kh\u0101n.\nHe died in 974 (1566).

So at length out of the stupidity which is natural to the immoderately exalted he uttered words which even the drunk and mad do not use. Among them was the expression of his wish that Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi, who as a reward for his abilities and good service had been appointed to the office of Diw\u0101n, should be sent to him bound in order that he might put him to death,\u00b9 and that his office should be given to Khw\u0101ja Q\u0101sim T\u016bla.\u00b2 As such a measure did not commend itself to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, who was a spring of justice and compassion, Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, who in his vain thoughts imagined himself to be the pillar of the victorious dominion, seduced, in the blackness of his fortune, and inversion of his horoscope, a large body of men from the path, and went off towards Badaksh\u0101n. B\u0101b\u016bs, Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Beg, Ism\u0101il Beg Duld\u0101, \u2018Al\u012b Quli\u00b3 of Andar\u0101b, \u1e24aidar D\u014dst Moghal, Shaikham Khw\u0101ja Khizri and Qurb\u0101n Qar\u0101wal with nearly 3000 veteran horsemen, all of whom had been enticed by him, went off by Kotal Min\u0101r en route for Badaksh\u0101n and so trod the wilderness of error.\n\nWhen his Majesty heard of this he wished to go off at once in person after those ill-fated ones who had turned away from the altar of auspiciousness. From observance of the favourable hour (for starting), he delayed setting out himself and despatched some of his followers to pursue the wretches. According as each of his loyal servants came up he was sent off, and so Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n, Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n, Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Barl\u0101s, \u2018Abdull\u0101h Sult\u0101n and other loyalists hastened off, one after the other. Near midday, when the auspicious moment had arrived, his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b mounted the horse of victory. A number of gallant youths pressed forward, and coming up with the rearguard of those headstrong ones, engaged them and overcame them. At the end of the day they came to close quarters with Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n at the river;\u2074 night interposed to save the lives of those bleak-hearted ones, and they fled under its protection. They crossed by the Ghorband bridge, breaking it down\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Jauhar and B\u0101yazid give the reason for Qar\u0101ca\u2019s animosity. He had issued an order to Khw\u0101ja Gh\u0101zi for the payment of 10 t\u016bm\u0101ns, and the latter, who was treasurer, or finance-minister refused to honour the draft.\n\n\u00b2 T\u016bla may mean weighman.

Those who had followed them returned, and did homage at Qar\u0101 B\u0101gh. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s world-adorning mind decided to return to K\u0101bul, and there to make preparations and to proceed against Badakhsh\u0101n. The short-sighted fugitives left Tamar \u2018Ali Shigh\u0101l\u012b, who was Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n\u2019s vakil, in Panjsh\u012br, that he might collect news there of affairs in K\u0101bul, and having crossed a pass in the Hind\u016b K\u014dh joined M. K\u0101mr\u0101n in Kishm. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b returned next day and refreshed the Urta B\u0101gh by the sunshine of his presence. He gave appropriate nicknames to all those sordid ones who had not recognised their duties to their king, and had been unfaithful to their salt. Thus he styled Qar\u0101ca Qar\u0101 Bekht (black fortune), Ism\u0101il Kh\u012brs (bear), Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Mun\u0101fiq (hypocrite), and B\u0101b\u016bs Daiy\u016bs\u00b9 (wittol). And he sent orders to M. Hind\u0101l, M. Sulaim\u0101n, and M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm to make preparations and to await the coming of the grand army. An order was also issued for H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n\u2019s coming from Ghazn\u012bn to the Presence.\n\nDuring this time when the preparations for an expedition against Badakhsh\u0101n were engaging his mind, he was continually consulting prudent old men and wise young men, in whose foreheads there shone the jewel of sincerity. All those who had neither stout hearts nor clear vision urged the marching to Qandah\u0101r in order that preparations might be made there, and that thereafter they might proceed to quell the sedition of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n. Those who held in their hands the diploma of wisdom with the emblazonment of valour supported the royal idea of proceeding to Badakhsh\u0101n. One day he said to Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n\u00b2, \u201cWhat do you say\u201d? He replied, \u201cM. K\u0101mr\u0101n is uplifted by the desertion of those ingrates. It seems likely that he will anticipate us and come into these territories. It appears to me that if the imperial army cross the Hind\u016b K\u014dh first it will be victorious, otherwise\u2014God forbid it\u2014the dice will fall in another fashion.\u201d His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b said \u201cThe downfall of\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps a bitter allusion to the fact that B\u0101b\u016bs was rejoining a man (K\u0101mr\u0101n) who had given over B\u0101b\u016bs\u2019 wife to the people of the bazar. See supra. Probably Kh\u012brs, a winejar, was the nickname of Ism\u2019ail, rather than Kh\u012brs, for A.F. has previously called him k\u016bs, i.e., flagon.\n\n\u00b2 A grandson of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain of Her\u0101t.

Hum\u0101y\u016bn is represented there as saying \"God willing, we shall cross the hills first.\"\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nDeparture of His Majesty Jah\u0101nsh\u012br Jannat-\u0100shiy\u0101n\u012b's World-Conquering Army for Badakhsh\u0101n, and its Victorious Return to K\u0101bul.\n\nWhen the expedition had been determined upon\u2014and the measure was a most necessary one, they set off at an auspicious hour on Monday, 5th Jum\u0101da-al-awal, 955, 12th June, 1548, and encamped at Alang C\u0101l\u0101k. After two or three days, they moved from there to Qar\u0101 B\u0101gh, where they remained ten or twelve days on account of some state-affairs. In spite of some rumours about his disloyalty, H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n came as a well-wisher, and Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sultan, who was in Bangash, also came and did homage, and was favourably received. At the same stage, M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm under the guidance of an auspicious star came post-haste and paid his respects. The lights of special favour were shed on the forehead of his fortune. One of the wonderful things which were the heralds of countless victories was that when he was about to proceed to Badakhsh\u0101n, his Majesty was standing in the ewer-room. Suddenly it occurred to his sanctified mind that \"if this white bird (referring to a cock which was always in the room) come upon my shoulder and crow, it will be a sign of victory.\" As soon as he had this thought, the auspicious bird came flying and flapping its wings like a hum\u0101, perched on his shoulder, and cast an auspicious shadow over the head of fortune. His Majesty returned thanks, and ordered that a silver ring be put on the bird's foot.\n\nAmong the occurrences which were suitable preludes to victory was this that when M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm arrived at Panjsh\u012br Tamar Shigh\u0101li\n\n---\n\n1 The alung or meadow of C\u0101l\u0101k is mentioned by B\u0101bar, Mem. 138 as being one kos from K\u0101bul. He says it is extensive, but that the mosquitoes greatly annoy the horses.\n\n2 This story is told by Jauhar who adds that Hum\u0101y\u016bn used to feed the bird with raisins.\n\n3 Jarrett II, 399 n. and 411, and B\u0101bar 145.\ninterception him. Malik \u2018Ali of Panjshir joined the Mirz\u0101 with his clan, and M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm bravely engaged Tamar \u2018Ali Shigh\u0101l\u012b, and routed him. He brought Malik \u2018Ali of Panjshir along with him as a precautionary measure, and introduced him to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. This simple-minded well-wisher of the State was incommode by having to travel with M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, on account of groundless anxieties about his lands, and after a quarrel it came to fighting. Though the Mirz\u0101 had but few men with him he displayed great superiority and conducted his own party to the Presence. Next day Malik \u2018Ali sent his brother and preferred excuses for his offence, and he also sent the head of Tamar \u2018Ali. His Majesty rewarded the messenger with a robe of honour and other presents, and sent a soothing letter to his brother. He wrote that the Mirz\u0101 had not understood him, that his hereditary loyalty was patent to his Majesty\u2019s heart, and that when his Majesty came to his territory he would treat him with royal favours; his Majesty also treated M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm with much favour and called him his son. After bestowing royal benignities on him he gave him leave to depart in order that he might go and get M. Sulaim\u0101n ready with his army, and the munitions of war. He was to await the arrival of the royal army near Badakhsh\u0101n. When it reached T\u0101liq\u0101n, they were to come and join. The noble lady Miriam-Mak\u0101n\u012b and his Majesty the Sh\u0101hingh\u0101n, the light of the eyes of the Sult\u0101nate and the rose tree (gulbun) of the rose garden of the spring of the Khil\u0101fat, were sent off from the village of Gulbih\u0101r to K\u0101bul. Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim Mauj\u012b was appointed governor of K\u0101bul and sent with them. He was to continually serve his Majesty the Sh\u0101hingh\u0101n, and also to manage thoroughly the district. When his Majesty had halted at the village of B\u0101z\u0101rak in the T\u016bm\u0101n of Panjshir, H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad (son of\n\n---\n\n1 Ba\u1e63\u012br-i-n\u0101qis-i-samind\u0101r\u0101na. I presume that this is the meaning, but it may mean that Malik \u2018Ali was too independent to go with another man, and that too one who was only an heir-apparent.\n\n2 Perhaps he was a Yusufzai and a relative of Sh\u0101h Man\u1e63ar, son of Malik Sulaim\u0101n, whose daughter B\u0101bar married. Mem. 250.\n\n3 Gulb\u0101n in text, but it is Gulbih\u0101r in Lucknow ed., and this is probably correct as it agrees with B\u0101bar 154. See also 219, where B\u0101bar has some verses about Gulbih\u0101r. It lies N. of K\u0101bul, and as usual A.F. puns on the name.\n\n4 Jarrett, 399 and 400 n. 1.\nB\u0101ba Qushqa, Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sult\u0101n, Tard\u012b Beg, Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Barl\u0101s, \u2018Ali Quli Sult\u0101n, Mir Lat\u012bf, and \u1e24aidar Mu\u1e25ammad C\u016bli were sent as an advance-guard. As soon as they had crossed the Hind\u016b K\u014dh, Mahd\u012b Sult\u0101n, Tard\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Jang Jang, and the party who were in the fort of Andar\u0101b, fled. In accordance with the royal orders, Tard\u012b Beg and Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Barl\u0101s hastened to Kh\u00f6st in order to seize the families of the fugitives which were there. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, being drunk with the wine of arrogance, was in Qil\u2019a Zafar. Though the runaway officers in T\u0101liq\u0101n requested the Mirz\u0101 to guard the roads, and to block the route from K\u0101bul, they were not successful. Mull\u0101 Khirad Zargar, who was then in close contact with M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, and was a constant sedition-monger, made great efforts in this respect, but could not attain his object. At last Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n and his party took the precaution to send Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Beg to bring the families from Kh\u00f6st, lest a force should come from K\u0101bul and make them prisoners. Just at this time Tard\u012b Beg and Mu\u1e25ammad Quli arrived at Kh\u00f6st, and Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Beg took off the families to T\u0101liq\u0101n. Apparently this was done by the connivance which is the result of long service.\n\nWhen the royal standards approached Andar\u0101b, M. Hind\u0101l arrived from Qand\u016bz, and brought in Sher \u2018Ali as a prisoner. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b honoured the Mirz\u0101 with various favours. Among these was that he should pay his respects on horseback. The short account of the affair of Sher \u2018Ali is that before the arrival of the imperial troops in the Badakhsh\u0101nat, and when M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was in power there, Sher \u2018Ali in his arrogance always behaved disrespectfully to the Mirz\u0101, and urged the taking of Qand\u016bz and the bringing in of M. Hind\u0101l. At last the Mirz\u0101 appointed him to Qand\u016bz, and M. Hind\u0101l by the royal good fortune succeeded in making him prisoner. The thing happened thus. One night many of the infantry soldiers of Qand\u016bz surrounded his house (tent?).\n\n1 Ba rasm-i-manqul\u0101. But the meaning is that they were sent on in advance of the main army, and the word is properly manghul\u0101t and is Mongolian.\n2 Apparently this was a brother of Gulbadan\u2019s husband Khizr Khw\u0101ja.\n3 Jauhar states that Hind\u0101l arrived a watch after nightfall. He saw Hum\u0101y\u016bn afar off, and wanted to alight from his horse, but Hum\u0101y\u016bn made him keep his seat.\nHe fled and flung himself into the river, and broke his arm, and was caught in his own snare. When the Mirz\u0101 brought him before his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, the latter did not regard his improper actions, and drew the pen of forgiveness over his offences, and having given him a robe of honour nominated him to Gh\u014dr\u012b. For his far-seeing mind looked to his nature and his capabilities, and as he found in him manliness and administrative ability, he passed over so many great crimes, each of which was deserving of condign punishment, and distinguished him by favours. For in the scales of appreciation he found that the subjects of reward were more than those of retribution.\n\nAfter M. Hind\u0101l had been honoured by royal favours, an order was issued that H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and a number of others should advance as a vanguard (manqul\u0101), and that the Mirz\u0101 should head them. All were to obey the Mirz\u0101\u2014who would always be a supporter of dominion\u2014and not to fail in good service, so that each might be rewarded in proportion thereto. In the middle of Jum\u0101d\u0101-al-akhir 955, 22nd May, 1548, the camp reached the Q\u0101z\u012b\u2019s Alang, which is a village of Andar\u0101b. The Q\u0101z\u012b of Andar\u0101b and the men of the T\u016bqb\u0101i and S\u0101lq\u0101nc\u012b tribes, and the Bal\u016bcis and a number of soldiers and of the Aimaqs of Badakhsh\u0101n, and of the servants of Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Beg did homage, and received royal favours. From thence the army proceeded, march after march, to T\u0101liq\u0101n. Most of the fugitive officers, as well as Mirz\u0101 \u2018Abdull\u0101h and a number of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s men, were in garrison there. An order was issued to M. Hind\u0101l and the officers with him to cross the Bang\u012b river and engage. Just then M. K\u0101mr\u0101n hastily brought his men from\n\n---\n\n1 B\u0101yaz\u012bd tells us that Sher \u2018Al\u012b had been a servant of the unfortunate Y\u0101dg\u0101r N\u0101\u1e63ir.\n\n2 This is an Afgh\u0101n tribe, Jarrett, II. 403. I have not found the name S\u0101lq\u0101nc\u012b mentioned.\n\n3 The text has Tang\u012b, but the variant Bang\u012b is right. The Bang\u012b or Bung\u012b is a tributary of the Khair\u0101b\u0101d river, which again is a tributary of the Oxus. The Bang\u012b flows south of T\u0101liq\u0101n. See Wood\u2019s Journey to the source of the Oxus, p. 152.\n\n4 Jauhar says K\u0101mr\u0101n marched 25 kos from Qil\u2019a Zafar (K\u0101mr\u0101n seems to have been famous for his rapid movements), and that it was not till after sunrise that he was recognised. He drove back H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad, but when he heard Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s drums he cried, \u201cI\u2019ve lost the game,\u201d and retreated into T\u0101liq\u0101n.\nQila' Zaffar and Kishm and joined the unholy crew. On Saturday, 15th Jam\u0101da-al-akhir\u012b an engagement took place on a rising ground which they call khals\u0101n (?) The royal army had not yet crossed the river and there was some distance between the advance-guard and the main body. In accordance with the Divine Will, the imperial vanguard was turned back and had to recross the river. The enemy proceeded to plunder. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was stationed on the same rising ground with a few men. Meanwhile his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b arrived on the river bank and wished to cross in front of the enemy. Sundry faithful informants represented that the river was in a pool there, and that a mile higher up there was a mill, and that as the place was stony, it would be easy to cross there. They went there, and when they got nigh the mill, Shaikh\u0101 Khw\u0101ja Khizr\u012b, the kalantar (headman) of the Khw\u0101ja Khizr\u012bs was brought in a prisoner. The tinqat\u0101rs who were by his Majesty's rein were bidden to strike the faithless runagate. They so fisted and kicked him that the spectators felt certain that his black soul could no longer have connection with his body. In that place they captured Ism\u0101il Beg Duldai and brought him to the presence. His Majesty granted him his life, forgave him his offences at the intercession of Mun'\u0101m Kh\u0101n, and made him over to him. His Majesty then proceeded to the height where M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was. He appointed Fatah Ullah Beg, brother of R\u016bsh\u0101n K\u014dka to the vanguard, and sent forward with him a number of\n\n---\n\n1 As the army arrived at Andar\u0101b in the middle of the month and then made several marches there is probably a mistake in this date.\n\n2 Jauhar mentions that after the plundering was over, and the enemy had retreated to T\u0101l\u012bq\u0101n, it was reported to Hum\u0101y\u016bn that the library was safe. He was much pleased, saying, \"God be praised that things which cannot be replaced are safe! As for other things, they were a small matter.\"\n\n3 \u0100b jamjama ast; jum'ama means a skull in Arabic. Perhaps all that is meant here is that the waters of the river were collected together in the place.\n\n4 He had deserted along with Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n. Bay\u0101z\u012bd says the millers took him up and cared for him and that he became kalantar again and lived for several years. He was beaten with the stocks of muskets, &c. According to Jauhar, Hum\u0101y\u016bn ordered him to be split into nine strips; 42 wounds were inflicted on him, but at night he went off to his own house.\n\n5 This is mentioned as a clan in B\u0101bar, 277.\ndevoted heroes. A gallant engagement took place, and Farah was unhorsed. Just then the royal standard (kaukab), which preface of conquest and the advance-guard of victory, m appearance; the Mirz\u0101 gave up heart and had no power to resist fled to the fort of Taliq\u0101n, and set himself to strengthen its imperial army proceeded to plunder. A dispute arose among attendants (galaq\u010di\u0101n) about the goods, and his Majesty gave for haral, i.e., that every one should keep what came into his hand and others had no claim to it. In that victory no one had even hair of his head injured, excepting \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n. Isah\u0101q1 (his Sul\u1e6d\u0101n, Tardi Beg, the son of Beg Mirak, Babi J\u016bjak, and a number of others who had boldly followed the victorious were made prisoners. M. Hind\u0101l and H\u00e1ji Mu\u1e25ammad brought their prisoners to Presence, and his Majesty treated them according to the laws of justice and equity, and distributed favour and chastisement suitable to their deservings. And he returned thanks to the Court of the True Disposer, who is liberal without stint and bounteous without solicitation.\n\nNext day he commenced the siege and distributed the batteries.\n\nOne day a shot from the battery which was in charge of Mun\u0101r Kh\u0101n, Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Barlas and \u1e24usain Quli Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mu\u1e25d\u0101r, struck Mub\u0101riz Beg and killed him. His Majesty, who was a mine of compassion, lamented greatly and exclaimed, \u201cWould that his brother Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib Beg had been killed in his stead.\u201d With brotherly feeling, or rather out of general amiability, he, in spite of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s many crimes, became kindly disposed to him and sent him an admi tory firm\u0101n which might be an armlet of dominion and fortune and\n\n---\n\n1 Bay\u0101z\u012bd writes h\u016bral and says the result of the order was that some lost Rs. 2000 and did get one back, and that others who had not ten rupees got 10,000.\n\n2 T\u0101r.

As the Mirz\u0101, being drunk with folly, had turned away from fortune and put dominion behind his back, the sage advices were of no avail. In reply to that roll of grace and preamble of knowledge, he uttered the following verse\u2014\n\nVerse.*\n\nWho'd to his bosom strain dominion's bride\nMust kiss the gleaming falchion's lip.\n\nNa\u1e63\u012bb Ramm\u0101l conveyed to the royal hearing the account of the Mirz\u0101's recalcitrance and an order was given for strengthening the batteries. Meanwhile, Mirz\u0101s Sulaim\u0101n and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm arrived with all their forces and were made partakers of royal favours. C\u0101kar Kh\u0101n, son of Wais Qibc\u0101q also arrived with the men of K\u016bl\u0101b and formed a supplement to the army of fortune. During this period of one month of the siege the gates of victory opened more and more for the imperialists, while the knot of affairs grew tighter for M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, and he became more and more straitened. At last he became hopeless of the success of tricks and stratagems, and also\n\n---\n\n1 These last two lines are not in Jauhar and would be better away.\n2 I.e., a diviner or soothsayer.\n3 Jauhar says that when K\u0101mr\u0101n received Hum\u0101y\u016bn's letter he read it and was silent for a while, and then quoted the verse.\n4 This compleat is said by \u1e24aidar Mirz\u0101 to have been sent by Shaib\u0101n\u012b to Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101'\u012bl.

Involuntarily he pushed his hands to the saddle strips (f\u00eetr\u00e2k)\u00b9 of obedience and submission. By means of this device he saved himself this time from the whirlpool of danger and brought the ship of safety from out the tumult of the waves to the shore of salvation. With this design, he made various supplications and cries for help. One day he fastened a letter to an arrow and shot it into the camp. Its purport was that he had not recognised the claims of his Majesty to reverence. \"I have seen what I have seen, and now I repent of the past and wish that leave may be granted to me to circumambulate the Holy Ka'aba so that I may be cleansed from the sin of rebellion and the anguish of ingratitude, and may become fit for proper service. My hope is that this boon may be granted to me through the intervention of Mir 'Arab\u00b2 of Mecca.\" The Mir was distinguished among all the devotees of the age for honesty and transparency and had applied himself to alchemy. His Majesty Jah\u00e2nb\u00e2ni Jinnatshiy\u00e2ni had a regard for him, and on this expedition he kept close to the royal stirrup and was adorning the army of prayer (laskhar-i-du'a). When the petition of supplication reached the royal hearing, he sent for the Mir and spoke to him about it. The Mir said that he would write an answer and send it into the fort. He wrote as follows.\u00b3\n\n\"Know, O men of the fort, that salvation is in sincerity and safety in submission, and peace be upon whoever followeth the right path.\"\n\nWhen M. K\u00e2mr\u00e1n had understood the purport of this writing, he wrote back by the same method that he would submit to whatever the Mir should order. His Majesty Jah\u00e2nb\u00e2ni, inasmuch as kindness and benevolence were of his nature's essence, sent off the Mir, who proceeded to the fort and expounded the doctrines of verity which in reason's reservoir are more sweet than limpid streams, but more bitter to the sensual taste than the juice of the colocynth.

He stopped, and said to the Mirz\u0101, \"As you have set out to kiss the threshold and have emerged from the circle of sedition, and have escaped from a state of rebellion, the proper thing for auspiciousness and repentance is that you send the runaway officers to the Court with their necks bound, that you yourself recite the khutba in his Majesty's name, and that you secretly depart and go off to the Hij\u0101z.\" The Mirz\u0101 accepted the advice and agreed to everything, but added, \"Entreat his Majesty to suffer B\u0101b\u016bs to depart along with me, for he is an old servant, and I am desirous of atoning to him on this journey for what I have done to him.\" When the Mir returned and reported the circumstances to his Majesty, he asked pardon for the Mirz\u0101's offences, and his Majesty, on account of his constitutional kindness, forgave him and ratified all that the Mir had arranged.\n\nOn Friday, 12th Rajab, 955, 12th August, 1548, Maul\u0101n\u0101 'Abdul Baqi the \u0160adr recited the khutba in his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni's name,\n\n---\n\n1 These words are followed by the clause, \"and this amount of submission is sufficient in the outer world,\" and this is put as if it were part of the Mir's reflections. But I believe it is a parenthesis of A.F.'s own.\n\n2 This and much else is taken from Bay\u0101z\u012bd. It is strange that K\u0101mr\u0101n should have thought it possible for him to stone to B\u0101b\u016bs, but perhaps B\u0101b\u016bs' return to him shewed that he had condoned the outrages. K\u0101mr\u0101n's begging that B\u0101b\u016bs might be allowed to go with him was a sign of grace, for it saved him from the probable fate of the other officers. Niz\u0101m\u016b-d-d\u012bn says distinctly that he begged forgiveness for B\u0101b\u016bs. Bay\u0101z\u012bd says that K\u0101mr\u0101n begged off B\u0101b\u016bs saying he had killed his sons and that by taking him to Mecca he would obtain absolution (bah\u012bl\u012b has\u012bl karam), and that Hum\u0101y\u016bn agreed, saying that he did not want cuckold's (dev\u016bs) in his camp. According to Firishta, Hum\u0101y\u016bn was so elated by his victory that he broken out into poetry in the fata\u1e25n\u0101ms, or proclamation which he sent to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n. Firishta gives the verses and also Bair\u0101m's quatrain in reply.\nand his Majesty went off from there to a garden in hood. The batteries were dismantled, and an order w H\u0101ji Mahommad should be present with a body of M\u012brz\u0101 was departing with a few men, as had been arranged until his exit from the dominions they should guard \u2018Ali Dost Kh\u0101n B\u0101rgb\u0113g\u012b, \u2018Abdal Wahh\u0101b, Sayyid Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Shaikh K\u0101m\u0101n, L\u0101k\u016bf\u012b Sahrind\u012b and others were appointed to guard the gate of the fort and the runaway officers and to let the M\u012brz\u0101 pass with the companions. The M\u012brz\u0101 came out in accordance with th On the way, one of M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s servants recognised as horse which one of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s servants was riding, and to M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, who sent people to bring away the horse this was brought to his Majesty\u2019s ears, he, in his courtesy, disa of the proceeding and censured M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and he, out o and narrowness of disposition went off without leave to K\u0101sh Muhammad, too, was blamed as the insult to the M\u012brz\u0101 has committed with his knowledge. A gracious firm\u0101n con apologies, with a robe of honour and a horse were sent along Khw\u0101ja Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mahm\u016bd the M\u012br Biy\u016bt\u0101t (to K\u0101mr\u0101n). I the night was somewhat advanced, Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n was prod with a sword tied to his neck. When he came in front of the tor an order was issued for removing the sword; his guilt was forg and he was honoured by being allowed to do homage. And Majesty said in T\u00fcrki, \u201cTis the fortune of war, such accidents\n\n1 Apparently the garden of M\u012br Telaq (B\u0101rgb\u0113g\u012b).\n2 Bay\u0101z\u012bd says it was a d\u0101h, or maidservant who was on the horse. This would make the insult the greater. A.F. probably uses the word Khidmatg\u0101r as at I. 44 line 7 to mean a female servant.\n3 Bay\u0101z\u012bd says that when Hum\u0101y\u016bn caught sight of Qar\u0101ca he said, \u201cHe is a white-bearded man, and I called him father, take off the sword from his neck.\u201d\n4 \u2018\u0100lam-i-s\u012bgh\u0101gh\u0101r\u012b ast. Apparently Hum\u0101y\u016bn kindly intended to console Qar\u0101ca for his defeat by presenting that he had only suffered from the mistakes or accidents inseparable from war, and drew a lesson over the treachery of his behaviour. We find in Bay\u0101z\u012bd, Hum\u0101y\u016bn uses a similar expression in the manner of his defeat at Balkh in order to hearten his men. The words there are \u1e24asrat ans\u0101r dild\u0101r\u012bh\u0101 m\u012bdh\u0101 and ke \u2018\u0101lam s\u012bgh\u0101gh\u0101r\u012b ast n\u0101dar\u0101d. \u201cHis Majesty was using various encouragements, saying it is the fortune of war, there is no disgrace.\u201d\nHe was ordered to stand on the left, below\n\nNext they brought Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Beg with a quiver and a sword at\n\nWhen he came near the torches an order was given for\n\nSimilarly they brought Sard\u0101r Beg the\n\nHis Majesty said \u201c\u2019Tis the elders\u2019 fault, what\n\nIn this manner the other officers\n\ncame Qurb\u0101n Qar\u0101wal, a personal servant of his Majesty and\n\nHis Majesty said in\n\n\u201c\u2019Urki, \u201cWhat ailed you, and what made you go away.\u201d He replied\n\nin the same language, \u201cWhat is the use of inquiring about the\n\ncomplexion of those who have been made black by the hand of God\u2019s\n\npower\u201d? Hasan Quli Sultan Muhrd\u0101r, who was always allowed\n\nliberty of speech, recited this verse in the assembly.\n\nVerse.\n\nWhen a lamp has been lighted by God\n\nWho puffs at it burns his own beard.\n\nAll the officers felt uneasy at the appropriateness (of the\n\nquotation) to Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n who had a long beard. Next day his\n\nMajesty marched from there and encamped in a pleasant meadow on\n\nthe bank of the T\u0101liq\u0101n river. On Wednesday, 17th Rajab, M.\n\nK\u0101mr\u0101n came back, under divine guidance, and did homage. The\n\nexplanation of this remarkable occurrence is as follows. In B\u0101d\u0101mdarsh\n\nM. K\u0101mr\u0101n was expatiating to M. \u2018Abdull\u0101h in thanksgiving\n\nfor the royal favours and was expressing his surprise at his Majesty\u2019s\n\n1 Bay\u0101z\u012bd says that on hearing\n\nQarb\u0101n\u2019s reply Hum\u0101y\u016bn smiled and\n\ntold his d\u012bw\u0101ns that if Qarb\u0101n\u2019s j\u0101g\u012br\n\nhad been resumed, it should be\n\nrestored to him.\n\n2 This verse as stated by Vamb\u0113ry,\n\nHist. of Bokh\u0101ra, 256, to have been\n\nquoted by the unfortunate Khw\u0101ja\n\nAb\u016bl Mak\u0101rim (see B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem. 65),\n\nto Sh\u0101h\u012bb\u0101n\u012b in 1501 when questioned\n\nas to why he had shaved off his beard.\n\n3 Probably the better rendering is\n\nthat given by Erskine in a note Hist.\n\nII. 357. \u201cAll the rebel lords, but\n\nespecially Qar\u0101ca, felt much ashamed.\n\n4 Apparently the Bangi river,\n\nwhich is called by Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn the\n\nT\u0101liq\u0101n river.\n\n5 Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn, Lucknow ed. 215,\n\nsays K\u0101mr\u0101n had gone two leagues\n\n(parasangs) when he turned back.\n\nErskine\u2019s copy, see Hist. II. 358, had\n\nten and not two leagues, and this is\n\nin all probability correct.\npassing over so many crimes and acts of disrespect. M. 'Abdullah asked him what he would have done if he had been in his Majesty's place. K\u0101mr\u0101n replied that he would not have forgiven or forgotten. Then, said M. 'Abdullah, you have an opportunity of making atonement, how would it be if you availed yourself of it? The Mirz\u0101 asked what he meant, and M. 'Abdullah said, \"We are this day in a place where the king's arm cannot reach us. The right thing is for us to go post haste with a few men and make our submission, return thanks to his Majesty and beg pardon for our offences, and render acceptable service.\" M. K\u0101mr\u0101n approved of the idea and set off with a few men; when he came nigh the camp he sent B\u0101b\u016bs to do obeisance and to report his coming. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b rejoiced at the coming of the Mirz\u0101 and ordered that first Mun'im Kh\u0101n, Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n, Mir Mu\u1e25ammad Munshi, Hasan Quli Sult\u0101n Muhrdar, B\u0101lt\u016b Beg, Tuw\u0101c\u012b Begi, T\u0101khc\u012b Beg and many others should go forth, and after them that Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sult\u0101n Shaib\u0101n\u012b, Khizr Khw\u0101ja Sult\u0101n, Iskandar Sult\u0101n, 'Ali Quli Kh\u0101n, Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n and many others should go, and thirdly, that M. Hindal, M. 'Askari, and M. Sulaim\u0101n should go to welcome him. And on the same day he ordered that the chains should be taken off M. 'Askari's feet.\n\nNext morning the princes and officers came and paid their respects in accordance with forms which his Majesty had prescribed, and his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b took his seat on the throne and held a general audience. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n hastened forward to kiss the carpet and paid the obeisances of supplication and the prostrations of sincerity. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b graciously observed, \"The ceremonials of reception (didan-i-t\u014dra) have been observed, now come and let us embrace like brothers.\" Then he clasped the Mirz\u0101 to his bosom, and wept so violently that all those present were touched to the heart. The Mirz\u0101 after making profound obeisances sat on the left in accordance with the royal indication. His Majesty said in\n\n1 This is the 'Abdullah Kh\u0101n Moghal of Blochmann, 896. He was K\u0101mr\u0101n's brother-in-law, and Akbar afterwards married his daughter.\n\n2 Jauhar says, \"on the right hand,\" but all the A.N. MSS. have \"left.\" Though Hum\u0101y\u016bn was very generous and forgiving he was also a great stickler for propriety and it was probably to mark K\u0101mr\u0101n's previous misconduct that he was not put on the right hand like Sulaim\u0101n the son of his father's cousin. Erskine, however, Hist. II. 358 seems to imply that the left was among the Turks the place of honour.\nTurki \"Sit close by.\" The right side was pointed out to M. Sulaim\u0101n. In like manner the princes and officers sat on the right and left according to their degree. All the intimate courtiers, such as \u1e24asan Quli Muhrd\u0101r, M\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Munshi, Haidar Mu\u1e25ammad, Maq\u1e63\u016bd Beg Akhta, sat close together (dar dingal). A great festival was held. Q\u0101sim Cang\u012b, Kocak Ghicaki, Makhl\u0101s Qab\u016bzi, \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Sult\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad Rukhna, Khw\u0101ja Kam\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Husain, \u1e24\u0101fi\u1e93 Muhr\u012b and others of this enchanting band took their seats near the festive circle\u00b9 (q\u016br) and discoursed delightful music. Among the younger men (ikkah\u0101) there were K\u0101kar \u2018Ali, Sh\u0101ham Beg Jal\u0101ir, T\u016blak Qo\u010din and others standing behind the circle (q\u016br). Fruits and varied dishes were set out in royal fashion. In this assembly \u1e24asan Quli Muhrd\u0101r said to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, \"I have heard that it was stated before you that some one had said in Pir Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n's presence that whoever did not cherish hatred as big as an orange against Martwza \u2018Ali was not entitled to be called a Musalm\u0101n, and that you remarked thereupon that it behoved a servant of God to have such hatred as big as a pumpkin.\" The M\u012brz\u0101 became very angry and said, \"Then it seems people take me for a heretic\"\u00b2 (kh\u0101riji). There was general conversation (?) and his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni scattered pearls of speech. The meeting lasted till the end of day. In this joyful assembly M. \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b was made over to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, and allowed to go to his quarters. As the M\u012brz\u0101 had come in a hurry, tents, &c., were erected\n\n\u00b9 Bay\u0101z\u012bd says, behind the q\u016br. The word has several meanings, the most common being that of \"flags and other ensigns;\" Blochmann 50 note. But here the word seems to have the meaning given in P. de Courteille's Dict. \"cercle de gens qui sont en f\u00eate.\"\n\n\u00b2 A.F. seems to have taken this story from Bay\u0101z\u012bd, and as usual, he rather spoils it. According to Bay\u0101z\u012bd the remark was first made in the Court of \u2018Ubaidu-l-l\u0101h, and this is the way the story is told in Sh\u0101h Tahm\u0101sp's Memoirs. See Dr. Teufel's paper on the Z.D.M.G. and Dr. Horn's translation, Strasburg, 1892, p. 37. See also the paper on Bay\u0101z\u012bd's Memoirs J.A.S.B., LXVI. Part I, No. 4 for 1898. Dr. Teufel quotes a somewhat similar mode of comparison from Herodotus. K\u0101mr\u0101n had married an Uzbeg wife, and was no doubt desirous when at Balkh of ingratiating himself with the Uzbegs, who were Sunnis like himself. The story therefore is probably true. In reply to K\u0101mr\u0101n's angry denial \u1e24asan excused himself by saying that he was only repeating what he had heard and by using the proverb that the quoting of infidel-expressions does not make one's self an infidel.\nfor him near the royal residence. Next day a counsel was held with the princes and officers about an expedition against Balkh. Everyone spoke according to his opinions. His Majesty ordered that when the army arrived at N\u0101r\u012b whatever appeared proper should be carried into execution. N\u0101r\u012b is a village from which there is a road to Balkh and another to K\u0101bul.\n\nOn the fourth day they marched from this delightful station and at night encamped at the spring of Bandgasha which is near Ishkamish where a joyful assembly was held. To that memorable place his Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs Mak\u0101n\u012b had come in former times, and Kh\u0101n Mirz\u0101 and Jahang\u012br Mirz\u0101 had presented themselves there and placed the head of obedience on the line of command. And his Majesty Fird\u016bs Mak\u0101n\u012b had in commemoration of his having halted there, and of the coming of his brothers and of their making their submission recorded the date on a rock. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jinnat Ashiy\u0101n\u012b who had come to this delightful spot in accordance with H.H. Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b\u2019s precedent also recorded the date of his coming, and of the homage of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, and the assembling together of the brothers. And these two dates of two mighty kings on one stone-tablet are like the writing of the portico of time on the page of night and day, being two closely intertwined memorials.\u00b9 From thence his Majesty proceeded to the village of N\u0101r\u012b\u00b2 and proceeded\n\n\u00b9 The meaning seems to be that the two inscriptions followed one another like day the night. But I think that A.F. has misread his authority (Bay\u0101z\u012bd) and is in error in thinking that B\u0101bar and H\u016bm\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s inscriptions were at one and the same place. Bay\u0101z\u012bd says B\u0101bar engraved his on his return from Samarqand. The inscription then is probably that mentioned in B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs p. 101, but that was put up at a place north of the Oxus, viz., at \u0100bburdan in the Mas\u012bha or Mas\u012bkha hill country and near \u012arat\u012bpa and Far\u011fh\u0101na. Ishkamish or Ishk\u0101mish lies S. of the Oxus and S.E. Qand\u016bz.\n\nIf B\u0101bar was ever there and put up an inscription, it is an event not mentioned in his Memoirs. There is also an Ishkashm in East Badakhsh\u0101n near the ruby mines. According to Gulbadan Begam the meeting of the brothers was at Kishm, but this is east of T\u0101liq\u0101n and out of Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s way. Bandgasha or more properly Bandkasha means a bolt or bar and probably was a name given to the place on account of the reunions that took place there. Bay\u0101z\u012bd tells us that Hum\u0101y\u016bn carved the letters with his own hand.\n\n\u00b2 Though K\u0101mr\u0101n was pardoned at T\u0101liq\u0101n, his retirement to Mecca\nto distribute the territory of Badakhshan. Khatl\u0101n, which is commonly known as K\u016bl\u0101b, was given to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n as far as the (river) M\u016bk and Qar\u0101t\u012bg\u012bn. C\u0101k\u0101r Kh\u0101n was M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s prime minister and was sent along with him. \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b M. was also sent along with the M\u012brz\u0101, and Qar\u0101t\u012bg\u012bn was given to him as his fief. Though M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was not satisfied with his fief yet in consideration of his having been granted his life he did not make any objection. Qila\u2019 Zaffar, T\u0101liq\u0101n and several other parganas were assigned to M\u012brz\u0101s Sulaim\u0101n and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. Qand\u016bz, Gh\u016br\u012b, Kahmard, Baql\u0101n, Ishkamish and N\u0101r\u012b were conferred on M. Hind\u0101l, and Sher \u2018\u0100li was sent along with him. It was arranged that the expedition against Balkh should take place next year. After the princes had thus been\n\nwas apparently still contemplated. So probably he took no part in the discussion at T\u0101liq\u0101n or its vicinity about the expedition to Balkh. As he had been helped by Pir Mu\u1e25ammad the Kh\u0101n of Balkh, (Erskine, Hist. II. 368, thinks this was one reason for the expedition), and had an Uzbeg wife it is hardly natural that he should have been consulted. Jauhar is probably wrong in saying that Hum\u0101y\u016bn contemplated giving Balkh in exchange for or in addition to K\u016bl\u0101b. It was not till after the army got to N\u0101r\u012b (or N\u0101r\u012bn) that the change was made by which K\u0101mr\u0101n gave up his pilgrimage and accepted Khatl\u0101n or K\u016bl\u0101b. At N\u0101r\u012b K\u0101mr\u0101n set off on his expedition to Mecca and had gone half a kos when \u1e24asan Qul\u012b overtook him, and in accordance with Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s instructions induced him to return and to accept K\u016bl\u0101b. Thus then K\u0101mr\u0101n turned twice back, once at T\u0101liq\u0101n and again at N\u0101r\u012bn.\n\n1 For descriptions of Khatl\u0101n and Qar\u0101t\u012bg\u012bn see the Introduction to Erskine\u2019s translation of B\u0101bar\u2019s Memoirs. See also Yule\u2019s Essay,\n\nprefixed to Wood\u2019s Journey, p. lxx. They are both remote places, and mountainous tracts, N. of the Oxus, and no doubt this is why they were given to K\u0101mr\u0101n and \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b. C\u0101k\u0101r Kh\u0101n was the son of Sultan Wais Qip\u00e7\u0101q (Bay\u0101z\u012bd 36a and A.N. I. 278).\n\n2 The M\u016bk or M\u016bks\u016b is a river, Reclus VI. 332. It flows northwards, and falls into the Surkh\u0101b river (which again is a tributary of the Oxus) in the east of Qar\u0101t\u012bg\u012bn. See also Yule\u2019s Essay, prefixed to Wood\u2019s Journey, p. lxx. text and note.\n\n3 According to Jauhar, K\u0101mr\u0101n even after he went to Kab\u0101l expressed a desire to be relieved of his government, and to be allowed to go on pilgrimage. Hum\u0101y\u016bn invited him to Kab\u0101l, but he would not go and quoted a couplet of Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b to the effect that after thirty years he had discovered that sovereignty was beggary (darwesh\u0101t) and beggary sovereignty. But, says Jauhar, he was not sincere in the bottom of his heart.\nmade recipients of royal favours his Majesty decided upon going to K\u0101bul. In a final meeting, agreement and engagements, which are the passwords of those who arrange temporal affairs, were interchanged and everyone having been committed to God, the Disposer of men whether great or small, was permitted to depart, but of brotherly affection he called for a cup of sherbat and after taking a little of it he tendered it to M. Kamr\u0101n, and an order was given that each prince should in his turn partake of the royal draught (\u0101l\u012bgh\u0101, see Vullers s.v.), and pledge themselves to unity and concord. In accordance with the lofty command they together with the bond of brotherhood tied the knot of sincerity and friendship. Each prince received a standard and a kettle drum, and thereby was proclaimed to have obtained the dignity of a confidential relationship. Mirz\u0101s Kamr\u0101n, Sulaim\u0101n and Hind\u0101l were honoured with tamant\u014dgh\u0101\u00b9 and went off from here to their siefs. The royal cort\u00e8ge marched to Kh\u016bst and halted in that delightful spot. His Majesty then went on by Pari\u0101n towards K\u0101bul. Pari\u0101n is a fort of which his Majesty \u0160ahib-qar\u0101n\u012b laid the foundations after he had chastised the Hindus of Kat\u016br.\u00b2 His Majesty repaired it and gave it the name of Isl\u0101m\u0101b\u0101d. When the victorious standards arrived there Pahlw\u0101n Dost Mir Barr was ordered to repair the broken down fort, and the task of supervision was assigned to various officers. His Majesty remained there ten days and by Pahlw\u0101n\u2019s exertions the fort received shape in the course of a week, and was furnished with gates, battlements and embrasures.\u00b3 His Majesty left Beg Mirak in charge of it.\n\nWhen the world-adorning mind was relieved from the business of the fort he turned his attention to the silver mines, but it appeared that the receipts did not equal the working-expenses. From there he proceeded and encamped on the bank of the Panjsh\u012br river near the pass of Ughtar Kar\u0101m.\u2074 He reached the environs of K\u0101bul in the beginning of winter when the ground had become white with snow and waited there for some days in expectation of a suitable time and\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann 50.

His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h in whose coming there were thousands of prosperities and good omens came out to welcome him. The Atgah Kh\u0101n and a number of the courtiers tendered their service. His Majesty exulted and expanded at the auspicious sight of that eye-pupil of the Khil\u0101fat and new moon of glory, from whose temples there shone the auspiciousness of the two worlds, and prostrated his forehead in thanksgiving to Almighty God. On Friday, 2nd Ramz\u0101n, which was the auspicious time, he, attended by victory and conquest, cast the shadow of his advent over the city, and prostrated himself on the floor of prayer. Blessings and congratulations arose from the people, and at this time Samandar came from Kashmir with petitions and presents from M. \u1e24aidar. In the letter were eloquent praises of the climate, of the spring and the autumn, of the flowers and fruits of Kashmir, and pressing entreaties that he would visit that lovely region. There were also fitting expressions about the conquest of Hindustan, and incitements were held to the world-conquering genius. His Majesty out of the abundance of his goodness sent a diploma of victory full of favourable expressions to the M\u012brz\u0101. And he mentioned therein his secret designs upon India. He was constantly engaged in plans for strengthening the Khil\u0101fat and for improving the affairs of the State, and applied his intellect to this object in accordance with the methods which the times called for. Among them was his dismissing to the Hij\u0101z Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n and Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Beg who were ringleaders in hypocrisy, and deserving of all kinds of punishment. His idea was that perchance in times of exile, which is a file of the immoderate in spirit, they might think of the time of fortune, and recognising its blessings to some measure might refrain from following evil. They went off and stayed in the Haz\u0101ra country, and at length the clemency of his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b accepted the inaudible excuses of those ingrates.\n\n1 Apparently Samandar was Hum\u0101y\u016bn's servant and presumably had been sent by him to Kashmir. See former mentions of him in A.N. 173 and 179, where also he is spoken of as an ambassador. There is nothing about him in the T\u0101r. Rash. Perhaps he was sent at the time when Maqd\u016bm Beg was exiled to Kashmir in 952. A.F. has already mentioned that Haidar read the khutba in Hum\u0101y\u016bn's name when K\u0101bul was conquered. Qu. was this in 952 or 954?\n\n2 Namasam\u016b' unheard, meaning I suppose, that they were too far off to be heard, perhaps=unspoken.\nAt the same time he sent Khw\u0101ja Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mahm\u016bd on an embassy to Persia along with gifts and rarities in order that the foundations of affection might be renewed, and love be confirmed.\n\nAmong the occurrences of this year was the martyrdom of M. Ulugh Beg, the son of Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n. The brief account of this affair is that the Mirz\u0101 was proceeding from Zamin D\u0101war, which was his fief, towards Badakhsh\u0101n in order to pay his respects to his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, Khw\u0101ja M\u2019uazzam also accompanied him from a desire to kiss the threshold, and to atone for his offences. When they came near Ghazn\u012bn the news of the grand army\u2019s victory arrived and Khw\u0101ja M\u2019uazzam prevailed upon the Mirz\u0101 to go against the Haz\u0101ras so that they might attack and harry a tribe who were always practising plunder and robbery. From the inconsiderateness which is the natural stock of youthful arrogance and is the madness of pride they did not observe proper strategy and showed rashness in fight. The Mirz\u0101 drank the last draught from the goblet of the scimetar, and his Majesty exalted Tardi Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n by assigning Zamin D\u0101war to him as his fief and sent him off in order that he might bring that country into order. In the same year the ambassadors of \u2018Abdu-r-rashid Kh\u0101n, son of Sult\u0101n S\u0101id Kh\u0101n, the ruler of K\u0101shghar arrived bringing valuable presents. They were welcomed with favours and allowed to return quickly. At the same time \u2018Abb\u0101s Sult\u0101n, one of the Uzbeg princes, gained auspiciousness by kissing the threshold, and was received with favour. His rank was exalted by his marriage with the chaste Gulcihara Begam, a younger sister of his Majesty.\n\nAmong the occurrences of this year was the martyrdom of M. Sh\u0101h, brother of M. Ulugh Beg. He was coming from Ushtar Kar\u0101m, which was in his fief, with the intention of paying his respects, but when he reached the pass of Min\u0101r, Sh\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad, brother of \u1e24\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad, in revenge for M. Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n\u2019s having killed K\u014dk\u012b, the paternal uncle of \u1e24\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad in India, lay in ambush and shot him with an arrow at the top of the pass, and raised the Mirz\u0101 on that summit to the glorious degree of a martyr.\n\n---\n\n1 She was Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s half-sister, being an elder sister of Gulbadan Begam. This was her second marriage.\n\n\u2018Abb\u0101s soon ran away, see next chapter. The lady was no longer young, being probably over thirty.\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nMARCH OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100NI JANNA\u1e6c-\u0100S\u1e24\u012aY\u0100NI FROM K\u0100BUL TO BALKH, AND HIS RETURN OWING TO THE DISCORDANCE OF M. K\u0100MR\u0100N AND THE HYPOCRISY OF THE OFFICERS.\n\nThough the conquest of India and the removal of weeds from that garden held a foremost place in his Majesty\u2019s mind, and though he was also anxious to visit Kashmir, he postponed these enterprises and undertook\u00b9 the expedition to Balkh, which had been previously determined on, and for which preparations had been made.\n\nIn the beginning of 956\u00b2 (February, 1549), when the season had become milder, he sent B\u0101lt\u016b Beg, one of his confidants, to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n with the information that he was proceeding against Balkh in accordance with agreements, and that M. K\u0101mr\u0101n should co-operate in this and meet him when he should arrive at the borders of Badakhsh\u0101n. Orders were also sent to M\u012brz\u0101s Hind\u0101l, \u2018A\u1e63k\u0101r\u012b, Sulaim\u0101n and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm to make arrangements for carriage and to prepare their men and join quickly.\n\nThe grand expedition started, but because of arrangements and the disposal of business and the coming of \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n from Ghazn\u012bn, there was a delay of nearly a month in C\u0101l\u0101k.\u00b3 From this stage Khw. D\u014dst Khaw\u0101nd was sent to K\u016bl\u0101b to bring in M. K\u0101mr\u0101n.\n\nKhw. Q\u0101sim Buy\u016bt\u0101t, a former vizier, Khw. M. Beg, who was d\u012bv\u0101n-i-h\u0101l,\u2074 but owing to whose want of guiding-power (b\u012b ras\u1e25idi)\n\n\u00b9 According to Fir\u016bz\u0101t, Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n had an old quarrel with the Uzbaks and so urged on the expedition against Balkh.\n\u00b2 956 H. began on January 30th. Bay\u0101s\u012bd says that Humay\u016bn started in the beginning of spring; perhaps A.F. was reckoning by the Persian year.\n\u00b3 It is only about two miles north-west of K\u0101bul. (B\u0101bar, 138).\n\u2074 I have not found this title, if title it be. Perhaps it implies that M. Beg was the existing vizier or\nKhw. Gh\u0101z\u012b had seized the charge of affairs\u2014and Khw. Maq\u1e63\u016bd \u2018Al\u012b who was M. K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s factotum, made with others an inquiry, through the instrumentality of M\u012br Barka, into the affairs of Khw. Gh\u0101z\u012b and R\u016bh. All\u0101h. Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n, Muhammad Quli Kh\u0101n Barl\u0101s, Far\u012bd\u016bn Kh\u0101n and Maul\u0101n\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-b\u0101q\u012b, the \u1e63adr, were appointed to audit the accounts. Husain Quli Sult\u0101n\u00b9 who was one of his Majesty\u2019s intimates, was the superintendent in this affair. The result of the inquiry was that Khw. Gh\u0101z\u012b and R\u016bh All\u0101h and a number of other condemned\u00b2 clerks were held to ransom. Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Sult\u0101n was appointed to take an account of Khw. Gh\u0101z\u012b\u2019s property, and Khw. Sult\u0101n \u2018Al\u012b, who, by the favour of his Majesty,\u00b3 had received the title of Afzal (most excellent) Kh\u0101n, was raised from the position of mushrif-i-buy\u016btat to that of d\u012bw\u0101n-i-buy\u016btat.\n\nAt this time, M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm came post and did homage and was welcomed with favours.\n\nWhen his Majesty\u2019s mind had been set at rest about the necessary arrangements for the expedition, he marched to Ist\u0101lif. Here \u2018Abb\u0101s Sult\u0101n\u2074 Uzbak absconded. His Majesty marched slowly, as he waited to be joined by the Mirz\u0101s. When he heard that they had started, and that M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was getting ready, he went by Panjsh\u012br and encamped at Andar\u0101b. In imitation of his Majesty \u0160\u0101h\u012bb-qir\u0101n\u012b, he halted for three days at a stage\u2075 where that fortunate prince had laid foundations. Thence he went to N\u0101r\u012b, where there is a meeting of the ways. Having crossed the N\u0101r\u012b Pass, he traversed the plain of Nilbar,\u2076 the spring beauty of which is famous and pre-eminent above that of other parts of Badakhsh\u0101n. Near this flowery spot, Mirz\u0101s Hind\u0101l and Sulaim\u0101n did homage and were encompassed with favours. Here at M. Sulaim\u0101n\u2019s request, M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm was permitted\n\n\u00b9 Sister\u2019s son of Bair\u0101m and known by the title of Kh\u0101njah\u0101n. Blochmann, 329).\n\u00b2 Malagallibr\u0101 g\u012br\u0101ndand.

His Majesty paid no heed\\(^7\\) to this story, and held firmly to his resolution of going to Balkh.\n\nNext day the advance force arrived at Aibak. Pir Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, the ruler of Balkh, had sent his guardian, Khw. B\u0101gh\\(^8\\) and a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently here used to denote K\u0101gh\u0101n, the capital.

He was a son of J\u0101n\u012b Beg (Vamb\u00e9ry's Bokhara, 282n.) and seems to have died in 955 H. See Sh\u0101hid S\u0101diq 285b.\n\n\\(^5\\) The text omits the conjunction between these names but a variant gives it and it occurs in B\u0101yaz\u012bd, and the Had\u012bqatu-l-aq\u0101l\u012bm gives the names as those of two towns. Vamb\u00e9ry (l.c. Introd. XXIX n.) speaks of Tchichektu and Almar (modern Maimana). Maimana lies about halfway between Balkh and Her\u0101t. The Jajaktu of the text seems properly to be Chichaktu and is so spelt in the map appended to Captain Yate's \"England and Russia face to face. (1887).\" It lies west-south-west of Maimana.\n\n\\(^6\\) B\u0101yaz\u012bd says that Hum\u0101y\u016bn remarked that the Uzbeks were his enemies and that what was a bad sign for them was a good one for himself.\n\n\\(^7\\) Text, M\u0101q; but B\u0101yaz\u012bd, whom probably A.F. is copying, has B\u0101gh M\u0101q may however be right for it\nnumber of experienced men such as Il M., \u1e24ussain Sa\u02bfid Bai; Muhammad Quli M. and J\u016bjak M. to guard Aibak and provide for its defence. They reached it at about the same time as the imperial army and had no resource but to enter the fort of Aibak and secure themselves there. His Majesty arrived and set himself to take the fort and distributed the batteries. In two or three days the garrison asked for quarter and came out and did homage and Aibak fell into the hands of the imperial servants.\n\nHis Majesty held a royal festival and consulted with the at\u0101liq about the conquest of Transoxiana. The at\u0101liq represented that he was not a fit person to consult about such matters, but his Majesty replied that he bore marks of honesty, and that he should, without hesitation, say what he thought. Then the at\u0101liq said that as the serviceable men of Pir Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n had fallen into his Majesty\u2019s hands, he should put them all to death and go on in the career of victory, for Transoxiana would fall into his hands without a battle. His Majesty replied that it is ignoble to break one\u2019s word and that this is especially so in the case of princes; that he had granted quarter and could not recede from this. The at\u0101liq replied that if his Majesty did not approve of this plan, he might keep him prisoner and make a treaty to the effect that all the country on this side of Khulm should be his own and that an auxiliary force should be supplied (i.e., by Pir Mu\u1e25ammad) whenever the expedition against India should take place. As the eternal will and stablished decree had gone forth against these two propositions, what was written by the pen of fate appeared to the Lord of Purpose to be preferable.\u00b2\n\nHis Majesty stayed there several days. Though the climate of Aibak and its abundance of fruit were a motive for staying, yet the chief reason was the non-arrival of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n. The wise and far-seeing used to insist that if this delay had not taken place, Pir Mu\u1e25ammad\n\n\u00b9 See Wood\u2019s Journey, 224, where he says that Bai has the same significance as Kh\u0101n amongst the Afgh\u0101ns.\n\n\u00b2 A good instance of A.F.\u2019s turgid style. Instead of simply stating that Hum\u0101y\u016bn rejected the apparently sound proposition of the at\u0101liq, he says that as another course had been decreed by fate, Hum\u0101y\u016bn also preferred it.\nKh\u0101n would not have been able to resist, and would either have been put to the rout or obliged to make peace on such terms as his Majesty chose. For 'Abdu-l-'az\u012bz Kh\u0101n\u00b9 and the other Uzbek Kh\u0101ns would not have been able to come to help. Since there was long delay, they had time to come to the assistance of the enemy. The Uzbek officers who had been taken prisoners, were sent to K\u0101bul with Khw. Q\u0101sim makhlas, one of the trusted of the Court, but his Majesty took the at\u0101l\u012bq with him and marched by way of Khulm. Two or three days later, they passed Khulm and halted at B\u0101b\u0101 Sh\u0101h\u016b. Next day they encamped near the shrine\u00b2 which is a well-known landmark, and scouts brought information that a large body of Uzbeks had arrived under the leadership of Waqq\u0101s Sult\u0101n and Sh\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n \u1e24is\u0101r\u012b.\u00b3\n\nHis Majesty drew up his troops and set his foot in the stirrup of victory. A slight engagement took place between the advance guards and, at the time of encamping, Sh\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n \u1e24is\u0101r\u012b attacked the camp with a large force. Brave men like Kabuli Kh\u0101n,\u2074 brother of Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim mauji, Sher Mu\u1e25ammad Pakna and Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Turkm\u0101n distinguished themselves. Kabuli fell and the enemy being unable to resist took to flight. \u016akin Ughl\u0101n, a man of distinction among the Uzbeks, was made prisoner and brought to the presence. A dispute arose between Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Turkm\u0101n and Saiyid Mu\u1e25ammad Pakna, each claiming the honour of this feat. His Majesty asked \u016akin who had brought him down. He pointed to Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and said, \"He first aimed a blow at me and the wind of it unhorsed me. When I recovered myself and stood up, this other man,\" pointing to Saiyid Mu\u1e25ammad\n\n\u00b9 As stated in text, he was a son of Ubaidu-l-l\u0101h, the brother-in-law of Haidar M. He began to reign in Bukh\u0101ra in 1540.\n\n\u00b2 The Maz\u0101r-i-sharif of the maps. It is the shrine of Sh\u0101h Auliya, i.e., 'All, Mu\u1e25ammad's son-in-law, his tomb having been discovered there, it is said, during the reign of Sult\u0101n \u1e24usain Baiqr\u0101. There is an account of its discovery in the Hadigatu-l-ag\u0101lim s.v. Balkh. Cf. too Wood's Journey, 135.\n\n\u00b3 Perhaps another son of J\u0101n\u012b Beg and brother of Pir Mu\u1e25ammad. B\u0101yaz\u012bd calls him a son of Barand\u0101q Sult\u0101n. The T\u0101r. R\u0101zh. (161 and 452) also mentions a Sh\u0101h M. Sult\u0101n who was a grandson of Sult\u0101n Ma\u1e25mud Kh\u0101n.\n\n\u2074 B\u0101yaz\u012bd tells us he was killed and his head cut off and taken to Balkh.\nPakna, \"struck me on the face with his sword.\" His Majesty blamed Saiyid Mu\u1e25ammad saying, \"He was thrown down by Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n; you were ungenerous to strike another's catch (said).\" He gave the prize of valour to Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and made over \u00dckin to Pir Mu\u1e25ammad akhta to be cared for.\n\nIn spite of the signs of victory, hypocritical, disloyal officers continued to show faint-heartedness and were continually uttering false reports about M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and spreading them among themselves. Though everything disgraceful which they ascribed to the Mirz\u0101 had the appearance of truth, for he was capable of it and of more, yet in this instance, they fastened false charges on him.\n\nIn fine the Uzbeks gave battle next day in great force and tried to gain the victory, \u2018Abdu-l-\u2018az\u012bz Kh\u0101n, son of Ubaid Kh\u0101n, being in the centre, Pir Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n on the right and Sul\u1e6d\u0101n-i-hi\u1e63\u0101r on the left. His Majesty also drew up his army, he himself occupying the centre, M. Sulaim\u0101n the right wing and M. Hind\u0101l the left, while Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n, Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n and Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Husain Beg Jal\u0101\u012br with his brothers were in the van. After mid-day the armies encountered one another and a great battle raged till evening. Brave men trod the field of courage and drove off the enemy's front ranks across the canals and into the outer defences (k\u016bcaband) of Balkh. His Majesty in the strength of his mental vigour and wisdom, wished to pursue and to take his standards across the canals. His hypocritical followers while pretending to agree, gave wrong advice, and ignorant friends supported their opinion out of ignorance, and thereby made the opinion of enemies to prevail. They did not permit the crossing of the canals and uttered timorous speeches, sometimes alleging the paucity of their men and the number of the enemy; sometimes speaking of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n's going to K\u0101bul and of their fears lest the soldiers' families should be made prisoners, and sometimes urging that they ought to wait for M. K\u0101mr\u0101n. Pressing these and other matters, they recommended a retreat. At length, after a thousand struggles with his spirit, it was agreed to proceed to Daragaz which is a strong position, and to stay there some days and collect the Aimaqs and other soldiers and so to get together the materials of victory. During that delay accurate news of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n would arrive. In the event of his having marched against K\u0101bul, it was not proper for\nthem to torment themselves (k\u0101fl\u016bn) in these parts. At a future time, they could with whole heart, conquer Balkh, nay, Transoxiana and, by the help of God, they had been constantly successful up to this day and would continue so. For every reason it was right to withdraw and proceed to Dara-gaz. His Majesty seeing the general feeling, was helpless and ordered a march in that direction.\n\nThus the already captured Balkh was let go on account of the discord of the disloyal. Shaikh Bahl\u016bl was sent to turn back the van which had crossed the stream and driven back the Uzbeks and entered the fortifications (shahrband). M. Sulaim\u0101n and a number of other valiant men were appointed to be the rear-guard.\n\nAs the whole aim of the disaffected and black-hearted was to confound the army, this compulsory retreat to Dara-gaz, which happened also to be on the route to K\u0101bul, was represented as a return thither, and the march of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was on every-one\u2019s tongue. Men lost heart and separated in different directions. Though his Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b sent \u1e24usain Quli Sl. muhrdar who was one of his confidants, and a number of others also, to turn back the disheartened crowd, it was of no avail, as proposition and disposition did not coincide (taqdir m\u0101fiq-i-tadbir nab\u016bd). And in fact the decree of the Omnipotent was to this effect in order that the vast country of India might be sheltered from the mischief of tyrants and the inflictions of oppressors and become the descension-point of the blessings of a holy personality, and the abiding-throne and theatre (takhtg\u0101h-i-abd dastg\u0101h) of his Majesty, the Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h, the Shadow of God; and that many thousands of good seeds might be shed over the wide fields of earth and the hope-plots of the sincere. To sum up; God, the World-adorner, revealed such a victory as this under the guise of conditions which might prove a lesson and a warning to the wise, and thereby brought to pass the things of counsel and wisdom. For had this disaster not occurred, the work of the helpless ones of India would have been hindered by the undertaking of the conquest of Transoxiana; and the setting-in order of those lands which are a haven for the pilgrims of the seven climes, had sunk under the veil of delay.\n\n1 Kaftan means to split or cleave and the sense seems to be that now their minds were divided; afterwards they could in comfort ba \u1e21atir-i-jama\u2019, lit. with united heart, conquer Balkh, etc.\nIn brief, when the enemy became aware of the unpleasing occurrence (i.e., the retreat), they put their own confused affairs in order and came in pursuit. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b displayed splendid courage and performed achievements whose eulogy might be the frontispiece to the model-battles of the world. In that jungle of tigers of war, his world-traversing dun-coloured\\(^1\\) steed which bore the name of tasarru-n-naqirin\\(^2\\) and had been presented to him by Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n,\\(^3\\) the governor of Her\u0101t and which he was riding, fell from being wounded by an arrow. Haidar Mu\u1e25ammad akhta presented that leader of faith and dominion with his own horse and was exalted by this piece of service. As the Divine protection was hovering over that Lord of Sovereignty\u2019s throne, he was brought into a place of safety. Most of his followers, when they beheld symptoms of defeat, dispersed in all directions in a cowardly and ignominious manner.\n\nThe names of the chief officers of the army are as follows: Mir\u0101s Hind\u0101l and Sulaim\u0101n, Qara\u010da Kh\u0101n, \u1e24\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n, Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n, Khi\u1e63r Khw. Sl.,\\(^4\\) Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Kh\u0101n Jal\u0101\u2018\u012br, Iskandar Kh\u0101n, Q\u0101sim Husain Kh\u0101n, Haidar Mu\u1e25ammad akhta-beg\u012b, \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h Kh\u0101n Uzbek, \u1e24usain Quli Kh\u0101n muhrdar, Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Zarr\u012bn f\u0101m, golden-coloured. B\u0101yaz\u012bd calls the horse, asp-i-qula, dun-coloured.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tasarru-n-naqirin. It delights beholders. This is an Arabic expression and is used in the Kor\u0101n to describe the kind of cow which Moses told the Israelites to sacrifice. The reading of the text is probably correct, but it differs from the word in B\u0101yaz\u012bd, in the copy in the India Office though it would seem that it is from B\u0101yaz\u012bd that A.F. has taken the story. There the word looks like nazzar, but Erskine in his MS. translation has nastar so perhaps he took the word to be nastar, or nasr\u012bn, i.e., the narcissus. This might be an allusion to the yellow colour of the horse.\n\nB\u0101yaz\u012bd who was evidently fond of horses and proud of his powers of managing them, as a later story of his shows, is careful to tell us that Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s horse afterwards died of its wound. He adds that the horse given by Haidar to Hum\u0101y\u016bn was t\u0101raq\u012b, bow-legged, or weak-kneed.\n\n\\(^3\\) Most MSS. seem to have Sharafudd\u012bn after Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n.\n\n\\(^4\\) Gulbadan Begam\u2019s affection induces her to represent her husband as behaving in heroic fashion during the retreat, by turning back to search for Hind\u0101l. But B\u0101yaz\u012bd names him as one of those who refused to stand when called upon to do so by \u1e24usain Quli and he says it was Sh\u0101h Quli N\u0101ranj\u012b who went back to look for Hind\u0101l. A.F. seems to include in his list both the leaders who behaved well and those who ran away.\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\n(son of) Mir Khalifa, Sl. Husain Khan, Baltu Sl., Musahib Beg, Shah Bidagh Khan, Shahan Khan Beg Jalair, Shah Quli Naranji, Muhammad Qasim mauji, Laqafu-l-lah of Sihirind, 'Abdu-l-wahhab Auji, Baqi Muhammad parwanci, and Khaldin.\n\nThree days later, his Majesty halted at the top of the pass of the Four Springs and here Muhammad Quli Shaikh Turkman who had hit on the right road, heard of the royal party and joined it.\n\nFrom this place, his Majesty wrote an affectionate epistle to his Majesty the Shahinshah, and to the chaste ladies who were in Kabul, the abode of peace and sent it by Beg Muhammad akhta-begi. He also sent a friendly letter to Rashid Khan, the ruler of Kashghar who had always shown loyalty and devotion, informing him of his arrival and telling him how his evil-minded brother, M. Kamran, had by constraint of his natural character, elevated the hideousness of discord over the beauty of concord and so had completely depressed the side of love and loyalty. Many of his followers too had shewn a want of\n\n1 Perhaps this epithet means that he was a native of Aujan in Azarbaijan. (Jarrett III. 81 and Ouseley's Travels). But most MSS. have Audaji, e.g., B.M. 27, 247 and 5610.\n\n2 Probably the Khaldin Dost Sahari mentioned in text (316) in the list of Hindal's servants.\n\n3 Text, bar sar-i-yak, on the top of the ice, but reference to Bayazid and to various MSS. of the A.N. has convinced me that the proper reading is bar sar-i-paj, top of the pass or mountain. Bayazid has bar sar-i-kutal and kutal has the meanings of paj. It is true that he also has the expression in the same passage \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064e, a convolution or winding road, and that possibly this may refer to the winding road taken by Humayun as distinguished from the rak-i-rast, straight road, taken by Kamran. (According to Steingass, the phrase rak-rast means \"a great distance.\")\n\nIt seems to me that in several parts of this narrative, A.F. and Bayazid have copied from the same source.\n\nCahar Caghma is marked in the Government map of Afghanistan as S.W. of Haibak and near Dara-yusaf. Bayazid speaks of four wells,\u2014two, apparently at the top of the pass, and two lower down. He describes then as near Aibak.\n\n4 Text, kamal. Several MSS. have Kamal but Bayazid seems to have Turkman, and evidently the man meant as the M. Quli Turkman Afghan of Blochmann 474. See Bayazid 47b, 48a and 75a. MSS. have kamal. The expression in text is not clear. Bayazid says the Shaikh was going along on the right or straight road. M. Quli brought the welcome news that the Uzbeks had discontinued the pursuit.\ncourage. Certainly the expedition had not redounded to the joy of well-wishers; on the contrary, it had been a cause of sorrow and distress. In the same letter, he expressed his thanks for his safety and he inserted excellent counsels such as might comfort a loving heart.\n\nLeaving that place, he arrived after one night's interval, at Gh\u00fbrband and on the next night, at Khw\u00e2ja Siy\u00e2r\u00e2n. Thence he went to Qar\u00e2 Bagh and thence to Ma'm\u00fbra. His Majesty, the Sh\u00e2hansh\u00e2h, came out to meet him here and was affectionately received. From this place he went in an auspicious hour to K\u00e2bul.\n\nM. Sulaim\u00e2n went off to Badakhsh\u00e2n and M. Hind\u00e2l to Qund\u00fbz, Mun'im Kh\u00e2n accompanying him. All the other officers followed his Majesty to K\u00e2bul. Sh\u00e2h Bid\u00e2gh Kh\u00e2n who had given proofs of courage, remained a prisoner with the enemy, as did also Mir Shar\u00eef bakhsh\u00ee, Khw. N\u00e2q\u00eeru-d-d\u00een 'Ali mustauft\u00ee, Mir Mu\u1e25ammad munsh\u00ee, Mir J\u00e2n Beg d\u00e2rogha-i-'imarat, and Khw. Mu\u1e25ammad Amin Kang. All the other servants were safe.\n\nWhen the at\u00e2liq and other Uzbeks who had been made prisoners at Aibak, were released and went to their own country, and gave account of the royal kindness and liberality, Pir Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e2n was astonished, and sent his prisoners in a humane manner to K\u00e2bul.\n\nHis Majesty, recognizing that his return was really advantageous, set himself to arrange his kingdom and engaged in the conduct of things spiritual and temporal. Khw. Jal\u00e2lu-d-d\u00een Ma\u1e25m\u00fbd had been sent on an embassy to the king of Persia, but from various causes had delayed in Qandah\u00e2r and he was now recalled. Khw. 'Abd\u00fb-s-qamad and Mir Saiy\u00eed 'Ali who were celebrated for their skill in painting, came with the Khw\u00e2ja and were graciously received. Khw. Sl. 'Ali, known as Afzal Kh\u00e2n, was raised from the position of maghrib-i-khiz\u00e2na to that of vizier; while the whole charge of the div\u00e2ni was made over to Khw. M. Beg.\n\nThe account of M. K\u00e2mr\u00e2n is as follows. When his Majesty, out of his kindness and affection, forgave his grave offences and gave him K\u00fbl\u00e2b and appointed C\u00e2kar Beg of K\u00fbl\u00e2b, the son of Sl. Wais\n\n---\n\n1 Dih-i-ma'm\u00fbra, near K\u00e2bul. (Jarrett II. 404).\n2 It is not clear whether this is the promotion recorded above (text 286) or a still higher one.\nBeg, as his co-adjutor and went to K\u0101bul, no long time intervened before the Mirz\u0101 behaved badly to C\u0101kar Beg and drove him out: He placed the great favours which had been bestowed on him in the niche (\u1e6d\u0101q) of forgetfulness and giving way to evil thoughts, watched for his opportunity. During the time that His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was in K\u0101bul, he was continually making false promises that he would come; and His Majesty, out of his candid nature and straightforwardness,\u2014which are the characteristics of magnanimous natures,\u2014believed his false words and went off to Balkh. The Mirz\u0101 looked upon this opportunity as fair gain and again determined in his perfidious heart, that he would go to K\u0101bul. The rebellious designs which were leavening his mind, came near the surface, and at his instigation, narrow-minded and disloyal officers practised various hypocrisies in that expedition, as has already been related. But as His Majesty returned and cast the shade of his justice on K\u0101bul, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n left M. \u2018Askari in K\u016bl\u0101b and went off to fight M. Sulaim\u0101n. The latter hastened away without fighting from T\u0101liq\u0101n to Qil\u2019a Zafar.\n\nM. K\u0101mr\u0101n made over T\u0101liq\u0101n to B\u0101b\u016bs Beg and proceeded towards Qil\u2019a Zafar. Mirz\u0101s Sulaim\u0101n and Ibr\u0101him not thinking it expedient to fight left Ishaq Sultan in Qil\u2019a Zafar and went off to the defiles of Badakhsh\u0101n. They took post in the village of Jirm and awaited the Divine retribution. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, having disposed of M. Sulaim\u0101n went off to Qund\u016bz. He began by making false pretences to M. Hind\u0101l and proposed a union with him. M. Hind\u0101l did not hearken to him and stood by his obligations, whereupon M. K\u0101mr\u0101n laid siege to Qund\u016bz. M. Hind\u0101l neglected no point in defending the fort and when M. K\u0101mr\u0101n could not succeed, he joined the Uzbeks and asked their assistance. A large body of Uzbeks came to help him and joined him in the siege. M. Hind\u0101l in order to cause confusion and deceive the foe, which in fact is a guidance on the high road of success, devised an excellent plan, viz., he wrote a letter as from M. Kamr\u0101n to himself, full of a renewal of peace between them and of deceiving the Uzbeks, and after the manner of experts, he gave this false document to a courier who was intentionally to throw himself into the hands of Uzbeks. When, on searching the courier, the letter was found, and when it appeared\n\n---\n\n1 A brother-in-law of K\u0101mr\u0101n.\nfrom its contents that the two Mirz\u0101s were going to act in concert and make the Uzbeks a target for the arrows of evil, the latter were confounded and withdrew from the siege and set off for their own country. The affair of the fort remained unaccomplished and just then, news came that C\u0101kar Beg was besieging K\u016bl\u0101b and that M. \u2018Askari had been defeated and was shut up therein. Also that M. Sulaim\u0101n had joined with Ish\u0101q Sl. and had got possession of Qil\u2019a Zafar and had then imprisoned Ish\u0101q Sl. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was bewildered at this news and withdrawing in despair from Qund\u016bz, he sent Y\u0101sin Daulat and B\u0101b\u016bs with a body of troops against M. Sulaim\u0101n and himself hastened to K\u016bl\u0101b and made C\u0101kar Beg retire. M. \u2018Askari came out and did homage to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n who took him with himself, and went off to put down M. Sulaim\u0101n. They had halted near R\u016bst\u0101q, when a large force of Uzbeks who had come on a plundering expedition (yurt\u0101w\u0101l\u012b)\u00b9 under the leadership of Sa\u2019id Beg, passed by the encampment and made a raid on it. Mirz\u0101s K\u0101mr\u0101n, \u2018Askari and \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h Mughal escaped with a few men to T\u0101liq\u0101n. When the Sa\u2019id afore-named knew the rights of the matter, he sent back the baggage\u00b2 to the Mirz\u0101 with all respect and apologized for the plundering. Mirz\u0101s Hind\u0101l and Sulaim\u0101n thinking the opportunity favourable, set out to put down M. K\u0101mr\u0101n who not deeming it advisable to remain in Badakhsh\u0101n, went off to Khost in order that he might, by the route of Zuhh\u0101q and B\u0101mi\u0101n withdraw into the Haz\u0101ra country. There he would learn the real state of K\u0101bul and either proceed there or go elsewhere.\u00b3 As the disloyal officers of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b were always urging the Mirz\u0101 to come to K\u0101bul, he fraudulently sent ambassadors to the Court and represented that his object in coming was to apologize for the past and to serve his\n\n\u00b9 P. de C. gives in his Dictionary, \u0639\u0631\u0628\u06cc as meaning \u201ctroupe qu\u2019on envoie pour faire une razzie, coureurs.\u201d\n\n\u00b2 See errata to text. The word is really \u0639\u0631\u0628\u06cc aghir\u012bq. It probably included K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s wives and daughters for Gulbedan says they were captured. B\u0101yaz\u012bd says it was Pir Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n of Balkh who sent back the plunder. It would appear from Gulbedan, that he was the son of a brother of one of K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s wives.\n\n\u00b3 B\u0101yaz\u012bd says K\u0101mr\u0101n\u2019s idea was to go to Bhakkar and it is very likely\u2014(having regard to his relations with the ruling family of Bhakkar), that d\u012bgar of the text is a mistake for Bhakkar.\nMajesty. His hope was, he said, that His Majesty would with royal kindness, forgive his crimes and sins.\n\nVerse.\n\nI've come again to worship the dust of thy feet,\nIf submission be ordered, I'm ready to pay it.\n\n\"My hope is that on this occasion, I may by good service, obtain release from the heavy burden of shame.\" His Majesty from the purity of his own nature, regarded his gold-incrusted copper as genuine, and accepted it according to the standard for fine gold.\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nMarch of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b from K\u0101bul, and Fight with M. K\u0101mr\u0101n; and other instructive occurrences.\n\nWhen the arrival of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n at the borders of K\u0101bul was approaching, a number of the loyal and farseeing represented that there should be a limit to simplicity and optimistic views of persons. Seeing that the fraud, lying and disaffection of this ingrate had been tested many times, it was right and proper that caution should not be thrown away again, and that the army should be ordered to march out, and the banners of victory be unfurled for the suppression of the rebellious. If indeed the M\u012brz\u0101 had repented of his evil deeds, and had entered on the path of concord, and were desirous of doing homage, he would receive distinction from the royal favour (in going out to welcome him), and if on this occasion also he was persistent in perversity, the rules of precaution would be observed on our side. On hearing these weighty words His Majesty determined to march towards Gh\u016brband, which was the M\u012brz\u0101's route, and he set out in that direction in the middle of 957 (June-July, 1550). He left His Majesty the Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h as prince in K\u0101bul and put Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n Berl\u0101s at the head of affairs. Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n, Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Beg and many others, white without and black within, who were always stirring up strife, were rejoiced and wrote seditious letters to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, pressing him to come to K\u0101bul and saying that they, and many others, would welcome him and would disperse the King's well-wishers by unfitting suggestions, and that K\u0101bul would easily fall into his hands.\n\n'Tis marvellous how actions which, with complete inconsistency, they regarded as improper when practised on themselves by equals and associates, viz., promise-breaking, evil-devising, and lying, should all be performed by them against their Master and benefactor! Their blinded eyes opened not to the hideousness thereof, nay, they regarded its repulsiveness as a beauty, and counted it as part of their\nwisdom of strategy. Though they understood loyalty and right dealing and looked for them in their servants, yet they were so overcome by their own baseness as to play the game of deceit and infidelity against such a pure-hearted Master! And what wrongheadedness also! I can imagine that they could not comprehend the glorious merits of this holy personality, but where was their common sense! That which they expected from their own servants they would not render to that aggregation of benevolences and to that bestower of so many favours, any one of which deserved a life's devotion, but on the contrary they acted in the very opposite way to one who was their Master and benefactor, and requited him with negligence and wrong advice. But alas! What marvel is it that he who has been kneaded of strife and malice, should show such behaviour? What joy have the born-blind in the glory of the sun? The sincerity's eye of this crew has been filmed over with hypocrisy and become void of light, and their breast of love has been narrowed by the tumour of pride! How can such recognise a Master's rights to gratitude, or perceive the beauties of a benefactor? What place then is there for thanksgiving for boundless favours? The wild steeds of the o'er mastering passions of such self-pleasers have not such docility! that their bridles can be tightened by the hand of chiding, or their reins turned by the outspread fingers of counsel!\n\nAt length His Majesty, in accordance with the decrees of fate, marched from K\u0101bul and encamped at Qar\u0101 B\u0101gh. From thence he went to C\u0101rik\u0101r\u0101n and from there to the river B\u0101r\u0101n. It happened that there was a stream on this stage and that His Majesty crossed it on horseback, whilst his followers went off in different directions seeking for a safe passage. His Majesty did not approve of this and instanced in reproof of this disaffected crew, the conduct of the devotees of Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101'il \u0160af\u0101vi, who flung themselves down from a sky-high mountain to seize his handkerchief and made for themselves a lofty foundation of fame and life-sacrifice. Such was His Majesty's sound opinion of his followers on this occasion, and such was their pusillanimous circumspection. In fine Qar\u0101ca Qar\u0101bakht and Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Mun\u1e63iq and others, who were burning torches of sedition, represented, directly and indirectly, that they had to do with mountains, and\n\n1 Khudr\u0101t\u012b, which is short for Khud-d\u0101r\u012b. See Vullers I. 744a.\nthat there were many defiles; that the Mirz\u0101 would have few men with him, and that the loyal should be stationed on different roads, so that the Mirz\u0101 should not be able to come out. The whole idea of these evil-minded ones was to disperse the army so that M. K\u0101mr\u0101n's purpose might be effected. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, who in his noble nature only believed good of men, thought the plan of these traitors a good one and sent H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n K\u014dk\u012b, M\u012br Barka, M. \u1e24asan Kh\u0101n, B\u0101h\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, Khw. Jal\u0101l-d-d\u012bn Mahm\u016bd, Calp\u012b Beg, Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Beg Turkm\u0101n, Shaikh Bahl\u016bl, \u1e24aidar Q\u0101sim K\u014dhbar, and Sh\u0101h Quli N\u0101ranj\u012b to Zuhhaq and B\u0101mi\u0101n, and appointed Mun'im Kh\u0101n and a large body of troops to S\u0101l Aulang. Qar\u0101ca, and Mu\u1e63\u0101\u1e25ib, Q\u0101sim \u1e2ausain Sl. and a number who remained with His Majesty, drew up daily an account of His Majesty's position and sent it to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, and were continually representing to His Majesty that this time the Mirz\u0101 had no other idea but to serve him.\n\nWhen there were few loyalists in attendance, and the convention of hypocrites was powerful, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, who had been confounded by the royal pomp and the large army and had been unable either to quit the service (of the king) or to go forward and do homage, having become acquainted by the brokerage of the hypocrites with their treachery, turned off from the road by Zuhhaq and B\u0101mi\u0101n towards Dara Qib\u0101q which is a dependency of Gh\u016brband. Y\u0101s\u012bn Daulat, Maqdum K\u014dka and B\u0101b\u0101 Sa'id led the advance, while he himself was in the centre. His men were arranged in two bodies. It was midday when His Majesty was apprised by a peasant of that quarter of the coming of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, and of his evil intentions. Qar\u0101ca who was the ringleader of the ill-disposed, represented that if one listened to the tales of a man like this and placed reliance on such false rumours, hearts would be divided, and the people (K\u0101mr\u0101n's followers) would become apprehensive. Should there be a desire to give battle on account of this news, and should warlike preparations be made, certainly when M. K\u0101mr\u0101n heard of them, he would desist from his\n\n1 This pass is marked on the map appended to Yule's introduction to Wood's Journey. It is also called C\u0101rd\u0101r and lies S.E. of the Dand\u0101n Shikan. See also B\u0101bar's Mem., p. 139.\n\n2 B\u0101yaz\u012bd says a servant of the Mir Mungh\u012b brought the news and made such an uproar that Hum\u0101y\u016bn, according to Erskine, had him put to death, but perhaps the words only mean that he was beaten.\ndesire of entering into service. Meanwhile the news of the Mirza's coming and of his wicked intentions became stronger and more continuous. Wondrous to relate, the hypocrisy and inmost thought of those hypocrites had not yet been revealed on the mirror of His Majesty's mind. Nought entered his holy heart save good thoughts of people, till at length it became established that the enemy was coming and coming with a hostile intention. An order was given that all who were with him should mount their horses. He himself put the foot of courage in the stirrup of enterprise and in a short time there was a hot engagement. Pir Muhammad Shah, who was one of the devoted followers and Muhammad Khan Jalair and many other brave men moved forward. Pir Muhammad Shah, who was athirst for the stream of life-sacrifice, brought his foot into the circle of conflicts and so watered the sword of battle in slaying the foe, that he himself was swept away by the foam. M. Quli made his steed so rush about in the field of contest that after slaughtering crowds of wretches he, in the press and confusion, fell wounded from his horse. His son Dost Muhammad could not endure to see him in the power of the foe, and ran to his help. While his father yet lived, he killed his adversary, and had such contests that he too was swept away, and disappeared. His Majesty Jahangiri got upon a rising ground and calculated the strength of friend and foe. By seeing the manner in which some of his servants were killed, and by seeing others go in crowds over to the enemy, the truth of the fraud and treachery of those scoundrels became apparent to him. His native valour and intrepidity were stirred up, and seizing a lance he himself rushed against the foe. They were scattered before him, but an arrow wounded his horse and Beg Babul of Kulab came from behind, and\n\n1 From A.F.'s account it would appear that M. Quli was killed, as well as his son. According to the Masir I. 557 and Blochmann 835 M. Quli did not die till 938 but the M. Quli of the battle of Gobek is not the M. Quli who was Haidar Muhammad's brother. The Tabaqat, Elliot V. 229 calls the son Ahmad. Bayazid says, 51b that Pir Muhammad was killed by an arrow, that M. Quli's horse was killed, and M. Quli's leg broken. Then he adds, \"Imam Quli and his son belonged to the body-guard. The son ran to his father to put him on horseback, but he too suffered martyrdom.\" This looks as if Bayazid regarded M. Quli and Imam Quli as the same person. The M. Quli who was killed has the title of Celi. See Erakine's history.\nknowingly\\(^1\\) or unknowingly struck him a blow with his sword. His Majesty turned round and gave him an angry look which caused him\\(^2\\) to stumble. Mihtar\\(^3\\) Sak\u0101i known as Farhat Kh\u0101n came and put that wretch to flight, and M. Nij\u0101t tendered his piebald horse to His Majesty who took it and gave the M\u012brz\u0101 his. Meanwhile \u2018Abdu-l-wahh\u0101b, one of the yas\u012bwal came and telling how the officers had joined with M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, seized His Majesty's rein. \u201cWhat time was it,\u201d he said, for fighting. The bucket of success must at one time come up full from the waters of hope and at another, it must, by a revolution of the wheel, go down empty.\u201d\n\nHail! eternal fate! which rules the beggar and the king, and directs the cycle of fortune and misfortune, which holds the key of deliverance for those in bonds, and causeth the exalted to fall. Until men have passed through the dark night of the hours of affliction, they know not the glory of the world-warming sun, and until the thirsty lips have sought the desert mirage, they are not watered at the spring of desire. This event is a proof of this, for on that day there was the apparition of the eventual salvation of His Majesty. He proceeded to Zuh\u0101q and B\u0101mi\u0101n whither he had sent many of his loyal officers. \u2018Abdu-l-wahh\u0101b, Farhat Khan, Mu\u1e25ammad \u0100m\u012bn, Sabdal\\(^4\\) Kh\u0101n and others accompanied him. Mu\u1e25ammad \u0100m\u012bn and \u2018Abdu-l-wahh\u0101b were ordered to form the rear guard. On account of weakness and of the distress from his wound, he took off his cuirass and made it over to Sabdal Kh\u0101n who, out of stupidity, flung it away. Next day many of his servants joined him. One day he sent Sh\u0101h Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n, T\u016blak Q\u016bc\u012bn, and Mejn\u016bn Q\u0101qsh\u0101l\u2014ten in all,\u2014towards K\u0101bul to serve as a rear guard and also to keep a look out, but T\u016blak Q\u016bc\u012bn only returned. He was received with favour on that market day of testing and raised to the office of Q\u016brbe\u011f\u0113. The confidential servants were summoned and a council was held. H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n whose fief\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e., either he recognised him or he did not.\n\n\\(^2\\) From the Iqb\u0101ln\u0101ma it would appear that the word dast should be separated from \u1e6de\u1e63, and that the phrase is, dast az pa kha\u1e6d\u0101kard, meaning that Beg B\u0101ba grew confused,\n\nlit. did not know his hand from his foot.\n\n\\(^3\\) Blochmann 488. From Jauhar it would appear that he was an Abyssinian slave.\n\n\\(^4\\) Blochmann 441.\nwas Ghaznin, and on whose heart's fireplace dissimulation was pre-\neminently concocted; recommended a march to Qandahar. This\nhowever was not approved of. A number of the right-thinking\nrecommended marching to Badakhshan, and then proceeding to K\u00e2bul\nalong with M\u00eerz\u00e2 Sulaim\u00e2n, Hind\u00e2l and Ibr\u00e2h\u00eem. A party of\ndevoted heroes suggested that to-day M. K\u00e2mr\u00e2n was intoxicated\nwith the mischievous wine of the hypocrites and narrow-souled ones\nand off his guard, while they had the good fortune to be at the feet\nof His Majesty. On what other day would they be successful?\u00b9 The\nproper thing was that they should all with one heart march to K\u00e2bul.\nThere was a confident hope that they would be able to dispose of M.\nK\u00e2mr\u00e2n without going to Badakhshan. As recent evidence had\nbeen obtained of the deceit and hypocrisy of very many of the\nnurslings of the Court, reliance was not put upon this opinion and\nthe cautious course seemed to be to proceed to Badakhshan. Ac-\ncordingly he ordered a march by the route of Yekka Aulang. At\nsuch a time as this H\u00e2j\u00ee Mu\u1e25ammad obtained leave for his brother\nSh\u00e2h Mu\u1e25ammad and his men and sent them to Ghaznin! His\nMajesty with his own holy hand wrote a letter to His Majesty the\nSh\u00e2h\u00eensh\u00e2h announcing his safety and made it over to him (Sh\u00e2h\nMu\u1e25ammad) in order that he might by every possible\u00b2 means convey\nit to him. He also sent verbal messages of victory and promises of\nhis coming. And he bade him (Sh\u00e2h Mu\u1e25ammad) go quickly to\nGhaznin and make every effort for keeping it safe till his return\nwhich, he trusted, would soon occur. Though the loyal represented\nthat to separate hypocrites from himself at such a time was to put the\nreins of hypocritical actions into the hands of these unreliables and\nforward the schemes of the seditions, and though every one re-\npresented, either openly or by hints, that he (H\u00e2j\u00ee Mu\u1e25ammad), was\nsending his brother to M. K\u00e2mr\u00e2n, and that he himself was seeking\nto be a household-spy and a deceiver of simple believers, His Majesty\ndid not give heed and granted leave to Sh\u00e2h Mu\u1e25ammad. Next day\n\n\u00b9 This is evidently the Alanjak of\nStewart's Jauhar, 98. It was an\nAim\u00e2q settlement and lies about\nthirty miles S.-W. of B\u00e2mi\u00e2n.\n(B\u00e2bar's Mem., 211n.).\n\n\u00b2 Sh\u00e2h Mu\u1e25ammad's route to\nGhaznin would probably take him\nnear K\u00e2bul.\nhe proceeded towards Kahmard. Many faithless ones separated from his service, but all who observed the limits of loyalty and were careful of their good name, stayed with him and bound the girdle of service on the waist of fidelity.\n\nAfter travelling three days on this road, T\u016blakj\u012b and S\u0101nq\u0101j\u012b, the headmen of the Aim\u0101qs who live there, brought horses and sheep to the utmost of their power and presented them. They rendered acceptable service. His Majesty encamped at night near one of their settlements. When he mounted his horse in the morning, news was brought that a large caravan had arrived under the charge of Mir Saiyid \u2018Al\u012b of Sabzaw\u0101r. Merchants from Ir\u0101q and Khur\u0101s\u0101n had many horses and other goods with them and were on their way to India. At the end of the day the chiefs of the caravan were admitted to the Presence. The providential arrival of this large party was the beginning of celestial victories. The prudent and farseeing merchants recognised a great auspiciousness for themselves in the favour of so great a prince, and in assisting him; and tendered all their horses and goods as a present. His Majesty perceived that this was an aid from heaven and took a portion of the goods at four or five times their value, and divided them among his followers and intimates. He also set aside presents for each of the princes of Badakhsh\u0101n. The remainder he returned to them that they might sell the articles wherever they chose. Next day he arrived at Kahmard. T\u0101hir Mu\u1e25ammad, son of Mir Khurd was there. He recognised the arrival as a great favour and paid his respects, but either from meanness or not having materials, he could not with regard to his entertainment, succeed in wiping the sweat of shame from the face of his service. From there after two days and a night (shab darmiy\u0101n) they arrived at the bank of the river Bangi. From the other side a man called out \u201cO men of the caravan,\u201d have you any news among you of the King? When His Majesty heard him,\n\n1 From this point A.F. seems to follow Jauhar. B\u0101yaz\u012bd was not with Humay\u016bn in the retreat, he having fled towards K\u0101bul. Perhaps the names T\u0101lakj\u012b and S\u0101nq\u0101j\u012b are those of tribes and not of individuals. S\u0101nq\u0101j\u012b looks to be a variant of the tribal name S\u0101lq\u0101n\u012b mentioned at Text, p. 276, 8 lines from foot.\n\n2 dah cahal u dah panj\u0101h. Cf. B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem., 188.\n\n3 See Jauhar, Stewart, 98.\nhe forbade any one to give news, and asked the man who he was, and who had sent him, and what news there was among them about the King. The man answered that he was sent by Nazari of S\u0101l' Aulang to get news of the King, and that the report among them was that the King had come out of the battle wounded, and that after that no one had seen him. The M\u012brz\u0101's men had found the royal j\u012bba (cuirass or corselet) which the King had worn on that day and had brought it to the M\u012brz\u0101 who had rejoiced thereat, and had instituted feasts. His Majesty summoned him to his presence and asked him if he knew him. He replied that the Divine effulgence does not remain hid. His Majesty said, \"Go and convey the good tidings to Nazari, and tell him to make himself ready, so that at the time of my return he may perform acceptable service.\" Next day he crossed by a ford and reached the village of Auliya Khanj\u0101n. Here M. 300 Hind\u0101l joined him and was exalted by tendering presents. After that he encamped at Andar\u0101b. M\u012brz\u0101s Sulaim\u0101n and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm did homage and formed the part of loyalists.\n\nAs the narrative has proceeded so far, it is necessary that before His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni shall have assembled his army and marched to the conquest of K\u0101bul, the pen should take up the account of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n from the beginning of his treachery till his coming out from K\u0101bul, which was the beginning of his punishment, so that the lips athirst for the wine of words, may be moistened from the watering place of this supplement.\n\nWhen the stewards of destiny brought forth from a hidden quarter, for the confirmation of the royal, ever-during dominion, and for the confounding of the masters of hypocrisy, such a victory in the guise of defeat, and such joy in the garb of sorrow, and when His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni proceeded by the arrangement of devoted loyalists, towards Zuhh\u0101q and B\u0101mi\u0101n, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was amazed at\n\n1 This, seems to be the Saulah-Aulang (between Panjh\u016b and Ghurband) of Jarrett II. 400n. Nazari is perhaps the Mr Nazari of the Turkish admiral Sidi 'Ali, Vamb\u00e9ry, 65 and 66.\n\n2 The Khinj\u0101n of the maps, W.S.-W. of Andar\u0101b. But the river when the conversation with Nazari's servant took place, can hardly have been the Bangi. The text has \u0100d\u012b Khinj\u0101n. In the government-map of Afghanistan, the town is called Khinj\u0101n Wal\u012b\u0101n. They appear to be two places. See B\u0101bar's Mem., 139, and Jarrett II. 400.\nthe appearance of so wondrous an event, such as he had never imagined as likely to happen. The hypocrites joined him in crowds, and that foolish one was excited and delighted by the coming of those triflers and stretched out the arm of oppression upon the faithful who were firmly grasping the pinnacle of fidelity to the king. On the very field of battle B\u0101b\u0101 Sa\u02bf\u012bd brought Qar\u0101ca Qarabakht wounded before the Mirz\u0101. The latter was gracious and inquired about his evil-ending condition. He replied that B\u0101b\u0101 Sa\u02bf\u012bd had wounded him unawares and the Mirz\u0101 proceeded to console that cheat by baseless favours. After that B\u0101b\u0101 D\u014dst yas\u0101wal and a number of others brought forward \u1e24usain Quli muhrdar, who was one of the devoted loyalists, that evildoer struck with his own sword this faithful servant and ordered him to be cut to pieces in his presence. Thus this fundholder in loyalty\u2019s treasure-house sold in his benefactor\u2019s service a fleeting life and a contingent existence for the coin of fidelity, and thereby became for ever a sharer in the banquet of the true and the loyal. They also brought in Takhji Beg who was a Caghat\u0101i officer and reckoned among the faithful. Him too they put to the sword without hesitation. After that Beg B\u0101b\u0101l of K\u016bl\u0101b came forward and told the story of the wounding of His Majesty. The Mirz\u0101 was jubilant and sent Y\u0101sin Daulat and Maqdam Koka and a body of men in pursuit. Q\u0101sim \u1e24usain Sl. had on this day shown treachery and blindness of heart. From the trepidation and fear which cling to the skirt of the disloyal, he took refuge on the side of the mountain and in his confusion did not know whether to advance or fly. \u1e24asan \u015eadr and a number more were sent to him and they, by soothments and encouragement, brought him in. The Mirz\u0101 left the field of battle and came to C\u0101r\u012bk\u0101r\u0101n. Here a man brought His Majesty\u2019s special corselet to the Mirz\u0101 who was so exultant that he could not contain himself for joy (lit. his clothes were not large enough for him). He marched from thence and besieged K\u0101bul. Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n Barl\u0101s was in the service of His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h, and was looking after the security of the fort. Though the Mirz\u0101 made false promises to him, he would not sever the strong cord of fidelity which bound him to\n\n1 No doubt \u1e24usain Quli\u2019s title of muhrdar, = sealer, and also gold muhr holder has suggested this simile to the author.\nHis Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, till false rumours were spread and the corselet (jiba) was sent. The fort was taken by dint of hundreds of false promises and by staking lying tales. The new fruit of the garden of creation and nosegay of the spring of horizons, viz., His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h who was perfuming the nostrils of the age, and from whose brows of fortune there radiated the light of the Divine Khil\u0101fat, was made a prisoner. But the Divine protection, which is ever near him, watched in the old fashion over that prince, outwardly small but grand in reality.\n\nM. K\u0101mr\u0101n having taken possession of K\u0101bul, set about arranging his affairs and organising his army. He gave in fief to M. \u2018Ashar\u012b, J\u016bl Sh\u0101h\u012b which is now known as Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d, in accordance with the auspicious title of the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h. It is a delightful spot and a partition (barzakh) between India and foreign countries, being replete with the advantages of the one and exempt from the evils of the other. It was Munim Kh\u0101n who gave it its holy appellation and who colonised it. Ghaznin and its territory were given to Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n and Gh\u016brband and its neighbourhood to Y\u0101s\u012bn Daulat. In this manner fiefs and grants were made to his followers. The royal servants were laid hold of, Khw. Sl. \u2018Ali the diw\u0101n being imprisoned, and the hand of oppression was opened and money and goods were taken from him and used for evil purposes. But the Mirz\u0101 was ever in dread of the approach of the royal army, and could not pass his days in tranquillity. The direction of affairs was with Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n and Khw. Q\u0101sim the Mir Buy\u016btat, and by means of oppression and tyranny materials which in fact were no materials were got together, forgetting the verse:\n\nVerse.\n\nWho take dirams by force and give gold for ornamentation,\nDig up the foundation of the mosque\u00b2 and gild the palace-roof.\n\nAbout three months were spent in this way till the sound of the approach of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b from Badakhsh\u0101n rose high in the province of K\u0101bul. The Mirz\u0101 collected soldiers and\n\n\u00b9 The Lucknow editor illustrates this verse by a quotation from Sa\u2019d\u012b.\n\u00b2 \u2018Amr which means both life and mosques.\nzam\u012bnd\u0101rs from the Haz\u0101ras and others and set off with a full equipment. He left B\u0101b\u0101 J\u016bjak and Mull\u0101 Shaf\u0101\u012b in K\u0101bul, and took His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bngh\u0101h,\u2014the marks of auspiciousness in whom were apparent, and were acknowledged by small and great and by friend and foe,\u2014with him, either to bring himself good fortune or for greater security. Nor was he aware that God, the giver of life and adorer of the world, had assigned the benign influences of both worlds which were implanted in this holy personality to his friends, not to his foes. What lustre does antimony give to the blind?\n\nNow that this parenthetical narrative has been completed, we must return to our subject and briefly describe the remaining occurrences of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b.\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nRETURN OF HIS MAJESTY JAHANBANI JANNAAT-ASHYANI FROM BADAKHSHAN, AND HIS BATTLE WITH M. KAXRAN, AND ARRIVAL IN KABUL AFTER THE VICTORY.\n\nWhen His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had encamped at Ander\u0101b and the Mirz\u0101s had waited upon him, as has already been related, he, in a short time, got together an army and prepared to march through the passes of the Hind\u016b Koh. As there were a number of traitors and false-hearted ones in attendance, His Majesty, in order to conciliate and to give repose to the exoteric, came down from the heaven of his nature (fi\u1e6drat)\u00b9 and took his seat on the earth of the spirit (jab\u02bfat) of the age and brought forward the proposition of an oath, which is regarded by the worshippers of form as of great weight, suggesting that he should administer a special oath to each section (gir\u0101h) to the effect that they would accompany him with one heart and will. And he observed that, though the creative, Divine pen was the recorder of duties, and though it was the Divine help which caused and established in the right way the actions of the loyal, and though his own empire-viewing mind was at rest with regard to them all, yet he desired to in some measure enlighten the hearts of worldlings who could see nothing except what was symptomatic (sahab) and that the countenance of truth might display her perfect beauty in the mirror of their actions.\u00b2 Upon this \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Kok\u012b, who had no reverence and no sincerity of heart,\n\n\u00b9 \"The difference between fi\u1e6drat and jab\u02bfat is that the former signifies the essential nature of the individual man, the latter the super-induced accidents of temperament which are more under his control.\" (Jarrett III. 403 note).\n\n\u00b2 The meaning is that though Humayun was satisfied of their fidelity, yet for the sake of outsiders he wished them to take an oath so that their loyalty should thereby be evidenced.\nrepresented that in accordance with orders they would all take the oath, let His Majesty take an oath also, to the effect that he would listen to and carry into effect what they, the loyalists, should in their right thinking perceive and should represent to him. M. Hind\u0101l who was imbued with devotion and had a knowledge of affairs, said \"H\u0101ji Muhammad, what sort of story is this you are saying, and what kind of oath is this? Never have servants said such words to their masters, or slaves to their lords.\" His Majesty who was a mine of urbanity\u2014and a sea of generosity, said, \"So be it. We shall do whatever H\u0101ji Muhammad wishes and shall, in his loyalty, suggest.\" After making confirmatory oaths and agreements, they marched from that place.\n\nWhen the grand army came near Ushtar Gr\u0101m M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, according to his wont and in his folly, made preparations for war and having collected a body of troops marched against the royal army. When there was only a little distance between the two armies His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni in adherence to his affectionate nature sent M. Sh\u0101h, a relative of Mir Barka who belonged to the illustrious Saiyids of Termiz, to the M\u012brz\u0101, and conveyed weighty advices such as might be earrings for the ears of men of fortune and prestige. The gist of them was that to take always the path of opposition and to abandon the high-way of concord was remote from wisdom. God forbid that all this contention should take place about K\u0101bul. Respect obligations, old and new, and observe the ways of peace and candour, and be of one heart and accept companionship in the conquest of India. The Saiyid performed his mission, and peace was agreed upon, but on the condition that as Qandah\u0101r belonged to His Majesty, K\u0101bul should belong to K\u0101mr\u0101n; upon these terms he would enter into service and take part in the conquest of India. As His Majesty was kind and affectionate, he sent the ambassador a second time, along with Maulana 'Abdu-l-b\u0101qi Sadr and sent a\n\n1 See the interesting remarks of Erskine on this incident. (Hist. II. 387-90). Jauhar (Stewart 99), mentions it and says that Hum\u0101y\u016bn had fasted all the day in order to give the ceremony more solemnity.\n\n2 Erskine says he was related to the imperial family. Perhaps he was descended from M\u012br 'Al\u012b-ul-Mulk of Termiz who had married Fakhir-jah\u0101n, a daughter of Ab\u0101 Sa'id.\nmessage that if K\u0101mr\u0101n was sincere and really wished to take the road of concord, he should give his dear daughter in marriage to the unique pearl of the khil\u0101fat, viz., His Majesty the Sh\u0101hsh\u0101h\u012b, so that His Majesty might bestow K\u0101bul upon them, and that they two (Hum\u0101y\u016bn and K\u0101mr\u0101n) might unite in destroying the darkness of the great country of India, and might make that last which had become the stage of wicked men and of calamities, an abode of peace and tranquillity. Both K\u0101bul and Hind\u016bst\u0101n would then in reality belong to the two of them. The M\u012brz\u0101 wished to accept these wise suggestions but Qar\u0101ca Qar\u0101bakht, who was the centre of his power, did not agree and said \"Our heads\" and K\u0101bul.\"\n\nIn fact on that day the Eight Stars were in front of the M\u012brz\u0101 and, according to astrologers, to fight under these circumstances is to be defeated, and so the M\u012brz\u0101 by stratagems put off the fight to another day. The victorious army (Hum\u0101y\u016bn's) was anxious to engage, but H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad did not want this, and His Majesty in deference to him, delayed to give battle. Meanwhile Khw. 'Abdu-s-\u1e62amad and many others who had gone to a distance during the battle of Qib\u0101q, took advantage of their opportunity and joined His Majesty, and brought tidings of the vacillation and confusion in the hostile army. Half the day had passed when His Majesty put the foot of firmness in the stirrup of intent, and having drawn up his forces, and arranged them in right and left wings, centre and vanguard, ordered an advance. The centre derived glory from his own presence, the right wing was made illustrious by M. Sulaim\u0101n, and the left wing by M. Hind\u0101l. M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm had charge of the vanguard. H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and other tried heroes had charge of the reserve.\n\n1 Sir-i-m\u0101 u K\u0101bul. Erskine says this is equivalent to death in K\u0101bul. Perhaps the meaning rather is that their heads and Kabul were equally dear, and that neither could be given up. Or perhaps that the only two conditions of peace were that they should save their heads and also keep K\u0101bul.\n\n2 Sakist\u0101n. See Steingass s.v. and B\u0101bar's Mem., 92. It appears to be an old name for the constellation of Virgo, and to be the same word as the Secdeidos of \u0100b\u016b-M\u0101gh\u012br of Balkh. See Ideler's Untersuchungen, 1809, and Athenaeum of 19th May, 1900.\n\n3 Ilmi\u0101h, given in Meninski as meaning sixty and so equal to veteran. But it is the reserve, apparently, of the front-ranks or vanguard. As Mr. Irvine has pointed\nOn the other side, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was in the centre, M. \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b on the right, \u0100q Sult\u0101n on the left, and Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n on the vanguard. The two armies moved on, in appearance like two iron mountains, and approached each other. Mihtar Sahb\u0101ka and a number of faithful servants who had after the affair of Qabcaq entered, from necessity, the service of the Mirz\u0101, galloped off and joined the victorious army. Near the river M\u016br\u012b, M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm in his high courage, took the lead. The soldiers on both sides fought bravely. At this time the head of Qar\u0101ca Kh\u0101n was brought before the world-traversing steed (of Hum\u0101y\u016bn) and all were freed from the malice of that troublesome traitor. An order was given that the guilty head of that faithless one should be stuck up at the Iron gate of K\u0101bul so that it might be a warning to the seditious. Thus the words which he himself had uttered \u201cOur heads and K\u0101bul,\u201d were brought to pass. I have heard from reliable persons that a low follower of the Mirz\u0101 seized the traitor and wished to take him before His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b as an atonement for his offences and that Qambar \u2018Al\u012b Sah\u0101r\u012b\u00b9 who was a servant of M. Hind\u0101l and whose brother had been killed in Qandah\u0101r by Qar\u0101ca, was following and that he took off his (Qar\u0101ca\u2019s) cap (t\u0101q\u012bya) and struck him on the crown of the head with his sword, splitting it, and then cutting off the head brought it to His Majesty.\n\nDuring this conflict and tumult, in which the royal servants fought with devotion, knowing that it was the end of the contest, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n could not maintain his ground and took to flight. He went off to Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n by the Pass of B\u0101dpaj\u00b2 (the windy pass). The victorious army betook itself to plunder and got hold of much property. The enemies of the State were seized and put to the sword, many of them lowered the veil of shame over their faces and made the tears of repentance their intercessors and after a thousand reproaches, were enrolled in the list of servants of the State. M. \u2018Ask\u0101r\u012b fell into the hands of the heroes of the army (\u2018\u0100sk\u0101r). A victory such as might be the introduction to countless victories, was obtained\n\n\u00b9 Text, Sah\u0101r\u012b, but there is the variant Bah\u0101r\u012b, and this is the word in Nig\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn. Sah\u0101r\u012b however appears to be right. There was a Sark\u0101r of that name in the Agra division. See Jarrett II. 195.\n\u00b2 B\u0101bar\u2019s Mem., 142 note 4. By Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n is meant the country east of K\u0101bul.\nand was the subject of thousands of rejoicings. But the heart of His Majesty was very anxious about the safety of the jewel of empire's diadem, viz., His Majesty the Shahinshah, for he had heard that on this occasion M. K\u00e2mr\u00e2n had brought him with him. His Majesty could get no comfort from his distraction until Hassan Akhta brought that rosebush of fortune's rose-garden, and cypress of the parterre of sovereignty before him. Recognising his advent as the beginning of fortune, he returned thanks to God for his safety and the realisation of his hopes, and with excessive joy, he clasped that Divine nursling to his bosom. After his devotions he distributed charities,\u2014which are the practical form of thanksgiving,\u2014and drew to himself the hearts of the poor and the widowed and orphaned by abundant presents. And he rewarded every one of the devoted servants either because of the happy issue of events with regard to the eye-pupil of the Khilafat or as a guerdon (jald\u00fb) for good service.\n\nHis Majesty Jah\u00e2nban\u00ee announced that in future he never would be separated from this new fruit of the garden of the Khilafat,\u2014for thousands of good auspices were infolded in his footsteps,\u2014and he recognised that the glorious victory came from the blessing of the advent of this sublime pearl. At this joyous time two camels loaded with boxes and without drivers were seen on the field of battle. His Majesty said \"every one is having his plunder, let mine be these two camels!\" He went himself and taking their nose-strings, ordered that they should be made to kneel and that the boxes should be opened, so that he might see what was inside. By a beautiful coincidence it was found that the special, royal books which were lost at the battle of Qib\u00e7aq were in these boxes and in perfect condition. This was the occasion for a thousand rejoicings. Khw. Q\u00e2sim Mir buy\u00fbt\u00e2t, who was the kindler of the fire of strife, was consumed in the flames of this battle by the fire of his own deeds, and so commotion and depravity were set at rest. On this day a joyous assemblage was held in C\u00e2rik\u00e2r\u00e2n.\n\nWhen by the favour of God, the gates of victory had been opened and the seditious had been punished, K\u00e2bul became on the following day the alighting place for blessed feet and a station of everlasting auspiciousness. First, His Majesty entered the citadel and had the joy of receiving his chaste ladies. After that he, according to his wont, proceeded to the \u00darta B\u00e2gh and freshened it\nby his fortunate presence. There he made arrangements for his subjects and dominions, rewarding the good servants and punishing the bad. Dind\u0101r Beg, Haidar Dost Mughal Q\u0101nji, and Mast \u2018Ali who had on many occasions shown disloyalty, were capitally punished in accordance with their deserts, and the public benefit. He exercised his genius in the distribution of justice. M. Sulaim\u0101n was loaded with gifts and dismissed to Badakhsh\u0101n. M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm remained for some days, as a special mark of favour, and then was sent to Badakhsh\u0101n. And it was settled that in an auspicious hour he should be married to His Majesty\u2019s daughter Bakhshi B\u0101n\u016b. His Majesty\u2019s world-adorning heart engaged in the arrangement of affairs and exalted all the servants by his affability and benevolence.\n\n1 B\u0101yaz\u012bd says Mast \u2018Ali\u2019s offence was his refusing to fight at Qibc\u0101q on the plea that a bad cuirass had been given to him, that Haidar Dost Mughal Q\u0101nji was punished for inciting Qar\u0101ca to rebellion, and that Dind\u0101r was punished for offences committed in India.\n\n2 Akbar\u2019s half-sister. After Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s death she married Sharafu-d\u012bn Husain (Blochmann 322). In Gulbadan\u2019s Memoirs the name is spelt Ikhs\u012b which is a Turki word meaning good, and possibly this is the proper spelling. Redhouse gives it the meaning of beautiful.\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF THE VILLAGE OF CARKH\\(^1\\) TO HIS MAJESTY THE SH\u0100HAN-\nSH\u0100H, AND THE PROGNOSTICATIONS THEREFROM OF THE FAR-BEING.\\(^2\\)\n\nAt this time, when, by God\u2019s help, K\u0101bul had become the seat\nof the thrones of sovereignty and the spot irradiated by the lights\nof the Khilafat, the village of Carkh\u2014which belongs to the t\u016bm\u0101n\nof Lah\u016bgar,\u2014was assigned to His Majesty the Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h. The\nenlightened drew an omen from this mysterious gift, and beat the\ndrum of rejoicing high o\u2019er the nine spheres (carkh). His Majesty gave\nto \u1e24\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad the office of household-administrator (wak\u0101lat-i-\ndarkh\u0101na, mayoralty of the palace), which is a very great post,\u2014and\nbade him mend his ways. But as, owing to his narrow understand-\ning, he was intoxicated with his courage and proud of his reputation,\nevil thoughts continually held him in the prison of affliction (gham),\nand he was always ungrateful and showing improper desires. His\nMajesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni, from his lofty nature and a tolerance which was\nboundless, used to pass this over; for the excellent principle of this\nruler was that the plant of the human life,\u2014which is the product of\nthe Divine workmanship and the fruit-bearing growth of the garden\nof fate, should not be pulled up for every defect, especially in the\ncase of one who was distinguished among his equals for wisdom or\ncourage or for any other fine quality. But that evil-constituted\nwretch thought, in his folly and wrong-headedness, that this was a\nweakness (in Hum\u0101y\u016bn), and so made it an incitement to still greater\nmadness; while His Majesty always winked at such conduct and\nloaded him with favours. At this auspicious time, His Majesty\ncontinually kept open the gates of justice and distributed favours\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See B\u0101ber\u2019s Memoirs 148, and Jarrett II. 406. It is S.E. of K\u0101bul. A.F. puns on the meaning of the word carkh, infra.\n\n\\(^2\\) This heading is very inadequate.\nupon which the administration of the terrene and terrestrials depends, and knit together the distractions and dispersions of the time.\n\nM. K\u0101mr\u0101n, after his defeat, went off from the village of Ushtar-gram, in the most wretched circumstances,\u2014such as were the just result of his ingratitude and the fruit of his oblivion of benefits,\u2014with eight followers (viz., \u0100q Sl., brother of Khizr Khw. Kh\u0101n, B\u0101b\u0101 Sa'id Qibc\u0101q, Tamar T\u0101sh atga, Qatlaq Qadam, 'Ali Mu\u1e25ammad, J\u014dg\u012b Kh\u0101n, Abd\u0101l, and Maq\u1e63\u016bd q\u016br\u010d\u012b),\u2014by way of Dih-i-sabz, and joined the Afgh\u0101ns. M. Hind\u0101l, H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, Khizr Khw. Kh\u0101n and the others who had gone in pursuit, did not exercise proper diligence and returned. The Afgh\u0101ns blocked the M\u012brz\u0101's path and plundered him, and he, fearing lest he should be recognized, shaved all the hair from his face (c\u0101r zarb zada) and came, disguised as a galandar to Malik Mu\u1e25ammad of Mandraur, one of the leading men of the Lamgh\u0101n\u0101t, who recognized old obligations and tended him. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was not in the least awakened by all these disasters,\u2014every one of which was, in the eyes of the wise, a strong whip of warning and of arousing from the sleep of negligence,\u2014but again stretched himself out in slumber. A number of soldiers who had the form of men but neither the heart to perceive what was right nor the eye to feel shame and who were always practising sedition and treachery, gathered round him.\n\nWhen this news came to the sublime camp, the market of hypocrites grew brisk and the loyal were distressed. At such a time as this, when the flame of sedition and strife had become tongued, H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n went off to Ghaznin without leave. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, from desire to temporize and also from his perfect appreciation (of the man), regarded this disgraceful proceeding as love of opposition (? n\u0101zjang)\u00b2 and did not approve of it. He appointed Bah\u0101dur\n\n\u00b9 According to Gulbadan Begam, he left K\u0101mr\u0101n (who was his father-in-law) about this time and was, in consequence, deprived of his wife. He was a younger brother of Gulbadan's husband, Khizr.\n\n\u00b2 The reading and meaning are uncertain. The Bodleian MSS. appear to give n\u0101z-khunuk, i.e., coldness of love, or n\u0101z-kakk, the erasing of love. If may also be n\u0101z-khang, love of depravity. The I.O. MS. No. 4 has n\u0101z-khunuk quite clearly. Most probably the true reading is n\u0101z-khang, wickedness, for A.F. has other similar uses of khang. (See I. 198 l. 15 and 334 l. 9, where we have the word khang following la'assub and used in the sense of evil bigotry.\nCHAPTER L.\n\nEXPEDITION OF HIS MAJESTY JAHANBANI TO EXTINGUISH ANOTHER TIME THE SEDITIOUS FLAMES OF M. KAMRAN.\n\nInasmuch as habit is, as they say, a fifth humour of the body,\u2014whoever is addicted to evil ways is like the scorpion, and in stinging is without the power of self-control. How much more they who are constitutionally bad and in whom habit accords with nature. Accordingly M. Kamran again inclined towards his disposition and practice and made his evil deeds the instrument of his own punishment. He gathered together a number of Afghans from the Khalil and Mahmand tribes and a troop of vagabonds who could not distinguish good from evil, and set about plundering and ravaging. His Majesty Jahangiri, who was the giver of peace to the world and the age, recognized that the ending of such tumults was a part of worship, and he resolved to act in accordance therewith. He sent Khw. Ikhtiyar and Mir 'Abdu-l-hai, who were confidential courtiers, to Ghaznin, to convey a gracious letter to Haji Muhammad and recall him from the darkness of evil thoughts to the light of recognition of duty. While His Majesty was making his preparations, he heard that M. Kamran was besieging, with a number of vagabonds, a fort near Carbagh, in the vicinity of Jalalabad. He therefore did not wait for Haji Muhammad Khan, but went off with all rapidity towards Jalalabad. When M. Kamran heard this, he was amazed and fled. He again betook himself to the defiles and went off from there by Bangash and Gardiz, thinking that he might join Haji Muhammad. For this perverse wretch held with M. Kamran.\n\nThe story of Haji Muhammad is as follows. As the time of his ruin approached, evil thoughts came forth more and more from his\n\n---\n\n1 Muhammadans reckon that there are four humours in man. See Lane S. v. Alg. 788b. They derived the notion from Hippocrates and Galen.\nimpure heart, and he dismissed the royal ambassadors with pretences and false promises of his coming. At the same time he sent a messenger to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, asking him how long he was going to wander about in the hills and deserts, and telling him to come quickly in his own direction so that they might act in concert. By chance Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, who was going to Qandah\u0101r in His Majesty\u2019s service, arrived at Ghaznin. H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad, who was longing for the Kh\u0101n (b\u0101 kh\u0101n taw\u0101q\u0101n b\u016bd), went out to meet him and fawned upon him, seeking to bring him into the fort under the pretext of a feast and to shut him up there. The Kh\u0101n proceeded towards the fort when Mir Habash, who was with H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, gave a signal to the Kh\u0101n, and he, being put on his guard, thereby made an excuse and renounced his intention of entering the fort, and encamped at a fountain outside the city. There he soothed H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad and prevailed upon him to accompany him to K\u0101bul. He sent the news of his own arrival and of the bringing of H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad; and His Majesty, having heard that M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was coming to the territory of K\u0101bul, proceeded to K\u0101bul with all haste. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n advanced to within one stage of K\u0101bul and then, when he heard of the arrival of the Kh\u0101nkh\u0101n\u0101n and of his having H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n with him, he again withdrew in confusion to Lamgh\u0101n. One day H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad wished to enter K\u0101bul by the Iron Gate, but Khw. Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mahm\u016bd, who was in charge of K\u0101bul, would not permit him to enter the fort and sent him a harsh message. That face-blackened one became suspicious and went off to Qar\u0101 B\u0101gh, under pretext of hunting; and then, passing by the Kutal-i-min\u0101r went to B\u0101b\u0101 Qucq\u0101r (i.e., B\u0101b\u0101 ram); then by the D\u0101man-i-k\u014dh of Bihz\u0101d\u012b and Lalandar,1 went quickly off to Ghaznin. Just then the victorious standards of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, who had gone towards K\u0101bul to quell the disturbance of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, arrived at Si\u0101h Sang. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n was exalted by paying homage. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b ordered that no one should enter the city, for he was going in pursuit of the Mirza, so that he might, once for all, free God\u2019s creatures from daily disturbance. But as his mind was not at ease about H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad, the officers were unanimous that he should be secured about him and\n\n---\n\n1 Bilandari. Erskine reads Alindar. I adopt the variant Lalandar, which is supported by B.M. MSS. and by Jarrett II. 404.\nthen set out after the Mirz\u0101. His Majesty came to the city and appointed Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n to look after H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad and instructed him to act with dissimulation and by every contrivance possible to bring him in.\n\nBair\u0101m Kh\u0101n tamed H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad by suitable devices and after promises and oaths, he came to the village of Gulk\u0101r\u00b9 and embraced the Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n. The latter brought him to the presence of the forgiving prince and begged for the remission of his offences.\n\nFour or five days later they all went together towards the Lamgh\u0101n\u0101t which was the retreat of the Mirz\u0101. In spite of the recent forgiveness of so many crimes, H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad acted as if he had never committed them, and again had the audacity to enter on still worse schemes. He shewed disgraceful conduct and disgusted the holy heart. His Majesty went off with a large body of men, and when the standards of fortune reached Jal\u0101lab\u0101d, the Mirz\u0101 retreated to the defiles of Kan\u016br and N\u016brgal, and all sedition-mongers crept away. The Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n was appointed to follow the Mirz\u0101, and the latter, not being able to maintain himself in Kan\u016br\u00b2 and N\u016brgal went off to the Indus (Nil\u0101b). The Kh\u0101nkhan\u0101n returned and did homage in Daka.\u00b3\n\nAt this time His Majesty took into consideration general utility and the public tranquillity, and ordered the arrest of H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad and his brother, Sh\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad\u2014who was capable of being H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s instructor in wickedness. And these two ungrateful brothers\u2014who in their service looked to nothing but material advantages and their own credit; who were given over to cupidity and ingratitude; who looked for a great price in exchange for their inferior goods, and who were unmindful of benefits, were caught by their own wickedness. His Majesty, in accordance with his just nature, ordered that the services which the low-thoughted service-sellers had voluntarily or involuntarily rendered during their careers, should be entered by them in a list, and that one of the honest servants should write out their offences, so that by putting them into the balance of justice, the real facts about these two evil-doers\n\n\u00b9 Gulkina, a suburb of K\u0101bul.

The record\\(^1\\) of their good deeds remained unwritten, while their sins came to 102 great culpabilities,\u2014each one of which might have been a ground of imprisonment and death and degradation. Good God! there is one man who after good service is trembling and downcast, lest his (Akbar's) glance fall upon his work and there be a suspicion that he, a simple-minded man, is selling his services, or that he is ill-conditioned. And the more honest his service, the greater his apprehensions! And there is another kind of man who sells things not done at the rate of things done; who passes off bad deeds as good ones; who after tricking out his blemishes,\\(^2\\) looks for favours, and indulges himself in self-commendation.\n\nWhen by this thorough investigation it was proved to the world that these two disloyalists deserved the punishment of their own wickedness, and that it was time the skirt of the age should be cleansed from the dirt of their existence, their fierce and brutish natures\u2014which infected them in the cage of the raw material of humanity,\u2014were drawn forth by a halter from human shape, and consigned to a fitting place, and they, or rather the world, was granted deliverance from their hideous nature. Ghazn\u012bn was assigned to Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n and his (H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad's) other fiefs were distributed among the (royal) servants.\n\nThe winter was spent in that neighbourhood, in travelling and hunting, and in feasting and rejoicing. In the beginning of spring, when the humours are in a state of equilibrium, general receptions were held, and after petitions and tendering of gifts, a number were enrolled in service. The dust of the M\u012brz\u0101's strife and disturbance was laid, and His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b went by B\u0101dpaj to the river B\u0101r\u0101n. On the night that the army was near B\u0101dpaj, there was much rain and snow and many suffered. When hunting and sight-seeing were ended, K\u0101bul was made the seat of dominion, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Jauhar, Stewart 107.

Khw. Gh\u0101zi was sent with him to convey presents and to go on an embassy to the ruler of Persia. Ghaznin, Gardish, Bangash and the t\u016bm\u0101n of Lah\u016bgar (Logar) were bestowed on M. Hind\u0101l. Qund\u016bz, which belonged to the Mirz\u0101, was conferred on M\u012br Barka and M. \u1e24asan. M. Hind\u0101l was granted leave to go to Ghaznin and M\u012br Barka received permission to go to Qund\u016bz. J\u016bi Sh\u0101hi and its territory were assigned to Khi\u1e63r Khw. Kh\u0101n. Before M\u012br Barka reached Qund\u016bz, M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm got possession of it by trickery from Mu\u1e25ammad T\u0101hir Kh\u0101n, and M\u012br Barka returned to K\u0101bul. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b allowed the good services of the Mirz\u0101 to be an atonement for his action and left him in possession of Qund\u016bz.

HIND\u0100L.\n\nM. K\u0101mr\u0101n spent some days in the cell of contempt and disgrace, and then hearts which had been set at rest, were again agitated by the news of his strife-mongering; and wayfarers reported to His Majesty that he had come back from the Indus (Nil\u0101b) and had again raised the head of sedition in the district of J\u016bi Shah\u012b, in concert with a band of vagabonds. His Majesty summoned M. Hind\u0101l from Ghazn\u012bn and issued marching-orders to the neighbouring j\u0101gird\u0101rs. In a short time M. Hind\u0101l did homage, and the devoted and dutiful followers gathered round. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni ordered an expedition to extinguish the flames of sedition, and M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, on hearing of this, retreated unsuccessful. When the victorious standards had neared Surkh\u0101b, \u1e24aidar Mu\u1e25ammad Akht\u0101beg\u012b, who was in the advance-guard, had, with many devoted men, gone ahead of the royal camp and halted on the banks of the Si\u0101h \u0100b, which is between the Surkh\u0101b and Gandamak. M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, who did not find himself able to engage in a pitched battle, made a night attack on him. \u1e24aidar Mu\u1e25ammad showed lion-like courage and made a gallant fight, and received conspicuous wounds, which are in appearance and in reality red-lettered diplomas (tughr\u0101). He remained firm and did not give up his ground. Though many things were plundered, the Mirz\u0101 failed and had to return disconcerted. After some days when the village of Japri\u0101r, which belongs to the t\u016bm\u0101n of Neknah\u0101r,1 had been made the camping ground,\u2014inasmuch\n\n---\n\n1 Or N\u0113knihal, Jarrett II. 405.

Bay\u0101zid speaks of Car-y\u0101r and Hind\u0101lp\u0101r; and Raverty, (Notes on Afghanistan, 55) says Jiry\u0101r or Jab\u012bry\u0101r belongs to Nangnahar and is also written Jab\u012brh\u0101r and lies on the slopes of the Spinghar Range.\nas vigilance and caution are the components of alertness,\u2014batteries were arranged and a trench and bulwark made. At the end of the day two Afgh\u0101ns brought word that M. K\u0101mr\u0101n intended that night to make an attack with a large body of Afgh\u0101ns. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b brought the rules of circumspection to bear and stationed men at every point. On the night of Sunday, 21st Z\u012bl-q\u0101d\u0101, 958 (20th November, 1551), when a quarter of the night had passed away, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n fell upon the camp with a large body of Afgh\u0101ns. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b mounted his horse and stood on a height behind his tent, and summoned to his presence the glory of foreheads and the great pearl of the diadem of the Khil\u0101fat, to wit, His Majesty the Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h. The servants of the exalted threshold were all in the entrenchments and doing their duty bravely. The flames of battle were blazing. In the midst of this tumult and confusion \u2018Abdu-l-wahh\u0101b yas\u0101wal, who was in the entrenchments, was struck by a bullet and became a martyr. The market of conflict grew hot until the shining moon,\u2014which is the mirror-holder of the world,\u2014raised her head from the quarter of fortune and brightened the earth with her effulgence. The light of victory radiated from the brows of dominion, and the adversary sought safety in flight. The imperialists were victorious and raised the standards of composure. The hearts of all had become tranquil when suddenly an unpleasant report came to the royal hearing, that M. Hind\u0101l had left this evil world. Joy became bitter and exaltation was changed into abundance of sorrow. Alas! 'tis the way of this transitory world that if a breath go forth in joy, next moment the smoke of grief ascends from the breast of the afflicted.\n\nVerse.\n\nNever is heaven\u2019s eye brightened by the morning,\nWithout the evening twilight\u2019s suffusing it with blood.\n\nThere is neither capability of dallying for enjoyment therein, nor permission for persistent grief. Though the M\u012brz\u0101 left this unstable world and departed from this unenduring hostel, he gained the glory of martyrdom and at once acquired a good name in the visible world and an exalted rank in the world of reality. Hail! O Thou little-receiving and much-giving who, on the departure of borrowed life, hast given such permanent grandeur! His Majesty\nwho was a mine of gratitude, was so affected and sorrowful at the death of so noble a brother that his feelings cannot be described or hinted at. But as he was wise and far-seeing, he turned from lamentation to resignation and sought comfort in the pleasant abode of submission to the Divine Will.\n\nThe account of this melancholy affair is as follows. When M. Hindal heard of the projected night attack he put the entrenchments in order, and he had gone to take some repose, when the noise of the Afghans arose. An undescribable number of Afghans came into each battery, and many entered the Mirza's. The night was dark. The Mirza addressed himself to the repulsing of the wretches, while his own men were confused and hastened to look after their horses. Meanwhile the Mirza came face to face with the Afghans. Nur'm Koka and many others behaved badly. The time for using bow and arrow passed and he grappled with one of the foe, and by main force overthrew the born villain. The brother of that wretch, Jaranda by name and belonging to the Mahmand tribe, sent the Mirza to the other world by a poison-stained spear. Some of M. Kamran's companions used to relate that that evil-natured Afghan got hold of a case which contained the Mirza's special thumb-stalls and brought it before M. Kamran, not knowing with whom he had played this disastrous game. He described the occurrence. When the Mirza's eye fell on the thumb-stall case, he knew what misfortune had happened and flung his turban on the ground, saying that M. Hindal had been martyred.\n\nIn short the soul of the Mirza travelled on that dark night to the abode of annihilation without its being known, and his body remained where it fell. Meanwhile some of his servants were coming back, when Khw. Ibrah\u00eem Badakhshi observed that there was a black cuirass (galmag) on the body. As it was dark and the tumult still continued, he did not approach it. Then it occurred to him that M. Hindal had been wearing a black cuirass. He turned round and looked at it and recognised the Mirza. In accordance\n\n1 Gulbadan's account is that none of them dismounted.\n2 This name seems to mean my right and to be formed like Maham, my moon. He was foster-brother of M. Ibrah\u00eem, Akbar's half-brother, Bloch. man 526.\n3 The Iqbalnama has Farid.\nwith patience and deliberation which are the watchwords of the wise, he carried off the body to the Mirz\u0101's tent and made it over to the doorkeepers; and he wisely took steps to conceal the melancholy occurrence so that the enemy might not rejoice nor be encouraged, and also that the imperial servants might not be disheartened. He reported that the Mirz\u0101 was much fatigued, and was also slightly wounded, and that no one should make any noise or tumult close by. He himself went up on the rising ground and conveyed congratulations on the victory as from the Mirz\u0101. The illuminated soul of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b received a ray of intelligence from this statement. In fine the Mirz\u0101's bier was deposited in J\u016bi Sh\u0101h\u012b, and after some time was brought to K\u0101bul. The body was placed in the Guzarg\u0101h, near the holy tomb of His Majesty Geti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b, and buried at his feet. Mull\u0101 Khurd Zargar who was in the Mirz\u0101's service, composed an elegy of which the first couplet was,\u2014  \n\nVerse.\n\nOne night sorrow made a night-attack on the apple of mine eye,  \nOwing to the onset of blood, my beloved departed.\n\n---\n\n1 Gulbadan says M\u012br B\u0101b\u0101 D\u014dst carried in the body.\n2 From a previous reference (Text I. 275) it appears that Mull\u0101 Khurd was in K\u0101mr\u0101n's service, so that the word Mirz\u0101 here probably refers to K\u0101mr\u0101n. He is mentioned in the Tabag\u0101l-i-akbar\u012b, Lucknow Ed., p.405, under the name of Mull\u0101 Khurd Zargar. His poetical name was Fan\u0101l and Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn says he was originally a servant of M. 'Askari. See also Blochmann 426, but perhaps this is a different Fan\u0101l.\n3 Lit. One night the blood of the liver made an attack on my eye-pupil. Owing to the coming and going of blood the black-eyed one pitched his tent outside.\n\nThe text has sip\u0101h-dida and this may be correct, the meaning being the sentinel, or the soldier-eye. But there is the variant si\u0101h dida meaning black-eyed, and a mistress; and this reading I adopt. Probably the poet wanted to take advantage of both readings for sip\u0101h agrees with the expression \"pitched his tent outside. Possibly he had in his mind the passage in B\u0101ber's Memoirs, (Leyden and Erskine, p. 33), where we are told that Baisanghar had to shift his pavilion three times on account of the number of executions that took place in front of it. The quatrain which follows is said by A.F. to be also by Mull\u0101 Khurd, but Bad\u0101oni (I. 454) gives it as the composition of Maul\u0101n\u0101 Hasan 'Al\u012b\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nThis chronogram is also his,\u2014\nVerse.\nHind\u0101l Muhammad, a king of glorious title,\nSuddenly, in the dead of night, became a martyr,\nAs a night-attack (shabkh\u016bn) caused his martyrdom,\nSeek the chronogram from shabkh\u016bn\u00b9 (958).\n\nM\u012br Am\u0101n\u012b uttered this enigmatical chronogram,\u2014\nVerse.\u00b2\nA cypress left the garden of glory.\nThe Mirz\u0101 was born in 924\u00b3 (1518) and so it was said:\u2014\n\nVerse.\nThe chronogram was kaukab-i-burj-i-sh\u0101hansh\u0101hi (924),\n(the kaukab of the king of kings\u2019 tower).\n\nNext day His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b went from there to Bihs\u016bd,\nwhere he encamped in order that he might, once for all, set his\nworld-adorning heart at rest with respect to the strife of the sedi-\ntious and then make K\u0101bul, by the glory of his sublime court, an\nabode of peace and tranquillity.\n\nKhar\u0101s.

Kaukab means both a\nstar, and a golden ball, and burj\nmeans both a tower and a sign of the\nZodiac. The Memoirs of Gulbadan\nBegam also go to show that Hind\u0101l\nwho was her full brother, was born\nin 925.\nCHAPTER LII.\n\n315 Assignment of the Territory of Ghaznin to His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h, and Elevation of Some to his Service.\n\nAs, from his early years, the notes of greatness and the glory of government shone from the lustrous brows of that new fruit of the tree of sovereignty and that splendour and nosegay of the garden of the khil\u0101fat and fortune,\u2014to wit, His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h,\u2014at this time, when he was ten years old, all the servants of M. Hind\u0101l, together with all his J\u0101g\u012brs, viz., Ghaznin, etc., were assigned to him, so that, by the practice of rule, he might exhibit favour and severity in the management of men; and by administration of a part, he might become accustomed to administer the whole. One of the wonderful things of fate was that some days earlier, the turban of this light of the eyes of dominion came off in a crowd when he was riding in the service of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. M. Hind\u0101l was there and from perfect reverence, he took off his own fortunate cap (t\u0101j) in the midst of that crowd and placed it on the star-brushing head (i.e., of Akbar). The far-seeing drew the omen from this that the time when the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h would wear the diadem and wield authority, was nigh at hand. The Almighty, in recompense for this deed, elevated the M\u012brz\u0101 to the rank of martyrdom which is equivalent to life and joy eternal. His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h\u2014who is the Divine nursling,\u2014shewed such marks of greatness, graciousness and appreciation of men, in winning hearts, that grief for the M\u012brz\u0101 left men\u2019s souls and they became possessed of constant joy.\n\nVerse.\n\nO God! so long as the world hath lustre and colour,\nThe heavens gyration and the earth stability;\nGrant him enjoyment of life and youth;\nAbove all, give him abundance of existence.\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nThe names of the principal servants of the deceased M\u012brz\u0101 who entered into the service of the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, are as follows:\u2014(1). Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n; (2). N\u0101\u1e63ir Qul\u012b; (3). Khw. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm; (4). Maul\u0101n\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h; (5). \u0100d\u012bna Tuqb\u0101\u012b; (6).

Maul\u0101n\u0101 \u0160\u0101n\u012b, now known as \u0160\u0101n\u012b Kh\u0101n;\u00b9 (12). Maul\u0101n\u0101 B\u0101b\u0101 Dost\u00b2 \u1e63adr, who was highly regarded by the M\u012brz\u0101; (13). M\u012br Jam\u0101l\u00b3 who was also a favourite with the M\u012brz\u0101; (14). Khald\u012bn D\u014dst Sah\u0101ri. B\u0101b\u0101 D\u014dst was also a servant of the M\u012brz\u0101 but, as in the educational canon, nothing is worse than bad company, he, on account of his bad character was not taken on. Though Mu\u1e25ammad T\u0101hir Kh\u0101n was an old servant of the M\u012brz\u0101, yet, inasmuch as he had not been able to keep charge of Qund\u016bz,\u2074 he was excluded from the glance of the truth-discerning eye, and was not made a companion on this auspicious expedition. As the Court of this bestower of glory on the earth, was a test of the jewel of humanity, the condition of every one of these men who was of good disposition and pure character, became better day by day, and they attained lofty positions. And it is to be hoped that they will remain to the end in that condition. Everyone who was evil had the veil stripped from his acts and was so dealt with as to be a warning to all who were evil or negligent.\n\nAs the village of Bihs\u016bd became the camp of the pavilions of fortune, an order was given to build a strong fort. His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h was sent off\u2075 in order to strengthen the city of K\u0101bul and that he might there practise the methods of spiritual and temporal sovereignty. His Majesty himself remained at Bihs\u016bd under the Divine aid and exercised vigilance with regard to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n. The army remained there for four or five months. The M\u012brz\u0101, from want of sense, (az b\u012b ist\u012b\u1e6d\u0101\u2018a\u2019ll) was each day the guest of a clan and each night took refuge with a landholder.

Perhaps he was also known as \u2018Ali Akbar and perhaps Bad\u0161\u014dn\u012b was mistaken in giving this as another name of \u0160\u0101n\u012b Kh\u0101n.\n\u00b3 Probably this was the brother of B\u0101bar\u2019s Afgh\u0101n wife, Bibi Mub\u0101rika.\n\u2074 A reference to his allowing himself to be over-reached by M. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm.\n\u2075 Hum\u0101y\u016bn seems to have forgotten his vow never again to be separated from Akbar.\nnature, he remained veiled in self-conceit and excluded from the auspicious service and fellowship of such a benefactor, and was for ever indulging in seditious thoughts.\n\nAt this time, a set of superficialists who were in the service of His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h and were oblivious of an internal abode of wisdom, wrote to His Majesty Jah\u0101nt\u0101n\u012b and complained about his Highness. His Majesty, notwithstanding that he was aware of the inner light of the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, had regard to externals, and sent a gracious letter containing instructions and admonitions, full of kindness and paternal affection and not at all of a censuring or cautioning character. For what need has he who has been taught at the Divine school,\u2014of human instructions? or what concern has the nursling of Heaven with such didactics? In that letter this verse of Shaikh Niz\u0101m\u012b was quoted.\n\nVerse.\n\nSit not idle, 'tis not the time for play:\n'Tis the time for arts and for work.\n\nHe was first taken before Mull\u0101z\u0101da Mull\u0101 \u2018A\u1e63\u0101mu-d-din to be taught. As this teacher was devoted to pigeons, the servants reported against him. His Majesty discharged him and made over the duty of outward instruction to Maul\u0101n\u0101 B\u0101yazid. He performed this duty, but as the world-adorning Deity did not wish that His own special pupil should become tainted by exotic sciences, He diverted him from such pursuits and made him inattentive to them. The shallow thought it was the fault of the teachers and reported against them, but as the latter were right-thinking and of good character, the complaints were not accepted or acted upon. At last His Majesty had an inspiration, to wit, that for the purpose of instructing that pupil of the Divine school, lots should be cast between Mull\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-Q\u0101dir, Mull\u0101z\u0101da Mull\u0101 \u2018A\u1e63\u0101mu-d-din, and Maul\u0101n\u0101 B\u0101yazid, so that he, on whom the lucky chance should fall, should be exalted by being made the sole teacher. It happened that the lot fell on Maul\u0101n\u0101 Abdu-l-Q\u0101dir, and an order issued for the removal of Maul\u0101n\u0101 B\u0101yazid and the appointment of Maul\u0101n\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-Q\u0101dir.\n\nIt is not hidden from the wise and acute that the appointment of a teacher in a case like this, springs from use and wont, and does\nnot pertain to the acquisition of perfections. For him who is God's pupil, what occasion is there for teaching by creatures, or for application to lessons? Accordingly his holy heart and his sacred soul never turned towards external teaching. And his possession of the most excellent sciences together with his disinclination for the learning of letters were a method of showing to mankind, at the time of the manifestation of the lights of hidden abundancies, that the lofty comprehension of this Lord of the Age was not learnt or acquired, but was the gift of God in which human effort had no part. His Highness in that period assimilated external glory and temporal dominion in abundance, but feigned ignorance of inward perfections and spent much time in sport, and practised wisdom under a veil of concealment, so that even the farseeing failed to notice it. But, as his genius was soaring, he was making a perfect veil for himself out of grand external performances. And he put his heart into acts so that though their beauty was not evident to the superficial yet the profound perceived the designs. Among them was his continually giving his attention to that wondrous creature the camel and his delight in the marvels of Divine power. He used to observe and contemplate the strange make and ways of camels, which were the biggest animals in that region and, under the guise of amusement and metaphor, made serious reflections on the darw\u0101n-like constitution of those beasts\u2014their endurance and patience; submission and resignation, their passive obedience even should the leading cord be in the hand of a child,\u2014their being satisfied to eat thorns, and their endurance of thirst. He also applied his thoughts to the delight in an Arab horse which is a grand subject of dominion and exaltation, and carried off the hall of excellencies and of philosophy (kun\u0101rpard\u0101s\u012b, love of science) with the polo-stick of the Divine help and of sempiternal instruction. And sometimes he opened the wings of his genius in the spacious atmosphere of meditation upon God and brought his contemplative mind to study the sport of pigeon-flying. He scattered grain in order to allure their timid breasts and proceeded from the superficial joy and\n\n1 The text omits the negative, but the variant nam\u0101fi\u1e63 makes better sense and is supported by two H.M.

Blochmann 298.\necstasy of these handfuls of wings and feathers to the recuperative and visible raptures of the lords of perfection, and thereby participated in the joys of the spiritual world. He carried his heart from the flying of these aerial fliers to the lofty soaring of the swift-winged ones of holy heaven, and under the guise of sport performed the work of adoration. Sometimes he would apply himself to coursing with dogs and thus occupy himself with sensuous things. Outwardly it was cynegetics, inwardly it was quickening the senses. Apparently his heart was fixed upon dog-fancying, in reality he was conducting his companions in the methods of government. And although he was pursuing his quests under the veil of irrecognition and kept himself attired in the garb of superficialists, he could not hide his sweet savour or his brilliancy. Divine glory ever shone from his lustrous brows, and the attributes of spiritual and temporal leadership were conspicuous in the irradiated countenance of that elect of God!\n\nOne day he was engaged in hunting on the slope of the Safid Sang hills and had put hunting-dogs into the charge of his immediate attendants in order that they should lie in wait. And certain men\n\n1 Cf. the remarks about hunting, Blochmann 282.\n\n2 There is a Safid Sang south of K\u0101bul, but probably what is meant is the Safid Koh or Spingh\u0101r range S.W. of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d.\n\n3 Ke t\u016bsq\u0101wal b\u0101sh\u012bnd. The word t\u016bsq\u0101wal is not in the dictionaries. It occurs once before, viz., at Text, p. 255, l. 11. That passage is founded on Bay\u0101z\u012bd I.O. MS., 286 and he says that t\u016bsq\u0101wal is called nihilam in Badakhsh\u0101n. Now B\u0101bar has the word nihilam, p. 28 of Memoirs, and speaks of his uncle Sultan Mahm\u016bd M\u012brz\u0101's being very fond of hunting the nihilam. That is, this is how Leyden has understood the passage, and P. de Courteille has followed him. But it would appear from the passage before us that tasq\u0101wal according to A.F. means a particular kind of hunting and is not the name of any animal. Apparently it refers to the practice of driving game past a shelter or shooting box. The Lucknow edition of the Akbarn\u0101ma says in a note to the passage, at p. 238 that tasq\u0101wal is a Turki word and means a hunter who remains on the low ground in ambush. It may perhaps be connected with the Turqi qar\u0101wal a hunter, or it may be Arabic and a derivative from q\u0101w\u0101l and q\u0101w\u0101l and mean one who feigns inactivity. B\u0101bar's remark that his uncle took to the pursuit in the latter part of his life seems to imply that the sport was not of an active kind. In the Persian of B\u0101bar's Mem., as given in the Bombay lithographed edition, nihilam appears as bahilam.\n\nSince writing this note I have\nhad been sent up the mountain to drive the deer down into the plain. When the deer came to the obstacles, the servants had been caught by the dog of carnal appetite, and as in their folly they thought only of His Highness's tender years and boyish appearance, they had set themselves to eat and so did not slip the dogs in time. When he became aware of this, his inward sovereignty was aroused, and he issued an order that their necks should be bound with cords as if they were dogs, and they be led round the camp. He so sat on the masnad of severity that the old and experienced were amazed and placed the finger of surprise in their mouths. When this occurrence came to the ears of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, his heart was greatly delighted and he remarked that he would soon come to great sovereignty and attain everlasting dominion.\n\nSh\u0101ham Kh\u0101n Jal\u016br used to tell how one day His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b bade him go and see what the new fruit of fortune's springtide was doing. \"When I went,\" he said, \"I found him lying down. His lustrous countenance was serene and he looked as if he were asleep. In truth he was holding converse with the holy ones of heaven's court (the angels). His blessed hand moved occasionally as is seen in the recuperative states of the lords of contemplation. From time to time there fell from his pearl-dropping tongue such expressions as \"God willing, I'll bring the cream of earth's surface under my sway and fulfil the desires of the sorrowful of the seven climes.\" \"The Kh\u0101n used to say that when he saw this condition and heard these words, he became amazed, and great awe fell upon him, so that he could not stand. He went aside and remained stupefied. Several times did he (Akbar) speak in this fashion.\n\nA laudable behaviour of His Highness at this time and one which showed his lofty and farseeing nature was that whenever any flatterers or black-hearted persons, who see nothing but their own personal loss or gain, or rather think their loss is their gain, would\n\nfound the word *t\u016bsq\u0101wal* \u062a\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0644 in the Turkish-Persian dictionary of M\u012brz\u0101 'Al\u012b Bakht, and which is known as the Farhang Azaf\u0101ri. This dictionary is in the Mull\u0101 F\u012bruz Library, Bombay, and is No. 27, p. 54 of Rehatsekh's catalogue. It explains *t\u016bsq\u0101wal* as the shutting up of a road.\n\n*Tasq\u0101wal*, or *nihilam* then was a kind of hunting analogous to \"driving\" and was perhaps such a sport as Akbar is said to have engaged in at the Deer-tower of Fatehpur Sikri.\n\n1 Perhaps it should be *z\u012b\u0101n-i-digar* the loss of others, but all the MSS. seem to have *Khud*.\nsay \"May you soon be king of the seven climes\" or \"May you be the Lord of the Age\" he would be much displeased and say \"Those people in their little sense want to show themselves wellwishers. God forbid that they know anything of the palace of wellwishing! They are imagining evil for me in thinking of the decease of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, and are gathering my temporal good from my spiritual ill. Or rather they are casting trouble into the country of welfare and raising the head of sedition. For the spiritual and temporal good fortune of children lies in their hopes and wishes being always for the preservation of their august fathers, and they wish them long life. For he who does not act rightly by his temporal God how shall he conduct himself properly towards his spiritual God?\" Let men admire the lofty understanding, the pure nature, and the right thinking of this spiritually and temporally great one (Akbar)! In fine, greatness and glory shone in every action of His Highness. What the mature and experienced attained to by thought and care, this cherished one of God's glance acquired with small application in the beginning of his career. And every knowledge and science that the learned and the studious gathered with difficulty, came into the hands of this exhibitor of wondrous powers without meditation or care. Ripe wisdom made the hope-eye of the world shine on beholding this light of the eyes of sovereignty, and made men exult in the firm wisdom and deep knowledge of this nursling of God. But till the time of the revelation of the Khil\u0101fat, it was veiled and hidden, and he passed his time under God's protection and free from the mischief of the deceit and treachery of ill-wishers.\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nExpedition of His Majesty Jah\u0101nban\u012b Jannat-ashy\u0101n\u012b from Bih\u0101\u016bd against the Afghan clans,\u2014amongst whom was the ambush of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n's strifes,\u2014and flight of the latter to India.\n\nWhen winter came to an end in the village of Bih\u0101\u016bd and the violence of the cold was over; and when it was known that M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, with a few retainers, was spending his days amongst the Afghan clans, most of the officers were of opinion that, as the Mirz\u0101 had now no power of opposition, His Majesty should leave there a body of troops, and should proceed to Kabul. But a party of the far-seeing represented that as the weather was now temperate, it was advisable to attack and plunder the Afgh\u0101ns; and that it was improper to return until this faction,\u2014the material of strife and sedition,\u2014had been thoroughly subdued. Thus both M. K\u0101mr\u0101n who was secretly living amongst the tribe and who was making ready the constituents of dissension, would fall into their hands, and also, the root of the disturbers would be dug up.\n\nHis Majesty Jah\u0101nban\u012b preferred this view, and guided by victory, mounted the steed of fortune in order to fall suddenly upon the clans and pour the dust of defeat on their heads. A number of impetuous heroes and wielders of the sword, such as Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Jal\u0101l\u012br, Sh. Mu\u1e25ammad Faw\u0101q, Shaikh Bahi\u016bl, \u1e20\u0101sh Quli N\u0101ranji, were appointed under the leadership of Sh. \u1e24usain Kh\u0101n to go forward in advance. The wind was very cold that night and the way was long, so they halted mid-way to ease their men and cattle. In the morning, they mounted and went on.\n\nAs the tribes had scattered here and there, it was not known in which the Mirz\u0101 was. In this time of perplexity, Maham \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n and B\u0101b\u0101 Khiz\u0101r\u012b who were on the way from M. K\u0101mr\u0101n to Malik Mu\u1e25ammad of Mandraur, fell into the hands of the royal servants. They asked in which tribe the Mirz\u0101 was. Maham \u2018Ali\nled the inquirers astray and indicated a tribe other than that in which the Mirz\u0101 was. B\u0101b\u0101 said, \u201cHe is frightened, he does not know what he is saying. The Mirz\u0101 is in such and such an encampment and I will show the way.\u201d The advance-guard reached the place at early dawn, attacked it, sent many to the abode of annihilation and captured a number of women and children. Some of the heroes entered the tent where the Mirz\u0101 was sleeping, and Sh\u0101h Quli N\u0101ranj\u012b declares that he was one of them and that there were two persons within. One of them was caught and the other contrived to escape. In the morning, it was seen that the captive was Beg Mul\u016bk whom the Mirz\u0101 always kept in his sight, and that it was the Mirz\u0101 who had gone out. Some of the vagabond Afgh\u0101ns, such as Shaikh Y\u016bsuf Karar\u0101n\u012b and Malik Sang\u012b, stood up to fight and then flung the dust of disgrace on themselves by running away. Their goods fell into the hands of the royal servants. The victory was won before the arrival of the royal standards. The Mirz\u0101 was not able to remain in those parts and went to India.\n\nWhen His Majesty\u2019s heart was freed from the business of chastising the rebellious and when, by God\u2019s favour, a great victory had been gained,\u2014such as might be a preface to victories,\u2014he left the district and returned to Bih\u015b\u016bd. When it was ascertained that the Mirz\u0101 had escaped, under circumstances befitting thankless ingrates, and had gone to India, His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b went to the B\u0101gh-i-saf\u0101\u00b9 which is the delight of hearts and may be styled a cleanser (\u1e63af\u0101-bakhsh) of the picture-gallery of the soul, and there made a festival with pomp and splendour.\n\nAs the days were lengthening and there was the beginning of the splendour of spring and of the freshness of avenues (kh\u012by\u0101b\u0101n) and of the delights of the heart opening streams, he sent a number of special individuals under charge of \u2018Ali Quli of Andar\u0101b to K\u0101bul to fetch that spring-blossom, His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, together with the chaste ladies; so that he might, by beholding the wonders of early spring and by reading the pages of the rose-garden, gain\n\n\u00b9 The B\u0101gh-i-saf\u0101 was at C\u0101r B\u0101gh which is marked in maps as W. of Jal\u0101l\u0101b\u0101d and higher up the K\u0101bul river. See Raverty, \u201cNotes on Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n,\u201d p. 53, and Jarrett II. 405. The B\u0101gh-i-saf\u0101 is distinct from the B\u0101gh-i-waf\u0101\u2019.\nadmittance to the enclosure of recognition of the Divine artist and might lay the foundations of thanksgiving.\n\nTheir Highnesses arrived in a short time, and His Majesty gave endless thanksgiving gifts, which are a means of attracting yet more favours from the true Benefactor. After a time of enjoyment, he proceeded in an auspicious hour, to K\u0101bul.\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nHIS MAJESTY THE SH\u0100HINSH\u0100H GOES TO GHAZN\u012aN, AND EXALTATION OF THAT PLACE BY HIS DWELLING THERE.\n\nAs His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b perceived that the splendours of guidance and of capacity for affairs of His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h were increasing daily, he determined, now that things were quieted, to separate him for a few days from his person in order that his greatness might be tested, that all might know his abilities, and also that he might have practice in the art of rule. For whoever in his youthful years, and also when by himself, shall make prudence his guide, and show magnanimity in all his ways, and who shall, without pluming himself on his own grandeur, exercise justice and equity to the humble and needy, and he whom real union (with his parent or guardian) shall suffice and whom physical remoteness shall not make sad,\u2014assuredly he it is who can become the Unique Pearl of the Khil\u0101fat. As the glories of such qualities were believed to be, or rather were known with certainty to be, written on the tablet-forehead of His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h, he was sent to Ghazn\u012bn in the beginning of 959, (end of December, 1551). The Atka Kh\u0101n, Khw. Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Ma\u1e25m\u016bd and all the servants of M. Hind\u0101l were attached to him in this happy enterprise, the general management being with the Khw\u0101ja aforesaid. He spent six months there in vigilance and prosperity, and as spiritual and temporal supremacy was ever visible in him, right actions and laudable manners, such as are not seen in mature and experienced men, displayed themselves in this fortunate and happy-starred youth. And he was continually winning hearts by his right ways and his worship of the right. He always strove to comfort the distracted. He was always bent upon pleasing that class of men who expend themselves in the domain of privation and who, having girt up the loins of effort for the purification of manners and the knowledge of God, have taken the path of poverty and renunciation, turning aside from ease and sorrow, and\nthe praise and blame of worldlings, and concerning themselves solely with the Unique and Companionless One (God).\n\nAt that time there was in Ghaznin B\u0101b\u0101 Bil\u0101s\u00b9 who was one of the enthusiastic God-knowers and immersed in the sea of contemplation and who spent his days in the cell and the hermitage of obscurity. His Highness frequently went to see him. And that seer of the workshop of holiness read temporal and spiritual supremacy in the lines of his forehead and congratulated him on his external and internal kingship, and gave him the good news of long life, and lofty distinctions. When it was near the time that he should obtain respite from the hunting and travelling in Ghaznin he, in accordance with an indication from His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b, set about his return. The reason of his recall was that His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was ever engaged in business in K\u0101bul. All his time was divided and apportioned, and not a moment of night or day was spent in frivolities or idleness. But together with his dispensing of justice, and comforting the brokenhearted and surveying the work of the kingdom, he took pleasure in travel and field-sports. One day he had gone riding to Zama\u00b2 which is one of the delightful villages of K\u0101bul, and had accidentally fallen from his horse, and sustained bodily injuries. As prudence is closely associated with dominion, he, out of precaution and reflection on the end of things, sent a letter recalling His Majesty Sh\u0101hansh\u0101h. By the happy influence of his advent His Majesty attained a perfect recovery.\n\n\u00b9 A variant gives Pal\u0101s and this is the form used by Rayz\u012bd. He tells how Hum\u0101yn unsuccessfully tried to evade the saint when he visited Ghaznin on his way to Qandah\u0101r; and how the saint questioned him about his having put H\u0101j\u012b Mu\u1e25ammad to death, Erskine M.S. trs. p. 40.\n\n\u00b2 Called Zamzama at p. 260 last line. It lay N. of K\u0101bul.\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nEXPEDITION OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100NI JANNA\u1e6c-\u0100GHY\u0100NI TO BANGASH,\nAND CHASTISMENT OF THE REBELLIOUS; RAISING THE STANDARD OF\nINTENTION FOR INDIA; CAPTURE OF M. K\u0100MR\u0100N, AND\nRETURN TO K\u0100BUL, ETC.\n\nIn the winter of the end of 959 (November, 1552), His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni determined upon proceeding to Bangash which is a winter-quarters for K\u0101bul. The design of this expedition was both to chastise the rebels of that quarter, and also to recruit his army. For the sake of auspiciousness, he took with him His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, as being closely connected with his good fortune, and proceeded towards Gardiz and Bangash. The Afgh\u0101ns received proper punishment, and their goods fell into the hands of the soldiery. The first tribe attacked was the 'Abdu-r-rahm\u0101ni,' the last was the Barmazid. Fath Sh\u0101h Afgh\u0101n,\u2014who in his folly and unwisdom thought himself wise and led others astray,\u2014fled from the onset of the victorious army, and on his way fell in with Mun'im Kh\u0101n and a body of troops who were marching to join the king. All his goods and chattels came into the hands of the soldiery and he was wounded and forced to take flight. During this turmoil the delegates (wukal\u0101') of Sl. Adam Gakhar, the chief of the Gakhar clan, arrived with a letter and were graciously received. The contents of the letter were that M. K\u0101mr\u0101n had come in distress to his territory; that Sl. Adam, in whose head was the breath of loyalty, did not wish the M\u012brz\u0101 to spend his days in this vagabond fashion; that if His Majesty would come, he would produce the M\u012brz\u0101 in order that the latter might make amends for his crimes and become a\n\n---\n\n1 Jarrett II. 407.\n2 Erskine says that he was reputed to belong to the Cir\u0101gh-k\u014dsh (lamp extinguishing) sect. This is derived from Bay\u0101z\u012bd (62a), who adds that he lived in T\u012br\u0101h.\nservant of dominion's threshold; and that Sl. Adam himself would also do homage.\n\nBe it known that the Gakhars are a numerous clan and that they live between the Bihat (Jehlam) and the Indus. In the time of Sl. Zainu-l-'abidin of Kashmir, there came a Ghaznin officer, named Malik Kid, a kinsman of the ruler of Kabul, and took this country by force from the possession of the Kashmiris. He was succeeded by his son, Malik Kalan, and he again by his son Bir (or Pir). After him came Tat\u0101r Kh\u0101n who had much contest with Sher Kh\u0101n and his son, Salim Kh\u0101n. He regarded himself as attached to His Majesty's family, for at the time when His Majesty G\u0113t\u012b-sit\u0101ni Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b conquered India, he entered his service and did good work. He was especially devoted in the war with R\u0101n\u0101 S\u0101nk\u0101. He had two sons, Sl. S\u0101rang and Sl. Adam. After S\u0101rang the headship of the tribe fell to Sl. Adam. The sons of S\u0101rang Kam\u0101l Kh\u0101n and S\u0101'id Kh\u0101n submitted but were secretly disaffected. J\u014dgi Kh\u0101n, a confidential servant of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, arrived with as Sl. Adam's ambassador and tendered a petition from the Mirz\u0101, full of smooth and baseless words.\n\nAb\u016b-i-fa\u1e63l, the writer of this compendium of wisdom, and the chronicler of the deeds of this noble family, has his mind fixed on the history of His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h and on the diffusion of information concerning his glorious rule. It is to satisfy the thirsty readers of this precious chronicle that he has given,\u2014as a side-piece,\u2014an account of the lofty line from Adam down till now, which is the era of the heir of the universe. It is indispensable to tell briefly the evil acts of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and of his receiving retribution therefor by his own acts. Although the dignity of this noble record is too exalted for the entry of such matters, yet in order to complete the narrative, it is impossible to avoid treating of the low as well as of the high.\n\nLet it not be hidden from the listeners to these strange occurrences,\u2014every one of which is a sermon from a sacred pulpit,\u2014that when that morning, as has been related, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was defeated and escaped with a thousand risks from the hands of the swordsmen,\n\n1 Blochmann 456.\n2 The Gakhars say Tat\u0101r was grandson of Bir and son of Pila.\n3 A.F. means that he was blinded because he had blinded others.\nhe was unable to remain in any one place. From the ruin of his understanding,\u2014the fruit of ingratitude,\u2014and notwithstanding reverses, each of which might have guided him to the highway of auspiciousness,\u2014he did not submit himself to a master so gracious and forgiving, when the dust of remorse and repentance should have covered his face and when he should have come, with shame and apology, to kiss the threshold and atone for his crimes,\u2014but he, the destined pervert, went off to India for the purpose of presenting himself before Salim Kh\u0101n, son of Sher Kh\u0101n, (who in addition to inborn ingratitude, had his brain perturbed by the wine of insouciance and the ferment of pride), and to obtain from him auxiliaries for his disloyalty. Good God! what kind of reason had he to go to his deadly foe to compass the ruin of so great a friend? Why should he submit to indignities to this end? and wish him (Salim) to assist him to contend with his benefactor? To sum up; evil thoughts brought the Mirz\u0101 to this, and with a few followers, he took the road to India. From the neighbourhood of the Khaibar, he sent Sh\u0101h Bud\u0101gh Kh\u0101n to Salim Kh\u0101n who was in Ban,\u00b9 a town of the Panj\u0101b. The Mirz\u0101\u2019s ambassador arrived there and performed his mission. Salim Kh\u0101n perceived that the success of the Mirz\u0101\u2019s wishes was beyond his (Salim\u2019s) power and therefore dissembled. He sent some money for expenses by the envoy and arranged that he (K\u0101mr\u0101n) should wait where he was, and he promised to send him help, and to assign him an income. Before the ambassador had returned to the Mirz\u0101, Ali Mu\u1e25ammad Asp also was sent to Salim Kh\u0101n.\n\nTo sum up this long story, which might better have been shortened;\u2014when the Mirz\u0101 arrived within four kos of Ban, Salim Kh\u0101n sent his own son, \u0100w\u0101z Kh\u0101n, Maul\u0101n\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-l\u0101h Sul\u1e6d\u0101np\u016br and a number of his officers to welcome him. The Mirz\u0101 was received by the Afgh\u0101n leader (i.e., Salim) in a manner unfitting for enemies or street-dogs.\u00b2 His companions were B\u0101b\u0101 J\u016bjak, Mull\u0101 Shaf\u0101\u012b, B\u0101b\u0101\n\n\u00b9 The B\u0101n of Erskine. Perhaps it is Bain in the Bann\u016b country which is marked in Thoburn\u2019s map. It lies south of Edwardesht\u0101d. See too Jarrett II. 393. Raverty (Notes, etc., p. 354), mentions Ban as 19 miles north-east of Sh\u0101lk\u014dt and 8 miles south-west of Jamm\u016b. It is on the east bank of the Cen\u0101b.

See Erskine II. 408 for an account of Kamr\u0101n\u2019s humiliating reception.\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nSa'id Qib\u00e7aq, Shah Budagh, 'Alam Shah, Rahm\u0101n Quli Kh\u0101n, Sal\u012bh Z\u012bw\u0101na, H\u0101ji Y\u016bsuf, 'Ali Mu\u1e25ammad Asp, T\u0101mart\u0101gh, Gh\u0101lib Kh\u0101n, Abd\u0101l K\u016bka and many other broken men whose names had better not be given. As the acts of ingrates and the thoughts of the unfaithful are not for good and meet with disaster in the end, whatever happened to them was the consequence of their actions. The M\u012brz\u0101 was disgusted with the bad manners of this ignorant crew (i.e., the Afgh\u0101ns) and continually reproached Shah Budagh in private, who had instigated him to come.\n\nWhen Salim Kh\u0101n's mind was at rest about the affairs of the Panj\u0101b, he set off for Dihli, taking the M\u012brz\u0101 with him under false promises. He kept saying that he would let him go but did not do so. His idea was to imprison him in one of the strong forts of India. When the M\u012brz\u0101 perceived how things were, and that there was no hope of assistance nor of his own release, he resolved to escape. He sent J\u014dgi Kh\u0101n, his trusted servant, to R\u0101ja Bakh\u016b who was twelve kos from M\u0101ciw\u0101ra and asked for help. The R\u0101ja received the messenger kindly and promised his protection. One day when Salim Kh\u0101n had crossed the M\u0101ciw\u0101ra river, the M\u012brz\u0101 left Y\u016bsuf aft\u0101b\u012b in his (K\u0101mr\u0101n's) sleeping suit and arranged with B\u0101b\u0101 Sa'id to go on for a long time reciting something so that it might be supposed the M\u012brz\u0101 was lying down. He himself changed his clothes and put a veil over his face and then went out by the enclosed side and hastened to the refuge which had been agreed upon. The R\u0101ja gave him a proper reception and when it was reported that an army was coming to search for him, sent him on to the R\u0101ja of Kah\u016br whose was the safest place in the neighbourhood. He too, from fear of enemies, sent the M\u012brz\u0101 on, giving him a guide to Jamm\u016b. But the R\u0101ja of Jamm\u016b from the cautionousness of a landholder, would not allow him to enter his territory. Dismayed and confused, the M\u012brz\u0101 went off to Mank\u014dt. There he was almost captured, and again changing his apparel, he went on, in woman's garb, towards Kabul, in the company of an Afgh\u0101n horse-dealer. Meditating evil, he went to Sl. Adam Gakhar thinking that perhaps he might induce the Gakhar tribe to act with him and to do things which ought not to be done. But Sl. Adam approved of loyalty. He kept the M\u012brz\u0101, by\n\n1 Blochmann 371. See also Raverty \"Notes on Afghanistan,\" 559.\nvarious pretexts, under surveillance and sent to represent the matter at the sublime Court. The Mirz\u0101 also, when he saw disappointing indications in the behaviour of the tribe, was compelled to adopt feline ways and to send a petition, as already stated. Though he tried to induce the Gakhars to join him, he had no success. He did not trouble himself about escaping because he had no refuge; moreover owing to the guard kept over him and to his own fatigue, he saw that it would be difficult to get away. He was obliged to subsist with this people and he learnt that every harmful thought becomes null and void which is entertained by the ill-wisher to a dominion adorned by the Divine splendour and safe-guarded by its protection; and that such an ill-wisher sinks into eternal punishment.\n\nWhen the envoy of Sl. Adam had represented the state of affairs, His Majesty determined to make an expedition into India as far as the Gakhar country. He sent Khw. Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mahm\u016bd to guard and govern K\u0101bul and marched on himself, taking the Sh\u0101h\u012bngsh\u0101h with him, for the furtherance of good fortune. He bound the girdle of determination on the waist of energy that he might end the affair of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n and ease the world from his strife and sin. When the standards of victory reached the Indus, he sent Q\u0101\u1e63\u012b \u1e24am\u012bd, the chief judge of the victorious camp, to Sl. Adam, requesting his presence. He also sent the Mirz\u0101 sage counsel and exhortations, to the effect that he should scour from his heart the rust of opposition and discord. When later, he crossed the Indus, there was no sign of Sl. Adam who apparently was affected by the misplaced apprehensions of a landholder. His Majesty despatched M\u016bn'im Kh\u0101n to soothe him and bring him in. He also sent a few words to the Mirz\u0101 such as might guide him to fortune. M\u016bn'im Kh\u0101n was moreover to ascertain from their actions and manners what were their secret thoughts and to report accordingly. He displayed his abilities and after cajolery and stratagem, Sl. Adam brought the Mirz\u0101 and did homage near Parh\u0101la. His Majesty gave a feast which was kept up all night. Spite of so many crimes,\u2014each one deserving condign punishment,\u2014M. K\u0101mr\u0101n was encompassed with favours. All loyal officers and prudent well-wishers represented that though the kindness and benevolence of His Majesty always required that in his Court, the mantle of pardon should clothe great criminals,\u2014yet foresight and firmness demanded that the oppressor and injurer of\nmankind should receive his deserts, so that the dust of wickedness might be wiped from the face of men's safety. Fore-casting care made it proper that the outward appeasement of one man,\u2014and he an ill-wisher,\u2014should not be preferred to the satisfaction of many distinguished loyalists. What shock would there be to the wall of justice if, to bind up the broken-hearted and heal the wounds of lacerated breasts, the portrait of a tyrant were erased from the world's picture-gallery? Especially when this course involved thousands of advantages. The obliteration of this worthless figure would be in every way pleasing to God and in accordance with general laws. Such ingratitude and rebellion were not of the character to give hope of security or to permit his actions to be regarded as not done. The matter had passed beyond bounds; it could no longer be coped with (tagatha tag shuda). It was advisable for him and for all that he should become a traveller to the world of non-existence, that so God's creatures might be saved from thousands of ills and the record of his deeds become no blacker. People's goods had long been subject to plunder and rapine through the turmoils of this wicked rebel: their property and honour had gone to the winds of strife and the lives of so many men had been valued as dust; and the jewel of sincerity,\u2014which is the neck-ornament of the virtues,\u2014had been lost in the mists of trouble. Now the proper course was to release such a man from the claws of final retribution and to give mankind tranquillity, under the shadow of justice.\n\nHis Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni looked to the wisdom and benevolence of the Causer of causes (God), and declined to engage in this affair. (Nor would he believe) that the world-adorning Initiator would, in spite of his omnipotence, make a man so unutterable, (i.e., as M. K\u0101mr\u0101n). Besides taking this profound view, his discerning eye approved of the admonitions of His Majesty G\u0101ti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b and would not agree to the proposition. His officers, who had witnessed the various bloodsheds and strife caused by this insolent shedder of blood,\u2014were again firm in their request: they took legal opinions which were attested by the law-officers; and they brought a paper signed by the great of realm and religion and laid it before His Majesty. These documents His Majesty sent to M. K\u0101mr\u0101n who having read the record of his deeds and the punishment (proposed), returned the message that those who to-day had put their\nseals for his death, were the men who had brought him to this pass. The spirit of clemency moved His Majesty and, spite of the general insistence and of the existence of so many reasons, would not let him shed the Mirz\u0101\u2019s blood. At length for the general welfare, a special order was issued and they deprived the Mirz\u0101 of sight. \u2018Ali D\u00f6st b\u0101rbeg\u012b (master of the ceremonies), Saiyid Muhammad Pakna and Ghul\u0101m \u2018Ali \u0100s\u0101k-ang\u0101h\u012b were told off for this duty.\n\nThey entered the Mirz\u0101\u2019s tent. He thought they had come to kill him and at once ran at them with his fists. \u2018Ali Dost said, \u201cMirz\u0101, compose yourself: the order is not for death. Why are you agitated? As justice demands,\u2014for you blinded Saiyid \u2018Ali and many other innocent persons,\u2014you will behold in your own eyes the retaliation thereof.\u201d On hearing this, the Mirz\u0101 agreed to submit to the royal commands and endured the insertion of the needle. They blinded both his eyes,\u2014the sentinels of a seditious heart. These loyal servants took the precaution of using the lancet many times. The Mirz\u0101 being thankful that his life was spared, uttered no remonstrance. With his natural kindness, His Majesty expressed his regrets and marched onwards. Many affectionate and loving words rose to his lips. This catastrophe occurred in the end of 960 (Nov.-Dec., 1553). Khw. Mu\u1e25ammad M\u016bman of Farankhud found the chronogram, ni\u1e63\u1e6dar (lancet) = 960.\n\nOn the same day, the Mirz\u0101 sent to Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n to request him by all means in his power, to obtain for him from His Majesty the services of Beg Mul\u016bk. The petition was at once granted and Beg Mul\u016bk was sent. The Mirz\u0101,\u2014owing to the great affection he bore him,\u2014took his hands and placing them over his own sightless eyes, recited this verse:\n\nThough a veil be drawn over my eyes,\nI behold thee with the eye which has oft seen thy face.\n\nAfter this occurrence, His Majesty set off to chastise the J\u0101n\u016bh\u0101 who were vagabonds and impediments of the road. The\n\n---\n\n1 i.e., six-fingered or -toed.\n2 K\u0101mr\u0101n did this at T\u012br\u012b after returning from Sind and before capturing Ghazn\u012bn.\n3 Text 328. Farakh\u016bd is mentioned by Y\u0101q\u016bt as a village near Samarkand. See too Blochmann 434n.\n4 Blochmann 456n. They inhabited the Salt Range. Their proper name is Janju\u2018\u0101h.\nwretched rebels slipped their necks from the collar of obedience and were killed fighting with the heroes of victory. Khw. Q\u0101sim Mahdi and others of the army of fortune attained the glory of martyrdom.\n\nHis mind being at rest about this affair, His Majesty resolved to go to Kashmir, an intention he had cherished for years. His officers thought it inadvisable and abused Kashmir, likening it to a well\\(^1\\) or prison, in order to induce the holy heart to renounce the enterprise, for, they said, \"The noise of the march of the army of fortune has caused commotion in India and Sal\u012bm Kh\u0101n is coming to the Panj\u0101b with great preparation; whilst on our side, there has been no due preparation.\" \"If we go forward and the Afghan army approach us, how can we pass it and go on to Kashmir? Perhaps the Kashmiri affair will be a long one and if so and black-hearted Afghans secure the passes, what will be the end of it? The proper thing is to give up the idea of the expedition and to return to K\u0101bul now that the traitor has been removed from our midst. When military preparations have been made, we will set the foot of courage in the stirrup of energy and by the might of daily-waxing success, shall easily destroy the Afghans.\" His Majesty heard these words, and gave them no heed but despatched His Majesty the Mahinsh\u0101h with many officers to protect K\u0101bul and turned his own rein towards Kashmir and desired to set forth. Acting on the evil teaching of their huckster-natured officers,\u2014who looked to nothing but their own profit,\u2014most of the servants and soldiers left their masters and set out for K\u0101bul. Except officers, none remained to serve His Majesty. By this shameful conduct,\u2014far removed from the path of loyalty and obedience,\u2014the composure of the noble soul was disturbed. He ordered the trusty by all means to turn back the men and not to hesitate, if necessary, to put any to death. Meanwhile he sought an omen from the glorious Koran. It chanced that the story of the faithful Joseph came up. Those who had leave to speak, set themselves to explain this and considered it carefully. Khw. Husain of Merv submitted that what had been said about Kashmir,\u2014viz., that it was like a well or a prison,\u2014was true; for the story of Joseph names both these things.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Alluding to its girdle of mountains.\nWhen disunion showed itself amongst those with him, His Majesty, being compelled to abandon his intention, moved towards Kabul. When he was encamped on the Indus, M. K\u0101mr\u0101n petitioned to be allowed to go to the Hij\u0101z. As His Majesty was now desirous of giving him pleasure, he consented. On the night of dismissing the Mirz\u0101 on his journey, he went with a number of chosen followers to his quarters. After paying due respects, the Mirz\u0101 recited this verse:\n\nThe fold of the poor man\u2019s turban brushes the sky,\nWhen the shadow of a monarch like thee falls on his head.\n\nLater on, this verse was on his tongue;\u2014\n\nWhate\u2019er comes on my life from thee is cause for thanks,\u2014\nBe it shaft of cruelty or dagger of tyranny.\n\nAlthough the second couplet inclines to thanks, a critic can see that it runs over with censure. His Majesty who was a world of compassion and gentleness, took no heed of this but expressed commiseration. With his inspired tongue he said, \u201cHe who knoweth secrets and things hidden, is aware how much ashamed I am of this thing which did not come about with my goodwill.\u201d Would that\n\n1 A.F.\u2019s account of this interview seems to be taken from Bay\u0101z\u012bd (I.O. MS. 64b.) but though he is often a servile copyist, he is rarely quite an accurate one. As I understand Bay\u0101z\u012bd, K\u0101mr\u0101n said, \u201cIf people consider that His Majesty has dealt kindly with me, I attest the fact (\u1e63ijl kardam). Possibly a negative has slipped out here for it would be more to the point if K\u0101mr\u0101n said, \u201cShould people think His Majesty has not dealt kindly by me, I attest the contrary.\u201d A.F. makes K\u0101mr\u0101n say, \u201cIf I were innocent, I would take the opportunity of this visit to attest my innocency.\u201d The text has bahal kardam\u012b, \u201cI would absolve him:\u201d and this is Erskine\u2019s reading of the passage. (A.N. MS. trs.). But after referring to Bay\u0101z\u012bd and other sources, it seems to me that sijl and not bahal is written. This agrees with the context; \u201cWere I innocent, I would take advantage of this public opportunity to assert the fact, but I well know I am guilty.\u201d\n\nIt will be observed that Erskine renders the passage differently in his History (II. 417) and in his MS. trs.\n\n2 Imitated from the Gulist\u0101n III. 19. Blochmann quotes the lines (179).\n\n3 I do not feel sure of the meaning, but I think that Hum\u0101y\u016bn was gently hinting that as K\u0101mr\u0101n, when in power, had blinded several people, he might, if successful against his brother, have blinded Hum\u0101y\u016bn.\nyou had done it to me era this happened.\" The Mirz\u0101 woke from the slumber of negligence and comprehended both the measure of his crimes and the extent of the princely mercies. He fell into a state of shame and supplication and asked H\u00e1ji Y\u016bsuf what persons were present. H\u00e1ji Y\u016bsuf named them, viz., Tardi Beg Kh\u0101n, Mun'im Kh\u0101n, B\u0101b\u016bs Beg, Khw. \u1e24usain' of Merv, Mir 'Abdal-hai, Mir 'Abdu-l-l\u0101h, Khanjar Beg and 'Arif Beg. The Mirz\u0101 said, \"Friends, be ye all witnesses that if I knew myself innocent, I would assert the fact at this time of distinction when His Majesty visits me; but I am certain I was worthy of death. He has granted me life and has given me leave to depart to the Hijsz. For the beneficence and favour of His Majesty, I offer a thousand thanks because he has not exacted retribution commensurate with my wickedness and misconduct.\" After this he passed on to recommendations for his children. His Majesty gladly promised to care for them. Having encompassed the Mirz\u0101 with kingly favours, he bade him adieu. It had been stipulated that the Mirz\u0101 should not lament in the presence and he therefore restrained himself, but, as soon as His Majesty had gone towards his own tent, he wept and lamented.\n\nNext day an order was issued that any of the Mirz\u0101's servants who wished to accompany him, might do so. No one came forward. Those who had boasted of their affection, abandoned it. Calma kika,\u2014(who by his perfect loyalty and fidelity to His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h obtained the title of Kh\u0101n 'Alam and who gave his life for his benefactor and the master of mortals, as will be told in its place),\u2014was standing there. He was His Majesty's table-servant (saftarci) and the recipient of royal favour. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b asked him whether he would go with the Mirz\u0101, or stay with him. The excellence of Court service and the abundance of royal favour notwithstanding, he preferred the path of fidelity to temporal delights and answered, \"I see that it befits my position to serve the Mirz\u0101 in his dark days of helplessness and black nights of loneliness.\"\n\nChalmers translates, \"Would that I had been the sufferer and you the author of the evil.\"\n\n1 See Bad\u0101oni III. 176, for account of this poet and also Tabaq\u0101t-i-akhdari, Luck. ed. 396. Niz\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn says he was son of a vizier and died in Kabul.\n\n2 Blochmann 378.\n\n3 He was son of Hamdam a foster-brother of K\u0101mir\u0101n, so that his fidelity was to the \"milk-brotherhood.\"\nHis Majesty who was the touch-stone of knowledge of men and their accurate balance, highly approved of his faithfulness and though he set value on his services, he let him go. He made over to him the money and goods fixed upon for the expenses of the journey and sent him to the Mirz\u0101. Beg Muluk, notwithstanding his close connection with the Mirz\u0101 went with him some stages only and then returned,\u2014a proceeding exceedingly disapproved by His Majesty and, notwithstanding external agreeableness, he became disregarded.\n\nThe Mirz\u0101 went by the Indus to Tatta and thence to his destination (Mecca). He performed the pilgrimage three times, and on the 11th Z\u012bl-hijja, 964 (5th Oct., 1557), at Mecca, he was borne away to non-existence, uttering these words, in response to the Divine call, \"Here I am for Thee.\"\n\nAs the series of words about M. K\u0101mr\u0101n has now been folded up, I hasten to my proper subject, and record that, as the evil Afgh\u0101ns had destroyed the fort at Bikr\u0101m, known as Pesh\u0101war, where His Majesty was encamped, he determined to rebuild it and leaving a body of his well-wishers in it, to proceed to K\u0101bul:\u2014for the completion of this fort would be the beginning of the conquest of India. The officers wanted to get back to K\u0101bul and were unwilling on any account sooner to delay in this place. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b set himself energetically to the task and in a short time, had the fort rebuilt. Pahlw\u0101n Dost mir barr divided the work, according to orders, amongst the officers and it was soon finished.\n\nSikandar Kh\u0101n Uzbak was left in charge and His Majesty moved towards K\u0101bul.\n\nLater on, the Afgh\u0101ns made a great attack on the fort but Sikandar Kh\u0101n defended it manfully, and they were repulsed.\n\n---\n\n1 Baq\u0101b\u016bl-i-surat\u012bk\u012b d\u0101gh\u012b, mard\u016bd-i-nas\u0101r\u0101h\u0101 shud. This is from Bay\u0101z\u012bd, 65a whose words are:\u2014\"\u0101n b\u012b sa'\u0101dat Beg Mul\u016bk, cand mansil ki hamv\u0101l-i-mirz\u0101 raft, b\u012b ru\u1e25sh\u0101t jud\u0101 shuda \u0101mid in bawaj\u016bd-i-maqb\u016bl\u012b mard\u016bd-i-kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63u '\u0101mm shud. It would seem from text I. 363 that he must have afterwards repented and gone upon the pilgrimage.\n\n2 \u012as Minn\u0101 in text, that being a valley in Mecca. The three \u1e25ajj will be those of 961\u2013963. That of 964 could not have been completed. See Asiatic Quarterly Review, July, 1899, p. 164.\n\n3 See Hughes' Dictionary of Isl\u0101m s.v. talbiyah. Labbaik may be said to correspond to Colonel Newcomb's Adsum.\nthe beginning of 961 (Dec., 1553), Kabul was made glorious by the arrival of His Majesty. The ladies came to wait upon him and offered congratulations. He however said that congratulations had their proper place and that the affair of M. Kamran was not one for congratulation because it was as if he had struck at his own eyes. Gracious letters were issued to the officers. One was sent also to 'Abdu-r-rashid, ruler of Kashghar, who had all along been mindful of kinship and amicably disposed. The letter told what had occurred and was sent by prudent hands. While His Majesty was superintending affairs of state and distributing rewards and punishments, a son was born to him from the chaste womb of Mih Jujak Begam, in this year, on the night of Wednesday, 15th Jumada'l-awwal (19th April, 1554), and after the passing of two dang\\(^1\\) of the sign Sagittarius. His Majesty named him Muhammad Hakim. As the chronograms\\(^2\\) of his birth were both Ab\u016b-l-maf\u0101khir and Ab\u016b-l-fag\u0101l, he received both patronymics (kanyat). The gates of joy were opened and thanks were rendered to God. At about the same time, Khanish Begam, daughter of Jujuk M. of Khw\u0101rizm, gave birth to a son whom they named Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Sl. He soon went to the blessed country ('\u0101lam-i-qads).\n\nVerse.\n\nHe was a flash from high heaven:\nBirth and death touched.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Apparently meaning one-third of a degree.\n\n\\(^2\\) Both names yield 961 (1554).\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nHIS MAJESTY JAHANBANI'S JOURNEY TO QANDAHAR AND HIS RETURN THEREFROM.\n\nIn the beginning of the winter of this year, His Majesty determined to go to Qandahar rather than to India, as a number of strife-mongers had made false representations about Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n. Accordingly he went there. The government of K\u0101bul was entrusted to \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n of Andar\u0101b, and the Divine nursling, eye-pupil of the Khil\u0101fat, prop of glory, His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h accompanied his father as far as Ghazn\u012bn. The prince\u2019s vakils, who were in charge of Ghazn\u012bn, were assiduous in discharging the duties of hospitality. When the royal standards moved onwards from Ghazn\u012bn, the prince returned to K\u0101bul. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n recognised the advent of the king as a great favour and returned thanks for it, with a heart full of loyalty, he did homage at the village of Shor\u0101nd\u0101m, ten leagues out from Qandahar, and His Majesty was convinced that the reports about him were not true. He arrived at Qandahar in an auspicious hour. Splendid feasts were held. Among the distinguished servants present there were Sh\u0101h Ab\u016b\u2019l-ma\u2018\u0101li, Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n, Khizr Khw. Kh\u0101n; Mu\u1e25ibb \u2018Ali Kh\u0101n, (son of) Mir Khal\u012bfa, Ism\u0101\u2018il Duld\u0101d and Haidar Mu\u1e25ammad \u0101khta-beg\u012b. Of the Ahl-i-Sa\u2018\u0101dat (learned or literary men) there were Khw. \u1e24usain of Merv, Maul\u0101n\u0101 \u2018Abdu-l-b\u0101q\u012b the \u1e62adr and others. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n neglected no punctilio of civility and the whole winter was spent in Qandahar in enjoyment. And during this time, whatever was necessary for the king\u2019s privy purse, was all defrayed by Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n. He had all the court servants brought into the houses of his own servants, where their entertainment was provided for. All this time His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b enjoyed sensual and mental recreations and pleasures spiritual and temporal and had feasts and entertainments and visited the\n\n1 Some MSS. read \u201ctwo leagues.\u201d\n2 Tanass\u016bh\u0101t which has for one of its meanings, walking about in gardens.\nhermitages of dervishes and the cells of pure religionists, and distributed largesse in accordance with their conditions. Among others, he frequently visited Maulana Zainu-d-Din Mahmud Kamangar\u00b9 (the bow-maker) who was one of the determined opponents of sensuality, and holy words were spoken on both sides. There were conversations about the attainment of desires in time and eternity.\n\nKhw. Ghazi, who had gone on an embassy to Persia and had come to Qandahar with presents before His Majesty had arrived there, returned to employment and was, on account of his meritorious services, raised to the lofty office of diwan. About the same time Mu'azzam\u00b2 Sl. came from Zamin-Dawar and entered into service. Mihtar Qara, who was one of the trusted followers of Muhammad Khan of Herat also came with valuable offerings and was received into service. He brought representations of fidelity and was encompassed with favours. And for the sake of the State and for the delight of hearts, he had a gamargha hunt in the neighbourhood of Shorandam. This pleased the officers and His Majesty took an omen from it for the capture of his desires.\n\nOne of the evil things which happened in Qandahar was the killing of Sher 'Ali Beg by Shah Abu'l-ma'ali. A brief account of the affair is, that about this time, Sher 'Ali Beg, the father of Qara Beg mir Akbar, came without leave from Shah Tahmasp, the ruler of Persia, and entered the royal service. Shah Abu'l-ma'ali, being intoxicated by Court-favour and by his honours and courage, set his foot outside the circle of moderation, and did extravagant things. And as the evil bigotry of rebellious people had damaged the brain of his faith, he frequently and openly said in the court of His Majesty Jahangiri, that he would kill this heretical fellow. Out of the favour he bore him, His Majesty regarded this as a pleasantry and gave no heed to the matter. At length, Abu'l-ma'ali, being drunk with the wine of bigotry, one night attacked that stranger and poured his blood upon the ground! His Majesty was much displeased, but the close, though superficial relationship\u00b3 was a veil of faults and prevented him from punishing the evil deed.\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann, 539. Bad\u0101'\u012bn III. 161. The fullest account of him is at Bad\u0101'\u012bn I. 455. The saint really was a maker of bows. He was a native of Bahad\u0101r in Khur\u0101s\u0101n.\n\u00b2 Humayun's brother-in-law.\n\u00b3 Humayun called him \"son.\"\nWhen the excellent loyalty of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n was made clear and it became apparent to all that his foot was firm in the path of obedience and good service, His Majesty confirmed him in the government of Qandah\u0101r which it had been his recent intention to give to Mun'im Kh\u0101n. He took Zamin-D\u0101war from Khw. Mu'azzam and gave it to Bah\u0101dur Kh\u0101n, the brother of 'Al\u012b Quli Kh\u0101n. His mind being now at rest about the affairs of his kingdom, he returned to K\u0101bul with the intention of conquering Hindust\u0101n. He gave leave of absence to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n in order that he might make preparations for this expedition and join him as soon as possible. His Majesty took Wali Beg\u00b9 and H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad S\u012bst\u0101n\u012b with him because people were continually telling tales of them and putting together the materials of strife. Near Ghaznin, he was met by His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h and it was a meeting like the conjunction\u00b2 of favourable planets. Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Kh\u0101n Barlas and Atka Kh\u0101n (Shamsu-d-d\u012bn) and many others did homage and at the end of 961 (Oct., 1554), K\u0101bul received celestial glory by his advent.\n\nAt this time, Mun'im Kh\u0101n was raised to the office of guardian of His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h. Though, from use and wont, His Majesty gave the name of guardian (at\u0101liq) to the elder man, yet in reality he sent him like a child, to learn wisdom from that exhibitor of universal reason. Mun'im Kh\u0101n returned thanks to Heaven for this great gift and prepared a glorious feast. He also tendered fitting gifts and arranged the materials of his own exaltation. In this year, Ulugh Beg, the son of Halhal Sl. arrived on the part of the ruler of Persia, and tendered gifts which were a cause of increasing joy. His Majesty continually looked after the administration of justice and also engaged himself in preparations for the conquest of Hind\u016bst\u0101n. At this time one of the dervishes who was famous in foreign lands (wil\u0101yat) had sent a pair of boots as a gift: His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b said that he drew an omen from these boots favourable to the conquest of Hind\u016bst\u0101n for it was a common saying that Turkist\u0101n is the head, Khur\u0101s\u0101n the breast and Hind\u016bst\u0101n the foot (of the poem on the meeting of Kaikub\u0101d and his father, N\u0101siru-d-d\u012bn. Elliot III. 524.\n\n\u00b9 Blochmann, 374 and 518. Wali Beg was apparently a grand-nephew of H\u0101ji Mu\u1e25ammad K\u014dka.\n\u00b2 An allusion to Amir Khusrau's\nworld). He said this omen was like that mentioned by His Majesty \u0160\u0101h\u012bb-qir\u0101n\u012b, viz., that in the year in which he moved from Transoxiana to conquer Khur\u0101s\u0101n and when he arrived at Andarkh\u016b\u012b, a village in which lived a dervish named Sang\u012b \u0100t\u0101' who was famous for purity of heart and for his miracles,\u2014His Majesty \u0160\u0101h\u012bb-qir\u0101n\u012b went to visit him. By way of already-made (m\u0101 \u1e25azar) breakfast, the dervish placed before him the breastbone of a sheep. His Majesty (Tim\u016br) observed to his courtiers that he drew an omen, from this breast, for the conquest of Khur\u0101s\u0101n because Khur\u0101s\u0101n was called the breast of the world.\n\nBair\u0101m Kh\u0101n arrived on the day following the feast of Ramz\u0101n (the \u012ad,\u20142nd Shawwal,\u201431st August). His Majesty, for the sake of giving greater pleasure and out of the affection he bore him, had the feast repeated and gave an entertainment more splendid than that of the \u012ad. On this joyful day, which was made the test day for horsemen and dextrous archers, the royal cavalier of the plain of fortune and nursling of the spring of glory, to wit, His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, felt disposed to engage for a time in shooting at the qabaq and to show his archer's skill to the generality and thus to lead them on the way of devotion. The first time he aimed at the qabaq, which experienced marksmen had failed to hit,\u2014his arrow struck the ligature of the golden ball. At this all the people shouted. Such a thing appeared wonderful to the superficial, but what marvel was there in it to those who have beheld with awakened eyes the real spectacle of the mysteries of the lord of the world. How is it strange that he who is a mine of substantial wonders, should display external marvels? Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n composed an excellent ode on His Majesty's\n\n---\n\n1 The Zafarn\u0101ma (Bib. Ind. ed. I. 310) gives the name of the dervish as B\u0101b\u0101 Sank\u0101. See also P\u00e9tit de la Croix's trs. ed. 1732, II. 315. The occurrence took place at Andarkh\u016b\u012b west of Balkh. The dervish did not exactly place the bone before Tim\u016br as a m\u0101 \u1e25azar\u012b, for he flung it at Tim\u016br's head. A.F. speaks of the story as having been told by Tim\u016br. In Tim\u016br's Memoirs (trs. Stewart, p. 38) there is an allusion to an omen taken from a sheep bone but nothing about a saint. Nor indeed is it necessary to regard A.F. as referring to the personal Memoirs. His words,\u2014\u0101n taf\u0101'\u016bl\u012b ki \u1e24a\u1e93rat \u0160\u0101h\u012bb-qir\u0101n\u012b form\u016bda b\u016bdand may mean only \"the omen which Tim\u016br explained.\"\n\n2 For account of this sport see B\u0101bar's Mem. Erskine, 21n. and Vullers s.v.\nqabag-shooting and presented it at the feast. The opening couplet is as follows:\n\nThine arrow has snatched the fastening of the ball from the crook:\\(^1\\)\n\nIt has made the curve like a meteor grazing the Pleiades.\n\nDuring this time of enjoyment when the thought of the conquest of Hind\u016bst\u0101n was lighting up the hearts of loyal servants,\u2014petitions came from the faithful in Hind\u016bst\u0101n and brought to the royal ears news of the death of Sal\u012bm Sh\u0101h and of the confusion of the country.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The kajak is the wooden crook which in the game of qabaq-shooting was attached to the pole and on which balls of gold or silver, or gourds were suspended. Bair\u0101m's verses are quoted, with variation, in the Bah\u0101r-i-'ajam s.v. kajak. The second line of the couplet is obscure. Amongst others, hil\u0101l has the meanings of the young moon and of a spear-point: I presume it also may mean an arrow. Indeed hil\u0101l\u012b means a crescent-headed arrow. The Lucknow editor understands by hil\u0101l, the half-moon of the thumb nail which is contiguous to the thumb-stall (zihg\u012br) of archers. The surat-i-parw\u012bn of the couplet he explains as being the balls of the qabaq,\u2014for it seems that several were sometimes used: He would seem to understand the line, as \"Thy finger has made the balls assume the appearance of the Pleiades, brushed by a meteor.\" Maulvi Abd\u016bl Haq Ab\u012bd understands by hil\u0101l the curved end of the kajaks or suspending rod. Bad\u0101oni (I. 480) quotes Bair\u0101m's lines and says they, as well as similar ones by Jah\u012b Yatm\u0101n, are derived from an ode by Ni\u1e63\u0101r\u012b of T\u0101n. See also Ranking's translation, 622. He states that the crescent moon is compared to an erasing-knife.\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nBRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS AND MISFORTUNES WHICH TOOK PLACE IN HINDUSTAN DURING THE DAYS OF CONFUSION.\n\nAs the thread of the story has been drawn out so far it is necessary that the chronicles give a short account of India so that the condition of impatient awaiting may not befall the intelligent members of the congregation of understanding. The brief account is, that when on 11th Rabi\u2018u-l-awwal, 952 (23rd May, 1545), Sher Khan, after having established his power by wickedness and tyranny and having ruled five years, two months and thirteen days,\u2014went to the abode of nothingness, his younger son, Salim Khan, eight days afterwards, took his father\u2019s seat by the instrumentality of the officers. He ruled eight years, two months and eight days. For some time he had to carry on a war with his elder brother \u2018Adil Khan and with Khw\u0101s Khan. This last was one of Sher Khan\u2019s slaves, and obtained a reputation for sanctity among the commonalty by making a fair show, (ablatar\u0101zi, perhaps, \u201cplastering the boil\u201d) by trickery (gurbzat) and by seizing men\u2019s property and by distributing the acquisitions of the learned among the base and ignorant. As contention with one\u2019s own master,\u2014even though he be worthless,\u2014does not prosper, the schemes of those strifemongers did not succeed. Salim Khan also contended for a time with the Niy\u0101z tribe who ruled the Panjab, their leader being Haibat Khan. They were overcome and in the defiles of the mountains of Kashmir fell into the abyss of destruction. He also was occupied for some time in fighting with the Gakhars, and did not prevail, for his servants could not get the better of them, and they (the Gakhars) were loyal to the holy family (the Timurids). He completed the fort\n\n---\n\n1 See Erskine\u2019s translation of this passage, and his account of Khw\u0101s Khan. It would not be uncharitable to suppose that Khw\u0101s Khan had not shown favour to A.F.\u2019s father and family.\nof Roht\u0101s which Sher Kh\u0101n had begun, and he had a presage of evil when he was in the Siw\u0101lik hills and founded the fort of M\u0101nk\u014dt as a refuge for himself. For a long time he laboured under apprehensions on account of the Afgh\u0101n vagabonds and his own bad life, and spent his days in the fort of Gu\u0101li\u0101r. Though he dealt equitably with the peasantry, he treated the soldiers very harshly. On 22nd Zi\u2019l-qa\u2019d\u0101, 960 (October 30th, 1553), he died from a malignant ulcer which formed in one of his lower members owing to the issue of corrupt matter. According to his will, Fir\u016bz Kh\u0101n, who was of tender age was appointed his successor, but after a few days M\u016bb\u0101riz Kh\u0101n, who was Fir\u016bz\u2019s maternal uncle, put that innocent one to death, and himself assumed the sovereignty, taking the name of Mu\u1e25ammad \u2018\u0100dil. He was the son of N\u012bz\u0101m Kh\u0101n, younger brother of Sher Kh\u0101n. This N\u012bz\u0101m had one son and three daughters, and a strange thing was that the son became a ruler and the husbands of the three daughters rose to high rank,\u2014for one was Sal\u012bm Kh\u0101n, another Sikandar S\u016br, and the third was Ibr\u0101h\u012bm S\u016br. A brief account of these last two will be given hereafter. Him\u016b who, by evil speaking, evil plotting and calumny which, as rulers have to study mankind, gives them pleasure, and this to such an extent that the pleasure hides from their penetrating gaze constitutional faults and innate wickedness, rose from low degree to high rank and became the prime minister of that tyrant, who spent all his time in sport and amusement and bodily lusts, and neglected affairs. Confusion was produced in the world. Now that we have come so far it is proper that a brief account should be given of Him\u016b.\n\nACCOUNT OF HIM\u016a.\n\nLet him who searches out the marvels of God\u2019s power take a long view and get an instructive warning from the account of Him\u016b. Outwardly he had neither rank (hash) nor race (nasab), nor beauty of form, (g\u016brat) nor noble qualities (sairat). Perchance the incomparable Deity raised him to high position for some occult reason which was hidden from the eyes of the acute, or perhaps He sent one worse than themselves to chastise the wicked of the age. In short\n\n---\n\n1 A.F. means that rulers have from their position to welcome evil-speaking as it is the only way in which they can get information. A true reflection upon despotism but strange to come from A.F.\nthat evil-looking one of puny form and lofty designs was ranked among the petty hucksters of Rew\u0101r\u012b which is a township of Mew\u0101t. For his family, (nasab), he belonged to the Dh\u016bsar tribe which is the lowest class of hucksters in India. At the back of lanes he sold salt-petre (nimak-i-g\u0101l\u014dr) with thousands of mortifications (ba haz\u0101r\u0101n bini-mak\u012b) till at last he by means of astuteness, became a government huckster under Salim Kh\u0101n, of whom a short account has already been given. By masterpieces of feline trickery, he gradually made himself known to Salim Kh\u0101n by evil-speaking and business capacity. He was always getting people into trouble. Apparently he was behaving loyally towards his master, in reality he was seeking his own ends, and decking his own household with the goods of the oppressed. Avaunt; avaunt! he was preparing destruction for his lord and striking the axe into his own foot. Here the great ones of the world made a big mistake for these much-occupied ones from their wishing to know about men give place to wicked talebearers, either in order to learn hidden things about them or to punish evildoers. Though they make an engagement with themselves that they will not use the information for attacking the reputation and honour of the good and loyal, yet the outwardly well-seeming but inwardly base crew of men seize their opportunity and for their own advantage attack the loyal with their smooth tongues,\u2014while the great sometimes, owing to the multiplicity of business, forget the engagements with themselves and become suspicious of the loyal and raze the foundations of their own power.\n\nIn short this wicked man soon got a place in Salim Kh\u0101n\u2019s affections by misrepresentation, and obtained a footing in the administration. When the measure of Salim Kh\u0101n\u2019s life was full, and the period of the sway of the evildoers of India had come to Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n aforesaid who was Salim Kh\u0101n\u2019s cousin, H\u012bm\u016b found him careless of worldly affairs and annexed the whole of the administration and rose to lofty offices. Nothing remained to Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n, who was commonly known as \u2018Adl\u012b (tyrant), except the name (of king). H\u012bm\u016b undertook all appointments and dismissals, and the distribution of justice. In his foresight he got possession of\n\n1 In the G\u0101rg\u0101on district and a railway-junction.\n2 The text has d\u012bn\u012b, of faith, but surely this is a mistake for d\u0101ny\u0101, though it seems that d\u012bn may also have a temporal meaning.\nthe treasures of Sher Kh\u0101n and Sal\u012bm Kh\u0101n and of their elephant-stud. He was freehanded in disposing of their accumulations. His base debtors worshipped him and did his behests. For some days he took the title of R\u0101i and then he fastened the title of R\u0101ja on himself and assumed the style of the R\u0101ja Bikram\u0101jit. Thus did he in his folly apply great names to himself. From foresight he preserved the nominal sovereignty for \u2018Adli and waged great wars against his opponents. By his valour and daring he was victorious and performed great deeds. He became famous for courage and capability. By degrees he advanced so far as to venture to encounter the sublime army of His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h. But as this holy personality was the touchstone of the good and bad, his counterfeit coin was tested and his black existence annihilated by the lights of world-illuminating justice! This will be related in its proper place.\n\nNow that one out of a thousand of Him\u016b\u2019s evil behaviours has been described, I proceed to a brief account of Hind\u016bst\u0101n.\n\nWhen the sovereignty came to Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n, the affairs of India became worse than before. In fact both father and son (i.e., Sher Kh\u0101n and Salim) behaved properly in the management of affairs. Alas! that they should have spent their days in disloyalty and ingratitude! If these two had been servants of the sublime threshold of His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, and if the home administration had been entrusted to the father, and the guardianship of the marches to the son, they would have been encompassed with royal favours, and have gained, by good service, an existence which the wise regard as real life. Such workers deserved such a master. As for the vulgar form of rule which is brought about by rebellion, it is regarded by the wise as an existence inferior by many degrees to death.\n\nIn short when Sal\u012bm Kh\u0101n died, Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n showed such behaviour as may no other person evince! Ahmad Kh\u0101n S\u016br the sister\u2019s husband of Sal\u012bm Kh\u0101n who had charge of the Panj\u0101b, became a claimant for the sovereignty and styled himself Sikandar Kh\u0101n. And Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, who was nearly connected with Sher Kh\u0101n and was the Governor of Bengal, aimed at general supremacy. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n S\u016br who was also a relation, set about obtaining the rule of India while Shaj\u2019at Kh\u0101n, who was commonly known as Saj\u0101wal Kh\u0101n, raised his head high in M\u0101lwa. The vagabond Afgh\u0101ns gathered together and caused confusion. Sikandar\ncollected the army of the Panj\u0101b and other vagabonds and meditated an attack upon \u0100gra. Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm advanced with the same intention. At last by the wishes of Him\u016b, Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n went off to the eastward, and a battle took place near \u0100gra, between Sikandar and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm was defeated and had to retire, while his father Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n S\u016br, who governed B\u012bsna, sheltered himself in the fort. Sikandar\u2019s affairs became prosperous, and he got possession of the country from the Indus to the Ganges. He collected an army and wished to march eastwards to dispose of the claimant to the throne and to become sole monarch. At this time the reverberation of the advance of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101n\u012b for the conquest of India rose high. T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n and H\u0101bil Kh\u0101n and a large body of troops were appointed to defend the Panj\u0101b. Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n, the Governor of Bengal, determined to rid himself of Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n and other competitors. After some other events, a great battle took place near Capparghatta between him and Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n and Him\u016b, and Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n fell. The treasures of Sher Kh\u0101n and Salim Kh\u0101n came into Him\u016b\u2019s hands. He sank into the enjoyment of corporeal pleasures, and in appearance his circumstances improved. At this time he fought battles with Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and other competitors. He was everywhere victorious. And though he did not know how to ride a horse and was always carried about in an elephant-box (sind\u016bq-i-fil qr. hauda) he in his courage and audacity freely spent the money which had come of itself into his hands, and did great deeds such as men could not conceive. As Sikandar was established in \u0100gra, he went off to Bih\u0101r and Bengal. Khizr Kh\u0101n, the son of Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n took his father\u2019s place and assumed a great title, calling himself Sl. Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn. He applied himself to the management of Bengal. Mub\u0101riz Kh\u0101n and Him\u016b determined to go to Bengal, but spent some time in getting rid of their opponents. But I leave these details, which I have no inclination to describe in the closet of neglect, to proceed to my legitimate subject.\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nEXPEDITION OF HIS MAJESTY JAH\u0100NB\u0100NI JANNA\u1e6c-\u0100SHY\u0100NI FOR THE CONQUEST OF INDIA, AND VICTORY THEREOF BY THE DOMINION-INCREASING AUSPICES OF THE KING OF KINGS (AKBAR).\n\nLet it not be concealed from those waiting for strange impressions and the listeners for glorious news, that when the truth about the confusion in India and the tumult and uproar in this centre of peace and tranquillity, of which some hints have been already been given, again came to the hearing of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101ni Jannat-\u0101shy\u0101ni, he addressed himself to the expedition, already determined upon in the recesses of his foreseeing mind, and having committed all the chaste ladies of his family in K\u0101bul to the Divine protection, he appointed Sh\u0101h Wali bak\u0101wal-beg\u012b the guardian of M. Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24ak\u012bm. The service of the ladies and the affairs of the province of K\u0101bul were entrusted to Mun\u2018im Kh\u0101n, and His Majesty set out in the middle of Z\u016bl-hijja 961, (about 12th November, 1554), in a propitious hour and at a time which the heavenly motions made glorious, and the aspects of the stars made supreme. The nursling of Divine light, His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h to wit, was then, as regards his elemental life, twelve years and eight\u00b9 months old. The perfect understanding of that great one of both worlds was beyond computation. He was made the forefront of the army of spiritual and temporal victories. On the day of starting an omen was taken from the diw\u0101n of H\u0101fiz. As a great work was being unveiled the heralds of glad tidings from people and places spake loudly and with thousands of tongues. Among them this holy\n\n\u00b9 Text, hasht, but probably A.F. wrote shash, six, for Akbar was then barely 12\u00bd lunar years old. According to our calendar he was only 12 years and 1 month old.\nmaster-conplet (\u0101shbait) on the front of the noble page emerged as a preamble of victory and was like the writing on the forehead of dominion.\n\nVerse.\n\n\"Ask dominion from the auspicious bird (murgh-i-humayun)\nand from his shadow\n\nFor the crow and the kite have not the master-plume of genius (text, himmat, but \u1e24\u0101fiz, apparently wrote daulat).\n\nThough the practically wise applied this truthful verse to the dominion and victory of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, the far seeing of wisdom's Court understood it as announcing the great khilafat and the supreme sovereignty of His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h and waited at the gate of the expectation of the upward flight of the holy bird. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b laid firm hold of the strong hand of the Divine favour and grasped the stout cable of heavenly tidings and went off with few men\u2014they did not amount to 3000,\u2014but with large help from the armies of Providence, which could not be calculated by intellectual accountants. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n obtained leave\n\n1 The lines come from an ode of \u1e24\u0101fiz beginning kastag\u0101nr\u0101 aqfalab bashid-u-guwwat nab\u016bd, Ed. Brockhaus II. 137 No. 216. The crow and the kite are taken to represent India See Elliot Hist. III. 546n. where we are told that the expression \"cawing crows\" is used by Badl Ch\u0101d and Amir Khasr\u016b to signify Hind\u016bs. No doubt the allusion as to their complexion, and Elliot's note may also explain an obscure passage of Haidar Mirz\u0101's (Tar Rash, Elias and Ross 399) where we are told that Khw\u0101ja N\u0101r\u0101 changed Humayun not to cast his shadow over a land where the parrot was less common than the kite. The translator's note to this passage seems erroneous. Though the parrot is common in India yet it is not so common as the kite, and apparently the Khw\u0101ja meant to warn Humayun against going to Sind or remaining in India. He cannot have meant Persia, for Humayun went there, and Haidar says that he did not go to a country where the parrot was rarer than the kite. See also the line of Q\u0101sim K\u0101hi (Bad\u0101oni III. 173) where he says that he is not a kite or a crow that he should adorn India. The lines quoted by Haidar Mirz\u0101 are given also by Bad\u0101oni (II. 49) and are applied by him to India. They come from an ode by \u1e24\u0101fiz which begins Kh\u0101shast khilwat agar y\u0101r y\u0101r-i-manb\u0101shid, Brockhaus' ed. II. 109, No. 189.\n\n2 Apparently this means that they waited in expectation of Humayun's death.\nfor the purpose of setting some royal matters, and of arranging his equipment and remained in K\u0101bul. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b went from Jal\u0101l\u0101bad\\(^1\\) down the river on a raft, and encamped at B\u012bkr\u0101m (Peshawar) in the end of Mu\u1e25arram 962, (near end of December, 1554). Sikandar Kh\u0101n Uzbak who had done good service, was made the subject of favours and on that day was raised to the rank of Kh\u0101n. On 5th \u1e62afar, (31st December, 1554), the bank of the river Sind, known as the Nil\u0101b, was made the camping ground, and three days were spent there. Here Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n arrived from K\u0101bul, and with sundry intelligencers brought the good news that T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n K\u0101shi\\(^2\\) who had been appointed with a large force to guard the fort of Roht\u0101s had, in spite of the strength of the fort etc., fled merely on hearing of the uprearing of the royal standards on the borders of the Indus. His Majesty took into account the good offices, old and new, of Sult\u0101n Adam Gakhar and sent him a gracious letter inviting him to come and do homage. As he had not a happy star, he made landholder-like excuses and represented that he had concluded a treaty with Sikandar who had taken his son Lashkari along with him. Should he come and do homage, he would both break his compact, and incur the risk of having his son killed. The imperial servants represented that it was proper to order the victorious army to look after him (Sult\u0101n Adam) before advancing further, and that it was not wise to move on and leave such a disaffected person behind. His Majesty, who was a mine of gentleness and generosity, said that he belonged to a family which was faithful from of old, and that recently he had done good service, as already related, and that to punish him now was not in accordance with prestige, especially as he had used humble language and had made apologies.\n\nWhen the grand army crossed the Indus, the Afgh\u0101ns who were collected in the neighbourhood of Roht\u0101s retreated and the army continued to advance. Every day a delightful spot presented itself, and cities and villages came under the shadow of justice and enjoyed the luxury of tranquillity. And now that we have come so far,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Similarly Wood went on a raft from Jal\u0101labad to Pesh\u0101war, p. 280.\n\n\\(^2\\) B\u0101yaz\u012bd calls him Isk\u0101ndar Sul-\n\nt\u0101ni Quz\u0101q.

Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, Tardi Beg Kh\u0101n, Iskandar Kh\u0101n, Khizr Kh\u0101n Haz\u0101ra, Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl Beg D\u016bldai and a large troop were sent against Na\u1e63\u012bb Kh\u0101n Panj Bhaiya (?) who was stationed at Harh\u0101na (Har\u012bana) while His Majesty himself went on to Lahore. The nobles of that country came forward to welcome him. They offered up thanks for this glorious favour and gave large presents. High and low were treated with royal favours according to their degree. On the 2nd Rabi\u02bf-\u02bfa\u1e63-\u1e63ani, (24th February, 1555), the illustrious city of Lahore, which is in fact a great city of India, was made glorious by his advent, and all classes and conditions of men were freed from the evils of the times, and attained the objects for which they had been long waiting on hope\u2019s highway.\n\nIn the end of this month news came that an Afgh\u0101n named Sh\u0101hb\u0101z Kh\u0101n had collected a number of Afgh\u0101ns in Dip\u0101lpur and was indulging in evil intentions. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b sent to that quarter Sh\u0101h Abu\u02be-\u02bfl-Ma\u02bf\u0101li \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n Shaib\u0101n\u012b, \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n Andar\u0101b\u012b, Muhammad Kh\u0101n Jal\u0101r and a number of brave officers. A hot engagement ensued, and both sides exposed their lives. The Sayyidz\u0101da Abu\u02be-\u02bfl-Ma\u02bf\u0101li who was intoxicated with the world and proud of his beauty, got into difficulty but \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n and other heroes performed wonders. The enemy was defeated and many of them were levelled with the dust. The imperial servants returned victorious. Now that I have proceeded so far it is necessary that I give a brief account of the victorious army which was placed under the leadership of Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n.\n\nLet it not be hidden from the inquirers into events that when Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n arrived near pargana Harh\u0101na (Har\u012bana), Na\u1e63\u012bb Kh\u0101n Afgh\u0101n made a small resistance\u2014suitable to his nature,\u2014and then fled. Great booty in money and goods fell into the hands of the heroes. Families also were captured. As Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n had heard from His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b that he had vowed there should be no imprisonment when he should, by God\u2019s help, conquer India, and that the servants of God should not be confined, he got on horseback and collected together all the families of the Afgh\u0101ns and sent them with trustworthy people to Na\u1e63\u012bb Kh\u0101n. And he sent as the proceeds of this victory, which might be regarded as the preface to countless others, presents of elephants, etc., with a petition of his\nown to the world-protecting court of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b. Having offered up thanks for this agreeable victory, he left that place and advanced further. When he came near Jalandhar, the Afgh\u0101ns thought it prudent to fly, and owing to the disputes which occurred in the victorious army, they were able to save their lives and the best of their property. The short account of this is that Tardi Beg Kh\u0101n wanted to go after the dispersed Afgh\u0101ns and Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n did not approve of this and did not give him permission. Tardi Beg Kh\u0101n sent B\u0101lt\u016b Kh\u0101n to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n in order that by all means possible he might get leave to pursue them. B\u0101lt\u016b Beg came and delivered his message and Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam Sult\u0101n spoke harshly and abused him. B\u0101lt\u016b Kh\u0101n retorted and the Khw\u0101ja used his sword and wounded B\u0101lt\u016b Kh\u0101n in the arm. When His Majesty heard of this he wrote a letter of admonition and sent Afzal Kh\u0101n to explain matters. He conveyed His Majesty's counsels to the officers and brought about a reconciliation. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n halted in Jalandhar, and assigned parganas in the neighbourhood to the various officers and sent them to their several posts. Sikandar Kh\u0101n was appointed to M\u0101ciw\u0101ra. He went and thinking he had it in hand, advanced further, and took possession of Sihrind. Much property fell into his hands. Meanwhile T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n, H\u0101bil Kh\u0101n, Na\u1e63\u012bb Kh\u0101n, Mub\u0101rak Kh\u0101n and a number of Afgh\u0101n soldiers arrived from Delhi. Sikandar Kh\u0101n did not think it prudent to remain in Sihrind and came to Jalandhar. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n did not approve of this and was angry. He said that Sikandar should have kept his ground at Sihrind and have sent word to him. After much discussion the great officers took hold of the saddle-straps of the royal, everduring fortune and advanced from Jalandhar. When they came to the borders of M\u0101ciw\u0101ra, Tardi Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n and many officers did not think it advisable to cross the Satlaj. As the rainy season was near at hand the proper thing to do, they said, was to secure the ferries and to halt. When the violence of the rains was over, and the air had become temperate, they could cross the river. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n and the farsighted perceived that it was right to cross the river and spoke properly in this sense. At length by the exertions of Mull\u0101 Pir Mu\u1e25ammad, Mu\u1e25ammad Q\u0101sim Kh\u0101n of Nish\u0101p\u016br, Wali Beg and \u1e24aidar Quli Beg Sh\u0101ml\u016b, Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n crossed the river. Tardi Beg Kh\u0101n and the other officers were obliged to\ndo likewise. The army of fortune was divided into four bands. The centre was controlled by Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, the right wing by Kh\u012br Kh\u0101n Haz\u0101ra, the left wing by Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n, while Sikandar Kh\u0101n and a number of active men were appointed to the vanguard. As the desires of the prince of the world were limited to the laws of justice and were in accordance with the Divine Will, the work of his ministers was daily more and more victorious. When the Afgh\u0101ns heard of the smallness of the victorious army and of its having crossed the river, they hastily came up with a large force. The two forces encountered one another towards evening and a great battle took place. The farseeing soldiers chose a place near Bijana\u00b9 (?) for the battle field and stood firm. All distinguished themselves, but at last night intervened. Even then they continued to discharge arrows. By a happy chance, which was the beginning to the victory, fire broke out in a very large village of thatched houses and this was like the lighting of thousands of lamps for the guidance of the troops. It was found on inquiry that this Divine aid was wrought by the exertions of the enemy. And what they had thought was for their advantage turned to their loss. In fact by means of this illumination, which was the vanguard of victory, the conquering heroes obtained information concerning the position of the enemy and were enabled to work havoc with their arrows. The foe did not know the position of the victorious army and shot in the dark and at random. When about three watches of the night had passed, the enemy was unable to resist any longer and took to flight. A great victory was gained. Elephants and much other property fell into the hands of the imperial servants. The chief of the booty was sent with a loyal petition to the Court. Next day they advanced and halted in Sihrind and \u2018Ali Quli Shaib\u0101n\u012b who had come up with the rear, was sent on with a body of troops.\n\nOne of the wonderful things was that when His Majesty heard that T\u0101t\u0101r Kh\u0101n had arrived with a large and well equipped army\n\n\u00b9 M\u0101ciw\u0101ra is on the S. bank of the Satlaj. Fir\u016bqta says they crossed the river and halted on the bank of the Pacw\u0101ra stream. Is Pacw\u0101ra the name of the side of the river opposite M\u0101ciw\u0101ra? Jab means a trench and this may be the meaning here. Price read bah\u0101r\u012b, as some MSS. have it, and translates \u201cby the side of a considerable fresh water lake.\u201d It is probably a place-name.\nat M\u0101ciw\u0101ra, he remarked to a number of eager spirits that the place was a great distance off and that whatever the Divine Will intended would take place before they could arrive. The best thing therefore was for them to take refuge at the sublime threshold and to implore victory from the almonry of Divine aid. At the same moment he raised high the hands of supplication and asked for the success of the advance forces of the royal army. Many days had not passed when the official report of the victory arrived and much booty was brought to the Court. On consideration, it was found that the day of prayer and the day of victory coincided. He paid the devotions of thanksgiving for the Providential victory and opened the hand of liberality for mankind.\n\nWhen Sikandar heard what had taken place, he marched against the royal army with 80,000 horse and a complete equipment. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n with abundant prudence and courage remained firm in Sihrind and took measures to defend the fort. He sent representations one after the other requesting the advance of His Majesty. As the latter was at that time suffering from cholic, he sent in his room the parterre-adorner of the khil\u0101fat, viz., His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h who always had victory at his stirrup. The cort\u00e8ge of this khedive of the world had not gone far from Lahore when His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b perfectly recovered, and on account of the distress of separation, and also out of precaution joined in the march. He directed that Farhat Kh\u0101n should be the shiqd\u0101r of Lahore, B\u0101b\u016bs Beg the faujd\u0101r of the Panj\u0101b, M. Sh\u0101h Sul\u1e6d\u0101n the amin and Mihtar Jauhar the treasurer. On the night of 7th Rajab, (29th May, 1555), the territory of Sihrind was illuminated by the royal advent. The officers did homage, and the drums of rejoicing were beaten. For fifteen days the officers had kept their ground in the face of such a large army and had occupied themselves in garrison-work. The royal tents were erected in a garden near the city. The arrangements for battle were suitably made and the army was distributed into four divisions. One was called by the honoured name of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b; another by that of His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h; a third by that of Sh\u0101h Ab\u016b\u2019l-Ma\u02bf\u0101li; the fourth was entrusted to Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n. Each division bound the girdle of effort on the waist of their lives. The heroes displayed a willingness to risk their lives, and on\n\n---\n\n1 Revenue officer, Jarrett II. 49.\neach side men drank the last draught in the cup of the sword. On both sides humanity and gentleness were practised so that the bodies of those who had sacrificed their lives, were reverently made over to their friends. The shortsighted looking to the plurality of the enemy and the paucity of the king's forces, became pale from unbecoming apprehensions, but the farsighted read the inscription of victory on the countenances of the imperial servants and daily became more and more steadfast. Especially did His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b, who was a world of resolution, hearten every one by fitting behaviour, and inspire them with courage.\n\n1 *Aul\u012by\u0101-i-daulat*, servant of the State, but here probably a periphrasis for Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Akbar. See Lumsden's Persian Grammar, Calcutta, 1810, II. 363.\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nAPPEARANCE OF GREAT MARVELS; AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF GOOD NEWS ON THE PART OF HIS MAJESTY THE SHAHINSHAH; AND OTHER FORTUNATE OCCURRENCES.\n\nThough His Majesty the Shahinshah used his tender age as a veil and lived secluded, yet, as God the Creator willed that the real state of this great one of the age should be made manifest,\u2014involuntarily did wondrous works, each of which was a competent witness to his lofty nature (sh\u0101hide ast'adil), hasten to the world of manifestation. Among the unusual things which at this time revealed themselves on the part of His Majesty the Shahinshah, was this, that he came out on the roof of a house in the city and contemplated with his clime-comprehending glance the hostile army. It was so great an army that no one could imagine its being defeated, but he said that in a short time \u201cour\u201d men would disperse it. His entourage who knew of his far-sight and had often beheld his marvels, rejoiced at this tidings, and offered thanks to God. Things like this look strange to custom-worshippers and formalists. But the worshippers of truth, and the esoteric do not regard this occurrence or hundreds like it as strange when coming from one so eminent temporally and spiritually.\n\nAt this time Khwaja \u2018Ambar N\u0101zir, who was an old servant, came from K\u0101bul and applied for employment. His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b made him over to the nursling of Divine light. Forthwith he entered into his service and used to explain to him the manners and customs of India, and he brought Indians before the Unique of the age. As the star of the men of India was powerful, their ways became pleasing to him. This was the first time that he conceived an inclination for hunting with the c\u012bla (hunting leopard), and the first place where he saw the sport. For Wali Beg the father of the\nKh\u0101n Jah\u0101n presented as peshkash a c\u012bta which had come into his hands from the Afgh\u0101ns at the battle of M\u0101c\u012bw\u0101ra and was called Fatehb\u0101z (the gamester of victory). The farseeing who were in his entourage made conjectures about countless victories on seeing this strange form. The keeper of this c\u012bta was called D\u016bnd\u016b and on account of his good qualities, he received the title of Fateh Kh\u0101n. And at this day when the insignificant well-wisher, Ab\u016b'l-fa\u1e63l, is writing this noble volume with a pen perfumed with sincerity, Fateh Kh\u0101n is in the service of His Majesty the Shahinsh\u0101h and reckoned among the especial huntsmen. His Majesty who always dressed himself in outward disguises, and clothed himself in other garb, and kept his splendour hidden under various veils, made another screen for his beauty by his regard for this strange animal. But the rays of the sun and the fragrance of musk cannot be hid. On that day when fortune drew me to learn wisdom and to beatitude, and when by having the blessing of service, I became cognisant of the perfections of this chosen one of God, what prostrations of thanksgiving did I not perform, and what successes did I not obtain from this auspicious service! I was exalted spiritually and temporally, and I cleansed the chamber of my heart from superfluous desires. Now that the time of thanksgiving has arrived and that I wish to record my impressions\u2014so that I may both give thanks and that a lamp of vision may be put in the path of the walkers in darkness, I am unaffectedly disturbed by the fact that I am in service and that there is a commercial nexus. Would that I had no outward acquaintance (with Akbar), and that I were not in the list of visible servants! so that the outwardly-seeing but inwardly-blind might not reckon this individual among the crowd of flatterers, and that men might, through my apparent exclusion be led to the goal and attain felicity. Good God! panegyrics have been written of old about ascetics who had not a tithe of the tenth part of the excellencies of this Khedive of the Age, nay, many of them had naught but external semblance, and yet, because there was no reciprocity in the matter, men void of insight imagine that these are not flatteries but are representations of the truth! But now, at this day, when the story of the Leader (p\u0113d\u0101w\u0101) of mankind, whether\n\n1 Hussain Quli, Blochmann, 329.\n2 Blochmann, 528.\nspiritual or temporal, is about to be told, I who have tracked the spirit of the age must bear on my heart's shoulder the burden of men's ill-understanding! But forasmuch as my first thought was to pay in some small measure my debt of gratitude, I am not saddened by this man-troubling burden (b\u0101r-i-mardam\u0101z\u0101r). And wherefore should I be? And now rejoicing in my good intention I pass on as a swift nocturnal linkman! Many have gained the Truth and ta'en the highway of loyalty! I now leave this subject, to which there is no end, and return to the point in my narrative where I was.\n\nIn fine, His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b waged a masterly war for about forty\\(^1\\) days, and by taking thought, and by making preparations gave support to the hearts of the loyal and enabled them to adorn the field of battle. At length, on 2nd Sh'ab\u0101n of the year in question (962), 22nd June, 1555, which was the watch-day (naubat-i-taraddad)\\(^2\\) of the servants of His Majesty the Shahinsh\u0101h Khw\u0101ja Mu'azzam, Atka Kh\u0101n and others went forth and did manfully. On the other side K\u0101l\u0101 Pah\u0101r, brother of Iskandar, came forward and fought. Though it had not been intended that on that day there should be a general engagement, yet as something was to emerge from the curtain of fate, gradually the flames of conflict burst forth and rose high. The victorious troops advanced from all sides and steadily took post, so that there was a glorious battle-array.\n\n**Verse.**\n\nTwo iron mountains moved from their places,\nYou'd say earth was moved from top to bottom,\nTwo armies drew their poniards in front of each other,\nThe centre and wings were drawn up in line,\nThe rush of arrows and the clash of swords,\nTore the marrow of elephants and the entrails (zehra, lit., gall-bladder)\\(^3\\) of tigers.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Hum\u0101y\u016bn had been less than thirty days at Sihriind for he arrived there on the night of 7th Rajab.\n\n\\(^2\\) I am not sure of the meaning of the word taraddad here. It usually means reiteration or returning Naubat means relieving guard. Apparently the meaning here is that the duty of keeping guard was with Akbar's division on that day. See Bad\u0101\u016bn\u012b I. 460 who uses the word yasak.\n\n\\(^3\\) The gall-bladder is supposed to be the seat of courage, and Jah\u0101ng\u012br\nBy the auspicious influence of the fortune of His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, a great victory was gained, and much booty fell into the hands of the imperial servants. A large number of the luckless foe went to the world of non-existence. Sikandar went off with his men to the D\u0101man-i-k\u014dh of the Panj\u0101b. Khw\u0101ja Mus\u0101fir\u012b,\u00b9 one of the gallant men, came in his path. When Sikandar saw that a man was going to attack him, he turned, but though he put his hand to his sword, he could not draw it. After many attempts he disengaged himself from him and came away from that dangerous place. What else but this can happen to those intoxicated with the world and proud of their glory? His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b in the midst of the worldly success, which is a wine that overthrows men, was wise and made supplications to God. And he conducted himself with perfect wisdom towards all classes. What marvel then that he was successful! Obedience to wisdom the Sult\u0101n (Sult\u0101n-i-khird) fits the work to the desire. Firstly; it makes the intention good. Secondly; effort is made in work suitable to one\u2019s condition. Thirdly; when good results are obtained the credit of them is not given to oneself. And no author is recognised except the omnipotent God. In fine His Majesty in order to teach the superficial, and in order to show respect to the various degrees of supplication, did not confine himself to inward thanksgiving, but had recourse to external acts, and prostrated himself in prayer to God. Though when India was last conquered, the victory of His Majesty Giti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-mak\u0101n\u012b was a masterpiece, as has been already described, yet the wise and acute know that it was not like this present marvel. In fact\u00b2 there have been few instances in past times of such a victory as this which was obtained by few against many and which came solely from the great throne of God. Just at the time of this victory there was an excessive storm of wind and rain. As this caused the destruction of a number of oppressors and ingrates, it may be regarded as belonging\n\n\u00b9 Apparently this is the B\u0101b\u0101 Dost Khw\u0101ja Kh\u0101j\u012br Mu\u1e63\u0101fir\u012b mentioned by Bay\u0101z\u012bd at p. 82a as taking part afterwards in the defence of K\u0101bul.\n\n\u00b2 See translation, supra, p. 246. The account given in the present chapter about the battle\u2019s being fought on the day assigned to Akbar\u2019s division explains the expression at p. 246 about the blessing of Akbar\u2019s personality.\nto the successes of the servants of the State, and as a mark of the destruction of the contumacious. But as it prevented a pursuit of the fugitives and gave them after a thousand agonies a release from danger it may be regarded as a respite to an ill-fated crew.\n\nWhen by Divine aid such a great gift had been revealed, His Majesty sat on the throne of justice and appraised the services of the loyal and devoted. In order to bring out the jewel of the sincere from the potsherd of service-sellers the question arose, in whose name should the proclamation of victory be recorded? An order was given that everyone should lay in his claim. Sh\u0101h Ab\u016b\u2019l-ma\u02bf\u0101li, who was drunk with the wine of negligence, wished that the record of the glorious victory should be in his name. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n who was conscious that the coming to India was by his exertions, and who, up to the time of the victory, had, in opposition to a crowd of men, supported the world-adorning views of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b and had conducted the conquest of the countries and the uprooting of foes, was keenly desirous that the proclamation should bear his name. The farseeing and wise who knew that the victory was due to the felicity of His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h and nursling of Divine light, opened their eyes and ears in surprised contemplation of the speakers, and the experienced and the just, knowing that this great victory which had shed its rays on the day assigned to the watch (naubat-i-mans\u016bb\u0101n) of the light of the garden of the khil\u0101fat was due to the presence of his Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h, were astonished at the utterances of those men (Ab\u016b\u2019l-ma\u02bf\u0101li and Bair\u0101m). At last, His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b became by inspiration cognisant of the truth, and ordered the victory to be inscribed in the name of His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h and thereby gratified the loyal far and near.\n\nOne of the strange occurrences of this time was the arrest of Khw\u0101ja Mu\u02bfazzam. The brief account is that a letter containing some lines by the Khw\u0101ja came to hand. In his contemptible understanding and wickedness, he had written improper things to Sikandar and had represented himself as his well-wisher. His Majesty was greatly surprised and called upon the Khw\u0101ja for an explanation. As he could not deny, he said\u00b9 that his well-wishing (daulat-khw\u0101hi)\n\n\u00b9 Apparently he maintained that the expressions in the letter about loyalty referred to Hum\u0101y\u016bn and not to Sikandar. Price in his Retrospect gives a different rendering. His view is that Mu\u02bfazzam said he\na number of Afgh\u0101ns came out of His\u0101r and prepared to fight. Though the Afgh\u0101ns were nearly 2,000 in number and the royal servants about 400, a great engagement took place and by Divine help the victory was gained, and seventy of the enemy were killed. Rustam Kh\u0101n fled and strengthened the fort of His\u0101r. The contenders of fortune besieged it for twenty-three days. When Rustam found himself in difficulties he came to terms. He was sent to Court along with about 700 men of note in the charge of Mir La\u1e6dif and Khw\u0101ja Q\u0101sim Makhlas, and he did homage along with many others. After some time an order was given that he should get a proper j\u0101g\u012br, but on the condition that his sons should be guarded in Bikr\u0101m in order that they might enter on the path of favour and also that the road of vigilance and caution might not be abandoned. That simpleton rejected this condition, which was a means of confirming his obedience, and was about to abscond. When this was found out, he was imprisoned and committed to the charge of Beg Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24shak \u0100q\u0101.\n\nOne of the occurrences of this time was the affair of Qambar Diw\u0101na. The short account is that he was one of the common men or rather of the unknown men of the camp. When after the victory of Sihrind, the royal standards went on to Delhi, this Qambar gathered together a number of his own set of vagabonds and indulged in plunder and rapine. Booty was continually coming into his hands, and was distributed by him, and out of cunning, he was continually sending petitions to the Court. Proceeding from Sihrind he went fighting on and got possession of Sambal. There he established himself and sent his adopted son, who had received the name of \u2018\u0100rifu-l-l\u0101h to Bud\u0101\u014dn. Rai \u1e24usain Jalw\u0101n\u012b, who was a leading officer among the Afgh\u0101ns, was there and was got rid of without a struggle. From there Qambar \u2018Ali went on to K\u0101nt Gola\u00b9 and devastated that country. There he fought an irregular (bituzuk\u0101na, without method) battle with Rukn Kh\u0101n a leading Afgh\u0101n and was defeated. From there he came to Bud\u0101\u014dn. Though this madman was always sending petitions and making representations of obedience and good\n\n\u00b9 K\u0101nt o Gola, Blochmann 373. They are in Rohilkand, and nearly correspond to Shahjah\u0101np\u016br. Elliot V. 498 note, and his Supp. Glossary II. 167.\nservice, his words and his deeds did not agree. He extended his foot beyond his carpet and made men Kh\u0101ns and Sult\u0101ns of his own motion, and gave them standards and drums! Frenzy took possession of him and often from madness or assumed madness and fraud, he gave up his own house to be plundered. There continually appeared in him irregular proceedings which were allied to madness. When then facts repeatedly came to the notice of His Majesty he issued an order to \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n Shai'b\u0101ni to send him to Court, and to punish him if he resisted. Just when the madman, having been defeated by Rukn Kh\u0101n, had come to Bud\u0101\u014dn, \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n after having settled the affairs of Mirat came to Sambal. After arranging matters there he came to Bud\u0101\u014dn. Though he sent a person to call him, Qambar did not appear, and said \u201cJust as you are a slave of the king, so am I one of the office-bearers of the expedition, and I have got this province by the sword.\u201d At last \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n took to arms and when Qambar was defeated, he took refuge in the fort of Bud\u0101\u014dn, and sent a petition to Court. When His Majesty got this account of him, he sent Q\u0101sim Makhla\u1e63 to encompass him with favours and to bring him to kiss the threshold. Before Q\u0101sim had reached Bud\u0101\u014dn, and brought this message of deliverance, \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n had killed him. The short account of this is that when Qambar strengthened the fort, and the siege was being protracted, \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n sent to him Mu\u1e25ammad Beg Turkam\u0101n and Mull\u0101 Ghi\u1e63gu-d-d\u012bn. He imprisoned these envoys, and they secretly won over a number of people to their side and having by craft overcome the garrison, they made Qambar a prisoner. \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n sent his head to Court. The just heart of the king was grieved at this and he sent a firm\u0101n of rebuke to \u2018Ali Quli Kh\u0101n. He asked why he went to war when he (Qambar) was making proffers of obedience and wished to submit, and why did he kill him without orders after getting him into his power? His Majesty repeatedly said to those near him that he had wished to see this man and that if he had found on the tablet of his forehead truth and rectitude, he would have shown him favour and have educated him.\n\nOne of the occurrences of this time was the ingratitude of M. Sulaim\u0101n. The brief account of this is that when the royal standards went off to India, Tard\u012b Beg Kh\u0101n, who held Andar\u0101b and Ishkamish in his j\u0101g\u012br, was ordered to join. Muq\u012bm Kh\u0101n remained behind\nto look after the j\u0101g\u012br. M. Sulaim\u0101n thought this a good opportunity to get hold of the territories. First, he tried craft, and sought to win over Muq\u012bm Kh\u0101n to his side. When this failed, the M\u012brz\u0101 threw off the mask and besieged Andar\u0101b. Muq\u012bm Kh\u0101n was compelled to come out with his family, and by fighting his way through he got away from that dangerous spot and came to K\u0101bul. One of the occurrences of this time was the killing by \u1e24aidar Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n Akhta Beg\u012b of Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n\u00b9 the father of that Ibr\u0101h\u012bm who had had an itching desire for a throne. The story is as follows: When \u1e24aidar Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n was sent to B\u012bs\u0101na, Gh\u0101zi Kh\u0101n, who was the governor, could not resist and took refuge in the fort. Relying upon the promises and engagements which were held out by \u1e24aidar Mu\u1e25ammad, he came out; but \u1e24aidar Mu\u1e25ammad fixed his eyes on his goods and chattels and broke his promise, and put him to death with the sword of injustice. When His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b heard of this, it did not commend itself to his just mind. As he (i.e., Hum\u0101y\u016bn) was at a distance, and had only recently come to India he ostensibly refrained from inflicting punishment on him but he announced that \u1e24aidar would never again bind\u00b2 on his belt. And in truth what the fate-interpreting tongue had uttered remained in force till he left this world. Shihsbu-d-d\u012bn A\u1e25mad Kh\u0101n who was the M\u012br Biy\u016bt\u0101t (i.e., officer in charge of buildings, &c.), was sent to inquire into the matter and to appraise the property. His Majesty went on, in ways well-pleasing to God, in taking care of his subjects, in building up the world, and in giving repose to mankind.\n\n\u00b9 In B.M. Add. 27,247 the words are differently and more grammatically arranged. The Ibr\u0101h\u012bm here referred to is the Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Kh\u0101n S\u0101r who is described in text p. 339 as having contended for the throne of India with Sikandar and as having been defeated by him near Agra.\n\n\u00b2 Apparently the prophecy was that his arm would wither. Bay\u0101z\u012bd tells us that \u1e24aidar's arm became useless. Perhaps this was ascribed to Hum\u0101y\u016bn's prophecy or curse, but Bay\u0101z\u012bd says it was in consequence of a wound that he received in Afghanistan. It seems that Hum\u0101y\u016bn was regarded as one who had the power of imprecating disaster on those who had offended him. Another instance is given by Jauhar and Gulbadan Begam as having occurred in Sind.\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nEXPEDITION OF HIS MAJESTY THE SHAHINSHAH TO THE PANJAB IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY JAHANBANI JINNAT ASHAYANI.\n\nDuring this time that the world-conquering soul of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b was managing with justice the territories of India, unpleasant reports about Sh\u0101h Ab\u016b-l-Ma\u02bf\u0101li came to the effect that being intoxicated with the harmful wine of the world he was troubling the people, and was conducting himself in ways contrary to the king's commands. As His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b had a special regard for him he considered such reports as contrary to the truth and as inventions of the envious and malignant. But at length it was noised in the royal camp that Sikandar had come out from the hills and it became certain that this infatuated Sayyids\u0101da had without authority severed Far\u1e25at Kh\u0101n from the governorship of Lahore and had appointed one of his own creatures in his room. Also that he was laying hands on the royal treasure. By Divine inspiration the resolution became fixed in His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b's holy soul, which was a mirror showing what was right for country and empire, that the Panj\u0101b, which is one of the great provinces of India, should be made illustrious by the blessing of the protection and government of His Majesty the Shahinshah, and that, if it seemed proper, Ab\u016b-l-Ma\u02bf\u0101li should have \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r\u00b9 and its neighbourhood. Moreover as he was sending about this time for the chaste ladies from K\u0101bul it was right that the Panj\u0101b should be in the possession of His Majesty\n\n\u00b9 \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r, we are told in the previous chapter, had been conferred on Akbar, and the meaning apparently is that if Akbar (and Bair\u0101m) thought proper, \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r might now be given to Ab\u016b-l-Ma\u02bf\u0101li, in exchange for the Panj\u0101b.\nthe Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h\u2019s servants. Though the army was large enough to quell Sikandar yet for political and personal reasons the name \u201cauxiliary\u201d was used. In the beginning of the year 963, November, 1555, in an auspicious hour which befitted the accession to the throne of the seven climes, His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h the Divine nursling was appointed (to the Panj\u0101b) according to the rules of sovereignty and splendour. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n was nominally appointed as guardian of His Highness, but in fact the education of that support of dominion was committed to the fortunate auspices of His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h. A number of loyal and faithful followers attended on his stirrup.\n\nWhen they arrived at Sihrind the royal servants who were in \u1e24i\u1e63\u0101r Fir\u016bza obtained the blessing of service and were delighted. In that auspicious station Ust\u0101d \u2018Az\u012bz Sist\u0101n\u012b who for his good service and loyalty had received the title of R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n\u00b9 and had no equal in pyrotechny and in shooting with guns had the felicity of entering the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h\u2019s service. It was here that his shooting began and in a short time he became a master in this strange craft, just as he is a master in every act and science. And wondrous masterpieces, such that volumes could not contain the accounts of them, were displayed by this exhibitor of perfections in this as in other acts. What shall I say or what shall I write about the totality of this holy personality? For without exception when any person who shall have studied some particular art or science, whether with mature scientists, or with master craftsmen, and whether in whole or in part, and have acquired practice therein by studying for years with able teachers enters the service of this scrutinising intellect and universal genius, he gets lost in contemplating his abundant knowledge and is struck with astonishment. And he thinks to himself that apparently His Majesty has spent all his time in nothing but this art. But afterwards he says no one could acquire such skill, it must be the gift of God! And one of the wonderful things is that he enters into contradictory dispositions and varied characters in one and the same seance, for this is not difficult to the world-adorning mind. What capacity have philosophers, or learned men,\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps the R\u016bm\u012b Kh\u0101n Hal\u0101b\u012b, i.e., of Aleppo, mentioned in Blochmann 441.\nor artists to keep his company except for a time and on their own subject? Such lofty understanding and such wide intelligence are not within human powers. Rather the power of an angel would not suffice. May Almighty God long preserve this glorious pearl for the alignment (intiz\u0101m) of mortals!\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nBRIEF ACCOUNT OF HIS MAJESTY JAHANB\u00c2NI JAINNAT \u00c2SHAY\u00c2NI, AND DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF HIS REMARKABLE INVENTIONS AND REGULATIONS.\n\nAs the affairs of the Panj\u00e2b had been happily arranged by the expedition of His Majesty the Sh\u00e2h\u00eensh\u00e2h there, His Majesty Jah\u00e2nb\u00e2ni remained in Delhi and employed himself in the work of political administration. He gave his attention to the reconstruction of the territories, the extirpation of enemies and the conquest of other provinces. He repeatedly said that he would make several seats of government, and labour for the regulation of India. Delhi, Agra, Jaunp\u00fbr, M\u00e2nd\u00fb, Lahore, Qanauj and other suitable places would be chosen and in every place there would be an army under the charge of a prudent, farseeing, subject-cherishing, and just officer, so that there should be no need then for an auxiliary force. And he would not keep more than 12,000 horse attached to his own person. He also used to say that he would have embroidered gold and silver seats prepared to be used in the public assemblies by the princes and by such men of his entourage as were to be exalted by special honour so that they might sit upon them when an order to that effect was given. For it was likely that the affections of the great and worldly, who had not reached the palace of loyalty but still remained in the bazar of traffic, and of loss and gain, would not be captured merely by gifts of property, and that until their honour and prestige were increased they would not be won over.\n\nFrom the beginning of his career till now his mind was exercised in strange inventions and in showing forth recondite truths. Among these was this that at the time when His Majesty G\u00eati Sit\u00e2ni Fird\u00fbs Mak\u00e2ni proceeded from Kabul to Qandah\u00e2r he left His Majesty Jah\u00e2nb\u00e2ni in K\u00e2bul to look after affairs. One day His Majesty was riding in the environs of the city and exploring the plains and\nmeadows. On the way he said to Maul\u0101n\u0101 R\u016bh Ull\u0101h, who was his teacher, \"it has occurred to me to take an augury from the names of three persons whom I may find on the road, and I shall build the foundations of my dominion (daulat) thereon.\" The Maul\u0101n\u0101 said the name of one person would be enough. He replied \"A secret inspiration has communicated itself to me.\" After going a little distance a wayfarer of mature age appeared and when they asked him his name, he replied \"Mur\u0101d Khw\u0101ja.\" After him another man appeared who was driving an ass loaded with wood. When they asked him his name he said \"Daulat Khw\u0101ja.\" Upon this the inspired tongue (of Hum\u0101y\u016bn) said that \"if the name of the next person that comes be S\u0101d\u0101t Khw\u0101ja it will be a strange and beautiful coincidence, and the star of joy (mur\u0101d) will ascend from the horizon of auspiciousness (sa\u02bf\u0101dat).\" At that very moment a man (a boy, in Khw\u0101ndam\u012br's account) appeared, who was grazing some cattle, and when they asked him what his name was he replied \"S\u0101d\u0101t Khw\u0101ja.\" The servants in attendance were astonished at this marvel, and all felt assured that the lord of auspicious fortune would by Divine favour attain to lofty rank and become possessed of dominion.\n\nWhen these mysterious glad tidings were fulfilled and the rose garden of hope was made fresh and verdant by the stream of justice he founded his affairs, sacred and secular on joy (mur\u0101d), dominion (daulat) and auspiciousness (sa\u02bf\u0101dat). And he divided all the servants of the fortunate threshold, or rather all the inhabitants of his dominions into three classes. He called his brothers, and other relatives, his officers, his viziers, and all his soldiers Ahl-i-daulat. For it was clear that without the help of this body of men the ladder of dominion and fortune could not be climbed. He called the philosophers, the \u1e0d\u016blam\u0101, the chancellors (\u1e63ad\u016br), the sayyids, the shaikhs, the Q\u016bz\u012bs, the poets and the other learned men, the judges, nobles and skilful persons Ahl-i-sa\u02bf\u0101dat, because the honouring of these auspicious persons, and the association with them were a means of gaining everlasting auspiciousness. He called architects, painters,\n\n---\n\n1 This story is given in Elliot V. 118 and 236 who remarks that it first appears in Khw\u0101ndam\u012br. Ni\u1e93\u0101mu-d-d\u012bn and Fer\u012bghta assign it to the period just before Hum\u0101y\u016bn's conquest of India. Khw\u0101ndam\u012br calls the teacher Mas\u1e25\u016bd-d-d\u012bn R\u016bh\u016blla.\nmusicians and singers. Ahl-i-mur\u0101d, because they were the delight of all the world. Similarly he divided the days of the week among the Ahl-i-daulat, sa\u02bf\u0101dat and mur\u0101d, to wit, Saturday and Thursday belonged to Ahl-i-sa\u02bf\u0101dat, and on these two days his attention was given to the regulators of knowledge and devotion. The reason of appropriating those two days to the Ahl-i-sa\u02bf\u0101dat was that Saturday is assigned to Saturn, and Saturn is the patron of shai\u1e25s and ancient families. Thursday is Jupiter's day, and that is the star of learned men and of other noble orders. Sunday and Tuesday were assigned to the Ahl-i-daulat, and on them, royal affairs, and the management of world-government were transacted. The reason for thus assigning these two days was that Sunday appertains to the sun whose rays regulate rule and sovereignty, while Tuesday is Mars's day and Mars is the patron of soldiers. Monday and Tuesday were days of joy (mur\u0101d). On these days boon-companions and favourites and others of the Ahl-i-mur\u0101d were treated with special favour. The point in selecting these two days was that Monday is the Moon's day, and Wednesday is Mercury's. Both of these have a special connection with household matters (am\u016br-i-biy\u0101tat). Friday (jam\u02bfa), in accordance with its name, applied to all objects, and on it all the classes of humanity participated in the royal bounty.\n\nOne of the arrangements which characterised the div\u0101n-days was that when the throne of the khil\u0101fat was set up and His Majesty being seated thereon was advising the Div\u0101n, information was given to the people by beat of drum, and when he left the Div\u0101n, cannoniers announced the fact to the subjects by the discharge of cannon. And on these days keepers of the wardrobe\u00b9 would bring several suits of apparel, (dast-i-khel\u0101t), and the treasurers several bags of gold near to the palace, so that their might be no stoppage to the gifts and largesses. Several brave men stood armed, and with cuirasses on their breasts.\n\nAnother of his inventions was that of three golden arrows which were an allusion to the three divisions\u00b2 of sa\u02bf\u0101dat, daulat and mur\u0101d. Each of these was assigned to one of the leaders of the three classes in order that he should supervise the works thereof. And it was provided that so long as each of the holders of these arrows\n\n\u00b9 Kark\u012br\u0101q\u010di\u0101n, Blochmann 87 n. 2\n\u00b2 Sahm which means both a division or segment, and an arrow.\nexerted himself in the management of the duties appertaining to that division (sahm), which consisted in acting according to the will of God and in loyalty, he should be the subject of favour and should be secure on the masnad of authority. But if ever he should become intoxicated by the wine of grandeur and transgress the path of justice, or from some evil motive should avert his eyes from loyalty, and should restrict his zeal to the acquisition of wealth, the arrow of his design would not reach the target of success and the writing of deposition would be drawn on the page of his condition, and he would meet with a fitting retribution. Mir Khw\u0101nd the chief chronicler (Mir Muwarrikh) has recorded in his Q\u0101n\u016bn-i-hum\u0101y\u016bn\u012b that in the time of his service the arrow of sa\u02bf\u0101dat was entrusted with absolute authority to the most excellent of the masters of learning and perfection\u2014Maul\u0101n\u0101 Farghali; and the opening and shutting, the contraction and expansion, of the affairs of Sayyids, Shaikhs, \u2018Ulam\u0101, Q\u0101z\u012bs, and teachers, and the inquiry into the claims of ecclesiastics (arb\u0101b-i-\u02bfam\u0101\u02beim, lit. wearers of large turbans), and the appointment and removal of those entrusted with the works of religion, and the assignment of stipends and siy\u0101rgh\u0101ls were all in his charge. The arrow of daulat was with the prop of sovereignty\u2014\u0100mir Hind\u016b Beg, and the shutting and opening, the binding and unloosing of the great affairs of the officers and viziers, and of all the government-clerks, and those entrusted with civil affairs, and the fixing of the pay of the soldiers, and the appointment of the household servants rested with him. The arrow of mur\u0101d and of the works of architecture was assigned to Amir Waisi. He had to look after the buildings and the arrangement of matters of pomp and pageantry and to care for the perfecting of the things of splendour and glory.\n\nAnother of his inventions was the distribution of arrows into twelve classes. Each order of men was assigned to an arrow. The arrangement was as follows: The twelfth arrow, which was of the finest gold, was reserved for the royal quiver, i.e., for Hum\u0101y\u016bn and Akbar. The eleventh was for the brothers and other kinsmen and such of the sons of kings as were servants of the threshold of dominion. The tenth arrow was for the Sayyids, the Shaikhs, and the\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. Elliot V. 116 and B.M. MS.

This expression is often used for civilians or laymen attached to an army, such as shopkeepers, citizens, and the like.\n\nKhwandam\u012br has the word darb\u0101n\u0101n but he has not the word p\u0101s\u0101n\u0101n. Instead of p\u0101s\u0101n\u0101n he has s\u0101rb\u0101n\u0101n. See B.M. MSS. Or. 1762, p. 133 and Or. 5850, p. 196. The pages which should contain the account of the arrows are wanting in the translation in the B.M. MS. Add. 30774. There is a gap after p. 76 or 49b. A note at the end of Or. 5850 makes the curious mis-statement that the work is by Gulbadan Begam!\neach of these four departments a vizier was appointed. The artiller and the arrangements of armour and arms and of other things with which fire had to do were called the Fire Department. Khw\u0101ja 'Abdu l-Mulk was appointed to be vizier of it. The wardrobe (karq\u012br\u0101qkh\u0101na), the kitchen, the stable, and the necessary management of the mules and camels was called the Air Department. The charge of it was given to Khw\u0101ja Lat\u012bf Ull\u0101h. The arrangements of the Sharbatkh\u0101na, the wine-cellar (s\u0101cikkh\u0101na), and of canals was called the Water Department. Khw\u0101ja Hasan was appointed the vizier thereof. The affairs of agriculture and of buildings and the administration of exchequer-lands (\u1e63ab\u1e6d-i-kh\u0101li\u1e63\u0101t) and of some of the buildings (biy\u016bl\u0101t) were called the Earth Department. The vizier was Khw\u0101ja Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn M\u012brz\u0101 Beg. In every one of the departments one of the Am\u012brs was employed. For instance, Am\u012br N\u0101\u1e63ir Qul\u012b was the M\u012br Sark\u0101r, or head-officer, of the Fire Department and always wore red.\n\nAnother of the inventions of this time was that four large barges were set in the river Jam\u016bna (Jumna) and that the master-carpenters constructed on each of them a c\u0101rt\u0101q (a square house) of two storeys and of very elegant shape. The barges were so joined together that the c\u0101rt\u0101qs faced one another. Between every two of these four barges another t\u0101q (platform) was made and thus there appeared an octagonal reservoir between the barges.\n\n1 *Im\u0101r\u0101t.* Perhaps the word here means colonization or the settling of ryots, for we have buildings (biy\u016bl\u0101t) mentioned immediately afterwards.\n\n2 The text says that the carpenters made the barges too, but I presume that the skill of the ust\u0101d\u0101n-i-na\u1e63\u012br was chiefly shown in constructing the houses upon them. The c\u0101rt\u0101qs are perhaps square buildings or they may be buildings with four pillars, see Vullers s.v. c\u0101rt\u0101q. But, as Quatrem\u00e8re points out N. and E., XIV. 498, the word c\u0101r, four, is often vaguely used.\n\n3 Lit. were by the field of power made into fact. A.F. has been simply copying Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, and I confess I do not fully understand the description, or how the tank or reservoir was octagonal. I suppose, however, that the four barges formed a square and that the space between them, which was probably planked over, made a portion of the river into a tank. The corresponding passage of Khw\u0101ndam\u012br is thus translated by Mu\u1e25\u1e63\u012b Sadas\u016bk L\u0101l, p. 90, of B.M. MS. Add. 30, 774:\n\n\"The four boats which, according to royal directions, were made by the most clever carpenters in the water of the Jumna. In each of these boats there was made a large room...\"\nAnother of his excellent inventions was his arrangement of shops and the putting up of a bazar on boats. This increased the amazement of the rare of intellect. In the year 939, 1532-33, when His Majesty went from Firuzabad-i-Dihli (i.e., Delhi) to Agra, the capital, by way of the river, and was accompanied by most of the Amirs and pillars of the State and all the \u012bk\u1e63\u0101n\u00b9 and officers, a bazar of this kind was made and carried down the Jamun\u0101. Everyone could get what he wanted in that bazar.\n\nIn like manner the royal gardeners made, in accordance with orders, a garden on the river.\n\nAnother of his inventions was a movable\u00b2 bridge.\n\nAnother of his wonderful inventions was a movable palace. This palace was composed of three storeys which were of cut beams. The master-carpenters had so joined the pieces together that whoever looked at them thought that the whole was of one piece. Whenever they wanted they could take it to pieces and convey it to any country. And the ladders (or steps) to the upper storey were so constructed that they could be opened out or shut up at pleasure.\n\nOne of the wonderful inventions of that holy mind was a cap (t\u0101j) which was alike magnificent and agreeable to wear. The border (or margin) which went round the t\u0101j had two divisions (furja), and each of these was in the form of the figure seven (V), and thus by there being two figures 7 (VV) the number 77 was produced, which\n\n(having four doors or pillars) of two storeys exceedingly nice. The boats were joined together in such a manner that the four apartments stood opposite each other, and by the junction of each two boats another apartment was produced and between all the four a figure resembling a reservoir of octagonal form was made.\"\n\nPrice says: \"The four vessels were connected by a strong platform or some species of gallery in such a manner that the pavilions were placed in a situation exactly opposite to each other, perhaps in the form of a lozenge, and between each of the vessels was interposed an additional pavilion, making altogether the number of eight and forming in the centre of the whole a beautiful tank or pond of water of eight sides.\"\n\n\u00b9 This is the word \u0101nkac\u0101n already referred to. Possibly it may be here a mistake for b\u012blikc\u0101n or writers.\n\n\u00b2 This is described at length by Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, p. 139a, of Persian text and 112 of translation. It is perhaps characteristic of A.F. that this, perhaps, the only really useful work of Humay\u016bn, is left undescribed by him.\nwas the numerical value of the word 'izz. Here it was called the t\u0101j-i-'issat or cap of honour. This was invented in Badakhsh\u0101n\u00b9 and 381 when His Majesty came to Agra and appeared before His Majesty G\u0113t\u012b Sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs Mak\u0101n\u012b the latter was much pleased.\n\nAnother of his inventions was a tent (khirg\u0101) which had twelve partitions corresponding to the signs of the Zodiac. Each mansion (b\u016br\u016b) had lattices (pinjara\u1e25\u0101)\u00b2 through the interstices of which there shone the light of the stars of dominion. And there was another tent\u00b3 which was like the Heaven of Heavens which encompasses the heaven of the fixed stars. This surrounded the other tents and as the crystalline sphere (i.e., the Heaven of Heavens) is undotted (with stars) so this tent was without lattices.\n\nOne of his pleasure-increasing inventions was the \"carpet of mirth\" (bas\u012bf-i-nis\u0101d\u0101t). This was a round carpet corresponding to the orbits of the spheres and the elemental spheres. The first circle which corresponded to the crystalline sphere was white, the second blue (kab\u0101d), the third black, like Saturn, the fourth, which was the house of Jupiter, was light brown (sandali), the fifth, which was related to Mars, was ruby-coloured, the sixth, which was the house of the Sun, was golden, the seventh, which was the house of Venus, was bright green, the eighth, which was the station of petty tents and took them within itself like a cover. Like the crystalline sphere, on which there are no spots of the fixed stars and the planets, this had also no lattice or balcony round it.\" Khw\u0101ndam\u012br explains that the outer tent was distinct from the inner one and could be used separately. The inner tent which represented the twelve signs of the Zodiac was perhaps the tent mentioned by Gulbadan Begam and called by her mihr-\u0101mis, i.e., associated with the sun. The word which Sad\u0101s\u012bk L\u0101l has translated balcony is qan'\u0101d\u0101t, so perhaps the outer tent had no flaps or side-walls.\n\n\u00b9 The t\u0101j-i-'issat according to Khw\u0101ndam\u012br was not used only by Hum\u0101y\u016bn, but was for the nobles also. Only Hum\u0101y\u016bn's was all of one colour, whereas their's were of several colours. He may have invented it in Badakhsh\u0101n, but the chronogram of its construction, t\u0101j-i-'issat, given by Khw\u0101ndam\u012br yields 939, or two years after B\u0101bar's death.\n\n\u00b2 Blochmann 225, account of pinjara\u1e25\u0101s, or lattice-work.\n\n\u00b3 Khw\u0101ndam\u012br's description is at p. 122 of translation and 140 of Persian text. \"A large tent which like the empyrean heaven that covers the inferior ones surrounded all the\nMercury, was bluish (s\u0101san\u012b, i.e., lily, or iris-coloured). For the nature of Mercury is composite and when blue and rose are mixed the result is s\u0101san\u012b. And the reason why s\u0101san\u012b was chosen in preference to other colours was that several philosophers have called the colour of Mercury that of collyrium (ku\u1e0d\u0101), and the s\u0101san\u012b is nearer to collyrium than other mixed colours are. The ninth circle, which was the station of the Moon, was white. After the circle of the Moon came the region (kura, i.e., globe or sphere) of fire and air, then that of earth and water. The inhabited quarter of the earth was divided into seven climes. He himself occupied the golden circle (i.e., the one consecrated to the Sun) and there he adorned the throne of the khilafat. Each section (or group) was ordered to sit in accordance with the one of the seven planets which was appropriate to it in the circle which corresponded therewith. Thus, the Indian officers sat in the circle of Saturn, while the Sayyids and the \u2018Ulam\u0101 sat in the circle of Jupiter. The persons who occupied each circle made use of dice, on each side of which there was represented a human figure in a different position. According to each one\u2019s throw he assumed a position which corresponded to the figure that turned up. For example, if a standing figure turned up he stood, if a seated, he sat down, and if a reclining one he lay down. This was a means of increasing mirth.\n\nAnother of his excellent devices was the wearing of clothes each day corresponding to the colour of the planet of that day. Thus on Sunday he wore a yellow robe, which is the colour appropriated to the Sun, who is the regent thereof. On Monday he wore\n\n---\n\n1 Perhaps some will think that Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s courtiers, like Mr. Peter Magnus\u2019 friends, were easily amused. This carpet is described by Khw\u0101ndam\u012br, Persian text 155, translation 206: It appears to have been of enormous size, for, he says, that each of the seven circles had 200 grades (?) so that in all 1,400 persons could sit in it. The bright green, sabz-e-gh\u0101n, which is given as the colour of the circle of Venus, is said in the dictionaries to be the name of a kind of pigeon. Blochmann, pp. 294, 299, renders sabz by \u201cbluish.\u201d Sadas\u0101k L\u0101l renders s\u0101san\u012b by violet. The expression umr\u0101-i-Hind\u012b used with reference to the circle of Saturn means Indian-born officers whether Hindus or Mu\u1e25ammadans, for Khw\u0101ndam\u012br says that the Mughal also sat there.\n\n2 Khw\u0101ndam\u012br says that when the moon was near the full Hum\u0101y\u016bn wore white.\ngreen, which is appropriate to the Moon, and so on. Another of his inventions was the drum\\(^1\\) of justice. If the claim of anyone related to some dispute he beat the drum once. If his grievance consisted in the non-receipt of stipend, or wages he struck twice. If his goods and chattels (m\u0101l-u-jih\u0101t) had been seized by oppression, or had been stolen, he complained by beating the drum thrice. If he had a claim of blood against anyone he beat the drum loudly four times.\n\nThe notes of the inventive genius of this khedive of holy type are many, but the above are enough to enable the understanding and the acute to comprehend the rare jewels of his soul. It is now better to abridge words and to come to the proper subject.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This is an institution as old as N\u016bshirw\u0101n. Khw\u0101nd\u0101mir makes the next sentence more intelligible by prefixing the word andak small to the word m\u0101h\u0101gamat, dispute or suit. In the Lucknow Museum there are a number of large drums which came from Agra, and are said to belong to Akbar's time. Perhaps they are the remains of one of Hum\u0101y\u016bn's institutions.\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nINCIDENCE OF A FLASH OF INDICATION OF A JOURNEY TO THE WORLD OF HOLINESS ON THE INWARD MIRROR OF HIS MAJESTY JAHANBANI JINNAT ASHIYANI, AND HIS DEPARTURE FOR THAT WORLD.\n\nLet it not be concealed from inquiring minds that at about the time when His Majesty the Shahinshah, the young shoot of the parterre of insight, obtained leave to go to the Panjab, there frequently rose on the lips of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b Jinnat Ashiy\u0101n\u012b the mention of a departure to the world of holiness. Contrary to his laudable habit of regarding such references as unbecoming (makr\u016bh), as being repugnant to the management of affairs, and of avoiding them in conversation, he now took pleasure in speaking on the subject. Seemingly the flash had pictured itself in the antechamber of his mystery-knowing heart. Among such references there was this that one day he quoted with commendation the true words of His Majesty Geti-sit\u0101n\u012b Fird\u016bs-Mak\u0101n\u012b, when he remarked in a meeting of friends that a servant of his used to say that whenever he saw the graves in Ghaznin\u00b9 he felt an inclination to die. Following up this, His Majesty would say that when he contemplated\u00b2 Delhi and its shrines the words recurred to his memory, and he thought how sweet they were! At about the same time and when he was proceeding towards the eternal world he said to several of his familiars: \u201cThis day after paying my morning devotions a mysterious thing occurred and a secret inspiration brought this quatrain on my lips:\u201d\u2014\n\n\u00b9 \u201cHere (Ghaznin) is the last resting-place of Hakim San\u0101\u02be and many other saintly personages.\u201d A.F. in \u0100\u02bein, Jarrett, II, 408.\n\u00b2 Probably Humayun was referring to a visit which he paid to the shrines and graves in and round Delhi in company with Sidi \u2018Ali shortly before his death. See p. 53 of the Admiral\u2019s book.\nVerse.\n\n\"O God, make me wholly Thine.\nAcquaint me with Thine attributes.\nTyrannous Reason hath crippled my soul.\nCall me Thine own madman\\(^1\\) and set me free.\"\n\nTears fell from his truth-seeing eyes while he was reciting these lines, and complete detachment was manifested on his irradiated brows. About the time, too, when the Court was at Delhi, the eye-brightener of the khilafat, to wit, His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h, one night beheld in a dream that someone was pulling up his\\(^2\\) musky (i.e., black) locks. When he awoke he told the dream to M\u0101ham Anaga, the mother of Adham Kh\u0101n. She summoned all the skilled interpreters and asked them what the dream portended. When this question was put to His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b he said: \"Evil will be far from his (Akbar's) head.\" Afterwards he told them quietly of his own inevitable doom, and administered consolation to them. Constantly during those days he was uttering words which had for the organs of the farseeing among the courtiers the savour of a passage from this transitory world which all must quit, and which divided\\(^3\\) the joints and marrow of the faithful of soul. Among other things, he wrote with his own hand on the arch of his portico these opening lines of a poem by Shaikh \u0100z\u0101r\u012b:\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Erskine, Hist., 535, note. His translation and account of the circumstances differ somewhat from the text. Apparently the poet contrasts the cold light of reason with the ecstasy of madness (or love). The translation in Erskine's version of the Akbarn\u0101ma in the B.M. is nearer the original.\n\n\\(^2\\) The text has \u0101\u1e45k\u0101\u1e63rat, which presumably stands for Hum\u0101y\u016bn, but a footnote says that several MSS. have \u012bgh\u0101n, and all the MSS. that I have examined in the B.M., I.O., and R.A.S. have \u012bgh\u0101n, and so has the Lucknow edition. I have therefore adopted the variant. I think that what Akbar saw must have been the pulling of his own locks, otherwise there would have been no cause for alarm on his account, and it is hardly likely that his father, then a man of 50, would have black hair.\n\n\\(^3\\) I have paraphrased the passage. The literal translation is: \"The faithful of soul were cut to pieces.\"\n\n\\(^4\\) The poetical name of Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn Hamsa of Isfarain or Mihrj\u0101n near N\u012bsh\u0101p\u016br. He died in 866 A.H. Beale's Or. Dict., 90. See also Rieu., Cat. I, 43a. According to the account there \u0100z\u0101r\u012b, who took his poetical name from the month of his birth, was born at Marv and died in 866 A.H.\nVerse.\n\nI've heard that on this gilded dome (the sky) 't is writ\nThe end \\(^1\\) of all things is praiseworthy.\n\nHe also when near his departure reduced his consumption of opium, so much so that he said to his intimates \"We'll see for how many more days two or three pellets (habb) will suffice.\" He had seven days' divided supply and wrapped in paper, and made over to his body-servants, and he said to them \"this is all the opium we shall eat.\" On the day which was the first stage of his journey to the region of holiness and detachment, there remained four pellets. He sent for these, and partook \\(^2\\) thereof in rosewater.\n\nAt the close \\(^3\\) of Friday Rabi'-al-awwal 968, Sh\u0101h\n\n---\n\n1461-62. Bada\u016bn\u012b, III, 193, says that Maul\u0101n\u0101 Bek\u0101s\u012b is the authority for this story. He quotes the couplet.\n\n\\(^1\\) Another rendering might be: \"To meditate on the end of all things is praiseworthy.\" Price translates: \"Of all mankind the end is happy.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) The meaning is not quite clear. Probably A.F. means that H\u016bm\u0101y\u0101n took one of the four pellets along with rosewater. It is hardly likely that he would take four all at once. The day when he sent for the opium is clearly, I think, the day of the accident, and not of the death, and the time would be in the course of the day and before the accident, which occurred at evening. Probably the number four is dwelt upon as indicating that H\u016bm\u0101y\u0101n had set aside the exact number of pellets that would last till his death. If Friday was the day of the accident and he took one pill on that day, and survived till Monday, as Sidi \u2018Al\u012b says, this would be the case. According to other authorities he died on the evening of Sunday, the 26th January, or 13 Rabi'-al-awwal. This is the date given in the B\u0101dh\u0101h\u0101nu\u1e63ma of \u2018Abdu-l-Ham\u012bd, Bib. Ind. ed., p. 63.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u1e24\u0101fir-i-r\u016bz. But perhaps the \u1e25\u0101safat is wrong, and the translation should be: \"At length, on Friday,\" &c. A.F. does not give the day of the month; but, as he says later on, that the officers concealed the accident (or at least its seriousness) for seventeen days and then proclaimed Akbar on 28 Rabi'-al-awwal, we may take it that the fall occurred on Friday, the 11th Rabi'-al-awwal, corresponding to 24th January, 1556. See Mrs. Beveridge's translation of Count Noer's Akbar, I. 67, note. The date, 11 Rabi'-al-awwal, given at the end of Stewart's translation of Jauhar is not in the original, and the whole sentence is an addition. There is a good deal of discrepancy about the dates of Hum\u0101y\u0101n's fall and death, and on these points reference may be made to the note above quoted and also to Mr. C. J. Rodgers' note in the J.A.S.B. for 1871, Vol. XL, p. 133, and to Mr.\nBlochmann's remarks thereon. A.F.'s statement that the fall occurred on a Friday is supported by the circumstance that a number of worshippers were assembled at the adjoining mosque, as would naturally be the case on a Friday, and also by the testimony of K\u0101tib\u012b-R\u0101m\u012b, the Turkish admiral, S\u012bd\u012b \u2018Al\u012b R\u014dz\u012b. He was in Delhi at the time; and, though he does not expressly say so, he was apparently present at the last audience. His words (Vamb\u00e9ry's translation, Luzac, 1899, p. 55) are: \"All was ready for the start (the Admiral's). Hum\u00e2y\u016bn had given audience on Friday evening, when, upon leaving his castle of pleasure, the Muzezzin, announced the Esan just as he was descending the staircase. It was his wont, whenever he heard the summons, to bow the knee in holy reverence. He did so now, but unfortunately fell down several steps, and received great injuries to his head and arm.\" Truly the proverb rightly says, 'There is no guarding against fate.'\n\n\"Everything was confusion in the palace, but for two days they kept the matter secret. It was announced to the outer world that the sovereign was in good health, and alms were distributed amongst the poor. On the third day, however, that was on the Monday, he died of his wounds.\"\n\nIt seems to me probable that the Turkish Admiral is the person referred to by A.F. as Caghat\u0101\u012b Kh\u0101n. No officer of Hum\u00e2y\u016bn's or Akbar's of that name is mentioned anywhere, and S\u012bd\u012b \u2018Al\u012b may have got the sobriquet of Caghat\u0101\u012b Kh\u0101n on account of his proficiency in the Caghat\u0101\u012b language. See the Turkish publisher's preface, Vamb\u00e9ry, i.e., p. XVII. S\u012bd\u012b \u2018Al\u012b, too, had just come from Gujr\u0101t. Another reason for believing Friday to be the day, is that Friday was Hum\u00e2y\u016bn's day for holding receptions and granting audiences. See A.N.Cap., LXII. On the whole then, unless it can be established astronomically that Venus did not rise on Friday, 24th January 1556, I think we may take that to be the day of the accident. This date is further corroborated by S\u012bd\u012b \u2018Al\u012b's statement that he left for Lahore on a Thursday in the middle of Rabi'-al-awwal. He did not leave till after the death, and Thursday would be the 17th Rabi'-al-awwal. Vamb\u00e9ry's translation, contrary to that of Diez, makes Thursday the day of the Admiral's arrival at Lahore, but this is clearly wrong.\n\nWith regard to the place and circumstances of the accident there is\n\n---\n\n1 Blochmann, 371 and 382.\n2 If this was Kh\u0101n \u2018\u0100lam Calma Beg, Blochmann, 378, he must have returned from Mecca before K\u0101mr\u0101n's death. But perhaps it is not. \u2018\u0100lam Sh\u0101h is mentioned at p. 325 of text as one of those who accompanied K\u0101mr\u0101n to India.\n3 It would seem from this as if Beg M\u016blak had repented and gone after K\u0101mr\u0101n.\nfrom the Hij\u00e1z, and Caghat\u00e1i Kh\u00e1n and some men from Gujrat came and made reports. Also Pahlw\u00e1n D\u00f6st M\u00edr Barr, and Maul\u00e1n\u00e1 Asad came from K\u00e1b\u00fal with representations from Mun\u2018im Kh\u00e1n. At the end of the day he came out on the roof of the library which had recently been fitted up, and gave the people who were assembled at the chief mosque the blessing of performing homage (korni\u011f). For a considerable time he asked questions about Holy Mecca and about Gujrat and K\u00e1b\u00fal.\n\nAfter that he sent for all the mathematicians, for it was expected that Venus would rise on that night and he wished to observe her.\n\na good account by Mr. Rodgers in the paper already referred to. He corrects the mistakes of Elphinstone and Marshman. I visited the place in September, 1899. The building is known as the Sher Mandal from having been built by Sher Shah and is described by Syed Ahmad in his A\u1e63r \u0160an\u0101d\u012bd (see also Gar\u00e7in de Tassy's translation). It is an octagonal building of red stone and has two storeys. But the first is now solid, i.e., has no room in it. It has inside stairs leading up to the second storey, which is an octagonal room fitted with niches (t\u0101q), which perhaps were used as bookshelves. From this two separate flights of steps lead up to the roof, on which there is a small open cupola supported on eight pillars. One of the flights is shown by the guides as that from which Hum\u00e2y\u00fcn fell. There is a turn in the stairs and the steps are of granite, a foot high, and steep and narrow. The stairs open out, it should be stated, in the body of the roof, so that Hum\u00e2y\u00fcn fell through the roof rather than off it. He certainly did not fall over the parapet. \"The stairs come up on both sides of the cupola, in the space interven-\n\ning between it and the parapet.\" (Rodgers). Presumably Hum\u00e2y\u00fcn's intention was to sit down on the part of the roof which formed the first step of the stair, and to rest his feet on the second step (Zina-i-duwam). It was the cold weather and so he would naturally be wearing a long dressing-gown. The guides say that the body was wrapped in cotton. As we know from the Maasir Rahimi it was brought away from Delhi when Him\u00fcn defeated Tardi Beg and got possession of the city. It was kept for a time at Sirhind and then brought back and kept near the Pur\u0101na Qila till the grand tomb, built by Hum\u00e2y\u00fcn's widow, Haji Begam, was ready.\n\nThe Sher Mandal is to the south of Delhi and about four miles from the railway station. It is near the Jama and was still nearer it in old times. Hard by, is the Jama Masjid of Sher Sh\u00e2h, and Hum\u00e2y\u00fcn's tomb is not far off. The reason probably why Hum\u00e2y\u00fcn was then residing at the Sher Mandal was because that neighbourhood is the site of the city of Dinpanah, which was founded by Hum\u00e2y\u00fcn in earlier and happier days.\nIt was his excellent intention that when Venus rose and the moment became auspicious he would hold a grand assembly and make promotions of officers. At the beginning of the evening he wished to descend and when he came to the second step, a reciter (muqri), by name Miskin (wretched), raised an untimely call to prayer. His Majesty, out of respect to the call, wished to sit down where he was.\n\nAs the steps (darj\u0101t) of the stair (z\u012bn\u0101) were sharp (tez) and the stones slippery (laghzanda) his blessed foot caught in the skirt of his robe at the moment of sitting down and his good staff slipped. He lost his feet and fell upon his head, his right temple receiving a severe blow, so that some drops of blood issued from his right ear. As he possessed a heart acquainted with mysteries he immediately, and in order that he might give comfort and also make dispositions for the world, sent an affectionate dispatch containing a report of his welfare to the nursling of the light of fortune by the hands of Nazr Shaikh Culi.\n\nOne of the wondrous flashes of his (Akbar's) intelligence was that in the middle of that very day (the day of the accident, not of the announcement) he had said to some of his suite that a great misfortune would happen to an eminent man and that probably he would die.\n\nThe loyalists who were on the spot endeavoured to conceal the\n\n---\n\n1 Z\u012bna-i-dusum. The exact meaning of the expression is doubtful. Naturally one would think that it referred to the second step of the top stair, but z\u012bna means a stair rather than a step, and the word darj\u0101t as used just below to mean the steps. Perhaps A.F. means the second flight of steps counting from below, or he may have supposed that the fall was from the lower or second flight of steps. The stairs are certainly very steep and awkward and might easily cause a nasty fall.\n\n2 \"The recital of the \u0101g\u0101n must be listened to with great reverence. If a person be walking at the time he should stand still; if reclining sit up.\" Hughes' Dict. of Islam, 286.\n\n3 Bay\u0101zid enters him on his list as Shaikh Nazr Culi Turkist\u0101n\u012b and says that after the conquest of India Akbar made him M\u012br '\u0100dl. Presumably Nazr was his name, and Culi his title, from having been with Hum\u0101y\u016bn in the desert. The M\u012br\u0101t-i-'\u0100lam, B.M. Add., 7657, p. 971a, gives a copy of the letter which Nazr Shaikh conveyed. See translation of it in Blochmann's remarks on Rodgers' paper loc.\n\n4 M\u012byarm\u0101nd. This is the formula used by A.F. when mentioning Akbar's utterances.\ndreadful occurrence and took measures to send information to the heir-apparent of the masnad of the khilafat and to collect the principal officers who had obtained leave to various parts of the kingdom. With extreme prudence they kept this life-destroying event from the public for seventeen days. Those who were present at court and the counsellors of the threshold of the khilafat, viz., Khizr Khwaja Khan, Ali Quli Khan, Latif Mirza, Khizar Khan Hazara, Qunduq Khan, Qamar Ali Beg, Ashraf Khan, Arzal Khan, who were in the list of helpful ministers (wusra'i kifayat pasha) and Khwaja Husain of Merv, Mir 'Abdu-l-Hai, Peshrav Khan, Mihtar Khan, and after some days Tardi Beg Khan, who inscribed on his heart's tablet the office of Amir-al-Umarah (Blochmann, 240) assembled together and on the 28th of the same month, 11th February, 1556, they recited the khutba in the famous name and lofty titles of the khedive of the age, and so healed and mended the distracted world and gave the terrene and terrestrial a message of enduring restoration. The stewards of heaven, who had been in expectation of this, rejoiced, 'and the desires of the administrators of the natural world were accomplished. Mir 'Abdu-l-Hai Sadr recited this couplet:\n\nVerse.\n\nIf the world's new year be destroyed,\nLet the hundred-leaved red rose remain.\n\nSeveral persons had recited this verse, and it had become well known and had been made the subject of conversation at assemblies. A strange thing was that at the same time one of the literate (fazla) had found the second line to give the date of the accession of the Khedive of the Age, but this was by writing the word gul with an i, gul\u00ee, though in one sense the ordinary orthography does not lend itself to this form. And during the days of concealing this fatal affair they on one occasion dressed up Mull\u00e2 Bekasi in the clothes\n\n---\n\n1 That is, no doubt, they endeavoured to conceal the gravity of the accident. This agrees with what Sidi 'Ali tells us.\n2 The second line yields 953 and if I be added it yields 10 more or 963. I think the meaning is that 'Abdu-l-Hai uttered the verse without any thought of its being a chronogram, and that the strange thing was that it was afterwards found that a slight alteration made it into a chronogram.\n3 Sidi 'Ali Reis, the Turkish ad-\nthe deceased (lit.: that pardoned pinnacle) and brought him out on\ntop of the terrace (aiwan) which was His Majesty's place of\nresting, and showed him to the people with his face towards the\nver. The people performed the kornig and were in some measure\nrelieved from their distress and confusion.\n\nWhen the sad misfortune was made known a great disturbance\nand trouble, such as was natural at a crisis like this, arose. The\nofficers exerted themselves to soothe hearts and give people confi-\ndence and did what was proper at this time of dispersion both in\nrespect of friends and of foes. They did what they could to\nmend the breach and to cement the crack. And how could the\nbond (\"aqd) of the eternal fortune of this noble family not attain\ncorroboration and shape when the world-adorning glory of the per-\nsonality of His Majesty the Sh\u00e2h\u00eensh\u00e2h, the true heir of sovereignty,\nhad seized the summit of the throne of the khilafat of the terrene\nand of terrestrials. Good God! How could it enter into the circle of\nthe thoughts and imaginings of the farseeing that a being so won-\ndrous in his perfections and so befriended of fortune, at once the\narranger of the visible world and the acquirer of spirituality, should\nso soon leave this earth? But as the time had come when the Creator\nwould give rejuvenescence to the old world and give a new education\nto mankind,\u2014a time which had not arrived in many cycles of the\npast,\u2014of necessity He designed to exhibit the nobly-constituted and\nconsummate paragon who should be the perfection of mortals. Con-\n\nmiral, l.c. 57, tells this story and\nconfirms A.F.'s account. He calls\nthe representative Mull\u00e2 B\u00ee and\nsays he bore a striking resemblance\nto Hum\u00e2y\u00e2n, though he was of\nslighter (\"shorter,\" in Diez) make.\nS\u00eed\u00ee 'Al\u00ee says the deception took\nplace on the Tuesday, and he gives\nhimself the credit of having suggested\nthe concealment. But Gulbadan\nBegam tells us that the same thing\nwas done when her father died.\nBad\u00e2'\u00een\u00ee, III, 192, has an account of\nB\u00eak\u00e2s\u00ee, i.e., I presume the orphan or\ndestitute one, but singularly enough\nhe says nothing about his impersona-\ntion of Hum\u00e2y\u00e2n. B\u00eak\u00e2s\u00ee seems to\nhave been a native of Ghazn\u00een and\nhe died at Peshawar in 973, 1566. He\nwas a poet, and Bad\u00e2'\u00een\u00ee gives speci-\nmens of his verses. It is interesting\nto find S\u00eed\u00ee 'Al\u00ee confirming A.F. in\nthe small matter of the impersona-\ntion's having taken place on the\nriverside.\n\nIn F. H. Diez's translation, in his\nDenkw\u00fcrdigkeiten von Asien, Ber-\nlin, 1815, p. 209, the name is given\nas Mull\u00e2 Bikjissi. His translation\nseems to be better than Vamb\u00e9ry's.\nsequently the occurrence of this unavoidable event, though in the eyes of the superficial a subject of mourning and sorrow, might be reckoned by the eyes of the mature of vision as a treasury of glory and beauty. For by the bounteous presence of this sublime pearl of sovereignty the visible and invisible worlds became again glorious, and the market-square of dominion, spiritual and temporal, became active. And as the lofty intelligence of this lord of the age was come to perfection, and the constituent elements of the rule of this great-thoughted one had been put in order and the die of dominion had turned up inscribed with his name, seeing that with real ancestorhood he wore the vesture of sonship, if the ruler of the age (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) had on account of his right-seeing and good qualities been preserved in the prison of visible life, it must have followed that, on account of the submission to the noblest, which is proper according to the rules of wisdom, this eminent one of the age (Hum\u0101y\u016bn) should submit to the nursling of light (Akbar). But as the robe of fatherhood is an imposing one and cometh from God, it could not harmonise with obedience to the offspring. Also the happiness of children cannot be recorded in the book of fate except when they submit to their fathers and obey their behests. Consequently it was unavoidable that the beginning of the feast of fortune should be the lord of the earth's leaving this world.\n\nIn fine, after giving consolations and congratulations, the imperial servants who were collected in Delhi separated in order to unite distracted hearts, and each hastened to his own place. Tardi Beg Kh\u0101n, who in concert with them was at Delhi, in order to arrange the affairs of this city, sent the insignia of sovereignty along with Ghul\u0101m \u2018Al\u012b Sh\u0101hanga\u0161t and other trusty servants to the world-protecting court and made declarations of obedience and devotion. M. Ab\u016b-l-Q\u0101sim,\u00b9 the son of M. K\u0101mr\u0101n, was also sent to do homage.\n\n\u00b9 This apparently is the same person as the Ibr\u0101h\u012bm mentioned as having, when a child, wrestled with Akbar. He probably had his name changed when he became father of a son. I regret to say that Akbar afterwards had him put to death in Gw\u0101l\u012br.\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nOF THE DOMINION-INCREASING ACTS OF HIS MAJESTY THE SH\u0100HIN-SH\u0100H FROM THE TIME OF HIS FELICITOUS SETTING OUT FOR THE PANJ\u0100B TILL HIS SACRED ACCESSION.\n\nThe brief account of the fortune-encompassing condition of His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h from the time of his being dispatched to the Panj\u0101b till his glorious accession is that when the standards of fortune were turned towards the Panj\u0101b the Atka Kh\u0101n and other servants came from Hi\u1e63\u0101r Fir\u016bza and met him on the way, in accordance with an intimation to that effect, and had the honour of paying their respects. When fortune\u2019s equipage arrived at Sihind all the king\u2019s servants who had been appointed as auxiliaries to Sh\u0101h Ab\u016b-l-Ma\u02bf\u0101li, such as Mu\u1e25ammad Quli Kh\u0101n Bar\u012bs, Mu\u1e63\u1e25ib Beg, Khw\u0101ja Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn Mahmud, Far\u1e25at Kh\u0101n, T\u0101hir Mu\u1e25ammad, son of M\u012br Khurd, and Mihtar Taim\u016br Sharbatai, came away without leave (from Ab\u016b-l-Ma\u02bf\u0101li) on hearing of the advance of His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, and hastened to obtain the bliss of service, for they had been troubled by the evil fellowship of that ill-regulated young man. They were favourably received. Sikandar, who had come out of the hills, withdrew to them again before the victorious army had encamped. The infatuated M\u012br who had marched out to put him down hastened back to Lahore. When it became certain that the province had been given to His Majesty the Sh\u0101h\u012bnsh\u0101h, and that he was proceeding thither, Abu-l-Ma\u02bf\u0101li felt constrained to come with a body of troops to the bank of the Sult\u0101npur river (the Bi\u0101s) and to do homage. His Majesty out of kindness, and in order to ratify the favour that had been shown by His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b himself indicated to Ab\u016b-l-Ma\u02bf\u0101li that he should take a seat\n\n1 That is, Hum\u0101y\u016bn\u2019s servants. The Atka Kh\u0101n and others who came from Hi\u1e63\u0101r were Akbar\u2019s special retainers.\nThe Majesty went on towards the h\u016bs in order to extirpate Karamat who was stated to be in M\u0101kot and its neighbourhood.\n\nWhen the army of fortune encamped near Har\u012bma a swift courier arrived and apprised Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n of His Majesty Jah\u0101nb\u0101n\u012b\u2019s fall. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n did not think it expedient to advance farther, and moved the army to Kal\u0101n\u016br in order that they might halt for some days in that pleasant place. Near Kal\u0101n\u016br Nazr Sh\u0101kh C\u016bl\u012b arrived and produced the sublime mandate (firm\u0101n). Just about this time the tidings of the inevitable events reached the royal hearing, and His Majesty displayed the weeping and lamentation which befitted the condition of affection and love. The distress and internal affliction which were experienced by that lofty-souled one exceeded human conception. Bair\u0101m Kh\u0101n, Atka Kh\u0101n and M\u0101ham Anaga essayed to comfort him, but as his sorrow sprung from excessive love what they regarded as topics of consolation only augmented his grief.\n\n---\n\n1 Humay\u016bn used to call him son.\n2 This was Akbar\u2019s appanage, which makes the favour shown to Abu\u2019l Ma\u2019\u0101lih the more striking.\n3 The Muqta\u1e63\u0101d R.M., Add.\n\n7657, p. 271a, gives what purports to be the substance of the letter. There is a translation of the passage in J.A.S.B., Vol. XL. for 1871.\nchosen one of God expends such sorrow of heart and consideration of individual men! How grieved and afflicted he is at the death of any one who has a savour of sincerity, devotion, and ability! It was fitting that such a disposition should show itself in his holy personality under circumstances which were in old times motives for rejoicing among the unthinking so that men of the world who regard only what they perceive by their senses may acknowledge the true grandeur of this great one, and that such acknowledgment may be a means of guiding all mankind, and that the guidance may result in general enlightenment and charity. If it were not for this reason, how could the wide domain of the knowledge, piety and devotion of this nursling of the light of glory permit that such censure of the decrees of Providence should contract the law of submission? At length by the assistance of far-reaching reason he conveyed himself to the asylum of patience and employed himself in alms-giving and in other good works which may benefit those who have travelled to the abiding world. Poets and sages composed elegies and chronograms. Among them was Khw\u0101ja \u1e24usain of Merv who made a tarkibband in an elegy, about that cupola of pardon, some lines of which are as follows:\n\nVerse.\n\nO heart, thou too must hear the sound of death.\nDeath's morning must blow on thy life's ascension,\nAs the order for tasting death is for all men.\nBe sure that the sherbet of death must be drunk.\nThis name of life which they imposed upon you.\nIs a name that must be carried on to the side of death.\n\n1 A note to the Lucknow edition says that a tarkibband is a composition in which the metre changes after seven or more verses. According to Dr. Ranking's book or Prosody, Bombay, 1895, p. 12, this is the definition of Turiband. Khw\u0101jah \u1e24usain made a famous poem about the birth of Jab\u0101ng\u012br. He is said to have died at K\u0101bul in 979. It is singular that the verses do not occur in most MSS. The editors of the Bib. Ind. edition say in a note that they are only to be found in the Lucknow edition. They do not occur in any of seven MSS. in the B.M. which I have examined. Unfortunately the editor of the Lucknow lithograph (1284 A.H.) does not tell us the sources of his text beyond vaguely stating at p. 8 of his preface that he was supplied by his publisher with several good copies of the book.\nBe not proud of this rose and garden of life.\nAutumn's breeze must blow on this rose and garden.\nThou hast heard with thine own ears that such an one remaineth not\nOthers's ears must receive tidings of thee likewise.\n\nMir 'Abdu-l-Hai found this chronogram:\n\nVerse.\nAlas, Alas! My king fell from the roof. (963).\nMaul\u0101n\u0101 Ma\u1e63'aud of \u1e24\u012b\u1e63\u0101r composed this:\n\nVerse.\nH\u016bm\u0101y\u016bn P\u0101dsh\u0101h was united to God. (963).\nBut this was by writing the sacred name (H\u016bm\u0101y\u016bn) without alif. Maul\u0101n\u0101 Q\u0101sim K\u0101hi made this chronogram:\n\nVerse.\nH\u016bm\u0101y\u016bn P\u0101dsh\u0101h fell from the roof. (962).\nThis chronogram is one year short. A difference of one or two years may be allowed in the case (of the dates) of buildings, but not in obituary chronograms.\u00b9 A number discovered this chronogram:\n\nVerse.\nLet Jal\u0101lu-d-din be the kingdom's heir. (963).\n\nThe spiritual and physical perfections and the notes of reason\n\n\u00b9 A.F. means that as buildings are often begun in one year and finished in another, an error of a year or two in the chronogram is not of importance. For an account of Q\u0101sim K\u0101hi, see Blochmann, 209, and 566, and Tabaq\u0101t Akbari, Lucknow ed., 396.\n\n\u00b2 Dr. Eth\u00e9 gives in his catalogue of the Persian MSS. in the India Office, No. 1441, p. 798, a chronogram by Hijr\u012b which deserves to be recorded. It is:\n\n\u062d\u06cc\u0641 \u0632\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0627\u062f\u0634 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0627\u06cc \u062d\u06a9\u06cc\u0645\nAlas! for the king, the saint, the sage (963).\n\nWith reference to A.F.'s statement that Q\u0101sim K\u0101hi's chronogram is defective by a year, it may be remarked that many seem to have thought that 963 was the year of the death. Bay\u0101sid, 81a, gives this date and so does Jauhar B.M. MS., 16, 711, p. 145a. It is also the date given in the verses engraved under the cornice at Sikandar. The stanza is:\n\n\u0632\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0647 \u062a\u0632\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0634\u0645\u062a \u062f\u0648\u0633\u0627\u0644\n\u06a9\u0647 \u0634\u0644\u0648 \u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631 \u0622\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u067e\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0647\u06cc\u0627\u0644\n\u0628\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0632\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u062f \u0646\u0634\u062a\n\u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u062a\u062e\u062a \u0627\u0648 \u06a9\u063a\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0632\u0627\u0642 \u0628\u0634\u062a\nand knowledge in this unique one of the world were greater than can be recorded. He was thoroughly versant in various sciences, rational and traditional ('aqli u naqli). Especially was he distinguished in the mathematical sciences. He always consorted with philosophers. Illustrious mathematicians obtained bliss at the foot of his throne. He desired to establish observatories and had collected the equipments thereof. He had fixed upon several sites for observatories. He also regarded with favour poetry and poets. And as he had a metrical turn he spent the intervals of time, between spiritual and temporal obligations, in composing poetry. The divan of his poems is in the grand library. The following quatrains are taken from that frontispiece of marvels:\n\n**Quatrain.**\n\nOh! heart, fret not in presence of the rival,\nTell not thy heart's condition to any physician.\nWhat has happened to thee from that tyrant\nIs a woeful tale, and a very strange event.\n\n**Another.**\n\nOh! heart, rejoice in the presence of the friend,\nIn his service faithfully consume thyself.\nEach night sit rejoicing in the thought of the friend,\nEach day make a New Year by meeting him.\n\n**Another.**\n\nOh thou, whose tyranny is a world's flag,\nThe day when I see not oppression from thee is oppressive.\nThe sorrow that comes from the tyrannous sphere,\nWhat sorrow is it to me when there is the sorrow of love for thee?\n\nthough possibly this may be explained as only meaning that 962 years were completed.\n\nIn the T\u0101r\u012bkh Alfi, I.O. M.S. No. 3293, p. 430b, 963 is given as the date, and no doubt this is correct, but perhaps many people were misled by Akbar's introduction of the Fa\u017el\u012b year and counted 963 as beginning with the vernal equinox of the year of his accession. It, therefore, seems unnecessary to have recourse to the emendation of the chronogram suggested by Mr. Rodgers, in his valuable paper on Eastern Chronograms, R.A.S.J., for 1898 p. 718.\nGod be praised! the exposition of this noble catena which, like the catena of the skies, is upheld by God and hath a holy refuge, and of which one extremity is bound to Adam \u1e62afi, the morning of Creation, while the other is linked with the ascension of the sun of the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h\u2019s personality, has been set forth with concision and brevity and in a fresh style other than that coming from the tainted pen of the deckers (ba\u1e63maci\u0101n) of epistolary models. By drawing up this grand catalogue and glorious preamble, Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl\u2014that airy particle\u2014has obtained benediction, and many mysteries and points of wisdom have found insertion as ancillaries. Were these truths, and mysteries separated from the main chronicle, they would form a choice book brimful of the marrow of wisdom.\n\nVerse.\n\nI made a cup of wine out of my blood.\nNot a jar of vinegar that blisters the breast.\nThere are many truths in each dot of it,\nWho does not perpend them, comprehends them not.\n\nThough in so far as regards ordinary readers what I have recounted up till now of the events of the ancestors may seem superfluous and a flux of words, yet the great society of truth-knowers is well aware that into this book of Divine praise\u2014may no evil eye approach it!\u2014I have not introduced, from the beginning to the end, a single superfluous letter. An account has been given of divers screens\u2014veils of the sacred Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h-beauty,\u2014and behind each screen there is the bridal face of genius. Away, away! Where is the screen, and where is the secluded bride? One beauty there is which assumes several manifestations, and within these is one genius which is full of radiance and which informs\u00b9 the world-illuminating Beauty.\n\nVerse.\n\nHe who knows speech knows\nWhat kind of speech this is.\n\nHow can I, whose heart is pawned in one place, turn towards the two worlds? What profit is there in the writing of histories? Two swords will not lie in one scabbard, or two purposes in one heart.\n\n\u00b9 I adopt the variant gir\u016b which I believe to be the Turkish \u062c\u06cc\u0631\u0647 gir\u016b.\nDo not take into consideration the distracted souls of the inconstant, for where is the heart of those heartless, earthly-natured ones that can be subjected to consideration? But for the sage inquirer into causes the truth is illustrated by the ascent of His Majesty the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h, and so the afflicted world of secondary causes has been brought into the noose of design. And by profound contemplation and good fortune, the stewards of fate, who, owing to the happy auspices of this individual, have brought the chapters of felicity to a conclusion, have revealed the world-adorning beauty of the Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101h in the exponents of this sublime catena, so that the genuine love for that unique one of the divine temple has given zeal for the writing of this lengthy chronicle. The convention of discourse has been made animated, and the rose garden of ornaments been watered. Neither has there been any flagging in the single-heartedness of this desert-traverser. The progressive beauties of the true beloved have been set forth, and the degrees of love's sciences have received their full ascension.\n\nNow what the vulgar and the superficial have regarded as a digression has been concluded and the time has come for what both sections (of readers) regard as the true object. I hope I may obtain my wish in the noble enterprise.\n\nVerse.\n\nMy pen whose point is a mysterious tongue,\nIs the treasure-opener of a secret mine,\nFrom him who regards it with gravity\nI ask justice, not acclamation.\n\nVerse.\n\nMay this work be worthy applause!\nMay God grant that so it may be.\n\nEnd of Volume I.\nINDEX\n\nTO THE\n\nFIRST VOLUME.\n\nThe numbers refer to the pages; n stands for \"footnote.\"\n\nA.\n\n\u0100b-ist\u0101da, 461 and n 2.\nAb\u0101 bikr M. s.
