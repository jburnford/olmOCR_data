It is bounded on the north by the unexplored region south of Chinese Turkistan, and the Chinese territory of Khoten; on the east, by the Chinese territory of Khoten, and Chan-than and Rodokh, districts of Great Tibet; on the south, by Koonawur, Kulu, Lahoul, Kishthewar, Chumba, and Kashmir; and on the west, by Kashmir and Bultistan. Moorcroft reports as to its extent as follows:\u2014\u201cThe precise extent of Ladakh can scarcely be stated without an actual survey, but our different excursions, and the information we collected, enabled us to form an estimate, which is probably not far wide of the truth. From north to south, or from the foot of the Karakoram mountains to the fort of Trankar, in Piti, the distance is rather more than two hundred miles; and from east to west, or from La Ganskiel Pass to that of Zoje La, it cannot be less than two hundred and fifty. The outline, however, is irregular, being contracted on the north-west and south-west, and the whole area may not much exceed thirty thousand square miles.\u201d The information obtained by Vigne justifies us in placing the northern boundary a little farther north, and stating the position of Ladakh as being between lat. $32^\\circ$\u2014$35^\\circ$, long. $75^\\circ 30'$\u2014$79^\\circ 30'$. The most important feature in the physical aspect of Ladakh is the great valley of the Indus, which traverses the country through its whole length from south-east to north-west, and divides the great northern range, called variously Kouenlun, Mooz Taugh, or Karakorum, from the stupendous mountains of Rupshu, Spiti, and Zanskar.\nInto this main valley others of less dimensions open, being drained by the rivers which discharge themselves into the Indus. Of these, the principal are the Shy Yok on the north, the Zanskar on the south. There is a general though very irregular slope of the country from the south-east, lying about the upper course of the Indus, to the north-west, where that great river crosses the frontier into Bultistan. The whole of Ladakh is included within the drainage system of the Indus, with the exception of Spiti, which is drained by the river of the same name, a tributary of the Sutlej; and the small basins drained into the respective lakes of Chamorreril and Pangking. The most elevated mountains are in the east and south-east, where some rise to heights probably superior to those of any summits on the face of the globe. Lloyd, describing the mountains of Spiti, on the left bank of the Indus, observes:\u2014\u201cThe summits of this highest range have been estimated, upon good grounds, by the Gerards, who alone have explored many portions of these wild recesses, to rise to the enormous elevation of 30,000 feet.\u201d To the east, at no great distance from the frontier of Ladakh, rises the celebrated Kangree, or Kylas, also having the estimated height of 30,000 feet. In the south of Zanskar are the vast peaks Mer and Ser, considered by H\u00fcgel the highest summits from the Sutlej to the Indus. The mountains of Karakorum or Mooz Taugh, on the north side of the valley of the Indus, are believed by the natives to be of much less height than those just mentioned. Vigne, who has done much more than any other European towards exploring them, learned from native report that, at the pass into Yarkund, they are without snow for the greater part of the year, and he concludes their height to be somewhat under 15,000 feet. A little farther west, however, this enterprising traveller ascended to the height of 16,000 feet. Moorcroft states the confluence of the Zanskar river and the Indus, near the western frontier, to be nearly 12,000 feet above the sea, and we may safely conclude that the elevation of no part of Ladakh is less than 10,000, that of few parts less than 15,000, and that a few summits approach the enormous height of 30,000 feet. At the eastern extremity, is the very elevated and dreary plain or table-land through which the upper part of the Indus holds its course, and which, terminated to the east by the colossal Kylas, stretches to the north-east into\nthe unexplored regions of Chinese Tartary. These plains consist generally of sand or gravel, the disintegrated relics of the granite, quartz, slate, sandstone, and limestone of the mountains. Occasionally low round hills may be observed, all as bleak and barren as the plain, and apparently incapable of sustaining animal life. \"Yet such, and even loftier situations,\" observes Gerard, \"are the pasturing regions of innumerable flocks, where it is difficult for the eye to detect any nutritious vestige.\" In such tracts only do the shawl-goats attain perfection. \"The deserts of Tibet are their natural soil, where they feed upon a prickly stubble or heathy-like grass scarce visible to the eye. Yet myriads of these beautiful animals chequer the almost barren slopes of the mountains to which they seem destined.\"\n\nThe great mountain ranges of Ladakh in general are of primary formation\u2014granite, quartz, slate, and gneiss. In one place, Vigne mentions the occurrence of trap. The geology of the south-eastern part presents the singular phenomena of enormously lofty mountains of recent formations, such as stratified and conglomerate limestone, siliceo-calcareous rock, consisting in a great measure of shells, fossilized bones, and other animal exuviae. In some places mountains, consisting almost entirely of fossilized animal exuviae, have a height of 17,000 feet, and overtop the ranges of primary formation. From his own observation and the reports of the natives, Gerard concludes that \"the mountain ridges and the plains of the interior, from the skirt of Ladakh, and even the limit of Turkestan, to the table-land of the Brahmaputra at Teshu Lumpu, abound with fossil relics, the living prototypes of which have disappeared from the earth.\" Notwithstanding that a large portion of the mountains of Ladakh are composed of formations usually metalliferous, the mineral deposits, as far as hitherto explored, are singularly poor. Gold has been found in the sands of the river Shy Yok, but its collection is discouraged by the authorities, apparently from combined motives of policy and superstition. Some lama predicted that unless the pursuit were discontinued, the grain harvest would fail, and there is also a belief that gold lying in the soil belongs to local deities, who would inevitably inflict dreadful misfortunes on such as should sacrilegiously seize it. Lead, copper, and iron ores have been discovered, but these are too bulky and heavy for transport through so difficult a country, and as\nfuel is excessively scarce, they will, probably, continue for ever valueless, unless coal should be brought to light in quantities sufficient for their extensive reduction. Sulphur may be obtained in many places, and soda is abundant. Borax, which is here an article of commerce, does not appear to be a native product, but to be procured by means of barter, from Chinese Tartary or Great Tibet.\n\nThe climate is characterized by cold and excessive aridity. The snow-line, or lowest limit at which snow is perpetual, is so unusually high in Spiti and Rupshu, at the south-eastern extremity of Ladakh, as to shew the utter futility of attempting to theorize respecting the so-called isothermal lines, in the present scanty and imperfect state of our information as to the data from which they should be determined. Gerard observes respecting Spiti, in lat. 32\u00b0,\u2014\u201cThe marginal limit of the snow, which upon the sides of Chimborazo occurs at fifteen thousand seven hundred feet, is scarcely permanent in Thibet at nineteen thousand, and upon the southward aspect has no well-defined boundary at twenty-one thousand feet;\u201d and one summit, twenty-two thousand feet high, was seen by him to be free of snow on the last day in August. This absence of snow probably results in part from the very small quantity of moisture kept suspended in the highly rarefied atmosphere, in part from the intense heat of the direct rays of the sun, the latter cause being in some degree dependant on the former. \u201cWherever we go,\u201d observes Gerard, \u201cwe find the sun\u2019s rays oppressive.\u201d In one instance, in the beginning of September, at an elevation of fifteen thousand five hundred feet, a thermometer, resting upon the rocks, marked $158^\\circ$; in another, at fourteen thousand five hundred feet, the instrument, placed on sand, marked $130^\\circ$; and in a small tent, at an elevation of thirteen thousand, it indicated $110^\\circ$. These phenomena Gerrard attributes to the rarefaction and tenuity of the atmosphere, from elevation, and the absence of moisture,\u2014circumstances which allow of such immediate radiation of heat, that at the same moment there will be a difference of more than a hundred degrees between places only a few hundred yards asunder, occasioned by the one receiving and the other being excluded from the direct rays of the sun. He justly adds, \u201cThese facts, and their effects upon the constitution of men, animals, and vegetation, are not properly understood in Europe, or, if known, are explained upon theoretical assumptions...\nwhich have no grounds of existence in nature.\" At Rupshu, at the elevation of sixteen thousand feet, it freezes every night even at midsummer; but the heat of the day so far countervails the cold of night, that the lake Chamoreril, fifty miles in circumference, is free from ice during the summer months. At Le, considerably lower, having an elevation of about ten thousand feet, frost, with snow and sleet, commences early in September and continues until May, and the thermometer, from the middle of December to February, ranges from $10^\\circ$ to $20^\\circ$, even in June, the rivulets are often, at night, coated with ice. Notwithstanding this general low temperature, as the heat of the sun's rays, during the day, in the summer months, is very great, and scarcely ever intercepted by a cloud, Tartarian oats, and other crops requiring a high temperature but during only a short period, succeed here, though they have been found to fail when tried on the mountains of Europe having a much higher mean temperature. Moorcroft found the thermometer, when exposed to the sun's rays at midday in July, to range from $134^\\circ$ to $144^\\circ$.\n\nThe atmosphere is in general dry in all parts of the country, nearly all the moisture which the soil receives being from snow. Moorcroft, who lived in the country above a year, says\u2014\n\n\"During our stay, rain fell but on ten days, and then in very small quantities, between the end of April and the middle of September, and this, we were informed, much exceeded the average fall.\"\n\nIn the very elevated tracts the parching effects of the attenuated and dry air are represented as greater than in the most sultry wastes of the torrid zone. Gerard states, \"The dryness was quite withering; every thing flexible is converted into a coriaceous hardness.\" Butchers' meat is dried up and preserved from putrefaction at a temperature of $66^\\circ$ or $68^\\circ$. Things do not rot, they merely fall into dust in a long course of ages; the argillaceous roofs of the houses are actually baked by the sun's rays till they become like tile; timber is nearly indestructible, insomuch that in ruined buildings it remains unchanged for centuries, while the walls crumble away. The vegetation, consisting of a short spiky grass, or of furze and other thorns, a few inches high, is never green, having at all seasons a brown and scorched appearance. This is the only food of the indigenous sheep, remarkable for size, the quality of the flesh and wool, and for strength, activity, and endurance,\nin consequence of which they are the principal and almost the only beasts of burthen in many parts of Tibet.\\(^9\\) From the influence of food and climate, the goat, the yak, the deer, the dog, and even the horse, acquire, under the ordinary hair, a wonderfully fine and downy wool, which they lose when removed to more luxuriant pastures, and climates of greater moisture and warmth.\\(^1\\) Men appear to be alone proof against this influence, \"being denied all beard, while their black bushy heads seem to be insensible to thermal changes.\"\\(^2\\) This is the more remarkable, as the lamas never wear any head-dress.\n\nThe rivers of Ladakh are the Indus, or Sin-Kha-bab, and its feeders, the Shy Yok on the right side, on the left the Zanskar river, and lower down the river of Dras. This last receives a considerable feeder called the Pushkyum.\\(^3\\) The Spiti river, as already mentioned, discharges itself into the Sutlej. There are two small isolated systems of drainage, one in the south-east, into Lake Chamoreril,\\(^4\\) the other in the north-east, into Lake Pangkung. Both these are considerable pieces of water: the former about fifty miles in circuit, and brackish, the latter about twice that size, and extremely salt.\\(^5\\) Thog-ji Chenmo is a small lake a few miles north-west of Chamoreril.\\(^6\\) These lakes and streams are mentioned under their names in the alphabetical arrangement. The rivers receive numerous torrents, generally during summer subject to regular diurnal increase, from the heat of the sun in the daytime thawing the snow on the neighbouring mountains. From this cause, a stream, quite inconsiderable in the morning, becomes often towards evening rapid, deep, and powerful.\n\nThe scantiness of vegetation necessarily restricts the range of animal life. The carnivorous quadrupeds are bears, leopards, lynxes, ounces, wolves, foxes, and various musteline quadrupeds.\\(^7\\) The natives informed Moorcroft\\(^8\\) that the mountains are infested with a sort of tiger. This is probably the panther not uncommon in Kashmir. According to Vigne, there are yaks in a state of nature in the more secluded wilds, where also roams the kiang, an equine quadruped, respecting the zoological character of which Moorcroft\\(^9\\) leaves us more in the dark than might be expected from his professional pursuits. He says \"it is perhaps more of an ass than a horse, but its ears are shorter, and it is certainly not the gurkhor, or wild ass of Sindh.\" These\n\n---\n\n\\(^9\\) Gerard, ut supra, 247.\n\n\\(^1\\) Id. 245-247.\n\n\\(^2\\) Id. 245.\n\n\\(^3\\) Moorer. i. 264.\n\n\\(^4\\) Id. ii. 51; As.

As. Soc.,\" in Journ. As. Soc. Beng. 1842, p. 286, an opinion is set forth that the kiang is essentially a mountain animal, and distinct from the wild ass so often met with in the waste plains of Asia. Abbott, whose party chased and killed a wild ass in Khaurism, gives a Heraut and Khiva, description of it very different from that of the kiang of Gerard and Moorcroft. i. 297. It was sluggish and slow, and instead of escaping by its speed, stood at bay, and attacked the pursuers with its teeth and hoofs. He observes, \"the quarry just killed was a veritable donkey.\"} Though placed under physical circumstances so widely different, they seem to have much resemblance to the quagga which frequents the burning wastes of Southern Africa. There are also various quadrupeds vaguely described: wild goats, wild deer, ibexes, and wild sheep; and besides these, marmots, and a few murine quadrupeds. Birds are not numerous. Ravens are large, fierce, and powerful. The large chakor is a bird resembling a partridge, but of the size of a guinea-hen. There are sparrows, linnets, redbreasts, and larks. Waterfowl abound in the lakes. The rivers teem with fish, which the superstition of the natives does not allow them to molest. The domestic quadrupeds are horses, yaks, cows, asses, sheep, goats, and dogs. The zho is a hybrid between the male yak and the cow, and is very valuable both for draught and burthen. Though prolific, its progeny degenerates. The dogs of Ladakh resemble the Newfoundland breed, are of a dark colour, large, fierce, and sagacious. The Purik sheep is domesticated in every cottage, where it like a dog watches the meals of the family for fragments of food. It is very diminutive, not being larger than a common lamb of six months old, but has a bulky carcase in proportion to its height. The flesh is excellent, and the wool, which is clipped twice a year, is very fine. The ewe produces twice a year. Moorcroft\\footnote{Jour. Roy. As. Soc. 1824, p. 51, Moorer, on the Purik Sheep.} considers that it would be a valuable addition to the cottage economy of Britain, where three could be more easily maintained than one cur dog.\n\nLadakh has little timber; willows and poplars are planted about every village, but there do not appear to be any trees of wild growth. The sarsink, which appears to be identical with the sanjit of Kashmir, the eleagnus\\footnote{Royle, Bot. of Himalaya, 39.} of botanical classification, is\na tree, attaining a height of forty feet and a diameter of a foot, with leaves like those of the myrtle, minute flowers of exquisite fragrance, and fruit the size of an olive, of a cream colour, passing into yellow or orange from exposure to the sun, and containing a stone enveloped in a mealy pulp, palatable and wholesome. This pulp, when fermented, yields by distillation a spirituous liquor, generally preferred to brandy. There are ten varieties of apricot, some of very fine flavour, others unpalatable except when dried in the sun; in which state they continue unchanged for years, and are considered an acceptable article of diet. Apple-trees abound and bear large quantities of fine fruit. A prickly bush grows wild in a great many places, and bears a profusion of small acid berries. The rhubarb of medicine grows in vast profusion and of the finest quality. Dr. Royle mentions it in the following terms: \"Mr. Moorcroft sent some rhubarb, which for compactness of texture, colour, and properties, was as fine as any I have ever seen.\" Its botanical character has not been strictly determined, though mentioned by writers under the name of *Rheum Moorcroftianum*. Dr. Royle distinguishes it from both *R. Emodi* and *R. spiciforme*. However luxuriant the vegetation of the plant, the root is always found partially decayed, without the medicinal qualities of the sound part being from this cause in any respect impaired.\n\nThe western part of Ladakh produces an umbelliferous plant, called by the natives prangos (*Prangos pabularia*), and considered by Moorcroft superior for fodder to almost any other used for the purpose in any part of the world. The root is perennial, the leaves two feet long, and the stem five or six feet high. The whole of these are cut, dried, and used as fodder, which, though heating, is highly nutritious and strengthening. It grows on the barrenest and bleakest ground, and yields the enormous quantity of nine tons of fodder to the acre. The Longma, or sand-grass of Ladakh, rises from six to twelve inches above the ground, and forming an intricate network of stalks and fibres above and below the sandy surface, thus protects itself from being blown away by the violent winds which prevail. It has a long root, which strikes downward so deep, that its lower extremity cannot be reached by digging. The leaf is stiff and harsh, with sharp edges, and though not relished by cattle as long as other food is procurable, proves highly invigorating when they are compelled by necessity to resort to it. This appears to be the principal food of the\nyak, the shawl-goat, and other quadrupeds indigenous in the wilds of Tibet. Lucerne is extensively cultivated for fodder. The people of Ladakh are industrious and skilful agriculturists, forming the sloping surfaces into terraces, irrigated by means of water-channels conducted from the higher ground. The kinds of grain cultivated are wheat, barley, and buck-wheat, and Moorcroft mentions that some of the crops were superior to any that he had before beheld. Carraway, mustard, linseed, and tobacco are cultivated to a slight extent. The esculent vegetables are carrots, turnips, onions, cabbages, radishes.\n\nThe manufactures of Ladakh are few, rude, unimportant, and adapted for home consumption. The principal are woollen cloths, which are made thick, soft, and strong, and, from the cheapness of labour and of the material, are of very low price. Commerce is principally in transit, as Ladakh, from its situation, is the great thoroughfare for commercial intercourse between Chinese Tartary and Great Tibet on the one hand, and the Punjab on the other. The most important article of trade is shawl wool, a small portion of which is produced in the country, but much more imported from Chanthan, and forwarded to Kashmir. The other imports from Tibet, or from Chinese Tartary, are musk, borax, drugs, salt, tea, sugar, gold, silver, silks, velvets, camlets, furs, felts. Russian goods, such as broad-cloth, leather, hardware, and drugs, find their way through the same channel. The more valuable of these imports are destined to the Punjab. The imports from Kashmir and the Punjab are shawls, chintzes and other cottons, copper and tin utensils, shields, dye-stuffs, spices, drugs, pearls, butter, honey, and grain. It is obvious that very little of these can be intended for consumption in Ladakh, as there being no manufacturing industry, little but wool can be given in return. Moorcroft supposes the collection of gold, if allowed by the government, would form a very great source of national wealth. The beds of the rivers, he states, \"abound with gold, in oblong grains and laminae, detached from their matrix, and bruised, broken, and flattened in their journey down their stony channels.\"\n\nThe population is of that variety of the human race called the Mongolian by Blumenbach and his followers, and are classed under the general denomination Tibetan. The amount is estimated by Moorcroft at between 150,000 and 180,000 persons.\nThey have the usual features of the Mongolians, but improved by intermixture with the Kashmirian; the women especially, according to Gholaum Hyder,\\(^4\\) are pretty and fair, with rosy cheeks. In moral character they are mild, good-humoured, peaceable, and honest, but timid, indolent, excessively dirty, addicted to intoxication\\(^5\\) and sexual immorality.\\(^6\\) Gholaum Hyder\\(^6\\) observes:\u2014\u201cThey are the most peaceable race of beings in the world, very quiet, honest, and hospitable.\u201d In consequence of this disposition, crimes of violence are scarcely known. Polyandry is common among the lower orders, and, according to the last-quoted authority, under peculiarly disgusting circumstances. \u201cIn a family of two or more brothers who are poor, only one of them marries, and the wife is common to all, and no jealousies or quarrels ensue.\u201d\\(^7\\) Primogeniture here has such high privileges, that on the marriage of the eldest son, the property of the parents passes to him, and they become dependant on him for maintenance, while the younger brothers are little better than servants. The men wear close dresses of woollen cloth and large mantles, which, for the rich, are made of European broad-cloth; for the poor of sheepskin, with the wool inwards. The dress of the grand lama or priest is yellow; that of other lamas of superior rank red; and as these dignitaries wear broad-brimmed hats, they closely resemble cardinals in costume.\\(^8\\) The dress of the women consists of a jacket and petticoat of enormous dimensions, and a sheepskin mantle. When rich, they are loaded with a variety of fantastic ornaments and uncouth jewellery. \u201cA Ladakhi female, in full costume,\u201d observes Moorcroft, \u201cwould cause no small sensation amongst the fashionable dames of a European capital.\u201d\\(^9\\)\n\nThe diet of the Ladakhis in easy circumstances consists of the flesh of yaks, sheep, or goats, with vegetables, rice, and wheaten bread; that of the poorer classes, of barley, porridge, vegetables, and a very small quantity of bread. Tea is taken three times a day by such as can afford it. It is prepared by boiling the leaf with soda, then straining off the liquor, and mixing it well with butter and salt. They also drink chang, a weak fermented beverage, made from barley. They are fond of dancing, singing, horse-racing, and the polo or chaugan, a sort of game which may not inaptly be described as cricket played on horseback.\n\nThe language is Tibetan, according to Klaproth,\\(^1\\) the primi-\n\n---\n\n\\(^4\\) Ut supra, 170.\n\n\\(^5\\) Moorer, ii. 321.\n\n\\(^6\\) Gholaum Hyder, 178.\n\n\\(^7\\) Id. ib.; Moorer. i. 321.\n\n\\(^8\\) Vigne, ii. 356.\n\n\\(^9\\) Moorer. i. 328.\n\n\\(^1\\) Asia Polyglotta, 343.\ntive dialect of the aboriginal people inhabiting the vast mountain region between Hindostan and Tartary. It is very rough, and abounds in harsh combinations of consonants, unutterable even by those accustomed to the most rugged tongues of northern Europe. It has many roots in common with Chinese, and not a few with the language of the Samoeides, Ostiaks, and other tribes of Arctic Asia. Some consider that it has an affinity with the dialects of Turkestan and Kashmir.* Adelung knew little of this language, though he gives the names of perhaps a dozen who have treated of it. Whatever may be the value of Tibetan literature, it has been cultivated by native scholars to considerable extent and with much industry. Csoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si \u2020 mentions one compilation in one hundred and thirty-six printed volumes, consisting of treatises \"de omni scibili, et in quovis ente,\" theology, logic, grammar, rhetoric, prosody, astronomy, astrology, ethics, medicine, mechanics. The religion is Lamaism, a form of Buddhism, resembling apparently in its moral and spiritual tenets those entertained by the early ascetics and by the quietists of later date.\u2021 In the existence of monastic establishments for both sexes, the acknowledgment of a supreme infallible head of the whole religious community, and the adoption of pageantry in public worship, some seeming resemblance has been traced to the characteristics of the Romish church.\u00a7\n\nMoorcroft describes Lamaism as \"a strange mixture of meta-\n\n* \"The language of Tibet has much in common with the dialects of Turkestan and Cashmire. It abounds with nasals like the latter, whilst in articulation and accent it resembles Turkish.\" This position may be considered to have received the sanction of Professor Wilson, the translator and annotator of Izzez Ullah.\n\n\u2020 This Transylvanian left his country in search of knowledge, and without funds traversed Persia, Turkestan, and Afghanistan, and made his way to Calcutta. He subsequently explored Great Tibet, and gave the results of his researches into its literature and philology in a Tibetan grammar and dictionary, 2 vols. 4to., published in Calcutta. He, however, has abstained from tracing the affinity between this language and others. He also gave publicity in various other forms to a vast mass of information on Tibetan literature and religion. Csoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si died of fever at Darjeeling, in Nepal, in 1842, apparently a victim to his zeal for knowledge.\n\n\u2021 An extraordinary proof of this will be found in the summary of the spirit of Lamaism given by Csoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si.\n\n\u00a7 This view is supported by Wiseman, as quoted in Vigne, vol. ii. 251\u2014256.\nphysics, mysticism, morality, juggling, and idolatry.\u201d The transmigration of souls is received as a prominent tenet. The Deity is worshipped in the character of a trinity, but adoration is paid to a great number of inferior beings, represented by a variety of curious idols. The general character of Lamaism appears to be more gentle than that of many other superstitions, and under its influence the terrific Moguls and other Tartars have become a comparatively mild and peaceable race. In Tibet all set aside for the service of religion profess celibacy, whether they be lamas, who may be considered the secular clergy, gelums, or monks, or anis, or nuns. The number of these persons bears an enormous proportion to the bulk of the community, perhaps because, in such a climate, the demand for food and raiment countervails in a great many individuals the other animal desires. Moorcroft states that nearly two-thirds of the productive lands are appropriated to the support of the priesthood. Such a state of society may be supposed to operate as a powerful preventive check to the rapid increase of population in the narrow and barren territory of Ladakh.\n\nPreviously to the conquest of this country by the Sikhs, the government was a simple despotism, which, during Moorcroft\u2019s residence, was administered by the Khalum, or prime minister of the Rajah, who was himself but a mere pageant: at all times the sovereign was liable to be deposed by the intrigues of the influential lamas, and his place supplied by the next in hereditary succession. The revenue was not paid in money, the people being bound to support the Rajah and his officers, not only by furnishing provisions and all other things requisite for subsistence, but serving as domestic as well as agricultural labourers. They were likewise bound to take the field in case of collision with neighbouring states. Gholam Hyder says, the \u201ctroops are mostly horsemen, armed with a few matchlocks, bows and arrows, and swords, and may amount in all to 2,000 men; the infantry may be about 1,200 men, armed with matchlocks, bows and arrows, and swords.\u201d They are incredibly cowardly, and so ill armed that, according to Moorcroft, on occasion of a war with their neighbours of Bultistan, the infantry had but one matchlock for ten men and one sword for six. It is not therefore surprising that Ladakh made no resistance to the troops of Gulab.\nSingh, the Sikh chieftain of Jamu, who took possession of it in 1835, and retained his acquisition up to the time of the latest intelligence from that quarter.\n\nThe parganahs, or principal divisions, of Ladakh are\u2014Nobra in the north, Rupshu in the east, Spiti in the south-east, Zanskar in the south, Ladakh Proper, or Le, in the west and middle.\n\nLAH, in Sinde, a small town on the route from Mughribee to Mahomed Khan-ka-Tanda.

Lat. 23\u00b0 58', long. 68\u00b0 40'.\n\nLAHORE, in the Punjab, a large city, generally the residence of the ruler of the Sikhs, is situated on an offset or small stream flowing from the Ravvee, and about two miles east of the main stream. It is surrounded with a substantial brick wall twenty-five feet high, broad enough for a gun to traverse it, and strengthened by many circular towers and angular bastions at regular intervals. Runjeet Singh ran a good trench around the walls, and beyond this constructed a line of strong works and redoubts round the entire circumference, mounted them with heavy artillery, and cleared away such ruins and other objects as might yield shelter to assailants. The circuit of this line of fortifications exceeds seven miles. The fort or citadel occupies the north-west angle of the city, and contains extensive magazines and manufactories of warlike stores, as well as the residence of the Maharajah. There are several large and handsome mosques. The Padshah mosque, said to have been built by Aurungzebe,* is a massive, lofty structure of red sandstone, of great size, and ornamented with spacious cupolas. It was converted into a barrack by Runjeet Singh. The Vizier Khan mosque is also a fine edifice, ornamented with lofty minarets, and covered with varnished tiles inscribed with Arabic sentences, which are popularly supposed to comprise the entire of the Koran. These splendid structures have been desecrated by the Sikhs, who killed swine in them, and converted their courts into stables. The Sonara mosque is another splendid building. There are besides many handsome mosques and Hindoo temples, but they for the most part exhibit striking symptoms of the decay into which the city has fallen. One of the greatest ornaments of\n\n* It is attributed to Jehangir by H\u00fcgel (Kaschmir, iii. 211).\nLahore is the Shah dura, or tomb of the Mogul emperor Jehangir. It is very extensive and beautiful, of a quadrangular figure, with a minaret at each corner, rising to the height of seventy feet. The principal material is red sandstone, but there is a profusion of ornaments executed in marble, arranged in elegant mosaics, representing flowers, and texts of the Koran in Arabic and Persian. These texts consist of a hundred repetitions of the name of God in different modes of expression. There is a tradition that Aurungzebe demolished a dome that formerly covered this mausoleum, in order that the rain might fall on the tomb of his grandfather, in reprobation of his licentious conduct; but Moorcroft supposes that the building was never finished. This beautiful monument is about three miles west of Lahore. It is separated from the town by the river Ravee, which has lately swept away part of the wall inclosing the tomb, and threatens speedily to engulf the structure itself. The Maharajah gave it as a residence to a French officer of the name of Amise, who caused it to be cleared out and put in repair, but died shortly afterwards. His fate was considered by the Mahometans as retributive of his impiety in desecrating the sacred pile, which has since been closed up. Another of these huge ornamental tombs is styled that of Anarkalli, a youth, according to tradition, a favourite of one of the emperors, who, instigated by jealousy, having seen him smile at a lady of the imperial zenana, caused him to be put to death, by being built up in a brick cell, and this splendid mausoleum to be raised over him. Unfortunately, the tone of Mahometan morals is not such as to render the story incredible.\n\nThree miles north-east of Lahore is the garden of Shah Jehan, the Shalimar, or \"House of Joy.\" It is about half a mile long,* with three successive terraces, rising one above the other, and contains four hundred and fifty fountains, which throw up water, subsequently received into marble tanks. Runjeet Sing barbarously defaced this superb monument of oriental magnificence, by removing a large portion of the marble embellishments to his new capital, Amritsir.\n\nThe streets of Lahore, which are very narrow and filthy, contain numbers of lofty but gloomy houses, inclosed within extensive dead walls. The bazaars, though numerous, and\n\n* H\u00fcgel assigns much greater dimensions:\u2014\"Der ganze Garten der 1\u00bd Meile lang and \u00bc breit seyn mag\" (iii. 258).\nstocked with profusion of costly wares, are in general contracted and mean. There is an abundant supply of water from wells in the town, independent of the branch of the Ravee which washes the wall. The vicinity is fertile and well cultivated, being covered with the most luxuriant gardens and orchards. The great extent and size of the ruins scattered over the adjacent country bear evidence of the former greatness of the city. Von H\u00fcgel describes the scene as a huge mass of serais, palaces, and ruins, which must be seen, to form any notion of their multitude and extent. The population is still considerable, the streets being crowded in an extraordinary degree; yet in this respect, as well as in regard to trade, Lahore is greatly excelled by Amritsar, which has recently grown up into a successful rival; for though Runjeet Singh resided much at Lahore,* where he delighted to shew his state, Amritsar was both the spiritual and commercial capital of his dominions. Still Lahore, even in its decay, is a great city.\n\nVon H\u00fcgel says, that it stretches in a semicircular form four or five miles along the branch of the Ravee, and yet that if we judge from the ruins, it is not one-tenth part the size of what it once was. It is very difficult to make even any safe guess at its population, but from its extent and the multitudes which throng it, the number can scarcely be less than from 100,000 to 120,000. This indeed is a great declension from the amount in the time when it was the residence of the Mogul emperors, and was nine miles in length; the population then, probably, was eight or ten times the present number.\n\nLahore appears to have fallen into the hands of Mahmood of Ghiznee in 1009 on his advance to destroy Naugracut, and in 1152 it became the capital of the Gaznevide dynasty. In 1186 it was captured from the last Gaznevide by Sahub-ud-dein, the Gourian monarch. In 1523 it was taken by Sultan Baber, whose posterity made it a favourite residence, and raised it to its greatest splendour. In 1748 it fell into the hands of Ahmed Shah, the first Durani emperor. In 1799 Runjeet Singh was, by description of Runjeet Singh\u2019s magnificence. This (iii. 206\u2014384) will well repay perusal.\n\n* Our limits do not allow us to give even a brief abstract of Von H\u00fcgel\u2019s sep, Life of Runjeet Singh, 52.\n\n\u2020 Jacquemont states this to have taken place in 1801, and quotes Elphinstone, whose words however are, that Shah Zeman set out from the Punjab.\nZeman Shah, invested with the government of Lahore, with the title of Rajah. He immediately manifested his determination to possess the substance as well as the ensigns of power, by expelling three Sikh sirdars, who attempted to retain possession, and he thenceforward made it one of his favourite places of residence. Lahore is in lat. $31^\\circ 36'$, long. $74^\\circ 14'$.\n\nLAHOREE BUNDER, in Sinde, a village on the south or left bank of the Buggaur, or western branch of the Indus, twenty miles from the Pittee mouth. When visited by Alexander Hamilton, in 1699, it was the principal port of Sinde, being accessible for ships of 200 tons burthen, and at the close of the last century it was the seat of an English factory. It has since fallen to decay, in consequence of the contiguous channel having ceased to be navigable. Lat. $24^\\circ 31'$, long. $67^\\circ 24'$.\n\nLAHOUL, or LAWUR, in the north-east of the Punjab, is a small territory bounded on the north by Ladakh, east by Kulu, south by Burmawur, and west by Kishtawar. It is about sixty miles in length, and forty in breadth, and probably contains two thousand square miles. It is situate in lat. $32^\\circ 35'$\u2014$33^\\circ 20'$, long. $76^\\circ 30'$\u2014$77^\\circ 30'$. This territory is surrounded by lofty mountains, the Ritanka Pass on the south, having an elevation of thirteen thousand three hundred feet, and the Bara Lacha Pass, on the north-west, sixteen thousand five hundred; some peaks in the vicinity rising a thousand feet higher, and being covered with perpetual snow. Lahoul is traversed by innumerable torrents, the feeders of the Surajbhaga and the Chandrabhaga, the junction of which forms the river Chenaub. The elevation of the whole territory must be very great, as Kishtawar, above a hundred miles lower down the course of the rapid Chenaub, is more than five thousand feet above the level of the sea. There are no towns in this secluded tract, the only collections of habitations being two small hamlets, one called Gosha, the other Tandi, both situate close to the confluence of the Surajbhaga and Chandrabhaga. Notwithstanding the elevation of the surface, good crops of grain are produced. The inhabitants, a Tartar race, are\n\non his return to Peshawur, which he reached on the 30th of January, 1799. His guns were lost in the Hydaspes, on his return, by a sudden rising of the river; but they were afterwards dug out, and restored by Runjeet Singh and Saheb Singh.\n\n---\n\n1 Burnes' Rep. of Ports on the Indus, 2.\n2 A New Acc. of the East-Indies, i. 114.\n3 Vigne, Kashmir, i. 203.\n4 Moorcr.

The dress of both men and women consists of woollens, as well in summer as in winter. The cloth, which is thick, warm, soft, and smooth, is made in the country. The men wear coats, trousers, blankets, woollen caps, and grass sandals. They have also coats of sheepskin, with the wool shorn short, and worn next the skin. A woman in easy circumstances is generally loaded with coarse trinkets of silver, mother of pearl, amber, turquoises, coral, glass beads, and small bells, the tinkling of which may be heard at a considerable distance. The men, too, wear a profusion of earrings, armlets, and necklaces. Both sexes carry round their necks little leather bags containing amulets, given by their lamas or priests, for they are generally votaries of lamaism. The women carry leather pouches containing needle-cases, and other implements of female industry. The men bear about with them knives, steels, pieces of quartz, and tinder for striking light. Their hamlets contain in general from ten to twenty houses built of stone, two or three stories high, and with flat roofs well stored with faggots of willow or fir. The lowest story is a place of shelter for cattle, and access is obtained to the upper parts of the house by climbing up a notched stem of pine. These houses are built row above row on the steep sides of the mountains, each lower row serving as a step to the next above it.\n\nThe indigenous vegetation is scanty, as might be expected from the great general elevation. Moorcroft observes\u2014\u201cthere was little herbage, except stinking hyssop, abrotanum, artemisia, pimpernel, chenopodium, and sorrel. The dog-rose was abundant with a rich crop of scarlet hips.\u201d Gooseberries, currants, and apples are produced, of small size, and sour, austere taste. There are juniper bushes, dwarf tamarisks, firs, and willows. The traveller just quoted saw occasionally the red billed and red-footed crow, and a bird which he calls \u201cthe large Tartar raven.\u201d The inhabitants of Lahoul are subject to the ruler of Kulu, who is regarded as owner of the lands, and who receives from the cultivators a rent paid in grain.\n\nLAIGPOOR, in Sinde, a town near the left or eastern bank\nof the Indus, and on the route from Cutch to Hyderabad. Lat. 24\u00b0 34', long. 68\u00b0 28'.\n\nLAKAHURRAH, in the Punjab, a village on the route from Lahore to Mooltan, fifty miles north-east of the latter city. It is situated on the left bank of the Ravee, about thirty miles above its confluence with the Chenaub. Lat. 30\u00b0 30', long. 72\u00b0 3'.\n\nLAKA-KA-TURR, in the Great Desert of Sinde, a village on the route from Jessulmair to Wadole.

The surrounding country, which is rather fertile, is cultivated to a limited extent, and the road in this part of the route is good. Lat. 28\u00b0 5', long. 66\u00b0 2'.\n\nLAL KANYO, in the Punjab, a village situated in the Doab of the two rivers Chenaub and Jailum, and very near their junction. Lat. 31\u00b0 9', long. 72\u00b0 7'.\n\nLALABEG.\u2014A small expansion or valley in the Khyber Pass, nearly half-way between its extremities. It is remarkable for a tope, or artificial mound, of great dimensions and high antiquity; the dilapidation of which so far exposes its structure, as to show that it is solid and built of unburnt bricks laid in mortar. There are two square platforms, one rising above the other and displaying some attempts at architectural ornament. These are surmounted by a solid dome-shaped building, one hundred and ten yards in circumference and fifty feet high, the base being accessible by a flight of steps. Its origin and the date of its erection are unknown, but it has been supposed to be a dhagope or Buddhist monument, intended to preserve the remains of some eminent person of that persuasion; and at the same time to enshrine some relic connected with the same belief. Lat. 34\u00b0 8', long. 71\u00b0 17'.\n\nLALLEE, in the Punjab, a town in the Doab of Jinhut, and nearly equidistant from the Chenaub and the Jailum. It is situated in a level desert tract, and at the base of an inconsiderable eminence, the summit of which is occupied by a station of fakirs, and is also a much frequented place of pilgrimage. The population of the town is about 5,000. Lat. 31\u00b0 49', long. 72\u00b0 33'.\nLALLOO, in Sinde, a village on the road from Bukkur to Hyderabad, sixty miles south of the former town. Lat. 26\u00b0 52', long. 68\u00b0 46'.\n\nLALPOOR.\u2014A town on the north or left bank of the Kabool river, at the eastern extremity of the plain of Jelalabad. Here, the Caroppa route crosses by a ferry to the main road from the Khyber Pass to Jelalabad. The river at this point is sometimes fordable, and in April, 1842, was actually forded by a detachment of the British army, sent to expel the Afghan chief of the town and district. The elevation above the sea is 1,404 feet. Lat. 34\u00b0 17', long. 71\u00b0 4'.\n\nLANDEE KHANA, the most difficult part of Khyber Pass, lying about twenty-three miles from Kadam, the eastern entrance, and seven from the western entrance.* The pass here descends very steeply to the west, and is both narrow and rugged, so as to be with difficulty practicable for wheel-carriages. It is in one place a mere gallery, twelve feet wide, with the lofty rock rising like a wall on the north side, and a deep precipice on the south. In April, 1842, the British army, under General Pollock, when forcing the Khyber Pass, encamped near this spot. The elevation above the sea is 2,488 feet. Landee Khana is in lat. 34\u00b0 10', long. 71\u00b0 13'.\n\nLARAM MOUNTAINS, in Northern Afghanistan, a range dividing the valley of Suwat from that of Panjkora. Very little is known respecting it, except that it extends about sixty miles in a direction from north-east to south-west. Lat. 35\u00b0 20', long. 72\u00b0.\n\nLARGEBUR KAHREEZ, in Western Afghanistan, a village on the route from Kandahar to Herat, and two hundred miles north-west of the former place. It lies in a valley, bounded on both sides by very lofty mountains, estimated to have an altitude of ten thousand feet above the level of the sea. There is an abundant supply of good water from a Kahreez, or subterraneous aqueduct, and some cultivation is observable in the neighbourhood. Lat. 32\u00b0 32', long. 62\u00b0 54'.\n\nLARGEE, in Afghanistan, a dreary valley north of the Derajat, and separated from the Indus by a prolongation of the\n\n* Some consider this celebrated defile to terminate about a mile and a half westward of Landee Khana, whilst others extend it nearly to Duka, about seven miles farther in that direction.\nSalt range of mountains. It is about forty miles in length and eight or ten in breadth, arid, barren, and desert, being visited merely because the great route from north to south, along the western side of the Indus, passes through it. The middle part is in lat. $32^\\circ 20'$, long. $71^\\circ 15'$.\n\nLARKHANA, in Sinde, a town fourteen miles west of the Indus, situate on a great canal, which leaves the main stream of that river near Sukkur, and communicates with the Narra, or great western branch. The surrounding country, which is fertile, populous, and highly cultivated, is probably the finest tract in Sinde. The town is rudely fortified, and has a citadel at its western end, which, during the rule of the Talpoor dynasty, was the head depot of the artillery of the Ameers of Hyderabad. Larkhana is one of the principal grain marts of Sinde, and has a good bazaar, containing three hundred and seventy shops, well supplied with wares. The principal manufactures are the weaving of silk and cotton, which are of the yearly value of 6,000l.; and the place derives some commercial advantages from being situate on the great route from Southern Sinde to Cutch Gundava, Beloochistan, and Kandahar, through the Bolan Pass. The population, estimated at 10,000 or 12,000, bear a character of great profigacy. Near the town, on the banks of the Narra, is a large ruined fortress, called Maihota, built on a huge mound. Larkhana is in lat. $27^\\circ 30'$, long. $68^\\circ 16'$.\n\nLARKHARA.\u2014See LARKHANA.\n\nLASPISSOR MOUNTAINS, in Northern Afghanistan, a range subordinate to Hindoo Koosh, and south of it. They have been very slightly explored, but are represented to extend about fifty miles, in a direction generally from east to west. Lat. $36^\\circ$, long. $70^\\circ$.\n\nLAUSH, in Afghanistan, in the province of Seistan, is an ancient fort, belonging to a local chief of the Ishaukzye tribe of Afghans. It is, as the name vernacularly implies, built on a cliff. The cliff is four hundred feet high; the Furrah river flows at its eastern base, and is undermining the weak and friable mass so rapidly, that in a few years it must fall with the superincumbent buildings. There are many caves excavated in the cliff, having access and communication with each other by subterraneous passages, and intended as places of refuge for the inhabitants in cases of extreme danger. The people of the country consider\nthis fort impregnable, it being inaccessible on the side of the cliff, and rendered difficult of approach on the north and west by deep ravines. It could, however, be stormed from the south, and is so slenderly built that it might easily be destroyed by shells; or the whole might be overthrown by exploding a mine under the cliff. Shah Pussund, the Ishaukzye chief, obtained this fort by stratagem from Shah Kamran, of Herat, who has made repeated attempts to regain possession of it; these have hitherto been fruitless, but the failure of native attacks affords no ground for concluding it to be proof against the resources of European skill and science. The surrounding district, called Hak, is remarkably fertile and well watered, but has been miserably devastated by the frequent inroads made by the troops of Herat. Laush is in lat. $31^\\circ 51'$, long. $61^\\circ 46'$.\n\nLAVOR, in Afghanistan, a village in the district of Booneere, twenty miles north of the junction of the Kabool river with the Indus, in lat. $34^\\circ 12'$, long. $72^\\circ 18'$.\n\nLE, in Ladakh, or Middle Tibet, of which it is the capital, is situated about two miles from the right or northern bank of the Indus, here called Sin-kha-bab. A narrow sandy plain stretches between the river and a chain of mountains, which rise on the north about two thousand feet, and on this level space the town is built. It is enclosed by a wall surmounted at intervals with conical or square towers, and extending on each side to the summit of the mountains. The streets are very irregular and intricate; in many places they are covered over. The houses varying in height from one to three stories, and in some instances extending to more, are built partly of stone, partly of unburned brick; being whitewashed, they have a lively appearance. They generally have wooden balconies in front. The roofs are flat and ill-constructed of the trunks of poplars, covered with a layer of willow twigs, and this with another of straw, a coat of mud overlaying the whole, which at last constitutes a very insufficient defence against rain. The walls taper as they rise, so that the outer surface slopes inwards. The rain and cold are very imperfectly excluded by wooden shutters, or strong curtains drawn across the windows. There are no chimneys, and the wood-smoke is consequently offensive and suffocating, often producing severe and permanent injury to the eyes. The furniture is very rude, and withal very scanty. The floor sometimes serves for bed, chair, and table, while sheep, goats,\nand other stock, not unfrequently lodge in the same room with the family. The palace of the Raja, though simple in construction, and rude in finish, yet being several stories high, and having a front of two hundred and fifty feet, is a conspicuous object. There are several temples as rudely built as the houses. The hereditary Raja, a votary of Lamaism, was deposed by Guolab Singh, the powerful Sikh chieftain of Jamu, who now holds the country.\n\nLe is important as the great rendezvous for the intercourse between the Punjab and Chinese Tartary, and the principal mart for the sale of shawl-wool brought from the latter region. It has above five hundred* houses, and probably four thousand inhabitants. Its elevation above the sea is stated by Moorcroft\\(^2\\) to be more than 11,000 feet, and by Vigne\\(^3\\) to be about 10,000. Lat. \\(34^\\circ 11'\\), long. \\(72^\\circ 14'\\).\n\nLEHREE,\\(^1\\) in Beloochistan, a town of Cutch Gundava, is situate near the southern base of the mountains, connecting the Suliman range with the Hala. Pottinger\\(^2\\) describes it as having from a thousand to fifteen hundred houses, and surrounded by a mud rampart, strengthened with bastions. Here, in the beginning of 1841, Nusser Khan, the son of the slain Mehrab Khan of Kelat, assembled an army of about four thousand men, attempting to maintain a post among the neighbouring hills; but being attacked by a British force, consisting of nine hundred sepoys, sixty irregular cavalry, and two field pieces, commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Marshal, he was utterly routed and fled, accompanied by only two men.\\(^3\\) Lehree is in lat. \\(29^\\circ 14'\\), long. \\(68^\\circ 24'\\).\n\nLEIA,\\(^1\\) in the Punjab, an important commercial town, situate on a small branch of the Indus, about three miles eastward of the main stream. It is a place of great business, not only in direct but in transit trade, as it lies on the main road from Hindostan to the west by the Kaheree ferry, and is, besides, the mart for the abundant and rich produce of the surrounding fertile country. The principal articles of sale are indigo, madder, sugar, silk, cotton, wool, iron, copper, groceries of various kinds, ghee, or clarified butter, and grain. It yields a revenue of a hundred and twenty-seven thousand rupees. The population is 15,000, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) E.I.C.

It rises on the southern slope of the mountain bounding Kashmir on the north-east, in lat. $34^\\circ 10'$, long. $75^\\circ 35'$, and at an elevation of probably not less than 14,000 feet. Its current is in consequence very rapid until it reaches the alluvial tract in the bottom of the valley, where it becomes a dull and muddy stream. After a course of about forty-five miles in a south-westerly direction, it falls into the Jailum, about five miles below Islamabad, in lat. $33^\\circ 40'$, long. $75^\\circ 3'$. At the confluence, the volume of water of the Lidur is scarcely inferior to that of the Jailum.\n\n**LILLEAH**, in Sinde, a village situate near the left bank of the Indus. Lat. $26^\\circ 42'$, long. $67^\\circ 59'$.\n\n**LODHU**, in Sinde, a village on the route from Bukkur to Hyderabad, and thirty-two miles south of the former place. Lat. $27^\\circ 16'$, long. $68^\\circ 54'$.\n\n**LOGURH**, in Afghanistan, a district of considerable extent, south of the city of Kabool. It extends up the northern slope of the high land of Ghuznee, and, as its elevation in all parts exceeds six thousand feet, the climate is very severe in winter. The Logurh river with its various feeders intersects and drains this district, which, being fertile, well watered, and cultivated with much care, is one of the most productive parts of the country. Lat. $34^\\circ 20'$, long. $69^\\circ$.\n\n**LOGURH**, a river of Afghanistan, rises south-west of the city of Kabool, in a volcanic district of singular conformation and appearance, and which is also called Logurh. After a course of about eighty miles, it falls, about ten miles north-east of Kabool, into the river of the same name, in lat. $34^\\circ 32'$, long. $69^\\circ 8'$. It is superior to the Kabool river in length, and perhaps equal in volume of water.\n\n**LOLAB.**\u2014A long narrow valley, embosomed in the Green Mountains, forming the northern boundary of Kashmir. It in one place has a large level circular expansion about five and a half miles in diameter, described by Vigne as realizing all that the imagination can picture of quietude and retirement. In the\ncentre is a morass which appears to have been once a lake; the sides are verdant, and overgrown in many places with jungle. It seems to be a sort of *Nephelococcygia*, or metropolis for the birds of Kashmir, which every evening congregate here in vast numbers. Ravens, crows, and jackdaws appear in great flocks in the air above the tops of the enclosing mountain, and all moving towards Lolab. As soon as they are sufficiently near their resting place, they dart down with surprising rapidity, and alight in such countless numbers as literally to blacken the ground.\n\nLolab valley is drained by a small river of the same name, which, rising in the expansion just mentioned, holds a circuitous course, first in a westerly, and then in a south-easterly direction, and at the distance of about thirty-five miles from its source falls into the Jailum, in lat. $34^\\circ 13'$, long. $74^\\circ 17'$. The singular place of concourse for birds is in lat. $33^\\circ 34'$, long. $74^\\circ 52'$.\n\n**LOLUM**, or more properly Lolur, in Kashmir, a village thirty-two miles north of the town of Sirinagur. Lat. $34^\\circ 26'$, long. $74^\\circ 24'$.\n\n**LOODHUN**, in the Punjab, a village situate on a watercourse connected with the river Ghara, from the right bank of which it is distant about four miles, and sixty miles south-east of Mooltan. Lat. $29^\\circ 51'$, long. $72^\\circ 27'$.\n\n**LOONEE**, in Afghanistan, a village on the route from Ghuznee to Dera Ismael Khan, about thirty-five miles west of the latter town. It is situate on the Gomul river. Lat. $31^\\circ 54'$, long. $70^\\circ 20'$.\n\n**LORA**, a river of Southern Afghanistan, rises about fifty miles north-east of Quetta, or Shawl, in lat. $30^\\circ 49'$, long. $67^\\circ 20'$, and, after flowing south-west for a distance of about eighty miles, is lost in the sands of the desert of Khorasan. Its water is briny. The Rogani Pass, from Sewestan to Shorawuck, winds along its course. It is crossed, five miles north of Hykulzie, by the route from Shawl to Kandahar, and has there a channel between forty and fifty feet deep. In April, the water was found to be only seven or eight yards wide and two feet deep. The name is generic, signifying \"river,\" in the language of the natives.\n\n**LORA**, in Afghanistan, on the route from Ghuznee to Kabul, and nineteen miles north-east of the former place, is a district containing some walled villages, and abounding in streams,\nwhich render the road through it difficult. Lat. $33^\\circ 46'$, long. $68^\\circ 27'$.\n\n**LORGURKARA**, in Bhawlpoo, a village on the route from E.I.C. Ms. Doc. Khanpoor to Subzulcote, and twenty-six miles north-east of the latter place. Lat. $28^\\circ 22'$, long. $70^\\circ 5'$.\n\n**LOSUR,** in Ladakh, a village of Spiti, is situate near the confluence of the Losur river with the river of Pecno. It is the last inhabited spot which travellers find in ascending the course of the latter river, and has an elevation of about 13,400 feet. Above this part of the valley, through which the river flows, the mountains rise in mural cliffs so steep that no snow can rest on their faces, though it lies deeply on their tops, which are for the most part flattened, forming table-lands. The general character of the soil and atmosphere is excessive aridity, but in some places patches of fertility, at the bases of the declivities, are rendered productive by means of irrigation. On one of these slips is situated the village of Losur, and the appearance of this singularly secluded place, as described by Gerard, is far from repulsive. \"Lofty as the level of Losur is, there is little in the landscape to betray its position, when viewed in summer, embosomed in flourishing crops, and herds of shawl-wool goats. Yaks and horses meet the eye upon the high declivities of the mountains, and an ardent sunshine keeps the air looming from the effects of mirage.\" The inhabitants are Tibetans or Tartars of the Mongolian type, and their complexions are darker than in the low and sultry plains. When the ground is covered with snow, their black figures contrast strikingly and somewhat grotesquely with the dazzling whiteness of the surface on which they move. Losur is in lat. $32^\\circ 8'$, long. $78^\\circ 5'$.\n\n**LOSUR**, a small river of Ladakh, is formed by the junction of two streams, the one flowing in a south-easterly direction from the Parang La Pass, the other north-easterly, from the range which, on its farther or western side, sends numerous feeders to the Chinab. Lower down, the Losur river receives, near the village of Losur, a stream called the Pin, or Peeno, and thence-forwards is generally known by the name of the river of Spiti, which, after a further course of about fifty miles, generally in a south-easterly direction, falls into the Sutlej close to Numgeea, in lat. $31^\\circ 48'$, long. $78^\\circ 38'$.\n\n**LUGGAREE**, in Sinde, a village on the route from Hydera.\nbad to Omercote, and sixty miles west of the latter place. It is situate on the right bank of the Poorana river. Lat. $25^\\circ 22'$, Long. $68^\\circ 51'$.\n\nLUGHMAN, in Afghanistan, a district north of Jelalabad, and bounded on the north by Hindoo Koosh; on the east, by the river of Kama; on the south, by the river of Kabool; and on the west, by the river Alishang. It forms part of the province of Jelalabad, and thither the ruthless Mahomed Akbar Khan conveyed the British prisoners reserved from the massacre at Khoord Kabool. It is forty miles long, thirty miles broad, and, though having a rugged surface, is fertile, well watered, and populous. Its name is said to be correctly Langhan; acquired, according to Baber, from its containing the tomb of Lam, or Lamech, the father of Noah. The inhabitants are Tajiks, and speak a patois called Lughmani, compounded principally of Persian and Pushtoo. The district yielded annually Rs. 113,000 under Dost Mahomed Khan. It lies between lat. $34^\\circ 25'$\u2014$35^\\circ$, long. $70^\\circ$\u2014$70^\\circ 40'$.\n\nLUK BAWUN, in Kashmir, a village situate at the north-western extremity of a long ridge of green hills, which, extending from the Snowy Panjal, gradually diminish in height and size, till they terminate on the plain. Though now scarcely containing half a dozen houses, Luk Bawun was once a considerable place. Here, are the ruins of a large bath and an extensive stone-built tank. Lat. $33^\\circ 36'$, long. $75^\\circ 6'$.\n\nLUKA, in the Punjab, a town on the route from Ferozpoor to Mooltan. It is situate in the Doab between the Ghara and the Chinab. Lat. $29^\\circ 50'$, long. $72^\\circ 20'$.\n\nLUKH, in Beloochistan, a pass twenty miles west of Belah, on the route from that town to Kedje. The word means a Pass. Lat. $26^\\circ 10'$, long. $66^\\circ 9'$.\n\nLUKHOKI, in the Punjab, a small town in the Doab between the Ghara and the Ravee, is situate about three miles from the right or west bank of the former river, and on the route from Ferozpoor to Mooltan. Lat. $30^\\circ$, long. $72^\\circ 41'$.\n\nLUKHSUR, in Beloochistan, a village on the route from Belah to Kedje, and forty miles west of the former town. Lat. $26^\\circ 14'$, long. $65^\\circ 52'$.\n\nLUKKEE MOUNTAINS, in Sindc, are a considerable range connected with the Hala, or brahooic mountains of Beloochistan.\nWith the Jutteel, the Keertar, the Pubb, and some other ranges less known, the Lukkee contributes to give character to the singularly wild tract constituting the western part of Sinde, extending between Bcloochistan and the alluvial tract on the Indus, and also between the desert of Shikarpore and Kur-rachee. The Lukkee is the most eastern of these ranges, and runs from the Jutteel south-eastward, towards the high lands opposite Hyderabad, being known in different parts by the various appellations of the Eeree Lukkee, Daran Lukkee, and Hallar Lukkee. These mountains are in general of recent formation, containing a vast profusion of marine exuvia. \"The organic remains of former ages,\" observes Burnes, \"are innumerable; the asteroid, the cockle, the oyster, the nummulite, and almost all kinds of sea-shells, may be collected on the Lukkee range.\" Huge fissures, apparently produced by earthquakes, traverse this range, which, in the frequent occurrence of hot springs and sulphureous exhalations, exhibit signs of volcanic action. Some parts appear to be of more ancient formation, as they produce lead, antimony, and copper. The elevation of the highest part of this dreary and sterile range is estimated at from 1,500 to 2,000 feet. Between the town of Lukkee and that of Schwan, the mountain has a nearly perpendicular face, about six hundred feet high towards the Indus, between which and the precipice, there was at one time a road, though in some places so narrow, that only a single camel could pass at a time. In 1839, this defile was washed away by the turbulent river, which now sweeps along the base of the cliff. The length of the Lukkee range is about fifty miles.\n\nLat. 25\u00b0 30', long. 67\u00b0 50'.\n\nLUKKEE, NORTHERN, in Sinde, a large town in ruins, on the route from Shikarpore to Lukkur, and twelve miles southeast of the former place. Under the Durani sway, it was wealthy and populous, but since it passed into the power of the Ameers of Sinde, it has fallen into utter decay. It has now scarcely an inhabitant, and as its abandonment has been recent and sudden, the appearance is singular, the houses being entire and habitable, yet untenanted, or affording shelter only to a few marauders. In the time of its prosperity, it yielded an annual revenue of a hundred thousand rupees. It is ten miles from the right bank of the Indus. Lat. 27\u00b0 48', long. 68\u00b0 46'.

Panj. i. 359.\ntown of the same name is situated a hundred and twenty miles farther south, for an account of which see Lukkee, Southern.\n\nLUKKEE, SOUTHERN, in Sinde, a town situate a short distance south of Schwan, close to the west bank of the Indus, and adjacent to the entrance of the Lukkee Pass. Its site is picturesque, being near a lake a mile wide, and several miles in length, which appears to have been at one time a reach of the Indus. The Lukkee mountains, sloping down to the west of the town, and a little to the north, abut on that river, which sweeps along their rocky base. Close to the town is a spring of sulphureous water, which has a temperature of 102\u00b0, and flows from the base of a calcareous precipice six hundred feet high. Lat. 26\u00b0 14', long. 68\u00b0 1'. This town must be distinguished from another of the same name, situate a hundred and twenty miles farther north, for an account of which see Lukkee, Northern.\n\nLULLEEANA, in the Punjab, a village twenty-six miles south of Lahore. Lat. 31\u00b0 16', long. 74\u00b0 24'.\n\nLUNDYE, or, RIVER OF PANJKORA, in Afghanistan, one of the principal tributaries of the Kabool river, rises on the southern declivity of Hindoo Koosh, in the unexplored region north of Panjkora. It flows from north-east to south-west, and having received the Sewat river from the east, and some others of less size, falls into the Kabool river between the Khyber mountains and the Indus, and in lat. 34\u00b0 10', long. 71\u00b0 47'.\n\nLUNGUR, in North-western Afghanistan, a village thirty-two miles south-east of the town of Siri Pool. Lat. 35\u00b0 50', long. 66\u00b0 13'.\n\nLUR, in Western Afghanistan, a village with a deserted fort on the route from Kandahar to Herat, and one hundred miles north-west of the former place. It is well supplied with water from subterraneous aqueducts, and there is considerable cultivation in the vicinity. Forage also can be obtained, the spontaneous growth of shrubs and grasses. Lat. 32\u00b0 9', long. 64\u00b0 11'.\n\nLUREE, in the Punjab, a village situate on the left bank of the Swan river, on the route from Attock to Julalpoor, and fifty miles south-east of the former town. Lat. 33\u00b0 30', long. 73\u00b0 1'.\n\nLURGE, in Afghanistan, a village forty-eight miles southwest of Ghuznee. Lat. 33\u00b0 3', long. 67\u00b0 44'.\nLURROO, or DURROO, in Kashmir, on the route from the Banial Pass to Islamabad, and about eight miles south of the latter place. At the time of Forster's visit, it was a small but very populous town. It does not appear to be mentioned by Vigne or other late travellers, and it is not improbable that it may have been completely ruined in the dreadful depopulation which, within the last few years, has afflicted Kashmir. Wilson conjectures it to be identical with Lolora or Looloo, mentioned in the Ayeen Akbery to have had eighty crore of houses. Abulfazel, however, states that Looloo was in Kamraj, or the western division of Kashmir, and Lurroo is, according to Foster's account, in the south-eastern part of the valley. Lat. 33\u00b0 36', long. 75\u00b0 6'.\n\nLUS, or LUSSA, a province of Beloochistan, bounded on the north by Jhalawan; on the east by Sinde, from which, along its whole course, it is separated by the Hubb river; on the south by the Indian Ocean; and on the west by Mekran. It lies between lat. 24\u00b0 50'\u201426\u00b0 15', long. 65\u00b0 28'\u201467\u00b0 18', is sixty miles in breadth from north to south, one hundred and ten miles in length from east to west, and five thousand two hundred square miles in superficial extent. It is in general rather level, especially towards the sea-coast (where the soil is impregnated with salt), and along the shore rises into sand-hills of moderate height. In the eastern part a range of mountains extends from north to south, being the continuation of the Hala range, known by the names of the Pubb or Brahoic mountains, and terminating at the sea in Cape Monze. Across this range, in lat. 25\u00b0 23', is an important pass, leading from Sinde to Sonmeeanee, and the route by which, proceeding westward, forms the prolonged sea-coast line of communication with Persia. In the western part of the province is another mountain range, similarly running north and south. The country between these is level, or slightly broken by low hills, having an unproductive soil covered with stunted woods, or scanty pasture, grazed by horned cattle, goats, sheep, and numerous herds of camels. There are two rivers or torrents, the Poorally and the Hubb. The Poorally rises in Jhalawan, crosses the northern frontier, and, taking a course nearly due south, falls into the sea a few miles west of Sonmeeanee. It is in general a shallow stream, rolling over a wide and rugged bed, but, when swollen with rain, it becomes a\nfurious torrent. The total length of its course is about a hundred miles. The Hubb rises in the north-east angle of the province, and runs along a rocky channel among the ravines and valleys of the Brahooic mountains, with so small a body of water, that, in the dry season, the current does not reach the sea. In the wet season it falls into the Indian Ocean a little to the left of Cape Monze, after a course of a hundred and ten miles. Such a country must of necessity be pastoral, the scanty population that exists being confined to the course of the Poorally, and producing only a little grain, pulse, and tobacco. The people are supported almost entirely on the produce of their flocks and herds, pasturing great numbers of goats, cows, buffaloes, and camels. They consume but a small quantity of grain, and most of that is imported. The inhabitants are called Lumris or Numaris, and speak a dialect similar to that of Sinde. They are governed by a chief, called the Jam, whose residence is at the little town of Bela, hence considered as the capital. He is a vassal of the Khan of Kelat, to whom, in time of war, he supplies a contingent of troops, which, on the last occasion, amounted to four thousand men. His annual revenue is computed to be 25,000 rupees, derived almost exclusively from custom duties. The only places which can properly be called towns are Bela, Sonmeeanee, and Lyaree. Bela, the capital, has, according to Carless, eight hundred houses, and a population of about 5,000. Sonmeeanee has a population of about 5,000, and one thousand houses. Lyaree is very small and inconsiderable. The population of the whole province is probably 60,000.\n\nLUTTABUND PASS, in Afghanistan, is the most northern of the four collateral passes through the Kurkutcha range. It is about six miles long, and little frequented; the caravans generally travelling by the Huft Kotal pass farther south, especially in winter, as then the Luttabund is blocked up by snow. It is probably about 7,000 feet high. On arriving at the highest part of this pass from the eastward, the traveller has a view of the city of Kabool, twenty-five miles distant, to the west. Lat. 34\u00b0 21', long. 69\u00b0 28'.\n\nLYAREE, in Beloochistan, a town or rather hamlet in the province of Lus, at the head of the estuary of the river Poorally, and twenty-five miles from its mouth. Pottinger states it to contain from sixteen hundred to eighteen hundred houses, which\nunquestionably is an exaggerated estimate. Outram styles it a \"paltry little village,\" and Masson says that it contains \"about twenty mud houses, inhabited by Hindoos, and eighty huts, the abode of Mahometans.\" This statement, though sufficiently accordant with Outram's account, is quite at variance with that of Pottinger, but is in all probability far nearer the fact. There is an insignificant manufactory of salt here. Lat. 25\u00b0 37', long. 66\u00b0 25'.\n\nM.\n\nMACHEE, in Beloochistan, a village of Cutch Gundava, E.I.C. Ms. Doc. situate a little to the west of the road from the town of Gundava to Larkhana, forty miles south of the former, and fifty north-west of the latter place. Lat. 27\u00b0 54', long. 67\u00b0 38'.\n\nMADDEHJEE, in Sinde, a considerable village on the route from Sukkur to Larkhana, and twenty-eight miles west of the former place. It contains about one hundred and fifty houses and twenty shops. A plentiful supply of water is procurable from six wells, lined with burned brick, and there is convenient encamping ground on the south-west of the village. Forage for both camels and horses is in abundance. The road in this part of the route runs through thin jungle. Lat. 27\u00b0 36', long. 68\u00b0 34'.\n\nMAGAR TALAO (Alligator's pool),* in Sinde, a collection of hot springs nine miles north-east of Kurrachee, and swarming with alligators. De la Hoste states that there are two hundred of those animals in a small space not exceeding a hundred and twenty yards in diameter. Some of them are very large, and their appearance, basking in the sun, is not unlike a dry date-tree. They belong to several fakirs, who have attached themselves to the tomb of a Mahometan considered by his countrymen to have been a character of peculiar sanctity. Hence is the name Muggea Peer, by which the place is popularly known among Europeans,\n\n* From an alligator, and a pool.\nbeing a corruption of Magar Peer or Pir, \"the alligator's saint.\" These thermal springs are situate amidst rocky and very barren hills, and spring out of the bottom of a small fertile valley, thickly wooded with date-trees and acacias, over which the white dome of the shrine is visible. Adjacent to the shrine are a few highly ornamented tombs, the architectural style of which resembles that of some English structures of the age of Elizabeth. Allen says, \"The devices were principally scroll and diamond work; the carving, though not very bold, was elaborate in design and neatly executed.\" The principal spring issues from the rock on which the shrine is built, and has a temperature of about 98\u00b0, the water being perfectly clear, and of a sulphurous smell. Another spring, about half a mile distant, has a temperature of 130\u00b0. The water, received into tanks, forms a grateful retreat for the alligators. On occasion of a stranger's visit, the fakirs regale these animals with a carcase of a goat, and their struggles and contests to secure the prey constitute a scene at once ludicrous and disgusting. They are very tame, and never seek to injure human beings. It is remarkable that they are genuine alligators, and totally distinct from the guryal, or long-snouted crocodile, which abounds in the Indus, a short distance to the east. The fakirs live in a few mud huts, the only human habitations in this vicinity. Lat. 25\u00b0 2', long. 67\u00b0 5'.\n\nMAGHRIBEE, in Sinde, a town situated on the Piniaree, a branch of the Indus. Below the town a dam has been thrown across the Piniaree about fifty miles from its mouth. It is forty feet broad, and of proportionable height, but the water in the swell makes its way through numerous small openings to the channel below, called the Goongra, which is navigable to the sea, discharging itself by the Sir mouth. The Piniaree is also navigable from the town upwards to the Indus. The traffic is almost exclusively in rice, which being produced abundantly in Sinde, is exported down this channel to Cutch. Population 5,000. Lat. 24\u00b0 11', long. 68\u00b0 17'.\n\nMAHER PEER, in Sinde, a village on the middle route from Roree to Hyderabad, and forty miles south-west of the former town.

The road in this part of the route lies over a level alluvial country, in general waste, but having occasional spots of cultivation, and intersected by watercourses, rendering the passage of wheel carriages difficult. Lat. 27\u00b0 26', long. 68\u00b0 16'.\n\nMAHOMED KHAN KA TANDA, in Sinde, a town on the route from Hyderabad to Cutch, and thirty miles south-east of the former place. It is situated on the bank of the Fulailee branch of the Indus, and the neighbouring country, though near the border of the desert, is fertile and well cultivated. It is one of the most thriving places in Sinde, in consequence of its manufactures and of the transit trade from Cutch. During the Talpoor sway in Sinde, it was usually the residence of one of the subordinate Amceers. Lat. 25\u00b0 5', long. 68\u00b0 40'.\n\nMAHOMED KHAN NOHUR, in Sinde, a village situated on the left bank of the Indus. Lat. 28\u00b0 19', long. 69\u00b0 34'.\n\nMAHOMED KHAN TANDA, in Sinde, a village on the route from Sehwan to Kurrachee, and seventy miles north-east of the latter place.

Lat. 25\u00b0 46', long. 69\u00b0 22'.\n\nMAIDAN, in Afghanistan, a beautiful and fertile valley through which the route from Kandahar to Kabool passes. The village of Maidan, the principal in the valley, is situated on the left or north bank of the Kabool river, and twenty-two miles south-west of the city of that name. Here, in September, 1842, the British army under General Nott, in the advance on Kabool, defeated a superior Afghan force. Lat. 34\u00b0 21', long. 68\u00b0 44'.\n\nMAIMOE GHAT (or FERRY), in the Punjab, situated on the Ghara river. By this ferry the route from Hindostan passes to the town of Pauk Petten, where is a celebrated shrine of a Mahometan saint. In consequence of this, the ferry is much\nfrequented at the time appointed for his festival. Lat. $30^\\circ 16'$ long. $73^\\circ 11'$.\n\nMAIMOODDA, in Bhawlpoo, situate on the left bank of the river Ghara.

Here is an idol called Bawun, an object of great veneration to the superstitious Hindoos. It is without its head, which is supposed to be at Jewala Muki, and to breathe forth\nthe perpetual fire issuing from the rock there. Malekra is a neat clean-looking place, built on the side of a hill, traversed by the road from Nadaun to Kot Kangra. Lat. $31^\\circ 57'$, long. $76^\\circ 4'$.\n\nMALGEERK, in Afghanistan, a village situate on the right bank of the Helmund river, three miles south of the town of Giriskh.

Lat. $34^\\circ 17'$, long. $70^\\circ 4'$.\n\nMANASA BUL, in Kashmir, a beautiful lake, which discharges its water into the Jailum on the right or north side. It is a mile and a half long, three-quarters of a mile wide, and very deep; bounded on the west by picturesque hills, while on the north and east the successive ranges of the northern Kashmirian mountains rise in great grandeur, and on the south a fertile and verdant plain stretches to the Jailum. It is altogether, according to Von H\u00fcgel, one of the most beautiful spots in existence. On the northern bank are the remains of a palace built by Nur Jehan, the celebrated Queen of Jehangir, the Mogul emperor. Here the substratum of the soil is of limestone, which is reduced to lime in a large kiln belonging to the government. Lat. $34^\\circ 13'$, long. $74^\\circ 35'$.\n\nMANCHAR, in Sinde, a lake formed by the expansion of\nthe Narra, a branch proceeding from the Indus, on the western side. The Narra flows into the lake on the north, the redundant water being discharged on the south-east by the river Arul, which has a course of about twelve miles, and, flowing by Sehwan, falls into the Indus about four miles below that town. The lake is nearly of a circular form when the water is low, and is then about ten miles in diameter. During the inundation, it expands so as to be twenty miles long, the breadth remaining much as before. The space left uncovered by the receding water is sown with grain, especially wheat, which yields very heavy crops. Though shallow at the sides, the lake has a considerable depth of water in the middle, and so great is the abundance of fine fish, according to Burnes, that a thousand boats are employed in the fishery. They are taken by spearing, the great quantity of weeds preventing the employment of nets. In the season when the lotus is in blossom,\u00b2 the lake presents a very beautiful appearance, as its surface, farther than the eye can reach, is covered with an unbroken succession of bloom and leaves. Lat. 26\u00b0 15', long. 67\u00b0 40'.\n\nMANGA, in the Punjab, a small town on the left or east bank of the Ravee.

Some broad steps (now mostly ruined) lead to the base of the pile round the base to a moulding on which are pilasters about four feet high and six feet asunder; these have plain capitals, and support a cornice marked with parallel lines and beadings. The whole of this may be seven or eight feet high, from the uppermost step to the top of the cornice. The building then retires, leaving a ledge of a foot or two broad, from which rises a perpendicular wall about six feet high; about a foot above the ledge is a fillet formed by stones projecting a very little from the wall, and at the top of the wall is a more projecting cornice.\u201d Above this complex basement, which may be taken to be from sixteen to twenty feet high, rises a dome approaching in shape to a hemisphere, but truncated and flat near the summit. \u201cIt was built of large pieces of a hard stone common in the neighbourhood (which appeared to be composed of petrified vegetable matter), mixed with smaller pieces of a sandy stone. The greater part of the outside was cased with the forementioned stone cut quite smooth.\u201d These stones are about three feet and a half long,* and one and a half broad, and are so placed that the ends only are exposed. Elphinstone and his party considered it decidedly Grecian. Moorcroft, on the contrary, is of opinion that \u201cit has not at all the character of a Grecian edifice. It has a much greater resemblance to the monumental structures of the Tibetans.\u201d Erskine, as quoted by Wilson, observes of it: \u201cAlthough its origin is unknown, yet, in its hemispherical form and whole appearance, it carries with it a sufficient proof that it was a magnificent dahgope or Buddha shrine, constructed at a remote period by persons of the Buddhist faith.\u201d In 1830, General Ventura, in the service of Runjeet Sing, sank a perpendicular shaft in the centre of the platform on the summit, and at various depths found repositories, one below another, at the intervals of several feet. These contained\n\n* Hough remarks: \u201cThe difficulty in the execution of this work consists in the great size of the stones, which it would be difficult to remove from a quarry.\u201d Moorcroft observes, \u201cThey were, however, but pebbles, compared with the blocks we had seen in the ruined buildings of Kashmir, and the workmanship was equally inferior.\u201d (ii. 311.)\ncoins of gold, silver, and copper, boxes and vessels of iron, brass, copper, and gold. The copper coins were considered to be some of those struck by the Indo-Scythian kings, Kadphises or Kanerkes, who are thought to have reigned about the latter part of the first and the commencement of the second century. There are fifteen other topes in this neighbourhood. One of these opened by Court, another officer in the service of Runjeet Sing * was found to contain a coin of Julius C\u00e6sar, one of Marc Antony, the Triumvir, and none of a much later date. The country around bears traces of having been formerly very populous, and the inhabitants assert that it was the site of an immense city. Burnes and Wilson consider it the site of the Taxila of the Greeks, the Taksha-sila of the Hindoos, the greatest city between the Indus and the Hydaspes (the Jailum).

This demolition took place to avenge a frightful massacre perpetrated here in 1839 by the Afghans, on a large body of the camp-followers of the army of the Indus. Above two hundred of the natives of Hindostan, who had accompanied the invading force, joined a caravan proceeding from Herat to the Derajat, and being treacherously induced at Maroof by the Kafilabashee, or head of the caravan, to deliver up their arms to his safe keeping, were, with the assistance of the natives, all massacred.

It consists of about four hundred houses, defended by a fort, and standing in a plain of moderate extent, from whence roads proceed to Peshawur, Badakshan, and Yarkund. The climate is in general temperate, though much snow falls on the neighbouring mountains, which are rocky, bare, and lofty. There is some trade here, which appears to be principally in the hands of the rajah, who receives from Yarkund chintzes and other cottons, boots and shoes, metals, coral, pearls, tea, sugar, and horses. The return is principally made in slaves, and this unscrupulous ruler, if he cannot kidnap a sufficient number from the neighbouring states, does not hesitate to seize and sell his own subjects. The men are tall and athletic, but very cow-\nardly; the women coarse and profligate. The heads of these people are conical, in consequence of a custom which prevails of moulding them into that shape by tying a strong band round the head of the infant shortly after birth. The grain cultivated is generally wheat or barley. Grapes are produced in great abundance and excellence, but rarely made into wine, as the people are Mahometans, principally of the Shia persuasion, though the rajah is a Sunni.

Notwithstanding its situation below those vast mountain masses, it is devoid of streams or other natural means of irrigation, but consisting almost entirely of very fertile alluvial earth, it bears, where cultivated, abundant crops of wheat, barley, and most kinds of grain, excepting rice. The great depopulation of Kashmir, however, has rendered it, for the most part, a waste, presenting a surface of the finest verdure, unbroken by tree, shrub, or human habitation. With the exception of a fakir's dwelling, recently fallen in ruins, \"There is not a vestige of a human habitation upon the green waste. A solitary villager may be seen passing from one district to another; a few cattle may be grazing in the distance, and a shepherd or two may be seen collecting their flocks for the night, whilst the bleating of their charge only breaks in upon the silence without disturbing the extraordinary tranquillity of the scene.\" Moorcroft seems greatly to underrate its extent in stating it to be \"commonly a mile in breadth.\" H\u00fcgel assigns to it a breadth of four or five miles in every direction, and adds, that it appeared almost inter-\n\n* H\u00fcgel also mentions the solitude and unbroken silence of this fertile plain, which formerly was irrigated by means of a great aqueduct now completely ruined. \"Das Plateau ist, wie mit der Hand geebnet v\u00f6llig baum- und strauchlos, kein Feld, keine H\u00fctte ist auf demselben. Spuren fr\u00fcherer Bebauung sind jedoch durch die noch bestehende Abtheilung in Felder sichtbar; sie wurden vormals durch eine grosse, nun zerst\u00f6rte Wasserleitung bew\u00e4ssert.\" Jacquemont, on the contrary, states that it was almost entirely under corn crops:\u2014\"Le plateau de Motonone est presque enti\u00e8rement cultiv\u00e9 en c\u00e9r\u00e9ales diverses.\" The discrepancy, however, is explainable by the supposition that the desolating change took place between 1831, the time of Jacquemont's visit, and 1835, when the Karywa was surveyed by H\u00fcgel, probably by Vigne.\nminable from an optical illusion frequently occurring from the state of the atmosphere in the valley. This table-land is elevated from 250 to 300 feet above the great alluvial plain of Kashmir. On a slight eminence at its western extremity, are situated the ruins of a very ancient building, which excites in all spectators, feelings of admiration approaching to awe, by the elaborate skill displayed in its construction, and the simple, massive, and sublime character of its architecture. It is built of huge blocks of hard compact limestone, the black colour of which adds to its gloomy grandeur. The blocks* are generally from six to nine feet in length, having proportionate breadth and thickness. This extraordinary monument of early civilization consists of an outer colonnade, inclosing an area in which stands the principal building detached. The shape of this inclosure is rectangular; the length being two hundred and forty-four feet, the breadth a hundred and fifty.\u2020 The longer sides face north and south. Within each of the four sides a row of pillars is carried along the entire extent of the building. Each pillar has a shaft seven feet long and a foot and a half in diameter: a pedestal two feet and a half high; a capital four feet high: the whole height of the inclosing peristyle is about fifteen feet. The pillars, which are fluted, are six feet and a half distant from each other, and a foot and a quarter from the wall. In each interval between the pillars is an entrance seven feet high and four feet wide, into a small chamber or recess six feet deep from front to back, and constructed in the body of the wall, which, exclusive of the chambers, is six feet thick. Stone blocks of regular dimensions, eight feet long and two feet wide, form the roof of all. The workmanship throughout is excellent, and in an elaborate yet chaste style. There are four great gateways; one in the middle of each side, and facing the four cardinal points; those facing east and west being much finer than the others. Within the inclosure made by this peristyle, and equidistant from the side walls, but much nearer the eastern than the western end, is a mag-\n\n* Vigne states that these stones are cemented \"with an excellent mortar.\" Jacqueumont, on the contrary,\u2014\"Il est construit dans toute son \u00e9tendue de tranches pos\u00e9es successivement les unes au-dessus des autres sans ciment.\" The general character of architecture of this description renders the statement of Jacqueumont more probable, but \"non nostrum tantas componere lites.\"\n\n\u2020 These dimensions are taken from the plan given by Jacqueumont, Pl. 66.\nnificent temple, of a rectangular outline, seventy feet long, sixty feet wide, and in its present ruined state about forty feet high. The great thickness of the walls diminishes the interior space. The whole character of the building, like that of the inclosing colonnade, is massive, simple, and severe, yet in excellent taste. Some notion of the style of architecture may be formed by imagining a combination of the Egyptian, Tuscan, and Saxon. The temple is at present roofless; H\u00fcgel supposes it to have been always so, and to have been left in an unfinished state. He considers its plan to have been in some degree akin to that of the cave temples at Ellora and other places. The ground within and without is strewed with great quantities of vast blocks of stone, which may have been displaced either by the violence of earthquakes, which are frequent here, or by that of hostile superstition; but the former may be regarded as the more probable. There are a few mutilated and time-worn images and sculptures in bas-relief, but nothing to determine with any approach to certainty by whom the building was raised, or what was the period and purport of its erection. The tradition of the Kashmirian Pundits assigns it an antiquity of about two thousand five hundred years. With them it bears the name Korau Pandau, and is attributed to Kaura and Pandu, two kings who figure in the remote legends of Hindoo mythology. It is also known by the name of the temple of Martund, or the Sun and Srina-gur, or the City of the Sun. Vigne thinks that a resemblance may be traced between this structure and the first temple of Jerusalem as described in scripture. H\u00fcgel supposes that it was dedicated to the worship of the linga, and assigns the date of its erection to the period intervening between the waning of Buddhism and the establishment of Brahminism. In common with others who have visited these ruins, he regrets the weakness of language to express the feelings to which they give rise. \"My description unfortunately gives little conception of the impression produced by this simple majestic structure, which I class amongst the finest ruins of the world. The forms are throughout noble, and the embellishments often tasteful; but it is peculiarly characterized by the huge masses of which it is constructed, and the effect of these is heightened by the dark hue of the marble, and\n\n* \u0645\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0646\u062f. \u2020 \u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0647 sun, and \u0646\u0643\u0631 city.\nthe desolation in which it stands in the most fruitful valley in the world.\" These ruins are situate in lat. $33^\\circ 45'$, long. $75^\\circ 8'$.\n\nMATCHIE, in Afghanistan, a village situate on the right bank of the Indus, thirty miles north of Mittunkote.

It is surrounded by a mud wall, and has a citadel, built of burnt brick; but its principal defence is considered to be its position amidst arid sandhills, which afford no water to invaders. Runjeet Sing, when he invested it, at the close of 1821, supplied his troops at first with water carried for a considerable distance by beasts of burthen, and then without delay proceeded to dig an adequate number of wells. The siege was pressed with so much vigour and success, that the Nawab, Hafiz Ahmed, surrendered to the Sikh ruler, on condition of being indemnified by a jaghire in the Derajat.

The Belooche force actually on the ground amounted to twenty-two thousand men, with fifteen pieces of artillery.

Lat. 28\u00b0 36', long. 67\u00b0 56'.\nMEERPOOR, in Sinde, a flourishing town near the left, or eastern bank of the Pinyaree, a great branch of the Indus, and on the route from Cutch to Hyderabad. The surrounding country, which is fertile, well cultivated, and productive, yielded annually a revenue equal to \u00a350,000 to the Ameer of Meerpoor, the least important and wealthy of the Ameers of Sinde. This town is of importance as commanding the line of communication between Cutch and Sinde. Population 10,000. Lat. 24\u00b0 45', long. 68\u00b0 20'.\n\nMEERPOOR, in Sinde, a village ten miles east of Garrah or Gharry-kote. Close to it is Moujdurria, a ruined city, exhibiting abundant evidence of former population and wealth. Lat. 24\u00b0 40', long. 67\u00b0 49'.\n\nMEERPOOR, in Sinde, a village of the Delta, is situate near the right bank of the channel of the Buggaur, formerly the great western outlet of the Indus. Lat. 24\u00b0 30', long. 67\u00b0 36'.\n\nMEERPOOR, in Sinde, a village on the route from Hyderabad to Omercote, and fifty-two miles west of the latter place. Lat. 25\u00b0 24', long. 69\u00b0.\n\nMEETEE, in Beloochistan, a village of Cutch Gundava, situate on the route from Kotree to Dadur, and sixty miles south of the latter town. Lat. 28\u00b0 39', long. 67\u00b0 30'.\n\nMEETLA, in Sinde, a village situate on the left bank of the Western Narra river, on the route from Larkhana to Sehwan, ten miles south of the former town. Lat. 27\u00b0 23', long. 68\u00b0 11'.\n\nMEHR, in Sinde, a village on the left or eastern bank of the Indus, opposite to the decayed town of Lukkec. Lat. 26\u00b0 14', long. 68\u00b0 3'.\n\nMEHY BONDEE, in Beloochistan, a halting-place in the province of Lus, is situate on a torrent falling into the river Hubb. Lat. 25\u00b0 23', long. 67\u00b0.\n\nMEIGHRA, in Bhawlpoor, a village situate on the left bank of the Ghara river, twenty-five miles north-east of the town of Khyrpoor. Lat. 29\u00b0 46', long. 72\u00b0 28'.\n\nMEIMUNA, in Afghanistan, a town with a district of the same name at the western extremity of Hindoo Koosh, in the Huzareh country. The country, though elevated and mountainous, is tolerably fertile and well cultivated. The chief, who has an income of about Rs. 150,000, generally professes allegiance\neither to the rulers of Kabool or those of Herat. Conolly, probably the only European who had visited it, does not give its exact locality, but calculating from the statement of his marches, it is probably in lat. $35^\\circ 50'$, long. $64^\\circ 35'$.\n\nMEKRAN,\\(^1\\) in Beloochistan, the most extensive and westerly province of that country. It is bounded on the north by Afghanistan and the province of Sarawan, on the east by the provinces of Jhalawan and of Lus, on the south by the Arabian Sea, and on the west by Persia. It extends about five hundred miles in length from east to west, two hundred in breadth from north to south, is situate between lat. $25^\\circ 28'$, long. $58^\\circ 66'$, and has a superficial extent of about one hundred thousand square miles.\n\nAll the knowledge concerning this wild and barbarous country possessed by Europeans is derived from Pottinger and his companion, Christie, and from Grant, who preceded the former two in the career of discovery, having passed through the country the year before their visit. The north-western part is traversed by considerable mountain ranges, which rise to the north into the elevated tract known by the name of Kohistan or Highlands. The mountains of the Kohistan extend easterly until they join an offset of the Hala range, so that the general character of the whole of the north of this country is that of a hilly, uneven, and rather elevated district. The two more remarkable ranges of northern Mekram extend east and west, and in some degree parallel to each other, the Wushutee range (the more northern) being the greater. Between them lies the district of Punjgoor, of very inferior elevation. The long, narrow tract extending along the sea-shore is low and level, except at the eastern extremity, where a range of hills, styled by Hart\\(^2\\) the Hara, separates this province from Lus. During rainy weather, numerous torrents flowing from north to south discharge themselves into the sea. Pottinger,\\(^3\\) describing them, says\u2014\u201cThey all usually have a broad and deep channel from the coast, until they reach the mountains or stony hills, where they become contracted into narrow and intricate watercourses, that are quite dry the greater part of the fair season, and in the wet one swelled to terrific torrents, which run off in the course of a few hours after the rain that has filled them ceases.\u201d The beds of those\n\n\\(^1\\) Pott.

Soc. 1840, p. 151; Hart, Acc. of a Jour. from Kur-rachee to Hinglaj.\n\n\\(^3\\) 301.\ntorrents are filled with dense jungle, harbouring numerous wild animals.\n\nThere are two wet seasons, the one in February and March, the other in June, July, and August. In the early wet season, the prevailing wind is from the north-west, and the rains continue three or four weeks. The latter wet season, according to Pottinger,\\(^4\\) \"comprises all the fury of the south-west monsoon.\" The hot season, which begins in March, lasts till October, and the heat is so great during the *khoormu puz*, or \"date ripening,\" in the beginning of August, that none can venture out. Along the sea-coast there is scarcely any winter. In the high lands the weather is cool during November, December, January, and February. The winds during the hot weather destroy every sign of vegetation, and scorch the skin in the most painful manner. The population, as might be expected, are in a great measure pastoral, deriving subsistence from their sheep, goats, and camels; kine seem not to thrive, the country being too rugged and barren. A little grain is cultivated in a few fertile and watered valleys, and in the hottest parts the date-palm thrives remarkably, yielding an important article of food.\\(^5\\) In some places grapes are produced, of good quality. There is scarcely any trade. The scanty exports consist of wool, felt, hides, butter, dates; the imports of raw cotton, coarse cotton cloths, iron, and sugar. Fish is caught in considerable quantities, and forms the principal support of the inhabitants along the sea-coast, who thus retain the habits of their ancestors, the *Ichthyophagi*, mentioned by the historians of Alexander.\n\nThe most powerful tribe of Mekran is the Narroi Belooches, who, in their predatory excursions, mounted on fleet camels, have been known to traverse, in three days, two hundred miles of country, with the design of enslaving the inhabitants and driving off their cattle. Part of the north-west territory is held by Kurd tribes, who have established themselves there as offsets from that branch of their nation settled in Laristan. The inhabitants of the sea-coast have a large admixture of African blood, in consequence of their intercourse with the countries lying to the south-west; and hence they are of larger and more robust form and blacker hue than the other Mekranis, who are described by Pottinger\\(^6\\) as \"a puny, delicate race of men.\" All classes\nof the population are much addicted to intoxication, produced by the use of a fermented beverage obtained from dates. The women are represented as very ugly; they are also very dissolute in their habits, and both sexes impair their constitutions and abridge their lives by excesses. The arms generally in use are the matchlock, sword, shield, and knife. The number of men bearing arms is computed by Grant at 25,000, and if they be assumed to be in the proportion of one to eight to the entire population, an estimate thus obtained will make the total number of inhabitants 200,000, being at the rate of two to the square mile.\n\nMekran is divided into a great number of petty districts, the fluctuating extent and limits of which depend altogether on the comparative power of the respective tribes to maintain their possessions. Those in the south-west are partially subject to the Imam of Muscat; those in the north-west, to Persia. The rest of Mekran had been under the influence of the Khans of Kelat for above two hundred years previously to the accession of Nusseer Khan, who, about the middle of the eighteenth century, in consequence of a treaty with Ahmed Shah Durani, obtained undisputed possession of it. The Khans of Kelat have made scarcely an effort to maintain their claim to sovereignty, and the country is in a state of independence\u2014consequently in a state of confusion, which is thus described by Pottinger:\n\n\"All is now anarchy and bloodshed; each district has its own system of revenge, and travellers or merchants can only move from one part of the country to another when accompanied by an armed party sufficiently strong to repel attack.\"\n\nMekran is important in a military point of view, as containing two routes practicable for the march of an army from Persia to India. The more northern lies among the mountains, at the distance of about a hundred miles from the coast. It is well supplied with water, and abundance of dates and cattle may be obtained, but the road is in many places impassable for artillery. The other road lies along the sea-coast, by Jask and Chobar, to Kurrahee, over the level country between the sea and the mountains. Grant says, \"In the part of it that I travelled I experienced no want of water, except in a small tract of forty miles, between Shirahan and Serik, where the water is soon dried up in the wells; but this is of less consequence, as they are numerous...\"\nLittle or no rain had fallen this year, and yet the nullas always afforded a large supply of water.\" This road is passable both for cavalry and artillery, sufficient forage may be obtained for horses, and, as on the more northern road, dates and cattle are procurable, but no other supplies; so that it would be requisite to have dep\u00f4ts of provisions at suitable intervals. It is, perhaps, scarcely necessary to observe, that this was the route taken by Alexander in his return from India.\n\nMELEMANDA, in Afghanistan, a halting-place on the route from Shawl to Kandahar, and forty miles south-west of the latter city. Here are several villages situate on a small stream, a feeder of the Dorce, and containing many wells. The country to the east is very rocky and uneven, that to the west rather level and well cultivated. Lat. 31\u00b0 16', long. 65\u00b0 58'.\n\nMENEELKA, in Sinde, a village situate on the western route from Larkhana to Sehwan, and forty miles north of the last-mentioned place. Lat. 26\u00b0 52', long. 67\u00b0 51'.\n\nMENOTE, in Beloochistan, a village of Cutch Gundava, on the route from Sukkur to Shahpoor, and eighteen miles south of the latter town. Lat. 28\u00b0 30', long. 68\u00b0 30'.\n\nMER and SER,\u00b9 in the north of the Punjab, two mountain summits, which rise to great height and with sublime effect, fifty or sixty miles east of the eastern boundary of Kashmir. In their regular conical form they as closely resemble each other as though they had been cast in the same mould, but they differ in hue, one being completely white, the other as uniformly black. They seem to be situate close together, and if this be the case, they must be nearly of the same height. No explanation appears to have been given of the singular fact that, being of the same height and situate in the same latitude, one is covered with perpetual snow, the other quite bare. H\u00fcgel considers them identical with the Kantal mountain of the early maps of Kashmir;\u00b2 but Vigne\u00b2 is of opinion that the Kantal is the lofty mountain south of the Bultul Pass. They are probably, with the exception of the mountains in Rupshu, the highest summits between the Sutlej and the Indus. H\u00fcgel clearly viewed them at Vizirabad, in the plain of the Punjab, overtopping the Panjals of Kashmir, and many other intervening mountains, though the distance is not less than a hundred and forty miles. Mer and Ser may be considered situate about lat. 34\u00b0, long. 76\u00b0.\n\n\u00b9 F.

There are five good wells, but scarcely any supplies can be procured, in consequence of the barren nature of the adjacent country, exhibiting only stunted jungle and naked sand-hills. The road is deep and very heavy in both directions from the fort.

Burnes found the Indus here, at the latter end of May, before the swell attained its height, 2,000 yards wide. Later in the season, the adjacent country, to a great extent, is overflowed, and becomes one uninterrupted expanse of water, as the land is, for a considerable distance on each side of the river, on a low level. At this time of year the climate is unhealthy. Mittun Kote is admirably situated for commanding the trade of the Indus throughout its whole extent; and hence, has by some been recommended as the best site of an annual fair, where the traders of Afghanistan and of Central Asia might be supplied with Indian and British goods, but its insalubrity is a great objection to such a selection. It is surrounded with flourishing date groves, from which the Sikhs, who now possess it, derive a good revenue. Elevation above the sea, 220 feet.\u00b2 Population 4,000. It is four hundred and sixty miles from the sea, in lat. $28^\\circ 54'$, long. $70^\\circ 25'$.\n\n\u00b9 Burnes' Bokh. iii. 89; Id. Trade of the Derajat, 110; Id. Pers. Narr. 72; Lord, Med.

It is situate in the desert extending through the eastern part of the state of Bhawlpoo, which has generally a soil of hard tenacious earth, covered in most places with grassy jungle and stunted shrubs, but in some overspread with hills of loose shifting sand. The site of Mojgurh is of firm ground, with low sandy eminences on every side, but at such a distance that light guns cannot command it. The walls are built of brick; they are\nabout fifty feet high (including the parapet, of about seven feet), and two and a half feet thick, with a terreplein four feet broad. On the north side they are in many places perforated with cannon-balls discharged during the siege carried on by the first Khan of Bhawlpoo. The place is half a furlong square, with numerous bastions, and an outwork on the east side to cover the entrance. A mosque conspicuously surmounts the gateway, and a little to the north is a Mahometan tomb, with a cupola profusely ornamented with coloured glazed tiles. There is a large tank outside the walls, and within are several wells containing abundance of good water at the depth of fifty-eight cubits. Mojgurh is in lat. 29\u00b0 1', long. 72\u00b0 11'.\n\nMOKULMUSSEED, in the Punjab, a village situate fifteen miles south-east of the city of Mooltan.

It is a poor place, with a weak and rudely built fort. Vigne\u00b2 mentions it by the name of Mansa. Lat. 34\u00b0 14', long. 73\u00b0 11'.\n\nMONZE CAPE, or RAS MOOAREE, a sharply projecting headland, forming the western extremity of the coast of Sinde, is the termination seawards of the high lands known in different parts by the names of the Hala, Brahooic, and Pubb mountains. Pottinger\u00b9 states that \"it springs abruptly to a conspicuous height and grandeur out of the sea,\" but Horsburgh\u00b2 describes it as of moderate height, and in this he is borne out by the outline given in Dalrymple's charts of the coast of Sinde. On the north-west of it is the island of Chilney, or Churna, the channel of separation being four miles wide, and six or seven fathoms deep in the middle.

The Moola or Gundava Pass winds along its course.\n\nMOOLA or GUNDAVA PASS, in Beloochistan, generally follows the course of the Moola river, and conducts, by a circuitous route, from the elevated region of Kelat to the plain of Cutch Gundava. It commences near the source of the Moola, close to Angeera, in lat. 28\u00b0 10', long. 66\u00b0 12', and at an elevation of 5,250 feet; for about fifty miles it proceeds in a direction generally south-easterly, along the bottom of the valley, or rather through a succession of deep and in general rocky gorges, down which the stream flows, thus cross-cutting the eastern brow of the Hala mountains. At Nurd, in lat. 27\u00b0 52', long. 66\u00b0 57', and having an elevation of 2,850 feet, the valley, and the stream flowing through it, takes an abrupt turn to the north-east, and continues to hold that direction, for about fifty miles, to its termination near Kotree, in Cutch Gundava, at an elevation of 600 feet above the sea, and in lat. 28\u00b0 24', long. 67\u00b0 27'. As the route generally follows the course of the stream to within a short distance of the north-eastern or lower extremity of the pass, there is always abundance of good water. The descent being four thousand six hundred and fifty feet in about a hundred miles, the average fall is forty-six feet in a mile. At Paesht Khana, about forty miles below the upper extremity of the pass, the river Moola receives a considerable stream, flowing from the north. Through the valley along which this stream flows, a route proceeds direct from Kelat to this part of the Moola Pass, but is not practicable for artillery or carriages. This direct route is called the Panduran Pass, from a village of that name situate on it. In the close of 1839, the Anglo-Indian detachment under the command of General Willshire, after storming Kelat, marched to Sinde through the Moola Pass, and a brief notice of the marches and halting-places on the route will, perhaps, best shew its character. To Bapow, a\ndistance of twelve miles, the descent was considerable, amounting to 1,250 feet, the difference between its elevation and that of Angeera. The river in some places disappeared, sinking, probably, in its gravelly bed: where it came to light, the depth nowhere exceeded a few inches. On every side very steep and high mountains were visible. The next march was of twelve miles, to Peesee Bhent, elevation 4,600 feet, the bed of the river still in many places dry, and in general constituting the road. In one place precipices, 500 feet high, were so close to each other, that the passage between them was not more than thirty or forty feet wide. An enemy might here effectually prevent the progress of troops by merely rolling down a few blocks of stone, and there are no means of turning the defile. The march to Putkee, distant twelve miles, and of the elevation of 4,250 feet, lay through a wide part of the valley, displaying considerable cultivation; the road in some instances diverged from the channel of the river, but crossed it several times. To Paesht Khana, a distance of ten miles and a half, and at an elevation of 3,500 feet, the road was at first very difficult, lying over the stony bed of the river; it afterwards became better, crossing a considerable plain, in which the direct road from Kelat by Panduran, lying to the north, joined the Moola Pass. The next march was twelve miles, to Nurd, elevation 2,850 feet, and the most southern point of the pass. The road several times crossed the river, which receives from the south a stream, along the course of which a cross road proceeds to Khozdar. On the right of the road the two peaks, Dodandan (two teeth), towered to a great height. In the succeeding march, to Jungi Kooshta, distant twelve miles, and of the elevation of 2,150 feet, the character of the valley and inclosing hills improved, as they afforded good pasture. For the next march, to Bent-i-jah, distant ten miles and a half, and of the elevation of 1,850 feet, the road scarcely deviated from the course of the river, and was in general good. In the following march to Kohow, distant above eleven miles, and of the elevation of 1,250 feet, the road had a slight ascent and descent. The next march brought the detachment to Kullar, distance ten miles, elevation 750 feet. This is probably the termination of the pass, though the route proceeds thirteen miles farther, to Kotree, in the plain of Cutch Gundava. In a military point of view, it is preferable to the Bolan Pass,\nas the road is better, the ascent easier and more regular, water abundant, and some supplies obtainable. The guns brought through the pass by the British were light field-pieces of the horse artillery. Masson,\\(^2\\) who appears to have carefully explored the pass, gives its character in the following words:\u2014\u201cIn a military point of view, the route, presenting a succession of open spaces connected by narrow passages or defiles, is very defensible, at the same time affording convenient spots for encampment, abundance of excellent water, fuel, and more or less of forage. It is level throughout the road, either tracing the bed of the stream or leading near to its left bank.\u201d\n\nMOOLA GOORI, in Afghanistan, a village situated on the right bank of the Lundyee river, twenty miles south of its confluence with the river Surat.

It is situated three miles east of the Chenab, the inundations of which reach it. Elphinstone,\\(^3\\) who saw this city in 1809, before it had been stormed by the Sikhs, describes it as \u201csurrounded with a fine wall between forty and fifty feet high.\u201d This is now dilapidated, but the citadel continues a place of strength, being more regular in construction than pro-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Leech, Rep. on Commerce of Mooltan, 79.\n\n\\(^2\\) Masson, Bal., Afg.

It is surmounted by thirty towers and protected by a ditch, faced with masonry.* The only buildings within it of any importance, are the battered palace of the former Khan, and a lofty Mahometan shrine. It was stormed in 1818 by Runjeet Sing,\\(^6\\) who cut to pieces the Afghan garrison of three thousand, with the exception of five hundred admitted to quarter. The booty on that occasion is said to have amounted to four millions sterling.\\(^\u2020\\) The army of the besiegers consisted of 25,000, of whom 1,900 were slain.\n\nMooltan is the largest town in the Sikh territory after Lahore and Amritsar. The present town is built on a mound of considerable height, formed of the ruins of more ancient cities. The bazaars are extensive, and are well supplied with all articles of traffic and consumption, and the shops amount altogether in number to four thousand six hundred.\\(^7\\) Its principal manufactures are silks, cottons, shawls, loongees, brocades, tissues. Its merchants are considered rich, and about fifteen of them are computed collectively to possess a million and a half of rupees. Banking constitutes a large proportion of the business of Mooltan, in which it has in some measure supplanted Shikarpoor; and the prosperity of the town is in all respects considered on the increase. It yields a revenue of 575,000 rupees.\n\nThe vicinity is covered with an amazing quantity of ruins of tombs, mosques, and shrines, which shew the former extent and antiquity of the city. North\\(^8\\) of the place is the magnificent shrine of Sham Tabrezi, who, according to tradition, was flayed alive here.\n\n* Such is Masson's account (i. 396). Burnes (Bokhara, iii. 112) says, \"The fortress of Mooltan has no ditch; the nature of the country will not admit of one.\"\n\n\u2020 Prinsep states, that Runjeet Sing compelled his troops to disgorge their booty, which he appropriated to his own treasury. This, however, is at variance with the account given by the Maharajah himself to Moorcroft; but his highness might not, perhaps, regard a slight sacrifice of truth to the honour of his liberality.\nas a martyr, and at whose prayer the sun descended from the heavens, and produced the intense heat from which Mooltan suffers, and for which it is proverbial.

Mooltan is said by Burnes\\(^9\\) to be to this day styled\\(^9\\) iii. 114. \"Mallithan,\" which he translates the place of the Malli, and thence infers it to have been that capital of the Malli taken by Alexander. But Arrian\\(^1\\) mentions several such cities, and his brevity and the slender acquaintance which he had of the localities, must render any decision on such points at the present day hazardous and uncertain. Mooltan was taken by the Mahometans, under Mahomed Ben Kasim, at the close of the eighth century; by Mahmood of Ghiznee at the commencement of the eleventh; by Tamerlane at the close of the fourteenth.\\(^2\\) Price, Mahomedan Hist. iii.\n\nSince its capture by Runjeet Sing, it has been garrisoned by Sikhs, who, though only amounting to five or six hundred, keep in severe subjection the Mahometans, supposed to amount to forty thousand persons.\\(^3\\) The number of the entire population is estimated to be about 80,000.\\(^4\\) Lat. \\(30^\\circ 8'\\), long. \\(71^\\circ 28'\\).\n\nMOONDEESHEHUR, in Afghanistan, a village on the left bank of the Turnak, and on the northern route from Kandahar to Shawl, being twelve miles south-east of the former town.

The capital, which is also called Mundi, is situate at the confluence of the Sukyt river with the Beas, which is here two hundred yards wide, very deep, and crossed by a ferry. These rivers have, every twenty-four hours, a periodical rise and fall, in consequence of the melting of snow by the heat of the sun, so that they rise towards evening and continue to do so throughout the greater part of the night, decreasing towards morning and throughout the forenoon.

When the Rajah dies, between twenty and thirty women invariably perish in this dreadful manner, and the number who suffer among the humbler classes is proportionate to the rank of the departed. In the vicinity, are productive mines of iron and salt, and the greater part of the revenue of the prince is derived from these sources.

It has on the west the lofty Suliman range, and on the north the snow-clad peaks of Sufaid Koh. Though exposed to the incursions of the marauders of the neighbouring mountains, it is so productive of grain and other necessaries of life, that it is thickly peopled. Society is here in a singularly primitive state, as the people have no general government, each village being under its own independent chief, and acknowledging no other authority. The valley is sometimes visited by an expedition of the Sikhs from the Derajat, who levy an enforced tribute from the inhabitants. Murwut, the chief place, is little more than a village.

It contains about four hundred houses, surrounded with a crenated mud wall. The neighbouring country is probably the richest part of Beloochistan, having in summer a mild and salubrious climate and producing the finest fruits in abundance, besides grain, madder, and tobacco. Winter, however, brings considerable cold, and on this account the wealthier inhabitants, at the approach of that season, emigrate to the warm district of Cutch Gundava. The present town has replaced a more ancient one, the citadel of which was destroyed by Ahmed Shah; the ruins are observable on a mound close to the wall. The height above the sea cannot be less than 5,700 feet, as there is a slight ascent in travelling to this place from Shawl,\u00b2 which has an elevation of 5,563 feet.

Some have supposed it\nto be the Aornus of the historians of Alexander, the capture of which was one of the most arduous exploits of that conqueror. Lat. $34^\\circ 49'$, long. $71^\\circ 15'$.\n\nNABOG NYH, or NABOG NYE, a pass over the mountain-range, bounding Kashmir on the east and dividing it from the valley of Muru Wurdwun. It is formed of gneiss and mica slate, and thus differs in structure from most of the mountains bounding Kashmir, which consist principally of basalt, trap, or other description of rock, generally regarded as of volcanic origin. The height of the pass is 12,000 feet. Lat. $33^\\circ 43'$, long. $75^\\circ 20'$.\n\nNADALI, in Afghanistan, a village about twenty miles southwest of the town of Girishk, in lat. $31^\\circ 37'$, long. $64^\\circ 3'$.\n\nNADAUN,\\(^1\\) in the north of the Punjab, a small town on the left or south bank of the Beas, here a deep, rapid, and clear stream, a hundred and fifty yards wide, and running at the rate of three miles and a half an hour. The right bank is of sandstone, lofty and abrupt; the left of mould, lower and shelving. Here is a ferry much frequented, being on the route from British India to Kashmir. Nadaun was formerly a flourishing place, and was held by an independent raja, but the prince was expelled by Runjeet Singh, and since that event the town has fallen into decay. Near Nadaun is Jewala Muki, a celebrated Hindoo temple, surmounted with a richly gilded roof, and inclosing a fissure in the rock, from which issue jets of inflammable gas, which, when lighted, are considered the breath of the tutelary deity.\u2014(See Jewala Muki.) The assessment of the land revenue here payable to the Sikh government is regulated by a curious contrivance, which, according to Moorcroft,\\(^2\\) \"without diminishing the amount, was likely to be satisfactory to the peasantry.\u2014This was by a rough analysis of the soil. A given quantity of the earth was put into a fine muslin sieve and washed with water until all the mould was carried through and nothing but the sand left, and according to its proportion to the whole, a deduction was made from the assessment.\" The rate for rich soil was about five shillings an acre.\n\nThe site of Nadaun is delightful, and during its prosperity it was celebrated for fine gardens and various other attractions. Vigne\\(^3\\) mentions a popular proverb\u2014\"Who will come to Nadaun, and then leave it?\" It is in lat. $31^\\circ 46'$, long. $76^\\circ 18'$.\nNADIR DEH, in Afghanistan, a village situate about four miles to the right of the road from Ghuznee to Shawl, in lat. $31^\\circ 40'$, long. $67^\\circ 20'$.\n\nNAEEWALLA, in the Punjab, a town on the route from Ramnegurh to Labore, and fifty-five miles north-west of the latter place.

Lat. $32^\\circ 17'$, long. $73^\\circ 41'$.\n\nNAGAR, or NAGYR, north of the Punjab, a small town or village, the principal place of a petty state also called Nagar. This is situate north-west of Bultistan, and south of Pamir. It consists chiefly of a valley of about three days' journey in length, and six or eight miles broad, and is intersected and drained by a stream, which falls into the Gilgit river. Fuel is scarce, and this deficiency is felt severely, as much snow falls in winter; the summers, however, are sufficiently warm to mature grapes, melons, and crops of wheat and barley. Gold dust is obtained by searching the sands of the river. The inhabitants are known among the neighbouring tribes by the name of Dungars, and are governed by an independent raja. The female sex in this region are remarkable for their attractions. Vigne, who takes a great interest in such topics, adduces the following singular testimony to their charms:\u2014\"The women are famous for their beauty, and Nazim Khan used to assure me, that their complexions were so fair, delicate, and transparent, that when they drank, the water was perceivable in their throats.\" The chief place, Nagar, stands on the banks of the river, and is defended by a fort. The name is generic, and signifies town,* but, by no unusual appropriation of such terms, it is used in this instance to designate a particular place. Nagar lies in lat. $35^\\circ 47'$, long. $74^\\circ 22'$.\n\nNAGGAR, in Afghanistan, a considerable walled town in the plain of Bannoo, westward of the Indus, and at the foot of the Salt or Kala Bagh range of mountains. It is a commercial place, and has a good bazaar, but the walls have been allowed to fall into great decay. The surrounding country is fertile and well cultivated, but suffers much from the incessant intestine wars of the inhabitants, and the inroads of the Vizeree freebooters from\n\n* \u0646\u06af\u0631 town.\nthe neighbouring mountains, to guard against whose attacks, every dwelling is fortified. Lat. $33^\\circ 10'$, long. $71^\\circ 5'$.\n\nNAGROLAH, in the north-east of the Punjab, a village on the route from Chumba to Kashmir, by the Banihal Pass.

Lat. $33^\\circ 12'$, long. $68^\\circ 21'$.\n\nNANDAN SAR, in Kashmir, a small lake situate, with four others, on the northern side of the Pir Panjal mountain, and a little north of the pass of the same name, which also is sometimes called the Nandan Sar pass. The collective waters of these form the source of the Dumdum or Huripur river. According to Hugel, the Perhamgalla river flows from Nandan Sar to the south-west, and the Dumdum to the north-east, but this double efflux seems very improbable. Nandan Sar is held in high reverence by the Hindoos, and is visited by them in pilgrimage. Lat. $33^\\circ 31'$, long. $74^\\circ 26'$.\n\nNANEE, in Afghanistan, a small town on the route from Kandahar to Ghuznee, and ten miles south of the latter place.

It is of considerable size, with houses built of burned brick. Its situation is in a level alluvial country, about a mile from the right bank of the Indus. Lat. 27\u00b0 7', long. 68\u00b0 2'.\n\nNARI, a river of Beloochistan, has its origin on the eastern slope of the Hala mountains, about lat. 30\u00b0, long. 68\u00b0, and holding a course, generally in a southerly direction, for about fifty miles, it is joined near the village Eree, in lat. 29\u00b0 26', long. 67\u00b0 58', by the river Kauhee or Bolan. The united stream continues to flow southwards, and is finally lost in the arid plain of Cutch Gundava. When heavy rains fall it has a great body of water, and it is said that, when remarkably swollen, it sometimes even reaches the Indus. For many months in the year the stream disappears, and water can then be obtained only by digging in the bed, or from reservoirs made by excavation or draining. It is, however, of the utmost importance, being, in this sultry country, the only source from which water can be obtained for domestic purposes, or for irrigation.\n\nNARRA\u00b9 (Eastern), in Sinde, a large branch of the Indus, separating from the main stream on the eastern side, a few miles above Rorce. Taking a southerly course, it passes by the ruins of Alore, where it is crossed by a bridge, and thence continues to flow in the same direction until its water, in the dry season, is absorbed or evaporated in the desert of Eastern Sinde. In the lower part of its course, about lat. 25\u00b0 50', long. 69\u00b0 10', it throws off during inundation a branch to the south-westward, bearing the name of Phuraun or Purani Deria, \"the ancient river,\" and then turning to the south-east, flows by the fort of Omercote. Lower down it joins the united stream of the Purana and the Goonie or Fulailie, and falls into the sea by the Koree mouth, after a course of nearly four hundred miles. During the low\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms. Doc. Burnes' Bokh. (ii. 77, 267; Macnair on the Indus, in Jour. Roy. As. Soc. 1834, p. 41.\nseason of the Indus it ceases to be a stream, but when the inundation is at its height, it generally carries a very large body of water. In 1826 it overspread the desert to a great extent; swept away part of the fortress of Omercote, though ninety miles from the main channel of the Indus, and forced its way to the sea by the riunn of Cutch, working for itself a passage through the Ullahbund, a mound thrown up across its channel by the great earthquake of 1819.\n\nNARRA (Western), in Sinde, a great and important branch of the Indus. It separates from the western side of the river about twenty-five miles below Sukkur, in lat. $27^\\circ 40'$, long. $68^\\circ 34'$, and takes a southerly course, in a direction in a great measure parallel to the main stream. At its extremity, in lat. $26^\\circ 30'$, long. $67^\\circ 45'$, it expands into lake Manchar. From the southeastern part of this lake, the Arul, a navigable stream, flows, and discharges its water into the Indus. The direct distance from the place where the Narra divaricates from the Indus, to the expansion into lake Manchar, is about one hundred miles; * but measured along its very tortuous course, it will be found to be fully double that distance. The long, narrow island, insulated by the Indus, the Narra, lake Manchar, and the Arul, is one of the most fertile tracts in the world, very highly cultivated, and densely peopled. During the season of inundation, the Western Narra is preferred to the main channel of the Indus for the purposes of navigation, in consequence of the current being less violent. The word Narra signifies a snake in the vernacular language, and the name has, without doubt, been bestowed in consequence of the convolutions of the stream.\n\nNASSERABAD, in Beloochistan, a village on the route from Kedje to Gwetter, and twenty-five miles south-west of the former place. It is situate on the river Dustee, here called the Moole-dance.

It is built of brick, faced at the gateways with stone, and was originally of such strength as to serve for a fortress as well as a caravanserai, but it is now in a ruinous state. It is situate on the river Tauhi\u00b9 or Tihoi,\u00b2 which, at eight or ten miles to the south-east, falls into the Chinab. An inscription on one of the gateways records that it was built by the Mogul emperor, Akbar.

The overhanging mountains are covered with pines and hollies. The inhabitants are Tajiks, generally supposed\nto be of Persian descent, with a few of a peculiar race called Pashai, who are said to speak a dialect similar to that of the natives of Kafiristan, and in some other respects to resemble that ancient and remarkable people. Though adjacent to the usual seat of the Afghan government, the inhabitants of Nijrow have, through their bravery, and the difficulty of their country, preserved their independence.

As. Soc. Beng. 1841, p. 617.\n\n* Burnes ascribes to Rennell a statement that Timur crossed the Indus not Pers. Narr. ii. at Attock, but at Dingote, about seventy miles lower down. But he does not refer to the page, and the opinion of Rennell, as above quoted, is distinctly given in page 85:\u2014\"The Indus he (Timur) crossed, I take it for granted, at or very near the place where Attock now stands.\"\nthe Nobra Tsuh lake, or glacier, embosomed in the mountain, joins the Indus a few miles above and east of Iskardo. The lowest part of this tract is estimated by Vigne to be more than 11,000 feet above the sea, but though so elevated and very mountainous, it is described by him not only as picturesque, but as having a considerable degree both of culture and population. The fort and village of Nobra on the Shy-Yok is the principal place, and is in lat. $34^\\circ 38'$, long. $77^\\circ 10'$.\n\nNOGRAMA, in Beloochistan, a village forty miles south of the town of Kelat, in lat. $28^\\circ 28'$, long. $66^\\circ 39'$.\n\nNOHGIRA, in Northern Afghanistan, a village situate in the valley of Boonere, and fifteen miles from the right bank of the Indus.

The name Nungnehar vernacularly signifies nine rivers, and has been given with reference to the numerous streams which flow across this district from the Sufeid Koh to the Kabool river. The most direct road from the Khyber Pass to Kabool lies through it, but it is little frequented in consequence of the great number of defiles and the turbulent...\nand predatory character of the people, who take pride in the name of Yagistan, or \"Rebel Land,\" as the rough and inaccessible part of the region is called. The inhabitants, though habitually ferocious and inveterate robbers, are industrious cultivators, so that there is no spot neglected, where the labour of the husbandman can be beneficially employed. Where the plough cannot be used, its place is supplied by the spade, and every declivity, terrace, and earthy nook, is carefully and successfully tilled. Water is abundant, the soil being generally saturated with it, and where there are no rivulets wells are dug, which send forth perennial rills. This sequestered district exhibits a mixture of orchard, field, and garden, and abounds in mulberry, pomegranate, and other fruit-trees. The banks of the streams are fringed with rows of weeping willows, and during the greater part of the year enamelled with wild flowers and fragrant aromatic herbs.

Over it is the Bunderpoor pass, from Kashmir into Tibet. Von Hugel found the boiling water point on it to be at $186.8$, which, according to the approximation usually adopted, would give about $11,000$ feet for the height of the pass. North-west of this, the Nangaparvat attains a much greater elevation, the exact amount of which has not been ascertained.

It contains a good and well-stocked bazaar, and has 6,000 or 8,000 inhabitants,* a large portion of whom are Kashmirians, employed in shawl weaving. There is a fort built of stones and mud on an eminence about two hundred feet high, at the base of which flows a small river, a feeder of the Ravee, which it joins about thirty miles lower down. It is commanded on every side by higher eminences. Nurpur is now held by the Sikh government, which has expelled the hereditary raja.

It is situate on the river Jailum, the navigation of which here again becomes practicable after its interruption between Baramula and this place. Here rafts are made of deodar and other timber, the growth of the neighbouring mountains, and guided, by means of poles and paddles, to the towns lower down on the river. A practicable road runs down each side of the navigable course of the Jailum, as far as the town bearing the same name. Oin is in lat. 33\u00b0 40', long. 73\u00b0 50'.\n\nOLEERA, in Sinde, a small town on the route from Shikarpoor to Khyerpoor, and six miles north of the latter place. It is situate amidst jungle and woods of stunted trees, in a low alluvial country, intersected by canals and watercourses from the Indus. Lat. 27\u00b0 34', long. 68\u00b0 46'.\n\nOLIPORE,1 in Afghanistan, a narrow valley in the north of the district of Lughman, and on the southern border of Kafiristan. Griffith considers that its natural characteristics strongly resemble those of the valleys of the Himalaya, especially in the abundance, large growth, and excellence of its timber trees. The bottom of the valley, which is about three thousand feet above the sea, produces very fine oaks, and thick forests of these extend up the sides of the inclosing mountains to the height of about four thousand five hundred feet above the same level. At\n\n---\n\n1 Jour. As. Soc. Beng. 1841, pp. 797-801, Grif. Rep. on Subjects connected with Afg.\nthat elevation commence the forests of zaitoon, or wild olive, which clothe the mountains for a farther height of two thousand feet. The deodar cedar grows in great abundance above this, to the elevation of ten thousand feet. The timber used at Kabool being of bad quality and high price, it would be very desirable for that place that favourable means should be found for transporting thither the produce of these fine forests. This, however, is impracticable, on account of the intervening difficulties; but the timber of Olipore could certainly be floated to the river of Kabool down the stream which flows through the valley, and is described by Griffith as a large torrent. Once afloat on the Kabool river, there would be no insurmountable obstacle to its passage even as far as the ocean. Olipore is in lat. $34^\\circ 54'$, long. $70^\\circ 12'$.\n\nOMARKOTE.\u2014See OMERCOTE.\n\nOMERCOTE, in Sinde, a town and fort in the eastern desert. The fort is situate half a mile from the town, and is five hundred feet square, having a mud wall forty feet high, a strong round tower at each corner, and six square towers on each side. There is but one gate, which is on the eastern side, and is protected by an outwork. It was usually garrisoned by four hundred men. Though nearly a hundred miles from the Indus, a branch of that river finds its way hither in time of inundation, and, in 1826, flowed with such violence as to sweep away the north-west tower. Water is to be had near the surface, and there is a pool twenty feet deep in the channel of this branch of the Indus west of the fort. Omercote was taken in 1813, by the Ameers of Sinde, from the Rajah of Joudpoor. It is celebrated as the birthplace of the renowned emperor Akbar, his father, Homayan, having in his exile taken refuge here. Lat. $25^\\circ 19'$, long. $69^\\circ 47'$.\n\nOOBOWRAH, in Sinde, a village on the route from Subzulcote to Shikarpoor, and thirteen miles west of the former town. It is situate on the eastern bank of a dund or stagnant piece of water, in a low alluvial country, which is extensively flooded during the inundation of the Indus, but in the season of low water the road east and west of the village is level and practicable for carriages. Lat. $28^\\circ 10'$, long. $69^\\circ 30'$.\n\nOOCH, in Bhalwpoor, a city situate four miles from the left bank of the Punjnad river, amidst beautiful groves. It is formed of three distinct towns, a few hundred yards apart, and each sur-\nrounded by a ruinous brick wall. The streets are narrow and meanly built, but the bazaars are large, and well supplied with wares, and there is considerable general traffic. These towns are built on mounds, formed by the materials of great cities formerly existing here. In the immediate vicinity are prodigious quantities of ruins, still in such preservation that they could be easily rendered habitable. Ooch is regarded with veneration by Mahometans, in consequence of containing five shrines of deceased pirs or saints, saiyids, reputed descendants from Mahomet.\n\nPopulation, 20,000.

It is surrounded by a mud wall, outside of which are several wells, yielding a scanty supply of water. The road in this part of the route is good, lying over a level plain; but at fourteen miles west of the village it is crossed by a canal twenty yards broad and fifteen feet deep, with steep banks. There is some cultivation in the immediate neighbourhood of Oodana. Forage is abundant, but other supplies scarce. Seven miles to the east of the town are the ruins of old Oodana. The present town is in lat. 28\u00b0 30', long. 67\u00b0 49'.\n\nOODAR, in Sinde, a halting-place on the route from Roree to Jessulmair, and fifty miles south-east of the former town. Here are two wells yielding good water, but no habitations nor supplies, except a little coarse grass as forage for camels. The fort which formerly stood here was, some years ago, swept away by a flood, and this event seems to indicate that the waters of the Indus sometimes find their way over this waste, though nearly fifty miles distant from the main channel. A mound with a few trees now marks this former site of the fort. Oodar is in lat. 27\u00b0 25', long. 69\u00b0 30'.\n\nODEENUGGUR, in the Punjab, a ruined city on the left or east bank of the Jailum, supposed by Burnes to be the remains of Nicca, built by Alexander on the field of his victory over Porus.

It is situate on the left bank of an offset of the Indus, in the low fertile tract stretching north and south between the main channel and the desert, and laid under water in the season of inundation. Lat. 30\u00b0 40', long. 71\u00b0.\n\nPAHARPOOR, in Afghanistan, a considerable town of the Derajat, situate where the route branches off westward to Tak, from the route northward through Dera Ismael Khan.

The land in the vicinity is in general employed for pasture, and produces the prangos pabularia, so highly esteemed by Moorcroft for winter fodder. Izzet Ullah, who calls this place Panderras, observes that the road is good in this part of the route. Gholaum Hyder styles the village Paen-dur-rauz. Professor Wilson, the editor of Moorcroft, considers that it should be called Pain-dras, or \"lower dras,\" but this does not seem justifiable, as the place lies higher up the course of the river and is more elevated than Dras. The elevation above the sea exceeds 9,000 feet. Lat. $34^\\circ 20'$, long. $75^\\circ 26'$.  \n\nPAK PATTAN (pure town *), in the Punjab, a town situate five miles west of the river Ravee, and eight miles from Mamoke Ghat, a much-frequented ferry over it. A perfectly level plain of four miles wide extends towards the river from the town, which, viewed at some distance, has the appearance of a citadel situate on the summit of a lofty eminence. It is built on the site of the ancient fort of Ajwadin, Ajodin, or Adjoodhun, and is celebrated as the place close to which Mahmud of Ghuznee, Tamerlane, and several other invaders of Hindostan, crossed the river boundary of the Punjab on the east. The name of this town is considered to indicate its peculiar sanctity, in consequence of its having been for many years the residence of a celebrated Mahometan saint, Shekh Farid-u-Din, of whose miraculous powers many traditions are recounted by the natives. It is related, among his other wonderful deeds, that when hungry, he threw into his mouth handfuls of dust or pebbles, which immediately became sugar; and as he effected similar transmutations in innumerable instances for the benefit of other persons, he obtained the name of Shakarganj,\u2020 or \"sugar store.\" The tomb or shrine is situate in a spot depressed below the rest of the mound on which the town is built, and which has an elevation of about forty feet above the plain. It is an unornamented and inconsiderable building, having\nbut one small apartment, containing the remains of the saint in a grave, covered with faded drapery. There are in it two small doors, one to the north, the other to the east. The last is called the \"door to Paradise,\" and is only opened on the fifth day of the first Mahometan month, called Moharram, and considered peculiarly holy, in reference to the belief that during the ten first days the Koran\\(^3\\) was sent from heaven for revelation to men.\n\nThis doorway is about two feet wide, but so low that it cannot be passed without stooping; and the chamber itself is of such contracted dimensions, that it can contain only about thirty persons. Those who rub their foreheads on the saint's grave are considered safe from perdition; the first who enters the chamber is believed to secure thereby a peculiarly high degree of felicity in a future state, and as the crowd of pilgrims, comprising Hindoos as well as Mussulmans, is immense, the crush is tremendous. The natives, however, assert that no accidents occur, in consequence of the tender care which the saint has for his votaries. Among other relics preserved here is a piece of wood in the shape of a cake, which, it is said, was used by the saint to solace himself when assailed by hunger during his long fasts. Pak Pattan is supposed by Masson\\(^4\\) to have been the site of the colossal altars erected by Alexander to mark the eastern boundary of his conquests.

Here is a\nbridge of several arches over the river. The town is surrounded by luxuriant orchards and gardens; it contains between three and four hundred houses,* a bazaar, and two Mahometan shrines. The neighbouring country is generally cultivated for the growth of saffron, and the produce is considered finer than that of any part of Hindostan. Lat. $34^\\circ 3'$, long. $74^\\circ 46'$.\n\nPANALIA, in Sinde, a village on the route from Omercote to Nuggur Parkur, and twenty-five miles north of the latter place.

Lat. $31^\\circ 56'$, long. $71^\\circ 14'$.\n\nPANDRENTON, in Kashmir, an antique temple of small dimensions, standing in a reservoir or tank about four miles south-east of Srinagur, the present capital of the valley. It is a striking specimen of the simple massive and chaste style which characterizes the architectural antiquities of Kashmir. The ground plan is a square of twenty feet, and the roof pyramidal. In each of the four sides is a doorway ornamented with pilasters right and left, and surmounted by a pediment. The whole is constructed of blocks of regularly hewn limestone. The interior is filled with water communicating with that without, which is about four feet deep; and as the building is completely insulated, it can be reached only by wading or swimming. The purpose of its construction is not known, but it is generally considered a Buddhist relic. It exhibits neither inscriptions nor sculptures, except the figure of a large lotus carved on the roof inside. Lat. $34^\\circ 2'$, long. $74^\\circ 47'$.\n\nPANDURAN, in Beloochistan, a village situate on the direct pass which, proceeding southwards from Kelat, joins the Moola pass at Paeesht Khana. It is built on the banks of a torrent, which commencing a little south-east of Kelat, flows southward, and joins the Moola river. The pass, which scarcely deviates in any place from the course of the stream, is much shorter than the upper part of the Moola pass, with which it is collateral, but is less available for military purposes in consequence of not being practicable for artillery. Panduran is in lat. $28^\\circ 36'$, long. $66^\\circ 45'$.\n\nPANEEWAN, in Beloochistan, a village in the Moola or Gundava pass, on the route from Kelat to Gundava.

Hence its name, which signifies five rivers, that being the number of the principal streams. It has Chitral to the north; to the east are several small independent states, little known, but which extend north of the Indus to Bolor; to the south-east is Suwat; to the south, Afghanistan; to the west, Kafiristan. It has been overrun by the Yusuf Zais Afghans, who, having reduced the primitive inhabitants to a state of vassalage, maintain themselves in a turbulent independence. It is in general a maze of mountains densely wooded, except in the neighbourhood of the rivers, where cultivation is carefully attended to. The limits of Panjkora are ill defined, but the length cannot exceed eighty miles, and the breadth is about thirty. Panjkora, the principal place, is laid down in lat. 35\u00b0 25', long. 72\u00b0.\n\nPANNOH-CA-PAR, in Sinde, a village situate in the eastern desert, and about forty-two miles north-east of Omercote.

The surrounding country is regarded as peculiarly favourable to the constitution of the horse, and on this account the Sikh government has an extensive stud here. Lat. 32\u00b0 25', long. 73\u00b0 36'.\n\nPARKOO, in Beloochistan, a village of the province of Jhalawan, on the route from Kelat to Nal, and twelve miles north-\nwest of the latter place. It is situate on a fine stream of water, amidst a few trees and traces of former cultivation, but is at present little better than a heap of ruins, having been destroyed by Mehrab Khan of Kelat. Lat. 27\u00b0 49', long. 65\u00b0 54'.\n\nPARKUTA, in Bulti, or Little Tibet, a small town with a fort, situate on the Indus, about twenty-five miles south-east of Iskardo, the capital. Before the late conquest of this country by the Sikhs, it was the residence of a raja, the brother of the sovereign of Bulti. It is a place of some trade, having a manufacture of saddles, which are much prized.

It is situate close to a Kariwah, or table-land of fertile soil, once well cultivated, as is evident from the remains of canals constructed for the purpose of irrigation. At present it is a complete waste.\n\nThis seems to have been an important locality during the predominance of Hindooism in Kashmir, as in the vicinity are the remains of two ancient buildings in a style similar to the celebrated temple at Matan.* Patan is still a place of pilgrimage for the superstitious Hindoos.\u00b2 Lat. 34\u00b0 7', long. 74\u00b0 21'.\n\n* Vigne, who took much interest in the architectural relics in Kashmir, Kashmir, ii. 167, gives the following description of the ruins at Patan:\u2014\"After Martund, the\n\n\u00b9 Moorcr.

The fort has a fine appearance, is built substantially of brick, has a ditch and glacis, and being situate on level ground, is not commanded in any direction; it consequently admits of an obstinate defence. A lofty citadel in the interior rises above the ramparts. It was built by Shah Jehan, the Mogul emperor, during his attack on Nurpur.

It is of small dimensions, but in a tasteful and impressive style of architecture. It is thus described by Vigne, probably the only European by whom it has been surveyed. \"The interior and exterior ornaments are particularly elegant. The building is dedicated, I believe, to Vishnu, as Surya or the sun-god, small sitting figures of whom are inserted in niches on the cornice outside. The ceiling of the interior is radiated so as to represent the sun, and at each corner of the square, the space intervening between the angle and the line of the circle is filled up with a gin, or attendant, who seems to be sporting at the edge of his rays.\" Pa Yech is in lat. \\(33^\\circ 50'\\), long. \\(74^\\circ 45'\\).\n\nold ruin at Putun (Patan) is perhaps the best specimen of the square ruined temple to be found in the valley. The walls and colonnade of the peristyle are no longer in existence, and the interior of the remaining building, with its well-carved and graceful figures of Vishnu and Lachmi, are well worth the inspection of the traveller, being scarcely inferior to those at Martund. At a little distance from it are the ruined walls of a smaller and separate building, and both and all are built of the mountain limestone occurring near Putun.\"\nPEEDUR KUSSUR, in Beloochistan, a village situate on the route from Kedje to Bela, and a hundred miles west of the latter town.

Lat. $34^\\circ 17'$, long. $70^\\circ 55'$.\n\nPESHAWER, or PESHAWUR, usually considered part\nof Afghanistan, a very fertile and valuable territory, lying between the Indus above and below Attock and the Khyber mountains, through which is the great Khyber pass. It is bounded on the north by Suwat and the region lying between it and the Indus\u2014on the east, by part of the last-mentioned territory, the Indus, and the territory of the independent Afghans holding the Salt or Kala range\u2014on the south, by the possessions of the same Afghans, and on the west, by the Khyber mountains and the Afghan province of Jelalabad. It lies between lat. $33^\\circ 27'$ and $34^\\circ 22'$, and long. $71^\\circ 29'$ and $72^\\circ 12'$. In the extent here assigned to this territory, it is sixty-five miles long, fifty miles broad, and about one thousand eight hundred square miles in extent. Its climate is very hot in summer, the thermometer frequently reaching $110^\\circ$ or $112^\\circ$ in the shade. The heat, however, is occasionally mitigated by the breezes from the neighbouring mountains, and as the country, naturally fertile, is well watered by the Indus, the Kabool river, the Bara, and some other streams of less importance, and is, moreover, well cultivated, it is amazingly productive. The water is applied to the purposes of cultivation by means of canals and innumerable small channels, from whence it is drawn up by means of a pole having a fulcrum in the middle and a bucket suspended at one end, which is raised by the hand pressing the other end; or where the depth is too great for this mode of operation, the water is obtained by the use of the Persian wheel, worked by camels or bullocks. Here, water is in general too near the surface to require the use of the draw-well.\n\nIn consequence of this abundant supply, the country continues verdant during the whole year. There are two regular and principal harvests in the year, and generally of crops completely distinct in their kind. The first, called *rubb\u00e9e*, sown in autumn and the beginning of winter, is cut in spring (about the end of April), and consists chiefly of wheat, barley, and pulse of various kinds, usually the staple crops of cooler climates. The second, or *khuseef*, is sown as soon as the other has been cleared away, and is reaped in autumn, the produce being rice, maize, millet, and various other crops proper to hot climates. Peshawer produces the finest rice in the world. It is called Bara rice, because grown on ground irrigated by that river, and Runjeet Singh, ever watchful to secure to himself the best of every thing prized by man, exacted part of his tribute in this valued article. Esculent vegetables are cul-\n\n---\n\nCourt, Memoir on a Map of Peshawur; Elph. Acc. of Caubul, 55; Masson, Bal. Afg. Panj. 131; Moorcr. Punj. Bokh. ii. 337; Burnes, Pol. Power of the Sikhs, 2; Id.

Many of them are of the kinds known in England\u2014carrots, turnips, radishes, cabbages, cauliflowers, onions; others are there of common occurrence in India. As a substitute for hay, corn and certain green crops are cut before ripe and dried for fodder. Barley, and sometimes wheat, are cut before they form ears and used for this purpose, and this treatment does not injure the crop. What is called here *paulaiz*, is a very important portion of the crop, and comprises musk-melons, water-melons, scented-melons, and various kinds of cucumbers, pumpkins, and gourds, produced in the greatest luxuriance, and consumed in the hot season in large quantities. The castor-oil-plant is cultivated; the oil, however, is not intended for culinary or medicinal purposes, but for any other in which a coarse oil may be required. Sesamum, mustard, and some other plants are reared for the sake of their oil. The sugar-cane is raised to be consumed as a sweetmeat; sugar itself being obtained from Hindostan. Ginger, turmeric, tobacco, and cotton, are also extensively cultivated. The ground is moved by the plough, the spade being little employed. Scythes are unknown, and crops of all kinds are cut with sickles. Oxen are used for ploughing, harrowing, and treading out the corn. Mulberry-trees abound, and silk is produced in moderate quantities. The principal fruits are plums, figs, peaches, pomegranates, mulberries, and quinces; but, though large, all except the last have an inferior flavour. The quince of Peshawer is the only fruit that can lay claim to excellence, and it is said to surpass those of all other countries.\n\nElphinstone, who entered the country in March from the great defile, through which the route from the south passes, describes the scene formed by the mountains, crowned with eternal snow, surrounding the luxuriant and picturesque plain, as at once grand and beautiful in the highest degree, and he found that a nearer survey increased his admiration. At the time of Elphinstone\u2019s visit, the population was so dense that thirty-two villages were counted within a circuit of four miles. It may be doubted whether the impressions of the European visitors on this occasion were not somewhat over sanguine, but it was their belief, \u201cthat never was a spot of ground better peopled.\u201d An estimate formed with reference to their views would give about half a million as the number of the inhabitants. Court estimates the military force of the province at 40,000 cavalry and 1,000 infantry. Much\nof the happiness and prosperity then observed had passed away even when Moorcroft visited the country in 1834, and the events of the last few years have occasioned still greater desolation. In its decay, however, after the devastation caused by the Sikhs, Peshawer was estimated to yield a revenue of Rs. 1,000,000 per annum.\n\nThrough this fine province lies the great route from Khorasan and Kabool into India, by the passes of the Khyber mountains and across the Indus at Attock. It is, however, most perilously situated in being exposed to the incursions of the wild inhabitants of the mountains almost everywhere overhanging it, and the difficulty of crossing the Indus greatly embarrasses the communications with the Punjab, which has usually been the seat of more settled and civilized power. The Sikhs, who overrun the country by taking advantage of the dissensions of the Afghans, have regarded the population rather as present enemies than future fellow-subjects, and ruinously devastated both the capital city\u2014Peshawer\u2014and the whole country. The only act apparently at variance with their ordinary course of desolation was the construction of the fortress of Peshawer, and that of Futteghur, at Jamrood, at the eastern extremity of the Khyber pass, to command the passage into the plain. Besides the capital, there is no place of much importance, except the fortress of Hushtnuggur at the northern extremity. Acora, once an important place, is now in ruins.\n\nPESHAWER, or PESHAUUR, the capital of the province of the same name, is situate about twelve miles east of the eastern extremity of the Khyber pass. In the early part of the present century, when visited by Elphinstone, it was a flourishing town, about five miles in circuit, and reported to contain 100,000 inhabitants. Twenty years later, Runjeet Singh, after defeating the Afghans in the decisive battle of Noushera, took Peshawer, demolished the Bala Hissar, at once the capital and state residence\u2014destroyed the fine houses of the chief Afghans\u2014desecrated the mosques, and cutting down the groves and orchards about the city, laid waste the surrounding country. The subsequent exactions and oppressions have effectually prevented its revival. The houses, built of mud or unburnt brick, have flat roofs, on which the inhabitants spend much of their time. The whole city has rather a melancholy\nappearance, presenting numerous ruins of great dimensions, the result, not so much of gradual decay, as of sudden and recent violence. The numerous mosques, many built in a splendid style of oriental architecture, have been intentionally polluted by the Sikhs, and are going to ruin. A vast and magnificent caravansera has been converted into the head-quarters of the Sikh governor. It is called Gorkhutru; it has quadrangular outlines, each side measuring two hundred and fifty yards, and contains extensive accommodation for all departments of government, as well as a spacious house for the governor. The fortress, recently erected by the Sikhs on the site of the Bala Hissar, is a square of about two hundred and twenty yards, and is strengthened by round towers at each angle, every curtain having in front of it a semicircular ravelin. There is a fausse braye all round of substantial towers and curtains, with a wet ditch. The height of the inner walls is sixty feet, of the fausse braye thirty, all constructed of mud. Within, are capacious and well-constructed magazines and storehouses. The only gateway is on the northern face, and it is protected by towers. Court, about ten years ago, estimated the population at 80,000; a mixed race of Afghans, Kashmirians, and Hindoos. It is believed to be now about 50,000. Peshawur was built by the Mogul emperor, Akbar, who affixed the name, signifying \"advanced post,\"* in reference to its being the frontier town of Hindostan towards Afghanistan.

It consists of three small collections of houses, situate close to each other and about four miles from the river. The houses are built of mud, with a framework of deodar or cedar, the materials for which are floated down the river from the mountains to the north. Pind Dadun is a short distance south of the Salt range,* which rising boldly from the right bank of the Jailum, stretches far into Afghanistan. Salt is raised in the vicinity for the supply of a great part of the Punjab. The formation of the rock containing the salt is sandstone, in strata vertical, or nearly so; the layers of salt, about eighteen inches in thickness,\u2020 conform to\n\n* See Salt Range.\n\u2020 According to Burnes, \"none of the layers exceed a foot and half in Bokh. i. 55.\"\nthe arrangement of the rock, and consist of crystallized masses of a reddish tinge and of great brilliancy, which are separated from each other by thin layers of clay. The deposit is worked to great extent, the opening visited by Burnes being a gallery, a thousand feet long, leading into a chamber a hundred feet in height, excavated entirely in salt. The air was found to be very dry, and the temperature about twenty degrees higher than without. The salt is not very pure, and hence is unfit for curing meat. It is, moreover, considered unwholesome, in consequence, according to Burnes, of an admixture of magnesia. It sells at the mouth of the mine for nearly 5l. per ton, or about twenty times the price charged in England. The trade, as is usual in the East, is in the hands of the government, which realized a profit of above 1,000 per cent., and calculated, in the time of Burnes' visit, on obtaining from it an aggregate revenue of about 160,000l. per annum. The quantity raised annually is about 40,000 tons, but might be increased indefinitely, as the mines appear to be inexhaustible. The workings are conducted in the rudest manner, the salt being brought to the surface by unaided human labour, and in this way a man, his wife, and child may earn a rupee a day. The employment is both laborious and unhealthy in a very high degree. Pind Dadun Khan is the great mart for the produce of these mines, the salt being sent through it to be embarked on the Jailum.

In consequence, the Pintecanee has become a salt-water creek. Its entrance is impeded and rendered dangerous by sandbanks; but in the channels there are fifteen feet of water at low tide, and boats of thirty tons can ascend for thirty miles.

A little below this place, Burnes found the channel of the Pinyaree, during the low season, to be a mile broad, with a large sandbank in the middle. It is navigable downwards as far as Mughribee, where a bund, or dam, forty feet broad, was thrown across it by one of the Ameers in 1799. At Mughribee this great watercourse is called the Goongroo. Below this dam it is navigable southwards to the Seer mouth, at which it is two miles wide.\n\nPIR JELALPOOR, in the Punjab, a town near the confluence of the Ghara and Trimab, or Chenaub. It contains a fine Mahometan shrine, covered with lacquered tiles, and adorned with minarets and cupola. There is a good bazaar; and the extensive ruins of brick-built structures in the vicinity indicate that it was formerly a place of importance. Lat. 29\u00b0 28', long. 71\u00b0 16'.\n\nPIR PANJAL,\u00b9 or the Saints' Mountain, a lofty range, forming part of the south-west boundary of Kashmir, and separating it from the Punjab. Its general direction is from north-west to south-east; its length from the Baramula Pass, at the former extremity, to the Pir Panjal Pass, or that of Nandan Sar, at the latter, is about forty miles. Its highest point is supposed to be about in lat. 33\u00b0 40', and is estimated to be 15,000 feet above the sea.\u00b2 According to Vigne, the highest part is basaltic, consisting of amygdaloidal trap, which has upheaved; transition rocks appearing on its borders. Quartz, slate, and other primary formations are observable on the northern or Kashmir side. At the south-western extremity is the pass, generally called the Pir Panjal Pass, or that of Nandan Sar, from a lake of that name near its northern extremity. It is about 12,000 feet high, and, though devoid of trees, is below the limit of perpetual congelation. The name of Pir Panjal, or the Pir's Mountain, has been given, from one\n\n\u00b9 Vigne, i. 204-5, 203.\n\u00b2 F. Von Hugel, i. 238; ii. 163; Bernier, ii. 289; Moorer, ii. 295.\nof its summits being the residence of a *Pir,* or Mahometan saint, who gives benedictions to those who travel over the pass, and also supplies them with refreshments. This pass, though so elevated, must remain open to a late period in the year, as Von H\u00fcgel traversed it in the middle of November, with a numerous train of porters and other attendants from the plain.\n\n**PISHEEN,** in Southern Afghanistan, a table-land, or elevated valley, lying between the Toba and Khojeh Amran mountains and those of Tukatoo, and crossed by the great route from Sinde to Afghanistan, through the Bolan and Kojuck passes. Its elevation varies from 5,000 to 6,000 feet. It is about fifty miles in length from north-east to south-west, and about half as much in breadth. The elevation is very considerable, as the banks of the Lora river, or river of Pisheen, near Hydurzie, being the lowest part of the valley, are 5,000 feet above the level of the sea. Being watered by the above-mentioned river, and possessing the advantages of a fertile soil and moderate climate, it is well suited for agriculture, which receives a large share of the attention of the inhabitants, though some of them are engaged in trade, and in the carrying business between Sinde and Afghanistan, for which their local knowledge and influence well adapt them. The chief products are wheat, artificial grasses, and various European fruits. The majority of the inhabitants are of the Tereen tribe, but there is a great number of Syuds, who claim descent from Mahomet, and bear a decent character for courage and morality, according to the scale of judgment prevailing in these parts. The successful resistance which these people gave to the British under General England, at Hykulzye, seems to justify an opinion creditable to their military spirit. They carry on a considerable trade in horses. Most of them are able to speak Hindostanee. The Tereens are much intermingled with the tribe of Caukers, or Khakas, and the Atchakzais, a clan of the Duranees; and the British force suffered much by their depredations in its passage through the valley.

It is five hundred yards wide at the mouth, is in the shallowest part there nine feet deep at low-water, and eighteen feet at high-water spring-tides, and is navigable for thirty miles for boats of twenty-five tons burthen. The Pittec mouth is in lat. $24^\\circ 41'$, long. $67^\\circ 8'$.\n\nPIWAR, in Afghanistan, a village situate in lat. $33^\\circ 41'$, long. $70^\\circ 3'$.\n\nPODSHEH, in Kashmir, a village situate in lat. $34^\\circ 22'$, long. $74^\\circ 28'$.\n\nPOGHUARA, in the Punjab, a small town on the route from Filor to Amritsir, and sixteen miles north-west of the former place. It is situate in the Doab of Julinder, in a fertile country, having generally a soil of argillaceous loam. The principal inhabitants are Hindoos, engaged in commercial pursuits, or in the cultivation of the fine orchards and gardens which surround the town. Lat. $31^\\circ 15'$, long. $75^\\circ 41'$.\n\nPOKRUN, in Sinde, a halting-place on the route from Sehwan to Kurrachee, and forty-eight miles south of the former town. It is situate on the river, or rather torrent, called, below the Dhurwal and still further downwards, Burran, but here, generally, the river of Pokrun. Though the current intermits for the greater part of the year, there are generally deep pools of good water in the bed. The road in this part of the route is very rocky and broken, and forage and other supplies are scanty. Lat. $25^\\circ 48'$, long. $67^\\circ 50'$.\n\nPOOLAJEE, in Beloochistan, a small town of Cutch Gun-dava, at the southern base of the mountains inclosing the valley of Kahun, and connecting the highlands of Hurrund and Dajel with the Hala range. Here, in the beginning of May 1840, was the rendezvous of a British force marching to garrison Kahun, and thence subsequently, in the close of the following August, an expedition, under Major Clibborn, proceeded to relieve that post. After circumstances beyond human control had caused a disastrous result to the attempt of Major Clibborn, he fell back on Poolajee, with the loss of artillery, ammunition, stores of various kinds, all the beasts of burthen allotted to the expedition, and one hundred and seventy-nine men killed, ninety-two more being wounded. A month afterwards, the garrison of Kahun, having\nevacuated that fort, reached Poolajee in safety.\u2014(See Kahun.) Water is obtained in wells at Poolajee, and the immediate vicinity yields supplies in moderate quantities. The heat in summer is probably as great as in any part of the world. Lat. 29\u00b0 3', long. 68\u00b0 30'.\n\nPOOLKEE, in Scistan, a great ruined town on the right bank of the Helmund, which here flows through a narrow tract of great fertility. The remains of this once extensive and flourishing city exhibit the ruins of ramparts, houses, and gardens, covering an extent of at least sixteen square miles. The river is here about two hundred yards broad, not fordable, and very picturesque. The beautiful and fertile country, formerly densely peopled and highly cultivated, is now occupied only by a few nomadic Belooches, who live in tents, never free from the terror of attacks from their fiercer and more predatory countrymen. Lat. 62\u00b0 30', long. 30\u00b0 30'.\n\nPOOLSINGEE, in Afghanistan, a village six miles south of Kilat-i-Ghiljie, on the road to Kandahar.

It is neatly built, and is situate amidst groves of palm-trees, yielding fine dates, and forming the principal wealth of the inhabitants. This town, with its vicinity, originally held by the Mulikuh sept of Belooches, passed, by the event of war, to the Urbabis, whose chief, the Sirdar of Bunpoor, now holds it. Pottinger describes this people as the fairest tribe of Belooches which he met with, and adds, \"there is a peculiar elevation in their countenances that pre-eminently distinguishes them amongst their countrymen. They are, without almost an exception, tall, handsome men, with great indications of activity. Their predatory character, on which they pride themselves, is sufficiently proved by their deeds.\" It seems, therefore, that the dignity of their physiognomical character is little in accordance with their habits of life. The population of Poora is about 2,000. Lat. 28\u00b0 17', long. 61\u00b0 57'.\n\nPOORALLY, a river of Beloochistan, rising in Jhalawan, flowing southward into Lus, and falling into the Indian Ocean in lat. 25\u00b0 23', long. 66\u00b0 30', a few miles west of Sonmeanee, after a course of a hundred milcs. It is a shallow stream, running over a wide rocky or sandy bed; but when swelled by rains\nit becomes a furious torrent, sweeping along with it trees and stones.

It is 9,500 feet above the sea, and the inhabitants, 600 or 800 in number, are supported by the intercourse on this route, the neighbouring country being too barren to yield them subsistence. Lat. $33^\\circ 33'$, long. $74^\\circ 23'$.\n\nPOTA, in Afghanistan, a village of the district of Jelalabad, is situate on the right bank of the Soorkh Rood, forty miles above its confluence with the Kabool river.

If we consider their northern limit to be in lat. $26^\\circ$, where the Hala range becomes contracted to about thirty miles in breadth, and their southern to be Cape Monze, their length will be found to be about ninety miles. In lat. $25^\\circ 3'$, long. $66^\\circ 50'$, they are crossed by the route from Kurrachee to Sonmeanee, at the pass of Guncloba, described by Hart as \"stony, of trifling ascent, and the descent equally gentle.\" The highest part appears to be about lat. $25^\\circ 30'$, where native report represents the elevation as great, though it does not probably exceed that of the mountains of Western Sinde, considered to be about 2,000 feet.\n\nPUBBERWALEE, in Bhawlpoor, a village between the town of Bhawlpoor and fort of Delawur, and eighteen miles south-west of the former place.

It is a subordinate range to that of Hindoo Koosh, running along its southern base for about a hundred miles, in a direction in some degree parallel to the crest of that stupendous chain; and in general from north-east to south-west. Its northern face forms the southern boundary to the level and fertile valley of Ghurbund; its south-eastern brow overhangs\nthe country near the town of Kabool and the delightful region of\nthe Koh Daman, which is watered by numerous streams flowing\nfrom it. Though close to the location of British engineers for a\nconsiderable length of time, the elevation of its highest part has\nnot been correctly ascertained, but it cannot be less than about\n10,000 feet, and probably far exceeds that amount, as Baber,\nwhose statements are usually very accurate, mentions that it is\nalways covered with snow. By some it has been estimated as\nhigh as 13,000. These mountains are of primary formation.\nThey are bleak, barren, and destitute of vegetation. From this\ndestitution, and the uniformity of their appearance, they add little\nto the beauty of the scenery.

It is situate on the left or southern bank of the\nHelmund, which, when seen at this place by Christie, at the end\nof March, was \"four hundred yards wide, very deep, and with un-\ncommonly fine water.\" The current of the river here appears\nto have excavated a valley, which extends about half a mile from\neach bank, and is bounded right and left by perpendicular cliffs, the brows of which, on both sides, are level with the desert. The narrow valley extending between those cliffs is fertile, and where cultivated and irrigated, by means of channels from the river, highly productive.

It is situate at the foot of the Punch Pass, and on the banks of a river of the same name, discharging itself into the Chenaub. It was formerly the capital of a small independent raj, the raja of which was slain by Gulab Singh, the Sikh chief, who exposed his head, and that of his nephew, in an iron cage. At Punch, two much-frequented routes from the Punjab to Kashmir, that by Koteli and that by Rajawur, meet and proceed thence northward, through the Baramula Pass.

Holding a south-westerly course of about fifty miles, it, near Koteli, receives a considerable feeder, called the river of Rajour, and is supposed ultimately to fall into the Chenaub. There is much obscurity, however, concerning the lower part of its course.\n\nPUNCHSHIR, or PUNJSHIR (five lions), in Afghanistan, an extensive valley furrowing the southern side of Hindoo Koosh. It extends for about sixty miles in a south-westerly direction, from the Khawak Pass, in lat. $35^\\circ 42'$, long. $69^\\circ 53'$, to the dasht of Bagram. The upper extremity has an elevation of 13,200 feet, the lower of about 7,000. The general breadth is about a mile and a half, and it nowhere exceeds three miles. Numerous streams flow down from the inclosing ridges, and discharge themselves into the main river of Punchshir. The inhabitants are careful cultivators, and make the most of their sterile soil, which, scarcely producing a tree of spontaneous growth, is covered with orchards and groves of mulberry and other fruit trees, furnishing the principal means of subsistence to the population. The staple article of food is bread made of mulberries, dried and ground into flour. Every spot capable of producing grain is carefully and successfully cultivated. According to the statement of Wood, who traversed this valley, \"though limited in range, the scenery of Punchshir is soft and beautiful. Its rugged red-tinged surface is dotted over with castellated dwellings, whose square-corner towers and solid walls, rising on every knoll, are relieved by the smiling foliage of fruit trees, and the lively green of the garden-like fields which surround them.\"\n\nThe people are Tajiks, considered to be of Persian descent, and their dispositions and habits are little in harmony with the fair scene described by Wood. Industry seems almost their only virtue. They are infamous for their rapacious and sanguinary crimes, and the valley is a scene of unceasing intestine wars. Notwithstanding this, the population is dense, and on an occasion calling forth public feeling, and suppressing for a time internal hostility, the valley could furnish ten thousand armed men. The inhabitants fight with firelocks and swords, and have the reputa-\n\nVOL. II.\ntion of being good soldiers. Their most formidable enemies are the Siyah Posh Kafirs, who hold the mountains and valleys to the south-east of Punchshir, and make frequent inroads into it, never sparing the lives of those who fall into their hands. In night attacks, the cunning and agility of the Siyah Posh give them the advantage; but in day-time, the firelock of the Punchshir bestows on him the superiority over his more rudely armed enemy. The savage character of these conflicting parties completely stops the intercourse between Turkestan and Afghanistan by the Punchshir route, across Hindoo Koosh, probably the easiest known. The same cause prevents the working of the silver and lead mines, which lie in the upper part of the valley.\n\nThe Punchshiris are bigoted Mahometans of the Sunni persuasion. The name of Punjshir is supposed to have reference to a tradition concerning five sons of Pandu, an ancient monarch of fabulous renown.\n\nPUNCHSHIR RIVER.\u2014See Punjshir.\n\nPUNDEE, in the province of Sarawan, in Beloochistan, a village thirty-five miles north-west of the town of Kelat.

These are pitched amidst ruined vineyards and uncultivated fields, giving evidence of former industry and civilization, the fruits of which have been swept away by the devastating inroads of the nomadic tribes who now hold the soil. The tents are comfortable dwellings, being well provided with fine carpets and other furniture suitable for a migratory race. The Turcoman inmates are rather fair and handsome, though of Tartar physiognomy. They are described by Abbott as living in rude plenty, and, though in general lawless slave-dealers, to\nbe scrupulous in observing the rules of conventional hospitality.

With respect to the propriety of the designation, it is, however, to be observed, that there are in fact six rivers, the Indus, the Jailum, the Chenaub, the Ravee, the Beas, and the Sutlej; but as the Beas has a much shorter course than the others, it seems to have been disregarded when the name of the country was bestowed. In semi-civilized states, and especially in those of Asia, the boundaries, at all times ill-defined, are subject to frequent changes; and this holds true in regard to the territory belonging to the independent Sikhs, a consequence of their incessant wars with their neighbours to the north and west. Any determination of boundary in these directions must therefore be in some degree arbitrary. In the present case the Punjab will be regarded as co-extensive with the empire of the independent Sikhs, with the exception of Peshawer and Damaun, or the Dcrajat, the two provinces of the Sikh empire, which are situated west of the Indus: these form the subject of separate articles, which appear under their respective names. If the Punjab be considered (as in this view it will) to include the recent conquests of the Sikhs over Iskardo,\u00b2 Ladakh,\u00b3 and some other hill states of less importance, it will be found to possess natural limits remarkably well defined. They are as follows:\u2014 on the north, the great mountain range, forming the extension of Hindoo Koosh to the east, and known variously by the names of Kouenlun, Mooz Taugh, and Karakorum;\u2020 on the north-west and west, the Indus; on the east and south-east, the river Sutlej and its continuation, the Ghara. The shape in outline approaches that of the sector of a circle, the centre of which is at the confluence of the Punjunud and the Indus, in lat. 28\u00b0 55', long. 70\u00b0 28'; the extreme radii, the Indus, holding in general a direction not greatly varying from north to south; the Sutlej and its continuation, the Ghara, holding a direction from north-east to south-west;\n\n* \u067e\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0628 from \u067e\u0646\u062c \"five,\" and \u0622\u0628 \"water.\"\n\n\u2020 See Hindoo Koosh.\n\n\u00b9 Wilson, Ariana Antiqua, 195; Remell, 80.\nthe arc in its highest latitude touching the 36th parallel. The most western point is the confluence of the Punjnad and Indus; the most eastern is about the 78th meridian. The length from north-east to south-west, from Nobra in Ladakh to the confluence of the Indus and Punjnad, is about six hundred miles; the breadth, measured at right angles to this from the Sutlej near Rampur, to the Indus at Derbend, about three hundred and fifty; the superficial extent, one hundred and twenty-five thousand square miles.*\n\nThe outline of the extreme territory is almost completely formed by the course of the Indus and that of the Sutlej and its prolongation: the included region is watered or drained by those two great rivers or their feeders, and by the Beas, Ravee, Chenaub, Jailum, and a few others of less magnitude. The country thus marked out is bounded on the north by Bolor, or the unexplored mountain waste, lying between Yarkund and the Kouenlun range, and by Great Tibet; on the east, by Great Tibet and the hill provinces of British India; on the south-east and south, by British India and the state of Bhawlpore; on the west, by Afghanistan; and on the extreme north-west, by the small territory of the independent Dards, by Yessen, Gilgit, and some other petty states.*\n\n* If to this were added the dominions to the west of the Indus, comprising the Daman and Peshawer, containing about 10,000 square miles, the total area of the Sikh empire will be 135,000 square miles. A formal division of the Sikh realm might be thus stated:\n\nPlain of the Punjab.\nDoab of Julunder.\n\u2014\u2014 Barie.\n\u2014\u2014 Reehna.\n\u2014\u2014 Jinbut.\n\u2014\u2014 Sindh Sagur.\n\nMountain region:\nCountry of Gukkers, and neighbouring tribes west of Kashmir.\nKashmir.\nRajpoot country east and south-east of Kashmir.\nLadakh.\nBulti.\n\nTerritory west of the Indus:\nDerajat or Daman.\nPeshawer.\n\nIn addition to this great realm, the ruler of the Punjab holds on the left bank of the Sutlej, and under British protection and control, possessions so considerable as to yield an annual revenue equal to 75,000\u00a3 sterling.\nNo two regions can differ more in physical character than the northern and southern part of this territory. The former is throughout a maze of mountains, in general covered with perpetual snow, and in many places rising into summits not inferior in elevation to any of which there are ascertained measurements. Thus, the height of the mountains on the left bank of the Indus in Rupshu and in the north of Spiti is fixed by Gerard's observation at 27,000 feet, and has been considered by Vigne to be not less than 30,000. These vast masses may be classed into two groups; the southern constituting the western extremity of the Himalaya; the northern separated from the former by the great valley of the Indus, and known as the eastern part of the Hindoo Koosh, or by the names of Kouenlun, Mooz Taugh, and Karakorum. Of these, the southern or Himalayan group has, in consequence of the contact of European civilization, been the better explored, and more full and accurate particulars of its vast elevation have been registered. The statements made with regard to the greatest height of the northern group are vague and unsatisfactory. For instance, Vigne, who reached the actual elevation of 16,000 feet in the mountains of Nubra, reports his having seen from thence that \"the snowy sierra of the Muztak, extending from Hunzeh to Nubra, arose with conspicuous and most majestic grandeur.\"\n\nThe western Himalaya, or southern group, seen from the plain of the eastern Punjab, appears an unbroken chain of snow-clad summits, surpassing in majestic effect those rising farther east, between Undes and Hindostan. Yet, on closer examination, these stupendous ranges are found to embosom many extensive and fertile valleys, forming the hill states of Kulu, Lahoul, and several others. In this range H\u00fcgel mentions the following, occurring in the direction from east to west, as preeminent in height and grandeur:\u2014the Mori, the Sansli range, the Buldawa, the Tricota, and the Ratan Panjal. The heights of none of these appear to be accurately determined, with the exception of that of the Ratan Panjal, which reaches 11,600 feet. Westward still are the mountains in Kashmir, in few places exceeding 15,000 or 16,000 feet.* The mountains in general diminish in height as they stretch westward towards the valley, through which the Indus flows to the south; yet close to the\n\n* See Kashmir, table of heights.\nbank of that river the summits of the Diarmul exhibit an elevation and grandeur scarcely inferior to any in the Himalaya.\n\nAs seen by Vigne, \"mountain seemed piled upon mountain to sustain a most stupendous confusion of mist and glacier glistening with the dazzling and reciprocated brightness of snow and sunbeam, and whose outlines, pre-eminently bold, precipitous, and majestic, were rendered still more so by being discernible only for an instant.\"\n\nThe mountains inclosing the valley of the Indus are generally of primitive formation, granite, felspar, quartz, gneiss, mica slate, roofing slate. The elevated table-land of Deotsun is of granite. In Rupshu, Spiti, and the adjacent part of Ladakh, mountain ranges of great extent and vast height have been ascertained to consist of secondary formations, in many places abounding with fossil remains. In Kashmir and the adjacent regions, the prevailing rocks are those generally attributed to volcanic action, such as basalt, trap, and gypsum, and these are overlaid in some parts with vast masses of limestone, containing numerous organic relics. Jacquemont enumerates, as the prevailing rocks of this region, sienitic granite, quartz of various colours, grauwacke, limestone, schistose rocks of various forms, in general in transition from grauwacke to limestone, oolitic iron ore.\n\nIf a line be drawn in a north-westerly direction from the Sutlej, close to Ropur, and in lat. 31\u00b0, long. 76\u00b0 30', to Torbela, on the Indus, in lat. 34\u00b0 18', long. 72\u00b0 44', the section of the Sikh territory to the north-east of it, comprising about three-sevenths of the portion east of the Indus, will, with little exception, be found to be an Alpine region, with an elevation scarcely anywhere short of 5,000 feet, for the most part varying from 10,000 to 20,000, and in some instances approaching to 30,000. South-west of the supposed line, the surface slopes rapidly to the alluvial plain of the Punjab, which stretches in that direction several hundred miles, with scarcely any considerable eminences, except the salt range, connected with the southern base of the Himalaya by a maze of hills, forming a very rough, rocky, and difficult country. Burnes, who describes it as \"a mountainous and rugged country, of great strength,\" says\u2014\"Our road lay in ravines. The chaos of rocks, their vertical strata terminating in needles from decomposition, the round pebbles that lay imbedded in the sandstone, and the wild scenery,\nmade this an interesting neighbourhood.\" About the town of Mundi, near the eastern frontier, and on the upper course of the Beas, in the most southern and lower ranges of the Himalaya, is an extensive tract of rocks and deposits, of recent formation, limestone, sandstone, gypsum, argillaceous slate, amidst which veins of quartz occasionally occur. This formation is important, in consequence of containing inexhaustible beds of fossil salt,* very compact and heavy, and of a reddish colour. On the west of the Punjab, and crossing the Doab, between the Jailum and the Indus, is the Salt range, which is cross-cut by the channel of the Indus, and which, to the north of the Daman, on the western side of that river, joins the Suliman and Khyber ranges. The Salt range, sometimes (on the west of the Indus) called the Kalabagh range, holds a direction a little south of east, between lat. $32^\\circ 30'$\u2014$33^\\circ$, and terminates rather abruptly on the right bank of the river Jailum. The elevation is not great, probably in few places exceeding 2,000 feet above the sea. The formations composing it are grauwacke, limestone, sandstone, gypsum, and red tenacious clay, investing enormous deposits of common salt, or chloride of sodium. (See Salt Range and Pind Dadun Khan.)\n\nAltogether, the ascertained mineral wealth of the Punjab and its dependencies appears scanty in proportion to the great extent of its mountains. Gold is found in the sands of the streams of Bulti and Ladakh, also in those of the Chenaub, the Huroo, and the Swan. Kashmir yields copper, lead, and iron. Graphite or plumbago abounds in the Pir Panjal, bounding Kashmir on the south-west. Iron is also raised in Mundi, as well as common salt. The Salt range, besides the mineral from which it is named, produces antimony, alum, and sulphur. Nitre is obtained in abundance from the alluvial plains. Coal exists about the Salt range at Mukkud, on the left bank of the Indus, and in the localities of Joa, Mecalee, and Nummul.\n\n* Moorcroft states that the salt of this tract is found in grauwacke; the occurrence of this rock is not mentioned by Jacquemont.\n\n\u2020 Dr. Jameson, an agent of the Anglo-Indian government, despatched to obtain information respecting the coal measures which Wood and Burnes reported they had examined in the Salt range, stated his opinion as follows: \"To the question, Is any good coal to be found in quantity in this...\"\n### TABLE OF HEIGHTS.\n\n| Location | Latitude | Longitude | Height (Feet) |\n|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Summit on the left bank of the Indus, in Rupshu | $33^\\circ 20'$ | $78^\\circ$ | 27,000 |\n| Summit on frontier of Rupshu and Spiti | about lat. $33^\\circ$, long. $78^\\circ 30'$ | | 24,000 |\n| Limit of perpetual snow in Northern Spiti | lat. $33^\\circ 30'$, long. $78^\\circ 40'$ | | 22,000 |\n| Highest summit ascended by Gerard on eastern frontier of Spiti | lat. $33^\\circ 5'$, long. $78^\\circ 40'$ | | 20,400 |\n| Mountain rising north of Lake Chamoreril | lat. $33^\\circ$, long. $78^\\circ$ | | 20,000 |\n| Diarmul or Nanga Parbut mountain, north of Kashmir | lat. $35^\\circ 10'$, long. $74^\\circ 20'$ | | 19,000 |\n| Summit of range between the basins of the Beas and Sutlej | lat. $31^\\circ 40'$, long. $77^\\circ 20'$ | | 18,000 |\n| Lacha range, between Lahoul and Rupshu | lat. $32^\\circ 40'$, long. $77^\\circ 20'$ | | 17,000 |\n| Bara Lacha, or Para Lassa Pass, over Lacha range | about same lat. and long. as last | | 16,500 |\n| Skora, a summit in Kouenlun or Mooz Taugh, north of Bultistan | about lat. $35^\\circ 30'$, long. $76^\\circ$ | | 16,200 |\n| Source of Surajbaga, branch of the Chenaub | lat. $33^\\circ 12'$, long. $77^\\circ 22'$ | | 16,200 |\n| Pass in the mountains north of Le | lat. $34^\\circ 15'$, long. $77^\\circ 20'$ | | 16,000 |\n| Table-land of Rupshu | lat. $33^\\circ$, long. $78^\\circ$ | | 16,000 |\n\n---\n\ndistrict? we would at once answer, decidedly not.\" This dictum will probably seem precipitate and rash to those who know that the important coal fields of Flintshire, Denbighshire, and Gloucestershire are connected with the saliferous deposits of Cheshire and Worcestershire.

The stream which passes by Peshawer falls into the Kabool river about fourteen miles below the city, and, as its course lies through a plain, the fall to its confluence probably does not exceed two feet in a mile. From that confluence the course of the Kabool river to its junction with the Indus at Attok is about forty miles, and as it is navigable for this distance, its fall cannot much exceed a foot per mile. This would make the elevation of the bed of the Indus at Attok about 1,000 feet.\nany eminence of importance. The declivity of the surface from north-east to south-west is proved beyond question by the course of the rivers, which all descend in that direction. Jacquemont considers that the courses of the Sarsouty and Gagra, which, flowing from the Himalaya, are lost in the desert of Bikanir, lie along an elevated tract dividing the basin of the Jumna from that of the Sutlej, and that barometric and other observations prove the plain of the Punjab to be below that of Eastern Hindostan. He thence concludes the bed of the Sutlej, in its course through the plain, to be lower than that of the Jumna; that of the Beas lower than that of the Sutlej, and so in succession westward with regard to the beds of the Ravee, the Chenaub, and the Jailum, to the Indus, flowing through the lowest part of this extensive basin.\n\nNo country of the same extent probably enjoys more largely than the Punjab the means of irrigation, and of inland navigation, by means of its six noble rivers. The most eastern, the Sutlej,* is generally believed to issue from the lake Rawan Radd,\u2020 in Undes, in lat. $30^\\circ 59'$, long. $81^\\circ$. Holding a south-westerly course of about five hundred miles,\u2021 it receives the Beas, below the confluence of which, taking place near Hurekee, and in lat. $31^\\circ 12'$, long. $74^\\circ 55'$, the united stream is called the Ghara for about three hundred miles to the confluence of the Trimab; thenceforward the aggregate body of water bears the name of the Punjab for a further distance of about sixty miles to its confluence with the Indus. Next to the Sutlej, westward, is the Beas,\u2021 rising in lat. $32^\\circ 34'$, long. $77^\\circ 12'$,\u00a7 and holding a sinuous course of about two hundred and twenty miles, in general to the southwest, to its confluence with the Sutlej.

Issuing from a lake embosomed in the Himalaya, in lat. $32^\\circ 30'$, long. $76^\\circ 36'$, it holds a very tortuous course, but generally in a south-westerly direction, for about four hundred and fifty miles to its confluence with the Chenaub. This last-mentioned river,* usually regarded as the largest of the Punjab, flows in general west of that of the Ravee, though its source is more eastward as it sweeps in a wide flexure round the upper part of the smaller rivers. Rising in Lahoul, in lat. $32^\\circ 30'$, long. $77^\\circ 40'$, the Chenaub pursues a circuitous course, but for the most part south-west, and at the distance of about five hundred and forty miles from its source, unites with the Jailum near Trimo Ferry.\u2020 The united stream, proceeding in the same direction for about fifty miles, receives the water of the Ravee;\u2021 below the confluence it loses the name of Chenaub, and is called the Trimab \u2020 for a farther distance of a hundred and ten miles to the junction of the Ghara. From that point the river flows about sixty miles, as before mentioned, to its confluence with the Indus, being called the Punjnad,\u2021 a name derived from its conveying the accumulated water of the Beas, the Sutlej, the Ravee, the Chenaub, and the Jailum. This last river, the most westerly, except the Indus, rises in Kashmir,\u00a7 the whole valley of which it drains. Soon after its issue therefrom, it receives a large tributary, the Kishengunga, or river of Mazfurabad, and after a course of about four hundred and fifty miles, generally in a south-westerly direction, it unites with the Chenaub near Trimo Ferry.\u00a7 The Indus forms the western boundary of the Punjab for about five hundred miles from Derbend, in the north, to the confluence of the Punjnad. These noble streams, besides their inestimable value for the purposes of irrigation, afford means of inland navigation scarcely equalled. Thus the Indus is navigable to Attok,\u2020 the Jailum to Oin,\u2020 the Chenaub\u2020 to Aknur, the Ravee\u00a7 to Lahore, the Sutlej to Ropur.\u2020 There does not appear to be any direct and certain\n\n* Considered to be the Acesines\u2020 of the classical writers.\n\n\u2020 From \u062a\u0631\u06cc \u201cthree,\u201d and \u0622\u0628 \u201cwater.\u201d\n\n\u2021 From \u067e\u0646\u062c \u201cfive,\u201d and \u0631\u0648\u062f \u201ca river.\u201d\n\n\u00a7 The Jailum is considered to be the Hydaspes\u2020 of the classical writers; the Bitastha, or Vitastha, of the Sanscrit.\ninformation as to the extent of navigation of the Beas, but as its volume of water is not inferior\\(^1\\) to that of the Sutlej, it may with probability be concluded that vessels can ascend nearly to its efflux from the base of the Himalaya, or for a distance of about eighty miles. Thus the inland navigation of the Punjab may be stated as follows:\n\n| MILES |\n|-------|\n| Indus, from Attok to Mittun-kote | ... | ... | ... | 480 |\n| Punjnad | ... | ... | ... | ... | 60 |\n| Trimab | ... | ... | ... | ... | 110 |\n| Jailum, from confluence with the Chenaub to Oin | ... | ... | ... | 300 |\n| Jailum, in the valley of Kashmir | ... | ... | ... | ... | 70 |\n| Chenaub, as far as Aknur | ... | ... | ... | ... | 300 |\n| Ravee, as far as Lahore | ... | ... | ... | ... | 180 |\n| Beas | ... | ... | ... | ... | 80 |\n| Ghara | ... | ... | ... | ... | 280 |\n| Sutlej | ... | ... | ... | ... | 100 |\n| **Total** | ... | ... | ... | ... | **1,960** |\n\nIn the plain of the Punjab, there are no considerable pieces of standing water. In the mountain region Kashmir contains three lakes\u2014the city Dal,\\(^2\\) or Lake; the Wulur,\\(^3\\) and Manasa Bul.\\(^4\\) In Ladakh are the two great salt lakes\u2014that of Pangkung,\\(^5\\) and that of Chamomeril;\\(^6\\) and another, called Thogjichenmo,\\(^7\\) of much smaller dimensions. There are many other pieces of water in the mountain region, but all of too inconsiderable dimensions to be designated as lakes.\n\nThe plain of the Punjab is divided by its rivers into five extensive natural sections, described by the native term *doab,* signifying a great tongue of land lying in the bifurcation above the confluence\\(^*\\) of two rivers. First, the doab of Julinder,\\(^8\\) between the Sutlej and the Beas; second, the doab of Barie, between the Beas and Ghara on the east, and the Ravee and Trimab on the west; third, the doab of Rechna, between the Ravee and Trimab on the east, and the Chenaub on the west; fourth, the doab of Jinhut, between the Chenaub on the east, and the Jailum on the west; fifth, the doab of Sinde Sagur, between the Jailum,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Macartney, in Elph. 602; Burnes' Bohk. i. 7.\n\n\\(^2\\) Moorer.

Of these, that of Sinde Sagur is the most extensive, but that of Barie by far the most populous, as well as the most important, whether in a political, a commercial, or an agricultural point of view.\n\nThe regular and gradual slope of the great plain of the Punjab has been mentioned. Even the upper part is but of moderate elevation. Thus, Amritsir\\(^9\\) and Lahore\\(^1\\) are each 900 feet above the level of the sea, Jailum about 1,600, and the surface slopes regularly to the south-western extremity, where close to Mit-tunkote, the elevation is about 220 feet.\\(^2\\) In consequence of the nearly unbroken flatness of the surface, the great rivers frequently change their courses in an extraordinary degree. \"Bands of sand traverse the country in a north and south direction, which point out the old beds of rivers, and prove that all of them have been changed. The Sutlej, which formerly ran close to the town of Loodianah, is now seven miles to the northward; the Ravee, which twenty years ago washed the walls of the city of Lahore, runs in a channel three miles off to the northward; the Chenaub, which ten or twelve years ago ran close to the town of Ramnuggur, is now four miles distant, and the same applies to the Jailum.\"\\(^3\\) So the Ghara, at no great distance of time, held, for above two hundred miles, a course considerably westward of the present and parallel to it.\n\nElphinstone\\(^4\\) says, \"The fertility of the Punjab appears to have been too much extolled by our geographers; except near rivers, no part will bear a comparison with the British provinces in Hindostan, and still less with Bengal, which it has been thought to resemble. In the part I passed through, the soil was generally sandy and by no means rich; the country nearer the hills was said to be better, and that further to the south worse; of the four divisions (doabs) east of the Hydaspes, the two nearest to that river are chiefly pastured on by herds of oxen and buffaloes, and that more to the east, towards the Hysudrus or Sutlej, though most sterile, is best cultivated. The two former are quite flat, the latter is wavy; there is not a hill to the east of the Hydaspes, and rarely a tree, except of the dwarf race of Baubool (mimosa). On the whole, not a third of the country we saw was cultivated.\"\\(^5\\) The most westerly doab, or that of Sinde Sagur, is probably the least productive, as the Salt range, and the rugged country be-\ntween it and Attock, extend over it on the north, and the arid wilds, called by Elphinstone\\(^5\\) the Little Desert, form nearly the whole of the southern part.\\(^6\\) According to that eminent authority,\\(^6\\) the Little Desert extends from north to south upwards of two hundred and fifty miles, with a width, which was traversed by him in two marches, probably measuring together between thirty and forty miles. It occupies all that part of the country between the Jailum and the Indus which is not flooded by both those rivers, and extends northward from the thirtieth degree of latitude, where the inundated lands terminate, to the Salt range, seeming to be a part of the great desert of Rajpootana, cut off from the main body by the rivers and their rich banks. The outline being strongly marked and abrupt, the traveller, on leaving the fertile country, at once finds himself amongst sand-hills and the stunted shrubs and plants congenial to such tracts, and must be content with brackish water obtained from wells. The colour of the sand here is grey instead of the reddish-yellow of the Great Desert. The narrow tract, forming the southern part of the doab of Sinde-i-Sagur, is, however, rich and fertile through the entire breadth from one river to the other.\\(^7\\) In the north also of this doab a tract of great fertility,\\(^8\\) having a soil of black loam, extends for about thirty miles along the right bank of the Jailum, between the town of that name and Pind Dadun Khan. The small doab of Jab Jinhut, between the Jailum and Chenaub, is barren and little cultivated. Jacquemont,\\(^8\\) who from the Salt range viewed this doab in nearly its whole extent, describes it as a monotonous plain, broken by only one small hill which rises above the town of Lallee. It is thus noticed by Burnes:\\(^9\\) \"Nothing, however, can be more miserable than the country between the Acesines and Hydaspes; a sterile waste of underwood, the abode of shepherds, scantily supplied with water, which is sixty-five feet below the surface.\"\\(^9\\) The doab of Reechna, though having in general a sandy soil, is a little more fertile and better cultivated than that just noticed. By means of wells, water can everywhere be obtained at a depth not exceeding twenty-five feet.\\(^1\\) The soil and climate are suitable for the growth of the sugar-cane, and fruits and flowers are produced in great profusion, variety, and luxuriance.\\(^2\\) Burnes\\(^3\\) describes a garden visited by him, \"as not a hundred yards square, but well stored with fruit-trees and flowers; most of the former,\" he adds, \"were now in blossom, and an enumeration of them...\"\nwould give a favourable idea of this climate: they consisted of the peach, apricot, greengage, fig, pomegranate, quince, orange (sweet and bitter), lime and lemon, guava, grape, mango, jamboe, bair, date, cardamom, almond, and the apple, with seven or eight other kinds, of which I can only give the native names,\u2014the gooler, sohaujna, goolcheen, umltass, bell, bussoora. The walks of the garden were lined with beautiful cypresses and weeping willows; and in the flower-beds were the narcissus and rosc-bushes of the sidburg, or an hundred leaves.\u201d \u201cMost of the trees and flowers are indigenous, but many have been introduced.\u201d Still the cultivation is very limited in proportion to the qualities of the soil and the facilities for irrigation. From the elevation of the beds of the rivers, watercourses, and sources about the southern base of the mountains, and from the regular uninterrupted slope of the surface of the Punjab to the south, it is obvious that fertilizing streams might be conducted so as to spread abundance over most parts of that fine plain. The upper part of the doab between the Ravee and the Beas is at present sterile, from want of irrigation, as the canals made for this purpose during the Mogul dynasty have been allowed to fall to decay. In consequence of this neglect, the soil has become \u201ca hard, indurated clay; sometimes gravelly, producing thorny shrubs and brambles, called by the natives jund, kureel (wild caper bush) and baubool (mimosa).\u201d Lower down, the soil of this doab appears, from Masson\u2019s report, to be in general strong, and rather fertile, but little cultivated, and in consequence overrun with jungle and small woods. At the southern extremity, in the vicinity of Mooltan, the country is highly productive. According to the statement of Burnes, \u201cthe soil amply repays the labour, for such is its strength, that a crop of wheat, before yielding its grain, is twice mowed down as fodder for cattle, and then ears,\u201d he continues, \u201cand produces an abundant harvest. The indigo and sugar crops are rich, and one small strip of land, five miles long, which we passed, afforded a revenue of seventy-five thousand rupees.\u201d Tobacco, dates, and mangoes are produced in abundance and excellence. Jameson, probably the latest authority on the subject, thus describes the actual state of the Punjab:\u2014\u201cAt the present moment, the vast plain presents nothing but a waste, comparatively speaking, with here and there cultivation. Even in the neighbourhood of the very capital itself we meet with ex-\ntensive jungles, the luxuriance of their rank vegetation shewing what the country could be made.\u201d \u201cWe pass over vast uncultivated tracts, with here and there, in the centre of the bushy jungle, a small village, with some rich, cultivated fields around. Now and then, breaking up the monotony of the flat plain, we meet with the hillocks marking the sites of towns and villages which are now no more, but of which the streets and houses have left this memento of their former existence.\u201d\n\nThe climate of the mountainous regions, Ladakh, Kashmir, Bulti, Kulu, and Lahoul, is described in the respective notices on those places; that of the plain of the Punjab is in general characterized by dryness and warmth. Little rain falls, except in those parts extending along the southern base of the Himalaya, and where the south-west monsoon is partially felt, diminishing in its effect in proportion as it proceeds westward. According to the statement of Elphinstone, the rain \u201cin the north of the Punjab exceeds that of Delhi; but in the south of the Punjab, distant both from the sea and the hills, very little rain falls.\u201d Still the rains of the monsoon extend as far as Lahore, and fall heavily there in midsummer. In the more southern part of the plain, the soil, where productive, is rendered so by irrigation. In addition to the facilities offered by the rivers and canals, the Persian wheel is employed to draw to the surface the water of numerous wells. The winters are cool even to the feelings of a European. Elphinstone observes, in regard to his residence in Mooltan, at the end of December: \u201cThe weather was delightful during our stay; the thermometer, when at the lowest, was at 28\u00b0 at sunrise; there were slight frosts in the night.\u201d During the march of the English army through this country in 1838, thin ice was formed on the water at the end of December, whilst in the day the thermometer rose to 70\u00b0. At the end of December, Elphinstone, marching through the doab between the Chenaub and the Indus, found a very cold wind; but it does not appear that snow falls in this part of the Punjab. Burnes describes the weather in the beginning of February as cold and bleak, frequently rainy, and always cloudy. In January, 1839, the lowest state of the thermometer was found, on different nights of the month, to be respectively 34\u00b0, 37\u00b0, 38\u00b0, 41\u00b0. In the day the thermometer, even in midwinter, is seldom below 70\u00b0, and in January generally reaches 80\u00b0, so that vegetation rapidly proceeds,\nand the wheat harvest is gathered by the end of April. Such, during winter, is the general temperature of the Punjab south of the Salt range. North of that, and even outside the limits of the mountains, the cold is greater, an effect attributable to a slight increase of elevation rather than to change of latitude. The British, in marching through that tract in December, 1839, found the cold severe, the thermometer during the night sinking to $2^\\circ$ below the freezing point.\n\nThe heat in summer is excessive; in the plains at Mooltan it is so great as to be proverbial. At Lahore it was found, in the beginning of June, to raise the thermometer to $112^\\circ$, in a tent artificially cooled. A traveller who experienced the heat of this season describes it as \"perfectly intolerable; we are unable,\" he adds, \"to eat, drink, or sleep, and support existence by suction alone.\" Bernier, who had endured the heat of the most sultry part of Arabia, found that of the country between Lahore and Kashmir much more distressing, and each morning entertained a dread of being unable to survive till the evening. He describes his body as having become as it were a dry sponge, and he no sooner took a draught of water than it oozed from all parts of his skin, from which the cuticle had peeled, leaving the surface covered with pustules. Some of his companions died of heat even in the shade.\n\nThe indigenous vegetation of the plain of the Punjab closely resembles that of the drier tracts of Eastern Hindostan; trees are scarce, and there occur extensive tracts containing only a few bushes, principally babools of the mimosa species. Even the date-palm is, according to Burnes, an exotic, introduced by the Mahometan invaders. The wild palm, a species which produces no fruit, is in many places abundant; as are the peloo (Salvadora Persica), various species of willows, the pepool (ficus religiosa), divers species of acacias and tamarisk, the byr-apple or ju-jube (zizyphus ju-juba), and capparis, called here kureel, juwassi, or camel-thorn; the talee, a tree called sissoo in Eastern Hindostan, and sometimes of twelve feet girth, useful for boat-building; the neem (melia azadurachta), the mudar (trop\u00e6a), the toolsce (ocymum sanctum), kurmul, or wild rue. Fuel is scarce, in consequence of the general absence of trees, and cow-dung is extensively used for the purpose. The towns and villages of the Punjab are, however, generally surrounded by groves, but these are\nusually of forced fruit-trees artificially cultivated,\u2014date, orange, pomegranate, mulberry, apple, fig, peach, apricot, plum, quince, almond, and a few others of less importance. The mango is cultivated, but does not attain high perfection except about Mooltan, and deteriorates in proportion to the advance northward.\n\nThe zoology of the Punjab is more rich and varied than its botany. No accounts afford authority for concluding that elephants exist there in a state of nature, for though Arrian mentions the hunting of elephants on the banks of the Indus, the animals in question clearly appear to have been some turned loose by the natives in their hasty flight. Tigers lurk in the jungle and forests, and sometimes attain the enormous length of ten feet. Lions are not uncommon. The other beasts of prey are panthers, leopards, hyenas, lynxes, wolves, bears, jackals, foxes, otters, martins, stoats, and divers other small viverrae; there are also nilgaus, wild hogs, porcupines, various animals of the deer, goat, and antelope species, monkeys and bats, including the large and hideous vampyre, deemed sacred by the natives. Among the feathered tribes there are pea-fowl, parrots, jungle-fowl (the wild stock of our common domestic fowl), pheasants, various kinds of partridges, quails, water-fowl in great number and variety, herons, cranes, pelicans, eagles, vultures, hawks, magpies, hoopoes, and doves of various kinds. The bulbul, or nightingale of Kashmir, is inferior in note to that of Europe, but very beautiful. A small species of alligator swarms in the rivers, especially the Jailum. The porpoise ascends the Indus to a great distance. Among serpents, the more remarkable are the cobra di capello, and a small snake, the bite of which is almost immediately fatal. The rivers abound with fish; the pulla, a delicious species of carp, swarming in the Indus, forms an important article of subsistence. Of insects, the silk-worm thrives remarkably, and produces an article of admirable quality; bees also produce wax and honey in great abundance and of the finest kind, and this department of husbandry receives great attention, particularly in Kashmir. The more important domestic animals are the camel (especially in the south) and the buffalo, of which great herds are kept in the neighbourhood of rivers, these animals being almost of an amphibious nature. Horses are bred extensively, especially in the plain country in the north-east, and receive great attention, the Sikhs being an equestrian people.\nThe more important crops in the low, level, and fertile tracts, are indigo, cotton, sugar, tobacco, opium, wheat, which is abundant and in quality excellent; buck-wheat, rice, barley, millet, jowar (holcus sorghum), bajre (holcus spicatus), moong (phascolus mungo), maize, various sorts of vetches, oil-seeds, such as sesamum and mustard; peas and beans, carrots, turnips, onions, melons, cucumbers, and sundry kinds of cucurbitaceous plants. So plentiful is wheat, that it sells at Mooltan at from half a rupee to a rupee per maund. Bhang, or hemp, is produced for the purpose of inducing intoxication; saffron, safflower for dyes, and a great number of less important products. Milk, butter, and wool are very important objects of rural economy, the former being almost the only produce of the numerous herds of kine, as the slaughtering of these animals for food is not allowed by the Sikhs.\n\nThe manufacturing industry of the Punjab is considerable. It is exercised principally in the silk and cotton productions of Amritsir, Lahore, Mooltan, Shoojahbad, Leia, and some other places in the south; the fabrication of arms in Lahore; the shawl-weaving and manufacture of leather and of arms in Kashmir. Much of the commerce of the Punjab consists in the transit of the goods of Hindostan to the countries west of the Indus. The chief marts are Amritsir, Leia, and Mooltan, Lahore being in this respect of inferior importance. The imports from British India are principally sugar, spices, and other groceries, dye-stuffs, cotton, woollen, and silk cloths; metals, and utensils of various kinds of metal; ivory, precious stones, glass, porcelain, and cutlery. From the west, the imports are gold, turquoises, silver, silk, madder, cochineal, assafoetida, safflower, fruits (fresh and dried), wool, horses, and a few of the more portable manufactures of Russia. The exports, whether in the way of transit or the produce of the country, are grain, ghee, or clarified butter, hides, wool, silk and cotton fabrics, carpets, shawls, silk, cotton, indigo, tobacco, gold, horses, and hawks, which last are so considerable an article of commerce as to bring Rs. 10,000 annually.\n\nThe population consists of various races. The regions\n\n* Leeoh (Report of the Commerce of Mooltan, p. 88) mentions hides as an article of commerce in the Punjab; they must be taken off kine which have died of disease or age.\nnorth and north-west of Kashmir are generally inhabited by Tibetans belonging to the Mogol variety of man. A small portion of the country included between the Kishengunga and the Indus, north of the Salt range, is held by the Eusufzye Afghans, and Patans, the descendants of former Afghan conquerors, are scattered over the country in small numbers, as well as a few Moguls. The rest of the population is of Hindoo descent, though probably the majority have become converts to Mahometanism. This Hindoo stock may be classed as Kashmirians; Rajpoots holding the mountain tracts of Mundi, Jamu, Kishtewar, Rajawar, and other small districts east of Kashmir; Gukers holding part of the country between the upper part of the Jailum and the Indus; and Punjabis, the greater part of whom are descendants from the Rajpoot tribe of Jats.* The only authority worth notice in regard to the amount of the population is Burnes, whose statement, however, is neither very explicit, nor invested with much pretension to accuracy. \"It is with distrust,\" he says, \"that I attempt an enumeration of the people subject to the Punjab, but I am informed that the Khalsa, or Sikh population, does not exceed 500,000 souls, and the remainder is composed of Sikhs, Mahometans, and Hindoo Juts, who may amount to 3,000,000.\" From various data, though far from satisfactory, an approximate computation may be made of the total population of the Sikh empire.\n\n| Population Group          | Number       |\n|---------------------------|--------------|\n| Punjabis                  | 3,500,000    |\n| Ladakhis                  | 160,000      |\n| Bultis                    | 80,000       |\n| Kashmirians \u2020             | 300,000      |\n| Other hill tribes         | 150,000      |\n| Afghans of the territory west of the Indus | 500,000 |\n| Afghans of the Punjab     | 50,000       |\n| **Total**                 | **4,740,000** |\n\nThe Sikhs are, for the most part, concentrated about their\n\n* In the notice on Kashmir (i. 369) the amount of the population of the valley is estimated at 200,000, but great numbers of its native race are scattered through the neighbouring countries.\ncapitals, Amritsir and Lahore. The belief of this sect was originally, according to Malcolm,\\(^2\\) a pure deism, but has so far degenerated that they now consider their founder entitled to divine honours, and regard him as a saviour and mediator with God. Their faith admits the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, either as a punishment, or a remedial process for moral deficiency, and of a future state of bliss for the good. To kill kine is considered by them a horrible impiety. Tobacco\\(^3\\) is prohibited, but fermented liquors are allowed, and no kind of food is forbidden except beef. Malcolm\\(^4\\) lays down the following as the great points by which they are separated from the strict Hindoos: \u2014the renunciation of the distinctions of castes, the admission of proselytes, and the rendering the pursuit of arms not only allowable, but the religious duty of all. The sect, though it has but recently become powerful, was founded by Nanac, who was born in 1469 at Raypur,\\(^5\\) sixty miles west of Lahore, and received the name of Guru,\\(^*\\) or \u201cspiritual pastor,\u201d from his votaries, who themselves assumed the appellation of Sikhs,\\(^\u2020\\) or \u201cdisciples.\u201d His followers were at first peaceable and humble, and remained so until the murder, by the Mahometans, of their fourth Guru in succession from Nanac, on which event his successor, Har Govind, in revenge, drew the sword which has never since been sheathed. Guru Govind, the fifth in succession from Har Govind, and the tenth from Nanac, is regarded as the founder of the temporal power of the Sikhs. His votaries were instructed by him always to bear arms, or at least steel in some form or other, about them, and to assume the name of Singh, or lion, previously affected only by the Rajpoots. By this name they are distinguished from the other Sikhs or followers of Baba Nanak. They ceased to have any spiritual leader \\(\\dagger\\) after the death of Govind,\\(^6\\) who was killed in 1708, and from that period until the power of Runjeet Singh became paramount, they constituted a turbulent and irregular republic, holding, in cases\\(^7\\) of great emer-\n\n\\(^*\\) Guru.\n\n\\(^\u2020\\) Sikh.\n\n\\(\\dagger\\) So states Foster,\\(^1\\) whose account is consistent, and probably accurate, and seems to be corroborated by that of Jacquemont,\\(^2\\) in his notice of Amritsir\u2014\u201cCette Rome du Pendj\u00e2b n\u2019a point de pape.\u201d Burnes, however, makes mention of \u201cthe head of the Sikh church, the Bedee or Sahib Sing.\u201d\n\n\\(^1\\) v. 63.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bokh, ii. 286.\n\n\\(^3\\) Masson, i. 410.\n\n\\(^4\\) 180.\n\n\\(^5\\) Forster, Beng.

Runjeet viewed the congregated meetings at Amritsir with great jealousy, and built at that place the great fortress of Govindghur,8 ostensibly to protect, but actually to overawe and control the excited followers of Govind, who resorted there. Those Sikhs who adhere to the original doctrines of Nanac are called Khalasa; they are less fanatical and warlike than the Singhs or followers of Guru Govind. Of these latter, a peculiar class is called Acalis,9 or immortals, and sometimes Nihungs. Their fanaticism, Burnes observes, borders on insanity, and they seem to be at war with all mankind. They go about heavily armed, frequently bearing a drawn sword in each hand, two other swords in their belts, a matchlock on their back, and on their turbans iron quoits six or eight inches in diameter, with their outer edges sharpened, and these, it is asserted, they throw with such force, as well as precision of aim, as to lop off the leg of a horse, or even of an elephant. Osborne,2 however, who has frequently seen them try their skill, found them to be very bungling, and the missile in their hands to be very inefficient. They are a lawless and sanguinary class, and would have rendered the country desolate, had they not been vigorously coerced by Runjeet Singh.\n\nThe sacred books of the Sikhs are called Granth (scripture). The principal of them are the Adi-Granth, composed by Nanac, their first Guru, and the Das Padshah ke Granth, composed by Guru Govind, their last spiritual guide. They charge in battle to the war-cry, Wai! Guruji ka Fath, \u201cO Victory to our master the Guru!\u201d Their religious animosity is principally directed against the Mahometans, the slaughter of whom is enjoined in their Granth, while they are commanded merely to plunder and beat the Hindoos; yet great numbers of both are allowed to live under their sway, free, for the most part, from substantial injury, though treated with much contumely and exposed to many annoyances. The Mahometans especially are not allowed to pray in public, and they are subjected to a cruel death if detected in eating beef. The Sikhs carried their hatred of Islam so far as to devise and extensively to use a vocabulary3 composed of terms which, while expressive of matters relating\nto ordinary affairs, at the same time conveyed the most degrading and insulting allusion to Mahometanism.*\n\nThe Sikhs indulge in the grossest debauchery,\\(^4\\) not excepting that species from which nature revolts; and among those addicted to this detestable vice, their late ruler, Runjeet Singh, attained an odious pre-eminence. As soldiers they appear in a more respectable light. Their repeated and signal successes against the formidable Afghans are conclusive evidence of their valour; they are patient of fatigue and privation, and, in case of reverse, readily rally. They are, however, as might be expected, prone to plunder,\\(^5\\) retaining this propensity (a very common one with oriental troops) from the time when Sikh and robber were synonymous words; and, though easily disciplined so far as relates to the accurate performance of military evolutions, they are also easily moved to mutiny. Malcolm gives rather a favourable view of their character. \"The Sikh soldier,\" he says, \"is, generally speaking, brave, active, and cheerful, without polish, but neither destitute of sincerity nor attachment.\" But for the occurrence of some recent events, the present race of Sikhs might have claimed exemption from the charge of cruelty. Their celebrated Maharaja, Runjeet Singh, rarely shed the blood either of criminals or of his personal enemies, and he appears to have aspired to the praise of clemency. The countries which have fallen under the Sikh sway have indeed in general decayed in wealth and population, but this is to be attributed rather to their rapacity than to their innate cruelty.\\(^6\\)\n\nIn person, the Sikhs bear a general resemblance to other people of Hindoo origin, but they are more robust, the result of a more varied and liberal diet: they especially excel others of the Hindoo race in having the lower extremities full, muscular, and symmetrical. Their women are esteemed beautiful, but they are frequently the victims of one of the most frightful of the enormities of Hindooism, which, banished from the British dominions in India, still lingers in unabated horror in a few\n\n---\n\n* A full account of the Sikh faith and \"ecclesiastical polity\" would be incompetent with the scope of this work. Ample information respecting them may be obtained from Wilson,\\(^1\\) Forster,\\(^2\\) Malcolm,\\(^3\\) Masson,\\(^4\\) and Ward.\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) As. Res. xvii. 231-239.\n\\(^2\\) Jour.

Nine of the wives and female slaves of the Maharaja, Runjeet Singh, met this cruel fate on his death, in 1839.\n\nThe general dress of the male portion of the Sikh population consists of a jacket and trowsers reaching to the knee; of late, the chiefs have lengthened the trowsers to the ankles. They also wear shawls and scarfs, and wrap their heads in thin narrow cloths, so as to form a rude turban. The favourite service of their soldiers is on horseback, using shields, swords, matchlocks, and spears, and some continue the use of the bow, for which they were formerly much celebrated. The irregular troops all serve on horseback, and are well suited for services in which such a force is required. The Sikhs are in general remarkably illiterate; Runjeet Singh was unable to read or write, and most of his courtiers were alike destitute of these elementary attainments. This may, perhaps, be accounted for from the fact of most of the sect, including Runjeet himself, tracing their origin to the Jets, a Rajpoot tribe of very low order.\n\nThe language of the Punjab is called by Malcolm a jargon compounded of various tongues. As spoken in large towns, it is a dialect of the Urdu or Hindustani. In the villages, the dialect in use is Jathky, sprung from a cognate root, and originally the language of the country. On the southern frontier, Punjabi contains a large admixture of Sindhi. There are two characters used, Laude, that of common translation, and Gurmukhi, or the character of the Granth. As before mentioned, there is also a dialect lately devised by the Sikhs, which enables them, while discoursing on the common business of life, to express their contempt for Mahometanism.\n\nThe present rule of the Sikhs extends over the whole of the Punjab, including Kashmir and the hill states of the north-east, comprehending Mundi, Kulu, and Kishtewar, in addition to Ladakh and Bulti. On the west of the Indus it comprises the provinces of Peshawer, and the Derajat, or Daman, with its dependencies, as far south as the frontier of Sinde. The revenue\n\n* \u0633\u0627\u062a\u06cc literally \"chaste;\" a virtuous wife according to Hindoo notions of virtue; a woman compelled to burn herself with her husband's body.\nof the government is generally estimated, in round numbers, at something more than two and a half crores of rupees, or two millions and a half of sterling, which is allocated as follows:\n\n| Kashmir | *3,400,000 |\n|---------|------------|\n| Peshawer | 1,000,000  |\n| Derajat and adjacent petty states | 1,500,000 |\n| Punjab | 19,100,000 |\n| Possessions of Maharaja on left bank of Sutlej | 750,000 |\n\n25,750,000\n\nor \u00a32,575,000.\n\nRunjeet Singh, the late Maharaja of the Punjab, was believed to have accumulated ten millions sterling of treasure and moveable property. This has been by native report exaggerated to thirty millions.\n\nThe military force was, in 1832, thus estimated:\n\n- Regular and disciplined by Europeans\n  - Cavalry: 12,811\n  - Infantry: 14,941\n- Undisciplined: 26,950\n- Contingents of chiefs: 27,312\n\nTotal: 82,014\n\n- Artillery\n  - Guns: 376\n  - Swivels mounted on camels: 370\n\nIn 1836, Runjeet himself stated to Von H\u00fcgel that his forces consisted of infantry, 27,000, of whom 15,000 were clad in armour; cavalry, 27,000; elephants, 100. Burnes states the army at 75,000, of whom 25,000 were regular infantry, 5,000 regular cavalry and artillery; and these being drilled in the European mode, were considered by this writer \"fully equal to the troops of the Indian army.\" The artillery, according to the same authority, comprised a hundred and fifty guns. On occasion, however, of the interview which took place in 1838, at Ferozpoor, between the British Governor-General (Lord Auckland) and the Maharaja, it was remarked of the Sikh army,\n\n* An enormous and almost incredible amount for a population of 200,000; but the ill-fated district is fast sinking into utter destitution and depopulation.\n\"that the whole force, compared with the European standard, was indifferently equipped, the cavalry poorly mounted, and the artillery ill-harnessed.\"\n\nThere are few main and much-beaten routes in the Punjab, probably because the navigable rivers, and the level and open character of the country, admit of so many natural and unprepared lines of communication. The main route eastward from Kabool enters the Punjab at Attock, and takes a direction generally south-east to Rawit Pindee, where it divides, one route proceeding to the left by Jailum, the other to the right to Jelalpoor, and subsequently to Ramnuggur. The Jailum route subdivides at that town, the left-hand branch proceeding by Vazeerabad to Amritsir, and beyond that city to Filor, where it crosses the Sutlej into British India; the other takes a more southerly direction, through Ramnuggur to Lahore and Ferozpoor, into the same territory.\n\nThe British army under Sir John Keane, and also that under General Pollock, returning from Afghanistan, pursued this route, except that for a short distance they took a collateral road a little farther to the right, thus avoiding Lahore, to prevent collision with the Sikh forces, and to calm the alarm of the Maharaja.\n\nAnother great route is that from Ferozpoor south-west to Mooltan, and thence into the Daman, west of the Indus. To the north-west of the route from Ferozpoor to Mooltan, and collateral and nearly parallel to it, a much-frequented route follows the course of the river Ravee. Three routes lead from Lahore, Amritsir, and the surrounding country, to Kashmir, one by Rihursi and the Banihal Pass, another by Bimber and the Pir Panjal Pass, a third by Punch and the Baramula Pass, by which pass there is also a frequented route from Attock. The route from the plain of the Punjab to Bultistan lies through Kashmir, leaving the valley by the Pass of Bundipur. The most frequented route to Ladakh lies also through Kashmir, which it leaves on the north-east by the Bultul Pass. There is another route to Ladakh by Lahoul and Rapstru. Cross routes and roads of less importance are numerous, but appear in general to be little better than neglected paths or tracts.\n\nThe Sikh realm has many considerable towns; of these, the most worthy of notice are\u2014Lahore, Amritsir, Kashmir, or Sirinagur; Mooltan, Peshawer, Dera Ghazee Khan, Dera Ismail Khan, Julinder, Vazeerabad, Leia, Nurpur, Lc, Jclum, Jelalpoor, Shoo-\njabad, and several others, especially noticed under their names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe Punjab was, in remote antiquity, the scene of some of Alexander's most arduous exploits. At the beginning of the tenth century of the Christian era, it was ravaged, widely and sweepingly, by Mahmood\\(^3\\) of Ghiznee, \"the Destroyer.\" Lahore, for about a century remained in possession of the successors of Mahmood, and was frequently the seat of their government, until 1186,\\(^4\\) when the Ghaznevide dynasty was uprooted by Mahomed, Sultan of Ghore. Subsequently to this event, the Punjab became the prey of a succession of weak, licentious, and turbulent rulers, among whom the Afghans generally predominated, until, in 1526,\\(^5\\) Baber gained the victory of Paniput, and, ascending the throne, established the sovereignty of the Timurian family. In 1748, Ahmed Shah Durani, finding the power of the Moguls broken by the invasion of Nadir Shah, overran the Punjab with an Afghan army, and made himself master of Lahore;\\(^6\\) and in 1756 the Mogul emperor of India ceded to him these conquests. Soon after this, the power of the Sikhs began to assume a formidable aspect, and in 1768\\(^7\\) they overran the country east of the Jailum, and, crossing that river, took the celebrated fortress, Rotas. In 1797\\(^8\\) Shah Zeman Durani invaded the Punjab and took Lahore, but being immediately recalled by an insurrection at home, left the country in greater confusion than he found it. The expulsion of Shah Shooja in 1809, and consequent subversion of the Afghan monarchy, facilitated the rise of Runjeet Singh, a Sikh of the caste of Jats, one of the humblest but most numerous among the Rajpoots. In 1799, this adventurer had obtained from Zeman Shah Durani a grant of Lahore,\\(^9\\) and in the same year\\(^1\\) succeeded in expelling three rival Sikh chieftains, who had maintained themselves there. In 1809, having extended his power over the greater part of the Punjab, and some of the petty hill states, he carried his arms across the Sutlej, and attacked the Sikh chieftains under British protection. Negotiations ensued, and were brought to an amicable conclusion by a treaty providing \"that the British government will have no concern with the territories and subjects of the Raja to the northward of the river Sutlej,\" and that Runjeet Singh would not commit or suffer any encroachment on the possessions or rights of the chiefs on the left bank of that river.\\(^2\\) In 1818, Runjeet\n\n---\n\n\\(^3\\) Ferishta, i. 47, 63; D'Hierbelot, ii. 518; Price, Mahommedan Hist. ii. 281-294.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ferishta, i. 159.\n\n\\(^5\\) Id. i. 598; Baber, Mem. 367.\n\n\\(^6\\) Elph.

In 1819, the Maharaja of the Sikhs, as Runjeet styled himself, conquered the Derajat, on the west side of the Indus, and Kashmir. In 1831, at Rooper, on the Sutlej, an interview took place, amidst great pomp and display, between Runjeet Singh and Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of British India, and a paper was placed in the hands of the Sikh ruler promising him the perpetual amity of the British government. In 1835, Gulab Singh, a vassal of the Maharaja, reduced to subjection the extensive hill state of Ladakh, or Middle Tibet, and five or six years later, the same chieftain subdued Bulti, or Little Tibet. In 1838 Runjeet Singh became a party in the tripartite treaty with the British government and Shah Shooja, and succeeded in obtaining a stipulation securing to him the right to all the territories which he then possessed on both sides of the Indus. Runjeet Singh died in July 1839, and was succeeded by his son Kuruck Singh. The latter died in 1840, and, as was generally believed, from the effects of poison. Before the funeral ceremonies for this prince were fully ended, his son and successor was killed by the falling of a beam\u2014a catastrophe not accidental, though intended to have the appearance of being so. A competition for the vacant throne then ensued between the widow of Kuruck Singh and a reputed son of Runjeet Singh, named Sheer Singh, but who, though born in wedlock, had been subjected by his alleged father to the stigma of illegitimacy. Sheer Singh finally succeeded, but his triumph was of short duration. Near the close of the year 1843 he was assassinated; and this was followed by a widely-spread, frantic, and sanguinary anarchy, which at this present time (1844) engages the anxious attention of the Anglo-Indian government.\n\nPUNJAN GOOSH'T, in Western Afghanistan, a range of mountains bounding the upper part of the valley of Furrah on the east. They are situate to the left of the route from Kandahar to Herat, and about two hundred and twenty miles northwest of the former town. They rise to a considerable height from the surrounding country, and as the latter is very elevated, their total altitude above the level of the sea is, probably, not less than 12,000 feet. Lat. 32\u00b0 30', long. 63\u00b0 5'.\n\nPUNJGOOR, in Beloochistan, a town of Mckran, the\nprincipal place of a petty district, also called Punjgoor, and containing ten small towns or villages. This little territory is a valley, and is one of the most productive places in Beloochistan, yielding in great abundance fine dates, grapes, grain, and esculent vegetables. Its fertility is owing to a never-failing supply of water from the river Boodoor or Dustee, which is replenished by a copious spring issuing from its bed about three miles above the town. The population is in general agricultural, and greatly superior in character and habits to the other Brahooic tribes of the neighbourhood. The chief, a relative of the Khan of Kelat, was formerly his vassal, but has lately made himself independent. The annual income of this petty potentate is believed not to exceed an amount equal to 2,000l. sterling. Lat. 27\u00b0 20', long. 62\u00b0 42'.\n\nPUNJNUD,* a great stream of the Punjab, discharges into the Indus the collected water of the Ghara and Trimab, and consequently of the Sutlej, Beas, Ravee, Chenaub, and Jailum. The great channel bearing the name of Punjnuud commences at the confluence of the Ghara and Trimab, in lat. 29\u00b0 21', long. 71\u00b0 6', and, taking a south-westerly course of about sixty miles, joins the Indus nearly opposite Mittunkote, and in lat. 28\u00b0 57', long. 70\u00b0 30'. Burnes describes the commencement of the Punjnuud, or confluence of the Trimab and Ghara, as \"formed without violence, and the low banks of both rivers lead to constant alteration in the point of the union, which but a year ago was two miles higher up. This circumstance renders it difficult to decide on the relative size of these rivers at their junction; both are about five hundred yards wide, but the Chenaub (Trimab) is more rapid. Immediately below the confluence the united stream exceeds eight hundred yards; but in its course to the Indus, though it expands sometimes to a greater size, the Chenaub rarely widens to six hundred yards. In this part of its course it is likewise subject to change. The depth is greatest near its confluence with the Indus, exceeding twenty feet; but it decreases in ascending the river to about fifteen. The current is swifter than the Indus, running at the rate of three and a half miles an hour. The Chenaub (Punjnuud) has some sand-banks, but they do not interrupt its navigation by the 'zohruks,' or flat-bottomed boats.\" Wade\n\n* From '\u067e\u0646\u062c' \"five,\" and '\u0646\u0647\u0631' \"river.\"\nfound the Punjnud, abreast of Ooch, about nine hundred yards wide at the season of low water, and mentions that during the rains it is sometimes six miles across from that town to the opposite side. The Punjnud is by all accounts a very fine stream. It is navigated by large flat-bottomed boats without keels, but with perpendicular sides, which prevent them from making much leeway, even with the wind on the beam. The confluence of the Punjnud with the Indus takes place without noise or violence, in consequence of the low, soft nature of the banks admitting of a considerable expansion of the channel there. An eddy sets to the opposite side, and depresses the surface of the water there below the general level, without, however, producing danger or serious impediment to navigation. Burnes observes, that the name Punjnud appears to be a European refinement, and is unknown to the people living on its banks, and that this great stream is called Chenaub by the natives. The contrary, however, appears intimated by Boileau, who states unambiguously that not one of the rivers of the Punjab retains its original name after falling in with another of nearly the same size, and adds explicitly, that after the junction of the Ghara with the Trimab, the united stream bears the name of Punjnud.\n\nPUNJOOK, in Beloochistan, a village of Cutch Gundava, on the route from Gundava to Larkhana, and ten miles south of the former town. Lat. 28\u00b0 20', long. 67\u00b0 33'.\n\nPUNJSHIR, generally but corruptly called Panchshir, a river in Afghanistan, rises on the south-eastern declivity of the Khawak Pass, in lat. 35\u00b0 40', long. 69\u00b0 50', and at an elevation above the sea of 13,200 feet. It holds its course in a south-westerly direction for about eighty miles, through the whole length of the valley of Punjshir, and, in lat. 35\u00b0, long. 69\u00b0 15', receives the Ghorband river. It then takes a south-easterly direction for about thirty-five miles, and receives the stream flowing westward from Koh Damun, and, proceeding from that confluence southwards for a farther distance of about twenty, falls into the Kabool river in lat. 34\u00b0 38', long. 69\u00b0 47'.\n\nPUNNA, in Afghanistan, a village on the route by the Golairee Pass from Dera Ismael Khan to Ghuznee, and twenty-five miles south of the latter place. The road in this part of the route is good, and there is a supply of water from a subterraneous aqueduct. Lat. 33\u00b0 7', long. 68\u00b0 10'.\nPUNNAILAH, properly PUNIALLA, in Afghanistan, a village of the Daman, on the route from Dera-Ismail Khan to Kala Bagh, and thirty-five miles north of the former town. Though situate at the southern entrance of the valley of Largee, a singularly barren and dreary tract, the immediate neighbourhood of the village is described by Elphinstone as \"a cheerful and beautiful spot, such as one would figure a scene in Arabia Felix. It is a sandy valley, bounded by craggy hills, watered by a little stream, and interspersed with clumps of date-trees and with patches of green corn. The village itself stood in a deep grove of date-trees, on the side of a hill, from which many streams gushed through little caverns in the thickest part of the wood.\" The inhabitants are a mixed race of Belooche and Arab descent, and of notoriously predatory character. Lat. 32\u00b0 15', long. 70\u00b0 58'.\n\nPURANI DERIA, a minor branch of the Indus.\u2014See NARRA, EASTERN.\n\nPUREAN, in Afghanistan, a village in the Punjshir valley, near the route from the Khawak Pass to Kabul, and about fifteen miles south-east of the crest of the pass. It is situate on a small feeder of the Punjshir river, and at a great elevation, as it lies on the mountain side above the fort of Khawak, which is 9,300 feet above the sea. Purean is in lat. 35\u00b0 32', long. 70\u00b0.\n\nPURWAN, in Afghanistan, a village in a valley of the same name, which furrows the southern side of Hindoo Koosh, in lat. 35\u00b0 10', long. 69\u00b0 12'. The valley is very tortuous, and is in one part a narrow rocky defile; in another it is of softer character, the sides rising in terraces planted with mulberry-trees, the fruit of which, dried and ground, forms the staple subsistence of the inhabitants. A small river flows down the valley, and joins the Punchshir. Two passes proceed from this valley to Turkestan\u2014that of Purwan Proper, and that of Sir-i-Ulung. The summits of both are probably very lofty, as a British party found them impassable from snow in the beginning of November; though those travellers, a few days later, succeeded in surmounting the pass of Hageguk, the summit of which is 12,000 feet above the level of the sea. Purwan acquired some celebrity during the military operations in Afghanistan. Here, in November 1840, a British force attacked a party of Afghans, with the view of capturing Dost Mahomed Khan, but two squadrons of the\n2nd Bengal Native Cavalry, when ordered to charge, instead of responding to the command, fled in the most dastardly manner, deserting their officers; on this unhappy occasion, Dr. Lord, political agent, Lieut. Broadfoot, and Adjutant Crispin, were killed, and the remaining officers severely wounded.* Notwithstanding this event, Dost Mahomed immediately repaired to Kabool, and surrendered himself to the British envoy. Purwan is in lat. $35^\\circ 9'$, long. $69^\\circ 16'$.\n\nPURWANA, in Khorasan, a village on the route from Herat to Merve, and eleven miles north of the former town. It is situate in a valley of considerable elevation, as the road from Herat ascends for the whole distance.

The soil and climate are considered peculiarly favourable to the perfection of the breed of horses, and, in consequence, there is a great and well-selected stud belonging to the Sikh government. The town, which was founded in the reign of Akbar, is well built of bricks, and the streets are paved with the same material. Population about 5,000. Lat. $31^\\circ 17'$, long. $74^\\circ 45'$.\n\nPUTTEHPOOR, in Sinde, a village on the route from Sehwan to Larkhana, and thirty-two miles north of the former town.

It is distant forty miles west of the former town, and is a small place containing about forty mud huts; there is a good supply of water from a stream, which here divides into two branches, one going to Dajel, the other to Sang Ghar. There is a road practicable for wheel-carriages from Raknee to Kandahar. Lat. 30\u00b0 4', long. 70\u00b0.\n\nRAMNAGUR, in the Punjab, on the route from Chumba to Kashmir, by the Banihal Pass, is a considerable town with a large and stately castle, the residence of the deposed raja, and another the stronghold of the Sikh chief, his successor. It is one of the few\nplaces the condition of which has been ameliorated under Sikh dominion, having, since its acquisition by Suchet Singh, the present chieftain, been improved by the building of a large bazaar and several streets. Much encouragement is given to new settlers, and, in consequence, the population consists of various races\u2014Sikh, Hindoo, Afghan, Kashmirian, and Persian. Lat. $32^\\circ 38'$, long. $75^\\circ 13'$:\n\nRAMNEGHUR,\\(^1\\) or RAMNUGGUR, in the Punjab, a walled town close to the left or east bank of the Chenaub, stands on a spacious plain, where, during the reign of Runjeet Singh, the Sikh troops frequently mustered for campaigns to the westward. There is a ferry here across the Chenaub, which, at its lowest season, was found to be three hundred yards wide, and for the most part nine feet deep, running at the rate of a mile and a half an hour. Two miles below the town there is, however, a ford, where the depth does not exceed three feet when the water is low. This place was called Rasulnuggur, or \"prophet's town,\" until stormed in 1778 by Maha Singh, the father of Runjeet, when it received the present name,\\(^2\\) signifying the \"town of God.\" Lat. $32^\\circ 20'$, long. $73^\\circ 38'$.\n\nRAMTERETH, in the Punjab, a village situate on the route from Amritsir to Vazeerabad, ten miles north-west of the former town.

Viewed from the east, it appears like an island, in consequence of the lowness of the land constituting the isthmus connecting it with the continent. The bay on the east side has safe ground, having regular depths of six or seven fathoms, decreasing...\nto three and four fathoms near the shore. A supply of water may be obtained from a rivulet called Jerkamutty, a little to the eastward. The bay on the west side has shoal water, and is destitute of shelter from south and west winds.

The shore in this part is bold and safe to approach, a bank extending southward for about four leagues, with a depth of twenty or twenty-five fathoms, and then deepening, so that soundings cannot be obtained. Lat. $25^\\circ 19'$, long. $65^\\circ 9'$.\n\nRAS MOOARREE, at the north-western extremity of the coast of Sinde, a headland, also called Monze Cape (which see).\n\nRAS NOO.\u2014See Gwadel Cape.\n\nRAS PASSEENOE.\u2014See Passeeno.\n\nRAS PISHK, in Beloochistan, a headland projecting a short distance south-east into the Arabian Sea. It forms the western side of the bay, of which Ras Noo or Gwadel Point forms the eastern. This bay, measuring about three leagues from east to west, and the same distance from north to south, has regular soundings of seven or eight fathoms at the entrance, and five or six inside, with a mud bottom, and is sheltered from all winds, except those blowing between east and south-south-west.

The source is situate about lat. $32^\\circ 30'$, long. $76^\\circ$. At the distance of about forty miles from the source, in a\n\n\u00b9 Jour. As. Soc., Beng. 1841, p. 100, Broome and Cunningham on Sources of Punjab Rivers.\nsouth-westerly direction, the Ravee is joined by two feeders, the Nye and the Boodhill, the latter taking its rise in a lake called Munee Muhees, regarded as sacred by the superstitious Hindoos.* Where surveyed by Cunningham, four or five miles from Burma-wur, at an elevation of about 7,000 feet, and in lat. 32\u00b0 30', long. 76\u00b0 30', it was found one hundred and sixteen feet wide. At Chumba, about sixty miles below and south-west of this place, or a hundred miles from its source, according to the statement of Vigne, the Ravee is crossed by a bridge. Forster states that it is there \"forty or fifty yards broad, and fordable at most seasons of the year.\" At Bisuli, to which the downward course is about twenty-five miles due west, Forster found it, early in April, about a hundred and twenty yards wide, very rapid, and unfordable. The statement of Vigne is less explicit. \"I have been twice ferried over the Ravi at Bisuli, once during the rainy season, when it was swelled to a roaring torrent, and once again in winter, when its stream was far more tranquil. On both occasions the natives made the passage upon buffalo hides. Its width is about eighty yards.\" From Bisuli, in lat. 32\u00b0 25', long. 75\u00b0 28', the Ravee takes a south-westerly direction, which it generally holds for the rest of its course. Macartney found it, at Meanee ferry, on the route from Amritsir to Vazeerabad, and about two hundred and twenty miles from its source, to have, at the beginning of August and at the time of fullest water, a breadth of five hundred and thirteen yards, and a depth of twelve feet, where greatest. The deep channel was between thirty and forty feet in breadth, the rest of the waterway having a depth of from three to five feet. In the cold season, when lowest, the water is in no part more than four feet deep. Moorcroft describes it at Lahore, about twenty-five miles lower down, as divided into three different streams or branches. These, he states, are \"separated, in the dry weather, by intervals of half a mile, but in the rainy season the two most easterly branches\u2020 are\n\n* Vigne considers the Boodhill river, flowing from the Munee Muhees, or Muni Mys, as the real Ravee, but the evidence of Cunningham, who approached nearer the locality, merits more credit.\n\n\u2020 Moorcroft appears in error in stating the eastern branches of the Ravee to be the principal, as all other accounts represent the western as the main stream. There can be no doubt that he is in error in stating that Shahdehra, the burial-place of Jehanjir, is on the left bank of the Ravee, as Masson, Burnes, and Jacquemont agree that it is on the right or west bank.\nunited, and form an expansive and rapid stream.\u201d \u201cThe two first branches are fordable, but the third, which is the principal one, has a ferry.\u201d He remarks, that the boats on the Ravee were the largest and best-built that he has seen in India. Burnes, who navigated the Ravee from its confluence with the Chenaub to Lahore, says it \u201cis very small, and resembles a canal, rarely exceeding a hundred and fifty yards in breadth in any part of its course. Its banks are precipitous, so that it deepens before it expands. Nothing can exceed the crookedness of its course, which is a great impediment to navigation, for we often found ourselves, after half a day\u2019s sail, within two miles of the spot from which we started. The water of the Ravee is redder than that of the Chenaub. It is fordable in most places for eight months in the year.\u201d From Lahore, its course south-west, measured according to the main direction of the stream, to its confluence with the Chenaub, is about two hundred miles, but along all the sinuosities, three hundred and eighty. This point is in lat. $30^\\circ 33'$, long. $71^\\circ 46'$. The Ravee joins the Chenaub by three mouths close to each other. Its total length, measured along the main direction of its course, is about four hundred and fifty miles.* It is considered to be the Hydraotes mentioned by Rennell, Arrian, and the Iravati of Sanscrit authorities: it is still known by the name of the Iraotee, which might easily be corrupted by the Greeks into that which they appear to have given it.\n\nRAWDON, in Sinde, a group of three or four villages on the route from Sehwan to Larkhana, and eleven miles north of the former town. It is situate close to a watercourse sent off from the Indus on the right side, and is two miles from the main channel. The road in this part of the route is level, and in general good, except that it is cut up in some places by channels formed for irrigation. The adjacent country is fertile and well cultivated. Lat. $26^\\circ 30'$, long. $67^\\circ 55'$.\n\nRAWIL PINDE, in the Punjab, between the Indus and the Jailum. It is a large, populous town, consisting of mud houses with flat roofs. It contains, what is called a palace, a wretched building of brick, constructed by Shan Soojah, on his expulsion from Kabool. There is a large bazaar, and a considerable business in the transit trade between Hindostan and Afghanistan.\n\n* The estimate of Macartney is less, being only four hundred and fifteen miles, but he did not know the exact locality of its source.\nThe town is surrounded by a wall with bastions, and has an old fort, on which a few miserable cannon are mounted. Lat. $33^\\circ 40'$, long. $73^\\circ$.\n\nREEPREE, in the Punjab, a village situate on the right bank of the Trimab, about twenty miles from its confluence with the Ghara. Lat. $29^\\circ 33'$, long. $71^\\circ 6'$.\n\nREGAN, in Beloochistan, a village on the route from Nooshky to Bunpoor, and a hundred and eighty miles south-west of the former place. It is situate on the Badoor river, or torrent, the current of which intermits during great part of the year, and water can then only be obtained by digging in the bed. When visited by Pottinger, it was deserted, the inhabitants having emigrated in consequence of famine. Lat. $28^\\circ 20'$, long. $62^\\circ 39'$.\n\nREG ROWAN,* (\"Flowing Sand,\") in the Kohistan of Kabool, is a bed of loose sand on the slope of a hill. When put in motion by the wind or by the trampling of feet, undulations are caused, which produce a sound, described by Wood to be like that of a distant drum, mellowed by softer music. Close to it is a deep and unexplored cave, viewed with much awe by the Mahometans, who believe that their expected Imam Medi, the supposed precursor of the end of the world, has his retreat there until the appointed time of his appearance.\n\nThe bed of sand is a hundred yards wide, and it stretches up the face of the rock for two hundred and fifty yards with an acclivity of about $45^\\circ$. The appearance of the sand is very curious, as if the hill on the side of which it lies had been cut in two, and that it had gushed out; but probably it has been accumulated by an eddy of the wind, which is here very powerful and constant.\n\nThe singular effects manifested at Reg Rowan did not escape the observant Baber, who thus alludes to them:\u2014\"They say that in the summer season the sound of drums and nagarets (Tartar drums) issue from this sand.\"\u2020 It is difficult to offer a satisfac-\n\n* From \u0631\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0646 \"sand,\" and \u0631\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0646 \"flowing.\"\n\n\u2020 Lieut. Newbold describes a similar phenomenon at Gebel Nakus, on the eastern shore of the Red Sea, but he is unquestionably mistaken in his belief that such nowhere else occurs. Welsted, who calls this place Djibbel Narkono, gives the following full and interesting account of his visit to it:\u2014\"The Djibbel Narkono, or sounding mountain, concerning which there has been so much doubt and discussion in Europe. I visited it on my way here\u2014it is situated on the sea-shore, about eight miles from Tor. A solid slope of the finest drift sand extends on the sea face from the base to\ntory explanation of that which is so unusual and has been so little considered. Prinsep advances the opinion, that \"the effect is produced merely by a reduplication of impulse setting air in vibration in a focus of echo.\" Reg Rowan is in lat. $35^\\circ$, long. $69^\\circ 10'$.\n\nREJLA, in Sinde, a village situate on the right bank of the Indus, five miles west of the city of Hyderabad.

Though now nearly filled up, it was at a former period one of the principal mouths of that river, and being frequented by snipping, was marked out by a munorah, or minaret, now fallen. In consequence of this distinction, the spot still bears the name Munorah. Lat. $24^\\circ 10'$, long. $67^\\circ 22'$.\n\nthe summit, about six hundred feet, at an angle of about $40^\\circ$ with the horizon. This is encircled, or rather semicircled, if the term is allowable, by a ridge of sandstone rocks, rising up in the pointed pinnacle, and presenting little surface adapted for forming an echo. It is remarkable that there are several other slopes similar to this, but the sounding or rumbling, as it has been called, is confined to this alone. We dismounted from our camels, and remained at the base while a Bedouin scrambled up. We did not hear the sound until he had attained a considerable height. The sound then began rolling down, and it commenced in a strain resembling the first faint notes of an Aeolian harp, or the fingers wetted and drawn over glass, increasing in loudness as the sand reached the base, when it was almost equal to thunder. It caused the rock on which we were seated to vibrate, and our frightened camels (animals, you know, not easily alarmed) to start off. I was perfectly astonished, as was the rest of the party. I had visited it before in the winter months, but the sound was then so faint as to be barely evident; but now the scorching heat of the sun had dried the sand, and permitted it to roll down in large quantities. I cannot now form the most remote conjecture as to the cause of it. We must not, I find, now refer it to the sand falling into a hollow: that might produce a sound, but could never cause the prolonged vibrations, as it were, of some huge harp-string. I shall not venture on any speculation, but having carefully noted the facts, I shall lay them, on my arrival in England, before some wiser head than my own, and see if he can make anything out of them.\"\nRIHURSI, in the Punjab, a town situate near the left or east bank of the Chenaub, and on the southern slope of the most southern of the Himalaya ranges. Here is a fort considered by Vigne \"one of the strongest, perhaps the strongest, and best constructed in the country.\" It is situated on a conical and rocky eminence south of the town, and is nearly square. The walls are built of stone: they are very lofty, and are rendered still more difficult to be scaled by their rising immediately from the precipitous sides of the hill, which are steeply scarped. There is a tower at each angle, and no pains have been spared to render these, as well as most of the buildings of the interior, bomb-proof. The garrison is supplied with water by means of two large tanks within the walls. The fort is separated, by a deep ravine, from an eminence of sandstone of the same height, about a mile distant. The town itself is an inconsiderable place, having about a thousand inhabitants. It belongs to Golab Singh, the Sikh chief of Jamu. Lat. $32^\\circ 51'$, long. $74^\\circ 50'$.\n\nRILU, in the north-east of the Punjab, a small town situate among the mountains forming the lower ranges in the southern part of the Himalaya. It has a neat bazaar, and a fort with rampart, curtains, and bastions. Lat. $32^\\circ 5'$, long. $76^\\circ 2'$.\n\nRIMBIARA RIVER, in Kashmir, rises on the north-eastern declivity of the Pir Panjal, and holding a north-easterly course of about forty miles, falls into the Veshau Behut, or Jailum, in lat. $33^\\circ 48'$, long. $74^\\circ 57'$. It is frequently called the river of Shupeyon from flowing by the town of that name.\n\nRINDAN, in Sinde, a village on the route from Sehwan to Larkhana, and fifteen miles north of the former town. It is situate in a fine grove close to the right bank of the Indus. Lat. $26^\\circ 33'$, long. $67^\\circ 53'$.\n\nROBAT, in Afghanistan, a halting-place on the route from Furrah to Giriskh, and twenty miles east of the former town. Lat. $32^\\circ 20'$, long. $62^\\circ 26'$.\n\nRODA, in Sinde, a village situate on the right bank of the Indus. Lat. $28^\\circ 2'$, long. $69^\\circ 2'$.\n\nROD BAHAR, in Beloochistan, a valley through which the route lies from Kelat to Beebee Nance, in the Bolan Pass. Its name, signifying \"river of spring,\"* has probably been given in\n\n* \u0631\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631.\nallusion to its fertility, pleasant aspect, and abundant irrigation. It extends for about eighteen miles in length, in a direction nearly from north-east to south-west, between lat. $29^\\circ 22'$\u2014$29^\\circ 36'$, long. $66^\\circ 56'$\u2014$67^\\circ 8'$. Lying on the route between Beebec Nanec, having an elevation of 1,695 feet, and Kelat, having an elevation of 6,000, it can scarcely be less than 2,000 feet high, and is probably much more, as the inhabitants emigrate in winter with their flocks and herds to the low warm tract of Cutch Gundava. Rod Bahar is, throughout its whole length, supplied with water from the stream, which, flowing down the bottom of the valley, joins the Bolan river at Beebee Nanee. The soil is cultivated in patch\u00e9s with rice, wheat, millet, and esculent vegetables; orchards of mulberries, peaches, and apricots, yield abundance of fine fruit; and the inclosing mountains pasture numerous herds of goats and flocks of sheep. The annual migration of the inhabitants and their live stock takes place in November, and they previously bury their grain so artfully as to escape discovery until their return in the succeeding March. The ground produces two crops, of which wheat and millet are sown in August, and reaped in the beginning of April; rice is sown in the middle of May, and reaped in the middle of September. The route from Beebec Nanee to Kelat, passing through the valley, admits the passage of horses and beasts of burthen, but much labour and skill would be required to render it practicable for wheel-carriages.\n\nRODBAR, near the south-eastern border of Seistan, a village situate on the left bank of the Helmund, which, though four hundred yards wide, rapid, and in general deep, is fordable near this place. It is held by the Towkee tribe of Belooches. Lat. $30^\\circ 30'$, long. $62^\\circ 33'$.\n\nROGALIN, in Sinde, a village close to the north-west frontier, on the route from Shikarpoor to Gundava, and twenty-five miles north-west of the former town. Lat. $28^\\circ 14'$, long. $68^\\circ 26'$.\n\nROGANI, in Beloochistan, a pass south of, and collateral with, the Kojuck Pass. It proceeds along the course of the Lora river, and through it lies the principal line of communication between the valley of Pishecn and Shorawuk, to the west of it. Lat. $30^\\circ 30'$, long. $66^\\circ 20'$.\n\nROGHAN, in Sinde, a village near the frontier of Cutch.\nGundava, on the edge of the Put, or \"arid desert,\" and on the great route from Shikarpoor to Afghanistan. It is represented as a poor place, capable of furnishing some forage, but few or no supplies for human subsistence. There are several wells, but the water is stated to be of bad quality. Lat. 28\u00b0 13', long. 68\u00b0 26'.\n\nROH, in Afghanistan, a village on the route from Saugad to Raknee, and twelve miles north-west of the former place.

Lat. 32\u00b0 41', long. 71\u00b0 32'.\n\nROKUN, in Sinde, a village on the route from Schwan to Larkhana, and thirty-three miles north of the former town. It is of considerable size, and is situate on the right bank of the Indus. Lat. 26\u00b0 48', long. 67\u00b0 53'.\n\nRONDU, or ROYAL, a small state or raj, dependent on Bulti, and situate on the right bank of the Indus, about forty miles north-west of Iskardoh. The communication along the right bank of the river, between Iskardoh and Rondu, is by means of a path not passable on horseback. The mountains abound in rock crystal and asphaltum. The raja, a vassal of the ruler of Bultistan, resides in a small fort.

It is a rapid stream, fifteen or twenty yards wide, crossing the route from Herat to Kandahar, fifty miles south of the latter place, in lat. 30\u00b0 36', long. 62\u00b0 14'.\n\nROODINJO, in Beloochistan, a village on the route from Kelat to Belah, and twenty miles south of the former town. It is a poor place, having only about thirty houses, the inhabitants of which migrate in winter to the warm plain of Cutch Gundava. The vicinity of the village is barren and desolate, and the only circumstance rendering it of any importance is an abundant and excellent supply of fine water from a stream flowing close to it. Its elevation above the sea is about 5,800 feet, and the cold is very severe in winter. Connected with this circumstance is the tradition of a fact stated by Pottinger to have given rise to the name of the town. \"Two merchants having accidentally\n\n* Pottinger, however, with less probability, states, that \"the people have Belooch. no water except in wells, and that neither good nor plentiful.\"\nmet here on an extreme cold winter's night, the camels of one of them being laden with madder, and of the other with indigo\u2014which two dyes are severally called in the Belooche language roden and jo\u2014the merchant whose camels bore the latter exchanged some of that valuable article, to a great disadvantage, for a quantity of the former, with which he made a fire, and thereby preserved his life; while his more parsimonious fellow-sufferer would not apply the smallest particle of his remaining merchandise to the same purpose, and perished from cold.\" Roodinjo is in lat. 28\u00b0 40', long. 66\u00b0 22'.\n\nROOKENWALA, in the Punjab, a village on the route from Ferozpoor to Mooltan, and sixty miles south-west of the former town.

It is situate in a plain cultivated in several parts, and intersected by a watercourse, at all times yielding a good supply. Water is also to be obtained from three wells in the village. Lat. 26\u00b0 13', long. 67\u00b0 50'.\n\nROREE, or LOHUREE\u00b9 (the ancient Lohurkot), in Sinde, a town situate on the eastern bank of the Indus, on a rocky eminence of limestone, interspersed with flint. This is one of those hills constituting a low range, of recent formation, stretching from Cutch Gundava\u00b2 into Upper Sinde, and continued there by numerous knolls and peaks, sometimes nearly isolated, through part of which the Indus finds its way at Roree. The rocky site of Roree is terminated abruptly on the western side by a precipice of forty feet high, rising from the beach of the Indus, which, in inundation, attains a height of about sixteen feet above its lowest level. Westmacott is of opinion that it formerly must have risen to fifty feet, washing the brow of the eminence on which Roree stands, and that then the neighbouring rocky islets in the Indus\n\n\u00b9 Westmacott, Jour.

According to the unanimous testimony of the natives, the level of the river during inundation continually decreases, and this is probably owing more to the wearing down of the rocky bed, than to any diminution of the supply of water in the upper part of the river's course.\n\nOf the three islets in the Indus abreast of the town, the most important is that of Bukkur, a large oval rock of flint and limestone, rising twenty-five feet above the river, and crowned by the celebrated fortress of the same name. The road from the town to the ferry, communicating with Bukkur and the western bank, is for some distance excavated in the face of the rock. On the western side of the Indus, and opposite Roree, is the decayed, though once rich and populous, town of Sukkur. Of the two islets above Bukkur, the nearer is separated from it by a channel easily fordable when the river is low. One is covered with date-palms, the other with numerous tombs surmounted with spires of glazed porcelain. The bold and lofty banks, covered with groves and rich vegetation, the picturesque islets, the great fort of Bukkur, the antique towns of Roree and Sukkur, and the vast river, form a scene scarcely anywhere surpassed in grandeur and beauty.\n\nRoree, when seen from without, has a striking and pleasing appearance, as the houses are four or five stories high, and of corresponding extent; but when surveyed more closely, they are found to be ruinous, in many instances rudely constructed with a slight timber-frame, filled up with wicker-work, and plastered with mud; and as whitewash, though very easily obtainable, is not used, they have a dingy and neglected appearance. The roofs are flat, and covered with straw, over which a layer of clay is placed, and they generally last twenty years or more, as they are exposed to little wet; but rain, when it does fall, causes great destruction amongst these frail buildings. The few more costly houses of burned brick were erected by wealthy merchants before the establishment of the dynasty of the late ameers, and are now generally unoccupied, oppression having either driven away the rich or reduced them to indigence. The flat roofs of the houses are surrounded by balustrades, and there the inhabitants spend much of their time in fine weather. The windows are not glazed, but those of the more wealthy inhabitants have shutters and lattices of wood. There are no chim-\nneys; the apartments are in consequence stained with smoke, and indeed they are generally very dirty. The streets are so narrow that a camel in passing occupies the entire breadth from side to side. The air, in consequence, is very close and unwholesome, and this evil is increased by filth being allowed to accumulate, in great dunghills, in the open places of the town. Numbers of loathsome-looking, diseased, and famished dogs haunt the city, and are its only scavengers. There are forty mosques, in which prayers are still recited, and twice that number in a state of ruin and desolation. The great mosque stands on an elevated site in the northeast part of the town, and was built at the commencement of the seventeenth century by the lieutenant of the Emperor Acbar. It is a massive, gloomy pile of red brick, covered with three domes, and coated with glazed porcelain tiles. In an adjacent shrine is kept a hair in amber, in a gold case set with rubies and emeralds, and inclosed in another of wood enriched with silver. This the pious Mahometan undoubtingly believes to be a hair of the beard of his prophet, and a number of guardians of this precious relic are supported at the public expense.\n\nRoree has a spacious and well-built serai, or lodging-place for travellers, but it has been allowed to fall into great decay. There are two bazaars, one for grain, the other for miscellaneous articles, and both are tolerably well supplied, but they are ill-built and ruinous. Manufactures are few and unimportant. They embrace the fabrication of paper of indifferent quality, leather, silks, and cottons, and the dyeing and printing of the last-named article. The population is mixed, consisting of Hindoos, indigenous Sindians, Belooches, Afghans, and Moguls, almost universally in a state of miserable poverty, and living in a very wretched manner. All trades and handicrafts, with the exception of works in gold, silver, and jewellery, are in the hands exclusively of Mahometans; the Hindoos devote themselves chiefly to banking, money-brokering, and similar traffic. The population is estimated at about 8,000.

Bokh. ii. 309; Elph. Acc. of Cambul, 80; Ferishta, iii. 116.\nwhich the fort stands. The western face of the plateau is washed by the small river Gham running at its base. Its works are of immense strength, consisting of massive walls of stone thirty feet thick, cemented with mortar, and strengthened with bastions, all crenated throughout, and provided with a double row of loopholes. Connected with the fortress is an immense well, lined with masonry, and having passages down to the water so numerous that from fifty to a hundred persons may draw water at once.\n\nThe present fortress was built about the year 1540, by Sheher Shah, the Patan Emperor of Dehly, who had driven Humaioon into exile, and he is said to have expended a million and a half sterling in its construction. When Humaioon returned, at the head of an army, to reclaim his empire, the fortress was given up to him without resistance. He demolished the palace raised within the fort by his rival and enemy, but found the massive defences too strong for the limited time and means which he could allow for their destruction. The fortress is at present in a ruinous state, and in one place a huge mass of the wall has tumbled down the precipice, and rendered the interior accessible. It is considered by military men indefensible against modern modes of attack.

It cost a sum exceeding 100,000l., but it has never been occupied, as it has no regular supply of water, this all-important point having never, until after the completion of the structure, entered into the thoughts of the Ameers of Sinde, under whose orders the work was executed.* It is built of stone and lime-mortar, in the form of an irregular pentagon, and can contain two thousand men.

Its mean elevation is 16,000 feet. The climate is characterized by great aridity, and from this cause, and the intense cold, is peculiarly suited to the constitution of the yak and shawl-goat, which thrive here, notwithstanding the scantiness of pasture.

During the swell it is watered by a branch of the Indus, but suffers much from want of water at other times. There is here a magnificent mosque of great size and height. The town was formerly much more considerable than at present; its population is now scarcely 1,000. Near the town is a tank of good water.

It was built by the celebrated but ill-fated Futteh Khan, as a residence for his mother, who maintained a petty court here, and was \"renowned,\" says Conolly, \"for courage and goodness.\" The fort is strong and well constructed, being surrounded by a dry ditch, formidable from its section and the very hard granite in which it is excavated. The form of the fort is oblong; it is a hundred and eighty yards in length, forty in width; with round towers at the angles and sides. The entire space inclosed by the ditch is three hundred yards long and two hundred wide, the ground between the ditch and the walls being intended to protect cattle from an enemy. The supply of water is abundant, from subterraneous aqueducts, and in the vicinity is considerable cultivation.

Lat. $32^\\circ 56'$, long. $67^\\circ 50'$.\nSAIYADABAD, in Afghanistan, a dilapidated fortress situate in the valley of Bamian, and close to the western side of the ruined city of Galgula. It is a huge, massive structure, originally of great strength, built of burnt bricks of extraordinary size. The entrance was formerly through a gateway of large dimensions on the western side, but this has been long built up, and admission to the interior is now gained by one much smaller on the south. The inmates live in rows of houses of two stories, each story being about twenty-five feet high. These rows are ranged along the inside of the ramparts, so that a small area is left in the middle of the inclosure. All the houses exhibit traces of having formerly been covered with domes of mud, but these have fallen in from the ravages of time, and the roofs are now flat, and supported on rafters. Water is at present obtained from a well, but there is a tradition that it formerly was supplied by subterraneous aqueducts, the situation of which being disclosed to a besieger by the daughter of a king who once held the place, its capture was the consequence. Hence it is called by the natives Killa Dokhtar, \"daughter's castle.\"\n\nMasson supposes that Saiyadabad formed part of the ill-fated city of Gulgula, and consequently fell with it before the arms of Zingis Khan. In the early part of the present century the fort was repaired and rendered defensible, and its owner, confiding in its impregnability, acted as if independent of the ruler of Kabool. Being made prisoner, he was under the necessity of surrendering the place to the wily Haji Khan Khaka, so notorious for his tortuous and treacherous policy during the occupation of Kabool by the British. Connected with the fortress, and in the same architectural style, are the massive ruins of a mosque, from which circumstance Masson concludes that this stronghold was constructed by Mussulmans. Saiyadabad is in lat. $34^\\circ 50'$, long. $67^\\circ 50'$.\n\nSAIYADWALA, in the Punjab, a considerable walled town, situate near the right or western bank of the Ravi.

It is often devoid of water, which has to be brought from a spring in the mountains five miles distant. It gives name to a celebrated pass on the route from Dera Ghazee Khan to Kandahar. The pass commences four miles west of the village, by a steep descent into a ravine, the bottom of which is covered with loose stones. The road is commanded by the steep heights on each side, and is little frequented on account of the depredations of the Marree freebooters holding the neighbouring hills.

The route by this pass proceeds northward up a gorge, which, at its southern extremity, opens into the Ghorbund valley, near the eastern entrance. The pass is practicable for horses during the summer months, but Wood found it impassable, from snow and excessive cold, as early as the beginning of November, and his Hindoo followers narrowly escaped perishing. The hamlet of Sir Ulung gives name to the pass, which is situate in lat. $35^\\circ 37'$, long. $68^\\circ 55'$.\n\nSALT RANGE. \u2014 An extensive group of mountains stretching generally, in lat. $32^\\circ 30'$\u2014$33^\\circ 30'$, in a direction from west to east, from the eastern base of the Suliman mountains, in Afghanistan, to the river Jailum, in the Punjab. This range is, in different parts, known to the natives under various denominations, but is by Europeans comprehended under the general term Salt Range, in consequence of the great extent and thickness of the beds of common salt which it in many places contains. Though the southern part of this group terminates rather abruptly at the west bank of the Jailum, the more northern part is, according to Jameson, connected with the recent formation constituting the lowest and most southern range of the Himalaya, and runs \"on by Bimber, Jummoo, Nurpoor, and down by the south of Belaspoor, crossing the Jumna at Fyzabad, and the Ganges at Hurdwar.\" The general direction of the range is from north-west to south-east.\n\nThis extensive range, of recent formation, may consequently be considered to contain not only the saliferous deposits of Kala-Bagh and Pind Dadun Khan, but also those of Mundi, in the northeast of the Punjab. Its geological conformation has been examined on the west bank of the Jailum, at Pind Dadun Khan and Jelalpoor, and there found to comprise the following rocks: \u2014 1st, limestone compact, varying in colour from grey to black, and devoid of organic remains; 2nd, sandstone; 3rd, sandstone conglomerate; 4th, red, yellow, and greenish clay; 5th, sulphate of lime or gypsum; 6th, conglomerate. All the strata are highly inclined (the angles varying from $30^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$), and they have no uniform direction. The conglomerate consists of a calcareous or silicious cement, containing boulders of granite, syenite, trap, quartz, and limestone, which last abounds in organic remains. The salt pervades all these formations, but is principally enveloped in clay, and occurs in enormous masses, one of those now worked being two hundred\nfeet thick. In colour it varies from white to flesh-colour, or brick-red. It is granular, the concretions being very large and very compact, so that platters and other utensils are made out of it, and take a high polish. Jameson states it to be so pure as to require only grinding; Burnes, on the contrary, alleges it to have a considerable mixture of some substance, probably magnesia, which renders it unfit for curing meat.\n\nThe air of the salt-mines has deadly effects on the health of those employed in them, producing chronic and wasting catarrh, and distressing and fatal affections of the lungs. In consequence, the average length of life among the miners does not exceed thirty-five or forty years. Jameson considers that considerable skill has been shewn in the working of these mines. They have been long known, being mentioned in the Ayeen Akbery. At the time of the visit of Burnes, in 1832, the total quantity of salt raised in a year amounted to eighty million pounds, and it was sold at the mine at the rate of fifty pounds for a rupee. The present price is double, the advance having been made by Gulab Singh, who now holds the mines.\n\nThe elevation of the Salt range is not considerable, and probably no summit attains the height of 2,500 feet above the sea. Burns states that these mountains contain alum, antimony, and sulphur. Jacquemont, Burnes, and Wood obtained numerous specimens of coal from various parts of them. These are rejected by Jameson as valueless, on the ground that they are \"not true bituminous coal,\"* a condemnation which, if just, must also apply to the vast and highly valuable deposits of anthracite and stone-coal in Wales, Ireland, and many other places.\n\n* Dr. Jameson elsewhere thus expresses himself:\u2014\"To the question, is any good coal likely to be found in quantity in this district? we would at once answer decidedly in the negative.\" But geology is a department of knowledge in which the field is so immense, and the data often so imperfect, that such sweeping conclusions can rarely be warranted. The opinion of a very weighty authority was widely different. Mr. James Prinsep, in reporting to government on the coal found on the western bank, stated that \"four of the specimens were in fact of the very finest form of mineral coal, that in which all vegetable appearance is lost;\" of one of the specimens, a kind of jet, he remarked \"that, if found in sufficient quantities, it would not only answer well as a fuel, but be superior to all other coals for the particular object in getting up steam, from the large proportion of inflammable gas it disengaged under combustion.\"\n\n---\n\n1 Jour.

Nar. 113.\nThe Salt range is remarkably barren. \"Vegetation is scanty, and the bold and bare precipices, some of which rise at once from the plain, present a forbidding aspect of desolation.\" About lat. $32^\\circ 50'$, long. $71^\\circ 40'$, the Indus traverses this range, making its way down a deep, narrow, rocky channel, on the sides of which the salt-beds come to light. Those parts of the range which lie on the west side of the river are denominated by Macartney the salt-hills of Kala-Bagh or Karra-Bagh, from the name of the town where its geological structure is most fully exposed to view. Its appearance there is described by Elphinstone with his usual judgment and power of language. \"Callabaugh, where we left the plain, well deserves a minute description. The Indus is here compressed by mountains into a deep channel only three hundred and fifty yards broad. The mountains on each side have an abrupt descent into the river, and a road is cut along their base for upwards of two miles. It had been widened for us, but was still so narrow, and the rock over it so steep, that no camel with a bulky load could pass. To obviate this inconvenience, twenty-eight boats had been prepared to convey our largest packages up the river. The first part of this pass is actually overhung by the town of Callabaugh, which is built in a singular manner upon the face of the hill, every street rising above its neighbour, and, I imagine, only accessible by means of the houses below it. As we passed beneath, we perceived windows and balconies at a great height, crowded with women and children. The road beyond was cut out of the solid salt at the foot of cliffs of that mineral, in some places more than one hundred feet high above the river. The salt is hard, clear, and almost pure. It would be like crystal were it not in some parts streaked and tinged with red. In some places salt-springs issue from the foot of the rocks, and leave the ground covered with a crust of the most brilliant whiteness. All the earth, particularly near the town, is almost blood-red, and this, with the strange and beautiful spectacle of the salt rocks, and the Indus flowing in a deep and clear stream through lofty mountains past this extraordinary town, presented such a scene of wonder as is seldom to be witnessed.\"\n\nThe rocks in this part of the range are\u2014first, magnesian limestone; second, new red sandstone; third, fossiliferous sandstone; fourth, red clay and sandstone, containing coal and mine-\nral sulphur, rock-salt, gypsum, brown and red iron-ore, and alum-\nslate. The lower beds contain no organic remains, but the upper\nabound in them. The iron-ore is a red or brown hematite, so\nrich that in many places the needle of the compass becomes\nquite useless, even at a considerable distance from the rocks,\nowing to their being highly magnetic, from the quantity of iron\nwhich they contain. The sandstone abounds with the exuviae of\nenormous animals, either saurians or sauroid fishes. Most of the\ntorrents of the Salt range carry down gold dust in their sands,\nwhich are washed, in search of the precious deposit, in numerous\nplaces, throughout the greater part of the year. The hills at\nKala Bagh contain great quantities of aluminous slate, from which\nalum is obtained at various manufactories at that town. The\nslate, well sprinkled with water, is laid in alternate strata with\nwood, until the pile reaches a height of from twenty-five to thirty\nfeet; it is then lighted, and the combustion continued for about\ntwelve hours, in which time the colour of the slate is converted\nfrom greyish black to dark red. This change of colour indicating\nthat the process has been carried to a sufficient extent, the mass\nis thrown into a tank holding as much water as it is computed\nthe alum is competent to saturate. After three days, the water,\nwhich becomes of a dark red colour, is drawn off, mixed with a\ndue proportion of potash, and boiled down, the residuum on\ncooling becoming a solid mass of alum. It is sold at the rate of\n1l. 19s.* for six maunds (= 384 lbs.). Dr. Jameson expatiates\nwith the earnestness of sanguine excitement on the mineral\nwealth of the Salt range, concluding in these terms:\u2014\"Such is\na rapid account of the riches of this district, and there are few,\nif any, districts in the world where iron, gold, sulphur, salt,\ngypsum, limestone, saltpetre, and coal \u2020 are met with in such\nquantity.\"\n\nSANDWALLE, in Afghanistan, a halting-place on the Boree\nor Mohavee route from Kandahar to Dera Ghazee Khan, and\nfifty miles west of the latter town.

Lat. 27\u00b0 36', long. 69\u00b0 4'.\n\nSARAWAN, in Beloochistan, a province bounded on the north and west by Afghanistan, on the east by Afghanistan and Cutch Gundava, and on the south by Jhalawan, Kelat, and Mekran. It lies between lat. 27\u00b0 58' and 30\u00b0 20', and long. 64\u00b0 and 67\u00b0 40', is about two hundred and fifty miles in length from north-east to south-west, eighty miles in its greatest breadth, and has a surface of about fifteen thousand square miles. It is in general a very mountainous, rugged, and elevated tract, rising on its northern frontier into the lofty mountain Tukatoo, supposed to have an elevation of between 11,000 and 12,000 feet, and on the east into the range which overhangs the Bolan Pass. On the west is the lofty range called the Sarawanee mountains. There are, however, some level and productive tracts. The valley of Shawl, in the north, is fertile, well watered, well cultivated, and has a fine climate, though rather sharp in winter, the snow sometimes lying for two months together. It produces in abundance grain, pulse, madder, tobacco, and excellent fruits. At some distance south of this lies the valley or plain of Mustung, resembling that of Shawl in climate, soil, and productions, but superior to it in all these respects. Between them is the Dasht-i-Bedaulut, a plain of about twenty miles in diameter, barren and uninhabited, except in spring, when it is adequately supplied with water, and supports numerous flocks and herds. For the rest of the year water is very scarce, and then the plain becomes a cheerless waste, presenting only a scanty clothing of wild thyme, and similar plants, which thrive in arid and elevated tracts. Sarawan is in general re-\nmarkably arid, having no considerable stream, except the Bolan, which flows through the Bolan Pass, into Cutch Gundava, where it is lost in the sands, and a few torrents rushing westward into the desert, where they all disappear from evaporation or absorption. Masson estimates the population of this extensive province at 50,000 persons, an amount which seems incredibly small. The only places of any importance are Shawl, or Quetta, Sarawan, and Mustung.\n\nSARAWAN, in Beloochistan, in the province of the same name, a small town containing about five hundred houses, built of mud, and surrounded by a mud wall with bastions. It is situated in a barren district, and has nothing to recommend it but a perennial supply of fine water from the little rivulet Bale. The chieftain is exempt from tribute to the Khan of Kelat, but furnishes a contingent of two hundred men when required. Lat. $28^\\circ 47'$, long. $64^\\circ 50'$.\n\nSARN, a small river in the Punjab, rises in the mountains west of Kashmir, and, joining the Dor, the united stream falls into the Indus above Torbela, in lat. $34^\\circ 12'$, long. $72^\\circ 39'$.\n\nSARUNGKOL, in the Punjab, a village about thirty miles east of the Indus, in lat. $33^\\circ 2'$, long. $72^\\circ 15'$.\n\nSATA, or SETTA, in Sinde, the greatest eastern branch of the Indus, or rather the continuation of the main stream, which formerly sent off to the west a large arm called the Buggaur. This last, however, is now almost completely closed during the season when the river is low, becoming then little else than a succession of dunds, or fresh-water pools. The Sata below the divarication is generally about a thousand yards wide. It sends off, on the left or eastern side, two branches\u2014the Mull and Moutnee, once great streams, but now, during the dry season, shallow rivulets. At the time that Carless wrote, in 1837, the Hujamree and Kedywaree mouths, which gave exit to two other branches sent off by the Sata on the right side, were navigable, but in 1839 the Hujamree mouth was closed by a great alteration in the course of the stream. Having thrown off these branches on the right and left side, the Sata, still the main stream of the Indus, and known in the lower part of its course by the names Munnejah and Wanyanee, falls into the Indian Ocean by the Kookewaree mouth, in lat. $24^\\circ 2'$, long. $67^\\circ 32'$.\n\nSATGHARRA, in the Punjab, a town on the left bank of\nthe Ravee, having several small forts, whence its name, the \"seven castles.\" It is situate in a country abounding in pasture, but in many places overrun with wood and jungle. Lat. 31\u00b0, long. 73\u00b0 20'.\n\nSATPUR, in Bultistan, or Little Tibet, a defile by which the route from the elevated table-land of Deotsuh passes into the valley of Iskardoh on its south side. At the southern entrance of the pass is a lake nearly two miles long, and about a mile wide, and on the eastern side of this the path runs along the base of a steep mountain, so that an invading force would be exposed to certain destruction by rocks rolled down the declivity. The elevation of the pass is probably about 12,000 feet. Lat. 35\u00b0, long. 75\u00b0 24'.\n\nSAUGRA, in Kafiristan, a village situate in lat. 35\u00b0 41', long. 70\u00b0 51'.\n\nSAUL, in Sinde, a village situate on the right bank of the Indus, eighteen miles south-west of the city of Hyderabad. Lat. 25\u00b0 10', long. 68\u00b0 18'.\n\nSCINDE.\u2014See SINDE.\n\nSEAH KHANA, in Afghanistan, a hamlet about sixty miles north-east of Subzawur.

Lat. 30\u00b0 6', long. 71\u00b0 18'.\n\nSEAOUIL, in Afghanistan, a village situate where the Shutul Pass over Hindoo Koosh opens into the valley of Punchshir. Lat. 35\u00b0 16', long. 69\u00b0 11'.\n\nSEBEE, or SEWEE, in Afghanistan, a town situate near the southern frontier, and fifteen miles east of the town of Dadur. During the war in Afghanistan, Sebee was occupied by a British garrison, which was withdrawn on the final evacuation of the country in 1842. The intense heat of the climate is noted by a native proverb\u2014\"O God! when you had Sewee, why need you have made hell?\" Lat. 29\u00b0 30', long. 67\u00b0 59'.\n\nSEER, in Sinde, the mouth of the Goongroo or Pinyaree branch of the Indus, which, in its lower part, is, in consequence of the dam thrown across it at Maghribee, deserted by the stream, except during the highest state of the inundation. This estuary is navigable for boats of forty tons. The Secr mouth is in lat. 23\u00b0 36', long. 68\u00b0 13'.\nSEE\u2014SEH.\n\nSEERANNEE, in Sinde, a village on the route from Hyderabad to Lucput, and sixty-five miles south-east of the former place. Lat. 24\u00b0 27', long. 68\u00b0 45'.\n\nSEETAREE, in the Punjab, a village situate on the left bank of the Indus, in lat. 29\u00b0 31', long. 70\u00b0 55'.\n\nSEHAMA, in Kashmir, a village six miles east of the town of Baramula, and in lat. 34\u00b0 10', long. 74\u00b0 18'.\n\nSEHKOH, in North-western Afghanistan, a village situate in lat. 35\u00b0 12', long. 65\u00b0 30'.\n\nSEHRA, in the Punjab, a village on the route from Koteli to Punch, and twelve miles north of the former town. Lat. 33\u00b0 39', long. 73\u00b0 50'.\n\nSEHWAN, in Sinde, a town situate on an eminence at the verge of a swamp on the right or south-west bank of the Arul, which flows from the Lake Manchur into the Indus, and which abreast of the town is about a hundred yards wide, and when lowest twelve feet deep. The Indus, a few years ago, flowed close to the town, but is now two miles distant from it. Ruined houses, mosques, and sepulchres cover here a wide space, and bear evidence of the greatness of this city before it was ruined by the Kalora princes of Sinde. The houses of the present town are of mud, often several stories high, and arched. They are superior to those usually to be seen in the towns of Sinde; but the bazaar, long, crooked, narrow, and covered with mats to exclude the scorching beams of the sun, is ill supplied with goods, and has little trade. The manufactures are inconsiderable, consisting of caps, shoes, and petty silken fabrics. The inhabitants are chiefly fishermen or beggars, which last class are supported by the pilgrims who flock to the shrine of Lal Shah Baz, whose memory stands high for sanctity, not only with Mussulmans, but also with Hindoos. The remains of this reputed saint, who was originally from Khorasan, lie in a tomb inclosed in a quadrangular edifice, covered with a dome and lantern, ornamented with smaller domes and spires, and with glazed porcelain tiles, bearing numerous inscriptions in Arabic characters. The gate is of hammered silver, as is the balustrade round the tomb, which is covered with rich cloths. The sepulchre is reputed to contain a considerable treasure, and its keepers are endowed with the gardens of Sehwan and several villages. Great numbers of pilgrims flock to this spot from all parts of Sinde and\nthe neighbouring countries, and, according to the popular belief, even the fish pay the same homage to the saint's memory. But neither the possession of so sacred a deposit, nor the example of so much devotion, has any beneficial effect on the morals of the population, who are remarkable for idleness and profligacy.\n\nNorth-west of the town, and separated from it by a deep channel, is an eminence about eighty feet high, having its sides cased with a brick wall. The summit is oval, and is twelve hundred feet long and seven hundred and fifty wide. It is covered with ruins and fragments of pottery; the remains of towers are visible along the circuit of the wall, and two fine arched gateways are in tolerable preservation. The population of Sehwan is estimated by Burnes* at about 2,000. Lat. 26\u00b0 21', long. 67\u00b0 55'.\n\nSEISAN, in Sinde, a village situate on the west side of Lake Manchur. Lat. 26\u00b0 28', long. 67\u00b0 40'.\n\nSEISTAN,\u2020 on the western frontier of Afghanistan, a district of late years sometimes under Persian, at others under Afghan sway, according as the power of either nation acquired the ascendancy. It was formerly called also Segestan, and sometimes Nimroz,\u2021 or \"the country of mid-day or the south.\" Its boundaries are set out by D'Herbelot to have been at the remote period of which he treats\u2014on the west, Khorasan; east, Mekran; south, desert of Fars; north, India. In its present extent,\u00b3 Seistan measures about a hundred miles in length from north to south, sixty miles in breadth from east to west, has a nearly oval outline, and an area of about five thousand square miles.\u2020 It lies between lat. 30\u00b0 30'\u201432\u00b0, long. 61\u00b0\u201462\u00b0 30', and is bounded on the north by Khorasan; on the east by Afghanistan; on the south by the great desert dividing the last-mentioned country from Beloochistan; on the west by Persia.\n\nConolly, to whom is due the credit of any accurate information\n\n* Personal Narrative, 41. Elsewhere (Bokhara, iii. 55, 227) at 10,000.\n\u2020 Nimroz, \u0646\u06cc\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0632, mid-day, or half a day. Kinneir relates an idle tradition that this country was called Nimrose, because being \"once entirely under water, but having been drained in the short space of half a day, by the genii, it hence received the name of Nimrose.\"\n\u2021 Christie states the area at only five hundred square miles, or a tenth of the amount set forth in the text. Conolly, however, was enabled to afford the subject a much more careful notice, and the outline laid down in his map gives the larger amount.\nwhich we possess respecting the physical geography of this country, gives the following description of the arrangement of its surface:\u2014\"The southern limit of the lower ranges of that portion of the great Caucasian chain of mountains, which lies between the 62nd and 65th meridians of east longitude, is well defined by the lower or Delaram road from Girishke to Furrah. From this line a vast desolate tract extends, part of that great desert named, rather loosely, by Malcolm the salt desert. Sloping gradually to the south-west, it descends, like the plains of Tartary, in steppes, till its progress is arrested, on the south, by a high sandy desert, and on the west by a broad and lofty chain of hills, which stretches, in a south-west direction, from probably near Ghorian to the Surhud, and thus, perhaps, connects the Parapomisan mountains (Huzarah mountains) with the southern Kohistan (highlands of Mekran). The south-west corner of this thus interrupted plain, the last and lowest steppes,* are Seistan.\"4 It is, in fact, a basin or plain, having on every side higher grounds, and receiving in its most depressed part the waters of a system of drainage extending over above a hundred thousand square miles. From the east it receives the great river Helmund, the Khash Rood, the Ibrahim Joi, and some others of less note; from the north, the Furrah Rood, the Adruscund or river of Subzawur, and some smaller streams. The only one of its streams which flows from the west is the Bundau river, thus described by Conolly:5\u2014\"During the wet season, a mountain torrent rather than a river flows south-east into the lake (Hamoon) from Bundau, by the name of which place it is known. The Bundau has a course of fifty miles, and only deserves notice as being, as far as our knowledge extends, the solitary stream which enters Seistan on the west.\" The salt and sultry desert of the south of course supplies no streams. All the above, even the Helmund, partake of the nature of mountain torrents\u2014at one time of the year rushing down with great rapidity and violence, and with a large volume of muddy water; at other times a shallow stream of clear water rolls along the bottom of their beds, which in the smaller rivers are often dry, or become a succession of pools. The Helmund, however, at all times retains a considerable body of water. Christie found it, at the end of March, four\n\n* Conolly here mistakes the German steppe, meaning \"heath,\" for the English \"step\" of stairs, or similar ascent.\n\n4 Conolly, 710.\n5 713.\nhundred yards wide, very deep, and with uncommonly fine water. The contents of these streams stagnate in the more depressed parts of the country, forming shallow lakes or morasses, the number, extent, and shape of which occasionally change as their basins are filled up with matter deposited by the currents, or an unusual quantity of water lodges on any particular spot. Of these swamps the principal are the Great Hamoon,* about seventy miles long and fifteen or twenty wide; the Duk-i-Teer, about a third of its size, and communicating with it on the eastern side; the swamp of Aishkineik, and a few others. The Hamoon of Zirreh, so denominated from a ruined town of that name on its border, at one time extended over a considerable space south of the Great Hamoon, but is now nearly dried up, in consequence of the Helmund, which formerly replenished it, having some years since deserted that part of the country. So variable are the limits of these Hamoons, or swamps, that they have different shapes in every different month of the year.\n\nThe whole of Seistan is completely level, except one small hill, the Kolizor, or Koh-i-Khwajah, rising over the Great Hamoon, near its eastern border, and not a stone is to be found, except a few rounded pebbles in the beds of the rivers. The soil is either a light and friable earth, similar to that of the neighbouring desert, or a rich alluvial loam; but, notwithstanding its fertility, forest trees are unknown, though dense jungles of tamarisk in many places overspread the surface.\n\nThe country on the banks of the Helmund, at the eastern frontier, is described by Christie\\(^6\\) in favourable terms:\u2014\"There the banks of the river are well cultivated and fruitful, having a fine rich soil, irrigated by the stream; but the utmost breadth of this fertile strip does not exceed two miles, whence the desert rises in lofty cliffs, and extends over an uninterrupted tract without water or vegetation to the great road from Herat to Kandahar on the one side, and on the other down towards the route pursued by Lieutenant Pottinger from Nooshky to Dizuk and Bunpoor. The country, though now only inhabited by Afghans and Beloochees in felt tents, still bears the marks of former civilization and opulence, and there are ruins of villages, forts, and windmills along the whole route from Rodbar to Dooshak.\" The elevation\n\n* See Hamoon in the alphabetical arrangement.\nof Seistan* does not appear to have been ascertained, but an approximation to its determination may be attempted. Kandahar is supplied with water by canals from the Urghundab, and consequently the bed of that river, at the place of their divergence, five or six miles to the west, cannot lie below the town, ascertained to have an elevation of 3,484 feet.\\(^7\\) The course of the continuous streams, Urghundab and Helmund, from the vicinity of Kandahar to the Great Hamoon, is, in round numbers, two hundred miles; and if we allow to each mile a fall of five feet, which would render the current an unnavigable and very rapid torrent, the elevation of the most depressed part of Seistan would reach about 2,500 feet. This elevation is not incompatible with the very high temperature of Seistan, as Kandahar, in the same latitude, and having a greater elevation by a thousand feet, has a very hot climate.\\(^\u2020\\) The heat in Seistan, however, exceeds that of Kandahar, and is so great as to preclude the comfortable enjoyment of life, except during the three winter months.\\(^8\\) The Gurmseh,\\(^9\\) especially on the banks of the Helmund, in the east of Seistan, is noted for the great heat of the climate.\n\nThe air throughout Seistan is unhealthy, producing various kinds of fevers, especially intermittents. The country is remarkably subject to wind, a strong steady gale blowing, during the warm six months, from the Huzareh mountains on the north, to supply the rarified air which ascends from the sultry desert lying southwards.\\(^1\\) This wind sweeps clouds of saline dust over the country, and is so distressing to the eyes that one man in every five suffers from diseases of those organs. Sometimes the wind is so loaded with sand as completely to overwhelm towns.\\(^2\\)\n\nAs is frequently the case with bodies of water having no outlet, the various Hamoons are impregnated with salt to a greater or less\n\n---\n\n* Humboldt, in the hypsometrical map annexed to his *Asie Centrale*, states the elevation half-way between Yezd and Lake Zirreh (the Great Hamoon) at 350 toises (= 2,205 feet), but giving neither the authority nor grounds for this position, it of course is of doubtful weight.\n\n\u2020 Baber\\(^1\\) states that the heat in Hindostan is not to be compared with that of Kandahar, not being above half so warm as it. Atkinson,\\(^2\\) on the 30th of July, found \"the weather intensely hot. The paper,\" he says, \"on which I am writing curls up, and is as crisp as if it was before a blazing fire.\"\n\n\u2021 \u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0629\u064c \"warm,\" and \u062c\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0633\u064e \"a place,\"\ndegree, so as in some instances not to be drinkable. The soil of the southern desert is for the most part sandy; that, on the contrary, of the north-western is a hard, compact, light-coloured clay, generally devoid of vegetation, but in some places producing a growth of tamarisks and other stunted shrubs, or of harsh dry grass. D\u2019Herbelot mentions that Seistan, according to common report, so abounded in gold, that it used to spring from the earth as if by a vegetative process. Conolly does not appear to mention gold as found in Seistan. It may, probably, be gathered from the sands of the numerous rivers.\n\nThe beasts of prey are leopards, wolves, otters, jackals, hyenas, foxes. There are also porcupines, hedgehogs, kangaroos, and rats. Wild asses and deer are very numerous. Wild hogs lurk in the marshes in great numbers, whence they issue to devastate the crops, of which it is computed that they destroy one half. They are hunted with dogs and destroyed with spear and matchlock; but the Mahometan prejudices of the Seistanis preclude them from eating the flesh of this animal; it is, therefore, abandoned to the dogs. Cows grow very fat on the reeds and sedge of the Hamoons, but are frequently subject to great mortality: horses cannot be kept in Seistan, being either destroyed by a species of venomous fly, which swarms there in surprising quantities, or by a bloody discharge from the bowels, to which the animal is liable in this country. Camels and sheep are subject to a less degree of mortality, but do not thrive very well. Water-fowl are very numerous; those of most common occurrence are pelicans, geese, and ducks.\n\nTravellers in Seistan observe numerous traces of its former populousness and industrious cultivation. Thus, according to Conolly,3 \u201cthe violent action of the swollen streams was in a great measure moderated, by large bodies of water being drawn off in canals, which were conducted in some places as far as forty miles through dry and sandy tracts. Massive embankments had also been constructed by rich and enlightened governments, which prevented the water from flowing without control, and confined it within certain bounds for the purposes of cultivation.\u201d To the same purport is the statement of Elphinstone,4 that \u201cthe numerous ruins which it still contains, testify Seistan to have been a fertile country, full of cities, which in extent and magnificence are scarcely surpassed by any in Asia.\u201d Though the fertility of\n\n---\n\n3 Ut supra, 711.\n4 Acc. of Caubul, 492.\nSeistan is in many places very great, the country is for the most part a desert, except a few spots under cultivation, producing wheat, rice, millet, cotton, tobacco, grapes, and melons; there are scarcely any trees, the largest being stunted pomegranate trees and tamarisks. The scantiness of produce appears to result from the want of industry and skill in the inhabitants to make use of their natural advantages.\n\nThe majority of the people are Tajiks, considered to be of Persian descent; with these are intermixed Belooches and Afghans. The morasses are inhabited by a very barbarous race, distinguished from the rest of the population by their tall athletic frames, dark complexions, ugly features, long faces, and large black eyes. Besides their occupation as herdsmen, they fish and fowl on rafts, amidst the reeds and rushes of the swamps. The Tajiks are Shia Mahometans; the Belooches and Afghans, Sunnis. There are also a few Hindoos. The total population, probably, does not exceed fifty or sixty thousand persons. The language is broken Persian according to Leech, who, in a hundred and fifty words, found about thirty of that language. Pushtoo is also spoken by many. The country is divided amongst a number of petty chiefs, who, according to the latest accounts, acknowledge the supremacy of the ruler of Herat. The only places worth notice are Ilumdar, Dooshak, or Jelalabad, Laush, Kash, and Furrah, and even the three last of these are not strictly within the limits assigned by Conolly to Seistan. Yet this wretched country, as observed by Elphinstone, Christie, and Conolly, contains numerous ruins of vast magnitude, indicating the high prosperity which it formerly enjoyed. Thus at Dooshak, or Jelalabad, the ruins of the ancient city cover as much ground as Isfahan. At Poolkee they extend over sixteen square miles. At Peshawuroon they are described by Christie as of immense extent, insomuch that he rode five miles across them.\n\nSeistan is classic land to the Persians. In the words of Elphinstone, \"There is no country to which an admirer of Persian poetry and romance will turn with more interest than to Seistan, and there is none where his expectations will meet with so melancholy a disappointment.\" It is especially celebrated as the ordinary residence of Rustum, of romantic celebrity among the Persians, and, at a later period, of the valiant Jacob Ben Laith. The prosperity of Seistan was terminated in the latter\npart of the fourteenth century, being, after a brave resistance, conquered in 1383, by Tamerlane, who exterminated the population, and reduced the town to heaps of ruins.\n\nSENEE, in Afghanistan, a village situate about twelve miles west of the Indus, in lat. $33^\\circ 30'$, long. $71^\\circ 54'$.\n\nSERAI-I-SHAH BEG, in Western Afghanistan, a halting-place on the route from Herat to Kandahar, and thirty miles south of the former place. It is situate on the river Adruscund, near its source, and nearly opposite to the point where it receives the Rood-i-Guz. The contiguous country affords forage, but no other supplies.

It is situate in the great eastern desert of Bhawlpore, and, though the ordinary halting-place, is devoid of water. Lat. $28^\\circ 45'$, long. $72^\\circ 83'$.\n\nSEWESTAN, in Afghanistan, an extensive tract, but little known, our scanty information concerning it being confined, in a great degree, to what the diligence and sagacity of Elphinstone enabled him to glean from native report. Its limits on the north appear to be undefined; on the east it is bounded by the Suliman mountains; on the south by the mountains inclosing Kahun, and by Cutch Gundava; on the west by the Toba and Hala ranges. With reference to the most trustworthy information that exists, it may be stated to be between lat. $29^\\circ 30'$\u2014$30^\\circ 30'$, long. $69^\\circ 30'$. According to Elphinstone's description, \"it is a flat dry plain of hardened clay; its natural defects being in some places corrected by streams from the hills, and round the town of Sewee at least it is highly cultivated.\" It is inhabited principally by the Punnee division of the great Cauker or Khaka tribe. The mountains about Kahun are, however, held by Belooches, in general engaged in hostilities with their Afghan neighbours. Sewestan is crossed throughout its whole extent, from east to\nwest, by the route from Dera Ghazee Khan to Kandahar, by the Sakhce Surwar Pass. Baber, in 1505, took this route in his march from the Indus to Lake Ab-istada, and mentions the privations endured from want of supplies for his troops in their progress. The climate is excessively hot, Sewee or Sebee, one of its few towns, being proverbially compared, on this account, to the infernal regions.\n\nSEZKOH, a village situate to the north of Bultistan, at the northern entrance of the valley of Shighur, in lat. $35^\\circ 40'$, long. $75^\\circ 19'$\n\nSHADABAD, in the north of the Punjab, and on the route from Lahore to Kashmir, by Rajawur, a spacious and magnificent caravanserai, built by one of the Mogul emperors. It is a rectangular structure, uncovered in the middle. The walls are nearly twenty feet thick, and contain cavities close to each other, and at regular intervals. These cavities, or deep niches, as they may be termed, open into the uncovered space in the middle, and are the apartments for the accommodation of travellers. Lat. $33^\\circ 2'$, long. $74^\\circ 19'$.\n\nSHADADPOOR, in Sinde, a town on the route from Larkhana to Gundava, and twenty-five miles north-west of the former place. It is situate in a barren tract, nearly destitute of population, and described by Kennedy as \"more like the bed of a salt lagoon, in an interval of spring tides, than an inland district.\" To the north-west stretches the dreary tract called the Pat, or desert, of Shikarpoor, noticed by the same writer as \"a boundless level plain of indurated clay of a dull earthen colour, and shewing signs of being sometimes under water. At first a few bushes were apparent here and there, growing gradually more and more distant, until at last not a sign of vegetable life was to be recognized.\" Lat. $27^\\circ 46'$, long. $68^\\circ$.\n\nSHADAYWARA, in the Punjab, a village situate on the left bank of the river Ravee, about twenty miles south-west of Lahore.

It is situate in a long, narrow valley, bounded on the south-west by the Panjal of Banihal, and on the north-east by a ridge of green hills several miles in length, dividing it from the valley of Bureng or Breng. The valley in some places has a width not exceeding a thousand yards. It is watered by a stream flowing from the celebrated spring of Vernag, and which lower down, where increased by several small feeders, is called the river Sandaren. Accounts received by Vigne represented the valley to be very rich in mines of iron and copper, which were worked in the time when the Afghans held it, but are now neglected, in consequence of the ignorant rapacity of the Sikhs, who would compel the natives to labour without remuneration; to avoid which hardship, those oppressed people conceal both their knowledge of the situation of the veins and of the mode of working.\n\nThe neighbourhood of Shahbad is celebrated for its fruits, especially apples, and for its wheat, considered the finest in Kashmir. The town, when visited by Moorcroft, had a bazaar and a few shops, at which provisions, coarse cloth, and very fine honey, were sold. It was formerly the residence of the most powerful of the seven hereditary Maleks, or wardens appointed by the emperor Akbar to watch over the passes of Kashmir. The Malek of Shahbad had charge of the pass of Banihal, and enjoyed a considerable income from lands held in jaghire, which hav\nbeen seized by the Afghans, so that the Kashmirian who has succeeded to the dignity receives no emolument from it. Shahbad has an elevation of 5,600 feet above the sea.

It is situate in a narrow valley embosomed in the Hubb mountains, and watered by a small stream flowing from a fine spring which never fails. The soil may be considered fertile as compared with the adjacent barren hills: it produces vines, mango, orange, and tamarind trees, besides a number of large and fine babool trees (mimosas). Here is a mosque, with a cemetery attached to it, and the Belooches believe that peculiar blessings attend the souls of those buried there. Lat. 23\u00b0 49', long. 67\u00b0 5'.\n\nSHAH BUNDER, in Sinde, in the delta of the Indus, a small place on the east bank of the channel, which discharges its water into the sea by the Mull mouth. Hither the English factory was removed from Aurungabunder or Dehrajamka, in consequence of this latter place being deserted by the water of the Indus. Previously to the dissolution of the factory here in 1775, its establishment for navigating the Indus consisted of fourteen small vessels, each of about forty tons burthen. Subsequently, this place also was deserted by the stream, and, on the re-establishment of the factory in 1799, Lahoreebunder, thirty-five miles north-west, on the Buggaur, or western branch of the Indus, was selected as its site. Shah Bunder is in lat. 24\u00b0 10', long. 67\u00b0 46'.\n\nSHAHDAYYE, in Afghanistan, a khail station or village in the Pishen valley. It is situate on a stream, or, as it is vernacularly termed, a lora, which rises at Sir-i-Aub, ten miles south of Quetta, or Shawl, and flows northwards about forty miles to Kyderzye Khail, thence westward twelve miles to Shahdazye, and four miles below that place joins the Pishen lora. The united streams flow on past Shorawuck, a hundred and twenty miles, into an abistada, or lake, about eight miles in circumference, which nearly disappears in the dry season.\n\nShahdazye is inhabited by Saiyads, or Mahometans, claiming to be descended from the prophet. The Shahdazye Saiyads are one of the three great septs of these claimants of sanctity, who inhabit\nthe valley of Pisheen, the other two being the Hyderzye and the Kerbolahe Saiyads. All three, according to tradition, are sprung from a wandering descendant of the prophet, who visited the valley and settled there many centuries ago. The Shahdazye Saiyads are considered superior to the others, and are in high repute for miraculous powers among the ignorant and superstitious population. They had formerly extensive estates, but these were seized by the Sirdars, or rulers of Kandahar, and the Saiyads are now compelled to maintain themselves by commerce and pastoral pursuits.\n\nThe khail of Shahdazye consists of about a hundred and fifty families, whose houses occupy two villages close to each other, and situate two hundred yards from the crumbling bank of the stream. A few of the best habitations are built with thick mud walls, and have roofs supported on beams, but the greater number are mere hovels. None of the inhabitants, however, are in a state of extreme indigence, and they are represented as living in concord and the exercise of mutual good-will\u2014a happy contrast to the state of society prevailing through a large part of Afghanistan.

Here were numbers of pavilions and other buildings for ornament and pleasure, but many of them were demolished or defaced by Runjeet Singh, to obtain the marble materials for the embellishment of his residence in Lahore, and the construction of his religious capital of Amritsir, and of the neighbouring fortress of Govindghar. Still there is much to cause admiration, especially the numerous beautiful fountains, abundantly supplied with water brought in an aqueduct a hundred and twenty miles in length, from Shah Jehanpoor, in the Himalaya.\n\nAccording to Osborne,\u00b2 the scene is not unworthy the magnificence of the Mogul dynasty. The following account is given by that author: \"These gardens are very beautiful,\n\n\u00b9 Masson, Bal. Afg. Panj. i. 415; F. Von Hugel, Kashmir, iii. 258; Moorcr. Punj.

They are now, however, kept in tolerable order, and, under the superintendence of any person of taste, might be made very picturesque and pretty; and even now, when the fountains are all playing and the orange-trees in blossom, their appearance is very eastern and handsome. They consist of three large terraces, inclosed within a wall of about from three to four miles in circumference. There is a small tower over every gateway, of which there are four, and a low minaret at each corner of the wall. They are filled with beautiful orange, pomegranate, and mango trees, and vines, with paved stone walks, and a canal running through the centre, with a large square tank in the middle of the gardens, from which some hundred fountains are constantly throwing water, and adding considerably to the coolness of the atmosphere.\" The splendid baths built by the Mogul emperor have been destroyed, and fragments of the marble sculptures and beautiful mosaic employed in their construction now encumber the walks: The gateways, encased in enamelled porcelain, are still in tolerable repair.

Though generally mentioned by British writers under this name, it is better known to the natives under that of Quetta.* It is meanly built of mud, and surrounded by a crenated wall of the same material, twelve hundred yards in circumference, and containing four gates. Amidst these houses, and overlooking them, is a small castle on a mound of earth, seventy or eighty feet high. Hough describes it as a most miserable mud town, with a small castle on a mound, on which there was a small gun on a rickety carriage.\" The description given by Allen is much more favourable:\u2014\"This was certainly the prettiest spot I had seen in these lands. The fertile and well-watered valley of Shaul is surrounded by hills of the boldest form, and several thousand feet in height. In the middle of the valley is the little town surrounded by a mud wall, in the centre of which rises the citadel upon a mound seventy or eighty feet high, whether artificial or natural no one could inform me.\" As the elevation above the sea is great, exceeding 5,000 feet, the cold in winter is severe, and the seasons as late as in England. Thus the British force which marched into it on the 20th of April found the spring then opening, and as the immediate vicinity of the town is fertile, well watered, and graced by numerous orchards, the scene as described by Kennedy was very pleasing:\u2014\"We rested on a noble orchard. Fine standards of the size of forest trees, apple, pear, peach, apricot, and plum, were surmounted and overhung with gigantic vines, which, wreathing round the trunks, and extending to the remotest branches, festooned from tree to tree, in a wild luxuriance of growth, such as I had never dreamed of seeing in fruit-trees and the vine. It was the first month in spring, and they were covered with blossoms which perfumed the air, and presented a picture of horticultural beauty surpassing description.\" There is an abundant supply of fine water from numerous kareezes, or subterraneous aqueducts. During our military operations in Afghanistan, this was an important post in the line of communication between Sinde and Kandahar. It was occupied in April, 1839, by the army of the\n\n* Probably for Persian plural, from \"a fort.\" According to Masson, Quetta is a word used by the Afghans as an equivalent for Kalat, fort.\nIndus in the advance on Kandahar, and retained by a garrison of two Bengal native regiments under General Nott. In the close of the same year, the Bengal detachment, returning from Kabool, marched through it; and on the arrival of the force there, General Willshire marched to storm Kelat. After General Nott removed to the command of Kandahar, possession of Shawl was retained by a regiment of native infantry cantoned in an entrenched camp near the town. In the beginning of March 1842, General England, marching from Dadur to reinforce the garrison of Kandahar, made Shawl his head-quarters, and fell back on it when repulsed at Hykulzye, in the close of the month, in his advance towards the Kojuk Pass. A month after this reverse, General England marched from Shawl, and with little difficulty forced his way to Kandahar: in the close of the following August he returned to it, having succeeded without loss in withdrawing over the Kojuk Pass thirteen pieces of artillery, and an enormous amount of baggage, conveyed by between nine and ten thousand beasts of burthen. On the 1st of October, 1842, the British force totally and finally evacuated Quetta, and marched through the Bolan Pass to Sinde. Shawl has been ascertained, by barometrical measurement, to be 5,563 feet above the sea. The population is probably about 2,000. Lat. 30\u00b0 8', long. 66\u00b0 56'.\n\nSHAWL, in Beloochistan, an elevated valley or table-land, bounded on the east by the Kurklekkce mountains overhanging the Bolan Pass, and on the west by the heights connected with Chehel Tan; on the north it has the Tukatoo mountains; on the south it ascends, with a very gentle acclivity, towards Mustoong and Kelat. Limits substantially the same with these are assigned to it by Masson: \"To the north, Shawl extends to the Khaka district of Toba; to the south it joins the district of Mastung and the plain called Dasht Bedowlat; to the east it has the Khaka district of Hanna; to the west, Peshing and Sherrud, belonging to Afghan tribes.\" According to this writer, the valley of Shawl is twelve miles in length, with an average breadth of three or four miles. It lies between lat. 30\u00b0 2'\u201430\u00b0 14', long. 66\u00b0 55'\u201467\u00b0. The drainage of the few scanty streams which water it is effected through an opening in the heights bounding it on the west. As the elevation everywhere exceeds 5,000 feet above the sea, the climate is cold in winter and\nmoderate in summer. Snow lies for two months in winter, and then such of the inhabitants as have the means emigrate to Cutch Gundava. The soil is generally fertile, being a rich black loam, yielding wheat, barley, rice, lucerne, and similar vegetation suited for fodder, besides madder, tobacco, and esculent vegetables. The wildest parts of the inclosing mountains are the haunts of wild sheep and goats; the more accessible tracts yield ample pasture to the herds and flocks of the mountaineers. The lambs are proverbially excellent. Orchards are numerous, and produce in great perfection and abundance apples, pears, plums, peaches, apricots, grapes, mulberries, pomegranates, quinces, and figs. The whole number of fixed population is supposed to be about 4,000 or 5,000, and consists of Afghans and Belooches, probably in nearly equal proportions. Besides Shawl or Quetta, the chief place, the valley contains Ispunglee, and a few other insignificant villages.\n\nSHAWPOOR, in Afghanistan, a village situate in the south of the Derajat.

It is naturally accessible on the side next the mountain, and in another part has been made so by means of stairs cut in the rock. The valley, twenty-four miles long and four or five wide, is very wild, and marked by features of great sublimity, being inclosed by vast rocky mountains with summits always covered with snow. At its upper extremity is a copious spring, having a temperature of 109\u00b0. A considerable river, rising in the Mooztaugh, holds a southerly course along the bottom of the valley, and falls into the Indus at Nynsuk, opposite to the rock of Iskardo.

It is situate fifteen miles due west of the Indus, in a country so low and level that, by means of canals from that river, it is, during the inundation, extensively flooded, and so completely is the soil saturated with moisture, that, by digging to the depth of twelve or fifteen feet, water may at any time be obtained in quantity almost without limit. The Sinde canal, dug from the Indus, passes within a mile of the town, and proceeds south-west to Larkhana. It is navigable for large boats during four months of the year. Though the inundation\u00b2 leaves extensive tracts covered with stagnant water, and the heat is excessive, the climate is not considered insalubrious, except towards the end of September, when agues prevail. The soil is alluvial, being the deposit of the waters of the canals and channels. It is so rich as to require no manure, producing very great crops in return of culture and irrigation. The town is surrounded by flourishing groves and orchards, yielding in abundance dates, mangoes, oranges, mulberries,\n\n\u00b9 Burnes, iii. 227, 277; Wood, Oxus, 54; Burnes' Pers. Narr. 57; Id.

Sugar-cane is cultivated more with a view to its consumption as a sweetmeat than for producing sugar.\n\nThe wall by which Shikarpoor was once fortified is now in ruins, but eight gates may still be traced. The circuit of the wall is 3,831 yards. The approaches to the town are bad, and when reached it exhibits nothing attractive. Much waste ground is interspersed among the houses in the inhabited part; the streets are narrow and very filthy, and the houses in general wretched. The mansions of the opulent Hindoo merchants are large, massy, gloomy piles, inclosed and secluded by high brick walls. Shikarpoor contains no public edifice worthy of notice. The character of the place is thoroughly commercial, almost every house having a shop attached to it. The bazaar extends for about eight hundred yards through the centre of the city, and is covered with rafters thatched with palm leaves. This arrangement is intended to afford protection against the rays of the sun, but it renders the air stagnant, oppressive, and injurious to health. Trade, however, appears to thrive. Conolly observes that \"the shops seemed to be well filled with the necessaries of life and various merchandize, and the people had that busy air which characterizes men engaged in active trade.\" Burnes states the number of the shops in the bazaar in 1837 at 884. Postans, in 1841, represents the number of Hindoo shops as 923. The laborious trades and handicrafts are followed exclusively by Mahometans. Burnes states the total annual value of the manufactures of Shikarpoor at 5,000l., but this is beyond question preposterously too small, and there does not appear to be any means of making a safe estimate of the amount. The transit trade is important, as the town is situate on one of the great routes from Sinde to Khorasan and Afghanistan, through the Bolan Pass, and also on that which leads northward to the Derajat, by the western side of the Indus. There is likewise a route to Kurra-chee by way of Schwan, and one to Hindostan and the eastern side of the Indus by the ferry at Roree and Sukkur, besides others of less importance. \"The direct trade of the town of Shikarpoor itself,\" Burnes observes, \"is not extensive; its port is Kurra-chee, from which it receives goods to the amount of 21,000l. annually.\" By this he seems to mean goods intended for the consumption of the town itself. The trade with Khorasan\nand Kandahar is considerable, but there is scarcely any with Northern Afghanistan, that being conducted through the Punjab and Bhawlpore. The transit trade is principally that from Marwar and the adjacent parts of Hindostan to Khorasan and Persia; but banking and other branches of monetary traffic constitute the more important departments of the commercial operations of Shikarpore. There are several Hindoos possessing large capitals, which appear to have been accumulated under the supremacy of the Afghans. The improvidence of the latter left the management of money matters to these acute financiers, who, by farming the revenue, and exacting exorbitant interest on loans, public and private, have amassed immense wealth. These capitalists are represented as enterprising, vigilant, and ravenous for gain; living impersonations of heartless avarice, but at the same time, specious, civil, and intelligent to an extraordinary degree. Their lingual acquirements are extensive, as they usually understand Persian, Belooche, Pushtoo, Hindostanee, and Sindee. Their credit stands so high that their bills can be negotiated in every part of India and Central and Western Asia, from Astracan to Calcutta. In every important town throughout this vast extent they have agents, whose families remaining at Shikarpore are a sort of hostages for their fidelity. The commerce and general prosperity of the town have rapidly declined since it has fallen under the power of Sindic rulers, but may be expected* to revive under the lately established supremacy of the British. So much disorganized had society become when Masson visited the place a few years ago, that to pass the walls was almost to incur the certainty of being robbed.\n\nThe annual revenue in Shikarpore in 1840,* according to Postans, amounted to 7,100l., divided between the Hyderabad and the Khypore Ameers, the former receiving 4,000l., the latter the residue. Masson\u2020 states that 2,500l. could only be obtained by extortion, loudly complained of. The population is estimated at 30,000.\u2021 Of these 20,000 are Hindoos, characterized by great laxity in respect to their peculiar tenets, flagrant licentiousness, and\n\n* Burns (25) states that there is no mint at which gold or bullion can be coined. Masson (i. 359) makes a statement apparently at variance with this.\n\n\u2020 Kennedy (ii. 168) states the amount at 50,000. It is probable that all the estimates are very far removed from correctness.\ngeneral disregard of principle, morality, and decency. The remaining 10,000 are Mahometans, of whom 1,000 are Afghans. These share in the general bad character of the population, being considered ignorant, crafty, contentious, and cowardly. It may be hoped that the prevalence of evil is but the result of the long course of oppression, extortion, and cruelty to which the people have been subjected by their rulers, and that under better auspices the tone of morals will be raised, while increased security will be afforded to life and property.\n\nShikarpoor was founded in 1617, and has risen on the ruin of Lukkee.

It is on the southern slope of the ridge, the crest of which forms the Punch Pass. The name, signifying literally \"thankstown,\" seems to have been intended to remind the traveller of the gratitude* due to those who erected a caravanserai, situate here for the accommodation of those toiling up the painful steep. The caravanserai, however, is now ruinous and comfortless.

The waters of the Lora, flowing from the valley of Pishcen, are lost in a swamp in the south-western part. On the banks of this stream there is considerable fertility, and fine crops of wheat, barley, and maize, are produced; but the rest of the country is a bare plain of hard clay, quite flat and very arid. It is inhabited by the Afghan tribe of Baraich.

Here are some ruins, which Burnes states to be similar to those of Sehwan, but more extensive. The most remarkable object is a mound of earth, surrounded by a brick wall, and so high as to be seen for a circuit of six or eight miles. Native tradition represents it to have been the capital of a rajah of the name of Shor, who was conquered by a king from the west, considered by Burnes to have been Alexander the Great. In the Ayeen Akbery, mention is made of Syalkote and of Shoore, two towns in this part of the Punjab, and Shorkot may, perhaps, be the ruins of one of these.

It is a\ntown of caves, resembling, though on a small scale, the celebrated\nexcavations at Bamian. As no abridgement could convey the effect\nof the description given by Carless\u00b9 of this place, his account will\nbe quoted in his own words:\u2014\u201cAbout nine miles to the northward\nof Beylah, a range of low hills sweeps in a semicircle from one side\nof the valley to the other, and forms its head. The Poorally\nriver issues from a deep ravine on the western side, and is about\ntwo hundred yards broad. It is bounded on one side by very\nsteep cliffs forty or fifty feet high, on the summit of which there\nis an ancient burying-ground, and the water runs bubbling along\nit in two or three small rivulets, among heaps of stones and\npatches of tamarisk jungle. Having crossed the stream, we pur-\nsued our way up its bed amongst the bushes, until we gained the\nnarrow ravine through which it flows, and then, turning into one\nof the lateral branches, entered Shuhr Roghan. The scene was\nsingular. On either side of a wild, broken ravine, the rocks rise\nperpendicularly to the height of four or five hundred feet, and\nare excavated, as far as can be seen in some places, where there\nis footing to ascend, up to the summit: these excavations are\nmost numerous along the lower parts of the hills, and form dis-\ntinct houses, which are uninjured by time. They consist in\ngeneral of a room fifteen feet square, forming a kind of open\nverandah, with an interior chamber of the same dimensions, to\nwhich you gain admittance by a door; there are niches for lamps\nin many, and a place-built up and covered in, apparently intended\nto hold grain. Most of them had been plastered over with clay,\nand in a few, when the form of the rock allowed of its being done,\nthe interior of the apartment is lighted by small windows. The\nhouses at the summit of the cliffs are now inaccessible, from the\nnarrow, precipitous paths by which they were approached having\nbeen worn away, and those at the base appear to have been occu-\npied by the poorer class of inhabitants, for many of them are\n\n\u00b9 Jour. As. Soc.\nBeng.1839, p. 191,\nAcc. of a Jour. to\nBeylah.\nmerely irregular-shaped holes with a rudely-constructed door.\"\n\nThese excavations, like those at Bamian, are made in a conglomerate of no great consistency or hardness. After recounting the native legend of a beauteous princess (Buddul Tumaul), harassed, like the bride of Tobit, by demons, who slew her seven lovers (the seven friends) in succession, and who was at length rescued by Syful Mullik, the son of the king of Egypt, the description proceeds:\u2014\"A short distance above the entrance of the city, the broken, precipitous ravine in which it is situated decreases in width to ten or twelve yards, and forms a deep natural channel in the rock. For about half a mile the cliffs are excavated on both sides to a considerable height, and, taking the remains of the houses into account, I think there cannot be less altogether than fifteen hundred. In one place a row of seven was pointed out by the guides as the residence of 'the seven friends,' and further on we came to the grandest of all, the palace of Buddul Tumaul. At this part, the hill, by the abrupt turning of the ravine, juts out in a narrow point, and towards the extremity forms a natural wall of rock, about three hundred feet high and twenty thick; half-way up it had been cut through, and a chamber constructed about twenty feet square, with the two opposite sides open; it is entered by a passage leading through a mass of rock partly overhanging, and on the other side of the apartment two doors give admittance to two spacious rooms. The whole had once been plastered over, and, from its situation, must have formed a safe and commodious retreat. At the summit of the hill, near it, there is another building, which my attendants said was the mosque where the princess was rescued by Syful Mullik, when the demons attempted to carry her off.\" Exclusive of the fanciful tradition already alluded to, all record is silent respecting the origin of these singular relics.

Its size is considerable, and at a distance, with its lofty and irregularly-built fortifications, it has a striking and picturesque appearance. The walls are mounted with a few guns, and defended by\na small garrison. There is a good and well-supplied bazaar. Its principal manufactures are cottons and wood-turnery; the excellence of the latter is much celebrated. The gardens belonging to the town are extensive and luxuriant, and the surrounding country is fertile as well as highly cultivated, yielding great crops of sugar-cane, cotton, grain, and indigo. It belongs to the Sikhs.

Lat. $26^\\circ 30'$, long. $70^\\circ 3'$.\n\n**SINDE**, an extensive and important country of Western India, so called, probably, from the river Sinde* or Indus. Others\n\n* From Sindh or Sindh, Sanscrit for sea or \"collection of water,\" Shakespear in v. There are numerous similar instances in various\nconsider that the name, both of the river and the country, is derived from the word Sindhi, synonymous with Hindi, as the inhabitants from the first dawn of recorded knowledge have principally been of the great Hindoo family. It is bounded on the north by Beloochistan, Afghanistan, and Bhawlpoor, on the east by Jessulmair and Marwar, on the south by Cutch and the Indian Ocean, on the west by Beloochistan, and is situated between lat. $28^\\circ 32'$\u2014$28^\\circ 50'$, and long. $66^\\circ 37'$\u2014$71^\\circ 16'$. It is three hundred and eighty miles long from north to south, three hundred miles in its greatest breadth from east to west, and contains a surface of about sixty thousand square miles.\u2020 Its seacoast, washed by the Indian Ocean, extends a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, in a north-west direction, from the Koree or greatest mouth of the Indus (long deserted by the stream), situate in lat. $23^\\circ 30'$, long. $68^\\circ 25'$, to Cape Monze, or Ras Mooarree, in lat. $24^\\circ 48'$, long. $66^\\circ 38'$. This whole extent of coast, except the part intervening between Kurrahee and Cape Monze, which are distant from each other about fifteen miles, is very low, being merely a series of mud banks deposited by the Indus, or, in a few places, low sand-hills, blown in from the sea-beach. With the exception of those few sand-hills, \"the shore,\" observes Carless, \"is low and flat throughout, and at high water partially overflowed to a considerable distance inland. With the exception of a few spots covered with jungle, it is entirely destitute of trees or shrubs, and nothing is seen for many miles but a dreary swamp. Whenever this occurs, the land is scarcely discernible two miles from the shore.\" Wood also observes\u2014\"The coast line is submerged at spring tides, when the delta of the Indus resembles a low champagne tract of verdure, with tufts of mangrove dotted along its seaward edge.\" Burnes, too, states that the coast of Sinde is not distinguishable a league parts of the world of great tracts denominated from rivers, as many states of North America, departments of France, and circles of Germany.\n\n* According to the native Sindian history, in the usual style of national vanity\u2014\"Sindh is so called from Sindh, the brother of Hindh, the son of Noah, whose descendants for many generations ruled that country.\"\u2014Postans, Extracts from T\u00f6hfat ul Kiram and the Chach Nameh. (Transacts. of As. Soc. of Bengal, 1838, 298; and 1841, 184.)\n\n\u2020 This estimate is given from careful measurement on Walker's excellent map of the north-west frontier. The estimate given by Burnes (iii. p. 212) of 100,000 square miles is unquestionably exaggerated.\nfrom the shore. Westward of the Garrah estuary, and between it and Kurrachee, the southern extremity of the Hala or Pubb mountains approaches the shore, the point of Munnoora, which forms the southern shelter of the harbour of Kurrachee, being rocky; but with the exception of this point, the coast itself is like that eastward, low and alluvial, and so continues westward to Cape Monze or Ras Mooarree, which rises from the sea to a moderate height. The sea of the coast is very shallow, so that, according to Wood, a vessel of 1,000 tons could scarcely come in sight of the Sindian coast; the soundings, however, in general decrease so gradually and regularly, that in the fine season there is no danger in approaching it. The shallowness of the sea appears to be mainly owing to the enormous quantity of mud deposited by the water of the Indus. A bank extends all along the coast from Kurrachee to Cutch, reaching from two or three miles to five or six from land, and being in most places dry at low water. The only shoal which projects to any considerable distance is the Great Munnejah Bank, which has a hard, smooth bottom, and which should be approached with much care by large vessels. The tides are extremely irregular, both in direction and height, rising in the south-eastern part of the coast about four feet, and among some of the great channels as much as twelve feet. The flow and ebb are exceedingly violent and rapid, sweeping over the low lands, and retiring with a velocity and force not easily conceived by those who have not witnessed them. The influence of the tide is perceptible for seventy-five miles from the ocean, or about twenty-five miles above Tatta. The south-west monsoon reaches the coast of Sinde, and though it does not bring much rain, blows with extreme violence, rendering navigation perilous after the beginning of March. Of the eleven mouths of the Indus, only two, the Hujamree* and Kookewarree, are navigable in sea-going vessels from the sea to the main channel of the river; and as on the bar of the former there are only thirteen feet of water at full tide, on the latter only ten feet, while the sea breaks violently on them during the stormy season, it is inevitable destruction for a ship then to attempt to\n\n* According to the account of Kennedy, however, the Hujamree mouth was closed in 1839 by one of those violent changes frequent in the shifting shoals and channels of the Indus, \"and has now no river communication with Tatta, or junction with the main stream.\"\nenter them. In the winter months the weather is very mild; the fleet, which in 1838 conveyed the British armament to the mouth of the Indus, remained for nearly the whole month of November at anchor in the open roadstead, at the mouth of the Hujamree, and during that time experienced no inconvenience. The capability of the coast of Sinde for the purposes of navigation is thus summed up by Wood:\u2014\u201cIt is plain to all who are conversant with nautical affairs that Kurrachee is the only safe seaport for the valley of the Indus. When the season is favourable, the merchant may indeed send his goods direct to the mouth of the Indus; but every thing here is subject to such constant change\u2014the weather, the depth of water, the channels, and the very embouchure itself\u2014that this voyage, even in February, is not without hazards.\u201d He then observes, that as the danger of entering the river is greater than of leaving it, exports may be sent from the mouths in November, December, and January, but that all imports should be brought by Kurrachee. It should be observed, however, that though sea-going ships of 400 or 500 tons can at no time safely enter the river, yet smaller vessels, if their draught do not exceed six or seven feet, may do so. An inland navigation, or even a ship canal, could probably be easily made from Kurrachee to the deepest and most navigable part of the Indus below Hyderabad, as the Garrah, a small stream communicating with the Indus, falls into the sea* at that port, and is navigable from it for boats as far as Garrah Kot, a distance of forty miles.\n\nKurrachee, the only port in Sinde for sea-going ships of burthen amounting to four or five hundred tons, has, at high water, a depth of two fathoms and a half, and at spring tides of three fathoms; but, during the south-west monsoon, the swell is so great on the bar, that it is highly dangerous to cross. The Kookewarree, called the Gora by Burnes, the principal mouth\n\n* Carless (Official Report on the State and Navigation of the Indus, p. 6) uses these words:\u2014\u201cThe Garrah, a small stream that conducts them (large boats) to the harbour of Corachee;\u201d and Masson states, that \u201cthe salt water creek of Garrah has a communication with Karachi;\u201d but in the MS. map of Sinde of the Quartermaster-general, No. 1, the mouth of the Garrah is laid down on the eastern side of Kurrachee Bay, and ten miles east of the entrance into the harbour. The intervening country is, however, represented by Pottinger and Horsburgh as perfectly level, and consequently a canal could easily be dug through it.\nof the Indus, is one thousand one hundred yards wide; the Hu-\njamree, until lately next in importance, five hundred; the\nPittee, seven hundred at low water\u2014at other times between\neight and nine hundred yards. The Koree mouth is the most\neastern, forming the boundary of Sinde towards Cutch. It has\nlong been deserted by the stream, except in very great inunda-\ntions, when sometimes the Poorana and Fulailee branches pour\ntheir waters into it. Burnes states its breadth at Cotasir, twenty\nmiles from the sea, to be seven miles, and that it increases, pro-\nceeding downward, until neither shore can be seen. He however\nadds, very justly, that it is nothing more than an arm of the\nsea.*\n\nThe base or seaward line of the delta of the Indus measures,\nfrom the Garrah mouth, in lat. 24\u00b0 43', long. 67\u00b0 9', to the\nSir mouth, in lat. 23\u00b0 35', long. 68\u00b0 15', about one hundred and\ntwenty-five miles. If it be regarded as having the shape of a tri-\nangle, to which it in some degree approximates, the perpendicular\nmeasured from the sea-shore to the vertex, near Tatta, where the\ngreat branches of the Indus\u2014the Sata, or eastern, the Buggaur,\nor western\u2014divaricate, is about fifty miles, and its surface is\nabout three thousand square miles; but as the river has in\n\n* This statement is probably referred to by Zimmerman (Geographische\nAnalyse der Karte von Inner-Asien), s. 115, where he states the breadth of\n\"eine Indus-Mundung\" at twelve miles, and quotes Arrian, Burnes, and\nCarless, without giving any exact reference, an inconvenient practice, and which\non this occasion tends to implicate the last-mentioned authority, generally\nhighly accurate and judicious, in what cannot be regarded otherwise than as a\ngross exaggeration. Pottinger states, the western branch, or Buggaur, falling\ninto the sea at lat. 24\u00b0 8', and consequently at the point corresponding with\nthe actual position of the Khedjwarree mouth, to have a breadth of nine miles\nat Darajee and of twelve miles at its mouth, and this error has been copied\ninto a vast number of elaborate and expensive maps from that prefixed to his\naccount of Beloochistan. As if this were not sufficient, Kennedy states that\nPottinger informed him that the breadth was upwards of twenty miles!\nWhen the British army forded this branch in 1838, during the low season,\nit was fifty yards wide and two feet and a half deep; and Burnes, in 1830,\nfound it two hundred yards wide near Meerpoor. Pottinger, indeed, furnishes\nan apology for the more extravagant dimensions, in declaring that they were\n\"from the best native information I could procure.\" It has been suggested\nthat a great change has taken place in the dimensions of that part of the river\nsince Pottinger wrote, but in various charts of the coast given by Dalrymple,\nthere are no such vast openings as those in question.\nsome degree deserted a considerable portion of the southeastern part, the present delta proper does not probably contain more than two thousand five hundred square miles. Unlike the densely wooded delta of the Ganges, it is nearly destitute of timber, resembling in this respect that of the Nile. It is almost level, of alluvial soil, apparently brought down by the Indus, and consisting of vegetable mould, clay, and sand, which becomes hard soon after being deposited,\\(^1\\) even in the channels of the river. There are, however, even within the limits of the delta proper, and eastward of the Buggaur or western branch of the Indus, some rocky hills,\\(^2\\) known by the name of the Mukali Hills (which see). Near the Pittee,\\(^3\\) or western mouth of the river, is a dangerous rock, the only point in the delta south of the range just described which is not alluvial.\n\nAlong the sea-coast, and for several miles inland, the delta is one of the most miserable countries in the world. The tide overflows the ground, and, on receding, leaves a dreary swamp, covered, wherever the water is brackish, with stunted mangrove trees, yet affording pasture for numerous herds of buffaloes, but in most places destitute of fresh water, which must be brought from a distance.\\(^4\\) The inundation here, during the summer months, is very extensive,\\(^5\\) and, in consequence of the shifting nature of the channel, vessels are frequently left aground. Burnes\\(^6\\) estimates that one-eighth of the delta is occupied by streams or canals. Where water cannot be obtained at such a level as to admit of being conducted through the fields by means of channels, it is raised by the Persian wheel. The soil, where not well watered, becomes a clay nearly as hard as if it were baked, producing tamarisks,\\(^7\\) *mimosae*, *euphorbia*, furze, cactuses, and various saline plants. In the dry time of the year, this clay is raised in clouds of dust,\\(^8\\) so dense as to threaten suffocation. Under the influence of water, however, the soil is very productive, especially of a gigantic grass, attaining the height of twelve or eighteen feet, and so thick that it is difficult to force a passage through it. Where the alluvial soil of the delta has been long deposited, it produces lofty acacias, attaining a girth of seven or eight feet. On the fall of the waters of the Indus, numerous *dunds*, or extensive pieces of water, are left, and swarm with the finest fish, which, with those\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Carless, 6.\n\n\\(^2\\) Wood, Oxus, 16; Outram, 16; Kennedy, i. 76, 96; Burnes' Pers.

But extensive portions of this country have been depopulated by the Ameers of Sinde, to form Shikargahs or hunting-preserves, now consisting of dense thickets of tamarisks, saline plants, shrubs, and brambles. One of the finest parts is a long, narrow island, extending from north to south, a distance of about one hundred miles, with an average breadth of about eight; inclosed by the Indus on the east, and on the west by the Narra. The greatest extent of this alluvial land in the upper part of Sinde appears to be about Khyerpoor, Shikarpoor, and Larkhana, where canals and watercourses, communicating with the Indus, during inundation cover the surface to a wide range with water, which both irrigates the ground and deposits on it a fertilizing slime. According to Postans, the soil is so rich that no manure of any kind is used, though it regularly produces two crops every year, and sometimes three; and Macmurdo states, that \"the fertility of this province in those parts which are exposed to the floods of the Indus is exceeded by that of no tract of country on the earth.\" Throughout the alluvial tracts of Sinde, the soil contains saltpetre in great abundance, and it is largely extracted both for home consumption and for exportation.\n\nAn extensive alluvial region stretches eastward of the fertile tract along the Indus, but being now generally deserted by the water of the river, it has become a desert, yielding scanty pasture to camels or horned cattle, and in the less frequented parts occupied only by the fleet goorkhur, or wild ass. Through it flows the Eastern Narra during the height of the inundations of the Indus. The great doab contained between this branch and the Indus is on an average about seventy or eighty miles wide; the soil consisting generally of a hard sun-baked clay, like the rest of the alluvial soil of Sinde where devoid of water. In this doab are two low ranges of recent limestone; the more southern, that of Hyderabad, about one hundred feet high, and on one part of which that city is situate; the more northern running north-westward from the vicinity of Jes-\nsulmair, and towards the Indus attaining an elevation of a hundred and fifty feet, and abounding in flint, which forms, almost exclusively, the rocks on which Roree and Bukkur stand. These ranges are not, however, completely continuous, being cut by valleys, through one of which the Narra already mentioned holds its course; through another, the Fulailee branch, insulating Hyderabad.\n\nThe stiff nature of the deposit of the river is, probably, owing to its course in the upper part generally lying through a very mountainous region, principally of primitive formation. In the more southern part of Sinde, the soil has a very large admixture of sand, and is sometimes so impregnated with common salt that, as Lord observes, \"it is not uncommon to see the same soil, which during the season of irrigation had yielded crops of grain, transferred afterwards to the Salt-pan, and furnishing, by the simple process of pouring water over it, which is subsequently evaporated, an abundant supply of salt.\" The moisture, so indispensable to the productiveness of the soil, is altogether supplied by the water of the Indus, rain in Sinde being very scanty and uncertain. In consequence, the country, where destitute of the means of irrigation, becomes a desert. Of this nature, on the north-east, is the Pat, or desert of Shikarpoor, lying between that town and the Bolan Pass, and apparently consisting of the clay deposited by the Bolan, the Nari, and other torrents which flow down from the Hala mountains, and which are all lost in this dreary tract. It is about ninety miles across, and, according to Kennedy, in some places resembles \"the dry bed of a salt lagoon in an interval between spring tides;\" in others, it is a level plain of indurated clay of a dull earthy colour, and having the appearance of being occasionally under water, but during the dry season exhibiting, at long intervals, a few wretched, parched, and stunted shrubs, but without a single blade of grass or other herbage. In the eastern part, and in general reaching to within twenty miles or even a less distance of the river, is a region called the Thur, or desert, having considerable resemblance to that just described, except that it is much more sandy; extensive tracts being covered with sand-hills, varying and shifting under the influence of the tempests of the wilderness. Yet, in many places there is a considerable growth of low shrubs, coarse herbage, and prickly, saline, or aromatic plants, affording pas-\n\n---\n\n6 Lord, 61.\n7 Masson, 350; Outram, 57; Kennedy, i. 189; Havelock, i. 184; Hough, 47.\n8 Elph. 8, 9.\n9 Macmurdo, on Sinde, in Jour. Roy. As. Soc. 1834, p. 291; Masson, i. 19.\nturage for camels, buffaloes, kine, sheep, and goats, all in continual motion in search of water, or its concomitant, vegetation. Numerous beds of rivers long dried up intersect this arid tract, appearing to indicate that the waters of the Indus, or of some of the Punjab rivers, once found their way through it. Vestiges of ancient towns also may be observed, in great quantities of fragments of bricks and pottery in some places strewed over the surface. That the Indus, which now finds its way through the limestone rocks at Roree, might at one time have poured its waters in many branches over this waste, at present parched, is by no means improbable, as there are unequivocal indications, that it formerly flowed fifty feet\\(^1\\) above its present level, in the channel between Sukkur and Roree, and that the country on both sides of the river along the base of the limestone range was at that time under water. The old course of the river\\(^2\\) may also be traced along the northern base of that rocky range, which stretching nearly one hundred miles to the south-eastward, must have sent the water of the Indus over the surface of the country now become the Eastern Desert since it has been deserted by the stream. This limestone range, commencing in Cutch Gundava, proceeds, as already mentioned, south-east towards Jessulmair, being cut by the channel of the Indus between Roree and Sukkur, where way may have originally been made for the stream by one of those earthquakes the traces of which are observable elsewhere in that region. The passage here, however formed originally, it is certain has, in a long course of ages, been deepened greatly by the force of the current, and thus an adequate efflux afforded for the water, which may formerly have been poured over the Thur, and found its way to the sea by the eastern mouths and the Run, or great salt-marsh of Cutch. With the exception of this range of hills stretching from Roree towards Jessulmair, and the Gunjah hills\\(^3\\) east of the Indus, on which Hyderabad is built, in Lower Sinde, the eastern part of this country is quite level. On the west\\(^4\\) of the Indus, the Hala, or Brahooic mountains, under various denominations, stretch, with diminished height, to the bank of the river at Sehwan, and southward, to the sea at Cape Monze. Of these, the Pubb range is the most western, its ridge forming the boundary on the side of Beloochistan. Among its valleys and ravines runs the Hubb, the only permanent river of the country, except the Indus. It\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Westmacott, Acc. of Roree, Jour. As. Soc.

The whole of that part of Sinde between Kur-rachee and Sehwan is a maze of hills, known by various denominations, Jutteel, Keertar, and Lukkee. The Lukkee are considered the highest, having an elevation, where greatest, variously estimated at 1,500\\(^5\\) and 2,000 feet.\\(^6\\) They terminate abruptly on the west bank of the Indus.\\(^7\\)\n\nThe climate of Sinde is remarkably sultry and dry. As Lord\\(^8\\) observes:\u2014\u201cSituated on the verge of two monsoons, it is unrefreshed by the waters of either. The south-west monsoon,\u201d he proceeds, \u201cterminates at Lucput Bunder (on the western coast of Cutch), as accurately as though it covenanted not to violate the Sindh frontier.\u201d The north-west monsoon, which deluges the country to the west, comes no farther than Kurrachee, and even there the annual fall of rain does not exceed six or eight inches. At Hyderabad, the rain of an entire twelve-month amounted only to 2'55*\\(^9\\) inches; and farther north, at Larkhana. Three years had elapsed continuously without rain,\\(^1\\) at the time of Hamilton\u2019s visit in 1699; the consequence was a pestilence, which cut off one-half of the population.\\(^\u2020\\) But Burnes, in travelling through the delta on the 10th of April, experienced very heavy showers, and a severe fall of hail; and in June, 1809, during the visit of the British mission, the rain\\(^2\\) fell so heavily there that the streets frequently resembled rivulets, and none could stir abroad. In the following August the rains were again excessively heavy during the stay of the mission at Hyderabad. The N.W. monsoon commences in February, and continues about four months,\\(^\u2021\\) rendering the navigation\\(^3\\) along the coast at that\n\n---\n\n\\* Lord quotes Wood\u2019s Meteorological Tables, but those given by Wood in the Official Survey of Carless contain some astounding statements; e.g., in p. 39 it is stated that fifty-two inches of rain fell on the 13th of July, a quantity which probably never fell in any one day in any country in the world since the deluge. An error, therefore (probably the omission of the decimal point), is to be suspected. The total quantity during the month he states at fifty-eight inches.\n\n\u2020 Such is strictly the substance of the statement made by Hamilton (New Account of the East Indies, 8vo. Edin. 1727, vol. i. p. 122). Burnes, referring to it, says: \u201cI observe in Hamilton\u2019s India that there is frequently dearth of it (rain) here for three years at a time,\u201d which is not correct.\n\n\u2021 Postans (Observations on Commerce of the Indus, 8) states, that the\ntime dangerous, and nearly impracticable. Notwithstanding the discrepancy in our information on the subject, there can be little doubt that, throughout Sinde, the climate is generally too dry for the purposes of agriculture, except in the parts irrigated by means of the river. On this subject the Ameer of Khyerpoor remarked to Burnes, that rain always brought disease, and that they were better without it. The temperature is very high in summer. Lord states the mean maximum of the temperature of the atmosphere at Hyderabad, during the six hottest months, to be $98.5^\\circ$ in the shade, and considers it the greatest hitherto registered in an authenticated form. The water of the Indus at that time attains the temperature of $92^\\circ$ or $93^\\circ$ when highest, and consequently very nearly blood-heat. There appears reason for concluding that the temperature is still higher in Northern Sinde, where the cooling influence of the ocean cannot extend. Burnes states it at $96^\\circ$ at Khyerpoor in the beginning of April. In Northern Sinde, however, frost is not unknown, and ice has been observed in February. In January the difference of the temperature at night and during the day has been found as much as $40^\\circ$, the thermometer ranging to $84^\\circ$ and upwards. So high, however, in general is the temperature in Lower Sinde, that there is, in fact, no winter. The great heat in summer, the innumerable stagnant pools left by the inundation, and the decaying vegetable matter deposited on the surface or mixed with the soil, produce in many places pestilential exhalations very fatal to health, especially in strangers, and in the dry season the winds sweep from the surface vast clouds of dust impregnated with common salt and nitre, highly injurious to the lungs, and still more to the eyes. The unwholesome nature of the water obtained from the wells increases the evils of the climate, and produces fatal complaints of the bowels, liver, and urinary organs. Violent catarrh or influenza is at some periods of the year general. Fever and ague prove very fatal in moist situations, and Kennedy informs us that the British force stationed at Tatta \"suffered a sickness and mortality beyond all he had ever known among native troops in India.\" The most unwholesome communication is closed, during the monsoon, for the months of May, June, July, and a portion of August.\n\n* Lord quotes Wood, but his tables, as given in Carless, do not show so high a temperature.\nseason is autumn, and during that of 1840, the whole of the 26th regiment, stationed in Lower Sinde, was, with the exception of three persons, attacked with fever, and nearly one hundred died. The climate and air of Kurrachee are by far the most salubrious in Sinde. In consequence of the unwholesomeness of the climate in Lower Sinde, the infirmities of age are in general premature in their approach, and life is of short duration.\n\nThe natural history of Sinde has not received the attention due to so important a subject. The shores of the delta and its numerous inlets are overgrown in most places with mangrove-trees (Coccoloba uvifera?), where the brackish water reaches. It is a low tree, but frequently has a girth of twelve feet. The ground everywhere in the delta, where deserted by the water, becomes a jungle of tamarisk, springing up so closely as to present, when a few inches high, the appearance of a verdant field, and affording, in the tender shoots, an excellent food for cattle. It furnishes the common fuel of the country, and also the wood principally employed for carpentry and boat-building. Its twigs are used for mats, baskets, and similar purposes. It is called lye by the natives, but appears to be the Tamarix orientalis or articulata of our botanists. The other trees are babool, or mimosa, of which several kinds, yielding good fuel, abound in the arid wastes; jal, or pelloo (Salvadora Persica), is found chiefly where the irrigated tract and desert join. Besides these may be mentioned the neem (Melia azadarachta), the pepul (Ficus religiosa), the bir (Zizyphus jujuba), the elegantly-formed Parkinsonia aculeata, the Jerusalem thorn of the West Indians; the juwassi, a prickly shrub, a favourite food of the camel; the tallee, the most valuable of the timber-trees of this country; the kurreel, or caper, a stunted tree, with crooked wood, well suited for boat-building; the kundie, resembling the last in size, and in being suited for the same purposes. A few others of no importance, besides various sorts of wild and fruitless palms, might be added to the list. The date-palm, according to tradition, was introduced by the conquering armies of the Khalifs. Wild rue, and other odoriferous plants, occasionally enliven the arid deserts, accompanied often by various species of salsola, or saltwort, turned to advantage by the natives, who burn them, and extract soda from the ashes; the toolse, or Ocymum sanctum, abounds, but is supposed to have been introduced from Central Hindostan: the egg-\nplant (*Solanum melongena*) is abundant, and much esteemed as an esculent.* A gigantic grass, called *cana*, and in some places *moonj*, is very abundant in moist situations, where it grows to the height of from twelve to twenty feet, and is so thick, strong, and crowded together, as to form a sort of thicket, through which it is very difficult to force a way. It is very useful for making mats, baskets, thatch, ropes, and for other similar purposes.\n\nA large collection illustrative of the zoology of the country was made during the exploratory expedition of Burnes in 1837, but the results do not appear to have been given to the public.\u2020 The *goorkhur*, or wild ass, a species of the genus *equus*, and in shape resembling the *quagga* of Southern Africa, roams in large herds over the *Thur*, or Eastern Desert, which is also frequented by various species of antelopes. Tigers abound in the jungle by the river side; also hyenas, wolves, jackals, foxes, otters, badgers, wild hogs, deer, hog-deer (*Axis porcinus*), porcupines, hares. Porpoises, or some similar *cetacea*, called by the natives *bolun*, abound in the Indus. The *guryal*, or slender-snouted alligator, is also common in the river and creeks, and is considered harmless. The common alligator swarms in the hot pools formed by the thermal springs near Kurrachee. Two hundred large ones are said to have been found in one piece of water one hundred and twenty yards in circumference. Snakes, scorpions, and centipedes are to be met with. Leeches are numerous in many places, and much used for surgical purposes. There are birds in great number and variety, especially water-fowl. The flamingo, *phoenicopterus*, frequents the shores of the delta, as does the pelican, which attains a great size, being inferior in this respect only to the ostrich; one taken by Burnes stood four feet high, and measured nine feet eight inches from tip to tip of its wings. Water-fowl are so plentiful that in some places a wild goose may be bought for less than a halfpenny, and two or three ducks for the same sum. Bustards, partridges, quails, jungle-fowl (the wild stock of our com-\n\n---\n\n* Lord states that both the *pepul*, or *Ficus religiosa*, and the *banyan*, or *Ficus Indica*, grow in Sinde. Burnes states that the banyan is not to be found there.\n\n\u2020 Burnes states, that the drawing and information obtained in his mission of 1837, concerning the zoology of Sinde, comprised, of genera and species, twenty *mammalia*, one hundred and ninety-one birds, thirty-six fishes, eleven reptiles, besides two hundred in other departments of natural history.\nmon domestic fowl), various kinds of parrots and perroquets, *merops*, or bee-eaters, crows, and several sorts of small birds, are of common occurrence. The birds of prey are the vulture, and various kinds of falcon. Burnes enumerates five varieties of them. Fish is peculiarly abundant, and forms the principal animal food of the lower orders, who are often reproached with this circumstance by neighbouring nations, and supposed to be rendered stupid by the nature of their diet. The fishermen and their families form a considerable portion of the population, living on the river in boats during the inundation, and in temporary huts of boughs and reeds when the river is low. Burnes estimated that a thousand boats are employed on Lake Manchar alone.\n\nAn extravagant addiction to field-sports characterized the Ameers of Sinde, who sacrificed to it the welfare and even the existence of their subjects, laying waste and inclosing extensive cultivated tracts to form their *shikargahs*, or hunting-jungles. One of the Ameers, some years ago, depopulated, near the capital, an extensive tract of fertile ground, and converted it into a shikargah, though this foolish and monstrous act of tyranny caused a loss of revenue equal to 20,000l. or 30,000l. a year. Another razed a village to the ground, because the noise of the population and domestic animals was considered to disturb the game of a neighbouring preserve.\n\nThere are generally two harvests in Sinde; the *rubbee*, or spring harvest, reaped from seed sown in autumn, and the *kureef*, or autumn harvest, which is sown in spring. The rubbee crops in general consist of wheat, barley, oil-seeds, millet (*Holcus sorghum*), the *durra* of the Arabians, and called here *bajree*, opium, hemp, tobacco; the kureef crop consists of those productions which require considerable heat to bring them to maturity, such as rice, sugar-cane, cotton, indigo, maize. Pulse and pumpkins, cucumbers, melons, and esculent vegetables, are sown for both crops, and some products are sown indifferently for either. Rice appears to be the staple crop, and, with maize and wheat, forms the principal article of diet, besides being exported in great quantities. The fruits are dates, mangoes, plantains, *Musa paradisiaca*, pomegranates, limes, citrons, figs, apricots, apples, plums, tamarinds, mulberries, pistachio and some other kinds of nuts, and melons. They, in general, are of inferior quality; the grapes especially are small and sour. The plantations of date-palms are very\ngeneral and extensive, and the fruit is used largely for food and for distillation, by which process a strong spirit is drawn from it. As food, it is found to be of a very heating nature.\n\nCamels \\(^2\\) are bred in great numbers in the salt-marshes of the \\(^2\\) Indus, and, though such tracts might seem very uncongenial to the nature of that animal, those reared there are considered very hardy, strong, and enduring, especially of thirst, in consequence of the scanty supply of fresh water in their original soil. The value of the camel is not confined to its virtues as a beast of burden: its milk is a favourite article of diet (though it spoils if not used very fresh), and its hair is woven into coarse cloths. Buffaloes are kept in great numbers in the swampy tracts, where they may be seen wallowing in the mud with their heads \\(^3\\) only above water. Their flesh is excellent, and their milk is preferred to that of cows, yielding better butter, which, when clarified, forms, under the name of ghee, a great article of commerce. A considerable trade is also driven in the hides of these animals. Sheep and goats abound in Upper Sinde, especially on the borders of the Pat of Shikarpoor, and of the Thur, or Eastern Desert. The former district, called Boordgah, produces the best wool in Sinde, both of goats and sheep, and both animals are kept throughout Upper Sinde,\\(^4\\) as well for their fleeces as for their milk and flesh. The wool is taken from the carcase of the animal only when slain for food, as the heat would cause its death after losing its fleece. The coarser wool is manufactured into bags, ropes, and strong cloths. The finer might be obtained in such quantities as to be an important branch of commerce, for which, however, there has been hitherto but little encouragement. The horses of Sinde are small and of mean appearance, but hardy,\\(^5\\) active, and enduring. They are mostly used for the saddle, the beasts of burden being the camel, the mule, and the ass. The camel is the dromedary or one-humped variety, and the finer descriptions are used for the saddle, carrying generally the rider and his attendant.\\(^6\\) The breed of asses is small, but they are neatly made, strong, active, capable of enduring great fatigue, and of living and thriving on the coarsest fare. The mules are large, strong, handsome, and quick in pace.\n\nAs the import trade of Sinde is inconsiderable, the demand of its people for manufactured goods must be, in a great measure, supplied from their own skill and labour; but that demand is\nsmall, as they are for the most part very poor, and their habits very simple. The state of manufacturing industry is generally rude, and few articles are produced suited for exportation. The peasantry of the delta manufacture a few coarse cloths and felts from the hair and wool of their flocks and herds, and mats of reeds, sedge, straw, and grass, for constructing their moveable houses. At Hyderabad, the fabrication of swords, spears, fire-arms, and other arms, offensive and defensive, has been greatly encouraged by the Ameers, and in consequence is carried to a degree of perfection surprising among a people in general so unskilled. Weaving and embroidery are also skilfully conducted there.\n\nPaper is manufactured to some extent, and of good quality, at Roree, Shikarpoor, Larkhana, and some other towns. Tanning is successfully carried on, especially at Larkhana, where excellent shoes, sword-belts, and leather water-bags are made. The bark used is generally that of the acacia. Potteries are universally diffused, and the ware produced, though not in general distinguished by elegance, is sound and strong, the clay being of excellent quality. The pottery of Halla forms an exception to the usual style, being remarkable for tasteful shape and colouring.\n\nThe Belooches of Sinde, instead of turbans, wear caps, like high-crowned hats without a brim, and these are manufactured in great quantities, and in a handsome style, of cotton, silk, and wool. The manufacture of woollens is both trifling and unskilful, though the Sindians have wool in abundance, and much admire British woollen cloths, which, however, they are in general too poor to purchase. Gunpowder is manufactured in most towns. Silk goods are fabricated at Tatta, Roree, Khyerpoor, and Shikarpoor, the raw material being principally obtained from Persia and Central Asia. Tatta also manufactures loongees, or rich narrow cloths of silk and cotton, sometimes intermixed with golden thread, and embroidered. Loongees of a coarser description are made at Ranepoor, and some other towns in the vicinity of Khyerpoor. Coarse cottons are produced at Tatta, Khyerpoor, and the neighbouring towns, Muttaree, Larkhana, Shikarpoor, and, indeed, at most towns; but this branch of manufacture has been impaired by the importation of cheaper and handsomer fabrics from Hindostan and Britain. Dyeing is an extensive branch of manufacture, the principal dyes being indigo, madder, and sakur, which last some describe as a knot.\nor excrescence on the tamarisk; others, as its blossom, dried and pulverized. Kirmiz, extensively used for giving a crimson colour, is the product of the *coccus querci*, and is frequently confounded with cochineal, though a different article.\n\nThe transit trade between the British possessions in India and the countries west of the Indus has hitherto been principally conducted through Bhawlpore and the Punjab. Now that the navigation of the Indus is kept open and protected by the British Government, and that many improvements, by means of steam and otherwise, will probably be introduced in the mode of conducting it, the greater portion of the trade may be expected to take its course either through Kurrachee, Sehwan, Larkhana, and Shikarpoor, by the Bolan Pass, or else up the Indus, through the Derajat, by the middle and northern passes. The principal transit trade at present passes by three courses\u2014first, by Hyderabad to Larkhana, or Shikarpoor, and subsequently by the Gundava or Bolan passes; secondly, from Marwar and Central India, across Khyerpoor and by Shikarpoor, to the Bolan Pass; thirdly, from Kurrachee, by Sehwan, Larkhana, and the Bolan Pass. The principal imports, either for transit or home consumption, are silk, cotton, and woollen goods, raw silk, opium, and other drugs; madder and various other dyes; groceries, hardware, metals, turquoises, and other precious stones; glass, chinaware, shields of leather, timber, cordage, bamboos, and dried fruits. Sinde at present has few exports; the more important are rice, and other grain; ghee, or clarified butter, and hides (all sent principally by sea); from the Delta, fish, wool, salt, saltpetre, oil, and oil-seeds; *pabbadee*, or nuts of the *Nymphaea Nelumbo*, bark for tanning, vegetable alkalis, firewood, and gum; a few coarse drugs, and dye-stuffs, sulphur, camels, and horses. To these, under proper management, might be added cotton, silk, tobacco, and opium. The sugar of Sinde is considered of inferior quality. In 1837, when Burnes wrote, the custom-dues of Kurrachee were farmed for 7,000l.; those of Darajee for 700l.; those of Vikkur for 4,000l.; those of Maghribee for 3,200l., and those of Hyderabad for 12,500l.; a total of 27,400l.* for Lower Sinde. The estimated amount of the duties of Khyerpoor, or\n\n* Such would be the amount, taking the rupee at two shillings; but as the standard of this coin is lower in Sinde, the actual amount is something less.\nUpper Sinde, at the same time, was 10,000l. annually. The vessels belonging to the port of Kurrachee were about one hundred dingees, or small sea-going vessels, drawing from nine to twelve feet of water, and of burthen from fifty to two hundred tons, ill-constructed and put together, unable to weather severe storms, and hence lying idle during the violence of the monsoons. From four hundred to five hundred sea-going boats sailed out of the port of Vikkur in 1836, but this channel, according to the statement of Kennedy, was closed up in 1839. Burnes estimates the whole of the imports of Lower Sinde at four lacs of rupees, or 40,000l.; and if 30,000l. be allowed for Upper Sinde, the whole will amount to 70,000l. annually for a population probably not less than 1,000,000.\n\nThe Sindians of the present day are a mixed race, consisting partly of the Juts, probably aboriginal Sindians, of Hindoo extraction (many of whom have been converted to Mahometanism), and the Belooches, who have settled here in recent times. Those Hindoos who have adhered to their original religion and manners are divided into Bhattias and Lohannas, with their respective gurus, or pastors, and the Pokarna and Sarsat Brahmans. They deviate much in their mode of life from the Hindoos of Hindostan Proper, and this laxity is more particularly observable in the Lohannas, who are the most numerous. These last decline no means of subsistence, and readily entered into the service of the Ameers, in which case they were obliged to wear their beards like the Mahometans. Compulsory conversions to Mahometanism were not unfrequent; the helpless Hindoo being forcibly subjected to circumcision on slight or misconstrued profession, or the false testimony of abandoned Mahometans. It is still more remarkable, that this forcible conversion was sometimes inflicted as a punishment, and in all instances operated as an irreparable loss of caste. The Mahometan population sprung from the converted Hindoos are a peaceable race, generally engaged in agriculture, and are despised by the Belooches, who affect a bold and martial character. In this, the latter have been encouraged by the Ameers of the same descent as themselves. Besides these distinctive races, there is a large part of the population the offspring of their intermarriages. The Hindoos, however, in many places, form a very large proportion of the population; at Shikarpore, for instance, they are estimated at two-thirds. There are likewise\na few Afghans, especially in the north-western part of the country.\n\nThe Sindians, collectively, are described as handsome, though dark complexions; well limbed, but inclined to corpulency, and above the middle size. The beauty of their women is proverbial, and Pottinger remarks, that among the numerous sets of dancing girls whom he saw, there was not one who did not display loveliness of face or symmetry of figure. The Belooches, and the mixed race between them and the Hindoos, are considered the finest part of the population. They have \"an oval contour of face, aquiline nose, arched eye-brows, and high forehead, with expressive eyes.\" The character of no people, perhaps, has been visited with greater obloquy than that of the Sindians. Pottinger represents them as \"avaricious, full of deceit, cruel, ungrateful, strangers to veracity;\" and adds, that among bordering nations, the term \"Sindian dog\" is synonymous with \"treacherous liar.\" Macmurdo observes, that \"with most, if not all, the vices common to Asiatics, the Sindians appear to possess few, or none, of their virtues,\" and declares them \"the most bigoted, the most self-sufficient, and the most ignorant people on record.\" Burnes, on the contrary, gives a favourable estimate of their character; having found those with whom he had transactions kindly, grateful, faithful, and of unimpeachable honesty; as the traveller and his company lost nothing in their progress through the country, though all they possessed was at the mercy of the rude individuals casually drawn to serve as guards or servants; and when the British army, in 1839, marched through Sinde to Afghanistan, the people acted with great honesty, and it was observed, that a similar camp would have suffered more from robberies in one night in Guzerat, than we [the British] had done for the three months we had been in Sinde.\" The charge of cruelty, also, is discountenanced by reference to the various occasions on which British envoys and agents visited and explored Sinde, with views dreaded and detested by its rulers, but without becoming the victims of any Sindian cruel or treacherous actions. They are charged with adulation, but their expressions and manners in this respect appear to amount to little more than awkward and overstrained attempts at politeness. The natural results, indeed, of their semi-barbarous state and long-continued misgovernment are apparent. The people are grossly ignorant and bigoted, and inclined to be tricky in matters of business. The Hindoos engaged\nin mercantile concerns are especially avaricious and overreaching. Their warriors are swaggering and boastful; individually brave, but deeming it no disgrace to take to flight if their first onset fail. This class consists almost exclusively either of men of Beloochee descent, or of Belooches by birth, who have been driven by want to leave their native mountains, and whose warlike and predatory character became well known to our troops, during the late military operations. So frequently have this class recourse to arms, that it is rare to see one of them without several sword wounds.\n\nThe country, though remarkable for fertility, being, from social and political causes, so ill cultivated, that it with difficulty maintains its very limited population, swarms with a vagrant and idle race of men, alternately soldiers, beggars, and thieves.\u201d These, in great numbers, seek service with foreign powers, and, in Western India, hold the next place to the Arabs as mercenary troops. The Mussulmans are generally Sunnis, or of the more numerous class of Mahometans, who recognize the succession of the three first Khalifs; but the Ameers, and others of the great, were Shias, or votaries of Ali. There is a great number of Saiyids, or those who claim descent from Mahomet, and who, upon the strength of their claims, have succeeded in obtaining considerable grants of lands from successive rulers, and are among the most prosperous persons in the country. The country is also overrun with a prodigious number of Fakeers,\u2014lazy, worthless mendicants, who, under the guise of religion, subsist on arms or contributions extorted by importunity or threats. The Beloochian Sindians differ from other Mahometans in wearing the hair of the head long, as well as that of the beard. The dress of the men consists of a loose shirt, a pair of trowsers gathered at the ankles, a kummerbund or scarf round the waist, and a quilted woollen or cotton cap, shaped like a hat without a brim, and often ornamented with embroidery of silk or gold round the bottom. The great wear turbans of enormous size, Pottering having seen some two feet or two feet and a half in diameter, and containing seventy or eighty yards of gauze from eight to twelve inches in breadth. The women dress like the men, except that they do not wear the cap, and that, when out of doors, they wrap themselves in a long, loose cloth, having one end fastened on the crown of the head, so that it can be drawn\nover the face on the approach of a stranger. The filth of the Sindians cannot be denied or extenuated; it is proverbial, and may, perhaps, be attributed to their poverty. Sinde is supposed by Sir William Jones to have been the original country of the gypsies,* who, according to Adelung,5 fled from India to escape the massacres of the ruthless Tamerlane. The Sindian language is a branch of the Sanscrit or Indo-Germanic stock, merely a little differing in spelling and inflexion from the pure Hindi6 of Upper India, and is by some considered the elder of the two, being more elaborate and regular in the inflexions of its nouns and verbs. Macmurdo7 states, on the authority of native scholars, that \"it has fewer modern innovations, and a greater number of Sanscrit words, than the Gujarati, which is a pure Hindoo dialect.\" It has a character peculiar to itself, which is written from left to right. Belochee,8 another of the Indo-Germanic tongues, is of course largely spoken, especially in the hilly country; and Persian may be regarded as the language of the court9 and of the higher order of the people.\n\nFrom the period when Sinde was visited by the Greeks under Alexander, its history is in a great degree a blank. Native annalists appear to be magniloquent in regard to the grandeur, power, and resources of some of its princes; and, on the event of a revolution, brought about through the criminal passion of a queen for a young Brahmin, who was enabled by her favour to ascend, first to the office of chief minister, and subsequently to the throne, the historian who records the facts indulges in the following burst of mingled grief and admiration:1\u2014\"Such was the close of the race of Rajah Sazee, which had governed the kingdom of Sinde for upwards of two thousand years; whose princes, at one period, received tribute from eleven dependent kingdoms, and who had set the threats of the greatest monarchs of the world at defiance.\" According to Pottinger,2 the dominions of the Rajah Sazee (including his tributaries) are described by native authorities as extending, \"on the north, to the present provinces of Kashmir and Kabool; southward, to Surat and the island now called Dieu; westward, along the sea-coast to Meck-\n\n* Besides the older work of Grellman on this subject, see \"Harriot on the Oriental Origin of the Gypsies,\" in Transact. of Royal As. Soc., vol. ii. 518\u2014538; also Richardson on the Bazeegurs, vol. vii. 437, of As. Researches; and Klaproth (Asia Polyglotta) on the branches of Sanscrit.\nran; and eastward, to the provinces of Marwar, Beckaneer, &c.\" In the sixth century of the Christian era the country was invaded by the Persians, and to this invasion probably refers the allusion of the enthusiastic chronicler above quoted to the defiance offered by the royal house of Sinde to \"the greatest monarchs of the world.\" The result, however, was disastrous to the reigning prince, though unproductive of any permanent change in the relation of the two countries. The Persians defeated the Rajah in a pitched battle, in which the prince fell. But the object of the invaders appears to have been not so much conquest as plunder, and, having secured as much booty as they had the means of carrying away, they departed. Among the spoils which they bore from Sinde were some thousands of its most beautiful women.\n\nAt an early period of the Khalifate, the reputed wealth of Sinde seems to have excited the cupidity of the representatives of the prophet, but their attempts, for a time, were unsuccessful. A subsequent invasion was attended by a different result. The Khalifs were in the habit of importing slave-girls from Sinde, and a party of the followers of the Khalif Abool Mulik, in charge of a selection of Hindoo beauties, destined for the harem of their master, were attacked by the Rajah's troops, some of them killed, and the remainder made prisoners. This occurrence provoked a hostile visit from a Mahometan army. The Rajah was permitted to remain quiet in his capital while the enemy were ravaging his dominions with fire and sword, and when, at last, he left the city with his army, it was but to encounter disaster, defeat, and death. The events of the battle transferred the kingdom to Mahometan rule.*\n\n*The victory gained by the Mahometans was followed by a remarkable instance of oriental revenge. Among the captives were two daughters of the Rajah, esteemed, it is said, the most beautiful women in Asia, and who, in conformity with Eastern custom, were reserved to grace the harem of the Khalif. The princesses meditated vengeance on the general, whose success deprived their father of his throne and life, and reduced them to captivity in a foreign land; and, on their arrival at Bagdad, effected their object, by accusing him of conduct which involved a breach of duty to his master, as well as an outrage on the feelings of his illustrious prisoners. The Khalif, enraged at the alleged insult, ordered the supposed offender to be sewn up in the raw hide of a cow, and in this manner brought into his presence. The sentence was inflicted, and the unfortunate general, thus ungratefully recompensed for\nSome centuries later, Sinde became a tributary to the empire of Ghuznee. On the dissolution of that empire, the Sindian chiefs asserted their independence against the Ghoorun during many years, and with various success. Ultimately they were compelled to yield, and Sinde became a constituent part of the Imperial dominions. In the time of Baber, it was invaded and conquered by the prince dispossessed by that emperor at Kandahar. The invader was subsequently compelled to yield the larger portion of his conquest. He soon made an effort to regain what his father had lost, but found new enemies, to whom he was compelled to make large sacrifices. Sinde then, for a time, maintained a claim to independence, but was the scene of great disorders, two successive princes being afflicted with insanity in its most outrageous form. Late in the sixteenth century it yielded to the emperor Akbar, and for about a hundred and fifty years it remained in the usual condition of oriental dependencies; its chiefs usually professing unqualified submission to the emperor; paying tribute when they could no longer postpone it; but scrupulously evading that acknowledgment of supremacy whenever their fears were not sufficiently active to prompt to a different course. In 1739, Sinde fell to the Persian conqueror, Nadir Shah. On his death, and the consequent dismemberment of his empire, it seems to have reverted to its nominal subjection to the imperial throne of Delhi. In 1756, Sinde was included in certain territories forming part of a dowry bestowed by the reigning emperor upon Tymur, son of Ahmed Shah Durani. It is thenceforward to be regarded as an appendage of Kabool, the new relation being maintained precisely in the same mode as that previously existing with the sovereign of Delhi. In 1779, a rebellion was raised by the Talpoor tribe of Belooches against the reigning Nawaub of the Kuloora tribe, who was defeated and forced to fly. He was reinstated in his dominions by the aid of the ruler of Kabool, and the in-\n\nhis success, died on the third day after being subjected to the punishment. The tale was subsequently discovered to have been fabricated, and the vengeance of the Khalif, then directed towards the beautiful, but vindictive princesses, was manifested in a mode not less characteristic of Eastern cruelty, than was the punishment inflicted on their victim. He ordered them, after being totally divested of clothing, to be tied by the hair of their heads to the tails of horses, and in this manner dragged through the streets of Bagdad till they were dead. The horrible sentence was executed, and the mangled remains of the sufferers then ignominiously cast into the river.\n\nPott, 380, note.\nsurgents retired. They soon, however, returned, deposed the Kuloora prince once more, and took possession of his throne and power. The ruler of Kabool again advanced to maintain the rights of his dependent, but the usurpers had collected an army superior to that of the Afghans, which they totally defeated. This was in 1786. Fortune being against the Afghan prince, it only remained for him to make the best terms he could. The battle was followed by negotiation; in virtue of which, the Talpoor chief engaged to discharge all arrears of tribute, and to meet the accruing payments in future with punctuality. Within little more than three years, presuming on the inability of the nominal emperor to coerce them, the rulers of Sinde signified their indisposition to paying tribute at all, and the weakness of the Duranic government insured to them for a time impunity. Zeman Shah approached their frontier in 1794, to enforce the demand of his house, but was prevailed on to return with a small portion only of the arrears due. A similar result attended the advance of Shoojah-ool-Mook in 1809. He received a sum equal to something more than one-third of the amount which had accumulated, and returned, perhaps not altogether indisposed to congratulate himself on his good fortune in obtaining any thing. The disturbances which subsequently prevailed in Afghanistan were admirably calculated to gratify the dislike of the Ameers to dispensing any part of their treasures in the shape of tribute.\n\nThe government of Sinde, under the Talpoor dynasty, has been quaintly described by Kennedy, as \"a tailor-like personification of royalty, requiring precisely nine Ameers or princes to make up one sovereign.\" In 1786, when Meer Futtch Ali, the Belooche chief of the Talpoor tribe, succeeded in expelling the Calora dynasty, and was recognized by the Durani monarch, he assigned large tracts of country to those of his relatives who had aided his enterprise to Sohrab Khyrpoor and Northern Sinde, to Thara Meerpoor in the south-east, with the adjoining country, at the same time investing them with independent powers. He reserved Hyderabad and the greater part of the country for himself and his three brothers, residing with them in the same palace, and publicly administering the government with them in the same common durbar (hall of audience). Thus the country became divided into the three states\u2014Hyderabad, Khyrpoor, and Meerpoor\u2014each having their little knot of Ameers, or\nrulers. In 1839 there were four Ameers of Hyderabad, the sons of the first who enjoyed the dignity. There were, at the same time, three Ameers at Khypoor, and one, or according to Kennedy, two, at Meerpoor. The revenue of the three states has been estimated by Pottinger at sixty-one lacs of rupees, or 610,000l.; by Macmurdo, about twenty years later, at half a crore, or 500,000l.; by Burnes, about the same time, at thirty lacs, or 300,000l.; of which he assigns 150,000l. to Hyderabad, 100,000l. to Khypoor, and 50,000l. to Meerpoor. So necessarily uncertain and liable to error must statements of this nature be respecting such barbarous and ill-governed states. Burnes, in the same page, states, \"the treasure, it is said, amounts to about twenty millions sterling, thirteen of which are in money, and the remainder in jewels.\" He does not, however, explain how this enormous sum could have been saved in less than fifty years, out of an annual income not exceeding 300,000l. sterling. The revenue was derived in part from customs, dues, and other imposts, but principally from a proportion of the produce of such lands as have not been granted in jaghir, or feudal tenure, to individuals. In some cases the revenue was collected in kind, in others in money. The amount, exacted in proportion to the gross produce, was regulated by the greater or less fertility, or facilities for irrigation, and being in some instances a third, in some a fourth, and in some as low as a fifth. These rent-payments are in general as moderate as those required on similar accounts in India, and more so than those usually exacted in Britain.\n\nThe government under the Talpoor Ameers appears to have been a military despotism, unchecked, except by a regard to the dogmas of Islam. The Ameers held courts of justice every Friday, and reserved to themselves the right of deciding in cases of life and death. Those potentates, in time of peace, had no more standing army than was sufficient to guard their persons and treasury, to collect the revenue, and retain the forts. Their avarice made them keep the regular military force so low in point of number, that it probably did not exceed one thousand five hundred men. For great and important occasions of national warfare, the army consisted of a feudal soldiery, maintained by the respective chieftains, to whom had been allotted jaghires or\n\n* Who wrote between 1813, which year he mentions (p. 401), and 1816, when his work was published.\ngrants, on condition of bringing into the field a proportionate number of men, for whom they were responsible, incurring forfeitures in cases of serious misconduct. These retainers usually belonged to the tribe of their chiefs, and worked in their lands and households when not on military service. When called out, these troops received in addition a scanty pay from the Ameers. These men were either Belooches, or of the mixed race descended from them and the Hindoos, and were overloaded with arms, carrying shield, sword, matchlock, and knife. They generally move to the field of battle mounted on camels, horses, mules, or ponies, and there dismount, and, after a few shots from their matchlocks, throw them away; and, being excited with large doses of opium, rush sword in hand, and with loud shouts, on their enemy. They are represented as ignorant of manoeuvring, and, if not immediately successful, as ready to break and take to flight; yet, in their late conflicts with our troops, they displayed steady and enduring bravery. Leech estimates the total number of irregular troops enrolled for the service of the Ameers, and available for emergencies, at one hundred and two thousand men; but adds, that sixty thousand by the Hyderabad and Meerpoor Ameers, and thirty thousand by those of Khyrpoor, are as many as could be brought into the field. Even this number is unquestionably too large an estimate, and the true amount probably did not exceed half of it. The artillery was wretchedly inefficient, consisting of a few guns of various and irregular sizes, ill-constructed originally, and for the most part nearly useless from decay, mounted on rude and crazy carriages, and ill-served. The gunpowder also was of inferior quality, though saltpetre may be had in great abundance, and sulphur is obtained from the hills on the western frontier. The forts, Omercote, Hyderabad, Islamcote, Deejiy, Munorah, and Bukkur, are described under those respective names.\n\nThe population of the towns of Sinde has been very variously estimated; and the following table, though it has received much care, can be regarded only as a tolerable approximation to the truth:\u2014\nHyderabad, the residence of the principal Ameers 20,000 1\nShikarpoor ... ... ... ... ... 30,000 2\nKhyerpoor ... ... ... ... ... 15,000 3\nKurrachee ... ... ... ... ... 15,000 4\nTatta ... ... ... ... ... 12,000 5\nMeerpoor ... ... ... ... ... 10,000 6\nHalla ... ... ... ... ... *10,000 7\nLarkhana ... ... ... ... ... 10,000 8\nRoree ... ... ... ... ... 8,000 9\nAlla yar ka tanda ... ... ... ... 5,000 1\nSubzulcote ... ... ... ... ... 5,000 2\nSukkur ... ... ... ... ... 4,000 3\nMuttaree ... ... ... ... ... 5,000 4\nBeyan\u2020 ... ... ... ... ... 2,000 5\nMajinda ... ... ... ... ... 2,000 6\nSehwan ... ... ... ... ... 2,000 7\nSunn ... ... ... ... ... 2,000 8\n\nThe population is in general most dense at a distance of two or more miles from the banks of the Indus, as the lands may there have the advantage of irrigation without the dangers incurred by nearer proximity to the stream. The immediate banks 9 are in general overrun with jungle, and deserted, except during the fishing season, when they are frequented by busy crowds. The total population of Sinde is stated by Burnes at 1,000,000, or something more than sixteen to the square mile: an estimate which, when the great extent of arid desert and the general imperfect cultivation are considered, seems too high.\n\nThe relations of the British government with Sinde were at no time very close or very friendly. It was always characterized by coldness and suspicion on the part of the Sindian authorities, and sometimes by stronger marks of dislike. The agents of the East-India Company resorted thither for the purposes of trade, but early in the present century the commercial resident of the Company was violently expelled, and a large amount of property in his custody seized. According to Pottinger, 1 an attempt was made to murder the resident. That author deems it matter for regret that on that occasion the Ameers were not \"made to feel\n\n* Yet Burnes (iii. 264) states the population at 2,000!\n\u2020 Probably the Beeah in the alphabetical arrangement of the present work.\n\nVOL. II.\nthe force of our arms within their dominions; had that been the case,\" he continues, \"their conduct would doubtless have been of a very different nature towards the late missions to their court.\" Those missions were treated in various instances with great indecorum, and attempts were made to cast indignity on them in matters of etiquette and ceremony. In 1809, however, a treaty was concluded,\\(^1\\) the most important article of which was the following: \"The government of Sinde will not allow the establishment of the tribe of the French in Sinde;\" it being then an important point to exclude from the vicinity of our Indian possessions an enemy who had long been desirous of attacking them.\n\nIn 1820, another treaty was concluded, the chief object of which seems to have been the exclusion of European and American adventurers from the dominions of the Amecs. A new treaty was formed in 1832, the most important provisions of which are those relating to the opening of the roads and the river of Sinde to the merchants of India. This privilege is stipulated for by the third article, and by the fifth, fixed and moderate duties are to be levied; but the concession was shackled by three conditions: First, that no military stores should pass; second, that no armed vessel or boat should come by the river; and third, that no English merchant should settle in Sinde, but should come as occasion might require, transact their business, and return to India. The third restriction was a step in retrogression, it having been stipulated in the treaty of 1820, that \"if any of the subjects of either of the two states (the British and the Sinian) should establish their residence in the dominions of the other, and should conduct themselves in an orderly and peaceable manner in the territory to which they may emigrate, they will be allowed to remain in that situation.\" The change sufficiently marks the jealous feeling of the Ameers towards the British Government; while the first and second of the restrictions operated materially to diminish the value of the opening of the Indus. A commercial treaty was concluded in the same year, and thus rested the relations of the Anglo-Indian Government and Sinde till 1836, when Runjeet Singh prepared to carry into effect a design which he had long meditated, of reducing Sinde to subjection to himself. By the interposition of the Government, however, he was prevailed upon to suspend his progress, and the opportunity being thought favourable for establishing a closer connection with Sinde, Colonel\n\n\\(^1\\) Corresp. relating to Sinde.\nPottinger was despatched to negotiate for the purpose. After a measure of delay, proportioned to the practice of Eastern courts, a treaty was concluded in April, 1838, which possessed at least the merit of brevity. It contained only five articles; by the first of which the British Government engaged its good offices to adjust the differences between the Ameers and Runjeet Singh; by the second, it was stipulated that an accredited British minister should reside at the court of Hyderabad, and that the Ameers should be at liberty to depute a vakeel to reside at the court of the British Government.\n\nThe British Government was now engaged in a series of measures designed to erect a barrier to the Anglo-Indian empire, by settling Afghanistan under a prince believed to be friendly to British interests, and an invasion of that country was meditated for the purpose of restoring Shoojah-ool-Moolk to the possession of the dominions then held by Dost Mahomed Khan and his relations. With a view to this, a tripartite treaty was concluded in July, 1838, the parties thereto being the British Government of India, the exiled Shah Shoojah-ool-Moolk, and the Sikh chieftain Runjeet Singh. Preparatory to carrying out its object, it became necessary to establish some more satisfactory relation with Sinde, and measures were taken accordingly, on which the treaty above mentioned was signed; a copy of it with other papers, illustrative of the existing policy of the British Government, was transmitted to Colonel Pottinger, who was instructed to the following effect:\u2014He was to apprize the Ameers of the conviction of the Governor-General, that a crisis had arrived at which it was essentially requisite to the security of British India that the real friends of that power should unequivocally manifest their attachment: he was to inform them of the intentions of the British Government with regard to the westward, and to point out articles in the tripartite treaty, by which that government engaged to arbitrate on the claim of Shoojah-ool-Moolk, as sovereign of Afghanistan, upon the Ameers of Sinde, and proposed to bring also to a final settlement the claims of Runjeet Singh, as connected with the Shah and with the territories along the course of the Indus, formerly included within the dominions of the Afghan kingdom. Colonel Pottinger was also to intimate the approach of Shah Shoojah, supported by a British force, to express a hope, on the part of the Governor-General, in the friendly dispositions of the\nAmeers, and to warn them that the disappointment of that hope would render necessary the temporary occupation of Shikarpoor and of as much of the adjacent country as might be required to afford a secure basis to the contemplated military operations, while, by neglecting to avail themselves of the proffered mediation in regard to the claim of Shoojah, they would become exposed to the full effect of any measures which he might deem proper for the enforcement of his claim, which, under such a supposition, the Governor-General could not interfere to control. The instructions advert to some other points, but the above are the chief.\n\nColonel Pottinger, in the discharge of his duty, had to encounter a full share of the impediments usual in Oriental diplomacy, and the general conduct of the Ameers of Hyderabad was such as to lead to an unqualified suspicion of their hostile feelings; the British army, however, passed without molestation, and the members of the British mission were compelled to take their departure. Alexander Burnes's was somewhat less difficult, though here a great obstacle to the conclusion of terms existed in the demand of the British Government for the surrender of the fortress of Bukkur. The Ameers at length gave way, and signed a general treaty of alliance, together with the most unpalatable article conveying to his ally the right of occupying the strongest hold in his dominions. The Hyderabad Ameers also finally gave way, and after various unsuccessful attempts at agreement, ratified a treaty originally consisting of twenty-one articles, but which had been cut down by the Governor-General, Lord Auckland, to fourteen. Among the articles expunged were several prescribing the manner in which intercourse should be carried on with the port of Kurrachee. Hostile possession of that place had previously been taken by a British force, and the Governor-General regarded this fact as placing in the hands of the captors the power of dictating the terms on which intercourse with the fort should be carried on. The general effect of the treaty was to place the territory of the Ameers of Hyderabad in a state of subsidiary dependency on the British Government. A treaty, nearly corresponding with that entered into with the Hyderabad chiefs, was subsequently concluded with Mere Shere Mohamed Khan, Ameer of Meerpoor.\n\nThese arrangements did not prevent the recurrence of disputes.\nThe disasters encountered by the English in Afghanistan were calculated to call forth the latent particles of enmity to that power wherever they might lurk, and some of the Ameers at last were confidently believed to have passed beyond hostile wishes, and to have committed themselves to acts inconsistent with their relations of perfect amity and alliance with the British Government. These circumstances were thought to call for some considerable changes in the existing treaties, and Sir Charles Napier was intrusted to negotiate new treaties,* his diplomatic functions being sustained.\n\n* The terms proposed to the Ameers will be found in the following extract from a letter addressed by the Governor-General, Lord Ellenborough, to Sir Charles Napier, 4th November, 1842:\n\n\"Having stated to you, in my letter of yesterday's date, the position in which it appears to me that the British Government stands with respect to certain of the Ameers of Upper and Lower Sinde, I will now communicate to you my views as to the course which should be pursued.\n\n\"2. The free navigation of the Indus through the dominions of the Ameers of Lower Sinde, and the free introduction of all articles of consumption into the British cantonments, are already provided for by the treaty of 1839; and the strict observance of these provisions must be enforced.\n\n\"3. They appear to be sufficient for the purpose without any alteration in words.\n\n\"4. The engagement of Meer Roostum Khan in the treaty of 1838, that he would acquiesce in the arrangements made by other powers for the free navigation of the Indus, must be construed as binding him to the performance of the engagements subsequently entered into by the Ameers of Lower Sinde for that object; but it will be necessary to proceed one step further, and to require that all articles of consumption shall be freely introduced into the British cantonments.\n\n\"5. I have always considered that the obligation on the part of the native State to pay tribute to our Government is one which places us in a false position. No character can be more offensive than that of an exacting creditor, with which this obligation invests us. It gives rise to constant discussion of an unfriendly nature between our Government and that of the native States, and it makes us appear to be the cause of all the exactions which the native State inflicts upon its subjects. I desire, therefore, to base the new arrangements to be made with the Ameers of Lower Sinde upon the abolition of all tribute now payable by them to the British Government.\n\n\"6. In exchange for the tribute given up by us, we should exact the cession of territory. In the first instance, the surrender of territory would be as painful to the Ameers as the exaction of tribute; but the latter is a grievance constantly recurring, brought continually to the recollection by incessant applications for payment, which the debtor State continually invents excuses\nby a considerable military force to act against the Ameers in case of necessity. The Ameers hesitated, but ultimately the treaty to evade or defer. The cession of territory is a grievance which, once submitted to, is in time almost forgotten; and in this case a large portion of the territory to be demanded is of recent conquest, not a part of any ancient possession.\n\n\"7. Another provision which it appears to me to be expedient to introduce into a revised treaty with the Ameers, is one for the establishment of uniformity of currency in their dominions.\n\n\"8. The inconveniences and evils which arise from the intermixture of currencies of various and changing values are constantly forcing themselves upon my attention. I desire ultimately to establish one uniform currency throughout India. This is a convenient opportunity for introducing a provision to that effect with respect to Sinde. I am aware that native States attach much importance to the right of coinage. I shall endeavour, as far as any feelings of pride are concerned, to save those feelings, by an engagement to coin for the native States rupees, bearing on one side whatever inscription or device they may prefer, but, on the other side, the head of the Sovereign of England; such rupees to be of the same intrinsic value as those which are called 'Company's rupees,' and the whole charge of the coinage to be borne by the British Government.\n\n\"9. The exaction of a provision to this effect is but a lenient penalty for the offences which the Ameers have committed, and to this I propose to add another, strongly recommended by you,\u2014a provision securing to us the right to cut wood upon both banks of the Indus for the use of the steamers.\n\n\"10. At the same time I know that, on the part of the Ameers, there will be more repugnance to this provision than to any other we could require; and I cannot but doubt whether it would not be found more economical to make use of coal imported from England, than of wood to be cut upon the banks of the Indus. However, for our own security, we must have this provision. It would be expedient to make it as little painful to the Ameers as possible, and to resort to the enforcement of the right to be conceded only in the event of their not furnishing, at the price and at the places to be fixed from time to time, the quantity of wood demanded by the officers of our Government.\n\n\"11. The lands we might demand as an equivalent for the tribute we are prepared to abandon, and those of which we may require the cession by Meer Roostum Khan and Meer Nusser Khan of Khyrpore, as the just penalties for their designed hostility, are in value beyond what are wanted for our own purposes; for it would be highly inexpedient for us to possess upon the Indus any larger extent of territory than may be sufficient to afford full security to the trade upon that river, and to give us the entire military command of it. It is to me a subject of great satisfaction that this circumstance will afford the means of conferring a great reward upon our most faithful ally and friend the Nawab of Bhawulpore.\"\nwas signed by those of Lower Sinde, amidst the clamours of a host of infuriated Belooches, who openly insulted the officers of\n\n\"12. I consider it to be a measure of true policy to shew to all the States of India, that while we punish the infraction of engagements, we reward fidelity; and it will be in our power, by compelling the cession to the Nawab, by Meer Roostum Khan and Meer Nusseer Mahomed Khan, of the pergunnas of Bhoong Bara and Subzulcote, which were wrested from Bhawulpore thirty-three years ago, to confer a favour the most gratifying to the Nawab and his people.\n\n\"13. It appears that the late Meer Moobaruck Khan possessed a very large portion of the fertile territory between Subzulcote and Rorce; and it might be desirable that this territory also should be ceded by Meer Nusseer Khan of Khrypore, his son, if he should now be in possession of it, to the Nawab of Bhawulpore, so that the dominion of the Nawab might extend to Rorce, and we might have one continued line of friendly territory on the left bank of the Sutlej and Indus from Ferozepore to Rorce. I am not, however, acquainted with the value of these pergunnas formerly belonging to Meer Moobaruck Khan, nor with their exact position; and it is possible that some of them, or all, may have been allotted to his other sons, and not to Meer Nusseer Khan, who alone, as far as I am informed, has placed himself in the position of an enemy by his conduct.\n\n\"14. If these pergunnas should belong to the late Meer Moobaruck Khan's other sons, the surplus tribute to be surrendered by us (in excess of the annual value of the lands to be demanded) may be made the means of compensation to the present possessors, the tribute being in all cases exchanged for land; for it is undesirable that there should be any payments of money to be made amongst the Ameers themselves. They are the constant source of dissension: and I have no wish to afflict them by the introduction of this perpetual element of quarrels into their family.\n\n\"15. I have already stated that I am desirous of confining the acquisitions of territory to be made by us to such as are necessary for the full protection of the trade upon the Indus and the military command of the river.\n\n\"16. These objects will be accomplished by the possession of Kurachee, Tatta, Sukkur, Bukkur, and Rorce, together with such arondissement as may be necessary for the secure and convenient occupation of the places, and to give ample room for the extension of the towns and cantonments.\n\n\"17. I have no information with respect to Tatta. At an early period of the Afghan war, it was considered desirable to have possession of it as the place of embarkation upon the Indus. It would, I conclude, be very valuable as a possession; and in any case it would be advisable to insert in any revised treaty, provisions not only securing to us the free use of that place of embarkation, but likewise the free use of the navigable creek between Kurachee, Tatta, and of the road from that creek to Tatta.\n\n\"18. I have not introduced into the Draft of Treaty, which I annex to this letter, any provisions for the entire freedom of the internal trade of Sinde, principally because I doubt the power of the Ameers, even if well disposed,\nthe British residency, and their servants. On the following day the residency was attacked, and its inmates were obliged to seek safety elsewhere.* Sir Charles Napier immediately advanced, to effect that object beyond the Indus; and further, because, even on the left bank of the Indus, it would be difficult for us to detect all the practical infractions of such a provision, and to enforce the observance of it.\n\n\"19. You may, however, bear in mind, that my ultimate object is the entire freedom of internal trade throughout the whole territory between Hindoo Koosh, the Indus, and the sea, and that I only await the favourable occasion for effecting this purpose, and for introducing uniformity of currency within the same limits.\n\n\"20. To these great benefits, to be enjoyed equally by 140 millions of people, I desire ultimately to add the abolition of all tributes payable by one State to another, and the substitution for such tributes of cessions of territory, so made, by means of mutual exchanges, as to bring together into masses the dominions of the several sovereigns and chiefs. These various measures, which would impart to the people of India the most considerable of the advantages derived from union under the same empire, it may require much time to effect; but it is desirable that they should always be held in view as the ultimate object of our policy, not inconsistent with the real independence of any State, and conducive to the happiness of the subjects of all.\"\n\n* The following is the account of this transaction given by the resident, Major Outram, to Sir Charles Napier:\n\n\"My despatches of the last few days will have led you to expect that my earnest endeavours to effect an amicable arrangement with the Ameers of Sinde would fail; and it is with much regret I have now to report that their highnesses have commenced hostilities by attacking my residence this morning, which, after four hours' most gallant defence by my honorary escort, the light company of her Majesty's 22nd regiment, commanded by Captain Conway, I was compelled to evacuate, in consequence of our ammunition running short.\n\n\"At 9 A.M. this morning, a dense body of cavalry and infantry took post on three sides of the agency compound (the fourth being defended by the Planet steamer, about 500 yards distant), in the gardens, and houses which immediately command the inclosure, and which it was impossible to hold with our limited numbers. A hot fire was opened by the enemy, and continued incessantly for four hours; but all their attempts to enter the agency inclosure, although merely surrounded by a wall varying from four to five feet high, were frustrated by Captain Conway's able distribution of his small band and the admirable conduct of every individual soldier composing it, under the gallant example of their commanding officer and his subalterns, Lieutenant Harding and Ensign Pennefather, her Majesty's 22nd regiment, also Captains Green, of the 21st regiment of Native Infantry, and Wells, of the 15th regiment, who volunteered their services, to each of whom was assigned the charge of a separate quarter; also to your aide-de-camp Captain Brown, Bengal Engineers, who carried my orders to the steamer, and assisted in work-\ngave battle to the enemy, and though the Belooches fought bravely, succeeded in achieving a signal victory\u2014a result greatly aided by the superiority of the arms of the British forces over those of their ing her guns and directing her flanking fire. Our ammunition being limited to forty rounds per man, the officers directed their whole attention to reserving their fire, and keeping their men close under cover, never shewing themselves or returning a shot, except when the enemy attempted to rush, or shewed themselves in great numbers, consequently great execution was done with trifling expenditure of ammunition and with little loss. Our hope of receiving a reinforcement and a supply of ammunition by the Satellite steamer (hourly expected) being disappointed, on the arrival of that vessel without either shortly after the commencement of the attack, it was decided at 12 A.M., after being three hours under fire, to retire to the steamer while still we had sufficient ammunition to fight the vessel up the river; accordingly I requested Captain Conway to keep the enemy at bay for one hour, while the property was removed, for which that time was ample, could the camp followers be induced to exert themselves. After delivering their first loads on board, however, they were so terrified at the enemy's cross-fire on the clear space between the compound and the vessel, that none could be persuaded to return, except a few of the officers' servants, with whose assistance but little could be removed during the limited time we could afford; consequently much had to be abandoned, and I am sorry to find that the loss chiefly fell upon the officers and men, who were too much occupied in keeping off the enemy to be able to attend to their own interests. Accordingly, after the expiration of another hour (during which the enemy, despairing of otherwise effecting their object, had brought up six guns to bear upon us), we took measures to evacuate the Agency. Captain Conway called in his posts, and all being united, retired in a body, covered by a few skirmishers, as deliberately as on parade (carrying off our slain and wounded), which, and the fire from the steam-boats, deterred the enemy from pressing on us as they might have done. All being embarked, I then directed Mr. Acting Commander Miller, commanding the Satellite steamer, to proceed with his vessel to the wood station, three miles up the river, on the opposite bank, to secure a sufficiency of fuel for our purposes ere it should be destroyed by the enemy, while I remained with the Planet to take off the barge that was moored to the shore. This being a work of some time, during which a hot fire was opened on the vessel from three guns which the enemy brought to bear on her, besides small arms, and requiring much personal exposure of the crew (especially of Mr. Cole, the commander of the vessel), I deem it my duty to bring to your favourable notice their zealous exertions on the occasion, and also to express my obligations to Messrs. Miller and Cole for the flanking fire they maintained on the enemy during their attack on the Agency, and for their support during the retirement and embarkation of the troops. The Satellite was also exposed to three guns in her progress up to the wood station, one of which she dismounted by her fire. The vessels were followed by large bodies for about three miles, occasionally opening their guns upon us to no purpose; since then we have pursued our voyage up the Indus, about fifteen\nopponents.* Triumph continued to attend the career of the victorious general. He was again successful in defeating the army of miles, without molestation, and purpose to-morrow morning anchoring off Muttaree, where I expect to find your camp. Our casualties amount to two men of her Majesty's 22nd regiment and one camp follower killed; and Mr. Conductor Kiely, Mr. Carlisle, agency clerk, two of the steamer's crew, four of her Majesty's 22nd regiment, two camp followers wounded, and four camp followers missing: total, three killed, ten wounded, and four missing.\"\n\n* Subjoined is the official report of the battle by Sir Charles Napier:\n\n\"The forces under my command have gained a decisive victory over the army of the Ameers of Upper and Lower Sinde. A detailed account of the various circumstances which led to this action does not belong to the limited space of a hasty despatch, I therefore begin with the transactions belonging to the battle. On the 14th instant, the whole body of the Ameers, assembled in full durbar, formally affixed their seals to the draft treaty. On leaving the durbar, Major Outram and his companions were in great peril: a plot had been laid to murder them all. They were saved by the guards of the Ameers; but the next day (the 15th) the residence of Major Outram was attacked by eight thousand of the Ameer's troops, headed by one or more of the Ameers. The report of this nefarious transaction I have the honour to inclose. I heard of it at Hala, at which place the fearless and distinguished Major Outram joined me, with his brave companions in the stern and extraordinary defence of his residence against so overwhelming a force, accompanied by six pieces of cannon. On the 16th I marched to Muttaree. Having there ascertained that the Ameers were in position at Meeanee (ten miles' distance), to the number of twenty-two thousand men, and well knowing that a delay for reinforcements would both strengthen their confidence and add to their numbers, already seven times that which I commanded, I resolved to attack them, and we marched at 4 A.M., on the morning of the 17th. At 8 o'clock the advanced guard discovered their camp; at 9 we formed in order of battle, about two thousand eight hundred men of all arms, and twelve pieces of artillery. We were now within range of the enemy's guns, and fifteen pieces of artillery opened upon us and were answered by our cannon. The enemy were very strongly posted; woods were on their flanks which I did not think could be turned. These two woods were joined by the dry bed of the river Fulaillee, which had a high bank. The bed of the river was nearly straight, and about 1,200 yards in length. Behind this and in both woods were the enemy posted. In front of their extreme right, and on the edge of the wood, was a village. Having made the best examination of their position, which so short a time permitted, the artillery was posted on the right of the line, and some skirmishers of infantry, with the Sinde irregular horse, were sent in front, to try and make the enemy shew his force more distinctly; we then advanced from the right in echelon of battalions, refusing the left, to save it from the fire of the village. The 9th Bengal light cavalry formed the reserve in rear of the left wing, and the Poona horse, together with four companies of infantry, guarded the baggage. In this order of battle we advanced, as at a review, across a fine plain, swept by the cannon of the enemy. The artillery, and\nthe Ameer of Meerpoor,* and the result was the complete subjugation of Sinde, and its annexation, with the exception of the her Majesty's 22nd regiment in line, formed the leading echelon, the 25th native infantry the second, the 12th native infantry the third, and the 1st grenadier native infantry the fourth.\n\n\"The enemy was a thousand yards from our line, which soon traversed the intervening space. Our fire of musketry opened at about a hundred yards from the bank, in reply to that of the enemy, and in a few minutes the engagement became general along the bank of the river, on which the combatants fought, for about three hours or more, with great fury, man to man. Then, my lord, was seen the superiority of the musket and bayonet over the sword and shield and matchlock. The brave Beloochees, first discharging their matchlocks and pistols, dashed over the bank with desperate resolution, but down went these bold and skilful swordsmen under the superior power of the musket and bayonet. At one time, my lord, the courage and numbers of the enemy against the 22nd, the 25th, and the 12th regiments, bore heavily in that part of the battle. There was no time to be lost, and I sent orders to the cavalry to force the right of the enemy's line. This order was very gallantly executed by the 9th Bengal cavalry and the Sinde horse, the details of which shall be afterwards stated to your lordship, for the struggle on our right and centre was, at that moment, so fierce, that I could not go to the left. In this charge the 9th light cavalry took a standard and several pieces of artillery, and the Sinde horse took the enemy's camp, from which a vast body of their cavalry slowly retired fighting. Lieutenant Fitzgerald gallantly pursued them for two miles, and, I understand, slew three of the enemy in single combat. The brilliant conduct of these two cavalry regiments decided, in my opinion, the crisis of the action, for, from the moment the cavalry were seen in the rear of their right flank, the resistance of our opponents slackened; the 22nd regiment forced the bank, the 25th and 12th did the same, the latter regiment capturing several guns, and the victory was decided. The artillery made great havoc among the dense masses of the enemy, and dismounted several of their guns. The whole of the enemy's artillery, ammunition, standards, and camp, with considerable stores and some treasure, were taken.\"\n\n* The following is an extract from Sir C. Napier's report of the battle:\n\n\"The forces under my command marched from Hyderabad this morning at daybreak. About half-past 8 o'clock we discovered and attacked the army under the personal command of the Meer Shere Mahomed, consisting of 20,000 men of all arms, strongly posted behind one of those large nullahs by which this country is intersected in all directions. After a combat of about three hours, the enemy was wholly defeated with considerable slaughter, and the loss of all his standards and cannon.\n\n\"His position was nearly a straight line; the nullah was formed by two deep parallel ditches, one 20 feet wide and 8 feet deep, the other 42 feet wide and 17 deep, which had been for a long distance freshly scarped, and a banquette made behind the bank expressly for the occasion.\n\n\"To ascertain the extent of his line was extremely difficult, as his left did\nterritory added to Bhawlpoor, to the British dominions. Such is the substance of the latest intelligence that has been received (March, 1844).\n\nSINH-KHA-BAB.\u2014See INDUS.\n\nSINZAVEE, in Afghanistan, a village on the gun-road not appear to be satisfactorily defined, but he began moving to his right when he perceived that the British force outflanked him in that direction. Believing that this movement had drawn him from that part of the nullah which had been prepared for defence, I hoped to attack his right with less difficulty, and Major Leslie's troop of horse artillery was ordered to move forward and endeavour to rake the nullah; the 9th light cavalry and Poona horse advancing in line, on the left of the artillery, which was supported on the right by her Majesty's 22nd regiment, the latter being, however, at first considerably retired to admit of the oblique fire of Leslie's troop. The whole of the artillery now opened upon the enemy's position, and the British line advanced in echelons from the left, her Majesty's 22nd regiment leading the attack.\n\n\"The enemy was now perceived to move from his centre in considerable bodies to his left, apparently retreating, unable to sustain the cross-fire of the British artillery; on seeing which, Major Stack, at the head of the 3rd cavalry, under command of Captain Delamain, and the Sinde horse, under command of Captain Jacob, made a brilliant charge upon the enemy's left flank, crossing the nullah, and cutting down the retreating enemy for several miles. While this was passing on the right, her Majesty's 22nd regiment, gallantly led by Major Poole, who commanded the brigade, and Captain George, who commanded the corps, attacked the nullah on the left with great gallantry, and, I regret to add, with considerable loss. This brave battalion marched up to the nullah under a heavy fire of matchlocks, without returning a shot till within forty paces of the entrenchment, and then stormed it like British soldiers. The intrepid Lieutenant Coote first mounted the rampart, seized one of the enemy's standards, and was severely wounded while waving it and cheering on his men. Meanwhile the Poona horse, under Captain Tait, and the 9th cavalry, under Major Story, turned the enemy's right flank, pursuing and cutting down the fugitives for several miles. Her Majesty's 22nd regiment was well supported by the batteries commanded by Captains Willoughby and Hutt, which crossed their fire with that of Major Leslie. Then came the 2nd brigade, under command of Major Woodburn, bearing down into action with excellent coolness. It consisted of the 25th, 21st, and 12th regiments, under the command of Captains Jackson, Stevens, and Fisher, respectively: these regiments were strongly sustained by the fire of Captain Whitlie's battery, on the right of which were the 8th and 1st regiments, under Majors Brown and Clibborn: these two corps advanced with the regularity of a review, up to the intrenchments, their commanders, with considerable exertion, stopping their fire, on seeing that a portion of the Sinde horse and 3rd cavalry, in charging the enemy, had got in front of the brigade. The battle was decided by the troop of horse artillery and her Majesty's 22nd regiment.\"\nfrom Dera Ghazee Khan to Kandahar, and one hundred and fifty miles west of the former place.

The north-west part of the town is the principal, and is situate on the right bank of the river; on the south-east and south is the suburb of Sher-Gerh, which has fortifications of no great strength, and contains the usual residence of the governor. This seat of government has two stories overtopping the ramparts and a principal entrance communicating with the river by broad wooden stairs. On the north of the city rises a hill, called the Kohi Maran, Hari Parbat, or Hirney Parvat, of trap formation, and having an elevation of about two hundred and fifty feet above the Jailum; on the summit is an ill-constructed fort of slight strength, though, according to H\u00fcgel, it might easily be made impregnable. On the edge of the cliff, which rises perpendicularly over the town, two or three large guns are mounted and command the city; the fortress itself has no cannon, being roofed over and having no embrasures. According to the statement of Vigne, the Mogul emperor, Akbar, caused a wall to be built round the base of the hill, a circuit of about four thousand paces. Of the five gates in this wall, one bears an inscription, stating that the tower Naginagur, thus inclosed, was built A.H. 1006, cost eleven millions of rupees.\n\n* From \u0633\u064f\u0631\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0652 \"the sun,\" and \u062a\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0643\u0652 \"a town.\"\n\n\u2020 According to H\u00fcgel, the Hindoos call it Sirinagur; the Mahometans, Kashmir.\nand that two hundred master-builders were employed on it. Of this great undertaking nothing remains but a handsome mosque, the rest has been reduced to a vast extent of shapeless ruins, at present totally uninhabited. Moorcroft draws a very repulsive picture of the city of Sirinagur. \"The general character of the city of Kashmir is that of a confused mass of ill-favoured buildings, forming a complicated labyrinth of narrow and dirty lanes, scarcely broad enough for a single cart to pass, badly paved, and having a small gutter in the centre, full of filth, banked upon each side by a border of mire. The houses are in general two or three stories high; they are built of unburnt bricks and timber, the former serving for little else than to fill up the interstices of the latter. They are not plastered, are badly constructed, and are mostly in a neglected and ruinous condition, with broken doors or no doors at all, with shattered lattices, windows stopped up with boards, paper, or rags, walls out of the perpendicular, and pitched roofs threatening to fall. The roofs are formed of layers of birch-bark covered by a coating of earth, in which seeds, dropped by birds or wafted by the wind, have vegetated, and they are constantly overrun with grass, flowers, and seeds. The houses of the better class are commonly detached and surrounded by a wall and gardens, the latter of which often communicate with a canal. The condition of the gardens is no better than that of the building, and the whole presents a striking picture of wretchedness and decay.\"\n\nThe public buildings of this city are not in much better style than the private dwellings. The oldest structure is the tomb of the mother of a Kashmirian king, who reigned in the middle of the fifteenth century. It is built, in an octagonal form, of brick, the walls being seven or eight feet thick, and surmounted by a dome constructed with great strength and solidity, but altogether devoid of architectural beauty. The Jama Musjid, or \"great mosque,\" is the most celebrated building of the city, and native estimate, which is probably exaggerated, represents it capable of containing sixty thousand persons. The foundation and lower part of the walls are built of stone, the upper of brick. The whole is surmounted by a dome and spire rudely constructed of timber, and partly supported on pillars of the same materials, and of these there are three hundred and eighty-four.* Every pillar is a\n\n* There is a most extraordinary and unaccountable variance between this\npile of square deodar logs, each about a foot thick, and laid one over another as beams are usually stored in a timber-yard, so that each face presents a succession of butts and sides. These pillars are about ten feet high, and seem to have been devised with a precautionary view against earthquakes, which are here of frequent occurrence, and have damaged the rest of the structure without shaking them, or causing them to deviate from the perpendicular. The deodar is a timber so durable that though these pillars have stood nearly two centuries, they exhibit no symptoms of decay.\n\nThe ground-plan of this spacious building is a square of about four hundred feet. The mosque of Shah Hamedan is built of deodar in a singular style of architecture, resembling the Chinese, but less fantastic and meretricious. The Jailum is crossed by seven bridges. The piers of these are formed of deodar logs, arranged as in the pillars of the great mosque, the road being formed by beams of the same timber stretching from one pier to another. There are no parapets nor side-rails of any kind, and as the beams are in most places some distance asunder, the passage of these singular bridges is not altogether free from danger. So durable is the material, so gentle the current of the Jailum, and so exempt the climate of Kashmir from storms, that some of these apparently frail structures have lasted for several centuries. Houses are built on some of them, and in many places trees have spontaneously grown up. Close to the east of Sirinagur is the city Dal, or Lake, described by Vigne as five miles in length from north to south, and two and a half miles in breadth from east to west. The water is very clear and not deep, in few places exceeding eight or ten feet. The lake is divided into two nearly equal parts by an artificial causeway made across it in the direction from south-west to north-east. This is covered with rushes, and has the appearance of a green line traversing the water. A single opening, bridged over, admits the passage of\n\n\"The foundations are of stone, but the roof of the surrounding cloister, or interior, is supported by two rows of pillars, three hundred and ninety-two in all, on plain stone bases, each pillar being formed of a single deodar-tree, about thirty feet in height.\" In attempting to decide between such discordant statements, it should be borne in mind that Vigne was an eye-witness, and that the work styled Moorcroft's Travels is a compilation from materials which the learned r\u00e9dacteur was \"compelled to compress unmercifully.\"\n\n---\n\n1 ii. 81.\n2 Wilson in Pref. to Moorer, liii.\nboats from one part of the lake to the other. Various tongues of land divide the Dal into inlets or basins, which have distinctive names. It is supplied with water by a stream called the Tybul, but which descends from the mountains bounding the valley on the north-east. This beautiful lake communicates with the Jailum by a canal having floodgates, which remain open when the current sets from the lake towards the river. During inundations of the Jailum, the floodgates are closed by the first rush of water towards the lake, which is thus prevented from overflowing the lower part of the city. That part of the city situate between the Jailum and lake is in several places intersected by canals, which, with proper care, would serve important commercial purposes and contribute to salubrity and cleanliness, but in their present neglected state they must rather be classed amongst the deformities and disadvantages of this fallen city.\n\nThe Mar canal is described by Vigne as a singular monument of the ancient prosperity of the city. \"Boats pass along as at Venice. Its narrowness, for it does not exceed thirty feet in width; its walls of massive stone; its heavy single-arch bridges and landing-places of the same material; the gloomy passages leading down upon it, betoken the greatest antiquity, whilst the lofty and many-storied houses that rise directly from the water, supported only by thin trunks of deodar, seem ready to fall down upon the boats with every gust of wind. It could not but remind me of one of the old canals in Venice, and, although far inferior in architectural beauty, is perhaps not without pretensions to equal singularity.\" The verdant and level margin of this beautiful piece of water was the favourite resort of the Mogul emperors and their courtiers, and is still in many places overspread with the relics of their pleasure-grounds and palaces. Of these, the most celebrated is the Shahlimar, where Moore's imagination has pictured the closing scene of Nalla Rookh. This pleasure-ground, laid down by the emperor Jehan Gir, is shaded by noble chunars, or plane-trees, now, from age, verging to decay. It is, according to Vigne, seven or eight hundred yards in length by two hundred and eighty in breadth.* The principal building is placed at the upper end of this inclosure, and is thus described by Vigne in rather singular terms:\u2014\"It is of\n\n* According to H\u00fcgel, three hundred and seventy-six paces long, and two hundred and twenty broad.\npolished black marble, and consisting of two rooms on either side of a passage, which runs through the centre of the building. On the east and west sides of it there is a corridor, six and a half yards wide, formed by a range of six polygonal pillars, about thirteen feet in height, and of the same material. They are said to have been taken from the ruins of a Hindoo temple, but the capitals and bases appear to have been the work of a Mahomedan architect, and the latter in particular are most beautifully scalloped and polished. The building itself is twenty-four yards square, the north and south sides being ornamented with Saracenic reliefs. It stands in the centre of a square reservoir, which is also lined with black marble, whose sides are about fifty-four yards long, and in its whole circumference, contains one hundred and forty-seven fountains, which are made to play on holidays, the reservoir being filled by the stream, which enters it in the shape of a cascade. The height from the stone floor to the roof is about twenty feet. The latter may originally have been pointed like the Tuscan roof, but as it is now covered with thatch, its original shape cannot be determined. The stream thence descends from the reservoir by a shallow canal cut through the centre of the gardens, and lined with marble, and it falls over an artificial cascade at each of the three lodges through which it passes in its way to the lake. A broad causeway, or walk, runs on each side of it, overshadowed by large chunar-trees, and here and there, a few turfed walks branch off at right angles into the shrubberies, in which are little else than wild plum-trees, planted for the sake of their white blossoms. At the end of one of these is a decayed bath, built of brick, and the walls around are covered with ivy.\u201d The view of the lake from the vicinity of the city is very beautiful, the entrance lying between two striking eminences\u2014Huri Parbut on the west, and on the east the Tukhti Suliman, of greater elevation and more imposing aspect. Between these, a magnificent crescent of mountains rises on the north, the east, and south-east, and on the north-west the huge summit of Haramuk towers in the distance with great grandeur. The foreground is formed by the expanse of the clear water of the lake, in many places mantling with the rich green leaves and brilliant blossoms of the water-lily (*Nelumbium speciosum*), and studded with green islets, in many instances tufted with trees. The beauty of this delightful scene is heightened by the appearance of the shore, teeming with the\nrichest verdure, and ornamented with groves of noble plane-trees and poplars. The floating gardens, formed of matted reeds, weeds, and sedge, overlaid with earth, and bearing abundant crops of melons and cucumbers, though on account of their singularity attracting the notice of the traveller, form no feature in the landscape, being at a short distance nearly undistinguishable from the contiguous bank. The scene is, however, enlivened by the numerous boats employed in taking the fish with which the lake abounds. Formerly many persons lived by taking the countless water-fowl which frequent the lake, but these are now unmolested, in consequence of the strictly enforced orders of the Sikh rulers. The appearance of the antique city falling piecemeal into ruin, when viewed at some distance, is no unpleasing feature in the prospect. \"The aspect of the city itself is curious, but not particularly striking.\" It presents an innumerable assemblage of gable-ended houses, interspersed with the pointed and metallic tops of musjis or mosques, melon-grounds, sedgy inlets from the lake, and narrow canals, fringed with rows of willows and poplars. The surface of the lake itself is perfectly tranquil, and the very vivid reflections which cover its surface are only disturbed by the dabbling of wild-fowl, or the rippling that follows the track of the distant boat.\" In the more prosperous ages of Kashmir, this lake was the scene of the frequent pleasure-parties of the volatile and voluptuous Kashmirians. According to Forster, \"when a Kashmirian, even of the lowest order, finds himself in the possession of a few shillings, he loses no time in assembling his party, and, launching into the lake, solaces himself until the last farthing is spent.\" This fondness for festive pleasures is especially displayed at the \"Feast of Roses,\" which flowers are produced in Kashmir of unrivalled beauty and fragrance. \"The season when the rose first opens into blossom is celebrated with much festivity by the Kashmirians, who resort in crowds to the adjacent gardens, and enter into scenes of gaiety and pleasure rarely known among other Asiatic nations.\" As oppression and consequent misery have \"frozen the genial current of the soul,\" in the Kashmirians, that romantic festival has degenerated into the feast of Singaras or water-nuts, celebrated on the first of May by ascending to the summit of the Tukhti Suliman and feasting there, \"eating more particularly of singaras.\" Sirinagur was formerly much celebrated for its manufacture of\nshawls, paper, leather, firearms, and attar of rose,* but these have nearly disappeared under the cruel oppression which has long crushed the energies of a people naturally ingenious, industrious, and persevering. Notwithstanding the notorious pusillanimity of the Kashmirians, the Sikhs, conscious of the hatred with which they are regarded, maintain a garrison of about fourteen hundred men, to coerce the miserable population of Sirinagur, computed by some not to exceed forty thousand persons. Moorcroft, who visited the city in 1823, estimated the population at two hundred and forty thousand; the judicious and cautious Elphinstone, in the early part of the present century, at \"from a hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand.\" This appalling reduction of the population in so brief a period has been the combined effect of oppression, pestilence, and famine.\u2020 Sirinagur is generally considered to have been founded by Pravarasena, who reigned in Kashmir from A.D. 128 to 176. It is supposed to have succeeded to a more ancient city of the same name, the ruins of which are conjectured by some to be observable at Wentipur,\u2021 by others at Matan. The elevation of Sirinagur above the sea has been the subject of much controversy, though stated by several intelligent Europeans who have resided at the city for a considerable time, and made this point the specific object of their notice. There can be little doubt that it exceeds 5,000 feet, and falls below 6,000, and 5,500 may be taken as the mean and probable amount.

Its course lies in general north for about thirty miles, to the summit near which it debouches into the route by the Koushan Pass. The elevation of the summit must be very considerable, as in the beginning of November it was found impassable from snow by Lord and Wood, though a few days after they succeeded in making their way over the Hageguk Pass, 12,000 feet above the level of the sea.

It is situate at the northern extremity of an inlet, called the Bay of Sonmeanee, and described, probably in too favourable terms, by Pottinger, as \"a very noble sheet of water, said to be free from rocks or shoals, and is capable of affording anchorage to the largest fleet.\" This bay is formed by the projection of Cape Monze on the east. According to the competent authority of Carless, \"the harbour, which has been formed by the Poorally river, is a large irregular inlet, spreading out, like that of Kurrachee, in extensive swamps, and choked with shoals. The channel leading into it is extremely narrow, and has a depth of sixteen or seventeen feet at high water in the shallowest part, but it shifts its position every year,\n\n* According to Hart, from \u0633\u0648 su, \"neat,\" and meanee, signifying, in Sindhi, \"a fishing station.\"\nand vessels of any size could not navigate it without great difficulty until it has been buoyed off inside. There are six or seven, or even ten, fathoms in some places, but towards the town the channels become shallow, and the trading boats cannot approach it nearer than a mile. At the spot where they anchor, they are always aground at low water. During the south-west monsoon the harbour cannot be entered, for the bar at the entrance is exposed to the whole force of the swell, and the breakers on it are heavy.\" This bar, according to Horsburgh, has two fathoms of water when the tide is out, but the depth is every year diminishing, and will probably be soon too little to admit vessels; at the same time the sea is encroaching on the land, and threatens soon to sweep away the present site of the town. Sea-going vessels, in general, anchor outside the bar, at the distance of about two miles from the town, and are much exposed to the sea and the weather. The cargoes are discharged into small boats, and so landed. Horses for exportation are made to swim to the vessels. The town is mean and dirty, and has about five hundred houses, built of mud, and each surmounted by a badger, or small turret or flue, open on one side to the sea-breeze, which it sends downwards in the interior of the building, for the purpose of mitigating the excessive heat. It was formerly surrounded by a mud wall, which is now so decayed that scarcely a vestige of it remains. Water can be obtained only by digging in the sand a little above high-water mark, and is so brackish as to be scarcely drinkable, insomuch that the British vessels, when stationed here, were supplied from Kurrachee. The inhabitants live principally by fishing, and are extremely poor, except a few Hindoos, who have the whole trade in their hands. The imports from Bombay are silk, cloths, iron, tin, steel, copper, pepper, sugar, and spices; from the Persian Gulf, dates and slaves; from Sinde, coarse cotton cloths. The exports are horses, butter, wool, hides, oil, grain, dried fruits, and gum. In 1808 this place was burned by Arabian pirates, and the trade has much decayed since that time. Its traffic is at present much injured by the predatory Belooches, who interrupt the communication with the interior. The population is estimated by Carless at about two thousand.

The route from Ghuznee to Shawl proceeds up its course nearly to its source.

The Soorkh Rood rises on the northern slope of the Sufeid Koh, or White Mountains, and receives numerous streams, so that, though neither deep nor broad, it is a very rapid river, with a violent current. It was forded by a British party at Hissatuck in June, 1838. The water at that place was then stirrup-high, and the stream about two yards wide. It is crossed, in lat. 34\u00b0 19', long. 69\u00b0 56', by the route from Kabool to Jelalabad, by means of \"a bridge, built by Ali Mardan Khan in the reign of Shah Jehan, A.D. 1606, but recently repaired by Akram Khan.

The Sufeid Koh range runs nearly east and west along the parallel of lat. $33^\\circ 50'$, commencing eastward near Attock in long. $72^\\circ 16'$, and terminating westward in long. $69^\\circ 36'$. Its western extremity sinks into a maze of hills, stretching like net-work to the Kohistan of Kabool. The Sufeid Koh is generally of primary formation, consisting of granite, quartz, gneiss, mica, slate, and primary limestone. There are three ranges running nearly parallel, and rising in height as they recede from the river; the two lower are covered with pine forests; the highest and most distant has a very irregular outline, is steep and very rocky, yet furrowed by many beautiful and fertile vales. The highest part is between the meridians of $69^\\circ 40'$ and $70^\\circ 30'$, and attains the elevation of 14,100 feet, being covered with perpetual snow. The Soorkh Rood, the Kara Su, and many other shallow but impetuous streams, rush down its northern face, and are discharged into the river of Kabool, which conveys their water to the Indus.

It is situate where a low limestone range slopes down to the river's bank, clothed in the neighbourhood of the town with luxuriant groves of date-palms. These groves, combined with the ruined but picturesque town of Sukkur, the river, the huge fortress of Bukkur, and the town of Roree, situated on the bold precipice opposite, form a very noble landscape. In 1839, a British cantonment was made at Sukkur, which, for a time, became converted from a scene of desolation and wretchedness to one of activity and prosperity. Sukkur has still a few towers, mosques, and minarets standing. One minaret is in a state of considerable preservation, and, according to Kennedy, is a hundred feet high, and may be ascended by a winding stone staircase, affording access to the summit, whence is a noble prospect. It is a heavy, ill-proportioned column, without ornament. The population of Sukkur is stated by Hough to be about 500. Burnes states it to be half of that of Roree, and estimates this last at 8,000. There can be no reasonable doubt that the actual number considerably exceeds the estimate by Hough. Lat. 27\u00b0 44', long. 68\u00b0 52'.\n\nSUKYT, in the Punjab, a small town nearly midway between the Beas and Sutluj, and on the route from Bilaspur to Mundi. It is situate in the valley of Sukyt-Mundi, eight or ten miles long, three or four broad, fertile, well watered, and highly cultivated, down the middle of which the river of Sukyt flows northward, and falls into the Beas. Vigne observes that \"perhaps no country of equal extent could boast of so many strongholds.\" Lat. 31\u00b0 32', long. 76\u00b0 52'.\n\nSULDERA, in the Punjab, a small town on the route from Ferozpoor to Mooltan, and in the Doab of Barie.

This summit does not enter within the limit of perpetual congelation, being devoid of snow during the height of summer. Of its geological structure scarcely anything is known. Vigne, almost the only European who has visited this range, only states that \"it consists of recent formations, principally sandstone and secondary limestone, abounding in ammonites and other marine exuviae, the strata being much shattered and contorted, and often overlaid by shingle.\" The eastern declivity dips rather steeply to the valley of the Indus, giving rise to numerous water-courses, which fertilize the Derajat, and are expended by absorption or irrigation. The western declivity is much more gradual to the desert table-land of Sewestan. It is remarkable that no stream rising in this range is known to reach the sea in any direction, or by any channel, except the Kurum, which discharges a scanty volume of water into the Indus, above Kala Bagh. The greatest dimension of the range is from north to south, and is a little more than three hundred miles. The Suliman range is generally considered the peculiar seat of the aboriginal Afghans. Nowhere is vegetation more vigorous and varied. The sides of the mountain nearly to the summit are clothed with dense and lofty forests, and the valleys overgrown with a great variety of indigenous trees, shrubs, and flowers.\n\nSULLEEANEE, in the Punjab, a small town of the Doab of Barie, on the route from Surrukpore to Ferozpoor, and about half-way between the Ravee and Ghara.

Walker, in his elaborate and valuable map of \"the countries between the Sutluj and Oxus,\" notes the elevation as 12,000; probably thinking it least objectionable to state a mean between two authorities, each so eminent, yet in this instance so widely differing.\nthe residence of the rajah; and north of this, and separated from it by a small bazaar, is the upper part of the town, consisting of the houses of traders, shopkeepers, and artificers. The principal imports are chintzes, coarse cottons, and woollens, and the returns are made in opium and musk, the traffic being conducted by wandering mendicants, of whom great numbers arrive here on their route to various places of pilgrimage in the mountains. The place is, as Moorcroft observes, \"of no great population or extent.\" Lat. 32\u00b0 7', long. 77\u00b0 2'.\n\nSULTANPOOR, in Afghanistan, a small town west of Jelalabad on the route to Kabool, is celebrated for its fine springs, gardens, and orchards.

A little lower down a canal proceeds from the left side of the Jailum to the west, in which direction it extends about ten miles to Sopur, thus avoiding the navigation of Lake Wulur during inundations or tempestuous weather. Sumbul is distinguishable at a great distance by its lofty grove of trees. The Jailum opposite the village is about a hundred yards wide, and six or eight feet deep, and is crossed by a large bridge built of deodars in the usual Kashmirian style. Sumbul is in lat. 34\u00b0 11', long. 74\u00b0 30'.\n\nSUMMA KA BUSTEE, in Sinde, a village situate on the\nroute from Hyderabad to Omercote, nine miles west of the latter place.

It is situate about a mile from the right or north-western bank of the Urghundab, here generally fordable, being about forty yards wide and from two to three feet deep. As the current is very rapid, the ford cannot safely be attempted when the depth exceeds\nthree feet. The surrounding country is very fertile, being irrigated by numerous watercourses from the river.

The summit of the ridge is dreary, rocky, and devoid both of vegetation and water. Surtaf is in lat. 29\u00b0 11', long. 69\u00b0 5'.\n\nSURWOD.\u2014A village situate on the northern frontier of Cutch Gundava, on the circuitous route from Bagh to Kahun. Lat. 29\u00b0 21', long. 68\u00b0 30'.\n\nSUTLEDGE.\u2014See SUTLUJ.\n\nSUTLUJ.\u2014The most easterly of the rivers of the Punjab. It does not appear that its source has been visited by any European, in consequence of their vigilant exclusion by the Chinese, within whose territory it lies. Moorcroft, in his journey to Manas Sarowur, seems to have approached nearest to the source, having, about lat. 31\u00b0, long. 80\u00b0 40', come upon the Sutoodra or Sutluj. Lloyd and Gerard, who with Moorcroft have done more for the geography of this region than any others, give the following account: \"The most remote source of the Sutluj is said by my informants to be at a place named Chomik Tongdol, where a small stream gushes out of the ground and runs into Goongeoo Lake. This place must be very much elevated, for, allowing a moderate fall for the river, it will come out 19,000 or 20,000 feet more than Lake Man Sarowur, which I think I have pretty good data for estimating at 17,000 above the sea.\" This spot is, in the map of the authors just quoted, placed in lat. 31\u00b0 5', long. 81\u00b0 6', and appears to be on the south side of the Kailas, or \"Peaked Mountain,\" on the north of which the Indus is thought to have its source. From this point it takes its course to Rawan Hrad, or Goongeoo Lake, situate close to that of Manas Sarovara, and supposed by some to receive its waters. It subsequently issues from the north-western extremity of this lake, being there in the dry season thirty feet broad, and takes a north-westerly course of about one hundred and fifty miles, through a country of awful and even terrific sublimity, as far as Nako, in lat. 31\u00b0 50', long. 78\u00b0 36'. Close to this it receives the river of Spiti from the north-west. Above the confluence, the Sutluj is seventy-five feet wide; its bed 8,600 feet above the level of the sea. Gerard observes, \"It is not easy to form an estimate of the water contained in the Sutluj, for although the breadth can be determined, yet within the mountains there is scarcely a possibility of\nsounding it, on account of its great rapidity.\" The depth at this spot must be very great, as the volume of water is considerable even eighty miles further up, where, at Ling, the river is too broad to admit of a rope-bridge, and is crossed by one of iron chains: the breadth thereabouts being one hundred and twenty yards; the depth, at the lowest season, one foot and a half; the rapidity seven or eight miles an hour; the impetus of the stream such as that it can be forded only by yaks or Tartarian kine if the depth exceed two feet. The bed of the river, a short distance below this, in lat. 32\u00b0 38', long. 79\u00b0 4', is 10,792 feet above the sea. Here the river is by the natives called Langzhing-Khampa, or the river of Langzhing; lower down, Muksung; then, Sampoo; lower still, Zeung-tee; lower down, Sumeedrung; in Busehar, Sutoodra, or \"hundred-channeled,\" whence the names Zadadrus and Hesudrus of the classical writers; lower down, it is generally called the Sutluj, by which name it is also known up to its source. Though the river is in the upper part of its course a raging torrent, falling in several places a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet per mile, with a clamorous noise, and displaying heaps of white foam, yet so severe is the climate that for two hundred miles it is completely frozen for two months every winter. Where not fordable, it is crossed either by a sango, or wooden bridge; by a jhoola, or rope-bridge, which the traveller passes on a seat suspended by a loop made to slide along the rope, by means of a long string, pulled by men stationed on the further bank; or by means of a suzum, or foot-bridge, formed of cables, stretched parallel to each other. These frail suspension-bridges frequently give way, and the passengers are dashed to pieces. There are also a few chain bridges. At the confluence of the Spiti and Sutluj, the bed of the river is 8,494 feet above the sea. The scene is described as awfully sublime; according to Lloyd and Gerard, \"the character of the gulf at the confluence is certainly one of the wonders of the world.\" The Lee, or river of Spiti, issues forth from a rocky channel, so narrow and deep as almost to seem subterranean, with a calm blue deep current. The Sutluj is muddy and breaks violently on the rocks with a tremendous roaring. The Spiti has probably a larger body of water than the Sutluj. The former river averages from two hundred and fifty to three hundred feet in breadth; the latter, a short distance above the confluence,\nis seventy-five feet broad. Below the confluence, the stream is so deep and rapid that no bottom could be found with a ten-pound sounding lead. From this remarkable point its general course is south-west, with a very rapid declivity. At Namptoo (lat. $32^\\circ 45'$, long. $78^\\circ 36'$), the height of its bed is 8,220 feet, its breadth 106; at Wangtoo (lat. $32^\\circ 32'$, long. $78^\\circ 1'$) the height of its bed is 5,200 feet, the breadth is 92; at Rampoor (lat. $32^\\circ 26'$, long. $77^\\circ 38'$), the height of the bed is 3,360, the width 211. These measurements were made at the narrowest places, where bridges have been constructed, but in other places it is 150 yards wide. From Rampoor to Bilaspoor, in lat. $31^\\circ 21'$, long. $76^\\circ 41'$, its course is generally west-south-west. Forster, who crossed it here, describes it as a very rapid stream, about one hundred yards broad. Hence it holds a very tortuous course, but in general west-south-west to Ropoor, lat. $30^\\circ 58'$, long. $76^\\circ 29'$, where it makes its way through the low sandstone range of Jhejwan, and enters the plain of the Punjab. It is here thirty feet deep and more than five hundred yards wide in its season of greatest fulness, and is crossed either in boats or on floats of inflated buffaloes. As is the case with all the rivers descending from the Himalaya, it is far fullest in June, July, and August. At the ferry of Filor, or Faloor, in lat. $31^\\circ$, long. $75^\\circ 51'$, it was found, in the season when lowest, to be two hundred and fifty yards wide, seven feet deep, and moderately rapid. Burnes, who crossed it here in August, when fullest, found it seven hundred yards wide, with a depth, where greatest, of eighteen feet, but on an average of only twelve. Up to this point it is navigable at all seasons for vessels of ten or twelve tons burthen. Its confluence with the Beas is a little above Hurekee, and in lat. $31^\\circ 11'$, long. $74^\\circ 54'$. According to Macartney, the Beas has the larger body of water. Gerard appears to over-estimate, by seventy or eighty miles, the distance which it runs from the source to the confluence with the Beas. According to his statement, \"the whole length of the Sutlej thus far is five hundred and seventy miles, four hundred and forty of which lie within the mountains.\" Below this confluence, as far as the confluence of the Chenaub, the united stream bears the name of Ghara. From about thirty miles above Rampoor to the frontier of Bhawlpore, a distance of about three hundred and fifty miles, the continuous streams, Ghara and Sutluj, form the north-west\nboundary of the British territories. As before mentioned, the Sutluj is considered to be the Zaradrus, Zadadrus, or Hesudrus of the ancients, and the Hypanis mentioned by Strabo.\n\nSUTTA WALLA.\u2014A village in that part of Afghanistan called Daman, situated on the banks of the Indus. Lat. 32\u00b0 42', long. 71\u00b0 26'.\n\nSUWAT, on the north-eastern frontier of Afghanistan, a secluded territory very little explored, extending west of the upper part of the Indus to the Lundye, or river of Panjkora. It is said to be a very fine country, fertile, well watered, and notwithstanding its elevated position on the southern slope of Hindoo Koosh, possessing a good climate. The inhabitants, a semi-civilized race, are fanatical Mahometans, though not very well acquainted with the tenets of the religion they profess. They are partly Eusufzai Afghans, who are the ruling race, and partly indigenous Swatis, reduced by the former to a state of helotism. Dhyr, the residence of the chief, is said to have a population of about 3,000. It is watered by the river Suwat, which, rising in the Hindoo Koosh, takes a south-westerly course, and falls into the Lundye, or river of Panjkora, in lat. 34\u00b0 42', long. 71\u00b0 48'. In the reign of Akbar, Suwat formed part of the Mogul empire, being a sircar, or subdivision of the subah, or government of Kashmir.\n\nSUYUD BUKAS, in Sinde, a village situate on the left bank of the Narra river, on the route from Bukkur to Omercote.

It holds a south-westerly course of a hundred and twenty miles, and falls into the Indus on the left side, about ten miles below Mukkud, and in lat. 33\u00b0, long. 71\u00b0 46'. Elphinstone, who crossed it in lat. 33\u00b0 37', long. 73\u00b0 3', and about thirty miles from its source, describes it to be, where forded, \"a large rivulet, which, though only up to our horses' girths, was so rapid as to be scarcely fordable. Several of our camels were swept down by the stream.\" Hough, who crossed the Swan when the water was low, describes it as having \"a stony bed, not broad, and one foot of water.\" Burnes, who crossed this stream in lat. 33\u00b0 6', long. 72\u00b0 12', found it there \"rapid, red, and swollen,\" and stirrup-deep.\nSYADABAD, in Afghanistan, on the route from Ghuznee to Kabool, and fifty-four miles south of the latter town.

Lat. $35^\\circ 54'$, long. $64^\\circ 23'$.\n\nTAK, in Afghanistan, a thriving town of the Derajat, situate north of Dera Ismael Khan, and twenty-six miles west of the Indus. It is surrounded by a strong and high mud wall, surmounted by towers; within is a citadel of burnt brick, having a high tower at each of the four corners, and mounted with twelve pieces of cannon. It has some transit trade, being situate on a route from east to west, which crosses the Suliman range to the north of the Goolairee Pass. The surrounding country is fertile and populous, being crowded with good villages, but it is not healthy, the heat in summer being intense, and the water bad. The Afghan khan or chief has a revenue of about 150,000 rupees per annum, on which he lives in petty state, though obliged to pay the Sikhs a tribute of 60,000 rupees annually. Tak is celebrated for fine fruits, grapes, oranges, pomegranates, apples, and especially mulberries.

All the information existing respecting this place is due to Court, who ascertained from native report that amidst its massive and immense ruins exists an enormous cupola of elaborate architecture, embellished around its base with a number of basso relievos. Lat. $34^\\circ 56'$, long. $71^\\circ 58'$.\n\nTALAFRU.\u2014A village in the Punjab, situate on the route from Doda to Chumba, in lat. $32^\\circ 42'$, long. $75^\\circ 7'$.\n\nTALEE.\u2014A village of Sewestan, in Afghanistan, on the road from Dadur to Tull.

The surrounding country is singularly rugged and difficult. Hough observes, \"When you got on the table-land, you looked back on the most frightful ravines ever seen,\" and considers the country worse than the most dreaded passes of Afghanistan.

Lat. $31^\\circ 8'$, long. $71^\\circ 54'$.\n\nTANDI, in the Punjab, a village of the district of Lahoul, is situate at the point where a considerable feeder of the Chenaub falls into that river, which immediately below the confluence is two hundred feet wide, with a steady current. Here are a store and office belonging to the ruler of Kulu, and appointed for the receipt of the revenue, which he derives in grain from Lahoul. The vicinity is wooded, producing pines, yews, and willows. Buck-wheat is the principal crop, though barley and wheat are cultivated, but the great elevation, probably exceeding 8,000 feet, and consequent lowness of temperature, frequently render the crops of these two last sorts of grain abortive. Lat. $30^\\circ 41'$, long. $74^\\circ 56'$.\n\nTANGEE TURKAI, in Afghanistan, a very difficult pass, cast of and close to Khurd Kabool, on the southern route, through the Kurkutcha range of mountains, between Kabool and Jelalabad. Here, on the disastrous attempt made by the British to retreat from Kabool in 1842, they were nearly all massacred, so that the remnant was disabled from making any further resistance. This pass is about eighteen miles south-east of Kabool. Lat. $34^\\circ 51'$, long. $69^\\circ 20'$.\n\nTARA.\u2014A village of Sinde, on the road from Tattah to Meerpoor, twelve miles south-west of the former place. Lat. $24^\\circ 41'$, long. $67^\\circ 50'$.\n\nTARIANA.\u2014A village situate in the south-eastern desert of Sinde, sixty miles south-east of Omercote, on the route to Nuggur Parker. Lat. $24^\\circ 50'$, long. $70^\\circ 33'$.\n\nTATARA PASS, in Afghanistan, through the Khyber mountains, between Jelalabad, is north of the Khyber Pass. It leaves the route through the Khyber Pass a little east of Jamrood, takes a circuit to the north, and rejoins it at Duka, its western termination. It is very difficult, being scarcely practicable for cavalry, yet of great importance, as, if left undefended, it affords a means of turning the Khyber Pass. In the commencement of 1842, when the Khyber Pass was closed, communication was frequently effected by the Tatara Pass, between Peshawer and Jelalabad. The Tatara Pass is in lat. $34^\\circ 10'$, long. $71^\\circ 20'$.\n\nTATTA, in Sinde, a town formerly very famous, but now much\ndecayed, is situated about three miles west of the right or western bank of the Indus, and four miles above the point where the Buggaur or western, and the Sata or eastern, branches of the river separate. Its site is consequently close to the vertex of the delta of the Indus, the channel of which is here about a mile and a quarter wide, with a muddy stream, in the low season occupying only a third of this space. The present city is built on a slight eminence, composed of the rubbish of former buildings, in an alluvial valley at the foot of the Mukali hills. It is in consequence exceedingly unhealthy. The British troops stationed here in 1839 suffered dreadful loss from diseases, resulting from the pestilential air and bad water, which last is not only unwholesome, but fetid and offensive to the senses.\n\nThe town appears to have been formerly insulated by the water of the Indus, and is still nearly so during the season of inundation; when this passes away it leaves numerous stagnant pools which infect the air. Dr. Burnes states that it was once thirty miles in circuit, judging no doubt from the vast space in the vicinity overspread by tombs and ruins; but these are with much probability considered by Wood to be the relics of successive cities, built on various but contiguous sites, to avoid the ravages, or take advantage of the navigation, of the shifting currents of the Indus. These extensive ruins are scattered from Peer Puttah, about ten miles south of Tatta, to Sami-Nuggur, three miles north-west of it. The ruins of the great fortress of Kulancote shew it to have been constructed with much labour and skill, in a massive style of building. \"The vast cemetery of six square miles,\" observes Kennedy, \"may not contain less than a million of tombs\u2014a rude guess\u2014but the arca would admit of four millions.\" In these ruins the masonry and carving, both in brick and stone, display great taste, skill, and industry. The bricks especially are of the finest sort, nearly equalling porcelain. Kennedy observes, \"The finest-chiselled stone could not surpass the sharpness of edge and angle, and accuracy of form.\" Tatta, viewed at some distance from the outside, presents a very striking and picturesque appearance, as its lofty houses rise over the numerous acacias and other trees, everywhere interspersed, and which, says Kennedy, \"formed altogether as fine a picture of city scenery as I remember to have seen in India.\" But the illusion is dissipated on entering the town, where the houses are everywhere falling into\nruin, to which they are prone, being constructed for the most part of a timber frame-work,\\(^1\\) on the outside of which are nailed laths, which are plastered over with mud of a grey colour, so as when new to have the appearance of a solid wall of masonry.\\(^2\\) These structures are sometimes three or four stories high, and covered with flat roofs of earth. From the fragility of the materials they can last but a short time, and this work of ruin is continually in progress in the town. All the houses are surmounted by badges,\\(^3\\) *a sort of ventilator, built somewhat in the shape of a windsail, and conveying, even in the most sultry weather, a current of cool and refreshing air. The appearance of the town is mournful. The streets are deserted, the bazaars in ruins, and every thing indicates depression and poverty; the inhabitants are dirty, squalid, and of unhealthy appearance.\\(^4\\) The only building worth notice is the brick-built mosque of Shah Jehan, itself crumbling into ruins. Of the decayed manufactures of Tatta, the principal is that of loongees, a thick, rich, and variegated fabric, having a warp of silk and a woof of cotton,\\(^5\\) with (in the more costly kinds) much gold thread interwoven. The silk is imported from Persia, Kabool, and Turkestan; the cotton from Eastern India. The number of persons employed in this manufacture at present is not more than one hundred. Coarse cotton fabrics, both plain and coloured, were formerly manufactured in considerable quantity, but have lately been superseded by those of England. British woollens are greatly prized, but the poverty of the people prevents an extensive sale of them. The total value of the silk and cotton manufactures in 1837 was 41,400\\(^6\\), of British goods imported 3,000\\(^7\\). The number of tradesmen and artificers in the same year was ascertained by Wood to be 982.\n\nIt is said that in 1742,\\(^8\\) when Nadir Shah entered this city at the head of his army, there were 40,000 weavers, 20,000 other artisans, and 60,000 dealers in various departments. Alexander Hamilton, who visited Tatta in 1699, calls it a very large and rich city, about three miles long, and one and a half broad, and states that 80,000 persons had, within a short time previously, died of the plague, and that one-half of the city was uninhabited.\\(^9\\) This would lead us to the conclusion, that previously to that\n\n* \"Wind-taker,\" from \u0628\u0627\u062f bad, \"wind,\" and \u0633\u06cc\u0631 gir, \"seizer,\" or \"taker.\"\n\n\u2020 New Account of the East Indies. Edin. 1727, 8vo. London, 1744, 8vo.\ncalamity the population was above 150,000.* The present population is variously estimated\u2014at below 2,000,\u00b9 at less than 10,000,\u00b2 at 12,000,\u00b3 15,000,\u2074 18,000,\u2075 20,000,\u2076 and 40,000.\u2077 The number of artisans and traders ascertained (as mentioned above) by Wood affords grounds for estimating the population at about 10,000. Tatta has been supposed to be the Pattala of the ancients.\u2078 Pottinger states that the earliest mention he has found of it is in the ninety-second year of the Hegira,\u2079 but he does not give any reference to the place of such mention. Burnes says, \u201cthe antiquity of Tatta is unquestioned.\u201d\u00b9 Outram\u00b2 assigns its foundation to 1445, but does not cite his authority. Macmurdo states,\u00b3 from native authorities, that it was founded 900 of the Hegira, or A.D. 1522. In 1555\u2074 it was pillaged and burned by some Portuguese mercenaries. In A.H. 1000, it was, according to this last authority,\u2075 again destroyed in the Mogul invasion by Akbar, and never completely recovered. In 1758 a British factory was established there, and withdrawn in 1775. In 1799 an abortive attempt was made to re-establish it. The house belonging to the factory is yet in good repair. In the beginning of 1839 it was occupied by a British garrison.

Here is a pillar of brick, between thirty and forty feet high, said to have been built to mark the spot where fell an arrow shot from a neighbouring hill by Ahmed Shah, the founder of the Durani empire, and hence the name, which signifies the circumstance. The distance, however, proves the falsehood of the story.

It contains about twelve or fifteen hundred houses, and five thousand inhabitants. It was formerly the residence of Sansar Chand, the independent rajah of Kotoch, who at one time had a revenue of 350,000l., and was so powerful as to rival Runjeet Singh. After the death of Sansar Chand, his descendants were dispossessed by Runjeet Singh, who took possession of Tira, which is still held by the Sikhs.

Vigne describes it \"to be as little worth seeing as any part of Kashmir, it being a comparatively barren and stony tract.\" It is the principal residence of that race called Kashmirian Siklis, or those whose ancestors came into the valley of Kashmir in the service of Raja Suk Juwan, a Hindoo of Shikarpoor, who about seventy years ago was appointed governor by Timur Shah. The village of Trahal is in lat. 33\u00b0 54', long. 75\u00b0.\n\nTRANEE.\u2014A village in Sinde, situate on the south side of Lake Manchar, in lat. 26\u00b0 22', long. 67\u00b0 44'.\n\nTRANKAR, or DANKAR, in Ladakh, is a hill-fort of the valley of Spiti, nearly inaccessible, as it can be reached only by a path a foot wide, and which could be rendered impassable by rolling down stones from above. It is rudely constructed of stone intermixed with unburned brick. Its elevation is 13,014 feet. Lat. 32\u00b0 6', long. 78\u00b0 12'.\n\nTREMOU, in Sinde, a village, on the route from Khyerpoor to Jessulmair, and eight miles east of the former place, from which the road lies through a level, and in general well-cultivated country, though occasionally overspread with jungle. There are several shops in the village, and abundant supplies can be obtained there. Lat. 27\u00b0 32', long. 68\u00b0 53'.\n\nTRICCUL, in Sinde, a small town where an offset from the river Fulailee rejoins the main channel of the Indus. Lat. 25\u00b0 7', long. 68\u00b0 21'.\n\nTRICOTA, a lofty mountain in the north of the Punjab, and on the south of the valley of Kashmir, has such an elevation as to be covered with snow the greater part of the year. North of it is a remarkable spring, from which the water gushes at very short and regular intervals, as if expelled by pulsations; and is received into a spacious reservoir. During December, January, and the beginning of February, the water is too warm for the hand to bear immersion in it, but at other times cold. According to Von H\u00fcgel, this is caused by the water produced by the melting of snow on the heights cooling that yielded by the fountain, which being heated by subterranean fire, has this naturally\nhigh temperature during the winter months when the snows and ice-bound streams withhold their cold admixture. This natural wonder causes the place to be considered holy by the Hindoos, and consequently to be visited as a place of pilgrimage. Lat. $32^\\circ 58'$, long. $74^\\circ 37'$.\n\nTRILOKNATH (TEMPLE OF), in Lahoul, a celebrated Hindu fane dedicated to Siva, or Triloknath, the lord of three worlds \u2014 heaven, earth, and hell. It is a square building surmounted by the trident of Siva, which deity is represented here by an image of white marble with six arms. The village of Toonda, in which the temple is situated, was, in 1838, overwhelmed by an avalanche, which destroyed most of the inhabitants. It is subject to the Rajah of Chumba. Lat. $32^\\circ 50'$, long. $76^\\circ 41'$.\n\nTROOHAWALA, in Bhawlpoor, a halting-place on the route from the city of Bhawlpoor to Ghosghur, and sixty miles south-east of the former town. It is situate in the Thur, or Great Desert, overspreading the eastern part of Marwar. Lat. $28^\\circ 47'$, long. $72^\\circ 4'$.\n\nTRUG, in Afghanistan, a village situate on the route from Kala Bagh to Dera Ismael Khan, and twenty miles south-west of the former town. Lat. $32^\\circ 47'$, long. $71^\\circ 24'$.\n\nTRUGGAR, in the Punjab, a village situate twenty miles south of the town of Mooltan, on the road to Bhawlpoor.

Lat. $31^\\circ 54'$, long. $62^\\circ 55'$.\n\nTUGAO PEAK, in Northern Afghanistan, situate about eight miles to the east of the river Tagao, in lat. $35^\\circ 5'$, long. $69^\\circ 55'$.\n\nTUKANEE.\u2014A village in Afghanistan, situate on the Kabool river, in lat. $34^\\circ 20'$, long. $68^\\circ 24'$.\n\nTUKATOO, on the borders of Afghanistan and Belogchistan, a range of mountains bounding the valley of Shawl to the north. The forked summit of the range is estimated by Havelock to be 6,000 feet above Shawl, and as this is 5,600 feet above the sea, the elevation of Tukatoo must be nearly 12,000 feet. Lat. $30^\\circ 20'$, long. $66^\\circ 55'$.\n\nTUKHTAPOOL, in Afghanistan, a village and halting-\nplace on the route from Shawl to Kandahar, and twenty-six miles south-west of the latter city. It is situate on the river Doree, here about three feet deep, with brackish water, yet not so much so but that it may be drunk. The road in this part of the route is good, and the country cultivated. The elevation above the sea is 3,630 feet. Lat. 31\u00b0 18', long. 65\u00b0 42'.\n\nTUKHT-I-SIKUNDUR, in the Punjab, a village situate near the left bank of the Jailum, eight miles south of the town of Jailum, on the road from thence to Ferozpoor. Lat. 32\u00b0 50', long. 74\u00b0 33'.\n\nTUKHT-I-SULIMAN, or \"Solomon's Seat,\" in Kashmir, a lofty hill* close to the city of Sirinagur or Kashmir, on the eastern side. The view from it is very noble, extending over the city, the contiguous lake or dal, and the whole of the valley of Kashmir, bounded on every side by mountains in most places crowned with perpetual snow. It is three-quarters of a mile long, roeky, bare of trees, but covered with grass where there are any patches of earth. Its rocks are of trap. On the summit is a massively-built Buddhist temple, having every mark of extreme antiquity. It is now converted into a mosque, and dedicated to Solomon, who, according to popular belief, drained the valley, by making at Baramula a miraculous exit for the water, which formerly rendered it a lake. Elevation above the sea, 6,950 feet. Lat. 34\u00b0 4', long. 74\u00b0 43'.\u2020\n\nTUKROW.\u2014A village in Sinde, situate about five miles from the right bank of the Eastern Narra river.

Lat. 31\u00b0 39', long. 62\u00b0 59'.\n\nTULL, in Afghanistan, a small town in the desert of Sewestan, and on the route from Dera Ghazee Khan to Dadur, through the Lakhee Surwar Pass, which is scarcely passable for cavalry. Tull is in lat. 30\u00b0 5', long. 69\u00b0 7'.\n\n* Vigne (ii. 42) states its height at 450 feet; Von H\u00fcgel (i. 238) states it at 1,200 above the surface of the lake.\n\n\u2020 Vigne (ii. 47) states, that between this and the next mountain is a gully, whence \"is constantly blowing a breeze that must tend to prevent the stagnation of its (the lake's) waters.\" Von H\u00fcgel, on the contrary (ii. 235), states that there is so complete a calm in the valley, that you can never see a wave on the lake.\nTULLAR.\u2014A village in the Punjab, situate on the road from E.I.C. Ms. Doc. Leia to Kote, on the Chenaub river. Lat. 30\u00b0 34', long. 71\u00b0 27'.\n\nTULL-I-KUMAN.\u2014A village in Afghanistan. Lat. 32\u00b0 29', E.I.C. Ms. Doc. long. 63\u00b0 28'.\n\nTULUMBA, or TOOLUMBA.\u00b9\u2014A town of the Punjab, on the left bank of the Ravee river. It is large, populous, and surrounded by a high mud wall. Close are the ruins of an ancient mud fortress of great height and strength, and probably that laid in ruins by Tamerlane in 1398.\u00b2 It is supposed by Masson Price, Mahomedan Hist. iii. 239, to be the capital of the Malli mentioned by Arrian. Lat. 30\u00b0 28', long. 72\u00b0 9'.\n\nTULWANDEE.\u2014A village in the Punjab, about twenty miles south of the town of Vazeerabad, on the route from thence to Amritsir, in lat. 32\u00b0 20', long. 74\u00b0 4'.\n\nTUMBOO.\u2014A village of Cutch Gundava, in Beloochistan, and situate on the road from Bagh to Larkhana. Lat. 28\u00b0 16', long. 68\u00b0 1'.\n\nTUNDEH, in the Punjab, a village situate on the road from Attock to Jailum, and twenty-five miles north-west of the latter town. Lat. 33\u00b0 15', long. 73\u00b0 20'.\n\nTUPPEE.\u2014A village in Afghanistan, thirty miles north of the town of Kala-Bagh. Lat. 33\u00b0 16', long. 71\u00b0 30'.\n\nTUPPERAH.\u2014A village in Afghanistan, about five miles south-east of the town of Kohat. Lat. 33\u00b0 30', long. 71\u00b0 32'.\n\nTURAHNU, in the Punjab, a village situate on the left bank of the Ravee. Lat. 30\u00b0 46', long. 72\u00b0 55'.\n\nTURGHURREE, in Afghanistan, a walled village in the province of Lughman. Here, in 1842, the British prisoners spared from the massacre in the attempted retreat from Kabool, received refuge for a short time. Near it is a tomb, called by the Afghans Kubber-i-Lamech, being supposed by them to be that of Lamech, the father of the patriarch Noah, and much visited by pilgrims. Lat. 34\u00b0 51', long. 70\u00b0 9'.\n\nTURNAK RIVER, in Afghanistan, rises on the southern declivity of the high lands of Ghuznee, or those connecting the Huzareh mountains with the Suliman range. The remotest source is about five miles north of Oba, and in lat. 33\u00b0 5', long. 67\u00b0 45', and at an altitude of 7,500 feet; thirty-five miles farther down it receives from the west a large feeder, which is generally considered the main stream, though having a much shorter length.\ncourse of about ten miles. This feeder rises in numerous copious springs at Sir-i-Chushma (Springs-head), at the base of a mountain having an elevation of 2,000 feet above the general level of the country. After this, the united stream is about eight yards wide and two and a half feet deep, with a clear rapid current. It receives few accessions of any importance in the lower part of its course, and loses much water, drawn off right and left to irrigate the fertile valley down which it flows in a south-westerly direction. It is almost everywhere fordable, and is, in fact, crossed by a ford eight miles above Julduk, on one of the routes from Kandahar to Ghuznee, though the most frequented proceeds along the right bank of the river nearly to its source. In the lower part of its course, in consequence of the draughts from it for the purpose of irrigation, the Turnak, in summer, becomes completely dry, as it was found to be eight miles east of Kandahar in the end of April, when the bed was crossed by the British army. Some miles lower than this place it was crossed by Conolly at the end of October, and found to be a narrow stream. Continuing a south-westerly course a few miles farther, it, at such times as the current is continuous, joins its scanty water with that of the Urgundab, in lat. $31^\\circ 23'$, long. $65^\\circ 8'$, having, about fifteen miles above this point, received from the east the stream of the Doree.\n\n**TURTEE**, in Sinde, a village situate on the right bank of the Western Narra. Lat. $27^\\circ 11'$, long. $68^\\circ 1'$.\n\n**TUSHAT**, in Kashmir, a village situate on the east shore of the lake or *Dal* of Sirinagur, in lat. $34^\\circ 8'$, long. $74^\\circ 44'$.\n\n**TUTAM DARA**, in Afghanistan, a village on the Ghorbund river, and at the eastern entrance of the valley of that name. Here, at the end of September, 1840, Ali Khan, a refractory Afghan chieftain, was attacked by a British force, under Sir Robert Sale, and, after a brief and ill-sustained attempt at resistance, put to flight. Though the position was strong, being defended by several forts, the casualties of the British on this occasion were very trifling in a numerical point of view. Six sepoys were wounded, but Captain Edward Conolly, an officer of high professional and intellectual character, was killed. The country in the vicinity is fertile, being principally laid down in gardens and orchards. Artificial irrigation is extensively and skilfully practised, by means of three fine canals diverging from the Ghorbund\nriver, and each extending for about ten miles in a southerly direction.* Tutam Dara is in lat. $35^\\circ 6'$, long. $69^\\circ 6'$.\n\nTUTHEE, in the Punjab, a village situate about eight miles from the right bank of the Swan, in lat. $33^\\circ 20'$, long. $72^\\circ 28'$.\n\nTUTT, in Sinde, a village situate on the left bank of the Indus, in lat. $26^\\circ 53'$, long. $68^\\circ 3'$.\n\nTUTWANU.\u2014A village in the Punjab, situate on the right bank of the Ravee.

The name signifies \"the mound of God,\" and was given to it by the natives, in allusion to the fact of its not having been made by human\n\n* Masson, though in general remarkable for accuracy, is mistaken in assigning Tutam Dara as the scene of the action at Purwan, in which Dr. Lord, Lieutenant Broadfoot, and Adjutant Crispin were killed, in consequence of the dastardly backwardness of two squadrons of the 2nd Bengal native cavalry. (See the notice on Purwan.)\nefforts. It is thus described by Burnes: \"The Ullah Bund, which I now examined with attention, was, however, the most singular consequence of this great earthquake. To the eye it did not appear more elevated in one place than another, and could be traced both east and west as far as it could reach. The natives assigned it a total length of fifty miles. It must not, however, be supposed to be a narrow strip, like an artificial dam, as it extends inland to Ramoaka-bazaar, perhaps to about a breadth of sixteen miles, and appeared to be a great upheaving of nature. Its surface was covered with saline soil, and I have already stated that it consisted of shells, clay, and sand.\" In 1826, a great inundation of the Indus poured such a stream over the desert that it cut through the Ullah Bund, forming a channel thirty-five yards wide and about thirty feet deep, and immediately below that bank expanded into a lake, covering a surface of two thousand square miles. This watery expanse received from Burnes the name of the Lake of Sidree, being that of a small fort which it overwhelmed. The place where the Ullah Bund was intersected by the Phurraun is in lat. 24\u00b0 5', long. 69\u00b0 4'.\n\nUMDANE, in Afghanistan, a village of the Daman, eight miles west of the Indus. Lat. 30\u00b0 30', long. 70\u00b0 48'.\n\nUMRITZIR.\u2014See AMRITSIR.\n\nUREUHAL, in Kashmir, a village situate about six miles north-west of the town of Islamabad, on the road to Sirinagur. Lat. 33\u00b0 44', long. 75'.\n\nURGHANDEE BALA, or UPPER URGHANDEE, to distinguish it from another in the vicinity, is a commanding position on the road from Ghuznee to Kabool, and about ten miles west from this last place. Here on the 4th of August, 1839, Dost Mahomed Khan had posted his army with twenty-eight cannon, to give battle to the advancing British, but being deserted by his troops, took to flight, abandoning his guns, which were in consequence captured. Elevation above the sea 7,628 feet. Lat. 34\u00b0 28', long. 68\u00b0 33'.\n\nURGUNDAB.\u2014A river of Western Afghanistan, which rises in the unexplored Huzareh country, south-west of Koh-i-Baba, and ninety or a hundred miles north-east of Kandahar, about lat. 33\u00b0, long. 67\u00b0, and holds a south-western course, passing by Kandahar, and, twenty-five miles below that city, receiving the water of the Turnak, flowing from the north-east. It then takes a westerly\ndirection for about seventy miles, and falls into the river Helmund, after a course of two hundred and fifty miles, in lat. $31^\\circ 30'$, long. $64^\\circ 10'$. The banks of the river between Hourz-i-Muddud and Kandahar (about twenty-six miles) are thickly studded with gardens and villages. Where crossed by the route from Kandahar to Herat, about twelve miles south-west of the former place, the Urgundab is, in its ordinary state, about forty yards wide, and from two to three feet deep, and fordable. In inundations it becomes much increased in volume, and travellers are then prevented from crossing it, though for no great length of time. It is a very valuable stream, the greater part of its water being drawn off to fertilize the country about Kandahar.\n\nURGUNDAB.\u2014A village in Afghanistan, situate on the right bank of the river of the same name, and about twenty-five miles west of Kelat-i-Ghiljie. Lat. $32^\\circ 11'$, long. $66^\\circ 25'$.\n\nURNEEYARAH.\u2014A village in Sinde, situate in the Little Desert.

It is situate in the valley of Pisheen, near a feeder of the Lora river, and in a country having some cultivation. Lat. $30^\\circ 40'$, long. $66^\\circ 40'$.\n\nUSTAD.\u2014A village of Cutch Gundava, on the great route from Sinde to Kandahar and Ghuznee. There is here a small lake of fresh water. Lat. $28^\\circ 47'$, long. $67^\\circ 53'$.\n\nUTCH.\u2014A village in Sinde, situate in the Delta, near the mouth of the Indus. Lat. $24^\\circ 19'$, long. $67^\\circ 23'$.\n\nUWUR, in the Punjab, a village situate on the left bank of Walker's Map of the river Chenaub. Lat. $33^\\circ 10'$, long. $75^\\circ 41'$.\n\nUZEERPOOR.\u2014See Azeezpoor.\n\nV.\n\nVAZEEERABAD, or VAZIRABAD, a town in the Punjab, is situate about three miles from the left or eastern bank of the Chenaub, here half a mile broad. The country imme-\ndiately about it is exceedingly fertile, and the view of the Himalaya probably the most extensive and magnificent anywhere. It is one of the handsomest towns in India; General Avitabile, an Italian officer in the service of Runjeet Singh, having caused it to be rebuilt in the European style, with wide streets, and a handsome and commodious bazaar, Runjeet Singh made here a pleasure-ground, and palace of singular construction, and covered outside with rude full-length figures of the ten Gurus, or spiritual leaders of the Sikhs, painted in fresco. Lat. 32\u00b0 30', long. 74\u00b0.\n\nVEHRAB JAGOTE.\u2014A village situate on the Pubb mountains, in Southern Beloochistan, in lat. 25\u00b0 36', long. 67\u00b0 7'.\n\nVENTIPUR, or WANTIPUR, in Kashmir, a village containing ruins, considered by some to be those of the original capital of the valley. It is situate near the right bank of the Jailum, on the route from Sirinagur to Islamabad, and twenty miles south-east of the former town. According to the chronicles of Kashmir, it was founded about A.D. 876, by Avanti Verma, king of the valley, who, after his own name, called it Avantipur.*\n\nHere are the ruins of two great buildings, resembling in plan and character those described in the notice on Matan. The greater ruin is called Vencadati Devi, the less Ventinadati. They are in a state of extreme dilapidation, yet, according to the detailed account of Moorcroft, are still striking monuments of early architecture. \"About half a mile further on we came to an interesting ruin on our right. Like others of the same kind, it is called by the peasants a building of the Pandus, the heroic princes of Hindoo epic verse, but believed here to have been giants. The edifice must have been a square temple, with four doors, approached by broad and spacious porches, and inclosed by a wall with four gates opposite to the doors of the central structure. A part of one of these was still standing, but of the walls the foundation alone remains, and the temple itself is a confused mass of ruins. The most remarkable feature of these remains was their magnitude. All the blocks were of immense size, and many of them could not have weighed less than ten tons. At the adjacent village of Wantipur we found similar remains, and here also one of the gateways was nearly entire. This was much richer than\n\n*Kaschmir, ii. 266. * According to native tradition, as related by H\u00fcgel, Ventipur was built by Ven, the last Hindoo sovereign of Kashmir.\nin the first edifice, and was covered with ornaments, scrolls, and figures. Two masses of stone on each side of the entrance, and each supported by a single pillar, were of an extraordinary size. The shape of the temple was undefined, and the principal part of its fragments seemed to be carved cornices, or portions of the roof. The stone of which these buildings were constructed is a limestone, which is susceptible of a high polish, and might be termed grey marble. The natives attribute the destruction of those solid edifices either to the zeal of the first Mahometan converts, or the reckless cupidity of individuals, not scrupling to level those great structures for the sake of their materials. Moorcroft, however, considers such agents to have been inadequate to produce their destruction. \"It is scarcely possible, however, to imagine that the state of ruin to which they have been reduced has been the work of time, or even of man, as their solidity is fully equal to that of the most massive monuments of Egypt. Earthquakes must have been the chief agents in their overthrow.\"\n\nThe slope of the mountain rising north of Ventipur was, during the ages of Kashmirian prosperity, formed, with wonderful industry, into a succession of terraces, the faces of which were supported by massive walls, and the horizontal surfaces overlaid with earth, for the purposes of cultivation. The vicinity of Ventipur, dreary and desolate enough in the present depression and depopulation of Kashmir, was far otherwise sixty years ago, when visited by Forster, who describes it with his usual simple felicity of expression: \"The evening was serene, and the variegated view of populous villages, interspersed through a plain which was waving with a rich harvest, and enlivened by the notes of a thousand birds, filled the mind with harmony and delight.\" Ventipur is in lat. 33\u00b0 54', long. 74\u00b0 55'.\n\nVERAWOW, in Sinde, a village near the south-east frontier. It is situate on the route from Omercote to Nuggur Parker, and fifteen miles north of the latter place. Lat. 24\u00b0 33', long. 70\u00b0 46'.\n\nVERE, in Sinde, a small village or station, having a scanty supply of brackish water, on the route from Cutch to Hyderabad. Lat. 24\u00b0 8', long. 68\u00b0 40'.\n\nVERNAG, in Kashmir, in the south-eastern extremity of the valley, is celebrated for a magnificent spring, which rises with a great volume of water, in a basin about a hundred and twenty yards in circumference, built by the order of the Mogul emperor.\nJehan Gir, the ruins of whose palace here are still to be seen. The water, which is very clear, swarms with trout, and flows off in such quantity as to form a considerable stream, one of the principal feeders of the Jailum. Lat. 33\u00b0 26', long. 75\u00b0 10'.\n\nVESHAU, a river of Kashmir, rises in the Kosha Nag Lake, in the Futi Panjal, one of the mountain ranges which bound Kashmir on the south. After a very sinuous course of about fifty miles, and generally in a northerly direction, it joins the Haripoor or Dumdum river, and soon after the united stream falls into the Behut or Jailum river, of which it is by many considered the principal head. Lat. 33\u00b0 48', long. 74\u00b0 58'.\n\nVEYRE.\u2014See VERE.\n\nVEYUT.\u2014See JAILUM.\n\nVHEMDARA KA.\u2014A village in Sinde, situate on the left bank of the Western Narra, on the road from Schwan to Lar-khana, in lat. 27\u00b0, long. 67\u00b0 48'.\n\nVIGIPARA.\u2014See BJBBAHAR.\n\nVIKKUR, or GHORABAREE, in Sinde, a small and wretched town, situate twenty miles from the sea, on the right or western side of the Hujamree branch of the Indus, which in its ordinary state is, opposite this place, a hundred and seventy yards wide and four or five fathoms deep close to the bank. In consequence of this advantage, it for some time was the port for the greater part of the commerce of the delta. About a mile below the town is a bar across the river, having only seven and a half feet of water at high tides. Near the town is the hull of a Dutch-built brig of war, of two hundred tons, and pierced for fourteen guns, imbedded in the earth so completely that tamarisk-trees grow on the deck. Her draught of water does not exceed six feet. The town contains about a hundred and twenty houses, built of reeds and grass, and, with the adjoining villages, has a population of 1,200 persons. Its trade is not considerable; the exports averaging about 7,000l. per annum, and the imports about 5,000l. In December, 1836, there were eighty-four boats of all sizes lying at the landing-place. Here, at the close of 1838, the British troops from Bombay, marching for Afghanistan, were landed. According to Kennedy, its navigation from the sea has become impracticable, in consequence of the Hujamree mouth having, in the course of 1838, been closed by a great change in the bed of that estuary of the Indus.

It is about six miles in extent from north to south, and still greater from east to west, in which last direction the country, viewed from the town of Wudd, is open as far as the eye can reach. The eastern part is the most fertile, producing abundance of wheat and millet. The town or village of Wudd is described by Pottinger as very small and ill-built, and Masson does not draw a much more favourable picture. According to him, \"Wudd is a small town comprising two parcels of mud houses, distant about one hundred yards from each other. The western portion contains about forty houses, principally inhabited by Hindoo traders; the eastern portion contains some twenty-five or thirty houses, tenanted by Mahometans. Among these are the residences of the sirdars or chiefs of the great Minghal tribe, Isa Khan and Wali Mahomed Khan, for the town, such as it is, is the capital of one of the most numerous tribes of Beloochistan. The house of Isa Khan is distinguished from the others by a single tree within the walls, and none of the houses have a second story.\" Wali Mahomed Khan, the sirdar above mentioned, fell fighting in the defence of Kelat when it was stormed by the British, 1839.\n\nWudd is in lat. 37\u00b0 19', long. 66\u00b0 31'.\n\nWULLEEJEE, in Sinde, a village of the Delta, on the route from Kurrachee to Tatta, and thirty-five miles east of the latter town.

Lat. 32\u00b0 37', long. 67\u00b0 23'.\n\nWULUR, in Kashmir, is the largest lake in the valley, and may be regarded as a dilatation of the river Jailum. It is, according to H\u00fcgel, twenty-one miles long from west to east, and nine wide from north to south, abounds with fish and water-fowl, and produces the singara, or water-nut, in such abundance that it supports a considerable portion of the population. So important is this nut as an article of food, that Forster\nmentions that in his time, government derived an income of 12,000l. for granting the privilege of selling it. These nuts are the roots of the plant (*trapa bispinosa*), and are obtained by dredging the bottom between two boats, in a manner similar to that by which the deeper-lying shell-fish are taken upon our coasts. In the lake is a small island, which contains the extensive ruins of a Buddhist temple of great antiquity, destroyed by the fanatic Mahometans. The lake is subject to very violent squalls, which cause the loss of such craft as may be exposed to their fury. Lat. 34\u00b0 17', long. 74\u00b0 22'.\n\n**WUNG**, in Afghanistan, a village on the route from Mittunkote to Kahun, and five miles north of the former town.

This region not having been explored by any European, little is known concerning it, except that it is drained by a large stream called the river of Zanskar, which rising near Labrang, on the southern frontier, and holding a northerly course of nearly a hundred miles, receives several tributaries and joins the Indus on the left side, about twenty-five miles below Lc, and in lat. $34^\\circ 13'$, long. $77^\\circ 2'$.\nIts confluence with the Indus, here called the river of Le, and higher up the Sinh-kha-bab, is thus described by Moorcroft:\n\n\"The river of Le, flowing from east by south, was a clear and placid stream; that of Zanskar, from west by south, came rushing with great rapidity, and dashed its turbid waters into the Sinh-kha-bab with so much vehemence as to cause a reflux current for several yards. The height at which the union of the two rivers takes place is nearly 12,000 feet.\" All parts of the basin of the Zanskar river must of course have a very great elevation, exceeding that of the confluence.\n\nZARRAH, or ZIRRAH.\u2014See Hamoon.\n\nZARSHOE, in Afghanistan, a village of the Kohistan or Highlands of Kabool, is situate on a feeder of the Pinyshreen river.

It is described by Pottinger as having from two to three thousand houses, surrounded by a mud wall; but this number is doubtless greatly exaggerated, as it would give to this obscure place a population of between 10,000 and 15,000 persons. The surrounding country, also called Zehree, is of less elevation, and consequently warmer, than Kelat, and other tracts lying northward. The soil is comparatively fertile, and, being watered by numerous rivulets, is productive of grain, pulse, and esculent vegetables.

Arrangements should be made previous to the march of any large force in this direction, for widening the narrow portions of courses, or what would be better, bridging them. There are two roads, if not more, by which troops and baggage may pass through the suburbs in this direction. |\n| Sunjeree               | 5     |          |       | Water procured from an irrigation canal drawn from the Arghandab, the river one mile distant S.E. of the encamping ground.

Bhoosa and lucern also procurable. | The road stony in some places, but generally good. An abrupt descent into the bed of the river, which would give a morning's work to forty pioneers to render easy for heavy guns; the ford across the Arghandab easy. The river at this time does not exceed two and a quarter feet in depth, having fallen about six inches since the latter end of May. A ford about three-quarters of a mile lower down the river is generally pointed out as the best for guns to cross at, and the eighteen-pounders passed the river. |\n| Names of Halting Places | Distances | REMARKS |\n|-------------------------|-----------|---------|\n|                         | Miles | Furlongs | Yards | Water and Ground for Encampment | Forage and Supplies | Nature of Road, Rivers, Hills, and general Observations |\n| Houz-i-Muddud Khan ..   | 14    | \u2014       | \u2014     | at this point in May, 1839; but this ford is to be preferred, as crossing the river above the point where several irrigation channels are led from it, which render it troublesome to convey large guns across the low plain on the right bank of the Arghandab. In times of flood, and whenever the depth of the water in this stream exceeds three feet, it must, on account of its great velocity, prove a serious obstruction to travellers. It is, however, stated that the river never remains at this height for more than a day or two at a time. It is fordable generally almost everywhere. The stream is at this season about forty yards wide. Beyond the Arghandab one or two artificial water-courses have to be crossed, and the labour of a few pioneers would be required to facilitate the passage of heavy guns. N.B. The two marches above noticed might, without much difficulty, be made in one by a small force, where time was an object; but, under ordinary circumstances, it would be desirable to allow a day for the artillery and heavy baggage accompanying an army to cross the river, particularly if the river were in flood. |\n|                         |       |         |       | The same canal that supplies water at Sunjeree runs nearly parallel to the road the whole of this march, and affords an abundant supply about half a mile south of the reservoir now dry.

Further on are the remains of a garden and artificial water-course, neglected and suffered to fall to decay within the last few years. It would not, it is said, be a work of much labour to re-open the water-course, which would allow of this long march being divided.

Since 21st May, this river had fallen upwards of four feet; at that time the stream was crossed by rafts made of rum kegs, which were rowed across by sappers; but in the event of it being again necessary to cross a force at the time the river is in flood, it is suggested that a suspension-bridge of ropes supported on trestles should be thrown across, the conformation of the banks immediately above the ferry presenting a favourable locality for constructing a bridge of this description; four 5-inch or 5\u00bd-inch ropes, with treble blocks, and a few stout spars (with the lighterlines and gear for the platform, most of which would be procurable at Kandahar), would be a sufficient provision for the purpose. The fort of Girishk is an insignificant place; the defences might be taken off by nine-pounders, were this preliminary found necessary, and the place carried by escalade; or a favourable spot where there is no ditch selected for mining, and the wall breached without difficulty; the gateways, also, are weak, and the gates of wretched construction. At a short distance from the river cultivation ceases, and a high gravelly bank, with an almost desert plain above it, extends for several miles to the northward. |\n| Dooshakh               | 12        | 7        | 76    | Water procurable from several khaareezes. Water good and abundant. An open plain for encampment. | Forage for horses and camels plentiful. Some cultivation in the vicinity, but not to so great an extent as to promise supplies for a single regiment. Fuel here, as at the former halting-places on this route, is scarce; the dried bushes found on the plain being almost the only fuel procurable. At most of the stages, however, there are mulberry-trees, which would only be used in the event of a greater deficiency of firewood than need be apprehended. | The first six miles of the road on this stage stony and undulating, the beds of several torrents, which drain the desert plain, crossing the line. After thus much of the road is passed, it becomes level and easy, till the fort of Saadaat, eighteen miles from Girishk, is reached. Beyond Saadaat, the road again passes over undulating ground within two steep slopes, till Zeeruk is close at hand. We passed the imperfect light it was difficult to examine the place so closely as was desirable. It appears, however, to be a strongly-planned little ghurree, surrounded by a dry ditch, formidable from its section, and the very hard gravel in which it is excavated. The fort was abandoned, and the gates removed, but otherwise seemed in good repair. The form of the fort was oblong, with round towers at the angles, and on the sides, about 180 by 140 yards; the ditch inclosed a space of nearly 300 by 200 yards, the space between it and the walls of the fort being intended to protect cattle and horses from a hostile force. The accompanying marginal section is submitted as an approximation to the truth. There is an abundant supply of water at Saadaat, and a large force might halt there in preference to proceeding three miles farther to Zeeruk. |\n\nWater from khaareezes, good; abundant ground for the encampment of a large force available.

The first part of the road good and level; excellent water from a khareez found at a distance of three miles from our encamping-ground, and to a force halting at Saadaat and Sur this would form a third good halting-ground at a distance of ten miles and a half from the place last named. At a distance of eight miles and a half, entered a range of hills, the path leading over which shortly afterwards became contracted in several places so much that a laden camel could barely pass. The ascent gradual; no steep slopes; the road broken and stony; the character of the hills on either side smooth, gravelly, and not abrupt, except occasionally, when the naked rock projects above the surface. This is mentioned as affording a tolerably sure indication that difficult places in the beaten track might be turned by previous inquiry being made. The apparent summit of the pass, judged to be about 900 feet above the level of Dooshakh, was reached at a distance of three miles from the base, and from this point to the end of the march, the road wound among declivities, and followed the beds of water-courses, passing over much difficult ground. The march proved a very distressing one to the camels, and occupied thirteen hours and a half; but by daylight it is probable easier paths might have been selected. Vegetation in the beds of the water-courses was very luxuriant, indicating either the recent presence of water in the bed, or its nearness to the surface. Tall reeds and tamarisk bushes abounded in the hollow places, and the hills were dotted over with a great many khunjak trees. We were informed that another route lay to the westward of the path we pursued, stated to be shorter, easier, and better supplied with water. The route, as thus pointed out, is entered in the map, and is as follows:\u2014From Dooshakh to Kurra Khan, six miles, where there is water; from Kurra Khan to Ujrum, four miles, water; from Ujrum to a sheila, or pool of water, called Guswap, four miles; from Guswap to a point half-way between Khoosh-i-Sufeid and Washere, eight miles, water; from the above point to Washere, five miles; total, twenty-seven miles. By the road we followed, the distance is thirty-five miles. In its present state, the hill path we came over is not practicable for artillery, but it might be rendered so without great labour. The other road is said to be free from obstacles, but the information obtained on this head is not quite satisfactory. |\n| Washere                | 9         | 5       | Abundance of water from khareezes.

At this season it is thirty-seven yards wide, eighteen inches deep, and has a current of one mile and a quarter per hour. Its banks, however, bear all the marks of having at times to sustain the rush of an impetuous torrent; beyond the river the road pursued a tortuous course among hills of conglomerate for about three miles, at which distance a small spring is found, a few hundred yards to the north of the road; beyond this point it leads across a hard level plain for about nine miles, without any obstacle beyond the dry beds of two considerable torrents; then, at the termination of the plain, entered a range of hills, of moderate elevation, the path being in some places narrow and difficult, and crossed in many places by the dry beds of mountain torrents. The march proved a very fatiguing one for the cattle, their labour being much increased by a strong north-west wind, which from this date invariably got up an hour or two after noon, and continued to blow from the above quarter till morning, during the remainder of the march. The Kohi Doozdan, a large insulated mountain, which has been visible during the last three marches, was passed to day; we left it to the south of the road, and the present encampment is immediately below a\n| Names of Halting Places | Distances | REMARKS |\n|------------------------|-----------|---------|\n|                        | Miles | Furlongs | Yards | Water and Ground for Encampment | Forage and Supplies | Nature of Road, Rivers, Hills, and general Observations |\n| Nullukh                | 13    | 4        | 10    | very lofty and large mountain, called Spundow (I Sfundeer), also visible from a great distance.

The road continued to thread a succession of mountain valleys without any abrupt slopes, either ascent or descent, over rather difficult and broken ground, till the end of the march, which was accomplished by laden camels in seven hours. |\n| Toot-i Kusurman        | 6     | 5        | 95    | Good water from a khareez.

At a distance of five miles and a half from Toot-i-Kusurman, the summit of the pass, which is supposed to be full 1,200 feet above the last encamping-ground, is gained. The path then descends, and towards the foot of the slope water is found in the bed of a stream, completely overgrown by long grass, bushes, and rushes; here the valley widens out to three or four miles, and the road continues tolerably level till Suowurd Khareez is reached. The road over the pass much broken, crossed by numerous beds of torrents, and in some places very stony. Laden camels would find crossing this pass by night very inconvenient; by daylight little difficulty is experienced, the march having been accomplished by them in seven hours; but for artillery, the road in its present state is not practicable, but there is no obstacle on the road which the labour of a company of ploughers might not remove or remedy in two days. If it were necessary to bring guns by this route, they should not be carried up this hill-pass till the road had been improved and reported on; and even then, it is probable a strong... |\n| Names of Halting Places | Distances | Remarks |\n|------------------------|-----------|---------|\n|                        | Miles | Furlongs | Yards | Water and Ground for Encampment | Forage and Supplies | Nature of Road, Rivers, Hills, and general Observations |\n| Sheheruck              | 15    | 5        | 115   | Abundance of good water for an encampment.

The first four miles of road passing over undulating ground, then entered a low but very rugged range of hills, through which the road wound for about two miles; a second range of low hills, met with eleven miles from Largebur Khareez, is crossed without difficulty, and at the twelfth mile the road enters upon the hard level plain which extends for twenty-seven miles to the banks of the Furrah Rood. The chain of hills, on the end of which we came at Toot-i-Kusurman, runs parallel to our line of march; the remarkable peaks called Punj Angooosht are included in the range, and are seen several miles to the left; a break in the range occurs a few miles to the west of the Punj Angooosht, the hills receding to the southward forming a valley, said to be highly cultivated, in the gorge of which is situated the village of Sour; two others were also seen under the range, but my closing in prevented their position being ascertained. |\n| Schwan                 | 15    | 12       | 175   | Numerous canals for irrigation.

Fruit was cheap and very plentiful. It cannot be doubted that if depots were, previously to march of an army, established at convenient spots on the banks of this stream, partial supplies for an army might be collected. At Sheheruk a field of wheat had just been reaped; at Schwan the harvest had been completely gathered for some days. | For ten miles, the road passed over a hard level plain; then slightly undulating ground was met with, as we came on the alluvial soil of the river; and from this point to its banks water-courses and cultivation were frequently met with. A high range of hills, with a very remarkable projecting peak, at a point between this village and Sheheruk, lies to the south of our march.

There are two roads leading to the halting-ground; that to the left, leading up the face of a hill, a short but steep ascent, was followed by the horsemen, laden yaboos; the one to the right was taken by the laden camels. Both routes were examined; that to the left is shorter and better than the other, excepting only the steep slope, which would be difficult for laden camels; with a little improvement it might be rendered quite practicable for light artillery. The difference in distance is about a mile and a half; that entered shows the longer route, on which, though generally not so smooth as the other, there is no obstruction worth noticing. |\n| Chah-i-Jchan . . .     | 17     | 2       | 17    | Watertolerably good from springs, and ample for a small force; but with a large one, or, indeed, in any case where water is procured from springing in soft ground, guards are requisite to prevent animals going to drink from stirring up the mud and polluting the water; and at its place the supply, with every care, would not more than suffice for the wants of an army.

Villages, consisting of a few houses surrounded by a wall, with round gardens attached, are numerous, and the whole plain as far as Subzawur, distant about eight miles, has been thickly populated and cultivated to a much greater extent than is now the case. Still the province of Subzawur is reported one of the richest, if not eminently the richest, district of the present kingdom of Herat, and as such is governed by a man of the first influence in the country, the eldest son of the prime-minister. The southern route to Herat falls into that we pursued at Subzwar, and a depot for supplies established at this place, or in its vicinity, would enable an army advancing on Herat from Kandahar to halt and recruit the cattle for a few days, before encountering the toilsome marches in advance of this plain. Our halting-ground was chosen at the first khareez met with on the plain. Advancing from the southward, the most northerly stream we passed on the plain is three miles and a half in advance of our present encampment. It has not been noticed in the proper place, that between Chah-i-Jehan and Hyzabad. Pools of water are found in the bed of a water-course called Gundutsan, at four miles, and again at seven miles and a half from the former place. Water from the river of excellent quality. As already mentioned, water was found in abundance at a khareez, three miles and a half north of our encampment at Hyzabad on the march. Water was also found at a stream fifteen miles in advance of Hyzabad sufficient for a force. A spring at the top of the pass, eighteen miles on the road, and water again at eighteen miles and a half. Sufficient ground for an encampment, but rather irregular. Forage and fuel abundant, the bed of the river being fringed by willows and bushes, among which much dry wood may be collected. No signs of cultivation or inhabitants near the river, nor indeed are any villages seen between the valley of Subzawur and that of Herat. A fatiguing and difficult march; no force should attempt it. From Hyzabad, if it encamped there, a force might change ground to the verge of the cultivation and irrigated land of the Subzawur plain to the northward, which would shorten the march about four miles. It might then halt at the stream called, it is believed, Khojih Ometh, where there is abundance of forage, making a march eleven miles. The water was said to be brackish, but the spahies, and some of the officers, drank of the stream, and found it not unpalatable. This arrangement would leave seven and a quarter miles to the river, on which portion of the march a difficult hill pass has to be surmounted; after leaving the irrigated land, much of which was marshy, from the overflowing of the khareezes, came in a hard stony plain, with a gentle ascent, over which we travelled for six miles; then entered hills, and continued ascending five miles and a half by a winding road, when we reached a table-land, or rather basin, surrounded by low eminences thickly spread with reeds and bushes, and bearing the appearance of being occasionally under water. High peaks rose to the eastward, the summits of which are judged to exceed 10,000 feet in height above the level of the sea.

We passed a caravanserai, called the Serai-i-Meer Daood, about eleven miles from the Serai-i-Sha B\u00e9d, but the khareez which formerly supplied it with water is dried up. From this point the eye ranges over great part of the valley of Herat, but the city itself, concealed by an intervening range of hills, called the Koh-i-Dooshakh; the distant mountains of the Huzarch country are seen, far outtopping a range of hills of considerable elevation on the other side of the valley. These mountains appear from the distance to be twelve or fourteen thousand feet high; but as the Serai-i-Meer Daood is considerably elevated above the plain, this appearance may be deceptive.

A great portion of the water is drawn off at this season for the purpose of irrigation. In the season of flood, the river is deep, and exceedingly difficult to cross. The body of water in it, however, appears greatly inferior to that of the Helmund. An old irregular bridge of numerous arches, unequal in size, formerly spanned the river. Three of the arches have altogether failed, and the whole structure is in a state of great dilapidation. The river, also, has partially deserted the bed in which it formerly flowed, a branch flowing round either end of the bridge. From our encampment on the meadow land, near the river to the city, the road passes through a succession of villages, all or most of the houses in which are now roofless and deserted; and inclosed gardens, the walls of which have been partially thrown down, and the trees generally felled or destroyed. The road is also crossed by numerous water-courses, over some of which narrow and awkward or dangerous bridges are thrown. The road has been paved, is quite worn out, and is very bad, but practicable. |\n### ROUTE from HERAT to JELALABAD, performed in 1838.\n\n| Names of Stations, &c. | Distance in Miles | Direction | REMARKS |\n|------------------------|------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Herat                  |                  |           | On leaving the town, the road to Kandahar leads due south, through a succession of gardens and fields, intersected by numerous water-courses. About three miles from the town, the Heriroad or Pul-i-Malaum river is crossed. Formerly, a fine bridge of burnt brick spanned the stream at this point, but the river has formed for itself a new channel, and now flows round one end of the bridge. The breadth of the river at the place where I crossed was about 150 yards; the stream was exceedingly rapid, and the water reached to our saddle-flaps. Several fatal accidents had lately occurred to persons who had attempted to ford the stream, when it had been swollen by a fall of rain in the adjacent mountains. To the south of the river is a fine tract of pasture-land, thickly studded with villages and gardens. |\n| Houz (reservoir of water) | 14               | S.        | Situated in an opening of the range of hills, to the south of the town. |\n| Meer Daoud             | 4                | S.        | Caravanserai in good repair, with a fine stream of clear water from a khareez, or succession of wells, connected by an underground passage, which conducts the stream from its source. |\n| Shah Beg               | 12               | S.        | Ruined caravanserai.

Subzawur is a place of no strength, and might be taken with little loss by a coup-de-main. It is situated in the midst of a richly cultivated tract of country, studded with innumerable villages, which are inhabited by Noorzais. Each village is about sixty yards square, surrounded by a mud wall, with towers at the\n| Names of Stations, &c. | Distance in Miles | Direction | REMARKS |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Kharuck               | 30               | S.E.      | A range of hills, of inconsiderable elevation, to the south of the town, distant about two miles. The road between Herat and Subzawur is good and level, and passable for wheel-carriages of every description. Abundance of fresh water in every part of this route; but provisions are not procurable at any point between Herat and Subzawur. Shahzadeh Iskunder, a son of Shah Kamran, was nominally the governor of this district when I passed through it; he possessed, however, little weight or influence anywhere, and none beyond the walls of his fort; he seemed to be a half-witted and imbecile person. He had made no attempt to succour his father, or even to divert the attention of the Persians. The surrounding country was in a state of utter disorder. Bands of plunderers were roving about in every direction, and these men were described as acknowledging neither God nor king. At this point the road from Subzawur joins the main road, between Herat and Kandahar. The range of hills to the south of Subzawur terminates four miles from the town in a long spur, upon which the remains of an extensive fort are visible. This is called the \"Kulla-i-Dookhter,\" or maiden's castle; and at a short distance from it, on a mound in the plain, are the ruins of another castle, called \"Kulla-i-Pisr,\" or the youth's fort. The plain is thickly studded with villages and khails (encampment) of Noorzais; abundance of water; road perfectly level. A grove of khunjuck trees, with a fine stream of water, situated under a range of hills, running W.S.W. and E.N.E. Wells or springs at every six or eight miles, but no provisions procurable. For the last four or five miles the road hilly, and difficult for wheel-carriages, but a road, which is described as being good and level, strikes off to the right, three miles before Kharuck, and after turning the Kharuck range, crosses the plain to Dowlutabad, where it again joins the road which I followed. Encampments of Noorzais are occasionally formed in the vicinity of Kharuck, but these cannot be depended on for furnishing supplies even to a small force. Road, or rather pathway, impassable for wheel-carriages. |\n| Summit of Pass        | 3                | S.        | A ruined fort on the right bank of the Furrah-rood; several large encampments in the vicinity. The valley of the Furrah-rood runs from N.E. to S.W., and is said to be richly cultivated. In the vicinity of the town of Furrah, about forty miles below Dowlutabad, supplies to almost any extent, and of every description, might be drawn from the district of Furrah. A son of Kamran, with the title of Saadut-ool-Mook, resides at Furrah, and is the governor of the district; he, like the Subzawur prince, has not attempted to aid his father. |\n| Dowlutabad            | 15               | S.E.      |\n| Names of Stations, &c. | Distance in Miles | Direction | REMARKS |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Checkaub              | 22               | S.E.by E. | On the 29th of May, the river was fordable at a point where it was divided into five streams, about three hundred yards above a large solitary tree, which stands on the water's edge, and is remarkable as being the only tree near Dowlutabad. Checkaub is the name given to a fine spring of water, near which was an encampment of Noorzais. The road from Dowlutabad passable for wheel-carriages. No water between the Furrah-rood and Checkaub, except a few brackish streams. Abundance of water, and a good deal of cultivation, wheat and barley, in the immediate vicinity of Checkaub. Gardens, half a mile to the right of the road, with abundance of water. Some encampments of Atchikzais in the vicinity. Water. Several encampments near some mulberry-trees, which are said to mark the half-way distance between Herat and Kandahar. Abundance of water and cultivation. Road from Largebur Khareez hilly and stony; difficult for wheel-carriages. Gardens and encampments of Atchikzais, near a fine stream; country hilly, but road good. We turned off the main road at this point, and ascended the right bank of the stream. Mud fort belonging to Mem Khan, a chief of Noorzais, on the left bank of the stream. There are about thirty other forts higher up the stream, inhabited by the Badirzai branch of the Noorzais. There are two branches of the Noorzais\u2014the Chulakzye and the Badirzai. The head of the former is Mahomed Haleem Khan (at present in the Persian camp before Herat; he was with Sheer Mahomed Khan when Ghorian was given up to Mahomed Shah), and Hassan Khan, at present in Herat, is the head of the latter. It is said that the two branches of this tribe muster from six to seven hundred families. There is no such fort as Kila Sufeid, as mentioned by Lieutenant Conolly, and inserted in Arrowsmith's map; but I was told the Tull-i-Kuman was built upon the site of what had once been the Kila Sufeid, which, like all other Kila Sufeads, is assigned to the days of Rustam and the white demon. The Tull-i-Kuman is surrounded by encampments, and is used as a \"keep\" for the flocks and herds of the chief and his people. In times of danger, these people retire to caves and hiding-places in the adjacent hills. The Tull-i-Kuman and its dependent forts are nominally under the authority of the Tyfool Moolk (a son of Shiah Kamran, who resides at Ghore, said to be about thirty-five miles north of Toot-i-Gusserman, but he has not been able, for a long time past, to extract |\n\nLargebur Khareez ... 9 E.\n\nCarwan Cazce ....... 4 S.E.\n\nToot-i Gusserman.... 10 E.\n\nGunneemurgh ...... 8 S.\n\nIbrahim-jooee River . 7 S.S.E.\n\nTull-i-Kuman ...... 7 N.E.\n| Names of Stations, &c. | Distance in Miles | Direction | REMARKS |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Khaush-rood River     | 6                | E.S.E.    | A fine stream twenty or thirty yards broad, running from the north; fordable.

This fort was built by Futteh Khan Baurikzai for his mother, who is said to have held a petty court here. Abundance of water. |\n\nThe fort of Girishk is built upon a mound, about two miles from the right bank of the Helmund. Girishk is a place of considerable strength, and, if properly garrisoned, would require a force of three or four thousand men, with a small train of artillery (four iron guns and two or three mortars would be sufficient), to insure its capture. There are four or five old guns in the fort, but they appeared to be in an unserviceable state.\n\nBetween the river and the fort is a fine chumman (pasture land) intersected by water-courses, and dotted with gardens, and groves, and villages. The country round the fort might be easily flooded, and the approach to it thus rendered exceedingly difficult to a besieging force. Mahomed Siddik Khan, a clever, intelligent young man, one of the sons of Sirdar Kohundil Khan (the eldest of the Kandahar brothers), rules at Girishk, and is the governor of the frontier district. He is attempting to form a corps of infantry, to be drilled and disciplined after the European manner. I saw about a hundred of his recruits, armed with sticks in lieu of muskets, being drilled by a fellow who looked very much like a runaway sepoy, dressed in a gay English uniform. When I passed through Girishk, Mahomed Omar Khan, and Mahomed Osman Khan, two sons of Kohundil Khan, were encamped.\n| Names of Stations, &c. | Distance in Miles | Direction | REMARKS |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Rood-i-Helmund River... | 2                | E.        | In the vicinity, with about two hundred followers, on the way to join the Persian army before Herat. The measure was most unpopular, and it was given out that, after a sufficient force had been collected, the young chiefs would in the first instance undertake a plundering expedition against Furrah and Subzawur. The Etymander of the ancients. Broad and exceedingly rapid river, not fordable at this season. The distance between the banks is about a thousand yards, but in spring it is said to spread itself over the low ground on its right bank, and sometimes to approach within a few hundred yards of the walls of Girishk. The Helmund takes its rise on the mountains to the west of Cabul, and after a course of six hundred miles, during which it is joined by several considerable streams, the principal of which are the Turnak, the Urghundab, the Shabbund, and the Khaush-rood, it falls into the Lake of Tumah. There is usually a small boat at this place, by which travellers cross the river when the stream is not fordable, but this had been destroyed a short time before our arrival, and we crossed the river on an elephant, the water being in some places about seven feet deep, 3rd June. A grove of mulberry-trees, with a small stream. There is no water between the Helmund and this place. A great deal of rich cultivation, and several fine groves and gardens in the vicinity. Abundance of water. The ruins of an ancient fort, called the Kulta-i-Nadir, which must have been a place of considerable strength in its day, about two miles to the west of Khoosh Nakbood. A large tank on the right of the road. The Urghundab, a fine stream, about half a mile to the right of the road. The banks of the river thickly studded with gardens and villages. The Urghundab, after passing Kandahar, takes a westerly course as far as the Houz-i-Muddud Khan, and then turns to the south, not as it is laid down in Arrowsmith's map. The road from the Houz to Kandahar passes through a succession of fields, and gardens, and villages, which cover this fertile and delightful valley, the breadth of which varies from three to nine miles. Nearly the whole of the water of the Urghundab is taken off by canals for the purpose of irrigation. The route by which I travelled from Herat to Kandahar, was nearly the same as that followed in 1828 by Lieut. Conolly, to the accuracy of whose statements and descriptions I can bear ample testimony. I calculated the distance to be 380\u00bd miles by the average rate of a fast-walking horse, which I found to be four miles an hour on level ground. The journey is performed by horsemen in ten, and |\n\nKhak-i-Chapan ... 24 E.S.E.\n\nKooshk-i-Nakhood, or Khoosh Nakhood 7 E. by S.\n\nHouz-i-Muddud Khan Kandahar ....... 14 26 E.

The country is occupied by pastoral tribes, chiefly of the Noorzai, Atchikzai, and Baurikzai branches of the Dooranee Afghans. They are possessed of numerous flocks and herds, and in the vicinity of their khails, or encampments, they raise a sufficiency of grain for their own consumption. These khails, which generally consist of from fifteen to fifty tents, are scattered over the face of the country, and as they are usually at some distance from the road, it is impossible for a mere traveller even to make a rough guess at the extent of population, or the amount of the resources of the country. To the south of the route above described is another, which passes through Bakwa, and which was followed by Forster in 1783, since which time I believe no European has travelled it. This southern or Dilaram road, as it is usually called, is described as being perfectly level, and not more than forty or fifty miles longer than the northern or more direct one; but there is a scarcity of water on it, some of the halting-places being upwards of thirty miles apart. It is, however, travelled by caravans and horsemen, and for an army it would have the advantage of passing within a short distance of Furrah and Subzawur, from which places supplies almost to any extent are procurable. A half-ruined village. Road, for the first two or three miles, led through gardens and cultivation, after which we travelled over an open, uncultivated plain. Good level road, free from stones. Water only amongst the gardens and cultivation. A small fort, in tolerable repair, with a stream of clear water. Opening in a low range of hills. Road good, but stony. A few houses built round the tomb of a sainted schoolmaster, situated on the right bank of the river Turnak; the course of the Turnak (N.E. and S.W.) is marked by a green line of tamarisk-trees. A good deal of cultivation round the village. Road excellent, cultivation the whole way, but no villages or khails to be seen, the people having retired from the vicinity of the highway to avoid the extortions of the great men who frequent the road. A minaret, about forty feet high, on the right of the road, said to mark the spot where an arrow of Ahmed Shah\u2019s fell, when that monarch was shooting from an eminence which is pointed out on the left of the road.

Crossed the Turnak near a mill, which marks the boundary between the country of the Doorances and that of the Ghiljies. Here we diverged from the direct road, which leads along the right bank of the Turnak, and passes Kelat-i-Ghiljie, but which is now seldom taken by travellers, in consequence of its being infested by robbers or lawless Ghiljie chiefs, who either send their followers to attack caravans, or levy contribution themselves, under various pretences. The principal of these are the sons of one Shaabaden Khan, and are considered as the chiefs of this part of the country. They are upwards of twenty in number, and are seldom mentioned by their own names, being generally called \"Buchahee Shaabaden,\" the sons of Shaabaden. They reside at Kelat-i-Ghiljie, and in the forts of this district, between the territories of the Ameer and the Sirdars, and are uncontrolled by either, although nominally their country is under the rule of the latter. |\n| Ford                  | 8                | N.E.      | Small fort.

Black-mail was levied upon us at this place by Shaabaden's men, who had heard of our being in the vicinity. Small garden, and khareez, in the district of Koorrum. Passed several forts and khails, with slips of cultivation. At the fourteenth mile, Deewalkh, a ruined fort, which is said to have been once a considerable place. As far as Deewalkh, the country is inhabited by the Hotukee branch of the tribe of Ghiljie.

It was built by the Jagatars four hundred years ago, and is situate on the southern slope of a hill to the S.W. of two minars, which are said to mark the spot upon which, or near which, stood the hazaar of Sultan Mahmood's city. The walls of modern Ghuznee are lofty, and stand upon a khareez, or fausse braye, of considerable elevation; but the ditch is narrow, and of no depth; and the whole of the works are commanded by some hills to the N.E. and N. of the place. At the northern and upper end of the town is a hill, upon which has been constructed a small citadel, forming the palace of the governor, Gholam Hyder Khan, a son of Ameer Dost Mahomed Khan. I saw one large, unmanageable gun, and four smaller ones, as I passed from the gate of the town to the citadel; I had no opportunity, however, of examining their state. The approach to Ghuznee from the south is highly picturesque; and the citadel, from its great height, looks formidable. The river of Ghuznee flows from the north, under the western face of the town, and supplies the place and the surrounding country with an abundance of water. Ghuznee may contain nine hundred or a thousand families\u2014Tanjiks, Dooranees, and Hindoo shopkeep- |\n\n* This undoubtedly means the same as \"Kharez,\" so often used, but approaches nearer the proper spelling, \"Kariz.\" The \"K\" should not be aspirated.\n| Names of Stations, &c. | Distance in Miles | Direction | REMARKS |\n|-----------------------|------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Tomb of Sultan Mahomed | 2                | N.E.      | This celebrated place of pilgrimage is situated in the midst of a large village, surrounded by fine gardens, with several running streams.

A collection of villages to the left of the road; rich cultivation, abundance of water. The country between Ghuznee and Mydan is chiefly inhabited by Wurdeks, who claim descent from the Emaum Teilabadeen; they number about twelve thousand families, and pay Rs. 90,000 to government; they are divided into three banches:\u20141.

Ditto, situated on the skirt of a range of lofty hills; at the fourth mile entered a defile called Tung-i-Khood Kabul, about three miles in length, ascended a small stream, which is crossed by the road every fifty yards; after passing the defile, the road enters an open country, the villages of Khood Kabul two miles to the right. Twelve miles beyond, Bootchak, another defile; road hilly and stony, in some places impassable for guns. Between the second defile and Teezee the road passes over the \"Huft Kothul,\" or seven passes. Khooda Buskh Khan is the chief of this district.

Sirdar Mahomed Akber Khan, a son of Ameer Dost Mahomed Khan, was encamped with his troops in the valley of Agaum. This young man, although not the eldest, is said to be possessed of more power and influence than any of the other sons. He has acquired a high character for courage, and he certainly displayed this quality in the affair of Jumrood. The government of Jelalabad has been intrusted to him; and, if he is not greatly respected by the people, he is certainly the least unpopular of the family. His immediate dependents are said to be devoted to him. His troops were scattered in the different villages near Agaum, when I passed through that place; but I believe he has twelve guns, chiefly six-pounders, in a serviceable condition; a corps of 1,500 Jazarjurchees\u2014a fine body of men, armed with long, heavy guns, which are fired from a rest, and will carry a ball 400 yards with precision\u2014and two or three thousand good horses. |\n| Jelalabad             | 24 N.N.E. | Village.

The road from Nanee is moderately good in the first six miles, crossing one or two dry nullahs and five running streams. At six miles, some sandy, light, gravelly, deep road, and a broad sandy river-bed is crossed; at 7\u00bd miles, a fine clump of trees on right, and peer, with a remarkable tomb of forty children, called Chilbucha-Ghaum, on the left hand. A deep, narrow water-course is passed here, from whence the road is good to Ghuznee, passing many killas, gardens, and cultivated country. Six killas on left. Khareez water a good stream; and considerable cultivation. Camel-forage moderate; for horses, lucern and straw for purchase. The road is good the first two miles and a half, until after it passes through the town of Roza, or suburb of Ghuznee, and burial-place of Shah Mahomed, which is large, with many gardens; the road then commences to ascend along the side of the hill, crossing six dry nullahs, and considerable ascent and descent for three miles, when it crosses a plain about three miles more to the entrance of Ghuznee pass (or Leana-i-Sher) from a ruined killa at the bottom, to the chokee at the top of the pass; it is two miles three furlongs; the ascent considerable, but easy, and in general of good breadth, and slightly stony in some parts. It is infested by notorious thieves, to guard against whom the chokees have been built. The road descends a little from this, and is good and open to Chasgon. Huft Asya is the name of the district in this part of the valley, where there are from ten to twelve walled villages in the last two miles and a half on the left. Khareez water, and considerable cultivation. Encamped near Sheenraz. Camel-forage good; for horses, a considerable quantity of short grass, straw, and lucern for purchase. The road is good, excepting some ascents and descents; slightly stony after the third mile, when the road runs along the base of the rising ground and small hills on the right. The walled villages near the road and district of Lora, or Lehda, on the left, is passed here. Several streams of water cross the road from the hills on the right at four miles; afterwards the road is again good. A forton the right, and another one mile on the left, with much cultivation. Forage for horses and camels good, and supplies water in khareez. A good stream crosses the road here at a peer, and small river a mile and a quarter on the left. These killas belong to, or are called, Khoja Russool Syuds, and lie between the districts of Tuckia and Saidabad.

Some water of the same description is crossed at a tower chokee. At the third mile the road has a general descent. Many killas are passed on the left in the first three miles. The district is called Sheenez, and for the last five miles in the Tukea district. It was here that Futteh Khan, the vizier and elder brother of Dost Mahomed, was murdered. Shekabad is a large killa on the left, with six other walled villages near, in a fine, cultivated valley, through which the river runs to the right; the same which, passing through the Loghur district, runs past the right of Cabul city. Encamped on the north of the river towards Zurnae Killa, which is on the left, two miles north of Shekabad. Forage and supplies plentiful. The road, after crossing the river at two miles, has Naib Gool Mahomed on the left, and the large killa of Shaidabad on the right, and is confined in several places by the water-courses and rising grounds on the left, from which the water runs through cultivated fields to the river on the right. The cultivation and killas of Shaidabad continue until the fifth mile, four killas on the left and six on the right, when two deep stony nullahs are crossed; the road is then good, though slightly stony, to the river, at Shekabad, which is about twenty yards broad, and eighteen inches deep, and has a narrow wooden bridge over it; there are several water-courses in this valley from the river, which are muddy and inconvenient for an army; the road in general descends gradually. Six killas, two, one mile, and four from two to two and a half miles on the left, and two or three killas on the right, two miles from the road. This is an extensive plain, with much cultivation; water one khareez at Bheenee Badam. The road is in general good, but confined a little about Tope, at three miles, by some nullahs and cultivation-banks. Tope is an ancient artificial mound, about one mile on the left, from which this district is named, and consists of six killas, terminated by Tope Chokee on the right; at the fifth mile the hills then retire further from the road, and it continues an extensive open plain to beyond Bheenee Badam. An extensive cultivated valley, with many killas, inclosures, gardens, and a fine river; the same which runs through the city of Cabul: forage for horses and camels, good and plentiful, as also supplies.

They do not pay tribute to Mihrab Khan, and are generally employed in guarding caravans through the pass of Bolan. The water is in mountain-springs. Rice, wheat, barley, and juwarree are cultivated here, and there are gardens of mulberries, apricots, peaches, and grapes. Indeed, the fertility of this road may be inferred from its name\u2014Rod-bahar, signifying the valley of spring. From Beebee Nance, the first six miles is in a plain; the road then enters the pass, which is 150 yards wide, in which a half-hid stream runs. The two villages of Jam and Baradee are off the road, on an elevated plateau. The next stage is Zer-i-Kotal, \"foot of pass,\" a distance of twenty miles. There are no habitations here, nor on the road. The stream at the stage is plentiful. After leaving Jam Baradee, the valley opens out to the breadth of three miles, in which the tamarisk-tree forms a jungle, and in which plain the water is lost. The pass is then formed again, and the water again appears; at four miles distant from the foot of the pass, the stage is level. On the top of the pass, three-quarters of a mile from the bottom, are the ruins of an old town, the streets of which are still to be traced, and several sunken spots denote the site of wells or reservoirs. The natives have searched in vain for old coins. The city is said to have belonged to Giours (Greeks).\n\nThe road from the old town then descends a little\u2014again ascends\u2014and finally, has a considerable descent, and takes a level nature and a third descent, to Sar-i-Deh. A collection of wild fig-trees, and water in stagnant pools, a distance of eighteen miles. This stage goes by the name of Rod Bahar; it is supplied throughout its length with water, and is cultivated in patches of wheat, rice, and juwarree; peaches, apricots, mulberries, &c. also abound in small gardens. In this stage there are about four hundred houses of Prij Mug-handooee and Kulooee Brahiris, who are cultivators. Firewood is plentiful. The next stage is Irarmookh, four miles, inhabited in the summer by Brahui shepherds, viz. Ladees, Jatooces, and Kulooees, to the amount of 150 tents. The water is in three wells, and the cultivation depends on the rain. This stage is out of the pass. Narmookh is on a plain, which is divided from the plain of Takht by a projecting range of hills. From Narmookh, the next stage is Takht, fourteen miles, inhabited only in the summer months by wandering shepherds. If rain falls, water will be found at Takht. The next stage is Johan, fifteen miles, a fort containing thirty houses of Johanees, under Kadar Dad, the son of Sahab Khan Johanee. The water here is in a running stream.\n\nRice and wheat are cultivated to some extent, and there are a few gardens. The next stage is Kishan, twelve milcs, containing ten houses, under Jangee Kishanee.\nThe water is in a running stream. Rice and wheat are cultivated to some extent, and there are a few gardens. The next stage is Kisban, twelve miles, containing ten houses, under Jangee Kishanee. The water is in a running stream. There is some cultivation. Kelat is thence fifteen miles.\n\nThis road is passable to cavalry and camels, but by no means to guns. Snow does not fall in the pass, its boundary being Narmookh (Narmool of maps). The inhabitants begin to emigrate to Cutchee (Cutch Gundava) by the middle of September, some on account of the cold, others on account of the scarcity of grass for their flocks, and the remaining cannot stay behind, as they would be too weak to withstand the plundering attacks of the Dhumad Kakuds. The heaviest falls of snow in Kelat do not cover the ground knee-deep, and it never remains on the ground for more than seven days. Snow begins to fall in the beginning of December, and lasts to the end of February.\n\nWhen the inhabitants of Rod Bahar emigrate to Cutchee, they first bury their grain, and cover it very artfully, so as to escape observation. The inhabitants return to Rod Bahar by the end of March. Wheat is sown in the end of August, and reaped in the beginning of April. Rice, or the rabbee crop, is sown in the middle of May, and reaped in the middle of September.\n\nThere is grazing-ground on the mountains, for flocks, during March, April, and May, and forage for horses might be procured during May. The wheat-stalks could be given to horses as long as they lasted.\n\nNo. III.\n\nRoad from Manziljah, at the entrance of the Bolan Pass, to Kelat.\n\nManziljah, in the Dasht Khurd, or small plain called Bedoulat. There are no habitations here, neither is there water. It is said, however, to have been brought by Meer Naseer Khan, Brahui chief of Kelat, from Zadakhoo, a spring ten miles to the north, by means of a small duct, to furnish the army of Ahmed Shah Duranee. From Manziljah to Marow is ten miles, over a level road, having only one slight hill. This village contains five hundred houses of Koodds, under Sardar Ala Dinna. There is plenty of good spring-water. Wheat and juwarree are plentifully cultivated. From Marrow to Isplinjee is ten miles, over a level road. The water is in springs. The village contains five hundred houses, of Bangulzaiz Brahuis, under Noor Mahommud Wadera (Patel). From Isplinjee to Koohak is sixteen miles, over a level road. The water is in wells. The village is only inhabited in the summer, as are the other villages on the road, to the extent of six hundred houses, of Bangulzaiz Badoozais, who pay taxes to the Mahommud Shahees, the owners of the soil.\n\nFrom Koohak to Gazah, a set of worked springs in the district of Mangochar, twenty-four miles; a level road, having no water or habitations on the way. Mangochar is three miles distant to the right. It contains two thousand houses of Sangaws. It is under Kelat. From Gazah to kareez (spring) of Giranee is ten miles. There is a spring called Shreenab, four miles from Gazah. The road is level. Karez-i-Giranee contains, in the winter, thirty habitations, and in summer two hundred, of mixed Brahui tribes. The water here is remarkably good compared with that of Kelat. From Karez-i-Giranee to Kelat is eight miles, the last three miles being through fields and gardens.\n\nNo. IV.\n\nRoad from Kor (Kwettah of maps) to Kelat, from my journal.\n\nLeft Kot, the road passing between two hills, and reached Saryab, a distance of seven miles. There are no habitations here. The water is in worked springs, in which are a\nquantity of fish. This is an extremely cold place in winter. A report prevails that two caravans, one of indigo and one of madder, proceeding from Hindostan, were caught in a fall of snow; the madder-merchant offered to burn his madder if the other would share the cost. The indigo-merchant refused, encamped at a distance, and perished in the night from the cold.\n\nPassing a hill at four miles from Saryab, entered a plain, and keeping along the skirt of the hills to the left, to avoid the deep rugged nullahs that cut up the lower plain, reached Pilingabad, a further distance of eight miles. The town of Teeree is in the neighbourhood. Pilingabad contains about three hundred houses of Afghans, and is surrounded by fine gardens of apricots, almonds, mulberries, and grapes. The former grow to the height of English elm-trees, and the vines are trained up them.\n\nMarched four miles and a half to Mastung, a walled town, situated in a wilderness of gardens. It contains about 3,500 houses; and a naib, or governor, on the part of Mehrab Khan, generally resides here. Mastung is famous for its melons. The inhabitants in the neighbourhood are Mashwances and Sangaos, and a sprinkling of the different other tribes of Sarawan Brahuis. The seasons in Mastuug are twenty days in advance of those of Kelat.\n\nThe direct road from Mastung to Kelat is then, via Mangochar, as follows:\n\n| Mastung Cha (well) of Guroo | situated in the Kad (vale) of |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Mastung                     | 12 miles                   |\n| Mungocha                    | 16 miles                   |\n\nNo habitations. The road is perfectly level.\n\nThis road is only chosen when express is required, on account of the distances between the watering-places.\n\nThe other road, the same by which I travelled, is as follows:\n\nLeft Mastung and marched by the roundabout road to Kelat. Halted at Shirenab; no habitations. The water is in worked springs and salt to the taste. The distance is twelve miles. The neighbourhood abounds in hares.\n\nMarched seven miles to khareez (worked springs) of Dost Mahomed, the road running through a valley. Thirty habitations. Cultivation.\n\nMarched nine miles to the Zyrat (mausoleum) of Zard. Twenty houses inhabited, and the like number in ruin. At half a mile in front is a garden, the fruit of which was this year destroyed by a blight.\n\nMarched eight miles to Sar-i-Khareez. No habitations, except twelve in ruins. A small stream. Mangochar was visible to the left.\n\nMarched sixteen miles to Zyrat, a village containing two hundred houses. Mehrab Khan\u2019s stud is stationed here.\n\nMarched four miles to Kelat. This road is a gun-road throughout.\n### ROUTE from GHUZNEE to QUETTA.\n\n| STAGES                  | Distances | Remarks                                                                 |\n|------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ghuznee to Mooshakee   | 26        | *Vide* Route from Kandahar to Cabul. Road over an extensive plain, bounded by a high range of hills to the north, and a lesser range to the south; road excellent the whole way, with the exception of some water-courses to cross, of no great difficulty. Several villages passed both on and near to the road, besides encampments of felt tents belonging to Loohanees, who come here during summer for pasturage for their camels. Killa-i-Bukshee is a collection of several walled villages. The inhabitants about here are Turkhee and Andharee Ghiljies. Supplies abundant and cheap. |\n| Killa-i-Bukshee        | 10        | Road good over undulating ground, with a low range of hills to the right. Passed a good many water-courses, besides several dry nullahs. Supplies not very abundant. Atuk, and the hamlets belonging to it, are inhabited by Populzee Dooranees. The district is called Jamrad. |\n| Atuk                   |           | Road excellent, with a slight descent, passing, at seven miles and a half, a peer's tomb, on the left, situated on an eminence. Supplies and forage abundant. Islam Killa is in the Mookur district; and this part is called Seer-i-Mookur (the head of it). |\n| Islam Killa            | 13        | Road good, over a dusty plain, crossing a deep ravine soon after leaving our camp, which was to the north of Islam Killa. Passed two walled villages on our route; the first called Kurdee Killa, the second Ars Behgee, after its owner, now a prisoner at Kabul. The Mookur district terminates here. Supplies were not brought in any quantity to camp; but the district is a very rich one. |\n| Camp about two miles N. of Jaz | 12        | Road good over undulating ground, crossing two large, dry ravines. Munsoor Khareez is a collection of three or four hamlets, situated on the bank of the Abistada lake. Supplies were scarce, and very little cultivation was seen. Our camp was on the border of a small stream of fine water running into the lake. This is the first stage in the country of the independent Ghiljies, under the sons of Shaboodene Khan, whose principal fort of Nowa is about twenty miles to the west, and south of the range of hills that bound the valley of the Turnak on the left bank. The Abistada lake is about forty miles in circumference; the water is brackish, and its banks are deeply incrusted with salt: its great feeder is the Ghuznee river, and |\n| STAGES          | Distances | REMARKS                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bara Kail       | 13        | The road followed the western bank of the lake for five miles and a half, when it crossed a range of hills, but passable for guns, then over a plain to our encampment. Bara Kail is the name of several large open villages near to each other. Supplies were abundant. This district is inhabited by Khan Turkee Ghiljies, the chief of whom resides in his fort, about ten miles south of this place. |\n| Jumecat         | 11        | The road, this march, took a more easterly direction, in consequence of our having altered the line of route from hence to Quetta. The road was good, with the exception of some dry water-courses. Several villages were visible to the right and left of the road; but Jumecat itself is a small place. |\n| Kishanee        | 8         | Road good, nearing a range of hills running from east to west, under which we encamped. Kishanee is the name of several villages, or rather hamlets; that close to our camp is called Mapan. The Ghiljies here belong to the Astuk tribe. |\n| Ghondan         | 11        | The road, this march, was very bad; and the guns were with difficulty taken over it; the first seven miles was a succession of ascents and descents, across the range of hills noticed in the last march; the last descent into the opposite valley was good. This is called Julloo Kotul. Passed, at 8\u00bd miles, a small hamlet and a saint's tomb; and encamped on the bank of a dry, deep ravine, with a good stream of water in a small canal close to it. Ghondan is a lofty hill close to the left of our camp, and gives name to this district. The Ghiljies in this valley are called Tokhces; their chief, Kullul Khan, has a fort about two miles N.E. of our camp. |\n| Busoor Kail     | 10        | The road ascended gradually for about two miles, then a descent to the dry bed of a large mullah, after which, at about four miles, crossed a range of hills by the Sherce Kotul. The road was not good, but our light guns met with no obstruction. Busoor Kail is a small village, with two or three similar ones near it. We have ascended considerably since leaving Jumecat. |\n| Spinawaree      | 11        | The first five miles of the road winds amongst the hills, but with a considerable descent. At five miles passed the hamlet of Moosa Astuk. Spinawaree is the name of a small mound in the valley, and by which |\n\nis formed from the water not being able to find a passage out at the S.W. corner; the brackish taste to it is given by the quantity of salt in the soil. There are only two or three wretched villages situated on its banks, and its silent water, with the surrounding mountains and barren country, presented a melancholy appearance.\n| STAGES          | Distances | REMARKS                                                                 |\n|----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Soorkab        | 10 2      | The district is called. A large ravine, with a good deal of water, runs to the rear of our camp. A road from Dera Ismael Khan to Kandahar, used by the Kaffilas,* crosses here. The road, for the first seven miles, winds amongst the hills, with several ascents and descents; it then joins the Soorkab river, and follows its windings, with a considerable ascent, to where we encamped; near a few huts called Nadir Deh, a little forage was found in pits, secreted by the inhabitants, but no supplies obtained. The river is confined between ranges of high hills, and the road along the bed of the river was over loose stones, making it very laborious for the horses dragging the guns. |\n| Sir-i-Soorkab  | 10 0\u00bd     | The road follows the windings of the river the whole distance, ascending considerably, and was of the same description as the last part of the preceding march; a few huts were passed, but all deserted; we encamped near the source of this branch of the river. Passed several wells on the road, called Babur-kacha, said to have been dug by the Emperor Babur, and encamped near a small stream of running water coming from the hills to the east. |\n| Khardoo Chummum| 13 3\u00bd     | The road followed the Soorkab river for the first mile, it then ascended considerably, crossing a range of hills, it then descended gradually for some miles, again crossing a smaller range near to our encampment. No village of habitation seen during the march, but a few villagers came into camp and shewed where forage was to be had. The road to-day was very fatiguing for both horses and camels. |\n| Kudunee        | 7 6       | The road followed the bed of the stream near our last camp, ascending to its source, passing at one mile and a quarter the small village of Patce, inhabited by Baurikzai Doorances; it then crossed a range of hills and descended to a few huts on the branch of the Kudunee river, having a good supply of water, near which we encamped. Some forage for our horses was procured. |\n| Tokuruk        | 11 0\u00bd     | The road to-day was very bad, having to cross a range of hills, where at times even a foot-path was not to be seen. We encamped in a hollow, on the bank of a fine stream of water, near a few huts inhabited by Sudozai Doorances. Tokuruk is the name of the district. |\n| Cutch Toba     | 12 3      | The road this march was better than the last three, generally following the bed of a river, having to cross some low hills before reaching our encampment. No village near, but in the hills are several hamlets inhabited by the Kawkers, whose country extends to the valley of Pishecu, and who are under Hajec Khan. |\n\n*The proper spelling is \"Kaffilah.\"*\n| STAGES                        | Distances | REMARKS                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hajee Khan's Fort of Toba     | 7         | We encamped about two miles west of the fort, the road following a small stream for about five miles, when it passed over a small range of hills, and we halted close under another range on the opposite side of the valley. Hajee Khan's fort was deserted, and no supplies to be had. |\n| Shargullee                   | 12        | The road for the first two miles ascended the bed of a nullah; it then descended down a deep ravine, confined by very high ranges of hills, to where we encamped, passing a small village called Soorkhow, about one mile from the place we halted at. This is the last range of hills to be crossed, as the water here runs to the Lora river, in Pisheen. The road was very bad today, lying in the bed of a mountain stream, covered with loose stones. The inhabitants had not deserted the village, and some few supplies were procured. |\n| Hassin Khan's Village, in Badshara | 8         | We descended the same valley as yesterday, leaving the river to our left for the first four miles; the road was better than for several marches, and the valley much broader; several villages were passed, and many of the inhabitants had remained; whereas, from Busoor Kail we found the country generally deserted. Supplies of grain and flour were procured, but very dear. |\n| Camp between Toresha and Paeen Killa | 16        | The road followed the bed of the river for about seven miles, with a range of hills on each side, when it entered the valley of Pisheen, the river running north of the route. From this the road was excellent, passing the villages of Noorzai, Moleeka, and Toresha to our camp, which was on the bank of a fine stream, called the Soorkab. Supplies abundant. |\n| Hydurzye                     | 14        | Road excellent, joining the Kandahar route two miles before arriving at Hydurzye. |\n| Quetta                       | 21        | Vide Route to Kandahar.                                                  |\n### ROUTE from SHAWL to KELAT.\n\n| STAGES                  | Distances | Remarks                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Quetta to Ispunglee     | 5         | Road good, excepting having to cross a deep nullah about half-way.

A stream of water on the right of the camp, and the village of Kunuk visible about two miles south-west. |\n| Mustoong                | 15        | Road good as far as Teree, a large village; about eleven miles on the road from thence had a deep ravine, and several water-courses between it and Mustoong. From Teree there is a direct road to Kelat, leaving Mustoong to the left; but it was necessary that we should have gone there, on account of supplies that had been laid in for the troops. Mustoong is a place with a good many gardens near, but the town seems to be going to decay. The district was under the Khan of Kelat, who had a Naib here, but, since Merab Khan's demise, is to be given over to Shah Shoojah. The inhabitants are Belooches and Hindoos. |\n| Shireen-ab              | 11        | After marching due west for about eight miles, the road sweeps to the south, and enters a valley, the same as from Ispunglee to Kunuk, and is equally good. There was no village near our camp, but the name of a small river to the right, where we halted, with plenty of water in it. |\n| Khareez Dost Mahomed    | 9         | A small village, with a spring of water from the hills, besides the Shireen-ab river. Road excellent, with a slight ascent. The village was almost deserted, both on account of the troops, and it being the custom of the inhabitants to emigrate to Cutch Gundava on the approach of winter. |\n| Zurd                    | 12        | Two or three small villages, but deserted; a good stream of water, and the road excellent, still continuing up the same valley as before. |\n| Burcen Chinar           | 9         | An aqueduct, and much cultivated ground, but the village was deserted. This is near the head of the valley. Mungoocha was visible to the left, by which the direct road comes from Kelat, but is not convenient for troops, on account of a scarcity of water. |\n| Girance                 | 17        | Encamped on a fine stream of water; several villages near, and the road good. |\n| STAGES | Distances | REMARKS |\n|--------|-----------|---------|\n|        | Miles    | Furlongs |         |\n| Kelat  | 8        | 2       | A strong walled town, besides a lofty inner citadel.

Road very good, and over a plain. |\n| Angeera         | 14        | Three or four houses lately deserted, formerly inhabited by Zehree Belooches, under Sirdar Rusheed Khan, whose tribe extends from this through the Moola Pass as far as Kotree. We encamped about half a mile north of the village, close to a small running stream, that comes from the west. The first part of the road went close to the hills on the right; there descended, and entered the dry bed of a nullah, which is the source of the river that runs through the pass. The road to Soomeana Bunder branches off to the right. |\n| Bapow           | 11        | A good-sized village, about a mile to the north of the road, surrounded by fruit-trees; deserted on the approach of the troops. Water from the hills, in a running stream above the village. There was a considerable descent in this march. The road, soon after leaving camp, entered the bed of the river, dry for the first three miles, after that a running stream a few inches deep, having to cross it several times. This march may be said to be in the pass. Very high mountains visible in every direction. |\n| Pesee Bent      | 12        | No village. Bent means an opening in the valley, and Pesee is the name of a fruit which grows wild in the pass. This march lay entirely in the bed of the river, dry for about ten miles, where a stream gushes out of the rocks to the right, and we had water for the rest of the way, but not deep. There was a considerable but gradual descent during this stage, and at about ten miles and a half the hills on each side sud. |\n| STAGES          | Distances | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Putkee          | 11        | Passed at seven miles the deserted village of Mordana: considerable signs of cultivation. Here the road leaves the river for about a couple of miles, which goes to the right, and joins it again before arriving at the place we encamped at. The river was crossed several times, but the water was not deep. A good deal of tamarisk jungle this march. The valley was about three hundred yards wide at our halting-ground. |\n| Paesht Khana    | 10        | The first five miles of the march was very tedious, having to cross the water several times, and the bed of the river very stony: from thence the hills opened into a large plain, with a much better road, the river taking a sweep to the north-east, to meet another stream which comes from Panduran. The ruins of a village were at Paesht Khana, which is the name of this open plain. A direct road from Kelat joins here, which comes by Joorgee and Panduran. It is not practicable for guns. |\n| Nurd            | 11        | At three miles passed Peer Luttoo, a faeker's abode, close to the left of the road; at eight miles Dodandan, two peaks on a high range of hills to the right. The first half of the march had to cross the river several times; the river then turns to the right and joins another stream, following which is a road to Kozdar, by Guz Gooroo and Zeedee. A few huts near our camp, and some supplies were obtained. The hills were close on each side for about six miles; the valley there opened a good deal. From Bapow to Nurd, our direction had been about south-east, but from the commencement of this day's march it took a sudden turn to the north, and continued so for about six miles; then for half a mile nearly south; then again north. At six miles and a half, passed the tomb of Lakka\u2014the mausoleum of the saint of that name, the adopted son of Lal Shah Bhaz, whose shrine is at Sehwan. Road, as usual, generally followed the course of the stream, with a considerable descent. |\n| Jung-i-Kooshta | 12        | Passed the village of Hootachee, at seven miles. First part of the road very good, having the river to the right. A village here, and some supplies. First part of the march left the river to the right, passing Pancewun to the left; after that, a jungle to go through, and the last two miles crossed the water. |\n| Bent-i-Jah      | 10        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Camp, one mile a half short of Kohow | 11 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| STAGES | Distances | REMARKS |\n|--------|-----------|---------|\n|        | Miles | Furlongs |         |\n| Kullar | 10     | 0\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) | several times.

The other streams are swampy in some places. |\n| Top of the ascent | 2 | The ascent is very gradual but stony, crossing five stony nullahs from the high hills on right. |\n| Descent to the level plain, and cross two streams | 1 | The descent for one furlong is rather steep; the guns came down with the drag-chain, without unyoking the horses. Afterwards, along the bottom of the defile, gradual, but rough and stony, like the dry bed of a river. The heights require to be guarded from the attacks of plunderers. Two large streams come out from the base of the hills on right here, which are crossed to the level plain, in which Kuchlack lies. |\n| Kuchlack | 1 | Kuchlack is a small village on the bank of the brook, with a small fort three furlongs beyond it. There are several other forts and villages near, in this extensive plain, and much green cultivation. This village is between two and three miles from the base of the Tukatoo mountain, the double point of which is the highest in the range; it was wreathed with snow a great way down, and stated to be upwards of eight thousand feet above the level of the sea. The inhabitants retired to the mountains on the approach of the army: they were induced to return by the Bombay division when they passed, and brought some few supplies for sale. |\n| Camp, 11 5\u00bd | | A good stream, five or six yards water, eighteen inches deep, between thirty and forty feet beneath the level of the plain; banks perpendicular in some places. |\n| General direction, N. | | The road now winding a little among low sandy hills or rising ground, but good; dusty, but not deep. |\n| Cross Lora River | 2 | A good stream, twenty inches deep, three or four yards broad, thirty feet below banks muddy. |\n| (Eighty yards wide) | | Do. do. |\n| Cross a deep Nullah | 3 | A small village, with considerable cultivation. There is another village, about one mile to the left, on the opposite bank of the river, inhabited by Syuds. The village was deserted on the approach of the army: a few of the men remained during the time. Care should be taken to guard the baggage from the Kowkur Beloochees who infest the higher range on left. The Syuds, though not plunderers themselves, through fear connive at the thievery of the Kowkurs. |\n| Cross another deep Nullah | 1 | Over a fine open plain. |\n| Cross Lora River | 1 | Another road runs along the side of the hills on left, said to be more direct; the open plain continues on right, with short green grass. |\n| Ditto ditto again | 6 | Road good.

The road winds along the base of some low sandy hills for a mile further, where the baggage requires to be well guarded against plunderers. |\n| Hykulzie and Khedazie... | 10.7 | A large village with walls; Khedazie is open. This is a very extensive plain, with much cultivation, and several other villages near. The river runs past, three furlongs to the south of Hykulzie, which is principally inhabited by the Syuds, most of whom speak Hindoo-stanee: were civil, and brought in many supplies from the surrounding villages. |\n| Cross Lora River to Camp... | 7.1 | There is no village here. The road runs, after the first two miles, along a deep nullah, which is crossed at four miles and three-quarters twice; it is fifteen feet deep, rough and difficult; a road for the carriages was made over it. The road after runs along between deep and dangerous nullahs of the same description; the ground along river for a great way is of the same uncertain description, with intervals of good level ground. The river has seven or eight yards of water, two feet deep, between forty and fifty feet beneath the level of the plain, with double banks on each side; the guns were brought over by fatigue-parties for about four hundred yards. Forage is scarce on the plain here, but there is a good deal of thin grass in the higher bed of the river. |\n| Tookanee, on left... | 1 | A small village. |\n| Koolazy... | 3 | A large village on left; Mazye, a large village further to the left beyond it about one mile. None of these villages were entirely deserted when the leading division passed, and much cultivation appeared all round. |\n| Urumbe... | 2 | The plain or district here about is called Urumbee. The camp was formed a mile and a half beyond Koolazy, one mile on right of a fort and village, at a good stream or canal of running water. Forage and some supplies were brought into camp. The road was good, and the country covered with lye-bushes to near Koolazy, apparently nearly all withering away from drought. |\n| Camp, two miles and a half north of Killa Abdulla... | 6 | Camp on the left bank of the river, which is broad and shallow, and has a small stream running here, which disappears a little further down. Considerable green grass was found between the low hills on right, and green corn and grass were brought from about Killa Abdulla. Supplies came in in great quantities. Abdulla is in possession of a battalion of infantry, belonging to the Shah. |\n\nVOL.

A spring of water crosses the road half-way up the steep ascent, which is cut for the guns, along the side of the hill. |\n| Top of the first ascent ..... | 1         | The descent is nearly as steep as the ascent. A good stream of water here crosses the road, and another road comes in on left, by which part of the baggage came.                                               |\n| First descent ............... | 1\u00bd        | This ascent is fully as steep as the first, especially at a narrow turn near the top; the best camel road is turning to the left from the gun road about half-way up this ascent for about half a mile, when a good road for camels will be found leading down a small water-course, with a gradual descent, but only sufficient for one camel at a time. Care must be taken to avoid following a path which runs to the right of this, which runs over a small ridge, by which some came down, but many fell in attempting to do so in the ravine on left, which is the road. Guards should be placed at all paths leading from the high road, to prevent any one entering them, and the heights must be well protected as the baggage passes, the hills being, as usual, full of plunderers. |\n| Top of second ascent ....... | 2\u00bd        | This is longer and steeper than any of the other ascents, turning sharp round a point near the top, on the brink of a precipice. The carriages were dragged up and lowered down at these places by strong parties of European infantry. |\n| Bottom of second steep      | 3\u00bd        | A few springs in a hollow on right, with some short grass. A better road than either of the above is reported to run off to the right from the stream of water after passing the first ascent and descent, joining the gun road again about two miles and a half beyond the bottom of the last steep descent by a more gradual one. |\n| descent, on the gun road     |            | Forage for horses was scarce at Chumun, but some more springs and green grass were discovered more to the right of the usual halting-place. Camel forage pretty good. Foraging parties from this should be alert and well guarded. |\n| to a small stream .......... |            | This is a reservoir of water, supported by a canal from the hills from a great distance on right. There are other pools of standing water, but not sufficient for more than a small party. The canal was turned off on the second day when the leading division passed, on a pretext of not receiving remuneration. |\n\nChumun ...................... | 11 4 N. 55 W. |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Dund-i Gollai .............. | 15 N. 40 W. |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| STAGES | Distances | REMARKS |\n|--------|-----------|---------|\n| Puttoo Killa | 9 miles | descent continues but gradual for three or four miles after leaving Chumun over a dry plain, crossing seven or eight shallow nullahs with green bushes about them, but no water. A small pool was passed at twelve miles and a quarter. The dry bed of a large nullah or river is then crossed, and ascend a number of low sand ridges, which continue for about a mile and a half. Forage was scarce, and no village near. This fort and village was deserted on the approach of the army, and the canals cut off from the same place as those belonging to Dund-i-Gollai; both coming from the same hills, reported about fifteen miles to the right; encamped about four miles and a quarter south of the fort; the standing corn was brought in as forage, which must otherwise be scarce for a force; about four or five miles to the left are several good wells, and in a more direct line to the camp of Mele, by the plain, avoiding the hilly ground north of Puttoo Killa; part of the baggage came round these hills, and reported the road good. |\n| Mele, or Melamanda | 11 miles | There are the remains of several small villages, but lately deserted, a small stream in the bed of the river, and some wells; there are several wells and springs in the road that comes through the hilly pass from Puttoo in the last mile, which the generality of the army followed, encamped on the bank of the river to the right; there were several other wells and pools of water found north of the camp one mile and a half; forage from the river and nullah-beds, and the standing corn. The road ascends very gradually until about four miles north of the fort, when a succession of rough ascents and descents over nullahs between the two hills, which approach here to a narrow pass, occur, descending then gradually all the way to the river. In the event of Puttoo remaining drained of water, the route to the left over the plain would have every advantage over the other. |\n| Mele, or Melamanda, to Doree River | 14 miles | No village near, but a good deal of cultivation along the river. The road is over undulating, dry, stony ground for ten miles and a half, covered with katara and wild-thyme bushes, passing at a narrow part between the hills at six miles on the north-west out of the valley of Melamanda, where the road is confined a short way and more stony; crossing afterwards three or four large nullahs; at twelve miles several cucha wells were passed, two only had water; they are deep. There is some grass about the river, a good deal of lye-bushes and other camel forage.

A considerable quantity of supplies came in here, forage, some short grass, lucerne, and green corn; water from the aqueduct. The road from the Doree river is good, crossing eight nullahs, all small, running to a large nullah, with high banks, and ruined buildings on left. Koosh-aub is a general name given to the villages in this part of the plain; there are six or seven large villages all within two or three miles of this camp, and much green cultivation. The village passed at ten miles on the right side of the road is large and populous, and well supplied with water, forage, a good deal of green grass, and lucerne. A large village, with many inclosures and gardens, besides very extensive cultivation along on the left, over a very extensive plain. A large village, many supplies exposed for sale here on the approach of the army; gardens and inclosures as above, with much cultivation. Inclosures, gardens, and habitations, called also Koolcha Bagh. Buildings and ruins of the city of Shah Nadir. Shikarpoor gate, Kandahar city is nearly a rectangular figure, one mile in length, nearly north and south, and three-quarters of a mile in breadth; the country outside is open on the south and west, but a few inclosures on the north end, and extensive cemeteries, durgahs, and peers; the west side is more inclosed, especially at the south-west, where gardens, inclosures, and villages at intervals confine the country, for between two and three miles. |\n\nZankur Village . . . 2 2\u00bd\n\nKurazee . . . . . . . 2 6\n\nPopulzie, on right . . 0 3\n\nNawdree, on left . . 0 2\n\nKandahar City . . . 1 6 7 4\u00bd\nROUTE from DADUR to KANDAHAR.\n\nFrom Dadur to the Shikarpoor gate of Kandahar, the Perambulator ran 225 miles and 5 furlongs, divided as follows:\n\n| Distance          | M. | F. |\n|-------------------|----|----|\n| Dadur to Shawl or Quetta | .. | 84 |\n| Kandahar          | .. | 140|\n| Total             | .. | 225|\n\nRoad.\u2014The road itself from Dadur to Kandahar cannot be said to be a bad one, as all our wheeled carriages, including some heavy pieces of ordnance, traversed it, and the famous Bolan Pass, which was expected to offer many difficulties, was easily surmounted. The Kojuk Pass, however, over the Amran range, is very bad, and the descent on the northern face so abrupt, that all the guns had to be handed down by working parties of European infantry.\n\nAscents and Descents.\u2014From Dadur, which is itself six hundred feet above the level of the sea, there was a very perceptible rise to the top of the Bolan Pass, until we reached an elevation of 5,100 feet, giving a rise of 4,500 feet in about fifty-seven miles; consequently we experienced a considerable improvement in climate as we advanced. From the top of the pass to a descent of about five hundred feet, between Shawl and Koochalk, the first march from it, the road was over a level country; the same may be said of the road between Koochalk and Killa Abdoola Khan, near the foot of the Kojuk Pass. After crossing this pass, the road gradually descends to Kandahar, passing two or three low ranges of hills.\n\nRivers, Water.\u2014From Dadur to Sir-i-Boolean, we encamped daily near a fine stream of water, which rises at the latter place. Between this and Sir-i-ab, for thirty miles, not a drop of water is to be found, consequently both our people and cattle were much distressed. When the country is under our rule, and our influence firmly established, one of the first acts of the local Government should be to dig an aqueduct from Sir-i-ab to the top of the pass, and bring down one of the many mountain-springs in which this country so happily abounds, the soil easily admitting of its being dug. From Sir-i-ab to the foot of the Kojuk Pass, water is abundant at every stage, and is also plentiful from springs on the northern side of the hills. From this place, however, we had to make a forced march of twenty-four miles before water could be found, with the exception of a dirty pool at Dund-i-Goolae; and when we reached Killa Footoola, the water there had been turned from its usual channel, so that the army was much distressed. From this latter place to Kandahar we found water at every stage.\n\nMountains.\u2014I have before stated that from Dadur to the top of the Bolan Pass we ascended 4,500 feet, and our route was bounded by mountain ranges many hundreds of feet higher, being shoots from the main chain on which we found ourselves on arriving at the top of the pass. From thence there was little perceptible descent until we went down the pass between Quetta and the first march to\nKandahar, but very lofty hills were on each side of our route a few miles distant, and with snow on them. The next range we came to were the Amran hills, which intersected our line of route at the Kojuk Pass; these are about 1,200 feet above the surrounding plain. From this no other elevated range occurred near our line of route, although hills of some magnitude are visible in all directions.\n\n**Boundaries.**\u2014Dadur, in times of peace, and when the rule of the kings was in force, paid tribute to them; but I believe the district bearing the same name does not extend beyond the entrance of the pass itself, which may be considered debateable land under no authority, but chupased by several marauding tribes of Beloochees, who collect black mail from any traveller they fall in with, and unable to resist their demands, and in most cases their exactions are coupled with murder.\n\nFrom the top of the pass, as far as Koochalk, the district of Shawl extends, which belongs to Merab Khan, of Kelat, and here commences the territory of Kandahar.\n\n**Inhabitants.**\u2014The Bolan Pass is infested by many tribes of Beloochees, who subsist principally by plunder and chupasing different districts. Their habitations are some distance from the high road, and I believe they generally reside in caverns. They have large flocks of sheep, and cultivate small patches of ground. Either their antipathy to us must have carried them to commit acts of violence beyond their usual custom, or their natural character must be cruel and ferocious. The latter, I fear, is the case; and even this is not coupled, as it often is, with courage, for their excesses were always committed upon our unarmed followers, or when they knew it was not possible to attack them.\n\nFrom Dadur, the whole way to Kandahar, whenever any hilly country occurred, we always found it infested by the same class of persons, either Beloochees or Affghans, of equally bad character. The few villages we passed in the plains were generally deserted; but, from signs of considerable cultivation, the inhabitants most probably were of a more peaceable character.\n\nThe villages in the vale of Pisheen are generally inhabited by Syuds, who keep up a considerable traffic with Bombay, principally in horses; they remained in their villages; most of them spoke Hindoostanee, and very willing to furnish what supplies they had to part with.\n\n**Produce.**\u2014The first cultivation we met with was in the Shrawl district. Wheat was the general produce, besides artificial grasses. There are many orchards, in which, for the first time, we saw several European fruits.\n\nThe Pisheen valley is also well cultivated; the same kind of produce as before mentioned from this to Kandahar; cultivation was very limited until we approached this city.\n\n**Climate.**\u2014Dadur was very hot when we left it. In April it rose to $105^\\circ$, but the nights were cool, the glass falling to $52^\\circ$; the first two marches in the pass it was still higher, but from that an improvement took place daily until we passed Quetta. Dadur is said to be insupportable during the months of May, June, July, and August, and very unhealthy; the Bolan Pass still worse, no one but kossids venturing through it in these months. We have since heard that detachments of our army with convoys have marched through it, but the sickness they suffered is sufficient proof that only in great necessity should it be attempted. The cli-\nmate of Shawl is very good, but the winter severe; the first detachment of British troops that ascended the pass had a fall of snow in the beginning of April.\n\nBy all accounts, the whole country we passed through, from Shawl to Kandahar, is considered very healthy, although the heat in the summer months at times is very oppressive. The following was the range of the thermometer from our departure from Dadur to the day we left Kandahar, kept in a tent:\n\n|                  | 1st to 15th April | To 30th April | May | June |\n|------------------|------------------|---------------|-----|------|\n| Maximum          | 105\u00b0             | 90\u00b0           | 103\u00b0| 110\u00b0 |\n| Minimum          | 52               | 45            | 53  | 56   |\n| Mean maximum     | 94               | 90            | 100 | 102  |\n| Mean minimum     | 62               | 58            | 59  | 61   |\n| Medium           | 77               | 75            | 79  | 82   |\n\nVery little rain falls; we had not one shower during the whole of this period. Snow falls more or less during this line, the melting of which is principally depended on for watering the fields.\n\nManners and Customs.\u2014During the whole march we saw but few of the inhabitants of the country, excepting the wild tribes of the hills that infested our line of route for plunder, and a more lawless set of rascals it is not easy to imagine. Blood with them is cheap as water; even the cultivators go armed; and the constant feuds between different tribes, coupled with their plundering habits, renders this necessary. Every person seemed well dressed; and, but for the insecurity of life and property, might be happy and contented, the country yielding every thing necessary for their support, with the advantage of a fine climate.\n### ROUTE from DADUR to SUKKUR.\n\n| STAGES          | Distances | Remarks                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dadour to Nowsherra | 7         | At nine miles cross a deep nullah from Nowsherra, with little water in it, but muddy.

It is a good place; the houses are built in the same manner as those of Hyderabad, being a framework of wood, with mud plaster. The bazaars are good. Outside the town there are the ruins of several large mosques and tombs, which shew that it must have been a place of considerable importance. The banks of the Indus, about Roree, are thickly lined with date-trees. There are also many Persian wheels used to water sugar-cane and wheat-fields. |\n| Khyerpoor    | 16 6      | A good road, with many villages, and cultivation; water is to be procured from wells at every place.

The country after this is level, with jungle and small hamlets, till you come to the banks of a branch of the Indus, called the Narra, which is filled during the inundation; it is about fifty yards broad and twenty feet deep; there was a little water in it, flowing to the south. This branch is supplied by three feeders from the river, and passes near Omerkote and Luckput. Bunder Ghurree is a pretty good village, with ten shops; supplies moderate. There are two more villages within a few miles. A shorter road from Tremon passes by Saleka Budra, but the Narra is difficult to cross, on account of mud. |\n| Rajarie      | 16 5      | N.B.

They are sufficient for small parties, not exceeding a wing of a regiment of infantry, but could be easily deepened. The water does not remain during the hot season. Coarse grass very abundant. Surdar Ghur is a brick fort with round bastions, about two hundred yards square; the gate is on the south face. The outer wall may be ten feet without the parapet, the inner one twenty or twenty-five feet, and the keep about ten more. It appears in good order, and mounts two guns.

From the Arrul and Narra rivers these water-courses are only filled during the hot months, and become dry as the waters of the inundation are drawn off; the villagers then resort to their wells, of which there are generally one or two in each village. There are numerous villages along the road, but, on account of the inundation, they are built on the rising ground, and generally about two miles from the bed of the rivers. Supplies and forage are good and abundant, till within forty miles of Larkhana, when provisions become rather scarce. Though I saw a vast tract of land under cultivation, the grain, I was told, is carried off to Larkhana or Sehwan. Fresh guides should be procured from the villages along the route, in preference to one from Sehwan for the whole way: the former have a better knowledge of the country, and are more to be relied on.\n## ROUTE from LARKHANA to KYRA-KA-GURRA.\n\n| STAGES          | Distances | REMARKS                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Larkhana to Futtypoor | 6         | Good road through a jungly country.

Two small choppered villages, with some cultivation. Three wells. A nullah was found, with a good supply of water, about one mile on the south-west of the village. A small stream runs through Arer Peer, about a mile and a quarter to the westward, and a good supply of water always to be found one mile further in the same direction in the bed of the river. The road is very good, over a level plain. |\n|                               | 11        | Tairac, a middling village, is passed at four miles and a quarter, and Cuchee, Bajar, and Jangur, three large villages, from two to three miles distant, on the right bank, about nine miles from Sehwan. Forage was got by the grass-cutters about Arer Peer, also kirby to purchase. |\n| Warkee River, near its junction with Chorla River | 14        | The Warkee river is small, and joins the Chorla river about half a mile on the right, near which there is a pool of water, at the foot of a rock, which terminates Loond Hill, and which lasts all the year. Warkee camp appears to be the usual halting-place, and had more grass about it than where the dragoons encamped. There are two roads, which separate at the place where Dheeng river is crossed, about four miles from Rorce, one running on each side of Loond Hill, and meeting again one mile in front of Warkee. The road running to the right of Loond Hill, along the Chorla river, is longer, but reported better. The halting-place by it is called Chorla Mukam, near some ancient tombs, where there were also fine pools of water in the river. The other road is more stony, as it crosses the Dheeng river two or three times. Some good pools of water, stated to last all the year. Forage scarce, but procurable by grass-cutters about the river and the hills on the right. The ranges of hills on each side approach much closer, and at four miles the road enters the defile of the Joorung river, and continues along its bed and banks for about three miles very rough and stony, and some rocky nullahs afterwards are crossed before reaching camp. |\n| Camp at Mulleeree River       | 10        | Extensive pieces of deep water, and a small stream running. There is no village seen since leaving Rorce, though some of the shepherds of the country brought in some goats here. There is a good deal of thinly-scattered jungle, amongst which the shepherds' huts are located. The road continues to ascend slightly, until the fifth mile, crossing four or five rocky nullahs, running into Mulleeree river. The road is then better, with a slight descent, and crosses some nullahs, running southward into the Pokrun river. Forage more plentiful, but procured in the same manner by the grass-cutters about the river-banks. |\n| Pokrun Camp, on Pokrun River   | 12        |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The distances are given in miles and furlongs.\n| STAGES                        | Distances | REMARKS                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Kajoor Camp                   | 9         | Good pools of water. This is the same river with the Pokrun, but the forage not so plentiful. The road is pretty good in general, crossing the river at the sixth mile. At the eighth mile it is confined between the hills and river for a short distance, where it is rocky, and crosses the river again to camp. Roads run off here and about midway to Moohun Kote, a fort of the Amoers, beyond the hills on the left. |\n| Doobah Camp, on the Doobah River | 8         | Good pools of water on the same river, here called the Doorbah. Forage as above. The road is pretty good all the way, through thin jungle, crossing ten or eleven nullahs, some of which are stony. |\n| Murraie Makam, on the Murraic River | 9         | Water in the sandy bed of a broad river. Ahmedkhan's Tana, a large village, with good supply, is about two miles south-west, further up the river; it is the residence of the soobedar of the district. Two other small villages lie between it and the road, called Mahomedkhan and Janser; but neither have any supplies. There are two roads here, one running on each side of a low range of hills; that to the left is the usual route, and the halting-place at Meerkhan Tana, a village with two or three shops, and is also on the bank of the Murraie river, with water from pits in its sandy bed. The guides brought the detachment by the other road, as having more water, and on account of its being nearer the large village of Ahmedkhan. The road pretty good. |\n| Dumajee                       | 9         | A small village of about twenty choppered huts, and a few banian supplies. Water from two wells, and a pool of rain-water in the bed of the river, all of which were exhausted, and found insufficient for the detachment, and part of the camels were not watered. Forage more plentiful, but some distance on the plain to the front, and rear of the stage by the road. The road pretty good. |\n| Irak Mukam, at Irak River     | 9         | The Irak river is crossed at nine miles and a quarter, and water is found in its bed at all seasons, about two miles on the left, at the base of the hills through which it passes to the southward. The distance is not increased by going to this point, though so far off the beaten camel-road, as paths go direct to and from it before reaching the river. Forage abundant, and the road good through jungle; and some cultivation at the fourth mile. |\n| Bhool Camp                    | 2         | A place at the Huttul Ke-bhoot hills, where a nullah contains a good supply of water from the late rains, with plenty of forage. Country covered with thin jungle and grass; but Irak should be the halting-place, making Kuttajee the next stage. |\n| Kuttajee Mukum, at Kuttajee River | 12        | The river about six furlongs on the right has good pools of water, which never fail, especially at the base of |\n| STAGES                        | Distances | REMARKS                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Goorban Camp, at Goorban River | 18        | This long march was made from an expectation that, from not having gone off the road to Irak, a distance of from three to four miles had been saved, which was not the case, as it proved. The hills here, where it passes through the range to the south-west. Forage as above. The road is in general good, excepting where it crosses some nullahs, and is a little confined between the river and some low hills on the left, at the eighth and ninth miles, where it is stony; then good through jungle-bushes to Kuttajee. The confluence of the Goorban and Kuttajee rivers, both having small running streams and large pieces of standing water. Forage not so plentiful. The road at two miles from Kuttajee has a slight but stony ascent, at the top of which the Gohar Talloo occurs, at present filled with rain-water. At three miles and a half, a rocky ghaut or defile commences, and continues an easy descent passable for guns; but being most of it bare rock, is rough, and crosses two stony nullahs at the bottom. At four miles some more rising ground is passed from the nullah, when the road is good again, along the Kuttajee river to camp, crossing the river at the junction. Camp Dumba is on the Dumba river, which has good pools, and a small stream of water running. Forage is procurable by the grass-cutters in considerable quantities about Dumba, but more plentifully a few miles before reaching it. The road is in general good, and passes Peepulwaree river and Mukum at six miles and a quarter, which has water in some small wells, at present dug in its bed, and a good deal of short grass and thin jungle. This road is that generally travelled, and is longer than that by Dozan about one mile, but stated to be much better, the first thirteen miles being over an extensive level plain, in most parts thin jungle; but good well-beaten tract at ninth mile. Rekee Koree and two huts are passed on left; but the well is small. Amree Nullah, at present containing pools of water, from the late rain, is passed at ten miles. At thirteen miles the road runs through some rocky ridges, and uneven hard ground, passing a pool of salt-water at thirteen miles and a half on the left, and is then good to camp. |\n| Dumba Camp                   | 10        |                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Camp Kurrahee, to the lines of the Grenadier Regiment, by the high road | 17 1/2    |                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Kurrahee Town                | 2         |                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n### ROUTE from KURRACHEE to KAJA JAMOTE.\n\n| Names of Places | Bearing | Distances | Supplies | Water | REMARKS |\n|-----------------|---------|-----------|----------|-------|---------|\n| From the town to Muggch Peer | N. 10 E. | 9 1 | none | hot springs | This is the Muggeh tank described by Lieut.

There is a pukka musjid, and tomb of Awlea Shaw Billaest. It is said the present resident never eats food, but lives on some heavenly substance supplied to him by the genii\u2014an extraordinary assertion, but credited by the people in the vicinity. The spot is sacred, and those who can afford to be buried there esteem themselves fortunate.\n\nThe bed of river is full of very large babool trees and stones.\n\nVery bad road, full of large stones.\n\nNullahy and stony country.\n\nThe small pass is as if it were paved with common flat stones.\n\nThe large one nearly perpendicular. The camel could scarcely go up it, and even then would not have succeeded unless assisted by the ropes.\n\nBed full of tamarisk and stones.\n\nDeserted, except in the rains.\n\nRunning stream, three feet deep.\n\nForty huts; 160 inhabitants; can bring into the field 100 matchlocks. This is similar to other villages of the description given\u2014mat huts, and merely temporary. It is probably by this time abandoned, as the people say they merely were there in the rains and hot weather, when the heat on the Hubb river is insupportable.\n\nHoja is the name of the chief, Jamote is the name of the tribe: they are Moosulmen.\nROUTE from SUBZUL to SHIKARPOOR.\n\nSurwelee, the last stage in Bhawal Khan's country, is a small village, bearing the tomb of Nawab Moosa Khan; direction, north-east, $80^\\circ$; distance, eight miles from Subzulkote, and the road leads through slight jungle; a nullah about half-way, with a wooden bridge, and a village: the frontiers of Sinde.\n\nSubzulkote is a pretty large village, having a good bazaar, and many wells, out of the town, of good water. To the north is the dund or lake, which is fast drying up. The spot chosen for encamping-place is among some broken ground by the plough, south-east of the town, in the neighbourhood of wells, and a small jungle which can soon be cleared.\n\nOobowrah is about thirteen miles distant from Subzul, due west. The encamping-ground lies north-east by south-east, the same spot where the Shah encamped on his way to Shikarpoor. There are three good wells about the vicinity; guidance, a date-tree near the lake, and one of them undergoing repairs: on the other side, in a grove of large tamarisk-trees, another well; and in a plantation, marked by a few plum-trees (Ber), one well, independent of the wells in the village, and the nullahs, over which the pucka bridge is built, which is going to decay, containing water all the year round, and teeming with fish. The road to be traversed is inundated ground when the overflow of the River Indus takes place; at present dry, and considered a good road, with the exception of a slight jungle. Oobowrah, distance from Subzul, is about thirteen miles.\n\nFrom Oobowrah, next stage is Bagoodra. The road, on the first onset, is over bogs of mud and water, and over a nullah with a wooden bridge. The jungle runs from here about a mile distant, after which a good road until about half a mile near the village of Mammadpoor; before reaching this, you pass a lake and the village of Rajunpoor, and Sooe to the left, distance about three-quarters of a mile from the road, and Zig, one mile; also a garden and well. Leaving Mammadpoor, you meet the small village of Koraeen and the Muswae drain, running on to Meerpoor; and on reaching Bagoodra, a nullah is crossed: distance from Oobowrah, thirteen miles. The encamping-ground is on the south of the village, having the command of five good wells of water, and where the Shah once encamped.\n\nSurhad is about nine miles' distance from Bagoodra, and, after leaving a jungle, runs for about one mile until it reaches Tutta Malna; after which a slight jungle until reaching the drain, when a pretty thick one commences to near the village. A well, and a few habitations of shepherds, with the village of Janpoor, is seen to the right. A good encamping-ground, with more than nine wells in the neighbourhood. Shah Shooja encamped here.\n\nGotkee from Surbad is about nine miles; a pretty good road almost all the way. About the midway is a canal thirty feet broad, but rendering no obstacle, and perfectly dry. There are also two small drains to be passed before reaching Gotkee.\n\nFrom Gotkee to the next stage is Dadoola; distance about thirteen miles; direction south-west $70^\\circ$, passing three villages\u2014Bammoowala, Bhisatee, and Malloodee; all the way a slight jungle, which can soon be cleared with a little trouble. The encamping-ground is on the north side of the village, having the use of three wells on the lands. This part of the country is well peopled, and cultivation is getting on prosperously.\nThence, Choonga, after passing Bhelar and a drain, which should be avoided by treading on the east side; the road is free from jungle: direction, south-west 64\u00b0. This village is situated on the dund and deep water which runs on to Azeepoor and Hoosein Belee. The encamping-ground had better be on the bank of the dund, which is about ten, twelve, and fourteen feet high; the road leads on the bank and over jungle, and in one place over a cotton field, on to Azeepoor, which is also near the river; but the ferry, commonly known by the name of Azeepoor-ka Pattan, is at the village of Hoosein Belee. Azeepoor, from Choonga, is about four miles distant.\n\nThe next halting-place is Hoosein Belee; at the ferry, after crossing a deserted dund, completely dry at the road, and some small jungle. There are two streams at the present ferry, one the dund, about 150 feet broad, with two, three, and four feet water; the best is an extensive one. Two boats ply here, one on each stream, and people land on the Bet, having to go about a mile and a half, when they again embark, and land on the other side. The two ferries made here is a matter of choice of the boatmen, to save themselves the trouble of plying to a long distance, for there is a good ferry higher up, where the army should cross.\n\nThe Indus, on the western bank, contains water twelve, sixteen, and eighteen feet, and at the centre stream, more than thirty and forty feet deep, with a strong running current, near the Bet (an island), ten, twelve, and eighteen feet water; and, on the east bank, four, six, and eight feet water. There are two villages situated on the northern bank of the river, named Syud Ameer Mohamed and Phoolooda-got. Crossing the ferry, the place of encampment pitched on is at the village of Got Amil, about a mile from the river, and in a fine plain; the river water is used here, and there is but one small temporary well.\n\nFrom Got-Amil, taking a direction north-west 80\u00b0, about a mile on the road, is the small village of Motar-mar, and then, about half a mile further, is a good drain, over which is a temporary bridge, all shattered; horsemen are obliged to keep to the left, and pass the drain, taking the same direction, and leaving Rubbun and Enjmut to the left, the latter a comfortable village. You pass a small jungle on to Kaee, where is the encamping-ground of the army on the south of the village. The difficulty here to be experienced is from the well-water, which is not good.\n\nLeaving Kaee, the direction varies to north-west 60\u00b0. Distance from Got-Amil to this place is little more than twelve miles. Sbikarpoor is the next stage, before coming to which you pass through a good path-road, on both sides free from jungle, and, after reaching Lubanna, you pass the Scinde canal. Lubanna is a village under Meer Ali Moorad, and to appearance, the inhabitants are in a comfortable way; patches of cultivation mark the road on to Shikarpoor. Distance from Kaee nearly twelve miles.\n## ROUTE through SINDE, BELOOCHISTAN, KHORASSAN, to KANDAHAR.\n\n| STAGES                  | Distances | REMARKS
