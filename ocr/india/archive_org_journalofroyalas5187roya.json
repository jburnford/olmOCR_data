I.\u2014Two J\u0101takas. The original P\u0101li Text, with an English Translation. By V. Fausb\u00f6ll.\n\n[Read February 17, 1870.]\n\nThe two J\u0101takas I here lay before the public contain, as will be seen, two fables which, in the tale that forms the framework of the second book of the Pancatantra, were combined into one. Only the main features, however, are the same, the details differing greatly; and the same is the case in all the other tales which the J\u0101takas have in common with the Pancatantra and the Hitopade\u00e7a. But, as the MSS. of these two works disagree so much that there are almost as many texts as there are MSS. (\"ut p\u0153ne quot codices, tot textus esse dicere possis,\" Kosegarten, p. vi), new editions of both of them, based on the oldest MSS. that can be found in India, would be of great value; and if once the oldest MS. in existence had been discovered, I should particularly recommend its publication without any alloy from other MSS., that we might be sure we have one clear, self-consistent text. I think that if this had been done, the similarity between the Singhalese (P\u0101li) and the continental (Sanscrit) fables would appear greater; the Pancatantra being originally, as Prof. Benfey has clearly shown, a Buddhistic work. If we look at the first of the two following fables, it will be seen that the truth to be expounded is the old one, couched by Sallust\n(Jugurtha 10), in the words, *concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia maxumae dilabuntur*, or in modern form: union is strength, disunion weakness. Only the first half of this truth, however, comes clear out in the Pancatantra and the Hitopade\u00e7a; the other half seems, by the combination of our two distinct fables into one, to have been gradually obscured, so as to disappear entirely in the Hitopade\u00e7a in the cardinal verse. In order to make this clearer, I here give the different forms of this verse from our J\u00e1taka, the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, the Pancatantra and the Hitopade\u00e7a in juxtaposition:\n\n**J\u00e1t. 33.**\n\n*Sammadam\u00e1na gacchanti j\u00e1lam \u00e1d\u00e1ya pakkhino, yad\u00e1 te vivadissanti tad\u00e1 chinti me va\u1e63am.*\n\n**Mah\u00e1bh. 5, 2461.**\n\nP\u00e1\u00e7am ekam ubh\u00e1v-etau sahitau harato mama, yatra vai vivadishyete tatra me va\u00e7am eshyatah.\n\n**Pancatantra**, Kosegart. p. 106.\n\nJ\u00e1lam \u00e1d\u00e1ya gacchanti sahas\u00e1 paxino 'py-am\u00ed, y\u00e1vac ca vivadishyante patishyanti, na sam\u00e7ayah.\n\n**Hitopade\u00e7a**, Johnson, p. 10.\n\nSamhat\u00e1s tu haranty-ete mama j\u00e1lam viha\u1e45gam\u00e1h, yad\u00e1 tu nipatishyanti va\u00e7am eshyanti me tad\u00e1.\n\nBy this it is easily seen how the original idea has by degrees been mutilated. As Kosegarten has unhappily chosen the reading *sahas\u00e1* for *samhat\u00e1h*, and consequently the former part of the main idea is lost, so, on the other hand, in the Hitopade\u00e7a, the latter part has disappeared, *nipatishyanti* having been put in the text instead of *vivadishyante*, mistakes that arose from the authors' combining the two fables into one, without regard for the latter part of the former fable, according to which the quails by quarrelling fall into the fowler's hands. In conclusion, I may remark that a third more formal expression (*va\u00e7am eshyanti me tad\u00e1*) has been dropped in the Pancatantra, but kept in the three others.\n\nFor constituting the text of J\u00e1taka 33 I have only had one MS, the Singhalese one at Copenhagen; I have, therefore, in this J\u00e1taka followed the orthography commonly used in Singhalese MSS. For the Kurungaj\u00e1taka, I have had one more, namely, the Burmese MS. at the India Office Library,\nwhich has been mentioned in my \"Five J\u00e1takas;\" and I have therefore, in the latter J\u00e1taka, followed the common orthography as regards the use of the nasals.\n\n33.

This (dispute) will appear in the Ku\u1e47\u00e1la-J\u00e1taka. At that time, namely, the Master admonishing (his) relations (said): Emperors! dispute between relatives mutually is, surely not becoming; even (some) animals which had conquered (their) enemies at the time of concord, when quarrelling, suffered great destruction, (and) so having said, (when) called upon by (his) royal relatives, he told a story:\n\nIn (times) past, when Brahmadatta reigned in B\u00e1r\u00e1\u1e47as\u00ed, Bodhisatta, having been born a quail, lived in the wood with an attendance of many thousands of quails. Then a quail-hunter, after going to their dwelling-place, (and) having counterfeited the cry of quails, and seen that they had assembled, threw (his) net over them, (and) after drawing it together at the sides (and) uniting all in one (heap), he filled his basket, went to (his) house, sold them, and (thus) had his livelihood with that money. But one day Bodhisatta said to those quails, \"This fowler destroys our kin; I know a means by (employing) which he will not be able to catch us. Henceforth as soon as the net is thrown over us by him, you, having each of you put (his) head into one mesh of the net (and) lifted the net (and) carried (it) to whatever place you choose, cast (it) on a thorn-bush. This being (done) we shall escape each from under his place.\" (Saying) Very good! they all promised (to do so). The next day when the net had been thrown over (them), then having lifted the net in the way mentioned by Bodhisatta (and) having cast it on a thorn-bush, they themselves fled away from underneath. While the fowler was extricating the net from the bush, it had become dark. He went away empty-handed. From the following day the quails act in the same way. And he until sunset (being busy) extricating the net, without having got anything, goes to (his) house empty-handed. Then his wife,\nbeing angry, said, \"You come empty-handed every day; I think that outside (this place) there must be (another) for thy sustenance.\" The fowler (said), \"Dear! there is no other place for my sustenance; those quails indeed live in harmony, (and) taking (away with them) the net (as soon as it is) thrown by me, they cast (it) on a thorn-bush and go (away). But surely they will not always live in harmony. Thou must not grieve. When they fall into disunion, then, having taken them all, I shall come and make your face smile;\" (and) thus saying he repeated this stanza to (his) wife:\n\n\"(While) agreeing the birds go (away)\ncarrying off the net,\nbut when they quarrel\nthey will then fall into my power.\"\n\nWhen a short time had passed, one quail, descending on the pasture-ground, unawares trod on the head of another. The other was angry (and said), \"Who trod on my head?\" and although the first said, \"Be not angry, I trod (on it) unawares,\" yet he was angry. They, again and again talking (together), quarrelled with each other, saying, \"(It is) thou, I suppose, (that) liftest the net.\" While they were quarrelling, Bodhisatta thought, \"For those who quarrel there is no safety, now they will not lift the net, then they will incur great destruction, the fowler will have a (good) chance. I cannot stay in this place (any longer).\" So he took his retinue and went elsewhere. But the fowler, after a little while, came and counterfeited the cry of the quails, and when they had assembled he threw the net over (them). Then one quail said, \"While lifting the net, the feathers on thy head fell off, now lift (it again).\" Another said, \"While lifting the net, thy wings on both sides dropped, now lift (it again).\" Thus while they were saying, \"Lift (the net again),\" the fowler threw (his) net, and after uniting all in one (heap), and filling (his) bag, he went home and made (his) wife smile.\n\nThe Master (said), \"Thus, O Emperor! the dispute of relatives is not becoming, dispute is the root of destruction; (and) so (saying and) having given this moral instruction, he wound up the J\u00e1taka by saying: \"At that time the unwise\nquail was Devadatta, but the wise quail I.\u201d\u2014The Sammodam\u00e1na-Birth.\n\nNOTES ON JATAKA 33.\n\n*Nigrodha*, Abhidh\u00e1n. by Subh\u00fat\u00ed, vv. 551, 1042; in Sanscrit nyagrodha, ficus religiosa. In J. Lindley\u2019s \u201cA Natural System of Botany,\u201d 2 Edit. p. 177, we read the following passage: \u201cThe celebrated banyan-tree of India is Ficus religiosa. Prince Maximilian, of Wied Neuwied, says that the colossal wild fig-trees are one of the most grateful presents of nature to hot countries; the shade of such a magnificent tree refreshes the traveller when he reposes under its incredibly wide-spreading branches, with their dark green shining foliage. The fig-trees of all hot countries have generally very thick trunks, with extremely strong boughs, and a prodigious crown.\u201d That *cumb\u0101ta* means a *wreath* may be seen from J. 471, where we find the following passage: \u201cs\u00e1 tesam gatak\u00e1le n\u00e1n\u00e1-pupph\u00e1n\u00ed gahetv\u00e1 pupphacumb\u0101takam katv\u00e1,\u201d etc. The word is still preserved in the Mahr\u00e1th\u00ed, where *cumbala* or *cumbhala* means a circle or ring of cloth, to be put on the head under a load to be carried; see Molesworth. *Tiracch\u00e1na* (from tira\u00e7ca + ana), an animal, Abhidh\u00e1n. v. 648. *Pacc\u00e1mitta*, see \u201cFive J\u00e1takas,\u201d p. 23. *Vattaka*, S. vartaka, a sort of quail, Wilson. *Vassita*, S. v\u00e1\u00e7ita, Abhidh\u00e1n. v. 130. *Madd*, S. mard (m\u1e5b\u1e0d); see B\u00f6htl. and Roth\u2019s S. W. *Pacchi* means, according to Abhidh\u00e1n. v. 524. a basket. I am at a loss to find a corresponding Sanscrit word. In elucidation thereof, I quote the following passages, J\u00e1taka 78 : mah\u00e1jano pacchipasibbak\u00e1d\u00edni gahetv\u00e1 gehadv\u00e1re sannipati.

I suppose, as Prof. Westerg has suggested to me, that the words I\nhave put between brackets have been repeated by a mistake of the transcribers. *Sammodam\u00e1na*, rejoicing together, agreeing, living in harmony; compare Burnouf's Lotus, p. 316, where *sammodam\u00e1no* is explained by *avivadam\u00e1no*, not disputing, not quarrelling. In elucidation of these two verbs, I quote the following verses from J. 467:\n\n```\nIcc-eva phandano isam\niso ca pana phandanam\nam\u00f1amam\u00f1am viv\u00e1dena\nam\u00f1amam\u00f1am agh\u00e1tayum.\nEvam eva manussesu\nviv\u00e1do yattha j\u00e1yati\nmay\u00faranaccam naccanti\nyath\u00e1 ne isaphandan\u00e1.\nTam vo vad\u00e1mi bhaddam vo,\ny\u00e1vant' ettha sam\u00e1gat\u00e1\nsammodatha m\u00e1 vivadittha\nm\u00e1 hotha isaphandan\u00e1.\n```\n\n*Sabbev\u00e1d\u00e1ya*, I suppose, must be dissolved into sabbe eva \u00e1d\u00e1ya, and therefore written sabbe v\u00e1d\u00e1ya, as the commentary has *te gaht\u00e9v\u00e1*. *Ehinti*, see Dhammapadam, p. 369. *Katip\u00e1ha*, see \"Five J\u00e1t.\" p. 26. *Viv\u00e1dake*, I think the transcriber must here have made a mistake, and that we are to read: *viv\u00e1dakesu*. *Sotthi*, see Dhpd. p. 363. *Bhariyam h\u00e1sayam\u00e1no*, the MS. has h\u00e1sam\u00e1no. *Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja* I suppose to be a mistake of the transcriber, instead of mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1no, as at the beginning of the J\u00e1taka. *Anusandhim gha\u1e6detv\u00e1* occurs often at the end of a story in the same connexion as here, but as yet I have not been able to make out the meaning of this phrase. I suppose, however, it means something like making application, bringing the story told to bear upon the then existing circumstances. *Samodh\u00e1nesi*, see \"Five J\u00e1t.\" p. 30.\n\n---\n\n**201.

Kurungamigaj\u0101takam.\n\n\u201cTherefore the leathern trap.\u201d This the Master related, while living at Veluvana, in reference to Devadatta. For at that time the Master, having heard that Devadatta endeavoured to kill (him, said,) bhikkhus, not only now Devadatta endeavours to kill me, (but) also formerly he endeavoured (to do so, and) so having said he told a story:\n\nIn (times) past, while Brahmadatta reigned in B\u0101r\u0101nas\u012b,\nBodhisatta, having become a Kurunga-deer, took up (his) abode in the wood, in a thicket not far from a lake. At the top of a tree not far from that lake sat a Woodpecker, and in the lake there lived a Tortoise. Thus those three companions lived pleasantly together. Then a Deer-hunter, roaming in the wood, having seen Bodhisatta\u2019s footmarks near a water-pool, (and) having placed a trap made of leather (thongs, and as strong) as an iron-chain, went (his way). Bodhisatta, having come to drink water, (and being) caught in the trap during the first watch (of the night), shrieked (frantically) as a prisoner. At his shriek the Woodpecker, coming down from the top of the tree, and the Tortoise out of the water, consulted (together, saying) what is to be done? Then the Woodpecker, addressing the Tortoise (said), \u201cFriend, you have teeth, cut this trap; I will go and manage (it so) that he shall not come; thus by the efforts made by us two our companion will obtain life;\u201d (and) explaining this matter (he) pronounced the first stanza:\n\n1. \u201cTherefore the leathern trap\n   Cut with thy teeth, O Tortoise!\n   I will manage (it) so\n   That the Hunter shall not come.\u201d\n\nThe Tortoise began to gnaw at the leather-thongs. The Woodpecker went to the village where the Hunter dwelt. The Hunter at dawn, having taken (his) hunting-knife, went out. The Bird, perceiving that he was about to go out, shrieked aloud, shaking (his) wings, and struck him in the face when he was going out at the front-door. The Hunter (said to himself), \u201cI have been struck by a bird of bad omen,\u201d (and) so (saying) he returned, lay down a little (while), and then got up again and took (his) knife. The Bird (thought), \u201cthis (man) went out the first (time) by the front-door, now he will go out by the back-door,\u201d (and) seeing this he went and sat down at the back-door. But the Hunter thought, \u201cwhen I went out by the front-door, I saw a bird of bad omen, now I will go out at the back-door,\u201d (and) so (thinking) he went out by the back-door. The Bird again shrieking aloud went and struck (him) in the face. The\nHunter, again struck by the bird of bad omen, (thought), \"this (bird) will not allow me to go out,\" (and) so returning he lay down until daybreak, and (then) at the dawn of morning took (his) knife and went out. The Bird went away hastily, and told Bodhisatta that the Hunter was coming. At this moment, with the exception of one thong, the other thongs had been cut by the Tortoise. But his teeth looked as if they were going to fall out, (and his) mouth was soiled with blood. Bodhisatta, seeing that the Hunter had taken (his) knife, and was coming on with the speed of lightning, burst that thong and entered the wood. The Bird (now) set himself on the top of a tree. But the Tortoise from weakness lay down there. The Hunter, after throwing the Tortoise into (his) bag, fastened (it) to a post. Bodhisatta, on (his) return, seeing (what had taken place) and knowing that the Tortoise had been caught (thought), \"I will preserve (my) companion's life,\" (and) so, feigning to be weak, he appeared before the Hunter. He (thought), \"this (deer) must be weak, I will kill him,\" (and) so, taking (his) knife, he followed (him). Bodhisatta, neither going very far (away) nor very near, entered the wood, taking him (with him). (But) when he knew that he had gone a great distance he changed his pace and went (back) with the rapidity of the wind another way, (and) when he had thrown up the bag into the air, with (his) horn, and let it fall and be torn on the ground, he drew out the Tortoise. The Woodpecker descended from the tree. (Then) Bodhisatta said admonishingly to the two (others), \"I got life through you; by you has been done unto me what ought to be done to a companion; now when the Hunter comes he will seize you, therefore, friend Woodpecker! take your children and go to another (place), and you, friend Tortoise! go into the water.\" They did so. The Master having become enlightened, pronounced the second stanza:\n\n2. \"The Tortoise went into the water,\n   The Deer entered the wood,\n   The Woodpecker from the top of the tree\n   Carried (his) children far away.\"\nThe Hunter coming (back) to that place, (and) not seeing any one, took (his) torn sack and went to his house, seized with distress. The three companions, on the other hand, without breaking off (their mutual) confidence during life, (at last) passed (away) according to (their) deeds.\n\nThe Master having given this moral instruction, wound up the J\u00e1taka thus: \u201cAt that time the Hunter was Devadatta, the Woodpecker S\u00e1riputta, the Tortoise Moggall\u00e1na, but the Kurunga-deer (was) myself.\u201d The Kurungadeer-Birth.\n\nNOTES ON JATAKA 201.\n\n*Ingha*, see Abhidh\u00e1n. v. 1157 (codane) and Clough\u2019s Pali Gram. p. 72. *Vaddha*, S. vardhra. *Parisakkati*, compare Dhammapadam p. 331. *Kuru\u1e45ga*, S. kura\u1e45ga. *Gumba*, see note on J\u00e1t. 33. *Satapatta*, S. \u00e7atapatra. *Luddaka*, see Five J\u00e1t. p. 38. *Padavala\u00f1ja* I think to be the correctest form of this word, but it is sometimes written padavala\u00f1ja, compare Preface to Dhpd. p. viii.; in this place B has vala\u00f1ca, and C vala\u00f1cha.

II.\u2014On an Ancient Buddhist Inscription at Keu-yung kwan, in North China. By A. Wylie.\n\nTravellers from the city of Peking to the town of Kalgan on the great wall of China, must make the journey by the rugged defile known as the Nankow Pass. Five miles north of the entrance, where the village of Nankow stands, is the smaller village of Keu-yung kwan. Fortifications there run up the steep slopes of the mountains on both sides of the valley; and besides arched gateways at the two ends of the village, the highway passes under a limestone archway of a much more striking appearance. This is covered with mythological and symbolic sculptures of obviously Indian origin. The tradition of the natives in the neighbourhood asserts it to have been the basement story of a pagoda which stood there; and the name by which it is still designated, \u904e\u8857\u5854 Kw\u014d keae t\u2019a, \u201cPagoda crossing the street,\u201d bears out the statement. We are told that this pagoda, though erected for the benefit of the locality, proved an object of such terror to the superstitious Mongols, coming south from their native wilds, that they could not be induced to pass under the ominous-looking structure; and thus it was found necessary in the early part of the Ming dynasty, to remove the upper stories of the erection; the policy of the government being to conciliate and attract these wild nomades.\n\nKeu-yung kwan was once a place of much greater pretension and importance than it is at present; and it can boast of historical memories of considerable interest; not the least being the fact that there Genghis khan was successfully resisted in his attempts to force the pass.\n\nSeveral Europeans who have passed that way, have noticed the village and the archway, in recounting their travels. Father Gerbillon, who was there on his way to Mongolia in 1688, says\u2014\u201cThe village might pass for a little town. The\ngate by which it is entered is very like a triumphal arch. It is all marble, and about thirty feet thick, with figures in half relief up to the spring of the arch.\"\u00b9 The same father, returning that way in the suite of the emperor in 1697, remarks:\u2014\"The heir apparent, accompanied by five of his brothers, and some magnates of the empire who had remained at Peking, came to meet the emperor in the middle of the Pass, in a village, named Kiu y\u00fcm quan, where they remained some time.\"\u00b2 Bell of Antermony, who accompanied the Russian embassy to Peking in 1720, speaks of it as the town of Zulin guang, where he says they passed the night of November 15th.\u00b3 Timkowski, who headed a similar embassy in 1820, speaks thus of the place:\u2014\"Here the road begins to be very difficult, especially for carriages, and does not change for a distance of about five verst, as far as the fort of Kiu young (kouan), the principal defence of this passage. The interior of the middle gate is ornamented with figures of heros sculptured on the walls.\"\u2074\n\nNone of the preceding writers however, nor others who had been there, seem to have thought it worth while to direct attention to the inscription which is found on this archway; and the first notice of it brought before the European public, so far as I am aware, was in a paper by myself, published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1860.\u2075 I had found it registered in a Chinese work on stone inscriptions, published towards the close of last century.\u2076\n\nWhile on my return from England to China, via Siberia and Mongolia, in 1863, I first saw this arch.\u2077 At that time\n\n\u00b9 Du Halde. \"Description G\u00e9ographique, Historique, Chronologique, Politique, et Physique de la Chine, etc.\" Hague.

J. Edkins, of Peking, in anticipation of my arrival,\nI could only succeed in getting an impression on paper of a portion of the inscription on the west side of the archway; which was exhibited at the first meeting of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at Shanghai, in 1864. A short paper on the same was published in the Society's Journal for that year.\u00b9\n\nhad come to the Mongolian plateau to meet me, but being a fortnight too early, he left a note for me at Kalgan, which, however, I never received. In that note he called my attention to the inscription on the arch, which he had observed in passing.\n\nAn engraving of the arch has recently been published by Professor Pumelly, who saw it in the spring of 1863. In his new work, \"Across America and Asia,\" he thus describes the place:\u2014\"The next morning, leaving the plain, we entered the narrow valley, winding for several miles through a desolate gorge, enclosed by lofty walls and yellow cliffs of limestone. The mountain torrent, which at certain seasons dashes wildly through the valley, makes the construction of a durable road almost impossible, and it was only with difficulty, and with faith in the sure feet of our horses, that we managed slowly to pick our way through the long and narrow valley of sharp-edged boulders and masses of fallen rock. After several miles of this work we came to a point where the remains of an ancient road rising some distance above the bed of the valley was preserved along the mountain side. Ascending this by a long flight of steps, of highly polished blocks of limestone, granite, and porphyry, we passed through a gateway in an inner branch of the great wall, and came soon after to a beautiful white marble arch built during the Chin dynasty. This structure is remarkable from the fact that while its blocks are cut for a circular arch, the inner surfaces are hewn to produce a ceiling of semi-hexagonal form. It is interesting also to the student of the Chinese language, from the fact that the interior contains inscriptions in an ancient Chinese character. As Dr. Pogojeff wished to photograph this monument, we remained here till the next day, etc.\"\n\nIn the Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal, vol. ii. p. 190, are the following remarks in the journal of a missionary lady who lately passed Keu-yung kwan on her way to Kalgan:\u2014\"The inner line of the great wall is at the entrance to the Nankho, and three or four branches cross it. We passed through ten gateways. These are double, as is customary with cities. The wall is dilapidated in some places, but the gateways are all solidly built, and in good repair. One was very fine, having much carved work, and inscriptions in six different languages. One of these European scholars cannot read.\"\n\n\u00b9 Journal of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, New series, No. 1, pp. 133\u2013136.\nAs there stated, the inscription is engraved in the characters of six different nations, and covers the greater part of the inner facing of the structure on both sides, from the basement to the spring of the arch. Two of the parts are inscribed in horizontal lines at the top, in antique Devanagari and Tibetan characters respectively, twenty feet long on each wall. Below these are four compartments inscribed respectively in Mongol, Ouigour, Neuchih and Chinese characters, all in vertical lines.\n\nIn the spring of 1867, when on a visit to the north of China, I succeeded in completing my impression of the four last-named parts of the inscription, but could not get the Sanscrit and Tibetan portions, on account of their great height from the ground. At a subsequent period, however, these were procured by Mr. Edkins, and he has kindly sent me a hand tracing by a Chinese, from his impression.\n\nIt will be seen that the great interest of this inscription is the large and correct specimen it offers of the Neuchih character, the national writing of the Kin dynasty Tartars, the knowledge of which is now absolutely lost in China, and very few specimens are known to exist or to be accessible.\n\nThe great age of this piece of art however,\u2014more than five centuries,\u2014taken into consideration, it is not surprising that it has suffered much from various causes; large portions of the stone have dropped out in many places; the surface, especially towards the base, is much chipped and defaced, and in some places the characters have become so filled up with hard matter, as scarcely to give any legible impression on the paper. The numerous lacun\u00e6 thus produced form the chief difficulty in the decipherment.\n\nA slight comparison of the different parts was sufficient to show that they were all transcripts of a Sanscrit original. On the eastern wall the correspondence for the greater part is tolerably close throughout. That on the western side is much less regular, no one version being the exact counterpart of any other, gaps and redundancies occurring in many places, especially in the latter part.\n\nThe present paper then will be occupied specially with the\neastern side of the archway, leaving the opposite one as a subject for future investigation; as I find each side is complete in itself.\n\nOutside the original inscription, there is an intimation in smaller Chinese characters, on the right-hand border, towards the top, to the effect that the structure was \"repaired with funds given by the meritorious and believing official Lin P\u2019oo-heen, on the 15th day of the 5th month of the year 1445.\" It is to be noticed, that this is exactly a century after the date of the original inscription, 1345, which by a singular accident is preserved, in a line where little else is legible.\n\nAs the Chinese characters were more easily intelligible to me than any of the others, and consequently promised the readiest key to the mystery, I naturally turned to that part of the inscription first. Unfortunately I found it specially faulty and illegible; and it was necessary to supply large lacun\u00e6 by analogy, and with the aid derivable from the transcripts in the other characters. There are twenty-one columns of large characters, which are succeeded by twenty columns of a smaller size; and with the exception of the Sanscrit, which consists entirely of large characters, all the other compartments have, like the Chinese, part in large characters and part in small. Of the large character portion, which it was at once obvious was a mere transcript of Sanscrit sounds, I have lately found another rendering in a Chinese ritual, the \u7985\u9580\u65e5\u8aa6 Shen mun jih sung, \"Daily recitations of the Shen sect;\"\u00b9 in which it is spelt out with a set of characters differing almost entirely from those on the inscription; so that it is only by the phonetic approximation that the identity can be detected. The title of the piece, as given in the ritual,\u2014but omitted in the inscription,\u2014is \u4f5b\u9802\u5c0a\u52dd\u5927\u9640\u7f85\u5c3c Fuh ting tsun shing ta to lo ne, \"Great dh\u0101rani of the honoured diadem on Buddha's cranium.\"\u00b2 It may be remarked that in every instance where a\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Edkins identifies the Shen sect with the Jains of India.\n\n\u00b2 In another ritual, the \u745c\u4f3d\u7130\u53e3 Yu kea yen kow, \"Flaming mouths of the Yoga,\" in the possession of W. Lockhart,\ncompound character is used in the Sanscrit,\u2014and such instances are very numerous,\u2014the same is expressed by two Chinese characters in the column, followed by two smaller ones, \u4e8c\u5408 \\( urh \\) \\( h\u014d \\), \u201ctwo combined,\u201d placed horizontally. This practice is invariable, both in the inscription and in the ritual. The copy in the ritual is marked off by stops, into words or clauses throughout. By the discovery of this duplicate, I have been enabled to fill up the gaps in the Chinese part of the inscription almost without the chance of error.\n\nHaving ascertained that all the different portions were transcripts or transliterations of a Sanscrit original, the importance of restoring and analyzing this original was apparent; and for this purpose I have turned to account the tracing sent to me by Mr. Edkins. This consists of five horizontal lines of characters, each two inches in depth and twenty feet in length. Besides being in an obsolete form of the Devanagari, the Chinese copyist, as might be expected, has made numerous errors in his endeavours to extricate the complex characters from the half-obliterated legend on the stone. So great was the confusion thus produced, that it would have been hopeless for any but a Sanscrit scholar to have succeeded in restoring the half-obscured forms. At this stage I was under obligation to Dr. E. Haas, of the British Museum, who kindly identified the greater number of the characters for me. Having this clue to start with, by a comparison of the several transcripts, I was able to make an approximate restoration of the whole, and wrote out the same in English letters. Being in G\u00f6ttingen shortly after, I showed this transcript to Professor Benfey, who readily gave me a partial translation, and pointed out many errors in the proposed restoration; although a failure of eyesight, from which he was at the time suffering, prevented him entering so minutely into the details, as he otherwise would willingly have done. These hints however put me in the way of\n\nEsq., the same is given with the abbreviated title \u5c0a\u52dd\u5492 Tsun shing chow, \u201cPrayer to the honoured diadem.\u201d\nmaking numerous corrections; and after repeated amendments, in which Dr. Haas has taken much trouble to assist me, I am indebted to that gentleman for a complete and independent translation of the whole; which is subjoined hereafter the phonetic transcript. A few places, and only a few, have persistently refused to submit to the rigour of grammatical laws; and it is not surprising, in the case of a dead language being traditionally preserved for centuries among a people by whom it is not understood, that a few errors should creep in. It is rather to be wondered at, and indicates a remarkable veneration for the sounds of the sacred language, that the text as preserved should be able to give out such a complete and intelligible meaning.\n\nTRANSLITERATION.\u00b9\n\nOm namo bhagavate sarvatrailokya prativi\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ya buddh\u0101ya te nama\u1e25 tadyath\u0101 om bh\u016br om bh\u016br om \u015bodhaya vi\u1e63odhaya vi\u1e63odhaya vi\u1e63odhay\u0101sama samantavabh\u0101s\u0101varan\u0101 gatigaganasvabh\u0101vavi\u1e63uddhe abhishinchena\u00b2 tu m\u0101\u1e41 sarvatath\u0101gata sugata varavachanam-rit\u0101bhishekair mah\u0101mudr\u0101\u00b3 mantrapadaih \u0101hara \u0101hara mam\u0101yu\u1e25 sant\u0101ra\u1e47i \u015bodhaya \u015bodhaya vi\u1e63odhaya vi\u1e63odhaya gaganasvabh\u0101vavi\u1e63uddhe ushi\u1e63havijayapari\u1e63uddhe sahasra\u015ba\u1e41sa\u1e41ch\u014ddite sarvata-th\u0101gat\u0101valokini \u015batp\u0101ramit\u0101parip\u016brani sarvatath\u0101gatamatid\u0101sa\u1e41bh\u016bmipratishthite sarvatath\u0101gata\u1e25riday\u0101dhishth\u0101n\u0101dhishthhite mudre mudre mah\u0101mudrevajrak\u0101yasamhatanapari\u1e63uddhe sarvakarm\u0101varanavi\u1e63uddhe pratiniyartaya mam\u0101yu\u1e25 vi\u1e63uddhe sarvatath\u0101gatasamay\u0101dhishth\u0101n\u0101dhishthhite om muni muni mah\u0101muni vimuni vimuni mah\u0101vimuni,\u2074 mati mati mah\u0101mati mamati\u2075 sumatitath\u0101bh\u016bte ko\u1e6dipari\u1e63uddhe visbutabuddhi\u1e63uddhe\u2076 he he jaya jaya vijaya vijaya samara\n\n\u00b9 The italics represent the restorations, which are illegible in the Sanscrit.\n\u00b2 Dr. Haas corrects this to abhishinches.\n\u00b3 Dr. Haas adds m here.\n\u2074 Dr. Haas thinks the inscription is in error here, and that the preceding six words should end in ne instead of ni.\n\u2075 Dr. Haas thinks this word should be mah\u0101mati.\n\u2076 I understand that sbu is an impossible combination in Sanscrit; and although the Sanscrit character is missing on the stone, yet the several transcripts in the other characters are so distinct that I do not feel at liberty to abandon it.

But it may also be an abbreviation, indicative of the repetition of the whole formula.\" (Dr. Haas.)\nthe mysteries of that abstruse subject. Suffice it to say that, according to the general definition, they are certain mystical formul\u00e6, supposed to carry with them a magical influence in the recitation, and this influence is not simply dependent on their utterance as a whole, but is supposed to be inherent in the single words, and even in the separate letters of the forms. In a system where all the objects of sense are but so many ideas in a world of unreality, words constitute not merely names, but the actual essence of the things named; and the possession of the name is consequently the possession of the object. This may account for the incoherent and almost meaningless ejaculations observable throughout the inscription; and it is but a refinement of the same notion to attribute a similar virtue to the elements of which the words are made up. From words and letters, the same occult efficacy was transferred to symbols made by a particular placing of the fingers, which is called mudr\u0101, or \"the seal,\" and this appears to be personified here as an object of adoration.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe above translation seems to be tolerably near the meaning of the text; and although after every effort at reconstruction, a few grammatical solecisms still remain, yet I believe there are very few places now, where the original syllables are not correctly restored. It is indeed interesting to have an exact interpretation of the text; but the main thing for our present purpose, is to identify the vocables without error; and when once assured of the powers of the Sanscrit characters, we can proceed with confidence to the analysis and restoration of the several transliterations.\n\nThe dh\u0101rani concludes near the end of the fourth line on the stone, thus:\u2014\"with the words of mystic prayers (mantra). Sv\u0101h\u0101.\" The doxology that follows is only found in one of the transliterations. From the remarks of Burnouf on the subject,\\(^2\\) I am inclined to think that this concluding piece is the mantra alluded to in the final sentence of the dh\u0101rani.\n\n\\(^1\\) See Vassilief's \"Le Bouddisme,\" translated by La Comme, p. 141, passim.\n\n\\(^2\\) Introduction \u00e0 l'histoire du Bouddisme Indien, p. 540.\nIt may be remarked that the invocation *Om bh\u00fbr om sv\u00e2h\u00e2*, by which the Chinese and three of the others commence, is omitted in the Sanscrit.\n\nImmediately below the Sanscrit text is the transcript in three horizontal lines of Tibetan characters, below which are four lines of Tibetan in smaller characters. The Tibetan character being a direct derivative from the Devanagari,\\(^1\\) it might be expected that this would prove the most important of the transcripts for identifying the original text. Unfortunately however, the breaks in the face of the stone are so extensive, that not much more than half of the writing is preserved; and the indistinctness of that, probably, has led the copyist into so many errors and omissions, that the tracing serves for little more than mere hints; but it may in great part be corrected by the other transcripts. This contains the introductory invocation *Om bh\u00fbr om sv\u00e2h\u00e2*, and the *dh\u00e2rani* occupies about two lines and a third; the remaining portion being totally different from the Sanscrit, though it is evidently Sanscrit also.\n\nThe first of the vertical portions below the preceding, beginning from the left hand, is in that form of the Mongol known as the B\u00e2shpah\\(^2\\) alphabet. This consists of twenty lines in large characters, the lines succeeding from left to right; which are followed by eight lines of Mongolian in a smaller character. The transcript commences with the invocation *Om bh\u00fbr om sv\u00e2h\u00e2*, and contains the whole of the *dh\u00e2rani*, but nothing additional.\n\nAlthough the history of this alphabet and writing is dis-\n\n\\(^1\\) The Tibetan characters were invented by Thumi Sambhota, the Prime Minister of Srongtsan Gampo, King of Tibet, from the Devanagari alphabet, about the middle of the seventh century.\u2014Schlagintweit.

Pallas writes the name Pagba. Remusat gives it Phaspa, Paspa, B\u00e2schpah, and Pa-sse-pa, in different places of his Recherches sur les langues Tartares. Klaproth uses Bh\u00e2chbah, as the Tibetan transcript of the original Sanscrit. Pauthier uses Pa-sse-pa.\ntinctly related in the Chinese annals, yet its actual existence seems, up to a very recent period, to have been a matter of doubt with European writers.\n\nChinese history tells us that the emperor Kubla commissioned the Tibetan lama B\u00e2shpah to construct an alphabet or syllabary specially adapted to the Mongol language. His task was completed, and the alphabet initiated for public use by an imperial decree in 1269. Schools for the study of this character were also instituted the same year. Several notices on record lead us to believe that the Chinese never took willingly to the use of this alphabet; but there is no doubt it was the official writing during the Yuen dynasty; and it appears to be the one known as the Mongolian character in the Chinese records of that period.\n\nPallas gives the same account of B\u00e2shpah's invention,\\(^1\\) derived apparently from a Mongol source; and the last plate in his work contains what he calls a specimen of B\u00e2shpah's square character,\\(^2\\) but he does not tell us where he got it. That plate has been repeatedly quoted as the first specimen of B\u00e2shpah's alphabet published in Europe; but I am very doubtful if B\u00e2shpah had anything to do with the character there given,\\(^3\\) or if Pallas had ever seen the writing invented\n\n\\(^1\\) Sammlungen historischer Nachrichten \u00fcber die Mongolischen V\u00f6lkerschaften, vol. ii. p. 358.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. vol. ii. plate 22.\n\n\\(^3\\) When on a visit to the great lamasary Yung-ho-kung, in Peking, I observed in one of the temples a pall inscribed in the common Tibetan character, with a horizontal heading in a character which was unknown to me. I thought it of sufficient interest to take a copy of it, which I give here:\n\n```\nom a \u00e1 e \u00e8 i \u00ed u \u00f9 o \u00f4 k kh ng ch ch' gn t th n\n```\n\n```\np ph m y r l b v j s ya g ds ds' w sh h' b\n```\n\n```\nri ri li li kr\n```\n\nSubsequently, when I saw Pallas' work for the first time, I was surprised to find my copy almost identical with his plate, except\nby that celebrated lama; for it will be observed that all the known examples resemble much more closely the common Tibetan character, than does that of Pallas, which is evidently a modification of the Scharr form.\n\nIn the Appendix to Courtin's \"Encyclop\u00e9die Moderne,\" Klaproth, in an article on \"Grammaire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale,\" gives an alphabet which he calls \"Square Landsha,\"\u00b9 being nearer in resemblance to B\u00e2shpah's than the preceding; but though some have taken it to be identical with his invention, I do not believe there is any direct connection between the two.\n\nSchmidt seems to ignore the existence of a separate alphabet under the name of B\u00e2shpah, as having been ever used among the Mongols.\u00b2\n\nRemusat says this alphabet was never used out of Tibet, notwithstanding the reiterated orders of the emperors.\u00b3 He promises to give an exemplar of the alphabet in his second volume, from the Suh hung keen lu\u1e25, together with some explanatory details; but the second volume never appeared. Never having seen an instance of the employment of this character, he seems to have been unable to divest himself of the idea, that the invention of B\u00e2shpah was nothing more than the application to the Mongolian language, of the common characters used by the Tibetans at the present day. That hypothesis however is totally refuted by the present inscription, where we have the Tibetan portion in the identical character used by that people now, and the Mongol portion in the B\u00e2shpah character.\n\nKlaproth, while arguing for this writing having been used in China, says there are a great many medals of Kubla khan in existence, of which the legend is entirely or in part in the\n\nthat he gives an additional portion at the beginning and end; but he gives no explanation of what are the characters. I conclude, from examination, that they are simply the alphabet, and have identified the greater number with tolerable probability; believing that the additional ones given by Pallas are compounds.\n\n\u00b9 Plate 7.\n\u00b2 Forschungen im Gebiete der \u00e4lteren religi\u00f6sen, politischen, und literarischen Bildungsgeschichte der V\u00f6lker Mittel Asiens.\n\u00b3 Recherches sur les langues Tartares, p. 193.\nsquare characters. These seem to be the only evidence that he was able to adduce of the use of this character in China. While I think it very doubtful however, whether there be any such medals of the reign of Kubla, it is very easy to understand how Klaproth should have been led into such a mistake. I have never seen any, or a description of any in Chinese books on medals; but I have a number of coins in the B\u00e2shpah character, dating at various periods from 1308 to 1354.\n\nI have seen several stone slabs inscribed with this character, and notices of a good many more, the present one dating so late as 1345. In 1307, it is recorded that Polo Timor, a high dignitary, presented to the emperor a copy of the Heaou king, or \"Book of Filial piety,\" written in the B\u00e2shpah character, which the monarch ordered to be printed and circulated. I am only aware of one little book in that character having survived to the present day, i.e. the Pih kea sing, or \"Book of Surnames,\" which has been preserved by being reprinted in the King chuen pae peen, a work in 120 books, published in 1581, consisting of extracts from other works on every class of subjects. The eighty-first book is occupied exclusively with the reprint of the Pih kea sing; but so unmercifully mutilated are the characters, that without the Chinese key, it would have been an utter impossibility to have deciphered them. These facts then leave little doubt that this character was used to a considerable extent in China, till near the end of the Yuen dynasty.\n\nIn 1838, H. Conon von Gabelentz published the first specimen in Europe, of the actual employment of the character. This was an inscription in the Mongolian language, which he had extracted from a reprint of the Shih mih tseuen hwa, a Chinese work on lapidary inscriptions, first published in 1618.\n\nA silver plate with a gilt inscription in this same character, was found in 1846, in the district of Minusinsk and govern-\n\n---\n\n1 M\u00e9moires relatifs \u00e0 l'Asie, tome ii.\n2 Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol. ii. p. 1, etc.\nment of Jenissei, in Eastern Siberia. This was deposited in the Asiatic Museum of the Academy of Sciences at Petersburg; and gave rise to a protracted controversy in various periodicals between Messrs. Habakkuk, Grigorief, Hyacinth, Schmidt, Schott, and Banzarof. Mr. Grigorief published a facsimile and an essay on the subject, in the Journal of the Administration of the Interior.\\(^1\\)\n\nAn edict in honour of Confucius published by the emperor Woo-tsong on his accession in 1307, was engraved in the Chinese language, and in the Chinese and Bashpah Mongol characters. An impression of the same is preserved in the Asiatic Museum at Petersburg, and a copy of it was given by Father Hyacinth in his work on the statistics of the Chinese empire.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn 1853, another silver plate, with an inscription similar to the preceding, was discovered at Verchni Udinsk, to the east of Lake Baikal; and is now preserved in the Hermitage Palace in Petersburg. An account of this was given by Mr. Sav\u00e9lief in the fifth volume of the Transactions of the Archaeological Society at Petersburg.\\(^3\\) These plates seem to have been signets given to military envoys, and those holding imperial commissions.\n\nIn an article on Sanscrit and Mongolian characters by Mr. Edkins, published in 1855,\\(^4\\) he has given a facsimile reproduction of the Pih kea sing, from the King chuen pae peen.\n\nWithout knowing anything of what had been done by Von Gabelentz and the Russian orientalists, I chanced one day during the occupation of Shanghae city by the Triad rebels in 1854, to notice in the Confucian temple, an inscription in this character,\\(^5\\) which proved to be a transcript\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal Asiatique, 5e serie, pp. 527-558.\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. p. 526.\n\\(^3\\) Ibid. pp. 527-558.\n\\(^4\\) Transactions of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, part v. pp. 101-108 and 5 plates.\n\\(^5\\) The Confucian temple was afterwards burnt down, and this slab was broken and otherwise injured by the fire. When Shanghae was retaken by the imperialists, the temple was rebuilt in another part of the city, and most of the old tablets found a place in the\nof an edict by Kubla khan, the Chinese original of which was engraved below it. At some risk and trouble I procured a few impressions from this stone, and sent one of them, through Sir John Bowring, to the Royal Asiatic Society in London, where it still remains. A short article on the subject, by myself, appeared in the \"Transactions of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\"\u00b9 for 1855, giving a copy of the inscription in the Mongol and Chinese characters, and also cuts of several coins of the Yuen dynasty.\u00b2 There is also a restoration of the commencement of the Pih kea sing noticed above.\n\nIn 1860, M. Pauthier gave a French translation of the inscription which I had published in the Hongkong Transactions. This appeared in the Journal Asiatique,\u00b3 together with some interesting details on the B\u00e2shpah alphabet.\n\nThe same year a very neat fount of type for this character was cast at the Imprimerie Imp\u00e9riale at Paris, under the instructions of M. Pauthier.\n\nAn article which I had written on the Mongolian inscrip-\n\nnew erection. This place was afterwards used as a lodging for the British officers during the military occupation of that city; and in their little arrangements to make things comfortable, all the inscribed tablets in the walls had been covered with plaster and whitewash. The Mongolian slab I could never find again, and on a visit to the place in company with Dr. Lamprey, he told me he had seen the stone in question used as a block for chopping on.\n\n\u00b9 Part v. pp. 65-81.\n\u00b2 I may be allowed here to notice some confusion that has taken place in the printing of that article. The cut of the coin to note || on page 55 is erroneously placed as note * on page 58. The note marked || at the foot of page 55 should be referred to the word Pih, in the third line of page 56. The Mongol letter p, placed on its side, thus ||, on page 64, should be ||. The four Mongol characters at the top of page 65 are upside down. Engravings of some of these coins may be seen in an article by C. B. Hillier, on \"Chinese Coinage,\" in the Transactions of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, part ii., 1848-50, pp. 105-110; also in the works of De Chandoir, Endlicher, and others, on Chinese numismatics. A special article by Pauthier, on one of these coins, appeared in the Journal Asiatique, 5ma. serie, tom. xv. pp. 321-337, 1860.\n\u00b3 Vol. xix. pp. 5-47.\ntion, translated and published by Von Gabelentz, in the \"Zeitschrift,\" was translated into French by M. Pauthier, and appeared in the Journal Asiatique for 1862.\\(^1\\)\n\nBoth this inscription and the edict of Kubla were reproduced with the new type, in the Appendix to Pauthier's splendid edition of Marco Polo.\n\nThe vertical portion to the right of the Mongol is in the Ouigour character, consisting of twenty lines in a large type and twelve in a smaller. The large character part corresponds almost literally throughout with the Sanscrit. There is no initial invocation, and the doxology at the end of the dh\u0101rani is a transcript of the Sanscrit, with one slight deviation.\n\nThe Ouigour branch of the Turkish race seem to have been in close proximity and intercourse with the Mongols during the Yuen dynasty. They are reported to have been in possession of an alphabet and literature from an unknown antiquity; and scholars are divided in their opinions as to the origin of their written character. The Syriac,\\(^2\\) the Sab\u00e6an,\\(^3\\) and the Zend,\\(^4\\) have each been proposed as the most probable source whence derived. The earliest mention of Ouigour literature is to be found in the Chinese records, about the middle of the fifth century, at which time we are informed, that they possessed in their language Maou's \"Book of Odes,\" the \"Confucian Analects,\" and the \"Book of Filial piety,\" besides some Poets and Historians.\\(^5\\)\n\nIn giving an analysis of a catalogue of Buddhist works, published in China in 1306, Professor Julien makes the following interesting remarks, bearing on Ouigour literature:\n\n\"The last preface dated in 1306, gives the names of twenty-nine savans versed in the Tibetan, Ouigour, Sanscrit, and Chinese languages, who were charged, as appears by the\n\n\\(^1\\) Vol. xix. pp. 461-471.\n\\(^2\\) Remusat, Recherches sur les langues Tartares, p. 29, passim.\n\\(^3\\) Klaproth, Abhandlung \u00fcber die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren, p. 53.\n\\(^4\\) Davids, Grammaire Turke, p. xvi.\n\\(^5\\) Remusat, Recherches, etc. p. 284.\npreface of 1289, to compare the texts with each other, to collate the translations, and to revise and fix them definitively for the general reimpression. Their work, begun in 1285, was finished in 1287. Among these savans, we observe a Buddhist priest from Tourfan, versed in the knowledge of every branch of the sacred literature, who was charged by imperial order to verify the Indian words, and an academician, named To-in-tou-tong, who was commissioned to translate the Ouigour words. An extremely curious fact, unknown hitherto, seems to result from the last-named fact, that is, that the greater part of the Buddhist books must have been translated into Ouigour for the use of the subjects of the Chinese empire who spoke that language. This conjecture is fully justified by the following testimony. I read in the history of celebrated Buddhists, published under the Sung in 988, a passage which shows that anciently the Buddhist books were translated, not only in Tibetan and in Chinese, but also in the languages of people now under submission to the Chinese, and whom the latter treated as barbarians:\u2014\u2018When the Sutras and works on discipline from India were taken to Koutch\u00e9, on the north of the Tsung-ling mountains, to L\u00e8ou-lan, to Kharachar, to Khotan, and to Khashgar, the natives not understanding the language of India, the books were translated for them into the barbarian languages which they spoke.\u2019 Now several of the above-named countries, which at present form part of Bucharia, were previously occupied by Ouigour tribes, at the epoch when our catalogue was published. Scarcely more than two or three Ouigour manuscripts are known in the great libraries of Europe; should there exist then at Peking any considerable portion of the Buddhist books in this ancient dialect of oriental Turkish, so precious for philology, and so little known, it would be an object of the highest interest, to purchase them there at any price, and to place them within the reach of scholars.\u201d\n\nOf the very few specimens of the ancient language and\n\n---\n\n1 M\u00e9langes de G\u00e9ographie Asiatique, pp. 223, 224.\nliterature of the Ouigours known in Europe, the oldest of the manuscripts does not date earlier than the 10th century.\\(^1\\)\n\nWhen the Mongols under Genghis khan began to attain their immense power, they were a comparatively unpolished people, and possessed no literature of their own. On the defeat of the Naimans by that nation, Tatatonggo, the secretary of the Naiman prince, a Ouigour by birth, was made prisoner; but was instated by Genghis as Professor of the Ouigour language and literature, for the benefit of his subjects, the princes and nobles of the Mongol nation.\\(^2\\) Being thus initiated into the literature of the Ouigours, as a matter of necessity the Mongols had naturally fallen into the habit of using the same character for the purpose of committing their own language to writing; and this practice continued to prevail during the supremacy of Ogdai, Guyu, and Manggu, the three successors of Genghis khan. Ruysbruk, who went on an embassy to the Mongolian court, from France, in 1253, speaking of the Ouigour characters, says:\u2014\u201cMangu khan has sent to your Majesty (St. Louis) letters written in the Mongol or Tartar language, but in Ouigour characters.\u201d\\(^3\\)\n\nWhen the dynasty took possession of China, under the succeeding monarch, Kubla, and the exigencies of a fixed government were more urgent, the inadequacy of the Ouigour character fully to express the articulations and vocables of the Mongol language were felt to be a source of embarrassment. As, it would seem, no man among the Mongols was found to possess sufficient philological tact and inventive skill to remedy this inconvenience, the venerable Tibetan lama Saadja Bandida, under special invitation, took up his residence at the court of Kubla, and applied himself to the task of so modifying the Ouigour character as to adapt it to the requirements of the Mongol. In his scheme, he had retained the fourteen Ouigour consonants, but he died while engaged on the work, leaving it still incomplete. The result was, the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Davids, Grammaire Turke, p. xviii.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. p. xviii.

Although the latter was promulgated in 1269, as the official character of the dynasty, yet, in 1272, we find a memorial to the throne complaining that the officials persist in writing their documents in the Ouigour character. An edict followed thereupon, condemning the practice, and insisting upon the adoption of B\u00e2shpah\u2019s character. In 1278 the use of the Ouigour character on the military signets was forbidden. In 1284, an imperial decree forbade the use of the Ouigour character in all memorials and documents presented by the metropolitan functionaries.\n\nAbout the beginning of the 14th century, Eldja\u00eftu, the successor of Kubla, commissioned the priest Tsordji Osir to translate the Tibetan sacred books into the Mongolian language, and write them out in the B\u00e2shpah character. The lama, however, failed in the attempt; and in order to supersede the difficulty, he reverted to the unfinished work of Saadja Bandida, made such additions as were needful for his purpose, and wrote out with it a Mongol translation of the Tibetan work Bangcha Raktcha, but found it necessary to express a great many words in Tibetan characters.\n\nUnder the direction of Kaisun-killik, the succeeding Emperor, who reigned from 1307 to 1311, Tsordji Osir made such further additions as were needful for adapting the Ouigour alphabet to the perfect transcription of the sounds of the Mongol language. These details, drawn mostly from Klapproth\u2019s \u201cAbhandlung \u00fcber die Sprache und Schrift der Uiguren,\u201d are found in the Chinese history of the Yuen dynasty, and also in a Mongol work, Brulba Saagdja Bandida yin gargaksan Mongol Usuk, \u201cThe Mongol literature invented by the holy Saagdja Bandida,\u201d published in China in 1730.\u00b9\n\nAhmed Ibn Arabsch\u00e2h, an Arabian author, who wrote about 1440, gives a short notice of the Ouigour alphabet, in which he says:\u2014\u201cThe Djaghat\u00e2iens have a writing which they call Ouigour, and which may be recognized as the same\n\n\u00b9 See Remusat\u2019s Recherches, etc. p. 154. Pallas, Sammlungen, etc. vol. ii. p. 356. Klapproth, Abhandlung, etc. p. 57.\nas that of the Mongols; it is composed of fourteen consonants, which have the forms following.\"\u00b9 Here he inserts a copy of the Ouigour alphabet.\n\nThe work above named, Brulba, etc., also gives a table of the fourteen consonants of the Ouigours, combined respectively with the three vowels \\(a\\), \\(\u00e2\\), and \\(i\\), as used by the Mongols previous to the improvement of the lamas.\u00b2 It is doubtful, however, if this be altogether trustworthy; for we find nothing in it to represent the vowel \\(o\\), a letter which is of constant occurrence in the specimens of Ouigour literature preserved in Europe. Were it not so, I should have been disposed to think that in the present transcription we had a specimen of the writing in a transition stage; but from the close resemblance which it bears to the caligraphy of the two Mongolian letters discovered by Remusat in the archives of France, I have no doubt that it is a pure specimen of the character as used by the Ouigours. These two letters,\u2014addressed to Philip the Fair of France, the first by Argun, the Mongol prince of Persia, in 1289; and the second by Eldjaitu, his successor, in 1305;\u2014were thought by Remusat to be in the original Ouigour character, though the documents are in the Mongol language.\u00b3\n\nIn 1845, a silver plate similar to the signets bearing the B\u00e2shpah superscriptions noticed above, but having the superscription in the Ouigour character, was found at Grouchovka, on the Dnieper, in the government of Ekat\u00e9riinoslaf, in Southern Russia. A report on this plate was made to the Academy of Sciences at Petersburg, in 1848, by Mr. Banzarof, which was published in their \"Bulletin historico-philologique,\"\u2074 with a facsimile engraving; from which we see that the writing is almost identical with that on the in-\n\n\u00b9 Langl\u00e8s, in Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits de la Biblioth\u00e8que Royale, tom. v.

As we know that the use of the Ouigour character on these signets was prohibited in 1278, it must have been made previous to that date.\n\nThe portion to the right of the Ouigour is in the Neuchih character, consisting of twenty-seven lines of large size and twenty-one lines of a smaller type. The large character portion is almost a counterpart of the Sanscrit, down to about the middle of the twenty-fifth line, where the dh\u00e1rani concludes. It commences with the invocation Om bh\u00fbr om sv\u00e1h\u00e1, the same as the Chinese and others, and the portion following the dh\u00e1rani is evidently a doxology, though I have only succeeded in identifying a small portion of it.\n\nAlthough the name of this writing is not unknown to orientalists, yet beyond the name very few facts have been gathered; and this inscription I believe to be unique, not only as giving a correct specimen of the caligraphy, but as being the only piece yet discovered, in which there is any clue to the powers of the characters.\n\nThe Neuchih Tartars succeeded the Tsitans as the dominant power in the north of China, in the early part of the 12th century, under the name of the Kin dynasty. Originally a rude unlettered tribe, they were dependent upon the Chinese and Tsitans for their correspondence and literary negotiations; but they learned to rise with their position, and it was not long ere they began to feel the inconvenience of transacting their diplomacy through interpreters in an alien language. Impressed no doubt with the importance of possessing a national literature, the preliminary necessity of a written character capable of expressing the sounds of their language became apparent. They saw that their predecessors and vanquished rivals, the Tsitans, had been placed at a similar disadvantage at the beginning of their rule, and had invented a character which had been the national writing of the Leaou dynasty for about two hundred years.\u00b9 Following their precedent, Akuta, the founder of the Kin, resolved upon\n\n\u00b9 I only know of the existence of one inscription in this character, and as there is no translation of it in Chinese or any other language,\nhaving special resources for reducing to writing the language of his tribe; and having among his captives many subjects of the Chinese and also of the Leaou, a special study was made of the literature of these two nations. The result was that an imperial commission, consisting of Ouy\u00e9, Moulianho, and Kuhshin, was appointed to form a new set of symbols, from the elements of the Chinese pattern-hand characters, on the same principle as those of the Tsitan, but adapted to the sounds of their national language.\\(^1\\) In a few months the characters were formed, and an imperial decree issued in the eighth month of the year 1119, ordered their general adoption.\\(^2\\) In 1138, He-tsung, the third emperor, originated a new set of characters for the Neuchih language, and these were named Small Neuchih characters; while those which Kuhshin and his colleagues had invented were termed the Large Neuchih characters.\\(^3\\) The Small characters were brought into use officially, in the fifth month of the year 1145.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe Vandalism attendant on the overthrow of dynasties in China, has been especially destructive to the literary productions of the conquered party, and it is scarcely to be expected that many traces of the literary ingenuity of the Neuchihs would survive their subjection to another race. A note to the Suh wan heen t'ung k'aou tells us that the Chinese Classics and Histories were translated in this character; and a catalogue of the imperial library during the Ming\\(^5\\) gives it remains at present a dead letter. The following five characters are preserved with their interpretation in the Chinese \"Topography of Ching-tih prefecture.\" \u5e1d I (as used by the emperor); \u9a6c An imperial order; \u652f To run; \u9a6c Horse; \u6025 Urgent. The history of the Leaou dynasty speaks of an edict having been engraved on stone, in the characters of the Tsitans, Turks, and Chinese, but I am not aware if that inscription is still extant.\n\n\\(^1\\) Suh wan heen t'ung k'aou, book 184, p. 31.

Whether any of these are still in existence is I think at least doubtful, but M. Rosny expresses a more hopeful view of the case.\\(^1\\)\n\nThat the language and literature of the Neuchihs did not at once disappear with the extinction of the dynasty we have evidence, for in 1407, when a translatorial institution was established by the Ming, for the purpose of facilitating correspondence with foreign nations, one of the languages to which special attention was directed was the Neuchih. The students were examined periodically, and the most efficient appointed to offices in connection with the embassies. In 1470 seven interpreters were officially designated for the Neuchih language, and the number was afterwards increased to nine. The translatorial office was re-established on the accession of the present dynasty in 1644, with a president and corps of fifty-six professors. Long before this, however, it is probable that the cumbrous Neuchih character had become obsolete, for in the accounts we have of the invention or rather adaptation of the present Manchu character, there is no hint of any kind of writing in existence peculiar to the tribe. The Manchus being the actual descendants of the Kin dynasty Neuchihs, there would scarcely be a distinct language, and we consequently find the Neuchih department of the translators\u2019 office suppressed in 1659, and the ancient Neuchih character entirely superseded by the modern Manchu.\n\nRemusat, in his \u201cRecherches sur les langues Tartares,\u201d has written at greater length on this subject than any other European author, having collected together what few notices he could find in Chinese works; but having never seen a\n\n\\(^1\\) He says: \u201cWhen the friends of science shall have undertaken scientific journeys, for the purpose of exploring the great public and private libraries of China, libraries whose number is immense, and the preservation of which has been the object of the greatest care and attention, we shall doubtless find the greater part of the literary monuments for which we are now anxious, and a number of others, which will prove so many revelations in the midst of this old Chinese world, whose destiny on earth may probably have been to preserve to us vestiges of primitive and forgotten ages in the history of the globe.\u201d\u2014Revue Orientale et Am\u00e9ricaine, 1\\(^{e}\\) s\u00e9rie, tom. vi. pp. 386, 387.\nspecimen of the Neuchih writing, he was induced by the descriptions to believe that the character now used by the Coreans was identical with that of the Kin dynasty. This hypothesis at least we are now in a position to meet with a direct negative. An inscription in an unknown character, at the Imperial Mausoleum at Keen-chow, in the Province of Shense, has been preserved to us in a Chinese work published in 1618, the \u77f3\u58a8\u942b\u83ef Shih mih tseuen hwa.\u00b9 From a Chinese translation and note given on the tablet, we learn that this is an inscription in the Neuchih or national character of the Kin dynasty. The date given is 1134, from which we see that it was cut previous to the invention of the Small Neuchih character; so that there is no doubt we have there a specimen of the Large Neuchih character, invented by Kuhshin and his colleagues.\n\nA facsimile of this inscription from the Che p\u00fch ts\u00fch chae ts'ung shoo, was published by Professor Neumann in 1837, in regard to which he remarks:\u2014\"I am not able to read the Kin writing, much less to translate it; but it is obvious from the frequent repetitions of characters in the text of our memorial that this Kin writing consists of a syllabary composed of abbreviated and modified Chinese characters.\"\u00b2\n\nShortly after this the same inscription seems to have attracted the attention of the Archimandrite Habakkuk, while he was residing at Peking, and he communicated it to Father Hyacinth at Petersburg in 1841. The latter gave a facsimile of the same in his work on the statistics of China.\u00b3\n\nI was not aware of this inscription having been noticed or\n\n\u00b9 This work was reprinted during the present dynasty, in a collection entitled \u85dd\u5703\u641c\u5947 Epoo sow ke. It was also reprinted in a reduced form in the \u77e5\u4e0d\u8db3\u9f4b\u53e2\u66f8 Che p\u00fch ts\u00fch chae ts'ung shoo, published in the 18th century. The same inscription is reproduced in the \u91d1\u77f3\u8403\u7de8 Kin shih ts\u00fay p\u00e9en, published in 1805. It is noticed in several other works on lapidary inscriptions.\n\n\u00b2 Asiatische studien, p. 41.\n\n\u00b3 See Journal Asiatique, 5e s\u00e9rie, tom. 17, p. 532.\npublished by any one in Europe, when it occurred to me to collect what information I could regarding the system of writing used by the Neuchihhs; and the inscription in question, which I found in the Shih mih tseuen hwa, being the only specimen of the character that I could discover, I forwarded a facsimile, with some remarks, to the Asiatic Society in 1859. The same appeared in the Society's Journal the following year.\u00b9\n\nIn 1861, Professor De Rosny, of Paris, published an article on \"The Neuchihh, their language and literature,\"\u00b2 by which it appears he has misunderstood my remarks; but he expresses, with considerable confidence, his belief that the writing is ideographic and not alphabetic. Although my opinion was decidedly in favour of the Neuchihh being an alphabetic or syllabic writing, I find, on referring to my former article, that I scarcely expressed such a view, preferring to leave the question to be decided when we should acquire more light on the subject. It was something novel to me to find M. de Rosny advocating the ideographic as the most probable, to the exclusion of the alphabetic, and I regret that he has not given us a fuller development of his reasons, for, from his extensive knowledge of the written characters of various nations, probably few are in a more favourable position to form a correct appreciation of the matter.\n\nIf my tendency was formerly towards the alphabetic theory, my views are now so far modified by the analysis of the newly-found inscription, that I incline to the view at first expressed by Professor Neumann, that the Kin was a syllabic writing.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. 17, pp. 331 passim.\n\u00b2 \"Revue Orientale et Am\u00e9ricaine,\" 1re s\u00e9rie, tome 6, pp. 379\u2013387.\n\u00b3 The accompanying cut, taken from a Chinese brochure on coins, which has merely the title \u5916\u570b\u9322\u6587 Wae ki\u010d\u00f6 tseen wan, \"Superscriptions of foreign money,\" is termed a \"Sanscrit character coin;\" but as the character bears no resemblance to any known form of Sanscrit writing, and as it presents a strong similarity to that on the Keen-chow tablet, I am induced to think it is\nHaving ascertained, then, with tolerable certainty that the preceding inscription is a specimen of the Large Neuchih character; and being assured that the one with which we are now occupied is also Neuchih\u2014observing the radical difference in the formation of the characters; we are shut up to the conclusion that this is a specimen of the Small Neuchih character, invented in 1138. The date is more than two centuries later, being 1345.\n\nThanks to the transcripts in the other characters, and especially the Sanscrit, there are scarcely any of the Neuchih in the larger size part to which I cannot attach the sounds with a high degree of probability, if not absolute certainty. The conclusion at which I have arrived is given in the plate facing this page.\n\nThe last character in the list \u9f8d to which I have not put any sound, is one of very frequent occurrence, being found 39 times; that is, it is distinctly legible 33 times, and in six other places I have supplied it, as I think, on unquestionable authority. It is to be noticed that in every case this is written smaller than the other characters; a peculiarity which belongs only to two or three others in certain places, and appears to me to indicate that the sign so written plays a secondary part in the syllable. Another peculiarity which attaches to \u9f8d is, that while every other Neuchih sign is represented by a corresponding one in Chinese, there is in no case any counterpart to this in Chinese. Of the 39 places where it is found, 30 times it stands against the long vowel \u00e1; i.e. in \u00e1, 2; b\u00e1, 1; d\u00e1, 1; ddh\u00e1, 1; h\u00e1, 7 (3 of which I have supplied); k\u00e1, 1; m\u00e1, 2; n\u00e1, 3 (one of which I have\n\na relic of the Kin. The paucity of documents in that character may warrant its insertion here. The explanatory note says:\u2014\"This Sanscrit character coin is eight-tenths of an inch diameter, and weighs 3 choo (\u9296) 6 ts\u2019an (\u53c3). It is copper, of a pure red colour.

Seven times it is found appended where there is no long vowel in the Sanscrit, of which four of the syllables end in a; i.e. na, 1; ra, 1; ta, 1; ya, 1;\u00b9 one ends in e; i.e. ddhe; and two end in i, i.e. ddhi, 1; and ti, 1 (which I have supplied).\n\nFrom the preceding analysis of 39 occurrences of this character, I am disposed to think that it is a sign indicating the lengthening of the vowel in the syllable to which it is attached, and that the seven (or perhaps six) exceptions are irregularities.\n\nSuch is the result of the inscription on the east side of the arch, and the decipherment of the west side would probably add a few more to the number of the identified vocables. From an examination of these 81 characters, I am convinced that the Neuchih writing was pre-eminently syllabic, and not alphabetic, as I inferred on a former occasion. The selection of symbols appears to me to be the most arbitrary, nor can I see any approach to principle or mutual relation in comparing the one with the other. Not only do we find the utmost diversity in the forms of any series of syllables we may select, classified either according to their initials or finals, or any other principle that I can think of; but there are also characters nearly similar in form, which express widely different sounds.\n\nThus the characters \u975e va and \u975e wa, although nearly allied phonetically, are yet totally unlike in every part. If there is any difference in sound between \u975e m\u00e2n and \u975e m\u00e2n, it is merely one of tone, as indicated by the Chinese equivalents; and yet their forms would never lead any one to suspect a phonetic connection. So also the two characters for ga \u975e and \u975e, although so utterly dissimilar, yet they represent precisely the same syllable. Again, if we have diversity of forms corresponding to similar sounds, there are also similar forms answering to very different sounds; thus \u975e ki only differs by one stroke from \u975e va.\n\n\u00b9 It is doubtful if this syllable ought not to be y\u00e2.\nIt would seem as if a number of Chinese characters had been selected to represent the sounds in the Neuchih language, on the plan adopted by the Japanese, but abbreviated and disfigured after a fashion of their own, to which we have now no key. While the original or Large Neuchih characters, of which the specimen at Keen-chow has been published, show some traces of the form of Chinese, this latter invention of the Small Neuchih characters appears to be a more elegant and abbreviated form, in which the slight traces retained in the earlier invention are altogether obliterated, and the faintly-pictorial forms of which each character was made up are represented by merely conventional collocations of strokes. Thus we have all the cumbrous variety of a pictorial system adapted to the expression of a simple series of vocables. The scheme is, probably, unique in the history of chirography, and is not a little suggestive in reference to the condition of the people among whom it took its rise. It seems strange that a complex syllabary like this should have been adopted by a people living so near the tribes who were using the simple Ouigour alphabet, and would imply a very restricted intercourse with such tribes. Instead of wondering that such a method of writing should be neglected and become obsolete, we may rather be astonished that it was able to maintain its ground for two centuries and more, as is proved by this inscription.\n\nIt is probable that the eighty-one signs here given are but a small portion of the Neuchih syllabary, as it is not at all likely that the simple sounds of the Sanscrit alphabet would anything like exhaust the vocables of the Neuchih language. Accordingly we find in the twenty-one lines of small characters at the end of the large, a great number of new ones which do not occur in the preceding portion. Now as every several character has to be learned by itself, and the knowledge of any one or more gives no clue to what is the sound of another, here is a study of a much more difficult nature.\n\nI have mentioned that each of the parts except the Sanscrit concludes like this, with some lines in a smaller size character. On looking over the Chinese part, I saw at once that\nthat was not a mere transcript of foreign sounds, but a veritable piece of composition in the Chinese language. Although very much defaced and obliterated, I have been able to get an approximate sense out of the several detached fragments, though the omission of so many links necessarily prevents a perfect translation even of what remains.\n\nHaving shown the Tibetan portion to Professor Foucaux, at Paris, I ascertained from him that that was in the Tibetan language, and not a transliteration from another tongue. From a cursory inspection of that hopelessly imperfect portion, he could give me the meaning of such fragments, that I felt assured, if it was not the exact translation of the Chinese, it was at least the same in substance.\n\nA superficial examination of the Mongol portion satisfied me that that was also in the Mongol language; and the Ouigour portion seems to be in the Ouigour language. Under these circumstances, the presumption is almost a certainty that the small-size Neuchih is a specimen of the Neuchih language as well as writing. This imparts an additional interest to it; and while the difficulty of interpretation is thereby increased, its philological value is greatly enhanced.\n\nAppended is an interlinear restoration of the inscription, and the sounds of the syllables given in Latin characters, according to the Sanscrit. The columns coincide in length and number with the original lines of the Neuchih portion, and the corresponding syllables in each of the six lines are placed horizontally opposite, as near as the peculiarities of the respective systems will admit. The portion in black is what is preserved of the original inscription, and the missing parts which have been supplied are represented by the red.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 A reduced facsimile of the four vertical portions of the inscription, produced by photo-lithography, from the original rubbing, will appear in Col.

Res. III. 217, seq. In it a part of Utpala's commentary also is given in translation. The reading followed by Davis, as appears from his translation, is: \u0928\u0935\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0936 \u0938\u0939\u094b\u0926\u092f\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0935\u093e \u092f\u0947\u0928 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0941\u0930\u092e\u0924\u0940, which is mentioned also in the Var. Lect. to the edited text. The comparison of the MSS. leaves little doubt that this reading is a correction, suggested by the remark of Utpala, that in case the planet should set in one and rise in another Nakshatra, only that name must be taken which agrees with the order of the month. It may happen that the Jovial year is called M\u00e2rga\u00e7\u00eersha, although the planet sets in it, and this does not seem to agree with the author's rule, but only those names of Nakshatras can be used, from which the names of the lunar months are derived; even if Jupiter rises in Rohini, the year cannot be called Rauhi\u00f1a, there being no month of the name. The addition of the word \u092e\u093e\u0938\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093f\u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d implies the rule which is expressed in the reading followed by Davis.

The (first year of each lustrum called) Sa\u1e41vatsara is (ruled by) Agni; the second, Parivatsara, by the Sun; the third, Id\u0101vatsara, by the Moon; the fourth, Anuvatsara, by the Creator; and the last, Udvatsara,\u00b9 by Rudra.\n\n25. In the first year of a lustrum there is indifferent rain; in the second, rain falls only in the beginning of the season (i.e. in \u010cr\u0101vana and Bh\u0101drapada); in the third, rain is very copious; the fourth year brings rain in the later season (i.e. only in \u0100\u1e63vina and K\u0101rttika); the fifth year is said to give very little rain.\n\n26. Amongst these lustrums there are four excellent, viz., those ruled by Vishnu, Indra, Brhaspati, and Agni; the four middlemost are indifferent, and the four last are reputed to be very bad.\n\n27.

Cf. the Var. Lect. It must be added that some MSS. of the Comm. too have \u0909\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0930. Cf. also Weber, Naxatra, 2, 298.\nthe first year of the cycle of sixty, named Prabhava, a year salutary to all beings.\\footnote{Cf. Davis, As. Res. III. p. 220. The word \\textit{an\u00e7a} also means \"degree,\" but is here rendered by \"quarter,\" according to Utpala, who explains it by \\textit{p\u0101da}.}\n\n28. At some places, however, will be drought, and raging of storms and fires; plagues of the country also and phlegmatic diseases are found in the course of this year of Prabhava; yet people will feel no serious grief.\n\n29. The year following is known as Vibhava; the third is \u00c7ukla; after it, Pramoda; and, finally, Praj\u0101pati. These years and their effects are happy in an always increasing degree.\n\n30. Over countries where rice, sugar-cane, barley, and other corn produce good crops, where dangers are past, hostilities stilled, mankind rejoicing, where the miseries of the Iron Age have disappeared, the monarchs then hold their sway.\n\n31. In the second lustrum, the first year is Angiras; the two following \u00c7rimukha and Bh\u0101va; then Yuvan; finally, Dh\u0101tar; these are the five years in due order. Three out of them are excellent; the two remaining middling.\n\n32. In the former three years\\footnote{R. in the printed text, \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941\u0935\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u0941, as the Comm. has.} it rains sufficiently, and people live free from affliction and dread. In the latter two also it rains indifferently well, but diseases prevail and war is impending.\n\n33. In the lustrum presided over by Indra, the first year bears the name of \u012a\u00e7vara; the second, of Bahudh\u00e2nya. The three following years, as measured by the motion of Jupiter, are known as Pram\u0101th\u012bn, Vikrama, and V\u1e5bsha.\\footnote{This word is constantly written \u0935\u093f\u0937 in one MSS. of the Comm. This in addition to the Var. Lect. The word is introduced into Tamil in the form of vi\u015bu.}\n\n34. The first and second are good years, and bring back the Golden Age, as it were, amongst mankind. Evil is Pra-\nm\u00e2thin, but Vikrama and Vrsha bestow copiousness of food, although at the same time they cause dangerous diseases.\n\n35. The first year of the fourth lustrum, which they call Citrabh\u00e2nu, is excellent; the second, named Subh\u00e2nu, is middling; it brings sickness, yet causes no mortality.\\(^1\\)\n\n36. Then follows T\u00e2ra\u1e47a, which gives copious rain; further, P\u00e2rthiva, joyful, with the luxuriant growth of grain. The fifth year, Vyaya, is held to be a happy one: love reigns supreme, and festivities follow one another without interruption.\n\n37. In the lustrum of Tvash\u1e6dar, the first year is termed Sarvajit, the second Sarvadh\u00e2rin; on this follow Virodhin, Vik\u1e5bta, and Khara. Of these the second is auspicious, the others are dangerous.\n\n38. Then (in the lustrum allotted to Ahirbudhnya the years are:) Nandana, Vijaya, Jaya, Manmatha, and Durmukha. The first three in this lustrum are beneficent; Manmatha produces indifferent effects; the last year is very bad.\n\n39. In the seventh lustrum are Hemalamba; farther Vilambin, Vik\u0101rin, and \u00c7arvar\u00ee;\\(^2\\) the fifth Jovian year in the cycle is known by the name of Plava.\n\n40. During the first year there will be a great many plagues in the country and rains accompanied with much wind. In the second year there will be but little corn and not much rain;\\(^3\\) the third will be very rich in terrors and rain; Plava, finally, is beneficent, and gives plenty of rain.\n\n41. In the lustrum ruled by the Vi\u1e63ve-Devas the first year is called \u00c7obhak\u1e5b,\\(^4\\) the second \u00c7ubhak\u1e5b, the third Krodhin; the succeeding are Vi\u1e63v\u0101vasu and Par\u0101bhava.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Comm. follows a wholly different reading. See Var. Lect.\n\n\\(^2\\) The names of the years are as well masculine as neuter, because abda is promiscuously used in both genders. As to \u00c7arvar\u00ee, our text would admit also a stem \u00c7arvarin. Utpala does not analyze \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0923\u0940\u0924\u093f. The Tamil form is \u015b\u0101rvari.\n\n\\(^3\\) \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0932\u093f\u0902 is erroneously printed as if it were a compound.\n\n\\(^4\\) Utpala, according to the testimony of the copyists or correctors of\n42. The first and second bring pleasure to the people; the third many evils; the last two are indifferent, but in Par\u00e2bhava will be fires, distress owing to war and sickness, and danger to Brahmins and kine.\n\n43, 44. The first year in the ninth lustrum is Plavanga, the second Kilaka; farther, Saumya, S\u00e2dh\u00e2ra\u1e47a, and, lastly, Rodhak\u1e5bt. Kilaka and Saumya bestow hail; Plavanga is unfortunate for mankind, in many respects; S\u00e2dh\u00e2ra\u1e47a brings little rain and plagues of the country. As to the fifth year, Rodhak\u1e5bt, the rain in it and the thriving of the crops will be unequally divided.\n\n45. In the tenth lustrum, which is sacred to Indra-Agni, the first year has the name of Paridh\u0101vin. Then comes Pram\u0101din and \u0100nanda; the following are R\u00e2kshasa and Anala.\n\n46. In Paridh\u0101vin, the middle-country is ruined, the king lost, the rain deficient, and fire shows its fury. In Pram\u0101din men are indolent; there will be riots, and loss of red flowers and seeds.\n\n47. The following year makes all men rejoice. Both R\u00e2kshasa and Anala bring damage; the former produces summer corn, the latter excites conflagrations and pestilence.\n\n48. In the eleventh lustrum are Pingala, K\u00e2layukta, Siddh\u00e2rtha, Raudra, and Durmati. During the first year there is excessively much rain, theft, asthma, cough, and shaking of the jaws.\n\n49. K\u00e2layukta has many evils, but in Siddh\u00e2rtha are many good things. Raudra is declared to be very cruel and pernicious. Durmati brings, moderately, rain.\n\n50. In the lustrum lorded over by Bhaga, the first year, called Dundubhi, greatly promotes the growth of the grain.\n\nsome MSS. of his commentary, prefers \u0936\u094b\u0915\u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d, but according to other copyists, \u0936\u094b\u0915\u0939\u0943\u0924\u094d. The Tamil has borrowed this and the following name in the form of \u015bubakiru\u1e6du and \u015bobakiru\u1e6du, consequently in inverse order.\nThe following, termed Udg\u0101rin,\u00b9 is baneful to sovereigns, whilst the rains during it will be unequally distributed.\u00b2\n\n51. The third year is Rakt\u0101ksha, in which there is danger caused by mordacious animals, and sickness. The fourth, Krodha, arouses much wrath, and depopulates kingdoms through wars.\n\n52. The last year of the last lustrum is styled Kshaya. This, the originator of manifold loss, causes danger to Brahmans, though it makes cultivators thrive, and augments the profits of Vai\u1e63yas, C\u016b\u1e0dras, and thieves.\n\nHerewith I have given, in a succinct form, the whole of what is contained in the work, \u201cthe Cycle of Sixty Years.\u201d\n\n53. The planet Jupiter, when bristling with bright rays, showing a large orb and the hue of the white lotus, of jessamine or crystal, whilst moving on the right road,\u00b3 not overpowered by another planet,\u2074 brings weal to mankind.\u2075\n\n---\n\n**Chapter IX.**\n\n*The Course of Venus.*\n\n1.

But (in our opinion) the wild elephant\u2019s path includes Sv\u0101ti, Bharani, and K\u1e5bttik\u0101; the three following paths comprehend each three mansions, beginning with Rohini.\\(^2\\) In the cow\u2019s path lie A\u1e63vin\u012b, Revati, and both Bhadrapad\u0101s; in that of the old ox, \u010crava\u1e47a, Dhanish\u1e6dh\u0101, and Catabhishaj; in that of the deer, Anur\u0101dh\u0101, Jyesh\u1e6dh\u0101, and M\u016bla; Hasta, Vi\u1e63\u0101kh\u0101, and Citr\u0101 make up the goat\u2019s path; the two Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101s form that of fire.\n\n\\(^1\\) This view is held by the authorities Devala and K\u0101\u00e7yapa.

Others say that the paths and roads are north, middle, or south, according as the junction stars of the mansions are in the north, middle, or south of the girdle of asterisms.\n\n6. Some others again define the roads in this way: the northern road commences with Bharan\u00ee (and goes to Magh\u00e2 included); the middle road begins with P\u00fbrva-Phalgun\u00ee; the southern road extends from P\u00fbrva-Ash\u00e2d\u00eeha (to the end of A\u00e7vin\u00ee).\n\n7. (But enough); the science of stars is founded upon tradition, and where the authorities disagree it does not become us to make our own choice either way. My task is to mention the different opinions.\n\n8. The planet Venus setting or rising in the northern paths, produces abundance of food and happiness; in the middle paths, it has indifferent effects; in the southern ones, it has a miserable influence.\n\n9. One may state the effects to be very excellent, excellent, a little less, indifferently good, middling, less than this, bad, miserable, and utterly miserable, in the northern paths, and so on, in succession.\n\n10. The first division (of the cluster of Nakshatras) consists of the four mansions, Bharan\u00ee, Krttik\u00e2, Rohin\u00ee, and Mrga\u00e7iras. It brings abundance, but causes terror in the countries of Vanga, Anga, Mahisha, B\u00e2hlika, and Kalinga.\n\n---\n\nThere is a considerable discrepancy between this passage of Garga\u2019s and the one quoted immediately before. The word \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f in the second stanza means \u201cindifferent, neuter, neither good nor bad.\u201d\n\nThis is a very elliptical way of speaking for \u201cthe planet standing in this division.\u201d\n11. If another planet overtakes\\(^1\\) Venus after the latter has risen in this division, it will destroy the kings of the Bhadr\u0101-\u00e7vas,\\(^2\\) \u00c7\u016brasenas, Yaudheyas, and of Kotivarsha.\n\n12. The second division is made up of \u0100dr\u0101, Punarvasu, Pushya, and A\u00e7lesh\u0101; it brings immense rain and good crops; to Brahmans, especially to such as are cruel-minded, it is disastrous.\n\n13. When Venus is assailed\\(^3\\) in it by another planet, distress presses the barbarians, savages, horsekeepers, possessors of kine, the Gonardas, proletaries, \u00c7\u00fbdras, and Videhas.\n\n14. The planet if rising in Magh\u00e2, P\u00fbrva-Phalgun\u00ee, Uttara-Phalgun\u00ee, Hasta, or Citr\u00e2 (forming the third division), causes the loss of the crops, danger of famine, and robbery, the rise in rank of low-born people, and confusion of the different classes of society.\n\n15. The same being checked\\(^4\\) in Magh\u00e2, etc., by another planet, strikes the shepherds, \u00c7abara-savages, \u00c7\u00fbdras, (barbarous) Pu\u1e47\u1e0dras, the savages of the western marches, the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Utpala: \u0905\u0928\u094d\u092f\u094b \u092f\u0939 \u0906\u0930\u094b\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0941\u092a\u0930\u093f \u092a\u0924\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0964 \u0905\u092f\u0924\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0903\u0964\n\n\\(^2\\) The Bhadr\u0101\u00e7vas are a mythical people, fabled to live in the remote East, or, according to the phrase of the astronomical Siddh\u0101ntas, at 90\u00b0 E. from Lank\u00e2, in the region where Yavako\u1e6di, \u201cJava Point,\u201d is situated. (The r. Yamako\u1e6di is erroneous, for Yama\u2019s kingdom is in the South, not in the East; and, besides, the compound Yamako\u1e6di is devoid of sense.) The origin of the Bhadr\u0101\u00e7vas dwelling near the Udayagiri may be traced, I think, to Rgveda, i. 115, 2, seq.\n\n\\(^3\\) The term \u0101kramate\u2014\u201cjumps up against, assails, attacks, overpowers\u201d\u2014is synonymous with \u0101rohati (v. 11), \u201cjumps upon, overtakes.\u201d\n\n\\(^4\\) Avashtabdha is another synonym to \u0101kr\u0101nta and \u0101rudha.\nS\u00fblikas,\u00b9 the inhabitants of the Vanav\u00e2sin district,\u00b2 the Dravidas and coasters.\u00b3\n\n16. The three mansions, Sv\u00e2ti, Vi\u00e7\u00e2kh\u00e2, and Anur\u00e2dh\u00e2, form the fourth division, which causes no danger, promotes abundance and prosperity amongst the nobility, but, at the same time, dissensions betwixt friends.\n\n17. The planet, when assailed in it, is deadly to the chief-tain of the Kir\u00e2tas, and crushes the Ikshv\u00e2kus, the savage border tribes,\u2074 the Avantis, Pulindas, Tanga\u00f1as, and \u00c7\u00fbrasenas.\n\n18. The five lunar asterisms, Jyeshth\u00e2, M\u00fbla, P\u00fbrva-Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, Uttara-Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, and \u00c7ravana (which makes the fifth division), bring famine, robbers, and sickness, and annoy the Kashmirians, A\u00e7makas, Matsyas, Avantis, and those that dwell along the banks of the C\u00e2rudev\u00ee.\n\n19. In case of Venus being overtaken in this division, the \u00c2bh\u00eeras, Dravidas, Ambashthas, Trigartians, Surashtrians, and Sindhu-Suv\u00eeras are ruined, and the lord of K\u00e2\u00e7i-country will be killed.\n\n20. The sixth division consists of the six Nakshatras, Dhanishth\u00e2, \u00c7atabhishaj, P\u00fbrva-Bhadrapad\u00e2, Uttara-Bhadrapad\u00e2, Revat\u00ee, and A\u00e7vin\u00ee; it is a lucky one, rich in corn, teeming with wealth and flocks of cows, though, here and there, it is not exempt from perils.\n\n21. Should Venus be overtaken in it, then the S\u00fblikas, Gandharians, and Avantis get afflicted, the King of Videha\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 This seems to be the preferable spelling.\n\n\u00b2 Utpala takes \u0935\u0928\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u0928\u0903; here appellative, as \u0935\u0928\u0947\u091a\u0930\u093e\u0903; but this being a general term would include all tribes living in forests, consequently the \u00c7abar\u00e2s too. Cf. ch. xiv. 12; Mah\u00e2bh. ii. 31, 69; Lassen, Ind. Alt. vol. iii. p. 185 and 279.\n\n\u00b3 Thus the scholiast: \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0903 \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0924\u0940\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u0928\u0903. Since \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0903 means maritim\u00ee, the word certainly may denote the coasters, but here we have rather to think of the islanders of the ocean. Cf. Mah\u00e2bh. ii. 31, 66.\n\n\u2074 Utpala: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0917\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u0928\u0903\u0964\nis killed; the forest tribes of the Borders, the Yavanas, Scythians, and servants\\(^1\\) flourish.\n\n22. The fourth and fifth divisions are happy in the west; the third division is so in the east. The remaining have such results as are mentioned above.\\(^2\\)\n\n23. Hesperus, when visible before sunset, bodes unsafety; when visible the whole day, famine and diseases; when seen with the moon at noon, he brings discord between the royal troops and the city.\\(^3\\)\n\n24.

Venus, at reaching Mrga\u00e7iras, is said to be pernicious to essences and grain; by standing in \u00c5dr\u00e2, the planet hurts the Ko\u00e7alas and Kalingas, and gives plenty of rain.\n\n27. When the same stands in Punarvasu, the A\u00e7makas and Vidarbhas suffer great distress; when in Pushya, there is copious rain, and warfare betwixt the hosts of the inhabitants of Fairyland.\\(^2\\)\n\n28. Venus, moving in A\u00e7lesh\u00e2, makes men suffer horribly from serpents. By cleaving the star Magh\u00e2,\\(^3\\) the same is\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This stanza of our author's is cited in the Pancatantra (i. st. 239), and that in a corrupt form.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Vidy\u00e2dharas are more especially the \"wise\" elves of Teutonic mythology; etymologically, the elves, Icel.

Another stanza defines the latitude of the Moon when causing the occultation of certain stars:\n\n\u0935\u093f\u0935\u093f\u092a\u093f - \u0928\u094d\u092f\u094c \u0938\u0940\u092e\u0947 \u0924\u0943\u0924\u0940\u092f\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0902 \u092d\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0924\u093f \u092a\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0903\u0964\n\u0907\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u092d\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u092a\u094c\u0927\u0902 \u0935\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0923\u092e\u0935\u093f\u091a\u093f\u0938\u0903\u0965\nmischievous to the great treasurers (alias, prime ministers), but bestows much rain.\n\n29. In P\u00fbrva-Phalgun\u00ee the planet annihilates the savage \u00c7abaras and Pulindas, and promotes the fall of rain; in Uttara-Phalgun\u00ee it brings rain and strikes the inhabitants of Kuru-field and Panc\u00e2la.\n\n30, 31. By Venus standing in Hasta, the Kurus and painters suffer, and the rain is prevented from falling; in Citr\u00e2, affliction comes to diggers of wells and to birds, but there will be a fine rain; in Sv\u00e2ti the rain will be plentiful, and distress reigns amongst messengers, merchants, and skippers; in Vi\u00e7\u00e2kh\u00e2 also the planet gives nice rain, though merchants, to be sure, incur peril.\n\n32. The planet, when in Anur\u00e2dh\u00e2, occasions strife between the potentates; in Jyeshth\u00e2, grief to great monarchs; in M\u00fbla, to druggists and physicians; in all three there is drought.\n\n33. In P\u00fbrva-Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, aquatic animals are vexed; in Uttara-Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, diseases rage; in \u00c7rava\u00f1a, sickness of the ear prevails; in Dhanishth\u00e2, danger awaits the infidels.\\(^1\\)\n\n34. In \u00c7atabhishaj, Hesperus afflicts distillers; in P\u00fbrva-Bhadrapad\u00e2, gamblers from profession, as well as the Kuru-Panc\u00e2las; at the same time he brings rain.\n\n35. The same, when in Uttara-Bhadrapad\u00e2,\\(^2\\) damages fruits and roots, and, when in Revat\u00ee, such kings as are to undertake a campaign; when in A\u00e7vin\u00ee, horse-keepers; and, in Bhara\u00f1\u00ee, the Kir\u00e2tas and Yavanas.\\(^3\\)\n\n\"The Moon occults the third star of Magh\u00e2 when she has her greatest latitude north; so she does Pushya, Revat\u00ee, and \u00c7atabhishaj, when she has no latitude.\" From this we must conclude that the third star of the mansion Magh\u00e2 is \\(7\\) Leonis.\n\n\\(^1\\) To understand the quibble, we must bear in mind that another name of Dhanishth\u00e2 is \u00c7ravishth\u00e2, and that Bauddhas are \u00c7r\u00e2vakas. Cf. ch. viii. 12.\n\n\\(^2\\) In the printed text \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0966 is an erratum for \u091a\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0966.\n\n\\(^3\\) We see that not only in the R\u00e2m\u00e2yana the word Yavana is quibbled upon by being connected with \u092f\u094b\u0928\u093f, for \u092d\u0930\u0938\u0940 is synonymous with, or\n36. When Venus becomes visible, or sets on the 14th, 15th, or 8th of the dark half of the month, then the earth resembles one sea of water.\n\n37. When Venus and Jupiter stand, one in the west, the other in the east, in the seventh asterism (alias, at six signs distance) from each other,\u00b9 then the people, oppressed with sickness, unsafety, and grief, look in vain for rain from the Rain-god.\n\n38. When Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn move, all of them, before Venus, then arise conflicts among men, dragons, and the inhabitants of Fairyland, and storms causing the downfall of all that is high.\n\n39. Friends will be fickle in their friendship; Brahmans do not duly attend to their work; and not the slightest rain is granted by the Thunderer, who, with his thunderbolt, cleaves the tops of the mountains.\n\n40. At Saturn advancing before Venus, the barbarians, cats, elephants, asses, buffalos, dark sorts of grain, hogs, Pulinda-savages, \u00c7\u00fbdras and inhabitants of the Dekkhan, perish by the outbreak of ophthalmia and rheumatic diseases.\n\n41. Venus preceding Saturn, destroys the people by fire, the sword, famine, drought, and robbers, and hurts movable and immovable things in this world, and the northern country, and the space around by fire, lightning, and dust.\n\n42. The same staying behind Jupiter, ruins everything white, Brahmans, cows, temples, and the East; the clouds pour showers of hailstones; diseases of the throat prevail; but the autumnal corn will be plentiful.\n\n43. Mercury standing before Venus, at rising or setting, brings rain, and occasions different kinds of jaundice of\n\nat least figured by, \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093f. That \u092d\u0930\u0923\u0940 once must have been a common word for womb may be safely inferred from the fact that \u092d\u0930\u0923\u0940 really occurs as partus, gestatio, Rgveda, x. 31, 6.\n\n\u00b9 The author \u201cintimates herewith,\u201d says Utpala, \u201cthat one of them must be on the eastern, the other on the western horizon\u201d\u2014\u0924\u0947\u0928\u0948\u0924\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u092a\u092f\u0924\u093f \u091a\u092f\u094b\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u092f \u090f\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u092f\u094b\u0917 \u0907\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0928\u093e\u092e\u0927\u093e\u0964\nbilious origin,\\(^1\\) promotes the growth of summer corn, is deadly to monks, keepers of sacrificial fire, physicians, stage performers, horses, Vai\u00e7yas, cows, kings along with their vehicles, to yellow things, and the West.\n\n44. When Hesperus is red, like fire, there is danger of fire; when blood-red, the sword will rage; when pale, like a gold line on a touchstone, diseases reign; when greenish yellow or russet, asthma and cough rage; when ashy, coarse, or dusty in appearance, no water falls from heaven.\n\n45. But when the brightest of planets shows the hue of curdled milk, the white water-lily, or the moon, has distinct and far expanding rays, and a large orb, occupies a favourable position amid the stars, is free from unnatural signs and victorious,\\(^2\\) then it brings about a state of things similar to that in the Golden Age.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter X.**\n\n*Saturn's Course.*\n\n1. In staying in \u00c7rava\u1e47a, Sv\u0101ti, Hasta, \u0100rdr\u0101, Bharan\u00ee, and P\u016brva-Phalgun\u00ee, Saturn, if bright, makes the earth to be covered with plenty of water.\n\n2. The same, standing in A\u00e7lesh\u00e2, \u00c7atabhishaj, and Jye\u1e63\u1e6dh\u00e2, brings safety, but no abundant rain; in M\u00fbla, he brings famine, the sword, and drought. I will also state the effects (of Saturn) in each mansion separately.\n\n3. By moving in A\u00e7vin\u00ee, Saturn destroys horses, grooms, poets, physicians, and kings' counsellors; by moving in Bharan\u00ee, dancers, musicians, singers, outcasts, and reprobates.\n\n4.

The Vatsas, sacrificers, their employers, noblemen, and the inhabitants of the Middle-country suffer, when Saturn is moving in Mrga\u00e7iras; likewise the P\u00e2ratas, R\u00e2ma\u00f1has, oil-millers, bleachers, and thieves, during the planet\u2019s stay in \u00c2dr\u00e2; so do the Panjabees, the inhabitants of the Western Marches, Surashtrians and Sindhu-Sauv\u00edras, when Saturn stands in Punarvasu; and when in Pushya, bell-ringers, public criers, Yavanas, merchants, gamblers, and flowers.\n\n7, 8. The planet\u2019s motion in A\u00e7lesh\u00e2 causes affliction to aquatic animals or products, and snakes; in Magh\u00e2, to the B\u00e2hlikas, Chinese, Gandharians, S\u00fblikas, P\u00e2ratas, Vai\u00e7yas, to storehouses and merchants; in P\u00fbrva-Phalgun\u00ee, to vendors of liquors, women of the town, damsels, and the Mahrattees; in Uttara-Phalgun\u00ee, to kings, sugar, salt, mendicant friars, water, and the district of Taksha\u00e7il\u00e2.\n\n9. By the planet standing in Hasta, barbers, potters (or oil-millers), thieves, physicians, tailors, elephant catchers, harlots, the Kausalakas, and makers of garlands are afflicted.\n\n10. When Saturn is staying in Citr\u00e2, the same occurs to women, writers, painters, and variegated vessels; when in Sv\u00e2ti, to bards, spies, envoys, equerries, shippers, mimics, and such-like people.\n\n11. By the planet\u2019s stay in Vi\u00e7\u00e2kh\u00e2, the Trigartians, Chinese, Kul\u00fbtas, saffron, lac, corn, madder, and safflower are lost.\n\n12. When the planet stands in Anur\u00e2dh\u00e2, the Kul\u00fbtas, Tanganas, Kashmirians, along with kings\u2019 counsellors, magicians, and bell-ringers, come to grief, and discord arises between friends.\n\n---\n\n1 Utpala differently: \u0930\u0938\u0903 \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e\u0927\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0915\u091f\u0941\u0924\u093f\u0915\u092a\u093e\u092f\u0903\u0964\n\u090f\u0937\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0964\n\n2 Utpala: \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092d\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0923\u093f\u0964 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093e\u0928\u0940\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u0903\u0964\n\n3 \u0938\u0942\u0924\u093e: are, according to the Comm., \u0938\u093e\u0930\u0925\u094d\u092f\u0903 \u0915\u0925\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0915\u093e \u0935\u093e; they combine, however, both qualifications.\n\n4 Otherwise the Comm. \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u091a\u0930\u0903 \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0915\u093e\u0930\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0903\u0964\n13. Kings, priests, men honoured by kings, heroes, associations, families, and guilds come to grief by Saturn standing in Jyesht\u0101; so do the K\u0101cis, Kosalas, Panc\u0101las, fruits, herbs, and soldiers, by his stay in M\u016bla.\n\n14. When the planet is moving in P\u016brva-Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, the Angas, Vangas, Kausalas, Magadhas, Pun\u1e0dras, Mithilas, the inhabitants of the district of Girivraja and T\u0101malipt\u0101 come to grief.\n\n15, 16. Saturn moving in Uttara-Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, destroys the Da\u00e7\u0101r\u1e47as, Yavanas, Ujjain, the \u00c7abaras, the mountaineers of P\u0101riy\u0101tra, and the Kuntibhojas; in \u00c7rava\u1e47a, judges, eminent Brahmans, physicians, chaplains, and the Kalingas. When the planet stands in Dhanish\u1e6dh\u0101, the king of Magadh\u0101 conquers, and treasurers thrive.\n\n17. During the planet\u2019s remaining in \u00c7atabhishaj and P\u016brva-Bhadrapad\u0101, some among the physicians, poets, distillers, traders, and politicians are distressed; so are rivers, cartwrights, women, and gold, by Saturn moving in Uttara-Bhadrapad\u0101.\n\n18. When Saturn is moving in Revat\u012b, persons maintained by kings, the inhabitants of Kraunca-dv\u012bpa, the autumnal corn, \u00c7abaras and Yavanas are crushed.\n\n19. When Jupiter is moving in Vi\u00e7\u0101kh\u0101, while Saturn stands in K\u1e5bttik\u0101, then most horrible calamity befalls the people; when both planets are staying in one mansion, there will be civil feud.\n\n20. If Saturn is variegated, he destroys the birds; if yellow, he causes danger of famine; if blood-red, he threatens danger of the sword; and if ashy-coloured, he occasions many quarrels.\n\n21. If he is spotless bright, showing the lustre of the beryl, he brings good to the people. He is also auspicious if showing the hue of the blue Barleria and flax-flower. Agreeably to the statements of the Seers, Saturn is destructive to the members of such and such a caste, the colour of which he happens to assume.\n\n---\n\n1 \u0928\u091a\u0940 in the printed text is an erratum for \u0928\u091a\u0940.\n2 In the text \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u092a\u093f is an error for \u092f\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u092a\u093f.\nChapter XI.\n\nThe Course of Comets.\n\n1. After a previous study of the Course of Comets by Garga, Par\u00e2\u00e7ara, Asita-Devala, and many other authorities, I undertake now to treat this subject in such a way as to remove perplexity.\n\n2. The rising or setting of comets cannot be known by astronomical rule, as there are three different kinds of them; celestial, atmospheric, and terrestrial.\n\n3. Anything which, without fire, has an igneous appearance, is a species of blazing star, except glow-worms, meteors on the graves, gems, jewels, and the like.\n\n4. Atmospheric lights are such as are (occasionally observed) on banners, swords, dwellings, trees, horses, elephants; celestial ones are seen among the asterisms. Such as do not belong to these two descriptions are terrestrial Ketus.\n\n5. Some state that there are 101 comets; others, that there are 1,000; the Seer N\u00e2rada declares there is only one comet, which assumes different shapes.\n\n6. What does it matter, whether there is but one or more?\n\n---\n\n1 These are, according to Utpala, K\u00e2\u00e7yapa, Rshiputra, N\u00e2rada, Vajra, etc. From Vajra very little is known. I surmise that it is synonymous with Par\u00e2\u00e7ara (cf. Atharva V. 6, 65, 1) and Garga (see footnote at ch. i. 3).\n\n2 The term pi\u00e7\u00e2c\u00e2laya is, to my knowledge, nowhere explained. As the Pi\u00e7\u00e2cas are supposed to have their favourite abodes in the cemeteries, I think that phosphorical phenomena so common in burial grounds are so termed.\n\n3 From this definition it appears that the term ketu admits of no exact rendering; generally it denotes \"comets,\" but the terrestrial and atmospheric ketus are most likely phosphoric and electric phenomena, as well as falling stars and gaseous lights in morasses. I cannot forbear recalling to the memory of the reader the lines in Byron's \"Manfred\": \"When the moon is on the wave,\" etc.\nThe effects, though, should at all events be told, along with their rising, setting, place, contact, hazy covering and colour.\n\n7. The number of months wherein the comets show their influence is equal to the number of days during which they are visible; in the same manner the number of years corresponds to that of months. The effects begin to take place after forty-five days.\\(^1\\)\n\n8. A comet which is short, small, serene, glossy, not crooked, white, and appearing but for a short time, or only perceived just rising,\\(^2\\) brings abundance and happiness.\n\n9. If a comet shows an appearance the reverse of the forementioned, it is not auspicious, especially if it resembles a rainbow, or has two or three crests.\\(^3\\)\n\n10. Twenty-five comets with crests, and shining like a necklace of pearls, jewels or gold, are termed \"the Kira\u1e47as.\" They are visible in the eastern and western region,\\(^4\\) and occasion quarrels amongst sovereigns. They are the offspring of the Sun.\n\n11. Even as many stars resembling in colour to parrots, fire, the Dophariya-flower, lac or blood, are visible in the south-west, boding danger of fire. They are the sons of Fire.\n\n12. As many others, with crooked crests, and rough and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Comm. confesses that the statement is not very clear\u2014\u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u091c\u0940 \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0939 \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e\u092e\u0915\u092e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n\\(^2\\) Utpala r. \u0905\u0919\u094d\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u091c\u0940, and explains \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0907\u0937\u094d\u091f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u092f\u0926\u093f \u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092e\u0947\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n\\(^3\\) i.e. in common parlance, \"tail.\"\n\n\\(^4\\) Utpala remarks that the whole number of them is not visible at the same time, but each of them separately. This rule is of general application: \u090f\u0924\u093e\u0902 \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u090f\u0935 \u0926\u0943\u0936\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947\u0964 \u0928 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u092f\u0941\u0917\u092a\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u093d\u092f\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093e\u0964\ndark, appear in the south. Being the sons of Death, they forebode pestilence.\n\n13. Twenty-two stars, radiant, but without crest, in appearance round, like a mirror, and resembling water or oil, visible in the north-east, are the children of Earth, and threaten with famine.\n\n14. Three comets shining like to moon-light, silver, hoarfrost, the white lotus or jessamine, show themselves in the north. They are the sons of the Moon, and bring plenty.\n\n15. There is a single comet, with three crests and three colours, the offspring of the Creator. Know that this star, which may rise in any quarter, is called \"Brahma's rod,\" and foretells the end of the world.\n\n16. Herewith are enumerated the 101 comets. I shall now proceed to indicate the tokens by which the 899 (other) comets may be clearly recognized.\n\n17. In the north and north-east rise the so-called eighty-four comets, the sons of Hesperus. They show large and white stars, a soft brilliancy, and produce hard effects.\n\n18. Sixty stars, termed \"the Gold comets,\" children of Saturn, are glossy, resplendent, and double-crested. They may appear in any quarter, and have a most deleterious influence.\n\n---\n\n1 The same number is given by Par\u0101\u00e7ara; yet the enumeration differs in detail: \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0903 | \u0936\u0924\u092e\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0902 \u0915\u0947\u0924\u0941\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f | \u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0902 \u092f\u094b\u0921\u0936 \u092e\u0943\u0926\u0941\u0928\u093f: \u0916\u093e\u0938\u091c\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0938\u092d\u0935\u093e \u0926\u0936 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u091a\u092e\u0916\u0935\u093f\u0932\u092f\u0947 \u0930\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0927\u091c\u093e: \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u092a\u0948\u0924\u093e\u092e\u0939\u093e: \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941 \u091a\u0942\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0940\u0939\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092a\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e: \u0938\u092e\u0926\u0936 \u092e\u0930\u094b\u091a\u093f\u0915\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e\u091f\u091c\u093e: \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u093e\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0938\u091c\u093e: | \u091a\u092f\u094b \u0935\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u0941\u0938\u0941\u0924\u093e: | \u0927\u0942\u092e\u094b-\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0935\u0936\u0940\u0915: | \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0936 \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947 - \u092e\u0943\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u094b\u092e\u0947\u0928 \u0938\u0939 \u0938\u092e\u0942\u0924\u093e: | \u090f\u0915\u0926\u0941 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e-\u0915\u094b\u092a\u091c\u0903 | \u0907\u0924\u093f || The \u1e5ashi Audd\u0101lika is only another form of Udd\u0101laka, for in mythology father and son, i.e. the earlier and later phases of the same phenomenon, get naturally confounded. \u0106veta-ketu, \"the white comet,\" the well-known fabled teacher in the Upanishads and Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, is, as the name by itself clearly shows, a star, and not a man. Cf. v. 37 below.\n19. The \"hairless\" comets, the offspring of Jupiter, have no crest, and one bright nucleus. These, sixty-five in number, are fulgent, appear in the south, and are of evil augury.\n\n20. The fifty-one, named the \"Thieves,\" sons of Mercury, are faint, not very clear, long and white; they may rise in any direction, and produce evil effects.\n\n21. Ill-omened, too, are the children of Mars, sixty in number, who look like blood or fire, and show three crests and three kernels. These, styled the \"Saffron-coloured\" comets, are visible in the north.\n\n22. The thirty-three sons of R\u0101hu, nominated the \"Opa-cous wedges,\" show themselves on the disk of sun and moon. What they presage, has been told in the chapter headed\u2014The Sun's Course.\u00b9\n\n23. A hundred-and-twenty others, called the \"Omniform\" comets, are the offspring of Fire. They are enwrapt in a blazing circle, and occasion dreadful fires.\n\n24. Seventy-seven comets, of dark red hue, without a nucleus, with diffuse rays, and in the shape of chowries, are the sons of Air. These, known by the appellation of the \"Red,\" are rough in appearance, and bring evil.\n\n25. Eight other comets, named the \"Heap,\" because resembling a cluster of stars, are children of the Creator. The 204, called the square comets, are likewise his offspring.\u00b2\n\n26. Thirty-two, sons of Varu\u1e47a, termed the \"Herons,\" have the shape of a bamboo or shrub. These, brilliant as the moon, are said to have cruel effects.\n\n27. Ninety-six, styled the \"Trunks,\" as bearing the shape of headless bodies, are children of Time. These comets, whose nucleus lacks distinctness, are malign and dreadful.\u00b3\n\n28. The nine comets, rising in the nine quarters, show one bright and great star. So much for the general description of the thousand comets; I shall now enter into details.\n\n\u00b9 ch. iii. 7.\n\u00b2 It is to be understood, as the scholiast adds, that these have an evil influence: \u092a\u093e\u092a\u092b\u0932\u093e \u090f\u0935 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0903 | \u0924\u0947 \u091a\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0926\u093f\u0915\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u0903 |\n\u00b3 Utpala follows another reading (see Var. Lect.) and explains accordingly, \"bring safety to the Pu\u1e47\u1e0dras.\"\n29. The Fat comet rises in the west, stretching far to the northward; is large and of glossy appearance. It causes instant mortality, yet egregious abundance too.\n\n30. The Bone comet, having the same characteristics, save that it is rough, is said to bring frightful famine. Another, known as the Sword comet, having the same appearance, except that it is smooth, and rises in the east, occasions affrays and pestilence.\n\n31. The Skull comet, with purple-tinged rays and crest, becomes visible at the day of new moon, in the east, and extends its course through half the heavens; it causes famine, mortality, drought, and sickness.\n\n32. The comet of Rudra rises in the east, on the path of Fire,\\(^1\\) with a crest in the shape of a trident, and with a blackish, rough or red glare. It extends its course over a third part of heaven, and has the same effects as the former.\n\n33. In the west rises the Movable comet, whose crest is an inch high, and turned to the south. It is steadily increasing in length the more it proceeds to the north.\n\n34. As it has come near the asterism of the Great Bear, the pole-star and Abhijit (Vega), it goes back, and having moved through half the firmament, sets in the south.\n\n35. It will destroy the country from Pray\u00e2ga, on the Ganges, as far as Ujjain and Pushkar\u00e2ranya,\\(^2\\) and northwards up to the river Devik\u00e2, along with the greatest part of the middle country.\n\n36. Some parts of other countries, too, will be stricken by diseases and famine. Its influence will be felt for ten months, or, according to others, for eighteen.\n\n37. The White comet will be visible in the east, at midnight, with a crest pointing to the south, and another, named Ka,\\(^3\\) resembling a yoke, in the west. Both will be seen at the same time, during seven days.\n\n\\(^1\\) In the printed text r., of course, \u0935\u0948\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0930. As to the path of Fire, cf. ch. ix. 3.\n\n\\(^2\\) The erratum in the text needs scarcely to be pointed out.\n\n\\(^3\\) In Par\u00e2\u00e7ara is added, \u201cKa, the son of the Creator,\u201d \u0915\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u093e-\n38. Both bring plenty and luck, if they be smooth. Should Ka be seen for a longer period, then he bodes distress from the fury of the sword during ten years.\n\n39. When the White comet resembles a tuft of hair, is rough and darkish, and when, after moving through a third part of the firmament, it retrogrades from right to left,\\(^1\\) then it destroys two-thirds of the population.\n\n40. A hairy star with purple-tinged crest, becoming visible near the Pleiads, is known as the Radiant comet. It has the same effects as the last-mentioned.\n\n41. The Dhruva-ketu\\(^2\\) has no determined course, dimension, colour, or form, and may appear in any direction, as well in the heavens as in the sky, or on the earth. If fulgent, it has agreeable results.\n\n42. But the princes on whose warlike equipments,\\(^3\\) the countries on whose dwellings, trees, and hills, and the householders on whose implements this luminary is seen, are doomed to destruction.\n\n43. The comet termed the Water-lily, as bearing the hue of that flower, appears for one night in the west, with its crest tending to the east. It brings surely uncommon abundance throughout ten years.\n\n44. The Gem comet, visible but once, for the space of one\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Utpala : \u091a\u093e\u092a\u0938\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d \u091a\u093e\u092a\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0902\u0964 \u0935\u093e\u092e\u092d\u093e\u0917\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0915\u0930\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n\\(^{2}\\) The rendering would be \u201cthe firm, fixed comet,\u201d but this does not agree with the description.

Cf. Amara-kosha, ii. 8, 2, 1.\nwatch, in the west, has an extremely faint nucleus; its crest is right and white, like a drop of milk from a woman's breast.\n\n45. At rising it brings abundance for four months and a half. Sometimes, however, it gives rise also to the prevalence of noxious animals.\n\n46. The Water comet appears likewise in the west; it looks glossy, and wears its crest erected in a westerly direction. It produces for nine months plenty and tranquillity among mankind.\n\n47. The Bhava-ketu, showing a faint nucleus, and shedding a soft lustre, is visible for one night in the east. Its crest, turned to the right, is like a lion's tail.\n\n48. One may predict uncommon abundance during a number of months, corresponding to that of hours for which the star continues visible. In case the comet looks rough, one may expect deadly diseases.\n\n49. The Lotus comet, white, like the fibre of the nymph\u00e6a, will be seen for one night in the west; it brings plenty and joy during seven years.\n\n50. The comet styled Avarta rises in the west, at midnight, shining bright, red-coloured, and with its crest turned southward.\u00b9 The abundance caused by it lasts as many months as is the number of hours the star is visible.\n\n51. Another, styled Samvarta, bears a purple red crest, and shows itself at twilight, in the west. After percurring a third part of the heavens, this horrible comet makes a stand, showing a crest in the shape of a trident.\n\n52. Throughout a number of years, equal to that of hours it is visible, it will slay monarchs by the sword, and vex the asterism in which it rises.\u00b2\n\n53. Now I shall set forth which kings are killed, if an asterism is touched or wrapped in haze by any other but auspicious comets.\n\n54.

Such a one in Mrgagiras, destroys the king of the U\u00e7\u00eenaras; in \u00c2rdr\u00e2, the chief of the Fishermen;\u00b9 in Punarvasu, the lord of the A\u00e7makas; in Pushya, the governor of Magadh\u00e2; in A\u00e7lesh\u00e2, the lord of the Asikas; in Magh\u00e2, the king of Anga; in P\u00fbrva-Phalgun\u00ee, the sovereign of P\u00e2\u00f1dya; in Uttara-Phalgun\u00ee, the king of Ujjain; and in Hasta, the chief of the Dan\u00e7ak\u00e2 district.\n\n57. When a comet hurts Citr\u00e2, those who are well up in the lore may predict the death of the ruler of Kuru-field. The kings of the Kashmirians and K\u00e2mbojas are annihilated, in case an evil comet stands in Sv\u00e2ti.\n\n58. If such a one stays in Vi\u00e7\u00e2kh\u00e2, the sovereigns of the Ikshv\u00e2kus and of Alak\u00e2\u00b2 are killed; if in Anur\u00e2dh\u00e2, the Pundra chieftain; and if in Jyeshth\u00e2, the emperor is slain.\n\n59, 60.

It is he who, in the days of yore, at once heightened the splendour of the ocean, by causing the water to vanish: the rocky peaks, scooped out by the claws of sea-monsters, were no longer covered with waves, but with a rolling tide of the choicest gems and jewels, blended with dropping pearls, as if to abash the gods with their bright jewelled crowns.\n\n2. It is he who increased the magnificence of the sea, although he bereft her of the water, since the treeless cliffs showed coral-trees, precious stones, and jewels, and glittering snakes coming forth in long rows.\n\n3. It is he who, by swallowing the waters of the great\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e. in common parlance, \"bright Canopus.\" Agasti, of which agastya is a produced form, is derived with suffix (or seeming suffix) asti, like gabhasti, from the base aj, anj, \"to brighten,\" a meaning especially apparent from \u0905\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f, \u0905\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f.

From the same base is \u0905\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093f \"fire,\" \u0905\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093f \"an ornament,\" and probably \u0905\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093f, as well as Greek \u1f00\u03ba\u03c4\u03af\u03c2.\n\n\\(^2\\) The myths alluded to are so well known, chiefly from the R\u00e2m\u00e2yana and Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata, that they require no other indication.\nocean, brought it to grief, but, at the same time, to a state of lustre, such as immortals only know, through the sparkling dolphins, water-elephants, serpents, and the jewels scattered round about.\\(^1\\)\n\n4. The ocean, bereft, indeed, of its water, but covered with floundering dolphins, pearl-oysters, and conch-shells was lovely as the lake in autumn, with its rippling waves, water-lilies, and swans.\n\n5. It is he who made the sea shine as heaven, with dolphins for its white clouds, with precious stones for stars, with crystal for its moon, with its drained bottom for a serene harvest sky, and with the radiant gems in the hoods of snakes for comets and planets.\n\n6. The Vindhya stands raising its shaking summits, in order to mar the road to the Day-god\u2019s chariot; like banners gaily float on high the garments which support the disturbed Elves (in moving through the sky), who are eagerly pressing to their bosom their dear loves clinging to their shoulders; the mountain waterfalls, issuing from the caves, are haunted by lions, from whose heads hang, like chaplets of blue Barlerias, clusters of bees following the scent of the elephant\u2019s frontal juice mingled with the quaffed blood; it seems as if\n\n\\(^1\\) The scholiast understands \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092b\u0941\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093f\u091c\u0932\u092d\u091c\u093f\u0939\u094d\u0928\u0903 to have a double meaning: the first and natural one as rendered above; the other, as referring to \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b, as follows: \u0924\u0925\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0930\u0932\u094b\u0915\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092b\u0941\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093f\u091c\u0932\u092d\u091c\u093f\u0939\u094d\u0928\u0903\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092b\u0941\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093f\u091c\u0932\u092d\u091c\u093f\u0939\u094d\u0928\u0903\u0964 \u0924\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0917\u094d\u0928 \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093e\u0939\u0928\u0903 \u0915\u0947\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0964 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0924\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0928\u0926\u0940\u0964 \u0915\u0947\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u091c\u0932\u0917\u0903 \u092a\u093e\u0928\u0940\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0925\u0903\u0964 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923\u0903\u0964 \u0915\u0947\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092d\u0917\u093e \u0939\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u092a\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0917\u0924\u0903\u0964 \u092f\u0925\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0907\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0923\u0903\u0964 \u0915\u0947\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092d\u0903 \u0915\u0941\u091f\u093f\u0932\u0902 \u0917\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f \u091c\u093f\u0939\u094d\u0928\u0903\u0964 \u0915\u0941\u091f\u093f\u0932\u0917\u0924\u0903\u0964 \u092f\u0925\u093e \u092d\u094c\u092e\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923\u0903 \u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0965 Now, waiving some minor points, e.g. the inaccuracy of identifying prasphurat with calat, it will be observed that the animal on which an image is represented to sit has little to do with the god\u2019s \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940; most certainly the retrogradation of Mars does not show his \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940. In short, the second explanation is devoid of meaning.\nthe mountain is to touch the roof of the sky with his reared rocky tops, where hyenas, bears, tigers, and monkeys dwell, and crowds of inebriated bees, troubled and startled by the elephants pulling down the blossoming trees, tune their humming sounds; the Narmad\u00e2 embraces, like a loving damsel in amorous sport, the mountain, where immortals frequent the pleasure-grounds, and sages live without other food but water, roots, and air. Such was the Vindhya, when he was stemmed by Agastya. Listen ye now to the description of the Seer\u2019s appearance.\n\n7. At the rise of Agastya, the waters, which (during the rains) have grown soiled, through the contact with mud, become clean spontaneously, like the heart of the virtuous.\n\n8.

In the same manner the A\u00e7vins restore youth to Cyav\u00e2na or Cyavana (alias Bhrgu\u2019s son), i.e. Bhrgu (Hesperus) is born again as Bhrgu-putra (Lucifer).\n\n2 \u0915\u0941\u0938\u092e\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0917\u092e\u0932\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0942\u0937\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f has a double meaning.

The earth, replete with pools that abound in a motley variety of lotuses, swans, ruddy geese and ducks, presents, as it were, a hospitable gift of jewels, many flowers and fruits to Agastya.\n\n12.

He rises (thus it has been said of yore) when the sun is standing in Hasta, and sets when the sun has reached Rohini.\\(^1\\)\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XIII.**\n\n*The Course of the Seven Seers (Great Bear).*  \n\n1, 2. I shall tell, according to the theory of Vrddha-Garga, the course of those Seven Seers by whom the northern region is, as it were, protected; through whom she shines, as if adorned with a string of pearls, like a maiden with joyful countenance, wearing a wreath of white water-lilies; those Seven Seers by the turning round of whom the northern region seems dancing, the pole-star being the regulator.\n\n3. The Seven Seers were in Magh\u00e2, when king Yudhishthira ruled the earth, and the period of that king is 2526 years before the \u00c7\u00e2ka era.\\(^2\\)\n\n4.

On the contrary, Utpala expressly intimates that the rising of Canopus, when the sun stands in Hasta, is contrary to science, and only repeated by the author out of deference for the Ancients. He says \u0915\u093f\u0902\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0917\u092e\u0938\u0942\u091a\u0928\u093f, which is quite true; where our author uses \u0915\u093f\u0932\u094d, it is so much as *relata refeo*; \u092f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f \u0917\u0923\u093f\u0924\u0938\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0928 \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0924\u0925\u093e \u092a\u093e\u091a\u093e\u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0902 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0915\u094d\u0930\u0924\u092e\u0964 The three periods of rising are enumerated by Par\u00e2\u00e7ara, as quoted by Utpala.

At the eastern extremity stands Mar\u00eeci; next to him in westerly direction is Vasishtha; next to whom Angiras; then Atri, next to whom Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu, in regular succession, beginning from the east. Arundhat\u00ee, that pattern of spouses, is seen next to Vasishtha.\n\n7. When these luminaries are pale, devoid of beams, faint or vexed by meteors, thunderbolts, haze, and such-like, they will destroy each their own dependency; on the contrary, they tend to make the same prosper, in case they seem large and bright.\n\n8. Mar\u00eeci is understood to have power of doing harm to Gandharvas, gods, demons, spells, herbs, angels, goblins, dragons, and elves.\n\n1 Cf. Colebrooke, Misc. Essays, ii. p. 356. The other reading of the latter part is rendered by Colebrooke, \"Being connected with that particular Nakshatra, to which, when it rises in the East, the line of their rising is directed.\" This does not agree with the Sanskrit words, as given by Colebrooke in a foot-note, but these are evidently misprinted.

Now, we have to r. \u092f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0942\u091a\u0938\u0902\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0903: in the text, for \u0916\u094d\u0924\u094d and \u0938\u0942 are regularly confounded; in the Comm. \u0924\u093f\u092a\u093e\u0923\u093f is, in both instances, an error for \u0930\u093f\u092a\u093e (\u0930\u093f\u092c\u093e), and this the word by which \u0938\u0942\u091a of the text was rendered. The passage is debased to such an extent that the hand of Utpala is only partially visible.\n\n2 Consequently, the stars \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, and \u03b7, of the Great Bear, correspond to Kratu, Pulaha, Pulastya, Atri, Angiras, Vasishtha, and Mar\u00eeci. Arundhat\u00ee must be the small star near \u03b6, called Alcor or \u03b3.\n\n3 Mentioned in the subsequent verses.\n9. Vasishtha, when hurt, is deadly to the Scythians, Yavanas, Dards, P\u00e2ratas, K\u00e2mbojas, and hermits living in the wilderness; he gives prosperity, when he is radiant.\n\n10. Scholars, wise men, and Brahmans are enumerated as belonging to Angiras; and foresters, aquatic produces, the sea and rivers are allotted to Atri.\n\n11. To Pulastya are said to belong giants, devils, children of darkness, fiends and serpents; to Pulaha, roots, and fruits; and to Kratu, sacrifices and sacrificers.\n\nChapter XIV.\n\nDivision of the Globe.\u00b9\n\n1. Each group of three lunar mansions, to begin with Krttik\u00e2, forms a ninth of the whole series; to each of these groups corresponds a part of the countries, the division of which begins at the centre in Bh\u00e2rata-varsha, proceeding hence to the eastward, south-eastward, and so forth.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 The word k\u00fbrma is the specific Sanskrit form of a word once common to all Indo-European tongues, viz. kurma, Lat. culmus, Teuton. holm, etc. It does not originally denote the \"tortoise\" itself, but its back, for the proper meaning is \"mound, buckle, half-globe, holm.\" Even in Sanskrit, in such compounds as k\u00fbrmonnata, the word signifies the form of the back of the tortoise. At the time when the term \u0915\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0935\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0917 became current, k\u00fbrma was taken in its proper sense. Yet in later times they wholly mistook the meaning, and made an absurd drawing, representing a tortoise, as if k\u00fbrma could denote a level! The rendering by \"globe\" is not wholly exact, since properly only a half-globe, a holm, is supposed to be raised above the waters. Cf. Ind. Stud. x. 209.\n\n\u00b2 The astrological use of this partition is, that, a particular group of Nakshatras being vexed, the corresponding group of countries suffers too, or, as Garga puts it:\n\n\u0939\u094d\u0930\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0915\u093e\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0928\u091a\u094d\u091a\u094b \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0926\u0947\u0936\u0947 \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u091a\u0926\u093e\u0964\n\u092a\u093e\u092a\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092a\u0939\u0924\u094b \u0939\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0926\u0947\u0936\u0947 \u0916\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0902\u0916\u0926\u093e\u0965\n\u0930\u0940\u0922\u093c\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0915\u094b \u0939\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0938\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092a\u0923\u093e\u0903 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0926\u0947\u0936\u093f\u0923\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\u0906\u0930\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0915\u094b \u092f\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0916\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0926\u094b \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u091c\u093e\u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0965\n2, 3, 4.

In the west are the Ma\u00f1imat and Meghavat hills,\n\n---\n\n1 It is strange here to find Sinhala after the occurrence of Lank\u0101 in v. 11.\n\n2 The Balaipatna of Ptolemy, so that the r. Palaipatna, preferred by Lassen, is proved to be a false form; see Lassen, Altert. iii. pp. 181 and 183.\n\n3 The Comm. sees two words in the compound, viz. Taimingilas and Sanas or \u00c7anas, whatever this may be.\n\n4 Some of the countries enumerated do not lie in the S.W., e.g. the K\u0101mbojas, Yavanas, Ambash\u1e6dhas, and others.\n\n5 In the astronomical Siddh\u0101ntas Va\u1e0dav\u0101mukha is the supposed abode of the dead at the South Pole.\n\n6 Synonymous with Karnapr\u0101veya is Karnapr\u0101varana. Now, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0930\u0923 is synonymous with \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f, so that \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f either stands for \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f, or \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f and \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f are derived from the same base with \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f. The M\u0101rkandeya-Pur\u0101\u1e47a 58, 31, has Karnapr\u0101dheya, in which dh is a misread v.\n\n7 Or, as another MS. has, Drami\u1e0das. There must be some Dravidian tribe in the West, perhaps the Brahui in Beluchistan, who belong to the Dravidian stock. See Caldwell, Drav. Grammar, p. 11. It is worth while remarking that Par\u0101\u00e7ara in his enumeration mentions Drami\u1e0das, Dravi\u1e0das in the East too; those seem to be the tribes of the R\u0101jmahal hills. See Caldwell, l.c.\nVanaugha, Mount Kshur\u00e2rpa\u1e47a, the Mountain of Sunset, the Apar\u0101ntakas (i.e., people of the western marches), \u00c7\u0101ntikas, Haihayas, Mount Pra\u00e7asta, the Vokk\u0101nas, the Panj\u0101b, Ramathas, P\u0101ratas, T\u0101rakshiti, the J\u1e5bngas, Vai\u00e7yas, Gold-Scythians,\u00b9 and all the lawless hordes of barbarians living in the west.\n\n22, 23. In the north-west are the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davyas, Tukh\u0101ras, T\u0101las, \u1e24alas (or Lahas), Madras, A\u1e63makas,\u00b2 Kul\u016btas, Lahada (or La\u1e0daha),\u00b3 the kingdom of the Amazons, the Man-lions, the Woods,\u2074 the inhabitants of the sky, the rivers Ve\u1e47umati, Phalguluk\u0101, and Guruh\u0101,\u2075 the Marukuccas (or Murukuccas), Carmarangas, the One-eyed men, the S\u016blikas (or M\u016blikas), the Long-necks, Long-faces, and Long-hairs.\n\n24-28. In the north lie the mountains known as Kail\u0101sa, Him\u0101laya, Vasumat, Dhanushmat, Kraunca and Meru, the Hyperboreans, Kshudraminas, Kaikayas, Vas\u0101tis, those who live near the sources of the Jamn\u0101, Bhogapra\u1e63tha, the \u0100rjun\u0101yanas, \u0100gn\u012bdhras (or Agn\u012btyas), \u0100dar\u00e7a, Antardv\u012bpa, Trigarta, the Horse-faced, Dog-faced,\u2076 Long-haired, Flat-noses, D\u0101serakas, V\u0101\u1e6dadh\u0101nas, \u00c7aradh\u0101nas, Taksha\u00e7il\u0101, Pushkal\u0101vat\u012b, the Kail\u0101vatas, Kan\u1e6dhadh\u0101nas, Ambaras, Madrakas, M\u0101lavas, Pauravas, Kacch\u0101ras, Da\u1e47\u1e0dapingalakas, M\u0101nahalas,\n\n\u00b9 The Comm. explains differently, \u201cthe region of Gold\u201d and \u201cScythians.\u201d\n\u00b2 The Assakanoi of the Greeks.\n\u00b3 This seems to be Lahara, so frequently mentioned in R\u0101ja-taran-gin\u00ee, e.g. 7, 912, 1373 (L\u0101hara \u201cLaharian,\u201d 1173). It is a borderland betwixt Kashmir and Dardist\u0101n; to this identification of Lahara and Lahada, it will not be objected that our author, committing the grave blunder of placing Kashmir and Dardist\u0101n in the North-east (v. 29), should needs have assigned a wrong situation to Laha\u1e0da too.\n\u2074 The Comm. takes \u0928\u0943\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939\u0935\u0928\u0902 for one word.\n\u2075 Guruh\u0101 (also Garuh\u0101) is, to my apprehension, the Garoigas of the Greeks; the river district they called Goryaia. Lassen, in his Altert. iii. p. 127 and 136, identifies the Greek name with Gaur\u0101. It need not be pointed out how exactly both forms coincide with Garuh\u0101 and Guruh\u0101.\n\u2076 R. with one MS. of the Comm. \u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e\u0928\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0903.\nHuns, Kohalas, \u00c7itakas (or \u00c7\u00e2takas), M\u00e2ndavyas, the city of the Spirits,\\(^1\\) the Gandharians, the town of Ya\u00e7ovati,\\(^2\\) the Hemat\u00e2las, Kshatriyas,\\(^3\\) the inhabitants of the sky, Gavyas, Yaudheyas, D\u00e2sameyas, \u00c7yam\u00e2kas, and Kshemadh\u00fbrtas.\n\n29-31.

IV.\u2014The Pongol Festival in Southern India.\n\nBy Charles E. Gover.\n\nRead November 29, 1869.\n\nLong before I had set foot in India I had been greatly struck by the exceedingly different statements regarding its people which were made by those who knew them best. Some, and notably the missionaries, could find no language strong enough to express the utter abomination of Hindu life and custom. Every chapter of Ward's great work teems with phrases of the strongest reprobation. The ceremonies he describes are indeed vile, and it cannot be said that his condemnation is too strong. On the other hand, civil and military officers, of the highest integrity and the closest observation, have set up the Hindus as models which it would be greatly to the benefit of Europeans to follow. They saw in the Hindu village system, and the ordinary life of the villagers, a living type of patriarchal happiness, uprightness, and wisdom. Major Scott Waring may be taken as a type of such men. The discussions in Parliament upon the clauses of the great India Bill that permitted the appointment of Bishops, and opened India to mission work, are full of illustrations of this contradiction; and I can well remember when, as a boy, I waded through the reports, being struck with wonder that men who had lived side by side in India, who had gained enormous experience and possessed the ability to learn the lessons that experience should teach, could, by any possibility, arrive at conclusions so diverse. After many years spent in close intercourse with the people of India, I do not wonder now. On one occasion both views of the question were brought vividly before me. I had seen the Pongol, the touching domestic festival it is now my chief object to describe. It had proved by its simple pathos that the Hindus were akin to the noblest nations of the world, and that in their\nantiquity they were worthy of the honour that has come to them, of being the best and the least altered representatives of the *Juventus Mundi*, which all nations count to have been the Golden Age.\n\nFrom this, by the rapid transition afforded by the modern railway, I went straight into the great temple of Seringham, near Trichinopoly. What a new world was this! The idol ear, bright with gilt and gaudy colours, was loaded with carvings of the obsceneest possible character. Vice was rampant there. It rioted in the *phallus*. As I passed the gigantic monolithic gates, which admitted the devout from enclosure to enclosure, it was impossible to escape the brilliant frescoes which adorned (?) the roof, far up, the nearest thing to heaven, in all that temple! How can I describe, or even hint at, what was there? In the most sacred shrine of Southern India, which contests the palm of sanctity with holy Benares\u2014carved and painted in every ring, increasing in abomination as the shrine was approached\u2014above the heads, on every side, yes, and under the feet of the thousands of men, women, and children who throng the place\u2014the application and essence of every Pauranic story told by the priests\u2014were these paintings, larger than life, with every detail of obscenity magnified out of all proportion. It required no very close observation to learn that these were but outward signs of what was daily performed and honoured within the holy precincts. Here was ample justification for every epithet employed by Ward, Dubois, or Wilberforce. Yet the Pongol declared, with equal force, in favour of domestic love and chastity, of simple thanksgiving and rural contentment. Both are right. Both are wrong. The key of the anomaly lies in this fact\u2014that Brahmanism is not Hinduism\u2014that the theocracy of the sacred caste has not permeated and indurated the other castes, that is, the mass of the people\u2014that the religious and social aspects of society are vastly different. The Brahmans are so much more intelligent, learned, supple, and pleasant to deal with than the common people, that almost all writers have confined themselves to Brahmanical life, and (though not often saying so)\nhave led most people to imagine that India is what the Brahmins are. It has thus come to pass that those who have not deliberately set themselves to try to understand the people, that is the nineteen out of every twenty of the population, have taken all their ideas from a class. The recent spread of Sanskrit knowledge has tended to the same end, for none but Brahmins know Sanskrit, and the whole of its more recent literature is Brahmanic, written to forward the purposes of the sacred caste. The civil and military servants of Government have always been so overworked that they have had no time to write, except on official subjects. While they lived, they, almost to a man, were stout defenders and apologists of the Hindus, but their evidence was but verbal; writ in water, it perished with them. There has, therefore, been no counterpoise to the pressure of Brahmanic influence. The result has been that there is, at the present time, next to nothing known of the common people, the Vaisyas and Sudras of the Hindu economy. This is the more to be regretted, because it not unfrequently happens that the lowest strata of society contain fossilized remnants of Aryanism as it was first introduced into India. The present Brahmanic system is the result of centuries of steady growth. The stages of this growth may be traced. As Brahmanism arose, Aryanism decreased. The Vedas were superseded by the Puranas, and Vedic ceremonies have given way to the monstrous pile of devotion built upon the deeds of Vishnu and Siva, Rama, Krishna, and Kali. The result of this has been that there may often be found, among the masses, types of primitive custom, which have long ago passed from the literature and practice of the priest caste. There is much reason to suppose that the Pongol is one of the most complete and interesting of these remnants of primitive life. That it is primitive is shown by the fact that the old Vedic deities are alone worshipped. Indra is the presiding deity; Agni is the main object of worship. A further proof of this point is given by the efforts that have constantly been made by the Brahmins to corrupt the ritual, and introduce Pauranic deities. Krishna is always declared by the Brahmins to be the Pongol god, but the tradition itself bears\nwitness that the feast is older than the god. The tale is, that when the great wave of Krishna worship passed over the Peninsula, the people were so enamoured of him that they ceased to perform the Pongol rites to Indra. This made the latter deity so angry that he poured down a flood upon the earth. The affrighted people ran to Krishna, who seized the great mountain Govardhana, wrenched it from its place, and held it aloft on the tip of his little finger, like some huge umbrella. The people then ran beneath with their flocks and were saved, until Indra saw that his wrath was vain. Thus runs the story, and the conclusion is, that a grateful people dethroned Indra from his presidency of the Pongol and placed Krishna in his stead. Though the whole influence of the Brahmans has been brought to bear upon the point, the rustic conservatism of the cultivators has been able to withstand it, and everywhere Indra is the King of the Pongol. In very Brahmanic districts a compromise has been effected, by which Krishna and Indra share the honours of the feast.\n\nThe occasion of the festival is also primitive, for the Pongol is another feast of ingathering, the centre of Hebrew festivals, as this is of those of Southern India. Just as, when the Hebrews passed from their bondage into the land flowing with milk and honey, their joy at the change showed itself in the \"ingathering,\" so did the Aryan wanderers from the plains of Central Asia, and their hard fare and scanty crops, hail with joy the fruitful plains of India. It was indeed to them the blessed land. As they found that \"when they tickled the ground with a plough, the fields laughed with golden crops,\" they could not but celebrate the beneficent return of the seasons, and adore the elemental gods that blessed them. This of itself, however, will not prove the festival to be Aryan, although, combined with the proofs already and to be given, it will help to deepen our conviction of the recognition. But there can be no doubt that the Indian immigrants were previously a pastoral tribe, rich in horses, cattle, and sheep, and proud of the four-footed friends that carried them to the hunt or the battle, fed their families with milk and\nbutter, and were their indefatigable servants in the field. Hence they would bring with them an almost Arab love of animals. When they rejoiced over their ingathering they would not forget the dumb friends of their pastoral homes. However that may be, the Pongol is remarkable, as will be seen when the description is given, for the strange combination of pastoral, hunting, and agricultural life. There are \"Harvest Homes\" in almost every nation that owns fruitful fields, but I do not know of any other example of the combination. The great days of the feast are two\u2014one of these is devoted to the new crops, the other to the cattle alone. As will be seen, the cattle are treated with every imaginable honour, while the feast winds up with a grand hunt, first, of the cattle themselves, and next of a hare.\n\nThe exceeding simplicity of the ritual is another point to which I would ask attention. All who have studied the subject know that Brahmanism is remarkable above all things for its wondrous complexity.\n\nSo marked is this that after every important ceremonial the officiating priest has to offer a last oblation, and repeat a parting mantra to cleanse the guilt that must accrue from any forgetfulness on his part. The rosary is as much used by them as by Roman nuns, and for the same purpose.\n\nLong before the commencement of the feast, an unwonted activity pervades native society. The Pongol is the social festival of the year, and must be celebrated with due honour, else an ineffaceable stain will rest on the family name. It is the Christmas and Whitsuntide of England made into one, and must be treated accordingly. So as soon as the rains have finished, and this may be expected by about the first week in December, the carpenter, the builder, and the artist, are in full work repairing the houses. The inner walls of the verandah are adorned with the brilliant water colour drawings which take the place of the frescoes of Pompeii. The village soucar's house must be especially grand, else folks would doubt his ability to lend his usual advances upon the next crop. A very favourite representation is that of an English soldier prostrate beneath the feet of an infuriate tiger,\nwho glares at the sepoy who is bravely trying to rescue his pale comrade. Incidents in the life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very frequently given, while Gane\u015ba the bellygod squats on his rat over the door.\n\nWhen the house is ready, the housewife takes up the work. She has to buy new vessels of every kind, for it would be dreadful if the new rice were to be boiled in an old vessel. So the sides of the road in the bazaar are heaped with \"chatties\" of all sizes and shapes. Meanwhile the father of the family goes to buy new clothes for the children. The little girl, just beginning to walk, must receive her first bangle or necklace; the eldest boy must have a gold mohur to hang from his ear, or serve for a button on his vest. The master himself wants a new turban or cummerbund. All these must be bought at Pongol. Nor is this all. The family is an undivided one, and some of its younger members are serving as writers in the Hoozoor Cutcherry twenty miles away, striving to eke out small salaries. A present must go to each of them. They have no fields of their own from which to get their rice, so a sack of the new grain from the ancestral acres goes off to each. To this is added a pot of ghee, a set of brass pots, or perhaps a jewel; that the Pongol may not lack wherewith to make it joyful. This universal kindness is most pleasant to see, and of course still more gratifying to give and take. Nor does the gentle and kindly influence of the time cease here. The files of the Munsifs' court will have been crammed with cases from litigious enemies or greedy money lenders. But as Pongol comes round many of them disappear. The creditor thinks of his debtor, the debtor of the creditor. The one relents, the other is ashamed, and both parties are saved by a compromise. Often it happens that a process is postponed \"till after Pongol.\"\n\nAll must be ready by the early part of January, when, according to the Hindu astrologers, the sun enters the tropic of Capricorn. The feast hangs upon this, and it will be seen that the most interesting event of the celebration must exactly coincide with the passage of the sun. The festival com-\nmences on the previous day, and lasts for seven days; of which the second marks the sun's passage, and is called Mah\u00e2 (or Great) Pongol. For some days previously, however, the boys have been busy gathering sticks, straw, bratties (cakes of cowdung), dead leaves, and everything else that will burn. These have been carefully hidden and guarded, lest those whose heap of \"plunder\" was small, might poach upon their neighbours' preserves. Even the old folks are not supposed to know anything, so that their first view of the pile may have all the charm of novelty. We will suppose then that all is ready on the eve of the feast. Next day is Bh\u00f4gi Pongol or Pongol of Rejoicing, but it is equally well known by the name of Indra, to whom the day is dedicated. Long before sunrise all are awake, the boys first of course, for they are the heroes of the hour. Routing out their elders from their places of repose, they lead them with shouting and leaping to the pile they have collected. When all are gathered shivering in the cold morning air, the leading youngster applies the torch, and in a moment a vivid flame leaps up into the sky. At the same time every street and lane has its bonfire, and far away to the horizon the gleam of the fires reddens the murky gloom. The young folks leap over the fire as it sinks, or heap on fresh fuel. The old folks stand around and tell of the glorious fires they made in \"the good old times,\" when men were different from what they are now. This fire is the oblation to S\u00fbrya, the Sun-god, or rather to Agni, and wakes him from his sleep, calling on him to again exert his power and gladden the earth with his light and heat. It is not easy to discover the origin of this curious feature of the day's proceedings, but there are very many passages in the Rig Veda which prove that something similar preceded every great festival. Compare, for instance, Rig Veda, i. 44, 9 (Wilson's translation, vol. i. p. 120), \"Thou, Agni, art the protector of the sacrifices of the people, and the messenger (of the gods); bring hither to-day the gods awaking at dawn.\" Again, Rig Veda, i. 45, 7 (Wilson, i. p. 122), \"The wise have placed thee, Agni, in (their) sacrifices as the invoker.\" Again, Rig Veda, i. 36, 2 (Wilson, i.\np. 100), we find\u2014\"Men have recourse to Agni, the augmenter of vigour; offering oblations, we worship thee; do thou, liberal giver of food, be well disposed to us here this day, and be our protector.\" In fact, there are many passages that would seem to show that Agni held among the Vedic races the position now filled by Ganesa, the god of good luck, the averter of obstacles, the messenger to and from the gods, who must be propitiated before any attempt is made to adore another god, else the prayer of the devotee would be spoiled in the carriage to the localities where the gods dwell, and be rendered a source of ill rather than of good. There are other passages which will be quoted further on, which prove that the crops, the cattle, and generally the provision of food, was under the control of Agni, and thus his worship at the ingathering assumed and maintained unwonted importance. There is, however, one S\u00fbkta, in the first Ma\u1e47\u1e0dala of the Rig Veda, which seems clearly to point to some such universal bonfire as that which now marks the advent of Pongol. It is Rig Veda, i. 140 (Wilson, vol. ii. p. 63 ff), the second verse of which runs thus\u2014\"Agni the two-fold generated, devours the triple (sacrificial food), and when the year expires renovates what has been eaten.\" There is here a plain reference to the period of the year represented by the ingathering \"when the year expires.\" The \"renovation of what has been eaten\" is the harvest. Verses 4 and 5 point clearly to some vast celebration. \"The (flames of Agni) light-moving, dark-tracked, quick, capricious, restless, lambent, fanned by the wind, wide-spreading and ensuring liberation (to the devout), are kindled for (the benefit of) the pious reverencer of (holy) priests. Thereupon those (flames of Agni) extend together in all directions, dispersing gloom, and spreading great light along the path of darkness; when (Agni) illumes repeatedly the whole earth, and proceeds panting, thundering, and roaring aloud.\" The following verses beautifully describe the rushing of the fire, and its effect upon the earth. The last verse again draws us to the occasion and object we have in hand\u2014\"Agni, be propitiated by this our earnest praise, and may heaven and earth and the spontaneously\nflowing (streams) provide for us the produce of the field; and may the purple coursers (of the dawn) bestow upon us abundant food through a length of days.\u201d There are other passages, which need not be quoted, which show that it was common to light fires to Agni before the dawn, during the darkness of the night (Wilson, vol. i. pp. 119, 161).\u00b9 There is more difficulty in discovering why on this particular day the fires should be lighted by the boys. But perhaps even this point may be elucidated. I would only refer to the fact that Agni is frequently called the youngest of the gods, he is invoked as \u201cJuvenile Agni,\u201d as knowing \u201call that are born.\u201d The very season may have something to do with it. Harvest is the \u201crenovating\u201d period, the time of reproduction, the provision for children; and, as in many other countries, it was natural that the rejoicings of the ingathering should be initiated by the boys, who, alone in a Hindu household, may without shame exhibit tokens of exuberant joy. There are no dancing maidens; no light-heeled men. Manhood with the Hindu is a time of gravity and self-respect, and women may never join in a public celebration. Others more learned than myself may be able to follow up this part of my subject.\n\nThe feast is now begun, and all turn from the fire as it is extinguished by the rising sun, to the bath with which every\n\n\u00b9 In Max M\u00fcller\u2019s elaborate paper on the sixth hymn of the first book of the Rig Veda in the Journal R.A.S. for 1867, page 225, occurs the following translation:\u2014\u201cThou, O Agni J\u0101tavedas, hast carried, when implored, the offerings which thou hast rendered sweet. Thou hast given them to the fathers, they fed on their share. Eat thou, O god, the proffered oblations. Our fathers who are here, and those who are not here, our fathers whom we know, and those whom we do not know, thou knowest how many they are, O J\u0101tavedas, accept the well-made sacrificial portions. They who, whether burnt by fire or not burnt by fire, rejoice in their offering in the midst of heaven, give to them, O king, that life, and thy (their) own body, according to thy will.\u201d The first two sentences clearly point to Agni as the messenger to and from the gods, and therefore to be invoked at the commencement of the sacrifice. The next phrase\u2014\u201cEat thou, O God, the proffered oblations,\u201d is still the ordinary form in which the offering is made. Can the next very remarkable phrase refer to a family gathering, when \u201cour fathers who are here, and those who are not here,\u201d that is, the present heads of the family and those who are dead, are called to the festival, so that it may represent to the gods the generations who have been blessed? The last sentence, \u201cwhether burnt by the fire, or not burnt by the fire,\u201d is equally striking. Can this refer to such a bonfire as I have described, and to the leaping over it, which is the constant accompaniment of the ceremonial? \u201cRejoicing in their offering in the midst of heaven\u2014whether burnt or not,\u201d is a very curious phrase, and would seem, on the face of it, to point to some popular ceremony, in which fire was an essential point.\nreligious rite must commence. When this is over the ordinary morning prayers and mantras are repeated, and a special prayer is offered to P\u00fclli\u00e2rsw\u00e2m\u00ee or Gane\u015ba, that he will be pleased to remove all obstacles from the way of the successful accomplishment of the ceremony. It is necessary to say here that no image is used during the whole course of the celebration except that of Gane\u015ba, and this is simply adored because nothing whatever can be expected to go right if he be not propitious. Indra is represented on ordinary occasions as a white man sitting on an elephant. In his left hand is a bow, and in his right a thunderbolt, while his body is studded with a thousand eyes. Agni has also his special image, that of a stout man, red and hairy as Esau, riding on a goat. S\u00fbrya is also a red man sitting on a water-lily. He has four arms and three eyes. But none of these are known at Pongol any more than they were at the time when the hymns of the Rig Veda were composed. In fact, we see them here only in the form of the elements. Indra is the rain which fell to cause the rice to spring. S\u00fbrya or Agni, for the two are united, is the sun which ripened the grain. Does not this also point to a time anterior to the modern Hindu pantheon, which first turned the elemental gods into idols, and then very nearly forgot them altogether?\n\nFor some days previously the wife and her assistants have been busy preparing all kinds of sweetmeats, and while the males are at prayers, bathing, and tooth cleaning, the accumulated store of sweets is parcelled out for presents to neighbours, patrons, and colleagues. Every European with whom the Hindu has had the slightest connexion, or from whom there is a possibility of the slightest favour, must be carefully remembered. The gifts are laid out on trays. In the midst is a huge vase of sugar; or, perhaps, the vase gives way to an idol, peacock, or elephant, round which will be grouped smaller works in sugar for the children; then plantains, oranges, and every other fruit in season. One thing may not be forgotten, that is a lime. This must be as large as money can buy, and then be carefully encased in gold leaf, till it looks like one of the golden apples of antiquity. The whole\nare bound, adorned, and crowned by thick wreaths or rather chains, for many of them are a yard and a half long, of chrysanthemums thickly strung on a cord. Oleanders and other flowers are intertwined, but the golden chrysanthemum is the main and essential thing. When all is ready the servants are dressed in their best, and are sent with the trays to the houses of those who are invited to join the family party in the evening, for the Pongol is the great visiting time of the year, and the first day must be wound up by a family party. If the present is for a European or superior, the head of the house, or his grown-up sons, must go with the present. As soon as the present is brought in to the patron, the heaviest of the chains, and it is as long and heavy as the Lord Mayor's badge of office, is taken from the tray and thrown over the neck of the person to be honoured, and smaller chains are given to the children. A few fulsome compliments pass, and then leave to retire is given, and the ceremony is over.\n\nThus the day passes. With evening commences the party (a nautch very probably if the entertainer be rich). It is not within my purpose to describe details of etiquette and ordinary social life, and I therefore pass on, only stating that each evening of the feast there is an entertainment given, first by one and then another, of each group of friends.\n\nNext day is Mah\u00e2 (or Great) Pongol. It is also often called S\u00fbrya Pongol. At noon the sun will cross the equator, and bring the culminating glory of the feast. So great a day must commence with appropriate ceremonial, and in this instance it is bathing.\n\nIn country places the women run early in the morning to the nearest sacred tank and plunge bodily in without undressing. Usually the women are very particular not to wet their clothes, and an innovation so uncomfortable, and possibly dangerous, could not have been borne without good cause. The men also bathe very carefully, as if the occasion were very solemn. We have the reason in Rig Veda, i. 23, 15\u201324 (Wilson, vol. i. pp. 57, 58), \"Verily he (Agni) has brought to me successively the six (seasons) connected with the drops (of\nthe Soma juice) as (a husbandman) repeatedly ploughs (the earth) for barley. Mothers to us, who are desirous of sacrificing, the kindred (waters) flow by the paths (of sacrifice), qualifying the milk (of kine) with sweetness. May these waters which are contiguous to the Sun, and those with which the Sun is associated, be propitious to our rite! I invoke the divine waters in which our cattle drink; offer oblations to the flowing (streams). Ambrosia is in the waters, in the waters are medicinal herbs; therefore, divine (priests), be prompt in their praise. . . . Waters, take away whatever sin has been (found) in me, whether I have (knowingly) done wrong, or have pronounced imprecations (against holy men), or (have spoken) untruth. I have this day entered into the waters: we have mingled with thy essence: Agni, abiding in the waters, approach and fill me, thus (bathed), with vigour. Agni, confer on me vigour, progeny, and life, so that the gods may know the (sacrifice) of this my (employer), and Indra with the Rishis may know it.\u201d If this passage refer to the custom described above, and the resemblance is so strong that the coincidence can hardly be accidental, we learn that the bathing is at once a part of the worship of Agni and a means of that inward cleansing without which gods, like those of Vedic times, could not be propitiated. The worshipper must himself be pure. The passage also explains why the women have a portion in the Pongol ceremonial. We shall find shortly that the remaining work of woman in the tasks of the day is just that described in the verse beginning \u201cMothers to us.\u201d\n\nDripping wet, the women proceed, without changing their clothes, to prepare the feast. It must be remembered that we are speaking of the very coldest time of the year, when wet clothes are a most serious inconvenience. It has been said that new chatties, or earthen vessels, had been purchased for the occasion. One of these is now taken and is filled with rice, milk, sugar, dhol, ghee or clarified butter, gram, and other substances, calculated to produce a tasty dish. This is the work of the \u201cmother to us,\u201d and her object is \u201cto qualify the milk (and rice) with sweetness.\u201d The Pongol\ndish of rice is as important a test of housewifely skill in the Madras Presidency as the Christmas plum-pudding in English homes. New rice must alone be used\u2014in fact care should be taken that every constituent of the mess is the produce of the season just closed\u2014the ingathering must be celebrated with things that have just been garnered. (Usually Hindus will not eat new rice, as it is indigestible, bearing the same resemblance to rice that has been kept twelve months as a waxy new potato bears to its well kept-senior.)\u00b9 Meanwhile, as soon as the morning meal is finished, the men set up a fireplace in the yard of the house. This is no difficult matter, as nothing is required beyond a few bricks or stones and a little mud. Fancy a dozen horse-shoes, a foot across, placed one upon another and the top one bearing three or four knobs, so that the circular bottom of the pot shall not absolutely close the upper opening. Imagine this pile made of clay, strengthened and bounded by a few brickbats, and we shall have a pretty good idea of an Indian fireplace, such as is employed for all purposes of cooking, even in the kitchens of the best European houses. Such, at all events, is the contrivance used at Pongol. It is erected in the centre of the court, and open to the sun and sky. Here also we obtain a token of primitive origin, for usually, indeed we may almost say invariably, the Pauranic ceremonies are done within doors. In most respectable houses there is a small room set apart for such things. In it is the household god before which the master of the house performs his worship. In this room the family priest performs his rites, and instructs the growing lads in their religious duties. But then these household gods are Pauranic, while Indra, Agni, and S\u00fbrya are Vedic. The latter worship, and apparently all the more important portions of\n\n\u00b9 Not only is it necessary to eat the new rice now, but the recent crop may not be tasted till now, however poor or stinted the owner may be. The first fruits must go to God, and the bulk of the crop may not be used till the claims of the deity have been duly satisfied. In this point the feast shows the closest likeness to the Jewish celebration\u2014Leviticus, chapter xxiii., verses 10\u201314, \u201cWhen ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest. . . And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the self-same day that ye have brought an offering unto your God.\u201d\nthe worship of Agni, were chiefly in the open air. The sun, rain, and wind have ripened the crops and caused the rejoicing of the Harvest Home, and surely the thanksgiving should be in the face of sun, rain, and wind, so that Indra and his fellows may see and help the ceremony, accepting the praise it is meant to show. (The circumstances of the case have been powerful in aiding the conservatism which leads the Hindu to oppose every innovation, and hence the scene of the ceremony has continued unaltered in spite of centuries of opposition.)\n\nWhen the fireplace is finished, attention must again be given to P\u00fclli\u00e4rsw\u00e2m\u00ee. The approaching operation is the most important of the feast, indeed we may say of the year, while the month in which the feast falls is the most unlucky of all. Every day produces evil unless sufficient precaution is taken and suitable oblations offered to the gods. If this be so it behoves all good Hindus to be particularly careful now. So the women, who have to perform most of the ceremonies belonging to Ganesa, because no one has yet been found willing to marry a deity so hideous in outward shape, prepare a great ball of cowdung, which is supposed to represent faithfully a being whose elephant\u2019s head and huge stomach render him beyond the power of being improved or made presentable. This ball is then set upon a stone in the yard opposite to the fireplace. The surrounding area is carefully swept and watered. Then the orange-coloured flowers of the citron are taken in considerable quantity and the largest is stuck into the top of the ball. A woman now brings a small pot of rice flour, takes a pinch between her thumb and forefinger, and then proceeds to drop the flour on the ground in a regular geometric pattern. The flour is not sprinkled, but laid on the ground in a true, fine, continuous line. Wonderful skill is often exhibited in the drawing, if such it may be called when nothing touches the ground but the dropping powder, and the patterns are very complex. Yet there is in almost every house one or more women who will run through the whole figure without hesitation or mistake. A store of cowdung is nigh, and the remainder of the citron\nflowers. Of the former she makes a number of small balls about twice the size of a marble. In each ball she sticks a citron flower, and then deposits one at every point in the drawing where the lines intersect. Lastly some oil is poured over the larger lump that represents the god, and then all is complete. I should say here that every day during the month a similar drawing, adorned with its tiny balls crowned with the golden citron, is made on the ground in front of the house door. This is done so that \u015aiva, the destroyer, to whom the month is dedicated, may not be able to enter the house without having been appeased by the propitiated Gane\u015ba. Each day a fresh drawing is made, and new balls adorn it; but those used on former days are not forgotten. They are collected carefully each day, and preserved until the last day of the month, when they are all placed in a basket and carried by the women of the house to the nearest tank, into which they are thrown, carrying with them the ill-luck of the month, and permitting the incoming month to be free from fear or sorrow.\n\nWhen 'all is complete, the head of the house approaches the image and performs p\u016bj\u0101 in this way:\u2014Standing in front of the idol, just beyond the drawing, he folds his arms across his breast, laying the right hand on the left shoulder and the left hand upon the right shoulder. He then bows his head and seizes each ear by the hand that rests upon the shoulder nearest it, saying the while a mantra, which consists almost entirely of the words \"Oh Vighn\u0113\u015bvara, Oh Ganapati, Oh Pillaiy\u0101r, help us this day. Avert all obstacles and help us.\" This he repeats three times as he bows lower and lower, till he is in danger of falling. Thus propitiated, there need be no further fear from Gane\u015ba.\n\nYet a third work has occupied the morning, for all are busy. This is purely a work of mercy. Those who know aught of India are aware that the lot of a young married woman is by no means enviable. She knows nothing of her husband, and dare not speak to him save at night. She is delivered over, body and soul, to the mercies of her mother-in-law; and the tender mercies of Hindu mothers-in-law are\ncruel. The young wife, she is but a girl, must bear revilings and even beatings at the hand of her tyrant, and has no appeal. She must hew wood, pound rice, and fetch water. She must always be at the beck and call of her husband's mother and may never complain. A gentle girl under a shrewish mother-in-law endures martyrdom every day of her life. Not a week passes in any considerable town, but some young wife drowns herself in well or tank to rid herself of her tormentor. There is no redress even then, for when the coroner holds his inquest, there are always a score of old women to swear that she had complained of \"belly-pain,\" and had threatened to destroy herself in consequence. No coroner's jury can ease or redress the \"heart-pain\" that led to suicide. All this is well known, and when the joy of Pongol comes, mothers' hearts turn to their despised daughters, and try to devise some means of pleasing the she-tyrant. So a present, the best the house can provide, is carefully put together on a tray. It may be fruit, or brass pots, or ghee, or whatever else may be thought most acceptable. Then a small procession is formed. In front go three or four men beating tom-toms and blowing pipes. Then follows the gift held aloft. Over it, if the family be respectable, is held an umbrella, carried by a servant who walks behind the bearer of the gift. Next comes a tiny crowd of friends\u2014brothers, uncles, etc.\u2014numerous in proportion to the position or ferocity of the dame who is to be propitiated. Arrived at the house, the present is offered and accepted. Then the nearest relation present steps forward and asks that the daughter and her husband may come to the \"boiling,\" to fill up the family circle.\n\nAll this is done betimes, and then all gather in the court. The time of the passage is near, when the pot is placed in position. Beneath it is a store of wood. Around it are heaped as many bratties (cakes of dried cow-dung used as fuel) as will stand. At the proper moment fire is applied, and a curl of smoke tells that the \"boiling\" has commenced, and that the sun has made the passage. From this portion of the ceremony, the festival is known in Mysore as the\n\"Sankr\u00e2nti,\" from the Sanskrit word for a \"passage.\" Now every eye is fixed upon the pot. Crowded round it is the whole of the household, from the hoary grandsire to the child just able to walk. Even the infants are there in their mothers' arms, for women have as much place in the Pongol as the men. In front and nearest the pot ought to be the elders of the house, but the habitual reverence paid to age is for the nonce forgotten, and the boys have pushed through, and form the front rank. The house-mother trims the fire and maintains a glorious blaze. As the milk boils, so will the coming year be. Should the process be rapid, prosperity and peace will fill the house till Pongol comes again. Should the fire burn slowly, and the milk lie sullenly in the vessel, clouds of sorrow, shafts of destruction from the great Indra, lord of the lightning and rain, will overwhelm the family. As the fire burns down, for the pot is large, a little ghee will be thrown on the fire, at once an offering to Agni and the means of more rapid boiling.\n\nIn the presence and activity of the women, we again see tokens of primitive origin. There is no doubt that in the Vedic period, the women had a special share in the worship of Agni. Compare, for instance, Rig Veda, i. 14, 7 (Wilson, vol. i. p. 35), \"Agni, make those objects of veneration, augmenters of pious acts (participant of the offering), together with their wives. Give them, bright-tongued, to drink of the Soma juice.\"\n\nAgain, Rig Veda, i. 72, 5 (Wilson, vol. i. p. 191), we read, \"The gods discovering thee (Agni) sat down, and with their wives paid reverential adoration to thee upon their knees.\" The same S\u00fbkta also contains an allusion, in verse 8, to the fact that Agni was esteemed as the deity who had given milk to mankind\u2014\"For thee (Agni) Saram\u00e1 discovered the abundant milk of the kine with which man, the progeny of Manu, still is nourished.\"\n\nAs the fire burns up, and it is clear that before long the milk will boil, the men-folk standing round mutter mantras or prayers, almost in the very words\u2014they cannot give them exactly, as the Vedas are a sealed book to all but Brahmans\u2014\nwhich so touchingly close the last two and other S\u00fbktas of the second Ash\u1e6daka. \"Grant, Agni, to the offerer of the oblation, the earth, the bestower of cattle, the means of many (pious rites), such that it may be perpetual: may there be to us sons and grandsons born in our race, and may thy goodwill be ever upon us.\" Now every neck is bent, for the surface of the milk is disturbed. One bubble, and then another, rises to the top. Dead silence prevails\u2014a terror of waiting thrills the assembly. Then, with a heave, a hiss, and a surge of bubbles, the seething milk mounts to the top of the vessel. Before it has had time to run down the blackened sides, the air resounds with the sudden joyous cry of \"Pongol, Oh Pongol, S\u00fbrya, S\u00fbrya, Oh Pongol!\" The word Pongol means \"boiling,\" from the Tamil word Pongu, to boil; so that the joyous shout is, \"It boils, Oh S\u00fbrya, it boils, it boils!\" In a moment a convulsion of greetings animates the assembly. Every one seizes his neighbour and asks, \"Has it boiled?\" Both faces gleam with delight as the answer comes\u2014\"It has boiled.\" Then both shout at the top of their voices\u2014\"Oh Pongol, Pongol, Oh S\u00fbrya, Oh Indra, Pongol, Pongol!\" It is thus that the tiny boy greets his grandsire, and the father hails his son. The festival is fortunate. The great gods, through whose mercy the next and all succeeding harvests alone may come, have accepted the thank-offering. Indra is propitious. The heavy clouds shall come, gravid with rain, when the next season shall come. Seed-time and harvest shall not fail. The garners shall still be crammed with grain, the udders swell with milk for the sustenance of man. Agni, S\u00fbrya, Mitra\u2014for it matters not by which name the god shall be called\u2014will still shine upon the earth, drying up the waters when the grain comes into the ear, gilding and ripening the bending shocks, and making the whole earth laugh for very gladness. The time of fear has gone. Magha can no longer hurt. The king of the gods is satisfied, why should men tremble for the rest?\n\nWhen the excitement has somewhat subsided, the pot is lifted from the fire and placed before the image of Ga\u1e47e\u015ba, through whose grace no obstacle has prevented the boiling.\nAs soon as the mess is a little cooled, a portion is taken out of the pot and placed in a leaf platter before the god, who is asked to eat of it. When time has been given, and no movement is made, the share of the deity is taken away and given to the cow. Meanwhile, the second courtyard has been swept and prepared for the feast. In the centre is a huge dish, if such it may be called, when it consists only of some scores of leaves sewn together. Round the circumference of a circle, of which the dish is the centre, are set as many plates (sewn leaves) as there are persons in the house, counting women, servants, visitors, and relations. Then the pot is carried in, followed by the trooping guests. As soon as the vessel is emptied on the dish, each reaches his hand and crowns his platter with enough of the savoury and steamy food. When all are served, a moment's silence ensues, and then the master of the house lifts his plate in both his hands above his head. The guests do the same, and then all shout together, \"S\u00fbrya, S\u00fbrya, Oh S\u00fbrya, we offer this to thee. Eat thou, Oh god, the food we offer. Thou didst give to us.\" This done, the plates are again laid on the ground, and the meal commences. In five minutes the platters are clean and the meal is done. The dish, with as much rice as remains, is then taken outside, and either given to the cows or bestowed upon the mendicants, whose golden season is passing swiftly from them.\n\nSuch is the festival of the Pongol or boiling, and such it has been for thousands of years perhaps. Is not its mere description sufficient to mark it as altogether different from every Pauranic celebration? Does it not bring back to us something of what the Jewish feast of ingathering was in the times of Hebrew glory? I have not been able to trace many actual notices of the feast from such Vedic literature as is at my disposal, but there are many points in the narration which cannot be other than primitive, so contrary are they to modern Brahmanism, and so consonant with what we know to have been the custom of the Aryan race. First, with regard to the glad shout which hails the boiling, may we not see something like it in the last verse of Rig Veda, i. 141 (Wilson, vol. ii. p. 71), where we read\u2014\n\"Agni, possessing eminent (fitness) for supreme sovereignty, has been glorified by us with holy rites and with hymns. Let all who are present, as well as we ourselves, enriched (by his favour), shout aloud (the praise of Agni) as (loudly as) the sun (causes) the rain cloud (to thunder).\" This passage exhibits the worship and praise of Agni as being performed by visitors and servants\u2014\"Let all who are present, as well as ourselves.\" It exhibits them as joining in the shout of praise. The \"enriching by his favour\" is the harvest, the \"renovation of all that is eaten.\" We have seen the holy rites\u2014the hymns alone are missing. How remarkable is the common feast at which women and servants\u2014men of inferior caste\u2014may sit and eat! Does not this remind us of a time when, bound by a common danger, fighting a common enemy, and looking for a common good, the race was one differing in wealth and position, but not in blood or caste? At other times the wife may only eat her husband's leavings; the servant may not touch his master's food, or be seen eating his own. Now all sit at one repast. There is no question of superior or inferior. God has blessed them all alike with food. The rain descended, and the sun shone on the evil and on the good. There are, it is true, unholy rites among the Brahmans, where, under cover of the night, deeds are done that set at nought all laws of caste, religion, or the plainest morality. But these are modern. They are hidden in darkness, and their very perpetrators are ashamed to have their doings known even to their co-religionists. But the Pongol is domestic. It is open to the day. It is old, and opposed to every tenet of their religion as popularly taught. The levelling of distinctions of sex and caste is for a good purpose, and based on a fact of universal importance. The ingathering is as old as the race in India, and there can be little doubt that the feast has come down from primitive times, bearing witness against caste as an innovation, a thing unknown to their early forefathers.\n\nBut again. No Brahmans are present. The master of the house is the leader of the feast. Gifts are made in profusion, but they are to mothers and sons-in-law, to cows,\ncalves, and beggars. The very offering to Pillaiy\u00e2r or G\u00e2ne\u015ba, which at all other times is a perquisite of the priest, is now given to the cows or to the poor. There is a purohita or \"man put forward,\" but he is not a Brahman; he is the master of the house or his eldest son.\n\nThere is no image but that of G\u00e2ne\u015ba. Lapse of time has run Agni and S\u00fbrya into one, but the process is apparent in the Rig Veda. Indra is universally accepted as the presiding deity, but appears to have subsided into the silent king of the gods, and almost every rite is dedicated to the Sun-god, who is, as it were, the active deputy, the functionary who is the sole means of approach to the higher deity. The messenger of the gods can make or mar the message he carries, and it is better to please him than to adore the more dignified but less active members of the Pantheon. Puranism has done something to degrade the ceremony, for while the people know that they must worship Agni, they have forgotten why; and the modern Mercury\u2014G\u00e2ne\u015ba\u2014has been introduced to perform the very work for which Agni was first invoked; to remove obstacles, protect the ceremony, and carry to Swarga (the abode of the gods) the adoration offered. There is, therefore, now a curious duplication of deities, to perform the same duty, in which the gross Pauranic idol has occupied the place of the elemental deity. To put the fact in Indian official language, we may say that G\u00e2ne\u015ba has been appointed averter of obstacles, vice Agni, promoted.\n\nBut we must return to the feast. As soon as the meal is despatched, there is quiet for a time, while exhausted nature recruits itself with a siesta. As soon, however, as the sun has well declined towards the west, every house is again in a bustle; men, women, and children put on their best. This is saying no slight thing, for the store of jewels is the store of wealth. Where banks are unknown, and the remembrance of plundering Mahrattas and Pindarries has not died away, wealth must be kept in small compass. It must not be trusted to the care of others. It is not long ago since every house had its cach\u00e9\u2014a secret recess or pit, or may be some cunningly hidden hole under the wall, or among the roots of the mango\nor palmyra tree. On the eve of great festivals, the night was the scene of soft stealing to these hiding-places, and taking thence the jewels that were to give due honour to the day. When they were put away again, some moonless night was waited for, so that no neighbour or friend might have it within his power to confess, under the tortures of ingeniously cruel marauders, where the prize was secreted. Now, each house has its strong box, well clamped and bound with iron or brass, and guarded by some complex letter-lock, which no illiterate servant can decipher. The box is frequently the couch of its owner, so that it may not be stealthily conveyed away while he sleeps. However that may be, all its treasures are given up now, golden-threaded turbans, heavy bullioned sarees, rings for nose, ears, fingers, wrists, and ankles; chains for the neck; gold plates for the crown of the head, and jewelled rosettes for the forehead; buttons and rosaries of dragon guineas or Australian sovereigns\u2014all are produced and applied to the purpose for which they were designed; and soon the men appear, white and glistening, and the women bowing down almost under the weight of their ornaments. The occasion is a special one, so is the display. The Hindus are not a visiting nation by any means, and they suffer in consequence; for no nation can, with impunity, forget the great fact that mankind is one great family. The isolation which is produced by unsocial habits has been one great cause of the utter helplessness of the nation in the presence of invaders or usurpers. But in the Pongol we again see traces of better times, when, as a pastoral race, the Aryans knew how sweet was sympathy, how strong the tie of hospitality. The Pongol is one long series of visits, entertainments, and social joys. So now, when the air is cool and pleasant, the males of every family\u2014that is the young men\u2014proceed on a round of visits. In every case a present must be given and received. If the village be rural, and manners have not been corrupted by Western innovations, a couple of men with pipe, tom-tom or guitar, precede the party, and give notice of its coming. At Pongol every musician is fully employed, and the discord which fills the streets, while the visits are being paid,\nis ear-rending. The presents are borne by a servant, and consist of new chatties, spices, or other portable articles of value, proportioned to the means of the giver. When two parties meet in the street they halt, and a colloquy ensues after this fashion, \"Has the milk boiled?\" \"It has boiled through God's grace and your favour.\" \"Did the milk bubble soon?\" \"Yes, the deity is propitious, because of your favour.\" After a few more words, they each give the parting benediction\u2014\"May good luck rest on the year for you!\"\u2014and move on to fulfil their errands. At each house the same dialogue takes place. In every house of every street from tongue to tongue flies the same question, solemnly put, \"Has the milk boiled?\" Equally solemn comes the invariable answer, \"It has boiled.\" Even strangers meeting in the street ask and answer the question as they pass, it matters not what their caste. But I have forgotten the main object of the visit, to ask for \"the pleasure of their company\" at the evening's entertainment. With the latter the day closes, and before ten o'clock all respectable folk have retired for the night.\n\nWith earliest dawn on the following morning all are stirring. This, the third day of the feast, is M\u00e2ttu Pongol, or the Pongol of cattle. The slow but hard-working bullock is to have his holiday, though no little teasing, and perhaps torment, is first to give him a relish for his unwonted delights. In what follows we see again a time when cattle were the staff and stay of their masters\u2014when, without their milk and clarified butter, the gods could not be worshipped\u2014when those same things were food and wealth\u2014when without them no journey could be made in safety, no field could be ploughed, no fire could be made, and no corn could be trodden from the ear. So strong is the instinct, that the ceremonial belongs to another life and religion to that they now see in India, that, as far as I am aware, there is no legend at all widely received that attempts to account for the cattle holiday on Pauranic principles.\n\nAs soon as the male population have cleaned their teeth\u2014and the operation is so prolonged and elaborate that\nit deserves to take the highest place in the Hindu toilet\u2014they betake themselves to the nearest sacred tank, driving or dragging with them the whole bovine possessions of the village. Now takes place a general wash. As on the previous days their masters had taken special care to ensure cleanliness of person, so now each cow and bullock must undergo a most searching lavatory process. A wisp of straw serves for the rubbing, and before long every part of the long-suffering animals is as clean as clean can be. Then all are driven home and the adornment commences. First the horns are carefully painted red, blue, green, or yellow. If the owner be rich, gold leaf is employed, or brilliant tinsel. Then heavy garlands of flowers are brought forth and placed on the horns, round the neck, or over the quarters of the patient beast. Meanwhile, the women have prepared another new chatty, filling it with water, and then steeping within some saffron, cotton seeds, and margosa leaves. When the water is yellow and bitter, it is ready. The master of the ceremonial, usually the head of the house, comes for it, and places himself at the head of a procession of all the men\u2014the women may not see the rite we now describe. In solemn silence they march round each animal four times, while the first man sprinkles the bitter water upon it and the ground as often as they pass the four cardinal points of the compass. This done, the pot is placed on the ground, and each male in turn performs to each animal the S\u0101\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45gam or prostration of the eight members of the body. This is the highest possible token of reverence, and receives its name from the mode in which it is performed. The person first falls on his knees, and then, stretching out his arms, he bows to the ground until his forehead touches the soil. At the same moment by bending inwards, he causes his stomach to touch the ground, and thus at that instant, his feet, knees, stomach, forehead, and arms (from the elbow to the fingers), or eight members in all, are as lowly bent as is possible, betokening the greatest depth of humility and reverence. As Dubois very properly says\u2014\"It is used nowhere but in the presence of those to whom an absolute and unlimited deference is due.\"\nThis done, the public\u2014that is, the women and children\u2014are again admitted, and to the juveniles the most exciting ceremony of the feast is commenced. The patient cattle are led out one by one into the street, and there receive their final adornment. Strings of cocoanuts, plantains, bells, or anything else that will swing from neck or horns, are fastened as securely as may be under the circumstances. As will be imagined, the cattle are not very patient under the process, but they are usually very good-tempered and hurt no one. Soon every animal in the village is duly bedizened and discomfited. A moment of silence succeeds, while the villagers look on or wonder among themselves whose son will be most distinguished in the affray that it is to follow. Then, at a given signal, every rope is untied\u2014every tom-tom, pipe or guitar is banged or blown to the extreme of its endurance\u2014every woman screams and every urchin yells, and in an instant the herd\u2014hitherto so patient\u2014is careering down the street in an extremity of terror. But their flight brings new sufferings. The cocoanuts swing at every lurch, and bruise nose and knees, or thunder on the horns. New terrors urge on the crowd, for to every tail is clinging some eager boy, eager to rob the plantains, bells, or nuts. The glory of the day is, that every one who can may possess himself of whatever is carried by the cattle, and boast of his prowess and his spoils. No little skill and a vast amount of courage are shown by the \"timid\" Hindus in this dangerous and exciting pell-mell, and soon peace reigns again, when the oxen have returned to their pristine nudity. Their troubles are over, and a holiday of the best possible character succeeds. The cows may go where they like\u2014into field, garner, or shop. They may eat whatever their souls incline unto, so long as they can get it without help from men. The chetties (shopkeepers) tremble to-day, for many a sly push is given to direct the cattle to the stores of a hard creditor, or usurious grain-dealer, and woe be to the man if he would drive away by stroke or word the marauding bullock.\n\nThe next day is Kanru Pongol, or Pongol of calves. In this the rising herd receive treatment as kind and yet as\ncruel as fell to the lot of their parents on the preceding day. Again the boys gorge themselves with stolen, but well-cared fruit, and again there are a score of hair-breadth escapes from broken limbs or gored bodies.\n\nOn the evening of this day we find the only token of corruption in the ceremonial. In almost all the public festivals it is the custom for the Brahmans to carry the temple idols through the streets, attended by dancing girls, torches, blue lights, Bengal fires, and the dense but good-humoured crowd which the sight is sure to attract. After having thus perambulated the town, the images are carried back to their places and a great portion of the crowd is sure to enter the temples and make those offerings of pice, ghee, and rice, which it is the object of the priest to gain. On the last great night of Pongol, this ceremony is gone through. Both oxen and calves are collected at the end of the town, opposite to the temple, and then, in grand procession, come all the deities of the locality; the reflexion of the lights brightens the sky, as if some house were on fire. The crowd is so dense that locomotion becomes almost impossible, as the procession slowly surges along. At every hundred yards or so, a halt is made, and the dancing girls go through their most admired postures. It is the fashion to call these dances lascivious, and I may not run counter to it; but I have seen many a dance (at Nautch) in procession, and in the hall of some of the most ancient temples, without ever seeing anything that could by any possibility be called indecent. The postures resemble most of all the solemn minuets in which our grandmothers sailed across the floors of the ball-room, and are religious exercises compared with our polkas and waltzes. It is true that the songs are bad enough, but they are no worse than the stories contained in our university text books. Besides, even here the songs have the best of it, for the dancing girls suffer under the infirmity which afflicts almost all our own lady-singers, they cannot give the words of their songs so that they may be understood. Be this as it may, the procession creeps along till it reaches the assembled herd. A long halt is now made, and dances and songs begin afresh. Dubois describes a ceremonial as\noccurring at this time, which I have not seen; as, however, it is interesting, and the Abb\u00e9 is seldom incorrect, I will add the account in his own words (Dubois, 2nd ed., 1862, p. 286).\n\n\"The whole terminates with a piece of diversion, which appears to be waggishness, rather than any part of the ceremony. The numerous rabble who are present form themselves into a ring, and a live hare is let go in the midst of it. Poor puss, finding no outlet by which it can escape, flies to one side and the other, sometimes making a spring over the heads of the throng, which produces incredible mirth in the crowd, till the creature is at length worn-out and caught.\"\u00b9\n\nThe procession now wends its way back to the pagoda, and the outward ceremonial of the Pongol ceases. The whole population rests for three more days, and unlimited hospitality is the rule. Every evening is devoted to visiting, and usually a set of friends arrange that while each gives but one entertainment, the whole enjoy a feast every night. Caste is for the nonce forgotten, but as throughout the year intimate friendship has been limited by caste, and new friendships cannot be made all at once, it is not often that the ordinary rules of caste are absolutely broken. At every visit presents must be given and received, and as they frequently take the form of ornaments moulded in pure sugar, it may be imagined that the children have a fine time of it. On the evening of the last day there is a feast for the girls alone\u2014the only time in the year when their separate existence is remembered. They\n\n\u00b9 M. Sonnerat, who, in his \"Voyage aux Indes Orientales et \u00e0 la Chine\" (Paris, 1782), gives a brief account of the Pongol (vol. i. p. 240), mentions another ceremony in connexion, it would seem, with the one here described. He says\u2014\"Le soir on porte la figure du Dieu, processionnellement dans les campagnes. L'idole est plac\u00e9e sur un cheval de bois, dont les pieds de devant sont lev\u00e9s comme s'il galopait, ceux de derri\u00e8re sont pos\u00e9s sur une table de bois, port\u00e9e par quatre hommes. Ils observent dans la marche d'aller en travers comme un cheval qui se cabre et qui rue; l'idole tient une lance \u00e0 la main, et elle est cens\u00e9e aller \u00e0 la chasse; on tue un animal r\u00e9serv\u00e9 pour cette f\u00eate; il doit \u00eatre quadrup\u00e8de, choisi indiff\u00e9remment depuis le tigre jusqu'au rat. On examine surtout le c\u00f4t\u00e9 qu'il prend, quand on le l\u00e2che, pour en tirer des augures. Ce m\u00eame jour les Brames jettent des sorts pour conna\u00eetre les \u00e9v\u00e9nemens de l'ann\u00e9e suivante. Les animaux et les grains sur lesquels ils tombent, deviendront, disent-ils, tr\u00e8s-rares; si c'est sur les b\u0153ufs et le N\u00e9ly (riz en paille), les b\u0153ufs p\u00e9iront et le n\u00e9ly sera tr\u00e8s-cher; s'ils tombent sur les chevaux et les \u00e9l\u00e9phants, c'est signe de guerre.\" I have made every inquiry regarding the practice described by Sonnerat, but can find no evidence that it is observed now.\nmay not go out, except to pass quickly from one house to another, and look forward with longing indescribable to this their solitary festivity. A picture of a peacock, resplendent with tinsel and colour, is hung up in one of the rooms, and as evening draws on, the girls assemble before it. They bow to the picture in turn, and imitate, as well as they can, the ceremonial adopted by their fathers and brothers in their worship. Sweetmeats are handed round, and if the host be rich, presents of cloth, jewels, bangles, &c., are made to each visitor. Then the house-mother tells some story about the blessings that must fall to an obedient wife; or perhaps the father reads a chapter from the more romantic portions of the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata or R\u00e2m\u00e2yana. The evening winds up with chat as to the husbands each girl would like, or fears to have, and many a stern mother-in-law is dissected and favoured with due maledictions. By nine o\u2019clock all good folks should be in bed, and before that hour the party has broken up.\n\nAs the last visitor enters the door of her home the Pongol ceases. The stern duties of life have been thrown into a week\u2019s arrears. Brahmanical and Pauranic ceremonial take the place of the simple Vedic festivity. Indra, Agni, and S\u00fbrya go out of mind till ingathering comes round again, and Vishnu, \u015aiva, and Krishna are alone adored.\nART.

casada\nOtra vez, \u00e1 menos desta,\nY he tenido otro marido,\nA quien he sido sujet\u00e1;\nEste se llam\u00f3 Uchaichate,\nTan rico de algos y rentas,\nQuanto \u00e1 todos en su tiempo\nSobrepuso su nobleza;\nTuv\u00f3 ganados sin cuento,\nCamellos, vacas, ovejas,\nDat\u00edleras, servidores,\nGrandes campos y dehesas.\nTuv\u00f3 mas este Uchaichate,\nCon la que est\u00e1 en tu

VI.\u2014Essay on the Creed and Customs of the Jangams.\n\nBy Charles P. Brown.\n\nThe various Brahmanical creeds prevailing among those Hindus who worship Vishnu and Siva have been amply illustrated by Colebrooke and other eminent scholars. When I was in England in 1836 the learned H. H. Wilson desired me to ascertain and describe the peculiarities of the Jangams or anti-brahmanical worshippers of Siva, whom he had but slightly noticed in his Essay on Sects, in the seventeenth volume of the Asiatic Researches.\n\nThere are brief notices regarding this sect in the Italian travels of Della Valle, (chap. xxi. Letter 5, of Nov. 1623) also in Buchanan Hamilton\u2019s description of the Mysore, written in 1800, in Colonel Wilks\u2019s Mysore, and in the Abb\u00e9 Dubois. These merely record the stories told by their enemies the Vaishnava brahmans. But wishing to learn their own tale I applied to the religionists themselves and shall record their statements.\n\nOriginally the Hindus in Southern India were partly Jainas, but some worshipped Siva, and a larger number adored the petty village goddesses, who are honoured even to the present day by S\u00fbdras and Pariars.\n\nThe Vaishnava religion was introduced in Southern India about the time when the first crusade in Europe began. A Jaina r\u00e2j\u00e2 embraced it, between the years eleven hundred ten and eleven hundred twenty of the Christian era, changing his name from Betteda Raya to Vishnu Vardhana. The Jangam religion began soon after about the year eleven hundred and sixty.\n\nIt was instituted by Basava, the son of a Saivite brahman, a native of Bagwari in Belgaum, in the Southern Marata country. When he was a boy (the legends state) he refused\nto wear the brahmanical thread; because the rites that confer this mark of initiation require the adoration of the sun, in the manner prescribed in the Vedas. He then fled to Kalyanam, near Banavasi, in the S\u00fbnda country, where the reigning r\u00e2j\u00e2 was Bijdala or Vizzala, a Jaina by creed, whose minister, a brahman, was Basava's maternal uncle and bestowed on him his daughter in marriage. On his decease Basava succeeded him as minister.\n\nHis father being a Saivite was a worshipper of the Lingam, the most ancient idol known among the Hindus: and which may be seen (a large block of marble) in the market-place of most Hindu villages. This symbol is as separate from indecency in the Hindu mind as circumcision is in the Musulman mind. The huge marble image (Sth\u00e2vara lingam) is viewed with dread, and to move it is a crime. Drawings of it may be seen in Buchanan Hamilton's Eastern India, (which Montgomery Martin published as if he himself were the author) in Moor's Pantheon and Coleman's volume: and there are several images in the British Museum, at the India House and elsewhere. To shew his scorn of superstition Basava made images the size of an acorn, and distributed such to his followers, both men and women,\n\n'Hanging a golden stamp about their necks\nPut on with holy prayers.' (Macbeth iv. 3.)\n\nAnd this he called \"Jangama lingam\" as being peripatetic. He called himself and his followers Linga-jangams (not Jangama) or Lingavants: some call them Ling\u00e2yats.\n\nThe adventures of Basava, and his death in A.D. 1168 (coeval with that of Thomas-\u00e0-Becket) are narrated in the Basava Pur\u00e2n: of which I many years ago printed an abridgment in English.\n\nThe learned Richard Payne Knight wrote an elaborate enquiry into the Symbolical language of ancient Art and Mythology: reprinted by an accomplished scholar Mr. H. Barker, in 1836. It is a pity a system so very ingenious should be utterly unknown to learned Hindus.\n\nIn reading their books written in Kannadi and Telugu\nmetre, I soon perceived why the Lingavants are abhorred by those who worship Vishnu and Siva.\n\nThe Brahmanical creed teaches the worship of the sun and fire; of many gods and goddesses: the system of castes: the doctrine of transmigration; the divine origin of Brahmans: their holiness: the terror of their curse; penances, pilgrimages, the sanctity of particular places: the inferiority of the female sex; the laws of consanguinity; the use of holy water; the entire system of feasts and fasts, purity and impurity: of omens; of lucky and unlucky days; the vast importance of funereal ceremonies.\n\nBasava rejected all these as useless delusions: he declared that all holiness consisted in three things \"Guru, Linga, Jangam\"\u2014that is The Guide, the image, and the fellow-religionist.\n\nThe Guide or Confessor may be any man or woman who is in the creed: who whispers the sacred (mantram) spell in the ear of the Jangam or worshipper: and hangs the image on the neck, or binds it on the arm. A guru is forbidden to eat flesh, to chew betel, or touch liquor.\n\nMarriage is held in high honour by orthodox Hindus. But in the South-west provinces the rite is merely nominal: and the woman is always free to take up with any man as soon as she is married\u2014except her husband. This pernicious fashion has been imitated by the Jangams, who began in that neighbourhood: they did this as an open defiance of Brahmanical tenets.\n\nBasava being by birth a Brahman had many friends and followers of that caste: who are called \u00c2r\u00e2dhya, meaning, Reverend. But these would not give up caste, and eat with Pariars. And they continued to wear the sacred thread laid on the shoulder, with the spell called G\u00e2yatr\u00ee. He admitted them as half converts: and they certainly are scorned by other Jangams as being neither one thing nor the other. Yet in the Prabhu Linga L\u00eel\u00e2 (chap. I.) Basava is characterized as an \u00c2r\u00e2dhya. No idolatrous creed is free from discrepancies.\n\nThe brahmanical funerals being performed with fire,\nBasava ordered that burial should be used: very probably imitating the Jews or the Musulmans. And the widows formerly were burnt alive: he allowed them to be buried alive: in either case all Hindus consider the woman a free agent, a voluntary suicide: such a death is always held in honour.\n\nBasava went further, and made an innovation shocking to all Hindus: for he permitted widows to marry again.\n\nTheir literature consists of less than half a dozen volumes: written in Kannadi, and translated into Telugu, Tamil and Marata. The oldest is the Basava Pur\u00e2n, containing about a hundred tales of their gurus, or saints: many stories are miraculous and several are comic parodies on legends in the Bhagavat or R\u00e2m\u00e2y\u00e2n. The language is rather antique: it dates perhaps from A.D. 1400.\n\nThe Chenna Basava Pur\u00e2n is a modernized comic version or imitation of this book.\n\nAlso the Pandit \u00c2r\u00e2dhya Charitra, a voluminous but illiterate record which is their Golden Legend and is very dry reading. There are other smaller poems.\n\nThese books are chiefly read for amusement. In these anecdotes the brahmanical god Siva is often introduced, not as an object of reverence, but as a humble mean servant of the various \"Bhacts\" or Saints who work miracles; usually of a comic description. But there is nothing indecent or obscene.\n\nSome of the anecdotes are parodies of legends held in reverence by brahmans.\n\nThe Prabhu Linga Lil\u00e2 is the most pleasing of these volumes: in which the female sex is treated with respectful delicacy. This book describes the adventures of Allama who is represented as an incarnation of the deity. He becomes visible at the wish of Siva, in Kail\u00e2sa or Olympus. There is no tale of his birth, death, or final disappearance. On one occasion he appears as Anteros, the Amoricide, or Slayer of Lust: and the goddess M\u00e2y\u00e2 (or Delusion) is enamoured of his beauty. Then he disappears and visits a 'bhact' or devotee in a distant town: again vanishes and visits another: he assumes no pomp, has no followers, and manifests no power.\nBasava is a ruler, a warrior, a king's minister, the head of a family, fervent in his vows to nourish Jangams and to vanquish Jainas. But Allama is marked with peace, benignity, humility, and gentleness: he is perpetually sued by various female saints but remains unmarried: he has disciples, but no relations. He has an invulnerable body.\u00b9\n\nPrecisely in this style do Musulman authors write regarding our Lord: and this may account for a Hindu poet's description of Allama: a character so strongly opposed to human nature as seen among Hindus. The Jangam authors strive in vain to account for the name; but it has occurred to me that Basava took it from 'A-la-ma' three mysterious syllables which commence the second sura of the Koran. See the Mishcat-ul-Mus\u00e2bih, Book viii. cap. 1, part 2, on Alif, L\u00e2m, M\u00eem.\n\nOriginating in the South-west of India, in the Kannadi country (which we call Carnatic), the Jangams are widely spread through the Dakhan, the Marata and Gujarati country, also among the Malayalas, Tamils and Telugus. At my request a Jangam poet wrote a Telugu metrical version of the Gospel of St. Luke which has been printed. But a German missionary informs me that he found the Jangams too proud to embrace Christianity: some few appeared willing to be baptized, but soon desisted, on finding that it would not suit the Epicurean liberty which they prize.\n\nIt remains to speak of \"The Four \u00c2r\u00e2dhyas,\" personages of great importance in the creed. These are named Revan \u00c2r\u00e2dhya, Marut \u00c2r\u00e2dhya, Ekor\u00e2ma \u00c2r\u00e2dhya, and Pandit \u00c2r\u00e2dhya. These four appeared in four successive ages, as precursors of Basava. Among Jangams and \u00c2r\u00e2dhyas, at all their celebrations of marriage, birth, initiation, or funerals, four vases of water are solemnly set up in honour of these four: who seem to be like the \"Four Prophets\" (p\u00eer) of the Musulmans, described in p. 287 of the Customs of Musul-\n\n\u00b9 Compare Dens, Theologia Moralis vii. 327 de dotibus corporis gloriosi. And compare the character of Siegfried of the Niebelungen Lied. In Wilson's Essay on Religious Sects of Hindus, article \"Yogis\" in a note he gives a genealogy of the N\u00e2thas: the 8th is Goraksha: the 25th is Allama and the 26th is Prabhu Deva.\nmans, published by Dr. Herklots: or like the 'heft tan,' the 'seven bodies' buried at Shiraz: who are much reverenced. In one point all these saints are alike: that nothing whatever is known about them.\n\nThe Jangams have not always adhered to the rules given by Basava. For, like other Hindus they celebrate the Sivar\u00e2tri feast which Tod, in his R\u00e2jasth\u00e2n, has so fully described. And they imitate their neighbours in making pilgrimages to Sr\u00ee Sailam, K\u00e2lahasti, and some other sacred places. I could easily have added many other particulars, but they might not seem worth perusal. Those who converse with Vaishnava brahmans will hear very rough language regarding the Jangams: but having been acquainted with both parties, and having written a translation of the L\u00eel\u00e2, I consider them quite as good as other Hindus: and the English who have occasion to study Telugu or Kannadi will find agreeable and profitable reading in the volumes written in verse by the Jangams.\nART. VII.\u2014On Malabar, Coromandel, Quilon, etc.\n\nBy C. P. Brown.\n\nThe Arabs and Africans who first visited the west coast of India, came \"Mu-abbar\": \"from beyond\" the sea. In the voyages of Ibn Batuta, translated by Dr. Lee, the country is called Muabbar, without any surmise that this is Malabar. The Syrian Christians who live in Travancore wrote the word \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0631 in Syriac characters \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0631, and it has occurred to me that in careless writing this may have been altered into \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0631 Malabar: a name unknown to the inhabitants; who fancy it is the European name for their country and language. The Eastern shore of India also was visited by men \"from over the sea:\" and the name Malabar has also been wrongly applied to the Eastern coast.\n\nBut the name underwent another change. The Tamils in those lands could not pronounce the \u0621 ain, or the letter B, and Muabbar was softened into 'M\u00e2p\u00eela' the name borne by these descendants of Africans: who are now called Moplas.\n\nThe children borne to these foreigners by Hindu women were in Hindi called \"Do-bhashi,\" or \"two-languaged;\" hence Dobhash, or Dubhash, an interpreter: bilingues is the phrase used by Virgil. This word also was hard to the Tamils, who could pronounce neither D nor Bh. They changed the word (such is my opinion) into To P\u00e2si and hence the name Topass; which was applied afterwards to such persons of the mixed blood.\n\nThe name Maabar is correctly explained in Wright's edition of the English version of Marco Polo's Voyages, (in Bohn's Library, 12mo. p. 395): but in a learned essay translated from Arabic, in Prinsep's Journal of the Asiatic Society (Aug. 1836, p. 458) the coast is called \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0631 M\u00f4nib\u00e2r: which is\nthere misprinted Monembar. The Arabs also called this country \u0628\u064a\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0641\u0644 Bilid ul Falfal, 'the land of pepper' (see Sir Wm. Jones's Description of India, chap. iii. which is in his Works xii. 387). The Hindus call the western r\u0113vu, or coast 'Korchi R\u0113vu,' which we call Cochin: while 'Calicut' is properly Kallee K\u014d\u1e6da; Aulay-polay has been corrupted into Alleppie; and Kollam is modernized into Quilon.\n\nA mile or two north of Madras-town there is a fishing village called Kuru manil \u0915\u0941\u0930\u0941\u092e\u0928\u093f\u0932\u094d or 'Black sand;' the earliest Portuguese sailors pronounced this Coromandel, and called the whole coast by this name: which is unknown to the Hindus. At a later day 'Shozha Mandal' has been assigned, denoting 'the land of the grain called maize:' but that grain is peculiar to no district. Some have proposed the etymon 'Kuru-Mandal,' but the Kuru race were in the north not the south of India.\nART. VIII.\u2014On the Treatment of the Nexus in the Neo-\u00c2ryan Languages of India. By John Beames, B.C.S.\n\nRead February 21, 1870.\n\nIn the following remarks the term \"nexus\" is employed to denote a conjunction of two or more consonants in one word without the intervention of a vowel, as \\(kt\\), \\(dhy\\), \\(rn\\), etc.\n\nI divide the neo-\u00c2ryan languages of India into two classes. The Pr\u00e2krits and P\u00e2li are called the \"languages of the first period;\" Hind\u00ee, Beng\u00e2l\u00ee, \u00dbriy\u00e2, Panj\u00e2b\u00ee, Mar\u00e2th\u00ee, Sindh\u00ee, Gujar\u00e2t\u00ee, are the \"languages of the second period.\"\n\nIn assuming that the languages of the first period are later than Sanskrit, I do not lose sight of the fact that historically they were contemporaneous with it. But I call them \"neo-\u00c2ryan,\" because the majority of their forms exhibit a decadence from some more perfect condition. It is true that not only in classical, but even in Vedic, Sanskrit forms are found which exhibit a perfect Pr\u00e2krit type; but this does not prevent the general run of Pr\u00e2krit from showing unmistakable signs of having degenerated from a purer and stronger ancient language, which we cannot call Sanskrit, because it is older still than even the language of the Vedas, and which therefore may, when necessary, be called \"Old \u00c2ryan.\"\u00b9\n\nIt is a highly probable theory that the Old \u00c2ryan, like all other languages, began to be modified in the mouths of the people as early as the Vedic period, and that the Brahmins, at a subsequent date, in order to prevent the further\n\n\u00b9 Es kann aber die Sprache wiederum, je h\u00f6her ins Alterthum aufgestiegen wird, als Dialect oder gar Mundart einer fr\u00fcheren, weiter zur\u00fcckliegenden erscheinen. Grimm, Gesch. d. Deutschen Sprache, p. 574 [827].\ndegeneration of their language, polished, elaborated, and stiffened it into the classical Sanskrit. We cannot, however, suppose that they brought any new material into the language, but simply that they reduced to rule what was till then vague and irregular, that they extended to the whole of the language euphonic laws which had been till then only of partial application, and so forth; all the while, however, only working upon already existing materials.\n\nIt will, therefore, not militate against the established contemporaneous existence of learned Sanskrit and popular Pr\u00e2krit, to consider the former as in general the representative of the original Old \u00c2ryan, and, consequently, as so far older than the Pr\u00e2krit; because, ex hypothesi, in Sanskrit most of what existed in Old \u00c2ryan has not only been preserved, but worked up and expanded, while in Pr\u00e2krit, on the contrary, not only has much been absolutely lost, but that which remains has been corrupted and debased. Besides, as nothing whatever of the Old \u00c2ryan has been preserved, or is likely to be discovered (although much may be, and has been, guessed at from analogy), we are driven, whether we like it or no, to look to Sanskrit for the oldest extant forms; and we do, undoubtedly, find them there, as contrasted with Pr\u00e2krit and P\u00e2li. In the following remarks, therefore, which make no pretence to rise to the level of the higher philology, I take Sanskrit as my starting-point, and place the Pr\u00e2kritis and P\u00e2li on the first downward step, or, in other words, in the first period of Neo-\u00c2ryanism.\n\nWith regard to the languages of the second period, it must be explained that I do not intend to touch on the obscure question of how far non-\u00c2ryan elements enter into their composition. Much there is which is still doubtful, but this is admitted on all hands, that a very large proportion of their constituent parts is of \u00c2ryan origin, and to that the present notes will be confined.\n\nIt has been customary with some writers to derive all the \u00c2ryan words of the languages of this period from the Sanskrit through Pr\u00e2krit; but on a closer survey, I think it will be seen that this idea is erroneous.\nThe languages of the first period have been studied, and the laws of their formation analyzed, and written down. Knowing this much, therefore, we can see that in the second period there are two grand classes of words, one of which has evidently been derived through the medium of Pr\u00e2krit, the other not. It often happens that a Sanskrit word, for instance, re-appears in Hindi under two forms, one of which shows signs of having been in existence in the Pr\u00e2krit period; while the other, by retaining consonants which have been lost in Pr\u00e2krit, shows that it cannot have reached its present position through that language. As a general example, the word \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903 \u201ca house,\u201d may be given. This word in the first period becomes \u0917\u093f\u0939\u0903 and \u0917\u0947\u0939\u0903, with total loss of the cerebral semi-vowel. In the second period, however, the word appears as \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903 and \u092f\u0939\u0903. The \u0930 could not here re-appear unless recourse had been had to the ancient Sanskrit fountains; and this opens the way to a theory which will account for the occurrence in the second period of words far better preserved than they are in the first. I conjecture that in the revival of Brahmanism which followed the expulsion from India of the Buddhists, efforts were made by the Brahmins to re-establish in the mouth of the people, in their pure Sanskrit form, words which they had long been familiar with in their corrupted Pr\u00e2krit shape. It would be thought advisable to discountenance the use of words deeply impregnated with Buddhistic associations, the more so as Buddha had made the vernacular of his native province into a sacred language in opposition to Sanskrit. This practise of resuscitating words having once begun, has lasted down to our own times.\n\nWe find, therefore, three classes of words in the languages of the second period,\u2014First,\u2014Words which existed in Pr\u00e2krit, and passed from and through it into the modern languages.\n\n1 Chand. Prithir. 23.20. One MS. reads \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0903; another \u092f\u0939\u0903; the whole passage is \u0906\u092f\u094b \u091a\u0948\u0924 \u0938\u0941\u0939\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0940\u0964 \u0917\u0943\u0939 \u0917\u0943\u0939 \u092d\u092f\u094b \u0905\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0903\u0965 \u201cPleasant thoughts came\u2014in every house was joy.\u201d\nSecond,\u2014Words which have not passed through Pr\u00e2krit processes at all, but came direct from Sanskrit, at the commencement of the second period.\n\nThird,\u2014Words imported at later dates from Sanskrit, chiefly by pedants, and which have therefore an artificial character and appearance.\n\nIn an investigation like this, which is still in its infancy, it would be, however, premature to lay down absolutely a date for the origin of the second period. We hold two ends of a chain, the centre of which is hid from us. We have at one end Sanskrit, the Pr\u00e2krits, and P\u00e2li, all languages of an inflectional character; by degrees we lose sight of them and several centuries of absolute darkness follow, and when light dawns again we find a mass of local tongues all more or less analytical in their type. When or how the change took place we cannot find out from any literary monuments. A long and patient inquiry may, however, hope at length to bridge over the chasm. The first step in such an inquiry is the analysis of the forms of stem words; that of grammatical forms is the second. The treatment of the nexus affords the most solid and important results to begin with; and it is to this point that I wish to contribute a few observations.\n\nThree kinds of nexus may be distinguished in Sanskrit.\n\nI. The strong nexus, i.e. the combination of two or more strong letters, e.g. \u0915\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091b, \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u094d\u0935\u093f, \u0938\u092e\u0928\u094d, \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926\u094d.\n\nII. The mixed nexus, i.e. the combination of a strong with a weak letter, e.g. \u092e\u093e\u091a\u093e, \u0935\u093e\u092f, \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d, \u0916\u093e\u0918.\n\nIII. The weak nexus, i.e. the combination of two or more weak letters, e.g. \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d, \u0917\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927, \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f, \u0905\u0928\u094d\u092f.\n\nThe strong letters, it should be understood, are the letters of each of the five vargas, with the exception of the nasals; the weak letters are all the rest, viz., nasals, sibilants, semi-vowels, and the aspirate \u0939.\n\nThese three kinds of nexus differ from each other in their method of treatment, in both periods, in the manner which I now proceed to show.\n\u00a7 I.\u2014The Strong Nexus.\n\nA. In the First Period.\n\nThe treatment of the strong nexus is uniform and invariable throughout the first period. The rule, though variously stated by different writers, from Vararuchi downwards, is substantially the same; to wit, that the first member of the nexus is assimilated to the second: e.g. \u0915\u0943kt becomes \u091att.\\(^1\\) The strong nexus is of rarer occurrence than the others, because it is limited by the euphonic laws of Sanskrit, which prohibit the combination of a media with a tenuis, or the placing of an aspirated letter as the first member in the composition.\n\nVararuchi in his third chapter gives a string of rules, arranged without much reference to the character of the nexus, but from which the following general view may be deduced:\n\n\u0915, \u0917, \u0922, \u0924, \u0926, \u092a, are elided before another consonant and the second letter is doubled. This is rather a round-about way of putting it, and he omits all mention of \u091a, \u091c, \u091f, and \u092c. In Pr\u00e2krit \u092c is identical with \u0935, and the rules given for \u0935 therefore apply; \u0935 in iii. 3 is elided (or, as we should say, assimilated), whether it be the former or latter member of a nexus, and \u0935 consequently does the same; thus, Skr. \u0932\u0941\u092d\u0915 lubdhaka = Pr. \u0932\u094b\u0921\u094d\u0939\u094b loddhao, and Skr. \u092a\u0915\u0935 pakwa = Pr. \u092a\u093f\u0915\u092e pikam; Skr. \u0932\u0941\u092d lubdha = Pr. \u0932\u0941\u0921\u094d\u0939\u094b luddho.\u2014Var. iii. 51.\n\nAs to \u091f it so seldom occurs as the first member of a nexus (except in combinations where \u0937\u0937\u094d \u201csix,\u201d constr. \u0937\u0937\u094d forms the first element), that Vararuchi probably thought it useless to mention it. Similarly I am not aware of any cases where the palatals form the first member of a nexus. By Sandhi they would migrate into gutturals in composi-\n\n\\(^1\\) In virtue of this rule, we find in Pr\u00e2krit that when the second member of a nexus is an aspirate, the first member is changed into the homogeneous lenis; thus, \u0915\u0943kth = \u0924\u094d\u092ftth, not \u0936\u094d\u092f, which would be an impossible nexus.\ntion; e.g. \u0924\u094d\u0935\u091a\u094d\u091a twach + \u0926\u094b\u0937\u093f\u0928 doshin = \u0924\u094d\u0935\u0917\u0926\u094b\u0937\u093f\u0928 twagdoshin,\n\u0935\u093e\u091a v\u0101ch + \u092f ya = \u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u092f v\u0101kya. So that probably no instances exist of palatals as initials in a nexus. Vararuchi\u2019s examples are: \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924 = \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f, \u0938\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0915 = \u0938\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0915\u0940, \u092e\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0927 = \u092e\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0940, \u0938\u093f\u0917\u0927 = \u0938\u093f\u0917\u0927\u0940, \u0916\u0921\u093c = \u0916\u0921\u093c\u0940, \u092a\u0921\u093c = \u092a\u0921\u093c\u0940, \u0909\u092a\u0932 = \u0909\u092a\u0932, etc.\n\nLassen, p. 239, repeats Vararuchi for the most part, but shows some consciousness of the difference between a strong and a weak nexus. He gives (p. 235) five classes of nexus, among which is No. II., \u201cComplexus consonantium quaternarum ordinatarum,\u201d which corresponds to my \u201cstrong nexus.\u201d His list of examples is different from Vararuchi\u2019s, but does not add anything to the general rule already obtained from the Indian author.\n\nHoefer, de dialecto Prakrit\u00e2, p. 90, \u00a7 73 b, gives a list of words in which the Sanskrit form of the nexus is retained in Pr\u00e2krit, but this list has no value, as it rests upon incorrect readings. The principal instance is \u0938\u092e\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0915\u0941\u0938 in Vikramorva\u015bi, 110, 2 (edition Calcutta), which Lassen concludes to have arisen \u201cob negligentiam editorum,\u201d or, perhaps, rather from the proclivity of the scribe towards Sanskrit forms, a fertile source of bad readings in the plays. We should undoubtedly read \u0938\u092e\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0915\u0943. Hoefer\u2019s work does not appear to be one of much value.\n\nIf now we turn to P\u00e2li and the Pr\u00e2krit of the Jain writings, we find the same principle carried out. Instances from the Dhammapadam and Bhagavat\u00ee (ed. Weber) are, \u092a\u0943\u0925\u0917\u091c\u0928\u0947 = \u092a\u0943\u0925\u0917\u091c\u0928\u0947, \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924 = \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0924, \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0932\u0902 = \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0932\u0902 (or in Bh\u00e2g. \u092a\u094c\u0930\u0941\u0932\u0902\u00b9), \u0938\u092e\u0928 = \u0938\u092e\u0928, \u0938\u092e\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f = \u0938\u092e\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f, \u0916\u0941\u0937 = \u0915\u0941\u0937 (\u0915\u0941\u0937 is probably for \u0915\u0941\u092d\u091c, hence the aspirate).\n\nP\u00e2li seems to have the best claim to be considered as pure M\u00e2gadh\u00ee, and in the Mahawanso, one of the chief works in that language, we find the same rule, e.g. \u0935\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 = \u0935\u0915\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938 = \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938, \u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924 = \u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924. Numerous instances may be\n\n\u00b9 Vide Weber. Ueber ein fragment der Bhagavat\u00ee, aus d. Abh, d. k. A. d. W. Berlin, 1. Theil, p. 405.\ncollected from every page of the Mahawanso, or any other P\u00e2li work. The rule is apparently absolute and without exception, so much so, that any deviations from it may at once be set down as errors of copyists.\n\nThere seems to be no good ground for supposing that the last member of a strong nexus is ever assimilated to the first. The examples given by Hoefer rest chiefly on incorrect readings, as shown by Lassen.\n\nB.

U. and B. \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0924 in both senses.\n\nThe Sanskrit words \u0917\u0943\u0939\u093f\u0923\u0940, \u091a\u0930\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930, \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e, \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f, \u092e\u0942\u0932\u093f\u0915\u093e, \u092a\u0930\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f occur in their original forms in nearly all the languages, but with slight modifications in some. They do not, however, offer much that is noteworthy.\n\nFrom the examples collected above certain laws may be deduced, keeping in mind the distinction already drawn between words which show traces of Pr\u0101krit influence (class 1), and those which do not (class 2).\n\nHindi, in class 1, rejects the first of the two consonants of Pr\u0101krit, and as a compensation lengthens the preceding vowel, e.g. \u0938\u093e\u0924\u094d, \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0917, \u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f, \u0926\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f, \u092e\u094b\u0939\u0917\u0930, \u092d\u093e\u0924\u094d, from \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940, \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0917\u0940, \u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b, etc. At the same time the final short \u0101 is cut off in nearly every instance in substantives, but not, as a rule, in adjectives.\u00b9\n\nIn class 2 the compound consonant of Sanskrit is split up by the insertion of a short \u0101, e.g. \u0916\u0930\u093e\u0917 kharag, \u0938\u092c\u0926 sabad, \u092d\u0917\u0924 bhagat, for \u0916\u0921\u093c khadga, \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926 \u015babda, \u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924 bhakta. In the case of \u0916\u093e\u0902\u0921 kh\u0101nd, the last member of the nexus has been rejected, and the vowel lengthened, as in class 1, but this is merely an exception. In \u0915\u0941\u092c\u0921\u093c\u093e also the last member has disappeared, but in place of the customary compensative lengthening of the vowel we have the well-known Hindi familiar or diminutive particle \u0921\u093c\u093e added, so that we may assume the existence of an intermediate form \u0915\u0941\u092c\u0921\u093c\u093e, which, however, is only found in Panj\u0101b\u012b.\n\nThe series of \"seven\" and its derivatives belongs to\n\n\u00b9 In the case of adjectives the neuter in am appears to have been accepted as the basis of the modern system, just as in the Romance languages the Latin neuter in um has been selected, and results in a termination o. (That this o came from um, and not from the masculine us, is proved by the existence in the earlier stages of the Romance languages of a separate masculine nominative in s, e.g. mals for malus.) The neuter am of Sanskrit modulates in the first instance into o, and in this stage Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b, Sindh\u012b, and Gujar\u0101t\u012b still have it, but in Hindi it has further migrated into \u0101.\nclass 1, in so far as it has everywhere lost its first member \u092a\u0942. This is only natural; a numeral being, next to a pronoun, the most commonly used description of word, and hence not to be changed by authoritative interference, such as I have assumed in the case of class 2.\n\nThe variations may be thus analyzed:\n\n\u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e satta-, in the words 70, 70th.\n\u0938\u093e\u0924 s\u0101t-, in the words, 7, 7th.\n\u0938\u0924\u093e\u0926 sat\u0101d-, in the words 27, 57, 87, 97.\n\u0938\u093e\u092e saim-, in the words 37, 47.\n\u0938\u0924 sat-, in the words 17, 67, 77.\n\nOf these, \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e is simply the assimilated form of the first period, which in the compounds modulates into \u0939\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930, a form which is found even in the first period. This word is noticeable as the solitary instance in Hind\u00ee of a change of the initial \u0938 into \u0939, though in Panj\u00e2b\u00ee the change is so common as to be regular.\n\n\u0938\u093e\u0924 is the regular form of the 1st class, like \u092d\u093e\u0924 and others. In \u0938\u0924\u093e we have rather a curious phenomenon which requires fuller analysis; the words are \u0938\u0924\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0938, \u0938\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0928, \u0938\u0924\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0938\u093f, \u0938\u0924\u093e\u0928\u0935\u093f. In the first period we do not uniformly find the long \u0101, e.g. sattav\u012bsati, 27th, but satt\u0101nave, 97. But there is a remarkable uniformity in all the seven languages of the second period. We find the long \u0101 in all of them for 27; in all but Panj. and S. for 57; in all for 87 and 97.\n\nJudging at first from \u0938\u0924\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0938 only, and the Hind\u00ee chiefly, I thought this abnormal long \u0101 arose from the \u0905 of \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092e amalgamating with the inherent \u0101 of \u0938\u0924\u093e, first from au (saptavin\u015bati) into au (sattau\u015b), and thus, according to the usual Hind\u00ee analogy, into \u0101. But this suggestion broke down in two ways\u20141st. Because the Mar\u00e2th\u00ee has both the long \u0101 and the v in \u0938\u0924\u093e\u0935\u0940\u0938; so also have the Sindh\u00ee and Gujar\u00e2t\u00ee; and 2nd. Because we have the long \u0101 in words where there existed originally no v to coalesce with it into au.\n\nThe opinion I am at present most inclined to is that the presence of the long \u0101 is due to the accent of the Sanskrit.\nSaptan is undoubtedly oxytone, and though I have not been able to find in the dictionaries or other published works any instance in which the accent of saptavin\u1e63ati is given, yet I have no reason to doubt that, as in Greek, the accent remains in the compound word just as it stood on each member when separate. In Greek the rule which forbids us to place an accent further back than the ante-penultima obscures the analogy, but in Sanskrit we have no such restriction, and \"saptavin\u1e63\u0101ti,\" with the major accent on the penultima, and the minor on the pr\u00e6-ante-penultima is quite possible. Assuming this, and seeing that the two last syllables \"ati\" have disappeared, the word would fall into the form of a paroxytone, and the accent on the syllable ta being the only one left, would assume such prominence as to insure its remaining long throughout the ages. I own I was unwilling to admit this possibility of the influence of the accent, and sought for some time for another solution; I was unwilling to admit into the discussion of a question, already sufficiently complicated, the disturbing influence of another unknown quantity in the shape of the Sanskrit accent; but I fear there is no help for it. That a subtle and apparently irregular system of accents haunts and flavours the pronunciation of modern Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed is as evident as in the case of modern Greek. Why do we say k\u00e1h\u00e1n, laying the accent on the first syllable though short? why k\u00e1ho, not kah\u00f3? why a dozen other anomalies? This unwelcome conviction thrusts back my lucubrations on the nexus till the Sanskrit scholars of Europe are kind enough to dig out and impart to us more facts and laws about the accents of that language.\n\nWe next come to the curious form \u0938\u0948\u0902, only found in 37 and 47. In these two sets of numbers we find that all the odd numbers except the first take this form in ain, thus,\n\n| 33. | \u0924\u0948\u0902\u0924\u0940\u0938 | taint\u012bs. |\n|-----|--------|--------|\n| 35. | \u092a\u0948\u0902\u0924\u0940\u0938 | paint\u012bs. |\n| 37. | \u0938\u0948\u0902\u0924\u0940\u0938 | saint\u012bs. |\n| 43. | \u0924\u0948\u0902\u0924\u093e\u0932\u0940\u0938 | taint\u00e1l\u012bs. |\n| 45. | \u092a\u0948\u0902\u0924\u093e\u0932\u0940\u0938 | paint\u00e1l\u012bs. |\n| 47. | \u0938\u0948\u0902\u0924\u093e\u0932\u0940\u0938 | saint\u00e1l\u012bs. |\n\nThe other languages offer only faint indications of simi-\nlarity. P. has \u0938\u0948\u0902\u091a\u0940, B. \u0938\u093e\u0901\u091f\u0940\u0928\u0940\u0917\u094d\u0930, U. \u0938\u0902\u0907\u0924\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0936\u094d, but none of the others. I think it has arisen from a sort of rhyming propensity, sometimes observable in Hindi. From \u0924\u0947\u0902 or \u0924\u0948 the transition to \u0924\u0948 was easy, the insertion of the nasal in season and out of season being a weakness of that language. In the word for 35 they had at first panchatri\u1e41\u015bat, which soon got altered into panchtis; but here they had a strong nexus, \u091a+\u0924. The \u091a therefore dropped out, and the resulting double \u0924 was reduced to a single, and the preceding vowel compensatorily lengthened, so that the form \u092a\u093e\u0902\u0924\u0940\u0938 arose; to make which rhyme with the word for thirty-three would be irresistible. So also the 37, which was probably \u0938\u093e\u0924\u0940\u0938, was dragged into the scheme, and became \u0938\u0948\u0902\u0924\u0940\u0938.\n\nThe only remaining form \u0938\u0924\u093f is found in 17, 67, 77. In 67 the word was originally sapt\u0101\u015ba\u1e63\u1e6dhih, with two accents close to one another, the latter of which, so to speak, kills the former, so that when by the usual Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit process the first member is modified into satta, the second a, being atonic, falls out; and though the first t also falls, yet, as it is in the first syllable of two, the latter of which is accented, no compensatory lengthening can take place.\n\nIn 77 we ought to have \u0938\u0924\u093e, and probably such a form did once exist, but was crushed into sat by the weight of the double tt of hattar so close after it. Only Mar\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b retains a form saty\u0101hattar. Similarly, the form for 17 was originally satt\u0101rah, and is so still in Panj\u0101b\u012b; perhaps some obscure idea of its similarity in sound to sattar, \u201cseventy,\u201d may have operated in the minds of the people to shorten it. For your Hindust\u0101n\u012b is a dreadful jingler: he twists his words into absurd semi-rhymes, as bartan-artan, for bartan, \u201ca plate;\u201d g\u0101ri-w\u0101ri, for g\u0101ri, \u201ca cart;\u201d ult\u0101-pult\u0101, for ult\u0101, \u201creversed,\u201d and so on.\n\n[Here, for the present, I must stop, reserving the analysis of the mixed and weak nexus for a future occasion, as I am obliged to return to India immediately. I hope to be able in a few months to send home the remainder of the argument, together with the rules deducible therefrom.]\nArt. IX.\u2014Some Remarks on the Great Tope at S\u00e2nchi.\n\nBy the Rev. S. Beal.\n\nDr. Fergusson's book on \"Tree and Serpent Worship\" has opened a large field for inquiry and research. After looking through the photographs and lithographed scenes relating to the S\u00e2nchi Topes, two questions naturally suggest themselves, viz.: What was the idea which suggested the peculiar form of the Indian Tope? and, What are the scenes so carefully represented on the rails and gateways at S\u00e2nchi and Amravati?\n\nWith respect to the first question there is no need to say much, as at best we can only speculate where there is no possibility of proof. But it would seem that the symbolism of the Tope is like that of other sacred edifices, viz., to figure out an idea of the world, or the heavens and the earth. R\u00e9musat, in one of the valuable notes found in the Fo-koue-ki (p. 92), has observed: \"St\u00fbpas are not erected on the tombs of religious persons or laymen, but only simple stones, which by their form symbolize the five elements, viz.: ether, wind, fire, water, and earth; they are called St\u00fbpas by analogy.\n\nTheir figure is this: The lowest portion represents the earth, this is surmounted by the emblem of water; the triangle represents fire, the crescent is wind, and the cone denotes ether. Hence, instead of Chinese characters, it is the custom to inscribe on these several portions of the monument Sanscrit characters indicating the several elements; on the highest the letter \u0915\u0941 to indicate 'ether,' on the second \u0915 to denote 'wind,' on the third \u0930 to denote 'fire,' on the fourth \u0935 to denote 'water' (sc. Varu\u1e47a), and on the lowest the letter \u0905\" [which being the first vowel symbol-\nizes the first element, i.e. earth]. This quotation has been noticed by Dr. Fergusson (p. 106, *Tree and Serpent Worship*), but he simply founded on it a theory for the origin of the Trisul. I would rather see in this record an explanation not only of the earliest religious structures,\\(^1\\) symbolical of the Elemental Universe or Nature, but also of the Tope. The Great S\u00e2nci Tope rests upon a square base or plinth 14 feet high and 121 feet square, round which is a procession path 5 feet 6 inches wide. This portion of the building would therefore symbolize the first element, \"earth.\" Above the square rises a great dome or hemisphere to a height of 39 feet. This dome represents the second element, \"water.\" It would be impossible to place a complete circle of stone on the square plinth, the hemisphere therefore is used to indicate the element.\n\nDr. Muir has observed, that \"when the idea of Varu\u1e47a as the all-embracing Heaven had been established, and on the other hand the observation of the Rivers flowing towards the ends of the earth and to the sea had led to the conjecture that there existed an Ocean inclosing the earth in its bosom, then the way was thoroughly prepared for connecting Varu\u1e47a with the Ocean.\" [Compare the entire account given by Dr. Muir, J.R.A.S. vol. i. part i. N.S. pp. 77, ss.]\n\nAbove the dome, at S\u00e2nci, we have a T\u00f4ran, respecting which I will quote from Hodgson: \"Between the hemisphere and the pyramid is a short square basement for the latter, upon each of the four sides of which a pair of eyes is graved.\\(^2\\) The hemisphere is called the 'garbh,' the basement the 'T\u00f4ran,' and the pyramid the 'Chura-ma\u1e47i' (p. 43, Collected\n\n\\(^1\\) I refer to Logan stones, etc., but principally to those primitive structures called \"Baitulia\" or \"Boetilia.\" I take the rows of stones represented in p. 206 of Sir J. Lubbock's work \"On the Origin of Civilization, etc.,\" to be Boetilia, or \"anointed stones\"\u2014the red mark round the black (which Colonel Forbes Leslie compares to \"spots of blood\") being in fact the \"marks of consecration\" or \"anointing.\" It is well known that \"idols\" or \"josses\" in China are consecrated by a dash of red or vermilion across the eye. With regard to the derivation of the word \"Boetilia\" as signifying \"elemental stones,\" whilst it is generally referred to a Semitic root, I venture to suggest \u092e\u0943\u0924 + \u0917\u0941\u0932\u093e or \u0917\u0941\u0932\u094d\u0932, as denoting that these stones in the first instance represented the \"Elemental World.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) These eyes evidently denote the watchful care of the \"Four Kings\" (Chaturmah\u0101r\u0101jahs) over the affairs of men.\nThe T\u00f4ran is merely a contraction of the Sanscrit T\u00f4ranya or T\u00f4ra\u1e47a [\u0924\u094b\u0930\u0923], \"an ornamented gate or entrance,\" and denotes the entrance or door to the abode of the celestials.\u00b9 [Around Japanese temples are erected gateways called \"T\u00f4ris,\" evidently derived from the same root.] Above the T\u00f4ran rises the pyramid or cone, which Hodgson calls the Chura-mani, [\u091a\u0941\u0930\u092e\u0923\u093f] denoting the element \"fire;\" and above this the mysterious Trisul, combining the two elements of \"air and ether,\" and used by accommodation as the emblem of the \"Highest.\" If these several elemental emblems be thus united, we have the figure of the \"Tope.\"\n\nIn confirmation of this argument, we observe that Mr. B. Hodgson explains the division of the cone which surmounts the \"garbh,\" or \"dome,\" of the Tope, as symbolical of the thirteen heavenly mansions above the sky (p. 43, Collected Essays). But if this be the true explanation, it seems to follow that the lower portion of the Tope must represent the \"lower world.\"\n\nThis opinion is borne out by the use of the word \"ts'a,\" in Chinese, for a Pagoda, or Tope. This symbol represents the Sanscrit \"kshetra,\" a land of Buddha,\" and comprehends the entire chiliocosm, over which S\u00e2kya Tath\u00e2gata is supposed to rule. Now this was the idea of the expanded form of the Tope, from which the Pagoda, in China, is derived; but the expansion of an idea necessarily assumes\n\n\u00b9 Compare the remarks of Mr. Baring-Gould (\"Origin of Religious Beliefs,\" pp. 98, 99): \"The localization of the Deity in heaven gave birth to a number of other names. From the first moment that the consciousness of a God rose upon man's soul, like the morning sun, he lifted his head on high and sought him in the sky. That vast uplifted sphere, now radiant with light, now twinkling with countless stars, attracted the wonder of man, and in it he placed the home of his gods. Heaven was an upper world inhabited by Deities. The Esth supposed it to be a blue Tent, behind which Ukko the Ancient, and the sustainers of Sun, Moon, and Stars and the guardians of the clouds, dwelt in splendour. Men for a long time supposed that the earth was a flat plane, surrounded by the sea, and that the sky was a roof on which the heavenly bodies travel, and from which they are suspended as Lamps. The Polynesians, who thought, like so many other peoples, ancient and modern, that the sky descended at the horizon and inclosed the earth, still call foreigners papalangi, or heaven-bursters, as having broken in from another world outside, 'The sky is to most savages what is called in a South American language mumeseke, that is, the-earth-on-high [compare \"heaven,\" that which is \"heaved up\"]. There are holes or windows through this roof or firmament, where the rain comes through, and if you can climb high enough, you can get through and visit the dwellers above, who live, and talk, and look, very much like people upon earth,'\u201d\nthe germ as a constant, and this germ I take to be the primitive symbolism of which we are speaking.\n\nThis position is strengthened by some indirect considerations; take, for example, the description of the kshetra of the Tath\u00e2gata Padmaprabha, found in Burnouf, *Lotus*, f. 38, b. The kshetra, we must bear in mind, is the Chinese ts\u2019a, and this is the common term for a Pagoda or Tope. Now, the *Lotus* describes the land of Padmaprabha in the same terms as the Chinese accounts represent the \"happy lands\" or \"domains\" of the various Buddhas, \"surrounded by inclosures, and rows of trees covered with flowers and fruits, the whole composed of the seven precious substances;\" but the *Lotus* adds a peculiar item in this description, \"the inclosures are traced in the forms of a square draughtboard\" (\"d\u2019etoffe a carreaux pour jouer aux dames ou aux d\u00e9s,\" *Lotus*, note, p. 363). If we now turn to the 88th plate, fig. 1, *Tree and Serpent Worship*, we see at once that the inclosure of the Amravati Tope was precisely planned according to the description of the inclosure of a kshetra of Buddha. The Lotus-discs, in the plates 48, 49, etc., are precisely the \"asht\u00e2pada\" of the *Lotus*, the discs representing \"draughts\" as they are carved even down to this day in the East. We argue, therefore, that the inclosure at Amravati was designed to represent the inclosure of a Buddha-kshetra, and if so the Tope itself symbolized the kshetra.\n\nThis is illustrated further by *Figs. 1 and 2, Plate xci.*, of the same work. Dr. Fergusson speaks of \"the crowd of umbrellas which crown the Tee in these cases as a curious ebullition of Hindu fancy;\" but I conceive the intention was quite in agreement with the general symbolism of the structure. The single umbrella (chhatra) denoted dominion over \"one world;\" the exaggerated system of worlds, known as a chilio-cosm (of which such repeated mention is made in all the later Buddhist S\u00fbtras), was, therefore, denoted by the \"crowd of umbrellas,\" which we see in *Plate xci*. And the rule of increase will be observed, from the single chhatra to four, (denoting the four cardinal points), and from four to eight\n\n---\n\n1 Translated, we must remember, from Sanscrit.\n(including the half points), and from eight to an indefinite number, agreeing accurately with the actual expansion of belief which occurred (relating to the composition of the Universe) in the History of Buddhism.\\(^1\\)\n\nBut the general argument that religious structures were in the first instance symbolical of the upper and lower world, is strengthened by considering that this was the allowed meaning of the figure and furniture of the Jewish Tabernacle. Josephus and Philo Jud\u00e6us both assert the fact, and it is insisted on by the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Cosmas also, in his Topographia, labours to prove that the Tabernacle in the wilderness was a pattern of the Universe (Yule's Cathay, etc., xlvii). We are told by Porphyry \\((de\\) antro Nympharum\\), that Zoroaster consecrated a natural cell, adorned with flowers, to Mithras, for he thought a cavern to be a fit emblem of the world fabricated by Mithras. Plutarch, in his account of the old Temple of Vesta, says it was constructed of an orbicular form, to shadow out by its shape not so much the world as the Universe \\((de\\) Iside et Osiride, p. 67; Maurice, Indian Antiq., iii. p. 504). And Maurice concludes generally that all circular temples symbolized the Universe (iii. 508). So, again, says Pliny, when speaking of the Pantheon, \"the dome was of a convex form, that it might be the model of the Heavens\" \\((ut fastigiatam c\u00e6li similitudinem ostenderet)\\) [quoted by Maurice, as above]. Such are some general observations in proof of the theory that we may detect the idea of a cosmographic symbolism in all sacred structures, and not the least in the form and developed portions of the Indian Tope.\n\nI proceed to make some reference to the scenes of the sculptures on the gates and beams at S\u00e2nci. But before doing so, I would start the query, whether there is any proof to be gathered from the character of these sculptures, that the followers of Buddha worshipped either the Tree or N\u00e2ga? If they did, nothing in the world would more effectually destroy the theory of their religion. The Buddhist convert, theoretically at least, acknowledged no superior to himself in heaven or earth. The N\u00e2gas were saved from the power\n\n\\(^1\\) This expansion is fully related in all the later S\u00fbtras. Vid. e.gr., Lotus, p. 113.\nof the Garudas by believing in Buddha, and becoming his disciples; and as for Trees, in so far as they were associated with the history of the emancipated Buddha, doubtless, they were \"objects of worship,\" but it was a worship of association, just as the wayfarer bows before the symbol of the Cross, or as the pilgrim, on the first glimpse of the sacred city, flings himself on the earth. We do not worship the building in which we say our prayers; it is a sacred building, just as the Tree in the eyes of the Buddhist was a \"sacred tree,\" but he did not worship it.\\(^1\\)\n\nBut to pass on to some identifications. The scene depicted in Fig. 2, Plate xxxii., is a lithograph taken from one of the sculptured architraves of the Northern Gateway, rear-view; it is not copied from the photograph, but is the only part of the horizontal architraves drawn by Colonel Maisey; the difficulty of getting up to them was so great, that nothing more than this was attempted; it is, however, a very valuable excerpt, and helps to unriddle the entire scene, which occupies both the front and rear face of the beam. Both these scenes embody the history of S\u00e2kya, when he was born as Vessantara. This birth was the one immediately preceding his incarnation as Buddha. It will be necessary to make some reference to this J\u00e2taka, so far as it is related or referred to in works bearing on the subject. Burnouf (Lotus, 411) refers to it in these words: \"C'est dans ce sens que Mah\u00e2n\u00e2ma parle de la derni\u00e8re existence de S\u00e2kyamuni, avant qu'il vint au monde comme fils du roi Suddh\u00f4dana, 'v\u00eassantarattabh\u00e2v\u00ea thit\u00f4,' quand il \u00e9tait dans le corps de V\u00eassantara. On sait en effet que V\u00eassantara est, chez les Buddhistes de Ceylon, le nom d'un personage sous la figure duquel l'\u00e2me de S\u00e2kyamuni parut au monde.\" Again, this J\u00e2taka is referred to by Bigandet (Legend of the Burmese Buddha, p. 83) in these words, \"Without alluding to those great offerings I have made during several previous existences, I will but mention the seven great ones made whilst I lived as Prince Wethandra (Vessantara).\"\n\n\\(^1\\) In cases where the N\u00e2ga, the Horse, the Throne, etc., occupy the place of honour on the Dagoba (as in Plates lxxx., xcI., etc., Tree and Serpent Worship), I should suppose the association to be with the history of Nuchilinda, Kan\u1e6daka, the Vajr\u00e2s\u00e2na, etc.\nAgain, on p. 165 of the same work, we read, \"He then caused a shower of red rain to pour down over the assembled multitudes. . . . This is not, said Buddha, the only time when such a wonder has happened; the same thing once took place when I was Prince Wethandra. He went on relating the most interesting circumstances of that former state of existence.\" Again, in the account of the mission of Song-yun, p. 195 (Travels of Buddhist Pilgrims), we have an allusion to the sacredness of the spot, where Vessantara underwent his self-imposed sufferings. This place, according to Julien, was called Dantal\u00f4ka (Jul. ii. 122). The Prince, both in Song-yun and Julien, is called \"Sudatta,\" but I have identified this personage with Vessantara (Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 194, note), on grounds that will not be disputed. But, finally, the best and fullest account of the Vessantara J\u00e2taka is found in Hardy's Manual, p. 116. It will be necessary, for the purpose of identification, to give a pr\u00e9cis of this relation. \"In former times, in a city called Jayatur\u00e1, reigned a king called Sanda or Sanja; his principal queen was called Phusat\u00ed, and their son was called Wessantara, so named from the street in which his mother was passing at the time of his birth. [Observe the very curious similarity between this name and Wessanagara, the old Besnagar, close to S\u00e2nci; compare Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 90.] From the moment he could speak he gave proof that his disposition was most charitable. [Compare the Chinese Shen-chi, \"the charitable one\" (Song-yun, p. 194).] When arrived at the proper age he married Madr\u00ed-d\u00e9w\u00ed, the daughter of the King of Chetiya. [Compare, again, the singular coincidence in the account of Mah\u00e2n\u00e2ma: \"As\u00f4ka, when sent to be Governor of Ujjeni, tarried at Chaityagiri, and there married Dev\u00ee, the daughter of the chief.\"] They had a son J\u00e1liya, and a daughter Krishn\u00e2jin\u00e1. At this time there was a famine in K\u00e1l\u00eenga from the want of rain; but the king, having heard that Wessantara had a white elephant that had the power to cause rain, sent eight of his Brahmans to request it. Wessantara at once gave it up, on which he was banished from the kingdom to the rock Wanka-giri. His\nwife, Madr\u00ed-d\u00e9w\u00ed, refused to forsake him, on which all their treasures were collected and given away in charity to the mendicants, and they, with their two children, retired into banishment. The nobles then brought a chariot, and Madr\u00ed-d\u00e9w\u00ed, taking her daughter in her arms, and her son by his hand, entered it. Two Brahmans followed them, and requested the gift of the horses that drew the chariot. Without hesitation they were given, but Sekra, observing what was taking place, sent four Dewas under the disguise of horses, that yoked themselves to the chariot and drew it. Again, another Brahman cried, 'Sir, I am old, sick, and wearied, give me your chariot.' The chariot was readily given up. The Prince then carried his son, and the Princess his daughter, and so set off on their journey to Wanka-giri. Wiswakarmma had prepared for them two Pansals (leafy huts). Here they dwelt with their children in the garb of ascetics. At length an aged Brahman, called Jujaka, set out to ask the gift of the two children, as slaves. Wessantara, in the absence of his wife, resolved to give up the children, who had fled away and hid themselves. He went forth and called them back and delivered them to the Brahman. The children, however, seeing the Brahman stumble and fall as he went down the hill, ran away and came back to their father; the father again gave them up, and the Brahman, tying their hands together, drove them along with a stick, beating them as they went. At length, when Madr\u00ed-d\u00e9w\u00ed was about to return home, Sekra sent four Dewas to assume the form of wild beasts, to delay her return. When Sekra perceived that Wessantara had given away the children, he assumed the appearance of an aged Brahman, and went to the rock. Wessantara asked, 'Why have you come?' To which he replied, 'I have come to receive the Princess as my slave.' On this he gave her up also. As the result, both Madr\u00ed-d\u00e9w\u00ed and the children were restored to Wessantara, and all returned safe and sound to Jayatur\u00e1.\"\n\nLet us now compare this account with the sculptures. We read (p. 101, Tree and Serpent Worship), \"the central compartment of this beam has on its right the gateway and\nbuildings of a walled city [Jayat\u016bra]. Inside are numerous spectators, and some figures apparently doing homage to two sacred elephants or their riders. [The two elephants differ from the account in the J\u0101taka, where only one is mentioned.] Near the outside of the gate stands a male personage, wearing the Dhot\u012b and large turban [Vessantara], attended by respectful figures in various attitudes. The Chaori and Chatta which accompany him mark him either as a king or a saint. There are also a number of women with covered jars or vases. [Madri-dev\u012b giving away her treasures.] Next appears a four-horsed chariot of a different shape from those seen elsewhere. It contains a man dressed as above, attended by Chatta and Chaori bearers, and two children with tufts or plumes on their heads. [Madri-dev\u012b and her husband, with their two children.] On the left, another stage of the ceremony is apparently represented. The same chariot is seen unharnessed, the yoke held up by a woman. The two children still occupy it, but the king, or whoever he may be, is standing near the pole with his arm stretched over the yoke, and is apparently conferring some grant or gift to the priest or ascetic before him, into whose hand he is pouring water, an ancient mode of sealing a gift. [Vessantara giving away his horses.] The costume of this last figure is what is usually seen in the only class that can be identified with priests, ascetics, and saints. Above this group, and facing towards the city, is another empty chariot, which a man, dressed as the preceding, is about to harness. [The four Devas sent by Sakra in the shape of horses.]\u201d\n\nThis portion of the scene is tolerably complete. Colonel Maisey refers the plot to the dedication of the chariot to the Sun. Dr. Fergusson regards it as a meeting between Asoka, or some Hindu prince, with the Dasyu chief of the place. It is tolerably plain, however, that the scene represents the first part of the history of Vessantara. Let us now turn to Plate xxxii. Fig. 2, which is a lithograph representing the rear-view of the same architrave. On the extreme right we observe the two Pansals, built by Visvarkarma. Vessantara and Madri-dev\u012b are seen on the left in their social relations, sitting to-\ngether in front of one of the Pansals (in which scene Madr\u012b-\ndev\u012b is probably relating her dream), and also engaged below\nin some domestic pursuits with their fire-pot and chatties. A\nlittle further on the left we see Vessantara sealing the gift\nof his children to the Brahman, by pouring water on his\nhand. Further to the left we see the Brahman beating the\nchildren with a stick because they had run away from him.\n[Compare Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 195.] On the left, again,\nwe see Vessantara giving away his wife to Sakra. In the\nupper division of the scene we observe the beasts sent by\nSakra to delay the return of Madr\u012b-dev\u012b; whilst the Brahm\u0101n\nwith his water vessel, plotting to arrive when Madr\u012b-\ndev\u012b is out, is seen in close contact with the lady; the\npresence of the water vessel in his hand illustrates the\ntext of the J\u0101taka, \u201cWhen the prince saw the Brahman\napproaching, he told his son J\u00e1liya to go and meet him and\ncarry his water vessel.\u201d The scenes on the extreme left re-\npresent the happy termination of the whole adventure, and\nthe restoration of Vessantara, children, wife, and elephant, to\nthe kingdom of Jayatur\u0101.\n\nThere can be no reasonable doubt, I think, that this is the\nreal history of the sculptured scene on this architrave, rear\nand front. It follows, then, and this is an important con-\nsideration, that whatever age is assigned to the gateways of\nthe S\u00e2nci Tope, the same antiquity, and greater, must be\ngranted to the J\u0101taka in point. And if to the J\u0101takas, then\nto all the legendary history of Buddha. This explanation\nalso militates against the theory of a Dasyu element in these\nsculptures. The Dasyus, in fact, are Buddhist mendicants.\n\nI am inclined to refer the scene, Plate xxxvi. Fig. 1, to the\nS\u0101ma J\u0101taka. This fable is given by Spence Hardy (Eastern\nMonachism, p. 275) in these words, \u201cWhen G\u00f3tama Bodhisat\nwas born in a former age as S\u00e1ma, son of the hermit Dukhula,\nhe rendered every assistance to his parents, who had become\nblind when he was sixteen years of age. It happened that as\nhe went one day for water to the river, the king of Benares,\nPiliyaka, entered the forest to hunt, and as S\u00e1ma, after ascend-\ning from the river, was as usual surrounded by deer, the king\nlet fly an arrow which struck S\u00e1ma just as he was placing the vessel to his shoulder. Feeling that he was wounded, . . . he called out, 'Who is it that has shot me?' and when he learned that it was the king, he related his history to the monarch, and said that his greatest grief arose from the thought that his blind parents would now have no one to support them. When the king perceived the intensity of his grief, he promised that he would resign his kingdom, and himself become the slave of his parents. Meantime a Dewi, descending from the Dewa loka, remaining in the air near the king without being visible, entreated him to go to the Pansal, and minister to the wants of the blind parents of S\u00e1ma. He was obedient and went. . . . The body of S\u00e1ma having been brought to the huts, was restored to life by the united Sachikeriyas of the Dewi and the parents. The parents also received their sight, and the Dewi repeating the ten virtues of a king to Piliyaka, enabled him to reign in righteousness, and after death to be born in heaven.\"\n\nIn the Lithograph referred to, we observe the parents of S\u00e1ma seated outside their Pansals. They are evidently blind, for the monkeys are stealing the fruit and playing mischievous tricks close to their persons without interference. In front of their huts is the forest, full of deer. The river flows through it, and we observe S\u00e1ma just coming from the bank and raising the water vessel to his shoulder. The Dev\u00ee (or Deva), standing close to the boy (and probably unseen by him), is introduced to indicate the pious act of the child, and the reverence due to such piety. On the left of the scene is the same boy, wounded by an arrow: his identity with the first figure is shown not only by the likeness and dress, but by the water vessel lying on the bank, evidently fallen from his shoulder at the moment when he was shot. The archers are just above. It does not appear that the king is one of them, but this is not material to the history. In the rear, on the left, we see the king, with his water vessel, ready to resign his kingdom, and become the slave of the blind hermits. The Dev\u00ee is standing close by. Finally, in the left corner, we see the happy termination, the parents\nrestored to sight, and the boy come back to life. This comparison appears also tolerably evident, and tends again to establish two points\u20141. The primitive age of the J\u0101takas; and 2. The style of dress worn by Buddhist hermits, viz., the kilt and a sort of sarang worn over the left shoulder (probably from motives of modesty).\n\nI now pass on to identify some other scenes, beginning with the Northern Gateway. The subject of the top rail is adoration to five Dagobas and two trees. To illustrate this, compare Bigandet (Legend of the Burmese Buddha, p. 100), and Spence Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, p. 51). Fah-Hian (Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 125) also mentions the several localities round the sacred tree, consecrated by the erection of towers or Dagobas. There are two lists of seven places; first of all those spots which were the scenes of events previous to Buddha\u2019s inspiration; and, secondly, seven others sanctified by his presence after arriving at complete wisdom. The two lists are as follows:\n\nFirst List.\n\n1. The place where he practised austerities for six years.\n2. The place where he bathed and the Deva assisted him.\n3. The place where the two shepherd girls gave him milk and rice.\n4. The place where he ate the rice.\n5. The place where he sat at the entrance of a cave.\n6. The place where the Devas gave him the grass mat.\n7. The place where he sat under the Pei-to tree.\n\nOn each of these spots, Fah-Hian says, towers are erected.\n\nSecond List.\n\n1. Where he sat for seven days beholding the B\u00f4dhi tree.\n2. Where he walked for seven days.\n3. Where the Devas built him a hall.\n4. Where the Dragon Muchalinda protected him.\n5. Where Brahma saluted him.\n6. Where the Four Kings gave him an alms-bowl.\n7. Where the merchants brought him wheat and honey.\nFrom these lists we may select most of the incidents sculptured on the S\u00e2nchi gates.\n\nAnd so we have in the Burmese Life of Gaudama, by Bishop Bigandet, a list of seven trees, under which certain occurrences took place connected with Buddha\u2019s history, and also in the Singhalese accounts. These lists are as follows. (The figures denote the pages of the book.)\n\n**Burmese Account.**\n\n1.

This vessel of consecration, which is several times visible among the sculptures, owes its shape therefore to this comparison.\n\nThe subject of the intermediate rail (rear view) of this gateway is probably the temptation scene of B\u00f4dhisatwa.-\nBigandet's account of this incident is as follows: \"At that time Nats (Devas) surrounded Phralaong (B\u00f4dhisatwa), singing praises to him. The chief Thagia was playing on his conque, the chief N\u00e2ga was uttering stanzas in his honour, a chief Brahma held over him a white umbrella. . . . . Manh Nat (M\u00e2ra), turning to his followers, cried to them, 'there is indeed no one equal to the Prince Theiddat (Sid-dhartha), let us not attack him in front, let us assail him him from the north side.'\" (p. 81.)\n\nIn the sculpture we see the Prince seated on his throne in the centre; the Devas in front are inviting him to advance to the tree; the chief Brahma holding a white umbrella over his head, and the N\u00e2ga just in front reciting his praises; on the right is the ghoulish army of M\u00e2ra, preparing to attack him, directly he takes his seat under the B\u00f4dhi tree.\n\nI consider this explanation tolerably certain. The female figure on the left of the tree is perhaps intended for Sujat\u00e2, with her gift of Nogana (Manual of Buddhism, p. 168, Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 121).\n\nI also identify the scenes on the inner face of the left-hand pillar of this gateway. They are designed to represent events connected with the conversion of the K\u00e2syapas. As these events may be found in all \"Lives of Buddha,\" it will only be necessary to allude briefly to them.\n\nThe upper scene represents the preparation of an offering to be made to K\u00e2syapa. We read in Bigandet (p. 132), \"On a certain day the people of the country had prepared offerings on a large scale, to be presented to K\u00e2syapa,\" or, as Spence Hardy gives it, \"One day great multitudes came from Anga and Magadha, with offerings for Uruvel.\" (Manual of Buddhism, 190.) As to the character of these offerings, we are told, in another place, \"they consisted of bulls, cows, goats, calves,\" etc. (ibid. 272), and we may reasonably suppose that cakes would be included in the list. The upper portion, therefore, of this series of sculptures may well refer to the \"preparation of offerings for the K\u00e2syapas.\" There is an altar, but no tree, from which we may suppose that Buddha was not the object of the intended ceremony, and the group-\ning generally seems to indicate a levity of character, inconsistent with anything we know respecting his worship.\n\nIn the next scene we have Buddha's adventure with the N\u00e2ga (the object of the K\u00e2syapas', and the other fire-worshippers', reverence). In the Pansal or hut, on the right, is seated K\u00e2syapa (Bigandet calls it \"a cell,\" p. 131). In the centre are various animals assembled in the hall for sacrifice. We must not wonder to see the elephant there, for we read (*Manual of Buddhism*, 150): \"On their arrival the animals were all assembled in the place of sacrifice; but when he lifted up his knife to slay the elephant, the affrighted beast cried out,\" etc.\n\nIn the upper centre is the N\u00e2ga Temple; the flames issuing from the roof denote the victory of Buddha. The five men on the right, with closed hands and gratified countenances, denote the five disciples converted in the Deer Park, and the three men on the left, whose hands are unclosed, and whose faces indicate bewilderment rather than joy, would represent the three K\u00e2syapas, who were converted only after a series of subsequent miracles. The figures in front may well represent the disciples of K\u00e2syapa flinging the fire-worshippers' utensils into the water\u00b9 (vid. *Bigandet*, p. 131, and *Manual of Buddhism*, p. 191).\n\nThe lower group I take to be a representation of an immediate preparation of a sacrifice among the fire-worshippers. We have an account of such a scene described in the *Manual of Buddhism* by Spence Hardy, p. 190. The splitting and non-splitting of the wood, the burning and non-burning of the fire, seem here to be indicated. Dr. Fergusson says, with respect to the central figure, that \"he is pouring something into his fire-pot.\" I take it, however, that the old man is simply blowing with his bellows (observe the primitive form of these bellows, both in this figure and in the hands of the old man just below him) into his fire-pot, but the fire won't light, whereas the other fires are burning brightly, according to the words of the legend; and so in the case of the wood-splitting on the right, one of the j\u00f3tis seems to be labouring\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Fergusson however does not agree with this, and I do not wish to urge it.\nin vain to split the log at his feet, whilst the other has it all his own way.\n\nThe lower scene in front on the left-hand pillar of this Gateway I consider to represent life among the Devas. Compare the following extract from the Chinese: \"Persons who die pure in word, deed and thought, are born after death in Heaven. When transported to that higher world, if born of the male sex, they find themselves seated on the knees of lovely women; if born as women, they find themselves seated on the knees of the Heavenly Kings.\" (Hi-Shai S\u00fbtra, quoted in the Fah-kai-lih-to.)\n\nIn this case, we have the scene artfully placed in the lowest compartment of the pillar, so as to engage the attention of devotees and visitors, and tempt them with a very pretty exhibition of \"joys in store\" for the faithful; but the similar scene on the fallen pillar of the western gateway, is portrayed in the upper compartment. The latter picture (Plate xxxvii. fig. 2) is so literally described in a Chinese account of the Triyastri\u00f1shas heaven, that I cannot do better than bring it in here to illustrate the whole subject. \"In the centre of the Triyastri\u00f1shas heaven, is the city of Sakra, called Sudarsana; around this city, are the abodes of the Devas, arranged in a circular order. There are four parks, viz., the Chariot Park for driving and riding, the Park for athletes or the Gymnasium, the Forest Park for rustic pleasures, and the Joy Park, where the Devas and Dev\u00ees give way to every kind of pleasurable indulgence. Each of these parks has a delightful pleasure-bath in the centre of it . . . . At the time of being born in this heaven, a flower is produced in the middle of the hand of one of the Dev\u00ees, by which she knows that a Deva will be born. Accordingly, after seven days, the child is born. He is perfectly acquainted with the divine law, and proceeding to the middle of the palace selected for him, he is met by a goddess, who welcomes him, and serves him. At the time when the Devas wish to go out, the females surround them, they amuse them with every kind of music, they wander from palace to palace, they partake of divine food and drink heavenly nectar, whilst the women afford them every species of delight! Every palace is provided\nwith precious ornaments of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, etc., and each has a lovely park and precious trees belonging to it.\u201d Again, the same work has the following description of the life of the four heavenly kings (chaturmah\u00e2r\u00e2j\u00e2hs). \u201cWhen first born, they are only of a diminutive size, but being provided with vessels full of divine food,\\(^1\\) they become like other Devas. When they have bathed themselves, they lounge below fragrant trees, which bend down their branches to perfume their bodies. They then repair to trees that provide them with clothes; to the adorning trees, to the music trees, to the hair-dressing trees; they wander from one to the other, partake of every species of sensual pleasure, enter delicious baths, and wander from palace to palace.\u201d \\((Fahkai-lih-to.)\\)\n\nThese descriptions seem to tally very well with the luxurious scenes on the pillars alluded to, and may help to redeem the credit of the Buddhist church-militant from the slur to which these representations might otherwise subject it.\n\nBut it may be asked, did Buddhists encourage themselves by hopes of such joys as these in a future world? We find the following quotation in the Chinese work already alluded to. \u201cThe Great \u00c2gama S\u00fbtra\u201d says, \u201cWhoever practises the moral discipline enjoined by Buddha, even though he be not a professed disciple, shall be born in the Triyastri\u00f1shas heaven.\u201d The S\u00fbtra of good rules says, \u201cWhatever priest or priestess observes the 250 rules (viz., of the Pratim\u00f4ksha) shall be born in the Triyastri\u00f1shas heaven.\u201d The miscellaneous \u00c2gama (Samyukt\u00e2gama) says, \u201cWhoever bestows charity, although engaged in worldly pursuits, provided he does not break either of the great commandments, after death shall be born in the world of the Devas.\u201d Again, it is said, \u201cIf any man observe the commandment against killing, then he is born in the heaven of the four great kings; if he neither kills nor robs, he is born in the Triyastri\u00f1shas heaven; if he neither kills, robs, slanders or lusts, he is born in the Yama heaven; if he neither kills, robs, slanders, lusts, or lies, he is born in the Tusita heaven.\u201d\n\nFrom these extracts (and Burnouf, Lotus, 219, will confirm\n\n\\(^1\\) Compare the result of the food given by Thetis to the infant Phoibos (Coxe, Mythology of the Aryan Nations, vol. ii. p. 22).\nthem) we gather the object of the sculptures before us, viz., to remind spectators, by representations (oculis subjecta fidelibus), of the reward even of limited obedience.\n\nThe upper compartment of the left-hand pillar evidently alludes to the descent of Buddha from the Triyastri\u00f1has heaven, on the beautiful ladder which Sakra and Brahma provided (Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 63, etc.). The lowest tablet of this face of the pillar may be intended to describe the joy of the followers of Buddha, on his return from the thirty-three-heavens. They are therefore paying their adoration to the sacred fig-tree.\n\nThe Dagoba scene on the inner face of this pillar perhaps refers to the Dagoba erected on the spot where Buddha alighted from the ladder on which he came down from heaven. At least, Bigandet notices that \"on the spot where all the Buddhas set their feet when coming from the seat of Tawadeintha, a Dzedi has always been erected.\" (Legend of the Burmese Buddha, p. 214).\n\nThe monkey scene below this (Plate xxvi. fig. 2) refers to the legend of the monkeys, who took the p\u0101tra of Buddha and filled it with honey, and then brought it to Buddha (Jul. ii. 387).\n\nThe next scene (Plate xxvi. Fig. 1) alludes, I think, to the honour paid to Buddha by Brahma, related by Fah-Hian (Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 125), whilst the square stone in the rear may refer to the seat which Buddha occupied on this occasion.\n\nI might proceed, if space allowed, to speak of the sculptures on the other gateways; but perhaps enough has been said to establish a probability that these scenes are really quasi-historical, and not mere inventions or meaningless grouping of figures according to the taste of the donor or the artist; and if so, they serve to fix a date, even it be only an approximate one, for the development of the fables to which they allude. We are thus enabled to refer the several records of the adventures of Buddha in his early career to a period at least not later than the Christian era. How much before this we cannot say, but it seems likely that Dr. Fergusson is correct in dating many of the scenes from about the time of As\u00f3ka.\nART. X.\u2014Ancient Inscriptions from Mathura. Translated by Professor J. Dowson.\n\nThe Inscriptions which are the subject of the following observations were collected by General Cunningham at Mathura, in the execution of his functions as Archaeological Surveyor to the Government of India. The account of his visit to Mathura is given in his report for the season 1862\u20133. It is not my intention to do more with these Inscriptions than to offer decipherments and translations, with a few remarks upon their character and language. General Cunningham himself will sum up the results derivable from them. His intimate knowledge of Mathura and other similar localities, his long study of Indian antiquities, and his acquaintance with the coins of the period in public collections and in his own private collection, will enable him to do this much more effectually than I could hope to accomplish.\n\nThe Inscriptions are all Buddhistical, and, like Buddhist inscriptions in general, they commemorate acts of pious devotion. Some of them contain the names of the kings in whose reigns or to whose vih\u0101ras the gifts were made; and, what is of more importance, they give the dates in those old Indian numerals which have been the subject of so much study and controversy. These numerals, although pretty accurately determined, cannot as yet be said to be decisively settled; but the examples which the present Inscriptions supply will afford much help to that desirable object.\n\nProceeding now to the Inscriptions, those containing numerals being of the chief importance, are taken together first in order. The numbers correspond with those on the Plates.\n\n1. Inscription on Base of a Pillar.\n\nSan X Gri 4 Di 4 Mah\u0101-r\u0101jasya R\u0101j\u0101tir\u0101jasya Devaputrasya Huvishkasya Vih\u0101re d\u0101nam bhikshusya J\u012bvakasya Udeyanakasya kumbhako 07 Sarva-hita-sukham bhavatu. Saghe chaturdase.\nYear 47; summer season 4th (month); day 4th. Gift to the vih\u00e2ra of the great king, king of kings, son of the Gods, Huvishka by the mendicant Jivaka of Udeyana. Base of column 25. May it be to the benefit, welfare, and happiness of all. At the fourteenth assembly.\n\n2. Base of Pillar.\n\nD\u00e2nam Devilasya Dadhikarnna-devi-kulikasya San x1 Gri y Divaes \u0398 \u039b.\n\nGift of Devila of the family of Dadhikarnna-devi. Year 47; summer season 4th (month); day 25.\n\nPart of the last figure is defaced so that the unit is illegible. What remains seems to indicate a 5.\n\n3. Fragment. Stone Ladder.\n\nThis Inscription has been partially cut away and mutilated, the stone having been applied to a new purpose. The initial letters of the word Samvatsara (year), the word divase, followed by the numeral \u03c9 (10), and the words asya purvvaye, d\u00e2nam bhikshusya buddha sarvvasa are legible, but they do not yield any complete meaning, though the general purport of the legend is sufficiently obvious.\n\n4. Rough Slab.\n\nMah\u00e2r\u00e2jasya R\u00e2j\u00e2tir\u00e2jasya Deva-putrasya V\u00e2su-devasya Samvatsara X y Varsham\u00e2se-prathame divase tris? Asya purvvaye talekeyam mahadatte sayamkasya v\u00e2 lenasya kutta-mehe.\n\nIn the 44th year of the great king, king of kings, son of the Gods, V\u00e2su-deva, on the 30th day of the first month of the rainy season. On this holy day .\n\nThis record is incomplete, and nothing can be made out of the few mutilated words at the end of the fragment. They apparently contain the names of the donors.\n\n5. Base of Pillar.\n\nSamvatsara x1 Gri = Divase p Asya purvvaye d\u00e2nam bhikshusya Dharmma-devasya.\n\nYear 47; summer season 3rd (month); day 5. Gift on this holy occasion of the mendicant priest Dharmma deva.\n6. Pedestal of Statue.\n\nMah\u0101r\u0101jasya V\u0101su-devasya San Gri = Di Etasya p\u016brvvaye senasya tu dattasu vagra cha vrita cha tanyabhadraka Ap\u00fb maya bhada sangha-pratim\u00e2.\n\n(In the reign) of Mah\u0101-r\u0101j\u0101 V\u0101su-deva, year 83; summer season 2nd (month); day 16. (Gift) of an image on this holy occasion by Sena? ? ?\n\n7. Fragment.\n\nDatta stambha San X Va Di.\n\nPresented, pillar 126. Year 47; rainy season 4th (month); day 11.\n\n8. Pedestal of a Standing Figure of Buddha.\n\n1. Samvatsare sato panchatrisottaratame 135 Pushya-m\u00e2se divase vimshati 20. Deyadharm\u00e2yam vih\u00e2rasya.\n\n2. de v\u00e2y\u00e2. Yadatra-punyam tad bhavatu m\u00e2t\u00e2pitroh sarvva-satwat\u00e2n cha Anuttara-jn\u00e2-s\u00e1ptaye.\n\n3. Saubh\u00e2gyam pratirupat\u00e2 guna cha vikirtti pattakshayah Sundarat\u00e2 vibh\u00e2va-bh\u00fbva sukha-phal\u00e2ni .\n\n4. Astasth\u00e2ni.\n\nIn the year one hundred and thirty-five (135), on the twentieth (20) day of the month Pushya. This votive offering to the Vih\u00e2r. May the pious action here performed tend to the welfare of my parents and all. For the acquisition of the irrefragable doctrine.\n\nThis inscription is of a later date, and is one of the most important of the series, as it gives the date in words as well as in figures. The name of the reigning monarch is not recorded. The inscription is imperfect, but, fortunately, the defective portion is apparently of no importance, as what is left of it consists only of pious aspirations. The sentence in the second line, which clearly reads \"anuttara-jn\u00e2-s\u00e1ptaye,\" is inaccurate. Its correct wording will be found in the following inscription, but more clearly still in No. 18. It is a prayer for the ar\u00e2pti, that is, the acquisition, or, as probably here meant, the spread of the \"anuttara-jn\u00e2na.\" Jn\u00e2na, or knowledge, may be translated as doctrine. Anuttara admits\nof two interpretations, being either that which cannot be excelled, or that which cannot be answered.\n\n9. Well at the Kattra.\n\nDeya-dharm\u00e2yam Yas\u00e2-vih\u00e2re S\u00e2kya-bhikshunyaka yana ya Yad atra punyam tad bhavatu sarvasatwat\u00e2m Anuttara-jn\u00e2n\u00e2v\u00e2ptaye. Samvatsarah 280.\n\nThis is a votive offering to the Yas\u00e2-vih\u00e2ra by the mendicant priest of S\u00e2kya. . . . May this virtuous action tend to the general good. For the acquisition of the irrefragable doctrine.\n\nThere is a faint mark following the figures 280, which may, perhaps, be the remains of the numeral 1; making the date 281.\n\n10. Base of Pillar.\n\nD\u00e2nam bhikhusya Buddha-d\u00e2sasya Sangha-maitrasade vih\u00e2re. Sa(m)panchatrisasya sat\u00e2 rahpetraivvyasyavyasya.\n\nGift of the mendicant priest Buddha-d\u00e2sa to the Sangha-maitrasada vih\u00e2ra. In the year 35? hundred?\n\nThe values of most of the old Indian numerals have been settled by the researches of Mr. Thomas, Bh\u00e2u D\u00e2j\u00ee, and others. I lay no claim to the discovery of any of those now given, for the values of all were marked on the impressions when I received them from the hands of Gen. Cunningham. These Mathura Inscriptions confirm several of the values previously assigned, and they furnish some new and some varying forms. The following are the numerals here found:\n\n|   |   |\n|---|---|\n| 3 | \u2261 |\n| 4 | 4 |\n| 5 | \u1e47 |\n| 6 | \u03b5 |\n| 7 | 1 |\n| 10 | \u221e |\n| 11 | \u221e |\n| 20 | \u0398 |\n| 30 | \u039b |\n| 40 | X |\n| 80 | \u03c9 |\n| 100 | \u03a3 |\n\nThe second form of the 5 is slightly variant. The plain cross for the 40 is new, but it is a simpler form of the figure given by Bh\u00e2u D\u00e2j\u00ee. The figure for 30 is more elaborate\nthan the form hitherto discovered, and so is the figure for 100 used in the same inscription. In fact, the figures for 100, 30, and 5 used in this inscription would have been doubtful if the value of them had not also been expressed in words.\n\nThe remaining inscriptions are of less interest, and several of them are not given in the Plates. I append transliterations and translations so far as they are intelligible.\n\n11. Base of Pillar.\n\nD\u0101nam bhikshusya Buddha-ghoshasya phala . . .\nGift of the mendicant priest Buddha ghosha, the fruit.\n\n12. Base and Plinth of Pillar.\n\nD\u0101nam Vasu-mihira-putrasya putra madesa . . .\nGift of . . . son of Vasu mihira.\nD\u0101nam Viswa-devakasya Vasu-mihirasya Sinha putr . .\nImena devidharma parity\u0101.\nGift of Viswa devaka Vasu-mihira . . .\nThe eye copy makes the name Vasu-deva to differ slightly in the two legends, but there can be no hesitation in considering it to be the same.\n\n13. Base of Pillar.\n\n. . . . Mihirasya Sinha putra . . . Deva dharma pu . . .\n. . . . of Mihira, son of Sinha . . .\nThis again contains the name of the same donor as the two preceding legends, but altogether the portions legible do not furnish a complete version.\n\n14.

Yad atra punyam tad bhavatu sarvva-satw\u0101n\u0101m.\nAnuttara-jn\u0101n\u0101v\u0101ptaye.\nThe votive offering of Bhadatta Brahma-soma, mendicant priest of S\u0101kya.

Large Slab.\n\nThese contain many names, and are so damaged that no connected sense can be made out. The words vih\u00e2re kakatik\u00e2n\u00e2m, in the vih\u00e2ra of the Kakatikas; and Sangha prakirtahi vyav\u00e2h\u00e2re hi upath\u00e2pit\u00e2ye can be read.\n\n29.\n\nThis inscription is unfortunately imperfect. The stone upon which it was graven seems to have been very cleanly cut through, and the first part of it carried off. There can be no certainty as to how much has thus been lost, but probably very little. The following is a transcription:\u2014\n\n. . . sw\u00e2misya mah\u00e2-kshatrapasya S\u00e2nd\u00e2sasya Gajavarena Brahmanena Sangrava-sagotrena.\n. . . rani.

It records (a gift) by the brahman Gaja-varena of the Sangrava gotra in the time of the great Satrap Sandasa, (lieutenant) of the lord paramount (swami). . . . The gift appears to have consisted of tanks called Jaya-mada, a western tank, a well, a garden, a pillar; but in the absence of a verb no definite meaning can be attached to the words. The absence of this part of the inscription is of no consequence, but it would be interesting to see who was the swami or lord paramount of the Satrap Sandasa.\n\nThe language of all the inscriptions is Sanskrit, not Pali, but it shows some interesting deviations from the classical forms. For Rajadhiraja we find Rajatiraja, but this may be an unusual though legitimate form, the preposition ati being used instead of the commoner adhi. The word bhikshu in a few instances has its proper genitive form bhikshoh, but it generally appears as \"bhikshusya,\" following the declension of the much more numerous class of nouns in a. Muni, in the only instance in which it appears, has similarly the genitive \"munisya,\" instead of the proper form muneh. The word vihare appears in the locative form where the dative might be expected, showing a leaning to the Prakrits, which reject the dative.\n\nThe seasons of the year are used for the purposes of dates. Some instances of this use are given by Bhau Daji from the Western Caves. These inscriptions show that the division of the year into three seasons was the one employed.\n\nPS.\u2014Some months after the preceding notes had been read before the Society, I received from Babu Rajendra Lal a copy of a paper on several of the same Inscriptions which he published in No. II. of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1870. His Essay and mine, therefore, represent two entirely independent investigations of the same set of Inscriptions. As the Babu's paper arrived before this had been set up in type, I take the opportunity of\nmaking a few remarks upon some parts of it, which seem open to objection.\n\nThe translations of the Inscriptions are generally in accordance, but there are several important points of difference. I have weighed the B\u00e2b\u00fb\u2019s readings very carefully and candidly, but in no case have I felt constrained to surrender my own versions.\n\nGeneral Cunningham in his note following this has remarked upon the B\u00e2b\u00fb\u2019s very incorrect rendering of the numerals, which are the most valuable portions of the Inscriptions. I may say at once that I give up the B\u00e2b\u00fb\u2019s renderings as beyond my understanding. The \u201c40th day of the year 59,\u201d and \u201cthe 80th day of the year 59,\u201d are forms of dates which are new to me, and for which I can find no warrant in the Inscriptions. Though the B\u00e2b\u00fb shows that he is acquainted with Bh\u00e2u D\u00e2j\u00ee\u2019s investigations of the Inscriptions in the Western Caves, where the Seasons of the Year are employed in the dates, he has failed to perceive that the same custom is observed in these Inscriptions. So, the following difficulty is encountered. The word varsha means both year and rainy season, but the applicability of the latter sense not having been seen, the B\u00e2b\u00fb explains the sentence in which it occurs, and which begins with the distinct word samvatsara (year), by saying varsha \u201cis used very much in the same way as if a man were to say \u2018in the year 44 Anno Domini.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother reading of the B\u00e2b\u00fb\u2019s is most important if it could be substantiated. He reads in one Inscription the date \u201c140th \u015aaka year,\u201d and thereupon proceeds to argue that the \u015aaka was the era employed. If this could be proved, it would have a most important bearing on Hindu Chronology. I failed to perceive either the word or the figures in the paper impression of the inscription; and on referring to the B\u00e2b\u00fb\u2019s engraving, I find the word which he reads \u015aaka, to be written with the dental s (\u0936), not, as it ought to be, with the palatal \u1e63 (\u0937). This is fatal to his reading. Further, the word so read follows the word d\u0101nam, intervening between that and what is evidently part of the donor\u2019s name. No\ndate could be inserted in such a position. I have no doubt whatever that these obscure letters are parts of the donor's name or title.\n\nThe B\u0101b\u016b, while stating the inscriptions on the pillars to be records of gifts, raises the question \"whether in the case of inscriptions, recording gifts (d\u0101na) without specifying their nature, they are to be taken as mere records of gifts, or of the gift of the objects on which they occur.\" He then goes on to say, \"Gen. Cunningham is in favour of the latter alternative... There is generally, however, no pronoun of any kind in such inscriptions to fix such a meaning, and it often happens, that a single bar of a railing records two or three or more gifts of a different date, each in the usual form of gifts of so and so.\" He then notices the Inscription No. 12, in which the inscription on the base says, Gift of so and so, and that on the plinth, Gift of some one else. A single railing bearing records of several gifts of different dates has never come under my notice; but, dealing with the Inscriptions before us, there seems to be no reason why two persons, naturally or spiritually related, might not agree to contribute separate parts of a column. The B\u0101b\u016b's reading of this short inscription is rather different from mine. I find that the two donors are connected by a common patronymic Vasu-mihira. What can the words \"Gift of,\" inscribed upon a pillar or anything else, mean, unless it be that the object so inscribed is the thing given? If we find a stained window inscribed \"Gift of \u2014,\" do we understand that something else was given, not the window? It might have been convenient to make records of gifts on pillars, railings, or other conspicuous objects; but, unless the object inscribed were the one presented, some mention would undoubtedly have been made of what the gift really was. The earliest researches of Prinsep showed the gift of a pillar to be a favourite act of Buddhist devotion, and two of these Inscriptions (1 and 23) distinctly state the base of the pillar to have been the donation. The B\u0101b\u016b seems not to have been aware that the word kumbha or kumbhaka,\\(^1\\) has \"base of a pillar\" among its other meanings;\n\n\\(^1\\) See B\u00fcthlingk and Roth.\nand so in Inscription No. 1, he has read *kumbhako* 25 (base of pillar 25) as *kumbhaka-sanjna*, which he translates \"breath suspended,\" and applies it as an epithet to the donor.\n\nTo the Inscriptions from Mathura the B\u00e2b\u00fb has added one obtained by General Cunningham from S\u00e2het M\u00e2het which place the General identifies with the Sr\u00e2vasti of the Buddhist records. This Inscription General Cunningham has introduced at the end of Plate III., and I now proceed to offer a transcription and a suggestive translation. B\u00e2b\u00fb R\u00e2jendra has done the same before me, and we agree in some words; but as he considers the \"document very puzzling,\" and \"the translation a mere guess,\" I refrain from quoting his version. General Cunningham himself, in his Report, gave readings of the names and other portions of the Inscription, including the name of Sr\u00e2vasti in the second line.\n\nEtaye purvaye bhikshusya Pushpa . . . sya Saddhy\u00e2 Mihirasya bhikshusya Bapusya Trepitakasya d\u00e2nam. Buddhisatwo ch\u00e2tram d\u00e2nosru s\u00e2vastiye bhagavato chankame. Kosumba ku\u1e6diye Achayy\u00e2no sarvasti dinam parigrahe.\n\nSuch is the transliteration of the Inscription as it appears in the engraving. The commencement is wanting, but there are traces of figures, one of which seems to be 10. I have not had the advantage of seeing the impression, or it is possible I might have detected some rudimentary signs which would justify the reading of Bodhisatwo instead of Buddhisatwo and Sr\u00e2vasti instead of \u0160\u00e2vasti, etc. The engraving is much superior to that accompanying B\u00e2b\u00fb R\u00e2jendra's paper, but the letters in italics remain uncertain after a comparison of both. In the B\u00e2b\u00fb's copy an additional letter *ta* appears between *sarvasti* and *dinam*.\n\nI am unable to extract any continuous sense out of this legend. The first part records the fact of the statue being the gift of the mendicants\u2014Mihira and Bapu Trepit\u00e2ka. After this follows the word *Buddhisatwo* for *Bodhisatwa*, and the word *chh\u00e2tram*, disciple in the accusative case. There is no verb, however, to govern this accusative, and so the dot representing it may possibly be an accidental addition. Next comes a doubtful word, then *s\u00e2vastiye bhagavato chan-\nkame. This may mean that the donors were disciples of the bodhisatwa, and their donation was made to the holy chan-\nkama, whatever that was, at Sravasti. In the following line,\nkosumba-kutiye, may be translated as \u201cto the flowery dwell-\ning,\u201d which is probably the name of the temple. This last\nsentence probably means, \u201cFor the regular use of the dis-\nciples of the acharya (teacher) at the Kosumba-kuti.\u201d\n\nThe language of this Inscription bears strong signs of the\ntransition from Sanskrit to Pali. The compound letters of\nthe Sanskrit keep their place, but besides the genitive\nbhikshusya, we have satwo and bhagavato followed by a hard\nconsonant, and the dative forms savastiye and kutiye.\n\nNote on the preceding Mathura Inscriptions.\u2014By Major-General\nA. Cunningham.\n\nThe circumstances under which these inscriptions were\ndiscovered are detailed in my Archaeological Report for\n1862-3, par. 159-184.\n\nProfessor Dowson\u2019s translations were handed over to me in\nthe end of April last, and I read them at a meeting of the\nRoyal Asiatic Society on the 5th of July, just four months\nbefore the receipt of Babu Rajendralal\u2019s translations, which\nappeared in the Bengal Asiatic Society\u2019s Journal for 1870,\np. 117-130. But the Babu\u2019s translations are confined to the\ninscriptions which I first made known to Mr. E. C. Bayley\nin November or December, 1860, by the copies which are\nnow engraved in the Bengal Journal. Mr. Bayley visited\nMathura early in April, 1861, and made independent copies\nof most of these inscriptions; and in 1863 a considerable\nnumber of the inscribed stones were forwarded to Calcutta,\nwhere Babu Rajendra had the opportunity of studying them\nat leisure. The Babu mentions that the inscriptions which\nhe has translated are taken from my transcripts, \u201cwith such\ncorrections and emendations as a careful examination of the\noriginal and comparison with Mr. Bayley's transcripts would warrant.\" As a single specimen of the nature of the corrections and emendations effected by B\u00e2bu R\u00e2jendra, after this careful examination of my transcripts, I need only refer to the first inscription, in which the vowel \u00e1 in r\u00e2jatir\u00e2ja, and the compound letter sya in bhikshusya, both of which were accidentally omitted in my hurried transcript sent to Mr. Bayley, are also omitted in the present Calcutta transcript, which the B\u00e2bu professes to have corrected and amended from the original. The only alteration which he has made is in the final letter \u00a7, which he has changed to t, although he reads it as \u00a7.\n\nThe Plates of these inscriptions, which accompany the present translations by Professor Dowson, have been reduced by photography from paper-impressions of the originals. About one-half of these inscriptions, including several of the most important, were discovered by me in 1862 and 1865, and were unknown to B\u00e2bu R\u00e2jendra. Amongst these new inscriptions is one (No. VI.) of Mahar\u00e2ja V\u00e1sudeva, dated in the year 83; the previously discovered inscription of the same king (No. IV.) being dated in the year 44. No. VIII. inscription is of special value, as the date, 165 Samvat, is given in writing as well as in figures. No. XXIX., which is the earliest inscription yet found at Mathura, belongs to a Satrap named Sand\u00fb\u1e63a, of whom I possess several coins. This inscription is probably as early as b.c. 100. Inscriptions XXX. and XXXI. are simply the numbers 118 and 127.\n\nIn the translations of these inscriptions, Professor Dawson has adopted, without a single alteration, the whole of my readings of the dates, which I communicated to him at the rooms of the Royal Asiatic Society, where I met him by appointment, for the purpose of making over the paper-impressions of the inscriptions. My readings of the dates had long before been noted on these impressions. I mention this fact because, at the end of the translations, Professor Dowson states that the values of most of the old Indian numerals have been settled by the researches of Mr. Thomas, Bh\u00e2u D\u00e2j\u00ee, and others. Of how little assistance this \"settle-\nment\u201d of the numerals has been in the case of the Mathura inscriptions, may be seen on comparing B\u00e2bu R\u00e2jendra\u2019s readings of the dates with my readings now given by Professor Dowson.\n\nI do not presume to offer any verbal criticism on the translations of these two well-known scholars; but I may note a single misreading into which both of them have fallen. It is in the last word of No. I. inscription, which should be chatur-di\u1e63e, \u201cin the four quarters,\u201d and not chatur-da\u1e63e, \u201cthe fourteenth.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, I am so pressed for time by my approaching departure for India, that I cannot do more than offer a few words on the historical importance of these inscriptions. In No. I. we find that Mathura possessed a Vih\u0101ra of the great king Huvi\u0161ka, whose name is also found in the Aryan Pali inscription of Wardak, near Ghazni, and who is no doubt the Hushka of the R\u00e2jatarangini and the Oerke of the Indo-Scythian coins. In this inscription therefore we have proof of the accuracy of the Chinese accounts of the Turushka Indo-Scythians, that they had conquered the whole of Northern India. Nos. IV. and VI. belong to king V\u00e2su-deva, who takes the title of Deva-putra, which is given to Kanishka in the Bah\u00e2walpur Tope inscription. His dates of 44 and 83 show that he enjoyed a long reign, which we learn also from the abundance of his coins. The name is written BAZO-AHO in corrupt Greek both on the gold and copper coins, and this reading is confirmed by a few of the gold coins which also bear a part of his name in Sanskrit characters, V\u00e2su, written perpendicularly, as on the well-known coins of the Guptas. From the pure Hindu name of V\u00e2sudera, we might suppose that he was a Hindu; but as the coins give him the well-known tribal title of Korano, which was borne both by Kanishka or Kanerke, and by Huvi\u0161ka or Ho\u00ebrke, it seems certain that V\u00e2su-deva, in spite of his pure Indian name, must have been an Indo-Scythian. If so, may we not suppose that the descendants of the Indo-Scythians gradually became Indianized, and that they must now be sought for amongst some of the inferior\ntribes in the North-West, such as the J\u00e2ts and Gujars, with whom I have already proposed to identify them?\n\nI will conclude these remarks by referring the reader to the Samudra Gupta inscription on the Allahabad Pillar, in which the king, after mentioning the Sakas, speaks of the Devaputra Shah\u00e2n Shah\u00ee, who must therefore have been the Turushka king of the Panj\u00e2b. This has an important bearing on the age of the Guptas, as it makes Samudra Gupta a contemporary of the Turushka kings, whose dominion, according to the Chinese authorities, had already passed away in the beginning of the third century after Christ.\n\nThe dates in these inscriptions I refer to the era of Vikram\u00e2ditya, as we know that both Kanishka and Huvishka preceded the establishment of the \u0160aka era. V\u00e2sudeva's reign would therefore have extended from B.C. 13 to A.D. 26, and his coins were the immediate precursors of those of Ghatal Kacha, the father of Chandra Gupta I., who probably reigned from A.D. 50 to 75.\nART. XI.\u2014Specimen of a Translation of the \u00c2di Granth.\n\nBy Dr. Ernest Trumpp.\n\nIn offering to the learned public a specimen of a translation of the \u00c2di Granth (or first holy book of the Sikhs), we premise a few words on the language in which that work is composed, as hitherto wrong notions have been entertained on this point. The language of the \u00c2di Granth is not the old Hindi, as has been recently stated, if the old Hind\u00ee (if it may be called so) is taken identical with the Hind\u00fb\u00ee, the language of the middle age of India, from which the present Hind\u00ee has sprung, and which is now nearly extinct. Even the learned Garcin de Tassy was of opinion that the \u00c2di Granth was written in Hind\u00fb\u00ee, but he had apparently not paid any attention to the study of this work, and his statement can, therefore, be only a surmise.\n\nThe language in which the \u00c2di Granth is composed we would propose to call the old Gurmukh\u00ee, for it is in reality the mother of the modern Gurmukh\u00ee, and it differs as much from the Hind\u00fb\u00ee (the term \"old Hind\u00ee\" we will discard, to avoid misconceptions) as the modern Gurmukh\u00ee differs from the Hind\u00ee. It is true there is a close relationship between the old Gurmukh\u00ee and the Hind\u00fb\u00ee, especially in the nomenclature; but the grammatical forms, on the other hand, differ so much, that they can hardly be identified, as little as the modern Gurmukh\u00ee can be classed under the Hind\u00ee. We will not enter into details here to prove our assertion; for\n\n1 Garcin de Tassy: Rudiments de la langue Hindou\u00ee, p. 4, note 5.\nevery one who has read the Hindu\u00ee compositions, as contained in Garcin de Tassy\u2019s \u201cChrestomathie Hindie et Hindouie,\u201d will perceive at once the difference. We will only adduce a few striking points of difference between the old Gurmukh\u00ee and the Hindu\u00ee: The old Gurmukh\u00ee has a regular Passive voice (like the Sindh\u00ee), the Hindu\u00ee only the compound Passive voice; the whole conjugation of the old Gurmukh\u00ee differs considerably from that of the Hindu\u00ee; the old Gurmukh\u00ee uses pronominal suffixes with the verbs, especially the past participle, which is quite unknown in Hindu\u00ee, but current in Sindh\u00ee. As regards the declensional process, the old Gurmukh\u00ee has, like the Sindh\u00ee, a regular Locative, Ablative, and Instrumental (plur.) case, which are not to be found in Hindu\u00ee. Besides the (adjectival) Genitive case sign \u0915\u093e, \u0915\u0940, etc., we find already the modern Gurmukh\u00ee form \u0926\u093e, \u0926\u0940. The idiom which stands nearest the old Gurmukh\u00ee is not the Hindu\u00ee, but the Sindh\u00ee; in fact, without a knowledge of Sindh\u00ee the old Gurmukh\u00ee cannot be understood at all. We allow that also specific Hindu\u00ee forms are to be met with in the \u00c2di Granth; but we have no doubt that such like forms point to a later origin, and are to be considered as interpolations. The matter is quite different with the Dasv\u0113 p\u0101ts\u0101h k\u0101 granth, the composition of Govind Singh; this work is (with the exception of the Persian portion) written altogether in Hindu\u00ee. The language of the \u00c2di Granth is now totally antiquated, and may be considered as dead, for the Sikhs themselves, when quoting a passage from the \u00c2di Granth, add a regular translation.\n\n1 And even with nouns; examples of this kind are even found in the MSS. of the \u00c2di Granth.\n\n2 Very important in this respect is the work printed at Ludih\u0101\u1e47\u0101 (Loodiana), A.D. 1868, and composed by Pan\u1e0dit Sardh\u0101 R\u0101ma, under the title \u0938\u093f\u0916\u093e\u0902 \u0926\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u091c \u0926\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093e, history of the Sikh power. It gives various passages from the \u00c2di Granth, with a translation, from which we may see that even the learned Sikhs frequently misinterpret the words of the \u00c2di Granth, and are not always sure of the meaning of difficult words and passages.\nThe translation offered here we would only call a first attempt; for we had only the manuscripts before us, without any commentary or any other help whatever. There is neither a grammar nor a dictionary of the old Gurmukhi, and we had to find out the different grammatical forms by mere comparison with the Sindhi, Hindui, and the modern Gurmukhi. Besides the difficulties arising from the more or less unknown or doubtful grammatical forms, the manuscripts, without exception, are written in such a way that all the words in a line are joined together, so that it is often difficult to separate the words, as occasionally, as a letter more or less may be added or cut off, the sense will become quite different. We trust, however, that these and other difficulties will be speedily overcome, when we shall have the assistance of a learned Sikh priest in India.\n\nFor want of Gurmukhi types, we have made a literal transcription in the ordinary Devan\u00e2gar\u00ee character.\n\n\u0950 \u0938\u0924\u093f \u0928\u093e\u092e\u0941 \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0916\u0941 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u092d\u0943\u0924 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u0935\u0947\u0926 \u090b\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0941 \u092e\u0942\u0930\u0924\u093f \u090b\u091c\u0941\u0928\u0940 \u0938\u0948\u0902\u092d \u0964 \u0917\u0941\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0926\u093f \u0965\n\nOm!

The Sikh traditional explanation (\u0938\u0902\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u093e\u092f) differs from the translation given above; they explain \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0940 (which we take to be identical with \u092a\u0942\u0930\u0940) by city, and \u092d\u093e\u0930 by multitude, but neither can be proved by the Bh\u00e2kk\u00e2, besides that it gives no proper sense. \u0939\u094b\u0908\u0902\u091a\u093f is a passive form, applied in a neuter sense, it may be become; this is borne out by a great many passages of the \u00c2di Granth. \u092a\u093e\u0932\u093f s.f. properly a layer of stones or bricks = wall. \u0907\u0915\u092e\u093f is the Locative\nsing.

XII.\u2014Notes on Dhammapada, with Special Reference to the Question of Nirv\u00e2na. By R. C. Childers, late of the Ceylon Civil Service.\n\nI have given in the following pages some of the results of a careful study of the text of Dhammapada, rendered necessary by the preparation of a P\u00e1li Dictionary. In endeavouring to elucidate some of the obscure or difficult points of this important text, I have given prominence to a few passages enabling me to test the theory of Nirv\u00e2na which I propounded last year in the columns of a periodical.\n\nVerse 203. Jighaech\u00e1param\u00e1 rog\u00e1, sa\u1e45kh\u00e1r\u00e1 param\u00e1 dukh\u00e1,\nEtam \u00f1atr\u00e1 yath\u00e1bhi\u00f1an nibb\u00e1nam paraman sukhan.\n\nThe sense of this verse is, \"As hunger is worse than any disease, so existence is worse than any pain; to him who has realized this truth extinction is the greatest bliss.\" If any proof is wanted that the author of Dhammapada believed Nirv\u00e2na to be the annihilation of being, it is surely here. When he says in the same breath that existence is the acme of suffering, and that Nirv\u00e2na is consequently the highest bliss, it follows logically and inevitably that Nirv\u00e2na must be the cessation of existence. Nirv\u00e2na must here be taken as Anupadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u00e2na. Sa\u1e45kh\u00e1r\u00e1 (in the plural) is used almost in the sense of \"organic life.\" The comment says, \"the five Skandhas,\" which amounts very much to the same thing; for the Skandhas are the attribute of every organized being, however low in the scale of animal life. Compare the expression sabbe sa\u1e45khat\u00e1sasa\u1e45khatadhamm\u00e1, \"all things organized and unorganized,\" or \"all things animate and inanimate,\" which includes, of course, the whole realm of creation. I take this opportunity of re-stating the theory of Nirv\u00e2na which I published in the July and October numbers of Tr\u00fcbner's Record for 1870; and I may observe that my\ntheory meets, as far as I know, all the difficulties of the question, and holds good in every instance in which I have tested it.\n\nNirv\u0101\u1e47a means extinction or annihilation. It is the ultimate goal of Buddhism, the supreme reward of the highest spiritual development, the *summum bonum* to which the follower of \u00c7\u00e0kyamuni is taught to look. What, then, is this Nirv\u0101\u1e47a or extinction which is the reward of virtuous action? It is twofold\u2014Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a, or the extinction of human passion; and Anupadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a, or the annihilation of being. There are eight progressive stages of sanctification, called the Four Paths and the Four Fruitions:\u00b9 the last and highest of these stages is called Arhattvaphala, or \u201cfull fruition of final sanctification,\u201d and this is Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a, or, as it is also called, Kle\u00e7apari\u00f1irv\u0101\u1e47a. Arhatship or Arhattvaphala is admittedly a state of the highest happiness and perfection, and its identity with Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a, or, as it is more generally called, simply Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, cannot be too strongly insisted upon, since it accounts for the frequency with which Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is spoken of as a state of bliss. This, then, is one of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47as, the other is Anupadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u0101\u1e47a or Skandhaparinirv\u0101\u1e47a,\u00b2 which it is impossible to explain as anything but absolute annihilation. The Arhat, or being who has attained final sanctification,\u00b3 though wholly free from human passion, and possessed of superhuman faculties, is still a man, and liable, like all other men, to death. Nor is his life necessarily prolonged beyond that of his fellows; \u00c7\u00e0kyamuni himself, the Great Arhat, died at an age not exceeding the common lot of humanity. But the Arhat, alone of men, when he dies ceases to exist. The oil in the lamp of life is burnt out, the seed of existence is withered, he enters the vast portals of Nothingness and Void, and entering vanishes from creation,\u2014he has attained to Skandhaparinirv\u0101\u1e47a, the annihilation of the elements of being. I have said that Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is twofold; but is it not also one? for Skandhaparinirv\u0101\u1e47a is\n\n\u00b9 In P\u0101li Catt\u0101ro Magga and Catt\u0101ri phal\u0101ni.\n\u00b2 Generally called simply Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\n\u00b3 Arhattvaphala or Kle\u00e7apari\u00f1irv\u0101\u1e47a.\nthe necessary complement of Kle\u00e7aparinirv\u00e2na, as the latter is of the former. Without Arhatship there can be no cessation of existence,\\(^1\\) just as there can be no Arhatship that does not terminate in extinction. Viewed, therefore, from a distance as it were, as the goal of the pious Buddhist, Nirv\u00e2na is one; it is a brief period of the highest bliss on earth, ending in eternal death. It may here be objected\u2014Must not great confusion be created by using one and the same term for two things so different as \u201cbliss\u201d and \u201cannihilation\u201d? I reply that in reality there is no such confusion, since the context will readily determine whether, by the word Nirv\u00e2na, Upadhi\u00e7esha or Anupadhi\u00e7esha Nirv\u00e2na is intended. And in a vast proportion of instances the term embraces both Nirv\u00e2nas. Thus in such a sentence as \u201cNirv\u00e2na is the reward of a virtuous life,\u201d it is clear that both Nirv\u00e2nas are meant, since they are inseparably connected, and the one involves the other as a necessary consequence. There are, however, occasions when one of the Nirv\u00e2nas is distinctly alluded to, and then the context determines which of them is meant. Thus in verse 89 the word loke specifies Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u00e2na, while in the verse we have been considering Anupadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u00e2na is clearly indicated by the use of the word sa\u00f1kh\u00e2ra.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to add that the much contested word Parinirv\u00e2na means \u201cthe attainment of Nirv\u00e2na,\u201d or simply Nirv\u00e2na. Like Nirv\u00e2na it is twofold, Kle\u00e7aparinirv\u00e2na, \u201cattainment of the extinction of human passion,\u201d and Skandhaparinirv\u00e2na, \u201cattainment of the annihilation of the elements of being.\u201d When the Parinirv\u00e2na of an Arhat is spoken of, it may be translated \u201cdeath\u201d; for in the case of an Arhat, death and the attainment of Nirv\u00e2na are simultaneous. The word Mah\u00e2parinirv\u00e2na merely means the death of Buddha.\n\nVerse 89. Te loke parinibbut\u00e1, \u201cthey attain Nirv\u00e2na in this world\u201d; that is they attain Upadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u00e2na or Arhatship, which is compatible with existence. Parinibbuta (pari+nis+vrta) is always used for the part. perf. pass. of parinibb\u00e2ti, \u201cto attain Nirv\u00e2na.\u201d The regular p.p.p. would be parinibb\u00e2na,\n\n\\(^1\\) I mean, of course, on this earth, since, for instance, an An\u00e2g\u00e2min attains Skandhaparinirv\u00e2na from one of the Brahma heavens.\nbut there is a confusion in P\u00e1li between the compounds nirv\u00e1 and nirv\u00e1ri, so much so that nibbuti (nirvriti) means both happiness (or tranquillity) and annihilation.\\(^1\\) It is well known that this sort of confusion is frequent in P\u00e1li. An important reason against the use of parinibb\u00e1na as the p.p.p. of parinibb\u00e1ti is that it would be readily mistaken for the noun parinibb\u00e1na. When used of an Arhat parinibbuta may be translated \u201chaving died,\u201d e.g. Lokan\u00e1the dasabale satt\u00e1ha-parinibbute, \u201cwhen the world\u2019s protector endowed with the ten forces had been dead seven days.\u201d\\(^2\\)\n\nVerse 153. *Anekaj\u00e1tisams\u00e1ram sandh\u00e1vissam anibbisam*\n*Gahak\u00e1raka\u1e41 gavesanto dukkh\u00e1 j\u00e1ti punappunam.*\n\n\u201cI have run through the revolution of countless births, seeking the Architect of this dwelling and finding him not, grievous is repeated birth.\u201d Fausb\u00f6ll takes sandh\u00e1vissam as a conditional,\\(^3\\) but the sense imperatively requires an aorist, and Mr. Trenckner pointed out to me some time ago that sandh\u00e1vissam in this place is a true aorist, the Sanskrit aorist in -isham. The third persons sing. and plur. of this aorist occur pretty frequently in P\u00e1li, and end in -isi and -isum respectively. The doubled s has many analogies in P\u00e1li. The learned Sthavira Dhamm\u00e1rama of Y\u00e1tr\u00e1mull\u00e9 has favoured me with a long extract from Culla Saddan\u00edti, in which the author, misled by the doubled s, calls sandh\u00e1vissam \u201ca future in a past sense\u201d (*atitatthe bhavissanti hoti*), and cites a passage from the Tripitaka book Vim\u00e1nava\u1e6d\u1e6dhu containing an analogous example. The passage is as follows:\u2014\n\n*C\u00e1tuddasim pa\u00f1cadasim y\u00e1va pakkhassa atthami*\n*P\u00e1tih\u00e1riyapakkha\u00f1 ca atthangasusam\u00e1hitam*\n*Uposathan upavasissam sad\u00e1 silesu samvut\u00e1.*\n\nHere Culla Saddan\u00edti remarks, *Imiss\u00e1 Vim\u00e1nava\u1e6d\u1e6dhup\u00e1liy\u00e1 attham sanvannentchi \u201cupavasissan ti upavasim atitatthe hi idam an\u00e1gatavacanan ti vuttan\u201d ti saccam vutta\u1e41*, \u201cthe com-\n\n\\(^1\\) See Abhidh\u00e1nappad\u00edpik\u00e1, v. 1015.\n\\(^2\\) Mah\u00e1va\u1e41sa, p. 11.\n\\(^3\\) In P\u00e1li the 1st pers. fut. \u00e1tmane, and the 1st pers. cond. (parassa and \u00e1tmane) both end in -issam. In the cond. the augment may be dropped, so that sandh\u00e1vissam might be a future or a conditional.\n\\(^4\\) Sanskrit \u00f1t (for ish\u00edt), and isuh.\n\\(^5\\) Compare Dh. p. 404.\nmentators upon this passage of Vim\u00e1navatthu observe with truth that *upavasissam* is for *upavasi\u1e47\u012b*, for here the future is used in a past sense.\"\n\nVerse 166. *Attadattham paratthena bahun\u0101 pi na h\u00e1paye*\n*Attadattham abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ya sadatthapasuto siy\u0101.*\n\nI think the meaning of this verse is, \"Let him not forego his own spiritual good for the sake of another man's, however great; when he has discerned his own spiritual good, let him devote himself thereto.\" This is, I think, in accordance with the comment, and makes the sentiment one to which no exception can be taken, even from a Christian point of view. *Attha* is constantly used in P\u00e1li in the sense of spiritual good, and this very word *sadattha* (sva-artha) is used at page 12 of Turnour's Mah\u00e1vamsa, where Arhatship or spiritual perfection is intended. The words are:\u2014\n\n*Sve sannip\u0101to, \u0100nanda; sekhena gaman\u0101\u1e43 tahi\u1e43*\n*Na yuttan te; sadatthe tr\u0101\u1e47 appamatto tato bhava.*\n\n\"To-morrow, \u0100nanda, is the convocation, it is not right that thou shouldst attend it while yet imperfect, strive earnestly therefore for thy spiritual good.\"\n\nVerse 32. *Appam\u00e1darato bhikkhu pam\u00e1de bhayadassiv\u00e1*\n*Abhabbo pari\u1e25\u00e1naya nibb\u00e1nass' eva santike.*\n\nThe meaning of *pari\u1e25\u00e1na* here is \"falling away,\" \"falling off,\" \"retrogression.\" The comment says, \"A priest who is in this state is not liable to fall away either from the state of tranquillity and contemplation, or from the Four Paths and their fruition: if he has attained them, he cannot lose them; if he has not yet attained them, he cannot fail to do so.\" Compare the passage at Dham. p. 254, where Godhika Thera is said to have attained the first Jh\u00e1na and then fallen away from it: the expressions used are, \"*sam\u0101dhikam cetovimuttim phusitv\u0101 tato pari\u1e25\u00e1yi,*\" \"*chakkhattum jh\u0101nam nibbattetv\u0101 pari\u1e25ino,*\" \"*jh\u0101na pari\u1e25ino.*\"\u00b9 I would render the whole verse \"The recluse who delights in diligence, who sees danger in sloth, is not liable to fall away from holiness, but is close upon\n\n\u00b9 Compare also Dham. verse 364, *Dhamma\u1e43 anussara\u1e47a\u1e43 bhikkhu saddhamm\u0101 na pari\u1e25\u00e1yati*, the recluse who remembers the Law will never fall away from true religion.\nthe attainment of Nirv\u00e2na.\u201d That is to say, his salvation is assured, nothing can prevent its accomplishment. Nibb\u00e2na here means kle\u00e7aparin\u00eerv\u00e2na or Arhatship (see the comment).\n\nVerse 55. Candanam tagara\u00f1 v\u00e1 pi uppalam atha vassiki\n\nEtesam gandhaj\u00e1tanam silagandho anuttaro.\n\nThe meaning of the second hemistych is, \u201cThe perfume of virtue (s\u00edla) far surpasses the perfume of these spices.\u201d There is a confusion in the construction, as the literal rendering would be, \u201cOf these sorts of perfumes (gandhaj\u00e1t\u00e1ni), the perfume of virtue is the best.\u201d I do not see how s\u00edla can be taken as anything but the Sanskrit \u00e7ila; the commentator takes it so, and the analogy of the preceding and following verses requires it.\n\nVerse 71. Na hi p\u00e1pam katan kamman sajjukhiram va muceati\n\nDaham tam b\u00e1lam anveti bhasm\u00e1ccchanno va p\u00e1vako.\n\nThe word muceati, in P\u00e1li, when applied to milk, means \u201cto curdle,\u201d literally, \u201cto be got rid of,\u201d I suppose because, in the process of curdling, the milk in great measure disappears and is replaced by curds. The Sthavira Subh\u00fati informs me that the true version of the comment is, Sajjukhiran ti ta\u1e45kha\u1e47am yeva dhenuy\u00e1 thanchi dhovitv\u00e1 gahitakhiram, na muceatiti na parinamati na pakatibh\u00e1van jahati na dadhibh\u00e1van \u00e1pajjati, \u201cSajjukh\u00edra means milk just drawn from the previously washed udder of the cow; na muceati means that it does not change, does not leave its original state, does not turn into curds.\u201d This explanation makes sajju not an independent word qualifying the sentence na hi p\u00e1pam katan kamman muceati, but the first part of a compound word sajjukkhira, meaning \u201cnew milk.\u201d It is a satisfactory solution of the difficulty, and the sense of the whole verse would be, \u201cAs newly drawn milk will not curdle for a long while, as fire covered by ashes goes on smouldering for a long while, so it takes a long while to get rid of the consequences of an evil action.\u201d\n\nOf course in a translation the play upon the two meanings of muceati is lost, and the simile is deprived of most of its force. It is worthy of notice than in the Sinhalese Prakrit mid, the equivalent of muc, means, according to Clough, \u201cto loosen, to release,\u201d and also \u201cto congeal, to coagulate.\u201d\nVerse 252. Sudassam vajjam a\u00f1\u00f1esam attano pana duddasam\nParesan hi so vajjani opunati yath\u00e1 bhusam\nAttano pana ch\u00e1deti kalim va kitav\u00e1 satho.\n\n\"The faults of others are easily seen, our own are difficult\nto see; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like chaff, his\nown he keeps out of sight as the fraudulent gambler hides\nhis loaded dice.\" Fausb\u00f6ll translates yath\u00e1 bhusam, \"as much\nas possible,\" taking it as a compound word, the equivalent of\nwhich would be yath\u00e2bhri\u00e7am in Sanskrit. But bhusa in\nP\u00e1li means also \"chaff,\"\u00b9 and the use of opunati almost\npositively demands that yath\u00e1 bhusam should be translated\n\"like chaff.\" The commentator takes this view in the most\ndecided and unmistakable manner, for he says bhusam opu-\nnanto viya opunati, \"winnows them like one winnowing chaff.\"\nThe force and beauty of the metaphor is obvious enough.\n\nVerse 257. I do not see how dhammassa gutto can be\nrendered \"custos legis,\" since gutta (gupta) is used only in a\npassive sense. I would translate the passage, \"The wise man\nwho is guarded by justice (or by the Law) is called just.\"\nA man guarded by justice would of course mean a man whose\nactions or words are directed by a sense of justice. The\ncomment says dhammagutto dhammarakkhito, which can only\nmean \"guarded by dhanma, kept by dhamma.\"\n\nVerse 272. Dhamm\u00e1r\u00e1ma informs me that the true read-\ning of the last line is bhikkhu viss\u00e1s\u0101 m'\u00e1p\u00e1di appatto \u00e1sa-\nvakkhayam, or rejecting sandhi bhikkhu viss\u00e1sam m\u00e1 \u00e1p\u00e1di\nappatto \u00e1savakkhayam, \"priest, be not confident as long as thou\nhast not attained the extinction of desire.\"\n\nVerse 283. Vanam chindatha m\u00e1 rukkham vanato j\u00e1yati bhayan\nChetv\u00e1 vana\u00f1 ca vanatha\u00f1 ca nibb\u00e1n\u00e1 hottha bhikkhave.\n\n\"Cut down the whole forest, not the tree, danger comes out\nof the forest; when ye have cut down both the forest and\nits undergrowth, then shall ye be free from passion.\" Half\nthe force of this passage is lost in a translation, from the im-\npossibility of rendering the play on the two meanings of vana.\nIt is doubtful whether nibb\u00e1n\u00e1 or nibban\u00e1 (nis+vana) be the\nright reading. Vana\u00b2 means \"desire\" in P\u00e1li as well as\n\n\u00b9 See Abhidh\u00e1nappadipik\u00e1, 453: it is the Sanskrit busa. \u00b2 Abhidh\u00e1n. 163.\nvana, and nibb\u00e1na would not be a participle, but an adjective meaning \"free from v\u00e1na or lust.\"\n\nVerse 344. Subh\u00fati informs me that the true reading is nibbanatho, and the first line means, \"he who having got rid of desire hankers again for desire.\" The readings of Fausb\u00f6ll's three manuscripts are nibbanatho, nibbanato, and nibb\u00e1nato. Mr. Fausb\u00f6ll now agrees with me in thinking that the two last are obvious copyists' errors.\n\nVerse 289. Nibb\u00e1nagamanan\u00f1 maggam khippam eva visodhaye.\n\nThis is an instance of Nibb\u00e1na, meaning both Nirv\u00e2nas. (See my remarks at p. 221).\n\nVerse 331. Tut\u1e6dhi sukha y\u00e1 itaritarena, \"A blessed thing is joy, whatever be the cause.\" Itarituna in P\u00e1li does not mean \"mutual,\" but \"any whatever.\" Thus in the text of one of the Buddhist classifications we have Idh' \u00e1vuso bhikkhu santu\u1e6dtho hoti itaritarena civarena, \"contented with whatever robes he is presented with,\" that is, whether they be of fine or of coarse material. In this verse k\u00e1ra\u1e47ena might be supplied after y\u00e1 itaritarena. The comment says parittenav\u00e1 vipulena r\u00e1, \"caused by a small or a great matter.\" Any one who has seen a child in ecstasies of delight over the veriest trifle will agree that \"a blessed thing is joy, whatever be the cause.\"\n\nVerse 369. Chetv\u00e1 r\u00e1gana ca dosana ca tato nibb\u00e1nam chisi. \"When thou hast rooted out lust and hate then shalt thou go to Nirv\u00e2na.\" Here Skandhapari\u00f1irv\u00e2na or Anupadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u00e2na is intended, for he who has rooted out r\u00e2ga and dvesha is the Arhat (citar\u00e2ga), who \"afterwards\" (tato, or, as the comment says, aparabh\u00e1ge, viz., at the end of the few years he has to live), attains the annihilation of being. The comment distinctly specifies this Nirv\u00e2na to be Anupadhi\u00e7eshanirv\u00e2na: the words are r\u00e1gadosabandhan\u00e1ni chinditr\u00e1 arahattam patto tato aparabh\u00e1ge anupadhisesanibb\u00e1nan\u00f1 chisiti attho, \"having severed the bonds of lust and hate and attained Arhatship, thereafter thou shalt go to Nirv\u00e2na.\" It will be observed that the P\u00e1li equivalent of upadhi\u00e7esha is up\u00e1disesa. This is a compound of sesa (\u00e7esha) with up\u00e1di, a masculine noun formed from the root d\u00e2 \"to take\" with \u00e2 and upa. Up\u00e1di\n\n1 See Dham. p. 466.\nis closely allied with *up\u00e1d\u00e1na*, the more regularly formed derivative of *upa-\u00e2-d\u00e2*, and is used to designate the Five Skandhas. This word is interesting because it is one of the forms which give evidence that the P\u00e1li or southern recension of the Buddhist scriptures is the original one, and that the oldest Sanskrit texts of Northern Buddhism are translations from it, possibly made some time after the P\u00e1li text of the Tripi\u1e6daka had been settled. *Up\u00e1di* is one of the unclassical forms which abound in P\u00e1li, and restore to it so much of the wealth it loses from assimilation and other causes. The final syllable *di* must be formed from *d\u00e2*, on the analogy of *dhi* from *dh\u00e2*. I imagine, then, that the translators of the P\u00e1li religious texts into Sanskrit, meeting with this word, and unable to make anything of it, replaced it by the nearest approach they could find to it in classical Sanskrit, viz., Upadhi.\u00b9 Other instances might be adduced; thus the word *ph\u00e1suvih\u00e1ra* occurs frequently in the P\u00e1li Tripi\u1e6daka with the meaning of \u201clife of ease or happiness.\u201d *Ph\u00e1su* is a P\u00e1li neuter noun, meaning \u201ccomfort, ease, happiness,\u201d the etymology of which I have failed to discover. The author of Saddharmapu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u00edka,\u00b2 meeting with the word *ph\u00e1su*, took it for the equivalent of spar\u00e7a,\u00b3 and rendered the compound *ph\u00e1suvih\u00e1ra* by sukhaspar\u00e7avih\u00e1rata, \u201clife of agreeable contacts.\u201d But *ph\u00e1su* can really have nothing to do with spar\u00e7a, first because its meaning and use are totally distinct from those of spar\u00e7a,\u00b3 and secondly because the regularly formed equivalent of spar\u00e7a, namely *phassa*, is in constant use in P\u00e1li in the sense of \u201ctouch\u201d or \u201ccontact.\u201d Again, the P\u00e1li word *p\u00e1ramit\u00e1*, \u201cperfection,\u201d is formed by adding the suffix *t\u00e1* to *p\u00e1rami*, an anomalously formed derivative of parama.\u2074 The author of Saddharmapu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u00edka probably found the form *p\u00e1rami* very puzzling, for he almost entirely ignores it, and employs the longer form *p\u00e1ramit\u00e2*, which he takes to be a\n\n\u00b9 Upadhi is used also in P\u00e1li in a metaphysical sense, the four *Upadhis* being the Skandhas, the K\u00e1magu\u1e47as, Kle\u00e7a, and Abhisam\u015bk\u00e1ra.\n\n\u00b2 Lotus, p. 425\u20137.\n\n\u00b3 For instance, *ph\u00e1sugamanam*, \u201cpleasant journey,\u201d *phdsukam th\u00e1nam*, \u201ccomfortable quarters.\u201d Besides *ph\u00e1su* is properly an adjective, see Abhidh\u00e1n. p. 16, note.\n\n\u2074 Intr. p. 464. *P\u00e1rami* is a feminine noun, the plur. is *p\u00e1ramiyo*.\ncompound of p\u00e2ra and ita, like p\u00e2ragata. The circumstance that p\u00e1rami is much more frequently used in P\u00e1li than p\u00e1ramit\u00e1, is almost conclusive against this derivation.\\(^1\\) Again, the well-known P\u00e1li word uposatha is simply a contracted form of uparasatha, but the o in the second syllable evidently misled the Sanskrit translators, for the North Buddhist equivalent is uposhadha, which seems to be a sort of compromise between the P\u00e1li form uposatha and the Sanskrit part. perf. pass. uposhita.\\(^2\\)\n\nVerse 295. M\u00e1taram pitaram hantr\u00e1 r\u00e1j\u00e1no dre ca sotthiye\n\nVeyyagghapa\u00f1camam hantr\u00e1 anigho y\u00e1ti br\u00e1hma\u00f1o.\n\n\"The true brahmin goes scatheless though he have killed father and mother, and two holy kings, and an eminent man besides.\"\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that \u00c7\u00e1kyamuni, though never remiss in declaiming against the errors of the Brahmins, adopted the word br\u00e1hma\u00f1a, with all its sanctity and prestige, into his own system, but made it a denomination of the Arhat, or devout Buddhist who has attained to final sanctification. Buddha even applied the epithet to himself in a Ud\u00e1nag\u00e1th\u00e1, \"hymn of joy,\" he uttered after his attainment of omniscence.\n\nYad\u00e1 have p\u00e1tubhavanti dhamm\u00e1\n\n\u0100t\u00e1pino jh\u00e1yino br\u00e1hmanassa\n\nAth' assa ka\u1e45kh\u00e1 'v' apayanti sabb\u00e1\n\nYato paj\u00e1n\u00e1ti sahetudhamma\u1e41.\n\n\"When the Truth is made manifest to the striving, the meditating brahmin, then his doubts all flee away when he knows existing things and their causes.\" The Br\u00e1hmanavagga of Dhammapada tells us that the true Brahmin is not he who is born of Brahmin parents, but the man in whom passion is destroyed\u2014khi\u1e47\u00e1saram arahantam tam aha\u1e41 br\u00fami br\u00e1hmanam.\n\nBut to return to our verse: Fausb\u00f6ll thinks the sentiment it conveys inconsistent with Buddhist doctrine, though quite in accordance with the Brahminical system. This, however, is on the assumption that the word br\u00e1hmana is taken in its natural sense, whereas we have seen that it may perfectly mean an Arhat, and the comment says nikkilesa, which is the\n\n\\(^1\\) See Burn, Intr. p. 464; Lotus, p. 544.  \n\\(^2\\) Lotus, p. 450; Intr. p. 138.\nsame thing. In my judgment this verse is intended to express in a forcible manner the Buddhist doctrine that the Arhat cannot commit a serious sin.\\(^1\\) It is as much as saying, \"An Arhat cannot commit sin, but were he to commit even sins so dreadful as parricide and murder he would be scatheless,\" that is, as Dr. Max M\u00fcller has observed, if he does commit these crimes, it must be by accident, so that no guilt would rest upon him. *Veyyaggha* is a derivative of *vyaggha*, and means, I think, \"an eminent man,\" literally, \"a tigerish man.\"\n\nVerse 302. I think the comment affords a satisfactory explanation of this difficult verse, \"The traveller on the long road of Sams\u00e1ra meets with nothing but pain; painful is the life of the recluse, painful is the life of the householder, painful is association with those who are not our equals: therefore let him travel no more, and so he will not be exposed to suffering.\" That is, let him obtain Nirv\u00e1na, and bring to an end his journey through Sams\u00e1ra. Compare p. 280 of Dhammapada, where it is said that there are two sorts of roads on which a man may be a traveller, *kant\u00e1radhdh\u00e1*, a road though a difficult country, and *vattaddh\u00e1*,\\(^2\\) the road through Samsara.\n\nVerse 368. *Adhigacche padam santam sankharupasamam sukham.*\n\n\"He will attain the tranquil, blessed lot, where existence is no more.\" Here I believe Skandhaparinirv\u00e1na to be intended, as in the verse which immediately follows, and which we have already considered. From a Buddhist point of view there is really no reason why annihilation should not be spoken of as \"blessed,\" or even as \"bliss\"; it is a \"happy release\" from suffering which without it would be endless.\n\nVerse 394. *Kin te ja\u1e6d\u0101hi dummedha kin te ajinasatiy\u00e1 Abbhantaram te gahanam b\u00e1hiram parimajjasi.*\n\n\"Thou fool, what dost thou with the matted hair, what dost thou with the raiment of skin? thine inward parts are full of wickedness, the outside thou makest clean.\" *Abbhan-taram* is a noun, and means \"inner man,\" \"heart.\" It is, I think, best to take *gahanam* as an adjective in agreement with\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Abhabbo khindasavo bhikkhu sa\u00f1cicca p\u00e1nam jivita voropetum*, etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) Vritta, \"the circle of Samsara\" + adhvan.\nabbhantaram, and meaning, choked, filled up, impenetrable from the forest growth of sin; or it might be taken as the noun gahanam,\\(^1\\) \"a forest or jungle,\" \"a thicket.\" The metaphor is the same as at verse 283, where vana means desire or lust.\n\nVerse 396. Bhov\u00e1di n\u00e1ma so hoti, \"he is called Arrogant.\" In the P\u00e1li texts bho is a familiar term of address used to inferiors or equals. The compound bhov\u00e1din would mean \"one who says bho,\" and the comment on this verse says, Bhov\u00e1diti yo pana \u00e1mantan\u00e1disu bho ti ratv\u00e1 vicarati, \"a man is called Bhov\u00e1din who goes about saying Bho when he accosts people or otherwise addresses them.\"\\(^2\\) Brahmins not converted to Buddhism are always represented as saying bho Gotama to Buddha,\\(^3\\) and this address must have greatly jarred upon pious Buddhists, who never spoke to their master but with the highly reverential epithet of Bhante, \"Lord.\" Buddhists therefore in calling Brahmins Bhov\u00e1din meant, I suppose, to imply that they were a proud and haughty class, so proud as to address even the Buddha with familiarity if not disrespect.\n\nVerse 339. Subh\u00fati informs me that the right reading is not man\u00e1passa van\u00e1, but man\u00e1passavan\u00e1, \"flowing in the channels of pleasure.\" Man\u00e1passavan\u00e1 is a compound of man\u00e1pa and savana,\\(^4\\) and is an adjective in the nom. fem., agreeing with ta\u1e47h\u00e1, understood. The comment is man\u00e1pesu r\u00fap\u00e1disu savati pavattat\u00edti man\u00e1passavan\u00e1 ta\u1e47h\u00e1 bhus\u00e1 balavat\u00ed hoti.\n\nVerse 341. Subh\u00fati informs me that sarita is, as conjectured by Fausb\u00f6ll, the part. perf. pass. from \"sara-gatimhi,\" viz., sri. The comment should be sarit\u00e1niti anusarit\u00e1ni pay\u00e1t\u00e1ni. At verse 345 the comment should be s\u00e1rattaratt\u00e1 ti s\u00e1rett\u00e1 hutva ratt\u00e1 balavar\u00e1garatt\u00e1 ti attho.\n\nVerse 129. Upaman is the accusative of the fem. noun upam\u00e1. Att\u00e1nam upamanam katv\u00e1 exactly conveys the idea, \"do as you would be done by.\" The comment says yath\u00e1 ahamp evamp a\u00f1\u00f1e pi satt\u00e1.\n\n\\(^1\\) Abhidh\u00e1n. 536.\n\\(^2\\) A T\u00edk\u00e1 on Kacc\u00e1yana, in the India Office, explains bhov\u00e1di thus: Bho bho veditum sitam ass\u00e1ti bhov\u00e1di, \"one whose custom it is to say bho to people is a bhov\u00e1di.\"\n\\(^3\\) See, for instance, Dham. p. 98.\n\\(^4\\) From sr\u00fa, \"to flow.\"\nART.

How and when a conflict (of the planets) will take place, according to the teaching of the sages who know past, present, and future, has been explained by me in the Astronomical Treatise, after the S\u00fbrya-siddh\u00e2nta.\n\n2. The planets move in the firmament in severally higher and higher orbits, but owing to the great distance they seem, to our sight, to move in the same plain.\n\n3. According to the degree of their (seeming) approachment, there are four kinds of conflicts, as stated by Par\u00e2\u00e7ara and other sages, to wit, cleaving (i.e., occultation), grazing, clashing of the rays, and passing southward.\\(^1\\)\n\n4. At the occurrence of an occultation the rains will fail and discord prevail among friends and powerful families. When planets graze one another, there is danger from the sword, dissension amongst royal councillors, and dearth.\n\n5. At a clashing of the rays there will be war between kings, and desolation by sword, disease, and famine. Likewise there will be hostile encounters between monarchs at the planetary conflict termed passing southward.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Utpala: \u092f\u091a\u094d\u091a \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0941\u092a\u092e\u094d\u092a\u093f\u0915 \u0907\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941 \u091c\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0947 \u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0926\u0903\u0964 \u0905\u0927\u0903\u0916\u093f\u0928\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0927\u094d\u0935\u0902\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930-\u092f\u0924\u094d \u0907\u0924\u093f \u091a\u093e\u0935\u0924\u0965 \u091a\u091a\u094d\u091a \u092f\u0939\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092f\u0939\u0947\u0923 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0930\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0938\u0902\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0903: \u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0938 \u0924\u0942\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0903\u0965 \u091a\u0943\u0923\u094d\u0917\u094d\u0932\u094b \u0930\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0932\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u092e\u0938\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0928 \u092a\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0926\u0947\u0928\u0903\u0964 \u092e\u0947\u0926\u094b\u0932\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0924\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902\u0938\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0939\u094d\u092f\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f: \u092a\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0926\u0947\u0928\u0903 \u0938\u0902\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e \u092f\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0907\u0935 \u0932\u0932\u094d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0938\u0941\u092e\u0926\u0947\u0928\u092e\u0965 Cf. comment. on S\u00fbrya-siddh\u00e2nta, vii. 18, seq. The apasavyam or asavyam yuddham takes place, when the interval is somewhat less than a degree; at a greater interval there is no conflict at all. This statement of the S\u00fbrya-siddh\u00e2nta is more explicit than our author's; yet it is clear that the asavyam or apasavyam in this chapter is that kind of conflict which occurs at the greatest interval allowable.

The Sun, when standing in the meridian, is (compared to) an ally coming to the rescue; when in the east, he is (like a king) staying in town; in the west, he is (a king) marching off. Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn are always staying in town, and the Moon is always an ally.\n\nThis is not difficult to understand, for the moon leaving, in her eastward course, a planet or star at her own right (i.e. standing north from the planet or star), may be said to make a pradakshi\u1e47a; standing to the south, i.e. leaving a planet or star at her left, she makes an apasavya. Thus apasavya means \u201cfrom the left, at the left,\u201d and, in a special application, \u201cat the south side;\u201d but from this it does not necessarily follow that apasavya originally was simply the opposite of savya, \u201cleft.\u201d Yet it cannot be doubted that they have taken apasavya as the reverse of savya, or, in other words, that apa was understood to mean, not \u201cfrom, from the side,\u201d but \u201cnot;\u201d therefore asavya was considered to be simply synonymous with apasavya. Moreover, savya has got the meaning of \u201cright,\u201d precisely the reverse of its most common acceptation, viz. \u201cleft.\u201d Savya, \u201cright,\u201d e.g. from hands, arms, etc., as opposite to v\u0101ma, \u201cleft,\u201d occurs, e.g. in Brh. Sanh. li. 41; asavya, \u201cleft,\u201d 43. Savya, \u201cright,\u201d also in R\u0101ja\u00e7chhara\u2019s drama of B\u0101lar\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, Act i. 33 (ed.

Not to be confounded with this acceptation of savya is its use in augury. Applied to augural birds, etc., savya is strictly and properly \u201cleft,\u201d but as birds first appearing from the left of the observer move in the direction of his right, and keep him at their own right, savya, \u201cleft,\u201d and pradakshi\u1e47a, \u201cmoving to the right,\u201d imply the same, without being the same.

Skr. Diet. Suppl.\n7. Ketu, Mars, R\u0101hu, and Venus are marching planets. All the planets, when hurt, destroy severally, kings coming to the rescue, marching or staying in town. In case of their being victorious, they bestow victory also upon those of their own class.\n\n8. When a stationary planet is overpowered by another of the same description, then kings keeping the town will kill others in the same predicament. The Sun produces the same effects on marching chieftains, and the Moon on allies; the same applies to stationary and marching planets.\n\n9. A planet is overcome when he is standing south, rough, quavering, retrograding, small, covered, of unnatural appearance, without brilliancy, and colourless.\n\n10. He is termed victorious when he shows signs the reverse of those aforementioned; also, if he be large, glossy, and brilliant, in spite of his standing south.\n\n11. Where two planets at their conjunction are radiant, large, and glossy, there is mutual love; whereas, in the contrary case, they destroy those who belong to their own party.\n\n12. If, owing to the indistinctness of the tokens, it cannot be made out whether a conflict or a conjunction is taking place, the effects concerning the potentates on earth are said to be equally uncertain.\n\n13. When Mars is overcome by Jupiter, the B\u0101hl\u012bkas, chieftains taking the field, and people dependent upon fire, are vexed; the \u00c7\u016brasenas, Kalingas, and S\u0101lv\u0101s suffer from Mars being vanquished by the Moon.\n\n14. Should Mars be defeated by Saturn, citizens (and kings staying in town) are victorious, but the country people cast down; should he be so by Venus, granaries,\u00b9 barbarians, and knights come to grief.\n\n15. When Mercury is beaten by Mars, trees, rivers, ascetics, A\u00e7maka-land, monarchs, the Northerners, and persons initiated for a sacrifice, are to suffer.\n\n\u00b9 The comm. explains \u0915\u094b\u0937\u093e\u0917\u093e\u0930 as \u091a\u094c\u0935\u093f\u0932\u092d\u092f\u093e\u092e \u201ca village not received in fief,\u201d which implies, I suppose, that such a village is exempt from tributes.\n16. In consequence of Mercury being overcome by Jupiter, the barbarians, \u00c7\u00fbdras, thieves, wealthy men, citizens, Trigartians, and P\u00e2rvat\u00eeyas are vexed, and the earth shakes.\n\n17. If Mercury is quelled by Saturn, shippers, soldiers, aquatic products, rich men and pregnant women will suffer; if he is overcome by Venus, fires will rage, and corn, rain-clouds and marching kings be lost.\n\n18\u201319. When Jupiter is overpowered by Venus, the Kul\u00fbtas, Gandharians, Kaikayas, Madras, S\u00e2lv\u00e2s, Vatsas, Vangas, cows and grain, are destroyed; so are the Middle country, sovereigns and kine, when Jupiter is defeated by Mars, and the Arjun\u00e2yanas, Va\u1e63\u00e2tis, Yaudheyas, \u00c7ibis and priests, when the same is vanquished by Saturn.\n\n20. But should Jupiter be overcome by Mercury, then the barbarians, truthful persons, swordsmen and the Middle country, will be ruined, apart from the results following from what has been stated in Chapter XVI. (v. 41.)\n\n21\u201322. When Venus is defeated by Jupiter, an eminent chieftain on march finds his death, discord reigns betwixt Brahmans and Kshatriyas, and the Rain-god yields no rain; the Kosalas, Kalingas, Vangas, Vatsas, Matsyas, the Middle country, eunuchs and \u00c7\u00fbrasenas, suffer severely.\n\n23. In case of Venus being vanquished by Mars, commanders of armies will be slain and kings wage war. If Venus is overcome by Mercury, the P\u00e2rvat\u00eeyas are lost, the cows yield no milk, and there is but little rain.\n\n24. By Venus being defeated by Saturn, foremen of corporations, military men, Kshatriyas and aquatic beings are afflicted; moreover, the general effects (taught) in Chapter XVI. take place.\n\n25. When Saturn is subdued by Venus, the prices rise, snakes, birds, and proud men will suffer; likewise the countries of \u1e6canka\u1e47a, Orissa, K\u00e2\u00e7i and Balkh.\n\n26. The Angas, merchants, birds, cattle, and elephants will suffer, should Saturn be defeated by Mercury; but should he be so by Jupiter, then countries where women are predominating in numbers, the Mahishakas and Scythians, will be afflicted.\n27. Herewith are described the special results of Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, if worsted. The other (general) effects must be determined from Chapter XVI. The more any planet is stricken, the more he will ruin whatever belongs to his department.\n\nChapter XVIII.\n\nConjunction of Moon and Planets or Stars.\n\n1. The Moon, when moving more or less to the north of the stars or planets, i.e. keeping them at her right side,\\(^1\\) brings good to mankind; going at the outside, she is not auspicious.\n\n2. If the Moon stands north from Mars, the P\u00e2rvat\u00eeyas and commanders of powerful armies will conquer, knights and marching kings be cheerful, and the earth rejoice at the multitude of corn.\n\n3. The Moon, when north from her own son (Mercury), brings victory to chieftains keeping the town, and causes plenty, increases the stores of grain, the happiness of the people, and the treasures of the rulers.\n\n4. When the Moon stands at the north of Jupiter, homestaying monarchs, Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and scholars will thrive, as well as justice and the Middle country; there will be abundance of food, and gladness amongst the subjects.\n\n5. The Moon, in moving north from Venus, makes horses, elephants, and hoarders of wealth thrive. Then, also, chiefs on march and warriors will conquer, and the crops prove most excellent.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. ch. xvii. 5, note, and the following lines:\n\n\u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0903  \n\u0928\u091a\u0935\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0923\u0902 \u0935\u093e \u092f\u0926\u093e \u0939\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0924\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092a\u0940\u0964  \n\u0924\u0924\u094d \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0941\u092e\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0947\u0935\u0947\u0924\u094d \u0935\u093f\u092e\u0938\u0941\u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0965  \n\u0928\u091a\u0935\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0923\u0902 \u0935\u093e \u092f\u0926\u093e \u0926\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0923\u094b \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0964  \n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092a\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0938\u0926\u0948\u0935 \u0916\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u092d\u092f\u0932\u091a\u0923\u092e\u0965\n6. Should the Moon leave Saturn at her right, then sovereigns keeping the town will triumph, and the Scythians, B\u00e2hlikas, Sindhians, Pahlavas, and Yavanas be joyful.\n\n7. The Moon profits those chieftains, whether marching or not, those things and countries that belong to the domain of the planet or star to the north of which she happens to move, provided she be unhurt. The same are crushed by her, if she stands south.\n\n8. All the effects announced in case of the Moon standing north from a planet become inverted when she stands south. Herewith are enumerated the Moon\u2019s conjunctions with stars and planets; a hostile conflict between the Moon and planets or stars is wholly out of question.\\(^1\\)\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XIX.**\n\n*The years presided over by each of the Planets, and their results.*\n\n1.

Its subject is treated in the Greek Hor\u0101\u00e7\u0101stra, but Var\u0101ha-mihira judged it to belong rather to the Phalagrantha, i.e., Sanhit\u0101.

The clouds, although bulky in appearance and piled up, yield nowhere rain in great quantity; the corn may shoot out, perhaps, at the boundary, but will wither, and even if it grow up, will be pilfered by others. Kings do not properly attend to their governing duties, bilious diseases prevail, and snakes are raging. Such calamities befall the people, whose crops, moreover, have failed, in a year presided over by Mars.\n\n10\u201312. Enchantment, magic, jugglers, mines, townspeople, singers, writers, arithmeticians, and military men prosper; monarchs wish to exhibit to each other wonderful and pleasant shows in order to make friends; business in the world is carried on honestly; the threefold science of religion is in a perfect state, and human justice is duly administered, as if by Manu himself. Some apply their minds to the knowledge of the highest Word (and Principle), or try to attain the highest rank in the study of logic. To jesters, envoys, poets, children, eunuchs, perfumers, those that live near dikes, water, and mountains, Mercury brings joy, and to the earth abundance of herbs, in a year or month of his own.\n\n13\u201315. Continually many sounds emitted by the priests at the sacrifices go up to heaven, rending the hearts of evil spirits, but gladdening the gods partaking of the offerings. The earth is so provided with excellent grain, so teeming with elephants, horse and foot, so stored with wealth and large herds of kine, and so prosperous owing to the protection of her rulers, that her inhabitants seem to vie with the gods in heaven. The sky is covered with many towering clouds, that refresh the soil by raining, and the exceedingly fertile fields produce plenty of corn, in the happy year presided over by Jupiter.\n\n1 Comm. \u092e\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0928\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u0907\u0926\u0902\u091c\u093e\u0932\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0938\u094d\u092e\u092f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u0915\u0941\u0939\u094d\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0947\u0924\u094d\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0928\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0964\n2 Comm. \u0915\u0947\u091a\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0925\u093e\u092c\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0941 \u092f\u094b\u0917\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u0941 \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0964\n3 Comm. \u0906\u0928\u0940\u091a\u093f\u0915\u0940\u092f \u0924\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0935\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0964 Cf.

Earth is decked with rice and sugar-cane, for the fields are copiously watered by the rain poured from mountain-like clouds; by her numerous tanks adorned with beautiful lotuses, she shines like a woman brilliant with new ornaments. The rulers of the country destroy their powerful enemies amidst the numerous cries of victory resounding in the air. Owing to the protecting care of the kings, the good rejoice and the wicked are put down in the kingdoms where cities and mines are in a flourishing state. At spring-time there is much sipping of sweet wine in company with dear loves, much delightful singing accompanied by flute and lute, much feasting in company with guests, friends, and kinsfolk, and Love\u2019s shouts of triumph are ringing in a year ruled by Venus.\n\n19\u201321. Throughout the course of a year ruled by Saturn the countries are disturbed by unbridled bands of robbers and by many battles, and plundered of cattle and goods; the inhabitants, whose kinsmen have been killed, are sorely crying, and whole families are heavily tried by disease and hunger. The sky shows no clouds, as these are chased by the wind; the soil is covered with heaps of branches torn off; the beams of Sun and Moon are invisible in the firmament, concealed by a dense mass of dust. The reservoirs are without water and the rivers shallow. In some parts the products of the field perish from want of rain; in others they get on (only) after being watered (artificially), as the Rain-god gives but little rain.\n\n22. If a planet is small, with faint rays, standing in his lowest mansion, or overcome, he produces no full effect; in the contrary case, he causes great prosperity. The evil effects of a month increase in an evil year; the same applies to the good effects; should the one neutralize the other, then the results are trifling.\n\n1 The compound \u0926\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0903 is irregular, inasmuch as it ought to be \u0935\u093f\u0928\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0903.

In any quarter where all the planets together either appear or set heliacally, will be danger from the raging of the sword, from famine, and calamities.\n\n2. The configurations termed discus, bow, triangle, staff, town, dart, and thunderbolt, bring famine and drought to mankind, and promote war.\n\n3. In any quarter where a cluster of planets is seen at sunset, there will be another king and great calamity from foreign hosts.\n\n4. When planets come together in one asterism, they will be fatal to the people standing under that asterism\u2019s influence,\\(^1\\) but auspicious to the same if they shed bright rays and do not occult one another.\n\n5. I shall now describe the tokens and effects of the (six) constellations, called planetary concourse, gathering, tarnishing, meeting, encounter and fellowship.\\(^2\\)\n\n6. The conjunction of four or five planets, marching or stationary, in one asterism, is styled a \u201cconcourse.\u201d If combined with a comet or R\u0101hu, it becomes a \u201ctarnishing.\u201d\n\n7. When a stationary planet comes together with another stationary planet, or one on march with another of the same description, the conjunction is named a \u201cmeeting.\u201d When another accedes to the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, there is a \u201cfellowship.\u201d\n\n8. One (of two planets in conjunction) rising (heliacally) from the south, and the other doing so from the east, make an \u201cencounter.\u201d In a \u201cgathering\u201d\\(^3\\) the planets are auspi-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) According to ch. xiv. and xv.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ko\u1e63a, \u201cfellowship,\u201d especially secret fellowship, or the German Br\u00fcderschaft, also R\u0101jatarangi\u1e47\u012b 5, 325; p\u012btako\u1e63\u0101\u1e25 are those who have drunk the cup of secret fellowship.\n\n\\(^3\\) The definition is simply omitted.

Since food is the world's life and dependent upon the rains, the setting in of the rainy season deserves to be carefully investigated.\n\n2. Having read the works composed by Garga, Par\u00e2\u00e7ara, K\u00e2\u00e7yapa, V\u00e2tsya,\u00b9 and other sages, in which the symptoms of the future setting in of the rains are described, I now proceed to treat this subject.\n\n3. The prediction of an astrologer who day and night attentively watches the signs of the pregnancy of the clouds, will prove true like that of a sage, when he determines the fall of rain.\n\n4. Indeed, is there any science that could surpass this, by knowing which one becomes a seer of past, present, and future, even in this time of perdition, the Iron Age?\n\n5. Some\u00b2 say that the days of pregnancy begin after the end of the light half of K\u00e2rttika. This, however, is not the opinion of the majority. I will tell Garga's opinion.\n\n6. In the (first) days after the first of the light half of M\u00e2rga\u00e7\u00eersha, or at the time of the Moon's conjunction with P\u00fbrva-Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2 (after that date), the symptoms of the pregnancy of the clouds ought to be observed.\n\n\u00b9 Another reading has Vajra.\n\u00b2 Comm. \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0938\u0947\u0928\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0903 || \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0938\u0947\u0928\u0903\n\u0936\u0941\u0932\u094d\u0915\u092a\u091a\u092e\u0924\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0902 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0947\u0937\u0941 \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930\u092f\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0964\n\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092d\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d \u0938\u0916\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0915\u092e\u094d\u0964\n7. The foetus formed during the Moon's stay in a particular asterism will be born 195 natural days hence, the Moon standing again in the same asterism, according to the laws of her revolution.\n\n8. The foetuses of the light half come out in the dark half, those of the dark in the light half, those of day-time at night, of night at day-time, of evening twilight at dawn, of dawn at twilight.\n\n9. The foetuses from M\u0101rga\u015b\u012brsha and the light half of Pausha are of little consequence. The dark fortnight of Pausha corresponding to the time of conception, the light half of \u00c7r\u0101va\u1e47a may be fixed upon as the period of birth.\n\n10. The foetuses from the bright half of M\u0101gha are born in the dark fortnight of \u00c7r\u0101va\u1e47a. The former part of Bh\u0101dra-pada may be fixed upon as the period of birth corresponding to the dark half of M\u0101gha.\n\n11. The foetuses conceived during the bright fortnight of Ph\u0101lguna are to come out in the latter half of Bh\u0101drapada; but those from the dark fortnight are born in the former half of \u0100\u00e7vayuja.\n\n12. The foetuses from the light fortnight of \u0100\u00e7vayuja will be produced as rain in the dark half of \u0100\u00e7vayuja; those coming into existence during the dark part of Caitra fall down as rain in the light half of K\u0101rttika.\u00b9\n\n13. The cloud embryos formed in the eastern quarter will issue in the west, those formed in the west will issue in the east. In like manner the other directions and the winds are reversed (at the two periods compared).\n\n14.

A rainbow, rumbling of thunder, lightning, a mock sun, beautiful twilight, troops of birds and wild deer emitting auspicious sounds from the north, north-east, or east;\n\n17. The planets large, beaming brightly, moving at the north (of the asterisms) and unhurt; trees with shoots unimpaired; men and quadrupeds merry:\n\n18. Such are the general symptoms announcing the prosperous development of all rain-embryos. There are, however, some special rules arising from the particular nature of the season, which I am about to propound forthwith.\n\n19. (Good symptoms are:) In the months of M\u00e2rga\u00e7\u00eersha and Pausha a red glow of the horizon at morn and evening, clouds and halos, not too severe a cold in M\u00e2rga\u00e7\u00eersha, and not too much snow in Pausha.\n\n20. Happy tokens in M\u00e2gha are: a strong wind, a sun or moon dim by hoar frost, great cold, and a sun rising or setting with clouds.\n\n21. In Ph\u00e2lguna are auspicious: a rough, violent gale, thick clouds showing a smooth surface, halos broken off, and a russet or red sun.\n\n22. In Caitra foetuses forming among wind, clouds, rain and halos are of good augury; in Vai\u00e7\u00e2kha, such as are attended with clouds, wind, rain, lightning, and thunder are favourable.\n\n23. Clouds that at the period of embryo formation show the colour of pearl or silver, or the hue of Tamal, blue lotus or collyrium, or those that resemble aquatic animals, contain copious rain.\n\n24. Clouds shone upon by sharp sunbeams and riding on a soft breeze will, at the time of birth, pour out water, as if with a vengeance.\n\n25, 26. The signs of the miscarrying of the foetuses are meteors, thunderbolts, dense dusk, red glow of the quarters, earthquake, Fata Morgana, opaceous wedges (appearing on the Sun's disc), comets, planetary war, tornados, a porten-\ntous rain of blood or the like, a cloudy bar crossing the Sun's disc, a rainbow, an eclipse: by these and similar portents of three kinds\\(^1\\) an embryo gets destroyed.\n\n27. Signs precisely the reverse of those, both general and special for any particular season, by which the growth of an embryo is assured, produce the contrary results.\n\n28. A foetus commencing its development at (the Moon's standing in) the first and second Bhadrapad\u0101, first and second Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101 and Rohin\u012b, in whatever season it may happen, will yield much rain.\n\n29. An embryo formed at \u00c7atabhishaj, A\u00e7lesh\u0101, \u0100rdr\u0101, Sv\u0101\u1e6di and Magh\u0101 is said to occasion fertility for many days, if unimpaired; but it will be disastrous, if hurt by portents of three kinds.\n\n30. Foetuses coming into being at (the Moon's conjunction with) one of the aforesaid asterisms during the months of M\u0101rga\u00e7\u012brsha, Pausha, and the four following, will produce rain (after 195 days) for eight, six, sixteen, twenty-four, twenty, and three days severally.\n\n31. If the asterism is occupied by an evil planet, the embryos will result in hail, thunderbolts, and rain of fishes; but if the Sun or Moon be in conjunction with or looked at by a benign planet, in copious showers.\n\n32. Too much rain, without apparent cause, at the forming of foetuses, tends to their destruction; if the quantity of rain fallen (as measured in a basin used for the purpose)\\(^2\\) exceeds an eighth of a Dro\u1e47a, the foetus gets dissolved.\n\n33. If a foetus, prosperous in other respects, is, at the time of birth, prevented from producing rain in consequence of planetary and other evil influences, it will (afterwards) give rain mixed with hail, and that at the same period as when it first developed.\n\n34. As the milk of the milch cow grows hard, if retained too long, so does the water, kept back beyond its time.\n\n35. An embryo, if attended with five phenomena,\\(^3\\) will\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) To wit, celestial, atmospheric, and terrestrial; cf. ch. xi. 2; xlvi. 2.\n\n\\(^2\\) See ch. xxiii. 2.\n\n\\(^3\\) Viz. wind, rain, lightning, thunder, and clouds; see ver. 37.\nextend its rain over a hundred yojanas, and for every phenomenon less, over half the extent of the former,\\(^1\\) but, if it has only one concomitant, over five yojanas around.\n\n36. The quantity of rainfall will at the season amount to a Dro\u1e47a (in basin measure), if the embryo has five concomitants; three \u0100dhakas are the results of wind, six of lightning, nine of clouds, twelve of thunder.\n\n37. An embryo has five concomitant signs, if it develops amidst wind, rain, lightning, thunder, and clouds. Such a one brings much rain. One which at the time of formation loses too much water, produces at the period of birth a drizzling rain.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXII.**\n\n*Pregnancy of the Air.*\n\n1. The eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh days of the bright half of Jyaish\u1e6dha are the days of the air\u2019s pregnancy, which are auspicious if the breeze is gentle and favourable, and the sky covered with smooth clouds.\n\n2.

For eliciting this meaning he must have recourse to the quite fanciful and unwarrantable supposition that erire implies, though not formally expresses, a causative sense. But it is sufficiently clear that garbh\u0101tvam er is only a variation of such common expressions as garbh\u0101tvam \u0101y\u0101, \u0101gam, \u0101pad, or y\u0101, gam, or upay\u0101, upagam, etc. Garbh\u0101tvam erire is, according to English idiom, simply, \u201cthey became garbhas.\u201d The Maruts become garbhas again, in other words, \u201cretire to their place of birth\u201d (mythologically, Pri\u1e63\u1e47i\u2019s womb, e.g. R.

The four days mentioned are lucky if uniform, but bode no good if varying, in which latter case they are stated to bring danger from robbers. Let me quote the following stanzas of Vasish\u1e6dha\u2019s:\n\n4. \u201cSuch days of pregnancy as are accompanied by lightning, trickling drops, masses of dust and wind, the Sun and Moon being overcast, contain in them the germs of happiness.\n\n5. And when most splendid flashes of lightning keep near the good regions (viz. north, north-east, and east), then also the discriminating observer may announce the prosperous growth of all products of the field.\n\n6, 7. A rain of dust and water; gentle motions of young children; good-sounding notes of birds and their frolicking in dust, water and the like; halos, sleek and not too much impaired, round the Sun and Moon: from such signs is to be anticipated with certainty a (future) rain promoting the growth of all products of the field.\n\n8. If the clouds are sleek, compact and tending to turn from east to south, there will be a plenteous rain, causing the full development of all crops.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXIII.**\n\n*Prognostics for the Quantity of Rainfall.*\n\n1. From the quantity of rain falling at (the Moon\u2019s conjunction with) P\u016brva-Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, etc., directly after the day of full moon of Jyaish\u1e6dha, should be told by the experts the\n\n\\(^1\\) Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, agreeably to its grammatical form, properly means \u201cbearing\u201d and \u201cwomb,\u201d but in the same manner as racan\u0101, properly \u201ccomposing,\u201d has got the passive notion of \u201ccomposition,\u201d so dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101 may have been taken in the passive sense of \u201cwhat is borne.\u201d In no other way can I account for its construction with parisruta, which applies also to receptacles, wombs; but in this instance dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101 hardly denotes that which contains the embryo.\nquantity of water (to be expected) during the rainy season, along with the good or evil omens.\n\n2. The quantity of water must be determined by taking a basin, a hasta (cubit) in diameter, for hydrometer. Fifty Palas are equal to one \u00c2dhaka, by which standard the water that has fallen is to be measured.\n\n3. The prognostication of the quantity of rain is to begin as soon as there has been rain sufficient to make impressions in the soil\\(^1\\) or leave drops on the grass sprigs.\n\n4. Some say (that the measure is to be taken), whatever may be the extent of land rained upon;\\(^2\\) others propose a region of ten yojanas around;\\(^3\\) the opinion of Garga, Vasishtha and Par\u00e2\u00e7ara is that the circle shall be one of twelve yojanas at the utmost.\\(^4\\)\n\n5. Generally it will rain again (in the season) at (the Moon\u2019s conjunction with) that same particular asterism (P\u00fbrva-Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, etc.), at which some (previous) rain has been falling.

On the top of the mountain where the gods have their abode, the parks of which resound with the humming of the bees upon the blossoms of the trees grown in the dells of the golden hills, and ring with the bustle of many birds and the sonorous notes of the song of Heaven\u2019s nymphs,\u2014there it was that Brhaspati told the matters concerning the Moon\u2019s conjunction with Rohin\u00ee. Having duly taken cognizance of them, as well as of those taught by Garga, Par\u00e2\u00e7ara, K\u00e2\u00e7yapa and Maya to the crowds of their pupils, I shall attempt to treat of the same subject in a (comparatively) short composition.\n\n4. It is by observing Rohin\u00ee in conjunction with the Moon in the dark half of Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, that the astrologer must predict weal or woe, according to the teachings of authoritative works.\n\n5. How a future conjunction can be foretold has been shown by me in my Treatise under the head of \u201cConjunction with Fixed Stars.\u201d The practical results, however, must be set forth as deduced from the Moon\u2019s (apparent) size,\nbrightness, colour, road, and also from omens and the direction of wind.\n\n6, 7. The divining Brahman, going to a spot north or east from the town, staying there three nights,\\(^1\\) attentive to the holy fire, is to draw a diagram of the planets and cluster of asterisms, and worship them by oblations with incense and flowers. He must occupy the sacred plot strewn with sacrificial grass, and adorned, at the four quarters, with vessels kept clean, and not blackened at the bottom, filled with gems, water, and herbs, and covered above with sprouts of trees.\n\n8. After taking all sorts of seeds, while delivering the Mah\u0101vrata prayer, and putting them in a pot, he must immerse them in the water mixed with sacrificial grass and gold. Thereupon an offering with prayers to the Maruts, Varu\u1e47a and Soma (\\(i.e.\\) the Moon).\\(^2\\)\n\n9. He should prepare a thin, black streamer, four hastas (cubits) long and three times as much raised above the ground. Having first ascertained the precise direction of the quarters, he should by means of that instrument observe the wind during the Moon\u2019s conjunction.\n\n10.

Or the sky is studded, as it were, with variegated clouds fair as the calix of the expanded lotus and tinged at the outer edges by the gleam of the morning sun, or showing the dark lustre of bees, saffron, the blossom of \\textit{Butea frondosa}.\n\n15. Or the firmament is occupied by gloomy clouds and illumined at the same time by flashing lights and a rainbow, as if it were a forest that, crowded with elephants and buffalos, stands in full blaze.\n\n16. Or the canopy is shrouded by clouds bearing likeness to mounds of collyrium or imitating the brightness of snow, pearl, mussel-shells and moonbeams.\n17. Or it is decked with clouds dark like Tam\u00e2l or bees, and comparable to elephants, having lightning for golden girdles, (white) cranes for prominent tusks, trickling rain for frontal juice, the moving extremities for trunks, the varicoloured rainbow for a banner erected by way of ornament.\\(^1\\)\n\n18. And also when heaps of clouds, in a sky tinged red by the gleam of dawn and twilight, show the deep hue of blue lotuses, or when they appear to have appropriated to themselves the lustre of Hari (the Sun) clad in yellow.\n\n19. If clouds with (alternately) deep and sharp sounds that blend with the cries of peacocks, c\u00e2taka-birds, and frogs, stretch all over the sky, hanging down to the horizon, they will pour on the earth a flood of rain.\n\n20. If the heavens are occupied by a multitude of such-like clouds as described, during three days, or two, or one day, there will be plenty of rain, abundance of food, and gladness among mankind.\n\n21. Neither good nor rain is to be expected from clouds rough, small, shattered by the wind, noiseless, and resembling camels, crows, spectres, monkeys, or other sinister creatures.\n\n22. The Sun darting fierce rays in a cloudless sky brings rain; so, too, a nightly canopy bright with stars like a lake that, abounding in white lotuses, shines in full bloom.\n\n23. Clouds coming up from east make the field products ripen; those which arise from south-east cause the raging of fires; by those which come from the south, the corn is ruined; by clouds issuing from south-west, the prices go down;\\(^2\\) clouds which originate in the west bring a choice rain.\n\n24. Clouds looming up from the north-west result in a rain seconded by a strong wind, and that only here and there; a thick rain follows upon clouds in the northern region; exceedingly good corn may be expected from clouds gathering to the north-east. The wind, too, in the different quarters, produces similar results.\n\n25.

The water-jars spoken of before, placed north, east, etc., and marked with the names (of the quarters), foreshow the months of \u00c7r\u00e2va\u00f1a, Bh\u00e2drapada, and so forth. If a jar proves full, the month denoted by it will yield rain; if empty,\\(^1\\) there will be no rain; if diminished in volume of water, one must make a calculation in proportion.\n\n27. By means of water-vessels marked with the king\u2019s name, and others marked with the names of the quarters, should be foretold the fortunes (of the king and members of the four classes), in proportion to the pots being broken, empty, diminished, or quite full.\n\n28. If the Moon, while standing on the northern road, either far off or near, makes her conjunction with Rohin\u00ee, one may decisively announce nothing but woe to mankind in every way.\n\n29. If the Moon, trenching on Rohin\u00ee, moves northward, there will be a good rain, but, at the same time, numerous disasters. By entering into conjunction from the northward, without touching, she produces plenteous rain and blessing.\n\n30. Should the Moon take her stand in the midst of Rohin\u00ee\u2019s wain,\\(^2\\) men, having no drink but water from sun-heated vessels, and rendered helpless, run about, the little children begging them for food.\\(^3\\)\n\n31. If Rohin\u00ee goes after\\(^4\\) the Moon-god just rising, then good ensues, and maidens, love-sick, wholly yield to their lovers\u2019 power.\n\n32. Should the Moon-god follow Rohin\u00ee from behind (\\(i.e.\\) from the west), like a wooer his dear love, then men, wounded by Cupid\u2019s shafts, will stand under the sway of womankind.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0938\u0942\u0924 in the text is, of course, a misprint for \u0938\u0942\u0924\u093f.\n\n\\(^2\\) See ch. ix. 25, footnote.\n\n\\(^3\\) This means, in common prose, that there is drought, and in consequence thereof hard times.\n\n\\(^4\\) \\(i.e.\\) if Rohin\u00ee at the Moon\u2019s rising is seen at the west side.

When the Moon stands south-east from Rohin\u00ee, there is to be great calamity; when south-west, the products of the field, smitten by land-plagues, are lost; when north-west, the gathering of grain is middling; when north-east, there are to be many advantages, good growth of the products, higher prices fetched, and the like.\n\n34. It may happen that the Moon touches the junction star, or that she screens it by her disc. At the former contingency they assert the peril to be dreadful; at an occultation, the king is killed by his wife.\n\n35. If at the time of the cows coming home, a bull, or even any black beast,\\(^1\\) takes the lead, there will be much rain; if the animal be black and white, the rain is middling in quantity; and if white, there will be no rain at all. A proportionate estimate (of rain to be expected) is to be made with cattle of other colours.\n\n36. If the Moon, when in conjunction with Rohin\u00ee, is not seen in the overclouded sky, great danger from sickness is imminent, but, at the same time, the earth will be provided with plenty of water and grain.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXV.**\n\n*The Moon\u2019s Conjunction with Sv\u00e2ti.*\n\n1. The same effects as at the conjunction with Rohin\u00ee has the Moon\u2019s conjunction with Sv\u00e2ti and Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, which all of them ought to be observed in the bright half of the month of Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2. How far there is a difference, I am now going to set forth.\n\n2. If it rains in the first part (terce) of night (during the Moon\u2019s stay) in Sv\u00e2ti, all field products will thrive; if in the second part, sesamum, beans, peas; if in the third, there will be summer corn, but no autumnal growth.\n\n3. Rain falling during the first part of the day produces excellent rain (for the future); that which comes in the second part brings the same, but insects and snakes too.\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm. \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0915\u0903.\nModerate rain will result from rainfall during the last part. If it rains both day and night, there will be (afterwards) an uninterrupted rain.\n\n4. There is a star due north of Citr\u0101 (Spica Virginis), called Ap\u0101\u1e43vatsa.\\(^1\\) The conjunction with Sv\u0101ti taking place when the Moon is not far from the said star, is beneficial.\n\n5. If on the seventh day of the dark half of M\u0101gha snow falls, the Moon standing in Sv\u0101ti, or if the wind is vehement, or a rainy cloud is incessantly rumbling; or if the heavens, wherefrom sun, moon, and stars, have disappeared, are scattered over with garlands of lightning, one may be sure that the rainy season will be rich in all sorts of crops, so as to gladden the country people.\n\n[6. In the same manner one must consider the Moon\u2019s conjunction with Sv\u0101ti, when occurring in the month of Ph\u0101lguna, Caitra, or dark half of Vai\u1e63\u0101kha, and particularly in \u0100\u015b\u0101\u1e0dha.]\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXVI.**\n\n*The Moon\u2019s Conjunction with \u0100\u015b\u0101\u1e0dha.*\n\n1. At the time of full moon in \u0100\u015b\u0101\u1e0dha, some seeds, weighed in equal portions, should be kept for a night.\\(^2\\) Such seeds as prove the next day to have increased will thrive; such as have diminished will not flourish.

Each of the two scales \u00b2 should be of linen cloth, six digits long and wide, fastened with four strings. The strings are ten digits long, and the cord by which the balance is held \u00b3 in the midst of the two scales only six digits.\n\n7. In the southern scales must be laid gold and in the northern one the other substances, as well as water. Water from wells, streams and lakes indicate (in prognostication) little, moderate and excellent rain, (severally).\u2074\n\n8. Elephants are indicated (in prognostics) by ivory;\n\n\u00b9 It is not clear by virtue of what function Sarasvat\u00ee is identified with the Balance. Maybe that Sarasvat\u00ee in older times had the attributes of the Greek goddess Themis. To explain the cosmical function of the goddess is no less difficult. Since Tul\u00e2 (i.e. an attribute or part, an\u00e7a, of Sarasvat\u00ee) is the daughter of Aditi (i.e. Not-light), and of the family of Ka\u00e7yapa (i.e. Crepusculum), she may denote the horizon, the limit between day and night; hence the words in v. 3. About Aditi and Ka\u00e7yapa, cf. preface to the text, p. 41. I will add here that Aditi is the same idea as in the later Sanskrit adr\u015b\u1e6da, the unseen, highest power or eternity. It is a general rule that the \u201cunseen\u201d is higher than the \u201cvisible,\u201d the latter being only a part (an\u00e7a) of the former. Therefore K\u1e63\u012bra is higher than Arjuna, though both are essentially the same and inseparable.\n\n\u00b2 i.e. the receptacles wherein the things to be weighed are put.\n\nComm.: \u092f\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0923\u093f \u092a\u0930\u093f\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0935\u0915\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d\u0964\n\n\u00b3 Comm. \u0915\u0935\u093e\u0936\u094d\u091a\u0947\u0928 \u0917\u0939\u0923\u092e\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0924\u0947\u0964\n\n\u2074 Comm. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092f\u0903:\n\n\u0938\u093e\u0930\u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0938\u093f \u0938\u0916\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u094b \u0927\u093f\u0915\u093f\u0964\n\u0928\u093e\u0926\u0947\u092f\u0947 \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0924\u094d \u0915\u0928\u0940\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0935\u091f\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0965\n\u092f\u0938\u093e\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u0917\u094d\u092d\u093f\u0903 \u092d\u0935\u0947\u0928\u093e\u0916\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u092e\u0941\u0930\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0917\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0964\n\u0924\u0938\u093e\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u0917\u094d\u092d\u093f\u0903 \u0935\u093f\u091c\u093e\u0928\u0940\u092f\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e \u0936\u093f\u0935\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u092f\u092e\u0965\ncows, horses and the like by hair from the same animals; kings by gold; Brahmans, Kshatriyas, etc., as well as countries, years, months, quarters of the horizon, by wax.

And when, at the end of summer, a northerly breeze is blowing, fragrant with the sweet-scented flowers of Nau-clea Kadamba, while the sun\u2019s crown of rays is screened by Mount Meru, then the clouds, enraged that by the roaming flashes of lightning all becomes illuminated, will fill, as in a fury, the earth with showers, by which the lunar beams are concealed.\n\n8. When there is a blustrous north-easterly wind, cool, courted by the gods and scented by the blossoms of Punn\u00e2g, agallochum and P\u00e2rij\u00e2ta, then earth, restored to youthful vigour by the abundance of water, will have a profusion of ripe grown corn; the sovereigns will curb their foes and protect the classes of society with the utmost justice.]\n\n\\(^1\\) The poet quibbles upon t\u00e2la, \u201cBorassus flabelliformis,\u201d and \u201cflap, slap.\u201d\nChapter XXVIII.\n\nForetokens of Instant Rain.\n\n1. If in the rainy season the Moon, occupying an aquatic asterism\\(^1\\) of the ecliptic, at the time of prognostication, is on the horizon, or, during the bright month-half, in the fourth, seventh, or tenth mansion, she will presently send forth water, and that in great quantity, if she be looked at by benign planets; in little quantity, if looked at by evil ones. Venus does the same when under the same circumstances.\n\n2. If the person inquiring touches any wet object or water, or anything termed after water,\\(^2\\) or if he stands near water, or is about to do some humid work, or if at the time of consultation the word \"water\" is being heard, the inquirer may be sure that without doubt it is going to rain very soon.\n\n3. When the Sun, in the rainy season, dazzling by extreme splendour, while lingering on the Mountain of Sunrise, shines like molten gold or lustrous beryl, he procures rain on the same day. So, too, when, high in the meridian, he is darting forth most keen rays.\n\n4. The water tasteless, the sky coloured like cows' eyes or crows' eggs, the air serene, moisture of salt, calmness of wind, much tumbling of fishes ashore, repeated croaking of frogs, these are tokens of coming rain.\n\n5. Cats strongly scratching the ground with their nails, rust and a musty smell of iron implements, and dikes made by children in the high road, announce rain to be approaching.\n\n6. Mountains resembling heaps of collyrium, or their cloughs wrapt in vapour, and halos of the colour of cocks' eyes round the Moon, bring rain.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cancer, Capricorn, or Pisces.\n\n\\(^2\\) Comm. gives for examples: \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0916\u093e \u0905\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0932\u0915\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u092e\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0964 The dictionaries only mention \u0905\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941\u092a, Cassia Tora; but pa and p\u0101laka are synonymous, and therefore interchangeable terms.\n7. Ants shifting their eggs\\(^1\\) without mishap, snakes copulating and climbing upon the trees, and cows frisking, are signs of rain.\n\n8. Rain will fall very soon, when the lizards on the tops of the trees keep their eyes fixed upon the firmament, and cows are looking up to the Sun.\n\n9. If cattle are unwilling to leave the house, shaking their ears and hoofs, and similarly dogs, one may state that rain is about to come down.\n\n10. When dogs are standing on the thatches or look steadily up to the heavens, or when lightning at day-time arises from the north-east, the earth\u2019s surface will be levelled by exceedingly much rain.\n\n11. When the Moon is hued like the eyes of a parrot or dove, or honey-coloured, and when a mock-sun appears in the sky, then rain will ere long fall from heaven.\n\n12. When there is thunder at night, blood-red and perpendicular lines of lightning at day-time, and a fresh easterly breeze, rain is at hand.\n\n13. Fall of rain is near, if the shoots of creepers erect themselves aloft, the birds bathe in water and dust, and creeping worms betake themselves to the sprigs of grass.\n\n14. At dawn or twilight clouds showing the same colour as peacocks, parrots, blue jays or c\u00e2taka-birds, or having the lustre of roses and red lotuses, and resembling in shape waves, hills, crocodiles, tortoises, boars, fishes, and piled up with manifold breaks, yield water within short time.\n\n15. Such clouds also as, being white at the ends like stucco or moonlight, lustrously black in the middle as collyrium or bees, with many breaks, sleek, trickling, divided in stairs, issue from the east and move to the westward, or after looming up from the west veer eastward, presently send forth plenty of rain upon earth.\n\n16.

If the sky wears the tinge of francolines' feathers, and the crowds of birds warble forth merrily at sunrise and sunset, day and night, the clouds will pour out rain very soon.]\n\n18. The so-called \"unerring\"\\(^2\\) sunbeams,\\(^3\\) stretched upward like the hands, as it were, of the Mountain of Sunset, and clouds sounding hollow as the ground, are important signs of (instant) rain.\n\n19. If the Moon, during the rainy season, stands in the seventh mansion from Venus, and is looked at by a benign planet, or stands in the fifth, seventh, or ninth mansion from Saturn, there is a tendency to rain.\n\n20. Not unfrequently rain ensues at the planets' heliacal rising or setting, their conjunction, and their entering in a new division,\\(^4\\) or at the end of a half-month, of a half-year, and certainly at the Sun's staying in \u0100rdr\u0101.\n\n21. Rain falls also at a conjunction of Mercury and Venus, of Mercury and Jupiter, and of Jupiter and Venus. From a meeting of Saturn arises peril from wind and fire, unless they are looked at by, or in conjunction with, good planets.\n\n22. When the planets tend to cling\\(^5\\) to the Sun, forward or backward,\\(^6\\) then they will make the earth, as it were, one sea.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXIX.**\n\n*Prognostics from Flowers and Plants.*\n\n1.

The time during which the stars are indistinct, before sunrise and after sunset,\\(^1\\) is the time of dawn and twilight.\\(^2\\) The signs of it, which produce effects, are the following:\n\n2. Wild deer, augural birds, wind, halos, mock suns or moons, cloudy bars crossing the solar orb, tree-shaped clouds, rainbows, Fata Morgana, peculiar solar beams, staffs in the air, dense dust, glossiness and colour.\n\n3. A wild beast, repeatedly uttering loud and horrible shrieks, bespeaks the destruction of a village; being blasted\\(^3\\) by the sun and screaming from the right side,\\(^4\\) he makes the military forces to be slain.\n\n\\(^1\\) The expression in the original is, properly, \u201chaving half set,\u201d i.e. \u201chalf the orb still appearing above the horizon.\u201d\n\n\\(^2\\) Comm. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0903\n\n\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u094b\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092f\u093e \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093f: \u0938\u093e \u091a \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0964\n\u0926\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0902\u0921\u093f\u0915\u093e \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0941 \u092f\u093e\u0935\u0926\u093e \u091c\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0924\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0902\u0928\u092e\u094d\u0965\n\nThe word jyoti, instead of jyotis, is worth being remarked.

Should a great many animals or the wind stand in mixed quarters, during dawn or twilight, then there will be rain.\n\n5. A twilight\\(^2\\) during which wild beasts and birds, vexed, raise cries from the east, bodes the ruin of the land; one resounding with the screams of animals, blasted by the sun, from the southern region, points to the capture of the town.\n\n6. Ill-omened is the twilight, if a strong wind, raising dust and clods, with great noise shakes dwellings, trees, and gateways, and vehemently throws the birds down.\n\n7. Auspicious is the twilight, if animals and birds, unafflicted, send forth soft notes, and if there is no wind, or only a gentle breeze by whose rubbing the foliage of the trees is being slightly moved.\n\n8. Sleek staffs in the air, lightning, fish-like clouds, a mock-sun, a halo, a rainbow, straight lines resembling fragmentary rainbows and distinct sunbeams, at the time of twilight, bring speedy rain.\n\n9. The Sun\u2019s rays being broken off, unequal, dissipated, unnatural, crooked, turned to the leftward, thin, short, crippled, and dimmed, bring war and drought.\n\n10. The Sun\u2019s beams being brilliant, clear, straight, long, turned to the right, in a cloudless sky, tend to the weal of mankind.\n\n11. The bright, distinct, unbroken, straight sunbeams that extend from the horizon up to the midst or over the whole of the heavens, are the so-called \u201cunerring\u201d beams.

Copper-red sunbeams cause the death of a general; yellow and rosy ones, his ill-fortune; greenish-yellow ones, the ruin of cattle and crops; dark purple ones, the loss of kine; madder-coloured rays occasion consternation, owing to the sword and fires; tawny ones, a rain with wind; ashy-coloured ones, drought; spotted and greyish rays\\(^1\\) cause slight rain.\n\n15. If at the time of twilight dust, tinged like the blossom of Pentapetes Ph\u0153nicea, or like collyrium powder, goes up to the Sun, mankind will be afflicted by hundreds of diseases. White dust presages men\u2019s prosperity and bliss.\n\n16. A compound of solar rays, clouds and wind, in the shape of a staff, is called an (airy) \u201cstaff.\u201d If seen in the intermediate regions, it is baleful to monarchs; if in the cardinal points, it is so to Brahmans, Kshatriyas, etc.\\(^2\\)\n\n17.

A dark blue tree-like cloud, with milk-white top, in the midst of the canopy, and screening the Sun, as well as clouds with yellow streaks and big at the bottom, procures much rain.\n\n19.

Dawn in the rainy season being attended with ill-shaped clouds, Fata Morgana, mist, dust and smoke, puts a stop to the rain; in any other season, it occasions the raging of the sword.\n\n22. The natural colour of twilight during the different seasons, to begin with the cold season, is red, yellow, blank, variegated, nelumbium-hued and crimson, each of which is favourable in the proper season. Any deviation from this rule is portentous.\n\n23. A cloud fragment in the shape of a man with a weapon, and tending to the Sun, points to danger from the foe. When a bright airy city (i.e. Fata Morgana) is approached by the Sun, a (beleaguered) town will be taken; when the same is crossed by the Sun, the town will be destroyed.\n\n24. The Sun being concealed by white and far-stretching clouds on the right side\u00b9 bestows rain; so, too, does the Day-god, being covered by clouds resembling tufts of Andropogon grass, and issuing from a quarter not blasted.\u00b2\n\n25. A white cloudy bar through the Sun\u2019s orb at the time of his rising causes disaster to the king; one of bloody appearance occasions the raging of armies; one shining like gold makes armies prosper.\n\n26. Two colossal mock-suns, one on either side of the Sun, bring plentiful rain; but if mock-suns surround the Sun in four directions, there will not be one drop of rain.\n\n27. Clouds at dawn or evening twilight, in the form of banners, umbrellas, rocks, elephants, or horses, bode victory; blood-red ones, a battle.\n\n28. Clouds suspended like heaps of smoke from straw fire, and smooth in appearance, make the armies of monarchs prosper.\n\n29. Clouds at twilight hanging down, or tree-like, or\n\n\u00b9 From the south.\n\u00b2 About \u0926\u0940\u092a and \u0936\u093e\u0932, cf. ch. lxxxvi. 12, and Ind.

A twilight accompanied with the cries of vexed birds, foxes, and wild beasts, with airy staffs, dust, cloudy bars, and the like, or with daily recurring unnatural solar phenomena, foreshows the ruin of land, king, and welfare.\n\n31. Dawn produces its results immediately; evening twilight the same night, or after three days; halos, dust and cloudy bars show their effects either instantly or a week after. The same with solar beams (of peculiar cast), rainbows, lightning, mock-suns, clouds, and wind. Birds do so the same day or that day week; wild beasts in a week.\n\n32. Twilight sheds its gleam (and shows its effects) over one yojana; lightning illumines by its flickering six yojanas; the sound of thunder extends over five yojanas; no limit can be assigned to the falling of meteors.\n\n33. The circle termed a mock-sun shines three yojanas far; a cloudy bar, five; a halo is visible five or six yojanas; the rainbow shows its lustre for ten yojanas.\n\nChapter XXXI.\n\nThe Glow at the Horizon.\n\n1. The glow at the horizon, if yellow, presages peril to the king; if fire-red, the ruin of the country; if rubicund and observed with wind from the left, it occasions the loss of the crops.\n\n2.

Meteors are the dropping fruits of merit enjoyed in heaven, in visible form. They are divided into five kinds: ignescent balls, meteors, thunderbolts, lightning, and (shooting) stars.\\(^1\\)\n\n2. A meteor (in restricted sense) produces its effects in a fortnight; likewise an ignescent ball; a thunderbolt in three half-months; lightning in six days; a (shooting) star the same.\n\n3. Three out of the five phenomena of meteors have full effects, viz., lightning, meteors, and thunderbolts; a shooting star is said to produce the fourth part of the full effect, and an ignescent ball the half.\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e\u0926\u093f\u092d\u093f: \u092a\u0941\u0928\u0930\u094d\u0928\u092f\u0925\u093e \u0915\u0925\u093f\u0924\u092e\u094d \u092f\u0925\u093e \u0932\u094b\u0915\u092a\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u0938\u0941\u092d\u093e\u0937\u0941\u092d\u092b\u0932\u0938\u0942\u091a\u0928\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0923\u093f \u091c\u094d\u091e\u091c\u093f\u0924\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0924\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092c\u093f\u0935\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e:\u0964 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0903:\n\n\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u0941\u092d\u093e\u0937\u0941\u092d\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0926\u093f\u0928\u0903\u0964\n\u0932\u094b\u0915\u092a\u093e\u0932\u093e \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0915\u093e\u092e\u094b \u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u091c\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0924\u0941\u0965\n\n\u0906\u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0902\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0924\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u092e\u094d\n\u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0932\u094b\u0915\u092a\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0932\u094b\u0915\u093e\u092d\u093e\u0935\u093e\u092f \u0938\u0928\u094d\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0935\u0941\u0932\u094d\u0915\u0903\u0964\n\u0915\u0947\u092a\u093e\u091c\u093f\u0924\u0941\u0916\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0902 \u0924\u0935\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0935\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0941\u0924\u093f: \u0916\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0965\n\u0907\u0924\u093f\u0965\n\nThe explanation of these mythological phrases is not difficult. Ulka, in the most common acceptation of the term, is a \u201cshooting\u201d or \u201cfalling star.\u201d Now, the notions of star, ray and darted weapons are generally expressed by the same word. One instance may suffice, viz., the etymological identity of Sanskrit \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d and Greek \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd. Hence an ulka may be called an astrom. The notion of \u201cshooting\u201d or \u201cshot\u201d finds its expression in \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0941\u091c\u0903; that of \u201cfalling,\u201d in \u0935\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0941\u0924\u093f and \u092a\u0924\u094d.\n4. A thunderbolt comes, crackling, down upon men, elephants, horses, wild beasts, rocks, houses, trees, or cattle, at the same time wheeling and rending the surface of the earth.\n\n5. Lightning frightens on a sudden animals by its crackling, moves flaming in wide zigzags, and falls down upon living creatures and faggot piles.\n\n6. An ignescent ball is small, with a short tail,\u00b9 and continues visible over a space of forty cubits or more. It looks like a burning coal, and measures two cubits.\n\n7. A (shooting) star is (apparently) a cubit in extension, and white, red, or of the colour of lotus filaments. It moves in the heavens horizontally, downwards or upwards, as if being drawn.\n\n8. A meteor (in restricted sense) is large at the top, and increases in size in falling, dragging all along behind itself a very thin tail. Its length (the tail included) is three cubits and a half. There are many sorts of it.\n\n9. Such as resemble spectres, weapons, asses, camels, crocodiles, monkeys, boars, ploughs, wild beasts, great lizards, snakes, and smoke, have evil consequences, as well as such as have two crests.\n\n10. Such as appear like banners, fishes, elephants, mountains, lotuses, the Moon, horses, glowed silver, or are shaped like the figures called \u00c7r\u00eevatsa,\u00b2 thunderbolt, conch and cross, bring times of plenty.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 What here is called \"tail\" (puccha), is not to be confounded with the tail, or rather crest (\u00e7ikh\u00fb, \u00e7\u00fbl\u00fb) of a comet. The former is simply a result of optical illusion.\n\n\u00b2 Utpala r. \u00c7r\u00eev\u00fbc, about which he remarks that it is well known, (prasiddha). From other passages it appears that he takes \u00c7r\u00eev\u00fbc to be synonymous with \u00e7\u00eelv\u00fb, \u00c6gle Marmelos. Cf. Weber, Fragment der Bhagavat\u00ee, pp. 306, 312. The compound \u00e7y\u00e2\u00e7\u00eental\u00e7\u00fb\u00e7\u00eent\u00e2\u00e7r\u00ee-\u00e7\u00fbc\u00fbnt, i.e., is an error for \u00e7\u00fb\u00e7\u00eent\u00e2k, I presume; whereas Weber proposes to read \u00e7\u00fb\u00e7\u00eent\u00e2k. The compound is a Bahuvr\u00eehi, and may be rendered \"whose \u00c7r\u00eev\u00fbksha-figure possesses the proper marks.\"\n\n\u00b3 Comm. t\u00e2d\u00e2\u00e7 k\u00e2\u015bya:\n\n\u0928\u0930\u0947\u092d\u0924\u0941\u0930\u0917\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u092e\u0935\u0943\u091a\u0941\u092a\u0941\u091a \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0938\u0926\u093e\u0964\n\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0935\u091f\u094d\u091f\u092f\u093e \u0932\u0918\u0941\u0928\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u0935\u0938\u0902\u092f\u0941\u0924\u093e\u0965\n11. Meteors, dropping in great numbers from the midst of the canopy, are pernicious to king and land. By whirling high in the sky, a meteor presages commotion among mankind.\n\n12. One coming in contact with the Sun or Moon, or issuing from either at the time of an earthquake, causes a hostile invasion, the king\u2019s death, famine, drought, and unsafety.\n\n13. A meteor destroys monarchs staying in town or those on march, according to its passing the Sun or Moon to the right. One dropping from the Sun in front of the traveller brings good.\n\n14. A meteor, being white, ruins the Brahmans; being red, the Kshatriyas; being yellow, the Vai\u1e63yas; and, being black, the \u0100dras. The members of the four castes are also hurt, severally, by meteors falling upon the head, shoulder, side, and behind.\n\n15. A meteor of coarse appearance brings woe to Brahmans, by falling in a northerly direction; in an easterly direction, to Kshatriyas, and so forth. If it appears sleek, not crooked, entire, and is moving low, it tends to the prosperity of the same.\n\n\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0924 \u091a\u093e\u0938\u0915\u0930\u0940 \u092d\u0940\u092e\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0924\u091f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0964\n\u0935\u0943\u0939\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0940\u0937\u094d\u0923\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0938\u0942\u0916\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u091c\u0940\u0935\u093f\u092a\u0941\u091a \u092a\u0902\u0924\u0938\u0926\u093e\u0965\n\u0927\u0928\u0941\u0937\u093f \u0926\u0936 \u092f\u093e \u0926\u0943\u0936\u094d\u092f \u0938\u0942\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0927\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u094b\u092a\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0964\n\u091c\u094d\u091e\u091c\u093f\u0924\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0930\u0938\u0926\u0943\u0936\u0940 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940 \u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0938\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0923\u0903\u0965\n\u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e\u0924\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0915\u0924\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0939 \u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0924\u093e\u0917\u0924\u093e\u0964\n\u0924\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0917\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0927\u094d\u0935\u092e\u0927\u094b \u092f\u093e\u0924\u093f \u0938\u094b\u0939\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0947\u0935 \u0924\u093e\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0965\n\u0909\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e \u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0928\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092a\u0924\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u0941 \u0938\u0930\u0964\n\u0924\u0928\u0941\u092a\u0941\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e \u0928\u0942\u092e\u093e\u091a\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u092c\u091c\u094d\u091c\u0947\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u093e\u0965\n\u0906\u092f\u0941\u0927\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0938\u0926\u0943\u0936\u0940 \u091c\u092c\u0941\u0915\u094b\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0916\u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0903\u0964\n\u0927\u0942\u092e\u094d\u0930\u0918\u094d\u0928\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u092a\u093e\u092a\u093e\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092f\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0965\n\u0927\u091c\u092a\u0926\u094d\u092f\u092d\u093f\u0902\u0938\u093e\u092d\u093e \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924\u093e\u092f\u0938\u092e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0964\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0943\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0938\u0926\u0943\u0936\u093e \u092f\u093e\u091a\u094b\u0932\u094d\u0915\u093e \u0938\u093e \u0936\u093f\u0935\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u093e\u0965\n\nIt is not necessary to point out how closely our author has imitated this passage.\n16. One that is grey, rosy, blue, crimson, fire-red, dusky, or ashy, and rough, visible at dawn or day-time, broken and moving in a crooked way, bodes danger from hostile invasion.\n\n17. In hurting asterisms or planets, a meteor is stated to be disastrous to whatever belongs to their department.\\(^1\\) By dashing against the Sun or Moon at the time of rising or setting, it is deadly for monarchs staying in town or on march.\n\n18. If P\u00fbrva-Phalgun\u00ee, Punarvasu, Dhanishth\u00e2, and M\u00fbla are scathed by a meteor, damsels are to suffer. Brahmans and knights come to grief if Pushya, Sv\u00e2ti, and \u00c7rava\u1e47a are attainted.\n\n19. The (so-called) constant and kind asterisms being hurt, sovereigns are afflicted; the harsh and cruel mansions being struck, thieves are to suffer; whereas artisans will suffer, should the swift and neutral asterisms\\(^2\\) be in the same predicament.\n\n20. By falling upon idols, meteors cause danger to king and land; by coming down upon an image of Indra, they occasion distress to sovereigns; by falling upon dwellings, they bring affliction to the owners.\n\n21. By hurting the planet of a particular region,\\(^3\\) a meteor causes suffering to the people in that quarter. If it comes down on a threshing-floor, agriculturists are to suffer. If it falls on a holy tree, the beings worshipped there are distressed.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) As enumerated in ch. xv. and xvi.\n\n\\(^2\\) Among the asterisms are called constant (\u0927\u0942\u0935): Rohi\u1e47\u00ee, Uttara-Bhadrapad\u00e2, Uttara-Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, and Uttara-Phalgun\u00ee; kind (\u0938\u094c\u092e\u094d\u092f, \u092e\u0943\u0926\u0941): Mrga\u00e7iras, Citr\u00e2, Anur\u00e2dh\u00e2, and Revat\u00ee; harsh (\u0909\u091a\u094d\u091a): Bharan\u00ee, Magh\u00e2, P\u00fbrva-Bhadrapad\u00e2, P\u00fbrva-Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, and P\u00fbrva-Phalgun\u00ee; cruel (\u0926\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0923, \u0924\u0940\u091a\u094d\u091b, \u0915\u094d\u0930\u0942\u0930): \u00c2dr\u00e2, A\u00e7lesh\u00e2, Jyeshth\u00e2, and M\u00fbla; swift (\u091a\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930, \u0932\u0918\u0941): A\u00e7vin\u00ee, Tishya, Hasta, and Abhijit; neutral (\u0938\u093e\u0927\u093e\u0930\u0923, \u092e\u0943\u0926\u0941\u0924\u0940\u091a\u094d\u091b): Krttik\u00e2 and Vi\u00e7\u00e2kh\u00e2. Cf. ch. xciii. 6-11; also Weber, Jyotisha, p. 95; and Naxatra, ii. 385.\n\n\\(^3\\) The planets of the eight regions, east, south-east, etc., are the Sun, Venus, Mars, R\u00e2hu, Saturn, the Moon, Mercury, and Jupiter.\n22. A meteor, if coming down upon a city gate, bespeaks the ruin of the city; if on a bolt, the destruction of the people; if on a shrine of Brahma, it crushes the Brahmans; if on a cow-house, the cow-keepers.\n\n23. If at the moment of a meteor falling are heard such sounds as roaring, claps, instrumental music, song and clamours, they augur danger to the land and its ruler.\n\n24. A staff-like meteor, whose train continues for a long time visible in the sky, is dangerous for the king. So, too, one that appears in the air as though it were drawn by a thread, or one that resembles the banner of Indra.\\(^1\\)\n\n25. By going backward, a meteor ruins head merchants; by going in a horizontal direction, king\u2019s wives; by tending downward, kings; by moving upward, Brahmans.\n\n26\u201328. A meteor shaped like a peacock\u2019s tail brings destruction to mankind; one creeping like a snake, is disastrous to women; a circular one, is fatal to the town; one in the form of an umbrella, to the court priest; one resembling a tuft of bamboo, is noxious to the kingdom. Mischievous also is one that bears a likeness to beasts of prey, or boars, and shows a crown of sparks, or is shattered to pieces, and attended with noise.\n\n29. One that looks like a rainbow, destroys the empire; one that dissolves itself in the heavens, undoes the clouds; one moving against the wind, in a crooked way or backwards, is not auspicious.\n\n30. Danger threatens the king from the quarter from which a meteor is approaching the town or host, but if the monarch marches off to the quarter where a meteor comes down blazing, he will ere long conquer his foes.\n\nChapter XXXIV.\n\nSigns of Halos.\n\n1. Halos consist of solar or lunar beams that, reflected by the wind, take a circular shape and show themselves in a slightly clouded sky in various colours and forms.\n\n\\(^1\\) About the banner of Indra, see ch. xliii.\n2. They are crimson, deep blue, pale yellow, dove-coloured, darkish, speckled grey, greenish yellow or white, according to their being produced by Indra, Yama, Varu\u1e47a, Nir\u1e5bti, V\u0101yu, \u010civa, Brahma, or Agni.\n\n3. Kubera is the author of one having the hue of a peacock\u2019s neck; others produce halos of mixed colours. V\u0101yu\u2019s work also is a halo that ever and anon is fading away, having trifling results.\\(^1\\)\n\n4. A halo shining like the blue jay, peacock, silver, oil, milk, or water, being glossy and entirely round, bestows welfare and plenty, if appearing in its proper season.\\(^2\\)\n\n5. Mischievous is one that extends its course through the whole firmament, shining, variegated or blood-red, rough, broken, having the shape of a cart, bow, or triangle.\n\n6. On the appearance of a halo tinged like the peacock\u2019s neck, follows much rain; of a varicoloured one, the death of the king; of a dark purple one, unsafety; of one coloured as the rainbow or the red \u0100\u00e7oka, war.\n\n7. When there is a glossy, thick halo, which shows the natural colour of the season, and is overcast with stratified clouds, it brings rain on the same day. So, too, does a yellow one, when the Sun is shining fiercely.\n\n8. A huge, hazy halo seen at dawn, noon, or twilight,\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0915\u093e\u0936\u094d\u092f\u092a\u0903\n\n\\(^2\\) Much more perspicuous is the following passage from K\u0101cyapa:\n\nCurious are \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d and \u0936\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0924\u094d, instead of the locative, instrumental, or even accusative case.\nwhile blasted birds and wild deer emit their cries, causes unsafety, and, if hurt by lightning, meteors and the like, it slays the king by the sword.\n\n9. Whenever the Sun or Moon daily, during day and night, looks red, death awaits the sovereign; likewise, when both are repeatedly surrounded by a halo at the time of rising, setting, or noon.\\(^1\\)\n\n10. A halo consisting of two circles is threatening to the commander of the army, though the raging of arms caused by it is not so very violent. Three circles foreshow the raging of the sword; four of them, peril for the prince royal; five of them, the siege of the town.\n\n11. A planet, the moon and a star being inclosed (within a halo, at the same time), there will be rain in three days, or war in a month.\\(^2\\) A halo surrounding the lord of the horoscope, the lord of nativity, or the birth-star\\(^3\\) of the king, is an evil omen for him.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0903:\n\n\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093e \u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0937\u094b \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0940 \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u092f\u0926\u093e \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\u090f\u0915\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0938\u093f\u0927\u094d\u0939\u094b\u0930\u093e\u091a\u0947 \u0924\u0926\u093e \u0928\u0936\u094d\u0928\u0924\u093f \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0935\u0903\u0965\n\u090f\u0924\u0947\u0928 \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0928\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0936 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0939\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0964\n\u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u092d\u0942\u0924\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0936\u0903 \u0916\u093e\u0924\u0903 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0928\u0947\u0965\n\n\\(^2\\) Utpala: \u090f\u0924\u0926\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0937\u092e\u0927\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093f \u092f\u0939\u0928\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u092f\u0926\u093e \u092d\u0935\u0924\u0938\u0926\u093e \u091a\u094d\u092f\u0939\u093f\u0923 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928\u092f\u0947\u0923 \u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u092e\u0947\u0935\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0903:\n\u091a\u0940\u0923 \u092f\u091a\u093e\u0935\u0930\u0941\u0927\u094d\u0927\u0930\u0935\u091a\u0928\u0947 \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e \u0917\u094d\u0930\u0939\u0903\u0964\n\u091a\u094d\u092f\u0939\u093f\u0923 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u094b\u0928\u094d\u0928\u0926\u0903 \u092e\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0926\u093e \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u092d\u092f\u092e\u094d\u0965\n\n\\(^3\\) The lord of the horoscope is the planet presiding over the horoscope; the signs Aries, Taurus, etc., are lorded over by Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Saturn and Jupiter. See Brh. J\u00e2taka, i. 6; Laghu-J\u00e2taka, i. 8 (Ind. Studien, ii. p. 278). The lord of nativity is the sign the Moon is standing in at the time of one\u2019s birth.

Saturn, if shut up within the halo, ruins the lesser grain sorts,\\(^1\\) occasions rain seconded by wind, and destroys trees, plants, etc., along with agriculturists.\n\n13. If Mars happens to stand within the halo, young princes, military commanders and soldiers are defeated, whereas fire and sword are threatening. Should Jupiter be encircled, then court priests, ministers and kings are to suffer.\n\n14. A prosperous condition of ministers, trees and writers, as well as a good rain, are the effects of Mercury being encircled. Distress comes to chiefs on march and sovereigns, and dearth ensues, should Venus be inclosed.\n\n15. Danger owing to famine, fire, mortality, the ruler and the sword, arises from a comet standing within the circle. If R\u0101hu is shut in, there will be danger for the king, danger for unborn children, and sickness.\n\n16. If two planets stand within a solar or lunar halo, one may with certainty expect battles, and if three planets are in the same predicament, danger from famine and drought is announced.\n\n17.

XIV.\u2014On the Origin of the Buddhist Arthakath\u00e1s.\n\nBy the Mudliar L. Comrilla Vijasinha, Government Interpreter to the Ratnapura Court, Ceylon. With an Introduction by R. C. Childers, late of the Ceylon Civil Service.\n\nAbout eighteen months ago I was engaged in preparing an edition of Brahmaj\u00e1la Sutta, and of Buddhaghosa\u2019s commentary upon it which forms the first section of the Suma\u1e45gala Vil\u0101sin\u00ed. Buddhaghosa\u2019s commentary upon Brahmaj\u00e1la Sutta is one of the most important of his writings, since it contains a detailed account of the First General Council, held immediately after Buddha\u2019s death for the purpose of settling the text of the Buddhist Scriptures. Intending to publish this work in the same volume with the Brahmaj\u00e1la which it comments upon, I began, and made considerable progress with, a translation of it. At the very outset I met with a difficulty, in the shape of an historical statement in Buddhaghosa\u2019s introductory verses which seemed in the highest degree improbable and untrustworthy. The first ten stanzas of the introduction run as follows:\n\nKarun\u00e1sitalahadayam pa\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1pajjotavihatamohataman\nSanar\u00e1mara\u00f1okagarum vande sugatan gativimuttan.\nBuddho \u2019pi buddhabh\u00e1vam bh\u00e1retr\u00e1 c\u2019eva sacchikatr\u00e1 ca\nYam upagato gatamalam vaude tam anuttaram dhamma\u1e41.\nSugatassa oras\u00e1nan putt\u00e1nan m\u0101rasenamathan\u00e1nan\nAtthannan pi sam\u016bham siras\u00e1 vande ariyasangham.\nIti me pasannamatino ratanattayavandan\u00e1mayam pu\u00f1\u00f1am\nYam suvihatantar\u00e1yo hutv\u00e1 tass\u2019 \u00e1nubh\u00e1vena,\nDighassa dighasuttankitassa nipunasso \u00e1gamavarassa\nBuddh\u00e1nubuddhasanvanjitassa saddh\u00e1vahagupassassa\nAtthappak\u00e1sanattham athakath\u00e1 ad\u00edt\u00f3 vasi\u00f1atehi\nPa\u00f1cahi y\u00e1 sa\u1e45g\u00edt\u00e1 anusa\u1e45g\u00edt\u00e1 ca pacch\u00e1 pi,\nSih\u00e1ladipam pana \u00e1bhata \u2019tha vasin\u00e1 mah\u00e1mahindena,\nThapit\u00e1 Sihalabh\u00e1s\u00e1ya dipav\u00e1sinam atth\u00e1ya,\nApanetv\u0101 tato 'ha\u1e47 Sih\u0101labh\u0101s\u0101\u1e47 manoraman\u0101 bh\u0101s\u0101\u1e47\nTantinay\u0101nuccavik\u0101\u1e47 \u0101ropento, vigatadosan\u0101\nSamayan avilomento ther\u0101na\u1e47 therav\u0101\u1e47sappadip\u0101n\u0101\u1e47\nSunipunavinicchay\u0101na\u1e47 mah\u0101vih\u0101r\u0101dhiv\u0101sin\u0101\u1e47,\nHitv\u0101 punappun\u0101gatam ath\u0101\u1e47, ath\u0101\u1e47 pak\u0101sayiss\u0101mi\nSujanassa ca tu\u1e6d\u1e6dhatth\u0101\u1e47 cirat\u1e6dhitattha\u1e47 ca dhammassa.\n\n\"I make obeisance to Him whose heart is tempered with mercy, in whom the darkness of error is dispelled by the lamp of wisdom, the teacher of the world with its men and angels, the welcome Being who is released from the bonds of existence.\u00b9 I revere the spotless and perfect Truth, by contemplating which, beholding it face to face, the Enlightened attained to perfect knowledge. I bow my head before the holy Church, that congregation of eight orders of men, true sons of Buddha, who have trampled on the hosts of sin. While thus with a heart full of faith I render honour to the Three Jewels, if there be any merit in the deed, by the virtue thereof may all dangers be averted from my path. The commentary intended to explain the meaning of the noble Long Collection, that scripture distinguished for its long discourses, subtle of meaning, praised by Buddha and his apostles, possessed of the qualities that sustain faith,\u2014the commentary, I say, upon this Scripture was at the first Council rehearsed by five hundred holy elders, and in later times rehearsed again and yet again.\u00b2 And it was carried by the saintly Mahendra to the island of Ceylon, and for the sake of the dwellers in that isle translated by him into the Sinhalese language. And now rejecting the Sinhalese tongue, adopting the graceful language that accords so well with the order of Scripture, not contradicting the faultless conclusions of the elders of the priesthood who dwell at the Great Monastery,\u00b3 who are bright lights in the apostolic succession, men of skilful and subtle judgment,\u2014for the edification of righteous men, and to the end that religion may\n\n\u00b9 Released from the five Gatis or states of existence, i.e., existence as a deva, as a man, as a preta, as an animal, or as one suffering in hell.\n\u00b2 Viz., at the 2nd and 3rd Councils.\n\u00b3 In Ceylon.\nlong endure, I proceed to expound the meaning of my text, omitting all unnecessary repetitions.\"\n\nWe find here a distinct statement that a commentary on that portion of the Buddhist Canon which contains the Brahmaj\u0101la was rehearsed, and its text settled, at the First Council; so that, unless some explanation of the passage be found, we must suppose that Buddhaghosa, the Augustine of Buddhist divines, believed that a commentary on Buddha's sermons actually existed during Buddha's lifetime, and that its text was settled immediately after his death. After vainly endeavouring to solve the problem, I wrote to my friend Mr. J. F. Dickson, of the Ceylon Civil Service, and asked him whether he could obtain for me from any of his native friends a satisfactory, or at any rate a probable, explanation of the difficulty. After a long delay I received from Mr. Dickson, on the 15th of April, a paper on this subject by a Sinhalese native gentleman which seemed to me so able and scholar-like, that, although it was only intended for my perusal, I lost no time in obtaining permission to publish it in this Journal. A singular interest attaches to this essay from the circumstance that it is the work of a liberal Buddhist. I print it unaltered, only transliterating the P\u0101li citations.\n\nR. C. Childers.\n\nOn the Suman\u0101gala Vil\u0101sini, and its allusions to an ancient \u0100\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101.\n\nIt must be admitted that the point raised by Mr. Childers is one of grave importance as affecting the credibility of Buddhaghosa and the authenticity of all the commentaries on the Tipi\u1e6daka. From a missionary point of view, the astounding statement that a commentary on Buddha's discourses existed during his lifetime, and was rehearsed along with those discourses at the First Great Council, appears so improbable and unnatural as at once to justify one in discrediting the testimony; and I doubt not that missionary orientalists will hail the discovery as a valuable addition\n\n1 Immediately after Buddha's death.\u2014R. C. C.\nto their stock of arguments against the genuineness and authenticity of the Buddhist Scriptures. Indeed I found it difficult at first to obtain the opinions of some of my learned friends of the Buddhist priesthood on this point, as they seemed to regard it as another thunderbolt intended to be levelled against their religion by some enthusiastic missionary; and it was only after explaining to them the object of the inquiry, and the literary character of the gentleman who started the apparent difficulty, that I could induce them to look the question fairly in the face.\n\nI am glad to say that most of my clerical Buddhist friends with whom I have consulted on this subject agree with me on the necessity of giving a wider and more extended signification than is generally allowed to the word Atthakath\u00e1 as applied by Buddhaghosa in the passage cited.\n\nThe word, as is well known, is compounded of two terms, attha, \"meaning,\" and kath\u00e1, \"a statement, explanation, or narrative,\" the dental t being changed to the cerebral by a latitude in the rules of permutation.\\(^1\\) The literal meaning of the compound term would thus amount to simply \"an explanation of meaning.\" Taking this wider sense of the word as a basis for the solution of the problem, I think the statement of Buddhaghosa in his preface to the commentary on the D\u00edgha Nik\u00e1ya is not so hopelessly irreconcilable with probable and presumable facts as would at first sight appear. On a careful perusal of the two accounts given by Buddhaghosa of the proceedings of the three famous Councils in the Suman\u00e1gala Vil\u00e1sin\u00ed and the Samanta P\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1, this view will, I think, be found to be very reasonable. It must be admitted that no actual commentary, in the sense that the westerns attach to that term, and like that which has been handed down to us by Buddhaghosa, existed either in the lifetime of Buddha or immediately after his death. The reasons adduced by Mr. Childers, apart from others that can easily be added, against such a supposition, are overwhelmingly convincing. But if we suppose that by the word\n\n\\(^1\\) Attho kathiyati etdy\u00fati atthakath\u00e1, thakdrassa thak\u00e1ram katv\u00e1 dukkhassa pilanattho ti \u00e1disu viya.\u2014Tik\u00e1 of Samanta P\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1.\nAtthakath\u00e1 in his preface Buddhaghosa only meant to convey the idea that at the various Councils held for the purpose of collocating the discourses and sayings of Buddha, the meanings to be attached to different terms\u2014chiefly those that appear to have been borrowed from the Hindu system of ascetic philosophy\\(^1\\)\u2014were discussed and properly defined, then the difficulty of conceiving the contemporaneous existence of the commentaries and the Pi\u1e6dakas would be entirely removed.\n\nThis view of the subject will appear still further borne out if we briefly glance over the history of the First Convocation, as narrated by Buddhaghosa himself. The first proposal to hold an assembly of priests for the purpose of collocating Buddha\u2019s discourses was made by Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, the chief of the seven hundred thousand priests who assembled at Kusin\u00e1ra to celebrate the obsequies of the departed saint. Seven days had hardly elapsed after that mournful occurrence, when signs of discontent at monastic restraint manifested themselves, and a disaffected disciple of Buddha named Subhadda openly proclaimed that now their master was no more the ties of discipline should be relaxed, if not broken. The words of consolation offered by this old monk to his brethren in distress are certainly remarkable, as it would be difficult to say whether they betoken more the callousness of his feelings or the depravity of his heart: \u201cBrethren, enough of this sorrow, weep not, lament not. We are well rid of that Arch-priest, having been in constant dread of his declarations, This befits you, this befits you not. Now, therefore, what we desire we shall do; what we do not desire that shall we not do.\u201d\\(^2\\) To a sagacious mind like that of Mah\u00e1 Kassapa it was not difficult to perceive what language like this foreshadowed, and he instantly formed the resolve to congregate the priesthood, and to collect and arrange the laws and doctrines proclaimed by his Master. Hardly two months had elapsed\\(^3\\) before this active mind brought about\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See note A.\n\n\\(^2\\) Alam \u00e1uso m\u0101 socittha m\u0101 paridevittha, upad\u016bta ca homa \u201cidam vo kappati idam vo na kappatiti,\u201d id\u0101ni pana mayam yam icchiss\u0101ma tam kariss\u0101ma yam na icchiss\u0101ma tam na kariss\u0101ma.\u2014Samanta P\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101.\n\n\\(^3\\) See note B.\nwhat it had contemplated, and the result was the Council of the Five Hundred, convoked at R\u00e1jagaha, under the auspices of King Aj\u00e1tasattu, for the purpose of collecting and arranging the doctrines and discourses of Buddha.\n\nThe proceedings of this Council appear to have been conducted in a very orderly and systematic manner, which is the more surprising when we consider that monastic autocracy was about to give place to a form of church government prescribed by the great Founder himself, but which was now to be established and tested for the first time. Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, whom Buddha indirectly indicated as his equal in point of superhuman mental acquirements,\\(^1\\) assumed the office of Moderator, and by the unanimous consent of the synod Up\u00e1li was elected as the best qualified of their order to repeat the Vinaya, and \u0100nanda the Dhamma; the Council having previously decided that the Vinaya was the most material for the permanence of Buddhism. Now it is important to observe that the catechetical form was used in the collocation of both the Laws and Doctrines. \"Afterwards Mah\u00e1 Kassapa, having seated himself in the presidential chair, questioned the venerable Up\u00e1li respecting the Vinaya in this wise. Brother Up\u00e1li, where was the first P\u00e1r\u00e1jika promulgated? My lord, at Ves\u00e1li. On whose account? On account of Sudinna, the son of Kalanda. With regard to what offence? To fornication. Then did the venerable Mah\u00e1 Kassapa question the venerable Up\u00e1li on the offence, the cause, the offender, the primary law, the secondary law, the transgression and the non-transgression, relating to the first law enacted against mortal sin. And the venerable Up\u00e1li explained as he was questioned.\"\\(^2\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Aham bhikkhave y\u00e1vad eva dka\u00f1kh\u00e1mi vivicc 'eva k\u00e1mehi-Fe-pathamam jh\u00e1nam upasapajja vihar\u00e1mi Kassapo pi bhikkhave y\u00e1vad eva dka\u00f1khati-Fe-viharati.\u2014Samanta P\u00e1s\u00e1dik\u00e1.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tato Mah\u00e1kassapo ther\u00e1sane nisidit\u00e9ya dyasamantam Up\u00e1lim vinayam pucchi, pathamam \u00e1vuso Up\u00e1li p\u00e1r\u00e1jikam kattha pa\u00f1\u00f1attan ti, Vesaliyam bhanie ti, kam drabbh\u00e1ti Sudinnam Kalandaputtam drabbh\u00e1ti, kasmin vatthusmin ti, methuna-dhamme ti.

Though it is subsequently added that \u201cat the conclusion of the questions and answers the five hundred Arhats repeated the texts together in the order in which they had been collocated,\u201d\u00b9 it is difficult to believe that all the five hundred rehearsed the long narratives prefixed to some of Buddha\u2019s discourses in the same words and style that they are now clothed in. Buddhaghosa\u2019s account of the synod is gathered from tradition, which was very probably embodied in the Sinhalese at\u1e6dhakath\u00e1s, and there can be little doubt that the main facts are correct; but that he drew largely from tradition, written and oral, and possibly in some instances from imagination, will I think appear clear to any careful reader of the commentaries. Witness for instance his relation of \u0100nanda\u2019s mysterious entrance into the assembly: *pa\u1e6dhaviyam nimujjitu attano \u0101sane yeva att\u0101nam dassesi, \u0101k\u0101sena ganv\u0101 nisiditi pi eke*, \u201cHe plunged into the earth and showed himself in his seat, and also some say he went through the air and sat down.\u201d He does not say which version is correct, but is quite satisfied with both accounts, and is evidently quite willing to let his readers choose whichever they like. Buddhaghosa throughout all his writings appears to have set one great object prominently in view, namely to inspire reverence for what he considered as supreme authority. When he came to Ceylon for the purpose of translating the Sinhalese commentaries, he found a great many extant at that time,\u00b2 and out of these commentaries, embracing no doubt various shades of opinion, and representing different schools of thought, he had to expunge, abridge, enlarge, and make a new commentary.\u00b3 Now how could he do all this, and at the same time preserve undiminished among future generations the same reverence and authority in which the older commentaries were held\n\n\u00b9 *Pucchavissajjanapariyos\u0101ne pa\u00f1ca arahantasat\u0101ni sa\u1e45gah\u0101\u1e43 \u0101ropitanayen\u2019 eva g\u0101nas\u016bjhay\u0101m ak\u0101misu.*\n\u00b2 These are distinctly enumerated by him\u2014\nMah\u0101-atthakath\u0101 c\u2019eva Mah\u0101paccarim eva ca\nKurundi cati tisso pi Sih\u0101lat\u1e6dhakath\u0101 im\u0101.\u2014Samanta P\u0101s\u0101dik\u0101.\n\u00b3 See note C.\nby the Buddhists of that age? The thought struck him, as no doubt it would strike any careful reader of the Buddhist Scriptures, that a large portion of the writings contained in that canon appear to be explanations and definitions of terms used by Buddha, and also that a great many discourses said to have been delivered by Buddha to certain individuals have not been recorded.\u00b9 Now what more easy to conceive, or what more probable, than that they formed the nucleus of matter for the formation of a commentary, and that at the First General Council, which lasted seven months, the elders, who had all seen and heard Buddha, should have discussed them, and decided on the method of interpreting and teaching the more recondite portions of Buddhist philosophy? and what therefore if he should say in somewhat exaggerated language, \u201cthe commentary on the Digha Nik\u00e1ya was at the beginning discussed (or composed, or merged into the body of the Scriptures) by five hundred holy elders\u201d?\u2014for the original words may admit of such a construction.\u00b2 Nor will this opinion appear merely hypothetical if we carefully peruse the account given by Buddhaghosa of the commentaries in his Samanta P\u00e1s\u00e1dik\u00e1. In his metrical introduction to that work, after the usual doxology, he explains the necessity of having a proper P\u00e1li Commentary on the Vinaya, and then proceeds to set forth what he is about to do:\n\nSamva\u1e47\u1e47anam ta\u00f1 ca sam\u00e1rabhanto tass\u00e1 mah\u00e1-at\u1e6dhakath\u0101\u1e41 sariram\nKatv\u00e1, mah\u00e1pacariyam tath\u2019 eva kurundin\u00e1m\u00e1disu vissut\u00e1su\nVinicchayo at\u1e6dhakath\u00e1su vutto yo yuttam attham apariccajanto,\nTato pi antogadhatherav\u00e1dam, samva\u1e47\u1e47anam samm\u00e1 sam\u00e1-rabhissam;\nTam me nis\u00e1mentu pasannacitt\u00e1 ther\u00e1 ca bhikkh\u00fa navamajjhim\u00e1ca\nDhammapadipassa tath\u00e1gatassa sakka dhamma\u1e41 patim\u00e1nya-yant\u00e1.\nBuddhena dhammo vinayo ca vutto, yo tassa puttehi tath\u2019 eva \u00f1\u00e1to,\nYo yehi tesam matim accajant\u00e1 yasm\u00e1 pure at\u1e6dhakath\u00e1 akam\u1e63u\n\n\u00b9 See note D.\n\u00b2 At\u1e6dhakath\u00e1 \u00e1dito vasisatehi pa\u00f1cahi sa\u1e45g\u00edta.\nTasm\u00e1 hi ya\u1e47a at\u1e6dhakath\u00e1su vuttam ta\u1e47a, vajjayitr\u00e1na pam\u00e1-\ndalekha\u1e47i,\nSabbam pi sikkh\u00e1su sag\u00e1rav\u00e1nan yasm\u00e1 pam\u00e1\u1e47an idha pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u00e1-\nna\u1e47.\nTato ca bh\u00e1santaram era hitv\u00e1, vitth\u00e1ramagga\u00f1 ca sam\u00e1sayitv\u00e1,\nVinicchayam sabbam asesayitv\u00e1, tantikkaman ka\u1e47ci avokkamitr\u00f3,\nSuttantik\u00e1nan vacan\u00e1nam attham sutt\u00e1nur\u00fapan paridipayanti\nYasm\u00e1 aya\u1e47 hessati van\u1e47an\u00e1 pi sakkaca tasm\u00e1 anusikkhitabb\u00e1.\n\nThe translation is rather difficult, owing to the complexity\nand conciseness of the construction, but it may be rendered\nthus:\u2014\"In commencing this commentary, I shall, having\nembodied therein the Mah\u00e1 At\u1e6dhakath\u00e1, without excluding\nany proper meaning from the decisions contained in the Mah\u00e1\nPaccari, as also in the famous Kurundi and other com-\nmentaries, and including the opinions of the Elders,\u2014perform\nmy task well. Let the young, the middle-aged, and the\nelderly priests, who entertain a proper regard for the doctrines\nof the Tath\u00e1gata, the luminary of truth, listen to my words\nwith pleasure. The Dhamma, as well as the Vinaya, was\ndeclared by Buddha, his (sacerdotal) sons understood it in the\nsame sense as it was delivered; and inasmuch as in former\ntimes they (the Simhalese commentators) composed the com-\nmentaries without disregarding their (the sacerdotal sons\u2019)\nopinions, therefore, barring any error of transcription, every-\nthing contained therein is an authority to the learned in this\npriesthood who respect ecclesiastical discipline. From these\n(Simhalese) commentaries, after casting off the language,\ncondensing detailed accounts, including authoritative deci-\nsions, and without overstepping any P\u00e1li idiom (I shall pro-\nceed to compose). And as this commentary will moreover\nbe explanatory of the meaning of words belonging to the\nSuttas in conformity with the sense attached to them therein,\ntherefore ought it the more diligently to be studied.\"\n\nNow, in this important passage, Buddhaghosa make men-\ntion of three distinct commentaries, and refers to others then\nin existence, besides naming another authority called Thera\nV\u00e1da (the opinions of the Elders). The three commentaries\nenumerated are\u20141, Mah\u00e1 At\u1e6dhakath\u00e1; 2, Mah\u00e1 Paccari;\n3, Kurundi. Were these three commentaries separate works on the Vinaya, the Sutta, and the Abhidhamma respectively, or did they each embrace the whole of the Tipitaka? It is difficult to answer this question with positive certainty, but there are good reasons to incline to the latter opinion. The glossarists (authors of the T\u012bk\u0101s) give but a very imperfect account of these works. However, it will be well to hear what they say of them:\u2014Mah\u00e1 atthakath\u00e1 n\u00e1ma pathama-mah\u00e1sa\u1e45giti-\u00e1ru\u1e37h\u00e1 mah\u00e1kassapapamukhehi therehi kat\u00e1 mah\u00e1-mah\u00edndena \u00e1netv\u00e1 Sih\u00e1labh\u00e1s\u00e1ya kat\u00e1 mah\u00e1-atthakath\u00e1 n\u00e1ma j\u00e1t\u00e1, \u201cMah\u00e1 Atthakath\u00e1 is evidently what was gathered in the first great Council. It was made by the elders, with Kassapa as their chief. Having been brought by Mah\u00e1 Mahinda, and converted into the Sinhalese language, it was called Mah\u00e1 Atthakath\u00e1.\u201d It is clear, therefore, that this is the same commentary (atthakath\u00e1) referred to by Buddhaghosa in his Suma\u1e45gala Vil\u00e1sin\u00ed. Mah\u00e1paccari n\u00e1ma Sih\u00e1labh\u00e1s\u00e1ya ulumpa\u00f1 kira atthi tasmin nisiditr\u00e1 katatt\u00e1 mah\u00e1paccari n\u00e1ma j\u00e1t\u00e1, \u201cIt is said that there was a raft called in the Sinhalese language Mah\u00e1 Paccari; as this work was composed on that raft, it was called Mah\u00e1 Paccari.\u201d Kurundattakath\u00e1 n\u00e1ma Kurundaveluh\u00e1ro n\u00e1ma atthi tasmin nisiditr\u00e1 katatt\u00e1 kurundi n\u00e1ma j\u00e1t\u00e1, \u201cThere is a vih\u00e1ra called Kurundavelu; as the work was composed there, it was called Kurundi.\u201d In their remarks on the word \u00e1di in this verse, the authors of the S\u00e1rattha D\u00edpan\u00ed and the Vimati Vinodani T\u012bk\u0101s enumerate two works called Andhaka\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u00e1 and Sa\u1e45khepat\u1e6dhakath\u00e1, but the Vajira Buddhi T\u012bk\u00e1 gives Cullapaccari and Andhaka\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u00e1.\n\nThus it will be seen that the information furnished to us by the glossarists respecting these lost works is very meagre, and leads one to suspect that at their time almost all traces of them had disappeared, although in the P\u00e1li Muttaka (a work written by one of these glossarists) reference is made to all the three commentaries. Mention is also made of the Mah\u00e1 Atthakath\u00e1 and another commentary called Mula\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u00e1 at the end of the D\u00edgha and Majjhima\n\n---\n\n1 See Preface to Minayeff's P\u00e1timokkha, pages vii and viii, notes 9, 10, 11, 12.\u2014R.C.C.\nNik\u00e1yas. In the Sammoha Vinodan\u00ed (commentary on the Vibha\u1e45ga), Buddhaghosa states that he composed that work \"by taking the substance of the old commentaries.\" It appears pretty clear therefore that all the Sinhalese commentaries enumerated by Buddhaghosa were each separate works on the entire body of the Tipi\u1e6daka. Those comments were probably more or less directed to the elucidation of one or more of the Pi\u1e6dakas, but that each of them purported to be a separate and independent commentary on the entire Tipi\u1e6daka I think there can be little room to doubt.\n\nIn his introduction to the Samanta P\u00e1s\u00e1d\u00edk\u00e1, Buddhaghosa uses the following words: \"The Dhamma as well as the Vinaya was declared by Buddha, his sacerdotal sons understood it in the same sense as it was delivered; and, inasmuch as in former times they (i.e. the Sinhalese commentators) made the commentaries without rejecting their (i.e. Buddha's immediate disciples') opinions, therefore, etc.\" This passage will, I think, explain the sense in which he uses the word Atthakath\u00e1 in his preface to the Sumangala Vil\u00e1sin\u00ed. For two things are clearly deducible from the passage, viz., that when Buddhaghosa speaks of the Atthakath\u00e1 that existed in the earliest days of Buddhism, and almost contemporaneously with Buddha, he only refers to the method of explaining and interpreting the Buddhist Scriptures adopted by Buddha's immediate disciples, and also that Mahinda was not the sole composer of the commentaries, but that there were others who, either jointly with Mahinda or separately, composed comments on the Sacred Canon. One of the glossarists in expounding this passage takes a very sensible view of the matter. His words are:\u2014Buddhena dhammo vinayo ca vutto ti p\u00e1lito ca atthato ca buddhena bhagavat\u00e1 vutto, na hi bhagavat\u00e1 avy\u00e1katam tantipadam atthi, sabbesam yeva attho kathito, tasma samm\u00e1sambuddhen' eva ti\u1e47\u1e47am pitak\u00e1nam athava\u1e47\u1e47an\u0101k- kamo pi bh\u00e1sito ti dat\u1e6dhabbam, tattha tattha bhagavat\u00e1 pavattit\u00e1 pakinnakadesan\u00e1 yeva hi atthakath\u00e1, \"The Dhamma as well as the Vinaya was declared by Buddha; that is, it was declared\n\n1 M\u016blat\u1e6dhakath\u00e1saram addya, etc. 2 Por\u0101nat\u1e6dhakath\u0101nam s\u0101ram addya.\n3 See note E.\nby the blessed Buddha in words as in sense, for there is not one scriptural term which has not been defined by the Blessed One: the sense of all words has been truly expounded. Therefore it should be borne in mind that it is by the all-perfect Buddha himself that even the method of interpreting the three Pitakas has been propounded. In fact, the desultory discourses made by the Blessed One here and there, are what is meant by the word Atthakath\u00e1.\u201d My view of this subject therefore receives additional weight from the exposition given of Buddhaghosa\u2019s meaning by his glossarist.\n\nNor will this view receive less support from collateral facts connected with the life and ministry of the \u201cGreat Sage,\u201d who gave to the world a creed that has stood the test of time and the progress of the human intellect during upwards of twenty-four centuries. He renounced the world and all its pleasures in the vigour of life, being then in his twenty-ninth year, passed his days for six long years in a wilderness, subjecting his delicate frame to a severe course of mortification and penance, and at length, receiving the light of that philosophy by which he thought himself capable of explaining all the mysteries of nature, he entered upon a career of religious reformation which lasted for forty-five years. During this long period of uninterrupted labour, he not only preached and argued and conversed and travelled, but also legislated, and gave to his disciples a code of monastic discipline surpassed by no other system of monachism either in the East or West. Can it be imagined then that the Tipitaka contains all the words of Buddha? Undoubtedly not. To the followers of that faith it may contain \u201call that is necessary to salvation,\u201d but it assuredly does not record all and everything done and spoken by this almost superhuman intellect. If John could say of the pious Nazarene of Jud\u00e6a that if all the things he had done should be written every one, the world itself could not contain the books, what length of hyperbole must be used in reference to the doings and sayings of the great philosopher and teacher of India, whose term of unremitted labour so greatly exceeded that of Jesus of Nazareth?\nIt is a hopeless task, as Mr. Childers says, to inquire into what has become of the old Simhalese commentaries. No trace of them now exists. The early diffusion of the P\u00e1li language among the priesthood and learned laity, and the subsequent introduction of Sanskrit literature and Sanskrit verbiage into the once pure Elu,\\(^1\\) must have so choked that language that it died out early, and its memory was cherished only by the lovers of Parnassus. For all philosophic and religious purposes the P\u00e1li and the Sanskritized Simhalese began to be used from a very early period, and continue to be used to the present day.\n\nL. Comrilla Vijasinha.\n\nRatnapura, Feb. 21, 1871.\n\nNOTES.\n\n(By the Author.)\n\nNote A.\u2014It is my opinion, although contrary to that of orthodox Buddhists, that the Buddhistic philosophy, in so far as regards its asceticism and self-purification, is derived from the Hindu system of Patanjali. I think a perusal of the Patanjali Yoga and its Commentary by Bhoja R\u00e1ja will instinctively lead one to this conclusion, taking for granted, as it undoubtedly appears, that the Patanjali Yoga S\u00fatra was anterior to the Buddhistic era. It is quite clear that Buddha\u2019s first ascetic teachers, \u00c1l\u00e1ra K\u00e1l\u00e1ma and Uddakar\u00e1ma Putta, were followers of this system.\n\nNote B.\u2014It is evident from Buddhaghosa\u2019s narrative of the convocations that the Council of the Five Hundred (pa\u00f1casatikasangiti) assembled within two months from the date of Buddha\u2019s death. The proposal by Mah\u00e1 Kassapa to his brethren to go to R\u00e1jagaha for the purpose was made fourteen days after Buddha\u2019s death:\u2014\n*Atha tath\u00e1gathassa parinibb\u00e1nato sattasu s\u00e1dhuk\u00edlanadivasesu sattasu dh\u00e1tup\u00faj\u00e1divasesu vitivattesu addham\u00e1so atikkanto.* After coming to R\u00e1jagaha the Theras were occupied during the first month in causing repairs to be made to the monasteries already abandoned by the priests, and afterwards informed the king Aj\u00e1tasattu that their work was over, and requested him to furnish a hall of assembly (sannisajjatth\u00e1nam):\u2014*Ther\u00e1 pa\u1e6dhamam\u00e1sam sabbavih\u00e1ra-pa\u1e6disankharanam k\u00far\u00e1petv\u00e1 ra\u00f1\u00f1o \u00e1rocesu\u1e43.* The king accordingly\n\n\\(^1\\) The old Simhalese Pr\u00e1krit, still used in writing poetry.

No great ability was required for this purpose, much less extraordinary talents. In his introduction to the Vinaya Atthakath\u00e1, he tells us briefly what he undertook to perform, \"to translate, abridge, collate, systematize, etc.,\" in fact, to make a P\u00e1li variorum edition of the Sinhalese commentaries. No wonder that the learned Sinhalese priests of that period thought it prudent to test beforehand his latent talents by giving him a text from the sacred canon as a subject for a thesis. The result of this test was, as we know, the Visuddhi Magga, embodying the entire system of Buddhism.\n\nNote D.\u2014Ekamantam nisinnassa kho Yasassa kulaputtassa Bhagav\u00e1 anupubbikatham kathesi, seyyathidam d\u00e1nakatham silakatham sagakatham, k\u00e1m\u00e1nam \u00e1dinavam ok\u00e1ram sa\u1e45kilesam nekkhamme \u00fanisamsan pak\u00e1sesi: yadda Bhagav\u00e1 a\u00f1\u00f1\u00e1si Yasam kulaputta\u00f1 kallacittam muducittam vinivara\u1e47acittam udaggacittam pasannacittam atha y\u00e1 buddhanam simukkams\u00edka dhammadesana tam pak\u00e1sesi, dukkham samudayam nirodham maggam, \"Then the Blessed One related to the genteel Yasa, who sat by his side, an orderly series of narratives, viz.: regarding charity, restraint, and heavenly pleasures; he discoursed on the evil, the vanity, the pollution of sensual pleasures, and the blessing of self-abnegation.

During this long interval a goodly number of works on the tenets of Buddhism must have been composed. Perhaps the frequent allusions to the Mah\u00e1 Atthakath\u00e1 and M\u00falatthakath\u00e1, the \"great commentary\" and the \"original commentary,\" refer to Mahinda's original work, and the Paccar\u00ed, Kurundi, etc., refer to subsequent compilations.\nART. XV.\u2014The Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan, of Arragon.\n\nBy the Right Hon. Lord Stanley of Alderley.\n\n(Continued from p. 140.)\n\nThe portion of Rabadan's poem given in the present part of the Journal relates the history of Shaibeh or Abdulmutalib, the son of Heshim, and of his son Abdullah, the father of the Prophet. It contains a narrative of the offering up of Abdullah in sacrifice by his father, with regard to which see the following observations of Sir Wm. Muir, vol. i., p. cclix. That writer believes the story, because, as he says, \"the simple desire to establish an analogy (between it and Abraham's intended sacrifice), had there been no facts to found the story on, would have led to a very different fiction; for Abraham was commanded to offer up his son, and the Mussulmans believe he acted piously in obeying; whereas they hold Abdulmutalib, who was borne out by no such divine order, to have been wrong both in the vow and in his attempt to fulfil it.\" These observations are supported by this poem, for Rabadan does not appear to draw any analogy between the sacrifice by Abraham and that by Abdulmutalib, whereas by using similar expressions he seems very clearly to intend to point out the analogy between the Deluge and the end of the world. The opinion which Sir W. Muir describes as the prevailing one with respect to Abdulmutalib's act is here spoken by the sage Ykrama. It was with reference to the incident related in this poem that Muhammad spoke of himself as \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0628\u064a\u062d\u064a\u0646, or as the son of the two offered up in sacrifice; this is not considered by some as necessarily implying that Ishmael and not Isaac was the son offered up by Abraham, since Isaac might, according\nto Arab custom, be spoken of as an ancestor equally with Ishmael. Though it is not expressly stated that Ishmael and not Isaac was offered up in sacrifice, the majority of Mussulman writers believe that it was Ishmael, and consider this view as borne out by the words of Genesis xxii. 2, \"Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac.\"\n\nThe latter portion of this part of the poem describes the marriage of Abdullah with Eminah, and his death.\n\nI hope that in the next part of the Journal the publication of Rabadan's poem may be concluded: it will contain the life of Muhammad, and two short poems, one of which is wanting in the Paris MS.\nISTORIA DE

flecha en la mano,\nY contra los cuatrocientos\nQue vinieron en su ayuda\nApunt\u00f3 el agudo yerro.\nDixo Zalma en altas voces,\nQue bien los dos lo entendieron:\n\u00bf\u201cQui\u00e9n ha sido el

tierno\nQue lo llev\u00f3 nueve meses\nY le dio el primer sustento;\nOtra vez mira \u00e1 su t\u00edo\nY aqu\u00e9l tan debido deudo\nQue le obligaba \u00e1 seguir\nEl mandamiento paterno:\nAl fin respondi\u00f3 \u00e1 su madre\nCon un singular respeto:\n\u201cA tanto merecimiento,\nQuerr\u00eda seguir mi t\u00edo,\nSi \u00e1 ti no desobedezco;\nTemo ad All\u00e1h si te enojo,\nY por tanto me resuelvo\nQue ir\u00e9 donde t\u00fa quisieres,\nSupuesto lo que he propuesto.\u201d\nComo conoci\u00f3 Zalma\n\u00c1 do el principal deseo\nDe su hijo caminaba,\nNo quiso mas detenerlo;\nAntes bien con grandes muestras\nDe amor y contentamiento,\nLo bendice, abraza y besa\nY luego se despidieron\nDella con gran reverencia,\nY grandes ofrecimientos,\nDe la una y otra parte,\nY su camino emprendieron.\nElla se fue \u00e1 Yaziriba\nY ellos \u00e1 Maca se fueron,\nY andando por el camino\nAlmut\u00e1lib, muy contento,\nDixo \u00e1 su caro sobrino:\n\"Escucha lo que te advierto,\nSi te

nunca\u00b9 persiguen\nSi no un traidor y otro reo;\nEste los tubo continuos,\nPues desde su nacimiento\nLe fueron buscando modos\nPara acabarlo y perderlo.\nEra en este tiempo en Maca\nUn hombre

ser tenida\nLa dedicaci\u00f3n y oferta,\nQuanto en provecho resulta,\nSi en el efecto se acierta;\nQue cuanto en provecho sube\nAnte la bondad inmensa,\nTanto desmerece y pierde\nSi dedicada la dexan.\nLa promesa es voluntaria,\nPero despu\u00e9s que est\u00e1 hecha,\nPoniendo al Se\u00f1or por medio,\nEs como que la preceptan;\nY derogarse de aquello,\nSupuesto quel tal no peca,\nPierde el cr\u00e9dito de siervo,\nSu palabra y nombre afean;\nY as\u00ed es bien lo considere\nQuien dedica una promesa,\nQue lo que hace y por quien,\nAntes que lo tal emprenda.\nNo se arroje de improviso,\nHaga despacio su cuenta,\nY ajuste lo que promete\nCon lo que sustentar pueda;\nY hecha su resoluci\u00f3n,\nAf\u00edrmela de manera\nComo que \u00e1 cumplir le obliga\nSu m\u00e1s estimada prenda,\nPor que en las cosas decididas\n\nHase de hablar siempre veras,\nNo burlas, que no se sufren\nAun en las cosas terrenas.\nVirtud es muy conocida\nEl que en su salud entera\nPor ver las cosas divinas\nAl mundo los ojos cierra,\nCuando su libertad priva\nY su voluntad refrena,\nCuando su gusto reprime\nY su apetito sujet\u00e1.\nEsto es lo que mas afirman\nNuestros \u00e1limes y aprueban,\nQuanto \u00e1 los divinos ojos\nMas aplac\u00e9 y mas contenta;\nPero entre las buenas obras\nLa que escogen por mas buena\nEs la ofrecida, que a Dios\nY \u00e1 sus \u00e1ngeles alegra;\nEl voto es superlativo\nQue nada con \u00e9l se allega:\nCuando la lengua lo dice\nY el coraz\u00f3n lo cimienta,\nCuando para confirmalle\nSe junta la vehemencia,\nY hacen un mismo consorcio\nLos sentidos y potencias;\nEntonces se graba en el pecho,\nEntonces se desapega\n\n1 Naciones.\n2 Ordenaste.\n3 Es decir siervo de Dios, que le acata y obedece.\n4 Sabios y doctores.\nDel mundo, y graciosamente\nPone sobre si esta deuda.\nBien es verdad que seria\nMejor, que nuestra vivienda\nFuese tal que no tuviese\nNecesidad de estas pruebas;\nMas como tan quebradiza\nFu\u00e9 nuestra naturalcza,\nRompe \u00e1 veces, y es bien\nQue se soldc con la enmienda.\nEvitemos la ocasion\nDel vicio, por que con ella\nNo se graba la oblacion,\nQue casi viene por fuerza.\nYa que ocasion tengamos,\nNo scamos causa de ella,\nPor que la causa que es justa,\nEs justo se salga \u00e1 ella.\nOcasion tuvo quien duda\nQue no fu\u00e9 grande la afrenta\nQue recibi\u00f3 Abdulmut\u00e1lib,\nQue en la pasada contienda\nGrande fue sin duda alguna\nQuando por salir de aquella,\nOfreci\u00f3 al Se\u00f1or de un hijo\nLa vida que tanto cuesta.\nEra en aquel tiempo en Maca\nY en todas las demas tierras\nTenido el hombre sin hijos\nPor hombre de baxas prendas;\nY es cierto que si otra cosa\nSu contrario conociera\nQue mas afrenta le hacian,\nOtra peor le dixera;\nPor qu\u00e9 en tales ocasiones\nSuele la colera ciega\nProvocar palabras tales\nQue, \u00e1 quien las dice, afrenta;\nY \u00e1 un hombre de tanta estima,\nComo Abdulmut\u00e1lib era,\nFu\u00e9 desconcierto muy grande\nTratallo de tal manera,\nPor tomar lo que era suyo,\nSu patrimonio y herencia,\nY aquello que le venia\nPor tan derecha linea.\nY asi no podr\u00e1 decirse\nQuel fu\u00e9 la ocasion primera,\nPor do despues le obligase\nA satisfacion tan fiera;\nPero fu\u00e9 mucho arrojarse,\nDerog\u00f3 su gran prudencia;\nQue fu\u00e9 temeraria cosa\nEl ofrecer vida agena,\nCosa incierta de cumplir;\nY en caso que la cumpliera,\nA todos sus descendientes\nDaba ejemplo de crueza.\nEjemplo que tanto obliga\nA dar ejemplarias muestras\nA los que para dechado\nLos puso Dios en la tierra;\nAquellas que tras de si\nLos ojos del vulgo llevan,\nEn cuyos hechos miraban\nY \u00e1 cuyas obras se aplcan.\n\nYa sus diez hijos tenia\nDe edad cumplida y entera,\nPadres con hijos, algunos\nCasados y con haciendas,\nQuando de verlos \u00e1 todos\nMas se contenta y se huelga;\nY quando mayor regalo\nLe causaban sus presencias,\nY quando mas descuidado\nDe su pasada promesa\nEst\u00e1, que el tiempo vario\nMueve su inconstante rueda,\nRecord\u00f3le la memoria\n(Que All\u00e1h es al fin quien\nremiembra\nLos hechos de sus amigos\nPor que su gloria no pierdan)\nAquell alto ofrecimiento\nQue \u00e9l hizo a la suma alteza\nDe sacrificar un hijo,\nSi \u00e1 los diez sus hijos llegan;\nY al punto que fu\u00e9 acordado\nCon aflijida conductma,\nSin dar una ora de espacio,\nQue la dilacion no es buena,\nAntes con las cosas tales\nMejor quanto mas se abrevian,\nLlam\u00f3 \u00e1 sus hijos queridos\nY puestos en su presencia,\nA todos diez les declara\nLo que el se\u00f1or ofreciera.\nEllos quedaron suspensos,\nQue nadie mueve la lengua,\nAbaxadas las ciervices,\nLos ojos puestos en tierra:\nMirabanse unos \u00e1 otros,\nAlteranse y titubean,\nQue la muerte enmedio de ellos\nLes quaj\u00f3 la sangre nueva.\nNinguno nada responde,\nPor que cada qual rezela\nLa suerte del sacrificio,\nQue no es mucho que la tengan;\nY al fin, rompiendo el silencio,\nCon cara alegre y serena,\nAbdullah, el menor de todos,\nDi\u00f3 la siguiente respuesta:\n\"Cierto, car\u00edsimo padre,\nQue has ofrecido una empresa\nQue jam\u00e1s en tiempo alguno\nHa sido por nadie hecha;\nPero pues que ya la hiciste,\nNo hay para que mas se atienda,\nMas de cumplir lo ofrecido\n\u00c1 su divina obediencia;\nY jam\u00e1s All\u00e1h permita\nQue entre nos haya otras se\u00f1as,\nQue aspiren mas de \u00e1 servirte\nEn cuanto mandes y quieras,\nTodos diez somos tus hijos,\nTodos damos la obediencia\nAl se\u00f1or que nos cri\u00f3,\nY al padre que nos engendr\u00f3;\nTodos somos muy contentos,\nTodos sus vidas entregan,\nY yo por todos ofrezco\nMi garganta la primera.\nVolvi\u00f3se el padre \u00e1 los otros,\nPor ver si lo dicho aprueban,\nY todos le respondieron\nDe aquella propia manera\nDiciendo; \"no solo el uno,\nMas si te place que mueran\nTodos, todos moriremos\nCon voluntad muy sincera.\"\nQued\u00f3 tan agradecido\nDe la humildad y nobleza,\nCon que todos se ofrec\u00edan,\n\nSin dar muestra de flaqueza,\nQue mil veces les bendice,\nDeshecho en lagrimas tiernas;\nY dixoles: \"hijos m\u00edos,\nPues

nadie le haga fuerza?\n\u00a1 Hay crueldad que se iguale,\nQuando de ti el mundo entienda\nQue degollaste tu hijo,\nPor un enojo siquiera!\nY si acaso no se escusa\nDe hacer esto que intentas,\nToma de los nueve el uno,\nY este mas peque\u00f1o dexa:\nDuclete de su ni\u00f1ez\nSu hermosura considera;\nMira la luz de su frente\nQue hasta los cielos clare\u00e1;\nMira que en solo su muerte\nEsta triste vida cuelga\nY es cierto que no tendre\nMas vida que la que el tenga.\u201d\nRespondi\u00f3 Abdulmut\u00e1lib:\n\u201cNo dudes que \u00e1 mi me pesa\nQuitalle solo un cabello\nDe encima de su cabeza,\nQuanto mas dalle la muerte,\nSiendo de mi luz candela;\nMas la ofrenda del Se\u00f1or\nNo es razon que yo la tuerza,\nPor su beldad y tu duelo,\nNi quanto el mundo sustenta;\nYo le soy mas

adreza;\nDespidese de su madre\nY ella lo bendice y besa\nDiciendo tales palabras,\nQue hieieran llorar las piedras.\n\u00a1 O hijo! \u00e1 quien el Se\u00f1or\nOrden\u00f3 que en mi presencia,\nTu

hijo\nDegollado \u00e1 su presencia.\nAbdulmut\u00e1lib lloraba\nConvertido en tierna cera,\nQue lagrimas tan ardientes\nNo es mucho que le enternezcan.\nAl fin mand\u00f3 \u00e1 su hijo\nSin buscar mas detenci\u00f3n,\nNi dar audiencia \u00e1 mas lloros,\nSe sali\u00f3 la puerta afuera,\nLa triste F\u00e1tima sigue\nTras de ellos como la oveja,\nQue el tierno hijo le quitan\nY con \u00e9l le hacen se\u00f1as.\nAs\u00ed llorando camina,\nTurbada y en agua envuelta,\nQue sus haldas la acongojan\nEn ellas mismas tropieza;\nDerramase en la comarca\nEn Maca y toda su tierra\nLa nueva, y ansi vinieron\nQuantos oyeron las nuevas.\nLleg\u00f3se tanto gent\u00edo\nA ver esta gran tragedia,\nQue en la Ciudad no cog\u00edan\nSu gente y la forastera.\nVinieron los adivinos\nDe aquella gente perversa,\nQue siempre \u00e1 los de la luz\nFueron armando cautelas;\nPor que siempre estos traidores\nTenian cierta sospecha,\nQue el Patron de aquesta luz\nAcabaria sus sectas,\nY mas que en sus relicarios\nEstos malditos profetas,\nTenian una camisa\nQue fue con la sangre envuelta\nDel justo Yahiye,\\(^1\\) y dec\u00edan\nSus escrituras y letras,\nQue al tiempo que aquella aljuba\nGotease sangre espesa,\nSe acercaba la venida\n\nDe la espada de su guerra.\nY como naci\u00f3 Abdullahi,\nVieron patentes las se\u00f1as,\nQue \u00e1 toda prisa la sangre\nDe la t\u00fanica gotea,\nY por aqu\u00ed conocieron\nQue su perdici\u00f3n se allega.\nY \u00e1 esta causa juntaron\nEn las ciudades y aldeas\nLos barraganes mas fuertes,\nD\u00e1ndoles orden expresa\nQue matasen \u00e1 Abdullahi\nPor donde quiera que puedan.\nAs\u00ed llegaron \u00e1 Maca,\nCon la codicia sedienta\nDe haberlo puesto en la lista\nDe la ofrecida deguella;\nY por si acaso la suerte\nDaba \u00e1 su gusto la vuelta,\nSe ofrecieron grandes dones,\nGrandes joyas y preseas.\nLleg\u00f3, pues, Abdulmut\u00e1lib\nA la casa reverenda,\nY sus diez hijos delante,\nY las suertes luego ordenan,\nSegun entonces se usaban,\nY al sortero las entregan.\nDi\u00f3le tambien sus diez hijos,\nY luego en el alcaba entran\nDos mancebos, y el sortero,\nQuedando el padre defuera\nCon el alfange en la mano\nQue al delgado filo tiembla;\nQue alterado al fin era\nDe esta compostura humana,\nFundada en tantas flaquezas.\nY antes que las suertes echase\n\u00c1 las aceiras se allega,\nY asido dellas rogaba\nAd Allah, que en su deguella\nReciba con la afici\u00f3n\nQue lo hace y lo desea.\nRog\u00f3 tambien que Abdullahi\nLibre de la muerte sea,\nY que la suerte cayese\nSobre los otros que quedan;\nPor que este solo cuidado\nEra el que mas le apreta,\nPor que mas \u00e1 este amaba\n\n\\(^1\\) San Juan Bautista.\nQue si tuviera cincuenta,\nAcabada su oracion,\nLuego las acitras dexa,\nDiciendo al sortero que eche\nLas suertes y no se detenga.\nEstaba este justo entonces\nPuesto en publica almoneda,\nTanto mirado de todos\nY con tanta deferencia.\nEstaba todo el gentio\nEn torno de la ancha puerta,\nAguardando que saliese\nEl que la suerte condena;\nAll\u00ed estaban sus amigos,\n(Sus parientes all\u00ed eran)\nSus emulos y contrarios,\nQue lo persiguen y aquexan:\nLos unos se compadecen\nDe su trabajo y condelma,\nQue el bueuo tiene de ser\nComo el suyo, es bien lo sienta:\nOtros quisieran mas verle\nEn miserias mas estrechas,\nQuel malo mas mal concibe\nQue el que por defuera muestra.\nLos unos al padre llaman,\nLos otros mal le desean;\nLos unos al hijo aman,\nLos otros ya le condenan.\nDe esta manera la turba\nDe la gente estaba puesta,\nCondicion del vulgo vario\nQue nunca lo bueno aprueba.\nLas tristes madres presentes,\nQue cada qual teme y piensa\nDar \u00e1 su hijo tal suerte,\nY esto la turba inquieta;\nSus blandas manos torcian,\nGimen de cuidado y tiemblan\nPor aquel trago que aguardan\nEntre congoxa y tristeza.\nAsi de esta suerte estaban,\nMirando la santa puerta,\nTantos ojos sin moverse\nLas pesta\u00f1as y las cejas;\nUnos por cima de otros\nSe levantan y enderezan,\nSobre las puntas se empinan,\nSe alargan y el cuello infiestan;\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Alargan, levantan.\n\nQuando la puerta se abre,\nY vieron salir por ella\nAl sortero y tras de s\u00ed\nAl buen Abdullahi lleva:\nUna toca al blanco cuello\nDada por \u00e9l una vuelta,\nSin luz su cara amarilla,\nTemblando sus carnes bellas;\nY tras d\u00e9l sus nueve hermanos\nLlorando, y por \u00e9l vocean\nEl sentimiento excesivo,\nComo si en ello se vieran.\nQuando lo vio Abdulmut\u00e1lib,\nVino \u00e1 dar consigo en tierra,\nSi no quel animo fuerte\nDe su prosapia lo esfuerza.\nAlz\u00f3 la gente un ruido,\nGimen, suspiran, lamentan,\nViendo el mas gallardo mozo,\nQue cri\u00f3 naturaleza,\nEl cuchillo \u00e1 la garganta,\nEn la edad mas tierna y bella.\n\u00a1Que diremos de su madre,\nQuando su cierta sospecha\nVi\u00f3 patente y \u00e1 la clara\nAveriguada y derecha!\nConsiderenlo las madres\nQue una llaga muy peque\u00f1a\nDe sus hijos las

arrebata,\nRodando los cuerpos muertos\nSin las infernales almas.\nMientras duraron las flechas\nFuriosas y apresuradas,\nY luego en siendo acabadas,\nEn falta de las saetas\nPe\u00f1ascos terribles

XVI.\u2014Proverbia Communia Syriaca. By Captain R. F. Burton.\n\n\"The genius, spirit, and wit of a nation are discovered in its proverbs.\"\u2014Bacon.\n\nA writer remarks, \"If men at the lowest as well as the highest stage of civilization enunciate the same truths, the fact goes to prove that these truths are unimportant.\" I can hardly assent to the conclusion, even were the premiss correct, whereas it is not. Those familiar with proverbial literature have remarked that some aphorisms are common in matter, and a few even in actual manner and form, to almost all nations and languages. The Syrian, for instance, will say, \"The egg of to-day, not the hen of to-morrow;\" and \"A live dog is better than a dead lion.\" On the other hand, the points of difference are far more important. Setting aside the sayings which \"bear the stamp of their birthplaces, and which wear the colouring and the imagery of their native climes,\" we find that there are proverbs peculiar to every race\u2014proper to it, as are its syntax and its idiom; that each people speaks out the truth or the half truth which is in it, and, consequently, that for the most part neither the idea nor the wording bear comparison. Moreover, were it a fact that all enunciate the same truth, it by no means proves the latter to be unimportant, except to the few. The student of the nineteenth century will not, for higher thought, consult proverbs or proverbial philosophy, or other saws and instances; but he will treat not a few of them as chapters of anthropological and ethnological history; showing how truth arose in the silent education of the world; how the experience of every-day life gradually took shape and status; how the appreciation of experience became concrete in the pithy\naphorism, till at last the \"wisdom of many\" gained life by the \"wit of one.\" In it he sees the process of a pencil of light stealing into the child-like savage brain, slowly but surely dispersing the fatal glooms of ignorance and prejudice, of falsehood and barbarism; assuming various degrees of illumination, and at last becoming the perfect day of wisdom and judgment, of truth and civilization. No wonder, as Count Lucann observes, that proverbs have ever been so popular with the human race.\n\nAs regards these Proverbia Communia. The labours of Pocock, Erpenius, Freytag,\u00b9 and others, have introduced to Europe the repertories of classical Ams\u00e1l (\u0623\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0644), in which the Arabs delighted from the days of the Khalifah Ali to those of El Maydani. My object is not so high. Returning to Western Asia, and resuming the studies which had been interrupted by long service in Africa and South America, I at once recommenced them at the commencement\u2014the alloquialisms of a people new to me. Presently I remembered Burckhardt's Amsal el Masr (Arabic and English, 1830), which aimed at illustrating manners and customs from proverbial sayings current at Cairo, and it appeared to me that the same might be done for Syria.\n\nThe modern dialect of Syria retains distinct traces of the old Aramaean, and, as may be expected in a land where men live much at home, every great city\u2014Damascus, for instance\u2014preserves peculiar words and phrases. And without living interpretation it is impossible to master sayings of purely local use and unfamiliar allusion, further mystified by proverbial sententiousness and conciseness. They must, however, be learnt, and even committed to memory, before a stranger can feel himself at home with the people. Here proverbs have not passed from the learned to the vulgar tongues; they are in universal circulation, amongst all degrees, from the ignorant to the man of highest cultivation; and the apposite use of aphorisms is, like wit and eloquence, a manner of power. Some of the sayings are mostly confined to women, and the\n\n\u00b9 His \"Amsal el Arab,\" in four vols. octavo, is an excerpt from the vast collection of El Maydani.\nnursery; not a few of them have some popular tale whose point they resume. Many are quoted only in part, the rest being suppressed for some obvious reason. So we, for instance, might say \"facit per alium.\" As will be seen, the peculiar vagueness inherent in Arabic speech allows them an immense range of application, and permits them to be used in a variety of senses, which require from us a certain amount of study. Nor is the labour of studying them for their own sake in vain. It is highly interesting to observe the modern succedaneum for the old aphoristic philosophy of Syria, which in some form or other has overspread the civilized world.\n\nOf all the races known to me, the Syrians and certain West African tribes are those who delight most in proverbs. The Spanish type, immortalized in Sancho Pan\u00e7a comes next; the Portuguese loses much of the characteristic; and the Brazilian, his descendant, has wholly lost it. When visiting Goruba I was so much struck by the speeches and harangues\u2014mere conglomerates of quotations\u2014that I persuaded Messrs. Tinsley to publish, in 1865, a collection of 2859 proverbs, popular amongst seven Negroid and Negro nations. The volume, which bore the title of \"Wit and Wisdom from West Africa,\" was not so successful as the Adagia of Erasmus, and of course brought out the remark that the \"sparkles of wit were few and faint, and the wisdom of the mildest order.\" This was to be expected. But my object was to make the people describe themselves, to put them, as it were, in the witness-box upon their racial trial. Pace the critics who differed from me, I cannot but think that the idea of the compilation was good. At any rate, it obtained the approval of one whose opinion in such a matter is worth a thousand cavils of men, who, ignorant of the subject, must borrow from the book itself the arms with which they would assail it. I need hardly mention the name of Mr. William Stirling, now Sir William Stirling Maxwell, of Keir.\n\nThis little repertory of proverbs, which I hope soon to supplement with others, was supplied to me by Mr. Hanna Mish, honorary dragoman of H.B.M.'s Consulate, Damascus.\n1. \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0632\u0648\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0635\u0628\u0639\u0647\u0627\n\n\u201cShe who hath her husband with her, shall turn the moon with her finger.\u201d\n\n2. \u062c\u064a\u0628\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0642\u0646\u0639\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a\n\n\u201cBring girls, and sit not to no purpose.\u201d\u2014It is better (for a woman) to bear girls (if she cannot have boys), and not to remain childless.\n\n3. \u0628\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0628\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0633\u0646\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629\n\n\u201cGirl upon girl, and not retaining (barren) for a year.\u201d\u2014Meaning the same as No. 2.\n\n4. \u0633\u062a\u0649 \u0645\u0646 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0648\u062d\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0631\u064a\u0636\u0629\n\n\u201cMy lady without (the) queasiness (of pregnancy) is unwell.\u201d\u2014Said of a woman who affects to be an invalid; to be delicate, to be interesting.\n\n5. \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0643\u0648\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u0645\u0644 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062e\u0641\u0648\u0646\u0627\n\n\u201cLove and pregnancy, and riding upon a camel, cannot be hid.\u201d\u2014Similar to the Persian \u201cMusk and murder cannot be concealed.\u201d\n\n6. \u0643\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0646\u0634\u063a\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0631 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637 \u0648\u062d\u0645\u0631\u0648\n\n\u201cHowever much the brown woman works, it will not pay for her eye-paint and rouge.\u201d\u2014Applied to men and women who spend more than they make.

So they also say *Misl el Faw\u00e1khireh* (plur. of *Fakh\u00fari*, a jar-maker) *wa la duniy\u00e1 wa la \u00e1khirch*. The jar-maker is proverbially a rascal, and his calling is a poor one. The first three words are generally found sufficient; and to make it more offensive to the Jews, Moslems say, *Misl el yah\u00fad*.\n\n\"Be wroth, O aunt! (here means a stepmother) for all thy curses are in vain.\"\u2014Said to any one who curses or uses bad language. *Fishfish* \u0641\u0634\u0646\u0641\u0634 means literally \"vapid wine.\"\n\n\"A thousand curses never tore a shirt.\"\u2014So our adage, \"Hard words break no bones.\"\n\n\"The mouse is not pure, nor is her prayer answered (by heaven).\"\u2014Said to a bad man who curses.\n\n\"Turn the jar mouth downwards: the daughter will turn out like the mother.\"\u2014The first half is merely for the purpose of rhyme. *Li ummih\u00e1* is also said, instead of *Misl ummih\u00e1*.\n\n\"Girl, who raised thee (so high)?

XVII.\u2014Notes on an Ancient Indian Vase, with an Account of the Engraving thereupon. By Charles Horne, F.R.A.S., late of the Bengal Civil Service.\n\nThis curious and, I believe, unique relic of antiquity is in the form of an ordinary Indian lotah, and measures as follows: Total height, $6\\frac{1}{4}$ in.; diameter, $5\\frac{1}{2}$ in.; ditto at neck, 2 in.; with a projecting circular lip of $\\frac{1}{2}$ in. It is apparently wrought in some fine alloy of brass, copper, and spelter (?), the brass prevailing, and has resisted corrosion in a very remarkable manner; for the date which I would, from external evidence, assign it is between 200 and 300 A.D. It has evidently been treated with the greatest care; for we do not find upon it any signs of the constant polishing with sand and ashes which the lotahs of the natives undergo when in constant use, and which in a few years wears them quite thin.\n\nBefore I enter upon any description of the engraving upon it, I may as well mention how and where it was found. In 1857 Major Hay, then in Political employ in the K\u00fbl\u00fb country, which comprises the districts of Lahoul and Spiti, in the Him\u00e2leh, happening to be near Goondlah, heard that some curious ancient vessels had been found near the junction of the Chandra and Bhag\u00fbr rivers not far distant. It would appear that upon the spot had formerly stood a Buddhist monastery, and that owing to a great landslip a vaulted chamber or hollow had been laid bare, in which were found this brass vase, and some dishes of kassa, or mixed metal. There were some, doubtless, of the more precious metals, but these had disappeared before Major Hay could reach the spot. He was, however, fortunate in being able to secure the object now under notice, which he has kindly placed in my hands for description, and that, if possible, it might find a resting-place in some museum.\n\nThe whole of the exterior, with the exception of a part of\nthe neck, is covered with engraving, effected with a graving tool or fine chisel. The upper part is occupied with six spaces of geometrical ornament running around it, consisting of crossings, lines, circles, and the like. This may take one-third of the space, whilst the lower two-thirds are filled with a spirited representation of a royal progress.\n\nWe have first a young prince in a chariot or ear drawn by four horses abreast, attended by his chowrie-bearer (a female) and his charioteer. The style of the chariot and the drawing of the steeds, perspectively, is most decidedly Greek; whilst the harness of the latter is very peculiar, and I have not been able in any work to meet with similar headstalls or bridles. In the sculptures from Amravat\u00ee there are many harnessed horses, but all their headstalls are square in character; as are those from the Nineveh sculptures. The passing of the reins through a \"terret\" or ring on the withers of the horse exactly resembles the manner of the Romans, as well shown in a plate in Hope's \"Costumes of the Ancients,\" as does the breastband before alluded to. In the Nimroud sculptures the horses' heads when abreast only just project before one another; but here we have nearly half the shoulder visible. There is no slavish conventionalism, and the horses of the mounted men are each in a separate attitude\u2014the one prancing with arched neck, whilst the other is trotting very high. In no case have they any martingale, although almost every horse at Sanchi is shown as having one. The breastbands are set with large studs, probably bosses of metal; whilst the crupper strap is also shown to be ornamented. A large tassel hangs from the shoulder at the junction of the ornamented girth and the breastband. The manes appear to be plaited, and the tails of the chariot horses tied up; whilst those of the steeds of the horsemen are flowing free, being combed out.\n\nWhilst on the subject of the horses, I would draw attention to the representation of colour, both of the riders' horses being fleabitten or grey, whilst those in the chariot appear to be pure white. On the head of one is manifestly a grand plume of feathers, and on the other a strange kind of ornament, with backward flowing streamers, surmounted by,\nperhaps, the tied-up top-knot. The horses all appear to be stallions. But the most curious point is the introduction of stirrups. These are either of rope or of bamboo, but most probably of the latter, from the stiffness with which they stand out.\n\nEven in so small a matter as this is the skill of the artist shown; for in the prancing horse the foot pressing heavily bends the stirrup to its shape, whilst in the case of the trotting one the foot lightly placed does not spoil the curve of the bamboo or rope.\n\nThe saddle-cloths do not cover any saddle, and are, doubtless, ornamented pads, which are even now much used in the East. No girths are shown in the drawing. In the Sanchi representation, all the horses are saddled, although nowhere are stirrups to be found. The Greeks and Romans, as far as my knowledge extends, did not use them, for I have never seen them figured; although, perhaps, on the same principle that the nude was preferred to the highly-clad figure for representations, the horses were drawn as far as possible without trappings, as in the Elgin marbles.\n\nThe action of the animals is well represented when we consider the rough tool with which the incising has been effected. They have a large tassel hanging at the ear, and a species of horned erection of, perhaps, plumes on the forehead or top-knot, as has been used for State by all nations in all ages. Each is driven with two reins, four being held in one hand by the driver, and four in the other. The chariot is of a rather uncommon form, very large, and has none of the angularity so general in those of Greece and Rome. From the marking it almost looks as though the upper portion was made of basket-work. The front is ornamented by perpendicular lines of work, probably of wood; and there is a hand-rail upon which the young prince is leaning. It, however, much resembles in its general form one represented in Plate xxxiv. of Tree and Serpent Worship, from the bas-reliefs at Sanchi; and still more so one spoken of as the only one at Amravat\u00ee, and figured in Plate lxxvi. of the same work. This, however, has only two horses.\nThere is no connexion between the reins and the mouths of the horses, but the arrangement represented would seem to imply some species of bit. These were, doubtless, in use at the time to which I would assign the work, long after the time of Arrian, whose remarks are quoted by Mr. Fergusson.\n\nOver the prince, held in the left hand by his chowrie-bearer, is a very large umbrella of bamboo, neatly made, presenting no peculiarity, but very much resembling those now in use in most parts of the East. He wears no clothing above the waist, except a light scarf thrown over the shoulders, whilst the lower part of his body is covered with a dhoti, or waistcloth, as far as can be seen; neither has he any ornaments on his arms or wrists. Around his neck is a mala, or necklace, made of gems, probably of amber or turquoise, of the shape of truncated cones strung transversely through the thick end, and he would appear to have had his ears lengthened and split, as in the order of his kamphati, or, perhaps, caused to present that appearance, in consequence of the former wearing of heavy earrings, now abandoned, as we so often see in figures of Sakya Muni. Some may, however, hold that the elongation represents rings worn in the ear. I, however, think that they do not. He appears to have no head-dress, but merely his long locks twisted up into masses around his head in a neat manner.\n\nAt his left hand stands his charioteer, a character often alluded to in the four predictive signs shown to Sakya before he finally left the Palace at Kapila. This person, whether male or female, for there is little to distinguish the sex, and the dress and ornament rather seem to indicate a woman, may possibly be his wife Yasodav\u00e2. He (or she) appears to be speaking to the Prince, who looks sad and thoughtful. He wears heavy bangles, a necklace much resembling that of the master, and immense lobes or earrings almost reaching to the shoulder. Besides this, he has a fine gold chain, similar in character to that worn by the musicians, which rather favours the presumption of the charioteer being a female. A grand Turkish turban crowns his head, such as Bishop Bigandet speaks of as being worn by men at the time of\nSakya in his Life of Gautama. As before stated, four reins are held in each hand, and the right also carries a long stiff whip without any lash.\n\nBehind the Prince stands a female attendant, with the large umbrella supported with her left hand, whilst the right grasps a chowrie, or fly whisk of hair. She wears the same prodigious lobe or ear ornaments as the charioteer, with similar bangles on her wrists. Her hair is most elaborately done up in two horns, with a streamer coming through the midst of each erection, and hanging down far below the waist, whilst many (five are shown) others float on the breeze from the back of the head. Her body is bare to the waist, as was common at the date to which I would attribute this vase; whilst below, a sari, or petticoat, tightly girt round the hips, flows freely by reason of the rapid motion of the vehicle.\n\nThe whole forms a very complete and carefully drawn group, and tells its story quite graphically.\n\nIt might well represent Phralong when he saw the first of the four \"signs\" as he drove to his gardens in state, with his four beautiful white horses, accompanied by guards and musicians.\n\nImmediately behind the car rides a horseman wearing no ornament whatever. He has long slit ears, with his hair curiously twisted up about his head, and a light scarf over his shoulders, the ends of which stream behind him. Below this is a dhoti, or waistcloth, which completes his clothing.\n\nIn his right hand he carries a very curious highly-finished weapon, somewhat resembling a halberd, consisting of a long staff tipped with a spear-head. A little below the head on one side is a sharp projecting recurved instrument like a rein-cutter; and on the opposite side, still lower down, is an axe-head. I have in my researches found one or two representations of a spear with an axe on one side of the staff, but never one with this strange hook, which cannot possibly be used as an ankus, or elephant goad, the staff being too long. There are some celebrated tridents, one in Gurwhal, 21 feet high, which has the axe-head on one side; and another at\nGopeswar\u00e2, 16 feet high, with a similar appendage,\\(^1\\) which slightly reminds one of the Roman *fusces* carried by the Lictors; and upon a Bactrian (?) coin, shown me by Mr. E. Thomas, we found a weapon possibly similar, but very indistinct. The handle is neatly finished off at the bottom, and the weapon would seem to be one of the State insignia.\n\nThe second horseman has rings in his ears of a moderate size, and a scarf of another pattern, wearing only a *dh\u014d\u1e6d\u012b* in addition by way of clothing. His head is, however, covered by a handsome turban, unless, indeed, his hair is so neatly done up as exactly to resemble one, which I much doubt. He is closely followed by another Prince, or noble person, mounted on an elephant, which steps nimbly along. A male attendant sits behind him on the pad or *gudd\u012b*, for there is no howdah, the elephant being very small, holding an umbrella over him of exactly the same character as that used by the principal person, with his left hand, whilst in his right hand he grasps a *chowrie*, or fly whisk, with which he fans his master. As it is, he sits in a most uncomfortable position, and it is not clear how he balances himself.\n\nThe driver of the elephant, evidently some great man, has elongated slit ears, without earrings, like the Prince, one of the horsemen, and another attendant not yet described; and the same wild arrangement of hair as the second horseman and the chief Prince. The scarf, necklace, and *dh\u014d\u1e6d\u012b* are all the same. In his hand he carries a very long *ankus*, or goad, and he wears no bracelets. The elephant he bestrides, which is evidently reduced in size for the sake of the picture, has short ears with a prodigious trunk, which is adorned with lines of paint, and a frontlet carrying bells, which comes over the ears at the side of the head. His tail is tied up very curiously by a rope under the belly to the head. This is often done to prevent its being moved when one is getting on to the beast\u2019s back thereby, at the present day; and it would almost seem to indicate that this was a portrait of an elephant which needed to be so treated. The arrangement of the hair of the attendant is different from that of any other person in the\n\n\\(^1\\) *Vide* J.A.S., vol. v. p. 482.\npicture, and two short streamers hang down from it behind. These streamers deserve a word, for they are probably the same as the ornament carried in the hand of the priest, the *utpal\u0101 padma*, or \"water-lily jewel and tree leaf put together in the form of a nosegay,\" mentioned by Alexander Csoma K\u00f4r\u00f4se, in J.A.S. vol. vii. p. 143, marking the subdivision of Buddhism, to which the people belonged, viz., the Rahula (*sgra-gchan-hdsin*), the son of Sakya, and helping to fix the date as very early. This man also probably wears earrings of no great size, and hence not very distinctly portrayed.\n\nFollowing the elephant is a priest or *Sram\u0101\u1e47a* of some rank, holding in his left hand the ornament above described. The right side certainly, and probably the whole front of the head, is shaven, as shown by the little bristles; whilst the hair from the back is made up into two great rolls, and brought forward on the left side. The slit-elongated ear also marks this man, who has not an article of ornament upon him. He wears the scarf and the long flowing *dhot\u012b*, and, like all the others, goes barefooted.\n\nBehind him come the two female musicians. Their dress is rather difficult to describe. Around their heads are fine turbans with flowing scarfs and pendent ornaments, above described as the *utpal\u0101 padma*. They wear prodigious earrings or lobes, almost resembling dice-boxes, and reaching to their shoulders. (How these were suspended is not very clear, although the elongation of the ears may account for this in part.) They also have necklaces of amber or turquoise strung transversely like those of the men, heavy bracelets or bangles, and anklets. These last-named lie loosely on the ankles. They each have in addition a fine gold chain round the neck, which falls naturally between the fully-developed breasts, as in the dancing girl of the Bhilsa Topes, so ably figured in Gen. Cunningham's work; and they are nude to the waist, below which, and reaching to the ankle, is worn a very thin and transparent striped *sari*, or petticoat, fastened at the hips with a band and buckle, and scolloped in its lower edge.\n\nThe former of these women plays upon a *r\u012bna*, or lute, of a very curious shape, held horizontally, but somewhat re-\nsembling one in the plates of carvings at Amravat\u00ee (Plate lxxii. fig. 1, Fergusson's Tree and Serpent Worship). It also slightly resembles the Egyptian form. I have, however, not been able to meet with its exact counterpart.\n\nThe second is well represented as performing on a very long and peculiar flute, projecting at either end. Her attitude and fingering of the instrument are very good; and I have not been able anywhere to find a similar flute. Its length is from four to five feet!\n\nAll the space not occupied by the drawing is filled in with Buddhist emblems, such as small circles, chakras or wheels, vessels, flowers, the sun, fruits and boughs, giving it a particularly rich effect. Amongst these, the vessels are curious, as being of exactly the same shape as those at present in use amongst the natives of India; thus showing how little the modern Hindus have changed their forms and patterns from of old.\n\nThe lips of the vessel are engraved all round with geometrical patterns formed of lines, and are much broken. The vase is also cracked. It was, I am told, in this condition when found; but I also heard that Gen. Cunningham had broken off portions for analysis, the reports of the result of which I have not able to obtain.\n\nThe metal must, however, have been very pure, or it had never resisted corrosion as it has done.\n\nIt is well known that, from very early times, and probably during the G\u00fbpta period, Buddhist erections stood on the spot where the vase was found, which buildings have long since gone to ruin, the spot itself being now held sacred to Tril\u00f4kn\u00e2th; whilst there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the relic, of its being of very great antiquity.\n\nThe absence of Jana\u00f4s or Brahmanical threads, as well as of all teekas, or caste marks; the costumes of the parties, both men and women, nude to the waist; the arms and musical instruments\u2014all point to a very early date.\n\nGreek art had by this time permeated that part of the country, having had its head-quarters at or about Peshawur; and I see nothing in the subject to lead me to fix a later date\nthan about 200\u2014300 A.D., or during the Gupta dynasty. The drawing appears to me to indicate a period somewhat earlier than that of the carvings on the Sanchi Topes; and although I am of opinion that the scene represents Sakya himself, I am bound to admit, there is nothing in the group which might not be held to apply to any other prince of the period referred to. Many of the details distinctly point to that time, such as the flower ornament held by the Sraman\u00e2, and before described, the emblems, etc.\n\nThe drawing is fine, bold, free, and spirited; and it is much to be desired that this very interesting specimen of ancient work should be deposited at the India-house Museum, where all might see and study it. There is no inscription of any kind upon it to fix the date, so that my approximation refers rather to the date of the scene represented than to the manufacture of the vase itself. They may have been later, and the subject a reproduction of some well-known picture.\n\nThe photographs which accompany, and which need no special explanation, are executed by Mr. Griggs, of Peckham, the one from the vase itself, and the other from a larger drawing, by an artist, of the royal procession.\nART. XVIII.\u2014The Bhar Tribe. By the Rev. M. A. Sherring, LL.D., Benares. Communicated by C. Horne, M.R.A.S., late B.C.S.\n\n(Read December 4th, 1871.)\n\nThis race, variously known by the terms R\u00e2jbhar, Bharat, Bharpatwa, and Bhar, once inhabited a wide tract of country extending from Gorakhpur in Northern India to Saugor in Central India. Other tribes, such as the Cher\u00fbs, the Majhw\u00e2rs, and the K\u00f4ls, were, in places, associated with them, or contiguous to them; but there is good reason to believe that the Bhars greatly outnumbered them all. They were very powerful in Oudh; and the country lying between Benares and Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d, on either side of the Ganges, a tract of about seventy miles in length, was almost exclusively in their possession. The entire district of Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d also was originally in their hands, and traces of them are still to be seen in every pargannah, more especially in those situated across the Ganges and Jamna. Their forts there, called Bhar-d\u00eeh, some of which are of vast size, are very numerous; and they have the credit of having excavated all the deep tanks which now exist. The pargannah of Khairoga\u00f1h bears very abundant traces of their toil and enterprise. The stone fort of that name, of immense proportions, is said to have been their work.\u00b9\n\nIn the district of Bandah, on its eastern side, are extensive hill forts, which Dr. Wilton Oldham, formerly Assistant Magistrate of that district, informs me are of Cyclop\u00e6an dimensions, and are attributed to the Bhars. In particular, he mentions Lukwa, situated in the Ch\u00eeb\u00fb pargannah.\n\nVestiges of this race are found in many places in the districts of Mirz\u00e2pur, Jannpur, Azimgarh, Gh\u00e2zipur, Gorakhpur, and in the province of Oudh, where numerous embankments, tanks, subterraneous caverns, and stone forts, still exist, and\n\n\u00b9 Report of Revenue Settlement, Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d, vol. ii., part i.\ntestify to their energy and skill. The present inhabitants of Azimgarh have a tradition that their country, in the time of R\u00e2m, with whose kingdom, Ayodhya, it was formerly connected, was occupied by R\u00e2jbhars and As\u00fbrs. The Bhars have left behind them large mud forts, of which specimens may be seen at Harbanspur and Unchg\u00e2on, near the town of Azimgarh, and also at Ghori. The Kunw\u00e2r and Manghai rivers of the district seem to have been connected by a trench, called Asur\u00e2in, the work, it is said, of its primitive inhabitants. The Hari B\u00e2ndh, or dam, at Amin-nagar, in the Niz\u00e2m\u00e2b\u00e2d pargannah, is an embankment generally ascribed to them.\u00b9 The Bhars once possessed the northern portion of the present district of Gh\u00e2zipur, now divided into the pargannahs of Sh\u00e2di\u00e2b\u00e2d, Pachotar, Zuh\u00fbr\u00e2b\u00e2d, while another occupied the fort of Laknesar-dih, the deserted village of Laknesar.\u00b2\n\nYet the race, in association with other aboriginal tribes, was not confined to this united tract, but was once spread abroad in various directions in that part of the country. \u201cThe Hindu land-owning tribes,\u201d says Dr. Oldham, \u201call agree in stating that at the time of the first immigration of their forefathers, the entire country\u2014except a few tracts held by Brahmans so far as the forests had been cleared\u2014was occupied by aborigines, not of the Aryan race, who were in the habit of eating the flesh of swine, and using intoxicating drinks, and were called Seorees, Bhars, and Cher\u00fbs.\u201d\u00b3 This tradition is current, says the same writer, throughout the Benares Province, Oudh, and Behar.\n\nHow far the extensive District of Gorakhpur was occupied by the Bhars is uncertain. We know that the Kansik tribe of R\u00e2jpoots ousted them from a portion of their territory, and retain possession of it to the present day.\n\nRespecting the Bhars of Oudh, Mr. W. P. Carnegy, Deputy-Commissioner of Fyz\u00e1b\u00e2d, remarks that the ruins of their former masonry forts are to be traced by scores in\n\n\u00b9 Settlement Report of the Azimgarh District, vol. i., sec. 23, 24.\n\u00b2 Dr. Oldham\u2019s Memoir of the Gh\u00e2zip\u00fbr District, part i., p. 46.\n\u00b3 Dr. Oldham\u2019s Memoir of the Gh\u00e2zip\u00fbr District, part i., p. 46.\nour districts, and the name of their former capital, where they were finally overthrown by the Mahomedans, after being, according to popular tradition, artfully plied with spirits, was Kasbhawanpur, the modern town of Sult\u00e2npur, destroyed by us after the re-occupation of the province.\u201d\n\nThe Bhar r\u00e1j, or dominion, included the whole of Eastern Oudh. Every great natural work or ancient relic there is attributed, says Mr. C. A. Elliott, in his Chronicles of Oonao, either to the Devil or the Bhars. He states, moreover, that \u201calmost every town whose name does not end in pur, or \u00e1b\u00e1d, or mow, or is not distinctly derivable from a proper name, is claimed by tradition, in the east of Oudh, as a Bhar town. The district of Bharaich is (if we may trust its traditions) their oldest abode, and the name of the town of Bharaich is said to be derived from them. From thence they spread southwards through the districts of Fyz\u00e2b\u00e2d and Sult\u00e2npur, and it is in the latter district that they maintained themselves latest, being only finally extirpated in the reign of Alamgir. It is said that some of their number may be found there even now, living a wild gipsy life in the jungles.\u201d\n\nThe district of Mirz\u00e2pur exhibits traces and remains of this people to a greater extent than of any other tribe. The pargannah of Bhadohee, or more properly Bhardoh\u00ee, is called after them. Mr. Duthoit, late deputy-superintendent of the family domains of the Maharaja of Benares, in his recent elaborate report on this pargannah, says that traces of the Bhars abound on all sides, in the form of old tanks and village forts. \u201cOne cannot go for three miles in any direction without coming upon some of the latter.\u201d Their tanks are Suraj-bedi, that is, longer from east to west than from north to south; and thereby distinguishable from modern tanks, which are Chandr-bedi, and lie north and south. The bricks found in the Bhar-d\u00eehs, or forts, are of enormous dimensions, and frequently measure nineteen inches in length, eleven in breadth, and two and a quarter in thickness.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. P. Carnegy\u2019s Races of Oudh, p. 22.\n2 Chronicles of Oonao, p. 26.\nquality and size they are similar to bricks often seen in ancient Buddhist buildings.\\footnote{Report on the Bhadohee Pargannah, p. 2.}\n\nThis \\textit{pargannah} stretches along the north bank of the Ganges; yet on the south side of that river, likewise, Bhar forts and towns are met with. One of their principal cities was situated about five miles to the west of the modern city of Mirz\u00e2pur, and was evidently of great extent. Its brick and stone \\textit{d\u00e9bris} is scattered over the fields for several miles. This old city is called Pamp\u00e2p\u00fbr\u00e2 by the people now living in the neighbourhood. It is probable that the original name has been lost, and that this name was given to it by the R\u00e2jpoots who took the country from the Bhars. From its size, and the substantial nature of the buildings which, judging from the relics, it contained, the city must have been of sufficient importance to be the capital of the country. It included within its circuit the ancient town of Vindhyachal, famous in the Pur\u00e2nas, and still celebrated throughout a great part of India for its shrine of the goddess Vindhyeswari, which many thousands of pilgrims from every quarter visit yearly. To the east of the town are the remains of the fort, from which spot, in a westerly direction, \\textit{d\u00e9bris} is found in great abundance.\n\nTradition says that the city once possessed one hundred and fifty temples, all of which were destroyed by that indomitable enemy of idolatry, the Emperor Aurungzebe. This is perhaps an exaggeration; yet that there were formerly magnificent temples on this spot is indisputable. Below the Ashtbh\u00fbj\u00ee bungalow, a sanatorium erected on a spur of the ridge immediately above the site of the ancient city, by a public-spirited native gentleman of Mirz\u00e2pur, for the especial benefit of its European residents, is a massive square building, having the appearance of a fort. It is, however, a Hindu monastery, with a temple on its summit, reputed to be of some sanctity. This edifice has in its walls, breastworks, and foundations, a multitude of carved stones and figures, while many more cover the ground in its vicinity. The sculptures found here, and elsewhere in many\nplaces among the outlying fields for a great distance, are not of modern Hindu style; indeed, in point of design and skilfulness of execution, are far superior to the productions of Hindus of later times. Some of the figures are of that curious type described, hesitatingly, by Mr. Fergusson, in his \"Tree and Serpent Worship in India,\" as Dasyas, or aborigines, in contradistinction to the immigrant tribes of Hindus. They are readily distinguishable by their peculiar head-dress and long pointed beards. They constitute, however, but a small portion of the figures, which are for the most part representations of Hindu men and women, with most elaborate turbans and head-dresses, while exceedingly few apparently are of a sacred character. It is probable that nearly all these relics point to a later period of Bhar history, when Hindus had come and settled among them. The contrast between the long-bearded figures and the Hindu figures is very striking. It is questionable whether at the date of most of these sculptures the Bhars were still in possession of the country; indeed, I am inclined to the supposition that it had in part, or in whole, already passed from them into the hands of the R\u0101jpoots, who are known to have been the rulers over this tract for a period of five hundred years. At the same time, the position and attitude of the Bhar figures on these sculptures indicate that at the time of their execution the Bhars were still a people of importance. It is right to add, however, that a few of the sculptures, yet only a few, represent the Bhars as the superior race, and attached to the Buddhist or Jain religion.\n\nMy friend C. J. Sibold, Esq., of Mirz\u0101pur, has made an excellent collection of sculptures from the numerous remains at Pamp\u0101p\u016br\u0101, from which a few admirable drawings by a native artist have been selected for description. I have chiefly chosen those which exhibit the bearded figures. Some of these are evidently of a sacred character. It will be observed that the cast of countenance of all the bearded figures is of a peculiar type, differing considerably from the Hindu countenances, with which, in some instances, they are associated, and also from Hindu faces of the present day.\n10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches from lower edge of chin to middle of forehead.\n1 foot 5 inches from inner point of one ear across the bridge of the nose to inner part of the other ear.\n1 foot 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches from lower part of head dress to the apex.\n2 feet 2 inches from lower edge of chin to the apex of the head dress.\nFigures Nos. 1 and 2 are probably Bhar R\u00e2jas; the same may be said of the bearded figure No. 3: the other figures in which are of a Hindu cast. Moreover, while the Bhar is seated, and occupies an honourable position, the Hindu to the left is standing, and is probably an attendant. The sharply-pointed beards of the Bhars in most of these sketches are very curious, being altogether unlike anything seen among the natives of India of modern times; their head-dresses, too, are singular\u2014the lower part of that of No. 1 looks like a crown.\n\nThe bearded figure in No. 4\u2014judging from his elaborate turban and long earrings\u2014is a person of some distinction. His short beard has the appearance of a neckerchief. The artist has, I suspect, hardly caught its true expression; the Hindu attendant is presenting something kneeling. In the compartment to the left, the figure with a Hindu countenance is seated cross-legged; it is four-armed, and therefore a deity, perhaps the household god of the Bhar chief. If this be so, it shows that the sketch represents a period when the Bhars worshipped Hindu idols.\n\nFigures Nos. 5 and 6 seem to be at their devotions: one has his hands united together open, according to the fashion adopted by Hindus now-a-days, as expressive of adoration or obeisance; the other has one elbow resting on hand. But we are not left in the dark either as to the act of worship or as to the object reverenced. No. 5 occupies a lower niche of a series of sculptures, the most prominent of which is a large and well-defined figure of Buddha seated. The head of this figure, which has not been figured, is manifestly of a genuine Buddhist type, with curly hair and nimbus. Moreover, it has the conventional elephant depicted to the right above, so frequently found in ancient Buddhist sculptures. An interesting question is thus incidentally started, namely, what was the primitive religion of the Bhars? In the instance before us, Buddha is the object being worshipped. If such is the case, we are carried back to a period before the R\u00e2jpoots had arrived with their Hindu deities, and had induced the Bhars, whether by fair means or foul, to\nembrace Hinduism, as, from information derived from some of the sculptures, we have every reason to suppose they subsequently did.\n\nFigure No. 6 is in contemplation. He is not a devotee, as some might perhaps be inclined to imagine; for he has several bracelets and armlets on his wrist and arm; nevertheless, it is probable that he is religiously employed. Figures Nos. 7 and 8, display a considerable difference of head-dress. Their physiognomies are not of a Hindu type; the second has his beard closely cut, though still well defined. The head, No. 7, is remarkable for the size of its earrings. The small figure, No. 8,* has a head-dress, and what seem to be side-ornaments, different from all the rest. In appearance he is worshipping a round object before him on a low altar. Is it a relic casket?\n\nThe central figure in No. 9, compared with the remaining figures, is of colossal proportions. Being headless, it is impossible to speak about it with precision. The stumps of its four arms indicate that it was a divinity, but of what religion? The elephant and deer were sacred animals with the Buddhists, and are very frequently found on their sculptures. The four arms, however, seem to point to a Hindu deity. Of the thirteen subordinate human figures, the three upper ones are beardless, and most likely represent Hindus. Two of these are worshipping the central figure; the ten lower figures have all pointed beards, and present a great similarity of physiognomy. Those in an erect posture are perhaps intended to represent priests, or, it may be, men of rank in attendance on the god; one of them holds in his hand a flag, and another grasps a kind of club. All have on their heads a high conical cap or turban. The four-headed personages seated below display a very different style of head-dress, and seem to be of a humbler position in life. It is remarkable that the erect figures and the divinity also are adorned with what has the appearance of the sacred thread, while the sitting figures above and below are destitute of it. The Bhar figures, Nos. 1 and 4, have the thread also; but Nos. 2 and 3\n\n* Not figured.\nare without it. I am at a loss to explain this very singular circumstance. My own impression is, that the Bhars learnt the custom of wearing the thread from the R\u00e2jpoots who came amongst them. But this must have been done before the Bhars were subdued, and while the R\u00e2jpoots were mere servants to them; for it is hardly likely that the R\u00e2jpoots, after they had subjugated the Bhars, would have suffered them to wear a sacred badge which only Hindus of good caste were permitted to assume.\n\nFigures Nos. 10 and 10\u00bd* are four-armed divinities, yet they exhibit the Bhar type of countenance, seen in Nos. 8 and 9; their conical caps and pointed beards are much like those observed in the erect figure of No. 12. Both are decorated with the sacred cord. The figure to the left is four feet four inches in height. The other has a massive jewelled ornament on the upper part of one of his left arms.\n\nThe sitting figure, No. 10\u00be,* with four hands, is, I suppose, either intended for Buddha, or for one of the twenty-four subordinate divinities of the Jain religion. The hair is gathered up into a knot and tied by a fold. The double-beaded garland over the chest, passing round the waist, must not be confounded with the sacred thread.\n\nNo. 10\u00bd* presents the head of Buddha, already referred to. The entire figure seated, together with various emblematical figures on the sides and base, is a beautiful specimen of ancient sculpture. From the circumstance that one of the Bhar bearded figures of this series occupies a niche at the base of this sculpture, there is good ground for supposition, as already remarked, that the ancient Bhars were, to some extent, Buddhists.\n\nIt will be readily perceived that the beautiful figure No. 11 displays a very different countenance from any of the Bhar figures described above. I believe it to be a likeness of a Gaharw\u00e2r R\u00e2jpoot, probably of a chief of the family that took possession of the Bhar territory of Kantit. The conical head-dress is of the same description as that worn by Bhar chiefs in the sketches already noticed, but is more ornamented\n\n* Not figured.\nand magnificent. The figure is a divinity, as is manifest from the third eye set in the middle of the forehead, and represents, very probably, Sheva as Trilochau, or the Three-eyed. As a specimen of art the relic is worthy of study. It is of colossal size, and originally belonged to a statue some ten or twelve feet in height.\n\nMr. Woodburn, Settlement Officer in Oudh, in his Report on the Mangalsi *pargannah* of the Fyz\u00e2b\u00e2d District, has some interesting, though somewhat fanciful, observations on the nature and use of the Bhar forts in that part of Oudh. \"Bhar forts, as they are called, are common in the *pargannah*. They are in general simple rounded mounds, more or less lofty, strewn with broken brick. The mounds appear to be in the main artificial, and their area is never large. If the dwellings of the Bhars were confined to the mound, the population of that day must have been very scanty. This is hardly consistent with the revenue returns of Akbar's reign for the neighbourhood; and yet, according to the corroborative accounts of the R\u00e2jpoot tribes, the Bhars were dominant till Akbar's time. Impressed, however, with that idea, and feeling it hard to believe that a small population, living on an exuberant soil, could have lived in a state of constant strife, I conceived that the mounds were possibly constructed as a sanitary precaution against the malaria of a region of marshes and forests. The theory is scarcely justified by the position of some of the mounds with which I became acquainted. But, however this may be, there can be no doubt a great change has taken place in the habits of the people since the days of the mound-makers. Brick strongholds have been succeeded by clay huts; and, as in the case of Kal\u00e2parpur (where there is a Bhar fort), the people have formed the notion that evil and misfortune haunt the dwelling-places of their forerunners. It is strange how the name of the Bhars should have adhered to places that now know them no more.\"\n\nThat the Bhars were not a barbarous race, but were partially civilized, is sufficiently proved by the numerous works of skill which they have left. Their massive forts, found\nthroughout the country which they once inhabited, testify to their warlike propensities; yet they were probably erected chiefly as means of defence and as places of refuge: for in their later history it is certain they were exposed to fierce attacks from their R\u00e2jpoot neighbours. The same energy and talent which they exhibited in defending themselves against their enemies they also displayed in more peaceful pursuits. Whence this people obtained their civilization, which placed them much above the condition of many other aboriginal tribes, it is hard to say, unless we suppose that it had its origin in themselves. I know not why we should be so ready always to ascribe all the ancient civilization of India to successive troops of Hindu immigrants. The more I investigate the matter, the stronger do my convictions become, that the Hindu tribes have learnt much from the aboriginal races: but that, in the course of ages, these races have been so completely subdued, and have been so ground down by oppression, and treated with such extreme rigour and scorn, that, in the present condition of abject debasement in which we find them, we have no adequate means for judging of their original genius and power. Mr. Thomason, late Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, in his Report on the Ceded Portion of the District of Azimgarh, says of the Bhars and the tribes associated with them, \"The inhabitants of the country, by whatever name they are distinguished, were a powerful and industrious people, as is evident by the large works they have left behind them.\"\u00b9\n\nHow long prior to the R\u00e2jpoot invasions the Bhars had occupied this tract of country cannot be ascertained; yet the prosperity to which they had attained and the civilization they had acquired are sound reasons for thinking that they had held possession of it for a protracted period. Six, or at the most seven, hundred years ago, the whole of the Benares Provinces, a large portion of the Province of Oudh, and perhaps a considerable portion of outlying territories, were beyond all dispute chiefly in the hands of the Bhars and other aboriginal non-Aryan tribes. The fall of Kanouj and\n\n\u00b9Mr. Thomason's Report on the Ceded Portion of the District of Azimgarh, p. 13.\nDelhi at the end of the twelfth century set free the great R\u00e2jpoot families, and sent them wandering all over the country in quest of new homes. These came in contact with the aboriginal tribes, and either subdued them at once, or, as was probably more frequently the case, obtained employment and lands from them in the first instance, and afterwards, as opportunity served, by degrees seized their possessions, overthrew their owners, and expelled them. This process was a long or short one, according to circumstances. In some instances, several hundred years elapsed before the end was gained. Yet finally the same conclusion was attained everywhere.\n\nThe traditions of all the land-owning tribes of the tracts referred to accord with these statements, bearing united testimony to the fact, that a few hundred years ago the middle Ganges valley was occupied by non-Aryan aboriginal races. The history of the period preceding the R\u00e2jpoot immigrations is partly historical and partly conjectural. During the prevalence of Buddhism in Northern India, the Aryan races appear to have been everywhere dominant. Some of the aboriginal tribes blended with them, though to what extent is uncertain. As Hinduism began to re-assert its authority and claims, on the decay of Buddhism, a fierce struggle seems to have arisen between the two religious factions. Yet how far the Aryans had cultivated the soil and spread themselves out into villages and towns is, strictly speaking, unknown. Whether, indeed, the country was well or only scantily populated is equally uncertain; most probably the latter supposition is the correct one. This, however, is tolerably clear, that the aboriginal tribes were in a subject condition. We have trustworthy information respecting the kingdom of Benares and a portion of that country of which Ayodhya was the capital. They were governed by Hindus. Both were originally chief seats of Hinduism; afterwards, in both places, Buddhism was very powerful; and, lastly, in both kingdoms Hinduism became once more in the ascendant. Nevertheless, the Aryan race, in its tremendous efforts to shake off the Buddhist creed, greatly\nenfeebled itself, and was consequently unable to cope with the aboriginal tribes, which, taking advantage of the religious and political strife which was destroying the life of the Hindu nation, endeavoured to regain their ancient lands, from which, ages before, they had been driven away into the forests and mountains.\n\nThe remarks of Dr. Oldham respecting the district known by the modern name of Gh\u00e2zipur are equally applicable to the whole of the Benares Provinces. \"On the downfall of Buddhism in this part of India, the distinction between the Aryans and the aborigines became as marked as ever. The former, weakened by their internecine war, were unable to hold the country; the latter, removed from the civilizing influences to which they had been subjected, relapsed wholly or partially into barbarism; and hence it was that this district, which thirteen hundred years ago formed an important part of a civilized Aryan monarchy, eight hundred years ago was under the sway of a number of petty semi-barbarous aboriginal chiefs, and had a very small Aryan population; while, on the other hand, the upper valley of the Ganges was filled with a teeming population of Hindus, who were in a position to send out colonies even before the coming of the Mussulmans, but who on their coming were compelled to do so.\"\u00b9 In this passage Dr. Oldham, I think, somewhat under-rates the civilization of the aboriginal tribes, which, as before remarked, judging from existing remains, was considerable.\n\nTo the same purport are the observations of Mr. C. A. Elliott respecting the changes in the distribution of the races of Oudh. The two periods in the history of that country, namely, Aryan and post-Aryan, he describes as follows: \"When the Aryan race,\" he says, \"invaded the Gangetic valley and the Surajbansi settled in Ayodhya, the natural resource for the aborigines would be to fly to the hills, and find refuge in their impenetrable fastnesses, girded about with the deathly Terai. When the curtain rises again, we find Ayodhya destroyed, the Surajbansi utterly vanished,\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Oldham's Statistical Memoir of the Gh\u00e2zip\u00fbr District, p. 49.\nand a great extent of country ruled over by aborigines, called Cher\u00fbs in the far east, Bhars in the centre, and Rajpusis in the west. This great revolution seems to be satisfactorily explained by the conjecture, that the Bhars, Cher\u00fbs, etc., were the aborigines whom the Aryans had driven to the hills, and who, swarming down from thence not long after the beginning of our era, overwhelmed the Aryan civilization, not only in Sahetan and the other northern towns, but in Ayodhya itself, drove the Surajbansis under Kanak Sen to emigrate into distant Gujerat, and spread over all the plain between the Himalayas and that spur of the Vindhya Range which passes through the south of Mirz\u00e2pur.\"\u00b9\n\nThese aboriginal races, having once re-entered the tracts of country which they had wrested from the Aryan tribes, settled upon them, and remained comparatively unmolested for a long period extending over hundreds of years. All this is plain when it is considered how firm was the hold which they had on the country when the wave of R\u00e2jpoot immigration began to flow in upon them. Their cities and towns, their industrial arts, their huge earthworks, their canals and trenches, connecting rivers, and so forth, are irrefragable proofs of their permanence and prosperity.\n\nBut it must not be imagined that the land was cleared and cultivated to the extent in which we now see it. On the contrary, it is likely that not only during this period of non-Aryan occupation of this portion of India, but also during the preceding period of Aryan occupation, the country had not been largely brought under cultivation, and that immense forests abounded, extending over many miles. My own conviction is, that only in comparatively recent times, especially since the reign of Akbar, have the vast plains of Northern India been subjected to the plough and the harrow. The Emperor Baber, the grandfather of Akbar, in his Memoirs, says that while at Chunar, a lion, a rhinoceros, and a wild buffalo were seen close on the edge of his camp, and that many elephants roamed in the jungle around Chunar, and\n\n\u00b9 Mr. C. A. Elliott's Chronicles of Oonao, p. 27.\napparently even as far as and beyond Benares. Elephants are known to have frequented the jungle between Chunar and Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d in the sixteenth century; and the hills to the south of the Ganges must at that time have been almost unapproachable.\n\nIt is certain, therefore, that at the time when the Bhars and other industrious aboriginal races planted their villages and cultivated the lands around them, vast tracts infested by wild beasts remained uncleared. They inhabited, in short, an illimitable forest, which they cleared in places and cultivated, subduing the untamed land, providing against dearth by digging splendid tanks, banking up morasses, utilizing water-courses, and thus laying the foundations of social happiness and comfort. \"All inquiry,\" says Mr. G. Ricketts, \"shows that the civilization of this district, namely, Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d, and its reclamation from the primitive jungle, was of comparatively recent date, that is, within four hundred and fifty years. Very few of the Mahomedans claim descent from the followers of Shahab-ud-din; but few Hindus date back beyond the reign of Jai-Chand, of Kanouj, whose followers, when defeated by Shahab-ud-din, populated a portion of this district; but almost all state that their ancestors took possession of those jungle tracts which form their present estates within this period.\"\u00b9 If our own remarks respecting the social condition of the Bhars be correct, the estimate Mr. Ricketts forms of the cultivation of this tribe, and of others in this neighbourhood, is altogether unsatisfactory.\n\nSir Henry Elliot considers it strange that so little notice is taken of the Bhars in the Pur\u00e2nas. The fact may be accounted for in two ways: in the first place, Brahmanical writers generally speak of the Dasyas and Asuryas, and all other non-Hindu races, with superciliousness and contempt, and consequently rarely exhibit a particle of interest in their welfare; and in the second place, the abandonment of a considerable tract of country on the part of the Aryans, who\n\n\u00b9 Census Report of the North-Western Provinces for 1865, vol. i., Appendix B., p. 127.\noccupied them, or their expulsion therefrom by aboriginal races, was an act of such little honour that it was natural not only that the circumstance should not be referred to in records devoted to the purposes of the Hindu tribes, but also that the aborigines themselves who had profited by it should be unnoticed. Sir H. Elliot conjectures, however, that an obscure reference to the Bhars is to be found in the Brahma Pur\u00e2na, where it is said, among \u201cthe descendants of Jayadhwaja are the Bharats, who, it is added, are not commonly specified from their great number. So also the Harivansa says of the Bharats, i. p. 157, \u2018They form an immense family, whose numbers it is impossible to mention.\u2019 Or they may, perhaps, be the Bhargas of the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata, subdued by Bhim Sen, on his eastern expedition.\u201d\n\nWith all this industry and capacity, the Bhars were destined to perish. The chief cause of their destruction was doubtless, as already stated, the success of the Mahomedan invasions of India, whereby the great R\u00e2jpoot rulers of Kanouj and Delhi were overthrown, and the R\u00e2jpoot tribes generally of Upper India coming into collision with a foe stronger than themselves, were compelled to surrender their old possessions and to seek out new homes. Being driven from their own countries, they fled into the more secure regions of the east, where, coming in contact with aboriginal tribes, they gradually subdued them.\n\nIn the Gh\u00e2zipur and Azimgarh districts a fierce and prolonged contest was carried on between the Bhars and the Sengarh R\u00e2jpoots, from Phaphund in the District of Etawah. These latter first entered the northern part of Gh\u00e2zipur, in the employment of the Bhar Raja who resided there. After a time, receiving some provocation from the Raja, they killed him, and endeavoured to seize his territory. The Bhars, however, bravely defended their lands; but the superior military skill of their enemies was more than a match for their courage and numbers, and they were obliged to submit to the yoke of the conqueror. The Sengarhs had two chiefs, Hari Thakur and Bir Thakur. The descendants of the former\n\n1 Elliot's Supplemental Glossary, p. 83.\noccupy the Laknesar *pargannah*, while those of the latter are found partly in the Zuh\u00fbr\u00e2b\u00e2d *pargannah* of the Gh\u00e2zipur District, and partly in a portion of Sikandarpur, in the Azimgarh District. They reckon fifteen generations since their arrival in these parts, which shows that the Bhar rule lasted until a comparatively recent period.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe extensive *pargannah* of Kantit, in the Mirz\u00e2pur District, derives its name, according to tradition, from the famous R\u00e2ja Karn, who, it is said, came on a *tirth*, or pilgrimage, to the island of Ram Gyah, in the Ganges, near Vindhyachal. Karn-*tirth* has been contracted into Kantit. Formerly this tract was in the possession of the Bhars, but was wrested from them by the Gaharw\u00e2r R\u00e2jpoots, under their chief, G\u00fbdhan Deo, of the family of R\u00e2ja Jai-Chand, of Kanouj, who massacred the Bhar ruler, together with his relations and attendants. The capital of the Bhar kingdom in these parts was, I conjecture, the extensive city of Pamp\u00e2p\u00fbr\u00e2, from which the sculptures were brought which have already been described. G\u00fbdhan Deo built forts on his domains, portions of which are still standing. This chief also took from the Bhars the lands of Khair\u00e2ga\u00f1h\u2014now a *pargannah* in the Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d District\u2014which afterwards fell to one of his sons. The number *chaur\u00e2si*, or eighty-four, was applied to so many villages. Hence there is a Tuppeh Chaur\u00e2si, or sub-division, consisting of eighty-four villages, both in the *pargannah* of Kantit and Khair\u00e2ga\u00f1h. This family became very powerful, and spread over a wide extent of country, occupying large tracts in the districts of Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d, Mirz\u00e2pur, Jaunpur, and Benares. The present R\u00e2ja of Manda, one of G\u00fbdhan Deo\u2019s descendants, possesses a small portion only of this territory; yet it consists of six hundred and seventy-five square miles.\\(^2\\) It has been said that the Gaharw\u00e2r R\u00e2jpoots once ruled from old Kanouj to Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d and Mirz\u00e2pur; but this, perhaps, is only conjecture.\n\nTo the north of the Ganges, in what is now the Badoh\u00ee\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Dr. Oldham\u2019s Statistical Memoir of the Gh\u00e2zip\u00fbr District, chap. iii. sec. ix.\n\n\\(^2\\) Mr. C. Raikes\u2019 Settlement Records of Kantit Pargannah, sec. 4. Report of Revenue Settlement, Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d, vol. ii., part i. sec. 29.\npargannah, the Bhar principality was destroyed by the Monus R\u00e2jpoots, who came from Amber, or old Jaipur, where the elder branch of the clan still exists. The tradition of the circumstance\u2014universally believed in the neighbourhood\u2014is as follows:\u2014Five persons of the Mon race undertook to perform a pilgrimage from their own country to Benares. Passing through the Bhar territory, they were attracted by its advantages, and determined to remain there, and to settle among its inhabitants. They were joined by other members of their tribe, whom they invited over. As they increased in numbers and importance, the Bhars sought to make alliances with them; but their overtures being discountenanced, disputes at length arose on the subject of intermarriage which increased to blows. This seems to have been the signal for a general attack upon the Bhars, and in the struggle which ensued the Monus people were so successful that they not only completely subjugated the aborigines, but utterly destroyed them. At the present day scarcely a Bhar is to be found from one extremity of the pargannah to the other, so absolute and entire has been their extermination.\n\nFortune, however, is a fickle goddess, and the fate of the Monus R\u00e2jpoots of Bhadoh\u00ee, and also of the Gaharw\u00e2r R\u00e2jpoots of Kantit, affords a notable instance of her inconstancy. The former, calling in the aid of Pirthipat Singh, R\u00e2ja of Part\u00e2bg\u00e2rh, to settle their family disputes, fell into his power; and, in the year 1751, the pargannah passed from his hands into those of Balwant Singh, R\u00e2ja of Benares, with whose descendants it still remains. This powerful and ambitious chieftain also obtained possession of the Kantit lands, driving out the Gaharw\u00e2r R\u00e2ja, Vikramajit, who, with his attendants, sought safety in flight. For nearly five hundred years the R\u00e2ja and his predecessors had occupied the country. On the rebellion of R\u00e2ja Cheit Singh, of Benares, Warren Hastings sent for R\u00e2ja Gobindjit, son of Vikramajit, from his hiding-place, for the purpose of restoring to him his patrimonial estate of Kantit. The new R\u00e2ja of Benares, however, had sufficient influence with the British Government to hinder its restoration; and he only received\na tenth part of its original receipts. His successors now reside in the old Gaharw\u00e2r Fort of Bijaipur, the domains of which were afterwards given as a commutation of the tenth. The prestige of the ancient Gaharw\u00e2r family in the flourishing commercial city of Mirz\u00e2pur is very great; and when the Mutiny was at its height, the Government wisely availed themselves of it in preserving order among the people.\u00b9\n\nIt is greatly to the credit of the R\u00e2ja of Benares, that during the time of his occupancy of the Kantit estate, he exerted himself most energetically in promoting the prosperity of the new and rising city of Mirz\u00e2pur. He sent over traders of various kinds from Benares, and a detachment of horse and foot was stationed there for the security of its inhabitants. The trade of the city rapidly increased, and it is not too much to say that its present important position as one of the chief centres of trade in this province is mainly the result of the R\u00e2ja\u2019s enterprise.\u00b2\n\nAgain, in the district of Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d several tribes of R\u00e2jpoots at various times ejected the Bhars. For instance, the Bais R\u00e2jpoots are found in Jhansa pargannah; the Monus R\u00e2jpoots, in Kawai; the Sonak, in Meh; the Tessyal, in Sikandra; and the Nauwak, in Nawab Gunj. The Bisen R\u00e2jpoots have settled in Karra, and Atharban in the Doab.\u00b3\n\nThe Bais R\u00e2jpoots of Oudh were very ruthless in their treatment of these industrious aborigines. Mr. Patrick Carnegy, in his \u201cHistorical Sketch of Fyz\u00e2b\u00e2d,\u201d gives a particular account of the successful raids by members of the Bais tribe in that part of Oudh now known as the district of Fyz\u00e2b\u00e2d. The Bais of Malethu overthrew and dispossessed the Bhars only two hundred years ago; whilst the Bhars of Sohwal and R\u00fbr\u00fb aided in the suppression of the Bhars four hundred years since. The Bais of Uchh\u00e2pali did the same about the same period. The Bais of R\u00e2mp\u00fbr Bhagun Tikvi fought the Bhars in the time of the Emperor Jeh\u00e2ngir.\n\n\u00b9 Report of the Bhadoh\u00ee Pargannah, pp. 4, 5, 8.\n\u00b2 The same.\n\u00b3 Report of Revenue Settlement, Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d, vol. ii., part i., sec. 45. Settlement Report of the Azimg\u00e2rh District, vol. i., sec. 24.\nBais of Gonda took service under the Bhar chief some three hundred years back, embraced the opportunity of killing him, and seized his estates. The great Bais families holding lands in the *pargannah* of Mangalsi expelled the Bhars from two to three hundred years ago. The Mahomedans residing there state that Mangal Sen, from whose name the word Mangalsi is derived, was a Bhar.\n\nI have already referred to the territory in the Gorakhpur District, now occupied by the Kansik R\u0101jpoots, and formerly occupied by the Bhars, who were driven out from their lands or destroyed, like the rest of their race.\n\nThe R\u0101jpoot tribes, although the principal, were not the only enemies of the Bhars. The Mahomedans also at various times settled in many places on their lands. In the Allah\u0101b\u0101d District the *pargannahs* of Chail and Kar\u0101l\u012b are almost entirely in the occupation of Mahomedan proprietors. Being near the city itself in which the Nazim, or chief local officer, and his underlings resided, it is not remarkable that these *pargannahs* should have fallen a prey to their cupidity. When the kingdom of Jaunpur was established, in the fourteenth century, all this part of the country formed a portion of the King of Jaunpur\u2019s dominions, and remained so until the downfall of the last king, Hussain Khan, towards the end of the fifteenth century.\n\nIf the dates given above be correct, it is plain that the Bhars, not a great while ago, were the lords of the soil over a considerable portion of the Benares Province and the Province of Oudh. It does not appear that at any time they possessed sovereign power; it is probable that they peacefully acknowledged the supremacy of the reigning monarch in these provinces for the time being, first of the Kings of Kanouj; then of the early Mahomedan Emperors; then of the Kings of Jaunpur, and lastly of the Mogul Emperors. Whether in the dark middle ages of Indian history, prior to the invasions of Mahmud of Ghazn\u012b and his hosts, and after the fall and expulsion of the Buddhists, the Bhars were ever independent rulers, is a problem which cannot be solved.\n\nYet what has become of the old Bhar race? Their fate\nhas been most disastrous, inasmuch as they have not only been robbed of their lands, and of all authority incident to wealth and rank, but their conquerors have plunged them in the lowest depth of humiliation. Their present condition proves conclusively that they were ever regarded by their oppressors as fair game, to be hunted down and destroyed. Not content with doing their utmost to exterminate the Bhars during long centuries of grinding tyranny, they have degraded the survivors of the race to the most abject condition in the social scale. Here and there, in many places, as will presently be shown, Bhars are still found; but, with few exceptions, their state is one of great social ignominy. They are largely employed to tend swine, an office which in India only the most despised and disreputable classes will undertake. Perhaps this office is a remnant of the old habits of the Bhars, and indicates, as it is indeed almost certain, that their ancestors ate pork and the flesh of other animals. By some persons the Bhars are included in the caste of P\u00e0s\u00ees, one of the most ignoble of the non-Hindu castes.\n\nIt would be interesting to learn the history of the degradation of a race of people, of enterprise and skill, of originality and singular practical ability, which it is evident once characterized them in no ordinary degree. Their supplanters, whether R\u00e2jpoots, Brahmans, or Mahomedans, though more civilized and refined, are not to be compared with the nobler aborigines, whom they have ruined, in regard to the great works of public utility which have been executed in the land. In default of such historical information\u2014which, indeed, there is little probability of our ever acquiring\u2014the only explanation of the circumstance that I can give is, that their present miserable condition is the result of the pride and intolerance of their conquerors. As a non-Aryan tribe they were considered impure, and altogether unfit to be the companions of the twice-born and their associates. Their industry, their natural gifts, their energy and perseverance, constituted, in the judgment of these high-caste intolerants, no claim to their consideration; on the contrary, may have furnished a reason, in addition to their religious uncleanness,\nfor depressing them as low as possible. The mental superiority of the Aryan races over the Bhars, and other similar aboriginal tribes, admits of no dispute; and it is equally certain that, in industry and practical sagacity, they were barely equal to them. This is proved by the fact, patent to all residing in those parts of India to which special reference has been made in this essay, that there are more numerous remains of their mechanical ability and scientific attainments in that tract than of all the Rajpoots and other Aryan tribes that have succeeded them. In the view of the writer, special measures should be adopted by philanthropists for the social and political regeneration of the Bhar, the Seori\u2014which has suffered a like degradation\u2014and other aboriginal tribes. Well-informed and generous Hindus, who are deriving incalculable benefits from British rule in India\u2014aspirants for political distinctions and favours, men animated, or professing to be animated, with noble desires for the enlightenment of their fellow-countrymen\u2014may fairly be called upon to render efficient aid in this great enterprise. Nor should the Government withhold a helping hand. It has paid little practical attention to these despised classes hitherto. This is a grave though unintentional error. Why should not the Bhar and Seori have a chance to recover their lost social position? The Government has it in its power to afford them this chance. Has it yet the will?\n\nA few of the Bhar tribe, although they may not have saved themselves from social contempt, are still in possession of property and comparative independence. While not a single Bhar landed proprietor exists in the Bhadohi pargannah of the Mirzapur District, there are two Bhar land-holders, or were not long since, in the neighbouring pargannah of Kantit, in the same district. But these men, disloyal to their tribe, though wise in their generation, feeling the grievous burden of their social position, affect a Rajpoot title, notwithstanding that it is well known they are directly descended from the Bhars. The extensive tract in the Vindhya Hills, known as the Talluq\u00e2 of Koindih, belongs to a Bhar clan.\n\nIn the Allahabad District this unfortunate race seems to\nhave been well nigh extinguished. There are, however, three Bhar villages in the Khair\u00e2garh pargannah, namely, Majera, Kaly\u00e2npur, and Omraicha, the families of which are said to have right to six others, although in reality only occupying these three. It is probable that the Bhars, driven away from more civilized regions, retreated into the wild jungle of Khari\u00e2garh, and remained there long after multitudes of their race in other places had been destroyed. But they were finally expelled by the present R\u00e2ja of M\u00e2nd\u00e2, to whom reference has been already made. The Arail and Barrah pargannahs have also Bhars residing in them. They are likewise met with in every village of pargannah Salimp\u00fbr, Majhoh\u00ee in the Gorakhpur District. In Sh\u00e2h\u00e2b\u00e2d they still hold a portion of the extensive domains formerly in the possession of the tribe. A pargannah of Ch\u00f4t\u00e2 N\u00e2gpur is called Bharwa.\n\nIn fact, the Bhars still cling with pertinacity to the country in which their more fortunate ancestors flourished for so many generations. In most of the cities and towns, and in not a few of the villages likewise, scattered members of the tribe are found. They exhibit little tribal cohesiveness or esprit de corps, and are utterly destitute of spirit and enterprise. In the Gh\u00e2zipur District alone there are fifty-six thousand Bhars; in Gorakhpur, sixty-three thousand; in Azimgarh, sixty-nine thousand; in Benares, thirty-three thousand, and many more in other places. Bhars are commonly employed as village policemen, and also as ploughmen. It is said that there are properly two divisions of them, the Bhars and the R\u00e2jbhars, the latter differing from the former in not eating swines' flesh, and being regarded, consequently, as more honourable than the latter. It is not improbable that they may be descended from the old Bhar nobility. R\u00e2jpoots are in the habit of purchasing female children from the R\u00e2jbhars and marrying them to their sons; this arises from the habit of infanticide which has existed for so long among some of the R\u00e2jpoot tribes.\n\nIn spite of the pertinacity with which, if tradition is correct, the higher castes kept aloof from Bhar alliances, they\nwere not always successful in doing so. In the Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d District, for instance, three examples are found of unions with Bhar families. Mr. G. Ricketts in his memorandum states that three influential castes or clans claim an admixture of Bhar blood. These are the Bharors, Garhors, and Tikaits. The two former are not numerous; they are landed proprietors in the southern portion of this district, and appear to be a connecting link between the higher castes, who are generally landed proprietors, and those inferior castes, whose lot is servitude. The Tikaits are numerous and possess much influence. A Chauh\u00e2n leader carried off his Bhar chief\u2019s daughter. The descendants are still proprietors of a portion of that Bhar chief\u2019s possessions.\\(^1\\)\n\nMr. P. Carnegy, in his \u201cNotes on the Races of Oudh,\u201d indulges the strange notion that the Bhars are of R\u00e2jpoot origin, and the Cher\u00fbs also, \u201cand such like.\u201d And yet he acknowledges that the \u201cweight of opinion seems to be in favour of the belief that the Bhars may have been the so-called aborigines of Eastern Oudh, which formerly included Azimg\u00e2r\u00ee and Gorakhpur.\u201d This view he dissents from, holding that if they were \u201cnot the aborigines of Eastern Oudh, they were at any rate R\u00e2jpoots in R\u00e2ma\u2019s time, or long before the Christian era.\u201d\n\nIt is a question of considerable ethnological interest whether the Bhars were originally connected with the Cher\u00fbs, Seor\u00fbs, and other ancient races of Northern India. The Cher\u00fbs are sometimes spoken of as a branch of the Bhars; and as to the Seor\u00fbs, it was the opinion of Sir H. Elliot that there was great reason to suppose that Cher\u00fbs and Seor\u00fbs were formerly one and the same; yet he says it is very difficult to trace the connexion between these tribes. It is certainly remarkable that the pargannah of Barhar, in the Mirz\u00e2pur District\u2014which I have no doubt should be Bharhar; the second syllable, \u201char,\u201d being the reduplication of the \u201char\u201d of the first syllable\u2014is at the present time partly inhabited by a race of Seor\u00fbs.\n\nMy own belief is, that many of the aboriginal tribes of\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Ricketts\u2019 Report, p. 128.\nIndia were originally blended together. All investigation into the races of India goes to prove that at various epochs separate tribes have spread over the land, one pushing forward another, the weaker and less civilized retreating to the jungles and hilly fastnesses; and the stronger, in their turn, giving place to fresh and more vigorous clans. It may be impossible to prove, therefore, what is nevertheless highly probable, that in very ancient times most of these tribes were exceedingly few in number; for it is a singular circumstance, opposed, indeed, when regarded superficially, to the assumption I am making, that the races of India, whether Aryan or non-Aryan, for a long succession of ages, have largely maintained their distinctive individuality, notwithstanding the fluctuations in their respective histories. Still, to some extent, they have united with one another, and it is indisputable that a large number of the low castes of India have sprung from unions between the races. In many instances a careful scrutiny can detect in these castes, not only their special differences, but also the very names by which the clans they represent were primarily designated.\n\nThis scattering of tribes over the country has produced a result which perhaps is not found on the same scale in any other part of the world, namely, that every district in India has its peculiar clans, with their own traditions and annals; and has, in addition, a host of fragmentary and isolated remnants of lost or vanquished tribes, like the Bhars, of which, in some cases, scarcely more than their bare names can now be traced.\n\nBut the subject of the history of the aboriginal races of India is one which, although material is being gradually collected for its elucidation, is nevertheless so intricate and involved that it will require long and patient research before satisfactory conclusions are attained. The unravelling of the tangled skein of Indian history is necessarily a work of time, and of great difficulty. Yet something has been already accomplished by earnest, conscientious, and painstaking labourers. Exceedingly harassing as the task undoubtedly is, still knot after knot of the disordered thread is being gradually\nunloosed. The enterprise is one demanding perseverance and industry, which will achieve in this, as in most pursuits, far greater and more brilliant results than the sudden efforts of an intense and fitful enthusiasm.\n\nIn addition to my own independent investigations on the subject of this essay, I have received considerable assistance in its preparation from the following works:\u2014Mr. Plowden\u2019s General Report of the Census of the North-West Provinces, for 1865; Mr. G.

Baillie.\n\nThe term Jihad is technically applied to warfare carried on for the propagation of the Mohammedan religion. As such warfare is unlawful, unless the people against whom it is about to be waged have been first summoned to embrace the faith, this summons has entered into the legal definition of the term. Jihad is accordingly defined to be a call to the true religion, and war with those who refuse to accept it in their persons or property,\u2014that is, by professing the faith themselves, or by submitting to pay the jizyut or poll-tax, by means of which they are rendered free to the open profession of their own religion.\n\nTwo conditions are required to the permission or legality of Jihad. One of these is the refusal of the enemy, when called upon, to submit to the proffered terms, together with the absence of any agreement or treaty between them and the Mussulmans; and the other is good ground for hope on the part of the latter that they will be able to contend successfully against the enemy, should the terms be rejected.\\(^1\\) Subject to these conditions, aggressive warfare against infidels is lawful according to the Soonnees.\\(^2\\) But the Sheeahs add a further condition, namely, the presence of the Imam, or of some one appointed by him to conduct the Jihad;\\(^3\\) and as that cannot be had while he remains concealed from the eyes of the faithful, Jihad, according to the Sheeahs, is, under present circumstances, positively forbidden. It is, I think, commonly assumed by Sooonnee writers, at least by those of the Hanifite or prevailing sect in India, that Jihads are directed and organized by the Imam or head of the whole Mussulman community. But as in these times there is no\n\n\\(^1\\) Fatawa Alum-geeree, vol. ii., p. 266. \\(^2\\) Hamilton's Hedaya, vol. ii., p. 141. \\(^3\\) Shuraya-ool-Islam, p. 136.\ngenerally acknowledged head of the whole community, it is held that the duty of Jihad, which is in a manner incumbent on all true believers, is sufficiently satisfied if any one kowm or tribe of Mussulmans is engaged in it. It follows, therefore, that Jihad may be proclaimed and organized by the Imam or head of any tribe or nation of Mussulmans who is able to conduct it with a reasonable hope of success; without which, indeed, Jihad is positively unlawful, as a useless imperilling of the lives and property of the faithful.\\(^1\\)\n\nWhen the Imam has determined on a Jihad, he should review and number his army, to ascertain its strength in horse and foot, and enter the names of his soldiers in a general muster-roll. He is then, upon entering the enemy's country, to call upon the people in the terms before mentioned, and if they should reject both alternatives, and are conquered, their persons and property are at his absolute disposal. It is important to observe that if there should be any among the conquered people who have embraced the faith, though themselves and their infant children are free, and they are allowed to retain possession of their movable property, yet all of it that is immovable becomes, like the rest of the conquered territory, fei, or confiscated for the benefit of the conquerors.\\(^2\\)\n\nFrom what has been said it is obvious that Jihad is public warfare, and as it is permitted only under conditions which a State alone is capable of satisfying, it is evident that it is only in such circumstances that it can ever be the duty of individual Mussulmans to join in it. Even then it is only a general duty, and does not become special, so as by its neglect to bring guilt on individuals, so long as it is engaged in by any one tribe or people of Mussulmans. The only case in which, from being a general duty, it becomes special, is that of a nufer or alarm that the enemy are coming to attack a country, and the persons, families, and property of its inhabitants. It then becomes the duty of all who are able to go out to the Jihad. But even in such circumstances, it is not the duty of the whole Mussulman community to come to\n\n\\(^1\\) Fut. Alum., vol. ii., p. 266.\n\n\\(^2\\) Hedaya, vol. ii., p. 170.\ntheir aid. Only those who are near the enemy, and able to contend with them, are bound to join in the contest. With regard to all the rest, the duty remains as before, *furz-i-kifayut*, that is, one which is sufficiently fulfilled, if observed by any tribe belonging to the community.\n\nThese are the only two cases that I have met with in the books in which *Jihad* is permitted or lawful, and they afford no sanction to the idea that Mussulmans living under a foreign government are allowed to rise up against it unprovoked; while it is to be observed that permission is absolutely necessary to the legality of *Jihad*, for the destruction of human life is in itself a positive evil.\\(^1\\) Much less can such a rising be considered a duty under such circumstances. Indeed, to suppose that it can be so is little short of a libel against the Mohammedan Law and Religion.\n\nI have hitherto assumed that there is no treaty or agreement between the people against whom the *Jihad* is carried on and the general body of Mussulmans. Though Mohammedans have long ceased to be under the sway of one sovereign, they are so bound together by the common tie of Isl\u00e1m, that as between themselves there is no difference of country, and they are therefore said to compose one *dar* or mansion; and in like manner, all who are not Mohammedans, being accounted by them as of one faith, however much they may differ from each other in religious belief, are also said to be of one *dar*. The whole world, therefore, or so much of it as is inhabited and under regular government, has been divided into the *Dar-ool-Islam*, which comprehends Arabia and all other countries subject to Mussulman rule, and the *Dar-ool-Hurb*, which comprehends all countries that are not subject to such rule.\n\nThough *hurb* means literally enmity, and all foreigners are *hurbees* or enemies in the eye of the law, yet Mohammedan governments have found it necessary, from the earliest times, to enter into treaties of peace with foreigners. It is true that the Imam may, if he deem it to be for the advantage of the Mussulmans, withdraw from such treaties by giving due\n\n\\(^1\\) Bedaya, vol. ii., p. 140.\nnotice of his intention; but while the treaties remain in force they are strictly to be observed, and are binding on the whole community. The notice of withdrawal must be such as to enable the king or ruler of the people with whom the treaty was made, to give his subjects timely warning throughout his dominions, and thus put them on their guard against a renewal of hostilities. Without such notice the renewal would be *ghudr* or perfidy, for which the Prophet has indicated his special abhorrence in terms that will be noticed more particularly hereafter.\n\nThe exigencies of commerce have also rendered it necessary to sanction the residence of foreigners in Mohammedan countries, when similar privileges are allowed to Mohammedans in these countries. In such circumstances, when a Mohammedan is allowed to reside in a foreign country, he is strictly prohibited by his own law from molesting in any way, either in their persons or property, the people among whom he is permitted to dwell. The reason or principle of the prohibition is this, that by *isteeman* or obtaining protection, he has become in a manner a *zamin*, or surety to the people for his peaceable conduct towards them, and any molestation by him of them, under such circumstances, would be a breach of suretyship, and an act of *ghudr* or perfidy.\\(^1\\) The principle is therefore quite general,\u2014suretyship being the co-relative of protection,\u2014and it is equally applicable to all persons, whether merchants or not, and whatever be their numbers, who have obtained, or are in the enjoyment of, the protection. Being the co-relative of protection, it is binding only so long as that is afforded. If, therefore, the sovereign of the country should break his engagement by seizing the property of a Mussulman resident, or throwing him into prison, or others should do so with the sovereign\u2019s knowledge and without his preventing them, the person subjected to such treatment would be freed from his counter-obligation, and might lawfully retaliate by molesting the people of the country in their persons or property. But until this takes place, the resident under protection, or *moostamin* as he is\n\n\\(^1\\) *Hidayah* (original), vol. ii., p. 715.\ntermed, is bound to refrain, and any breach of his obligation of suretyship is, as already observed, *ghudr* or perfidy.\n\nNow Mohammed has marked his special abhorrence of this offence by declaring that the *ghadir* or perfidious person shall be set up on a stake, that is impaled, at the day of final retribution, in order that his perfidy may be publicly made known to the assembled universe.\\(^1\\)\n\nSo much for the general law of *Jihad*. Let us now see how far it is applicable to the relation in which the British Government stands to Mohammedan countries, and the Mussulman subjects of our Indian Empire stand towards the Government of that country.\n\nWith regard to the first point, there are subsisting treaties of amity between the British Government, on the one hand, and the Turkish Empire and the kingdoms of Persia and Afghanistan on the other. These treaties are binding on the whole Mussulman community; in so much that while they subsist, *Jihad*, or warfare for the purpose of propagating the Mussulman faith among the subjects of the British Government, is prohibited to all Mohammedan States. If, therefore, the *Sittanah* camp, which is said to be formed on our north-west frontier, for the purpose of invading our territories, is to be considered as a Mohammedan State, having a duly constituted Imam at its head (and it is only on such a supposition that *Jihad* by it would be lawful), then the people assembled in it are bound by the said treaties, and are actually prohibited by their own law from making any assault of a religious character upon us. It cannot therefore be lawful for other Mussulmans to assist them in any attempt of the kind, and much less so for our Indian Mussulmans, who are under a further restraint by the protection afforded them by the Government of that country.\n\nThat they enjoy the fullest protection under the British Government cannot be denied. Nor has it ever been alleged that they are exposed to any kind of molestation in their persons or property by the Government, or by any other persons with its knowledge or connivance. They are thus\n\n\\(^1\\) Kifayah, vol. ii., p. 762.\nclearly under the obligation imposed upon them by their *isteeman* or enjoyment of protection. Any act of hostility in their own persons, or by money or other assistance given to enemies, would therefore be an act of *ghudr* or perfidy on their part, and thus expose them to the doom denounced against the *ghadir* by their own Prophet.\n\nBefore concluding these remarks, I will briefly advert to a question that has been lately revived amongst Mussulmans in India, viz., whether so much of that country as is subject to British rule has become *Dar-ool-Hurb*, or is still *Dar-ool-Islam*. *Prima facie*, every country under any other than Mussulman government is to be accounted *Dar-ool-Hurb*. But, according to Aboo Huneefa, a country which, like British India, was once *Dar-ool-Islam*, does not change its character merely by passing under the government of infidels. Other conditions are required, which can hardly be said to be fully satisfied in the case of British India. According to his two disciples and companions, Aboo Yoosuf and Mohammed, these conditions are not required, simple conquest being all that they deem necessary. Analogy is in favour of their opinion, but the results to which their doctrine would lead are rather in favour of that of their master. By conquest the whole property, public and private, of the conquered people, passes *ipso facto* to their conquerors; and this holds good of conquests by infidels over Mohammedans, provided that the property is secured within the infidel territory. Now this condition is satisfied at once if the country in which the property is situated becomes *Dar-ool-Hurb*, and the Mussulman owners thus lose all right to reclaim their property, if it has been divided, as it legally may be, among the soldiery. Be that as it may, there is, however, no doubt that when the two disciples concur in opinion against their master, a judge is at liberty, according to the general rule, to adopt whichever of the opinions he thinks best. A Mohammedan leader disposed to attack British India is therefore not unlikely to treat it as *Dar-ool-Hurb*. Let us assume, then, that British India is *Dar-ool-Hurb*, and, further, let us suppose that the threatened *Sittanah* invasion has been made and is successful,\nwhat are likely to be the consequences of such an event to Mussulmans in British India? The Sittanahs are Wahabees, that is, Soonnees of the straitest sect of the law, who wish to restore all things to their pristine vigour. According to the Mohammedan law the conquered country, with all the property, public or private, of its inhabitants, would immediately pass by the mere fact of conquest to the conquerors. There would be an exception to this in favour of the Mussulmans, so far as regards their movable property, but none as to their lands. These, as already mentioned, would, like the rest of the land in the country, become fei, or be confiscated for the general purposes of the State. In particular, all permanent settlements of the revenue would be swept away; and last, but not least, all La Khiraj tenures, which, if extended beyond the life of the grantee, are utterly void at Mohammedan law, might be at once cancelled. Further, the Mussulmans in particular, might be subjected to a rigid exaction of the zukat or poor's-rate from all persons possessed of property to the value of 200 dirhems (about ten pounds); which would be more than any income-tax that is ever likely to be imposed upon them by their Christian rulers. So that, on the whole, it might be better for our Indian Mussulmans, in a worldly point of view, as well as more conformable to the precepts of their Prophet, to remain contented with their present condition under the British Government, than to take their chance of what might befall them under conquerors of their own religion.\nART.

Illustrated by Coins. By E. Thomas, F.R.S.\n\nThe plates which accompany this article have only recently been rescued from an obscure corner, where they had lain for years unappreciated. They originally constituted one division of a comprehensive medallic series, illustrative of the annals of the Sassanian Kings of Persia, which were prepared under the supervision of the late J. R. Steuart, from specimens in his own cabinets, and executed by the same conscientious Italian artist who engraved the copper-plates of the Saur\u00e1shtran coins inserted in one of the earliest numbers of our Journal (vol. iv. p. 273, o.s.).\n\nThe two engravings, which now appear for the first time, embrace the concluding section of the series of ten 4to. plates devoted to the coins of \"the Sassanian dynasty,\" and represent the specially transitional period immediately succeeding the Arab conquest. They furnish choice and consecutive examples of the introductory Muslim mintages, ranging from the crude imitative reproductions of Sassanian money by the first Muhammadans in Persia, and mark, in their gradations, the progressive stages of the Pehlvi mintages of the more settled rulers, up to the final adoption of the Kufic of the Kur\u00e1n as the official alphabet of the expanded dominions of the Khalifs.\n\nThe majority of these pieces have already been described in our pages (vols. xii. p. 253, xiii. p. 373); but as I hesitated to burden the Society with such costly and elaborate designs, these engravings may, even at this distant date, fitly contribute to the elucidation of the general subject, and serve to\n\n1 These plates are now the property of that enterprising collector of Oriental antiquities, Col.

I propose to restrict the present notice of the coins to little more than a mere recital and explanation of their legends, with occasional references to the general progress of the study of the Pehlvi language that has marked the interval since the publication of my later papers on these subjects.

Justi. The tone of this article would alone prevent my conceding it any serious notice; but it is clear that no object could be attained by my entering upon a discussion with the author, or those who accept his interpretations upon texts the very alphabet of which is still in dispute. So that, although M. Justi's eccentric lucubration has received the commendation of M. Renan (Rapport, Journal Asiatic), I am content to surrender the writer to the more congenial conflict with his countryman, Dr. Haug, who has already sounded the note of defiance, about the \"grave errors\" of my \"vicious\" critic, whom he contemptuously designates as \"a mere follower of Spiegel.\" (Pahlavi-Zand Glossary, pp. 25, 32.)\n\n\\(^3\\) Dr. Haug is scarcely candid in affirming that \"the phonetic value of the character \\( \\sigma \\) has been thought to be \\( i \\), chiefly on account of its resemblance in form to the Zend letter \\( j \\)\" (An Old Pahlavi-Pazand Glossary, 1870, p. 44). There is far more varied testimony towards the identification than this abrupt utterance would imply, as I have, in effect, repeated above. My first acceptance of the letter as \\( i \\) dates from 1852 (Journal Royal Asiatic Society, xiii. p. 375); and I find Dr. Haug confessing in 1862 (Essays on the Sacred Language of the Parsees, Bombay, p. 45) that \\( \\sigma \\) Barj is the Chaldee bar, \"son,\" (ben in Hebrew and Arabic); the \\( j \\) at the end is another pronunciation of the relative \\( i \\) (or izafat) above mentioned [in \\( \\sigma \\) Bagi]. It is curious that the Professor should at this period have so accurately realized and defined the mission of the letter and its direct association with the short \\( i \\), and yet have failed to detect its positive import. It was reserved, however, for his later baptism in the fire-worship of the Gujarati Dest\u00e0rs to convert him from his hard-earned European knowledge to their atmosphere of placid ignorance, and the restoration of the contested symbol\nI have held from the first that the idea of combining consonants, for the purpose of eliding the inherent short \\(a\\) of the conventional Aryan speech, was altogether undeveloped in the Semitic alphabet of the Sassanians, though the system had already been elaborated in the more critical Bactrian adaptation of the old Ph\u0153nician characters in its parallel contact with the contrasted L\u0101t or P\u0101li character of the Indian provinces. This tendency is readily exemplified in the practical transcription of Greek names on the local coinage, where we find the Bactrian \"Eukratides\" and the Indian P\u0101li \"Agathokles\" coalescing the consonant succeeding to the \\(k\\), in either case to denote emphatically the absence of the soft \\(a\\). Here the object of compounding and connecting letters is obvious enough; but the most singular fact which the advocates of the rendering of the Sassanian \\(m n\\) are altogether unable to explain is, if, as they confess, the two simple letters \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) were written separately in the parallel text, with an optional value of man or min, why, or for what possible object, an arbitrary compound should have been introduced to convey the self-same sounds, a resulting alphabetical combination, moreover, which, according to their own showing, did not necessarily elide the short vowel. If this particular sign \\(m n\\) had been a composite character for \\(m n\\), matured during the progressive manipulation of the normal alphabet, it ought to show some traces of the parent letters, whereas the simple \\(m n\\), in its various gradations, flows easily\n\nto Anquetil du Perron's faulty version of man, contributed of old by the less degraded representatives of the Parsi faith in 1759.\n\nMr. E. W. West, C.E., whose good service to the cause of Indian pal\u00e6ography in his facsimiles and decipherments of the inscriptions on the walls of the Western Cave Temples, I can freely bear testimony to, has lately undertaken the study of Pehlvi, in concert with Dr. Haug, of Munich, and has argued the question of the value of the character under discussion with much patience and ingenuity in opposition to my interpretation. I am unable to discover that he has at all shaken my position, and I regret to find that he ignores, or unduly subordinates, the very important evidence in favour of the \\(i\\), to be drawn from the previous identities of the Ph\u0153nician and other derivative forms of \\(m n\\). (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1870, p. 364.)\n\n1 A large assortment of these compounds is given in my plate of the Bactrian alphabet (Num. Chron. iii. n.s. plate vi.), and the particular instances above cited may be consulted in Gen. Cunningham's plate v. vol. viii. of the same journal; and the facsimiles illustrating Professor Dowson's article on Bactrian Inscriptions, J.R.A.S. xx. o.s. p. 221.

In addition to this difficulty\nabout the m n, Mr. West has introduced a new element of\ndiscord in summarily attempting to convert the very palpable\n\u03b7=\u03bd of the Chald\u00e6o-Pehlvi into a \u03c1; and, finally, Dr. Haug\ndesires to elevate a badly defined \u03c1=k in the Sassanian text\nof the inscription into a new and extraneous letter, represent-\ning the sound of \"kat.\" It may be said that this does not\npresent a very long list of variants, after all; but the deter-\nmination of the value of the most important of these cha-\nracters as m n, or i, constitutes a positively vital question, as\nits decision in a measure carries with it the determination of\nthe structure of the language itself.\n\nUp to this time the Inscription Pal\u00e6ography maintains its\narchaic features in the absolute isolation of letter from letter.\nThe tendency to continuous MS. writing, due to the con-\nsecutive flow of the pen upon a smooth surface, has already\nbeen adverted to (J.R.A.S. iii. n.s. p. 252). Its effect was\nspeedily to reduce the Sassanian Pehlvi into the irrepress-\nible conjunction of consonants and general reticulation of\nletters, which has added an adventitious obstacle to the free\ndecipherment of the ancient writings in their modern garb.\nThis tendency may be traced, in its progressive action, in the\naccompanying plates, and in its more ample development in\nthe limited table of compounds prefixed to the description of\nthe coins, in my previous article (vol. xii. p. 274). But the\nlater P\u00e1rs\u00ed complications may be exemplified by the demand\nof Dr. Haug upon his European printers for several hundred\ndifferent forms to secure sufficient ambiguity for his client's\ninterpretations.\n\nHad the Bombay P\u00e1rs\u00eds really understood the language they\npretended to interpret, they might have printed every text\nin their possession, and at the same time have secured far\ngreater legibility, with the detached letters of their limited alphabet, instead of complicating the decipherment by the use of imitative MS. interlaced forms, for the partial definition of which no less than sixteen pages of modern type were required.\\(^1\\)\n\nFinally, to reduce me to definite extinction, under the Pehlvi aspect, MM. Haug and West have put forth a trial piece, or competitive essay, in the form of a new and improved version of the bilingual inscriptions of Sapor engraved on the smoothed inner surface of the cavern at H\u00e1ji\u00e1b\u00e1d. My own tentative reading of this confessedly obscure text,\u2014a text, be it remembered, that had set European linguists at defiance for half a century;\\(^2\\)\u2014was given with sufficient reserve,\\(^3\\) a feeling which does not seem to be shared by later interpreters. All I can say is, that if this translation, revised by Dr. Haug in 1870, after a preliminary ventilation by Mr. West in our pages in 1869, really and truly represents the purport of the original inscription, the \u201cdivine\u201d King Sapor must have arrived at a very advanced stage of dotage before he could have consented to put his hand to such a document.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Old Pahlavi-Pazand Glossary devotes sixteen pages (25\u201341) to \u201cthe various phonetic powers of the letters and their compounds occurring in the glossaries,\u201d etc., and its Editors confess that the list of needless obscurations is far from exhausted.\n\n\\(^2\\) In 1858, I said in my edition of \u201cPrinsep\u2019s Essays,\u201d ii. p. 108, \u201cOf all those who are learned in Zend and its cognate languages\u2014of the various professors who edit Pehlvi texts, or who put together grammars of that tongue\u2014no single individual has to this day been able to add one line of translation to the bilingual inscriptions of H\u00e1ji\u00e1b\u00e1d, beyond what De Sacy had already taught us in 1793. In brief, our power of interpretation fails us exactly where the Sassanians have omitted to supply us with the Greek translations they appended to some of the parallel texts.\u201d\n\n\\(^3\\) J.R.A.S. iii. v.s. p. 339.\n\n\\(^4\\) Lest my readers should suppose that I am exaggerating in this matter, I append M. Haug\u2019s revised version in his own original words:\u2014After titles, etc., \u201cthe king. As we shot this arrow, then we shot it in the presence of the satraps, the grandees, peers and noblemen; we put the foot in this cave; we threw the arrow outside that it should reach the target; the arrow (was) flying beyond that (target); whither the arrow had been thrown, there was no place (to hit), where if a target had been constructed, then it (the arrow) would have been manifest (?). Afterwards it was ordered by us: an invisible target is constructed for the future (?); an invisible hand has written, \u2018do not put the foot in this cave, and do not shoot an arrow at this target after an invisible arrow has been thrown at this target;\u2019 such wrote the hand.\u201d\u2014Hang, Pahlavi General Glossary, p. 64. This reads like a very chaotic version of the ancient fable of Minuchehar, whose arrow from the peak of Damavand was to settle new boundaries, but whose progress through the air the incredulous reduced from the pretended Divine\nOne of the most curious points in this controversy is that Dr. Haug, whose accepted local oracle denounces in unmeasured terms\\(^1\\) the ignorance of his fellow P\u00e1rs\u00eds of Bombay\u2014proposes, like myself, to rectify their orthographical errors by an appeal to the unpolluted sources of \"Sassanian Inscriptions.\"\\(^2\\) It is clear that, under these conditions, the typical alphabetical scheme ought to be subjected to the most rigorous and thoroughly independent criticism; otherwise, if it be allowed in any way to lend itself to the needs of preconceived P\u00e1rs\u00ed interpretations, it not only fails in its appointed mission, but perpetuates the very faults it is invoked to correct.\n\nI have shown (p. 411, note 3) that Dr. Haug was very nearly fathoming the real import of the ancient character \\(a\\); but what shall we say of his elected antagonist,\\(^3\\) M.

This ignorance has prevailed to such an extent that though the priests learn this glossary, parrot-like, off by heart, yet they cannot critically make out the exact meanings of many words, but are satisfied with mere guesses, etc.\u2014Dest\u00far Hoshang Jamasp, in his Old Pahlavi-P\u00e1zand Glossary, p. ix.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ibid. p. vii.\n\n\\(^3\\) There has been a good deal of needless acerbity introduced into these discussions, and Dr. Haug seems to exist only in a permanent state of warfare with the rest of his countrymen. Spiegel, however, is more distinctly singled out for condemnation in such amiabilities as the following: \"As regards his views of the character of the language, and his explanations of the non-Iranian element, linguists are not likely to feel satisfied.\" \"The title of (a later) work, 'The Traditional Literature of the Parsis,' in its connexion with the conterminous literature, is therefore more pretentious than appropriate,\" etc. etc. (An Old Pahlavi-Pazand Glossary, pp. 16, 20.)\nknow how to provide for in his vague alphabetical reconstructions.\n\nIn his first publication, the P\u00e1rs\u00ed Grammar (1851), M. Spiegel expressly declared that the identical character was the Y\u00e1'i m'ar\u00faf, or known y\u00e1, as opposed to the Y\u00e1'i majh\u00fal, or unknown y\u00e1, represented by the Zend \u03b5. In his subsequent work on the \"Huzv\u00e1resch-sprache\" (1856), he servilely adheres to Anquetil's Boman \u0628\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0646 for \u0628\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0646 (pp. 169, 172); but simultaneously enters in his Pehlvi alphabets the letter above referred to outlined as , to which he assigns the value of \u00ea (pp. 27, 48, 53). This letter, as I have attempted to prove in my previous article, is, however, nothing more than i final, or the iz\u00e1fat which plays so important a part in old and new Persian vernaculars, and which may be traced in the accompanying plates from the final \u03b5 in Khusrui, figs. 1, 2, to the positive conjunctive but instructively isolated iz\u00e1fat in figs. 3, 4, etc. I must, however, do M. Spiegel the justice to say that he has discarded the obnoxious Boman from his latest Pehlvi vocabularies.\n\nThe Editors of the Old Pahlavi-Pazand Glossary, though they do not admit the letter to a place in their table of alphabets, are constrained to recognize its true import amid the list of compound characters, where is acknowledged to represent the sounds of \"ai, hi, or kh\u00ee.\" Why then, by parity of reasoning, should not be equal to the ii, or, in\n\n---\n\n1 Grammatik der P\u00e1rsisprache (Leipzig, 1851), p. 22.\n\n(a) i. oder \u064a\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647 ist der Zend vocal 10, z.

I, on the other hand, aim at the more comprehensive criticism afforded by the dialects of immediately proximate lands, and the inductive teaching of the earlier alphabets, preserved on medals, seals, and other antiquarian remains, which come down to the confessed starting-point of the attempted neo-Persian reconstruction of the ancient rituals, under Ardashir B\u0101bak and his immediate successors. The representatives of the archaic creed to whom this duty was entrusted are most candid in their admissions of the difficulties they had to encounter consequent upon the pretended destruction of the scriptures of the old Fire-Worshippers by Alexander the Great,\u00b2 and the unavowed but more important influence of 537 years of discouragement and obscuration of the religion itself, which succeeded, under the Seleucid\u00e6 and Arsacid\u00e6, up to the date of the attempted revival of their ancestral faith.\n\nNor did the ancient tongue itself fare better than the lost books which embodied the primitive rites.

The real destroyers of the primitive lore were the Muslims, who nevertheless reverenced, and for a time preserved, and finally translated all that was worth having in the accessible Pehlvi MSS. It would rather seem that the new Zoroastrianism ought to take its date from the latter period of depression; for there clearly were plenty of Pehlvi MSS. still extant in A.H. 318 = A.D. 930.\u2014See Reinaud, Abulfeda, p. lxv. note 2.\ncular utterance, current among all classes of the nation, the limited seventeen letters of the coeval alphabet fully sufficed to convey any required sense to the comprehensions of those who thought and spoke in the common language. We have a nearly parallel illustration of this faculty of using short-hand notation in the colloquial Hindi of the present day, which resolutely refuses to avail itself of the intricacies of the more elaborated Sanskrit characters, and adheres consistently to the simple detached consonants of antiquity, with all the associate uncertainty of intonation. But the typical Persian language clearly became degraded on its own soil, under the action of successive waves of conquest, irregular hostile occupation and the introduction of foreign speech into the official documents of court and camp, as alien rulers chanced to dominate. Such influences, apart from the general depression of the religious communities, who alone had an interest in the preservation of the sacred texts, must have rendered any satisfactory reconstruction of the earlier rituals a task far beyond the powers of the degenerate Mobeds of the scattered Fire-temples, even if the old letters of the alphabet had not been then, as now, altogether insufficient to define obsolete grammatical inflexions, and still less competent to restore the purport of a lost tongue.\n\nThe language of the inscriptions, under these conditions, may be held to have primarily followed the mixed speech of the head-quarters, which consisted of a sort of Eastern Lingua Franca or Mesopotamian Urdu, abounding in Aramaisms, and in the selected epigraphs under review, freely interspersed with independent religious texts, which were by no means necessarily Zoroastrian.\n\nThe language of the books, on the other hand, if they truly reproduced the ancient texts, should have presented a modified form either of primitive Pehlvi, archaic Zend, or, at the lowest, a dialect but little removed from the Persian Cuneiform. But, to judge by its composite character, it would seem as if the dry bones and disjecta membra of the old Iranian rituals had been galvanized into a specious vitality by the introduction of Semitic verbs with Persian terminations, added to which the practice of writing one word and\npronouncing another savours strongly of priestcraft, whose revision in this case was neither competent nor honest. If to construct grammars and dictionaries out of such materials be a labour of high ingenuity, I can concede that much credit to our modern authorities; but I must be excused if I remain incredulous as to the value on finality of the results thus obtained.\n\nIf I have had to suggest anything derogatory to the attainments of the modern P\u00e1rs\u00ed teachers in the Western Presidency, I am glad to have the opportunity of quoting, with renewed hope, our own Royal Asiatic Society's motto, \"Ex Oriente lux,\" as, by a singular chance, I have this day (11th Jan., 1872) received from Bombay a comprehensive series of the publications of the later earnest revivers of the old lore, in their adopted home under the British flag\u2014in the shape of even more difficult reading than the Pehlvi itself, as explained and illustrated by Guzr\u00e1ti commentaries; but I recognize with satisfaction the conscientious endeavours of the present representatives of the archaic faith in Bombay to encounter, and I trust overcome, many of the difficulties inherent in their ethnic language\u2014in this I am the more encouraged by the tone of mixed frankness and confidence disclosed in Dest\u00far Behr\u00e1nj\u00ed Sunjana's preface to his new Pehlvi Grammar,\u00b9 which augurs well for the future, in a seeming aspiration of the local P\u00e1rs\u00eds to free themselves from European dogmatism, and to rehabilitate their national speech by their intuitive hereditary perceptions, from independent\n\n\u00b9 A Grammar of the Pahlavi Language, by Peshotun Dustoor Behramjee Sunjana.

The modern Orientalists of Europe, however, have modified such pronunciations, but such modifications I do not feel justified in recommending to my Zoroastrian brethren.\" Of course, I am not likely to endorse all our new grammarian's notions, many of which are clearly crude, and require for their correction that foreign travel and outside ventilation which I have advised above; but not the less may I welcome an effort at free thought, and a seeking after the truth, which I admire above all things. One word of warning, too, I must add to those who may be disposed to over-estimate the advantages of Iranian descent, in the revival and reconstruction of their ancient tongue, as they must bear in mind that for generations past they have been domiciled and educated in a foreign land, and learnt from their cradles to frame their ideas in an alien idiom; so that their ancestral language, or even its modern representative, has to be acquired anew.\nsources and the extant documents of their creed. I am sanguine that these records may be largely augmented when the less passive members of the community undertake to scrutinize their own Indian depositaries, or boldly seek to penetrate into other closed receptacles of the obscure literature of the past,\u2014in lands to which they have preferential access.\n\nIn concluding this branch of a single alphabetical controversy, I may be permitted to reproduce a more comprehensive view of the general question, which I submitted viv\u00e2 voce, but with scant preparation, to the Meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 9th April, 1866.\n\nAs this merely suggestive outline has never been formally incorporated in our Transactions, I make no apology for quoting in full the semi-official report of the proceedings of the meeting of that date from the Athen\u00e6um newspaper.\n\nThe Right. Hon. Viscount Strangford in the chair.\u2014Mr. Thomas, adverting to recent controversies respecting the parentage of the various modes of writing in use in ancient India, spoke \u201cOn the Adapted Alphabets of the Aryan Races.\u201d These were the results of his pal\u00e6ographical investigations: The Aryans invented no alphabet of their own for their special form of human speech, but were, in all their migrations, indebted to the nationality amid whom they settled for their instruction in the science of writing: (1) The Persian Cuneiform owed its origin to the Assyrian, and the Assyrian Cuneiform emanated from an antecedent Turanian symbolic character; (2) the Greek and Latin alphabets were manifestly derived from the Ph\u0153nician; (3) the Bactrian was adapted to its more precise functions by a reconstruction and amplification of Ph\u0153nician models; (4) the Devanagari was appropriated to the expression of the Sanskrit language from the pre-existing Indian P\u0101li or L\u0101t alphabet, which was obviously originated to meet the requirements of Turanian (Dravidian) dialects; (5) the Pehlvi was the offspring of later and already modified Ph\u0153nician letters; and (6) the Zend was elaborated out of the limited elements of the Pehlvi writing, but by a totally different method to that followed in the adaptation of the Semitic Bactrian. Mr. Thomas then proceeded to advert to the single point open to discussion involved under the 4th head, tracing the progress of the successive waves of Aryan immigration from the Oxus into the provinces of Ariana and the Hindu Kush, and the downward course of the pastoral races from their first entry into the Panj\u0101b and the associate crude chants of the Vedic hymns to the establishment of the cultivated Brahmanic institutions on the banks of the Sarasvati, and the elaboration of Sanskrit grammar at Taxila, connecting the advance of their literature with the simplified but extended alphabet they constructed in the Arianian provinces out of a very archaic type of Ph\u0153nician, and whose graphic efficiency was so singularly aided by the free use of birch bark. This alphabet continued in use as the official writing under the Greek and Indo-Scythian rulers.\nof Northern India, until it was superseded by the superior fitness and capabilities of the local P\u0101li, which is proved by Asoka's scattered inscriptions on rocks and monoliths (L\u0101ts) to have constituted the current writing of the continent of India in B.C. 250, while a similar, if not identical, character is seen to have furnished the prototype of all the varying systems of writing employed by the different nationalities of India at large, from Sind to Ceylon, and spreading over Burmah, till the Indian P\u0101li meets Chinese alphabets on their own soil in Annam. In conclusion, Mr. Thomas pointed out the importance of the discoveries of Norris and Caldwell, derived from completely independent sources, regarding the Scythic origin of the introductory Indian alphabets.\n\nNo substantive article was ever prepared or published in further development of the somewhat comprehensive theory thus enunciated; but its purport has been quoted with seeming approval, and, as far as I am aware, without hostile comment in France and Germany. The subject has likewise been discussed at two several meetings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\u00b9 With the general tenor of these quasi conversational proceedings I have no possible cause of dissatisfaction. Naturally, the living representatives of the Indian Aryans resented any notion of their ancestors having borrowed, even more convenient mechanical vehicles for the expression of thought, from the ignorant Dravidians of the south;\u00b2 but the facts are cumulatively against them, especially\n\n\u00b9 Journal Asiatic Society, Bengal, and Meeting, 6th Feb., 1867, p. 33.\n\u00b2 The subjoined quotation is in so far a virtual reproduction of my letter, inviting the discussion, in situ, of the comparative priority of Indian alphabets, which was read at the Meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, on the 5th February, 1867. I have taken thus much of liberty with the printed report, as to rectify the singular error of the local press, which contrived to arrange my data in the directly opposite sense to the concurrent argument; and as chance would have it, by a casual transposition of the descriptive headings of the alphabets, to obscure completely the whole question, either to Eastern or Western comprehensions. I have, perhaps, been over-confident of the strength of my position, in abstaining, until this moment, from any protest against an editorial blunder, which, in mild terms, left me in a complete minority. But I am quite content to revive this corrected version as a basis for future discussion.\n\n\"I am glad to find that my notice of the derivation of Ariau alphabets attracted attention, and I am most curious to learn the course the discussion took at the Meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal; more especially as I am now following out the Indian section of the inquiry, and have arrived already at some unexpected results, tending to confirm the original Dravidian derivation of the Sanskrit alphabet. The readers of our Journal will not fail to call to mind that Prinsep, in his early comments upon the L\u0101t alphabet, pointed out that, in many instances, the aspirate letters were formed by a duplication of the lines of their corresponding simple letters. The question was not raised as to when these aspirates had been designed, but the inference was, that they had been formed simultaneously with the simple letters, and out of the same elements. I have a different theory to propose, which I submit for the examination and comments of your members: it is to assume that all the simple letters were Dravidian, and constituted a complete and sufficient alphabet for that class of languages, while the aspirates were later additions required for the due expression of M\u0101gadhi and other northern dialects, as the Sanskrit in after-times added its own sibilants to the latter alphabet.\"\nas they have now an opportunity of selecting new adversaries\n\nA glance at the subjoined comparative alphabets will show the twenty consonants (out of the full twenty-one) of the Dravidian system, as opposed to the thirty-one consonants of the Prakrit of Asoka's edicts. Of the additional aspirates of the latter scheme, two only can in any way claim to be ordinary duplications, the chh and th; while a more simple origin might be sought for the latter in a common circle: dh, dh, and ph may fairly be taken as intentional modifications of their corresponding normal letters; but kh and gh, like th and th, have more in common as fellow aspirates than association with their own leading consonants; and, finally, jh and bh seem to have been unfettered adaptations. The s (r\u016b) again differs from the y (j\u016b) only in the reversal of the leading lower limb. As the alphabetical data, upon which alone we have now to rely, are derived from inscriptions embodying a different language, and dating so late as B.C. 250, we can scarcely expect to recover the missing Dravidian consonants; but one, at least, of the vowel tests is significant in the extreme. The Dravidian vowels, as contrasted with the Sanskrit series by Caldwell, arrange themselves as follows:\u2014\n\nSanskrit, a, \u0101, i, \u012b, u, \u016b, r\u012b, ri, l\u012b, li, \u2014, \u0113, ai, \u2014, o, au, n, ah.\n\nTamil, a, \u0101, i, \u012b, u, \u016b, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014, e, \u0113, ei, o, \u014d, \u2014, \u2014, \u2014.\n\n\"The value of the simple e, in the L\u00e1t character, admits of no doubt, the outline of the letter takes the form of D, while the elongated vowel is constructed by a duplication of the sound, effected by the addition of a medial e, thus \"D=ee, apparently the original Dravidian \u0113 (or possibly ei), but which, in Asoka's inscriptions, is made to do duty for ai. In the more distinctly Sanskrit adaptations of the Devan\u0101gar\u012b Bactrian alphabet, the initial a (9) formed the basis of all the other vowels, whose varying values were discriminated by their several vowel marks.\n\n\"I am unwilling to enlarge upon an avowedly speculative suggestion, but I think few will fail to detect the contrast between the archaic crudeness of the simple letters and the more complicated and cursive forms of the aspirates in the L\u00e1t alphabet. Had the latter class of characters uniformly followed the typical design of their corresponding simple letters, there would have been more reason to have assumed a simultaneous and congruous initiation; but the introduction of anomalous signs among the gutturals, the remarkable cursive development assigned to the aspirates, as opposed to the stiff outlines of their simple prototypes (an advance equal in degree, but less obviously marked in the dh and dh), and the inconsistent development of the bh, upon the basis of the old d, all seem to indicate a later and independent elaboration of the aspirates.\n\nThe Normal Dravidian Alphabet.

Ezra, i. 8, 11; v. 14, 16.) The derivation of the term has hitherto been considered uncertain; the dictionaries give one of its variants as \"Ignis cultor\"; but the simple version here seems to be \u0633\u0645\u0627 \"light,\" with the conjunction of \u064a\u0631\u062f\u0646 \"to bear;\" or \u0628\u0622\u0631 \"with fire,\" in the Biblical form. Though the \u0633\u0645\u0627 as a Semitic word might seem out of place in combination with an Aryan termination, I should feel no difficulty in this respect, as the languages were conterminous and interchangeable in many quarters. Sand was latterly so established a titular term that we find \u0633\u0645\u0627 and \u0633\u0645\u0627\u064a on monograms, and Sand ul Millat, \"light of the faith,\" on the coins of the Ghaznavides.\u2014J.R.A.S. ix. 367.

Rawlinson's discoveries in 1866,\u00b9 prominently\n\n\u00b9 \"The belief in a very early empire in Central Asia, coeval with the institution of the Assyrian monarchy, was common among the Greeks long anterior to Alexander's expedition to the East, and could only have been derived from the traditions current at the court of the Achaemenian kings. This belief, again, is connected through the names of Oxyartes and Zoroaster with the Iranian division of the Aryan race, and receives confirmation from the earliest memorials of that people. . . . It is with the Eastern Iranians, however, that we are principally concerned, as the founders of Central Asian civilization. This people, on the authority of the Vendidad, may be supposed to have achieved their first stage of development in Sughd. Their language was probably Zend, as distinguished from the Achaemenian Persian, and somewhat more removed than that dialect from the mother tongue of the Aryans of the south. A more important evidence, however, of the very high state of power and civilization to which they attained is to be found in the information regarding them preserved by the celebrated Abu Rihan Al Biruni, himself a native of the country, and the only Arab writer who investigated the antiquities of the East in a true spirit of historical criticism. This writer supplies us with an extensive specimen of the old dialects of Sughd and Kharism. He gives us in those dialects the names of the twelve months, the names of the thirty days of the month, and the five Epagomenae, together with the names of the signs of the Zodiac and of the seven planets, and lastly of the mansions of the moon. A portion of his nomenclature is original, and offers a most curious subject for investigation; but the majority of the names can be compared, as was to be expected, with the Zend correspondents, and, indeed, are much nearer to the primitive forms than are the better known Parsee equivalents. According to Abu Rihan, again, the solar calendar of Kharism was the most perfect scheme for measuring time with which he was acquainted; and it was maintained by the astronomers of that country that both the solar and lunar Zodiacs had originated with them, the divisions of the signs in their system being far more regular than those adopted by the Greeks or Arabs. . . . Abu Rihan asserts that the Kharismians dated originally from an epoch anterior by 980 years to the era of Seleucide, a date which agrees pretty accurately with the period assigned by our best scholars to the invention of the Jyotisha or Indian calendar.\"\n\n\u2014Quarterly Review, October, 1866, p. 488, etc.\n\nThis last is, perhaps, the most interesting item we gain from Al Biruni's revelations. That there should have existed, in Khariism, a serial system of dating, commencing from 980 years anterior to the official epoch of the Seleucidae (312\u2014311 B.C.) = 1304 B.C., was startling enough; but it is seldom that a given arithmetical problem obtains such definite results as to establish, beyond its own mission, so distinct an identity between scattered and severed branches of one and the same section of the human family; and it is something more than a curious coincidence to associate with this independent method of reckoning the fact that the Oriental world has been wearying itself, for a long time past, to explain whence, how, and why, a fixed sacrificial date, variously calculated by modern astronomers, and possibly, but imperfectly, sustained in the transmitted versions of the old texts, should have developed so close an identity, in its latest and most matured average, with the original numbers of 1304 B.C.; but such would seem to be the result of the independent tests applied to the Jyotisha observation of the Colures, still in use in the Vedic rituals of India under the confession of the later Brahmanical exponents of the ancient creed.\n\nSee also Num.

Dr. Sachau, to whom the Oriental Translation Fund has lately confided the preparation of a critical edition of the leading MSS. upon which Sir H. Rawlinson based his researches, has already made vigorous progress beyond the fettered range of a single work, and will doubtless, in due time, give the world a very comprehensive account of our proper Aryan cradle. Meanwhile, we welcome a contribution from the improved text of the Arab geographer, Al Istakhri, which affirms independently the early traditions of Aryanism of speech in those distant lands, and brings me face to face with an identification, which may chance to prove of considerable importance in the general inquiry: that is, the association of the ancient name of the kingdom of Kh\u00e1rizm itself, with the misinterpreted modern\n\nSanskrit Literature (1859), p. 521; Text of Rig Veda, vol. iv., preface, p. lxxiv.; Journal Royal Asiatic Society, Dr. Wbitney, vol. i. n.s. p. 316; Sir Edward Colebrooke, \"Note on the preceding article,\" p. 332; Strabo, ii. c. i. 15, xi. c. vi. 1, c. vii. 3, c. xi. 5; Pliny, vi. 18, 19; Arrian, iii. c. 29, vii. c. 16; Chronique de Tabari, i. 119; Wilson, Ariana Antiqua, 144; Rawlinson's Herodotus, i. 564; Journal Royal Geographical Society, xix.

Since the above text and associate notes were set up in type, Sir H. Rawlinson has continued the publication of his expositions of the ancient Geography of the Oxus, in a paper contributed to the current number of the Edinburgh Review (Jan., 1872), from which I extract the subjoined notice; but, in explanation of a somewhat dubious expression in the context, I am given to understand that the emplacement of the original \"Oromasidian\" Hapta Hindu on the Upper Oxus, is not in any way to be understood to conflict with the later Vedic designation of the Saptu Sindhu of the Panj\u00e1b.\u2014\"As these identifications are all new and contravene the criticism of the last hundred years, it may be necessary to cite some authority in their support. First, then, for the application of the name of Hapta Hindu, or 'the seven rivers,' to the Upper Oxus, there is the direct authority of Abu Rih\u00e1n.\" See Elliot's Historians, i., p. 49. \"India, or the Panj\u00e1b, had been previously understood by the critics.\" (p. 13.)\n\n2 Dr. Sachau says:\u2014\"The most valuable part of Al \u00e1kk\u00e1r el Bakiya seems to me that which refers to the Central Asiatic Mesopotamia, the country between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and its southern and northern centres of civilization, i.e. Sughdiana and Khiw\u00e1rizm. Bir\u00fani's information on this subject is alike new and important, for these countries were the homestead of Zoroastrianism and the focus of Central Asian civilization, which, shortly before it was trodden down by the Mugbals and Tatars, struck a traveller, like Y\u00e1k\u00fat, with admiration. By the help of Bir\u00fani we shall be able to trace the outlines of the dialects of Sughdiana and Khiw\u00e1rizm, and to bring back the history of those countries.\"\u2014Academy, Nov. 1, 1871.\n\n3 \"Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum,\" M.

If the archaic Oriental names, which I have subdued into a foot-note, confess to an identical derivation and primary purport, we may have to bring the written language, the cognate alphabet embodied on the banks of the Euphrates, into closer relations with the undetermined palaeography of the Eastern nidus.\n\nFor a long time past a vague impression has prevailed that the sister dialect, expressed in the kindred Pehlvi character, might likewise be connected with the geographical limits of the less disturbed settlements of the Aryan Fire-worshippers. A curious confirmation of this supposition has lately been contributed by the publication of the Arabic text of Ibn Khordadbeh, a man in a manner born in the faith, as his name implies, who classes the sanctuaries of Zoroastrianism under the emphatic topographical designation of the \"land of the Pehlvins.\" I reproduce the passage from the excellent French translation of the unique Oxford MS. by M. Barbier de\n\ncuneiform text reproduces the name more closely as Uvarazmia or Uvarazmish.\"\n\n\u2014(Mr. Norris, J.R.A.S. xv. pp. 28, 97, 191.)\n\nMr. Norris and myself have since discussed this question, and I find that he was under the impression that he himself had already conceived such a solution. However, as we have both sought for any published declaration to that effect, we are quite content to concur in the probable coincidence now put forth.\n\n1 Dest\u00fbr Hoshangj\u00ee Jamaspji, in his Oimy\u00e2k, Bombay, 1867, preface, p. iii., asserts, that \"Huzvirdesh means nothing, and can neither be explained from the Persian nor from a Semitic language.\" The latest Parsi attempt at the explanation of the term is that of Dest\u00fbr Sanjana, who transforms it into Huzvekhald\u00eaa, i.e. the Chaldee language.\u2014(Dr. Haug, in Tr\u00fcbner's Record, Nov.30, 1871, p. 75.)\n\n2 \"It is to be written in the writing of the Avesta, or in that of Sevat (Chaldaea), which is uzvarsh.\"\u2014(Haug, p. 42, quoting J. M\u00fcller.)\n\n3 \"Dilem was the Media inferior, Mazender\u00e2n and the countries between the Caspian and the Tigris, one of the original seats of the Pehlvi (Heeren, Act. Soc. G\u00f6tt. xiii.). Dilem was also a retreat of that language. In the breaking up of a great empire, the institutions of the conquered race always linger in the extremities. The Caucasus, the country of Derbend, Segest\u00e2n, and Kerm\u00e2n, thus sheltered the ancient language and religion of Persia, and thus the mountains of Dilem retained till the tenth century the worship of fire, and perhaps, therefore, the Pehlvi, with which that worship had been connected.\"\u2014James Morier, Persia, etc. (1812), pp. 288, 406.

I have satisfied myself that \u0628\u06cc\u0634 is the preferable transcription; but the question still remains, as to what locality the designation applies. I had suggested, as the nearest sound, Baiza, but Dr. Mordtmann contends for \u0641\u06cc\u0633\u0627 or \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u0627.\u00b9 There need be little difficulty in reconciling these two readings, taken by themselves, as Ibn Khord\u00e1dbah tells us that Fasa was also called \u0627\u0644\u0628\u06cc\u0636\u0627 (Journal\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Mordtmann has hitherto enjoyed the exclusive privilege of describing the Constantinople collections. I am glad to see that the Turks are beginning to appreciate Numismatics in their higher sense, and Western Orientalists may compliment them on the original work of Djevet Efendi, which the French epitomist designates by the title of \"Coup d'\u0153il sur les Monnaies Musulmanes.\" This publication enumerates the following novelties from the cabinets of Subhi Bey, who has since been nominated to the Government of Damascus, where we may wish him every success, on such promising ground, in the further acquisition of new aids to history. 1st.

In addition to these pieces, Djevet Efendi quotes two coins of Abd' allah Zobeir, of Ddrabgird, a.h. 60, and Yezd, a.h. 61.

This table is not only instructive in itself, in defining the geographical distribution of the recent conquests, but may prove of considerable value in testing, retrospectively, the ancient monetary centres, whose designations are so imperfectly preserved in the curtailed and transmutable forms of the old Pehlvi characters.\nThe subjoined list has been compiled by Col. Guthrie, and embraces the latest acquisitions of his own collection, those of the British Museum, and of Mr. Rogers, H.M. Consul at Cairo. The identification of the Mint cities has been revised by Senhor C. Camerino, a brother collector of coins, and an experienced decipherer of Arabic legends.\n\n\u0623\u0628\u0631\u0634\u0647\u0631 Abrshahar, \"cloud city\" (Nish\u00e1p\u00far) 92 to 93.\n\u0623\u0630\u0631\u0628\u064a\u062c\u0627\u0646 Azerba\u00edj\u00e1n (Tabr\u00edz) . . . . . 105.\n\u0627\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0647 Afr\u00edkiah (Africa) . . . . . 103 ,, 118.\n\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0628 Al B\u00e1b (Derbend) . . . . . 118 ,, 123.\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643\u0629 Al Mab\u00e1raka (Africa) . . . . . 108 ,, 119.\n\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0633 Al Andalus (Spain) . . . . . 93 ,, 113.\n\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u064a\u0631 \u062e\u0631\u0629 Ardesh\u00edr Khurra (Khuz\u00edst\u00e1n) . . . 90 ,, 98.\n\u0627\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629 Arminia . . . . . . . . . 100 ,, 107.\n\u0628\u0644\u062e Balkh . . . . . . . . . 128.\n\u0628\u0644\u063a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627 Balkh al Baiza (Daghest\u00e1n) . . . 111.\n\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0635\u0631\u0629 Al Basrah . . . . . . . . . 80 ,, 128.\n\u0628\u0639\u0644\u0628\u0643 B'albec (Syria).\n\u062f\u0628\u064a\u0644 Dab\u00edl (Armenia) . . . . . . . . 84.\n\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0631\u062f Darabgird (F\u00e1rs) . . . . . . 92 ,, 97.\n\u062f\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0627 Dest\u00fa\u00e1 (Khuz\u00edst\u00e1n) . . . . . . 96.\n\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642 Dimish\u1e33 (Damascus) . . . . . . 79 ,, 132.\n\u062c\u064a Jay (Irak Ajami) . . . . . . . . 90 ,, 129.\n\u062c\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0634\u0627\u067e\u0648\u0631 Jandi Sh\u00e1p\u00far (Khuz\u00edst\u00e1n) . . . 80 ,, 97.\n\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062a Far\u00e1t (For\u00e1t Maissan, the Persian Bahmansh\u00edr) . . . . . . . . 95.\n\u0647\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646 Hamad\u00e1n . . . . . . . . . 90 ,, 98.\n\u062d\u0631\u0627 Hur\u00e1n (Ispah\u00e1n?).\n\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0629 Hir\u00e1t . . . . . . . . . 90 ,, 99.\n\u062d\u0645\u0635 Him\u1e63 (Emesa) . . . . . . . . 116.\n\u0627\u0635\u0637\u062e\u0631 Ist\u00e1khar (Persepolis) . . . . . 90 ,, 98.\nI have purposely reserved for separate notice two coins (Nos. 15 and 16) of Mr. Steuart\u2019s plates, which symbolize an independent series, whose types retain their provincial individuality in obvious contrast to the leading characteristics of the ordinary Arabico-Khusr\u00fai mints, and which, in their monetary isolation, revive the ancient traditions and historic romances of the later Aryan conflicts with the ever-advancing Turanians, in their enforced refuge on the southern shores of the Caspian,\u2014a locality singularly favoured by na-\nture, whether in regard to aspect, climate, soil, commercial facilities, or ultimate means of defence,\u2014an oasis in Eastern lands, which in its many obvious gifts impressed alike the Macedonian conqueror, the classic historians, and the Arabs, who styled it the \"White India.\" In more modern times, its luxuriant forests obstructed the progress of the great T\u00edm\u00far, who had to revert to the ethnic axes\\(^1\\) for the passage of his hordes; and in later days, our own adventurous travellers recognized and rejoiced in the unaccustomed notes of its birds, and the sight of its richly variegated foliage backed by the open view of a northern sea.\\(^2\\)\n\nHaving lately had occasion to examine the ancient geography of Hyrcania, with a view to determine the site of the capital of the Parthians at the outset of their national career,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \"I contrived to delineate the head of one (peasant), at the same time representing the manner in which many carry the tabr (\u062a\u0628\u0631) or axe for cutting wood, and the form of this instrument. It is headed with iron, the wooden handle being generally about three feet long. Here I may take an opportunity of remarking, that throughout most parts of this province nearly all the men, several women, and even little children, carried tabrs of this kind, either in their hands, like walking sticks, or resting by the curve on their shoulders.\" \u2014 Ouseley, iii. 269.\n\nPictet, \"Les Origines Indo-Europ\u00e9ennes\" (1859), positively revels in the multitude of Aryan terms for this aboriginal implement, from which the province of Tabarist\u00e1n took its name, and which he pushes up to the dubious sounds of tak-tok, \"the voice of the axe\"; and though in no wise repudiating the heavy stone period, which might have produced a less definite sound, yet still insisting upon the root tak, taksh, but admitting very broad latitudes when he comes to the Persian tabar, tavur, teper, topor, dabar, and Tabidan, Tapak, Taprah, Tapanchah, down to talav\u00e1ri, tal\u00fat, and some further undeveloped coincidences that may suggest themselves to the English reader.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sir T.

Dorn's mission to Mazander\u00e1n in 1860 in the Journal Asiatique, 1862, p. 214.\nI have incidentally met with some curious information bearing upon the general topography of the provinces of Gurg\u00e1n and Tabarist\u00e1n, which I may advantageously recapitulate on this occasion. The leading classical evidence, which is reproduced where needful, has for long past been embodied in print or otherwise fully accessible and open to modern criticism, with the single exception of Ptolemy's comprehensive geography of these Eastern lands, which has hitherto been strangely neglected.\\(^1\\) But, as a general rule, the statements of the Greek and Latin authorities have been tested by European commentators under the single issue of the internal limited and often conflicting testimony of the fragments which have come down to us. In these later days, we have for some time been in possession of very material aid in the more exact definitions and illustrations of the earlier Arabian geographers, whose published texts have recently been largely augmented and improved by our able and indefatigable continental coadjutors; and, finally, the travels of our own countrymen in these unfrequented regions, extending over more than two centuries, have furnished in anticipation a collection of data for the elucidation of much that was previously obscure and unintelligible in the primitive condition of the people who lived upon one of the most important pathways between the old and the new divisions of the Aryan families.\n\nIn entering upon the provincial definitions, we must start from the central point of the earliest capital noticed by the Greek writers. I am disposed to revert, in defiance of all new ideas and combinations, to D'Anville's natural identification of Arrian's Zadracarta\\(^2\\) with the town of S\u00e1ri, which for so many ages irregularly contested with Amol the distinction of the title of the metropolitan city. The Zadp\u00e1 sufficiently accords with a probably faulty transcription of the imperfectly\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There seems to have been a very prevalent idea that Hudson had reproduced the whole of Ptolemy's work. He has done so in regard to the text of certain localities, but for the bulk of the original he avowedly confines himself to very meagre extracts.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u03a4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f26\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u0396\u03b1\u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f39\u03c1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u1f23\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f39\u03c1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f26\u03bd.\u2014Arrian, Exp.

We need not trace in detail the minor stages of this initiative march, the localities themselves remain unchanged, in some cases under other denominations, as occupiers of conflicting nationalities superimposed their own special nomenclatures.\n\nOne instructive lesson we gain, by the way, in following the action of the immutable law of pressure downwards and westwards, and the enforced migration of tribes incident thereto, is the discovery that the ethnic capital of Hyrcania, which gave its \"wolf's\" name\u00b2 to the old kingdom itself, should have been left so far behind, in the redistribution of boundaries, that its primitive site was not even included in the new Hyrcania of Ptolemy's period, but remained with its archaic designation under a slightly modified form to constitute anew the nucleus, and rehabilitate on its own proper ground the veritable province of Jurj\u00e4n, under the Arabs and their successors.\n\nIf I am right in supposing that the subjoined extracts sufficiently explain themselves in the geographical sense, it remains for me only to encounter a hitherto confessed difficulty, in fixing the site of the Parthian T\u00e1\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03be or Ta\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd. This task, under fairly limited concessions, presents but few difficulties. We find the army of Antiochus the Great entering Hyrcania from a vague direction towards the south, marching in irregular detachments, and, finally, appearing before an extensive open town designated by the name of Tambrax, where there was a royal palace. Antiochus then learnt that the bulk of the troops of Arsaces and many of the\n\n\u00b9 \"Erat eo tempore Arsaces, vir sic ut incertae originis, ita virtutis expertae.

There are no positive indications as to whether we ought to seek for the site of this position to the eastward or to the westward of the proximate asylum; but I should, *prim\u00e2 facie*, infer the latter, as the advance of the Seleucidan army, though starting from Hecatompylos, seems to have penetrated Hyrcania by the pass of Fir\u00fazkoh, and to have found itself in the ordinary course impinging upon a wealthy city somewhere between Amol and S\u00e1ri, at a point not far removed from the modern Barfarosh. A locality which must always have presented natural advantages, calculated to recommend it for the seat of a commercial capital,\u00b9 a title it fully regained in later days by its own unaided merits, altogether in default of royal patronage; as we find Jonas Hanway, in 1743, designating it as \"the capital of the province\"; and Forster, in 1784, equally recognizing it without question as \"the capital.\" We must remember that between the time of Alexander's appearance in these parts and the Parthian occupation there had been a change in the manners and customs of the dominant race; and whereas the Iranian dwellers in cities had established their regal domicile within the entrenchments of a strong place, the nomads of the north, on the other hand, kept their camps in the open. City walls would have ill suited a race who were wont, in the fullest sense of the term, to live on horseback.\u00b2\n\nThey possibly built a palace for their king, and distributed\n\n\u00b9 The commercial centre of Hyrcania, on the proximate modern site, is thus described by B. Fraser:\u2014\"The rich and extensive plain in which Barfarosh is placed, affording very considerable supplies of those articles produced in Mazander\u00e1n, constitutes this spot a mart for those commodities; besides which, it is centrically placed in regard to Kasv\u00edn, Tehr\u00e1n, Sh\u00e1hrood, and the interior of Persia (being near two principal passes through the Elburz), as well as to Resht, the capital of Ghil\u00e1n, also a place of very extensive trade. . . . The whole town is built in and surrounded by a forest of high trees; and none of the streets being straight, there is no one spot from whence a spectator can see to any distance. The buildings are indeed so screened and separated by foliage, that except when passing through the Bazars a stranger would never suspect that he was in the midst of a populous city.\"\u2014B. Fraser, Caspian, p. 83.\n\n\u00b2 Equis omni tempore vectantur: illis bella, illis convivia, illis publica ac privati officia obeunt; super illos ire, consistere, mercari, colloqui.\"\u2014Justin, xli. 3.\ntheir model light horse amid suitable pastures, more or less closely around the fixed rallying point. In such a state of society their dwelling places necessarily left but little sign or record behind them beyond the ashes of the camp fires or the impress of the horses' hoofs, and we might seek in vain for any permanent testimony of their passage through far more settled lands. I am, however, content to leave the exact position of Tambrax only approximately determined, because I am under the impression that the name itself simply expresses the Royal head-quarters, or the capital for the time being, in Hyrcania. The word, in effect, seems to constitute a quaintly-devised Greek form of the abbreviated name of the province of Tabarist\u00e1n, consistently corresponding with the undefined \u1f59\u03c1\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 of Ptolemy, the Hyrcana of Ammianus Marcellinus,\u00b9 and thus explaining the retention of the previous designation of \u03a4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03b7 (a variant of Tambrax), in Strabo's text, where the easily-moved capital is stated to have been established [temporarily] at \u03a4\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7. The custom of indicating the province at large, in general terms, without necessarily confining the seat of the ruling power to any given city within its boundaries, is seen to have survived and descended to the later coinage, where we meet with nothing in the entire Pehlvi series but the generic expression of Tabarist\u00e1n.\n\nIt is pleasant, however, amid the coarse savagery of these northern hordes, to find them perpetuating, ex voto, the name of their founder, Arsaces, so that it became a more enduring title than many others of higher and more established pretensions.\u00b2 Singular to say, under apparently identical motives, they retained the typical monogram of Tambrax \u0100, \u2014which has suggested the present inquiry\u2014as one of their\n\n\u00b9 \"Hie amnes duo pervulgati sunt nominis, Oxus et Maxera, quos urgente inedia superantes natatu aliquoties tigres, improvis\u00e8 finitima populantur.

It appears and re-appears in the later coinages, as a nearly immutable constituent of the national heraldic device; wherever the rough camp coining machinery penetrated with the oft-times ephemeral hold of the conquerors, this ancient memorial of the second abiding place of the Arsacid\u00e6, the territorial emblem of the first stage between Caterans and Kings, held its position: and, in the end, only fades out of Numismatic ken, when the more definite strung Bow, the pride of the ancient Parthians, is merged amid the chaotic lines of die-engravers, who servilely copied a device whose import they did not seek to comprehend.\n\nI have now to present in detail the data adverted to in previous pages regarding the geographical mutations of the primeval Tabarist\u00e1n, the classic Hyrcania, which in modern times is known by the name of \"M\u00e1zander\u00e1n.\" These contributions to the previous history of the land range themselves under the following heads:\n\nI.

His longitudes are, of course, utterly worthless, and his latitudes to be received with extreme caution.\\(^1\\) Still, there is in the Greek text a curious vitality and rehabilitation, under due allowance for transfusion of speech, of the Eastern world as existing in his day. Nothing could be more striking than the number of Aryan names of places that we can recognize and restore amid the seemingly unintelligible lists of the Western compiler. But these are temptations which I may safely abandon to M. Pictet, and confine myself to the narrow limits of the Royal cities. The once established capital Tambrax I have already sufficiently adverted to, but those who are indisposed to see so violent a transformation from the generic designation of the \"land of Axes\" must take into account the facility of the Pehlvi transmutation of \\(p\\), \\(b\\), and \\(v\\). The recognized Greek representation of \\(b\\) by \\(\\mu\\pi\\), and the Scytho-Hellenic and other local versions of \\(m b\\), illustrated in the vague pro-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Colonel Yule has a curious note upon what he conceives to be Ptolemy's system of map-making. \"It is evident that he first drew his maps embodying all the information that he had procured, however vague and rough it might be. From these maps he then educed his tables of latitudes and longitudes, and his systematic topography. The result is that everything assumes an appearance of exact definition; and indications on the map which meant no more than 'somewhere hereabouts is said to be such and such a country,' become translated into a precision fit for an Act of Parliament.\"\u2014Cathay and the Way Thither. Hakluyt Soc. Publication, p. clii. On the other hand, we must hear what one of the most precise geographers of the present day has to say in favour of the rough system:\u2014\"Nous profitons de cette occasion pour faire observer que, tout extraordinaire que puisse para\u00eetre l'assertion que les longitudes fournies par une simple op\u00e9ration topographique puissent surpasser en exactitude celles qu'on obtient par des m\u00e9thodes astronomiques, cette assertion n'en est pas moins vraie si l'observateur n'est pas un astronome consomm\u00e9, et s'il n'a pas \u00e0 sa disposition tous les instruments de pr\u00e9cision indispensables pour obtenir des r\u00e9sultats d'une grande exactitude.\"\u2014M. de Khanikoff, Mem., p. 30.\nnunciation of Dambavend, as well as the elsewhere fatal defect of the total absence from the adapted Greek alphabet of any signs competent to reproduce the archaic sounds of ch and j. The terminal k need not any more disturb this attribution, as the final Pehlvi \u06af is admitted to have had the force of a mere h: even if more daring identifications might not point to the interchange of the final, as in Ir\u00e1k \u0623\u0631\u0627\u0642 and Ir\u00e1n \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 (J. M\u00fcller, Journ. Asiatique, p. 15), which would reduce the ethnic term into a mere plural of Axes \u062a\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646, in consistent concert with the Wolves \u06af\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0646 of Hyrcania, or other simple names of places derived from nature's teaching. It remains for me merely to say that I concur in Ouseley's somewhat hesitating identification of Kara Tapah with Ptolemy's \u03a4\u03ac\u03bb\u03ba\u03b1,\u00b9 which is satisfactorily corrected in Strabo's \u03a4\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7. \u0391\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1, as Amol, can scarcely be contested; and without\n\n\u00b9 \"He escorted us to his own village, called from its situation on a tumular piece of ground, Kard-Tapeh or Tepeh (\u062a\u067e\u0647), the 'Black hillock,' distant from Ashraf about seven miles, and in the midst of an extensive level tract, of which the surface was now covered with water and moist clay to the depth of ten or twelve inches, but in summer formed a rich and very fertile plain. Rising above this, the Tapeh or 'mount' appeared like an island barely large enough to contain the houses that stood upon it; all light structures of wood, reeds and straw, except one emirat, a mason-work edifice (of brick), which had been erected for the king's accommodation... I had entertained some hopes of being able, in this Tapeh, to ascertain the position of Tap\u0113, which Strabo describes as the principal or royal city of Hyrkania, advantageously situate within a little distance of the sea.\"\u2014iii. 275.\n\nTwo difficulties presented themselves, however, to the traveller's mind: \"the Turkish name,\" which he did not regard as an insuperable objection, and the absence of ruins, which he rightly met by the remark that \"in the time of Strabo, the houses of this country were most probably constructed of very perishable materials, as in the tenth century after, when Ibn Haukal travelled, and as they are now in the nineteenth.\"\n\nWe have seen how great a latitude is to be allowed in the transcription of native names; but the Kata Tapah is not necessarily Turkish or Scythian: the interchange of l and r was never more free than in Ptolemy's list, where we find \u03bb used in S\u0101ri and \u03c1 in Amol. \u06a9\u0627\u0644 is very good Aryan for black, and \u062a\u067e\u0647 is freely admitted into Persian Dictionaries. The Hindustani equivalents are \u062f\u0645 and \u062a\u067e\u0647. And as regards the possible Palace on the hillock, we must remember that among these nomad tribes the rising ground, or small mounds, as the case might be, were always selected as the natural head-quarters of the chief.\nlaying any undue emphasis upon the possible \u1f08\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1 and the resulting Ashraf, we may safely rectify the \u039c\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1 by the Persian \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06a9\u060c which brings us back to the snakes, whom ancients and moderns alike associated with the locality.\n\nThe rivers in their erratic courses, it must be confessed, present greater difficulties of identification; but there is one impression that forces itself to the front, that the \u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 can only have been some stream more or less associated with the site of the modern designation of Nokandah; the denomination \u0646\u0648\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 implies a variation of the course of a river, either by a convulsion of nature or a diversion by human efforts from an old channel; the name\u00b9 could scarcely apply in these lands of timber towns to new foundations; and one of the most curious points in Ptolemy\u2019s version is that the \u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1 river itself must clearly have joined the \u039c\u03b1\u03be\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1 before the latter reached the sea.\u00b2 Indeed it would \u201calmost seem as if Ptolemy\u2019s informants, whatever names they applied to the two streams, referred merely to the two most important rivers of the country, which seem to have preserved their flow to later days in the modern Ain and Sari, forming a natural junction below the town of the latter name.\u201d\u00b3 This, at least, is what we should be justified in assuming on the authority of the prominently marked courses of these rivers in M. Kinneir\u2019s map.\n\n\u00b9 Some might claim to read the name as \u0646\u0648\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647\u060c but I prefer to follow the Greek, in making it one combined word. More especially, as there is authority for the term \u0646\u0648\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647\u060c which must necessarily refer to ancient usage, in the typical \u201ctrench\u201d of King Firuz, who is reputed to have founded Amol, and whose \u201cbig cutting\u201d still retains the name of \u0646\u0648\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647\u060c\u2014Ouseley, iii. p. 310.\n\n\u00b2 I am quite aware that Sir H. Rawlinson advocates the identity of the Sokanda with the \u201cAb-osk\u00e1n of the Arabs.\u201d (\u0622\u0628\u200c\u0633\u06a9\u0648\u0646 aqua tranquila.\u2014Vullers, p. 3.)\n\n\u00b3 Quintus Curtius also makes his two strangely-designated rivers of Hyrcania join each other (vi. iv. 7), and the almost fabled Zioherus, with its underground current, may have something in common with the newly excavated \u201cNokandah.\u201d\nExtract III.

I have accepted his correction (pp. 175, 182) for No. 5, which has been greatly disfigured by other copyists. See list of variants quoted by M. De Goeje, p. 216, and Sprenger, pp. 52\u20133.\n\nThe excellent edition of Yak\u00fat\u2019s Persian Geography by M. Barbier de Meynard, aided by B. Fraser\u2019s personal narrative,\n\n1 Marhalat (day\u2019s journey).\nenables me to fill in satisfactorily the locality No. 14, which is grievously distorted in all the leading authorities. On the same principle, I should not have dared to correct Istakhri\u2019s \u062c\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0631\u064c, etc., No. 13, into Isidore\u2019s \u1f08\u03c3\u03b1\u03ac\u03ba (Arsak), had not Fraser given us the true form in Ribat-i-Aishk, p. 453; and to the same inquisitive observer I owe the rehabilitation of the lost orthography of No. 12, which seems to have puzzled alike the Arabico-Persian Geographers and their modern annotators.\n\nNo. 7. The site of the wall against the T\u00farks, described by B. Fraser (infra, p. 47), is prominently noticed by Alb\u00edr\u00fani, under a disfigured name, but in the correct locality, as the well-known old boundary between \u201cTabarist\u00e1n and J\u00farj\u00e1n.\u201d (Sprenger\u2019s Map, No. 6.)\n\nThe preceding Arabic list of the names of places supplies a far safer basis for the identification of obsolete native designations than the crudely transmuted and foreign Greek version.\n\n1. Amol may be doubtfully associated with the meaning of \u0623\u0645\u0644 \u201cclean, pure.\u201d\u00b9\n\n2. \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0647 is given in the Dictionaries as \u201ccampus,\u201d and the ground around the site still consistently remains open to this day.\n\n3. \u0628\u0631\u062c\u06cc seems to refer to some bastioned or fortified site, of which there were many after their degrees in these localities, even if the name might not claim to represent a small offshoot of the grand Elburj itself, which the Alexandrian geographer accepted as Bap\u00e1ryn.\n\n4. S\u00e1riah I have already attempted to associate with its domestic Herons.\n\n5. \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u06a9 obviously suggests a development of \u0645\u0627\u0631, M\u00e1r, the ancient and locally cherished name for the classic Ir\u00e1nian Serpent.\n\n6. Ab\u00e1d\u00e1n, \u201cabodes,\u201d in the plural form, is said to have an intensive sense, as prosperity, or flourishing, in the agricultural or resident understanding of the term.\n\n7. The Tamisah of the Sh\u00e1h N\u00e1mah, which the Persians call \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u0633\u0647 opens a wider range\n\n\u00b9 Ouseley, who delighted in ancient identifications, and who had so many opportunities of tracing the old names in situ, quotes from the T\u00e1rikh-i Tabarist\u00e1n a passage to the effect that \u201cA\u2019mul (or Amal) originally signified in the Dilami dialect the same as the Pehlv\u00ed hush \u201cdeath, destruction,\u201d iii. p. 310.\nof conjecture. 8. *Astar\u00e1b\u00e1d*, which was supposed to derive its name from the \"stars,\" has had of late to come down to a much more mundane designation, in the form of the \"abode of mules.\" *Yak\u00fat* is distinct in his assertion of \u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0631\u062c\u0644\u060c and the Sanskrit correspondent readily declares itself in \u092e\u0942\u0932\u0941\u0938\u094d \u201cmulus,\u201d while all natural probabilities point to the advantages of the locality for such stud purposes, more especially in the choice of Nisean horses, to improve the home-breed of that indispensable cross of the patient and sure-footed donkey, for mountain traffic. 9. *Rib\u00e1t i \u1e24a\u1e63\u1e63*, the Arabic designation of the next station, probably merely reproduces the native name for the \u201chy\u00e6na,\u201d who may well have disputed the gorges of the mountains with the \u201cwolves\u201d who gave their name to (10) *Gurg\u00e1n* itself. 11. The *Din\u00e1rzari* of the next stage seems to be a modern combination. 12. *Armutali*, the orthography preserved by B. Fraser, is given with so much hesitation by that author, that it will be wise to avoid speculation upon its derivation. 13. *Ashak* is fixed alike by the Greek itinerary, and the testimony of our modern travellers, as the fountain-head of the greatness of Arsaces. 14. The name of *Samank\u00e1n* is of doubtful origin, but the old designation of (15) *Asfara\u00e1i\u00edn* is good Aryan in the form of \u0645\u06cc\u0647\u0631-\u06cc-\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0646, \u201csun of life,\u201d while the new name is asserted, on the authority of Baihaki, to have been derived from the compound \u201cshield-bearers.\u201d *A\u1e63far* (\u0622\u0635\u0641) \u201ca buckler,\u201d *Ain, \u201claw, usage.\u201d\u00b9 (*\u03a0\u03b5\u03bb\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2.*)\n\n**Extract IV. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 of B. Fraser\u2019s Route.**\n\nStarting from the extreme point eastward, with which we are at present concerned, *i.e.* \u201cBoojnoord (36\u00b0 12\u2032 20\u2033),\u201d the itinerary proceeds, \u201cfifteen miles to Sareev\u00e1n, Killah Kh\u00e1n (Semulgh\u00e1n).\u00b2 The dangerous part of the journey commences immediately on quitting this place: there is a tract\n\n\u00b9 Barbier de Meynard, p. 35.\n\u00b2 \u201cI believe this is the place of Semulgh\u00e1n, which gives its name to the valley. The Fort receives its appellation from being the residence of the Kh\u00e1n.\u201d\u2014B. Fraser, p. 591.\nof more than ninety miles totally desert, through which various passes lead, by which the Tookom\u00e1ns ascend from their plains below, and carry their depredations into the northern provinces of Persia.\u201d *Dehneh Derkesh* (a narrow and rugged pass in the hills that divide the great Elburg range from the smaller mountains and valleys on the north), *Chummun-i-Bansh Killah*, (a plain of considerable extent, which is entirely desert, and sloping towards the west, opens into a still larger one, called, I think, the plain of *Armootullee*. Desert as it now is, there are scattered throughout it many burying-grounds, whose tombstones vouched in a dreary way for the existence of men long since passed away), *Ribat-i-Aishk* (\u201ca ruined caravanserai situated on the slope of the right hand hills, a dismal and dangerous place\u201d), *Gurg\u00e1n river*, *Gurg\u00e1n* (camp), *Pisseruc*\\(^1\\) (near which is a large square inclosure, which had once been the stronghold of a tribe of Eels, called Gereilee, with numerous *Tuppehs* of former villages. The ancient city of *Gurg\u00e1n* (2 farasangs distant; Gumbuj-i-K\u00e1\u00fas described p. 613). *Finderisk*, *Peechuck-Muhuleh* (chief centre of a baluk). *A\u2019k Killah*, \u201cthe white fortress, numerous hillocks and mounds, certainly the remains of former forts and villages. A\u2019k Killah itself appeared to have been an extensive square stronghold. *Asterabad*,\\(^2\\) to *Khurdmuhuleh* (23 miles), to *Nokundeh*\\(^3\\) (14 miles), to *Ashruff*\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This interesting specimen of a true forest town is thus further described. \u201cInstead of dull mud walls and flat mud roofs corresponding exactly with the colour of the ground, to which we had been so long accustomed, we found here everything made of wood. . . . The houses were constructed of posts, wattled and plastered with mud. . . . Instead of a wall to protect the place, a deep ditch had been dug . . . a hedge of reeds and creeping thorns, etc. . . . on the inside served to render the defence more perfect, and it was indeed impenetrable to cavalry. The gates and portals were all constructed of wood; a wooden bridge was thrown across the ditch; the very domestic implements, instead of earthenware or metal, were here made of wood.\u201d \u2014B. Fraser, p. 610.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u201cThe appearance of Astrabad differs from that of cities in the southern and more elevated provinces of Persia, as much as that of the respective surrounding countries from each other. The forest or thicket approach on every side to the very ditch; the houses are constructed chiefly of wood. There are no buildings, public or private, deserving of particular notice at Astrabad. The revenue derived from this little province does not exceed 12,000 tom\u00e1ns, or about \u00a37000 sterling.\u201d\n\n\\(^3\\) A scattered village in the forest. The houses, built \u201cof frames of rudely squared wood, with uprights and beams, raised upon blocks 3 feet above the ground, with a straw thatch.\u201d\n(26 miles). At six miles from Nokundeh is seen \"the ruined wall formerly of considerable strength, and which once extended from the face of the hills to the sea, the boundary between Astrabad and Mazanderan.\"\n\n(Near Ashruff, the ruins of Sufeeabad and the large reservoir in the hills.) Kara-tappah, 7 miles N., also described.\n\nFrom Ashruff to Sar-i-pul-i-Nica (17 miles), open country, fine full stream, etc.\n\nTo Sari, 18 miles; one mile east the river Tedjen, stream broad and strong (Furrahabad, noticed) to Barfarosh, 30 miles, and onwards to Amol (22).\n\nIn addition to the description of the two coins of Tabaristan figured in the accompanying plates, I have endeavoured to complete the Pehlvi and Pehlvi-Kufic series of the Ispehbeds from all available sources. The time at my disposal does not admit of my entering upon the difficult questions of conflicting renderings of the Pehlvi legends, or the complications incident to the use of a double system of dating\u2014the one following the ordinary era of the Hijrah, the other depending\n\n---\n\n1 Sir A. Burnes's route was over much of the same ground. After Boojnoord he mentions Kila Kh\u00e1n, in the district of Simulg\u00e1n; Shahb\u00e1z village (38 miles), the source of the Gurg\u00e1n river, the Atruck river, the Gumbuj-i-Kaus at Gurg\u00e1n, Asterabad, Nokandah, etc. He further notices the recession of the southern waters of the Caspian (ii. 121), and adds, \"during these twelve years they have retired about 300 yards, of which I had ocular proof.\" (See also M. de Kh\u00e1nikoff M\u00e9moire, p. 39). Sari was avoided on account of the plague, but Barfarosh and its port on the Caspian are described (123), as well as the pass of Gudook and Firuz Koh, the real Pylae Caspiae (\"Alexander's route\"), the greatest of the passes into Mazander\u00e1n, p. 130.\n\n2 The distribution of the political power in this division of the Persian empire on the eve of the Muhammadan conquest is thus described by the local historian: \"Sowaid occupa D\u00e2megh\u00e2n sans coup f\u00e9ir. Les Perses s'\u00e9tant retir\u00e9s vers Gorg\u00e2n et dans le Taberistan, Sowaid quitta imm\u00e9diatement D\u00e2megh\u00e2n et marcha \u00e0 leur poursuite. Il arriva \u00e0 Bast\u00e2m, ville du territoire de Qoumes du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Gorg\u00e2n, et y \u00e9tablit son camp. Il y avait \u00e0 Gorg\u00e2n un prince da\u00eflamite, professant la religion perse, appel\u00e9 merzeb\u00e2n, qui r\u00e9gnait sur Gorg\u00e2n et Dihistan; et chaque ville du Taberistan avait un prince que, dans la langue du pays, on appelait ispehbed. (\u0645\u0631\u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 + \u067e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0646). Tous ces princes d\u00e9pendaient du merzeb\u00e2n de Gorg\u00e2n. . . . Or le prince de Gorg\u00e2n \u00e9tait Da\u00eflamite, et les ispehbeds du Taberistan \u00e9taient du Guil\u00e2n. . . . [After the submission of the prince of Gurg\u00e1n the narrative continues:] Lorsque les ispehbeds du Taberistan eurent connaissance de ces faits, ils vinrent trouver leur suzerain, dont ils d\u00e9pendaient tous, et qui r\u00e9sidait \u00e0 Amol, au centre de la province. C'\u00e9tait un homme puissant, un Guil\u00e2ni\u00e9n, du nom de Feroukh\u00e2n, et que l'on appelait l'ispehbed des ispehbeds. . . . Il portait aussi le nom de Guil de tous les Guil\u00e2n.\"\u2014Chronique de Tabari, iii. p. 492.\nupon the local reckoning by the era of Yezdegird, commencing A.H. 32 or A.D. 651-2.

C. RAWLINSON, K.C.B.,\n\nPRESIDENT, IN THE CHAIR.\n\nThe following Report of the Council was read by the Secretary:\n\nThe Council of the Royal Asiatic Society, in submitting their Annual Report, are gratified in being able to show a more favourable proportion between the number of members lost during the past year, by death and retirement, and those acquired by admission, than they had it in their power to lay before the Society at the last Anniversary Meeting. The numbers of losses sustained by the Society, are 8 resident members by death; and 3 resident and 2 non-resident members by retirement, making a total of 12 contributing members removed from our list. Besides, 1 honorary, 1 corresponding, and 3 foreign members have died. The number of elections are 8 resident, and 10 non-resident\nmembers; showing a net result of actual increase, amounting to 5 contributing members.\\(^1\\)\n\nAmong the losses which the Society has sustained since the last Anniversary Meeting, there is none which will excite a deeper feeling of regret amongst the members than that of Lord Broughton, who died in July, 1869. In early life, John Cam Hobhouse was celebrated as the friend and companion of Byron, and the illustrations which he furnished to the fourth Canto of Childe Harold have taken a permanent place in the literature of our country. Very shortly, however, after the publication of this work, Mr. Hobhouse entered Parliament, and devoted himself to politics. Advocating liberal opinions of almost an extreme character, when liberalism was not much in fashion, he soon came into the front ranks, both as a debater and a statesman. He became Secretary for War in 1832, and continued to occupy a post in every Liberal administration which succeeded to power for a period of 20 years. It was during this interval that he first became actively associated with the Royal Asiatic Society. He had joined the Society as a member on its institution in 1823, and always took an interest in its proceedings, but it was not until his accession to the Presidency of the Board of Control, in 1835, that he became entrusted with a share in the direction of our affairs. For twelve years, that is from 1835 to 1841, and from 1846 to 1852, he was \"ex officio\" a Vice-Patron of our Society, and gave us on many occasions the full benefit of his support. At the last-named date, having\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) **Elections.**\u2014Resident: J. L. Allen, Esq.; Col. W. E. Evans; Henry B. Loch, Esq.; Major Gen. C. P. Rigby; Captain R. St. John, P. I. J.

Salaman, Esq. Non-resident: Lieut.-Col. R. N. Tronson; James Zohrab, Esq.\nbeen already raised to the Peerage, he retired from public life, and devoted his remaining years to the cultivation of that taste for letters and classical studies which had clung to him from his early youth. During this latter period of his life he republished with additions his travels in Albania, which had originally appeared on his return from the East with Byron, and also wrote five volumes of Autobiographical Memoirs, which, if they are permitted to see the light, are likely to prove of great public interest.\n\nGeneral Thomas Perronet Thompson was born at Hull on the 15th March, 1783, the eldest son of Thomas Thompson, Esq., a merchant and banker of the town, and formerly M.P. for Midhurst. He was first educated at the Hull Grammar School, under the Rev. Joseph Milner, and in 1798 he entered Queen's College, Cambridge, taking his B.A. degree in 1802, as Seventh Wrangler, and was subsequently elected to a Fellowship. In 1803 he entered the Royal Navy, and sailed as Midshipman in the Isis of 50 guns, the flag-ship of Vice-Admiral (afterwards Lord) Gambier. In 1806 he exchanged the sea for the land service, and entering the army as a second Lieutenant of the \"old 95th Rifles,\" was taken prisoner by the Spaniards with most of the force in General Whitelock's attack on Buenos Ayres in 1807.\n\nThe following year he was sent, through the influence of Mr. Wilberforce, as Governor of Sierra Leone, where he was struck with the unexpected diffusion of the Arabic language in Africa, of which he brought away several remarkable documents, but all eclipsed in point of magnitude by a letter of 39 pages, purporting to be an Address from the chiefs of the interior to the King of England, a desire to translate which appears to have first turned his mind to Oriental literature. Recalled in 1810 for his zeal in suppressing the slave trade, which secretly existed under the name of \"Apprenticeship,\" he joined the 14th Light Dragoons in Spain, and was present at the actions of Nivelle, Nire, Orthes, and Toulouse, for which he received\nthe Peninsular Medal with four clasps. He describes himself at this time as \"a man of very small baggage, consisting of something like a spare shirt and an Arabic grammar,\" which shows that in the midst of the fatigue and excitement of a campaign his Oriental studies were not neglected. In 1815, with the view of perfecting himself in them, he exchanged as a captain to the 17th Light Dragoons in India, where he applied himself earnestly to the study of Arabic under a native teacher, and in 1819 he accompanied Sir William Keir as Arabic interpreter to the expedition against the Wahabas of the Persian Gulf. Here he assisted at the reduction of R\u00e2s-al-Khyma and other places on the Arabian coast, and besides conducting an extensive Arabic correspondence, he took a prominent part in negotiating a treaty with the defeated tribes, declaring the slave trade to be piracy; the earliest declaration to that effect in point of time, though the American one reached England first.\n\nDefeated in 1820, in the expedition against the tribe of Beni Bou Ali, through the misbehaviour of the Sepoys under his command, he returned home in 1822, and commenced the literary and political career by which he is best known, writing the \"Instrument of Exchange,\" the \"Catholic State Waggon,\" the \"True Theory of Rent,\" and in 1827 his celebrated \"Catechism on the Corn Laws,\" which contained the germ of the great Anti-Corn Law League eleven years later.\n\nHe became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1828, and a member of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1829, writing a number of musical, mathematical, and political essays, which appeared chiefly in the \"Westminster Review,\" and were afterwards collected in six volumes under the title of \"Exercises.\"\n\nElected M.P. for Hull in 1835, and for Bradford in 1847 and 1857, General Thompson exerted himself vigorously in the latter year, with tongue and pen, to defend the East India Company, when threatened with abolition, and the Sepoy\nmutineers, when punished after defeat with what he considered to be undue severity.\n\nPromoted to an unattached Lieutenant-Colonelcy of Infantry in 1829, he became Colonel in 1846, Major-General in 1854, Lieutenant-General in 1860, and General in 1868. In 1811 he married Anne Elizabeth, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Barker, of York, and died suddenly and peacefully at Blackheath on the 6th September, 1869, in his 87th year, surrounded by\u2014\n\n\"That which should accompany old age,\nAs honour, love, obedience, troops of friends.\"\n\n\"'Take him for all in all,'\" pronounces a late writer, \"few men have maintained for so long a period a reputation for unswerving devotion to the cause of the people; and there are many still engaged in active pursuits, who can recall the outspoken vigour, the relentless logic, the impulsive humanity of his public action, and the gentleness and manly kindness which marked him in private life.\"\n\nThe late Sir David Capon entered the East India Company's service as an ensign in the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of Native Infantry in 1810, and served with that regiment in the campaigns in Guzerat and the Deccan in 1813 and 1817. He commanded the troops at Aden against the Arabs in 1839, and the 1st Brigade of the Bombay Column at Mooltan in 1848-9; but his active service with the army did not prevent his paying attention to the vernacular languages, in which he became an accomplished scholar, receiving the thanks of the Government for his translations of General Orders and other military works, and being constantly employed as a member of the Examination Committees. He was naturally of a modest and retiring disposition, and his studies never having led him in the direction of those pursuits which mostly engage the attention of this Society and its branches, he never joined us until he retired from active service in 1850; but as a distinguished soldier and one who\nturned his acquaintance with Oriental languages to good account in his profession, he deservedly attracts our notice.\n\nHis translation into Mahratta of Capt. Grant-Duff's History of the Mahrattas has become a standard work in the vernacular literature of India, and has done much to encourage historical composition among the natives.\n\nKarl Friedrich Neumann was born in 1793 at Reichmannsdorf, a village near Bamberg in Bavaria, where his parents, who were of the Jewish persuasion, lived on the proceeds of a small shop. After receiving his first instruction in the Talmud from Rabbis at Bamberg and F\u00fcrth, the boy proceeded to Frankfurt-on-Main, where he was educated at his uncle's expense, and subsequently entered a merchant's office. Dissatisfied, however, with this mode of life, he privately continued with great perseverance his classical and general studies, and in 1817, having sufficiently prepared himself for the University, he matriculated at Heidelberg. Here, with the assistance of academical teachers, such as Creuzer and Voss, he earnestly applied himself to philological studies, profiting at the same time by Hegel's philosophical lectures. In 1818 he proceeded to Munich, where, after one year's study in Thiersch's philological seminary, he passed his public examination, having previously embraced the Lutheran faith. A small scholarship, which was granted him thereupon, enabled the student to finish his academical education by a year's residence at G\u00f6ttingen, where in those days historical studies flourished under such men as Heeren, the two Eichhorns, and Bouterwek. It was here that he published his first work, entitled \"Rerum Creticarum Specimen.\" After his return to Bavaria, he for several years held appointments in public schools at W\u00fcrzburg, Aschaffenburg, and Speier, contributing at the same time to the \"Heidelberger Jahrb\u00fccher.\" Being, however, suddenly suspended in 1825, on account of his free-thinking tendencies, he returned to Munich, and for some time maintained himself by contributing to periodicals, especially\nto the \"Hermes\" and to the \"Literarische Conversationsblatt,\" published by Brockhaus, at Leipzig. Most of these articles were highly valued at the time, and are not considered antiquated even now. By the advice of the palaeographer, Ulrich Kopp, he proceeded to Venice in 1827, in order to acquire the Armenian language from natives of the country who resided there, and having met with a kind reception in the Mechitarist monastery in the island of San Lazaro, he acquired a thorough knowledge of Armenian from the younger Afghien, called Padre Pasquale, who had formerly instructed Byron in that language. The following year he returned to Munich with a complete Armenian library, having been previously created a member of the Armenian Academy in San Lazaro; and soon after he went on to Paris, in order to become acquainted with the great French Orientalists of those days, Abel R\u00e9musat, Klapproth, and Saint Martin. During his stay in Paris, a paper by him was published in the \"Journal Asiatique,\" entitled \"M\u00e9moire sur la vie et les ouvrages de David, philosophe Arm\u00e9nien du cinqui\u00e8me si\u00e8cle de notre \u00e8re.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1829 we find him in London, a frequent visitor at the meetings of the Royal Asiatic Society, and entrusted by the Oriental Translation Fund with a translation from the Armenian of the \"History of Vartan, and the Battle of the Armenians,\" by Bishop Elisaeus. The following year, being offered a free passage on board the Sir David Scott, he started for China, where, during a few months' residence, he managed to gain a certain acquaintance with the language of the country, and where he also succeeded in collecting upwards of 12,000 Chinese books, a portion of which, about 2,400 volumes, he was commissioned by the Prussian Government to buy for the Royal Library in Berlin.\n\nOn his return to England, he published for the Oriental Translation Fund three works, which he had translated during his passage, from the Armenian and Chinese: \"Vahram's Chronicle of the Armenian Kingdom in Cilicia;\" \"The Cate-\nchism of the Shamans,\u201d and \u201cThe History of the Chinese Pirates.\u201d\n\nHis entire collection of books, amounting to 10,000 volumes, was presented by him to the Royal Library at Munich; and the Bavarian Government, in acknowledgment of this service, appointed him \u201cConservator\u201d of the Chinese collections, and Professor of Chinese and Armenian in the University of Munich, in 1832. In addition to his professorial lectures on Oriental languages and literature, he now began to deliver a series of lectures on Universal History, and on Modern German History since the Congress of Vienna, which in a short time gathered around him a numerous auditory from all parts of Germany. At the same time he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Berlin Academy, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe following is a list of the principal works published by the Professor during this period of his life: \u201cHistory of the Emigration of 40,000 Armenians,\u201d Leipzig, 1834; \u201cAttempt at a History of the Armenian Literature,\u201d 1836; \u201cChinese Chrestomathy\u201d (Lehrsaal des Mittelreichs), Munich, 1836; \u201cAsiatic Studies,\u201d Leipzig, 1837; \u201cNatural and Religious Philosophy of the Chinese,\u201d 1837; \u201cAdditions and Corrections to B\u00fcrck\u2019s Translation of Marco Polo\u2019s Travels,\u201d 1845; \u201cMexico in the fifth century of our era, from Chinese sources,\u201d 1845; \u201cHistory of the Anglo-Chinese War, 1846\u201d (2nd ed. 1855). He also edited G\u00fctzlaff\u2019s \u201cHistory of the Chinese Empire,\u201d at Stuttgart, in 1847.\n\nIn 1837 he married the daughter of his colleague, Dr. Schmidtm\u00fcller, professor of medicine. Though his liberal tendencies and strong patriotic feelings did not allow him to keep altogether aloof from the revolutionary movement of the day, he avoided, at first, taking any prominent part in it. Ultimately, the disappointment which he felt at its results found an echo in his lectures on Modern German History, and this caused his suspension in 1852.\nBeing henceforth almost wholly dependent on his pen for his livelihood, he contributed during the following years many valuable essays to Raumer's \"Historical Almanack,\" such as \"The Tragedy in Afghanistan,\" and \"The Sikhs and their Empire\" (1852); \"Persia since the time of the Sefi\" (1855). In the \"Gegenwart,\" published by Brockhaus, he also wrote: \"China and its dependent countries;\" \"Mexico and Central America, and their commercial position;\" \"The English and Russians in Persia and Central Asia,\" etc.\n\nAfter another stay of some months in England, he began writing his \"History of the British Rule in Asia,\" which was published in two volumes, at Leipzig, 1857. Two years later he edited from a Heidelberg MS., \"The Travels of Johannes Schiltberger in Europe, Asia, and Africa, during the years 1394 to 1427.\" In 1861 his \"History of Eastern Asia from the first Chinese War to the Treaties of Peking,\" came out at Leipzig.\n\nThe intrigues of his political enemies at last induced him to leave Bavaria, and settle at Berlin in 1863, where he composed his \"History of the United States of North America,\" in three vols. (Berlin, 1863-66); and also published several essays in Oppenheim's \"German Political and Literary Almanack.\" Already new plans began to occupy the attention of this indefatigable scholar, such as a history of the civil war in America, of the Russian rule in Asia, and similar works, when he was suddenly seized by an apoplectic fit in April, 1867, which deprived him for ever of his intellectual powers. After a life of wonderful labour and the most successful results in various branches of Oriental and historical research, this venerable scholar died in March last, honoured and beloved by all who knew him.\n\nIn proceeding to give a brief account of the progress made by the Society during the past twelvemonth, in Oriental literature and research, the Council feel justified in pointing\nwith some satisfaction to the last number of the Society's Journal, published in January last, which they venture to think deserves high commendation in regard both to the variety and scientific value of its contents.\n\nThey have also much pleasure in stating that not a few highly interesting papers have been contributed to the Society's meetings during that period, and that most of them have been deemed worthy to be incorporated in the forthcoming number, which they hope will be ready at the beginning of Autumn.\n\nIn Mr. C. E. Gover, of Madras, the Society has gained a most valuable and zealous contributor, no less than two papers from his pen having been read within the last four months, both of which manifest a close observation and careful study of the manners of the non-Brahmanic part of the population of Southern India. The first of Mr. Gover's papers gives us a spirited and interesting account of the Pongol festival, which he maintains to be a remnant of primitive Aryan life in India, before Brahmanical refinements and the distinction of caste had corrupted the social aspects of Hinduism, and when the deities worshipped were the same as those invoked in the Vedic hymns, especially Indra, Agni, and S\u00fbrya. Although this attempted identification of an Aryan festival among a race, which, as far as language is concerned, is essentially non-Aryan, may have surprised many members of this Society, still the Council cannot but acknowledge that Mr. Gover has argued his point well, and they desire accordingly to express how deeply interested they feel in his further investigations of the origin and manners of a race, of which we possess as yet so little trustworthy information.\n\nThe second contribution of the same writer is an account of the moral condition and religious views of the lower classes in Southern India, chiefly based on a large collection of popular songs in the ancient Canarese, of which he has given specimens in a poetical, but still pretty close English\ntranslation. Of several of these songs, it is true, a German translation (together with the Canarese text and a grammatical analysis) had already been published in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, vols. 14 and 18, by Dr. M\u00f6gling, a Missionary, formerly resident in the Canarese country;\u00b9 but this would hardly seem to detract from the value of Mr. Gover's paper, which, on account both of its suggestive nature and the additional matter which it embodies, will no doubt be acceptable to the members of this Society.\n\nAt an evening meeting held in March last, the Rev. S. Beal gave a lecture on the Symbolism of the Sculptures of the S\u00e2nci Tope, which was attended by our leading authorities on the subject of Buddhist antiquities.\n\nThe most important point of Mr. Beal's argument was his identification of the Sculptures on the lower architrave of the Northern Gate of that Tope, with scenes in the Vessantara J\u00e2taka; or account of Bodhisatva's last appearance on earth previous to his birth as S\u00e2kya. As Mr. Fergusson and General Cunningham agree in placing these bas-reliefs in the earlier half of the first century after Christ, Mr. Beal's identification will perhaps enable us more nearly to settle the date of the Buddhistic J\u00e2takas; while it also affords another proof of the importance of a minute study of architectural remains in India, for a true appreciation of the history and literature of the Hindus.\n\nTo Professor J. Dowson the Society is likewise indebted for two papers, one of which, containing an interpretation of, and remarks on, a Bactrian Pali Inscription, discovered some time since near Bh\u00e2valpur by the Rev. G. Yeates, and communicated to the Society by Captain F. W. Stubbs, has already been published in the last number of the Society's Journal. This inscription clearly proves that the system of notation adopted by the learned Professor in his previous paper \"on the\n\n\u00b9 A few of them were also rendered into English by the Revds. W. Sanderson and J. Greenwood, and printed in \"The Harvest Field,\" a paper formerly published in Bangalore, but now extinct.\nTaxila Inscription\" was correct, and also that the curve at the foot of a consonant denotes it to be doubled, and not, as had been assumed, to be joined with the letter \\( r \\). Another point of some interest in this inscription is the separation which it exhibits of the words and members of compounds, contrary to the usual custom.\n\nThe second paper, contributed by the same scholar, was an account of the \\(\\textit{Adi Granth}\\) of the Sikhs. The task of translating this important book, which had long since attracted the attention of all interested in the growth and nature of Eastern Creeds, the Council rejoice to state has at last been undertaken under the auspices and at the expense of the Indian Government, by a competent scholar, Dr. Trumpp, who intends shortly to proceed to India in order to avail himself of the services of native Pundits whose assistance is indispensable for the elucidation of that difficult book.\n\nAs, however, the accomplishment of so vast and arduous a task must necessarily occupy several years, Professor Dowson has rendered a good service to those interested in the subject by giving a brief account of the origin and arrangement of the book, and by adding several specimens of its hymns in an English translation.\n\nMr. E. Thomas, in a paper already in the hands of the Members, has brought his well-known palaeographic skill to bear on the Indio-Parthian coins, with special regard to some coins recently discovered in the Government of Perm, in Russia, on which he had been consulted by M. Tiesenhausen, the Secretary of the Archaeological Commission at St. Petersburg.\n\nMr. F. V. Dickins, has contributed an interesting account of the chief cosmical ideas now prevalent among the better educated classes in Japan, taken, for the most part, from the \"Yedo Oho Setsyo,\"\\(^1\\) a kind of encyclopaedic handbook, published in two volumes at Yeddo in 1861.\n\n\\(^1\\) A copy of this work has just been presented to the Society by Mr. W. E. Frere.\nMr. John Beames has continued his philological researches into the origin and connexion of the Indian vernaculars, in a paper \"On the Nexus of the neo-Aryan Languages of India.\"\n\nTo Dr. Schindler, of Teheran, the Society is indebted for a description of the Ruins of Rey; to Mr. T. Steele, of the Ceylon C.S., for some valuable notes on the Antiquities of the Hambantota district in Ceylon, with specimens of Sinhalese Poetry; and to Lieutenant J. Waterhouse, for an account of the Bheel Tribes of the Vindhya and Satpura Ranges. By Mr. V. Fausb\u00f6ll, of Copenhagen, the Society has been favoured with two Legends from the Buddhistic Jataka, in the original Pali Text, with an English translation, annotations, and a highly suggestive introduction.\n\nThe forthcoming number will also contain the third part of the Right Hon. Lord Stanley of Alderley's Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan of Aragon; a third instalment of Mr. H. Fox Talbot's Assyrian Glossary; and the continuation of Professor Kern's Translation of Varaha Mihira's Brihat-Sanhita.\n\nTo the Society's Library many valuable and some important books have been added through the liberality of various donors. To the Secretary of State for India it is indebted for the 2nd and 3rd volumes of the \"People of India,\" edited by Dr. J. Forbes Watson and J. W. Kaye; for copies of \"The Madura Country,\" edited by J. H. Nelson, and \"The Seven Pagodas on the Coromandel Coast,\" edited by Captain M. W. Carr. Lady Elliot has favoured the Society with a copy of the Memoirs on the Races of the N.W. Provinces of India, being an amplified edition of the late Sir H. M. Elliot's Supplemental Glossary of Indian Terms, revised by J. Beames. Mr. E. Norris has contributed the 2nd volume of his Assyrian Dictionary; Mr. N. B. E. Baillie, the 2nd part of his Digest of Moohummudan Law; the Rev. S. Beal, a copy of his translation of the Travels of Fah-hian and Sung-yun; Mr. A. Rumsey, his Mahommedan Law of Inheritance; Prof. Donson, his translation of Ikhwanu-s Safa; Mr.\nP. I. J. Warschanski, his Progressive Hebrew Course and Music of the Bible; Mr. D. F. Carmichael, his Manual of the District of Vizagapatam; Mr. E. Chevallier, the first volume of a Manual of the Ancient History of the East, edited by F. Lenormant and E. Chevallier. The Council have further thankfully to acknowledge the receipt of a Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the Library of Trinity College, edited by Prof. Th. Aufrecht, from Trinity College, Cambridge; from Prof. M. Haug, an old Pahlavi-Pazand Glossary, edited by Destur Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa, revised and enlarged, with an Introductory Essay on the Pahlavi Language, by Dr. M. Haug; from the Parsi Society for making researches into the Zoroastrian Religion, Nos. 6-12 of Zoroastrian Studies; from Pandit Govinda Deva S\u0101stri, his edition of R\u0101ja\u015bekhara\u2019s B\u0101lar\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a; from M. D\u2019Avezac, his Relation Authentique du Voyage du Capitaine de Gonneville; from M. Garcin de Tassy, the 2nd edition of his Histoire de la Litt\u00e9rature Hindouie et Hindostanie; from M. Pavet de Courteille, his Dictionnaire Turk-Orientale; from Count De Vog\u00fc\u00e9, La St\u00e8le de M\u00e9sa; from Dr. A. Ghirardini, Study sulla Lingua Umana sopra alcune antiche Inserzione e sulla Ortografia Italiana; from M. A. Chodzko, his Grammaire Pal\u00e9oslave.\n\nThe Society\u2019s Collections of MSS. and Inscriptions have also been enriched by two very important donations from Captain S. B. Miles, Assistant-resident at Aden, in the shape of two bronze tablets of Himyaritic inscriptions, which are in excellent preservation, and an Arabic MS., containing part of Hasan Ahmed al Hamdani\u2019s Iklil-el-Ansab, a History of the Himyarites, transcribed in the year of the Hijra 1074. In this volume a chapter occurs on the Himyaritic language and Alphabet, and the fly-leaf contains a list of contents of the whole ten volumes (of which this forms the eighth), agreeing fairly with Hajji Khalfa\u2019s description of the work. Captain Miles, who has thus already laid the Society under such deep\nobligations, has further had the kindness to promise that, if he should be fortunate enough to obtain the remaining volumes of the work, he will also transmit them to be placed in the Society's collection.\n\nWhile the Council are thus enabled thankfully to acknowledge the receipt of a great number of valuable books presented by English and Continental scholars, they regret, on the other hand, to be obliged to state that an unusually small number of Oriental Texts has been added to the Society's Library. Although, indeed, much activity has lately been displayed by the native presses of the principal towns of our Eastern dependencies in the cultivation of the ancient and modern literature of India, neither the editors nor publishers of such works have, with one exception, thought it worth their while to give this Society an opportunity to judge of the fruit of their literary and typographic labour, by supplying it with copies of their publications. The Members of this Society are, therefore, left to form their estimates of the actual progress made, in their literary pursuits, by the natives in India and elsewhere, from the records of kindred Societies, and, as far as British India is concerned, from the District Catalogues which, in accordance with the orders for the registration of all printed books and pamphlets, are now pretty regularly issued, and with copies of which the Society is constantly supplied by the India Office. For these reasons the Council refrain at present from passing an opinion on the literary or scientific merits of recent publications in the East, but they take occasion to express their ardent wish that, together with the growing desire of native scholars to join in the noble work of rescuing from oblivion the treasures of their ancient literature, there may arise amongst them a disposition to undergo that gradual but earnest training which can alone instil into them the principles of sound criticism, and thus lay the foundation of truly scientific research, so that the day may not be distant when the native philologer in the far East may take\nhis place side by side with the representatives of Western science. To every Member of this institution it cannot but be a matter of great satisfaction to see our parent Society in Bengal continue as earnestly and successfully as ever its meritorious labours in the various departments of Oriental literary and antiquarian research. The Sanskrit series of the Bibliotheca Indica, which, from various reasons, had for several years made but little progress, has taken a fresh start. Of the T\u00e2ndya Br\u00e2hma\u00f1a three fasciculi have already been issued, and a number of other important works are reported to be in preparation. The Bombay Sanskrit Series, conducted by the Sanskrit Professors of the Bombay and Poona Colleges, presents also a promising aspect, and, though of only a few years' standing, has raised hopes that, with an increased staff of well-trained editors, and commensurate support from Government, it may some day successfully compete with its elder Bengal sister.\n\nThe searching for Sanskrit MSS. has also been carried on during the last year with laudable vigour and decided success in several parts of India, particularly in Bengal, by the indefatigable B\u00e2b\u00fb R\u00e2jendral\u00e2la Mitra; and in Bombay by Professors B\u00fchler and Kielhorn, the latter of whom has just published a Classified Catalogue, containing little short of 600 Titles of Sanskrit Manuscripts, discovered in the southern division of that Presidency.\n\nAs regards the Dekhan the Council cannot, unfortunately, present so favourable a report, as they are not aware that any official steps have as yet been taken by the Madras Government to carry into effect the resolution passed by the Government of India in 1868. This, in the opinion of the Council, is the more to be regretted, as the value of Sanskrit MSS., written in the vernacular Alphabets of Southern India, is beginning to be better appreciated, furnishing as they do, in many cases, a more correct text than the Devan\u00e2gar\u00ee MSS. of the North, and supplying, not unfrequently, texts and variant\nversions, which have not hitherto been known to exist. The Members of this Society cannot have failed to notice the Descriptive Catalogue, now being published by Mr. A. Burnell, of the Madras C.S., in Mr. Tr\u00fcbner's \"American and Oriental Literary Record,\" of an excellent collection of Sanskrit MSS., made by himself during his residence in various parts of the Dekhan. As Mr. Burnell returns to India early in next Autumn he will not be able, for the present, to describe more than his Vedic MSS., but it must be satisfactory to him to know that the portion of the Catalogue which he has already published exhibits several important works, for the most part belonging to the Black Yajurveda, which are either entirely new, or of which incomplete MSS. alone have as yet been discovered in the North. Mr. Burnell (like Sir Walter Elliot, Mr. C. P. Brown, and some few scholars of earlier days) thus shows what benefit a civilian in southern India, who earnestly applies himself to the study of Hindu literature, may be able to confer on Indian Philology by collecting materials and placing the results of his researches before European scholars. The Madras Service, however, has of late evinced but little interest in literary pursuits of this kind, and the Literary Society of Madras indeed has for several years scarcely shown a sign of its existence. It is to be hoped that the few earnest scholars still engaged in Oriental studies may put an end to this unhappy state of indifference, by showing what important problems of Sanskrit Philology and Indian history are dependent for their solution upon the South, and that Madras will thus not stay behind other local Governments in lending its support to the scientific exertions of European and native scholars, but will cordially co-operate in carrying out Mr. Whitley Stokes's scheme of procuring, and compiling lists of, MSS. scattered over the whole of India.\n\nThe contents of the Sarasvat\u00ee Bhand\u00e2ram Library of H. H. the Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja of Mysore have been made known through a catalogue issued, a few months since, by the Bangalore Press,\nand containing the titles of several rare works. Of the Tanjore Library, a list had been printed many years ago, in which, unfortunately, an extremely bad, often unintelligible, method of transcription was adopted; of this list there is a copy in the possession of Professor Goldst\u00fccker, the only one which is supposed to be now extant in Europe. Many parts of the Dekhan, however, have up to this time remained completely unexplored, and still promise a plentiful harvest to future investigators; although, in many cases, it will, no doubt, require the utmost care to overcome the suspicion and superstitions of the Br\u00e2hmans. Of the Namburis in Malabar, for instance, a most interesting, though very retired and secluded class of Br\u00e2hmans, we know next to nothing; yet they are said to be staunch followers of the Vedic religion, and to have in their possession a great many old Vedic MSS. Some places in the Haidarabad Territory also, especially K\u00e2le\u015bvaram on the Upper God\u00e2var\u00ee, are known as great seats of Rig- and S\u00e2maveda learning, and may be expected, when visited and explored, to add considerably to our knowledge of ancient Sanskrit literature.\n\nThere exists already a large collection of Sanskrit MSS. in Madras, which awaits a thorough examination, and the Council of this Society have for some years used their best endeavours to get the collection transferred to England for incorporation with the Library of the Indian Office, with a view not only to rescuing the MSS. from the early destruction with which they are threatened by the ravages of the climate and of the white ants, but also in order to render them more accessible to European scholars. Though their recommendation has not been carried out in full, the Council are gratified in stating that in reply to their application they have been informed by the Government of Madras that it is proposed to build at Madras a Public Library, in which these MSS. will be deposited and properly protected against the ravages of insects, and that the Professor of San-\nskrit at Madras has further been instructed to print a list of those MSS. which he may consider of primary importance, with a view of making these works better known than they are through the so-called Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9. The Council has also been informed that a printed list of MSS. will be communicated to the Asiatic Society, and that any suggestions which may be made by the Society for the transcription of any of these MSS. will receive the attention of the Government.\n\nBy a minute in the Public Works Department, in May, 1868, the Government of India authorized the expenditure of sums not exceeding 13,000 rupees, in each of the four political divisions of the country, for the purpose of delineating and casting some of the more remarkable antiquities of each presidency, with a view to their ultimate conservation. These sums, if properly expended, being quite sufficient to commence upon, great hopes were entertained that the work so long desired by every well-wisher of India, would at last be accomplished by means of this well-timed liberality on the part of the Government.\n\nIn pursuance of this policy, Mr. Terry, superintendent of the School of Design, was despatched from Bombay with a party of modellers, and some of his own pupils, to commence operations on the temple at Ambernath, near Kalyan, on the other side of Bombay harbour. Owing to the novelty of the undertaking and the inexperience of the party, nothing else was attempted during the available season of 1868-9, especially as an outbreak of fever and other unexpected difficulties very materially retarded the work; but so much disappointment was felt at the result that no attempt was made to continue operations during the last cold weather. In the mean time so much difficulty has been experienced in reproducing the casts and photographs that no specimens of either have yet reached this country, nor has any satisfactory report of the results obtained from the labours of the party.\n\nAt the same time another expedition was organized in\nCalcutta, with the object of visiting Orissa, for the purpose of delineating some of the numerous and interesting antiquities of that province. Owing, however, to dissension among the members composing it, and other difficulties, it seems to have been as little fruitful in results as that fitted out from Bombay. They did, however, bring back some casts of sculpture, a few photographs, and several copies of inscriptions, but unfortunately neglected to take casts or photographs of the remarkable sculptures in the Ganesa and Jodev caves, at Udyagiri. These are probably the oldest and most interesting in India, and their attention had been previously specially directed to them. As in the case of the Bombay expedition, none of the results of their labours have been sent home; and no attempt was made to follow up these experiments during the last cold weather. Nor, so far as is known in this country, have any expeditions been organized, either in Bengal or Bombay, for operations during the next season.\n\nIn the meanwhile Dr. Hunter, at Madras, has been most successfully employing the pupils of his school of design in photographing some of the numerous temples which abound in that part of India, and also in casting some of their sculptures; none of the latter have reached this country, but the photographs are a valuable contribution to our knowledge, and, combined with those taken for Government by Capt. Lyon, convey a very perfect idea of the enormous architectural wealth of that Presidency.\n\nDuring the cold weather of 1868-9 Lieut. Cole, R.E., was deputed to Cashmere to photograph and make plans and drawings of the temples in that valley. A work giving the result of his labours is on the eve of publication by the India Office. It promises to be a most valuable contribution to our knowledge of the style of architecture there prevailing, and worthily completes what was so well commenced by General Cunningham in 1848.\nDuring the last cold season the same officer has been employed under the auspices of the Science and Art Department at South Kensington, in casting the Eastern gateway of the great Tope at S\u00e2nci. It is understood that he has successfully accomplished this object, and is now on his way home with the moulds. Lieut. Cole took with him from this country a party of draughtsmen, with the intention of drawing all those sculptures which had not hitherto been delineated by General Cunningham and his brother, or by Col. Maisey. We may therefore hope that before long the means will be available in this country for obtaining a perfect knowledge of that remarkable monument.\n\nBesides these expeditions, which are all more or less dependent on governmental support, Mr. James Burgess, of Bombay, has just completed a splendid work on the great Temple city of Palitana. This work, which is illustrated by 45 photographs by Mr. Sykes, is preceded by an introduction by himself, full of interesting local information and antiquarian knowledge regarding the sect of the Jains, to whom all the temples on that hill belong.\n\nThe same author has also published 41 photographs taken by the same artist during an expedition to the caves of Talaja and Sana, and the temples of Somnath and Girnar. The text to this book is not so elaborate as that of the previous work, but is sufficient to describe and explain the history of the monuments it illustrates.\n\nMessrs. Sykes and Dwyer have also photographed the caves and temples at Nasick and Carlee, but no text has yet been added in illustration of them by any such competent hand.\n\nBesides these, Mr. T. C. Hope, of the Civil Service, has published a valuable work illustrated with 20 photographs by Mr. Lindley, of \"Surat, Baroaoh, and other old cities of Goojerat, with descriptive and architectural notes,\" by himself.\n\nFrom the above it will be seen that our knowledge of the architecture and antiquities of some parts of our Indian Empire\nis progressing, though not so rapidly as might be desired. More, however, may be doing in India than we are aware of here; for unfortunately there is no agency either there or in this country where photographs by amateurs or local societies are collected, or from which a knowledge can be obtained of what is being done in this respect.\n\nIn continuation of their report on the present state of literary and antiquarian research on the Indian continent, the Council now desire to refer to the neighbouring island of Ceylon, and to offer a few remarks on the condition of that seat of Buddhism and P\u0101li learning. They have noticed with no little satisfaction that the P\u0101li language and literature and the religion of S\u0101kya Muni in general have, during the last year or two, received a great amount of attention at the hands of European as well as of Sinhalese scholars. Several important works bearing on these subjects have been published in England and abroad during the past year; and it is but fair to mention that this Society also has contributed its share to the promotion of these studies, as is testified by the communications of Messrs. Childers and Fausb\u00f6ll, printed in its Journal, besides several papers on Buddhistic antiquities. A great and long-felt want will, at last, be supplied by the P\u0101li Dictionary about to be published by Mr. Childers, who, it is to be expected, will by this work give a fresh and more general impulse to P\u0101li studies.\n\nA Sinhalese scholar, Pandit Devarakkhita, has published, a few months since, an excellent edition of the B\u0101l\u0101vat\u0101ra, the most popular P\u0101li Grammar in Ceylon; and the P\u0101li text of the D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya has been promised by another native scholar.\n\nThe Ceylon branch of the Asiatic Society also has just issued a new and highly interesting number of its Journal, containing, amongst other articles, the continuation of Mr. James d\u2019Alwis\u2019 paper on the Sinhalese language, the Aryan origin of which he maintains in an able and convincing\nmanner; together with a Lecture on Buddhism, delivered shortly before his death by Mr. Gogerly, the late eminent P\u0101li scholar, and edited with an introduction and notes by the Revs. J. Scott and D. de Silva. Another number of that Journal is reported to be already in preparation. It is further gratifying to learn that Mr. T. W. R. Davids, a young promising P\u0101li scholar of the Ceylon S.C., has undertaken to collect the P\u0101li inscriptions which are scattered in great number over the island. Whether he may succeed in deciphering, or whether he may have to content himself with copying and publishing, these ancient historical and religious records, Mr. Davids deserves the encouragement and approbation of all who take an interest in these studies; and the Council have no doubt but that the Ceylon Government, which has recently shown its liberality by granting a sum of money for the searching for, and procuring of, MSS., will lend its full support and countenance to so promising and well-timed an undertaking.\n\nAs regards our sister societies on the Continent, the Asiatic Society of Paris and the German Oriental Society, their scientific researches have lost nothing of their wonted vigour and efficiency, and their publications embody, as usual, a goodly amount of useful information in the various branches of Oriental knowledge.\n\nThe number of the American Oriental Society's Journal, issued during the last year, contains the greater part of an important publication, viz., of Professor W. D. Whitney's Taittir\u012bya Pr\u0101ti\u1e63\u0101khya, the Sanskrit Text and Commentary, with a translation of the former, and copious annotations. A new number of the same Journal, which will contain the concluding part of this work, will be issued in the course of the summer.\n\nThe following five members of the Council will go out by rotation, according to the provisions of Art. XXI. of the Society's Regulations:\u2014Major E. Bell, Capt. W. J. Eastwick,\nProfessor T. Goldst\u00fccker, P. B. Smollett, Esq., and Major-Gen. Sir A. S. Waugh. In their place the Council propose to the meeting the following names:\u2014The Right Hon. Lord Lawrence, Sir H. Bartle E. Frere, General A. Cunningham, Dr. A. Campbell, and Claude J. Erskine, Esq. The Council have further to state that General C. P. Rigby having resigned the post of Honorary Secretary, occupied by him in a very satisfactory manner since last June, Mr. T. Chenery, Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic in the Oxford University, has kindly allowed himself to be put in nomination for that office; while in his place as a member of the Council, that body recommends Mr. E. L. Brandreth, of the Bengal C.S.\n\nAUDITORS\u2019 REPORT.\n\nYour Auditors beg leave to report that they have examined the accounts for the year 1869 and compared them with the vouchers, and found them perfectly correct. As anticipated in the last report, the balance at the bankers' remains practically the same as last year.\n\nThey have also formed a careful estimate of the anticipated expenditure for the present year, and find that the income is more than sufficient to meet the demands, notwithstanding that two sums, amounting together to \u00a362, have already been disbursed on accounts that will not again recur.\n\nThe reading of the Reports being concluded, it was moved by Dr. A. Campbell, seconded by Syed Ahmed Kh\u00e2n, and carried unanimously: \u201cThat the Report of the Council, with that of the Auditors, be adopted, printed, and distributed; and that the cordial thanks of the meeting be given to the President and Director for his constant and zealous endeavours to promote the interests and purposes of the Society; and to the Vice-Presidents, Council, and other officers of the Society, for the satisfactory and efficient discharge of their duties during the past year.\u201d\nMajor-General Sir Henry Rawlinson, the President and Director of the Society, then spoke as follows: The exhaustive nature of the Report, which has just been read to you, renders it unnecessary that I should address you at any length in regard to the general progress of Oriental studies, either in this country or in the Eastern dependencies of the British Empire. The only additional matter that it occurs to me to mention refers to the recent proceedings of that department of Her Majesty's Government with which I happen to be more immediately connected; these proceedings being really of considerable interest, and having been, perhaps, hardly adequately noticed in our Report. The Home Government of India, amid the many important matters relating to our Eastern Empire which it has to consider and decide upon, has always recognized the duty of protecting and encouraging Oriental studies. Since last year we have had the advantage at the India Office of the services of a gentleman as Librarian, who acted for many years as Secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, and who is thus not only fully cognizant of the requirements of Oriental science in England, but is also in a position to yield important aid towards meeting those requirements by his recommendation and support. One of Dr. Rost's earliest efforts has been directed to the utilization of the stores of knowledge locked up in the magnificent library which the India Office has inherited from the old East India Company. At his instigation, and under his guidance, a well-considered plan has been adopted for cataloguing the whole of the noble collection of manuscripts which the India Office Library contains. Competent scholars have been assigned to the different linguistic departments, and as they are now all working simultaneously, it is to be hoped that in the course of the next five or six years a \"Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9\" may be completed of all our manuscripts,\u2014Sanscrit, Pali, Zend, Chinese, Thibetan, Arabic, Syriac, Persian, and Turkish. The Sanscrit class has been always known to be of remarkable value, and\nI have strong hopes that it is about to receive a most important addition in a collection of some five hundred works, which Mr. Burnell, a young civilian of Madras, has recently acquired in India, and which he proposes to present to our library, as the most fitting depository of Oriental learning, and the only institution in England where such works can be rendered generally accessible to Sanscrit students.\n\nIt may be remembered that, at the last anniversary meeting of the Society, the publication of Mr. J. Fergusson's admirable work on \"Tree and Serpent Worship,\" under the auspices of the India Office, was duly noticed. The first edition of this work being exhausted, a second is now in course of preparation, and, at the same time, in order to meet the inquiries which have been set on foot in regard to this new and highly interesting field of research, it has been decided by the India Office to incur some moderate expense in exhibiting to the public the original sculptures from which Mr. Fergusson's photographs were mostly taken. The Amravati marbles were obtained by Sir Walter Elliot, in the year 1845, at a cost of several thousand pounds, and were destined by him for exhibition in the Museum in Leadenhall Street. Owing to the translation, however, of the India Office from the City to Westminster, and to the scantiness of accommodation in the present building, his intentions with regard to the due exhibition of the marbles to the public have never yet been realized. For a time the marbles were crowded together in the court-yard of Fife House; and since that locality was abandoned, they have been buried under the India Military Stores in a magazine at Lambeth. It may be regarded, then, as an earnest of our reviving interest in Indian antiquities, that arrangements are now in progress for rendering the Elliot marbles of real public utility, by exhibiting the most valuable portion of the collection in the central covered court of the India Office, while the remainder will be transferred to the temporary keeping of the London Architectural Museum.\nThe Secretary of State for India in Council addressed the Government of India, at the commencement of the present year, on the subject \"of preserving the rich monuments of antiquity in that country, and of collecting and recording in a systematic manner the various memorials of former times, and of the ancient civilization of India;\" and it is satisfactory to know that the appeal has been cordially responded to. The expenses incurred by Lieut. Cole in taking casts of the sculptures at the Sanchi Tope have been mainly defrayed, it is true, by the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington; but the Indian Government gave every assistance in its power in carrying out the objects of the expedition, and has further taken on itself the cost of presenting an entire set of the casts to the Government of France. In the mean time, Lieut. Cole's model of the magnificent gateway at Sanchi, which forms the frontispiece to Mr. Fergusson's volume, has arrived in England, and will shortly be erected at South Kensington, where it will not only serve as a splendid specimen of ancient Indian architecture, but will also supply a valuable desideratum in the history of Art, by linking the East with the West. A series of photographic views of early buildings in Cashmere, executed by Lieut. Cole, have moreover been published by the India Office, and a similar work devoted to the antiquities of Muttra and the vicinity, will very shortly follow. These views, being prepared according to the carbon process, lose something perhaps in delicacy of outline and in artistic beauty, but their shortcomings in this respect are amply compensated by the durability which the new process secures for them, and which puts them almost on a par with lithographs. It is further understood that the Government of India, in accordance with instructions from home, has it in contemplation to organize their Archaeological Department on a more extensive and effective scale than heretofore,\u2014establishing a central agency with power to direct and control researches in all parts of India, and assign-\ning a sum of at least \u00a35,000 per annum for the expenses of such researches, and the publication of their results. It is earnestly to be hoped that the services of a competent officer, who shall be at once a thorough archaeologist and a practical man of business, may be secured to superintend the department.\n\nAmongst other literary undertakings connected with the East, which are due to the liberal patronage of the India Office, must be noticed, firstly, the completion of Dr. Forbes Watson's interesting work, entitled \"The People of India,\" which has been presented to the Society's Library; secondly, the printing at Leipsic of a Grammar of the Sindhi language, compiled by Dr. Trumpp, whilst in the employ of the Church Missionary Society; and, thirdly, the arrangements, now in a forward state of readiness, for accomplishing a translation of the Adi Granth, the holy book of the Seikhs. Dr. Trumpp is the scholar selected for this difficult and important duty, and he will proceed to Lahore during the autumn to commence work with the help of Pundits skilled in the several varieties of the Gurmukhi language. Four years will probably be occupied in the translation, and an aggregate sum of about \u00a32,000 has been sanctioned for the expense of the undertaking. I think, indeed, the Society may rest assured that so long as its President retains a seat in the Indian Council, while its former Secretary discharges the functions of Librarian to the India Office, the interests of Oriental literature are not likely to be neglected, in so far as regards the aid and approbation of the Indian authorities at home, and a liberal encouragement on the part of the Executive Government in India.\n\nBut the Society must remember that the scope of its operations is not limited exclusively to India, or to Indian subjects. We follow with eager interest the progress of research through the length and breadth of Asia. The excavations carried on by Capt. Warren at Jerusalem, on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund, have thus been watched by us with the liveliest solicitude, and though nothing\nhas been yet discovered in the trenches of great historical importance\u2014nothing, at any rate, which is of kindred interest with the sculptural slabs and inscribed cylinders of Assyria and Babylonia\u2014still we are fully alive to the great value of the topographical details which are now coming to light, and which, by defining the extent and characters of the several cities that have succeeded each other on the site of Jerusalem, will enable us at length to identify with certainty most of the celebrated localities mentioned in the Bible, and even to fix the positions of the most famous buildings from the time of Solomon to the Arab conquest. In connexion with the Palestine Exploration Fund, it is only fitting that I should also recall to your recollection the famous Monolith of Dibon, or, as it is usually called, the Moabite stone, which, although discovered by a German, and subsequently secured\u2014so far as concerns the fragments into which the monument is now broken\u2014by a Frenchman, was first brought to the notice of the English public by Capt. Warren. When I called the attention of the Society to the inscription on this remarkable stone, early in the present year, I pointed out that the mutilated name of the King of Israel which it contained was, probably, that of Omri, the founder of Samaria, and this identification, it is satisfactory to find, has since been universally adopted by continental as well as British scholars. I have no wish to disparage the labours of the many erudite Semitists who have written commentaries on the Moabite stone, but I cannot help feeling that the historical importance of this proclamation of Mesha has been much exaggerated. Its value in respect to Biblical illustration is not to be compared with that of the Assyrian inscriptions, which treat of Ahab and Jehu, of the wars of Tiglath-Pileser with the contemporary kings of Israel and Judah, of Sargon\u2019s conquest of Samaria, or Sennacherib\u2019s campaign against Hezekiah of Jerusalem. The Moabite inscription, which refers to a war between Omri and Mesha, unnoticed in the Bible, is chiefly of interest as a specimen of\nPh\u0153nician writing, dating from the 9th century B.C., and also because it shows the Ph\u0153nician character to have been in ordinary use at that period beyond the Jordan, and thus leads to the inference that, as this earliest type of Semitic writing was common to the nations both to the east and to the west of Palestine, so it must also, in all probability, have been the native character, both for cursive and lapidary purposes, of the intermediate region inhabited by the Jewish tribes. The Ph\u0153nician legends, copied from the Ninevite tablets, which were published by me in the Society's Journal for 1865, do not, probably, in any case belong to an earlier period than the 8th century B.C., so that they must yield, in point of antiquity, to the Moabite inscription, which is, indeed, the most ancient document, in the Ph\u0153nician character, that has been yet discovered.\n\nIn connexion with this subject, I may also report to the Society firstly, that, the third volume of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia is now being bound up and indexed, and will be ready for distribution during the autumn; and, secondly, that as the Trustees of the British Museum have granted a further sum in order to defray the expense of continuing the work, I am making preparations, in conjunction with Mr. G. Smith, of the Antiquity Department of the Museum, who is the most promising Cuneiform scholar of the day, for commencing a fourth volume, which will be principally devoted to a collection of the ancient Bilingual Prayers, Hymns, and Liturgies of Assyria and Babylon. The Society will be further glad to learn that there is a prospect of the resumption of the Assyrian excavations during the coming year, as the authorities of the British Museum seem to be daily impressed with the importance, both of completing our present Ninevite materials, and of acquiring fresh documents from hitherto untried localities, and will thus, probably, in the ensuing session recommend a renewed Parliamentary grant.\n\nThe publication of the second volume of Mr. Norris's\nAssyrian Dictionary during the past year, bearing evidence as it does to that eminent scholar's indefatigable industry and unabated powers of analysis and comparison, has been hailed by Cuneiform students with intense satisfaction, and has everywhere elicited the earnest hope that the author's life may be spared to complete the work which he has so auspiciously commenced. Before quitting this topic, I must also draw attention to a series of articles on the Cuneiform Tablets which Mr. George Smith has recently published in the \"North British Review,\"\u00b9 and which in regard both to historical discovery and to the general results obtained from the interpretation of the inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia, are far in advance of anything that had been previously published on the subject, either in this country or on the Continent.\n\nAnother point to which I must briefly allude is the opening of the Suez Canal. In the autumn of last year, during the recess, I received an invitation from H.H. the Viceroy of Egypt, to attend the ceremony of opening the Canal in my capacity of President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. As I was unable to absent myself for so long an interval from my duties at the India Office, whilst at the same time I felt that our Society ought to be represented on an occasion fraught with such important consequences to our future relations with the East, I requested Major-Gen. Sir Andrew Waugh to proceed to Egypt in my place, as the delegate of the Council. He assented cheerfully to the proposal, and was on the point of leaving England when a severe attack of illness put a stop to all his arrangements, and confined him for several weeks to the irksome seclusion of a sick chamber. Our Society, therefore, was un-\n\n\u00b9 No. 101. On Norris's Assyrian Dictionary, Part I.\u2014102. Babylonian and Assyrian Libraries.\u2014103.

Menant's \"Le Syllabaire Assyrien.\"\u2014105. \"Les Inscriptions de Dour-Sarkayan,\" par Dr. Jules Oppert.\nfortunately unrepresented on the occasion in question, but we have not been the less interested in the successful termination of a work which, whatever may be its present political bearing, or its future financial prospects, must undoubtedly greatly promote the intercourse between Europe and India, and thus tend to the increasing development of the exhaustless resources of the East.\n\nThe only other point to which I feel inclined to refer is the mission about to be despatched, by the Viceroy of India, to the Chieftain who has recently established an independent sovereignty in Kashgar and Yarkend, and who is our next neighbour across the Himalaya and beyond the Thibetan dependencies of Cashmere. The Society cannot but feel intensely interested in the success of this expedition into Central Asia. There is no reason to anticipate that Mr. Forsyth's mission will encounter any great difficulty or danger, since Messrs. Shaw and Hayward, who have recently returned in safety from the same country, have already tested both the practicability of the route and the good feeling of the Governor; but in regions so rarely visited our officers will necessarily gain much novel experience. There are many matters indeed connected with the Geography, the Ethnology, and the Literature of Chinese Turkestan, on which information is greatly needed; and we may thus hope that the visit of this mission to the court of the Ataligh Ghazi will be fruitful in discovery, and will, in fact, so to speak, open up a new page in our knowledge of the East. The papers of Messrs. Shaw and Hayward, which have been already published, are of extreme value, and only render us the more anxious for further details.\n\nFinally, I would strongly impress upon the Fellows of this Society the necessity of sustained exertion in two directions: firstly, in obtaining the pecuniary means, of which we stand so greatly in need, for the due extension of our means of usefulness, by inducing fresh subscribers to join our ranks; and, secondly, in arousing that literary spirit and power,\nwhich undoubtedly our members possess, but which requires to be called into activity in order to enable us to hold our place amongst the Orientalists of Europe, and to transmit to our successors that high reputation for learning and research which we have inherited from such scholars as Wilson, as Colebrooke, as Sir Wm. Jones.\n\nIn conclusion, Sir Henry read the following list of Oriental Works of importance which have been published during the past year:\n\n**Sanscrit:** Dr. J. Muir's Original Sanskrit Texts, vol. V.; Prof. Max M\u00fcller's Translation of the Rig-veda, vol.

BAILLIE, Auditors for the Society.\nHENRY LEWIS,\nAt the opening Meeting of the Society, on November 21st, 1870, Sir H. Rawlinson delivered the following introductory address:\n\nAs this is the opening meeting of the Session, it may be convenient that I should offer a few remarks in continuation of my address at the last Anniversary Meeting, with a view of reporting briefly on such matters of interest to us as have occurred during the recess, and thus keeping you au courant as to the present state of Oriental study and research.\n\nTo commence then with the subject which chiefly occupied my attention on the last occasion, our literary proceedings at the India Office\u2014I may note that in the work of cataloguing the MSS. of our Library, we are making steady and satisfactory progress, while we are also receiving the most valuable additions to our already large stock of materials. Mr. Burnell, whose collection of Sanscrit MSS. I stated that we hoped to obtain, has deposited his treasures on the shelves of our Library, thus offering a noble example of scholarly assiduity on the one side, and of disinterested public spirit on the other. This collection numbers about 350 volumes, and is particularly rich in the Vedic department. Indeed, I see by the Catalogue he has published, that there are no less than 230 MSS. referring to the Vedas and Upanishads. We have also received, from H.H. the Viceroy of Egypt, about 200 Arabic volumes printed in Cairo, including standard historical works like Ibn Khaldun and El Makkari, and others of almost an equally high character. In return for these, we shall pre-\nsent His Highness with copies of such Arabic works as have been printed in India.\n\nA further subject of congratulation is the appointment of General A. Cunningham to superintend the Archaeological Survey of India. The Government of India, having resolved to take in hand a work of this magnitude and importance, has been very fortunate in securing the services of one of the very few officers\u2014if not the only officer\u2014who is thoroughly competent to conduct the survey. General Cunningham will leave for India at the beginning of next month, and will proceed at once to take charge of the Central Office, where he will organize an efficient staff to assist him in exploring the antiquities of India, in copying inscriptions, excavating ruins, taking plans of ancient buildings, and in the various other operations connected with his laborious but most interesting duty.\n\nIn connexion with this subject, I may further observe that the Elliot marbles have been at length rescued from the obscurity that has been so much deplored, and are now carefully arranged in the Central Court of the India Office, where they invite the inspection of the curious. I need hardly remind the meeting that these are the original marbles of the Amrawati Temple, the photographs of which have been so largely and advantageously employed for the illustration of Mr. Fergusson\u2019s late work on Tree and Serpent Worship.\n\nLieutenant Cole\u2019s cast of the Eastern gateway at the Sanchi Tope, is also, I understand, in the course of erection at South Kensington, and the Science and Art Department of the Government are making arrangements for a further supply of architectural casts, both from Agra and Futtehpoor Sikri, and from the Colonnade of the Kutb Min\u00e1r at Delhi.\n\nI may now say a few words on the various Oriental publications which have appeared during the recess, or which are known to be in a forward state of publication.\nIn the Sanscrit department, Mr. Griffiths, of Benares, is employed in translating into English verse V\u00e1lm\u00edki\u2019s poem of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, and the first volume of his translation has already appeared.\n\nMessrs. West and B\u00fchler have also completed the second volume of their Digest of Muhammadan Law, and R\u00e1jendra-l\u00e1l Mitra has published a portion of his Catalogue of Sanscrit MSS., the first result of the search for such materials in Bengal.\n\nMr. J. Burgess, of Bombay, has likewise issued a Memorandum on the survey of the Architectural and other Arch\u00e6ological remains of Western India, which contains much valuable information; and I may conclude this branch of the subject by drawing attention to two other works, which are announced for publication: one is Mr. J. Beames\u2019s \u201cComparative Grammar of the modern Aryan Languages of India,\u201d and the other is General Cunningham\u2019s \u201cGeography of Ancient India,\u201d the result of thirty years of patient study and research.\n\nIn the P\u00e1li branch, the chief activity has been shown in Ceylon, where the Government, in the first place, has directed an Arch\u00e6ological Survey of the Island to be undertaken by Mr. Davids, assisted by a competent staff; and where Mr. James D\u2019Alwis is compiling (also under the orders and at the expense of the Government) a complete Catalogue of all the Buddhistic MSS. in the Island. The first volume of this Catalogue is about to be published.\n\nIt is further worthy of notice that the King of Burmah has presented to the Ceylon Government a complete set of the Buddhistic Scriptures, His Majesty being a great patron of Buddhistic studies in his own country, and having printed a P\u00e1li Grammar written by himself.\n\nThe last number, also, of the Journal of the Ceylon branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, should be noticed as of great interest to P\u00e1li Students.\n\nIn the Chinese department, attention should be drawn to\nthe \"Phoenix,\" which is a new Monthly Magazine for China, Japan, and Eastern Asia, conducted by the Rev. Mr. Summers, and which promises to be very useful. Mr. Stanislas Julien has also brought out the second volume of his \"Syntaxe Nouvelle de la langue Chinoise,\" and Mons. Paul Perny has published his \"Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7ais-Latin-Chinois de la langue Mandarine parl\u00e9e,\" to be followed by a Grammar of the same tongue; while Sir John Davis has given us a Second Edition of his \"Poetry of the Chinese,\" with some additions and improvements.\n\nIn Semitic Literature, the following works are chiefly deserving of notice:\u20141. The sixth part of the Kamil of E. Mubarrad, published by Dr. Wright; 2. A translation of the Fihrist of the famous Nedim, which is being printed from the late Professor Fl\u00fcgel's MS.; 3. Catalogues of the Syriac and Arabic MSS. in the British Museum, compiled respectively by Drs. Wright and Rieu, and now in the Press; and 4, The Diwans of the six ancient Arabic Poets, En-Nabiqa, Antara, Tarafa, Zoheir, Alqama, and Amrulqeis, just published by Prof. Ahlwardt. Our own Oriental Translation Fund, which has still a small sum in deposit, has also made arrangements with two very competent scholars for two important publications. Mons. Zotenberg, who has done us the honour of assisting at this meeting, is employed on a translation of Tabari, independently of the version which was commenced by Dubeux many years ago; and Professor Sachau is to supply an English version of Ab\u00fa Rih\u00e1n's famous work entitled the Ath\u00e1r-el-B\u00e1kiya\u2014a copy which was made for me, from a very ancient and correct exemplar, in the Library of the King's Mosque at Teheran, having been entrusted to him for the purpose.\n\nBut while I announce to the meeting these various subjects of congratulation, I am bound to say that in some other respects we have not been so successful\u2014that the expectations, indeed, which I held out in my address of last May have, in some cases, not been realized.\nIn the first place, considerations of economy have decided the Trustees of the British Museum against applying for Government assistance to enable us to resume excavations in Assyria and Babylonia; and as it is very doubtful whether sufficient private funds could be obtained for the purpose, the scheme may be considered to be adjourned *sine die*. Secondly, the adventurous traveller Mr. Hayward\u2014from whose exploration of the Panier Steppes I anticipated important results\u2014has, I deeply regret to say, been foully murdered on the threshold of the new field he was about to enter. And thirdly, Mr. Forsyth, to whom I also referred in my last address as engaged on a Mission to Central Asia, full of interest to the Geographer, the Politician, and the Historical inquirer, has been obliged to return from Yarkend, after a very brief sojourn, without seeing the Governor of the country, or carrying out the chief objects of his journey.\n\nThe onward progress of Oriental research will not, however, be seriously impeded by such mishaps. Let us at any rate, as Members of the Royal Asiatic Society, do our duty to each other, and to the good cause to which we are devoted. Let us cordially welcome our fellow-labourers in the field, whenever, as at present, they do us the honour to attend our meetings; and let us one and all, both by contributing papers and by exertions amongst our friends, do our utmost to maintain the reputation of the *Journal*, and increase the numbers and resources of our Society. The Session of 1870\u201371 is now formally opened.\nThe following Report was read by the Secretary:\u2014\n\nIn presenting, as is usual on this occasion, their Report on the proceedings of the Society during the last twelvemonth, the Council, though unable to show any material improvement in the number of subscribers, have some satisfaction in stating that there has been, at least, a slight increase of members during that period. The number of elections since the last Anniversary Meeting are eight resident and five non-resident members; whilst the losses, by death and retirement, amount to seven resident and two non-resident members; showing an increase of one resident and three non-resident members.\n\n1 Elections.\u2014Resident: Major H. H. Godwin Austen; G. Branson, Esq.; L. Bowring, Esq.; R. N. Cust, Esq.; Capt. A. F. P. Harcourt; Dr. R. S. Mair; Sir D. F. McLeod; Prof. J. Pickford. Non-Resident: H. F. W. Holt, Esq.; C. P. Lutchmeepathy Naidu, Esq.; Moulvi Syud Imadad Ally; S. Harvey James, Esq.; Charles Grant, Esq.\n\nDeaths.\u2014Resident: J. Henderson, Esq.; Mrs. Manning; M. C. Morrison, Esq.; Sir Justin Sheil. Non-Resident: Capt. M. W. Carr.\n\nRetirements.\u2014Resident: Sir F. Halliday; Col. H. A. Ouvry; Gen. C. P. Rigby. Non-Resident: W. M. Beaufort, Esq.\nIn Mrs. Charlotte Manning, daughter of the late Isaac Solly, Esq., the Society has lost a member who always evinced the liveliest interest in everything that interests this Society, and very frequently attended its meetings. In 1856, she, (then Mrs. Speir) published, \"Life in Ancient India,\" a book which combined careful study with an unusual grace of style, and stimulated many minds to an interest in Sanskrit writings. A year and a half ago she almost entirely re-wrote this work, and it appeared under the title of \"Ancient and Medi\u00e6val India,\" in an enlarged form, with the addition of much information from sources that had been only discovered in the last few years. It is remarkable for the accurate learning and the patient research which it manifests; and though Mrs. Manning was not acquainted with Sanskrit, her powers of discernment and judgment qualified her peculiarly for selecting the best authorities on the subjects that she dealt with, so that the book is very useful to the student, while her refined taste and her appreciation of the beautiful have rendered it also very attractive to the general reader.\n\nMrs. Manning was, however, not only distinguished by her literary productions. Her influence in society was of a marked kind. With a naturally keen enjoyment of social intercourse, and with very cultivated faculties, she had also a peculiar skill in drawing forth the intellectual elements, and the best qualities of those with whom she came in contact, and she took delight in bringing together minds in which she perceived points of harmony. Moreover, her ready sympathetic insight gave an extreme charm to her conversation. Her interest was strong in all original and conscientious labours in the fields of literature, science, and art. She also helped forward zealously various schemes for the improvement of education, and latterly had been occupied with efforts for the benefit of our Indian fellow-subjects, many of whom felt towards her a warm personal esteem,\nmixed with sincere gratitude. Having the habit of extracting experience from all the events and phases of life, she gladly imparted from her stores of practical wisdom to those who were attached to her, and when her counsel was asked, she usually refrained from solving the particular problem, preferring simply to place before her friend a standard of right, in the confidence that by this means the desired result would be best attained. The balance and proportion in her nature, her quiet dignity, her retiring disposition, and her thoughtful generosity and kindliness, have left a powerful impression on all who knew her, and these characteristics rested on the firm basis of a calm enlightened faith, and an unwavering allegiance to duty.\n\nAttempts have, at various times and by various means, been made on the part of the Council to induce a more numerous portion of the public to devote some of their attention to those branches of knowledge in the cultivation of which this Society, during the long course of its existence, has taken so prominent and so active a part. These endeavours, it is to be regretted, have not been hitherto as successful as might have been desired; and it cannot be denied that for many years less attention has been paid by the public at large to Oriental literature and antiquities, in this country,\u2014close as its connexion is with the East\u2014than has been paid on the Continent. The Council do not, however, despair of yet succeeding, by their earnest and unremitting labours, in promoting a livelier interest in, and a more accurate appreciation of, the results of Oriental research; and they earnestly appeal to those who participate in such pursuits for their hearty co-operation in popularizing the objects of this institution and increasing the list of its supporters. They cannot, on the other hand, lose sight of the consideration that it is mainly by the intrinsic merits and scientific value of its publications that this Society can\nexpect to retain that high position in Oriental literary and antiquarian research to which it has hitherto been so justly entitled. That nothing has been wanting in this respect during the preceding year, the Council confidently trust, is amply proved by the contents of the last number of the Society's Journal, published at the beginning of the present year. Although there has not perhaps been so large a supply of papers as the Council could have wished to select from for publication in the next number, which is now printing, still the meetings of the Society have never been entirely without communications of interest. Of these, some have already appeared in the Journal, viz., General Cunningham's Mathura Pali Inscriptions, with Professor Douson's translation and remarks; Mr. A. Wylie's highly interesting account of the Buddhist Inscription at Keuyung kwan, in six different alphabets, and including a specimen in the Neuchih language; and Mr. C. P. Brown's account of the origin and chief tenets of the Jangams or Lingavats.\n\nTo Professor J. Pickford and Mr. C. E. Gover the Society has been indebted for papers attempting to establish a radical connexion between the Dravidian and Aryan groups of languages.\n\nA second paper contributed by Mr. Gorer contains a collection of popular songs translated from the Badaga tongue, with remarks on them; this paper being a continuation of a former essay on Canarese popular songs, by the same writer, noticed in last year's report. The songs now communicated are equally interesting and poetical with the Canarese songs, most of which had already been published\u2014the text with a German translation and grammatical analysis\u2014by Dr. M\u00f6gling. We must, however, regret that Mr. Gover has not chosen to give, along with his translation, the original text, which would have been a welcome addition to our knowledge of Dravidian literature.\nAt a recent meeting, Professor Chenery read a paper on a Manuscript in the Bodleian Library, containing a Hebrew translation, or imitation, of the first twenty-six Mak\u00e1m\u00e1t of El-Hariri, by Judah ben Solomon, called Alcharizi, the author of the Tachkemoni.\n\nThe work which Professor Chenery is now publishing consists, like the Tachkemoni, of rhymed prose and of verse modelled on Arabic metres, the phrases of the Koran and the references to Arabic history and legend being replaced by phrases of the Bible and allusions to Biblical incidents. The author was born at Xeres in Spain, and flourished in the early part of the thirteenth century.\n\nA specimen of the \u00c2di Granth of the Sikhs in the original text, with a translation and critical notes, has been communicated by Dr. E. Trumpp, who is now engaged in translating that important work, at the expense of the British Government.\n\nAt an evening meeting held on February 6th last, Dr. C. D. Ginsburg, before a very numerous attendance, delivered a lecture on the Moabite Inscription, in which he placed before the Society the latest results of his study of the Dibon document. Our learned President, on the same occasion, showed how the historical inferences drawn from the Moabite stone were entirely borne out by the Assyrian Annals recorded on the black obelisk from Nimr\u00fad, now in the British Museum, which was a monument of nearly the same age as the Dibon monolith. Sir Henry also stated that the Moabite war, as described on that document, must have taken place from B.C. 849 to about 846, as appeared from the Assyrian Canon, the chronology of which was fixed by the record it contained of the great solar eclipse at Nineveh on June 15, B.C. 763.\n\nCaptain Burton, further, has communicated a collection of Syrian proverbs, with a translation and remarks; Mr. W. F. Mayers, a paper on the introduction of maize into China, with an introductory note by Dr. D. F. Hance.\nMr. R. C. Childers has read, at a recent meeting, remarks by him on some passages of the Dhammapada, with special reference to the question of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, and in support of his view that Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is a state of blissful freedom from human passion on earth, followed by annihilation after death. He also submitted to the meeting an able paper by L. Comrilla Vijasimha Mudliar, a native of Ceylon, dealing with the origin of the Arthakath\u00e2s, or commentaries on the Buddhist scriptures. Both these papers, as likewise those of Dr. Trumpp and Captain Burton, will be incorporated in the next number of the Society's Journal, which will also contain the continuation of Dr. H. Kern's translation of the Brhat-Sanhit\u00e2, of Lord Stanley of Alderley's Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan and Mr. H. F. Talbot's Assyrian Glossary.\n\nThe Council have to acknowledge, with their cordial thanks, the receipt of a number of valuable additions to the Society's library, consisting partly of Transactions of learned Societies in England and abroad, partly of works presented by their authors or other patrons of the Society.\n\nFrom the Bombay Government the Society has received a copy of the Poems of Tuk\u00e2r\u00e2ma; from M. J. Oppert, his Inscriptions de Dour Sarkayan; from Syed Ahmed Khan, his Essays on the Life of Muhammed; from Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit Govinda Dera \u015a\u0101stri, his edition of the B\u0101lar\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a; from Dr. G. K. Niemann, his Bloemlezing uit Maleische Geschriften; from the Rev. J. Kessler, his Introduction to the language of Madagaskar. To Lady Elliot we are indebted for Vol. III. of the late Sir H. M. Elliot's History of India, edited by Professor J. Dowson; to Mdme. Dora d'Istria, for copies of her Filetia et Arbenor\u00e9 and Etudes Indiennes; to M. Garcin de Tassy, for Vol. II. of his Histoire de la Litt\u00e9rature Hindouie et Hindostanie; to Mr. E. Thomas, for his Chronicles of the Path\u00e2n Kings of Dehli; to Mr. C. Grant, for his Central Provinces Gazetteer; to Mr. Lepel H. Griffin, for his Rajahs of the Punjab. Mr. E. H. Palmer has\npresented a copy of his Catalogue of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish MSS. of Trinity College, Cambridge; Professor A. Weber, his treatise on the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. From the Trustees of the British Museum has been received a copy of Dr. Wright's Catalogue of Syriac MSS.; from the Academy of Leiden, Vol. III. of Professor Land's Anecdota Syriaca; from the Batavian Society, a number of copies of Kawi Copperplate Inscriptions.\n\nTo Captain S. B. Miles, Assistant-Resident at Aden, the Society is again indebted for a very valuable donation, consisting of an Himyaritic bronze tablet, an alabaster sepulchral slab with a bas-relief figure and Himyaritic characters; a silver talisman or seal, likewise with Himyaritic letters engraved on it; a small brass figure supposed to be a Himyarite god, from its having been dug up at Mareb; two Ethiopic gold coins, and finally, two Himyaric coins, a silver and a gold one, the first hitherto discovered.\n\nIn now proceeding to take a brief and necessarily superficial survey of the labours of Oriental scholars during the preceding twelvemonth, the Council need scarcely observe that the disturbed state of the Continent since the middle of last year could not but have occasioned a serious decrease of publications in this, as indeed in every branch of literary and scientific research. The publications of our own Translation Committee have had to suffer a delay for the same reason, M. De Slane having been prevented from issuing the fourth and last volume of his English translation of Ibn Khallikan's important Biographical Dictionary, while M. Zotenberg has been compelled to suspend the printing of the third volume of his French translation of Tabari.\n\nAs, after the completion of the latter work, which will consist of four volumes, a sufficiently large sum will still remain at the disposal of the Committee, they have entered into an engagement with Prof. E. Sachau for an English translation of Albiruni's highly important work Al'\u0101th\u0101r\nAlb\u0101kiya, which it is anticipated will be ready for the press in the latter part of next year.\n\nA rare example of what true devotion to science may work, even in the midst of the chaos of war, has been shown by one of our foreign members, M. Garcin de Tassy, who has found it possible to go on with the publication of the second edition of his History of Hindi and Hindustani literature, two volumes of which have appeared, containing a vast amount of new and highly useful matter. Nor has that scholar allowed himself to be prevented from issuing his annual Discours d'ouverture, though not on this occasion from his professorial chair in the French capital, but from the quiet seclusion of a provincial town.\n\nNorthern Indian Vernacular philology has also, as usual, received some attention in last year's Journal and Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, in B\u00e1b\u00fb Prat\u00e1pachandra Ghosha's Contributions towards Vernacular Lexicography, and in short Kashm\u00eer\u00ee and Gondi vocabularies by Dr. W. J. Elmslie and the Rev. J. Dawson. With regard to the U\u1e5biy\u00e2, the language of Orissa, there has been some variance of opinion: B\u00e1b\u00fb K\u00e1ntichandra, to some extent backed by B\u00e1b\u00fb R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra, contending that it is a sort of dialect of the Bengali, whilst Mr. J. Beames takes it to be, like the Bengali, an independent neo-Aryan language.\n\nDr. E. Trumpp's labours in translating, for the Indian Government, the \u00c2di Granth, have already been adverted to; it may further be mentioned that he is now printing, likewise at the expense of the Indian Government, a Grammar of the Sindhi, as compared with the North-Indian vernaculars. The first part of a compilation by Janamejaya Mitra, entitled Nuskh\u00e1 i dilkush\u00e1, containing notices and selections from the works of 380 Urdu poets, was printed as long back as 1854, but has only lately been published, after the compiler's death, by his son, B\u00e1b\u00fb R\u0101jendra. A volume of Hindi Selections has also been printed by \u015aivapras\u00e2da. Under the\npatronage of the Bombay Government, the first of two volumes which are to contain a complete collection of the Abhangas, or songs of the M\u0101r\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b poet Tuk\u0101r\u0101ma, who appears to have flourished in the earlier half of the seventeenth century, has been published by Vish\u1e47u Parashur\u0101m \u015a\u0101str\u012b P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dit, with the poet\u2019s biography in English by Jan\u0101rdan Sakh\u0101r\u0101m G\u0101dg\u012bl.\n\nTo Professor A. Weber we are indebted for an important contribution to our knowledge of Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit literature in a Romanized edition of H\u0101la\u2019s Saptasatakam, a collection of miscellaneous Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit stanzas, with a German translation and an exhaustive introduction on the phonetic and grammatical condition of the language; the work is printed in the Abhandlungen, or Memoirs, of the German Oriental Society.\n\nAs regards the cultivation of the classical language and literature of the Hindus, the members of the Society are probably aware from last year\u2019s Report that, owing to an increased governmental grant to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the publication of Sanskrit (and Persian) texts in the Bibliotheca Indica had been resumed with renewed vigour. It is a matter for rejoicing to Orientalists in Europe that this commendable zeal has by no means slackened during the last twelvemonth, as will be seen from the following list of publications which have appeared in the course of the year. B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra has issued Nos. 23 and 24 of his edition of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and the 9th fasciculi of the \u0100ranyakas of the black Yajurveda, both with S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s commentary. Of the T\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, with S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s comment, parts 4 to 14, and of the L\u0101ty\u0101yana \u015arautas\u016btra with Agnisv\u0101min\u2019s Bh\u0101shya, parts 1 to 8, have appeared, both of which works are edited by \u0100nandachandra Ved\u0101ntav\u0101gi\u1e63a; also three fasciculi of the Agnipur\u0101\u1e47a, edited by Harachandra Vidy\u0101bh\u016bsha\u1e47a, and the 10th part of the Mim\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 Dar\u015bana, with \u015aabarasa\u1e43v\u0101min\u2019s comment, edited by P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dita Mahe\u1e63a-\nchandra Ny\u0101yaratna. The Gop\u0101la T\u0101pani, with Vi\u1e63ve\u015bvara\u2019s comment, has been edited by Harachandra Vidy\u0101bh\u016bshana and Vi\u1e63van\u0101tha \u015a\u0101str\u012b. Besides, the first part has appeared of the S\u0101maveda Sanhit\u0101, with S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s comment, edited by Satyavrata S\u0101ma\u1e63rami; the Gopatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, edited by Harachandra Vidy\u0101bh\u016bshana; the N\u1e5bisinha T\u0101pani, with \u015aankar\u0101ch\u0101rya\u2019s commentary, edited by R\u0101manaya Tarakaratna, and of an English translation, by the Rev. K. M. Banerjea, of the Brahmas\u016btra, with \u015aankara\u2019s comment.\n\nIn the Bombay Sanskrit Series, conducted by Professors B\u00fchler and Kielhorn, have been issued, by the latter, the second number of his Paribh\u0101shendu\u1e63ekhara by N\u0101gojibha\u1e6d\u1e6da, containing the first part of the translation and notes; and, by Shankar P. Pandit, an annotated edition of K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s M\u0101lavik\u0101gnimitra. Dr. Kielhorn has also published a Sanskrit Grammar for the use of the students at the Bombay and Poona Colleges. Dr. B\u00fchler, on the other hand, has issued, jointly with Mr. R. West, the second volume of their Digest of Hindu Law, and is at present engaged in preparing for publication, in the Sanskrit Series, a new and critical edition of the Da\u015bakum\u0101racharita.\n\nAmong editions of Sanskrit texts privately published by natives, the number of which rapidly increases year by year, though but a part of them reach Europe, the series of volumes issued by B\u0101b\u016b Barad\u0101 Pras\u0101da Majumd\u0101ra may deserve notice, including, during last year, Bhavabh\u016bti\u2019s Uitarar\u0101ma-charita, with a commentary by T\u0101r\u0101 Kum\u0101ra-chakravart\u012b; the Mudr\u0101r\u0101kshasa, edited by T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101tha Tarkav\u0101chaspati; the Ve\u1e47i\u1e63anah\u0101ra, and second editions of K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s Raghuva\u1e43\u015ba and Kum\u0101rasambhava, with Mallin\u0101tha\u2019s commentaries. Pandit T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101tha Tarkav\u0101chaspati has issued the Vish\u1e47upur\u0101\u1e47a, with commentary, and a Bengali translation; the M\u0101l\u0101vik\u0101gnimitra; Gang\u0101d\u0101sa\u2019s Chandomanjar\u012b and Kedarabha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s V\u1e5bttaratn\u0101kara; vol. i. of the second edition of the Siddh\u0101ntakaumud\u012b, and the fourth and concluding part\nof his Sanskrit-English Dictionary, entitled *Sabdastomamah\u0101nidhi*. Of other works which have come to the notice of the Council, editions may be mentioned of the *Sabden-du\u1e63ekhara*, with Bhairavami\u015bra\u2019s commentary, printed at Benares; the *Bh\u0101garatapur\u0101\u1e47a*, with Sudhara\u2019s commentary, at Bombay; the *Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101rya*, with Jayamangala\u2019s and Bharatamallika\u2019s commentaries, at Calcutta; the *Muh\u016brtachint\u0101mani*, with commentary, at Lucknow; and the first part of Charaka\u2019s famous medical work, on which some valuable remarks are made in a paper read before the Bengal Society, by Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar (Proceedings, 1870, p. 284).\n\nAt Madras also the presses have been busy in producing and reproducing Sanskrit works, though unfortunately in the Telugu character. It may be sufficient to mention editions of the *Tarkasamgraha* with Pa\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101bhir\u0101ma\u2019s commentary, called Ny\u0101yabodhin\u012b; the *Ved\u0101ntas\u016btra* with R\u0101m\u0101nuja\u2019s Ved\u0101ntad\u012bpa; the \u0100tmabodha\u015b\u0101stra; Mur\u0101ri\u2019s An\u0101ghan\u0101\u1e6daka, and the *Da\u015bopanishad*.\n\nSide by side with this multiplication of printed literature\u2014a strong proof of the ever-growing demand for books among the natives of India, and, we trust, of an ever-increasing desire for acquaintance with the standard works of their ancient literature\u2014the search for manuscripts has been carried on with laudable energy in some parts of India. The Council were able to state in their last report that, in accordance with the scheme proposed by Mr. Whitley Stokes, and adopted by the Government of India, lists of MSS. had been printed at Benares, Calcutta, Bombay, and in Mysore. It will be satisfactory to the Society to learn that B\u0101b\u016b R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra, to whom the task of examining MSS. discovered in the Bengal Presidency had been intrusted, has since issued two fasciculi containing notices, including the beginnings and conclusions, of about 360 Sanskrit MSS. A list of 108 MSS. purchased for the Bombay Government during the years 1867-69, has also been printed by Prof. G. B\u00fchler, in Messrs.\nTr\u00fcbner's American and Oriental Record for November, 1870; and last, not least, Mr. A. Burnell has, through the same medium, completed his catalogue of Vedic MSS., forming part of that valuable collection which he last year so generously made over to the India Office Library. The same scholar has just been appointed by the Madras Government to compile a catalogue of the important manuscript collection of Tangore, which is reported by him to contain about 18,000 MSS.\n\nIn Europe Sanskrit studies have by no means been neglected during the past year. Dr. John Muir, with unwearied perseverance, has issued the fifth volume of his Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India, consisting of a series of papers contributed to the Society's Journal for 1864-6, and bearing mostly on Vedic theogony, mythology, and religious belief; with addition of a good deal of fresh materials, and a new essay on the life and manners during the Vedic age. Professor A. Weber has published, in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Berlin, a German translation of the second book of the Atharvaveda, and an essay on the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, the purport of which is to show that there is a connexion between the leading story of that epic,\u2014the rape of S\u012bt\u0101 and R\u0101ma's expedition to Lank\u0101 or Ceylon\u2014and the Trojan legend as it underlies Homer's Iliad. To last year's Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 393), the same scholar has contributed supplementary remarks to a former paper on the Jyotirvid\u0101bhara\u1e47am, an astronomical work assigned to K\u0101lid\u0101sa, though probably a different author from the well-known poet.\n\nProfessor W. D. Whitney, of Yale College, has furnished in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, the second and concluding part of his edition of the Taittir\u012bya Pr\u0101ti\u1e63\u0101khya, with its commentary, the Tribh\u0101shyaratna, a translation, notes and excellent indices.\n\nTo Professor A. Ludwig, of Prague, we are indebted for a\nvolume on the Vedic Infinitive, containing a great deal of valuable grammatical matter, which would have been still more acceptable had the compiler added a translation to the vast number of passages quoted from the Veda, as by that means scholars would have been enabled more easily to verify his grammatical inferences.\n\nDr. G. Thibaut has published a short Sanskrit text, entitled Ja\u1e6d\u0101pa\u1e6dala treating of the Ja\u1e6d\u0101p\u0101\u1e6dha, a particular mode of reciting the hymns of the Vedas; to which he has added a German translation and annotations.\n\nDr. H. Pischel, in a Latin dissertation, De K\u0101lid\u0101sae \u015a\u0101kuntali recensionibus, has attempted to show, in a very able, if not entirely convincing, way, that of the so-called Beng\u0101li and Devan\u0101gar\u012b recensions, the two hitherto known versions of K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s drama \u015a\u0101kuntalam, the former is the more ancient and genuine. It is, however, to be feared that to decide this knotty question, Dr. Pischel had hardly sufficient materials at his command, though he has, no doubt, deserved well in again mooting the subject, and thus urging its final settlement.\n\nOf Professors B\u00f6htlingk and Roth\u2019s Sanskrit Dictionary, published at St. Petersburg, two more numbers, viz., 43 and 44, have been received during the last year, carrying the work on to the middle of the letter V., after the completion of which four more letters remain to be gone through.\n\nA few more translations of Sanskrit works deserve mentioning. Professor H. Kern has carried on, in the pages of the Society\u2019s Journal, his critical translation of Var\u0101ha-mihira\u2019s Astrological work, the Brhat-Sa\u1e45hit\u0101. Mr. R. T. H. Griffith has supplied us with a beautiful and pretty close English translation, in octosyllabic rhymed verse, of V\u0101lm\u012bki\u2019s great epic, the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. Of Dr. F. Hall\u2019s second edition of Wilson\u2019s version of the Vish\u1e47u-Pur\u0101\u1e47a the fifth and last volume has been issued. Mr. E. Brandes, a Danish scholar, following in the wake of Hammerich, who,\nin 1845, published the \u015a\u0101kuntala in Danish (of which a second edition appeared in 1858), has printed a neat Danish translation of King \u015a\u016bdraka's interesting drama, the M\u1e5bich-chhaka\u1e6dik\u0101 of which an English translation was published by the late Professor Wilson in his Hindu Theatre, and a critical edition by Professor Stenzler, of Breslau.\n\nThe field of Dravidian literature has found but few cultivators during the past year. Mr. C. E. Gover's lyrical translations from the Badaga, as read at these meetings, have been mentioned elsewhere. To Dr. H. F. M\u00f6gling, already favourably known by several Canarese publications, we are indebted for the first two chapters, in the Roman character, of Lakshmi\u1e63a's old Canarese rifaccimento of the A\u1e63vamedhaparva of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, the Jeimini Bh\u0101rata (Journal German Oriental Society, 1870, p. 309). The author had been placed by Wilson in the beginning of the thirteenth century. The reasons, however, adduced by Dr. M\u00f6gling, render it highly probable that he preceded Basava, who founded the Jangama sect, and broke the power of the Brahmans in that part of India, about A.D. 1000.\n\nAt Madras, the text of Bhaskara's Telugu version of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a has been printed; and Mr. P. S. R\u0101jagop\u0101la has published a second edition of his conversational manual in Tamil and English, with the text, analysis, and translation of forty stories from the Kad\u0101manjar\u012b. Mr. G. Garrett, Director of Public Instruction in Mysore, has published a manual of the ancient Canarese, entitled \u015aabdamanimanjar\u012b.\n\nAt Mangalore, a small Malay\u0101lim and English dictionary, and the fourth edition of the Panchatantra in Malay\u0101lim, with a glossary, have been issued.\n\nAs to the Literary Society of Madras, which in former times used to be the centre of Sanskrit and Dravidian studies in Southern India, the Council regret to have again to state that that branch of our Society has shown no sign of life during the past twelvemonth; and that, moreover, they have been\nofficially informed that, owing to want of encouragement on the part of the European residents, there is no prospect of the publication of its Journal being continued for some time.\n\nIn proceeding to take a rapid view of the labours in that Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit dialect which has become the chief depository of religious tenets that sway the minds of a very considerable portion of the population of Asia\u2014the P\u0101li\u2014it is highly gratifying to observe the steady increase of attention paid to so important a subject, especially in Ceylon, in Burmah, and throughout Europe. At the last anniversary the Council were able to state that, after some years of apparent inertness, the Ceylon branch of this Society had recommenced their operations with renewed vigour. These operations have been carried on ever since with decided success; that Society having published within the last fifteen months, three highly interesting numbers of its Journal. Among the articles they contain we may mention Mr. J. D\u2019Alwis\u2019s paper, \u201cOn the Origin of the Sinhalese Language,\u201d in which that writer shows the Sinhalese to be an \u0100ryan language; a lecture on Buddhism, by the late eminent P\u0101li scholar, the Rev. D. J. Gogerly, with an introduction by the Rev. J. Scott, and notes by the Rev. D. de Sylva; an account and partial English translation by the Rev. S. Coles, of the P\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101, or first book of the Vinaya portion of the Tripi\u1e6daka. Further, by Mr. L. F. Lee, five chapters of text and translation of the B\u0101l\u0101vat\u0101ra, a native P\u0101li grammar, of which that scholar intends to bring out a Romanized edition with an English translation; two inscriptions, about 350 years old, communicated, with translations and notes, by Mr. T. W. Rhys Davids; Specimens of Sinhalese Proverbs, by Mr. L. de Soyza, and a paper by Mr. W. Skeen, \u201cOn the Origin of the \u015ar\u012b-pada, or sacred Footprint, on the summit of Adam\u2019s Peak.\u201d\n\nIt will be remembered that the Government of Ceylon had lately resolved to have a catalogue compiled of all the P\u0101li MSS. known to exist in that island, and had appointed a\ncommission for examining places of arch\u00e6ological interest. Mr. D\u2019Alwis, who has been intrusted with the compilation of the catalogue, has nearly completed his first volume, which, it is to be hoped, will add considerably to our knowledge of the materials for P\u00e2li studies. Messrs. Rhys Davids and Smithers, on the other hand, had started, on behalf of the arch\u00e6ological commission, on an expedition to Tolomarua, which is reported to have been very successful, the ruins of several monasteries and a great many ancient inscriptions having been discovered. Considering how much of what is known of Indian history is due to Buddhist sources, and especially to those of Ceylon, the importance of an arch\u00e6ological survey of that island can scarcely be overrated, and it must, therefore, be satisfactory to the members of this Society to know that the lively interest taken in these researches by the present Governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, promises well for their hopes in that direction.\n\nAnother scheme, which had been conceived some years since, and is now being carried into effect, on the part of the Buddhist clergy of Ceylon, will prove of no less importance to P\u00e2li studies. It had been resolved that in every monastery the MSS. they possess of the Buddhist Canon should be carefully collated, and their variae lectiones noted in the best copy; and that, this having been effected, the MSS. containing the various readings should be sent up to a synod, when by their collation a critical and authorized text of the Tripi\u1e6daka would be obtained.\n\nAs regards Burmah, it is a matter for congratulation to P\u00e2li students, that no less a personage than the royal head of that country is the most zealous promoter of studies connected with Buddhism and P\u00e2li literature. His Majesty, being himself the author of a P\u00e2li grammar, is now said to have resolved to have the whole of the Buddhist Canon translated into English.\n\nThe P\u00e2li text of Kachch\u00e2yana\u2019s grammatical aphorisms has\nbeen issued, with annotations, by Dr. F. Mason, at Rangoon. This publication, though it has not satisfied European scholars, has, at all events, the merit of supplying, in a handy form, the whole of these important s\u016btras in probably as correct a text as is met with in an average Burmese MS.\n\nIn Germany, Dr. E. Kuhn, a young P\u0101li scholar already favourably known by a specimen of Kachch\u0101yana, containing the text and v\u1e5btta of the K\u0101raka, or third chapter on the construction of the cases, has lately taken another step in the right direction by an excellent edition of the N\u0101makappa, or second chapter of that grammar.\n\nIn France, M. Feer has contributed to the Journal Asiatique for May\u2013June, 1870, another instalment of his highly interesting and instructive \u00c9tudes Bouddhiques, including French translations from the P\u0101li and Tibetan, of the Dharmachakrapravartanam, the so-called Benares sermon, a chapter of the Buddhist scriptures.\n\nIn Russia, Mr. J. Minayeff has printed the text and Russian translation of the P\u0101timokkha, a collection of the Laws of the Buddhist Priesthood, of which translations by Messrs. Gogerly and Beal are found in vol. xix. of the Society\u2019s Journal. Mr. Minayeff has added some valuable extracts from the Arthakath\u0101s and from the Bhikkhun\u012b p\u0101timokkha (the chapter relating to nuns); although the language in which the notes are given\u2014his native tongue\u2014is, unfortunately, known to but a very limited number of students. The same scholar has published the Vuttodaya, a P\u0101li metrical treatise, founded on Sanskrit works of a similar nature.\n\nIn this country not less attention has been paid to P\u0101li and Buddhism. Our own Society has, through its Journal, placed before the public several important papers bearing on these subjects.\n\nThe second part of vol. iv. contained Mr. R. C. Childers\u2019s P\u0101li text, with a translation and critical notes, of the Khuddaka P\u0101\u1e6dha, one of the chapters of the Buddhist scriptures.\nTo the number published a few months since, Mr. V. Fausb\u00f6ll, the Danish scholar and editor of the Dhammapada, has contributed two J\u0101takas, or legends relating to former births of Buddha, in the original P\u0101li, with an English translation, critical notes, and some interesting remarks on the connexion of those fables with their Sanskrit versions, as found in the Panchatantra, Hitopade\u015ba and other works. Mr. Childers\u2019s paper on some passages of the Dhammapada relative to the question of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a has been mentioned before, as has been Mr. L. Comrilla Vijasimha\u2019s note on the origin of the Commentaries on the Buddhist Canon. There are, besides, some arch\u00e6ological papers bearing, either philologically or historically, on the same subject, viz., General Cunningham and Professor Dowson\u2019s Mathur\u0101 P\u0101li Inscriptions\u2014which have also been dealt with by B\u00e1b\u016b R\u0101jendra in the Journal of the Parent Society;\u2014Mr. S. Beal\u2019s lecture on the S\u0101nchi Tope, showing scenes and passages from the Vessantara J\u0101taka to be represented in some of the sculptures of that monument; and lastly, Mr. A. Wylie\u2019s paper on the Buddhist Inscription of Keu-yung kwan.\n\nCaptain T. Rogers has translated, from their Burmese version, the Parables contained in Buddhaghosha\u2019s commentary on the Dhammapada; to this Professor Max M\u00fcller has added a new translation of the Dhammapada and an elaborate introduction, in which he inquires into the authenticity of the traditional accounts regarding Buddhaghosha and the Arthakath\u0101s, and sets forth the importance of the Dhammapada for an exact comprehension of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, the Buddhist summum bonum.\n\nA want, however, which has long been felt, not only by P\u0101li scholars and Indianists in general, but also by the students of those languages which bear the mark of Buddhist thought impressed on them\u2014a P\u0101li dictionary\u2014is at last about to be supplied by Mr. R. C. Childers. This work, which is now printing, is to be issued in two parts; the\nRoman character being employed for the P\u0101li words, whilst the Devanag\u0101r\u012b is reserved for their Sanskrit equivalents.\n\nMr. H. Alabaster has issued a work on modern Buddhism in Siam, setting forth the views of an intelligent and enlightened Siamese on his own and other religions. Of this interesting book a second and greatly enlarged edition is already in preparation.\n\nA manual of Chinese-Buddhist terms and proper names has been published by the Rev. E. J. Eitel. Finally, much valuable matter, chiefly drawn from Chinese and Tibetan sources, is contained in Professor J. Summers's new periodical, the Ph\u0153nix.\n\nBefore passing to the various labours in the literatures of nations for whose chief development we have to look to the countries west of the Indus, it may not be inappropriate briefly to report on the progress made in historical and geographical research with regard to India. This important and fascinating field of inquiry has received more than usual attention at the hands of English scholars. Of Professor J. Dowson's edition of the late Sir H. M. Elliot's History of the Muhammedan Period of India, the third volume has appeared, carrying the work on from the death of N\u0101siru-d d\u012bn, in 1260 A.D., to the invasion of T\u012bm\u016br in 1398 A.D. The amount of materials from Persian historians here placed, for the first time, before the public in the garb of a European language, is very considerable, including, as it does, translations, by the Editor, of Z\u012b\u0101u-d d\u012bn Barn\u012b's and Shams-i Sir\u0101j 'Af\u012bf's works, both bearing the same title of T\u0101r\u012bkh-i F\u012broz Sh\u0101h\u012b; also of Sult\u0101n F\u012broz Sh\u0101h's Futuh\u0101t-i F\u012broz Sh\u0101h\u012b, and extracts from other works bearing on that period.\n\nMr. E. Thomas, in his \"Chronicles of the Path\u0101n Kings of Delhi,\" a portly volume grown out of his original monographs on the coinage of the Path\u0101n Sult\u0101ns and their Bengal neighbours, with addition of such materials as have\nsince been discovered, has admirably shown how much the sparks of light elicited by numismatic and general antiquarian research may contribute to illuminate dark spots in the history of Eastern nations. The period in the history of Hind\u00fbst\u00e2n illustrated in this work extends from A.D. 1192 to 1554, and comprises the rule of six dynasties of forty kings who succeeded in turn to the throne of Dehli.\n\nMr. Lepel H. Griffin's volume on the \"R\u00e2jas of the Punjab,\" furnishes a connected account, drawn from official records, of the political relations of the British Government with the principal states of the Punjab, from the commencement of the present century.\n\nTo Colonel Meadows Taylor students are indebted for a very useful manual of the history of India.\n\nOf the Central Provinces Gazetteer, published in 1867, Mr. C. Grant has brought out a second edition, which, however, may almost be considered as a new work. It now, for the first time, appears in the convenient alphabetical form usual in gazetteers; and, moreover, contains an introductory and highly interesting sketch of the history and ethnology as well as of the social and geological condition of those provinces.\n\nThe first volume of a \"Geography of India,\" published by General A. Cunningham, comprises the Buddhist period, extending from the time of Buddha to the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni. In following up his own former labours in the same field, as those of Lassen, Wilson, Saint-Martin, and others, the learned officer has thus placed before the public the results of his inquiries during a long residence in India, and particularly of a four years' successful service as Archaeological Surveyor, which must have especially qualified him to undertake so difficult a task.\n\nThe Society is no doubt aware that the Indian Government has lately instituted a General Archaeological Survey of the whole of India, and that General Cunningham has again\nbeen called upon to conduct the commission appointed for that purpose. Arriving in India at the beginning of the year, that officer, with his staff, has commenced operations by re-examining the ruins of Mathur\u00e2, and thence he has proceeded to Lahore, where he is at the present moment engaged in extensive excavations.\n\nFrom the Madras Government, an interesting report, by Mr. J. A. C. Boswell, \"On the Archaeological Remains of the Kistna District,\" has lately been received by the Society, and partially read at a recent meeting. The most important portions of this paper were the remarks made on the pre-Buddhist remains, consisting of aboriginal caves near Karsupudi, and sepulchral tumuli and stone circles, which he supposes to be of Scythic origin, and which closely resemble those in the Neilgherries.\n\nAt Bombay, Mr. Burgess and Dr. Bh\u00e2u D\u00e2ji have carried on their investigations, the latter having undertaken to revise the western Buddhist inscriptions, including that of Girn\u00e2r. In an interesting number lately issued by the Bombay branch of our Society, that scholar has given a facsimile, transcript and translation, of an inscription discovered by Mr. G. W. Terry in the temple of Amran\u00e2tha near Kaly\u00e2na. The same number contains some remarks, by Captain E. W. West, on the fort of Pan\u00e2la, and a paper, by R\u00e2o S\u00e2heb Vishvan\u00e2th N\u00e2r\u00e2y\u00e2n, on serpent worship in Western India. Finally, some papers of archaeological interest are contained in the Bengal Journal, including one by Mr. H. Blochmann on the Arabic and Persian Inscriptions in the H\u00fbgli District; notes on old Delhi, by Mr. J. D. Tremlett; on Archaeological Remains at Sh\u00e2h ki Dheri, and the site of Taxila, by Mr. J. G. Delmerick; and a memorandum on, and tentative reading of, the S\u00fbe Vih\u00e2r inscription near Bh\u00e2valp\u00fbr, by Mr. E. C. Bayley.\n\nIt may be convenient in this place to draw attention to a work on the language of a tribe which, though now scattered\nbroadcast over the earth, clearly derives its origin from the plains of India. Mr. A. G. Paspati, a Greek physician at Constantinople, had published, some ten years since, a work on the language of the Gipsies in Turkey, of which an English translation appeared in the seventh volume of the Journal of the American Oriental Society (1862).\n\nThe author has lately brought out a new, and French, edition of his work, which is very much enlarged, and altogether re-written. With reference to this book, Drs. A. Mordtmann and A. F. Pott have contributed a paper to the Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 681), containing some valuable additions and a few corrections.\n\nOur knowledge of the nature of the Pahlavi language has received a valuable addition in Professor M. Haug\u2019s Essay, forming part of the introduction to an old Pahlavi-P\u00e2zand glossary, edited under the auspices of the Bombay Government, by Destur Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa, high priest of the Parsis in Malwa. Dr. Haug\u2019s opinion is that the language of the Pahlavi version of the Avesta, when read, is an Iranian dialect, not materially differing from the modern Persian; whilst the written words, on the contrary, represent an Aramaic, or Semitic, dialect, with the exception, firstly, of certain Iranian prefixes and terminations, added to aid the memory in substituting the Iranian equivalents; and, secondly, of such Iranian words as, in time, may have crept in. Some remarks have been made on Dr. Haug\u2019s book, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 713), by Dr. E. Sachau, who, whilst rejecting many of the author\u2019s readings and etymologies, accepts his theories with regard to the origin and nature of the Pahlavi language.\n\nIn Professor F. Spiegel\u2019s \u201cIranian Antiquities,\u201d Oriental students will no doubt welcome an important contribution to Iranian research. This work, clearly taking as its prototype Lassen\u2019s \u201cIndian Antiquities,\u201d is to be published in three volumes, the first of which has already appeared, containing\nthe ethnographical account and ancient history of the Iranian tribes, and the geography of their seats.\n\nProfessor F. Justi, likewise, in a University Memorial, has given a second instalment of \"Contributions to the Ancient Geography of Persia.\"\n\nThe Persian publications in the Bibliotheca Indica, like the Sanskrit series, though not in the same degree, have been pushed on with more than usual vigour. Of Mr. H. Blochmann's excellent translation of Abul Fazl's \u0100in i Akbari, the supplementary volume of the same writer and politician's Akbar-n\u0101mah, the fourth part has been published, as have likewise the 11th and 12th fasciculi of his edition of the text. Parts 13 to 18 have also appeared of Kh\u0101fi Kh\u0101n's Muntakhab-al-Lub\u0101b, edited by Maulawi Kabir al-d\u012bn Ahmad; the first fasciculus of 'Abdar Rashid's Farhang i Rashidi, edited by Maulawi Zulfag\u0101r 'Al\u012b; further, three fasciculi of Muhammad S\u0101g\u012b Musta'idd Kh\u0101n's History of the Emperor Aurangzib Alamg\u012br, and two fasciculi of Niz\u0101mi's Sikandar-n\u0101mah i Bahri, both edited by Maulawi Agh\u0101 Ahmad 'Al\u012b.\n\nIn the Journal of the Bengal Society the late Major Fuller's translations from the T\u0101rikh-i Fir\u016bz Sh\u0101h\u012b are continued. Of native publications it may suffice to mention two small hand-books introductory to the study of the Persian language, printed at Lahore, by order of the Punjab Government, viz., the F\u0101rsi-ki-pahli-Kit\u0101b and the F\u0101rsi-ki-dusri-Kit\u0101b, the latter bring a kind of chrestomathy on a small scale, whilst the former contains easy sentences illustrating the grammatical construction and idioms of the language.\n\nProfessor J. A. Vullers has brought out a second, and much improved, edition (likewise written in Latin) of his Grammar of the Persian Language, as compared with the Sanskrit and Zend. The first edition of this work was published as long back as 1840, and has always been valued as a successful attempt at establishing an accurate appreciation of the extent of grammatical and phonetic coincidences\nof the Persian with Aryan languages, by one who combines, as few others do, a sufficient acquaintance with at least some of the latter with a sound Semitic scholarship.\n\nFer\u00eededdin Att\u00e2r\u2019s Pendn\u00e2meh, of which a French version exists, by M. de Sacy, has been translated into German by Dr. G. H. F. Nesselmann, already known by his translations from Sadi and Hafiz.\n\nAfter an interval of nearly twenty years, the late F. R\u00fcckert\u2019s text and poetical translation of Dsh\u00e2mi\u2019s love-songs have at last been continued in the Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 563), where also a short account of Mirza Shaff\u00ee has been given by Mr. A. Berg\u00e9.\n\nThe list of already existing Catalogues of Semitic MSS. has received some important additions during the last year. Foremost stands the first volume of the Catalogue of Syriac MSS. in the British Museum, compiled by Dr. W. Wright, and containing accounts of, and extracts from, the Biblical MSS. and Service Books of the Nitrian Collection. The second volume of this work, which is nearly ready for publication, will embody the rest of the theological literature. The same scholar has communicated in the German Oriental Society\u2019s Journal (p. 599) a list of the Magdala Collection of Ethiopic MSS., formerly forming part of the Library of King Theodore, of Abyssinia, now in the British Museum.\n\nOf Dr. Rieu\u2019s Catalogue of Persian MSS. of that institution, a large portion had been printed, when the sheets were unfortunately destroyed by the fire at Watts\u2019s printing-office; a mishap which has also delayed Mr. Lane\u2019s issuing the fourth part of his Arabic Dictionary.\n\nM. B. Dorn has printed in the Memoirs of the St. Petersburg Academy, a short Catalogue of a number of Oriental, mostly Persian, MSS., bequeathed to the Asiatic Museum of the Imperial Academy by the late M. Graf.\n\nFinally, Mr. E. H. Palmer has published a Catalogue of the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish MSS. at Trinity College,\nCambridge; with an Appendix containing the Hebrew and Samaritan MSS. of the same library.\n\nThe usual, not undeserved, amount of zealous attention has been bestowed on the cultivation of Arabic literature, especially on the Continent. Professor F. W\u00fcstenfeld's complete edition of Yak\u00fbt's important Geographical Dictionary of all Countries known to the Arabs in his days, has been followed up by another publication on Geography. M. de Goeje, of Leiden, has issued the first volume of a Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum, containing the work of Ish\u00e2k al-F\u00e2ris\u00ee al-Istakhri, hitherto but partly edited by Anderson and Arnold, and lithographed by Moeller. The volume now published is to be followed by two others containing the works of Ibn Haukal and Mokaddasi, when the collection is to be completed by a German translation, with indexes and a glossary.\n\nOf Ibn-El-Athiri's great Chronicle, edited by Professor C. J. Tornberg, of Upsala, another volume, the fifth, has been issued, comprising the years H. 96 to 154. It will be remembered that Mr. Tornberg began his edition by publishing vols. vi. to xii., which were followed, in rapid succession, by vols. i. to v.; thus, only one more volume, the sixth, is wanting to complete the work. Of Professor W. Wright's edition of that valuable, though curious, literary repertory, the K\u00e2mil of El-Mubarrad, brought out in annual parts, printed at the expense of the German Oriental Society, the seventh part has appeared during last year. The same scholar has supplied to Arabic students a very useful chrestomathy, containing some hitherto unpublished texts, with a glossary. Professor Ahlwardt, of Greifswald, has brought out a collective edition of the Div\u00e2ns of the six ancient Arabic poets, Enn\u00e2biga, 'Antara, Tarafa, Zuhair, 'Algama, and Imruolgais; and M. Von Kremer has given, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society (p. 481), an account and some poems, with a German translation, of the Shiite poet Abu-lk\u00e2\u015f\u00eem Mohamed\nIbn H\u00e2ni\u2019, who lived at the court of the F\u00e2t\u00eemite Mo\u2019izz, the conqueror of Egypt, in the tenth century. The Arabic version and a new German translation of the curious Neo-platonic tract of Hermes Trismegisthos, an \u201cAddress to the Human Soul,\u201d has been printed by Professor Fleischer, of Leipzig, in commemoration of the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the German Oriental Society, held in September last year.\n\nA work, however, of the highest importance to Oriental literary and philological studies, the Kit\u00e2b-al-Fihrist of Mu\u1e25ammad bin Ish\u00e2\u1e33 al Nad\u00eem, is now in an advanced state of publication. This work had been prepared for the press by the late eminent scholar and honorary member of our Society, Professor G. Fl\u00fcgel, when his labours were unfortunately cut short by a sudden death. The annotated text, however, is now being carried through the press by Dr. H. Roediger, and the first volume will probably be issued in the course of the summer. The latter scholar has also published some specimens from Arabic grammarians, including the well-known philologist Ab\u00fb Al\u00ee Alf\u00e2ris\u00ee, in connexion with a treatise on the so-called \u201cVerbal Nouns,\u201d in Arabic.\n\nDr. J. B. Wenig has written a Latin dissertation on Arabic accentuation; and delivered, and printed, a lecture on Arabic poetry.\n\nDr. M. Steinschneider has contributed to the Journal of the German Oriental Society, a second essay, \u201cOn the History of Translations from Indian Languages into Arabic, and their influence on Arabic Literature,\u201d chiefly based on accounts of Abraham Ibn Esra (who lived about A.D. 1160), occurring in the introduction to his Hebrew translation of an Arabic astronomical work.\n\nOne of the three numbers of the Journal Asiatique issued during last year, is almost entirely occupied by a paper on the Arabic names of some species of plants, by the late M. Cl\u00e9ment-Mullet.\n\nFinally, it may be mentioned in this place, that Lord\nStanley of Alderley has continued, in the Society's Journal, his edition, in the Morisco-Spanish, of the Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan, by four cantos, containing the history of Heshim, the great-grandfather of the Prophet.\n\nSyriac studies have also received some important contributions of hitherto unpublished texts. Dr. J. P. L. Land has brought out a third volume of his \"Anecdota Syriaca,\" containing the Syriac version of the historical writings which pass under the name of Zacharias, Bishop of Mityl\u00e8ne. That that worthy dignitary, who flourished in the early part of the sixth century of our era, did not himself write in Syriac, but in Greek, has been proved by Dr. Land many years since. The reasons he now adduces render it highly probable that of the twelve books published by him and generally assigned to Zacharias, five only, viz., books three to seven, are by that writer, whilst the rest have been compiled from various sources by the Syrian translators. Dr. E. Sachau also has published a volume of \"Inedita Syriaca,\" being a collection of Syriac translations of Greek profane writings, edited from MSS. in the British Museum. To the Journal of the German Oriental Society Dr. R. Schr\u00f6ter has contributed two articles on Syriac subjects, one containing extracts from Bar Hebraeus' scholia on the Old Testament; the other, a letter of Jacob, Bishop of Edessa, to one John the Stylite, Presbyter of Jatreb; both with a German translation and critical notes. The publication also of the Rev. Dr. Payne Smith's Syriac dictionary is now being carried on vigorously; two parts have already been issued, containing the first three letters of the alphabet.\n\nOf the Aramaic dialects, Dr. H. Zschokke has brought out a hand-book for the use of students; whilst Professor T. N\u00f6ldeke has contributed to the Journal of the German Oriental Society, as a third instalment of his Aramaic studies, a paper on the dialect of Palmyra. In the mean time, Dr. Socin, during his travels in Syria, has been collecting much\nlinguistic material on various modern dialects, and, from time to time, reported on the progress of his inquiries.\n\nThe lapidary remains of the Ph\u0153nician antiquity have received some valuable illustration by the publication of the fourth part of Dr. M. A. Levy's Ph\u0153nician studies; this number contains a survey of the labours in this department of research since 1863; besides separate chapters, full of fresh philological matter, on the inscriptions of Abydos, Sardinia, Spain and North Africa; and finally some additions to the author's Ph\u0153nician glossary. The inscription of Marseilles has again been made the subject of inquiry in the pages of the Journal Asiatique, by M. Hal\u00e9vi, who has ventured upon a new translation, based on a comparison of the text with the Hebrew, with the entire exclusion of the Arabic. Dr. J. Unger, on the other hand, has made some remarks in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, on the slabs both of Carthage and Marseilles, with especial reference to Dr. Meier's explanation of these documents.\n\nAn event, however, of the highest importance to Semitic pal\u00e6ography, as well as to ancient history, is no doubt the discovery of the Dibon monolith, which has been only lately discussed at a meeting of our Society. In spite of its importance, it would hardly seem necessary for the Council here to enlarge on a subject which has already received its full due, if not more than its due, of attention at the hands of so many scholars.\n\nThe number of Himyaric antiquities discovered in Yemen is increasing almost daily. Captain Miles's valuable donation to this Society has been mentioned before. The two bronze tablets, noticed in last year's Report as likewise presented by that officer, have since found an interpreter, together with a considerable number of other Himyaric inscriptions, in Dr. M. A. Levy, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, where, at the same time, lithographs of them are given.\n\nThe British Museum, also, has from time to time been\nenriched by inscriptions and other antiquities, among which we may mention a newly-received stone, containing a beautifully cut $\\beta\\omega\\nu\\sigma\\tau\\rho\\phi\\eta\\delta\\omega\\nu$ inscription; also two copper tablets, which are said to constitute one inscription, together with the tablet which has lately come into our possession.\n\nAn Himyaric monument of probably a somewhat similar purpose to the sculptured alabaster slab lately presented by Captain Miles, has been treated in the Journal Asiatique, for 1870, by M. Clermont-Ganneau, who takes it to represent a sacrifice to 'Athtar, the deity invoked on the slab. Some remarks on the same monument, though from more imperfect squeezes, have been made by Professor Gildemeister, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society for 1870 (p. 178).\n\nSome progress has also been made during last year in the field of Cuneiform Researches. Of Mr. E. Norris's Assyrian Dictionary, the second volume has been published, whilst a considerable portion of the third volume has already passed through the press. It must be the sincere wish of all Orientalists that so zealous and able a fellow-labourer may yet enjoy many years of health and vigour to see his work completed.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson has lately added a vast amount of fresh material by issuing, with the assistance of Mr. G. Smith, another volume containing, on seventy folio plates, selections from the Miscellaneous Inscriptions of Assyria. Among these may be mentioned the Assyrian Canon, consisting of chronological tables supplying a continuous succession of eponymes for 228 years (from B.C. 893 to 660), an inscription on a monolith found in the ruins of Kurkh, relating the campaigns of the earlier years of the reign of Shalmeneser II.; a copy of the inscription of Sennacherib on the rock at Bavian; the text of the Decagon Cylinder of Assur-bani-pal, and various miscellaneous historical inscriptions, besides copies of several contracts, deeds, observatory reports, astrological and mythological fragments.\nMr. G. Smith has, meanwhile, been steadily pursuing his labours at the Annals of Sardanapalus. A further contribution to Assyrian philology is also promised by Mr. F. Talbot for the next number of the Society's Journal.\n\nThe so-called Median Cuneiforms, on the other hand, have received some illustrations in a paper by Dr. A. Mordtmann, in the Journal of the German Oriental Society.\n\nThe language of the other principal branch of Muhammadan races\u2014the Turks\u2014has not been neglected.\n\nM. de Schlechta-Wssehrd has published a useful French and Turkish manual of terms and phrases used principally in diplomatic documents.\n\nTo M. Paret de Courteille we are indebted for an East Turkish Dictionary, an important addition to the labours of Messrs. V\u00e9liaminof-Zernof and V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry.\n\nDr. Zenker, likewise, has been continuing his dictionary of the Turkish, Arabic, and Persian, by three more parts, viz., 14 to 16.\n\nThe various dialects and history of the Indian Archipelago have been, as usual, successfully cultivated in the Journals of the Dutch Institute and the Batavian Society, which contain several valuable philological contributions, the former by Messrs. H. Kern and H. C. Klinkert, the latter by Messrs. J. G. F. Riedel and H. N. van der Tunk. The Batavian Society having, in the course of last year, issued a number of well-executed typographic impressions of Kawi copper-plate inscriptions, this important field of inquiry, which had so long been allowed to lie fallow, has at length been successfully taken up by Prof. H. Kern, of Leiden. This scholar has just published a volume of Kawi Studies, containing two cantos of the text of the Arjuna Viv\u0101ha in the ancient Javanese, with a Dutch translation, notes, and an introduction. The Dutch Institute has further printed M. T. Roorda's Javanese text of the Wayangs of Palasara, Pandoe, and Raden Pandji, and the first volume of a Malayan\nChrestomathy by M. G. K. Niemann. It remains briefly to mention the latest publications on Chinese and Japanese literature and philology. Mr. J. Summers's Monthly Magazine, the Ph\u0153nix, of which ten numbers have as yet been issued, will, no doubt, prove a useful repository to scholars interested in these inquiries, containing, as it does, numerous and valuable essays on the literature, history, and religion of the peoples of Eastern Asia. The Memoirs of the Munich and Vienna Academies also contain, as usual, contributions on the same subjects, by Messrs. Plath and Pfizmayer. Dr. V. Strauss has published a new German translation of Lao-Tse's Tao Te King, with a comment and an introduction. Mr. A. B. Mitford, in his Tales of Old Japan, a book at the same time instructive and amusing, makes us acquainted with the legendary lore as well as the domestic life and manners of the Japanese. Whilst grammatical inquiry has been promoted by one publication only, the second volume of M. St. Julien's Syntaxe nouvelle de la langue Chinoise, Chinese lexicography has received more than usual attention during last year. The Revds. R. S. Maclay and C. C. Baldwin have supplied an alphabetical dictionary of the Chinese language in the Foochow dialect; the Rev. W. Lobscheid, a Chinese and English Dictionary, arranged according to the radicals; Rev. J. Eldkins, a Glossary of the Miau dialects; Mr. F. Porter Smith, a vocabulary of proper names in Chinese and English; and M. Paul Perny, a Dictionary in French, Latin, and Chinese, of the Mandarin dialect.\n\nIn concluding these remarks, we may mention that Mr. J. Summers is now engaged in compiling a new catalogue of the Society's important collection of Chinese printed books, as well as of that of the India Office Library.\n\nIt will be incumbent on this meeting to elect a new president for the ensuing year, in the place of one whose constant attendance at the Society's meetings, and deep\nattachment to Oriental research, in which he occupies himself so prominent a place, have lasting claims on the gratitude of this Society. Sir Henry having intimated to the Council that his duties at the India Office and the Geographical Society would not permit him for another year to combine the office of a President with that of a Director of this Society, Sir Edward Colebrooke has kindly allowed himself to be put in nomination for the former office, and the Council feel assured that the warm interest Sir Edward has always taken in the objects of this Society, coupled with that very name which marks one of the most glorious epochs in its history, will strongly recommend him to the meeting.\n\nAccording to Art. XXI. of the Society\u2019s regulations, the following five members of the Council will go out: General Cunningham, the Rt. Hon. Lord Lawrence, E. L. Brandreth, Esq., James Fergusson, Esq., and Sir H. Bartle E. Frere. In their places, the Council propose to the meeting the following names: Sir Donald F. McLeod, the Rt. Hon. Lord Stanley of Alderley, Prof. T. Goldst\u00fccker, N. B. E. Baillie, Esq., and the Rt. Hon. Holt Mackenzie. In the place of the last-named gentleman and Sir Edward Colebrooke, the Council recommend Sir H. Bartle E. Frere, and Mr. J. Fergusson for the two vacancies in the list of vice-presidents.\n\nAUDITORS\u2019 REPORT.\n\nYour Auditors, having examined the accounts of the past year, and compared them with the vouchers, find them correct. They have also formed a careful estimate of the income and expenditure for the ensuing year, and anticipate that the income will suffice to meet the expected demands on the Society\u2019s resources without trenching on the balance in the bankers\u2019 hands at the beginning of the year.\n\nJames Fergusson, Auditor for the Council.\nNeil B. E. Baillie,\nHenry Lewis, Auditors for the Society.\nThe reading of the Report being concluded, it was proposed by Sir John Bowring, seconded by Major-General G. Le Grand Jacob, and carried unanimously:\n\n\"That the Report of the Council and of the Auditors be adopted, printed, and distributed, and that the best thanks of the meeting be presented to Sir Henry Rawlinson for his constant attention to the affairs of the Society, and his unwearied exertions to promote its interests; and to the Vice-Presidents, Council, and other Officers of the Society, for the zealous and efficient manner in which they have discharged the duties of their several offices.\"\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson, after returning thanks for the flattering terms in which his services had been mentioned in Sir John's proposition, said:\n\nThe very able and exhaustive Report which has just been read to you, and for which we are mainly indebted to the industry and critical knowledge of our Secretary, leaves me really nothing further to say on the subject of the prosecution of Oriental studies in the East or in the West.\n\nThe long list of recent works and papers which the Secretary has enumerated in every department of Oriental learning testifies to the increased and ever-increasing interest which is felt in the cultivation of those studies for which this Society was specially instituted; and shows, moreover, that we have borne our due part in the healthy activity that surrounds us. I have sometimes heard murmurs of regret that our prosperity diminishes\u2014that our resources and means of usefulness become attenuated\u2014by the creation of the many subsidiary societies that have arisen, if not under our auspices, at any rate in a great measure from the impulse and encouragement we have given to Oriental studies. I allude to such bodies as the Syro-Egyptian Society, the Palestine Exploration Fund, and more recently the Society of Biblical Archaeology\u2014all of which, according to the views of many, ought to be merely sub-departments\nof the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain: but I cannot for my own part find it in my heart to complain of such independent action in special branches of inquiry. As the mother-country benefits by her colonies scattered over the different quarters of the globe, so must this parent Society benefit by the creation of fresh centres of interest in the great domain of Oriental Science. For a time possibly our finances may suffer, owing to the diversion of subscriptions into other channels; but in the long run we shall right ourselves, even financially, if we only hold our literary position at the head of the Orientalism of England. The more indeed that a knowledge of Eastern languages and Eastern science is diffused amongst the public, the better it must be for that body of which the true and the noble vocation is to guide and encourage and preside over all such researches for the general good.\n\nIt is a matter of much regret to me that the many heavy calls upon my time\u2014and especially the direction which is about to be confided to me of one of our most flourishing sister societies\u2014compels me to surrender into your hands before my time of office is complete, the Presidency of this Society, which you were good enough to entrust to me in 1869; but I have at any rate the satisfaction of knowing that I resign my functions into most worthy and most thoroughly competent hands. The name of Colebrooke is in itself a tower of strength\u2014and Sir E. Colebrooke has already on former occasions shown you that he does not yield to his illustrious father either in his own earnest interest in Oriental science, or in his anxiety to promote its cultivation. I feel sure, gentlemen, that the Society will not derogate from its high position while the Presidency remains in his hands, but that he will lead you on to increased honour, numbers, and usefulness.\n\nThe Ballot was then had recourse to, for the election of a\nPresident, two Vice-Presidents, and five members of Council, when the result was declared to be as follows:\n\nPresident: Sir Thomas Edward Colebrooke, Bart., M.P.\n\nDirector: Major-Gen. Sir H. C. Rawlinson, K.C.B., D.C.L., F.R.S.\n\nVice-Presidents: The Right Hon. Sir Edward Ryan; M. E. Grant Duff, Esq., M.P.; Sir H. Bartle E. Frere, G.C.S.I., K.C.B.; James Fergusson, Esq., F.R.S., D.C.L.\n\nTreasurer: Edward Thomas, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nHonorary Secretary: Professor Thomas Chenery.\n\nHonorary Librarian: Edwin Norris, Esq.\n\nSecretary: J. Eggeling, Esq.\n\nCouncil: N. B. E. Baillie, Esq.; C. P. Brown, Esq.; Dr. Archibald Campbell; John Dickinson, Esq.; M. P. Edgeworth, Esq.; Claude J. Erskine, Esq.; W. E. Frere, Esq.; Prof. T. Goldst\u00fccker; Arthur Grote, Esq.; Charles Horne, Esq.; The Right Hon. Holt Mackenzie; Sir Donald F. McLeod; Sir Charles Nicholson, Bart.; Osmond de Beauvoir Priaulx, Esq.; The Right Hon. Lord Stanley of Alderley.\n\nSir H. Rawlinson having vacated the chair for the new President, Sir Edward Colebrooke addressed the Meeting, as follows:\n\nGentlemen,\u2014My first duty in acknowledging the honour you have done me, in inviting me to preside over this Society, is to express the regret which I feel, in common with all the members of this Society, at the premature retirement of Sir H. Rawlinson from the chair which he has occupied, with so much dignity and advantage to the Society, during the past two years. We must admit that the invitation which has been made to him to preside over one of the most active and popular associations in this metropolis, is one to which he is fully entitled from his labours in advancing our knowledge of ancient geography, and in promoting modern discovery. It involved demands on the time which may well make one, whose time is so largely occupied\nby official duties, unwilling to join with it the position of President of the Royal Asiatic Society. It is not the less a matter of regret to us, that we shall lose the advantage which the reputation and ability of one of the most learned contributors to our proceedings have given to the Society, during the time he has occupied the chair. For myself, I feel that the honour which you have conferred upon me, both on the present and on a former occasion, is due to the inheritance of a name which holds a foremost place in the respect of all Eastern scholars, and is intimately associated with the foundation of this Society. It adds much to the difficulty I feel in taking the chair, that I have such an example before me; and I should certainly have shrunk from a position to which I have, personally, no claim, did I not rely on the support of former colleagues, and carry with me the recollection of the aid I have received from your learned Director, in my endeavour to discharge the duties you have imposed upon me.\n\nI may at the same time say that the work on which I have been recently engaged of endeavouring to give a somewhat full account of the life and varied labours of Mr. H. Colebrooke, labours which you are aware extended to many fields beyond the range of Oriental research, has led me to examine more carefully than I had hitherto done some of the subjects of inquiry connected with the ancient literature of India, to which so much of his time was devoted; and this has added largely to the interest I feel in the progress of these researches. His aim, I need hardly say, like that of his successor, was to throw some light on one of the most interesting as well as obscure passages in the history of the world. It was not merely to arrive at some distinct knowledge of the state of the arts, science, and literature of ancient India, and in age far removed from our own, but to trace the rise and progress of the religious and philosophical opinions which have prevailed from time to time;\nsome of which maintain their influence on the manners and modes of thought which exist in those countries in the present day. The field is a wide one; it is one in which we look for the aid of kindred societies now established in considerable numbers both in the East and West, and we are enabled to pursue these inquiries under advantages which the pioneers of these studies did not possess.\n\nIt is a task to which we are more than ever impelled from a feeling of duty towards the inhabitants of a vast country, so strongly united by political ties with our own. It may be not unreasonable to hope that the knowledge thus acquired of the former history and condition of these countries may have some practical influence on its present condition, and may aid in solving some questions bearing on its future political and social life. But for this we must trust to the labours and co-operation of learned natives of India, many of whom, we rejoice to know, are warmly interested in researches whose sole aim is to arrive at an accurate knowledge of the former life of the nation, as it is shown in the different branches of its literature or science.\n\nI trust that the Royal Asiatic Society will continue to take a full share in these inquiries, and that the efforts of its members may add to its reputation and bear fruits in the well-being of the people of India.\n\nThe Meeting was then adjourned to June 19th.\n### Abstract of Receipts and Expenditure for the Year 1870\n\n#### Receipts\n\n| Description                                      | \u00a3  s. d. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 130 Resident Members, at 3 guineas each           | 409 10 0 |\n| 61 Non-Resident Members, at 1 guinea each         | 64 1 0   |\n| 3 Original Members, at 2 guineas each             | 6 6 0    |\n| Arrears paid up                                   | 12 12 0  |\n| Compositions:                                     |          |\n| Thakur Gorparshad Singh                           | 10 10 0  |\n| Rajah Jaikishan Dass Bahadur                      | 10 10 0  |\n| S.
