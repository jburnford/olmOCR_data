BEVERIDGE, Esq., C.S., President, in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\n\nB\u00e1bu Nobin Chandra Bur\u00e1l, B\u00e1bu Gaurd\u00e1s Bysack, B\u00e1bu Sarat-chandra D\u00e1s, P. Donaldson, Esq., Maulv\u00ed Gol\u00e1m Sarwar, B\u00e1bu Jogen-drachandra Ghose, B\u00e1bu Rajanik\u00e1nta Gupta, F. G. Hickson, Esq., Dr. W. King, C. J. Lyall, Esq., R. D. Mehta, Esq., B\u00e1bu Asutosh Mukho-p\u00e1dhy\u00e1y, T. R. Munro, Esq., A. Pedler, Esq., Dr. D. Prain, W. L. Sclater, Esq., Pandit Harapras\u00e1d Sh\u00e1stri.\n\nThe Minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nForty presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen are candidates for election at the next meeting:\n\nHon. Lala Bunbehari Kuppur, Manager, Burdwan Raj, proposed by H. Beveridge, Esq., seconded by Asutosh Mukerjee.\n\nDuncan J. Macpherson, Esq., C.S., proposed by Babu Harapras\u00e1d Sh\u00e1stri, seconded by Dr. Crombie.\n\nThe following gentlemen have expressed their wish to withdraw from the Society:\n\nF. S. Growse, Esq., C.S.\nA. O. Hume, Esq., C.S.\nThe President announced that Lieut. Pealey had kindly presented to the Society the old gun containing an inscription recently dug up at False Point, a description of which was published in the Proceedings for May 1890, together with the carriage on which it has been recently mounted. The gun has been placed in the Society's grounds on the west side of the building.\n\nThe Secretary read a letter from the Government of Bengal conveying approval to the manner in which the Government grants-in-aid of the Oriental Publication Fund, and the Sanskrit Manuscript Fund were applied during the year 1889.\n\nThe President read a translation of a Samad said to have been granted by Akbar to Heer Bijoy Suri, an Achari of the Jains, the Girnar, Mount Abu, Parismath, &c. It was dated 7th Ardhi Bhishma or Rabi-al-awal of the 37th year of the reign (1563). The President said that he offered no opinion about the genuineness of the document, but it certainly was in Akbar's style, as recorded by Abdul Faizl. The Samad has been produced in the case about Parismath which is now pending on appeal before the High Court. It is said to have been first produced about 1867. The President had thought it right to notice the document because, if genuine, it was a very interesting one, and it might be lost sight of if not now referred to. Professor B\u00fchler's paper in the Epigraphia Indica, Part VI, p. 321, shows Akbar's inclination towards Jainism. He is there said to have granted a firman to Jivachandra Suri.\n\nThe President exhibited rubbings of an inscription of Ghirisa-din Balban 'A. H. 684\u2014686, A. D., 1285\u20141287). The inscription, which consists of four lines in relief, originally stood over the gateway of a dismantled fort at Manglaur in the Saharanpur district, N.W. P., and is now placed in the Khangah of Mahomed Shah Waliyal at the same place. Manglaur is the chief town of the pargana of the same name, distant 6 miles due south from Barzi, and 16 miles south-east from Saharanpur. It is chiefly inhabited by Muhammadan jajilas (weavers), and is a poor place, having suffered much from fever since the water-level of the country was raised by the Ganges Canal. An imperfect copy of the inscription was sent by Mr. W. Irvine, C. S., Magistrate of the District, in February 1887, and the rubbings now produced were subsequently obtained by Dr. Hoernle.\n\nThe inscription is imperfect, and therefore difficult to read and\n\n* This account has been kindly drawn up by Mr. C. J. Lyall, C. I. E.\ntranslate. The initial portion of each of the four lines, which no doubt occupied a slab to the right, is wanting, and something also appears deficient at the end of the third line. The following is the text:\n\n(1.) \"The mighty Shahanshah Ghiy\u0101\u1e63u-d-duny\u0101 wa-d-d\u012bn, father of the Victorious\n\n(2.) [May God perpetuate his glory] and his rule: in the time of the governorship of the King of the Kings of the East and China\n\n(3.) * * * (May his lofty dignity be eternal!) the Shahanshah gave the order for (the erection of) this secure building\n\n(4.) On the tenth of the silent month of God, Rajab, in the year 683.\"\n\nOnly two other inscriptions of Balban have yet been described. One is on the walls of the J\u0101mi\u2019 Masjid at Garhmuktesar in the Mer\u0101\u1e6dh district, and is dated 682. Its text will be found at p. 136 of Mr. E. Thomas\u2019s \u201cPath\u00e1n Kings of Delhi.\u201d In it the king is styled\n\nThe other is the inscription on the Min\u0101r of Koil (now preserved in the Aligarh Institute, N.-W. P.) of which a facsimile and reading are given at p. 129 of the same work. The translation of a more correct reading, furnished by Mr. Blochmann, will be found at p. 486 of the late Mr. E. T. Atkinson\u2019s Statistical Account of the Aligarh District (Vol. II of his \u201cStatistical, Descriptive and Historical Account of the N.-W. Provinces of India.\u201d) The latter, which is dated 10th Rajab 652, was set up during the reign of the preceding king, N\u0101\u1e63iru-d-d\u012bn Mahm\u016bd, whose minister and brother-in-law Balban was. The Aligarh inscription also contains the curious expression, applied therein to Balban though he was then only the king\u2019s deputy (N\u0101ibu-s-saltanah), \u201cmaliku mul\u016bki-sh-sharqi wa-s-S\u012bn\u201d\u2014\u201cKing of the kings of the East and of China\u201d\u2014which occurs in the second line of the Manglaur inscription.* In the latter it probably also refers, as is indicated by the words\n\n* This expression is used by the Arabic historians and geographers with reference to Alexander\u2019s conquests in Asia; see, e.g., Kazv\u012bni\u2019s geography (ed. W\u00fcstenfeld) s. v. Her\u0101t. It amounts, therefore, in an inscription like the present, to a description of the person named as \u201cthe Alexander of his age.\u201d\nto a Deputy, not the king himself\u2014perhaps to his much-loved eldest son Mu\u1e25ammad Sult\u0101n, called Kh\u0101n-i-Shah\u012bd, who fell fighting against the Mughals at Lahor in the following year 684. This prince was Governor of Mult\u0101n during the later years of his life, but exercised authority over the whole of the western portion of the Empire during Balban's absence in Bengal in the operations against Tughrul Kh\u0101n.\n\nThe word of which a fragment occurs at the beginning of the second line may be either \u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647 or \u0645\u0644\u06a9\u0647. The commencement of the third line is not legible without a knowledge of what comes before. The group of letters may be \u062f\u0645 \u0641\u0645 instead of as printed above. The construction of the \u0627\u0645\u0631 is faulty; we should expect \u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u0641 instead of \u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u0641. It is perhaps a mistake of the stone-cutter for \u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u0641, but the dot of the \u0646 is clear. \u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0647, as a participial adjective with a passive signification of the form \u0646\u0628\u06cc\u0644, may be appended in the masculine form to a feminine noun. The word \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0646\u0634\u0627\u062f is doubtful. The \u0621, which is placed above the second \u0633, looks more like \u0644, which, however, gives no sense. Neither of the \u0633s is pointed, and the \u0621 seems to be written before instead of after the first \u0621. The word of which there is a fragment at the beginning of the fourth line is probably \u064a\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0644, only \u064a being visible. The name \u064a\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0644, \"the deaf and dumb,\" given to the sacred month of Rajab is an old epithet of Arabian paganism, indicating that in that month (which stands by itself alone in the midst of the Arabian year, the other three sacred months being consecutive) the noise of battle is never heard.\n\nThe alterations in the Rules which had been proposed by Council were brought up for discussion. A letter from R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra strongly objecting to the alterations was read, and then remarks were made by several members. Dr. W. King supported R\u0101j\u0101 R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra's objections, and Messrs. Mehta and Donaldson and B\u0101bus Asutosh Mukharjia, Gaurd\u0101s Bysack, Jogendrachunder Ghose, Rajnik\u0101nta Gupta and Nobin Chundra Bur\u0101l spoke against the proposals to increase the subscriptions and to substitute annual for quarterly payments. Messrs. Munro, Sclater and Pedler approved of the proposal to increase the subscriptions. The alterations were then put to the vote, one by one, with the following result:\n\n| For | Against | Result |\n|-----|---------|--------|\n| I. Alteration of Rule 2 (a) | 1 | All other present | Rejected. |\n| II. do. Rule 14 (c) | 5 | 6 | Rejected. |\n| III. do. Rule 16 | 3 | 7 | Rejected. |\nW.

Rules 20, 21, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 40\n\nThe abolition of Rules 26 and 27 was carried.\n\nThe proposal to abolish Rules 21, 29, 31, 32 and 40 was rejected.\n\nThe President stated that the result of the voting would be reported to the Council who would consider what further steps should be taken.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. On an inscription of the 7th Century A.D. relating to the reigning family of Meywar, found at Kund\u00e1 near Udaipur. By Mah\u00e1maho-p\u00e1dhy\u00e1 Kav\u00edr\u00e1ja Shyam\u00e1l\u00e1s, M.R.A.S., F.R.H.S., (with an ink impression and photograph).\n\n2. Notes on some of the Muhammadan coins collected by the Afghan Boundary Commission, from an historical point of view. By Major H.G. Raytery. Communicated by H. Beveridge, Esq., C.S.\n\nThe papers will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n3. Description of a two Cowree piece, the lowest denomination of the Hindu system of Copper Coinage.\u2014By W. Theobald, Esq. Communicated by Dr. W. King.\n\nAmong the coins dispersed lately in London, at the sale of the Da\u2019Cunha collection was one, now in my possession, which goes far to prove the extreme minuteness of some of the copper coins, into which the unit of the whole system, the \u2018pana\u2019 was divided.\n\nIn the concluding chapter of General Sir A. Cunningham\u2019s \u2018Coins of Alexander\u2019s successors\u2019, page 18, a table is given of the subdivisions of the \u2018pana,\u2019 which I have reproduced, neglecting the trifling variations in weight to which copper coins are more subject than are coins of the less oxidizable metals.\nIn addition to the 'pana,' there are also recorded pieces of $1\\frac{1}{4}$, $2\\frac{1}{4}$, $3\\frac{3}{4}$ and 5 panas in value, the last ranging as high as 720 grains.\n\nThe 'pana' was subdivided as follows:\n\n| Pana or 20 ganda piece | = 80 courees = 140 grains. |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| $\\frac{1}{2}$          | 10                          |\n| $\\frac{1}{4}$          | 5 (or 'k\u00e1kini')             |\n| $\\frac{1}{8}$          | $2\\frac{1}{2}$ ('k\u00e1kini')   |\n| $\\frac{1}{16}$         | 2                            |\n| $\\frac{1}{32}$         | $1\\frac{1}{4}$ ('k\u00e1kini')   |\n| $\\frac{1}{64}$         | 1                            |\n\nIn this table no smaller coin is mentioned than the twentieth part of a 'pana,' of 7 grains weight and the value of four courees, but in General Cunningham's paper on the coins of the Nine N\u00e1gas, in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1865, page 115, reference is made to a coin of $4\\frac{1}{2}$ grains, but from the context it would appear to be a worn specimen, as it is regarded as a quarter 'k\u00e1kini,' the mean weight of which is taken as 7 grains. These quarter 'k\u00e1kinis' are, it may be well to remember, round coins, whose weight, especially in the smaller denominations, is less easy to adjust with accuracy, than in the case of square coins, and whose value is too trivial to render such accuracy important.\n\nThe coin now under consideration is square, quite unworn and in excellent preservation, and weighs 4\u00b75. It is symmetrically shaped, and each side measures 0\u00b725 of an inch. From its weight I was at first inclined to regard it as the eighth part of a k\u00e1kini or the equivalent of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ courees, but Sir Alexander Cunningham, whom I consulted, is of opinion, it is rather the fortieth part of a 'pana' or two couree piece 'that division being more likely than one involving the fractional part of a couree. The highest weight of the pana is 144 grains, so that the calculated weight of $\\frac{1}{40}$ of a pana should be no more than grains 3\u00b76 which makes the piece under consideration not quite one grain in excess, but as before remarked, in such minute pieces exactness can hardly be looked for, and the present piece is in exceptional preservation. Four pieces in Sir Alexander's cabinet from Eran weigh no more than 12 grains, ranging between 2\u00b775 to 3\u00b775 grains, so that it may fairly be concluded, that a two couree piece of the ideal weight of 3\u00b76 grains was a recognised issue of the Eran and Ujain mints. The obverse displays part of two circles, which in all probability constitute a portion of the symbol of Ujain, sometimes called the 'four-balled chakra,' consisting of four circles usually united by a cross. There is also a circle, or wheel, surmounted by two 'chattras' a symbol analo-\ngous to the 'broad arrow' of the present day, and it does not seem that more were ever represented on the 'die' though three and seven of these 'broad arrow's or 'chattras' are more commonly represented on this symbol on the punch-marked coins, which were the prototypes of the later issues of Ujain. There is yet another symbol of two semi-circles, symmetrically united by their convex surfaces, but whether this is but a portion, owing to want of space on the die, of the common symbol of a 'chaitya' surmounted by a crescent, which is so common on punch-marked coins, or a symbol complete in itself, is not easy to say. These symbols stand out in fair relief, and the 'die' was evidently proportioned to the size of the coin. The square shape of the coin is a proof that its weight was intentionally fixed, as the weight would, it is clear, depend on the width of the 'ribbon' of copper, from which the blanks were cut, for the coin is a die struck coin, and not cast in a mould like so many of the early Buddhist coins. The reverse is blank, which seems to point to its being an early issue, after the fashion of the Elephant and Lion coins of Taxila.\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in December last.\n\n**Transactions, Proceedings and Journals,**  \npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nAmsterdam.

BEVERIDGE, Esq., C.S., President, in the Chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\nB\u00e1b\u00fa Nobinch\u00e1nd Bur\u00e1l, W. Connan, Esq., Hon. Sir A.W. Croft, Dr. D.D. Cunningham, B\u00e1b\u00fa Saratchandra D\u00e1s, Most Rev. Dr. Paul Goethals, B\u00e1b\u00fa Rajanik\u00e1nta Gupta, Colonel H.S. Jarrett, Dr. W. King, Rev. Father E. Lafont, C. Littile, Esq., C.J. Lyall, Esq., Kum\u00e1r Ramesw\u00e1r Mali\u00e1h, B\u00e1b\u00fa Asutosh Mukop\u00e1dhy\u00e1y, L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., J.D. Nimmo, Esq., M.H. Oung, Esq., Hon. Dr. Mahendral\u00e1l Sark\u00e1r, W.L. Scaler, Esq., Pandit Harapras\u00e1d Sh\u00e1sstri, C.H. Tawney, Esq., Dr. J.H. Tull Walsh, Colonel J. Waterhouse, J. Wood-Mason, Esq.\n\nAccording to the Bye-Laws of the Society, the President ordered the Voting papers to be distributed for the election of Office-Bearers and Members of Council for 1891, and appointed Messrs. de Nic\u00e9ville and Donaldson to be Scrutineers.\n\nThe President then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1890.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society have the honor to submit the following report on the state and progress of the Society's affairs during the past year.\nMember List.\n\nDuring the year under review 23 Ordinary Members were elected, 14 withdrew, 5 died, and 8 were removed from the list under Rule 40, being more than 3 years absent from India; of the 23 Members elected 3 were old Members who rejoined. The total number of Members at the close of 1890 was thus 303 against 307 at the end of the preceding year; of these 105 were Resident, 142 Non-Resident, 10 Foreign, 21 Life, 23 absent from India and 2 special Non-Subscribing Members, as will be seen from the following table, which also shows the fluctuations in the number of Ordinary Members during the past six years.\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-Paying |\n|------|--------|------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total | Grand Total |\n| 1885 | 105     | 161        | 13      | 279   | 16    | 34     | 1                  | 51    | 320         |\n| 1886 | 98      | 142        | 18      | 253   | 16    | 48     | 2                  | 66    | 319         |\n| 1887 | 98      | 137        | 15      | 260   | 17    | 44     | 2                  | 63    | 313         |\n| 1888 | 98      | 136        | 15      | 249   | 20    | 34     | 2                  | 56    | 305         |\n| 1889 | 108     | 195        | 13      | 256   | 22    | 27     | 2                  | 51    | 307         |\n| 1890 | 105     | 140        | 10      | 255   | 21    | 25     | 2                  | 48    | 303         |\n\nThe five Ordinary Members the loss of whom by death during the year we have to regret, were Kum\u00e1r Isvaripr\u00e1sad Garga, Dr. N. K. Roy, Mr. Alexander Grant (Life Member), Mr. E. F. T. Atkinson, and Mr. S. A. Hill.\n\nThere were no deaths amongst the Special Honorary Centenary Members, and only one amongst the Honorary Members; viz., Professor B\u00e1pu Deva S\u00e1stri, C. I. E., of Benares. Their numbers now stand at 5 and 24 respectively; being one below the normal strength.\n\nThe Corresponding Members and Associate Members remain at 7 and 8 respectively, as last year, there having been no casualties.\n\nNo Members compounded for their subscription during the year.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nNo presentations were made over to the Indian Museum.\n\nThere was only one change amongst the Trustees, caused by the resignation of Mr. E. Gay in consequence of leaving India, Mr. H. Beveridge was appointed to fill the vacant place.\nThe other Trustees on behalf of the Society were\u2014\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\nA. Pedler, Esq.\nDr. D. D. Cunningham.\nC. Little, Esq.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe accounts of the Society are shown in Statement No. 1 in the appendix under the usual heads.\n\nStatement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Society, and of the different funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1890 was taken at the following figures\u2014Receipts Rs. 13,900, Expenditure Rs. 13,840. The actual results were, Receipts Rs. 18,758 and Expenditure Rs. 21,239.\n\nThe increase in Receipts is under the heads of Subscriptions, Sales of Publications, and Interest. Subscriptions were estimated at Rs. 7,340, whilst the actuals were Rs. 7,740, the excess being due to the Government Subscription to the Society's publications having been realized for the two years 1889 and 1890. Sales of Publications show an increase of Rs. 867, owing to receipts from the sale of the extra number of the Journal, Part I, containing Mr. Grierson's \"Modern Vernacular Literature of Hindustan.\" This was expected when the estimate was prepared, as explained in the Report for last year, but no change was made in the estimate, it not being possible to anticipate what the amount might be. Interest on Investments was estimated at Rs. 6,100, the actuals have been Rs. 9,349. The large increase of Rs. 3,249 has arisen from the transfer in July last of Rs. 1,20,000 of the \"Permanent Reserve Fund\" from the 4\u00bd per cent. to the 4 per cent. loan, the Government having paid in advance the excess interest of \u00bd per cent. to September 1893 (when the loan matures), to induce holders to make the transfer; and to interest for three months having been received at 4 per cent. the payments of interest now falling due in the months of June and December, whereas under the former loan they were due in March and September.\n\nThere is also a new receipt of Rs. 300 from the Photographic Society for rent of the two rooms they occupy in the Society's building.\n\nThe expenditure has exceeded the estimate by the large sum of Rs. 7,399, of which Rs. 6,723 is on account of the Journal and Proceedings. This is due partly to the payment of Rs. 1,402 for printing Mr. Grierson's book on the \"Modern Vernacular Literature of Hindustan,\" forming an extra number to the Journal, Part I for 1888, and partly to excess payment of Rs. 4,100 on account of the Journal, Part II, caused by the adjustment of \u00a3177 for plates charged in Tr\u00fcbner's account for\n1888, which only came to hand in December last, and to larger payments for printing, owing to some of the Baptist Mission Press bills for 1889 not having been paid in that year. The Proceedings also show an increase of Rs. 1,150 from the same cause.\n\nThe actual expenditure on the Journal and Proceedings was as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Journal} & \\quad \\text{Part I.\u2014Rs. 3,206} \\\\\n& \\quad \\text{Part II.\u2014,, 6,364} \\\\\n\\text{Proceedings.\u2014} & \\quad ,, 2,053 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTotal Rs. 11,623\n\nagainst a budget provision of Rs. 4,900. There is still a sum of \u00a348 due to Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner for plates for Part II supplied in 1889, which will be adjusted on receipt of their accounts for that year.\n\nThe other items of increase are of small amount, being Rs. 279 for Books. Rs. 193 for carrying out alterations in the drainage under a notice from the Municipality. Rs. 122 for printing Circulars and forms, Rs. 66 for printing the Catalogue of Tibetan Xylographs, and Rs. 35 for purchasing a copper-plate; particulars of the plate were given in the Proceedings for December 1890.\n\nThe budget estimate for the present year has been fixed as follows. Receipts Rs. 15,570. Expenditure Rs. 14,323. On the receipt side the estimate for Subscriptions has been raised to Rs. 7,500, in consequence of the rates of subscription to the Journal and Proceedings having been brought back to those which obtained prior to 1886, when they were lowered in the hope of causing an increase of sales. There will be the full receipt of Rs. 720 this year for rent of the two rooms occupied by the Photographic Society, and also a new item for Admission Fees, which has been taken at Rs. 700, these are now to be treated as Ordinary income instead of being added to the \"Reserve Fund.\" Miscellaneous has been increased by Rs 800 in expectation of a refund of Income Tax erroneously deducted in past years from the interest on the Government Securities belonging to the Society, the Collector of Income Tax having granted a certificate that it is not liable to assessment under the Income Tax Act. The head of Interest on Investments has been taken on the amount now held in securities, but there will be an increase if the proposal to invest a portion of the Funds in Municipal or other Debentures bearing a higher rate of interest is carried out.\n\nOn the expenditure side the changes in last year's estimate are small. Postage has been increased by Rs. 100, in consequence of the Society's publications being now sent to Mofussil and Foreign Members, and\nSocieties &c. immediately on publication, instead of quarterly, as formerly. A small increase of Rs. 200 has been made for Books, and of Rs. 200 for the Journal. The other heads remain unaffected. No provision has been made for Auditors Fee, as it is proposed to revert to the former practice of having the accounts audited by two Members of the Society.\n\nThis is in accordance with rule 58 (h).\n\nThe details of the Budget Estimate are as follows:\n\n**Receipts**\n\n| Description            | Amount |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions          | Rs. 7,500 0 0 |\n| Sale of Publications   | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Interest on Investments| Rs. 5,388 0 0 |\n| Rent of rooms          | Rs. 720 0 0 |\n| Admission Fees         | Rs. 700 0 0 |\n| Miscellaneous          | Rs. 862 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 15,570 0 0\n\n**Expenditure**\n\n| Description            | Amount |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries               | Rs. 4,390 0 0 |\n| Commission             | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Stationery             | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n| Lighting               | Rs. 80 0 0 |\n| Petty Repairs          | Rs. 10 0 0 |\n| Municipal Taxes        | Rs. 819 0 0 |\n| Postage                | Rs. 700 0 0 |\n| Freight                | Rs. 10 0 0 |\n| Meeting                | Rs. 83 0 0 |\n| Contingencies          | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Books                  | Rs. 1,800 0 0 |\n| Local Periodicals      | Rs. 31 0 0 |\n| Binding                | Rs. 450 0 0 |\n| Journal, Part I        | Rs. 4,200 0 0 |\n| Journal, Part II       | Rs. 1,000 0 0 |\n| Proceedings            | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 14,323 0 0\n\n**London Agency.**\n\nMessrs. Tr\u00fcbner's statement of account with the Society for 1888, which has been so long overdue, was received just before the close of\nthe year. The only reason assigned for the great delay was, that it had evidently been sent and miscarried. The statement shows a debit balance of \u00a3369-6-4, of which \u00a3109-19-7, the balance of account for 1887, was remitted in April 1889, leaving a net debit balance of \u00a3259-6-9 on the transactions of the year.\n\nThe sales of the Society's publications effected by Messrs Tr\u00fcbner in 1888 amounted to \u00a324-5-0 and of the Bibliotheca Indica to \u00a316-13-0.\n\nThe number of copies of parts of the Journal, of the Proceedings, and of the Bibliotheca Indica sent to the Agents during 1890 for sale was 799, 450 and 1307 respectively, valued at Rs. 1,650.\n\nNine invoices of books purchased, and of publications of various Societies sent in exchange, were received during the year. The value of the books purchased amounted to \u00a380-14-6.\n\nA further remittance of \u00a3100 was made to Messrs, Tr\u00fcbner early in the year towards their accounts for 1888. Their accounts for 1889, have not yet been received.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe total number of volumes, or parts of volumes, added to the Library during the year was 2,168, of which 747 were purchased, and 1,421 presented or received in exchange for the Society's publications.\n\nThe first fasciculus of the Catalogue of the Persian works in the Oriental Library has been published; the remaining portion of the work is in the press and expected to be ready very shortly.\n\nPublications.\n\nThere were published during the year, ten numbers of the Proceedings containing 268 pages of letter press and 3 plates; four numbers of the Journal, Part I, (Nos. 3 and 4 of 1889 and Nos. 1 and 2 of 1890) containing 325 pages of letter press and 13 plates; and three numbers of the Journal, Part II containing 270 pages of letter press and 8 plates. Two numbers of the late Mr. Atkinson's Catalogue of the Insecta of the Oriental Region containing 325 pages of letter press were also issued as a Supplement to Part II; and the indexes to the Journal for 1888 and 1889, the latter containing two plates belonging to the Journal for that year.\n\nBuilding.\n\nAn unforeseen expenditure of Rs. 193-5-9 had to be incurred in carrying out certain alterations in the drainage of the grounds connecting with the sewer, consequent on a notice from the Municipality. The approval of the Municipality was obtained to the estimate for the work, as also to the manner in which it had been carried out.\nCoin Cabinet.\n\nDuring the year 87 coins were added to the Cabinet, of which 2 were of gold, 21 of silver, and 64 of copper. One of the gold coins was presented by the Govt. N.-W. Provinces, all the rest were acquired under the Treasure Trove Act, and were from the Bengal Presidency. They all belong to ordinary types and detailed notices of them have been given in the Proceedings for May, June and July.\n\nOffice of the Secretaries.\n\nDr. Hoernle carried on the duties of Philological Secretary until June, when he went on leave and Major Sadler took them up until September when he left Calcutta temporarily and made them over to Dr. Solf, who carried them on until the middle of December, when he was obliged to leave India owing to ill health. Mr. Tawney has agreed to carry on the work till Dr. Hoernle's return.\n\nMr. Wood-Mason resigned the editorship of the Journal, Part II in June and Mr. Sclater was appointed Natural History Secretary and editor. He went on short leave in September, and Col. Waterhouse took charge of the Journal during the interval.\n\nDr. W. King carried on the duties of Treasurer during the year except for two periods of about two months each, when he had to leave Calcutta on duty, and Mr. Sclater took charge of the work.\n\nMr. H. Ronaldson was Assistant-Secretary throughout the year.\n\nMr. J. H. Elliott rejoined his post of Assistant-Librarian on the expiry of his leave in March. There were no changes in the posts of Cashier, Pandit and Copyist, which were held by the permanent incumbents B\u00e1b\u00fa Nritya Gopal Bose, Pandit Hari Mohan Vidy\u00e1bh\u00fashan and B\u00e1b\u00fa Joges Chandra Chatterjee respectively.\n\nBibliotheca Indica.\n\nForty-five fasciculi were published during the year, of which twelve were in the Arabic-Persian, twenty-seven in the Sanskrit, and six in the Tibetan series.

F. Rudolf Hoernle again exhibited the old birch bark MS., brought by Lieut. Bower from Kashgaria, and made the following remarks concerning it:\n\n\"This MS. was first shown to the Society in November last, in the Proceedings of which month an account of its acquisition by Lieut. Bower is printed. That account appears to have been reprinted in the Bombay Gazette, a copy of which accidentally fell into my hands in Aden on my way out to India in March last. It was the first notice I had of it; Major Cumberland, whose companion Lieut. Bower had been on his travels, was a fellow-passenger of mine and gave me corroborative information; all this made me very anxious to see the MS. On my reaching Calcutta I was very glad to find that the MS. was still in the possession of Colonel Waterhouse, who very kindly at once made it over to me for examination.\n\n\"The MS. has been with me only a little more than a week, and my examination of it, of course, is not yet finished; but I have already been able to determine several important points; and as hitherto it has been impossible to ascertain anything about the character and contents of the manuscript, I will not delay communicating my information, though further examination may possibly induce me to modify it on some minor points.\n\n\"The first point that strikes one on looking through the MS. is, that it appears to be written in three, if not four, different styles. This point has been already noticed in the November account. But what is more,\u2014the difference is not (as may seem at first sight) merely one of careful and slovenly writing, but one of variety of alphabet. The whole manuscript is written in what Mr. Fleet (in his Gupta Inscriptions in Volume III of the Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, p. 3) distinguishes as the Northern class of the N\u0101gar\u012b alphabet, which is characterised by the peculiar form of the m. Of this class, however, three varieties are observable in the MS. The test-letter of these varieties is the palatal \u015b, which is formed in three different ways.

The first variety of writing is shown in the upper portion of Plate VI published in the November Proceedings; and the third variety in the lower portion. Of the second variety\u2014one of great neatness\u2014a specimen is now figured in the lower part of Plate I, which accompanies this account. The upper part of this plate gives another specimen of the first variety. The three varieties have no reference to difference of age, but merely indicate difference of locality. The second and third varieties, as shown by their approach to the S\u0101rad\u0101 characters, were probably current in the extreme North-West of the great area of the Northern class of alphabets, while the first variety was used in the remainder of that area.\n\n\"On examining more closely the several leaves, I noticed that they were evidently mixed up. The leaves written in the different hands followed one another without any order. But I also noticed that many of the leaves were marked with numbers on their left hand margin. Accordingly I cut the string which passed through them and held them together, and arranged them in their proper order, as indicated by their numbers. It then was seen, that 33 leaves, forming the main portion of the MS., followed in consecutive order, and that these 33 leaves were written throughout in the first variety of the alphabet. This variety extended to the obverse of the 33rd leaf; but on the reverse of that leaf commenced the second variety, and went on over five leaves. The remainder of the leaves were written in the third variety.\n\n\"It further seemed that the three varieties of writing distinguished three different works, the reasons of which I shall explain presently.\n\n\"I now took up the main portion (of 33 leaves), and deciphering the first page of the first leaf, discovered that it contained an introduction, giving the name of the work and detailing its contents. The work is a compendium of medicine, is named the N\u0101vanitaka, and consists of sixteen chapters (adhy\u0101ya). That it was written* by a Buddhist, is seen from the initiatory salutation of the \"Tath\u0101gatas\" or Buddhas.

As the rasayana are a distinct subject from the vaidya, it seems clear that the word rasayana-vidhanatah refers to the sixth chapter. The text may be corrupt, and should probably be read rasayana-vidha tatah i.e., 'next the rules about elixirs,' or perhaps rasayana-vidhis = tatah, the word tatah indicating the sixth chapter.\n\n\u2021 The two aksharas \u0939\u0943\u0926\u093f are omitted in the MS.\nTranslation.*\n\n'Salutation to the Tath\u0101gatas.\u2014I am going to write an approved compendium (of medicine), called the N\u0101vanitaka, based on the excellent system of the Maharshis as composed by them in olden times. Whatever is useful to men and women afflicted with various diseases; whatever is also useful for children, that will all be declared in this book. It will commend itself to those physicians whose minds delight in conciseness; but on account of the multiplicity of its prescriptions, it will also be welcome to those whose minds love many details.\n\n'The first chapter will give prescriptions of powders; the second of clarified butter; the third will be concerned with oils. The fourth will be about the mixtures which are used in the treatment of various diseases. The fifth will give prescriptions of clysters, the sixth rules about elixirs. The seventh will be about gruels, the eighth about aphrodisiacs, the ninth about eyewashes, the tenth about hair-dyes. The eleventh will be concerned with applications of the yellow myrobalan.\u2020 The twelfth will be about bitumen, the thirteenth about castor-oil. The fourteenth will be concerned with the treatment of children; the fifteenth will deal with the treatment of barren women. Lastly the sixteenth will be about the treatment of women who have children. These sixteen chapters will constitute the N\u0101vanitaka. It should not be given to any one who has no son, nor to any one who has no brother; nor should it be taught to any one who has no disciple.'\n\n\"After this commences the first chapter on the ch\u016br\u1e47as or powders; it extends down to the obverse of the fourth leaf, where its end is indicated by the words \u0928\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093f\u0924\u0915\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0925\u092e\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0924\u0902 i.e., 'in the N\u0101vanitaka the prescriptions of powders are finished; the first chapter is finished.' The following are some of the names of the powders that I have noticed: varddham\u0101naka, shady\u0101dika, tiktaka, vrisha-dv\u0101da\u015baka, ar\u012b\u1e63\u1e6da, etc.\n\n\"The second chapter on clarified butter extends to the obverse of the ninth leaf, where we find the remark \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0940\u092f\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0924\u0902 i.e., '(here ends) the second chapter; I shall (now) explain the Val\u0101 oil, the cure for rheumatism.' The following are some of the names of clarified butter; after each name the number of \u015blokas about it are given: thus amrita-pr\u0101\u015ba with 10 \u015blokas, kaly\u0101\u1e47aka with 4, tiktaka with 4, mah\u0101tiktaka with 7, m\u1e5bidvika with 3, m\u0101y\u016bra with 7, etc.\n\n* The translation is tentative. Some of the medical terms are not known to me, nor to those Kavir\u0101j\u015b whom I consulted.\n\n\u2020 Abhay\u0101, I am told by a Kavir\u0101j, is a synonym of har\u012btak\u012b. See also Glossary to the Bibliotheca Indica edition of the \u0100\u015bva Vaidyaka.\n\"The third chapter on oils extends to the obverse of the thirteenth leaf, where it ends thus: (here ends) the third chapter on oils in the approved compendium N\u00e1vanitaka; in the following we shall declare miscellaneous prescriptions.\" The following are some of the kinds of oil spoken of: val\u00e1 oil in 16 \u015blokas, amr\u012bta oil in 25 \u015blokas, \u0101svagandh\u0101 oil, etc.\n\n\"The fourth chapter on mixtures or miscellaneous prescriptions ends on the obverse of the seventeenth leaf, with the words: here (ends) the fourth chapter in the N\u00e1vanitaka, (called) Mi\u015braka; in the sequel I am going to declare means of improving vigour and colour, by which good spirits are increased and vigour also is generated.\" Of this chapter I may give the following verses as a specimen:\n\ni.e. (1) 'Let thoroughly parched sesamum seed, well sprinkled into thickened milk, be pressed to consistency; or with the same sesamum seed mixed with liquorice a plaster may be made for rheumatism.\n\n(2) Thickened goat's milk and (flour of) wheat with clarified butter makes an excellent ointment. This may be considered the principal remedy against rheumatism (or gout).\n\nThe above are two prescriptions for the curing of rheumatism.\n\n(1) Clarified butter, oil, treacle, vinegar, and, as the fifth, ginger; these, when drunk, are an instant remedy against pains in the lower part of the spine (i.e., against lumbago).\n\n(2) Castor-oil, the root of long pepper, the vach\u00e1-root, the Helleborus niger, the Stephania Hernandifolia, and the seed of Holarrhena Antidysenterica and chebulic myrobalan are a grund remedy.'\n\"From the fourth chapter onwards I have not yet been able fully to trace the remaining chapters. On the 24th and 25th leaves I have noticed several names of gruels or yavagu, which belong to the seventh chapter.\n\n\"On the obverse of the 28th leaf I have noticed the ending of the 8th chapter, thus \u0928\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0947\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u0938\u0902\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u0917\u092e\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e\u092e\u0947\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u0938\u0902\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u091a \u0935\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0903 | i.e., 'here end the prescriptions of Aphrodisiacs (as set forth) in the approved compendium N\u0101van\u012btaka according to the doctrine of various \u0100ch\u0101ryas.'\n\n\"On a subsequent leaf I have noticed portions of the eleventh chapter; and on another the beginnings of the twelfth and thirteenth chapters: thus \u0936\u0941\u0927\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u0938\u0902\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094d and \u0936\u0941\u0927\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u0938\u0902\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094d | i.e. 'here we shall explain the application of bitumen' and 'here we explain the application of castor-oil.'\n\n\"So far as I can judge for the present, the MS. does not seem to be complete; though I cannot say whether much or little of it is lost.\n\n\"As I explained before, this medical work ends on the obverse of a certain leaf; and on the reverse of that leaf commences what appears to be a different work written in the second variety of the alphabet. At the bottom of the obverse of this leaf, marking apparently the end of the medical work, there is a line of writing, in the third variety of the alphabet.

Whatever undertaking thou thinkest of, that will be fruitless.\n\n'2, From diseases thou shalt quickly be delivered; and happiness thou shalt obtain; and a result thou shalt enjoy, neither very great nor very small.\n\n'3, Fearful is sure to be the exertion with those, with whom thou hast a quarrel; fruitless is sure to be the business of which thou askest the causes.'\n\n\"The whole consists of similar proverbial sayings divided in sets. Thus besides the above three \u015b\u0101pa\u1e6da, there are three m\u0101\u1e6di, five bahula, three k\u016b\u1e6da, four bhadra, six \u015bakti, six dundubhi, three vrisha, three preshy\u0101, three vi\u1e6d\u1e6di, three kar\u1e47a, three saj\u0101, three k\u0101\u1e47a, three chunchura, three pa\u00f1ji or p\u0101\u00f1ji, etc. What these terms may mean I do not know.\n\n\"The system of enumeration, however, is curious and noteworthy. The three \u015b\u0101pa\u1e6da are indicated by varying the relative position of three numbers: 443, 434, 344. Similarly the six \u015bakti are enumerated by the variations of 341 = first, 134 = second, 413 = third, 314 = fourth, 143 = fifth, 431 = sixth.\n\n\"I may here note that the numbers are indicated, through all the three portions of the MS., not by means of numeral figures, but numeral letters. Nor is the modern decimal system of notation used, but the older one which indicated the tens, hundreds, etc. by separate signs; thus 16 is expressed by the symbols for 10 and 6, 25 by those for 20 and 5, etc.\n\n\"Regarding the third portion of the MS., I can say, for the present but little. It is written in a third variety of the alphabet. It appears to contain charms or prayers, and to be of small interest. But I have not yet been able to examine it more closely. A specimen of it is given in the lower portion of the plate which accompanies the account in the November Proceedings. That specimen reads thus:\n\nline 1, \u0939\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0940 - \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0928\u0940 - \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0940 - \u0938\u094d\u0935\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u0940 - \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0940 - \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0940 - \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 - \u0915\u0902\u092a\u0928\u0940 - \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0928\u0940(?).\n\nline 2, \u092e\u0947 - \u092e\u094b\u0939\u093e\u092f\u093e: \u092a\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092f \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0941 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u094b \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0947\u0928 - \u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u093f \u0916\u091a\u093e (read \u0916\u091a\u093e ?)\u0964 \u092c\u0948\u091a\u0940 \u092e\u0947 \u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0947\u0937\u0941 (read \u0916\u091a\u093e ?) \u092c\u0948\u091a\u0940 \u0928\u0948\u0930\u093e-\n\n* The dots signify illegible aksharas.\ni.e., 'may God rain all over my territory; hail to Ilikisi; my loving trust is in Dhritarashtra; my loving trust is in Nairavana (Airavana?); in Virupaksha is my loving trust and in Krishna Gantama; in Mani, the king of Nagas is my loving trust, also in Vasuki; in Dandapada, in? and in Purabhadra at all times; in Nanda and Upananda, the beautiful and glorious, who most successfully maintain a contest even with the Gods and Asuras; in Anavatapta, in Varuna is my loving trust, and in Samhara; in Takshaka, Ananta, and further in Vasumukha; in Aparajita is my loving trust; and my loving trust is in Chhibbasuta (?); and likewise in Mahamanasvin perpetually.'\n\nThe language of the manuscript is Sanskrit; not, however, the ordinary standard Sanskrit, but that species of ungrammatical Sanskrit, which formerly used to be known by the name of the Gatha dialect, and which was the language used for literary purposes by the Northern or North-Western Buddhists, outside the schools of Brahmanic learning, in the centuries immediately before and after the commencement of the Christian era. It was a species of Sanskrit which in inflexion, syntax and metrics was not bound by the ordinary rules and usages of Sanskrit Grammar. The awkwardness of the Sanskrit in the introductory verses is noticeable. The word adhyaya is used as being of the neuter gender, while in the standard Sanskrit it is masculine. In the second extract we have pishayet for the regular Sanskrit peshayet, and, in the colophon quoted above it, the wrong concord valam upajayante (singular subject with plural predicate). In the third extract, parihiyate stands for parikhiyate and karana is used as the accusative plural, instead of karapami. In the fourth extract, we have the irregular sandhi devo samantena for the ordinary Sanskrit devah samantena; again the initial a of anavataptena and of aparajitenena must be dropped or taken as absorbed in the preceding syllable, in order to make the verse (sloka) scan; moreover the initial two shorts of\nvarunena must be taken to be equivalent to one long, in order to conform the line to the ordinary rules of a sloka; so also in the first half line of the eighth sloka in the first extract, where the two shorts of subhaq\u0101 must be taken as one long. Many more examples of a similar kind might be quoted.\n\n\"Now as to the age of the MS., I believe it to be very old and written not later than the end of the 5th century A.D. The style of writing is exactly like that which we meet with in the early Gupta inscriptions, between 450 and 550 A.D. These may best be seen in Mr. Fleet's volume III of the Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum.\n\n\"One of the test letters, for the determination of age, of the N\u0101gar\u012b alphabet\u2014and the most important one in the present case\u2014is the akshara ya. Its original form was \u092f; this changed to \u092f or \u092f; next the left hand loop-line was extended to the point of junction of the perpendicular stroke, \u092f. The object of this, of course, was to permit of the letter being written with one continuous movement of the hand. The next step was to dissolve the point of junction, \u092f, a natural consequence of quick writing. From this point, the modern form was quickly reached. The whole course of this development is clearly traceable during the period (about 400 to 600 A.D.) of the early Gupta alphabet. The initial forms \u092f and \u092f we find still used throughout in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudra Gupta (about 400 A.D., see Fleet, ibid., p. 6), the Udayagiri Cave inscription of Chandra Gupta II (c. 410 A.D., ibid., p. 35), the Bilsad pillar inscription of Kum\u0101ra Gupta (415 A.D., ibid., p. 45), the Mathur\u0101 image inscription of Skanda Gupta (454 A.D., ibid., p. 263), the Bhitar\u0101 pillar inscription of Skanda Gupta (c. 460 A.D., ibid., p. 53), the Kahaum pillar inscription of Skanda Gupta (460 A.D., ibid., p. 67), etc. The final form \u092f is already used throughout the Bodhgaya inscription of Mah\u0101n\u0101man (588 A.D., ibid., p. 274), and in the Asphad stone inscription of Adityasena (c. 650; ibid., p. 202). The intermediate form \u092f is only found in the Indor copper plate inscription of Skanda Gupta, of 465 A.D. (ibid., p. 68), the Mandasor stone inscription of Kum\u0101ra Gupta, of 473 A.D. (ibid., p. 79), the Majhgawan copperplate inscription of Hastin, of 510 A.D. (ibid., p. 106), and the Jaunpur stone inscription of \u015ar\u012bvaravarman of about 520 A.D. (ibid., p. 228). With regard to this intermediate form it is particularly to be noticed, that it occurs side by side with the older forms \u092f or \u092f, and that it is exclusively used with the vowels e and o. Thus we have it in the Indore plate in yojyam (line 7); again in the Mandasor inscription in yo and priyo (line 14); again in the Majhgawan plate in chhreyo (line 14), yo (line 16), ye (line 18); again\nin the Jaunpur inscription in anvav\u0101ye (line 2). Now precisely the same practice is noticeable in the main portion of the MS., written in the first variety of the alphabet. The older form is used throughout, except in connection with the vowels e and o, when the intermediate form is used optionally with the older form. Thus in Plate I, No. I, the intermediate form occurs twice in the 2nd line in yoga, and in the 9th line in kalpayet. Again in the upper portion of Plate VI of the November Proceedings the intermediate form occurs in the middle of the third line in lepayet, and in the beginning of the 6th line in misrayet; also twice in the beginning of the 11th line in prayojayet. On the other hand we have the older form in Plate I, No. I, 10th line, ch\u016brnayet, and in Plate VI of the November Proceedings, 2nd line, kalpayet; and both the older and intermediate forms we have in the same Plate VI, middle of 6th line, prayojayet. Once I have noticed the intermediate form with the analogous case of the vowel ai, viz., in Plate VI, middle of 4th line, jiv\u0101n\u0101ja\u015b=cha. The inscriptions show that this intermediate form was peculiar to a particular period, the limits of which may be roughly put down as between 470 and 530 A.D. It is not found in any inscription either before or after these dates. And as inscriptions longer conserve archaic forms of writing than manuscripts, that fact further proves that the date of writing the MS. must fall somewhere within that period, that is, about 500 A.D. I have not noticed the intermediate form of ya either in the second or in the third portion of the MS. In both these portions, the older forms are used exclusively; and as these portions were certainly written after the first portion, they confirm the conclusion, that the writing of the whole MS. cannot be placed later than 500 A.D.\n\n\"As tending to confirm this conclusion, it may be further noted that throughout the MS., wherever there is any occasion to use a number, whether in the body of the work in numbering \u015blokas, or on the margin of the leaves in numbering the latter, the ancient practice of employing numeral letters is exclusively followed, while numeral figures are never used. What is more,\u2014there is no trace of the knowledge of the modern system of notation with the help of the zero and the value of position; every numeral sign has its own fixed value, independent of the position it may occupy in a series, there being separate signs for the units, the tens, hundreds, etc. Thus 'twenty-five' is not expressed by the signs for 'two' and 'five' (i.e. 25), placed in a certain order, which order imparts the value of 'twenty' to the sign for 'two;' but it is expressed by two special signs, one for 'twenty,' the other for 'five.' That the 'value of position' was not known to the writer of the second part of the MS., seems\nto be clearly shown by his curious system of numbering the several \u015blokas of a set. Thus the three \u015blokas of the \u015b\u0101pata set are numbered 443, 434 and 344, which does not mean 'four hundred and forty-three,' 'four hundred and thirty-four,' and 'three hundred and forty-four.' This would have no meaning. The position of the figures in the three series imparts no numerical value; 4 means 'four,' and 3 means 'three,' in whatever position they may be. The three series can only be read 'four four three,' 'four three four' and 'three four four;' and the variation in the position of the three unit figures only serves to enumerate three different \u015blokas. Now the discoveries of the zero and of the value of position may, with much probability, be placed at some time within the sixth century A.D.; and thus the writing of our MS., must be referred to a time, not later than the beginning of that century, or about 500 A.D.\n\n\"This, I believe, makes our MS. the oldest Indian written book that is known to exist. There is indeed another MS. which is nearly as old; that is, the so-called Horiuzi MS., published in the Anecdota Oxoniensia, Vol. III. But if I understand the case rightly, that MS. consists only of two leaves, and is preserved, not in India, but in Japan. Professor B\u00fchler, who has described it, assigns to it the date of about 550 A.D. The MSS., next in age, are two Nepalese of the Cambridge collection, viz., Add. 1049 and 1702, described in Mr. Bendall's Catalogue, pp. xxxix ff.; and the so-called Bakhsh\u00e1il MS., described by myself in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. XVII, pp. 33ff. It will be observed that both Nepalese MSS. exhibit throughout the modern form of ya (though in slightly differing variations) as it became established at the end of the sixth century A.D. As the Bodhgaya inscription of Mah\u00e1n\u00e1man, of 588 A.D., shows throughout the same form of ya, it appears to me not impossible that the MS., Add. 1049, dated Samvat 252, which is referred by Mr. Bendall to 857 A.D., may really be placed in 571 A.D. being dated in terms of the Gupta era. Neither the old, nor the intermediate forms of ya occur in the Nepalese MSS., while in our MS. these are the only forms that are employed, the modern form being, conspicuous by its entire absence.\n\n\"I may note one or two other peculiarities. In the first place, the oldest form of the long vowel \u00e1 is a small horizontal stroke attached to the top of the right side of a consonant. A peculiar modification of this form is the attachment of the stroke to the middle of the right side. This form has, so far as I am aware, hitherto only been noticed in the Allahabad stone pillar inscription of Samudra Gupta, which dates from about 400 A.D., see Fleet, Corpus Inscrip. Ind. Vol. III., p. 4. Compare, e.g., the akshara \u0906 of \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917 in line 31 of that inscription with the \u0906 of\nIn line 4 and of \u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938 in line 5 of the lower part of Plate VI in the November Proceedings. I have noticed this peculiar form of \u0936 only in the that portion of the MS., which is written in the third variety of the alphabet.\n\n\"In the second place a peculiarity of the style of writing of the period of the early Gupta inscriptions is the practice of appending a final consonant, i.e., a consonant without an inherent vowel, below the line in very small size. In fact this practice is the early substitute of the modern vir\u0101ma. Thus compare the very last word \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0926 in the bottom line, and the word \u0936\u0940\u0930\u0915 just three lines above it, in the upper portion of the plate in the November Proceedings, again \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0924\u0941 and \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0923\u0940\u0924\u0915\u094d\u0937 in line 1, \u091a\u0942\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0924 in line 10 of Plate I, No. I, with the word \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0923\u0935\u0924 in line 11 of the Bilsad pillar inscription of Kum\u0101ra Gupta, of 415 A.D. (Fleet, p. 44), or \u0924\u094b\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0924 at the end of line 11 of the Kahau\u1e47 stone pillar inscription of Skanda Gupta, of 460 A.D. (ibid., p. 67), or \u091a\u094b\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0924 at the end of line 9 of the Indore copperplate of Skanda Gupta, of 465 A.D. (ibid., p. 70), or \u091a\u0942\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0924 in line 6 of the Gwalior inscription of Mihirakula, of about 515 A.D. (ibid., p. 162), or \u091a\u093f\u092c\u094d\u092f\u0924 in line 1, \u091a\u093e\u0930\u0923\u0935\u0924 in l. 13, \u091a\u0942\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0924\u092a\u093e\u0924 in l. 17 of the Mandasor inscription of Ya\u015bodharman, of 533 A.D. (ibid., p. 152), or \u091a\u0942\u0937\u094d\u092f in line 1 of the Jaunpur inscription of Y\u00e9varavarman, of about 520 A.D. (ibid., p. 229). This practice of spelling I have observed throughout every part of the manuscript.\"\n\n[PS. A fuller account of the MS., and specially of the reasons of dating it so early, I hope shortly to publish.]\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited 5 Indo-Sassanian and 4 Mughal coins presented to the Society by the Government of Bombay through the Bombay Branch, Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following report on a find of Treasure Trove Coins.\n\nReport on four old coins, forwarded by the Secretary to the Government, N.-W. Provinces and Oudh, Financial Department, with his No. 3790 x, 25, dated 3rd June, 1890.\n\nThese four coins are stated to form a part of the find which is referred to in my Report of the 9th May 1890.\n\nThree of them belong to precisely the same variety as the four coins, described in that Report. Nor are they in any better state of preservation; and afford no further help in determining the name of the king, who issued them. I may remark, however, that the name\nkritavarman, as inscribed on the paper, in which the coins were received, is certainly read wrongly. For the reading varman there is absolutely no ground on the coins; krita may be correct; though the letters on the coin look more like kriga.\n\nThe fourth coin belongs to the same class of the so-called later Indo-Scythian coins of the \"Kida\" type; but to a different variety. The obverse shows, as usual, the standing figure of the king, with keda under his left arm; under his right arm are two letters \u0915\u0936 kasa or \u0930\u0936 rasa; on the proper left margin there is a mutilated \u0936 sha. The reverse shows the seated form of the goddess, and along the proper left margin \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u091a\u091a\u094d\u091b S'ri Chachcha with faint traces of another (probably) conjunct letter. The full legend may have been \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u091a\u091a\u094d\u091b S'ri Chachcha, i.e., \"of the illustrious (king) Chachcha.\" The name \"Chachcha\" appears to me perfectly clear on the coin; and I am disposed to ascribe the coin to the well-known R\u00e1ja Ch\u00e1ch of Sindh, whose history is related in the Ch\u00e1chn\u00e1ma (see Sir H. Elliot's History of India, Vol. I, p. 131). He reigned about 650 A.D.\n\nColonel Waterhouse exhibited some silver and glass plates showing reversed deposits obtained by passing electric currents through photographic 'developers' containing thio-carbamides and said:\n\nAt the meeting of the Society in August last, I exhibited some specimens of a curious reversal of the photographic image produced by adding small quantities of thio-carbamides or sulpho-ureas to the ordinary eikonogen developer, and showed that although reversal of the image was by no means uncommon, it was usually caused by over-exposure or some other abnormal action of light, whereas to produce these new reversals even less than the ordinary exposure was sufficient, and they appeared to be entirely due to some peculiar action of the thio-carbamide added in very minute quantities to an alkaline eikonogen developer.\n\nAt that time I was quite unable to offer any opinion as to the probable cause of these reversals, or as to how they were produced, beyond stating the probability that, although there were many points of difference, they would be found to be in accordance with the generally accepted theory worked out by Capt. Abney, and were due more or less to oxidation or rehalogenisation of the exposed parts of the film, and that owing to the peculiar reducing action of the alkaline thio-carbamides the film during development was practically in the same state as if it were over-exposed. It seemed also probable that sulphur was the active agent in producing the reversals.\nFurther work with these curious salts and especially with a compound salt of thio-carbamide and ammonium bromide, discovered by Prof. J. E. Reynolds in 1868 and called by him tetrathiocarbamid-ammonium bromide, which was found to be exceedingly active in producing perfect reversals of the image with very short exposures, led me to the belief that this complete change of deposit from the lights to the shadows of the photographic image must be more or less due to electro-chemical action. The subject of electro-chemistry is one of which I have little knowledge, but I have been able to make some simple experiments from which, though not conclusive, it seems probable that my surmise is correct, and so far as they go, they seem to establish that not only, as former observations by Lermontoff, Eder and Abney had shewn to be probable, is the ordinary process of photographic development of sensitive surfaces containing silver haloids, accompanied by electrical action, but that the addition of these minute quantities of thio-carbamides to the developer, greatly increases the intensity of the electrical action and produces a reversal of the current which should also account for the reversal of deposit.\n\nWith the aid of a very sensitive galvanometer, which has been kindly lent me by the Rev. Fr. Lafont, S. J., who also assisted me in the experiment, it was found that when a pair of pure silver plates coated with finely precipitated silver bromide, one of which had been exposed to light and the other not, were connected to the galvanometer so as to form a galvanic couple and immersed in the ordinary eikonogen developer, the exposed plate formed the negative pole and the needle was deflected to the left; whilst in the developer containing a little thio-sinamine, the exposed plate formed the positive pole and the needle was deflected to the right.\n\nThis experiment has been successfully repeated several times with silver plates prepared in the same way and with other thio-carbamides, also with silver plates bromised by dipping them in bromine water; and so far the occurrence of the reversal is well established. I propose to repeat the experiment before you though I cannot be certain of success. (The reversal was successfully shown with bromised plates, the image of the needle and scale being projected on the wall.)\n\nI have also tried the same experiment with ordinary dry plates rendered conductive in various ways, the best of which appears to be gold leaf applied either on the face of the film or behind it. Gelatine offers very great resistance to the current, and though I have obtained distinct evidence of currents in both directions, they are not always observable, nor is it yet quite certain that they are caused by electrolytic action within the gelatine film, and further investigation as to this is necessary.\nI have also found that reversals of the reduction products, somewhat similar to those obtained by photographic methods, may be obtained entirely without the agency of light by passing a current from a single bichromate cell through a pair of silver plates coated with silver bromide and immersed in eikonogen developers prepared with or without thio-carbamides. In this case the plate attached to the carbon pole in the plain developer showed only a very little black deposit, whilst the plate attached to the zinc pole showed a very strong dark deposit all over. A pair of similar plates immersed in some of the same developer to which a few drops of a solution of thio-sinamine had been added showed quite different results, the plate attached to the carbon pole showing a strong black deposit, while the plate attached to the zinc pole was almost clear on the face and free from deposit, showing only a slight tarnish, caused by sulphur. I have some plates of this kind here, though the reversed effect is not quite so strong as it was on my first plates. I have found it difficult to obtain such marked reversals again though I quite believe they are obtainable and the best conditions for securing successful results have yet to be ascertained.\n\nSome similar effects were produced on Eastman's bromide paper and on ordinary dry plate films attached to the silver plates.\n\nAlthough results obtained with silver bromide on silver plates are not quite comparable with those obtained with ordinary gelatine plates, these experiments show that under favourable circumstances the action of developing solutions on silver bromide is accompanied by distinct electric action, and that these thio-carbamide reversals may be produced by electrical methods and are attended by a reversal of current. How this reversal of current is brought about is not yet quite clear, but seems to be explained by some observations on metallic sulphides, by W. Skey, recorded in Vol. XXIII of the Chemical News. He found that sulphides which have the power of conducting can also generate electricity and that silver sulphide is positive to metallic silver. In a battery consisting of a sulphide and a metal in acidulated water, the gas liberated is sulphuretted hydrogen, the nascent hydrogen exerting a desulphurising action upon the metallic sulphide, the ultimate effect of which is in some cases to completely reduce the mineral to the metallic state. He shows also that these sulphides are capable of performing the functions of the negative element of a galvanic couple.\n\nIt seems probable, therefore, if electrolytic action does take place in gelatine films during the process of photographic development, that, according to the laws of electrolysis, with the ordinary developers the exposed parts of the plate form the negative pole and attract the metallic elements and hydrogen, while the bromine, or other halogen and\nacid radicals, with the hydroxyl go to the unexposed parts forming the positive pole.\n\nOn the other hand, with the alkaline thio-carbamide developers, at the same time that silver is reduced on the exposed parts, silver sulphide is formed on the unexposed parts which then become the negative pole and attract the sulphur, the hydrogen and some of the silver from the exposed parts; while the halogen and hydroxyl pass to the positive pole and transform part of the remaining silver into silver haloid which is dissolved in the fixing bath.\n\nAlthough this theory, as stated in a rough way, seems to agree fairly well with the facts, and from the experiments I have made seems probably the correct explanation of the reversals, I do not feel myself yet able to put it forward authoritatively, and a great deal of further investigation is required. The subject is a very difficult one beset with uncertainties, and requires more time and close attention than I have been able to give for working it out fully.\n\nThe theory that photographic action is accompanied by electrical phenomena is no new one. Becquerel found that if silver plates coated with silver bromide or other haloid silver salts were electrically connected and immersed in dilute acid, and light was allowed to fall upon one plate while the other was screened, the effect of the light was marked by distinct electrical action capable of deflecting the needle of a galvanometer. Prof. Minchin has recently found that the same effect is produced on silver plates coated with silver haloids in emulsions of gelatine or collodion, and immersed in very dilute solutions of alkaline bromides, iodides or chlorides. He has also found that if silver plates coated with a silver bromide emulsion in gelatine are attached to the poles of a battery, and half immersed in a weak solution of potassium bromide, the film attached to the carbon pole was visibly blackened on its immersed part, while no visible effect was produced on the other, but on developing this plate with pyrogallic acid and ammonia, its immersed part also became dark, exactly as if it had been exposed to light for a few seconds.\n\nThere is a good deal of other more or less direct evidence that an electrolytic action takes place during development, although so far as I can ascertain no observations of the currents with a galvanometer are recorded. Comparatively little attention has, however, been given to the question, and electrical or electrochemical action has never been looked upon as a principal factor in the production of the photographic image. From these new results it would appear that, at any rate as regards the silver haloids, the formation and development of the photographic image is to a very great extent influenced by electrical action,\nif not actually caused by it. It has lately been found that electro-\nchemical reactions have explained many obscure points in ordinary\nchemistry, and it seems likely therefore that further investigation of\nphotographic action by the light of the most recent electro-chemical\ntheories would also throw light on much that is now obscure and\nuncertain as regards the formation and development of the invisible\nphotographic image. Prof. Meldola in his \"Chemistry of Photography\"\nnotes these micro-electrical phenomena in photography as subjects\nfor further investigation, and I hope these experiments may prove a\nuseful contribution to the investigation.\n\nB\u00e1b\u00fa Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s exhibited and read a short note on a\ndrawing of the Paradise of the Northern Buddhists called De-wa-chan\nin Tibetan and \"Sukh\u00e1vati\" in Sanskrit. (With a plate).\n\nA Short note on the Paradise of the Northern Buddhists.\n\nThe inscription on the top of this Tibetan drawing of \"Sukh\u00e1vati\"\nthe paradise of the northern Buddhists is, in the rectangular form of the\nSanskrit character of the 6th\u20147th century A.D. Transliterated into\nRoman character, it stands thus:\u2014\n\nSukh\u00e1vati hi \u015bi\u1e45 bkod tshe phyi ma\u1e45i\n\n*Mtho\u1e45 var byed-pa shes bya-va.\n\n\"The design of Sukh\u00e1vati world called 'the prospective of future\nexistence.'\"\n\nThis imaginary world, believed by the Buddhists of the Mah\u00e1y\u00e1na\nschool to be a reality, lies far to the west beyond numberless worlds.\nIn physical aspect, general character &c., it is said to resemble this\nworld of ours, but the great law of procreation which is the prime cause\nof all that have life in this world does not prevail in Sukh\u00e1vati.\nThere all living beings are born, not from the effect of their former\ndeeds, but in consequence of their moral merits and prayers. A pious\nBuddhist of this world prays, for being born into Sukh\u00e1vati. When at\nthe time of his death he sees, the Buddha and his sainted followers\neither in sleep or in wakeful dreams, he is sure to be born in Sukh\u00e1vati.\nHis soul instantaneously travels many millions of miles westward and\nenters a lotus blossom which serves him for a womb. In course of time\nhe grows out of the lotus flower and develops into a full grown man.\nHe is found endowed with the power of comprehension, meditation\nand foreknowledge, and is soon able to work miracles. Women\n\n* The italics are silent.\nhave no place there and the agency of the sexes is altogether unknown in Sukh\u00e1vati. Indeed k\u00e1ma that faculty of procreation which is, the cause of all worldly miseries, according to the Buddhists does not at all exist there. In this paradise Amit\u00e1bha the Buddha of immeasurable light rules supreme in love. Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, with a lotus in his hand sits to the right and Vajra P\u00e1ni has his seat on the left. Two rays of divine light emanating from the heart of the Supreme Buddha, travel east- and west-ward, touching a saintly Lama and a Buddha who has attained perfection, and will not go back to the world. This Lama in the present kalpa is the grand Lama of Tasbilunpo whose spirit is in Sukh\u00e1vati, but who of his own free-will chooses, for the good of all living beings of this world, to reside in flesh in the holy land of Tibet.\n\nThe Buddha's place is taken by successive arrivals. Fine trees, lovely flowers, fragrant shrubs abound in Sukh\u00e1vati. Birds of richest hues and plumage and sweetest notes fly, freely in Sukh\u00e1vati. The beasts of forests roam at large without doing mischief to each other. The woods resound with the chorus of divine music. In that blessed land there is no distinction between the day and the night. The gods, whose robes serve them for wings, approach the supreme Buddha from all directions with wreathes of plomers, crowns of gems, jemelles umbrellas and flags in their hands. They and the Bodhisattvas wait round him like Parnett's saints\u2014\"With harps of gold, with boughs of ever green. With robes of white, the pions throngs are seen; Exalted anthems all their hours employ... And all is music and excess of joy.\"\n\nDivine lustre\u2014halos of light emanating from the persons of the saints and Buddhas keep all nature illumined. The hard soil becomes soft and yields to the feet, and the soft earth grows hard when the mind wishes for it.\n\nThere the food of contemplation furnishes nourishment to the residents of Sukh\u00e1vati. Their wealth consists of love and enjoyment, of meditation, their vestments are self grown on their person nor have they shame to cover. It is a land which is free from lust, envy, rage, ignorance and stupidity.\n\nOnce born there, one does not transmigrate elsewhere, but goes on ascending to the stages of sainthood. He is liberated from the effects of karma. The gods who in this world are subject to fall at the exhaustion of their moral merits\u2014may by dint of prayers have their births in Sukh\u00e1vati\u2014and draw near Amit\u00e1bha guided by his light. I here extract a few lines from the Dh\u00e1ra\u1e47i called \"the drum-sound of immortality.\"\nB\u00e1b\u00fa S. C.

B.\u2014Buddha, Amit\u00e2bha and Amit\u00e2yusa are the different manifestations of the same spiritual entity.\n\nCol. J. Waterhouse submitted a communication from Mr. W. McCarren, Manager of the Arakan Oil Company's works, Kyok Phyoo, and said:\n\nAt the August meeting, after the reading of Col. Mainwaring's paper on his new theory of the Barisal Guns I remarked that on reading a paper by Prof. Redwood on the Oil-wells of India, which was published last year in the Journal of the Society for Chemical Industry, and in which mention was made of gas explosions occurring in the Islands of Cheduba and Ramree from the mud volcanoes, it seemed not impossible that with favourable conditions of wind and atmosphere the sound of these explosions if loud enough might be carried across the Bay of Bengal so as to be heard in the localities where the Barisal Guns are heard.\n\nOn looking up a paper in Vol. XI of the Records of the Geological Survey of India, by Mr. Mallett on \"the Mud Volcanoes of Ramri and Cheduba,\" referred to by Prof. Redwood, I found it stated that these explosions of gas were said by the natives to be most frequent in the rainy season.\n\n* De-va-chan is the Tibetan of Sukh\u00e2vati.\nIt struck me, therefore, that the question might at any rate be worth enquiring into, and as I found that the Arakan Oil Company's works were established at Kyok Phyoo, on the island of Ramri, I asked my friend Mr. J. D. Maxwell, of Messrs. Kettlewell, Bullen and Co., the managing agents of the Company, to forward some questions on the subject to Mr. W. McCarren the manager of the works. This he kindly did, and I lately received the following note by Mr. McCarren, from which it will be seen that although the gas explosions referred to cannot possibly be the source of the sounds known as the Barisal Guns, the fact of similar sounds being heard on the Island as coming from the west at the commencement and end of the monsoon is interesting, and points to the sea as being in some way the place of origin of the sounds.\n\nIt may also be remarked that Prof. Pedler has very kindly had prepared for me some charts showing the direction of the winds at the head of the Bay during the Monsoon months, and from these it would appear that the winds are favourable to sounds being carried across from the Ramri Islands to the Sunderbunds, supposing that they were sufficiently loud.\n\nThe further information Mr. McCarren has kindly promised will be of interest, and the Society is much indebted to him for the trouble he has taken in the matter.\n\nNote by Mr. W. McCarren.\n\n1. Do explosions of gas occur from the mud volcanoes or from the petroleum wells in the islands of Ramri, Cheduba and the Borongas?\n\nExplosions of gas occur from the mud volcanoes of Ramri and Cheduba but not from the petroleum wells.\n\n2. If so, at what season of the year are they most frequent and are they accompanied by much noise, loud enough to be heard at a considerable distance?\n\nThere is only one volcano on these islands that has explosions of gas accompanied with much noise and flame. This volcano is in Cheduba and explodes once in every 6 to 8 months. I have heard the sound (which was not very loud) of the explosion at Kyonk Phyoo 40 miles north of the volcano. I have made enquiries at Akyab 100 miles north of the volcano, no one living there (Akyab) that I could find ever heard the sound of any explosion of the Cheduba volcano, although numbers have seen the flames of the eruptions which generally during the time (7 years) I have been here, have taken place at night time.\n3. What is the direction of the prevailing wind at the time when the explosions are the most frequent?\n   The wind was blowing from the N. W. when the last explosion occurred.\n\n4. Is the noise accompanying them sufficiently loud to be heard at a great distance; and is it possible that it could be heard on the other side of the Bay of Bengal?\n   From enquiries I have made, and the number of times I have heard the noise accompanying the explosion, I do not think the sound could be heard at over 70 miles.\n\nThe natives here tell me that in April and May near the commencement of the rains they hear three or four very loud reports coming from the west, i.e., the sea. That these reports are entirely different from the sounds produced by the surf on the coast, and are like the reports from the firing off of cannon. That in August and September near the end of the rains they hear the same sort of sounds which are again three or four in number,\u2014that during no other time of the year do they hear these sounds. They of course cannot tell what are the causes of these reports, but they think they are in connection with the beginning and ending of the rains.\n\nI have made arrangements with the headmen of the different villages along the coast, that when they hear these reports this year to come and give me the particulars. I will be on the qui vive myself and trust I will be able to get the exact date of each report.\n\nThe following paper was read:\n1. *Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula*, No. 3.

McCarren, Manager of the Arakan Oil Company's works, Kyauk Phyoo, and said:\n\nAt the August meeting, after the reading of Col. Mainwaring's paper on his new theory of the Barisal Guns I remarked that on reading a paper by Prof. Redwood on the Oil-wells of India, which was published last year in the Journal of the Society for Chemical Industry, and in which mention was made of gas explosions occurring in the Islands of Cheduba and Ramree from the mud volcanoes, it seemed not impossible that with favourable conditions of wind and atmosphere the sound of these explosions if loud enough might be carried across the Bay of Bengal so as to be heard in the localities where the Barisal Guns are heard.\n\nOn looking up a paper in Vol. XI of the Records of the Geological Survey of India, by Mr. Mallett on \"the Mud Volcanoes of Ramri and Cheduba,\" referred to by Prof. Redwood, I found it stated that these explosions of gas were said by the natives to be most frequent in the rainy season.\n\n* De-va-chan is the Tibetan of Sukh\u00e2vati.\nfurlough, they could not be determined till now. Of the 82 coins sent down, 79 were whole, and 3 broken.\n\nAll the 82 specimens are of one kind, and belong to the class, commonly called \"Indo-Sassanian.\" They are described and figured in Prinsep's Indian Antiquities (ed. Thomas), Vol. I, p. 407, Plate XXXIII, figs. 9, 14. Coins of this description have been found, at various times and in different localities, in large numbers. All collections are well supplied with them. They have been sent to the mint to be melted down.\n\nRev. H. B. Hyde exhibited a transcript of the Original Returns of Baptisms, Marriages and Burials received from Calcutta by the Court of Directors between 1713 and 1754.\n\nHe said:\u2014The Original Registers of the Presidency Church were destroyed in 1756 and since then until these transcripts were received last month, it has perhaps been quite unknown in Calcutta that such duplicates now copied were in existence. These transcripts are to be lodged in the Registry of St. John's Church.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. New and Rare Indian Lycenidae.\u2014By William Doherty, Cincinnati, U. S. A.

Prain.\n\nBarren Island has been so often described that there is little left to say concerning its physical condition. In his exhaustive account of the island (Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, xxi, part 4) Mr. Mallet has, however, suggested (l. c., p. 30) that future visitors should note \"the temperature of the hot spring\" at the landing place and \"the thickness of the fresh and undisturbed sulphur-crusts.\" This the writer, owing to the kindness of Col. T. Cadell, v. c., Chief Commissioner of the Andamans, had an opportunity of doing in April 1891.\nThe column of steam from the crater which was \"visible from the landing-place or even some distance out at sea\" to Mr. Mallet (l. c., p. 23) in February 1884 and was \"barely visible at 3 miles distance\" to Capt. A. Carpenter in 1886 (Records, Geol. Surv., India, xx, 48) was no longer visible from these points in April 1891; on ascending the cone, however, steam was found to issue still at the places indicated in Mr. Mallet's memoir. The most copious discharge was still from the solfatara on the inner aspect of the north side of the crater.\n\nA deposit of sulphur of an average thickness of 2\u00bd inches had been laid down on this solfatara since 1884. On the other solfataras far less had been deposited; the crusts on the two next largest\u2014that on the inner aspect of the south side of the crater and that outside the crater on the north-east face of the cone\u2014were but \u00bc in. to 1 inch thick. The new crusts were very similar to the old ones described by Mr. Mallet (l. c., p. 18) except as regards thickness; when pieces were removed, however, they were found to be looser in texture and more friable than the fragments of the old deposit that lay scattered about the crater and in estimating the present value of the solfataras as a sulphur-supply this should perhaps be taken into account. The temperature of the steam at the point of issue was not determined in 1891, but it can hardly be as hot now as in 1884\u2014it was then 219\u00b0 F.\u2014since there was no crevice in which it was impossible to place one's hand for at least a few seconds.\n\nIn taking the temperature of the hot spring Mr. McCausland, Commander of H. M. I. M. Nancowry very kindly assisted me. At high tide there was no trace of percolation of water through the shingle of the small landing-place beach, but when the tide had ebbed water was found to ooze through this shingle at five different points round the head of the bay. Having scooped out pools sufficiently deep for complete immersion of a thermometer at these spots we took temperatures in as nearly as possible the fashion described by Mr. Mallet (l. c., p. 26). In the most northerly small pool (furthest from the recent lava), the thermometer registered 102\u00b0 F.; in the next pool towards the lava, 103\u00b0 F.; then 104\u00b0 F.; then 106\u00b0 F.; finally in the pool nearest of all to the recent lava 104\u00b0 F.; Mr. Mallet found that in 1884 the temperature of the different springs increased with their proximity to the recent lava; the discrepancy of our results as regards the last pool and that next adjacent to it (which, though five yards further from the lava was nevertheless 2\u00b0 F. warmer) from the experience of Mr. Mallet led us to repeat the whole observation and to take the temperatures in these two last pools several times; our results were, however, the same\non each occasion. There appears to have been more water in the spring at the time of Mr. Mallet's visit (Feb.) than when our observations were made (April) for he found it possible to take temperatures in seven places while we could only do so in five.\n\nThis spring was formerly much hotter than it is now, but unfortunately the early observations are not at all definite: 'as hot almost as if it had been boiling' (commander of a vessel, 1832); 'temperature too high to be borne with the hand' (Playfair, 1837); 'natural boiling spring' (Mouat, 1857); 'nearly at the boiling point' (Liebig 1858); 'scalding hot' (Parish, 1862). The observations made since 1862 being more precise are here appended:\n\n| Date       | Temperature of Spring | Authority                                      |\n|------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| April, 1866 | 158\u00b0 F. and 163\u00b0 F.   | Andaman Committee, Report in Proc. As. Soc. Beng. 1866, p 213. |\n| March, 1873 | 130\u00b0 F. (highest observed) | Ball, Rec. Geol. Surv. India, vi, p. 87. |\n| February, 1884 | 106\u00b0\u2014116\u00b0 F.         | Mallet, Mem. Geol. Surv. India, xxi, pt. 4, p. 26. |\n| April, 1886  | 110\u00b0 F. (solitary observation) | Daley, Rec. Geol. Surv. India, xx, 48. |\n| April, 1891  | 102\u00b0\u2014106\u00b0 F.         | Prain.                                         |\n\nThe observations given in this table are not of quite equal value because they have not been taken on a uniform principle. The Andaman Committee above referred to (Dr. Gamseks, Lt. Laughton and Mr. Homfray) describe the spring accurately as issuing from underneath the lava across the small bay, but though Mr. Ball (l. c.) speaks of them as recording the temperature \"at from 158\u00b0 to 163\u00b0\" the statement in their report is that at low tide in one place the temperature was found to be 163\u00b0 F., and at another 158\u00b0 F. We cannot therefore be certain that these figures give either the maximum or the minimum temperature in 1866, though it is highly probable even if one of them represents a limit that they do not exhibit the full range of temperature at that time. Mr. Ball's observation is rather more precise; the highest temperature is given as 130\u00b0 F. taken close to high-water mark where the spring bubbles up; unfortunately he does not give the range of temperature in 1873. In connection with this it should be noted that Mr. A. O. Hume, speaking of this very observation, says\n(Stray Feathers ii, 104) \"the thermometer showed a temperature of nearly 140\u00b0 F.\" This remark occurs in the narrative portion of a paper on the ornithology of the islands of the Bay of Bengal and is clearly written from memory only; attention is drawn to it now merely in order to prevent any one who may subsequently read the statement from relying upon it as exact. Mr. Mallet's observations are very comprehensive and precise. Only the bare result of Mr. Daley's observation is given and only one temperature is mentioned: it is not stated that it was the highest, and it is possible that the temperature was taken at one spot only.\n\nThe rate of cooling of the spring as indicated by the various highest readings of the preceding table is shown in the table subjoined:\n\n| Period | No. of years | Amt. of cooling | Rate per annum |\n|--------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| 1866-73| 7            | 33\u00b0 F. or 18\u00b730\u00b0 C. | 4\u00b77\u00b0 F. or 2\u00b76\u00b0 C. |\n| 1873-84| 11           | 14\u00b0 F. or 7\u00b770\u00b0 C. | 1\u00b72\u00b0 F. or 0\u00b76\u00b0 C. |\n| 1884-86| 2            | 6\u00b0 F. or 3\u00b73\u00b0 C.   | 3\u00b70\u00b0 F. or 1\u00b77\u00b0 C. |\n| 1886-91| 5            | 4\u00b0 F. or 2\u00b72\u00b0 C.   | 0\u00b78\u00b0 F. or 0\u00b74\u00b0 C. |\n\nThe rates per annum shew that the existence of an error in the 1886 observation is not only possible but highly probable; the spot selected for examination can hardly have been that in which the temperature was highest at the time. If it be neglected the rate per annum for the whole 1884-91 period is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or 1\u00b74\u00b0 F. (=0\u00b77\u00b0 C.) a rate that, allowing for errors unavoidable in such observations, is practically uniform with that during the 1873-84 period. Between 1866 and 1873 it cooled nearly four times as fast as it has cooled since; if the 1886 observation is correct, six times as fast as it is cooling now. If the rate continues uniform henceforth the spring will, if the 1886 observation be correct, probably cease to deserve the appellation \"hot\" by 1925, if the 1886 observation was not taken where the water was hottest at the time, the spring will probably be cool by 1910.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in April last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

C. Cotes, Esq., T. R. Munro, Esq., J. D. Nimmo, Esq., R. D. Oldham, Esq., W. L. Sclater, Esq., Dr. J. H. Tull Walsh.\nVisitor:\u2014Thomas H. Holland, Esq.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThirty-three presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen, duly proposed and seconded at the last meeting of the Society were ballotted for and elected Ordinary Members.\nRev. D. G. Lathom-Browne.\nF. A. Shillingford, Esq.\n\nThe following gentleman is a candidate for election at the next meeting:\u2014\nThomas H. Holland, Esq., Geological Survey of India, proposed by R. D. Oldham, Esq., seconded by W. L. Sclater, Esq.\n\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following members:\u2014\nJohn Boxwell, Esq., C. S.\nC. W. Baumgarten, Esq.\nThe President announced that Dr. J. H. Tull Walsh had been elected a member of Council in the room of Dr. D. D. Cunningham, resigned, in consequence of proceeding to Europe on furlough.\n\nMr. W. L. Slater exhibited an old breech-loading gun, which was dug up in the Gya district and was presented to the Indian Museum by Mr. F. Field; the gun had been examined by Col. Mortimer, R. A., of the Ordnance Department, Fort William, who pronounces it to be of European manufacture probably dating from the 16th century, and that it was known by the name of Perrier or Paterera.\n\nMr. E. C. Cotes exhibited two insects which are amongst the causes now conspiring to prevent the continuance of the locust plague through another year.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Note on a fiery hot-blast in the district of Khuln'a, on the 12th May, 1891.\u2014By H. James Rainey. Communicated by the Natural History Secretary.\n\nWhile my brother, Mr. J. Rudd-Rainey, and I were at dinner on the 12th May last, in the centre room of \"Rainey Villa,\" between the hours of 8 and 9 o'clock, a very cool wind which was blowing into the room through the south door from the south-east direction quite suddenly changed to an absolutely warm blast from the same quarter, and was accompanied by a clearly discernible smell of combustion. So great was the heat, and so strong the smell of burning even within the room, that I immediately left it and went to the south verandah to see if there was any thatched house on fire close to the brick-built building I was in. I found no sign of any conflagration anywhere in the horizon, but the warm blast outside became absolutely fiery in its intensity. I could barely face it, and that only for a minute or so at a time. I may describe the sensation I felt to be similar to that of standing in close proximity to a heated furnace, or near to and windward of a burning expanse of jungle. This fiery hot-blast continued to blow for about the space of a quarter of an hour, and then the wind suddenly veered to the opposite direction, that is, from south-east to south-west, and a cool breeze set in, which was very grateful, indeed. The sky was overcast with clouds, but of no great density, and some stars were visible here and there, though none of the seven bright stars constituting the constellation Ursa Major, or even the pole star. There was much display of electricity in the shape of vivid flashes of lightning in different directions, but especially from the south-east quarter.\nI regret exceedingly that I omitted to consult the thermometer at the time, to note the degree of the temperature when exposed to the intensely hot blast. From the result of enquiries instituted by me among my tenants and others, the fiery hot blast appears to have extended to a radius of several miles of my residence, which, I may state, is situated in Khuln\u00e1 Proper, on the left bank or east side of the wide river Rupsh\u00e1h\u00e1, on the opposite or west side of which river stands the present Civil Station of Khuln\u00e1, and within half a mile distance from it.\n\nI have never before this occurrence experienced anywhere in India, or elsewhere, such a strange intensely hot blast, and cannot in any way satisfactorily account for it. As the subject may be of some interest to Meteorologists, perhaps it would be worth while to fully discuss and elucidate it. I may add that, I find from the Centenary Review of the Society, that in Jour. As. Soc., B., Vol. XVII, 1848, there appears a paper on this subject from the veteran Meteorologist H. Piddington, entitled \"A Notice of a remarkable Hot Wind in the Zillah of Purneal,\" but owing to the destruction of my Library I am unable to refer to it.\n\n2. The 'Tsam-chh\u00f4-dung' (rtsa-mchhog-grong) of the Lamas, and their very erroneous identification of the site of Buddha's death.\u2014By L. A. WADDELL, M. B.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n---\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in May last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBombay.

W. Croft, K.C.I.E., President, in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle, Rev. H. B. Hyde, W. H. Jobbins, Esq., Dr. W. King, C. Little, Esq., B\u00e1b\u00fa Asutosh Mukhop\u00e1dhy\u00e1y, L. de Nio\u00e9ville, Esq., W. L. Solater, Esq., Pandit Hara Pras\u00e1d Sh\u00e1stri, C. H. Tawney, Esq., Dr. J. H. Tull Walsh, C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nVisitor:\u2014Dr. E. Thurston.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nForty-two presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen are candidates for election at the next meeting:\u2014\n\nH. C. Mallik, Esq., Calcutta, proposed by Hon. Sir A. W. Croft, seconded by C. Little, Esq.\n\nDr. E. H. Brown, Civil Surgeon, Puri, proposed by B\u00e1b\u00fa Man Mohan Chakravarti, seconded by C. Little, Esq.\n\nDr. M. A. Stein, Principal, Government College, Lahore, proposed by Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle, seconded by C. Little, Esq.\n\nDiego Ernst, Esq., Delhi, proposed by W. L. Sclater, Esq., seconded by Dr. W. King.\n\nDr. Edgar Thurston, Superintendent, Government Central Museum, Madras, proposed by Dr. W. King, seconded by W. L. Sclater, Esq.\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following member:\u2014\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, LL. D., C. I E.\n\nThe President observed:\u2014It is with great regret that I have to make to the Society the formal announcement of the death of one of its most distinguished members, R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra. It is not only within the walls of this Society, or even in Bengal, that his loss will be deplored; it will be felt throughout Europe; for wherever learning is cultivated, there the name of R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra is held in honour. His connection with this Society, extending over nearly half a century, was of a quite exceptional character. Entering it, when a young man, as Assistant-Secretary and Librarian, his commanding abilities and untiring industry soon brought him into prominence; and while we may congratulate ourselves that it was this Society which first gave him the opportunity of satisfying his inexhaustible craving for knowledge, we must gratefully admit that he has amply repaid the debt by the contributions that he has made to Oriental learning, and by the lustre that his name and attainments have shed upon the Society, of which he was one of the most distinguished in the long roll of Presidents.\n\nI will only add that the Council at its last meeting passed the following Resolution:\u2014\n\n\"The Council desire to place on record their deep sense of the very great loss the Asiatic Society of Bengal and Oriental Learning have sustained by the death of their former President and Vice-President, R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, and to express their great sorrow at the sad event that has deprived the Society of a most learned and distinguished supporter who has been closely connected with it for nearly half a century, and the Council of a much esteemed Colleague.\"\n\nThe President read the following letter:\u2014\n\nNo. 357.\n\nTo\n\nThe Secretary, Asiatic Society, Bengal.\n\nSimla, the 26th June, 1891.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to state for the information of the Bengal Asiatic Society that Lieutenant-Colonel H. H. Godwin-Austen's work on the land and fresh water Mollusca of India and surrounding countries, a\ncopy of which has already been forwarded for the use of the Society, was intended to be supplementary to Messrs. Theobald and Hanley's \"Conchologia Indica,\" but it is unfortunately unfinished, though complete in itself so far as it goes. In connection with the publication of the \"Fauna of British India\" it has been suggested to the Government of India that, on completion of the present series of seven volumes relating to the Vertebrata, the work should be extended so as to comprise the Invertebrata as well, and this proposal has been recommended for the favourable consideration of the Secretary of State. As, however, the following up of Colonel Godwin-Austen's work must be a necessary preliminary to any adequate treatment of the subject in the proposed extension of the Fauna Indica series, I am to enquire whether any person connected with the Asiatic Society would be willing to continue the researches so ably begun by Colonel Godwin-Austen.\n\nI have &c.,\n\n(Signed) P. G. Melitus,\nUnder-Secy. to the Govt. of India.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following reports on finds of Treasure Trove Coins:\n\n1. Report on 232 Silver coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Jabalpur, with his No. 1941, dated 6th May, 1891.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner's letter states that they were found buried, but no particulars as to where, when and how they were discovered are given.\n\nAll the coins are Moghuls, and belong to the following emperors of Delhi:\n\n1. Akbar, 963\u20141014 A.H. = 1556\u20141605 A.D.\n   - round jal jal\u00e1l rupees of the Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d mint ...... 2\n2. Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, 1014\u20141037 A.H. = 1605\u20141627 A.D.\n   - round rupees of several varieties ...................... 6\n3. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, 1037\u20141068 A.H. = 1627\u20141658 A.D.\n   - a, type: square areas, 4 varieties ..................... = 55\n   - b, type: round areas, 4 varieties ...................... = 8\n   - c, type: lettered surfaces, 4 varieties ................. = 12 75\n4. Aurangz\u00e9b, 1068\u20141118 A.H. = 1658\u20141707 A.D.\n   - a, type: badr mun\u00edr, 3 varieties ....................... = 128\n   - b, type: mihr mun\u00edr, .................................. = 17\n   - c, type: Abul Muqaffar .................................. = 4\n   - d, type: reversed writing ............................... = 2 149\n\nTotal ... 232\nThe earliest of these coins is dated in the 40th year of Akbar, that is 1596 A.D., the latest is dated in the 30th year of Aurangzib, that is, 1687 A.D. They cover a period of nearly one century, and they must have been buried not long after the year 1687 A.D., in the place where they were dug up.\n\nAmong them there are several of considerable interest, especially among the rupees of Aurangzib; thus those of the *badr munir* type. Rupees of this description are not common; they appear to have been only minted in Akbarnagar, Zafarabad and Multan. I am not certain as to the identity of the two first-named places; but Akbarnagar is said to be an old name of Rajmahal. In the present collection there are 17 rupees of this description; 15 of these are of the Akbarnagar mint, of the following years 1071, 1072, 1079, 1082, 1084, 1090, 1093, 1095; both years, that of the Hijrah as well as that of the reign, are shown on the reverse; while the usual practice is, to give the Hijrah on the obverse, but the reign on the reverse. One rupee is of the Zafarabad and one of the Multan mint; both of the same year, viz., Hijrah 1080 on the obverse, and regnal 12 on the reverse. Another peculiar rupee of Aurangzib is that which gives the obverse legend: *Muhammad Aurangzeb Bahadur Alamgir Badshah Ghazi* or *Muhammad Muhud-din Abu-l-Muzaffar Bahadur Alamgir Badshah Ghazi*. Of this description there are four coins. Their mint is illegible; their dates are 1069 *abad*, 1080-3, 1081-3, 1082-4; the years are disposed, as usual, on the obverse and reverse. Another curiosity are two rupees of Aurangzib which bear the usual legends but in reversed characters, so that they may be read if held against a mirror. The characters are rather crude; the mint is not legible, the year of the reign is either 22 or 27, that of the Hijrah is 109*. Coins of this description, might of course, be struck from ordinary rupees.\n\nII. Report on 116 old coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Sagar, with his No. 1708, dated the 14th May, 1891.\n\nThese coins are stated to have been found in the village waste of Raigawan, in the Rhurai Tahsil of the Sagar District, by boys who were tending cattle.\n\nThey are all silver coins and consist of 63 Pathan, 50 Gujarati and 3 other coins: distributed as follows:\n\nI, Pathan Coins (Rupees):\n\nof Sher Shah, 947\u2014952 A.H. = 1540\u20141545 A.D.\n\na, type: square areas, single-lined, as in Chronicles, No. 351, two varieties ........................................... 22\n\nb, type: square areas, single-lined as in Chronicles, Nos. 344, 352, three varieties .................................. 24\nc, type: square areas, single-lined, new variety ........ 2\nd, type: square areas, double-lined, as in Chronicles, 346, 354, two varieties................................. 6\ne, type: round areas, single-lined, as in Indian Antiquary, vol.

Report on six old silver coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Jalandar, with his No. 752, dated 12th June, 1891.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner's letter merely states that 39 coins were found buried in the Jalandar district, but no particulars are given as to the exact place and time of discovery.\n\nThose 39 coins are stated to have comprised 4 of Aurangz\u00e9b, 2 of Farrukh Siyar and 33 of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h, all three Moghul emperors of Delhi, reigning between 1658 and 1748 A.D., a period of nearly one century. The coins accordingly were probably buried during the troubles of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h's invasion of India.\n\nFrom among the 39 coins, 6 only were sent down to be examined and reported on, two of each kind. These were found to be of very common descriptions.\n\nIV. Report on fifty old rupees forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Wardha, with his No. 3424, dated 3rd July 1891.\nThese old rupees are stated by the Deputy Commissioner to have been found buried in an earthen pot, when the foundations were being dug for additions to a small temple of B\u00e1la\u00ed at Waigaoa, a village about ten miles south of Wardha. They are supposed to have been buried by the family of the Bhagat or attendant of that temple, because they were found on the site of a former dwelling-house of theirs, and the family have been Bhagats of the temple for three generations.\n\nThe find comprises rupees of the following emperors of Delhi:\n\n1. Sh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n, A. D. 1627\u20141658 5 rupees.\n2. Aurangz\u00e9b, A. D. 1658\u20141707 19 \"\"\n3. Farrukh Siy\u00e1h, A. D. 1712\u20141719 3 \"\"\n4. Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h, A.

D. 1754\u20141769 2 \"\"\n\nTotal ... 50 Rupees.\n\nAll these rupees are in a very bad condition and belong to very common descriptions. Possibly a few of the coins ascribed to Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h may belong to his successor Ahmad Sh\u00e1h (A. D. 1748\u20141754).\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited eight gold Gupta coins, belonging to Mr. Rivett-Carnac, and remarked as follows:\n\n\"Four of these coins belong to Chandra Gupta II, who reigned from about 395\u2014415 A. D., and four to Kum\u00e1ra Gupta I, who reigned from 415\u2014454 A. D. (see in J. A. S. B., Vol. LVIII, Pt. I, my synchronistic table). Of the coins of Chandra Gupta one is of the Couch type (see Smith\u2019s Catalogue in the Journal R. A. S., p. 76). This is an extremely rare type. Hitherto only one specimen was known. The present (second) specimen affords some new information. The king\u2019s upraised right hand is not empty, but holds a flower (lotus?), and he sits on a high-backed couch. The legend on the left margin (facing the king) is fully legible and reads \u0926\u0947\u0935 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f\u0930\u0915 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u091a, and on the right margin (behind the king) it continues all round the rim, but unfortunately only \u091a\u0942\u0930\u0941 is just legible. Thus much was already known; it is deva \u015ar\u012b Mah\u00e1r\u0101j\u00f1idhir\u00e1ja \u015ar\u012b Chandra Gupta. The vowel-marks of the long \u00e1 were probably originally on the coin, and are merely worn away. The (hitherto illegible) characters below the conch are quite distinct and read clearly \u0930\u0941\u092a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u093f r\u00fapa-kriti, i.e., \u2018he who is clever in dramatic composition.\u2019 Above the akshara v pa, but quite detached from it, there is a small horizontal stroke. The meaning of it I do not know; but it is certainly not any vowel-mark; perhaps it owes its presence to a mere fault in the die. The word r\u00fapa may mean either \u2018sculp-\nture, figure' or 'dramatic composition;' and the compound r\u016bpa-k\u1e5biti may mean either 'who is clever in the making of figures' or 'who is clever in the making of dramas or dramatic representations.' I prefer taking the word in the latter sense, because it is not quite uncommon to hear of kings in ancient India being dramatic authors. The well-known drama, called the M\u1e5b\u012bchohhaka\u1e6dik\u0101, is ascribed by tradition to a king S\u016bdraka. Still more to the point is the discovery by Prof. F. Kielhorn, of a drama composed by the Chauhan king Vigrah\u0101jadeva of S\u0101kambhar\u012b (see Indian Antiquary, Vol. XX, p. 201), in the middle of the 12th century A.D. This drama was inscribed on a stone slab, which has been found in Ajmir; and Prof. Kielhorn rightly says with reference to it, that 'actual and undoubted proof is here afforded to us of the fact that powerful Hind\u016b rulers of the past were eager to compete with K\u0101lid\u0101sa and Bhavabh\u016bti for poetical fame.' It appears to me, that this coin of Chandra Gupta's shows that this king also laid claim to the honour of dramatic authorship. The reverse is rather poorly preserved; the legend is \u015ar\u012b Vikrama with double kk.\n\nAnother of the Chandra Gupta coins is of the Lion Trampler type. This is also a rare type; there are four varieties, of which the second and third varieties are known only by one specimen each; the first and fourth are not quite so rare. The present specimen belongs to the fourth variety. It is a poor specimen, the legends being almost entirely wanting on both sides.\n\nThe third coin of Chandra Gupta is of the Horseman to Right type. Its reverse is good, but the legend on the obverse is nearly gone; only parama-bhaga .... ndra-gupta\u1e25 being preserved; the legend commences in front of the king's head, running all round the rim and terminating behind his head.\n\nThe fourth coin of Chandra Gupta belongs to the Horseman to Left type. Of this type there exist two varieties; one, which is not very rare, has the reverse legend ajita vikrama; the present coin belongs to this variety. The obverse legend is entirely gone.\n\nOf the Kum\u0101ra Gupta coins one belongs to the Archer type and the Variety II, A. It is not an uncommon variety, and the present coin is a rather poor specimen, the legends on both sides being almost entirely gone.\n\nThe three other coins of Kum\u0101ra Gupta are all of the Horseman to Right type. Of this type there exist three varieties, of which the first and third are not uncommon, while the second is very rare. Among the three coins there is one of the second variety, showing on the reverse a goddess sitting on a wicker-stool, stooping forward, with\nher left hand resting on her hip, and holding an open flower in her right. The obverse legend on this variety has never been read; nor does the present specimen afford much help; only \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0925\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0924\u093e\u0932\u092e\u094d-\u092a\u0930\u093e prithv\u012bt\u0101l\u0101m-par\u0101 can be read, apparently about one-third of the entire legend. The two other specimens belong to the third variety which shows the same goddess feeding a peacock with her right, while in her left she holds a lotus-flower. One is a rather poor specimen, with nearly the entire legend lost. The other is much better, and apparently preserves the entire legend, in the following, somewhat curious form: \u091a\u093f\u0924\u093f (read \u091a\u093f\u0924\u093f) \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0925\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0924\u093e\u0932\u092e\u094d-\u092a\u0930\u093e \u091c\u092f\u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 Kshitipatir ajito vi[jaya-Kum\u0101ra]. Gu. The portion enclosed in brackets is mutilated, the rest is perfect. The legend commences with kshi on the right hand margin, between the king's head and the horse's neck; it closes with gu close behind the king's head. There is no space for the complementary aksharas \u0923\u0903 ptah. The form of the legend, therefore, is here shorter than usual.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited a Buddhist chaitya of bronze, which was purchased by the Society from its finder through B\u00e1b\u00fa Tarakhn\u00e1th Roy. It is said to have been found together with two inscribed copper-plates several years ago at the village of Ashrafpur, near Raipur, in the Dacca district, during the process of levelling a mound in the neighbourhood of a tank. One of the copper-plate inscriptions was published by Dr. Mitra, as long ago as 1885 (see Proceedings of that year, for March, p. 49). The other copper-plate was purchased by the Society last year from the finder, a villager named M\u00edr Kh\u00e1n. It was also being prepared for publication by Dr. Mitra, and will now be published by myself. Both inscriptions are dated in the same year, viz., Samvat 13; the first in Vai\u015b\u0101kha 13, the other in Paushadha 25. There is nothing in the inscriptions to determine to which era the date 13 should be referred. From the shape of the characters, which is that of the so-called Ku\u1e6dila, the inscriptions may be referred to the eighth or ninth century or perhaps somewhat later. The New\u00e1r era of Nep\u00e1l, which commences with 880 A.D., might fit the date; and it would then be equivalent to 893 A.D. But this may be left to further determination, hereafter, when the copper-plates are published. It may be noted, however, that the date was wrongly read by Dr. Mitra in 1885, as being Samvat 713. What he read as the numeral 7, is really the final consonant t of Samvat; and the two other symbols are not those for 1 and 3, but for 10 and 3. The symbols are those of the older numeral system of notation, which had separate signs for the units, tens, hundreds, etc., and which was still employed in India for epigraphical purposes as late as the eighth and ninth centuries of the\nChristian era. In Nep\u00e1l it held its ground for a much longer time. The chaitya having been found with the inscriptions is of undoubtedly the same age, and may date from the ninth century. The mound in which the objects were found would seem to mark the ruined site of a Buddhist's shrine. The chaitya is of bronze, and fairly well preserved; it is made of three stories, built up in pyramidal form, consisting of a high, slightly sloping, square basement, on which rises a tall cylindrical dome, surmounted by a small square turret with projecting roof. See Plate III. The whole was originally surmounted by two, or perhaps three, umbrellas of which, however, only the lowermost is preserved. Under this umbrella, attached to its pole, is a minute plate inscribed with the Buddhist creed in (now) illegible characters. The four sides of the turret are adorned with four sitting figures of Buddha, projecting from the walls. Three are in the witnessing and one in the meditating posture. Four other figures are placed round the body of the dome, exactly below the upper figures, within ornamental niches, which are connected with one another with bands and festoons. The basement bears, on each of its four sides, three sitting figures (twelve in all); each triad consisting of one male between two female figures. The figures round the dome probably represent Bodhisattvas, while the basement figures appear to be Buddhist devas and saktis. The chaitya, therefore, already represents Buddhism in the much depraved Tantrik form, in which it was current in Bengal at the time of its extinction.\n\nMr. C. H. Tawney called attention to Plate XXXIII, fig. 4, in General Cunningham's Bharhut Sculptures, and said, I think that this scene represents the story contained in the 407th J\u00e1taka, Fausb\u00f6ll's edition.\n\nIt is called the Mah\u00e1kapij\u00e1taka, and the story is as follows:\n\nWhen Brahmadatta was king in Benares, the Bodhisattva was at the head of a troop of eighty thousand monkeys. They used to eat the fruits of a mango-tree on the banks of the Ganges. The Bodhisattva took particular care to prevent the fruits of one branch that overhung the Ganges, from falling into the river. In spite of all his precautions one fruit came into the hands of king Brahmadatta, when enjoying himself in the Ganges, and he asked the foresters whence it came. They at once said, that the tree that bore this fruit was to be found in the neighbourhood of the Him\u00e1layas. The king took them as guides, and with a large retinue, ascended the river in rafts, and after disembarking, and eating to his fill of the fruits of the tree, he lay down to rest.\n\nIn the night the eighty thousand monkeys came and began to\nplunder the tree. The king woke up and saw them. He then stationed archers all round the tree with their arrows ready on the string, and told them to let none of the monkeys escape, asserting his intention of breakfasting the next morning off monkey-flesh and mangoes. The monkeys, being terrified, came trembling to the Bodhisattva their king. He told them not to be afraid, as he would save their lives. He then sprang across the Ganges, alighted in a thicket, picked out a creeper, made it smooth, and fastened it to his body. Unfortunately he miscalculated the length of the creeper, not allowing for the portion, that was to pass round his own body. He then made one end of the creeper fast to a tree, and sprang towards the other bank, where he had left his subjects terrified on the mango-tree. Owing to his having miscalculated the required length, he had to catch hold of the mango-tree with his arms. In this position he made a sign to the monkeys to pass over his body, and escape to the other bank. They did so, but Devadatta, who was among the monkeys, and saw an opportunity of injuring his enemy, climbed up to a lofty branch, and sprang with all his force on to the Bodhisattva\u2019s back, thus injuring his heart, which is said to have been \u201csplit.\u201d\n\nIt appears to me that so much of the story is clearly represented in the Bharhut Sculpture. The king of the monkeys is seen holding on to the mango-tree. A monkey has just crossed his body, and is crossing the creeper. Another is descending the tree on the other bank. Between the two trees flows a river containing three fish and one tortoise. Many monkeys are seen on the mango-tree. At the top of the mango-tree is seen a monkey with his paws so placed as to make his spring on to the back of the monkey-king as harmful as possible.\n\nThis monkey I take to be Devadatta, and I think a comparison of his face with the faces of the other monkeys will show that the artist has succeeded in imparting a particularly malignant expression to it.\n\nThe latter part of the story is not clearly represented in the picture. According to the J\u00e1taka, the king, after taking most tender care of the monkey-king, made him lie down, and sitting himself on a low seat, listened to his sermon on the duty of a good king. But in General Cunningham\u2019s photograph, the monkey-king appears to be sitting on a stool a little higher than that of the human king. I take it, that the artist has followed a slightly different version of the tale. The king appears to be expressing his admiration for the courage and self-devotion of the monkey-king. The rectangular object brought by two men is supposed by General Cunningham to be a mat. It may be intended for the monkey-king to lie down on. As soon as the monkey-king had finished his sermon on the duty of a king, he died of the blow given by the monkey Devadatta.\nAfter his death the king sent for his ministers, and had a pyre prepared containing a hundred cart-loads of wood. He ordered his wives to attend the funeral clad in red garments, with dishevelled hair, and torches in their hands. After the body was buried, he preserved the skull, and had it worshipped for seven days by the people of Benares on his return. He then erected a chaitya over it, and honoured it with perfumes and garlands as long as he lived.\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1. Lamaic Rosaries: their Kinds and Uses.\u2014By L. A.

King, B.A., in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\nB\u00e1bu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s, The Most Rev. Dr. Paul Goethals, Rev. H. B. Hyde, C. Little, Esq., Kum\u00e1r Ramesw\u00e1r Mali\u00e1h, T. R. Munro, Esq., J. D. Nimmo, Esq., W. L. Sclater, Esq., C. H. Tawney, Esq., C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nVisitor:\u2014Dr. W. W. Sheppard.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nOne Hundred and Thirty-seven presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe Secretary reported that the following gentlemen had been elected Ordinary Members of the Society during the recess, in accordance with Rule 7:\u2014\n\nH. C. Mallik, Esq.\nDr. E. H. Brown.\nDr. M. A. Stein.\nDiego Ernst, Esq.\nEdgar Thurston, Esq.\n\nThe following gentleman is a candidate for election at the next meeting:\u2014\n\nA. Mervyn Smith, Esq., C.E., F.S.A., proposed by W. H. Miles, Esq., seconded by Dr. W. King.\nThe following gentleman has expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society:\n\nW. H. Lee, Esq., C. S.\n\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following member:\n\nSurgeon-Major A. Barclay, I. M. S.\n\nThe President read the following obituary notice:\n\nSurgeon-Major A. Barclay, an active member of this Society, died of typhoid fever at Simla on the 2nd August. He was only 39 years of age. His loss is deeply regretted by his own service and it is intended to perpetuate his memory by means of some permanent monument. In a public letter the present Surgeon General with the Government of India says of Dr. Barclay, who was his Secretary:\u2014\u201cNo one can know as I do how much the service is indebted to Barclay. On all occasions, when questions affecting its welfare came up for discussion, his first thought was for the preservation of the honor and dignity of it as a body, and for the safe-guarding of the interests of individual members. In this, for a man ordinarily kindly, gentle and dispassionate, he was fearless in giving expression to his views and never hesitated to put them forward in forcible language.\u201d This is high but well deserved praise. To us Dr. Barclay\u2019s work as a member of this Society is of the greatest interest. His general knowledge was wide, but his leisure time was specially devoted to the study of parasitic fungi of the order Uredineae. Upon subjects connected with these fungi Dr. Barclay published eight papers in the Scientific Memoirs by officers of the Indian Medical Service; seven papers in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and others in the Annals of Botany, The Journal of Botany, The Transactions of the Linnean Society and in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. He was a good draughtsman and photo-micrographer and most of his papers were accompanied by excellent plates. It will be seen therefore that Dr. Barclay was an untiring worker and apart from the purely scientific interest attached to his writings he will be remembered as one who has done well by shewing the public the nature of fungi destructive to crops and by suggesting remedies. It was intended to send Dr. Barclay to the South of India to investigate the Coffee disease, an undertaking which would have been full of interest to him and to the scientific world and of benefit to the coffee planters. His last scientific work, before his death, was connected with the Leprosy Commission, whose report will soon appear and we may rest assured that his contributions to the work will be found marked by that energy and honesty which was so characteristic of the man.\nThe Philological Secretary read the following reports on finds of Treasure Trove Coins:\n\nI. Report on 213 old Rupees forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Mult\u00e1n, with his No. 550, dated the 13th August, 1890.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner's letter states that at the end of August 1889 a vessel containing 400 rupees of some ancient mintage was found by two men in a field. Of these 187 rupees were melted down by the finders, before proceedings could be taken under the Treasure Trove Act. The balance of 213 rupees was forwarded to me for identification and report. Their value is stated to be Rs. 217 according to the current coinage.\n\nOf these 213 rupees, 178 are Mughal, and 33 Afghan, one is a Persian and one a Sikh coin. They are mostly in fair condition.\n\nThey are classified as follows:\n\nI. MUGHAL RUPEES.\n\n1. Aurangz\u00e9b: 1068\u20141118 A. H. = A.

Collector of Chittagong in his report on these coins to the Commissioner of the Chittagong division states they were found somewhere in the village of 'Joogkhalla,' in Thannah 'Fattickaurry.' The date of the finding could not be ascertained.\n\nAll the coins are rupees of English mintage, such as were coined between 1793 and 1818, under the Regulations of 1793, in Calcutta and the subordinate mints of the Bengal Presidency. They are known as \"19th san\" Rupees, nominally from the Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, but really from the Calcutta mint, recognisable by their oblique milling.\n\nIII. Report on 15 old silver coins, forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Rawalpindi, with his No. 913G, dated 1st June 1891.\n\nThe coins are stated by the Deputy Commissioner to have been found in the Fateh Jang Tahsil; no further particulars are given.\n\nThey comprise 5 Mughal, 9 Durr\u00e1n\u00ed and one Sikh rupees, and are classified as follows:\n\nI, Mughal Rupees:\u2014\n1, Farrokh Siyar, ordinary type, .................................. 1\n2, Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h, Sahib Qir\u00e1n type, .......................... 4\n\nTotal Mughal ... 5\n\nII, Durr\u00e1n\u00ed Rupees:\u2014\n1, Taim\u00far Sh\u00e1h, 1187\u20141207 A.

Report on 29 old silver coins, forwarded by the Offg. Collector of Pubna, with his No. 372, dated 15th June 1891, and No. 561, dated 28th July 1891.\n\nThe exact locality of the find of these coins is not stated in the Collector's letter; they are supposed to have been found sometime in February or March 1891. Some more coins appear to have been found, but broken and melted into bars by the finders. Their value is stated to be about Rs. 32-8.\n\nThe coins include 4 of Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns of Delhi and 24 of the so-called Independent Sult\u00e1ns of Bengal. They may be classified as follows:\n\nI, Path\u00e1n Rupees:\n1, She\u00e9 Sh\u00e1h, 947\u2014952 A. H. = 1540\u20141545 A.

Report on 792 old copper coins forwarded by the Offg. Collector of Monghyr, with his No. 721R, dated the 1st August 1891.\n\nThe coins are stated to have been found in January 1889, buried in the garden of Hazari Shah\u00fa of Mouza Bargazar, Parg\u00e1n\u00e1 Salim\u00e1b\u00e1d, outpost Lakh\u00ed Sarai.\n\nA very large number of the coins are not in a sufficiently good state of preservation to be fully identified; but they all belong to the coinage of the Sult\u00e1ns of Jaunpur, and to the so-called \"second size\" of their copper coins, as described in the Catalogue of the British Museum on the Coins of the Muhammadan States of India, p. 89. Of these copper coins, there are two types: one with simple lettered surfaces, the other with a circular area on the reverse. The former is a very common type; the latter is rather rare. The coins, under review, all belong to the common type. Four of them together weigh 1\u00bd tol\u00e1, and six of them are equal to one anna, or each of them is equal to 2 pice (1 pice = \u00bc anna).\n\nThose specimens, that I have been able to identify, are thus distributed:\n\n1, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, called Sharq\u00ed, A.

No. 327, ... 59\n\nTotal ... 280\n\nUnserviceable coins:\u2014\n\nGrand total ... 792\n\nMr. C. H. Tawney read the following note:\u2014\n\nI do not think attention has ever been drawn to the fact that in Indian tales the royal dignity is often described as bestowed by lot. At any rate this appears to have frequently taken place, when a king died without leaving male issue. In the Katha Sarit Sagara, Taranga 65, we read that it was the custom in a certain country, when the king died, to turn loose an elephant, and any man that he took up with his trunk, and placed on his back, was anointed king.\n\nIn the Katha Kosha, a collection of edifying tales written in Jaina Sanskrit, an excellent manuscript of which has been kindly lent to me by the Principal of the Sanskrit College, a slightly different method is described. We read in the story of Devapala, the second story in this work, that the king of a certain city died of cholera, and left no male issue. \"As there was no son to succeed him, the ministers appointed an elephant, and fastened to its temples a pitcher of water, and let it go. It found the servant, named Devapala, asleep under a pipal-tree, and emptied the pitcher on his head. They bestowed on him the kingdom.\"\n\nIn this way the servant was rewarded for showing devotion to a stone image of the Jina, that he found in a river.\n\nIn the story of Amaradatta and Mitranaanda, the 20th story in the Katha Kosha, we find the following account given of the election of a king at Pataliputra:\n\n\"Now it happened that the king of that city died in the course of the night, without leaving issue. Then the ministers had recourse to the five ordeals, (divyani). The mighty elephant came into the garden outside the city. There the elephant sprinkled prince Amaradatta and put him on his back. Then the horse neighed. The two chowries fanned the prince. An umbrella was held over his head. A divine voice was heard in the air, 'Long live king Amaradatta.'\"\n\nIt happens that in this particular case the person chosen was by birth a prince, and was roaming about incognito. But this is merely a piece of folk-lore justice.\nThe above extract may be supported by another from the tale of V\u012br\u0101ngada and Sumitra, which is an episode in the tale of Ratnasikha, the 69th in the Kath\u0101 Ko\u015ba. It runs as follows:\n\n\"The king of the city of Mah\u0101s\u0101la died without a son. Then the barons had recourse to the five ordeals of the elephant, the horse, and so on. The elephant came into the city park trumpeting. Then he sprinkled the prince, named V\u012br\u0101ngada, with the water of inauguration, and taking him up in his trunk, placed him on his forehead, (kumbha-sthala). All the barons, and the chief ministers, and the other ministers, and the crowd with them bowed before the king, and exclaimed 'Long live the king!'\"*\n\nThe five ordeals are described even more clearly in a passage in the story of M\u016bladeva, the eighth in Professor Jacobi's \"Erz\u00e4hlungen in Mah\u0101r\u0101shtr\u012b,\" or \"Tales in Mah\u0101r\u0101shtr\u012b Pr\u0101krit.\"\n\nThe story is said by the editor to be taken from Devendra's Commentary on the Uttar\u0101dhyayana S\u016btra. The passage may be thus translated:\n\n\"At this juncture the king of the city died without leaving a son. They then had recourse to the five ordeals, (or instruments of selection, Pr\u0101krit divvini). These roamed about in the city, and went outside it. They came to M\u016bladeva. He was found sleeping in the shade of the champaka-tree. On seeing him the elephant trumpeted, and the horse neighed: he was sprinkled by the pitcher and fanned by the chowries, and the umbrella stood over him.\"\n\nIt is remarkable in this connexion that Darius, son of Hystaspes, is said to have been chosen king of the Persians owing to the neighing of his horse, it having been agreed by the seven conspirators who destroyed the usurper Smerdis, that the one of them, whose horse neighed first, should become king.*\n\nIt seems probable that this story points to a Persian custom resembling that which prevailed in India.\n\nIndeed it appears that even in the latter country it was the custom occasionally, to dispense with the elephant, and to rely upon the horse as the sole instrument of selection.\n\nThis is proved by the following passage taken from another story in Dr. Jacobi's collection, the story of the Pratyeka Buddha Karakandu:\n\n\"The three fled and reached K\u0101nchanapura. There the king died without male issue. A horse was let loose, and came near Karakandu,\n\n* Herodotus (Book III, cc. 83\u201487) tells us that the success of Darius was due to an artifice of his groom; but at the same time he asserts that the neighing of the horse was accompanied by thunder and lightning from a clear sky. It is possible that artifice was not always absent in similar cases in India.\nas he was sleeping outside the city. The horse circumambulated him and stood still. The citizens observed with awe that he possessed the auspicious marks of a king. They raised a shout of triumph and beat drums of rejoicing. He rose up yawning.\"\n\nIt is worthy of note that according to Herodotus, the seven conspirators agreed to decide the question of succession, by observing whose horse neighed first in the suburb, (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) at sunrise. This constitutes a further similarity between the Indian custom, and the custom which I suppose to have existed in Persia. It seems natural that both horses and elephants should be employed in India in choosing kings, as Strabo tells us (Book XV, c. 41) that \"no private person is allowed to keep a horse or an elephant. The possession of one or the other is a royal privilege, and persons are appointed to take care of them.\"\n\nThe passages which I have quoted are taken with one exception from Jaina works. But I find a trace of a similar custom in the Darimukhajataka, (Fausb\u00f6ll, Vol. III, p. 238). In this Jataka we read that on the seventh day after the death of the king of Benares without male issue, the purohita sent out the phussaratho. The word phussaratho is explained in Childers's Pali Dictionary as meaning simply \"chariot.\" In Sanskrit the word pushyaratha is said to mean a pleasure-chariot, as opposed to a war-chariot. We are told in the Pali text that the custom of the phussaratho will be explained in the Mahajanajataka, but I have not been able to find this Jataka in the three volumes published by Fausb\u00f6ll. The phussaratho left the city of Benares surrounded by an army of elephants, cavalry, chariots and infantry, and with the beating of many drums, arrived at the gate of the king's garden, in which the two heroes of the tale, the Bodhisattva and his friend Darimukha were sitting. Darimukha knew, as soon as he heard the sound of the drums, that his friend the Bodhisattva would shortly be elevated to the royal dignity, and as he preferred the life of a wandering religious mendicant, he immediately left the garden, for fear that his friend might appoint him commander-in-chief. The purohita entered the garden, and finding the Bodhisattva sitting on the auspicious stone, and seeing that he possessed the auspicious marks which entitled him to govern even the four dvipas, and being satisfied with certain indications of his character, informed him that the crown had fallen to his lot. The Bodhisattva, when he had satisfied himself that the late king had died without male issue, accepted the throne, and his coronation (or rather sprinkling) took place then and there. I own that in this last case the appeal to divination seems to have degenerated into a mere formality.\n\nOf course the collections of Indian tales, from which I have made extracts, contain incidents and plots common to the folk-lore of many\ncountries. But I think that the institution of the five ordeals must have been a custom widely recognised in this country, as otherwise no narrator would have introduced such a minute account of it into tales intended for Indian readers.\n\nNo doubt scholars whose acquaintance with ancient Indian literature is wider than my own, will be able to throw fresh light on the subject.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. *Natural History notes from H. M's. Indian Marine Survey Steamer \"Investigator,\" Commander R. F. Hoskyn, R. N., commanding. No. 25. The Vegetation of the Coco Group.\u2014By D. Prain.*\n\n[Abstract.]\n\nThe Cocos consist of three islands extending over a space of 15 miles, lying 30\u201445 miles north of Landfall, the northmost island of the Andaman main group. These islands were visited by the writer when the \"Investigator\" was surveying there in December 1889 and in November 1890. All three islands were visited and a collection of plants made. This paper describes the collection. It consists of three parts;\n\n1. A sketch of the vegetation of the group with an account of the relationship this bears to the physiographical features of the group.\n2. A list of the species collected; with notes on their habitat, distribution, and, occasionally, their systematic position.\n3. An enquiry into the nature, distribution and probable origin of the Flora.\n\nThe plants collected comprise 358 species distributed among 268 genera and 95 natural orders, 297 species being Phanerogams and 61 Cryptogams\u2014a proportion of 4:85 to 1.\n\nAmong the Phanerogams 238 are Dicots and 59 are Monocots\u2014a proportion of 4 to 1.\n\nAmong the Dicots the Polypetalae equal the rest of the groups in number, a somewhat unusual circumstance. The most extensively represented natural order is Leguminosae (34 sp.); after a long interval come Euphorbiaceae and Gramineae (15 sp. each); Convolvulaceae (14 sp.); Rubiaceae, (13 sp.); Urticaceae, (11 sp.); Cyperaceae, (10 sp.). No other natural order, except Filices, (10 sp.), has more than 8 sp. and 24 of the natural orders have but one species each.\n\nThe non-vascular species (Lower cryptogams\u2014Algae, Fungi, and Lichens) number 46; of the remaining 312 sp., 234 are erect and 78 are climbers\u2014a proportion of 3 to 1.\n\nOf erect species 142 are woody, 92 are herbaceous; among climbers 35 are woody, 43 are herbaceous\u2014a proportion in the first case of 3 to 2 and in the second of 4 to 5. Of the climbing species 20, or 25%, are armed.\nAs regards distribution:\u201470 are cosmopolitan in the tropics, 10 more are present in the tropics of both hemispheres, but are scarcely cosmopolitan; 49 are widely distributed in the eastern hemisphere; 41 are confined to Asia and Australasia; and 188 are confined to South-eastern Asia.\n\nAs regards more local distribution: 252 species extend to India, or Ceylon, or both; 153 species extend to Australia; 140 species to China.\n\nThe islands lie so to speak intermediate between the Indo-Chinese and Malayan phytogeographic districts and the following is the occurrence of species within these:\u2014confined, so far as is yet known, to the Coco Group, 13; occurring in the Andamans, 324 (90%); occurring in Malaya, 275 (76%); in Tenasserim, 259 (72%); in Indo-China, 256 (71%). We conclude therefore that the group forms phytogeographically part of the Andamans and that in its flora a Malayan influence predominates slightly over the Indo-Chinese.\n\nExamined with a view to ascertaining more precisely the probable origin of the flora we find that of species which may possibly have been introduced (not thereby necessarily implying that they are not indigenous but simply pointing out that it is not essential, in order to account for their presence, to postulate a connection of the islands with neighbouring land) the list contains 288, as opposed to 70 that seem to require the conception some former land-connection in order to explain their occurrence. The proportion of Migrant (possibly introduced) species to Remnant (certainly indigenous) species is therefore 4 to 1. The remnant species indicate that the most recent former land-connection may have been with Indo-China.\n\nOf the introduced species 33 are \u201ccivilized\u201d plants, cultivated plants or weeds, introduced voluntarily or involuntarily by man; 94 have been perhaps introduced by birds (assisted perhaps slightly by frugivorous bats); 60 have been introduced by winds; 101 by the sea.\n\nOf the sea-introduced species 21 are marine plants, 80 are littoral species; they appear to have come wholly from Malayan seas. The wind-introduced species indicate that it is the north-east (not the south-west) monsoon which is the more important factor. This might be expected since the latter blows over a wide expanse of ocean to these islands, while the former, though not so strong, blows steadily for some months each year from the direction of the nearest land. The bird-introduced species are of two kinds:\u2014Those attached externally to the bodies of birds and those carried in the crops of birds. Of the first kind there are two sub-groups: a. those attached immediately to their bodies by reason of the fruits being viscous or being provided with barbs or\nhooklets to their seeds or fruits; of this kind there are possibly 9 species:\nb. by means of other substances, e.g., spiders-webs, or mud, as in the case\nof swimming and wading birds; of this kind there are 16.\n\nThose carried in the crops of birds are also of two different kind: a.\nthose introduced by frugivorous birds (perhaps also partly by bats), where\nthe fruits are eaten on account of their pulp and the seeds, though swal-\nlowed, are voided uninjured; of this kind there are 55. This mode of\nintroduction is an every-day result of the mode of life of the creatures\nconcerned: b. those introduced by grain- and seed-eating birds, where\nintroduction can only happen when the bird that brings the seed or\ngrain falls a victim, on arrival, to some bird or beast of prey; this may\nhappen in the case of any migrating bird when it arrives fatigued after\na lengthened flight, and must also happen to a certain proportion of the\nbirds that are driven, numbed or injured, to the land by storms. Of\nthis kind there are perhaps 14 species.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part II.\n\n2. List of Diptera of the Oriental region, Part II,\u2014By Mons. J. M.\nF. Bigot.

The Antiquities of Belwa-Sirsea,\u2014By Gerindranath Dutt, Superintendent of the Hutwa Raj. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\nEver since my lot was cast to serve this R\u00e1j, I have been labouring under the impression that this very ancient R\u00e1j is replete with objects worthy of an antiquarian\u2019s research. The situation of the temple and forest at Thaway and the site of the Hosseypore forts (old capital of the Hutwa Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jas), and the winter tour diary of my predecessor, the former Superintendent of the Hutwa R\u00e1j, who is now the Manager, framed this belief into a conviction which was strengthened by learning of the Lauriya-Araraj and Lauriya-Navandgarh pillars in the neighbouring R\u00e1j of Bettiah from Cunningham\u2019s Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum (Vol. I, p. 4). Only the other day I issued orders to all native Thikad\u00e1rs and Putwaries of the villages to inform me at once if they know or hear of the existence of any relic of antiquity; and the reports received from various quarters of this extensive estate made me sanguine of success. The most interesting of these reports is the one received from the Putwary of Belwa Bhaya, a village in lease to the Moniarah Factory, about 6 miles north-west of the sub-division of Gopalgunge and 18 miles from the Hutwa Palace. I could not make time to see the place through press of work till the 3rd instant, when I set out for the place having previously sent a sowar to catch hold of the Putwary and keep him waiting at the Gopalgunge road to lead me to the place.\n\nAs we neared the place the existence of very old Bar and Pipal trees on the sides of the road led me to conclude that we were entering a place of some antiquity. Our camp was pitched at some distance from the spot, but without halting there for rest, notwithstanding the fatigue of a drive over 18 miles of road only partly metalled, we drove direct to\nthe spot, which is a small jungle of about a bigha, circumscribed by cultivated fields. There under a Pipal tree (which does not appear to be as old as the antiquities themselves) stands a big image of Buddha Gautama, which was formerly buried under a mound of earth and is not yet wholly dug out. Although the Putwary in his report had stated this to be a Bhauroji's Murti, as called by the ignorant villagers, from the description given in it I was at once convinced, even before seeing the spot, that the antiquities must be of a Buddhistic and not Brahmanical period. The length of the whole image, excluding the pedestal and including the arched top which much resembles a chalchitra (\u091a\u093e\u0932\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930), is 6', 5\" and breadth 3', 4\". The figure itself measures 3', 10\" from the feet to the mutilated head. It is in a standing posture, having its head cut off down to the chin and both hands mutilated, showing the vandalism of fanatics on the revival of Brahmanism. On both sides of the figure are carved figures of lions and elephants ridden by male human forms measuring 1', 2\". Below this are figures of two women about 2 feet in length, having their hands and heads mutilated. The arched top is finely ornamented with decorations. In its middle is the half mutilated face of some form much resembling that of a dragon or Nrisimha, having on its both sides the forms of two fairies flying with folded hands but with mutilated faces. The pedestal on which the image stands has got in its cornice finely carved male human figures in kneeling postures with folded hands. The whole image is carved out of a single block of black marble, and stands on a block reported to have taken root deep in the ground.\n\nBesides this image of Buddha we found, lying on the ground, door-frames, said to have been excavated by some Sadhu. The two door jambs measure 5' 2\" x 10' x 7', having eight human figures, all in different postures, and beautifully interlacing cornices. The biggest of these figures is 7 inches and others 5 inches. The two jambs correspond to each other in every particular. The top sill measures 5' 1\" (broken) x 1' 2\" x 8\u00bd\", and shows the figure of Buddha in Padmasan under an arcade. The face and right hand of the figure are mutilated, and the left hand is counting mantras. It has very beautifully carved cornices with mouldings. There are several human figures in the uppermost cornice, which is divided into ten little columns each containing two human figures playing musical instruments. On both the extremities are two large figures with mutilated faces.\n\nThe bottom sill measures 6' 10\" in length of which 5 feet 1 inch is covered with ornaments, and 10 inches on each side appear to bear traces of some inscriptions. This sill measures 10 by 7\u00bd inches. The ornamental part contains beautifully interlacing foliage.\nThe villagers asserted that images, &c., are found wherever the spot is dug, and on digging out a little I found three large stones, two running at right angles and one horizontal, containing mutilated figures, some riding on a bull, a lion and a tiger, and two other hopelessly mutilated animal figures. Another slab was partially dug out, lying just in front of Buddha's image, bearing some marks which may be those of inscriptions. Hard by the image of Buddha, under the P\u00edpal tree, is a choked up well, which is said to contain a good many images and also the severed limbs of these figures.\n\nWe were then led a few yards further out of this jungle to a P\u00edpal tree with shrub-grown pile at its foot, under which the villagers asserted the image of Sivji was buried. I only discovered a slab lying there, but cannot say what could be discovered on removing the mound of earth.\n\nThence we drove to the adjacent village of Sirsea to see the fort of the Cheroos. Who these Cheroos were, the villagers could not tell; but on questioning the Manager of the Hutwa R\u00e1j I learnt that they were the ancient (aboriginal?) inhabitants now extinct, and that relics of their time were also being found in some other parts of the R\u00e1j. We found no sort of fortification at Sirsea but only a high level charida (pastural) ground, of about 25 or 30 bigh\u00e1s, perforated with pits of porcupines. We found there a number of small wells, only 3 feet square, strongly built with small bricks none of which had given way. I saw one of these wells still used by the villagers to water their fields by means of a Dhenk\u00fal, and I was informed of the existence of one more almost choked up, but they asserted there were 52 in former times.\n\nThe villagers then spoke of the existence of some gh\u00e1t where the Cheroo R\u00e1ja used to bathe; but as it was too dark I had to return without seeing it.\n\n2. On the Din\u00e1jpur Copper Plate Inscription of Mah\u00f3p\u00e1la,\u2014By Prof. F. Kielhorn, C. I. E., G\u00f6ttingen. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\n3. First Instalment of the Bower Manuscript, transcript, translation and notes,\u2014By Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\n\nThe papers will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n4. On a Botanical visit to Little Andaman and the Nicobars.\u2014By D. Prain.\n\nWhile awaiting the arrival of the \"Investigator\" at Port Blair in November 1890, the writer was invited by Col. Cadell, v. c., Chief Commissioner of the Andamans, to visit, in connection with the Botanical Survey of India, the islands of Narcondam and Barren Island, two places\nrarely visited and not previously botanically explored. Having obtained\nthe permission of Dr. G. King, F. B. S., the writer was enabled to make\nthis visit in the \"Nancowry\" during March and April 1891. After visit-\ning Narcondam the steamer was required at Port Blair in order to proceed\nto Little Andaman and Car Nicobar, and Col. Cadell not only permitted\nthe writer to accompany the vessel there, but also, at the suggestion of\nMr E. H. Man, kindly directed her to proceed to Batti Malv, a small\nisland without inhabitants and very difficult of access, lying 18 miles\nsouth of Car Nicobar. After returning from Batti Malv the steamer\ntook the writer to Barren Island.\n\nThe botanical results of the visits to Narcondam and Barren Island,\nwhich together formed the central feature of the tour, and the botanical\nexploration of which was the writer's main purpose, will, it is hoped,\nsoon be made public. The results of the visits to the islands of Little Anda-\nman, Car Nicobar and Batti Malv have been dealt with separately and are\nnow laid before the Society. They have been treated in this fashion,\npartly because these visits formed an episode in the tour apart from its\nmain object, but chiefly because the lists are less exhaustive, owing to\nthe short time available for collection in each place, than the correspond-\ning lists for Barren Island and Narcondam will be.\n\nThe details of the visits are as follows:\u2014the \"Nancowry\" left\nPort Blair on the morning of Good-Friday, reaching Bomliya Creek,\nwhere two natives of Little Andaman, who had been visiting Port Blair,\nwere to be landed, about 2 p.m. As the state of the tidal currents made\nit inadmissable to leave again till 5-30, the writer had an opportunity of\nspending three hours in collecting at the mouth of the creek and for a\nmile or two along the north coast of the island to the east of this.\nThe jungle behind the beach forest was too dense and the time avail-\nable too short to admit of his penetrating any distance into the interior.\n\nThe island of Little Andaman, as seen from the sea, presents a\nsomewhat different appearance from Great Andaman. Instead of being\ndiversified by ridges and valleys and isolated hills, it has a long, low\nuniform rounded outline similar to that of Sentinel Island as seen from\nthe top of Mount Harriet near Port Blair, and to that of Car Nicobar.\nIt appears, however, to be uniformly covered with forest and to have\nnone of the bare grass-heaths that characterise Car Nicobar. The\ncreek at which the writer landed is the principal one on the north coast\nof the island. It derives its name from an Andamanese word meaning\n\"flies,\" and certainly these insects abound there in great numbers and\nare very troublesome. There is nothing in the mangrove-swamp vege-\ntation to distinguish this from similar places in the Andamans and very\nlittle in the beach-forest to characterise the island except that Casu-\narina equisetifolia is here very plentiful immediately behind the beach. This species, the writer was informed at Port Blair, is equally plentiful in the whole circuit of the coast, so much so that the Andamanese name for the island is Wirra-Maru, Anglic\u00e9 \"Casuarina-sand.\" In Great Andaman this tree, as an indigenous species, is confined to a single bay on the west side of North Island. As in Great Andaman there are no Coco-nut trees on the coast. On the reefs the chief distinctive features are the presence of beds of Halophila ovalis and considerable quantities of Halimeda discoidea. The visit took place between half-tide and full-tide and no exposed rocks were seen in the vicinity at the time.\n\nLeaving about 6 p.m. the \"Nancowry\" steamed to Car Nicobar to land some men belonging to Kimi\u00f3s village, who had been in prison at Port Blair. Sawi Bay was reached on Saturday morning and two men of Moos village, with their canoe, were taken on board to assist in landing on Batti Malv. Owing to the heavy surf running it was found that landing in Kimi\u00f3s Bay would be very difficult; the vessel therefore, about 2 p.m., anchored off another village 5 miles to the north and the writer was able to land, and walk to Kimi\u00f3s and back, along two jungle paths, collecting by the way and getting on board again at dusk. Owing to the short time available attention could only be directed to the sea-fence, the beach-forest, the under-growth of the Coco-nut zone, and the mere outskirts of the interior jungle. Car Nicobar is so well-known that no particular notice of its appearance is necessary. There is the usual fringing-reef with a sandy beach, behind this the sea-fence, and within that a zone of beach-forest, of which the area under Coco-nut trees forms an integral portion. The indigenous species are very much like those of the Andamans in similar places\u2014the great distinguishing feature being, of course, the wide Coco-nut zone. The Coco-nuts themselves are particularly fine, and though at Port Blair the finest sorts of Nicobarese and Ceylonese Coco-nuts are carefully cultivated they do not equal those of Car Nicobar either in flavour or size. Yet those of Car Nicobar are said to be by no means the best that the Nicobars can produce. The true interior forest and the grass heaths the writer had no opportunity of examining.\n\nIn the night the \"Nancowry\" proceeded to Batti Malv, which was reached at dawn on Easter-day, and the writer, going on shore at once, spent the greater part of the day there, collecting. Landing, even with the assistance of the Nicobarese and their canoe, was effected with considerable difficulty at the north-west corner of the island, where alone it is said to be possible to go on shore. At this point the shore is precipitous, sinking into deep water without any coral fringing-reef and rising into a jagged wall broken somewhat by gullies and small caverns, nearly\neverywhere overhanging, and occasionally with tunnelled projecting points. This wall is here on an average from 10-15 feet above high-water-mark. There was no time to circumnavigate the island, but the coast is said to present similar features in its whole circuit, the cliff being highest at the south-west corner of the island and being there about 50 feet high.\n\nThe difficulty of landing is largely due to this feature of overhanging cliff and is much increased by the strength of the tidal currents which, even in calm weather, cause a heavy swell to surge into the caverns and along the cliff-face. On reaching the edge of the cliff we find, at this part of the coast, a rocky platform over which the waves evidently wash in the monsoon. The rock is a limestone, and is, by weathering and wave-action, worn into the most fantastic spikes and pinnacles and ridges,* the sharp edges of which make walking extremely difficult. This platform slopes backwards rather rapidly to a height of about 10 feet more when the jungle commences with the ordinary sea-fence of Pandanus, etc.; the platform itself is almost destitute of vegetation, the only species present in it being tufts of Oldenlandia corymbosa, Boerhaavia repens and Fimbristylis diphylla. Within the sea-fence the surface of the island is even and almost flat from side to side of the island.\u2020\n\nThe commonest tall tree is Mimusops littoralis, which is not here confined to the coast-zone, but extends from side to side of the island. The jungle is less dense than Andamans and Nicobar forests usually are. There is a wonderful absence of climbing species, especially of the class of armed climbers, and there is a remarkably large number of species with edible fruits, a feature that doubtless owes its existence\n\n* This fantastically-weathered limestone so much resembles the bottom of a coral-pool that the rock has actually been described as a raised coral-reef. (See Hume: The Islands of the Bay of Bengal, in Stray Feathers, vol. ii, p. 95).\n\n\u2020 The Admiralty maps give the island a \"landmark-height\" of 180 feet which is doubtless correct, and in some maps it will be seen that a hill is indicated in the centre of the island; this, however, is quite incorrect. The height at the north-east corner is, as has been said in the text, about 30 feet; at the south-west corner the height is said to be about 60 feet; assuming that the whole island has an even surface the middle of the island cannot exceed 45 feet. Here, as in all other islands exposed to strong monsoons, the trees immediately on the coast are stunted and dwarfed, becoming progressively taller as we pass inland. The principal tree is Mimusops littoralis, and even near the shore this often reaches a height of 60 feet, while trees a few hundred yards inland reach 80 feet; this is the common height of the tree and one which it rarely exceeds. The height obtained by angular measurement from the sea thus not only does not require us to suppose that there is a hill in the middle, but shows that there cannot be anything of the sort and the newer maps correctly indicate that the island has a flat surface.\nto the fact that the island, being so remote and so inaccessible, is largely frequented by fruit-eating pigeons and is one, (it has been even said, is the only), known locality in which the large Nicobars pigeon (*Caloenas nicobarica*) breeds. Fruit-eating bats too are abundant in the island and are perhaps partly responsible for the introduction of some of these species. Among the more interesting species of this kind is the *Datura*, which in most localities is considered, and probably correctly considered, a species introduced by man but which here undoubtedly must be a bird-introduced plant. Not only is it an exceedingly rare thing for the Nicobarese to visit the island, *Datura* is not a plant with which they are acquainted. The writer, who collected all the possibly introduced species to be found in the neighbourhood of the two villages on Car Nicobar visited by him did not find it present. Moreover it was apparently not found either by Mr. Jelinek during the visit of the frigate \"Novara\" or by Mr. Kurz during his visit to the Nicobars, and no Solanaceae are enumerated in Mr. Kurz's list of Nicobars plants in the Society's Journal, vol. xlv, part 2, p. 115 et seq. Though uninhabited and apparently very rarely visited there are some Coco-nut trees; the nuts are, however, small and their flavour is rather poor. The few trees that occur are just within the *Pandanus* fence, and there is nothing like a Coco-nut zone. There is no water on the island; still, besides the bats, there occur, of mammalia, both rats and pigs; the traces of the latter were very common and one pig's skull was found in the jungle. The great feature of the island, however, is the enormous multitude of Nicobar pigeons. These swarm everywhere, in the trees and on the ground, and remind one by their numbers of an English \"rookery.\"* No snakes were seen, but the number and variety of the lizards was very remarkable.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the island was the freshness and greenness of the foliage, even in March; a circumstance that, considering the nature of the soil, must be altogether explained by the remarkably heavy dews that are deposited in these latitudes. Landing as the writer did, at day-break, he found the leaves quite as heavily laden with water as they could possibly have been after a thunder-shower, and on the side of the island away from the sun the dews had not yet become completely dissipated at 10 A.M.\n\nAfter spending eight hours on shore the writer, himself, but not the island, exhausted, had reluctantly to return to the \"Nancowry\" which at once steamed off to Andamans, reaching Port Blair on Monday at noon.\n\n* For an interesting account of the appearance of the island see Mr. Hume's paper already referred to; *Stray Feathers*, vol. ii, pp. 94\u201497.\nIn the two subjoined lists the plants obtained during this short tour are enumerated. The first list gives, for the sake of convenience, those collected in Little Andaman. Species for which their occurrence here is the first indication of their presence in the Andaman group are distinguished by an asterisk.\n\nThe second list gives the plants obtained in Car Nicobar and in Batti Malv. Those for which this is the first record of their occurrence in the Nicobars and which are not given in the Enumeration of the plants of the Nicobar Islands by Mr. Kurz (Journ. As. Soc. Beng., xlv, pt. 2, p. 115\u2014164) are similarly distinguished.\n\nI.

(Sterculia mollis Kurz in Jour. As. Soc. Beng., xlv, pt. 2, 120 not of Wallich.)\n\nMELIACE\u00c6.\n\n5. Carapa obovata Blume.\n\nHaving seen both O. obovata Bl., and O. malaccensis Lamk. in situ and examined them as they grow, it is very difficult for the writer to give his assent to the proposition that treats the two as conspecific. O. moluccensis is common on rocky coasts, while O. obovata is confined to muddy flats, in which it is common, and to mangrove-swamps, of the vegetation of which it forms an integral portion. There is no difficulty with the large suites of specimens that are preserved in the Calcutta Herbarium in distinguishing the one plant from the other, and the residents of Port Blair who know both find it impossible to understand why botanists should wish to believe them to be the same. It may be that their differences, so palpable to the untrained eye, are altogether due to the environment of the two being so different; this, however, if it be a fact, can only be demonstrated by experiment and the onus probandi\nobviously rests with those who would unite, not with those who can distinguish, the trees; till the point is settled the writer feels compelled to follow Blume in treating them as distinct. In the Andamans *Carapa moluccensis* flowers in November and December, *C. obovata* flowers in March and April.\n\n**LEGUMINOS\u00c6.**\n\n*Desmodium umbellatum* DC.\n*Abrus precatorius* Linn.\n*Erythrina indica* Lamk.\n*Canavalia turgida* Grah. in Wall. Cat.\n\nThis is the common sea-shore *Canavalia* of the Andaman, Nicobar and Malayan coasts and is undoubtedly the plant intended by Graham as *C. turgida* Wall. Cat. n. 5534 A, a plant collected by Wallich in Penang. Cat. n. 5534 B, from Siam (*Herb. Finlayson*), is not represented at Calcutta but most probably is, since Graham and Wallich thought so, the same plant. *C. turgida* is certainly not identical with *C. ensiformis*, even if we admit that the *Canavalia gladiata*, cultivated in the Eastern Hemisphere, is conspecific with the American cultivated plant; nor is it the same as *C. virosa* W. & A., with which Mr. Kurz has identified it (*Journ. As. Soc. Beng. xlv*, pt. 2, p. 127) and which the writer agrees with Mr. Baker in considering the wild form of *Canavalia ensiformis* (*C. gladiata*). The interior of the pod, even more than the different shape, makes the proposal to treat *C. turgida* and *C. virosa* as conspecific quite impossible. Perhaps the confusion of *C. turgida* with *C. virosa* may have arisen from the fact that Wall. Cat. 5534 C, from Ava, is true *C. virosa*. A reference, however, to the Lithographed Catalogue itself shews that Dr. Wallich only doubtfully refers the Ava plant to Graham's species. Mr. Baker doubtfully refers *C. Stocksi* Dalz. & Gibs., Bomb. Fl. 69, to *C. turgida*; this is, in the writer's opinion, highly improbable because 1., *C. turgida* seems always strictly confined to sea-shores and to the banks of muddy estuaries and never has been collected inland; and 2, though it extends from the Salt-lakes near Calcutta and from the Sunderbuns at the top of the Bay of Bengal to the Indo-Chinese and Malayan Coasts generally, it has not yet been found anywhere on the coasts of India proper, of Ceylon, or of the Laccadives.\n\nThough a characteristic sea-shore species, *C. turgida* is not conspecific with the *C. obtusifolia* of the coasts of India proper, which apparently does not occur in the Andamans, the Nicobars, or the Malay Peninsula\u2014on the shores of the Andaman sea, though it does occur in Java (as pointed out by Prof. Miquel) to which island *C. turgida* also extends.\nThe writer has not seen fruiting specimens of a Japanese sea-coast species identified by Mr. Maximowicz and others with *C. obtusifolia* DC. (*O. lineata* DC.; *Dolichos lineatus* Thunbg.) but from a flowering specimen in Herb. Calcutta, it is apparently not specifically identical with the Indian *C. obtusifolia* figured by Dr. Cleghorn (*Madr. Lit. Soc. Journ.*, n. s., i, t. 4). On the other hand there is no apparent difference in flowers, leaves or habit, between the Japanese *Dolichos lineatus* and the Indo-Chinese and Malayan *Canavalia turgida*. If the fruits are also found to agree, and if *Dolichos lineatus* is the true *Canavalia obtusifolia*, *C. turgida* will have to be reduced to *C. obtusifolia*. If the fruits differ *C. turgida* undoubtedly deserves the specific rank assigned to it by Graham, Wallich and Miquel. The name \"C. obtusifolia,\" it may be remarked, is as appropriate to the Indian seashore plant, as it is unsuitable to the Japanese littoral *C. lineata* and to the Indo-Chinese and Malayan littoral *C. turgida*.\n\n10. **Vigna lutea** A.

(*Cupania jackiana* Hiern.)\n   Car Nicobar, flowering specimens; Batti Malv; fruiting specimens.\n   There is now no doubt that this species is correctly referred to *Lepidopetalum* by Prof. Radlikofer. The flower-buds are oval, pointed; the 4 green, lanceolate calyx-segments alternate with 4 extremely small, white cordate-acute petals attached to the face of each of which is a single large scale, connate by its margins with the edges of the corresponding petal and forming along with it a small, peltate-infundibuliform pouch; the stamens are 8 in number with glabrous, slender, short filaments and oblong, pilose anthers; the ovary is 2-celled; the fruit, reddish-brown externally, is bright scarlet within, usually the seed of one of the two cells is abortive; the ripe seeds are black, covered with a mucilaginous substance and embraced, as to their lower third, in a pink, cup-shaped, thick, fleshy arillus. It is one of the favourite fruits with *Caloenas nicobarica* and the other frugivorous pigeons. Even if, with Bentham and Hooker, (*Gen. Plantar.* i, 399), generic rank is not accorded to *Lepidopetalum*, Hiern's location of the species in *Cupania* (*Flor. Brit. Ind.* i, 678) is not valid, since, as these authors show, *Lepidopetalum* is more nearly related to *Eatonia*, as understood by them, than to *Cupania*.\nALLOPHYLUS COBBE Blume.\nBatti Malv; the specimens agree exactly with authentic specimens of *A. littoralis* Blume.\n\nERIOGLOSSUM EDULE Blume.\nBatti Malv.\n\nANACARDIACE\u00c6.\n\n20.

In Kamorta, Katschall and Nancowry, where Hindu convicts have been stationed, it is the true or sacred Tulsi (O. sanctum) that has become naturalised. Here, where no Hindus have lived, it is O. Basilicum that is grown by the natives, to whom one Tulsi is as good as another. In the Laccadives, where the people are Mussalmans, and to whom the sacred Tulsi does not specially appeal, it is the Ram Tulsi (O. gratissimum) that occurs.\n\nNYCTAGINE\u00c6.\n\nBoerhaavia repens Linn.\nBatti Malv, on the rocks outside the Pandanus sea-fence.\n\n* Pisonia aculeata Linn.\nBatti Malv.\n\n75. * Pisonia alba Spanoghe.\nBatti Malv.\n\n* Pisonia excelsa Blume.\nBatti Malv.\n\nAMARANTACE\u00c6.\n\n* Amaranthus spinosus Linn.\nCar Nicobar, near Kimi\u00f3s village.\n\n* Achyranthes aspera Linn.\nCar Nicobar, a weed near Kimi\u00f3s village.
