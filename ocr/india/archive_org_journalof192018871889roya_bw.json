M. Skinner, A. Currie, Esq., C. Stringer, Esq., C. B. Buckley, Esq., W. Davison, Esq., S. L. Thornton, Esq., E. Koek, Esq., A. Knight, Esq., H. L. Noronha, Esq., and H. T. Haughton, Esq.\n\nThe Annual Report for the year 1887 was then read by the Honorary Secretary (H. T. Haughton, Esq.) and adopted by the meeting.\n\nA ballot was then taken for the officers for the present year, with the following result:\n\nCOUNCIL FOR 1888.\n\nPresident,\u2014The Hon'ble A. M. Skinner.\nVice-Presidents,\u2014Singapore: W. A. Pickering, Esq., C.M.G.; Penang: D. Logan, Esq.\nHonorary Secretary,\u2014H. T. Haughton, Esq.\nHonorary Treasurer,\u2014E. Koek, Esq.\nCouncillors,\u2014W. Davison, Esq., A. Knight, Esq., S. L. Thornton, Esq., C. Stringer, Esq., H. L. Noronha, Esq.\n\nSome conversation then ensued on the large amount of subscriptions in arrear. The Honorary Treasurer, E. Koek, Esq., explained the difficulty he experienced in collecting subscriptions from members who are not resident in the Colony. The following resolution was finally moved by Mr. Buckley and adopted unanimously:\n\n\"The meeting regrets that the Society is hampered by so large an amount of arrears of subscription, and hopes that the Council will use its best efforts to collect them before the close of the year.\"\n\nThe Honorary Secretary mentioned to the meeting that some valuable papers relating to the life of Sir Stamford Raffles were being compiled by Dr. Rost, of the India Office, and that the Revd. R. B. Raffles was engaged on a Sketch of the Life of Sir Stamford Raffles. It was proposed to publish these papers in a popular form, and he had been for some time in correspondence with Dr. Rost and Mr. Gulland on the subject, but the scheme had hardly yet assumed a definite shape. The meeting declared itself generally in favour of the scheme, but it was resolved to await a further communication from Dr. Rost before pledging the Society to any particular form of support.\n\nThe meeting then closed.\nANNUAL REPORT\nOF THE\nCOUNCIL\nOF THE\nSTRAITS BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nFOR THE YEAR 1887.\n\nThe Council for the year 1887 on retiring have, they believe, a fairly satisfactory Report to lay before the Society.\n\nSince the last General Meeting, the following new members have been elected by the Council, subject to confirmation, under Rule XI, by a General Meeting:\u2014S. Leslie Thornton, Esq., Singapore; Charles Hose, Esq., Sarawak; Henry Walker, Esq., Sandakan; E. M. Merewether, Esq., The Dindings; Lieut. P. Ashworth, R.E., Singapore; R. M. Little, Esq., British North Borneo; the Rev. Bryan Wonnacot, Hongkong; Captain M. A. Cameron, R.E., Singapore; A. T. Bryant, Esq., Penang; the Hon'ble Seah Liang Seah, Singapore; W. Nanson, Esq., Singapore; Dr. W. C. Brown, Penang; F. Thorold Thorold, Esq., Perak; Dr. R. van Beuningen van Helsdingen, Deli, Sumatra; and Wm. Davison, Esq., Singapore.\n\nThe Council announce with regret the deaths of the following members:\u2014the Abb\u00e9 Favre (Honorary Member), G. P. Tolson, Esq., H. Brooke Low, Esq., C. Baumgarten, Esq., N. Cantley, Esq., and Ho Ah Yip Whamboa, Esq.\nThe following members withdrew their subscriptions at the end of the year:\u2014Dr. Bieber, the Rev. L. C. Biggs, G. R. Lambert, Esq., and Peter Nuy, Esq.\n\nThe Abb\u00e9 Favre died in France on the 17th March last year, in his 76th year, and the following minute was entered in the proceedings of a meeting of the Council of the Society held on the 3rd June, 1887:\n\n\"The Council desire to record their sense of the great loss sustained by the Society and all interested in Malayan literature, in the death of one who was so distinguished a Malay scholar and lexicographer.\"\n\nThe new edition of the Map of the Peninsula was completed and sent to Mr. E. Stanford for publication in June last, with the further geographical information referred to in the Annual Report for 1886. At the suggestion of Mr. Stanford, the names in Malay character, which appeared in the Map of 1879, were omitted, as being likely to interfere with the clearness of the map.\n\nNo estimate has yet been received of the probable cost of publication by the Society, but it has been found possible to make use of some of the stones used in printing the old map, and thus a saving will be effected.\n\nTwo hundred copies of the Second Series of \"Essays relating to Indo-China,\" published for the Society by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner & Co., were received in December. The Council, with a view to speedily recovering a part of the cost of publication, resolved to sell the work to Members at half the cost price\u2014i.e., $3\u2014and it is to be hoped that Members will avail themselves of the opportunity thus offered.\n\nThe Library of the Society was moved into the new Raffles Museum at the end of the year, and, through the kindness of Government, room has been found both to accommodate its book-shelves and to serve Members for a reading-room.\nThe Council would take this opportunity of recording their sense of the valuable services rendered by Mr. Copley to the Society in arranging the Library previous to his departure for Malacca.\n\nAn \"Eastern Geography\" by Professor A. H. Keane, in pursuance of the recommendations of the Society in former Reports, was published in London during the year. The first part, which treats of the Malay Peninsula, is based on the elementary work of the Hon'ble A. M. Skinner, published under the auspices of the Society in 1884, and the author acknowledges the assistance he has received from the materials collected on the spot for the other sections also. The work is intended primarily for educational purposes in the Straits Settlements, but the feature of the book is that it embodies the information collected by the most recent explorers in these regions, such as Forbes and Chalmers.\n\nThe Council have again to acknowledge the liberality of the Straits Government in continuing the grant to the Society of $500, without which assistance it would hardly have been possible to publish the new edition of the map of the Peninsula this year.\n\nNo. 18 of the Journal was published since the last General Meeting. It contains the following papers:\n\nEssay towards a Bibliography of Siam\u2014Part II, by E. M. Satow, C.M.G.\n\nEnglish, Sulu and Malay Vocabulary.\u2014by T. H. Haynes (Malay portion by W. E. Maxwell, C.M.G.).\n\nRaja Donan, A Fairy Tale, told by a Malay Rhapso-\ndist\u2014Contributed by W. E. Maxwell, C.M.G.\n\nThe Survey Question in Cochin-China, translated from the \"Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Etudes Indo-Chinoises de Saigon\" with an introduction\u2014by W. E. Maxwell, C.M.G.\nNotes on Economic Plants, Straits Settlements\u2014by N. Cantley.\n\nIndex of Articles in the Journal of Indian Archipelago\u2014by N. B. Dennys, Ph.D.\n\nOccasional Notes.\n\nThe Council announce with regret that the Hon'ble W. E. Maxwell, C.M.G., owing to his absence from Singapore, will be no longer able to lend his valuable services as Honorary Secretary to the Society.\n\nThe Honorary Treasurer's statement of the financial position of the Society is appended, by which it will be seen that the accounts show a debit balance for the first time since the Society was started.\n\nH.

As I had heard from Mr. Whitehead that his researches on North Bornean Ornithology would bring him to the vicinity of Kinabalu, I determined to start with him to the interior, but circumstances prevented him keeping his appointment with me at Gaya Island, and later on when he did arrive, I was away in Putatan, so we did not go together. I left for Tuaran on the 16th of February, arriving at the Government Station the next day.\n\n3. Mr. Resident Davies had arranged for one of his local Chiefs to meet me at Tampasuk; but although I waited two weeks for him, the expected Chief did not turn up. We were to have prospected together for an edible bird's-nest cave, reported to be near Kinabalu.\n\n4. In the meantime, I took a walk to Madang village on the Sungei Damit, a tributary of the Tuaran River. Here is the site of a fair, which was revived by the Government in\n1885, and has ever since been well attended by Hill Dusuns in the vicinity of the Tampasuk River, and Bajaus from Tuaran, Sulaman and Mengkabong.\n\n5. Enroute I noticed quantities of the wild pine-apple growing on old cleared hills. On Bukit Tegas there are several specimens of the kapas (cotton plant). The plant here appears as a low straggling tree having pointed berries three inches long. One bush averages a yield of $2\\frac{3}{4}$ lb of cotton.\n\n6. Madang village is composed of two houses; one, the \"Government Hotel,\" intended for the accommodation of the hill natives; and the other AHMAT'S house. This AHMAT is a Bisaya from Padas, whose acquaintance I made some four years ago in Papar. He followed the late Hdji JAMALUDIN to Tuaran, and on the latter's death, bought his house and took a Dusun wife. Being slightly useful, he is now recognised as the local headman in the district; which is thinly populated and in consequence easily governed. The temperature at Madang at 6 a.m. was 65\u00b0, height above sea level 143 feet.\n\n7. On my return to the Station, I found a flat-bottomed gobong or dug-out awaiting me, which I had previously ordered. Length 28 feet, breadth $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. This is intended to be used when the river is in flood or for shooting rapids.\n\n8. I started for the interior on the 28th February, bringing up my baggage in the dug-out, and stopped at Telibong, sleeping in IBU'S house. IBU is a Bajau, married to a Dusun woman, and has settled down in her village. This village is situated on the left bank of the River Tuaran, just above the junction of the Telibong branch.\n\n9. Next morning found me at Buntai Fair, on the right bank of the Tuaran River and forty minutes' walk from Telibong village. In ordinary weather, the ford across the river is only thigh deep. The fair is always well attended, and in spite of the recent floods, over five hundred natives had assembled who politely awaited my arrival to commence bartering their jungle produce, tobacco and cereals, for fish and dry goods, brought by the Coast tribes. LAMPAYAN, headman of Kabong village near Kinabalu, delivered a message of greeting from Datoh KABONG of Kiau and was glad to hear\nI was starting at last. We slept that night at DUMANKER'S house near the fair. Our host, although a Dusun, has four wives and seven children, each wife contributing her quota of the latter. Buntai Village at 6 a.m. thermometer 72\u00b0.\n\n11. On the 2nd March at 10.55 a.m. left Buntai Village and followed up the Tuaran River to its junction with the Bawang stream; we then travelled along the ridges which form the watershed on the true left side of this stream. This was the route taken by Mr. ST. JOHN in 1858 on his way to Kinabalu, and he has ably described the track to Sinilau village, as being steep, slippery and the climbing exceedingly warm work. We passed over Kamis and Tiwong Hills. On the latter, the stock of water brought up in bamboo joints was finished, but I was agreeably surprised to find out that bamboos, even when growing on hills devoid of springs, secrete in their second or third joints from the ground, a quantity of pure cool water, a great boon to the thirsty traveller. We arrived at Sinilau village at 2 p.m.\n\n12. This village possesses six very scattered houses and two joint Chiefs\u2014MAH TANGARIS and MAH SOULONGKOD\u2014who have paid poll-tax to the Government. They were absent until night in their padi fields.\n\n13. The houses here show me that I am at last in the interior and beyond coast civilization, for they are dirty, infested with bugs, and every moment the howl of a dog indicates a too close proximity with the owner of a cooking pot, and pigs grunt harmoniously under the houses. Sinilau village at 4.45 a.m. thermometer 71\u00b0, height 1,248 feet above sea level.\n\n14. I numbered my coolies next morning, and found I had sixteen Dusuns, one Brunei Malay, and two Dyaks. The Government party consisted of myself, Pangeran SAHBUDIN, Clerk USMAN, GAWANG, the Dusun Sub-Chief, and two privates of the British North Borneo Armed Constabulary. Each coolie had his sword or kris and we had besides six Snider carbines, one smooth bore No. 12 calibre, and one Spencer seven shot repeater. GAWANG carried the flag on a long spear, and an empty cartridge belt as a mark of distinction. I had engaged these coolies at nominal wages, 15 cents per\ndiem and rations while marching, and 10 cents per diem when resting, the Dyaks getting 25 cents and 10 cents, with rations as they represented the gun-bearers.\n\n15. Our start was delayed by some bed-loving coolies who were punished by getting the heaviest loads to carry. We had to walk up a steep incline before arriving at the flat ridge representing the top of Nilau hill, 2,226 feet above sea level. Below, on the left of the path, the hills rising out of the mist resembled islands in a vast sea. Further on, we passed a large pond, at the foot of Tingkahang hill, forty yards in diameter and from three to four feet deep. This, the natives say, is never dry in the longest droughts, owing to numerous springs. The pond resembles an old Roman camp, filled up with water. Ingkahang hill is 1,929 feet high. Passed the junction of an old path used by head-hunters before the cession. Manjok Sironghill, 2,411 feet.\n\n16. The hill leading up to Kalawat village is not so steep as its predecessors, and we arrived at 9.30 a.m. finding most of the men absent. The son of the Bajau headman, however, was there to welcome us, and presented me with the usual stirrup-cup before leaving\u2014a small bamboo of cocoa-nut toddy mixed with the bitter and intoxicating bark of the *rasak* tree. To procure this bark, these natives have to buy it at Buntai Fair, from traders who obtain it at Papar.\n\n17. We toiled up Kalawat hill, at the back of the village, and found it a toilsome task. Were it not for the holes made in the paths by buffaloes' feet on some of these hills, the coolies would be overbalanced by their loads and to add to the task, the jungle has been cleared off, leaving ferns or grass only two or three feet high and no protection against the sun. I was told Kalawat hill was the large hill between this and Kiau. I found this correct. Passed a *tuba* garden. This is an intoxicating weed which is mashed up in water, changing the latter to a milky coloured fluid, and then poured into a stream. All the fish within a half mile are quickly stupefied and easily caught. Despairing lovers sometimes use this weed to end their sorrows.\n\n18. From Kalawat hill we descended at a rattling pace to Tinuman stream, a tributary of the Mantaranau river at\nBungol. Here we had a bath, and cooked our rice. I had seen the men eating a semi-transparent fruit called *kandis*, and followed suit. It had a pleasant acid taste at first, but afterwards my tongue and palate felt as if affected by a strong astringent. This unpleasant sensation lasted until night.\n\n19. After finishing the inevitable rice and tinned mutton, I went specimen hunting and succeeded in picking up conglomerate mixed with crystals, hornblende and quartz. Amongst the rapids, some Dusun had placed a fish trap made of bamboo, but it was empty.\n\n20. One steep but small hill brought us to the banks of the Mantaranau river, we had to cross it and its tributaries several times. At 2.30 we arrived at Bungol. This village is built on the sides of a hollow which looks pretty, the grass having been grazed short. We took up our quarters in Bansayan\u2019s house, it being large and the headman\u2014Datoh Benawa\u2014being absent. But Bansayan said \u201cyou cannot enter here,\u201d of which we took no notice until Gawang had arranged matters at Datoh Benawa\u2019s house where we shifted, the culprit following and asking for pardon. At the Datoh\u2019s I met two women Si Dain and Si Giban and two women Kambing and Kaudeh who had just arrived from the Sindatun district bringing tobacco for barter. Their village is one day\u2019s journey from Bungol and the headman pays one buffalo as poll-tax this year.\n\n21. I append a sketch of the whereabouts of Sindatun as described by Si Dain. The women wore stained rattan and brass chainwork, a foot broad around their substantial waists and brasswire on their lower arm which they only take off on becoming matrons. Their dress was a short indigo dyed petticoat reaching to the knee and a similar cloth 14\u201d by 4\u201d across to the bosom sustained by a few coils of stained rattan. The men, as everywhere in the interior, wore only a dirty loin cloth. Dain stated that all the villages on both sides of the Sinalang river are disposed to join with Sindatun in tendering submission to Government, and I intended to have visited this district, but was unable to carry out the whole of my programme.\n22. As we had several cases to settle, next day became Sunday. Dyak Jemain borrowed my casting-net and caught a lot of fine fish, but Pangeran Sahbudin informed me that the large ones were garbage fish; in spite of this the men seemed to appreciate the rare treat of fresh fish. I walked up the Mantaranau, which passes through lawn like valleys, bordered by low hills, and I certainly thought I should like to spend a week here and amuse myself fishing, for the pools are full of the finny tribe who were jumping at the flies in a systematic manner. This river joins the Kamulau, at whose source is Kalansatan, the village of Gantok, the Teg\u00e2s Chief. Kamulau River is a tributary of the Tuaran River, flowing in on its right bank between Linggah and Bayag villages.\n\n23. In the evening, I met the Rungus Maragang Chiefs and settled a blood feud. It appears that Kubud of Rambatuan informed these Chiefs that Tapakawn village near Madang had not come under the Government (a falsehood), so they killed a certain man, Simpagawn, in retaliation for the brutal murder of 18 women and children in 1884 by Nakoda Radin, acting under Pangeran Kamandra's orders, who was then Brunei agent in Tuaran. In consequence of the Rambatuan massacre, when we got the cession of Tuaran, Nakoda Radin (a Sarawak Dyak who had left his country years ago) was wanted, but he fled to Mengkabong, and died there in 1885. Before the Rambatuan feud could be settled by us, these Rungus Maragang Dusuns retaliated, almost causing a fresh outburst of the feud.\n\n24. Left Bungol on the 5th March in company with Datoh Benawa. Kampin hill, beyond the second crossing of the Mantaranau, was terribly steep, but the Dusuns had thoughtfully cleared a path through the lalang grass, a fathom wide. The height of the hill is 2,363 feet, from the top of Kampin hill, Kinabalu bore E. by S., Kiau S.E. by E., and Pinokok E. by N. \u00bd E. Descending its eastern slope was no easy matter owing to the steepness of the path, the soil being clay, covered with loose bits of sandstone, even on the steepest places, padi had been grown and I cannot but admire the indifference to fatigue which would enable the local females to endure the consequent toil.\n25. At the foot of the hill, flows the upper water of the Tampasuk river locally called Sungei Kadamayan. Our path brought us to the side of a pool with a gravel bed, and here we halted to cook and bathe and collect specimens. From Bungol village to this ford we took $3\\frac{1}{4}$ hours to accomplish the distance, the pace being slow. St. John mentions his guide took him by a longer route occupying 8 hours.\n\n26. Amongst the specimens we found, were serpentine, granite, quartz and hornblende, and in the sand, bordering the stream, I washed out a large quantity of mica which at first greatly excited the natives.\n\n27. The land on the right bank of the Tampasuk is flat and planted with padi and kaladi. We met Lampayan, the headman of Kadong (spelt Koung by St. John), who led us to his village by a path which followed the river. A few minutes' walk brought us to Kahong, but Labong Labong village being only a little further on, we declined his hospitality.\n\n28. Kahong is built on a grassy sward close to the river on its right bank. To get to Labong Labong, we had to cross the Kadamayan twice and climb up a steep and slippery hill before arriving at the village. About 200 yards distant from the houses we had to climb over a stout bamboo fence which I am told is intended to prevent the cattle straying of which the people here have a goodly stock. At 12 noon we were installed in Mah Tampulan's house, enjoying unlimited quantities of toddy and cocoa-nut water. Tampulau, the practical headman, for Mah Tampulan is getting old, arranged that each house in the village, should provide food for two coolies; he himself attending to the leaders.\n\n29. The name \"Mah Tampulan\" means \"the father of Tampulan,\" from a custom common amongst the Hill Dusuns, Illanuns and Sarawak Dyaks, who, when their sons are married, assume their name adding the prefix. Mah is a contraction for Tamah, father\u2014Tidih meaning mother. Mah Tampulan informed me that Mr. Whitehead was staying at Melangkap, lower down the river; and was obtaining quantities of birds. We devoted the evening to hearing cases and examining into various reports of birds' nest caves. Three\nyoung women entertained us to some sweet singing called *Inggano*. The songs treated of love and courtship, and the allusions must have been amusing, for the men were constantly laughing, but I am told nothing improper was mentioned.\n\n30. I wanted to purchase a tiger-cat's skin, but the owner would not part with it for two fathoms of black cloth and, for the benefit of future traders and travellers, I declined to give more. The Hill Dusuns are keen traders and should one man give a high price for anything, the next man has probably to give still higher or do without it.\n\n31. It was arranged that Labong Labong village should give two buffaloes this year as poll-tax, and pay the regular amount next year. Birds'-nest caves are reported to have been found in Kinabalau facing Kiau, at Kaporingan, and in the Labuk district at Kandasang village. It was arranged between Lampayan and Tampulan that a buffalo should be sacrificed to-morrow in honour of the treaty of friendship.\n\n32. Next morning at 5.45 a.m. the thermometer registered $71^\\circ$, aneroid 1,659 feet above sea level. When Bunahow and Datoh Kabong, Chiefs of Kiau, arrived, we all adjourned to the village green, and found a young buffalo had been tied to a tree at the foot of a large boulder. The police and gun-bearers fell into position and a volley was fired, the British North Borneo flag hoisted, and the local Tuaran flag (white ground, a red triangle with \"Tuaran\" in red below) presented to Tampulan. While Clerk Usman was cutting the buffalo's throat, a rectangular stone was planted upright in the turf and Coast and Hill Dusuns laid their hands on the stone, swearing eternal friendship. Gawang states he has visited sixty-four villages, and they all request a similar ceremony.\n\n33. In the evening, we had some further talk about birds' nests. Datoh Kabong reports caves at Mumus hill, but the natives of Bilawng stupidly eat the nests and do not allow outsiders to interfere.\n\n34. Descended Labong Labong hill to the junction of two streams, S. Kimitakeh and Tahobang. Here we debated which way we should go, either by the Kadamayan river or over the hills to Kiau. Finally the hill route was chosen. Datoh\nKABONG begged us not to drink of the Tahobang water, for this stream supplies water to Kiau Nuloh, a section of Kiau, with whom he has a social quarrel: should we persist in drinking, we certainly would suffer terribly, for on taking refreshments in his house, the unfriendly waters would create discord inside us. The hill climbing was not severe and enroute we had a splendid view of Kinabalu.\n\n35. Kiau village is situated on Hangkong hill and divided into three sections\u2014upper, middle and lower. The slopes around the houses are grazed by cattle and buffaloes, water is brought down by means of bamboo piping. At 6 a.m. the thermometer registered $70^\\circ$; aneroid giving $27^\\circ 13''$ or 2,635 feet above sea level as equivalent to the height of middle Kiau. Datoh KABONG is the headman of the middle village together with BAGING, BUNAHOW owns the lower village. The upper village, Nuloh, I did not visit. Even Lower Kiau is a long away above the Kadamayan, for the ground adjoining the river is only used for planting padi, vegetables and tobacco.\n\n36. I had brought \"Life in the Forests of the Far East\" with me, and occupied myself in translating part of it to the Kiau natives. My host was Datoh KABONG's relation and was called KULABID. Our quarters were in a long house containing 4 doors which equals 4 families. My mattress as usual was laid on the sleeping dais, outside in the passage, and this, having always windows closed, was cool and airy. Round the foot of my bed, sat the young women and Chiefs who eagerly examined my field glass, illustrated books, and a few drawings I had made. H.S. KING & Co.'s illustrated catalogue was in special demand, they even got leave to take it away to other houses to show their friends the jewelry section. I bought a gourd pan-pipe, similar to that used in Sarawak, for one fathom black cloth and found the notes to be very sweet, and a great contrast to a concert performed by a litter of pups in an adjoining bed-room.\n\n37. The married women who have children to look after are marvellously dirty. As they do not wear the breast cloth, one is convinced that the curious custom of eating earth is not alone confined to Bajau women in a certain stage of\ntheir life, but applies equally to the Hill Dusun baby who, unlike Lord Chesterfield, seems to prefer to swallow his peck of dirt at one meal. The girls and childless wives wear the short petticoat and breast cloth, but do not load their ankles with tinkling brass fetters like some of their coast sisters, but the brass chain work and rattan is worn round the waist. The men are comparatively clean and shave their heads like the Islam native, which is greatly to be commended.\n\n38. Took a stroll up the hill side as far as Baging's house. He reports Mr. Whitehead to be leaving for Gaya in 5 days' time. I met Si Kamoh, one of the men who followed Mr. Low up Kinabalu. We had a trifling disagreement in the afternoon, as Baying asked for chukei jalan, or road-tax, but the enormity of his conduct was explained to him and he desisted.\n\n39. We arranged to start to-morrow for the birds' nest caves at the Kadamayan river. The meeting ended by the Hill Dusuns going out to look for a suitable cow or buffalo to be sacrificed during the friendship ceremony. After numberless delays, the Kiau Chiefs succeeded in obtaining a goat, and at 5 p.m. the ceremony commenced.\n\n40. Before the treaty stone was planted, I laid a cent in the hole, intended for the stone. My servant handed me a Straits Settlements coin in place of a British North Borneo cent, but the mistake was not detected. Kinabalu was called upon to bear witness to the treaty, and the sun, which had hitherto been hiding behind a bank of clouds, broke out and all exclaimed \"A happy omen!\"\n\n41. The sunset that evening was lovely, showing all shades of gold and silver and lighting up the purple mass of Kinabalu, towering overhead, which reflected back the sinking sun from its crystal rocks.\n\n42. To-day, the 9th of March, saw us getting ready for a start. Datoh Kabong and Bunahow promised to come down to Tuaran, but the former said he was afraid of Orang Kaya Bladau, one of the coast Dusuns, who is a well-known swindler and who has since met his deserts. At 10 a.m. we set off, leaving 13 coolies behind, and descended to Bun-\nAHOW'S village where we picked up that Chief, who, however, was unacquainted with the position of the caves, but LUMBAG, his aged follower, agreed to come after us on the next day and point them out. Descended again to the Kadamayan stream and followed up its bed, till we halted at a cave at the side of the river and had tiffin.\n\n43. The bed of the stream is full of hornblende, granite, quartz and limestone boulders, and we picked up numerous specimens containing copper or copper pyrites, or perhaps only iron pyrites. Only a little further on, we came to Mitunbok gorge, with an overhanging cliff on the left bank, which we made our halting place for the night, greatly to my disgust, for we were only a few miles distant from Kiau, but BUNAHOW said he had agreed to wait here for LUMBAG, the guide, and as there were two roads to the caves he might miss him were we to go on. At 4 p.m. the thermometer registered $72^\\circ$, and at 6 a.m. I ascertained the height to be 2,651 feet, or only 16 feet above the village of middle Kiau.\n\n44. Our beds were certainly not the most comfortable, as we had to lay the mats on gravel after removing the boulders, but a few wild plaintain leaves helped to alleviate the hardness. Our conversation was limited owing to the noise of the rapids only a few feet distant. The river rose slightly the next day and I noticed that the flood mark was long away above our heads, but a hill with a tolerable slope a hundred yards distant would have afforded us a shelter against freshets. Although LUMBAG promised to meet us in the morning, he did not arrive until 1 p.m. excusing his lateness by saying he was drunk. When at Kiau, the headman Datoh KABONG had promised to forward rice which the carriers were to bring us next day, but mistrusting his promises I sent two parties back to hurry him up.\n\n45. The Dyaks amused themselves next morning cutting through bagong stems, a soft wood, and we all went in for cockshies at a stone attached to an overhanging creeper and swung back and forward. At 8.15 a.m. we started for the caves. Just before we left, LUMBAG informed us that the road to the caves led to Kinabalu. I had previously been told at Kiau that to ascend Kinabalu necessitated re-\nturning to the village and in consequence had only provided for a two days' tramp, as also had the men, but we determined to push on and lose no more time. We followed the river up for half a mile and turned up the right bank. The almost obliterated path led us up a hill side, very steep and so slippery that had it not been for the numerous roots, which we were able to haul on in getting up, I think we should have been obliged to look for another path.\n\n46. On reaching the hill top, we followed the track along the ridges in an E. N. E. direction. At 9.20 a. m. the aneroid registered 3,482 feet. Thermometer 74\u00b0. At 10.45 a. m. thermometer 70\u00b0, aneroid 4,806 feet. At 11.26 a. m. 72\u00b0 and 5,228 feet. Looking at the Kadamayan, we saw a waterfall, St. John describes it as follows:\u2014\"At one place \"we had a view of a magnificent cascade* * * * the \"stream coming to the edge of the precipice throws itself \"over and in its descent of above 1,500 feet appears to \"diffuse itself in foam ere it is lost in the depths of the dark \"wooded ravines below.\" I stood on a projecting root and examined this noble fall through my field-glass, but could only see a portion of the descending water and cannot therefore say what the height may be owing to the spray and mist, but I think it worthy to be called Regina Falls in honour of Her well beloved Majesty. The path at this point was only a foot broad, on either side were sheer precipices.\n\n47. At 12.5 p. m. the rain fell heavily but after each man had eaten a biscuit we plodded on. From here the path began to descend, direction E. S. E.; we had to pass along the face of a sloping rock down which the rain water was running. Some moss growing on the rock afforded a precarious foothold but so fragile that on hearing some one behind slip, I could not turn round to see who it was. It turned out to be the Brunei Malay Pangeran Bakar and without doubt he had cause to congratulate himself on a narrow escape.\n\n48. At 2 p. m. the men begged me to halt as they could not stand the cold any longer so, choosing a flat spot, my tent was unpacked and erected horizontally. It accommodated the whole of our party, 26 in all. Our first attempts to obtain fire were unsuccessful, owing to the wood being wet, but with\nthe help of Kerosine oil, we soon had half a dozen fires going.\n\n49. The Dyaks reported having seen Tiong Tuan village from the \"slippery rock.\" I find that we have arrived at the caves at last, as the river Kadamayan is only 100 yards distant.\n\n50. I awoke at 2.45 a.m. and found the thermometer registered $59^\\circ$. At half past five I walked to the river and saw above me a small cascade 70 feet high and to its left the entrance to two caves. A few swallows were flying out, but these Pangeran Sahbudin said were not the \"cave swallow.\" Nanggai and Rajib tried to climb up, but a log, which they would have had to cross was too fragile and we deferred the search until ropes of rattan could be made.\n\n51. I sent back Gawang, Bunahow, Datoh Benawa and two coolies to hurry up Mapadri who is to bring the rice and we are to meet at Tamborongah, the next stage.\n\n52. We then commenced making ropes with the janggut rattan, a pretty species about the thickness of a drawing pencil. When the rope was finished, we found that, owing to a small precipice above the bank of the river, another rope five fathom long was necessary. Some of the men cut sticks and laid them on a frame, so as to form bed places for us all. As usual rain fell in the afternoon, but this time we were under cover.\n\n53. The caves were examined next morning by Rajib, and proved to be simply shallow holes inhabited by bats and swallows.\n\n54. At 10 a.m. started for Tamborongah. Our guide Lumbag led us through the jungle by an imaginary path up and down hills, crossing the Kadamayan and sundry small streams. At 12.55 we emerged out of the jungle and had a good view of the surroundings from the crest of a hill 6,077 feet high. Gawang and his party were observed toiling up the hill below us, so we hurried on, and ten minutes after arrived at Tamborongah. This may have been, ages ago, the site of a mountain village, but at the present day there are only two small huts usually called sulap without walls and thatched with leaves. The thermometer registered $55^\\circ$. As the rain had just stopped, my followers were wet and paralys-\ned with the cold, so I had myself to make a well to receive the tiny rivulet which oozed out of a marsh close at hand.\n\n55. GAWANG, stupid GAWANG, had only brought up about 25 catties of rice and only 4 small rolls of tobacco, and I naturally blessed him and his coolies heartily. It simply meant partial starvation (twenty-two men accompanied me to Kinabalu cave (Paka-Paka), for this rice had to provide us with our only meal this day, one to-morrow and one the next day, or else to return. I here take the opportunity of stating that the Tuaran Dusuns are superior to their neighbours, for they never even grumbled once at the commissariat, which department was woefully defective and although they were half starved, always carried their loads manfully and never suggested a retreat. GAWANG had also brought up a white fowl and a few paltry brass goods intended as propitiatory offerings to the spirits on Kinabalu.\n\n56. When we arrive at Paka-Paka cave, to-morrow, we are not to mention the word \"Kinabalu\" or wish for sunshine, for if we do so it will anger those mighty spirits that punishment follows in the shape of torrents of rain, and if we spread out cloths, a violent gust of wind will be the result.\n\n57. I had my tent erected and slept inside with Pangeran SAHBUDIN and a boatman. I should say tried to sleep, for our damp wood fire caused us terrible torture. My tent was made in Singapore by McALISTER & Co., and I give them every credit for turning out a good article which has withstood all vicissitudes of weather.\n\n58. Next morning I took several compass bearings, Maunkan Island near Gaya W. \u00bd S., Kuala Mengkabong W. by N., thermometer height of Tamborongah 7,328 feet.\n\n59. Started at 7.40 a.m. by a fair path compared to yesterday's. The old guide and three coolies left us to return to Kiau and bring up more rice and await our return at Tamborongah. We passed several places covered with ferns, from which a good view might have been obtainable, had the mist cleared. We stopped to smoke a cigarette at 8,643 feet. The air was very cold and kept so for a long way up. A short way above, the path crossed a marshy spot but I did not notice the tracks of any beast. In fact life seems to be\nnon-existent in these high growing jungles, for during the whole trip from Mitimbok gorge to the top and back, our party only saw two birds, a species of starling and a swallow.\n\n60. I have forgotten to describe the splendid pitcher plants and pretty blue and white flowers which we passed, and, what pleased my eye better I must confess, quantities of large gutta-percha trees, india-rubber vines and rattans. The latter were rather too plentiful, especially the thorny rattan (Malay *iting*) and our hands bore its traces for more than a week afterwards. I imagine the thorns are poisonous.\n\n61. We had no cliff climbing to do to-day, but had to be careful in picking our steps, for the moss covered roots offered a treacherous foothold at best and when walking quickly a leg would disappear up to the thigh in some hole. Coming down an incline I received a terrible bump from a low branch stretching across the path, but the cold air soon took away a severe headache which followed.\n\n62. The moss up here is of different shades of crimson, and retains a quantity of ice cold moisture. Nine thousand feet or thereabouts appears to be the highest limit reached by the rattan either the marketable or thorny species.\n\n63. Dilana Hill, or it may be spelt according to the Dusun rules of syntax, \"Da Lana\" (that is Lana with the article *da*) is a much more important hill than Kinabalu, for on its eastern side are the sources of the Sugut and Labuk rivers. The path led us over the top and I ascertained the height to be 9,700 feet, and taking the length of the former river at 130 miles, this gives an average fall of 1 in 70, which will equally apply to the Labuk river.\n\n64. The Sugut river allows even heavily laden dug-outs to be poled up as far as Langsat, 105 miles by water from its mouth, I therefore hope on a future journey to the east side of Kinabalu to be able to give an impetus to the already large export trade in jungle produce which leaves that river and in a lesser amount, the Labuk.\n\n65. We then descended into a hollow, but soon had to climb up the true \"trunk\" of Kinabalu as the natives say. Almost on a level with Dilana top, I came to a bleak spot, covered with coarse *heather* and where numerous boulders\nlay on every side. Here we rested for a few minutes and enjoyed a cup of cold tea. During the next half hour, we had to crawl under and over fallen trees and finally arrived at Paka-Paka cave at 12.15 p.m., height 10,262 feet, thermometer 58\u00b0.\n\n66. At 1 p.m. the sun broke out, but no view could be got, owing to the thick mist. Soon the rain began to fall, and in a few minutes the Kadamayan, which had been a shallow stream running past the entrance to our cave, became a roaring torrent bounding over the large boulders in its bed. Equally soon the stream subsided when the rain stopped.\n\n67. Paka-Paka cave is a shallow hole scooped out of a hornblende cliff by the adjacent stream. Its floor is earthy and covered over with charred wood from deer-hunter's fires. The entrance was partially blocked up with my tent, and three fires were lighted. My mat occupied the back part of the cave remote from the fires, as I could not endure the smoke torture of last night again. The Dyaks and Kiau men slept on a ledge of the cave, warmed by the smoke, and the rest disposed themselves around the fire. I put on an extra suit of drill clothes, singlet and stockings and over all my water-proof coat, lending my blanket to Pangeran Sahbudin, who had fever; and in spite of my precautions did not sleep a wink. There was an entrance for the cold wind, and the thermometer registered 52\u00b0 at 5.30 a.m. inside the cave.\n\n68. I asked for volunteers in the morning, obtaining eleven who wished to accompany me up to the summit. Their names were written on a page of a note-book and put in an empty (alas!) bottle of three-star Hennessey's brandy. The cork was secured by thread and candle grease. The names were, Pangeran Sahbudin, Government Chief in charge; Police Constables Nanggai and Nehangan, and a Dusun relation; Jemain, Somah, Pangolin, Mapadri, coolies; Gawan, two guides (Limbawan and Tambias), and myself; twelve in all.\n\n69. We started at 7 a.m. After twenty minutes' climb passed out of the thick jungle, having had constantly to clear the obliterated path with low branches on every side, and came to the granite face of Kinabalu. I managed to\nwalk up with my shoes, but found it dangerous, so took them off. The easiest slope lay up the tiny rivulet representing the Kadamayan or Tampasuk source. We stopped at 10,712 feet and had a view of the waves of mountains below bounded by the Labuk sea on one side and Papar on the other. My compass bearings were, East Coast, sea S. E. by E., Gaya W. S. W., Sindatun hill S. E. by E., which would prove that I was ascending the south side of the mountain. The granite face is very regular, except in the vicinity of the peaks, and is only occasionally varied by small clumps of twisted stunted trees somewhat like firs in the matter of foliage.\n\n70. We first had to scramble towards the eastern side, then towards the West, finally straight up to the summit, arriving at 10.10 a.m. in a very cold and hungry condition. Owing to the thick mist, we had some difficulty in overtaking our guides and Gawang. On rejoining them, I was rather disappointed to hear that they had just been up the peak which St. John ascended in 1858 and which ranks as No. 2 in height. I enquired if they had seen Low's bottle but Gawang answered entah, meaning \"who knows?\"\n\n71. We were sitting in the gap between Victoria Peak the highest and most easterly, and the adjacent peak, which the Kiau men have just climbed. A piercing wind was blowing in furious gusts through the gap and our hands were numbed with the cold. I took my pocket aneroid out, and was surprised to see it only gave 11,312 feet above sea level as the height of the summit. Thermometer registered 54\u00b0. The sun was shining brightly, but it failed to dispel the mists below. Victoria Peak I calculated to be 250 feet high, and the next peak to the W. (St. John's Peak) about 100 feet in height, so the aneroid height plus 250 should give the total height of our \"show mountain\" 11,562 feet, or over 2,000 feet lower than the usually accepted height 13,698 feet.\n\n72. I advanced to the edge of the abyss and looked down and saw a gulf of unfathomable depth whose bottom was lost in mist. Then, a policeman ran forward and pulled me back saying I was sitting on a wall of loose stones which created a feeble laugh for it would require a lever to lift the square\nblocks of this ancient parapet. Pangeran Sahbudin informed me he saw the last or fourth side of this gulf, which I required in order to work out the volcanic theory. A momentary clearing of the mist had revealed the further rim of this crater, far below us. There must have been two great eruptions in former ages. The first, burst through the rim of the crater on our side (the southern), and left fragments now represented by the peaks; the second broke away the northern or further rim and reduced its height. Could not the smooth face of the gigantic granite slabs, all at the same angle, be explained by reason of friction from a mighty flow of lava?\n\n73. That Borneo or even British North Borneo has not been volcanic is incorrect, for Mr. Resident Davies has obtained lava specimens, and I found some in a stream on Mallawalli Island in 1886, which I submitted to Mr. A. H. Everett, who was on a visit up coast at the time.\n\n74. I was disappointed that Victoria Peak was inaccessible and when I asked for volunteers to come up with me to the top of St. John's peak, I received no response and did not press the matter, determining to get to the top of Victoria Peak some other day. We hurriedly sacrificed the fowl, and started down when Gawang said he would go up St. John's Peak and lay my bottle and the brassware on its summit\u2014which was done and he soon overtook us.\n\n75. When 209 feet down, the mist around Victoria Peak cleared away and we noticed that its side facing the East was at a moderate angle, and quite capable of being ascended. But the gruesome mist was again creeping around us and our empty stomachs warned us not to delay on the road, so we left the feat till next occasion, but not without regret.\n\n76. By this time my stockings were worn out but the granite was just rough enough to prevent sudden slips without wounding the feet; occasionally, in the crevices, one came on a few jagged fragments and a contortion of the features showed an unwary step, but on the whole I preferred descending to our late toil going up. Down the steeper inclined slabs, the Dyaks assisted me, holding a hand a piece and only once, near the jungle, did I fall on my back, nearly dashing\nmy brains out against the rock.\n\n77. When we passed along the slimy, water-covered granite where one of Sir H. Low's coolies slipped and nearly rolled down a precipice, we only had a sharp edged crevice to walk on, but a look downwards made us forget the pain. I picked several specimens of mountain lilies, the British North Borneo fir and some of the \"ghostly buffalo\" grass on the way, and had a long drink from the ice cold spring which flows out as the Tampasuk or Kadamayan River. I have omitted to mention that the lofty peak seen by St. John S. \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) E. from the summit, is probably Trus Madai hill in the interior of Padas, bearing from our point of view S. W. by S. I am not certain but that this hill may be Madai hill in Bawel bay.\n\n78. On arriving at the jungle, the rainy mists were dispelled by a brilliant burst of sunshine and I felt rather warm, being obliged to take off an extra singlet. The thermometer registered 69\u00b0 in a spot sheltered from the wind. We arrived at the cave at 12.30 p.m. and were glad to see our less active followers had at any rate prepared a meal, which we attacked with the appetite of men who have been starving for 29 hours. Meanwhile, our loose baggage was being packed and when ready, I despatched half the men with it, with orders to await us at Tambarongah. I informed my men that I should give two cents for every perfect pitcher plant and other prices for other plants if brought safely to Kiau.\n\n79. We started at 4.45 p.m. and although we pushed on, my strained knee prevented much progress. Before reaching our camp I had to light candles, but we got along without accidents. To-day we have gone through 8\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) hours' hard walking and climbing and I was not surprised to find myself seized with severe cramps in both legs after supper.\n\n80. Datoh Benawa, Bunahow and Tampulan from Kiau gave me all the local news on arrival. They had brought up rice and tobacco as arranged.\n\n81. We started late the next day, not leaving before 9 a.m. and took the path Gawang had used, which follows the left bank of the Kadamayan. The hill was very steep, and slippery from the tracks of the preceding coolies. My knee\ngot worse and my progress slower every minute, so I sent on most of the men and followed at my leisure. Had a narrow escape from falling down a precipice, owing to a rotten branch breaking, of which I had hold. The outer end was brought up by a projecting stone and allowed me to recover my balance. I found my men waiting at Labong stream, under a overhanging cliff of conglomerate and crystal. They had arrived there in three hours from Tamborongah. The thermometer registered $64^\\circ$. I felt completely crippled and sore all over.\n\n82. The thermometer fell to $61^\\circ$ at 6 a.m. We started at 9 a.m. following down the Labong for some distance. Left the stream where the water-falls commence and struck up the left bank going S.W. by W. towards the Kadamayan. Crossed a tiny stream, Sungei Solawk\u00f4n, at 11.25 a.m., arrived at noon at the Kadamayan and after our meal started down the river at a quick pace, fearing floods as the river was rising. Stopped again at Mitimbok gorge and finally arrived in Kiau at 6 p.m. putting up at Bunahow's house.\n\n83. Here Limbawan, my guide, informed me through Gawang, that he had brought down Messrs. Low and St. John's papers; the former's in a bottle and the latter's in a tin. I felt vexed at his having deceived me, but said nothing and exchanged another bottle for the one in question. From the tin, a small cocoa or chocolate and milk one, I withdrew a piece of the Overland Mail dated January 9th, 1858, which contained a page torn from a pocket diary on which was written in pencil: the peak here with the bottle\n\nSpenser St. John.\n\nApril 30th, 1858.\n\n84. In the bottle, probably an old Bass' beer bottle, I found fragments of The Agricultural Gazette and The Gardener's Chronicle, but the dated side is missing; also a pencil memo. with the words: Govern (ment) (La) buan do 5 Bar (ometer) was still distinguishable. Mr. Low (now Sir H. Low) made the ascent of Kinabalu in 1851; so, I suppose, both bottle and papers must be over thirty-six years old and have successfully withstood gales, rains and mists during that time.\n85. The Kiau natives now killed the cow for which before a goat had been substituted during the ceremony consequent on taking the oath of friendship.\n\n86. Bayer, the father of Bunahow, we found to be a talkative old man; in fact I dropped off to sleep and when I awoke he was still declaiming.\n\n87. The wild raspberry grows in abundance on the village green, but the natives do not utilize it. During our walk yesterday the Dyaks found \"Libu\" creeper, as they call it, which, they sentimentally said, reminded them of the fragrant breath of the Dyak women. This, I believe, is the creeper whose leaves steeped in warm water are used as a substitute for tea by the Orang Sungei (Sulu refugees) of Labuk and Tongud. At Nyot Tonggal in 1883, a village on the latter river, I drank many cups of this \"tea\" and did not dislike the taste.\n\n88. Bunahow's brother has a shrunken leg and is sitting next to me and employing himself shredding tobacco leaves. The leaves are of medium size and unbroken. In cutting, the performer uses a long bamboo knife and, to prevent accidents, has a bamboo joint on his left thumb which keeps the leaves steady on a three-legged stool, representing the block. The tobacco is afterwards made into rolls which are folded into a parcel 14\" by 3\" by 2\" deep. This, I subsequently heard, was sold four to the fathom of black cloth or 4\u00bd cents each.\n\n89. Tambias, our late guide, informs me that he stood and watched cave swallows flying in clouds out of Bukit Simparuan, one day's journey from Kiau. Tambias I found to be an intelligent young man and I believe his report, but as the Kiau men appear to be coming to the end of their rice, and provisions are five times dearer than in Tuaran, I postpone prospecting for the cave.\n\n90. In the evening, Si Guras, a sister of Bunahow's, entertained us to Ingano. When the Hill Dusuns sing, they prefer to lie on their backs saying they are more comfortable in this position. Since my return I have informed our Medical Officer of the fact, and he says that there is an anatomical reason for this, as the lungs have more play than\nwhen a singer is standing.\n\n91. All the houses here have sloping bamboos up to the front verandah, instead of steps or a notched log; and in consequence, the men near the door are disturbed by porkers during the night.\n\n92. Started 7.35 a.m. on the 20th March and returned to Labong Labong at 10.20 a.m. and had our noon-day meal at Tampulan's house. I bought some honey in the comb, a rather common delicacy amongst the Hill Dusuns, for each house has a bees' nest attached to the side of the window close to the sleeping dais.\n\n93. Karaing, Tampulan's wife, was as cheerful as ever, and asked me to bring up sundry brass jewelry next time I came up.\n\n94. Left for Kahong and crossed the Kadamayan twice. At Kahong ford the water was waist deep and every moment rising. We put up at Lampayan's house, the coolies as usual finding their own quarters. The next morning Tampulan arrived and stated that he was coming with me. Directly afterwards I went to bathe and noticed Tampulan being belaboured by a woman. I thought he had been \"larking,\" but the enraged female turned out to be his wife who insisted on his following her back and he had to go.\n\n95. Started down the Kadamayan or Tampasuk (the river St. John calls Kalopis is the above) at 11 a.m., and took the path following the river, crossed several small streams and twice the Kadamayan. At the last ford opposite Dilongan Tipud hill, the river was breast deep and forty yards wide and being in flood we thought some one would come to grief, so tried to stretch a rattan across, but the first man who attempted the passage broke the rattan and just escaped being dashed among the rapids below. The Hill Dusuns then crossed by lightly hopping with the current from one foot to the other. We all followed suit and I can state that I shall never trouble myself about deep rivers in flood again, for provided the water is not above one's head, or the rocks too close, nothing can be easier than to cross in this manner.\n\n96. Rain commenced as we were crossing and continued\nup to 3 p.m., when we arrived at Tambatuan village after trudging up a long and greasy hill. The clay hills of Tuaran are terribly annoying after a shower of rain. I remember constantly making four or five unsuccessful attempts in the path.\n\n97. The headman LINTAID's house was leaky, so we put up at LIMBUN's long house of three doors. To arrive here ST. JOHN must have used another path, for he only crossed the Kadamayan twice near Dilongan Tipud hill after making a d\u00e9tour to the east.\n\n98. LINTAID excused himself coming as he was roasting two monkeys he had snared. Next morning, the 22nd March, I wrote to Mr. WHITEHEAD, who was still at Melangkap, lower down. Started for the coast at 11.30 a.m. At the last moment LINTAID rushed up saying he had been again roasting monkeys and wished to speak to me, but I refused and left the wretch to revel in more monkeys if he liked. GAWANG had persuaded me to visit this village saying LINTAID wished to come down with me, but he seems to have changed his mind. At 6 a.m. thermometer $70^\\circ$, aneroid 1,752 feet.\n\n99. We crossed the Tampasuk river or Kadamayan beyond the gravelly stretch below Tambatuan, and toiled up a long steep hill making a path through tall grass and, on arrival at the top, were of course bathed in perspiration. A coolie from Tamperuli in Tuaran became prostrated from fever and it was with great difficulty I induced anyone to carry him even with the promise of a dollar. Shortly afterwards the carriers struck work, but had to come to their senses, for, when I remonstrated with the grumblers, and myself shouldered the sick man, as a proof of his lightness a strapping Dusun hoisted him up on his back and walked quietly down hill with his load.\n\n100. The rain commenced as usual in torrents and we hurried on, finding shelter in a small padi hut of larger dimensions than usual. The Dyaks walked on saying they would get quarters ready at the nearest village whose coconut trees were visible afar off and dimly through the mist as \"through a glass darkly.\"\n\n101. We lighted fires in the meantime and stripped our\npatient making him wear my water-proof coat, that being the only dry article in our possession. After a while he was better. Shortly after the rain had stopped Police Constable NCHANGAN appeared and led us down through padi fields and along the Lemawng stream to Lemawng village. We arrived there at 4.30 p.m. putting up at MUSAH\u2019s house, and congratulated ourselves at being again amongst the coast Dusuns.\n\n102. Lemawng village possesses two houses and pays $10 poll-tax per annum through SI AHMAT of Madang. Lemawng stream is a tributary of the Sungei Damit, which flows into the Tuaran river near Along.\n\n103. I gave MUSAH a tin box which had contained cigarettes and he presented me in return with some honey and sweet potatoes.\n\n104. Started next morning at 6.40 a.m. The sick coolie preceded us part of the way, but was soon left behind to follow on with his brother-in-law at their leisure. After crossing the Lemawng seven times, we ascended a hill, arriving at Ginambor Bundoh village at 8 a.m. and then crossed the Sungei Damit nine times, arriving at Rungus Manuntun village at 11.45 a.m. From here to Madang we had simply to wallow through a buffalo path occasionally varied by clay hills. Arrived at Madang at 12.45 p.m. At 4 p.m. Pangeran SAHBUDIN and I borrowed AHMAT\u2019s gobong (dug-out) and paddled down to Tapakawn, the others walked via Teg\u00e2s hill to reach the same village, only eight, however, arriving that night.\n\n105. Next morning, 24th March, the river was in high flood, but the rain had stopped, and waiting till all our men had arrived, we started at 8 a.m. Several times crossing tributaries, we were obliged to swim and wade breast deep, but nothing seemed to delay us and in four hours we had traversed the distance between Tampakawn and Tando, the Government station.\n\n106. Since my return to the coast, the headman BUNAHOW and the guides TAMBIAS and LIMBAWAN, Datoh BENAWA TOKIL and a follower from the interior of Sulaman, have paid me a visit and I brought them to Gaya and Kudat by\nboat sending them back in the S. S. Paknam. They have seen His Excellency the Governor, the Resident, and several other Europeans, including a lady, so they ought to be satisfied and civilised now.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nThere is little doubt but the Tampasuk route to Kinabalu is the longest and by no means the easiest.\n\nThe following plans of march may be of assistance to others wishing to explore the mountain, and I have proved that coolies are easily obtainable in Tuaran, which they are not in Tampasuk even under high wages.\n\nLabuan to Gaya Island by S. S. Paknam eight hours, or by steam-launch Bujang Baram, under special favour of Mr. A. H. Everett, the Consul for Sarawak; or by boat two days' sail.\n\nGaya Island to Borongis, Tuaran, via Mengkabong by boat six hours and across plain to Buntai two hours' walk.\n\nBuntai Village to Sinilau Village $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours' walk\u2014hills.\n\nSinilau Village to Bungol Village $8\\frac{1}{2}$ hours' walk\u2014hills.\n\nBungol Village to Labong Labong Village 6 hours' walk\u2014hills.\n\nLabong Labong Village to Kiau Village $2\\frac{3}{4}$ hours' walk\u2014hills.\n\nor\n\nGaya Island by boat to Government station, Tuaran, six hours.\n\nStation to Madang Village eight hours' flat walking.\n\nLemawng Village to Tambatuan Village five hours' (hill) (on the Tampasuk River).\n\nTambatuan Village to Labong Labong Village five hours' (flat) (on the Tampasuk River).\n\nLabong Labong Village to Kiau $2\\frac{3}{4}$ hours (hill) (on the Tampasuk River).\n\nThe first route is the quickest by a day and requires no crossing of rivers between the Tuaran and Tampasuk, whereas the latter abounds in it.\n\nR. M. LITTLE.\nPULAU LANGKAWI.\n\nThese are bold islands, formed of and flanked by towering masses of limestone. I could find but few tracts of level ground upon these islands. They are dependencies of the Siamese Government of Kedah.* This is all that Colonel Low, in 1849, found to write of this beautiful group of islands, and there is little other printed information about them. Situated in Lat. $6^\\circ 10'$ to $6^\\circ 27'$ North, and Long. $99^\\circ 37'$ to $99^\\circ 56'$ East, about seventy miles due north of Penang, they are clearly visible on a fine day from the top of Penang Hill, and the curious configuration of their limestone peaks, so unlike the ordinary scenery of the Straits of Malacca, invite exploration. Some notes, which I made during a cruise round the Langkawi Islands in December, 1887, enabled me to correct and supplement the geographical information contained in the latest Admiralty charts of this locality, as far as the native names of places are concerned, and I print them here, with a map, for the information of future travellers.\n\nH. H. the Raja of Kedah (whose capital we had been visiting), as soon as he learned that our tour was to include the Langkawi Islands, kindly proposed to accompany us (my brother, Mr. R. W. Maxwell, and myself), and to show us all the places of interest there. He declined, however, a passage in the Sea Bird, and brought his own steamer, with Wan Mat Saman, his Chief Minister, and a few other followers in attendance. We left the mouth of the Kedah River on the morning of December 26th, and steered direct for the East entrance\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., III, 8.\nof Bass' Straits, and entering a land-locked harbour reached a shallow bay, on the shore of which is the principal village of the island\u2014a place named Kwah. Here, we were informed, there is a considerable population of both Malays and Chinese, principally fishermen. There is a certain amount of cultivation, and the paddy-fields inland are said to be extensive. We did not land, but steamed on through the strait, having the main island on our right and the island of Dayang Bunting on our left. Just opposite the village of Kwah across the strait are the limestone cliffs of Tanjong Tirei (on Dayang Bunting), very precipitous, and immediately behind the village, but far inland, rises the conical peak of Gunong Raya, the highest point in the island, about 2,900 feet high. Fishing stakes here and there in the strait and an occasional kampong on the shores of the main island gave evidence of the presence of a Malay population, and now and then we passed a fishing boat, or a Chinese trading junk with picturesque brown sails.\n\nPresently a view was opened up to the northward of a long serrated ridge with fifteen or twenty peaks, which the Malays call Gunong Chinchang, or the \"chopped mountain,\" from its supposed resemblance to a board in the edge of which deep indentations have been cut with a hatchet.\n\nOn the South coast of Pulau Langkawi there are the following places between Kwah and Tanjong Sawah, which we passed in the order in which their names are given:\u2014Kl\u00e9bang, T\u00e9pah, Langkana, T\u00e9moyang (river and small kampong), and Teluk Baharu. On the coast of Dayang Bunting opposite, we passed Batu Uban, Tanjong Lilit, and the limestone cliffs of Goa Langsiah, where there is a cave. Here, we were told, grows in profusion a ground orchid with a yellow flower in great demand among collectors. The islanders had, it appeared, recently learned that it possesses a money value, owing to the visit of a collector, who paid a cent a-piece for specimens. I have since ascertained that the plant in question is the *Cypripedium Nivium*.\n\nThe scenery hereabouts is very striking. The fantastic shapes of the limestone cliffs and peaks of Dayang Bunting, the islets dotted about in the strait, the smooth expanse of deep blue water, and the distant ranges of Gunong Raya and\nGunong Chinchang, make up a picture not to be equalled anywhere in the Straits of Malacca.\n\nThe islets in the strait are called Pulau K\u00e9dra, and the following are some of the names of the numerous islands to the West of Pulau Dayang Bunting:\u2014Pulau Chupak (very small), Pulau Gubang, Pulau Jong, Telam Banton, Pulau Singha, and Pulau Bras Basah.\n\nTo the North nearer to the shores of the main island, are Pulau Lalang, Pulau Ular, and Pulau Hantu.\n\nSteaming out of the strait and leaving Pulau Hantu on the right, we sighted Pulau Adang in the distance, far out to sea, bearing about N. N. W. This island is famous for its turtle.\n\nThen, passing between Pulau T\u00ebpur and Tanjong Sawah (the S. W. point of the main island), we steamed on past two islands\u2014Pulau R\u00ebbah\u2014and headed for Tanjong Bongkok Penny\u00fa, called on the chart \u201cThe Dolphin\u2019s Nose.\u201d This is a bold headland, the end of the Gunong Chinchang range, with a hump on the top of it. There are fishing stakes in the straits between the islands above-mentioned and Pulau Langkawi, and small settlements on the coast of the latter. Round the fishing stakes, flocks of gulls (ch\u00ebnchamar) were wheeling. Nearly opposite Pulau R\u00ebbah is Tanjong Padikik.\n\nEntering the bay on the South side of Tanjong Bongkok Penny\u00fa, we dropped anchor in deep water not far from shore. This place is called by the Malays Burau, which is a corruption of two Siamese words bor ran, \u201cold well\u201d; a walk of about a mile and a half through the jungle, ending with a steep climb, brings one out on a face of precipitous rock, through which a mountain torrent has worn itself a channel. Here we see the \u201cwell,\u201d or series of wells (the Malays say there are seven and call the place t\u00e9laga tujoh), from which the Siamese name originated.\n\nNo longer in the bed of the stream, which has probably shifted, as the rock has been worn down under the attrition of centuries, there are here and there deep circular holes which seem to have been cut out with sufficient accuracy to excuse the natives of these parts for supposing that they are the work of mankind. But the stream close by has doubtless been the\nagency, in some former period, when the rocks were not quite as we now see them, and when the \"old well\" was at the foot of some small cascade and was gradually hollowed out with the accuracy with which a hole is made in a Stilton by a cheese-scoop.\n\nOn the morning of the 27th, after another visit to the shore for a morning bath in the river, we continued our cruise round the island. The coast scenery hereabouts is very fine. Steep cliffs rise sheer from the water's edge, the bare rocks below gradually merging into slopes, clothed with jungle above. There is not a sign of cultivation or of a human habitation, and the whole of the Gunong Chinchang range is, I fancy, unexplored and unvisited save when some of the more adventurous of the population climb for the wild bees' nests in the crannies of the limestone cliffs. The wax is a royal perquisite, and the daring climbers get only a small proportion of their actual take. We passed Sungei Tama Kechil, a gorge in the hills, and, further on, Tanjong Besar. Here our course was nearly due north, with Pulau Terutau, a very large island, right ahead. A shoal of pomfret (ikan bawal), one of the best fish that the Bay of Bengal produces, occasioned some excitement among our crew, but we were not equipped for a fishing expedition. The presence of a boat (sampan pukat) off Tanjong Chin-chin shewed that this is a well-known fishing ground. A cave near the water's edge called Lobang Chin-chin, \"the cave of the ring,\" was pointed out, but what the legend concerning it is, we did not learn. After passing Tukun Raja we altered our course and headed eastward, with Pulau Terutau on our port bow. A singular-looking island off Pulau Terutau, resembling a ruined castle, is called Pulau Bel\u00e9tong, and the edible birds' nests of Chinese commerce are said to be found there. Beyond it is Pulau Burong.\n\nWith the mountains of S\u00e9tul in view on the mainland in front of us, we passed in turn the following places on the coast of Pulau Langkawi:\u2014Tanjong Temb\u00fan, Teluk T\u00f3ma, Sungei Gatal, Langgara (a river here), Tanjong Temburun, Tanjong Pembuta, Pulau Jemburong, Kuala Kubang Badak, Sungei Ewa, Pulau Dangli (small islets), Oo (where\nthere are said to be paddy-fields), Pulau Kasin (a distant islet to the North is called Pulau Kweh), and Tanjong Gamarau. Here there is a bay where there are said to be hot springs; the island in the bay is called Pulau B\u00eblibis.\n\nPassing Tanjong Gamarau, with Gunong Raya in the distance bearing nearly due South, and an island called Pulau Tanjong Dundang right ahead, we came to an anchor nearly opposite our destination\u2014Goa Cherita. The coast scenery about here is very fine, an endless series of fantastic peaks furnishing perpetual variety.\n\nGoa Cherita is traditionally reputed to be the cave in which, according to the early history of Kedah, the shipwrecked Prince of R\u00fam was hidden and tended by his future wife\u2014the daughter of the Emperor of China. The story may be read in the chronicles of Kedah, called Marong Mahawangsa, an inferior English translation of which (by Colonel Low) is to be found in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago, Vol. III. The legend is briefly as follows:\n\nThe island of Langkapuri, after the war between Rama and Rawana, celebrated in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, was little frequented, and in later ages became the home of the bird Garuda (pronounced by Malays Gerda)\u2014the eagle of Vishnu. Gerda learnt that a marriage was projected between the son of the Emperor of R\u00fam and the daughter of the Emperor of China, and, in order to prevent the aggrandisement of the former empire, thought it desirable to prevent the match. So he presented himself before God's prophet Suleiman, who then ruled the world and all created things, not only mankind, but all spirits (jin, peri, dewa and mambang), and all animals on the face of the earth. He represented the necessity of preventing the young couple from meeting, but King Solomon declared that no power on earth could prevent it. On this, Gerda announced that he could and would prevent it, and vowed that, if unsuccessful, he would for ever abandon the haunts of men. The prophet bade him do his worst and come back and relate the story of his success when it should have been accomplished.\n\nGerda then successfully swooped down upon the garden of the Emperor of China, and carried off in his talons the princess and two female attendants, whom he set down in safety on\nhis island\u2014Langkapuri. Next he attacked and sunk the fleet in which the young Prince of R\u00fam, under the guidance of a trusted minister named Marong Mahawangsa, was sailing for the capital of China to be united to his betrothed. The scene of the shipwreck was on the eastern side of the Bay of Bengal, and the prince, who clung to a plank, was cast on shore on the island of Langkapuri. Here, one day, he was found by the princess of China and her attendants, who hid him in a cave, and carefully concealed from the bird Gerda the fact of his presence. The d\u00e9nouement is easily guessed. When Gerda appeared before King Solomon to boast that he had carried out his determination, the prophet despatched a jin to Pulau Langkapuri, and had the prince, the princess and their attendants conveyed in a chest to his audience hall, where Gerda was put to shame, and the inutility of attempting to resist the course of pre-ordained fate was demonstrated.\n\nThe chronicler of Kedah, which, by the way, was colonised by the minister of the Emperor of R\u00fam\u2014Marong Mahawangsa\u2014seems to have been sufficiently satisfied that Pulau Langkapuri, the scene of the wars of Rama and Rawana, was identical with the island off the coast of Kedah which the Malays now call Langkawi, and which may have been called Langkapuri in former times. And successive generations of Kedah Malays have, no doubt, been ignorant of the identity of Lanka with Ceylon, and have contentedly localised their legend in an island of their own. So it is not surprising that the islanders are still able to point out the very cave in which the prince of R\u00fam was hidden from his enemy\u2014the bird Gerda, who in former times had taken part in the wars of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana.\n\nWe landed in a sandy bay between two rocky headlands, and viewed the cave, which is principally remarkable for an inscription in Malay carved in the rock at a height of some twelve feet from the ground. It has been much injured by exposure to the weather, but seems to record the visit of some Raja 240 years ago, if the date A. H. 1060, which occurs in the inscription, is to be taken as the date when it was written and not of some past event commemorated at a later period. Perhaps, with some trouble, a better conjecture as to the\nnature of the inscription than I was able to make may be arrived at. I give below the opening sentences as far as they are decipherable; of the remainder only a word here and there can be made out.\n\nThere is an upper chamber in the cave to which the Raja and I climbed by means of a boat's mast and a rope, but there is little there to repay curiosity. Some enormous stalactites hang suspended at the entrance of the lower cave, but how the princess and her attendants managed to close the mouth of it with stones, as the Kedah chronicler represents them to have done, is not apparent to the modern visitor.\n\nWe quitted this beautiful island with regret, wishing that it had been possible to learn something of the interior. We passed Teluk Udang and then Sungei Kilin, where there is a creek between two headlands of the usual limestone type. Not far from this there is a curious island\u2014Pulau Petukang\u2014which looks like a wall of masonry; next, beyond a rocky promontory, Tanjong Beluru, a point covered with mangrove, came in sight, and passing Sungei Kisap, where Chinese have established themselves and cut firewood for export to Penang, we emerged into open water at Tanjong Dagu opposite to Tanjong Tumbus on Pulau Dundang.\n\nLeaving this at 4 P.M., we reached Penang in the Sea Bird at midnight.\n\nW. E. MAXWELL.\nTHE NEGRI SEMBILAN\n\nTHEIR ORIGIN AND CONSTITUTION.\n\nThe history of these States has been handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation of the inhabitants. It is difficult to say how long ago it was that a great number of S\u00e1kei* travelled from the mountains of Sk\u00fadei\u2020 and arrived in Joh\u00f3l. Their numbers amounted to as many grains as are contained in a gantang\u2021 of paddy, as on their arrival in Joh\u00f3l each individual planted a grain of paddy, and it was found that a gantang was exhausted. They tied a r\u00f3tan\u00a7 from tree to tree and hung up their b\u0113liungs (the small Malay axe) and the r\u00f3tan was completely filled. This latter statement, however, is one which conveys little idea of the numbers, as the distance between the trees is not given. There were four great Chiefs, or B\u00e1tins, amongst these S\u00e1kei. Three were men and one a woman. The woman elected to remain in Joh\u00f3l. The three men separated with their followers; one went to J\u011bl\u011bbu\u2016, one to Klang, and one to Sungei Ujong. These are the Suku yang ampat, and are the origin of the Undang yang ampat, the four law-givers, of which Klang\n\n---\n\n* 'S\u00e1kei', a dog. But the term is not applied to the tribes described in this paper by the surrounding Malays. I have not heard it further South than S\u00e9l\u00e1ngor.\n\u2020 The S\u00e9k\u00fadei stream takes its rise in the P\u00falei range.\n\u2021 A gallon measure.\n\u00a7 i.e., 'rattan,' 'rautan' from 'raut' to scrape.\n\u2016 Said to mean 'mist.'\n\nD. F. A. H.\nwas the Chief or oldest and which will be referred to later as the development of the constitution is dealt with.\n\nIt would now appear that these Chiefs assigned various districts either to their relations or to the lesser Chiefs who had accompanied them. The lesser Chiefs again separated to N\u00e1n\u00ecng,* R\u011bmbau, J\u011blei\u2020 (Pahang), S\u011bg\u00e1mat, and P\u00e1sir B\u011bs\u00e1r. These completed the nine States of the N\u011bgri S\u011bmbilan. This fact is generally known, though considerable incredulity has always been expressed with regard to J\u011blei in Pahang, detached as it is from the remaining eight States.\n\nThus these S\u00e1kei were established in the nine States, and their power and numbers appear to have been considerable. A fact that has much struck me both here and in P\u00e9arak and S\u011bl\u00e1ngor is the pronunciation of the final k by S\u00e1kei when talking Malay. This pronunciation is not within the memory of Malays in the Peninsula, and it is quite possible that this great number of S\u00e1kei who arrived from Sk\u00fadei, came originally from Borneo,\u2021 and made Sk\u00fadei their last halting place before travelling on to Johol and separating throughout the Peninsula.\n\nThe next chapter in this history, unconnected as it is by dates, is the arrival of Mahomedan settlers from M\u011bnangk\u00e1bau in Sumatra. There must have been very free immigration, and that within a short period, and the policy pursued by these settlers was one of conciliation with the aborigines, and not as in P\u00e9arak and S\u011bl\u00e1ngor, where the S\u00e1kei were driven back into the mountains, and their wives and children caught and enslaved by the Mahomedan settlers on\n\n* A stinging insect of the bee kind.\n\u2020 Name of a creeper.\n\u2021 Primary origin in Java.\n\nD.

These M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau settlers brought their tribal laws with them\u2014the illegality of intermarriage in a tribe, the election of the Lemb\u00e1ga,* or Chief of a tribe, etc.\n\nThey fell in with the aboriginal views, and observed their rights to all waste lands, and their power in each State.\n\nThe best instance of the lines pursued by these settlers, and their amalgamation with the S\u00e1kei, is that Sri M\u00e9n\u00e1nti. of the first settlers at Sri M\u00e9n\u00e1nti and \u00dalu Muar, then a part of Joh\u00f3l. Four settlers arrived with their families, each belonging to a different tribe. Their names were Pad\u00faka B\u00e9s\u00e1r, Engkei\u2020 Bongsu, S\u00e9n\u00e1ra M\u00fada and Si Maharaja. As they travelled to the \u00dalu of the Muar River, they came on a valley where they found the paddy in the ear, ripe, and they resolved to settle there, and called the name of the place Sri M\u00e9n\u00e1nti. Sri is the M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau word for the ripe paddy, \u2021 M\u00e9n\u00e1nti \u201cawaiting.\u201d Sri M\u00e9n\u00e1nti has been generally translated \u201cThe beautiful resting place.\u201d This is far more poetical, but not in accordance with Malay thought, which is always of the most practical, neither can this translation be reconciled with grammar.\n\nThese four men settled at Sri M\u00e9n\u00e1nti and conciliated Origin of the S\u00e1kei of Muar and Joh\u00f3l to a certain extent. It is, however, probable that they found their position somewhat insecure; they, therefore, applied to the Dato\u2019 of Joh\u00f3l for a P\u00ebng-\n\n* \u2018Lemb\u00e1ga,\u2019 condition, quality, system, and so applied to \u2018manager\u2019 of latter.\n\u2020 i.e., \u2018engk\u00e1ya,\u2019 for \u2018\u00f3rang k\u00e1ya,\u2019 lit: \u2018rich man,\u2019 but merely a title actually.\n\u2021 It is not the name, but an epithet from the colour and flourishing condition of the padi, it is not confined to it in the ripe stage, but is used of it when green also.\n\nD. F. A. H.\nIt is not clear whether the Dato' of Joh\u00f3l had then been converted to Islam; in any case, he sent a S\u00e1kei B\u00e1tin as P\u00ebngh\u00falu. Some time after this, a family of M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau settlers of the tribe of Sri L\u00ebmak came from Pah\u00e1ng, hearing that their own countrymen had arrived in Ulu Muar. This family consisted of a man, his wife, two daughters and one son. The son married the daughter of the S\u00e1kei P\u00ebngh\u00falu, sent from Joh\u00f3l, and his wife bore him a son. The P\u00ebngh\u00falu died when this child was about six years old, and the son was elected as P\u00ebngh\u00falu, but, being a minor, his father administered for him until he came of age, and hence the title of Pangku\u2020 P\u00ebngh\u00falu (Deputy P\u00ebngh\u00falu) from the four original settlers and their families. It is thus that in all these States the M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau settlers observed the S\u00e1kei, or, as they are termed, Waris\u2021 rights, and intermarried with S\u00e1kei, the women on their marriage adopting the religion of their husbands. In writing this sketch, my principal object is to make the constitution as clear as possible, and I will not enter into any elaborate stories or theories which created slight shades of difference in the individual States on questions of origin, as the constitution is but slightly affected by these.\n\nBefore proceeding further, I would lay special stress on the supremacy of the female P\u00ebngh\u00falu of Joh\u00f3l over the States of Sri M\u00e9nanti, including Muar, J\u00ebmpol \u00a7 and G\u00e9m\u00e9ncheh. The Dato' of Joh\u00f3l to the present day wears his hair long, and the P\u00ebngh\u00falu of these States must go to him if necessary, as he is not expected to travel, the first Joh\u00f3l P\u00ebngh\u00faluship having been held by a female, and the same rules as applied to her then, apply to this day.\n\n* 'P\u00ebng' a personal prefix and 'H\u00falu' head, this officer was the head, while the 'P\u00ebngl\u00edma' was the hand, 'lima' was the hand, and so came from the number of the fingers to stand for five.\n\u2020 Bosom, lap, and to hold in the same so to support, in this case, temporarily.\n\u2021 'Warith' (Ar.) corrupted into 'waris,' heirs.\n\u00a7 Name of a fish, which is handed on to the river and so to the State.\n\nD. F. A. H.\nAnother point that must be borne in mind is the succession by the female not only to property but also to title and State revenues. The S\u00e1kei or Waris adopted the tribal system introduced by the M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau settlers, and are now termed B\u00e9du\u00e1nda* as a tribe. They cannot intermarry. Thus the women of the Waris tribe must marry into the M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau tribes, but the children of the marriage are Waris. A B\u00e9du\u00e1nda man again must marry into one of the M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau tribes, the offspring in this case being of the tribe of the woman, and having no Waris rights.\n\nI have already mentioned the first settlers in Sri M\u00e9n\u00e1nti and I infer that they had considerable difficulty in conciliating the S\u00e1kei. The same, I think, applied in R\u00e9mbau. Both in the Sri M\u00e9n\u00e1nti States, now subdivided into Ulu Muar, J\u00e9mpol, T\u00e9r\u00e1chi, and G\u00fanong P\u00e1sir, and also in the State of R\u00e9mbau, land was purchased by the L\u00e9mb\u00e1ga or Chief of tribe, for his people, from the S\u00e1kei. The purchase was a piece of cloth, a knife or a weapon, a cooking-pot. In the other States the S\u00e1kei placed no obstacles in the way of the M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau settlers, and lands were cultivated by the tribes without purchase from the S\u00e1kei, though only with their consent. Thus throughout the N\u00e9gri Sembilan, with the exception of R\u00e9mbau and the Sri M\u00e9n\u00e1nti States, the lands are still State lands and virtually the property of the Waris. The tribes are most tenacious of their freehold rights \"t\u00e1nah b\u00e9rt\u00e9bus.\" The old saying in these two States is \"t\u00e1kek (t\u00e1kok\u2020) k\u00e1yu B\u00e1ti\u0144\u2021 J\u00e9nang.\u00a7 p\u00fatus t\u00e9bus kap\u00e1da Undang.\" That is, the blazing of the trees (defining of the boundaries) is performed by the B\u00e1ti\u0144 j\u00e9nang,|| the purchase is decided by the Undang.\n\n* Cf.

'vidwas' skilled.)\n\u2020 'T\u00e1kok' is deeper than 't\u00e1kek.'\n\u2021 Chief.\n\u00a7 Deputy, probably originally derived from 'J\u00e9nang' a post, brace, support.\n|| The B\u00e1ti\u0144 and his J\u00e9nang (Deputy).\n\nD. F. A. H.\nIn all these States, however, the Dato' of Joh\u00f3l, acting in concert with the other three Dato's, i.e., the Undangyangampat, made certain State reserves in order to provide for purposes of State and resting places for themselves when travelling from State to State. These lands are called t\u00e1nah t\u00e9l\u00e1pakkan,* and will be dealt with again later.\n\nThe term used in describing the S\u00e1kei or Waris rights is \"G\u00e1ung, Guntong, Bukit, B\u00fakau, Herta Waris, i.e., ravines and hill-locked basins, hill and surrounding flats are the property of the Waris. This is equivalent to all State lands. Although the tribes are so tenacious of their rights to land acquired by purchase, yet it is impossible to infer much from it, if taken from its origin. The purchase has developed on account of the rapacity of the various powerful Waris families. The evil, however, has great advantages in administration, consequent on the great facility in dealing with all land matters with the Chiefs of tribes, who are most jealous of interference by others and who are anxious to thoroughly secure their rights.\n\nI have tried to keep the origin and the constitution of these States separate, but although I have diverged slightly and dealt with matters of constitution, it was necessary to do so when origin and constitution were so closely allied. These States prospered exceedingly, and the first arrivals were joined by many others, who, no doubt, heard of the success of their fellow-countrymen.\n\nAll these settlers came from the inland districts of M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau. In M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau there are two \"\u00e1dat,\" or customs, viz., the \u00e1dat t\u00e9m\u00e9nggung\u2020 and\n\n* 'T\u00e9l\u00e1pak,' the sole of the foot, a variant of 't\u00e1pak; so 'tel\u00e1pakk\u00e1n,' place under the sole of the foot, resting-place.\n\u2020 Or 'kat\u00e9m\u00e9ng\u00fangan', by some thought to be a person like P\u00e9rp\u00e1tih P\u00ednang S\u00e1batang. [See Undang-undang Moco-Moco (M\u00faka-M\u00faka West coast of\nthe \u00e1dat p\u0115rp\u00e1teh.* The \u00e1dat t\u0115m\u0115nggung prevails on the sea coast, and is the same as in all other Malay countries. The \u00e1dat p\u0115rp\u00e1teh, inland and very different. The \u00e1dat p\u0115rp\u00e1teh prevails in these States; in Sungei Ujong the \u00e1dat p\u0115rp\u00e1teh and the \u00e1dat t\u0115m\u0115nggung are mixed.\n\nIt is to be inferred that, after a time, it was found that the constitution of these States could not be thoroughly secured, unless a Raja was placed over them to settle differences between States, and questions which the P\u0115ngh\u00fblu were not competent to settle in each State. It was, therefore, decided that six men should be selected to travel to Joh\u00f3r and to M\u0115nangk\u00e1bau, and apply for a Raja of the M\u0115nangk\u00e1bau royal family. It would appear that Joh\u00f3r and M\u0115nangk\u00e1bau were at that time closely allied, Joh\u00f3r being the greatest power to the east of the Straits of Malacca, and M\u0115nangk\u00e1bau the greatest in Sumatra and on the west. These six Officers bore the titles of (1) J\u00f3han, (2) And\u00e1tar, (3) Laksam\u00e1na, (4) Laksam\u00e1na, (5) P\u0115ngl\u00edma S\u00fatan, (6) P\u0115ngl\u00edma Raja. They travelled to Joh\u00f3r and thence to M\u0115nangk\u00e1bau and arrived at the Ist\u00e1na. They appear to have been ignorant men, and instead of taking the necessary precautions and going through the proper forms, they were imposed upon by an Officer of the Court who represented himself as a Raja and whose followers, no doubt, supported in the deception. This man\u2019s name was Si KHATIB, and he called himself Raja KABIB. The six Officers then returned to the N\u0115gri S\u0115mbilan with KHATIB as Raja, but before he was proclaimed, a letter arrived from M\u0115nangk\u00e1bau giving the real facts of the case. It was then arranged that the six Officers should go back to M\u0115nangk\u00e1bau and be more careful. This they did, and the Rajas of M\u0115nangk\u00e1bau selected Raja\n\n* Sansk. \u2018p\u00e1ti\u2019 lord.

H\nMEL\u00c9WAR to return to the N\u00e9gri Sembilan and be proclaimed Sultan of those States. The Rajas of M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau gave Raja MEL\u00c9WAR a following of 40 persons to take him to Siak; from Siak the Raja of Siak sent 40 persons to convey him to Malacca; in Malacca 40 persons conveyed him to Naning; and then again 40 persons conveyed him to R\u00ebmbau. It would appear that the installation took place at P\u00e9n\u00e1jis in R\u00ebmbau, and after the t\u00e1bal, the Yam Tuan proceeded to the Istana at Sri M\u00e9nanti, in the State of \u00dalu Muar.\n\nThe terms given to the States of Joh\u00f3l, Sungei \u00dajong, R\u00ebmbau, and \u00dalu Muar in connection with the election of the Yam Tuan are:\u2014R\u00ebmbau, T\u00e1nah Kar\u00e1jaan* (P\u00e9n\u00e1jis\u2020); Sungei Ujong, B\u00e1lei M\u00e9lintang;* Joh\u00f3l, B\u00e1lei B\u00e9rtengkat;* and \u00dalu Muar, T\u00e1nah M\u00ebng\u00e1ndong.* Thus the first Sultan of N\u00e9gri Sembilan was Yam T\u00faan B\u00e9s\u00e1r Raja MEL\u00c9WAR.\n\nThe Yam Tuan M\u00fadaship of R\u00ebmbau was of later creation, and so was the Yam-Tuan-M\u00fadaship of J\u00ebl\u00ebbu. In R\u00ebmbau the tribe of Sakei or Waris had been added to by another tribe called B\u00ebdu\u00e1nda J\u00e1wa. R\u00ebmbau origin has been thoroughly explained by Mr. DUDLEY HERVEY in his valuable pamphlet on that State. In J\u00ebl\u00ebbu, the Dato' of J\u00ebl\u00ebbu had originally Raja powers vested in him; he later applied to the Yam Tuan of Sri M\u00e9nanti for a separate Yam Tuan, and this was granted. J\u00ebl\u00ebbu is a considerable distance from the Istana of Sri M\u00e9nanti, and this, together with the probability that he was unable to hold his own with the Chiefs, was the cause. The Yam Tuan of Sri M\u00e9nanti retained suzerain rights as in\n\n---\n\n* For an explanation of these names see Journal S.B., R.A.S., No. 13, for June 1884, paragraph 246.\n\u2020 Or 'P\u00e9n\u00e1jih,' the R\u00ebmbau river as far as its junction with the 'P\u00ebnar' at 'Sempang,' from which point it is called the 'Lingga,' but in a map in GODINKO DE GREDIA's Account of Malacca (A.D. 1613) the Linggi at the mouth is called 'Rio Panagim,' which confirm the tradition that the name 'Lingga' (a certain part of a boat or prahu) is of comparatively recent origin.\n\nD. F. A. H.\nRembau. In Rembau, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti had the strongest voice in the election and succession of the Yam Tuan Muda together with the Dato' of Rembau, and the Dato' of Rembau had to go to the Istana at Sri Menanti. In Jel\u0435\u0431u, the Dato' of Jel\u0435\u0431u had to go to the Istana, and the Yam Tuan settled the succession. If there was any difficulty with the Yam Tuan, the Dato' of Jel\u0435\u0431u consulted with the Dato' of Johol.\n\nThe ceding of Klang to the Yam Tuanship of Selangor was arranged in a friendly way. The To Engku of Klang complained of the great distance to the Istana of Sri Menanti, and it would appear that Klang at the time was but thinly populated by Mahomedan settlers. It was, therefore, decided that Klang should acknowledge the Yam Tuan of Selangor as Raja\u2014Segamat and Pasi Besar became separated from the Negri Sembilan on account of disturbances, and were brought under Muar administration. Jelei in Pahang would not appear to have ever mixed with the nine States. It is only on account of the fact that one of the nine Batin took up that river as his district that Jelei has been numbered as one of the nine States. The origin of the Waris of the tribes and of the Rajas is, I trust, fairly clear. Several points in constitution combined with origin have also been dealt with, which will be of use towards understanding the constitution, and with which I will now deal.\n\nConstitution. The main law is the following:\n\n1. Orang Semenda* kapada Tempat Semenda.\n2. Anak Buah kapada Ibubapa.\n3. Ibubapa kapada Lembaga.\n4. Lembaga kapada Undang.\n5. Undang kapada Ka'adilan.\n\n* This expression is now used generally amongst the Menangkabau folk, but perhaps it bears a reference to the custom of cousins marrying; 'Sa-manda,' 'satu manda,' 'manda' = 'emak,' one mother, she from whom the parents of both took their origin.\n\nD. F. A. H.\n1. The married man shall look to his wife's male relations for assistance in any questions regarding his wife or her property.\n\n2. The people of the tribe shall look to the heads of families (elders) in each tribe for assistance in all difficulties.\n\n3. The heads of families (elders) shall look to the Lembaga.\n\n4. The Lembaga shall look to the Undang (Penghulu).\n\n5. The Undang shall look to the Ka'adilan (the Sultan).\n\nI will take these sayings one by one. As property all goes in the female line, it is necessary that the female shall have every protection. Her husband cannot mortgage or sell her property. He cannot touch it. If he brings money or property into his wife's house, it is necessary for him to call the Tempat Sembenda,* that is, the male relations of his wife together, and declare the property that he brings, in order that, in cases of death or divorce, there may be no question with regard to such property. This is generally done with a feast a goat slaughtered, or in some cases a buffalo. If the husband does not declare property (wang atau herta membawa),\u2020 he cannot claim in case of contingencies, such as divorce or death, settlement on his children, &c., and such property lapses to the woman, his widow. The debt of a man cannot be claimed against the property of his wife, unless there is personal property as described, but can be claimed against his herta pesaka,\u2021 that is, the property of his mother, or, if dead, of her heirs. In all cases of debts, or in fines inflicted on a man and unpaid, and failing personal property, the herta pesaka can be seized not the herta semenda. It is the duty of the Ibu Bapa and the Lembaga to give every assistance in this matter. Execution was very rare in these States; in all criminal cases, from murder downwards, fines\n\n* Lit. place where he married.\n\u2020 Money or property brought.\n\u2021 Inherited property. (Sansk.

H.\nbeing inflicted, hence the term \"s\u00e1lah di timbang, utang dibay\u00e9r,\"* i.e., the value of the fault is weighed, and when weighed the debt is paid. The property of a woman descends to the female children of the marriage. In the event of there being more than one female child, the house and kampong\u2020 is the property of the eldest, and the s\u00e1wah\u2021 is divided equally. If the man has acquired landed property before marriage, it cannot leave his tribe, it must go to his \"anak b\u00faa\u1e25\" \u00a7 in the tribe. Hence the term \"herta p\u00e9s\u00e1ka kap\u00e1da anak b\u00faa\u1e25.\" If the husband has personal property, he can leave it to whom he likes, unless the property is acquired during his marriage, when such property is shared equally between man and wife, even kampong and s\u00e1wah.\n\nThe tribes are divided into one, two, three and sometimes as many as six families, and it is from these Anak b\u00faa\u1e25 families that the Lemb\u00e1ga is elected. Hence kap\u00e1da Ibu the term with regard to the Chiefs of tribes B\u00e1pa. \"p\u00e9s\u00e1ka b\u00ebrg\u00e9ler.\"|| The order of succession by each family to the Lemb\u00e1gaship is fixed, and the election, therefore, is made in the family next in succession. The Ibu B\u00e1pa, or representatives of these families, have to carry out the instructions of the Lemb\u00e1ga and assist in all matters in the tribe; such as the collection of the \"m\u00e1s m\u00e1nah,\"\u00b6 which is a tribute to the Raja, viz., \"bras sa'g\u00e1ntang nior sa't\u00e1li,\"** i.e., one gantang of rice and two coco-nuts. This will be explained later. The Ibu B\u00e1pa is again responsible to the Lemb\u00e1ga for all faults committed or debts incurred in his section of the tribe, \"kat\u00farunan-nya,\" \u2020\u2020 i.e., the descendants according\n\n---\n\n* Fault is weighed and debt is paid.\n\u2020 i.e., rising ground surrounding the house usually fenced in, as the name implies.

H.\nto the female line from the original family or families of the tribe. In some cases these descendants number 50 families, about 200 souls. The people of each Kat\u00farunan appeal to the \u00cdbu B\u00e1pa; thus in questions of the property or other matters which the Orang S\u00e9m\u00ebnda and T\u011bmpat S\u00e9m\u00ebnda cannot settle between them, the \u00cdbu B\u00e1pa would be the appeal. If again the latter cannot settle the case, he would bring the matter before the L\u00ebmb\u00e1ga. \u00cdbu B\u00e1pa is a curious name, meaning literally father and mother (elder).*\n\nThe L\u00ebmb\u00e1ga\u2019s powers are various. In the first place he has the power to fine \u201cdua p\u00faloh s\u00e9r\u00ebpi,\u201d\u2020 which amounts to $7.20 of the present currency. He is the one who is present at all purchases and sales of land, by his tribe or to his tribe. He is the one who deals with the Waris in purchasing waste lands for his tribe. The purchase of waste lands from the Waris has been touched upon already.

He it is who enquires into the personal property of the individual, if there is none, he falls back upon the herta p\u0113s\u0101ka, which he sells or mortgages in order to cover the debt. He also settles debt cases. Mortgage of property tribe with tribe must be declared before both Lembaga. If in the same tribe, it is said not to be necessary. All sales must be carried out by the Lembaga, and if sold into another tribe the boundary posts are again fixed by both Lembaga \"lantak b\u0113rt\u016bkul.\" The election of the \u00cdbu B\u00e1pa is in the hands of the people of each descent in the tribe; that of the Lembaga by the \u00cdbu B\u00e1pa. The \u00cdbu B\u00e1pa are in some tribes as many as seven, in some as few as one; if more than one, each family takes it in turn for the Lembagaship, and it only remains to select the man, which rule, if strictly adhered to, makes the election very easy. The Lembaga and Waris \"orang yang dua-blas* s\u0113rta waris\" elect the Undang.\n\nI now come to the Lembaga kap\u0101da Undang. The number of Waris descents in each State from which the Dato' Penghulu or Undang can be elected varies. In Muar there are three, viz., the To' Muar, the P\u0113rd\u0101na, and the P\u0113rba\u2020 descents. The present Undang is of the first, and will be succeeded by the P\u0113rd\u0101na descents; then the P\u0113rba descent; and then again the Penghuluship will revert to To' Muar. In Rembau, there are two descents, viz., the B\u0113duanda J\u0101kun\u2021 or Waris S\u0113dia\u00a7 Raja, and the B\u0113duanda J\u0101wa or Waris L\u0113la Maharaja, and they take it turn and turn about for the Penghuluship. In Joh\u00f3l, there is only one descent from which the Undang can be elected, and the B\u00e1tin of Joh\u00f3l have a stronger voice in the election than the Lembaga. The other States are minor questions. In T\u00e9rachi, it is a curious fact that the Undang is not elected from the Waris, but from the\n\n* i.e., of the 12 's\u016bk\u016b.'\n\u2020 Sansk. 'Parva' ancient.\n\u2021 Cf. Ceylon 'Yakko'.\n\u00a7 Sansk. 'S\u0101dya' ancient.\n\nD. F. A. H.\ntribe of Sri L\u00ebmak,* Pah\u00e1ng. The Undang, however, must marry into the tribe of the Waris. Thus, in Muar, the three descents are the three K\u00ebp\u00e1la Waris. In T\u00ebr\u00e1chi, there are two, in J\u00ebmpol there is one, in G\u00fanong P\u00e1sir there is one, in Joh\u00f3l and \u00cdnas there is one, with a male and female representative. In R\u00ebmbau, the Waris are somewhat different. Besides the Undang, there are five K\u00ebp\u00e1la Waris, viz., P\u00ebrba (who is also the L\u00ebmb\u00e1ga over both families of B\u00ebdu\u00e1nda), Bandar,\u2020 Mangku B\u00fami,\u2021 M\u00ebntri L\u00e9la P\u00ebrk\u00e1sa, and Raja di Raja. There have been several somewhat complicated questions in R\u00ebmbau, probably consequent on the unequal number of the K\u00ebp\u00e1la Waris. Formerly, according to the constitution, if the Undang was of the descent of S\u00ebdia Raja, the Bandar must be taken from the descent of L\u00e9la Maharaja. It was found, however, that if the rule was strictly enforced, it was possible that the Bandar would cease to exist, which did actually occur. A reform, therefore, was made in the constitution and this condition was repealed. Where the constitution is strictly enforced, all elections are comparatively easy, but the slightest departure from the constitution throws the whole procedure into a hopeless state of chaos.\n\nThe Undang has in each State the power to fine \"Satu Bahra\" which is equal to $14 of the present currency. The Undang (Dato' P\u00ebnh\u00falu) is virtually he who, as a commoner, has the interests of the Waris and L\u00ebmb\u00e1ga and the people of their tribes at heart and is the upholder of their rights and of the constitution. The appeal from the L\u00ebmb\u00e1ga's decision is to the Undang, and all cases in which the jurisdiction of the L\u00ebmb\u00e1ga is insufficient, must be brought to the P\u00ebnh\u00falu's court. All waste lands are, as already described, vested in the Waris. The constitution, however, only provided for the purchase of lands for paddy fields and not for more intricate questions, such as lands for Chinese planters and miners, and it is in consequence of this, that so many jealou-\n\n* A local district in M\u00ebnangk\u00e1bau, Sumatra.\n\u2020 Port (Pers.)\n\u2021 Sustainer of the earth (in his lap.)\n\nD. F. A. H.\nsies and difficulties have arisen in these States in reference to participation in revenues.\n\nIt is a mistake to suppose that waste lands are vested in the Dato' P\u0113ngh\u016blu only. They are vested in the Waris, and the participation should be rated throughout the tribe. The rule, however, is \"G\u0113dang sama g\u0113dang, k\u0113chil sama k\u0113chil\"; meaning that the Chiefs get the principal share and the lesser people only a little\u2014literally, big with big small with small.\n\nIn Sungei Ujong, the Dato' Bandar is a very important man. Not so in the other States. The Dato' Bandar in R\u0113mbau has no greater rights to revenues than the other K\u0113p\u0101la Waris. In Muar, the Dato' Bandar is really a mere title, and he does not participate with the K\u0113p\u0101la Waris in waste lands, nor does he in J\u0113mpol or G\u0113m\u00e9ncheh. The Undang should participate as such in general revenues on account of the office to which he has been elected, viz., the highest office held by a commoner in each State. As a Waris he shares with the other K\u0113p\u0101la Waris. The L\u0113mb\u0101ga participate only to a small extent as heads of tribes, and they can only claim where taxation is introduced which affects their tribes. All cases nearly are settled by custom\u2014\u00e1dat\u2014as already explained. With reference to property, Mahomedan law is only brought in as a last resource, if \u00e1dat is insufficient for the case at issue. Mahomedan law is exercised only by the Ka'\u00e1dilan (Sultan).\n\nIntermarriage in a tribe is looked upon as a very grave offence in R\u0113mbau, and used to be visited by death. In J\u0113mpol, the people are very strict observers of the Mahomedan religion, and they found that this law was so little in accordance with Mahomedan law that the law was repealed, and it only required a slight alteration in the property laws to make this. The Dato' of Joh\u00f3l is the principal Undang, and the States of Ulu Muar, J\u0113mpol, G\u0113m\u00e9ncheh, T\u0113r\u00e1chi and G\u00fanong P\u00e1sir are \"b\u0113rt\u0101li d\u0113ngan Joh\u00f3l,\"* i.e., they are bound to consult Johol on matters of importance. Dato' Baginda Tan \u0100m\u0101s of Johol besides being the K\u0113p\u0101la Waris, is also, so to speak,\n\n* Lit. 'Strung to', 'in one string with.'\n\nD. F. A. H.\nMinister of Foreign Affairs.

The Ka\u2019\u00e1dilan calls the Undang in speaking to him Orang K\u00e1ya. Every Undang has a number of Court Officers, the number of which varies in the different States. The L\u011bmb\u00e1ga is allowed one Officer by the Undang.\n\nUndang kap\u00e1da Ka\u2019\u00e1dilan is the last law to be dealt with. In all cases that the Undang cannot decide, he must refer to the Yam Tuan Ka\u2019\u00e1dilan. The Yam Tuan has the power to fine \u201canam p\u016floh anam K\u016bpang,\u201d amounting to $24.80 of the present currency. In cases foreign to the constitution, he is, as the title of Ka\u2019\u00e1dilan implies, all powerful to administer justice. The Ka\u2019\u00e1dilan alone can try cases in which Rajas are concerned, even though married to commoners. The term is \u201cm\u00ednjak ka\u2019minjak j\u00faa \u00e1y\u011br ka \u00e1y\u011br\u201d\u2014oil to oil, water to water.

If there was no Raja in the country fit to succeed the deceased, it might be necessary to go to the Yam Tuan of M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau, or to the Yam Tuan of Joh\u00f3r in the old days. The P\u00e9g\u00e1wei yang s\u00e8mbilan p\u00faloh s\u00e8mbilan (99) have to obey the orders given by the P\u00e9g\u00e1wei yang anam, and cannot fail to come to the Ist\u00e1na on all State occasions. They are so to speak the Police of the Ist\u00e1na.\n\nThe B\u011bnt\u00e1ra* K\u00e1nan and B\u011bnt\u00e1ra Kiri both of the tribe of B\u011bdu\u00e1nda, stand one on each side of the dais at the election of the Yam Tuan. The B\u011bnt\u00e1ra K\u00e1nan calls the Undang to s\u00e8mbah. The order is \"t\u00edtah panggil daulat\" and the title of the Undang is given, thus in the case of the Dato' of Joh\u00f3l \"Oh Dato' Joh\u00f3l J\u00f3han Pahl\u00e1wan L\u00e9la P\u011brk\u00e1sa S\u011bti\u00e1- \"want yang m\u011bmrentah did\u00e1lam n\u0113gri Joh\u00f3l t\u00edtah panggil \"daulat.\" The Undang then answers daulat and comes forward to do homage.\n\nIn dealing with the election of the Yam Tuan B\u011bs\u00e1r of Sri M\u011bn\u00e1nti, it is now only necessary that the Dato's of Joh\u00f3l, Muar, J\u011bmpol, T\u011br\u00e1chi and G\u00fanong P\u00e1sir should be d'accord. The Dato' of \u00cdnas is a branch of the Joh\u00f3l Waris of the oldest descent, but the State is so small that it has never been taken into account. If, strictly in accordance with the constitution, the Dato' of Joh\u00f3l or Dato' Baginda Tan \u0100m\u00e1s as his proxy proceeds to one of the State reserves \"T\u00e1nah T\u011bl\u0101pakkan\" in Ulu Muar.\n\nAs soon as the new Yam Tuan is agreed upon, the Dato of Muar, who is S\u011bti\u00e1 Maharaja L\u00e9la Pahl\u00e1wan, sends for P\u011bnglima S\u00fatan and P\u011bnglima Raja, who then make arrangements for the T\u00e1bal or installation of the Yam Tuan. With regard to other forms and ceremonies for the installation of the Yam Tuan and the forms observed in the Ist\u00e1na and by the people to the Yam Tuan, they are similar to those\n\n* Modern form of 'Abantara,' sword-bearer.\n\u2020 'L\u00e9la' fencing; Skr. 'Praka\u00e7a' mighty valiant; Skr. 'satya' faith, loyalty.\n\nD. F. A. H.\nin P\u00e9rah and S\u00e9l\u00e1ngor. The Yam Tuan B\u011bs\u00e1r of Sri M\u011bn\u00e1nti has 32 guns fired on State occasions. The Yam Tuan M\u00fada (J\u011bl\u011bbu and R\u011bmbau) 16 guns. The eldest son of the Yam Tuan B\u011bs\u00e1r is T\u011bngku B\u011bs\u00e1r. The eldest son of the Yam Tuan M\u00fada is T\u011bngku M\u00fada. On the death of a Yam Tuan, the old custom is, that all the people in the country shall pay \"m\u00e1s m\u00e1nah.\" This consists of one gantang of rice, two coco-nuts, one fowl, and duit s'p\u00e9rah which amounts to six cents of the present currency. In populous countries like these this amounts to a great deal. I have already mentioned the T\u00e1nah T\u011bl\u00e1pakkan or State reserves, T\u011bl\u00e1pakkan Undang yang ampat. If the To \u011angku of Klang, the Dato' of J\u011bl\u011bbu, the Klana of Sungei Ujong, or the Dato' of Joh\u00f3l travelled, they always stayed at one of these reserves, and the people occupying the reserves had to pay a tribute of one gantang of rice, two coco-nuts, one fowl, chillies and saffron, for their sustenance.\n\nThe \u00cdbu B\u00e1pa of tribes collect the m\u00e1s m\u00e1nah for the Raja. They then take it to the L\u011bmb\u00e1ga, who takes it to the Undang. The Undang then takes it to the Ist\u00e1na on the day appointed by the officers of the Yam Tuan's court. It is necessary that every Undang should go to the Ist\u00e1na on every H\u00e1ri R\u00e1ya, or if not H\u00e1ri R\u00e1ya on R\u00e1ya Haji, to do homage to the Yam Tuan. This is the same in P\u00e9rah and S\u00e9l\u00e1ngor. The people of these countries are exceedingly tenacious of their individual rights, viz., the rights of the T\u011bmpat S\u011bm\u011bnda, the rights of the \u00cdbu B\u00e1pa, of the L\u011bmb\u00e1ga of the Undang, of the Waris and of the Raja; and if their laws are adhered to and strictly supported, it is very easy to administer a large Malay population.\n\nMARTIN

The other two\u2014\"Sri Rama\" and \"Raja Donan\"\u2014have been printed in the two preceding numbers of this Journal.]\n\nRAJA AMBONG and Princess Bongsu Chandra Rupa were brother and sister and lived together at Tanjong Bima, over which country the former reigned. They had been left orphans at an early age, and had been brought up by the Chiefs of the State, who had put Raja Ambong on the throne, there being no other heir of the royal stock. When Raja Ambong had reigned for seven years and nine months, he had a dream one night, and in his dream he travelled into the interior of the country of Bima until he arrived at a plain ever so many yojanas in extent. Advancing to the centre of it, he saw there a large ant-hill (busut betina) and on it another ant-hill (busut jantan) on which stood on one leg (tiang tunggal) an old man dressed in yellow, who held in his hand a Malacca cane (samambu bunting) ornamented with gold and having a diamond on the top of it. As he drew near to the old man, the latter addressed him saying:\u2014\u201cRaja Ambong, what is the good of going on like this? What are you learning here under the Chiefs and under the care of the women of the palace?\u201d and a great deal more to the same effect. Raja Ambong said in reply that he had no means of travelling about the world to gather experience, for he had no ship. The old man then told him to go to a certain place where a magic merbau tree was growing, and instructed him to cut it down and make of it a ship, which he was to call \u201cBatara Saludang Mayang.\u201d Raja Ambong mentioned the want of workmen, when the old man at once told him to give\ndirections to the Chiefs to fetch down seven ship-builders, all brothers, who lived up the country. \"If,\" added the old man, \"the seven ship-builders cannot do the work, you must direct the Tumonggong to fetch your Cousin Che Alang, a native of Linggi, who lives at the mouth of the River Limau Purut. He is your cousin on your mother's side, and you can require him to fetch the workman called Tukang Bongkok Bongsu Bangawan.\n\nPandak kaki deri tangan\nTukang ter-pechat di negri Jawa\nBukan pechat sebab ta'tukang,\nTukang terlampau deripada tukang yang baniak,\nItu-lah sebab di-buang Raja ka-saberang laut tawar,\nIya-lah yang bulik ber-bahan kayu merbau itu.\n\n(\"whose legs are shorter than his arms; banished formerly from the kingdom of Java, not because he was wanting in skill, but because he exceeded all other craftsmen in his handiwork. This was why the Raja banished him to the other side of the lake. He it is who can fell the merbau tree.\")\n\nAt the end of this speech, Raja Ambong awoke with a start, and, remembering distinctly all that had passed in his dream, went out into the balei and sounded the alarm gong, which soon brought the Chiefs and people to him. He then related his dream, and his audience bowed their heads till they touched the floor, so great was their satisfaction at the recital. The Tumonggong was then directed to summon the seven brother shipbuilders, and to direct them to build a prahu to be called Batara Saludang Mayang, and in course of time they duly arrived. On being brought before the Raja, they said that the omens which they had consulted before leaving home were unpropitious, and they asked for leave to return once more and make a fresh start. This the Raja would not hear of, and the seven brothers set out, prophesying that harm would happen to them; they travelled inland till they found the merbau tree, and they built themselves a little hut near it. Evening closed in:\n\nMaka hari-pun sudah-lah merimbang petang,\nBota pun ber-suara mengakak di-panggil-nia.\nHujan panas pun turun memenchar-menchar\nPalangi pun turun minum di pangkal dahan tua-nia,\nDan di puchuk-nia langsuyar mengarak mengilai.\n\nall kinds of evil beings sat in the branches of the merbau tree, and made unearthly noises, but as night advanced they grew quieter, and in the morning the seven carpenters got up and proceeded to work. A stage was soon erected round the tree, and three men mounted on it to commence chopping, while four remained below to take their places in turn. Then all at once the howling of the evil spirits recommenced, hujan panas descended like water poured out from a bucket, the bota chattered, the jin prayed, the langsuyar shrieked, the palangi came down to drink, and amid a chorus of unearthly noises, the unfortunate carpenters fell dead at their work, three on the staging and four below.\n\nWhen three days and nights had passed, and no sound of axes chopping or tree falling had been heard, the Raja despatched an attendant to see how the work was getting on. The latter discovered the seven corpses covered with flies, and ran back to the palace in alarm. Then the Raja, having given orders for the proper burial of the dead men, ordered the Tumunggong to fetch Che Alang of Linggi, who lived at Kuala Sungai Limau Purut. For seven days did the Tumonggong journey before he reached his destination and delivered his message. Che Alang received him politely and prepared at once to obey the Raja\u2019s commands and to procure the services of the famous Tukang Bongkok Bongsu Bangsawan. Leaving the Tumonggong to return alone by sea, Che Alang of Linggi set out for Raja Ambong\u2019s capital overland, after having been careful to observe the proper omens (langkah) to secure a fortunate journey, he crossed the great lake (laut tawar) after quitting Tanjong Bima, and in due time arrived at the house of the crooked carpenter Bongsu Bangsawan, whose legs were shorter than his arms. In front of the house was the carpenter\u2019s wife, busy winnowing rice. \u201cWhere is Tukang Bongkok (the \u2018crooked carpenter\u2019)?\u201d said Che Along. \u201cHe is asleep in bed,\u201d said the woman, \u201cand he left word that he intended to sleep for seven days and nights, and so far he has\nonly slept for three days and three nights. If you really must speak to him you must get a furnace and heat a bar of iron red-hot and insert it in his ear as he lies asleep. This is the only way to wake him.\" CHE ALANG did as he was told, and uncovering the sleeper's head (he was enveloped in a thick patched quilt, *gebar gandan saratus tampal*) poked the red-hot iron into his ear. The sleeping man rolled over rubbing the place a little, and CHE ALANG thrust the iron into the other ear. Then the crooked carpenter sat up, without opening his eyes (*mata lagi jerikat*) and said \"curse those mosquitoes! A man can't get a quiet sleep (*me-radam*) without being bothered by all kinds of insects.\" Then he went on to storm against his wife for not keeping the insects off while he slept, declaring that he would take a younger wife, and so on. This was too much for CHE ALANG, who burst out laughing, on which the crooked carpenter opened his eyes, and saw a young man, a stranger, before him. CHE ALANG quickly explained the object of his visit, and proposed that they should start together at once for Tanjong Bima. To this, however, the hunchback would not agree, and he sent CHE ALANG on ahead, promising to follow. Then with three terrific yells (*ber-tampik telun temelun ber-turut-turut*) he set out with the speed of the swiftest lightning, a stage at least ahead of the fastest breeze! In an incredibly short space of time he was at Tanjong Bima, and presented himself at the Raja's *balei*, asking what he was wanted for. Raja AMBONG explained that his duty would be to build a boat, to be called *Batara Saludang Mayang*, out of the wood of the *merbau* tree, and was still conversing with the old man when CHE ALANG arrived and was not a little astonished to find the hunchback at the Court before him. Then the crooked carpenter demanded all the instruments of magic\u2014sandal-wood, eagle-wood, and incense, a candle of a cubit's length with a wick of the thickness of a man's thumb, *tepong tawar* (holy water), parched rice, yellow rice, a mat and a carpet, an altar, and eight cubits of white cloth. All these things were provided by the female attendants in the palace by the Raja's orders, and taken out to the *merbau* tree on the enchanted plain, to which place the old man was duly\nescorted. By the evening, he had built himself a little hut, and there he spread his mat and hung up his mosquito-curtain, prepared his holy water, set up his altar, lit his candle, and scattered his rice-grains, and then covering himself up with his white cloth went to sleep. So effectually did these ceremonies scare the evil spirits, that in the morning, when he went out, he saw that of the merbau tree only the heart was left, a straight stem of hard wood not thicker than a man's forearm, all the evil spirits having fled. What on earth the Raja could do with a boat made out of such a log as this he could not make out, but he sat to work to carry out his orders. He fumigated with incense all his tools, and then went to the foot of the tree, using certain charms and ceremonies which were known to him. Then he delivered three strokes\u2014two on one side and one on the other (mendada sa-chatuk, menengku' dua chatuk). At the third the merbau tree creaked (m\u0113rengkoh), and for a day and a night it fell before its branches reached the ground. Laksana bumi g\u0113rak g\u0113mpa dan meranchang kayu di rimba dan ber-g\u0113garan pinggan mangkuk didalam negri Tanjong Bima terkena bahana kayu ranting handak tumbang. (The noise it made was like that of an earthquake, and the trees in the forest shook, and all the plates and dishes in the country clattered with the rush of air caused by the falling mass of branches.) The hunchback cut the stem in two just below the branches (kabong) and then split it open (ch\u016bb belah bujang), and hollowed out one of the halves. It measured twenty-five fathoms in length when on the ground. In seven days the hunchback had made a ship of it, and had equipped her with masts, stays, sails, rigging and anchor; he then went to the town and informed the Raja that the vessel was lying on the stocks (ampayan) ready for sea, but that before she could be moved, seven, or five, or three (an uneven number) of young married women, pregnant for the first time, must be procured to be used as rollers. The Tumonggong, Laksamana and other Chiefs sought far and wide for young women answering the required conditions, but failed to find any except their own daughters. Each of the three principal Chiefs\u2014the Laksamana, Tumonggong, and Orang Kaya Besar\u2014had a recently married daughter, each of them with\nchild for the first time, so the husbands having been seized and bound to prevent disturbance, the unfortunate ladies were taken to the scene of the launch and made to lie down in front of the vessel. Then amid the incantations of the hunchback and the shouts of the populace, the Batara Saludang Mayang glided swiftly down to the sea and shot out into mid-ocean (laut yang lepas ombak yang gahari), where it was lost to view. The ladies got up none the worse for their adventure, and returned home.*\n\nSeven days and seven nights passed without the reappearance of the boat, and then the hunchback, with the permission of the Raja, performed some incantations at the landing-place, at the end of which he waved and beckoned with a yellow cloth, and presently the surface of the sea was disturbed and then the Batara Saludang Mayang came in sight gliding swiftly towards the land like a bird on the wing. When she arrived, the hunchback went on board and performed various precautionary ceremonies, and then the Raja and Che Alang and all the Chiefs went on board and examined her. They found her fully armed and equipped\u2014mariam dua sa-haluan di timba ruang dua sa-sunting pada ekor tahan turut dan rantaka sambilang tujuh snapang pemuras sa-bilang lantei dan bota ber-kubang di haluan, pelangi minum di timba ruang, jin sambahyang diatas kurong, dan langsuyar arak mengilai di puchuk tiang.\n\nOrdering Che Alang to have everything ready for a start on the following day, Raja Ambong went home, but though everything was ready next day, he did not leave, for his sister, Princess Bongsu Chandra Rupa, whom he proposed to leave in charge of the country in his absence, loudly objected to being left behind, and cried and sobbed and demanded to be taken with her brother. Night came and when the Princess had gone to bed and the household was fast asleep (k\u0113r\u0113lap tidor), Raja Ambong unlocked a box in which he kept certain garments possessing magic properties and arms of supernatural origin. These he put on, and then, after due observ-\n\n* Compare the Menangkabau legend told by Newbold, II, 221.\nance of the omens (langkah) he quitted the palace and went down to the vessel with Che Alang of Linggi and Tukang Bongkok Bongsu Bangsawan. Going on board he clapped his hands and sat down (ber-tenggong); he then caused water to be poured over the bows, and cut the rope which made fast to the shore. The Batara Saludang Mayang then glided down into the water, looking like a peacock just spreading its wings for a flight. Raja Ambong addressed his boat in verse and in prose and prayed to the Dewatas demanding a fair wind. Thereupon a breeze sprung up which carried along the prahu with astonishing swiftness. She fled past islands in less time than it takes to draw a breath, the bird on the wing was overtaken and passed, and the fly which attempted to settle on the boat found it slip from under him! The spirits which had haunted the merbau tree still kept their places on board, and the vessel sped on away, never stopping day or night.\n\nThe Princess Chandra Rupa, on the morning after the Raja's flight, was terribly upset at finding that her brother and the Batara Saludang Mayang had disappeared. But she was not to be outdone, and taking a couple of mirrors, her betel-box and her work she got on board an old boat called the Lanchang Kuning, which had formerly belonged to her father. She prayed to the Dewatas and invoked the aid of the boat itself in such moving terms that it started off at once with the speed of a flash of lightning (saperti kilat yang amat tangkis), a good length in front of the fastest breeze (dahulu sa'tapak deripada angin yang d'eras). For two days and nights the Princess sailed by herself, chasing her brother's vessel, and on the morning of the third day, she came in sight of it. Che Alang was steering when he became aware of a craft astern of him, which was advancing at a tremendous pace, and he at once awakened the Raja, who dressed himself carefully and examined the stranger through a telescope. When he recognised the Lanchang Kuning and its occupant, he went back to bed again with fraternal indifference, and left Che Alang to receive the Princess, who soon ran alongside and came on board full of reproaches at having been deserted. She dismissed her boat, which turned round and sped away in the direction of Tanjong Bima. Raja Ambong then came on\ndeck very angry. \"Who summoned you hither?\" said he to the Princess, \"Begone at once, for I have no wish to see your face. Your presence brings shame and disgrace on me in the eyes of respectable people.\" The Princess burst into tears, and devoting herself, in her anger, as a prey to all the sharks of the sea she jumped overboard and disappeared. CHE ALANG dashed in after her, but his search was ineffectual and after a day and a night he returned to Raja AMBONG. Then both of them started together on a fresh search of the unfortunate Princess, the vessel following them as they went from bay to islet and from islet to reef. At last, after a week, they found the body of the unfortunate Princess, quite dead, caught in a cleft between two rocks. CHE ALANG bore it tenderly to the vessel, where her brother spread mats and carpets and laid it out. Then Raja AMBONG burned incense and sandalwood, and taking a metal tray which had been made at the time of the Princess' birth, he passed it through the smoke. Then placing on it a letter and his own turban, he directed the tray to fly through the air to the Princess CHAHYA INTAN, a great friend of the dead Princess, and to ask her to send down from her residence in the skies, one bottle of rose-water.\n\nThe Princess CHAHYA INTAN was sitting at her window, when she saw a tray flying towards her. She at once beckoned it in and found on it a handkerchief, an empty flask and a letter. She quickly read the letter, filled the flask with rose-water and despatched the tray on its return errand. As soon as the first drops fell on the dead Princess, she gave signs of life by the twitching of the great toe, at the second sprinkle she moved her hands, and on being sprinkled the third time, she sat up and sneezed and looked round her.\n\nThe men of the party were quite exhausted by this time, and took some rest, leaving the navigation of the boat to the Princess, who put on male attire and took charge for the next seven days and nights. On the eighth day, she sighted a fleet of a hundred sail, of which one was a very large vessel. She immediately awakened the Raja and CHE ALANG, and the latter, not being satisfied with the aspect of things, went to call the crooked carpenter, who was asleep in the forecastle. He\npulled the big toe of each foot in turn, and the old man got up muttering. After a good look at the fleet, he announced that the large vessel was owned by the son of a King of the Jins\u2014\u201cPayar di laut\u201d\u2014that her anchor was caught in the roof of the palace of the Raja NAGA (King of the Dragons) at the bottom of the sea, and that the Prince and his sister, the Princess RENEK JINTAN, had already been detained there by this accident for twelve years. \u201cIn the days of your Highness\u2019 father,\u201d added the old man, \u201cwhen I was still young, if we came across anything of this sort, blood was sure to be spilt.\u201d* Then he wrapped himself upon his patched quilt and went to sleep again. The Raja and CHE ALANG, too, lay down, and the Princess, who had heard the carpenter\u2019s story, felt her courage rise with excitement, and she ground her teeth (mengertip-ngertip gigi-nia) while the blood rose to her cheeks.\n\nThe son of the King of the Jins was called SI DEWA MAMBANG. He was sitting on the deck of his vessel when he caught sight of the Batara Saludang Mayang, and presently, through his telescope, made out that the occupants were three men lying asleep and a Princess of surpassing loveliness. He at once despatched his Tumonggong with presents to demand the lady in marriage, and the Princess received him politely and entertained him with betel-nut. But in reply to his proposals, she declared that on board the Batara Saludang Mayang they were all men and that they had no woman among them. The Tumonggong went away in some confusion and carried this answer to his Lord. The latter again made a searching inspection through his glass and vowed that the fourth person on board the Batara Saludang Mayang could be no other than a Princess, and again he despatched the Tumonggong with his message. This time the Princess admitted her sex, but she vowed that she was already betrothed (sudah menjadi tunang lanang orang), and that her promised husband was even then on board the vessel with her\n\n* Lit. tuntu di-dalam ayer sirih patek apa, \u201cwe should certainly all be in betel juice.\u201d\nThis message, carried back to Si Dewa Mambang by the Tumonggong, put the former in a furious rage, and he ordered his men to be assembled, guns to be run out, and an attack to be made on the Batara Saludang Mayang.\n\nThe usual sea-fight followed when, of course, the whole fleet of Si Dewa Mambang was sunk. Then came a single combat on board the vessel of the Demon Chief in which, equally of course, Raja Ambong was triumphant and cut off the head of his adversary. The Princess Renek Jintan, daughter of the slain Chief, was on board, and Raja Ambong demanded her in marriage. But she dutifully insisted on having her father restored to life before she would accept the hand of the victor, and this was accordingly done. Then the marriage duly took place.\n\nIt has been related how Si Dewa Mambang's vessel had been in the same spot for twelve years, her anchor having caught in the roof of the house of the King of the Dragons. Raja Ambong now undertook to settle this difficulty, and fastening an iron chain round his waist he proceeded to climb down the cable under water until he reached the bottom of the sea. Reaching the palace of the King of the Dragons, he speedily made himself so much at home that he forgot about all those on the surface of the ocean above, and took as his wife the Princess Chahya Intan, the daughter of the Dragon King. After he had been married for three months his thoughts turned one day on his ship the Batara Saludang Mayang and his wife, Princess Renek Jintan, whom he had left in the other vessel up above. So he presented himself before his father-in-law the King of the Dragons, and asked for permission to revisit the earth and also to release the anchor which had got hooked in the palace roof. No sooner was his wish expressed than the order was given, and after taking leave of his second wife he climbed up the cable and rejoined his companions on board Si Dewa Mambang's ship. The anchor was now hove up, but Raja Ambong preferred his own vessel, and with the permission of his father-in-law removed, with his wife, Princess Renek Jintan, and his companions, on board the Batara Saludang Mayang. Then they sailed away, visiting all sorts of strange countries,\namong which were the seven following,:\u2014Champa,(1) Chala,(2) Tanjong Jambu Lipa,(3) Teluk Jambu Ayer, Dong Sip, Tanjong Chamara Bunga, and Pulau Mayang Manggi. It was not until he reached the last named place that Raja AMBONG saw a kingdom which really attracted him. Pulau Mayang Manggi was a great country, ruled by one Raja AMBONG AWAN UNGU, to whom news was quickly brought of the arrival of the strangers. He despatched the Laksamana to obtain particulars, and, on the return of the latter with a description of the newly arrived vessel and her freight, Raja AMBONG was invited on shore and was received on landing with great state and honour. His love adventures had not come to an end, though he had already two wives, for as he was on his way up to the palace the Princess MAYANG MANGGI, sister of Raja AMBONG AWAN UNGU, saw him and straightway fell in love with him. To drop into his hands as he passed beneath her lattice a little ivory casket containing three pastilles of betel-nut was the affair of a moment. Raja AMBONG opened the packet, and improvised the following stanza:\u2014\n\nMasok geronggong ber-palita  \nAnak tekukur di tebing tinggi  \nBesar-nia untong kapada kita  \nSirih ber-kapur datang sendiri.*\n\nTo which the Princess over-head replied:\u2014\n\nBeringin tumboh di sekam  \nKaparat lalu ka ma\u2019arifat-nia  \nJikalau ingin sirih di-genggam  \nChoba-lah turut pada tampat-nia.\u2020\n\n(1) Champa. A Malay Kingdom in the south west corner of Cochin-China. See Yule\u2019s Glossary, tit. Champa; Crawfurd\u2019s Malay Grammar, Dissertation, CXXIX.\n\n(2) Chala=Chola?\n\n(3) Jambu Dwipa, one of the seven divisions of the earth in Hindu Mythology.\n\n* One enters a cave with the aid of a lamp: a young pigeon on a high bank: great indeed is my good fortune: betelnut comes of its own accord.\n\n\u2020 The beringin tree springs from a heap of chaff: from infidelity one passes to perfect knowledge: if you have a desire to possess this sirih, try and reach the place whence it came.\nRaja AMBONG responded with another verse:\n\n*Kaparat lalu ka ma'arifat-nia  \nPatah tunjang si-mali-mali  \nKu-turut lalu pada tampat-nia  \nAntah-kan apa hali dan bali.*\n\nThen he strode on to the Raja's audience hall, where Raja AMBONG AWAN UNGU received him with the greatest cordiality, stepping down to meet him and seating him on the right hand of the throne. Then a feast of the most delicious dishes was served, and the two Rajas dined together, beguiling the repast with all sorts of pleasant histories. As evening closed in, Raja AMBONG took his leave, but on his way back to his ship he halted under a *beringin* tree and sat on a swing, chatting with his companions (*ber-buei-buei di atas papan dundang tuan putri*) within view of the window of the Princess. Presently she looked out and saw him and smiled and repeated this verse:\n\n*Anak sawa sa-besar lengan  \nHandak meniti batang padi  \nHandak ter-tawa tidak ber-teeman  \nSinnyum sadikit di-dalam hati.*\n\nShe had hardly finished when Raja AMBONG replied with the following:\n\n*Selasih dulang bulih di-rapat  \nPandak ruas kaki babi  \nKakasih orang bulih ku-rebut  \nBaharu-lah puas di hati kami.*\n\n---\n\n* From infidelity one passes to perfect knowledge: broken are the stumps of the plant *si-mali-mali*: assuredly will I reach the place whence it came, caring not what tumult may follow.\n\n\u2020 A young python as thick as one's forearm would cross a stream with a rice straw for a bridge; I cannot laugh aloud for I have no companion, but I smile to myself as thoughts cross my mind.\n\n\u2021 The wood of the *selasih dulang* may be fashioned with the adze: short in the joint is the wild-boar's leg: let me carry off the beloved of another, for not till then will my heart know contentment.\nThen the Princess resumed again:\u2014\n\nApa guna kain di-bentang\nKalau tidak guntin-kan baju\nApa guna sarong handak di-sandang\nKalau tidak di-bunoh-kan madu.*\n\nIt was now night, and Raja AMBONG, with the faithful CHE ALANG of Linggi, went on board his vessel. Not to remain there however. He only exchanged his rich garments for those of an ordinary bachelor (orang per-bujang-an) and landing again made his way to the palace of the Princess. All the doors were locked with twelve padlocks, but a wave of his magic turban caused them to drop off, and the Princess found herself confronted on the threshold of her own chamber by the Prince, with whom she had been exchanging verses in the afternoon. She retired abashed, but the enterprising Prince followed her into her apartment, and attempted with winning and persuasive words to gain a place in her affection (ber-apa pujuk g\u00e9rindam dengan per-kata-an yang manis-manis akan mem-b\u00e9ri b\u00e9las dan sayu di hati tuan putri). Presently, she invited him to take refreshments, and after these had been served she enquired plainly what his business was. Raja AMBONG replied with a declaration of love, upon which the Princess, who was a magician of no mean order, disappeared from his sight. She had become a grain of sand upon the cushion upon which she had just been sitting. Raja AMBONG, finding himself alone, made a fruitless search for a while, and then returned to his ship in despair and covered with shame and confusion. Arrived in his cabin, he threw himself down on his couch and slept for seven days and nights. On the seventh night he was visited in a dream by an old man dressed in yellow robe and carrying a Malacca cane (samambu bunting) in his hands, who stood by the head of his bed, and told him all the particulars of Princess MAYANG MANGGI'S enchantments and the way to meet them. When he woke, Raja\n\n* What is the good of spreading out your cloth if you are not going to cut out a jacket? What is the use of girding on a sword-sheath unless you first put away your present wife?\nAMBONG bathed and dressed and spent the day cheerfully, waiting for nightfall to make a fresh attempt at the palace.\n\nThat night he gained across to the apartments of the Princess as before, and she received him graciously, seating him on a mat embroidered with gold (langkat yang ka-amasan) and entertaining him at a feast where dishes succeeded dishes (angkat hidang sorong hidang) with great profusion. Supper over, the Princess vanished as before. But this time Raja AMBONG profited by the information imparted to him in his dream. Blowing away the dust in the centre of the apartment, he found a speck of white sand, and seized it, upon which the Princess resumed her own form, saying \"In truth thy love is not all counterfeit.\" In another moment she had again disappeared and Raja DONAN took the form of a jungle-cock, and searched in the neighbouring wood, where he found her in the form of a hen and brought her back to the palace, where they took their own shapes again. Seven times altogether did the Princess undergo metamorphosis, taking successively, after this, the shapes of a quail, a wood-pigeon, an elephant, a dragon and a pea-fowl. Each time Raja DONAN similarly transformed himself, found her and brought her back. Then she gave up further attempts to escape and for the next three days and nights Raja AMBONG abode in her palace and a short time afterwards their marriage took place with the consent of Raja AMBONG AWAN UNGU and his chiefs.\n\nBut all this time the Princess MAYANG MANGGI was already betrothed to MAMBANG BONGSU, the son of Raja PINANG LUMUT, who dwelt up in the sky. One night this youthful Prince had a dream which disturbed him not a little. He dreamt that he was walking along in a spacious plain, when a kite swooped down and carried off his turban, and while he was chasing the bird to recover it, he himself fell headlong into a lake. Forthwith he presented himself before his parents and begged his father to interpret (ta'abir-kan) the dream for him. \"My son,\" said the old man, \"I remember an old warning, handed down to me by my ancestors, that no one should fix his affections or contract an engagement in a foreign country. If you should have done this, this dream of\nyour's no doubt betokens that some one else has taken your betrothed wife, and that your strength will not avail against his in any struggle to regain her\". MAMBANG BONGSU left his father's presence feeling as if sentence of death had been pronounced on him, but he started at once alone for the kingdom of MAYANG MANGGI, which he reached on the eighth day after setting out. Then the first thing that he saw was the Batara Saludang Mayang lying moored at the Raja's private landing-place, with her anchor cable secured to one of the posts of the palace of the Princess. Feeling sure that this was the vessel of his rival, he went on board, and walked to the bow, so alarmingly huge in bulk that CHE ALANG ran hastily to the stern to balance him. In a few words CHE ALANG scornfully referred him to Raja AMBONG, who, he said, was even then waiting for him in the Princess' palace, and quite ready to try conclusions with him. The enraged giant jumped on shore, and it seemed as if the whole country was tipped upon one side as he alighted (seperi-kan ter-singit negri itu). Making his way to the Raja's palace, he remained on the plain outside, while he sent a message to Raja AMBONG to say that he awaited him there. The Princess and her maidens went out to him, carrying refreshments of all kinds, but he haughtily declined everything in the following characteristic speech:\n\n\"Hei, tuan putri MAYANG MANGGI, ada-pun aku kamari ini bukan-nia karana rindu dan dendam akan rupa paras angkau dan bukan-nia karana ka-lapar-an nasi dan bukan-nia karana lapar penganan dan bukan-nia karana dahaga ayer, aku kamari ini handak menudong ka-malu-an dan menyapu arang di muka aku dan serta handak mengadu ka-sakti-an aku dengan laki-laki yang ada di-dalam mahligei angkau itu, jikalau sunggoh iya anak laki-laki yang lebih ka-sakti-an angkau suroh-kan turun deri-pada mahligei itu kamari di-tengah padang ini me-makan jamu-an yang telah aku sedian ini dan aku pun sedia menanti handak menerima jamu-an laki-laki yang tiada ber-budi itu.\"\n\nSo the Princess returned to the palace and wakened Raja AMBONG, who was asleep. He immediately got ready and went out to the plain where his adversary was awaiting him.\nA tremendous fight now took place. At first Raja AMBONG stood on the defensive only, and hours passed before either of the combatants was touched. They stopped for a time, ate betel-nut together and shook hands. Then the fight commenced. This time Raja AMBONG took the offensive. So fierce was the combat, and so tremendous the leaps of the combatant that a dust arose from the plain which obscured the face of the sun. Still for a long time no one was injured. At last MAMBANG BONGSU failed to parry a blow and received a wound in the forehead. \"Stop now, MAMBANG BONGSU,\" said Raja AMBONG, \"for you have got a keepsake from me in the shape of an ornament* for your forehead!\" (kavana angkau sudah dapat satu amanat deripada kami memakei kilat dahi) \"Nay,\" said MAMBANG BONSU bravely, \"no one who calls himself a man can yield on the field of battle. It were better to die where I stand\"\u2014pantang anak laki-laki undur di medan biar-lah ber-ubah nama di padang ini juga). Then the fight continued. Raja AMBONG's skill with the sword was truly marvellous. Each cut carried three minor cuts with it, and with every downward blow the sword fell seven times without being raised again! He had acquired the art from Si Raja NANDONG, who inherited it from SANG BARMA DEWA in the land of Menangkabau.\u2020 Again MAMBANG BONGSU was wounded, this time in the ear, and again Raja AMBONG jeered at him asking him why he wore a blossom of the red hibiscus in his ear. MAMBANG BONGSU replied in the same tone, and Raja AMBONG, furious, delivered a blow with his sword with such lightning velocity that it went clean through the neck of his rival without the latter knowing it. \"Try and look at the sun and moon,\" said the victor. MAMBANG BONGSU did so and at once his head fell off and rolled on the ground.\n\nThe fight being over, Raja AMBONG returned to the palace, and the giant was buried by the people. Soon after this\n\n* Kilat dahi, an ornament cut out of tinsel gummed on the forehead of a bride.\n\u2020 Sakali chinchang tiga anak-nia ber-turut, sakali kerat tujoh anak ber-kandong di-dalam-nia, ber-kena per-main-an kipas Si Raja Nandong ka-turun-an deri Sang Barma Dewa di negri Menangkabau.\nRaja AMBONG thought that it was time to return to Tanjong Bima, from which he had now been absent for three years three months and ten days. He obtained the permission of his father-in-law to go, and again embarked in the Batara Suludang Mayang with his wives, the Princesses RENEK JINTAN and MAYANG MANGGI and his sister Princess CHANDRA RUPA. At Tanjong Bima they met with a most affectionate welcome from the chiefs and people. Shortly afterwards the faithful CHE ALANG of Linggi was married with great rejoicings to the Princess BONGSU CHANDRA RUPA.\n\nCHE ALANG after his marriage returned to his native land, Linggi, at the mouth of the river Limau Purut, taking his wife with him and there they settled down and lived happily.\n\nRaja AMBONG and his two Queens lived in harmony and happiness, and, under his just rule, his subjects increased and his country prospered.\n\nW. E. MAXWELL.\nREPORT ON THE PADI-BORER.\n\nMy attention was called to this subject, by a letter dated the 1st of January, 1887, that was forwarded to me by H. M.'s Assistant Resident of P\u00e9r\u00e1k from Dr. LEECH, the Collector and Magistrate of the Krian District, in which he says:\u2014\n\n\"With this letter I have the honour to forward you a bottle containing some specimens of a maggot which is at present playing havoc with the padi crop here. This is the third season I have heard of its attacks, and each year has been worse than the preceding one. The time, it appears, is just as the ear is beginning to form.\n\n\"Many (maggots) are found in one stalk, the whole inside of which becomes brown and rotten. I have seen acres of padi attacked in the way, with the stalks and ears complete, but without a single grain of rice in them. It appears that it makes no difference, whether the land is dry or wet. I have not been able to ascertain what sort of insect produces these maggots.\n\n\"If any method of destroying them could be got, it would be a great blessing to the people of this district, as the ravages committed by this maggot, far exceed those of the rats or pigs\u2014the other enemies of the padi crop.\n\n\"Perhaps the Curator of the Museum or H. M.'s Resident may know something of the habits of this pest, and suggest some means of destroying it.\"\n\nOn the 12th January, I suggested the burning of the straw after the harvest, and Dr. LEECH sent out a Malay notice recommending this course to the cultivators in his district.\n\nSince January, I have visited the padi-fields and have pro-\ncured specimens of the caterpillars, which I have kept, and have bred from them the perfect insects. The results of these observations I will now proceed to detail, beginning with the description of the various stages of the Padi-Borer Moth.\n\n**Description.**\n\n*Chilo species affin.* C. Oryz\u00e6llus of Riley.\n\nThe egg is oval shaped and white, faintly tinted with green. It has a finely pitted surface with some irregular, longitudinal creases. They are laid in masses of thirty or more together, in a slanting, overlapping, double, treble, or more extended series, and are firmly cemented together, and to the leaves on which they are laid. The egg is about $\\frac{3}{100}$th inch long by $\\frac{1}{100}$th inch wide.\n\n*Larva.*\u2014Head dark brown, polished, furnished with a few stiff brownish hairs, a median yellowish line. Cervical shield varies from light to dark brown, with a median yellowish line. Colour of body pale yellowish white, slightly transparent, marked with five rather indistinct, pale purplish stripes, of which those bordering the stigmata are scarcely half as broad as the other three. The piliferous spots are oval, yellowish coloured and polished, stigmata small, transversely oval, brown, the last pair twice as large as the others, these latter are sometimes pale centred. Anal plate yellowish, polished, furnished with a row of three hairs upon each side and two near middle, it is marked with a few purplish spots.\n\nLength $\\frac{3}{5}$th to $\\frac{1}{10}$th inch. Diameter $\\frac{1}{10}$th to $\\frac{3}{5}$th inch.\n\n*Pupa.*\u2014Colour pale yellowish brown, with five brown longitudinal stripes. As it nears maturity it assumes a dark brown colour, wing cases paler and with a pearly lustre. Head bent forward, its front somewhat pointed. Thorax with very fine transverse stri\u00e6. Abdominal joints, armed dorsally, near their anterior margin, with numerous very minute brown thorns. Stigmata projecting. Tip of last joint conical, with a longitudinal lateral impression; expanding dorsally into two flattened projections, each being divided into two broad teeth. There are also two projections from the lower surface of the\nlast joint, one on each side of the longitudinal impression. Length $\\frac{3}{10}$th to $\\frac{6}{10}$th inch, and diameter $\\frac{3}{40}$th to $\\frac{1}{10}$th inch.\n\n*Imago.*\u2014Male, above, general colour pale ochraceous. Anterior wings, with an irregular oblique fuscous fascia, from about the middle of inner margin to near the apex of wing. Costal and posterior margins ochraceous, fringe golden. A marginal line of seven small brown spots and a submarginal line of shining golden brown spots, along the posterior margin, but curving away from the apex. Some of these shining spots are also scattered over the oblique fuscous fascia, more thickly near the end of the cell.\n\nHind wings paler and unmarked. Beneath, anterior wings dull yellowish, sometimes sullied with dirty brown. Hind wings the same, but only slightly tinged with brown on the costal region. Body and legs same colour as palest part of wings.\n\nLabial palpi bushy and slightly broadened at tip, horizontal, nearly as long as head and thorax together, a few dark scales and hairs intermixed with the paler ones. Maxillary palpi prominent, with only a few dark scales. Eyes black. Antenn\u00e6 more than half the length of the costal margin of the anterior wings, filiform, clothed with pale ochraceous scales. Expanse $\\frac{7}{10}$th to $\\frac{8}{10}$th inch, and body $\\frac{3}{10}$th to $\\frac{4}{10}$th inch long.\n\nThe female differs in being duller in colour and in the fascia on anterior wings being very indistinct. Beneath dull pale ochraceous. Labial palpi more bushy and larger than in the male. Expanse $\\frac{12}{20}$th of an inch, and body $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long.\n\nThis insect evidently belongs to the genus *Chilo* of Zincken-Sommer, and may not be specifically distinct from *C. Oryzaellus* of Riley, as the differences noticeable in it may be only of a variatal character.\n\nA comparison with the type specimen would be necessary to determine this point. *C. Oryzaellus* is an insect of much the same habits as ours, and found in North America.\n\n*Natural History and Habits.*\n\nThe eggs are laid in white irregular shaped masses, which may measure as much as $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch in length, by nearly $\\frac{1}{10}$ inch\nin width, on the leaves of the padi plant. The eggs after a few days become greyish, from the formation of the young caterpillars inside them. In the case of one female that I reared, eleven such masses were deposited in one night, and seven the next. One mass that I counted under the microscope, contained 39 eggs, so that it would be safe to say, that one female will lay as many as 600 eggs.\n\nAs there was not much choice possible in this case, nothing could be gleaned as to the part of the plant which would be selected, in a state of nature, by the female to deposit her eggs on, except that no eggs are deposited on the stem of the plant. Judging from the position of the young caterpillars, the part selected is at the junction of a young leaf with the stalk.\n\nFrom this point, as soon as the eggs are hatched, the young caterpillars eat their way into the tender shoot or into the midrib of the leaf in the case of the first brood, as will be mentioned further on. On exhausting the supply of food in the growing shoot, they bore out and re-enter the stalk lower down.\n\nThe caterpillar makes a nearly circular hole where it enters a stalk, which it closes up from the inside, with faecal pellets and some fine white silk, and sometimes with the latter substance alone. When a caterpillar has eaten all the inner lining of one joint, or as much of it as it fancies, it either bores out again, and enters another joint, usually lower down the stalk, or it bores through the substance of the joint itself. This latter method of seeking for a fresh supply of food I have seen adopted on several occasions, both in the straws picked in the field and also in those I have kept for purposes of observation. Sometimes it is the bottom of a joint, and sometimes the top which is thus perforated.\n\nThe stalks are usually more eaten near the joints than elsewhere, and often the film remaining is so thin, that the stalk breaks short off. When the caterpillar is short of food, it will feed on the inner lining of the leafstalks. This has happened in my breeding experiments, and I have also noticed it in the fields.\nIn the first brood of the season, the food of the caterpillar is principally supplied by the growing shoot, and the interior of the midrib of the leaves and leafstalks. This first brood reaches maturity before any appreciable amount of hollow stalk is formed by the padi, and hence this change, in what may be considered its normal habits, is necessary, to adapt itself to its environment. The pup\u00e6 of this first brood are nearly always found in the leafstalks. In subsequent broods they are generally found in the inside of the stalk, sometimes above the hole of entrance and sometimes beneath it. The pup\u00e6 are usually more or less enclosed in a fine white web, and the head is, in all cases that have come under my observation, uppermost.\n\nThe larv\u00e6 are able to progress with nearly equal facility either backwards or forwards, but they are not active at any time, and when disturbed generally remain quiescent.\n\nIn a single stool of young padi, I found no less than 20 caterpillars. This plant was found growing by itself in Taiping and not near any padi fields, probably the nearest being more than two or three miles away. This seems to show, either that the moths take long flights, or that some wild plant serves as food for the caterpillar as well as padi.\n\nWhen kept in confinement, the moths sit quite still all day, and by preference on the earth at the bottom of the breeding cage. It seems, therefore, probable that they sit usually on the dead leaves of the padi during the day time, and as their colour so nearly assimilates to it, this would be a position of great security. I have hunted over a field of padi for them, but without success, though the straw was full of full grown caterpillars and also of minute ones, and there must have been many of the moths about. In the day time it is difficult to get them to fly even when touched, but at night they are fairly active and seem to be able to fly well.\n\nThe female begins laying her eggs on the second night after coming out of the chrysalis, and they hatch out on the fifth day, the female dying in about seven days. The eggs seem to be all laid on the second and third night. The males in a state of captivity, only live from three to four days.\nThe antenn\u00e6 of the moth are carried, laid back on the wings, and have to be looked closely for, or they will pass unnoticed.\n\nUsually only one caterpillar is formed in a stalk of padi, but I have found as many as five on one or two occasions. Judging from the breeding experiments, several stalks may be required to afford sufficient food for the support of a single caterpillar.\n\nNumber of Broods.\n\nOn the 29th April, or more than six weeks after the harvest in this district, I found in the padi stalks several minute caterpillars as well as many more advanced, in fact they ranged from one-eighth of an inch to full grown ones. I also examined a young stool of padi and found in it four or five chrysalides. This clearly shows that a brood has time to mature before the padi has begun to throw up stalks, and taken with the presence of the caterpillars in all stages in the straw after the harvest, it is probable that three broods arrive at maturity before the harvest, and that there are three more between then and the next planting, making about six in the year. That would be two months for each generation.\n\nNatural Enemies.\n\nOut of one lot of four grubs raised by me, three were destroyed by the larva of some other insect, and on an examination of a padi field one day, I found no less than five live pup\u00e6 and three empty cases of the same parasite, and not one single live pupa of the rice-borer, and only two or three empty cases. This parasitic larva is, therefore, one of the most powerful aids in checking the increase of these destructive pests, and it would seem that, without its help, the cultivation of padi in the Malay fashion would be quite impossible.\n\nThe parasitic insect, to which we are so much indebted, is a fly, in appearance much like a common house-fly; and its\nlarva is a small white maggot, which is either laid in or on the body of the rice-borer, and which lives inside its body and soon destroys it.\n\n**Description.**\n\nOrder, Diptera.  \nTachinaric\u00e6.  \n\nFamily, Muscid\u0153.  \nGenus and Species, (?)\n\n**Larva.**\u2014Milk white and semi-transparent. Skin shiny, the anterior and posterior quarter of each segment armed with minute brown thorns. Cylindrical, with the head not distinct from body; which is abruptly terminated posteriorly and conically anteriorly. On last segment a pair of warm brown stigmata. Mouth furnished with two black hook-like organs. Length of a full grown one, that I extracted from a dead padi-borer, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch, and diameter \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\)th inch.\n\nThe thorns on the body of the maggot are evidently the means of locomotion inside the body of its host. In two padi-borers that I opened, the head of the maggot was towards the tail of its host. The larva is very difficult to kill; withstand- ing immersion in spirits for a period of two and a half hours.\n\n**Pupa.**\u2014Cylindrical, with rounded ends, of a warm brown colour. Length \\( \\frac{9}{10} \\)th inch, and \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\)th inch in diameter.\n\nThe insect continues in the pupa state from twelve to thirteen days.\n\n**Imago.**\u2014Head silvery grey with red brown eyes and black bristles. Antenn\u00e6 with three joints, of which the last is the largest, a single long hair projecting from near base of third joint. Palpi consist of a single joint. Above, thorax black with grey stripe on each side and two others on the dorsal aspect. Scutellum grey except central portion, which is black. Abdomen black, with three silvery transverse stripes, partly interrupted on the median line. Hairs on abdomen black, conspicuous on the two last segments. Wings hyaline, iridescent, unmarked; halteres covered by large milk white scales. Beneath wholly black, except three faint grey transverse stripes on abdomen. Legs black. Length \\( \\frac{7}{10} \\)th inch and \\( \\frac{6}{10} \\)th inch across wings; the female is a little larger.\nIn confinement these flies live from four to five days. I have not been able to observe the method in which the fly gets at the padi-borer to lay its egg, or young, as the case may be; but it is probably when the latter leaves one joint of the stalk in search of more food that the fly effects its purpose.\n\nEffects on the Crop.\n\nAs I have already stated, the first brood of caterpillars matures before the rice has made any stalk, and that its food consists of the midribs of the leaves and the growing shoot. This leads to the death of those young shoots which are infested by the borer. The next brood which pass their lives inside the stalk are those which cause the abortive ears of rice, and are, therefore, the most destructive to the crop. Though the first brood by killing the growing shoots of course do very considerable damage.\n\nIn the letter I have already quoted, Dr. Leech has given his experience in the Krian district, and from what I have seen in Larut, nearly as much loss has been inflicted on the crops here.\n\nPreventive Measures.\n\nBy the Malay way of harvesting, only the ears of the padi plant are cut, and the straw is left standing in the fields until the next planting season comes round. Hence all the caterpillars and chrysalides have an opportunity of maturing and continuing the species to the next season's crop.\n\nThe perpetuation of the race from one season to another is undoubtedly carried on through the self-sown rice and the lateral shoots of the old plants, though it is possible that some large stemmed grass may play a minor part in the matter.\n\nI found, six weeks after the harvest, in this district, that the straw was swarming with caterpillars of all ages; and I was informed by the Malays, that the shoots of the old plants and the self-sown rice, would continue alive until the land was broken up again for the next planting; so that food is avail-\nable throughout the year for the sustenance of the successive broods of caterpillars.\n\nA consideration of these facts, as well as of the life history of the borer, leads to the conclusion that the method which is most likely to keep down its numbers, is to destroy the straw by fire as soon after the harvest as possible, and to take any measures that will tend to kill or prevent the growth of the self-sown rice, between the harvest and the next year's sowing.\n\nWith the efficient help which is given by the parasitic fly I have already mentioned, there should not be much difficulty in comparatively freeing the padi fields of this very destructive scourge, if the cultivators could only be induced to take a little united action.\n\nL. WRAY, JR.,\nCurator, P\u00e9raK Museum.\n\nADDENDA.\n\nSince the above was written, further research has brought to light another insect associated with the one I have already described, and of almost the same habits and general appearance. In fact so close is the resemblance that it was not until the change from the larva state took place, that I noticed any difference; except that the caterpillar was nearly uniform pale brownish pink and without the five purplish longitudinal stripes. This was unfortunate, as I did not make a close examination or take down a description of this stage of the borer.\n\nThe other stages of its life were, however, recorded, and are as follows:\u2014\n\nPupa.\u2014Colour pale brown, darker at head, tail and margins of joints, with a white bloom over the whole. Head only slightly bent forward, its front somewhat rounded. Eyes projecting, black. Thorax minutely pitted. Abdominal joints also minutely pitted and with dark brown depressed spots scattered irregularly over them, more thickly on their anterior halves. Stigmata projecting. Tip of last joint rounded with\na small projection which is produced into four sharp teeth, the two lower ones pointing downwards and the upper ones backwards.\n\nLength $\\frac{6}{10}$th inch, and diameter nearly $\\frac{2}{10}$th inch.\n\n*Imago.*\u2014Above, anterior wings pale yellowish-brown, with a violet-brown stripe from insertion of wing to about the middle of the posterior margin, along the median nervure. This stripe broadens towards the posterior margin, which is shaded with the same colour. A distant series of five small brown sub-marginal spots along the posterior margin, and a spot near median nervure opposite end of cell. Tinge shining pale golden brown.\n\nPosterior wings silvery white slightly tinted with yellow.\n\nBeneath, pale silvery yellowish brown: hind wings paler than the anterior ones.\n\nHead much depressed, eyes dark brown, invisible from above, thorax clothed with long hairs, ochraceous towards neck and paler towards abdomen. Thorax beneath densely clothed with long hair, as are also the two upper joints of the legs. Antennae one quarter the length of costal margin, filiform, yellowish-brown, clothed with a few short hairs. Labial palpi short, scarcely projecting beyond face. Last joint short and clothed with close, short scales. The scales on the remainder of palpi bushy, some dark ones mixed with the paler.\n\nExpanse of wings $1\\frac{2}{10}$th inch, length $\\frac{6}{10}$th inch.\n\nThis moth appears to have the same habits as the other species; but it is not nearly so numerous in the Larut padi fields. I have only met with two examples out of the many borers I have raised, though possibly in other parts of the country it may be the more plentiful and destructive of the two.\n\nIt does not seem to remain in the chrysalis longer than the other, nor is its life in the perfect state any more extended, so that any measures that would be efficacious in preventing the spread of the one would be equally applicable to the other.\n\nL. W., Jr.\nSUMMARY OF THE REPORT ON THE POMELOE MOTH.\n\nAt the request of the British Resident of P\u00e9rah, I made an enquiry into the cause of the destruction of all the pomelo fruit grown in the Residency gardens at Kwala Kangsa, and have ascertained, from actual observations and breeding experiments, that it is primarily to the attacks of the caterpillars of a small moth, that the loss is due.\n\nThe life history of this insect is, as far as I have been able to observe it, as follows:\n\nThe eggs are laid singly and in small irregular patches on the lower side of the fruit, and when they hatch out, the young caterpillars eat their way into the fruit making a number of minute holes through the rind, generally over an area of about the size of a shilling. The pith under this patch is riddled with holes, and gum is often subsequently found, both in the cavities of the rind, and also on the outside of the fruit.\n\nAs the caterpillars increase in size, they eat their way through and through the fruit, and make holes through the rind to eject refuse, and also possibly to obtain air. To these holes uneatable portions of the fruit and faecal pellets are carried by the caterpillars and ejected.\n\nThe caterpillars, which are active, quick-moving insects, jump and twist when touched, and, for caterpillars, can progress with considerable speed. On arriving at maturity, they leave the fruit, and descending to the ground bury themselves in the earth to undergo the change into the pupa state; the caterpillars make in the earth cells of agglutinated earth, lined with white silk; they measure 0.7 inch in length, 0.4 inch in breadth, and 0.3 inch in depth.\n\nOn the twelfth day after quitting the fruit, the transform-\nation is complete, and the moth forces its way through the cell and up out of the earth.\n\nThe perfect insect is about an inch across the wings and of a warm brown colour with shadings of silvery grey. In the daytime it is very quiet and sits usually on the earth of the breeding cages, the head and forepart of the body being much raised, and the antennae laid back on the wings, which are closed and folded closely over the body. When in this position, it is a very inconspicuous object, both as regards colour and form. At night it seems to be lively and is possessed of fairly good powers of flight.\n\nThe first four moths I raised all died in a little over two days, and though they consisted of two of each sex, no eggs were laid. On dissection of the females I found the eggs to be immature and few in number, and deduced from their state, that the insect does not deposit its eggs until some days after leaving the chrysalis and that during that time it needs food to enable it to perpetuate its species.\n\nWith the next brood of moths I put various fruits, but none of these seemed to their taste, for though they lived for five or six days, and laid a few eggs, none of these proved fertile. In all I raised over thirty of these insects without getting one egg that would hatch.\n\nIt seems quite possible that as the fruit on which they feed during the caterpillar stage is seasonal and that there are periods of months at a time during which no food is available that the moths are long-lived, and until their natural food during the imago portion of their lives is discovered, attempts at artificial breeding will be unsuccessful.\n\n**DESCRIPTION.**\n\n*Egg.*\u2014Oval, dirty white, translucent with fine raised, irregular network covering surface. Length .04 inch, and breadth .025 inch. When laid they take the form of flattened ovals with the lower side following the shape of the object on which they are laid, and the upper surface convex.\n\n*Larva.*\u2014General colour bluish-green, tinted above with\npinkish bronze. The four anterior segments being less tinted than the remainder, the young are almost wholly of a rather dull pink. Length of adult .86 inch, breadth .35 inch.\n\nPupa.\u2014General colour warm brown, darkening towards the tail, wing sheaths dull green for the first few days, after which they become dark brown. A dark median line from tail to thorax on the dorsal aspect. Length .5 inch breadth .17 inch.\n\nEffect on the Fruit.\n\nThe caterpillar of the pomeloe moth is able to pierce uninjured the natural defences of the fruit, disregarding both the pungent oil of the rind, and the thick layer of pith beneath it, it reaches the cellular portion of the fruit, which it tunnels through and through in all directions passing through and through in all directions, passing through the seeds if they happen to be in its line, but apparently not seeking them out. Faecal matter is deposited in the burrows, and decomposition as a consequence quickly sets in on its walls. Under the microscope, the fluid contents of any cell which has had its containing sac broken by the passage of the caterpillar is seen to be teeming with bacterial life of many kinds. Carefully detaching a sac adjoining one that had been broken by a caterpillar, but which was in itself quite perfect, and microscopically examining its contained fluid, there appeared many bacteria. The most frequent form being masses of cocci; many other forms were present, but in smaller numbers.\n\nAn oval saccharomyces was very plentiful in the injured cells, and is the probable cause of the acid fermentation which takes place in them. It was not present in the adjoining unbroken ones. Presumably the smaller forms only can pass from cell to cell through the connecting vessels.\n\nIt is probably to this secondary attack of micro-organisms that the premature ripening and falling of the fruit may be ascribed, more than to the actual injury done by the caterpillars themselves; other insects taking advantage of the holes made by the caterpillars through the rind can enter the fruit\nand lay their eggs in the pith and pulp, with the result that large rotten patches spread from the entrance and exit holes. These insects are two or three species of flies, and a small brown beetle, all of which are attracted by any decaying fruit.\n\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES.\n\nThe life history of the pomeloe moth shows that there is only a period of its existence when there is any hope of destroying it in useful numbers, and that is when it is in the caterpillar stage inside the fruit. The eggs are small and so like the oil cells on which they are laid, that without a lens it is difficult to see them; in the pupa state, which is passed beneath the ground, they are well out of reach, and in the perfect stage, being strictly nocturnal and very inconspicuous, there would be little chance of doing any good.\n\nThe only suggestion that I can make is to destroy all fruit that is seen to be inhabited by the caterpillars, or which falls from the trees. The destruction of the fruit which falls is of importance not only as a means of killing the insects contained in it, but also as preventing its serving for the rearing of another brood.\n\nAs the eggs seem to be laid only on the fruit itself, it would appear that if the young fruits are put into bags, that they would have a chance of arriving at maturity.\n\nI am inclined to think that the wild species of *citrus*, known by the native name of *limau kerbau*, and which is apparently nearly allied to the pomeloe, *citrus decumana*, is the natural food of these caterpillars, as it is a fairly common tree in the jungles of some parts of P\u00e9raK.\n\nL. WRAY, JR.\nCurator, P\u00e9raK Museum.\nMANANGISM IN BORNEO.\n\nWHERE all rational conception of the causes of disease and of medicine is entirely absent, magical ceremonies, incantations, pretensions to supernatural powers in the cure of the sick have the whole field before them; whilst fear and anxiety in cases of illness lead to an eager credulity which clutches at any projected means of cure, however absurd in themselves: hence among the lower races of mankind, the medicine man is an important personage and as indispensable to the well-being of Society. The Dyaks of Borneo are no exception; they have their \"Manangs.\" And as these are not reluctant to communicate their medical beliefs, and as their belief is also the belief of the Dyaks generally, it is not difficult to set down a general view of their theories, as well as their practices. The peculiar attribute of the Manang is the possession of mysterious powers rather than special knowledge.\n\nBut though the Manang function is procured for all serious ailments, yet the treatment of the sick is not confined to it. Dyaks use a few simples as outward applications, things composed for the most part of leaves of plants. The betelnut and pepper leaf mixture is also used as an outward application for almost any malady. Some man, supposed to be lucky, is called in; he chews a quantity of this hot and stimulant mixture in his mouth, leans over the body, and squirts the saliva over the affected part, and gently rubs it in with his fingers. Dyaks in a burning fever with acute headache will be seen with their foreheads smeared over with it. And this dirty mess is supposed to possess great virtue in promoting the growth of newly born children, whose bodies, up to a certain age, are half covered with daily applications of it by their mothers. Other unprofessional modes of\ncure are practised by certain Dyaks, to whom, through the medium of dreams, benevolent spirits have made known medicinal charms for special diseases, such as pebbles, roots and leaves of various plants, bits of wood, and even feathers and scraps of matting, etc. The pebbles are rubbed in water which is applied externally; the woods, feathers and matting are burnt, and the ashes applied.\n\nBut these are of very minor importance compared with the functions of the Manangs, who alone are believed to wield power over the malignant spirits which cause sickness. All internal maladies are supposed to be inflicted by the passing, or the touch of demons inimical to mankind. What is the matter with so and so? you ask. He is \"pansa utei,\" \"something passed him;\" he is struck by a demon who desires to carry off his soul to the other world. Consistent with this idea, somebody is required who can cope with the evil spirit and prevent the soul from being hurried away. And the Manang comes forth as the man, ready to charm, cajole or kill the spirit, and rescue the departing soul from his clutches by a performance which is called \"Belian.\" Some years ago a Dyak lad was sleeping in my house, and in the early morning was seized with epileptic fits. The friends came and took him away, and soon the Manangs were walking round and chanting over him. After the function was over, the chief Manang gave out that a party of spirits returning from a hunting expedition, caught sight of the lad, and thrust a spear at him; but that had they recognised the house as mine, they would have spared him.\n\nNearly all diseases then are believed to arise from ghostly causes, or at least to be accompanied by sneaking evil spirits; and the sorcerer must deal with these intangible and demoniacal influences. But some maladies are too terrible for even his mystical powers. Nothing is more thoroughly believed to be the direct personal influence of evil spirits than the epidemic scourges of cholera and small-pox; but seldom will Manangs go near a case of either; probably a consciousness of the utter futility of their efforts, combined with fear of infection, have induced them to assert that such cases do not come within the reach of their powers. Other means must be\nresorted to, among which propitiatory sacrifices and offerings predominate.\n\nThe stock in trade of a Manang is a \"lupong,\" a medicine box, generally made of bark-skin, which is filled with \"obat,\" medicinal charms, consisting of scraps of wood and bark, bits of curiously twisted roots, and odd knotty sticks, pebbles, fragments of quartz, and possibly a coloured glass marble, cum multis aliis. These charms are either inherited, or revealed by the spirits in dreams as possessed of medicinal virtue. The coloured glass marble, where not previously known, is an \"obat\" of great power. On one occasion in my neighbourhood years ago, a travelling Manang belauded the efficacy of one of these toys of civilisation, saying, I think, that it was the \"egg of a star,\" and that he had given the whitemen's doctor two dollars for it. Among the audience was a Dyak to whose son I had given a similar marble, and he said: \"may we see this great medicine?\" The Manang produced it. \"Oh,\" said the other, \"the Tuan Padri yonder has got plenty of these. He gave my boy one.\" The Manang speedily replaced the marble, and changed the conversation to a more unsuspicious direction. If an unscrupulous trader were to take into the interior of Borneo a cargo of these marbles with holes bored through them to enable them to be worn round the neck, he would make enormous profits. One which I had given to a child was afterwards sold for a brass gong worth three dollars.\n\nAnother and a principal \"obat\" contained in the \"lupong\" is \"Batu Ilau,\" \"Stone of Light,\" a bit of quartz chrystal, by virtue of whose mysterious power the Manang is enabled to perceive the character of different diseases, and to see the soul, and catch it after it has wandered away from the body: for it is an article of Manang faith that in all sicknesses the soul leaves the body, and wanders about at greater or less distance from its mortal tenement; if it can be caught within a returnable point, and recovered before having proceeded too far on the journey to Hades, well and good; if not, the patient dies.\n\nThe Manang never carries his own \"lupong,\" but the people who fetch him must carry it for him. He comes to the house in the evening; for he never performs in daylight\nunless the case is very bad, and the people pay him well for it; to \"belian\" during the day, he says, is difficult and dangerous work. Sitting down by the patient, after some inquiries, he takes out of his \"lupong\" a boar's tusk, or a smooth pebble, or some other \"obat\" of magical virtue, and gently strokes the body with it; then he gravely looks into his \"Batu llau\" to diagnose the character of the disease and the condition of the soul, and to discover the proper \"pelian\" needed for its restoration and then tells them what sort of function he would prescribe. If there be several Manangs called in, the leader undertakes the preliminary examination, the rest giving their assent. This done they retire to the outside public verandah of the house, where has been prepared a \"Pagar Api,\" which is a long handled spear fixed blade upwards in the middle of the verandah with a few leaves of some sort tied round it, and having at its base the \"lupongs\" of each Manang. Why it is called \"Pagar Api,\" \"Fence of Fire,\" no one has been able to tell me. Then the leader begins a long monotonous drawl at the rate of about two words a minute, which, however, increases in velocity as the performance proceeds; the rest either chanting with him, or joining in at choruses, or may be singing antiphonally with him, all squatting on the floor. After a tiresome period of this dull drawling, they stand up, and march with slow and solemn step round the 'Pagar Api,' the monotonous chant slackening or quickening as they march the whole night through with only one interval for a feed in the middle of the night. The patient simply lies on his mats and listens. Most of the matter chanted in these Manang performance is unmeaning rubbish. They begin by describing in prolix and grandiose language all the parts of a Dyak house; but how such an irrelevant descant can effect the cure of a fever or a diarrhoea is a mystery to all but themselves. Then they \"bark at the sickness,\" in other words, call upon it to be off to the ends of the earth, and to return to the regions of the unseen world: they invoke the aid of spirits, and of ancient worthies and unworthies down to their own immediate ancestors, and spin the invocations out to a sufficient length to bring them to the daylight hours. Here the grand climax is reached\u2014the tru-\nant soul has to be caught. If the patient is apparently in a dangerous state, they pretend the soul has escaped far away, perhaps to the river; and they will wave about a garment, or a piece of woven cloth, to imitate the action of throwing a cast net to inclose it as a fish is caught; perhaps they give out that it has escaped into the jungle, and they will rush out of the house to circumvent and secure it there; perhaps they will say it has been carried away over seas to unknown lands, and will all set to and play at paddling a boat to follow it. But more generally the operation is made a more simple one. The Manangs rush round the \"Pagar Api\" as hard as they can, singing a not unpleasing chant, until one of them falls on the floor and remains motionless; the others sit down. The bystanders cover the motionless Manang with a blanket, and wait whilst his spirit is supposed to hie away to Hades, or wherever the erring soul has been carried, and to bring it back. Presently he revives, looks vacantly about like a man just waking out of sleep, then he rises with his right hand clenched as if holding something. That hand contains the soul; and the Manang proceeds to the patient, and returns it to the body through the crown of the head, muttering at the same time a few words of incantation. This \"nangkap semengat,\" \"catching the soul,\" is the great end, to which all that has preceded is only preliminary, and which only a fully equipped Manang is competent to perform. As the devouring demon is supposed to be driven away by the magical arts and charms of the Manang, so the soul is allured into submission to him by his persuasive invitations and melodious cadences. And as he approaches the point of accomplishing this grand feat of spiritual power, he sings thus:\n\n*Trebai puna nepan di lamba kitap,  \nSemengat lari nengah lengkap,  \nAntu ngagai jaya jayap.*\n\n*Trebai puna nepan di lamba midong,  \nSemengat lari nengah darong,  \nAntu ngagai nengah darong.*\nTrebai puna nepan di lamba pulu,\nSemengat lari nengah mungu,\nAntu ngagai ambis teransu.\n\nTrebai puna nepan di lamba jita,\nSemengat lari niki tangga,\nAntu ngagai nyau nda meda.\n\nNyau dialu Ini Betik enggo rarik pulong temiang.\nNyau dialu Ini Jurei enggo lukai redak tenchang.\nNyau dialu Ini Menyaia enggo tuba bau sinang.\nNyau dialu Ini Mampu enggo resu garu tulang.\nDikurong Ini Impong di benong tajau bujang.\nDitutup enggo Keliling gong selang.\nDikungkong enggo Kawat panjai Kelingkang.\nDitambit enggo sabit bekait punggang.\nNiki ka tuchong Rabong rarengang.\n\nThe dove flies and lights on the *kitap* (1) sapling,\nThe soul escapes along the hollow valley,\nThe demon pursues in dishevelled haste.\n\nThe dove flies and lights on the *medong* (1) sapling,\nThe soul escapes through the ravine,\nThe demon pursues through the ravine.\n\nThe dove flies and lights on the *pulu* ( ) sapling,\nThe soul escapes along the hill,\nAs the demon pursues, let him stumble.\n\nThe dove flies and lights on the *jita* (1) sapling,\nThe soul runs to climb the ladder (of house),\nThe pursuing demon sees it no more.\n\n(1) Dyak names for jungle trees.\nIt is met by Grandmother Betik, (1)\nWith a long stick of big knotted bambu,\nIt is met by Grandmother Jurei, (1)\nWith finely powdered lukai (2) bark,\nIt is met by Grandmother Menyaia, (1)\nWith the acrid smelling tuba.

And as the Manang does this, he sings a special invocation, which I give as a sample of the Manang traditional lore, and of Dyak belief on the subject of sacrifice:\n\nThe speckled fowl for sacrificial waving and cleansing.\nFor doctoring for resisting,\nFor sweeping for atoning,\nFor exchanging for buying,\nA substitute for the feet, substitute for the hands,\nA substitute for the face, substitute for the life.\n\nYe fowls enable us to escape the curse muttered unheard:\nTo neutralize the spittle (of the enemy);\nTo correct the speech of the angry despiser;\nTo make nought the visions of half waking moments;\nTo scare away evil dreams for ever;\nTo make harmless one's ghost (4) passing the farm;\n\n(1) Names of ancient Manangs, or of Manang tutelary deities.\n(2) The \"lukai\" bark when burnt emits a very pungent smell, and the root of the \"tuba\" (Derris eliptica) possesses well known poisonous properties, and evil spirits are thought to have a wholesome dread of both.\n(3) Rabong and Sintong, two adjoining mountains on the upper Kapuas in Dutch Borneo may be said to be.\n(4) The \"Jeda\" is the ghost of a living man seen by another person.\nTo neutralize the ill omen bird flying across the path;\nTo cut off the katupong's flight coming from the left;\nTo cover its screeching;\u2014a bird of dread effect;\nTo make harmless the pangkas, a hot tempered bird;\nTo counteract the omen of the low voiced deer.\nHence ye fowls are for waving and for offering.\n\nBut will not bodies of birds suffice?\nThe bodies of the top knot jungle fowl which fills the lowland with long and gentle whistling,\nThe bodies of long necked cranes covering the hill,\nThe bodies of argus pheasants upon the hillocks of the plain,\nThe bodies of fire back pheasants filling the lowland jungle.\nThe bodies of blue kingfishers a pool full just coming from pecking on the big spreading rock,\nThe bodies of one kneed moorhens filling the gully,\nThe bodies of red beaked hornbills filling the ravine,\nThe bodies of adjutant birds in the swamp, like kings with covered feet,\nThe bodies of owls, a flock, sitting without doffing their hats;\nMany may be the birds, and many the minas,\nBodies of hornbills, and bodies of green parrots;\nBut all are ineffectual for waving, for offering:\nThey are not worth a fowl as big as the fingers.\nThat is the thing for waving and for offering.\n\nYe fowls were ever the race ever the seed (for sacrifice),\nFrom our grandfathers and grandmothers,\nFrom ancient times, from chiefs of old,\nDown to your fathers and mothers:\nBecause we give you rice, we breed you,\nWe give you food, give you nourishment,\nWe hang for you nests, we make for you roosts;\nWe make you coops, we make you baskets:\nHence ye fowls are used for substituting for buying,\nSubstitutes for the face, substitutes for the life.\nYe fowls are possessed with much foolishness and mischief:\nYe have many sins, many uncleannesses,\nMany evils and much viciousness,\nYe are in debt for sugar-cane as long as a pole;\nIn debt for plantains a long bunch;\nIn debt for potatoes got by planting;\nIn debt for melons with flattened ends;\nIn debt for pumpkins one man's load;\nIn debt for kladi growing to perfection;\nIn debt for maize a handful or two;\nIn debt for shoots of the moon cucumber;\nIn debt for paddy a deep big bin;\nIn debt for rice in the earthenware jar;\nHence ye fowls are for waving and for offering.\n\nThe ubah tree falls upon the kumpang sapling.\nYe fowls have many crimes and many debts;\nYe bear the spirits of sickness, spirits of illness;\nThe spirits of fever and ague, spirits of cold and headache;\nThe spirits of cold, the spirits of the forest;\nYe bear them, ye are filled with them;\nYe pile them up, ye put them in a basket;\nYe carry them, ye take them clear away;\nYe conduct them oft, ye gather them;\nYe drag them along, ye lift them up;\nYe embrace them, ye carry them in your bosom;\nYe fowls have beaks as sharp as augers;\nYour feathers are like fringes of red thread;\nYour ear feathers like sharpened stakes of bambu;\nYour wings flap like folds of red of cloth;\nYour tails are bent downwards like dragging ropes;\nYour crops weigh heavily like many iron hawkbills;\nYour nails are like sharp iron knives.\n\nYe fowls scare away sickness, and make it run\nTo the opening dawn of the morning,\nTo the end of the further heavens,\nTo where kingfishers ever screech,\nTo the end of the muntjac's run,\nTo the place of the setting sun,\nTo the birds fanned by fire,\nTo Jawa the settled country,\nTo the pebbly shallows of inland waters,\nTo the hill of burning fire,\nTo the end of Lalang hill of Hades. (1)\n\nSo now we have nothing to hurt us, nothing wrong;\nWe are in health, we are in comfort;\nWe are long-lived and strong-lived,\nHard as stone, hard of head;\nLong as the waters, long of life.\nLike the waters of Ini Inda,(2)\nLike the stones of the Dewata,(2)\nLike a pool five (fathoms) deep;\nLike a stretch of river beyond eyeshot,\nLike the land turtle's burrowed bed,\nLike the waterfall of Telanjing Dara,(3)\nLike the land of Pulang Gana(4)\nLike the cave bed of Raja Sua(5)\nLike hills fixed by the gods.\nLike the moon at its full,\nLike the cluster of three stars;\nAs high as heaven, as high as the firmament.\n\nThere is nothing wrong, nothing to hurt;\nWhen sleeping have dreams of strings of fish;\nLying down, dream of bathing in the shallow pebbly streams;\n\n(1) There are added here the names of many supposed places in Hades to which the evil spirits of disease are called upon to retreat with all speed; but they are untranslateable.\n(2) Names or titles used of deities in general.\n(3) Telanjing Dara is said to be a female mythical spirit who lives at a waterfall, and who is ever on to watch to take people away to the land of death.\n(4) Pulang Gana is the spirit who presides over the land and cultivation.\n(5) Raja Sua is the spirit who presides over rivers.\nWhen dosing, dream of a branch of *rambutans*;\nDream of *langsats*, squeezed in the hand;\nDream of Ini Impong inclosing you in a *pelawan* jar;\nDream of Ini Sayoh keeping you safe for ever;\nDream of living in the heart of the moon;\nDream of gazing up into the heights above;\nDream of the summit of the eternal Rabong.\n\nThis invocation of good dreams ends the ceremony, and is supposed to complete the cure.\n\nThe foregoing is a general account of all \"pelian,\" or Manang performances; but they distinguish different kinds according to the fancy of the Manang, the violence of the disease, and the ability of the patient to pay. These are marked by special ceremonies over and above the general course of invocations song and enchantment which are common to all. The \"pelian\" then is divided into the following:\n\n1. \"Betepas,\" \"Sweeping.\" At the time of the birth of each individual on earth, a flower is supposed to grow up in Hades, and to live a life parallel to that of the man. If the flower continues to grow well, the man enjoys good robust health; if it droops, the man droops; so whenever the man has unpleasant dreams, or feels unwell two or three consecutive days, the flower in Hades is said to be in a bad condition, the Manang is called in to weed, cleanse and sweep round it; and so set the compound earthly and unearthly life on its right course again. This is the first, the lowest and the cheapest function of the Manang. In this he does not \"catch the soul,\" as is done in all others.\n\n2. \"Berua,\" \"Swinging.\" The Manang sits in a swing, and rocks himself with the idea of knocking and driving away the disease.\n\n3. \"Berenchah,\" \"Making a rush.\" The door between the private room and the open verandah of the house is thrown open, and the Manangs march backwards and forwards from room and verandah beating together a pair of swords, which is interpreted as making a grand charge into the midst of the evil spirits, and scattering them right to left.\n\n4. \"Betanam Pentik,\" \"Planting a Pentik.\" A \"Pentik,\"\nis a piece of wood very roughly carved into the figure of a man, a sort of rude doll, which is stuck into the ground at the foot of the ladder of the house with the object of divining the fate of the sick man. It is inserted into the ground in the evening; and if it remains till the morning in a straight position, well and good, recovery is certain; but if it be inclined either to the right or left, it is an omen of death.\n\n5. \"Bepancha,\" \"Making a Pancna.\" A \"Pancha\" is a swing erected on the \"tanju,\" or platform in front of the house, and the Manang swings in it, as in \"Berua,\" to express the action of \"kicking away\" the malady. An offering to the spirits is laid on the platform.\n\n6. \"Ngelembayan,\" \"Taking a long sight.\" A number of planks are laid about the verandah, and the Manangs walk upon them chanting their incantations; and when in the pretended swoon, one is supposed to sail away over rivers and seas to find the soul and recover it.\n\n7. \"Bebayak,\" \"Making a Bayak,\" i.e., an iguana. Some cooked rice is moulded into the shape of an iguana which is covered over with cloths. The iguana, or perhaps his congener the alligator, is supposed to eat up the evil spirits which cause the disease.\n\n8. \"Memuai ka Sabayan,\" \"Making a journey to Hades.\" The Manangs with hats on their heads march in procession up and down the house, during which their spirits are supposed to speed away to Hades, and bring back all kinds of medicinal charms, and talismans of health, as well as the wandering and diseased soul. At daylight they go into the jungle to \"catch the soul.\"\n\n9. \"Betiang Garong,\" \"Making a post of or for the Manes.\" A swing is constructed on the roof-ridge of the house, and the Manang performs his swinging there. An offering is also made on the ridge.\n\n10. \"Munoh Antu,\" \"Killing the Demon.\" Occasionally the Manangs will declare, of some unusual and obstinate disease, that an evil spirit called \"Buyu\" is the cause of it, and must be killed. A goodly number of them is called together, and the feat is performed in this way. The patient is taken out of the room, and laid on the verandah, and covered\nwith a net; the Manangs walk in procession up and down the whole length of the house, chanting their incantations to entice the demon within the charmed circle of their magical influence. This occupies some time, for the spirit may be far away on a journey, or fishing, or hunting; and at intervals one of them peeps in at the door to see if he has arrived. In due time the demon is there, and then the Manangs themselves enter the room, which is quite dark. Presently sounds of scuffling, of clashing of weapons, and of shouting, are heard by the Dyaks outside, and soon after the door is opened, and the demon said to be dead. He was cheated into coming to plague his victim as usual, and lo, instead of the sick and helpless patient, he encounters the crafty and mighty Manangs, who have killed him; and as proof of the reality of the deed, lights are brought, and the Manangs point out spots of blood about the floor, and occasionally the corpse itself is shewn in the shape of a dead monkey, or mayas. The trick is a very shallow one, and is managed thus: some time in the day, the Manangs procure blood from a fowl, or other animal, or may be from their own bodies, mix it with water in a bambu to prevent congealing, smuggle it into the room, and scatter it on the floor in the dark, which they can safely do in the absence of all witnesses of the proceeding. Neither lights nor outsiders are permitted in the room, on the plea that, under such circumstances, the demon would not be enticed to enter. The trick has often been detected, and the performer openly accused of imposture, and the result is that it is not now practised so often as in former times. When this feat of ghostly warfare is over, the \"pelian\" is proceeded with in the usual way till the morning hours.\n\n11. \"Beburong Raya,\" \"Making, or doing the Adjutant Bird.\" The distinctive mark of this is the procession round and round the house, the Manangs being covered with native cloths like cloaks, in which, I suppose, they profess to personate the bird.\n\n12. \"Bebandong Api,\" \"Displaying fire.\" The patient is laid on the verandah, and several small fires made round him. The Manangs pretend to dissect his body, and fan the flames towards him to drive away the sickness.\n13. \"Ninting Lanjan.\" Two swings are constructed along the whole length of the house, and the swinging farce is gone through in another form.\n\n11. \"Begiling Lantai,\" \"Wrapping with Lantai,\" or floor laths. One of the Manangs personates a dead man. He is vested with every article of Dyak dress and ornament, and lays himself down as dead, is then bound up in mats, and wrapped up with slender bambu laths tied together with rotans, and taken out of the house, and laid on the ground. He is supposed to be dead. After about an hour, the other Manangs loose him, and bring him to life; and as he recovers, so the sick person is supposed to recover.\n\nThese comprise the range of Dyak medical magic. The Betepas, the Berua, Berenchah, Betanam Pentik, are the forms most commonly used: the Bepancha, Betiang Garong and Munoh Antu are rarely resorted to; and the others hardly ever heard of now; but altogether they form an ascending scale of \"pelian\" functions rising in pretended medicinal virtue from the Betepas to Begiling Lantai; and they demand a corresponding scale of increasing fees, which are paid over to the Manang on the spot as soon as the performance is over.\n\nTo qualify the practitioner to work this system of mixed symbolism and deceit, an act of public initiation is necessary. The aspirant for the office must first commit to memory a sufficient amount of traditional lore to take a share in the incantations in company with older Manangs; but before he can accomplish the more important parts, or catch the soul, in other words, do the more audacious tricks, he must be initiated by one or more of the following ceremonies:\n\nThe first is \"Besudi,\" which seems to mean feeling, touching. The neophyte sits in the verandah as a sick man would, and the other Manangs \"belian\" over him the whole night. By this he is supposed to become endowed with the power of touch to enable him to feel where and what are the maladies of the body, and so apply the requisite charms. It is the lowest grade of Manang, and obtainable by the cheapest fees.\nThe second is \"Bekliti,\" or \"Opening.\" A whole night's incantation is gone through, as in all \"pelians,\" and in the morning the great function of initiation is carried out. The Manangs lead the neophyte into a private apartment curtained off from public gaze by long pieces of native woven cloth; and there, as they assert, they cut his head open, take out his brains, wash and restore them, to give him a clear mind to penetrate into the mysteries of evil spirits, and the intricacies of disease; they insert gold dust into his eyes to give him keenness and strength of sight powerful enough to see the soul wherever it may have wandered; they plant barbed hooks on the tips of his fingers to enable him to seize the soul and hold it fast; and lastly they pierce his heart with an arrow to make him tender-hearted, and full of sympathy with the sick and suffering. In reality, a few symbolic actions representing these operations are all that is done. A coco-nut shell, for instance, is laid upon the head and split open instead of the head itself, &c. The man is now a fully qualified practitioner, competent to practice all parts of his deceitful craft. He is now no longer an \"Iban,\" a name by which all Dyaks speak of themselves, he is a \"Manang.\" He is lifted into a different rank of being. And when engaged in their functions, they make a point of emphasizing this distinction by constant use of the two words in contrast to each other.\n\nA third grade of Manang rank is obtainable by the ambitious who have the will and means to make the outlay: they may become \"Manang bangun, Manang enjun,\" \"Manangs, 'waved upon, Manangs trampled on.'\" As in other cases, this involves a night's \"pelian,\" but the specialities conferring this M.D. of Dyak quackery and imposture are three. At the beginning of the performance, the Manangs march round and round the aspirant for the higher honour, and wave about and over him bunches of the pinang flower, an action which, all over Borneo I believe, is considered of great medicinal and benedictional value in this and many other similar connections. This is the \"Bangun.\" Then in the middle of the verandah a tall jar is placed having a short ladder fastened on either side of it, and connected at the top. At various intervals\nduring the night the Manangs, leading the new candidate, march him up one ladder and down the other; but what that action is supposed to symbolize, or what special virtue to confer, I have not been able to discover. To wind up this play at mysteries, the man lays himself flat on the floor, and the Manangs walk over him, and trample upon him, to knock into him, perhaps, all the Manang power which is to be obtained. This is the \"Enjun.\" It is regarded as a certificate of medical superiority, and the Manang who has passed the ordeal will on occasions boast that he is no ordinary spirit-controller and soul-catcher, but a \"Manang bangun, Manang enjun.\"\n\nWomen as well as men may become Manangs. In former times, I believe, all Manangs on their initiation assumed female attire for the rest of their lives; but it is rarely adopted now, at least on the coast districts; and I have only met with one such. If you ask the reason of this strange custom, the only answer forthcoming is, that the spirits or deities who first taught Dyaks the knowledge of the powers of Manangism, gave them an injunction to assume the woman's garb. It will be observed that most of the beings mentioned or invoked by Manangs are addressed as \"Ini,\" \"Grandmother,\" which perhaps implies that all the special deities of the Manang world are supposed to be of the female sex, and, to be consistent with this belief, it might have been deemed necessary for the Manang to assume the outward figure and the dress of his goddess.\n\nThe Malays also have their Manangs, who are called \"Bayoh,\" while the ceremony is \"Berasik;\" but I believe the better instructed Mahometans consider the practice of it altogether inconsistent with the true religion of Islam.\n\nIt has been said that the Pawang and the Poyang of the Malay Peninsula, and the Datus and Si Bassos of the Battaks of Sumatra, and the medicinemen of Borneo, are all offsprings and ramifications of the Shaman priests, the wizard physician of Central Asia. The Manang of the Dyaks certainly contributes his share to the proof of the assertion. A main point\nof the Shamanistic creed appears to have been that every object and force in nature has its \"spirit,\" which could be invoked by the worshipper to confer things either good or bad. This entirely corresponds with Dyak religion; the Manang, in certain of his functions, calls upon the spirits of the sun and moon, the spirits in heaven and earth, spirits in trees, hills, forests, lowlands, and rivers, to come to his aid; and if they are not equal to the \"300 spirits of heaven, and 600 spirits of the earth\" of Shamanism, they are a goodly company which the Manang professes to bring from all quarters to the house of his patient. Again, the Shaman priest on particular occasions worked himself into an ecstasy; the Manang runs round and round, and pretends to fall in a faint, at which time his greatest power is exercised. And then the seat of the Shaman deities was placed on \"the summit of the mountains of the moon,\" the central pivot of the earth; the special deities of the Manangs, as before mentioned, dwell on Rabong and Sintong, Mountains in Central Borneo; and when waving the sacrificial fowl, the last and best wish the Manang expresses for his patient is that he may have \"dreams of Rabong and dreams of Sintong.\"\n\nBut in these days, in practice, the Manang answers to the idea of the Doctor, rather than to that of the Priest; for his presence is not necessarily required for any purposes except that of treating the sick. At certain great religious functions of the Dyaks, such as the sacrifice of propitiation to the earth deities for a good harvest, or the greatest of all Dyak celebrations, the sacrificial festival to Singalang Burong, or at marriages, he is not of necessity the officiant. He may possibly be; but not because he is a Manang, but because he has given his attention to that part of ancient Dyak customs, or because he has the credit of being a lucky man. Generally, other Dyaks are the ministers of the office on these occasions; the one requisite qualification being ability to chant the traditional story and invocations which accompany the offering and ceremonies. On the other hand, the fact that at his initiation he obtains a new generic name, and is believed to enter into a new rank of being, looks like the idea of succession to an ancient priesthood.\n\nJ. PERHAM.\nEXPLORING EXPEDITION\n\nFROM\n\nSELAMA, P\u00c9RAK,\n\nOVER THE MOUNTAINS\n\nTO\n\nPONG, PATANI,\n\nIN NOVEMBER, 1883.\n\nSir Hugh Low, K.C.M.G., the Resident of P\u00e9raK, having requested me (then Magistrate and Collector in charge of Selama) to try and discover if a route could be found from Selama to Pong, Patani, with a view of making a road, if feasible, to tap this disputed territory should the pending negotiations with Siam lead to its restoration to P\u00e9raK, I got together about thirty Patani Malays, settlers in Hulu Selama, under their Penghulu Mahomed Dahari,* and some semi-civilised Semangs (a wild tribe of the Peninsula), and started on a journey through the jungle, pathless but for wild elephant and rhinoceros tracks, and quite unknown to all but Bunga, the Semang, who had but a vague recollection of coming through from Pong thirteen years before! The following\u2014my official journal of the expedition\u2014may not perhaps be without interest.\n\nARTHUR T. DEW.\n\n*The man of that name mentioned in Mr. Maxwell's Journal in 1876. See Journal, Straits Branch Royal Asiatic Society, No. 9, p. 11.\n13th November.\u2014Took bearings from front garden of Magistrate's quarters, Selama:\n\nBukit Tengas (Kedah), ... 345\u00b0 15'\nGunong Inas (highest point), ... 38\u00b0\nEastern highest peak on chain of Gunong Inas, ... 95\u00b0 15'\n\n14th November.\u2014Left at 8 A.M. on foot for Hulu Selama, 10 miles. Arrived at Hulu Selama 11.30 A.M. Gave out advances to men engaged for expedition to P\u014dng.\n\n15th November.\u2014Started from the balei at 10 A.M., wading through paddy fields. Crossed the Selama River, and arrived at Talib's house on Sungei Anak Tapa at 11.30 A.M.\n\nBearings:\u2014Kampong L\u00fabok Buaya, ... 160\u00b0\nHot springs close by, ... 170\u00b0\n\nSome of the men behind getting rice. Were joined here by two Semangs.\n\nStarted at 1 P.M. along path leading to Bukit Bintang.\n\nCrossed the Sungei Rambutan several times\u2014the path is often in its bed\u2014water running right to left. Stopped at 3 P.M. in very heavy rain on banks of Sungei Rambutan, and commenced building camp, all hands shivering with cold and wet; leeches abundant; streams very much swollen by the rain; at one time it looked as if our camping ground would be flooded.\n\n16th November.\u2014It rained all night; started at 8.30 A.M. and went up a spur of the chain of Gunong Inas, called Hulu Rambutan, as the stream of that name rises here.\n\nWent up to a height of about 400 feet; stopped at a point where three animal paths meet. Remains of old hut, tree marked with cross. We have steered about West so far. One path bearing East leads to Bukit Bintang, about a day's march distant, to where P\u011bngh\u00falu Mahomed Dahari's old abandoned tin mine is. The other path, bearing away to the North, is the one we are about to take. Can hear Krian River roaring below to westward. Crossed the Krian River four times; big boulders, depth up to armpits; most uncomfortably swift. After ascending and descending a very steep spur, crossed the Sungei Bintang at 12.15 just above its confluence with the Krian River.\nCrossed the Krian River three times again, and halted at 2 P.M. beside it, and set to building camp. Joined here by two other Semangs who should have started with us. One of them\u2014named BUNGA\u2014is a Pong Semang and came to Selama this way thirteen years ago, but has never been along it since. He is the only man to be found who has ever been at Pong, and he says he is sure he will be able to guide us there. He says we follow the Krian River, crossing and re-crossing as to-day up to its source in Gunong Inas.\n\nWe then go over the hill and eventually get to Sungei Rui, which we follow down to Pong, of course, cutting off corners. After to-night, he says, it will take us three more nights to reach Pong. Gunong Inas is said to bear from here, Camp No. 2, about N.N.E., Gunong Bintang E.S.E.\n\n17th November.\u2014Broke camp at 8 A.M.; crossed the Krian River fourteen times; water much shallower to-day, and the stream much narrower. Our path is now a rhinoceros track; marks of these animals quite fresh. After halting at midday, crossed Krian River eight times. Lost the path two or three times at a hot spring; a rhinoceros had evidently been just scared away from it, as the water was muddy. The water as it comes out from the rock (a sort of cave) is white and thick; tasted it, but it seemed quite tasteless. Remains of an old hut here, on top of a rock, where some Hulu Selama men once came to shoot rhinoceros. Halted at 2 P.M. at foot of a spur of Gunong Inas, on Krian River, which is a mere mountain torrent here, a series of cascades, about 6 feet wide, big rocks. Built camp.\n\nWe are encamped at the foot of a spur of Titi Wangsa, which we shall ascend to-morrow in a northerly direction. We have travelled, so far, in an easterly direction, passing to eastward of Gunong Inas. Gunong Inas bears from here due South.\n\n18th November.\u2014It rained for three or four hours last night; hut pretty leaky. Very cold here all night.\n\nStarted at 8 A.M. and went up the steep side of a spur of Titi Wangsa; on reaching the ridge followed the ridge line, steering about North; this ridge at one narrow point, 6 feet broad, had a precipice of 100 feet on each side. 9.30 A.M.\n\u2014Took bearings:\u2014\n\nBukit Tengas (Kedah), S.W.\nGunong Inas (highest point), 105\u00b0\n\n10 A.M.\u2014Titi Wangsa, highest point N.N.E., quite close; rocky cliffs and precipices; patches of grass.\n\n10.30 A.M.\u2014Came in view of a gap between Gunong Inas and Titi Wangsa bearing N.N.E. about 6 or 8 miles distant. The Semang, BUNGA, says we pass through that gap. We steer for it accordingly.\n\n11 A.M.\u2014Crossed a small stream, feeder of Krian River; water running left to right.\n\n12.\u2014Stopped beside Krian River. It is only a little brook here, 6 feet wide; water running left to right.\n\nOn starting again followed main wild elephant track, which leads through the pass, but, avoiding a large number of fallen trees, lost it; went up a steep hill, along its ridge, a good way, and down the other side. Stopped at 3 P.M. in heavy rain at a small stream at bottom of hill; water running left to right. Built camp. Elephant tracks abundant to-day. Had a great deal of unnecessary hard work, ascending and descending steep hills, through losing the way.\n\n19th November.\u2014Started at 8.30 A.M., about due East up a very steep hill, a spur of Titi Wangsa. No track; cutting our way; went on till we reached the ridge at about 1,500 feet elevation, and there struck the main wild-elephant track, which we lost yesterday afternoon, running N. and S. Followed along the ridge, down hill North for two hours; fresh elephant tracks all the way. I think one of the elephants was going on in front of us. At noon reached the foot of the ridge, where we crossed the Sungei Krong, running right to left. Followed the main elephant track, down this river, crossing and re-crossing it eight times. This stream is very swift and rocky, about twenty feet wide, but not very deep; there are numerous waterfalls; one crossing-place was just above a fall, and a slip would have been dangerous. This stream runs into the Rui. We follow it down all the way, and hope, with luck, to reach Sungei Rui to-morrow. During the afternoon, the Semang, BUNGA, being behind, we thought we could pilot ourselves, at least the P\u011bngh\u00falu did, with the result\nthat quite unnecessarily we went up a very steep hill; lost all tracks; wandered about and finally fetched the bottom again, and the river. We lost about two hours by this man\u0153uvre.\n\nIt rained hard all day from 10 A.M. until 5 P.M.\n\nStopped to camp at 3.15 P.M. beside Sungei Krong, in heavy rain. Some of the men have run out of provisions. It will be banyan day with them till we reach Pong, which we shall not do until the day after to-morrow.\n\nAbout 8 P.M. two big bamboos fell right on my hut, coming down with great force; although a most fragile \"lean to,\" strange to say, no damage was done.\n\n20th November.\u2014Started at 8.30 A.M. and followed downstream (Sungei Krong) steering a little East of North, the path crossing and re-crossing it. At 10 A.M. came to an old abandoned Malay camp beside the river. First sign of human beings for some days. At 11 A.M. arrived at Sungei Rui where the Krong runs into it, having crossed the Krong this morning 11 times; shot a snake in a bush, about 6 feet long and as big round as my wrist; the Semangs were afraid to pass it as they said it was dangerous. The Rui here is about 60 feet wide and not deep; swift current; roundstones at bottom, big rocks hardly any. Crossed it, and soon after, the Semangs discovering some wild fruit trees, and the track being here very well defined, I left them and most of the men behind to feast on fruit (none of them having had more than a mouthful or two of rice to-day), and pushed on with the Penghulu for the hot spring, Sira Tye, which is on our track, in hopes of getting a shot at a rhinoceros or elephant before the men came up. Arrived at Sira Tye at 1.15 P.M., but no animals were to be seen, unfortunately, though marks were plentiful. This spot is all rock; the Rui has a fall here of about 15 feet; Sira Tye bubbles up out of the rock close to the mouth of a small stream running into the Rui. It is tolerably hot where the water bubbles up; the stone is worn quite smooth, from animals continually licking at it. I tasted the water, but failed to see what the animals can like about it; it has a strong sulphureous taste. The hot spring I tasted at Hulu Krian the other day was (to me) quite tasteless and was not nearly so warm. There are the remains\nof a little hut up in a tree here, made long ago by one of the men of our party, who wanted to shoot a rhinoceros from it. He came from Kupang, Kedah. From here a good elephant and buffalo track leads off to the N. E. to Kenering, Hulu P\u00e9raK. This is one of the main Kedah-P\u00e9raK jungle roads. Started again at 1.45 p.m.; our path a little East of North. Crossed the Rui 12 times altogether to-day. Stopped to camp beside Sungei Rui at 2.30 p.m. It was along this road (the Penghulu says) that Sultan ISMAIL escaped into Kedah territory in 1875, going to Kupang.* Leeches very bad to-day. Got our camp built before the rain came on.\n\n21st November.\u2014The Semang, BUNGA, says we are sure to reach Pong by midday to-day. Started at 8 A.M. and followed the buffalo track (P\u00e9raK-Kedah) for about half-an-hour. Then we crossed a small stream, water running left to right. Here we left the big path which trends away a little to the West of North, and goes to Siah, Kedah. We went about N. by E. along animal tracks, following close to Sungei Rui.\n\n10 A.M.\u2014Passed the sulphur spring, Sira Buluh, on side of Sungei Rui, there was too much water to distinguish the sulphur spring, but the smell of sulphur was plain. Went up the steep side of a hill and on to its ridge; then the Semang, BUNGA, found we were going wrong. Struck off again keeping near Sungei Rui, crossing and re-crossing it four or five times. This river is now getting uncomfortably deep for fording and is very swift; passed an old abandoned Siamese hut on the bank; afterwards lost all track; kept on finding one, losing it again. Followed the river; men had been along there at some time, judging by cuts on trees, probably after fish. Came to a track cut at right-angles to the river up a steep and slippery hill; went up it; when on top rain came down in torrents; followed track and lost it; tried several directions, and at last got on a well-defined one; followed it nearly an hour, when we found we had come back to a spot we were at in the morning. We must have gone round nearly a circle. The Semang seems to have got bewildered when we\n\n* After the murder of the first British Resident of P\u00e9raK, Mr. Birch, and during the war which followed.\nlost the sun, and I had neglected to look at my compass. Stopped at 3.30 P.M. in pouring rain by a small stream, a feeder of Sungei Rui, (Sungei Rui quite close), and set to building camp; men much dispirited. We were sure to reach Pong at midday to-day according to BUNGA; the men have had hardly anything at all to eat for the last two days; rice has been doled out to them half a handful each; they finished the last grain this morning; my own rice all finished; shall finish my last bit of fowl to-night; nothing else left; my things all wet, the rain has found its way into my water-proof bundle; my two Klings look rather unhappy at having to try starvation for a bit, I fancy they have helped themselves pretty freely to my provisions hitherto. Leeches very thick to-day, reminding one of Ceylon.\n\n22nd November.\u2014The men were anxious to turn back to the road leading to Siah, Kedah, which we left yesterday morning, and make for that place. By doing this we should have made a certainty of getting food within about two more days, whilst by going on in this manner in an unknown jungle, food might remain an uncertainty for some days longer. However, BUNGA stuck to the truth of his statement of yesterday morning that we were then within half a day of Pong, and, as I was sure that yesterday we had gone a good distance in the right direction before we went round in a circle, I determined to push on, and the P\u011bngh\u00falu seemed to think it was the wisest thing to do. Should we get too weak to walk any further, we must make rafts and chance being smashed by waterfalls in the Sungei Rui.\n\n23rd November.\u2014Started at 8 A.M. due North up a small stream, feeder of Sungei Rui, up a steep bit of hill, and got on the ridge where we lost our way yesterday; followed it along North, descended at the end of it, and at 9.30 A.M. crossed the Sungei Sam-Sam, which BUNGA at once recognised; water running left to right; it is a feeder of Sungei Rui; remains of loose stones built up for fish-trap; ascended the opposite ridge, freshly cut marks on trees all along; this was encouraging. At 11 A.M. found we had evidently lost the right track; guessed we had gone astray where several big trees had fallen across the path; went back there about 1\u00bd miles up hill, and pick-\ned up track again. It now leads off to the eastward; followed it along and descended the steep end of the ridge; at bottom found jungle was secondary growth and had previously been cultivated, and we now knew we were near Pong and food.\n\nA little further on, at 1 P.M., reached Sungei Rui again. Three of the men who were quite done up, set to work to make a bamboo raft to descend the river on, the remainder of us followed the stream through secondary growth; past several fallen houses and abandoned gardens. In one of these there were a few sticks of sugar-cane and some green unripe plantains, we all went at these like a pack of wolves in a sheep-fold. Some had not eaten anything for three days and were nearly exhausted. This revived every one considerably, and we went on, following the river down, crossed it, and arrived at Pong at 2.30 P.M.\n\nFound rice plentiful here, twelve cents per gantang; fowls half-grown three cents, large ones nine cents each. This is a small kampong of six houses, Siamese; there were formerly twenty, but the Raja of Patani took all the people away to work for him for nothing, in a distant place, and many never came back again; Klian Pong, a tin mine on the Sungei Pong, is a short distance from here, but it is not worked now. There were formerly five hundred Chinese there, but the Raja wanted all the profit for himself, so it was abandoned.\n\nThe nearest mine at work is Klian Intan; Klian Kladie is on the Sungei Krong not far below Sira Tye. I am informed there used to be an elephant track from here to it. It has long been abandoned. It drew supplies from Baling. There is a high perpendicular rock here called Batu Chigar about 300 feet high, lime-stone, it looks as if half the hill had been split from it, it faces the river.\n\nWe put up at the Siamese Temple; sandflies in myriads at night, and drove me to bed at 7 P.M.\n\nI should have liked to have taken a day's rest, as the men had had rather a rough time of it, and we should have liked a day to get our clothes dry, having got no sun in the jungle for eight days, but I thought that our long absence might cause anxiety, so resolved to push on. Going back over the\nsame ground was not to be thought of as we had had quite enough of it.\n\nThere was formerly a path from Pong to Siah, Kedah, one day's march, but it has been long disused, and we could get no one who could show us the way with certainty. We should have gone from here to Siah about N.W., thence to Kupang, Bakar, Sedin and Mahang, and not going to Baling at all, thus saving a day.\n\nThe only well-known route is via Klian Intan, Baling, Kupang, Bakar, Sedin and Mahang; this I resolved to take. Started at 9.30 A.M. with Siamese guide. Crossed the Sungei Pong twice. Steered about North keeping alongside of Sungei Rui, following it down; crossed it twice. The first time it being rather deep, the Penghulu, another man and myself tried going over on a rakit (raft) that was moored to a tree, but when in mid-stream it capsized, and we all had a refreshing trip to the bottom. At about 10.30 A.M. four men came up with us having been despatched from Hulu Selama with a letter from Mr. Brewster asking me to try and be down at Parit Buntar, Krian, on the 22nd. They had followed our track the whole way, and had done the journey in four nights; very fair work. We steered between N. and E., our path chiefly along streams and ridges; only two or three bits of hill; these streams are simply a mass of tin, and all the stone is a fine, black, slaty-looking substance that I should think was full of it. The path was a pleasant contrast to what we have been accustomed to for the last week, and we went along at a great pace. At 2.20 P.M. struck the main Perak-Kedah-Patani buffalo track; followed it along and at 2.50 P.M. arrived at Klian Kalik.* Rested here awhile, while a heavy storm of rain came on. This is a kongsi of about thirty or forty Hokkien Chinese, who have only been here a short time. They were very civil. There are a great number of old abandoned tin workings here, chiefly the work of Malays, and the jungle is full of magnificent great durian trees; there must have been a large settlement here once. At 4 P.M. the\n\n*Klian Kalik and Klian Jntan were visited by Mr. Maxwell in 1876. See Journal, Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 9, p. 55.\nrain being over, started for Klian Intan; went up a steep little bit of hill, down the other side, and we arrived at Klian Intan at 5 P.M., and were well received by the towkay. There are about one hundred Chinese here, Macaos and Hylams, all under one towkay, and the mines here have been worked a long time. The towkay was very hospitable, and made me very comfortable, and was very anxious to know when the country was coming under the P\u00e9arak Government.\n\n24th November.\u2014Started at 9 A.M. for Baling along the path by which the tin is carried to Baling. Men get fifty cents per half pikul for carrying it. Path bears about N.W.; crossed two steep hills, and arrived at a lake in the jungle at 11.45; the part visible being about two hundred acres in extent. A very pretty spot, this is about half way between Klian Intan and Baling and there is a hut here which serves as a resting place for the tin carriers. There is no stream running into this lake, and it is said that in the wet weather the water in it is comparatively low, while in the dry weather the water comes up to where the hut stands, a rise of about four or five feet. This sounds like a traveller's yarn, but some of my men declared they have seen it. There is also said to be an enormous water-snake, ular deradai or deraday, inhabiting this lake; this reptile is said to lie in wait for animals coming down to drink, and would take a man as soon as anything else. I have heard such wonderful stories of this species of reptile, of its capabilities, &c., that I cannot help thinking that like the naga, it exists only in the fertile imagination of the Malays, especially as no one seems to know of any one who has seen one. There is a Siamese village near this, situated some distance from the lake, of about twenty houses. The village is called Bichah Deradah and the inhabitants plant padi; they have built their kampong away from the lake, which would be an excellent site, for fear of this rival of the snake. This is in Patani territory.* Lots of fish in the lake. Saw some wild-ducks. Men showing signs of having had about enough of this marching.\n\n* See Journal, Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 9, p. 31, where this lake and village are mentioned.\nWaited a long time for them to come up, most of them have bad feet. Passed some of the plantations of the Siamese villagers on the right; road going up and down; small but steep hills. Began to get into low jungle about 3 P.M.; crossed Baling River five or six times. Heavy rain came on at 3 P.M. drenching us thoroughly. Stopped a few minutes for shelter at a Siamese temple on the banks of Baling River. Went on and were joined by a Chinaman named AH SOOT, who offered to put us up at his house at Baling; he said the Resident had stopped there on his recent tour; gladly accepted his hospitable offer. Arrived at Baling* at 4.30 P.M. and took up our quarters in AH SOOT'S house, one of a row of ten or twelve brick buildings. This house is not occupied yet; so we have it all to ourselves, and thoroughly appreciate the luxury of a house once more. AH SOOT says the Resident when here told him to go and search for copper near the lake just mentioned, and to let him know the result; when I met him on the path he was just returning from there and showed me a piece of ore that looked very much like copper. He says a little distance from the lake there is a stream that flows through a cavern right underneath the hill. It was up this stream that he got the ore. He says he is going to work there for a few days longer until he is certain that he has come across plenty of it, and then he is going to take some to the Resident. He is very much afraid that the Patani people will find out what he is about, and is keeping it as dark as he can.\n\nIn front of the village here towers an almost perpendicular hill, Bukit Wang, all rocks, thickly wooded, with the rock showing out quite plainly, about 1,000 feet high, I should think. It is all limestone, and is easy of ascent along the ridge, and there are many large caves in it full of bats and therefore of guano I presume. They are a bad lot here, I have been warned by AH SOOT to be careful about opening the street door, and to have someone always watching it when open, as there are always people ready to help themselves to anything they can lay hands on.\n\n* For a description of this place in 1876, see Journal, Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 9, p. 62.\nThe river is only navigable here for native boats; can get down it to Kwala Muda in three days. The Semangs much astonished at the brick houses; none of them have ever seen one before.\n\nThe whole place has been burnt down and looted over and over again by gang-robbers. A cart-road should be made between Klian Intan and Baling, the latter place being the outlet for the tin produced at the former.\n\n25th November.\u2014MARASAT, one of the P\u011bngh\u00falu of Baling's underlings, paid me a visit this morning, the P\u011bngh\u00falu being away; I confide to his care one of my Klings, who has a bad foot and is quite unable to go any further.\n\nAs our next halting place, Kupang, was only about 4 hours' march, and the next, Bakar, too far to reach in one day, we did not leave our comfortable quarters until 10 A.M., and thus were able to get our clothes dried for the first time since leaving Selama.\n\nOur course was about S.S.W., the first hour trudging through padi fields, following the course of Baling River at foot of Bukit Wang, on east side of the hill. The curious conformation of this huge rock was very striking to-day, with its numerous cavities and indentations, the southern end overhanging in a very threatening looking manner. There are two perpendicular masses of rock at top that look like old ruined castles, and at one angle there is a rock poised on a square block that looks very much like a heavy gun. At 11 A.M. crossed Sungei Pulai, feeder of Sungei Baling; water up to our armpits; very swift and muddy, and full of holes and snags over which I nearly broke my already much lacerated shins. Waited here nearly an hour for the men to come up. They arrived at 12, and it appears that after I had gone on ahead, the sick Kling insisted on coming on too, and the others had accommodated their pace to his; sent him back again. The rain came on in torrents. Crossed several small streams; rain lasted two hours. Stopped a few minutes beside a stream for refreshment; went on, and at 2.40 P.M. crossed the Sungei Chiah, very swift indeed and up to our necks, but for a friendly stump, I should have been carried off my legs. Sungei Chiah is a tributary of the Sungei\nKupang, and the latter of the Sungei Baling. Arrived at Kupang at 3 P.M. One of Penghulu Mahomet Dahari's brothers lives here, and he placed a room of his house at our disposal. The men show signs of being nearly played out, lagging behind very much; most of them have got bad feet. This is not the weather for exploring trips, the rain has a most depressing effect on every one, and wet clothes and slushy paths make the marching tiring work. We encountered no hills to-day. There are three paths from Baling to Kupang, the one we took is the most direct and easiest. This is a kampong of about 100 houses, all the people are Patanis and they have the reputation of being a thoroughly bad lot like the Baling people. Robbery with violence is what they are most partial to. There is a farm here\u2014opium and gambling\u20146 or 7 Chinamen. The towkay told me there were formerly several Chinese shops here, but one night the Malays of the kampong looted and burnt them all out. Some were killed, and Chinese enterprise is not likely to venture here again until this miserable country becomes one of the Protected States. The men mostly have a sullen, suspicious, crafty look about them. I fully expected an attempt at robbery at night through the floor, and once felt a shaking and heard a slight noise just under my head. I had my pistol ready to salute either head or hand that should appear through the floor, but it turned out to be a cow that had got under the house. One has need though to sleep with one's ears open in this country. It rained all night; house very leaky.\n\n26th November.\u2014Did not get under way until 9 A.M.; men very tired and no go in them; wading through swamps.\n\n9.30 A.M. crossed the Kupang River, our course is about S.W. This is one of the most tiring days we have had, the road is a buffalo-path, and owing to the heavy rains these animals have churned it into slush often above the knee, and nearly always over one's boots. Crossed innumerable small streams, the path often being in their bed. Halted for refreshment at 12 beside Sungei Tawar, a feeder of the Baling, in a hut where some one had lately camped. Waited for men to come up, and went on at 10 o'clock. At 2 P.M. crossed the Sungei Dara; remains of old hut here. Two years ago, two\nmen camped in this hut; they were searching for gutta. When they were out one day a tiger killed one of them, the other man went for help, and three others came, and they brought the remains back to the hut; they all stopped there that night. That night the tiger came again and seized the other gutta searcher. The other men wounded it several times with their krisses, but did not kill it; it got away after severely wounding the man.\n\nHeavy rain came on at 2 P.M. and lasted till 3.30 P.M. Crossed a deep stream, the Si Puteh, and arrived at Bakar at 4 P.M. Men far behind; some did not come up until dark, and two men came to grief in the stream here, soaking my cartridge bag with note-book, &c., in it and nearly losing a rifle. There are about 40 houses here. Put up in the house of the son of an old white-haired man who is slightly crazy and is Peng-hulu Mahomed Dahari's grandfather. He says he opened this place originally, and that he was the first man to settle in Hulu Selama, and that his son came afterwards and opened up the place.\n\nThey are all Patanis here; went to sleep in the atmosphere of a cattle-shed; there were buffaloes stabled beneath me.\n\n27th November.\u2014Started at 8 A.M., wading through padi fields; crossed Sungei Bakar twice; it runs into the Si Puteh and that into the Sedin. Some Chinese were going down with rafts of timber of three logs each. The Sedin takes them down to Kwala Muda. Went through a lalang field called Padang Malow, and crossed a stream of the same name; water up to armpits. Passed some fine padi land all abandoned, called Padang Blam, and a stream of that name; path under water for about half a mile; this was a lively half-mile for all of us, as the water in this field was teeming with enormous horse-leeches, the first I have ever met with; they were about 6 inches long. Fine groves of durian and other fruit trees all abandoned. They say that hantu killed all the cattle and other animals, and a lot of people died too. At 1 P.M. arrived at Kampong Badan, and stopped for refreshment beside Sungei Tawar. There are fine padi fields here; eighteen houses. Went on at 2 P.M.; crossed the Sungei Badan, and arrived at Sungei Sedin at\n4 P.M. Water up to our armpits. Lucky we had no rain today, or we should have had to swim this river, baggage and all, as there are no boats here, and everything would have been soaked. Put up at the house of another of Penghulu Mahomed Dahari's brothers, at Kampong Sedin; he left Hulu Selama about two years ago. The first hour's march to-day was very bad, but afterwards the path, though a buffalo one, was much better than yesterday, and for once we got no rain. Course to-day between S. and W. There are ten houses here and few more further down the river. This river debouches at Kwala Muda; can get down in three days.\n\nMet people on the path to-day for the first time since leaving Selama.\n\n28th November.\u2014Started at 7.30 A.M. en route for Hulu Selama. Had no sooner started than a drenching shower came on. This did not much matter as regards clothes, as we always put on wet ones in the morning, keeping the dry ones for camp; but it made walking heavy work. Crossed Sungei Teruna several times, a small rocky stream. Got to top of Bukit Teruna at 9.30 A.M., a steep and slippery hill. Rain now stopped. The path the other side very bad; plain mud up to the middle, often buffalo path; crossed Sungei Dingin, a small stream, four or five times; there is an old tin mine here, Klian Dingin; the Malays came and looted the kongsi house, and it has been abandoned ever since. Crossed the Sungei Mahang three times, and stopped at noon on its bank for refreshment and for the men to come up. Went on at 1 P.M.; crossed the Krian River at 2.30 P.M.; glad to get on Selama soil again; arrived at the Hulu Krian Kampong at 3 P.M. Stopped a short time and then pushed on; met a big python in the path. For the first time during the cruise, I had let another man carry my rifle, and when I got it the snake had gone. The only time I ever went out unarmed on the Kurau Sapatang road I met a rhinoceros face to face. I made for camp, and he followed me quite half a mile; it does not do to go in the jungle unarmed. The path now got worse and worse as we got near Sungei Rambutan and past the kampung, it was terribly churned up by buffaloes and other cattle; crossed the Selama River and arrived at\nthe balei, Hulu Selama, at 5.30 P.M., just as it was getting dark, a good day's work considering the road and that we had been on the steady march without a spell off for 15 days.\n\n29th November.\u20147.30 A.M. started in boat for Kwala Selama. Delayed a good deal by fallen trees in three places; arrived about 3 P.M.\n\nARTHUR T. DEW.\n\n[In connection with Mr. Dew's paper, the following brief account of a journey on foot from Province Wellesley to Selama on the 9th and 10th October, 1874, may be of interest. Selama was then in its infancy as a mining settlement and the paths leading to it were entirely unexplored by Europeans.\u2014W. E. M.]\n\nI went to Sempang Ampat on Thursday, the 8th instant, and passed the night at the police station there in order to effect an early start on the following morning. On Friday morning I was met by five Pengh\u00falus* and about fifteen ra'iyats, who were to accompany me to Selama, and started with them and four Hindu coolies as baggage-carriers at 9 a.m.\n\nThe Kedah boundary is reached immediately on leaving Tasek Estate, which extends up to the frontier; from thence there are paths which have been made at different times by Chinese wood-cutters, by one of which I reached the foot of the range of hills which lies between Tasek and Serdang. The first two or three hours were occupied in crossing the range by a difficult path, which, in most places, was nothing but a mere track in the jungle. A succession of small hills had to be crossed (the Malays declare that there are thirty-three of them) the last and highest of which is called B\u00e9lakang\n\n* ISMAIL, Pengh\u00falu of Chero Tukun; MAT PUTEH, Pengh\u00falu of Junjong; DAUD, Pengh\u00falu of Pijangan; JAMAL, Pengh\u00falu of Chempadak; and LANANG, Pengh\u00falu of Tasek.\nParang. About half way over the range I crossed a stream called Prenggan Junjong, just above a small waterfall. This stream runs into the Tasek River. The descent after crossing the last hill is very steep, but the country on the other side is level for a long distance. After leaving the hills, the path runs through lofty forest with patches of *lalang* grass here and there, shewing where former clearings have been made, up to the Sungei Punti, a small and very winding river. The route then lay along the sandy bed of the stream which we repeatedly crossed to avoid going round all the turnings, and finally bore off towards the left to a deserted *kampung* formerly occupied by one HADI, who, with five others, was hanged at Bukit Tengah some years ago for a gang robbery and murder at Tasek village. A few fruit trees remain, but the place is rapidly relapsing into jungle. A little further on I came to the Serdang River, which runs into the Krian, a day's journey (according to my guides) from the place where I crossed it. I noticed two Malay graves on the bank of the river at this spot. A little beyond the river, the track which we had been following joins a much broader path, which runs from the village of Sungei Serdang to some tin-mines on Sungei Trap, which had lately been established by a number of Sumatra Malays (*orang rawah*), refugees from Larut. Avoiding the village of Sungei Serdang (thirty houses), which was, I was told, a considerable distance off on our right and would have been out of our way though it would have afforded shelter for the night, we followed the road to the left for some distance, and then turned off (again to the left) along a path leading to Dingin. Finding that it was impossible to reach Dingin, much less Selama, on that evening, I halted at about 3:30 p.m. on a piece of rising ground called Serdang Kudong, and camped out for the night in the jungle. On Saturday, October 10th, we started again soon after 6 a.m., and reached Sungei Trap in about half an hour. It is a larger river than the Serdang, and, like it, runs into the Krian. We followed the course of the Sungei Trap for some distance, crossing it four times to avoid making circuits. The path was a tolerably well beaten track, and the walking was easy enough, except where swamps had to be crossed. At Sungei Krising, a com-\nbination of swamp and river, I heard at 7.45 a.m. three volleys of musketry fired some distance off. I learnt afterwards at Selama that they had been fired by the Police there under the Colonial Secretary (Mr. J. W. W. BIRCH) as a salute on hoisting the British flag. The next stream which I crossed was Sungei Kasai, near which (at Sungei Buluh) there was a deserted house formerly occupied by some P\u00e9r\u00e1k Malays who had opened a tin mine here without success. Near this place we met two Malays proceeding from Dingin to Sungei Kechil, who were induced to return and guide us to Selama, as my own guides did not profess to know anything of the route beyond Dingin. After passing another swamp (Sungei Tengas River) we crossed the lower part of Bukit Tengas, the only hill on the way after leaving HADI\u2019s kampong. After descending the hill, we soon struck the Sungei Tengas, the stream of which we followed until its junction with the Sungei Dingin, which runs into the Krian. At this place there is a large clearing. Paddy was growing on recently cleared ground, and there were several houses surrounded by small plantations of Indian corn and plantains. At the junction of the two rivers, the stream was almost choked by large logs of timber ready to be made up into rafts and floated down the Dingin River to the Krian and thence to the Penang market. At a short distance beyond the Dingin River we reached the house of the Chinese wood-cutters, twelve in all, to whom the timber belonged. They had a shed full of rattans as well. Two creeks of the Krian River were next successively crossed, and at 1 p.m. we reached the Krian River itself. At this point the Malay facilities for crossing the river, which is very rapid, are some sunken logs to serve as footing and a slack rattan line fastened to trees on either side with which to steady oneself. My party were spared the necessity of testing the value of this apparatus by the timely appearance of two boats bound for Mahang (further up the river) by which we were ferried across. The place where we crossed the river was considerably above Kwala Selama (CHE KARIM\u2019s settlement), and we had a long walk through the forest, passing several houses of wood-cutters and boat-builders, to the Selama River, which we reached about 3 p.m.\nI was hospitably received at Salema by Che Karim, and met there the Colonial Secretary and the officers who had accompanied him. They had reached Selama on the previous (Friday) evening. As I ascertained from Mr. Birch that there was no prospect of any occurrence in which my services or those of my Malays were likely to be called for, I left Selama on the following morning by boat, and returned to Butterworth.\n\nThe route which I followed to Selama is not the best one. Instead of starting from Tasek, I ought to have started from Sungei Kechil near the boundary pillar on the right bank of the Krian, and so have avoided the route over the thirty-three hills. I am told that there is a good path from Sungei Kechil to Sungei Serdang; thence the route is as I have described it, but Selama would have been sooner reached if, instead of proceeding on foot from Dingin, I had gone by boat down that river to the point of its debouchure into the Krian, which is close to the Kwala Selama. The swamps and rivers are the principal obstacles to be encountered in making a good bridle-road from Sungei Kechil to Dingin, and the difficulties which they present are not serious, for I passed nothing except the Krian River which was not fordable. I saw no signs of stone suitable for road-making except in one place. After passing Sungei Trap, the present path is well defined in most places, but muddy and slippery in general and often blocked up by fallen logs. Leeches abound. I met only two parties of natives on the road in the whole distance, and I noticed fresh tracks of elephants and a tiger, showing that the road is not very much used.\n\nW. E. M.\n\nButterworth, Province Wellesley,\nOctober, 1874.\nMR. R. B. SHARPE ON BIRDS FROM P\u00c9RAK.\n\n(From the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, London, May 3rd, 1887.)\n\nOn a second collection of birds formed by Mr. L. Wray in the mountains of P\u00e9raK, Malay Peninsula. By R. Bowdler Sharpe, F.L.S., F.Z.S., &c., Zoological Department, British Museum.\n\n(Plates XXXVII & XXXVIII.)\n\nMr. L. Wray, the Curator of the P\u00e9raK Museum, has forwarded me another interesting collection of birds, amongst which are several novelties. The circumstances under which the collection was made are best explained by the following letter from Mr. Wray himself:\n\nP\u00e9raK Museum.\nP\u00e9raK, Straits, Settlements,\nNovember 15th, 1886.\n\n\"My Dear Sir,\n\n\"In accordance with the promise contained in my last letter, I now send you a collection of 51 bird-skins, which I made during a six weeks' stay on the hills in the months of September and October. Although it is not to be considered a complete collection, still, from the difficulty experienced in getting fresh species during the latter part of the time, I fancy it is a fairly representative one.\n\n\"The house in which I have been staying, and near which the collection was made, is about 4,400 feet above the sea-level, and there is only one other peak near which is higher, and that reaches to 4,700 feet. No other hills in the range, at least for many miles, rise higher than 5,600 feet. This\nrange, which is known as the Larut Range, is more or less connected on the North at the watershed of the P\u00e9rah River with the main range of the peninsula. It is covered with dense unbroken forest from base to peaks, without any elevated open or grass lands.\n\n\"Besides the birds mentioned in the list, I repeatedly heard the cry of the Argus Pheasant (*A. giganteus*), and I found their dancing-places at about 3,000 to 3,500 feet. I saw also examples of three or four species of hornbills and a green-headed bee-eater, but was not able to get specimens of them.\n\n\"Below 3,000 feet the hill forms become scarce, and the low-country ones begin to appear. The temperature at 3,300 feet on the hills ranges from about 56\u00b0 to 76\u00b0 in the shade, and at the higher stations from 50\u00b0 to 72\u00b0. Judging from the records of the past six years, there are no regular seasons in P\u00e9rah. The rainfall on the Larut hills is from 200 to 250 inches per annum.\n\n\"I am, yours truly,\n\nL. WRAY, *Junior.*\n\nMr. Wray's collection is divided into two parts, the first consisting of some low-country forms, a list of which I give for the sake of the notes appended by the collector.

On opening my window early one morning I saw one of these hawk-eagles sitting with crest erected on a stump of a tree, only about thirty yards from the house, and brought it down with a shot from my revolver. A second specimen was shot by my collector while perched on a branch of a tree quite near the ground, but was never found, as in searching for it the man got bitten on the leg by a snake (Trimeresurus gramineus), and gave up the search. These were the only two birds seen of this species.\" (Not sent.)\n\nSpilornis bacha, Sharpe, Cat. B. i., p. 290; Hume, Str. F. 1879, p. 44; Salvad. t. c., p. 173.\n\n\"No. 64. \u2640.

I found this owl seated on a branch of a small tree in a very dark ravine, and it was some time before I could decide whether it was a bird or some dead leaves.\"\n\nThis specimen is rather small, but there can scarcely be any question about its being identical with S. newarensense and not with S. Maingayi, which is the yellow-faced form found in the Malay Peninsula (cf. Hume, Str. F. vi., p. 27). As a rule S. Maingayi and S. indranee have perfectly uniform faces of a deep ochreous colour, but one specimen (\u2640) from Coonoor has the face dusky and barred with blackish, exactly as in S. newarensense, and therefore it shows either that the S. newa-\nrense occurs in the Nilghiris, or else that the latter range contains an intermediate form between S. newarenses and S. indranee.\n\nThe specimen sent by Mr. Wray has the wing 4 inches. It is evidently a very old bird, being very dark above and very coarsely barred below, with a dark band across the chest, where the cross-bars are not so distinct. The face is deep rufous-ochre, with a few indistinct blackish cross-bars. Altogether the specimen may be said to belong to the eastern race of Syrnium newarenses, with a tolerably uniform ochreous face. Such specimens are found in Formosa, Assam, Manipur and Sikkim, where a perfect gradation takes place between Syrnium newarenses, leaving it absolutely impossible to draw any line between eastern and western examples.\n\nOriolus consanguineus, Wardlaw Ramsay.\n\n\"No. 59.\u2014\u2642. Irides crimson; bill pale blue-grey. The female is black, without the red breast- and wing-spots. It is not a common bird. The range seems to be from 3,000 to 4,000 feet, but I have a specimen shot in Kinta at not more than 100 or 200 feet above the sea-level, at the foot of the central range of the peninsula.\"\n\nThe specimen sent is identical with one of the typical specimens collected by Mr. Carl Bock, and now in the British Museum.\n\nBhringa remifer (Temm.); Sharpe, Cat. B. iii., p. 257 (1877).\n\n\"No. 46.\u2014\u2642 \u2640. Irides red-brown. The long tail-feathers of most of the males have no webs on their shafts, excepting on the racket-ends, the portion covered by the ordinary tail being quite naked. I obtained two males with webs on the shafts, under the shorter tail-feathers, and was at first uncertain whether these might not be two species; but as no difference was observable in the tails of the females (the upper portion of the long tail-feathers being webbed in every specimen), it seems more probable that the bird with the webbed upper parts of the long feathers are young males.\"\n\nThis is interesting, as continuing the range of the species southward from Tenasserim, but it is also known from Java.\n\nArtamides larutensis, sp. n.\n\"No. 3c.\u2014\u2642.

Fly usually in pairs or small parties.\"\n\nA large representative of *A. larvatus*, from which it differs in its purer grey colouration, blacker chin and cheeks, and by the colour of the under tail-coverts, which are white washed with ashy grey. The under wing-coverts are also for the most part white, but in both these cases the plumage may not be fully mature.\n\nAdult male. General colour above uniform dark pearly grey, lesser wing-coverts like the back; median and greater coverts dark cindery grey, edged with pearly grey; bastard-wing, primary-coverts and quills black, fringed with ashy grey, margined with broader and paler grey on the secondaries, the innermost narrowly fringed with whitish at the ends; upper tail-coverts like the back; centre tail-feathers ashy grey, blackish towards the ends, the remainder black tipped with an ashy-grey spot, increasing in extent towards the outermost, which is also pale ashy along the outer web; crown of head like the back; a line across the base of the forehead, lores, feathers round the eye, end fore part of cheeks black; sides of face, ear-coverts, cheeks, and throat blackish, with an ashy shade, shading off paler on the lower throat and fore neck; remainder of under-surface of body deep pearly grey, a little lighter than the back; thighs dark slaty grey; under tail-coverts white, grey near the vent, the rest of the coverts marked with ashy grey; under wing-coverts grey, or grey varied with white bars; axillaries grey; quills below dusky, ashy white along the inner edge.

These fantails are restless...\"\nand active in their habits, flitting about with their tails spread out and hardly ever for a moment still. This species and the one found in the low country (*R. javanica*) are said to be mad by the Malays, from the absurd and restless way in which they are always hopping and turning about. The present species I always found in small flocks, and almost invariably with quaker thrushes (*Alcippe*), Racket-tailed drongos (*Rhinocichla mitata*) and other birds. It frequents dense jungle, and has a sweet clear little song.\u201d\n\nThe only difference between the specimen sent and others from various parts of India seems to be that the white tips to the tail-feathers are rather larger and not ashy white, but pure white. Tenasserim specimens, however, seem to be intermediate.\n\n*Niltava grandis*, Hodgs.; Sharpe, P. Z. S. 1886, p. 351.\n\u201cNo. 38.\u2014\u2642. Irides brown.

It is common above 3,500 feet, either solitary or in pairs. It hawks for insects, and also eats vegetable matter.\u201d\nThere is a slight difference between the birds of P\u00e9raK and typical *I. tickelli* from Tenasserim. The P\u00e9raK birds are rather darker, more ashy below, and decidedly more dingy olive on the flanks. These dull colours may, however, be due in great part to worn nesting-plumage, of which Mr. Wray's specimens bear evidence.\n\n*Trochalopterum peninsul\u00e6*, sp. n. (Plate xxxvii.)\n\n\"No. 25. \u2642 \u2640. Irides brown. Usually seen in the undergrowth, but sometimes on the higher trees. One pair that I shot on a fair sized tree had been feeding on some large green seeds. There were also partly digested remains of insects in both of their stomachs. This bird has a pretty clear song, and roosts low down in the under-growth.\"\n\nThis species finds its nearest ally in *T. melanostigma* of Tenasserim, resembling that species in the black wing-spot formed by the primary-coverts, but it differs in many important points, which may be summarized as follows:\n\n1. A darker chestnut crown.\n2. The back chestnut-brown instead of ashy.\n3. Ear-coverts dingy rufous brown, not ashy.\n4. Breast chestnut-brown instead of ashy.\n\nThe following is a description of the sexes of *T. peninsul\u00e6*:\n\nAdult male. General colour above reddish brown, a trifle more olivaceous towards the lower back and rump; scapulars like the back; lesser and median coverts like the back, the latter slightly washed with rufous, greater coverts maroon-red; bastard-wing black, externally golden or maroon, the outer feather olive, greenish externally; primary coverts black, forming a large patch; quills blackish, externally olive-yellow with a golden lustre, rather brighter on the primaries; inner secondaries inclining to ashy grey towards the ends, which are edged with black; upper tail-coverts like the back; tail-feathers dusky, externally golden olive; crown of head deep chestnut as far as the occiput; nape and hind neck like the back, the former slightly tinged with rufous; lores and feathers over the eye black; sides of hinder crown dark ashy, forming a patch converging on the nape; sides of face, ear-coverts and cheeks dark rufous brown, blackish below the eye and on the\nchin; throat and fore neck deep chestnut, becoming paler and more rufous-brown on the breast and abdomen; the sides of body and flanks somewhat duller brown; thighs and under tail-coverts dull rufous brown; under wing-coverts and axillaries like the sides of the breast; quills below blackish, ashy along the inner edge. Total length 10 inches, culmen 0.95, wing 4.1, tail 4.5, tarsus 1.5.\n\nAdult female. Similar to the male. Total length 10 inches, culmen 0.95, wing 3.8, tail 4.3, tarsus 1.4.\n\n*Pomatorhinus Wrayi*, sp. n.\n\n\"No. 24.\u2014\u2642 \u2640. Irides brown. This bird has a loud, clear, and rather pleasing song. It frequents the undergrowth and often the ground, going about in pairs. Stomach contained insects.\"\n\nThis species represents *P. tickelli* in the P\u00e9raK mountains, but it is everywhere much darker in plumage, the head being dusky brown, inclining to dark ashy. The tail is black instead of rufous-brown.\n\nThe following is a description of the typical pair of birds:\n\nAdult female. General colour above reddish brown, with indistinct dusky cross-bars under certain lights; lower back and rump slightly more olivaceous; upper tail-coverts again reddish brown; lesser and median coverts reddish brown like the back; greater coverts, bastard-wing, primary-coverts, and quills blackish brown, externally reddish brown, inclining to chestnut on the quills; tail-feathers blackish, washed externally with reddish brown, especially towards the base of the feathers, which are indistinctly barred with dusky under certain lights; crown of head more dusky brown than the back, and only slightly washed with rufous; lores ashy whitish; behind the eye a bare spot; no distinct eyebrow, but a streak above the ear-coverts, formed by the white longitudinal centres of the feathers, larger and more distinct down the sides of the neck; ear-coverts pale brown, followed by a reddish band down the sides of the neck; cheeks, throat, breast, and centre of abdomen white; sides of neck dusky brown, with some longitudinal white stripes intermingled; fore neck and breast with dusky margins to some of the feathers; sides of breast and of abdomen ashy grey, mottled with lanceolate\nstreaks of white, narrower on the latter; sides of body and flanks uniform reddish brown; thighs and under wing coverts and axillaries dark ashy; quills below dusky blackish, more ashy along the inner edge. Total length 10 inches, culmen 1.7, wing 4.1, tail 3.95, tarsus 1.55.\n\nAdult male.\u2014Similar to the female, but not so strongly streaked with white down the side of the neck. Total length 10 inches, culmen 1.65, wing 4.0, tarsus 1.6.\n\nI have described the female, as the male is moulting and has not got its perfect tail.\n\n*Corythocichla leucosticta*, sp. n.\n\n\"No. 37.\u2014\u2642\u2640. Irides crimson. Frequent the undergrowth usually in pairs, and has an unusually loud song for such a small bird.\"\n\nCompared with *C. striata* the present species is more ashy both above and below, and is easily distinguished by the white dots on the coverts and quills, these being fulvous in *C. striata*. The throat is distinctly mottled with blackish (not ashy) centres to the feathers.\n\nAdult male.\u2014General colour above ashy brown, with a slight ruddy tinge; all the feathers edged with black, producing a mottled appearance; rump not so distinctly mottled; wing-coverts like the back, and edged with black in the same manner, each having a tiny white spot at the tip; bastard-wing, primary coverts, and quills blackish, externally olive brown, a little more ruddy on the latter; all the quills with a tiny white spot at the end, larger on the inner secondaries; tail feathers dark brown; externally reddish brown; head like the back, and mottled with black edgings in the same manner; lores and a distinct broad eyebrow ashy grey; sides of face dull ashy, shaded with brown on the ear-coverts, and having a faint moustache of whitish near the gape; cheeks uniform ashy grey; throat white, mottled with dark ashy-grey centres to the feathers; remainder of under surface of body dull ashy brown, with dusky centres; the sides of the body brown-er, becoming more rufous on the flanks and under tail-coverts axillaries and under wing-coverts olive-brown. Total length 5.4 inches, culmen 0.7, wing 2.5, tail 1.8, tarsus 0.95.\nAdult female.\u2014Similar to the male, but rather paler in colour. Total length 5.2 inches, culmen 0.7, wing 2.55, tail 1.75, tarsus 0.9.\n\n*Siva sordida*, Hume; Sharpe, Cat. B. vii., p. 641.\n\n\"No. 33.\u2014Irides white. This hill-tit is not often seen, so far as my experience goes. During bad stormy weather it seems to disappear altogether, probably taking refuge in the sheltered valleys.\"\n\nA young bird, belonging to *S. sordida* or a closely allied species, and certainly quite distinct from *S. cyanoptera*. It has rather a long tail, and is yellower underneath than the type of *S. sordida*, and a comparison of fully adult birds is desirable.\n\n*Alcippe peracensis*, sp. n.\n\n\"No. 32.\u2014\u2642. Irides brown. This bird is common on the higher parts of the hills. It has a loud and musical song.\"\n\nBy the absence of the white eyelids this new species ought to be allied to *Alcippe phaocephala* and *A. cinerea*; but it has a very distinct black band running down the sides of the neck, thus showing its affinity to *A. nipalensis*. It is, in fact, closely allied to the latter species, but may be distinguished by the want of the white ring of feathers round the eye.\n\nAdult.\u2014General colour above warm brown from the lower mantle downwards; the upper tail-coverts like the back; wing-coverts like the back; bastard-wing, primary-coverts, and quills dusky brown, externally like the back; the primaries edged with fulvous brown; tail-feathers brown externally like the back; crown of head, occiput, nape, hind neck, and upper mantle dark slaty grey, with a black streak extending from above the eye to the upper back; lores ashy white; feathers round eye, ear-coverts, and sides of neck ashy grey, lighter on the cheeks, which incline to ashy white like the throat; fore neck, breast, and abdomen creamy white; the sides of body and flanks light brown, darkening on the latter; thighs and under tail-coverts light brown; under wing-coverts and axillaries whitish brown; quills below dusky, ashy whitish along the inner edge. Total length 5.4 inches, culmen 0.5, wing 2.5, tail 2.5, tarsus 0.75.\n\n*Minla soror*, sp. n. (Plate XXXVIII. fig., i.)\n\"No. 42. \u2642. Irides dark brown.\"\n\nClosely allied to *M. castaneiceps*, from which it differs in its much larger size, darker olive-brown colouration, and deep chestnut, not orange, edging to the quills.\n\nAdult.\u2014General colour above olive-brown, more distinctly olive on the lower back and rump; the mantle with narrow pale shaft-streaks, not very distinct; lesser and median coverts like the back; quills dusky blackish, externally olive-brown; the primaries edged with chestnut towards the base; the outer primaries margined with white; upper tail-coverts like the back; tail feathers ashy-brown, externally olive-brown; crown of head and nape bright chestnut, the feathers mesially streaked with rufous shaft-lines, white towards the forehead; lores and feathers round and below the eye sulphur-yellow; ear-coverts with a black streak along the upper part, surmounted by a streak of sulphur-yellow; remainder of ear-covert yellow streaked with black, and with a black stripe below, separating them from the cheeks, which, with the throat and under surface of body, are pale yellowish buff; the feathers of the cheeks and throat slightly mottled with brown tips; sides of body and flanks olive-brown; thighs olive-brown; under tail-coverts yellowish white, with dusky centres; under wing-coverts and axillaries pale-yellow; quills below dusky, ashy yellowish along the inner edge. Total length 4.7 inches, culmen 0.55, wing 2.6, tail 2.0, tarsus 0.85.\n\n*Stachyris nigriceps*, Hodgs.; Sharpe, Cat. B. vii., p. 532, (1883).\n\n\"No. 56. \u2642.

I have not observed it lower than 3,000 feet. There is another species of honey-sucker, but I was not able to get a specimen of it.\"\n\nThis species is the Malayan representative of *\u00c6thopyga sanguinipectus*, from which it may be distinguished by its black, non-metallic throat and fore-neck.\n\nAdult male.\u2014General colour above dark crimson on the mantle and back; scapulars black; on the rump a patch of sulphur-yellow; bastard-wing, primary-coverts and quills blackish, a little browner on the edge of the latter; upper tail-coverts metallic violet-blue; tail-feathers black, the long centre ones externally metallic violet-blue; crown of head metallic violet-blue, with a purple reflection; lores, sides of face, and ear-coverts black; cheeks metallic blue, forming a moustachial streak; throat, fore neck and chest velvety black, the sides of the latter dark crimson enclosed by black; breast abdomen, sides of body and flanks pale olive-greenish, yellower on the centre of the breast, which is also streaked with black, and just below the velvety black of the upper breast are some tiny longitudinal streaks of scarlet; on the sides of the body and flanks a tuft of pale yellow; thighs and under tail-coverts like the breast; under wing coverts and axillaries yellow, with\nwhite bases; quills below dusky blackish, white along the inner edge.

Irides white; skin round eyes white; legs and bill blue-grey. Sexes alike. This pretty little nuthatch frequents the densest parts of the jungle, usually in the ravines, and seems to prefer the trunks of the largest trees to hunt for insects, &c. Is seen singly or in small parties of three or four.\"\n\nCount Salvadori finds fault with Gray's figure of this species, and says that the feet in the dried skins from Sumatra were greenish, not yellow; but it is probable that they became yellow in time, and certainly our Java skins have yellow legs; but a Timor specimen has them dark, like the P\u00e9rah bird. Both the last-named specimens are duller blue on the back than the Java specimens.\n\n*Zosterops auriventer*, Hume; Sharpe, Cat. B. ix. p., 163.\n\n\"No. 43.\u2014\u2640.

I also found a nest belonging to the same species, which was built of twigs and contained white eggs. It was on the top of a small palm tree, about 5 feet from the ground. These two species and *Carpophaga badia* are the only representatives of the *Columb\u00e6* which I have seen in the upper parts of the mountains.\"\n\nSo far as I can see, this dove is *M. tusalia* of Hodgson; but I must confess that the variations of plumage in this genus require more time to work out than I have at present at my disposal.\nOCCASIONAL NOTES.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF CAPT. T. J. NEWBOLD,\n23RD MADRAS LIGHT INFANTRY.\n\nIn No. 3 of Notes and Queries issued with No. 16 of this Journal, information was asked for as to the life of Capt. NEWBOLD, the author of a \"Political and Statistical Account of the British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca\" (Murray, 1839). Notice was obligingly taken of this by the writer of \"Excerpta Orientalia\" in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for January, 1887 (Vol. xix, N. S., Part I, p. 171), and profiting by the reference there given, I communicated with the Editor of the Times of India published at Bombay, with the result that I have been courteously furnished with a copy of a biographical notice of the deceased officer, which appeared in the Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce on June 5th, 1850. This will not be without interest to those who have admired and profited by the industry and accuracy exhibited in NEWBOLD's work on the Straits Settlements, which, though published nearly half a century ago, and necessarily out of date in many particulars, is still a valuable work of reference.\u2014W.

The melancholy event took place at Mahabulleshwar, whither the deceased had gone for change of air, on the forenoon of the 2nd instant. Captain NEWBOLD enter-\ned the Army in 1827, and was promoted to Captain on the 10th April, 1842. He was known as an enthusiastic and indefatigable student, languages and history at this period of his career forming his favourite pursuits. In 1835 a short but promising paper, subsequently published in their Transactions, was laid by him before the Literary Society of Madras, entitled \"A Brief Notice of some of the Persian Poets.\" The next paper from his pen, to be found in the Madras Journal, is on the Genealogy of the Kings of the Mahomedan Dynasty in Achin, extracted from a Malayan manuscript\u2014it is printed in the 2nd and 3rd volumes; and this was followed by a short but learned notice, printed in the latter of these, on the language of the Batins of Sumatra, with remarks on its Hindu affinities. These papers were quite sufficient to bring our young linguist into notice, and he at this time became member both of the Bengal and Madras Societies, and was shortly after appointed A.D.C. to Brigadier-General Wilson, then Commanding at Kurnool. In 1838 an elaborate paper on the Malayan Peninsula was prepared by him for the information of General Wilson, and presented by that Officer to the Madras Society\u2014it appears in the 7th volume of their Transactions. Along with this was presented a large collection of Malayan MSS. and books, accompanied with a valuable note on their contents. In the same year he prepared for the press, and despatched to England for publication, his work on the Straits of Malacca\u2014the largest of the productions of his pen. It contains a full and elaborate account of the British Settlements in the Straits\u2014their geography, political and physical, and their civil and natural history, together with a vast variety of miscellaneous information, such as required the utmost patience, labour and care to have collected. He about this time prepared a Zoological and Botanical Catalogue for the Straits; it was printed and circulated for correction and enlargement, but was considered too incomplete for publication. In the same year Lieutenant Newbold first appears before the world as a geologist\u2014though it is quite obvious, from his papers, that the subject had long been familiar to him, and that he had attained a high degree of proficiency in the study\nof the science. A paper by him on the *reguir*, or black cotton soil of India, was in the spring of that year read by Mr. CHRISTIE before the Royal Society of London; while a very excellent account of the geology of a portion of the Deccan is to be found in \"A Description of the Valley of Sondur,\" in the heart of the Balaghat Territories, ceded to the British by the Nizam in 1800. The paper is a very elaborate one, abounding in agricultural, statistical, and commercial, as well as scientific information. This was followed in 1839 by a geographical, historical, and statistical account of the ceded districts, distinguished by the same valuable characteristics as the paper preceding it. In 1840 Captain NEWBOLD visited Europe, and was about two years absent from India. His time wherever he went was as usual devoted to those studies which from the date of his arrival in India until the hour of his demise were never for a moment interrupted. The Egyptian Desert was on this occasion minutely surveyed by him: the survey afterwards became the subject of a paper, and the travertine around Rome, and conglomerate and recent calcareous formations along the shores of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, became subjects of his special attention. Captain NEWBOLD was about this time advanced from the post of A.D.C. to General WILSON to that of Assistant Resident at Kurnool; and in 1844\u2014we are unable to trace his various contributions to the press for the five years preceding this\u2014appeared a very able article in the *Bengal Transactions*\u2014those already noticed having been published in the *Madras Journal*\u2014on a recent fresh water deposit in Southern India, with a few remarks on the origin and age of Kunkur. The origin of the vast masses of curious variety of limestone, so far as is known peculiar to India, he ascribed to the agency of thermal springs charged with lime, such as seen to have produced the travertine of Italy: that now coming into existence he considered due to the action of the rains. The matter was afterwards enlarged on by him, and he came ultimately to lean towards the latter theory as sufficient to explain the formation of Kunkur without the aid of other agency, and this view of the case seems to have been fully made out by Captain JAMES\nABBOTT of the Bengal Artillery, so that there no longer appears any mystery in connection with the origin and characteristics of this most curious formation. In 1845 three papers on the same general class of subjects were presented by him to the Bengal Asiatic Society, and printed in their Transactions\u2014entitled \"Notes, chiefly Geological, across the Peninsula of India from Madras to Goa, &c.\"\u2014while the subject was continued in four very valuable papers published the following year in the Bengal Journal, containing notes on the geology of both the eastern and western coasts; one on the formations around Hyderabad having been drawn up by him in 1847. In 1845 a series of very valuable papers by him appeared in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of London, entitled \"A Summary of the Geology of Southern India\"; and in this was comprised an outline of nearly the whole of his previous researches. The article on the Geology of India published in the Calcutta Review for 1848, is little more than an abstract of these papers, so far as the East is particularly concerned. In these papers our other peculiarly Indian formation\u2014laterite\u2014had occupied a large share of attention, as Kunkur had done before; and though much information both new and valuable was furnished by him on the subject, his arguments regarding it are less convincing, and his conclusions less clear and definite, than those attained in reference to the fresh-water limestone. To him we owe the first account that has been published of the lignite found, or said to be found, in laterite near Cochin, for we candidly confess ourselves still unsatisfied on the subject; as well as of the corundum pits in Southern India, the mineral itself having been known for nearly half a century. In 1848 he was, on the appointment of Captain Malcolm to the agency at Joudpore, nominated Assistant to General Fraser, Resident at the Court of the Nizam\u2014a situation he was unhappily not long destined to enjoy. His health now began rapidly to fail him, the symptoms being supposed pulmonary\u2014and he was recommended to try the sea coast for the benefit of air: he proceeded accordingly to Madras, and afterwards to Bombay, where he for some months resided. He visited Scinde, and made a short sojourn at\nKurrachee, and afterwards proceeded to the Persian Gulf, having spent nearly a year travelling in Arabia and Mesopotamia. He returned to Bombay in February last, considerably improved in appearance, but with no signs of the eradication of the malady which to all but himself had long appeared irremediable. He had in March forwarded his papers and collection of specimens, and other heavy baggage to Hyderabad, whither he himself proposed to follow, when he was induced to visit the Mahabuleshwar Hills. Here he spent six weeks, not apparently either gaining or losing greatly in health or strength; when he was suddenly cut off, without a pang or moment's warning, in the midst of his studies. Captain Newbold was not one of those whom sickness prostrated, or who abandoned mental exertion the moment bodily weakness or languor were induced by failing health. On the contrary, his efforts seemed only to have become more assiduous, and his mind more active, as the material frame-work which held his spirit decayed; and we question if, during any two years of his enterprising life, he performed more intellectual labour than during those with which it closed. Under a severe regimen and the most rigid medical treatment\u2014so weak as to be unable to ascend or descend twenty feet of an ordinary stair\u2014while at Kurrachee, he literally crept along the seashore, explored Minora Point with a care never before bestowed on it, and in the midst of oyster-beds, beautifully coloured clays, schists, gravels, and conglomerate, he found a fine fresh water deposit which had escaped the notice of Vicary and all other geologists. Just before leaving for the Persian Gulf, he drew up a voluminous, learned, and elaborate paper on the subject of the sites of the Cities of Ai or Hai. The paper is full of biblical research and general learning, and admirably illustrates the accuracy and minuteness of the topography of the Old Testament. During his wanderings, he contributed some valuable papers to the London Societies on ancient geography; and on his return in February, forwarded a large, valuable, and varied collection of specimens to the Bombay Asiatic Society, with an able paper on the geology of this part of Arabia, and the\ngeneral character of the Nummulite formation which occupies so vast a space betwixt the 21st and 30th parallels\u2014from Cutch to Gibraltar. He continued to the last daily engaged in studies which were his delight and solace, and when summoned hence, was found with his harness on. Captain NEWBOLD was remarkable for the patience and industry with which all his researches were conducted, and the extreme care and caution evinced by him before pronouncing any conclusion. He never took a fact for granted when it might be ascertained by enquiry, nor ever was content to say \"I do not know\" in cases where ignorance could be dispelled by exertion, and never professed knowledge he did not possess. He was not only an able and accomplished, but a singularly amiable and excellent man\u2014of great mental purity and personal worth; and no more distinguished enquirer has been removed from amongst us since the name of the illustrious JAMES PRINSEP was erased from the list of living philosophers.\"\u2014The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce, Wednesday, June 5, 1850.\n\nExtract from \"Men whom India Has Known\" by Higginbotham, p. 328.\n\nNEWBOLD, Captain, 12th M.

In continuation of that notice, we proceed to give a brief account of the more prominent papers contained in the seven quarterly parts that have been published since with unfailing punctuality. In Biography, there is a deservedly appreciative notice, by Prof. VREEDE, of the late J. J. MEINSMAN, who, like his uncle, TACO ROORDA, did so much for the study of Javanese literature. There is, further, a valuable account, by CH. M. DOZY, of ABEL JANZOOON TASMAN (\u00d7 1659), the discoverer of Australia. Lastly, Dr. C. SNOUCK HURGONJE treats of SAYYID AHMAD IBN ZENI DAHLAN, Mufti of the Shafites at Mecca, and of his historical works. In this essay a flood of light is thrown on literary life at Mecca at the present day, and on the views at\n\n* Bijdragen voor de taal-, land- en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb.\npresent entertained concerning the or a Mahdi (see also an article by the same scholar in the \"Revue Coloniale Internationale\" for January, 1886). In History, Mr. P. A. Tiele continues his account of the Europeans in the Indian Archipelago, dealing with the period between 1611 and 1623. There are also two interesting contributions, from the pen of Mr. E. B. Kielstra, to our knowledge of W. Sumatra, the one treating of its history in the middle of last century, the other confining itself to the brief period of 1819-26, when he wars of the Padris began, and the island gradually passed from the hands of the English into those of the Dutch. Ethnologists will have welcomed with special interest the various elaborate treatises by Prof. G. A. Wilken, viz., on the customs concerning betrothal and marriage among the people of the Indian Archipelago\u2014a subject on which J. B. Neumann has lately given interesting details concerning the Battaks in Sumatra; on the custom of reckoning time by nights; on ithyphallic figures and kindred subjects; on traces of Shamanism as practised in the Indian Archipelago; and on the Papuas of the Geelvink Bay of New Guinea. Prof. Pleyte, of Leiden, has supplied two papers, one on mnemonic and other marks, and another on prehistoric stone weapons and implements, while Mr. S. W. Tromp treats of the Bugi inhabitants of Kutei in Borneo. There is one paper dealing with a practical commercial question, which no one would have sought for in the \"Bijdragen,\" on coffee culture in the Brazils, by Mr. K. F. van Delden-La\u00ebrne. Lastly, we have to note a number of important articles on topics connected with language and literature. And here, in a field in which he is thoroughly at home, Dr. Snouck Hurgronje has a valuable collection of Meccan proverbs and proverbial sayings, while in another paper he corrects some current misconceptions concerning the meaning of the term Hijra and the veiling of Muhammadan women. Prof. Kern, of Leiden, who combines with a scholarly knowledge of Sanskrit an acquaintance with Old-Javanese or Kavi in its extensive literature, and is one of the leading authorities on the inter-comparison of the Malayo-Polynesian languages, has contributed an article on the phonology of that class, and another\non the Old-Javanese poem \"Jantu Panggeharan,\" which gives an account of the creation of the world. Prof. VREEDE'S criticism of Kern's work on the Fiji language contains a large number of acute observations which testify to their author's competency to enter the lists in literary controversies on this subject. Lastly, an article, by C. A. von OPHUYZEN, on the popular poetry of the Battaks, deserves favourable mention. As the Institute is engaged in a field of research, but a small portion of which has as yet been cultivated, and as the results of its work as deposited in the \"Bijdragen\" do the utmost credit to the learning of its working members, we may confidently look forward to the instructive contents of its further publications.\u2014Tr\u00fcbner's Record.\n\nThe Koninklijk Institu\u00fbt voor de taal-, land- en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Indi\u00eb have elected Mr. W. E. MAXWELL, C.M.G. (Member of the Royal Asiatic Society and late Honorary Secretary of the Straits Branch R. A. S.) as a corresponding member, in recognition of his philological studies.\n\n\"INDIAN NOTES AND QUERIES.\"\n\nNOTICE.\u2014OWING to pressure of official business, the Editor of \"Indian Notes and Queries\" is compelled reluctantly to discontinue the publication of that journal.\n\nSubscriptions already paid in advance will be refunded by the PUBLISHERS, the \"Pioneer\" Press, Allahabad.\n\nTREATY WITH JAVA.\n\nMr. NOEL TROTTER writing to a friend from Auckland, New Zealand, states:\u2014\"The original treaty dated the 23rd of De-\ncember, 1811, between the Javanese authorities and Mr. Adam on behalf of Mr. RAFFLES (as he was then), whereby the sovereignty of Java was made over to the British, is in the Museum here. Sir GEORGE GREY got possession of the Treaty at the Cape, and lately presented it to the Museum. He told me about it and said its existence is not generally known.\"\n\nMr. TROTTER writes that he also saw some Arabic or Malay documents in the Museum which probably belong to the same period.\n\nIt would be interesting to know what these other documents are.\n\nH.

Frederick Dickson, K.C.M.G., President, The Right Rev. Bishop G. F. Hose, D.D., The Hon'ble D. F. A. Hervey, The Hon'ble J. W. Bonser, Colonel S. Dunlop, C.M.G., E. Koek, Esq., H. N. Ridley, Esq., W. Davison, Esq., H. L. Noronha, Esq., W. Nanson, Esq., A. Gentle, Esq., and A. W. S. O'Sullivan, Esq., Honorary Secretary.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe Report of the Council for 1890 was read by the Honorary Secretary.\n\nThe President addressed the meeting, passing in review the work of the Society during the past year, and suggesting certain improvements for the consideration of the Society.\nThe election of members recommended by the Council was approved.\n\nThe Report, with some alterations, and the Honorary Treasurer's Statements of Account were adopted.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary tendered his resignation, which was accepted, the President expressing regret.\n\nA ballot was then taken for the officers for the present year, with the following result:\n\nCOUNCIL FOR 1890.\n\nPresident,\u2014The Hon'ble Sir J. Frederick Dickson, K.C.M.G.\n\nVice-Presidents,\u2014Singapore: The Right Rev. Bishop G. F. Hose, D.D.; Penang: D. Logan, Esq.\n\nHonorary Secretary,\u2014H. N. Ridley, Esq.\n\nHonorary Treasurer,\u2014E. Koek, Esq.\n\nCouncillors,\u2014W. Davison, Esq., H. L. Noronha, Esq., W. Nanson, Esq., The Hon'ble J. W. Bonser, A. Knight, Esq.\n\nThe following resolution was proposed by the Right Rev. Bishop Hose:\n\n\"That gentlemen residing outside Singapore and Penang be invited by the Council to be corresponding members for the several districts in which they reside, and that such corresponding members be invited to attend any meeting of the Council which may take place while they are present in Singapore.\"\n\nThe resolution was seconded by Mr. Bonser, and, after some discussion, was adopted.\n\nThe following resolution, proposed by the President and seconded by Mr. Koek, was adopted:\n\n\"That the Honorary Secretary compile for publication annually in the Journal a Bibliography of Works or Selections from Works or Journals relating to matters of scientific and\ngeneral interest in the Malay countries of the Far East, and endeavour to make or obtain for publication in a similar manner translations of such works or selections in foreign languages as may be approved of by the Council.\"\n\nThe Society's Journal for 1889 (No. 20) was laid on the table. The President expressed regret for the delay which has taken place in the publication of that Journal.\n\nIt is decided to send home the new edition of the Map, which is now all but complete, for publication without delay.\n\nThe meeting then closed.\nANNUAL REPORT\nOF THE\nCOUNCIL\nOF THE\nSTRAITS BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nFOR THE YEAR 1889.\n\nThe Council, in laying their Annual Report for 1889 before the General Meeting, are happy to be able to report a satisfactory financial state of the affairs of the Society, but desire to appeal to all its members to make renewed efforts in its behalf, both by contributing the results of their individual research for publication in the Journal, and communicating suggestions in regard to fresh fields of enquiry on subjects of local, as well as of general scientific interest.\n\nSince the last General Meeting, the following members have been elected by the Council, subject to confirmation under Rule XI by a General Meeting:\u2014H. N. Ridley, Esq., Singapore; J. O. Anthonisz, Esq., Singapore; Archibald Kennedy, Esq., Perak; C. O. Blagden, Esq., Singapore; and Lieut. Gaynor, R.E., Singapore.\n\nH. Frank, Esq., withdrew his subscription at the end of the year.\nIt is recommended by the Council that the following gentlemen should be considered to have retired from the Society:\u2014Messrs. F. POOLES, S. E. DALRYMPLE, E. P. GUERRITZ, J. R. PARSONS, F. DELONCLE, and Dr. N. B. DENNYS, Ph. D.\n\nDuring the year, one hundred and fifteen copies of the latest edition of the Map of the Malay Peninsula have been disposed of, whereby a sum of $295.49 has been placed to the credit of the Society.\n\nThe Council have much pleasure in announcing that they are now almost in a position to publish a fresh edition of the Map, embodying all the most recent surveys in Pahang, Perak, Kelantan, Jelebu, and the Negri Sembilan. A survey of a portion of the East Coast was also supplied by Capt. H. CARR, of H. M. S. Orion, which will form a valuable addition to the Map. All these surveys have now been worked up by a draughtsman, whose services for this purpose were kindly lent by the Survey Department, and the work of compilation may be expected to be complete before the end of February. It is hoped that any members who are in a position to supply further information will do so at once, so that it may be embodied in the Map before it is sent home for publication.\n\nThe Council desire to express their best thanks to all those who have contributed the results of their valuable labours towards this most useful work, thereby rendering it possible, after a lapse of only two and-a-half years since the last edition was published, to bring out a new edition of the Map, containing a large amount of fresh information in regard to localities which have hitherto remained practically unexplored.\n\nNo. 19 of the Journal was published last year, and No. 20 has just been produced. The Council much regret that, owing to unfortunate circumstances, the publication of the Journal has somewhat fallen behind. The Journal published last year (No. 19) bears the date 1887, but as it was not brought out till 1889, it will thus be seen that we are two years in arrears. The Council have thought it best, therefore,\nto omit the year 1888 altogether, and to let the present Journal (No. 20) bear the date 1889.\n\nThe Honorary Treasurer's Statement of the financial position of the Society is appended, and shows a state in this respect more satisfactory than in any previous year. There is a balance to credit of $787.95, and all liabilities have been cleared off, with the exception of the cost of the publication of the present Journal.\n\nMr. Stanford's account for lithographing the Map has been settled in full, and a balance of 25 copies still remains in his hands for sale, which may be expected to realize about \u00a310 6s. 7d.\n\nThrough the liberality of the Straits Government, a sum of $500 has again been placed on the Estimates to assist in defraying the expenses of the new edition of the Map of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nA.

For this purpose, I have here collected all the information I could, both by personal observation of the habits of these animals, and by enquiries of the several planters whose estates have been much affected, and by reference also to published notes in The Tropical Agriculturist, and in a paper published by authority of the Straits Settlements Government and written by Dr. Simon, together with the correspondence on the subject between the various planters and certain Government Officials.\n\nThe Species of Beetles.\u2014The two species of beetle which attack palms here are quite different in appearance and habits and in their method of destruction, although they are usually found together, and must be treated of separately. One is Oryctes rhinoceros, commonly known as the rhinoceros, elephant or black beetle, belonging to the group of Lamellicornia. The other is Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, known as the red beetle: it is a large species of weevil. Two other larger species of Calandra occur in the island, both of which prey on some species of palm, but I have not received any notice of their attacking coco-nuts.\n\nOryctes rhinoceros.\u2014This beetle belongs to the group of Lamellicornia, the larv\u00e6 of which live in decaying vegetable\nmatter. In the case of this species, the parent beetle deposits its eggs in the decaying stems of coco-nut trees, whether still erect or fallen to the ground. So abundant are they, that I have found as many as forty larv\u00e6, nearly all full grown, in about three feet of a rotten palm-stem. But besides this habitat, it is also stated that the larv\u00e6 occur in manure pits, cow dung, tan bark, crushed sugar-canies, and other vegetable remains, and also in mangrove mud; and I have received grubs taken from piles of cow dung and from leaf mould, made by accumulating grass leaves, &c. in a pit, which were quite indistinguishable from those taken from rotten palms. Their existence in mangrove mud seems to me incredible, as it appears highly unsuited for them. I have been unable to get grubs taken from mud, and certainly palms growing near mangrove swamps are not more liable to attack than if they were growing in drier soil. The identification of larv\u00e6 of this group is very difficult, and can only be undertaken by an entomologist, as all the grubs of the larger Lamellicorn beetles are very similar, and there are a number of harmless, and even useful, species of this group in Singapore. I have attempted to rear the grubs, but without success, as they invariably die in confinement in a few days.\n\n**Description of the Grub.**\u2014The larva is a fleshy white grub from two and a half to three inches long when full grown. The head is rounded, broad, hard and of a dark chestnut brown colour, and behind it on the next segment is an angular patch of chitine on each side. The body is swollen at the tail, so that the grub can only lie upon its side, as is usual in this class of larv\u00e6. It is covered with short, scattered bristles, most numerous along the sides just below the spiracles. The legs are about half an inch in length, weak, but chitinous, and covered with bristles. The short antenn\u00e6 are quite hairless, and the jaws are thick and powerful, black with a single tooth below the sharp cutting point.\n\n**Description of the Beetle.**\u2014The grub passes into the chrysalis state in the tree or the rubbish in which it has spent its life, merely making an oval nest in the rotten wood in which to dose. The chrysalis is large and fleshy, soft and white,\nand has the form of the perfect insect. It appears to remain but a short time in this state, for chrysalids are very rarely found. Hatched in the tree, it soon makes its way out, and eventually flies off to commence its work of destruction. The beetle varies a good deal in size, but is easily recognised. Large specimens are nearly $2\\frac{1}{4}$ inches in length and very broad, of a dark brown or black colour, the chitinous coat being exceedingly hard. The head in the male is small and provided with a blunt horn curved over towards the back, half an inch long. The thorax is about an inch long and three quarters of an inch broad, very hard and solid; it is smooth, and scooped out in front, so that it slopes towards the head. The back edge of this depression is notched, and there are two small semicircular depressions on either side of the large one. The wing cases do not cover the body completely; they are broad and oblong and raised over the back, smooth and shining, but dotted all over with minute punctures. The under side of the body is red-brown, mostly hairless, but the mouth and all the face in front of the horn is covered with red hairs. The legs are strong and stout, the second joint being armed with sharp teeth, with the aid of which the beetle can tear its way into the tree. The female insect can be distinguished by its very short horn, not a quarter of an inch long, and by the much smaller depression in the thorax, which is not notched at the back, as it is in the male, than which, too, it is usually smaller. The insects fly briskly at dusk, rather high in the air, attacking the palm trees at night.\n\nDestruction of Trees.\u2014The grub of this insect is quite harmless, and indeed rather beneficial than otherwise, as it assists to convert rotting wood and other vegetable refuse into soil. It is the perfect insect that is so destructive. Its method of attack is as follows. It flies by night to a palm, and makes its way to the base of a leaf-stalk, and burrows into the heart of the cabbage, making a large hole, from which projects a quantity of the fibre of the tree resembling tow. The appearance of a tuft of this is evidence that the beetle has been at work. It remains in the hole usually all the next day, and may be captured in the burrow. It nibbles\nin so deeply, that, not rarely, it bites through the growing point in the cabbage, or bud of the palm. More often, the attack is repeated till the rain getting into the burrows sets up decay, which rots the palm through. In either case the tree speedily dies. A tree once attacked seems to be very popular, and I have known palms from which two or three beetles a day could be taken regularly, in spite of all attempts to drive them away by the aid of carbolic acid, salt and other substances.\n\nThe following species of palm, besides the coco-nut, have been attacked, and some destroyed, in the Botanic Gardens:\u2014Cocos plumosa, Martinezia caryot\u00e6folia, Corypha gebanga, Ph\u0153nix dactylifera, Livistona chinensis, Verschaffeltia splendida, Areca rubia, Hyophorbe amaricaulis, El\u0153is guineensis Sabalum braculifera, Borassus flabelliformis, and several others; but the Betel nut (Areca catechu), the Gomuti (Arenga saccharifera), the Sago palm (Sagus Rumphii), and the slender-stemmed palms seem never to be attacked. I once found a beetle in the act of gnawing through the leaf stalk of a species of Cycad, mistaking it evidently for a palm-tree. It appears that the object of the beetle in thus attacking the trees is to drink the sweet sap in the bud of the palm.\n\nIt is very easy to distinguish trees that have been attacked by this beetle by the peculiar ragged appearance of the leaves. The beetle in burrowing into the bud, often bites straight through the folded leaf in the cabbage, so that when it is unfolded the top is found to be bitten symmetrically off, or each leaflet is perforated regularly. By these appearances, it is easy to tell whether a tree has been attacked or not, and so to judge of the state of the plantation.\n\nI observe that the trees most liable to attack are those in the neighbourhoods of towns. Small isolated patches round the Malay villages in the interior of the island are usually quite free from the attacks, even though the plantations are near mangrove swamps. It has been said that in this position the trees always suffer, and that the grubs are bred in mangrove mud. This is erroneous. I have seen many plantations near mangrove swamps without any trace of damage from beetles,\nand it is exceedingly improbable that the grubs are able to live in mangrove mud. When a plantation is abandoned or neglected, as soon as one or two trees die, the beetles come to attack and lay their eggs in the decaying stumps. From one tree they fly to another, and soon the whole plantation is in a dying state, and if there be any other estates near at hand, the beetle goes on to them, and will do a great deal of damage.\n\nIt would be easy enough in a clean kept estate to keep down the beetles, but where there is an endless supply of them in an adjoining estate, the matter is of great difficulty, and the destruction is something remarkable. A rotten coco-nut tree lasts a very long time in a state of decay, and over a thousand beetles could be bred from one before it was quite destroyed. Not only do the grubs live in the erect and fallen stems, but the butts left in the ground are often full of them, and I have even seen them in the timber of little bridges made of two or three pieces of coco-nut stems laid across a ditch in a plantation.\n\nOther timber they do not attack, as it does not decay into the powdery, soft mass that they require for the grub to live in.\n\nMethods of Destruction.\u2014The usual method of destruction of this insect in the trees, is to employ men to examine the bases of the leaf stalks of the palms frequently, and to search for the beetles. They are provided with a flexible iron or copper wire terminated by a barb, with which the beetle is speared in its burrow and drawn out. A tree once attacked should be frequently examined, as it is more liable to future attacks than those which have never been attacked. So long as the beetle is killed by the spear, there is no real need to extract it; in fact it is, to a certain extent, advantageous to leave its remains in the hole, as no beetles will again enter the hole while the dead one is there. In any case, it is advisable to plug the holes with bits of rag or tufts of fibre dipped in weak carbolic acid, as this will deter beetles. Many planters affirm that putting salt in the crown of the tree will keep away beetles. I have not found this remarkably successful. Probably the salt is indirectly beneficial by being washed\ndown to the roots by the rains, and there absorbed, and as anything that improves the health of a tree enables it also to resist and recover from the attacks of insects, the manuring by salt in this manner is of advantage indirectly against the pest. Kerosine and phenyl may also be used in place of carbolic acid, but they are less effective.\n\nAnother method of destruction consists in making large fires of the fallen leaves and husks in the plantations at night. The brilliant light of the fires attracts the beetles, which are beaten into the fires by men and boys armed with branches of trees.\n\nPlan for Extermination.\u2014Although it is obvious that there will always be sufficient food in the form of decaying vegetable matter to supply the needs of the beetle, so that it is really impossible to exterminate it, its numbers can be very greatly reduced by destroying in and near plantations all rubbish, leaves, husks and other vegetable refuse, or at least not allowing piles of it to accumulate. All dead trees should be cut into small pieces and burnt. And whereas it is absolutely useless for any cultivator to keep his plantations clear of rubbish in which beetles may breed, while his neighbour has so neglected his trees that they become merely nests of beetles, it should be made compulsory on every cultivator of coco-nuts, to however small an extent, to destroy by fire all dead trees on his grounds; nor should he be permitted even to utilize them as bridges or posts in the plantations.\n\nRhynchophorus ferrugineus, the Red Beetle.\u2014This is almost more destructive than the preceding kind, and attacks the palms in quite a different method. It is here not the perfect insect, but the grub that does the injuries.\n\nLike the black beetle, the red weevil is nocturnal in its habits, flying at night to deposit its eggs in the coco-nut trees. Possessed of a remarkably long ovipositor, it finds its way to the base of the leaf-stalk of the palm, and pushes the egg as deeply into the body of the tree as it can. It frequently makes use of the holes made by the elephant beetle, and can often be extracted thence by the beetle-spear. The egg on hatching produces a white footless grub, entirely different in\nappearance to that of the elephant beetle. It burrows tunnels through the soft growing portion of the palm, and when full grown nibbles its way to the surface, and forming an egg-shaped cocoon becomes a chrysalis, and eventually hatches out into the perfect insect. Some persons affirm that the beetle lays its eggs in the base of the tree, and that the grubs then burrow upwards. I have seen no case of this, nor have I ever seen the beetle at the foot of the tree, unless the palm happened to be stemless. In all the trees affected by the red beetle, that I have cut up, I found grubs only in the soft pithy wood at the base of the cabbage, and here they were sometimes thickly crowded together. I have certainly seen burrows made by some insect in the old stems of the coco palm, but I do not believe that they were the work of this animal, but, probably of some Longicorn beetle, several species of which occur here, and the grubs of which eat hard wood.\n\nLike the elephant beetle, this species attacks also other palms besides the coco-nut. Many of those mentioned as attacked by the former in the Botanic Gardens having also been attacked by the latter.\n\nIt is by no means so easy to find out when a palm is attacked by this insect, as it is in the case of the preceding. It works entirely inside the tree, and makes little or no external marks. By listening at the side of the tree the grub can be heard gnawing the wood. But usually the withering and fall of the central shoot is the first sign that anything is wrong. In some cases a tree exudes a shiny liquid having an unpleasant sour smell, which is a sign of serious damage.\n\n*Description of the Grub.*\u2014The grub is a thick, fleshy, cylindrical, opaque white larva, with no feet or antenn\u00e6, quite hairless, except for some scattered hairs on the head and also a few on the tail. The head is small in proportion to the body, oblong and black, with small jaws. The segment next to the head is horny, but softer and paler than the head, with some subtriangular darker patches on either side. The body is curved and wrinkled, and almost equally thick without. The tail ends in a flat, squared process, with a few tubercles on which there are hairs. The grub lives in the burrows which it\nmakes, and which are full of slimy sap exuded from the injured wood. It moves about by the aid of its thickened segments, and usually burrows transversely through the tree. When full grown it attains a length of a little over two inches.\n\nThe Perfect Insect.\u2014The perfect insect varies a good deal in size and colouring. Usually about two inches in length, but often not more than one and a half from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail. Like all weevils, it possesses a long curved snout, which is blunt at the tip, and in the male ornamented with a kind of brush of reddish hairs. The head is very small, and usually more or less red.\n\nThe thorax broadest behind and narrowed in front is black, with a broad red band in the centre, smooth and polished. The wing cases are black, sometimes ornamented with red, grooved longitudinally, and squared and blunt at the ends, a good deal shorter than the body. The tail is black, edged with reddish fur beneath. The legs are strong, rather long, black, with a strong claw on the end of the second joint, besides the two small ones on the feet. The antenn\u00e6 are a little shorter than the snout, abruptly bent in the middle, and ending in a club.\n\nIt is the smallest of the palm-weevils here, and is easily known by the colouring. It flies at night, but is rarely seen on the wing.\n\nMethod of Destruction and Prevention.\u2014This insect, as has been stated above, is a much more difficult one to deal with, but several of the methods in use for the former species will be equally effective with the latter. The insects, both male and female, may often be found at the base of the leaves, and can be extracted with the beetle-spear before the eggs are laid. They may also be destroyed by fires, as in the case of the black beetle.\n\nSome planters have recommended cutting away the fibrous sheath which surrounds the young stem of the palm, and, as they say, trimming and cleaning the palm. But the result is attended with a certain amount of danger. For there is great risk that the trimmer will accidentally wound the tree with his knife, and the beetle is quick to take advantage of this and\nto deposit its eggs in the cut. I quote from *All About the Coco-nut Palm* by Messrs. Ferguson of Colombo, p. 12:\n\n\"Scores of instances might be recorded where, till the trees were come into bearing, a red beetle was never seen, but no sooner was the land cleared and the trees trimmed than it made its appearance and became very destructive. On one property, the trimming system had been carried on for years, till indeed more than one-third of the original plants perished before the estate was ten years old, and they were going at the rate of three trees weekly. The work of trimming was stopped for the reason offered above; the loss of trees continued for some time afterwards, but at the end of six months it had entirely ceased.\"\n\nThe cutting of notches by climbers in the trunk of the trees has been said to be injurious, under the impression that the red beetle may deposit its eggs in the notches, but, as previously stated, it does not attack old wood, that being too hard for the grub, and besides were it to deposit its eggs on the trunk of the tree, it would be exposed to the attacks of birds and bats during the operation. It certainly, however, does take advantage of the holes made by the elephant beetle, and it is very common to find both kinds of beetle in the same holes. It is very probable that the extermination of the black beetle will greatly reduce the number of the red one, by preventing their getting into the heart of the tree by means of the burrows of the black beetle.\n\nMany planters are of opinion that a tree once attacked by the red beetle should be immediately destroyed, on the grounds that the tree is doomed and the grubs in the tree can then be killed. But a very considerable proportion of the trees attacked recover. Unless one or more of the grubs bores through the growing point at the base of the cabbage, or sets up decay in the heart of it, the palm has a very good chance of recovery. At the same time, a tree once attacked is usually liable to further attacks from both kinds of beetles, and unless it is really a valuable tree, it is perhaps hardly worth attempting to save it. It is hardly necessary to state that when the central bud is destroyed, the palm cannot re-\ncover, and is practically dead. In this case, it should be destroyed at once, and the top cut out in order to find the grubs before they escape as beetles. Cutting the grubs out has been tried by several planters, and spearing them through the stem would be equally effective, but the results seem hardly to be worth the trouble. The grub when detected is usually at least half grown, and then deep within the tree, so that the tree has to be very deeply cut into to get at it, and probably this would set up internal decay.\n\nSummary.\u2014It is quite clear that, although it would be impossible to absolutely exterminate every beetle in the place, it will be possible to so far reduce their numbers that the damage done by them is infinitesimal. The large planters may be trusted to keep their plantations clean of any rubbish in which the black beetle may be propagated, and to destroy all dead and decaying palms on the estate, but that will avail little if other persons are permitted to leave dead trees, and piles of tan bark, manure heaps, rotten sugar-cane, &c. in the vicinity of the coco-nut estates, where the elephant beetle may be bred in large numbers. The small cultivator, to whom the loss of a few coco-nut trees is of little importance, should not be permitted to let them get into such a state that they are a source of danger to those of others.\n\nIt should be made compulsory upon every person owning coco-nut trees to cut down and burn all palm-trees that are dead upon the ground at once, nor should he be permitted to stack or store the stems in such manner that they can rot upon the ground, nor to use them for bridges or posts.\n\nIt should also be prohibited to owners of tan-works, sugar-factories, or other persons in whose trade large masses of vegetable d\u00e9bris form a by-product, to permit this refuse to accumulate in such a manner that it threatens the safety of any estate of coco-nuts. As the beetles do not, as a rule, fly to any very great distance, there are spots in which such accumulations would be absolutely harmless, being too far distant from any coco-nuts to send beetles to them, and as in some professions the destruction of such waste might be found very expensive, and perhaps injurious to trade, it might\nperhaps be preferable to merely indict any persons owning such refuse as having a nuisance on his property, should it be shown that any of his neighbours' coco-nut trees were suffering from the ravages of elephant beetles; and should grubs be found in the deposit he should then be compelled to destroy it.\n\nIf these steps are taken, I believe that the injury to the trees caused by the beetle will be mitigated to a very large extent, and the pest almost eradicated.\n\nHENRY N. RIDLEY,\nDirector of Gardens and Forests,\nStraits Settlements.\nBRITISH BORNEO:\nSKETCHES OF\nBRUNAI, SARAWAK, LABUAN\nAND\nNORTH BORNEO.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nIn 1670 Charles II granted to the Hudson's Bay Company a Charter of Incorporation, His Majesty delegating to the Company actual sovereignty over a very large portion of British North America, and assigning to them the exclusive monopoly of trade and mining in the territory. Writing in 1869, Mr. William Forsyth, Q.C., says:\u2014\u201cI have endeavoured to give an account of the constitution and history of the last of the great proprietary companies of England, to whom a kind of delegated authority was granted by the Crown. It was by some of these that distant Colonies were founded, and one, the most powerful of them all, established our Empire in the East and held the sceptre of the Great Mogul. But they have passed away\n\nfuit Ilium et ingens\nGloria Teucrorum\u2014\n\nand the Hudson's Bay Company will be no exception to the rule. It may continue to exist as a Trading Company, but as a Territorial Power it must make up its mind to fold its (buffalo) robes round it and die with dignity.\u201d Prophesying is hazardous work. In November, 1881, two hundred and\neleven years after the Hudson's Bay Charter, and twelve years after the date of Mr. Forsyth's article, Queen Victoria granted a Charter of Incorporation to the British North Borneo Company, which, by confirming the grants and concessions acquired from the Sultans of Brunai and Sulu, constitutes the Company the sovereign ruler over a territory of 31,000 square miles, and, as the permission to trade, included in the Charter, has not been taken advantage of, the British North Borneo Company now does actually exist \"as a Territorial Power\" and not \"as a Trading Company.\"\n\nNot only this, but the example has been followed by Prince Bismarck, and German Companies, on similar lines, have been incorporated by their Government on both coasts of Africa and in the Pacific; and another British Company, to operate on the Niger River Districts, came into existence by Royal Charter in July, 1886.\n\nIt used to be by no means an unusual thing to find an educated person ignorant not only of Borneo's position on the map, but almost of the very existence of the island which, regarding Australia as a continent, and yielding to the claims recently set up by New Guinea, is the second largest island in the world, within whose limits could be comfortably packed England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, with a sea of dense jungle around them, as Wallace has pointed out. Every school-board child now, however, knows better than this.\n\nThough Friar Odoric is said to have visited it about 1322, and Ludovico Berthema, of Bologna, between 1503 and 1507, the existence of this great island, variously estimated to be from 263,000 to 300,000 square miles in extent, did not become generally known to Europeans until, in 1518, the Portuguese Lorenzo de Gomez touched at the city of Brunai. He was followed in 1521 by the Spanish expedition, which under the leadership of the celebrated Portuguese circumnavigator Magellan, had discovered the Philippines, where, on the island of Mactan, their leader was killed in April, 1520. An account of the voyage was written by Pigafetta, an Italian volunteer in the expedition, who accompanied the fleet to Brunai after Magellan's death, and published a glowing\naccount of its wealth and the brilliancy of its Court, with its royally caparisoned elephants, a report which it is very difficult to reconcile with the present squalid condition of the existing \"Venice of Hovels,\" as it has been styled from its palaces and houses being all built in, or rather over, the river to which it owes its name.\n\nThe Spaniards found at Brunai Chinese manufactures and Chinese trading junks, and were so impressed with the importance of the place that they gave the name of Borneo\u2014a corruption of the native name Brunai\u2014to the whole island, though the inhabitants themselves know no such general title for their country.\n\nIn some works, Pulau Kalamantan, which would signify *wild mangoes island*, is given as the native name for Borneo, but it is quite unknown, at any rate throughout North Borneo, and the island is by no means distinguished by any profusion of wild mangoes.*\n\nIn 1573, a Spanish Embassy to Brunai met with no very favourable reception, and three years later an expedition from Manila attacked the place and, deposing a usurping Sultan, re-instated his brother on the throne, who, to shew his gratitude, declared his kingdom tributary to Spain.\n\nThe Portuguese Governor of the Moluccas, in 1526, claimed the honour of being the first discoverer of Borneo, and this nation appears to have carried on trade with some parts of the island till they were driven out of their Colonies by the Dutch in 1609. But neither the Portuguese nor the Spaniards seem to have made any decided attempt to gain a footing in Borneo, and it is not until the early part of the 17th century that we find the two great rivals in the eastern seas\u2014the English and the Dutch East India Trading Companies\u2014turning their attention to the island. The first Dutchman to visit Borneo was OLIVER VAN NOORT, who anchored at Brunai in December, 1600, but though the Sultan was friendly, the natives made an attempt to seize his ship, and he sailed the following month, having come to the conclusion that the city was a nest of rogues.\n\n* The explanation Sago Island has been given, lamantah being the native term for the raw sago sold to the factories.\nThe first English connection with Borneo was in 1609, when trade was opened with Sukadana, diamonds being said to form the principal portion of it.\n\nThe East India Company, in 1702, established a Factory at Banjermassin, on the South Coast, but were expelled by the natives in 1706. Their rivals, the Dutch, also established Trading Stations on the South and South-West Coasts.\n\nIn 1761, the East India Company concluded a treaty with the Sultan of Sulu, and in the following year an English Fleet, under Admiral Drake and Sir William Draper captured Manila, the capital of the Spanish Colony of the Philippines. They found in confinement there a Sultan of Sulu who, in gratitude for his release, ceded to the Company, on the 12th September, 1762, the island of Balambangan, and in January of the following year Mr. Dalrymple was deputed to take possession of it and hoist the British flag. Towards the close of 1763, the Sultan of Sulu added to his cession the northern portion of Borneo and the southern half of Palawan, together with all the intermediate islands. Against all these cessions the Spanish entered their protest, as they claimed the suzerainty over the Sulu Archipelago and the Sulu Dependencies in Borneo and the islands. This claim the Spaniards always persisted in, until, on the 7th March, 1885, a Protocol was entered into by England and Germany and Spain, whereby Spanish supremacy over the Sulu Archipelago was recognised on condition of their abandoning all claim to the portions of Northern Borneo which are now included in the British North Borneo Company's concessions.\n\nIn November, 1768, the Court of Directors in London, with the approval of Her Majesty's Ministers, who promised to afford protection to the new Colony, issued orders to the authorities at Bombay for the establishment of a settlement at Balambangan with the intention of diverting to it the China trade, of drawing to it the produce of the adjoining countries, and of opening a port for the introduction of spices, etc. by the Bugis, and for the sale of Indian commodities. The actual date of the foundation of the settlement is not known, but Mr. F. C. Danvers states that in 1771 the Court ordered that\nthe Government should be vested in \"a chief and two other persons of Council,\" and that the earliest proceedings extant are dated Sulu, 1773, and relate to a broil in the streets between Mr. ALCOCK, the second in the Council, and the Surgeon of the Britannia.\n\nThis was a somewhat unpropitious commencement, and in 1774 the Court are found writing to Madras, to which Balambangan was subordinate, complaining of the \"imprudent management and profuse conduct\" of the Chief and Council.\n\nIn February, 1775, Sulu pirates surprised the stockade, and drove out the settlers, capturing booty valued at about a million dollars. The Company's officials then proceeded to the island of Labuan, now a British Crown Colony, and established a factory, which was maintained but for a short time, at Brunei itself. In 1803 Balambangan was again occupied, but as no commercial advantage accrued, it was abandoned in the following year, and so ended all attempts on the part of the East India Company to establish a Colony in Borneo.\n\nWhile at Balambangan, the officers, in 1774, entered into negotiations with the Sultan of Brunei, and, on undertaking to protect him against Sulu and Mindanau pirates, acquired the exclusive trade in all the pepper grown in his country.\n\nThe settlement of Singapore, the present capital of the Straits Settlements, by Sir STAMFORD RAFFLES, under the orders of the East India Company in 1819, again drew attention to Borneo, for that judiciously selected and free port soon attracted to itself the trade of the Celebes, Borneo and the surrounding countries, which was brought to it by numerous fleets of small native boats. These fleets were constantly harassed and attacked and their crews carried off into slavery by the Balinini, Illanun, and Dyak pirates infesting the Borneo and Celebes coasts, and the interference of the British Cruisers was urgently called for and at length granted, and was followed, in the natural course of events, by political intervention, resulting in the brilliant and exciting episode whereby the modern successor of the olden heroes\u2014Sir JAMES BROOKE\u2014obtained for his family, in 1840, the kingdom of Sarawak, on the west coast of the island,\nwhich he in time purged of its two plague spots\u2014head-hunting on shore, and piracy and slave-dealing afloat\u2014and left to his heir, who has worthily taken up and carried on his work, the unique inheritance of a settled Eastern Kingdom, inhabited by the once dreaded head-hunting Dyaks and piratical Mahomedan Malays, the government of whom now rests absolutely in the hands of its one paternally despotic white ruler, or R\u00e1ja. Sarawak, although not yet formally proclaimed a British Protectorate,* may thus be deemed the first permanent British possession in Borneo. Sir JAMES BROOKE was also employed by the British Government to conclude, on 27th May, 1847, a treaty with the Sultan of Brunai, whereby the cession to us of the small island of Labuan, which had been occupied as a British Colony in December, 1846, was confirmed, and the Sultan engaged that no territorial cession of any portion of his country should ever be made to any Foreign Power without the sanction of Great Britain.\n\nThese proceedings naturally excited some little feeling of jealousy in our Colonial neighbours\u2014the Dutch\u2014who ineffectually protested against a British subject becoming the ruler of Sarawak, as a breach of the tenor of the treaty of London of 1824, and they took steps to define more accurately the boundaries of their own dependencies in such other parts of Borneo as were still open to them. What we now call British North Borneo, they appear at that time to have regarded as outside the sphere of their influence, recognising the Spanish claim to it through their suzerainty, already alluded to, over the Sulu Sultan.\n\nWith this exception, and that of the Brunai Sultanate, already secured by the British Treaty, and Sarawak, now the property of the BROOKE family, the Dutch have acquired a nominal suzerainty over the whole of the rest of Borneo, by treaties with the independent rulers\u2014an area comprising about two-thirds of the whole island, probably not a tenth part of which is under their actual direct administrative control.\n\n* A British Protectorate was established over North Borneo on the 12th May, over Sarawak on the 14th June, and over Brunai on the 17th September, 1888. Vide Appendix.\nThey appear to have been so pre-occupied with the affairs of their important Colony of Java and its dependencies, and the prolonged, exhausting and ruinously expensive war with the Achinese in Sumatra, that beyond posting Government Residents at some of the more important points, they have hitherto done nothing to attract European capital and enterprise to Borneo, but it would now seem that the example set by the British Company in the North is having its effect, and I hear of a Tobacco Planting Company and of a Coal Company being formed to operate on the East Coast of Dutch Borneo.\n\nThe Spanish claim to North Borneo was a purely theoretical one, and not only their claim, but that also of the Sulus through whom they claimed, was vigorously disputed by the Sultans of Brunai, who denied that, as asserted by the Sulus, any portion of Borneo had been ceded to them by a former Sultan of Brunai, who had by their help defeated rival claimants and been seated on the throne. The Sulus, on their side, would own no allegiance to the Spaniards, with whom they had been more or less at war for almost three centuries, and their actual hold over any portion of North Borneo was of the slightest. Matters were in this position when Mr. Alfred Dent, now Sir Alfred Dent, K.C.M.G., fitted out an expedition, and in December, 1877, and January, 1878, obtained from the Sultans of Brunai and Sulu, in the manner hereafter detailed, the sovereign control over the North portion of Borneo, from the Kimanis river on the West to the Siboku river on the East, concessions which were confirmed by Her Majesty's Royal Charter in November, 1881.\n\nI have now traced, in brief outline, the political history of Borneo from the time when the country first became generally known to Europeans\u2014in 1518\u2014down to its final division between Great Britain and the Netherlands in 1881.\n\nIf we can accept the statements of the earlier writers, Borneo was in its most prosperous stage before it became subjected to European influences, after which, owing to the mistaken and monopolising policy of the Commercial Companies then holding sway in the East, the trade and agriculture of this and other islands of the Malay Archipelago received a\nblow from which at any rate that of Borneo is only now recovering. By the terms of its Charter, the British North Borneo Company is prohibited from creating trade monopolies, and of its own accord it has decided not to engage itself in trading transactions at all, and as R\u00e1ja BROOKE'S Government is similar to that of a British Crown Colony, and the Dutch Government no longer encourage monopolies, there is good ground for believing that the wrong done is being righted, and that a brighter page than ever is now being opened for Borneo and its natives.\n\nBefore finishing with this part of the subject, I may mention that the United States Government had entered into a treaty with the Sultan of Brunei, in almost exactly the same words as the English one, including the clause prohibiting cessions of territory without the consent of the other party to the treaty, and, in 1878, Commodore SCHUFELDT was ordered by his Government to visit Borneo and report on the cessions obtained by Mr. DENT. I was Acting British Consul-General at the time, and before leaving the Commodore informed me emphatically that he could discover no American interests in Borneo, \"neither white nor black.\"\n\nThe native population of Borneo is given in books of reference as between 1,750,000 and 2,500,000. The aborigines are of the Malay race, which itself is a variety of the Mongolian and indeed, when inspecting prisoners, I have often been puzzled to distinguish the Chinese from the Malay, they being dressed alike and the distinctive pig-tail having been shaved off the former as part of the prison discipline.\n\nThese Mongolian Malays from High Asia, who presumably migrated to the Archipelago via the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, must, however, have found Borneo and other of the islands partially occupied by a Caucasie race, as amongst the aborigines are still found individuals of distinctive Caucasian type, as has been pointed out to be the case with the Buludupih tribe of British North Borneo, by Dr. MONTANO, whom I had the pleasure of meeting in Borneo in 1878-9. To these the name of pre-Malays has been given, but Professor KEANE, to whom I beg to acknowledge my indebtedness on\nthese points, prefers the title of Indonesians. The scientific descriptions of a typical Malay is as follows:\u2014\"Stature little over five feet, complexion olive yellow, head brachy-cephalous or round, cheek-bones prominent, eyes black and slightly oblique, nose small but not flat, nostrils dilated, hands small and delicate, legs thin and weak, hair black, coarse and lank, beard absent or scant;\" but these Indonesians to whom belong most of the indigenous inhabitants of Celebes, are taller and have fairer or light brown complexions and regular features, connecting them with the brown Polynesians of the Eastern Pacific \"who may be regarded as their descendants,\" and Professor Keane accounts for their presence by assuming \"a remote migration of the Caucasoid race to South-Eastern Asia, of which evidences are not lacking in Camboja and elsewhere, and a further onward movement, first to the Archipelago and then East to the Pacific.\" It is needless to say that the aborigines themselves have the haziest and most unscientific notion of their own origin, as the following account, gravely related to me by a party of Buludupihs, will exemplify:\n\n\"The Origin of the Buludupih Race.\n\nIn past ages a Chinese* settler had taken to wife a daughter of the aborigines, by whom he had a female child. Her parents lived in a hilly district (Bulud = hill), covered with a large forest tree, known by the name of opih. One day a jungle fire occurred, and after it was over, the child jumped down from the house (native houses are raised on piles off the ground), and went up to look at a half burnt opih log, and suddenly disappeared and was never seen again. But the parents heard the voice of a spirit issue from the log, announcing that it had taken the child to wife and that, in course of time, the bereaved parents would find an infant in the jungle, whom they were to consider as the offspring of the marriage,\n\n* The Buludupihs inhabit the China or Kina-batangan river, and Sir Hugh Low, in a note to his history of the Sultans of Brunei, in a number of the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, says that it is probable that in former days the Chinese had a Settlement or Factory at that river, as some versions of the native history of Brunei expressly state that the Chinese wife of one of the earliest Sultans was brought thence.\nand who would become the father of a new race. The prophecy of the spirit was in due time fulfilled.\"\n\nIt somewhat militates against the correctness of this history that the Buludupihs are distinguished by the absence of Mongolian features.\n\nThe general appellation given to the aborigines by the modern Malays\u2014to whom reference will be made later on\u2014is Dyak, and they are divided into numerous tribes, speaking very different dialects of the Malayo-Polynesian stock, and known by distinctive names, the origin of which is generally obscure, at least in British North Borneo, where these names are not, as a rule, derived from those of the rivers on which they dwell.\n\nThe following are the names of some of the principal North Borneo aboriginal tribes:\u2014Kadaians, Dusuns, Ida'ans, Bisaias, Buludupihs, Eraans, Subans, Sun-Dyaks, Muruts, Tagaas. Of these, the Kadaians, Buludupihs, Eraans and one large section of the Bisaias have embraced the religion of Mahomet; the others are Pagans, with no set form of religion, no idols, but believing in spirits and in a future life, which they localise on the top of the great mountain of Kina-balu. These Pagans are a simple and more natural, less self-conscious, people than their Mahomedan brethren, who are ahead of them in point of civilization, but are more reserved, more proud and altogether less \"jolly,\" and appear, with their religion, to have acquired also some of the characteristics of the modern or true Malays. A Pagan can sit, or rather squat, with you and tell you legends, or, perhaps, on an occasion join in a glass of grog, whereas the Mahomedan, especially the true Malay, looks upon the Englishman as little removed from a \"Kafir\"\u2014an uncircumcised Philistine\u2014who through ignorance constantly offends in minor points of etiquette, who eats pig and drinks strong drink, is ignorant of the dignity of repose, and whose accidental physical and political superiority in the present world will be more than compensated for by the very inferior and uncomfortable position he will attain in the next. The aborigines inhabit the interior parts of North Borneo, and all along the coast is found a fringe of true Malays, talk-\ning modern Malay and using the Arabic written character, whereas the aborigines possess not even the rudiments of an alphabet and, consequently, no literature at all.\n\nHow is the presence in Borneo of this more highly civilized product of the Malay race, differing so profoundly in language and manners from their kinsmen\u2014the aborigines\u2014to be accounted for? Professor Keane once more comes to our assistance, and solves the question by suggesting that the Mongolian Malays from High Asia who settled in Sumatra, attained there a real national development in comparatively recent times, and after their conversion to Mahomedanism by the Arabs, from whom, as well as from the Bhuddist missionaries who preceded them, they acquired arts and an elementary civilization, spread to Borneo and other parts of Malaysia and quickly asserted their superiority over the less advanced portion of their race already settled there. This theory fits in well with the native account of the distribution of the Malay race, which makes Menangkabau, in Southern Sumatra, the centre whence they spread over the Malayan islands and peninsula.\n\nThe Professor further points out, that in prehistoric times the Malay and Indonesian stock spread westwards to Madagascar and eastwards to the Philippines and Formosa, Micronesia and Polynesia. \"This astonishing expansion of the Malaysian people throughout the Oceanic area is sufficiently attested by the diffusion of common (Malayo-Polynesian) speech from Madagascar to Easter Island and from Hawaii to New Zealand.\"\n\nChapter II.\n\nThe headquarters of the true Malay in Northern Borneo is the City of Brunai, on the river of that name, on the North-West Coast of the island, where resides the Court of the only nominally independent Sultan now remaining in the Archipelago.*\n\nThe Brunai river is probably the former mouth of the Limbang, and is now more a salt water inlet than a river. Con-\n\n* He has since been \"protected\"\u2014see ante page 6, note.\ntrary, perhaps, to the general idea, an ordinary eastern river, at any rate until the limit of navigability for European craft is attained, is not, as a rule, a thing of beauty by any means.\n\nThe typical Malay river debouches through flat, fever-haunted swampy country, where, for miles, nothing meets the eye but the monotonous dark green of the level, interminable mangrove forest, with its fantastic, interlacing roots, whose function it appears to be to extend seaward, year by year, its dismal kingdom of black fetid mud, and to veil from the rude eye of the intruder the tropical charms of the country at its back. After some miles of this cheerless scenery, and at a point where the fresh water begins to mingle with the salt, the handsome and useful *nipa* palm, with leaves twenty to thirty feet in length, which supply the native with the material for the walls and roof of his house, the wrapper for his cigarette, the sugar for his breakfast table, the salt for his daily needs and the strong drink to gladden his heart on his feast days, becomes intermixed with the mangrove and finally takes its place\u2014a pleasing change, but still monotonous, as it is so dense that, itself growing in the water, it quite shuts out all view of the bank and surrounding country.\n\nOne of the first signs of the fresh river water, is the occurrence on the bank of the graceful *nibong* palm, with its straight, slender, round stem, twenty to thirty feet in height, surmounted with a plume of green leaves. This palm, cut into lengths and requiring no further preparation, is universally employed by the Malay for the posts and beams of his house, always raised several feet above the level of the ground, or of the water, as the case may be, and, split up into lathes of the requisite size, forms the frame-work of the walls and roof, and constitutes the flooring throughout. With the pithy centre removed, the *nibong* forms an efficient aqueduct, in the absence of bambu, and its young, growing shoot affords a cabbage, or salad, second only to that furnished by the coconut, which will next come into view, together with the betel (*Areca*) nut palm, if the river visited is an inhabited one; but if uninhabited, the traveller will find nothing but thick, almost impenetrable jungle, with mighty trees shooting up one hun-\ndred to a hundred and fifty feet without a branch, in their endeavour to get their share of the sun-light, and supporting on their trunks and branches enormous creepers, rattans, graceful ferns and lovely orchids and other luxuriant epiphytal growths. Such is the typical North Borneo river, to which, however, the Brunai is a solitary exception. The mouth of the Brunai river is approached between pretty verdant islets, and after passing through a narrow and tortuous passage, formed naturally by sandbanks and artificially by a barrier of stones, bare at low water, laid down in former days to keep out the restless European, you find your vessel, which to cross the bar should not draw more than thirteen or fourteen feet, in deep water between green, grassy, hilly, picturesque banks, with scarcely a sign of the abominable mangrove, or even of the nipa, which, however, to specially mark the contrast formed by this stream, are both to be found in abundance in the upper portion of the river, which the steamer cannot enter. After passing a small village or two, the first object which used to attract attention was the brick ruins of a Roman Catholic Church, which had been erected here by the late Father Cuarteron, a Spanish Missionary of the Society of the Propaganda Fide, who, originally a jovial sea captain, had the good fortune to light upon a wrecked treasure ship in the Eastern seas, and, feeling presumably unwonted twinges of conscience, decided to devote the greater part of his wealth to the Church, in which he took orders, eventually attaining the rank of Prefect Apostolic. His Mission, unfortunately, was a complete failure, but though his assistants were withdrawn, he stuck to his post to the last and, no doubt, did a certain amount of good in liberating, from time to time, Spanish subjects he found in slavery on the Borneo Coast.\n\nHad the poor fellow settled in the interior, amongst the Pagans, he might, by his patience and the example of his good life, have made some converts, but amongst the Mahomedans of the coast it was labour in vain. The bricks of his Brunai Church have since been sold to form the foundation of a steam sawmill.\n\nTurning a sharp corner, the British Consulate is reached,\nwhere presides, and flies with pride the Union Jack, Her Majesty's Consular Agent, Mr. or Inche MAHOMET, with his three wives and thirteen children. He is a native of Malacca and a clever, zealous, courteous and hospitable official, well versed in the political history of Brunei since the advent of Sir JAMES BROOKE.\n\nThe British is the only Consulate now established at Brunei, but once the stars and stripes proudly waved over the Consulate of an unpaid American Consul. There was little scope at Brunei for a white man in pursuit of the fleeting dollar, and one day the Consulate was burnt to the ground, and a heavy claim for compensation for this alleged act of incendiarism was sent in to the Sultan. His Highness disputed the claim, and an American man-of-war was despatched to make enquiries on the spot. In the end, the compensation claimed was not enforced, and Mr. MOSES, the Consul, was not subsequently, I think, appointed to any other diplomatic or consular post by the President of the Republic. A little further on are the palaces, shops and houses of the city of Brunei, all, with the exception of a few brick shops belonging to Chinamen, built over the water in a reach where the river broadens out, and a vessel can steam up the High Street and anchor abreast of the Royal Palace. When PIGAFETTA visited the port in 1521, he estimated the number of houses at 25,000, which, at the low average of six to a house, would give Brunei a population of 150,000 people, many of whom were Chinese, cultivating pepper gardens, traces of which can still be seen on the now deserted hills. Sir SPENCER ST. JOHN, formerly H. B. M. Consul-General in Borneo, and who put the population at 25,000 at the lowest in 1863, asserts that fifteen is a fair average to assign to a Brunei house, which would make the population in PIGAFETTA'S time 375,000. From his enquiries he found that the highest number was seventy, in the Sultan's palace, and the lowest seven, in a fisherman's small hut. PIGAFETTA, however, probably alluded to families, fires I think is the word he makes use of, and more than one family is often found occupying a Brunei house. The present population perhaps does not number\nmore than 12,000 or 15,000 natives, and about eighty Chinese and a few Kling shop-keepers, as natives of India are here styled. Writing in 1845, Sir James Brooke, then the Queen's first Commissioner to Brunei, says with reference to this Sultanate:\u2014\"Here the experiment may be fairly tried, on the smallest possible scale of expense, whether a beneficial European influence may not re-animate a falling State and at the same time extend our commerce. * * * If this tendency to decay and extinction be inevitable, if this approximation of European policy to native Government should be unable to arrest the fall of the Bornean dynasty, yet we shall retrieve a people already habituated to European habits and manners, industrious interior races; and if it become necessary, a Colony gradually formed and ready to our hand in a rich and fertile country,\" and elsewhere he admits that the regeneration of the Borneo Malays through themselves was a hobby of his.\n\nThe experiment has been tried and, so far as concerns the re-animation of the Malay Government of Brunei, the verdict must be \"a complete failure.\" The English are a practical race, and self-interest is the guide of nations in their intercourse with one another; it was not to be supposed that they would go out of their way to teach the degenerate Brunei aristocracy how to govern in accordance with modern ideas; indeed, the Treaty we made with them, by prohibiting, for instance, their levying customs duties, or royalties, on the export of such jungle products as gutta percha and India rubber, in the collection of which the trees yielding them are entirely destroyed, and by practically suggesting to them the policy, or rather the impolicy, of imposing the heavy due of $1 per registered ton on all European Shipping entering their ports, whether in cargo or in ballast, scarcely tended to stave off their collapse, and the Borneans must have formed their own conclusions from the fact that when they gave up portions of their territory to the Brookes and to the British North Borneo Company, the British Government no longer called for the observance of these provisions of the Treaty in the ceded districts. The English have got all they wanted from Brunei, but I think it can scarcely be said that they have\ndone very much for it in return. I remember that the late Sultan thought it an inexplicable thing that we could not assist him to recover a debt due to him by one of the British Coal Companies which tried their luck in Borneo. Moreover, even the cession to their good and noble friend Sir James Brooke of the Brunai Province of Sarawak has been itself also, to a certain extent, a factor in their Government's decay, that State, under the rule of the R\u00e1ja\u2014Charles Brooke\u2014having attained its present prosperous condition at the expense of Brunai and by gradually absorbing its territory.\n\nBetween British North Borneo, on the one side, and Sarawak, on the other, the sea-board of Brunai, which, when we first appeared on the scene, extended from Cape Datu to Marudu Bay\u2014some 700 miles\u2014is now reduced to 125 or 130 miles, and, besides the river on which it is built, Brunai retains but two others of any importance, both of which are in rebellion of a more or less vigorous character, and the whole State of Brunai is so sick that its case is now under the consideration of Her Majesty's Government.\n\nThus ends in collapse the history of the last independent Malay Government. Excepting only Johor (which is prosperous owing to its being under the wing of Singapore, which fact gives confidence to European and Chinese capitalists and Chinese labourers, and to its good fortune in having a wise and just ruler in its Sultan, who owes his elevation to British influences), all the Malay Governments throughout the Malay Archipelago and in the Malay Peninsula are now subject either to the English, the Dutch, the Spanish or the Portuguese. This decadence is not due to any want of vitality in the race, for under European rule the Malay increases his numbers, as witness the dense population of Java and the rapidly growing Malay population of the Straits Settlements.\n\nThat the Malay does so flourish in contact with the European and the Chinese is no doubt to some extent due to his attachment to the Mahomedan faith, which as a tee-total religion is, so far, the most suitable one for a tropical race; it has also to be remembered that he inhabits tropical countries, where the white man cannot perform out-door labour\nand appears only as a Government Official, a merchant or a planter.\n\nBut the decay of the Brunai aristocracy was probably inevitable. Take the life of a young noble. He is the son of one of perhaps thirty women in his father's harem, his mother is entirely without education, can neither read nor write, is never allowed to appear in public or have any influence in public affairs, indeed scarcely ever leaves her house, and one of her principal excitements, perhaps, is the carrying on of an intrigue, an excitement enhanced by the fact that discovery means certain death to herself and her lover.\n\nBrunai being a water town, the youngster has little or no chance of a run and game ashore, and any exercise he takes is confined to being paddled up and down the river in a canoe, for to paddle himself would be deemed much too degrading\u2014a Brunai noble should never put his hand to any honest physical work\u2014even for his own recreation. I once imported a Rob Roy canoe from England and amused myself by making long paddling excursions, and I would also sometimes, to relieve the monotony of a journey in a native boat, take a spell at the paddle with the men, and I was gravely warned by a native friend that by such action I was seriously compromising myself and lowering my position in the eyes of the higher class of natives. At an early age the young noble becomes an object of servile adulation to the numerous retainers and slaves, both male and female, and is by them initiated in vicious practices and, while still a boy, acquires from them some of the knowledge of a fast man of the world. As a rule he receives no sort of school education. He neither rides nor joins in the chase and, since the advent of Europeans, there have been no wars to brace his nerves, or call out any of the higher qualities of mind or body which may be latent in him; nor is there any standing army or navy in which he might receive a beneficial training. No political career, in the sense we attach to the term, is open to him, and he has no feelings of patriotism whatever. That an aristocracy thus nurtured should degenerate can cause no surprise. The general term for the nobles amongst the Brunais is Pangeran, and their numbers may be\nguessed when it is understood that every son and daughter of every many-wived noble is also a Pangeran.\n\nSome of these unfortunate noblemen have nothing where-with to support their position, and in very recent times I have actually seen a needy Pangeran, in a British Colony where he could not live by oppression or theft, driven to work in a coal mine or drive a buffalo cart.\n\nWith the ordinary freeborn citizen of Brunei life opens under better auspices. The children are left much to themselves and are merry, precocious, naked little imps, able to look out for themselves at a very much earlier age than is the case with European infants, and it is wonderful to see quite little babies clambering up the rickety stairs leading from the river to the house, or crawling unheeded on the tottering verandahs. Almost before they can walk they can swim, and they have been known to share their mother's cigarettes while still in arms. All day long they amuse themselves in miniature canoes, rolling over and over in the water, regardless of crocodiles. Happy children! they have no school and no clothes\u2014one might, perhaps, exclaim happy parents, too! Malays are very kind and indulgent to their children and I do not think I have seen or heard of a case of the application of the parental hand to any part of the infant person. As soon as he is strong enough, say eight or nine years of age, the young Malay, according to the kampong, or division of the town, in which his lot has been cast, joins in his father's trade and becomes a fisherman, a trader, or a worker in brass or in iron as the case may be. The girls have an equally free and easy time while young; their only garments being a silver fig leaf, fastened to a chain or girdle round the waist. As they grow up they help their mothers in their household duties, or by selling their goods in the daily floating market; they marry young and are, as a rule, kindly treated by their husbands. Although Mahomedans, they can go about freely and unveiled, a privilege denied to their sisters of the higher classes. The greatest misfortune for such a girl is, perhaps, the possession of a pretty face and figure, which may result in her being honoured with the attentions of a noble, in whose harem she\nmay be secluded for the rest of her life, and, as her charms wane her supply of both food and clothing is reduced to the lowest limit.\n\nBy the treaty with Great Britain traffic in slaves is put down, that is, Borneo is no longer the mart where, as in former days, the pirates can bring in their captives for sale; but the slaves already in the place have not been liberated, and a slave's children are slaves, so that domestic slavery, as it is termed, exists on a very considerable scale in Brunai. Slaves were acquired in the old days by purchase from pirates and, on any pretext, from the Pagan tribes of Borneo. For instance, if a feudal chief of an outlying river was in want of some cash, nothing was easier than for him to convict a man, who was the father of several children, of some imaginary offence, or neglect of duty, and his children, girls and boys, would be seized and carried off to Brunai as slaves. A favourite method was that of \"forced trade.\" The chief would send a large quantity of trade goods to a Pagan village and leave them there to be sold at one hundred per cent. or more above their proper value, all legitimate trade being prohibited meanwhile, and if the money or barter goods were not forthcoming when demanded, the deficiency would be made up in slaves. This kind of oppression was very rife in the neighbourhood of the capital when I first became acquainted with Borneo in 1871, but the power of the chiefs has been much curtailed of late, owing to the extensive cessions of territory to Sarawak and the British North Borneo Company, and their hold on the rivers left to them has become very precarious, since the warlike Kyans passed under R\u00e1ja Brooke's sway. This tribe, once the most powerful in Borneo, was always ready at the Sultan's call to raid on any tribe who had incurred his displeasure and revelled in the easy acquisition of fresh heads, over which to hold the triumphal dance. The Brunai Malays are not a warlike race, and the R\u00e1jas find that, without the Kyans, they are as a tiger with its teeth drawn and its claws pared, and the Pagan tribes have not been slow to make the discovery for themselves. Those on the Limbang river have been in open rebellion for the last three or four years\nand are crying out to be taken under the protection of the Queen, or, failing that, then under the \"Kompani,\" as the British North Borneo Company's Government like that of the East India Company in days gone by, is styled, or under Sarawak.\n\nThe condition of the domestic slaves is not a particularly hard one unless, in the case of a girl, she is compelled to join the harem, when she becomes technically free, but really only changes one sort of servitude for another and more degrading one. With this exception, the slaves live on friendly terms with their masters' families, and the propinquity of a British Colony\u2014Labuan\u2014has tended to ameliorate their condition, as an ill-used slave can generally find means to escape thither and, so long as he remains there, he is a free man.\n\nThe scientific description of a typical Malay has already been given, and it answers well on almost all points for the Brunai specimen, except that the nose, as well as being small, is, in European eyes, deficient as to \"bridge,\" and the legs cannot be described as weak, indeed the Brunai Malay, male and female, is a somewhat fleshy animal. In temperament, the Malay is described as \"taciturn, undemonstrative, little given to outward manifestations of joy or sorrow, courteous towards each other, kind to their women and children. Not elated by good or depressed by bad fortune, but capable of excesses when roused. Under the influence of religious excitement, losses at gambling, jealousy or other domestic troubles they are liable to amok or run-a-muck, an expression which appears to have passed into the English language.\" With strangers, the Brunai Malay is doubtless taciturn, but I have heard Brunai ladies among themselves, while enjoying their betel-nut, rival any old English gossips over their cup of tea, and on an expedition the men will sometimes keep up a conversation long into the night till begged to desist. Courtesy seems to be innate in every Malay of whatever rank, both in their intercourse with one another and with strangers. The meeting at Court of two Brunai nobles who, perhaps, entertain feelings of the greatest hatred towards each other, is an interesting study, and the display of mutual courtesy unrivalled.\nI need scarcely say that horseplay and practical joking are unknown, contradiction is rarely resorted to and \"chaff\" is only known in its mildest form. The lowest Malay will never pass in front of you if it can be avoided, nor hand anything to another across you. Unless in case of necessity, a Malay will not arouse his friend from slumber, and then only in the gentlest manner possible. It is bad manners to point at all, but, if it is absolutely necessary to do so, the forefinger is never employed, but the person or object is indicated, in a sort of shamefaced way, with the thumb. It is impolite to bare a weapon in public, and Europeans often show their ignorance of native etiquette by asking a Malay visitor to let them examine the blade of the kris he is wearing. It is not considered polite to enquire after the welfare of the female members of a Brunei gentleman's household. For a Malay to uncover his head in your presence would be an impertinence, but a guttural noise in his throat after lunching with you is a polite way of expressing pleased satisfaction with the excellence of the repast. This latter piece of etiquette has probably been adopted from the Chinese. The low social position assigned to women by Brunei Malays, as by nearly all Mahomedan races, is of course a partial set-off to the general courtesy that characterises them. The average intelligence of what may be called the working class Malay is almost as far superior to that, say, of the British country bumpkin as are his manners. Mr. H. O. Forbes says in his \"Naturalist in the Eastern Archipelago\" that he was struck with the natives' acute observation in natural history and the accuracy with which they could give the names, habits and uses of animals and plants in the jungle, and the traveller cannot but admire the general handiness and adaptability to changed circumstances and customs and quickness of understanding of the Malay coolies whom he engages to accompany him.\n\nCannot one imagine the stolid surprise and complete obfuscation of the English peasant if an intelligent Malay traveller were to be suddenly set down in his district, making enquiries as to the, to him, novel forms of plants and animals and asking for minute information as to the manners and customs of\nthe new people amongst whom he found himself, and, generally, seeking for information as the reasons for this and for that?\n\nTheir religion sits somewhat lightly on the Brunei Malays; the Mahomedan Mosque in the capital was always in a very dirty and neglected state, though prayers were said there daily, and I have never seen a Borneo Malay under the influence of religious excitement.\n\nGambling prevails, doubtless, and so does cock-fighting, but neither is the absorbing passion which it seems, from travellers' accounts, to be with Malays elsewhere.\n\nWhen visiting the Spanish settlements in Sulu and Balabac, I was surprised to find regular officially licensed cock-fighting pits, with a special seat for the Spanish Governor, who was expected to be present on high days and holidays. I have never come across a regular cockpit in Brunei, or in any part of northern Borneo.\n\nThe amoks that I have been cognisant of have, consequently, not been due to either religious excitement, or to losses at gambling, but, in nearly every case, to jealousy and domestic trouble, and their occurrence almost entirely confined to the British Colony of Labuan where, of course, the Mahomedan pains and penalties for female delinquencies could not be enforced. I remember one poor fellow whom I pitied very much. He had good reason to be jealous of his wife and, in our courts, could not get the redress he sought. He explained to me that a mist seemed to gather before his eyes and that he became utterly unconscious of what he was doing\u2014his will was quite out of his control. Some half dozen people\u2014children, men and women\u2014were killed, or desperately wounded before he was overpowered. He acknowledged his guilt, and suffered death at the hands of the hangman with quiet dignity.\n\nMany tragical incidents in the otherwise uneventful history of Labuan may be traced to the manner in which marriages are contracted amongst the Borneo Malays. Marriages of mere love are almost unknown; they are generally a matter of bargain between the girls' parents and the expectant bridegroom, or his parents, and, practically, everything depends on\nthe amount of the dowry or brihan\u2014literally \"gift\"\u2014which the swain can pay to the former. In their own country there exist certain safeguards which prevent any abuse of this system, but it was found that under the English law a clever parent could manage to dispose of his daughter's hand several times over, so that really the plot of Mrs. Campbell Praed's somewhat unpleasant play \"Arianne\" was anticipated in the little colony of Labuan. I was once called upon, as Coroner, to inquire into the deaths of a young man and his handsome young wife, who were discovered lying dead, side by side, on the floor of their house. The woman was found to be fearfully cut about; the man had but one wound, in his abdomen, penetrating the bowels. There was only one weapon by which the double murder could have been committed, a knife with a six inch blade, and circumstances seemed to point to the probability that the woman had first stabbed the man, who had then wrenched the knife from her grasp and hacked her to death. The man was not quite dead when found and he accused the dead woman of stabbing him. It was found, that they had not long been married and that, apparently with the girl's consent, her father had been negotiating for her marriage with another. The father himself was subsequently the first man murdered in British North Borneo after the assumption of the Government by the Company, and his murderer was the first victim of the law in the new Colony. Altogether a tragic story.\n\nMany years ago another amok, which was near being tragical, had an almost comical termination. The then Colonial Treasurer was an entertaining Irishman of rather mature age. Walking down to his office one day he found in the road a Malay hacking at his wife and another man. Home rule not being then in fashion with the Irish, the Treasurer, armed only with his sun umbrella, attempted to interfere, when the amoker turned furiously on him and the Irish official, who was of spare build, took to his heels and made good his escape, the chase, though a serious matter to him, causing irrepressible mirth to onlookers. The man was never captured, and his victims, though disfigured, recovered. I remem-\nber being struck by the contemptuous reply of Sir Hugh Low's Chinese servant when he warned him to be on his guard, as there was an *amoker* at large, and alluded to Mr. C.'s narrow escape\u2014it was to the effect that the Treasurer was foolish to interfere in other people's concerns. This unwillingness to busy oneself in others' affairs, which sometimes has the appearance of callousness, is characteristic of Malays and Chinese.\n\nThe readers of a book of travels are somewhat under a disadvantage in forming their opinion of a country, in that incidents are focussed for them by those of the same nature being grouped together. I do not wish it to be thought that murders and *amoks* are at all common occurrences in Northern Borneo, indeed they are very few and far between, and criminal acts of all kinds are remarkably infrequent, that is, of course, if we regard head-hunting as an amusement sanctioned by usage, especially as, in the parts under native government, there is a total absence of any kind of police force, while every man carries arms, and houses with palm leaf walls and innocent of locks, bolts and bars, offer unusual temptations to the burglariously inclined. My wife and I nearly always slept without a watchman and with the doors and windows unclosed, the servants' offices being detached from the house, and we have never had any of our property stolen except by a \"boy.\"\n\nBrunei is governed by a Sultan styled Lang-di-pertuan, \"he who rules,\" and four principal Ministers of State, \"Wazirs\"\u2014the Pangeran Bandahara, the Pangeran diGadong, the Pangeran Pamancha and the Pangeran Temenggong. These Ministers are generally men of the royal blood, and fly distinctive flags at their residences, that of the Bandahara being white, of the di Gadong, green, and of the Temenggong, red. The flags are remarkably simple and inexpensive, but quite distinctive, each consisting of a square bit of bunting or cloth of the requisite colour, with the exception of the Temenggong's, which is cut in the shape of a burgee. The Sultan's flag is a plain piece of yellow bunting, yellow being the Brunei royal colour, and no man, except the\nSovereign, is permitted to exhibit that colour in any portion of his dress. It shows how little importance attaches to the female sex that a lady, even a slave, can sport yellow in her dress, or any colour she chooses. Theoretically the duties of the Bandahara are those of a Home Secretary; the di Gadong is Keeper of the Seal and Chancellor of the Exchequer; the Pamancha\u2019s functions I am rather uncertain about, as the post has remained unfilled for many years past, but they would seem to partake of those of a Home Secretary; and the Temenggong is the War Minister and Military and Naval Commander-in-chief, and appears also to hear and decide criminal and civil cases in the city of Brunei. These appointments are made by the Sultan, and for life, but it will be understood that, in such a rough and ready system of government as that of Brunei, the actual influence of each Minister depends entirely on his own character and that of the Sultan. Sometimes one Minister will practically usurp the functions of some, or, perhaps, all the others, leaving them only their titles and revenues, while often, on a vacancy occurring, the Sultan does not make a fresh appointment, but himself appropriates the revenue of the office leaving the duties to take care of themselves.\n\nTo look after trade and commerce there is, in theory, an inferior Minister, the Pangeran Shabander.\n\nThere is another class of Ministers\u2014Mantri\u2014who are selected by the Sultan from among the people, and are chosen for their intelligence and for the influence and following they have amongst the citizens. They possess very considerable political power, their opinions being asked on important matters. Such are the two Juwatans and the Orang Kaya di Gadong, who may be looked upon as the principal officers of the Sultan and the Wazirs.\n\nThe State officials are paid by the revenues of certain districts which are assigned, as will be seen below, to the different offices.\n\nThe Mahomedan Malays, it has already been explained, were an invading and conquering race in Borneo, and their chiefs would seem to have divided the country, or, rather, the\ninhabitants, amongst themselves, in much the same way as England was parcelled out among the followers of William the Conqueror. The people of all the rivers* and of the interior, up to the limits where the Brunei Malays can enforce their authority, own as their feudal lord and pay taxes to either the Sultan, in his unofficial capacity, or to one of the nobles, or else they are attached to the office of Sultan or one of the great Ministers of State, and, again theoretically speaking, all the districts in the Sultanate are known, from the fact of the people on them belonging to a noble, or to the reigning Sultan for the time being, or to one of the Ministers of State, as either:\n\n1. Ka-r\u00e1jahan\u2014belonging to the Sultan or R\u00e1ja.\nor 2. Kouripan\u2014belonging to certain public officials during their term of office.\nor 3. Pusaka or Tulin\u2014belonging to the Sultan or any of the nobles in their unofficial capacity.\n\nThe crown and the feudal chiefs did not assert any claim to the land; there are, for instance, no \"crown lands,\" and, in the case of land not owned or occupied, any native could settle upon and cultivate it without payment of any rent or land tax, either to the Sultan or to the feudal chief of the district; consequently, land was comparatively little regarded, and what the feudal chief claimed was the people and not the land, so much so that, as pointed out by Mr. P. Leys in a Consular report, in the case of the people removing from one river to another, they did not become the followers of the chief who owned the population amongst whom they settled, but remained subject to their former lord, who had the right of following them and collecting from them his taxes as before. It is only of quite recent years, imitating the example of the English in Labuan, where all the land was assumed to be the property of the Sovereign and leased to individuals for a term of years, that the nobles have, in some instances, put forward a claim to ownership of the land on which their followers\n\n* Owing to the absence of roads and the consequent importance of rivers as means of getting about, nearly all districts in Borneo are named after their principal river.\nchose to settle, and have endeavoured to pose as semi-independent princes. These feudal chiefs tax, or used to tax, their followers in proportion to their inability to resist their lords' demands. A poll tax, usually at the rate of $2 for married men and $1 for bachelors, is a form of taxation to which, in the absence of any land tax, no objection is made, but the chiefs had also the power of levying special taxes at their own sweet will, when they found their expenditure in excess of their income, and advantage was taken of any delay in payment of taxes, or of any breach of the peace, or act of theft occurring in a district, to impose excessive fines on the delinquents, all of which if paid went to the chief; and if the fine could not be paid, the defaulter's children might be seized and eventually sold into slavery. The system of \"forced trade\" I have alluded to when speaking on the subject of domestic slavery. The chiefs were all absentees and, while drawing everything they could out of their districts, did nothing for their wretched followers. The taxes were collected by their messengers and slaves, unscrupulous men who were paid by what they could get out of the people in excess of what they were bidden to demand, and who, while engaged in levying the contributions, lived at free quarters on the people, who naturally did their best to expedite their departure. Petty cases of dispute were settled by headmen appointed by the chief and termed orang kaya, literally \"rich men.\" These orang kayas were often selected from their possessing some little property and being at the same time subservient to the chief. In many cases, it seemed to me, that they were chosen for their superior stupidity and pliability. I have made use of the past tense throughout my description of these feudal chiefs as, happily, for reasons already given, the \"good old times\" are rapidly passing away.\n\nThe laws of Brunai are, in theory, those inculcated by the Kor\u00e1n and there are one or two officials who have some slight knowledge of Mahomedan law. Owing to the cheap facilities offered by the numerous steamers at Singapore, there are many Hajis\u2014that is, persons who have made the pilgrimage to Mecca\u2014amongst the Brunais and the Kadaaans, amongst\nthe latter more especially, but of course a visit to Mecca does not necessarily imply that the pilgrim has obtained any actual knowledge of the holy book, which some of them can decipher, the Malays having adopted the Arabic alphabet, but without, however, understanding the meaning of the Arabic words of which it consists. A friend of mine, son of the principal exponent of Mahomedan law in the capital, and who became naturalised as a British subject, had studied law in Constantinople.\n\nThere is no gaol in Brunai, and fines are found to be a more profitable mode of punishment than incarceration, the judge generally pocketing the fine, and when it does become necessary to keep an offender in detention, it is done by placing his feet in the stocks, which are set up on the public staging or landing before the reception room of the Sultan, or of one of his chief Ministers, and the wretched man may be kept there for months.\n\nThe punishment for theft, sanctioned by the Kor\u00e1n, is by cutting off the right hand, but this barbarous, though effective, penalty has been discountenanced by the English. On one occasion, however, when acting as H. B. M. Consul-General, I received my information too late to interfere. I had been on a visit to the late Sultan in a British gunboat, and anchored off the palace. During the evening, just before dinner, notwithstanding the watch kept on deck, some natives came alongside and managed to hook out through the ports my gold watch and chain from off the Captain's table, and the first Lieutenant's revolver from his cabin. During our interview next morning with the Sultan, I twittered him on the skill and daring of Brunai thieves, who could perpetrate a theft from a friendly war-ship before the windows of the Royal palace. The Sultan said nothing, but was evidently much annoyed, and a few weeks afterwards the revolver and the remains of my watch and chain were sent to me at Labuan, with a letter saying that three thieves had been punished by having had their hands chopped off. I subsequently heard that two of the unfortunate men had died from the effects of this cruel punishment.\nOn another occasion, some Brunai thieves skilfully dismounted and carried off two brass signal guns from the poop of a merchant steamer at anchor in the river, eluding the vigilance of the quarter-master, while the skipper and some of the officers were asleep on the skylight close by. The guns were subsequently recovered.\n\nExecution is either by means of the bow string or the kris.\n\nI had once the unpleasant duty of having to witness the execution by the bow string of a man named Maidin, as it was feared that, being the son of a favourite officer of the Sultan, the execution might be a sham one. This man, with others, had raided a small settlement of Chinese traders from Labuan on the Borneo coast, killing several of the shop-keepers and looting the settlement. So weak was the central government, and so little importance did they attach to the murder of a few Chinese, that, notwithstanding the efforts of the British Consul, Maidin remained at liberty for nearly two years after the commission of the crime.\n\nThe execution took place at night. The murderer was bound, with his hands behind his back, in a large canoe, and a noose of rope was placed round his neck. Two men stood behind him; a short stick was inserted in the noose and twisted round and round by the two executioners, thereby causing the rope to compress the windpipe. Maidin's struggles were soon over.\n\nIn the case of common people the kris is used, the executioner standing behind the criminal and pressing the kris downwards, through the shoulder, into the heart. This mode of execution has been retained by the European rulers of Sarawak. In British North Borneo the English mode by hanging has been adopted.\n\nFormerly, when ancient customs were more strictly observed, any person using insulting expressions in talking of members of the Royal family was punished by having his tongue slit, and I was once shewn by the Temenggong, in whose official keeping it was, the somewhat cumbrous pair of scissors wherewith this punishment was inflicted, but I have never heard of its having been used during the last twenty years,\nalthough opportunities could not have been wanting.\n\nI was once horrified by being informed by an observant British Naval Officer, who had been to Brunei on duty, that he had been disgusted by noticing, notwithstanding our long connection with Brunei and supposed influence with the Sultan, so barbarous a mode of execution as that of keeping the criminal exposed, without food, day and night, on a stage on high posts in the river. I had never heard of this process, and soon discovered that my friend had mistaken men fishing, for criminals undergoing execution. Two men perch themselves up on posts, some distance apart, and let down by ropes a net into the river. Waiting patiently\u2014and Brunais can sit still contentedly doing nothing for hours\u2014they remain motionless until a shoal of fish passes over the net, when it is partially raised and the fish taken out by a third man, and the operation repeated.\n\nI do not think my naval friend ever published his Brunei reminiscences.\n\nI have already said there is no police force in Brunei; an official makes use of his own slaves to carry out his orders, where an European would call in the police. Neither is there any army and navy, but the theory is that the Sultan and Ministers can call on the Brunei people to follow them to war, but as they give neither pay nor sufficient food their call is not numerously responded to.\n\nEvery Brunei man has his own arms, spear, kris and buckler, supplemented by an old English \"Tower\" musket, or rifle, or by one of Chinese manufacture with an imitation of the Tower mark. The parang, or chopper, or cutlass, is always carried by a Malay, being used for all kinds of work, agricultural and other, and is also a useful weapon of offence or defence.\n\nBrunei is celebrated for its brass cannon foundries and still produces handsome pieces of considerable size. Pigafetta describes cannon as being frequently discharged at Brunei during his visit there in 1521. Brass guns were formerly part of the currency in Brunei and, even now, you often hear the price of an article given as so many pikuls (a pikul=\n133\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)lbs), or catties (a catty=\\(1\\frac{1}{3}\\)lbs) of brass gun. The brass for the guns is chiefly furnished by the Chinese cash, which is current in the town.\n\nIn former days, in addition to brass guns, pieces of grey shirting (*belachu*) and of Nankin (*kain asap*) and small bits of iron were legal tender, and I have seen a specimen of a Brunei copper coinage one Sultan tried to introduce, but it was found to be so easily imitated by his subjects that it was withdrawn from circulation. At the present day silver dollars, Straits Settlements small silver pieces, and the copper coinage of Singapore, Sarawak and British North Borneo all pass current, the copper, however, unfortunately predominating. Recently the Sultan obtained $10,000 of a copper coin of his own from Birmingham, but the traders and the Governments of Singapore and Labuan appear to have discountenanced its use, and he probably will not try a second shipment.\n\nThe profit on the circulation of copper coinage, which is only a token, is of course considerable, and the British North Borneo Company obtained a substantial addition to its revenue from the large amount of its coin circulated in Brunei. When the Sultan first mooted the idea of obtaining his own coin from England, one of the Company\u2019s officers expostulated feelingly with him, and I was told by an onlooker that the contrast of the expressions of the countenances of the immobile Malay and of the mobile European was most amusing. All that the Sultan replied to the objections of the officer was \u201cIt does not signify, Sir, my coin can circulate in your country and yours can circulate in mine,\u201d knowing well all the time the profit the Company was making.\n\nThe inhabitants of the city of Brunei are very lightly taxed, and there is no direct taxation. As above explained, there is no land tax, nor ground rent, and every man builds his own house and is his own landlord. The right of retailing the following articles is \u201cfarmed\u201d out to the highest bidder by the Government, and their price consequently enhanced to the consumer:\u2014Opium (but only a few of the nobles use the drug), foreign tobacco, curry stuff, wines and spirits (not used by the natives), salt, gambier (used for chewing with the\nbetel or areca nut), tea (little used by the natives) and earth-nut and coco-nut oil. There are no Municipal rates and taxes, the tidal river acting as a self cleansing street and sewer at the same time; neither are there any demands from a Poor Law Board.\n\nOn the other hand, there being no Army, Navy, Police, nor public buildings to keep up, the expenses of Government are wonderfully light also.\n\nOther Government receipts, in addition to the above, are rent of Chinese house-boats or rather shop-boats, pawn-broking and gambling licenses, a \"farm\" of the export of hides, royalties on sago and gutta percha, tonnage dues on European vessels visiting the port, and others. The salaries and expenses of the Government Departments are defrayed from the revenues of the rivers, or districts attached to them.\n\nConsiderable annual payments are now made by Sarawak and British North Borneo for the territorial cessions obtained by them. The annual contribution by Sarawak is about $16,000, and by the British North Borneo $11,800. These sums are apportioned amongst the Sultan and nobles who had interests in the ceded districts. I may say here that the payment by British North Borneo to the Sultan of the State, under the arrangement made by Mr. Dent already referred to, is one of $5,000 per annum.\n\nAn annual payment is also made by Mr. W. C. Cowie for the sole right* of working coal in the Sultanate, which he holds for a period of several years. Coal occurs throughout the island of Borneo, and its existence has long been known. It is worked on a small scale in Sarawak and in some portions of Dutch Borneo, and the unsuccessful attempts to develop the coal resources of the Colony of Labuan will be referred to later on.\n\nIn the Brunei Sultanate, with which we are at present concerned, coal occurs abundantly in the Brunei river and elsewhere, but it is only at present worked by Mr. Cowie and his partners at Muara, at the mouth of the Brunei river\u2014\n\n* This right was transferred by Mr. Cowie to Raja Brooke in 1883.\nMuara, indeed, signifying in Malay a river's mouth. The Revd. J. E. Tennison-Wood, well known in Australia as an authority on geological questions, thus describes the Muara coalfields:\u2014\u201cAbout twenty miles to the South-west of Labuan is the mouth of the Brunai river. Here the rocks are of quite a different character, and much older. There are sandstones, shales, and grits, with ferruginous joints. The beds are inclined at angles of 25 to 45 degrees. They are often altered into a kind of chert. At Muara there is an outcrop of coal seams twenty, twenty-five and twenty-six feet thick. The coal is of excellent quality, quite bitumenised, and not brittle. The beds are being worked by private enterprise. I saw no fossils, but the beds and the coal reminded me much of the older Australian coals along the Hunter river. The mines are of great value. They are rented for a few thousand dollars by two enterprising Scotchmen, from the Sultan of Brunai. The same sovereign would part with the place altogether for little or nothing. Why not have our coaling station there? Or what if Germany, France or Russia should purchase the same from the independent Sultan of Brunai?\u201d As if to give point to the concluding remarks, a Russian man-of-war visited Muara and Brunai early in 1887, and shewed considerable interest in the coal mines.*\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nThe fairest way, perhaps, of giving my readers an idea of what Brunai was and what it is, will be by quoting first from the description of the Italian Pigafetta, who was there in 1521, and then from that of my friend the late Mr. Stair Elphinstone Dalrymple, who visited the city with me in 1884. Pigafetta\u2019s description I extract from Crawford\u2019s Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian Islands.\n\n\u201cWhen,\u201d says he, \u201cwe reached the city, we had to wait two hours in the prahu (boat or barge) until there had arrived two elephants, caparisoned in silk-cloth, and twelve men, each\n\n* The British Protectorate has obviated the danger.\nfurnished with a porcelain vase, covered with silk, to receive and to cover our presents. We mounted the elephants, the twelve men going before, carrying the presents. We thus proceeded to the house of the Governor, who gave us a supper of many dishes. Next day we were left at our leisure until twelve o'clock, when we proceeded to the King's palace. We were mounted, as before, on elephants, the men bearing the gifts going before us. From the Governor's house to the palace the streets were full of people armed with swords, lances and targets; the King had so ordered it. Still mounted on the elephants we entered the court of the palace. We then dismounted, ascended a stair, accompanied by the Governor and some chiefs and entered a great hall full of courtiers. Here we were seated on carpets, the presents being placed near to us. At the end of the great hall, but raised above it, there was one of less extent hung with silken cloth, in which were two curtains, on raising which, there appeared two windows, which lighted the hall. Here, as a guard to the King, there were three hundred men with naked rapiers in hand resting on their thighs. At the farther end of this smaller hall, there was a great window with a brocade curtain before it, on raising which, we saw the King seated at a table masticating betel, and a little boy, his son, beside him. Behind him women only were to be seen. A chieftain then informed us, that we must not address the King directly, but that if we had anything to say, we must say it to him, and he would communicate it to a courtier of higher rank than himself within the lesser hall. This person, in his turn, would explain our wishes to the Governor's brother, and he, speaking through a tube in an aperture of the wall would communicate our sentiments to a courtier near the King, who would make them known to his Majesty. Meanwhile, we were instructed to make three obeisances to the King with the joined hands over the head, and raising, first one foot and then the other, and then kissing the hands. This is the royal salutation.\n\n* * *\n\nAll the persons present in the palace had their loins covered with gold embroidered cloth and silk, wore poiniards with golden hilts, orna-\nmented with pearls and precious stones, and had many rings on their fingers.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nWe remounted the elephants and returned to the house of the Governor. * * * * After this there came to the house of the Governor ten men, with as many large wooden trays, in each of which were ten or twelve porcelain saucers with the flesh of various animals, that is, of calves, capons, pullets, pea-fowls and others, and various kinds of fish, so that of meat alone there were thirty or two-and-thirty dishes. We supped on the ground on mats of palm-leaf. At each mouthful we drank a porcelain cupful, the size of an egg, of a distilled liquor made from rice. We ate also rice and sweetmeats, using spoons of gold, shaped like our own. In the place where we passed the two nights, there were always burning two torches of white wax, placed on tall chandeliers of silver, and two oil lamps of four wicks each, while two men watched to look after them. Next morning we came on the same elephants to the sea side, where forthwith there were ready for us two prahus, in which we were reconducted to the ships.\u201d Of the town itself he says:\u2014\u201cThe city is entirely built in the salt water, the King\u2019s house and those of some chieftains excepted. It contains 25,000 fires, or families. The houses are all of wood and stand on strong piles to keep them high from the ground. When the flood tide makes, the women, in boats, go through the city selling necessaries. In front of the King\u2019s palace there is a rampart constructed of large bricks, with barbacans in the manner of a fortress, on which are mounted fifty-six brass and six iron cannon.\u201d With the exception of the statement concerning the number of families, Mr. CRAWFORD considers PIGAFETTA\u2019s account contains abundant internal evidence of intelligence and truthfulness. I may be allowed to point out that, seeing only the King\u2019s house and those of some of the nobles were on terra firma, there could have been little use for elephants in the city and probably the two elephants PIGAFETTA mentions were the only ones there, kept for State purposes. It is a curious fact that though in its fauna Borneo\nmuch resembles Sumatra, yet, while elephants abound in the latter island, none are to be found in Borneo, except in a restricted area on the North-East Coast, in the territories of the North Borneo Company. It would appear, too, that the tenets of the Mahomedan religion were not strictly observed in those days. Now, no Brunai noble would think of offering you spirits, nor would ladies on any account be permitted to appear in public, especially if Europeans were among the audience. The consumption of spirits seems to have been on a very liberal scale, and it is not surprising to find Pigafetta remarking further on that some of the Spaniards became intoxicated. Spoons, whether of gold or other material, have long since been discarded by all respectable Brunais, only Pagans make use of such things, the Mahomedans employ the fingers which Allah has given them. The description of the women holding their market in boats stands good of to-day, but the wooden houses, instead of being on \"strong piles,\" now stand on ricketty, round nibong palm posts. The description of the obeisance to the King is scarcely exaggerated, except that it is now performed squatting cross-legged\u2014sila\u2014the respectful attitude indoors, from the Sanskrit \u00e7il, to meditate, to worship (for an inferior never stands in the presence of his superior), and has been dispensed with in the case of Europeans, who shake hands. Though the nobles have now comparatively little power, they address each other and are addressed by the commonalty in the most respectful tone, words derived from the Sanskrit being often employed in addressing superiors, or equals if both are of high rank, such as Baginda, Duli Paduka, Ianda, and in addressing a superior the speaker only alludes to himself as a slave, Amba, Sahaya. I have already referred to the prohibition of the use of yellow by others than the Royal family, and may add that it is a grave offence for a person of ordinary rank to pass the palace steps with his umbrella up, and it is forbidden to him to sit in the after part of his boat or canoe, that place being reserved for nobles. At an audience with the Sultan, or with one of the Wazirs, considerable ceremony is still observed. Whatever the time of the day, a thick bees' wax candle, about three\nfeet long is lighted and placed on the floor alongside the European visitor, if he is a person of any rank, and it is etiquette for him to carry the candle away with him at the conclusion of his visit, especially if at night. It was a severe test of the courteous decorum of the Malay nobles when on one occasion, a young officer, who accompanied me, not only spilt his cup of coffee over his bright new uniform, but, when impressively bidding adieu to H. H. the Sultan, stood for some time unconsciously astride over my lighted candle. Not a muscle of the faces of the nobles moved, but the Europeans were scarcely so successful in maintaining their gravity.\n\nMr. Dalrymple's description of Brunai, furnished to the Field in August, 1884, is as follows:\u2014\"On a broad river, sweeping round in an imposing curve from the South-Eastward, with abrupt ranges of sandstone hills, for the most part cleared of forest, hemming it in on either side, and a glimpse of lofty blue mountains towering skywards far away to the North-East, is a long straggling collection of atap (thatch made of leaves of nibong palm) and kajang (mats of ditto) houses, or rather huts, built on piles over the water, and forming a gigantic crescent on either bank of the broad, curving stream. This is the city of Brunai, the capital of the Yang di Pertuan, the Sultan of Brunai, atat one hundred or more, and now in his dotage: the abode of some 15,000 Malays, whose language is as different from the Singapore Malay as Cornish is from Cockney English, and the coign of vantage from which a set of effete and corrupt Pangerans extended oppressive rule over the coasts of North-West Borneo, from Sampanmangiu Point to the Sarawak River in days gone by, ere British enterprise stepped in, swept the Sulu and Illanun pirates from the sea, and opened the rivers to commercial enterprise.\n\nStanding on the summit of one of the above-mentioned hills, a fine bird's eye view is obtained of the city below. The ramshackle houses are all built in irregular blocks or clusters, but present on either side a regular frontage to the broad river, and following its sweeping curve, form two imposing crescent, divided by a fine water-way. Behind these main\ncrescents are various other blocks and clusters of buildings, built higgledy piggledy and without plan of any sort. On the true left bank are some Chinese shops built of brick, and on the opposite bank a brick house of superior pretensions and a waving banner proclaiming the abode of the Chinese Consular Agent of the British North Borneo Company.\n\nA heterogeneous collection of buildings on the right side of the upper part of the city forms the palace (save the mark!) of the Sultan himself. A little further down a large, straggling, but substantial plank building, with a corrugated iron roof, marks the abode of the Pangeran Temenggong, a son of the former Sultan and the heir apparent to the throne of Brunei. Two steam launches are lying opposite at anchor, one the property of the Sultan, the other belonging to the heir apparent.\n\nThe public reception room of the Sultan\u2019s palace is a long apartment with wooden pillars running along either side, and supporting a raised roof. Beyond these on either side, are lateral compartments. At the far end, in the centre of a kind of alcove, is the Sultan\u2019s throne. The floors are covered with matting.\n\nAlthough the glories of Brunei have departed, and it is only the shadow of what it was when Pigafetta visited it, a certain amount of state is still kept up on occasions. A boat comes sweeping down the river crowded with Malays, a white flag waving from its stern, seven paddles flashing on either side, and an array of white umbrellas midships. It is the Pangeran di Gadong coming in state to pay a ceremonial visit. As it sweeps alongside, the Pangeran is seen sitting on a gorgeous carpet, surrounded by his officials. One holds an umbrella over his head, while another holds aloft the tongkat kraidan, a long guilded staff, surmounted by a plume of yellow horse hair, which hangs down round it. The most striking point in the attire of the Pangeran and his Officers is the beauty of the krises with which they are armed, the handles being of carved ivory ornamented with gold, and the sheaths of beautifully polished wood, resembling satin wood. Cigars and coffee are produced, and a bichara ensues.\nQuakers' meeting is no bad metaphor to describe a Malay *bichara*. The Pangerans sit round in a circle smoking solemnly for some time, until a question is put to them, to which a brief reply is given, followed by another prolonged pause.\n\nIn this way the business on which they have come is gradually approached.\n\nTheir manners are as polished as their faces are immobile, and the way to a Malay's heart lies through his pocket.\n\nTo the outsider, Brunai is a city of hideous old women, for such alone are met with in the thronged market place where some hundreds of market boats jostle each other, while their inmates shriek and haggle over their bargains, or during a water promenade while threading the labyrinths of this Oriental Venice; but if acquainted with its intricacies, or if paying a ceremonial visit to any of the leading Pangerans, many a glimpse may be had of some fair skinned beauty peeping through some handy crevice in the *kajang* wall, or, in the latter case, a crowd of light-skinned, dark-eyed houris may be seen looking with all their might out of a window in the harem behind, from which they are privileged to peep into the hall of audience.\n\nThe present population of Brunai cannot exceed 12,000 to 15,000 souls, a great number having succumbed to the terrible epidemic of cholera a year ago. The exports consist of sago, gutta percha, camphor, india-rubber, edible birds' nests, gum dammar, etc., and what money there is in the city is almost entirely in the hands of the Chinese traders.\n\nIn the old days, when it enjoyed a numerous Chinese population, the surrounding hills were covered with pepper plantations, and there was a large junk trade with China. At present Brunai lives on her exports of jungle produce and sago, furnished by a noble river\u2014the Limbang, whose valley lies but a short distance to the Eastward. One great advantage the city enjoys is a copious supply of pure water, drawn from springs at the base of the hills below the town on the left bank of the river.\n\n\"Such is a slight sketch of Brunai of the Brunais. If the Pangerans are corrupt, the lower classes are not, but are law-\nabiding, though not industrious. And the day may yet come when their city may lift her head up again, and be to North Borneo what Singapore is to the straits of Malacca.\"\n\nThis description gives a capital idea of modern Brunai, and I would only observe that, from the colour of his flag and umbrellas the nobleman who paid the state visit must have been the Bandahara and not the Di Gadong.\n\nThe aged Sultan to whom Mr. Dalrymple refers was the late Sultan Mumim, who, though not in the direct line, was raised to the throne, on the death of the Sultan Omar Ali Saifudin, to whom he had been Prime Minister, by the influence of the English, towards whom he had always acted as a loyal friend. He was popularly supposed to be over a hundred years old when he died and, though said to have had some fifty wives and concubines, he was childless. He died on the 29th May, 1885, having previously, on the advice of Sir C. C. Lees, then British Consul-General, declared his Temenggong, the son of Omar Ali Saifudin to be his successor. The Temenggong ascended the throne, without any opposition, with the title of Sultan, but found a kingdom distracted by rebellion in the provinces and reduced to less than a fourth of its size when the treaty was made with Great Britain in 1847.\n\nI have said that there is no ground rent in Borneo, and that every one builds his own house and is his own landlord, but I should add that he builds his house in the kampong, or parish, to which, according to his occupation, he belongs and into which the city is divided. For instance, on entering the city, the first kampong on the left is an important one in a town where fish is the principal article of animal food. It is the kampong of the men who catch fish by means of bambu fishing stakes, or traps, described hereafter, and supply the largest quantity of that article to the market; it is known as the Kampong Pablat.\n\nNext to it is the Kampong Perambat, from the casting net which its inhabitants use in fishing. Another parish is called Membakut and its houses are built on firm ground, being principally the shops of Chinese and Klings. The last kam-\npong on this side is that of Burong Ping\u00e9, formerly a very important one, where dwelt the principal and richest Malay traders. It is now much reduced in size, European steamers and Chinese enterprise having altered entirely the character of the trade from the time when the old Brunai nakodahs (master or owner of a trading boat) would cruise leisurely up and down the coast, waiting for months at a time in a river while trade was being brought in. The workers in brass, the jewellers, the makers of gold brocade, of mats, of brass guns, the oil manufacturers, and the rice cleaners, all have their own kampongs, and are jealous of the honour of each member of their corporation. The Sultan and nearly all the chief nobles have their houses on the true left bank of the river, i.e., on the right bank ascending.\n\nThe fishing interest is an important one, and various methods are employed to capture the supply for the market.\n\nThe k\u00e9long is a weir composed of nets made of split bambu, fastened in an upright position, side by side, to posts fixed into the bed of the stream, or into the sand in the shallow water of a harbour. There are two long rows of these posts with attached nets, one much longer than the other which gradually converge in the deeper water, where a simple trap is constructed with a narrow entrance. The fish passing up or down stream, meeting with the obstruction, follow up the walls of the k\u00e9long and eventually enter the trap, whence they are removed at low water. These k\u00e9long, or fishing stakes as they are termed, are a well known sight to all travellers entering Malay ports and rivers. All sorts of fish are caught in this way, and alligators of some size are occasionally secured in them.\n\nThe rambat is a circular casting net, loaded with leaden or iron weights at the circumference, and with a spread sometimes of thirty feet. Great skill, acquired by long practice, is shewn by the fisherman in throwing this net over a shoal of fish which he has sighted, in such a manner that all the outer edge touches the water simultaneously; the weights then cause the edges of the circumference to sink and gradually close together, encompassing the fish, and the net is drawn\nup by a rope attached to its centre, the other end of which the fisherman had retained in his hand. The skill of the thrower is further enhanced by the fact that he, as a rule, balances himself in the bow of a small \"dug-out,\" or canoe, in which a European could scarcely keep his footing at all. The rambat can also be thrown from the bank, or the beach, and is used in fresh and salt water. Only small fish and prawns are caught in this way. Prawns are also caught in small kelongs with very fine split bambu nets, but a method is also employed in the Brunai river which I have not heard of elsewhere. A specially prepared canoe is made use of, the gunwale on one side being cut away and its place taken up by a flat ledge, projecting over the water. The fisherman sits paddling in the stern, keeping the ledged side towards the bank and leaning over so as to cause the said ledge to be almost level with the water.\n\nFrom the same side there projects a long bambu, with wooden teeth on its under side, like a comb, fastened to the stern, but projecting outwards, forwards and slightly upwards, the teeth increasing in length towards its far end, and as they sweep the surface of the water the startled prawns, shut in by the bank on one side, in their efforts to avoid the teeth of the comb, jump into the canoe in large quantities.\n\nI have described the method of using the dip net, or serambau, on page 42. Many kinds of nets are in use, one\u2014the pukat\u2014being similar to our seine or drag net.\n\nThe hook and line are also used, especially for deep sea fishing, and fish of large size are thus caught.\n\nA favourite occasional amusement is tuba fishing. The tuba is a plant the juice of which has strong narcotic properties. Bundles of the roots are collected and put into the bottom of the canoes, and when the fishing ground is reached, generally a bend in a river, or the mouth of a stream which is barred at low tide, water is poured over the tuba and the juice expressed by beating it with short sticks. The fluid, thus charged with the narcotic poison, is then baled out of the canoes into the stream and the surface is quickly covered by all sorts of fish in all stages of intoxication, the smaller ones\neven succumbing altogether to the poison.\n\nThe large fish are secured by spearing, amid much excitement, the eager sportsmen often overbalancing themselves and falling headlong into the water to the great amusement of the more lucky ones. I remember reading an account of a dignified representative of Her Majesty once joining in the sport and displaying a pair of heels in this way to his admiring subjects. The tuba does not affect the flesh of the fish, which is brought to the table without any special preparation.\n\nThe principal export from Brunai is sago flour. The sago palm is known to the natives under the name of rumbiah, the pith, after its first preliminary washing, is called lamantah (i.e., raw), and after its preparation for export by the Chinese, sagu. The botanical name is Metroxylon, M. Lxvis being that of the variety the trunk of which is unprotected, and M. Rumphi that of the kind which is armed with long and strong spikes, serving to ward off the attacks of the wild pigs from the young palm.\n\nThis palm is indigenous in the Malayan Archipelago and grows to the height of twenty to forty feet, in swampy land along the banks of rivers not far from the sea, but out of the reach of tidal influences. A plantation once started goes \"on for ever,\" with scarcely any care or attention from the proprietor, as the palm propagates itself by numerous off-shots, which take the place of the parent tree when it is cut down for the purpose of being converted into food, or when it dies, which, unlike most other palms, it does after it has once flowered and seeded, i.e., after it has attained the age of ten or fifteen years.\n\nIt can also be propagated from the seed, but these are often unproductive.\n\nIf required for food purposes, the sago palm must be cut down at its base before it begins to flower, as afterwards the pith or farina becomes dried up and useless. The trunk is then stripped of its leaves and, if it is intended to work it up at its owner's house, it is cut into convenient lengths and floated down the river; if the pith is to be extracted on the spot the trunk is split in two, longitudinally, and is found to\ncontain a mass of starchy pith, kept together by filaments of woody fibre, and when this is worked out by means of bambu hatchets nothing but a thin rind, the outer bark, is left. To separate the starch from the woody fibre, the pith is placed on a mat in a frame work over a trough by the river side; the sago washer then mounts up and, pouring fresh water over the pith, commences vigorously dancing about on it with his bare feet, the result being that the starch becomes dissolved in the water and runs off with it into the trough below, while the woody fibre remains on the mat and is thrown away, or, if the washer is not a Mahomedan, used for fattening pigs. The starch thus obtained is not yet quite pure, and under the name of lamantah is sold to Chinese and undergoes a further process of washing, this time by hand, in large, solid, wooden troughs and tubs. When sufficiently purified, it is sun-dried and, as a fine white flour, is packed in gunny bags for the Singapore market. At Singapore, some of this flour\u2014a very small proportion\u2014is converted into the pearl sago of the shops, but the greater portion is sent on direct to Europe, where it is used for sizing cloth, in the manufacture of beer, for confectionery, &c.\n\nIt will be seen that the sago palm thus affords food and also employment to a considerable number of both natives and Chinese and, requiring little or no trouble in cultivation, it is a perfect gift of the gods to the natives in the districts where it occurs. It is a curious fact that, though abounding in Sarawak, in the districts near Brunai and in the southern parts of British North Borneo on the West Coast, it seems to stop short suddenly at the Putatan River, near Gaya Bay, and is not found indigenous in the North nor on the North-East. Some time ago I sent a quantity of young shoots to a Chief living on the Labuk River, near Sandakan, on the East Coast, but have not yet heard whether they have proved a success.\n\nA nasty sour smell is inseparable from a sago factory, but the health of the coolies, who live in the factory, does not appear to be affected by it.\n\nThe Brunais and natives of sago districts consume a considerable quantity of sago flour, which is boiled into a thick,\ntasteless paste, called boyat and eaten by being twisted into a large ball round a stick and inserted into the mouth\u2014an ungraceful operation. Tamarind, or some very acid sauce is used to impart to it some flavour. Sago is of course cheaper than rice, but the latter is, as a rule, much preferred by the native, and is found more nutritious and lasting. Logan, in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago, calculates that three sago palms yield more nutritive matter than an acre of wheat, and six trees more than an acre of potatoes. The plantain and banana also flourish, under cultivation, in Borneo, and Mr. Burbidge, in his preface to the Gardens of the Sun, points out that it fruits all the year round and that its produce is to that of wheat as $133:1$, and to that of the potato as $44:1$. What a Paradise! some of my readers will exclaim. There can be no want here! I am sure the figures and calculations above quoted are absolutely correct, but I have certainly seen want and poverty in Borneo, and these tropical countries are not quite the earthly paradises which some old writers would have us believe. For our poor British \u201cunemployed,\u201d at any rate, I fear Borneo can never be a refuge, as the sun would there be more fatal than the deadly cold here, and the race could not be kept up without visits to colder climates. But if sago and bananas are so plentiful and so nourishing, as we are taught by the experts, it does seem somewhat remarkable, in this age of invention, that some means cannot be devised of bringing together the prolific food stores of the East and the starving thousands of the West.\n\nBoth before, during and after the day\u2019s work, the Malays, man and woman, boy and girl, solace and refresh themselves with tobacco and with the areca-nut, or the betel nut as, for some unexplained reason, it is called in English books, though betel is the name of the pepper leaf in which the areca-nut is wrapped and with which it is masticated.\n\nA good deal of the tobacco now used in Brunai is imported from Java or Palembang (Sumatra), but a considerable portion is grown in the hilly districts on the West Coast of North Borneo, in the vicinity of Gaya Bay, by the Muruts. It is unfermented and sun-dried, but has not at all a bad flavour.\nand is sometimes used by European pipe smokers. The Brunei Malays and the natives generally, as a rule, smoke the tobacco in the form of cigarettes, the place of paper being taken by the fine inner leaf of the *nipa* palm, properly prepared by drying. The Court cigarettes are monstrous things, fully eight inches long sometimes, and deftly fashioned by the fingers of the ladies of the harem.\n\nSome of the inland natives, who are unable to procure *nipa* leaf (*dahun kirei*), use roughly made wooden pipes, and the leaf of the maize plant is also occasionally substituted for the *nipa*. It is a common practice with persons of both sexes to insert a \"quid\" of tobacco in their cheek, or between the upper lip and the gum. This latter practice does not add to the appearance of a race not overburdened with facial charms. The tobacco is allowed to remain in position for a long time, but it is not chewed. The custom of areca-nut chewing has been so often described that I will only remind the reader that the nut is the produce of a graceful and slender palm, which flourishes under cultivation in all Malayan countries and is called by Malays *pinang*. It is of about the size of a nutmeg and, for chewing, is cut into pieces of convenient size and made into a neat little packet with the green leaf of the aromatic betel pepper plant, and with the addition of a little gambier (the inspissated juice of the leaves of the *uncaria gambir*) and of fine lime, prepared by burning sea shells. Thus prepared, the bolus has an undoubtedly stimulating effect on the nerves and promotes the flow of saliva. I have known fresh vigour put into an almost utterly exhausted boat's crew by their partaking of this stimulant.\n\nIt tinges the saliva and the lips bright red, but, contrary to a very commonly received opinion, has no effect of making the teeth black. This blackening of the teeth is produced by rubbing in burnt coco-nut shell, pounded up with oil, the dental enamel being sometimes first filed off. Toothache and decayed teeth are almost unknown amongst the natives, but whether this is in some measure due to the chewing of the areca-nut I am unable to say.\n\nIt used to be a disagreeable, but not unusual sight, to see\nthe old Sultan at an audience remove the areca-nut he had been masticating and hand it to a small boy, who placed it in his mouth and kept it there until the aged monarch again required it.\n\nThe clothing of the Brunai Malays is simple and suitable to the climate. The one garment common to men, women and children is the sarong, which in its general signification means a sheath or covering, e.g., the sheath of a sword is a sarong, and the envelope enclosing a letter is likewise its sarong. The sarong or sheath of the Brunai human being is a piece of cotton cloth, of Tartan pattern, sewn down the side and resembling an ordinary skirt, or petticoat, except that it is not pleated or attached to a band at the waist and is, therefore, the same width all the way down. It is worn as a petticoat, being fastened at the waist sometimes by a belt or girdle, but more often the upper part is merely twisted into its own folds. Both men and women frequently wear nothing but this garment, the men being naked from the waist up, but the women generally concealing the breasts by fastening the sarong high up under the arms; but for full dress the women wear in addition a short sleeved jacket of dark blue cotton cloth, reaching to the waist, the tight sleeves being ornamented with a row of half-a-dozen jingling buttons, of gold if possible, and a round hat of plaited pandan (screw-pine) leaves, or of nipia leaf completes the Brunai woman's costume. No stockings, slippers, or shoes are worn. Ladies of rank and wealth substitute silk and gold brocade for the cotton material used by their poorer sisters and, in lieu of a hat, cover their head and the greater part of the face with a selendang, or long scarf of gold brocade. They occasionally also wear slippers. The gold brocade is a specialty of Brunai manufacture and is very handsome, the gold thread being woven in tasteful patterns on a ground of yellow, green, red or dark blue silk. The materials are obtained from China. The cotton sarongs are also woven in Brunai of European cotton twist, but interior and cheap imitations are now imported from Switzerland and Manchester. In addition to the sarong, the Brunai man, when fully dressed, wears a pair of loose cotton trowsers, tied round\nthe waist, and in this case the sarong is so folded as to reach only half way down to the knee, instead of to the ankle, as ordinarily.\n\nA short sleeved cotton jacket, generally white, covers his body and his head dress is a small coloured kerchief called dastar, the Persian word for turban.\n\nThe nobles wear silks instead of cottons and with them a small but handsome kris, stuck into the sarong, is de rigueur for full dress. A gold or silver betel-nut box might almost be considered as part of the full dress, as they are never without one on state occasions, it being carried by an attendant.\n\nThe women are fond of jewellery, and there are some clever gold and silversmiths in the city, whose designs appear to be imitated from the Javanese. Rings, earrings, broaches to fasten the jacket at the neck, elaborate hairpins, massive silver or gold belts, with large gold buckles, and bracelets of gold or silver are the usual articles possessed by a lady of position.\n\nThe characteristic earring is quite a specialty of Brunai art, and is of the size and nearly the shape of a very large champagne cork, necessitating a huge hole being made for its reception in the lobes of the ear. It is made hollow, of gold or silver, or of light wood gilt, or sometimes only painted, or even quite plain, and is stuck, lengthwise, through the hole in the ear, the ends projecting on either side. When the ladies are not in full dress, this hole occasionally affords a convenient receptacle for the cigarette, or any other small article not in use for the time being.\n\nThe men never wear any jewellery, except, perhaps, one silver ring, which is supposed to have come from the holy city\u2014Mecca.\n\nThe Malay kris is too well known to need description here. It is a dagger or poignard with a blade varying in length from six inches to two feet. This blade is not invariably wavy, or serpentine, as often supposed, but is sometimes quite straight. It is always sharp on both edges and is fashioned from iron imported from Singapore, by Brunai artificers. Great\ntaste is displayed in the handle, which is often of delicately carved ivory and gold, and just below the attachment of the handle, the blade is broadened out, forming a hilt, the under edge of which is generally fancifully carved. Age adds greatly to the value of the kris and the history of many is handed down. The highest price I know of being given for a Brunai kris was $100, paid by the present Sultan for one he presented to the British North Borneo Company on his accession to the throne, but I have heard of higher prices being asked. Very handsomely grained and highly polished wood is used for the sheath and the two pieces forming it are frequently so skilfully joined as to have the appearance of being in one. Though naturally a stabbing weapon, the Malays of Brunai generally use it for cutting, and after an amok the blade employed is often found bent out of all shape.\n\nThe parang is simply an ordinary cutlass, with a blade two feet in length. As we generally carry a pocket knife about with us, so the Brunai Malay always wears his parang, or has it near at hand, using it for every purpose where cutting is required, from paring his nails to cutting the posts of which his house is built, or weeding his patch of rice land.\n\nWith this and his bliong he performs all his carpentry work; from felling the enormous timber tree in the jungle to the construction of his house and boat. The bliong is indeed a most useful implement and can perform wonders in the hands of a Malay. It is in the shape of a small adze, but according to the way it is fitted into the handle it can be used either as an axe or adze. The Malays with this instrument can make planks and posts as smooth as a European carpenter is able to do with his plane.\n\nThe parang ilang is a fighting weapon, with a peculiarity in the shape of the blade which, Dr. Taylor informs me, is not known to occur in the weapons of any other country, and consists in the surface of the near side being flat, as in an ordinary blade, while that of the off side is distinctly convex. This necessitates rather careful handling in the case of a novice, as the convexity is liable to cause the blade to glance off any hard substance and inflict a wound on its wielder.\nThis weapon is manufactured in Brunai, but is the proper arm of the Kyans and, now, also of the Sarawak Dyaks, who are closely allied to them and who, in this as in other matters, such as the curious perforation of a part of their person, which has been described by several writers, are following their example. The Kyans were once the most formidable Sub-Malay tribe in Northern Borneo and have been alluded to in preceding pages. On the West coast, their headquarters is the Baram River, which has recently been added to Sarawak, but they stretch right across to the East Coast and Dutch territory.\n\nThere are many kinds of canoes, from the simple dug-out, with scarcely any free-board, to the *pakerangan*, a boat the construction of which is confined to only two rivers in North Borneo. It is built up of planks fastened together by wooden pegs, carvel fashion, on a small keel, or *lunas*. It is sharp at both ends, has very good lines, is a good sea boat and well adapted for crossing river bars. It is not made in Brunai itself, but is bought from the makers up the coast and invariably used by the Brunai fishermen, who are the best and most powerful paddlers to be found anywhere. The trading boats\u2014*prahus* or *tongkangs*\u2014are clumsy, badly fastened craft, not often exceeding 30 tons burthen, and modelled on the Chinese junk, generally two-masted, the foremast raking forward, and furnished with rattan rigging and large lug sails. This forward rake, I believe, was not unusual, in former days, in European craft, and is said to aid in tacking. The natives now, however, are getting into the way of building and rigging their boats in humble imitation of the Europeans. The *prahus* are generally furnished with long sweeps, useful when the wind falls and in ascending winding rivers, when the breeze cannot be depended on. The canoes are propelled and steered by single-bladed paddles. They also generally carry a small sail, often made of the remnants of different gaily coloured garments, and a fleet of little craft with their gaudy sails is a pleasing sight on a fresh, bright morning. At the sports held by the Europeans on New Year's Day, the Queen's Birthday and other festivals, native\ncanoe races are always included and are contested with the keenest possible excitement by the competitors. A Brunai Malay takes to the water and to his tiny canoe almost before he is able to walk. Use has with him become second nature and, really, I have known some Brunai men paddle all day long, chatting and singing and chewing betel-nut, as though they felt it no exertion whatever.\n\nIn the larger canoes one sees the first step towards a fixed rudder and tiller, a modified form of paddle being fixed securely to one side of the stern, in such a way that the blade can be turned so as either to have its edges fore and aft, or its sides presented at a greater or less angle to the water, according to the direction in which it is desired to steer the boat.\n\nI was much interested, in going over the Pitt-Rivers collection, at the Oxford University Museum, to find that in the model of a Viking boat the steering gear is arranged in almost exactly the same manner as that of the modern Malay canoe; and indeed, the lines generally of the two boats are somewhat alike.\n\nTo the European novice, paddling is severe work, more laborious than rowing; but then a Brunai man is always in \"training,\" more or less; he is a teetotaller and very temperate in eating and drinking; indeed the amount of fluid they take is, considering the climate, wonderfully small. They scarcely drink during meals, and afterwards, as a rule, only wash their mouths out, instead of taking a long draught like the European.\n\nMr. Dalrymple is right in saying that a State visit is like a Quakers' meeting. Seldom is any important business more than broached on such an occasion; the details of difficult negotiations are generally discussed and arranged by means of confidential agents, who often find it to their pecuniary advantage to prolong matters to the limit of their employer's patience. The Brunai Malays are very nice, polite fellows to have to deal with, but they have not the slightest conception of the value of time, and the expression nanti dahulu (wait a bit) is as often in their mouths as that of malua (by-and-by) is by Miss Gordon Cumming said to be in those of the Fijians.\nA lady friend of mine, who found a difficulty in acquiring Malay, pronounced *nanti dahulu*, or *nanti dulu* as generally spoken, \"nancy doodle,\" and suggested that \"the nancy doodles\" could be a good name for \"the Brunai Malays.\"\n\nAs writing is a somewhat rare accomplishment, state documents are not signed but sealed\u2014\"chopped\" it is called\u2014and much importance is accordingly attached to the official seals or *chops*, which are large circular metal stamps, and the *chop* is affixed by oiling the stamps, blacking it over the flame of a candle and pressing it on the document to be sealed. The *chop* bears, in Arabic characters, the name, style and title of the Official using it. The Sultan's Chop is the Great Seal of State and is distinguished by being the only one of which the circumference can be quite round and unbroken; the edges of those of the Wazirs are always notched.\n\nBy the aboriginal tribes of Borneo, the Brunai people are always spoken of as *Orang Abai*, or Abai men, but though I have often enquired both of the aborigines and of the Brunais themselves, I have not been able to obtain any explanation of the term, nor of its derivation.\n\nAs already stated, the religion of the Brunais is Mahomedanism; but they do not observe its precepts and forms with any very great strictness, nor are they proselytisers, so that comparatively few of the surrounding pagans have embraced the religion of their conquerors.\n\nMany of their old superstitions still influence them, as, in the early days of Christianity, the belief in the old heathen gods and goddesses were found underlying the superstructure of the new faith and tinging its ritual and forms of worship. There still flourishes and survives, influencing to the present day the life of the Brunais, the old Spirit worship and a real belief in the power of evil spirits (*hantus*) to cause ill-luck, sickness and death, to counteract which spells, charms and prayers are made use of, together with propitiatory offerings. Most of them wear some charm to ward off sickness, and others to shield them from death in battle. If you are travelling in the jungle and desire to quench your thirst at a brook, your Brunai follower will first lay his *parang*, or cutlass in the bed\nof the stream, with its point towards the source, so that the Spirit of the brook shall be powerless to harm you.\n\nIn caves and on small islands you frequently find platforms and little models of houses and boats\u2014propitiatory offerings to hantus. In times of general sickness a large model of a boat is sometimes made and decked with flags and launched out to sea in the hope that the evil spirit who has brought the epidemic may take his departure therein. At Labuan it was difficult to prevail on a Malay messenger to pass after sunset by the gaol, where executions took place, or by the churchyard, for fear of the ghosts haunting those localities.\n\nJavanese element, and Hindu work in gold has been discovered buried in the island of Pappan, situated between Labuan and Brunei. Mr. INCHE MAHOMET, H. B. M.'s Consular Agent in Brunei, was good enough to procure for me a native history of Brunei, called the Telselah Besar, or principal history. This history states that the first Mahomedan Sovereign of Brunei was Sultan MAHOMET and that, before his conversion and investiture by the Sultan of Johor, his kingdom had been tributary to the State of Majapahit, on the fall of which kingdom the Brunei Government transferred its allegiance to Johor. Majapahit* was the last Javanese kingdom professing Hinduism, and from its overthrow dates the triumph of Mahomedanism in Java. This occurred in A.D. 1478, which, if the chronicle can be trusted, must have been about the period of the commencement of the Mahomedan period in Brunei. Inclusive of this Sultan MAHOMET and of the late Sultan MUMIM, who died in May, 1885, twenty-three Mahomedan Sultans have reigned in Brunei and, allowing eighteen years for an average reign, this brings us within a few years of the date assigned to the overthrow of the kingdom of Majapahit, and bears testimony to the reliability of the chronicle. I will quote the first few paragraphs of the Telselah, as they will give the reader an idea of a Brunei history and also because they allude to the connection of the Chinese with Borneo and afford a fanciful explanation of the origin of the name of the mountain of\n\n* CRAWFORD'S Dictionary\u2014Indian Islands\u2014Majapait.\nKinabalu, in British North Borneo, which is 13,700 feet in height:\u2014\u201cThis is the genealogy of all the R\u00e1jas who have \u201coccupied the royal throne of the Government of Brunai, the \u201cabode of peace, from generation to generation, who inherited \u201cthe royal drum and the bell, the tokens from the country of \u201cJohore, kamal almakam, and who also possessed the royal \u201cdrum from Menangkabau, namely, from the country of Sagun-\u201ctang.\n\n\u201cThis was the commencement of the kingdom of Brunai and \u201cof the introduction of the Mahomedan religion and of the \u201cCode of Laws of the prophet, the beloved of God, in the \u201ccountry of Brunai\u2014that is to say (in the reign of) His High-\u201cness Sultan MAHOMET. But before His Majesty\u2019s time the \u201ccountry of Brunai was still infidel, and a dependency of \u201cMajapahit. On the death of the Batara of Majapahit and of \u201cthe PATIH GAJA MEDAH the kingdom of Majapahit fell, and \u201cBrunai ceased to pay tribute, which used to consist of one \u201cjar of the juice of the young betel-nut every year.\n\n\u201cIn the time of the Sultan BAHTRI of the kingdom of Johor, \u201cTuan ALAK BETATAR and PATIH BERBAHI were summoned \u201cto Johor, and the former was appointed Sultan MAHOMET \u201cby the Sultan of Johor, who conferred on him the royal \u201cdrum and assigned him five provinces, namely, Kaluka, Seri-\u201cbas, Sadong, Samarahan and Sarawak. PATIH BERBAI was \u201cgiven the title of Bandhara Sri Maharaja. After a stay of \u201csome little time in Johor, His Highness the Sultan MAHOMET \u201creturned to Brunai; but His Highness had no male issue and \u201conly one daughter. At that time also the Emperor of China \u201cordered two of his ministers to obtain possession of the pre-\u201ccious stone of the dragon of the mountain Kinabalu. \u201cNumbers of Chinese were devoured by the dragon and still \u201cpossession was not obtained of the stone. For this reason \u201cthey gave the mountain the name of Kinabalu (Kina= \u201cChinese; balu=widow).\n\n\u201cThe name of one of the Chinese Ministers was ONG \u201cKANG and of another ONG SUM PING, and the latter had \u201crecourse to a stratagem. He made a box with glass \u201csides and placed a large lighted candle therein, and\n\"when the dragon went forth to feed, ONG SUM PING\n\"seized the precious stone and put the lamp in its place and\n\"the dragon mistook it for the precious stone. Having now\n\"obtained possession of the precious stone all the junks set\n\"sail for China, and when they had got a long way off from\n\"Kinabalu, ONG KANG asked ONG SUM PING for the stone,\n\"and thereupon a quarrel ensued between them. ONG KANG\n\"continued to press his demand for the precious stone, and\n\"ONG SUM PING became out of humour and sullen and refused\n\"to return to China and made his way back to Brunei. On\n\"arriving there, he espoused the Princess, the daughter of\n\"Sultan MAHOMET, and he obtained the title of Sultan\n\"AHAMAT.\n\n\"The Sultan AHAMAT had one daughter, who was remark-\n\"ably beautiful. It came to pass that a Sheriff named ALLI,\n\"a descendant of AMIR HASSAN (one of the grandchildren\n\"of the prophet) came from the country of Taif to Brunei.\n\"Hearing of the fame of the beauty of the Sultan's daughter,\n\"he became enamoured of her and the Sultan accepted him\n\"as his son-in-law and the Government of Brunei was hand-\n\"ed over to him by His Highness and he was styled Sultan\n\"BERKAT. He enforced the Code of Laws of the beloved\n\"of God and erected a mosque in Brunei, and, moreover,\n\"ordered the Chinese population to make a stone fort.\"\n\nThe connection of the Chinese with Brunei was an import-\nant event in Borneo history and it was certainly to them that\nthe flourishing condition of the capital when visited by\nPIGAFETTA in 1521 was due. They were the sole planters of\nthe pepper gardens, the monopoly of the trade in the produce\nof which the East India Company negotiated for in 1774,\nwhen the crop was reported to the Company to have been\n4,000 pikuls, equal to about 240 tons, valued on the spot at $17\\frac{1}{4}$\nSpanish dollars per pikul. The Company's Agent expressly\nreported that the Chinese were the only pepper planters,\nthat the aborigines did not plant it, and that the produce\nwas disposed of to Chinese junks, which visited the port\nand which he trusted would, when the exclusive trade in\nthis article was in the hands of the Company, be diverted\nfrom Brunai to Balambangan.\n\nThe station at this latter island, as already mentioned, was abandoned in 1775, and the English trade with Brunai appears soon afterwards to have come to an end.\n\nFrom extracts from the Journal of the Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences published in *The British North Borneo Herald* of the 1st October, 1886, the first mention of Brunai in Chinese history appears to be in the year 669, when the King of Polo, which is stated to be another name for Bunlai (corruption of \"Brunai\"), sent an envoy to Pekin, who came to Court with the envoy of Siam. Again, in the year 1406, another Brunai envoy was appointed, who took with him a tribute of the products of the country, and the chronicle goes on to say that it is reported \"that the present \"King is a man from Fukien, who followed CHENG HO when \"he went to this country and who settled there.\"\n\nThis account was written in 1618 and alludes to the Chinese shipping then frequenting Brunai. It is by some supposed that the northern portion of Borneo was the destination of the unsuccessful expedition which KUBLAI KHAN sent out in the year 1292.\n\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century a Government seems to have arisen in Brunai which knew not ONG SUM PING and, in 1809, Mr. HUNT reported that Chinese junks had ceased visiting Brunai and, owing no doubt to the rapacious and piratical character of the native Government, the pepper gardens were gradually deserted and the Chinese left the country. A few of the natives had, however, acquired the art of pepper cultivation, especially the Dusuns of Pappar, Kimanis and Bundu and when the Colony of Labuan was founded, 1846, there was still a small trade in pepper with those rivers. The Brunai R\u00e1jas, however, received their revenues and taxes in this commodity and their exorbitant demands gradually led to the abandonment of its cultivation.\n\nThese rivers have since passed under the Government of the British North Borneo Company, and in Bundu, owing partly to the security now afforded to life and property and partly to the very high price which pepper at present realizes\non account of the Dutch blockade of Achin\u2014Achin having been of late years the principal pepper-growing country\u2014the natives are again turning their attention to this article. I may remark here that the people of Bundu claim and shew evidence of Chinese descent, and even set up in their houses the little altar and joss which one is accustomed to see in Chinamen's shops. The Brunai Malays call the Chinese Orang Kina and evidence of their connection with Borneo is seen in such names as Kina-batangan, a river near Sandakan on the north-east coast, Kina-balui, the mountain above referred to, and Kina-benua, a district in Labuan. They have also left their mark in the very superior mode of cultivation and irrigation of rice fields on some rivers on the north-west coast as compared with the primitive mode practised in other parts of Northern Borneo. It is now the object of the Governments of Sarawak and of British North Borneo to attract Chinese to their respective countries by all the means in their power. This has, to a considerable extent, been successfully achieved by the present R\u00e1ja BROOKE, and a large area of his territory is now under pepper cultivation with a very marked influence on the public revenues. This subject will be again alluded to when I come to speak of British North Borneo.\n\nIt would appear that Brunai was once or twice attacked by the Spaniards, the last occasion being in 1645.* It has also had the honour in more recent times, of receiving the attentions of a British naval expedition, which was brought about in this wise. Sir James, then Mr. Brooke, had first visited Sarawak in 1839 and found the district in rebellion against its ruler, a Brunai R\u00e1ja named Muda Hassim, who, being a friend to the English, received Mr. Brooke with cordiality. Mr. Brooke returned to Sarawak in the following year and this time assisted Muda Hassim to put down the rebellion and finally, on the 24th September, 1841, the Malay R\u00e1ja\n\n* Captain Rodney Mundy, R.N., states that in 1846 he captured at Brunai ten large Spanish brass guns, the longest being 14 feet 6 inches, cast in the time of Charles III of Spain and the most beautiful specimens of workmanship he had ever seen. Charles III reigned between 1759 and 1788.\nretired from his position as Governor in favour of the Englishman.\n\nThe agreement to so transfer the Government was not signed without the application of a little pressure, for we find the following account of it in Mr. Brooke's Journal, edited by Captain Rodney Mundy, R. N., in two volumes, and published by John Murray in 1848:\u2014\u201cOctober 1st, 1841.\n\n\u201cEvents of great importance have occurred during the last month. I will shortly narrate them. The advent of the Royalist and Swift and a second visit from the Diana on her return from Brunei with the shipwrecked crew of the Sultana, strengthened my position, as it gave evidence that the Singapore authorities were on the alert, and otherwise did good to my cause by creating an impression amongst the natives of my power and influence with the Governor of the Straits Settlements. Now, then, was my time for pushing measures to extremity against my subtle enemy the arch-intriguer Makota.\u201d This Chief was a Malay hostile to English interest. \u201cI had previously made several strong remonstrances, and urged for an answer to a letter I had addressed to Muda Hassim, in which I had recapitulated in detail the whole particulars of our agreement, concluding by a positive demand either to allow me to retrace my steps by repayment of the sums which he had induced me to expend, or to confer upon me the grant of the Government of the country according to his repeated promises; and I ended by stating that if he would not do either one or the other I must find means to right myself. Thus did I, for the first time since my arrival in the land, present anything in the shape of a menace before the R\u00e1ja, my former remonstrances only going so far as to threaten to take away my own person and vessels from the river.\u201d Mr. Brooke's demand for an investigation into Makota's conduct was politely shelved and Mr. Brooke deemed \u201cthe moment for action had now arrived. My conscience told me that I was bound no longer to submit to such injustice, and I was resolved to test the strength of our respective parties. Repairing on board the yacht, I mustered my people, explain-\ned my intentions and mode of operation, and having loaded\nthe vessel's guns with grape and canister, and brought her\nbroadside to bear, I proceeded on shore with a detachment\nfully armed, and taking up a position at the entrance of the\nR\u00e1ja's palace, demanded and obtained an immediate audience.\nIn a few words I pointed out the villany of Makota, his\ntyranny and oppression of all classes, and my determination\nto attack him by force, and drive him from the country. I\nexplained to the R\u00e1ja that several Chiefs and a large body of\nSiniawan Dyaks were ready to assist me, and the only course\nleft to prevent bloodshed was immediately to proclaim me\nGovernor of the country. This unmistakeable demonstration\nhad the desired effect * * * None\njoined the party of Makota, and his paid followers were not\nmore than twenty in number.\n\nUnder the guns of the Royalist, and with a small body of\nmen to protect me personally, and the great majority of all\nclasses with me, it is not surprising that the negotiation pro-\nceeded rapidly to a favourable issue. The document was\nquickly drawn up, sealed, signed, and delivered; and on the\n24th of September, 1841, I was declared R\u00e1ja and Governor\nof Sarawak amidst the roar of cannon, and a general display\nof flags and banners from the shore and boats on the river.\"\n\nThis is a somewhat lengthy quotation, but the language\nis so graphic and so honest that I need make no apologies for\nintroducing it and, indeed, it is the fairest way of exhibiting\nMr. Brooke's objects and reasons and is, moreover, interest-\ning as shewing under what circumstances and conditions the\nfirst permanent English settlement was formed in Borneo.\n\nMr. Brooke concludes his account of his accession to the\nGovernment in words that remind us of another unselfish\nand modest hero\u2014General Gordon. He says:\u2014\"Difficulty\nfollowed upon difficulty; the dread of pecuniary failure, the\ndoubt of receiving support or assistance; this and much\nmore presents itself to my mind. But I have tied myself to\nthe stake. I have heaped faggots around me. I stand\nupon a cask of gunpowder, and if others bring the torch I\nshall not shrink. I feel within me the firm, unchangeable\n\"conviction of doing right which nothing can shake. I see\nthe benefits I am conferring. The oppressed, the wretched,\nthe outlawed have found in me their only protector. They\nnow hope and trust; and they shall not be disappointed while\nI have life to uphold them. God has so far used me as a\nhumble instrument of his hidden Providence; and whatever\nbe the result, whatever my fate, I know the example will\nnot be thrown away. I know it tends to a good end in His\nown time. He can open a path for me through all difficulties,\nraise me up friends who will share with me in the task,\nawaken the energies of the great and powerful, so that\nthey may protect this unhappy people. I trust it may be so:\nbut if God wills otherwise; if the time be not yet arrived; if it\nbe the Almighty's will that the flickering taper shall be\nextinguished ere it be replaced by a steady beacon, I submit,\nin the firm and humble assurance that His ways are better\nthan my ways, and that the term of my life is better in His\nhands than in my own.\" On the 1st August, 1842, this\ncession of Sarawak to Mr. Brooke was confirmed by His\nHighness Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin, under the Great Seal.\nMuda Hassim was the uncle of the Sultan, who was a sover-\neign of weak, vacillating disposition, at one time guided by\nthe advice of his uncle, who was the leader of the \"English\nparty,\" and expressing his desire for the Queen's assistance\nto put down piracy and disorder and offering, in return, to\ncede to the British the island of Labuan; at another following\nhis own natural inclinations and siding altogether with the\nparty of disorder, who were resolved to maintain affairs as\nthey were in the \"good old times,\" knowing that when the\nreign of law and order should be established their day and\ntheir power and ability to aggrandize and enrich themselves at\nthe expense of the aborigines and the common people would\ncome to an end. There is no doubt that Mr. Brooke him-\nself considered it would be for the good of the country that\nMuda Hassim should be raised to the throne and the Sultan\ncertainly entertained not altogether ill-founded dread that it was\nintended to depose him in the latter's favour, the more so as\na large majority of the Brunei people were known to be in his\ninterest. In the early part of 1845 Muda Hassim appears to have been in favour with the Sultan, and was publicly announced as successor to the throne with the title of Sultan Muda (muda=young, the usual Malay title for the heir apparent to the Crown), and the document recognising the appointment of Mr. Brooke as the Queen's Confidential Agent in Borneo was written in the name of the Sultan and of Muda Hassim conjointly, and concludes by saying that the two writers express the hope that through the Queen's assistance they will be enabled to settle the Government of Borneo.\n\nIn April, 1846, however, Mr. Brooke received the startling intelligence that in the December, or January previous, the Sultan had ordered the murder of his uncle Muda Hassim and of several of the Raja's brothers and nobles of his party, in all some thirteen Rajas and many of their followers. Muda Hassim, finding resistance useless, retreated to his boat and ignited a cask of powder, but the explosion not killing him, he blew his brains out with a pistol. His brother, Pangeran Budrudin, one of the most enlightened nobles in Brunai, likewise terminated his existence by an explosion of gunpowder. Representations being made to Sir Thomas Cochrane, the Admiral in command of the station, he proceeded in person to Borneo with a squadron of eight vessels, including two steamers. The Sultan, foreseeing the punishment that was inevitable, erected some well-placed batteries to defend his town. Only the two steamers and one sailing vessel of war, together with boats from the other vessels and a force of six hundred men were able to ascend the river and, such was the rotten state of the kingdom of Borneo Proper and so unwarlike the disposition of its degenerate people that after firing a few shots, whereby two of the British force were killed and a few wounded, the batteries were deserted, the Sultan and his followers fled to the jungle, and the capital remained at the Admiral's disposition. Captain Rodney Mundy, accompanied by Mr. Brooke, with a force of five hundred men was despatched in pursuit of His Highness, but it is needless to add that, though the difficulties of marching through a trackless country under a tropical downpour of\nrain were pluckily surmounted, it was found impossible to come up with the Royal fugitive. Negotiations were subsequently entered into with the Prime Minister, Pangeran Mumim, an intelligent noble, who afterwards became Sultan, and on the 19th July, 1846, the batteries were razed to the ground and the Admiral issued a Proclamation to the effect that hostilities would cease if the Sultan would return and govern lawfully, suppress piracy and respect his engagements with the British Government; but that if he persisted in his evil courses the squadron would return and burn down the capital. The same day Admiral Cochrane and his squadron steamed away. It is perhaps superfluous to add that this was the first and the last time that the Brunei Government attempted to try conclusions with the British, and in the following year a formal treaty was concluded to which reference will be made hereafter.\n\n(To be continued.)\nNOTES ON NAMES OF PLACES IN THE ISLAND OF SINGAPORE AND ITS VICINITY.\n\nERHAPS the following notes on some of the names of places in the island of Singapore and its immediate neighbourhood, may not be without interest to the readers of the Journal. In Singapore the population is continually changing and, as the old Malay inhabitants have for the most part died out or migrated, it is probable that, before very long, the names of places may become corrupted (as some already have been) almost beyond recognition. That this should be the case is not surprizing when we consider the various nationalities that have settled down in the island for purposes of trade and commerce, and how few and scattered are the remnants of the old Malay settlers and the remnants of the aboriginal \"Orang Laut.\" It will doubtless seem to Malay scholars to be superfluous to notice the meanings of some of the names, but my object has been to write for the information of those who, although they are not thoroughly conversant with Malay, yet are disposed to take an intelligent interest in the subject.\n\nI have confined myself in these notes to the names of places in the Settlement of Singapore, but I may perhaps instance two cases in which the names of places in Johor territory have become curiously corrupted. There is a place on the shores of the Old Straits near Lenduyong called Janggut Ma' Dudok. This figures in the Government map of the island (1885) as \"Jaman Dulu\" and in the charts as \"Jaman Dudu.\" Again, there is the point known to Malays as\nTanjong Penyusok, and to us from our school geographies as Point Roumania. In Keane's Eastern Geography it is called \"Romania,\" in the map of the Malay Peninsula (1887) \"Tanjong Rum\u00e9nia,\" and in the charts and Sailing Directions it is written indifferently as \"Ramunia\" and \"Rumania.\" There are dangerous shoals to the seaward of the point called by the same name, but the spelling varies in every instance. The fact of the matter is the name of Roumania, or whatever it is, is based on a misconception. There is an island called Pulau Rum\u00e9nia about two miles West of Tanjong Penyusok and opposite to it on the mainland is a large kampong called Kampong Rum\u00e9nia. The name applied to the point\u2014Ramunia, Roumania or Rumania\u2014is evidently a corruption of Rum\u00e9nia, and the name has been applied to a place to which it never belonged. Rum\u00e9nia is the well known fruit-bearing tree Bonea microphylla.\n\nAyer G\u00e9m\u00faruh\u2014\"babbling waters.\" G\u00e9m\u00faruh is from \"g\u00faroh.\"\n\nAyer S\u00e1mak. \"S\u00e1mak\" (or samar) is a kind of tree, the bark of which is used in dyeing and tanning.\n\nBajau\u2014\"a pirate.\" (From Battak \"Bajo\" an attack?)\n\nBatu Koyok. A patch of rocks near Pulau T\u00e9kong. \"Koyok\" or \"kuyu\" is \"a pariah dog.\"\n\nB\u011bdok or Sa-b\u011bdok\u2014\"the drum of a mosque.\"\n\nBerh\u00e1la K\u00e9ping. A curiously shaped rock at the entrance to S\u011blat Singki. \"Berh\u00e1la\"* (pronounced Ber\u00e1la) is \"an idol,\" and I am informed that \"K\u00e9ping\" is the Orang Laut pronunciation of \"K\u00e9ping,\" the numeral affix. This appendix of K\u00e9ping, however, is not very satisfactory, and it has been suggested to me by Mr. D. F. A. Hervey that it is probably \"K\u00e9ping,\" to guard, hence the name, the idol being supposed to watch the entrance to the strait.\n\nB\u011bting K\u00fasah\u2014\"the dangerous sand-bank.\" \"Kusah\" is a variant of \"Susah.\"\n\n* Note.\u2014\"Bern\u00e1ia\" is invariably corrupted on the charts into \"Varella,\" e.g., Varella Straits, to the South of Singapore, and Varella Island, off the Pahang Coast.\nBlukang\u2014a kind of fish.\n\nBuran Darat. The coral patch to the N.E. of Blakang Mati. \"Buran\" is a kind of sea-anemone of a light green colour and is eaten by the Chinese.\n\nBukit Gemia. Mount Imbeah in Blakang Mati. \"Gemia\" is the sago-palm, a variant of \"Rembia.\"\n\nBukit Serapong. \"Serapong\" is possibly from \"Apong\" \"drift wood,\" but the formation is doubtful.\n\nG\u00e9lang. This is probably the plant g\u00e9lang pasir (Portulaca oleracea). There is another plant, g\u00e9lang laut (Sesuvium postulacastrum).\n\nKalang, \"a roller, skid\" for launching vessels. The B\u00e9danda Kalang, a tribe of the Orang Laut, took their name from the river.\n\nKalang Puding. \"Puding\" is probably the shrub with variegated leaves (Justicia picta).\n\nKampong Glam. The glam tree (Melaleuca leucadendron).\n\nKampong Kopit. The village in Blakang Mati sometimes called S\u00e9lat Singki. \"Kopit\" = \"narrow, contracted.\"\n\nKampong Pangkalan Paku. \"Pangkalan\" (from \"Pangkal\") \"landing place;\" \"Paku\" = a generic name for fern.\n\nKampong Perm\u00e1tang. \"Perm\u00e1tang\" is \"rising ground,\" \"a long ridge\" derived from \"Batang.\"\n\nKampong Renggam. (1)\u2014\"Renggam\" or \"Ranggam\" a thorny plant growing on low land. Its fruit can be eaten, and ataps are sometimes made out of its leaves. The plant is like the K\u00e9lubi. (2)\u2014\"Renggam\" = an instrument for cutting padi.\n\nKandang Kerbau\u2014\"buffalo pen.\" Sometimes wrongly written \"Kampong Kerbau.\"\n\nKranji. A tree (Dialium indicum).\n\nL\u00e9bong Aceh. This is a hollow or cutting (\"l\u00e9bong\") in the sandy beach near Changi Point as if a large boat had been hauled up there. The story is that one of the AChinese ships that attacked Johor was beached there for repairs. Compare Mr. Hervey's note on \"Prigi Aceh,\" p. 168 of Journal No. 11.\nLoyang. \"Brass\" according to Favre. Perhaps the place is so called from the colour of the water.\n\nPasir P\u00e9l\u00e9kat, i.e., Pasir Orang P\u00e9l\u00e9kat. \"P\u00e9l\u00e9kat\" = Pulicat, the place in India.\n\nPasir Ris. Perhaps this is a contraction for Pasir Iris (\"iris\" = to shred). I have heard the word pronounced as Pas\u00edris by an old resident.\n\nPinang Rawang. \"Rawang\" is a \"swamp\" or \"quaking bog.\"\n\nPulau Ayer Chawan. Pulau Ayer Limau. Pulau Ayer Merbau. These three islands are close together. \"Chawan\" is \"a cup\" or \"basin;\" \"Merbau\" is a tree (Afzelia palembanica).\n\nPulau Blakang Mati = \"dead-back island,\" so called from the sterility of the soil on the hills.\n\nPulau Brani. Properly = \"Pulau Ayer Brani,\" as it is still written on the charts. The island is so called from a well at the top of the hill, the water of which was supposed to have potent qualities. There used to be a \"Kolam,\" or tank, formed out of the natural rock on the Tanjong Pagar side of the island which received the overflow from the well and in which people used to bathe. The remains of this tank can still be seen.\n\nPulau Bukum. \"Bukum\" is said to be the same as \"Hukum,\" and there is a tradition that the Raja used to try cases in the island, hence the name, probably through the intermediate form \"berhukum.\"\n\nPulau Damar Laut. \"Damar Laut\" is the tree \"Vatica russak.\" \"Damar Laut,\" however, is the name also given to another tree (Canarium).\n\nPulau Jong. \"Junk Island,\" a small island of a conical shape to the North of Pulau S\u00ebking and Pulau S\u00ebb\u00e1rok. The story is that Malay pirates one night attacked a Chinese junk, which was anchored where the island now is, and just as the Malays got alongside, the Nakhodah of the junk awoke. On seeing the pirates, through terror, he uttered such a frightful yell that the sea-spirit turned the junk into an island much to the consterna-\ntion of the Malays.\n\nPulau Khatib Bongsu. \"Khatib\" = \"a preacher,\" \"Bongsu\" = \"youngest-born,\" hence = the island of a person of that name. This name has been fearfully corrupted in charts and maps, figuring as \"Kitch Bungsee,\" \"Kita Bangsa,\" &c.\n\nPulau M\u011brambong. \"Rambong\" is the kind of basket used by Bugis in Singapore for carrying pine-apple in, but Mr. D. F. A. Hervey suggests that the name is probably derived from the plant called \"ambong-ambong,\" a seaside shrub with a white flower.\n\nPulau Mis\u011bm\u00fat. Derived from \"S\u011bm\u00fat\" (ants).\n\nPulau Misk\u00f3l. \"Misk\u00f3l\" is the larger kind of water-vessel made from the coco-nut shell, and has a narrow orifice. The \"Gayong\" is shallower and is the half shell. Compare T\u011brumbu Gayong, a shoal not far from the island. The ordinary form of the word is \"S\u011bkol\" and the \"Mi\" in this and the other word (Mis\u011bmut) would seem to be an affix peculiar to the bhasa Orang Laut.\n\nPulau P\u00e9sek. \"P\u00e9sek\" is a Bugis word meaning coins with holes in the middle. Compare \"Pitis\" and \"Pichis.\"\n\nPulau R\u011bnget. \"R\u011bnget\" is the sand-fly (agas-agas), and signifies \"mosquito\" in some aboriginal dialects. It is also the name of a fresh water shell.\n\nPulau S\u0103-Kijang Band\u00e9ra, S\u0103-Kijang P\u011bl\u011bpah = St. John's Island West and St. John's Island East, respectively. St. John's, as pointed out by Mr. W. E. Maxwell, is a corruption of \"Sa-Kijang.\" S\u0103-Kijang Band\u00e9ra is so called because there used to be a flagstaff there before it was moved to Mount Faber. In the map of the island (1885) \"Band\u00e9ra\" is corrupted with \"Berak\"! \"P\u011bl\u011bpah\" are the fronds of a palm. These islands are supposed to be two roe-deer at which the \"spear-reef\" (T\u011br\u00fambu S\u011bl\u00edg\u00ec) off Blakang Mati is being aimed.\n\nS\u0103-ranggong. \"Ranggong\" is a kind of bird about the size of the adjutant and its description is as follows:\u2014 Black on back and white on breast, neck long, bill\nlong and sharp, crest grey. The feet are not webbed.\n\nPulau S\u0113b\u016brus. \"S\u0113b\u016brus\" is a sort of fruit-bearing tree that grows in mangrove swamp.\n\nPulau S\u0113m\u016blun. \"S\u0113m\u016blun\" is the name of a tribe of the \"Orang Laut.\" The name is wrongly written as \"S\u0113mbilan\" on the Government Map (1885).\n\nPulau S\u016bber. \"Suber\" is a kind of tree out of the bark of which cord is made.\n\nPulau S\u016bdong. A beautiful little island surrounded by a coral reef. \"S\u016bdong\" is said to be the same as \"Tu-dong\" (a cover), so called from the shape of the island with the reef round it.\n\nPulau T\u0113kong. \"T\u0113kong\" = \"an obstacle\" so called because the island blocks the mouth of the Johor River.\n\nPulau Ubin. \"Ubin\" according to Favre is Javanese, and means \"squared stone.\" The island is so called from the granite quarries.\n\nSarang Rimau = \"The tiger's den.\" This is the western end of Blakang Mati, apparently the place where Fort Siloso now is. \"Sal\u00fasuh\" is a kind of herb used as a remedy in childbirth, but I have no idea how the fort came to be so called, as the Orang Laut of Kampong Kopit only know the place by the name of Sarang Rimau.\n\nS\u0113lat Singki. The narrow strait between Pulau Brani and Blakang Mati. The charts wrongly give the name to the S\u0113lat Pandan. \"Singki\" probably = \"S\u0113ngkil\" or \"Singkir\" = sharp-edged. At Penang the word means \"set on edge\" (of the teeth), hence perhaps it is metaphorically applied to the difficulties of the passage. \"S\u0113ngkil\" is also the name of a plant.\n\nS\u0113lat T\u0113brau. \"T\u0113brau\" is a kind of large fish.

HAUGHTON.\nStarted from Singapore in the Sea Belle at 4.45 p.m. on Saturday, the 17th August. Reached Pulau Tioman before daylight on the 18th. Put into a bay on the S.E. side of the island, but, owing to the heavy swell, had to go on to Nipah Bay on the western side.\n\nThe Island of Tioman is hilly, very rocky, and heavily wooded. We landed at Nipah Bay soon after 6 a.m., and returned on board soon after 9 a.m. At the spot where we landed there is a small Malay Settlement called Kampong Nipah. The beach is sandy, with a large admixture of coral detritus. Beyond high-water mark, the beach is covered with grass and a variety of plants, the most conspicuous being the Goat's-foot Convolvulus. Beyond the beach, and running parallel with the sea-line, is a creek twenty to thirty feet wide, discharging into the sea at the base of a hill about a couple of hundred yards to the south of where we landed. The ground commences to rise almost immediately behind this creek. The whole place is heavily wooded, and everywhere there crop up boulders, of all sizes and shapes, of granite. There are a good number of coco-nut trees, but they appear to have been badly attacked by beetles. There was one splendid grove of durian trees, and many others scattered about the kampong. I noticed also several lime-trees, one with a large number of unripe fruit on it.\n\nOf birds, mammals, reptiles and insects, I saw hardly anything. Of birds, I only saw one snipe (Tringoides hypoleucus),\nand a few specimens of the Eastern pied robin (*Copsychus musicus*). I heard some hornbills flying overhead, but could not see them, and so could not determine the species. I saw also a few pigeons, but could not obtain a shot. I only actually procured two specimens of the red-headed tailor-bird (*Sutorius ruficeps*), and two specimens of the common Malayan sunbird (*Cinnyris malaccensis*). These latter were moulting and not fit for preserving.\n\nOf mammals, I obtained one specimen of the common squirrel (*Sciurus atrodorsalis*), and I saw a few small bats, which I failed to obtain.\n\nI did not see any reptiles, and of insects the best thing I got was about a dozen specimens of a Caddis-fly (*Trichoptera sp.*?). These I obtained over a small stream that came down behind the village. The butterflies I observed were the common species of Singapore, the most common being *Papilio polytes* and *Danais vulgaris*. Of these, I obtained specimens, as well as a few small blues belonging to the *Lycenedix*.\n\nIn the stump of an old coco-nut tree examined by Mr. RIDLEY we obtained one perfect specimen of the coco-nut weevil (*Rhyacophilus ferrugeneus*), and a number of its cocoons, and a few cockroaches. Mr. RIDLEY, also obtained for me, from a stream up which he worked, some specimens of a small fresh-water shrimp.\n\nFlying about over the sea I noticed a number of terns (*Sterna melananchen*), a few gulls, probably the laughing gull (*Xena ridibunda*), and a noddy (*Anous stolidus*).\n\nSoon after getting on board we commenced to steam along the western side of the island, keeping close inshore. The appearance of the island was much the same throughout, being heavily wooded, with indications of existing or abandoned kampongs.\n\nWe arrived off Kwala Pahang in the afternoon, and went ashore soon after, and met Mr. RODGER and Mr. WISE.\n\nAlmost as soon as we landed, a drizzling rain set in, which continued more or less the whole time we were ashore, so that it was almost impossible to obtain any specimens. All I obtained was one tailor-bird and one edible-nest swiftlet.\n(Collocalia spodiopygia). I saw a number of other birds, but as they were all of the common species obtainable at any time in Singapore, I contented myself with merely noting their occurrence.\n\nAt 7.45 on the morning of Monday, the 19th, we started for Pekan, two boats being towed by the steam launch. The river was very winding and full of sand-banks, so that the journey took more than two hours. Immediately after breakfast, about 11 A.M., Mr. Ridley and I started to collect.\n\nThe country in the immediate vicinity of Pekan is quite flat, the plains being covered with short grass. Here and there the ground is more or less swampy, the swampy ground is everywhere covered with clumps of the palm from which the sticks known at \"Penang Lawyer\" is obtained. On the higher and drier ground, are larger or smaller patches of scrub or secondary jungle, and occasionally a Malay house, surrounded with plantain, durian, and other fruit trees, is met with. Far in the distance could be seen heavy forest, but within many miles of Pekan nearly all the larger forest has been felled.\n\nBirds and insects were not very numerous, and, as at Pulau Tioman, they appeared to be only of the commoner species found on the western side of the islands. The bird that was most numerous was the little white-headed finch (Munia maya). Of these I found several new nests, but Mr. Ridley was fortunate in finding one with four fresh eggs. The yellow-wattled myna (Eulabes javanensis) and the metallic starling (Caloruis chalybeus) were also common. I heard and saw at a distance several parties of the common Malayan hornbill (Hydrocissa convexa). Omar Khan, Government Peon, shot a specimen of the lesser serpent eagle (Spilornis baha), which he gave me for the Museum. Green pigeons were not uncommon, but seemed to consist of but one species (Osmotreron vernans). The above were the most noticeable birds, and I saw nothing else during our three days' stay in Pekan worth recording. I forgot to mention that the common Indian black raven or corby (Corvus macrorhynchos) was very common, and the maroon kite (Halias tur indus) was frequently seen.\nOn the evening of Tuesday, the 20th, I accompanied His Excellency across the river, landing a few miles above Pekan. The country here was flat, the soil sandy, and everywhere covered with bushes, and fringed with secondary jungle. Here the green pigeon (*O. vernans*) was very numerous, flying overhead, in parties of five to ten or more, back and forwards between the clumps of jungle. The best bird I obtained while at Pekan was a specimen of Raffles hawk owl (*Minox scutulata*). This bird had flown into the room the night before our arrival, and had been captured by Mr. OWEN. It had died during the night, and had been thrown away, but on hearing about it, I searched and found it. It was not injured as to its plumage, and has made a very fine specimen, the only one we at present have in the Museum.\n\nI obtained specimens of all the butterflies and other insects that I possibly could, but, as before mentioned, they were all of the common forms obtainable on the western side of Peninsula.\n\nAt 3.30 p.m. on Wednesday, the 21st, we left Pekan, and arrived off Tringganu early next morning. A delay occurred in landing, as a Dato had to be sent ashore to make arrangements for the reception of His Excellency the Governor. After breakfast we started, and on landing at the town Mr. RIDLEY and I started at once to look for collecting ground. The only bit of likely ground in sight was the hill on which the fort was placed, but we were not allowed to ascend this, so we crossed the river and landed on a narrow spit of sand, sparsely covered with vegetation, which consisted chiefly of the Madagascar periwinkle. Though apparently fair ground for botanizing, it yielded nothing zoologically. All I got was a rare butterfly (*Papilio clytia*) and a number of small bivalves that had been left stranded on the beach.\n\nThe town of Tringganu is very thickly populated, the number of women and children being remarkable. The women there and at Kelantan are not shy, and mingle freely with the men. At a small market that was being held, the sales were being conducted by women. I noticed in several places in the town large quantities of salted limes put out in the\nsun to dry, so this fruit is evidently largely produced. Coco-\nnuts, too, were numerous, and are largely exported to Siam.\nThe coco-nut trees from Tringganu northwards do not\nseem to be attacked by beetles. Fishing seems to be the\ngreat occupation of the place, and on the morning of our\narrival we passed through a fleet of over a hundred boats\nstanding out to sea, each boat having from eight to ten men.\nThe Chinese, of whom there are several hundred in the town,\nare kept to the further end of the town, and not allowed to\nmingle with the Mahomedan population.\n\nWe arrived off Kelantan early on the morning of the 23rd\n(Friday). Soon after anchoring, the Dato started in the\nsteam launch to make the necessary arrangements for the\nreception of His Excellency, but it was nearly dark before he\nreturned; in consequence we were detained the entire day on\nboard, and were unable to land. Being unable to land, we\nstarted dredging by dragging a bucket along the length of\nthe ship and then carefully washing the bucket-full of dark\ntenacious clay so obtained. A number of small shells were\nobtained, mostly dead, one fine specimen alive, of a beautiful\nstar-fish (*Ophiocoma* sp.?), but so brittle that, before it could\nbe safely stowed away in spirit, it had become imperfect.\nWe also got half-a-dozen specimens of a *Holothurus* or sea\nslug, small but apparently adult.\n\nAt 8 A.M. next morning (Saturday, 24th) His Excellency\nstarted for Kelantan, Mr. Ridley and I following in the\nwhale-boat very soon after. We sailed up the river, and first\nlanded at a kampong, but did not obtain much. We then\nlanded on a low sandy and marshy island, covered for the\nmost part with a sedge, in which I saw specimens of the white-\nbreasted water-hen (*Erythra ph\u00e6nicura*) and the banded rail\n(*Rallus striatus*), a small sedge warbler (*Costicola exilis*),\nand the lesser coucal (*Centrococcyx bengalensis*). I here\nalso got, on some small flowering shrubs, a number of\ngood insects, the best being a green fly (*Stilbum*) which\nwill not unlikely prove to be an undescribed species.\nAt present only two species of this genus are recorded from\nthese parts (*Stilbum splendidum* and *S. occulata*); and it is\nneither of these. I also obtained specimens of several species of wasps. After leaving the island, we proceeded a couple of miles further up the river, where there was a small kampong. The place looked, and proved, a good collecting-ground, both zoologically and botanically. The country was flat, chiefly paddy-land, but now dry, margined with strips of secondary forest, and, on the higher and drier parts, everywhere dotted with clumps of bamboo.\n\nThe first bird I got was a fine female of one of the serpent eagles (*Spilornis rutherfordi*). I also noticed a flock of the pink-breasted parroquet (*Palaeornis fasciatus*). Vultures (*Pseudogyps bengalensis*) were also common. A few Indian ravens were seen, but they were not so numerous as at Pekan. No snakes were seen here or at any other place visited, but at this kampong I shot two lizards\u2014one a species of *Varanus*, which I have not yet identified, and the other a burrowing lizard feeding on vegetable substances, and which will probably prove to be *Liolepis guttatus* or a closely-affined species. A few insects were obtained at this spot, but none calling for particular notice.\n\nKelantan differs considerably from Tringganu, in that at the latter place fishing seems to be the chief industry. The manufacture of sarongs, krisses, &c., is largely carried on, while to agriculture but small attention seems to be paid. At Kelantan it is different, the people being apparently chiefly agriculturists, paddy and coco-nuts being extensively grown, Indian corn and tobacco to a lesser extent, and such minor products as croton and castor-oil seeds are not overlooked. Buffaloes and cattle are numerous, and the sheep are sheep, not the miserable hybrid-looking animals called sheep in Tringganu and Pekan. Poultry is abundant, and fine large fowls cost about five cents each. Fishing is carried on to only a small extent, and sarongs, krisses, &c. are not made, these being imported from Tringganu. In Kelantan, as in Tringganu, the women, though Mahomedans, mingle freely with the men, and are not in the least shy. The inhabitants very markedly show the admixture of Siamese blood, and this is specially noticeable in the women, who are above the\naverage height of the Malays, some indeed being very tall, and men, women, and children, instead of, like the Malays, being shy, retiring, and silent, are vivacious, talkative, and rather forward.\n\nThe banks of the Kelantan River are very beautiful; the admixture of coco-nuts and clumps of bamboos, with stretches of bright green paddy, with a back ground of dark forest, makes a pretty picture. The coinage differs from Pahang, consisting only of the silver dollar and small circular tin coins, about the size of, but not so thick as a cent with a hole in the centre. Five hundred of these coins are the equivalent of a dollar. Copper cents, or the smaller silver parts of a dollar, are not accepted.\n\nGot back to the steamer about noon, and left in the afternoon for the Cheranting River, where we arrived at 8 A.M. the next morning (Sunday, the 25th).\n\nThe river is situated at the head of a fine bay, but is a miserably small stream, with its mouth completely blocked up with fallen trees, and with only sufficient water to float a dugout drawing but a few inches of water. Landed on the right bank just at the entrance of the stream, and stayed a short time on shore. Tracks of game, such as deer, pigs, tiger, and peacock, were numerous along the beach, but we did not actually see anything. I obtained two shore plover, which were interesting, shewing as they did the remains of the rufous breeding plumage. One was the larger shore plover (*\u00c6gialitis geoffroyi*), the other the lesser shore plover (*\u00c6gialitis mongola*). The most northern point where these birds have been found breeding is in Siberia, on the banks of the Yenesei.\n\nAfter lunch started for the Rumpin River, fifty miles south of Cheranting, and twenty to the north of the Endau River, the boundary between Johor and Pahang. Anchored about 7 P.M., off the mouth and about four miles from shore.\n\nOn Monday, the 26th, at 5.30 P.M., steamed close in to shore, and landed on the right bank, where a Police Station is being erected. His Excellency and Mr. Rodger proceeded up the river to the Settlement, about twenty minutes'\nsteam in the launch. This was quite the best collecting-ground I had met with; birds were numerous, and the sandy soil round the new station was full of the burrowing lizards (*Lioplepis*). I obtained six fine specimens. Of birds, I got four specimens of the beautiful tree swifts (*Dendrochelidon comatus* and *D. longipennis*). I also got male and female of an aberrant cuckoo (*Ph\u00e6nicopha\u00ebs erythrognathus*). The plumage in both sexes of this species is alike, but the irides of the male are pale blue, those of the female bright yellow. I obtained also a number of other species of birds.\n\nWe returned to the steamer about 10 A.M., and started almost immediately back for Kwala Pahang, where we arrived at 5 P.M., and there Mr. Rodger left to return. We then steamed south *en route* for Singapore, where we arrived at 9.20 A.M. on Tuesday.\n\nThe coast-line between the Cheranting and Rompin Rivers is very fine, the hills coming in many cases to the water's edge, and tier above tier rising away into the interior. In some cases the hills that we could see in the far distance must have been from eight to ten thousand feet high. On Pulau Tioman and in the Rumpin River mangrove was met with, but the other places visited seemed to be free from it. The beach, or rather only that portion of it covered during the N.E. monsoon, was covered with pumice-stone. In many places, as at Cheranting and Rumpin, the pieces were often about six inches across.\n\nAt Tringganu, on the beach, His Excellency the Governor collected a number of the shells of an oyster. These are so delicate and translucent that at first I mistook them for the scales of a large fish. They are small, barely two inches across, but as pearly on the outer as on the inner surface. His Excellency has kindly given me for the Museum the best pair he collected.\n\nIt was rather remarkable that during the entire trip no land snake was met with; a few sea snakes were seen.\n\nWm. Davison,\nSecretary, Raffles Library and Museum.\n\nSingapore, 30th August, 1889.\nA LIST OF THE BIRDS OF THE BORNEAN GROUP OF ISLANDS\n\nBY\n\nA. H. EVERETT, C.M.Z.S.\n\nNOTE.\n\nHE only complete lists of the Birds of Borneo and its adjacent islands hitherto published appear to be the well known \"Catalogo Sistematico degli Uccelli di Borneo\" of Count Salvadori and a \"Liste des Oiseaux de Borneo\" by M. VordeMan. The first named work appeared as the fourteenth volume of the Annals of the Civic Museum of Genoa in 1874, and although still indispensable to students of Indo-Malayan ornithology, it has now fallen out of date in many important respects, while the list of M. VordeMan is simply a catalogue of titles without references, brought out at Batavia in 1886, and it also is already out of date. Such being the case, I have endeavoured, in the following list, to compile a fresh catalogue of all the species of birds authentically recorded up to the present date as inhabiting or visiting the Bornean group of islands, with the object of providing a provisional hand-list to be of temporary use to field collectors and others until material shall have been so far further accumulated as to enable some competent ornithologist to take up the Bornean avifauna and treat it in an exhaustive manner. This cannot be done until more adequate series of authentic Bor-\nnean specimens of many of the species are available for study, and until the eastern, south-western, and central districts of Borneo itself, and a proportion of the outlying islets intervening between it and the Philippines, Celebes, Java, &c., together with the mountains of Palawan, have been worked by collectors.\n\nThe area of the Bornean group may be defined for the purposes of this list by a line which, starting from a point immediately to the west of St. Julian I. in the Tambelan Archipelago and being drawn to the south of the Great Natuna, passes northward of Labuan, and follows thence the 100-fathom line so as to embrace Balabac, Palawan (Paragua), the Calamianes, and the Cuyo islands, and, returning along the same line of soundings on the southern side of Palawan, is drawn immediately to the eastward of the islands of Cagayan Sulu and Sibutu\u2014whence it is continued through the Macassar Straits south of the Paternoster, Lauriot (Laoet Ketjil) and Solombo islets, and in a north-westerly direction up through the Carimata Strait back to the island of St. Julian.\n\nIn thus attempting to define the area within which the adjacent smaller islands may be regarded as being affiliated zoologically to Borneo, there exists no guide, in many cases, beyond their greater proximity to the latter island than to the other neighbouring large masses of land by which they are surrounded, and the evidence afforded by the soundings shown on our Admiralty Charts. The limits above adopted must, therefore, be looked upon as being in some degree approximate. But as there are no islands of considerable size of which the fauna is wholly unknown, except the Great Natuna, bordering upon the line of delimitation, it is not probable that any material extension or contractions of the boundary here assumed for the Bornean group will be necessitated by the results of future field-work.\n\nThe present list and its arrangement being of a provisional and tentative character, no attempt has been made to compile a complete synonymy of the species enumerated. Such references as are given are only sufficient, as a general rule, to\nserve as authority for the title which I have adopted, and for the inclusion of the species in the Bornean avifauna. For the same reason, all field-notes are excluded, with the exception that the distribution of each species within the limits of the Bornean group is noted so far as is at present feasible.\n\nAs many of the localities indicated do not appear on the accompanying maps, I may mention that Matang, Sirambu, Jambusan, Puak, Bidi, Busau, Paku and Buntal are all within a radius of 15 miles of the town of Kuching in Sarawak; Marintaman, Mengalong, Kalias and Lumbidan are on the coast of Borneo immediately opposite Labuan; Sigalind and Gomanton are in the vicinity of Sandakan in North-east Borneo; Kupang, Kuala Kapoeas, Tumbang Hiang, Telang, Tamiang, Rangas, Meratus Mountains and Lihong Bahaja are in the South-east portion of the island. The locality Kuala Kapoeas is not to be confounded with the great river called Kapoeas, which debouches on the west coast of Borneo, and on which the town of Pontianak is situated.\n\nNo family of birds is exclusively confined to the Bornean group, and but few genera even are peculiar. *Allocotops*, *Chlocharis*, *Androphilus* and *Ptilopyga* among the Timeliidae; *Tricophoropsis* and *Orcoctistes* among the Brachypodidae; *Pityriasis* (?) among the Laniidae; *Chlamydoch\u00e6ra* among the Campophagidae; *Heteroscops* among the Babonid\u00e6; *Lobiophasis* among the Phaxianid\u00e6; and *H\u00e6matortyx* among the Tetraonid\u00e6. These all appear to be peculiar to the island of Borneo alone; while we have *Ptilocichla* among the Timeliidae and *Dryococcyx* among the Cocobid\u00e6 restricted apparently to the Palawan sub-group.

Through the kindness of Professor B\u00fcttikofer one of these skins has recently been sent to London, and on comparison with a series of O. maculatus it was found to be identical with that species and not with O. indicus. A single skin of O. maculatus purporting to have come from N. W. Borneo is preserved in the British Museum collection. It is registered as having been procured from Sir H.\nLow in 1846. I include the species with considerable doubt, for it is very singular that so conspicuous a bird has not occurred to any one of the numerous collectors since 1846.\n\n117.\u2014Oriolus xanthonotus.\n\n*Oriolus xanthonotus*, Salvad., Ucc.

The Lumbidan specimen exhibits a fairly well-defined black chin, which character does not seem to have been present in the type, of which the throat is described simply as white, and it is so depicted in the plate. Hence perhaps Mr. Sharpe was led to identify *P. bertae* with *P. orcas*, in which the absence of a black chin was deemed by Swinhoe to distinguish it from *P. nympha* of China. There is only a single skin of *P. nympha* in the British Museum and in it the chin, which is partly denuded of feathers, seems to have been white. Probably when a series of skins of the three species can be brought together, it will be found that *P. bertae* is identical with *P. nympha*, the individuals found in Borneo being occasional migrants from China.\n\n263.\u2014Pitta ussheri.\n\n*Pitta ussheri*, Sharpe, P.

A comparison of Mr. Sharpe's type with four examples of the Bornean species, two of which want the yellow shoulder spot and agree otherwise in plumage with *I. malayanus*, shows that the latter does not differ materially in dimensions from the Borneo birds. I think, therefore, that *I. malayanus* must take place as a synonym of *I. archipelagicus*, which thus ceases to be a species peculiar to Borneo.\n\nSUB-ORDER\u2014COCCYGEO.\n\nFAMILY\u2014CUCULID\u00c6.\n\nSUB-FAMILY\u2014CUCULIN\u00c6.\n\nGENUS\u2014CUCULUS.\n\n361.\u2014Cuculus canorinus.\n\n*Cuculus canorinus*, Salvad., Ucc.

Penthoceryx pravatus (Horsf.) appears to be a distinct species and to be confined to Java and perhaps the islands intervening between it and Timor.\n\n**GENUS\u2014HIEROCOCCYX.**\n\n366.\u2014Hierococcyx strenus.\n\n*Hierococcyx strenus*, Sharpe, P.

There are, however, two skins of true *C. sepulchralis* in the British Museum from Borneo, *fide* Verreaux.

Princesa (Platen).\nTrue *Chrysococcyx basalis* is, judging from the single skin in the British Museum, a very distinct species, and is confined apparently to Java. *Heterococcyx neglectus* (Schleg.), which is enumerated as a distinct species peculiar to Borneo in Count Salvadori's Catalogue, is omitted in the present list. The title was founded upon a single skin apparently, which was collected by S. M\u00fcller and is said to be preserved in the Leyden Museum. The bird was described as being adult, but there is a possibility that it represents a style of *C. xanthorhynchos*, and a comparison of the type seems desirable.\n\n**GENUS\u2014COCCYSTES.**\n\n374.\u2014Coccystes coromandus.\n\n*Coccystes coromandus*, Salvad., Ucc.

Blasius, Abhandl. Nat. Ver. Bremen, v, p. 47.\nPontianak (*Diard*).\nThere is one specimen of this bird in the Norwich Museum \"said to be from Borneo, but probably incorrectly\" (*Gurney, Ibis*, 1880, p. 467). In the British Museum Catalogue *B. jerdonii* appears as a synonym of *B. reinwardti*, but Mr. Sharpe informs me that, unless proved to be a distinct species, its place will probably be with *Baza sumatrensis*. Until the precise affinity of the Bornean bird is settled, I follow provisionally Count Salvadori's nomenclature.\n\n426.\u2014Baza leucopias.\n*Baza leucopias*, Sharpe, *Ibis*, 1888, p. 195.\nTaguso (*Whitehead*).\nRepresentative form of *B. sumatrensis* (Lafreon.).\n\n**Genus\u2014MICROHIERAX**\n\n427.\u2014Microhierax fringillarius.\n*Microhierax fringillarius*, Sharpe, Cat.

B. Pryer*); Silam (*Guillemard*).\nThis distinct species appears to entirely replace *M. fringillarius* in Northern Borneo. According to Mr. Gurney it occurs also in the Nicobar Islands (*S. F.*, viii, p. 476), but I cannot but think that his informant must have been in error as to the origin of the specimen.\nGENUS\u2014FALCO.\n\n429.\u2014Falco communis.\n\n*Falco communis*, Salvad., Ucc.

A very dark and richly-coloured Peregrine from Lawas in the British Museum is referred by Mr. Gurney (*Ibis*, 1882, p. 302) to *Falco melanogenys*. On the other hand this specimen with the dark birds recorded from Java are believed by Mr. Sharpe to be representatives of a local race of Peregrines permanently resident in the islands above-mentioned. The birds ordinarily met with in Labuan and Northern Borneo appear in the N. E. Monsoon, and are doubtless regular winter migrants, probably from China. Mr. Whitehead, although he identified a Peregrine on Kina Balu, failed to obtain a specimen from that locality.\n\n430.\u2014Falco severus.\n\n*Falco severus*, Brugg., Abhandl. Nat. Ver.

Although it is possible that stragglers may visit the Southern districts of Borneo, this species has not been noticed by any modern collector, and it is desirable that its occurrence should be confirmed before it is definitely admitted among the birds of Borneo.\n\n**Sub-Order\u2014PANDIONES.**\n\n**Genus\u2014PANDION.**\n\n432.\u2014Pandion haliaetus.\n\n*Pandion haliaetus*, Salvad., Ucc.

Alfred Marche, who procured two specimens, \"dont l'un, le m\u00e2le, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 en 1881 \u00e0 Paragay (Lu\u00e7on) tandis que l'autre, la femelle, provient, suivant M.

The occurrence of this species in Luzon is, I venture to think, extremely doubtful, and perhaps for the locality \"Paragay (Lu\u00e7on)\" should be read \"Paragua,\" which is the Spanish for the island of Palawan?\n\n492.\u2014Polyplectron schleiermacheri.\nPolyplectron schleiermacheri, Br\u00fcggem., Der Zool.
