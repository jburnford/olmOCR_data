Lat. 26\u00b0 24', long. 85\u00b0 43'.\n\nCOIMBATORE, within the territories subject to the presidency of Madras, a British district, named from its principal place. It is bounded on the north and north-west by the territory of Mysore; on the north-east by the British district of Salem; on the east by the British districts of Salem and Trichinopoly; on the south-east by the British district of Madura; on the south by Madura and the territory of Travancore; and on the west by the British district of Malabar and the native territory of Cochin. It lies between lat. 10\u00b0 14'\u201412\u00b0 19', long. 76\u00b0 36'\u201478\u00b0 16'; and according to official return, has an area of 8,280 square miles. The general physical aspect of the district is that of a great recess opening to the east, in which direction it communicates with the vast plain of the Carnatic. The general surface is level, having at its western extremity, or towards the base of the Ghats, an average elevation of 800 or 900 feet above the sea. This district is inclosed\nCOIMBATORE.\n\non the north by the mazy group of mountains bordering the table-land of Mysore; on the south by the Pulnai or Vurragiri Mountains, and by the Animali range. Beyond the deep gap of Palghatcheri, it has on its north-western side the Kundah and Neilgherry groups. The gap of Palghatcheri, which divides the Animali group from that of the Kundahs, and which completely intersects the great range of the Ghats from east to west, is about twenty miles wide, having near the centre an elevation, stated, as a rough approximation, to be 970 feet above the sea. The line of waterheads is on the western frontier of the district; and with the exception of a very small portion of the south-west angle, where some valleys of the Animali group are drained by the Palaur, flowing westward to the Indian Ocean, the whole drainage of the district is conveyed by numerous streams to the Cauvery, and ultimately discharged by its channel into the Bay of Bengal. Many of these mountains have very considerable elevations above the sea. Kudiakad, in the Kundah range, attains a height of 8,502 feet; Animali, 8,970; the Pulnai or Vurragiri range, between 6,000 and 7,000. The group in the north-east, forming the continuation of the table-land of Mysore towards the Carnatic, is of moderate elevation; few summits, probably, being more than 3,000 feet. The geological formation of this last group is primitive, consisting of granite, gneiss, and rocks allied to them. The geological character, also, of the rocks in the Kundah group is primitive. Of the same formation, moreover, are the Animali and Vurragiri groups. The principal rivers of the district are the Cauvery, Bhovani, Noyel, and Ambrawutty. The Cauvery, rising in the territory of Coorg, and taking a course generally south-east through the territory of Mysore, touches on this district at Tullacaud, where, turning eastward, it for forty miles forms the boundary between it and the territory of Mysore; it then becomes the boundary between this district and the British district of Salem, and, flowing south-eastward, continues to divide them for 140 miles, as far as Trimaconulloor, where it receives the Ambrawutty, and passes into the British district of Trichinopoly. The Bhovani takes its rise in the Kundah range, and after flowing first south-east for about fifteen miles, and then north-eastward for the same distance, enters this district.\nnear the village of Somunthoray, and flows through it first in a north-eastern, then in an eastern direction, for ninety miles, to its fall into the Cauvery on the eastern frontier. The Noyel also rises in the Kundah range, but south of the source of the Bhovani, and, flowing easterly by the town of Coimbatoor, falls into the Cauvery on the right side, in lat. $11^\\circ 4'$, long. $78^\\circ$; its total length of course, which is about ninety-five miles, being wholly through this district. The Ambrawutty rises in the maze of mountains where the Pulnai and Animali groups unite, and, after flowing north-eastward for fifteen miles, enters this district, through which it continues its course in the same direction for 115 miles, and falls into the Cauvery on the right side, near the village of Trimaconulloor. Those principal streams receive right and left a great number of torrents, flowing briskly during the periodical rains, but at other times they are almost devoid of water. Much of the irrigation requisite for the production of crops is effected by means of wells, of which, according to official return, the number is 38,429; the average depth of water being twenty-five feet.\n\nThe water obtained from them is generally very brackish, but it is considered peculiarly favourable to the culture of tobacco, that raised on lands thus irrigated being the best produced in the district. Near the mountains in the southern and western parts of this district are several extensive morasses, and the villages in the vicinity of such places are noted for insalubrity. The climate in general, however, may be concluded, on scientific principles, to have greatly the advantage over the maritime parts of the Carnatic, partly in consequence of greater elevation, and partly from the volume of cool and fresh air introduced from the Indian Ocean through the great Palghat gap. The rains are principally brought by the north-east monsoon, which prevails from the beginning of November to the end of December; and then the Cauvery, Noyel, Bhovani, Ambrawutty, and their numerous feeders, as well as the tanks, are replenished, and the low grounds become deluged with water. For a month or six weeks after the end of the monsoon, the season is comparatively cool, delightful, and healthful, the north-east wind proving cheering and bracing to weakly constitutions. The midday temperature, however, is high; the range of the thermometer in the shade being from $62^\\circ$ to $80^\\circ$ or $82^\\circ$. Towards\nCOIMBATORE.\n\nthe end of January and throughout February, dews fall heavily, and fogs occasion intermittent fevers and catarrhs. After the end of March the north-east winds cease, and are succeeded by occasional calms and variable breezes; southerly and south-east winds succeed, and continue to about the middle of May. During April the weather gradually becomes hotter, and the average range of the thermometer for the month is from 76\u00b0 to 93\u00b0. In May it rises as high as 96\u00b0 or 98\u00b0 in the shade, and seldom falls below 79\u00b0. From the interposition of the Ghats, the south-west monsoon is but little felt, except in the rise of the Cauvery, replenished on the table-lands of Coorg and Mysore.\n\nMuch of the district has a rich red soil, mixed with sand or gravel, formed by the disintegration of quartz; and in some tracts the sand and gravel constitute the whole soil, which in consequence is very sterile. The most valuable soil is a black carbonaceous clay, generally called cotton-ground or regur. \"The black colour of this clay, the carbonate of lime, agates and zeolites found in it, and its conversion into a black glass by heat, all indicate that it has originated from the disintegration of trap rocks.\" This black alluvial clay is remarkable for long retaining moisture, from which quality the fertility for which it is noted is considered to result.\n\nThe only mineral of importance is iron-ore, either a brown haematite or a black oxide, found in the form of sand. Beryl is found in considerable abundance, and some specimens are of very fine quality. Saltpetre abounds, but is considered to be of inferior quality. It is procured by washing the earth; and a coarse culinary salt for domestic purposes is obtained by the same process.\n\nThe zoology of this district has not been described, though, from the physical circumstances of the tract, it may be inferred to be rich. Elephants are very numerous about the bottom, and in the secluded valleys of the Ghauts, as well as in the Animali or Animalaya group, which has received its name, meaning Elephant Hill, from the great number of those animals which harbour in it. In the course of four years, immediately preceding 1843, between 700 and 800 elephants were destroyed by the public establishment maintained for this purpose. The price of the largest and finest pair of tusks is\nCOIMBATORE.\n\nfrom 8l. to 9l., and of those of smaller size from 4l. to 6l. Many more were destroyed in the same interval by private persons, who never reported the facts; as, although government rewarded the destruction of an elephant, the tusks, which were required to be surrendered, were often of considerably greater value than the reward. Of domestic cattle, kine are excellent and numerous. They are white, of a light make, bony, with large dewlaps, very active, and are in great demand for fleet draught all over the Carnatic. The breed of buffaloes is inferior, but that of sheep is good, they being easily fattened, and their flesh of excellent quality: their wool, though coarse, is manufactured into excellent carpets and blankets. Silk is produced in the district, but the quantity is small, and the quality not prime.\n\nThe vegetable productions consist chiefly of dry grains. The principal alimentary crops are gram (Cicer arietinum), various sorts of panic, as Panicum miliaceum, Panicum italicum, Panicum spicatum; various kinds of millet, Holcus spicatus, Holcus saccharatus, Curcuma longa or turmeric. Of commercial crops, opium is raised on the hills, but not of superior quality. The castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis) is much cultivated, and its produce consumed at home, and exported largely. Experiments have been conducted by the government for the introduction and cultivation of the Mauritius sugar-cane, and favourable reports have been received of their progress. Cotton is produced, and manufactured into coarse fabrics for home wear, and for exportation to Trichinopoly, Salem, Mysore, and Malabar. One of the experimental farms established by the government, with the view of introducing the American species of cotton, was located in this district. In 1849 it was discontinued; the object for which it was formed, having, it is said, been fully attained by \"demonstrating that the soil and climate are capable of producing cotton suitable to the British market.\" The district is noted for the abundance and excellence of the tobacco which it produces. Its superiority is \"attributable\" to the richness and suitableness of the soil for its culture, to its being irrigated from wells containing much saltpetre, and to the attention paid to its cultivation.\" The sandal-tree grows freely in the jungly forests round the base of the hills, and the wood is\nexported in considerable quantities. The extensive forests in the neighbourhood of the Anaimalai Hills contain abundance of teak and other valuable timber.\n\nThe population is officially returned at 1,153,862. It consists almost entirely of Brahmins. The language spoken is the Tamil.\n\nThe routes, generally speaking, between Coimbatore and the adjoining districts are good, having lately been much improved. The trunk road is from north-east to south-west, from Salem, through the towns of Coimbatore and Palghat, to the western coast at Ponany. The principal places are Coimbatore, Palaghat, and Darampoor.\n\nCOIMBATTOOR,\u00b9 * the principal place of the British district of the same name, is situate near the left bank of the river Noyel, a tributary of the Cauvery, in a dry and well-cultivated country, on the declivity, and near the base of the great mountain-group of Neilgherry, and on the north side of the remarkable depression\u00b2 which traverses the Ghauts from east to west. From this latter circumstance it is admirably ventilated by the currents of air incessantly sweeping that great gorge. The streets are wide,\u00b3 airy, and neatly built; but the salubrity of the place is impaired by the bad quality of the water, which is obtained from wells, and is for the most part brackish. The European quarter is eastward of the town, and detached from it. The jail for the district is situate in the south-eastern part of the town, and is a large square building, capable of containing 275 prisoners. A detachment of native infantry is stationed here. The huts of the sepoys are near the town. On its south side is a tank, never less than three miles in length, and during the rains increasing to a lake of considerable extent. In the time of Hyder Ali the town is said to have contained 4,000 houses; but it suffered much in the wars between the British government and Mysore. Elevation above the sea 1,483 feet. Distance from Calicut, E., 80 miles; Mangalore, S.E., 196; Bombay, S.E., 600; Seringapatam, S., 100; Bangalore, S., 140; Madras, S.W., 268. Lat. 11\u00b0, long. 77\u00b0 1'.\n\nCOLABA.\u00b9\u2014This name is given to the southern\u00b2 part of Lighthouse Island, the northern being called by the British\n\n* Coimbatore of Buchanan; Coimbitoor of Wilks.\nCOLABA.\n\nOldwoman's Island. These two parts are connected by a causeway, overflowed at spring tides. Lighthouse Island is likewise connected with Bombay Island by a causeway. In 1838, a spot of ground at the northern extremity of the island, which was usually covered by the sea at high water, was granted to a company of European and native merchants, for the purpose of constructing a wharf and line of warehouses for the deposit of merchandise, and of excavating a canal, to insure constant smooth water for boats lying alongside the wharf.\n\nColaba is the seat of an observatory, one of sixty now in operation in various parts of the world, for the purpose of magnetic and meteorological observation, whereat the instruments are read hourly, day and night, without interruption. The building was completed, the instruments set up, and assistants provided, in the year 1841; but a variety of untoward circumstances occurred, which for a considerable period retarded the course of observation, and rendered the results attained imperfect and untrustworthy. The obstacles which prevented the perfect success of the establishment were, however, by degrees overcome, and in the latter part of the year 1842, the duties of the establishment were brought into orderly and systematic discharge. In 1843 further improvement was effected; and from that time the proceedings of the institution have been highly satisfactory. The charge of the observatory was allotted, in the first instance, to Mr. Orlebar, professor of natural philosophy in the Elphinstone College, Bombay.\n\nThe erection of a church at Colaba was commenced in 1848. The construction of this edifice was the result of a desire to establish some permanent memorial of the gallantry and endurance of those who fell in Scinde and Affghanistan; and the mode chosen, was selected on the ground of combining a record of the departed brave, with a purpose of the highest spiritual utility. The cost of the building was estimated at 70,000 rupees, or about 7,000l. Towards this sum the government contributed 30,000 rupees, the remainder to be supplied by private subscription. But the estimate having been considerably exceeded, the government has been authorized to contribute a further sum, equal to a moiety of the balance required.\nColaba is the seat of barracks, which formerly were subject to the inconveniences arising from an unsatisfactory supply of water. To provide a remedy for this evil, was an object combined with the construction of the causeway connecting Colaba with Bombay Island; and a sufficient extent of iron pipes were forwarded from England to enable the project to be completed. The centre of the island is about lat. $18^\\circ 53'$, long. $72^\\circ 52'$.\n\n**COLABA (Angria's lapsed territory).\u2014See KOLABA.**\n\n**COLA BERA.\u2014A town in the British district of Sumbulpore, on the south-west frontier of Bengal, 35 miles N.E. of Sumbulpore.

It has a course of about seventeen miles, generally in a south-easterly direction, to its confluence with the Jumna, on the right side, in lat. 30\u00b0 47', long. 78\u00b0 10'. It is one of the largest streams which the Jumna receives above the confluence of the Tons. Hodgson crossed it in the beginning of April, a little above its mouth, when it was seventy feet wide, two and a half deep, and very rapid.\n\nCOMAREALLWA.\u2014A town in the British district of Cuddapah, presidency of Madras, 29 miles S.W. of Cuddapah. Lat. 14\u00b0 16', long. 78\u00b0 30'.\n\nCOMBAKONUM, in the British district of Tanjore, a town the principal place of a large and valuable tallook or subdivision which bears the same name. It is situate in a low level tract between two considerable branches or outlets of the river Cauvery, and extends about two miles in length from north to south, and one mile in breadth from east to west. The houses are built in the usual native style, and some in the chief streets have two stories. The bazaar forms a long and tolerably wide street, and is well supplied with provisions. There are several celebrated pagodas here, and consequently a considerable number of Brahmins, who live on the revenues of those establishments. Many devotees resort hither to visit the pagodas. There is also considerable traffic; but the exercise\nof manufacturing art is chiefly confined to weaving. The weavers are said to be very industrious, but, like those engaged in the same employment in most other places, very poor. Notwithstanding its slight elevation above the sea, this place is remarkably healthy both for Europeans and natives. The lines for the small detachment of native infantry stationed here, are situate on a sandy piece of ground near the river, where are also the court-house, the jail, and the hospital. The jail is constructed to contain three hundred prisoners. Distance from Tanjore, N.E., 20 miles; Madura, N.E., 112; Bangalore, S.E., 186; Madras, S.W., 160.

Its centre is about lat. 19\u00b0 35', long. 93\u00b0 35'.\n\nCOMERCOLLY, in the British district of Pubna, presidency of Bengal, a town situate on the route from Berhampore to Dacca, 77 miles S.E. of former, 95 W. of latter. It is situate on the Gorae, a large offset flowing south-eastward from the Ganges, and often denominated by the British the river of Comercolly. The river is described by Heber as having the width of the Thames at Vauxhall. Distance from Calcutta, N.E., 104 miles. Lat. 23\u00b0 52', long. 89\u00b0 14'.\n\nCOMORIN (CAPE), in the native state of Travancore, the most southern point of what is called the Peninsula of India. \"It is formed of a circular low sandy point, not discernible above the distance of three and a half or four leagues from the deck of a large ship. Within two or three cables' length of the south-east part of the point lies a sloping rocky islet, high above water, with other rocks about it, on which the sea breaks. To the westward of this islet, the shore of the cape is sandy and barren, but to the eastward it abounds with trees, having a fort and village among them close to the sea.\" The land is bold, and safe to approach within about a mile and a half or two miles, the depth of water in some places increasing towards the shore. \"A great way out from the cape there is a bank abounding in cod, where some ships have caught considerable numbers of those fish; but it appears to be of small extent and little known.\" The base of the southern extremity of the Western Ghauts is about a mile or a mile and a half\nCONCAN.\n\nfrom the sea. \"These mountains rise in majestic sharp peaks, chained together, and forming a ridge;\" and \"a little detached from the end of the chain over the cape, on the east side, there is a sharp conical mountain by itself, like a sugarloaf.\"* A bold summit, some distance north of the cape, when viewed from afar, appears isolated, and has by navigators sailing at a distance been often mistaken for the cape itself. To the eastward of the rocky islet previously mentioned, and about three miles from it, is a fort. Colonel Welsh, describing the place in 1824, says, \"A few fishermen's houses, some venerated temples, and a Dutch church, now form the celebrated town of Cape Comorin.\" Lat. 8\u00b0 5', long. 77\u00b0 37'.\n\nCONCAN,\u00b9 in the presidency of Bombay, a narrow tract stretching from the south of Sawuntwarree, on the frontier of Goa, in lat. 15\u00b0 44', long. 73\u00b0 45', to the Damaun river, in lat. 20\u00b0 22', long. 72\u00b0 52', a length of about three hundred and thirty miles, with a breadth varying from twenty-five to fifty miles. It is bounded on the west by the Arabian Sea, and on the east by the culminating ridge of the Ghats. The eastern part, stretching up the face of the Ghats, and along their summits, is extremely rugged. The mean elevation of the western, or more depressed part, is about 100 feet;\u00b2 but it has many isolated hills, or short ranges, some of which have a considerable elevation. Though rugged, this tract has many fertile valleys, each of which, for the most part, affords a passage to a small river or torrent holding a westerly course from the Ghats to the Arabian Sea. The geological surface-formation is volcanic, generally trap, rising in terraces from the low country to the summit of the Ghats, and in some places overlaid by ferruginous sandstone, which, when decomposed,\u00b3 forms a laterite, easily mouldering into a reddish fertile earth. But a country so rugged cannot but contain much land that is totally irclaimable, though producing in its gorges and ravines dense jungle, infested by beasts of prey,\u2074 especially tigers, here remarkably fierce and destructive. In some places, however, the rock is so hard and close as totally to preclude vegetation of any kind, and presents the appearance of a huge black mass overtopping the general outline of the mountain. This is in\n\n* Of this mountain a good view is given by Daniell.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Twenty-four Landscape Views in Hindostan, by W. and T. Daniell; Lond. 1807, No. 1.\n\n\u00b2 Transactions of Geol.

The rivers, in the upper or steeper part of their course, near the mountains, are clear and rapid; but after entering the level country, where they are affected by the tide, they are very deep and muddy, their estuaries forming small havens, which, before the establishment of British supremacy, afforded lurking-places for pirates. The most fertile spots are on the banks of streams. The rivers abound with fish, but they are also frequented by alligators. Venomous serpents are unfortunately very numerous. The climate is characterized by the great heaviness of the monsoon rains, the amount of which in one year has been known to be nearly 300 inches. The Concan abounds in thermal springs, the water of which has a temperature in no instance exceeding $110^\\circ$, and is found very serviceable in cases of rheumatism. When cooled, it is pleasant and salubrious to drink.\n\nThe Concan comprehends two collectorates,\u2014Tannah and Rutnaghery, which will be found more particularly described in their proper places in the alphabetical arrangement. Of the tract south of Bombay, Mhar is the principal town. There are numerous small towns or forts along the coast, at the estuaries of the small rivers, or on the creeks or small bays, which abound. Of those places the most worthy of notice are Junjera, Rutnagheriah, Viziadroog, and Vingorla, notices of which are given under their respective names.\n\nThe Concan appears to have been little noticed in Indian history until the beginning of the sixteenth century, when its seacoasts became the scene of the daring and active operations of the Portuguese. In the middle of the seventeenth century it was conquered from the king of Beejapore by the Mahratta leader Sevajee. Aurungzebe was less successful in his attempts upon it: his son Moazzim, whom he despatched against it, lost, in 1684, nearly the whole of his horses and cattle, either from want of provisions, or from the deadly effect of the climate. It thenceforward remained under the rule of the chief of Sattara, and subsequently under that of the Peishwa, until, on the overthrow of the latter in 1818, it was incorporated with the dominions of the East-India Company.\n\nCONDAPILLY, in the British district of Masulipatam, presidency of Madras, a hill-fort, having an elevation of about\nCON.\n\n1,700 feet above the level of the sea.

It is situate on the Wegawati, a torrent devoid of water during the dry season. The streets are wide,\\(^2\\) cross each other at right angles, and have a row of cocoanut-trees on each side. The houses are of mud; they are roofed with tiles, and are built in the form of a square, with an inclosed court in the middle: altogether they appear superior to the houses in the country towns of Bengal. The principal inhabitants are Brahmins, of whom there are about a hundred families, and a large number of dancing-girls, kept in honour of Iswara or Siva. The pagodas dedicated to that deity and his consort Kamachuma are represented as \"great\\(^3\\) stone buildings, very clumsily executed both in their joinings and carvings, and totally devoid of elegance or grandeur, although they are wonderfully crowded with what are meant as ornaments.\" These pagodas are highly famed in the mythological lore of the Brahmins, and are amongst the most revered and frequented in Southern India. The great gateway of the pagoda, as is usually the case with such structures, is huge and lofty, and from the top, which is reached by seven flights of stairs, there is a view \"extremely fine,\\(^4\\) consisting of extensive woods intersected by a large sheet of water, with numerous pagodas rising among the trees, and a magnificent range of retiring mountains in the distance.\" Distance from Cuddalore, N., 81 miles; Arcot, E., 27; Bangalore, E., 145; Madras, S.W., 42.

In the rainy season, those rivers bring down a body of water, which makes the lake or inlet quite fresh; but during the rest of the year it is as salt as the external sea. The situation of the fort is very fine. The town, once considerable, but now rather decayed, was formerly joined by a bridge to the town of Kanyapoora, situate on the south or opposite side of the narrow inlet by which the lake communicates with the sea.

Its lanes are straight, and fenced with stone walls, and it has many cocoanut-gardens. Twice it had the misfortune of having Tippoo's army encamped in its vicinity, and on both occasions it was burned down by some of the irregulars.\" Salt is made on the banks of the cove, by evaporating the sea-water. Of late years, this place appears to have recovered its former prosperity, from being selected as the port of shipment for the raw cotton produced in the district of Bellary and in the Southern Mahratta country. A road from Dharwar, by Sirry, was opened some time since; but this affording but imperfect accommodation, another was subsequently constructed, opening a communication for wheeled carriages for the entire distance between Dharwar and Coomta.\u00b3 The town is situate about a mile from the port, which, however, is little more than an open roadstead, having a headland running out at its northern termination, which protects the anchorage from the north-west wind, being that which prevails nearly the whole of the trading season, and renders the bay comparatively calm during this part of the year; but it is entirely exposed to the south-west monsoon, and after this commences, it is unsafe for any country vessel to remain there.\u2074 Distant N.W. from Mangalore 113 miles, S.E. from Bombay 328, N.W. from Madras 410.

General Matthews, preparing for the disastrous expedition in which he perished, made lines around this fort. The town contains about 250 houses, and has long been stationary with respect to increase of size and prosperity. The tallook of which this town is the principal place extends between the sea and the Ghauts, numerous streams flowing down from which traverse it. Hence the soil is moist, and water is found at no great depth below the surface; and as there is a considerable quantity of fertile ground, rice succeeds well. In the numerous creeks and inlets, a considerable quantity of salt is made, by evaporating sea-water. The area of the tallook is 432 square miles, and the population, according to official report, 72,767; indicating a relative density of 168 to the square mile. The tract comprised within this subdivision, according to Wilks, formed part of the dominions of the Cadumba dynasty, which at a remote period ruled extensively over this part of India, and was subverted during the second century of the Christian era. Coondapoor town, and some other posts on the seashore, were in the early part of the sixteenth century seized by the Portuguese, and the more inland tract was included within the great realm of Vijayanagar until its overthrow, in 1565, by a Mussulman confederacy at Telikota; subsequently to which this territory appears to have become part of the state of Bednor; on the overthrow of which by Hyder Ali, in 1763, it became incorporated with his dominions; and when his son, in 1799, fell beneath the attack of the British, it became part of the British district of North Canara.

The south-west monsoon sets in at this station in the month of June, but with less rigour than at Ootacamund, owing to the clouds, which come charged with rain from the westward, meeting with opposition from the high spurs of the Dodabetta range which intervene. The annual fall of rain here averages fifty-five inches; that at Ootacamund sixty inches. Distant N. from Coimbatoor 26 miles.

While a separate raj, its limits were more extensive; but upon the subjugation of the province by the British, in 1834, the talooks of Pootoor and Umr Sooleay were annexed to the collectorate of Canara. The present district of Coorg lies between lat. 11\u00b0 56' and 12\u00b0 45', long. 75\u00b0 25' and 76\u00b0 13'; and extends about sixty miles from north to south, and thirty-five from east to west. The area is estimated at about 1,420 square miles. Coorg is a very rugged, and altogether mountainous region, the lowest part being fully 3,000 feet above the sea. The tract which most nearly resembles a plain, is the valley, about eighteen miles long and thirteen broad, lying between Merkara and Naknaad, which, viewed from above, has a level appearance, but when examined more closely, is found to consist of a succession of low ridges, with small narrow valleys, or perhaps rather ravines, between them; the lowest being the bed of the great river Cauvery. The ridges are parallel to each other, and commence in a steep abutment, whence they proceed in a direction south-east, until they terminate in the plains of Mysore or Wynaad. Some of those ranges have on their summits very small table-lands, but\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.\n\n\u00b2 Report on Med. Topography and Statistics of Coorg, 1.\n\n\u00b3 Madras Journal of Literature and Science, iv. 339\u2014Baikie, on the Climate of Coorg.\nin general their tops are sharp ridges. The whole country, with few exceptions, is covered with forests more or less dense, but seldom so overgrown by underwood as to qualify them to be called jungle. To the eastward, however, towards Mysore, in which direction the elevation of the surface diminishes, bamboos make their appearance, and the forest becomes thick jungle, filled with every variety of wild animals. The prevailing geological formations are primitive; \"the principal rocks being sienite, granite, and greenstone; and the subordinate ranges being uniformly capped with a thick stratum of lithomargic earth, consisting of detritus of granite or sienite in every stage of decomposition, cemented by argillaceous earth, and coloured by oxide of iron. Large masses of felspar of a cream-colour, partially decomposed, and in the state of what is called porcelain clay, are also of frequent occurrence.\" The following are the principal elevations which have been registered in Coorg; but it is possible that there may be some greater not yet ascertained:\n\n| Location                  | Feet   |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Tadiandemole              | 5,781  |\n| Poopagherry               | 5,682  |\n| Bittatoor                 | 4,824  |\n| Road from Merkara to Frazerpett | 4,781  |\n| Soorlaby                  | 4,527  |\n| Merkara                   | 4,506  |\n| Bhoekerai Hill            | 4,500  |\n| Coloor Betta              | 4,500  |\n| Nakanad                   | 3,797  |\n| Veerajunderpett           | 3,899  |\n| Frazerpett                | 3,200  |\n\nThe country is intersected and traversed in every direction by ramparts, called by the natives kuddinegs. They are generally from fifteen to twenty-five feet high, with a ditch in front, of ten feet deep by eight or ten wide; and being in many places double, triple, or quadruple, their linear extent cannot be less than between 500 and 600 miles. The natives know nothing of the origin of those vast works, which in the aggregate are twenty times the extent of the Picts wall of North Britain. Their antiquity, however, is doubtless very great, as enormous trees, which must be the growth of ages, are found on many parts of the walls. The general declivity of the\nCOORG.\n\ncountry is to the north-east and east, as indicated by the course of the Cauvery and its feeders, which flow in that direction, and receive the drainage of nearly four-fifths of the country. The Cauvery rises near the top of a hill on the eastern verge of the Western Ghauts, in lat. 12\u00b0 25', long. 75\u00b0 34', and, flowing through the great valley between Merkara and Nakanad, nearly east, for about thirty-five miles, to the vicinity of Seedapoor, there turns north-east for the further distance of seven miles, to Hosaputna, where it becomes the boundary between this district and the territory of Mysore, and so continues for twenty miles to Cannagaul, where it enters Mysore. It receives right and left many torrents and streams, the principal of which is the Soornavaty or Haringhee, which drains the northern half of the country, and joins the Cauvery on the left side, in lat. 12\u00b0 30', long. 76\u00b0 2'. The Lechman Teert, another large tributary of the Cauvery, rises in lat. 11\u00b0 57', long. 76\u00b0 1', and taking a course north-east of about twenty-five miles, passes into Mysore, where it falls into the Cauvery on the right side, about fifteen miles above Serin-gapatam. In its course through Coorg the current of the Cauvery is generally tranquil, except in a few places where it traverses beds of granite rock, and it is nearly everywhere fordable in the dry season; but at Frazerpett, where it is 225 feet wide, it during the monsoon rises from twenty to thirty feet. The Puiswunni and the Burrepollai are the only considerable rivers flowing westward. The latter rises in the most elevated and secluded part of the Western Ghauts, about lat. 11\u00b0 55', long. 76\u00b0, and, flowing tortuously through the valleys and gorges of the elevated country, leaves it abruptly through a series of rocky ravines, in one of which it forms a fine cataract of nearly 300 feet in height, and, entering Malabar, falls into an estuary on the coast of the Indian Ocean, a few miles north of Cannanore. The temperature of the atmosphere in Coorg is low, owing to the elevation of the country, the proximity of the ocean to the south-west and west, and the prevalence of winds from those points. It is also remarkably equable, \"the daily range indoors never exceeding 6\u00b0 or 8\u00b0,\u2014often not beyond 2\u00b0; and the thermometer seldom rising higher than 74\u00b0, nor sinking below 60\u00b0, in the open air. The range is a little higher during the dry season;\n\nReport, ut supra, 6.\n\nMadras Journal, ut supra, lv. 840, Oct. 1880.\nCOORG.\n\nthe daily extremes being 52\u00b0 or 53\u00b0, and 68\u00b0 and 70\u00b0: the annual extremes are probably 52\u00b0 and 82\u00b0. The greatest ranges of temperature are in January and February, amounting to from 53\u00b0 to 72\u00b0; and the weather then is not only cold, but excessively dry. In April and May the heat becomes oppressive during the day, but the nights are almost always cool. The monsoon commences in June, and towards the close of that month the rain falls very heavily, insomuch that from the 22nd to the 27th of that month, in the year 1835, there fell twenty-seven inches. This weather continues during July, August, and September, the air being loaded with moisture, and the sun seldom seen; at the same time the temperature is wonderfully equable, the extremes in the open air being 56\u00b0 and 65\u00b0. The total fall of rain in one year (1835-1836) was 119\u00bd inches, of which forty-four were in June. The climate is in general healthful for Europeans, but has an unfavourable influence on those inclined to visceral congestion, asthma, or dysentery. Notwithstanding the excessive moisture, the equability of temperature causes rheumatism, catarrh, or pneumonic affections, to be little known. It is a remarkable fact, however, that the \"climate\" appears decidedly inimical to the cure of cuts, wounds, and sores, which are often totally unmanageable without change of air.\"\n\nFor so circumscribed a tract the zoology is varied and important. Elephants are numerous, and were more so until rewards were given for their destruction; since which, numbers have been shot or taken in pitfalls. Tigers are numerous, but are not so ferocious as in less-elevated and more sultry regions. Here also are found the leopard, the chita or hunting-leopard, and the tiger-cat. Bears are rare, but exceedingly fierce and dangerous. The wild dog, as large as a greyhound, but much more strongly built, hunts in packs of a dozen or more, is very fierce, and attacks and destroys even kine. The bison attains the enormous height of seventeen hands, and the elk harbours in the secluded wilds. Of deer there are the muntjak, the memina or moose-deer, and the chital or spotted deer. Wild swine, hares, and monkeys, are among the animals of this district. Of birds there are eagles, hawks, parrots, woodcocks, snipes, pigeons in great variety, and many others, including the buceros or rhinoceros-bird. The cobra di capello and\nCOORG.\n\nSome other deadly snakes are common, and alligators are sometimes seen in the Cauvery. The thickets are infested by the jungle-leech, about an inch long, not thicker than a hair, making way in great numbers through the clothes of such as enter the jungles, and causing great irritation by their bites. Bees abound, and much wild honey and wax are found in the woods.\n\nPreviously to the occupation of the country by the British, in 1834, the roads, or rather paths, were very rude, the rajahs discouraging any improvement, as tending to facilitate invasion. The only route which could be considered as a road, was that commencing at Periapatam, in Mysore, proceeding through a thick jungle to Verajenderpetta, and thence by the Huggala or Hingin Ghaut, a very steep descending pass, to Cannanore, in Malabar. This is the worst ghaut in the south of India, being so steep as to be nearly impracticable for laden cattle, and totally so for wheeled carriages; neither is it capable of much improvement, the declivity being in many places one in three feet. A road, commencing also at Periapatam, proceeds westward, but to the north of that just described, through Nunjerajpet to Merkara; but this is a very bad route, and is now nearly disused. At the present time the principal road is that leading from Mysore into Coorg, and thence into Canara. It proceeds from Periapatam north-westward, through Frazerpet to Merkara, and thence by the Sulia or Sumpaji Ghaut, having an easy slope down to Canara, and terminating at Mangalore, being practicable for guns and all sorts of carriages. Another road has been more recently constructed between Canara and Mysore, which passes by the Munjeerabad Ghaut, somewhat to the north of the road by the Sumpaji Ghaut. The authorities were induced to sanction the construction of this road by regard to its advantages, as connecting Canara and the important seaport of Mangalore with the towns and districts in the west of Mysore. There are several cross-routes, but these are merely very rude paths, full of large stones, intersected with deep ruts, and passing over steep acclivities, which might, by the exercise of an ordinary portion of skill and care, be either avoided or reduced.\n\nThe men of Coorg are a handsome athletic race, usually above the middle size, and, with scarcely any exception, well-\nlimbed. The women are not so tall in proportion, but are well made and well-looking, though rather coarse, but fair in comparison to the men. Both sexes are laborious and industrious in the practice of agriculture, their main and almost exclusive employment; except that the men shoot and hunt, partly to destroy animals injurious to their crops, and partly for the produce of the sport. They are well clad, the men wearing a turban, and a gown reaching to the feet, and being girt round the waist with a shawl or handkerchief, to which they attach the formidable Nair knife. The women wear a loose cotton wrapper, reaching from the shoulders to the knees, and a small white cloth tied round the head. Both sexes daily, after their labour, wash the whole body in warm water. A very singular and revolting custom prevails here, different from polyandry, in which each woman has exclusively a plurality of husbands. In Coorg the wives of several brothers are the wives of all. \"On the marriage\\(^1\\) of an elder brother, his wife is considered the property of all the brothers jointly; and as the juniors successively marry, their wives in turn are common to all the brothers.\" This abominable custom, however, is falling somewhat into disrepute, and its practice becoming more circumscribed. The amount of the population\\(^2\\) in 1836 was officially returned at 65,437 persons; and the increase in that year was nearly ten per cent. on the total. Since the annexation of Coorg to the British dominions, the revenue has improved, cultivation has been extended, and the general prosperity of the country steadily increased. The only assemblages of dwellings which can with any propriety be denominated towns, are Merkara, Somwarpet, and Verajenderpett.\n\nThe inhabitants of Coorg are Nairs, and consequently Brahminists of the Sudra caste;\\(^3\\) yet, in some respects, they manifest little reverence for the Brahminical code.\\(^4\\) Though a barbarous, they are an energetic and brave race, and with unflinching spirit and desperate valour they maintained\\(^5\\) their independence against the vastly superior power of Hyder Ali and his son Tippoo Sultan, severely retaliating on their oppressors in the campaign of 1791, and materially aiding in their humiliation. By the treaty of that year they were received under the protection of the British government.\n\nIn 1832, the sister of the reigning rajah, with her husband,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Report, ut supra, 91.\n\n\\(^2\\) Id. 19.\n\n\\(^3\\) Buchanan, Journey from Madras, through Mysore, Canara, and Malabar, ii. 408.\n\n\\(^4\\) Wilks, Historical Sketches, ii. 631.\n\n\\(^5\\) Id. iii. 12.\nfled from Coorg into Mysore, and claimed the protection of the British resident from the violence of their relative. Under these circumstances, it became the duty of the British authorities to afford the protection implored, without regarding the complaints of the rajah, or the military preparations which he proceeded to make. Various communications passed between those authorities and the prince, whose country, it may moreover be observed, was a prey to the most oppressive tyranny and misgovernment. At length the rajah seized and detained an emissary of the British government, who, with another native, had been despatched to Coorg, under an impression that native negotiation might be more effective than European. This act of violence the rajah defended, on the ground of reprisal for the withholding from his vengeance the fugitive victim of his tyranny. Negotiation was now relinquished; a force of 6,000 men was despatched to punish the outrage, and the government of Madras issued a proclamation to the effect, that the rajah, in consequence of oppression and cruelty to his subjects, the assumption of an attitude of hostility and menace towards the British government, the encouragement and aid afforded to its enemies, and the imprisonment of the British emissary sent to open a friendly negotiation with him, was no longer to occupy the royal seat. In the beginning of April, the British force, commanded by Colonel Lindesay, entered Coorg from Mysore, and having found the stockades made by order of the rajah deserted, advanced to Merkara, the capital, which, having been evacuated, was occupied without opposition, and the British flag hoisted. Simultaneously with the movement under Colonel Lindesay, a column under the command of Colonel Foulis marched from Cannanore, in Malabar, and ascending the course of the Burrepollai, or Stony River, penetrated into the heart of the country by the Horgullum Pass, and took the town of Verajunderpet, sixteen miles south of that of Merkara. The enemy made an abortive attempt at resistance, in which they lost about 250 men and four chiefs, the loss on the British side being comparatively insignificant. On the 13th, the wretched rajah surrendered unconditionally. During those operations, a weak column, under Colonel Jackson, marched from Mangalore, and attempted to penetrate the country by a route to the north of that of Colonel Foulis; but, entering a deep rocky\nravine, suffered from a fire so deadly and well sustained, that it was obliged to retire, after severe loss, leaving behind the wounded and the whole of its baggage. Another column, under Colonel Waugh, entered the country by a route nearly parallel to that of Colonel Lindesay, but to the north of his line of march, and penetrated to Merkara, though not without suffering very severely in forcing the passage. The country thus subdued was incorporated with the territory of the East-India Company, and the deposed rajah deported to Benares. The annexation of his dominions to those of the British was almost unavoidable, no male branch of the royal house remaining alive to become a claimant of sovereignty. The ex-rajah receives an annual stipend of 60,000 rupees.\n\nCOORLA.\u2014A town in the British district of Ganjam, presidency of Madras, 26 miles W. of Ganjam.

It takes a course first south-west for about sixty miles, then winds south and south-east for 160 more, to lat. 26\u00b0 45', long. 87\u00b0 13', its place of exit from the mountains, from which it descends \"by three cataracts, or rather violent rapids.\" About thirty miles above that place, it on the left side receives the Arun, a great torrent, which, rising in Thibet, flows through a valley dividing the main\nrange of the Himalayas, thus receiving the drainage of both faces of the Snowy Mountains. About ten miles from its junction with the Arun it also receives, on the left side, the Tambur, which rises on the southern face of the Himalaya, and flows through Nepal for about 100 miles, to its confluence. At the place of its exit from the mountains, the Coosy appears to be a greater stream than the Ganges at Hurdwar, and is nowhere fordable, in ordinary years, in its course through the plains. In the upper part of its course, near the mountains, the water, even in summer, retains considerable coolness, and the stream is subject to sudden rise and fall; but it is navigable for small boats downwards from the last cataract. It there takes a southern course, and in lat. $26^\\circ 37'$, long. $87^\\circ 12'$, fifteen miles lower down, it touches on the British territory, and forms the boundary between it and Nepal for ten miles, when it enters the British district of Purnea, through which it holds a course due south for eighty miles, to its confluence with the Ganges, in lat. $25^\\circ 19'$, long. $87^\\circ 19'$; its total length of course being about 325 miles. During its course through the level alluvial tract of Purnea, it sends off numerous branches, and receives but one considerable stream\u2014the Gogaree, which, flowing from the N.W., joins it on the right side, ten miles above its confluence with the Ganges. Notwithstanding this great loss of volume, it is everywhere a very large stream, having a channel one and a half to two and a half miles wide, with many shoals and islands, through which the river forces its way, forming many alterations among them during its inundations. Even where narrowest, Buchanan found it, when lowest, to have a stream 1,200 feet wide and fifteen deep. From those particulars it may be concluded to be larger than the Jumna, and even the Ghogra.\n\nCOOTCOTTAH.\u2014A town in the native state of Hyderabad, or dominions of the Nizam, 82 miles S.W. from Hyderabad, and 35 miles N. from Kurnool.

Lat. 23\u00b0 52', long. 90\u00b0 53'.\n\nCORINGA,\u00b9 in the British district of Rajahmundry, presidency of Madras, a town on the estuary of that branch of the Godavery\u00b2 which opens into Coringa Bay, and which is generally called the Coringa River, its mouth forming the harbour of Coringa. At the entrance is a bar, having twelve or fourteen feet of water at spring tides. Within the bar the depth of water is from two and a half to four fathoms. The town, which is a place of considerable trade, is situate on the south side of the estuary. It is the best place on this coast for building or repairing small vessels, there being a considerable number of shipwrights and calkers, who here find constant employment. The place, however, from its low situation, is subject to be overflowed by extraordinary rises of the sea, and in May,\u00b3 1787, in consequence of a prolonged and very violent gale from the north-east, the sea rushed over the site of the town, swept away all the houses, and in a moment destroyed nearly the whole population, estimated at about four thousand. The deluge\u2074 overspread the adjacent country for several miles inland, destroying, as is estimated, fifteen thousand people, and upwards of a hundred thousand head of cattle. A similar\u2075 disaster occurred in 1832, when several vessels were carried into the fields and left aground in elevated situations; one\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C.

Lat. 18\u00b0 24', long. 84\u00b0 3'.\n\nCOROMANDEL (COAST OF).\u2014Part of the eastern coast of Southern India, forming the shore of the Bay of Bengal. It is considered to commence at Point Calimere, in lat. 10\u00b0 17', long. 79\u00b0 56', and to hold a direction nearly due north as far as Gondegam, in lat. 15\u00b0 20', long. 80\u00b0 10'.* It extends across the estuaries of many rivers, and the entrance to the extensive Pulicat lake or inlet; but there is no place within its whole extent where large ships can be sheltered in all weather. Blackwood Harbour,^ the least objectionable, is open to the north, on which point it might be sheltered by a breakwater; the construction of such a work, however, though practicable, would be enormously expensive. Of the several other places frequented by shipping, none have havens, and ships must be anchored in the open sea, where, during the closing months of the year, they are exposed to the violence of the north-east monsoon. Consequently, the coast is then nearly deserted; and the few navigators who venture to anchor, must be prepared to weigh, cut or slip anchor, and work out to sea on the first setting in of a gale. At all times a heavy sea rolls on shore from the vast expanse of the Bay of Bengal, and causes a tremendous surf, which totally precludes communication from the ships lying at anchor with the land by means of boats constructed on the European plan. These would inevitably be dashed to pieces; and resort is therefore had to the Masula boats,^ which are flat-bottomed, of the same shape at stem and stern, from thirty to thirty-five feet in length, ten or eleven in breadth, and seven or eight in depth. The planks which form those boats are sewed together with coir yarns, or twine spun from the cocoanut-fibre, crossing the seams over a wadding of the same fibre, which presses on the joints and prevents leakage.\n\n* To the coast, within these limits, Horsburgh considers the term Coromandel Coast in strict propriety confined; but, by license, it is sometimes extended, so as to include the coast further northward to Balasore.\nCOR.\n\nThe places principally frequented by shipping on the Coromandel Coast are Negapatam, Nagore, Tranquebar, Cuddalore, Pondicherry, Sadras, Madras, and Pulicat. The coast throughout is, with little exception, low and sandy, and the sea shallow near the shore, with sounding gradually increasing with the distance from land.\n\nThe etymology of the name Coromandel has been variously explained; but it appears that it was originally denominated Choramandal or Cholamandal, which is considered to mean the mandal or region of the Chola, an ancient dynasty of this part of India.* The Coromandel Coast comprises the sea-coasts of the British districts Tanjore, Arcot, Chingleput, and Nellore.\n\nCORONGE.\u2014An island about two miles in length from north to south, situate close to a rocky point off the coast of Arracan, which forms a bay, having several rocks and islets. Distant from Cape Negrals, N., 33 miles. Lat. $16^\\circ 32'$, long. $94^\\circ 20'$.\n\nCORYGAUM.\u2014A village in the British district of Poona, presidency of Bombay, on the route from Poona to Ahmednuggur, 16 miles N.E. from the former. The place is unimportant, but is associated with interesting historical recollections. On the 1st January, 1818, a British force, under the command of Captain Staunton, comprising a detail of artillery, a battalion of infantry, and a small number of auxiliary horse, occupied the village, in which they were attacked by three divisions of the Peishwa's infantry, consisting of about 1,000 men each, supported by immense bodies of horse. The action lasted from noon till nine in the evening, during which period several buildings were repeatedly taken and retaken. On both sides the loss was terrific; but the result was most honourable to the British, who remained masters of the place. In recognition of the gallantry displayed on the occasion by Captain Staunton, a grant of 500l. per annum was conferred upon him by the East-India Company. Lat. $18^\\circ 39'$, long. $74^\\circ 8'$.\n\nCORTAGERBY.\u2014A town in the native state of Mysore, 47 miles N.W. from Bangalore, and 84 miles N.E. from Seringapatam.

Lat. 11\u00b0 33', long. 77\u00b0 35'.\n\nCOSSIMBAZAR, in the British district of Moorshedabad, presidency of Bengal, a town adjoining the city of Moorshedabad on the south, and in fact a suburb of it. The Bhagirathi, a great offset of the Ganges, here forms, by its winding, a peninsula, at one time insulated, and thence denominated the Island of Cossimbazar. The manufactures of this town were formerly of importance, especially of silk fabrics; but they have much decayed before the irresistible competition of the cheaper wares of Britain. A considerable quantity of silk being produced in the surrounding country, it is generally here prepared for market. Here was formerly a considerable factory, belonging to the East-India Company. In 1756 it was taken, without resistance, by Sooraj-oo-dowla, nawaub of Bengal. By a careful census in 1829, the number of houses was stated at 1,300; of inhabitants, at 3,538; of which 1,325 Mussulman, 2,213 Brahminical. Distance N.E. from Calcutta by land, through Berhampore, 120 miles; by water, 163. Lat. 24\u00b0 8', long. 88\u00b0 18'.\n\nCOSSIPORE.\u2014A manufacturing suburb of Calcutta, situate on the left bank of the river Hooghly, six miles north of Fort William. Here is located the government foundry, represented as one of the most complete and perfect to be seen in any country. During the administration of Lord Hastings, several pieces of brass ordnance cast at this place were sent to England, and submitted to the examination of a committee of artillery officers at Woolwich, who pronounced the workmanship and finish superior to those of the royal arsenal. Young artillery officers are now required to attend at this establishment for instruction in the casting of guns.\n\n* Market of Cossim; from Cossim, a proper name, and Bazar, \"market.\" It might have been conjectured that it was named after Cossim Ali, the nawaub of Bengal, expelled by the British, 1763, were it not that it is described by Tavernier as an important place a century earlier. It is the Cossimbazar of Thornton; Cossimbuzar of Rennell.\n\n\u2020 Hamilton states that this peninsula abounds in wild swine, deer, hares, feathered game, and even tigers. But it is only about 1,000 acres in extent, and is close to the towns of Moorshedabad and of Cossimbazar. He farther states that it is one of the largest inland trading towns in Bengal.\nCOSSYAH HILLS.\n\nwhen in full work, is capable of turning out more than 200 pieces in the year. Lat. 22\u00b0 38', long. 88\u00b0 26'.\n\nCOSSYAH HILLS embrace the tract of country lying between Assam and Sylhet on the north and south, and Jynteah and the Garrow country on the east and west, and extend from lat. 25\u00b0 to 26\u00b0 7', and from long. 90\u00b0 52' to 92\u00b0 11'. The area of the country is estimated at 729 square miles, and the amount of the population at 10,935. This mountainous region is considered to be advantageously situate as an almost impregnable military post for the north-eastern frontier, arising from its occupying the centre in a line of operations which might be directed against an eastern enemy, and from its possessing natural bulwarks, requiring little aid to render them impenetrable. The Cossyah Hills have been usually regarded as containing much mineral wealth; but the result of their recent geological survey by Professor Oldham does not favour this presumption; neither iron, stone, nor coal, appearing to be abundant.\n\nThe great body of Cossyahs have not adopted the customs of the Hindoos; they eat beef, and have, apparently, few religious notions. They have neither idols nor temples; but many peculiarly-shaped stones and rocks, as well as streams and groves, are accounted holy; and sacrifices are made to them. Near the villages, on the hills, are likewise to be seen gigantic stone monuments, with doorways, that remind the English visitor of Stonehenge, and are conjectured to have been erected to the memory of departed chiefs and rajahs.\n\nIn 1826, a direct communication between Assam and Sylhet being considered desirable, an agreement, concurred in by the Cossya chiefs, was concluded with the chief of Nungklow, under which, in return for British protection against external enemies, and support in the event of internal insurrection, the rajah stipulated to afford a free passage to British troops passing between Assam and Sylhet; to furnish materials for the construction of a road, and to govern his subjects according to established laws. Teerut Singh, with whom this engagement was made, having caused Lieutenants Bedingfield and Burlton to be treacherously massacred, was deposed in 1829, when the district of Nungklow was conferred upon his nephew; and engagements were at the same time entered into with the rajah\nof Chirra Poonjee, and the other principal chiefs of the country. A few years later the complete establishment of tranquillity was effected in the Cossyah highlands; and the salutary change was ascribed to the substitution of mild for coercive measures, and especially to the restoration of the son of Teerut Singh to the principality forfeited by his father.\n\nCOTA POLOOR.\u2014A town in the British district of North Arcot, presidency of Madras, 49 miles N.W. of Madras. Lat. 13\u00b0 45', long. 80\u00b0 4'.\n\nCOTHA, or KOTA, in the British district of Jaunsar, a village near the right bank of the Jumna, and about 3,000 feet above its bed. At the time of Hodgson's visit in 1817, it was a poor place, containing about a dozen houses and 100 inhabitants; but it is now much improved, being a neat village, and uncommonly clean, surrounded with thriving cultivation, and possessed of much cattle. It is also a place of great thoroughfare, being on the direct route from the plains to Jumnotri, and also to Theog and Kotgurh.

Lat. 13\u00b0 43', long. 75\u00b0 10'.\n\nCOURTALLUM, in the British district of Tinnevelly, a small town at the western boundary, towards the territory of Travancore. It is situate in a small recess, in the east side of that great group of mountains in which the southern extremities of the Western and Eastern Ghauts unite; and the site of the town is surrounded on three sides by hills. At this place the group is traversed by a deep narrow valley, allowing an easy communication between the Carnatic and Malabar. The dryness of the air and its low temperature, arising from local peculiarities, have deservedly acquired for this spot a character for salubrity; and it is, consequently, much frequented by invalids during the hot weather. In addition to more substantial advantages, it may be mentioned that the scenery is described as being \"rich and varied, and the whole enlivened...\"\nwith a series of beautiful waterfalls, forming a *tout ensemble*, the contemplation of which is highly grateful to the eye and soothing to the feelings. The lowest and most conspicuous of the series of waterfalls is nearly 200 feet in height, the water of which being much broken in its descent, forms a favourite bathing-place, where the bathers enjoy the benefit of a shower-bath on the grandest scale.\" The vegetable kingdom is here peculiarly comprehensive, rich, and varied, including forest trees of enormous size, date-palms and sago-palms, wild nutmeg, a coarse species of cinnamon, wild mango-steen, jak (Artocarpus integrifolia), various twiners, such as the Cocculus indicus (pepper-vine). The arrow-root plant grows to the height of from twenty to twenty-five feet; the ferns attain the size of moderate timber-trees. The number of flowering indigenous vegetables is estimated at 2,000. The soil and climate, so favourable to vegetation, have caused this place to be selected for the attempt to cultivate some of the rarest and most valuable intertropical exotics, including the nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon. All of them are represented as thriving, though the undertaking does not appear to have been pushed so as to afford as yet any beneficial commercial result. Elevation above the sea 700 feet. Distance from Tinnevelly town, N.W., 32 miles; Madras, S.W., 350. Lat. 8\u00b0 56', long. 77\u00b0 20'.\n\nCOVELONG,\u00b9 in the British district of Chingleput, presidency of Madras, a town on the Coromandel Coast. It is of dangerous approach from the south and south-east, in consequence of a rocky shoal\u00b2 projecting upwards of a mile into the sea in that direction. Here are the ruins of a fort,\u00b3 formerly belonging to the Imperial East-India Company of Ostend, but subsequently acquired by the English, who dismantled it. The locality of Covelong appears to be peculiarly favourable for the production of salt, and it is stated that a pure white description of this article may be manufactured here at the low rate of four shillings and sixpence per ton.\u2074 Distance from Cuddalore, N.E., 80 miles; Arcot, E., 62; Madras, S., 21.

Lat. 19\u00b0 50', long. 81\u00b0 5'.\n\nCRANGANORE.\u00b9\u2014A town of Malabar, with a fort. It is situate\u00b2 on the Cranganore River, called also the Aycotta River. The river has a bar at the entrance, with five or six feet water on it: inside, there are fourteen or sixteen. The place was taken, in 1662\u00b3 or 1663, from the Portuguese, by the Dutch, who appear to have constructed the fort. In 1789, it was purchased from the Dutch by the rajah of Travancore; in the following year, possession\u2074 of it was taken by Tippoo Sultan; and at the general pacification which closed the war provoked by the sultan's attack upon Travancore, it was ceded to the British. In this part of India are many Jews; and one section of that extraordinary people, termed White Jews, claim a peculiar connection with Cranganore. According to their account,\u2075 their ancestors escaped from Jerusalem at the time of its final destruction, and after various migrations, the descendants of the fugitives made their way to the western coast of India, where, in the year of the world 4250, or 490 of the Christian era, the local sovereign granted them a settlement at Cranganore, where they were joined by others of their nation, and in which place they remained about a thousand years; but, as one of their number stated,\u2076 \"discord arising among ourselves, one of our chiefs called to his assistance an Indian king, who came upon us with a great army, destroyed our houses, palaces, and\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C.

By a course of cruel persecution, the greater part of the Syrian believers were constrained to acknowledge the authority of the papal see, which is exercised by the bishop of Cranganore and vicar-general of Malabar.

It is embodied with Dera Ghazee Khan, and with it formed one of the districts of the late Sikh government, yielding it nine lacs of rupees annually. It is everywhere permeated by watercourses from the Indus, and is remarkably well cultivated and productive.

Lat. 15\u00b0 5', long. 76\u00b0 17'.\n\nCUDDALORE,1 the principal place of the southern division of Arcot, presidency of Madras, a town on the Coromandel Coast, situate at the estuary of the river Panar. The river, though having a considerable length of course, is small at its mouth, and closed up by a bar, so as only to admit coasting-craft of moderate size; but there is good anchorage off shore2 a mile and half. The site of the town is low, being not more than five feet above the sea; and, from this circumstance, the place might be supposed to be insalubrious; but such is not the case, and the new town especially is regarded as peculiarly healthy. The population are in general well lodged, and there are many good houses, arranged in broad regular streets. The\nold fort, now nearly demolished, is thus described:\u2014\"A quadrangle of unequal sides, with an indifferent rampart and ditch, and no outworks, excepting one advanced from its north-eastern angle: a bastion covers each of the other angles, and the curtains are furnished with the imperfect kind of flanking defence obtainable by means of a succession of bastions placed in a prolongation of one and the same straight line.\" The town is the principal civil station of the zillah or district. Distant from Madura, N.E., 170 miles; Tanjore, N.E., 77; Arcot, S.E., 84; Madras, S., 100. Lat. 11\u00b0 43', long. 79\u00b0 50'.\n\nCUDDAPAH.\u2014A British district under the presidency of Madras, named from the principal place within it. It is bounded on the north by Kurnool and the British district of Guntoor; on the east by the British districts Guntoor and Nellore; on the south-east by the British district of Arcot (the northern division); on the south-west by the territory of Mysore; and on the west by the British district of Bellary. It lies between lat. 13\u00b0 12'\u201416\u00b0 19', long. 77\u00b0 52'\u201479\u00b0 48', and comprehends an area officially returned at 12,970 square miles. The mountains of this district form an uninterrupted chain of great extent, consisting of numerous parallel and continuous ridges, which rise abruptly from the plains, and traverse the whole length of the district, constituting part of the Eastern Ghauts. The hill-ranges most worthy of note are those of the Nulla Mulla and Lanca Mulla to the east, and of Gurumcondah and Punganoor to the south. The former take a south by easterly course, by Cummum, to the town of Cuddapah: they thence proceed south-west to Bakrapett, ten miles from Cuddapah, where they separate into two ranges; one running south-east towards the celebrated hill-shrine of Tripetty, with peaks attaining in some instances a height of 3,500 feet above the level of the sea; the other running west, and becoming identified with another but lower range, which, taking its rise near the Toombuddra, runs in a semicircular direction by Bungunpully and Ghooty; thence turning south-east to Gundicotta, where it is intersected by a remarkable chasm, the sides of which are elevated upwards of 200 feet from the base, and through which the Pennar river flows. The general slope of the country is to the east; the plains eastward of Bellary and Gooty having an elevation of 1,182 feet, while the depression\nin which the town of Cuddapah is situate, is only 507 feet above the level of the sea; and the more eastern limit of the district has an average height of 450 feet. The numerous streams which intersect the district consequently flow in that direction, discharging themselves into the Bay of Bengal. The principal river is the Northern Pennar, which, rising on the north-west flank of the Nandidurg Mountain, flows northward into the British district of Bellary; subsequently turning eastward, it passes into this district, and, holding a course generally south-eastward for 110 miles, flows through the Eastern Ghauts to Somesaram, where it passes into the British district of Nellore. Though having an average breadth of nearly 300 feet, and during the periodical rains containing a large stream, it becomes during the dry season nearly devoid of water. Numerous torrents fall into it in its passage. On the right side, at Gundy Kot, it receives the Chitravati, rising in Mysore; on the same side, thirty-eight miles further down the stream, it is joined at Kamulapoor by the Paupugnee, flowing from the south-west; and at Gundlamudd, forty miles lower, by the Chittair. On the left side of the Pennar, its principal feeders are the Kundaur, joining it at a point about two miles above the confluence of the Paupugnee, and the Sugglair, joining about twenty miles lower down, at Mullailpatam. Like the Pennar, these are considerable torrents during the periodical rains, but during the dry season, they are either nearly or totally without water; and when they are in that state, the vegetable and animal substances in their channels are seriously injurious, by exhaling malaria, contributing to the origin and continuance of epidemics. The most prominent characteristics of the climate are great heat during the day, and oppressive closeness and stagnation of air during the night; and from these conditions of the atmosphere results its enervating influence on the European constitution. The average maximum temperature for several years has been found to be $98^\\circ$ in the shade; the mean for the whole year, in the shade, $81^\\circ$; the minimum $65^\\circ$. The year may be divided into three seasons. 1. The cool; 2. the hot and dry; 3. the hot and moist. The cool season commences in October, and continues until February. About the end of October the north-east monsoon sets in, thunderstorms and vivid lightning generally preceding\nthe heavy rain. This monsoon ends about the end of November, and during its continuance the wind is steady from the north-east, the weather exceedingly pleasant, and the whole country under cultivation; luxuriant crops attesting the fertility of the soil. The mean temperature throughout this season is stated at $77^\\circ$, and the maximum at $89^\\circ$; the atmosphere being remarkably clear. Towards the middle of February the weather begins to get hot, and Europeans cannot remain out of doors later than eight o'clock in the morning. The crops in the valleys are reaped in February, and as March advances, the wind sets in strongly from the east; grass is everywhere burned up, vegetation disappears, and the country becomes a parched dreary waste. In April the air is either perfectly calm, or moved only by light uncertain breezes during the day, followed by complete stillness during the night, when the temperature is kept up to a great height by radiation from the rocks in the hilly tracts. In May the heat is still greater, but its distressing effects are moderated by strong winds blowing from the west. The south-west monsoon commences early in June, being ushered in by tremendous thunderstorms, and continues to the early part of September; being characterized rather by steady and strong west winds, than by any great fall of rain, which is intercepted by the Western Ghauts, and precipitated on the table-lands extending from them eastward.\n\nThe geological formation of the mountains is generally primitive, consisting of granite, gneiss, and mica-slate; and in many places they are overlaid with sandstone, intermixed with veins of greenstone. In some places the sandstone rests on a limestone of a deep-blue colour; and such formations have been considered to afford promising indications of the existence of coal-fields. This sandstone is the matrix of most of the diamonds for which Golcondah has long been celebrated. About seven miles from the town of Cuddapah, between Chinnoor and a range of hills on either side of the Pennar river, are still to be seen the sites of several diamond-mines. \"They consist merely of pits rudely excavated, and surrounded with heaps of stones. The mines have not been worked of late; and from being known several centuries past, it is probable that they are quite exhausted.\" Heyne, however, states \"that the country is by no means exhausted, and that abundance of...\"\ndiamonds might be procured, should an increased demand for them arise.\" There are mines of iron, lead, and copper,\\(^1\\) in many of the hills; but with the exception of the first, scarcely any of them have been worked. The earth in many parts of the country is impregnated with saltpetre, carbonate of soda, and culinary salt, which by simple processes are extracted in large quantities by the native population. Those saline ingredients extensively deteriorate the water of the wells. The natives generally make use of river or tank water; but though more free from saline impregnations, it holds in suspension much earthy admixture, and is contaminated with decomposed animal and vegetable matter.\n\nMuch of the country is hilly, jungly, and intricate. Wild animals are numerous: they are principally the tiger, the bear, the leopard, the jackal, the fox, the hare, the elk, the antelope, the hog, the wolf, the hyena,\\(^2\\) the mongoose, the squirrel, the monkey (of which description of animal there are great numbers and many varieties), and the porcupine. Of birds there are the Indian eagle, the vulture, the hawk (in great numbers and variety), the paroquet, the dove, pea-fowl, jungle-fowl or common gallinaceous poultry, partridges, florikin, plovers, snipes, quails, bustards, storks, herons, gulls, wild-ducks, geese, teal, and pelicans. In other departments of zoology there are the fresh-water tortoise, the geometrically-shelled tortoise, the alligator, the iguana, the chameleon, and lizards of various kinds; the cobra di capello and whip-snake, the rock-snake, and the green-snake; the honey-bee, the silkworm, and the lac insect.\n\nOf trees the most remarkable and valuable are the teak, blackwood, cocoanut-palm, date-palm, palmyra, babul or Acacia arabica, nim or margosa, and bamboo.\n\nThe best soil is the regur, or black cotton-ground, in some places mingled more or less with calcareous matter, imparting to it a higher colour, and more open and friable texture. The principal alimentary crops are rice, ragi (Eleusine corocana), bajra (Holcus spicatus), jowar (Holcus sorghum), chenna (Cicer arietinum), dhal (Citysus cajan), wheat, oil-seeds, and sugar-cane. Amongst the principal commercial crops may be mentioned tobacco, indigo, and kusum (Carthamus tinctorius). \"Cotton\\(^3\\) is cultivated to considerable extent in this district.\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Madras Rev Disp. 28 Oct. 1835.\n\n\\(^2\\) Madras Journal of Literature and Science, x. 123\u2014Newbold, Account of the Ceded Districts.\n\n\\(^3\\) Report on Cotton Wool in India, 412.\nCUDDAPAH.\n\nThe most common fruits are the mango, tamarind, plantain, and water-melon. Less abundant are the guava, peach, lime, citron, jack, pomegranate, and grape.\n\nSuch manufacturing industry as is found, is employed on cotton piece-goods, muslins, blankets, and other coarse woollens; in the preparation and use of indigo and other dyes; in the working of gold, silver, and other metals; and in pottery.\n\nThe exports consist of cotton piece-goods, coarse woollens, a small quantity of silken fabrics, sugar, grain, and tobacco: the imports are betel, iron, steel, copper, and some other articles of less importance.\n\nThe language spoken is the Canarese. The population, according to official return, amounts to 1,451,921. Of these about one-eighth are represented to be Mussulmans, the rest Hindoos; of which latter description a considerable number are of the Brahmin caste. Artisans, tradesmen, agriculturists, and shepherds are generally Hindoos, as few Mussulmans like those occupations, preferring service either in the army or police.\n\nThe principal road lies in a direction from south-east to north-west, and leading from Madras to Cuddapah, and thence to Bellary. There are also routes of inferior description.\n\n1. From south to north, from the cantonment of Cuddapah to Hyderabad, through the Murkondah Pass. 2. From east to west, from Nellore to the cantonment of Cuddapah. 3. From north-east to south-west, from the cantonment of Cuddapah to Bangalore.\n\nThe principal places\u2014Cuddapah, the locality of the military and civil establishments of the district, Sidhout or Siddawattan, and Rachuti or Roychoty\u2014are described under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nIn 1846 this collectorate was the scene of serious disturbances, originating, it is believed, in a feeling of distrust towards the government, occasioned by the adoption of measures affecting the prescriptive rights of landed property. These, however, were speedily suppressed; and the home authorities, upon the subject being brought before them, having directed that long undisturbed possession should be regarded as sufficient evidence of the existence of such rights, the district shortly after resumed its wonted tranquillity.\nThe Ceded Districts, of which Cuddapah forms the eastern division, came into the possession of the East-India Company in the year 1800, by a treaty concluded with the Nizam, subsequently to the partition of the dominions of Tippoo Sultan.\n\nCUDDAPAH, situate in the British district of the same name, under the presidency of Madras, a military cantonment five miles south-west of the right bank of the Northern Pennar or Pennaur, and immediately on the banks of the river Bogawunka. The cantonment is on a declivity, rising gently from the latter river, and contains two barracks for the accommodation of Europeans, substantially built of brick and lime mortar, lying parallel to each other, each extending about sixty feet in length by sixteen in breadth; and spacious lines for native infantry, besides an hospital, and other requisite buildings. The military force stationed here amounts to about 1,000 men. Here are also the civil establishment for the district, and the jail, which is situate nearly in the centre of an old fort, and has a slightly elevated site, considered to be salubrious. It was erected in 1813, and consists of several buildings in separate and spacious enclosures, suited for the classification of the inmates. Elevation above the sea 507 feet.

It consists of forty or fifty houses\u00b2 solidly built of stone, bonded with squared beams of timber, the exterior of which is grotesquely carved with images of Hindoo deities. There are a few small patches of tolerably level and fertile ground about the village, and on those is cultivated grain\u00b3 sufficient for the population. This sequestered spot is inclosed on the west, north, and east\u2074 by the Himalaya, and on the south by a lofty mountain clothed in forests; so that it is sheltered from the violence of the mountain gusts, and even when the surface as far as the eye can reach is under snow, is no uncomfortable abode.

Its limits, inclusive of the great salt marsh termed the Runn, extend from lat. 22\u00b0 47' to 24\u00b0 40', and from long. 68\u00b0 26' to 71\u00b0 45'. Its greatest length from east to west is 205 miles, and its breadth from north to south (which is nearly equal throughout its whole extent) 110 miles. The area, exclusive of the Runn, is 6,764\u00b2 square miles, and its population is returned at 500,536. This long narrow tract, interposed between the desert and the sea, forms a connecting link between Guzerat and Sinde. Two mountain-ranges intersect the country. The principal, termed the Lunkhi, nearly bisects the province from east to west; the other runs in a parallel direction, but more to the northward. Both are of moderate height. The most remarkable hill of the range first mentioned, is the Nunow, rising from the centre of the province, and well known to navigators from its height and sugar-loaf form. The northern chain is in like manner distinguished by the Judria, a hill of similar form, from the materials of which are fabricated the millstones of Cutch. Indications of volcanic action are observable along the bases of the hills, where an extensive surface is overlaid with basaltic eruptions, and the rocks bear evidence of having been rent asunder by the effects of fire. Earthquakes have, indeed, been experienced to a very recent period, showing that these operations have not yet ceased. In July, 1819, a severe shock was felt throughout Cutch, the effects of which were so violent that every fortification in the country was shaken to its foundations, and several hundreds of the inhabitants perished. Among the remarkable phenomena of this convulsion of nature, were the upheaving of an enormous mound of earth and sand many miles in extent, and the simultaneous submersion of an adjacent tract of country. Allah Band, or the Band of God, is the name which has been given by the natives to the mound, in allusion to its not being the work of man.\n\nThough the province is of small dimensions, and sterile in its character, owing to the sandy nature of the soil, there are, notwithstanding, several fertile tracts. These are chiefly comprised in the valley between the two mountain-ranges already noticed, and in the extensive plain stretching south of the\n\n---\n\nFootnotes:\n1 Trigonometrical Survey Report, 1850.\n2 Parliamentary Return, 1851.\n3 Elphinstone, Hist. of India, i. 3.\n4 Trans.

On the opposite, or northern side of the province, beyond the second range of mountains, the entire frontier is fringed by a broad belt of luxuriant pasturage, called the Bhunni.\n\nLike Sinde, of which Cutch probably once formed part, the country is characterized by a deficiency of water. During the prevalence of the south-west monsoon, numerous torrents descend from the mountains, both in a northerly and southerly direction; but there are no permanent rivers in the province, the beds of the streams becoming dry with the cessation of the rains. No reliance, moreover, can be placed upon any considerable supply from tanks or artificial lakes, insomuch as, owing to the porous character of the subsoil, such reservoirs are quickly exhausted by filtration. Wells, however, are abundant, and excellent water is obtained by penetrating the rock underlying the more recent formations.\n\nSome mineral productions are obtainable in Cutch. Coal and iron have both been found, the former at Jamutra and the latter in the vicinity of Bhooj. Alum is obtained in considerable quantities by boiling the waters of the mountain springs in the neighbourhood of Lukput, whence it is exported, chiefly to Bombay, for the purposes of dyeing. There is a scarcity of timber both on the mountains and in the plains: the former are covered with low brushwood; but the trunks of decayed trees, constantly met with in the Lunkhi range, induce the belief that its sides were formerly clothed with forests. Plantations of peepul and babool occasionally surround the villages; the date-tree is more common, but the mango, banyan, and tamarind are rare. Of commercial crops, cotton is the principal; the soil of the most productive tracts being peculiarly favourable to the growth of this staple article. Sugar-cane is cultivated, but its quality is represented as inferior. Jowar, bajree, and the common grains of India, are the chief alimentary products. Though the country boasts of no great variety of fruits, none surpass it in the excellence of its grapes and musk-melons. Among the domestic animals, the horse is held in high estimation: it is remarkable for a bony head and cheeks, a thin and long neck, and large sparkling eye, with small soft\nCUTCH.\n\nKine, though of inferior breed, are abundant, as are also buffaloes and camels. The wild animals are, the tiger, leopard, wolf, hy\u00e6na, jackal, and fox. The wild ass roams in the Runn. This salt marsh consists of two principal portions, the larger bounding Scinde on the south-east, and the smaller being connected at its western extremity with the Gulf of Cutch. The Great Runn extends between lat. $23^\\circ 22'$\u2014$24^\\circ 42'$, long. $69^\\circ 50'$\u2014$71^\\circ 20'$; is about 160 miles in length from east to west, and 80 in breadth from north to south. Its area is estimated by Burnes \"at the enormous space of 7,000 square miles.\" Throughout this wide expanse there are, however, several islands, or more elevated tracts, and some of considerable extent. Burnes does not consider the term marsh a correct appellation for this singular tract. He points out that \"it has none of the characteristics of one; it is not covered or saturated with water but at certain periods; it has neither weeds nor grass in its bed, which, instead of being slimy, is hard, dry, and sandy, of such a consistency as never gives way, unless a long continuance of water on any individual spot have converted it into clay, which is rare; nor is it otherwise fenny or swampy. It is in reality but the dried-up bottom of an extensive inland sea, which, from having once been overwhelmed with water, more readily receives what flows into it, from being lower than other parts of the country.\" Burnes conjectures that the desiccation of the bed of this conjectural sea has resulted from its elevation by the upheaving of the earth, caused by one of those earthquakes so common in this part of India. To such an origin he attributes the saltiness of the Runn, as well as to numerous saline streams flowing into it from the north and north-east. \"So salt is the Runn, that it is often encrusted with it an inch deep, the water having been evaporated by the sun; and even lumps of salt may be picked up as large as a man's fist, and beautifully crystallized.\" During the monsoon, the Runn is flooded by sea-water blown into it, as well as by fresh water derived from the rains, or discharged into it by the various swollen rivers. In the dry season, fresh water is never to be had anywhere, except on the islands or rocky elevated spots; and there it is scarce. The Runn is throughout devoid of herbage, and vegetable life is discernible only occasionally in a tamarisk-bush, growing by\nCUTCH.\n\nmeans of the rain-water falling near it. The sirab, or mirage, prevails here very vividly, and highly magnifies objects, so that patches of shrubs sometimes resemble forests, and wild asses, the only quadrupeds to be seen in this desolate tract, appear as large as elephants. During the dry season, when the sun shines, the Runn may be mistaken for a great expanse of water, in consequence of the reflection of light from the glazed saline surface. Flies are so numerous on the Runn, that it is almost impossible to breathe without swallowing some; and though they do not bite, it is very difficult to force a horse through their swarms. The smaller Runn is situate between the territory of Cutch and that of Guzerat, and communicates with the Great Runn, at the south-east of which it lies, by a narrow strip of similar formation. It extends between lat. $23^\\circ 5'$\u2014$23^\\circ 45'$, long. $70^\\circ 45'$\u2014$71^\\circ 50'$, and in outline approaches an isosceles triangle, the base of which extends from east to west about 70 miles, the area being about 1,600 square miles. The western extremity of the base adjoins the eastern extremity of the Gulf of Cutch. These two saline wastes differ little from each other in their physical qualities, and few tracts of similar magnitude are so totally unproductive, salt being the only valuable commodity obtainable from them.\n\nThe political relations of the East-India Company and the government of Cutch first assumed a formal character in 1809. The articles of agreement then entered into were four, relating respectively to the protection of Guzerat from aggression on the part of Cutch; the settlement of certain claims of the Rao of Cutch on territory lying on the Guzerat side of the gulf; the suppression of piracy, and the exclusion from Cutch of Europeans and Americans. Some of these articles appear to have been but inadequately observed on the part of the rulers and people of Cutch, and in 1815 it became necessary for the British government to take hostile proceedings. The result was, the conclusion, in January, 1816,\\(^1\\) of a treaty, embodying and rendering more stringent the provisions of the former articles, and containing arrangements for the limitation of the employment of Arab mercenaries in Cutch, for the receipt of military aid from the British government, and for other purposes. By one article of this treaty, the fort of Anjar, with certain villages, were conveyed to the British government;\n\n\\(^1\\) Treaties and Engagements with Foreign Powers.\nbesides which, the Rao bound himself to an annual payment of a stipulated sum. By another, he engaged to make good the losses sustained from the depredations of the people of Cutch in Kattywar, and also to defray the military expenses rendered necessary by these outrages. But by a supplemental treaty, dated the 18th June, 1816, the British government released the Rao from the payment of the military charges\u2014upwards of 80,000\u00a3., and also from the annual tribute. Thus matters stood till 1819, when, in consequence of his misgovernment, the Rao was deposed, and his infant son raised to the throne. By treaty, dated the 13th October, in the last-mentioned year, the previous treaty was confirmed, so far as it was unaltered by the new one, a council of regency was appointed to act during the minority of the Rao, and, among other points, stipulations were made for the maintenance of a British force for the defence of Cutch, at the discretion of the British government; for prohibiting negotiation with any chief or state, except by permission; for the adjustment of disputes by the arbitration of the British, and for mutual freedom of trade between British ports and those of Cutch. In May, 1822, the arrangements of the treaty of 1816 were modified by a new treaty, under which the territorial cessions made by the Rao in 1816 were restored, in consideration of a pecuniary equivalent. The sum fixed, 88,000 rupees per annum, was subsequently thought too large, and in 1832 the arrears, amounting to a considerable sum, were remitted, and all future payments on this account relinquished. The subsidy thenceforward payable for the military force stationed in Cutch was fixed at 2,00,000 rupees per annum, subject to reduction in the event of a diminution of the force; and in case the latter should be altogether withdrawn, or so reduced that the charge should not exceed the amount of the Anjar compensation, viz. 88,000 rupees, then that amount only to be demandable.\n\nIn December, 1835, it was discovered that a considerable traffic in slave children was carried on between Arabia and the ports of Cutch. The British government resolved to take measures for its suppression, whereupon the Rao issued a proclamation prohibiting the inhuman practice. Under the influence of British counsel, various other measures of a salutary and beneficent character have been adopted; suttet\nhas been abolished, and the complete suppression of infanticide is anticipated. The revenue of the Rao amounts to 7,38,423 rupees, or 73,842l., and the military force maintained by him consists of a body of irregular horse, in no way subject to the control of the British government.\n\nA number of feudatory chiefs, boasting descent with the Rao from a common ancestor, enjoy an amount of revenue, and exercise unlimited authority within their respective domains. Of these chiefs, the following account is given by a former governor of Bombay:\n\n\"The family of these chiefs is derived at a recent period from Tatta in Sind, and they all sprung from a common ancestor, Humeerjee, whose son, Rao Khengar, acquired the sovereignty of Cutch before the middle of the sixteenth century of our era.\n\n\"The number of these chiefs is at present about 200, and the whole number of their tribe in Cutch is guessed at 10,000 or 12,000 persons. This tribe is called Jhareja. It is a branch of the Rajputs. The Rao's ordinary jurisdiction is confined to his own demesne, each Jhareja chief exercising unlimited authority within his lands. The Rao can call on the Jharejas to serve him in war; but must furnish them with pay at a fixed rate while they are with his army. He is the guardian of the public peace, and as such chastises all robbers and other general enemies. It would seem that he ought likewise to repress private war, and to decide all disputes between chiefs; but this prerogative, though constantly exerted, is not admitted without dispute. Each chief has a similar body of kinsmen, who possess shares of the original appanage of the family, and stand in the same relation of nominal dependence to him that he bears to the Rao. These kinsmen form what is called the bhyaud or brotherhood of the chiefs, and the chiefs themselves compose the bhyaud of the Rao.\"\n\nCUTTACK, a British province, named from its principal place, lies within the presidency of Bengal, and is divided into three districts: the northern, or Balasore; the central, or Cuttack proper; and the southern, or Pooree. It is bounded on the north by the British districts of Midnapore and Hijellee; on the north-west by the petty native states known\nCUTTACK.\n\nas the Cuttack Mehals; on the west by the Mehals and the British district of Ganjam; and on the east and south-east by the Bay of Bengal. It lies between lat. $19^\\circ 40'$\u2014$21^\\circ 45'$, long. $85^\\circ 8'$\u2014$87^\\circ 31'$, and has an area of 7,635 square miles. The seacoast, forming part of the north-western boundary of the Bay of Bengal, extends in a direction generally from southwest to north-east, from Priaghy, near the southern extremity of Chilka Lake or inlet, in lat. $19^\\circ 42'$, long. $85^\\circ 40'$, to a point seven miles east of the mouth of the river Soobunreeka, in lat. $21^\\circ 37'$, long. $87^\\circ 30'$. It is by seamen called the Orissa coast. In the southern part along the shore is a low, level expanse, beyond which inland appear several \"saddle hills,\" terminating a chain of mountains extending along the coast to the southward. Between those hills and the low sandy shore, is the extensive Chilka Lake or inlet, communicating with the sea by means of a narrow strait, in lat. $19^\\circ 42'$, long. $85^\\circ 40'$; at a short distance from which a sand-bank is said to project two miles into the sea, rendering dangerous the close approach of shipping to the coast. The navigator, continuing his course to the north-east, is struck by the appearance of Pooree, with its three pagodas of Juggernaut, at the mouth of the most southerly estuary of the Mahanuddee, and in lat. $19^\\circ 49'$, long. $85^\\circ 54'$. At this point commences the delta of the Mahanuddee, the shore of it extending north-east for eighty miles, to lat. $20^\\circ 35'$, long. $86^\\circ 40'$. It is low and swampy, resembling the Sunderbunds at the estuaries of the Ganges, being intersected by numerous sluggish winding streams, influenced by the tide, and infested by innumerable alligators of great size and voracity. The soil is in general a deep mud, overgrown with coarse grass and brushwood, and containing many morasses, quagmires, and quicksands, perplexing and dangerous to travellers. The Black Pagoda, another vast monument of Brahminical superstition, is seen on the coast nineteen miles north-east of the temples of Juggernaut. Further onwards is False Bay, having at its extremity two points, the southernmost known as False Point, the other as Point Palmiras, and also called True Point. Point Palmiras is a low sandy tongue of land, covered with Palmira palms, and having on each side a channel, each the mouth of the river Brahmunnee, that to the south being navigable for small coasting craft. It does not\nappear that any of the numerous estuaries of the Mahanuddee are navigable for vessels of any considerable size. Above Point Palmiras, the coast takes a direction which forms the extensive bay, terminated by the south-westernmost banks at the mouth of the Hooghly, and called by European seamen Balasore Roads. This bay \"affords\" good anchorage, the bottom being mostly stiff blue clay, intermixed with sand at times, or small stones.\" Inland, or westward of the low swampy maritime tract, extends the Moghalbandi, a dry tract, with a sandy soil, in general much mixed with gravel and calcareous conglomerate. It is for the most part hungry and unproductive, and large plains occur totally unfit for cultivation,\" where low stunted brushwood is the only specimen of vegetation. In the more favoured parts, however, there are fine groves of mango-trees, dense thickets of luxuriant bamboos, noble specimens of the banian (Ficus indica), and various wild flowering shrubs. Inland, and westward of this tract, and in some measure parallel to it, is the hill country, closing down towards the seacoast, in the vicinity of Chilka Lake, in the southern part of the district, and also at its northern extremity, where, near Balasore, a group of rocky picturesque hills project boldly to within sixteen or eighteen miles of the shore. These mountains, denominated Nilgiri* or Blue Hills, were, through a whimsical corruption of sounds, called by the earlier English navigators the Nelly Green Hills.8 In intermediate parts between those extremes, the distance of the highland from the coast increases in some places to sixty or seventy9 miles. The hills1 visible from the low country, between Point Palmyras and the Chilka Lake, occur generally in irregular, scattered groups, having peaked and waving summits, which seem to cross each other at all angles, or are isolated, conical, and wedge-shaped hills, wholly disconnected at their bases. They are all covered with vegetation to the top. The greatest height of those seen from the Moghulbandi is said to be 2,000 feet; but their ordinary elevation is less, varying from 300 to 1,200 feet. These highlands are represented to be, for the most part, of primitive formation, principally granite, so finely grained as in some measure to resemble\n\n* Nilgiri; from Nil, \"blue,\" and Giri, \"hill.\" These are the Nilgur Hills of Horsburgh.1\nCUTTACK.\n\nsandstone, and containing, disseminated throughout, vast quantities of imperfectly-formed garnets, with veins of steatite. The prevailing colour of the rock is red, and being diversified by the steatite, as above mentioned, it presents a very striking and singular appearance. Next to granite, the rock most abounding in this part of the district is that called laterite, or iron-clay, which is found in some instances combined with the granite so completely and intimately, as to render doubtful which was the inclosing substance. Iron is abundantly diffused throughout the whole of the Cuttack hills, in the state of pisiform iron-ore, earthy-red iron-ore, and ochrey-red iron-stone.\n\nAccording to popular report, gold dust is collected in the sands of some of the rivers; but the existence in the district of any metal, except iron, does not appear to have been ascertained.\n\nThe Mahanuddee, the principal river, rises near Shawa, in the district called Bustar, and flows, generally eastward, for a distance of 500 miles, to the town of Cuttack, where it divides into the numerous branches inclosing or traversing the delta; its total length of course being conjectured to be 580 miles. The discharge of the Mahanuddee is said to be observable for some distance at sea, pouring a current of fresh water, which flows like an independent stream on the surface of the salt water, from the greater specific gravity of the latter. The Brahmunnee, rising in Palamow, takes a direction generally south-east, to the western border of Cuttack, which it crosses about lat. 20\u00b0 50', long. 86\u00b0, and continuing its south-easterly course for about 100 miles farther, falls into the Bay of Bengal, close to Point Palmyras, in lat. 20\u00b0 43', long. 87\u00b0 5'. The Byturnee, rising in the hills of Orissa, after a very irregular course, crosses the western frontier of Cuttack, in lat. 21\u00b0 3', long. 86\u00b0 13', and continuing to flow through it south-eastwards for sixty miles, falls into the Bay of Bengal, in lat. 20\u00b0 49', long. 87\u00b0 3'. There are many other streams and torrents flowing from the mountains, all holding a course generally south-eastward, and falling into the Bay of Bengal, into the greater streams already described, or into the Chilka Jhil or lake. This shallow but extensive piece of water stretches, in the southern part of the district, for about forty-two miles in length, from north-east to\nCUTTACK.\n\nsouth-west, and sixteen in breadth, being for many miles divided from the sea merely by a strip of sand not more than 300 yards in width. It communicates with the sea by a narrow channel, and its water is saline, yielding, by means of solar evaporation, large quantities of culinary salt. It abounds with excellent fish. Numerous islands abridge the extent of water-surface; and where these do not intervene, the water is shallow. The general depth is only four or five feet, the greatest does not exceed six, and the lake is considered to be in the course of being rapidly filled up by the silt swept into it by the numerous torrents of which it is the reservoir.\n\nThe climate, in general, in the low alluvial tract along the seashore, is characterized by great insalubrity, resulting from the malaria of the swamps, which produces fevers and agues. The southern parts of the seacoast, however, in the vicinity of Pooree or Juggernath, and Kanarak or the Black Pagoda, having dry sandy soil, and during the greater part of the year being favoured with a brisk refreshing sea-breeze, enjoy a healthful climate, both in the hot and cold months, with a very bracing atmosphere during the latter; but in the rainy season the wind sets from the land, and renders the climate both unpleasant and unhealthy, as in most parts of India. The coast has sometimes been extensively inundated, in consequence of the level of the sea having been raised by violent hurricanes, of which one occurred in 1831, and another in the following year, when upwards of 20,000 human beings perished, and more than 50,000 head of cattle.\n\nThough the low tract along the coast is nearly devoid of timber-trees, they are numerous in the interior. The most important are the sal (Shorea robusta), which appears to be obtainable of useful size in any required quantity; the prysal (Buchanania latifolia), the gamhar (Gmelina arborea), sisu (Dalbergia sisu), the mango, the bur (Ficus indica), the pipal (Ficus religiosa), together with a vast variety of trees and shrubs, yielding drugs, dyes, and wild fruits relished by the natives. The woodlands also produce lac, wax, honey, and various kinds of resins.\n\nIn some parts of Cuttack there are wild elephants, supposed not to be indigenous, but to have sprung from domesticated individuals, which have escaped and relapsed into the wild.\nCUTTACK.\n\nstate. Of other wild animals, there are the tiger, panther, leopard, hyena, bear, jackal, otter, wild dog, wild swine, wild buffalo, deer, and antelope. There is also a gigantic bovine quadruped,\u2014the gayal, larger than the bull, having huge horns; and a large kind of antelope, called by the natives the gloranga, and resembling the nylgau (Antilope picta). There are also monkeys, the porcupine, and the ichneumon.\n\nBuffaloes are the most valuable domestic animals; the others, which are kine, sheep, swine, and goats, being of diminutive breeds. The principal crops are rice, jowar (Holcus sorghum), bajra (Holcus spicatus), raji (Eleusine corocana), oil-seeds, opium-poppy, tobacco, indigo, and cotton in small quantities. Some experimental attempts made to introduce improvement in the production of the last-named article failed, and were consequently abandoned. The manufactures are few and insignificant, being principally coarse cotton cloths, for the wear of the poor natives, a small quantity of fine muslins, and thick cotton quilts. The population has been stated officially at 2,127,555; an amount which, compared with the area, indicates a relative density of 279 to the square mile. The majority consists of Brahminists, not more than a tenth of the whole being Mussulmans. The Oorias of the plains are characterized as \"certainly the most mild, quiet, inoffensive, and easily-managed people in the Company's provinces.\" From this portion of the population are drawn the class of servants styled the Balasore bearers, in Calcutta and its vicinity, and in that capacity advantageously known for fidelity and honesty. Notwithstanding the testimony above quoted, the author following, Abul Fazel, gives on the whole a very unfavourable impression of the character of the population; but by a later authority its accuracy is impugned. \"The paiks, or landed militia of the rajwara,\" are said to combine, with the most profound barbarism and the blindest devotion to the will of their chiefs, a ferocity and unquietness of disposition, which have ever rendered them an important and formidable class of the population of the province.\" The total amount of this rude militia is estimated at 56,050.\n\nCommerce is in a very languid state, and appears on the whole to be declining. In Cuttack proper it can scarcely be said that any commerce exists; in Balasore it is very limited.\nCUTTACK.\n\nFrom the latter district rice is said to be exported in favourable seasons. Some other exports take place, but their value is very small; and it appears that, during a period of five years, the imports greatly exceeded them.\n\nCuttack is not one of the permanently settled districts, but a settlement has recently been effected for a term of years.\n\nCuttack and Balasore, as well as Koordah, Pooree, and Kanarak, the principal towns, are described under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe routes are\u20141. From north-east to south-west, from Calcutta, through the town of Cuttack to the Circars; 2. from the town of Cuttack to Kamptee and Nagpore; 3. from north to south, from the town of Cuttack to Pooree.\n\nCuttack was among the latest of the Mahomedan acquisitions in India. The decline of the ancient royal house of Orissa dates from the death, in 1524, of Rajah Pertab Rudra Deo, an event which the monarchy was not destined long to survive. Its downfall may be regarded as completed in 1592, when a lieutenant-governor arrived from the Mahomedan kingdom of Bengal to assume charge of the administration. From this time the province appears to have formed part of the possessions of the ruler of Bengal till 1750, when it was invaded by the Mahrattas, and became tributary to the rajah of Nagpore. The chout, or tribute, amounted to 40,000l. per annum. After the lapse of a few years, during which the resources of the country seem gradually to have decayed, difficulty was experienced in discharging the obligation; whereupon the Bengal chief proposed that he should be absolved from the stipulated payment, and that the rajah of Nagpore should take possession of the territory, and undertake its management through his own officers. The proposal being acceded to, the province of Cuttack, in 1756, passed to the Mahrattas. Under their administration it appears to have experienced the anarchy, and to have been subjected to the rapacity, which were the unfailing characteristics of their rule. During the Mahratta war of 1803, the occupation of Cuttack formed part of the British plan of military operations. This service was performed by Colonel Harcourt, who, having taken possession of Juggernaut, proceeded to reduce the fort of Barabuttee, situate about a mile from the town of Cuttack. Its capture took place on the 14th October, 1803, and the\nvictory was followed by the entire submission of the province. Among the results of the conquest was the subjection to British supremacy of the group of native states known as the Cuttack Mehalas. These are eighteen in number; viz. Angool, Autgur, Banky, Berumbah, Dhenkanaul, Hindole, Kundiapurra, Neelgur, Nursingpoor, Nyagur, Runpoor, Talchur, Tiggreah, Autmallik, Boad, Duspulla, Koonjerry, and Mohurbunge. In the aggregate they contain an area of 16,929 square miles, and a population of 761,805. Within this extensive tract the land fit for tillage bears a trifling proportion to the space occupied by rock and jungle, or covered by forests producing the finest timber. The sal-tree is particularly sought after, from the size it attains, especially in the hill state of Duspulla, whence is procured the timber annually required for the car of Juggernaut. Many years since a British superintendent was appointed, with a view to establish such a control over the conduct of the rajahs as might prevent the commission of crimes and outrages. The abolition of suttee is one of the beneficial measures arising from this appointment.\n\nCUTTACK.\u2014The principal place of a British district of the same name under the presidency of Bengal. \u201cThe extent, appearance, and population of the town,\u201d says an observer, \u201care not unsuitable to its rank as the capital of a large province. Its situation on a tongue of land or peninsula near the bifurcation of the Mahanuddee is commanding in a political and commercial point of view, though these advantages have been in some degree counterbalanced by the outlay incurred in defending it by stone revetments from the encroachments of the rivers which wash two of its sides.\u201d The fortifications are in a ruinous state, and their materials are fast disappearing, the stones being carried away and used in various public works, among others in the lighthouse at False Point, and in the macadamization of the cantonment roads. This old fort, says a recent observer, \u201cdeviates little from a regular parallelogram, having its longest faces to the north and south, the river running parallel with the former, at a short distance from it. The walls were originally defended by high square bastion towers projecting at different distances: the place could never\n\n* Kattak of Brigge's Index; Cottack of Rennell.\nat any time have offered much resistance, as the walls were barely five feet thick on the three land faces, which a six-pound shot could have perforated.\" On the river face, however, they were not only of great height but of proportional thickness. \"There is only one gateway, and that in the centre of the eastern face. It is narrow, and between two square towers, like the others wide at the base, and decreasing towards their summit. The archway is of comparatively modern date, and is the work of the Mogul government of the province. There was an inner gateway, which was taken down to build the lighthouse with.\" A broad deep moat faced with stone seems to have been greatly relied on by the natives for the defence of the place from hostile attack. On the British taking possession of the fort in 1803, this was drained, and numerous alligators which infested it, either destroyed or allowed to escape into the river. Within the fort is an old mosque, built by the former Mogul occupants. It has no architectural pretensions whatever. The town is straggling, and exhibits evident signs of decay. There are some very good houses of hewn stone and brick, but for the most part in very indifferent repair, the poverty of the inhabitants preventing them from maintaining their habitations in decent condition. In the suburbs is the \"Kuddum Russool,\" a Mussulman building displaying neither grandeur nor elegance, but venerated from its containing some alleged sacred relics. The inclosure and the ground surrounding it are used as the common burial-place for the Moslem inhabitants; and the guardian priests make a good harvest in unhealthy seasons, by the mortuary-fees exacted for each grave. The Jama Masjit, or great mosque, in the main street, is a very clumsy, inelegant building: it is used both as a school and a place of devotion. The Brahminical temples are rude, ungraceful erections, and generally small. The only one of large dimensions, and which was commenced by a Mahratta governor, is unfinished. Very little trade now exists in Cuttack. It has manufactures of brass cooking-vessels, and shoes, which constitute the staple commodities of the place. The soil of the vicinity is poor and sandy: rice of indifferent quality is the principal crop.\n\nThe population is estimated at 40,000.

In a commercial point of view, its situation* is advantageous, commanding an easy communication by the course of the Bhagruttee and Ganges with the North-West Provinces, and also with Calcutta by the course of the Bhagruttee and Hoogly.

His stockings were of woollen stuff sewed, and ought rather from their shape, or want of shape, to have been called bags. His shoes were exactly Chinese, the soles having a spherical shape. He wore also a Chinese skull-cap, but the other people in the village went bareheaded, and wore long tails plaited. They were all rather fair, particularly the women, who had a fine rosy colour. We were very much pleased with the appearance of the assembled village, and could hardly help thinking we had got on the high road to Pekin.\" Notwithstanding that the elevation of Dabling is 9,400 feet above the sea, the reverberation of the sun's rays from the rocks rising about it, caused, during the visit of Gerard, the heat to be so great, that the thermometer reached 109\u00b0 in a tent. A mile to the east of Dabling, is another less village, called Doobling, the path between them being very rough, and rendered practicable by means of scaffolds or balconies fastened in some places against perpendicular faces of precipices. The vicinity is fertile, in comparison with the sterility of the mountains rising on every side, and produces walnuts, apricots (which, when dried, resemble prunes, and form an important article in the diet of the inhabitants), cherries of small size but fine flavour, deodars, and birches. Those villages are considered so connected, that they are always named together, under the appellation of Dabling-Doobling.

Lat. 28\u00b0 21', long. 78\u00b0 23'.\n\nDACCA.\u2014A British district, named from its principal place, and situate within the limits of the presidency of Bengal. It is bounded on the north by the British district Mymensing; on the east by the British districts Tipperah and Bullooh; on the south by the British district Backergunge; and on the west by the British district Deccan Jelalpore, or Furreedpore. It lies between lat. 23\u00b0 12'\u201424\u00b0 17', long. 90\u00b0 11'\u201490\u00b0 58', and has an area of 1,960 square miles. It is a level depressed tract, drained by numerous rivers, and by streams of inferior dimensions. In the north-western part of the district, however, and also in its eastern angle towards the Megna, are some small ridges, generally running from north to south, and having an elevation from twenty to fifty feet above the adjacent country. The southern division of the district is the most depressed, and being, in consequence, widely inundated during the periodical rains of closing summer and commencing autumn, is generally under rice-cultivation. Of the rivers, the Megna, or lower Brahmapootra, flowing from north-west to south-east, first touches on the district at its northern boundary at Agarasonda, and continuing to hold a direction southeast for thirty miles, forms the eastern boundary as far as Byrub Bazar, where it turns to the south, and flowing in that direction forty-five miles, forms the boundary on the east side of Dacca, towards Tipperah and Bullooh, as far as Moiskondi, where it leaves the district. At the point where it turns south, it receives on the left the Gora Outra, a considerable stream, and is thence termed the Megna; fifty miles lower down, it, on the right side, receives the Dulasseree, a large offset of the Koonae or Jabuna, and twenty-five miles lower down, on the same side, the Kirty-Nassa, a large offset from the Ganges. It also sends off and receives, right and left, many other watercourses of less importance, and several small tributaries from the Tipperah hills.\n\nThe year may be considered to be divided into three seasons\u2014the hot, the rainy, and the cool. The first lasts from the beginning of March to the end of June, and is succeeded by the periodical rains, continuing until the early\nDACCA.\n\npart of October, at the close of which the cool season commences, and lasts till the middle of February, when the weather gradually becomes warmer. During the cool season, ice may be obtained by exposing water to the night air in shallow, wide earthen vessels. Generally the climate is characterized by moisture, resulting as well from the great amount of rain, as from evaporation from the several great rivers. During the hot season, sickness is prevalent, and increases with the temperature. During the cool season, there are, with little intermission, either fogs or heavy dews. The mean annual temperature at noon is 79\u00b0; the greatest annual fall of rain has been found to be ninety-three inches, the least forty-six, the mean seventy.\n\nIn the northern and western parts of the district there is much kunkur, or calcareous tufa, in many places largely impregnated with iron. There is also much clay, white, yellow, or blue, which on the more elevated parts is barren, and overrun with jungle; but in the depressed tracts, flooded during the periodical rains, is overlaid with a deep dark-coloured alluvial mould of great fertility. Altogether, however, the average fertility of this district is decidedly inferior to that of the country north and west of it.\n\nOf wild animals, Dacca possesses the elephant, buffalo, tiger, bear, and leopard. Of wild birds, there are the fishing-eagle, vulture, kite, argila or adjutant-bird, and cranes of various kinds. The porpoise is common in the large rivers, which also harbour in great numbers the ghariyal, or sharp-beaked crocodile, and the magar, or blunt-beaked crocodile (alligator). Snakes exist in great number and variety. Fish are abundant and excellent. The domestic animals are principally kine and buffaloes.\n\nCultivation is partial and unskilful, so that the district does not supply its own consumption of grain, and that article is imported in large quantities from the neighbouring districts. Esculent vegetables are abundant, but usually not of kinds known in Europe. Sugar, betel-nut, hemp, indigo, and other plants yielding dye-stuffs, are produced in moderate quantities. Cotton was formerly produced in considerable quantities, but its culture has been much limited since the manufacture of fine muslins in the city of Dacca has ceased, the staple being too short for the manufacture of coarse strong fabrics, which\nDACCA.\n\nalone are now made in the district. In the attempts recently made by the East-India Company to introduce the American cotton, Dacca participated; but the result was complete and total failure. The climate appears to be unsuitable for the purpose, and myriads of insects preying on the plants, destroyed the bolls and frustrated the hopes of the cultivators.\n\nManufacturing industry is circumscribed and insignificant, since the failure of the muslin-trade. Dyeing, bleaching, embroidering, working in gold and silver, the fabrication of articles of jewellery, glass, paper, soap, cabinet-ware, coarse woollens, sacking, cordage, and hardware, are carried on to a small extent. The exports are coarse cottons and woollens, indigo, date-sugar, preserved fruits, betelnut, dried fish, cheese, soap, jewellery, and hardware; the imports, grain, oil-seeds, spices, cocoanuts, tobacco, catechu, wax, silk, British cotton yarn and piece-goods, metals, hardware, timber, bamboos, and lime.\n\nThe amount of population is returned officially at 600,000, which, compared with the area, indicates a relative density of 306 to the square mile. In the northern part of the district, are two tribes, denominated, the one Kunch, the other Rajbansi, apparently of different origin from the rest of the population; more robust in physical type, and more daring and resolute in character. Excluding these, the Mussulmans are considered to be more numerous than the Brahminists, but not in a great degree. Education does not appear to be greatly encouraged in Dacca. The town has a government college in a prosperous state (of which some account will be found in the proper place), but throughout the district there were on the 30th September, 1850, only two government vernacular schools.\n\nDacca, the locality of the civil establishment and a military cantonment, Narainganj, and Islampoor, are described under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThere are scarcely any roads in this district, in consequence of the facility afforded by the several large rivers for communication by water, and the extreme difficulty of conducting roads across the numerous streams. There is a very indifferent route from south-west to north-east through Dacca, from Calcutta to Sylhet; another from south to north, from Dacca\nto Nusserabad, in the adjoining district of Mymensing. A superior road, projected some years since, from the capital, was abandoned in consequence of the great difficulty in the way of its execution. At a recent period, a line of steam communication was established experimentally, between Calcutta and Dacca, but the result was unfavourable, the expense having greatly exceeded the receipts. The failure, however, being attributed in some degree to the slowness with which the natives of Bengal adopt new customs, it was resolved to continue the experiment, and to extend the line to Assam.\n\nUnder the Mahomedan rule, the affairs of Dacca were administered by an officer appointed by the nawaub of Bengal, and accountable to him for the revenues of the province. The establishment of the British authority, on the grant of the Dewanny in 1765, of course put an end to the actual power of the subordinate governor, as well as to that of the chief; but an adequate provision was made for the Dacca nawaub, and his successors continued stipendiaries of the British government until the year 1845, when the title and dignity became extinct by the death of the last possessor without heirs. The pecuniary allowances thereupon lapsed, but a small sum was allotted for the maintenance of the female connections and servants of the deceased nawaub.\n\nDACCA, a town, the principal place of the British district of the same name, presidency of Bengal, is situate on the Burha Gunga, a considerable stream, communicating with the Dulasseree, a large offset of the Koonae or Jabuna. The Burha Gunga is, however, here about half a mile wide in the dry season, and still wider during the rainy season. The climate is considered good, the heat being tempered by the cooling effect of the numerous rivers; and as their currents are rather rapid, they produce none of the deleterious results of stagnant water, or of water approaching to stagnancy. The city is four miles in length, and one and a quarter in breadth. It is at present a wide expanse of ruins, in many places overgrown with jungle, which, as well as the dilapidated buildings, is infested with numerous tigers, snakes, and other noxious creatures. \"All its splendid buildings, the castle of\n\n* Walter states that \"this city can now boast an iron suspension-bridge,\" which is kept in thorough repair.\nits founder, Shah Jehangir, the noble mosque he built, the palaces of the ancient newaubs, the factories and churches of the Dutch, French, and Portuguese nations, are all sunk into ruin, and overgrown with jungle.\" Though thus comparatively desolate, its minarets, huge ruined palaces, and other monuments of departed grandeur, give it an impressive and not unpleasing aspect, during the periodical rains of closing summer and autumn, when it stands alone above a wide, watery waste. At present, the works and places of public character are fitting only to be enumerated, not described.\n\nThe city and suburbs are, in a recent publication, stated to possess ten bridges, thirteen ghats or landing-places, seven ferry-stations, twelve bazars, three public wells, a variety of buildings for fiscal and judicial purposes, a jail and jail-hospital, a lunatic asylum, and a native hospital. Among the noticeable establishments is the elephant depot, containing generally from two to three hundred of these animals. The religious edifices devoted to Christianity are St. Thomas's Church, the Baptist Mission meeting-house, the Romish, Armenian, and Greek churches. There are said to be a hundred and eighty Mussulman mosques, and a hundred and nineteen Brahminical temples. The English, Armenians, and Greeks, have cemeteries at this place. Here is a college subject to the control of the Council of Education, but under the management of a local committee, consisting of twelve members, of whom one half are unconnected with government, and five are natives. The committee have a secretary, and for conducting the educational duties, there are, besides a head master, superintending the whole establishment, three masters in the senior, and nine in the junior school department, of which latter six are natives. There is also a vernacular department, directed by two pundits; and attached are a librarian and a writer. In September, 1850, there were 340 pupils; of whom 46 were Christians, 15 Mahomedans, and 279 Hindoos. The daily average attendance was 293. The Baptist Mission maintain a number of schools here.\n\nIn 1850, the Court of Chancery pronounced its judgment in favour of the validity of the bequest contained in the will of the late Mr. Robert Mitford, for the benefit of the native inhabitants of Dacca, and the residue of the testator's estate,\namounting to between eleven and twelve thousand pounds, has been accordingly paid over to the government of Bengal, to be applied to charitable purposes within the city.\n\nThe manufactures of Dacca are at this time scarcely deserving of notice. A small quantity of coarse cotton, silk, and embroidered goods, constitutes the sum of them; and even this scanty remnant of skilled industry is constantly and rapidly giving way before the competition of British fabrics. The muslins of Dacca were formerly unrivalled for fineness and every desirable quality. The spinning of the very fine thread was carried on with wonderful nicety. The operation was performed with a fine steel spindle by young women, who could only work during the early part of the morning, while the dew was on the ground; for such was the extreme tenacity of the fibre, that it would not bear manipulation after the sun had risen. The darners were so skilful, that they could remove an entire thread from a piece of muslin, and replace it by one of finer texture. The demand for those extremely beautiful fabrics was principally for the supply of the royal wardrobe at Delhi, and has declined with the decay of that court. Such muslin, from its wonderful fineness, was called abrawan, or \"flowing water,\" and shabnam, \"evening dew.\" The manufacture is now totally lost; and though some time ago an order was sent from China for a small quantity of such muslin, at the rate of ten rupees, or 1l. per square yard, no artisan could be found competent to execute it. The falling off of the general Dacca trade took place as far back as 1801, previously to which the yearly advances made by the East-India Company and private traders for Dacca muslins, were estimated at upwards of twenty-five lacs of rupees (250,000l.). In 1807, the Company's investments had fallen to 59,590l., and the private trade to about 56,020l. In 1813, the private trade did not exceed 20,595l., and that of the Company was scarcely more considerable.\n\nIn 1817, the English commercial residency was altogether discontinued. The French and Dutch factories had been abandoned many years before. The extent of misery caused by the annihilation of the manufacture and trade of this once flourishing mart, is not readily to be conceived.\n\nThe population, according to a census made in 1830,\namounted (exclusive of military) to 66,989; of which number 31,429 were Brahminists, 35,238 Mussulmans, 322 Armenians, Greeks, and others; the whole residing in 16,279 houses. This result shows a great diminution since 1814, when the number of houses assessed to the police-rate was 21,631. Within the last eight or ten years, however, there is reason to think that the prosperity and population of the place have somewhat increased. The importance of Dacca is of comparatively recent date, as it is not mentioned either by Ferishta or Abulfazl.\n\nThe civil establishment of the district of which this is the chief location, consists of a judge, a collector, and other European officers, with a due proportion of subordinates. For military purposes, Dacca is within the Presidency division, and the immediate vicinity of the town was usually the station of a regiment of infantry and a detail of artillery. It had, however, been alleged, that the site of the cantonment was unhealthy, and in consequence remedial measures were from time to time adopted. These, however, failed in producing the desired result, and at the latter end of 1852, it was finally determined to abandon the cantonment.

Here is a large bazar, and supplies and water are plentiful. The road to the north, or towards Hansee, is sandy and heavy, but good southwards. According to De Cruz, the district of Dadree, which was originally conferred upon the nawaub of Bahadoorgurh for the support of troops, was retained by the Jujhur nawaub, who furnished the quota for whose maintenance the district had been granted; but it appears from more recent information, that the chief of Jujhur has restored the estate to the former grantee.

There are two large antique shiwalas, or Hindoo temples, on the bank of the Ganges, and an ancient flight of brick-built steps gives access to the river, for the purpose of the ritual ablutions of pilgrims, it being recognised as a holy place. There is besides a brick-built fort, with walls. Butter states, its \"population to be 10,000, of whom 250 are Mussulmans.\" It is mentioned in the Ayeen Akberry as situate in the sircar or subdivision of Manickpoor, in the province or soubah of Allahabad, and as having a brick fort, and being assessed at 90,651 rupees.

Lat. 26\u00b0 27', long. 90\u00b0 56'.\n\nDAMAN.*\u2014A town on the coast of the Northern Concan, and belonging to the Portuguese, though included within the limits of the presidency of Bombay. It is situate on the Damungunga, or river of Daman, which rises in the Ghaute, about forty miles further east. The river has a bar at its mouth, having two feet water at low water spring tides, and eighteen or twenty feet inside. There is never less in common springs than three fathoms at high water on the bar, the rise of the tide being seventeen or eighteen feet. Outside the bar is a road, in which vessels may anchor in eight fathoms of water. The town is fortified, and has a rampart with ten bastions and two gateways. There are nine Christian churches, and a fort called the Castle of St. Hieronymus. The surrounding country is fruitful and pleasant, except in the rainy season, when it is extensively overflowed. During the dry season, there remain some shallow jhils or ponds, abounding in fish and reptiles. The river, admitting the tide, is brackish, and when the water left by rain is evaporated, recourse is had to wells, the water of which, however, is also in some degree brackish, and moreover, very unwholesome, causing fevers and other formidable ailments. \"Provisions\" and vegetables are\n\n* Daman of Tassin; Damman of the Oordoo writers.\nDAM.\n\ncheap and plentiful.\" Daman is an excellent place for small vessels to remain at during the S.W. monsoon, and for the purpose of repair, the country being well stocked with ship-timber. Many ships of from 500 to 600 tons burden have been built in this river. Daman, described as \"a town great and strong,\" was sacked and burned by the Portuguese in 1531. It was subsequently rebuilt, and in 1558 was taken by the Portuguese, who converted the mosque into a Christian church. The place appears from that time to have remained one of their possessions. The district, of which the town is the principal place, is about ten miles in length from north to south, and five in breadth. Distance of the town of Daman from Bombay, N., 101 miles. Lat. 20\u00b0 24', long. 72\u00b0 53'.\n\nDAMAN, or THE BORDER, so called because it stretches between the Suliman Mountains and the Indus. The tract formerly constituted a portion of Runjeet Singh's kingdom of Lahore, and is now annexed to the British province of the Punjab. Where not under the influence of irrigation, it in general presents the appearance of a plain of smooth hard clay, bare of grass, but sprinkled with dwarfish bushes, tamarisks, and occasionally trees of larger size, but seldom exceeding the height of twenty feet, the soil or climate being unfavourable to their further growth. In place of the clay, the surface in some places consists of a loose and irreclaimable sand. The clay appears to be deposited by the waters either of the Indus or of the numerous small rivers which, during the season of the melting of the snow, stream down from the mountains, and add to the inundation. Where duly irrigated, the clay is very productive, and few countries are more fertile than the Derajat, or that part of the plain which extends along the western bank of the Indus. The Derajat, so called from the three towns, Dera Ismael Khan, Dera Fati Khan, and Dera Ghazee Khan, abounds in towns and good villages. In summer, the heat in the Daman is intense, and the productions in a great measure resemble those of India.\n\nThe Daman is 800 miles long, from the Kala or Salt Range on the north, to the confines of Sinde on the south, and has an average breadth of about sixty miles. Lat. 28\u00b0 40' to 33\u00b0 20', long. 69\u00b0 30' to 71\u00b0 20'.\n\nDAMDAMA.\u2014A town in the Rajpoot state of Kotah, 73 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.\nDAMMOODAH.\n\nmiles N.E. from Neemuch, and 11 miles S. from Kotah. Lat. 25\u00b0, long. 75\u00b0 56'.\n\nDAMMOODAH,1*\u2014A river rising in the British district of Ramgurh, presidency of Bengal, about lat. 23\u00b0 55', long. 84\u00b0 53'. It takes a south-easterly direction through the British districts Ramgurh and Pacheet, into those of Bancoora and Burdwan, and twelve miles below the principal town of the last-named district, and in lat. 23\u00b0 5', long. 88\u00b0 1', it turns nearly due south, a direction which it holds for the remainder of its course through the British districts Burdwan and Hoogly, until its fall into the river Hoogly on the right side, in lat. 22\u00b0 13', long. 88\u00b0 7'; its total length of course being 350 miles. Its feeders are numerous, the most important being the Barrachur, a considerable torrent, falling into it on the left side, in lat. 23\u00b0 40', long. 86\u00b0 51'. On the route from Calcutta to Hazareebagh, it is crossed by means of a ferry,2 fifty miles above its mouth. At Raneegunj, eighty-five miles higher up, and in lat. 23\u00b0 35', long. 87\u00b0 8', the bed of the stream is described by Jacquemont3 as 500 yards wide, fordable, with a rapid current, and limpid water, about one foot deep in the middle of December, or during the dry season. At Gomeah, ninety miles higher up the stream, the same traveller states4 the bed to be 250 yards wide, and free from obstructions, with a slender stream of very fine water.\u2020 The valley of the Dammoodah, which is about to be traversed by the railway from Calcutta, is known to abound in coal and iron; and, indeed, the only doubt as to the practicability of manufacturing malleable iron in the district, arises from the absence of limestone for the reduction of the ore into metal. Limestone, however, may be imported from Sylhet and other places; and it has been estimated by competent authority,5 that, assuming the cost of railway bars at 10l. per ton, bar-iron may be manufactured in the Dam-\n\n* Dummodah of Rennell. Wilford observes,1 \"Damodara, one of the sacred names of Vishnu;\" and adds, \"in spoken dialects, it is called Damoda or Damadi.\"\n\n\u2020 Hamilton, speaking of this river, states1 that \"it is important, as greatly assisting the inland navigation of the adjacent districts;\" and, in a recent publication2 of high character, it is stated to be navigable, during the rainy season, from the Hoogly as far as the confluence of the Barrachur, a distance of 170 miles, for vessels of twenty tons.\nmoodah valley at least twenty per cent. lower than it could be imported from England.\n\n**DAMUK.**\u2014A town in one of the recently sequestrated districts of the native state of Hyderabad, or dominions of the Nizam, 25 miles S.E. from Omraouttee, and 85 miles S.W. from Nagpoor.

Here is a spacious well-built serae, or public lodging-house, surrounded by a rampart of brick, with battlements and loopholes, and probably intended for a stronghold of the former government. There is another extensive serae, inclosed and secured by gates. The number of houses, including Ahmudgunj, has been computed at about 2,000;\u2020 and, admitting the usual ratio of inmates to houses, the population appears to be about 10,000. It is a place of considerable trade, and has manufactures of stringis, or coarse cotton carpets, blankets, and cotton fabrics of various sorts. The police division, of which it is the principal place, contains 378 villages, and a population computed at 92,300; the Brahminists being as ten to six to the Mussulmans.

Lat. 10\u00b0 45', long. 77\u00b0 36'.\n\n* Buchanan, after mentioning the fort, gives the following curious statement:\u2014\"The commandant, according to the report of the natives, agreed to surrender the place to Col. Fullarton. As, however, he wished to make an appearance of resistance, some pioneers were sent into the ditch to undermine the wall, which they did very coolly, while over their heads the garrison kept up a tremendous fire. When the passage was open, the firing ceased, and our troops walked in quietly, without any injury being done on either side.\"\nDARBARBA, in the Punjaub, a large fortress of the Daman. It is situate 12 miles N.W. of Tak, and at the mouth of a pass into the Suliman Mountains. Its walls are very lofty, but it does not appear to be otherwise of importance, and it is situate in a very barren and secluded country. Lat. 32\u00b0 15', long. 70\u00b0 20'.\n\nDARBEE.\u2014A town of North-Eastern India, in the native state of Bhotan, 60 miles E. from Darjeeling, and 105 miles N. from Rungpore.

It rises in about lat. 31\u00b0 57', long. 78\u00b0 25', on the south-western declivity of the stupendous range of Damuk Shu, bounding that territory on the side of Ladakh. Gerard estimates the elevation of its source at about 15,000 feet above the sea. The scene, as described by him, is one of terrific desolation. \"The Darboong was lost amidst the fields of snow and ice by which it was generated; the whole space on every side was floored by ice, half-hid under stones and rubbish. In some places the snow is of an incredible thickness, and lies in heaps. Having accumulated for years together, it separates by its gravity, and spreads wide desolation in its route. Nowhere in my travels have I observed such enormous bodies of snow and ice, or altogether such a scene.\"\u00b2 About five miles below this place, and nearly south of it, the stream receives a number of snow-torrents, tumbling down the glaciers and mountains on every side, and rushes downwards, sometimes amidst spiry peaks of limestone, sometimes beneath vast arches of perpetual ice and snow. Soomdo, about two miles below this, or between six and seven miles from the source, has an elevation of 13,000 feet, so that the torrent in that part of its course has a fall of nearly 300 feet a mile. The declivity, however, soon becomes much less, and the stream flows through a fertile dell,\u00b3 to which it affords the means of irrigation indispensable to productiveness in this arid climate. It is in consequence bordered by several villages, by the name of one of which it is sometimes called the Rooshkatong. Jacquemont\u2074 describes it, in this part of its course, as a considerable river, which descends from the north-west with turbulence and enormous rapidity. At Soongnum, it is crossed by a sanga or wooden bridge, thirty-three feet long,\u2075 and at an elevation of 9,030 feet above the sea; and\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms. Doc. As.

It is situate \"on\\(^2\\) the southern side of a great \nhollow or basin, being that of the Runjeet River, which falls \ninto the Teesta a few miles east of the place. To the north, \nthe view is open, and exhibits the usual succession of range \nbeyond range, all irregularly ramifying in every direction, and \nin apparently inextricable confusion: it terminates in the \nSnowy Range. To the westward, the view is confined by a lofty \nrange at the distance of about ten miles; to the eastward, \nappears the valley of the Teesta; and on each side of it is the \nconfused assemblage of mountain-ridges, as to the north; to \nthe south, Darjeeling has the Sinchul Peak, elevated about \n9,000 feet, and Gurdun-Kuttur range, which is a ramification \nof it. These mountains are completely clothed with forest \nfrom the top to the very bottom.\"\n\nIn regard to natural scenery, the country round Darjeeling \nis described as inferior to that of Landour and Mussooree, \nbut as contrasting favourably with that of Almora. In one \nrespect, however, it has an advantage even over the former \nplaces, commanding as it does the most magnificent view \nwhich can probably be obtained of the Snowy Range, distant \nabout sixty miles, in which, eminently conspicuous, appears the \nKunching Jinga, rising 27,000 feet above the sea. Dr. \nHooker,\\(^3\\) when on a botanical mission to this region, thus \ndescribes his first impression of the scene:\u2014\"Early next morn-\ning I caught my first view, and I literally held my breath in \nawe and admiration.

Owing to the clearness of the atmosphere, the snow appeared to my fancy but a few miles off, and the loftiest mountain at only a day's journey. The heavenward outline was projected against a pale-blue sky, while little detached patches of mist clung here and there to the highest peaks, and were tinged golden-yellow or rosy-red by the rising sun.\"\n\nGneiss is the principal formation of the rock at Darjeeling; slate occurs on the banks of the Runjeet River; at the foot of the hills, iron-ore abounds; and traces of copper are said to have been discovered.\n\nThe advantages possessed by Darjeeling, as the site for a sanatorium, in the salubrity of its climate* and facility of access from the plains of Bengal, induced the British government, in 1835, to open a negotiation with the rajah of Sikkim, for its cession, in return for an equivalent in land or money. The rajah consented to an unconditional and gratuitous transfer. Several years afterwards, however, a grant of 3,000 rupees per annum was made to the rajah, as compensation for the cession, which sum at a later period was doubled. A sanatorium for Europeans has been established, and its results, as exhibited in official medical reports, are considered satisfactory. The district of which Darjeeling is the principal place, was enlarged in 1850, by the annexation of a further portion of the territory of Sikkim. The sequestration of this tract, yielding a revenue of 26,037 rupees, took place in consequence of outrages committed by the rajah against British subjects, a course of conduct which at the same time exposed him to the forfeiture of the annual payment which had been granted as compensation for Darjeeling.

Lat. 27\u00b0 17', long. 82\u00b0 58'.\n\nDECCAN,\u00b9 in its usual acceptation, implies the tract of country in Southern India, situate between the Nerbudda and the Kistna rivers. Properly speaking, however, it includes the whole of the territory lying south of the Vindhya Mountains, which separate it from Hindostan on the north. Taken in its latter extent, it comprehends the valley of the Nerbudda, and the narrow tract of lowland forming a belt round the coast of the Peninsula; and it occupies, in addition thereto, the vast expanse of triangular table-land, which, resting on each side upon the Eastern and Western Ghauts, is supported at its base by the sub-Vindhyan range, termed the Sautpoora Mountains.\n\nThe seaward face of the table-land on the west, towards the Concans, though abrupt,\u00b2 is not precipitous, but consists of a succession of terraces or steps. In their northern section, the Ghauts, on this side of the Peninsula, attain an elevation seldom exceeding 3,000 feet; advancing southward, the range increases in height, Bonasson Hill being 7,000 feet above the level of the sea, and the peak of Dodapet, in the Neilgherries, having an elevation of 8,700. Near Cape Comorin, in the extreme south, and at the point of convergence with the range from the opposite coast, the Western Ghauts terminate abruptly in a peak about 2,000\u00b3 feet above the sea. Their average elevation may be stated at about 4,000 feet. From the point of convergence, the Eastern Ghauts take a northerly direction. These last-mentioned mountains, at their southern extremity, may be characterized rather as detached groups and clusters of hills appearing at intervals, than as a regular range. About lat. 11\u00b0 40', they assume the character of a continuous chain, and, running along the coast of Coromandel in a direction a little north-west of the city of Madras, form a junction at Naggery, in lat. 13\u00b0 20', with the main ridge, which crosses the Peninsula in a south-west direction,\u2074 to the Neilgherries. Thence the Eastern Ghauts continue a northerly course, and terminate in about the same latitude as their counterpart of the opposite coast. Here uniting with the Vindhya zone, which crosses the continent from east to west, they constitute one side of the triangle upon which rests the table-land of the\n\n\u00b9 Mil.

Soc. viii. 139\u2014Newbold, Geol. of Southern India. As. Res. xviii. 5.\n\u2074 Newbold, ut supra, 139.\nDeccan. In regularity and grandeur, the Eastern Ghauts bear no comparison with those of Western India; their average elevation does not exceed 1,500 feet. The intermediate table-land has consequently a gradual slope to the eastward, as indicated by the drainage of the country in that direction. All the principal rivers,\u2014the Godavery, Cauvery, Kistna, and Pennaur, though deriving their sources from the base of the Western Ghauts, find their way into the Bay of Bengal through fissures in the Eastern Ghauts. According to Captain Newbold, \"the mean elevation of the table-land around Bangalore and Nundidroog above the sea is 3,000 feet; northerly, towards Hyderabad, it sinks to 1,800 feet; and a little south of Bangalore, it falls, by rather abrupt steps, to the level of the plains of Salem, viz. 1,400 feet; whence to Cape Comorin the mean height of the country is about 400 feet. The average height of the low country between the Ghauts and the sea, on both the coasts of Coromandel and Malabar, may be roughly estimated at 200 feet, rising at the base of the mountains to 800 feet.\" On the Coromandel side, the slope to the sea is gentle, exhibiting the alluvial deposits borne down from the higher portions of the table-land; while that of Malabar is marked by a succession of irregular hilly spurs from the Ghauts, descending to the sea in abrupt cliffs. The central part of the Deccan is composed of waving downs, which, at one time, present for hundreds of miles one unbroken sheet of green harvests; but, in the hot season, bear the appearance of a desert, naked and brown, without a tree or shrub to relieve its gloomy sameness.\n\nA general outline of the geology of the Deccan is all that the limits of this article will permit to be sketched. A writer, already quoted, observes, \"Hypogene schists, penetrated and broken up by prodigious outbursts of plutonic and trappean rocks, occupy by far the greater portion of the superficies of Southern India. They constitute the great bulk of the Western Ghauts, from between the latitudes of 16\u00b0 and 17\u00b0 to Cape Comorin, and from the base of the Eastern Ghauts, from beyond the north limit of the Peninsula, to their deflection at Naggery, in lat. 13\u00b0 20'. They are partially capped and fringed in the Western Ghauts by laterite, and in the Eastern Ghauts by sandstone, limestone, and laterite. From Naggery\nDECCAN.\n\nto Cape Comorin, they form, with few exceptions, the basis of the plains of the Carnatic, Arcot, the valley of Seringapatam, Salem, Trichinopoly, Coimbatore, Tanjore, Madras, Tinnevelly, and Travancore; and, intimately associated with granite, the principal hills and ranges on the low lands south of the Salem Break and valley of the Cauvery. North of this valley, and above the break, they form the basis of the table-lands of Mysore, the Baramahal, Bellary district, part of Hyderabad, and the Southern Mahratta country; and present a groundwork on which will be sketched out, as accurately as the present imperfect state of information will permit, the circumscribed areas occupied by more recent aqueous strata. Towards the north-west flank of our area, almost in a line drawn diagonally across the Peninsula from Nagpore, by Beejapore, to the western coast, the hypogene and plutonic rocks disappear, emerging only occasionally under one of the largest continuous sheets of trap in the world.\" Compared, then, with some other countries, the geology of Southern India is clear and distinct in its principal features. It has been ascertained, partly from observation, and partly by means of specimens obtained from various sections of the country, that the entire basis of the Peninsula, and its principal elevations,* are composed wholly of granite. Overlying the granitic floor, are the stratified hypogene rocks, the usual order of superposition being gneiss resting immediately on the granite, followed by mica and hornblende schists, the two latter supporting clay-slate, statuary marble, &c. These rocks are wholly destitute of organic remains; for, although of aqueous origin, as attested by their stratified character, the sedimentary deposit has subsequently become crystallized by the effect of subterranean heat, and hence they are grouped by geologists in the metamorphic class. Ascending in the series, we next arrive at the fossiliferous strata. Here, in the order of superposition, limestone is the lowest, followed by varieties of clay and sand rocks. From various circumstances, arising chiefly from the paucity of the imbedded fossils, and from the failure of discovering among them the distinguishing genera, these varieties have not hitherto admitted of a detailed classification. These\n\n* Severndroog, Chitteldroog, and others in Mysore; Adoni and others in the Ceded Districts, &c. &c.\nsedimentary rocks are overlaid by the trap formation, a volcanic product, fused by subterranean heat, and projected to the earth's surface, where it occasionally assumes a columnar form, but more usually may be traced in extensive sheets, covering a vast tract of country. Two rocks, of aqueous origin, peculiar to Southern India, are met with, capping trap and all other rocks, without reference to age or composition. These are laterite and regur. The former consists of an iron-clay. In its texture, it is full of cavities and pores, and contains a large quantity of iron. While in the mass, and excluded from the air, it is soft and readily cut; but upon being broken up and exposed, it soon becomes hard, and resists the effects of air and water better than brick. It is consequently one of the most valuable materials for building. The maximum thickness of its beds does not exceed 200 feet, and these are not altogether destitute of organic remains. Regur is the black cotton clay, formerly supposed to be produced by the decomposition of trap rocks, but now regarded, and apparently more justly, as a marine deposit. One other overlying formation requires notice,\u2014the calcareous substance termed kunkur, found on analysis to contain the elements of oolite and chalk. Its origin is referred to the action of thermal springs, charged with carbonic acid, bringing up lime in solution, and depositing it on the earth's surface. It is used as a rough building-stone, and universally employed to burn into lime.\n\nThe universal prevalence of granite and the hypogene rocks has been mentioned. It remains to describe the geographical position of the more recent and the overlying strata. Partial deposits of sand-rock, of a recent period, containing pelagic shells, are found scattered over the south-eastern extremity of the Peninsula; but the older sandstone and limestone beds are not met with south of Salem. The chief development of these older rocks lies in the district of Cuddapah, and again in Hyderabad, also in the Southern Mahratta country, and in the tract between the Godavery and the Kistna. A bed of shelly limestone occurs in the vicinity of Pondicherry, to which, from an examination of its fossils, geologists concur in assigning a more elevated position than to the limestone strata before described. The outpouring of the trap rock is distributed over a considerable portion of the Peninsula. It extends from the\nDECCAN.\n\nseashore, at the northern extremity of the Western Ghauts, to its eastern limit at Nagpore and the banks of the river Toombuddra, and terminates southward on the seacoast, in the latitude of Fort Victoria or Bancot. Within these boundaries the landscape is marked by the usual distinctive features of basaltic rock; hills of tabular form rising from the general level, sometimes abruptly, in perpendicular masses; sometimes in steps, or terraces, piled one upon another, decked with magnificent forests, and producing beautiful and romantic scenery. From the southern termination of the trap, the laterite or iron-clay succeeds as the overlying rock, to Cape Comorin, covering the base of the mountains and the narrow tract that separates them from the sea, and occasionally exhibiting a succession of low rounded hills and undulations. It exists also in detached beds on the opposite coast of the Peninsula, expanding over a large surface near the south banks of the Pennar,* crowning the loftiest summits of the Ghauts, and of the table-lands in the interior. Regur, like laterite, overtops all other rocks, with the single exception of the most recent deposits. This soil is chiefly indebted for its fertility to its retentive power in regard to moisture. When its surface is dried to an impalpable powder, the substratum retains its character of a hard black clay approaching to rock, usually moist and cold. \"It occupies principally the elevated table-lands of the Ceded Districts, the Hyderabad, Nagpore, and Southern Mahratta countries. It is less common in Mysore, but is again seen in continuous sheets, from six to twenty feet thick, below the Salem Break, covering the lower plain of Coimbatore, Madura, Salem, Trichinopoly, Tanjore, Ramnad, and Tinnevelly, to the vicinity of Cape Comorin.\"\n\nOf the remote history of the Deccan little is known. Hindoo legend relates that it was invaded by Rama, king of Oude, when in pursuit of Ravan, the ruler of Ceylon, who had carried off his consort Siva; but the date of Rama's existence is involved in obscurity. An ancient distribution of the country into the national divisions of Dravira or the Tamul Country, Carnata, Telingana, Maharashta, and Orissa, is, however, indicated by the five corresponding languages\u00b9 of the Deccan, all of which are derived from an origin totally distinct from the Sanscrit.\n\n* Calder, in As. Res. xviii. 9.\n\n\u00b9 Elphinstone, Hist. of India, 306.\n\n\u00b2 Id. ut supra, 217.\nDECCAN.\n\nIn the fifth century before Christ, the Peninsula is stated to have been partitioned between the four kingdoms of Pandya, Kerala, Cola, and Chola. Passing, however, to authentic history, we learn that the first Mahometan invasion of the Deccan was attempted in the year 1294, by Alaudin, afterwards emperor of Delhi. Its object was restricted to the assault of Deogiri, the capital of Maharashta; and this was successful, the city being captured and given up to pillage. A few years later, Alaudin extended his conquests over the whole of Maharashta, Telingana, and Carnata; and in 1325 the reduction of the Deccan was completed by Mohammed Togluk. But the supremacy of the emperor was not of long duration: the Hindoo rajahs of Telingana and Carnata were the first to recover their possessions. Their success was followed by the general revolt of the Deccan, in 1347, when Hasan Ganga founded the Mahomedan dynasty of Bahmani. His independence was recognised at Delhi, and the power of the empire was thus driven across the Nerbudda. In the struggles which ensued, the house of Bahmani succeeded in subverting the kingdom of Telengana, and, at a later period (1565), the fall of the monarchy of Bijayanagar or Carnata was effected, by the league of the Mussulman princes against Rajah Ram, at the battle of Talicote. Subsequent events tended to the dismemberment of the Bahmani empire; and its final dissolution gave rise to the independent Mahometan states of Beejapore, Ahmednuggur, Golconda, Bedur, and Berar. Of these the two latter, merging into one or other of the remainder, became extinct; and in the time of Shah Jehan, in 1680, the Deccan was divided into the three kingdoms of Ahmednuggur, Golconda, and Beejapore. The first of these became tributary to Shah Jehan in 1636; and in 1686, his son and successor Aurungzebe, subverting the monarchies of Golconda and Beejapore, the whole of the territory previously severed from the empire was recovered, and the Deccan once more passed under the rule of Delhi. But though Aurungzebe now grasped the universal sovereignty of India, he was not destined long to retain it. The Mahrattas, who had previously attracted little notice, had emerged from obscurity during the reign of his father, and were now about to act a conspicuous part in the history of the Deccan. In the late imperial contest with Golconda and Beejapore, they had shared the fate of the con-\n\nElphinstone, ut supra, 218.\nDECCAN.\n\nquered; but their power and resources, though crippled, were not destroyed. The fortresses and districts of which they had been dispossessed were again fast falling into their hands; and upon Aurungzebe's retreat to Ahmednuggur, in 1706, they attacked the imperial army, and plundered its baggage. Ten years after the death of Aurungzebe, his successor concluded a peace with Saho, the Mahratta chief, and admitted his claim to levy tribute over the whole of the Deccan. The Mogul empire was now tending to its close. Asof Jah, whose descendants are known as the nizams of Hyderabad, had succeeded to the viceroyalty of the Deccan. He was subsequently promoted to the office of vizier at Delhi; but being disgusted with the court, and sensible that his power rested upon a solid foundation, he resigned his appointment, and returned to his government at Hyderabad. The Mahrattas, in the interim, had obtained a large accession of territory, and at the time of Asof's return, the chief authority of the nation was wielded by Balaji, one of Saho's principal officers, and subsequently the founder of the dynasty of the Peishwas. This able minister had laboured unremittingly to concentrate the power of the Mahrattas; and having succeeded, he usurped the authority of his master, and offered himself as a competitor for the sovereignty of the Deccan. But Asof deemed the power of his rival too formidable for resistance: he therefore applied himself to accomplish its reduction by means of dissensions among the principal chiefs; but, failing in his attempt, he finally effected a compromise with the Peishwa, and entered the lists himself as an usurper. The result was the foundation, on the part of Asof, of the Mahometan kingdom of Hyderabad, which still continues to be ruled by his descendants; and the formation, under the Peishwa, of a powerful monarchy, comprising the larger portion of the territories now included within the limits of the presidency of Bombay. The remainder of the imperial possessions in the Peninsula, with few exceptions, were held by chieftains subject to the supremacy of one or the other of these two potentates. Those north of the Toombuddra were distributed principally between the rajahs of Colapore and Berar, and Angria of Colaba, all of whom acknowledged some degree of dependence upon the Peishwa. Of the provinces south of the Toombuddra, the Carnatic and Tanjore were held under the\nDECCAN.\n\nfeudal sovereignty of the Nizam. The Mysore, though previously tributary to both Moguls and Mahrattas, assumed independence during the commotions of the times, and in the sequel became the prize of the Mahometan usurper Hyder Ali. In the extreme south, the petty state of Travancore, secured from invasion by its remote position, and by the sea and mountains which surround it, appears to have long enjoyed an uninterrupted freedom from foreign sway. The nabob of Kurnoul, Rajah Tondiman, the rajah of Coorg, and other inferior rulers, seized each on his own district, and rose to the rank of petty princes, acknowledging a feudal superiority, but maintaining their own exclusive right to internal independence.\n\nSuch were the changes introduced into the native governments of the Deccan in the earlier part of the eighteenth century. The possessions of European nations within the Peninsula afforded at that time no indication of future grandeur. A few petty settlements acknowledged the dominion of France and Portugal. The English occupied a station at Surat, and another at Madras; and these, with the island of Bombay, constituted nearly the sum of British territory in Southern India. In the subsequent contests for power which ensued between the native chiefs, the English and French took opposite sides. The results of these struggles proved unfavourable to the powers whose cause had been espoused by the French. Among the men of that nation most distinguished in India, both in war and negotiation, was M. Bussy, who established the French power and influence over the Northern Circars, so often referred to in the Indian history of the middle of the eighteenth century. These possessions, however, like most of the French acquisitions, remained to them only a very short time. Clive attacked them with a force from Bengal, and though opposed by a larger force, the skill, energy, and happy fortune which marked all Clive\u2019s enterprises, triumphed, and the Circars were transferred from the French to their great rival in India. Thenceforward the interests of France rapidly declined, the influence of the British rose in the ascendant, and a new empire was established in India. Within the limits of the Deccan the French still retain Pondicherry, with other minor settlements, and the Portuguese continue undisturbed within the slender territory of Goa and Daman; but important revo-\nolutions have occurred in the native governments within the Peninsula, from which the British alone, of all the European settlers in India, reaped any advantage. The dismembered provinces of Mysore, at the close of the first war with Tippoo, formed the earliest addition to their original acquisitions. A further annexation accrued upon the death of Tippoo, and the final partition of his dominions. This was followed by the incorporation with the British empire, of the Carnatic and Tanjore. Some years later, the forfeited possessions of the Peishwa tended to swell the extent of the empire. These acquisitions, with certain cessions from the Nizam, the subsequent conquests of Kurnool and Coorg, and the lapse, from failure of heirs, of Angria's territory of Colaba, and the raj of Sattara, constitute in the aggregate a continuous territory, stretching from the banks of the Nerbudda to Cape Comorin. Its greatest length from north to south measures 1,000 miles, and its extreme breadth exceeds 800; and if Sinde and a portion of British Guzerat be excluded, the Deccan, as defined in this article, will be found to comprehend the provinces now distributed between the two presidencies of Madras and Bombay, with the several native states already enumerated.\n\nIt will be obvious that in so large a tract of country there must be a great diversity of people and great variations as to manners and character. In the countries connected with the British government of Bombay, the higher classes, everywhere in the East the most unmanageable, were in 1822 admitted by Mr. Elphinstone to certain privileges. A great dislike existed towards the courts of law, and the privileged classes, of which there were three constituted, were exempted, the first totally, the second partially, from the strict process of the Adawlut; while a third class, composed of meritorious native military officers of the rank of soubahdar, were exempted from personal arrest. A commission was appointed, which took cognizance of cases involving claims upon the first two classes, and proceeded to dispose of them in a mode which, while securing justice, should be free from offence. The commission was subsequently abolished, and its duties transferred to an officer called \"agent for sirdars.\"\n\nDECCAN SHABAZPORE.\u2014See BACKERGUNJE.\n\nDECKNALL.\u2014A town in one of the native states known\nas the Cuttack Mehals, 39 miles N. from Cuttack, and 77 miles S.W. from Balasore.

As it is nearly surrounded by water during a great part of the year, it is then almost inaccessible to an enemy. Before dismantled by the British, its outline, the outer wall, was an irregular pentagon, the southern and longest side of which towards the middle curves inwards, or towards the north. At the south-west angle is the Shah Bourj, a high rocky mount, having on its summit an area of fifty yards square, and inclosed by a rampart, having four commanding bastions facing the four cardinal points. Within the walls, the fort, an extensive building with high rampart twenty feet thick, furnished with bastions, commands the whole town. Close to the west of the fort is the palace of the rajah, with a fine garden, inclosed by a high wall. The ground-plan of the garden is rectangular, 475 feet long, and 350 wide; and on each side is a remarkably beautiful building. In the middle is an octagonal pond, with openings on four sides, leading up to the four buildings, each opening having, from the centre of the pond to the foot of the flight of steps\n\n* Dig, of Tassin.\nDEE.\n\nleading into them, an avenue of jets d'eau.\" These beautiful buildings, which are surpassed in India for elegance of design and perfection of workmanship only by the Taj Mahal of Agra, are constructed of a fine-grained sandstone, quarried of great dimensions at Roopbas, in the south-eastern part of the Bhurtpore territory. Deeg is a place of great antiquity. \"The ancient name was Diragh, or Dirghpura, and will be found mentioned in the Skand Puran, and 4th chapter of the Bhagavat Mahatama.\" It became early one of the chief strongholds of the Jats, from whom, in 1776, it was wrested by Nujuff Khan, the powerful minister of Shah Alum. After the death of Nujuff Khan, however, it reverted to the rajah of Bhurtpore. Here, on the 13th of November, 1804, the army of Holkar was defeated by a British force, under the command of General Fraser; and the Jats, having taken a hostile part by firing on the victors, siege was laid to the place on the 16th of December following, and on the 23rd of the same month it was carried by storm. Subsequently restored to the Jat rajah, it, after the capture of Bhurtpore by the British, commanded by Lord Combermere, was surrendered without resistance, and dismantled.

It lies between lat. $30^\\circ - 30^\\circ 32'$, long. $77^\\circ 43' - 78^\\circ 24'$.\n\nThe mountains on the north-eastern frontier of the valley, towards Gurwhal, have an elevation of 7,000 or 8,000 feet above the sea; those of the Sewalik range from 3,000 to 3,500. The elevation of the bed of the Ganges at the confluence of the river Sooswa, at the south-eastern extremity, is 1,200 feet; that of the Jumna, at the confluence of the Asun, at the north-western extremity, is 1,469. Midway between those depressed extremities of the valley, a gently increasing elevation runs transversely from the Sewalik mountains to those on the north-eastern boundary, and divides the valley into two basins, that on the north-west drained by the Asun, and that on the south-east by the Sooswa, discharging themselves, as already mentioned, the former into the Jumna, the latter into the Ganges. The town of Dehra, situate on this ridge, has an elevation of 2,369 feet; the source of the Asun, an elevation of 2,148; that of the Sooswa, which river takes its rise a few hundred yards from the former, has the like elevation. These rivers flow along the north-eastern base of the Sewalik range, the surface of the valley in general having a considerable slope to that part, and in consequence, nearly all the supplies to those rivers proceed from the north-eastern side of the valley. The formations of the Sewalik are recent, or tertiary in the con-\n\ndoon.\" Dehra is the chief place of the valley, so that Dehra Doon may mean \"the Dehra valley.\"\n\n* The districts of Jounsar and Bawur were disjoined from the raj of Sirmour, and annexed to the British territories, upon the expulsion of the Ghoorkas in 1815.\n\n1 De Cruz, Pol. Relations, 389.\nDEHRA DOON.\n\nventional language of geologists, and for the most part are composed of calcareous sandstone, clay conglomerate, or marl, containing a vast profusion of fossil remains of mammalia, fishes, reptiles, and testacea. The more elevated range on the north and north-east frontier consists generally of what in the same language are styled transition formations, compact limestone, devoid of organic remains, clay-slate, greywacke, with occasionally dykes of trap and other stone, of supposed igneous origin, with extensive overlying beds of quartzy sandstone, and in many places large beds of quartz. The transverse elevation connecting the Sewalik and north-eastern ranges, appears to be of loosely-aggregated diluvial formation, from the fact stated by Jacquemont, that the wells at the town of Dehra, situate on the crest, are nearly 200 feet deep.\n\nThe climate is marked by a range of temperature not inconsiderable. Dr. Royle states it to vary from $37^\\circ$ to $101^\\circ$; and he adds, that snow occasionally falls in winter. In 1841 the mean heat of June, the hottest month, was $88^\\circ$; of December, the coldest, $60^\\circ$; and of the whole year, $74^\\circ$. Other observations, made some years earlier, give results not greatly differing from these; the mean temperature of January, which in this instance was the coldest month, being $52^\\circ$; that of June, the hottest, $86^\\circ$; and that of the whole year, $70^\\circ$.\n\nIn 1839, the total fall of rain was sixty-seven inches; of which fifteen fell in July, and twenty-six in August. October was the driest month; the next in degree April; the next December, and then November. During the dry season, and in cleared situations, the climate is as healthy as in any part of India. \"During the rains, however, and in consequence of the rich and rank vegetation in which the whole valley is clothed, from being under the action of numberless small streams, from the formation in the lower ground of extensive and stagnant marshes, and more especially from the miasma exhaled from the growth and increase of the underwood, as also of the trees themselves composing these mighty forests, fevers somewhat peculiar and local are generated; and in fact, for a European constitution at the above season, even a journey through, far more a residence in these wilds, would be certain\n\n* By the Hon. F. Shore. The year in which these observations were made is not stated.\nof producing them.\" The most unhealthy months are July, August, and September, during which the periodical rains fall; and it is stated, that of the large number of individuals engaged in the extensive grants of land made by the government in 1837, not one person, European or native, escaped fever during the unhealthy period. Hopes, however, are entertained, that by clearance of the jungle and drainage of the swamps, the deadly malaria may be removed, or its effects materially mitigated. The Dehra Doon is not under the influence of the hot winds.\n\nThe general aspect of the country is very pleasing, according to the account of Herbert, who was well acquainted with it. He says, \"The appearance of this valley is highly picturesque, particularly in the neighbourhood of Dehra. The intermixture of cultivation, in which the fields are defined by hedges, with patches of green, over which are scattered fine groves of trees; the undulation of the surface and its intersection by numerous streams, are features that might almost remind one of the scenery of England. The proximity of lofty mountains, occasionally clothed with forests, in which the pine, oak, and walnut are conspicuous, gives a variety to the landscape, which, viewed at a favourable season, is picturesque and beautiful in a high degree. The soil is gravelly, yet, to judge from the cultivation, far from poor.\" Jacquemont's impressions of the country appear to have been somewhat different; but he describes them with much liveliness. \"Notwithstanding its solitude and elevation, Dehra, more than any other part of India, recalls to my mind the tropical scenes which I for the first time saw in America. The bold outlines of the mountains, and the varied tints of the forests with which they are covered, indeed, at first reminded me of scenes in the Alps; but the abundance of plantains (bananas) caused my thoughts to turn to Haiti. The varied productions of nature appear to be wonderfully affected by different circumstances. Numerous forms of the tropical vegetation of the plains of India abound here, though in a climate differing by a more continued prevalence of moisture, a partial exemption from hot winds, and a greater degree of cold in winter; but there is a resemblance in the solstitial rains, one of the most striking circumstances of intertropical meteorology. Those rains, which prevail throughout\nDEHRA DOON.\n\nthe whole southern declivity of the Himalaya, even to the greatest height, are the cause why the tropical forms of vegetation are found mingled with the Alpine at a height exceeding 6,000 feet above the sea.\"\n\nArborescent vegetation is greatly developed, and covers the uncultivated parts with dense and almost impenetrable forests, consisting of trees, many of which are common in more southern parts of India; and arborescent species of genera of which the herbaceous ones are found in the colder parts of the world. Here also occur plants found not only in Southern India, but even under the equator. A large number of each class are enumerated by Dr. Royle.\n\nThe zoology is important, comprising the elephant, wild buffalo, tiger, leopard, hyena, lynx, jackal, wild hog, bear, deer, and the four-horned antelope. Of quadrumanous animals, there are the langur (Simia entallus) and bandar (Simia rhesus). A species of python is met with, as might be expected in a tract so congenial to the nature of those reptiles.\n\nThe soil is in general a deep rich mould, though in some places composed of shingle or gravel swept down by the torrents from the mountains. For the most part, the soil and climate are adapted to the successful growth of rice, maize, gram (Cicer arietinum), cotton, sugar, opium, hemp, indigo, plantain; and, according to a statement in a late work of good authority, \"every English plant thrives luxuriantly in the Dhoon, where in March, April, and May, a splendid show of English flowers is to be seen in all the gardens.\" The eminent botanists, Dr. Royle and Dr. Falconer, who had ample means of local\n\n* Jacquemont unaccountably asserts that there are no elephants in these tracts:\u2014\"Les for\u00eats du sommet des plaines qui s'\u00e9tendent imm\u00e9diatement le long des montagnes, celles qui sont indiqu\u00e9es sur la plupart des cartes comme le s\u00e9jour des \u00e9l\u00e9phants, des rhinoc\u00e9ros, des tigres, &c.; mais les deux premiers de ces animaux ne s'y trouvent pas, ou ne s'y trouvent plus.\" Foster, however, states that elephants abounded between Lal-Dong and Hurdwar, and that they were captured for the sake of their tusks; and in the steps taken for measuring a base in the Dehra Doon, in conducting the trigonometrical survey of the Himalaya, wild elephants were found troublesome. Mundy also mentions, that in the same vicinity they attacked his baggage-elephants.\n\n\u2020 It is, however, stated in a modern publication, that \"the antelope was never seen wild in the Dhoon.\"\nDEHRA DOON.\n\ninformation, considered the south-western declivity of the range rising north of the Dehra Doon as well suited for the successful growth of tea. The result of the experiments made in consequence has amply justified the sagacity of their conjectures. Tea has been produced of a quality which has commanded the approval of the best professional judges. According to the latest reports, the plant was thriving in different localities, extending over four degrees of latitude and three of longitude, and it was believed that in Dehra Doon alone there were 100,000 acres suitable for its growth.\n\nThe statistics of the annual produce and consumption of sugar are stated as follow. The consumption, it will be seen, vastly exceeds the home supply.\n\nEstimated cultivation of cane in beegahs of 14,400 square feet, 3,149.\n\nEstimated produce of goor from cane, in maunds of 80 pounds each, 8,600.\n\nAverage produce per beegah, maunds 2 29 3\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nEstimated consumption of the district, whether in sugar, kaur, goor, or the raw cane, in maunds of 80 pounds, 67,725.\n\nNumber of pounds per head on which estimate is based, 96.\n\nQuantity consumed above the produce, 59,125 maunds.\n\nIn 1837 extensive grants were made by government in the Dehra Doon. The terms were a forty years' lease, under which one-fourth was to be rent-free for the whole term, and the remainder for three years; after the expiration of which the twentieth part of the rent assigned was to be paid, rising annually in twentieths, until, at the end of the twenty-third year, the maximum rent of four annas per beegah, or twelve annas per acre, should become payable.* The grants in the first instance amounted to something less than 30,000 acres, and the grantees having expended large sums in conveying emigrants and cleaning and cultivating the lands, saw reason, as the year advanced, to anticipate their reward in crops of the finest quality; but on the setting in of the rains, the jungle-fever became so general, that from death, the prostration of\n\n* It would appear, that previously such measures were discountenanced. Mr. Shore, long the political agent here, entertained, or expressed an opinion, \"that an acquaintance with Europeans contaminated the natives,\" and was even averse \"to too general a rage for visiting the mountains.\"\nDEHRA DOON.\n\ndisease disabling many who survived, and the departure of others in terrified flight, scarcely any hands remained to gather the harvest, which consequently rotted where it grew. The circumstances of the country, however, in regard to health, appear, as already intimated; to be improvable, and better results are looked for. It does not appear that the expectations of the grantees have been generally realized, as, in some instances at least, they have withdrawn from the speculation.\n\nAt the time the valley was wrested from the rajah of Gurwhal by the Ghoorkas, it is said to have yielded an annual revenue of 10,000l., though those invaders could never realize more than 2,000l. from it. Under British rule its prosperity has evidently advanced.\n\nThe number of mouzahs or townships in Deyrah Doon proper is 214. The area is 673 square miles, or 431,240 British statute acres. The following statement shows the respective proportions of assessed and unassessed land. The former, termed malgoozaree, being divided into cultivated and cultivable; in the latter, lakhiraj or land yielding revenue, which, however, is alienated from government, either for public or private purposes, being discriminated from that which is barren.\n\n| Malgoozaree, or assessed land | Cultivated acres........ | 40,196 |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------|\n| Minhae, or unassessed land    | Culturable acres ...... | 67,791 |\n|                               | Lakhiraj acres ......... | 17,865 |\n|                               | Barren acres ........... | 305,388 |\n\n431,240\n\nThe people are of mixed character. The Mussulman portion of them resemble those of the adjacent plains, in their high and strongly-marked features, full beard, and general figure: the Hindoos, on the other hand, exhibit traces of the blood of their Ghoorka conquerors. According to Jacquemont, they are a lively, inoffensive, and honest race. Their dress is poor and simple, consisting of a small gown, and a cotton wrapper on the head. The lower order have merely a small swathe around the loins.\n\nThe following returns of the population of the Deyrah Doon\n\n* Herbert states the amount at 8,000l.\nDEHRAH.\n\nproper are the result of a census made in the year 1845. They include men and women, adults and children, of all ages.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Hindoo} & \\quad \\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{Agricultural} & 18,534 \\\\\n\\text{Non-agricultural} & 4,856\n\\end{array} \\\\\n\\text{Mahomedan and others not Hindoo} & \\quad \\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{Agricultural} & 4,783 \\\\\n\\text{Non-agricultural} & 3,910\n\\end{array}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTotal \\(\\ldots\\ldots\\ldots\\ldots\\) 32,083\n\nThe above gives a proportion of something more than forty-seven persons to each square mile.\n\nThe district (including Jaunsa Bawar) is under the charge of a superintendent; but the judicial administration is connected with that of Saharunpore, and subordinate to it.\n\nPreviously to the Goorkha invasion of the Dehra Doon, in 1803, it was regarded as the most valuable part of the dominions of the rajah of Gurwhal, who frequently resided at Dehra, and made his final stand at the village of Gurudwara, in its vicinity, where he was defeated and slain. The invasion of the valley by the British, in 1815, during the Nepaul war, was marked by the obstinate, though ineffectual, defence which the Goorkhas made at Kalunga or Nalapani, and the fall of General Gillespie and a considerable number of men under its walls. On the final expulsion of the Ghoorkhas, it became a British district.\n\nDEHRAH, the principal place of the Dehrah Doon, is situate on the crest of a ridge of moderate height, extending from the Sewalik range to that bounding the valley on the north-east. It is situate amidst an extensive and dense grove of very luxuriant mango-trees, and surrounded by verdure, the vicinity being watered by a torrent descending from the mountains. As the intermitting nature of the stream renders the supply of water from it precarious, the town is in dry weather supplied from several wells, nearly 200 feet deep. Jacquemont describes the place as a very large village, consisting of several cottages; and in a letter, bearing date May, 1842, it is mentioned as \"a large town, in the neighbourhood of which are many houses, the property of Europeans.\" Its situation is favourable for traffic, being at the intersection of the route from Hurdwar to Sirmoor with that from Saharunpore and\n\n* See NALAPANI.\nDEH\u2014DEJ.\n\nthe plains to the British sanitary stations of Mussouree and Landour, and to Western Gurwhal. Whatever may be the present prosperity of Dehra, it must have resulted from British rule; for in the account of the trigonometrical survey of the Himalaya, drawn up about 1820, where it is noticed as one of the stations of small triangles, the town is said to be \"small and poor.\" Mundy, writing eight years later, describes it as inconsiderable, but with good cantonments, and a handsome temple, built of stone, and embellished externally with designs in stucco.

It consists of a number of fortifications crowning several eminences, and connected by a single mud wall pierced with loopholes. Here, in January, 1843, the British army was encamped during the advance of Sir Charles Napier to destroy Emaum Ghur. Though stronger than most of the fortresses of Sinde, Dejeekote is open to capture by escalade. There is a large tower, which was intended to contain the treasure of the Ameer, and which is covered by an irregular outwork in a singular style.

It is bounded on the north by the British district of Paneeput; on the east by the Jumna, separating it from the British districts of Meerut and Boolundshuhur; on the south by Bullubgurh and the British district of Goorgaon; and on the west by the district of Rhotuck, and by Buhardoorgurh and Jhujur. It lies between lat. 28\u00b0 24'\u201428\u00b0 54', long. 76\u00b0 49'\u201477\u00b0 29', and has an area of 602\u00b2 square miles. The population in 1848 amounted to 306,550. Of this number, 85,448 are returned as Hindoo and agricultural; 129,066 as Hindoo non-agricultural; 9,227 as Mahometans, and others not Hindoo, agricultural; and 82,809 of those classes non-agricultural. Nearly one-half the entire population of the district is concentrated in the city of Delhi;\u00b2 and if the suburbs be included, the proportion will be found to exceed one-half. Exclusive of the city and its suburbs, the district is divided into two pergunnahs,\u2014northern and southern. Of these, the former is far the more populous, as it contains only 172,126 British statute acres, and has a population of 74,917; while the southern pergunnah, with an area of 211,634 acres, has a population of only 71,354. In both pergunnahs, the Hindoo population greatly preponderates; its proportion to the number of other classes being, in round numbers, about thirteen to two. But in the city and suburbs of Delhi, long the seat of a powerful Mahomedan monarchy, the proportion becomes little more than eight to seven.\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C.

The southern part is barren,\\(^6\\) with an uneven surface of rocky\\(^6\\) ridges. The aspect of the country is thus described by Dr. Royle:\\(^7\\)\u2014\"Delhi, the capital of Northern India, situate on the western bank of the Jumna, nearly at the upper part of the inclined slope which forms the plains of India, is elevated about 800 feet above the level of the sea. The soil is barren, and remarkable for its saline efflorescence; and the wells, for the brackishness of their water. The rocky soil, always exposed to the solar rays, absorbs much heat, and a high temperature, with considerable dryness, is produced in the hot weather; but from the openness of the country, and exposure to the winds which pass over extensive lakes in the vicinity, a greater degree of cold is produced in winter than we should otherwise expect. We do not, therefore, find in Flora round Delhi, such plants as Guttiferae, Anonaceae, and Strychnaceae, which, requiring moisture with heat, flourish in the southern provinces of India. But the climate in general being favourable, and the minimum of cold not long-continued, we find many of the plants which are common in warmer parts of India, but which are not found at Saharunpore.\"\n\nThe climate being in general dry,\\(^8\\) and the soil for the most part either sandy or rocky, requires consequently to be fertilized by frequent applications of moisture. The principal alimentary crops are barley, wheat, and pulse. The demand of government in this district, on account of the land revenue, amounted, in 1846-47, to 34,967l. The assessment has been fixed for a series of years, and is not liable to increase until the year 1870.\\(^9\\) The district is intersected by the grand trunk road from Calcutta, and is also connected with Meerut by means of an excellent road, completed some years ago.\\(^1\\) That a tract having inconsiderable natural resources, should for so long a period have contained the capital of a vast empire, seems extraordinary. It probably resulted from the progress\n\n* The jhil of Farrukhnagar, already mentioned.\nDELHI.\n\nof the conquest of Hindostan, previously to the British sway, having always been from the west to the east. Delhi, consequently, was found the best station for maintaining political and military communication between the Deccan and the great valley of the Ganges on the one side, and on the other the Punjab and Afghanistan, usually the base of operations to invaders.\n\nDELHI. \u2014 A celebrated city, the principal place of the British district of the same name, under the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces. The site of the present city is a low rocky range, about a mile from the right bank of the Jumna, and on an offset of that river, which leaves the main stream five miles above the town, and rejoins it two miles below. The approach from the south-east, or the direction of Agra, is very striking, from the innumerable ruinous monuments of former prosperity and grandeur. \"Everywhere throughout the plain, rise shapeless half-ruined obelisks, the relics of massive Patan architecture, their bases being buried under heaps of ruins bearing a dismal growth of thorny shrubs. Everywhere one treads on overthrown walls. Brick mosaics mark the ground-plan of the humbler dwellings of the poorer classes. Among the relics of a remote age, are occasionally to be seen monuments of light and elegant style of architecture, embellished with brilliant colours, gilt domes, and minarets encased in enamelled tiles.\" These surprising collections of ruins are the remains of the ancient city of Delhi, which, according to Wilford, extended above thirty miles along the banks of the Jumna. The present city, founded by Shahjehan in 1631, is about seven miles in circumference, and inclosed on three sides by a fine wall, which is interrupted towards the river. Shahjehan disposed along this defence a few weak towers scarcely projecting from it; but since the acquisition of the city by the British, it has been strengthened.\n\n* The spelling is various in various authors.

As the curtains are extensive, small external martello towers have been constructed, to bring the foot of the walls under the fire of musketry.\u2020 The tops of but few houses appear above the ramparts, over which rise graceful acacias, and still overtopping these, lofty detached date-trees; while the minarets of mosques, and tombs shaded with the gloomy foliage of the salvadora, are scattered over the glacis. The Jumma Musjeed,\u2021 or principal mosque, and the palace, displaying a very high and extensive cluster of towers and battlements, rise above all, and render the external aspect of the place very imposing. Franklin\u00a7 enumerates seven gates,\u2014the Lahore, Ajmere, Turkoman, Delhi, Moor or Mohur, Caubul, and Kashmere. Bacon,\u00b6 who visited the place ten or twelve years ago, gives the same number, but styles the Caubul the Agra gate. The actual number, however, appears to be eleven,**\u2014the Cashmere, Lahore, Caubul, Buddurnao, Ajmere, Turkoman, Delhi, Rajghat, Negumbod, Lall, and Kaila gates. The last four are on the river face. The Cashmere gate has casemated apartments for the accommodation of the city-guard, which is stationed there. The streets are for the most part narrow, but the Chandni Chauk,\u2020\u2020 or principal street, which runs north and south from the gate of the palace to the Delhi gate of the city, a length of about three quarters of a mile, is fifty yards wide, having good shops\u2021\u2021 on both sides. It is also remarkably clean, a small raised watercourse\u00a7\u00a7 flowing down the middle of the street in a channel of red stone.\u00b6\u00b6 There is another large street running east and west, from the gate of the palace to the Lahore gate of the city, but it is inferior to the Chandni Chauk, though like it provided with a watercourse.\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 The inhabitants have, however, spoiled the appearance of both by erecting houses in\n\n* Hamilton\u00b9 states that the walls are \"faced along their whole extent with substantial masonry, constructed of large blocks of a bright-grey granite.

In the Chandni Chauk is situate the imperial palace, described by Heber\\(^1\\) as one of the noblest kingly residences he had ever seen; far surpassing the Kremlin, though not equal to Windsor.\\(^2\\) It is inclosed on three sides\\(^3\\) by a wall of red granite, a mile in circumference, and about\\(^4\\) forty feet high, flanked with turrets and cupolas. It is very beautifully built, and has two noble gateways, each defended by a barbican. On the remaining side it is defended by the river (the branch of the Jumna), over which is a narrow bridge,\\(^5\\) forming a communication with the old fort of Selimghur, on the eastern bank. That antique fort is supposed to have been raised by some early Patan sovereign, and is in a very heavy, massive style of architecture, devoid of ornaments, except a few rude carvings on the mouldings and cornices. The entrance to the palace is through a succession of noble and very lofty gateways, built of red granite\\(^6\\) highly sculptured; the principal one is described by Heber\\(^7\\) in the same terms which he applies to the palace generally. A splendid Gothic arch in the centre of the great tower is succeeded by a long vaulted aisle, like that of a Gothic cathedral, with a small open octagonal court in its centre, all of granite, and all ornamented with inscriptions from the Koran, and finely-carved flowers. The Dewani Khas, or \"private council-chamber,\" is a pavilion of white marble,\\(^8\\) surmounted by four cupolas of the same material,\\(^9\\) and open on one side to the court of the palace, on the other to its garden. Its pillars and arches are exquisitely carved and ornamented with arabesques gilt and inlaid, flowers, and inscriptions,\\(^*\\) in the most elaborate Persian character. A rich foliage of silver, which formerly graced the ceiling, has been long since carried off. At present this splendid and tasteful hall is seldom entered by the emperor, and is in a very filthy state, being the retreat of crows, kites, and other unclean birds.\\(^1\\) The garden, though now quite neglected and desolate, was formerly extremely beautiful, and refreshed by numerous\n\n\\(^*\\) Heber\\(^1\\) says, \"Round the frieze is the motto recorded, I believe, in Lalla Rookh:\u2014\n\n\"If there be an Elysium on earth\nIt is this, it is this!\"\nelegant fountains of white marble, supplied from an aqueduct of the same material. Within its inclosure is an octagonal pavilion of white marble, containing a fountain and an elegantly-ornamented bath, and consisting of three very large apartments surmounted by white marble domes; but all is now mutilated and defaced with dirt. The Moti-masjid, or private mosque for the court, is an elegant little building of white marble, exquisitely carved, but, like the rest, neglected and dilapidated. The Dewanee-a\u00fbm, or public hall of audience, is a large and splendid pavilion of marble, but now fallen into ruin and neglect, the throne, when seen by Heber, being nearly covered with pigeon's dung. Near the palace, and in the Chandni Chauk, is the small mosque of Roshun-a-Dowlah, from which Nadir Shah witnessed the massacre of the inhabitants of Delhi by his troops. The Jumma Musjid, or principal mosque, is situate on a small rocky eminence, of such height that the platform from which the structure rises, overtops the adjacent houses, and is thirty feet above the general level of the city. This platform or court, a square of 450 feet, is paved with red stone, and on each of three sides is entered through a large gateway, approached from below by flights of stone steps. In the middle is a marble reservoir for water, filled by several fountains supplied from a canal by means of machinery, and intended for the ablutions required in the Mahomedan ceremonial. On three sides the court is skirted by open arcades, with octagonal pavilions at convenient intervals; the west is occupied by the mosque, a splendid structure of an oblong form, 261 feet in length, and approached by another magnificent flight of stone steps. The whole front is faced with large slabs of fine white marble, and along the cornice are ten compartments, four feet long and two and a half broad, inlaid with numerous inscriptions from the Koran, in the Nuskhi character, executed in black marble. The interior is paved with flags of white marble, three feet long and a foot and a half broad; and the walls and roof are lined with the same material.\n\n* Heber states \"very advantageously.\" Bacon, on the contrary: \"The position is not felicitous, being in a low, dirty part of the city, amid narrow streets and meanly-built houses.\" It is presumed, the epithet \"low\" is not intended to indicate deficiency of elevation, but applies to the character of the neighbourhood.\nDELHI.\n\nstructure is surmounted by three domes\\(^7\\) of white marble intersected with black stripes, and at each extremity of the front is a minaret\\(^8\\) of considerable height, and having a winding staircase of 130 steps of red stone, by which access is obtained to the summit, whence is a fine and extensive view of the city, with its palaces, mosques, and battlemented walls, as well as of the surrounding country, widely overspread with monuments and other buildings in every stage of decay. Attached to the mosque is a large and deep well,\\(^9\\) said to be excavated in solid rock, and from which the water is raised by means of complicated machinery and a succession of reservoirs. In 1809, the machinery became so much decayed as to be unserviceable, until repaired by the British authorities. Hamilton\\(^6\\) seems to intimate that the fountains in the court of the mosque are supplied from this source, and not from a canal, as stated by Heber. The Jumma mosque was commenced by Shahjehan\\(^\u2020\\) in the fourth year of his reign, and completed in the tenth, at an expense\\(^1\\) of about 100,000l. English money. Authority was given in 1851 for the repair of the building.\\(^2\\) Of the other religious buildings, the only one worthy of much notice is the Kala\\(^\u2021\\) Masjad, or Black Mosque, so called from the dark hue given it by time. It is a structure of no great size, in a plain massive style of architecture, according to the plan of the primitive Arabian mosques, and consists of a square\\(^3\\) court, surrounded by an arcade, and surmounted by numerous small ill-shaped domes. It is generally supposed to have been built by some of the early Affghan sovereigns.\n\nNear the Cashmere gate is an English church,\\(^4\\) erected at the cost of 10,000l., by the munificence of Colonel Skinner, a highly distinguished commander of irregular troops in the East-India Company's service.\n\nThough above one-half of the population of the city consists of Hindoos, their temples\\(^5\\) are mean, in consequence perhaps of the general poverty of the votaries of the Hindoo creed.\n\nThe many gorgeous palaces of the nobles of Delhi, which once\n\n---\n\n\\(^7\\) Heber, i. 556.\n\\(^8\\) Bacon, ii. 280.\n\\(^9\\) Description of Hindoostan, i. 491.\n\\(^1\\) Franklin, ut supra, 424.\n\\(^2\\) India Pol.

Considerable improvements have, however, taken place since the acquisition of the city by the British, who have made it more cleanly, built a court of justice, and, for the resident, a palace, which is surrounded by several fine houses in the Italian style of architecture. A great number of houses have also been built by the native inhabitants, the number of whom is considerably on the increase.\n\nDuring the prosperity of the city, all parts were copiously supplied with water by means of a canal, made, at vast expense and with much skill, by Ali Murdan Khan, a munificent Persian, of great ability, and high in command under Shah Jehan. Drawing its supply from the canal of Feroz Shah, near Rair, a distance of seventy miles, this great watercourse, as it approaches the city, is conducted along the summit of a prolonged artificial mound, of such an elevation that the bottom of the channel is much higher than the surrounding country; holding its course, by means of an aqueduct of masonry, over a considerable depression, and skirting the north-eastern base of the range of rocky hills stretching westward from Delhi, the stream is finally led across it, in a channel cut through the solid rock for nearly three miles, being twenty-five feet in breadth, twenty-five in depth, generally, but in one place sixty feet. It then enters the city, and, passing through it by an open channel, traverses another long extensive aqueduct, by which it reaches the palace, throughout the whole of which it ramifies, in open or covered courses, having outlets to the Jumna; thus diffusing constant streams of fresh water. In like manner, in the space between the range of hills and the palace, numerous underground channels were cut, leading to the various residences of the nobles, and the different divisions of the city; yielding to the whole city and its suburbs a supply of good water, from open well-shafts connected with these subterraneous watercourses. On a review of the ancient works in Delhi connected with the canal, it is obvious that money must have been expended with a most lavish hand, to effect even that of which the existence is known; and much is yet hidden in the ruins of the neighbourhood. According to Polier, a watercourse ran\nDELHI.\n\nthrough every principal street; and such a copious and pure supply was inestimable to Delhi, as the water of the Jumna in the neighbourhood of the city, impregnated with natron, is disagreeable and unwholesome. If, as stated, Ali Murdan Khan served Shahjehan from 1638 to 1656, the canal must have been made in that interval. The resulting revenue appears to have been assigned as a remuneration to the officer who provided for the requisite repairs; as Safdar-jang, the father of Shoojah-oo-dowlah, the nawaub of Oude, is alleged to have derived an annual revenue of 250,000l. from it.*\n\nIn the course of the revolt of Safdar Jang, in 1752, and the subsequent disorders and disasters of Delhi, the canal went to ruin, and the supply of water was cut off; and though subsequently restored, at a cost of 10,000l., by Ahmed Shah Dooranee, in one of his temporary occupations of the city, it again became unserviceable through neglect, and the supply was interrupted, until, in 1820, the requisite repairs having been effected by the British authorities, the watercourses and conduits of the city were again set flowing, to the unspeakable joy of the inhabitants, who went out in jubilee to meet the stream, throwing flowers and other offerings into the water, and imploring blessings on the government.\n\nWhen the prosperity of Delhi was at its meridian, there was, near the left bank of the Jumna, opposite the palace, an imperial preserve and pleasure-ground, surrounded by numerous palaces of the nobles; and to supply these, as well as to irrigate the Doab, Ali Mardan made another canal, which, drawing its supply from the Jumna on its left side, nearly opposite the commencement of Feroz Shah\u2019s work, proceeded\n\n* It appears that the direct revenue derived from the Delhi canal in the two years ending 1838, amounted to 50,000 rupees above the entire ordinary expenditure for maintenance and management, while the indirect revenue from increased fertilization in the four districts of the Delhi territory (including Jheend) benefited by the canal, is assumed at 132,635 rupees; and after making some deductions, the annual income to the Company\u2019s treasury from the canals is estimated at 170,000 rupees, upon an outlay of about eleven lacs (110,000l.), which gives a return of nearly 15\u00bd per cent. The financial results are thus highly satisfactory, whilst the other effects, rendering hundreds of villages populous, flourishing, and almost independent of drought and the fluctuations of seasons, and in securing a large population from famine and distress, are highly gratifying.\nin a direction in some measure parallel with the parent stream, for a distance of 135 miles, and rejoined it abreast of the city. This work, known by the name of the Doab Canal, having also gone to ruin through neglect, was repaired by the British authorities, and the flow of water restored, in January, 1830.\n\nAccording to a recent census (1845-46), the city of Delhi contains 187,977 inhabitants; of which number, 71,530 are stated to be Hindoos, 66,120 Mahomedans, and 327 Christians. The inhabitants of the palace of the titular sovereign are not included in the above return; but they cannot be numerous, as nearly all the servants of the permanent residents pass the nights outside its inclosure, returning to their duties in the morning. But besides the city, there are extensive suburbs\u2014\u201cthe Islington, Clerkenwell, &c., of Delhi,\u201d as the British officiating collector termed them. According to a census made in 1847, these contain a population amounting to 22,302. The entire population of Delhi and its suburbs consequently exceeds 160,000. According to a table, published in the local Gazette, of the amount of traffic crossing the bridge of boats at Delhi, in 1852, the number of buffaloes is returned at upwards of 100,000, of mules and ponies 84,000, and of hackeries 65,000.\n\nThe Delhi College is under the management of a local committee or council, composed partly of European and partly of native members. The college was founded in 1792. In 1829, Nawwab Itmad-ood-Dowlah, formerly minister of the king of Oude, endowed the college with the sum of 170,000 rupees, the interest of which produces 7,253 rupees per annum; and this sum, added to the government grants and assignments, raises its gross receipts to the sum of 40,580 rupees per annum. The institution is divided into four departments,\u2014English, Arabic, Persian, and Sanscrit. On the 30th April, 1851, the number of students was as follows: Christians, 22; Mahomedans, 206; Hindoos, 105; giving a total of 333.\n\nAt the time of Heber\u2019s visit, in 1824, the exterior of the palace of the emperor was guarded by the troops of the East-India Company, but the internal duties were performed by a provisional corps, raised in the name of the local sovereign, and nominally under his orders. During Bacon\u2019s visit, several years afterwards, one corps in the East-India Company\u2019s service was stationed within the city, the remainder of the\ngarrison being cantoned outside the walls. The arsenal is situate on the bank of the Jumna, and at the time of the visit of Von Orlich, in February, 1843, contained 110 guns, of different calibre, and other arms of various kinds, arranged with great care and taste. The powder-magazine, until a very recent period, was situate within the walls of the city. Its dangerous position was brought to notice in the year 1850, and orders were given for its removal. It seems unaccountable, that for the deposit of such stores a site should have been so long retained in the midst of a great city, and nearly three miles from the military cantonment.\n\nThe surrounding country is widely overspread with vast ruins, principally of Indreput or Delhi, the seat of empire previously to the foundation of the present walled town of Shahjehanabad. This scene of desolation extends from the garden of Shahlimar, north-west of the present town, to some distance beyond the Kuthb Minar, nine miles south of it. Even on the north-west, where the extent of dilapidated remains is smaller, the road is a \"continued avenue of ruined tombs, gardens, serais, and palaces,\" up to the walls of Delhi. The Shahlimar, made by Shahjehan, in 1632, is a mile in circumference, and is popularly reported to have cost a million sterling; but it is now in such a ruined state, as to present little evidence of such expenditure. Thorn says, \"Shah Jehan evinced, in the construction of these gardens, the same taste for picturesque beauty and sublimity as he did genius in building and other works of art. Here every provision was made to render seclusion pleasant, to gratify the senses, to soften the cares of royalty, and to beguile the tedium of life. Pavilions, pleasure-houses, and baths, invited to refreshment and repose, while grottos and groves afforded ample protection from the intensity of the solar heat.\" This once splendid retreat is surrounded by a high brick wall, having, at intervals, octagonal pavilions of red stone, but all much dilapidated, the only vestiges of its former attractions being a number of trees, of great size and age, amidst which is situate the country mansion, built some years since by the British resident. No traces of walls mark out the extent of ancient Delhi; but the ruins extend over a tract altogether about thirty miles in cir-\n\n* A corruption of Shahlamarat, \"the King's Edifice.\"\n\n7 Bengal Mil.

It may be that this vast area was at no one time continuously occupied by buildings, but that the population shifted from place to place, and thus different parts became in succession covered with habitations. A few hundred paces to the south of the present city, is the Kotela or citadel of Feroz Shah, formerly the fortress of the old city, within the north-western angle of which it is situate. On one side it was washed by the Jumna, which now seldom reaches it, except in very heavy floods. The works of this citadel were very extensive; but the architecture is clumsy in style and rough in execution, and has no pretence to aught but strength. The material is the rough wrought stone found on the spot, which is too hard to admit of being better worked. The Kotela was to old Delhi what the Lal Killa is to the present city, and was probably considered an elegant building in remote times.\n\nRising from the terraced roof of a building at the bottom of the courtyard, is a pillar, popularly called the Lath or Staff of Feroz Shah, the visible part measuring thirty-seven feet in length, and ten feet four inches in girth at the base. It is a single shaft of red sandstone, without any joint, and is thought by Prinsep to have been quarried in the Sewalik Mountains at Rajpur, on the bank of the Jumna. It bears several inscriptions, some in Sanscrit, of a comparatively modern date (as late as the twelfth century); of others, \u201cthe language differs essentially from every existing written idiom: it is, as it were, intermediate between the Sanscrit and the Pali.\u201d The most ancient of these inscriptions purports to have proceeded from Asoka, surnamed Pirjadassi, a Buddhist monarch, anointed 325 years before the Christian era, and its tenor is the inculcation of some of the observances of that sect. The building, on the roof of which is the pillar, stands close to the ramparts of the river-face. It is square, and has three stories in height, all vaulted. Its use seems to be matter of uncertainty. There are buildings near to this which may have been appropriated to the purposes of a menagerie; but in the judgment of Prinsep, that on which the pillar stands was not so employed. The most probable conjecture is, that it was a summer-house. Heber erroneously describes the shaft as \u201ca high black pillar of cast metal, called Feroze\u2019s Walking-stick,\u201d and Bacon unaccountably represents it as standing on the ground.\nDELHI.\n\nSimilar monuments, with the same Buddhist inscriptions, are found at Allahabad, and two other places in India of less celebrity. The popular name has resulted from the pillar having been re-erected in its present position (probably about 1355) by Feroz Shah, the Patan monarch of Delhi. Close to the elevated terraced roof on which this pillar stands, are the ruins of a large mosque. The old Patan fort, contiguous on the south to these various buildings, is inclosed by walls sixty feet high. At each angle is a circular bastion, and in the middle of each side a gateway, defended by two round towers, pierced with loopholes. About a mile and a half south of this is the tomb of Humayon, the emperor, who, after being driven from his kingdom, succeeded in re-establishing the Mogul dynasty on the throne of Delhi. It stands in the middle of a platform 200 feet square, supported on every side by arcades, and ascended by four great flights of stone steps. Each arch of the arcades serves as a receptacle of one or more tombs. The mausoleum of the sovereign, rising on the platform, is a noble building, of a square form, constructed of red stone, inlaid with marble, and surmounted by a large dome of the latter material, the style of architecture approaching to that usually termed Saracenic. In the interior is a large circular apartment, in the middle of which is a small white marble sarcophagus, containing the remains of Humayon; and around are smaller apartments, in which are entombed his relatives and more favoured retainers. From the top of the building, the view is striking, being on every side over a wide expanse of ruins, which to the westward extends to a range of hills seven or eight miles distant. Some hundred yards west of this mausoleum is a collection of burial-places and small mosques, the most remarkable structure being the tomb of Nizam-ood-deen, a reputed Mussulman saint, which building is ornamented with elaborate and elegant carvings in white marble. Around, most of the deceased members of the present imperial family lie buried, each within a small inclosure of elegant lattice-work, executed in white marble. Among these monuments is that of the Princess Jahanara, a daughter of Shahjehan. About two miles west of the tomb of Humayon, and four miles south of the city, is the mausoleum of Safdar\n\n* \"About as big as the Ratcliffe library,\" according to Heber.\n\n4 Prinsep, ut supra, 666.\n5 Harrington, ut supra, 177.\n6 Ferishta, i. 449.\n7 Thorn, War in India, 164.\nForbes, Oriental Memoirs, ii. 427.\n8 Bacon, First Impressions, ii. 308.\n9 Heber, i. 563.\nThorn, 165.\n1 Heber, ibid.\n2 Id. i. 554.\nVon Orlch, ii. 38.\nDELHI.\n\nJang, vizier of the empire in the middle of the last century, and ancestor of the present king of Oude. It is composed of arcades, surrounding a large octagonal dome, built of white marble and red sandstone, arranged in alternate parallel perpendicular sections, and contains in its interior the body, deposited in a white marble sarcophagus, beautifully carved. The surrounding garden, as well as the building, is kept in good order by the agent of the king of Oude; but the elegant fountains, which once ornamented and refreshed the scene, are neglected.\n\nA few hundred paces west of the city is an observatory of enormous size, with the following colossal instruments constructed in masonry:\u20141. An equatorial dial, the gnomon of which is 118 feet 7 inches long, with a base of the length of 104 feet 1 inch, and of the perpendicular height of 56 feet 9 inches. This, called by Jey Singh, its constructor, Semrat-Yunter, or \"prince of dials,\" is made of stone, but the edges of the gnomon and the surface for graduation were of white marble, most of which has been torn away. 2. Two smaller equatorial dials, each with a gnomon 35 feet 4 inches long, and having stairs to the top. 3. A wall, on which is delineated a graduated semicircle for taking the latitudes of bodies that lie due east or due west from the eye of the observer. 4. A wall in the plane of the meridian, and bearing a double quadrant, having as centres the two upper corners of the wall, and intended for observing the altitudes of objects passing the meridian. 5. Southward of the great dial, are two circular buildings, of exactly the same size and construction, each 172 feet 6 inches in circumference, and 24 feet 6 inches high, and designed for observing the altitude and azimuth of the heavenly bodies. 6. A concave hemispherical surface, to represent the inferior hemisphere of the heavens, the diameter being 27 feet 5 inches. This observatory (as well as similar structures at Jeypoor, Muttra, Benares, and Oujein, respectively) was made by Jeysingh, rajah of Amber, who was employed by the emperor Mohammed Shah* to reform the calendar.\n\nNine miles south of the city is the celebrated Kutb Minar, probably the highest column in the world. It tapers regularly from the base to the cupola, which, according to Franklin, is\n\n* Who reigned from 1718 to 1748.\ncapable of containing a dozen persons. The exterior is for a great part of the height adorned by fluting, there being twenty-seven projections, alternately round and angular. The column is surrounded by four balconies or galleries, supported by large stone brackets, and having small battlements, which, while they have an ornamental effect, afford some slight security to those who venture on such a giddy footing. The first balcony surrounds the column at the height of ninety feet from the ground, the second at 140, the third at 180, and the fourth at 203 feet. As far as 180 feet, to which the fluting extends, the material is a fine red stone, declared by Jacquemont\\(^1\\) to be unquestionably the compact quartz abounding in the neighbourhood. Above the height of 180 feet, the material is a very fine white marble, the form circular, but not fluted. The cupola, or small dome on the summit, is supported by eight square pillars, and is surrounded by an iron\\(^2\\) gallery, reached by a spiral\\(^*\\) staircase winding up through the interior. The entire height has been ascertained by careful measurements and calculations to be 242 feet 6 inches,\\(^3\\) the diameter at the base 48 feet 2 inches. In 1803, the column was injured by lightning and earthquake; and either from those causes, or from the more gradual influence of time, many stones on the west side have been displaced, so as to cause a vertical crack\\(^4\\) in the staircase and central pillar. A British officer of engineers has repaired the damage to a considerable extent, and has performed the task with great architectural skill. According to Bacon,\\(^5\\) the undertaking was a very bold one, as a very large portion of the masonry at the base of the pillar must have been removed before the new could be substituted. \"The native masons,\" he observes, \"generally a most hardy and adventurous set, were with the greatest possible difficulty brought to put their hands to the labour.\" Of the numerous inscriptions on the exterior of the column, four in Persian have been examined\\(^6\\) by means of a powerful telescope, and copied. Two of them declare that it was erected by Shams-ood-deen Altamsh, a Mussulman king of Delhi, of Turkish\\(^7\\) origin, who reigned from 1210 to 1236. Another inscription,\n\n* According to Franklin,\\(^1\\) of 308 steps; according to Von Orlich, of 383. Thorn states that he ascended 345 steps, but could proceed no farther, on account of the ruinous state of the stairs.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) As.

If, however, these inscriptions refer to different persons, they may be reconciled by supposing that the first-mentioned prince built the lower fluted part, which is composed, as already stated, of red quartz, and that the other added the upper portion, of white marble. In those inscriptions it is also mentioned that certain injuries occasioned by lightning, were repaired in 1529, and again in 1531. The name of Kutb Minar, by which it is popularly called, may have resulted from an inscription over the gate of an adjoining ruined mosque, stating that \"Kutb-ud-din-Ibek, on whom be the mercy of God, constructed this mosque.\" Kutb-ood-deen Ibek reigned in Delhi from 1206 to 1210. About 420 feet north of the Kutb Minar, is a vast unfinished structure of the same kind, but of nearly twice its circumference, though only forty feet high. It is without any clue to explain the era or the motive of its construction. Some have supposed that it was intended with the Kutb Minar to form a pair of minarets to a mosque to be erected on the same stupendous scale; but the discordance in size and structure renders the supposition untenable. Of all the conjectures that have been formed respecting the purpose of raising these vast piles, the most plausible appears to be that they were intended to commemorate the triumph of Islam over Brahminism. Ruins of large and elaborately-constructed buildings, apparently dedicated to the latter faith, are everywhere to be seen about the minars. In a court of one of those ruined edifices, and about 130 feet north-west of the Kutb Minar, is a metal pillar, the part of which above ground is about twenty-six feet high, and one foot in diameter. It has not been ascertained how much is buried, but, according to the characteristic account given by the Hindoos, it rests on the back of the tortoise which upholds the universe. It is popularly believed to be composed of a peculiar alloy, but Jacquemont affirms it to be merely soft iron. About twenty feet north-west of this pillar is a large Mussulman tomb, said to contain the remains of Shams-ood-deen Altamsh, and bearing inscriptions of unascertained meaning. At no great distance is the burial-place of the unfortunate emperor Shah Alum, and close\nDELHI.\n\nto it the country residence of his successors, \"a large but paltry building, in a bad style of Italian architecture, and with a public road actually leading through its courtyard.\"\n\nFour miles nearly due east of this place, and ten miles south of the present city of Delhi, is Toghlukabad, now a vast collection of ruins of buildings, originally constructed of hard red stone, in such a massive style, that it would seem as if nothing but an earthquake were capable of producing the universal destruction everywhere observable. Wilford mentions, on the authority of some early missionaries, that here \"were certain tombs, which were asserted to be those of some ancient princes of Delhi, who were Christians, and lived a little before the invasion of the Mussulmans.\" The most remarkable ruin is that of a fortified mausoleum of the founder, who was probably Feroz Toghluk, celebrated for the number of his public works, and stated by Ferishta to have built in 1354 the city of Farozabad, adjoining that of Delhi. Though Toghlukabad is ten miles from the present Delhi or Shahjehanabad, it must have adjoined the previous or original city of that name.\n\nIn the absence of direct observations respecting the elevation of Delhi above the sea, an approximate estimate may be safely made from careful observations at no great distance. The height of Dasna, sixteen miles due east of the channel of the Jumna, abreast of Delhi, is 821 feet. The slope of the surface from that part of the doab to the river is very gentle, and if assumed at two feet per mile, it will give the elevation of that part of the channel at about 790 feet. Farther, the elevation of Gurgaon, seventeen miles south-west of Delhi, is 817 feet, and as, during the rainy season, an extensive and nearly stagnant piece of water extends between the two places, the inclination of the surface from the former to the latter cannot be great; though undoubtedly there is some declension, as the drainage of the jhil or swamp is into the Jumna, at Delhi.\n\n* Ferishta attributes the foundation of the fortress of Toghlukabad, near Delhi, to Gheias-ood-deen Toghluk, who reigned from 1321 to 1325; but (though generally a faithful recorder) the probability of his account is impaired by his allowing for the completion of this stupendous work, but one year from the accession of the prince, who must have been fully occupied by the multitudinous affairs resulting from an altered succession and a distracted realm.\n\n1 Heber, i. 565.\n3 Bacon, ii. 306.\nHeber, i. 571.\n4 As.

A series of observations, extending over a period of three years, gives the following as the mean temperature in the daytime, of the respective months: January, 56\u00b0; February, 61\u00b0; March, 72\u00b0; April, 83\u00b0; May, 91\u00b0; June, 92\u00b0; July, 86\u00b0; August, 83\u00b0; September, 83\u00b0; October, 77\u00b0; November, 65\u00b0; December, 58\u00b0. Delhi may be regarded as a rather arid district: the fall of rain in 1842 is reported to have been only ten inches. That year, however, was considered a very dry one, even more so than 1837, in which the deficiency of rain was productive of dreadful famine. Smart frosts during the nights of mid-winter afford the means of producing ice, to be stored for a relief during the heats of summer. The earth, which is generally impregnated with mineral salts, especially saltpetre, is moulded into round shallow pans, into which water is poured to the depth of about an inch, and they are set out in rows on layers of split bamboos or hurdles, covered with straw. The frost of the night is sufficient, under such management, to produce ice, which is carefully removed in the morning, and deposited for preservation in deep pits.\n\nIndrapresth or Inderput, the city which formerly occupied the site of the modern city of Delhi, is alleged to have been founded by Yudisthira, whose demise, according to the extravagant chronology of the Hindoos, occurred in the year 3101 before the Christian era. It ceased for several centuries to be the seat of regal government, until re-established by the adventurer Anungpal.* About the year 980, the rajah of Delhi is mentioned as a member of a Hindoo confederacy defeated by Sebektegin, the Ghaznevide, in the Punjab; and again as a member of a similar confederacy, experiencing a like fate from Mahmood of Ghuznee, in 1008. Ferishta, however, in recounting the expedition of that ruler to Kannouj, which was undertaken in 1017, and the subsequent expeditions by which, in 1021 and 1023, he penetrated to Kalleenjur, makes no\n\n* This event is stated by Wilford to have taken place in 1050; by Tod, in 792. Such wide discrepancy between the conclusions of authors who have both given great attention to the subject, shows (what indeed scarcely needed illustration) how little reliance ought to be placed on the Hindoo records.\nmention of Delhi; though in all three enterprises the routes of the invader must have lain at no great distance from it. But on the invasion of India, in 1191, by Mohammed Shahab-u-din of Ghor, Delhi appears as one of the four great Hindoo powers. It was then held in union with Ajmeer, by Pirthi or Pritwi Raj, a Rajpoot prince, who having, on the plains of Sirhind, given battle at the head of a force, according to native estimate comprising 300,000 horse and 8,000 elephants, besides infantry, was defeated, made prisoner, and put to death by the invader. Kutboo-deen, a lieutenant of the victor, took Delhi in 1198, and established there an independent Mahomedan dynasty, known among the Oriental historians as that of \"the slaves of the sultans of Ghor.\" In 1288, the Khiljis or Giljis, adventurers from Afghanistan, having murdered the reigning prince, Keikobad, succeeded in transferring the sovereignty to Jelal-ood-deen, one of their number, and established the Khilji dynasty, which lasted till 1321, when it was terminated by the assassination of Sultan Mobarik, and the supreme power was transferred to Gheias-ood-deen Toghluk, the founder of the Toghluk dynasty. In the reign of Mahmud, of this dynasty, the Tartar conqueror Tamerlane invaded India; and, in 1398, marched to Delhi, the operations against which he prefaced by massacring in cold blood his Hindoo prisoners, reported by native authorities to have been 100,000 in number. After a brief resistance, Mahmud, the sovereign of Delhi, took to flight, the town was plundered and burned, and the inhabitants butchered. According to the account of a panegyrist of the invader, \"high towers were erected of their heads, and their carcases were left a prey to birds and beasts: never were such carnage and desolation known.\" The stay of Tamerlane in Delhi was only of sufficient length to enable him to complete the series of barbarities by which his visit is rendered infamously memorable; and after his departure the city and the adjoining territory remained for nearly half a century in an unsettled state, until the sovereignty was acquired, in 1450, by Behlol, of the Patan or Afghan tribe of Lodi. His grandson, Ibrahim, was, in 1526, defeated and slain, at the battle of Paniput, by the renowned Baber, whose lineal descendant, popularly called down to a late period the Great Mogul,* is at present the titular sovereign. Baber's son\n\n* Erakine observes, that the Moguls \"do not appear to have ever co-\n\n121\nand successor, Humaion, was, in 1540, defeated and expelled from India, by Shir Khan, an adventurer of Patan descent; but receiving assistance from the king of Persia, Humaion recovered his sovereignty, in 1554, by a decisive victory which he gained at Sirhind. The progress of the power of the Moguls in India was more rapid even than that of the British in the same country; as in the reign of Akbar, the son and successor of Humaion, the empire extended from Chittagong in the east, to Candahar in the west, and from Bultistan or Little Thibet in the north, to the southern boundary of Berar at the opposite point. Subsequently, the southern frontier was for a short period extended by the conquests of Aurungzebe to Tanjore. The empire was originally distributed into twelve soubahs or vice-royalties, but the number was ultimately increased to fifteen, for the purpose of comprehending the additions which were the fruits of Akbar's later conquests. The assessed revenue of Akbar, settled by him in the fortieth year of his reign for a term of ten years, amounted to 9,07,43,881 sicca rupees, or about eleven millions sterling.\n\nElphinstone, from Abulfazl, estimates the number of persons bound to render military service at 4,400,000, but the whole number at one time actually drawn out, did not probably much operated heartily with Baber, who always speaks of them and their race with strong marks of dislike and resentment;\" and adds, \"under these circumstances, it may seem one of the strangest caprices of fortune, that the empire which he founded in India, should have been called both in the country, and by foreigners, the empire of the Moguls; thus taking its name from a race that he detested.\" Seeing, however, that Baber was of Mogul origin, it would not appear a very \"strange caprice of fortune\" that the empire which he founded, should be called after a people from whom he was descended; but Erskine proceeds to account for it as follows:\u2014\"This arose not so much from his being a descendant of Chengis Khan, as from his being a foreigner from the north; and from the age of Chengis Khan downwards, all Tartars and Persians, in the loose colloquial language of India, seem to have been denominated Moguls.\" And Bernier, who visited India towards the close of the reign of Shahjehan, mentions that most in his service \"were people drawn from every country, mostly Persians, and in less number Arabians and Turks; for it is sufficient ground for being called a Mogul, to be a foreigner of a fair complexion, and professing Mahomedanism; circumstances which cause the distinction from the Indians, who are swarthy and pagans, and also from the Christians of Europe, who are called Franjas.\"\nDELHI.\n\nexceed 200,000 cavalry, and about 20,000 infantry and artillery-men. Bernier, who considered the army which Prince Dara, the son of Shahjehan, led against his brother Aurungzebe, as inferior to none ever mustered in India, estimates it at 100,000 cavalry, 20,000 infantry, and eighty pieces of artillery. The treasure accumulated by Shahjehan amounted, according to report, to six millions sterling, exclusive of jewels and gorgeous furniture of much greater value. The harem of Akbar was maintained on a scale of great magnificence. In the Ayeen Akbery it is described as \"an inclosure of such immense extent as to contain a separate room for every one of the women, whose number exceeds 5,000.\" By the conquests of the successors of Akbar, especially Aurungzebe, the extent and revenues of the empire were vastly increased, though perhaps with little, if any, advance of its actual power. The empire of Aurungzebe is stated to have been divided into twenty-one soubahs, assessed in the aggregate at 87,724,615L.\n\nBut this prosperity was only the prelude to rapid and total decay. The chiefs of Rajpootana became alienated from the throne of Delhi; a spirit of insurrection and fierce hostility pervaded the Sikhs, Mahrattas, and others; and, after the death of Aurungzebe, in 1707, his feeble successors became the helpless instruments of conflicting chiefs and parties. His grandson, Jehandar Shah, was, in 1713, deposed and strangled, after a reign of one year. Farokshir, the next in succession, met the same fate in 1719; in the course of which year two other occupants of the musnud passed thence to the grave. Rennell observes, that, \"in eleven years from the death of Aurungzebe, five princes of his line who had mounted the throne, and six others who had been competitors for it, had been disposed of; and the degraded state of the regal authority during this period had introduced an incurable anarchy, and a disposition in all the governors of provinces to shake off their\n\n* Abulfasal considers this great establishment as a proof of his sovereign's political wisdom. \"There is in general great inconvenience arising from a number of women; but his majesty, out of the abundance of his wisdom and prudence, has made it subservient to public advantage; for by contracting marriages with the daughters of the princes of Hindoostan and of other countries, he secures himself from insurrections at home, and forms powerful alliances abroad.\"\n\n1 Bernier, i. 299.\n2 Id. i. 60.\n3 Id. i. 306.\n4 Fraser, Hist. of Nadir Shah, 35.\n5 Tod, Annals of Rajasthan, i. 417.\n6 As.

From this time,\" he continues, \"affairs declined very rapidly.\" During the reign of Mohammed Shah, who ascended the throne in 1719, the dismemberment of the empire to a vast extent took place, through the encroachments of the Mahrattas, who, in 1737, under their leader Bajee Rao, pushed their attacks to the gates of Delhi; and the usurpation of Asof Jah, the Nizam-ool-mulk,* and viceroy of the Deccan, who made himself the virtually independent* ruler of the spacious realm now known as the territory of the Nizam. These disruptions, and the consequent weakening of the empire, tempted the invasion of Nadir Shah, the barbarous usurper of the sovereignty of Persia, who, having overrun the greater part of Afghanistan, crossed\u2020 the Indus at Attok, and marched upon Delhi. He was met, on the 13th February, 1739, at Kurnaul, by the Mogul army, which there experienced so decisive a defeat, that the invader occupied Delhi without farther resistance. Whilst engaged there in levying a heavy contribution, the Persian troops were rashly attacked by the populace, who destroyed several hundreds of them. Nadir attempted to restore order, but in vain; and being placed personally in some danger, he gave orders for a general military execution, which were acted upon with terrible fidelity. The massacre of the inhabitants continued from the dawn of light till the day was far advanced.\u2021 Fifty-eight days after his arrival, Nadir marched from Delhi homewards, bearing with him plunder, the amount of which could\u2021 not be much less than twenty millions sterling. At\n\n* Administrator of the empire.\n\n\u2020 As might be expected, the numbers killed on each side in this dreadful affair are very imperfectly ascertained, and very variously stated. Mendez,\u00b9 an eyewitness, gives 400 Persians and 100,000 Indians as the amount. Mirza Zuman, quoted by Fraser,\u00b2 states the numbers at 400 Persians and 120,000 Indians; or, according to other versions, 150,000. Otter\u00b3 reports 2,500 Persians and 225,000 Indians; Hanway,\u2074 400 Persians and 110,000 Indians. Soignes,\u2075 a Romish missionary, swells the numbers to 5,000 or 6,000 Persians, and a million Indians. Scott\u2076 gives the number of the former at 1,000, the latter at only 8,000; which seems as incredibly small as the numbers in the account last quoted appear exaggerated. The statement of Mahadikhan, in the Nadir-namah, is considered by Elphinstone\u2077 the most probable; and he makes the number of Indians put to the sword, 80,000.\n\n\u2021 There is as much diversity in the authorities respecting the extent of\nthe same time Mohammed Shah ceded\\(^5\\) to Persia the greater part of the province of Tatta, commensurate with the tract now called Sinde, and all the possessions of the Mogul empire west of the Indus. In other quarters, the empire was shorn of extensive provinces. Bengal disclaimed\\(^6\\) the sovereignty of the Mogul, and the Rohilla Patans, taking advantage of the disasters inflicted by Nadir, and the confusion subsequently caused by the invasions of the Dooranee, assumed independence\\(^7\\) in 1749, in the tract extending from Oude to the Jumna. Safdar-jang, the nawaub of Oude, made himself independent in that province. The Mahrattas, in addition to the encroachments in the Deccan, which have been already noticed, made themselves masters of Guzerat, Berar, and Orissa, and Malwa\\(^8\\) was divided between them and several native princes and zemindars; Ajmeer reverted to the Rajpoots, and the Punjab was, in 1752, ceded to Ahmed\\(^9\\) Shah Dooranee, of Kabul. Ahmed Shah, the Great Mogul, who had succeeded to the shattered sovereignty of Delhi on the death of his father, in 1748, was, in 1754, deposed and blinded. In his reign, the dismemberment of the empire may be regarded as completed, and on the accession of his successor, Alumghir II., nothing remained\\(^1\\) to the house of Tamerlane but the spoiled and decayed metropolis, which itself, in 1756, was taken by Ahmed\\(^2\\) Shah Dooranee, and, in 1758, by the Mahrattas.\\(^3\\) The last-named people, now aiming at the entire empire of Hindostan, collected, under the command of Sedashio Bhaq, their forces,\n\nbooty as in regard to the numbers of the slain. According to Elphinstone,\\(^1\\) \"it comprised a treasure in money, amounting, by the lowest computation, to eight or nine millions sterling, besides several millions in gold and silver plate, valuable furniture, and rich stuffs of every description; and this does not include jewels, which were inestimable.\" The total amount appropriated by Nadir, according to Fraser,\\(^2\\) was 70 crore, or 70,000,000l.\\(^3\\) Rennell\\(^4\\) makes it 62,000,000l. The money alone which Nadir took, is estimated by Hanway at 37,500,000l.; by Fraser\\(^4\\) at 30 crore, or 30,000,000l.; and in the Nadir-namah\\(^5\\) at 15 crore, or 15,000,000l. Amongst the miscellaneous plunder was the famous peacock throne, valued by the jeweller Tavernier at 6,000,000l. The plunder carried away by the officers and soldiers is estimated by Fraser at 10 crore, and the charges of the Persian army, and the damage inflicted by them, at 20 crore; making a total loss to the sovereign and people of Delhi of 100 crore, or 100,000,000l.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rennell, lxix.\n\\(^2\\) Elphinstone, ii. 625.\n\\(^3\\) Elphinstone, ii. 629, 632.\n\\(^4\\) p. 221.\n\\(^5\\) p. lxviii.\n\\(^6\\) p. 230.\n\\(^7\\) Elphinstone, ii. 596.\nestimated at about 70,000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry, and were, in January, 1761, encountered at Paniput by Ahmed Shah Dooranee, at the head of a confederate Mahomedan army of nearly equal number, when the Mahrattas were totally routed, their commander and the greater part of their army being cut to pieces. Shah Alum, whose right to the titular sovereignty accrued on the assassination of Alamgir, in 1759, was at that time a fugitive in Bengal, and his son Jewan Bukht, a youth of thirteen years of age, was, under the name of Shahjehan, recognised shah of Delhi, by Ahmed Shah Dooranee. Shah Alum, however, assumed the title of Padshah, and coming into collision with the forces of the English East-India Company, was defeated by them at Patna, in February, 1760. Subsequently he threw himself on the clemency of the British, and in 1765, obtaining from the East-India Company an assignment of territory, yielding a revenue of 260,000l., he made over to them the Dewanny of the provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa, which was virtually a grant of the provinces themselves. In 1771, Shah Alum, determined at all hazards to try his fate at Delhi, left Allahabad, the residence assigned him by the British authorities, and made over to the Mahrattas the territory and revenue allotted to him by the arrangement of 1765. But the proposed transfer was of no avail to the Mahrattas, as the British authorities, regarding the alienation of the districts as an abandonment, did not hesitate to resume the grants; and the short-sighted emperor, having entered Delhi on the 25th December, 1771, found himself there the destitute and helpless captive of the Mahratta chief Madhaji Scindia, who became the real sovereign of the capital and the adjoining territory. The power of Scindia being weakened by various causes, Ghulam Kadir, a Rohilla chief, son of Zabitah Khan, and grandson of Najib-ood-dowla, who had made a great figure in the affairs of Delhi during the time of Ahmed Shah Dooranee and Alamgir, gained a footing there; but his conduct to Shah Alum was more intolerable than even that of the Mahrattas, and the Shah wrote to Scindia, urging him to march to his deliverance. The correspondence having been treacherously disclosed to Ghulam Kadir, he forcibly entered the palace of the captive emperor, struck out his\n\n* Called Bedar Bukht, in the Memoirs of Amir Khan.\neyes with a dagger, seized his scanty treasures, and subjected\nthe females of his family to plunder and outrage. This dreadful\nconsummation of the emperor's adversity took place in 1788,\nwhen he was about sixty-five years of age, and had nominally\nreigned about twenty-nine years. Ghulam Kadir shortly after\nfell into the hands of Scindia, who put him to death with\nostentatious* cruelty. Under the Mahrattas, Shah Alum\nlong suffered neglect and abject poverty; nor was his condition\nimproved when the command\u00b9 of Delhi was intrusted by that\npower to Perron, the French adventurer; for though a sum\nof about a hundred thousand\u00b2 pounds sterling was nominally\nallotted for the annual expenditure of the royal household, not\nmuch more than a fifth\u2020 of that sum was ever actually dis-\nbursed. On the 8th September, 1803, the British army,\nunder General Lake, marching from Allygurh on Delhi, came\nin front of a superior Mahratta force, under command of\nLouis Bourquien, a French adventurer, and advantageously\nposted on the left bank of the Jumna to defend the approaches\nto the city. There the army of the Mahrattas was utterly\nrouted\u00b3 with great slaughter, a vast number of their men\nbeing driven into the Jumna and drowned, and all their\nartillery and stores falling into the hands of the British.\nDelhi thereupon, without farther resistance, admitted the con-\nquering army, and the Mogul emperor was taken under the\nprotection of the East-India Company, an allowance being\nassigned for his support.

The account given in the Memoirs of\nAmir Khan is, that he was \"tied by the foot to the foot of an elephant,\nand so he was beaten to pieces, and separated limb from limb, and suffered\na miserable death.\"\n\n\u2020 The Appendix, quoted in the text, says (p. 88), \"There are fifty sons\nand daughters of the emperor; the monthly stipend allowed to each of\nthe princes of the imperial family by the French and Mahrattas, did not\nexceed fifteen rupees, or about two pounds sterling. The monthly sums\ndisbursed by Monsieur Drugeon, who had charge of the person of the\nemperor, were, for the expenses of his majesty, royal family, dependants,\nestablishment, &c. &c., about 17,000 rupees (about 2,125l. sterling).\"\n\n\u00b9 Appendix to\nNotes relative to\nthe late Transac-\ntions in the Mah-\nratta Empire, 82.\n\u00b2 Thorn, 162.\n\u00b3 Thorn, 113.\nRao Scindia, the latter \"renounces all claims upon his majesty Shah Alum, and engages, on his part, to interfere no further in the affairs of his majesty.\" In October, 1804, the Mahratta chief Jeswunt Rao Holkar, having under his command about 70,000 men, with 130 pieces of cannon, laid siege to Delhi; the British force in which consisted of but two battalions and four companies of native infantry, two corps of irregular horse, two corps of irregular infantry, and a corps of matchlock-men. Most of the irregular troops deserted, yet Lieut.-Colonel Burn, in command of the garrison, took measures for maintaining, with his very inadequate force, the whole line of defences, though nine miles in circuit, and in a very ruinous state. The operations of Holkar were materially crippled by a sortie, in which the guns of his breaching-battery were rendered unserviceable, and after an ineffectual attempt at escalade, he drew off his army with such haste, that three mines, laid for the destruction of some bastions, were left unexploded. General Lake, whose approach caused the siege to be so precipitately raised, reached the city three days afterwards. The unfortunate Shah Alum died in 1806, at the age of eighty-six, and was succeeded by his son Akbar, who, dying in 1837, at the age of eighty, was succeeded by the present Padshah, Mohammed Bahadur.\n\nThe prestige of the name of the Mogul throughout India, long after the nominal ruler of Delhi had ceased to possess any real power, was remarkable, and rendered expedient a jealousy on the subject which the real condition of the latter state would not otherwise have warranted. The feelings of deference for the throne of Delhi extended to provinces very remote from the seat of its former grandeur, and to Hindoos not less than to Mahomedans. It was in fact universal. In 1813, the Tamburetty, or princess of Travancore, a Hindoo state situate near Cape Comorin, and never subject to Delhi, applied for a dress of investiture from the Padshah, for her infant son, though he was under the guardianship of the British government. It was with some difficulty that her desire was overcome; and though compelled to acquiesce in the decision of the British authorities, the applicant was by no means satisfied that the coveted investiture was unnecessary or improper. The universal respect entertained for the Mogul\nDELHI.\n\nauthority, and even for its semblance (of which the above is an instance) has rendered it necessary that the British government should discountenance as far as possible any assumption of regal or imperial dignity on the part of the representative of the great Mahomedan power which once was paramount in India, and the head of the house of Baber is fast subsiding into the station of a subject. The British government long since disallowed his pretensions to coin money, to establish weights and measures, to confer title or command, except within the limit of his own household. The pride of the Mogul is said to have been wounded by Lord Hastings, when governor-general, having remained seated during an interview. So early, however, as 1805, the presentation of nuzzur or offerings by British functionaries, was subjected to check; the Marquis of Hastings and Lord Amherst restrained it still further, and a later governor-general, Lord Ellenborough, forbade it altogether, and substituted a pecuniary equivalent, which, after some hesitation, was accepted by the king. More recently, an arrangement has been made with the heir-apparent, by which the palace* of Delhi is to be given up to the British government, the king and the members of the royal family over whom he is to continue to exercise jurisdiction (the number of such persons being considerably abridged) removing to another residence.\n\nThe formal title of the Delhi sovereign is Padshah or Badshah; and so late as 1806 he has been styled by Hindoos raja\u2020 of Indrapreatha. The official name of the city, in the\n\n* The royal palace of Delhi is to be regarded by the courts of law as an independent foreign territory. The king and the heir-apparent are exempted in their persons from all civil and criminal process; and the sons and brothers of the reigning, or any former prince, are exempted from civil, but not from criminal process.\n\n\u2020 On a coin struck by Holkar the Mahratta, \"by permission of the raja of Indrapreatha (the king of Delhi), the emperor of the world.\" Heber does not seem to have been aware that the city was named from its founder Shahjehan, as he observes, \"The official name of the present city is Shahjehanpoor, 'city of the king of the world.'\" It is not, however, probable that the court would use the Hindee termination poor instead of the Persian abad. Besides, in Richardson's Dictionary, by Wilkins, it is distinctly styled \"Shahjehanabad, the city of Shahjehan, the Great Mogul's capital;\" and also in the same work, in the copy of the legend on a splendid and unique coin of 200 mohurs, struck by Shahjehan.\ndocuments of the Padshah, is Shahjehanabad. The number of persons connected with the Padshah, by consanguinity more or less remote, is considerable; and from the extension of their families and the withholding by the king of their due share of the allowances granted by the British government, they are said to have been sometimes subject to great distress. The king received compensation for the discontinuance of emoluments derived from nuzzur, or offerings made in recognition of his superiority, but still did not escape the pressure of debt. It was proposed a few years since, to increase the royal allowances (previously about twelve lacs per annum), by the addition of three lacs, on condition of due provision being made for claims of dependants. His majesty did not at first think fit to accept the boon on the condition annexed to it, but subsequently altered his determination.

It is about a mile and a quarter S. of Malown, and is situate between that fortress and Surujgarh, both held by the Goorkhas at the beginning of April, 1815, when General Ochterlony advanced to attempt their reduction. With a view to cut off the communication between those forts, and to facilitate the formation of a breaching-battery, a British detachment, under Colonel Thompson, took possession of Deontul, where it was furiously attacked by about 2,000 Goorkhas, who, however, were utterly defeated, with the loss of 700 men, including their commander. After this defeat the Goorkhas offered no further serious opposition, and soon after concluded the convention for ceding the hill states to the East-India Company.

Lat. 30\u00b0 25', long. 71\u00b0 3'.\n\nDERA DEEN PUNAH.\u2014A town of the Derajat, on the right or west bank of the Indus. It was nearly destroyed by the great earthquake of 1819 and the overwhelming floods which at the same time descended from the Suliman Mountains.

The crops in the vicinity are principally cotton, grain of various kinds, indigo, and some sugar and opium. Lat. 31\u00b0 9', long. 70\u00b0 50'.\n\nDERA GHAZEE KHAN.\u2014The most southern and also the most important of the three towns which contribute to give to the Derajat its name. It is a large, populous, and commercial place, situate in a low alluvial tract, four miles from the right or west bank of the Indus, and contains numerous ruins of mosques, and of the extensive and well-constructed residences of the former Durani governors and officers. It carries on considerable transit-trade; an advantage attributable to its being situate at the point where one of the great routes from Eastern India and the Punjab into Beloochistan and Khorasan intersects the great route from north to south into Sinde. The bazaar contains 1,600 shops, the inmates of 530 of which are engaged in weaving and selling cloth. It is in other respects well supplied with goods, but ill-built and dirty. Some manufactures are carried on here in silk, cotton, and mixed fabrics of silk and cotton, called loongees, intended for scarfs and waistbands. Coarse cutlery is also manufactured to a considerable extent.\n\nThe surrounding country is very unhealthy during the hot season, but remarkably fertile, being well irrigated, and producing grain, fruits in abundance and of fine quality, sugar, cotton, and much indigo, in which a considerable traffic is driven. Both the transit and the direct carrying-trade are conducted almost exclusively by the Lohani Afghans, who are at once a pastoral and a mercantile tribe.\nDER.\n\nDera Ghazee Khan, in consequence of its advantageous position, has been recommended by Burnes and others as the best site for a great annual fair, to be held under the protection of the British government, commanding, as it does, such important routes and the navigation of the Indus north and south. It was a dera, post, or camp of Ghazee Khan, who, about three centuries ago, figured as an adventurer here, and being wrested from the Durani empire by the Sikhs, fell to the British upon the conquest of the Punjaub, in 1849. Lat. 30\u00b0 4', long. 70\u00b0 54'.\n\nDERA ISMAEL KHAN.\u2014A considerable town of the Derajat, built a short distance from the right or west bank of the Indus, to replace the former town, which, having been situate only a hundred yards from the river, was, a few years ago, swept away by it so completely that not a vestige was left. The town is well laid out, but is ill built of unburnt brick, and in general has an air of desolation, though in spring there is much business, it being then crowded by the Afghans of the Lohani tribe, who purchase great quantities of goods to transport by their caravans for the supply of Afghanistan and Central Asia. The most important article of commerce is white cotton cloth, of which two millions of yards are yearly sold here, and eighteen millions of yards taken through, in transit from Hindostan to the north and west of this place. There is also a considerable trade, by way of the Indus, southward, in grain and salt, from Kala Bagh. The position of Dera Ismael Khan is important, being situate on one of the great routes from the north to Sinde and the Southern Punjab, and also in the vicinity of the ferry at Kaharee, one of the most frequented over the Indus. There is another ferry over that river three miles to the eastward of the town. About three centuries ago, there was here a dera, post, or encampment of Ismael Khan, an adventurer in this country; and hence the name which the town bears. It was wrested from the Durani empire by the Sikhs, and became incorporated with the British dominions upon the conquest of the Punjaub in 1849. Its population is stated to be 8,000.

It is situate on the left bank of the Indus, where the stream, previously straitened in its passage through the mountains, expands on entering into the plain; and hence probably the name of Derbend, which signifies the place of a dam or strait.\u00b2 In its neighbourhood, in 1827, Sheer Singh, the Sikh commander, defeated Saiyid Ahmed, the fanatic Afghan, who had excited a religious war against the Sikhs.

The former flows from the east, the latter from the north, and at the vertex of the right angle formed by their junction the town is situate. According to the graphic description of Raper, \"The contrast of the two streams is very remarkable; the former (Bhageerettee) runs down a steep declivity with a rapid force, roaring and foaming over large stones and fragments placed in its bed, while the placid Aluknunda, flowing with a smooth unruffled surface, gently winds round the point.\" The banks of both rivers are composed of hard black rock; but while those of the Aluknunda are almost perpendicular, to the height of eighty or a hundred feet, those of the Bhageerettee are shelving and expanded. The Aluknunda, the deeper and more considerable river, is, at the season of low water, 142 feet in breadth, and in the rainy season rises forty-six or forty-seven feet. It abounds with fish of the rohu\u2020 species, four or five feet in length, regarded sacred, and so tame as to take food from the hand. The Bhageerettee is, at the season of low water, 112 feet in breadth, and rises forty feet in the rainy season. Each river is crossed by a jhula or rope bridge. The united stream having a breadth of eighty yards, receives below the confluence the name of the Ganges. The town is built 100 feet above the water, on the scarp of a mountain rising\n\n---\n\n* From Deva, \"a divinity,\" and Prayag, \"a confluence of rivers.\"\n\n\u2020 Called by Raper, Cyprinus denticulatus; apparently the Cirrhinus Rohita of McClelland.\n\n---\n\n1 As Res. xi. 488 \u2014 Raper, Survey of the Ganges.\n\n2 As.

A flight of steps cut in the rock gives access to the town from the water's edge.\n\nThe houses are arranged so as to form two rows of unequal length, joined at a right angle, the longer row facing the Bhageerettee, the other the Aluknunda. They are generally two stories high, built of large stones, cemented with lime mortar, and having sloping roofs, covered with shingles. In the upper part of the town stands a temple, sacred to Rama-chandra.* It is situate on a terrace from twenty to thirty yards square, and six feet high, and is built of large blocks of cut stone piled on each other, without cement, so as to form a pyramid, bulging in the middle, and decreasing rapidly towards the summit, which is surmounted by a white cupola; and over all is a square sloping roof, composed of plates of copper, crowned above with a golden ball and spire. The entrance is on the western side, in a portico, from the roof of which are hung bells of various sizes. Under the shelter thus provided, the worshippers perform their devotions. The image of Rama-chandra, about six feet high, carved in black stone, but painted red, except the face, is seated opposite the door, and under the eastern part of the cupola. Before the idol, and opposite the portico, is the brazen image of a Garuda.\u2020 One knee is bent on the ground, and his hands are joined in the attitude of prayer. The whole height of the building is between seventy and eighty feet. Under the terrace is a temple, sacred to Mahadeva. The only information which the Brahmins professed to be able to vouch for, when questioned respecting the age or founders of the building, was, that it had stood for 10,000 years, which is certainly a very respectable degree of antiquity. It is a peculiarly sacred place of pilgrimage for the superstitious Hindoos, being one of the five principal Prayags or confluences mentioned in the Shastras. The grand rite is ablution, which takes place at the confluence, in three kundas or basins, excavated in the rock, at a level a little lower than\n\n* An incarnation of Vishu.*\n\u2020 Wilford describes the Garuda with his usual recondite learning:\u2014\u201cGaruda, or the eagle, upon whom Vishnu and Jupiter are represented riding. Garuda is represented generally like an eagle; but, in his compound character (somewhat like the cherub), he is represented like a young man, with countenance, wings, and talons of the eagle.\u201d \u201cGaruda is called the Vahan (literally the vehicle) of Vishnu or Jupiter.\u201d\n\n1 As.

The names of the pilgrims are registered on their making sufficient disbursements to the officiating Brahmins, on account of dues and oblations. The annual revenue of these functionaries, exclusive of such contributions, does not exceed 120l., derived from twenty-five villages, granted for the purpose by the rajah of Gurwhal; and notwithstanding the holy celebrity of the place, the Brahmins are compelled to eke out a subsistence by the practice of trade. The temple, as well as the rest of the town, was much shattered by an earthquake in 1803, but subsequently repaired by Brahmins sent thither for the purpose by Daulat Rao Sindia. The town contains between 200 and 250 houses, inhabited principally by Brahmins from the Deccan. The heat is sometimes very great, exceeding 100\u00b0 at noon in the shade.

Their dynasty is recorded to have ruled over Malwa for 1,058\u2075 years. In more recent times, we find one of the ancestors of the present rajahs, a military commander in the service\u2076 of Sevajee, the founder of the Mahratta power, and his two sons, Tukajee and Jewajee, accompanying Bajee Rao, subsequently Peishwa, when appointed soubahdar\u2077 of Malwa in 1735, and receiving from him Dewas and some other possessions. During the distracted state of Central India which followed, the dominions of the rajahs of Dewas were incessantly overrun\u2078 by Mahrattas, Pin-darries, and other freebooters, their towns and villages sacked, and themselves and families reduced to misery; but since the British protection has been extended to them, their dominions have been restored to order and prosperity. The treaty under which this was granted, is dated in 1818.\u2079 By its engagements, the rajahs are bound to maintain a contingent force, to be at the disposal of the British government. This force, since the date of the treaty, has been considerably increased, and now consists of 400 infantry, forming part of the Malwa united contingent. The military force of the state consists of 175 horse and 500 foot. The rajahs have agreed to act by a union\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.\n\u00b2 Parliamentary Return, April, 1851.\n\u00b3 Journ. Roy.

Its length probably does not exceed five or six miles, its breadth may be taken to be nearly equal, and its area about twenty-five square miles. Its centre is in lat. 31\u00b0 12', long. 77\u00b0 8'. It is throughout a collection of summits of considerable height, with intervening valleys, and is drained northward by a stream* which discharges itself into the Sutlej, and southward and westward by a few insignificant streams, feeders of the small river Gumbur. The general elevation of this small territory probably exceeds 4,000 feet. The left bank of the Sutlej at Soomee, to the north, and much lower than the greater part of the country, is 2,283 feet\u00b2 above the sea. It is one of the Barah Thakoorai,\u00b3 or \"twelve lordships,\" which were in the tract between the Sutlej and the Tonse, until the divisions were obliterated by the Gorkha invasion. Dhamee belongs to a petty Hindoo rana or prince, who received it from the British government on the expulsion of the Gorkhas in 1815.

Westward of the fort is the town, surrounded by a weak wall of loose stones, and to the south-west of the town is a large tank. In 1818, after the defeat and flight of Apa Sahib, rajah of Nagpore, or of Berar, it was invested by a British force under General Marshall, who, having to no purpose offered the garrison 10,000 rupees in payment of arrears, on condition of immediate evacuation, opened batteries against the place with such effect, that in six hours it was yielded unconditionally.

The town is nearly three and a quarter miles in length and half a mile in breadth. It is surrounded by a mud wall, and has many striking buildings, especially two large mosques, built of red stone, but fast falling to decay. Water is abundant, being supplied from two small and eight large tanks. There is a fort, built of red stone, situate outside the city, on an eminence rising forty feet above the plain. The rampart, from thirty to thirty-five feet high, has twenty-four round and two square towers, on the larger of which last the rajah's palace is, built of stone. The gate of the fort is in the western face, and is defended by octagonal towers. The city is represented to have once contained 20,000 houses, an amount which would assign it a population of about 100,000.\n\nAt present its numbers fall short of that amount to an extent\nDHAR.\n\nwhich would make comparison ludicrous. An English and vernacular school has been established here by the present ruler of Dhar.\n\nThe raj or petty state of Dhar contains an area of about 1,070 square miles, and has much fertile ground, producing abundant crops of rice, wheat, millet, maize, pulse, oil-plants, sugar-cane, tobacco, opium, ginger, cotton, hemp, turmeric, esculent vegetables, and pulse. The annual revenue is estimated at 475,000 rupees, or 47,500l.; the population at 104,860. The rajah maintains a military force, which, inclusive of the police, amounts to about 1,100 men; and a contribution is made by the state of 8,000 rupees per annum in aid of the support of the Malwa Bheel corps. The rajah is a Puar or Pramar Rajpoot, of a very ancient family, but owes his present dignity to the gift of the Peishwa, about a century ago. Towards the close of the last and in the early part of the present century, the state of Dhar was miserably devastated by the troops of Scindia Holkar and other freebooters; and when the British troops, in 1817, advanced to this part of India, the limits of the state were greatly contracted, and its revenue did not exceed 35,000 rupees. By the intervention of the British government, various districts of which Dhar had been dispossessed were restored to the rajah, and Bairseeah, which had been conquered from the Pindarries, was granted to him, subject to the condition that the British government should retain possession of it for a limited period, for the purpose of liquidating a loan; after which period that government was to have the option of holding it, or of letting it, for the benefit of the Dhar state, which was thenceforth to be entitled to the revenue and produce. This arrangement was made in 1819. In 1821, a new engagement was concluded, by which the district of Bairseeah was ceded to the British government from the expiration of the period of retention before stipulated for; in consideration of which, and of the tribute of Alle Mohun also ceded, a specified annual payment was to be made.\n\nThe bargain, however, was found a losing one, and Bairseeah was in a few years given back to Dhar; but the home authorities regarding this as an illiberal proceeding towards an ally who had no power to resist, annulled the surrender, and directed the engagement of 1821 to be adhered to. Possession\nof Bairseeah was consequently resumed, and the stipulated payment restored. By the treaty of 1819 the British government undertook to protect the state of Dhar, in return for which the rajah ceded the tributes of Banswarra and Doongerpore, entered into the usual engagements of subordinate co-operation and friendly alliance, and bound himself, at all times when required, to furnish troops in proportion to his ability.\n\nElevation of the town above the sea 1,908 feet.

Still some of the summits have a great elevation; Lebong, on the eastern frontier, being 18,942 feet above the sea. The elevation of the Dharma pass, on the northern frontier, leading to Hiundes, is probably about 15,000. The whole habitable portion consists of the narrow, and generally very rugged valleys\u00b2 down which flow the river Dhoul and its feeders; the rest consists of rocks or mountains, covered with perpetual snow. The boundaries of a tract so ill peopled and difficult to explore are not very precisely defined, but they may be considered as lying between lat. 30\u00b0 5'\u201430\u00b0 30', long. 80\u00b0 25'\u201480\u00b0 45', and as inclosing an area of about 400 square miles. When Traill drew up his account, it had twenty-four villages, containing 342 houses, and consequently, if six persons be allowed to each house, the population may be estimated at 2,052, or between four and five to the square mile. They are called Bhotias, and are of the Mongolian or Tartar variety of the human race. \"In their personal appearance,\" observes Traill,\u00b3 \"the Bhotias are perfect Tartars, and exceed the natives of this province in size\n\n* A place of meeting for the neighbourhood, and where justice is administered, and alms are distributed.

In the course of this commerce, grain, the produce of Lower Kumaon, and cotton broadcloths, hardware, sugar, and other goods, brought from Hindoostan, are sent to Hiundes, and exchanged for culinary salt, tincal or borax, gold dust, and wool; besides some others of less importance.\n\nDHARMDA.\u2014A town in the British district of Midnapoor, presidency of Bengal, six miles S.W. of Midnapoor.

Previously to 1836, the collectorate of Dharwar consisted of eighteen talooks, stretching nearly 300 miles from north to south. In that year the ten northern talooks were formed into a new district, denominated the Collectorate of Belgaum, those in the south remaining under the control of the collector of Dharwar,\u00b2 and forming the district now distinguished by that name. As at present constituted, the district of Dharwar is bounded on the north by the Belgaum collectorate; on the east by the territory of the Nizam and the British collectorate of Bellary; on the south by the Mysore dominions; and on the west by the Madras territory and the Belgaum collectorate. It extends from lat. 14\u00b0 16' to 15\u00b0 50', and from long. 74\u00b0 50' to 76\u00b0. Its greatest length from north to south is 105 miles; its greatest breadth from east to west 77 miles. The area is 3,837 square\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.\nJourn. As. Soc. Beng. 1837, p. 178\n\u2014Mackecon,\nJourn. of Wade's Voy. down Sutlej.\n\u00b2 Garden, Tab. of Routes, 172, 224.\nE.I.C.

A small portion has an inclination to the south-west, as indicated by the direction taken by the streams, which, flowing towards that point, fall into the Kali Nadi, a river making its way through a deep valley in the Ghauts to the Arabian Sea or North Indian Ocean. The Tumbudra,* rising in the territory of Mysore, on the eastern declivity of the Ghauts, and in lat. $13^\\circ 12'$, long. $75^\\circ 12'$, flows for ninety-five miles to the southern boundary of the collectorate, which it touches in lat. $14^\\circ 20'$, long. $75^\\circ 41'$; thence continuing its course circuitously, but generally towards the north-east, for sixty-five miles, it forms the boundary between this collectorate and that of Bellary, and finally leaves Dharwar in lat. $15^\\circ 9'$, long. $76^\\circ$. In lat. $14^\\circ 56'$, long. $75^\\circ 46'$, this river receives on the left side the Wurda, rising on the eastern declivity of the Ghauts, and flowing north-easterly for a distance of fifty miles. In many parts of the collectorate of Dharwar the soil is fertile, and well suited to the growth of cotton. Various attempts have been made by the Bombay government for the introduction of the New Orleans species. Previous experiments having failed, the last was commenced in 1842, and has been attended with success. In that year twenty-five acres only were sown with American cotton. It was cultivated by the ryots in the midst of their own native products, and much in the same manner, excepting that the American cotton was sown some weeks earlier. The return of the newly-introduced species being found much larger than that of the indigenous article, and the quality considered superior, the cultivation spread with extraordinary rapidity. Small experimental farms were established by government; but these, except in so far as they tended to provide a supply of seed, seem to have been of no value, as it is stated by competent authority, that the cultivation of the ryots themselves excelled that of the farms. These establishments were consequently soon relinquished, and the breadth of land devoted to the cultivation of American cotton continued, without artificial aid, to extend, until, in five years only from the date of the successful experiment, it had reached 25,000 acres; and it is stated that, but for the occurrence of\n\n* According to the trigonometrical survey as engraved by Walker.\nunfavourable weather at the proper time for sowing, it would have amounted to 60,000 acres. The superiority of the New Orleans cotton over the indigenous species is now generally recognised in Dharwar. The principal marts are Hooblee, Havery, Narragoorda, Sircy, Noolgoond, and Balgapoor. Their distances vary from 80 to 130 miles from the Madras port of Coompta, to which a good road for wheeled carriages has been constructed, and where the cotton is shipped for Bombay. The population of this collectorate is for the most part Canarese, the Mahrattas, though once the ruling race, not amounting now to more than a tenth of the whole. Canarese, the language of the people, was therefore, in 1836, judiciously substituted for Mahratta in the transaction of official business. The population has been returned at 754,385, the relative density being 196 to the square mile.\n\nDharwar, the principal town, and Hooblee, as well as others of note, are described under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement. The principal roads are the following:\u2014One leading from south-east to north-west, from the town of Dharwar to Belgaum, and thence eastward, through Sawunt Warree, to the port of Vingorla; another, from southeast to north-west, from the town of Dharwar to Kolapore; and a third, from Dharwar to Hooblee, and thence to Wuddeguttee, on the Canara frontier of the Madras territory, there to join the road constructed by the Madras government for facilitating the inland trade between Dharwar and the port of Coompta.\n\nAt the date of the latest returns, the number of government vernacular schools in this district amounted to fourteen, and that of the pupils to about 900. There is also a government English school in the town of Dharwar, containing forty pupils.\n\nThe territory comprised within the collectorate of Dharwar appears at the earliest recorded period to have formed part of the Brahminical realm of Vijayanagar, and on its overthrow, by the defeat of its rajah at Talikot, in 1565, by a Mussulman confederation, to have become part of the kingdom of Beejapoor. In 1675 it seems to have been overrun and partially conquered by Sevajee, the notorious founder of the Mahratta sway, becoming thereby subject to the power of the rajah of\nDHARWAR.\n\nSattara, and subsequently to that of the Peishwa. In 1776 the province was overrun by Hyder Ali, the usurping sultan of Mysore. The capture by that chief, in 1778, of the fort and town of Dharwar, and their recapture, in 1791, by a British force acting in co-operation with the Mahrattas, are noticed in the article on the town. On the overthrow of the Peishwa in 1818, Dharwar was incorporated with the territory of the East-India Company.\n\nDHARWAR, the principal place of the British collectorate of the same name, in the presidency of Bombay, is situate close to the frontier which divides the Bombay territory from the Madras collectorate of Canara. Duff describing its condition, says, \"The defences of this fortress are principally of mud, and though irregular and now greatly decayed, were then [in 1790] very strong. It is situated in a plain, having an outer and an inner ditch from twenty-five to thirty feet wide, and nearly as many feet deep. Adjoining to the fort on the south side, and outflanking it to the eastward, is a town or pettah, defended by a low mud wall and a ditch of no strength.\"\n\nIn 1837, this place was the scene of religious disputes between the Brahmins and Lingayets, which rose to such a height as to render necessary the interference of authority. The principle upon which the British government have acted in such matters, is to allow to the members of every religious persuasion the undisturbed exercise of their own rites and ceremonies so long as they are unattended with danger to the public peace. The Vrayasunthole procession at Dharwar, in the judgment of the Bombay government, was incompatible with this necessary condition, in consequence of the mutual animosity subsisting between the Lingayets and Brahmins, and it was determined that it should not again take place.\n\nTwo of the government vernacular schools, the one Mahratta and the other Canarese, are established in this town; as is also an English school, containing about forty pupils.\n\nIn 1778, Dharwar was taken from the Mahrattas by Hyder Ali, the sultan of Mysore, and in 1791 retaken by a British force auxiliary to the Mahrattas, who very little furthered the operations. On the final overthrow of the Peishwa, this place, with the other possessions of that potentate, fell to the disposal of the British government.

It lies between lat. 26\u00b0 30'\u201426\u00b0 57', long. 77\u00b0 32'\u201478\u00b0 20'; is about fifty-four miles in length from north-east to south-west, twenty-three in breadth, and has an area of 1,626 square miles. The large river Chumbul, touching on the territory at its south-west angle, forms its south-eastern boundary for about sixty miles, and subsequently flowing eastward, forms the boundary between the British district of Agra and the territory of Gwalior. The Bangunga, called in this part of its course the Ootungun,* after forming the boundary for a few miles, passes to the interior, through which it flows in a direction generally easterly for about fourteen miles, and subsequently, for twenty miles, forms the boundary between this territory and the district of Agra. In its course along the frontier, it on the right or south side, and in lat. 26\u00b0 54', long. 77\u00b0 57', receives the torrent Parbutty, flowing in a direction from south-west to north-east through this territory, which it enters from the territory of Kerowly. The surface of the country in the eastern part is generally level and sandy.\u2020\n\nThe south-western part is hilly, being overspread with low ranges of sandstone,\u2021 connected with the hills of Gwalior. Notwithstanding the poor quality of the soil, it is rendered fertile by continual irrigation, and, in due season, is covered with fine crops, interspersed with groves of mango-trees.\n\nThe principal towns of the territory\u2014Dholpore, Baree, and Rajahkera\u2014are described under their respective names in the\n\n* In Walker's Indian Atlas\u00b9 the Bangunga and Ootungun are set down as identical, which is in accordance with fact.

This must have been between the Bangunga, which runs past Jahjow, and the Ootungun, which is distant from it 8\u00bd miles, on the road towards Agra.\" Hunter seems here to have mistaken the Khari Nuddee for the Ootungun.\nDHOLPORE.\n\nalphabetical arrangement. If the population be assumed at the rate of that of the surrounding British districts, it will amount to 550,000. The revenue is estimated at 700,000 rupees, or 70,000l. per annum.\n\nThe principal route through the country is from north to south, from Agra to Gwalior, by the town of Dhlopore.\n\nThe chief, who is styled Rana, and the majority of his subjects, are Jauts, who, according to the Brahminical notions respecting caste, are a spurious offset of the Rajpoots. Probably the first of the Rana's ancestors who rose into notice was the chief of Gohud,* who, about the middle of the eighteenth century, acquired territory by the favour of the Peishwa Bajee Rao, but on the defeat of the Mahrattas at Paneeput, rebelled, and about 1761 made himself master of Gwalior and the adjacent country. The political relations between the Rana and the East-India Company commenced in 1779, when the respective parties formed a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, in which it was stipulated, that when peace should be concluded between the Company and the Mahrattas, the Rana should be included in it, and that his then present possessions, and such acquisitions made during the war as it should be agreed to leave in his hands, were to be guaranteed to him, together with the fort of Gwalior, recognised as of old belonging to the family of the Rana,\u2020 if at the time of the peace he should be in possession of it. In 1780, that fort having been taken by a British detachment under Major Popham, was made over to the Rana, from whom subsequently it was wrested by Scindia, in 1784, the British government having abandoned the Rana, on the ground that he had been guilty of treachery. In 1801, however, that government engaged to establish the Rana in his hereditary dominions of Gohud, and certain districts enumerated in the treaty of that date; but difficulties arising in the way of carrying out this engagement,\n\n* Hamilton makes the following statement: \"The Rana's ancestors were zamindars of the village, and by caste Jauts, of the Bamrowly tribe. Bheem Singh, the Rana prior to the battle of Paniput in 1761, acquired Gwalior, but was afterwards obliged to yield it to the Mahrattas.\"\n\n\u2020 According, however, to Gladwin, the Rana had never been able to get possession of Gwalior, until the British took it, and made it over to him.\n\n1 Hodges, Travels in India, 136.\n2 Rennell, Mem. of Map of Hindoo-stan, 234.\n3 Duff, Hist. of Mahrattas, ii. 420.\n4 Sutherland, 138.\n5 Thorn, Memoir of War in India, 246.\n6 Sutherland, 139.\n7 Gazetteer, i. 585.\n8 In note on As.

Hence the chief is sometimes, though rather inaccurately, styled the Rana of Dholpore Baree. The military force maintained by the Rana, inclusive of the quotas of the jaghiredars, consists of about 2,000 men.\n\nDHOLPORE.\u2014The principal place of the small raj or territory of the same name, a town on the route from Agra to Gwalior, 34\u00bd miles S. of the former, 37 N. of the latter. It is situate a mile from the north-west or left bank of the Chumbul, here crossed by ferry, but fordable at Keytri, four miles higher up the stream, though the channel is there three-quarters of a mile wide. The river during the rainy season rushes down with a vast volume of water, overflowing the right bank, but restrained by the left, which is high and steep, so that the fort situate on it has a striking appearance. Here are some fine antique mosques and mausoleums. One of the mosques is stated to have been built by Shah Jahan in 1634; and some other of the buildings here are of still earlier date. They \"are all elaborately built, and worked out of the fine freestone of the country; and the trellis-work upon some of their stone screens is still as beautiful as when first made.\" Dholpore is an ancient place, and was founded at a very remote period by a prince called Daula, from whom the name has been derived. Such, at least, is the traditional report of the natives, as recorded by Tieffenthaler. Baber repeatedly mentions the place, and states that it surrendered to him in 1526. He adds, that, seeing a huge solid mass of red stone there, he ordered it to be hewn into a house, if practicable; but finding that it had not sufficient depth for that purpose, he caused the top of the rock to be levelled, and a tank excavated therein. He also caused a palace, a mosque, a pleasure-ground, and a well to be formed near it. At present there is encamping-ground here, and a large bungalow or lodge for travellers, built by a former British resident, and purchased by the Rana for its present\n\n* Dholpur of Tassin; Dholpoor of Brigge's Index.\nDHO.\n\npurpose.* Distant N.W. from Calcutta, by Etawa, 793 miles.

Webb\u00b3 describes it, at twenty-five miles\nfrom its source, as \"violent, turbid, in continued rapids from\nsix to twenty-five feet; bed rocky, average breadth from\nsixteen to twenty yards;\" and adds, that after rain \"the\nwater is so foul and turbid as to be unfit for drinking.\" The\nroad to Hiundes by the Neo Dhoora Pass proceeds up the\ncourse of the river, passing by means of spar bridges from side\nto side, according to the exigencies of the path, which some-\ntimes winds along the faces of the nearly perpendicular preci-\npices; yet, during the season when the passes are open, this\ndifficult track is crowded by innumerable laden goats and\nsheep, bearing grain and other merchandise from the lower\ndistricts to Hiundes.\n\nDhour Boonga, in the British district of Gurhwal,\nlieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a town\non the right bank of the river Sanee, 20 miles S. of Sireenuggur.\nLat. 29\u00b0 57', long. 78\u00b0 52'.\n\nDhourera.\u2014A town in the native state of Oude, 80\nmiles N. from Lucknow, and 73 miles E. from Shahjehanpoor.\nLat. 28\u00b0, long. 81\u00b0 9'.\n\nDhowlutnugur, in the Jetch Doobab division of the\nPunjab, a town situated on the route from Wazeerabad to\nBhimbur, 20 miles N. of the former.

It has a nearly quadrangular ground-plan, and is inclosed with a rampart\u00b2 two miles in circuit, made of large hewn stones, and having on the interior side a beautiful and useful colonnade of the same material. Within this inclosure is a large tank of strong masonry, access to the water of which is by means of a grand flight of stairs extending quite round it, and on the well-constructed stone embankment are numerous Brahminical temples. The total circuit of the tank is considerable, it being supplied with water not only from the periodical rains, but also by means of an aqueduct of stone, conveying it from the country outside. Viewed from the country, Dhubbooe has a noble aspect, its ramparts being surmounted by fifty-two towers, besides one at each angle, of superior dimensions to the rest. In each face of the quadrangular rampart is a double gate, with a spacious area between, surrounded by a corridor and guard-rooms. The portal on the eastern side is called the \"gate of diamonds,\" and with the temple adjoining, forms a very noble and elegant specimen of Hindoo architecture. It extends 320 feet in length, with proportionate height, and the upper part of the building is supported by rows of figures of elephants sculptured in stone, and represented as richly caparisoned. All parts of these superb buildings are embellished with a profusion of sculptures, representing warriors in combat on horses, on foot, or on elephants, in a very superior style of execution; and there are besides sculptures innumerable of lions, camels, birds, snakes, and various other animals. A considerable part of the ramparts and other buildings have been destroyed by the hand of time and by invading Mussulmans. According to native tradition, these magnificent structures, including the fortifications, tank, and temples, cost upwards of ten millions sterling. The vast quantity of massive hewn stone used in them, is calculated to excite the greater surprise, as not the smallest pebble is to be met with in this part of Guzerat. The place swarms with monkeys, which are supported, encouraged, and protected by the inhabitants, though very mischievous and troublesome.

In clear weather it may be discerned from sea at a distance of from twenty-four to twenty-seven miles, and as the contiguous land is low, the headland, which is bluff, and has a small ancient fort on the summit, appears at a distance like an island. \"The shore here is bold and safe to approach, there being seven and eight fathoms at one and two miles' distance, twenty and twenty-two fathoms at two or two and a half leagues' distance, and at fifteen leagues' distance abreast the mount you lose soundings. This is the narrowest part of the channel between the main and Lacadiva Islands, the distance being twenty-seven leagues between Elicalpeni Bank and Mount Dilly. Abreast of this headland there is frequently a drain of current to the southward, with a short confused swell, the effect of brisk north-westers, which greatly prevail here.\" Elevation above the sea 804 feet.

It is bounded on the\nDINAGEPORE.\n\nnorth-east by the native state of Bhotan; on the east by that of Coosh Behar and the British district of Rungpore; on the south by those of Bograh, Rajeshaye, and Malda; on the west by Purnea; and on the north by the British territory of Darjeeling. It lies between lat. $24^\\circ 53'$\u2014$26^\\circ 38'$, long. $88^\\circ 2'$\u2014$89^\\circ 16'$; is 120 miles in length from north to south, and 75 in breadth. The area is 3,820 square miles. It is a very flat country, the only eminences being mere undulations, not rising more than 100 feet above the ordinary level of the surface. There is, however, a general, though very gradual, slope of the country from north to south, as indicated by the flow of the rivers in that direction. The principal of these is the Teesta, which, flowing southerly from the mountains of Sikkim, touches on the district in lat. $24^\\circ 58'$, and flowing south-east for thirty-five miles, divaricates into two streams, one, called the Attree,* flowing south, the other flowing south-east into Coosh Behar, and retaining the name of Teesta. The Attree, with the exception of a few miles, during which it flows through the district of Rungpore, holds a southerly course through Dinagepore for 100 miles, during the latter portion of which it forms the boundary between this district and that of Bograh, and finally crosses the southern boundary into the British district of Rajeshaye. It communicates with other streams having courses in some measure parallel to its own, and sends from its right side a large offset, called the Purnabada, which, flowing south-westerly by the city of Dinagepore, passes the southern boundary of the district into the British district of Malda, and falls into the Mahanunda. During the rainy season, the Attree is navigable for craft of twenty tons, throughout the larger portion of its course in this district, but near its upper end no loaded vessels can ascend after the middle of November. In the southern part, vessels of forty tons frequent it from the middle of June till the middle of October. In the dry season, it admits of boats carrying only forty or fifty maunds (two to two and a half tons). The Jamuna, or Jabuna, a considerable stream, holds a course nearly parallel to the Attree, but on an average about fifteen miles to the east of it. The water is remarkably pure, and the river is navigable during the rainy season throughout its course in this district, a distance of about sixty miles, for craft varying from twenty\n\n* The Atreyi of Buchanan.1\n\n1 Parliamentary Return, April, 1861.\n2 Buchanan, Survey of Eastern India, ii. 683.\n3 Buchanan, ii. 699.\n4 Ibid. ut supra, ii. 601.\n5 Ibid. 629.\nDINAGEPORE.\n\nto twenty-five tons, according as they may ply on the lower or upper parts of the stream. With a parallel course, but still farther to the eastward, flows the river Curateea, an offset from the Attree. In its upper part, it passes through the district of Rungpore to the frontier of Dinagepore, and forms for seventy miles the boundary between these two districts, when it passes the south-eastern corner of the latter into the British district Bograh. The Tangon, rising in the northern quarter of the district, and having a course parallel in some measure to the Attree, and on an average about twenty miles west of it, flows through this district for about 140 miles, crossing the southern frontier into the British district Maldah. It in all places is available for the transmission of goods by means of rafts or very small boats, but is not generally navigable for craft of any considerable burthen. The Coolick, a considerable watercourse, unites the Tangon with an important stream termed the Nagor, which for eighty miles constitutes the boundary between Dinagepore and Purneah, and then forms a junction with the Mahananda, the united stream still forming the boundary between the two districts for twenty-five miles, and then passing into the district of Maldah. Numerous smaller streams traverse the country, communicating with the greater and with each other; the whole tract, in consequence of the propinquity of the Himalaya and the powerful influence of the monsoons, having such redundancy of moisture, that the surface is little but a reticulation of watercourses. There are no proper lakes, but in the rainy season the rivers in some places form considerable sheets of water; and there are many marshes, originating in copious springs, and in the rainy season so increased as to become temporary lakes. The deserted channels of rivers also retain water in places, which are denominated jhils or ponds. The winds are more variable here than is common in India; but by far the most prevalent among them is that from the east, which ushers in the periodical rains, commencing about 12th June, and ending about the 14th of October. In spring there are strong west winds, producing great heat, and sometimes storms, accompanied by thunder, rain, and hail. Hailstones are occasionally of such size as to cause death to human beings and cattle struck by them, and to break through the roofs of houses. A hailstone has been found measuring six inches in\n\n6 Buchanan, II. 607.\nDINAGEPORE.\n\ndiameter. From the termination of the rainy season in October, to the setting in of the hot winds in the beginning of April, the weather is comparatively cool, and to Europeans pleasant, though even they sometimes find the cold in mid-winter such as to render woollen clothing and fires necessary to comfort.\n\nThe wild elephant and rhinoceros can scarcely be said to be known here. Two elephants are stated to have made their appearance in the forests of Peruya, accompanied by a rhinoceros, having probably wandered from Nepaul. There are tigers and leopards, but in no great numbers; and as these animals find abundant food in the jungle, they seldom injure human beings. Some assert that lions have occasionally been observed. The jackal, wolf, hy\u00e6na, fox, and wild dog are common; bears are few in number, frequenting the recesses of ruined towns; otters are so numerous that their skins might become an article of commerce. Wild buffaloes abound, and commit great havoc; their strength and ferocity being such as to deter the natives from attacking them. Peafowl are numerous, and the jhils and marshes are overrun with wild geese, wild ducks, and some other aquatic birds. Fish swarm to an incredible degree in all the waters, and form the principal animal food of the people; crocodiles are common, but not very dangerous to human beings. Venomous serpents are numerous, and many persons perish from their bites. Bees abound, and wax is an article of commerce, though not of great importance.\n\nForests and jungles were forty years ago estimated to over-spread about 220 square miles of the district. Their best produce appears to be bamboos of various kinds, many of them serving several important uses; sal (Shorea robusta), Ficus indica and Ficus religiosa, the cocoanut-palm, which, however, does not bring its fruit to perfection; khajur palm (elate), valuable for its juice yielding saccharine matter when inspissated, and when fermented an alcoholic beverage much used; the Palmira palm, valuable for similar purposes; and some other trees of the same character. There are besides, the nim (Melia azadirachta), simul (Bombax heptaphyllum), the deodar, botanically denominated Uvaria longifolia, stated by Buchanan to be a very useless tree, and consequently widely\ndiffering from the noble deodar, or Cedrus deodar, of the Himalaya. To the above are to be added various kinds of mimosa. Other trees of importance are the jujube (Zizyphus jujuba) and jak (Artocarpus integrifolia), a species of breadfruit. Rice is the principal grain of the district, and in many parts two crops are yearly obtained from the same ground. Wheat and barley are raised, but in no great quantities; meruya (Cynosurus corocanus) and various kinds of millet are also articles of cultivation. Peas, and various others kinds of pulse, as well as oil-seeds, are extensively raised. The insipid fare of the bulk of the people peculiarly requiring seasoning, many products are grown for this purpose: ginger, turmeric, capsicum, coriander, anise, and pepper. Of esculent vegetables, there are the potato, sweet potato, begun or egg-plant, esculent arum radish, plantain (Musa paradisiaca), various cucurbitaceous plants, and many others unknown in Europe; most of the vegetables of that quarter of the world, however, thriving here during the cool season. A small quantity of cotton is cultivated: it is generally of poor quality, and is retained for home use. There is, however, a kind, denominated son, of superior quality, produced in the eastern part, having a strong staple, well suited for sailcloth and cordage. The sugar-cane flourishes, having a stem of considerable thickness, and twelve or fourteen feet high. The canes are planted in the beginning of spring, and gathered towards the close of the succeeding winter. The juice is prepared merely by boiling down, either into a thick syrup or a hard dry cake, and in these states sent to market. The tobacco grown is not sufficient for the consumption of the district. Betel (Piper betle) and hemp (Cannabis sativa), yielding an intoxicating extract, are grown to considerable extent. The cultivation of indigo has been tried, but does not appear to prosper. Silk is produced in considerable quantity, the worms being fed on the foliage either of the mulberry or of the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis).\n\nThe domestic animals are kine, buffaloes, sheep, horses of a very diminutive and wretched breed, swine, goats, which are very numerous, and of which 300,000, it has been stated, are annually sacrificed, their flesh forming feasts for the worshippers. Wretched dogs, owned by no one, swarm in the towns and villages. Cats, which animals, however, are less\nnumerous, are equally neglected. Geese, ducks, gallinaceous poultry, and pigeons, are the domesticated birds.\n\nThe principal manufacturing processes are dyeing, the weaving of cotton and silk, mat-making, paper-making, book-binding, tanning, distilling, oil-pressing, carpentry, smithery, and the fabrication of pottery.\n\nThe principal exports are grain, oil, ghee or clarified butter, cotton cloths, silk, and coarse silk fabrics, turmeric, and ginger; the imports, salt, metals, manufactured and otherwise, cotton fabrics of various kinds, blankets and other woollens, and spices.\n\nThe majority of the people are wretchedly lodged in huts, the sides of which are of strong coarse matting, the roofs of thatch, the framework of strong bamboos. Persons in easier circumstances have dwellings of mud, and latterly a few of the more wealthy have built houses of brick, in imitation of those of the Europeans. Mosques are numerous in the district. They are generally small, and of simple construction; the form, a cube, covered with a dome, or a parallelopiped covered with several. The most numerous Hindoo places of worship are denominated sthans, and are merely heaps or square terraces of earth placed under trees, having a stone or a rude image of clay painted as an object of worship. A step in advance of this is the mondop, having walls painted with rude, frightful imagery, on subjects drawn from the Hiadoo mythology. Such a building, surmounted by a pyramid or a dome, is a still higher effort of devotional zeal, and is reserved for the more revered objects of worship. The most complex and expensive is called a novorotno, or \"building of nine ornaments,\" having a roof of two stages, with an octagonal ground-plan, a central pyramid, and eight others, one at each external angle. Such buildings are costly, as they are cased with expensive tiles elaborately carved. That at Gopalganj is said to have cost 20,000l.\n\nThe population is stated to be 1,200,000, which, compared with the area, affords an average of 314 to the square mile. The Mussulmans have been estimated to exceed the Hindoos in the proportion of seven to three. Among both, marriages take place excessively early, the conjugal union being ordinarily completed before the female has reached the close of her\nDINAGEPORE.\n\nthirteenth year,\\(^6\\) or the male that of his sixteenth. The effects of these premature marriages are said to be manifested in the physical and intellectual deterioration of the population, and the small increase of their numbers. The inhabitants\\(^7\\) of Dinagepore are represented by Buchanan as a puny, weak race, and far from having numerous families. They are, moreover, said to be generally short-lived, being cut off in great numbers by fevers and dysentery. The prevalence of these affections does not appear to arise from want of food. Polygamy is very prevalent, especially among the Brahminists. Widows rarely burned themselves with the bodies of their husbands, even when that horrible practice was permitted by law, and not more than one or two instances occurred annually. Only a few Brahmins of superior rank are versed in Sanscrit. Much more extensive is the knowledge of the Prakrit, a dialect\\(^8\\) corrupted from the Sanscrit, which has supplied most of the words, the syntax and inflexions having sprung from the ordinary tongue of the district. The common people are acquainted only with Bengalee, which appears to be the indigenous language of this country.\n\nThe number of towns is very small in proportion to the extent and population of the district, the great majority of the people residing in dispersed hamlets. The chief towns\u2014Dinagepore, the capital, Hemtabad, Raegang, Damdahah, and Ghonaghat\u2014are noticed under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThere are few routes through this district. They are\u2014\n\n1. From west to east, from Purneah, through the town of Dinagepore, to Rungpore; 2. from south to north, from Berhampore, through the town of Dinagepore, to Darjeling; 3. from southwest to north-east, from Maldah to the town of Dinagepore.\n\nLegends respecting the primeval state of the tract comprised in this district abound in the works relating to the early mythology of India; but the commencement of authentic history may be placed at the beginning of the thirteenth century, when Raja Lokhymon or Lakshmanyah was expelled\\(^9\\) from his dominions by Muhammad Bakhtyar, one of the generals of Kutb-uddin, emperor of Delhi. When Fakhruddin, in 1388,\\(^1\\) proclaimed himself independent sovereign of Bengal, he appears to have made himself master of Dinagepore at the\n\n---\n\n\\(^6\\) Buchanan, ii. 689.\n\n\\(^7\\) Id. ii. 689.\n\n\\(^8\\) Id. ii. 707.\n\n\\(^9\\) As.

Eventually it was, in 1538, reduced, with the remainder of Bengal, by Shir Shah, the renowned Afghan, who soon after established himself in the sovereignty of Delhi, from which he had expelled Humayon. After the death of Shir Shah, it was subdued in 1584 by Akbar, the son of Humayon, and appears to have remained a district of the empire of Delhi until the time nearly of its dissolution. In 1765, it was conveyed to the East-India Company by the grant of Shah Alum.\n\nDINAGEPORE.\u2014The principal place of the British district of the same name, a town on the route from Purneah to Rungpore, 85 miles E. of the former, and 43 W. of the latter. It is situate on the river Purnabada. Through the exertions of the British authorities, it is now clean and well watched, which is understood to present a favourable contrast to its former state. There is no public building deserving any consideration, the spacious residence of the rajah having for many years been in a state of ruin, and the ditch and rampart with which it was inclosed being nearly obliterated. There are no Brahminical temples worth notice, and but one mosque, even that being small, and of no architectural pretensions. The public offices of the civil establishment are large, but ill built, and totally devoid of elegance. That establishment consists of a civil and sessions judge, a principal sudder aumeen, a collector, a magistrate, an assistant to the magistrate and collector, an assistant surgeon. About eleven native moonsiffs are also attached to it. The population has been estimated at from 25,000 to 30,000 persons. Dinagepore is distant N. from Berhampore 142 miles, N. from Calcutta 261. Lat. 25\u00b0 34', long. 88\u00b0 38'.\n\nDINAPOOR,\u2020 in the British district of Patna, presidency of Bengal, a town on the right or south bank of the Ganges. It is an important military station, and remarkable for the fine barracks built by government for the accommodation of the troops. The barracks for the accommodation of the European soldiers are comprised within a magnificent and elegant\n\n* Dinajpur of Tassin. Buchanan observes, that the word means \"the abode of beggars.\"\n\u2020 Danapur of Tassin; Dinapur, Dinapoor, or Dinapore, of the British writers.

Many of the officers have built commodious lodges in the vicinity, and the grounds about them are neatly and tastefully laid out. There are also extensive and very handsome barracks for the native troops. The church is spacious and handsome, and the various houses scattered in market-places within the boundaries of the cantonment, and subject to military authority, were stated in 1807 to amount to 3,226; so that if five persons be allowed to each, the population should be estimated at 16,130, exclusive of military. The markets are well supplied, especially with articles suited to European taste. Distant E. from Benares, by Ghazeepore, 145 miles, W. from Patna 10, N.W. from Calcutta 411.

It is built on a gentle declivity, and is in length from north to south 987 yards, and in breadth from east to west 927. The streets are wide, the houses well built, and the bazars plentifully supplied with all the necessaries of life. The number of houses a few years ago was stated to be 1,833, and that of the inhabitants (exclusive of the troops) 6,550. The military lines, situate at the north-west corner of the town, are well drained, and always dry and clean. The Court of Justice and collector's lodge are about a quarter of a mile from the town; and between them and the town are the lodges of the officers, surrounded by groves and gardens, inclosed with hedges of euphorbium and aloes. The water is in general good, but the population\nDIN.\n\ngive a preference for drinking, to that obtained from the Brahmins' Baoli, a large public well at the north of the town. Excellent water is also found in a reservoir situate at the bottom of the rock, and replenished by the rains. The fort\\(^3\\) is situate on a wedge-shaped mass of gneiss 400 feet in length and 300 in breadth, perfectly bare of vegetation, with the exception of a few patches of scanty soil about the summit, in which some stunted trees and shrubs grow. The ascent is on the eastern side by a flight of stone steps, the other sides being nearly perpendicular. Near the summit there is a well of great depth, erroneously supposed by the natives to be unfathomable. The water from it is excellent. Dindigul is the principal place of a subdivision of the same name, forming part of the British district of Madura. Elevation of the town above the sea 700 feet, of the rock 980.

It has very splendid views,\u2014on the north, of the Chur mountain; on the south, of the valley of the Julal river. Fraser,\\(^2\\) who thought it the largest place in Sir Moor except Nahun, the capital, describes it as consisting of well-built flat-roofed houses, arranged in rows on the ledges of the solid limestone rock forming the mountain.

It is strongly fortified, according to the notions of native powers, and with reference to their practical skill in the arts of defence; but its safety principally lies in the difficulty of access to it, the road lying through a parched desert totally devoid of water; so that a besieging army must draw its supply from a distance of fifteen miles. At the time of Atkinson's visit,\u00b2 it contained the treasure of the late nawaub Bhawl Khan, vaguely estimated at 700,000l. Here also was his zenana, and thither he retired for relaxation from the fatigues of business, or for security when threatened with invasion.

It is situate at the eastern extremity of an island extending in a direction from east to west about seven miles, and having a breadth varying from a mile and a half to two miles. \"Off the point on which the town stands, and which projects to the eastward, there is a rocky ledge, extending upwards of a quarter of a mile farther in the same direction, and protecting to the southward the bay formed by the main coast opposite. The bay or harbour is further protected by two small banks, one a quarter and the other three-quarters of a mile to the eastward of the rocky ledge.\" The general depth of the anchorage is three and four fathoms, and formerly on the east side there was sufficient for a 74-gun ship; but the depth of water is considered to have decreased latterly. The channel between the island of Diu and the mainland is navigable only for fishing-boats and other small craft, the western entrance, which is defended by a fort, having four or five feet of water on the bar when lowest. The water is brackish, except that preserved from the rainy season. Vegetables and other provisions are plentiful, being brought from the mainland, the soil of the island itself being little productive. The town is well fortified, being surrounded by a wall strengthened with towers at regular intervals. Notwithstanding the excellence of the harbour for ships of\nmoderate draught, there is but little traffic. Under orders from the Portuguese government in Europe, the trade in slaves formerly carried on in this island has been discontinued. Diu Head, two miles to the westward of the west end of Diu island, has on its east side a small harbour, where vessels might lie sheltered from the westerly winds in from two to three and a half fathoms. It lies in lat. $20^\\circ 42'$, long. $70^\\circ 52'$. The town of Diu is distant from Ahmedabad, S.W., 192 miles; Baroda, S.W., 182; Bombay, N.W., 170.

It is bounded on the north and east by Mewar or Oodeypore; on the south-east by Banswarra; and on the south and south-west by the Myhee Caunta district of the province of Guzerat. Its length from east to west is forty miles, its breadth from north to south thirty-five, and it contains an area of about one thousand square miles.

Its chief is descended from a branch of the Odeypore family, whose ancestors became, at an early period, dependent on the emperor of Delhi, and so continued until subjugated by the Mahrattas, from whose oppressive yoke the prince and his territory were rescued by the British. The treaty\u00b9 by which the British connection was established, was concluded in 1818; and the terms and conditions are substantially the same with those of the treaty concluded about the same time with the chief of Banswarra, and which are described in the article upon that state.\n\nThe population of Dongurpoor, estimated at 100 to the square mile, amounts to 100,000. The revenue is stated at 109,000\u00b2 rupees, or 10,900l. per annum. Under the treaty above referred to, the British government is entitled to tribute not exceeding in any case three-eighths of the actual revenue. The armed force of the state is represented to consist of 125 cavalry and 200 infantry, with a police establishment of 100 men; making a total of 425.

In 1827, the Rawul consented to divest himself of the exercise of the government, and to surrender it to his adopted son Dulput Singh; but the latter was reclaimed by his grandfather, the rajah of Pertaubghur, being his only surviving descendant, and on whose death he was allowed to succeed to the raj of Pertaubghur, still remaining regent of Dongurpoor. On the death of the rawul of the last-named state, however, the question arose whether Dulput Singh should succeed to the dignity by virtue of the adoption. It appeared that the thakoors or nobles of Dongurpoor were greatly averse to the union of the two principalities, and it was therefore agreed that Dulput Singh should adopt a son from among the kindred of the late rawul, who should be placed on the Dongurpoor guddee, Dulput Singh continuing regent during the minority. It seems, however, to have been thought, that in a legal point of view, the reclamation of Dulput Singh by his own family did not annul the rights which had accrued to him by adoption; but for the sake of preserving the peace of the country, he consented to compromise his claim in the manner above described.\n\nDONGURPOOR, in Rajpootana, a town, the residence of the rawul of the petty state of the same name, lies on the route from Neemuch to Deesa, and is 139 miles S.W. of the former, and 121 S.E. of the latter.

The fortifications of the town or pettah, which, however, are utterly contemptible, communicate on the east side with those of the stupendous fortress. This stronghold consists of a conical hill, or rather vast rock of granite, scarped all round to a complete perpendicular, for a height of about 150 feet from the base. The summit of this conical rock is a small platform, not many feet in width, on which is mounted a brass twenty-four pounder; and there is also a staff, on which flies the flag of the Nizam. The upper and conical part of the hill is not accessible by any stairs or passage externally visible, but at the base of the scarp an opening gives admission into a low narrow passage, hewn in the solid stone, and leading to a large vault, excavated in the interior of the hill. From this chamber, a ramp or gallery, gradually sloping upwards, and also excavated in the solid rock, winds round in the interior. This ramp or ascending gallery, which has a height and breadth of about twelve feet, terminates above in a recess on the top of\n\n* Daulatabad of the Persian writers: Prosperity-town; from Daulat, \"prosperity,\" and Abad, \"dwelling.\"\nthe rock, about twenty feet square. At the base of the hill, throughout its whole circuit, is a ditch, passable throughout its whole extent only by one causeway, constructed of stone so narrow as to admit the passage of only two men abreast, and defended on the side towards the rock by a battlemented building. At a short distance outside the ditch is a minaret, apparently 100 feet high, said to be erected in commemoration of the first capture of this place by the Mahomedans. On the slope of the hill, and about 100 yards from the summit, is a cistern, hewn in the rock, and holding, it is conjectured, about forty hogsheads. The perpendicular height of the hill above the surrounding plain is about 500 feet. It is altogether isolated, being about 3,000 yards from the nearest hills, which are situate to the north and west.\n\nThe original name of this place was Deoghur; and it received that of Dowlutabad from the Emperor Mohammed, son of Toghluk Shah, who proposed to make it the capital\\(^2\\) of the imperial state, to the supersession of Delhi, and who sought to force the inhabitants of the latter city to fix their abode in the former. The attempt, however, was abortive. It may be added, that the present state of Dowlutabad does not exhibit any appearance of the prosperity or good fortune indicated by its name.\n\nDowlutabab is distant from Aurungabad, N.W., 10 miles; Hyderabad, N.W., 280; Bombay, N.E., 170.

It is the place of rendezvous of the Lohani and other caravans, which every spring depart westward with the annual supply of British and Indian wares for Central Asia. These Lohanis descend, with their camels and other cattle, to spend the winter in the mild climate and luxuriant pastures stretching along the western bank of the Indus, and at the same time to furnish themselves with articles suitable for supplying their customers in Afghanistan and the countries north and west of it; and they assemble\nDUR.\n\nat Durabund to muster their strength for resisting the predatory tribe infesting the roads through which they have to pass. The town of Durabund is a small ill-built place, but bearing evidence of having been more prosperous, until ruined by the predatory attacks of the Vaziris and other marauders from the west. The permanent population is scarcely 1,000. Lat. $31^\\circ 35'$, long. $70^\\circ 13'$.\n\nDURAJEE, in the delta of Sinde, a small town on the Buggaur, or great western branch of the Indus. When, about 200 years ago, this branch was navigable from the sea to the main channel of the river, Durajee and Lahorybunder, about two miles lower down, were the principal ports of Sinde, being accessible for vessels of 200 tons burthen. The Buggaur, however, has now for many years ceased to be navigable during the season of low water in the Indus, and goods landed at Durajee are, by means of camels, conveyed to Tatta overland, a distance of thirty miles. Though, during the season of low water, the Buggaur is unnavigable above Durajee, it has at all times a depth of at least twelve feet from that place downwards as far as the Pittyanee mouth of the Indus, a distance of twenty-eight miles. This easy access from the sea renders Durajee the port of Tatta and the greater part of the delta, as Kurrachee is the general haven for the upper part of Sinde. The closure of the port of Vikkur, in consequence of the great alteration which took place in the Hujamaree mouth in 1839, will probably cause an increased resort to Durajee.

Like most places in Bundelcund, it has a rocky site. It \"is surrounded by a stone wall, about thirty feet high, with its foundation on a solid rock; but it has no ditch or glacis, and is capable of little or no defence against cannon.\" Though the streets are narrow and intricate, the place has altogether a flourishing aspect, there being many good houses, the residences of the principal zemindars or landholders throughout the territory. The residence of the raja is in the town, within the walls of a garden or pleasure-ground, about\n\n* Datiya of Tassin; Datteah of Rennell; Dutteah of D'Cruz and Garden; Dattiya of Franklin.\n\n+ According to Mundy, \"a beautifully-built stone wall.\" Tieffenthaler states it to be a rough wall, in which great unshapely stones are piled over each other, without cement.\nDUTTEEAH.\n\nten acres in area, \"crossed and recrossed at right angles by numerous walks, having rows of plantain and other fruit-trees on each side, and orange, pomegranate, and other small fruit-trees to fill the space between.\" The inclosing wall, about thirty feet high, with embattled towers at each of its four corners, has, in its eastern face, a fine and large gateway; and surmounting the wall at the opposite side of the pleasure-ground is the pavilion or lodge in which the raja resides. Between the pavilion and the gateway a building rises, in the midst of a fine reservoir, of which the following description is given:\u2014\"The shaft presented an octagon of about twenty feet span, surrounded with columned cloisters, and at each angle a figure of an elephant, sculptured in stone, with uplifted proboscis, spouted water to a vast height into the air.\" Within the wall of the city is another palace, at present untenanted; and outside, and westward of the city, is a third, of great extent as well as strength, and in a fine style of architecture, but likewise deserted. The population, estimated by Sleeman at forty or fifty thousand, consists almost exclusively of votaries of Brahminism, though three or four miles from the town is a curious cluster of temples of the Jains. The Brahminical temples appear to be not much worth notice. The rocky ground around the town for two or three miles is overgrown with copse or stunted forest, abounding in game. Adjacent to the town is a jhil, or small artificial lake.\n\nThe raj or territory of which Dutteeah is the principal place, lies between lat. $25^\\circ 32'$\u2014$26^\\circ 18'$, long. $78^\\circ 15'$\u2014$78^\\circ 54'$. It is estimated to contain an area of 850 square miles, and 380 villages, with a population of 120,000. The revenue was estimated, in 1832, at 120,000l., and in 1847, at 100,000l. The raja pays no tribute. He maintains a military force, consisting of 1,000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry, and eighty artillerymen. This state was formerly part of the dominions of Oorcha, and its raja appears to be descended from Dewada Bir, who, about the end of the fourteenth century, at the head of a colony of warlike Rajpoots, invaded and conquered a considerable tract of country.* Subsequently, Dutteeah, after passing under the overwhelming domination of the Mogul empire, became\n\n* Such appears to be the purport of the account given by Captain Franklin.\n\n1 Trans. of Roy.

The ancient territories of his house are guaranteed, also protection against foreign aggression.\" The Peishwas having in 1817, by Art. XIII. of the treaty of Poona, ceded to the British government all his rights in Bundelcund, the raja of Duttecah, in acknowledgment of his zealous friendship and active co-operation, was, by treaty in 1818, rewarded by the Governor-General with a considerable addition to his territory. The last hereditary raja died in 1839, and was succeeded by a foundling whom he had adopted, and who was recognised by the British government. Duttecah is distant W. of Allahabad, by Banda, Chirkaree, and Jhansi, 260 miles; N.W. of Calcutta 755.

It is held2 by Fateh Bahadur, a notorious freebooter, who has 1,000 men under his command. In 1812, it was stormed by a British force commanded by Colonel Faithfull, and for some years was occupied by a detachment of the Company's troops, but evacuated about 1838. It was then repaired by the present occupant, who pays annually 50,000 rupees to the Oude government, and remunerates himself by widely ravaging the neighbouring country.

There is encamping-ground at the temple of Kalka, 200 yards from the village, and supplies are procurable. Here, according to Traill, are tombs substantially built of large flat tiles, the memorials of Moguls located on the spot in the course of Tamerlane's expedition into Hindustan. Lat. 29\u00b0 47', long. 79\u00b0 28'.\n\nDWARKA, or DWARIKA, called also Jigat, in the peninsula of Kattywar, province of Guzerat, a town on the western shore, in the district of Okamundel. The land towards the sea is moderately elevated, and the place is conspicuous, from the commanding appearance of the great temple of Krishna or Dwarkanath, \"the Lord of Dwaraka.\" It is the most celebrated of all the shrines raised to Krishna, and is built on an eminence rising from the seashore, and surrounded by a fortified wall (which likewise encircles the town), from which it is, however, separated by a lofty partition-wall, through which it is necessary to pass to see it to advantage. \"It may be said to consist of three parts: the munduff, or hall of congregation; the devachna, or penetralia (also termed gabra); and the sikra, or spire.\" \"The munduff is square, measuring twenty-one feet internally, and five distinct stories high. Each story is colonnaded, the lower being twenty feet in height, and of the same square form to the last, where the architraves are laid transversely to form a base for the surmounting dome, whose apex is seventy-five feet from the pavement. Four massive pillars on each face of the square form the foundation for this enormous weight; but these being inadequate to sustain it, intermediate pillars to each pair have been added, to the sacrifice of all symmetry. A colonnaded piazza surrounds the lowest story, of about ten feet in breadth, from which to the north, south, and west, portions are projected, likewise colonnaded. Each story of the munduff has an internal gallery, with a parapet of three feet in height, to prevent the incautious from falling. These parapets, divided into compartments, had been richly sculptured.\" \"The sikra or spire, constructed in the most ancient style, consists of a series of pyramids, each representing a miniature temple, and each diminishing with the contracting spire, which terminates at 140 feet from the ground. There are seven distinct stories, before this pyramidal spire greatly diminishes in diameter. Each face of each story is...\"\nDWARKA.\n\nornamented with open porches surmounted by a pediment, supported by small columns. Each of these stories internally consists of column placed upon column, whose enormous architraves increase in bulk in the decreasing ratio of the superimposed mass; and although the majority at the summit are actually broken by their own weight, yet they are retained in their position by the aggregate unity.\" \"The entire fabric, whose internal dimensions are seventy-eight feet by sixty-six, is built from the rock, which is a sandstone of various degrees of texture, forming the substratum of the island. It has a greenish hue, either from its native bed, or from imbibing the saline atmosphere, which, when a strong light shines upon it, gives the mass a vitreous transparent lustre.\" Joined by a colonnade to this temple is a smaller one, dedicated to Deoki, the mother of Krishna; and at the opposite angle of the great temple is another, still smaller, dedicated to Krishna, under his title of Madhu Rae, or the \"Prince the intoxicator.\" The Gumti, a small rivulet which flows by the group, is considered especially sacred, but it is so shallow that it does not reach the ankle. The site of the temple was once insulated; but the sea having thrown up a sandbank across the channel, this sacred spot is now connected with the mainland. About eighteen miles north of Dwarika is Amrara, supposed to be Muldwarka or ancient Dwarka, where Krishna met his death. Others, however, consider Mahadoopoor, ninety-five miles south-eastward of Dwarka, to have been contiguous to Mool Dwarka, which, according to tradition, was swept away by the sea. At this spot, native report declares that a bird annually springs from the foam of the sea, and having perched and sported on the top of the temple, falls down and dies, and from its plumage the Brahmins prognosticate whether the year will be rainy or otherwise. Dwarka is distant from Ahmedabad, S.W., 235 miles; Baroda, W., 270.

It is the principal place of a pergunnah containing 122 khalsa villages, or such as belong to government, and forty granted as jagheers or fiefs. At the commencement of the present century, the district was wrested from Bhopal by the Mahrattas; but being ceded in 1818, with several other possessions, by the Peishwa to the British government, it was with four other pergunnahs granted to the nawaub of Bhopal in reward of his zeal and fidelity.

It is situate in the eastern part of the district of Bureng, and has four or five\nEDG\u2014EDU.\n\norifices, from the principal of which the spring rises with such force as to form what may be termed a mound of water, a foot and half high, and twelve feet in diameter. Vigne, with much probability, supposes it to be the efflux of that portion of the water of the river Bureng which sinks into the ground about ten miles to the south-east. If, however, this opinion be correct, the sunken stream must receive large additions from springs in its subterraneous course, as the volume of water discharged at Echibul far exceeds that which disappears in the bed of the Bureng. According to Vigne, the water is not very good for drinking. Bernier, on the contrary, who describes this vast fountain under the name of Achiaval, states the water to be excellent (admirablement bonne); he adds, that it is so cold as to be almost insupportable to the touch. At the time of his visit (1665), it was surrounded by a superb pleasure-ground, belonging to Aurungzebe, having been made by order of his grandfather, Jehangir; but all is now in utter ruin.

The road in this part of the route is good; the country cultivated, and studded with small villages. Lat. 27\u00b0 7', long. 78\u00b0 35'.\n\nEDUR.\u2014The principal Rajpoot state of the Myhee Caunts, in the province of Guzerat, tributary to the Guicowar, but under the political superintendence of the government of Bombay. This petty state was founded by Anund Sing and Raee Sing, sons of the celebrated Ajeet Sing, rajah of Joudpore. The districts were assigned to them by their elder brother, the viceroy of Guzerat, under the Moguls; and the\n\n---\n\n1 Pol. Disp. to Bombay, dated 21 Jan. 1840.\nEDUR.\n\nbrothers, accompanied by several chiefs and 5,000 followers, took possession of their territory about the year 1724.\n\nThe revenues of the state, including those of the recently acquired possessions of Ahmednuggur, and of the feudatories of both districts, were estimated in 1847 at 23,434l.; of which the rajah's share was 15,000l., subject to the deduction, on account of tribute to the Guicowar, of 3,295l.\n\nThe political relations of the British government with this state originated in 1820, under an arrangement with the Guicowar, by which it was stipulated that his troops should evacuate the province; and the British government thereupon guaranteed the payment of his dues free of all expense.\n\nThe districts of Ahmednuggur, already noticed, were formerly comprised within the state of Edur, but were bestowed, about sixty years ago, by the ruling prince, upon his second son, Sugram Sing. The late rajah of Ahmednuggur, Tukht Sing, having, however, been elected to the vacant throne of Joudpore, his possessions in the Myhee Caunta reverted to the senior branch of the family, and are now reincorporated with the state of Edur.\n\nIn 1848, the military force at the disposal of the Edur state, inclusive of the quotas of the feudal chiefs, consisted of 921 horse and foot. These troops are maintained almost entirely for purposes of police.\n\nEDUR, in the Myhee Caunta division of Guzerat, presidency of Bombay, the principal town of the district. It is a place of little importance, containing about 1,200 houses. Though encircled by hills on three sides, and defended on the fourth by a wall, the position would be one of no strength, even if the defences were completed, as it is commanded by a hill to the right, which forms part of the range. In the rear, and upon the hill, which there rises to the height of between 400 and 500 feet, is a fort, now in ruins, which in former times afforded shelter to the rajahs of Edur when driven from the town below. The hill is ascended by a steep and stony zigzag pathway, having four gateways, in tolerable repair. The eminence on the right of the town is surmounted by several Jain temples, and also by the remains of a palace, built by the former rajahs of Edur. Population 10,000.

It is situate in an elevated rocky tract, and has a small fort, on a craggy eminence. On the south there is an extensive depression, which after the rainy season becomes a great sheet of salt-water, but is at other times dry. The road in this part of the route is good, though in some places sandy. Lat. 26\u00b0 56', long. 72\u00b0 4'.\n\nEEKAIREE, or AKHERI, in the territory of Mysore, a decayed town, once the capital of a considerable and flourishing state, is situate amidst the headwaters of the Varada.* Its walls are of great extent, and form three concentric inclosures. There are besides a citadel, a great temple of Siva, and a mean building, which was the ancient palace of the extinct dynasty of Sedasiva, a personage whose wonderful adventures are preserved in Hindoo fable. Historically, he appears to have been a gauda or chief of Kilidi, in the neighbourhood of Akheri, who received a grant of some districts from Krishna Rayara, of Vijayanagar, who also bestowed on him the name of Sedasiva Nayaka, he having previously borne that of Bhadraconda. Kilidi continued the seat of his government for about twelve years afterwards, when he removed it to Akheri, which then attained the highest measure of prosperity which it ever reached, and of which most exaggerated reports are preserved by the natives. In 1645 or 1646, the government was removed\n\n* Wurda of the trigonometrical survey.\nto the neighbouring town of Bednore, and subsequently Akheri became deserted. At this time, all the buildings except the temple above mentioned are desolate, and the town without inhabitants. In 1763, Hyder Ali, the usurper of Mysore, took Bednore, then governed by the widow of the last actual chief, a profligate and shameless woman, who had caused the adopted son of her deceased husband to be murdered; and who, in conjunction with her paramour, had selected another successor to the first place in the state. All the parties were righteously subjected by Hyder to imprisonment, intended to be perpetual, but from which the chances of war subsequently relieved them. Akheri is distant from Bednore, N., 20 miles; from Seringapatam, N.W., 162.

It was formerly called Oondee, and belonged to a chief of the Ahir Rajpoots, from whom, at the close of the last century, it was taken by Doorjun Lal, a celebrated chief of the Kaichi Rajpoots, and by him denominated Bahadurghur, or \"Hero's Town.\" It became the capital of his new dominions. Subsequently, in 1803, it was wrested from him by Baptiste, one of Doulat Rao Scindia's officers. It is styled in Malcolm's Index, \"the fort of Resum or Esaugurh.\" Lat. 24\u00b0 50', long. 77\u00b0 55'.\n\nEESAH, in the British district of Etawa, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a village on the route from the cantonment of Agra to that of Etawa, and three miles N.W. of the latter.

It is something less than six miles in circumference, and is \"composed of two long hills, with a narrow valley between them. The usual landing-place is towards the south, where the valley is broadest.\" About 250 yards to the right of the landing-place is a large clumsy figure of an elephant, cut out of an insulated black rock; and from this circumstance the island (which by the natives is called Gara-pori) has derived the denomination by which it is known to Europeans. This huge figure, which is thirteen feet in length, is represented as much mutilated, and rapidly sinking into total decay, its head and neck having, in 1814, fallen from the rest of the body, which was also fast coming to the ground, an extensive fissure having taken place in the back. On advancing farther from the landing-place, the visitor comes suddenly in front of \"the grand entrance of a magnificent temple, whose huge massy columns seem to give support to the whole mountain which rises above it,\" and out of which it is hewn. The geological formation of the rock is probably basaltic.* The entrance is by a spacious front, supported by two ponderous pillars and two pilasters, forming three openings, under a thick and steep rock, overhung by brushwood; and the impression on reaching the interior is rendered very deep and solemn, by \"the long ranges of columns, that appear closing in perspective on every side; the flat roof of solid rock, that seems to be prevented from falling only by the massy pillars, whose capitals are pressed down and flattened, as if by the superincumbent weight; the darkness that obscures the interior of the temple,\n\n* According to Erskine, \"resembling porphyry.\"\n\n---\n\n1 E.I.C.

These two appendent temples do not range in a straight line with the front of the principal one, but recede considerably from it, being approached by two narrow passes in the hill, one on each side of the grand entrance, but at some distance therefrom. Each of these passes conducts also to a side-front of the grand excavation, exactly like the principal front, consisting of two huge pillars with two pilasters. These two side-fronts are precisely opposite to each other, on the east and west, the grand entrance facing the north; and the plan is regular, there being eight pillars and pilasters in a line from the northern entrance to the southern extremity, and the same number from the eastern to the western entrances. The only striking deviation from this regularity in the chief temple, is afforded by the occurrence of a small square excavation, observable on the right in passing up the temple. At the further extremity of the temple are two small excavations, facing each other on the right and left.\n\n\"The pillars, which all appear to run in straight lines, parallel to each other, and at equal distances, are crossed by other ranges running at right angles in the opposite direction; they are strong and massy, of an order remarkably well adapted to their situation and the purpose which they are to serve, and have an appearance of very considerable elegance. They are not all of the same form, but differ both in size and ornaments, though this difference also does not at first strike the eye. They rise to upwards of half their height from a square pedestal, generally about three feet five inches each way, crowned on the top by a broad bandage of the same shape; above this, but divided from it by a circular astragal and two polygonic fillets, rises a short round fluted shaft, forming about a fourth of the column, and diminishing with a curve towards the top, where a circular cincture of beads binds round it a fillet composed of an ornament resembling leaves, or rather cusps, the lower extremity of which appears below the cincture, while the superior extremity rises above, projecting and termi-\nELEPHANTA.\n\nnating gracefully in a circle of overhanging leaves or cusps. A narrow band divides this ornament from the round fluted compressed cushion, which may be regarded as the capital of the column, and as giving it its character: its fluted form coalesces beautifully with the fluted shaft below. This cushion has its circumference bound by a thin flat band or fillet, as if to retain it; and above supports a square plinth, on which rests the architrave, that slopes away on each side in scrolls, connected by a band or riband, till it meets the large transverse beam of rock, which connects the range of pillars.\"\n\nFronting and within the principal entrance, is a \"gigantic bust, representing some three-headed being, or three of the heads of some being to whom the temple may be supposed to be dedicated. Some writers have imagined that it is what they have called the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.\" Others consider it a triform representation of Siva alone. This bust, which represents the deity down to the breast, and is consequently a third-length, has been ascertained by measurement to the top of the cap of the middle head to be about eighteen feet high; and a notion of its bulk may be formed from the measurement in an horizontal curved line, embracing the three heads at the height of the eyes, and touching them, which is nearly twenty-three feet. This, though the most remarkable, is but one specimen amidst a profusion of carved figures, representing various subjects of Brahminical mythology, though it is puzzling to observe, that one at least appears to be a representative of Buddh, held in abomination by the Brahmins. The precise nature of the worship to which these temples were consecrated, seems, indeed, to be of very disputable character. There are, in different parts, three sanctuaries or shrines, which, in the opinion of a judicious writer already quoted, were devoted to the adoration of certain emblems, which, though occupying a distinguished place in Hindu mythology, are not fitted to be made the subject of popular disquisition. This opinion is deduced from the position of the emblem in question in various parts of these excavations. The writer above referred to, in explaining the grounds of his belief, observes, that the \"use made of temples by the ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as by the modern Hindus, is considerably different from that required of them by Christian\n\n6 Erakine, Trans. Lit. Soc. Bombay.\nnations. A Hindu goes alone, as an ancient Roman would have done, when he finds it convenient, offers his solitary prayers before his idol, prostrates himself in his presence, and leaves his offering: he attempts to bribe his god to prosper him in his trade, whether it be merchandise, or procuration, or theft. There is no stated regular time of teaching, no public prayers said by a priest in the name of a mixed congregation, no gathering of the people to go through a solemn service. Their great festivals are like our ideas of a fair; each man goes in his own time to the temple, makes his offering at the feet of the idol, goes out, and purchases sweetmeats. All teaching or reading of the sacred books is in private houses; or, if it is in the temple, it is in the courts of the temple; never in the consecrated edifice: the verandas or porticos near the temple are used just as any others equally convenient would be. This use, to which the courts of the temple are applied, will throw light on many passages of history and the sacred volumes of the Jews. It is evident that the temples of nations whose worship is so conducted, need not be large, like our churches, since it is not required that they should contain a multitude. In all very ancient temples, however magnificent, the part of the temple in which the deity is supposed to reside is small, surrounded by numerous buildings, in which the priests and servants of the temple reside. This seems to have been the plan of the first temple of Jerusalem; it was that of the older Grecian temples, as we may observe from the Ion of Euripides; and it is at this day that presented by the temple of Mecca. In the temples of the Hindus the great object of worship is not constantly exposed to view, nor placed in the larger outer building; it is always in an inner, small, dark apartment, usually having only one door, requiring to have lights burning before it in order to be seen, and facing the door, so as to be visible from the further side of an intervening saloon.\u201d The arrangements at Elephanta appear, as far as can be judged, to have corresponded precisely with this view, and to countenance the conjecture of the writer quoted. All, however, is wrapped in mystery. Even the period and authors of these extraordinary works are totally unknown; but there seem no good grounds for assigning them a very remote antiquity. The stone is of a mouldering nature, and many parts are far gone in decay.\nElephanta is seven miles E. of Bombay.

The town is situate on the river Purna, a tributary of the Taptee, and is of considerable size, but slenderly fortified, being only partially surrounded by a stone wall, which, though sixty feet high, is but four feet in thickness. It is surmounted by battlements, and entrance is obtained by means of a highly-ornamented gateway, built, as well as the wall, of sandstone. The palace of the nawaub has no great splendour, but in its vicinity are some handsome houses and bazars built of brick. The nawaub holds his jaghire from the Nizam, on condition of furnishing a contingent of \"a brigade\" of two battalions of infantry, 2,000 horse, and four guns.\" Of late, the relation between the feudatory and his chief has been disturbed. On the 30th May, 1850, an action took place between the troops of the nawaub of Ellichpoor and a body of those of the Nizam, sent to dispossess the former of his jaghire. Considerable loss was sustained on both sides, but the result seems to have been favourable, on the whole, to the dependent chief. Another action, fought on the 20th July, is reported to have terminated in his defeat. The nawaub, however, rallied, and on the 9th August gained a victory over the troops of his master, which was followed by another on the 28th September. The grounds of the quarrel are not very satisfactorily explained; but the total disorganization of the Nizam's financial arrangements, and the character of the measures to which his ministers have too often resorted to repair their condition, give plausibility to the statement which ascribes the difference to the aggression of the superior\nELLORA.\n\nruler. Ellichpoor forms part of the Nizam's territory which has been recently sequestrated to the British, as a provision for the maintenance of his military contingent.\n\nDistance from Hyderabad, N., 275 miles; from Madras, N.W., 600; from Bangalore, N., 570; from Nagpore, W., 100; from Bombay, N.E., 345; from Calcutta, W., 700. Lat. 21\u00b010', long. 77\u00b036'.\n\nELLORA.\u2014A decayed town in the native state of Hyderabad, or dominions of the Nizam, situate 13 miles N.W. from Aurungabad, and seven from Dowlutabad. It was formerly a place of some note, deriving its celebrity chiefly from the remarkable excavations in the neighbouring mountain, known as the temples of Ellora.\n\nAccording to Hindoo legend, the date of these temples is carried back for a period of 7,950 years,\u00b9 and their origin ascribed to Rajah Eeloo, the son of Peshfont, of Ellichpore, when 3,000 years of the Dwarpa Yoag were yet unaccomplished. The more rational account of the Mahometans states that \"the town of Ellora was built by Rajah Eel, who also excavated the temples. Eel Rajah was contemporary with Shah Momin Arif,\" who lived 950 years ago. According to Elphinstone, however, the first mention in history of these caves occurs in connection with the Princess Dewal Devi, daughter of the rajah of Guzerat, who was captured by a party who had gone from the camp of Alp Khan to visit the excavations at Ellora.\u00b2 These wonderful productions of human industry and perseverance, \"which,\" says Elphinstone,\u00b3 \"have been compared, as works of labour, to the pyramids of Egypt, and which in reality far surpass them as specimens of art,\" have drawn forth expressions of admiration from all who have studied them. \"Whether,\" says Sir Charles Malet,\u2074 \"we consider the design, or contemplate the execution of these extraordinary works, we are lost in wonder at the idea of forming a vast mountain into almost eternal mansions. The mythological symbols and figures throughout the whole leave no room to doubt their owing their existence to religious zeal,\u2014the most powerful and most universal agitator of the human mind.\"\n\nFrom the elaborate notice of a more recent observer,\u2075 Colonel Sykes, it appears that the hill containing the excava-\n\n\u00b9 As.

The sculptures at the two\nextremities are those of Dehr Warra and Parusnath, the\ninterval, somewhat exceeding a mile, being occupied by other\ncaves at irregular distances from each other, and seldom on the\nsame level. The very minute and complete account of these\ncelebrated caves which is contained in Colonel Sykes's paper,\nwill furnish the inquirer with the fullest information, and leave\nhim nothing to desire further. To this, therefore, the reader\nis referred. Ellora was ceded, in 1818, by Holcar, under the\ntreaty of Mondesoor, to the British, who transferred it to the\nNizam in 1822, by the treaty of Hyderabad. Ellora is in\nlat. 20\u00b0 2', long. 75\u00b0 13'.\n\nELLORE,* in the British district of Masulipatam, pre-\nsidency of Madras, a town with a military station, situate on\nthe Jummalair, a torrent flowing in a direction south-east from\nthe Eastern Ghats, and which, about three miles below the\ntown, falls into the Colair Lake. On the right bank of the\nriver are the barracks and the cantonment hospital; on the\nother side, the officers' houses. Communication between all\nparts of the station is practicable throughout the year, as\nthe torrent is never unfordable. The town is tolerably well\nbuilt. The sides of the streets and roads in the town and\nits vicinity are planted with rows of trees, affording very\ngrateful shade, in a place where the heat has been known to\nreach 110\u00b0 within-doors, and 120\u00b0 in tents. The nights,\nespecially during the months of April and May, are very\noppressive; and it was in the latter month, when the land\nwind blows with much violence, that the great degree of heat\nabove mentioned was observed. The official report styles\nEllore a \"populous town;\" but the number of its inhabitants\nis not stated. Distance from Bombay, S.E., 565 miles; Hyder-\nabad, E., 180; Mangalore, N.E., 500; Bellary, N.E., 300;\nBangalore, N.E., 350; Madras, N., 255; Masulipatam, N., 39;\nCalcutta, S.W., 620.

Lat. 25\u00b0 31', long. 81\u00b0 40'.\n\nEMAUM GHUR, in Sinde, was lately a strong fortress in the Thur or Great Sandy Desert, separating that country from Jessulmere. As scarcely a drop of fresh water can be had on the route from Sinde after leaving Choonkee, distant about fifty miles from Emaum Ghur, this fortress was generally considered by the ameers as an inexpugnable place of refuge. On this account, when the disputes between them and the British came to extremity, Sir Charles Napier determined at all risks to attempt its seizure. Setting out with fifty cavalry, two twenty-four-pound howitzers, drawn by camels, and three hundred and fifty European infantry, mounted on animals of the same description\u2014two on each, he, after a very trying march of three days, over a succession of steep sandhills, reached the fort, which was immediately surrendered. The captor describes it as \"exceedingly strong against any force without artillery. The walls are forty feet high, one tower is fifty feet high, and built of burned bricks. It is square, with eight round towers, surrounded by an exterior wall of fifteen feet high, lately built. There are some bomb-proof chambers.\" Twenty thousand pounds of powder were found in various places built up for concealment. These were employed in springing thirty-four mines, which reduced the fort to a mass of ruins, shapeless and irretrievable. The grain found in store had been previously distributed in rations. The British force marched back to the interior of Sinde without any loss.

It was formerly a place of importance, and had a considerable population, principally Mahomedan, as is indicated by the numerous mausoleums, surmounted by domes, around it. Here, in the end of November, 1817, the British army, commanded by the marquis of Hastings, governor-general, was encamped in its advance on Gwalior, to intimidate Scindia. It was part of the territory of Jhansi until 1843, when it was ceded by the rao of that place to the East-India Company. At the time of cession, its annual revenue was returned at 7,148 rupees.

Lat. 26\u00b0 46', long. 79\u00b0 25'.\n\nETAWAH.\u2014A British district named from its principal place, and subject to the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces. It is bounded on the north by the British districts Mynpooree and Furruckabad; on the east by the British district of Cawnpore; on the south by Bundelkund; on the south-west by the Mahratta territories of Gwalior; and on the west by the British district of Agra. It lies between lat. 26\u00b0 21'\u201427\u00b0 9', long. 78\u00b0 46'\u201479\u00b0 49', and contains an area of 1,674 square miles. It was formerly part of Cawnpore, but was formed into a separate zillah under the sanction of the home authorities in 1840. The greater part of Etawah lies in the Doab, a small strip only, forming the pergunnah of Burpoora or Janibrast, being separated from the rest by the Jumna, and lying along the right or south-western bank of that river. The Jumna touches on the north-western extremity of the district in lat. 26\u00b0 55', long. 78\u00b0 47', and, flowing in a south-easterly direction, either bounds or traverses it for 115 miles, leaving it in lat. 26\u00b0 21', long. 79\u00b0 35'. It is during the rainy season navigable throughout this part of its course for barques of heavy burthen, though even then \"the extreme tortuosity\" of its channel renders it by no means either a convenient or direct line for traffic. In the dry weather, boats can with difficulty get up higher than the junction of the Chumbul.\" This last river joins the Jumna on the right side, in lat. 26\u00b0 30', long. 79\u00b0 18', about 25 miles S.E. of the town of Etawah. So considerable is the accession of water from this source, that the Jumna below the confluence has been known to rise in twelve hours between six and seven feet, in consequence of a flood in the Chumbul. The obstacles which formerly presented themselves to the safe navigation of the Jumna in this part of its course, were principally shifting shoals and sandbanks, trunks of trees imbedded in the bottom,\nand numerous boulders, as well as fixed rocks of kankar or calcareous conglomerate. The sunken trees were removed, after a careful search, in 1833, and during the last twenty years, the clearance of other impediments has been in progress, under the directions of various officers of the engineer service. In the removal of the rocks, numerous fossil bones have been brought to light, some supposed to be human; others, those of the camel, buffalo, elephant, hippopotamus, horse, and deer; besides many of reptiles and fishes. The channel is most obstructed at Kurimkhan, ten or twelve miles below the mouth of the Chumbul. Bacon, writing before the latest improvements, mentions a long reef of limestone rock as very much impeding the navigation of the river, and rendering the passage very dangerous even to small craft; the flood through it at the dry season of the year being only sixty feet in breadth. \"Through this narrow channel,\" he observes, \"the current rushes with great violence, boiling and foaming over the submerged shoals, with a roar like that of a cataract; and here it is impossible to pass, if the wind be at all high.\" The course of the Chumbul through this district is brief. It enters at the south-western frontier, and bounds or traverses the pergunnah of Janibrast for a distance of about forty-seven miles, to the confluence with the Jumna. At the point of junction, the country on the right, or Chumbul side of the Jumna, is overspread with hills; on the left, or Doab side, it is level and unvaried, except by the steep and narrow ravines which furrow its surface towards the river. The Seyngur or Kurun runs nearly parallel to the Jumna, but ten or twelve miles more to the eastward, and falls into that river on the left side, about twenty miles south of the southern frontier. The Rind flows across the north-eastern extremity of the district, in a direction parallel to the Seyngur, but about fifteen miles more to the eastward. The Pandwa and some other streams of the district are mere torrents during the periodical rains, and cease to flow during the dry season. All the streams run towards the south-east, indicating the general slope of the country to be in that direction; but there is also a slope from the middle part of the Doab towards the Jumna, all the streams of the district being ultimately discharged into that river. The levels taken in laying down the Etawah branch of the prolon-\ngation of the Ganges Canal, have shown the elevation of the country above the sea to diminish from about 676 at the northern frontier, to 610 at the town of Etawah.\n\nThe soil is in general better in the eastern and north-eastern parts of the district, than towards the Jumna; and the natural fertility of the former is also more favoured by irrigation, in consequence of water being obtainable from wells at a less depth. To the right or south-west of the Jumna, in the pergunnah of Janibrast, the country is very rugged, barren, and wild, and from the inequality of the surface, and the depth at which the water lies from it, irrigation is scarcely practicable. The principal rubbi or spring crops are wheat, barley, gram (Cicer arietinum), and other pulse of various kinds. The kurreef or autumnal crop consists of opium, sugarcane, cotton, indigo, rice, jowar (Sorghum vulgare), bajra (Holcus spicatus), moth (Phaseolus aconitifolius). The government assessment upon the lands of this district has been fixed for a specified period, and is not liable to increase till the year 1871. In the vicinity of the cantonment of Etawah, the seeds of European vegetables are sown after the rainy season, at the close of summer, and peas, cauliflowers, and lettuce are fit for use at Christmas, attaining a high degree of excellence; carrots and other esculent roots are of inferior quality; oranges, citrons, limes, and lemons, are very fine, and grapes succeed tolerably. Melons are abundant, luxuriant, and excellent. The apple, mango, plantain, guava, jak (Artocarpus integrifolia), succeed well; but pomegranates are scarcely worth gathering. The ravines and wilder tracts are ornamented by oleanders, acacias, palms, the nim (Melia azadirachta), pipal (Ficus religiosa). \"Every tree is tenanted by numerous birds; superb falcons look out from their lofty eyries, and wild peacocks fling their magnificent trains over the lower boughs, ten or twelve being frequently perceived upon the same tree. The smaller birds, sparrow-hawks, green pigeons, blue jays, actually crowd the branches. The crow-pheasant whirrs as strange footsteps approach, and wings his way to deeper solitudes; while flocks of paroquets, upon the slightest disturbance, issue screaming from their woody coverts, and, spreading their emerald plumes, soar up until they melt into the golden sky above.\" Guinea-fowl, and the\ncommon gallinaceous poultry, run wild in the jungle. The Jumna and other streams are well stocked with excellent fish. The wild hog, antelope, porcupine, frequent the jungle and desert tracts. Jackals are numerous, and wolves are so bold and ferocious, as frequently at nightfall to rush into the villages and carry off children. Hyenas are not uncommon, and though generally rather shy, are, when driven to bay, ferocious and very destructive.\n\nThe unsheltered situation of Etawah affords ample opportunity for the contemplation of the changes of the atmosphere. In no part of India do the hot winds blow with greater fury. They commence in March, and continue during the whole of April and May. The wind usually rises about eight in the morning, and, continuing through the whole day, subsides at sunset, though it sometimes blows throughout the whole night. \"Every article of furniture is burning to the touch; the hardest wood, if not well covered with blankets, will split with a report like that of a pistol; and linen taken from the drawers is as if just removed from a kitchen fire. The nights are terrible, every apartment being heated to excess, each may be compared to a large oven.\" The human constitution suffers great exhaustion from this state of temperature. The hot winds are succeeded by the monsoon or periodical rains, the transition being marked by a furious tornado. Even at midday, darkness as of night sets in, caused by the dense clouds and volumes of dust; and so loud is the roar of the storm, that the incessant peals of thunder can be heard only at intervals, whilst the flashes of lightning seldom pierce through the gloom. The rain then descends in torrents, floods the country, and refreshes the animal and vegetable world. \"Before the watery pools have penetrated into the parched earth, so rapid is the growth of vegetation, patches of green appear along the plain, and those who take up their posts in the veranda for an hour or two may literally see the grass grow. In the course of a single day the sandy hillocks will be covered with verdure, and in a very short time the grass becomes high and rank.\" The rains usually continue from the first or second week in June until the middle of October, and in some seasons are very violent, causing extensive and destructive inundations.\nETAWAH.\n\nThe final full is generally the heaviest, lasting three or four days, and ushering in cool weather. The climate is delightful from October to March; exercise in the open air may be taken with satisfaction on foot until ten o'clock in the forenoon, and all day in carriages; fires are requisite to comfort in the evening, and warm bedding is requisite at night.\n\nThe vigorous administration of the laws by the British authorities has of late years much checked the hand of crime in this district, which was formerly infamous as one of the principal haunts and places of refuge of the Thugs and Phansigars,* and whose secret and systematic robberies and murders have been carried to an appalling extent all over Hindostan. Some of these wretches were Mahomedans, but the majority were Hindoos;\u2020 some gangs contained a mixture of all denominations and castes. In some instances these assassins were under the protection of the zemindars or landed proprietors of the eastern part of the district, but the mixed gangs generally lurked in the ravines and jungles of the wild tract of Sindouse, on the right of the Jumna, and in the Doab between that river and the Chumbul. Some ostensibly followed agricultural avocations, or other pursuits equally unsuspected, though they were in reality supported by their nefarious practices; others were mere vagrants, living, when urged by want, on the flesh of jackals and other unclean animals. To so great an extent did the crime of thuggee once prevail, that in one year (1808) sixty-seven dead bodies were taken out of wells in this district.\n\nThe population in 1848 was ascertained by official return to amount to 481,224. Of this number, 284,838 are returned as Hindoos engaged in agriculture; 170,524 Hindoos engaged in other pursuits; 4,691 Mahomedans and others, not Hindoos, agricultural; and 21,171 of those classes, non-agricultural. Hence it is seen that the Hindoos constitute an overwhelming majority of the population.\n\n* Miscreants, whose occupation was murder for the sake of plunder. Their victims were generally travellers, whom they seduced to bear them company, and on the occurrence of a convenient opportunity, strangled them.\n\n\u2020 These considered themselves under the especial patronage of the Hindoo goddess of destruction.\nETAWAH.\n\nThe following is a classification of the towns and villages of the district:\n\nNumber containing less than 1,000 inhabitants ... 1,461\nDitto more than 1,000 and less than 5,000 ....... 50\nDitto more than 5,000 and less than 10,000 ...... 3*\nDitto more than 10,000 and less than 50,000 ...... 1\u2020\n\n1,515\n\nThe principal towns will be found noticed in the proper places.\n\nThe principal routes through the district are\u20141. From south-east to north-west, from Calpee to Muttra, by Etawah, running parallel to the left bank of the Jumna, and on an average ten or twelve miles from it; 2. from south-east to north-west, from Cawnpore, joining the former route five miles from the cantonment of Etawah; 3. from Lucknow, in Oude, to the cantonment of Etawah, and, subsequently crossing the Jumna, to Gwalior; 4. from north-east to south-west, from the cantonment of Futteghur to that of Etawah; 5. from north to south, from the cantonment of Mynpooree to that of Etawah.\n\nThe right of the British government to this tract dates from 1801, when it was ceded by the Nawaub Vizier, forming a portion of the possessions alienated by that prince in commutation of subsidy.\n\nETAWAH,\u2020 a town, the principal place of the pargannah and also of the district of the same name, is situate about a mile\u00b2 east of the left bank of the Jumna, here crossed by ferry,\u00b3 or occasionally by a bridge of boats. Access to the water is had by means of numerous ghats or flights of stairs, some in a state of great decay, others recently built\u2074 by wealthy Hindoos, to afford devotees easy approach for the purpose of ritual ablution.

These indentations appear to have been formed by the violent torrents caused by the periodical rains washing away the softer parts of the elevated strata, leaving prominent the indurated kankar or calcareous conglomerate, in some instances sixty feet above the river. Hodges, who visited the place in 1783, describes it as then \"large, but very wretched, having but two tolerable houses.\" Tiefenthaler spoke of it, about thirty years before, as \"a very ancient and famous town, situate on the east side of the Jumna, and formerly well peopled. At present,\" he continues, \"many old houses have fallen down, The fort, situate on a high sandhill, on the bank of the Jumna, which flows along its southern side, is of moderate size, and has a foundation of brick.\" In the time of Baber, in the early part of the sixteenth century, it was of much note, and was governed by the son-in-law of that sovereign, by whom it is repeatedly mentioned. At present its prosperity appears somewhat on the increase, in consequence of its favoured commercial position at the junction of the road from Calpee to Agra with that from Cawnpore to the same place. The jail is one of the largest and best secured of any in the North-Western Provinces. The cantonment is a mile north-west of the town. It is little liked by Europeans, who consider it to be \"peculiarly desolate, and to exhibit in full perfection the dreary features of a jungle-station. Upon a wide sandy plain, nearly destitute of trees, half a dozen habitable bungalows lie scattered, intermixed with the ruins of others, built for the accommodation of a larger garrison than is now considered necessary for the security of the place, a single wing of a regiment of sepoys being deemed sufficient for the performance of the duties of this melancholy out-station.\" The population consists of 17,783 persons.

It is of inconsiderable size, and surrounded by an indifferent mud wall. Here is a large tank, inclosed by massive embankments of masonry, and having in the middle a polygonal building* two stories high, surmounted by a dome. It is built of stone, and communicates with the land by a bridge of several arches of the same material. Local tradition attributes its construction to a retainer of the imperial court of Delhi, but his name has not been preserved. The town has a bazar, and water and supplies are abundant. The road in this part of the route is, on the whole, good.

Still it may in India be considered a town.\" It has a bazar, and is supplied with water from wells. The population is returned at 11,792. Its present name is of comparatively recent date, and has probably been given in honour of some chief of Afghan or Persian descent, Firoz being a usual appellative among those of that lineage.

Its area is returned at ninety-seven\\(^1\\) square miles; but this return, it is explained by the deputy\\(^2\\) commissioner, refers only to the district of Ferozapore as it stood before the war with Lahore. Subsequently, four pergunnahs, containing a very considerable tract of country, were added to it; and at a still later period, the larger portion of one of them was severed from the district, and transferred to a native chief, the rajah of Furreedkote. Part of the territory thus alienated was granted to the rajah, in consequence of his good behaviour during the war; another part was subject to certain cash payments; and a third portion was in exchange for other territory more conveniently situate with reference to Ferozpore. This latter process gave additional complication to the circumstances of the district, which is again increased by the incorporation with it of certain pergunnahs from Wudnee, abolished as a separate district. The fact that the latest return was made immediately\nafter these changes, and before any sufficient arrangement could be entered into for insuring accuracy, accounts for the presentation of a statement which does not even offer any pretensions to correctness. The circumstances which have rendered the return as to area unsatisfactory, are equally applicable to the return of population, under which the number is given at 16,890. The district, however, is said to be very thinly peopled, not a thirtieth part, it is alleged, being under cultivation. The remainder is either barren or covered with jungle; but the former populousness and prosperity of the country are proved by the existence of several ruined villages and towns, as well as of fine brick-lined wells, now half-filled with rubbish. The wells at a distance from the river are deep, but much of the soil might be irrigated without recourse to them, as the dry bed of a nullah or watercourse, called the Sukri, traverses the country with a sinuous channel, and it would only require a canal a mile in length to admit the water of the Sutlej or Gharrah. In the following extract, the climate is represented as favourable to the European constitution:\u2014\u201cThe climate of Ferozepore promises well: it is peculiar to this part of India, and unlike any other, except Loodiana. Continual cloudy weather, occasionally rainy, and a climate particularly advantageous to Europeans, as well as natives. We can ride out all day without the slightest inconvenience, except that sometimes it is rather too cold than otherwise, to be comfortable without a great coat: scarcely any sick in hospital.\u201d The condition of the climate here described was in January. The territory of Ferozepore escheated to the British, upon the demise, in 1835, of Sirdarree Luchmun Kooar. The claims of Lahore were subsequently compromised by a division of the territory with Runjeet Singh, the portion then allotted to that potentate again changing masters, as above noticed, upon the conclusion of the Lahore war.\n\nFEROZPORE, in Sirhind, a town and fort so named because built by Feroze Toghluk, who sat on the throne of Delhi from 1351 to 1388. It is the chief place of a portion of the British possessions in that quarter, and is situate three miles from the left bank of the Sutlej. It must have been formerly a large town, as the extensive ruins around it indicate.\nThe fort is an irregular building, incapable of defence against a regular attack. It is a hundred yards long, forty broad, and has a dry ditch, ten feet wide and ten deep, with one gateway, which is on the east face. The interior is filled with earth to half the height of the walls, and the mound thus formed is crowded with mean brick houses and mud hovels, separated by alleys not exceeding six feet wide. The town is surrounded by a ditch and by a weak mud wall. It is well supplied with water from a hundred and twenty-four brick-lined wells. Before the introduction of artillery, and when in good repair, the fort must have defied attempts to storm it; and even now, according to the report of an eyewitness, when viewed at a distance, its appearance is very striking. \"The large, heaped-together, and well-raised round towers of the forts about here,\" says a visitant, \"give more an impression of England than any I have seen in India. At two or three miles distant, in looking on Ferozepore, you might fancy yourself gazing on Arundel, if not Windsor Castle.\"\n\nThe town, though originally very mean, has been improved since its occupation by the British; bazars have been made, and several good shops established. The population has also greatly increased. Its rapid improvement is thus described by a late traveller:\u2014\"When I was at Ferozepore in January, 1839, the streets were narrow, and in the filthiest state imaginable; the houses all huddled together. When I was there in February, 1841, on my return from Affghanistan, a totally new prospect presented itself. The fort and town had been new-modelled, indeed rebuilt of burned brick; wide streets, with colonnaded rows of shops, had been constructed, and the whole exhibited the promise of an extensive mercantile city. For this improvement, we are much indebted to the zeal and exertions of Captain H. Lawrence, assistant political agent. The native merchants of India and the Punjab, seeing distinctly the dawn of commercial prosperity in that quarter, at once entered into the speculation of erecting long lines of shops and warehouses, and increasing the town; and there can be no doubt that in a very short period Ferozepore will become one of the most important mercantile entrepots in the north-west part of India.\" For this purpose it is well adapted, by its situation near one of the great ferries over the Gharrah,\nFEROZPORE.\n\nand the means of easy communication with the lower part of the Punjaub, Bahawulpore, and Sinde, afforded by that great river, and its recipient the Indus. There is also facility of communication by good roads with all parts of Sirhind. In November, 1838, an interview took place here between Runjeet Singh, then maharaja of the Punjaub, and Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of British India, on which occasion 10,000* men, rendezvoused at Ferozapore previously to their advance to the invasion of Affghanistan, went through the evolutions of a bloodless battle for the amusement of the Seik ruler, as well as to produce on him an impression of the superiority of British discipline and tactics. In the subsequent operations of the Affghan war, it was repeatedly visited by British armies, marching and countermarching. Within the monumental church erected in this town, the names of the gallant officers and men who fell in the Sutlej and Punjaub campaigns will be perpetuated on tablets sacred to their memory.\u00b2 The population of Ferozapore is about 6,000. It is distant W. of Loodiana 79 miles, N.W. of Calcutta 1,181\u00b3 miles. Lat. 30\u00b0 55', long. 75\u00b0 35'.\n\nFEROZPORE.\u00b9\u2020\u2014The principal place of the pergunnah of the same name, in the British district of Goorgaon, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, on the route from Delhi to Alwar, and 74 miles\u00b2 S. of the former. Jacquemont\u00b3 describes it as surrounded by a rather strong wall, flanked with small towers, and inhabited principally by Mussulmans. The fort had strong walls and towers, constructed of mud and mounted with cannon, and contained the nawaub's palace, of no great size, but handsomely built, and furnished in the English style. According to the latest official return (1848), the number of inhabitants was 7,989;\u2074 but this statement was founded on a census made two three years earlier, and chiefly, if not entirely, through native agency.\n\nThe jaghire of Ferozpore, containing an area of about 138\u2075\n\n* Hough states the number at between 14,000 and 15,000 men.\u00b9\n\u2020 Jacquemont\u00b2 states that it was built by Feroz Shah, no doubt meaning Feroz Toghak, who reigned in Delhi from 1351\u00b3 to 1388, and was remarkable for the great number of his public works, amongst which, 200 towns\u2074 are enumerated. Ferishta\u2075 indeed mentions that he built a fort called Ferozpore; but this was close to Sirhind, and a hundred miles north of the town which is the subject of the present notice.\nsquare miles, with that of Loharoo, containing 350, were granted, in the beginning of the present century, the former by Lork Lake, the latter by the ruler of Alwur, to Ahmad Buksh Khan; on whose death, in 1827, they descended to his son, Shumsooddeen Khan. The two younger brothers of Shumsoodden, having well-founded claims on Loharoo, in virtue of an arrangement made by their father Ahmad Buksh, Mr. William Fraser, the British political agent at Delhi, exerted himself to induce the British government to make a partition in their favour. Shumsooddeen, to avert the threatened loss, and in revenge for the proposed measure, as well as for some censure passed, and some coercion exercised, in regard to certain parts of his conduct, caused Mr. Fraser to be murdered, at Delhi, by a hired assassin, in October, 1835. A year afterwards, he was brought to trial for the murder, and, being duly convicted, was hanged. His jaghires being declared forfeited, Loharoo was granted to his brothers, and Ferozapore embodied with the British district of Goorgaon.\n\nThere are works in the town for smelting iron ore, raised at a mine three miles distant. The bazar is well supplied, and water is abundant. The road in this part of the route is good. Elevation above the sea about 840 feet. Distance N.W. from Calcutta, by Agra and Muttra, 895 miles. Lat. $27^\\circ 47'$, long. $77^\\circ 1'$.\n\nFILOR, or FALOUR.\u2014A town in the Julinder Dooab division of the Punjab, on the route from Amritsar to Loodiana, and about six miles N.W. of the latter place. It is situate on the right bank of the Sutluj, and is defended by a fort, built on the high steep rising from the river. The fort, which was constructed by order of Runjeet Singh in 1809, is small, affording accommodation for a garrison of only 150 men, but it is rendered conspicuous by its large barbican. Here is the ferry over the Sutluj, for the communication of Loodiana and its neighbourhood with Amritsar and Lahore. The Sutluj, in inundation, forms extensive sheets of water round the town, and these remain after the river has shrunk to the confines of its usual channel.

DAVID.\u2014A town and fort on the coast of Coromandel, in the British district of South Arcot, presidency of Madras. This place, formerly known as Tegnapatam, was purchased by the East-India Company from a native prince in 1691, and became a station of some importance. Upon the capitulation of Madras to the French in 1746, the Company\u2019s agent here assumed the general administration of British affairs in the south of India, and successfully resisted an attack made by Dupleix upon the settlement. In 1756, Clive was appointed governor of Fort St. David. It was attacked by the French in 1758, both by sea and land, and capitulated, when the fortifications were demolished, and were never rebuilt.

The cantonment is on a gently rising ground, with a gravelly soil and well drained. There are no jungles nor marshes in the vicinity, nor any stagnant water, except that contained in a fine deep tank with a rocky bottom, which yields an abundant and excellent supply throughout the year. The atmosphere is rather moist; fogs and heavy dews prevail at the close of the winter and the early part of spring. The heat is less than at Seringapatam, a few miles distant, and the thermometer is at no time much above 85\u00b0. The monsoon rains generally cease about the middle of September. Notwithstanding the many apparently favourable circumstances of its site, it has been from time to time subject to attacks of severe endemic fever, generally of intermittent type. They appear, however, to be in a great degree confined to the native population, the British generally enjoying good health. Elevation above the sea 2,300 feet.

It flows southward, after proceeding a short distance to the east of Hyderabad, which it insulates, by sending off to the westward a branch which rejoins the main river about fifteen miles below the town. Below this last divarication it bears the name of the Goonee, takes a southeasterly course, discharging its water eastward into the Purana or Phurraun, and ultimately into the sea by the Koree mouth.\n\nFULJAR TAL, in the British district of Shahjehanpoor, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a small lake, the source of the river Goomtee.

It is situate close to a grove of very fine mango-trees, in a flat fertile country, well cultivated, especially under cotton. Heber\u00b2 describes his visit to this place on November 13th as delightful:\u2014\"The morning was positively cold, and the whole scene, with the exercise of the march, the picturesque groups of men and animals round me, the bracing air, the singing of birds, the light mist hanging on the trees, and the glistening dew, had something at once so oriental and so English, I have seldom found anything better adapted to raise a man's animal spirits and to put him in good temper with himself and all the world.\" There is a bazar here, and water and supplies are abundant.

It is bounded on the north by the British district Mymensing; on the east by the British district Dacca; on the south by the British district Backergunge; and on the west by the British districts Jessore and Pubna: it lies between lat. 23\u00b0 3'\u201424\u00b0 5'; long. 89\u00b0 30'\u201490\u00b0 15', and has an area of 2,052\u00b2 square miles. Fureedpore is altogether an alluvial tract, low and swampy in the southern and north-eastern parts, where it is much subject to inundation; but in the north and north-western portions, rather more elevated, with a deep soil of fine quality.\n\nFew districts more abound in rivers: the Ganges, in this part of its course called the Podda, flowing from west to east, touches on the western frontier at Juffergunge, where that river receives an offset of the Konaie or Jabuna, by which its volume of water is more than doubled. Thence taking a south-easterly course for fifteen miles to Malapora, it enters the district, through which it flows for forty-five miles, to Kagauta, on the eastern frontier, at which place it sends off\n\n* It is also called Dacca Jelalpoor.\neastward a great branch, called the Kirtynassa; and then taking a southerly course for fifteen miles, it at Hobigunje crosses the southern frontier into the British district of Backergunge. It on the left side receives numerous considerable watercourses, and on the right side sends off many others, especially during the rainy season, when it rolls along with a vast volume of water, four, five, or six\\(^3\\) miles in width. The Konaie or Jabuna, from the north, touches on this district at its north-western corner, and flowing southerly for about five miles, forms its western boundary as far as Ameerabad, where it sends off to the left, or south-eastwards, a large stream, called the Dulasseree, and, turning south-westward, it receives, at a distance of five miles, the Oora Sagar, on the right side; the united stream a few miles lower down falling into the Ganges.\n\nThe Dulasseree holds a south-easterly course for thirty-five miles to Sabar, on the eastern frontier, towards the British district of Dacca, where it receives the Bansi, flowing from the north. From the confluence, the Dulasseree holds a course south-east, forming for twelve miles the eastern boundary of Fureedpore towards Dacca, when it passes into that district. The Barashee or Chundna, a large offset of the Ganges, flowing from north-west to south-east, touches this district on the western frontier, at Moodoocallee, and taking a course very sinuous, but generally southerly, for fifty-five miles, to Gopalgunge, it for that distance forms the western boundary, towards the British district Pubna and Jessore. Rennell remarks\\(^4\\) that \"the only subordinate branch of the Ganges that is at all times navigable, is the Chundnah river, which separates at Moddapore, and terminates in the Hooringotta;\" and Horsburgh states that ships of 500 tons can\\(^5\\) enter and load in the Hooringotta estuary. The Barashee or Chundna is the only stream in this district navigable throughout the year; all the others, including the main stream of the Ganges or Podda, during the dry season become in many parts so shallow,\\(^6\\) that even small boats cannot traverse them.\n\nThe climate during March, April, May, and the early part of June, is characterized by great heat, in consequence of the situation of the district with respect to the tropics, and its depressed level, scarcely raised above the sea. Towards the close of June, the south-west monsoon begins to set in, pro-\n\n---\n\n\\(^3\\) Heber, Narrat. of Journ. i. 101, 102.\n\n\\(^4\\) Mem. 339.\n\n\\(^5\\) East-India Directory, i. 640.\n\n\\(^6\\) Bengal and Agra Guide, 1841, vol. ii. part i. 286.\nFUREEDPORE.\n\nducing heavy rains, which prevail throughout July, August, and September, when they cease, and the climate gradually becomes comparatively cool, continuing so until the close of February.\n\nNo information appears to have been collected respecting the zoology of the district, though from the physical circumstances of the country, it may be inferred that it would be interesting.\n\nThe soil is in general very rich, particularly in the northern part, producing fine crops of sugarcane, cotton, indigo, oil-seeds, and some others of less value; while the swampy grounds are fruitful in rice. Sugar is probably the most important crop, being in brisk demand; and it is stated that above 1,000,000 pounds\\(^7\\) were exported in 1840, for the British market.\n\nThe manufacturing industry of the district is chiefly employed in the preparation of indigo and sugar, and in the distillation of rum. A considerable quantity of coarse cotton cloth is made for home use. Here are mahajans or merchants, reputed to be considerable capitalists, who drive an extensive and lucrative business, there being a brisk traffic in the import, export, and transit departments.\n\nThe population is returned at 855,000,\\(^8\\) an amount which, compared with the area, indicates a relative density of 416 per mile. Mussulmans are more numerous in the southern part, and Brahminists in the remainder of the district. There are some thousands of native Christians of the Romish persuasion, descended from the offspring of the union of Portuguese with native women.

It is bounded on the north by the British districts Budaon and Shahjehanpore; on the east by the territory of Oude; on the south by the British districts of Etawah and Cawnpore; and on the west by Etawah and Mynpooree. It lies between lat. 26\u00b0 46'\u201427\u00b0 43', long. 78\u00b0 57'\u201480\u00b0 2', and has an area of 1,909 square miles. The general slope of the country is to the south-east, as indicated by the courses of the Ganges, Esun, and Rind, which run in that direction. The south-western portion of the district is part of the crest or gentle elevation extending along the Doab at nearly an equal distance from the Ganges and the Jumna. The Rind, which rises on the western side of the line of waterheads, flows into the latter river. The elevation of the stream of the Kali Nadi (east), on the north-western frontier, is 614 feet above the sea. It flows for 115 miles, either traversing the district or forming its boundaries, and five miles north of its southern frontier it falls into the Ganges. Cautley found the general slope of the country to be 1\u00bd foot (1:138) in a mile. If allowance be made for the windings of the stream, the elevation of the spot where it is discharged into the\nFURRUCKABAD.\n\nGanges may be concluded to be about 520 feet; and it appears probable that no part of the district is more than 200 feet above this. The Ganges, when it first touches on the Furruckabad district, flowing in a south-easterly direction, forms its north-eastern boundary for twenty-five miles, dividing it from the districts of Budaon and Shajehanpore; then, crossing the frontier, it pursues its course in a more southerly direction through the district for thirty miles, when it recrosses the frontier, and for thirty-five miles again forms the boundary of the district, separating it from the territory of Oude. Furruckabad is thus divided into two very unequal parts, a small portion of not more than 100,000 acres being situate on the north-eastern side of the river, the remainder in the Doab. The Ganges is navigable throughout that part of its course which touches on or flows through this district. The Kali Nadi, though a small stream, is also navigable throughout the district. The Ramgunga flows in a direction from north-west to south-east for about thirty miles, through the north-eastern part, holding a course nearly parallel to the Ganges, but to the eastward of it. The Esun and the Rind are petty streams.\n\nThe soil varies a good deal in quality, much of that on the banks of the Ganges being khadir or marsh, having a deep rich soil, saturated with moisture. The town of Imrutoor, in this tract, is described as situate in a \"country spread for many surrounding leagues with one sheet of luxuriant cultivation, interspersed with beautiful and ancient mango-trees. In the rainy season this rich and fruitful tract is scarcely habitable or passable, the whole country between the Ganges and Bareilly exhibiting one vast lake of water.\" Even in the driest part of the year, water may be obtained at a very small depth below the surface, and many ponds and watercourses occur. The most important crop on soil of this description is indigo, which is thought to be indigenous, being everywhere observable wild; and the herb thus produced has been said to yield a finer dye than when cultivated. The culture is generally managed by the natives, who dispose of the crop to European capitalists for conversion into a marketable state, a process which is largely carried on in the town of Furruckabad.

Where unimproved by human industry, the aspect of the country is dismal. \"There are vast tracts without a tree or shrub, which are covered with a cloud of dust as often as the wind blows, which at this season generally happens from ten to four every day. The bleak, desolate, and dreary aspect of the country, where you are constantly sinking at every step in loose sand, and blinded by showers of dust, gives an idea of the difficulty of travelling through those immense deserts that lie between these countries and Europe.\"\n\nIn many places in the midland and southern parts of the district, the soil is fertile, producing fine wheat, barley, and pulse, and the crops of maize and sugarcane are so luxuriant and dense, as to attain a height of eight or ten feet, and exclude the rays of the sun. The southern part is so well wooded, as, when viewed from some distance, to have the appearance of a forest. Cotton and tobacco are grown chiefly for home consumption. Many vegetables of usual growth in Europe succeed well here, especially potatoes, which are so much esteemed, that they are sent to many other parts. The land revenue in this district has been fixed by the government for a term of years, and is not liable to be increased until the year 1865.\n\nThe population of this district is returned at 854,799; of which number, 514,529 are classed as Hindoo agricultural; 238,895 as Hindoo non-agricultural; 34,792 as Mohammedans and others, agricultural; and 66,583 as coming under the same general head, but non-agricultural. The Mussulmans are said to be descendants of the Patans or Afghans, who early in the last century established themselves in the tract extending between Oude and the Punjab, and have been reputed to retain some of the sanguinary and turbulent spirit characteristic of their ancestors. Lord Valentia describes the condition of society before the settlement of the district by the British authorities in gloomy terms:\u2014\"The state of the country was\n\n* 13th February.\nthen most wretched. Murders were so frequent at Furruckabad, that people dared not venture there after sunset, and the workmen who came out to the cantonments always retired to their own houses during daylight.\" He adds, that seventy persons were in prison to be tried for murder. Tennant also, writing in 1798, complains hearing of the numbers and murderous outrages of the banditti of Furruckabad. Archer, writing thirty years later, and even after the establishment of British rule, says, \"No peasant thinks of living out of the village in a cottage by himself: it would not be secure, and would certainly tempt to plunder and murder.\" Happily, a very different state now prevails. The district is not only tranquil, but prosperous. The recent revenue settlement, effected for a term of thirty years,\u2014a period sufficient to afford opportunity for agricultural enterprise, without surrendering in perpetuity the just rights and interests of government,\u2014has been extended to this district, in common with other portions of the North-Western Provinces. Under it, the rights of all parties being defined and secured, industry is sure of its reward, and consequently flourishes. Honest labour has superseded lawless rapine as an occupation; and person and property are alike safe. The minuter advantages of civilization are in course of introduction, and efforts have been made to communicate to every class some measure of education. The progress of improvement is mainly attributable to the exertions of the late Mr. Thomason, while filling the office of lieutenant-governor of the North-West Provinces. \"To him,\" says a late writer, \"is due an improved executive administration, such as we have never had elsewhere in India.\"\n\nThe principal routes in the district are\u20141. From west to east, from Agra to Mynpooree, whence one branch proceeds to Futteghur, and another (the grand trunk road from Calcutta to Delhi) to Cawnpore. 2. From Allyghur to Futteghur, and thence to Cawnpore. 3. From south-west to north-east, from Etawah to Futtehghurh, and continued thence to Bareilly.\n\nThe principal places are Furruckabad, Chubramow, Imrutpoor, Allygury, Kunnoj, Khudaganj, Nawabganj, Jalalabad, which will be found noticed in their proper places.\n\nIn the earlier part of the eighteenth century, the Rohilla Patans had established themselves in the tract comprised in\nFURRUCKABAD.\n\nthe present district. In 1749, Ahmed Shah, of Delhi, urged by his vizier, marched thither, and confiscated the estates of the deceased ruler, who had just fallen in an unsuccessful war with the Rohillas. The country, with the exception of a small portion allotted to the support of the family of the late prince, was bestowed on the vizier, from whom, however, it was wrested by Ahmed Khan, brother of the former ruler, who forthwith proceeded to invade Oude. Expelled from that territory, though not without difficulty, Ahmed sought refuge in the hills, but on his submission was restored to Furruckabad, with a revenue of sixteen lacs of rupees. After being occupied by various classes of adventurers, it appears, however, to have reverted to the vizier of Oude, who, in 1801, transferred his claims to the East-India Company. In 1802 the Company assumed actual possession of Furruckabad, liquidating the claims of the tributary Patan nawaub by a fixed monthly stipend of 9,000 rupees, in addition to which, an annual sum of nearly 180,000 rupees was bestowed in pensions and charitable allowances to his dependants. In 1804, Holkar, at the head of a great body of cavalry, the number of which has been estimated at 60,000, ravaged this tract, and, flying before the British army under Lord Lake, was surprised at the town of Furruckabad, and having lost 3,000 men, the remainder were so reduced by desertions and other causes, that not above half their number ever rejoined the standard of their leader: the loss of the British was only two dragoons killed, and about twenty wounded. In their march to overtake the enemy, and in the pursuit subsequent to the route, the British traversed a distance of above seventy miles in twenty-four hours.\n\nFURRUCKABAD, the principal place of the district of the same name, in the North-West Provinces, is situate between two and three miles west of the right bank of the Ganges; its Patan founders, from their exclusive addiction to military pursuits, attaching no value to the facilities afforded by the great river, navigable upwards for nearly two hundred\n\n* Happy-town; from Farrukh, \"happy,\" and Abad, \"town.\" It received its name from its founder, Muhammed Khan Rangash, who bestowed it in honour of the ill-fated Farrukhsir Padshah of Delhi. That prince ascended the throne 1713, and was murdered 1719; consequently the town was founded in the intervening period.\nFURRUCKABAD.\n\nmiles, and downwards to the ocean. Furruckabad is rather a handsome town, and considered healthy, though many of the streets are shaded by trees, a circumstance usually considered to have in India a tendency to produce malaria. Its population is returned at 56,300 persons. The healthiness of the place may be owing, in a great degree, to its cleanliness, a point more attended to here than in most Indian towns; and the width of the streets and squares no doubt contributes towards this good end. The trade is considerable, and the banking business especially is extensive and important. The surrounding country being fertile and well cultivated, provisions are abundant and excellent. In the town is a mud fort, built as a residence for the nawaub, on a considerable height, commanding extensive views of the Ganges and of the surrounding country. The commercial importance of this town was marked by its having a mint, the coinage of which circulated extensively, especially throughout the North-Western Provinces.\n\n* Tiefenthaler describes the town as a large and important place in the days of the power of the nawaubs of Furruckabad, about a century ago. \"It is surrounded,\" he says, \"by a lime-cemented wall, with battlements, and enriched by a foss, and has twelve gates; three being directed towards each cardinal point. Four are main gates; one towards the Ganges, another towards Mao, a third towards Kannauj, a fourth towards Agra. The houses are low and lime-cemented, except a few built of brick, at least outside. They are tolerably commodious internally, and neatly finished with tiles. The high street, which is inhabited by merchants and tradesmen, extends half a mile from the red gate to the fort; and another street, from the red gate to that towards Mao, is a full mile long. The circuit of the town is, according to some, six miles; according to others, nine. It is the emporium of all commodities for this part of India, from Delhi, Cashmere, Bengal, and Surat. The fort, in which is the residence of the governor, is about a mile in circumference, and is situate to the north-west of the upper part of the high street, and is surrounded with a battlemented mud wall. The site is elevated, and the defences are rendered more effective by towers projecting above the rampart, and by a dry ditch of unequal breadth. The entrance to the place is through an outer and an inner gate.\" \"The new palace, as well as the old, is of square outline, and has low hexagonal turrets along the sides. It has a lofty watch-tower.\" Hamilton states that \"the town is surrounded by a wall, which has been kept in tolerable order by the magistrates;\" and adds, \"by the police arrangements, the city is divided into seven wards, which are again partitioned into 194 mohullahs, many of which are narrow, and appear at one period to have had barrier gates.\"\n\n4 Archer, Tours in Upper India, I. 82.\n5 Statistics of N.W.

It lies twenty miles to the right of the great north-western route from Calcutta to Delhi, by the new line, and distant N.W. from the former 660 miles, S.E. from the latter 160, N.W. from Lucknow 95, E. from Agra 90.

On acquiring supremacy in the Delhi territory, the British government found Mozuffer Khan in possession of the jaghire, and his rights were respected in the subsequent grant of Jhujhur to the Buraitch family. The chief bears the title of nawaub. The centre of the estate is in lat. 28\u00b0 24', long. 76\u00b0 52'. Its area is about twenty-two square miles. The population, assuming the average of the adjacent territories, may be estimated at 4,400.

It is a thriving and populous village, and has a bazar and market, and is abundantly supplied with water from wells. The road in this part of the route is good; the country open, level, and well cultivated. Here, in 1796,\nthe Rohilla Patans were defeated by a British force under Sir Robert Abercrombie. Within view of the action were about thirty thousand native troops, in the service of the nawab of Oude, ostensibly an ally of the East-India Company; but they kept aloof until the British, after suffering very severely, totally routed their adversaries, when their treacherous auxiliaries rushed in and seized the greater part of the spoil. The cavalry of the British army fled on the first charge of the Patans, who, taking advantage of the opening thus made, got into the rear, and cut to pieces six companies of infantry, but ultimately fell before the unshaken courage of the survivors. Ramsay, the commander of the cavalry, who showed the example of flight, saved himself from the punishment due to his delinquency by taking refuge in America, and ultimately was employed by Napoleon in his commissariat. The East-India Company raised a monument to those of their troops who fell in the action. \"It is of obelisk form, and stands on a small mound, the only elevation in this vast plain, on which point of vantage the enemies' guns were ranged, and afterwards taken. The names of fourteen British officers are recorded on the 'storied stone;' among whom were three commanding officers of regiments. Within a stone's throw of this plain and simple monument, rises the carved and minaretted tomb of two illustrious Rohilla chiefs, who fell in the action.\" A collection of dwellings, the extension of the contiguous village of Betoura, and which were the immediate scene of the conflict, has received the appellation of Futehgunje, or \"Victory Market.\" Lat. 28\u00b0 28', long. 79\u00b0 24'.\n\nFUTEH GUNJE (EASTERN), in the British district of Bareilly, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a town on the route from the town of Bareilly to Shahjehanpoor, and 23 miles S.E. of the former.

The town was founded by Shujahuddawlat, the nawaub of Oude, in commemoration of a victory which, gained by the British army in 1774, gave him possession of a large portion of Rohilcund. It is probable that the battle was not, however, fought on the site of the present Futehgunje, but at Tessunah, about four miles north-west of it, and marked as a battle-field, with crossed swords, in Rennell's Bengal Atlas. The engagement is sometimes called the battle of Cutterah, or Kuttra, from a town three miles to the southeast of Futehgunje. The successive conflicts in an action so obstinately contested, probably took place in localities at a considerable distance from each other. Hafiz Rahmat Khan, the Rohilla commander, was described to Heber \"as a noble old warrior, with a long grey beard, who led his cavalry on in a brilliant style against the allied armies. When his nobles, at the head of their respective clans, either treacherous or timid, gave way, he remained almost alone on a rising ground in the heat of the fire, conspicuous by his splendid dress and beautiful horse, waving his hand, and vainly endeavouring to bring his army back to another charge, till, seeing that all was lost, he waved his hand once more, gave a shout, and galloped on the English bayonets. He fell, shot through and through.\" Colonel Champion, who commanded the British, had his body wrapped in shawls, and sent with due honour to his relatives.

It appears too great for either Eastern or Western Futehgunje, and should be assigned probably to a village of the same name farther north, and near the base of the mountains.\nFUTHABAD, in the British district of Agra, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a town, the principal place of the pergunnah of Futhabad, is situate on the right bank of the Junna.

The place in its present state is an expanse of ruins, inclosed by a high stone wall,3 about five4 miles in circuit, and having battlements and round towers. This\n\n* The correct name might be supposed to be Futhepoor Sikra, or \"Little Futhepoor,\" to distinguish it from Futtehpore, in the Doab. This last town, previously to Akbar's improvements at the other, was probably the more important of the two; but Baber1 mentions Sikri as the locality which, on account of the abundance of water, he chose as his place of encampment and battle-field, on which, in 1527, he overthrew2 Rana Sanga, of Mewar, at the head of the confederate princes of Rajasthan, and finally established Islam on the ruins of Brahminism, and secured the family of Timur in the sovereignty of Hindustan. On occasion of this victory, he assumed the title of Ghazi,3 or \"victorious champion of the faith,\" and, it may well be supposed, gave the name of Futhepoor, or \"Town of Victory,\" to Sikri, contiguous to the scene of the great battle, the event of which had rescued him and his army from a state bordering on despair. The learned translators of the Memoirs,4 however, quote, though without affirming the dubious authority of Thevenot, that the name was given by Akbar, the descendant of Baber. \"Sikri was a favourite place of Baber; when his grandson Akber made his pilgrimage on foot from Agra to Ajmere, to the tomb of Kwajeh Mundi, and back, to procure the saint's intercession for having male children, he visited a dervish named Selim, at Sikri, and learned from him that God had heard his prayers, and that he would have three sons. This prophecy,\" says Thevenot, \"was so pleasing to Akber, especially when it began to be accomplished, that he called his eldest son Selim, after the dervish, and gave the town, which had formerly been called Sikri, the name of Futhepoore, which signifies 'place of joy and pleasure,' and built there a very beautiful palace, with the intention of making it his capital.\"\n\nFerishta5 states a different motive for the name assigned by Akbar. \"The king considering the village of Seekry a particularly propitious spot, two of his sons having been born there, he ordered the foundation of a city to be laid there, which, after the conquest of Guzerat, he called Futtehpoor.\" And Hodges,6 without assigning any authority, states: \"The town of Futtypoor was formerly known by the name of Sicri, and received its present appellation from the Mogul emperor Akbar, who entitled it Futtypoor, i.e. 'place of victory,' from a decisive defeat which he gave near it to the Patans in the beginning of his reign.\"\n\n---\n\n1 E.I.C.

The scene of desolation is the more awful, as Akbar commenced those structures as late as 1571; and the fury of victorious enemies, principally Mahrattas, has in the comparatively brief interval reduced them to their present shattered or prostrate state. The most striking object at present is the great mosque, still in tolerable repair. The aspect of the great front is southwards, \"crowning\" the principal height, and overlooking the low country, the face of its walls terminating in a gigantic causeway, surmounted with domes and minarets. From a distant position, the effect of this enormous structure is to cause the hill on which it stands to dwindle into a mere hillock; but when the traveller arrives at its base, and can estimate the magnitude of the building by that of the eminence on which it is exalted, his admiration is raised to wonder and awe at the startling height to which it rises.\" The height of the gateway, from the pavement to the summit of the interior outline, is 72 feet, and to the exterior summit, 120. The gateway is reached by a flight of steps of almost unrivalled magnificence; but these are becoming dilapidated, the periodical rains, which sweep down the slope of the hill, annually loosening some and dislodging others, so that, if requisite repairs be not attended to, in a few years the whole of this superb portal must become a heap of shapeless ruins. The interior, to which this noble entrance leads, is a quadrangle nearly 500 feet square, and all around which runs a very lofty and majestic cloister, into which opens a range of cells, intended probably as lodges for dervishes, or for pilgrims. In this quadrangle, and to the left of the entrance, is a large mosque, surmounted by three fine domes of white marble, and opposite the entrance, the tomb of Shekh Selim Cheestee, a Mussulman ascetic, whose intercession by prayer to heaven Akbar had implored, that the imperial couch might be blessed by the birth of a son. The prayer was considered to be answered by the\n\n* According to Von Orlich, 150 feet.

Among these authorities, that of Hunter is unquestionably much the highest in point of accuracy.\ntimely birth of a prince, named Selim, in honour of the Shekh, and subsequently emperor of Hindostan, under the name of Jehangir. The outline of the tomb is a square of forty-six feet, the material white marble, elaborately carved with much taste, in a florid style. The sarcophagus containing the body is inclosed within a screen of marble, carved into lattice-work and inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Numbers of women repair to this place to pray at the tomb and implore the saint's intercession in their favour. There is also within the inclosure another tomb of elaborate workmanship, represented to contain the remains of several members of Akbar's family. To the westward of the great inclosure are the massive ruins of the palace. The stables form a long and wide street, with a portico on each side fifteen feet deep, supported with carved stone pillars in front, and roofed with enormous slabs of stone, reaching from the colonnade to the wall. The whole hill on which the palace stands bears marks of terraces and gardens, to irrigate which an elaborate succession of wells, cisterns, and wheels, appears to have been contrived adjoining the great mosque. Numerous other great and remarkable ruins are everywhere scattered over the extensive inclosure of the ancient ramparts of the town. A huge and massive gateway is particularly worth notice, on account of two figures of \"astonishing elephants,\" of the natural size, carved in stone with admirable skill and truth. At no great distance is a tower, forty or fifty feet high, built, according to local report, of elephants' tusks, but actually of composition, moulded and enamelled into a resemblance of those natural substances. Outside the town, and to the north of the hills on which it is built, is the ruined embankment, extending a circuit of twenty miles, and formed by Akbar to dam up the torrent Khari. A lake was thus made, and on its margin was built an amphitheatre with high minarets. Abulfazl continues: \"The amphitheatre is used for the game of chowgong;\"* and here also are exhibited the elephant-fights.\" The wide extent inclosed by the ruined wall of this favourite city of the greatest of the monarchs of Hindostan\n\n* Chawgan, according to Richardson, \"a game like that in Scotland called golf, but played on horseback.\" \"I have never seen a game more manly or exciting,\" observes Vigne, who gives an animated and excellent description of it.\n\n1 Bacon, ii. 363.\n2 Ayeen Akbery, ii. 45.\n3 Hunter, 76.\n4 Ayeen Akbery, ii. 46.\n5 Hodges, Travels, 120.\n\nIn v. 845.\nTravels in Kashmir, ii. 291.\nFUT.\n\nis now overspread with \"ruined houses\" and mosques, interspersed with fields cultivated with rice and mustard, and a few tamarind-trees.\" The surrounding country is fine, and its character shows the good taste of Akbar, who chose it as the scene of his gorgeous seclusion. \"The scene [from the top of the great gateway] is indeed a lovely one, extending over an immense tract of country, the horizon of which is on all sides thirty miles distant from the beholder on a clear day, such as that which we enjoyed. The low line of hills upon which the place is built is seen creeping through the whole face of the level country from east to west, crowned every here and there with ruined buildings, or a hill fortress. Among these Bhurtpore is just visible. On the opposite side is the Jumna, winding through the distance, and leading the eye to the glittering, though far-off, towers and domes of Agra. The middle distance is richly wooded, and thickly spotted with ruins of every age, and in every style of design.\" The town, though so ruinous, has at present a good bazar, and is at all times abundantly supplied with good water from wells and tanks.

The town is surrounded by a low weak rampart of stone, but the fort is rather strong, and has a roomy interior, defended by lofty ramparts, a fausse-braie, and a ditch of masonry. This was a prosperous and important place during the life of Rao Raja Luchman Singh, who resided here; but since his death it has been much deserted.

Lat. 26\u00b0 37', long. 77\u00b0 12'.\n\nFUTTEHPOOR, under the lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a British district named from its principal place. It is bounded on the north-east by the Ganges, which divides it from the kingdom of Oude; on the east by the British district of Allahabad; on the south-west by the Jumna, dividing it from the British districts Humeerpore and Banda; and on the north-west by the British district of Cawnpore. It lies between lat. 25\u00b0 25'\u201426\u00b0 13', long. 80\u00b0 12'\u201481\u00b0 23', and has an area of 1,583 square miles. The whole district is comprised within the tract called the Doab, and the two large rivers which bound it on two sides afford extensive means of inland navigation. The Ganges first touches on it at its north-eastern angle, and holding a southeasterly course of about sixty-two miles, \"leaves the district at its south-eastern angle. It has in this part a bed of the average width of four miles, \"within the limits of which it changes its course annually; in the lapse of four or five years shifting from the one to the other limit.\" The annual rise caused by the monsoon rains at the close of summer, is about thirty feet, but the river is at all times navigable for boats, and is now navigated by steamers up to Gurmuktesar, nearly 300 miles above the northern frontier, and within 100 miles of the base of the Sub-Himalayas. The navigation is, however,\n\n* According to Prinsep, upwards of \"forty.\"\n\n2 Butter, Topog. of Oudh, 11.\n\n3 Id. 10.\n\n4 Allen's Indian Mail, Oct. 4, 1846, p. 580, col. ii.\n\n1 Steam Navigation in India, 94.\ndifficult, tedious, and often vexatious, from the occurrence of shoals and rapids. The earth and sand suspended in the water cause quick wear and decay of the cocks, valves, and other parts of the engines; and so irregular is the depth of the stream, that it cannot be navigated with certainty in every part and in all seasons, except by craft drawing not more than two feet of water. The Jumna, flowing nearly parallel with the Ganges, and forming the boundary of the district on the opposite side, first touches on it at the north-western angle, and holds a meandering course of about 100 miles, generally in a south-easterly direction, until it quits the district. \"Its banks are lofty and precipitous, and ridges of rock in many places advance into the stream, combining with its general shallowness and strong current, to render navigation extremely difficult and dangerous.\" Much has been done, under the orders of the British authorities, to improve the channel, by removing shoals and blasting and clearing away rocks, and with the most beneficial result, the navigation having \"been facilitated in a degree quite extraordinary,\" but still not being safe for craft drawing above two feet water. The river is, however, highly useful as affording means of transport, though thus limited; large quantities of cotton, one of the most valuable products of the lower Doab, being sent down it, especially from Chillah Tara Ghat, a boating station about twenty miles south-west of the town of Futtehapore. Jacquemont describes the Jumna at Humeerpore, just above its contact with this district, as remarkable in the season of low water for its blue tint; as running at the rate of three or four miles an hour, with a channel half a mile wide, and a stream of 300 yards; the right bank as high, precipitous, and consisting of clay mixed with sand; the left low and level, consisting of dark alluvial earth, retaining verdure at all seasons, but cheerless, and devoid of picturesque beauty. The Rind or Urrund, a small river, passes into this district from that of Cawnpore, over the north-western boundary, and, flowing by the town of Korah, holds a course nearly southerly for thirty miles, finally falling into the Jumna on the left side. The Etawah branch of the Ganges Canal will also pass over the north-western boundary into this district, from that of Cawnpore, and, holding a south-easterly course for about fifteen miles, will join\nFUTTEHPORE.\n\nthe Jumna about twenty miles below the town of Humeerpore.\n\nThe surface of the country is remarkably level, but has a gentle declivity towards the south-east, in which direction the Jumna and Ganges flow. The elevation above the sea of the mean watermark of the Ganges, where it first touches on the district, is about 400 feet; that of the Jumna, in the corresponding part of its course, is probably twenty feet higher, as the more marked declivity of its bed is indicated by the greater rapidity of its current, and its more prolonged course to the confluence of the two rivers at Allahabad. From the level aspect of the country, it is probable that no spot within it has an elevation above the sea much exceeding 500 feet. The climate can differ little from that of southern Oude, situate on the other side of the Ganges, and at the same elevation. According to Butter, the climate of that country is characterized by great dryness, and wide range of variation in the thermometer, which sometimes rises to 112\u00b0, at others falls to 28\u00b0; the mean daily range being about 30\u00b0, and the mean temperature 74\u00b0.\n\nHeber states, that in 1824, the year in which he passed through this district, no rain had fallen as late as the beginning of October. The statement is, however, made on report, and not on personal observation. As the physical circumstances of the district are so nearly similar to those of southern Oude, the reader may refer to the article on that country for further information. The soil is fertile, and in seasons not afflicted by drought, well repays the tiller's care. Von Orlich, whose journey took place in the beginning of March, observes, \"Its peculiar freshness in this dry season was very remarkable. It is a boundless garden, in which sugarcane, indigo, cotton, poppy, wheat, barley, and many vegetables flourish. Beautiful groves of mangoes, tamarinds, and bananas overshadow the village pagodas, mosques, and tanks, and give an ever-varying beauty to the landscape, which is animated by\n\n* The elevation of Cawnpore above the sea is four hundred and ten feet, and it is twenty-five miles farther up the river than the frontier of the district. The fall of the bed of the river is about nine inches per mile, and which, in twenty-five miles, would amount to little more than eighteen feet; consequently, the elevation of the average watermark, at the upper frontier, may be taken at four hundred feet, in round numbers.\npilgrims, peasantry, travellers on foot and horseback, heavily-laden carts, and camels. Altogether, this district presents one of the most original and picturesque scenes of Indian life.\"\n\nIt may be inferred that this part of India has been much benefited by British rule, as Tennant, who travelled through it in 1798, describes it as then a melancholy waste, though exhibiting in its ruined towns, tanks, saraes, and other scattered works of utility, memorials of former prosperity. Under the existing revenue settlement of the North-Western Provinces, the government demand on the lands of this district has been fixed for a term of years, and is not liable to be increased until the year 1870.\n\nThe population is officially returned at 511,132, of which number the Hindoos form by far the larger proportion; viz., 263,194 agricultural, and 197,267 non-agricultural; while the Mussulmans amount only to 21,776 agricultural, and 28,895 non-agricultural. The number of towns containing less than 1,000 inhabitants, is 1,283; those containing more than 1,000 and less than 5,000, are 96; and there is one containing upwards of 10,000; making a total of 1,380. The principal towns\u2014Futtehpore, Korah, Kudjooa or Cujwa, Hatgang, and Huswa\u2014are noticed under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe great trunk road from Calcutta to Delhi and the northern Doab, by Allahabad, proceeds through this district, in a direction from south-east to north-west, passing through the town of Futtehpore. From this last town a route proceeds south-westward by Chillatara Ghaut to Banda; another westward to Calpee. The route from Cawnpore to Banda by Chilatara Ghat passes through the north-western part of the district in a direction from north to south.\n\nThe tract in which this district is comprised, was conquered, in 1194, by the Afghan Mussulmans, under Shahabuddin Muhammad, ruler of Ghuznee. These invaders so well established their power in this quarter, that they were able to offer an obstinate resistance to Baber, whose son Humayon they expelled, under the conduct of Sher Shah. After Akbar removed the seat of government to Agra, the adjacent part of the Doab became of great political importance, and in 1659,\n\n* Futtehpore, in pergunnah Futtehpore, has 15,414 inhabitants.\nFUTTEHPORE.\n\nAurangzebe and his brother Shuja met in conflict for sovereignty and life at Kudjooa or Cujwa, twenty miles north-west of the town of Futtehpore. After a sharp action, Shuja was routed, with the loss of 114 pieces of cannon, and the entire dispersion of his army.* By treaty dated 16th August, 1765, between the East-India Company and Shuja ud Dowlah, the nawaub of Oude, this part of the Doab was assigned to the emperor of Delhi, the fourth article providing, that \"the king, Shah Allum, shall remain in full possession of Cora, and such part of the province of Allahabad as he now possesses, which are ceded to his majesty as a royal demesne for the support of his dignity and expenses.\" Shah Allum having in 1772 given up to the Mahrattas his claims on these provinces, that step was regarded by the British authorities as amounting to a forfeiture, and they agreed by treaty of the 1st May, 1775, that this tract should remain in the possession of the nawaub of Oude,* in as full a manner as the rest of his dominions. Finally, by treaty of the 10th November, 1801, the Nawaub re-conveyed it to the Company, in commutation of the subsidy which he had stipulated to pay for the defence of his territory.\n\nFUTTEHPORE.\u2014The principal place of the district of the same name, a town on the route from Allahabad to Cawnpore, 70\u00b2 miles N.W. of the former, and 50 S.E. of the latter. It has a spacious serae or lodge for travellers, built of brick, which Heber describes as a \"large court, with two gateways opposite to each other, surmounted by towers not unlike those of a college, with a cloister or veranda all round, raised about a foot from the ground, with a pucka (baked brick) floor, and having little fire-places contrived against the wall, just large enough to hold the earthen pitchers, in which all the cookery of the country is carried on; and behind this a range of small and dark apartments, a step lower than the veranda.\" Contiguous to the serae is a well-supplied bazar. Futtehpore is a large and thriving town, with a population of 15,414 persons. It has some good houses, and a small but very elegant mosque, built by the nephew of Almas Ali Khan, a eunuch, the minister of the nawaub of Oude, farmer of the revenues of the Southern\n\n* Heber remarks that this part of the Doab seems \"marked out by nature for the scene of a great battle, which should decide the fate of the country.\"\nFUT.\n\nDoab, and \"of nearly half of the province of Oude\" at the close of the last century and commencement of the present. The environs are crowded with burial-places. Tieffenthaler, writing a century ago, describes it as having a long street, and formerly populous, but at that time much decayed. At its north-east side was a mud fort, of quadrangular outline, with a round tower at each corner. In the Ayeen Akbery, its revenue is stated to be 72,317 rupees. Here is the chief seat of the civil establishment of the district, consisting of a judge, collector, deputy-collector, and other functionaries. In the military distribution, Futtehpore is within the Benares division, and a detachment of infantry is usually stationed here.\n\nThe Arabic word fath, forming part of the name, shows that it must have been given subsequently to the overthrow of the Hindoos by the Affgan Mussulmans, under Shahabuddin, in the year 1194. The place was certainly in existence previously to the invasion of this region by Baber, as it is mentioned by him. Supplies and water may be had here in great abundance, and the road in this part of the route is good.

It has a large bazar, and contains 2,000 houses, with a population estimated at 12,000.

The road in this part of the route is heavy, and bad for wheeled carriages; the country level, and in some parts cultivated; in others, overrun with bush-jungle.

It has a bazar, and is supplied with water from wells. The road in this part of the route is rather good. Lord Valentia, who passed through this place in 1803, describes\u00b3 it as tolerably populous, and consisting of a street, inclosed by a wall of trifling height, and having at each end a gateway, the gates of which were broken. It was built\u2074 by Shuja ud daulah, nawaub vizier of Oude, in commemoration of a victory gained over the Rohillas; and hence the name.

Tiefenthaler\u00b3 describes it as consisting, in his time, about a century ago, of two parts. It is now of somewhat less importance than during the period from the first establishment of the cantonment, in 1777,\u2074 to the beginning of the present century, when the dubious political relations of the East-India Company with the state of Oude, and the proximity of the Mahratta\n\n* Victor-market; from Fath, \"victory,\" and Ganj, \"market.\"\n+ Properly Fathgar\u2014Fort-victory; from Fath, \"victory,\" and Garh, \"fort.\"\npower under Perron, required considerable military resources to be promptly available in this part of India. It is a favourite station with the military, being healthful, and abundantly supplied with a variety of excellent provisions at a cheap rate. The consequence of this station is likely to be increased on the completion of the projected branch of the Ganges Canal, which, issuing from the main channel on the left side, a little north of Meerut, is continued for the distance of 170 miles to Futtyghur. There is a church at this place. Holcar, in the course of his incursion into the Dooab in 1804, attacked the town, burned the cavalry stables and the officers' bungalows, and was proceeding to attack the defences, when the arrival of the British, and his consequent defeat, drove him into precipitate flight. The cantonment is 25 miles to the E. of the great route from Calcutta to Delhi, and 703 miles N.W. of the former, 184 S.E. of the latter. Elevation above the sea 550 feet.

Its site is picturesque, among the low hills forming the southern boundary of the valley of the Nerbudda, and it is a place of some importance, as three petty Gond rajas or chiefs reside there.

Fyzabad, and the ruins of the ancient Ayodha or Oude, adjoining it on the south-east, extend ten miles along the right bank of the river, and for a distance of two miles from it. Saadat Ali Khan, first nawaub vazir of Oude, and who may be considered the founder of this town, about the year 1730 built here a palace, and adjoining to it laid out a handsome garden, in the Persian style. It was further embellished by his successors Sefdar Jang and Shujah ud daulah with various buildings and pleasure-grounds. The latter enlarged the market-place, strengthened the fort with a wall, a ditch, and round towers, and collected so great a population, that it became a great city. Subsequently, however, on his acquisition of a large part of Rohilcund, he removed the seat of government to Lucknow. This took place in 1775, and since that time Fyzabad has much decayed, the present population consisting almost exclusively of the lower and more indigent classes, the leading men, merchants, bankers, and others, having transferred their residence to Lucknow. The tide of emigration, which is represented as constantly increasing, is accelerated by the exactions practised on the inhabitants. Everything brought into the town is heavily taxed. The chief manufactures at present are cloth, metal vessels, and arms. The population is estimated by Butter at 100,000, but is fast diminishing, from the numbers of those who seek an asylum from oppression in the Company's territories, or wherever else peace and security may be enjoyed.\n\nThe military route from Goruckpore cantonment to that of Lucknow passes through this place, crossing the river Gogra by ferry at the Rai ghat, where are usually many boats.

The number of its houses is stated by Buchanan at 115, which, allowing six persons to each house, would give a population of 690.

It was then believed that the Jahnuvi took its rise from the north of the culminating range of the Himalayas, within the limits of Chinese authority.\u00b3 This supposition turns out, however, to be erroneous. It has been since ascertained\u2074 that the remotest source of the Jahnuvi is situate in British territory, on the southern base of the before-mentioned range; and in reference to this discovery, Captain Strachey, to whom its merit is due, contends that the Ganges should be considered to originate in the most distant tributary of the Aluknunda (a feeder of the Ganges having a larger volume of water than the Bhageerettee). But as the distance between the ascertained source of the most remote tributary of the Bhageerettee and the point of confluence of the latter river with the Aluknunda is still believed to be fully equal to the distance between the source of the\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C.

The Bhageerettee first comes to light near Gangotri, in the territory of Gurwhal, in lat. $80^\\circ 54'$, long. $79^\\circ 7'$, issuing from under a very low arch, at the base of a great snow-bed, estimated to be 300 feet thick, which lies between the lofty mountains termed St. Patrick, St. George, and the Pyramid, the two higher having elevations above the sea, respectively, of 22,798 and 22,654 feet, and the other, on the opposite side, having an elevation of 21,379.\n\n\"From the brow of this curious wall of snow, and immediately above the outlet of the stream, large and hoary icicles depend. They are formed by the freezing of the melted snow-water at the top of the bed; for in the middle of the day the sun is powerful, and the water produced by its action falls over this place in cascade, but is frozen at night.\" As in Brahminical mythology, the Ganges is said to flow from the head of Mahadeva or Siva, a Hindoo who attended the English party by whom this place was explored, expressed his belief that these icicles must be the hair of the deity. On the 31st May the mean breadth of the stream was found to be twenty-seven feet; the mean depth was estimated at fifteen inches. From this spot, which has an elevation of 13,800 feet, the stream holds a direction north-west for ten miles to Gangotri, where the mean breadth, on the 26th May, was found to be forty-three feet, the depth eighteen inches, and the current very rapid. On the 2nd June the stream was ascertained to be two feet deep, and wider than previously observed. The elevation of Gangotri is 10,300 feet, and the average descent of the river thereto, from the place where it emerges from the snow-bed, is 350 feet per mile. From Gangotri the Bhageerettee holds a course nearly north-west to Bhairogati, in lat. $31^\\circ 2'$, long. $78^\\circ 54'$, the point of confluence with the Jahnuvi, holding its steep and foaming course from the north-east. The latter is considerably the larger river. The distance is seven miles from Gangotri to Bhairogati; and as this latter place has an elevation of 8,511 feet, the average descent of the river in this part of its course is 255 per mile. The united stream holds\nGANGES.\n\na course first westerly, and then south-westerly, for thirteen miles, as far as Sookhee, in lat. $30^\\circ 59'$, long. $78^\\circ 45'$, where it may be said to \"break through the Himalaya Proper.\" The elevation of the waterway is here 7,608 feet,* and consequently, the descent of the stream from the confluence is on an average seventy feet per mile. From Sookhee the river holds a very sinuous but generally a south-westerly course, for about thirty-six miles, to Utal, in lat. $30^\\circ 43'$, long. $78^\\circ 25'$, where it turns nearly southward for about fifteen miles more to Surota, in lat. $30^\\circ 33'$, long. $78^\\circ 24'$. It thence takes a direction south-east, and, at a distance of nine miles, in lat. $30^\\circ 28'$, long. $78^\\circ 29'$, receives, on the left side, the Julkar, a considerable torrent flowing from the north-east; and eight miles lower down, on the same side, at Teeree, in lat. $30^\\circ 23'$, long. $78^\\circ 31'$, the Bhilung, another tributary of considerable size, also flowing from the north-east. The elevation of the waterway at this confluence is 2,278 feet,* and the average descent of the river from Sookhee thereto is seventy-eight feet per mile. Continuing to flow south-east for twenty-two miles, it is, at Deoprag, in lat. $30^\\circ 8'$, long. $78^\\circ 39'$, joined on the left side by the Aluknunda, a large stream formed by the union of the Vishnoo and the Doulee. The Aluknunda is a larger river than that whose volume it contributes to swell, bearing to it the proportion of three to two. The elevation at the point of this confluence is 1,953 feet,* and consequently the average descent of the river from Teeree to it is fifteen feet in the mile. From Deoprag, the united stream, now called the Ganges, flows southwards eight miles, to Nougaon, in lat. $30^\\circ 3'$, long. $78^\\circ 38'$, where, on the left side, it receives the Nyar, a considerable stream flowing from the south-east. From this confluence the river holds a course very sinuous, but generally westerly, for twenty-four miles, to Rikkee Kasee, in lat. $30^\\circ 6'$, long. $78^\\circ 23'$, where it touches upon the Dehra Dhoon. Rikkee Kasee having an elevation of 1,377 feet,* the fall of the river to that place from Deoprag is on an average eighteen feet per mile. In its passage between the Dehra Dhoon and the province of Kumaon,\n\n* The height of Sookhee is given in Walker's Map at 8,869 feet; but the river bed was found by barometer 1,261 feet below Sookhee, or above the sea 7,608.\nGANGES.\n\nit receives, opposite the village of Kankur, in lat. 30\u00b0 2', long. 78\u00b0 19', on the right bank, the Sooswa, a considerable stream, draining the valley, down which it flows in a south-easterly direction. This is the only stream of importance which falls into the Ganges on the right side, from the confluence of the Jahnuvi to this part of its course, though it receives numerous small torrents on that side. Its descent by the Dehra Dhoon is rather rapid to Hurdwar, in lat. 29\u00b0 57', long. 78\u00b0 14', a distance from Rikkee Kasee of fifteen miles, in a south-westerly direction. The elevation of Hurdwar is 1,024 feet; consequently, the average descent of the river in passing the Dehra Dhoon is twenty-three feet per mile. The volume of water discharged at Hurdwar when the river is lowest is estimated at 7,000 cubic feet per second; being equal to only a small part of the alleged volume of the Dihong or Sanpoo, the principal feeder of the Brahmapootra.\n\nFrom Hurdwar, the general course of the Ganges is nearly south for about 130 miles, as far as Anopshuhur, in the British district of Bolundshuhur, in lat. 28\u00b0 31', long. 78\u00b0 20', where it turns to the south-east, and 160 miles lower down, in lat. 27\u00b0 7', long. 80\u00b0 3', receives on the left side the Ramgunga, a considerable river flowing from the north-west. Eight miles lower down, it on the right side receives the Kallee Nuddee, flowing likewise from the north-west; and twenty miles beyond, the Eesun Nuddee. One hundred and seventy miles lower down, at Allahabad, in lat. 25\u00b0 26', long. 81\u00b0 45', it is joined, also on the right side, by the Jumna, from the north-west. From Hurdwar to Cawnpore, the distance is about 348 miles: as the descent of the river from the former to the latter place is about 645 feet, the average fall of the river in this part of its course is about one foot ten inches per mile; and as there does not appear to be any marked difference in the declivity of its channel between Cawnpore and Allahabad, the same average descent of the waterway may, with probability, be assumed for the whole distance from Hurdwar to Allahabad. Throughout the whole of its course above Allahabad, the Ganges is \"a stream of shoals and rapids.\" There are fords across it; as at Sakertal, in lat. 29\u00b0 29', long. 78\u00b0 4'; at Ahar, seven miles above Anopshuhur; at Kumurooddeennuggur, in lat. 28\u00b0 55',\nlong. 78\u00b0 11\u2032; in the vicinity of Hurdwar; and without doubt in other places at times, when the water is very low. It is, however, navigable for river craft as far as Hurdwar; steamers conveying passengers and treasure, ply as far as Ghurmukteesur, 393 miles above Allahabad; and as far as Cawnpore, 140 miles above Allahabad, the navigation is plied with much activity, the reach of the river at that military station having the appearance of a port on a small scale. From Allahabad, the stream meanders in a direction generally easterly for 270 miles, to Manjhee, near which, in lat. 25\u00b0 46\u2032, long. 84\u00b0 40\u2032, it is joined on the left side by the Gogra. Between Allahabad and Manjhee, it on the left side receives the Goomtee, and on the right, the Tons and Kurumnassa; besides many smaller streams right and left. The average breadth in this part during the dry season is from 1,200 to 1,500 feet. At Benares, at that season, a section of the river is set down as having a breadth of 1,400 feet, and an average depth of thirty-five feet, and the discharge was estimated at 19,000 cubic feet per second. During the periodical rains, the breadth of the river at the same spot is 3,000 feet, and, rising forty-three feet, its average depth is about fifty-eight feet. The mean discharge at Benares throughout the year is estimated at 250,000 cubic feet per second. The depth of the channel is, however, subject to great inequality, in many places exceeding fifty feet during the periodical rains; while, in the dry season, it was found that near Kutchwa, thirty-five miles above Benares, a shoal extends completely across the river, having only two feet six inches water on its lowest part; so that all craft having a draught exceeding two feet, grounded in attempting to pass; and it is obvious, that at this spot the river must be then fordable. Eighteen miles below the junction of the Gogra, opposite to the town of Cherand, in lat. 25\u00b0 39\u2032, long. 84\u00b0 53\u2032, it on the right side receives the Sone, a large river flowing from the south-west; and after this addition, \u201cits channel, when clear of islands, is generally about a mile wide; but in spring by far the greater part is a mere dry sand, covered with clouds of dust, which render all objects at any distance invisible; so that, travelling on its channel, one might imagine himself in the midst of a frightful desert.\u201d At Hajeepoor, on the\nleft side, twenty miles below the confluence of the Sone, the Ganges receives the Gunduck, a large river from the north-west, and continues to flow eastward for 160 miles, to Kuttree, in lat. 25\u00b0 20', long. 87\u00b0 17', where, on the left side, it receives the Coosy, also a large river flowing from the north, having in its course between the junctions of these two great rivers received right and left several streams of less importance. Below the confluence, for thirty-five miles, to Sikregali, situate in lat. 25\u00b0 10', long. 87\u00b0 43', numerous tributaries from the north pour their waters into the Ganges; yet such is the enormous loss by evaporation, that, two miles below the above-mentioned place, the river, though a mile wide, has only five feet of water where deepest, with a current of only a mile and a quarter per hour; and so shallow in several places is the stream, that craft should have a \"draught\" little exceeding eighteen inches, to navigate safely and beneficially between Calcutta and Allahabad.\" At Sikregali the river turns south-east, a direction which the main stream continues to hold for the remainder of its course; but sixty miles below Sikregali, and opposite the town of Seebgunge, in lat. 24\u00b0 44', long. 87\u00b0 59', the Bhagarathi, a great watercourse, parts on the right side from the main stream; and seventy miles lower down, the Jellinghee, another watercourse, also of considerable dimensions, diverges on the same side, at the town of Jellinghee, in lat. 24\u00b0 9', long. 88\u00b0 40'. The Bhagarathi proceeding southward for 120 miles, is then rejoined by the Jellinghee, after a course of about the like distance, and the united stream, called the Hoogly, continuing to hold the same direction for forty-eight miles, becomes navigable for vessels of considerable burthen at Chandernagore, in lat. 22\u00b0 50', long. 88\u00b0 21', at the distance of 115 miles from the sea, into which it falls about lat. 21\u00b0 40', long. 88\u00b0; its estuary being considered by the Brahminists the termination of the sacred stream, which, rising near Gangotri, and issuing from the mountains at Hurdwar, flows by the holy city of Benares. Its total length of course, from the source of the Jahnuvi to its fall into the Bay of Bengal at Saugor, is about 1,514 miles,* viz.:\u2014\n\n* The distance, reckoned from the snow-bed of Gangotri, would reduce the length of the river by about thirteen miles.\nGANGES.\n\nFrom the source of the Jahnuvi to the junction of the Aluknunda and Bhagerettee rivers ........................................... 133\nThence to Hurdwar ........................................................................ 47\n,, Allahabad .................................................................................. 488\n,, Seebgunge (origin of the Bhagirathi) ....................... 568\n,, Junction of Bhagirathi with Jellinghee ...... 120\n,, Chandernagore ............................................................................ 48\n,, The Sea ...................................................................................... 115\n\n1,514\n\nBelow the divergence of the Bhagirathi and the Jellinghee, the main stream is called the Podda or Ganges; and from that point the joint delta of the Ganges and Brahmapootra may be considered to commence. The Podda or Ganges, flowing south-east, receives some considerable streams on the left side; and on the right, besides the Jellinghee, it throws off, five miles lower down, the Martabhang; forty miles below this latter divergence, the Gorae; and forty miles still further, the Chundni. At the distance of thirty miles lower down, it is joined on the left side, at Juffergunge, in lat. 23\u00b0 52', long. 89\u00b0 45', by an offset of the Konaie or Jabuna, a vast river, the principal channel of the Brahmapootra, and here much larger than the Podda or Ganges. The united stream takes a course south-east for sixty miles, when it throws off the Kirtynassa, and sixty-five miles below that divergence, it joins the Meghna, after which, flowing southwards for thirty-five miles, it is finally discharged into the Bay of Bengal, in lat. 22\u00b0 15', long. 90\u00b0 48'; its total length of course, from the issue beneath the snow at Gangotri, being 1,557 miles, or from the source of the Jahnuvi, 1,570 miles. In continuation of what has been already stated as to the slope of the river down to Allahabad, it may be mentioned that Prinsep estimated the fall, in a distance of 139* miles (measured along the continuous course of the stream), from that city to Benares, at six inches per mile; from Benares to Colgong, being 326 miles, at five inches; from Colgong to\n\n* In Prinsep's volume, the distance from Allahabad to Benares is said to be only twenty-nine miles, and that between Jellinghee and Calcutta ninety-seven miles; statements so greatly at variance with fact, that they must be presumed to be errors of the press.\nGANGES.\n\nJellinghee, being 167 miles, at four inches; from Jellinghee to Calcutta, being 170 miles, also at four inches; from Calcutta to the sea, about 100 miles, at one or two inches, according as the water may be at its highest or lowest state.\n\nAccess at all seasons for any considerable craft from the sea to that part of the Ganges above the Delta can be attained only through the continuous channel of the Meghna and Podda, or through the Chundna, which, diverging from the Podda or Ganges on the right side, in lat. $23^\\circ 55'$, long. $89^\\circ 6'$, takes a direction southwards, and falls into the Bay of Bengal by the Hooringottah estuary. During the dry season, neither the Bhagirathi nor the Jellinghee, forming by their junction the Hoogly, is navigable for craft drawing above eighteen inches water; and at that period the communication by water between the Hoogly below Calcutta and the Ganges above the Delta, is maintained by a circuitous course called the Soonderbund Passage, opening into the Chundna. In the Podda or Ganges the tide is felt as far as Juffergunge, $160^*$ miles from the sea, and in the Hoogly to a distance of about 150 miles from the sea. Besides the principal channels,\u2014the Hoogly, the Podda, and the Chundna, numerous streams of less importance, parting from the main ones, find their way to the Bay of Bengal through the Soonderbunds, a wonderful maze of sea-islands, separated by numerous channels holding every direction, but principally from north to south. There are upwards of twenty of the estuaries of those channels opening into the head of the bay. The water of the Ganges begins to rise towards the end of May, and is usually at its maximum in September. The following table, drawn up by Captain Thomas Prinsep, illustrates the rise of the water in the river at various places:\n\n| Greatest known Annual Rise | Ft. In. | Rise in low Seasons | Ft.

Husbandry and grazing are both suspended, and the peasant traverses in his boat those fields which in another season he was wont to plough, happy that the elevated site of the river-banks places the herbage they contain within his reach, otherwise his cattle must perish.\" Many extensive tracts are guarded from being inundated by the river by means of dams, made at an enormous expense, and having collectively a length of above 1,000 miles. With respect to the general breadth of the Ganges, Prinsep states it to be \"very unequal, but may be reckoned to average a mile in the dry season on its whole course through the plains, and two miles in the freshes.\"\n\nAccording to Burnes, the average discharge of the Indus is four times that of the Ganges during the dry season. Like other rivers subject to periodical inundations, the water of the Ganges carries down earth in a state of suspension. The amount of solid matter in bulk in proportion to the quantity of water, is, according to laborious observations and calculations made by the Rev. R. Everest, as follows:\u2014During the rainy season $\\frac{1}{85}$th part,* or about two cubic inches in a\n\n* Rennell's statement on this point is quite astonishing: \"A glass of water taken out of the Ganges, when at its height, yields about one part in four of mud.\"\nGANGES.\n\ncubic foot; during the winter five months, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)th part; and during the rest of the year, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)th part; and following out his data, this writer concludes the total annual discharge of earthy matter to be 6,368,077,440 cubic feet in bulk. The total extent of inland navigation connected with the Ganges is not ascertainable with any degree of accuracy, but is unquestionably very large, and will be considerably increased on the completion of the works now in progress for facilitating the irrigation of the Doab by means of the Ganges Canal, and at the same time adding to the means of water-transit. The first idea of a plan of irrigation for the Doab originated as long since as the time of Lord William Bentinck,\\(^4\\) by whose orders some steps were taken for ascertaining its practicability; but, upon inquiry, the project did not appear capable of being successfully carried out. Under Lord Auckland the inquiries were resumed, the importance of the subject having been painfully pressed upon the notice of government by the occurrence of severe famine in the districts which the proposed works were designed to benefit. A magnificent plan for irrigation and navigation was laid down by Captain Cautley, comprising a main trunk line, running from the town of Hurdwar, through the centre of the Doab, with a connecting line to Cawnpore, as the inlet and outlet for navigation; the tracts of country lying between the different rivers which run into the Jumna and Ganges being irrigated by branches, extending the benefits of this fertilizing process to every village in the Doab.\\(^5\\)\n\nThis project was subsequently referred to a committee of engineer and artillery officers\\(^6\\) for examination and report. Their testimony was highly favourable. The only serious difficulty to the execution of the project was presented by the tract of low land through which the drainage of the Solani river runs before its junction with the Rutmoo. Two methods of surmounting this were suggested: one by an aqueduct; the other by diverting the line so as to cross the Solani and its tributaries by means of dams. The latter was recommended by its being presumed to be less costly; but the former plan, deemed far better in every other point of view, was finally adopted. An account of this magnificent aqueduct will be found under the article \"Solani River.\" The Ganges Canal is now rapidly advancing to completion. The main line has been\n\n\\(^4\\) Cautley, Report on Central Doab Canal, i.\n\n\\(^5\\) Cautley, ut supra.\n\n\\(^6\\) Report of Special Committee, 1842.\nGAN.\n\nconstructed from Hurdwar to the vicinity of Allyghur, whence it diverges in two channels, one to Cawnpore, and the other to Humeerpoor, via Etawa, with three offsets, designated the Futtehghur, Bolundshuhur, and Coel branches. The total length\\(^7\\) of the canal with all its branches will measure about 810 miles.\n\n| Route                          | Miles |\n|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Hurdwar to Allyghur           | 180   |\n| Allyghur to Cawnpore          | 170   |\n| Allyghur to Humeerpoor        | 180   |\n| Branch to Futtehghur          | 170   |\n| Ditto to Bolundshuhur         | 60    |\n| Ditto to Coel                 | 50    |\n| **Total**                     | **810** |\n\nThe total cost is estimated at a million and a half sterling. No inconvenient diminution of the navigable facilities of the Ganges is anticipated from the abstraction of the larger portion of its waters at Hurdwar for the purposes of the canal, inasmuch as no such result has taken place on the Jumna, where the whole apparent stream has been diverted to feed the two canals diverging from that river. Notwithstanding this, the under-current which percolates the gravelly or sandy bed, together with the drainage of the intermediate country, furnishes a navigable stream of water at Agra, a distance of 290 miles by the river's course; and it is thence inferred that the navigation of the Ganges below Cawnpore will not be injuriously affected; while the navigation above will be carried on by means of the canal. It may be observed, that the discharge of the Ganges at Hurdwar, the place at which it emerges from the hills, is in the dry season in proportion to that of the Jumna as seven to three, the discharge of the Ganges being estimated at 7,000 cubic feet per second, and that of the Jumna at the canal heads at about 3,000.\n\nGANGLUNG.\u2014See GANTUNG.\n\nGANGOONDOUM.\u2014A town in the British district of Madura, presidency of Madras, 274 miles S.W. of Madras.

The river here expands a little, and on the bank of a small bay or inlet the temple is built, about fifteen feet above the water. It is in a small inclosure, surrounded by a wall of unhewn stone, cemented with lime-mortar, and has close to it, and in the same inclosure, a small comfortable house, built for the officiating Brahmins. The temple is a square building, about twenty feet high, and contains small statues of Ganga, Bhagirathi, and other mythological personages, supposed to be connected with this locality. There is no village here, the pilgrims having no other shelter than a few sheds of wood, and caves in the adjoining cliffs. There are several pools, called by the names Brahmakund, Bishnukund, and others of corresponding import. Ablution in these is considered an important part of the ritual to be observed by pilgrims who visit this spot, considered popularly to be the source of the Ganges, as farther progress up the stream is generally, though erroneously, regarded as impracticable. Though this ablution, with due donations to the officiating Brahmins, is considered to cleanse from all offences, the number of pilgrims is not considerable, in consequence of the great length and ruggedness of the journey, and the difficulty of obtaining subsistence by the way. Flasks and similar vessels are filled at Gangotri with the sacred water of the stream, and being sealed by the officiating Brahmin, are conveyed to the plains, where they are highly prized by the superstitious. Gangotri is below the upper limit of forests; cedars growing here, though to no great size, and birch-trees thriving remarkably. The mean breadth of the Bhageerettee or Ganges here was ascertained by Hodgson, on the 26th of May, to be forty-three feet, the depth eighteen inches, the current very swift, and over rounded stones. On the 2nd of June following, he conjectured its volume to be doubled, in consequence of the rapid melting of the snow. Rennell's account of Gangotri would scarcely have been expected from one who usually displays so much information and judgment. \"This great body of water [the Ganges] now...\"\nforces a passage through the ridge of Mount Himmaleh, at the distance possibly of 100 miles below the place of its first approach to it, and, sapping its very foundations, rushes through a cavern, and precipitates itself into a vast basin, which it has worn in the rock at the hither foot of the mountains. The Ganges thus appears to incurious spectators to derive its original springs from this chain of mountains, and the mind of superstition has given to the mouth of the cavern the form of the head of a cow.\" The Brahmin who showed the holy places to Fraser, ridiculed the fancy that the stream issued from a rock like a cow's mouth. Herbert estimates the length of course of the Bhageerettee or Ganges, from its source near Gangotri to its entrance on the plains of Hindostan, at about 203 miles. The elevation of the temple above the sea is 10,319 feet.

The latest available reports give a very unfavourable account of the state of the country, which is little better than a great jungle, giving shelter to vast numbers of wild animals, and affording admirable sport to the hunter. The soil is naturally rich, but there is little cultivation, and not even the semblance of any administration of justice. The annual revenue was supposed to be about a lac of rupees (10,000l.), and the British tribute, which is only 500 rupees, was regularly paid. The prince, at the date of the report, though a young man, was sunk into that condition of sloth and imbecility which almost invariably results from indulgence in opium. The population is believed to be about 112,000.\n\nGANISCOTTEE.\u2014A town in the native state of Hyderabad, or territory of the Nizam, 85 miles N.E. from Hyderabad, and 204 miles S.E. from Ellichpoor.

It is bounded on the north-west, north, and north-east, by the territory of Orissa; on the south-east by the Bay of Bengal; on the west by the British district of Vizagapatam; and lies between lat. $18^\\circ 13'$\u2014$19^\\circ 52'$, long. $83^\\circ 50'$\u2014$85^\\circ 15'$. The area is stated officially to be 6,400 square miles. The seacoast, commencing at the estuary of the Naglaudi Nadi, or Chicacole river, is bold and rocky, and is marked by a range of rugged hills, running in some parts close to the shore; in others, nearly parallel to it, but a few miles inland. Those about lat. $19^\\circ 25'$, long. $85^\\circ 8'$, near the northern extremity of the coast, recede gradually from it, and leave space for an extensive sandy plain, partly occupied by the jhil or lake of Chilka, lying between this district and that of Cuttack, and separated from the sea for many miles by a long narrow strip of sand, seldom more than three hundred yards in breadth. Though coasting vessels may enter the river Rasikoila, in lat. $19^\\circ 22'$, long. $85^\\circ 8'$, there is throughout the whole extent of coast no haven for ships of any considerable burthen, which, if trading to places on any part of it, must anchor abreast of them in the open sea. Landwards of the rocky hills extending along the coast, the country for a few miles expands into a plain, beyond which, in the north-west of the district, are numerous intricate rocky groups and ranges, which ultimately, beyond the western boundary, become connected with the great range of the Eastern Ghauts. Their geological formation is generally primitive, principally gneiss and granite. The streams of the district flow from those hills, and hold a course south-eastward, falling into the Bay of Bengal. The principal are, the Naglaudi or Chicacole river, debouching in lat. $18^\\circ 13'$, long. $84^\\circ$; the Callingapatam river, debouching about twelve miles farther to the north-east; and the Rasikoila; but all, without exception, are mere torrents, which are dry for a part of the year.

Topography and Statistics of Northern Division of Madras Army, 70.\nGANJAM.\n\nChilka, the greater part of which lies within the limits of the British district of Cuttack, touches part of the northern frontier of this district. It is about forty-two miles in length from north to south, and fifteen in breadth; of small depth, its greatest not exceeding six feet, while in most parts it has not more than four. It abounds in fish and aquatic birds, and is valuable from the great quantity of culinary salt obtained from its water through evaporation in shallow tanks, by means of the heat of the sun. The hot season comprises the latter end of March, and the months of April and May, during which the temperature is very high, and the air oppressive. The south-west monsoon sets in about the middle of June, and continues until October, when it is succeeded by a variable season, ushering in the north-east monsoon, which brings cool weather, that continues through the winter months, and renders them bracing and salubrious. During the hot season, and the close of the rainy one, agues and fevers of very bad type are common; and in 1815 these diseases carried off such great numbers, both of the European and native population, at the town of Ganjam, that the civil and military establishments were removed to Chicacole; and the former place has since been nearly deserted.\n\nThere is very scanty information respecting the zoology of the district, which, however, is represented as comprehending the bear, the chita or hunting-leopard, the hyena, the jackal, the tiger-cat, and the hare.\n\nThe level country is in general extremely fertile, producing abundant crops of rice, sugarcane, maize, millet, pulse of various kinds, oil-seeds, and raji (Eleusine corocana); while the hilly country yields wax, lac, gums, dye-stuffs, arrowroot, and great variety of timber and ornamental woods. Cotton is produced annually to a considerable extent; and the local demand is such as to leave scarcely any for exportation. The only manufactures of importance are coarse cotton cloths and muslins, which last were formerly in high esteem and extensively manufactured, but are not now produced to the same extent, on account of the diminished demand consequent on the irresistible competition of British fabrics. The population has been stated officially to be 926,930, an amount which, compared with the area, indicates a relative density of 145 to the square mile.\nGAN.\n\nsquare mile. By far the greater part are Brahminists, there being few Mussulmans, and probably no Christians, except those in the service of government. The former prevalence, and recent suppression of human sacrifices in a part of Ganjam, are briefly noticed in the article Goomsoor. Ganjam occupies the northern portion of the territory known as the Five Circars, the possession of which was an object of fierce contention between the French and English about the middle of the last century. They were obtained by the former in 1753, and continued under their dominion for six years, when Clive transferred them to the East-India Company, to whom they were formally ceded in 1765, by the emperor of Delhi.6\n\nChicacole, the principal place of the district, Ganjam and Russelkondah, the towns of note within the district, are described under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe great route from north-east to south-west, from Calcutta to Madras, runs through the whole length of the district parallel to the seacoast, and generally at a short distance from it. The construction of a macadamized road from Berhampore to Russelkondah has been authorized, at the estimated cost of 14,224l.6\n\nGANJAM,1 in the British district of the same name, presidency of Madras, a town on the left side of the Rosikoila Nuddee, immediately above its fall into the Bay of Bengal.2 This town, formerly remarkable for its fine buildings, is now much decayed, the fort and cantonments being in ruins, and the place nearly deserted, in consequence of a deadly epidemic fever, which, in 1815, carried3 off great numbers of the inhabitants, both Europeans and natives. The civil and military stations were then removed to the town of Chicacole. The insalubrity of the situation has, it is said, passed away; but the establishments which formerly caused its prosperity, have not been restored. It has still, however, some coasting trade4 by means of the river. Distance direct from Chicacole, N.E., 110 miles; Vizagapatam, N.E., 165; Madras, N.E., 536; Cuttack, S.W., 90; Calcutta, S.W., 315.

Jacquemont\\(^1\\) describes it as a vast opening between summits which overtop it about a thousand feet. The highest part of the pass is covered with perpetual snow. To the west, a declivity extends towards the distant Sutluj, with a surface sloping gradually, but inexpressibly rugged. Nature in few places assumes a form more frightful than that here described by Gerard:\\(^2\\)\u2014\"We now hurried down to a milder climate, for a short way upon continuous snow, and afterwards on loose rock and snow for a mile, where the head of the dell is formed on each side of us. In this plain of wrecks and horrid scenery, the detached summits of the chain rose in various misshapen forms, dark and naked on their sides, but terminating in spires and domes of perpetual whiteness. Around their bases, which here rest at an elevation of 17,000 feet, are enormous accumulations of snow, containing basins of still water, the dread of travellers who approach them: the scene surpasses description. The dell, nearly half a mile wide, is covered by layers of broken stones, exhibiting extraordinary variety, beautiful to the eye, but severe to the feet.\" The space to be traversed devoid of wood for fuel is eight miles, and, in consequence of this, the pass is little frequented. Gerard crossed it, at the end of July, amidst falls of snow and sleet, which lasted all day, yet so mild was the temperature, comparatively with the enormous elevation, that the thermometer did not sink below $33^\\circ$.\n\nGantung, geologically, has some interest, as there the slate formation,\\(^4\\) reaching westward towards the Sutluj, crops out from beneath the calcareous and fossiliferous strata extending eastward.

The fort is at the apex of the angle, and is of irregular ground-plan, being washed on two sides by the confluent streams. The interior wall of the fort is thirty feet high, and of thickness varying from six to twenty feet; an outer wall, twenty feet high, surrounds the place, the interval between the two defences being very irregular. A ditch thirty feet deep communicates with both rivers, and, extending between them, strengthens the defences towards the country. The town, which extends from river to river, is separated from the fort by a considerable space of waste ground. In October, 1818, it was held by a garrison for the raja of Nagpoor or Berar, and being invested by a British force under General Watson, in a few days a practicable breach was made, and the place surrendered.

It was, in a remote period, built by a sovereign of Oude, of the Bhar race, a low caste of Hindoos, and the stone used in its construction was, according to tradition, brought by water from Nepal. It early fell into the hands of the Patan invaders of Hindostan, who destroyed the upper part of the walls, leaving them standing to the height of eight or ten feet. The ruined portion has been restored, partly in brick, partly in mud. Part of the stone wall rises from the bed of the Goomtee, and exhibits many sculptures, as well as inscriptions, some in the Nagari, some in the Persian character, relating the history of the place.

These territories extend from lat. 25\u00b0 to 26\u00b0 6', and from long. 90\u00b0 7' to 92\u00b0 11'. The whole tract contains an area of 4,347 square miles. The chief divisions, with the statistical particulars of each, as far as they can be ascertained, are as follows. The Garrows contain by estimation an area of 2,268 square miles; Ram Rye, 328; Nurtung, 360; Muriow, 288; Molyong, 110; Mahram, 162; Osimla, 350; Kyrim and the domains of various petty chiefs, 486. The population of the whole is given at 65,205. The various chiefs who exercise dominion throughout this district are under the protection of the British government, though not tributary thereto. With many of them there are agreements defining the relative positions of the protecting state and the protected dependency; and with regard to all, this relation is understood and acted upon. The character of the country is wild, as is also that of the people; but for some years past the just and liberal policy of the British government has secured the general prevalence of tranquillity; but in 1852, it was deemed necessary to depute Lieutenant Agnew into the Garrow Hills to inquire into a local disturbance. The portion of this district which is directly British has been noticed under the head \"Cossyah Hills.\"\n\nGAR YARSA.\u2014A town in the native state of Cashmeer, or dominions of Gholab Sing, 202 miles N.E. from Simla, and 177 miles N.E. from Dehra.

It is situate on a range of inconsiderable eminences, extending along the east or left bank of the Bhagruttee, a watercourse formerly the main channel of the Ganges, but now containing a small portion only of its stream. The best description of this vast monument of the industry and resources of India at a remote period, is that given by Rennell, who visited the place. \"Taking the extent of the ruins of Gour at the most reasonable calculation, it is not less than fifteen miles in length (extending along the old bank of the Ganges), and from two to three in breadth. Several villages stand on part of its site; the remainder is either covered with thick forests, the habitations of tigers and other beasts of prey, or become arable land, whose soil is chiefly composed of brick-dust. The principal ruins are a mosque, lined with black marble elaborately wrought, and two gates of the citadel, which are strikingly grand and lofty. These fabrics, and some few others, appear to owe their duration to the nature of their materials, which are less marketable, and more difficult to separate, than those of the ordinary brick buildings, which have been, and continue to be, an article of merchandise, and are transported to Moorshedabad, Mauldah, and other places, for the purposes of building. These bricks are of remarkably solid texture, and have preserved the sharpness of their edges and smoothness of their surfaces through a series of ages. The situation of Gour was highly convenient for the capital of Bengal and Bahar as united under one government, being nearly centrical with respect to the populous parts of those provinces, and near the junction of the principal rivers that compose that extraordinary inland navigation for which those provinces are famed; and, moreover, secured by the Ganges and other rivers on the only quarter from which Bengal has any cause of apprehension.\" A beautiful minaret, ninety feet high and twenty-one in diameter, yet remains, surmounted by an open cupola, accessible by internal stairs, and affording a fine view of the surrounding country. There are also some mosques in a state of decay, but still retaining traces.\n\n1 Col. 1470.\n2 Sanskrit Dict. 303.\n3 Mem. on Map of Hindostan, 55.\n4 Supplement to Glossary, 355.\n\n* Gaur of Shakespear; Gaur of Wilson; Gowr of Brigge's Index; Gour of Rennell; Gour of Elliot.\nGAUR.\n\nof their original architectural excellence. Of these the most worth notice are the Sonahla Masjit, or golden mosque; the Chhota Sonahla Masjit, or small golden mosque; and the Kadam Rosul, to which votaries throng in the belief that it contains the impression on stone of the footstep of Mahomet, the founder of Islam. Of the numerous bridges formerly traversing the watercourses in and about this wonderful collection of dwellings, one only remains. So vast has been the quantity of building materials drawn from those ruins, as to give rise to a specific phrase* in the fiscal language of India. Their further abstraction has been prohibited, and measures have been taken for arresting\u2020 the destruction of the interesting antiquities in the vicinity of the ancient capital of Bengal. Splendid views of the most striking of those objects have been given by Daniel.\u2021 Among the ruins are several neglected tanks swarming with alligators; and the dense damp jungles, overgrowing the more depressed parts, are infested with various kinds of snakes, amongst which the boa-constrictor has been killed above twenty feet in length. In the time of Abulfazl, in the latter part of the sixteenth century, there was here a great\u00a7 fort, to the east of which was a lake of considerable extent; and Tieffenthaler states\u2016 that it was surrounded by an earthen rampart twenty ells high, and so broad at top, that horses, elephants, and waggons, could move along it without difficulty. Gaur is probably a place\u2020 of great antiquity; the researches of Wilford,\u2021 \u2021 however, do not appear to establish it as of any great importance until A.D. 648, when its chief became independent, on the fall of the previously paramount sway of Magadha. The chiefs of Gaur from that time were powerful, until the reign of Lakshmana, from whom it probably received the name of Lucknouti, by which it is frequently mentioned in history. In 1202 the city was taken, and Lakshmana driven into flight, by Bakhtiar Khilji,\u00a7 a commander subordinate to Kutbuddin\n\n* Kimut Khest-Ghour, \"price of bricks of Gaur,\" \"a soubahdarry\" impost, established by Ali Verdi Cawn, to defray the expense of conveying away bricks from the ruins of the ancient city of Gaur.\"\n\n\u2020 Dow, as quoted by Rennell, states that it was the capital of Bengal 730 years before the birth of Christ; but his accuracy is to be little depended on.\n\n\u2021 See also Elliot, Supplement to Glossary, pp. 353, 354.\n\n\u00a7 Mem. of Map of Hindoostan, 55.\nGAUR.\n\nEibak, viceroy of Delhi, for Shahabuddin, monarch of Ghor, in Afghanistan. It in A.D. 1212 was made the capital of the kingdom of Bengal, by Ghiyasuddin, who built there a fine mosque, a college, a caravanserai, and made numerous embankments to protect the city against inundations. About a century and a half later, the seat of government was transferred to Pundua or Peruya, but restored to Gaur in 1409, by Jalaluddin Nasir Shah, in 1450, surrounded it with the vast rampart of which the extent may still be traced. In A.D. 1536, Shir Shah, the Patan rival of Humayun, having overrun Bengal, took Gaur, and drove its king, Mahmood, into flight, but was himself, the year after, dispossessed by Humayun, who resided for some months in the city, and changed its inauspicious name of Gaur to Jennetabad. He, however, found it necessary to retreat to the western part of his dominions, and his rival, Sher Shah, took possession of the city. After the death of Sher Shah, the governors of Bengal assumed the style of independent rulers of that country, until 1574, when Monaim Khan, in command of the troops of Akbar, subjugated it, and made it the seat of local government, but in a few months perished, with nearly all his troops, by the effects of the pestilential climate. From that period commenced the ruin of the city, and on the acquisition of the country by the British, soon after the middle of the eighteenth century, Maldah, and subsequently English Bazar, became the seats of government of the province. Gaur is distant from Burhampoor, N., 61 miles; from Calcutta, by Burhampoor, 179; Rajmahal, S.E., 25. Lat. 24\u00b0 55', long. 88\u00b0 8'.\n\n* The name of Gaur was no doubt Sanskrit; in which language it signifies \"sugar.\" In Persian, it signifies the grave, and was thence regarded inauspicious by those who used that language. Rennell is incorrect in stating that the change of name was made by Akbar, as Abulfazl, who could not have been mistaken, and who wrote in the time of Akbar, states, \"Jennutabad is a very ancient city, and was once the capital of Bengal. Formerly, it was called Lucknowty, and sometimes Gowr; the name it now bears was given by the late emperor (Humayun).\" Ferishta also states, \"Hoomayoon having occupied Goor, he caused that unprompted appellation to be changed for that of Junutabad.\" Tiefenthaler mentions, that the monarch gave the name ironically, in allusion to the pestilential atmosphere, deadly as well to the men as to the cattle of his army.\n\n---\n\n1 Ferishta, ii. 84.\n2 Mem. of Map of Hindoostan, 65.\n3 Ayeen Akbery, ii. 14.\n4 ii. 84.\n5 Beschreibung von Hindustan, i. 325.\nGAU\u2014GAY.\n\nGAURA.\u2014A town in the native state of Nepal, on the right bank of a branch of the San Coos river, and 55 miles E. from Khatmandoo.

It consists of two forts, one of which, fronting the north, where the rock is inaccessible, is defended by an outer fort, that entirely covers it to the north and west. All the walls are very strong, and rendered more formidable by bastions and towers. It is a post of considerable importance, as it commands a route much frequented across the mountains from south to north. Its strength is greatly increased by the extreme difficulty of transporting guns of sufficient calibre into commanding positions. Gawilgurh was taken by storm in 1803, by the British troops under Colonel Stevenson.

It consists of two parts, one the residence of the priests and of the population connected with them; the other, the quarters of the great bulk of the population. This last, the name of which was originally Elahabad, was much enlarged by Law,\u2020 and thence denominated Sahibgunj.\u2021 The streets in Sahibgunj are wide, straight, and have on each side a row of trees, between which is a road for carriages, with a footway on each side. The town is well laid out, but the houses are for the most part merely mud-built huts, though there are a few brick-built, having neat gardens. There is an hospital, principally for the relief of sick or wounded pilgrims. The old town of Gayah, which is inhabited by the priesthood and their retainers, \"is a strange-looking place,\" and its buildings are much better than those of Sahibgunj, the greater part of the houses being of brick and stone, and many of them having two or even three stories.\n\n* Gaya of Tassin; also of Wilson.\u2020 Sanscrit Dict. 283.\n\u2020 Law commanded the French force in this part of India from 1757 to 1761.\n\u2021 Sahibgunj; from Sahib, \"gentleman,\" and Ganj, \"market.\"\nGAZ\u2014GEE.\n\nThe architecture is very singular, with corners, turrets, and galleries projecting with every possible irregularity.\" From this style of building, and the elevated site, the appearance of this portion of the town from a distance is picturesque, but on entering it, the streets are found crooked, narrow, and uneven, and withal so filthy, as to be with difficulty passable. The town and its vicinity abound in shrines and places of pilgrimage, the visits of votaries to which are attended with heavy charges, some persons of high rank having been known to expend 4,000l. or 5,000l. each. The torrent Phalgu is considered a holy stream, and ghats, or flights of stone stairs, give access to the water, for the purpose of ritual ablution. The best-built and most-revered structure is the Vishnupod,* a building in an elaborate style of architecture, eighty-two feet in length, and surmounted by an octagonal pyramid about 100 feet high. It was built at a cost of 30,000l. by Ahalya Bai, a superstitious Mahratta princess of Indore. The number of pilgrims annually has been estimated at 100,000, though in some years there have been double that number. Between the two towns, on an area once called the Ramna or Game Preserve, is the British civil establishment, consisting of the ordinary European and native functionaries. Buchanan estimated the number of houses at the time of his visit, early in the present century, at 6,400; which, according to the usually admitted ratio of inmates, would give the amount of population at about 32,000 persons. A considerable enlargement of the town, and a proportional increase of its inhabitants, appears to have subsequently taken place, a late return giving the number of houses at 9,165, and the population at 43,451.5 Gayah is distant 55 miles S. of Patna, 265 N.W. of Calcutta.

The defile is not more than ten or twelve feet wide, and is bounded on each side by rather high and rugged hills. Though much frequented, it does not appear to be regarded as important in a military point of view, probably from the facility with which it can be turned. It is five miles N.W. of Attock.

His officers now advised unconditional surrender, but Thomas determined, if possible, to effect a retreat to Hansi. Quitting his camp accordingly, at the head of a small body of cavalry, he fell in with a party of the enemy, who attacked him with vigour, and his men, dispirited by constant defeat, giving way on all sides, he made his escape with difficulty to Hansi, the scene of his final discomfiture.

It extends in a direction nearly from south-east to north-west, between lat. 29\u00b0 14'\u201429\u00b0 80', long. 79\u00b0 10'\u201479\u00b0 40'; is about thirty-five miles in length, with an average breadth probably of ten or twelve. Though the most southern range of the great Himalayan system, and the most remote from the line of greatest elevation, it exceeds in height some which intervene. This circumstance has been pointed out by Herbert.\u00b2 \"On each side of this line [that of greatest elevation], to the north as well as to the south, the peaks diminish in elevation, yet not equally. To the southward the decrease is more rapid, and is accompanied by an anomaly which is sufficiently striking. The diminution of elevation, which is pretty regular till near the boundary of the plains and mountain-land, is there suddenly interrupted. The peaks shoot up considerably above the mean elevation of those immediately north of them, and as suddenly sink into the plains; so that if we divide the country south of the line of greatest elevation into five parallel zones, the fifth will be as high as the third, while the fourth will be found con-\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C.

The mouth of the Ghara creek is in lat. 24\u00b0 45', long. 67\u00b0 12'. As the country on each side of Ghara is low, both westward, to the mouth of this creek, and also eastward, and the stream communicates with the Indus, it seems probable that a ship-canal might be formed to connect Kurrachee with the deep and wide part of the Indus, near Tatta. The country between the Ghara river and the port of Kurrachee, it is to be observed, is also low and suitable for the purpose.\nGHARA.\u2014The name by which the united streams of the Beas and Sutluj are known, from their confluence at Endreesa to the confluence with the Chenaub, in lat. 29\u00b0 18', long. 71\u00b0 6'. The length of course between these points is about 300 miles. After the confluence last mentioned, the united streams are called the Punjnad. At the ferry of Hurekee, a short distance below the confluence of the Beas and Sutluj, Burns found \"the Ghara a beautiful stream, never fordable,\" 275 yards wide at the lowest season, and twelve feet deep, running at the rate of two miles and a quarter an hour. In the same locality Vigne found it 200 yards wide. It is remarkably direct in its general course, which is south-west, but tortuous at short intervals. In the lower part of its course, where it forms the boundary, it is a slow muddy stream, with low banks of soft alluvial earth, overflowed to the extent of several miles on occasion of the slightest swell. The confluence with the Chenaub takes place without any turbulence, in a low marshy tract, in which the channels of the rivers are continually changing. Each river is about 500 yards wide, and the united stream about 800 yards. The water of the Chenaub is reddish, that of the Ghara pale; and for several miles downwards, the difference of hue may be observed, the right side of the stream being of a red, and the left of a pale hue.\n\nGHATAMPOOR, in the district of Bainswara, territory of Oude, a town three miles from the left bank of the Ganges, 45 miles S. of Lucknow, 22 S.E. of Cawnpore.

Lat. 26\u00b0 9', long. 80\u00b0 13'.\nGHAUTS (WESTERN).\u2014An extensive range of mountains of Southern India. Their northern limit is the valley of the Taptee, of which a branch from the Syadree Mountains (as the upper part of the Western Ghats is called by the natives) forms the southern inclosing range about lat. $21^\\circ - 21^\\circ 15'$, long. $73^\\circ 45' - 74^\\circ 40'$, and is connected with groups which diminish in height towards the east until they sink into the table-land of Berar. The northern side of the valley of the Taptee is inclosed by the Satpura range, having an elevation of about 2,000 feet above the sea. The Syadree range in this part consists of trappean formations, which extend to the seacoast, forming the rocks of Bombay and Salsette, and others in that vicinity. In lat. $21^\\circ 10'$, long. $74^\\circ$, this great range (the Western Ghauts) turns south nearly at right angles to that which forms the south inclosing range of the valley of the Taptee. Its elevation increases as it proceeds southwards, and at Mahabulishwar, in lat. $18^\\circ$, long. $73^\\circ 40'$, is 4,700 feet above the sea. In this part, as elsewhere, the western declivity is abrupt, and its base depressed nearly to the level of the sea: on the eastern side, though generally undulating, or even rugged, it slopes gradually eastward towards the plains of Hyderabad. In respect to geological structure, it may be observed generally, that the great core of the Western Ghauts is of primary formation, inclosed by alternating strata of more recent origin. These strata, however, have been broken up by prodigious outbursts of volcanic rocks, and from Mahabulishwar to their northern limit, the overlying rock of the Western Ghauts is stated to be exclusively of the trap formation. The face towards the Concan is not uniformly precipitous, but consists of vast terraces with abrupt fronts, such a conformation being characteristic of this kind of rock. The scenery is delightful and grand, \u201cdisplaying stupendous scarps, fearful chasms, numerous waterfalls, dense forests, and perennial verdure.\u201d \u201cThe Western Ghauts,\u201d says Elphinstone, \u201cpresent the charms of mountain scenery on a smaller scale\u201d than the Himalayas; \u201cbut it is no exaggeration of their merits to say, that they strongly resemble the valleys of the Neda and\n\n* A contributor to the Asiatic Researches says, \u201cThe elevation of this part of the range seldom exceeds 8,000 feet.\u201d\u2014Calder, General Observations on the Geology of India, vol. xviii. p. 4.\nthe Ladon, which have long been the boast of Arcadia and of Europe.\" Chasms and breaks in the brows or the culminating ridges of the range, give access to the highlands, and are denominated ghauts or passes, a name which has become generally applied to the range itself. The principal elevations between the eighteenth and nineteenth degrees of latitude, are Poorundhur,\\(^2\\) 4,472 feet; Singhur, 4,162; Hurreechundurghur, 3,894. In consequence of the boldness of the declivities and the precipitous character of the faces of the trap rocks, the summits in many parts of the range are nearly inaccessible. The natural strength of these portions has in many instances been increased by art, and the hill forts in all ages of Indian history have been regarded as the bulwarks of the Deccan. The trap formation terminates southward on the seacoast, in about lat. \\(18^\\circ\\), and is succeeded by laterite, a ferruginous clay, easily cut when first raised, but by continued exposure to the atmosphere becoming hard as brick. This last-mentioned formation extends southwards as the overlying rock, almost without interruption, to Cape Comorin, covering the base of the mountains and the narrow slip of land that separates them from the sea. South of Mahabuleshwar, and in latitude about \\(15^\\circ\\), the elevation\\(^3\\) diminishes, so as not to be more than 1,000 feet above the sea; the slopes are gradual, and the outlines rounded. Still farther to the south, however, the elevation increases, and attains its maximum towards Coorg, where Bonasson Hill\\(^4\\) is said to be 7,000 feet above the sea;\\(^5\\) Tandianmole, 5,781; Pupagiri, 5,682. South of those elevations, the Ghauts join the Neilgherry\\(^6\\) group by means of the Nedimula range, which forms the western buttress of the Neilgherry table-land to lat. \\(11^\\circ 15'\\), long. \\(76^\\circ 25'\\), where it rises into the lofty Kunda Mountains, and about twenty-five miles farther south\\(^7\\) terminates abruptly in high and nearly perpendicular precipices, forming the northern side of that great valley or depression, which, affording an uninterrupted communication in this latitude between the eastern and western sides of the peninsula, is bounded on the south by the extensive range of mountains of which Cape Comorin is the extremity. South of this valley, the mountains are described as lofty, and pouring down cascades of prodigious height.\\(^8\\) The width of this extensive gap, called the\n\n---\n\n\\(^2\\) Sykes, ut supra, 412.\n\n\\(^3\\) Buchanan, Narr. of Journey from Madras, through Mysore, Canara, and Malabar, iii. 206.\n\n\\(^4\\) Madras Journ. of Lit. and Sci.

The mountains rising on the south side of Palghat Valley, and which may, with some latitude of expression, be called a continuation of the Western Ghauts, have considerable elevation, a spacious table-land, being 4,740 feet above the sea, a peaked summit 6,000, another 7,000; and there are several peaks not measured, but judged by sight to have elevations not inferior. The length of the chain of mountains extending from Cape Comorin to the valley of Palghat is 200 miles. The western brow of the range is, with little exception, abrupt; on the eastern side of the culminating range, the declivity is in general gradual, the surface in many places being extensive table-land, sloping gently, and nearly imperceptibly, eastward. Such a conformation would seem to indicate a volcanic disturbance of the surface, the disruption taking place along the western precipitous face.*\n\nIt has been supposed that the steep declivity of the Western Ghauts on the seaward side, by presenting a vast front to the violence of the south-west monsoon, is instrumental in arresting and condensing the abundant moisture borne along by that formidable aerial current from the Indian Ocean, and that the excessive rains which fall in the Concan and in Malabar result from this cause. Such a conclusion, however, is at variance with the fact that Chili and Peru, similarly circumstanced with respect to the Pacific Ocean and the Cordilleras, are amongst the driest countries in the world,\u2014a discrepancy the cause of which does not appear to have been explained. But it is not only the countries intervening between the mountains and the sea that are visited with so great a superabundance of rain: the fall on the west brow of the Western Ghauts is enormous, and perhaps unparalleled. At Mahabulishwar, in lat. 18\u00b0, long. 73\u00b0 40', the mean annual fall of rain is 239\n\n* A similar instance, on a scale of less magnitude, occurred in the convulsion which, a few years ago, upheaved the west coast of Chili to a considerable extent.\nGHAUTS.\n\ninches. There, however, during a considerable portion of the year, the weather is dry. Not so at Bednore, in lat. 13\u00b0 49', long. 75\u00b0 6', situate on the western verge of the table-land of Mysore, and near the western brow of the verge. There \"nine rainy months\" in the year are usually calculated on, and for six of that number it is the practice in most families to make the same preparatory arrangements for provision (water only excepted) as are adopted for a ship proceeding on a six months' voyage.\" In consequence of this excessive moisture, the low tract between the Ghauts and the sea is traversed by innumerable torrents, which, stagnating as they approach the coast, overspread the depressed levels, and form that extraordinary series of shallow lakes called by the British Backwaters.\n\nThe word Ghauts, as already mentioned, is an appellation given by the British to the range which in its northern part is by the natives called Syadree, in its southern Sukhien.\n\nGHAUTS (EASTERN).\u2014A chain of mountains of Southern India, rising in the vicinity of Balasore, in about the same latitude as the Western Ghauts on the opposite side of the peninsula. This chain may be traced in a south-westerly direction, a little to the west of Ganjam, and thence to Naggery Nose, about 56 miles N.W. of Madras, where it forms a junction with the range, \"which sweeping irregularly inland, crosses the peninsula in a south-west direction by Chittore, Sautghur, and Salem, and joins the Western Ghauts north of the Gap of Paulghautcherry.\" The direction of the Eastern Ghauts, south of the point of junction with the transverse range, is marked at intervals along the coast of Coromandel, by outliers and detached hills to a point within about twenty miles of Cape Comorin, where the Eastern and Western Ghauts appear united. It is to be observed, however, that the point of junction between the two great ranges of Malabar and Coromandel is not unusually regarded as taking place at the Neilgherries, \"which, rising into the loftiest summits of the peninsula, form the southern boundary of the great table-land\" of the Deccan. The average elevation of the Eastern Ghauts is stated to be about 1,500 feet. With regard to geological structure, granite is said to constitute the basis of the whole range, and overlying the granite, gneiss and mica-slate that form the sides of the mountains, are occasionally found\n\n---\n\n1 Journ.

It is bounded on the north-west and north by the British district Azimgurh; on the north-east by the great river Ghagra, separating it from the British district Sarun; on the south-east by the British district Shahabad; on the south partly by the British district Shahabad, partly by the British district Benares; and on the west by the British districts Benares and Jaunpore. It lies between lat. 25\u00b0 17'\u201426\u00b0, long. 83\u00b0 8'\u201484\u00b0 40'; is ninety-six miles in length from east to west, and forty in breadth. It embraces an area of 2,187 square miles. The Ganges traverses it with a sinuous course, but generally in a direction from west to east, for about fifty-six miles, first entering the district in lat. 25\u00b0 30', long. 83\u00b0 22', having previously formed its south-western boundary towards Benares for about ten miles. Its course within the district is terminated by its reaching the south-eastern frontier in lat. 25\u00b0 30', long. 83\u00b0 58'; but it continues to form the\n\n* \"Town of Ghaziddin,\" or \"Town of the Champion of the Faith.\"\nGHAZEPORE.\n\nsouthern boundary towards Shahabad for seventy miles more, to the point where it receives the Ghagra. The course of the Ghagra along the north-eastern frontier is thirty-six miles, first touching on the district in lat. 26\u00b0, long. 84\u00b0 12', and leaving it in lat. 25\u00b0 48', long. 84\u00b0 46'. The Karamnasa forms the south-eastern boundary for about forty-five miles; the Tons, called in some places the Sarju, flows for about fifty miles between the Ghagra and the Ganges, falling into the latter. The Bisu, the Manghi, and the Gangi, flow in some measure parallel to the Tons, and like it, fall into the Ganges. There are, besides, numerous smaller streams, most of which become dry in the hot season. The country on both sides of the Ganges slopes gently, probably in the degree of seven or eight inches in a mile, from north-west to south-east. In the eastern part of the district is one large piece of water, called Surhah Talao; and many jhils or shallow lakes are dispersed over the country. The elevation of the waterway of the Ganges where it is greatest, that is, at the western extremity of the district, is about* 260 feet; and as there are no eminences of any importance, probably no point in the district is much more than 350 feet above the sea. Water in some places is to be had by digging to the depth of ten or twelve feet, in others it is not to be obtained at less depth than fifty or sixty feet. From the resources afforded by wells, tanks, jhils, and rivers, the means of irrigation are derived; and the practice is universally pursued, it being indispensable for the success of the rubbee or crop grown in the cool or dry season, commencing in October and ending in the following March. The climate is in general healthy, except at the close of autumn, when fevers are common, but not remarkably malignant in character. The thermometer\u00b2 ranges in the coldest months from 58\u00b0 to 71\u00b0; in April, 86\u00b0 to 96\u00b0; May, 86\u00b0 to 98\u00b0; June, 85\u00b0 to 98\u00b0; July, 86\u00b0 to 96\u00b0.\n\nThere are two regular crops off the soil every year: the kurreef, sown at the end of June, being the period when the\n\n* According to Prinsep (James), the elevation\u00b9 of Benares above the sea is 270 feet; the fall of the waterway of the Ganges in this part of its course is estimated\u00b2 at five inches per mile, and as the place where the river first touches on the district is twenty miles lower down the stream than Benares, its elevation may be taken at 260 feet.\n\n\u00b9 As.

The rubbee, or crop sown in the cool season and gathered in summer, consists of wheat, barley, oats, gram, oil-seeds, safflower, opium, cotton, tobacco, and sugar. The sugarcane of this district is greatly esteemed, and fetches a high price. According to a statement published in the year 1841, the export of sugar in one year amounted to 3,639,528 rupees in value. The other principal exports in the same year were cotton, 1,829,522 rupees; opium, 1,463,692 rupees; indigo, 577,660 rupees; nitre, 245,954 rupees; molasses, 218,081 rupees; timber, 19,577 rupees. The imports are comparatively scanty and unimportant; the principal being piece-goods, 36,610 rupees; timber, 12,741 rupees; tobacco, 3,285 rupees.\n\nThe number of the entire population is returned at 1,059,287; and thus subdivided:\u2014Hindoos, agricultural, 673,743; non-agricultural, 271,676; Mahomedans, and others not Hindoo, agricultural, 31,548; non-agricultural, 82,320. It thus appears that the numbers of the agricultural classes nearly double those of the non-agricultural, and that the Hindoos are more than seven times as many as the followers of all other systems. The number of inhabitants to the square mile is about 484. The chief places stand in the following order as to population:\n\n| Number containing less than 1,000 inhabitants | 1,888 |\n|---------------------------------------------|------|\n| Ditto more than 1,000 and less than 5,000 ditto | 209 |\n| Ditto 5,000 \" 10,000 \" | 23* |\n| Ditto 10,000 \" 50,000 \" | 5 |\n\nTotal inhabited ........................................... 2,070\n\nInhabitants:\n- Chaonee Ghazeepore in Pergunnah Ghazeepore, ........ 5,075\n- Ghazeepore, ditto .................. 7,022\n- Dhanaspore, Mubaitch ............. 5,712\n- Guhmur, Zumania ................. 7,421\n- Mudden Benarus, ditto ............ 5,126\n- Mohomedpore, ditto ............... 5,598\n- Bareh, ditto ...................... 7,042\n- Rujyeepore, Mahomedabad ......... 7,366\n- Nurhee, Gurha .................... 5,894\nGHAZEEPORE.\n\nThe language spoken by the common people, is Hindee of a very corrupt kind.\n\nThe principal routes are,\u20141. From Benares through Ghazeepore to Buxar, crossing this district from west to east; 2. from the cantonment of Goruckpore to that of Ghazeepore, north to south; 3. from Azimgurh to Ghazeepore, north-west to southeast; 4. from Chupra through Ghazeepore town to Jaunpore, east to west; 5. from Ghazeepore, crossing the Ganges at the eastern extremity of the town, pursuing a direction north to south, and joining at Sawunt the great route from Calcutta to Benares.\n\nThe tract comprised within this district probably formed in remote antiquity part of the \"territory which in ancient legend is called Maha Kosala,\" first subject to the sovereigns of Ayodhya, subsequently to those of Kanouj. On the overthrow of the Kanouj dynasty, by the victory gained in 1194, over Jaya Chandra, by Mohammad of Ghor, this tract fell under Patan sway, from which it was wrested by the conquering Baber. On the dissolution of the empire of Delhi, consequent on the invasion of Ahmed Shah Durani in 1761, it formed part of the portion seized by Shujah-ood-dowlah, nawaub-vizier of Oude. In 1764, the emperor of Delhi, Shah Allum, granted the territory of Ghazeepore to the East-India Company.\n\n| Syudpore | in Pergunnah Syudpore | 8,200 |\n|----------|----------------------|-------|\n| Omapore  | Khurreed             | 5,820 |\n| Utter Dundee | ditto            | 8,212 |\n| Oundee   | ditto                | 9,037 |\n| Usegah   | ditto                | 7,807 |\n| Upail    | ditto                | 5,946 |\n| Ikouna   | Bullia               | 7,005 |\n| Ulumchuck | ditto              | 5,878 |\n| Sheoporedeer | ditto          | 6,382 |\n| Oodyseepore | ditto           | 5,865 |\n| Bunkutta | ditto                | 5,026 |\n| Ikulwar  | Kopacheet            | 9,814 |\n| Areepore | ditto                | 6,382 |\n| Ubdoopore | Zuhoorabad         | 6,684 |\n| Reotepore | Zumania             | 17,355 |\n| Ukberpore | Khurreed            | 13,918 |\n| Ujnera   | ditto                | 10,558 |\n| Rusa     | Lukhneur             | 10,683 |\n| Ibraheempore | Doaba          | 26,582 |\n\nInhabitants.\nCompany, by whom, in the subsequent year, it was relinquished to the nawaub-vizier of Oude. Finally, in 1775, the nawaub-vizier by treaty ceded it, with other districts, to the East-India Company. In the Ayeen Akbery it is styled Sirar Ghazipoor, in soobah of Allahabad. Its military contingent is there stated at 310 cavalry, 16,650 infantry; and its revenue at 335,782 rupees.\n\nGHAZEEPORE, the principal place of the district of the same name, is situate on the left bank of the Ganges, which is crossed by ferry at the north-eastern extremity of the town. Bishop Heber states the river to be here as wide as the Hooghly at Cosipore. Ghazeepore is surrounded by luxuriant groves of the banyan (Ficus indica) and pipal (Ficus religiosa), enlivened by flocks of nightingales, jays, crested sparrows, and many other birds; and by crowds of monkeys, unmolested, and familiar as domestic animals. Ghazeepore contains a population of 7,022 persons. Viewed from the river, its appearance is very striking; but, on closer inspection, the buildings are found to be mostly in ruins. At the eastern extremity of the town is a palace, which, though somewhat disfigured by time and neglect, still retains abundant marks of former beauty. It is said to have been built by Meer Cossim Ali, the nawaub of Bengal, infamous for the massacre in cold blood of his British prisoners. \"It is raised on a high bank,\" and on a point commanding two great reaches of the river, up and down. From the bank, which is full thirty feet from the water, is raised another basement of brick and masonry, fifteen feet high, in which are some apartments; on this is the building, which is an oblong square (rectangle), with great pavilions at the angles, and in the centre of each side; the whole is an open space, supported by colonnades surrounding it. Within, on the floor of the building, is a channel for water, about four feet wide, which encircles the floor; and at equal spaces there were formerly fountains. In the centre of the building is a space sufficient to contain twenty people. Nearly adjoining to this palace is a building for the purpose of raising water for the fountains, and supplying them by means of pipes, which com-\n\n* Champion's Town; from Ghazi, \"a champion or hero, distinguished in war against infidels,\" and Pur, \"town.\"\n\n\u2020 A view of it is given in Hodges' Select Views in India, vol. i. view 7.\nGHAZEEPORE.\n\nmunicate with each other.\" Heber characterizes\u2078 the palace as the best and most airy of any eastern building which he had seen, with magnificent verandas, and capable of being made, at no great expense, one of the handsomest and best-situated houses in India. It is at present a custom-house,\u2079 the numerous apartments being converted into store-rooms and habitations for the guards and officials. There is a jail\u2079 here, reported to be large, strong, and airy. The bazars are well constructed, and well supplied, the skill of the tailors especially being noted. A few Europeans keep shops, duly furnished with wares in demand with the population from home.\u00b9 Ghazeepore is celebrated for its rose-water, and the rose-fields\u00b2 in the vicinity of the town occupy several hundred acres. Some attar, or essential oil, is also made, and is sold, even after some adulteration as is believed, at the rate of 10l. for one rupee-weight. There is a church,\u00b3 represented as a very attractive object, and an hospital.\u2074 At the south-west end of the town, and separated from it by gardens and scattered cottages, are the bungalows or lodges of the servants of the Company, here employed on civil duties. These consist generally of spacious\u2075 and handsome apartments, mostly on ground-floors. Beyond these are the military cantonments, the buildings in which are low and unsightly, with sloping roofs of red tiles. Contiguous is a cenotaph monument to Lord Cornwallis, who died here in 1805, while in progress up the country. It is constructed of excellent stone, but, according to Heber,\u2076 the style and execution are utterly at variance with good taste. It has been suggested, however, that it might be turned to account by being converted into a belfry, in the event of a church being built in contiguity to it. Two miles inland from the river are the remains\u2077 of a serai, or lodge for travellers, and nearly adjoining, several tombs, in a handsome style of architecture, and good preservation. Races, held close to the town, are some of the best and most frequented in India. A stud,\u2078 which government maintains in the vicinity, supplies the cavalry and horse artillery with many good horses.\n\nFrom observations\u2079 on the thermometer, made in the town of Ghazeepore, in the years 1831 and 1832, May appears to have been the hottest month (mean temperature 97\u00b0), and January the coldest (mean temperature 56\u00b0).

There is no bar at the entrance, the depths being from five to seven fathoms, and from three to four fathoms inside at low water. The rise of the tide is about six or seven feet.\" Gheriah was fortified,\\(^3\\) in 1662, by Sevajee, the Mahratta chief. It subsequently passed into the possession of the Angria branch of the Bosla family, from whom the Portuguese and English in 1722, and the Dutch two years later, in vain attempted to wrest\\(^4\\) it. In 1755, it was attacked by a British\\(^5\\) force, consisting of three ships of the line, one ship of fifty guns, and one of forty-four, with some armed vessels belonging to the Bombay marine, amounting altogether to fourteen sail, commanded by Admiral Watson, and having on board 800\nEuropeans and 1,000 native soldiers, under Colonel Clive. A bombardment was immediately commenced; Angria's fleet was totally destroyed, and, in the course of a few hours, the place surrendered. It was a few months afterwards given up to the Peishwa, under the treaty concluded with the Mahrattas in 1756, and finally acquired by the British government on the overthrow of that potentate in 1818.\n\nThe name Gheriah is that by which the fort was denominated by the Mussulmans, Viziadroog being the name more familiar to the Mahrattas.

Its remotest head-water, as far as has been hitherto ascertained, is the source of the Kalee (Eastern), on the south-western declivity of the range forming the northern boundary of the British district of Kumaon, towards South-western Tibet. This spot, situate in lat. $30^\\circ 28'$, long. $80^\\circ 40'$, was visited by Webb, and is thus described by him: \"The Kalee river, two furlongs distant, its breadth reduced to four or five yards. At two and a quarter miles, in a north-west direction, it is covered with snow, and no longer to be traced; neither is the road passable beyond this point at the present season. After the middle of July, when the thaw is perfected, it may be traced as a small stream for about four miles more, in the direction last mentioned, and from thence to its head in the snow, north-west two miles farther. The stream scarcely flows in winter, being derived almost exclusively from the thawing snow.\" The elevation above the sea of the source is probably between 17,000 and 18,000 feet. The river takes a south-easterly direction down the valley of Beeans, receiving numerous snow-fed torrents right and left; and at thirty miles from its source, the Kalipani, a considerable stream, flows into it on the left side. Two or three miles below that point, the river turns to the south-west, in which direction it continues to flow twenty-three miles farther, to the confluence of the Dhouli, a large river, which falls into it on the right side, in lat. $29^\\circ 57'$, long. $80^\\circ 38'$. The Kalee, which at the confluence appears to be twice the size of the Dhouli, is previously a vast torrent, and in many places a huge cataract tumbling over vast rocks, which in some spots form natural bridges, being wedged together by their pressure against each other, and against the sides of the precipices inclosing the deep gorges down which the stream rushes. In many places the stream for considerable distances is totally hidden under glaciers. Below the confluence the stream is thirty yards wide; but, swelled by numerous mountain-streams received right and left, it soon attains a width of eighty yards. It continues to flow in a\n\n* Ghaghra of Shakespear;\u00b9 Gogra or Ghogra of Wilson;\u00b2 Gharghara and Ghaghra of Wilford;\u00b3 Ghaghra of Buchanan;\u2074 Gogra of Rennell;\u2075 Gogar or Goger of the translators of Baber.\u2076\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C.

This confluence is in lat. $29^\\circ 45'$, long. $80^\\circ 25'$, and is 1,972 feet above the sea; so that the river has a descent, so far, of about 15,500 feet in seventy-five miles, or 207 feet per mile. Below this place twelve miles, and eighty-seven from its source, the river is represented in the surveyor-general's map as receiving on the left side, from Nepaul, the Chumulea; and three miles lower down, at the Jhula ghat, a ferry from Kumaon to Nepaul, the elevation of the water's edge is 1,789 feet; so that the declivity of the waterway now diminishes to twelve feet per mile. Sixteen miles below this, at Puchesur, lat. $29^\\circ 27'$, long. $80^\\circ 18'$, it on the right side receives the Surjoo (Western), the greatest of its feeders. Thenceforward the united stream is no longer called the Kalee, but, variously, the Sarda, the Surjoo, and the Ghogra. At Puchesur it turns a little to the south-east, and ten miles lower down, on the right, receives the Lohoghat river, two miles below the confluence of which a large tributary from Nepaul flows in on the left. Turning southwards at that point, it, at a distance of eighteen miles beyond, receives on the right the Ludheca, a considerable stream. By all these accessions it becomes a great river, and at Birimdeo, twelve miles lower down, in lat. $29^\\circ 6'$, long. $80^\\circ 13'$, and 148 miles* from its source, it enters the plain of Hindoostan, 798 feet above the sea. Webb found it \"about 150 yards broad on an average, bed stony, very deep, and moderately rapid.\" Herbert estimates the discharge of water here during the dry season at 4,800 cubic feet per second; that of the Ganges at 7,000, at Hurdwar. From within a few miles of its source to this place, according to Art. V. of the treaty of Seegowlee, it forms the boundary between the British district of Kumaon and Nepaul, holding generally in this part of its course a direction nearly from north-east to south-west. From Birimdeo guardhouse, the river, sweeping first for about twenty-three miles in a southerly direction, forms for that distance the boundary between the British district of Pillebheet and the territory of Oude, and subsequently, flowing south-east for forty-five more, forms the boundary between the British\n\n* Herbert, however, makes its length of course 180 miles.\n\n\u2020 Ut supra, p. xxii.\nGHOGRA.\n\ndistrict of Shahjehanpore and the territory of Oude. In that interval, according to Buchanan, it becomes navigable for craft of considerable burthen from Mundeya, in lat. 28\u00b0 40', long. 80\u00b0 18', but probably those of lighter description can be brought up as far as the vicinity of the egress from the mountains, or about forty miles higher. One hundred and ten miles below Birimdeo, it on the left side receives the Kurnalli, flowing from the mountains of Nepaul, whence much timber is sent by the stream. Buchanan regards this river merely as a different channel by which the great river Setiganga, descending from the Himalayas of Nepaul, discharges itself. Wilford considers the Setiganga or Swetanga as identical with the Gunduck.* According to the surveyor-general's map, at ninety-four miles below the last-mentioned confluence, and in lat. 27\u00b0 10', long. 81\u00b0 25', the Ghogra receives on the right side a considerable tributary in the united streams of the Chouka and Woel; twenty-two miles farther down, it on the left side receives the Eastern Surjoo, and thenceforward is known in Oude by the names Deoha, Surjoo, or Sarayu, as well as Ghogra. Butter describes it as navigable for the largest class of boats in all seasons, and as having an annual rise and fall of thirty feet. Forty-two miles below the confluence of the Surjoo (Eastern), it touches on the British district of Goruckpore, having passed in its course the city of Oude. Thence pursuing a south-easterly direction, it forms for seventy-five miles the boundary between the British district and the territory of Oude. In this part of its course it is considered by Buchanan larger than the Ganges at Chunar, and is from one to three miles in breadth. Like other great rivers traversing low alluvial tracts, it sends off lateral watercourses, communicating in the rainy season by numerous offsets with the parent flood, and with each other. Of these the principal, called the Tons (North-eastern), leaves the Ghogra on the right side, ten miles above the city of Oude, and, taking a south-easterly course, falls into the Ganges near Bhullea. The Ghogra enters the British territory in lat. 26\u00b0 15', long. 83\u00b0 11', and, still pursuing a south-easterly direction for sixty-five miles, forms the boundary between the British districts of Goruckpore.\n\n* This evidently is erroneous. In Walker's new map of India the Kurnalli river is represented as forming a junction with the Ghogra in the locality assigned by Buchanan as that of the mouths of the Setiganga.\nGHO.\n\nand Azimgurh. In this part of its course, it on the left side, and in lat. 26\u00b0 12', long. 83\u00b0 46', receives the large river Raptee, and at other points a few streams of less importance. Flowing still south-east, it for eight miles forms the boundary between the districts of Azimgurh and Sarun, and for thirty-six miles the boundary between the districts Ghazeepore and Sarun, joining the Ganges, on the left side of the latter river, in lat. 25\u00b0 46', long. 84\u00b0 40'. The total length of course of the Ghogra may be estimated at 606 miles. According to Buchanan, an eye-witness of the confluence, the Ghogra certainly exceeds the Ganges in breadth and rapidity, and equally in depth. Though throughout the year navigable nearly to the mountains, the Ghogra is turned to little account in this respect. The navigation is indeed in some places rendered hazardous and intricate by the occurrence of shoals of kunkur or calcareous conglomerate; but engineering skill, with adequate means, could easily remove such obstructions, and render free the navigation of the Ghogra, as well as throw open that of its tributaries the Raptee and the Chouka.\n\nGHOLAB SINGH'S DOMINIONS.\u2014See CASHMERE.\n\nGHOONGEE.\u00b9\u2014A river which has its source beyond the northern frontier of British India, in the Nepaul territory, and in about lat. 27\u00b0 50', long. 83\u00b0 20'. It holds a course generally southerly, and at Lotan, about seventy miles from its source, and in lat. 27\u00b0 15', long. 83\u00b0 19', Buchanan found it in January to have a deep channel, along which rolled a wide, rapid, fordable stream. It receives many streams right and left, and by lateral channels communicates with numerous pieces of water, stagnant or running; drains or fertilizes, by means of its many branches, a great extent of country, and, running still in a direction generally south-easterly, joins the Dhumela in lat. 27\u00b0 5', long. 83\u00b0 12', and ultimately falls into the Raptee on the left side, in lat. 27\u00b0 3', long. 83\u00b0 12', having altogether flowed about 100 miles.\n\n* According to Buchanan, it is in the upper part of its course called the Ghaghar, and after running southwards about seventeen miles, joins a branch of the river called the Tinay; whenceforward the united volume of water is called the Ghoongee. But from a map on a very large scale, recently constructed under government authority, there does not appear to be any connection between the Ghoongee and the Tinay.\nGHOOROUTUH, or GAROTAH, in the British district of Goorgaon, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a village on the route from Muttra to Delhi, by the right bank of the Jumna, and 55 miles S.E. of the latter city.

The river here has a very dangerous rapid, with a sudden fall of a foot and a half, resulting from the lateral contraction of the high and rocky banks inclosing it, as the depth is no less than 186 feet. Wood\u00b2 describes the passage as very dangerous. \"Though the fall was shot with startling rapidity, the boat, when over, seemed spell-bound to the spot, and hung for some time under the watery wall in spite of the most strenuous efforts of her crew. At last she moved, the men cheered, and out she darted into the fair channel.\" The breadth of the Indus here is only 250 feet, and through this narrow gut the whole of its immense volume of water rushes at the rate of from nine to ten miles an hour, and with the noise of thunder. Ghora Trup is about six miles below Nilab, and for the whole of this distance the river may be described as one immense and irresistible rapid.

The inhabitants of this country appear to be Mahometans of the Shia persuasion, recently converted from idolatry of the same kind as that followed by their neighbours of Kafiristan, whom they still resemble in their social habits, and more especially in their great fondness for potent home-made wine. Their country is very rugged: the mountainous parts are barren; the lower, though sandy, are rendered productive by irrigation and industrious culture.

Around its base is a maze of gorges, valleys, and hills of moderate height, richly clothed with a luxuriant and dense jungle, diversified only with black rocks, which occasionally appear through the trees and vegetation. After this belt of vegetation terminates, the sacred mount for the\u00b3 rest of the ascent rises as an immense bare and isolated granite rock, presenting all the gigantic masses peculiar to that formation. The whole face of the rock is quite black, with occasional white streaks, probably of felspar. The sides to the north and south are nearly perpendicular scarps; on the extreme point of the northern side is an immense pillar or boulder, which seems as it were poised on its pinnacle, requiring only a slight force to dislodge it. This pillar is sometimes the scene of self-destruction, and is hence called the Beiru Jhap, or leap of death. The number of peaks which crown this mountain is variously stated. According to Tod,\u2074 there are six, the most elevated of which is that of Goruknath, having on its summit an area of only ten feet in diameter, surmounted by a small shrine, cut out of a single stone, and dedicated to Goruknath; each of the other peaks has its shrine, dedicated to some imaginary sacred personage. On a small table-land or platform on the side of the mountain, and about six hundred feet below the summit, is the ancient palace of Khengar, and contiguous to it numerous Jain temples, reached by a pathway generally about five feet wide, with steps of masonry. They are situate within an inclosure, which comprises eight temples, a dharamsala or eleemosynary establishment, and two tanks. The original material of those buildings was granite, but the numerous repairs of the injuries caused by time, or the devastating zeal of the Mussulmans, have been\nGIRNAR.\n\nmade in a softer stone, brought from the base of the mountain. The temples are dedicated each respectively to some deceased leader, or spiritual pastor of the Jains, considered to have been deified. The largest and most gorgeous, though by no means the most ancient, is dedicated to Nimnath; another is dedicated to the favourite object of reverence, Parisnath. There are many images of those personages, generally of small size; but that of Bikhaddeo is a colossal figure of granite, in a sitting posture, thirteen feet in height from the top of the head to the seat. Besides these, there are three antique temples, apparently of Buddhist origin. The southern end of the enclosure, containing those temples, is flanked by the palace of Khengar, an ancient monarch of Saurashtra, the present Guzerat. This memorial of ancient greatness has battlemented walls, defended by massive square towers, built of blocks of granite, and commands the sole entrance to the sacred precincts. \"The whole of this extraordinary mount,\" says a recent writer, \"is invested with peculiar sanctity, the origin of which would seem to be of high antiquity. That the present system of worship would seem to be a graft of the ancient Buddhist faith which obtained here, there can be no doubt. The edicts of Pyadasi testify abundantly that the hill of Girinagar and its neighbourhood was originally a stronghold of the Monotheists, whose form of worship has now degenerated into the modern system of Jainism.\" A mile eastward of the town of Junagarh, and four miles westward of the base of Girnar, is a rock, on which are engraved three inscriptions. That on the east side of the rock is in the antique Pali character, and sets forth a series of edicts of Pyadasi or Asoka, king of Pataliputra or Palibothra, and Nagadha, who began his reign B.C. 247. Those edicts, fourteen in number, vary in length from four or five to fourteen or fifteen lines, of about twenty-five letters each, laying down and enforcing the principal points of Buddhist faith and practice. According to Prinsep, \"Reverence to parents, love to neighbours, charity to the poor, and humanity to animal beings, were set forth as the sure and sufficient methods of gaining happiness in this world, and of propitiating heaven.\" Besides the Jainist edifices, there are a few Brahminical and Mussulmanic, and the whole mountain has no other inhabitants than the ministers\n\n---\n\n7 Journ.

Of this number two-thirds are stated to be Christians, of the Roman Catholic persuasion; but these are not under the direct jurisdiction of the Church of Rome, the throne of Portugal claiming the right of appointing its own bishop, and assuming the control and direction of the Catholic Church in its Indian possessions.\n\nThe settlement of Goa is divided into districts, which are again subdivided into parishes, the largest of which is Pangaum, containing the present seat of government, and about 10,000 souls. The harbour, which is a fine one, is formed by an arm of the sea, into which flows a small river, and is distant about five miles from the old city of Goa. The appearance of the harbour is of imposing beauty; but on reaching Pangaum, which is the new town and nearest to the harbour, all agreeable impressions vanish, the situation being low and sandy, and the houses wretched.\\(^2\\) Goa is connected with this place by a stone causeway about 300 yards long: though containing many fine buildings, churches, and monasteries, it is fast becoming a mass of deserted ruins\u2014miserable and squalid indications that there has been here a great city. Its inhabitants are almost entirely ecclesiastics. The military force of the state of Goa consists of 3,800 fighting men, of whom about 400 are Europeans. The revenues are estimated at 719,200 rupees, an amount stated to be annually exceeded by the expenditure.

Their discoveries received the first impulse from Henry, the fifth son of John, the first king of Portugal of that name. Under his auspices, several expeditions were fitted out for exploring the coast of Africa and the adjacent seas. The first discovery was not very important, but was sufficient to afford encouragement, and stimulate to perseverance. It consisted of the little island of Puerto Santo, so named from its having been discovered on the festival of All Saints. This was in the year 1418. In the following year the adventurers were further rewarded by the discovery of Madeira. For more than half a century, the voyages of the Portuguese were continued in the same direction, but in general without more important results than occasional additions to the small stock of geographical knowledge then existing. Little progress seemed to have been made towards the attainment of the grand object of these enterprises, viz. the discovery of a new route to India, till the latter end of the fifteenth century, when Bartholomew Dias eclipsed the fame of all preceding navigators, by his success in reaching the southernmost point of Africa, and in doubling the famous promontory called by himself Cabo Tormontoso, the Cape of Storms, but more happily and permanently designated by his sovereign, Cabo de Bona Esperanza, the Cape of Good Hope. Emanuel, the successor of John of Portugal, proceeded in the steps of his predecessor. An expedition was fitted out in furtherance of the object in view, and committed to the care of Vasco de Gama. It sailed from Lisbon on the 9th of July, 1497, doubled the Cape on the 20th of November...\"\nGOA.\n\nfollowing, and finally reached Calicut; thus achieving the triumph so long and so anxiously sought. The admiral was forthwith introduced to the native prince, a Hindoo, called by the Portuguese historians Zamorin, by native authorities, Samiri; and after a short stay, marked by alternations of friendliness and hostility, set sail on his return to Portugal, where he was received with the honours which he had so well earned.\n\n\"The Portuguese returned, and received permission to carry on the operations of commerce. But disputes soon arose, and acts of violence were committed on both sides. The power and influence of the Portuguese, however, continued to extend, and the assistance afforded by them to the neighbouring king of Cochin, in his quarrel with the Zamorin, was rewarded by permission to erect a fort for their protection within the territories of the former prince. Thus was laid the foundation of the Portuguese dominion in the East. An attempt to obtain possession of Calicut failed. Against Goa the invaders were more successful. That city was taken by storm; and although subsequently retaken by a native force, was again captured by the Portuguese, and became the seat of their government, the capital of their Indian dominions, and the see of an archbishop, the primate of the Indies.\"\n\nThe Dutch supplanted the Portuguese as traders, and with their commerce the latter nation lost their power and grandeur. Thus did Goa become the melancholy spectacle which it is now, and which it will continue to present until some further step in downward progress shall sink it still lower into wretchedness and degradation, or unless by some happy incident it should become absorbed into the British territories.\n\nGOA, or GWA.\u2014A populous village in the district of Sandoway, in the province of Arracan.

Goalpara, or North-Eastern Rungpore, in a geographical point of view, belongs to Bengal proper, having constituted an integral part of that province in 1765, when the British government obtained the grant of the Dewanny from the emperor of Delhi; but from the circumstance of its being placed under the superintendence of the commissioner of Assam, and from its general resemblance in respect of climate and other circumstances to that province, it has sometimes been regarded as one of the districts of Assam.\\(^3\\) Goalpara, the principal town of the district, suffered severely by fire in 1838.\\(^4\\) Lat. \\(26^\\circ 8'\\), long. \\(90^\\circ 40'\\).\n\n**GOAS.**\u2014A town in the British district of Moorshedabad, presidency of Bengal, 114 miles N. of Calcutta.

Taking a direction south-east for 100 miles, it reaches the western frontier of the territory of the Nizam at Phooltamba, in lat. $19^\\circ 48'$, long. $74^\\circ 40'$, and continuing to hold the same direction for ninety miles further, forms the boundary between the collectorate of Ahmednuggur and the territory of the Nizam, to a point ten miles beyond Mongee, in lat. $19^\\circ 23'$, long. $75^\\circ 37'$, having previously, at Toka, in lat. $19^\\circ 37'$, long. $75^\\circ 2'$, received on the right side the river Paira, flowing from the west. Below Mongee the Godavery enters the Nizam's territory, after which it proceeds in a sinuous, but generally easterly course, for 160 miles, to the vicinity of Lasona, and receives on the left side, in lat. $19^\\circ 6'$, long. $77^\\circ 5'$, the Doodna, a considerable stream flowing from the north-west. From that confluence, taking a course south-east for eighty-five miles, in lat. $18^\\circ 48'$, long. $77^\\circ 55'$, it receives on the right side the Manjara, a large river flowing from the south. The course of the Godavery after this confluence is still sinuous, but generally eastward, for about 170 miles, to the town of Veel Saugor, in lat. $18^\\circ 48'$, long. $79^\\circ 49'$, near which the Manair river falls into it; thence flowing for about twenty miles to Kulaisur, in lat. $18^\\circ 52'$, long. $79^\\circ 55'$, it receives on the left side the Wain Gunga (there termed the Prauheetta), a large river from the north, which discharges the great drainage of the southern declivity of the Vindhya range. Thence the Godavery takes a direction south-east for 170 miles, to Kottoor, in lat. $17^\\circ 29'$, long. $81^\\circ 34'$, where it crosses the frontier into the British district of Rajahmundry, finding its way through a deep chasm in the Eastern Ghats, with a very slight declivity. About twenty-five miles below Kottoor, it issues from the mountains at Polaveram, in lat. $17^\\circ 15'$, long. $81^\\circ 42'$. In passing through the great barrier of hills, it is stated by the boatmen who navigate the river, that there are no falls throughout the length of its channel, nor indeed any obstructions of importance; and the testimony of these persons would appear to be confirmed by the fact, that large timber-rafts from the Nizam's territory are floated down when the river is almost at its lowest, and has\n\n* The elevation of the source does not appear to have been registered, but may with probability be conjectured at 3,000 feet.\nnot more than two or three feet water at the fords in the low country. From Polaveram the river continues to hold a direction south-east for twenty-three miles, to Pechakalunka, in lat. $16^\\circ 57'$, long. $81^\\circ 49'$, where, entering the alluvial country which it has itself formed, it diverges into two great branches, the left flowing to the south-east for fifty-five miles, and falling into the Bay of Bengal at Point Gordeware,\\(^4\\) in lat. $16^\\circ 48'$, long. $82^\\circ 23'$; the right taking a southern direction for fifty-five miles, and falling into the bay at Narsipur, lat. $16^\\circ 18'$, long. $81^\\circ 46'$.\n\nThe alluvial country traversed by the two streams spreads out on both sides, extending on the west till it meets the delta of the Kistnah, at the Colair Lake, a distance of about forty miles; and on the east side spreading for about thirty-two miles, to the shore of Coringa Bay, where the coast runs for some distance nearly north and south.\n\nFrom the hills the river has a very moderate fall. At Polaveram, where, as already stated, it issues from the mountains, the alluvial land forming its banks is eighty feet above the level of the sea at high water. This land has a very regular slope, commencing with a foot and a half per mile, and gradually diminishing to one foot as it approaches the sea. But as the rise and fall of the river at Polaveram amounts to thirty-eight feet, its summer surface at that place cannot exceed forty-two feet above the sea-level, which gives an average fall of seven inches and a half per mile. At the head of the delta, the bed of the ford is twenty-two feet above the sea, and the actual distance being about fifty miles, the fall is little more than five inches per mile.\n\nBesides the slope of the land towards the sea in the delta, it has another and much more abrupt slope in a direction lateral to the course of the river. The banks of the river on both sides form ridges, rising several feet above the level of the land beyond. This ridge-like character is common to rivers which overflow their banks without restraint, as for instance the Nile, and is well known to arise from the deposit of the heavier matter near to the margin of the river, while the finer and lighter is carried to the limits of the inundation. The delta inclosed between these two great arms is traversed by many smaller branches diverging from them. An offset from the\n\n\\(^4\\) Horburgh, East-India Directory, i. 608.\nGODAVERY.\n\ngreat north-eastern branch flows by the town of Coringa, and admits vessels of ten or twelve feet draught. The branch which disembogues at Narsipur is less suited for the purposes of navigation, admitting only vessels drawing eight or nine feet water. In December, 1846, the sanction of the Court of Directors was given to the construction, at an expense of 47,500l., of a dam or annicut of sufficient height to command the delta of the river, and to supply to the rich alluvial soil of which that tract is composed, the means of constant irrigation. In 1848 the amount had been expended, but the works were far from completion, and a further sum, equal to 13,900l., was assigned for that object. The annicut, 4,200 yards long, has been thrown across the river near the village of Dowlasweram on the east bank, and Wadapillay on the west. For boats and timber that may be required to pass down or up the river when there is neither so much water as to allow of their passing over the annicut, nor so little as to prevent their navigating the river, locks are constructed at the heads of the irrigating channels, by means of which a communication between the upper and lower stream is maintained round the annicut. At the town of Rajahmundry, a few miles above the point where the river divaricates, the channel is of great width, and during the periodical inundations in the close of summer, is filled from bank to bank with a vast and rapid body of water, bearing down great quantities of timber, wrecks of wooden houses, and carcasses of animals; but during the dry season the current shrinks so much, that it might in most places be forded. The construction of the annicut already noticed has, however, changed this, by retaining, for the benefit both of agriculture and navigation, a never-failing supply of water, previously suffered to flow in useless abundance to the sea.\n\nThe long gorge by which the river finds its way through the Eastern Ghats, though having so slight a declivity as to admit of navigation, allows the channel a space of not more than a quarter of a mile, with banks rising on each side into mountains so steep and high, that travelling along the stream by land is altogether impracticable, and communication can be maintained by navigation only. Above the gorge, the volume of water in the upper or more level country expands during inundations to a width of from three to six miles on each side.\nof the river, and on the retiring of the stream, the soil remains covered with a black alluvial mud, which imparts to it great fertility. The total length of the Godavery from its source to Narsipur is 898 miles.\n\nThe value of this river as an instrument of communication for commercial and military purposes is perhaps not yet fully appreciated. It appears, that from Mahadepoor to Rajahmundry the voyage in boats properly adapted to the purpose has been performed in fifty-two hours; and it is inferred, with great appearance of probability, that steamers similar to those used on the Ganges might ascend the Godavery to a considerable distance, affording great facility for conveying troops and stores to Nagpore and Jubbulpore, as well as a mode of transmitting to the eastern coast the produce of Berar and the Nagpore territories, far more advantageous than the land route by carts and bullocks. The passage from Chanda, on one of the feeders of the Godavery, to Mahadepoor, has been performed in eighteen hours; and it has been suggested, that by means of this great river and its tributaries an uninterrupted water-communication might be obtained from the coast into the heart of the Deccan. The experiment of navigating the Godavery by means of steam has been entertained by the government of Madras, and measures for carrying it into effect are under consideration.\n\nGODHUL.\u2014A town in the native state of Hyderabad, or territory of the Nizam, 69 miles S. from Hyderabad, and 34 miles S.E. from Ghunnapoora.

It is bounded on the north by the British district of Ahmedabad; on the east and south-east by the Gulf of Cambay and Ahmedabad; on the west by the districts of Babriawar and Kattiar; on the north-west by the district of Kattiar; and lies between lat. \\(20^\\circ 56'\\)\u2014\\(22^\\circ 3'\\), long. \\(71^\\circ 14'\\)\u2014\\(72^\\circ 13'\\). It is eighty-five miles in length from north-east to south-west, and sixty in breadth. The seacoast, commencing at its southwestern extremity, at the mouth of the small river Jullanu, in lat. \\(20^\\circ 56'\\), long. \\(71^\\circ 30'\\), extends in a direction nearly due north-east about forty miles, to Jaunjmeer, in lat. \\(21^\\circ 12'\\), long. \\(72^\\circ 6'\\). It is rather bold in some places, but it is not in general safe for large ships to approach, being beset with detached rocks from\\(^2\\) half a mile to three quarters of a mile from the shore. Towards the north-eastern part, however, there are fewer of these obstacles to coasting navigation; but though many small estuaries occur, there is no shelter for\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) E.I.C.

In Mowa Bay, one of the few places where a large vessel can put in, \"the anchorage is bad, the bottom being sand, from seven to ten fathoms; and with the flood tide a vessel must lie with a reef of rocks right astern.\" At Jaunjmeer, or Gopnath Point, as that part of the shore is also called, the coast takes a direction nearly northward, as far as Alung, at the southern extremity of an isolated portion of the British district of Ahmedabad, and in lat. $21^\\circ 24'$, long. $72^\\circ 10'$. The coast here forming part of the western shore of the Gulf of Cambay, is rather dangerous, requiring much vigilance for its safe navigation, in consequence of a shoal of considerable extent nearly level with the water at neap-tides. The coast belonging to the British district terminates at the estuary of the river Gaila, near Bhownuggur, and in lat. $21^\\circ 48'$, long. $72^\\circ 12'$, and that of Gobilwar recommences, extending in a northerly direction for ten miles, to its extremity at Gondalla; but this is of no great avail for the purposes of navigation, in consequence of the great shallowness of the Gulf of Cambay in its northern part. Like most other parts of the peninsula of Guzerat, this district abounds in streams, all rising in the high land in the interior, and discharging themselves into the Gulf of Cambay. Of those the most considerable is the Setroonjee, which, rising on the eastern declivity of the Girnar Mountain, near Junagarh, holds an easterly course of about thirty miles through the district of Kattiw\u00e4r; thence in the same direction for twelve miles, through that of Und Surna; and touching on this district in lat. $21^\\circ 26'$, long. $71^\\circ 46'$, flows nearly due eastward for about ten miles, forming the boundary between this district and that of Und Surna; and at that distance entering Gohilwar, it turns south-eastward, and flows sixteen miles to its embouchure in the Gulf of Cambay. It has probably the largest perennial volume of water of any stream in the peninsula. The other streams, though large torrents during the rains, are generally nearly devoid of water in the dry season. The principal mountains are the Wulluk group, in the southern part of the peninsula, and the Palitayna group, in the middle. There is another group, the Seroi, of less magnitude. This district is a fertile one, producing most kinds of grain known in India, and exporting a considerable quantity. It, amongst other fruits, pro-\nduces the mango in perfection, and has the only forest of those trees to be met with in the peninsula. The principal towns\u2014Limri, Palitayna, Mowa or Mahowa, and Tulaji or Taloja\u2014are noticed under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement. The district contains 690 towns and villages, and the aggregate population\\(^7\\) has been computed to be 247,980. The chief, styled the Rawul Raja, or Thakoor of Bhaonagar, has an income estimated\\(^8\\) some years since at 740,000 rupees annually, and pays a tribute of 81,950 rupees to the British government, and 39,202 to the Guicowar. Bhaonagar, his capital, is within the jurisdiction of the British district of Ahmedabad; and this being regarded an humiliating circumstance, has sometimes suggested to this affluent chief the removal of his residence to some town within his own.\n\nGOHUD,\\(^1*\\) in the territory of Gwalior, or the possessions of the family of Scindia, a town on the route from Etawa to Gwalior, 55\\(^2\\) miles S.W. of the former, and 28 N.E. of the latter. Its fortifications consist of an outer curtain of mud, faced with stone, and inclose an extensive area, between which and the citadel are two other walls.\\(^3\\) The citadel is lofty, with massive towers, and has spacious and commodious apartments. Around the outermost rampart runs a ditch,\\(^4\\) which can be filled with water from the small river Besulee. Tieffenthaler, describing the condition of the place seventy years ago, states it to be then populous and rich. It is now, however, much decayed, though there are a few good modern houses, especially that of the Mahratta governor. The rana of Gohud was originally a Jat zemindar or landholder, who, in the early part of the eighteenth century, rose to considerable power by taking advantage of the opportunities for aggrandizement which were common during that troubled period. In 1779, he secured the alliance of the British government, from whom, in the following year, he received most valuable aid against the Mahrattas. Among other services, the fort of Gwalior, previously reputed impregnable, was captured by a British force under Captain Popham, and placed in the possession of the rana of Gohud. Here, however, in 1784,\\(^5\\) the rana was besieged by Madhajee Scindia, and obliged to surrender. His capital, Gohud, also\n\n* Gohad of Tassin; Gohad of the Urdu writers;\\(^1\\) Gohud generally of the British writers.\\(^2\\)\nGOH\u2014GOK.\n\npassed into the hands of the enemy. In 1803, negotiations were opened by the British government with the rana of Gohud, and a treaty was concluded, by which certain territorial possessions were guaranteed to that chief. The right of the British thus to deal with the territory in question was, however, impugned by Scindia, and, in consequence, a new arrangement was effected. Gohud was transferred to Scindia, and the rana received from the British government the territory of Dholpoor, which his descendant still enjoys.

Here is a ferry across that river to Mohunpur, on the right bank, six miles S.E. of Muttra cantonment. It is a place of some note among the Hindoos, from its association with the memory of one of their revered sages. Wilson observes: \"Vallabhi Swami, the son of Lakshmana Batt, a Tailinga Brahman\u2014This Sanyasi taught early in the sixteenth century; he resided originally at Gokul, a village on the left bank of the Jumna, about three cos to the east of Mathura.\" It is also regarded by some as the place where Vishnu first appeared on earth, in the form of Krishna.

The fortress, situated on a rocky ridge of granite, is extensive, and contains many inclosures. It is altogether very strong,\u00b2 and in good repair; but is commanded within breaching distance by the summits of several of the enormous and massive mausolea of the ancient kings of the place. Being the depository of the treasures of the Nizam, and also used as a state prison, it is very strictly guarded, and entrance cannot be obtained by any but official persons in confidential capacity. The ancient mausolea form a vast group, about 600 yards from the fort, in an arid, desert, rocky ground, the stern features of which heighten the impressiveness and grandeur of those astonishing buildings. \"Desolate,\"\u00b3 and abandoned to the ravages of time, they rear their stately domes and pinnacles on the bare plain, no outward defences now existing to ward off the approaches of any assailant, who, through ignorance or wantonness, may hasten the progress of decay. The most ancient of these tombs is not more than 300 years old; but they have been subjected to so many and such barbarous attacks, that nothing save the great solidity of their walls has preserved them from utter ruin. Each mausoleum stands in\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.\n\u00b2 As. Journ. xxvi.

The body of the building, also quadrangular, rises about thirty feet above the upper terrace of this arcade, and is also surrounded by a balustrade, flanked with minarets of smaller dimensions than those below. From the centre of this portion of the building springs the dome, forming by its magnitude a distinguished feature in a structure equally remarkable for the splendour and symmetry of its proportions. The principal material employed is grey granite, ornamented in some parts with stucco, and in others with the porcelain tiles for which India was at one time so famous. The colours retain their brilliancy to the present day, and the extracts from the Koran, formed of white characters on a polished blue ground, have all the richness of enamel. There is a mosque attached to each of these tombs, which formerly possessed the privileges of sanctuary; and those religious edifices not only supported a considerable number of priests, but also afforded a daily meal to the neighbouring poor.\"\n\n\"These tombs were erected at a great expense, some of them being said to have cost 150,000l. The enamelled-work with which they are ornamented is reported to have been the production of artists brought from China for the purpose; but there is every reason to believe that these decorations are of native workmanship, similar ornaments being to be found at Beejapore, Agra, Behar, Bengal, and other places.\" The diamonds of Golconda have obtained great celebrity throughout the world; but they were merely cut and polished here, having been generally found at Parteall, in a detached portion of the Nizam's dominions, near the southern frontier, in lat. 16\u00b0 40', long. 80\u00b0 28', a place which affords no favourable indication of the wealth to be derived from the avocation of seeking diamonds, as it is in ruins, and the inhabitants ill-clothed, and half-starved in appearance.\n\nGolconda, in former times, was a large and powerful kingdom of the Deccan, which arose on the dissolution of the Bahmani empire, but being subdued by Aurungzebe, was incorporated with the empire under his rule. Even in its\nextinction, however, it was able to maintain some struggle, and even to venture on an attack upon the imperial army, and to plunder its baggage. The confusion consequent upon the breaking up of the empire almost obliterated the recollection of the once flourishing kingdom of Golconda.

After a course of about 160 miles, it is lost in the sands to the east of the Suliman range. Its bed for a great distance forms the Goolairee Pass, or great middle route from Hindostan to Khorasan, by Dera Ismael Khan and Ghuznee, the northern being through the Khyber Pass, and the southern through the Bolan. It crosses the Suliman range about lat. $32^\\circ 6'$.\n\n**GOMUL.**\u2014A village in the Daman division of the Punjab, on the road from Ghuznee to Dera Ismael Khan, and 40 miles W. of the latter place.

It may, however, be considered as lying between lat. 19\u00b0 50' and 24\u00b0 30', long. 77\u00b0 38' and 87\u00b0 20', and as comprising part of the British districts of Saugor and Nerbudda, and also those of Singrowli, Chota Nagpore, and Sirgooja, with the petty native states on the south-west frontier of Bengal, the Cuttack Mehals, and the greater portion of the northern part of the dominions of the rajah of Berar or Nagpore. It is throughout a hilly tract, comprising within its limits the eastern portion of the Vindhya and Mahadeo Mountains, and having in some places a considerable elevation, stated, though perhaps without sufficient grounds, to be at Amarkantak 5,000 feet above the sea. Its great elevation in some parts is, however, proved by the fact that rivers take their course northward, as the Betwa and others of less importance, which flow into the Jumna or Ganges; eastward, as the Mahanuddy, to the Bay of Bengal; and westward, as the Nerbudda and Taptee, with their tributaries, to the Indian Ocean.\n\nMany extensive tracts, especially the eastern, are pathless jungly wilds, regarded by the more civilized borderers on them as \"the abode only of wild beasts, demons, and savage Goonds.\" So difficult, indeed, is the eastern part of the country, that perhaps no instance occurs of a large body of troops marching through it between the Deccan and Hindostan; and so little known is the route which Garden lays down through it from Hazareebagh to Nagpore, that merely the distances of the halting-places are given, unaccompanied by\n\n* Gondwana of Tassin; Gondwarra according to Malcolm, who states that it \"means literally the country of the Gonds;\" Gondwana of Briggs's Index.\n\n1 E.I.C.

It is observed in a late publication, that \"this belt [Gondwana], which has in all ages formed a marked barrier between the great and fluctuating empires prevailing in the northern and southern portions of Hindostan, and which further west forms but a narrow strip between the two great arenas, here [eastward] commences expanding into much more formidable dimensions. We find that very rarely was any portion of it chosen as the route by which armies passed to and fro, and as rarely was the eye of the foreign despot or adventurer directed towards its then uninviting wilds as an object of conquest.\" The western part, however, bordering on Malwa, Bhopal, and Berar, is in many places fertile and well watered; and the vicinity of Nagpoor, Hoshungabad, and Saugor, is the seat of considerable civilization, and has been the scene of many important political and military events. The Goonds, who form the greater portion of the population of Gondwana, have been conjectured to be the aborigines of Hindostan, and speak a language radically different from Sanscrit and its dialects, introduced from regions west of the Indus. Many of the Goonds seen by Blunt in his passage through the country were so devoid of any approach to civilization as to live in a state of entire nudity. They appeared, however, to be an athletic, well-looking race.*\n\nThe soil and climate, though not remarkable for salubrity, are in many places very favourable to productiveness, while the rocks abound in iron and the forests contain fine timber. Perhaps, however, the savage, neglected aspect of a large part of the country, and the barbarism of its population, may be attributed rather to the insalubrious air brooding in the jungly valleys, and to obstacles to communication caused by the\n\n* Hamilton states: \"They have usually broad and rather flat noses, and thick lips, with not unfrequently curly hair when young.\" He makes a farther statement, which is, however, of little value, from the want of definite localities and authorities:\u2014\"The old designations of the principal tracts, up to 1817, were the following, commencing at the northern extremity:\u20141. Chandail; 2. Boghela; 3. Billounja; 4. Singrowla; 5. Raja Chohans; 6. Manwas; 7. Canroody; 8. Sohagepoor; 9. Sirgoosa; 10. Odeypoor; 11. Koorba; 12. Jushpur; 13. Gangpoor; 14. Sumbhulpoor; 15.

Bustar.\"\nnumerous ridges, ravines, and torrents, rather than to any inherent inaptitude of the Goonds for civilization. Where encouraged, they readily and efficiently toil at timber-cutting, mining, and other laborious tasks. Their present state is described by a recent traveller in their wilds, who, however, does not agree on all points with a traveller already quoted. \"This caste of Hindoos are almost jet black, and dirty and forbidding in their appearance, while they are short in stature and thickset in point of make: their dialect is peculiar to themselves. The whole race appears wretched and poor; a small dhotee (breech-cloth), and a coarse chadar (sheet), to wrap over their bodies, form their outward garments. Their tenements consist of huts, whose walls are built of stakes cut from the neighbouring forests, entwined with rude wickerwork, and plastered and besmeared over with mud; while the roofs consist of a thin layer or coating of dried grass, over which are spread some leaves, and a few battens made of bamboo fastened over all, to prevent it from being acted upon by the wind. The Goonds are remarkably fond of swine and buffaloes; they are fond also of rearing fowls. When leaving the road and penetrating the forest depths, an occasional hut is met with completely isolated; and from such I have seen a Goond issue forth, its only human tenant, while a favourite pig has met my eye not far from the threshold. This race of human beings are little better in the human scale than demi-savages; they are very superstitious, and, like all dark minds, place great confidence and belief in the charms and quackery of their goorooos or priests. They have rites peculiar to themselves, and tread the jungle-depths at dead of night without the slightest feeling of dread or fear from tigers or other wild beasts. It has often been a matter of surprise to me that these men should dare, both by day and night, to traverse and thread these deep forests unapprehensive of danger from wild beasts, especially tigers, which in these parts are fearfully abundant.\" Among the more secluded tribes, human sacrifices are frequent; and a late writer charges them with the incredible atrocity of cutting the throats of sick persons, and devouring their carcases. Whether or not the latter abomination was at any time customary, it is certain that the former prevailed until a very late period. The meri-\nGONDWANA.\n\ntorious, and it is believed successful, efforts of the British government to put an end to human sacrifices are adverted to in the article \"Goomsoor.\" A learned writer\\(^6\\) sententiously, and in some respects more favourably, describes these people as \"the aboriginal inhabitants of the Saugor territory, a simple primitive race, now chiefly confined to the hilly tracts, though some have been tempted to settle in the plains. Their great characteristics are the love of truth, drunkenness, and superstition.\"\n\nStirling\\(^7\\) says: \"The Khoonds are found in great numbers in all the hill estates south of the Mahanadi. They form the principal part of the population of Killah Ranpur, which has thence been called Kandreh Daudpat. The natives also have the idea of a district situated between Duspalla, Boad, and Goomsoor, inhabited entirely by this tribe of hill people, which they call Khondra. I believe that the vast unexplored tracts of mountain and forest lying at the back of the Ganjam and Vizagapatam hill estates, down as far as the Godaveri, are peopled chiefly by Khoonds in a very savage state, who differ probably very little from their neighbours the Gonds, though Captain Blunt observes, on the authority of the jaghiredar of Malwa and Manikpatam, that the Coands (Khoonds) and Goands (Gonds) are to be considered quite distinct races.\"\n\nIn Bundlecund,\\(^8\\) to the north of Saugor, the chief of the Raj-Goonds, claiming royal lineage, is regarded with great deference by the Goonds of that quarter. The representative of the Goond family, formerly sovereign of Deogarh, receives a pension from the Nagpore government: the Goond family of Garha Mandla has a similar provision from the British. The history of a race so rude must obviously be scanty and obscure. The Goond rajah Nursing Rae is represented\\(^9\\) in 1399 to have been powerful and wealthy; but his greatness was overthrown\\(^1\\) in 1433, by Hooshung, the Mussulman monarch of Malwa, who, having slain him in battle, reduced Kehrila, his capital. Subsequently, in 1513, the Goond chiefs are found forming\\(^2\\) a powerful confederacy against the king of Malwa. The western part was subjugated\\(^3\\) by Akbar, and included within the fiscal organization of his empire; Kehrila, the capital of the principal Goond rajah, being mentioned in the Ayeen Akbery\\(^4\\) as chief place of a circar of the soubah of\nBerar. The eastern part, as remarked by Rennell, was neither reduced by Akbar, nor even known in particulars to the author of the Ayeen Akbery.* The rajah of Deogarh, in this part of Gondwana, was, in the latter part of the seventeenth century, induced to profess Mahomedanism by the influence of Aurungzebe; and in 1744, his sons having embroiled themselves with Ragoghee Bhonsla, were by him deprived of their possessions, which he incorporated with his own. Ragoghee in the previous year had overrun and partially subjugated Western Gondwana. There is henceforward little to relate until the operations of the British forces in the Nagpore dominions in 1818-19. Appa Sahib Bhonsla, the rajah of Berar, having fled from Nagpore, his capital, took refuge among the Mahadeo Mountains, in Western Gondwana. The British forces tracked him with unwearied perseverance through those intricate wilds, and, successively gaining his fastnesses and lurking-places, obliged him to fly in disguise. Another British armament overrunning Southern Gondwana, stormed the fortified town of Chanda; a third marching into South-eastern Gondwana, stormed the town of Kompta, and took military occupation of the neighbouring country. By the treaty of Nagpore, in 1818, the British government acquired the extensive tract now denominated the Saugor and Nerbudda territory, with other considerable tracts in the northern portion of Gondwana. It may, however, be observed in conclusion, that the name Gondwana must be regarded as obsolete.\n\nGONDWARA.\u2014A town in the British district of Purneah, presidency of Bengal.

A discovery had been made that this horrible practice prevailed to a considerable extent among the Khoonds, a barbarous people inhabiting the adjacent frontier tracts. Recourse was had in the first instance to conciliatory means, by which it was hoped the civilization of the Khoonds might be effected; but the experiment, though continued through a series of years,\\(^3\\) failed in presenting any prospect of ultimate success; and in 1845, a commission for the suppression of Meriah sacrifices was appointed by the Indian government.\\(^4\\) Disturbances again broke out, attended with great destruction of life and property, and it became necessary to call in military aid.\\(^5\\) The insurgents were defeated, and peace restored. Several chiefs have been induced to enter into formal engagements to abandon the practice\\(^6\\) of human sacrifices and female infanticide, on condition of British protection; and these barbarous rites are now considered as effectually suppressed.\\(^7\\) The town of Goomsoor is in lat. \\(19^\\circ 50'\\), long. \\(84^\\circ 40'\\).\n\nGOOMTEE.\u2014A river rising in lat. \\(23^\\circ 43'\\), long. \\(92^\\circ 24'\\), in the native territory known as Independent Tipperah, and flowing through that state in a westerly direction for eighty miles, and for sixty miles through British Tipperah, falls into the Megna or Brahmapootra river, in lat. \\(23^\\circ 32'\\), long. \\(90^\\circ 42'\\).\n\nGOOMTEE.\\(^*\\)\u2014A river rising in the British district of\n\n* Gumti of Tassin; Gumte of Richardson;\\(^1\\) Gomati and Gumti of Wilford,\\(^2\\) and also Vasishti of the same author; the river of J\u00f4npur, and also the G\u00fbi of Baber or his translators.

According to the surveyor-general's map, Fuljur Tal, the source of the Goomtee river, is a small lake or morass, in lat. $28^\\circ 35'$, long. $80^\\circ 10'$, and nineteen miles east of the town of Pilleebheet. As the elevation of Pilleebheet above the sea is estimated at 517 feet, and the intervening country is remarkably level,\u2020 the source of the Goomtee may be assumed as about 520 feet above the sea. It takes a course sinuous, but generally to the south-east, for the distance of forty-two miles, when it crosses into the territory of Oude, and according to the surveyor-general's map, it, at the distance of about ninety-four miles from its source, in lat. $27^\\circ 28'$, long. $80^\\circ 27'$, receives on the left side a stream flowing from the north, and having a course of about forty miles. From this confluence the Goomtee continues its progress in its previous direction for about eighty miles, to Lucknow, receiving during its course the Suraru. It is at that city navigable, and crossed by a bridge either of brick\u2021 or of stone. Rennell describes\u00b2 it to be at that place \"a small river,\" and Lumsden,\u00b3 \"a paltry and narrow stream;\" but according to Von Orlich,\u2074 a bridge of boats traversing the stream, below that of masonry, is 240 paces in length; and the same traveller states than an iron bridge of three arches, sent out in pieces from England, to traverse the river, was calculated for a width of 200 paces. The river certainly admits of navigation to an important extent; a small\u00a7 steamer belonging to the king of Oude having\n\n* Hamilton states,\u00b9 \"This river has its source in northern Hindostan, among the hills of Kumaon, from whence it flows in a south-easterly direction nearly parallel with the Goggra.\" Butter\u00b2 correctly states that it has its origin in the Terrai of Rohilcund.\n\n\u2020 According to Butter,\u00b9 the general surface of the adjoining Oude territory \"is a plain declining to the east-south-east, at the rate of about seven inches in the mile.\"\n\n\u2021 Of stone, according to Von Orlich;\u00b9 of brick, according to Garden.\u00b2\n\n\u00a7 It was launched in 1820; the dimensions were as follows:\n\n| Length between perpendiculars | .. | .. | 50 ft. 0 in. |\n| Breadth, moulded | .. | .. | .. | 8 10 |\n| Ditto, extreme | .. | .. | .. | 9 10 |\n| Depth | .. | .. | .. | 4 0 |\n| Engine 8-horse power.

Tiefenthaler observes that the breadth of the river is more remarkable than its depth. Though its value for the purposes of navigation and irrigation is great, the water, according to Butter, is often contaminated by gross impurities, and occasionally becomes the source of disease. \"During the rainy season, the water of the Goomtee is loaded with an immense quantity of yellow clay, and becomes unfit for drinking; and when any great mortality prevails at Lucknow, or along the banks of the river, a putrid scum forms on its surface, occasioned by the number of dead bodies thrown into it.\" Fish, however, so abound in it, that Butter estimates that a fifth of the population draws its subsistence from that source. It is greatly affected by the periodical rains, rising and falling annually from that cause about fifteen feet; and according to tradition, the variation formerly was much greater.\n\nAt all times \"it is excellently adapted for navigation, its waters never dispersing themselves over a greater breadth than 140 yards, and having generally a depth of four feet in the driest season; while its excessive windings, which lengthen its course seventy-five per cent., answer the purpose of canal locks in diminishing slope and rapidity. It is, however, intersected at every four or six miles by kankar (calcareous conglomerate) ridges of two or three yards in width, which in the dry season sometimes diminish the depth to two feet. These ridges might be removed at no great expense, were the political condition of the country such as to give its natural importance to the trade between central Oude and the British provinces. At present, the few boats which convey supplies to Lucknow return empty. During the rainy season, boats of 1,000 or 1,200 maunds (forty tons) are sometimes seen proceeding to Lucknow.\" The river continues its course in a south-easterly direction from Lucknow, and about seventy miles below, it, according to the surveyor-general's map, receives on the left side, in lat. 26\u00b0 42', long. 81\u00b0 40', the Kuliani, a stream flowing from the north-west, and having a course of about eighty miles. Below this confluence, the river's right bank is in general high, and consists of solid kankar; the left, low and sandy. At the station of Sultanpoor, about 170 miles south-east of Lucknow by the river's course, eighty in direct line, the stream is in the dry season 100 yards wide, with a mean depth of four feet, and a current of\ntwo miles an hour. About fifty-two miles lower down, and in the same direction, it passes over the frontier into the British district of Jounpoor, and flows through it thirty miles, to the town of the same name, where its breadth is such as to require a bridge\\(^3\\) of sixteen fine arches. About eighteen miles below that town, on the right side, it receives the river Sai; thirty-three miles lower down, in its course by the district of Benares, on the same side, the Nind; and five miles below the last confluence, and in lat. \\(25^\\circ 29'\\), long. \\(88^\\circ 15'\\), it falls into the Ganges on the left side, after a total course of 482\\(^*\\) miles. Close above its mouth, it is crossed by means of a bridge\\(^4\\) of boats from the middle of October to the middle of June, and during the rains by ferry.\n\nGOOMY.\u2014A town in the native mehal of Purlahkemedy, on the S.W. frontier of Bengal, 54 miles N. from Ganjam, and 66 miles N.W. from Juggernaut.

In approaching this pass from the south side, the road first proceeds upwards by the course of the Rupin, a feeder of the river Tons. The valley through which this river flows is terminated abruptly by a steep ridge, down which the stream pours in a cascade above 100 feet high. The ascent is by a path winding up by this stream, and proceeding over an expanse of snow to the crest of the pass, 16,026\\(^2\\) feet above the sea. The inclination of the mountain-slope on the northern side is more gradual, but still very difficult, being, as far as the eye can reach,\\(^3\\) a dreary expanse of snow.

It is situate on the river of the same name, where it receives a small torrent called the Kuttagee. Water consequently may readily be obtained, and even when the rivers have ceased to run, it may be had from pools or wells dug in their beds. The country hereabouts is very rocky and barren, and supplies are scanty. Lat. 25\u00b0 4', long. 67\u00b0 28'.\n\nGOORBAN.\u2014A river in Sinde, so called from a village of that name on its bank. It rises in the mountainous tract\nbetween Kurrachee and Sehwan, about lat. 25\u00b0 14', long. 67\u00b0 36', and, after a south-westerly course of about sixty miles, falls into the Bay of Kurrachee by the Gisree creek, in lat. 24\u00b0 47', long. 67\u00b0 8'. Like most of the streams in this part of Sinde, it is known by different names in different parts of its course; being called Vuddia near its source, Goorban in the middle, and Mulleeree lower down. Though occasionally flooded, and having then a considerable body of water, it is dry for the greater part of the year; but water, as stated in the preceding article, may at all times be obtained by digging in its bed. It is crossed by the route from Kurrachee to Sehwan, at the village of Goorban.\n\nGOORDAH, in the territory of Bhurtapore, a village on the route from Agra to Ajmeer, 48\u00b2 miles W. of former, 180 E. of latter. It is situate on the Baun or Ootunghun, \"where\u00b2 the bed is about three-quarters of a mile wide, and of heavy sand. From November to July there is little water in the river, and from being so much spread out at the Ghat, it is but seldom unfordable any length of time in the rains.\" Lat. 27\u00b0 3', long. 77\u00b0 20'.\n\nGOOREA-TEEKA, or GURIALI, in Gurwhal, a pass over a ridge having a south-easterly direction from Surkanda summit to the right bank of the Bhageerettee, as the Ganges is called in the upper part of its course.

Lat. 28\u00b0 24', long. 78\u00b0 32'.\n\nGOORGAON, a British district under the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces, is bounded on the north by the jaghire of Jujhur and the British district of Delhi; on the east by the jaghire of Bullubgurh and the river Jumna, separating it from the British districts of Boolundshubur and Allygurh; on the south by the British district of Muttra, and by Tijarra and the territory of Bhurtpoor; and on the west by Tijarra and Jujhur. It lies between lat. 27\u00b0 40'\u201428\u00b0 30', long. 76\u00b0 21'\u201477\u00b0 35', and contains an area\u00b2 of 1,942 square miles. The population amounts to 460,326,\nGOORGAON.\n\nof whom 176,328 are returned as Hindoo and agricultural; 105,180 Hindoo non-agricultural; 109,792 as Mahomedans, and others not being Hindoos, agricultural; and 69,026 of the like classes non-agricultural. There are four towns,* containing each between 5,000 and 10,000 inhabitants, and two\u2020 containing upwards of 10,000. The climate is for the greater part of the year dry\u00a7 and hot. The general elevation of the country is about 820 feet above Calcutta, or 840 above the sea; that of the town of Goorgaon being fixed by a scientific observer at 817. Some parts are, however, considerably higher. Jacquemont\u2074 estimates the height of the hills about Soonah at more than 400 feet above the general level of the country; and Fraser\u2076 mentions some which rise 600 feet above it. The part extending along the right bank of the Jumna\u2077 is low, level, and in many places rather fertile, though, long after the cause had ceased to operate, it continued to be overrun with jungle, the consequence of the neglect of cultivation, produced by the incessant devastation by the Mahrattas and other freebooters, previously to the conquest of the country by the British. Heber,\u2078 who passed in 1825, observes, it \u201cis still but badly cultivated; but fifteen years ago it was as wild, I am assured, as the Terrai, as full of tigers, and with no human inhabitants but banditti.\u201d The progress of improvement, however, seems to have been rapid, as Jacquemont,\u2079 five years later, describes the country as rather well cultivated; and more recently a further stimulus has been given to agricultural industry by the revenue settlement of the district, under which the rate of the government assessment on the land has been fixed for a series of years, and is not liable to be increased until the year 1872.\u00b9 Six or eight miles west of the Jumna, the country rises into a sort of table-land of rocky and quartzose formation, containing oxydes of iron\u00b2 and manganese, and bearing scanty and stunted jungle of acacias, of zizyphus, and Butea frondosa. This wild growth, dry and withered during the greater part of the year, shoots out with considerable luxuriance during the rainy season, and affords excellent browsing to goats, the principal stock of the natives. In a few places, gneiss and mica schist crop out.

The surface of the country is furrowed by numerous deep chasms and ravines, usually indicating the course of a torrent. The air in many of those ravines is, in autumn, deadly in the extreme, especially where the course of the torrent is marked by the growth of bamboos, which are invariably signs of the insalubrity of the situation. Yet each generally contains a hamlet of goatherds, now of necessity peacefully dwelling under the powerful but mild restraint of British rule, but until lately the pests of the surrounding districts, which they incessantly harassed with their incursions, sweeping away all moveable property, and seizing the inhabitants, with the view of extorting ransom. This rude people are of the Meo or Mewatti race, for the most part nominally professing Mahomedanism, but intermingling it with innumerable Hindoo superstitions. They are very fond of animal food, especially goat\u2019s flesh, and also of spirits, but are not addicted to opium. Jacquemont, who considers them the aborigines of this part of India, describes them as very black, with the lower extremities long, the features in general not strongly marked, but the nose approaching to the aquiline form, lips rather prominent, moderately-sized mouths, and oval eyes, the cast of their countenances altogether resembling that of the North-American Indians. Westward of the first rocky table-land, rising from the valley of the Jumna, and inclosed between it and the rocky range still farther west, is a valley or depressed sandy plain, stretching from north to south, about twenty miles in length and six or eight in breadth. In many places, the ground is so saturated with salt, that in the hot dry weather the surface is covered with an efflorescence of it; the soil is barren, or produces merely a scanty growth of mimosa, and a few other products, common under such circumstances. These tracts are so abruptly defined, that, in the immediate neighbourhood of them the soil will be found free from saline impregnation, and fertile, the wells also yielding fresh water. In many places, by digging to the depth of twenty or thirty feet, fresh water is found; but if the well be sunk ten\nGOORGAON.\n\nor twelve feet lower, salt springs are reached, the water of which is less saline than that of the sea, but more bitter, in consequence of containing a large quantity of sulphate of soda and muriate of magnesia. The salt water of each well being raised in a large leathern bucket, worked by rope and pulley, and set in motion by the labour of oxen and buffaloes, is conveyed through a small channel into a reservoir two or three feet deep, and lined with clay or mortar; and the moisture exhaling by the heat of the sun, the crystals are collected for sale. The quantity of salt produced in this way was formerly very considerable, but the article is now almost excluded from the market by the cheaper produce of the Sambhar Lake. In this sandy tract is a jhil or lake, about eight miles in length from north to south, and four in breadth. It is shallow, and its water, though without outlet, is fresh.* It is frequented by great numbers of water-fowl, especially pelicans.\n\nThe greater part of the district of Goorgaon passed to the British by the treaty of Serjee Anjengum, dated 30th December, 1803, by which Doulut Rao Scindia ceded\u2020 to the East-India Company his territories \"northward of those of the rajahs of Jeypore and Joudpore, and of the ranah of Gohud.\" Part of it, containing about a hundred and eighty square miles, was held in jaghire by the Kashmirian adventurer Zebal Nisaa, more generally known under the name of the Beegum Sumroo, and lapsed\u2021 to the British on her death in 1836. Another portion of about 200 square miles, termed the jaghire of Ferozepore, from its principal place, was held with Loharoo by Shamsuddin Khan, who took it by descent from Ahmad Buksh Khan, to whom it had been granted\u00a7 by the British government early in the present century, on account of services rendered against the Mahrattas. Shamsuddin Khan having, with the view of defeating some contemplated measures which would affect his jaghire, caused the murder of Mr. William Frazer, the British political agent at Delhi, was hanged\u00b6 at\n\n* It has been somewhat hastily taken for granted, that extensive pieces of water without outlet are always salt; but in addition to the fact instanced in the text, and vouched for by Jacquemont, Humboldt mentions an extensive fresh-water lake in South America without outlet, and Burnes states the water of the Sea of Aral to be drinkable.\nthat city, in October, 1835, and his jaghire forfeited. Loharoo was by the British government generously bestowed on the offender's half-brothers; but the territory of Ferozepore was embodied with the district of Goorgaon.\n\nThe principal places are Goorgaon, Ferozepore, Faridabad, Rewarree, Pulwul, and Hodul, which will be found noticed under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nGOORGAON, a town giving name to the British district so called, is situated near the western base of a range of hills of quartzose formation. Here was formerly a considerable military cantonment, the buildings erected for which are now occupied by the civil establishment. Goorgaon was formerly one of the principal places in the territory of the Begum Sumroo, which, lapsing on her death in 1836, was embodied with that of the British. The elevation of Goorgaon above the sea is 817 feet. Its mean temperature has been ascertained for various months as follows:\u2014May, 104\u00b0; June, 98\u00b0; July, 85\u00b0; August, 84\u00b0; September, 89\u00b0; October, 87\u00b0; November, 75\u00b0; December, 66\u00b0; January, 70\u00b0; February, 72\u00b0; March, 80\u00b0.

The place consists of a cluster of fortified hills,\u00b2 nearly surrounding a lower fort and native town; and outside the chain of fortified summits are the military cantonment and another pettah or town. The summits of the inclosing rocks are connected by a rampart, and the access to the town within is through two openings,\u00b3 secured by fortified gateways, one on the south-east, the other on the south-west; and there are besides two footpaths, affording a communication through sallyports. In the northern part of the circuit of inclosing rocks is an immense smooth rock, which, \"fortified\u2074 by gradations surmounted through fourteen gateways, overlooks and commands the whole of the other works, and forms a citadel which famine or treachery can alone reduce.\" On the summit\u2075 of this fortified hill are several tanks and reservoirs for water, and various buildings, in which are detained some state prisoners. About half-way down the northern side of this huge rock is a projecting shoulder of considerable extent, called Maha Gooty, on which are barracks, formerly occupied by part of a European regiment, but now fast falling to decay. External to this circular inclosure of rocky hills, and on the west side, are the present cantonments, with a contiguous pettah, consisting of one principal street, well drained, and having tolerably good houses. The cantonment, once of considerable size, is now in ruins, with the exception of two or three houses. There is a good parade-ground, on the north of which are a place of arms, store-rooms, and huts contiguous, for accommodating native infantry. On the west of the cantonment is a large tank, which is devoid of water during part of the year. This place, formerly the head-quarters of a brigade, including one European regiment, is now garrisoned by two companies of native\nGOP.\n\ninfantry, who enjoy excellent health, the air being in general salubrious.

It flows from a vast glacier, apparently of very remote formation. This is thus described by Weller:\u00b2\u2014\"The river comes out in a small but impetuous stream, at the foot of apparently a mass of dirt and gravel, some 300 feet high, shaped like a half-moon. This is in reality a mass of dark-coloured ice (bottle-green colour), extending westward to a great distance, and covered with stones and fragments of rock, which in fact form a succession of small hills. I went along this scene of desolation for a long space, but could not nearly reach the end. Here and there were circular and irregularly-shaped craters (as it were), from 50 to 500 feet diameter at top, and some of them 150 feet deep. The ice was frequently visible on the sides; and at the bottom was a dirty sea-green-coloured pool of water, apparently very deep. Into one of these craters I rolled down numerous large stones from off the edge, and in a few seconds huge masses of ice rose from below, seemingly detached by the agitation of the water.\" Webb\u00b3 found the stream at its exit\n\n* Gauri of Traill; Goree of Webb,\u2074 of the surveyor-general's map; Goreegunga of Garden;\u2075 Goree of Manson,\u2076 and of Weller;\u2077 Gaura, Gauri, or Gaurani, of Wilford,\u2078 who considers it identical with the Agoranis of Megasthenes.\n\n\u00b9 Statistical Acc. of Kumaon, 140.\n\u00b2 Field Book, No. iv.\n\u00b3 Ta. of Routes, 55.\n\u2074 Journ.

There is no passage up the gorge beyond the glacier. The elevation above the sea of the point of emergence from the glacier is, by barometer, 11,543 feet. The great accumulation of snow in the gorge results from the fall of avalanches, which Webb observed to cause in a few days an increase in the thickness of the stratum of upwards of forty feet. Hence, notwithstanding the extraordinary rapidity of the stream, resulting from a fall in some parts of its bed of 800 feet per mile, the river is overlaid with deep snow for a considerable distance below its source. It first takes a southeasterly direction for four miles, to its confluence with the Ghunka, which, rising on the southern declivity of the Unta Dhura Pass, has a course nearly south, and in lat. 30\u00b0 24', long. 80\u00b0 12', joins the Gori on the left side of the latter. Though the Ghunka has a greater length of course by about twelve or fourteen miles, and a greater volume of water than the Gori, the latter gives its name to the united stream. For some miles below the confluence, the stream varies in width from twelve to twenty yards, and runs with such extraordinary violence and rapidity, as in many places to resemble a cascade tumbling down a rugged face of rocks; in others it is hid below a continuous mass of ice and snow. In forty miles, the declivity of the waterway is 6,599 feet, or upwards of 160 in a mile. It receives on the right and left many torrents, none very considerable; and, continuing its course in a southerly direction, so as totally to run about sixty miles, falls into the Kalee on the right side. Webb, who crossed it at this place by a sangha or spar bridge, found it unfordable, 102 feet wide, very violent and rapid. A short distance lower down, it is, however, fordable in three and a half feet water. The confluence is 1,972 feet above the sea.

It is bounded on the north by the territory of Nepaul; on the east and south-east by the district Sarun; on the south by the British district of Azimgurh; on the southwest and west by the territory of Oude. It lies between lat. $26^\\circ 7'$\u2014$27^\\circ 30'$, long. $82^\\circ 12'$\u2014$84^\\circ 30'$, and includes an area of 7,346 square miles.\\(^2*\\) The district is in general remarkably\\(^3\u2020\\) level, but at a few spots in the east and south-east, there are some ridges of slight elevation, seldom exceeding sixty feet in perpendicular height above the plain, with a breadth of from 100 to 300 yards. They consist of a light soil, well suited for the growth of trees, but are not cultivable, the steepness of their slopes precluding irrigation. The more southern are visible to those passing up and down the Ganges.\\(^4\\) Their crest has an uneven outline, and they are rendered the more remarkable by the fact that no similar elevations are visible in navigating the river from the vicinity of the Himalayas. From calculations founded on the slope of river-beds, the average\n\n* The extent of this district was formerly larger. In 1832 a portion of it, and a portion detached from Ghazepore, were formed into a separate collectorate, called Azimgurh.\n\n\u2020 Buchanan mentions an exception to the generally level character of the country,\u2014the mountain of Maddar, in the north of the district; but that tract was ceded to the Goorkahs in 1816.\nGORUCKPORE.\n\nelevation of the central part of the district of Goruckpore above the sea is estimated at about 340 feet.* The surface slopes with a general and very gentle declivity from north-west to south-east, as is indicated by the courses of the Ghaghra, Raptee, Gunduck, and divers other streams. The general descent probably does not on an average exceed eight inches per mile; and in consequence of the comparative flatness, many parts are laid under water during the rainy season. From many hollows the abundant rains never entirely evaporate, and hence the country abounds in jhils or shallow lakes. \"In the rainy season these are of great extent and pretty deep, but even then they are in many parts hid by reeds, some aquatic trees, and many aquatic herbs. As the long dry season advances, their size contracts greatly, and, except in a few parts, they become very shallow, and in many dry; while every day they are more and more obscured by vegetation.\"\n\n\"They differ much,\" adds Buchanan, \"from bogs or marshes, in having nothing offensive or putrid on their sides or bottoms, which, notwithstanding the immense quantity of vegetables and animals that they contain, consist of fine clay, which, immediately on being exposed to the air, becomes firm; nor does it even emit any offensive vapour. The vicinity of these pieces of water is therefore perfectly healthy.\" The most important are the Moti Jhil (Pearl of Lakes) or jhil of Bakhira, twelve miles west of the town of Goruckpore; in the dry season seven miles long and three broad; the Ramgarhtal, close to the east of the same town, six long and three broad; and Bherital, in the south-east of the district, and near the left bank of the Ghaghra.\n\nThe climate of Goruckpore is sultry in the southern parts, but is considered as healthy as any in India of the same average temperature. In the north, or towards the base of the Himalaya, the heat is not so great, but the air is less salubrious; fever, intermittents, and other complaints generated by malaria, being much more common. The easterly and westerly winds are the more prevalent; and the change to the opposite directions generally takes place after a short intervening calm, without veering through the intermediate points.\n\n* Brande's Journal, vol. ii. first series, p. 242. Colebrooke estimates the elevation above the sea at 400 feet; but this very probably errs in excess.\n\n\u2020 As. Res. xii. 268.\nGORUCKPORE.\n\nThe west winds prevail from the middle of February to the middle of June, when they are succeeded by those from the east. These continue until the middle of October, and during the remainder of the year the east and west winds blow for nearly equal periods, the north and south winds blowing only occasionally. In the immediate vicinity of the mountains, a current of air rushing down each considerable gorge, produces nearly every forenoon a wind from north to south. The westerly winds are not attended by that searing and pernicious sultriness which causes them in tracts lying more to the westward and south-westward to be emphatically denominated \"the hot winds.\" In winter, indeed, they are accompanied by such a degree of cold as produces thin ice. The periodical rains continue from the middle of June to the middle of October: they are less liable to failure than in places farther south or west, and are more abundant and certain in proportion to proximity to the mountains.\n\nGroves and jungles abounding in Goruckpore, there is ample cover for wild animals. Tigers infest many parts, but less than formerly, in consequence of the havoc made amongst them by the keenness of British sportsmen. A sentinel was once carried\\(^1\\) off by a tiger from the midst of the large town of Goruckpore, and in 1769, a famine having destroyed most of the herbivorous animals, the tigers became desperate from hunger, and, entering the town of Bhewopar, destroyed about 400 of the inhabitants; the remainder of whom seeking safety in flight, the place was for some time desolate. So lately as 1807, it was stated that about seven or eight human beings, and between 200 and 300 head of cattle, annually fell a prey to tigers. They are most dangerous during the periodical rains, when driven from the reedy jungles, in which at other seasons they harbour. The natives enumerate four species of the large feline tribes:\u20141. The Nongiyachor or royal tiger; 2. the Babbra, which is white, has very long hair about the head, and exceeds the former in size; 3. the Cheeta or hunting leopard; 4. the Tenduya, a small spotted feline creature, living in trees. The black Indian bear is common, as is the wolf; jackals are numerous, and many being seized with hydrophobia, the destruction of life from this cause is not uncommon. Foxes are rare, and the existence of hyenas in the district\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Buchanan, ii. 500.\nGORUCKPORE.\n\nappears doubtful. Wild elephants are very destructive, and have been often seen within a mile or two of the large town of Goruckpore. They do much injury to the grain, and sometimes kill persons in the less-frequented parts. The rhinoceros is not so common as the elephant;* but wild buffaloes are frequently seen in herds of several hundreds. Wild swine, deer, and antelopes are abundant. Monkeys are common in the woods, and porcupines are met with in all parts. The goshawk or baz is tamed for falconry. The parrot, paroquet, peafowl, bustard, partridge, quail, lovebird, jackdaw, and lark, abound. The number and variety of waterfowl is astonishing; and they are used as food to a great extent. Among them are cranes, ducks, coots, and grebes. Porpoises are found in the large rivers, and tortoises in both running and standing water. The ghariyar or Gangetic crocodile, and the nak or alligator, are very numerous and dangerous, penetrating into every stream and piece of water during the rains. Serpents exist in great numbers; and it is reported that between 200 and 300 persons die every year of their bites. Scorpions swarm in many places, but their bite is never fatal. Fish are abundant, but usually small, the ravages of the crocodiles preventing any considerable supply of those of large size. According to Buchanan,\u00b2 1,625 families, employing 395 small boats, are engaged in fishing. Honey is produced in considerable quantities, and the lac insect abounds; but little care is taken to collect its produce.\n\nBuchanan estimates the extent of woodland at 1,450\u00b3 square miles. The trees comprise the sal (Shorea robusta), the pipal (Ficus religiosa), the harra, prized both for its fruit and timber, mahua (Bassia latifolia), the esculent flowers of which yield a spirit in much request; various species of mimosa, tamarind, and many others. The Bauhinia scandens, a climbing shrub, attains the size of a man's waist in girth, is sometimes trained across a stream or a chasm, thus forming a swinging bridge that lasts for years. Bamboos are used intermixed with other plants, to form fences round plantations. Of fruit-trees, the mango is everywhere cultivated, though its produce is of poor quality; there are also species of citrons,\n\n* The Terai, or marshy forest stretching along the southern base of the Sub-Himalaya, is probably the principal habitat of the rhinoceros.\n\nUt supra, 512.\nGORUCKPORE.\n\npeach, and pomegranate: long pepper grows spontaneously. The lands liable to inundation are cultivated with rice, which is the staple crop of most parts of this district, though in some wheat\\(^4\\) is more extensively grown. A few years since, inquiries were made by the local government as to the probability of the latter becoming a profitable article of export to the United Kingdom, but the results were not such as to afford encouragement to the trial of the experiment.\\(^5\\) Other crops are barley, millet, maize, the opium poppy, arhar (Cytisus cajanus), gram (Cicer arietinum), peas, and various other kinds of pulse; some species of amaranthus, mustard, and other oil-plants; ginger, turmeric, and betel. Cotton\\(^6\\) is grown, though not to a sufficient* extent for the home demand. In the experimental farms of the government, native sorts were found to succeed well, but the American kinds failed. Indigo is cultivated by grantees\\(^7\\) of the East-India Company. Tobacco is extensively grown, principally for home consumption. The sugarcane is well\\(^8\\) suited to the soil and climate, though more remote from the equator than the generality of tracts in which sugar is successfully cultivated. The attention of British capitalists has latterly been directed to the planting of mulberry-trees.\\(^9\\)\n\nThe domestic animals of Goruckpore are camels, horses, asses, kine,\\(\\dagger\\) sheep, goats, and swine.\n\nThe population being very indigent, and in a low state of civilization, the manufactures are few and simple, being nearly restricted to coarse cottons,\\(\\ddagger\\) woollens, tanning, dyeing, rude workings in metals, sugar-boiling, and extraction of soda and nitre from soils impregnated with those substances. The exports are represented\\(^1\\) to be grain, pulse, oil-seeds, oil, sugar, molasses, ginger, turmeric, tobacco, lac, honey, wax, indigo, cotton cloth, nitre, ghee or clarified butter, elephants, kine,\n\n* A proprietor and cultivator to great extent states\\(^1\\) that the cotton of Goruckpore is not fit to be sent down to Calcutta, and is only adapted for local consumption.\n\n\u2020 Buchanan gives the numbers of the live stock in great detail; but the statements, if liable to no other objection, are now obsolete.\n\n\u2021 A proprietor and cultivator (Mr. Sym), who gave evidence before a select committee of the House of Commons on East-India produce, believed\\(^1\\) that most of the cloth worn by ryots was woven in the villages, and that as much as was made was consumed; but he disclaimed any accurate knowledge on the subject.\nGORUCKPORE.\n\nbuffaloes, goats, fish, and timber. The imports are said to consist of cotton wool, thread, and cloth, chintzes, silks, broadcloths, blankets of wool and cotton,* hardware, and some other articles of less importance.\n\nThe principal routes are\u20141. from west to east,\u00b2 from Fyzabad, through the town of Goruckpore, to Betiya; 2. from southeast to north-west, from Dinapoor\u00b3 to the town of Goruckpore, and thence continued in the same direction to Sekhora, in Oude; 3. in a direction nearly from north\u2074 to south, from the town of Goruckpore to Azimgurh; 4. in a direction nearly from north to south, from the town\u2075 of Goruckpore to Ghazeepore; 5. from north-east to south-west,\u2076 from the town of Goruckpore to Sultanpoor, in Oude. Great improvements, calculated to develop the resources of the country, have been effected in the district within the last few years, by the Road Fund Committee, resulting in an increase of the government rental, the amount of which was subsequently fixed for a series of years, and is not liable to a further increase until 1859.\u2077 A plan adopted by the local government for bringing the waste lands into cultivation, which first came under the notice of the home authorities in 1836, did not, when the details came to be understood, secure their approbation. Vast grants of waste land at a progressive rental, increasing from the fourth to the twenty-fifth year, were made to various individuals, four-fifths of whom were Europeans, and the remainder Anglo-Indians. These grants were stated to have amounted to nearly 418,000 British statute acres, or 653 square miles; and it appeared that three individuals were concerned, either directly or indirectly, in no less than 208,480 acres, or 345 square miles; an area exceeding that of the county of Middlesex. These enormous allotments were judged by the home authorities to have been made without due regard either to the circumstances of the country transferred, or to the means possessed by the\n\n* From former notes, it will be seen that the cotton of Goruckpore is unfit for the Calcutta market, but that it was believed that the cloth used by the villagers was mostly of home fabrication. Notwithstanding the badness of the quality, cotton cloth is mentioned as an article of export; but some descriptions of cotton manufactured goods appear also to be imported.

For the guidance of the local government in future, certain rules were enjoined, and others recommended, for the purpose of avoiding on future occasions the errors committed in regard to these grants. Among the objects proposed by these rules, were the prohibition of any grant of land without previous survey; the prohibition of any grant to a European, unless he engaged to reside on the land himself, and to bring it into cultivation within a specified period; the prohibition of sale or transfer until the land had been brought into cultivation; the limitation of the extent of grants made under general conditions, and the annexation of special conditions to additional grants; the resort to public competition, by inviting tenders for the purchase of waste land; the admission of natives to a share in the distribution; the preservation of all ancient rights; the maintenance of roads and drains, and the due apportionment of water for irrigation. Some of these points were enforced in orders issued in 1836, and final and peremptory orders on the subject were sent out in 1842.\n\nThe population, according to a census taken in 1848, amounts to 2,376,533. Of these, 1,779,678 are returned as Hindoos engaged in agriculture; 331,247 Hindoos employed in other occupations; 198,765 Mahomedans and others, not being Hindoos, agricultural; 66,843 non-agricultural. It will thus be seen that the great majority of the inhabitants of Goruckpore are Hindoos. The Mahomedans of course form the next largest number. There are, it is said, a few Sikhs; and a small number of the rich merchants and tradesmen profess the doctrine of the Jains. Men of all classes and descriptions formerly went armed for the purpose either of outrage or defence; but since the country passed into the hands of the British government, all the strongholds of freebooters have been demolished, and no open resistance is now shown to the ruling authority.\n\nThe tract constituting this district was formerly part of the possessions of Oude, and was comprised within the transfer of territory made under the treaty of the 10th November, 1801, by the nawaub vizier, to the East-India Company, in communication of their claims for subsidy and other charges.\nGORUCKPORE.\n\nThe district contains three towns having more than 5,000 inhabitants but less than 10,000, and two (Goruckpore and Jungul Puowna) having more than 10,000. Some notice of them will be found in the proper places under the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nGORUCKPORE.\u2014The principal place of the British district of the same name, within the limits of the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces. It is situate on the left bank of the Raptee, which is here a fine navigable river, with a channel about 200 yards wide, at all seasons containing deep water, and consequently passable only by ferry, there being no bridge. \"Only a corner of the town is adjacent to the bank, the extent of high ground being there small, and widening farther back from the river. The situation, however, is good and healthy, and would be more agreeable were the forests and plantations cleared away, as they exclude ventilation, occasion many mosquitoes, and harbour great numbers of monkeys, which are exceedingly troublesome. But the natives object strongly to any such measure.\" This favourable report of the place must, however, be received with some qualification, as there is much marsh in the vicinity of the town, and in the rainy season the whole country southwards for six miles, as far as the river Ami, is often laid under water. Tieffenthaler estimates its circuit at three miles, but mentions that the natives reported it to be seven. A few of the houses are of brick, and tiled; the larger portion of the remainder have mud\n\n* From Gorukh, the proper name of a Hindu teacher, and Pur, \"town.\" Buchanan says the name \"is no doubt derived from the personage named Gorakhnath in the vulgar language, and Gorakshanath in the Sanskrit, who is said to have resided some time at the place, performing penance. The fables which his followers relate concerning this person, are so extravagant, from their supposing that he is the only true God, who has always existed, that nothing satisfactory can be derived from this source concerning the duration of the town of Goruckpoor.\" Buchanan appears to deem this personage purely imaginary. It is said, however, that a person named Gorakh flourished in the beginning of the fifteenth century; that he was a man of some acquirements, and has left specimens of his scholarship in two Sanskrit compositions. According to the authorities of the sect, \"Gorakh is but one of nine eminent teachers or naths.\" Tieffenthaler also mentions Gorenath, \"a hermit held in very great esteem among the heathen.\"\n\n\u2020 In the time of Tieffenthaler, a century ago, it was crossed by a bridge of boats 100 paces in length.\nGORUCKPORE.\n\nwalls, but are tiled; but a small number are mere hovels of hurdle, and thatched. \"When new,\" like others in this district, the tiled roofs are uncommonly neat, but they are very soon spoiled by the monkeys, who, from their insatiable curiosity and restless mischief, turn over the tiles, and render the roofs the most unseemly and useless in the world.\" There are two mosques; one completely ruinous; the other, which is in better preservation, and is still frequented, is built of brick, in a remarkably heavy, tasteless style. Both buildings are mentioned by Tieffenthaler, who describes the former as ancient a century ago. The Imam-barah, built by Shoojeh-oo-Dowlah, nawaub of Oude, is handsome and spacious, and is kept in excellent repair by a person who has a large endowment. It would have a striking and fine effect, were it not surrounded by a chaos of filth and misery. The fort bears the name of Basantpoor, and is situate close to the left bank of the Raptee. The ground-plan given by Tieffenthaler is a regular square, with a bastion at each corner, and two intermediate, at regular intervals on each face; and consequently twelve altogether. When the English took possession, in 1802, the fortifications had become ruinous, and part of the fort was then demolished, and some rooms built in the European style. Buchanan adds\u2014\"But still it is a very sorry place, although it serves the collector as an office and treasury. Round the town the magistrates have made some good roads, and the houses of Europeans are scattered on the east, south, and west sides of the town, especially on the last, where the military cantonments and jail are situated. I have seen no station where the houses of the Europeans have so poor an appearance, or where the grounds about them are so destitute of ornament.\" The cantonment is at present on the east side of the town, on the highest ground that could be appropriated for the purpose; and from the sandiness of the soil, water seldom lodges on it for more than a day or two. But this high ground immediately rises from the Ramgartal, a jhil or shallow lake situate on its south-east side, which is six miles long and three broad, and from the channels by which this\n\n* According to Richardson, \"a place illuminated at the festival of Mohurrum, where the shrines of the imams Hasan and Husseyn are visited with great veneration.\"\n\n390\nGORUCKPORE.\n\nexpanses of stagnant water receives the drainage of a great jungle lying on the north, and stretching eastward of the cantonment. When this jhil and the river Raptee rise to a certain height, a communication is formed between them, and the level of the stagnant water is regulated by that of the river. If, however, the communication be long interrupted during hot weather, the whole surface of the jhil becomes a mass of decayed vegetable matter. The cantonment affords accommodation for a detail of native artillery, a detachment of light cavalry, and a regiment of native infantry. The civil establishment consists of the usual European officers and native functionaries. The population of the town of Goruckpore, according to a census taken in 1848, amounted to 45,265.\n\nA short distance from the town is the sthan or place of Goracknath,* near which is a tank intended for ritual ablutions, and said to have been miraculously formed.\n\nThis town is mentioned in the Ayeen Akbery as having a brick fort.

Prinsep, from barometrical observation, estimates the elevation of Benares above the sea at 270 feet. Revelgunge is 165 miles lower down the Ganges than Benares, and, assuming with Prinsep the slope of the water-line of the Ganges in that part of its course to be five inches per mile, the elevation of Revelgunge may be estimated at 270\u201469 feet, or, in round numbers, at 200 feet, and that of the mouth of the Ghaghra, ten miles nearer Benares, at 204 feet. Now, from the mouth of the Ghaghra to Goruckpore, by the continuous course of part of that river and of the Raptee, is about 130 miles; and allowing a foot per mile for the slope of the water-line, which is perhaps as much as is admissible for streams thoroughly navigable either way, it will be found that the elevation of Goruckpore cannot exceed 204 + 130 = 334 feet; and consequently, the estimate made by Colebrooke must be regarded as erring in excess.\nFuttehgurh, and eight miles N.E. of the latter.

Water in this district is scarcely to be had except during rains, and even then in small pools barely capable of supplying 100 men. The fort of Gottarao is built of brick, and forms a square of about 200 yards. The wall is from twenty to twenty-five feet high, and a keep in the interior is about ten feet higher. On the east and the greater part of the north side is an outer wall of about ten feet high. There are about a dozen round bastions in various parts of the walls.

The road eastward, or towards the cantonment of Muttra, is generally indifferent, and heavy in parts; westward, towards Deeg, it is good. This vicinity is in the Hindoo mythological legends marked by the fabled miracles and exploits of the divinity Krishna, who at the age of eight years \"took\"\\(^4\\) up Mount Goovurdhunu in his arms, and held it as an umbrella over the heads of the villagers and their cattle, during a dreadful storm, with which the angry king of heaven was overwhelming\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) E.I.C.

During a great drought, when the people were worshipping Indra, the god of the heavens, Krishna recommended them to propitiate the deity of the mountain, which they accordingly did. Krishna then assuming the form of a god, sat on its top, from whence he stretched out his hand and devoured the food offered; but the weight of his body was such, that the mountain bent under it; in which shape it still continues. In the months of August and October, great multitudes of his votaries, having illuminated the mountain, ascend to its summit, and then perform certain solemnities.\"\n\n\u2020 Sleeman recounts the legend respecting those hills:\u2014\"This range of hills is believed by Hindoos to be part of a fragment of the Himalah Mountains, which Hunnooman, the monkey general of Ram, the sixth incarnation of Vishnu, was taking down to aid his master in the formation of his bridge from the continent to the island of Ceylon, when engaged in the war with the demon king of that island, for the recovery of his wife Seeta. He made a false step by some accident, in passing Goverdhun, and this small bit of his load fell off. The rocks begged to be either taken on the god Ram, or back to their old place; but Hunnooman was hard pressed for time, and told them not to be uneasy, as they would have a comfortable resting-place, and be worshipped by millions in future ages; thus, according to popular belief, foretelling that it would become the residence of a future incarnation, and the scene of Krishna's miracles. The range was then about twenty miles long, ten having since disappeared under the ground. It was of full length during Krishna's days, and on one occasion he took up the whole upon his little finger, to defend his favourite town and its milkmaids from the wrath of Judar, who got angry with the people, and poured down upon them a shower of burning ashes.\"\n\n\"It was night when Hunnooman passed this place, and the lamps were seen burning in a hundred towns upon the mountain he had upon his back.\"\n\nSleeman states that it was the birth-place of Krishna, but Shakespear\nrise abruptly. The population is at present scanty, consisting in a great measure of Brahmins, supported on the endowments annexed to the tombs of the Jat rajahs of Bhurtpore and of Deeg, whose bodies are burned and their ashes inhumated at this town. The tomb of Suraj Mul, the eminent Jat ruler of Bhurtpore, is on the north-eastern extremity of the rock ridge, about two miles from the town, and is a handsome building, tastefully designed, and elaborately executed in fine white sandstone, little inferior to marble. Connected with this principal building are various subordinate temples, and the whole group extending along one side of a fine tank, full of clear water, and on the other side overlooking a large and beautiful garden. In the middle of the town is the handsome tomb of Ranjit Singh, the rajah who successfully defended Bhurtpoor against British assaults in 1805. On each side of the tomb is a tank, one being full; the other, though deeper, is dry, the contents having been drunk off by Krishna, when heated and thirsty, after dancing with his milkmaids; and never since has it had any water.\n\nLat. 27\u00b0 30', long. 77\u00b0 32'.\n\nGOVINDAPOORAM.\u2014A town in the British district of Rajahmundry, presidency of Madras, 82 miles S.W. of Vizagapatam.

The Markunda and Sursooty, farther east, flow down the same valley, which, in time of inundation, is deluged with water, forming a close network of streams, and sometimes causing the three rivers to coalesce into one great stream. In the season when lowest, it becomes a \"small thread of water.\"$^3$ Jacquemont,$^4$ who crossed it at that time, describes the channel as narrow, but very deep, being, in fact, a ravine scooped by the torrent out of the alluvial soil. The water was then about two feet deep, but appearances indicated that in time of inundation it might be eight or nine. Having received the Sursooty, and some streams of less importance, it, after a course of about 140 miles, generally in a south-west direction, passes into the British district of Hurreeanah, and subsequently into that of Butteeanah; its course through these two provinces measuring about 110 miles. It then crosses the Beekaneer frontier, close to which, near Badhopal, and twenty-two miles south-east of Bhatnir, in lat. $29^\\circ 24'$, long. $74^\\circ 14'$, it is joined by a water-course, the continuation of the celebrated canal of Feroz Shah.$^5$\n\nHereabouts it becomes totally exhausted by evaporation, absorption, and diversion for the purposes of irrigation, but formerly reached the Sutlej, about twenty miles north-east of the town of Bahawulpooor, by a channel which, though now devoid of water, can be traced to that extent.

This fort, formerly looked upon as of great importance, has of late years been much disregarded, and the pass is scarcely frequented, those farther north being preferred, as more convenient* for the lines of communication with Madras and Tanjore. The valley through which the pass lies, is the great gorge down the bottom of which flows the Moyaar, a large torrent, and the sides of which are formed towards the south-west by the precipitous brow of the Neilgherries, having an elevation of from 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the torrent, and towards the north-east by the steep declivities of the mountains rising towards Mysore. The fort of Gujelhatti, situate on the left bank of the torrent Moyaar, was, in 1768, taken from Hyder Ali by a British force commanded by Colonel Wood, but was retaken in the same year. It is distant from Seringapatam, S.E., 63 miles; Coimbatoor, N., 38 miles; Madras, S.W., 240.

It was invested by Maha Singh, who sickened and died in the course of the siege. It subsequently fell into the hands of his more fortunate son, Runjeet Singh, early in the course of his career. Near this place, on the 21st February, 1849, a battle was fought between a British force, under the command of Lord Gough, and a Seikh army, under two chieftains, described as Sirdar Chuttur Singh and Rajah Shere Singh, combined with some troops belonging to the ruler of Cabool, the entire number being estimated at 60,000. This apparently overwhelming force was vigorously attacked by the British, greatly inferior in point of numbers, and driven in succession from point to point, until, utterly defeated, the enemy took to disorderly flight, abandoning their camp, artillery, baggage, and magazines.

Here is a large square fort with mud walls, surrounded by a ditch. It was the original residence of the family of Runjeet Singh, whose grandfather, born at this place, was a common soldier. The ashes of Runjeet Singh's father and mother are deposited here in tombs of plain appearance. It a few years ago was the residence of the celebrated Hari Singh, the most dauntless of all the Sikh chieftains. The interior of the fort is very highly decorated, and the garden is described by Baron Von H\u00fcgel as one of the finest he saw in India. It abounds in fine fruit-trees, especially orange-trees, covered with fruit superior to that of China. The fragrance from the superb collection of trees, shrubs, and flowers, is described as almost overpowering. Numerous ornamental buildings, appropriately embellished, and a fountain always playing, so as to send forth a broad sheet of limpid water, complete the attractions of the scene.

The position of its remotest source has probably not yet been indubitably ascertained. Buchanan says: \"This is a grand river, the most remote source of which, named Damodarkund, is beyond the Snowy Mountains, in the territories of a chief of Bhotan or Thibet, named the Mastang Raja, and now tributary to Gorkha.\" The position of the source thus assigned is lat. 29\u00b0 40', long. 83\u00b0 14'. Colebrooke, however, expresses a wish \"that some traveller may be induced to visit the Himalaya in that quarter, and explore the great Gandhaki river to its source at the foot of Dhawalagiri;\" a position laid down from trigonometrical operations in lat. 29\u00b0 11', long. 82\u00b0 59', or about half a degree farther south. After a long and winding course through the immense chasms of the Himalaya and the hills of inferior height south of them, and during which it receives numerous tributary streams, it is joined, at Nayakot, in lat. 27\u00b0 31', long. 84\u00b0 5', by the Trisoolgunga,\u2020\n\n* Gainda, in Sanscrit, means \"rhinoceros;\" and Ritter supposes that hence is the name of the river, but gives no reasons in support of his opinion. Hamilton says, \"In northern Hindostan, the term Gunduck is a general appellation for river.\" He quotes Rennell; but though search has been made, no mention of this river has been discovered in Rennell; and the passage quoted by Hamilton, is erroneously given from Wilford, who observes, \"The Gandaci or Gandacavati is called Gandac in the spoken dialects, and is the Condochates of Megasthenes;\" and adds, \"The river Gandaca is so called, because it proceeds from a mountain of that name. The people of Naypala call it Cundaci, because it proceeds from the Cunda-Stala, or the two cavities or depressions of the temples of Vishnu, in the shape of a mountain. It is also called Salagrama, because of the stone of that name found in its bed. Another name for it is Narayani, because Vishnu or Narayana abides in its waters, in the shape of the above stone.\" Buchanan observes, that \"all the upper part of the river is usually named Narayani, after the Supreme Being, or Salagrami, after stones which the Hindoos worship, and which are found in its channel;\" and adds, that the name Gandak is given to it in the plains; \"nor is it ever used among the mountaineers, except by such as are acquainted with the continuity of the stream, and adapt their conversation to the understanding of the people in the low country.\"\n\n\u2020 The Buri Gandak of Walker's map: Trisulgunga, from Trisul, \"a trident or three-pointed spear,\" the emblem of Siva, and Ganga, \"river;\" and no doubt the name is connected with some legend respecting that mythological personage.\nGUNDUCK.\n\nwhich comes from the higher parts of the Himalaya north of Kathmandoo, and is considered by Buchanan to have the greater volume of water, though its course is the shorter of the two.* From this point downwards it is navigable* for canoes; and at Bhelaunji, ten miles below the confluence last named, becomes so for boats of considerable burthen. The length of course from its remotest source down to this point will be 200 miles. A short distance below this, it sweeps round the base of Maddar Mountain, in the Sub-Himalayan range. Buchanan describes the scenery there, as not to be surpassed. \"The utmost magnificence, however, of rude nature that I have ever seen, is the view from the Gandaki, in passing up that river by the foot of Maddar. The river is larger, I think, than the Thames at Chelsea, and much finer, being perfectly clear. Its banks are partly abrupt rocks, partly levels covered with very stately forests, while every turn opens a new view of the snowy peaks seen over an endless variety of dark, shaggy mountains, which in most countries would be considered as stupendous.\" He adds, that upon reaching the plains, it appears in the dry season to have quite as much water as the Ganges after the junction of the Jumna at Allahabad. In consequence of the height of the banks, the breadth does not much increase in the rainy season, but the current becomes so rapid as to give rise to danger. In the dry season the water is ten or twelve feet deep, and the current, although equable, is very strong, approaching near, but not reaching that degree of rapidity which occasions a rippling noise; the water is perfectly clear, and the bottom consists chiefly of large water-worn pebbles. Though navigable continuously through its whole course downwards from Bhelaunji, there are in the part of its channel nearer that place many rapids and passes, where, the course being obstructed by\n\n* Wilford relates a legend respecting the origin of those two headwaters of the Gunduck. Vishnu dreading the power of the planet Saturn, had recourse to Maya or illusion, and assumed the form of a rocky mountain, but still did not deceive his enemy, who, in the shape of a worm, pierced and gnawed every part of this illusive body. Vishnu was thus tormented for one revolution of Saturn, and through pain and vexation, sweated most profusely, especially about the temples, from each of which issued a stream,\u2014the Crishna or Black, and the Sweta or White Gunduk; the one to the east, the other to the west.\nGUNDUCK.\n\nrocks, navigation becomes difficult and dangerous. Near Bhelaunji it first touches the British territory, which for fifteen miles it divides from Nepaul; thence taking a south-easterly direction, forms for twenty miles the boundary between the districts of Goruckpore and Sarun; then for forty miles flows through Sarun, and again for seventeen miles forms the boundary between the two before-mentioned districts, when it again enters Sarun, through which it holds a circuitous course, but generally in a south-easterly direction, for forty-five miles, to lat. 26\u00b0 18', long. 84\u00b0 58', where it touches on the British district of Tirhoot, and continuing its circuitous but generally south-easterly course for sixty miles, during which it forms the boundary between the districts of Sarun and Tirhoot, it falls into the Ganges on the left side, in lat. 25\u00b0 39', long. 85\u00b0 16', at the town of Hajeeapore, situate on the left bank, and opposite the city of Patna. According to the view of Buchanan, its length of course should be estimated at 407 miles. At its confluence with the Ganges, the latter is a wide expanse of water, probably not less than four miles in breadth, from Hajeeapore on the north bank to Patna on the south, and having two large shifting banks or islands, which much perplex the navigation. It does not appear that the Gunduck, after leaving the mountains, receives any feeder of importance; but during the rainy season it inosculates right and left with many watercourses then traversing that alluvial country. Buchanan, in his report, drawn up above forty years ago, adverts to the great changes which the river-channel had undergone in the thirty years which had then elapsed since Rennell laid down the survey of that part of the Ganges. \"The island, when Major Rennell made his survey, which was opposite to the cantonment of Danapur, seems to have been carried away; and that which was then situate east from it, in the middle of the river, now, in a great measure, adheres to the southern bank. In the rainy season, a passage still continues open; but in the fair season, its upper end becomes perfectly dry, and boats can no longer reach the Company's cloth-factory, situated on the former bank of the river. This island is now about six miles long, and where largest, about\n\n* Heber styles it \"the Gunduck from Nepaul.\"\n\u2020 Hamilton estimates its length of course at 450 miles.\n\n7 Heber, Jours. through India, l. 231.\n8 Rennell, Bengal Atlas, No. 14.\n9 Bacon, First Impressions, l. 296.\n1 Eastern India, l. 7.\n1 Gazetteer, l. 614.\nGUNDUCK CHOTA.\n\none broad. The main channel, passing round the north side of the above-mentioned island, does not now receive the Gandaki at Hajipur; a long, wide, and cultivated tongue of land projects from the west side of the Gandaki, and passing east about six miles from Hajipur, separates the stream of the Gandaki from the Ganges; but as in the rainy season a small channel separates this tongue from the northern shore, the union of the two rivers is still supposed to take place where it did formerly, and on the full moon of Kartik (seventh lunar month), the holy spot is frequented by immense multitudes; and at Hariharchhatra, on the west bank of the Gandaki, opposite to Hajipur, there is then held a very great fair, especially for horses.\" In Tassin's great map of Bengal and Behar (Calcutta, 1841), the tongue of land mentioned above is represented as severed from the northern bank by the main stream of the Ganges restored to its former channel. In lat. 27\u00b0 9', long. 84\u00b0 9', 160 miles above its mouth, the Gunduck is crossed, at the village of Butsura, by the route from Goruckpore to Mullye, the passage being made by ferry. The Gunduck is mentioned by Baber as a line of defence taken up by the Bengalees to resist his invasion.\n\nGUNDUCK CHOTA,* or LESSER GUNDUCK,\u2020 so called in distinction from the greater Gunduck, flowing a little farther to the east. It is called Burha\u2020 Gunduck, or Old Gunduck, from a notion of the natives that it at one time formed part of the course of the Great Gunduck, though, as Buchanan\u2021 observes, it is impossible, in consequence of intervening mountains, that there could have been any communication between the streams. The Chota Gunduck rises from a fine perennial fountain at the base of a mountain,- near the northern boundary of the district of Goruckpore, and about lat. 27\u00b0 20', long. 83\u00b0 50'. It holds a sinuous course, but generally in a southerly direction, and, fifty-two miles\u2021 from its source, according to Buchanan,\u00a7 is \"little sunk below the surface, and towards the end of February (dry season)\n\n* Chota, \"little.\"\n\u2020 Burha, \"old.\"\n\u2021 These distances from the river's source do not correspond with the statements of Buchanan; the reason being, that they are ascertained by measurement along the course of the river, while those of Buchanan are measured directly across the country.\ncontained a pretty clear stream, about forty feet wide, and more than knee-deep;\" and fifty-six miles lower down, or 108 from its source, \"the Lesser Gunduck in some parts is a channel 100 yards wide, which in March contains a clear, gentle stream, thirty yards wide and two feet deep, running on pure sand; in other parts it is much narrower, the channel being clay; and there the water is deep, but even in November (close of the rainy season) nearly stagnant, and rather dirty.\" At about 150 miles from its source, and seventeen from its mouth, according to the same author, \"this river may be 150 or 200 yards wide. At all seasons it may be navigated by canoes, although it has little current and is full of weeds; and in the rainy season boats of 1,000 maunds (thirty-six tons) burden could frequent it.\" It receives numerous small streams right and left, and communicates by lateral channels with several of the watercourses which abound in this level and alluvial tract, and, having flowed altogether about 170 miles, falls into the Gogra on the left side, in lat. 26\u00b0 1', long. 84\u00b0 12'.\n\nGUNDUK (THE LITTLE).\u2014A river rising on the northern boundary of the British district of Sarun, presidency of Bengal, near Fort Soomeysur, in lat. 27\u00b0 22', long. 84\u00b0 22'. Flowing in a south-easterly direction for about 120 miles, it, in lat. 26\u00b0 16', long. 85\u00b0 18', leaves the district of Sarun and enters that of Tirhoot, which it traverses in the same direction for about seventy miles, to its junction with the Bagmuttee, in lat. 25\u00b0 45', long. 86\u00b0 2'.\n\nGUNGA.\u2014A considerable watercourse of the Ganges, leaving that river in lat. 28\u00b0 6', long. 78\u00b0 34', and flowing in a south-easterly course for fifty miles, during which it divides the Budaon collectorate from those of Allygurh and Mynpooree, enters the district of Furruckabad, which it traverses for forty-five miles, and then rejoins the parent stream, in lat. 27\u00b0 26', long. 79\u00b0 39'.\n\nGUNGA BAL.\u2014A small lake in Cashmere, on the Haramuk Mountain, on the north-eastern boundary of the valley. It is a mile and a half long, and two or three-hundred yards wide. Its appearance presents nothing remarkable, and its dimensions, it has been seen, are inconsiderable; but it is regarded with a superstitious veneration of the deepest kind by the Hindoos. Pilgrims flock to its banks, and into its waters are thrown such\nfragments of bone as remain undestroyed by the fires lighted by Hindoo feeling to consume the fleshly habitation from which the spirit has departed.

It is surrounded by a ruined\u00b3 wall, but otherwise has, according to Barr,\u2074 a pleasing appearance: \"The approach to Gunnour, where we halted, is extremely picturesque; a few huts on a rising ground, overhung by some large and drooping trees, bounding one side of the prospect, the other being formed by a large and handsome caravanserai, with its embattled wall and towers reflected on the surface of a beautifully clear tank.\" The road in this part of the route is generally good, though in a few places heavy.

It takes a north-westerly direction, along the north-eastern base of the high steep ridge of Malown,\u00b2 which separates it from the Gunbhirur, holding a parallel course at a distance of about three miles. The Gunrora, after a course of about fifteen miles, falls into the Sutlej, in lat. 31\u00b0 17', long. 76\u00b0 48'.\n\nGUNTOOR,\u00b9 a collectorate under the presidency of Madras, is bounded on the north by the Kistna river, which separates it from the Nizam's dominions and the British district of Masulipatam; on the south by Nellore and the Bay of Bengal; on the east by Masulipatam; and on the west by the Cuddapah collectorate and the territory of the Nizam. It lies between lat. 15\u00b0 37' and 16\u00b0 50', and long. 79\u00b0 15'-80\u00b0 59', and the area, according to official return, is 4,960\u00b2 square miles.\u00b2 The seacoast of this district extends from Gollapalem, in a direction from south-west to north-east, for\n\n* According to another\u00b9 return, however, only 3,500 square miles; but this is obviously below the actual extent.\nGUNTOOR.\n\nthirty miles, and subsequently in a direction, first eastward, and afterwards south-eastward, for about twenty-five miles more, to the principal mouth of the Kistna. This coast is generally called the Golconda coast, which is understood to commence at about lat. $15^\\circ 20'$, and to proceed northwards, in contradistinction to the coast of Coromandel, which extends from the limit just named to the vicinity of Adam's Bridge. The coast is so low as not to be easily distinguished at a safe distance, and is, moreover, beset by an extensive and dangerous bank, called the Shoal of Motapilly. In consequence of these dangers and impediments to navigation, this coast, for an extent of fifty-four miles, is scarcely frequented by shipping, especially during the north-east monsoon, which prevails throughout October, November, and December. In the extensive division of Palnad, forming the western part of the district, the country is very hilly, the geological formation being generally basaltic, and earthquakes, and other volcanic phenomena, have occasionally occurred. Farther eastward are extensive deposits of limestone, interspersed with syenite. The limestone in some places has a foliated texture, like slate, and is wrought by the native population for roofing their houses. In many places are extensive mines of rich iron-ore; malachite, and other indications of copper-ore, are of frequent occurrence. The soil in Palnad, or the western part, being stony, and of a rugged nature, is rather unproductive, and in most places overrun with jungle; in the vicinity of the sea, it is sterile and sandy; but the intervening portion, in the middle of the district, is dark-coloured loamy; and in the vicinity of the river Kistna, it is deep, alluvial, and very fertile. The principal river is the Kistna, which, coming from the territory of the Nizam, flows, on its entrance into this district, first in a northerly direction for twenty-three miles, then has an easterly course for fifty-seven miles, to Govindpur, and subsequently proceeds in a north-easterly direction for twenty-one miles, to Kantamuddi, separating for the whole of that distance the territory of the Nizam from the district of Guntoor. At the last-named point, it takes a direction south-east, and for 110 miles, to its mouth, forms the dividing line between this district and the British district of Masulipatam. This river, formerly little available for irrigation, has recently, through\nthe liberal efforts of the government, become an important and valuable instrument for diffusing fertility over the adjacent country. To navigation, the violence of its current, and the varying, uncertain depth of its stream, are great impediments. The other rivers are the Gundama, the Nullamuda, which rises in the Innacoondah hills, in Palmaud, and traverses a course of 100 miles before it reaches the sea, filling several tanks in its way; and also the Nagoler and the Pillaur; but these are merely torrents, nearly or entirely dry during the hot season. Tanks, or artificial lakes, are not numerous, though of importance for irrigation. This district lies within the influence of the south-west and north-east monsoons. The former commences in May, and occasional rains continue till the month of August, moderating the heat of the land winds, which blow sometimes with great force across this part of the country. A great quantity of rain also falls in the months of September, October, and November. The heat at Guntoor is greatest from the middle of March to the middle of June.\n\nThe zoology of Guntoor is meagre, there being fewer wild animals in this part of India than in almost any other. Cholum (Holcus sorghum) is the staple alimentary crop of the district, and rice in considerable quantity is grown in the low tracts along the seashore and the courses of the river; bajra (Holcus spicatus) is also grown in considerable quantities; besides oil-seeds, turmeric, onions, capsicum, and various succulent vegetables. The principal commercial crops are betel, tobacco, and cotton. Cotton cloths are manufactured to a considerable extent, and exported to the territory of the Nizam, as well as to the British districts. The cattle of Guntoor are in great repute, and bullocks are exported in great numbers. The price of a pair of the best breed varies from 7l. to 14l.\n\nOf the population, various estimates, widely distant from each other, have been at different times put forth. The severe famines which have repeatedly visited the country, and the consequent diminution of numbers by mortality and emigration, may account for part of the discrepancy. Little advantage, however, would result from any attempt to reconcile the conflicting statements on the subject. It may suffice to state, that in a recent official document, the population of Guntoor is given at 570,089. Of the inhabitants, about one-eighteenth\nare Mussulmans, the rest Hindoos; and of these last about a seventh are of the Brahmin caste.\n\nThe circar of Guntoor proper is composed of five large zemindaries, which were permanently assessed, in 1801, at 122,545l. This assessment was light almost beyond example: it was below the estimates founded on the collections of the seven preceding years, and even to the extent of 2,450l. below the offers made by the zemindars themselves; the revenue authorities of the day being determined that, whatever error was committed in fixing the future peshcush, should be on the side of extreme moderation. The result was, that for many years some of the zemindars realized from sixty to sixty-five, and others from seventy to ninety per cent. above the peshcush. Waiving all reference to the irregular profits derived from the extortionate cesses and compulsory contributions which the zemindars appear to have systematically levied from the ryots, the difference between the rental received by the former, and the demand of the state, was, on an average of years, so considerable as to admit of their sustaining, without difficulty, any loss which an unfavourable season, or even a succession of such seasons, might occasion to them. The principle of compensation is indeed the very basis of the permanent settlement, and the zemindar has no more right to claim a relaxation in the terms of his contract, on the ground of unfavourable seasons, than the government has to enhance its demand when cultivation is extended, crops are abundant, or prices high. The assessment under the permanent settlement was paid in full, and with great regularity, until 1830. In that year, the zemindars began to fall into arrear, and thenceforward their embarrassments continued to increase. The impression upon the minds of the home authorities was, that these zemindaries had been depopulated and impoverished by the famine and pestilence which raged throughout the Northern Circars, and especially Guntoor, in the years 1832, 1833, and 1834; and their zemindars were consequently regarded as the victims of misfortune, deserving of indulgent consideration. In 1836, the experiment was tried of employing the zemindars as managers of their estates (then under attachment) on behalf of the government. The results disappointed the expectations which had been formed of this plan, the balances having\nincreased under it from \u00a3154,718 to \u00a3842,370. This continuing, the zemindars were called upon, in 1842, to surrender their zemindarry rights into the hands of government, on condition of receiving a sufficient maintenance, the estates to be managed by the collector till brought into a state of prosperity, and, this result attained, to be restored to the zemindars. But the manifold abuses prevailing under the management of the zemindars, and which had led to the ruin of their estates, were not at that time detected. More recent investigations fully established the facts, that the zemindars had acted from first to last with systematic dishonesty and breach of trust; that of their avowed collections during the period of their management, a portion only reached the public treasury; that the sum sanctioned for the maintenance of the zemindars, and for charges, was considerably exceeded, and the annual accounts were so framed as to make the results tally with their representations; that they let villages at ostensibly reduced rents, with secret conditions for the payment of an additional sum, which was often secured by a bond executed as if for a debt; that they granted away the revenue lands as rent free to their servants or dependants, to dancing-girls, to Brahmins, or to bankers who had lent them money; and some of the zemindars went even a step farther, and executed ante-dated leases, with the reservation of a beneficial interest to themselves. These various instances of bad faith naturally raised the question how far the parties guilty of them were entitled to claim the restoration of powers, the conditions of which they had so grossly violated. It was shown upon undoubted authority, that these zemindars wasted, in a long-continued course of extravagance, excess, and litigation, not only those legitimate resources of their estates, which were amply sufficient to meet the occasional occurrence of calamitous seasons, but the additional sums which they extorted from the ryots under various pretences. Looking, therefore, at all the circumstances, which became fully known in 1849, at the faithless and fraudulent conduct of the zemindars as managers of their estates on account of the government; at the direct and positive loss therefrom, amounting to not less than \u00a3800,000, which their vices and mismanagement had entailed upon the finances of India; at the disastrous consequences spread thereby over\nsucceeding years in the exhaustion of the resources of the district, which, under the careful management of able and experienced revenue officers, for a considerable period had not revived sufficiently to afford the fixed amount of the peshcush, the home authorities resolved that the zemindarry rights should not be restored, but an annual allowance of 3,480l. be granted for the maintenance of the several zemindars' families, to be distributed as follows:\u2014To Vasseyreddy, 1,200l.; Muhrauze, 1,200l.; Chickaloorpaud, 360l.; Sultanapillay, 360l.; Raypillay, 360l.\n\nGuntoor constitutes the southern portion of the maritime tract known as the Five Northern Circars, which were ceded to the East-India Company, in 1765, by the emperor of Delhi. The grant, however, was not rendered available in respect to Guntoor until 1788, when the Nizam surrendered the circar, and the British thus became possessed of the whole line of coast from Juggernaut to Comorin.\n\nThe great northern route from Madras to Masulipatam and the Northern Circars passes through this district, and sends a branch to the left, or north-west, to Hyderabad.\n\nGuntoor, the principal place, Nizampatam, and Vinukonda, are described under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\n**GUNTOOR,** the principal place of the British district of the same name, in the territory subject to the presidency of Madras, is situate about 18 miles S.W. of the right bank of the great river Kistna, and 30 from the Coromandel coast, or western shore of the Bay of Bengal. The surrounding country is open and flat, but free from swamps or stagnant water; and to these circumstances is owing the salubrity by which it is characterized. The soil of the country around is black, and produces luxuriant crops of gram (Cicer arietinum), cholam (Holcus sorghum), and cotton. The place is divided into what are called the Old Town and New Town, both very irregularly built, and in general much overcrowded, especially in those parts inhabited by the poorer classes. The population is estimated at 20,000. Distance from Bangalore, N.E., 800 miles; Masulipatam, W., 47; Ongole, N., 63; Nellore, N., 133; Madras, N., 225.

The object of superstition is a large fragment of rock lying in the Lidur river, and worn by the current into what the Hindoos fancy a representation of an elephant's head, to which a trunk, ears, and eyes have been added by human art. The superstitious feeling caused by this object results from the belief that Ganesa has the head of an elephant.

The population is returned at 7,168 persons. It is situate on the right bank of the Ganges, four miles below the reunion of the Burha Ganga, or old course of the Ganges, with the present main channel, which, a mile and half above the town, is crossed by a much-frequented ferry, on which fifteen boats constantly ply. It may be regarded as the port of Meerut and the adjoining part of the Doab, as the Ganges is the channel of considerable inland navigation from the sea to this ferry, and in a less degree to Sukurtal, fifty miles higher up. Both banks of the river are for several miles in width overgrown with thick grassy jungle, infested in the dry season with tigers and other wild beasts, and in the rainy season laid extensively under water by the swollen stream. Even in the dry season, when the larger craft cannot proceed higher than Furruckabad, about 150 miles lower down, Gurmuktesar can be reached by boats admitting of some comfortable accommodation to the traveller. That in which Lumsden proceeded in the dry season from this place to Calcutta, was of about twenty tons burthen, forty feet in length, ten in breadth, and navigated by a master and eight rowers.

It extends over the south-western declivity of the Himalaya, and is throughout a vast range of mountains of enormous height, intermingled with several valleys, the drainage of the whole ultimately finding its way to the Ganges. The principal channels are those of the Tonse, of the Jumna, and of the Bhageerettee, one of the remote sources of the Ganges. The most elevated part of the country is the north and northeast, where the peaks about the Tonse, the Jumnotri peaks, and several others, are more than 20,000 feet above the sea.\n\n* The appellation is said to be derived from Ghers (fort), and to have been bestowed on account of the number of such edifices formerly existing in the country.\nThe highest summit is probably the peak of Kedarnath, having an elevation of 23,062 feet. Rikkee-Kasee, nearly parallel with the southern boundary, is the lowest spot in the territory, being only 1,377 feet above the sea. It is the point where the Ganges touches upon the Dehra Doon. The confluence of the Tonse and Jumna, which is the lowest point of the aggregate of valleys drained by those rivers, is rather higher than Rikkee-Kasee, being 1,686 feet above the sea. A few small tracts, extending along the lower courses of the Bhageerettee and Aluknunda, and the Jumna previously to its confluence with the Tonse, have elevations less than 5,000 feet; but by much the greater part of the country lies considerably above that height. The only alluvial tract of any considerable extent is that stretching southwards from Teeree to the southern frontier, in length about twenty-five miles, and in breadth about twelve, having an elevation above the sea of from 2,500 to 1,400 feet. The lower and more south-westerly mountains, rising over the Dehra Doon, are of the formations called by geologists transition or secondary; such as compact limestone, alternating with soft earthy slate, and in some places with roofing slate. Trap rocks occur in great abundance, cutting the other strata in dykes. The limestone is overlaid extensively by a stratum of quartzose sandstone, which is continued to a considerable distance eastward, where it forms the elevated summit of Soorkunda. The slate in some places becomes a distinct greywacke. Great beds of gypsum are sometimes observable in the limestone. A little farther north are enormous strata of quartz. Twelve or fifteen miles north of Mussoorie, or about lat. 30\u00b0 40', the mountains assume a primitive character, passing into talcose schist, talcose gneiss, and mica-slate; and still farther north, or in about lat. 30\u00b0 50', becoming a real gneiss. Northward of this, and about the sources of the Bhageerettee, the nature of the formation seems to be a point greatly contested. Hodgson pronounces it granite. Everest also states that, \"from Gungotree to Dilaree (a distance of above twelve miles), the river runs through a\n\n* On this point Jacquemont observes: \"Elle [la roche] me parait une de celles que, faute de les connaitre, on a appel\u00e9es autrefois du omn de Trapp. La difference de certaines grauwackes quartzeuses \u00e0 cette est l\u00e9g\u00e8re.\"\ngloomy chasm in the granite;\" and enumerates, as follows, the succession of formations, from Gangotri downwards: \"1. Granite; 2. gneiss and mica-slate; 3. talcose gneiss and talc-slate; 4. clay-slate; 5. Mussooree limestone; 6. quartz rock, or rather quartzy sandstone, and greywacke slate.\" Herbert, however, maintains most peremptorily, that the formation which has usually been considered granite, is gneiss, and that granite is only found in fragments. As this difference has been more largely adverted to in another place, it will be less necessary to dwell upon it here. In the north-east of the district, south of the upper part of the Bhageerettee, and between the river and the frontier of British Gurwhal, a great number of summits of enormous elevation, and covered with perennial snow, will probably forever exclude human footsteps. On the eastern frontier, however, along the course of the Mandakini, or Mundagnee, the formation is generally gneiss, which Herbert, from the following passage, appears to regard as also forming the summit of the great mountain Kedarnath. \"The correspondence of appearance between the nearer ridges, which have evidently furnished these fragments [of gneiss] and the great Soommeroo or Kedarnath peak, attests the fact that here also, as at the head of the Ganges, this rock attains an elevation of nearly 23,000 feet.\"\n\nThe metallic deposits of Gurwhal are either scanty or have been little explored, as scarcely any mineral wealth is obtained from its territory. Herbert states that he found at Kedarnath a specimen of granite in which occurred specks of native gold; and adds, \"Considering, indeed, all the circumstances of the case, it is far from improbable that gold will yet be found in its native matrix within our mountains.\" The sands of the Aluknunda, flowing along the eastern frontier, contain gold; and when Moorcroft passed, in 1819, about fifteen persons were employed in searching for the grains. He states that, under proper encouragement, it might afford profitable employment for hundreds; and in this view he is supported by Herbert.\n\n* See article Kumaon.\n\n\u2020 Called the Kalee by Herbert: \"We have now reached the Kalee (branch of the Aluknunda), and here the recent examination of this tract equally established the prevalence of gneiss, from Okee Muth Ioola (rope bridge) to Kedur-nath, the source of the river.\"\n\n\u2021 This is stated by the author to be merely conjectural.\nGURWHAL.\n\nThe quantity, however, obtained by searching the sands of rivers in British Gurwhal, has been so trifling that the government has remitted \\(^2\\) the per-centage paid on the produce under \\(^3\\) id. 287. Herbert\\(^2\\) states that the mountain region between the Sutlej and the Brahmapootra, and consequently Gurwhal, which lies between those limits, is rich in copper, iron, lead, and antimony. The rivers of Gurwhal,\u2014the Tons, Jumna, Bhageerettee, Bhillung, Mandakini, Aluknunda, Aglar, Pabur, Rupin, Soong, Budiar, and Banal,\u2014are separately adverted to in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe climate of Gurwhal is hot in the low tracts along the banks of the Aluknunda, on the southern frontier, where Raper,\\(^3\\) in the beginning of May, found the thermometer to reach 101\u00b0 in the shade. In the lower mountains, having an elevation of from 5,000 to 8,000 feet, the climate is moderate, the thermometer seldom exceeding 75\u00b0\\(^4\\) in the hottest part of the year. In midwinter, frosts\\(^6\\) are frequent, with occasional falls of snow. The periodical or monsoon rains are very heavy, commencing in the middle of June and ending towards the middle of September. The northern part of the territory, containing the lofty peaks of the Himalayas, rises beyond the limits of perpetual congelation.\n\nIn the higher mountains bears\\(^*\\) are common; the lower are infested, in addition to these, by leopards and tigers.\\(^6\\) Monkeys\\(^7\\) are numerous, even as high as Sookhee, which has an elevation of 8,869 feet,\\(^6\\) and is in lat. 31\u00b0. According to Skinner, they are not venerated by the inhabitants of the mountains, as in some other parts of India.\n\nThe rural economy of the natives of Gurwhal varies with the nature of the soil and the degrees of elevation. Scarcely any fruit-trees are cultivated except the walnut, apricot, and mulberry; but the second is of very indifferent quality, and the last-named is cultivated for the leaves, not with a view to the production of silk, but to be used as fodder for cattle. In the low ground, capable of irrigation and having a warm climate, rice is the principal crop. Besides small quantities of sugarcane\\(^8\\) and of cotton, there are raised ginger, turmeric, sweet potato, and hemp, the latter cultivated for the supply of bhang, as well\n\n* The zoology and botany of Gurwhal do not differ from those of the other hill states.

In more elevated tracts, where the surface on the mountain-slopes is generally formed into artificial terraces by embankments, the crops are wheat, barley, buckwheat, battu or amaranthus, mundua or Eleusine corocana, a remarkably prolific plant; pulse of various sorts, and oil-seeds. The poppy\\(^1\\) is very generally cultivated, either for opium or the seed, which is a favourite food of the natives. The plough is no better than a forked log, drawn by oxen, guided by women;\\(^2\\) and the ground is rather scratched than ploughed. The ears of corn when ripe are cut off the stalks, which are then eaten down by kine, kept either for their milk or for labour, as the influence of Brahminical prejudices causes their slaughter to be regarded as impious. They are very small, of dark-brown colour, short-horned, and with a hump on the withers like those of Hindostan. The sheep, also small, are of a brown colour and coarse-woolled; the goats large, and generally white. No family is without a dog, of dark-brown colour, middle size, well covered with strong hair, and of a mongrel aspect. Horses are rare,\u2014even the ghunt or mountain pony; and asses are unknown.\n\nThe houses are substantially built of layers of stone and squared beams placed alternately. They have generally three stories, each from six to seven feet high. The lowest shelters the cattle, the middle is used as a granary, and the family resides in the upper story, the accommodation of which is enlarged by a strongly-constructed gallery all round. The roof, nearly flat, is generally of slabs or coarse slate laid on thick beams, and projects over both walls and gallery. The communication between the floors is by steep stairs, or rather ladders.\n\nThe natives of Gurwhal are in general below the middle size, their stature (according to one traveller) rarely exceeding five feet.\\(^3\\) Their complexions are less dark than those of the Hindoos of the plains: on the other hand, while red or brown hair may sometimes be observed among the latter, the hue of the hair and beard in Gurwhal is almost invariably dark. The beard is scanty, especially on the cheeks, not strong on the upper lip, fullest on the chin. It is most deficient in men having the Mongolian aspect, who in some instances show no trace of this appendage of the male. On the contrary, those\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Royle, Botany of Himalaya, 490.\n\\(^2\\) Jacquemont, Voyages, iv. 113.\n\\(^3\\) Id. 110.\nwho have long narrow faces, prominent aquiline noses, and fully-developed foreheads, are best provided with beards. They are, according to Jacquemont,\\(^4\\) a mild, peaceable, timid race, remarkably devoid of mental energy, and living tranquilly, without any control from fixed law, and very little from authority of any kind. Others, however, do not represent them as so strongly marked with those features of the golden age. Frazer relates, that coming to a village where only women, children, and decrepit men were found, on asking them what had become of the able-bodied part of the population, he received for answer, \"that they had gone\\(^5\\) to buy corn or steal sheep,\" with a tone and manner indicating that they spoke of nothing extraordinary or requiring apology. Hodgson\\(^6\\) also states that they plunder their eastern neighbours of the Kedarnath districts, and pride themselves on such exploits. This writer reports them to have neither fire-arms, swords, nor war-hatchets; their only weapons being bows and arrows.\n\nGoitre is common here, as in the other Himalaya tracts, and cannot be traced to any certain, or even apparently probable cause. Perhaps the most plausible opinion is that of Traill,\\(^7\\) who attributes the disease to the pernicious effects of the damp cold blasts of the mountains on the glandular structure of the naked throats of the mountaineers. Their clothing is made of thick warm woollen cloth, produced for the most part by the joint labours of the men and the women; the former, when stationary, being generally occupied in spinning; the women assisting in the weaving department. A piece of this cloth, seventeen or eighteen yards long and two feet wide, is sold for six or seven shillings. It is manufactured to such extent as to form a small article of traffic to the plains. The dress consists of trousers of this cloth, and a frock gathered in folds about the loins, and reaching to the knees, being girt about the waist with a narrow woollen scarf. The upper part of the shoes worn is of woollen cloth, the soles are of leather. The head-dress is a brown woollen cap or bonnet. No part of the dress is ever washed; and a large portion of the population being in extreme poverty, they are often wretchedly ragged. The women, in addition to pounding corn and other toilsome domestic pursuits, perform the greater part of the agricultural labours, and in consequence are broken-down, haggard, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^4\\) Ut supra, iii.\n\n\\(^5\\) As.

They wear the nath or metallic ring in the nose, and enormous rings of silver or copper round their ankles. Hodgson states that polyandry is not known; and Skinner, on the contrary, that it is universal, each woman having four husbands. The population generally claims Rajpoot descent, and Brahmins are numerous, but often so poor as to be obliged to share the labours of the ordinary peasantry.\n\nThe religion is Brahminism, Gurwhal containing several places of pilgrimages for the Hindoos; such as Jumnotri, Devprayaga, Kedarnath, and Gangotri, probably the most distinguished of any. Shrines of minor sanctity are very numerous, every mountain or remarkable spot having its local divinity. But, however intense and enthusiastic the devotion to Brahminism, little regard is shown to the maintenance of the purity of its dogmas and practices; all (Brahmins not excepted) eat every sort of flesh except that of kine. The manner in which they celebrate their most sacred festivals is not unworthy of the purpose of their assemblage. \"They dance to the sound of strange music, and intoxicate themselves with a sort of vile spirit, brewed here from grain and particular roots, sometimes, it is said, sharpened by pepper. The dance is most grotesque and savage; a multitude of men taking hands, sometimes in a circle, sometimes in line, beating time with their feet, bend with one accord, first nearly to the earth with their faces, then backwards, and then sidewise, with various wild contortions. These and their uncouth dress of black and grey blankets, give a peculiar air of brutal ferocity to the assemblage; the men dance all day, and in the evening they are joined by the women, who mix indiscriminately with them, and keep up the dancing and intoxication till the night is far advanced. They continue this frantic kind of worship for several days; and in truth it is much in unison with their general manners and habits.\" Of their ridiculous superstitions, one of the most extraordinary is the rite or exploit of barat, performed in honour of Mahadeva. A cable of grass, about two inches in diameter, is stretched from the edge of a lofty cliff to the valley below, where it is securely fastened by means of posts driven into the ground.\nGURWHAL.\n\nA wooden saddle, constructed with a deep groove below, which fits on the cable and slides along it, serves as a seat for a man called the badi, who, after the sacrifice of a kid, is started from the upper extremity, with stones or sandbags fastened to his feet, and descends along the inclined rope with such velocity that the friction produces a volume of smoke, through the greater part of his course. Persons are stationed at the lower extremity to receive the badi, and moderate the shock which he must otherwise experience. He receives a rupee for every hundred cubits of rope, which is sometimes 2,000 cubits long. Formerly, if the badi were thrown to the ground by the breaking of the rope, or any other cause, and he retained life after the shock, the spectators immediately despatched him with a sword; but this is now prohibited by the British authorities. The bast or cable is cut into pieces, and distributed amongst the villagers, to be hung as charms from the eaves of their houses; and the ceremony is expected to confer fertility on the crops of those thus provided.\n\nThe language is a patois of Hindostanee, and is readily understood by the natives of the plains.\n\nAccording to the traditional account given to Frazer, Gurwhal was originally divided into above twenty petty states, which, about 500 years ago, were consolidated into one by a bold and rapacious adventurer from the plains. Previously to the Goorkha invasion in 1803, the dominions of the rajah of Gurwhal comprised, in addition to his present territory, the fertile district of Dehra Doon, and the western portion (being about one-half) of the present British province of Kumaon. The Goorkha force which invaded the country, conducted by several veteran commanders, was very inadequately opposed by Purdumim Sah, the rajah, an indolent and unwarlike prince, who, at the head of 12,000 men, was defeated and slain at Gurudwara, in the Dehra Doon. On the occurrence of this event, the inhabitants of Gurwhal discontinued all resistance to the Goorkhas, who made ruthless use of their victory. According to Frazer, they in the course of about twelve years sold 200,000 of the people into slavery; but this is palpably an exaggeration, as a population not exceeding 300,000 could scarcely have been capable of supplying two-thirds of that number of saleable slaves in twelve years. The number, how-\n\n---\n\n3 Jacquemont, ut supra, iv. 111.\n4 Tour in Himalaya, 389.\n5 Frazer, Tour in Himalaya, 54, 867, 868, 869.\n6 Batten, Report on the Settlement of Gurwhal, 27.\n7 As.

Frazer, ut supra, 384.\never, of the unhappy victims of the cupidity of the conquerors was no doubt very great, as Moorcroft found the fertile tract about the Terrai quite depopulated, in consequence of the deportation* and sale of the natives as slaves by the Goorkhas. Sheeo Dursun Shah, the son of the slain rajah, had fled the country after the fatal battle which had given it to the Goor-khas. In 1815, when the success of the East-India Company's army had put an end to the Goorkha dominion, this prince was restored to the western portion of the territory formerly enjoyed by his family. The Dehra Doon, on the south, was reserved to the East-India Company, as was also Eastern Gurwhal. The portion of Gurwhal restored to the rajah is divided from the remainder, on the east, by a line which, commencing in lat. $31^\\circ 5'$, long. $79^\\circ 20'$, with a south-westerly direction, skirts the great glacier, giving rise to the Bhageerettee, and thence continued southward to the source of the Mandakini, follows the course of that river to its confluence with the Aluknunda, along the line of which it proceeds to its junction with the Bhageerettee, and in a westerly direction down the last-mentioned river to Bikkee-Kasee, where it touches upon the Dehra Doon. The rajah holds his territory subordinate to the East-India Company, and the following conditions were attached to the grant:\u20141. The abolition of the slave-trade. 2. The furnishing of labourers and supplies for British troops when required, to the extent of the rajah's ability. 3. The extension of every facility to British subjects and others trading in the Gurwhal territory, or in the countries beyond it, and a general conformation on the part of the rajah to the directions of the British government. 4. The obligation not to alienate or mortgage any part of the territory without the consent of the British government. The grant, subject to the above conditions, was made in perpetuity, and\n\n* Raper gives a description of the practical working of this cruel system of oppression, as he witnessed it at the fair of Hurdwar about the year 1808. \"At the foot of the pass leading from Harca-Pairi, is a Gurchali Choki, or post, to which slaves are brought down from the hills and exposed for sale. Many hundreds of poor wretches of both sexes, from three to thirty years of age, are annually disposed of in the way of traffic. Those slaves are brought down from all parts of the interior of the hills, and sold at Haridwar at from ten to 150 rupees (from \u00a31. to about 15l.)\"\nGUR\u2014GUT.\n\nis dated March 4th, 1820. The rajah's dominions are under the inspection of the political agent in the Dehra Doon.\n\nThe amount of the population of native states can rarely be ascertained with any approach to precision: that of the rajah's portion of Gurwhal probably does not much exceed 100,000. This, however, is an estimate based on grounds purely conjectural; but, if near the truth, it will give a proportion of about twenty-two* to the square mile. The annual income is stated by Prinsep at 40,000 rupees (4,000\u00a3); by Moorcroft, at 60,000 (6,000\u00a3); by De Cruz, at a lac (10,000\u00a3).\n\nGURYS, in Bultistan or Little Thibet, is situate close to the northern boundary of Kashmir: it is an elevated valley, five miles long and one mile wide. The upper part of the Kishengunga flows in a direction from east to west along the bottom of the valley, which, though 7,200 feet above the sea, is surrounded by lofty and very abrupt peaks, chiefly of limestone.

Traill estimates the population of the entire of Kumaon at between twenty-seven and twenty-eight* to the square mile. In a recent official publication, the population of Kumaon, exclusive of British Gurwhal, is estimated at something more than twenty-three to the square mile. As Kumaon much excels the territory of the rajah in fertility and other natural resources, and more abounds in towns and villages, there can be no reasonable doubt that it has also a greater relative population. The natural resources of Koonawur are probably as well suited for maintaining population as those of the greater part of Gurwhal; yet Gerard estimates the relative density at less than five persons to the square mile.\n\n1 Ut supra, i. 178.\n2 Ut supra, i. 15.\n3 Ut supra, 48.\n4 Account of Koonawur, 5.\nGUZERAT.\n\ngentleman, named Sirdar Sukum Gourah Wunkmoonka, was shipped from England in 1850.\\(^1\\)\n\nGUZERAT.\\(^*\\)\u2014This large province, inclusive of the peninsula of Kattywar, and comprehending within its limits, together with several petty independent states, the whole dominions of the Guicowar, and those of his tributaries, is bounded on the north by the Gulf of Cutch and Rajpootana; on the south by the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Cambay, and the British collectorates of Broach,\\(^\u2020\\) Surat, Tannah, and Candeish; on the east by Candeish and Malwa; and on the west by Cutch, the collectorates of Surat and Broach, and the sea.

For the sake of convenience, the right of collecting the tributes due to the Guicowar was, by mutual agreement, transferred to the British government; but the pecuniary claims of the Guicowar are untouched by the arrangement, the British government merely performing the functions of receiving the tributes and paying them over. The general\nGUZERAT.\n\nthe extensive region marked out by those boundaries, a considerable portion is occupied by the Gulf of Cambay, and by the British district of Ahmedabad, which, extending about the gulf, is on all sides, except seaward, inclosed by the territory of the Guicowar. Of the whole territory, 19,850 square miles are stated to be comprised within the peninsula, or that part which may be marked off from the continent by a line drawn from the head of the Gulf of Cutch to the head of the Gulf of Cambay. The peninsula, with a small portion adjoining to it on the north-east, along the head of the Gulf of Cambay, are the only parts of the territory which have the advantage of seacoast. The Gulf of Cutch, which bounds the peninsula on the north and north-west, joins the Runn, or Salt Marsh, at Maliya, and from this point, which may be considered its head, its south-eastern shore, forming the north-western coast of the peninsula, is indented with numerous creeks, but so shoaly as not to admit the approach to land of ships of burthen above Nowanuggur, distant from Maliya about thirty miles. There ships may anchor in five or six fathoms, sheltered in some measure by a reef off shore; and, from possessing this advantage, the town is a place of considerable commerce. From Nowanuggur, the coast extends south-west twenty-eight miles, to Serryah, situate on the estuary of a small river, not admitting large vessels, which must anchor three miles at sea. From Serryah, the coast extends still in a direction south-west thirty miles, to lat. 22\u00b0 15', long. 69\u00b0 20', where a small runn or salt marsh joins the sea; and from the junction takes a southerly direction, nearly insulating the district of Okamandal, lying west of it. From the place where this small runn joins the Gulf of Cutch, the coast takes a direction north for ten miles, after which it suddenly turns south-west, and thus continues for twelve miles, and then bearing northward for eight more, it forms a bay, in the mouth of which, towards the north, is situate the island of Beyt, with its fort, once of considerable management of the estates of the tributaries remains with themselves; but the British government has been enabled to effect much good by procuring the abolition of infanticide, suttee, slave-trading, and other enormities, and by the establishment of a court of criminal justice, under the resident, assisted by the chiefs of the several states within the jurisdiction of the court, acting as assessors.\nGUZERAT.\n\nstrength. \"Abreast\" the castle, about midchannel between the islands, there are six and seven fathoms in one place, and three, four, and five fathoms around; the bottom being mostly rocky and uneven throughout the harbour.\" This harbour has the disadvantage of a shallow entrance, there being only about nine feet water on the bar at low water spring tides, but the rise of the tide is about fourteen feet. The headland forming the bay to the north-west, is called Soomia or Sonia, and is, in fact, an island separated from the mainland of Guzerat by a narrow navigable channel. The whole of the southern part of the Gulf of Cutch, along the north-west coast of Kattywar, is difficult and perilous for navigation by large vessels, being shallow, and having many islets, reefs, and rocks. From the headland opposite the island of Soomia, and forming the north-western angle of Guzerat, the coast turns first south-westward, subsequently southward, and lastly south-eastward, for a total distance of twenty-five miles, to Dwarka, called also Jigat, the shore being safe to approach, and of moderate height, with regular soundings from thirty-four to thirty-six fathoms, at the distance of seven or eight leagues, to ten or twelve fathoms near the coast. The shoal of Kulcheegud, seven or eight miles north of Jigat or Dwarka, interferes with the coasting navigation, and much vigilance is required to ascertain its limits, and to work round it. From Dwarka, the coast holds a direction south-east for 175 miles, to Diu Head, and is generally bold and safe to approach, though there are no good harbours for large ships. There are, however, several towns on the coast frequented by small trading vessels, and formerly some of them were places of resort for pirates infesting the Arabian Sea. Proceeding in a southeasterly direction from Dwarka, the towns occur in the following order:\u2014First, Meeanee, at the distance of forty-two miles, on the estuary of the river Boortoo; second, twenty miles beyond Meeanee, in the same direction, Poorbunder; third, twenty miles distant, Nuvveebunder; fourth, thirty miles distant, Mangroal; fifth, ten miles farther, Chorwaur; sixth, fifteen miles farther, Somnath Puttun; seventh, eighteen miles farther, Korynaur; twenty miles beyond which is Diu Head, the most southern point of the peninsula, in lat. 20\u00b0 42', long. 70\u00b0 51'; and close to it, eastward, the island and harbour of\nGUZERAT.\n\nDiu. Thence the coast takes a north-easterly direction for eighty miles, to Gopnath, and in this interval, at the distance of thirty miles, is the port of Jafferabad, on the estuary of a small river, which, though shoal, affords shelter to ships, as, when the tide is out, they lie without injury on a bottom of soft mud. Mowah, a town about thirty miles farther to the north-east, is on the inmost or most northerly shore of a small bay, where ships may anchor in from seven to ten fathoms, but have no shelter from south-westerly or westerly winds. North-east from this port twenty miles, is Gopnath Point, the south-western headland of the Gulf of Cambay, in lat. $21^\\circ 12'$, long. $72^\\circ 6'$, marked by a dangerous shoal, projecting four miles eastward and nine miles northward. Between Jafferabad and Mowah are numerous small islets and rocks, from half to three-quarters of a mile from shore, the principal being Searbett, between which and the mainland vessels may lie sheltered from the south-west monsoon. For the remainder of the distance to Gopnath, the coast is clear, the water deepening rapidly. At Gopnath, the coast turns northward for ten miles, then for a similar distance north-eastward to Allung, on the southern limit of a portion of the British district of Ahmedabad (of which it forms part), for thirty-five miles, to the estuary of the river Geyla, where the territory of the Guicowar again closes down on the sea, the coast holding a northerly direction for twelve miles, to Gondalla. This place is situate at the southern limit of another portion of the British district of Ahmedabad, the coast of which extends northward thirty miles, to the head of the Gulf of Cambay, at the estuary of the river Saburmuttee. In the vicinity of this point, the sea is joined by the south-eastern extremity of the Runn, a salt marsh which, extending in a north-westerly direction about seventy-five miles, with a breadth varying from five to twelve miles, joins the Northern Runn, communicating with the Gulf of Cutch, about lat. $23^\\circ 5'$, long. $71^\\circ 45'$. From the estuary of the Saburmuttee, the coast, holding a direction generally eastward for about fourteen miles, along the head of the Gulf of Cambay and the mouth of the estuary of the river Myhee, as far as Kurode, belongs to the territory of the rajah of Cambay. Thus the seacoast, extending from the head or inmost extremity of the Gulf of Cutch round the peninsula, and across the head\nof the Gulf of Cambay to Kurode, is 531 miles in total length; and if sixty-five miles (the length of the British portion of the coast) be deducted, the remainder, or 466 miles, will be found to be the length of coast belonging to the subordinate chieftains of Kattywar and the nawaub of Cambay. In that length, it has been stated that there are numerous small havens and creeks, admitting coasting craft and other vessels of moderate size, and many roadsteads, where ships of considerable burthen may lie at anchor in fine weather; but with the exception of the harbours Diu and Beyt, there are none which afford shelter for large ships. The Gulf of Cambay especially is very shoaly, and of difficult navigation; and about fifty or sixty square miles of its northern part is left dry by the tide at low water. About two miles off the eastern shore of the peninsula, and midway between the head of the gulf and the mouth of it, are the island\u00b2 and reef of Perim, useful to navigators, as affording shelter to shipping anchored in the road of Gogo. It is not improbable that at some remote period, beyond record, the peninsula may have been an island separated from continental India by a narrow and shallow channel, which, in a long succession of ages, has been silted up by deposits from the sea, and thus converted into the present Runn. In the vicinity of the Runn, and all round the coast, the country is but slightly elevated; and of the numerous hills and mountains in the interior, none appear to stretch down in bold headlands to the sea. Though there are many groups of mountains or hills variously arranged, the general elevation of the surface is toward the middle of the peninsula, whence streams flow in every direction\u2014north-eastward to the Runn; eastward to the Gulf of Cambay; south-eastward, southward, and south-westward to the Arabian Sea; north-westward and northward to the Gulf of Cutch. In this internal elevation, there is, however, a sensible depression, constituting the extensive valley of the river Bhader, which rises at Kirkoon, about lat. 22\u00b0 10', long. 71\u00b0 17', and sixty miles from the Runn, at the northeastern limit of the peninsula, the source being close to the position of the water-heads, throwing the streams north-eastward to the Runn and south-westward down the valley of the Bhader to the Arabian Sea. North-west of this valley is an elevated rugged country, consisting of irregular ranges of hills,\nGUZERAT.\n\nof no great elevation, but in the aggregate forming a group, the greatest length of which, being from west to east, is about 120 miles, with an average breadth of about forty miles. At its eastern extremity, it joins, near Choteela, a low range, in few parts reaching an elevation\\(^8\\) of 400 feet, and running from that place in a direction slightly inclined eastward of due south. The southern extremity of this low group expands into the Geer, a rugged, rocky, undulating tract, covered with woods and stunted jungle, and of surface so exceedingly difficult and uneven, that for perhaps twenty miles a space cannot be found large enough to pitch a tent. The innumerable gorges and ravines of this rugged tract afford beds to a great number of streams or torrents, having considerable volumes of water in the rains, but becoming either greatly shrunken or quite devoid of currents during the dry season. The numerous fastnesses furnish lurking-places for banditti, who are the more secure in them, from the fact of the atmosphere a great part of the year being almost inevitably fatal to strangers attempting to penetrate into the Geer. Eastward of the Geer, and isolated from it, is the mountain of Palithana, 1,500 feet high, and noted for the great number of Jain temples and monastic establishments by which it is surmounted. But the most elevated and important among the mountains of the peninsula is the steep granitic clump of peaks called the Geernar, near the ancient city of Joonagurb, in the prant or district of Soruth, famed for the vast number, magnitude, and costliness of the shrines, places of pilgrimage, and monastic retreats which it possesses, of the Jains, Brahminists, and Mussulmans. Besides these, the only noticeable mountains in the peninsula are those of the Burda group, near Poorbunder, on the western coast\u2014a circular cluster, about thirty miles in circuit, and at the loftiest part, near Goomlee, having an elevation of nearly 2,000 feet.\n\nThe mainland of Guzerat, as contradistinguished from the peninsula, has some considerable rivers. The Saburmuttee, rising at Meerpoor, in the Rajpoot state of Odeypore, holds a generally southerly course of about thirty miles, crosses the frontier into Guzerat about lat. \\(24^\\circ 19'\\), long. \\(73^\\circ 11'\\), and flowing generally southward through this territory for about 180 miles, passes in its course by the city of Ahmedabad, and falls\nGUZERAT.\n\ninto the Gulf of Cambay. It is described as a broad rapidly-flowing river. About forty miles farther west, the Bunass, rising in Mount Aboo, crosses the northern frontier into Guzerat, through which it holds a south-westerly course of ninety miles, falling into the Great Runn or Salt Marsh. To the eastward of the Saburmuttee, and between it and the Myhee or Muhi, which flows in some degree parallel and at the distance of about forty-five miles from it, are several intervening streams, the most important of which are the Seri, the Meshwa, the Watruk, the Karree, and the Hautmuttee, all falling into the Saburmuttee. The Myhee or Muhi, rising near Amjherra, takes a circuitous course, first northward, in which direction it flows through the dominions of Holkar, and then forms the boundary between the native states of Banswarra and Pertaubghur. Subsequently turning south-westward, it divides the petty state of Dongurpore from that of Banswarra. After a course of about 200 miles, it crosses into Guzerat, through which it holds the same direction for about seventy miles, to lat. $22^\\circ 53'$, long. $73^\\circ 22'$, where, touching on the British district of Kaira, it flows along its south-eastern boundary for eighty miles, dividing it from the territory of the Guicowar, as far as its fall into the Gulf of Cambay, in lat. $22^\\circ 10'$, long. $72^\\circ 30'$. It is a considerable river, running generally between high banks much indented by ravines. The tides are felt for a distance of thirty miles from its mouth, and during spring tides and in the rainy season, it for ten miles above that outlet forms a magnificent body of water six miles in breadth. About forty miles south of its mouth, is the estuary of the great river Nerbudda, which, rising in Amarkanta, in the British territory of Saugor and Nerbudda, about lat. $22^\\circ 40'$, long. $81^\\circ 44'$, takes a westerly course of about 594 miles, to lat. $22^\\circ 8'$, long. $74^\\circ 20'$, where, crossing the eastern frontier of this territory (Guzerat), and continuing to hold a course nearly due west for about 146 miles, it passes into the British district of Broach, which it divides into two nearly equal portions, and about thirty-five miles farther westward, falls into the Gulf of Cambay. The Taptee, rising in Gondwana, within the British Saugor and Nerbudda territory, takes a westerly course, in a great measure parallel to the Nerbudda, for about 321 miles, to the eastern frontier of this territory,\nGUZERAT.\n\nwhich it enters near Kookurmoonda, and continuing to hold a westerly course for about ninety-three miles, passes into the British district of Surat, through which it flows for about twenty-two miles, to its fall into the Gulf of Cambay. Besides those large rivers, a great number of torrents pour down from the mountains, and, holding a course due west, fall into the Arabian Sea.\n\nOf the mountains, the most important are the Western Ghaute, which, running in a direction from south to north, constitute the eastern boundary of the territory from its southern limit, in lat. 20\u00b0, to lat. 21\u00b0 28', where, turning eastward, they form the lofty brow inclosing the valley of the Taptee on the south. The average elevation of these mountains is about 1,200 feet, though the height of some summits is probably not less than 2,000 feet. From the western face of the Ghautes proceed numerous spurs or ridges of inferior elevation, a few of them reaching to the sea; and in some parts they are replaced by isolated hills or rocks, such as those of Parnera, Rola, and several others, the elevation of which seldom exceeds 300 or 400 feet. North of the Taptee, the Satpoora range, dividing the valley of that river from the valley of the Nerbudda, extends for some distance into this territory, terminating to the westward near Rajpeepla. North of the valley of the Nerbudda, is the western extremity of the Windhya Mountains, expanding into the Barrea Hills, low and irregularly grouped; and still farther north, into those of Loonawara. Beyond these, in the same direction, are those of Dongurgpore, becoming ultimately united to Mount Aboo.\n\nThe overlying formation of the northern section of the Ghauts is volcanic, as is also that of the Satpoora range, and consists for the most part of trap. The trappean formation extends into the peninsula of Kattywar, where it forms the bold mountain of Palithana, celebrated for its numerous Jain temples. Farther westward, granite is met with, rising to an elevation of 2,500 feet, in the celebrated Girnar Mountain, \"an immense bare and isolated granite rock, presenting all the gigantic masses peculiar to that formation.\" The lower parts of the mountain, as well as the vicinity, are overlaid with soft limestone. The island of Perim, in the Gulf of Cambay, formed of sandstone, is remarkable for containing numerous organic remains.\n\n41\n\nJourn. As. Soc. Beng. 1838, p. 879 \u2014 Kittoe, Notes of a Journey to Girnar.\n\nId. 1836, pp. 288-291 \u2014 Fulljames, on Fossil Bones in Western India; also Lush, id. 767.\nGUZERAT.\n\nThe mineral wealth of this extensive tract is but scanty, and calls for little notice; the most important production is iron-ore, raised in the peninsula. The mouth of the Taptee, and probably the whole bed of the Gulf of Cambay, abounds in a black sand, very rich in iron, and containing some platina. At Rajpeepla, the finest cornelians are obtained in great abundance.\n\nIn the southern districts, the proximity of the sea, and the mountains covered with jungle or forests, moderate and equalize the temperature. The most disagreeable season is during the south-west monsoon, when the atmosphere, loaded with moisture, causes very distressing sensations and maladies, the effects being most severely felt during the night. In the inland districts, in the north of the territory, between the rivers Nerbudda and Saburmuttee, the average temperature is greater than in the southern districts. In this sultry tract, the hot winds blow from about the 20th of March to the 20th of May, and at this time the thermometer in a double-walled tent rises often to 115\u00b0, and in the house to 103\u00b0. Many, as well natives as Europeans, suffer from coup de soleil, and in parts where the soil is loose, the heat is rendered more annoying by the profusion of fine sand borne along by the wind. Throughout the district, the weather becomes cooler towards the end of October, and in the cold season hoar frosts are not uncommon. The climate of the peninsula, particularly in the Geer, is marked by insalubrity to such an extent as almost inevitably to cause death to those who are so rash as to expose themselves to it in the season following the autumnal monsoon. The shores of the Gulf of Cambay are also generally malarious. \"The constant exhalation of noxious effluvia throughout the year, from the extensive tracts of salt marsh, which, covered with profuse and rank vegetation within the limit of the tides, surround the head of the Gulf of Cambay, and project for many miles inland, must doubtless exert a pernicious influence on the atmosphere in its vicinity.\"\n\nThe zoology of Guzerat is varied and interesting. The lion is not uncommon, and equals in size and strength the same description of animal in Africa. It is observed to have a less mane; but this circumstance is considered to result from its frequenting the thick jungles instead of the open desert, the\nusual resort of his African fellow. Tigers and leopards are very numerous, and destructive of both men and cattle. There are also the wolf, hyena, antelope, and deer in great number and variety. The nylgau (Antilope picta) is common in the northern parts, where there are large herds of them. Of birds, there are the flamingo, argala or adjutant-bird, sarus or gigantic crane, and a great variety of aquatic birds. Of domestic animals, the principal are the camel, most common north of the Saburnuttee and in the plains in the vicinity of the deserts of Rajpootana. It is also met with in the western part of the peninsula. The buffalo is everywhere to be met, but in greater abundance and excellence in the south. Kine are numerous, but in the southern part are of inferior quality, while in the northern the breed is very fine, not being excelled by any in Britain; and the bullocks are so much esteemed for draught or burthen, that prices equal to 50l. or 60l. are not unfrequently given for a pair. The ass is small and weak; but in the wilds of the north-west, the wild ass is a creature of great speed, as well as of considerable beauty, and is sometimes tamed for purposes of show and pomp. The horse of Kattywar was formerly highly prized; but the breed has degenerated, and the Guzerat horse at present bred by the natives, is in no esteem, being small, weak, and ugly. In some of the jungly valleys and wilds, there is a breed of wild cattle, different from the bison, and far less fierce.\n\nThe soil of this extensive district is very varied: in the south there is much reddish and yellowish soil, formed from the disintegrated rocks, and in general fertile, being extremely favourable for the growth of both herbs and trees; but towards the mountains, there is a considerable extent of rocky ground, producing only grass or jungle. On the banks of the rivers, more particularly about their estuaries, the soil is generally deep, black, and very productive, especially of cotton. In the middle part of the country, between Baroda and Champaneer, is an uncommonly rich district, having in some places a deep, black, tenacious soil, in others a reddish brown, both very fertile. Forbes considers the fine tract in the vicinity of Baroda as far surpassing in beauty, fertility, and luxuriant vegetation, all the countries which he had ever seen. In the level but rather elevated tract about the upper part of the\nGUZERAT.\n\nSaburmuttee, the soil is of a deep-brown hue, in some places verging to a greyish tinge, very favourable for the growth of all sorts of produce, especially tobacco, castor-oil plants, maize, carrots, and opium-poppies. Towards the northern boundary, in the vicinity of the Runn or Great Salt Marsh, the soil is so light and sandy as to be not worth cultivation, and affords no return, except in the profits of grazing. The crops, alimentary as well as commercial, grown in this territory, are very important. Of the alimentary, rice is more or less common in all districts under the hills, and in the alluvial soil along the seacoast throughout the whole extent of the province. It is also much cultivated about the river Saburmuttee. Wheat is very extensively grown, especially in the northern part, and in the country between the Taptee and the Nerbudda. Barley thrives in many parts, jowar (Holcus sorghum), in the light lands in the north; bajra (Holcus spicatus) is cultivated on inferior lands throughout the whole territory, and is the staple article of food for the poorer classes of the people. In the peninsula of Kattywar, jowar and bajra are the chief alimentary crops, but wheat is also cultivated to considerable extent; as are kodra (Paspalum scorobiculatum) and gram (Cicer arisinum). Sugarcane flourishes in every part of the territory: it is one of the principal products in the south, and the quality is considered fine; but cotton may be regarded as the staple commercial crop. The date-palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and palmyra (Borassus flabelliformis) are extensively planted in the vicinity of the sea, on account of the sap, from which, when fermented, the ardent spirit toddy is drawn by distillation. The mhowa (Bassia latifolia) grows in great abundance, and its flowers are in great request, as the petals when dried afford a pleasant food, resembling raisins, and by distillation yield an ardent spirit, which, though nauseous to Europeans, is consumed largely by the lower classes of the native population. Mango-trees are in great abundance, and produce fine fruit. Towards the coast are many fine specimens of Adansonia, with its grotesque and huge stem, large white flower, enormous fruit, valuable to fishermen, for whom it serves as floats for their nets; while the wood is so light that a man often carries on his shoulder a large log of it, to be used as a raft in fishing, or in taking water-fowl. The pulp of the fruit\nGUZERAT.\n\nalso yields a pleasant acid, which is used in medicine and in making sherbet. The jak (Artocarpus integrifolia), with its huge fruit, the tamarind, and the Buchanania latifolia, yielding fruit resembling an almond in taste, abound in this well-wooded country. The great wonder, however, of the vegetable creation is the cubbeer-bur, or great banian-tree (Ficus indica), situate on an island in the Nerbudda, covering an area estimated at from three to four acres. So great is its height, that at a distance it resembles a hill, and so numerous, large, and close its branches, that in the season of inundation, the population dwell amidst them, until the subsidence of the river leaves their usual homes free from water. Esculent products are numerous and excellent, especially the water-melon, considered the best in India; but the plantain is not abundant, and the produce is of no great excellence.\n\nThe manufacturing industry for which this territory was formerly noted, has much decayed, and in general has nearly disappeared, from the greater cheapness of the wares thrown into the market by British competition.\n\nOf the population inhabiting these extensive dominions, there are no means of ascertaining the precise numbers. Nothing exists beyond mere estimates, and those estimates probably rest but on vague grounds. According to the best information available, the population may be considered as something less than 3,000,000. They are of various lineage and characters, but no census having been made, the comparative numbers of the respective castes, classes, and tribes, could be assigned only conjecturally. Though the Mahrattas are the ruling race, they appear to be surpassed in number by other tribes, especially in the peninsula. The Rajpoots are very numerous; Brahmins abound, and are mostly landed proprietors or village officers. Mussulmans are to be found principally in the towns, and the Bora sectarians of that faith are in general industrious, wealthy, and influential members of society. The Parsees, though a few are engaged in agriculture, in general resort to the larger towns, where they are distinguished by their industry, quiet demeanor, and commercial sagacity. Coolies, a race settled here from remote antiquity, are especially numerous in the districts north of the river Myhee, and of the tracts about the upper parts of the various rivers in the north. Along\n\n---\n\n4 Forbes, Oriental Mem. i. 395, 478; ii. 106, 209, 271. Transact. of Lit. Soc. of Bombay, i. 289\u2014Copland, Account of Cor-nelian Mines.\nthe north-west frontier of the territory, they constitute the bulk of the population. They are in general a robust race, and, though professing the Brahminical faith, eat flesh, particularly that of the buffalo, and are much addicted to intoxication, as well by opium and bhang, as by ardent spirits. Many of them are depredators of various classes, some secret plunderers, others highway robbers; yet they are said to be trustworthy when expressly hired, either as guards of property, or to convey money to some destined place. The Koonbies are an agricultural tribe, who exist in great numbers in the south and midland parts of the territory, but to a less extent in the north. Besides those just enumerated, are some anomalous tribes of less importance; such as Dunjas, a small, well-knit, active race, engaged to some extent in cultivation, but by choice deriving their subsistence as far as practicable from the chase, fishing, or the collecting of wild fruits and the marketable produce of the jungles for sale. Their peculiar pursuits, little relished or shared in by the rest of the community, cause them to be viewed with dislike and dread; and the reputation of possessing great power in sorcery subjects them to much cruel treatment. Sometimes, in the true spirit of native barbarity, they are punished for such imputed delinquency by having their noses cut off, or by other mutilations. The Katties, who at a rather remote period emigrated from the banks of the Indus to the peninsula, form a majority of the inhabitants in a considerable prant or district to which they have given their name. They are considered to have been originally from Central Asia, and their northern origin is believed to be evidenced by their fair hair and complexions, blue eyes, tall stature, and athletic frame.\n\nOver the population in general, but especially over the Rajpoots, two classes of men, Bhats and Charuns, exercise wonderful influence. The Charuns, who, as well as the Bhats, boast of celestial origin, are divided into two tribes,\u2014the Machilee being merchants, and the Maroo bards; and these two have in the aggregate 120 subdivisions. The men of those numerous subdivisions profess to understand the rites and observances which propitiate Siva and his consort Parvati, the favourite deities of the Rajpoots; and as few of the population except these pretenders to sanctity can read or write, they add to their other means of influence acquaintance with the genealogies of\nGUZERAT.\n\nchiefs and tribes, and with laudatory legends, which they chant in their honour. It is represented, that amongst the Rajpoots there is a deep impression that certain destruction results from being instrumental in shedding the blood of a Charun, or of any member of his family. In reference to this impression, one of the class intent on attaining an object which he cannot otherwise bring about, will not scruple to murder a relative; and instances have not been wanting in which, in extreme cases, a Charun has destroyed himself. The aged7 and the young among the Charuns are taught, not merely to be ready to part with life whenever the honour of their family or the class to which they belong calls for the sacrifice, but it is said that, \"from the feeble female of four-score, to the child of five years of age, they are eager to be the first to die;\" and this, it is added, \"is no rare feeling, but one which appears to belong to every individual of this singular community.\" Under influence, acquired from the dread of the consequences of urging the Charun to such frightful extremities, the members of this community guarantee the performance8 of contracts entered into by the most faithless freebooters, and also become security for the payment of sums sometimes of very large amount. They also attend travellers as safeguards, and hesitate not to inflict on themselves wounds, or even death, should they fail in insuring protection to those whom they escort. Their influence, however, on such points has latterly been on the wane; probably because it has become less requisite since the establishment of greater security9 to life and property, by the advance of British power and influence in the dominions of the Guicowar.\n\nThe Bhats, according to the imperfect information which we have concerning them, appear to differ little from the Charuns, except that they have less influence and fame. The portion of either which they possess results from their officiating as chroniclers, bards, flatterers, or lampooners. \"They give1 praise and fame in their songs to those who are liberal to them, while they visit those who neglect or injure them, with satires, in which they usually reproach them with spurious birth and inherent meanness. Sometimes the Bhat, if very seriously offended, fixes the figure of the person he desires to degrade on a long pole, and appends to it a slipper, as a mark of disgrace. In such case the song of the Bhat records the infamy of the\n\n---\n\n7 Malcolm, ii. 137.\n8 Transacts. of Lit.

This image usually travels the country, till the party or his friends purchase the cessation of the ridicule and curses thus entailed.\" Those singular religionists, the Jains, are rather numerous, especially in the peninsula, where there is scarcely a village\\(^2\\) of any size which has not several of their families; and their innumerable beautiful temples, shrines, and monastic establishments on the mountains of Geernar and Palithana, are amongst the most interesting architectural works in India. The Bheel tribe exist in considerable numbers in the wilder tracts of the eastern and northeastern part of the territory, especially about the river Myhee. They are considered a people\\(^8\\) of remote origin, and formerly possessed of power, and of a considerable degree of civilization, until subjugated and oppressed by both Rajpoots and Mussulmans. At present some of them have settled into habits of fixed residence, and are engaged in agriculture; thus being raised above the savage state of the majority of their fellows.\n\nThroughout the more civilized parts of Guzerat, the population is rather comfortably lodged, in earthen or brick houses, with tiled roofs; but in the jungly tracts the houses are made of mud, with grass roofs. The food of the population is also in general plentiful, consisting of rice, wheat, and other grains, pulse and cucurbitaceous products, fruits, and milk; to which such of the upper classes as are not restricted by any scruples, add flesh, especially that of sheep and buffaloes, as well as fish, which may be obtained in abundance from the numerous streams and tanks.\n\nHereditary slavery is not uncommon in parts of Guzerat; and those claiming ownership over the unfortunate beings reduced to this state, not only avail themselves of the advantage of their services, but hire them out to others. In deference to the philanthropic views of the British government, the Guicowar has lately, indeed, issued a proclamation, prohibiting, under penalties, the future sale or purchase of children within his dominions, except under express permission of the durbar. This, however, is a very imperfect and unsatisfactory measure, perhaps a merely colourable one; and the home authorities have justly expressed regret that the prohibition was not made absolute.\n\nThe vernacular language, denominated Guzerattee, is an\nGUZERAT.\n\noffset from the great Sanskritic stock, and closely resembles the Hindee.\n\nThe principal towns\u2014Baroda the capital, Pahlunpore, Cambay, Radhunpore, Chowrar, Baunsda, Peint, Hursool, Dhurrumpore, Thurraud, Sucheen, Wusravee, Deesa, Rajkote, Poorbunder, Dwarka, Loonawarra, Barreah, Daunta, Dongurpore, Banswarra, Jabbooa, Oodepore, Rajpeepla, Saunte, and Beyt\u2014are noticed under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThere are scarcely any made roads in this territory; but most parts of the country are very level, so that communication for half the year is easy, and wheeled carriages traverse it in all directions. The principal lines of route are\u20141. From south-east to north-west, from Mhow, through Deesa, to Jesulmere. 2. From east to west, from Mhow, through Baroda, and thence through Limree, across the peninsula, to the south coast of the Gulf of Cutch, at Jooria. 3. From south-east to north-west, from Baroda to Ahmedabad, and thence across the Runn to Hyderabad, in Scinde. 4. From south to north, from Surat, through Baroda, to Beerpoor, where the route is joined with that already noticed, running from Mhow to Deesa. 5. From the north-east to the south-west of the peninsula, from Bujana, through Rajkot, to Poorbunder. A railway is projected from Baroda to Tunkaria: the line has been surveyed, and a favourable report as to its practicability been given. Such a work would be a source of great benefit to the country; and there can be little doubt that it will be effected at no distant period.\n\nThe early history of Guzerat presents no features of greater interest than those which usually occur in the records of the eastern nations of the like periods. It formed part of the Mahomedan empire of Delhi; but in the reign of Mahmood Toghluk, was separated from it by Mozuffer Khan, previously governor, but thenceforward king. About the year 1572 it was the seat of great confusion, and was re-annexed to the empire by Akbar. When the Mahratta fortune prevailed, the chief officer of the confederacy, the Peishwa, secured a large amount of tribute from it; while another chief, called the Guicowar, became the ruler of the principal state in Guzerat,\n\n---\n\n4 Elphinstone, Hist. of India, ed. 1849, pp. 350, 444, 445, 678-683.\nGWALIOR.\n\ncalled Baroda, to the article on which the reader is referred for information on its history.\n\nGUZZLEHUTTY.\u2014See Gujelhatti.\n\nGWALIOR TERRITORIES,\u00b9 the possessions of the family of Scindia, have a singularly irregular outline, and consist of several detached districts, the principal of which is bounded on the north-east by the Chumbul, dividing it from the British districts of Agra and Etawah; on the east, in a very tortuous direction, by Bundelcund and the British districts of Saugor and Nerbudda; on the south by the native states of Bhopal and Dhar; on the west by those of Rajgurh, Jhalawur, and Kotah; and on the north-west by the Chumbul, separating it from Dholpore and Rajpootana. The extreme points of the Gwalior territory are in lat. 21\u00b0 8'\u201426\u00b0 50', long. 74\u00b0 45'\u201479\u00b0 21'. The length of the principal portion above described is 246 miles from north to south, and 170 in breadth. The area of the whole comprises 33,119 square miles,\u00b2 and comprehends part of the ancient province of Agra, most of Malwa, and part of the Deccan. The extreme north-eastern part adjoining Agra is generally level, bare, of no great fertility,\u00b3 and much cut up by deep precipitous ravines in the vicinity of the streams. A little further south, in the vicinity of the town of Gwalior, and about lat. 26\u00b0 20', the surface rises into hills, which on the east approach those of Bundelcund;\u2074 on the south the great Vindhya range, and on the west the hilly country\u2075 of Rajpootana. The \"country,\u2076 as far as the eye can range, is dotted over with small hills, which, unconnected by any chain of heights, start abruptly and independently out of the level plain.\" On one of these is the celebrated fortress of Gwalior. The geological formation of those rocky eminences is a very fine-grained sandstone, disposed in horizontal strata, and yielding an excellent building-stone,\u2077 for which purpose it may be had in slabs of great length and breadth. The middle part, comprising a considerable portion of Malwa, is a plateau, having probably an average elevation of about 1,500 feet, though there are some points rising greatly above that amount, as in the instance of Shaizgurh, in the Mandoo range, which is 2,628 feet\u2078 above the sea. The general slope of the plateau is very gentle from the Mandoo range towards the north or north-east, as indicated by the course of a number of streams.\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.\n\u00b2 Trigon.

The Mandoo range, which, running east and west, forms the southern boundary of the plateau, and slopes very gently northwards towards it, dips precipitously southwards towards the Nerbudda, and a narrow strip of Scindia's territory stretches across the valley of that river, and even to the south of the river Taptee. The rock underlying the diluvial or vegetable strata in Malwa, according to Dangerfield, \"appears to constitute the northern termination of a very extensive secondary trap formation, which extends from the extremity of the Deccan, and probably even Mysore.\" The upper or northern part of Malwa is chiefly occupied by sandstone and sandstone-slates, on which in some places repose low ranges of hills, consisting generally of hornstone. Iron-ore abounds, especially in the hills on the frontiers; and east of the river Chumbul is a narrow bed of cellular clay iron-ore, extending from southeast to north-west about eighty miles. Dangerfield states that \"the ore is poor in metal, and is not worked.\" No decisive indications either of other metal or of coal appear to have been found in the territory. The diluvial or vegetable soil in the Malwa portion of the country varies from three to ten feet in depth, and in a few places is as much as twelve or fifteen feet. \"It is either a red ferruginous, or a rich black loam; the former compact, the latter light, with deep cracks or fissures in every direction.\" Having great natural fertility, and ample and ready means of artificial irrigation, few parts of India enjoy greater natural advantages than this part of Scindia's territory.\n\nThe rivers of the Gwalior country are numerous. The Taptee, flowing west, traverses the most southern part of the territory; and parallel to this, but about forty miles farther north, the Nerbudda flows in a similar direction: but by far the greater portion of the drainage of the territory is discharged into the river Chumbul, which, receiving the waters of the Chumbla, Seepra, Chota Kallee Sind, Newuj, Parbutty, and some others of less importance, flows along the north-west frontier of the country, separating it from the Jeypoor, Kerowly, and Dhlopore territories; subsequently\nturning south-east, it forms the north-eastern boundary, towards the British districts of Agra and Etawa, and joins the Jumna in the latter district, twenty miles distant from the north-eastern course of the Gwalior territory. The Sinde, a considerable river, but less than the Chumbul, flows in some measure parallel to it, but farther to the east, and after forming for a considerable extent the south-eastern boundary towards Bundelcund, intersects for thirty miles the north-eastern corner of Gwalior, and finally falls into the Jumna a short distance below the confluence of the Chumbul with that river. In the northern part of the territory, forming a tract extending between the Chumbul and the Sinde, rise the Kooaree, Asun, Sank, and some other torrents of less importance, which, flowing east or north-east, fall into the Sinde on the left side. This northern part, though not remarkable for natural fertility, is probably not inferior in this respect to the contiguous parts of Dholpore and of the British district of Agra, which, by means of artificial irrigation and other skilful processes of culture, are rendered very productive. In the Gwalior territory, on the contrary, the soil has been everywhere stripped of trees for the purposes of the ordnance. In consequence of the oppression exercised by the ruling powers, and the licentiousness and rapacity of the soldiery, \"there is nothing left upon the land of animal or vegetable life to animate or enrich it; nothing of stock but what is necessary to draw from the soil an annual crop, and which looks to one harvest for its entire return. The sovereign proprietor of the soil lets it out by the year in farms or villages, to men who depend entirely upon the year's return for the means of payment. He in his turn lets the lands in detail to those who till them, and who depend for their subsistence and for the means of paying their rents upon the returns of the single harvest. There is no manufacture anywhere to be seen, save of brass pots and rude cooking-utensils; no trade or commerce, save in the transport of the rude produce of the land to the great camp at Gwalior, upon the backs of bullocks, for want of roads fit for wheeled carriages. No one resides in the villages save those whose labour is indispensably necessary to the rudest tillage, and those who collect the dues of government, and are paid upon the lowest possible scale.\" The writer here quoted, and who was British\npolitical resident at the court of Scindia, adds\u2014\"Such is the state of the Gwalior territories in every part of India where I have seen them.\" Perhaps, however, the situation of affairs is somewhat better in the south-western portion of the territory, or that comprising part of Malwa, as there is produced a great quantity of the fine opium for which the country is celebrated, besides wheat, gram (Cicer arietinum), pulse of various kinds, jowar (Holcus sorghum), bajra (Holcus spicatus), mung (Phaseolus mungo), maize, rice, linseed, and other oil-seeds, garlic, turmeric, ginger, sugar-cane, indigo, aal (Morinda multiflora), yielding a fine red dye. The vicinity of Bhilsa is famed for producing the finest tobacco, though in no great quantity. There is much cotton grown; but Chandhairee, noted for fine fabrics of this article, is stated to have been supplied with the raw material from Berar.\n\nArts and manufactures are few and depressed. The cotton fabrics of Chandhairee, which were very considerable before those of Britain were brought into competition with them, are now, from this cause, in little demand. At Boorhaunpoor are manufactures of fine cottons, silks, and kamkhab or brocade, very rich and beautiful. The raising and reducing of iron-ore is practised in many places. Brass guns are cast in the maharajah's arsenal at the fort of Gwalior; but neither the material nor workmanship is good. Petty handicrafts, necessary for supplying the simple wants of the population, are everywhere practised in the towns and villages.\n\nThe imports are of scanty amount, and consist principally of British woollens, cottons, silks, cutlery, Cashmere shawls, pearls from the Persian Gulf, Ceylon diamonds, and agates from Bundelcund; gold, silver, mercury, copper, lead, and zinc. The muskets used by the army are of French make, and a considerable quantity of French bijouterie finds a sale among the higher orders. Opium is the principal export, and is sent abroad by way of Bombay. Cotton is also largely exported to Bombay, and to the towns on the Jumna and Ganges. The tobacco of Bhilsa has been mentioned as of fine quality: a portion of this, though the entire production is small, is exported. The other exports of any moment are dye-stuffs and iron.\n\nThe northern part of the country, of moderate elevation, and\nGWALIOR.\n\nin most places either rocky or sandy, has a climate partaking of\nthe torrid character of the neighbouring tracts of Agra or\nRajpootana. In these parts the climate, during the rainy sea-\nson, and for a short time afterwards, is exceedingly unhealthy,\nfevers being then very rife, in consequence, according to an\nintelligent writer, of the moisture imbibed by the superficial\ndiluvial soil being prevented from passing off by an imper-\nmeable substratum of sandstone. Hence results great damp,\nindicated by mouldiness on all substances susceptible of it.\nDuring the dry and hot seasons, the climate is not unhealthy.\nThe middle, the southern, and the western parts, or those com-\nprised within Malwa, with little exception, have a mild and\nrather equable climate, resulting from the elevation of the\nsurface. The range of the thermometer is unusually small,\nexcept during the latter part of the year, when great and\nsudden changes often take place. The cool season comprises\nthe period between the beginning of November and the end of\nFebruary; the hot season succeeds, and continues to the middle\nof June, when the periodical rains set in, and last to the close\nof September, the average fall being about fifty inches. During\nthis season the thermometer has a very moderate range, rarely\nmore than from 72\u00b0 to 78\u00b0. The climate becomes cooler after\nthe rains, and in proportion to the approach towards the winter\nsolstice, when the coldest weather commences, and continues\nthrough January and the early part of February, the thermo-\nmeter sometimes falling three or four degrees below the freez-\ning point. During the sultry season the hot winds are com-\nparatively mild and of short duration, though the thermometer\nsometimes rises to nearly 100\u00b0 during the day; but the nights\nare invariably cool and refreshing. According to Malcolm, \u201cthough during the two months immediately succeeding the\nrainy season (when the hilly and woody parts should be\nshunned) fevers prevail here, as in other parts of India, yet the\nclimate must on the whole be considered as salubrious, and to\nthose enervated by a long residence in the lower and warmer\nplains of India, pleasant and invigorating.\u201d He adds, however,\nthat cholera always is endemic in this province. A medical\nauthority, already quoted, gives a less favourable description\nof the climate of the southern division; stating that the rains\nare sometimes so redundant about the time of the winter\nGWALIOR.\n\nsolstice as to rot the crops; that malaria prevails in a greater or less degree, according to situation; and that from October to December the jungly tracts cannot be traversed without peril to life. \"Both the hot season and the cold are often liable to very fatal epidemics. As a general rule, it may be remarked, that the nearer we approach the southern border and the Ner-budda, the greater is the fatality of epidemics when they appear.\" The most prevalent diseases are fevers, constant and intermittent; and those contracted in the jungles at the close of the year are almost universally fatal. The virulent cholera sets in annually with dreadful intensity, causing death in less than an hour after the commencement of the attack. The average duration of human life is extraordinarily short, so that it is quite rare to meet a person of very advanced age; and so great, it is stated, is the mortality among children, that not more than one out of five is reared. Hence, as well as from other causes, the population is very disproportionate to the productive capability of the country.\n\nThe wild animals enumerated are, the tiger, leopard, bear, wolf, hy\u00e6na, wild dog, jackal, fox, ounce, lynx, badger, ichneumon, civet, otter, rat, bat, mouse, wild hog, nylgau or white-footed antelope, and various other kinds; deer of several species, the wild buffalo, the ape7 and the monkey, the squirrel, the porcupine, and the hare. Of birds, there are the vulture, eagle, hawks of various kinds, the kite, the buzzard, the owl, the hornbill (Buceros), the raven, the crow, daws and pies, the parrot, the jay, the cuckoo, humming-birds, the wild goose, the wild duck, the pelican, the cormorant, the spoonbill, the stork, the crane, the heron, the adjutant, the curlew, the snipe, the bustard, the floriken, the peafowl, the pheasant, the partridge, the quail, the pigeon, the dove, and the sparrow. The rivers abound in fish,8 especially of the carp kind. The most remarkable of the snake race are the boa, water-snake, cobra, black spotted snake, spectacled snake, yellow clouded snake, whip-snake, and leaping snake. The magar or round blunt-snouted crocodile infests some of the rivers.*\n\nThe population of the north-eastern part of this territory is\n\n* In the Bengal and Agra Guide, 1842,1 a scientific list of above 130 botanical productions of this tract is furnished; but the necessary limits of this work preclude further notice of it.\n\n1 Ut supra, 397-399.\nof a mixed kind, comprising, besides Mahrattas (the ruling order), Boondelas, Jauts, Rajpoots, with some less distinctly defined divisions of Hindoos, and Mussulmans. Until the Mahratta inroads in the last century, the country was from an early period a possession of the Mahomedan rulers of Delhi; and in no part of the territory, except the small tract south of the Nerbudda, do the Mahrattas form any large proportion of the people. In the greater part of the southern and southwestern parts, comprising a portion of Malwa, a very considerable section of the population is Brahminical; and Malcolm remarks: \"There is perhaps no part of India where the tribes of Brahmans are so various, and their numbers so great.\" He, however, adds, \"but there is certainly none where there are so few of them either wealthy, learned, or where there is less attention paid to the religious rites of the Hindoo faith, or to its priests, by the rest of the population.\" Rajpoots exist in large numbers, and pay little regard to the Brahmans, whose place as to moral and religious influence is supplied by the cognate tribes of Bhats and Charuns. There are many petty Rajpoot rajahs, who yield ostensibly fealty and tribute to the family of Scindia, but display from time to time evidence of a refractory disposition, which would render them perilous subordinates in case of any reverse happening to the paramount power. They are described by Malcolm as an indolent, sensual race, living habitually under the besotting influence of opium; while the atrocious practices of infanticide and suttee find toleration. The Mussulman population is estimated at about a twentieth of the whole. The relative density of the population assumed by Malcolm for Central India is ninety-eight to the square mile; and this ratio, compared with the area, would make the amount 3,228,512.\n\nThere are probably no places of public instruction in this territory; but private schools, both in the towns and villages, are very numerous. At some of the principal towns Persian is taught, as a qualification to act as moonshees, and perform\n\n* In a periodical work published some years ago, the relative density of population in Central India was set down at 283 to the square mile; but there can be no reasonable doubt that this is a great exaggeration. In a more recent work, a calculation giving to Scindia's territories a population of 168 to the square mile is quoted, and justly condemned as excessive.\nGWALIOR.\n\nsimilar official duties. Sanscrit is taught at Oojin and a few other towns. In the vicinity of Gwalior, Mahratta is the language spoken; in the southern and the western part of the territory, the common language is the Hindee. The general course of study comprises reading, writing, account-keeping, mythology and ritual lore, astronomy according to the Ptolemaic system, and astrology. The cultivation of the Mahratta language appears to be rather limited, in consequence of the small numerical proportion which the ruling race bears to the great mass of the population.\n\nThe sources of revenue are\u20141. Mal,* including what is collected on land and customs, the latter comprising taxes on spirits, and other charges of a similar nature; and, 2. Abwab,\u2020 which \"includes the difference of the exchange between that of the market and the fixed rate at which the revenue of the district is paid; casual aid or support of government officers employed by the minister or manager; fees to the potdar or treasury servant, who examines the money; contributions to expenses at the feasts and marriages of the princes or principal ministers.\" There is another class, denominated extraordinary taxes, comprehending a house-tax, or an income-tax, levied every second or third year, principally on the trading part of the community; besides fines, impositions, and temporary supplies. Malcolm considers the amount of taxation moderate, but the mode of collecting it objectionable, principally on the score of inequality and uncertainty. The total revenue of Scindia's territory is stated by Malcolm7 to have been 1,27,68,459 rupees in 1819, and 1,43,20,227 in 1824. According to Colonel Sleeman, late British political resident at Gwalior, it appears, that \"in the year 1833, the Gwalior territory yielded a net revenue to the treasury of ninety-two lacs of rupees (92,00,000), after disbursing all the local costs of the civil and fiscal administration of the different districts, in officers, establishments, charitable institutions, military fiefs;\" and adds that, in the districts near the capital, the net revenue is about five-sixths of the gross collection, but that in the\n\n* Mal, \"rent.\"\n\u2020 Abwab: Wilkins states,1 \"This term is particularly used to distinguish the taxes imposed subsequently to the establishment of the Assul, or original standard rent.\"\n\n1 In v. in Glossary accompanying Appendix to Report of Select Com. of House of Lords, 1830.\nremoter parts, where government is weaker, population thinner, and predatory outrage more prevalent, the net revenue is about one-third the whole collection. He says, \"These collections are equal to the whole annual rent of the land; for every man by whom the land is held or cultivated is a mere tenant at will, liable every season to be turned out, to give place to any other man that may offer more for the holding.\" At present, the revenue is stated to amount to sixty lacs of rupees, exclusive of eighteen lacs assigned to the British government for the payment of the military contingent. Of the 29,606 men which, in 1824, formed the military force of Scindia, 9,471 were horse; showing a relative diminution in that force subsequently to 1817, when the army consisted \"of about 26,000 regular infantry, 18,000 cavalry, and 396 pieces of cannon,\" besides a large body of Pindarries, over whom Scindia had control, if not command, some local corps, and the garrisons and guns of his fortresses. In 1833, according to Sleeman, the regular army at Gwalior camp comprised thirty regiments of infantry, each having 600 men and four field-pieces; the artillery consisted of 200 guns, of different calibre; there were but few corps of cavalry, and those were not considered very efficient. In 1848, at the time of the military operations against the troops of Scindia at Gwalior, the number of infantry was estimated at 18,689, the number of guns was 215. Respecting the efficiency of this last arm, the commander-in-chief of the British forces remarked, \"I may safely assert that I never witnessed guns better served, nor a body of infantry apparently more devoted to the protection of their regimental guns, held by the Mahratta corps as objects of worship.\" At an earlier period, the severe loss suffered by the British at Assye and Laswaree was mainly from the fire of the enemies' artillery. The present military force consists, first, of the contingent, paid by the British government from funds derived from territorial assignments, and numbering 8,400, forty-five of whom are European officers, selected from the Bengal army; and, secondly, of the troops maintained by the Gwalior government, and at its disposal, amounting (cavalry, infantry, and artillery) to upwards of 9,622; thus rather exceeding the maximum fixed by the treaty of 1844, which (exclusively of the contingent) was 9,000.\nGWALIOR.\n\nThe founder of the Scindia dynasty was Ranojee Scindia, a Soodra, of the Koombi or cultivator tribe,* and hereditary potal or headman of a small rural district. He appears to have first come into notice as a domestic of Balaji Wiswanath, who was Peishwa from 1714 to 1720. Ranojee Scindia, being considered by his master trustworthy in his humble avocation, was advanced to a station in the body-guard; subsequently rising rapidly, he became a chief of considerable importance, and on his death, about 1750, was succeeded in his position, as head of the Scindia family, by Madhaji Scindia, one of his natural sons, who was present at the great battle of Paniput, in 1761, in which Ahmed Shah Dooranee defeated the confederated Mahrattas. Madhaji escaped the carnage with difficulty, and not without a desperate wound, which rendered him lame for life. This great national disaster of the Mahrattas did not, however, operate unfavourably for Scindia; for the shock given to the power of the Peishwa actually removed a principal obstacle out of his way. He recovered some possessions in Malwa, which had been wrested from him after the battle of Paniput, levied contributions very extensively, enforced tribute from the chiefs of Rajpootana and others in the vicinity of his dominions, and maintained a large and effective force in the Deccan, to control the Peishwa and other parties opposed to the growth of his power. He seems to have first come into serious collision with the British forces in 1779, when, in concert with the troops of the Peishwa and of Holkar, he baffled the Bombay army in an attempt to march to Poona, and subsequently, in a convention with the managers of the expedition, exacted a cession of a portion of Broach. The growth of Scindia\u2019s power up to this period is thus described by Malcolm:\u2014\u201cMadhaji Scindia took full advantage of the dissensions that occurred at Poona, after the death of Ballajee (1761), to usurp, as far as he could, the rights and lands of the head of the empire to the north of the Nerbudda. The detail of the progress of this system of spoliation of both friend and foe, is not necessary; suffice it to say, this able chief was the principal opposer of the English in the war they carried on in favour of Ragobah. He was the nominal slave, but the rigid master, of the unfortunate Shah Allum, emperor\n\n* According to Duff, he claimed a Rajpoot lineage.\nGWALIOR.\n\nof Delhi; the pretended friend, but the designing rival, of the house of Holkar; the professed inferior in all matters of form, but the real superior and oppressor, of the Rajpoot princes of Central India, and the proclaimed soldier, but the actual plunderer, of the family of the Peishwa.\" His extensive possessions in Malwa, however, formed the main basis of his power. Mohammed, the weak emperor of Delhi, having, in 1741, granted the province of Malwa in jaghire to the Peishwa, who intrusted its management to Ranojee Scindia, that chief, and subsequently, still more effectually, Madhaji, succeeded, by constantly-repeated encroachments, in acquiring complete dominion over the greater part of the province. Madhaji Scindia having succeeded in making himself master of the strong hill-fort of Gwalior, about 1779, lost it in 1780, when it was surprised in a night attack by a British force under Major Popham,* assisted by Captain Bruce. In the following year, Colonel Camac, in command of a British force, having invaded Malwa, and penetrated as far as Seronje, was so beset by Madhaji Scindia, as to be compelled to make a precipitate retreat, in the course of which, however, he succeeded in surprising and defeating his pursuer. Consequent on this defeat, a treaty was concluded, by which the British authorities agreed to evacuate all the territory claimed by Madhaji Scindia to the right of the Junna, he also engaging to leave the rans of Gohud in unmolested possession of Gwalior and of the adjoining country. By the treaty of Salbye, concluded between the East-India Company and the Peishwa, in 1782, Madhaji Scindia was recognised as a sovereign prince, and declared the guarantee of its conditions. The fort of Gwalior was, in 1784, invested by him, at the head of 70,000 men, and ultimately fell into his hands by surrender. In the succeeding year he entered Delhi, and was, by Shah Allum, made minister, but soon after expelled by a hostile confederacy. In 1788, however, he vigorously pushed his fortune, and, among other successes, acquired Agra. His most formidable force at this time was that commanded by De Boigne, a Savoyard by birth, but trained in the Irish brigade in the service of the king of France.\n\n* Such is the statement in the account of the enterprise written by Jonathan Scott, Persian interpreter to Popham, and present then on the spot. Prinsep states that Popham was encamped twenty-eight miles off.\nGWALIOR.\n\nThis able soldier, by means of funds supplied by Scindia, kept on foot an army\\(^5\\) of 18,000 regular, and 6,000 irregular infantry, 2,000 irregular horse, and 600 Persian cavalry, with 200 cannon. By these means, in 1790, were gained, within a few weeks of each other, the battle\\(^6\\) of Patun, and that of Mairta, in Joudpore, by which its rajah was effectually humbled. Delhi, and its immediate dependencies, had, in 1788, been occupied by Scindia, who expelled and punished with tortures, ending in death, Ghulam Kadir, the brutal oppressor and mutilator of Shah Allum. Madhaji Scindia at the same time maintained a preponderance\\(^7\\) at the court of the Peishwa at Poona, and at the time of his death, in 1794,\\(^8\\) his dominions extended from the river Taptee south, to the northern limit of the district of Delhi, and from the Gulf of Cambay on the west, to the Ganges in the east; including Candeish, a portion of the Deccan, the greatest part of Malwa, the districts of Agra and Delhi, and the central and finest part of the Doab. He was succeeded in his possessions by his grand-nephew Dowlut Rao Scindia, then in the fifteenth\\(^9\\) year of his age. The early years and efforts of Dowlut Rao were expended principally in contests at Poona and its vicinity, for obtaining influence over the Peishwa, or the means for overpowering him, with the view of wielding the power derived from his ostensible protection and countenance, thus playing a chief part in \u201ca scene\\(^1\\) of intrigue, art, and treachery, which is perhaps unparalleled.\u201d Dowlut Rao, joining his forces with those of Ragoji Bhonsla, rajah of Berar, the allied chiefs, in 1803, invaded the territory of the Nizam, protected by the East-India Company, and on the 23rd of September in that year, the Mahratta army, unskilfully encamped, was surprised at Assye by a British force of about an eighth of its number, commanded by General Sir Arthur Wellesley, subsequently the illustrious duke of Wellington, and, after a prolonged and fiercely-contested battle, was totally defeated.\\(^2\\) The overthrow of Scindia\u2019s military resources in the Deccan was completed by the defeat which the confederated Mahrattas received from Sir Arthur Wellesley at Argaum,\\(^3\\) in Berar, on the 28th of November following.\n\nThe destruction of the Mahratta power in Hindoostan north of the Nerbudda had, in the mean time, been not less signally effected by General, afterwards Lord Lake, the British com-\n\n---\n\n\\(^5\\) Duff, iii. 74.\n\n\\(^6\\) Id. iii. 73, 75.\n\n\\(^7\\) Id. iii. 75-86.\n\n\\(^8\\) Id. iii. 86.\n\n\\(^9\\) Id. iii. 9.\n\n\\(^1\\) Malcom, i. 184.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bengal Papers relative to the Mahratta War in 1803, p. 290.\n\nThorn, Mem. of War in India, 374.\n\nDuff, iii. 240.\n\n\\(^3\\) Bengal Papers, 294, 295.\n\nThornton, iii. 347-349.\n\nThorn, 301.\n\nDuff, iii. 362.\nmander-in-chief, who having, in the beginning of September, 1803, stormed Allygurh, a few days afterwards, at Patperganj, on the left bank of the Jumna, nearly opposite Delhi, totally defeated Scindia\u2019s disciplined army, commanded by the Frenchman Bourquien, and effectually cleared the Doab of the Mahrattas. Delhi was immediately occupied by the victorious army, to which, before the close of the same year, Agra yielded, after a brief attempt at defence. General Lake, indefatigably following up his advantages, destroyed at Laswaree, a few weeks afterwards, the remnant of Scindia\u2019s disciplined force.\n\nTo avert impending ruin, Doulut Rao, at the close of the year 1803, acceded to the treaty of Serji Anjengaum, dictated by the British government, ceding on the left bank of the Jumna \u201call his forts, territories, and rights in the Doab;\u201d and on the right bank of the river, \u201call his forts, territories, rights, and interests in the countries which are to the northward of those of the rajahs of Jeypore and Jodepore;\u201d or, substantially, all tracts which, eastward of long. 76\u00b0, are situate north of the Chumbul. Ambajee, a feudatory of Doulut Rao, had at his ostensible instance engaged to yield to the British the fort of Gwalior; but it was found necessary to commence military operations against the place, and the Mahratta garrison, rendered tractable by this measure, consented to receive a bribe, and depart. The fort was by the British government transferred to the rana of Gohud; but some difficulties arising, the grant was revoked, and the place, \u201cfrom considerations of friendship\u201d\u2014such was the phrase\u2014was in 1805 ceded to Doulut Rao Scindia by the second article of the treaty of Mustafapore. The Mahratta prince so highly appreciated the advantages resulting from the strength of the place, that he regarded it as his capital, and fixed his residence in a permanent camp at the base of the rock. In 1817, when the Peishwa confederated with Appa Sahib Bhonsla of Nagpore, and Holkar, for the overthrow of the British power, the marquis of Hastings, governor-general, took the command of a formidable army, and advancing to the river Chumbul, so far overawed Scindia that on November 5th, 1817, a treaty was executed, binding this chief, among other conditions, to concur with the British in effectually quelling the Pindarries and other freebooters, and for this purpose to furnish a body of 5,000 horse, to act\nGWALIOR.\n\nunder the control of British officers. Doulut Rao Scindia died in 1827, and as he had no male issue, Mugut Rao, a boy eleven years old, and nearest relation of the late maha-rajah who could from his age be adopted, was declared sovereign by the name of Ali Jah Junkojee Scindia. This youth displayed a trait of character of no common atrocity on occasion of his marriage, when he discharged arrows among the assembled people, one of whom was killed. He died childless in 1843, when Bhagerut Rao, his nearest male relative, eight years of age, was declared successor, and proclaimed under the title of Ali Jah Jyajee Scindia. The maternal uncle of the deceased maha-rajah became regent, under the title of the Mama Sahib, but was quickly displaced by court intrigue and military violence, and the reins of government were thrown ostensibly into the hands of the maha-ranee, widow of the late maha-rajah, \"a passionate girl of twelve years of age.\" Her ignorance, caprice, and froward petulance accelerated the progress of anarchy inevitable in such a juncture, and the more alarming, as the most active promoters of the turmoil were numerous and determined, well trained to arms, amply equipped with them, and actuated by a Mahratta love of violence and spoil. This state of things naturally and justly excited the apprehension of the government of British India, Scindia's dominions being extensively conterminous with those of the East-India Company, and likely, in case of outbreak, to share in the calamities and suffer from the deeds of rapine and blood sure to be perpetrated by a lawless soldiery, associated with freebooters more lawless than themselves. The actual minister was the Dada Khasji Wala, who was seized by the soldiery, probably less from any hostile feeling than a desire to employ him as the tool of their rapacity. Hence ensued a military conflict between those who seized the minister and those supporting the maha-ranee and her party; but after a brief and feeble engagement, the soldiers agreed to make\n\n* Mama, \"maternal uncle;\" Sahib, \"lord, sir.\" A somewhat corresponding title of honour may be found in the monsieur of the elder branch of the French royal family.\n\n\u2020 Dada means \"paternal grandfather,\" and also \"elder brother;\" but to whom the chief in question stood in either of these relations, is not anywhere stated. \"Khasji\" is, \"steward of the household.\"\n\n1 Shakespeare, col. 1569.\n2 Id. 1181.\ncommon cause, intelligence having arrived that a large British force had been concentrated at Agra. Reinforcements were thereupon called in from every side, ammunition in large quantity was served\\(^1\\) to the troops of all arms, and extensive preparations of every kind made for war. The Dada Khaji Wala was given up to the British authorities; but all order had now ceased in Scindia's territories; the zemindars refused to pay in the rents, and any semblance of rule that remained, depended altogether upon the will of the soldiery. The British government then resolved\\(^2\\) upon advancing, for the purpose of obtaining full security for the future tranquillity of the common frontier, for the maintenance of order within the territories of Scindia, and for the conducting of the government of those territories in accordance with the established relations of amity towards the British government. It was required\\(^3\\) that the army of Gwalior should be reduced within reasonable limits. These objects were avowed in the proclamations\\(^4\\) issued by the Governor-General on the entrance of the British forces into the Gwalior territory, towards the close of the month of December, 1843. On the 21st December, the British army, led by Sir Hugh Gough, commander-in-chief, accompanied by Lord Ellenborough, governor-general, commenced\\(^5\\) crossing the Chumbul near the town of Dhlopore, and by the 26th of the same month the whole had passed to the right side, and encamped at Hingona, twenty-three\\(^6\\) miles north-west of the fort of Gwalior. This force advancing on the 29th, came in front of the Mahratta army about fifteen miles north-east of Gwalior, and in a position supported by the neighbouring villages of Maharajpore and Chonda. After an obstinate engagement, in which the British suffered very severe loss from the well-served artillery directed against them, the Mahrattas were dislodged from all points of their position, and the survivors of the carnage retreated to Gwalior, having lost fifty-six pieces of artillery\\(^7\\) and all their ammunition-waggons. The total loss on the side of the British was 106 killed, 684 wounded, and seven missing. The numbers engaged were probably nearly equal,\u2014about 14,000 on each side. Simultaneous with the march of the commander-in-chief from Dhlopore was that of Major-General Grey, with an army probably of about 8,000 or 9,000 men, from Bundelcund.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Gwalior Papers, 116.\n\n\\(^2\\) Id. 180.\n\n\\(^3\\) Id. 184.\n\n\\(^4\\) Papers respecting Gwalior, ordered by House of Commons to be printed, 12 March, 1844, pp. 15, 16, 17, 18.\n\n\\(^5\\) Additional Gwalior Papers, 136.\n\n\\(^6\\) Garden, Tables of Routes, 22.\n\n\\(^7\\) Id. 162-166.\nGWALIOR.\n\nCrossing the river Sinde at Chandpore, this force marched to Puniaur, twelve miles south-west of Gwalior, and there, on the 29th December, encountered a Mahratta army, despatched from the capital, and estimated at 12,000 strong, with twenty-four guns. The Mahrattas, after a severe struggle, were defeated, with the loss of all their artillery and a great number of men. The loss on the part of the British was twenty-five killed, and 189 wounded. On the 4th of January, 1844, the fort of Gwalior was occupied by the contingent force, commanded by British officers; and thus passed into the power of the East-India Company this celebrated stronghold, which effectually commanded the Lashkar,* or stationary camp, at its base, where 5,000 refractory troops, amply supplied with artillery, still held out; but all hope of successful resistance having ceased, they accepted the offer made to them of full liquidation of all arrears, with the addition of a gratuity of three months' pay, and, surrendering their artillery and small-arms, they quietly dispersed. It has been recently determined that no further repairs shall be made to the fort. On the 13th January, 1844, was concluded a treaty, by which various previously existing treaties were confirmed, except so far as they might be affected by the stipulations of the new one. The contingent force for the protection of Scindia's territory, originally provided for in the treaty of Serjee Angengau (1803), by the assignment of certain districts for its maintenance, was to be increased,\u2020 and the revenues of other districts, in addition to the former, were, by a schedule to the new treaty, appropriated to that purpose, as well as, it would appear, to defray the charges of the civil administration of such districts, which was to be conducted by the British government for Scindia. To meet sundry debts due to the British government, and to cover various charges incurred by\n\n* Lashkar, \"army,\" in Persian.\n\n\u2020 The accounts between the British government and Scindia had long before this period become much complicated and very intricate. Certain arrangements were made in 1817 for defraying Scindia's share of the expenses of the Pindarry war; but the payments fell short of the charges, and it was consequently agreed (1820) to reduce the contingent, and to make an assignment of territory in liquidation of the debt. Subsequently (1836) a part of the assigned territory was restored, in consideration of an annual payment.\nthe misconduct of that of Scindia, a sum of twenty-six lacs was to be paid within fourteen days from the date of the treaty; in default of which, territory described in another schedule was to be assigned as provision for the payment of the principal debt, and the interest accruing thereon, together with the charges of the civil administration. The military force maintained by Scindia beyond the contingent was not to exceed 9,000 men, of whom not more than one-third were to be infantry. During the minority of the maharajah, all acts of government were to be under the control of the British resident, the administration being vested in a council of regency. Three lacs of rupees were set apart as a provision for the maharanee. Such was the position of the relations under the treaty between Gwalior and the British government.\n\nThe exemplary character, however, of the young maharajah, and his high promise of qualifications for government, led to his being intrusted with the administration of his dominions before the expiration of his minority. The formal act of coronation was postponed until the attainment of his majority in 1853, when, by its performance, the young rajah was solemnly confirmed in the authority which he had previously exercised. His conduct subsequent to his assumption of power has fully justified the high opinion previously entertained of this prince.\n\nGWLIOIR.\u2014A celebrated hill-fort, the capital of the possessions of Scindia\u2019s family. The rock on which it is situate, is completely isolated, though 700 yards to the north is a conical hill, surmounted by a remarkable building of stone; and on the south-east, the south, and the south-west, are similar hills, which form a sort of amphitheatre, at the distance of from one to four miles. Near the place, and on the east of it, runs the small river Soowunreeka, nearly dry, except during the rains. The rock of Gwalior, and the ranges in its vicinity, are of ochreous sandstone, capped in some places with basalt, which appears to have formerly universally overspread them, and the fragments of which lying at their bases, form slopes for a considerable distance up their sides.\n\n* Guwaler of Tassin; Gualiar of Briggs\u2019s Index, and of the Ayen Akbery; Gualior of the translators of Baber; Gwalior of Elphinstone, and generally of the British writers.\nsandstone of the hill-fort is arranged in horizontal strata, and its face presents so steep a fracture, as to form a perpendicular precipice, rising above the upper limit of the slope. Where the rock was naturally less precipitous, it has been so scarped as to be rendered perpendicular; and in some places the upper part considerably overhangs the lower. The greatest length of the rock, which is from north-east to south-west, is a mile* and a half, the greatest breadth 300 yards. The height at the north end, where it is greatest, is 342 feet. On the eastern face of the rock, several\u2020 colossal figures are sculptured in bold relief. A rampart runs round the edge of the rock, conforming to the outline of its summit; and as its height is uniform above the verge, its top has an irregular appearance. The entrance within the inclosure of the rampart is towards the north end of the east side; first, by means of a steep road, and higher up by steps\u2021 cut in the face of the rock, of such a size and of so moderate a degree of acclivity, that elephants easily make their way up. This huge staircase is protected on the outer side by a high and massive stone wall, and is swept by several traversing-guns pointing down it; the passage up to the interior being through a succession of seven gates. The principal gate is called Hatipul, or the elephant\u2019s gate, from the figure of that animal sculptured\u00a7 over it. The citadel is at the north-eastern extremity of the inclosure, and has a very striking\u00b6 appearance. The outline of the great\n\n* According to Hunter\u00b9 and Sleeman\u00b2; but, according to Scott,\u00b3 \u201cfour miles.\u201d Sleeman gives the breadth at a quarter of a mile, which somewhat exceeds that given by Hunter.\n\n\u2020 They are described by Baber, who mentions\u2074 one forty feet high, which he ordered to be destroyed; but, losing the place soon after, his power of enforcing his mandate ceased, and the image remains. A writer in a recent publication,\u2075 states it to be an image of Parawanath, the twenty-third Jaina. He adds, \u201cOne object of curiosity is a massive Jain temple, built 700 years since, now in ruins;\u201d and proceeds: \u201cThe only other object worthy of attention, is the Thailee ka lath (Teli ka lath), a lofty temple now in ruins, built with a part of the accumulated wealth of an oilman in Aober Shah\u2019s time.\u201d The temple and lath are perhaps the structures described by Hunter:\u2076\u2014\u201cAbout the middle of the fort are two remarkable pyramidal buildings of red stone: they are in the most ancient style of Hindoo architecture, and are said to have been built for the residence of the mother-in-law and sister-in-law of a rajah who reigned in a very remote period, when this fortress was the capital of an extensive empire.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 Hodges, Travels in India, 137.\n\u00b2 Id.

Along the eastern side of those buildings extends horizontally, in the upper part, a course of bricks or tiles of brilliant blue colour, like coarse porcelain; and the effect produced by this great vivid streak is singular, but not unpleasing. There are within the inclosure of the rampart several spacious tanks, capable of supplying an adequate garrison, though, according to a military author, 15,000 men would be required fully to man the defences. The old town of Gwalior is situate along the eastern base of the rock. It is of considerable size, having a street a mile long, and has many good houses of stone; but is very irregularly built, and extremely filthy. It contains a very beautiful building of white sandstone, with a cupola covered with blue porcelain tiles, beneath which lie the remains of Muhammad Ghouz, a famous sage, celebrated for his sanctity in the time of Akbar. The Lashkar, or stationary camp of the maharajah, is represented as extending several miles from the south-west end of the rock, and as being a place of considerable traffic and wealth; but the great reduction of the military force of the state must cause a diminution of the prosperity of this establishment. It has been described as a very filthy collection of rude buildings, even the residence of the maharajah being of mean exterior, and those of the rest, in appearance little better than hovels, though much wealth, the proceeds of a long course of rapine, was stored within them.\n\nThere are scarcely any manufactures in Gwalior, except artillery-founding, and the making of gunpowder and fireworks for the prince and court.\n\nAccording to the researches of Wilford, the fort of Gwalior was built in 778, by Surya-Sena, rajah of a small territory lying about the rock. Ferishta, however, assigns it a date antecedent to the commencement of the Christian era. In 1023, it was besieged by the celebrated Mahmood of Ghuznee, who found the attempt to capture it hopeless, and marched away, taking a present. After a long siege in 1196, it was taken.\n\n* Scott, quoted in Hodges, appears to be in error in stating \"at the north-west foot of the mountain is the town.\"\nGWALIOR.\n\nby Bahauddin, or Kutbuddin Eibak, lieutenants of Shaha-\nbuddin, or Muhammad, of Ghor. In 1211, it was lost by the\nMussulmans, but recovered in 1231, after a blockade for a\nyear, by Shamsuddin Altamsh, the slave king of Delhi.*\nNarsingh Rae, a Hindoo chief, taking advantage of the troubles\nproduced by the invasion of Tamerlane in 1398, took Gwalior,4\nwhich was not recovered by the Mussulmans until 1519, when\nit was retaken5 by Ibrahim Lodi, the Patan sovereign of\nDelhi; after whose defeat and death in battle against Baber,\nit was seized by a Patan adventurer. In 1526, Baber6 gained\nit by stratagem, and in 1543, after the expulsion of his son\nHumayon, it fell into the hands7 of his successful rival Sher\nShah; but, after the return and re-establishment of Humayon,\nit was, in 1556,8 recovered by his successor Akbar, who made\nit the state prison for captives of importance. Here he con-\nfined, and subsequently put to death, his first cousin, Abul-\nkasim, son of the ill-fated Kamran. Here also Aurungzebe\nconfined9 his brother Morad, and shortly after put him to\ndeath. The same suspicious and cruel sovereign consigned to\nthis prison the son of Morad, and his nephews Soliman and\nSepehr Sheko, the sons of Dara, who here quickly found a\ngrave. In the dismemberment of the empire of Delhi, Gwalior\nwas\u2020 seized1 by the Jat rana of Gohud. It subsequently\nchanged hands, and in 17792 was garrisoned by Scindia, from\nwhom it was taken by the forces of the East-India Company,\non the 3rd August, with little trouble and small loss.

At break of day, the van arrived at the foot of the scarped rock, the spies ascended by wooden ladders, and having made fast ladders of ropes, the troops followed. Some resistance was offered, but the garrison was intimidated by the unexpected attack, and the assailants were soon masters of the place. Transferred by the British government to the rana of Gohud, it was in 1784 recovered by Madhajee Scindia, from whom it was again taken in 1803, but restored in 1805, \"from considerations,\" [it was said,] of friendship.\" Finally, in January, 1844, subsequently to the battle of Maharajpoor, it was occupied by the Gwalior contingent, commanded by British officers; and thus has virtually been placed within the power of the British government.

It is bounded on the north by the Gulf of Cutch; on the north-east by the districts Muchoo-Kanta and Jhalawar; on the east by the district of Kattywar; on the south by the districts of Kattywar and Soruth; on the south-west by the district of Burda and the Arabian Sea; and on the west by the district of Okamundal, from which it is divided by a small runn or salt-marsh. It lies between lat. \\(21^\\circ 39'\\)\u2014\\(22^\\circ 50'\\), long. \\(69^\\circ 9'\\)\u2014\\(71^\\circ 3'\\); is about 130 miles in length from east to west, and 75 in extreme breadth. Its area may be stated at about 4,960 square miles. Nearly equidistant from the northern and southern boundaries, the ground rises into rocky hills, along which lies the line of waterheads; the streams flowing from it northwards into the Gulf of Cutch, and southwards into the Arabian Sea. Of the streams which flow northward, the principal are the Ajee and its tributary the Mari, the And, the Nagne, and the Ghi; of those flowing in the other direction, the principal are the Phohun and the Mun, tributaries of the Bhadur, a large river flowing south-westward into the Arabian Sea. The smaller streams being very numerous, the district is remarkably well watered. The eastern part is hilly and rocky, yet nearly devoid of wood, which is but scanty throughout the district. The soil is in general light, and well suited for the\ngrowth of wheat, millet, and maize. A considerable quantity of cotton is also grown in the north-western part, towards the seashore, and exported principally to Cutch. At Naunagar, a seaport, and the principal town of the district, are considerable manufactories\\(^2\\) of cloths of various kinds; and the dyes given to fabrics there are considered of a very superior kind, their excellence being attributed to the quality of the water of the river Nagne, which flows by the town. Piece-goods are also manufactured there, for the Arabian and African markets. The only other seaports of any importance are Juriya and Serria. Those, as well as the other towns,\u2014Balumba, Rajkot, Lalpoor, Gondul, Draupa, Dhurol,\u2014are noticed under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement. The greater part of this district belongs to the thakoors or chiefs of Naunagar, Gondul, Rajkot, Dhurol, and Kotra Sangani. The total population is estimated at 358,560\\(^3\\) an amount which, compared with the area, indicates a relative density of seventy-two to the square mile. The annual tribute by the various chiefs and landholders is stated to be 345,778 rupees; of which the sum of 161,598 rupees is paid to the British government, 167,495 to the Guicowar, and 16,685 to the nawaub of Joonghur.\n\nHALLOWAL, in the Reechna Dooab division of the Punjab, a town situated nine miles from the right bank of the Ravee, 53 miles N.E. of the town of Lahore.

Lat. \\(23^\\circ 11'\\), long. \\(88^\\circ 38'\\).\n\nHANGO, or HUNG,\\(^1\\) in Bussahir, a village of Koonawur, in the Tartar division called Hungrung, is situate near the\nHANLE.\n\nnorth-eastern base of the Hungrung Mountains. It consists of three or four hamlets or small subdivisions, and is situate at the head of a fertile and cultivated dell, a mile long, and about half that breadth, bearing luxuriant crops of corn and pulse, and watered by three never-failing streams, which flow down it to the river Li. The fertility of this spot appears to result from irrigation acting upon debris of limestone, and forms a striking and delightful contrast with the surrounding country, which, according to the description of Gerard, is dreary in the extreme. \"To the south-west, the faces of the mountains assume a less savage character, but they are arid and stripped of soil. No grass covers them, but a few tufts of aromatic plants and broom is all the vegetation they present. The want of moisture in the bowels of the mountains, the gravelly nature of their surface, which reverberates the fierce rays of the sun, and the dry state of the air, give a parched feature to the country, which is more bleak and desolate than the regions of perpetual snow.\" Hango is noted for a temple, of high repute among the natives, and apparently devoted to a mongrel superstition, half Brahminical and half Lamaic. It is a large building, crowded inside with grotesque idols, the principal of which is a large earthenware figure of a hideous man, wearing a diadem of human skulls, and an enormous necklace of the same, reaching down to the ground, and in his right hand the hilt of a sword, in his left a human skull, cut down to the form of a drinking-cup. An enormous serpent, with protruded tongue, is twined round his neck, and is of such a length as to reach the ground with its head. The idol holds in its arms a woman, whose head is also crowned with a chaplet of skulls, and who bears in her hand a skull, formed into a drinking-cup, the group being apparently intended to represent incarnations of the deities in a state of wrath. The village contains thirty families of Tartars and a few nuns, and, according to Herbert, gives names to the surrounding district of Hungrung. Elevation above the sea 11,400 feet. Lat. 31\u00b0 49', long. 78\u00b0 34'.\n\nHANLE.\u2014A town in the native state of Cashmere, or dominions of Gholab Singh, 154 miles N.E. from Simla, and 166 miles E. by N. from Chamba. Lat. 32\u00b0 43', long. 78\u00b0 56'.\nHANSEE.\u2014A town in the British district of Hurreeanah, lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces. It is situate on the watercourse made, in 1356, by Feroz Toghluk, king of Delhi, who, in some places clearing and deepening the bed of the Chitang torrent, and in others excavating a channel, conducted a branch from the Delhi Canal westward beyond Hissar, until it either disembogued into the Gagur, or was lost by evaporation or absorption in the arid waste. Hansee appears to have been an important place as early as 1036, when Massaoud, the son of the renowned Mahmud of Ghuznee, invaded India; as, according to Ferishta, \"the Hindoos reckoned it impregnable, and were taught to believe that it could never fall into the hands of the Mahomedans. On this occasion, the India soothsayers, like those of other nations, deceived their followers, for, in the space of six days, the king escaladed the place, and took it by storm. Herein he found immense treasure.\" Tiefenthaler, writing about the middle of the last century, describes it as having a ruinous brick-built fort, situate on a hill. The canal must also, at that time, have been in a ruinous state, as the place suffered from want of water insomuch that there was only one crop in the year, and that dependent on the periodical rains. In 1798, when for a short period it was the capital of the adventurer George Thomas, it was supplied with water from wells, none other being procurable for above a dozen miles. \"Here,\" says Thomas, \"I established my capital, rebuilt the walls of the city, which had long since fallen to decay, and repaired the fortification. As it has been long deserted, at first I found difficulty in procuring inhabitants, but by degrees, and gentle treatment, I selected between five and six thousand persons, to whom I allowed every lawful indulgence. I established a mint, and coined my own rupees, which I made current in my army and country; cast my own artillery, commenced making muskets, matchlocks, and powder.\" In 1801, Thomas, being besieged here by a vastly superior force of Mahrattas, under the French adventurer Perron, evacuated the place, and took refuge in the territory of the East-India Company. The population has been recently\n\n* Denominated by Abul Fazl Hansy. It is also spelt Hansi in the Index to Briggs's Ferishta.\n\n---\n\n1 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.\n2 Ferishta, i. 490.\n3 Journ. As. Soc.

The road to the south-east of the town, or in the direction of Delhi, is good; to the west, it is also good, running the whole way to Hissar along the bank of the canal. Hansee is distant N.W. from Delhi 89\u00b0 miles, N.W. from Calcutta 989 miles. Lat. 29\u00b0 6', long. 76\u00b0 3'.\n\nHANSOUTEE.\u2014A river, rising in lat. 27\u00b0 58', long. 76\u00b0 7', in the native state of Jhujhur, a few miles south of the town of Narol, and flowing in a north-easterly direction for seventy-five miles, alternately through Jhujhur and the British territory of Goorgaon, and for twenty-two miles through that of Delhi, falls into the Delhi Canal, a few miles north of the town of Delhi, in lat. 28\u00b0 40', long. 77\u00b0 15'.\n\nHANSOTE, in the British district of Broach, presidency of Bombay, a town near the south-eastern bank of the estuary of the river Nerbudda. Population 5,000. Distance from Surat, N., 28 miles. Lat. 21\u00b0 32', long. 72\u00b0 50'.\n\nHAPOOR.\u2014See HAUPUR.\n\nHARAMUK.\u2014A lofty summit in the range bounding Cashmere on the north. Vigne states, that \"Haramuk signifies all mouths or faces, and that the application of the word in this case is either derived from the square-sided, rick-shaped figure of its summit, or from its being visible from all sides, by reason of its isolated situation and superior height.\" Its mass appears to consist principally of basaltic amygdaloid, though granite has been observed on it, but not in situ. In a depression on the northern declivity is a small lake, called Gunga Bul,\u2014\u201cthe place of the Ganges,\u201d which, like many other reservoirs of water, is held in high veneration by the Hindoos. The elevation of Haramuk above the level of the sea is estimated by Vigne at 13,000 feet. Lat. 34\u00b0 26', long. 75\u00b0.\n\nHARAPA.\u2014A village of the Punjab, close to the left bank of the Ravee, and seated amid very extensive ruins, the most striking being the relics of a large brick fortress. This is considered by Masson to be the site of the Sangala of Arrian, where the Indians made such an obstinate defence against Alexander; but this opinion is regarded by eminent authority as open to question. Professor Wilson observes, \"Whether they (the Macedonians) followed the course of the Iravati (Ravee) to Harapa, may be reasonably doubted.\" Harapa is in lat. 30\u00b0 40', long. 72\u00b0 53'.\nHARAWUG.\u2014A castle in the north of the Punjab, on the route from Lahore to Cashmere by the Banihal Pass, and 28 miles S. of the last-mentioned place. It is built of wood, in a ravine on the right bank of a stream which, at a short distance below, falls into the Chenaub. From the hill above is a noble view up that river, which here flows for fifteen or twenty miles in a straight line. The coldness of the water of the Chenaub causes its course in hot weather to be marked by dense vapour, which floats over it. Harawug is in lat. $33^\\circ 12'$, long. $75^\\circ 3'$.\n\nHARIHARPOOR, in the British district of Goruckpore, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a petty market-town on the Jamura, a small river, a feeder of the Rapti. According to Buchanan's report, thirty years ago, it contained 150 houses; and allowing six persons to each, consequently a population of 900. Distant S.W. from Goruckpore cantonment 22 miles. Lat. $26^\\circ 45'$, long. $83^\\circ 2'$.\n\nHARIKE, in the Punjab, a village situate on the right bank of the Ghara river, three miles below the confluence of the Sutluj and Beas. The name Ghara is in this instance given to the river with some latitude, as it is not usually so called above a spot twelve miles below Harike. The site of the village is on the high bank of the river, and, when the water is low, distant a mile and a half from the ferry. Though a small place, the trade is important, and twenty years ago, nearly the whole traffic with Hindostan, from Afghanistan, Kashmir, and the Punjab, passed through it. There is besides great local traffic between the districts in its immediate vicinity on both sides of the river. During some days that Wade remained there, thirty-two boats, with three men to each, were incessantly employed, from morning till night, in transporting loaded carriages and beasts of burthen from one side to the other. No diminution of activity was observable during the period, but there was throughout a uniform scene of bustle and business. Harike is in lat. $31^\\circ 10'$, long. $74^\\circ 59'$.\n\nHARIPOOR, in the Punjab, a town on the great route by the Dub Pass into Cashmere, is a populous and thriving place, with a handsome and well-supplied bazar. Von H\u00fcgel considers it one of the wealthiest places in the Punjab, the streets being thronged with a busy and cheerful crowd, exhibiting evident\nHAR.\n\nindications of prosperity, and the shops supplied with all that can contribute to the gratification of Indian taste. It is situate on the river Dor, which, about ten miles westward, falls into the Indus near Torbela. Lat. 34\u00b0 14', long. 72\u00b0 57'.\n\nHARIPOOR, in the north-east of the Punjab, among the lower mountains of the Himalaya, is a fort, surrounded by a small town, which contains a good and well-supplied bazar. The name signifies the town of Hari, one of the incarnations of Vishnu, and Hindoo superstition here flourishes in the highest degree of vigour. The town and its vicinity are crowded with apes and peafowl, considered to be under the protection of the deity, and enjoying in consequence such a measure of respect as secures them from all molestation. Haripoor is in lat. 31\u00b0 56', long. 76\u00b0 11'.\n\nHARIPOOR,\u00b9 in the British district of Jaunsar, at the southern frontier, where it joins the Dehra Doon, a village in the bifurcation at the confluence of the Tons and Jumna. Though the Tons loses its name, and the united stream continues to be called the Jumna, the former is the larger, its discharge per second, when surveyed by Hodgson, being 2,827 cubic feet, and that of the latter 1,045. Elevation above the sea 1,686 feet.\u00b2 Lat. 30\u00b0 30', long. 77\u00b0 54'.\n\nHARIPOOR, in Cashmere, a small town situate in the Punch Pass from the Punjab into that valley, and near the spot where the pass opens into the low ground of Cashmere. It is close to the right bank of the Rembeara, a considerable feeder of the Veyut or Jhelum. Hence the Rembeara is sometimes called the River of Haripoor. The town is small and mean, remarkable only for its picturesque site beneath the Pir Panjal mountain, which on the south rears its towering summit, covered with snow during the greater part of the year. Lat. 33\u00b0 40', long. 74\u00b0 51'.\n\nHARNHULLY.\u2014A town in the native state of Mysore, 64 miles N.W. by N. from Seringapatam, and 96 miles E.N.E. from Mangalore.

Lat. 21\u00b0 51', long. 86\u00b0 46'.\nHARRISON'S ISLAND.\u2014A small island lying off the coast of Arracan, situate about ten miles from the shore, and among the cluster of islands to the south of Ramree. Lat. 18\u00b0 40', long. 94\u00b0 2'.\n\nHARU, a small river of the Punjab, rises at the base of the Himalaya, and receiving the Nilab from the north-east, and several smaller streams, flows in the Indus on the eastern side, a few miles below Attock, after a course of about sixty miles. This confluence is in lat. 33\u00b0 49', long. 72\u00b0 16'.\n\nHASHTNUGGUR, in the Daman division of the Punjab, a town situated on the left bank of the Lundye, 20 miles N. of the town of Peshawur.

In 1690 it was conquered by Chikka Deo,\u00b3 rajah of Mysore, and incorporated with his dominions. Distant from Bangalore, W., 102 miles; from Mangalore, E., 88. Lat. 13\u00b0, long. 76\u00b0 9'.\n\nHASSAN ABDAL,\u00b9 in the Punjab, so called from containing the tomb of a reputed Mahometan saint of that name. It is situate in a delightful valley,\u00b2 watered by numerous springs, which gush from among the rocks.* Here are the ruins of a pleasure-ground and small palace, tastefully formed by the Mogul emperor Akbar, and though much decayed, displaying yet an exquisite combination of elegance and refined luxury.

It is a small well-built fort, on the summit of a conical hill, three miles and a half W. of Lohughat or Rikhesur. Water can be\n\n* Burns states, \"some hundred springs;\" Von H\u00fcgel, three (iii. 97). This last writer (iii. 71) denies that the place is a valley; he also reproves Moore and Hamilton for giving too flattering a description of it; but it is not to be forgotten that the gorgeous Akbar expressed the feelings excited in his mind on the view of the spot, by exclaiming Wah! the usual interjection of admiration; and hence the ruined garden is still so named. Elphinstone styles it a valley; and the authorities to which we have referred, and even the baron himself subsequently (98, 99), are warm in their praises of the beauties of the place.\nHAT.\n\nobtained only from the bottom of the hill, at a distance of half a mile of steep descent, so that the post, if regularly invested, must speedily fall. The artillery attached to Fort Hastings consists of two field howitzers, two brass six-pounders, four iron twelve-pounders, with an ample supply of ammunition. Elevation above the sea 6,240 feet. Lat. 29\u00b0 25', long. 80\u00b0 5'.\n\nHATEE, in Baghelcund, a town in the native state of Rewah, on the route from Mirzapoor to Lohogaon, 110 miles direct S.W. of Mirzapoor, 58 S.E. of Banda.

The road in this part of the route is good; the country open, and partially cultivated. Lat. 28\u00b0 21', long. 77\u00b0 56'.\n\nHATIYA.\u2014A town in the native state of Nepal, on the right bank of the river Arun, and 97 miles E. by N. from Khatmandoo. Lat. 27\u00b0 58', long. 86\u00b0 50'.\n\nHATRAS, the principal place of a pergunnah of the same name, in the district of Allygurh, within the limits of the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lies on the route from the cantonment of Agra to that of Allygurh, 33 miles N. of the former. It is built in the form of a square of about 500 yards, and is surrounded by a mud wall and a very deep dry ditch. The old fort is situate half a mile due east of the town, and though now a heap of ruins, was once regarded as formidable. When approached by the British troops in 1804, while in pursuit of Holkar's army in the Doab, Thorn describes it as built* on a small hill, with a gradual ascent; and he continues: \"In the centre of it stands a very\n\n* Hamilton says, \"The fort is an oblong, its long diameter running nearly from west to east, measuring 1,600 yards round the glacis.

The glacis is about 100 yards wide; and a renny-wall (fausse-braie), with a deep, dry, and broad ditch behind it, surrounds the fort.\" The owner, a talookdar or renter of the surrounding district, on the occasion of Holkar's invasion, as well as at other times, acted with hostility towards the British; and at length his assumption of independence was found so mischievous and alarming, especially in the threatening state of affairs at the commencement of the Mahratta war in 1817, that it was found necessary to dislodge him. Dya Ram, who held the place at that time, was accordingly summoned to surrender the fort, and allow measures to be taken for its being dismantled. Trusting in the defences, which had been strengthened in imitation of those of the neighbouring British fort of Allygurh, by preparing a covered way, raising a glacis, and diminishing the height of the ramparts, the occupant refused compliance; whereupon, on the 23rd February, 1817, the town was breached and evacuated; and on the 1st of March fire was opened on the fort from forty-five mortars and three breaching-batteries of heavy guns. At the close of the same day, a magazine in the fort exploded, and caused such destruction of the garrison and buildings, that Dya Ram, terror-struck, abandoned the place in the course of the night, and it was forthwith dismantled, as well as the neighbouring fortress of Mursan, and some others. The population of this town, always considerable, has much increased since its direct subjection to British sway, the number of its inhabitants in 1848 being returned at 22,903. It is the chief mart for the cotton of the neighbouring tracts, which is forwarded by easy land-carriage to Furruckabad on the Ganges, and conveyed by that river to the lower provinces.

It is situate five miles north of Almora, and on the left bank of the Kosilla, running at a considerable depth below, with a deep, black, and violent current. The site is picturesque and fine, and as the climate is warmer than that of Almora, in consequence of an elevation less by 1,900 feet, it is generally the residence of the civil officers in charge of that town, and of the district of Kumaon.

Jacquemont, who visited it in 1829, styles it a large village. Its principal bazar is regularly built, and some of the shops and houses, which are all of mud, are two stories high. It was formerly a place of more importance than at present, having been for some time the head-quarters for a regiment of the Queen's infantry, when a church was built, on the supposition of the permanent cantonment at that place, of an European regiment. In 1845, the station ceased to be a cantonment for European troops, and now is occupied by a detachment of the Ramgurh native battalion. It is also the station of a principal assistant to the Governor-General's agent for the south-west frontier, and contains a jail for civil and criminal prisoners. Hazareebagh is situate in an extensive and elevated plateau, overspread with forest and jungle, and having in many places the remains of mango-groves and other regular plantations, indicating the country to have been\n\n* Hazaribag of Tassin; Hazarbg of Jacquemont; properly Hazaribagh, Commandant's-garden; from Hazari, \"commander,\" and Bagh, \"garden.\"\n\n\u2020 Hazareebagh is situate about twenty miles south of the grand trunk road from Calcutta to Benares, via Burdwan; but upon the completion of this portion of the road, orders were issued for connecting Hazareebagh with the new line.\nHAZ\u2014HEE.\n\nformerly much better peopled and cultivated.

The village is situate about a mile from the right bank of the Indus. Lat. 26\u00b0 32', long. 67\u00b0 53'.\n\nHIDGELLEE.\u00b9\u2014A British district situate within the jurisdiction of the presidency of Bengal. It is bounded on the north-east by the Hoogly river, separating it from the British districts of Hoogly and the Twenty-four Pergunnahs; on the south-east by the river Hoogly and the Bay of Bengal; on the west by the Balasore division of Cuttack, and by the British district of Midnapore. It lies between lat. 21\u00b0 36'\u201422\u00b0 22', long. 87\u00b0 22'\u201488\u00b0 12', and has an area of 1,014 square miles.\u00b2 It has a considerable length of coast, commencing at its southwestern extremity, in lat. 21\u00b0 36', long. 87\u00b0 26', and washed by the Bay of Bengal for twenty miles, as far as the mouth of the\nsmall river Mahona, where the estuary of the Hoogly may be considered to commence, in lat. 21\u00b0 42', long. 87\u00b0 48'. The shore of this estuary continues to form the boundary of the district for eleven miles in a direction north-east, to the mouth of the Russoolpoor river, in lat. 21\u00b0 48', long. 87\u00b0 55'; and, in the same direction, for seventeen miles, to the mouth of the Huldee; thence, still north-east, for twelve miles, to Diamond Point, in lat. 22\u00b0 7', long. 88\u00b0 12', where it turns north-westward for eighteen miles, to Tumlook, in lat. 22\u00b0 18', long. 88\u00b0 2'.\n\nThe inside channel, giving access from the Bay of Bengal to the Hoogly, extends along the whole of this coast as far as the mouth of the Roopnarain. This was formerly the deepest and most-frequented channel; and Kedgeree, about eight miles above, or north-east of the Russoolpoor river, was much used as an anchorage for the largest ships; but of late years the channel has become silted up, so as to have not more than two or three fathoms water, and is now frequented only by country vessels. The Roopnarain does not appear to be navigable for large ships, and the flood-tide setting strongly up into it, many vessels making for the Hoogly, on their way to Calcutta, have been swept up the shallow estuary and lost.\n\nBesides the Hoogly, the Roopnarain, and the Russoolpoor river, the only stream of importance belonging to the district is the Huldee, which, rising in Midnapore, crosses the north-western frontier of this district in lat. 22\u00b0 8', long. 88\u00b0 45', and, holding a course easterly for about thirty-five miles, falls into the estuary of the Hoogly, in lat. 22\u00b0, long. 88\u00b0 8'. The streams above mentioned, though nearly dry during the greater part of the year, contribute largely to swell the Hoogly during the periodical rains.\n\nPerhaps the topography of no part of India has received less attention than that of this district, of which scarcely anything is known, except that it resembles the adjacent British district of Cuttack in being level and low; having many swamps and shallow pieces of water, and numerous small winding streams, which are subject to great inundations during the periodical rains, and are infested with large and very dangerous alligators. Many parts are overgrown with jungle, or covered with a coarse reedy grass. The jungle affords brushwood, valuable as fuel to the salt manufacturers, but harbours tigers, leopards, wild buffaloes,\nand other dangerous beasts. A considerable quantity of fine salt is manufactured by a rude but effective process. The sea along the coast is remarkably productive, and the fisheries are pursued with eagerness and success. Turtle, oysters, crabs, and prawns, are among the delicacies which reward the industry thus employed.\n\nThe climate, especially in the more depressed and moist parts, is very unhealthy even to the natives, who are greatly affected by elephantiasis, dysentery, agues, and fevers. Rice is the principal crop, and is produced of a large size, and in great luxuriance and abundance, but is considered inferior to the average produce of Bengal and Behar. The other crops are sugarcane, tobacco, pulse, cucurbitaceous plants, millet, mustard, castor-oil plant, and other oil-yielding productions, hemp, safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), sweet potatoes, capsicum, and various pootherbs. The cocoanut-palm and the toddy-palm (Borassus flabelliformis), from the fermented juice of which an ardent spirit is distilled, grow in the maritime tracts. There are no manufactures of any importance, unless that of salt be considered as such.\n\nThe population is estimated at about 138,265.\n\nThe only routes are\u20141. From north-east to south-west, from Calcutta to the town of Contai or Hidgellee; 2. from southeast to north-west, from the town of Hidgellee to that of Midnapore. This district was included in the grant of the dewanny of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, made to the East-India Company by the emperor of Delhi, in August, 1765.\n\nHIDGELLEE.\u2014A town in the British district of the same name, under the presidency of Bengal. It is situate on the right or western shore of one of the entrances of the Hoogly, called the Inner Channel, and at the mouth of a small river falling into it. The civil establishment of the district appears to have been removed to the town of Contai. Distance from Calcutta, S.W., 48 miles; from Midnapore, S.E., 82.

Lat. $25^\\circ 17'$, long. $85^\\circ 22'$.\n\nHILL STATES.\u00b9\u2014Under this name are included a number of small sovereignties or chieftainships in the Cis-Sutlej territory, all of which appear to have possessed some degree at least of independence, till overrun and subjugated by the encroaching power of the Goorkhas. On\u00b2 the breaking out of the war with Nepaul in 1814, Sir David Ochterlony issued a proclamation inviting the various chiefs to co-operate with the British, and promising to such as should satisfactorily comply with the call, confirmation in their hereditary possessions, and protection from future attempts at aggression. A few only entitled themselves to the benefits held out: some had fled from the oppression of their invaders, some kept back from fear, and probably some distrusted the promises of the British government, and were apprehensive that by compliance with the required conditions, they should but exchange one tyranny for another. The success of the British army removed all ground for hesitation, and put an end to the opportunity of choosing between the Goorkhas and their conquerors. All the chieftains now became candidates for the exercise of either the justice or the clemency of the triumphant power, and the liberality of the British government was manifested in admitting claims which had been justly forfeited, and restoring possessions which the fortune of war had placed at its disposal. A part of Gurwhal was restored to its fugitive rajah; the remainder, consisting of the districts situate to the eastward, above the confluence of the Mandakini and the Aluknunda, together with the Dehra Dhoon, the pergunnah of Raeengurh, Subathoo, and Sewah, were retained by the victors, as was also the pergunnah of Sundock, in which is a cantonment for British troops. Burrowlee passed to the rajah of Nalagurh or Hindoor, in exchange for Malown, occupied as a British post. Bughat was dismembered, and a portion disposed of to the rajah of Pattecala; the remainder has since lapsed to the paramount power, from failure of heirs. A claim, however, to the succession has been recently preferred by a first cousin of the last two chiefs. The claim was not allowed, but a discretionary authority was given to the local government either to retain\nthe estate, or, if more expedient, to bestow it on the claimant by a new sunnud: this was in 1849. The former alternative was adopted, and Bughat is now a British possession. Keyonthul, like Bughat, was subjected to the process of dismemberment, and the excised part was transferred to the rajah of Patteela. In consideration of this alienation, the remainder of the Keonthul state is excused the payment of tribute. At a later period, Raen Gurh, which had been reserved by the British government as a military post, was made over to the ruler of Keonthul, in exchange for Simla. Kothkai, in consequence of long and irreclaimable misgovernment, was in 1828 annexed to the British dominions. The ruler of Ootrach or Turoch, from the like cause, but more than ten years later, incurred the penalty of confiscation, and the territory was incorporated with Joobul. The states now recognised as having a distinct existence, are the following:\u2014Bhagul, Beejah, Beejee, Bulsun, Bussahir, Dhamie, Dhorcatee, Ghurwal, Hindoor or Nalagurh, Joobul, Keyonthul,* Koomharsin, Koonyhar, Kothar, Kuhloor or Belaspore, Manee-Majra, Mangul, Muhlog, and Sirmoor Nahun. The area of the whole is 10,054 square miles; the entire population about 531,020. Each will be found noticed in its respective place under the alphabetical arrangement, as will also the portions of territory in these districts originally retained, or subsequently acquired by the British government.\n\nHIMALAYA.\u2014A vast assemblage of mountains, stretching in an irregularly curved line from the defile above Cashmere, on the north-west, through which the Indus penetrates into the plains of the Punjab, and separates the range from the mountains of Hindoo Koosh,\u2020 to the southern bend of the Sanpo or Dihong on the east previous to its junction with the Brahmapootra. This stupendous mass extends over 22\u00b0 of longitude, its western extremity lying in long. 73\u00b0 23', and its eastern in long. 95\u00b0 23'.\n\nIn so brief a sketch as necessity compels, it is impracticable\n\n* The following thakoraees or petty chieftainships are tributary to Keyonthul; viz., Poonder, Rain, Kootee, Goond, Madhan, and Theog.\n\n\u2020 Humboldt regards the Hindoo Koosh as altogether distinct from the Himalaya, and considers the distinction as not merely verbal but substantial, having reference to the origin of the two ranges.\nHIMALAYA.\n\nto go beyond an outline of the more noticeable facts of this remarkable region; and it is necessary to premise, that the view must be restricted in a great degree to the southern slope of the mountains, as that which constitutes the limit of India on the north. To extend inquiry to the Tibetan side, would exceed the proper bounds of the work; while, to carry research into the wide variety of subjects which might be introduced, as into the various branches of natural history, or into the habits, languages, history, and present circumstances of the inhabitants, would swell the article to a length disproportionate to the place which it should occupy in a book embracing so wide a field. Some information on these points will, moreover, be found under other heads; among which, the reader may be referred to the articles Kumaon, Gurwhal, and Bussahir. It would, however, be unjust to refrain in this place from noticing a very admirable, though short tract, by Dr. Hooker, \"On the Climate and Vegetation of the temperate and cold regions of East Nepal, and the Sikkim and Himalaya Mountains;\" in regard to meteorology and plants of the parts proposed to be illustrated, it is most valuable, and the more so, as it is the result of the personal observations of the learned author.\n\nAbout midway between the limits above defined, and in the vicinity of Lake Manasarowar, is the southern extremity of the mountain-range, which, extending from the north-west into Thibet, separates the drainage system of the Indus from that of the Sanpoo (afterwards the Brahmapootra), and is by some regarded as the grand central axis of Asia. From this centre the chain of the Himalayas stretches to nearly an equal distance in a north-westerly direction on the one hand, and a south-easterly on the other, throwing off at right angles lateral ranges sloping southward to the plains of India. Deep narrow valleys, separated from each other by these meridional ranges, contain the sources of the numerous rivers which constitute the drainage system of the Indus, the Ganges, and the Brahmapootra. Among the tributaries of the Indus, may be enumerated the Jhelum, Chenab, Beas, Ravee, and Sutlej; the principal feeders of the Ganges are the Jumna, Gogra, Gunduck, and Cosy: the Teesta and some others fall into the Brahmapootra. The elevation of the culminating range of the Him-\nHIMALAYA.\n\nlaya, observes Dr. Thomson, \"is probably at a mean about 18,000 or 20,000 feet; it is nearly uniform at about these elevations throughout a great part of the chain, but gradually diminishes toward both ends. Like all mountain-chains, it presents alternations of high and low portions, the lower parts or passes, as they are called, from their affording the means of passage to travellers from one side to the other, being at the upper extremities of the river basins. These passes are, with a few exceptions, rarely under 17,000 or 18,000 feet. The lateral chains, starting from the more elevated portions of the central axis between the passes, gradually diminish in elevation as they approach the plains of India, not, however, with any exact uniformity of progression; for it is not unfrequent to find them rise into lofty peaks, considerably more elevated than any known part of the central axis. The greater part of the giant peaks, which rise to an elevation of 26,000 or 28,000 feet, are situated in this manner, not on the central axis, but to the south of it.\"\n\nThe distribution of the Himalayas, by the authority just quoted, into two grand sections (the eastern and western), is calculated to exhibit with greater perspicuity the leading characteristics of each, and is obviously preferable to the distribution of Herbert, under which the chain is divided into three separate portions; the section designated the \"Indo-Gangetic range,\" and stretching from the source of the Sutlej, in Lake Manasarowar, to the vicinity of Ropur, on that river, in long. 76\u00b0 40', occupying the central position. A more recent traveller, whose researches extended to those regions, adopts the less complicated of the two arrangements, and in so doing advances additional arguments in its favour. The two sections, he contends, furnish points of resemblance, in presenting almost insurmountable obstacles to communication between the countries which they divide, and both marking\n\n* \"The great Himalaya, which bounds India to the north in one continuous chain of gigantic peaks from the southward bend of the Brahmapootra to the holy lake of Manasaravara, is extended to the westward from the sources of the Sutlej to the magnificent peaks of Dayamur, and thence to the sources of the Gilgit and Kunar rivers, where it joins the mountains of Pamur and Hindu Kush. The highest peaks in the Western Himalaya are Nanda Devi, 25,749 feet; Gyu peak, 24,764 feet; Monomangli, 23,900 feet; and Porgyal, 22,700 feet.\"\nthe boundaries of nations, by separating the Botis of Thibet from the Hindoo family of India. The distinction of climate he considers not less positively marked than that of nations; both ranges forming the \"lines of demarcation between the cold and dry climate of Thibet, with its dearth of trees, and the warm and humid climate of India, with its luxuriance of vegetable productions.\" Some analogy, moreover, may be traced between the drainage systems of the two sections; the one separating the waters of the Sanpo from those of the Ganges and its affluents, and the other intervening between the Indus, flowing at its northern base, and the subsequent tributaries of that river rising on its southern slope.\n\nMajor Cunningham, however, appears to be in error in supposing that the two divisions present points of contrast as well as of resemblance. \"There is,\" he observes, \"one marked difference between the eastern and western ranges, which can scarcely fail in striking the most casual observer. The inferior mountains of the eastern chain generally run at right angles to its axis; whereas those of the western chain are mostly disposed in subordinate parallel ranges.\" This marked difference, however, is not between the eastern and western divisions, but between two separate portions of the latter. The ramifications running \"at right angles\" to the axis, and the \"parallel ranges,\" are both comprised within the limits assigned by Major Cunningham to his western division; viz. from the sources of the Sutlej to the banks of the Indus. In allusion to a portion of this division, Captain Strachey observes: \"If we examine the structure of the mountains more closely, we shall find that from the sources of the Tonse to those of the Kali, a space which includes the provinces of Gurwhal and Kumaon, all the great rivers, the Bhagerati, Vishnugunga, Douli of Niti, Gori, Douli of Darma, and Kali, run in directions not far from perpendicular to the general direction of the Himalaya. Further, that they are separated one from another by great transverse ranges, on which all the highest of the measured peaks of this region are to be found.\" From these, moreover, proceeds an intricate ramification of subordinate ridges, giving to the whole area a most irregular and confused appearance. \"Even the Snowy chain,\" says Herbert, speaking of the Indo-Gangetic chain, \"though defined to a certain...\"\ndegree by a phenomenon so singular on a first view to the inhabitant of the plain country, loses on a nearer approach all character of continuity and regularity, and appears under the same confused and irregular aspect which the lower elevations are observed to bear.\"\n\nThe length of the western division of the culminating range of the Himalayas, from the source of the Sutlej to the peaks of Dayamur on the Indus (within which limits are comprised the Indo-Gangetic and the Bara Lacha ranges), is nearly 700 miles. The elevations of its summits are as under:\n\n| Peaks                  | Height |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| 1. Monomangli or Gurla | 23,900 |\n| 2. Kunlas Peak         | 22,518 |\n| 3.

Captain Strachey,\u2021 describing the character of the Indo-Gangetic chain, observes: \"Along the lines on which the points of greatest elevation are found in this part of the range, we invariably see, for a breadth of several miles, veins of granite in great abundance penetrating the schists, often cutting through them, but perhaps most frequently following the bedding of the strata, between which they seem to have been forced. The great peaks are, I think, in almost every case, composed of schistose rock, but the granite veins may be most clearly seen on the faces of the mountains to very great elevations. Kamet, one of the highest of the peaks in this\n\n* The line of perpetual congelation is placed by Herbert at a considerably lower altitude.\u2020 Ut supra, xxviii.\n\n\u2020 Ut supra, xxviii.\nHIMALAYA.\n\nregion, seems, however, to be among the exceptions to this rule; its summit, which is upwards of 25,500 feet above the sea, appearing to consist of granite alone. This line of granite seems to be subdivided into several branches, distributed generally along the strike, but otherwise not very regularly.\"\n\n\"In immediate succession to the crystalline schists penetrated by granite veins, we here come at once upon slaty beds overlying them, along the bottom of which, near the mica schists and gneiss, is a line of granite veins, differing somewhat in appearance from those of the larger eruption, and not producing any great alteration in the slaty beds themselves, as is shown by the occurrence of a coarse conglomerate, the component parts of which are perfectly distinct only a few feet above the granite.\"\n\n\"Above these are slaty beds, in all perhaps 9,000 feet in thickness, consisting of coarse slates, grits, and limestones, all more or less affected by slaty cleavage, and all devoid of fossil remains. It is after reaching the top of these strata, which is rarely done at a less elevation than 14,000 feet above the sea, that we at length enter again a region of fossiliferous rocks, which extends as far as my examinations have been carried. And it is not a little wonderful to find at this immense elevation a regular succession of most of the more important formations, from the silurian to the tertiary periods.\"\n\nThe length of the eastern section of the culminating range of the Himalayas, from the confluence of the Dihong with the Brahmapootra in the east, to the river Kalee, forming the boundary of Nepaul on the west, is about 800 miles. This portion supports the lofty peaks of Kinchinjunga and Dhwalagiri. Seen from Patna, observes Dr. Royle, \"at a distance of about 150 miles, these stupendous mountains present a long line of snow-white pinnacles, which, on a nearer approach, are seen towering above the dark line of lower but still lofty mountains.\" Dhwalagiri, having an elevation of 28,000 feet, is in lat. 29\u00b0 10', long. 83\u00b0. Two hundred miles eastward of this, and in lat. 28\u00b0 20', long. 86\u00b0, is situate the mountain of Gossainthan, attaining the height of 24,740 feet. After another interval*\n\n* It is generally believed that in this interval there are peaks more lofty than that of Gossainthan; one near Tingri Madan, about eighty miles\nof 140 miles in the same direction, the lofty peak of Kinchinjunga, probably the highest mountain in the world,* rises to the height of 28,176 feet.\u2020 This last-named mountain is in the north-east angle of Nepaul. Contiguous to Nepaul on the east, is the petty territory of Sikkim, speaking of which Dr. Hooker\u00a7 says:\u2014\u201cViewed from a distance on the plains of India, Sikkim presents the appearance\u2014common to all mountainous countries\u2014of consecutive parallel (wooded) ridges, running east and west, backed by a beautiful line of snowy peaks, with occasional breaks in the foremost ranges, through which the rivers debouch. Any view of the Himalaya, especially at a sufficient distance for the distant snowy peaks to be seen overtopping the outer ridges, is very rare, from the constant deposition of vapours over the forest-clad ranges during the greater part of the year, and the haziness of the dry atmosphere of the plains in the winter months. At the end of the rains, when the south-east monsoon has ceased to blow with constancy, views are obtained, sometimes from a distance of nearly 200 miles. The angle subtended by the giant peaks is so low (not a degree), that they appear like white specks very low on the horizon, tipping the black lower and outer wooded ranges, which always rest on a belt of haze, and from the density, probably, of the lower strata of atmosphere, are never seen to rest on the visible horizon. The remarkable lowness on the horizon of the whole stupendous mass is always a disappointing feature to the new comer, who expects to see dazzling peaks towering in the air. Approaching nearer, the snowy mountains sink behind the wooded ones long before the latter have assumed gigantic proportions, and when they increase in size, they appear a sombre, lurid grey-green mass of vegetation, with no brightness or variation of colour. There is no break in this forest caused by rock, precipice, or cultivation; some spurs project nearer, and some valleys appear to west of Kinchinjunga, is rumoured to rival the latter mountain in elevation.\n\n* The highest summits of the Andes\u00b9 are\u2014\n\nSorata, 25,267 ft. Illimani, 23,952 ft. Chimborazo, 21,440 ft.\n\nIt will be thus seen that the principal peak of the Himalayas overtops the principal summit of the Andes by above half a mile of perpendicular altitude.\n\n\u00b9 Cunningham, at supra, 41.\nHIMALAYA.\n\nretire further into the heart of the first great chain that shuts out all the country beyond. No pines whatever are seen on the outer range of Sikkim, both soil and climate being far too damp in the rainy season; nor are the colours of the foliage so varied and bright as the more perennially humid forests of tropical shores, from the want of any abundance of such palms as caryota, tall arec\u00e6, and of artocarpi, or of orange-groves.\" Beyond this, extensive tracts of the Himalayas remain unexplored, though it is known that a considerable portion of the Bootan territory, extending to long. 95\u00b0, presents a succession of lofty and rugged mountains, frequently rising to an altitude of 20,000 feet above the level of the sea, and covered with snow throughout the year.9\n\nThus it will be seen that the great Himalaya range, from its north-western extremity, where its continuity with the Hindoo Koosh is broken by the Indus, takes a south-easterly direction, giving rise in its course to the Jhelum, Chenaub, Ravee, and Beas rivers, after which it is penetrated* by the Sutlej, previous to its debouch into the plains near Roopur. Further east, it continues its original direction, throwing off in its progress the feeders of the Ganges, and also of the Braham-pootra subsequently to its confluence with the Sanpoo or Dihong. The entire chain may be said to have an average breadth1 of 150 miles; its length is computed at about 1,500.\n\n\"The noblest scenery in India,\" says Elphinstone,2 \"is under the Himalaya, where the ridges are broken into every form of the picturesque, with abrupt rocks, and slopes covered with gigantic pines and other trees, on the same vast scale, mixed with the most beautiful of our flowering shrubs, and the best of our fruits in a state of nature. Over the whole towers the majestic chain of the Himalayas, covered with eternal snow, a sight which the soberest traveller has never described without kindling into enthusiasm, and which, if once seen, leaves an impression that can never be equalled or effaced.\"\n\n* Dr. Thompson1 says, \"The most marked of these peculiarities may be observed in the course of the Sutlej, which runs, for a very considerable part of its course, nearly parallel to the Indus, before it turns towards the plains; thus separating the western division of the Himalayas chain, almost from its very origin, into two branches.\"\n\n---\n\n1 Thompson, ut supra, 2.\n2 History of India, l. 350.\n3 It supra, 3.\nHIM\u2014HIN.\n\nHIMMUTGUNGE,\\(^1\\) in the British district of Allahabad, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a village on the route from the cantonment of Allahabad to Jubbulpore, and four\\(^2\\) miles S. of the former.

After a course generally southerly of about 160 miles, it falls into the Jumna on the left side, in lat. 28\u00b0 27', long. 77\u00b0 30'. It is crossed by the route from Dehra to Saharanpoor, in lat. 29\u00b0 58', long. 77\u00b0 43', and is there fordable during the dry season. It is also crossed by the route from Kurnoul to Mozuffernuggur, in lat. 29\u00b0 22', long. 77\u00b0 33', and is there fordable, except when swollen during the rains; by the route from Kurnoul to Meerut, in lat. 29\u00b0 12', long. 77\u00b0 34', and is there fordable, with a depth of from two to two and a half feet; and by the route from Meerut to Saharanpoor, in lat. 29\u00b0 53', long. 77\u00b0 40', and is there crossed by a bridge and long causeway.\n\nHINDOOR, or NALAGURH. \u2014 A hill state at the south-western declivity of the Himalaya Mountains. It is bounded on the north by Kuhloor; on the east by Bhagul and Muhlog; on the south and west by Sirhind. It contains an area of 233 square miles, the centre being in lat. 31\u00b0 7', long. 76\u00b0 50'. It is traversed throughout its whole extent by a steep range of hills, which, rising over the left bank of the Sutlej, continues in a south-easterly direction until joining the Sub-Himalaya near Subathoo. Parts of this ridge attain a considerable height; Chumbagarh being 4,400, and Ramgarh 4,054 feet above the sea. The drainage is either by the rivers Gumbur and Gunrora, which flow in a north-westerly direction to the Sutlej, or by the Sarsa, which, rising in the Pinjor Doon, takes also a north-westerly direction, and falls into the Sutlej near Kanoli, after a course of about thirty miles. Moorcroft speaks of part of the country thus traversed in favourable terms:\u2014\u201cThe valley of the Gamrora is populous and well cultivated. Along the courses of the different small streams by which it is intersected are rows of pear-trees, which, at the time we passed them, were in full blossom. Villages occurred repeatedly on either side of the road.\u201d The Sursa receives several small streams from the north and north-east: of these the most worth notice are the Baladh and the Ruta. The Lohund and the Kalakund, two small rivers, flow down the mountain-tract sloping to the north-west, and fall into the Sutlej. The low grounds on the banks of the Sursa and Sutlej are alluvial, fertile, and, being\nlittle more than 1,000 feet above the sea, have a climate and produce resembling those of intertropical regions. The crops are generally maize, rice, wheat, barley, various kinds of millet, cotton, opium, ginger, turmeric, hemp, tobacco, oil-seeds, and esculent vegetables. The fruits are pomegranates, peaches, apricots, plums, apples, pears, walnuts, raspberries, strawberries, and melons. The pulp of the pomegranates is eaten; the husks are dried, and exported for the purposes of dyeing and tanning. The acacia, Indian fig, pine, elm, willow, gentian, geranium, rose, and other shrubs familiar in Europe, adorn the hills. The country is altogether picturesque, beautiful, fertile, well watered, and highly cultivated. The only places of importance are Nalagarh, Ramgarh, and Plassi or Palasi. Nalagarh is at present the residence of the rajah, in place of Plassi, at which he formerly dwelt. The population of the raj is estimated by Moorcroft at 20,000. It is represented to contain 136 villages, and to yield an annual revenue of 10,000l.; but according to official report of a recent date (1848), the revenue does not exceed 8,000l. The thakoree of Burrowlee, with the exception of a small part, was conferred on the rajah of Hindoor, in November, 1815, in lieu of the fort of Malown, with six villages, retained as a post for British troops. The rajah holds under the East-India Company, from whom he received his raj on the expulsion of the Goorkhas in 1815; and in troublous times his conduct has been characterized by his devotion to British interests.\n\nHINDOSTAN.\u2014See INDIA.\n\nHINDOUL, in the British district of Muttra, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a village on the route from the cantonment of Meerut to that of Muttra, and 17 miles N.E. of the latter.

It is surrounded by a deep ravine 200 feet deep, 250 wide, and with perpendicular sides, from the edge of which the walls rise, and is accessible only by three causeways, made to form communications across the chasm, with three gates respectively. It was, however, stormed July 3rd, 1804, by a British detachment sent by Colonel Monson, stationed at Sunara, ten miles farther east. The detachment, commanded by Major Sinclair, consisted of a battalion of a native regiment, with six six-pounders and a party of irregular horse. After battering for an hour, the British escaladed the walls, and took the place with little loss, not a British officer being either killed or wounded. It was subsequently restored to Holkar, apparently in conformity to the declaratory article annexed to the treaty of Rajpurghat, 1805. Distant from Indor, N., 130 miles; from Oojein, N., 100.

Lat. 27\u00b0 13', long. 81\u00b0 39'.\n\nHISSAR.\u2014The principal place of the pergunnah of the same name, in the British district of Hurrecanah, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a town on the route from the city of Delhi to Bhutneer. It is situate on the branch made by Feroz Shah from the Delhi Canal to supply water for irrigation, as well as for the use of the numerous host of followers brought by him into this arid tract, which was his favourite hunting-ground; the neighbouring wastes harbouring lions and tigers, besides other wild beasts less formidable. This watercourse appears to have been partly made by excavation, partly by clearing the channel of the Chitang, or one of its branches. In 1825 it was, by order of the British government, cleared out as far as Darbah, twenty-five miles north-west of Hissar, to which last place it is navigable for timber-rafts. Previously to this renovation, the town and its vicinity suffered much from want of water, being supplied merely from tanks or from wells, of which last it had 800 in the time of George Thomas. There is a well-supplied bazar, and formerly the East-India Company had here a stud, to furnish a supply of horses for the army; but in 1844 the establishment ceased. The place was likewise selected as the site of a farm for rearing cattle for the ordnance department; but this establishment also has been recently abolished. In the time of Akbar, Hissar had two forts, one of stone, the other of brick. The sircar, of which it was the principal place, was\n\n* Properly Hisar, \"the citadel;\" called in the translation of Ferishta \"Hisar Feroza;\" in the Ayeen Akbery, \"Hisar Feerozeh,\" in consequence of having been built (1356) by Feroz Shah of Delhi.\n\n\u2020 Hamilton says, \"The palace of Sultan Feroze stands in what was the centre of the city, and has very extensive subterranean apartments. Close to the palace is an iron pillar, rather less than that at Joobnt, near Delhi, called Feroze Shah's Lath.\" A more detailed description of this pillar is given by Brown, who considers it a Buddhist relic, on which Feroz Shah made some alterations and inscriptions; whence it is traditionally called the lath, club, or obelisk of that monarch:\u2014\"The ancient stone forming the base of Feroz's pillar at Hissar, is of one piece, and is ten feet ten inches high. How much of it is sunk in the ground below, I cannot tell; but probably there is as much of it below as above, and some of the\nrated to furnish 6,875 cavalry, 55,700 infantry, and an annual revenue of 18,75,022 rupees. The road to the east is good; to the west it is in many places good, but occasionally heavy. Distant N.W. from Delhi 104 miles; N.W. from Calcutta 991 miles.

It has a small bazar: the road in this part of the route is in general good, though in some places not free from swamps, the country being low and marshy. Distance from Calcutta, N.E., 28 miles; from Dacca, S.W., 158. Lat. 22\u00b0 52', long. 88\u00b0 41'.\n\nHOCHO, or HOPCHO, in Bussahir, a stream of Koonawur, rises near the north-eastern frontier, in lat. 81\u00b0 38', long. 78\u00b0 48', on the western declivity of the Gantung Pass, from the melted snows of which it is supplied. Even near the source, it ancient inscriptions may still be preserved on the lower parts. The greatest circumference of the stone above ground is eight and a half feet. The rest of the pillar is of the red sandstone common at Agra, and there is part of the column, near the second cornice, made of coarse white marble. There is a massive iron rod on the top, which formerly served to support a cupola. Several attempts have been made to extract this rod by the natives, but they have always failed. From the base of the column to the top of this rod, the height is about forty-five feet. The column is solid, and there is no way of easily getting to the top.\" The pillar is situate in the middle of a square of old buildings, at present used as a magazine. In one of them is the entrance to a subterraneous passage, stated by the natives to extend to Hansee, a distance of fifteen miles, and which was explored by Brown, until the lights that he used went out. The inscriptions do not appear as yet to have been deciphered; the character is considered to resemble English capitals rather than any Indian letters. There is another building, which, according to tradition, was intended to represent the model of a ship, and made by order of Feroz Shah, who having never seen one, and being unable to understand the account given by an officer who attempted a description, caused him to raise this singular structure to aid the explanation. It is, however, as might be expected, very unlike any ship at present known.\n\n* The Yurpo of Jacquemont.\n\n1 Garden, Tables of Routes, 142, 193.\n2 Garden, Tables of Routes, 91.\n3 Lloyd and Gerard, Tours in Himalaya, ii. 184.\n4 Voyage, iv. 304.\nin some places spreads to a width of 100 yards, and in one part to 200, in another to 300; but is so shallow as scarcely to cover the pebbles in its bed.

It is situate on the north side of an extensive estuary, or rather inlet, of the sea, forming an expanse of salt-water, which at its south-eastern extremity receives the Gairsoppa or Sheravutty, a considerable river flowing from the Western Ghats, farther eastward. This salt-water lake is about seven miles in length from south-east to north-west, and three in its greatest breadth; has an area of about fifteen square miles, and contains several islands. Though not a good haven, it can receive large ships; and Hyder Ali, sultan of Mysore, here established a dock for building ships of war, some of which were sunk by the British when they took the place, and their wrecks were for a long time visible. The best station for shipping is, however, the road outside the mouth of the haven, and sheltered by two small islands, called Baswaraje Droog and Fortified Island. The depth of water is five or six fathoms, and the ground is soft; but as a station for shipping, it is disadvantageous for the greater part of the year, as fresh water is very scarce, the lake or haven being salt, except during the monsoon, when the quantity of water discharged into it by the Sheravutty and many other streams makes it quite fresh. It abounds in fish, great quantities of which are taken, and make an article of commerce.

This port was formerly a place of great commerce, and still has a trade in pepper, cocoanuts, betelnut, fish, and some other articles, especially the fragrant sandal-wood, which grows in great abundance and perfection on the rocky hills of the country, and is in great demand, more particularly in China, where it is burned, to produce a perfume, before venerated images and shrines.\n\nOf this place there is but little notice before 1569,\\(^5\\) when it was a rich and beautiful city, with a fort, belonging to the queen of Gairsoppa, a city now in ruins, about fifteen miles farther east, on the river Sheravutty, and was plundered and burned by the Portuguese, who shortly after fortified and garrisoned\\(^6\\) it. On the decay of the Portuguese power in India, it was acquired by the sovereigns of Bednore, on the conquest of which place by Hyder Ali, this town also submitted\\(^7\\) to him. In 1783\\(^8\\) it was taken by assault by a British force, despatched from Bombay under the command of General Matthews,\\(^9\\) and, in 1784, obstinately and successfully defended\\(^1\\) by Captain Torriano, against Tippoo Sultan; to whom, however, in the same year, it was ceded by the treaty of Mangalore.\\(^2\\) On the overthrow of that prince in 1798, it again came into the possession of the East-India Company.

Though ill-built, it is a thriving place, and has some considerable trade, being one of the principal cotton marts of the Southern Mahratta country. In this respect its importance will probably increase, from the improved means of communication with the coast. A cart-road from Dharwar to\nHOO.\n\nHooblee was completed some years ago. In 1847 a further continuation of this road was authorized to Wuddeguttee, on the Canara frontier, there to meet the road constructed by the Madras government for facilitating the inland trade between Dharwar and the port of Coompta. The average load of cotton for a bullock is 280 pounds. The average hire of a bullock from Hooblee to the port of Coompta, a distance of 120 miles, is three rupees; making the cost of conveyance six rupees per candy of 560 pounds. The average load for a cart drawn by two bullocks is 1,120 pounds. The same number of animals, therefore, employed in draught will draw twice the amount of goods by weight which they would carry in the way of burden.\n\nTwo of the government vernacular schools are established in this town; one Mahratta, one Canarese.\n\nHooblee was formerly the seat of an English factory, which, in 1673, was, with the rest of the town, plundered by Sevajee, the Mahratta leader, to the amount of 7,894 pagodas. Moazzim, son of Aurungzebe, sent by his father into this country at the head of an army, took Hooblee. During the decline of the kingdom of Delhi, the town fell into the hands of the Mahrattas, and on the overthrow of the Peishwa, in 1818, was, with the rest of that prince's dominions, taken possession of by the government of the East-India Company. Its population is estimated at 15,000. Distance from Bombay, S.E., 290 miles; from Poona, S.E., 230 miles.

It is bounded on the north by the British district of Burdwan; on the east by the river Hooghly, separating it from the British districts of Nuddea, Baraset, and the Twenty-four Pergunnahs; on the south by the river Roopnarain, separating it from the British districts of Midnapore and Hidjelee; and on the west by the British districts Midnapore and Burdwan. It lies between lat. 22\u00b0 13'\u201423\u00b0 13', long. 87\u00b0 34'\u201488\u00b0 30'; is seventy-two miles in length from north to south, and fifty-two in breadth. The area, according to official return,\u00b2 is 2,089 square miles. In its general aspect, the district is low and level in the\n\n\u00b9 E.I.O. Ms. Doc.\n\u00b2 Statistics of British Possessions.\nHOOGHLY.\n\neastern part, but more hilly in the western and north-western, where it runs towards the high lands of Burdwan. The river Hooghly touches on the district at its north-east corner, in lat. $23^\\circ 12'$, long. $88^\\circ 22'$, and, flowing southward, forms its eastern boundary towards the British districts Nuddea, Baraset, and the Twenty-four Pergunnahs, for forty miles, as far as Balee, in lat. $22^\\circ 40'$, long. $88^\\circ 25'$, where it passes into the Twenty-four Pergunnahs, on issuing from which, it again, at Fort Gloster, in lat. $22^\\circ 28'$, long. $88^\\circ 12'$, touches on the Hooghly district, and flows along its eastern frontier, dividing it from the Twenty-four Pergunnahs for twenty-five miles, to the confluence of the Roopnarain, at the southern extremity of the district, in lat. $22^\\circ 12'$, long. $88^\\circ 5'$. About ten miles above this confluence, it on the right or west side receives the Damoodah, which, proceeding from the high lands of Burdwan in a direction south-east, enters the district at the north-west corner, in lat. $22^\\circ 56'$, long. $87^\\circ 57'$, and flows throughout it in a direction nearly south for fifty-five miles, to its junction with the Hooghly. In the dry season, the Damoodah is fordable in many places, but when inundated by the periodical rains, at the close of summer and the commencement of autumn, becomes a vast torrent, ninety feet in depth and 1,000 feet in width, sometimes bursting the bunds or embankments with which it is inclosed, rushing with prodigious noise over the country, and sweeping away, in indiscriminate ruin, houses and their inmates, the crops and cattle. The Dalkissore touches on the northern boundary of the district, in lat. $23^\\circ 2'$, long. $87^\\circ 57'$, and, traversing it in a southerly direction for thirty miles, becomes at the end of that distance its boundary towards Midnapore for fourteen miles. Subsequently re-entering the district, it forms its boundary towards Hijellee, and falls into the Ganges in lat. $22^\\circ 12'$, long. $88^\\circ 7'$.\n\nThere are many other watercourses and torrents of less note, but of considerable size during the periodical rains, when the country is overflowed to a great extent. The dry, hot season lasts from the beginning of March to the end of June, during which interval the thermometer ranges from $75^\\circ$ to $110^\\circ$. The periodical rains set in at the end of June, and last until the end of September or the early part of October. During this period the country is very unhealthy, fevers and\nHOOGHLY.\n\nagues being especially rife. The cool season lasts from the beginning of November to the end of January, and in the nights ice\\(^4\\) is sometimes formed to such an extent, that masses may, with due precautions, be preserved to be used during the hot season. February is cool and very pleasant, and is hailed with as high feelings of gratification by the natives, as the finest part of spring is welcomed in Europe.\n\nAccording to a recent publication,\\(^5\\) there are a few deer and wild hogs; but \"elephants, tigers, wolves, and buffaloes, are not indigenous\\(^*\\) to this district, though now and then met with.\"\n\nThe soil in the south, in some places, is much impregnated with common culinary salt, which was formerly extracted on account of government. Along the courses of the rivers, and generally in the low grounds, it is very fertile, and as irrigation is easily practised, it produces abundant crops of fine rice.\n\nThe trees most generally to be met with, are the mango, jak (Artocarpus integrifolia), cocoanut-palm and date-palm, tamarind, guava, lime-tree, orange-tree, and betel-palm. Lately, considerable efforts have been successfully made to introduce various new kinds of trees and plants from the botanic garden at Calcutta.\n\nBesides rice, the principal objects of cultivation are the sugarcane, indigo, the mulberry-tree (for the sake of its leaves to feed silkworms), cotton, tobacco, mustard and other oil-seeds, ginger, hemp, potatoes, cucurbitaceous plants of various kinds, peas, onions, cabbages, and various other esculent vegetables. The principal exports are raw silk, indigo, and sugar. A large quantity of plantains is also sent to the Calcutta market, and distillation of rum is greatly increasing, in consequence of the brisk demand for it in the British market. Spirits are distilled in considerable quantities from the sap of the date-palm, and palmyra or toddy-palm. Large quantities of bamboos find a ready sale in the Calcutta market. Hemp is made into ropes, sacking, and coarse canvas. Formerly there was a considerable manufacture of cotton cloths, but the greater cheapness of the fabrics brought from Great Britain\n\n\\(^*\\) Hamilton, however, remarks,\\(^1\\) \"It is surprising how large a proportion of its surface [that of Hooghly] still remains in a state of nature, the asylum of tigers.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) Gazetteer, i. 663.\nHOOGHLY.\n\nhas nearly put an end to that branch of industry in this district, as well as in other parts of India.\n\nThe population, according to official statement, is 1,520,840, an amount which, compared with the area, indicates an extraordinary relative density of 728 to the square mile; and it is, notwithstanding, considered that the numbers of the people are steadily on the increase. They consist of Brahminists, Mussulmans, and Christians; and amongst them, according to a rough estimate, the Brahminists form two-thirds. Of the residue, the Mussulmans are by far the most numerous, though the professors of Christianity constitute a portion relatively greater than is usual in India. In a recent publication, it is observed, that \"they may be divided into three classes: 1. Europeans, including government functionaries; 2. East Indians, or descendants of Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French, by native mothers; 3. native Christians. The Europeans out of the service of government are very few. The English and French planters and their assistants would hardly amount to a score of persons.\"\n\nThe French settlement of Chandernagore is situate within the limits of this district, as are also Chinsura and Serampore, now British possessions, but originally belonging, the one to the Dutch, and the other to the Danes. Hooghly, the principal place, Ampata or Omptah, Boenchie, Jehanabad, Shahbazar, Ghotal, Keerpoy, and the places just mentioned as now or lately held by foreign powers, are described under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe principal routes are,\u20141. From south-east to north-west, from Calcutta through the town of Hooghly to Burdwan; 2. from south-east to north-west, from Calcutta through Jehanabad to Bancoora; 3. from north to south, along the right side of the river Hooghly; 4. from north-east to south-west, from Burdwan to Midnapore; 5. from east to west, from Calcutta to Midnapore.\n\nThe tract comprised within the present district of Hooghly, appears, according to the remotest historical records, to have formed part of a considerable realm, called Tamaralipta, from its capital of that name, identical with the modern Tumlook. It is reputed to have maintained, or aspired to maintain, extensive foreign relations, and it is said, that in the year 1001, the\nHOOGHLY.\n\nking despatched an ambassador to the monarch of China. At the time of the invasion of Bengal\\(^1\\) by the Mussulmans, at the commencement of the thirteenth century, the tract was comprised within the dominions of a rajah residing at Nuddea, on the Bhagirathi, north of the present district of Hooghly. This feeble chief, without an attempt at resistance, deserted his dominions, which were seized by Bukhtyar Khulijy, the Musulman general, and subsequently incorporated with the state which he founded, and styled the kingdom of Bengal. It was probably united to the kingdom of Delhi by the renowned Sher Shah, when, in 1542,\\(^2\\) he took the city of Gour, and overthrew the kingdom of Bengal. Wrested from Delhi during the troubles ensuing on the death of Sher Shah, it was reunited to it in 1576, by Khan Jehan, an officer of Akbar. At the commencement of the eighteenth century, it became\\(^3\\) part of the virtually independent state which, under the denomination of the soobah of Bengal, was founded by Murshid Kuli Khan, during the weakness and distractions of the kingdom of Delhi, ensuing on the death of Aurungzebe. The right of the East-India Company to this tract originated in the treaty concluded with Meer Cossim in 1760, and was confirmed in 1765, by the emperor Shah\\(^4\\) Allum.\n\nHOOGHLY.\\(^1*\\)\u2014The principal place of the British district of the same name, a town on the line of railroad now under construction from Calcutta to Benares. It is situate on the right bank of the great offset of the Ganges, from it denominated the Hoogly. The river in this part is much contracted\\(^2\\) in breadth. The civil establishment of the district located here is accommodated in several buildings,\\(^3\\) of striking appearance, in the Grecian style of architecture, but of frail beauty, being merely overlaid with chunam or stucco. The church, built by the Jesuits, according to the inscribed date, 1599, is a large fine structure, of such durable materials as to appear to have been but recently erected. Here is a college, erected in 1836, upon a site granted for the purpose by the government,\\(^4\\) and supported by funds derived from the estate of Haji Muhammad Mohsin.\\(^5\\) Instruction is given both in English and Oriental literature.

Besides these, there is a considerable number of native functionaries, of various grades and denominations. This town is conjectured to have been founded by the Portuguese in 1537. In 1632, it was, after an obstinate defence of three months, stormed by the troops of Shahjehan, 1,000 Portuguese being slaughtered, and 4,400 taken prisoners. Sixty-four large vessels, and 254 of smaller dimensions, were burned, three only escaping to Goa. The place, thus possessed by the Moguls, became the royal port of Bengal. In 1676, the English established a factory here, and about the same time Tavernier mentions a similar establishment belonging to the Dutch. In 1681, the English factory was fortified, and provided with a small guard, consisting of twenty Europeans, which was the first military establishment of the Company in Bengal. Subsequently wrested from the Company by Sooraj-oo-dowlah, it was, in 1757, retaken by Clive, and has from that time been retained. The population of the town is estimated at about 12,000.\n\nDistance N. from Calcutta 27 miles; from Benares, S.E., 394 Lat. 22\u00b0 54', long. 88\u00b0 22'.\n\nHOOGHLY.\u2014A large river of Bengal, formed by the junction of two great branches of the Ganges, the Bhagrattee and the Jellinghee, the confluence of which is in lat. 23\u00b0 25', long. 88\u00b0 22', and 125 miles from the sea, reckoned by the windings of the stream to Diamond Point, or, if the estuary be included, as far as Saugor Roads, 160 miles. Its mean breadth above Calcutta is three-quarters of a mile, and it was formerly navigable for ships of the line as high as Chandernagore, 115 miles from Saugor Roads, and seventeen above Calcutta. There is indeed a rumour, pretty generally credited, that the river is gradually silting up, and will at some future time cease to afford adequate accommodation to the trade of the capital of British India. This would be a fearful blow to the prosperity of the \"City of palaces,\" unless a suitable remedy should be provided. Towards this end, it has been suggested that either\nHOOGHLY.\n\na ship canal or a railway might be constructed from Calcutta to the Mutwal, a river some distance to the eastward, not unfitted to become the successor of the Hooghly, should it be necessary to abandon that channel; and thus the commerce of the maritime emporium of Bengal be retained. However, \"the draught\" of water for ships departing from Calcutta to proceed down the river, is usually limited to seventeen feet, but the pilots will, for a gratuity presented to them, sometimes take charge of vessels drawing seventeen and a half or eighteen feet; and if a powerful steam-tug be employed, they may be taken from Calcutta drawing nineteen or even twenty feet, when the tides and weather are favourable.\" When the river is not affected by the annual periodical inundations, which take place at the close of summer, the water is slightly salt at Calcutta, but \"in September\" the freshes are at their height; there is then no visible tide off Calcutta, the ships do not swing up, and the river-water is perfectly sweet, far beyond Saugor, in the open sea.\" The following general summary of the variations of the tides of the Hooghly is given by the writer just quoted:\u2014\"From the point of lowest low water in the dry season, to that of the highest high water in the freshes, is twenty feet ten inches. The greatest mean rise of tide from low to high water-mark takes place in March, April, and May, and is fifteen feet ten inches. The greatest mean rise of tide from low to high water-mark in the freshes is ten feet. The smallest mean rise of tide takes place in the freshes, and is at neap tides only three feet six inches. The smallest mean rise of the tide in the dry season, neap tides, is four feet. From the lowest fall of the river to high water-mark, neap tides, in February, is eight feet. From the lowest fall of the river to low water in the freshes, neap tides, is twelve feet.* The river is at its lowest in the beginning of March. The river is swollen by the freshes in July, August, and September, and part of October. The freshes take off about the middle of September, and are generally out of the river by the end of October. At the beginning of November, although the freshes\n\n* During the inundation in September, 1823, the low water stood at eighteen feet six inches, the tide having ebbed only fifteen inches on that day. The difference between this low water and the high water (neap tides in February, viz. eight feet) is ten feet six inches.\nHOOGHLY.\n\nare out of the river, it is upwards of three feet higher at low water than in March. The river is in the most quiescent state during the months of November, December, January, and February. During these months, the night tides are higher and more rapid than the day tides; and there are, on some occasions, bores at night. The strongest flood tides, and the greatest mean rise of the tides, are in March, April, May, and June. The day tides in these months are higher than the night tides. The strongest freshes are in September. In July, the strength of the flood tides is counteracted by the freshes, and this, therefore, is a moderate month as regards tides. The bores also are moderated, as a consequence. In August, the flood tides are overcome by the freshes, and the bores are moderate: should there be a high parallax of the moon, however, the great height of the sea in this month will cause a considerable bore.\" Though not a mile* wide at Calcutta, the river does not at all times afford perfect security to ships, as there have been instances of their being blown ashore there in violent storms. The river has little increase of breadth until after it has received the waters of the Damoodah and Rupnarain, and passed Diamond Point, fifty miles from Calcutta. Below that point, it rapidly expands, and at Saugor Roads, where the estuary terminates in the open sea, it is about fifteen miles wide. The tides, under circumstances calculated to favour their action, are violent and rapid, running sometimes at the rate of seven\u00b9 miles an hour near Calcutta; and in the southwest monsoon, when a great current is driven into the river from the Bay of Bengal, the extraordinary phenomenon denominated the Bore, which sometimes rises on the sands contiguous to the banks in waves twelve or fifteen feet perpendicular, rushes on at the rate of twenty\u00b2 miles an hour, carrying every floating body along with it. The Hooghly, though the only channel of the Ganges frequented by large ships, is at its mouth much encumbered by shoals, amidst which ships can be steered safely only by much skill and attention. Of the channels between those shoals, the principal\u00b3 are\u20141. The Inside Channel, farthest west, stretching from Balasor close along the shore inside, or to the north-westward of all the\n\n\u00b9 Id. l. 638.\n\u00b2 Id. l. 617, et seq.\n\u00b3 Narrat. of Journ. l. 28.\n\n* According to Heber,\u00b9 \"at least twice as wide as the Thames below London Bridge.\"\nHOO.\n\nshoals, with depths generally of from two to three fathoms at low water. This is used only by the small coasting vessels navigated by the natives. 2. Fairway, or the Western Channel, suitable only for ships drawing not more than fourteen or fifteen feet of water. 3. Middle Channel, which is narrow, has not more than three fathoms of water, and is little used. 4. Sagar Channel, or Eastern Channel: this is represented as at present the channel in general use by ships entering or departing from the Hooghly. 5. Thornhill Channel, which has two fathoms and three-quarters at low tide, but commonly three, three and a quarter, or three and a half. 6. The Old Channel, having from three to four fathoms at low water. 7. Lacam Channel, or Channels Creek, called by the natives Baratulla, separates Saugor island and Clive's Island from the lowland of the Sunderbunds. It has a good depth of water, but is rendered somewhat intricate by sands projecting from the land. If these, however, were marked by buoys or beacons, the navigation would not be difficult. Several ships at different times have entered it by mistake, and passed in safety.\n\nThe Hooghly is considered by the Brahminists as the real and much-venerated Ganges, having its source at Gangoutri; and the Podda, which takes its course farther east, though having a much larger volume of water, is regarded as a mere branch. The banks of the Hooghly are studded with numerous towns and villages, many of which possess an interest, \"from old associations, or have been rendered memorable by historical recollections.\"\n\nHOOKEO.\u2014A pass over a lofty range of mountains on the north-eastern frontier of Koonawur, and bounding the table-land of Chinese Tartary westward, and which here has a surface of reddish gravel, swelling into gentle slopes.

No regular survey has been made, but its area is estimated at 1,916\u00b2 square miles. The total amount of the population, according to a recent census, is 242,641; but no distinctions of creed, caste, or occupation, were noticed. An attempt was made to supply this deficiency by conjectural means, under which operation the people were thus distributed:\u2014Hindoos,\u00b3 agricultural, 108,468; non-agricultural, 122,685; Mahomedans and others, not Hindoos, agricultural, 654; non-agricultural, 10,834. These proportions derive plausibility from the results of a former census, which probably furnished the chief ground for their assumption, but the total only can be entirely relied on.\n\nThis district is so remarkable for fertility, as to be commonly styled\u2074 the garden of Central India. It possesses also one of the elements of mineral wealth, in coal of excellent quality, and it is believed in abundant quantity. On a comparison with some\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.\n\u00b2 Mem.

The great distance of the beds from the coast is, however, at present a serious impediment to its being brought extensively into use.\n\nHOSHUNGABAD.\u2014The principal place of the British district of the same name. It is situate on the left or south bank of the river Nerbudda, stated to be here 900 yards wide, and subject, during the periodical rains, to rise to such an extent as to cause very considerable inundations. Here is a fort, of quadrangular ground-plan, and having high walls. The town is irregularly built, and the houses being much dispersed, the population is not dense. The river is not fordable opposite the town, the water at the shallowest part, even in the season when lowest, being between five and six feet deep, and flowing over an irregular rocky bottom. It is infested with alligators, both of the long-snouted and bull-mouthed kinds. There are thirteen ghats or fords over the river, within twelve or fourteen miles of Hoshungabad, becoming passable in the beginning of winter, and continuing so until spring advances. That nearest the town was found, when the water was lowest, to be covered three feet deep. East of the town is a small cantonment of British troops belonging to the Saugor division, and the town itself is the seat of a political agency subsidiary to that of Saugor.\n\nHoshungabad was founded about the year 1433 by Hoshung Shah, sovereign of Malwa, whose remains were deposited there, but subsequently removed to Mandoo. In 1562 it was, with the rest of Malwa, conquered by Akbar. On the dismemberment of the empire of Delhi, Hoshungabad was appropriated by the nawaub of Bhopal, from whom it was taken by storm by the rajah of Nagpore or Berar, in 1796. It was, however, soon after retaken by the ruler of Bhopal, and again, in 1807, taken by the rajah of Nagpore, by whom it was ceded, in 1818, to the British government.

Its position has often rendered it the object of obstinate contention between the powers of Mysore and the Carnatic. In 1654, it was taken by the rajah of Mysore; in 1768, it fell into the hands of the British: after various vicissitudes, it returned to the possession of Mysore, but was occupied by the British in 1791, on the advance of Lord Cornwallis against Seringapatam.

It is described by Heber\u00b2 as a considerable place, chiefly inhabited by ship-builders, but containing some pretty villas. The Hooghly, nearly a mile wide, is covered with large ships and craft of all kinds. The town has been selected as the site for the terminus of the railroad from Calcutta to the North-West Provinces.

It has been traced downwards from Hoja Jamote,\u00b2 on the northern boundary of Lus, in lat. 26\u00b0 12', long. 66\u00b0 51', and is supposed to rise near that place. For about twenty-five miles in the upper part of its course, it flows south-easterly, and then turning due south, holds its way for about fifty miles in that direction. It then turns to the south-west, and, after a total length of 100 miles, falls into the Arabian Sea, on the north side of Cape Monze, in lat. 24\u00b0 54', long. 68\u00b0 43'. De la Hoste\u00b3 states, that for a distance of fourteen miles from the mouth, water was in the end of summer found to the depth of eight inches, and that in some places deep pools exist, abounding in fish and alligators. He adds, that the river is said never to fail in the driest seasons. Masson,\u2074 however, states, that it is only on extraordinary occasions that the water of the Hubb reaches the sea; and in this he is supported by Hart,\u2075 who crossed it about fifteen miles above the mouth, where the channel was 100 yards wide. Though, in consequence of heavy rains, there was then a large body of running water, he found but a small stream on his return a short time after, and was informed it would soon cease to flow, and that water would then be found only in detached pools. The whole course is described as a succession of rocky or gravelly gorges in the rugged and barren Pubb Mountains.\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms Doc.

The Hujamree mouth is wide, but rapidly narrows inland to about 500 yards: at Vikkur, twenty miles from the sea, it is only about 170 yards wide; and still higher up, near its junction with the Sata, its breadth is found not to exceed fifty yards. In 1831 it was navigable for boats from the sea to the entrance into the Sata, as the small flotilla which conveyed Captain Burnes and his party in that year passed this way. According to the statement of that officer,\u00b2 there were then fifteen feet of water on the bar at high tide, and a depth of four fathoms all the way to Vikkur. He observes, however, adverting to the changing character of the river, \u201cThe next season perhaps Vikkur will be deserted.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 Carless, Official Survey of the Indus, 4.\nBurnes, iii. 36, 37, 286.\nId.

Lat. $30^\\circ 57'$, long. $78^\\circ 46'$.\n\nHUMEERPOOR. \u2014 A British district under the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces, deriving its name from its principal town, and forming, with Calpee, a collectorate. The united territory is bounded on the north-east by the river Jumna, dividing it from the British districts Etawa, Cawnpore, and Futtehpore; on the east and south-east by the British district of Banda; on the south by the native states of Churkaree and Chutterpore; and on the west by the territories of Jhansi and the British district of Jaloun. It lies between lat. $25^\\circ 7'$\u2014$26^\\circ 26'$, long. $79^\\circ 20'$\u2014$80^\\circ 25'$, and has an area of about 2,240 square miles. The district is generally a plain, rising imperceptibly as it recedes southwards from the Jumna to the Bindachal and Punna ranges of mountains. Hence the streams hold generally a north-easterly or easterly direction, and discharge themselves into the Jumna, which touches on the district in lat. $26^\\circ 23'$, long. $79^\\circ 28'$, and, pursuing a course for the most part south-easterly, forms for fifteen miles the dividing line between this and the British district Etawa; for eighty-four miles farther, that between this and the British district Cawnpore; and for eight miles more, it divides this district from the British district of Futtehpore. In lat. $25^\\circ 54'$, long. $80^\\circ 25'$, the river ceases to be connected with the district. For the 107 miles that it forms the boundary, it is navigable during the rainy season for boats of considerable size. The Betwa, touching on this district in lat. $25^\\circ 48'$, long. $79^\\circ 28'$, and flowing generally eastward, forms, with slight exceptions, for seventy miles, the boundary between it and the territory of Jaloun, of Bownee, and of Behree; then, entering Humeerpore, in lat. $25^\\circ 54'$, long. $80^\\circ 3'$, it flows through it for twenty miles, to its junction with the Jumna. The Deesaun, coming from the Vindhya Mountains, lying to the southward, touches\nHUMEERPOOR.\n\non the district in lat. $25^\\circ 20'$, long. $79^\\circ 20'$, and continuing to flow northerly for forty-six miles, until its junction with the Betwa, forms generally the boundary between Humeerpore and the territory of Jhansee. The large river Cane touches on the district in lat. $25^\\circ 35'$, long. $80^\\circ 20'$, and, running either northeast or north, forms the boundary between it and the British district of Banda for thirteen miles, to the junction with the Jumna. There are several smaller streams tributary to those already mentioned. The average elevation above the sea, of the waterway of the Jumna, at the northern extremity of the district, is probably about 550 feet, and perhaps no point within it is 300 feet above that height.\n\nThe soil is generally a black friable mould, composed probably of disintegrated volcanic formations, which are of frequent occurrence in the neighbouring mountains, mingled with the alluvial deposits of the numerous streams, and with the remains of decayed vegetation. In some parts, however, kankar or calcareous tufa is the prevailing ingredient, which, repelling the efforts of cultivation, yields little but a scanty growth of herbage and stunted shrubs. The population is very ill supplied with fuel, using generally dried cow-dung for that purpose. The black soil \"is as productive as any in Hindostan.\" It is favourable to the growth of sugarcane, cotton, indigo, the aal-plant (Morinda multiflora), wheat, barley, Holcus sorghum, Holcus spicatus, and every species of the pulse and lentil tribe. In the more sterile parts are grown several species of grain of the millet kind. The cotton, which is produced on the better soil in great abundance and of good quality, is largely transmitted from Calpee, and other places on the Jumna, to the lower provinces. Under the last revenue settlement of the North-Western Provinces, the government demand upon the land of this district was fixed for a term of years, and is not liable to increase till the year 1872.\n\nBuffaloes and kine are the chief domesticated quadrupeds. The sheep are small, but the goats are of superior breed. In the time of Baber, in the early part of the sixteenth century,\n\n* The estimate made by Jacquemont of the elevation of the country about Ajegarah, might seem to indicate that in the text to be too great; but there is much reason to conclude that Jacquemont's estimate falls short of the truth.\nwild elephants abounded in this tract, but are now unknown, though their fossilized bones have been discovered near Calpee.\n\nThe climate is not favourable to the European constitution, having a tendency to occasion intermitting fevers; but the natives appear to enjoy a full average share of health. During the latter part of spring and commencement of summer the heat is very great.\n\nThe few and unimportant manufactures are coarse cottons, paper, and refined sugar.\n\nThe population consists generally of Boondelas, a spurious tribe of Rajpoots, infamous, it is said, for treachery and other villany, and possessing no good quality but courage. There are several other tribes of less importance. The number of inhabitants, as ascertained by actual enumeration in 1848, is stated to be, Hindoo agricultural, 299,558; Hindoo non-agricultural, 120,125; Mahomedans and others, agricultural, 10,223; same classes, non-agricultural, 22,185; total, 452,091. The number of towns or villages containing less than 1,000 inhabitants, is returned at 713; those containing more than 1,000 and less than 5,000, at 105; those containing more than 5,000 and less than 10,000, at three; and those containing more than 10,000 also at three.\n\nThe principal military routes are\u20141. From north to south, from Cawnpore to Banda, by Humeerpore; 2. from north to south, a little east of the last-named, from Cawnpore to Banda, by Chilah Tarah ferry; 3. from south-east to north-west, from Banda to Calpee; 4. from north to south, from Calpee to Kitha, and thence to Chutterpore and Saugor; 5. from south-east to north-west, from Banda to Gwalior.\n\nThe tract of which this district forms part, seems to have been always of some importance in India, and Ferishta relates that Vasdev, king of Kunouj, about the year 350, founded the fort of Calpee. It was amongst the earliest of the Mussulman conquests in India, having been taken in 1196 by Kutbudin, viceroy of Muhammed of Ghor. It submitted to the Timurian\n\n* In accordance with the proverb\u2014\"One native of Bundelkhund commits as much fraud as one hundred weighmen.\"\n\n\u2020 These are\u2014Calpee, 18,714 inhabitants; Khureela, 12,005 ditto; Koonch, 12,885 ditto.\ninvader Baber, in 1527, and was frequently the scene of his military operations. A British force invaded it in 1778, crossing over the Jumna from the Doab, and taking the fort of Calpee. In the same year, General Goddard led his army from that place on the celebrated march which he performed across India to Surat. Towards the close of the last century, it was overrun by the Mahrattas, and subsequently transferred by Hummat Bahadur, one of their chiefs, to the East-India Company, to whom it was guaranteed by the Peishwa, in 1802, by Art. IV. of the treaty of Bassein; and in the following year the British troops took Calpee and occupied the country.\n\nHUMEERPORE, the principal place of the British district, and also of the pergunnah of the same name, a town situate on the tongue of land or doab at the confluence of the Betwa and Jumna, on the right bank of the latter. The Jumna, according to Jacquemont, in February, has a stream of 1,000 feet wide, running in a channel half a mile in breadth, with a rapidity of three or four miles an hour. The town is considerable, consisting originally of several villages grouped together. It is a civil station; the European establishment consists of one magistrate and collector, one joint magistrate and deputy collector, and one assistant to the magistrate and collector. It is on the route from Banda to Cawnpore, 36 miles N. of the former, 39 S. of the latter, 28 S.E. of Calpee, 155 S.E. of Agra, 110 N.W. of Allahabad, 575 N.W. of Calcutta.

Lat. 15\u00b0 9', long. 76\u00b0 8'.\n\nHUNDIA, HINDIA, or HUNDERAH, in the British district of Allahabad, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a small town on the route from the city of Allahabad to that of Benares, and 23 miles S.E. of the former. The road in this part of the route is excellent in the dry season, but heavy and cut up during rains, when the country, which lies rather low, is swampy, though in many places partially cultivated.

Lat. 33\u00b0 31', long. 71\u00b0 25'.\n\nHUNGRUNG, in Bussahir, a subdivision of the district of Koonawur, is a very elevated region, bounded on the south and west by the lofty limestone range of Hungrung, on the north by Ladakh, and on the east by Chinese Tartary. It lies between lat. 31\u00b0 48'\u201432\u00b0 8', long. 78\u00b0 25'\u201478\u00b0 45'. It is nearly co-extensive with the valley of the river Spiti, in the lower part of its course, which enters this district on the western frontier, near Shealkur, at an elevation of 10,400 feet above the sea, and leaves it at the point of confluence with the Sutluj, at an elevation of 8,494 feet. It results from the cold attendant on this great elevation, and the aridity of the air at such a distance from the ocean, combined with the natural sterility of the mountains, that the country presents an almost inconceivable scene of desolation. At the same time, there is no stupendous scenery to interest the traveller, as the mountains are of very tame outline, being generally formed of gravel, from the disintegration of rocks of granite, clay-slate, or loose limestone; while undulating heights, or elevated plains, stretch as far as the eye can reach, presenting, though a varying, yet always a dreary expanse, through which a traveller may hold his way for days without meeting with a human habitation. The exceptions, which occur at long\n\n---\n\n1 Gerard, Koonawur, Table iii. No. 106, at end of vol.\n2 Gerard, Map of Kunawur; also Table, ut supra, No. 88.\nHUNGRUNG.\n\nintervals, are afforded by small villages or hamlets of a few huts, situate amidst scanty fields of wheat, buckwheat, or pulse, fenced with gooseberry-bushes, or surrounded with stunted poplars, planted for the sake of their leaves, which are used as fodder. Sometimes an encampment of Tartars, with their flocks and black tents, may be seen amidst a dismal waste, unbroken by a single tree, or any vegetation rising above a few inches in height. Here and there the surface is scantily clad with prickly shrubs resembling furze, giving the country the appearance of a wild of Northern Europe. In summer, the yellow blossoms of these plants give a transient gleam of cheerfulness to the scene; but towards the close of the year, furious blasts, utterly destitute of moisture, and dreadfully chilling, sweep over the face of the country, and suspend all vegetation; reducing the leaves and more succulent stalks of the plants and diminutive shrubs to powder, and turning their stems black, as if scorched by fire. Exposure to those winds destroys animal life, except in the yak, goat, sheep, dog, and other creatures protected by a dense under-coat of fine down; or in the human inhabitant of these deserts, who loads himself with such a quantity of woollen garments, that a stranger is led to deem him scarcely able to move. Notwithstanding the scanty and stunted character of the vegetation, there is a considerable number, as well as variety, of quadrupeds, yaks, mountain ponies, mules, goats, and asses, besides sheep of large size, which are much used for burthen, as they carry twenty pounds weight over rough roads, and generally reach their evening ground before loaded porters. Their services in this way are found very valuable for the carriage of grain in forced expeditions; and, after the consumption of their burdens, the animals themselves are killed, and used as food. Vegetation proceeds at heights inexplicable on preconceived notions: a species of buckwheat ripens at an elevation of 16,000 feet; a shrub like furze produces blossoms and seeds, and attains a size sufficient for firewood, at 17,000 feet; and Gerard gathered vegetable specimens close upon the limit of 18,000. \"Fifteen thousand feet,\" Gerard observes, \"in lat. 32\u00b0, according to the generally received theory, should be veiled in impenetrable snow; but here it is very different; and numerous droves of cattle feed upon the thinly-scattered herbage at least 2,000\nfeet higher, where the sunrise temperature must always be several degrees below the freezing point.\"\n\nHungung is inhabited by Tartars, or that variety of mankind styled by physiologists Mongolian. They are of good stature, athletic, and of ruddy complexions; have small oblong eyes and high cheekbones; their eyebrows are thin, and very few have either moustaches or beards, which, however, they hold in great honour. Gerard states them to be invariably hospitable, friendly, peaceable, and even amiable in their dispositions. \"Cheating, lying, and thieving are unknown; and they may be trusted with anything. They have the nicest notions of honesty of any people on the face of the earth, and pay an inviolable regard to property.\" They dress in a warm woollen cloth, called sooklat, which resembles blanketing, and almost all, both men and women, go bareheaded, even in the coldest weather. The women load themselves with a number of uncouth trinkets. \"I saw,\" says Gerard, \"upwards of 100 at Shipke, and nearly as many at Speetee, who came in crowds to see me; the whole of them were literally almost weighed and groaning under a load of ornaments; such as immense anklets and bracelets of silver or pewter, heavy earrings, metal chains of various kinds, beads of silver, precious stones, coloured glass, and cowrie-shells strung round the neck, ankles, and arms, and attached to different parts of their dress.\" The men too have their share of those incumbrances. Their food consists almost exclusively of flesh, as the little grain produced in the country is generally fermented, to yield a spirit called chong, to the use of which they are much addicted. Yaks and other animals are killed for winter store, in September; and such is the dryness of the air, that their carcasses are cured by hanging them up, though the temperature at midday generally exceeds that of England at the same season. Tea boiled with butter is very generally drunk, and tobacco universally used where within reach. Polyandry is common, and female chastity unknown. Lamaism, the religion of this race, is as singular as the physical circumstances under which they are placed. The lamas in Koonawur, according to Gerard, are of three sects,\u2014Geloopa, Dookpa, and Neengma; a fourth, called Shammar, mentioned by another writer, Gerard could not trace. The grand lama of Lahassa, called Geabong Rimboche, who\nHUNGRUNG.\n\nresides in Potala, is the chief pontiff of all the lamas. The next in dignity is the Punchin Rimboche, who resides at Teeshoo Loomboo; and the third, the Lochawa Rimboche, resident in the same place. These three personages are never supposed to die; but on the dissolution of the body, the spirit is thought to take possession of another tenement. The succession to the last-named inheritor of divine authority, Lochawa Rimboche, seems on the latest occasion of his transmigration to have been embarrassed by the appearance of two children, both possessing the marks by which the true claimant was to be recognised. After a degree of consideration, and an extent of correspondence proportioned to the grave importance of the question at issue, it was decided that the pretensions of both were genuine, and that there were two lochawas; but, lest the two divine personages might not be actuated by unity of will, it was very judiciously provided, that one had precedence of the other. There are monks called Gelongs, and nuns, Anis, who live in secluded buildings, where they employ themselves in chanting hymns, and writing and printing sacred sentences from blocks of wood, having nothing to do with worldly concerns, or at least, having the reputation of renouncing them. Music enters largely into their ritual observances, in which they use cymbals, tambourines, immense brass trumpets, large drums fixed on wooden frames, and an instrument of singular construction, being a human thigh-bone, pierced with holes, \"which sounds like the sea-conch, or sacred shell of the Hindoos.\" \"You scarcely ever see a Gelong,\" observes Gerard, \"but he is singing. If you ask a question, he answers it, but immediately resumes his song, which is generally the favourite invocation, 'Oom* mane paemee oom,' as Captain Turner spells it; but the last word is here pronounced 'hoong.'\"\n\n* Ut supra, 190.\n\n* Koonawur, 129.\n\n* Gerard' observes, that he was as unsuccessful as Turner in his attempts to ascertain the meaning of this mysterious exclamation. Jacquemont, however, on the authority of Csoma de Koros, the well-known student of the Tibetan language, states it to be \"the Pater, the Credo, the Confiteor of the lamas, who, many thousand times a day, repeat this short sentence, counting by means of their rosaries how often they have done so. They certainly do not understand it. At Kanum, where it is the exclusive text of the prayers of the lamas, M. Csoma explained it to me. It is Tibetan; Oum is an interjection; Mani means 'woman,' 'gem;' Paemee, the nenuphar or 'water-lily;' the concluding Oum is an\nHUNGRUNG.\n\nHungrungr, according to Herbert, pays only 900 rupees (90l.) a year to the rajah of Bussahir; and its chief value seems to consist in its serving as a channel of communication both with Ladak and Chinese Tartary; the route to the former lying up the valley of the Li, or river of Spiti; that of the latter, up the valley of the Sutluj. The population of Hungrungr proper probably does not exceed 2,000.\n\nHUNGRUNG, in Bussahir, a pass in the district of Koonawur, over a range of limestone mountains, bounding the district of Hungrungr on the south-west. The route from the south-west proceeds up a dell to the crest, which commands an extensive view in both directions; the southern, or Koonawur side, and the northern, or Tartarian. Hutton, who crossed the pass in June, found furze and junipers growing on the south-western side as far as the summit; but on the northern side, the snow reached continuously several hundred yards from the crest. Several travellers have mentioned the strongly-marked change which takes place in the aspect of the country in proceeding northward across this range. \"The change in the nature of the country is most sudden: looking from the summit of the range in a northerly direction over Hungrungr, the country is seen to wear a sad and sombre air of cheerless desolation; not a tree is to be seen, and the black and crumbling hills are either wholly barren, or clothed with nothing of larger growth than the dwarf willow and the dog-rose. The hills are chiefly of the secondary class, and being more rounded in their outline, want the grand and almost terrific beauty of the interjection, as the first. However we may twist these words, it is evidently impossible to find any meaning in them. M. Osoma could not show me that the best-informed lamas attributed any to them. I suppose this mystic exclamation to have been translated from Sanscrit, because I do not think that the nenuphar is found in Lake Mansarower, nor in any Tibetan lake, though those plants are common in all the pieces of water in India, and celebrated there for their beautiful blossoms.\" Vigne gives a similar account of the exclamation, in his Travels in Northern Punjab. The veneration of the lotus (Padma) is connected with the worship of Vi\u00e1hnu, from whose navel it issued, as he slept on the bottom of the ocean. See Wilford and H\u00fcgel.\n\n* Jacquemont, always fond of expressing his dissent from the English who have preceded him in exploring, denies that there is any such decided difference in the physical character of the two regions; but Gerard, Herbert, and Hutton, are unanimous on the point.\n\n1 Journ.

It is called sometimes Gangadwara,\u2020 or the \"Gate of the Ganges,\" being situate on its western or right bank, at the southern base of the Sewalik range, here intersected by a ravine or gorge, by which the river, finally leaving the mountainous region, commences its course over the plain of Hindostan. The stream here is divided by islands into three channels,\u00b3 the principal one being on the eastern side. They are all so shallow in places, that the passage of large unloaded boats through them is not practicable without difficulty. The breadth of the river in the rainy season, from the extreme eastern to the extreme western bank, is represented to be \"a full mile.\"\u2074 The town, which has an appearance of great antiquity, is situate close to the western bank, and the foundations of many of the houses are in the bed of the river. Raper,\u2075 who visited it in 1808, describes it, at that time, as very inconsiderable, having only one street, about fifteen feet in breadth and a furlong and a half in length. Most of the houses have the upper part of brick, the lower of stone, which is of good quality. Chiefly, perhaps, from this town being situate close to the point at which the Ganges\n\n* Hari's Gate; from Hari, \"a name of Vishnu,\" and Dwar, \"a gate.\"\n\nThe learned Ritter\u00b9 seems mistaken in the etymology of this name. According to him, Haridwara is the Dwara, that is, the gate, of Hari or Mahadeva: \"Haridwara (d. i. dwara, Thor des Hari oder Mahadewa).\"\n\nBut Hari is a name of Vishnu,\u00b2 and not of Mahadeva, who, in Hindu mythology, is the same as Siva. He was probably led into this error by Raper,\u00b3 who states, \"This place derives its names from Hara, which is synonymous with Mahadeva, and Dwara, a door or passage.\" But Colebrooke\u2074 (H.T.) corrects this in the following note on the above passage:\u2014\n\n\"It is written Haridwara in the Cedarachanda of the Scanda Purana, and other Puranas. This marks a different etymology; or from Hari, Vishnu, not from Hara, Mahadeva.\"\n\n\u2020 Wilford states that it is also called Gangawarta, or \"the Awarta of the Ganges;\" which he thus explains:\u2014\"The Awarta signifies an inclosed place of a circular form, and is more particularly applied to places of worship.\"\n\n\u00b9 Statistics N.W.

Ablution in the river is the great rite practised here by the Hindoo pilgrims, their belief being, that purgation from sin is thus obtained. According to their notions, the orthodox place for bathing is at the ghat or stairs leading down to the river, and called Harika Pairi, or \"the stairs\" of Vishnu.\" Priority in ablution at the propitious moment is considered to be of great importance in a spiritual point of view, and many persons have formerly perished in the attempt to secure the advantage, being either crushed to death in the rushing crowd, or precipitated into the river, and there drowned. In 1819, \"in consequence of a desperate rush made by the infatuated pilgrims to gain a precedence in bathing, 430 persons were squeezed to death; among whom were several British sepoys, placed as guards to prevent this very catastrophe.\" The propitious moment is laid down by astrologers, according to their alleged calculations and observations, and sometimes happens at midnight. Since the occurrence of the accident above mentioned, the East-India Company's government has caused the old ghat to be replaced by one of sixty steps, and 100 feet wide. The rigidly pious, and those who dread to enter the water unassisted, are supported by a Brahmin on each side. As, however, the depth close to the ghat is not above four feet, the majority plunge in unassisted, men and women bathing together indiscriminately.\n\nThe assemblage of pilgrims, which is annual, is attended by people from all parts of India, and from many places far beyond its bounds. \"The bathing\" commences in the month of Chaitra, when the sun is in Mina or Pisces, and concludes on the day he enters Mesha or Aries, agreeably to the solar computation of the Hindoos, and corresponding with the 10th April, on which day the sun has actually advanced $20\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 in that sign. Every twelfth year is celebrated with greater rejoicing, and is called the Cumba Mela, so denoted from the planet Jupiter\n\n* Raper calls this ghat Hara-ca-Pairi, which name he translates \"foot of Hara,\" but no doubt erroneously, the proper denomination being Harika-Pairi, or \"the Stairs of Hari;\" the word signifying \"stairs.\"\n\n\u2020 From Kumbh, \"the sign Aquarius,\" and Mela, \"a fair.\"\n\n6 Hamilton, East-India Gazetteer, l. 667.\n7 Skinner, Excursions in India, l. 188.\n8 Mundy, Sketches in India, l. 156.\n9 Raper, ut supra, 450.\n1 Shakespeare, Dict. 409.\nbeing then in the sign of Aquarius. Whether this sign be symbolical of the purpose for which they meet, or whether the conjunction be arbitrary or accidental, is not ascertained; but a pilgrimage at those duodecennial periods is considered the most fortunate and efficacious.\" The 10th of April is the Purbi or last day of bathing. The Mela or fair, held on this occasion for commercial purposes, is the means of very extensive traffic. From the Punjab, and from the countries west of the Indus, are brought camels, horses, mules, salt, antimony, fine woollens and piece-goods, tobacco, assaf\u0153tida, dried fruits (such as apricots, figs, prunes, raisins), almonds, pistachio-nuts, and pomegranates; from Cashmere, shawls and other fine woollen fabrics; from Rajpootana, various fancy-goods, such as chins or spotted turbans, toys, and other wares in metals and ivory, besides inferior woollens, and a great number of camels; from the British provinces, cotton and silk fabrics, and European goods. There are besides less-important articles of commerce in great quantity and variety; and the food required for the vast assembled multitude constitutes an extensive and lucrative subject of traffic. The number of those who on these occasions resort to Hurdwar from various motives is enormous. Hardwicke, who visited the Cumbh-mela in 1796, and paid much attention to the subject, estimated the number at two millions and a half; and Raper, at the following Cumbh-mela, in 1808, says, \"If we estimate the number at two millions of souls, we shall probably fall short rather than exceed the reality.\" No such number* is, however, at any one time assembled; as those who visit the place for the purpose of bathing, arrive in the morning and depart in the evening, or on the next day; so that there is a constant succession of strangers. Such a collection of people, under the influences which bring them together, and rule them, may readily be imagined ripe for any acts which their spiritual leaders may suggest; and the rivalry of conflicting parties has often led to sanguinary conflicts. In 1760, on the Purbi, two rival sects,\u2014the Gossains and the Bairagis, met in battle, which terminated in the defeat of the latter, of whom,\n\n* Bacon, writing at a much later date says, \"The number of pilgrims is generally in excess of 300,000, though this year it did not amount to 200,000.\" The period of his visit, however, was not that of the duodecennial festival.\naccording to report, 18,000 were slain. At the time of Hardwicke's visit, in 1796, the Gosains, venturing to resist the better-organized Sikh pilgrims, were defeated with the loss of about 500 men. The latest of the great duodecennial gatherings took place in 1844, and passed off without disturbance.\n\nHurdwar formerly bore the name of Koupela or Goupela. According to Wilford, it was so named from an ancient ascetic. \"Capila, a most religious man, performed for a long time religious austerities near Hurdwar, where they show to this day the place where he lived, under the name of Capila-Sthan; hence the pass of Hurdwar is sometimes called the pass of Capila or Kupeleh.\" Tamerlane, marching to this place after taking Delhi, massacred a multitude of Hindoos here assembled, and carried off a rich booty. The elevation of Hurdwar above the sea is 1,024 feet; and a little below the town is the head of the great canal of irrigation for the North-Western Provinces, for an account of which see Ganges River.

He states that the declivity on which the water ran, was, in a distance of sixty miles, which he measured, \"less than four inches per mile;\" and adds, \"I have no reason to suppose that its general descent exceeds it.\" The elevation of Hurdwar being 1,024 feet, if the distance from that place be assumed with Rennell at 1,350 miles, the descent will turn out to be above nine inches.

It lies between lat. $28^\\circ 33'$\u2014$29^\\circ 49'$, long. $75^\\circ 20'$\u2014$76^\\circ 22'$, and comprehends an area of 3,300 square miles. Its soil appears to be for the most part formed of alluvial matter swept down by the Gagur, the Chitang, and other streams flowing from the Sub-Himalaya, and is, as might be expected, very fertile, producing, where duly watered, large crops of rice, wheat, barley, millet, pulse, and various other productions. The grass, of superior quality and uncommonly luxuriant, affords pasturage not surpassed in any part of India. Its luxuriance, however, depends on the periodical rains falling at the close of summer and early part of autumn, when the inhabitants partially provide for their future wants by preserving the water in numerous tanks lined with masonry. These supplies fail, however, as the hot season advances, and then recourse must be had to wells, of which some are 100 feet in depth, some 120, and some even more. The necessity for this is imposed by the fact of the land-springs lying very far beneath the surface, and the mountain-torrents being lost by absorption or evaporation farther north, in Sirhind. The country is consequently for great part of the year excessively arid; the few springs to be met with are for the most part brackish; and the want of water is a source of distress. This tract was a favourite hunting-ground of Feroz Toghluk, the renowned king of Delhi, the ruins of whose buildings still occupy several square miles, and who, in the year 1356, to obtain a supply of water, as well for his numerous followers as for the purposes of irrigation, made a canal from the Jumna, which, passing by Hansi and Hissar, proceeded westward until it joined the river Gagur. This canal, which had been nearly obliterated, was cleared out in 1825; and by this process, the extension of the main line, and the construction of additional branches, was made largely available for the purposes of irrigation, as well as for rafting timber and navigating small barges.\n\nThe jungles and wastes of Hurreeanah still harbour many wild beasts.

According to the legend, it received its name from Hasti, its founder; but it is perhaps more probable, as the name means \"elephant's town,\" and those animals still abound in the forest about fifty miles north, at the south-western base of the Sewalik range, that this circumstance affords the true derivation. It is also called Hastinagara, a word of similar import to its more usual name.\n\nIn the Ayeen Akbery, it is mentioned under the name of Hustnapoor, and stated to be \"an ancient Hindoo place of worship, on the banks of the Ganges,\" and to yield a revenue of 1,11,672 rupees.

The account given of it by Hamilton, Ritter, and some others, is little more than a repetition of Wilford, who states that there \"remains only a small place of worship, and the extensive site of that ancient city is entirely covered with large ant-hills, which have induced the inhabitants of the adjacent country to suppose that it had been overturned or destroyed by the Termites.\" Lat. 29\u00b0 10', long. 78\u00b0 3'.\n\nHUSTNAPOOR.\u2014A town in the British district of Cuddapah, presidency of Madras, 126 miles N.W. by W. of Madras.

The form of the territory is that of a trapezium, the base of which is about 420 miles in a direction from north-east to south-west, from Humpasagra, in lat. 18\u00b0 10', long. 76\u00b0, to Mulcaulgherry, in lat. 17\u00b0 49', long. 81\u00b0 30'; its north-eastern side extends from south-east to north-west, a distance of 390 miles, from Mulcaulgherry, above mentioned, to Meil Ghaut, in lat. 21\u00b0 40', long. 77\u00b0 15'; its north-western, in a direction from north-east to south-west, a distance of 220 miles, from Meil Ghaut, as above, to Phooltaumba, lat. 19\u00b0 47', long. 74\u00b0 40'; and the south-western, a distance of 330 miles, from Phooltaumba to Humpasagra. Though such is the general outline of the country, the boundaries are marked by numerous sinuosities, causing them to deviate greatly from right lines. The territory lies between lat. 15\u00b0 10'\u201421\u00b0 42', long. 74\u00b0 40'\u201481\u00b0 32'; is 475 miles in length from south-west to north-east, and about the same distance in breadth. The area is estimated at 95,337 square miles. It is bounded on the north-east by the territory of the rajah of Nagpore; on the south-east by territory subject to the presidency of Madras, and the territory lately belonging to the nawaub of Kurnool; on the west by territory subject to the presidency of Bombay; on the north-west by territory belonging to the presidency last named, by the territory of Gwalior, or of the family of Scindia, and by the British districts of Saugor and Nerbudda. Within the western part of the territory, are isolated some small British possessions. The Hyderabad territory is a tract of considerable elevation, on an average varying probably from 700 to 800 feet above the level of the sea, and some granitic summits attain an elevation of 2,500 feet. The elevation of the city of Hyderabad is laid down on barometrical measurement as 1,672 feet above the same level. With the exception of the valley of the Taptee, at the northern extremity of the territory, and which is bounded on the north by the Vindhya range, and on the south by the high land of the Godavery, the\n\n---\n\n1 E.I.C.

Beng. 1833, p. 303.\n6 Ibid.\nwhole drainage of the country is either from west to east, or from north-west to south-east, discharging itself into the Bay of Bengal by the channels of the Godavery and the Kistna. The drainage of the valley of the Taptee, flowing westward, is discharged into the Gulf of Cambay. The geological formations are on a large scale; in the north-west being of the great volcanic formation, extending through the greater part of the Deccan, and principally trap, but in some parts basalt. In the middle, the southern, and the south-western parts, the formations are primary, being granite, gneiss, syenite, and quartz. In the north-east part of the territory, along the right bank of the Godavery, there is much sandstone, some of it carboniferous. Though this territory is for the most part an undulating plain, there are many isolated hills and ranges of moderate elevation. That in the vicinity of the city of Hyderabad may especially be noted. The Hyderabad territory is within the influence of the south-west monsoon, and the average annual fall of rain is stated to be about thirty-two inches. From this circumstance, and the moderate declivity of the surface, it is a well-watered tract, rivers being numerous, and tanks or artificial pieces of water very abundant. Of rivers, the Godavery, rising on the eastern declivity of the Western Ghats, near Nassick, in the British district of Ahmednuggur, takes a course south-east for about ninety miles, to Phooltamba, where it touches on this territory, and, continuing to flow along the border south-eastward for seventy miles, to Mungi, in lat. 19\u00b0 27', long. 75\u00b0 30', there enters the Hyderabad territory, through which it holds a course nearly easterly for about 160 miles, to the vicinity of Lasona, in lat. 19\u00b0 7', long. 77\u00b0 5'. At that place, it, on the left side, receives the Doodna, a considerable stream flowing from the north-west; and eighty-five miles lower down, or farther eastward, it, in lat. 18\u00b0 48', long. 77\u00b0 55', receives on the right side the Manjera, a large river coming from the south. It thence continues to hold a course generally easterly for about 190 miles, to Kulaisur, in lat. 18\u00b0 52', long. 79\u00b0 53', where, on the left side, it receives the Pranheeta, a large river from the north; and from the confluence turning south-east, flows for about 155 miles in that direction, along the south-western base of the mountains of Bustar, to Kottoor, in lat. 17\u00b0 29', long.\nHYDERABAD.\n\n81\u00b0 29', where it passes into Orissa. Below Kulaisur, it flows parallel to the north-eastern boundary of the Hyderabad territory, towards that of Nagpore, and on an average about eight or ten miles distant from it. Thus, the total length of this great river, by the border and through the territory, is about 660 miles, for above 200 of which it is navigable from June to February. The Wurda, rising in the Deogarh Mountains, in the territory of Nagpore, flows south-west for a few miles, and touching on this territory at Gudra, lat. 21\u00b0 35', long. 78\u00b0 26', thence flows towards the south-east 170 miles, till near Chanda, and in lat. 19\u00b0 55', long. 79\u00b0 15', it on the right side receives the Payne Gungra, a large river from the west; continuing to flow in a south-easterly direction for sixty miles, it, at Chumprai, in lat. 19\u00b0 37', long. 79\u00b0 52', on the left side, receives the Waingunga, flowing from the north. Below the confluence, the united stream, now called the Pranheeta, flows in a tortuous direction, but generally south, for about eighty miles, to Kulsisur, in lat. 18\u00b0 52', long. 79\u00b0 53'. The stream, through nearly its whole length of course, whether denominated the Wurda or the Pranheeta, is the boundary between this territory and that of Nagpore. It is navigable for about 170 miles. The Kistna, rising near Mahabulishwur, in the Western Ghats, holds a course south-east for about 320 miles, to lat. 16\u00b0 10', long. 76\u00b0 18', where it touches, and ten miles further passes into, this territory, through which it flows in a direction generally north-east for about seventy-five miles, to Kadloor, in lat. 16\u00b0 24', long. 77\u00b0 20', where it on the left side receives the Beema from the north-west; after which accession, turning south-east, it flows eighty miles in that direction, to its confluence with the Toongabudra, in lat. 15\u00b0 58', long. 78\u00b0 19', where it turns north-east, and flows 180 miles, to lat. 16\u00b0 50', long. 80\u00b0 10', at which point it passes into the territory known as the Northern Circars. From the confluence to the point last named, it forms the south-eastern boundary of the Hyderabad territory towards Kurnoul and the British district of Guntoor. Thus, its total length of course connected with this territory is 345 miles, during which, however, in consequence of the ruggedness and declivity of its bed, it is of little use as a channel of navigation. The Toongabudra, formed by the junction of the rivers Toonga and Budra in Mysore, flows\nHYDERABAD.\n\nnorth-eastward, and at Moodlapoor, in lat. 15\u00b0 8', long. 76\u00b0 1', first touches this territory, along the south-eastern boundary of which it flows, separating it from the British district of Bellary and the territory of Kurnoul for a distance of 200 miles, to its confluence with the Kistna. Many other streams (considerable rivers during the annual periodical rains, but much reduced in volume at other times of the year) are discharged into these main channels of drainage. Tanks are, as before observed, numerous, and some of them are of very great size, as that at Pakhal, which is at least thirty miles in circuit. They are generally formed by throwing an embankment across the lower end of a valley, and thus causing the stoppage and accumulation of the water of such streams as may flow into it.\n\nThe climate may be considered in general good, and as there are no arid, bare deserts, similar to those of Rajpootana and some other tracts of Northern India, the hot winds are less felt. In the vicinity of the city of Hyderabad, the mean temperature in the house, according to observations made at sunrise, at two o'clock in the afternoon, and at sunset, for one year, \"was in January, 74\u00bd\u00b0; February, 76\u00bd\u00b0; March, 84\u00b0; April, 91\u00bd\u00b0; May, 93\u00b0; June, 88\u00b0; July, 81\u00b0; August, 80\u00bd\u00b0; September, 79\u00b0; October, 80\u00b0; November, 76\u00bd\u00b0; December, 74\u00bd\u00b0: giving as an annual mean 81\u00bd\u00b0.\" The south-west monsoon commences about the beginning of June, and ends about the beginning of October, and, as is usually the case, brings heavy rains. After it has ceased, variable weather continues for a few weeks; and this is followed by the north-east monsoon, bringing rains, though less heavy than those accompanying the former. At midwinter the variation of temperature in the northern part of the territory is very great and sudden. The mornings are very cold, and ice is formed; but the days are hot, the thermometer sometimes reaching 80\u00b0 in the shade. The closing monsoons are considered the most unhealthy periods of the year, producing fevers and agues, but in general not of formidable types, except in the vicinity of extensive marshy jungles. Diseases of the spleen are common in the vicinity of the Godavery. Cholera is not a prevalent disease, and when it does occur, is consequent on famine. Diseases of the eyes are prevalent in the sandstone districts. The wells\nHYDERABAD.\n\nin general yield impure, unpalatable water, productive of disease, especially the dracunculus or guinea-worm, from which those who use the water from tanks or streams are exempt.\n\nScarcely any attempt appears to have been made to investigate the zoology of this extensive country. From its numerous jungles, it must abound in game, and in the beasts that prey on it. Tigers are very numerous, and the large leopard, as well as the cheta or hunting-leopard, lurks in every covert. The nylgau, and other antelopes, are numerous, and wild buffaloes harbour in the extensive forests towards the north-east frontier. Horned cattle, for burthen and draught, are of fine qualities, being of good size, strong, and hardy. There is considerable care given to selecting good breeds, and the young animals are allowed to continue with their dams in a state approaching to wildness until they are nearly full-grown.\n\nThe soil is in general fertile, though in some parts it consists of chilka, a red and gritty mould, little fitted, from the coarseness of its particles, for purposes of agriculture. Resembling the last, but composed of particles more minute, is lalzumeen, a soil also of reddish hue, and considered by Walker\\(^9\\) to be formed of the remains of broken-down ant-hills, which are surprisingly numerous in this country. Thus, observes the writer just referred to, \"we see that those insects, usually looked upon as troublesome and destructive pests, are not without their use in a grand natural operation. The peculiar acid (the formic), which is their chief agent, acts on the alkali and lime, and most probably on the silica of the rock debris, pulverizing it, and facilitating, in all probability, fresh combinations. The soil, when manured, is fitted for the reception of all kinds of crops, without reference to season.\" Though less extensive than those just enumerated, the regur or black cotton soil occurs in many places, and is esteemed the best of any, and, as indicated by the epithet above applied to it, peculiarly suited for the cultivation of cotton. It requires no manure, except that left by sheep generally fed on it fallowed, previously to its cultivation. This is, however, an important resource, as flocks of sheep are everywhere to be seen. There is also a soil denominated talao-ka-jumeen, a black earth, dug from the bottoms of tanks, but not much prized, being a stiff clay, and containing a profusion of small fresh-water shells. Its extreme tenacity is\n\n\\(^9\\) Journ. As. Soc. Beng. 1841, p. 387 \u2014Walker, on Productions and Manufactures in the Nizam's Territory.\nfound unfavourable to vegetation, which is farther thwarted by a large impregnation of carbonate of soda. This, however, is collected from it in great quantities, for manufacturing and commercial purposes. All those soils effervescce with acids, thereby indicating that they contain carbonate of lime. Throughout this territory, the ground, wherever left uncultivated even but for a year or two, becomes covered with a low jungle, composed chiefly of the Cassia auriculata and Zizyphus microphylla.\n\nIn process of time, the appearance of the jungle is enlivened by the growth of numerous trees, of which the principal\\(^1\\) are\u2014Butea frondosa, Bombax heptaphyllum, Erythrina indica, Hyperanthera moringa, Cassia fistula, Annona reticulata, Melia azadirachta, Bauhinia parviflora, Capparis trifoliata, Ficus indica, Ficus religiosa, Bombax gossipinum, Feronia elephantum, and several species of acacia. The toddy-palm, Borassus flabelliformis, and Phoenix sylvestris, are extensively cultivated on account of their sap, which is drawn off copiously, and fermented into an intoxicating beverage. The cocoanut-tree cannot be brought to high perfection, even with the greatest care, accompanied by the most favourable circumstances; and in consequence, its cultivation is very circumscribed. Mango and tamarind-trees occur in great numbers about the villages. The betel-vine is also cultivated, but in no great quantities. The principal grain crops are\u2014rice, of which there are no less than eight varieties, wheat, maize of various kinds, jowar (Holcus sorghum), bajra (Holcus spicatus), raggy (Cynosurus corocanus); of oil-plants, mustard, Sesamum orientale, and Ricinus communis or castor-oil plant. Of leguminous growths there are\u2014Dolichos lablab, Dolichos gladiatus, Phaseolus mungo, chenna (Cicer arietinum). Melons, cucumbers, gourds, and some other cucurbitaceae, are largely grown, and form important articles of diet. The gardens produce onions, garlic, carrots, radishes, potatoes, sweet potatoes, coriander, ginger, turmeric, various kinds of amaranth, used as pothersbs. Tobacco is cultivated, but not to a great extent. Cotton, indigo, and sugarcane, are the more important objects of the agriculturist's care. Al (Morinda citrifolia) and chay-root (Oldenlandia umbellata), valuable dyes, occur wild, and are also cultivated.\n\nThere appear to be scarcely any manufactures for the supply\nHYDERABAD.\n\nof external commerce. For home supply, the wool of the native sheep is extensively manufactured into blankets and other coarse woollen fabrics. Cotton is also manufactured into coarse fabrics. The most important department of manufacturing industry is, however, silk; the material being tusser,\\(^2\\) or that gathered in the woods, the produce of a wild species of worm. Hides, raw and tanned, and both of domesticated and wild quadrupeds, are articles of some importance in commerce. Wild bees swarm in all the jungles; consequently wax and honey are very abundant and cheap. Lac, suitable for use as a resin or a dye, may be obtained in quantities far beyond the present extent of demand. Mucilaginous gums are produced in the woods and jungles in inexhaustible quantities, varying in kind from the best African gums; and there are some not considered inferior\\(^3\\) in quality to them. Of gum resins, the most worth notice is that yielded by the Boswellia thurifera, considered to be the olibanum of the ancients. Deccamully, a resin yielded in great quantities by several species of Gardenia, is much used in native pharmacy, and probably might serve important purposes in the arts, but its properties have not been adequately tested. Some sorts of nuts abundantly yield oils, which might prove important articles of commerce. Cordage is supplied by the common sunn-plant (Crotalaria juncea), also by some species of Bauhinia, and of admirable quality by Asclepias tenassissima. Caoutchouc is yielded by several forest-growths. Of timber, the teak (Tectona grandis) produced in this territory is stunted and indifferent; but teak of fine quality is floated down\\(^4\\) the river from the forests of Nagpore. Other valuable woods are Diospyros melanoxylon and Dalbergia or sisu.\n\nThere are no returns of the amount of population, but its relative density is probably not very low, as the soil is on an average fertile, the climate good. If the relative density be assumed at 120 to the square mile, the aggregate will be 10,666,080 persons. In the south-eastern part of the territory, the Teeloogoo language prevails, and the population are generally Telingas; in the north-eastern part, the Gond language and population are general. The Mahrattas are most numerous in the west. The Mussulmans are chiefly to be met with about the capital, and everywhere in the civil and in the\n\n\\(^2\\) Journ. As. Soc.

The Telingas, though not in general in a highly advanced state of civilization, are by no means sunk in barbarism. They generally inhabit straggling villages, in houses built of mud, with pyramidal roofs of palmyra-leaves, though a few dwellings are more substantially constructed of brick, and tiled. In some of the less-civilized parts, the habitations are mere sheds of palmyra-leaves, or hovels made of bamboos and wattle. There is usually to each village a detached fort, constructed either of masonry or mud, of about fifty yards square, and containing the dwellings of the zemindar and his immediate dependants. There is a considerable number of Brahmins among the Telingas, and the diet of these, and the higher classes in general, consists of rice, wheat, vegetable curries, cakes flavoured with garlic or assaf\u0153tida, and fried in butter. The Brahmins profess to abstain from animal food, but the zemindars of the Coombee caste consume mutton, poultry, and game. The lower orders are obliged to subsist on ragi and other inferior sorts of grain; all are addicted to intoxication with the fermented sap of various kinds of palms, and spirit distilled from the flowers of the madhu (Bassia latifolia). Tobacco is in general use both for smoking and chewing, as well as in the form of snuff. Bang, or the intoxicating narcotic obtained from hemp, and opium, are also in use, but to no great extent. The Gonds lurk in the hills and fastnesses: they are a wild and savage race; yet it is stated that they may be rendered tractable and obedient by kind treatment. At present, the majority are nearly in a state of nature, sheltering in caves or hollow trees, and feeding on game when obtainable; at other times on vermin, reptiles, and wild roots or fruits.\n\nThe revenue of the Nizam is stated at 1,550,000L. The cities and places of chief note, viz., Hyderabad the capital, Secunderabad, Jaulna, Jaafarabad, Beder, Janur or Chinur, Ellichpoor, Doulatabad, Golconda, Nirmal, Nander, Palensha, and Warangol, are described under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe military roads are in general good, especially in the granitic tracts, where the prevailing material is easily beaten into a smooth, sound, durable surface. The principal routes are,\u20141. From north to south, from Nagpore, through the city of Hyderabad, to Bangalore; 2. from south-east to north-west,\nHYDERABAD.\n\nfrom Madras and Masulipatam, through the city of Hyderabad, to Poona, and thence to Bombay; 3. from south-east to north-west, from the city of Hyderabad to Aurungabad.\n\nThe subsidiary force maintained by the British government under the terms of the treaty with the Nizam, concluded in the year 1800, consists of 10,628 men.* The Nizam's military force consists of four separate descriptions of troops:\u20141. The auxiliary force, organized under British officers, as a substitute for the contingent of 6,000 infantry and 9,000 cavalry. This force, consisting of 8,000 men, is composed of regular troops, officered from the Company's army, and paid by the Nizam's government. 2. The irregular troops, consisting of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, amounting to 16,000 men. 3. A miscellaneous irregular force, composed of Arabs, Scindees, Moguls, and Seiks, amounting to nearly 10,000; and, 4. the troops maintained by ameers and others from revenues assigned by government for their support, consisting of 4,749 men.\n\nTo deduce from the earliest available sources the history of the countries which constitute the dominions of the Nizam, would require more space than could be spared for the purpose in such a compilation as the present. The Nizam himself derives his authority from a chief named Azof Jah, who held high command under Aurengzebe, and who, while nominally bearing allegiance to that sovereign, and administering the government of the Deccan as his viceroy, actually established himself there as an independent prince. This chief, known as Nizam-ool-Moolk (Regulator of the State), died in 1748, at the age of upwards of 100 years, and the right of succession to his power and authority was fiercely contested among his descendants. The claimants most favoured were two. One of these, Nazir Jung, the second son of the deceased ruler, being on the spot\n\n* 6 regiments of native infantry, at 948 .................. 5,688\n  2 ,, of light cavalry at 1,290 ...................... 2,580\n  1 troop European horse-artillery ..................... 416\n  1 ,, native ,, .................................. 404\n  1 company European foot-artillery .................... 211\n  1 ,, Golaundaze .................................. 231\n  1 Queen's regiment foot ............................. 1,098\n\n10,628\nHYDERABAD.\n\nwhen his father died, had seized the treasure, and obtained the support of the army; and, moreover, fortified his claim by an alleged renunciation of the right of succession on the part of his elder brother. The other, named Mozuffer Jung, was a grandson of Nizam-ool-Moolk, by a favourite daughter; and to him it was said the succession was conveyed by testamentary bequest. Each of these two candidates had the good fortune to secure the countenance and support of one of the great European powers then commencing their career of contention for supremacy in the East; the English espousing the cause of Nazir Jung, the French, that of his rival Mozuffer Jung; but after a very brief period, dissensions between the commander and his officers caused the retirement of the French force from the field; and Mozuffer Jung, deprived of its support, became the prisoner of Nazir Jung. Differences now arose between the latter and his English allies, and their assistance was withdrawn. Nazir Jung subsequently gave himself up to idleness and sensual pleasure; a majority of the officers of his army, seduced by the French, fell from their allegiance, and by the hand of one of them, he perished in a conflict with a body of French troops, which had mustered to attack his camp. Mozuffer Jung was now undisputed viceroy of the Deccan, exercising his authority, however, under the control of the French commander Dupleix, whose will was supreme. But Mozuffer Jung was not destined long to enjoy even the appearance of power. He fell in an affray with some Patan chiefs, who, having been instrumental in placing him on the throne, were disappointed in the amount of reward to which they thought their services entitled. A new occupant of the seat of power was now to be sought; and the French, passing over an infant son of Mozuffer Jung, selected Salabut Jung, a brother of Nazir Jung, to be ruler of the Deccan. A new claimant for the dignity, however, shortly afterwards appeared, in the person of Ghazee-ood-deen, the eldest son of Nizam-ool-Moolk, who advanced to Aurungabad at the head of a large army, to assert the right which Nazir Jung alleged to have been renounced. Salabut Jung, aided by the French, prepared for resistance; but the impending contest between the brothers was averted by the sudden death of the elder, Ghazee-ood-deen, brought about, it has been said, by poison; and though the\nHYDERABAD.\n\nMahrattas by whom he was supported, continued for their own purposes to maintain hostilities, their unvarying ill-success disposed them to listen to proposals for procuring their absence on the usual terms. The English and French, however, continued to struggle for power and influence in the Deccan; but the latter were compelled, after a while, by the danger of their own possessions, to withdraw from the support of Salabut Jung, who, thus weakened, and apprehensive, moreover, of the designs of a younger brother, Nizam Ali, entered into an engagement by which he promised to dismiss the French from his country and service, and renounce all connection with them. In 1761, this weak prince was de-throned by his youngest brother, Nizam Ali, whom, contrary to the advice of the most judicious of his French counsellors, he had intrusted with power, which was used to supplant the donor. Two years afterwards, the usurper made further acknowledgment of his brother's favour, by putting him to death. In 1765, he ravaged the Carnatic, exercising in his course a measure of cruelty far beyond what was necessary to his purpose; but he retired on the approach of a British force. Still, the British government was anxious to be on better terms with him, partly from apprehension of his future hostility in alliance with other powers as unscrupulous as himself, and partly from a desire to obtain his concurrence to their retention of a maritime district known by the name of the Northern Circars, formerly possessed by the French, but now occupied by the English, who had fortified their right by the firman of the emperor.\n\nNizam Ali was straitened for money (an infirmity which has clung to the Hyderabad state to the present time), and, in 1766, a new treaty was concluded, not unacceptable to either party, under which the East-India Company engaged to \"have a body of their troops ready to settle the affairs of his highness's government, in everything that is right and proper,\" subject, however, to withdrawal when their own possessions, or the peace and tranquillity of the Carnatic, might be in danger, and to pay, as a consideration for the free gift of the Circars, a sum of five lacs every year in which the assistance of their troops should not be required. There were other stipulations; and among them one reserving the life-right of Bazalut Jung,\nHYDERABAD.\n\na brother of Nizam Ali, in one of the Circars, subject to his good behaviour. The aid of British troops was afforded, as provided by the treaty, to enable Nizam Ali to proceed against Hyder Ali Khan, then rapidly rising into power; but, after a good deal of vacillation, Nizam Ali preferred to unite with that adventurer. The allies, however, were unprosperous, and the Nizam was compelled to sue for peace, which was concluded by a new treaty in 1768. By the sixth article, the East-India Company and the nabob of the Carnatic (who was a party to the treaty) were to be always ready to send two battalions of sepoys, and six pieces of artillery manned by Europeans, whenever the Nizam should require them, and the situation of affairs would allow of such assistance being rendered, the Nizam paying the expense during the time such force should be employed in this service. In 1782, Bazalut Jung died; but the Company did not obtain possession of the circar held by him till 1788. The peishcush, or payment to be made to the Nizam on account of the Circars, had fallen into arrear, and was not adjusted till even a later period. These matters, however, having been at length arranged, the British governor-general, Lord Cornwallis, in 1789, addressed a letter to the Nizam, explaining and interpreting the treaty of 1768, but declining to enter into any new treaty, as had been suggested. This letter of the Governor-General's was subsequently declared, by a resolution of the House of Commons, to have been meant, and to have had the full force of a treaty executed in due form. In this letter, the Governor-General agreed that the force stipulated for in the sixth article of the treaty of 1768 should be granted whenever applied for, provided it was not to be employed against any power in alliance with the Company. In the following year, on the breaking out of the war with Tippoo, son of Hyder Ali, a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance was concluded between the Nizam, the Peishwa, and the British government. Tippoo purchased peace at the sacrifice of half his dominions, and the Nizam had no reason to be dissatisfied with his share of the spoil. At a later period, the Nizam, being engaged in war with the Mahrattas, claimed the assistance of the British government under the subsisting relations between them; but the Governor-General, Sir John Shore, refused to afford it, and the Nizam was consequently\nHYDERABAD.\n\nobliged to conclude an ignominious peace with his enemy. This refusal, and its results, so incensed the Nizam, that he requested that two battalions, stationed at his capital as a subsidiary force, should be withdrawn. The Nizam now sought safety in the entertainment of a party of Frenchmen, who, however, were dismissed, in accordance with the provisions of a treaty concluded in 1798, under the administration of the earl of Mornington, afterwards Marquis Wellesley, who was most anxious to rid India of all French influence. By this treaty, a subsidiary force, augmented to 6,000 sepoys, with a due proportion of field-pieces, was assigned to the service of the Nizam. On the fall of Tippoo Sultan, and the annihilation of the state of Seringapatam, the Nizam participated largely in the division of its territory, under the partition treaty of 1799, and his share was increased on the Peishwa's withdrawal from the treaty. In 1800, the subsidiary force with the Nizam was further augmented, and the pecuniary payment for its maintenance was commuted for a cession of territory. The territory ceded for this purpose consisted of the acquisitions made from Tippoo allotted to the Nizam, under the treaty of Seringapatam in 1792, and the treaty of Mysore, concluded in 1799, after the destruction of Tippoo's power and government. Thus the Nizam secured the future defence of his person and state, without any sacrifice either of money, or of any portion of his original dominions, the territory assigned for payment of the subsidiary force having been acquired under the protection and influence of the power which now undertook to maintain his authority by means which itself had placed at his disposal. In 1804, on the conclusion of the first Mahratta war, the Nizam obtained further territorial advantages, and at the termination of the second, in 1817, certain exchanges between the Company and himself took place, some of them made for mutual convenience, others to gratify the Nizam's wishes. The precise position of the Nizam, in regard to the British government, is determined by the treaties above referred to, and it does not materially differ from that of other states with which that government maintains subsidiary alliances. Nizam Ali, of whom mention by no means to his honour has been made in the course of this narrative, closed a long and guilty life in 1803. He was succeeded by his son Secunder Jah, with whom\nHYDERABAD.\n\nthe Company confirmed all existing treaties. His feeble and unprosperous rule was terminated by his death in 1829, when he was succeeded by his eldest but illegitimate son, to whom the existing engagements were again confirmed. Under this prince the misgovernment of the country has continued and increased. A host of mercenary troops, entertained by him, so far from contributing to the purpose of defence, have been a terror both to government and people; the administration of justice, or even the semblance of it, was almost unknown, while debt, public and private, was allowed to accumulate to an enormous extent. The British government was at one time creditor for arrears of payments due to it, to the amount of between five and six hundred thousand pounds. This claim, to the continued increase of which there seemed no probable limit, was strongly pressed on the notice of the Nizam's government, and its arrangement was at length effected by a territorial cession, the revenues of the districts thus sequestrated being applicable both to the reduction of the debt, and the maintenance of the Nizam's military contingent.\n\nHYDERABAD,* the principal place in the territory of the Nizam, is situate on the river Mussi, here between 400 and 500 feet wide. The environs have a wild but highly picturesque appearance, being overspread with granite hills and isolated rocks, some of hemispherical form, others of cubical or columnar. Approached from the west, the appearance of Hyderabad is very striking: \"The palace and numerous mosques rising above the surrounding buildings, give it an air of grandeur, which is much strengthened by the very superb pile of building erected as the British Residency.\" The town is feebly fortified by a wall of stone, too weak to stand a moment against battering-guns, though adequate for protection against predatory attacks. The ground plan inclosed by the wall is a trapezoid, the longest or north-western side of which, extending along the right bank of the river Mussi, is about two miles and three-quarters in length; the southeastern, two miles; the southern, one mile; the south-western, one and three-quarters. There is a considerable suburb on the left side of the river, and in this quarter is situate the British\n\n* Haidarabad, Lion-town, or Haidar-town; Haidar, being either a proper name, or meaning \"lion.\"\nHYDERABAD.\n\nResidency, the communication between it and the city and palace being maintained by a handsome stone bridge. This fine structure, planned and executed by a British officer* in 1831, is built\\(^6\\) of squared granite stone, and has eight arches, semielliptical, each of fifty-six feet span and eighteen feet rise, with piers ten feet wide; the breadth of the bridge being twenty-four feet. There is, besides, on the left or northern side, a land-arch of seventy-seven feet span and sixteen feet rise. The total cost was 10,200l. \"The city\\(^7\\) is crowded with buildings of all descriptions, from the stately and stupendous palaces of the nobility and other men of rank and wealth, to the low and dirty hovels of the poor. The construction of the houses of the great is entirely native, displaying little or no taste. They are erected too close to each other, rendering their situations unpleasantly confined, if not unhealthy.\" The streets, some of which are paved with stone, are in general narrow. In addition to the water of the Mussi, the place is abundantly supplied from numerous wells, in various parts of the town. Besides the palace of the Nizam (a large building in the usual style of native grandeur), the most remarkable structures are the principal mosque and the British Residency. The mosque is a large stone edifice, built after the model of the Kaaba of Mecca, but devoid of ornament or any architectural beauty. The British Residency \"consists\\(^8\\) of a basement story of arches, and two others above it with wings, connected by a continuation of the basement story of arches, finished with a balustrade. The principal front is distinguished by an enormous portico of the Corinthian order, decidedly too large for the building. On the three points of the pediment are three statues, and in the centre the Company's arms in alto-rilievo. The Corinthian columns are formed of white chunam, beautifully polished, and extend from the base, which is on the summit of a noble flight of twenty-two steps, to the top of the upper story. On each side of this flight of steps stands a colossal sphinx. The interior of the portico, the cornices, &c., are ornamented in the richest style of Grecian architecture, executed in white chunam, and forming most appropriate and elegant decorations, the pavement beneath being of black and\n\n* Major Oliphant, now (1853) deputy-chairman of the East-India Company.\n\n\\(^6\\) Journ.

There is a large court in front, with a circular basin of water in the centre, stocked with aquatic birds, and planted round with various fruit-bearing and other trees: the whole is inclosed by a wall, with two gateways.\" The state apartments are on the upper story, and form a suite superb beyond description. There is perhaps more of splendour than of good taste displayed in the style of decoration; but they are admirably adapted to delight the natives. Of the antiquities of the city, the most remarkable is the Chaur Manar, or Four Minarets, a curious relic of the past, raised upon the spot where the four principal streets of the city meet. It is built upon four grand arches, through which the thoroughfares run, and above are several stories of apartments, formerly employed for academic purposes, each being a seminary for the study of different arts and sciences. No longer, however, a seat of learning, these chambers are now turned into warehouses. Above, and towering on high, rise the four lofty minarets, whence the building derives its name.* The effect of the whole, from either of the four streets, is very grand and striking. In the environs of the city are many fine gardens, containing gorgeous pavilions. Among them, that of the minister of the Nizam is represented as marvellously beautiful. \"It is inclosed, after the Asiatic manner, by high walls, the centre containing a large marble basin filled with water, and fed by numerous fountains, their silvery columns being mingled with stately cypress-trees. The pavilions, galleries, and terraces around are built and ornamented in the richest style of Oriental architecture, that beautiful carved trellis-work, which always produces so exquisite an effect, frequently intervening, while the painting and gilding are equally profuse and striking.\"\n\nThe country about Hyderabad abounds with fine tanks or artificial pieces of water of great dimensions. One, called Husain Sagur, four miles north of the city, and close to the British cantonment of Secunderabad, is about three miles in length and two in breadth; another, a few miles to the south, is stated to be twenty miles in circuit.\n\nThere is no tolerable approximation to a trustworthy estimate of the population, which probably does not exceed\n\n* Chahar Minar, \"four turrets;\" from Chahar, \"four,\" and Manar, \"turret, or minaret.\"\nHYD.\n\n200,000, of whom a large proportion are Mussulmans.

Lat. 24\u00b0 30', long. 83\u00b0 59'.\n\nHYDRABAD, in Sinde, was formerly considered the principal town of that country, in consequence of its having been selected as the residence of the chief ameers, or those ruling the southern and principal part of the country. It is situate four miles E. of the eastern bank of the Indus, on an eminence of the low rocky range called the Gunjah Hills, and in an island inclosed between the Indus and the Fulailee, a branch which, leaving the main stream about twelve miles above the town, communicates with it about fifteen miles below. The Fulailee flows about 1,000 yards east of the town, the base of the rampart being washed by a creek from it in the season of inundation, though the whole branch is dry when the river is low. This fortress, which was esteemed very strong by the Sindians, and would no doubt prove so in their mode of warfare, was built nearly on the site of the ancient Nerunkot, by Futteh Ali, the first ameer. The outline is irregular, corresponding with the winding shape of the hill's brow, on the very edge of which the walls, for the greater part of their extent, rise to the height of from fifteen to thirty feet. They are built of burnt bricks, and are thick and solid at the base, but taper so much, and are so greatly weakened by embrasures and loopholes with which they are pierced, that a few well-directed shot would demolish any part, and expose the defenders to the fire of the assailants. The ramparts are flanked by round towers or lofty bastions, at intervals of 300 or 400 paces, which, combined with the height of the hill, give the place an imposing appearance. Where the walls do not rise immediately from the\nedge of the declivity, the defence is strengthened by a ditch of ten feet wide and eight deep. The rock is too soft to admit of being scarped, and slopes so gently, that if the wall were breached, the rubbish would rest on the face of the hill, and afford footing for a storming-party. The plateau of the hill on which Hydrabad is built, is a mile and a half long and 700 yards broad; the height is about eighty feet, and on the southern part are the fortress and the suburbs or pettab. There are about 5,000 houses, meanly constructed of mud, one-half of that number being within the fortress, the rest in the pettab. The fortress contained the residence of the ameers, and a massive tower built as the repository of their treasures. The bazar is extensive, forming one street the entire length of the town; and it displays considerable bustle and appearance of business. The most important manufacture of Hydrabad is that of arms of various kinds, matchlocks, swords, spears, and shields; and the skill of the workmen is said to be scarcely inferior to that attained in Europe. There is also a considerable manufacture of ornamental silks and cottons. A cemetery, which over-spreads the northern part of the eminence, contains the tombs of the deceased members of the Talpoor dynasty, and of the preceding one of the Kaloras. That of Gholam Shah Kalora is a beautiful quadrangular building, with a handsome central dome. It is lined with fine marble, is highly ornamented with mosaic, and inscribed with sentences from the Koran. The tomb of the late Ameer Kurum Ali is also a handsome quadrangular building, surmounted by a dome, and having a turret on each corner. When the Belooches, under the conduct of Futeh Ali, of the Talpoor tribe, overthrew the Kalora dynasty, that successful chieftain gave to one branch of his relatives Khyerpoor, with a considerable district attached; to another, Meerpoor, and allowed his three brothers to share with himself the government of Hydrabad and its dependent territory, comprehending the greater part of the country. Sir C. Napier entered this place on the 20th February, 1843, having previously received the submission of six of the ameers of Sinde. On the 24th he marched out to give battle to Sheer Mahomed of Meerpore, who yet remained in arms, and was posted in great force behind a neighbouring nullah, which had been partially fortified. The ameer was, however, attacked and defeated; the\nHYD\u2014IHU.\n\nBritish force being thus enabled to advance upon Meerpore. Hyderabad is supposed to have a population of 24,000.

The late chief was greatly burdened with debt, and his jaghire had become a prey to usurers.

India is bounded on the north by the Himalaya Mountains, dividing it from Thibet. The Suliman range, a continuation of the Sufeid Koh Mountains, separates it from Afghanistan and Beloochistan on the west; and parallel offshoots from the opposite extremity of the Himalaya Mountains form its frontier on the east. On all other sides, from the port of Kurrachee on the west, to the southern extremity of the Tenasserim provinces on the east, it has a maritime coast, bordered by the Bay of Bengal on the one hand, and by the Arabian Sea, or North Indian Ocean, on the other. Its greatest length, measured from Cape Comorin in the south, to the extremity of the Punjaub in the north, may be estimated at 1,830 miles, a distance which closely corresponds with its breadth, measured from Kurrachee in the west, to the extremity of Assam in the east. It lies between lat. 8\u00b0 4'\u201436\u00b0, long. 66\u00b0 44'\u201499\u00b0 30'. Within these limits is comprised an area of 1,484,367 square miles, with a population of 161,758,226.\n\nAnother chain of mountains, termed the Vindhya range, crosses the continent of India at a lower latitude, from east to west. This range unites at one of its extremities with the Eastern, and at the other with the Western Ghauta, and thus forms the base of the triangle upon which rests the table-land of the Deccan. Such is a general outline of the mountain system of India.\n\nExtensive means of inland navigation are presented in the\nnoble rivers by which the country is traversed. These may be conveniently distributed into two classes; the one deriving their chief supplies from the melted snows of the Himalayas, and the other being mainly fed by the rains of the south-west and north-east monsoons. In the one class may be ranked,\u20141. The Indus and its tributaries, consisting of the Sutlej, Beas, Ravee, Chenab, and Jhelum; 2. the Ganges and its tributaries, the chief of which are the Jumna, Gogra, Gunduck, and Cozy; 3. the Brahmapootra, with its principal feeders, the Sanpoor and the Teesta; and, 4. the Irawaddy, traversing Burmah and the recently-acquired province of Pegu. In the second class are ranged the great rivers of the Deccan; among which may be enumerated the Godavery, Kistnah, and Cauvery, together with the Nerbudda, Taptee, Mahanuddee, and various others intersecting Southern and Central India.\n\nFor political objects, as well as for administrative purposes, the British possessions in India have been distributed into several principal divisions, which, with their respective areas and population, are stated below:\n\n| Area                  | Sq. Miles | Population |\n|-----------------------|-----------|------------|\n| Bengal, including Assam and the Tenasserim Provinces | 225,103   | 41,094,825 |\n| North-Western Provinces                      | 85,593    | *23,803,349 |\n| Saugor and Nerbudda territory                | 17,538    | 2,143,599  |\n| Punjab                                | 78,447    | 4,100,983  |\n| Cis-Sutlej territory                     | 4,559     | 619,413    |\n| Pegu                                  | 28,920    | 2,000,000  |\n| Madras                               | 135,680   | 22,301,697 |\n| Bombay                              | 120,065   | 11,109,067 |\n\nTotal, exclusive of the Eastern Straits settlements, the area of which is 1,575 square miles, population 202,540\n\n* This is the result of the census of 1848; but it appears from a later return, not yet officially received, but adverted to in the Indian newspapers,\u00b9 that the total population of the North-West Provinces in 1852 amounted to 30,271,885. That such an increase could take place under ordinary circumstances in four years, is utterly impossible; but it may be observed, that under the last revenue settlement the waste lands of these\n\n\u00b9 Friend of India, Nov. 1858, p. 604.\nINDIA.\n\nIt will thus be seen that less than one-half of the superficial extent of India is strictly British, the remainder, comprising an area of 788,462 square miles, and a population of 54,585,793, is occupied by native states; among the principal of which may be enumerated Oude, Hyderabad or the dominions of the Nizam, Nagpore* or the possessions of the rajah of Berar, Guzerat or the territory of the Guicowar, Gwalior or Scindia's territory, Indore or Holcar's possessions, Mysore, Travancore, Cochin and Cutch, Nepaul, Burmah, Bhopal, Cashmere or Gholab Singh's dominions, the Rajpoot states, and a variety of others, forming in the aggregate a number falling little short of 200, and which, moreover, might be doubled by the addition of the petty chieftainships of the peninsula of Kattywar.\n\nWith the exception of Burmah, Nepaul, and one or two petty governments, the whole of these states have entered into treaties and engagements with the British government, involving the obligation of protection on the part of the paramount power, and allegiance on that of the subordinate. In some instances, the dependent state is subject to the payment of tribute; in others, it is exempt from any pecuniary claim. All have relinquished the right of self-defence, as well as that of maintaining diplomatic relations with each other; and the British government, which guarantees external protection and internal tranquillity, has been constituted the arbiter of all disputes arising between native rulers. But though debarred from the exercise of military power in regard to external aggression, the native governments are not prohibited from maintaining a separate military force; in some cases, they are required to provide such a force, which, in the event of war, is to be available to the British government against the common enemy. In some instances, the number of troops to be maintained is restricted. Under these arrangements, the existing military resources of the native princes comprise a force of provinces were exempted from assessment on the part of the government, for the entire period of the settlement (thirty years); and this would be calculated to occasion an extraordinary influx of husbandmen from the hills and parts adjacent.\n\n* Ragojee, the late rajah of Nagpore, died at the latter end of the year 1853, leaving no heir, natural or adopted. The right to adopt a successor will, however, be probably claimed on behalf of the family; and until the question be finally decided, Nagpore must be regarded as a native state.\nlittle less than 400,000 men, an amount exceeding by nearly 100,000* the numerical strength of the British army in India, inclusive of the contingent troops commanded by British officers. It may be observed, however, that considerable portions of the regular troops of native states are described in the official returns as fitted rather for police purposes than for regular military duties.\n\nIt is to be lamented, that the benefits that might have been anticipated from this indirect exercise of British authority have not been realized. Most of the protected states are wretchedly misgoverned, and there cannot be the slightest doubt that the people would be far happier as British subjects than they are now. The British provinces have been steadily advancing in prosperity; the progress of the protected states has been from bad to worse. In some cases, the reliance on British support encourages the sovereign to abandon himself to a course of personal gratification, regardless of the interests of his subjects. In all, the supremacy of a foreign power deprives him of that importance, which is necessary to command either the respect of his subjects or his own. Feeling that he is regarded as a cipher, he will not be unlikely to take the same view of his situation, and, divesting himself of all responsibility, to consider his elevated rank only as bestowing a title to unlimited indulgence\u2014an exemption from every species of care, and a license to sink into irreclaimable apathy and sensuality.\n\nThe policy of the British government in India has always been opposed to conquest. But though it is impossible not to respect their motives, it is equally impossible not to perceive, that, had they been actuated by a less-scrupulous spirit, the condition of a large portion of the people of India would have been far better than it is. Could the whole of the protected states be annexed at once to the British dominions, humanity\n\n| Artily | Cavalry | Infantry | Total | Total |\n|--------|---------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Military strength of native powers | 12,962 | 68,303 | 317,653 | .. | 398,918 |\n| Ditto, ditto, of the British Government in India | 16,440 | 34,984 | 229,406 | .. | 289,529 |\n| Add eng., med. officers, &c. | .. | .. | .. | 8,699 | .. |\n| Conting. troops of the native states, comm. by British officers | .. | .. | .. | .. | 32,311 |\n\nGrand Total | 321,840 |\nwould have cause to rejoice. Unfortunately this cannot take place without a violation of that good faith which, in all parts of the world, it has been the pride of England to maintain. Occasionally, the accumulation of abuses in these protected states becomes so enormous, that the supreme power is compelled to carry its interference beyond mere remonstrance. It is not improbable that some change will be made in the relation at present existing between Oude and the protecting power. A long course of misgovernment having reduced that kingdom to a state of anarchy, the British may perhaps find it necessary to take the administration into their own hands.\n\nIt will be evident from this view, that the British authority in India is paramount. That of the French is almost annihilated. They still occupy Pondicherry, and one or two other places of small importance; but they no longer dispute with the English the dominion of the East. The Portuguese linger in a few spots, the scenes of their former commercial grandeur; but from neither of these powers has Britain at this time anything to fear. Her rivals have fallen before her, and left her in possession of the most gigantic dominion that ever was appended to a foreign state.\n\nSo vast a region, varying, in respect to latitude and elevation, from the sea-level of the lower provinces of Bengal to the lofty summits of the Himalayas, must necessarily embrace various degrees of temperature; and in a general description of the climate of India, it is only the leading characteristics that can be noticed. The year admits of a division into three seasons,\u2014the hot, the rainy, and the temperate. The hot season commences in March, and continues till the beginning of June, when the rains, brought from the Indian Ocean by the southwest monsoon, set in, and last with occasional intermission till October, at which period the temperate weather commences, and continues till the end of February. \"In a great part of the country,\" says Elphinstone, \"the sun is scorching for three months in the year; even the wind is hot, the land is brown and parched, dust flies in whirlwinds, all brooks become dry, small rivers scarcely keep up a stream, and the largest are reduced to comparatively narrow channels, in the midst of vast sandy beds. In winter, slight frost sometimes takes place for about an hour or two about sunrise.\" \"At a low level, if\ntowards the south, the greatest cold in winter is only moderate heat.\"\n\nConsiderable interest is attached to the zoology of India. The forests contain a variety of wild animals, the most remarkable of which is the elephant. These animals associate in herds, which, emerging from the jungles, frequently occasion serious injury to the crops. They are often destroyed by parties of hunters, or caught in pits and tamed. The elephant of the Deccan is considered inferior to that of Bengal. The rhinoceros, wild buffalo, and bear, are also inhabitants of the forest. Tigers, leopards, panthers, wild boars, hyenas, wolves, and jackals, pervade both forest and jungle, and sometimes infest patches of underwood in the immediate vicinity of cultivated lands. Lions are met with only in particular tracts, and more especially in the western part of Rajpootana, the province of Guzerat, and its vicinities. Among the remainder of wild animals may be enumerated deer, antelopes, and monkeys. Crocodiles, serpents, and other reptiles are most numerous. The domestic animals are buffaloes, camels, horses, sheep, swine, oxen, and goats. Game and fish are found in abundance, as are also birds of splendid plumage.\n\nAmong the principal trees are the teak, considered superior to the oak for purposes of shipbuilding, the sal, the sissoo, and the babul. There is also the cocoanut-tree, every portion of which is rendered available to the wants of man; the fruit being serviceable as food, the husk which envelops the nut affording a fibre from which cordage is manufactured, while the wood is peculiarly adapted to the construction of water-pipes, and also of beams and rafters. Another valuable tree, yielding a fleshy flower, which is important as an article of food, and from which spirit is moreover distilled, is the mahua. Besides the above, may be enumerated the bamboo, largely employed in scaffolding, and also in the manufacture of baskets and mats; the banyan, the tamarind, and the mango, the palmyra and other palms. Sandal and ebony are found in many parts. In the Himalayas, pines abound, including the magnificent deodar; together with oaks and other forest-trees indigenous in Europe, or capable of being naturalized there.\n\nOn the banks of the Lower Ganges, and all round the seacoast of the peninsula, rice constitutes the staple food of the\n\n*Calcutta Rev.*\n\nlx. 4.\ninhabitants. Wheat is largely consumed in the north-west provinces of Bengal. The peasantry of the Deccan depend for subsistence upon jowar and bajra, or upon a small and poor grain called raggi. The last-named grains are sown at the commencement of the rains, and reaped in autumn. Wheat ripens during winter, and forms a spring crop. But, though there are thus two distinct cultivations, the tropical and temperate crops are seldom sown on the same ground in the same year, except in the rich soil of the lower provinces of Bengal, and in some other irrigated tracts, where the rice crop requires only three months to arrive at maturity. Extensive tracts of land are appropriated to the production of the staple articles of export, consisting chiefly of cotton, sugar-cane, indigo, rice, opium, tobacco, and oil-seeds; pepper and cardamums are largely cultivated on the western coast, and ginger, capsicum, cumin, coriander, and turmeric, are a common field-produce. Among the vegetables, indigenous or exotic, are yams, potatoes, carrots, onions, spinach, radishes, gourds, and cucumbers. The fruits consist of plantains or bananas, mangoes, tamarinds, guavas, jacks, melons, grapes, pine-apples, peaches, strawberries, oranges, &c.; figs are not very general; apples are devoid of flavour; pears and plums do not succeed.\n\nNumerous as are the towns and cities of India, none are remarkable for the amount of their population. That of Calcutta, independently of its suburbs, has been recently returned at 413,182.* No census has been yet taken of the population of the city of Madras;\u2020 but Bombay, with its suburbs, and including also the floating population in its harbour, contains only 566,199 inhabitants.\u00a7 Throughout the whole extent of the North-West Provinces no one city can boast a population of 200,000; Delhi \u00a7 has only 137,977, Cawnpore 108,796, Benares 183,491, Bareilly 92,208, Agra 66,003.\n\nThe towns are usually composed of high brick houses, and, with some exceptions, the streets are narrow, and badly paved. Many of these are walled, and capable of some defence. Villages vary according to locality; some being defended by walls,\n\n* See article CALCUTTA.\n\u2020 The population of the city of Madras is officially assumed at 720,000.\n\u2021 See article BOMBAY.\n\u00a7 Shakespear, Memoir on Statistics of North-West Provinces.\nothers open, or surrounded only by a fence. Each village has its temple and bazar, its annual fair and festivals. In the North-Western Provinces, the houses of the peasantry are usually built of unburnt brick, and are tiled; in Bengal the cottage has its thatched roof and cane walls; and in the Deccan the huts are either of mud or stone, with terraced roofs. Throughout India the dwelling of the peasant is scantily furnished; the principal articles consisting of a few earthen pots and brass vessels, a hand-mill, pestle and mortar, and an iron plate, on which cakes are baked. A mat is the substitute for a chair, and tables are dispensed with.\n\nThe enormous population of India is composed chiefly of two leading races, Hindoos and Mahomedans. The Hindoos, though resembling each other in their religion and in the observances and habits which it involves, are at the same time distinguished by many points of difference. Diversity in appearance, in dress, in the staple articles of food, in the mode of building, and in many other respects, is occasioned partly by local peculiarities, and partly by the nature of their institutions. The natives of Northern India are tall and fair; those of Bengal and the Deccan, small and dark: the former are manly and warlike, the latter timid and superstitious. There are also the aborigines of India, the Bheels and Coles. Some account of the former will be found under the article Candeish, and of the latter under Orissa. Bhats and Charuns, and some other tribes, are noticed under the head of Guzerat.\n\nAccording to the latest returns which are available, the gross revenues of the British government in India amount to about 27,000,000\u00a3., more than one-half of which is derived from the land. The other principal sources of revenue are customs, stamps, excise, salt, and opium. The revenue from salt is secured by a duty charged upon the prime cost of the home manufacture, and by a customs duty upon the foreign supply; the rate being the same in both cases, and amounting to about three farthings per pound. The annual revenue contributed by this article may be estimated at two millions sterling. Opium, from the poppy cultivated in the British provinces, is manufactured solely on account of government: that produced in native states is subject to a transit-duty on its passage through British territory to the coast. In both cases the tax may be\nregarded as being paid wholly by foreigners. The annual revenue from opium exceeds three millions sterling: from land, the chief source of revenue, the amount derived is more than fifteen millions sterling. The government land tenures vary in the different presidencies. In the lower provinces of Bengal, the land is held chiefly upon the zemindarry tenure. In this case, the government recognise no separation of interests; the whole estate is cultivated as a joint-stock property for the mutual benefit of the proprietors, and, after payment of the government demand, the net profits are divided among the shareholders, according to their respective shares. One individual (the representative of the proprietary body) is held responsible for the rent; and in the event of default, the whole estate is sold for its realization. In this part of India, the rent has been fixed in perpetuity, and the government are consequently debarred from further participation in the agricultural improvement of the country. In the North-Western Provinces, the land is held under putteedarree settlement. Under this mode, an estate is parcelled out into allotments, and thenceforward the shares in the net profits are commuted for equivalent portions of land. Each proprietor or shareholder undertakes the agricultural management of his separate allotment, paying through the representative of the proprietary body (the lumberdar, or perhaps the headman of the village), such instalment of the government revenue as may have been agreed to among themselves in distributing the aggregate assessment. In the event of individual default, a joint responsibility attaches to the whole proprietary body; but any proceedings instituted by the government for the realization of the deficiency, would be directed in the first instance against the defaulting allotment. The characteristic of the putteedarree tenure, is cultivation in severalty, with joint responsibility. In this part of India, the government demand has been calculated upon the basis of two-thirds of the net rent, and leases granted for periods of thirty years. By this limitation of the public demand, a valuable and marketable private property has been created in the land, and every landholder, however petty his holding, is to a certain extent a capitalist. In Bombay, the revenue settlement is chiefly ryotwar. Under the ryotwar tenure, the various proprietary subdivisions of the estate are recognised by the government,\nand joint responsibility ceases. The aggregate of the govern-\nment demand is distributed by its authority in distinct instal-\nments, corresponding with the value of each separate allotment.\nThe proprietor of each petty holding is thus made responsible\nto the government for the payment exclusively of his own fixed\nassessment. The principle of the ryotwar tenure is that of a\nfield assessment, with a total separation of interests. In this\npart of India, under the new survey now in progress, the lands\nare subdivided into fields of moderate size, so that each sub-\ndivision is rendered easy of cultivation by a farmer of limited\nmeans. The government assessment is laid separately upon each\nfield, and leases granted for thirty years' duration at a fixed and\ninvariable sum, binding on the government for the full term, but\nwith the option on the part of the cultivator of surrendering\nany one or more of his fields, or altogether putting an end to\nhis lease at the close of any given year. In Madras, a con-\nsiderable portion of the land is also held under the ryotwar\ntenure. A maximum assessment is fixed by the government\nfor the best lands, which cannot be exceeded. Inferior lands,\nso long as they remain inferior, are of course assessed at lower\nrates. The contracts with the cultivators are renewed from\nyear to year, when remissions of rent are made, if the unfavour-\nable character of the season, or the circumstances of the cul-\ntivator, render such a measure expedient. In the south of\nIndia, the seasons are usually precarious, and the cultivators\npoor and improvident. Under such circumstances, it has been\nthought there were no means of securing to the government a\nfair share of the surplus produce or net rent, except by taking\nmore than the average in favourable seasons, and making\ncorresponding reductions in those which prove unfavourable.\nAnnual settlements are therefore in this view indispensable.\nBut such a system must necessarily operate as a bar to agri-\ncultural improvement. It is obvious that, but for the remis-\nsions, the land is over-assessed. It has consequently a very\nlow marketable value. Farming capital is borrowed at enor-\nmous rates of interest, not upon the security of the land, but\nsolely upon the crop of the current year\u2014a very uncertain\none. Farming thus becomes a matter of wild speculation; and\nthe net rent is divided, not between the government and the\ncultivator, but between the government and the usurer.\nINDIA.\n\nIt is almost unnecessary to state, that the external commerce of India is carried on almost entirely with ports within the British territories. Within the last twenty years, several restrictions which impeded the growth of commerce have been removed, and India may now be said to enjoy free trade. This state of things has been brought about by\u20141st. The abolition of transit or inland duties. 2nd. The removal of export duties on the staple articles of sugar and cotton. 3rd. The equalization of duties on the cargoes of British and foreign ships. By the abolition of inland duties, the transit of produce for home consumption was rendered free, and a fresh impetus given to the internal trade of the country. By the withdrawal of export duties on sugar and cotton, the staple produce of India is enabled to compete in foreign markets with the like productions of other countries. By abolishing the distinction between British and foreign ships, the latter, previously discouraged from resorting to India by the imposition of double duties, now enter the ports of India on the same terms as their British competitors, and thus afford a vast addition to the means of transport, and an incalculable increase of facilities for its commerce. The same Act (VI. of 1848) removed the impediments which obstructed the coasting trade, by abolishing the levy of duty on goods conveyed from port to port. Further; Asiatic sailors or lascars, being natives of India, and under the government of the East-India Company, are now deemed British seamen.\n\nThe degree of expansion resulting to the commerce of India from these measures, may be seen from the following comparative statement:\n\n| Imports into India | Merchandise | Treasure | Total |\n|-------------------|------------|---------|-------|\n| 1834-35           | \u00a34,261,106 | \u00a31,898,023 | \u00a36,154,129 |\n| 1849-50           | 10,299,888 | 3,396,807 | 13,696,696 |\n\n| Exports           |            |         |       |\n|-------------------|------------|---------|-------|\n| 1834-35           | 7,993,420 | 194,740 | 8,188,160 |\n| 1849-50           | 17,312,299 | 971,244 | 18,283,543 |\n\nIt thus appears that the amount of both imports and exports in the last year is more than double that of the first; and hence\nit is clear, that while the government revenue has benefited, the people have prospered.\n\nIn so vast an extent of country, it might be presumed that wide diversity of language prevails; and such is the fact. In Upper India, the chief dialects are Hindee, Bengalee, Punjabee, Mahratta, Guzerattee, Cutchee, Boondela, Brig Bhakhur, Ooriya, and Assamese. These are all derivatives from the Sanscrit. The languages of Southern India, Teloogoo, Tannul, Canarese, Malayala, and Cingalese, are also closely dependent upon Sanscrit, the storehouse of the religious ceremonies of the Brahmin, and the language of the laws of Menu, which may be regarded as the basis of the actual civil law of the Hindoo, and the mainspring of his daily avocations. Oordoo or Hindostanee is the common language of Mahomedans throughout India, and is in fact Hindee, the primitive tongue of the Hindoos, modified by the chief languages of their Mahomedan conquerors, Arabic and Persian. Pushtoo and Sindhee are also derived from Arabic, the language which is the depository of the Mahomedan faith, and of the laws and civil regulations of those who profess it. Persian was formerly the language of the law courts of the East-India Company; but, in 1837, its use was abolished, and the vernacular of each district substituted.\n\nLittle or nothing deserving the name of education existed in India till a comparatively recent period. Near the end of the last century, the British government established a Mahomedan college at Calcutta, and a Sanscrit college at Benares; but these foundations, however well intended, did little either to inform or to enlarge the minds of those admitted to them, and taught at least as much of error as of truth. Bishop Heber says: \"The Mussulman literature very nearly resembles what the literature of Europe was before the time of Copernicus, Galileo, and Bacon. The Mussulmans take their logic from Aristotle, filtered through many successive translations and commentaries; and their metaphysical system is professedly derived from Plato. Both Mahomedans and Hindoos have the same natural philosophy, which is also that of Aristotle in zoology and botany, and Ptolemy in astronomy, for which the Hindoos have forsaken their more ancient notions of the seven seas and the six earths.\" From this state of mental thraldom,\nthe native mind could never be expected to emancipate itself without assistance. Early in the present century, more serious and more useful exertions in the cause of education began to be made. The literature and science of the western world were introduced to a great extent; and there can be no doubt that gradually, though perhaps slowly, these will supersede the trifling and deadening studies which for ages have added to the darkness of India, in place of tending to dispel it. The seminaries wherein the higher studies are pursued, may be pronounced to have been generally successful. In the attempt to improve and extend vernacular instruction, the British government, though equally zealous, has not been equally successful. The best results attained have been in the North-Western Provinces, where the new revenue settlement, under which the rights of every individual interested in the land became matter of record, has afforded precisely the stimulus required. The desire to ascertain and to preserve their recognised rights, induces in the people a desire for the acquisition of the arts of reading, writing, arithmetic, and mensuration. A few other of the simpler elements of knowledge are found to be easily added; and perhaps no great number of years will elapse before the mass of the people in the provinces above named will be well instructed in those branches of knowledge which are more immediately necessary; while those who have advanced somewhat farther, will not be few.\n\nAmong the great public works which have more recently been undertaken in India, may be mentioned the Ganges Canal, full particulars of which are given under the article Ganges River. Measures are likewise in progress for establishing a comprehensive scheme of railway lines, to constitute the main arteries of communication throughout the country. Commencing at Calcutta, a railroad is now under construction, via Rajmahal and the valley of the Ganges, to Delhi; to be thence extended to the north-west frontier. A line, from Bombay in a north-easterly direction, will form a junction with the Calcutta line, probably either at Allahabad or Agra; while the cotton districts of Berar will be connected with the western coast by a branch from the Bombay line. It is further proposed to connect by railway the presidency towns of Bombay and Madras, in the direction of Poona and\nBellary, while the eastern and western coasts of the more southern part of the peninsula will be linked together by a line from Madras to Ponany. Electric telegraph lines are also in course of construction, whereby the means of instantaneous communication will be secured, not only between the presidency towns, but between all the principal military and civil stations of the country, from the Punjaub to Pegu.\n\nThe early history of India is involved in extreme obscurity, and fable has in consequence usurped the place of fact. The ridiculous fictions which the Hindoos dignify with the name of history, are unworthy not only of belief, but even of grave consideration. Little of either pleasure or information would be afforded by a detailed account of the solar and lunar dynasties, or an investigation of the accuracy of chronicles which carry us back through countless ages. Our best information is derived from the Greeks; and until the conquests of Alexander, they were acquainted with India only through vague and meagre reports obtained from the Persians. Alexander passed the different rivers of the Punjaub, and advanced towards the Ganges, which, however, he was not destined to reach. The narratives of his followers are admitted to be, in some respects, discordant; and though, previous to the time of Ptolemy, the spirit of commercial adventure had added something to the stock of information, the knowledge of India possessed by the Greeks must be regarded as both scanty and inaccurate; but though unsatisfactory, it is sufficient to show that the people to whom it relates are almost unchanged by the lapse of centuries. Even the minute features of the national character are at this time the same that they were two thousand years ago.\n\nThough capable of being trained into efficient soldiers, the natives of India have not been fortunate in maintaining their independence, and they have generally afforded an easy triumph to a bold and determined invader. A large portion of their country was subject to the Persian monarchy; to Alexander they offered some resistance, but his conquests were effected in no long space of time; and at a later period they became, first tributaries, and ultimately subjects, of the victorious disciples of Mahomet.\n\nPreviously to the invasion of the Moguls, the Mahometan\nhistory of India possesses slender interest, and is, perhaps, little to be relied on. For a considerable time after that event, it offers but a picture of those commotions and crimes which characterize a state of society in which conflicting parties are struggling for the sovereignty. The most remarkable person of this period was Timur or Tamerlane; a man who, though exhibited by an English poet* as a model of clemency, as well as of heroism, had little pretension to the former quality. His conquests extended from the Irtisch and Volga to the Persian Gulf, and from the Ganges to the Archipelago. He even meditated the invasion of China, and had made vast preparations for an expedition against that country, when death intercepted his career. His courage, perseverance, and military skill are indisputable; but, unfortunately, his cruelty is not less so.\n\nThe death of Timur took place about ninety years before the arrival of the Portuguese in India by the south-east passage, the discovery of which was to effect a revolution in the destinies of the country, compared with which all previous changes were unimportant. The great mass of commerce between India and Europe was carried on by the route of the Red Sea, until the seventh century, when the conquest of Egypt by the Saracens transferred it by the Black Sea to Constantinople. When, however, the Mamelukes became masters of Egypt, they permitted the Venetians to resume the ancient route; and Alexandria was thenceforward the sole entrep\u00f4t of Indian trade.\n\nThe spirit of Portuguese discovery received its impulse from the genius of Prince Henry, youngest son of John I. of Portugal. Under his countenance, naval adventure became popular; but the progress of discovery was greatly impeded by the imperfect state of navigation. The first acquisition was but of small importance, consisting only of the little island of Puerto Santo. It was sufficient, however, to encourage confidence, and stimulate to further exertions, and a subsequent expedition was rewarded by the discovery of the rich and beautiful island of Madeira.\n\nAfter a tedious succession of voyages continued for nearly half a century, Vasco di Gama, an active and enterprising\n\n* Rowe.\nINDIA.\n\nPortuguese admiral, doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and, coasting along the eastern shore of the continent of Africa, sailed from thence across the Indian Ocean, and landed at Calicut, on the coast of Malabar. At the period of his arrival, the west coast of Hindostan was divided between two great sovereigns, the king of Cambay and the Zamorin, each of whom had under him numerous petty princes. The dominions of the Zamorin included the whole coast from Bombay to Cape Comorin; but the attempts of De Gama to conclude a commercial treaty with this power were frustrated by the jealousy of the Mahometan merchants, and he returned to Lisbon. His successor, Cabral, was not more fortunate; and in consequence he proceeded to Cochin and Cananore. The kings of these places were dependants upon the Zamorin: a dependency from which they were anxious to be emancipated. By them Cabral was very favourably received; and in an incredibly short time, the Portuguese acquired a paramount influence over the whole coast. Previously, however, to the arrival of Albuquerque in 1508, they were not possessed of a good port. After a violent struggle, they secured and fortified Goa, which from thenceforth became the capital of the Portuguese settlements, and the point from whence they spread their conquests and their commerce over the Eastern seas.\n\nThe Venetians and the sultan of Egypt, who were the principal sufferers by the diversion of the commerce of the East into a new channel, made some ineffectual attempts, in conjunction with the king of Cambay, to dispossess the Portuguese of their conquests; but the latter not only maintained their superiority, but succeeded in acquiring the command of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The trade by those routes consequently ceased, and feeling secure from competition, the Portuguese proceeded to push their success. In the course of a few years they established a commercial empire of unprecedented extent, splendour, and opulence; they commanded the east coast of Africa, the coasts of Arabia and Persia, the two peninsulas of India, the Moluccas, Ceylon, and the trade to China and Japan. They levied tribute upon a hundred and fifty native princes, and claimed a right to sweep from the Indian seas every vessel that sailed without their permission. Of all this mighty dominion, a miserable remnant is all that\nINDIA.\n\nnow exists, and that remnant depressed, impoverished, and almost in a state of estrangement from the mother country.\n\nThe annexation of Portugal to the crown of Spain was fatal to the colonial dominion of the former country, and the Dutch occupy the next conspicuous place in the commercial history of India. They had originally been contented with the carrying-trade between Lisbon and the north of Europe; but Philip II. having put an end to this trade, they endeavoured to repair their loss by the discovery of a passage to India by the northward. Failing in this attempt, they embraced the proposal of Hautman, a prisoner for debt at Lisbon, to reveal to them the knowledge he possessed of Indian navigation and commerce, on condition of his liberation. Four ships were despatched to India under the command of Hautman, in the year 1594, and a sanguinary war with the Portuguese soon followed. Success was long doubtful; but the Dutch ultimately triumphed. The Portuguese at first lost Malacca and Ceylon; they were subsequently driven from various settlements on the coast of Malabar; and not long afterwards the native princes permitted the Dutch to establish factories at Negapatam, Sadras, Pulicat, and Bimlipatam, on the east coast. From this period the power of Portugal in the East was rapidly approaching to extinction.\n\nThe spirit of rivalry to the Portuguese was not confined to the Dutch. The splendid results which had followed the discovery of the south-east passage could scarcely fail to excite the emulation of a maritime and enterprising nation like the English. Two attempts were made in the reign of Henry VIII. to explore a north-west passage, and one in the reign of Edward VI. to discover a passage by the north-east. Many similar attempts followed within a short space of time, but all with the same want of success. There seemed, therefore, no alternative but to renounce the glittering visions of oriental wealth, or to follow them in the same track which the Portuguese had so successfully pursued. The first attempt to proceed by the south-east was, however, unprosperous. After encountering some Spanish men-of-war on the coast of Brazil, the expedition was obliged to return, for want of provisions. The second expedition was still more unfortunate; the ships,\nthree in number, were driven on the coast of Spanish America, and the crews, with the exception of four men, perished.\n\nThe more fortunate expeditions of Drake and Cavendish, and their flattering reports of the wealth of the countries which they had visited, kept alive the national ardour for a participation in the Indian trade; and the fact of the Dutch having resolved on contending with the Portuguese for a share of this coveted traffic, determined the English to follow their example. An association was formed and a fund subscribed for the purpose, and a memorial presented to the government, setting forth the places with which the Spanish and Portuguese had established intercourse, and pointing out others to which the English might resort without affording ground of complaint to their predecessors. Some difficulties were interposed by the government on account of a treaty then pending with Spain, but permission was given to make preparations for a voyage, while the patent of incorporation was under consideration. The government of the day appears to have been not indisposed to share in the patronage created by the adventure, and recommended Sir Edward Mitchelbourne to be employed in the expedition. The answer of the directors affords a memorable proof of their independence, and must be regarded as peculiarly honourable to them, when it is considered that they were at the time petitioners to the throne for a charter. On consultation, they resolved \"not to employ any gentleman in any place of charge, and requested that they might be allowed to sorte their business with men of their own qualitye, lest the suspiceon of the employmt of gentlemen being taken hold upon by the generalitie, do dryve a greate number of the adventurers to withdraw their contributions.\"\n\nGreatly to the honour of the government, the honest resistance offered to its interference was not permitted to prejudice the cause of the adventurers, and on the last day of the year 1600, they were by letters-patent from the queen constituted a body politic and corporate, by the title of \"The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading to the East-Indies.\" The government of the Company was vested in a committee of twenty-four and a chairman. It was empowered to trade to all places beyond the Cape of Good Hope and the\nINDIA.\n\nStraits of Magellan for fifteen years, with the exception of places in possession of princes in amity with the queen, whose objection should be publicly declared; and all other the queen's subjects were prohibited from interfering with the Company's exclusive trade, except by license granted under their common seal. From James I. a renewal of the charter was obtained, by which all preceding privileges of the Company were confirmed, and they were constituted a body corporate for ever.\n\nThe early voyages of the Company were confined to the islands of the Indian Ocean; but after the confirmation and extension of their charter by James, they proceeded to establish a commercial intercourse with the Asiatic continent. Their endeavours were of course opposed by the Portuguese; but the English Company finally succeeded in establishing factories on various parts of the coast. One of their earliest settlements was at Surat, and this factory, with that at Bantam, remained for a long period their principal stations.\n\nIn the Dutch, the English Company found enemies more formidable than the Portuguese. The Dutch were bent on securing a monopoly of the spice-trade, and they enforced it in the most unscrupulous and vindictive spirit. After a long course of hostility, relieved by some weak and inefficient attempts at pacification, the spirit of the whole British people, with the exception of their sovereign, was roused to the highest pitch of indignation by the atrocious proceedings at Amboyna. The Dutch having determined on obtaining the exclusive possession of the island, fabricated a plot, to afford them a pretext for effecting their purpose. The plot, it was pretended, was confessed by two soldiers in the Dutch service, one a Japanese, the other a Portuguese, who had been put to the torture. Upon this evidence the English were apprehended, imprisoned, loaded with irons, and their books and property seized. A mock trial followed, in the course of which the prisoners were subjected to the most varied and horrible tortures, for the purpose of extorting confession. It is unnecessary to say that this mode of examination was successful. Confession was of course followed by conviction\u2014conviction by execution; and the commercial interests of the Dutch were cemented by the blood of the accused persons. The pretence of a conspiracy was too absurd to deceive even the most credulous. When the\nbureaux of the factors were opened and their papers rifled, no traces of such conspiracy were discovered. The number of English on the island did not exceed twenty, while the Dutch had a garrison of three hundred men in the fort, and several other garrisons in the island. The English were not only few in number, but they were unprovided with arms and ammunition. They had not a single ship, whereas the Dutch had eight lying off the town of Amboyna. A conspiracy against the Dutch authorities, under such circumstances, could have been formed only by men labouring under insanity; and those who professed to believe in its existence, had they been sincere, would have justly fallen under the same imputation. It would be idle to say a word in refutation of a mode of trial from which common sense and humanity alike recoil. The torture procured for the Dutch authorities that which they wanted\u2014a legal excuse for the condemnation of their victims; but the courage of the sufferers revived as they approached a more righteous tribunal, and on the awful verge of eternity they solemnly protested their innocence. Those who will deliberately commit the graver crime of murder, will of course not hesitate at the comparatively light one of robbery. Massacre was not unnaturally followed by confiscation, and the Dutch retained English property to an immense amount. Its value has been stated at 400,000l. The truckling policy of James deterred him from seeking reparation of this great national wrong, and the disturbed reign of Charles allowed the Dutch a prolonged period of impunity; but the honour of the country was in some degree vindicated by Oliver Cromwell, who required and obtained payment of a large sum in satisfaction of the pecuniary injury inflicted.\n\nAt this time all the factories in the tract extending from Cape Comorin to the Persian and Arabian Gulfs, were controlled by the presidency of Surat. On the coast of Coromandel the Company had established themselves in the first instance at Masulipatam. Subsequently they left that place for Armegum. Finally they settled at Madraspatam, where, by permission of the native government, they erected Fort St. George, now the seat of one of the British presidencies.\n\nThe connections of the Company with Bengal were formed gradually. The first privilege which they obtained from the court\nof Delhi was that of free resort to the port of Pipley, a privilege afterwards much extended, through the intervention of a surgeon named Boughton, who acquired influence at the imperial court by the exercise of his professional skill. Factories were accordingly established at Hooghley, Cossimbazar, Balasore, Patna, and Malda. Of these Hooghley was chief; but the whole of them were subordinate to Fort St. George.\n\nThe accession of Charles II. to the throne was followed by a renewal of the charter of the Company, by which their former privileges were confirmed, and authority conveyed to them to make peace and war with any people, not being Christians, and to seize unlicensed persons within their limits, and send them to England. From the same prince they obtained a grant of the island of Bombay, which he had received as part of the marriage portion of Catherine of Portugal. This island, now the seat of a presidency, was on its first acquisition subordinate to Surat.\n\nThough the British interest in India was on the whole progressive, its advance was not uninterrupted. A civil war in Bantam was the means of excluding the English from Java, while the factories of Surat and Bombay were disturbed by unremitting war between the Mogul and the Mahrattas. The Mogul empire was established by Baber, a descendant of Timur, already mentioned, and sultan of the Mogul Tartars. Having lost the northern part of his own dominions by the hostilities of the Usbeck Tartars, he attempted the conquest of Hindostan with such success, that, putting an end to the dynasty of Lodi at Delhi, he established an empire, which was raised to the greatest splendour and authority under Aurungzebe towards the end of the seventeenth century. The Mahrattas were a native Hindoo race, little known till the middle of that century, when, under a chief named Sevagee, they became successful rivals to the Moguls. The conflict between these two great powers was necessarily injurious to the English. Both the belligerents had fleets of galliots on the coast; these repeatedly skirmished in the very harbour of Bombay, and the factory was, in self-defence, occasionally driven into hostilities with each party. Surat suffered even more severely, the Mahrattas ravaging up to its very gates. In Bengal, the English, thinking they had reason to be dissatisfied with the\nconduct of the native powers, resolved to seek redress by arms; but the attempt was unfortunate, and they were obliged to retire from Hooghley and take refuge at Chutanuttee, contiguous to Calcutta. After a succession of hostilities, in which the factories at Patna and Cossimbazar were taken and plundered, an accommodation was effected, and the English were allowed to return to Hooghley. Negotiations for regaining their ancient privileges were commenced, but were interrupted by fresh hostilities. The contest between the Moguls and the Mahrattas had taken a decided turn in favour of the former; and Aurungzebe threatened to drive the English from his dominions. But the revenue derived from the trade was too valuable to be relinquished, and a fresh negotiation for peace terminated favourably. Tegnapatam, on the coast of Coromandel, had been ceded to the English by the rajah of Gingee, while besieged in his capital by Aurungzebe; and on the defeat of the rajah the grant was confirmed by the Mogul chief: the English fortified the station, and it has since been known as Fort St. David.\n\nThe peace was followed by an event which deserves notice, as having laid the foundation of the future capital of British India. This was the transfer of the agency to Chutanuttee, to which place the British had retired when expelled from Hooghley. It was subsequently fortified, and in 1698, a grant was obtained from Prince Azim, one of the grandsons of Aurungzebe, of the three connected villages of Chutanuttee, Govindpore, and Calcutta, with the justiciary power over the inhabitants. These new possessions were forthwith fortified, and received the name of Fort William; and about the same time Bengal was elevated to the rank of a presidency. For some years the position and relative constitution of the British presidencies had fluctuated considerably; but Bombay at last completely superseded Surat: and from the building of Fort William the established presidencies were those of Madras, Bombay, and Bengal.\n\nFrom its commencement the Company had been occasionally exposed to the competition of rivals. In the reign of James I. Sir Edward Mitchelbourne, for whose employment the government had vainly interceded, obtained a license to engage in the eastern trade, which was an evident violation of the charter of\nthe Company; he however made but one voyage, and it appears rather for plunder than for traffic or discovery. By Charles I. Sir William Courten was invested with similar privileges, and formed an association which assumed the name of the Assayda Merchants: with this body, after some years of competition, the Company coalesced. In the reign of William III. another company was formed under a charter from the king, which was termed the English Company, the old one being designated the London Company. The rivalry of these two bodies was soon found to be productive of mischievous consequences to both, and the expediency of a union became apparent. This was ultimately effected, and in 1708 the companies were consolidated by Act of Parliament, under the name of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies. From this period the British interests in India may be considered as steadily advancing. The amount of trade and shipping increased, and the intercourse and influence of the Company were extended.\n\nA period of quiet prosperity affords slender materials for history; and till the breaking out of the war between England and France, in 1745, nothing occurs worthy of notice. The first appearance of the French in India was nearly 150 years before this period, when a company which had been formed in Brittany sent out two ships; but the voyage was attended with so little success, that on their return the company was dissolved. At later periods the French made some further attempts to trade and establish factories: their chief rendezvous was at Surat; but the Dutch and English uniting against them, they were compelled to abandon it. They next attempted to seize on Trincomalee, but in this also they were unsuccessful. They were more fortunate in an attempt upon St. Thom\u00e9, a seaport contiguous to Madras, which they carried by assault. They retained it, however, only two years; but from the wreck of this establishment was formed their celebrated settlement of Pondicherry, where a small district was ceded to them by the native prince. In 1746 Madras was besieged by a French armament, and compelled to capitulate. Admiral Boscawen made an attempt to retaliate upon Pondicherry, which was unsuccessful; but the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle restored Madras to the English.\nINDIA.\n\nFrom this time the history of India rises in interest and importance. We have no longer to detail the advantages of commercial speculation, but to record the transfer of a magnificent empire into the hands of strangers, who, a short time previously, were supplicants for the privilege of defending themselves.\n\nThe territory of the Carnatic was one of the subordinate principalities immediately governed by nabobs, but subject to the soubahdar of the Deccan, who was himself a feudatory under the Mogul emperor. Nizam ul Mulk, soubahdar of the Deccan, dying in 1748, the succession to the vacant province was disputed between his son Nazir and his grandson Murzafa; at the same time the nabob of the Carnatic was opposed by a rival claimant. The pretender to the province and the pretender to the nabobship made common cause, and succeeded in attaching to their interests M. Dupleix, governor of Pondicherry, a man of great talent, and of still greater ambition and capacity for intrigue. The combined forces of these allies were successful in a battle, in which the lawful nabob of the Carnatic was killed, and his eldest son taken prisoner. His second son, Mahomet Ali Khan, having escaped, implored and obtained the aid of the English. Such was the origin of the Carnatic war between the English and the French; and it is remarkable that these two nations should have been engaged in hostile operations against each other in India at a time when no war existed between them in Europe. As soon as intelligence of these extraordinary events reached the courts of the two countries, orders were sent out to put an end to the contest, and a treaty was entered into, by which the two nations were to possess equal dominion, military force, and advantages of commerce on the east coast of the peninsula. The breaking out of the seven years' war in 1756 prevented the execution of this treaty, and the French and English became principals instead of auxiliaries. The French at first met with some partial success; but the tide of fortune turned in favour of their rivals, who acquired, partly by conquest and partly by negotiation, a considerable increase of dominion as well as of influence.\n\nThe English were at the same time obliged to have recourse to arms to defend their interests in another part of India. The\nnabob of Bengal, Surajah Dowlah, attacked, and after a brief resistance, took Calcutta. The event has attained an infamous celebrity by the cruelty which accompanied it. The European inhabitants, 146 in number, were, in the most sultry season of the year, confined for twelve hours within the too-memorable Black Hole, a cube of eighteen feet, having no outlets except two small windows, strongly barred. In this miserable den, all, except twenty-three, perished. The city was in a short time retaken by Colonel Clive, afterwards Lord Clive, who had already exhibited proofs of that talent which raised him to eminence. Peace with the nabob followed; but it was subsequently proved that he was in correspondence with the French. The English resolved to punish his faithlessness, by supporting the pretensions of a rival. This led to the famous battle of Plassy, by which Meer Jaffier obtained the nabobship, and his English allies considerable treasure and accession of territory.\n\nMeer Jaffier, however, became unwilling to fulfil the conditions of his elevation, and he was in consequence deposed. His successor, who was raised by the same influence, was his son-in-law Meer Cossim, and it was stipulated that he should grant to the English, for the pay of their army, the districts of Burdwan, Midnapore, and Chittagong. But he, too, became hostile to the power which had raised him, and it was deemed expedient to restore Meer Jaffier. A war ensued with Cossim, in which the English were completely victorious, and Cossim escaped into the dominions of the vizier of Oude.\n\nThe same year which witnessed the expulsion of Cossim was signalized by the conclusion of a peace between France and England. The former country was reinstated in the factories which she possessed in 1749; but the latter, in addition to her old settlements, retained the circar of Masulipatam and its dependent districts, acquired from the French, as well as the castle of Surat, the jaghire round Madras, the Calcutta zeminary, and the districts of Burdwan, Midnapore, and Chittagong.\n\nThe vizier of Oude, Suja Dowlah, with whom Cossim had taken refuge, encouraged by some discontents which existed in the British army, decided on hostilities, and war commenced. The discipline of the British army having been restored, Suja Dowlah was twice defeated; first by Major Carnac, secondly\nby Major Munro, and was compelled to throw himself upon the generosity of the victors. Such was also the fortune of a more elevated individual, the emperor of Delhi, who had been recently engaged in hostilities with the British, but was now a fugitive and a temporary sojourner with his nominal vassal, the ruler of Oude. Terms were granted to both, and in regard to the vizier, they were certainly not hard ones. The entire territories which the vizier had previously governed were restored to him, with the exception of certain districts reserved to the Mogul emperor, who, in return for the consideration shown for him, conferred upon the British the dewanny of the three provinces of Bengal, Bahar, and Orissa. The word dewanny is derived from dewan, which was the appellation of the officers appointed by the Mogul government for the collection and disbursement of the provincial revenues, and for the administration of civil justice. These officers held their stations during pleasure, and were only stewards for the emperor; but the grant to the Company was in perpetuity, and assigned to them the whole provincial revenue, subject only to the payment of certain specific sums. In addition to this, the emperor granted to the English the maritime districts known by the name of the Northern Circars, though over them his authority was but nominal. They fell within the government of the soubahdar of the Deccan; but having been the seat of hostilities between the English and French, the soubahdar's authority was not well established. By negotiation with him, the Company obtained possession of this disputed territory, with the exception of a small part which became theirs in reversion. This cession, however, involved the British in new wars. It was a condition of their treaty with the soubahdar, that they should assist him with troops when he might stand in need of them; and in 1760 he applied for this assistance against Hyder Ali Khan, the sovereign of Mysore. The required aid was granted; but Hyder Ali, not less skilful as a diplomatist than as a warrior, succeeded in detaching the soubahdar from his English connection, and prevailed upon him not only to conclude a separate peace, but even to enter into an alliance offensive and defensive, for the purpose of extinguishing the British power in the Deccan. Their combined operations were frustrated, and the soubahdar deserting Hyder as he had done\nhis former ally, made peace with the British, and retired to his own dominions. Hyder Ali then prosecuted the war alone, and, entering the Carnatic, committed dreadful ravages. Having diverted the British forces to a distance from Madras, he suddenly appeared before that place with 6,000 cavalry, having accomplished a march of 120 miles in three days. His further progress was arrested by negotiation, and a treaty was concluded on the principle of a mutual restitution of conquests.\n\nOur arms were next directed against the Mahrattas, who had invaded the Rohilla country. The British, acting as the allies of Suja Dowlah, drove them beyond the Ganges. For this service the Rohilla chiefs had agreed to pay Suja Dowlah forty lacs of rupees; but failing in the performance of their contract, the Rohilla country was added to the British conquests. A considerable tract of land was also conquered from the Jauts and other adventurers, by which the boundaries of the province of Oude were considerably advanced. On the death of Suja Dowlah, which took place soon afterwards, the province of Benares was ceded to the Company.\n\nA subsequent war with the Mahrattas was distinguished by some movements of uncommon brilliancy. A body of native troops, commanded by British officers, but whose number did not exceed 7,000, traversed with success almost the entire Mahratta territory. Several fine provinces were subdued, and important fortresses taken; but war breaking out with Hyder Ali, peace was made with the Mahrattas, and all the acquisitions given up, except Salsette, and the small islands situate within the gulf formed by Bombay, Salsette, and the continent. The war with Hyder Ali raged until his death, and was continued by his son Tippoo Sultan; but the conclusion of a peace between the English and French depriving Tippoo of the hope of assistance from the latter power, hostilities were terminated by a treaty, which left the affairs of both the belligerents nearly in the same condition as before the commencement of the war. But Tippoo Sultan's restless character would not suffer him to remain at peace, and his invasion of the possessions of the rajah of Travancore, who was under the protection of the English, involved that power in a fresh quarrel with this turbulent prince. The result to him was humiliating. After two years war, he was compelled by Lord Cornwallis to pur-\nchase peace by the payment of a large sum of money, the sacrifice of half his dominions, and the delivery of two of his sons as hostages for the due performance of the conditions of the treaty.\n\nThe memorable campaign which terminated in the discomfiture of Tippoo Sultan, was succeeded by seven years of tranquillity. The enemies of British interests were not, however, inactive, but were employed in sowing the seeds of future wars. Among the most insidious and dangerous of these enemies may be reckoned the French, ever on the watch for an opportunity of diminishing the power of the English, and now intoxicated with the doctrines of liberty and equality which they had undertaken to disseminate throughout the earth. Even regions which for ages had patiently submitted to despotic power, were not exempt from the intrusion of these opinions. The French ventured to establish a society in Mysore for the diffusion of the knowledge of the rights of man, and met with very different success to that which awaited the unfortunate Jean Bon St. Andr\u00e9 in the kindred region of Africa. They received from the sovereign patronage and protection. He even condescended to become an honorary member of the society, and was enrolled among its associates by the incongruous name of Citizen Tippoo. The result of these machinations was another war, which terminated with the storming of Seringapatam, the death of Tippoo, and the partition of his dominions. In the division, the English retained the districts of Canara, including all the seacoast of the Mysore, the provinces immediately adjoining the possessions of the British on the coast of Malabar, and the Carnatic; the forts and posts of the passes into the Mysore, and the island and fortress of Seringapatam. Certain districts were given to the Nizam, which, however, were afterwards surrendered by that power to the English, together with other territories which had been acquired by a former treaty. A third portion was reserved to be given, upon certain conditions, to the Peishwa, the actual, though not the nominal, head of the Mahrattas; but he having refused to accede, the reserved territory was divided between the British and the Nizam. The Peishwa, however, was forced ultimately to claim the assistance of the British to deliver him from the state of anarchy by which he was surrounded. A treaty was in con-\nINDIA.\n\nsequence concluded, by which the British consented to furnish\nthe Peishwa with a certain number of troops, and he to assign\na portion of territory for their payment.\n\nThe war which ensued for the protection of the Peishwa was\ndistinguished by the brilliant services of Lord Lake, and of\nanother commander, who in the East commenced that illustrious\ncareer which he terminated by the liberation of Europe. The\nsplendour of his Indian campaigns is indeed obscured by the\nsurpassing glory that encircles the head of the conqueror of\nNapoleon; but no one who adverts to this period of the history\nof India, however briefly, can be excused if he pass by the\nname of Wellington without bestowing the tribute of admira-\ntion. Space will not permit a detailed recital of the achieve-\nments of the British army in these wars: it must suffice to\nrecord the results. In a comparatively short space of time, a\nformidable confederation of French and Mahratta power was\nbroken, and an immense accession of territory gained.\n\nFrom this period the history of India presents little of\nimportance until 1814, when the British became involved in a\nwar with the Nepalese, a people of aggressive habits, occupying\na mountain country. The nature of the country, the imperfect\nknowledge which the British possessed of it, the courage of the\nenemy, and the fortifications by which they were defended,\nwere obstacles to the success of the British, and continued for\nsome time to impede it. Military skill ultimately overcame\nthese difficulties, and the Nepalese being subdued, agreed to\na treaty, by which the British became possessed of certain dis-\ntricts deemed necessary to the security of their frontier; but\nendeavouring, in the true spirit of Indian policy, to evade\nratification of the treaty, a renewal of hostilities became un-\navoidable. A war of very brief duration was sufficient to\naccomplish its object.\n\nThe constant wars and commotions prevailing among the\nnative powers of India produced in great numbers men trained\nin habits of rapine and disorder. Gathering strength by\ndegrees, these lawless ruffians became at length associated in\nbands under recognised leaders, and on the arrival of the\nmarquis of Hastings in India, they mustered a force of not\nless than 40,000 cavalry. They were termed Pindarries, and\nin their predatory excursions committed the most shocking\nexcesses. The irruptions of these bandits into the Company's territories compelled the government to take up arms, and they were preparing to take vigorous measures for their expulsion, when the Peishwa, an ally and dependant of the British, revolted against their authority. The rajah of Nagpore, who stood in the same relation to the British, pursued a similar course. Both these powers were subdued, while the war with the Pindarries was prosecuted with vigour. In the mean time the British government became involved in disputes with Scindia and Holkar, two independent chiefs. With the former they made terms; but the treaty forced upon him was executed with extreme reluctance. Holkar resolved to have recourse to war. It ended in his entire defeat; his power was completely broken, and he was compelled to sue for peace. The army being now at liberty to act against the Pindarries, the dispersion of that lawless body was at length effected.\n\nNot many years elapsed between this and the war with the Burmese. That war, like most of those in which the English have been engaged, was occasioned by the aggression of the power with whom it was waged. During the Pindarrie war, the Burmese were in communication with several of the belligerent native chiefs, and were even prepared for an invasion of the frontier of Bengal. This was averted by a stratagem. The marquis of Hastings had received a rescript from the Burmese monarch, requiring the surrender of all provinces east of the Baugruty. The projected hostility was evidently a measure concerted with the Mahrattas. Lord Hastings sent back the envoy with an intimation that the answer should be conveyed through another channel. It declared that the Governor-General was too well acquainted with his majesty's wisdom to be the dupe of the gross forgery attempted to be palmed upon him, and he therefore transmitted to the king the document fabricated in his august name, and trusted that he would submit to condign punishment the persons who had endeavoured to sow dissension between two powers, whose reciprocal interest it was to cultivate relations of amity. By this proceeding the necessity of noticing the insolent step of the Burmese monarch was evaded, and that sovereign, on hearing of the defeat of his Mahratta allies, was content to remain at peace. But though the expression of hostile feeling\nwas for a while suppressed, the feeling itself was not removed, and the Burmese monarch now gained courage to attack, where before he had been satisfied to threaten. War commenced, and the successes of the British led to the conclusion of an armistice, which was employed in negotiations. These negotiations being unsuccessful, hostilities were resumed. The march of the English, as in Nepaul, was in some degree retarded by the nature of the country; but this obstacle being overcome, the Burmese were completely defeated, and the British advanced towards the capital, when negotiations were recommenced, and a treaty concluded, by which the Burmese secured their existence as a nation, and the English obtained an extension of territory, valuable as affording a secure frontier.\n\nDuring the progress of the Burmese war, the British obtained from the king of the Netherlands, Malacca, Singapore, and the Dutch possessions which remained to that nation on the continent of India, in exchange for the settlement of Bencoolen and other possessions in Sumatra; an event deserving notice, and rendered important from the position subsequently attained by Singapore as a vast entrep\u00f4t of commerce.\n\nSome years later, the misconduct of the rajah of Coorg, a small principality in Southern India, rendered necessary his deposition from sovereignty, and his removal from the country which he had misgoverned; and there being no one entitled to succeed him, Coorg was unavoidably annexed to the British dominions, of which it has since formed part.\n\nThe Affghan war commenced in 1839,* with a view to raising a barrier against the aggressive power of Russia, brought to the British no accession of territory, of power, or, taken on the whole, of glory. It was ostensibly undertaken to restore to the throne a former Affghan ruler, Shah Shoojah, supposed at least to be actuated by friendly feelings towards the British, though doubts on that point may well be entertained. The advance of the forces destined for the conquest of Affghanistan was attended by much difficulty and dreadful suffering; but at length a part of the invading army reached the chief city, Cabool. Here it was thought the object of the expedition was gained; but the commencement of a new and frightful series\n\n* Shah Shoojah was enthroned at Candahar on the 8th May, 1839.\nof calamities was at hand. Insurrection broke out, the British envoy was treacherously murdered, a large part of the British force was destroyed, and the remainder compelled to retire under the most disastrous circumstances, incessant annoyance and fearful slaughter marking its progress. Many deeds of heroism, never surpassed, tended indeed to add fresh lustre to the British name; and, among others, the noble defence of Jelalabad by Sir Robert Sale, can never be forgotten so long as Afghanistan is remembered. But the war and its consequences contribute to furnish an awful page in the history of British enterprise in India. Ultimately the country was avenged, and its reputation vindicated, through the vigorous counsels and vigorous acts of Generals Pollock and Nott. The former arrived first at Cabool, and replanted the British colours there: the latter arrived shortly afterwards. The British could now withdraw without discredit, from a country where, for the first time, the prestige of their national character seemed endangered. That at least was vindicated and upheld; though, looking at the expenditure of blood and treasure, at the mass of suffering, and the imminent danger of irreparable disgrace which must have followed a premature retirement, every Englishman must wish that the war had never been undertaken.\n\nThe chapter in the history of British India which records the annexation of Sinde, is little more consolatory to a sound-hearted Englishman than that on the war in Afghanistan. The ameers or rulers of Sinde were ever opposed to any close connection with foreigners. Various attempts had at different times been made to establish such connection, but they had been met reluctantly and unfavourably. Two or three treaties had been entered into; but they were brief, dry, and to neither party satisfactory. The ameers of Sinde hated the alliance, which the British were anxious to establish, at first, for commercial, latterly, for political purposes. When the British commenced the march to Afghanistan, a treaty was forced upon the rulers of Sinde, which was more distasteful than any former one. Under this treaty, a British military force was to be permanently stationed in Sinde; and, after some considerable time, Sir Charles Napier, whose career in Sinde has given rise to such a mass of controversy, was appointed to the chief\ncommand there. He commenced his course certainly with vigour, but as certainly with little consideration of the existing rulers. Treaties were proposed, which, though rejection must have been looked for, were accepted, whether with sincerity or not;\u2014probably there was little of that quality on either side. But, notwithstanding the acceptance of the treaties, Sir Charles Napier continued to advance. During his progress, the British Residency was attacked. It was gallantly defended, but weakness of numbers and deficiency of ammunition soon rendered retreat necessary. This was effected in good order, but at the sacrifice of the greater part of the property within the Residence. The battle of Meeanee followed, in which the British gained a brilliant victory. Another battle, fought near Hydrabad, the capital, may be said to have terminated the contest; and Sinde, in 1843, became a British possession.\n\nThe conclusion of the contest in Sinde found the British government involved in difficulties in Gwalior, or the dominions of Scindia. The death of the representative of that house without heirs rendered an arrangement for the appointment of a successor necessary. A child, said to be the nearest relative of the deceased prince, was selected, and the British government approved. But every Indian court is a focus of intrigue, and that of Gwalior formed no exception. A rabble army of 30,000 men was a source of weakness, not of strength; and through the influence of a profligate and reckless court, combined by that of a disorganized army, the state appeared rapidly tending to dissolution. Internal war had in fact commenced, when the British government, somewhat tardily, though at the last rather hastily, put in motion a military force towards the disturbed country. It soon came into hostile collision with the enemy; and two victories in one day, gained by two separate portions of the British force, decided the questions at issue. A new treaty followed, dated January, 1844, in which a variety of arrangements for the safety of Scindia's territories and the security of those adjacent were embodied.\n\nBy this time, a new cause for apprehension had arisen in the north-western part of India. The death of Runjeet Singh, the \"Lion of the Punjab,\" had been followed by a series of excesses, terminating in a state of things in which the army was tri-\numphant over the government, and was an object of its dread rather than of its dependence. At length a portion of it crossed the Sutlej, and invaded the British territories. This of course was repelled; and, first at Moodkee, subsequently at Ferozeshah, in December, 1845, the Sikhs were defeated. At Aliwal, and at Sobraon, fresh triumphs attended the British forces, who finally crossed the river, and dictated the terms of submission at Lahore, the Sikh capital. Here a treaty was concluded, under which the British obtained a cession of all the territory between the Beas and the Sutlej; the native government of Lahore being retained, with some requisite modifications. But this arrangement proved of short duration. The atrocious conduct of a chief, holding the fortress of Mooltan, where two British officers were murdered, the generally distracted state of the country, the open violation by the government and people of the treaty so recently concluded, and the actual levying of war against their peaceful neighbour, demanded further intervention of a hostile character. One step only remained to be taken, and the success which again attended the British enabled the Governor-General to take it. The Punjab was annexed, and was thenceforward a part of the vast empire of India. In this instance, as in so many others which occur in the history of that empire, the cause of Great Britain was the cause of general humanity.\n\nAnother Burmese war followed; rendered necessary by the wrongs, public and private, inflicted by the Burmese government. It was neither long in duration nor brilliant in events; and concluded with the annexation, in December, 1852, of the extensive province of Pegu, in satisfaction to some degree of the injuries sustained, and in aid of the means of defending British territory and property from further aggression.\n\nAfter all the declamation that has been expended upon the means by which the British dominions have been acquired, probably no conquests were ever made more righteously. This is certainly true with regard to the greater portion of them. Strangers were forced to become conquerors in self-defence. During a considerable part of the last century, the question was, whether India should be subjugated by France or by England. To this question but one answer could be given. The perfidy of the native princes was another source of war,\nIND.\n\nand of British aggrandizement. But the crimes of these rulers have in this respect been beneficial to their subjects, by transferring them to the care of a better and a milder government. No friend to mankind can wish that the natives had remained under their old masters, and none but the most prejudiced can believe that their lot would have been improved by transferring them to the French.\n\nINDMEYEE.\u2014See Edmy.\n\nINDOOR.\u2014A town in the native state of Hyderabad, or the dominions of the Nizam, 94 miles N. by W. from Hyderabad, and 162 miles E.N.E. from Sholapoor.

These consist of several isolated tracts, some of them lying very remote from others. They may be thus enumerated:\u20141. Territory annexed to the town of Indore. This portion, within which is situated the British cantonment of Mhow, is bounded on the north by Gwalior; on the east by Dewas and a portion of Scindia's dominions; on the south and south-west by the British districts of Saugor and Nerbudda; and on the west by Burwanee and Dhar. It lies between lat. 21\u00b0 18'\u201423\u00b0 5', long. 75\u00b0 2'\u201476\u00b0 16'. Its length from north to south is 120 miles, its breadth 82 miles. 2. The tract of territory annexed to the town of Rampoora, situate north of Indore, and lying between lat. 24\u00b0 3'\u201424\u00b0 46', long. 75\u00b0 6'\u201476\u00b0 12'. This section is seventy-one miles in length from east to west, and forty in breadth: its principal towns are Rampoora, Bhaupoora, and Chendwassa. A third division, also situate north of Indore, includes the town of Mehedpore, in lat. 23\u00b0 29', long. 75\u00b0 42'. A fourth section, situate to the westward of Indore, contains the town of Dhie, in lat. 22\u00b0 10', long. 74\u00b0 39'. Pitlaud, in lat. 23\u00b0 1', long. 74\u00b0 51', is the principal place of the fifth portion, lying north-west of Indore. The last outlying tract of Holcar's dominions, of which Airwas, in lat. 22\u00b0 31', long. 76\u00b0 26', is the chief town, lies to\nthe eastward of Indore. The area of the whole of Holcar's dominions is estimated at 8,318 square miles.* Of these districts, those situate to the north are drained by the river Chumbul and its feeders; those to the south, by the Nerbudda, flowing east and west. Like the rest of Malwa, these districts are fertile, producing in abundance and excellence, wheat and other grain, pulse, sugar-cane, cotton, and especially opium, the poppy producing it being so generally cultivated, that, when in bloom, it gives the country the appearance of a vast garden. Tobacco is also much cultivated, and is of excellent quality.\n\nThe great Vindhya range traverses the southern or Indore division of Holcar's dominions, in a direction nearly from east to west, a small portion of the territory lying to the north of the mountains, but by much the larger part to the south of them. The part lying south is a portion of the valley of the Nerbudda, bounded on the south by the Satpura Mountains. The summits of the Vindhya vary in height, probably from 1,500 to 2,000 feet; and at one place the crest of the Jam Ghat, lat. 22\u00b0 23', long. 75\u00b0 49', rises to the elevation of 2,328 feet above the sea. The elevation of the Satpura range is somewhat greater, one summit being 2,500 feet above the level of the sea. Basalt and other volcanic formations predominate in both ranges, though there is also much sandstone. The Nerbudda river traverses this territory from east to west, dividing it into two nearly equal portions. The length of its course through the district would be about seventy miles, were it uninterrupted; but this is not the case, the territory under notice being indented for some distance by the projection into it of the state of Dhar and the district of Mundlaisir, which the river crosses, and then re-enters the dominions of Holcar. Of the extent to which this part of the river admits of navigation, reports are not perfectly agreed. On a comparison of the different statements, it would appear to be practicable by small boats for limited distances during a considerable part of the year. The channel of the Nerbudda is very deeply worn in basaltic rock; the banks are very high, and in the periodical rains the stream rushes down with great rapidity, and with a\n\n* Sutherland states the area to be 4,245 square miles; but this estimate is obviously limited to the Indore division of Holcar's territory.\n\n\u2020 Map accompanying Sketches.\nvast volume of water. The elevation above the sea, of the surface of the country in the bottom of the valley at Mundlaisir, in the central part of the district, is between 600' and 700 feet. \"The general appearance of the country is that of an undulated valley, intersected in various directions by low rocky ranges, mostly covered with jungle, in some parts thickly, of a stunted growth, consisting of the dhak, babool, and other shrubs, which also cover considerable tracts in the plains.\"\n\nFrom its intertropical position, the climate is sultry, the thermometer ranging from 60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 in the house. For some months, from the close of the periodical rains, the malaria is so deadly in the jungly tracts, that no European ventures into them. The most remarkable wild animals are tigers, leopards, bears, hyenas, lynxes, jackals, foxes, monkeys, nylgaus (Antelope picta), and wild kine of great size and strength. There are also alligators, the boa constrictor, and some other formidable snakes. The Nerbudda abounds in fine fish.\n\nBesides the ruling tribe of Mahrattas, the population comprises many other classes of Hindoos, a few Mahomedans, and a considerable number of Gonds and Bheels. It is peculiarly the country of the Bheels, who are considered to have been the earliest occupiers of the soil. This race is one of the most wild and savage found in India, its people living for the most part on wild vegetables and game, the latter the produce of their bows and arrows, or on the plunder of their more civilized neighbours. They are, however, not entirely irclaimable, but have in some instances been converted into useful and trustworthy soldiers. The population of the whole of Holcar's dominions is estimated at 815,164, which yields an average of 98 to the square mile. The revenue in 1848 was estimated at 22,17,210 rupees, or 221,721l. The armed force, including the contingent of cavalry, amounted to about 7,000 men. The principal towns,\u2014Indore, Mundlaisir, Rampoora, Bhanpoora, and others, are described under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe most important routes are\u20141. The Bombay and Agra road. 2. From north to south, from Oojein, through Indore and Mhow, by the Jam Ghat, to Mundlaisir, where it turns south-west, proceeding to Bombay. 3. From east to west,\nfrom Goona to Neemuch, Bhanpoora, and Rampoora. 4. From south-east to north-west, from Mahidpore to Neemuch. The southern and larger portion of the territory has scarcely any route continuously practicable for wheel-carriages, that by the Jam Ghat being represented as the only one throughout the Vindhya range.\n\nThe founder of the family of Holcar was Mulhar Rao, a ryot or cultivator of Hul, a village of the Deccan. His birth is said to have taken place in the year 1693. First a shepherd, and subsequently a soldier, he obtained distinction and promotion in hostilities against Nizam ool Mulk, and being received into the service of the Peishwa, was appointed to the command of 500 horse. In 1728, he received a jaghire of twelve districts north of the Nerbudda; in 1731, he obtained seventy more, being at the same time appointed to the general management of the Mahratta interests in Malwa; and in 1733, Indore was granted to him, with the district appertaining to it. From that time until his death in 1767, he was the most distinguished of the military commanders of the Mahratta race. In addition to the possessions above referred to, he was appointed deshmook or feudatory of Chandore, in Khandeish; while his revenues were further increased by the levy of fixed tributes on several states. He was among the Mahratta leaders at the battle of Paniput in 1761, but fled when it became apparent that the defeat of the Mahrattas was inevitable. Mulhar Rao Holcar had only one son, Koondi Rao, who was killed during his father's lifetime. On the death of Mulhar Rao, the succession devolved on Malli Rao, the son of Koondi Rao. Malli Rao died insane after a few months, and the sovereignty of Indore fell into the hands of his mother Alia Baee, who committed the charge of the military force of her dominions to Tookajee Holcar, a member of the same tribe, but not otherwise related to the family with which the Baee was allied. He appears to have acted strictly in conformity with her wishes during his long command, which was terminated by his death in 1797. This harmony of action and the abilities of both parties brought Indore to a state of high prosperity. Succession to the power of Tookajee was disputed by his two legitimate sons Kasi Rao and Mulhar Rao, the latter of whom was cut off by assassination, through the treachery of his brother, a person\nINDORE.\n\nweak in intellect, deformed in body, and, as his actions showed, not less deformed in his moral constitution. Tookajee left also two illegitimate sons, Etojee and Jeswunt Rao. Etojee attempted to maintain himself by a course of freebooting, but being seized, was put to a very cruel death by the Peishwa, who looked on unmoved, whilst the wretched man, tied to the leg of an elephant, implored mercy, or shrieked in agony as he was dragged along until torn in pieces. Jeswunt Rao, who, on the murder of his brother Mulhar Rao, had fled to Nagpore, and besought the rajah's protection, received it in the shape of imprisonment; from which, however, he contrived to escape. He thereupon, like his brother Etojee, commenced a predatory career, and soon assembled an army of about 30,000 men, with above 100 pieces of artillery. But this large force received a signal defeat from the army of Scindia, when Jeswunt Rao Holcar lost nearly all his artillery, and the disaster was followed by the plunder of the capital. He rapidly recovered from the effects of this mischance, and employed European officers to introduce their discipline into his army. In October, 1802, at the battle of Poona, which he gained over the combined forces of Dowlut Rao Scindia and the Peishwa, he had fourteen regular battalions, 5,000 irregular infantry, and 25,000 horse. The distinguished state of Indore at the commencement of the present century, when the British government was engaged in arduous conflict with various enemies, gave opportunity for Jeswunt Rao Holcar to indulge in devastation and plunder to an enormous extent. General Lake despatched against him five battalions of sepoys and 3,000 irregular horse, under Colonel Monson, an officer of extraordinary bravery, but unfortunately destitute of a corresponding degree of judgment. The expedition accordingly terminated disastrously, and the unhappy retreat of this force is characterized as one of the most lamentable events in the history of the British career in India. The apparent success of Holcar caused great numbers of freebooters to join him, and at the end of August, 1804, he advanced at the head of 60,000 horse to the Jumna, and took the city of Muttra. Marching thence, he commenced the siege of Delhi on the 8th of October, but retreated baffled on the 14th; the British under General Lake marching to its relief. Holcar then, at the\nhead of his cavalry, suddenly crossed the Jumna near Paniput, and laid waste the Doab with fire and sword, closely pursued by General Lake, who, on the morning of November 17th, surprised him in his bivouac at Furruckabad, where he was totally routed, leaving about 3,000 dead; and so rapidly did his predatory followers fall off, that it is stated, that of the 60,000\u00b9 cavalry which he led across the Jumna, less than half that number recrossed it. His infantry, which had been intrenched under the walls of Deeg, had previously been attacked and defeated by a British force under General Frazer, on whose fall, before the fate of the day was determined, the command devolved upon Colonel Monson, who had then the satisfaction of frustrating in some degree the disastrous consequences of his retreat. According to an authority\u00b2 whose means of information were great, Holcar entered Hindostan (or Northern India) with \u201c92,000 men, of whom 66,000 were cavalry, 7,000 artillery, and 19,000 infantry, and 190 pieces of ordnance; and he left it with his whole force diminished to 35,000 horse, 7,000 infantry and artillery, and thirty-five guns.\u201d In October, 1805, Holcar, encouraged no doubt by the wavering and imbecile policy of Lord Cornwallis, and subsequently of Sir George Barlow, successively Governors-General, marched from Ajmeer, where he had remained during the rains, and with 12,000\u00b3 cavalry, 2,500 infantry, and thirty guns,\u2074 advanced to the Punjab, pursued by the British under Lord Lake, who came up with him at the city of Amritsar, where, in December, 1805, a treaty\u2075 was concluded, by which Holcar relinquished any claim on Tonk, Rampoora, Bhoondee, and all places north of the Bhoondee Hills, and in possession of the British government; but was confirmed in nearly all his other possessions. In the following year he murdered Kasi Rao, the legitimate son of Tookajee Holcar, and Kundi Rao, the infant son\u2076 of Mulhar Rao, another legitimate son of Tookajee, assassinated at an earlier period, while contending with his brother Kasi Rao. These atrocities were closely followed by the insanity of the perpetrator, who ultimately sank into a state of utter fatuity, in which he died\u2077 in the year 1811. A stormy regency succeeded, ostensibly administered by Toolsee Bye, mistress of the deceased Jeswunt Rao, but\n\n\u00b9 According to Thorn,\u00b9 sixty.\n\n\u00b2 Malcolm, i. 238.\n\n\u00b3 Duff, Hist. of Mahrattas, iii. 306.\n\n\u2074 Treaties with Native Powers, 617.\n\n\u2075 Malcolm, i. 243, 244.\n\n\u2076 Id. 238.\n\n\u2077 Mem. of War in India, 479.\nactually, at many periods of its continuance, by her various paramours. Before the death of Jeswunt Rao Holcar, she had adopted an infant, Mulhar Rao Holcar, an illegitimate son of her protector, and by general consent he was recognised\\(^7\\) as his father's successor. In 1817, the intrigues and disturbances fomented by the different factions which disturbed the state, came to a crisis. The army seized Toolsee Bye and the young Mulhar Rao, and having murdered the former, commenced hostilities under the ostensible command of the latter; a result long before indicated. These were, however, brought to a speedy termination by the decisive victory which, on December 21st, 1817, was gained\\(^8\\) at Mahidpore, by the British army over that of Holcar. On January 18th, 1818, a treaty\\(^9\\) was concluded at Mundesore, with the British government, that power engaging to extend the same protection to the territory of Holcar as to its own, and to maintain a field-force for the preservation of internal tranquillity, and for defence against foreign aggression; disclaiming all concern with Holcar's relatives or subjects, and entering into a stipulation not to permit the Peishwa or any of his heirs or descendants to claim or exercise any sovereign rights over the dominions of Holcar, and to restore to the latter chief the possessions lately conquered from him. On the other part, Holcar engaged to renounce all claims to the possessions guaranteed to Ameer Khan by the British government; to cede certain pergunnahs to Zalim Singh, of Kota; to confirm to Ghuffloor Khan his jaiaad or grant of various districts in Malwa; to renounce all claim to any places north of the Bhoondee Hills; to cede to the British government all claims of revenues and tributes from the Rajpoot states, and all the Mahratta chieftain's territories within and south of the Satpura range, including the fort of Sindwa, as well as all his possessions in the province of Khandeish, and others intermixed with the territories of the Nizam and the Peishwa; to abstain from diplomatic intercourse with other states, except with the knowledge and consent of the British resident; to entertain in his service no Europeans or Americans without similar permission; to permit an accredited minister from the British government to reside with the maharajah; to discharge his superfluous troops, and not to keep a larger force than 3,000 horse, for whose regular payment a\nsuitable arrangement was to be made. Of the effect of this arrangement, Malcolm observes,\u00b9 \"This was in fact a new condition to the Holcar state; for twenty years had elapsed since it had enjoyed any regular resources or government, and its name during the greater part of that period had only served as a pretext to plunderers for committing every species of excess and crime.\"\n\nMulhar Rao Holcar\u00b2 died in 1833. His mother, known by the title of the Mahjee, thereupon assumed the reins of government; and an adoption took place by Mulhar Rao's widow, of an infant son of Bapoo Holcar, a distant relative of the family. The pregnancy of one of the females in the deceased maharajah's zenana (who subsequently gave birth to a son) having been concealed, the succession of the adopted son, under the title of Martund Rao Holcar, was recognised by the British government, and the birth of the posthumous child was not allowed to disturb the arrangement. Subsequently, public feeling appeared to be decidedly in favour of the superior claims of Hurree Rao Holcar, a former competitor for the guddee, and the nearest male relative of the late maharajah, by whom he had been kept for many years a prisoner in the fort of Maheyseer. An insurrection broke out in favour of the prisoner; the troops sent against him espoused his cause, and the existing government found it necessary to submit. Neutrality was observed by the British government during the contest, and amicable relations were maintained with the new ruler. Hurree Rao Holcar\u00b3 appears to have manifested the full amount of incapacity for government which is ordinarily exhibited by Indian princes. Under his sway the state of the country was so wretched\u2074 that it was rapidly deserted by the inhabitants, especially the more respectable and wealthy portion of them. On the death of this imbecile specimen of oriental chieftainship, he was succeeded\u2075 by a youth named Kumdee Rao Holcar, whom he had adopted with the sanction of the British government. The career of this adopted successor was, however, terminated by an early death,\u2076 when it appears no person possessed any hereditary claim to the guddee, neither had any one valid title to adopt, and the continuance of the Holcar possessions under a separate form of government became a question for consideration. It being\n\n\u00b9 Pol. Disp. to India, 16 June, 1835.\n\u00b2 Treaties, ut supra, 624.\n\u00b3 Pol.

The opportunity was taken to limit the succession to lineal heirs, to the exclusion of adoption. The new chief being a minor, the government was carried on, during his legal infancy, under the superintendence of the resident, by a council of regency, composed of the Mae Sahiba (widow of Jeswunt Rao Holcar) and three principal officers of state. Under this arrangement the administration and state of the country greatly improved. The young chief, educated under the auspices of the British government, displayed at an early age great capacity for public business, and drew forth, by his exemplary conduct, the approbation of the Governor-General. In February, 1852, upon the attainment of his majority, the young rajah assumed the reins of government.\n\nINDORE, the capital of the possessions of Holcar's family, a town situate in a plain of no great extent on the left bank of the small river Kutki. It is an ill-built place, the houses, which are disposed in irregular winding streets, being constructed with sundried bricks, and covered with clumsy tiles laid on bamboos. It contains a few mosques, of no architectural pretensions, and numerous Brahminical temples, built of basalt, and whitewashed with lime. Jacquemont, who visited the place in 1832, describes the palace of Holcar as having no claims to notice, but mentions that he was building another, which would be much superior. The house of the British resident is situate east of the town; and as this, as well as the dwellings of his assistants, are well built, surrounded with groves and gardens, and judiciously disposed in a fine park-like expanse, the whole forms a pleasing scene. A strong escort of cavalry and infantry attend the resident, but the principal British force for this part of India is cantoned at Mhow, thirteen miles more to the south-east.\n\nThe resident at Indore, in addition to his duties connected with that state, is the immediate representative of the British government in regard to various petty states under its pro-\ntection, but in other respects differing greatly in their circumstances. The Bhopal subordinate agency is also subject to his control.\n\nJennah, or old Indore, is situate on the right side of the stream. The present Indore, on the left bank, was built by order of Alia Bacee, widow of Mulhar Rao Holcar, immediately after his death, in 1767. The outline of the city is nearly square, each side being about 1,000 yards in length; the area is about 216 acres, or a third of a square mile, and its population may be conjectured not to exceed 15,000. Its elevation, according to Malcolm and Dangerfield, is 1,998 feet above the sea; but Jacquemont, who, however, did not make any barometrical observations on the subject, is of opinion that this estimate errs in excess.\n\nIndore was plundered in 1801 by the army of Doulut Rao Scindia, which had previously defeated Holcar, at the head of above 30,000 men. In 1804, it was occupied without resistance, by a British force under Colonel Murray; but was restored on the subsequent pacification, in 1805.

Among the various tribes and people through whose territories it flows, it bears different names; but that by which it is most generally known and most highly celebrated, is Indus, derived from the Sanscrit Sindhu, which word, changed by the Greeks into Sinthus, and by the Latins into Sindus, ultimately passed into the name now in ordinary use. Though the vigilant jealousy of the Chinese, who rule Tibet, has excluded Europeans from that country, the inquiries of Moorcroft, Trebeck, and Gerard, have established, beyond any reasonable ground of doubt, that the source of the longest and principal stream of the Indus is at the north of the Kailas Mountain, regarded in Hindoo mythology as the mansion of the gods, and Siva's paradise; and though over-estimated by Gerard in respect to its altitude, still having an elevation of 22,000 feet above the level of the sea. The locality of the source of the Indus may be stated with some probability to be in lat. 32\u00b0, long. 81\u00b0 30'. Near its source, it bears the name of Sinh-kha-bab, or \"lion's mouth,\" from a superstitious belief that it flows from one. It first takes a north-westerly direction to Tagle, about 160 miles from the place of its reputed source. It is there joined on its left, or south-western side, by the Eekung Choo, or \"river of Gartope,\" which rises on the western base of the Kailas.\n\n* Sind or Sindhu, \"the sea.\"\u2014Shakespear in v.\n\u2020 Pliny observes, \"Indus incolis Sindus appellatus.\"\n\u2021 Ritter (Erdkunde von Asien, i. 13) derives the name Kailas, or Kailasa, from kil, \"to be cold.\" Ideeler, in the index to that work, translates it hoch Gipfel, \"high summit.\" Hodgson states \"that Cylas is a general appellation for high ranges always covered with snow.\" (As. Res. xiv. 92.) Humboldt states that kylas signifies \"cold mountain\" (montagne froid), and Kailassa any \"very elevated summit.\" (Asie Centrale, i. 112.)\nMountain. Moorcroft found the \"river of Gartope,\" at about forty miles from its supposed source, \"a clear, broad, and rapid, but not deep, river.\" The country through which these streams flow, varies in elevation from 15,000 to 18,000 feet. It is one of the most dreary regions in existence, the surface being for the most part formed by the disintegration of the granite of the adjacent mountains. It is swept over by the most furious winds, generally blowing from the north. These are at once piercingly cold and parchingly dry, and no vegetation is visible but a few stunted shrubs and some scanty and frost-withered herbage. It is, however, the proper soil for the production of shawl-wool, which is obtained from the yak, the goat, the sheep, certain animals of the deer kind, and even, it is said, from the horse and the dog.\n\nThe united stream bears the name of the northern confluent, Sinh-kha-bab; and, near the La Ganskiel Pass, about fifty miles below the junction, the river leaves the table-land through which it had previously flowed, and enters the deep gorges of the great depression dividing the Kouenlun or Mooz Taugh from the Himalaya. To this point, five miles from the Chinese frontier, having an elevation of 14,000 or 15,000 feet, its course has been explored by Trebeck, the companion of Moorcroft. It is situate in lat. 32\u00b0 56', long. 79\u00b0 22', on the border of a sandy plain, or rather wide valley, studded with small lakes, having their edges incrusted with soda. The river was here found to be about sixty yards wide, apparently deep, and in the middle of November frozen over in most parts. It is, however, fordable occasionally in this neighbourhood, becoming in summer shallower during the progress of night, and deeper as the day advances, in consequence of the melting of the snows on the adjacent summits, through the sun's heat. Thirty miles below this, the river turns nearly south-west for a short distance.\n\n* Gerard, just quoted, observes (245), \"The silky softness of the goat's fleece, and even its existence, depends on the arid air and vegetation,\" as the coldest tracts of the Himalaya, where not characterized by dryness, fail to support this state of animal life in perfection. This view of the subject is supported by the observations of Conolly on the Angora goat. (Journal of Roy. As. Soc. 1840, vol. vi. p. 159.)\n\n\u2020 This appears to be the farthest point to which the Sinh-kha-bab has been ascended by any European, though, as has been seen, its feeder, the \"river of Gartope,\" was crossed and surveyed by Moorcroft much higher.\ndistance, and then takes the direction of north-west. At Ugshi, which is about 330 miles from the source, it was surveyed by Moorcroft, and found to be about fifty yards wide. Close to Le, the capital of Ladakh, and thirty miles below Ugshi, the elevation of its bed is not less than 10,000 feet; and if that of its source be assumed at 18,000, and its length, so far, at 360 miles, its fall will be found to be twenty-two feet per mile. Yet the descent of the bed of the Sinh-kha-bab is far less rapid than that of the Sutluj, which in thirty miles descends 2,300 feet, or about seventy-six feet in the mile. Holding its course in a direction approaching to north-west, the Sinh-kha-bab, about eighteen miles below Le, is joined, opposite to Niemo, by the river of Zanskar, flowing from the district of the same name, and in a direction from south-west to north-east. The Zanskar is a very rapid, turbid river; the Sinh-kha-bab, a clear and placid stream. About thirty miles below this, and 408 from its source, Vigne found the river, at Kulutzi, crossed by a wooden bridge, and only twenty-five yards wide. The small size of the river, after a course of more than 400 miles, can only be accounted for by the excessive aridity of the elevated tract through which it has held its way. Moorcroft estimates the breadth of the river at this place at only twenty yards; but he found that it rose nearly forty feet during the season of inundation. Having flowed about fifty-five miles below this place, in a north-west direction, it receives from the south the river of Draz, which, rising in the mountains forming the north-eastern frontier of Kashmir, holds a north-easterly course of about ninety miles, and, receiving several streams both from the east and west, discharges a considerable volume of water at its confluence. From this confluence the Sinh-kha-bab takes a more northerly direction, for about forty-seven miles, to the fort of Karis, in lat. 35\u00b0 11', long. 75\u00b0 57', where it receives, from the north, the water of the Shy-yok, by far its most important tributary above the\n\n* Vigne (Kashmir, ii. 341) states the elevation of Le at about 10,000 feet; according to which, the bed of the Indus there must be below that height. Moorcroft states the elevation of Le to be above 11,000 feet, and that of the confluence of the Zanskar river and Sinh-kha-bab, about twenty miles farther down the stream, and consequently less elevated, at nearly 12,000 feet.\nriver of Kabool. The Shy-yok, though not explored to its source by any European, is considered, from the concurring testimony of the natives, to have its origin at the southern end of an extensive glacier, or frozen lake, embosomed in a gorge on the southern side of the Karakorum or Mooz Taugh Mountains, and in lat. $35^\\circ 33'$, long. $77^\\circ 40'$. It holds a generally south-easterly course for about forty miles, and then turns, first to the north-west, and afterwards to the west, for about 185 miles farther, to its junction with the Sinh-kha-bab. The accumulation of ice in the great glacier from which this river proceeds, its subsequent dislodgement, and the obstruction thereby caused in the channel of the Shy-yok, have from time to time caused the water to make violent irruptions through its ordinary barriers, leading to dreadful inundations. The great and sudden flood of the Indus, which, in the summer of 1841, was felt as far as Attock, and even beyond it, has been generally attributed to such a cause.\\footnote{Journ. As. Soc. 1841, p. 616 \u2014 Falconer, Cataclysm of the Indus.}\n\nAt the confluence of the two rivers, the Shy-yok is about 150 yards broad, the Sinh-kha-bab not more than eighty; but the latter is the deeper, and has a greater body of water. Below the confluence, the river is known by the name Aba Sind\\footnote{Vigne, Kashmir, ii. 302.} (Indus Proper). About twenty-five miles below the point of junction, and westward of it, the Indus, opposite Iskardoh, receives from the north the river of Shyghur. The downward course of the Indus between Iskardoh and Makpon-i-Shagaron, in which interval it runs a distance of about ninety miles, is in a direction west-north-west.\\footnote{Id. 303.} At Makpon-i-Shagaron, in lat. $35^\\circ 48'$, long. $74^\\circ 30'$, according to Vigne, who viewed the place at the distance of eighteen miles, the river emerges from the mountainous region, and, turning south, a course which it thenceforth continues to keep generally to the sea, takes its way through the unexplored country north of Attock. Vigne caused the part intervening between Iskardo and Makpon-i-Shagaron to be explored by his native servants, who found it to flow through a succession of rocky gorges and deep and narrow valleys, rugged and difficult, but presenting nothing else remarkable: more recently this section has been examined by Europeans. About three miles south of Makpon-i-Shagaron, it receives, from the north-west, a considerable stream, called the river of Gilghit.\\footnote{Id. 303.} Vigne, who viewed the Indus at Acho, about twenty-five miles below\nthis confluence, describes it there as a vast torrent rushing through a valley six or seven miles wide, and holding a south-westerly course, which might be traced downwards for at least forty-five miles. From thence to Derbend, a distance of about 114 miles, its course lies through countries inhabited by barbarous and fanatical tribes of Mussulmans, and which does not appear to have ever been explored by Europeans. At Derbend, on the northern boundary of the British territory of the Punjab, it was in 1837 surveyed by Lieutenant Leech, of the Bengal Engineers, and there, in the middle of August, about which time it is fullest, he found it 100 yards wide. From this place, about 812 miles from its source, and in lat. $34^\\circ 18'$, long. $72^\\circ 54'$, he descended the river on a raft to Attock, a distance of about sixty miles. In this interval, the river, flowing through a plain, has a broad channel of no great depth, containing many islands, and is fordable in five places.\n\nThe fords are only available in winter, when the river is lowest, and even then the attempt is perilous, from the rapidity of the current and the benumbing coldness of the water. If the account given by Masson be correct, 1,200 horsemen were swept away and drowned on one occasion when the Indus was crossed by Runjeet Singh at one of these fords. Hough states the number lost at 7,000. Shah Shooja forded the Indus in 1809 above Attock, but his success was considered to be almost a miracle. Where crossed by Forster, about twenty miles above Attock, in the middle of July, and consequently when fullest, it was three-quarters of a mile or a mile in breadth, with a rough and rapid current, endangering the ferry-boat, though large enough to contain seventy persons, together with much merchandise and some horses. Close above Attock, the Indus receives, on the western side, the great river of Kabool, which drains the extensive basin of Kabool, the northern declivity of Sufeid Koh, the southern declivity of Hindoo Koosh and Chitral, and the other extensive valleys which furrow this last great range on the south. Both rivers have large volumes of water, and are very rapid, and as they meet amidst numerous rocks, the confluence is turbulent, and attended with great noise. The Kabool river appears to have nearly as much water as the Indus, and in one respect has an advantage over it, being\nnavigable for forty miles above the confluence, while the upward navigation of the Indus is rendered impracticable by a very violent rapid, immediately above the junction. Both rivers have gold in their sands, in the vicinity of Attock. It is obtained in various places along the upper course of the Indus, or its tributaries; as at Gartope, in Hundes, and also near the confluence of the Shy-yok, and near Iskardo. Attock, just below the confluence of the Kabool river, about 872 miles from the supposed source of the Indus, and in lat. 38\u00b0 54', long. 72\u00b0 16', is remarkable, as being the limit of the upward navigation of the latter river, and the place most frequented for passage over it from Hindostan to Afghanistan. The passage is, for the greater part of the year, made by bridges of boats, of which there are two: one is above the fort of Attock, where the river is 800 feet wide; the other below, where it is above 540 feet wide. Wood found the depth at Attock, in August, to be sixty feet; the rate of the current six miles an hour; the breadth, where he measured it above the place of the bridge, 858 feet. The inundation affects the depth and speed of the current, rather than the breadth, at Attock. This remarkable point is about 1,000 feet above the sea, and consequently about 17,000 feet below the source of the Indus, which falls, therefore, to that extent in 872 miles. This is at the average rate of about twenty feet per mile. The length of its channel from Attock to the sea is 942 miles, and consequently, in that lower part of its course, it falls little more than a foot per mile.\n\nAt Attock, the river, flowing generally south-south-west, as it does below Derbend, enters a deep rocky channel in the Salt range, or secondary mountains, which connect the eastern extremity of Sufeid Koh with the base of the Himalaya, in the Punjab. In this part of its course, the river, as well as the fort on its left or eastern bank, is known by the name of Attock, in consequence, as is generally supposed, of the prohibition under which the Hindoos originally lay of passing it\n\n* Burnes (Personal Narrative, 112-120) reached Peshawur by water, a distance of about fifty miles from Attock, and, consequently, the Kabool river and its tributary, by ascending which this was effected, cannot have a fall much exceeding a foot per mile. Griffith (Append. to Hough, 74) ascertained the height of Peshawur to be 1,068 feet. It may, therefore, be safely concluded that the height of Attock above the sea is about 1,000 feet.\nwestward. For about ten miles below Attock, the river, though in general rolling between high cliffs of slate rock, has a calm, deep, and rapid current; but for above 100 miles farther down, to Kala-Bagh, it becomes an enormous torrent, whirling and rolling among huge boulders and ledges of rock, and between precipices rising nearly perpendicularly several hundred feet from the water's edge. The water here is a dark lead-colour, and hence the name Nilab, or \"blue river,\" given as well to the Indus as to a town on its banks, about twelve miles below Attock. At Ghora Trup, about twenty miles below Attock, the immense body of water passes through a channel only 250 feet wide, but having a depth of 180 feet, the velocity being about ten miles an hour.\n\nWood, describing the course of the river from Attock to Kala-Bagh, says, \"It here rushes down a valley varying from 100 to 400 yards wide, between precipitous banks from 70 to 700 feet high.\" During inundation, the river rises in this part about fifty feet. It is obvious, that at the season when this occurs, extending from the end of May to September, the upward voyage is impracticable. The downward voyage may at all times be performed, though attended with considerable danger during inundation. It has been suggested, that there are several places along this rock-bound channel where it would be practicable to construct an iron bridge across the river, the breadth at various points not exceeding 300 feet (sometimes falling short of this), and the banks being solid limestone. The natives frequently venture down this vast torrent, floating on a mussuk or inflated hide. The boats employed here are called duggahs, and are heavier and more strongly built than the dundis, or boats used in the lower part of the river. The upward voyage, when practicable, is effected by means of tracking,\u2014sails resorted to previously, being either useless, from the prevalence of dead calm, or dangerous, in consequence of the varying and violent squalls produced in the current of air by the effect of the lofty and irregular banks. As the river\n\n* According to Wilford (As. Res. vi. 529), Attaca, or \"the forbidden.\" The prohibition of crossing seems, however, pretty generally set at naught, as was seen in the case of the Hindoos in the British armies invading Afghanistan. Hough (334) derives the name from Atuk or Utuk, \"prevention\" or \"obstacle.\"\napproaches the plain country below Kala-Bagh, the channel expands nearly to the breadth of 500 yards; just above that town the width is 481 yards. Below Kala-Bagh, in lat. 32\u00b0 57', long. 71\u00b0 36', and about 830 miles from the mouth, the river enters the plain, the east or left bank here becoming low, while on the right the Khussoree Hills rise abruptly from the water, having, as Burnes observes, \"the appearance of a vast fortress, formed by nature, with the Indus as its ditch.\" Along the base of these hills, which stretch south-south-west for about seventy miles, the channel is deep, generally having soundings about sixty feet. On entering the plain, the water loses its clearness, and becomes loaded with mud. In inundation, the depth of the stream is not so much affected in this part of its course as are the breadth and velocity; and here, as well as in the Delta, the river, when swollen, overflows the adjacent country to a great extent. From Kala-Bagh, southwards, to Mittunkote, distant about 350 miles, the banks, either right or left, or both, are in several places so low, that the first rise of the river covers the country around with water, extending, as the inundation advances, as far as the eye can reach. On this portion of the river's course Wood says:\u2014\"So diffused was the stream, that from a boat in its centre no land could be discovered, save the islands upon its surface, and the mountains on its western shore. From Dera Ismael Khan to Kala-Bagh, a distance of above 100 miles, the eastern bank cannot once be seen from the opposite side of the river, being either obscured by distance or hidden by interjacent islands.\" These islands, when the river is low, are gentle elevations of the mainland, much frequented on account of the luxuriant pasture; but during the season of inundation, they, as well as the immediate banks, are deserted, in consequence of the danger resulting from the sudden, irregular, and irresistible irruptions of the current. \"In this month\" (July), observes Wood, \"the islands are abandoned, and as the boat swiftly glides amidst the mazy channels that intersect them, no village cheers the sight, no human voice is heard; and, out of sight of land, the voyager may for hours be floating amidst a wilderness of green island fields.\" The habitations are generally placed at a considerable distance from the banks. If this precaution be disregarded, they are exposed to the fate of Dera Ismael Khan.\na large town, which, with its flourishing palm-groves, was totally swept away in 1829. Sometimes the Indus suffers very sudden and extraordinary changes. For instance, on one occasion, at the setting in of night, Wood found it to have an unbroken expanse of 2,274 yards in breadth, and next morning its bed was a confused mass of sand-banks, in which the main channel was only 259 yards wide; this extraordinary change having occurred in consequence of a great body of the water of the river having made its escape into a low tract in the vicinity of its course. As the inundation originates in the melting of the snows in the Hindoo Koosh and the Himalaya, it commences with spring, and retrogrades as autumn advances; and so regular is this process, that, according to Wood, it begins to rise on the 23rd of March, and to subside on the 23rd of September, its maximum being about the 6th or 7th of August. The average rise of the inundation between Kala-Bagh and Mittunkote is eight feet and a half; the declivity of the water's edge is eight inches per mile. In this part of its course, with the exception of the Koorum, the Indus receives scarcely any accession to its water. Higher up it has a few tributaries, though of no great importance. Thus, on the right, or west bank, in lat. 33\u00b0 25', long. 71\u00b0 52', the Toe, described by Elphinstone as a deep and clear stream, falls into it. On the left, or east side, in lat. 33\u00b0 47', long. 72\u00b0 16', the Indus receives the Hurroo, a small stream; and on the same side, lower down, in lat. 33\u00b0 1', long. 71\u00b0 46', the Swan, also an inconsiderable stream. The Indus, between Kula-Bagh and Mittun Kote, in consequence of the great breadth of its channel, is scarcely affected by rain; but in the narrow part, above Kala-Bagh, it sometimes rises eight or nine feet in a short time from this cause.\n\nIn many places where the river flows through the plain, there is an inner and an outer bank. The outer banks run at a great distance from each other, and between them, during inundation, the vast body of water rolls often in several channels, separated by shifting islands: when the river is low, this great course becomes a shallow valley of very irregular breadth, and the shrunken river meanders along its bottom. If the outer banks were continuous, the river would roll along in a stream varying in breadth according to the greater or less degree of inundation; but at all times, even when fullest, in a defined\nchannel of moderate breadth, though varying greatly in different parts. In many places, however, the outer bank is wanting, and, during inundation, the river expands over the country, converting it into an extensive lake. Between Mittunkote and Bukkur, the inundation extends sometimes twenty miles from the western side of the river, in its low state, and ten or twelve from the eastern side. Wood gives the width of the shrunken river as varying from 480 to 1,600 yards, and the average width at about 680 yards; its usual maxima of depth at nine, twelve, or fifteen feet: but its bed is so irregular, and so liable to be obstructed by shifting shoals, that though it cannot be regularly and safely forded in any part, except that intervening between Torbela and Attock, its navigation, even below the confluence of the Kabool, cannot be effected at all times, and continuously throughout its whole course, by boats drawing more than thirty inches water. The general velocity of the stream in its shrunken state is estimated by Wood at three miles an hour; but he observes, \"it is scarcely necessary to remark, that the three last items (breadth, depth, velocity) are very inconstant. At no two places are the measurements exactly alike, nor do they continue the same at one place for a single week.\" In fact, the breadth, during inundation, is only 250 feet at Ghora Trup; and below Mittunkote, it in one place amounts to thirty miles; the depth at the same time and place is 186 feet, and in other places only twelve feet: the velocity at Ghora Trup, during the inundation, is ten miles an hour; at other places, not half that, and when the river is low, often not more than two miles an hour.\n\nThe general course of the river is a little west of south from Attock to the confluence of the Punjnad, the channel which conveys the collected streams of the Punjab. This confluence is on the left or eastern side of the Indus, two or three miles below Mittunkote, in lat. 28\u00b0 55', long. 70\u00b0 28', and about 490 miles from the sea. Above the confluence, the breadth of the Indus is less than that of the other river, but, in consequence of the greater depth and velocity, the former has the greater volume of water. Wood found the Indus having a breadth of 608 yards, a velocity of about five miles an hour, a depth of twelve or fifteen feet, and discharging 91,719 cubic feet per second. The Punjnad had a breadth of 1,766 yards,\na velocity of about two miles an hour, a depth of twelve or fifteen feet, and discharged 68,955 cubic feet per second. Below the confluence, the Indus is in its lowest state 2,000 yards wide. Its aspect in this part is well described by Boileau. \"At the place where we crossed the Indus, almost immediately below its junction with the Punjnad, its stream is 2,047 yards, or nearly a mile and a quarter, in breadth, at a place where its width was unbroken either by islands or sand-banks. The banks are very low, and the water very muddy, having just begun to rise, from the melting of the snows at its sources; nor is the stream of very great depth, except in the main channel; but with all these drawbacks, it is a magnificent sheet of water\u2014a very prince of rivers.\" For a considerable distance above and below Mittunkote, the country is low,* and the inundation extensive, reaching to Shikarpoor, and even to some places distant from the river twenty miles to the west, and extending eight or ten miles to the east. Lower down, at Rorce, the stream makes its way through a low ridge of limestone and flint, which stretches from the mountains of Cutch Gundava,\u2020 eastward, to Jessulmair. There are strong indications that the stream, in remote ages, swept far eastward along their northern base, and irrigated the level tract at present desert, but exhibiting numerous proofs that it once was traversed by large streams,\u2021 and was both fertile and populous. At present, this ridge is cut, not only by the Indus, but, a few miles farther east, by the Eastern Narra, which diverges from the main stream, on the eastern side, a short distance above Rorce, and takes a south-easterly course through the desert, in which it is usually lost, though in violent inundations it rolls onward to the sea in a great volume of water, discharging itself through the Koree, or most eastern mouth, which is in general quite deserted by the fresh water. At Rorce there are four rocky islets, the largest of which, that of Bukkur, contains an extensive fort, and divides the river into two channels. Fifty miles below this place, the Western Narra, a great and permanent branch, divaricates from the Indus on the western side,\n\n* Such is the statement of Wood (in Burnes, Personal Narr. 341); Lord, on the contrary (Medical Mem. 64), states that the banks below Mittunkote are not much inundated; but Wood's industrious research and general accuracy are well known.\nand, after a tortuous course of nearly 120 miles, rejoins the main stream about four miles south-east of Sehwan. A little above that town, the Narra has a large but shallow expansion, called Lake Manchur, varying in circuit from thirty to fifty miles, according to the greater or less degree of inundation. This great watercourse, in the part intervening between Lake Manchur and the Indus, has a name distinct from that of the Narra, being called the Arul. From Sehwan, downwards, to the efflux of the Fulailee, a distance of about eighty miles, the bed of the river is much depressed below the level of the adjacent country, and the banks are elevated from sixteen to twenty feet above the surface in the low season; in this part of the course, inundations rarely overspread the country, and irrigation is effected by raising the water with the Persian wheel. The Fulailee, a large branch, though yearly diminishing, leaves the Indus, on the eastern side, about twelve miles north of Hyderabad, and, flowing south-east, insulates the Gunjah Hills, on which that town is built, as, about fifteen miles below it, an offset running westward rejoins the main stream. At Triecal, where is the point of reunion, in lat. $25^\\circ 9'$, long. $68^\\circ 21'$, the Delta commences; all below it, and contained between the Fulailee on the east, and the extreme western branch of the Indus, being, with little exception, alluvial, and obviously deposited by the river. The Fulailee holds a southeasterly course, in the lower part of which it bears the name of the Gonnee, which, communicating, during high inundations, with the Phurraun, is thereby discharged into the sea through the Koree mouth. The Koree mouth may more properly be termed an arm of the sea, as the water is salt, and it receives a current from the Indus only during inundations of unusual height. Burnes found it seven miles wide and twenty feet deep at Cotasir, about twenty miles from the open sea. Some suppose it to have once been the principal mouth of the Indus, constantly discharging the water of the Narra, which they consider to have been the chief branch. It is at present the most eastern of the estuaries connected with the Indus. The Pinyaree, a wide branch, which diverges from the Indus at Bunna, about forty miles below Hyderabad, is navigable, downwards, to within fifty miles of the sea: at that distance the navigation is closed by a bund or dam, thrown across it at\nMaghribee; but as the water makes its way through small creeks in time of inundation, the navigation recommences below the bund, and continues to the sea. The Pinyarce discharges itself through the Sir estuary, two miles wide at its mouth, with a depth on the bar of one fathom, and of from four to six inside: it is next, westward, to the Koree mouth. At about six miles above Tatta, the Kulairee, a small branch, leaves the Indus on the right or western side, and may be considered to mark the commencement of the Delta on that side. Were not its water lost by absorption and evaporation, it would generally insulate Tatta, as it now does occasionally.\n\nAt about five miles below Tatta, and sixty miles from the sea, the Indus is divided into two great branches,\u2014the Buggaur, which flows westward, and the Sata, which maintains the previous course of the Indus southward, and is in strictness the continuation of that river. The Mull and the Moutnee, formerly great branches, leaving the left or eastern side of the Sata, are now so diminished as to be almost dry. The estuaries, however, remain: that of the Mull is navigable for boats; it is the mouth next westward of the Sir; and beyond this, in the same direction, is the Kaha, or estuary of the Moutnee, at present unnavigable. A few miles further west is the Kookywarree mouth, now blocked up by a sand-bank, but forming, in 1837, when Carless published his account, \"the grand embouchure of the Indus,\" having a breadth of 1,100 yards. Even then, however, the navigation was rendered difficult by an enormous bank stretching across it, and extending five miles out to sea. The Sata now discharges the great bulk of its waters through the Kedewarree, the next mouth proceeding westward, the embouchure of which was considerably diverted during the inundation of 1848. Its channel is well defined, having no less than from seven to eight feet water at low spring tides. Following the line of coast in a north-westerly direction, the next estuary is that of the Hujamree, where the English force, advancing in 1838 on Affghanistan, were landed. Next in succession, in the same direction, is the Jooa mouth, leading by the river of the same name to the Buggaur, and practicable to the junction for river steamers during the floods. During the low season, the estuaries of both the Jooa and Hujamree are safe roads for ingress or\nINDUS.\n\negress, independent of fresh-water discharge. The Dubbar and Gorabee, now united, form the next mouth, which has five feet on the bar at low water; beyond which is the Pityanee, also communicating with the Buggaur, by which it was for a time deserted. Further on is the Cooddee mouth, having five feet at low water; and this is succeeded by the Pitty, one of the largest, deepest, and best-defined of the mouths of the Indus, and much frequented by steamers to and from Kurrachee. Next, and last, is the Gizree, the estuary of a branch of the Indus formerly obliterated, but again rendered navigable for boats, though having but two feet water at its mouth at low tide.\n\nThe distance from the Koree estuary, in the south-east, to the mouth of Gizree creek, in the north-west, is about 130 miles, and such is, consequently, the length of the seacoast of the Delta. There are several mouths of less importance, and the enumeration of which is unnecessary. There are also numerous intricate cross-channels, allowing an inland navigation for small vessels between the various creeks and branches. To sum up briefly this involved subject\u2014during the season of low water, the Indus falls into the sea by only one channel of any importance: this, called the Sata, Munnejah, or Wanyanee, has its efflux by the Kedewarree mouth, the entrance of which is very unsafe, and consequently avoided by coasting craft. \"Impetuous currents and shifting sands are dangers they are not disposed to encounter. Sharp vessels grounding on such a locality seldom escape serious disaster, a few hours being sufficient to engulf them in a bed of sand, from which no human aid or skill can extricate them.\" The other mouths, with the exception of the Pitty, are, in the season of low water, little more than creeks silted up and closed at various distances from the sea. The number of these creeks or estuaries at present at all worth noticing, is thirteen, occurring in the following order in proceeding from south-east to north-west: the Koree, Seer, Mull, Kaha, Kookewarree, Kedywarree, Hujamree, Jooa, Durbar, Pitteeanee, Coondee, Pitty, and Gizree. The tide influences the Indus nearly up to Tatta, a distance of about seventy miles. The spring tide rises nine feet.\n\nThe description above given of the mouths and lower\nbranches of the Indus is mainly applicable to their state when the river is lowest. When the river is at its height, as Burnes\\(^1\\) observes, \"the great branches of this river are of themselves so numerous, and throw off such an incredible number of arms, that the inundation is general; and in those places which are denied this advantage by fortuitous circumstances, artificial drains, about four feet wide and three deep, conduct the water through the fields.\" For about twenty miles from the sea, the whole country is nearly submerged. At this season, the water of the sea is fresh for some distance from the land, and discoloured for a still greater.\\(^2\\) The quantity of water discharged by the Indus is by no means proportionate to the enormous supplies derived from its numerous tributaries: the larger portion seems lost by evaporation, absorption, and employment for irrigation in a sultry climate where rain seldom falls. Wood and Lord\\(^3\\) state the maximum discharge in August, at 446,080 cubic feet per second, and in December, at 40,857 cubic feet per second. The water in the early part of the season of inundation is very unwholesome, in consequence of the great quantity of decayed vegetable and animal matter held in suspension by it. Lord,\\(^4\\) who made experiments by desiccating the water and weighing the residuum, computes that the quantity of silt annually discharged by the river, during the seven months of inundation, would suffice to form an island or bank forty-two miles long, twenty-seven miles broad, and forty feet deep; but it is clear, that this computation must be received with great allowances, as, according to it, the land of Sinde must have been much farther advanced into the Indian Ocean than it is found to be. After the early part of the season of inundation, if the water be preserved until the earthy admixture has subsided, it is both palatable and wholesome.\n\nThe Indus is infested by alligators;\\(^5\\) they are of the guryial or long-snouted kind, the common kind being unknown in the river, though numerous in lagoons near Kurrachee. The bolas,\\(^6\\) a cetaceous animal, the size of a porpoise, is common. Nowhere\n\n\\(^*\\) The junction of the fresh and salt water, according to Burnes, is \"without violence, and might be now and then discovered by a small streak of foam and a gentle ripple.\" Pottinger states, that it causes \"a very confused rippling\" (p. 9).\nare fish finer or more abundant, and they form a large portion of the sustenance of the population of the adjacent country. Westmacott enumerates sixteen kinds, some as long as six or seven feet. The pulla, a species of carp, is a rich and delicious fish, though bony to a degree dangerous to an incautious eater. It is largely consumed on the spot, and also dried for exportation, forming an important article in the scanty trade of Sinde. The fisherman of the pulla floats, with his breast downwards, on an oblong earthen vessel, closed in all parts except an orifice, which he covers by applying his stomach to it. In this position, he passes along, taking the fish with a net at the end of a long bamboo, and depositing it in the vessel.\n\nWood observes, that \"the population of the banks of the Indus are almost amphibious. The boatmen of Lower Sinde, for example, live, like the Chinese, in their boats. If a native of the Lower Indus has occasion to cross the stream, a pulla-jar wafts him to the opposite shore. At Bukkur, the musseuk (inflated hide) supersedes the pulla-jar; and from Mittunkote upwards, every man living near the river has one. Kossids (couriers) so mounted make surprising journeys, and the soldier, with sword and matchlock secured across his shoulders, thus avoids the fatigue of a long march.\" The leisure time of every description of persons is spent in the water, or floating on it. Such familiarity with the water naturally inclines the population to regard it as the great medium of commercial intercourse, and Hamilton, who visited Sinde at the close of the seventeenth century, found the traffic considerable. Until within the last few years, the trade of the Indus was obstructed, and in many places destroyed, by the oppression and vexatious rapacity of the various petty powers and tribes claiming sovereignty over divers parts of its course. The success of the British arms has led to the restoration of a better state of things. The doondah, or boat generally used in Lower Sinde, is a clumsy vehicle, flat-bottomed, of capacity varying from thirty to fifty tons, with bow and stern, each forming a broad inclined plane, having, the former, an angle with the surface of the water of about twenty, the latter of about forty degrees. The jumpees, or state barges of the ameers, were of considerable dimensions. Wood measured one 120 feet long, eighteen\nand a half broad, and drawing two feet six inches water. In the upper part of the Indus, the boat chiefly used is the zohruk, in most respects resembling the doondah, except that it is smaller, lighter, and more manageable. The duggah, used only in the boisterous part of the current above Kala-Bagh, is very strongly built, with stern and bow greatly projecting, to keep away the hull from the bank, in case of collision with it. It is so heavy and unmanageable, that if brought far down the river, it is usually disposed of there, to save the labour and expense of tracking it back. In proceeding up the stream when the wind is unfavourable, as is generally the case during the half-year between the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, way must be made exclusively by tracking. During the other half-year southerly winds prevail, and the boats run up under sail before it, except where the use of sails becomes dangerous from peculiar circumstances. Steam will doubtless be found highly efficient in navigating the Indus. Communication by its means has indeed been already established between Kurrachee and Mooltan, by government vessels, for goods and passengers; an advantage which it is confidently believed will shortly be extended to Kala-Bagh, on the Indus, and to the town of Jhelum, on the tributary of that name. The principal obstacle to its general employment is the dearness and inferior quality of the firewood of Sinde; but coal has been discovered near the Indus, both in the Punjab and on the western bank of the river, though further investigation is required as to its quality and quantity.\n\nIn estimating the advantages to be drawn from the navigation of the Indus, reference should be had, not only to the home consumption of Sinde and the Punjab, but also to the demand of the various marts of those countries through which Afghanistan, Khorasan, and Central Asia are largely supplied; and the best means of advancing this most important branch of trade, have been deemed to be the establishment of grand periodical fairs at suitable points on the banks of the Indus, and in affording facilities of communication and protection to the commercial classes. Kurrachee and Sukkur have been selected as sites for this purpose.\n\nAlthough some of the particulars following have been already noticed, it may be convenient, in conclusion, to bring them into\none view. The length of the navigable part of the river from the sea to Attock has been ascertained, by measurement, to be 942 miles; that of the upper part is about 860 miles; making a total length, in round numbers, of 1,800 miles. The average declivity of the watercourse from the supposed locality of the source to Attock is, per mile, twenty-four feet; from Attock downwards to Kala-Bagh, a distance of about 110 miles, it is twenty inches; from this last place to Mittunkote, a distance of about 350 miles, it is eight inches; and thence to the sea, six inches. The Indus is probably destined to be an important channel of political and commercial communication.\n\nINGEMOOR.\u2014A town in the British district of Nellore, presidency of Madras, 129 miles N.N.W. of Madras.

It flows in a direction from north to south, traversing the heart of the Burmese territories, which it separates into two nearly equal divisions. After a course of 790 miles, it reaches the southern frontier of Burmah, and crossing over into the British province of Pegu, pursues its way for a further distance of 270 miles, reaching the Bay of Bengal by several mouths, which form the delta of the Irrawaddy. At the distance of 540 miles from its source, it passes the Burmese town of Ummerapoora; and a few miles farther, it flows past the capital of the empire, sixty-five miles beyond which it receives, on the right side, its great confluent the Khyendwen, flowing also from the north. The course of the united stream through the Burmese territory continues for the further distance of 180 miles. Fifty miles below the southern frontier of Burmah, as at present defined, it passes the British town of Prome; ninety miles below which it diverges into two principal branches, each measuring about 130 miles in length. The more easterly of these branches is\n\n\u00b9 Horsburgh, Directory, ii. 33.\ndesignated the Rangoon or Siriam river, from the cities of those names built upon its banks; and it falls into the Gulf of Martaban, in lat. $16^\\circ 28'$, long. $96^\\circ 24'$. The other main branch, intersecting the province in a south-westerly direction, is known as the river of Bassein, and discharges itself into the Bay of Bengal, in lat. $15^\\circ 50'$, long. $94^\\circ 26'$. Innumerable watercourses, forming the delta, are thrown off from these two rivers.\n\nFrom experiments instituted in 1852 across the river at Prome, to ascertain the velocity of the current, it appeared that the fall of the stream from October to February amounted to about twenty feet; the mean depth on the 25th April was found to range from twelve to thirteen feet; and its mean speed was computed at about two miles per hour.\\(^1\\) The Bassein branch affords a passage for the largest ships for sixty miles from its mouth, and for forty miles further for vessels of 300 tons. No river of similar magnitude, it is stated, presents so few obstructions.\\(^2\\) According to the theory of M. Klaproth\\(^3\\) and the Chinese geographers, the Irrawaddy is a continuation of the Sanpo of Thibet; but though absolute proof be yet wanting of the identity of the latter with the Brahmapootra, little doubt appears to be now entertained on this point. A high authority,\\(^4\\) exploring the Irrawaddy at a spot obviously at no great distance from its source, observes: \"The Irrawaddy we were surprised to find but a small river, smaller even than we anticipated, though aware of the proximity of its sources. It was not more than eighty yards broad, and still fordable, though considerably swollen by the melting snows; the bed was of rounded stones, and both above and below where we stood, we could see numerous shallow rapids. As to the origin of the river, I felt perfectly satisfied from the moment I made inquiries at Sadiya; but since further evidence, founded on the report of the natives, might not have satisfied those who had adopted M. Klaproth's opinion, that the waters of the Sanpo find an outlet through the channel of the Irrawaddy, I had resolved, if possible, to have ocular and incontrovertible demonstration; and I could not help exulting, when standing on the edge of the clear stream, at the successful result of our toils and fatigues. Before us, to the north, rose a towering wall, stretching from west to east, offering an\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Journ. As. Soc. Beng. 1863, p. 480.\n\n\\(^2\\) Admiral Sir Edward Owen, in Med.

Klaproth proved determined to make his Sanpoo pass by Ava, he must find a river for his purpose considerably removed towards or into China.\" A chart of the Irrawaddy from Rangoon to Yandaboo has been published, and further attempts to explore this river have, it is believed, been successful in adding somewhat to the stock of knowledge on the subject. But at present their results are not available for general use, as no public communication, either official or otherwise, has yet been made of them. A short time will probably throw open the discoveries to all who may take an interest in the matter.\n\nISAKHANKAKOT,1 in Sirhind, a village with a small fort, on the route from Loodianah to Ferozpoor, and 46 miles W. of the former town. It is situate in an open, level country, partially cultivated, and capable of yielding supplies for a moderate number of troops. Water is abundant, and the road in this part of the route generally good, though in some places sandy, yet not so much so as to present serious difficulties for guns or carriages.

Distant N. from Calcutta 13 miles. Lat. 22\u00b0 36', long. 88\u00b0 23'.\n\nISKARDOH,1 the capital of Bultistan, is situate in an elevated plain, forming the bottom of a valley embosomed in stupendous ranges of mountains. The plain or valley of Iskardoh is nineteen miles long and seven broad.2 Its soil is\nISKARDOH.\n\nformed of the detritus brought down and deposited by the Indus, and by its great tributary the Shighur river; the confluence being at the northern base of the rock on which the fort is built. The killah or rock, the site of the fort, is on the left bank of the Indus, here a deep and rapid torrent, above 150 yards wide.* It is two miles long, and at the eastern end, where it is highest, rises nearly perpendicularly 800 feet above the river, from a buttress of sand, loose stones, and broken rocks. The killah has this mural face on every side, except the west, where it slopes steeply to the plain. Vigne considers that it could be rendered as strong as Gibraltar, to which, in appearance, it bears much resemblance. The castle of the former sovereigns of Bultistan stands on a small natural platform about 300 feet above the bed of the river, and is built of stone, with a framework of timber, and numerous strong defences against musketry. It is approached by a steep zigzag path, traversed by gateways and wooden defences, several of which are also disposed in such parts of the sides of the rock as require to be strengthened. There is a look-out house on a peak, a little above the castle, and another on the summit above that. Everything in the interior of this stronghold is constructed for defence rather than comfort, the place \"being a confusion of break-neck stairs, low doors, and dark passages.\" There is a splendid view of the valley and the river from the windows. The highest summit of the rock is a small level space of a triangular shape, and here are piled stones, ready to be rolled down for the destruction of assailants. It is scarcely accessible, except on the western side; and there, at a height of about 200 feet, the acclivity is strongly fortified by walls and square towers. The formation of the rock is gneiss. There is no water in the upper part of the killah, but below the castle is a fine spring. The residence of the population attached to the seat of government of this fallen state is on the plain at the base of the rock, and can, according to Vigne,4 \"hardly be called a town, being a straggling collection of houses.\" The number of these houses is estimated by Moorcroft5 at 150. Vigne displays the enthusiasm of an ardent admirer of the picturesque in describing the appearance of this singular and secluded place,\n\n* According to Vigne (ii. 245). Moorcroft states it to be 800 yards wide (ii. 262).\n\n\u2020 Moorcr. Punj.

The stream from the valley of Shighur, which joins the Indus, as it washes its foot, was visible from the spot where I stood, but the latter river was hidden by the height of its left bank, whilst on the north, and wherever the eye could rove, arose with surpassing grandeur a vast assemblage of the enormous summits that compose the Tibetan Himalaya.\" 6\n\nRespecting the origin of Iskardoh, Wade mentions an absurd tradition, which at least has the interest of novelty for those whose knowledge of the exploits of \"the great Emathian conqueror\" is derived from classical sources. It is, \"that Alexander the Great came here on an expedition towards Khata, or Scythia (modern China), and that the Koteli Mustak, or the Mustak Mountains, which lie between Yargand and Khata, being at that time impassable on account of the depth and severity of the snow, the Macedonian halted on the present site of the capital until a road could be cleared for his passage; when, leaving every part of his superfluous baggage, together with the sick, old, and infirm of his troops, behind in a fort which he erected while there, he advanced against Khata. These relics of the army founded a city, which they named Iskandaria, or Alexandria, now pronounced Iskardoh.\" The tradition received no countenance from Ahmed Shah, the intelligent gylo or sovereign of the country, to whom Moorcroft applied for information on this curious subject. Neither the gylo, nor any other inquirer, had been able to find any trace of Greek colonists. Vigne, who at one time maintained the fabulous Greek origin of Iskardoh, in retraction states, that \"Iskardo, Skardo, or Kardo, as it is sometimes called, is obviously only an abbreviation of Sagars Do, the two floods or rivers.\" He then mentions, that the people of Ladakh called it Sagar Khood, and adds, \"Sagara is an old Sanscrit word for the ocean; and in this case Sagar Khood may signify the valley of the great flood or river: do, signifying two in Persian and its cognates, is added to the\nname Sagar, because the open space is formed by the junction of two streams, the Indus and the Shighur river.\" The plain or bottom of the valley of Iskardoh is 6,300 feet above the sea, and the summit of the rock is 7,200 above the same level. Ahmed Shah, the late native sovereign, had ruled the country with a moderation and paternal regard for his people little known among Asiatic despots. He made some unsuccessful efforts to become a protected vassal of our Indian government, as he justly dreaded the power, rapacity, and cruelty of the Sikhs. His fears proved true, as, a short time since, Iskardoh, notwithstanding its great natural strength, was seized by Golab Singh, the present ruler of Cashmere. Iskardoh is in lat. 35\u00b0 12', long. 75\u00b0 35'.\n\nISLAMABAD, in Cashmere, a town situate on the north side of the Behut or Jhelum, here navigable, and running with a gentle current. The river is about eighty yards wide, and is crossed by a wooden bridge. Islamabad is built at the extremity of a long, low eminence, extending from the mountains eastward. At the foot of this eminence is a spacious reservoir, of a triangular shape, supplied by a copious spring of clear water, slightly sulphureous, and from which gas is continually evolved. This spring, called Anat Nag, is supposed to have been produced by Vishnu. The gas does not prevent the water from swarming with fish, which are considered sacred. There are about 300 shops of shawl-weavers at Islamabad, and a considerable quantity of chintzes, coarse cottons, and woollens are also manufactured here. Its name was originally Anat Nag, which, in the fifteenth century, was changed to that which it now bears.

It is a recent acquisition of the khan of Bhawlpoor, who made himself master of it at the expense of Jessulmere. The fort is a very ancient structure of small bricks, and has an area of about eighty yards square, with very lofty ramparts, varying in height from thirty to fifty feet. At the north-east angle is a high gateway, covered by an outwork. There are numerous bastions on the north and east faces, but few on the others. There is no ditch, and the situation is\nISL\u2014ISR.\n\nunfavourable for defence, as it is commanded on every side by sand-hills eighty feet high, and less than a quarter of a mile distant.

It is situate at the confluence of the rivers Bes and Patra, the waters of which supply a ditch, extending from one to the other; so that the town, and a fort of masonry$^3$ within, are by this means completely insulated. It was originally called Jugdispur, and received its present name from Dost Muhammad Khan, the founder of the state of Bhopal, who took it by surprise$^4$ from a Hindoo zemindar, its previous holder.

The channel or river of Aibika is wide, but admits small craft only, having at its entrance a bar, with only five or six feet of water when highest. A large ship, taking in cargo here, must anchor in the open sea, in six or seven fathoms of water, a considerable distance from the shore.

Lat. 28\u00b0 59', long. 76\u00b0 54'.\n\nJABOOAH,\u2020 in Malwa, a town, the chief place of a small\n\n* Yeddapulley of Trig. Survey; Edapalli of Bartolomeo.\n\u2020 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.; Voyage to the East Indies (Translation), 187.\nterritory of the same name, lies on the route from Mhow to Deesa, 92 miles W. of the former, 234 S. of the latter. It is inclosed by a wall of mud, with circular bastions of masonry, and is beautifully situate in a valley lying at the eastern base of a ridge of hills. On the north bank of a fine lake, south of the town, is the fortified palace of the petty rajah or chief. The boundaries of his small territory are as follow:\u2014On the north, Banswarra; north-east, a portion of Holcar\u2019s territory; south-east, Amjherra; south, Alee Rajpore; and west, a portion of Scindia\u2019s territory, and Dohud. The area contains 1,348 square miles. The population consists principally of Bheels, of the more civilized classes, and is returned at 132,104. The annual revenue of the territory, in 1840, was stated at 144,536 rupees, or 14,453l. This is inclusive of the income derived from certain territories farmed from Holcar, which is said to amount to about 35,000 rupees (3,500l.). It is believed that the Jabooah state derives no pecuniary benefit from this farm, but, on the contrary, sustains some loss; but the districts of which it consists lying intermingled with the territory of Jabooah, the administration of them is a desirable object, with a view to security and the maintenance of order. A small military force appears to be maintained by this state, but, in order that its contribution in aid of the Malwa Bheel corps might be less onerous, it was proposed to incorporate in that corps such of the troops as were disposed to enlist into it.\n\nThe rajahs of Jabooah claim descent from the Rattore princes of Joudpore. Bhunjee, one of their ancestors, commanded 400 horse at Delhi, and his son, Kishen Doss, was placed in attendance on the prince Allah-oo-Deen, to whom, subsequently to his accession to the throne, he rendered considerable service by regaining possession of Dacca, which had been withheld by a rebellious governor. For this service, he was requited by liberal grants of territory. Jabooah was at that time subject to Suka Naiga, a Bheel ruler and notorious freebooter, who, in conjunction with a Rajpoot chief named Chunderbahn, ruler of Dholitah, had plundered and murdered the family and followers of the governor of Guzerat. Kishen Doss was ordered to revenge this wrong, and set about the task in the only way probably in which he was likely to succeed. Disguising himself as a horsedealer, he proceeded to\nJabooah with some remarkably fine specimens of the animal in which he professed to deal, and having won the favour and confidence of the Bheel chief, by allowing him to obtain the horses at very low prices, he lured him to a carousal, and taking advantage of the moment when excess had wrought its work, put him and his principal adherents to the sword. The zeal and success with which he had executed his instructions, procured him a grant of the dominions of the slaughtered chief, and henceforth Kishen Doss took a high place among the Hindoo dependants of the throne of Delhi. From this period, the history of the chiefs of Jabooah is not more interesting than that of the petty states around. Their territorial acquisitions were diminished by successive alienations in favour of younger branches of the family; and they shared in the common ruin which the Mahrattas spread over the face of that part of India, until the supremacy of British power and influence restored peace, and led to the introduction of a higher measure of civilization. The means taken by this state, as well as by others, to defend itself from Mahratta domination by the employment of foreign mercenary troops, increased its calamities, and extended their duration; for long after the Mahratta power had ceased to be formidable, the mercenaries, originally called in to assist it, remained a source of danger and alarm. For upwards of three years, down to 1836, the country was kept by them in a state of anarchy, which was finally suppressed only by the armed interference of the British government. Tranquillity was thereby restored, and by the deportation of the foreign troops, the country was freed from the main cause of disturbance. The rajah, being a minor, the management of the country was, at the request of the ranee, temporarily assumed by the British, under whose administration it greatly improved. Distance of the town from Neemuch, S., 120 miles; from Oojein, S.W., 80; from Bombay, N.E., 285. Lat. 22\u00b0 45', long. 74\u00b0 36'.\n\nJADUN, in the Rajpoot state of Joudpore, a village on the route from Nusseerabad to Deesa, and 97 miles S.W. of the former.

It is situate on the river Gurkpoornah, a tributary of the Godavery, and here a large stream. The town is of considerable\u00b2 size, but there does not appear to have been any further information made public concerning it. Distance from Hydrabad, N.W., 260 miles; from Aurungabad, N.E., 45; from Bombay, N.E., 220. Lat. 20\u00b0 14', long. 76\u00b0 5'.\n\nJAFFERABAD,\u00b9 in the peninsula of Kattywar, province of Guzerat, a town and seaport in the district of Babriawar, situate on the estuary of the small stream Ranuy. It is \"the best\u00b2 river on the coast, there being no bar, and the entrance easy. Although shoal, vessels will receive no damage by lying on the soft mud at low water, as they are well sheltered. The town is about a mile up the river, surrounded by a wall: next to Diu, it is the most considerable place for trade on the coast of Guzerat.\" It belongs\u00b3 to the Seedee or Abyssinian chief of Jinjira, on the coast of the southern Concan, and is governed by an officer holding under him. Jafferabad, with eleven villages annexed to it, possess\u2074 a population estimated at 5,680. Distance from Ahmedabad, S.W., 170 miles; Baroda, S.W., 150; Bombay, N.W., 165.

It has a Hindoo temple, and is supplied with water from a baoli or large well. Close to the temple is a confined encamping-ground. Lat. 29\u00b0 39', long. 79\u00b0 53'.\n\nJAGNOR, in the British district of Agra, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a small town near the southern frontier, towards Dholpoor, is situate in the pergunnah or subdivision of Sarhendi, among the sandstone hills extending southwards from Futtehpoor Sikri. It is 35 miles S.W. from the city of Agra. Lat. 26\u00b0 52', long. 77\u00b0 40'.\n\nJAGUN.\u2014A place in Sinde, 10 miles N.W. of Shikarpoor. It consists of a fort and village, with some lofty square fortified buildings outside. It has a small, but rather well-furnished bazar. Supplies may be procured in moderate quantities, and forage, both for camels and horses, is plentiful. Jagun is eleven miles and a half from Janehdurra, from which place the road lies over a level country with much wood. There is an encamping-ground on the south-east of the village. Lat. 28\u00b0 8', long. 68\u00b0 33'.\n\nJAHANPOOR, in the British district of Agra, a village on the route from the city of Agra to Jeypoor, and 24 miles W. of the former.

It is situate on the north or left bank of the Bangunga, in this part of its course called the Ootunghun, and which in the dry season is here only a small rill of clear water. In the rainy season, however, the stream becomes considerable, running in a sandy bed 180 yards wide, with steep\nbanks cut into deep ravines. The road to the north of Jahjur, or towards Agra, is rather good, and the country fertile and highly cultivated; to the south, or towards Dholpoor, the country is sandy and waste, and the road heavy. Lat. 26\u00b0 55', long. 77\u00b0 59'.\n\nJAHNUVI.\u2014A feeder of the Ganges, in the upper part of the course of the latter, where it bears the name of the Bhageerettee. The Jahnuvi has been supposed to derive its origin from the north of the culminating range of the Himalayas, within the limits of Chinese authority; but this conjecture is without foundation, it being now ascertained that the remotest source of this river is situate in British territory, on the southern base of the before-mentioned range. The Jahnuvi rises in Gurwhal, in lat. 30\u00b0 55', long. 79\u00b0 14', and, holding first a northerly, then a westerly course, joins the Bhageerettees near the Sanga of Bhairogathi. At this point the Jahnuvi is from eighty to 100 feet wide, and superior in volume to the Bhageerettee, though the latter was long considered the origin of the holy and celebrated Ganges. The Jahnuvi flowing for the distance of thirty miles from its source, to the point of confluence, is evidently the most distantly derived of all the branches of the Ganges; for if the course of the latter be measured upwards from Deoprag to the source of the Jahnuvi, its length will be found to exceed the distance from the same point to the source of the Doulee. It must, therefore, be admitted that the Jahnuvi is the real origin of that great river, notwithstanding the rival claims of the Doulee.\n\nJAINKEEPOR, in the British district of Allahabad, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a village on the route by the Rajpoor ferry from the cantonment of Allahabad to Banda, and 21 miles W. of the former.

It has a bazar, but does not seem of any great importance, not being mentioned by Lord Valen-tia,\u00b3 Skinner,\u2074 or Lumsden,\u2075 in their voyages down the river. In the time of Baber, it was perhaps more considerable; that sovereign, in his Memoirs, mentions that in one of his campaigns against the Afghans, they attempted to make a stand here, but were routed\u2076 by his son Humaiun. It is the Jaujes-mow of Rennell's Index. Distant\u2077 N.W. from Calcutta 620 miles by land, and by water 949, or, going by the Sunderbund passage, 1,125.

It was estimated in 1832 to have an area of 1,480 square miles, and to comprise 518 villages. Since that period, the limits of the district have been extended, by the addition of some pergunnahs from the adjacent state of Jhansee, ceded to the British government, and also of a confiscated jaghire called Chirgong. According to more recent returns, the area of the district thus increased is 1,873 square miles; but it is necessary to remark, that while, in respect of that portion which constituted the original district, the details are founded on the results of a professional survey, conducted by British authorities, those relating to the ceded pergunnahs and to Chirgong are taken from the canoongoe and putwarree records; those parts of the present district having been acquired by the British government subsequently to the completion of the survey.\n\nThe annexed table of population, which is restricted to the pergunnahs constituting Jaloun proper, is founded on a regularly-conducted investigation.\n\nHindoo\u2014\n\nAgricultural .................................. 92,439\nNon-agricultural ................................ 72,477\n\nMahomedan and others not Hindoo\u2014\n\nAgricultural .................................. 8,068\nNon-agricultural ................................ 8,318\n\nTotal ........................................... 176,297\n\nA rough census of the population of the Jhansee ceded pergunnahs and Chirgong affords an amount of 70,000. This being incorporated with the total of the last table, gives the following result:\n\nPopulation of original district ............ 176,297\nDitto of recent addition ..................... 70,000\n\nTotal of present district .................... 246,297\n\nIt is represented, however, that the population is increasing, and that cultivation is steadily advancing at a rate which in a\nfew years will leave no more cultivable land untilled within the district, than must of necessity be left fallow.\n\nThe district of Jaloun came into the possession\\(^5\\) of the Peishwa early in the eighteenth century, and the management of it was committed to one of his servants. Under the series of arrangements effected with the Peishwa in 1802 and 1803, the sovereign rights of that prince over Jaloun were transferred\\(^6\\) to the East-India Company. The administrator, Nana Govind Rao, of Calpee, subsequently took up arms against his new lords; but the dispute was brought to an immediate conclusion. In 1817, the British government, by a new engagement, constituted the Nana \"hereditary ruler of the lands then in his actual possession.\" In 1832\\(^7\\) the principality passed to a child only six years of age, who was placed under the guardianship of the widow of the former chief. The regent, however, who was herself but a child, being at the time not more than thirteen or fourteen years of age, proved quite unequal to the duty of controlling the refractory spirits in the district. A strong party was formed adverse to her authority; the country became disorganized, the government was involved in debt, and portion after portion of the territory mortgaged to talookars, until at length the regent and her minister, finding the credit of the government at an end, applied to the British agent for his guarantee of a further loan, declaring their inability to carry on the government without it, and exhibiting a statement of revenues and expenses, which showed an annual deficit of two and a half lacs of rupees. In these circumstances, it was deemed necessary that the British government should assume the temporary management of the country, for the purpose of reducing the expenditure, paying off the debt, resuming the mortgaged territory, and restoring order. This step was accordingly taken in 1838.\\(^8\\) The organization of a local military force\\(^*\\) being indispensable, to supersede the undisciplined and disorderly troops previously retained, the formation of a legion was authorized, composed of cavalry, infantry, and a\n\n\\* This force was subsequently increased in strength, and named the Bundlecund legion, when its sphere of duties was extended. The purposes for which it was organized having been effected, it was in 1846 disbanded, and the native officers and privates transferred to the regular army.\ngun establishment, with two European officers, as commanding officer and adjutant. Under the British administration, many beneficial changes were effected; cultivation was extended, and the country manifested unequivocal proofs of being in a state of gradual improvement. The infant chief did not live to the period when the propriety of committing the administration of the country to his charge could become a subject of discussion. He died during his minority, and no one surviving of the family of Nana Govind Rao entitled to claim the succession under the engagement by which that chief was constituted hereditary ruler of the district, it lapsed, as a matter of course, to the East-India Company as paramount lord. Since the lapse, the indications of progressive improvement have continued to be satisfactory. A revenue settlement for a term of years was made in 1849.\n\nJALOUN. \u2014 A town of Bundelcund, situate 15 miles S.W. of the right bank of the Jumna.

The immediate site of the cantonment is a gently-sloping declivity, in front of which, a small range of hills, from one to two miles distant, form a sort of amphitheatre. The lines extend from south-east to north-west, the cavalry lines being at the south-eastern extremity, those of the infantry in the middle, and those of the horse and foot artillery at the north-west. Behind those lines are the officers' quarters, well built, and situate within spacious compounds or inclosures, having good gardens, outhouses, and stabling attached to them. The cantonment is capable of affording accommodation for one troop of horse-artillery, one regiment of native cavalry, and three regiments of native infantry; having barracks, hospitals, and storerooms. They were built in 1827. A place of worship has also been erected for the Roman\\(^3\\) Catholic soldiers at this station. The climate is admirably adapted for the purposes of horticulture; in the cool season, abundance of excellent European vegetables are raised: peas, beans, cabbages, carrots, parsnips, turnips, celery, cauliflowers, and potatoes; besides many common in India. Figs, grapes, peaches, and strawberries, are also produced; the latter of extraordinary size, but somewhat deficient in flavour.

The surface throughout is rugged and mountainous, rising to the middle from the Tons on the west, and the Jumna on the east, and discharging from the elevated and central part numerous small streams into those rivers. Some of the summits are lofty; as Bairat, having an elevation of 7,559 feet; Bhadraj, of 6,043; and Baila, 6,318. The elevation diminishes generally, though irregularly, to the southern frontier, where, at Haripur, at the confluence of the Tons and Jumna, it is reduced to 1,6862 feet above the sea.\n\nThe number of townships within this district is 414. In regard to the population, the returns are less to be depended upon than those from more settled districts. They are the result of a rough census taken in 1847, by means of native agency; but they are believed by the superintendent of the district to be not far from the truth. The following are the particulars:\n\n| Hindoo          | Agricultural | 24,515 |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------|\n|                 | Non-agricultural | 145    |\n| Mahomedans and others not Hindoo | Agricultural | \u2014      |\n|                 | Non-agricultural | 24     |\n\n24,684\n\nShowing an average of rather more than forty-two persons to the square mile.

It lies on the route from Calpee to Jubbulpoor,\u00b2 72 miles S. of the former, 197 N. of the latter, and is situate on the western side of an extensive jhil or mere. Here is a bazar. The territory, of which this town is the principal place, \"comprises\u00b3 165 square miles, and is stated to contain 150 villages, with a population of 16,000 souls, and to yield a revenue of 60,000 rupees: it maintains a force of sixty horse and 300 foot.\" In 1812, the British government granted the state to Rajah Kesree Singh, a descendant\u2074 of Chuttur Sal, the founder of the independence of Bundelcund. In 1842, the rajah becoming refractory and committing depredations against the British possessions, was deposed, and the raj was granted to another descendant of Chuttur Sal, named Khet Singh, who had a few years before submitted a claim, apparently well grounded, to the raj of\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C.

Lat. 27\u00b0 46', long. 79\u00b0 50'.\n\nJELALPOOR.\u2014A town in the Punjab, on the right or western bank of the Jhelum, situate in a narrow valley of great fertility, extending between the river and the eastern extremity of the Kala, or Salt range. According to Elphinstone, this was the scene of Alexander's battle with Porus; but Burnes thinks it must have been at Jhelum, higher up, where the river, according to him, is fordable at all times except in the monsoon; but where H\u00fcgel found it, at the beginning of January, when lowest, a great stream, larger than the Indus at Attock, and bridged with twenty large boats. It is therefore doubtful whether the river could at that point be forded at the season of inundation (when, as Arrian informs us, it was crossed by Alexander); and where, indeed, the British army lost eleven men in fording it in December, which is the low season. It is, however, said that all the fords in the Punjab are more or less zigzag, and are also subject to variations, not only from season to season, but even from day to day. Jelalpoor is one of the great passages over the Jhelum, on the route from Hindostan to Afghanistan.

It is situate on the left or east bank of the Soobaureka river, here a considerable stream, yet fordable during spring, but at other seasons crossed by ferry. Here is an antique mosque, and on the opposite bank of the river is a ruined fortress of great extent, but very rude construction, being merely an inclosure, formed by a ditch and mud rampart, surmounted formerly by a dense prickly hedge, scarcely passable, except during the dry season in spring, when it could be easily fired. Jallesur is in lat. 21\u00b0 46', long. 87\u00b0 14'.\n\nJELLINGHEE, in the British district of Moorshedabad, presidency of Bengal, a town situate at the point where the river Jellinghee parts from the Pudda, or great eastern branch of the Ganges.

It holds a course very sinuous, but generally S.W., for about ninety-five miles, and, at the town of Nuddea, in lat. 23\u00b0 25', long. 88\u00b0 22', joins the Bhagruttee, another great offset of the Ganges, the united stream being designated the Hooghly. Of the three rivers, the Bhagruttee, the Martabhanga, and the Jellinghee, forming the direct channels of navigation between Calcutta and the North-West Provinces, the last is by much the deepest and most important, retaining two feet of water during the dry season in spring, when the others have an average depth of about one foot.\n\n* Originally Jaleswara.\nStill it cannot at that period be navigated by the craft usual in the Ganges, and they must then proceed through the Soon-derbund passage, and thus incur a delay of a week in reaching their destination.\n\nJELLY PUTTY.\u2014A town in the British district of Coim-batoor, presidency of Madras, 38 miles E. by N. of Dara-pooram.

It is situate near the left bank of the Indus, the water of which of late years has in this part of the course been directed to the right or west side, so that the former bank on the east side now bears the appearance of a low brow or continuous eminence, running in some degree parallel to the main channel, and seven or eight miles distant from it. Elphinstone\\(^2\\) well describes this part of the country:\u2014\"It is a narrow tract, contested between the river and the desert. If in hunting we were led many miles to the west of the road, we got into branches of the river and troublesome quicksands, among thickets of tamarisk or of reeds; and if we went as far to the right, the appearance of sand, and even in some places of sand-hills, admonished us of the neighbourhood of the desert.\" The fertile patches of ground, which are of frequent occurrence, are remarkably well cultivated, and produce grain, cotton, tobacco,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) E.I.C.

We were told they were meant to take refuge in during the inundation, when the country, for twenty miles from the banks, was under water.\" The people, he adds, were remarkably civil and well-behaved, personable, well clad, and altogether of thriving appearance. Jesool is in lat. $30^\\circ 49'$, long. $71^\\circ 2'$.\n\nJESSORE. \u2014 A British district under the presidency of Bengal, named from its principal place. It is bounded on the north-east by the British district of Pubna; on the east by those of Dacca-Jelalpore and Backergunge; on the south by the Soonderbunds; and on the west by the British districts of Baraset and Nuddea. It lies between lat. $22^\\circ 28'$\u2014$23^\\circ 46'$, long. $88^\\circ 44'$\u2014$89^\\circ 55'$; is 105 miles in length from south-east to north-west, and forty-eight in breadth. The area, according to official statement, is 3,512 square miles. The surface is, with scarcely any exception, level and depressed, and its appearance tame, uninteresting, and unvaried, except by the interchange of dry ground and swamp; this district having redundant moisture, being traversed by numerous streams, and many offsets from the Ganges, in their course from north to south, from the great parent stream to various estuaries in the Soonderbunds. The Matabhanga, a large offset from the Ganges, arrives at the north-west corner of the district, in lat. $28^\\circ 44'$, long. $88^\\circ 50'$, shortly before which it divaricates into two branches; the Koomar taking a south-easterly direction; the main stream turning south-west, and retaining the name of Matabhanga. The latter holds a sinuous course for about thirty-five miles, to Sooltanpore, where, throwing off the Boorub, it quits the frontier of Jessore. The Boorub, flowing generally south, but with much sinuosity, continues to form the western boundary between this district and the British district Nuddea for about sixty miles, as far as Hazarakhana, in lat. $23^\\circ 20'$, long. $88^\\circ 55'$, where it divides; one branch, called the Kubbuduk, proceeding south, and for fifty miles forming\nJESSORE.\n\nthe boundary between this district and that of Nuddea, to lat. 22\u00b0 52', long. 89\u00b0 10'; and beyond that point meandering, generally in a southerly direction, between this district and that of Baraset, for about seventy miles, and finally, in lat. 22\u00b0 20', long. 89\u00b0 17', passing into the Soonderbunds. The other, or left branch of the Boorub, retains that name, and takes a course south-east for about ninety miles, passing by the town of Jessore, to Hahatti, in lat. 22\u00b0 36', long. 89\u00b0 50', where it crosses the eastern frontier into the British district of Backergunge. The Matabhanga, before throwing off the Boorub, gives outlet on its left side, at Chudanga, in lat. 23\u00b0 40', long. 88\u00b0 51', to the Nabaganga, which, flowing sinuously, but generally in a south-easterly direction, for ninety miles, to Khulna, in lat. 28\u00b0 15', long. 89\u00b0 50', there joins the Barashee, a large offset from the Ganges. About ten miles below the divergence of the Nabaganga, and on the same side, the Chitrah is thrown off, which holds a course south-east for about 120 miles, and at Alipore, in lat. 22\u00b0 47', long. 89\u00b0 42', joins the Boorub. The Koomar, from its divergence from the Matabhanga, at the north-east corner of the district, forms its north-eastern boundary for about fifty-five miles, towards the British district of Pubna, as far as its confluence with the Gorae, at Mossundpur, in lat. 23\u00b0 33', long. 89\u00b0 33', below which point it is called the Barashee, and, flowing south-east for about ninety miles, forms the boundary between this district and those of Dacca-Jelalpore and Backergunge, and is ultimately lost in the Soonderbunds. Of these rivers, the Koomar and Barashee are navigable throughout the year, the others only during the inundations caused by the periodical rains of closing summer and autumn, when innumerable cross-streams cause communications between the larger channels, intersecting the country in every direction, and in many parts laying it extensively under water. The climate is bad, the air being tainted with pestilential exhalations from the muddy and weedy tanks and watercourses: hence fevers and ague, severe and often fatal, are rife at all times of the year, but especially in autumn and the close of summer, when the temperature is sometimes above 100\u00b0. It December and January it is sometimes at night as low as 55\u00b0. So fatal are the epidemics in the\n\n---\n\n* Bengal and Agra Guide, 1841, vol. ii. part i. 308.\nseason during which they prevail, that whole villages are often depopulated.\n\nThe zoology of the district, though very inadequately explored or described, is rich and interesting. It comprises, of wild beasts, the tiger, leopard, panther, bear, jackal, fox, ichneumon, wild deer, swine, and porcupine. Of domestic beasts, kine, sheep, goats, ponies, buffaloes, and hogs. Alligators in great numbers infest the waters. Birds are very numerous: the most noticeable are, the eagle, vulture, hawk, crane, goose, duck, partridge, quail, and pigeon. The botany is very comprehensive and varied, but has received little attention. From the exclusively alluvial character of the country, it contains no minerals; but salt is obtained from the southern frontier. The soil is generally very fertile; in the northern part, however, having considerable admixture of sand and clay. In the south, it comprises a larger proportion of rich alluvial earth or vegetable mould, abundantly productive of rice, indigo, oil-seeds of various kinds, sugar, tobacco, cocoanuts, areca-nuts, gram (Cicer arietinum), rye, pulse, hemp, turmeric, and fruits of various kinds. Mulberry-trees have latterly been planted in great numbers, for feeding silkworms. Indigo is largely exported, as also is rice.\n\nThe production and export of sugar and rum have latterly been greatly on the increase, large quantities being prepared by inspissating the sap of the palm-tree. The other principal exports are silk, oils, cocoanuts, areca-nuts, betel-leaf, saltpetre, and hides. The imports are cloths, metals, and manufactured hardwares, paper, spices, wheat, and shawls. The population, according to official statement, is 381,744. According to a recent authority, the Brahminists form one-half of the population, the Mussulmans the other; but this unusually large proportion of Mussulmans appears remarkable in a tract so remote* from the seat of their former empire in India. Jessore, the principal place, and the other towns, Khulna and Muhammudpur, are noticed under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThere are four roads or routes in the district:\u20141. From\n\n* Hamilton gives a still larger relative amount of Mussulmans to Brahminists; being as nine to seven.\n\n\u2020 Gazetteer, ii. 38.\nJESSORE.\n\nsouth-west to north-east, from Calcutta, through the town of Jessore, to Dacca; 2. from north to south, from Pubna, through the town of Jessore, to Murzanugur, on the south-west frontier of the district; 3. from south-east to north-west, from Habatti, on the south-eastern frontier, through the town of Jessore, to Kishnuggur; 4. from east to west, from Babukali to Kishnuggur. They are, however, but indifferent, being merely adapted for postal purposes, and impracticable for the march of troops. During the periodical rains, they are totally impassable, and even during the dry season, scarcely distinguishable from the fields which they traverse.\n\nJESSORE.\u2014The principal place of the British district of the same name, presidency of Bengal, on the route by Baraset from Calcutta to Dacca, 77 miles N.E. of Calcutta, 103 S.W. of Dacca. The civil establishment of the district is located here, and consists of a civil and session judge, a collector, a magistrate, two assistants to the magistrate and collector, an uncovented deputy-collector, a deputy-magistrate, an assistant-surgeon, a superintendent of the salt department; besides a number of native judicial and revenue functionaries. The jail at this place is a spacious building, capable of holding in safe custody 1,000 persons. Here is a school, the house for accommodating which is a fine building, the cost of erecting it having been defrayed by subscription of the zemindars of the district. The establishment consists of four members, a secretary, a head-master, an assistant, and two pundits or native teachers. The number of pupils is about 120, who are instructed in English, Persian, and Bengalee. The school was first opened in 1838. This place was formerly reputed an unhealthy station; but within the last few years considerable pains have been taken, and expense incurred, with a view to sanitary improvement; and happily with success. Jeasore is in lat. 23\u00b0 10', long. 89\u00b0 10'.\n\nJESSULMERE, the most western of the fourteen states of Rajwara or Rajpootana, is bounded on the north by\n\n* According to Tod, \"it is termed Mer in the traditional nomenclature of this region, from being a rocky (Mer) oasis in the heart of the sandy desert.\"\n\n\u2020 Now increased to fifteen, by the distribution of the territory of Kotah into two separate principalities (Kotah and Jhallawur).\nthe territory of Bahawulpoor; on the north-east by the territory of Bikaneer; on the south-east and south by that of Joudpore; and on the west by Sinde. This state was formerly much larger, extending to the Indus and Ghara, till the territory of Bahawulpoor was wrested from it by the Daudpootras. It now contains an area of 12,252 square miles. It lies between lat. 26\u00b0 8\u2032\u201428\u00b0 28\u2032, long. 70\u00b0 3\u2032\u201472\u00b0 51\u2032.\n\nAccording to Tod, a line drawn in a north-west direction from Lowarki, in lat. 27\u00b0 5\u2032, long. 71\u00b0 50\u2032, to Kharreh, lat. 27\u00b0 27\u2032, long. 70\u00b0 14\u2032, would divide the territory of Jessulmere into two nearly equal parts, the southern of which is in many places rocky, being traversed by a ridge of hills, which may be considered continuous with the high lands of Cutch. \u201cSometimes it assumes, as at Chohtun, the character of a mountain, then dwindles into an insignificant ridge, scarcely discernible, and often serves as a bulwark for the drifting sands, which cover and render it difficult to trace it at all. As it reaches the Jessulmere country, it is more developed; and at the capital, erected on a peak about 250 feet high, its presence is more distinct, and its character defined. The capital of the Bhattis (town of Jessulmere) appears as the nucleus of a series of ridges which diverge from it in all directions for the space of fifteen miles. One branch terminates at Ramghur, thirty-five miles north-west of Jessulmere; another branch extends easterly to Pokuru (in Joudpore), and thence, in a northerly direction, to Filodi, from whence at intervals it is traceable to Gurriala, nearly fifty miles due north.\u201d These barren ridges, and the lofty undulating teebas (hills) of sand, are the only objects which diversify the almost uniform sterility of these regions. No trees interpose their verdant foliage to relieve the eye or shelter the exhausted frame of the traveller. It is nearly a boundless waste, varied only by a few stunted shrubs of acacia or mimosa family, some succulent plants or prickly grapes, as the bhoorut or burr.\u201d\n\nMacmurdo, however, draws a less repulsive picture of this tract, representing it as abounding with patches of good pasture among the rocks and sandhills, and feeding great herds of cattle. The forma-\n\n* This varied expanse of rock, sand, and scanty scraps of cultivable soil, is called Thul; according to Tod, from Sthali, \u201carid or dry land,\u201d which, in the corrupted dialect of those countries, becomes \u201cthul.\u201d\nJESSULMERE.\n\ntion of the rocky ridges, consisting of sandstone, secondary limestone, and flint, is obviously similar to that of the range which crosses Upper Sinde from the eastern frontier to Boree, where a low summit insulated by the Indus is the site of the celebrated fortress of Bukkur. North of the line of demarcation already mentioned, the country is more barren, and so uniform that travellers hold their way by the guidance of the heavenly bodies. Boileau, who traversed the Great Desert, as this tract is called, thus describes it:\u2014\"Long and lofty ridges of sandhills follow each other in ceaseless succession, as if an ocean of sand had been suddenly arrested in its progress, with intervals of a quarter of a mile, or even more, between its gigantic billows; for, after ascending many hundred yards along a gradual slope, we would come suddenly to a steep descent, when our path lay across the line of waves; and on other occasions we would, perhaps, move parallel to them, with a steep wall of sand on one hand and a gentle rise on the other. In other parts of the desert, however, the main features of the scene are much less distinctly marked.\" \"Where the sand has become fairly settled, it is overrun with a considerable growth of grass and shrubs, which tend still more to bind the soil; and it seems probable, that in course of time a considerable portion of this vast wilderness will become habitable.\"\n\nThere are no running streams in the territory of Jessulmere, the periodical rains producing merely temporary sars or lakes of salt-water, formed by damming up the streams running down from the sandhills and intervening gulleys. The sars in general last but a few months, though, after very heavy monsoons, some have been known to continue through the year. The largest is the Kanod Sar, in lat. 27\u00b0 5', long. 71\u00b0 15', so called from the town of Kanod, on its southern border. It is about eighteen miles in length when fullest, and retains some water throughout the whole year. When filled to the greatest extent, a small stream proceeds from its eastern side, and, after a course of about thirty miles in an easterly direction, is lost in the sands of Joudpore. Salt is obtained from the ground left dry in the shrunken state of the lake; and this is a source of revenue to the rawul or sovereign. Water in Jessulmere is at so great a depth below the surface, that wells in some\nplaces must be dug above 300 feet* before a steady supply can be obtained. Thus, at Dihatra, on the north-west frontier, the wells are 309 feet deep; at the town of Jessulmere, 304 feet. To provide a sufficiency of that which is everywhere one of the first necessaries of life, but in warm countries pre-eminently so, the natives dig extensive tanks, which, being filled by the periodical rains, supply water during the greater part of the year; but when those supplies fail, which sometimes occurs, many human beings and cattle perish from thirst.\n\nJessulmere is devoid of valuable minerals, but limestone\u2020 is abundant, and of good quality.\n\nThe cold is considerable in winter, especially in the north and on the Bikaneer frontier, as experienced by Boileau, who mentions \"the thermometer frequently falling below 40\u00b0 in the tents at daybreak, during the month of January, 1835;\" and also, that \"on the 7th February it was down to 32\u00b0, with a good deal of frost, so that ice was formed in considerable quantities on the ponds, and different vessels of water in the camp were completely frozen.\" Such severe cold seems inexplicable in a latitude not far removed from the tropic, and having an elevation not exceeding 500 or 600 feet above the sea. As the season advances, however, the heat rapidly increases, as appears from the following facts recorded by the author above quoted.\u2021 \"On the 4th of March, 1835, the thermometer at 2 30 P.M. stood at 106\u00bd\u00b0 in my tent, and 119\u00b0 in the sun; on the 5th March, at 8 P.M., it stood at 107\u00b0 in the tent, and 117\u00b0 in the sun in the same place.\" The same author describes the heat later in the season as still higher. \"In the month of\n\n* Tod mentions some above 500 feet deep; but he is not indisposed to make the most of his material.\n\n\u2020 Boileau states that \"the limestone of Jessulmere has been applied to the purposes of lithography, and highly approved of, being considered fully equal, or even superior, to the Bavarian stone, for all transfer-work, as it will give off a very considerable number of impressions without running rotten, but its yellow colour is too deep to allow of its being used for chalk-work, as the artist cannot well distinguish the different shades of his pencil upon the stone. It has been employed largely in the royal buildings of the emperors at Agra, by the name of Sung-Kuthoo.\"\n\n\u2021 The statement appears to apply more especially to Bikaneer; but the neighbouring countries, Jussulmere, Joudpore, and Shekawattee, partake in a great degree of the same character of climate.\nJESSULMERE.\n\nMay, before the setting in of the rains, the heat is certainly awful in and near the desert; the thermometer on the table in my tent being, on the 8th May, 118\u00b0 at noon, 119\u00b0 at half-past 12, and 117\u00b0 at 3 p.m.; on the 9th, it was 120\u00b0 at noon, 123\u00b0 at 1 p.m., 119\u00b0 at 2 p.m., and 116\u00b0 at 3 p.m., in the same situation. Yet, notwithstanding this fearfully high temperature, the summer seems to be by no means an unhealthy season, and we had scarcely a single sick man in the camp, which was attributable chiefly to the dryness of the air.*\n\nJessulmere is under the influence of the south-west monsoon, so that there is an abundant fall of rain during the months of June, July, and August.* But, notwithstanding this, the air is generally dry; in consequence of which, and of the sandy nature of the soil, the country is, as Boileau found it, very healthy; and, according to a native proverb, neither mud, musquitoes, nor malaria, are found in it.\n\nThe zoology of Jessulmere appears to be neither varied nor important. A few lions are said to haunt the wilds about the southern frontier, and wild hogs are numerous in the same region. Tigers and leopards occur but rarely; wolves\u2020 and jackals are more common. There are a few antelopes, deer, and nylgaus* (Antilope picta). Snakes are so numerous that the people wear leggings of leather as a defence against them. But, in general, little amount or variety of animal life could be expected in a country so barren and of such limited extent. Domestic cattle are numerous and valuable. They consist principally of dromedaries, horses, kine, and sheep; of which last large flocks are kept, and the price is so low, that three may be bought for about four shillings.\n\nThe wild vegetation comprises phog, a tough green bush, the branches of which terminate in broomy leafless cusps; lana, a shrub about a yard high, and yielding useful provender for camels; dholirukri, or \u201cthe white shrub,\u201d a small bush about a foot and a half high, overspreading the ground in some tracts; buna, an aromatic, slender, tough-stemmed shrub, about a yard high, which in some sandy tracts overruns many hundred acres together; chug, a green shrub resembling broom, about two feet high, and making good thatch, and for which it is extensively used. The trees are generally stunted: they are the\n\n* Nilgaw, or \u201cblue cow.\u201d\nJESSULMERE.\n\nbabul (Mimosa), janth, the kurit (Capparis aphylla), the pilu. But one crop is raised in the year, the cultivation consisting in little else than scratching the ground with a small light plough, and scattering the seed in the way of broadcast. As, from the want of streams or large bodies of water, and the depth of the wells, artificial irrigation is impracticable, the weight of the crop depends entirely on adequate falls of rain. The principal crop is bajra or millet; in the more fertile parts, various sorts of pulse are cultivated.\n\nThe only manufacture of any importance in Jessulmere is that of woollens, of both coarse and fine fabrics, made from the produce of the numerous native flocks. The coarsest part of the wool is made into cordage of various kinds; the next quality into blankets, and the finest into excellent woollen cloths and fabrics.\n\nThe commerce of Jessulmere consists, for the most part, of the transit-trade between Marwar and Western Hindostan on the one hand, and Sinde and Afghanistan on the other. In consequence of the activity of this commerce, Western Rajpootana is well supplied with goods, even from remote parts. Boileau found there Delhi scarfs, ivory toys from Herat, China ware, English cutlery and firearms, glass of American manufacture, opium from Malwa, copper, gold thread, silk, piece-goods, sugar from Hindostan, and salt from the Punjab. Opium is by far the most important article of the transit-trade, and the carriage of it, and of the more bulky articles of corn and salt, gives employment to a considerable number of men, and to thousands of camels, which animals, in consequence of the arid, sultry, and generally sandy character of the country, are almost exclusively the beasts of burthen. In this traffic Sinde sends indigo, tamarisk dye, madder, rice, wheat, ghee or clarified butter, pulse, silk and cotton cloths, dried fruits, assafetida, saffron, turquoises, and quince seeds for dyeing; receiving, in return, sugar, sal ammoniac, corrosive sublimate, vegetable oils, tabashir (siliceous secretion from the bamboo), lac, groceries, and dates. The weights in use in Jessulmere are the seer, equal to two pounds avoirdupois, and the maund, containing forty seers. The currency consists of rupees and deorees, fourteen of which go to one paisa, and thirty-one of the latter make one rupee.\n\n3 Burnes, on the Commerce of Upper Sinde, in Reports and Papers published by E.I.C., Calcutta, 1839, sect. ii. 28.\n4 Id. op. sect. ii. 68.\n5 Leech, on Commerce of Dhawalpoor.\n6 Tod, Annals of Rajasthan, ii. 282.\n7 Boileau, ut supra, 170, 181.\nJESSULMERE.\n\nThe houses in the towns are substantially built of yellow limestone, and those of persons in good circumstances are ornamented with balconies and lattices of elaborately-carved stone.* The poor villagers are wretchedly lodged in circular huts, wattle-roofed with grass or straw, and bound round with grass ropes, to make them more secure; yet brick clay is obtainable, and fuel from the numerous jungles to bake it, as well as to burn lime from the calcareous deposits, frequent in many places. There are in various parts of the territory some buildings, probably of great antiquity, constructed of large stones, without cement, partaking of that style of architecture called by antiquaries Cyclopean: some temples in this style are supposed to have existed for eighteen centuries. In buildings thus constructed, the rooms, being overlaid with stone, are either so small that slabs, easily obtained and managed, can span them, or, if they be of larger dimensions, they are supported at intervals by pillars.\n\nThe ruler, and the influential portion of the population, are of the Bhatti tribe of Rajpoots,+ according to Tod originally from Zabulistan. They are a dissipated race, debasing and destroying their moral, intellectual, and physical powers by the excessive use of opium, which they imbibe sometimes in an infusion, sometimes by smoking, and not unfrequently till they become quite insensible.\u2020 The dress and accoutrements of a Bhatti in easy circumstances consist of a tunic of white cloth or chintz, reaching to the knee, trousers loose, and of many folds in the upper part, but tight round the ankles; round the\n\n* See account of the town of Jessulmere.\n\n+ D'Herbelot considers \"Zablistan\" to be the tract drained by the upper course of the river Helmund and its tributaries, and comprehending the western part of the Huzara or Hazareh country, and the district of Ghuznee. According to Tod, the Rajpoots are offsets of the great Scythian stock; but neither he nor any one else can give any farther account of the Scythians, than that they were nomadic ferocious savages, roaming over a part of Europe and an adjacent tract of vast extent in Asia. According to the account given by Malcolm,* \"the word Rajpoot is indisputably corrupted from Rajaputra, which in Sanscrit literally means a raja's son, but more generally one of the royal race.\" The Rajpoots would appear to be a branch of the military caste; and Malcolm says, \"We know, from concurring evidence, that all the Rajpoot tribes have their origin from Ayodhya or Oude.\"\n\n* Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale, iii. 579, in v.\n\n\u2020 Tod, ut supra, ii. 266.\n\n\u2021 Central India, ii. 338.\n\n\u00a7 Id. ii. 190.\nwaist a scarf, in which a dagger is stuck; a shield, suspended from the left shoulder by a strap of deer-skin, and a sword, girt on with a belt of the same material. The head is covered by a turban, generally of a red colour, and terminated above by a high peak. The dress of females is of red woollen cloth, very full below; and a scarf is generally worn, which is more or less costly, according to the circumstances of the wearer. All wear rings of ivory or bone on the arms, in such numbers as nearly to cover them from the shoulders to the wrists. The legs above the ankles are also adorned with silver rings; and women will deny themselves the necessaries of life to obtain the means of purchasing these ornaments.\n\nThe religious strictness of the Bhatti Rajpoots is rather relaxed, in consequence of their continual intercourse with the Mussulmans to the westward. The next class in number and importance to the Rajpoots are the Palliwals, a Brahminical tribe, who nearly engross the commercial business of the community, and the Pokurna tribe, also Brahminical, and exclusively devoted to rural pursuits, which are also followed by the Jat tribe, who constitute a considerable portion of the population. There are also a few Jains. The population is estimated at 74,400.\n\nUnlike many other dialects of India, that of the Bhattis of Jessulmere has no admixture of Persian, that language being nearly unknown there. Their language closely resembles the Marwari, a dialect spoken in Joudpore, Bikaneer, and the neighbouring parts of Rajpootana. The Rawul, and principal people, write in a kind of Nagari character, which, though in some degree differing from the Devanagari, could, with little practice, be fluently read by a Hindoo scholar. The citizens of Jessulmere appear to favour learning, and about 1,000 young persons are in course of education there, some by Brahmans, some by other instructors. A short time since, an English schoolmaster formed part of the domestic establishment of the Rawul.\n\nThe sovereign has an annual revenue of about 8,500l., of which about one-half is from transit-duties, the remainder from khalsa or crown lands, and miscellaneous sources. The military force maintained by the state does not exceed 1,000 men; but Tod states that, if on good terms with his thakoors or vassals,\nJESSULMERE.\n\nthe chief could muster 5,000 infantry, 1,000 horse, and a camel corps.\n\nThe history* of Jessulmere is little else than an apocryphal subject for antiquarian research, previously to 1808, when the Rawul, probably alarmed at the encroachments of the khan of Bahawulpur, made advances to an amicable understanding with the British government. This relation matured in 1818 into an alliance, by which Jessulmere became entitled to British protection,\u2020 and engaged to \"act in subordinate cooperation with the British government, and with submission to its supremacy.\"*\n\nThe principal places are noticed separately in the alphabetical arrangement. Boundary disputes had sprung up from time to time between this state and those of Bahawulpore and Khyrpore; the differences with the latter originating in the cession to Jessulmere, after the conquest of Sinde, of a portion of the desert originally belonging to Jessulmere. Under the auspices of the British government, these differences have been now adjusted, and the boundaries of Jessulmere defined both towards Khyrpore and Bahawulpore.*\n\nJESSULMERE.\u2014The capital of the Rajpoot state of the same name. It is situate in a rocky tract, described by Boileau\u2020 as \"a succession of valleys, or inclined planes, several miles long, and three or four miles broad, formed by low ridges of yellow limestone, the strata of which are not quite horizontal, but dip gently to the westward, and crop out on the eastern side, with a tolerably bold profile of ninety or 100 feet in height.\" The city is built at the base of the south end of one of these ranges, and has ramparts of unememented stone, with bastions constructed in the same way, and generally much higher than the intermediate curtains. Many of these bastions are, however, in ruins. The circuit of the ramparts is about\n\n* In Tod's Annals of Rajasthan, the \"annals of Jessulmere\" extend through seventy-three quarto pages.\n\n\u2020 Tod mentions that the British government was disgraced by affording this protection to the Rawul's minister, represented as a monster of the most atrocious character. However this may be, caution is necessary in receiving the statements of a writer who seems not to think it incredible, inasmuch as he refers to the report without comment, that the minister had been able, in twenty years, to wring from a beggarly population of 74,000 persons, not less than two crores (2,000,000l.).\ntwo miles and a quarter; the height fourteen feet, including a parapet of six feet. The thickness of the rampart is four feet, that of the parapet two; and there is neither ditch nor fausse-braie. These defences are in many places so ruined and obliterated by sand-drifts, that they may be crossed on horseback. The only piece of ordnance throughout the whole circuit is one small gun on the highest bastion, at the north-east angle. There are four regular gateways, and three sally-ports. Inclosed within the rampart, and in the south part of the town, is the citadel, situate on an insulated eminence, three-quarters of a mile in circumference, and with steep sides, scarped all round, and faced with masonry to the height of about twenty feet, above which distance the surface of the hill recedes, at an elevation of about 40\u00b0, to the foot of the renee, which, with a width of six feet, runs quite round the fort. The ramparts of the fort vary in height from fifteen to thirty feet, the top of the parapet being about 130 feet above the town. The whole of the defences, as well as the town wall, are built of the yellow limestone quarried from the rocky ridge at the base of which the town lies. The summit of the ridge commands every part of the fortifications, which could be easily breached, though the considerable angle of elevation of the side of the hill forming the site of the citadel would make it difficult to storm. The outline of the citadel is an irregular triangle; the interior is occupied by the palace and several temples and dwellings, to the number of 3,000. There is only one entrance, which is on the north side, and is defended by four successive gateways, with sloping roads between them. At the time of Boileau's visit, there were four guns mounted on the walls of the citadel, and two heavy guns, a large howitzer, and three field-pieces, drawn up near the gate. The crests of the parapets are covered with rollers and balls of stone, methodically arranged, and ready to be sent down upon an assailing force.\n\nThe palace of the Maha Rawul or sovereign, within the citadel, is a great pile of building, surmounted by a huge umbrella, made of metal, and supported by a stone shaft. This is considered an emblem of high dignity, to which no other Rajpoot prince is entitled, except the chief of Ooodeypoor. There are in the citadel, besides the palace, six temples, three\nfor those of the Jain persuasion, and three for the Brahminists. The Jain temples are of great antiquity, built of stone, elaborately carved, and surmounted by gilt spires, towering over the adjacent buildings. Within the citadel, there are eight wells, above 300 feet deep. The water which they furnish is brackish, but not to such an extent as to be undrinkable. Progress has been made in sinking a well close to the gate. The work, at the time of Boileau's visit, had proceeded to the depth of 120 feet; but a much greater depth had still to be attained before reaching the main spring.\n\nThe city contains about 8,000 houses, including those within the citadel. The domestic architecture is in many instances elaborate and solid. The house of a citizen in moderate circumstances has usually a frontage of about twenty-five feet. The basement story is painted red on the outside, and is quite plain, having one door giving access to the interior, and two or three slits instead of windows, to give light to the lumber-room, which occupies that part of the house. The upper or principal story is very neat, the front having a small projecting balcony, constructed of stone well carved, though rather in a heavy style. On each side is a latticed window about four feet square, and ornamented with framework of limestone, curiously carved. The balcony is surmounted by a massive canopy, the top of which is level with the flat roof, and being like it, provided with a balustrade or battlement of cut stone, serves as a place for the inmates of the dwelling to enjoy the fresh air and prospect. Each house is raised above the street by a terrace about four feet high and six or seven wide, and has in front of every story a stone spout, to carry off the water into the street below. In the fronts of the terrace, long blocks of stone are bedded, so as to project some distance, and these have knobs at the ends, to which cattle may be tied. The interior of the house has a court a few feet square, into which various water-spouts are discharged, and the drainage passed off into the street by the subterraneous channel. On one side of the court is the cistern, on the other, the rusora or kitchen. One or two narrow and steep staircases of stone lead from the corners of the area to the upper story and roof, where the females of the family take the air. The principal sleeping-room occupies the front side of the square. The back part of\nthe house is laid out in store-rooms, and the two sides of the square are formed into numerous small chambers, \"with a profusion of odd but convenient little nooks, and cupboards built into the thickness of the wall. Pretty cradles and beds are provided for the children; long wooden pegs neatly painted, project from the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes, and, in short, everything wears an appearance of comfort, the more pleasing, as it is quite unexpected.\"2 The most remarkable building in the town is the house of the ex-minister, a very costly structure of five stories of cut stone, with a sixth of timber, surmounted by five cupolas. There is scarcely anything like a bazar, and the only appearance of traffic is at the custom-house, near the gate of the citadel. The inhabitants of the town are supplied with water from a large tank, 300 yards south-east of the city; and near its banks are several small pits, which collect water from the drainage of the surface, but are not sufficiently deep to reach the springs. Close outside the western gate of the city are two wells, 241 feet deep, with water slightly brackish. They are protected from falling into the hands of an enemy by parapets with loopholes.\n\nAccording to Tod,3 Jessulmere was founded in 1156, by Jesul, a Bhatti prince, to replace the more ancient capital, Lodorva, situate 10 miles N.W. of the present. The site of Lodorva had no natural difficulties which might aid its defence, and in consequence of its exposed situation, was sacked by a hostile force; whereupon, the surviving inhabitants settled at Jessulmere. The population of Jessulmere is probably about 35,000.4 It is distant N.W. from Calcutta, by Allahabad, Calpeo, Gwalior, and Nusseerabad, 1,2905 miles.

The name Jewala Muki is composed of two Sanscrit words,\u2014Jewala, flame, and Muki, mouth. The flame, according to the legend, proceeds from the fire which Sati, the bride of Siva, created, and in which she burned herself. Siva, finding that this flame was about to consume the world, buried it in the hollow of the mountain. The temple is about twenty feet square, and the principal place of flame is a shallow trough, excavated in the floor, where it blazes without intermission. There are several jets of less importance. The gas also lies on the surface of some small reservoirs of water, and, when ignited, continues to burn for a short time. The roof of the temple is richly gilt, but the interior is blackened by the smoke of burned butter, sugar, and other gross offerings. In 1839, Runjeet Singh, when ill, made an offering of butter to the amount of 1,500l., hoping the renovation of his health from the favour of the deity. The weight of the offering was probably about sixty or seventy tons; and Vigne, who was at the place while the burning was going forward, found \"the stench similar to that of a candlemaker's shop.\" Near the principal temple is one smaller, called Gogranath, and hence concluded by Von H\u00fcgel to be of Buddhist origin. The ground adjoining to the group of sacred buildings is crowded with cows, Brahmans, pilgrims, and mendicants, and loaded with filth. The pilgrims, most of whom are paupers, are supported for one day from the funds of the temple. The town is dirty and neglected, but has an extensive bazar, containing great quantities of idols, votive garlands, rosaries, and other trumpery of the like description. The population is about 3,000. Near the town is a mineral spring, the water of which is found to be singularly\nefficacious in discussing bronchocele. Moorcroft was unable to analyze this water; but it probably contains some form of iodine, now known to possess much efficacy in resolving glandular tumours.

This state, called anciently Amber, lies between lat. 25\u00b0 40'\u201427\u00b0 37', long. 75\u00b0 8'\u201477\u00b0 20'; is about 150 miles in length from east to west, and 140 in breadth; having an area of 15,251\u00b2 square miles. It in general is an extensive plain,\u00b3 though in the northern and north-western parts are \"insulated peaks,\"\u2074 and clusters of dentated hills, here and there rising above the general level.\" They may be regarded as connected with a similar formation\u2075 in the vicinity of Delhi. Jacquemont\u2076 estimates their average elevation above the plain at about 300 feet. Their geological formation\u2077 is quartz and granitoid rock, intermixed with white calcareous rock or marble, and occasionally mica. The country extending south of those hills is generally a level expanse of fine white sand, nearly devoid of vegetation, except where moistened by a spring or perennial rill, either of which is of very rare occurrence. This plain is bounded to the south-east by a rocky range of small\u2078 height, running from north-east to south-west, immediately to the west of the city of Jeypoor. The range is continued in a north-eastern direction\u2079 until it joins the mountains of Alwar. The southern part of the territory is, with little exception, a sandy\u2079 plain, studded in some places with low rocky hills, cultivable only by means of the incessant irrigation applied to it.\n\n* Jaipur of Jaisingh;\u00b9 Jeypour and Jaepour of Rennell.\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C.

Many parts are irreclaimably barren. Heber says, \"The country resembled extremely a large estuary, but studded with rocky islands, whose sands were left bare by the receding tide. Except the few thorny shrubs I mentioned, which do not grow higher than the common heather, not a blade of verdure was to be seen.\" A large portion of the soil is employed in grazing, and cattle are very numerous. Those parts of the territory which admit of cultivation, produce great crops of grain, pulse, cotton, and tobacco. Everywhere occur traces of extensive cultivation and prosperity, swept away by the devastating wars in the latter part of the last century and the early part of the present; a natural consequence of such events, as thorough tranquillity and safety for life and property are indispensable for the due cultivation of a tract depending on irrigation from wells for the growth of vegetation. The periodical rains are light, and confined to the close of summer, and there are few perennial streams. The Banganga, the most considerable of the transient torrents which traverse the country, is in winter and spring devoid of water. There are a few springs, but the water which they afford is soon absorbed by the sands. Water, however, may be obtained at all times by digging in the beds of torrents, and in most places is met with near the surface; so that wells need not be sunk to any great depth. From the naked, arid character of the soil, the temperature, during the prevalence of the hot winds, in the latter part of spring and beginning of summer, is dreadful, the thermometer frequently rising to 130\u00b0 in the shade, and the heat proving fatal to men and beasts. In winter, however, the temperature is sometimes so low as to produce hoar frost. The population is a collection of various races, of which the most numerous are the Minas, supposed to be the aboriginal possessors of the country. Next, and nearly equal in number, are the Jats, who are extensive holders of land, and the most industrious and skilful agriculturists. Brahmins are numerous, being in greater proportion to the rest of the population than in any other state of Rajwara. Rajpoots, the ruling class, though inferior in number to the Minas and Jats, are conjectured to be still capable of mustering 30,000 men in arms.\nJEYPOOR.\n\nThey are of the Kachhwaha* or Kashwaha tribe, according to tradition, descended from Kash or Kasha, the son of Rama, and supposed to have originally come from Mount Aboo, but they are not considered equal in prowess to the Rahtors, the Haras, or some other Rajpoot\u2020 tribes. Of less important tribes, the chief are the Banias, Dhakurs, and Gujurs. Tod estimates the relative density of the population of Shekawutti at 80, and the remainder of Jeypore at 150 to the square mile, giving an average of 124 to the united area; and assuming this, the area being 15,251 miles, 1,891,124 would be the aggregate number of the inhabitants. Of the accuracy of the assumption on which this calculation is based, there are no sufficient means of judging; but it differs considerably from the view of Malcolm, who estimates the relative density of the population of Central India at ninety-eight to the square mile; which would yield an aggregate of only 1,494,598.\n\nThe revenue of Jeypoor has greatly fluctuated. It was estimated in round numbers at a crore of rupees, or a million sterling, during the most flourishing condition of the state. This was probably an exaggeration; but, however that may be, various causes combined to reduce the amount in 1802 to 81,88,000 rupees; a sum differing widely from that now realized, which, independent of feudal jaghires and charitable endowments, is returned at 45,83,960 rupees. Under a treaty concluded in April, 1818, Jeypoor became tributary to the East-India Company. For the first year no demand was to be made; for the second year the amount was fixed at four lacs of Delhi rupees; the third year at five lacs; the fourth year at six lacs; the fifth year at seven lacs. Thenceforward the annual tribute was to be eight lacs, until the revenues of the state should exceed forty lacs, when five-sixteenths of the excess was to be paid in addition to the eight lacs. In 1842, however, an arrear had accumulated amounting to no less than forty-six lacs. The whole of this was remitted, and the annual tribute fixed at four lacs.\n\n* Cachhwaha of Elliot.\n\u2020 The Kachhwaha does not occur among the thirty-six Rajpoot tribes enumerated by Chandra in his history of Prithwi Rai, the Rajpoot prince, and last Hindoo king of Delhi.\n\n1 Oriental Mag. viii.\n2 Tod, Annals of Rajasthan, ii. 451.\n3 Id. ii. 490.\n4 Central India, ii. 293.\n5 Tod, ii. 433.\n6 Treaties and Engagements, Calcutta, 1845, p. 600.\n7 Supplement to Glossary, 900.\n8 Or.

The government is vested in an hereditary rajah; and when that dignity is held by an adult of firm character and talent, he engrosses nearly all power; but, as in most Eastern states, during a minority, or the reign of an imbecile prince, the country may be regarded as partitioned among the thakoors; each then becoming nearly, if not quite, independent in his estate and fort.\n\nThe principal towns are noticed under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe principal military routes are\u20141. From north-east to south-west, from Delhi to the city of Jeypoor, and thence to Mhow; 2. from east to west, from Agra to the city of Jeypoor, and thence to Ajmere; 3. from north-east to south-west, from Agra to Neemuch; 4. from east to west, from Calpee to Neemuch.\n\nThe Kachwaha Rajpoots, who founded the state of Jeypoor, claim descent from Kush, second son of Rama, king of Ayodhya or Oude, whose reign is fixed at a very early period. After many centuries of wars and migrations, they overran the tract at present forming the state of Jeypoor, and, expelling or subjugating the Minas and Bingoogurs, founded the kingdom of Dhoondar* or Amber, in 967, under the conduct of Dhola Rae, the first rajah. In the year 1200, Alauddin, the Patan king of Delhi, stormed the celebrated fortress of Rantambor, and put its defenders to the sword. At a later period, the rajah attached himself to the fortunes of Baber, and afterwards, as rajah of Amber, received from Humayun, about the year 1582, a munsab or commission of command over 5,000 men. A subsequent rajah gave his daughter in marriage to Selim, the son of Akbar, and afterwards padshah, under the name of Jehangir. The alliance, however, proved unfortunate. Prince Khusroo, the offspring of the marriage, was hated by his father; and some circumstances in their disputes so affected\n\n* According to Tod, \"the etymology of Dhoondar is from a once celebrated sacrificial mound (d'hoond) on the western frontier.\"\nJEYPOOR.\n\nthe princess his mother, that she destroyed herself by poison. Khusroo aspired to succeed Akbar, in supersession of his father, but the attempt was unsuccessful, and he passed the rest of his days in captivity. Latterly he was intrusted to the charge of his brother Shah Jehan, another son of Jehangir, and afterwards padshah, in whose custody he died, not without suspicion of having been cut off by order of his brother. Under the reign of Arungzebe, Jey Singh, the rajah of Amber, was one of the most powerful and assiduous courtiers of that monarch, from whom he received a munsab or command of 7,000 men; and, amongst other services, he betrayed to his patron his rival brother, the rightful heir, Prince Dara. He also contrived to place in captivity Sevajee, the celebrated founder of the Mahratta sway, whom, however, he in some degree compensated by subsequently aiding in his escape. Aurungzebe becoming jealous of Jey Singh, caused him, it is said, to be poisoned. The munsab was reduced to Jey Singh's successor to 4,000 men, and to the third in succession to 3,000 men. The next prince, Jey Singh the Second, entered into the contest for the succession, which, on the death of Aurungzebe, arose among his sons. He supported the cause of Azim against his brother Moazzim; and, after the defeat and death of the former, was by the victor subjected to terms much more rigorous than were enforced on other Rajpoot princes. The course of events, however, favoured Jey Singh, and he was subsequently, it is believed, admitted to conditions not inferior to those granted to his most favoured brethren. At a later date, when Ferokshere was raised to the throne of Delhi, Jey Singh held a high command under him. When a powerful conspiracy threatened the ruin of that feeble-minded monarch, the Rajpoot steadily supported him; and having in vain urged him to resistance, on his murder retired to Amber. Jey Singh was high in favour with Mohammed Shah, successor of Ferokshere, and, on account of his great scientific attainments, was\n\n* Gladwin gives the following version of the transaction:\u2014\u201cShe inherited a melancholy disposition from her family; and the undutiful behaviour of her son in making use of every opportunity to prejudice Akbar against his father, so worked on her imagination, that, taking the opportunity of her husband\u2019s absence on an hunting-party, she destroyed herself by a large dose of opium.\u201d\n\nElphinstone, Hist. of India, ii. 272.\n\nId. ii. 440.

He also founded the city of Jeypoor, which remains a monument of his architectural skill.\n\nThe career of Mahratta conquest towards the north and northeast appears to have been at first favourable to the aggrandisement of Jeypoor, which for a time made common cause with the new race of marauders, in seizing the fragments of the falling realm of Delhi, but itself soon became a sufferer from them. Scindia demanded heavy contributions, which being resisted, that chieftain marched with a large army to enforce them. He was, however, signally defeated. The defection and subsequent independence of the chief of Macherry or Alwar, about the year 1790, rent away a large portion of the territory of Jeypoor; and Tukajee Holkar, the Mahratta chief, invading the remainder, extorted an engagement for the payment of a large annual tribute, which was afterwards transferred to Ameer Khan. From this period the country was overrun and desolated by different parties of freebooters, who often fought among themselves for the spoil, till, in 1803, a treaty was concluded between Juggut Sing, rajah of Jeypoor, and the British government, but annulled by Sir George Barlow, governor-general, in 1805, contrary to the earnest remonstrances of Lord Lake. On this occasion, the Jeypoor agent observed to the British general, that this was the first time the English government had been known to make its faith subservient to its convenience. Jeypoor was now left to the mercy of the Mahrattas, whose desolating ravages reduced the finest tracts to the state of deserts. In 1818 another treaty was concluded, by which the British government agreed to protect Jeypoor, that state engaging to acknowledge its supremacy, to yield subordinate co-operation, and to pay tribute. Some hesitation was manifested by the durbar of the Jeypoor state in receiving the overtures of the British; the existence of which was ascribed, and probably with justice, to a fear that the stronger power might, as before, break the engagement.\nJEYPOOR.\n\nwhen deemed inconvenient, leaving the weaker to the vengeance of the Mahrattas. But though saved from outrages of this kind, the country prospered not. Juggut Singh, the prince with whom the treaty was concluded, died in the same year in which it was executed. After a short interval, a posthumous son of the deceased rajah was acknowledged as his successor; and during his minority his mother assumed the regency. This authority she continued to exercise till her death, which occurred in 1831. Throughout this period, the most scandalous corruption, intrigue, and misgovernment prevailed, and shortly after the ranees's death, the British government found it necessary to move a force into Jeypoor, for the purpose of redressing the wrongs and correcting the abuses which had brought the country to a state which led to its being described by a traveller in 1835, as exhibiting \"an empty treasury, desolate palaces, stagnating commerce, a ferocious populace, and a rabble army.\" The greater part of the country was in the hands of the thakors or subordinate chiefs, each of whom possessed a military force and as many retainers as he could keep together, exercising all the powers of government within his own district. These thakors were in general engaged in quarrels and wars with each other, and frequently in combinations and contests against the ruling powers of the state, while marauders from neighbouring districts ravaged the country, sometimes even with the connivance of the rajah's minister, who closed his eyes to these outrages, and participated in the plunder. This man consummated his villanies by poisoning his master. He followed up the atrocity by attempts on the life of Major Alves, the Governor-General's agent, and his assistant, Mr. M. Blake, and against the latter was unhappily successful. It remains to be added, that the convicted contriver of these vile deeds was permitted to end his days in the fortress of Chunar, an example of lenity ill merited. The measures of the British government speedily introduced a better state of things; a regency during the minority of the infant successor of the murdered prince was appointed; financial reforms were commenced, and an approximation to at least something like the administration of justice made. The effect of the pervading influence of the British government is thus stated by Colonel Sutherland:\u2014\u201cA\nvisible improvement has taken place in the condition of the fine and modern city of Jeypore itself, and generally throughout the country, while everywhere there is a sense of security and the prevalence of order, which, the people say, have been unknown during either of the last two reigns, and which they compare with what existed in the days of Jey Sing, the founder of the city of Jeypore.\" Subsequently, opportunity was found for the exercise of the charities of life; hospitals and dispensaries were established, of the benefits of which nearly 2,000 patients availed themselves within eight months. Of this number nearly seven-eighths were discharged cured, and only five persons died under treatment. The financial results under the influence of English authority were not less happy. The government, it is needless to add, was in debt; for all Indian governments, however hopeless their credit, contrive to accumulate debt. In 1843-44, 9,39,587 rupees of the public debt was paid off, and only 3,59,545 rupees remained due. Towards this reduction, 7,82,414 rupees, derived from the discovery of treasure formerly concealed by the infamous minister of Jeypoor, was made available. In 1844-45 the revenues exceeded the disbursements by 3,88,138 rupees, and the amount of debt was reduced by 49,777 rupees, leaving a balance of 3,09,768 rupees. In 1845-46 the receipts exceeded the disbursements by 5,14,012 rupees, and the state was free from debt. In 1851 the young chief completed his eighteenth year. He had in some degree been initiated into public business, and the British authorities entertaining a favourable opinion of his general fitness for the duties of his station, he was allowed to assume the reins of government, and exhorted to continue the beneficent system of administration under which his dominions during his minority had attained so high a degree of prosperity.\n\nJEYPOOR.\u2014A large city, the principal place of the territory of Jeypoor or Amber. It is situate in a small plain, or rather basin, conjectured to be the bed of a dried-up lake, having on all sides, except the south, barren stony hills, crowned in many places with forts. On the north, the hill rises above the town several hundred feet, and on this is built the citadel, which \"has\" a very bold appearance when viewed from the town, the south face of the rocks being very pre-\ncipitous, and totally inaccessible.\" It is approachable, however, on the north, where the rock slopes gradually towards the antique town of Amber. The town of Jeypoor is about two miles in length from east to west, the breadth about one mile. It \"is entirely surrounded by a wall of masonry, with lofty towers and well-protected gateways, but the ramparts are too thin to offer an effectual resistance even to field artillery, and they are so low, that the shifting sands have in some places drifted against the outside of the wall nearly as high as the parapet, totally obliterating the ditch, if ever there was one.\" There are seven gateways, in no manner differing from each other. Outside the rampart, another wall runs parallel to it, embattled at the top, and having numerous loopholes for musketry. It is considered to be the most handsome and regularly built of the cities laid down by native Indians. A main street, two miles in length, and forty yards in breadth, extends from east to west. This is intersected by several streets of about forty yards in width, and at each point of intersection is a chauk or market-square. \"The cross-streets are in their turn intersected at right angles by narrower streets, and the latter are again subdivided in a similar manner by lanes, which are aligned with equal accuracy; so that nearly the whole city is portioned out into rectangular blocks.\" \"The palace, gardens, and royal premises, occupy the whole of the central block, being half a mile long.\" The front of the royal residence is extremely high, having seven or eight stories, and is flanked at each extremity by a lofty tower, surmounted by a cupola. Within are two spacious courts, and several of smaller dimensions, surrounded by cloisters, with stone pillars. The garden, which is surrounded by a high embattled wall, terraced at top, and cloistered below, is \"extremely beautiful, full of fountains, cypresses, palm, and flowering shrubs, with a succession of terraces and alcoves, none of them, singly taken, in good taste, but, all together, extremely rich and striking.\" Jacquemont states that there are in this vast residence fully a dozen palaces, communicating either by galleries or gardens. The most remarkable apartment is the Diwani Khas, or hall of audience, a splendid oblong room, entirely built of white marble, which material is also profusely employed throughout in the construction of the palaces. The houses in the prin-\nJEYPOOR.\n\nPrincipal streets are in general finely built of stone; and numerous mosques and temples add to the architectural splendour of the town. The arsenal contains a furnace for casting, and machinery for boring guns; but none have lately been made here. There are some antique cannon, of enormous dimensions, constructed of wrought-iron bars, laid longitudinally, and kept together by a coat of gun-metal founded around them; but they are totally unserviceable. The huge observatory, erected here by Jai Singh, is in good preservation, but no pundit of the place has skill to make use of it. \"Besides the huge dials, azimuth-circles, altitude-pillars, and such other bulky instruments, of masonry, there are some brazen altitude-circles of enormous size and great weight.\"\n\nJeypoor was built in the early part of the eighteenth century, by the celebrated Sewae Jai Singh, rajah of Dhoondar or Amber, and, having named it after himself, he hither removed his residence and court from the adjacent city of Amber, now desolate.

The area is computed at 18,041 square miles, and the population at 391,280. The tract is held by a number of chiefs, styled hill zemindars, who collectively pay an annual tribute of 16,000 rupees, or 1,600l., to the British government.\nJEY\u2014JHA.\n\nThe tribute has occasionally fallen into arrear, owing to internal dissensions, in which the British government have declined to interfere. Indeed, from the wild state of the country, access to the interior is scarcely practicable, and a further barrier is imposed, in the pestilential nature of the climate. An alleged instance of human sacrifice in this territory was some time since brought to the notice of the British government, and measures were instantly adopted for the suppression of the barbarous practice. The town of Jeypoor is in lat. 19\u00b0 1', long. 82\u00b0 27'.\n\nJEYPOOR.\u2014A town in one of the recently sequestrated districts of the native state of Hyderabad, or dominions of the Nizam, 68 miles W.S.W. of Ellichpoor.

It has water from wells, and also from a tank, and supplies are procurable from the neighbouring villages. The road in this part of the route is heavy and bad for wheeled carriages. Lat. 27\u00b0 85', long. 77\u00b0 40'.\n\nJEYTPPOOR, in the British district of Sohagpoor, territory of Saugor and Nerbudda, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a town on the route from Sohagpoor to Sasseran, 25 miles N.E. of the former. Lat. 28\u00b0 30', long. 81\u00b0 49'.\n\nJHAJPOOR,\u2021 in the Rajpoot state of Oodeypoor or Mewar, a town on the route from Nusseerabad to Saugor, 63\u00b2 miles S.E. of former, 287 N.W. of latter. It has a good bazar, and supplies and water are abundant. Here is a fortress on an isolated oblong hill, guarding the eastern entrance of an important pass\u00a7 from the lowlands of Boondee into the territory of Oodeypoor or Mewar. It is large and strong, and consists of two similar ramparts, one within the other, a considerable space intervening. Each has a good ditch and numerous round bastions. The town lies north-west of the fort, at the foot of the hill, and is large, well built, and fortified. The pergunnah of Jhajpoor, of which it is the principal place, con-\n\n* Probably the Geht of the Aysen Akbery.\n\n296\nJHA.\n\ntains 100 townships, inhabited by the indigenous tribe Mina, who muster 4,000 bowmen. Lat. 25\u00b0 40', long. 75\u00b0 21'.\n\nJHALLAWAR, in the peninsula of Kattywar, province of Guzerat, a district named from the Jhalla tribe of Rajpoots, who are the principal part of the population. It extends over the north-eastern part of the peninsula, and is bounded on the north by the Runn or Salt-marsh, connected with the eastern extremity of the Gulf of Cutch; on the east by the British district of Ahmedabad; on the south by the British district of Ahmedabad and the prant or district of Kattywar; on the south-west by the prant of Hallar; on the west by the prant of Muchockanta; and lies between lat. 22\u00b0 18'\u201423\u00b0 8', long. 70\u00b0 50'\u201472\u00b0 10'. No official return has been made of the area; but, by a probable approximation, it may be stated at 3,000 square miles. It is in general a level tract, and well watered by numerous small streams, flowing northward and eastward into the Runn. Of those streams, the most considerable is the Muchu, which, rising among the hills in the south-western part of the district, takes a direction north-west, and, passing into the prant of Muchockanta, falls into the eastern extremity of the Gulf of Cutch, near the town of Maliya. The district is in general irrigated, as water is found at a moderate depth in wells, and quite near the surface in the beds even of those streams the currents of which fail in the dry season. The staple produce of this prant is grain, especially wheat, of which a considerable quantity is exported: much cotton of excellent quality is also grown and exported. This tract is in general devoid of wood, a supply of which is obtainable only from plantations of limited extent about the villages. The district contains 496 towns or villages, a population of 240,325, and pays to the British government an annual tribute of about 27,034l. The principal towns, Waunkaneer, Hulwud, Darraungdra, Wudwan, and Limree, are noticed under their respective names in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nJHALLODE, in the territory of Scindia, a town on the route from Neemuch to Baroda, 131 miles S.W. of former, 108 N.E. of latter. It was formerly of importance, being the principal place of a pergunnah of the kingdom of Guzerat, containing seventeen towns, and it is still a considerable place.\nJHA.\n\nIt has a bazar, a mosque, a small temple, a large and fine tank, and some well-built houses of brick, two stories high, and covered with tiles. Lat. 23\u00b0 7', long. 74\u00b0 9'.\n\nJHALLOWA.\u2014A small raj, formed in the year 1838 by a division of the Rajpoot state of Kota. The circumstances which led to this division (which are of singular character) will be found detailed in the article Kota. It is divided into three separate portions, the largest of which extends from lat. 24\u00b0 6' to 24\u00b0 40', and from long. 76\u00b0 30' to 76\u00b0 58'. The area a little exceeds 2,200 square miles, and the population, according to the rate of estimate usually adopted for this part of India, would be upwards of 220,000. Upon the death of the late chief of Jhallowa, in 1848, a suttee took place; and in consequence of this violation of existing engagements, the British government withheld for a time their formal recognition of the present ruler. Precautions were subsequently taken to prevent a recurrence of the atrocious practice, and friendly intercourse between the two governments was re-established.\n\nJHALOO, in the British district of Bijnour, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a town, the principal place of the pergunnah of the same name. It has a population of 6,551, and is situate it lat. 29\u00b0 20', long. 78\u00b0 17'.\n\nJHALRA PATUN, in Rajpootana, a town in the Jhallowa division of the state of Kota, situate on the route from Nee-much to Ssugor, 90 miles E. of the former, 216 N.W. of the latter. It is a handsome and well-built town, the modern part of which was laid down by Zalim Singh, the regent of Kota, on the model of Jeypoor. The ground-plan is nearly a square, surrounded by a substantial wall and bastion, well furnished with cannon. Two main streets, running north and south, east and west, intersect each other; and from those diverge smaller streets, and others run parallel. At the point of intersection is a broad terrace, on which stands a temple ninety feet high, dedicated to Chatoorbhooja or Vishnu, represented with four arms. The main street, running north and south, and nearly a mile long, is terminated by a temple dedicated to Dwarcanath or Krishna. In another part of the city is a handsome Jain temple, of great antiquity, but recently repaired and embellished. Close to the town, on the west, is a lake or large tank, nearly a mile square, which throughout the whole year contains\na large body of water. It has been either made or enlarged by artificial means, as Zalim Singh repaired the dam at the same time that he enlarged and improved the town. He also granted a charter exempting the inhabitants from all forced contributions, forced labour, and the hardship of buying grain from government at an exorbitant and arbitrary price. The inhabitants moreover pay only one-half of the transit-duties ordinarily levied in Harouti. From these causes the town has become the grand central mart of Northern Malwa and South-eastern Rajpootana. Though brought to its present flourishing state only towards the close of the last century, it is a town of great antiquity, the oldest inscription amongst its numerous ruins bearing date 748, Samvat, corresponding to A.D. 692. Shattered temples and fallen idols strew the ground about the town, and vast numbers have been used as materials in building the present fortifications; and nothing can be more elaborate than the workmanship in the ruined fanes. The number of temples, according to tradition, was once 108; and from the pealing of their bells, this sacred city, it is alleged, was denominated.* It is also called Chandravati.

The road in this part of the route is in many places sandy and heavy; the country cut up by ravines, and ill cultivated. Lat. 27\u00b0 22', long. 77\u00b0 40'.\n\nJHANSI.\u2014A small native state in Bundelcund. It consists of two parts, lying nearly contiguous to each other, being separated only by a narrow strip of territory belonging to the native raj of Tehree. The western division is bounded on the north by Gwalior and Dutteeah; on the east by Tehree; on\n\n* According to Tod, \"Jhalra-patun, or 'the city of bells.'\" He, however, elsewhere states that the etymology is \"Jhalarapatun, the city of the Jhala;\" Zalim Singh, who rebuilt it, being of the Jhala tribe of Rajpoots. A more plausible etymology, however, appears to be from Jhalra, \"a spring of water,\" and Patun, \"town;\" the rivulet Chandrabhaga, as well as the Orzaggar, or small lake, abundantly supplying it with water.\nJHANSI.\n\nthe south and west by Gwalior. The eastern portion is bounded on the north-west by the British district of Jaloun; on the east by that of Hummeerpoor; on the south and southwest by Tehree. The combined territory lies between lat. 24\u00b0 55' and 25\u00b0 48', long. 77\u00b0 53' and 79\u00b0 31', and extends from east to west about 100 miles, and from north to south about 60. In 1832 it was estimated to have an area of 2,922 square miles, 956 villages, and a population of 286,000. Since that period, however, the limits of the district have been contracted by alienation, and consequently the above-quoted estimates do not, in respect either of extent or population, represent its present condition. Probably 390 miles should be subtracted from the area as above stated, and 86,000 persons from the population.\n\nThe tract was formerly part of the possessions of the Boondela rajah of Oorcha. Subsequently, it fell into the hands of the Peishwa, and was assigned to the administration of one of his officers in the character of soubahdar. In 1804 a treaty of defensive alliance was concluded by the British with the then soubahdar, as a tributary of the Peishwa. In 1817, consequent on the cession to the East-India Company of the Peishwa's rights in Bundelcund, a second treaty was concluded by the British government with the soubahdar of Jhansi, by which he was acknowledged \"hereditary ruler\" of the territory, subject to the payment of an annual tribute of 74,000 rupees (Jhansi currency). In 1832 he was permitted to assume the title of rajah. Ram Ramchund Rao, the ruler on whom this dignity was conferred, died in 1835, without issue. Various claimants to the succession thereupon appeared, but the British government decreed in favour of Rao Rugonath Rao, the uncle and next of kin of the deceased rajah. He died about three years after his accession; his brief period of rule having been rendered unquiet by opposition to his claim, professedly grounded on the fact of his being a leper, which was asserted to be a disqualification for the occupation of the seat of power. Rugonath Rao left no legitimate issue, and the succession became again the subject of contending claims. Some of these were obviously inadmissible, and the propriety of at once sanctioning any of them appeared very questionable, regard being had to the distracted state of the country, which\nJHANSI.\n\nhad greatly deteriorated in condition, from continued misgovern-\nment; the revenue (which is said at one period to have been\neighteen lacs of rupees) having fallen from twelve lacs, its\namount in 1832, to three lacs. Under these circumstances, it\nwas deemed advisable that the Governor-General's agent in\nBundelcund should assume the administration; the various\nclaims to the raj being reserved for future adjudication. This\nstep was accordingly taken, though not without opposition;\nthe mother of Ramchund Rao, who espoused the cause of one\nof the claimants to the succession, having compelled the British\ngovernment to make military demonstration before she would\nquit the fort of Jhansi. A commission appointed to investigate\nthe different claims, unanimously rejected all except that of\nBaba Gunghadar Rao, brother of the late chief, and the only\nsurviving male descendant of Sheo Rao Bhow, with whom, as\nsoubahdar, the first engagement of the East-India Company with\nJhansi was concluded. The selection was approved by the\nhome authorities; but the new rajah was not of strong intellect,\nand was therefore thought unequal to the task of retrieving\nthe principality from the state of disorder into which it had\nfallen. It was thereupon determined to carry on the adminis-\ntration by British agency, giving the rajah a fixed allowance,\nwith the understanding that the administration should be made\nover to him partially, or entirely, when it should be deemed\nsafe to trust it to his hands. This plan, thus dictated by\ntemporary necessity, was attended with such success, that the\nrevenue\\(^6\\) which, as already mentioned, had fallen so disas-\ntrously, was in one year considerably more than doubled. To\nprovide for defence, and to maintain tranquillity, the Jaloun\nforce (afterwards called the Bundelcund legion) was increased,\nand made available for the service of this state, as well as of\nthat for the protection of which it had originally been raised.\\(^*\\)\n\nPergunnah Mote, which belonged to the British government,\nbut had been granted in isteemwarra tenure to the rajah of\nJhansi, subject to an annual rent, which had not been paid,\nwas in consequence resumed,\\(^6\\) and placed under the manage-\nment of the superintendent of Jaloun. After a few years of\nBritish management, the country having attained that state in\n\n\\(^*\\) The circumstances under which this legion was disbanded are referred\nto in a note to the article on the district of Jaloun.\nwhich it appeared safe to make the transfer always contemplated, it was given up to the management of its native chief, subject to a cession of territory, in commutation of the annual payment previously made towards the support of the Bundelcund legion, and to other necessary conditions. This took place in 1843.*\n\nIt would appear that in 1848 the revenue of the rajah reached the sum of 61,198l. An annual payment of 7,500 rupees is made to this chief by the British government, on account of the lapsed territory of Chirgong. The native force is said to amount to 3,000 infantry, 200 cavalry, and 40 artillery; total, 3,240 men.\n\nJHANSI, in Bundelcund, a town, the principal place of the small territory of the same name, lies on the route from Agra to Saugor. Hunter, who visited the place in 1792, says, \"It is frequented by the caravans from the Deccan, which go to Furruckabad and the other cities of the Doobab. Hence, an afflux of wealth, which is augmented by a considerable trade in the cloths of Chanderi, and by the manufacture of bows, arrows, and spears, the principal weapons of the Boondela tribe.\"\n\nThe town is situate amidst tanks, and groves of fine timber-trees, and is surrounded by a good wall. On a rock overlooking the town, is a fortress, or castellated residence of the rajah, a lofty mass of building, of stone, more striking from being surmounted by a huge round tower. This fort is said to have between thirty and forty pieces of cannon. It was built by the Mahrattas, from whom it was wrested in 1761, and for some time detained by the nawaub of Oude, who reduced it almost to ruins. The streets and bazars are clean and orderly, the rajah paying great attention to their due regulation. There is another hill 600 yards south-east of that on which the fort is situate, and of nearly equal elevation to it. Jhansi\u2020 is\n\n* De Cruz states (as mentioned in the text) that Jhansi was subjected to the payment of tribute. No mention is made of this in the treaty of 1817; but if, nevertheless, the fact were as stated, it is to be presumed that the tributary engagement was merged in the general arrangement of 1843, under which annual payments for the support of troops were commuted by cessions of territory.\n\n\u2020 The population of the town is 60,000, according to Captain Sleeman, 1\nJHA\u2014JHE.\n\n142 miles S. of Agra, 130 miles N. of Saugor, 245 miles W. of Allahabad by Banda, and 740 N.W. of Calcutta by Allahabad.

Lat. 28\u00b0 24', long. 77\u00b0 6'.\n\nJHEEND.\u2014A small native territory within the limits of the tract of country over which the British government maintains a controlling power, through the commissioner and superintendent of the Cis-Sutlej states. Some years since, the territory lapsed, from failure of direct heirs, and possession was taken of it; but, in 1837, the larger portion was granted to a collateral heir. In 1842, the revenue of the state thus constituted was estimated at three lacs of rupees, or 30,000l.; but this estimate is inapplicable to the present condition of the state, as, on the conclusion of the war with Lahore, an accession of territory was bestowed on the rajah, in consideration of his fidelity during that contest. The possessions of this state being made up of scattered portions of territory, there is much difficulty in dealing with them as a whole; but they are returned as having an area of 376 square miles, and a population of about 56,000 persons. The British government, in granting to the rajah an extension of dominion, took who, however, brings forward no grounds for adopting an estimate incredibly great for a place so obscure.\nadvantage of the opportunity furnished by the act of favour, to promote the cause of public improvement, and advance the interests of humanity, by binding\\(^3\\) the rajah to abolish transit-duties, to make and keep in repair a military road, and to suppress suttee, infanticide, and slave-dealing.\n\n**JHEEND,\\(^1\\) in Sirhind, a town situate on Feroz Shah's canal, in a naturally fertile country, but which, in consequence of deficient cultivation, is extensively overrun with jungle, especially of dakh\\(^2\\) (Butea frondosa). It is a considerable town, and is the chief place of the native state bearing the same name: there is a good bazar, and a palace,\\(^3\\) the residence of the rajah. The road in this part of the route, which is in general good, crosses the canal by a bridge. Supplies are abundant. Jheend is distant N.W. from Calcutta 970 miles. Lat. \\(29^\\circ 19'\\), long. \\(76^\\circ 28'\\).\n\n**JHELUM, or BEHUT.\u2014**A river of the Punjab, and the most western of the five great rivers which intersect that region east of the Indus. It rises in Cashmere, the whole valley of which it drains, making its way to the Punjab, through the Pass of Baramula,\\(^1\\) in the lofty range of Pir Panjal. Its most remote source is the head of what is regarded by some as its principal feeder, the Lidur,\\(^2\\) which rises in the mountain-range bounding the valley on the north-east, and in lat. \\(34^\\circ 8'\\), long. \\(75^\\circ 48'\\); and, having drained the small mountain-lake called Sheeha Nag, takes a south-westerly course of about fifty miles, to its confluence with the Breng, flowing from the south-east. About ten miles to the north-west, this united stream forms a junction with a large feeder flowing from the south, and itself formed by the junction of the Sandren, the Veshau, the Huripur, and some other streams of less importance, none having a length of course exceeding forty miles. Of these, the Veshau is the principal, and, according to Vigne, so far exceeds in size the other upper feeders of the Jhelum, that its fountain-head should be regarded as properly the source of that great river. The Veshau flows by a subterraneous passage from Kosah Nag, a small but deep lake, situate near the top of the Pir Panjal Mountain, and at an elevation of about 12,000 feet above the level of the sea. Here, Vigne\\(^3\\) states, \"its full strong torrent is suddenly seen gushing out from the foot of the last and lofty eminence that forms the...\"\ndam on the western end of the lake, whose waters thus find an outlet, not over, but through, the rocky barrier with which it is surrounded.\" This remarkable spot is in lat. $33^\\circ 35'$, long. $74^\\circ 43'$. The stream thus produced and reinforced, subsequently receives numerous small feeders; passes through the City Lake, the Manasa Lake, and the Wulur or Great Lake, and sweeps through the country, confined by embankments, which prevent it from overflowing the lower part of the valley. Previously to entering the Wulur, it receives a considerable tributary named the Sinde, which rises in the lofty range bounding the valley on the north. The whole course of the Jhelum through the valley, before it finds an outlet through the Pass of Baramula into the lower ground of the Punjab, is about 130 miles, for seventy of which it is navigable. It is the opinion of Vigne, that the river made its way gradually through this pass, and thus drained the lake, which, according to tradition, formerly occupied the site of the valley. At Baramula, where the stream is 420 feet broad, is a bridge of seven arches. At Mozafarabad, about 205 miles from its source, it is joined by the Kishengunga, a stream of nearly equal volume, which rises in Little Tibet, receives a considerable tributary from the valley of Gurys, and subsequently makes its way through the mountains stretching from Cashmere to the vicinity of Attock. The united stream takes a course nearly due south, from Mozafarabad, and, about 255 miles from its source, leaves the mountains, and enters on the plain of the Punjab, near the town of Ohind, whence it is navigable to the Indus. It is here a very great stream, though considered by Burnes less than the Chenaub. Von H\u00fcgel, at the commencement of January, when the rivers of the Punjab are lowest, crossed it at the town of Jhelum, sixty-five miles lower down, on a bridge of twenty large boats, and estimated it to have a greater volume of water than the Indus at Attock. Moorcroft, at the same place, found it in the middle of October 150 yards wide, and from twelve to sixteen feet deep, but 600 yards wide at a short distance both above and below that point, and flowing at the rate of about a mile an hour. At this place the direction of the Jhelum changes from southerly to south-westerly. At Jelalpoor, from which point Burnes descended by a boat to Pind Dadun Khan, the\nJHELUM.\n\nstream was muddy but rapid, with a current of three or four miles an hour. Elphinstone\\(^4\\) crossed the river at Jelalpoor, in July, when he found it one mile, one furlong, and thirty-five perches wide, with a depth of from nine to fourteen feet, and a current running four miles an hour. It abounds in fish, and is infested by great numbers of crocodiles. Below Jelalpoor, it takes a direction nearly southerly, and joins the Chenaub a little above the ferry of Trimo, in lat. \\(31^\\circ 10'\\), long. \\(72^\\circ 9'\\), after a course of about 480 miles. The Jhelum was, at the confluence, when observed by Burnes at the end of June, about 500 yards wide. After the union, the channel of the united waters was a mile broad and twelve feet deep.\\(^*\\)\n\nThe Jhelum was unquestionably the Hydaspes of the Greeks. It is still known to the Hindoos of the vicinity by the name of Betusta,\\(^b\\) corrupted by the Greeks, according to their usage with respect to foreign names. The scene of the battle between Porus and Alexander is generally placed at Jelalpoor.\n\nJHELUM.\\(^1\\)\u2014A town of the Punjab, on the right bank of the river of the same name. Jhelum is a town of considerable extent, with a population mostly Mahomedan.\\(^2\\) It is, however, rendered unhealthy by the inundation, which extends widely over the eastern bank of the river. The principal crops in the vicinity are wheat, barley, and cotton. During the season when the river is lowest, there is a ford nearly a mile above the town. The passable part of the bed describes two sides of a triangle, the vertex of which is down the river.\\(^3\\) By this ford the British army crossed in the middle of December, 1839, in its return from Afghanistan; and though this is the low season, several were swept down the stream, and eleven persons, including an officer, drowned. Hough, who was present on the occasion, states, \u201cthe ford extended over a line of about 500 yards, and had more than three feet water, and a strong current near the south bank.\u201d It is obvious that, for the greater part of the year, the ford must be totally impassable. The elevation of Jhelum above the sea is estimated at 1,620 feet. It is expected that steam communication between Kurrachee and\n\n\\(^*\\) Burnes, who visited the confluence when the rivers were fullest, expresses his wonder that it should be so tranquil, contrary to the description of Arrian (L. v. c. xx.).\n\n\\(^4\\) Macartney, in Elph. 658.\n\n\\(^b\\) Vigne, ii. 181.

It is opposite the city of Allahabad, with which it communicates by a ferry across the Ganges. A more frequented communication between the\nleft bank of the river and the British cantonments, which adjoin the city on the north, is at Daraganj, two miles higher up. The bed of the river is there a mile\\(^2\\) in width, but in the dry season the stream occupies only a third of it, the remainder being used as a road. It is always heavy, either from sand or mud. This ferry has thirty boats, and troops and stores are passed free of charge. In some seasons the Ganges is impassable here by ferry, in consequence of shifting sands, and the passage must then be made at Papamow, five miles higher up. These sands form a great obstruction to the navigation of the Ganges below Cawnpore. It flows \"in a race\"\\(^3\\) over a shifting channel in the dry season, and has a very strong current\\(^4\\) (in some places seven miles an hour) during the rains.

It is bounded on the north by the British districts of Hurriana and Rohtuk; on the east by Delhi, Goorgaon, and Alwur; on the south by Goorgaon and the territory of the Alwur rajah; and on the west by Shekawutty and the pergunnah of Loharoo. It lies between lat. $27^\\circ 55'$\u2014$28^\\circ 55'$, long. $75^\\circ 55'$\u2014$76^\\circ 58'$, and has an area of about 1,230 square miles. The general elevation of the country may be estimated at 820 to 840 feet above the level of the sea, as, in the rainy season, it is pervaded by numerous watercourses having a very slight declivity, and which, about thirty miles to the eastward of the territory, discharge themselves into the Jumna, by a channel close to the north side of the city of Delhi, at an elevation of 800 feet. The southwestern part is intersected by numerous low rocky ranges, like those of the adjacent territory of Patun. The jaghire is traversed from north to south by the military route from Hansee to Nusseerabad and Neemuch, and from west to east by the route leading from the town of Dadree to that of Jujhur. The principal places are Jhujhur, Narnot, Dojana, Dadree, and Kanound. The annual revenue is estimated at 60,000l. The nawaub maintains a military force of about 3,000 men, and is bound to furnish 400 cavalry when demanded by the British government. The jaghire being well managed, is in a prosperous condition. If the population be estimated at ninety to the square mile, the average of the adjacent district of Hurriana, it will amount to 110,700. This jaghire was assigned by Lord Lake to Nijabut Ally Khan, of the Bhuraitch family, in consequence of his services against the Mah-rattas, from whom it was taken; and in 1806 the grant was confirmed in perpetuity by the Governor-General. Fyze Ally Khan, the present nawaub, grandson of the original grantee, succeeded in 1835.\n\nJHUJHUR, the principal place of the jaghire of the same name, and the residence of the nawaub, lies on the route from Hansee to Muttra, by Goorgaon, and 60 miles S.E. of the former place. Water is obtained from a large reservoir of masonry; supplies are abundant, and there is good encamping-furnishes the quota of troops for whose support the district was granted.\nground on the west side of the town. At the close of the last century, it was by the Mahrattas assigned, with some other places, to the adventurer George Thomas,\\(^3\\) in reward of his services, and was for some time the capital of his short-lived state.

In February the stream might be twenty feet wide, knee-deep, and not rapid.\" After a course of about six miles, it joins a branch of the Gunduk, and the united streams flow southerly for thirty miles, when, below and east of Pudrownan, they again separate. The Jhurrie takes a southerly course for thirty-six miles, when it crosses over into the British district Sarun, through which it flows in the same direction for about twenty miles. It then forms for ten miles the boundary between the two districts of Goruckpore and Sarun, after which, passing into the latter, and continuing to flow southward through it for twenty-eight miles, it falls into the Ghaghra on the left side, in lat. \\(26^\\circ\\), long. \\(84^\\circ 11'\\), having a total course of 130 miles.

The jaghire is estimated to contain twenty-seven square miles, with a population of 2,800. Its revenue is estimated at 1,500l. per annum. The jahgiredar maintains nineteen horse and fifty-one foot. In 1840, the mal-administration of the jaghire having become intolerable, managers responsible to the British authorities were appointed. Jignee is 33 miles S.W. of Calpee.

During the existence of the Mussulman monarchy of Beejapoor, it was the principal\u2074 depot of the maritime force of the Seedee or African admiral of that state, who held his dignity on condition of maintaining a fleet for the protection of commerce, and conveying pilgrims to the Red Sea. After the rise of the power of the Mahrattas, it was attacked repeatedly, but in vain, by Sevajee.\u2075 On one occasion, the garrison revolted, and placed the fort in the hands\u2076 of Aurungzebe. Rajapoor, on the mainland, had previously been taken by the Mahrattas. In 1682, Sambajee, son of Sevajee, besieged the island, which he attempted to connect by means of a mole with the mainland; but the project failed, and in other attempted modes of attack, the assailants were repulsed with great loss.\u2077 On the decline of the realm of Delhi, the Seedee or chief of Jinjeera assumed independence, which he and his successors maintained more or less effectually, and the petty power still\u2078 exists, under the protection of the East-India Company. The Jinjeera principality lies between lat. 18\u00b0 and 18\u00b0 32', and its revenues are computed at 17,500l.

According to report, the Nerbudda, Sone, and Johila rise near each other; the Nerbudda from the kund or pool of Ummurkuntuk, the Sone three or four miles further east, and the Johila about the same distance north. The Hindoo story runs, that the titular deity of the Sone, a male divinity, became enamoured of the Nerbudda, a female, whose handmaiden Johila attempting to personate her mistress in an interview with the lover, was so severely chastised by the enraged Naisad, that she melted into tears, whence ever since the stream Johila has continued to flow.

Inclusive of Ootrach or Turoch,* with which it has been incorporated, this state is bounded on the north by Poondur, a detached district of Keonthul, and Bussahir; on the east by Bussahir and Gurwhal, the Pabur separating it from the former, and the Tonse from the latter; on the south\n\n* See OOTRACH for particulars.\nJOOBUL.\n\nby Sirmour; and on the west by Sirmour and Bulsun. It lies between lat. 30\u00b0 48'\u201431\u00b0 6', long. 77\u00b0 32'\u201477\u00b0 54': it is stated to have an area of 330\u00b2 square miles. Its northern part lies in the extensive valley of the Pabur, along the right bank of that river; its southern is comprised within the valley of the Shalwee, a tributary of the Tonse. The valley of the Pabur is described by Jacquemont\u2078 as one of the most delightful tracts he had ever seen, especially that subdivision in which Deohra, the residence of the rana, is situate. The mountains, rising with a gentle slope, are formed into numerous terraces, yielding crops of rice, amaranth, and other grain, amidst which groves and hamlets are dispersed, while thick and lofty forests overspread the higher parts. The elevation of Joobul in general is very considerable. That of the great peak of Chur, at the south-western frontier, is 12,149\u2074 feet; that of Urrukta, in the north, above 10,000.\u2076 The elevation of the bed of the Pabur at Raingarh, on the north-eastern frontier, is 4,932\u2076 feet.\n\nThe geological character of Joobul appears to have been but very partially investigated. The summit of the Chur peak, on the southern frontier, is of granite.\u2077 Obscure hints of the writers on the subject appear to indicate that mica-slate, and various schistose forms, extend north-westward of that, and intervene between it and the great gneiss zone, forming generally the Indo-Gangetic range, or outer Himalaya. Jacquemont\u2078 found the prevalent formations on the northern part to be mica-slate, quartz, clay-slate, and gneiss; the latter usually forming the summits of the mountains.\n\nNo part of this district reaches the limits of perpetual congelation, Chur being free from snow\u2079 during the summer months: the temperature of the low valleys on the banks of the Pabur sometimes approximates to that of Hindostan. No country is better wooded; the northern face of the Chur especially, and the mountains stretching from it, being covered with dense forests of deodar (Cedrus deodara), attaining a height of 150 feet and a girth of thirty;\u00b9 with various other coniferae, pines, firs, and larches. There are also oaks, rhododendrons, hollies, horse-chestnuts, birches, and gigantic\u00b2 alders, sometimes twenty feet in girth. But those fine trees, though equal to any in the world in size, strength, and durability of timber, are useless to man, from the impossibility of conveying\n\n\u00b9 Royle, Botany of Himalaya, 361.\n\u00b2 Mundy, Sketches, in India, i. 367.\nthem to the plains over the rugged country intervening. Great havoc is made among the trees by the natives, who use them largely in the construction of their houses, and who, being unacquainted with the use of the saw, split the trunk with wedges, and then roughly dress the wood with an axe, so that a whole tree is frequently cut up to furnish a plank.\n\nThe people of Joobul are said to be distinguished by beauty of person, and some of the natives are nearly as fair as Europeans. The dress of the men consists of a pair of loose trousers, of thick striped woollen stuff; a sort of capote of similar stuff, reaching to the knees, and girt tight round the waist, but having many folds from the hip downwards; a cotton scarf, a shaggy flat woollen cap, and shoes of a sort of close network or twill of woollen thread, with a leather sole. Women appear in public without reserve, but are treated with little kindness or delicacy by their male relatives, who make no scruple in selling them. Mundy relates, that at Deohra \"an instance of this was afforded to Lord Combermere's party, a very pretty girl being brought to the camp, and offered for sale, at the moderate price of 150 rupees; more than which sum,\" adds the writer, \"I have seen given for a Scotch terrier at Calcutta.\" The religion of the people is Brahminism; the language, a dialect of the Hindee. The population is believed to amount to about 15,000. The revenue is estimated at 14,136 rupees, or 1,413l. The military force consists of 800 infantry. The rana, or ruler, a descendant of a Rajpoot family, was restored to power by the British on the expulsion of the Goorkhas, in 1815. By the same authority, he was excluded in 1833, and an annual pecuniary provision assigned to him, which he, however, pertinaciously refused to accept.

The approach\u00b2 from the south-west is very picturesque, the road for some miles passing through rich topes of mango, tamarind, and other trees; and near the walls are some gardens in high cultivation. It is surrounded by a rampart about five\u00b3 miles in circumference, with numerous massive square towers\u2074 and crenellated parapet, and is situate advantageously on a ridge of sandstone. Within the rampart, and in the north-east of the area inclosed by it, is the citadel,\u2075 the ground-plan of which is an irregular trapezium of very great size. The huge rampart of hewn stone is on the outside strengthened by a deep and wide ditch, hewn in the solid rock. The most remarkable building within this citadel is a large mosque, built,\u2076 it has been conjectured, from the ruins of ancient temples. It is 140 feet in length, and 100 in breadth. The roof is supported by above 200 pillars and pilasters of granite, and there is a finely-sculptured pulpit, consisting of one solid block of variegated marble. The citadel is supplied with water from a reservoir cut in the solid rock\u2077 to the depth of 120 feet. It is of an elliptical form, the longer diameter being about seventy-five feet. On one of the western bastions of this citadel, is a huge piece of brass ordnance, the length of which is twenty-two feet, the diameter at the breech two feet two inches, at the muzzle nineteen inches, and the calibre ten inches and a quarter. There are two inscriptions, indicating that it was cast in Turkey. This vast fortress, which is called Uparkot,\u2078 is at present overgrown with jungle, the sureefa or wild custard-apple predominating among the vegetation. Though thus neglected, yet, by the orders of the nawaub of Joonaghur, it is guarded externally \"with a jealousy perfectly oriental,\" and admission within it is a matter of peculiar favour. The town\u2079 is ill built, with narrow, filthy streets; and not more than half of the space inclosed within the walls is\n\n\u00b9 E.I.C. Ms. Doc.\n\u00b2 Journ. As. Soc.

The chief, a Mussulman, styled the nawaub of Joonaghur, holds territory comprising 506 villages, and is joint proprietor of thirty-nine more; the whole estimated to contain a population of about 284,800.

The town is situate on the left bank of the Aluknunda, in a hollow recess, and on a declivity, being sheltered on every side by a circular ridge, and especially to the north, where a high mountain intercepts the cold blasts rushing from the Himalaya, rising in that direction. The entrance to the town is up a bank cut into steps faced with slate or stone, with both which materials the streets also are paved, but very irregularly. The houses are neatly built of grey stone, and roofed with shingles. Amongst them is the residence of the rawal or high-priest of Bhadrinath, who lives here for the six months during which the approaches to the elevated temple that he serves are buried under snow. The building containing the idol Nara Singha is more like a private residence than a Hindoo temple. It is built with gable-ends, and covered in with a sloping roof of plates of copper. Pilgrims halting here, put up in a large square, having a stone cistern, supplied by two brazen spouts, which yield a never-failing flow of water, derived from a stream descending from the Himalaya. A collection of temples, bearing marks of great antiquity, extend along one side of the square, being ranged along a terrace about ten feet high. In the centre of the area is a temple sacred to Vishnu, surrounded by a wall thirty feet square. Several of those temples are much dilapidated, having been partially overthrown by earthquakes. The temples of Vishnu, Ganesa, Surya or the Sun, and the Naudevi, have suffered least. The statue of Vishnu is of black stone, in a very superior style of workmanship. It is about seven feet high, and is supported by four female figures, standing on a flat pedestal. The image of Ganesa is two feet high, well carved, and polished. In the town is a line of water-mills, placed one below the other, at intervals of fifteen or twenty yards, and turned by one stream, which, flowing from the mountain above, is supplied to them in succession by a communication through troughs of hollowed trunks of firs. Joshimath is situate on the route from Hindoostan to Chinese Tartary, through the Niti Pass, and also on that by the Mana Pass. The town contains 119 houses, of which twenty-one belong to Brahmins, fourteen to merchants, sixty-eight to Ganga; having, according to this last authority, the name \"from its flowing near the feet of Vishnu at Bhadrinath.\"\ncultivators, and the rest to other classes.

It is 330 miles in length from south-west to north-east, and 160 in breadth in the direction of the opposite angles. It lies between lat. 24\u00b0 36'\u201427\u00b0 40', long. 70\u00b0 4'\u201475\u00b0 23', and has an area of 35,672 square miles.\u00b2 The most marked feature in the physical aspect of the country is the river Lonee, which, rising on the eastern frontier near Pokur, takes a south-westerly course, nearly bisecting the territory, and forming the boundary between the fertile and sterile tracts; the former lying along the south-eastern or left bank, the latter along the north-western. The western part, bordering on the great desert of Scinde, is, throughout, a mere desolate\u00b3 waste. Eastward of this are numerous long ranges of rocky hills, dividing the Great from the Little Desert, which occupies the right bank of the Lonee, and runs up north-eastward between the city of Joudpore and Pokhurn. The Little Desert appears to be covered with sandhills nearly throughout, though low rocks\n\n* Such is the height. Traill\u00b9 states it at 7,500 feet.\n\n\u2020 Hamilton\u00b9 assigns, as its etymology, Yuddapoor, \"the city of war.\" Tod derives it from Joda,\u00b2 a native prince, who founded the capital in 1459. According to the same author,\u00b3 \"Marwar is a corruption of Marowar, classically Maroosthali or Maroosthan, the region of death. It is also called Maroodessa, whence the unintelligible Mardes of the early Mahomedan writers. The bards frequently style it Mordhur, which is synonymous with Maroodessa, or, when it suits their rhyme, simply Maroo. Anciently it comprised the whole desert between the Sutlej and the ocean.\"\n\n\u00b9 Ut supra, 149.\n\u00b2 East-India Gazetteer.\n\u00b3 Annals of Rajasthan, ii. 18.\n\u2074 Ut supra, ii. 1.\nshow themselves on each flank towards Joudpore and Mundor on the east, and Poghurn and Phulodi on the west. On the eastern frontier, the country swells upwards to the Aravalli range, which rises boldly to the height of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. The whole of the south part of Joudpore, about Sachor, Jalor, and Siwana, exhibits a succession of rocky hills; the eastern parts, about Pali Nimaj and Merta, are less stony, and there is much arable ground between Balotra and the capital, as well as on the north-east frontier. On the southern frontier are occasional appearances of rocks, generally regarded as volcanic by geologists. Stewart states porphyry to be the prevailing, if not the only rock in that region; \"which near the town of Nuggur-Parkur rises in a range of lofty hills to the height of 1,000 feet, assuming, in its rugged features, a regularity equally singular as picturesque.\"\n\nThe climate is very hot in summer, but cold, healthy, and bracing in winter, when severe frosts sometimes occur. Throughout the western part, the generally sandy nature of the country renders the air dry and healthy at all times, so that it is a common native proverb, that neither mud, mosquitoes, nor malaria are to be found in those regions. The case is different towards the south-east, where the Lonee occasionally rolls along with a great body of water, and the country is cut up by numerous torrents, which eventually discharge themselves into that river. There is consequently much swamp in that region during the rains, and Joudpore, the capital, itself is then considered unhealthy.\n\nSalt abounds in this territory, large quantities being extracted from the waters of the Sambhur Lake, about twelve miles long and five broad, situate on the north-east frontier. Salt is also extracted at Deedwana, 110 miles north-east of Joudpore; at Puchbhudra, sixty miles south-west of that place; and at Phulowdee, seventy miles north-west of it. Boileau considers that the numerous rocky hills in the east and south of this country contain various metals, as the range which passes into Ajmeer from the northward contains lead, iron, copper, and silver; but these promising deposits do not appear to have been worked in Joudpore. There are very fine quarries of white marble at Mukrana, 120 miles north-east of the town of\nJoudpore, which is itself built on a hill of a hard red freestone, of excellent quality as a building material. The calcareous conglomerate called kankar is abundant in many districts, and burned to make lime for mortar; tin and lead are found at Sojut, alum about Pali, and iron is obtained from the districts adjoining Guzerat. Tod\u2079 classifies the soils of Joudpore under the following heads:\u2014Baikal, the most prevalent, is a light sand, having little or no earthy admixture, and only fit to produce bajra (millet), moong and moth (kinds of pulse), til (sesamum), melons, and other cucurbitaceous plants; chikni, a fat black earth, producing chiefly wheat; pila, a sandy clay, adapted for barley, also for tobacco, onions, and various other vegetables; suffed (white), consisting nearly of pure silex, and producing scarcely anything, except after heavy rains. Cotton is cultivated to a considerable extent, but is a precarious crop, being sometimes totally destroyed by frost, as happened during Tod\u2019s\u00b9 visit, when every pod was nipped, the cold being so severe as partially to freeze the water in his bags. The districts along the base of the Aravulli being watered by the numerous small streams which flow down from that range, produce every kind of grain except bajra, which thrives best in a sandy soil. On an average for the whole country, the majority of the inhabitants are supported on bajra or moth. The emperor Shir Shah meeting with some reverses during his invasion of the country in the year 1544, declared that he had nearly lost the empire of India for a handful of millet, alluding to the poverty and low produce of Joudpore.\u00b2\n\nThe zoology is neither rich nor varied. The banks of the Lonee are in places infested by lions\u00b3 and leopards, and tigers have been discovered in some dense and secluded jungles; there are, towards Cutch, wolves,\u2074 hyenas, jackals, and three kinds of foxes: nylgaus, antelopes, and wild asses roam about the southern frontier towards Sinde. According to the account given by Macmurdo,\u2075 who shot several, the wild ass \u201cis an inhabitant of the salt wastes, so common in the desert, but frequents the cultivated country in the cold season, and does considerable damage to the crops. The wild ass is thirteen hands high; has a back, neck, and body of a light-brown colour, with a belly approximating to white. He has the dark stripe down the back in common with all dun animals. His\n\n\u00b9 Ibid. Hist. of India, 290.\n\u00b2 Boisseau, 170.\n\u00b3 Transactions Lit. Soc.

His voice is a bray, but is so fine as to resemble that of a frightened deer. The animal is gregarious, being generally seen in herds, from ten to fifty; he is, however, occasionally found singly and in pairs.\" His food consists of the saline grasses and shrubs of the desert, and he is never seen in bad condition: he prefers brackish water to fresh. The flesh of this animal is said to afford tolerable food. Wild hogs are not uncommon in various parts of Joudpore. Game-birds are scarce, though there are a few wild ducks and grey partridges. Snakes are so common, that in some places the people are obliged to protect themselves against them by means of thick leggings or gaiters. Camels and horses are bred in great numbers, and fetch good prices. The kine of Nagor are highly celebrated; a pair broken in for draught are worth from sixty to ninety rupees. Great numbers of sheep graze in the wilder tracts of the country, and their fleeces are in large quantities converted into coarse cloths and blankets. Coarse cottons are also manufactured for home consumption. Matchlocks, swords, and other warlike instruments, are fabricated at Joudpore, at Nagor, and at Pali; at which latter places are made tinned boxes of iron, resembling those of Europe. Joudpore is famous for ivory-turning, as well as for ornamental manufactures in leather and glass; and all ordinary works in iron and brass are produced at Nagor. Iron platters, especially, are made in great numbers.\n\nThe natives of Joudpore are a commercial people, driving in every direction a brisk transit-trade, of which Pali is the chief mart. Their principal articles of commerce are camels, horses, oxen, sheep, hides, horns, tanning-bark, elephants' teeth, broad-cloths, silks, chintz, sandal-wood, camphor, musk, dyes, opium and other drugs, sugar, spices, coffee, dates, gum-arabic, salt, potash, cocoa-nuts, dyed blankets, arms, copper, iron, pewter, and borax. From Sinde are brought rice, wheat, butter, silk and cotton cloths. The people of Joudpore not only conduct this considerable commerce at home, but have overspread the neighbouring countries, where they have contrived to acquire for the most part the management of the trading concerns. According to Tod, natives of Marwar, principally of the Jain belief, constitute nine-tenths of the bankers and commercial...\nJOUDPORE.\n\nmen of India, and the tribe called Oswals have 100,000 families employed in commerce.\n\nThe Jats, a very ancient race, scattered over the great tract extending on the east of the Indus, from the Himalaya to the ocean, were probably the aboriginal population of this country, and still constitute five-eighths of the number of its inhabitants; two-eighths more being Rajpoots* of the Rahtor tribe, and the remainder Brahmins or Jains. The Charuns, a tribe of Rajpoots, have among their countrymen unbounded influence, discharging the sacerdotal office, as well as the duties of chroniclers. There is a general impression, that certain and sweeping ruin results from shedding their blood or that of their families, or in being instrumental to its being shed. Hence their influence; and they lose no opportunity of warning their children not to scruple sacrificing their lives, should the measure be necessary for maintaining the claims of their order. Trusting to such influence, one of this class generally becomes the safeguard of travellers dreading the attacks of Rajpoot freebooters. Should robbers approach, he warns them off by holding a dagger in his hand, and if they disregard him, he wounds himself, and throws his blood towards them, denouncing woe and ruin in the most terrific language which he can command. If this have not the desired effect, the operation of wounding himself is repeated with increased severity. In extreme cases, one of the Charun's relatives, often either an aged or an infant female, is put to death, and sometimes the principal actor himself commits suicide, in which he is imitated by his wives and children.4 Something of similar character to the Charuns, but inferior in pretension and influence, are the Bhats, or bards of the community, whose power is exercised by means of satirical songs, pictures, and effigies.\n\nThe population, estimated at the rate of fifty to the square mile, which is believed to be tolerably correct, would amount to 1,783,600.\n\nAll classes in Joudpore are inordinately addicted to opium. They are5 fit for nothing until they take it, and after its effects have passed, are little better than idiots, until the dose be repeated. Indulgence in this baneful habit is more necessary to the Rajpoot than his food, and to eat opium together is the\n\n* One of the subdivisions of the Khatri or military caste.\n\n4 Malcolm, Central India, ii. 135.\n5 Tod, i. 644.\nmost inviolable pledge. The burning of women on the funeral-pile of their deceased husbands was formerly frightfully prevalent. In 1728, six queens, and fifty-eight women of inferior position, were burned with the dead body of Maharaja Ajit Sinh.* Even at a very recent period, the atrocious practice had not become extinct, as, in 1844, the efforts of the British government to prevent the sacrifice in this way of six lives, on occasion of a deceased rajah's funeral, were unavailing. Happily, however, by the perseverance and well-timed suggestions of the British resident, the maharaja has at length been prevailed upon to prohibit the barbarous rite, and the necessary proclamation has been issued.\n\nThe language spoken in Joudpore is a peculiar patois, called Marwari, considered to have an affinity to Hindee. Some attention appears to be paid to education, there being, it is said, in the town of Joudpore, above 100 schools for the children of the humbler orders.\n\nThe ruler of Joudpore is styled Maharaja. The constitution, if the name can well be given to such an irregular political machine, is feudal, and the authority of the maharaja is checked by the counteracting power of a number of refractory thakors or chiefs, by whom the greater part of the country is held, on condition of military service, the feudatory being bound to furnish troops in proportion to his estate; but as some of the estates have been exempted from this burden, and the value of others falls greatly below the sums at which they have been estimated, the number of troops has diminished; and it is believed that the maharaja cannot rely upon muster-\n\n* The horrible scene seems to have stimulated the native writer, quoted by Tod, to urge his eloquence to the highest flights. He thus describes it:\u2014\u201cThe drum sounded, the funeral train moved on; all invoked the name of Heri (a deity). Charity was dispensed like falling rain, while the countenances of the queens were radiant as the sun. From heaven, Umia (a female deity) looked down; in recompense of such devotion, she promised they should enjoy the society of Ajit in each successive transmigration. As the smoke emitted from the house of flame, ascended to the sky, the assembled multitudes shouted Khaman! Khaman!\u2014well done! well done! The pile flamed like a volcano. The faithful queens laved their bodies in the flames, as do the celestials in the lake of Mansurwar (sacred lake in Himalaya). They sacrificed their bodies to their lords, and illustrated the races whence they sprung.\u201d\nJOUDEPORE:\n\ning more than 2,000 men from this source, instead of upwards of 4,000, which the estimates would seem to warrant. Tod\u00b2 gives the armed force at 11,000 men, including 2,500 cavalry, with fifty-five guns and a rocket establishment. The present military establishment consists,\u00b3 first, of the Joudpore legion, in lieu of the Joudpore contingent, amounting to 254 cavalry, 739 infantry, thirty-one artillery and Bheel companies, 222 strong, in all 1,246; and, secondly, of about 5,850 infantry and 2,680 cavalry, at the disposal of the Joudpore state; in addition to what the feudatories maintain. In the Ayeen Akbery, Joudpore is stated to furnish 15,000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry, and its revenue is there given at 868,218 rupees, equal to about 36,821l. Tod\u2074 refers to ancient archives, from which the total revenue, feudal and fiscal, would appear in former times to have reached the sum of eighty lacs, or 800,000l. This is altogether incredible and ridiculous. The present amount of revenue is 175,252l. Salt is a fertile source of income. According to Tod\u2019s account, \u201cthis productive branch of industry still employs thousands of hands, and hundreds of thousands of oxen, and is almost entirely in the hands of that singular race of beings called Brinjarries, some of whose tandas or caravans amount to 40,000 head of oxen. The salt is exported to every region of Hindostan, from the Indus to the Ganges, and is universally known and sold under the title of Sambhur Loon, or salt of Sambhur; notwithstanding the quality of the different lakes varies, that of Pachbadra, beyond the Loni, being the most esteemed. It is produced by natural evaporation, expedited by dividing the surface into pans, by means of mats of the airkunda grass, which lessens the superficial agitation. It is then gathered and heaped up into immense masses, on whose summit they burn a variety of alkaline plants, by which it becomes impervious to the weather.\u201d By the author just quoted, the other sources of revenue are stated to be buttae, or corn-rent; angah, or poll-tax; gasmali, or tax on cattle; kewari, or tax on doors; sayer, or commercial imposts. The state pays to the British government an annual tribute of 108,000 rupees, and a contribution towards the expense of the Joudpore legion, amounting to 115,000 rupees. The former payment was originally made to Scindia, on whose account it is still collected.\nby the British government, and applied by that government to the maintenance\\(^5\\) of Scindia's contingent.\n\nBesides Joudpore, the capital, nearly eighty places are mentioned by Boileau\\(^6\\) under the name of towns, though no doubt many of them little deserve the title. He enumerates thirteen hill forts and nine forts in the plain. Many of these places are described separately, as they occur in the order of the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe Rajpoot dynasty of Joudpore is by Tod\\(^7\\) supposed to have been established about the year 1212, by Seoji or Sivaji, son of the last Hindoo king of Kannouj, who perished in 1194, on the conquest of his capital by Shahab-ud-din,\\(^8\\) or Mohammed of Ghor, the subverter of the Ghaznevide empire in India; and that author gives the following account of the progress of the adventurers:\\(^9\\) \"In less than three centuries after their migration from Canouj, the Rahtores, the issue of Seoji, spread over a surface of four degrees of longitude and the same extent of latitude, or nearly 80,000 miles square; and they amount at this day, in spite of the havoc occasioned by perpetual wars and famines, to 500,000 souls.\"\n\nIn 1459,\\(^1\\) Jodha, the maharaja of Marwar, removed the seat of government from Mundor to Joudpore, a fort and residence which he had built a few miles to the south. About 1569, Akber made himself master of the greater part of the state of Joudpore, which he conferred on Udi Sinh,\\(^2\\) the son of the late maharaja, whom he had expelled. The power of Udi Sinh was subsequently strengthened by the marriage\\(^3\\) of his sister to Akber. About the year 1680, Aurungzebe, in one of his ineffectual attempts to enforce the observances of Mahomedanism, attacked and pillaged Joudpore, and most of the other towns in Marwar;\\(^4\\) defaced and desecrated the Hindoo temples, many of which were totally demolished; erected mosques on their sites, and compulsorily inflicted the outward mark of Islam on such Rajpoots as fell into his power. The yoke of the emperor of Delhi was, however, soon thrown off; but, for upwards of a century, the country was distracted by anarchy and a series of petty wars, till the conclusion of a treaty, ratified in the beginning of 1818, between the maharaja of Joudpore and the British government, of which the following were the chief points:\\(^5\\) 1. Perpetual amity and unity of interests\nbetween the contracting parties. 2. Protection to be afforded by the British. 3. Acknowledgment of British supremacy by the maharaja, and engagement by him to afford subordinate co-operation, and to have no connection with any other power. 4. Engagement on part of the maharaja, not to enter into negotiation with any power without permission of the British. 5. Engagement by the maharaja, to abstain from aggressions on any one; and if disputes should arise, to submit to the arbitration of the British government. 6. Tribute, previously payable to Scindia, to be transferred to the British, and the maharaja to be exonerated from any claim on the part of Scindia. 7. The guarantee by the British government of immunity on the last head. 8. The maharaja bound, on demand, to march his whole disposable force to join the British army. 9. The maharaja to be absolute in his own territory.\n\nFor several years subsequently to the conclusion of the treaty, there was little communication between the British government and Joudpore; but a series of disturbances commenced in 1824, which called for interposition, and the unsatisfactory nature of the arrangement then made, having led to their revival in 1828, when a pretender to the throne received the support of a large body of chiefs, eventually led to further interference, to the extent of a requisition from the British government to the pretender for the withdrawal of his claims. In 1829, Appa Sahib, the perfidious ex-rajah of Nagpore, having been expelled from Bikaneer, sought refuge in Joudpore, the ruler of which country was required by the British government to give him up, or at least to cause his departure in a given direction. Great reluctance was manifested towards complying with this demand, and it was withdrawn, on condition that the rajah of Joudpore should be responsible for the safe custody and peaceable conduct of Appa Sahib, so long as he should remain in the country. This act of considerate regard to the alleged feelings of Rajpoot hospitality was, as usual, very indifferently requited. The chief of Joudpore suffered his tribute to fall into arrear; supplied the stipulated military assistance reluctantly and tardily, protected plunderers, and was believed to have entered into political correspondence, having objects hostile to British interests and influence in India. These acts of misconduct were submitted\nto with great forbearance for a long period, during which the misgovernment and distraction of the country were extreme; and at length, from all these causes, it was deemed necessary to instruct Colonel Sutherland to proceed to Joudpore and demand reparation. His mission proving ineffectual, a body of troops was moved to enforce that which negotiation had failed to achieve. Their approach alarmed the rajah, who forthwith displayed tokens of submission. The immediate consequences were, the establishment of a council of regency, with a British agent at its head, to carry on the government in conjunction with the rajah, and the reception of a British garrison within his fortress. A variety of useful reforms followed.\n\nThe rajah died a few years after the commencement of the system which led to these beneficial steps, but they were pursued under his successor Tukht Singh, of Ahmednuggur, who was elected to the vacant throne by the thakors. Under the administration of this prince, various reforms have been effected; among the chief of which must be reckoned, as already noticed, the abolition of suttee.\n\n**JOUDPORE**, the capital of the Rajpoot state of the same name, is situate at the north-eastern edge of a cultivated but woody plain, which, farther south, passes into the low tract fertilized by the river Loni and its feeders. Its site is striking, being at the southern extremity of a ridge or rock twenty-five miles in length, between two and three in breadth, and rising between 300 and 400 feet above the average level of the plain. The city, inclosed by a rampart five miles in circuit, is built on an irregular surface, sloping upwards towards the base of the rock surmounted by the citadel, the view from which is thus described by Boileau:\n\n\"A bird's-eye view of the city from the summit of the upper fort is really magnificent. Perched upon a parapet of the bastion, encircling the pointed pagoda at the southern extremity of the citadel, we gazed with delight upon the fair scene at our feet. The whole of the city lies close to the rock on which the palace stands, surrounding its east, south, and west sides, the north side being occupied by a hilly neck, connecting the citadel with the Mundor range, and too much broken to afford good building-ground.\"\nlively green of the trees, and the quantity of fine white plaster applied to the red stone houses, afforded a pleasing variety of colours, and give the city a gay look. The numerous tanks, now filled with water; the white ramparts, running along the higher parts of the city; the piles of buildings crowded upon each other, and rising tier above tier to the Chandpol gate; and the confused mass of outworks on the west side of the citadel, formed a scene that will not soon be forgotten.\" On a closer inspection, however, the streets are said by this writer to have been found irregular and ill laid out, the houses mean and badly constructed, the place being inferior in this respect to the other capitals of Rajpootana, but containing some fine temples, especially the Pasbunka Mandir. Tod gives a different and more favourable account. \"The streets,\" he says, \"are very regular, and adorned with many handsome edifices of freestone.\" There are several tanks within the walls. The Pudum Sagur, in the north-western part of the city, is excavated in rock, but is of small dimensions; the Rani Sagur, in the same quarter, is at the foot of the western entrance into the citadel, with which it is connected by low outworks, placing it under the thorough command of the garrison, for whose exclusive use it is reserved, except an extreme emergency requires it to be thrown open to the citizens. The Goolab Sagur, on the east, is of great extent, and finely built of stone throughout. The Bai-ka-talao, recently built, is also extensive, and receives several conduits, conveying the water of many distant torrents. Yet, in long-continued droughts, all fail, except the Rani Sagur. There are above thirty wells of the kind called baoli, in which access is obtained to the water by means of steps: in some of these, the water is carried up to the surface by human labour or by the Persian wheel, though the depth in many instances exceeds forty feet. The Persian wheel is even used in the Tonr-jee-ka-Jhabra, where the depth, from the mouth above to the surface of the water, exceeds ninety feet, the depth of the water itself being also ninety feet. This fine well is cut in the solid rock, and, by the time-worn appearance of the carving in the interior, bears evidence of great antiquity. It is of immense size at the surface of the ground, and of square shape. On three sides, flights of steps\nlead down to the water, but the fourth side is perpendicular, to allow the working of the Persian wheel. The water is good, and never fails.\n\nThe wall about the town was, at Boileau's visit, in 1835, in a very bad state, and in many places some yards of the parapet, and even of the rampart, had fallen down so completely as to allow free passage between the interior and exterior; and on the south side, the sand had in one place drifted to within a few inches of the crest of the parapet. Two steeply-scarped masses of rock, 80 or 100 feet high, form part of the line of defence on the east side of the city, and are crowned with walls and towers on their outer faces. In the whole circuit there are 101 bastions and 70 gates, each bearing the name of the place to which it leads. The fortifications of the town are continuous with those of the citadel, which is, however, divided from it by a rampart on the brow of the ascent, and generally 370 feet above the plain. The elevation at the north-east angle is 382 feet; and the scarp wall, which covers the great gate there, has a sheer face of hewn stone 109 feet high. Other parts of the wall appear to be still higher. These defences are well built of stone quarried from the subjacent rock. In some places, however, the ramparts and bastions are weak and ill-constructed, and would be almost contemptible, but for the stiff section of the rocks on which they are erected. The main entrance is on the north. The road passing through it is practicable for heavy guns; and the access covered by six successive gateways, besides the inner one, opening immediately into the maharaja's palace. The road over the hilly ridge extending northward from the citadel, is practicable for heavy artillery; and the place could not long hold out against an attack conducted according to the rules of European warfare. The whole citadel is 500 yards long, and about half that breadth. The royal palace and buildings attached are situate at the north end, and occupy two-fifths of the area; an equal space is occupied by magazines, granaries, and other public buildings, and the remainder is empty. There are five reservoirs of water within the citadel, but in ordinary times the principal supply is derived from the Rani Sagur. The palace overtops all other buildings, and its highest part is 454 feet above the plain. The state apartments present little\nto excite admiration, being inferior to those of the humbler ruler of Bikaneer. The most remarkable is the chamber of audience, styled \"the thousand-columned hall,\" a vast apartment, the ceiling of which is supported by a great number of massive columns of no great height, arranged in parallel rows, about twelve feet asunder.\n\nOutside the city, and distant a cannon-shot from the northeast angle, is the large suburb, deriving its name of Mahamandir, or \"the great temple,\" from a building within it, which confers the right of sanctuary on its inclosure and environs. It constitutes a distinct town of 1,000 houses, with 112 shops, inclosed by a thin stone wall a mile and a quarter in circuit, having a few weak bastions, but without any parapet, unless that name can be given to battlements three feet high and five or six inches thick. The area is an irregular quadrangle, having a gateway in each of its faces. The temple above mentioned is surmounted by a spire, conspicuous from afar by the brilliant lime-wash with which it is covered. The interior is richly decorated, and the sacred shrine of the tutelary saint is placed under a canopy of silver, in the form of an umbrella. There is a tank, supplied with water brought from a distance by conduits. A baoli, eighty feet deep, has an inexhaustible supply of good water. A flight of steps reaches to the water's edge, and three Persian wheels raise and discharge no inconsiderable stream for irrigation and domestic purposes. The inclosure of the Mahamandir contains two palaces, one of which is inhabited by the maharaja's gooroo or spiritual adviser, who lives in great state; the other palace has no living occupant, being reserved by native superstition as the residence of the spirit of the last deceased gooroo, whose bed is laid out in one of the state-chambers, with a small golden canopy over the pillow.\n\nFive miles north of Joudpore are the striking ruins of Mandor, which was the capital of Marwar previously to the foundation of the present capital by Maharaja Jodha or Joda, in 1459. Hence the name of the town, and also of the eminence of its site, which is called Jodhagir,* or \"the warrior's hill.\" A mile and a quarter west of the town are hand-\n\n* Jodha, the proper name of the prince, signifies also \"warrior,\" and Gir signifies \"hill.\"\nJOUNPOOR.\n\nSome gardens, with a fine tank named Ukhe Rajka Tako, described by Boileau as \"a magnificent sheet of water, clear, deep, and extensive, resembling rather a natural lake than an artificial tank.\" Two or three miles north of this, is Bal Sumundur, a small but beautiful lake, half a mile long and about 200 yards wide, with craggy banks of red sandstone, feathered with picturesque shrubs, and bordered by a fine pleasure-ground, abounding in towering palm-trees. Two miles north of the city, and between the two last-mentioned pieces of water, is the Sur-Segor, an immense tank, on the southern embankment of which stands the Motimahall, or Pearl Palace, a beautiful building of white marble, from the flat roof of which is a fine view of the citadel. According to the estimate of Boileau, Joudpore city, citadel, and suburbs, contain 30,000 houses, which, at the usually-received average of five persons to each house, makes the population 150,000; an amount scarcely credible. Boileau elsewhere states the amount of the population at 129,150, which reduced number is, however, probably excessive. Tod says, \"The number of families some years ago, stated to be 20,000, probably 80,000 souls\u2014an estimate far too great for the present day.\"\n\nJoudpore is distant W. from Calcutta 1,128 miles; S.W. from Delhi, by Nusseerabad, 358 miles. Lat. 26\u00b0 10', long. 78\u00b0 8'.\n\nJOUNPOOR, under the lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a British district, named from its principal town. It is bounded on the north-west by the territory of Oude; on the north-east by the British district Azimgurh; on the east by the British district Ghazeeapore; and on the south by the British districts Benares and Allahabad. It lies between lat. 25\u00b0 22'\u201426\u00b0 12', long. 82\u00b0 12'\u201483\u00b0 10'; is sixty miles in length from east to west, fifty-five in breadth, and embraces an area of 1,552 square miles. It is a remarkably level tract, with a gentle declivity, probably not exceeding, on the average, six inches per mile, from north-west to south-east, as indicated by the course of its numerous streams flowing in that direction. The south-eastern extremity is about* 260 feet above the sea; and probably the elevation of\n\n* The elevation of Benares above the sea is about 270 feet, and the\nJOUNPOOR.\n\nno part exceeds 300 feet. The Goomtee, the principal stream, passes from Oude, over the north-western frontier, in lat. 26\u00b0 1', long. 82\u00b0 31'; takes a direction very sinuous, but generally south-easterly, and, passing by the city of Jounpoor, winds through the district, or skirts its boundary, for a total distance of about seventy-four miles, till, in lat. 25\u00b0 84', long. 83\u00b0 2', it crosses the south-eastern frontier, and forms the boundary between the British districts of Benares and Ghazeepore. Its channel is in general a deep, well-defined trench, formed by the current in kankar or calcareous conglomerate, wave-worn horizontal marks being visible on its banks. It is well adapted for navigation, the stream nowhere, and at no season, spreading to a breadth exceeding 140 yards, and generally, even at the driest season, having a depth of four feet. Baber, who, with a view to his military operations, was led anxiously to examine all its depths and shoals, observes, \"Though it is a narrow little river, yet it has no ford, so that troops are forced to pass it in boats, by rafts, and on horseback, or sometimes by swimming.\" During the periodical rains, the water seldom rises more than fifteen feet. In former times, it must have risen to double this height; and in 1774 it so completely swept over the celebrated bridge of Jounpoor, that a brigade of British troops sailed over it in their progress down the stream. The Sai, a river smaller than the Goomtee, but of much the same character, passes the north-west frontier in lat. 25\u00b0 50', long. 82\u00b0 18', and, holding a sinuous course, but generally in a south-easterly direction, for about fifty-two miles, falls into the Goomtee in lat. 25\u00b0 40', long. 82\u00b0 52'. Like the Goomtee, its course through this district is navigable. The total length of river navigation possessed by Jounpoor extends to about 126 miles.\n\nThe climate probably differs little from that of Benares, where the mean temperature for the year was found to be 79\u00b0 of Fahrenheit; the highest being in the month of June, slope of the waterway of the Ganges, for some distance below Benares, is five inches per mile; consequently, the elevation of Kaiti, close on the south-eastern extremity of the district of Jounpoor, and twenty-four miles lower down the stream than Benares, is about 260 feet above the sea.\nJOUNPOOR.\n\n103\u00b0, the lowest in January, 50\u00b0. The periodical rains fall through July, August, and September; and the total of rain for the year 1822 was thirty-three inches.\n\nThe soil is very productive,* and especially suited for the growth of sugar, being inferior to no ground in India for the abundance and excellence of that commodity. Successful cultivation is, however, altogether dependent on irrigation, the water for which is mostly drawn by human labour from streams, tanks, or wells. As streams are numerous, the country level, and the soil rather porous, water is found at a small depth below the surface; and there are wells in every field.\n\nThe extent of cultivation of sugar-cane in Jounpoor has been officially estimated at 28,158 acres. The total produce of goor, that is, the entire extract before the sugar is separated from the grosser matter with which it is combined, is estimated at 255,544 cwt., of which 61,247 cwt. are believed to be consumed within the district, at an average of ten pounds per head; leaving a surplus of 194,297. It will be obvious that such estimates, and especially in regard to internal consumption, must be subject to error, from various causes; but the above are probably not widely distant from the fact.\n\nThe population was ascertained by census in 1848 to amount to 798,503, being at the rate of more than 514 to the square mile\u2014a high average. Of the above number, 563,078 were returned as Hindoos and agricultural, 156,758 Hindoos non-agricultural, 30,620 Mahomedans and others not Hindoos, but employed in agricultural pursuits, and 48,052 persons not being Hindoos, devoted to other occupations. It thus appears that the preponderance of Hindoos in this district is overwhelming, the disciples of that creed being more than fifteen times as numerous as the followers of all other religions. The numbers of the agricultural class exceed those of the non-agricultural, in the proportion of nearly three to one.\n\n* Perhaps from laborious and skilful cultivation, and copious irrigation. Lord Valentia represents\u2020 the country as a complete sand, and the heat intense. But Sym, whose evidence before the committee of the House of Commons is quoted in the text, was a practical man, experienced in the subject, and not likely to be mistaken.\nJOUNPOOR.\n\nThe townships, villages, &c., are thus arranged according to population:\n\nNumber of towns and villages containing less than\n\n1,000 inhabitants ........................................... 2,843\nDitto more than 1,000 and less than 5,000 ...... 93\nDitto more than 5,000 and less than 10,000 ...... 1\u2020\nDitto more than 10,000 and less than 50,000 ...... 1\u2020\n\nTotal ............. 2,938\n\nThe civil establishment of Jounpoor consists of a civil and sessions judge, a magistrate and collector, a joint magistrate and deputy collector, an assistant to the magistrate and collector, a deputy collector of the second grade, under Regulation XIX. of 1833, an assistant surgeon, a principal sudder aumeen, and four moonsiffs.\n\nThe principal routes are,\u20141. South-west to north-east, from Allahabad\u00b2 cantonment to that of Jounpoor, 66 miles, and thence in the same direction to Azimgurh, 43 miles more; 2. from south to north, from\u00b3 Mirzapore cantonment to that of Jounpoor, 43 miles; 3. from\u2074 south-east to north-west, from Benares cantonment to that of Jounpoor, 38 miles, and thence in the same direction to Sultanpore in Oude, 58 miles further; 4. from\u2075 east to west, from Ghazeepore cantonment to that of Jounpoor, 60 miles.\n\nWith the exception of Jounpoor, the towns are unimportant; those most requiring notice,\u2014Singra or Sangrampur, Mureahu, Muchlishahr, Badshahpur, Zafarabad, and Ghissooa, as well as the capital,\u2014will be found in their proper places in the alphabetical arrangement.\n\nThe tract comprised within this district was probably first reduced under Mussulman sway by Muhammad Shahabuddin, the Patan ruler of Ghor, who is recorded\u2076 to have, at the close of the twelfth century, conquered Eastern India as far as the confines of China. During the confusion caused by the invasion of India by Timur, near the end of the fourteenth\u2021 century, or perhaps something earlier, Jounpoor, with some\n\n* Ghissooa, in pergunnah Ghissooa, 8,868.\n\u2020 Jounpoor, in pergunnah Jounpoor, 16,177.\n\u2021 According to Prinsep,\u00b9 A.D. 1397.\n\n\u00b2 Garden, Tables of Routes, 33-56.\n\u00b3 Id. 309.\n\u2074 Id. 94.\n\u2075 Id. 179.\n\u2076 Tarikhi Ain, as quoted by Bird in Pref. to Hist. of Gujarat, 83.\n\n\u00b9 India Tables, 148.\nadjacent tracts, was acquired by an officer of the padshah of Delhi. The Purebi Sherki, or Eastern dynasty, thus founded, was of no long duration, being overthrown in 1478, by Behlol Lodi, the Afghan padshah of Delhi, who reannexed Jounpoor to the empire, and made it an appanage of his son Barbik Khan. In 1527, it passed from the Afghans to the victorious Baber, being conquered by his son Humayon, acting under his orders. On the dissolution of the Timurian empire of Delhi, consequent on the invasion by Ahmed Shah Durani in 1760, it formed part of the spoil seized and retained by the nawaub vizier of Oude. In 1764, a firman or grant of this, among other districts, was made by Shah Alum, titular padshah of Delhi, to the East-India Company, who, by the treaty of Allahabad, relinquished to the nawaub vizier the claim thus founded, as well as the military occupancy established by the victory gained at Buxar in the preceding year. In 1775, it was ceded by the nawaub vizier to the East-India Company, and embodied with the dominions of that power. In the Ayeen Akbery, its military contingent is stated at about 915 cavalry and 36,000 infantry, and its revenue at 14,00,858 rupees.\n\nJOUNPOOR.\u2014The principal place of the British district of the same name, a city on the banks of the river Goomtee, here navigable, and generally unfordable. The river divides the city into two unequal parts, the greater on the left, the less on the right bank; and the communication is by means of an antique bridge, considered one of the finest specimens of architectural skill in India, but which, from the diminutive span of its arches, would scarcely be noticed in Europe. The roadway passes from the left or north-eastern bank, over ten arches, called, collectively, the great bridge, to an island in the channel, and, proceeding over it, is thence continued by the lesser bridge of five arches and a land arch, to the right side.\n\n* Purebi, \"eastern,\" in Hindoostanee; Sherki, \"eastern,\" in Arabic.\n\n\u2020 Jaunpur of Tassin; Jounpoor of Khairuddin; Jownpoor of the Ayeen Akbery; Joonpoor of Briggs's Index; Juanpur of Elphinstone; Junpur, Junapar, or Jionpur, of the translators of Baber; Jaunpur of Prinsep; Jionpur of Rennell; Juanpoor or Juanpore of British writers generally.\n\n\u2021 Lord Valentia, however, states it to be shallow in the dry season.\nJOUNPOOR.\n\nA native writer enumerates the spans of the arches and the breadth of the piers of the greater bridge. It is constructed of stone, so well cemented, that it is comparatively unimpaired, though nearly three centuries old, during which period it has resisted the floods, which sometimes sweep over it in such volume, that, in 1774, a fleet of boats conveying a British army, with a numerous train of baggage, camp-followers, and attendant animals, were borne down the stream, right across the line of roadway, without any impediment from the submerged structure. The building is said to have been commenced in the year 1564, and completed in three years, by Fahim, a freed man of Munim Khan, an officer high in the confidence of Akbar: the cost is reported to have amounted to 300,000l. The fort, situate on the bank of the river, is a vast massive stone structure, the ground-plan of which is an oblong quadrangle, half a mile in circuit. It is said to have been built A.D. 1370, by Feroz Shah Toghluk, Patan sovereign of Delhi, who named it after his cousin and predecessor on the throne. According to Lord Valentia, there is a gateway in the wall of the castle, \"ornamented with mosaic-work of different-coloured varnished tiles. It has been beautiful. The courts are extensive, and the verandas on the walls command a very pleasing prospect, particularly on one side, which overhangs the river and the bridge; beyond which are the ruins of the different tombs, raising their cupolas among palms and tamarind-trees. The distant country is rich in cultivation, and well clothed with wood.\" The fort has been used as a prison. On the east of the town is a large mosque, in very bad repair, but noble even in ruin. It is described by Tieffenthaler as a splendid structure of red stone, with three lofty domes, and a fore-court, surrounded by colonnades. It is stated to be fifty\n\n* A view of this bridge is given by Hodges, and also a view of the fort.\n\n+ Probably the left bank, though no traveller appears to specify its position.\n\n\u2021 This was Muhammad Shah Toghlak, who, before his accession, was called Joona Khan. According to Tieffenthaler, it was founded and named 200 years earlier, by Jona, \"a certain lady who tended kine.\" A more probable etymology than either is water-town; the Goomtee flowing through the city, and being liable to violent inundations.\n\nSelect Views in India, ii.

It has an area of 872 square miles, and belongs to a Patan chief, styled Nawaub of Jowra, the representative of Ghuffoor Khan, to whom, in 1818, the jaghire was secured by the British government, under the treaty of Mondesoor, concluded with Holkar, on condition that the nawaub and his heirs should maintain, independent of the sebundy (armed police) for his pergunnahs, and his personal attendants, in constant readiness for service, a body of 600 select horse; and further, that this quota of troops should be thereafter increased, in proportion to the increasing revenue of the districts granted him. The number of troops, inclusive of the sebundy, in the service of the nawaub, is 850; his annual revenue, in 1848, was 8,00,000 rupees; the population of the territory, including the jaghires of dependants, 85,456. The town, according to Malcolm, in 1820, contained 3,551 inhabitants; but Jacquetmont, in 1832, estimated their number at 10,000 or 12,000.

The town is situate on the north-western shore of the Bay of Bengal, in that part called the Coast of Orissa.\u00b9\n\nThe surf here is very violent, so that landing can be effected only by means of Masula boats, similar\u00b2 to those used on the Coromandel coast. During the south-west monsoon, a refreshing sea-breeze blows with little intermission, rendering the climate\u00b3 in the hot season one of the most agreeable and healthful in India. The beach has been selected as the site for the British military station. The town itself is to the south-west of the station, and on a low ridge of sandhills, to which an attempt has been made to give a factitious grandeur, by styling it Neilgherry, or Blue Mountain. \"Every span of it is holy ground; and the whole of the land is held free of rent, on the tenure of performing certain services in and about the temple. The principal street is composed almost entirely of the religious establishments called Maths, built of masonry, having low pillared verandas in front, and plantations of trees interspersed. Being very wide, with the temple rising majestically at the southern end, it presents by no means an unpicturesque appearance; but the filth and stench, the swarms of religious mendicants, and other nauseous objects which offend one's senses in every part of the town, quite dispel any illusion which the scene might otherwise possess. Fine luxuriant groves and gardens inclose the town on the land side, and produce the best fruit in the province.\" In the vicinity are many fine tanks, considered of great antiquity; and among\n\n\u00b9 Horsburgh, East-India Directory, i. 607.\n\u00b2 Bacon, First Impressions, i. 174.\n\u00b3 As. Res. xv. 198\u2014Stirling, Account of Orissa.\nthe sands, between the sea and the south-west face of the town, are numerous ancient and curious-looking edifices, now nearly overwhelmed with sand. The temple of Juggurnauth stands within a square area, inclosed by a lofty stone wall, measuring 650 feet on a side. The inclosure is entered on the east by a grand gateway, from which a broad flight of steps gives access to a terrace twenty feet in height, inclosed by a second wall, 445 feet square. From this platform the great pagoda rises, from a base thirty feet square, to the height of about 180 feet from the platform, or 200 from the ground, tapering from bottom to top, not in the form of a cone, but rounded off in the upper part with an outline approaching to the parabola. The present edifice appears to have been completed in the year 1198, at a cost of nearly half a million sterling. Most of the Hindoo deities have temples within the inclosure; and of those, two, besides the great pagoda, are peculiarly remarkable when viewed from sea, being described as \"three large circular buildings, surrounded by several smaller ones: they are of a conical form, decreasing in diameter from their bases to their summits, which are crowned with white domes, and an ornamental globe or urn and wind-vane. The westernmost pagoda is the largest, and the eastern one the smallest of the three.\" The eastern gate is flanked by griffins and other mythological figures, and in front stands a column of dark-coloured basalt, and of very light and elegant proportions, surmounted by a figure of the monkey-god Hanuman. This temple is dedicated to Krishna, considered as an avatar or incarnation of Vishnu, but is also held in joint tenancy by Balarama, identified with Siva or Mahadeo and Subhadra, regarded as his sister and also his consort in Hindoo mythology. Krishna is, however, the principal object of worship, and from his title Juggurnauth, the great temple is denominated. The three idols, intended to represent those three characters respectively, are three blocks of wood, each surmounted by a frightfully grim representation of the human countenance, the block, with the head, measuring about six feet in height. The block representing Krishna is painted dark blue, that representing Siva white, and Subhadra's yellow.\n\n* Jagannath, Lord of the Universe; from Jagan, \"the universe,\" and Nath, \"lord.\"\n\n\u2020 Wilson, Sanskrit Diet. in v. 337.\nJUGGURNAUTH.\n\nEach is provided with a rath or rude chariot, being a sort of lofty platform mounted on wheels. That of Juggurnauth is 43\u00bd feet high, 34\u00bd feet square, and is mounted on sixteen wheels, each 6\u00bd feet in diameter. The raths of the two other idols are of dimensions somewhat less. \"The grand festival occurs in the month of March,* when the moon is of a certain age, after the sun has entered Aries;\" and at the Rath Jatra, as this festival is denominated, the idols are taken on their raths to visit their country-house, about a mile and half distant. Thousands of men, women, and children, draw them along by means of cables fastened to the raths, and Brahmins stationed on the platforms sing and repeat obscene stories, accompanied by appropriately foul gestures, hailed by the multitudes with sounds and movements expressive of applause. Formerly, wretched fanatics offered up their lives in honour of the idols, by throwing themselves down before the moving wheels, which of course crushed them to death; but those horrible deeds have for some time ceased.\n\nThe British obtained possession of the place and temple in October, 1803; previously to which occupation, a tax had been levied by the Mahrattas upon the pilgrims resorting thither. This produced a very large sum, out of which a small one was assigned to defray the expenses of the temple. The priests made application to the British commissioner for the usual donation, which was at once granted; but the continuance of the pilgrim-tax was not contemplated. The priests, however, were anxious that the tax should be continued, inasmuch as the government might become tired of making a considerable donation at its own cost, while an accession of revenue from the temple would, it was thought, render the contribution to the priests more secure. The wish of these holy persons was complied with; the government donation was withdrawn, and the collection of money for the support of the temple permitted in substitution. In 1806 a change took place. The government took the superintendence of the temple upon itself, and laid down the most minute arrangements for its management. The pilgrim-tax thus became a regular source of revenue to the state. The measure was proposed before the retirement\n\n* Buchanan, however, states that, at the time of his visit, the Rath-jatra took place on the 18th of June.\nof the Marquis Wellesley, but he refused it his sanction. Sir George Barlow had no scruple on the subject, and under him the proposal became law; not, however, without a strong protest against it from one member of council, Mr. Udney. At home it was disapproved by the Court of Directors; but the president of the Board, Mr. Dundas, took a different view, and through his influence a despatch was framed, to the effect, that as the tax on pilgrims had been levied under Mahomedan and Mahratta governments, there did not appear any objection to its continuance under the British government. In 1889, under the administration of Lord Auckland, the subject came again under notice, when the tax was abolished, the expenses of the temple fixed at a certain sum, and a donation ordered to be paid from the public treasury, to make up the amount supposed to be required, and for which no other available means of providing existed. This donation somewhat exceeded 30,000 rupees. Subsequently, more careful inquiry was made, and the allowance was fixed at 23,000 rupees. This arrangement, however, was deemed objectionable, inasmuch as it did not disconnect the government from idolatrous worship. To effect this object, orders were recently sent out directing, as a final measure, that government should withdraw altogether from the temple, leaving it to be supported by its own resources, but making such compensation, if necessary, as should suffice to place the establishment in as good a pecuniary position as it enjoyed when the country passed into the hands of the British. According to a statement published a short time since, its condition in this respect is indeed much better. The pilgrim-tax, it may be mentioned, has never ceased, it having been collected by the native authorities after it was relinquished by the government. It is a circumstance for congratulation, that the government has thus purged itself from a foul scandal, which lowered its character and impaired its usefulness.\n\nHere, over a branch of the Mahanuddy, is an antique stone bridge, having eighteen waterways, not arched above, but traversed by \"laying horizontal tiers of stone on the piers, the one projecting slightly beyond the other, in the manner of inverted stairs, until they approach near enough at top to sustain a keystone or cross-beam.\" According to official\nreport, the town of Juggurnauth or Pooree contains 5,741 houses, which, if the usually-received ratio of five inmates to each house be applicable, would indicate a population of 29,705.

In the vicinity are numerous large tanks, and the soil being of redundant fertility, and teeming with rank vegetation, malaria for a part of the year prevails, diffusing the seeds of disease and death. Tunkaria, a village on the seacoast, 10 miles S.W. of Jumbooseer, is its seaport, through which considerable quantities of cotton, grain, coarse cloths, and the produce of the mowa (Bassia latifolia), are exported. The population of Jumbooseer is estimated at 10,000. Distance from Surat, N., 60 miles; Bombay, N., 212.

It rises at the south-western base of the group called the Jumnotri Peaks, at an elevation of 10,849\u00b2 feet, and in lat. 31\u00b0, long. 78\u00b0 32'. About 500 feet to the north-west of the hot spring of Jumnotri, the face of the mountain rises very steeply, and is entirely cased in snow and ice. From a rock which projects from the snow, a small rill descends during the daytime. It is about three feet wide, and very shallow, being only a shower of spray produced by the snow melted by the sun's rays, and is, according to Hodgson, the most remote source of the Jumna. This point was found inaccessible by that observer, the snow-bed being intersected by rents and chasms, caused by the falling in of the snow as it became melted by the steam of the boiling springs below it. The rill finds its way through chasms formed in the snow-bed to the ground beneath, out of which gush numerous springs of water of nearly boiling heat, and the steam from those, melting the mass of ice and snow above them, causes a copious shower, which affords the principal supply to the nascent Jumna. The stream holds a course generally south-westerly for about eight miles, when the Berai-Ganga, a stream which down to this point surpasses the Jumna in length and volume\u00b3 of water, joins it on the left side, in lat. 30\u00b0 56', long. 78\u00b0 27'. The declivity of the bed of the stream in this part of its course is enormous, as in a distance of sixteen miles, between its source and Kotnur, the fall is 5,086\u2074 feet, being at the rate of 314 feet to the mile. About five miles below this, and in lat. 30\u00b0 49', long. 78\u00b0 19', it receives on the right the Budeear, a great torrent, descending from the mountain Kedar-Kanta.\u2075 On the same side, about\n\n\u00b9 Hodgson and Herbert, ut supra, 327*.\n\u00b2 Hodgson and Herbert, ut supra, 327*.\n\u00b3 Jacquemont, ut supra, iv. 76, 92.\n\u2074 As. Res. xiv. 137\u2014Hodgson, Surv. of Ganges and Jumna.\n\u2075 Voyage, iv. 92.\n\n* Jacquemont\u00b9 states, that he ascended to the small cascade described by Hodgson, and saw the rill form, at a great distance to the north, another cascade. He visited the scene nearly a month later in the spring than Hodgson, and that interval would probably cause a great difference in the state of the snow.\nthree miles farther, the Bunal joins it, and, eight miles beyond, it is increased by the accession (also on the right side) of the Comalda, the largest of its tributaries above the Tonse. About four miles lower down, it receives the Rickna, and ten miles farther, the Khootnee, both on the right side. At the confluence with this last stream, and in lat. $30^\\circ 39'$, long. $78^\\circ 5'$, Hodgson found the Jumna, at the end of March, to be ninety feet wide, from three to five feet deep, rapid, and not fordable. About fifteen miles below this, it is joined on the left side by the Aglar or Agilwar, a considerable torrent. In addition to those above enumerated, numerous streams of less importance flow into the Jumna on both sides, between the source and this confluence. At the latter point, in lat. $30^\\circ 31'$, long. $78^\\circ 3'$, the course of the river, previously for the most part south-westerly, turns due west, which direction it keeps for thirteen miles, to the confluence of the Tonse, in lat. $30^\\circ 30'$, long. $77^\\circ 53'$, and at an elevation of 1,686 feet above the sea. The Tonse is by far the more considerable stream, its discharge being found, when surveyed by Hodgson and Herbert, to amount to 2,827 cubic feet in a second of time, whilst that of the Jumna was only 1,045. About ten miles farther down, on the same side, the Jumna receives the Girree, a small river, discharging 100 cubic feet in a second. At Raj Ghat, immediately below this confluence, Moorcroft describes the river as being 100 feet wide in the middle of February. Garden, however, assigns it greater dimensions here: according to that authority, the channel of the river is 600 yards wide, and the stream usually about 100 during the dry season, clear, deep, and rapid. A mile below this place, it receives on the left side, and at an elevation of 1,470 feet, the Asun, flowing from the south-east, and draining or irrigating the western part of the Dehra Doon. Taking from this point a direction first westerly, then southerly, it flows through a ravine in the Sewalik Mountains, and about twelve miles below the confluence of the Asun, at Badshamahal, in lat. $30^\\circ 20'$, long. $77^\\circ 38'$, enters the plain of Hindostan. Herbert estimates the length of course, from the source of the Jumna to this place, at 123 miles, its elevation here at 1,276 feet, its discharge, at the beginning of March, at the rate of 4,000 cubic feet in a second. This assigned length of course, however,\nJUMNA.\n\nappears too great, the actual course being only about ninety-seven miles. Thus the fall from the source to this place is about 100 feet per mile. In the vicinity of Badshahmahal,\u2020 the Jumna divides into several\u2021 branches, and on its right side a canal was, in the year 1856, dug by Feroz Toghluk,\u2020 king of Delhi. At about eighty miles from the commencement of this canal, the canal of Ali Mardan Khan parted from it, and, taking a southerly direction, made its way to Delhi. This work appears to have been maintained in a state of efficiency till 1760; but in the canal of Feroz Shah the water ceased to flow at Suffeedon in 1740. The restoration of the Delhi Canal engaged at an early period the attention of the marquis of Hastings. In 1817, operations were commenced, and by the end of May, 1820, the water was brought to the city of Delhi, and, passing through the main conduit in the palace, rejoined its parent stream. The supply is drawn from a point in the vicinity of Chooarpore, and conducted along a natural channel to Jhyadri, thence by a new cut into the river Outralla, which it follows to its junction with the river Soumb; and, passing through this last-named river, is carried on, vid Dadoopur,\n\n* This statement is derived from the trigonometrical survey.\n\n\u2020 The following description of the entrance of the Jumna into the plains is given by Hamilton; but as it is his practice to give only a general list of authorities, without specifying the particular parts of an article which they are adduced to support, it is not possible to assign those applicable to the passage here quoted:\u2014\u201cThe Jumna issues from the mountains in the province of Delhi, near the small village of Fyzabad, about twenty-six miles north of Saharunpoor. The hills come close to the right bank of the river, immediately opposite to this village, but on the right [qy. left] bank they are distant about three miles. The river here is deep in its bed, which is about 1,000 yards broad, and in the wet monsoon rolls down a prodigious quantity of water, but in the dry season its stream is not above 100 yards broad. A short distance below Fyzabad, the Jumna separates into several channels, but chiefly into two considerable branches, which meet again below Booraghaut, at a distance of eighteen miles, forming an extensive island, well inhabited and cultivated. Over the above space its bottom is sand and gravel, with frequent rapids, which admit, however, of small timber-rafts being floated, which are afterwards taken to pieces, and formed into large ones.\u201d\n\n\u2021 Davidson crossed the Jumna about twenty miles below Badshahmahal; and though the volume of water is diverted to the canal of Feroz Shah, and to that of the Doab, he describes the main stream (17th April) as \u201c300 yards wide, twenty feet deep, with a strong current.\u201d\nJUMNA.\n\nKurnaul, Rair, and Boanuh, to Delhi; its total length being 185 miles. In 1823, the restoration of the Feroz Shah Canal, passing by Hansi and Hisar, was commenced. The two canals having one common head, the work consisted in the clearance of the old line from Rair to Bahaderah, 151 miles; the construction of a branch to Rohtuk, forty-five miles long; of another in the direction of Darbah, thirty-two miles; and of the new supply-head, twelve miles; making a total of 240 miles. The water was turned down the canal in 1825. The restoration of the Dooab Canal, parting from the eastern bank of the Jumna near the village of Fyzabad, and rejoining the parent stream opposite the city of Delhi, was commenced in 1824, and the works were completed in 1830. \"The original and almost sole object of the government in undertaking these works, appears to have been to convey a large supply of water from the Jumna for the purposes of irrigation of the crops\u20141st, on lines of country where the natural depth of wells was so great as to render the cost of irrigation from them so heavy as to impede the improvement of the districts, as on the Delhi Canal; 2nd, to supply the means of cheap and easy irrigation to the districts, as on the Dooab Canal, where, although the wells are not so deep, the irrigation from the canal would be comparatively cheap and easy; and, 3rd, as on Feroz's canal, to confer the means of irrigation on districts where, from the excessive depth of the wells, none was heretofore in use, and to convey a supply of wholesome water to a country where generally it is brackish or salt.\"\n\nFrom Badshamahal to the point of reunion with the Delhi Canal, a distance of 145 miles, generally in a southerly direction, the Jumna is occasionally available for floating rafts of timber cut in the Sewalik Mountains; though even that rude kind of navigation is attended with danger during inundation, and in hot weather with delay. In addition to the works above enumerated, the construction of a canal from the Jumna, at a point about five miles east of Kurnaul, to the Sutlej at Loodiana, has been suggested, and a survey of the line of level made, the result of which appears favourable to the plan.\n\nAt Delhi, the river is crossed during the dry season by a bridge of boats, constructed every year at the cessation of the rains. From that city, the course turns a little to the east;\nbut though in many places extraordinarily circuitous, it holds generally a south-easterly direction to its confluence with the Ganges at Allahabad, a distance from Delhi, by the river's course, of 619 miles. Between Delhi and Allahabad, the Jumna receives on the right side the following rivers:\u2014The Baun or Ootunghun, in lat. 26\u00b0 59', long. 78\u00b0 31'; the Chumbul, in lat. 26\u00b0 30', long. 79\u00b0 19'; the Sind, eight miles below; the Betwa,4 in lat. 25\u00b0 55', long. 80\u00b0 17'; the Cane, in lat. 25\u00b0 47', long. 80\u00b0 35', all considerable streams; besides some others of less importance. The chief streams which fall in on the left side are, the Hindon, in lat. 28\u00b0 28', long. 77\u00b0 30'; the Seengoor, in lat. 26\u00b0 9', long. 79\u00b0 59'; the Rind, in lat. 25\u00b0 53', long. 80\u00b0 37'. Jacquemont5 styles the Jumna in the lower part of its course an enormous river: in the rainy season, it is in some places a mile, in others several miles, in width, and with a very rapid current. In consequence, however, of its bed being obstructed by shoals and rocks, navigation was not practicable for craft above Delhi, except by means of the canal. Prinsep6 thus speaks of the Jumna:\u2014\n\n\"That river, although of greater length than the Ganges above their confluence, yet much inferior to it in the average volume of its discharge, is the line of communication with some of the principal commercial marts and military stations in India,\u2014Calpee, Etawah, Muttra, and the cities of Agra and Delhi, all situated upon its banks, and with the distant post of Kurnaul, by the ancient canal branching off at Delhi, which has been lately repaired and re-opened. Its banks are lofty and precipitous, and ridges of rock in many places advance into the stream, combining with its general shallowness and strong current to render navigation extremely difficult and dangerous.\" Much has, however, been done to remedy this inconvenience. At Kurinkhan, near Oryah, lat. 26\u00b0 26', long. 79\u00b0 35', the whole bed was formerly interspersed with kankar rocks, abounding with organic7 remains and huge blocks of sandstone,8 which rendered the navigation so intricate and dangerous, that great numbers of boats were lost, and others delayed for several weeks; but those obstacles have, for the most part, been removed by blasting or other means, and a dam made to deepen and give permanence to the channel: other improvements9 have been effected, and the practicability of navigating by\nJUMNOTRI.\n\nsteam the river below Calpee has been established. The Jumna contains crocodiles or alligators in the lower part of its course. The total length of the river, from its source to its confluence with the Ganges at Allahabad, is 860 miles. On the rocky point where the waters meet, stands the fort of Allahabad. The streams at the junction are nearly equal in volume; the Ganges, the deeper, with yellow water; the Jumna, the more rapid, with water as clear as crystal, but considered less palatable and wholesome than that of its fellow. The Jumna* or Yamuna is by the Hindoos considered sacred, and its confluence with the still more sacred Ganges is dignified by a legend, according to which the Sarasvati or Sursuti, a stream that is lost in the wilds of Sirhind, flows underground to Allahabad, where it oozes from under one of the towers,\u2020 and mingles its water with those of the other two rivers. Hence this confluence is called Tri-veni, or \"three plaited locks.\"\n\nJUMNOTRI,\u2020 a collection of hot springs near the source of the Jumna, is situate at the western base of the most western of three closely-adjoining mountains, styled in the trigonometrical survey the Jumnotri Peaks. The mountain-mass formed by this collection of peaks bears the common name of Banderpuch.\u2021 Fraser,\u00a7 who viewed it from the south-west,\n\n* Wilford describes it as \"the blue Yamuna or Calindi, the daughter of the sun, the sister of the last Manu, and also of Yama or Samana, our Pluto or Summanus.\" \u00b9\n\n\u2020 Skinner \u00b9 describes the precise spot where, according to the superstitious Hindoos, the Sarasvati reappears:\u2014\"I descended a species of cave within the fort by a flight of steps, to a dark narrow passage, at the end of which is the trunk of a tree still alive, although the air is quite excluded; and the rock which finishes the cave is moist with water, which the people believe arises from the course of the Seeraswattee, the mysterious river.\"\n\n\u2021 Benderpuch, according to Fraser, signifies \"monkey's tail.\" The name, therefore, should properly be Bandarpunchh; from Bandar, \"a monkey,\" and Punchh, \"a tail.\" According to Fraser,\u00b9 the local tradition is, that Hanuman, the monkey-god, \"after his conquest of Lanka or Ceylon, when he had set that island on fire, by means of a quantity of combustible matter tied to his tail, being afraid of the flame reaching and consuming himself, was about to dip this inflamed tail in the sea, to extinguish it, but the sea remonstrated with him, on account of the probable consequences to the numerous inhabitants of its waters, whereupon Hanuman plunged it in this lake, which ever since has retained the name.\"\n\n\u00b9 As.

Little or no rock is seen, except at a few points in the ridge connecting the peaks, where it is too sharp and steep for snow to lie; and here it appears of a red colour. Here and there lofty precipices are observed in the snow itself, where the lower parts have melted, and the upper masses have given way, sliding down the ravines below, leaving a face of snow of several hundred feet high, and showing the depth of that which has accumulated for ages.\"\n\nAccording to native report, Banderpuch has four peaks, situate around a lake, in which Hanuman, the monkey-god, extinguished his flaming tail. In the trigonometrical survey, three peaks are laid down, having the respective heights and technical names,\u2014Black E. 21,155 feet, Great E. 20,916, Lower E. 20,122. The group of hot springs is about 500 yards from the spot where the first water of the Jumna, a small rill, shoots over the brow of a rock projecting from the perennial and unexplored snows which overspread the summit of Banderpuch. The stream quickly finds its way through the mass of snow lying beneath the precipice, and having a thickness of forty feet, and runs beneath it close to the hot springs, receiving the water flowing from them. The steam of the springs melts the lower part of the mass of snow, so as to form a number of excavations, resembling vaulted roofs of marble; and from these incessant showers fall, which yield the principal supply to the nascent Jumna. The hot springs are numerous and extensive, and the water bursts up in them with great ebullition through a granite rock, and deposits a ferruginous sediment. It is devoid of taste and smell, and has a temperature of 194\u00b07', nearly that of boiling water at that elevation, which is 10,849 feet above the sea.

The fort was seized by the Sikhs in 1837, and an attempt of the Afghans to retake it led to a battle, in which the Sikhs were defeated, and their general, Hari Singh, an officer of high reputation, slain. Previous to the acquisition of the Punjab by the British, the Sikhs strengthened their position by building the fort of Futighur, on the east side of Jumrood. The place is 1,670 feet above the sea.

The site is beautiful and advantageous, commanding the navigation of the river in both a military and commercial point of view. Here the rude tribes of the neighbouring part of Beloochistan come to supply themselves with manufactured wares. The advantageous position and salubrious air of Jurruk caused it to be recommended by Burnes as the best location for a British settlement in this part of Sinde. The principal manufacture is turnery of a very tasteful and highly-finished kind. Its population is probably about 1,500 or 2,000.\u00b2 Lat. 26\u00b0 3', long. 68\u00b0 20'.\n\nJUSHPORE, or JUGDESPORE.\u00b9\u2014A small raj included within the territory superintended by the Governor-General's political agent for the south-west frontier of Bengal.

The country is a high table-land, much overrun with jungle, but was recently found by the British agent to be improving under the government of the native chief, represented as far surpassing the majority of his class in intelligence and attention. The people appear happier than in many other parts of the political agency. Rice, grain, and oil, are the staple productions. Lak and wild silk are abundant where cultivation has not subjugated the jungle. The country is computed to yield a revenue of 10,000 rupees. The population is estimated at upwards of 27,000.\u00b2\n\nJUSHPOOR.\u2014A town in the native state of Jushpoor, on the south-west frontier of Bengal, 98 miles N. from Sumbulpoor, and 73 miles S.W. from Lohadugga.

It is situate at the northern base of a small conical hill about 200 feet high, on the upper part of the rocky side of which was the residence of the thakoor or chief. There was formerly a bazar, containing 800 shops built of stone, and the town was surrounded by a wall of the same material; but those, as well as the greater part of the private houses, are now in ruins, in consequence of the fury of inveterate private feuds, under the influence of which the population of the vicinity are intent on mutual destruction. The river Loonee, abreast of this place, was, when ferried over by Boileau in the rainy season, at the beginning of July, 700 yards wide, and running with a very violent current. The town in the time of its prosperity contained 8,000 houses; but not a tenth of that number are now inhabited. The road in this part of the route between Balmeer and the town of Joudpore is under water during the rainy season, and unsafe. Lat. 25\u00b0 47', long. 72\u00b0 23'.\n\nJUSPOOR, in the British district of Moradabad, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a town on the route from Pilleebheet to Suharunpoor, and 100 miles S.W. of the former. It is situate near the southern boundary of the Terai or marshy forest extending along the base of the mountain, and in lat. 29\u00b0 17', long. 78\u00b0 53'.\n\nJUSSO, in Bundelcund, a town, the principal place of a jaghire or feudal possession of the same name, containing an area of 180 square miles, with a population of 24,000. The revenue of the raj is returned at 1,300l. per annum, and the chief maintains a small military force. The town is distant 26 miles S.E. of Punnah. Lat. 24\u00b0 27', long. 80\u00b0 35'.\n\nJUSTWUNTNUGUR, in the British district of Etawa, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a small town on the route from the cantonment of Agra to that of Etawa, and nine miles N.W. of the latter. It has a mosque and a small bazar, and supplies may be obtained from the surrounding country. The road in this part of the route is generally good;\nJUT.\n\nthe country cultivated, and studded with small villages. The population of the town is returned at 5,033. Lat. 26\u00b0 58', long. 78\u00b0 58'.\n\nJUTEPOOR, in the British district of Bareilly, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a village on the route from Bareilly to Petoragarh, and 26 miles N.E. of the former. The road in this part of the route is bad, and in the rainy season in many places laid underwater. The country is level, open, fertile, and cultivated. Lat. 28\u00b0 37', long. 79\u00b0 47'.\n\nJUTPOOL.\u2014A town in the native state of Hyderabad, or dominions of the Nizam, 94 miles S. by W. from Hyderabad, and 18 miles N.E. from Kurnool. Lat. 16\u00b0 1', long. 78\u00b0 16'.\n\nJUTPOORA, in the British district of Moradabad, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, a village on the route from Allygurh to the town of Moradabad, and six miles S.W. of the latter. The road in this part of the route is good; the country open, level, and cultivated. Lat. 28\u00b0 46', long. 78\u00b0 47'.\n\nJUTT.\u2014A town in the Sattara jaghire of Jutt, 95 miles N.E. from Belgaum, and 136 miles S.E. by S. from Poonah. The jaghiredar is bound to furnish a contingent of cavalry to its feudal superior, the British government. A proposal made by the latter for a commutation of the obligation by a pecuniary payment, was met by refusal on the part of the chief. Lat. 17\u00b0 1', long. 75\u00b0 16'.\n\nJUTTA KA GOTE, in Sinde, a village on the route from Tatta to Hydrabad, by way of Kotree, and 17 miles N.E. of Tatta. It is situate a mile and a half from the right bank of the Indus, and half-way between that river and the brackish Dund, or lake of Kunjur. The adjacent country is plain, and occupied principally by a shikargah or hunting-ground, lately belonging to one of the ameers of Hydrabad. Lat. 24\u00b0 56', long. 68\u00b0 12'.\n\nJUTTEEL MOUNTAINS, in Sinde, form a portion of that mountain system which, stretching eastward from the great Hala range, terminates abruptly on the right bank of the Indus, near Sehwan. The Juteel Mountains run south-west from Sehwan to Dooba, a distance of between sixty and seventy miles. They are steep and of considerable height, probably in few places less than 2,000 feet. The direct road from Sehwan\nto Kurrachee lies between them and the Keertar range, which is equally high, and holds a parallel course, but more to the west. The Jutteel range extends between lat. $25^\\circ 32'$\u2014$26^\\circ 20'$, and long. $67^\\circ 48'$\u2014$68^\\circ 8'$.\n\n**JUTTOO**, in the Punjab, a village on the route from Mooltan to Dera Ismael Khan, and 18 miles N.W. of the former town. It is situate 10 miles from the right bank of the Chenaub river, in what Elphinstone calls the Little Desert, extending between the Chenaub and the Indus, and which he describes as having a length of 250 miles from north to south, and, in the latitude of Juttoo, a breadth of two days' march, or about forty miles. It is a dreary tract, ill supplied with brackish water, and overspread with sandhills of a grey colour, among which the only vegetation is a scanty growth of stunted bushes. Lat. $30^\\circ 20'$, long. $71^\\circ 17'$.\n\n**JUWAHIR**, or **JUWAR**, in the British district of Kumaon, lieutenant-governorship of the North-West Provinces, the most considerable of the Bhotia mehals or subdivisions north of the culminating ridge of the Himalaya. It comprises the upper part of the valley drained by the river Goree, together with the lofty mountains rising on each side, and ranges between lat. $30^\\circ 10'$\u2014$30^\\circ 35'$, long. $79^\\circ 50'$\u2014$80^\\circ 20'$. The surface throughout has great elevation, the lowest part affording passage to the river Goree, over the southern frontier, at Leepookee Than, in lat. $30^\\circ 10'$, long. $80^\\circ 17'$, at an elevation of 9,152 feet above the sea; the head of the Goonka, its remotest feeder, being at the Oota Dhoora Pass into Hiundes, and at an elevation probably of not less than 15,000 feet. The valley drained by the river, extending between these places, is the habitable part of Juwahir; the more elevated tracts, rising on the east and west, being unexplored wastes of perennial snow. Therein are summits of extraordinary height, some rising 22,000, some 23,000, feet above the level of the sea; and one, called Nanda Devi, reaching 25,749. At the fall of the year, the whole surface of the country becomes covered with deep snow, which commences early in October, when the inhabitants migrate to the more southern, lower, and warmer parts of Kumaon. The accumulation is progressive to the beginning of April, and snow continues to fall until late in May. The depth, in open and level situations, varies in different years.\nJUWAHIR.\n\nfrom six to twelve feet, and is wholly dissipated by the first week in June; but in confined and much-depressed places, successive avalanches sometimes cause accumulations several hundred feet thick, and in many deep valleys and ravines the whole is not melted until late in July. Webb, in the beginning of June, found an accumulation 250 feet in perpendicular depth in the bottom of a valley, where the further progress of avalanches from the inclosing mountains was arrested. At an elevation of 11,568 feet above the level of the sea, the head-water of the river Goree flows from the base of this mass, which never quite melts, though, towards the close of the periodical rains, the side, midway up the mountain, becomes divested of snow, and yields a very scanty pasture to goats. The upper extremity of the valley, however, is never free from snow, and in consequence the route northwards to Hiundes proceeds up the course of the Goonka, a tributary to the Goree, rising in the Oota Dhoora Pass, where the valley or gorge of Juwahir debouches on the table-land of Hiundes. There is no account of any European having explored that pass, nor any evidence that it is ever free from snow. In the beginning of June, Webb found that, upwards from Milum, having an elevation of 11,430 feet above the sea, the river and the whole country was under deep snow, precluding the traveller's farther progress to the pass, still distant fifteen miles, and approachable only by a very bad road. He was informed by the natives, that the ascent of the pass itself was performed in sixteen or eighteen hours by loaded sheep and goats. According to Traill, the thermometer ranges, during summer at sunrise, from $40^\\circ$ to $55^\\circ$; at noon, from $65^\\circ$ to $75^\\circ$ in the shade, from $90^\\circ$ to $110^\\circ$ in the sunshine. Towards the middle of August, the temperature becomes precarious, and the weather subject to sudden and severe changes, which the natives suppose are accelerated by any concussion in the air, such as that produced by discharge of firearms or loud musical instruments; and much precaution is observed to prevent the occurrence of such concussions. Heavy rains sometimes fall: Webb, during his visit in the beginning of June, found them to continue for seven nights and six days without intermission. The scanty cultivation produces barley, amaranthus, wheat and buckwheat, leeks, and turnips. Buckwheat is found wild every-\n\nUt supra, 7.\nwhere; celery, garlic, and rhubarb also grow wild. The crops of wheat and amaranthus are in general poor, and sometimes completely fail, in consequence of the ungenial climate. The indigenous fruits are gooseberries, red and white currants, raspberries, pears, and strawberries. The culture of peaches and apricots is attempted, but the produce is very poor. In the least-elevated parts, the deodar or Himalayan cedar, and the suryi or arbor vitae, attain frequently a girth of twenty-five feet. The other trees are, various kinds of pines and rhododendrons, birches, junipers; the usual shrubs are, ground-cypress, roses, and sweetbrier. Flowers are plentiful, especially iris and anemone. The sura gai or yak is much esteemed as a beast of burthen, on account of its strength and sureness of foot in difficult paths; and still more valuable are the hybrids between this animal and common kine. Where the sire is a yak, the hybrid is called jabbu; if the cross be of the opposite kind, the hybrid is called garjo. Goats and sheep are the most general beasts of burthen, the former carrying from twelve to twenty-four pounds, the latter from ten to sixteen. These animals journey on an average a distance of five miles daily, being allowed to remain stationary for the greater part of the day for pasture, which affords their only means of subsistence. The inhabitants of Juwahir are supported by the traffic between Hiundes and the countries to the south. The more wealthy, having command of capital, combine commercial speculations in both quarters with the carrying-business, which forms the main resource of the less opulent. The inhabitants of Juwahir are favoured by the Tibetan authorities, in being allowed access to all parts of Tibet, while the other Bhotias of Kumaon are restricted to particular places for trade. They take into Hiundes grain, cottons, broadcloths, hardware, glassware, wooden vessels, coral, pearls, dye-stuffs, spices, sugar, sugarcandy, and timber; and bring back gold-dust, salt, borax, sheep\u2019s-wool, goat\u2019s-wool or shawl-wool, chauries or yak-tails, coarse shawls, inferior silks, leather tanned in a similar manner to the Russian, dried fruits, and drugs. The Juwaharis are of Tibetan descent, and exhibit the singular anomaly of yielding allegiance both to the mother country and to the government of Kumaon; the latter enforced by military power, the former by the influence resulting from commercial relations. Their\nreligion is a medley of Lamaism and of Brahminism, administered indifferently, according to exigency, by the priests of either faith. They affect the same scruples as the Brahmins with respect to food, and have assumed the designation\\(^2\\) of 'Sinh (lion), but are regarded by the Brahminists with abhorrence, as the descendants of a kine-killing race. The Tibetan language has died away and been replaced by the Hindoostanee, now universally used in Juwahir.\\(^3\\) The people are represented by Traill\\(^4\\) as an honest, industrious, orderly race, patient and good-humoured, but very filthy in their habits, using the skirts of their dress to scrub both their persons and cooking-utensils.\n\nUnder the Goorkha sway, the tribute levied was oppressively large. This arose not entirely from fiscal, but partly from vindictive motives, the Juwahirs having frequently baffled the military efforts made to reduce them to submission. Juwahir comprises thirteen villages and 455 houses;\\(^5\\) and if six be taken as the average for the number of inmates of each, the result would be a population of 2,780.\n\n**JWALA MUKHI.**\u2014See **JEWALA MUKI.**\n\n**JWITEE.**\u2014A town in the hill zemindary of Jeypoor, presidency of Madras, four miles E.N.E. from Jeypoor, and 91 miles N.W. from Vizianagrum.

A pension of 50l. a month was assigned for his support, and he retired to Dacca. The forfeited possessions were annexed\\(^4\\) to the British dominions; those situated in the plains being incorporated with the district of Sylhet,\\(^5\\) and the remainder (forming the subject of this article) being placed under the jurisdiction of the political agent in the Cossya Hills.

The former meeting with a well-conducted resistance, and suffering severe loss, fled panic-struck to camp; the other made good a lodgment in an important position near the fort; but being called off by General Martindell, who commanded the army of which the detachment formed part, it was harassed greatly on its retreat, and narrowly escaped total destruction. The loss to both detachments amounted to four officers killed, and five wounded; seventy-nine non-commissioned officers and privates killed, and 281 wounded and missing. On the 13th of March following, two eighteen-pounder battering-guns were with great difficulty hauled by hand up the nearly perpendicular side of the ridge, and placed in battery against the fort, besides two six-pounders, two eight-and-half-inch mortars, and two five-and-half-inch howitzers. The defences of the Goorkhas were in consequence much damaged, and in a short time the British posts were so arranged as completely to blockade the fort, which, early in May, was surrendered, but not till the stock of provisions for the use of the garrison was reduced to one day's rations. Nearly 1,500 armed men marched out, besides about 1,000 women and children. Jytuk is 4,854 feet above the sea. Distant N.W. from Calcutta 1,014 miles, by Dehra.
