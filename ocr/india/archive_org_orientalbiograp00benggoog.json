R. A. S.\n\nA FELLOW OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALCUTTA; AUTHOR OF THE TURKS IN INDIA, ETC.\n\nCALCUTTA:\n\nPRINTED BY J. W. THOMAS, BAPTIST MISSION PRESS.\n\nPUBLISHED BY THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY, 57 PARK STREET.\n\n1881.\nPREFATORY NOTICE.\n\nThe author of this Dictionary was formerly a Clerk in the office of the Board of Revenue, N. W. P. at a time when the Secretary was Henry Myers Elliot, afterwards well known as Sir H. M. Elliot, K. C. B. It is probable that, in preparing his extracts from the Mohamadan Histories of India, Elliot availed himself of the aid of Mr. Beale, of whose scholarship Prof. Dowson makes justly deserved mention in the eighth volume of his valuable edition of the work.* Mr. Beale died at a very advanced age in the summer of 1875, having before his death expressed a wish that I would see his MS. through the press, and reduce the transliteration into conformity with the system then recently adopted by the Government of India, and founded (as I need hardly observe) upon the system of Sir W. Jones.\n\nAccordingly, on the 5th October of that year I laid the MS. before Sir John Strachey, the then Lieut.-Governor, in the name of the Archaeological Society of Agra, of which he was a Vice-Patron, in a letter from which the following is an extract:\n\n\"This is no ordinary book. I have used it as a work of reference, for years: and have lately had an opportunity of showing it to the eminent scholar Mr. E. B. Eastwick, C. B. who, I am authorised to say, concurs with me in thinking that the Dictionary will be of unique value to oriental students.\"\n\nSir J. Strachey took up the subject with that enlightened energy which always actuated him in dealing with the past history of the country over whose administration he then presided. The MS. and copyright were acquired at the expense of Government; and it was ultimately resolved\u2014in view of the importance of the work and my own official occupations\u2014that the editing should be entrusted to the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nThe Society confided the labour of seeing the Dictionary though the press to their Philological Secretary, Principal Blochmann, of whose qualifications it would be presumptuous to say more than that they have an eccumenical reputation. That distinguished man (of whom it has been observed by Count v. Noer that he united the enthusiasm of an artist to the most patient accuracy of research\u2020) undertook the task with his characteristic earnestness and ability. But unhappily for oriental scholarship Mr. Blochmann's lamented death occurred before he had completed the preparation of more than a few sheets; and the duty ultimately reverted to the local Archaeological Society of Agra.\n\nBeing soon after transferred from Agra, and being besides prevented by my public duties from giving to the Dictionary the full attention which its importance required, I have availed to a great degree of the aid of my colleagues, Mr. S\u00e1yad Mahmood, Prof. A. Thomson, and L\u00e1la Bah\u00e1l Rai. I have also (in the latter sheets particularly) had valuable help from Dr. Hoernle, Philological Secretary of the Society. To these gentlemen, and to the Superintendent of the Baptist Mission Press the work is indebted for its handsome and practical appearance and character.\n\nThe substance is almost entirely Mr. Beale's; and I cannot close this notice more fitly than by giving the following extracts from the preface originally drafted by himself:\n\n\"In preparing a work of this nature, intended to be used as a work of reference on matters connected with Oriental History, it is proper to state that the greatest care has been taken to ensure accuracy in the narrative, as also in the dates of births, deaths, and other events recorded...Various MSS. have been collated whenever discrepancy was observed...To remove all doubt, chronograms indicating the dates with a certainty not to be found by any other method and written when the events were fresh in the minds of men, have been inserted, when available.\"\n\n* The History of India, by its own Historians. Tr\u00fcbner & Co. 1877.\n\u2020 Kaiser Akbar. Leyden, 1880.\nI may here add that it has been judged expedient to omit these chronograms, for the most part, in printing the book. In the chapter of Mr. Dowson's book already cited, will be found an account of this species of memoria technica. But it is chiefly interesting as machinery for producing a certain result; and when the result has been produced is not of much more use than the scaffolding of a building when the building is complete.\n\n\"The materials collected in this Biography are only from those works which were within the reach of the author, and therefore it is to be considered as a nucleus to which those who have access to other sources may add new materials.\n\n\"It may also be proper to add, that the difficulties and embarrassment which a writer of such a work is liable to meet with is so great, (I quote here the words of a learned gentleman) 'that though of a minor order, comprehends in itself such a number of annoyances that the writer of it, even if he had none other to make head against, might feel tempted to abandon his pen in despair when considering it.'\n\n\"'In the East' says he, 'there are but a few proper names of individuals. Abdullah, Al\u00ed, Hasan, Hussain, Muhammad, for example, are common to thousands. To remedy the inconvenience that might be supposed to result from this tendency to homogenousness, the Orientals annex to the family-name of the chronicled person, 1, a Kunia, or surname taken from the name of his eldest son, as Abu Muhammad (father of Muhammad); Ab\u00fa'l Hasan (father of Hasan); 2, the name of his father and often the name of his grandfather; 3, a name taken from his place of residence; 4, a name taken from his birthplace; 5, an honorary title, chiefly appended to the name of K\u00e1z\u00eds, Sheiks and Im\u00e1ms, Monks and Doctors, as Bah\u00e1udd\u00edn (Splendour of Religion), Jal\u00e1ludd\u00edn (Glory of Religion), T\u00e1judd\u00edn (Crown of Religion); and in the order of this nomenclature, the last name is put first. Thus to designate aright the famous physician Abdul Lat\u00edf, we must call him Muwaffikudd\u00edn Abu Muhammad Abdul Lat\u00edf bin Yusaf Monsal\u00ed Baghd\u00e1di, viz., The Protector of Religion, father of Muhammad, Abdul Lat\u00edf, son of Joseph, living at Monsal, born at Baghdad. Yet this is by no means an exaggerated specimen; several other surnames of the same kind are frequently added. The perpetual recurrence of such a multiplicity of names and titles must tend in many ways to confuse a literary historian; and the more naturally when he finds the same individual chronicled in one page under his honorary title only, as Jal\u00e1ludd\u00edn, in another under his family-name, as Abdur Rahm\u00e1n, in the third under his father's name as Ibn Arabsh\u00e1h, somewhere else under the name of his sons, as Ab\u00fa'l Abb\u00e1s, and perhaps again, and where one would least look for it, under the name of his native province, Sh\u00e1hr\u00edst\u00e1n. D'Herbelot has recorded no fewer than fourteen Persian writers, all of whom pass, under the common cognomen of Karam\u00e1n\u00ed, from their province Karam\u00e1n. Here is perspicuity! But this is not all. The transcribers of the MSS. have frequently confounded the title Ab\u00fa and Ibn, or else for abbreviation sake, have omitted them altogether and written down Abdullah, or Abdur Rahm\u00e1n, him who was in fact the father or the son of Abdullah or Abdur Rahm\u00e1n. Then there are a great many authors whom public celebrity has been accustomed to distinguish so exclusively by one only of their adjunctive titles, that even the native biographers find it impossible to trace either their family-names or their surnames. Lastly, many hundreds of books bear the same name, and the names of most books are conceived after such a many-worded and no-meaninged fashion, that de Sacy, Schlegel, Casiri and von Hammer, to mention but a few investigators out of many, have been foiled in the attempt to establish their signification.'\n\n\"To prevent such confusion and difficulties, the author has taken care to insert each individual under his different appellations, viz., under his family-name, his surname, poetical name, under his title or under the name of the place of his birth, referring at the same time, if he is not to be found under one name, to look under the one referred to.\n\n\"In conclusion the author begs to add that most part of the materials collected in this volume were procured by the assistance of his son the late lamented Mr. J. W. Beale, 2nd Master of the Bareily College who was murdered by the insurgents on the 3rd June 1857 at that station, and since he is now no more, the author is obliged to drop his pen; but earnestly hopes that this work which is nearly the first of its kind in India, and the want of which has already been much felt, may prove useful to the Student, the Scholar, the Historian, and the general reader.\"\n\nThis notice may well terminate with a repetition of this hope: and with an appeal to scholars of larger leisure and opportunities for an indulgent treatment of a work produced by\na man who had never been in Europe nor enjoyed the use of a complete Library. Mr. Beale had drawn up a list of more than thirty books in various languages which had furnished him with materials. In addition the editors have from time to time referred to the translation of the *Ain Akbari* and its invaluable notes by Mr. Blochmann, of which the 1st Volume (never, alas, continued) was published in Calcutta some years ago.\n\nOne word more as to the inexhaustible subject of transliteration. The English as is well known have three methods; the Haphazard (which indeed is no method at all), the Gilchristian, and the popularised Jonesian introduced by the Government of India under the inspiration of Mr. W. W. Hunter. None of these is quite satisfactory. The French adopt a system of their own, and so do the Germans. Mr. Beale had followed an orthography, compounded of the two first-named elements, which has been to some extent modified in printing these pages. For the convenience of Continental European scholars the names have also been printed in the Persian character; and it is hoped that no practical difficulty will be experienced by those who may have occasion to use the Dictionary.\n\nH.

(Rabi'-ne-Sani 663 A.H.), and was crowned on Friday the 19th June following (3rd Ramazan.) He was a prince who added to the qualifications of courage and wisdom those of moderation, clemency, and justice. His ambassadors were introduced in 1274 to the ecclesiastical Synod at Lyons. He proved to be a formidable neighbour to the Christians who settled at Jerusalem. The intrigues of his court embittered the latter years of his reign; and his days were belied by many to have been shortened by poison given to him by his minister Khwaja Shamsuddin Muhammad, which occasioned his death on Wednesday the 1st of April 1282 A.D., (20th Zil-hijja 680 A.H.) after a reign of 17 years and some months. He had married the daughter of Michael Paleologus, emperor of Constantinople, who had been betrothed to his father, but arrived at Maragha in Tabriz, the seat of his government, after the death of that prince. Abu-khan was succeeded by his brother Nekodar, who embraced Muhammadanism, and took the title of Ahmad Khan.\n\n'Abbas, (\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633) the son of Abdul-Mutalib, and uncle of the prophet Muhammad. He at first opposed the ambitious views of his nephew, but when defeated in the battle of Badr, he was reconciled to him, warmly embraced his religion, and thanked heaven for the prosperity and the grace which he enjoyed as a Musalman. He served the cause of Muhammad at the battle of Hunain by recalling his dismayed troops to the charge, and inciting them boldly to rally round their prophet, who was near expiring under the scimitars of the Sakanites. He died on the 21st February, 663 A.D. (17th Rajab, 32 A.H.); and 100 lunar years after, Abul-'Abbas, surnamed As-Saffah, one of his descendants, laid the foundation of the 'Abbasid or Abbaside family of the Caliphs in Baghdad, which continued for 524 lunar years. The tomb of 'Abbas is in Madina.\n\n'Abbas, (\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633) a sister of Harun-ur-Rashid, the Khalifa of Baghdad, who bestowed her hand on Ja'far Barmaki, his minister, on condition that she abstained from the marriage rights. The promise was forgotten, and the husband's life was sacrificed by the tyrant, and 'Abbas was reduced to poverty. This circumstance took place in 803 A.D. (187 A.H.). There are still extant some Arabic verses which beautifully celebrate her love and her misfortunes. See Ja'far ul-Barmaki.\n\nAbba\n\n'Abbas Ali, (\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0639\u0644\u064a) a physician, and one of the Persian magi, who followed the doctrines of Zoroaster. He wrote A.D. 980, a book called 'Royal Work', at the request of the son of the reigning Khalifa of Baghdad, to whom it was dedicated. It was translated into Latin by Stephen of Antioch in 1127 A.D.\n\n'Abbas Ali (Mirza), whose poetical name is Bat\u00fbh, is the son of Naw\u00e1b Sayyid 'Ali Khan, son of Ghul\u00e2m Muhammad Khan, the son of Faiz-ullah Khan, Naw\u00e1b of Rampur.\n\n'Abbas bin-'Ali Shirwani, (\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0634\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a) author of a history, containing the narrative of Sher Shah the Afghan, who drove Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn from Hindustan, A.D. 1639, and mounted the throne of Delhi. This work was dedicated to the emperor Akbar, and is called Tuha-i-Akbarahahi. The first part of this work was translated into Urdu by Mah\u00e2r 'Ali Khan in the time of Lord Cornwallis and is entitled 'T\u00e2rikh-i-Sher Shahi.'\n\nVide Dowson, Elliot's History of India, IV, 301.\n\n'Abbas Mirza, (\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u064a\u0631\u0632\u0627) a Persian prince, son of Fath 'Ali Shah, was born in 1783. He died in 1833. His death was a great loss to his country, although he could not prevent the encroachments of Russia. His eldest son, Muhammad Mirza, mounted the throne in 1834, on the death of Fath 'Ali, under the united protection of England and Russia.\n\n'Abbas Mirza, (\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u064a\u0631\u0632\u0627) whose title was Naw\u00e1b Ikhtidaruddaula, was the author of a Magnawi in Urdu verse, containing a history of Christ.

(1st Ramazan, 978 A.H.). He was proclaimed king of Persia, in his sixteenth year, by the chiefs of Khurasan, and took possession of the throne during the lifetime of his father, Sultan Sikandar Shah, surnamed Muhammad Khudabanda, A.D. 1588, (996 A.H.). He was the first who made Isfahan the capital of Persia. He was brave and active, and enlarged the boundaries of his dominions. He took conjointly with the English forces, in 1622 A.D., the island of Ormus, which had been in the possession of the Portuguese for 122 years. He reigned 44 lunar years, was contemporary with Akbar and Jahangir, and died on Thursday, the 8th of January, 1629 A.D. (24th Jumada I, 1038 A.H.).

These brothers sprung from a numerous and respected family, of the descendants of the prophet, who were settled in the town of B\u00e1cha, and in consequence of their origin, they are best known in India by the name of S\u00e9d\u00e1ti, or Sayyids, of B\u00e1cha.

He succeeded Muhammad Kutb Shah, and reigned many years under the protection of the emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n, to whom he acknowledged himself tributary, and paid an annual sum; but in the year 1656 A.D., 1066 A.H., he displeased that monarch, and brought upon himself much trouble. The emperor had commanded him to permit his prime-minister Mir Muhammad Sa'id and his son Muhammad Amin to repair with their effects to court. Kutb-Shah disobeyed the mandate, and confining Muhammad Amin, then at Haidarabad, seized part of his wealth. The prince Amurgrub, then governor of the imperial territories in the Dakhin, enraged at this conduct, marched to Haidarabad, which he took and plundered. 'Abdullah was obliged to purchase pardon by a contribution of a crore of Rupees, and the gift of his daughter in marriage to the son of his enemy, the prince Sultan Muhammad.

Some time after, Ulugh Beg having been defeated in a battle against his son Mirza 'Abdul-Latif, and afterwards put to death by him in October 1449 A.D., Ramazan 853 A.H., and the latter not enjoying the success of his partricide above six months, 'Abdullah, as son-in-law to Ulugh Beg, took possession of his dominions; but Mirza Abu-Sa'id, his cousin-german, declared war against him, and defeated him in a pitched battle, in which he perished.

Having spent a year in Mosul, he removed to Damascus in Syria and thence to Egypt, where the people of the highest rank continued to vie with each other in cultivating his friendship. He afterwards travelled to Aleppo, and resided several years in Greece.

He was so generous as not to take a church from the Christians, which they had refused to grant him when he requested it. He was called Abu-Zub\u00e1b or \"father of flies,\" because his breath was so offensive, that it killed the very flies that settled on his lips. He resigned upwards of 21 lunar years and died in October, 705 A.D., Shaww\u00e1l, 86 A.H.

He was of noble descent, and born at Sevilla, the capital of Andalusia, where he exercised his profession with great reputation. His grandfather and father were both physicians. It is said that he lived to the age of 135; that he began to practice at 40 or, as others say, at 20; and had the advantage of a longer experience than almost any one ever had, for he enjoyed perfect health to his last hour. He left a son, also known by the name of Ibn-Zuh\u00e1r, who followed his father's profession, was in great favour with Al-Mans\u00far, emperor of Morocco, and wrote several treatises on physic. Avencour wrote a book, entitled \"Tayass\u00far fil-mud\u00e1v\u00e1rat wa-tad\u00e1bir,\" which is much esteemed. This work was translated into Hebrew in 1280 A.D., and thence into Latin by Paravicinius, whose version has had several editions. The author added a supplement to it, under the title of Jami', or Collection. He also wrote a treatise \"Fil-adwiy\u00e1t wal-aghziy\u00e1t,\" i.e., of medicines and food, wherein he treats of their qualities.

The well which God showed Hagar the mother of Isma'il in the wilderness, is said to have been miraculously discovered by 'Abdul-Muttalib, about five hundred years after it had been filled up by 'Amr, prince of the Quraishites. The well is called Zamzam by the Arabs and is on the east side of the Ka'ba, covered with a small building and cupola. Its water is highly reverenced, being not only received with particular devotion by the pilgrims, but also sent in bottles as a great rarity to most parts of the Muhammedan dominions.

He was one of the greatest of the collectors of the Shi'a traditions, and the most celebrated of all the Imamiya lawyers of Kuman Persia. This writer composed a large and a small Tafsir. There is considerable uncertainty as to the exact time when he lived. Shaikh Tusi says in the Fihrist that Abu-Ja'far died at Rai in 331 A.H., A.D. 942, but this appears to be erroneous. Shaikh Najashi, who died in A.D. 1014, states that Abu-Ja'far visited Baghdad, whilst yet in the prime of life, in A.H. 365, A.D. 965, which might well have been the case, since Abu-Hasan 'Ali bin-Babwaihi, the father of Abu-Ja'far, did not die until A.H. 329, A.D. 940. In addition to this, Nusrullah relates, on the authority of the Shaikh ad-Duryasi, that Abu-Ja'far lived in the time of Rukn-ud-daula Dailami, and had repeated interviews with that prince, who, as is well-known, reigned from A.H. 338 to A.H. 365, A.D. 949\u2013976.

He was one of the most inveterate enemies of Muhammad and his religion. Though his son Ikrima became a convert to the tenets of Muhammad, yet his father was for ever shut out from paradise; and so violent is the resentment of the Musalmans against this first enemy of their prophet, that they call the colocynth in contempt, the melon of Abu-Jahl.

He died of grief within a week after the defeat of Abu-Sufyan in the battle of Badr, which took place about the beginning of the year 624 A.D., 2 A.H. He was a man of wealth, of proud spirit and irritable temper. His son 'Utbe was engaged, or according to some, married to, Muhammad's third daughter Rukayya, but when Muhammad appeared as a prophet, the contract was dissolved, and Rukayya married her lover 'Usman.

When Musa, son of the khalfah 'Abdul-Malik, put to death one of Abul-'Aina's friends, and afterwards spread a report that he had escaped, Abul-'Aina said in the words of the Lawgiver of the Hebrews, \"Moses smote him and he died.\" The sentence was reported to the prince, and Abul-'Aina was summoned to appear. Instead of dreading the threats of the tyrant, he boldly replied in the words of the following verse in Exodus, \"Will thou kill me to-day as thou killedst the other man yesterday?\" The ingenuity of the expression disarmed the anger of Musa, who loaded him with presents.\n\nAbu-Leis Nasir Samarkandi, author of the work on jurisprudence in Arabic called \"Fiqh Abu-Leis,\" and the \"Ghunyat-ul-Mutbadi.\"\n\nAbul-'Ala, \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0647, entitled Malik-ush-Shu'ar, or royal poet of Ganja, flourished in the time of Manuchhir, ruler of Shirwan.

From his native country he went to Hir\u0101t in the latter part of the reign of Sult\u0101n Husain Mirz\u0101, and there till Muhammad Shah\u0101ni, commonly called Shah\u012b Beg Khan Usoak, conquered that province, and took him to M\u0101war\u0101n-nahr, or Transoxiana, where he died in 1550 A.D., 957 A.H. The chronogram of the year of his death is \"Faut-i-'Ash\u012bk,\" the death of 'Ash\u012bk.\nAbul-Ma'ali, whose proper name is Muhammad Sadr-uddin, is claimed by the Turks as the first of their poets, though his labours were not confined to their language alone, for he wrote in Arabic also, and was in Persian the rival and opponent of Nasir-uddin. He was contemporary with Jalal-uddin Rumi and his son Walad, and died about the year 1270 A.D. He is not, however, according to Baron von Hammer, strictly considered to be a Turkish poet by his countrymen; but the mystic tone which he adopted from Persian literature, and which he was undoubtedly the first to impress upon the national mind, gives him an unassailable right to the place assigned him. The names of his works, such as the \"Sea of Perfection,\" and the \"Key of Mysteries,\" indicate the peculiarity of his taste and genius; but amidst all the confusion of style and thought, some passages of great beauty and even simplicity are found in his works. He is lost, however, in the fame of his successor 'Amik.\n\nAbul-Ma'ali, the son of 'Abdul-Majid, the most eloquent of the Persians, who flourished in the time of Sultan Bahr\u00e2m Shah Ghaznavi, by whose order, in the year 1118 A.D., 612 A.H., he wrote in prose his \"Kalila Damma\" (or Pilpay's Fables) from a copy which Rudaki, the celebrated poet, had formerly used for poetry. This version continued in vogue till the time of Sultan Husain Mirz\u00e2, fourth in descent from 'Umar Shaikh, the second son of Amir Timur, when his prime minister Amir Shaikh Ahmad Suhaili got Husain Waiz to modernize it, in A.D. 1508, 910 A.H., under the name of \"Anwar Suhaili,\" or the Rays of Canopus. Abul-Fasi, the able prime minister of Akbar, compressed this work, and gave it the name of \"Ayat-Danish,\" or the touch-stone of knowledge. He is called Daulat Shah, Hamid-uddin Nagr-ullah. Vide Nagr-ullah, the son of 'Abdul-Hamid.\n\nAbul-Ma'ali, (Shah) a chief in the service of the emperor Akbar, who having revolted was compelled to seek safety in Kabul, where Mirz\u00e2 Muhammad Hakim, the brother of Akbar, gave him his sister, named Mihir-un-Nisa Begum, in marriage, and raised him to the first office in that kingdom. The ungrateful refugee, however, had not been many months in office, before he aspired to the kingdom of Kabul, and in March 1564 A.D., 971 A.H., basely assassinated Mirz\u00e2 Muhammad Hakim's mother, his own mother-in-law, who was a woman of uncommon abilities, and might with truth be said to have ruled that kingdom. He then pretended to act as regent to the young prince, who was still in his minority, with a view to get rid of him as soon as he could conciliate the Umaris. In the meantime Mirz\u00e2 Sulaim\u00e2n, prince of Badakhshan, attacked him, and slew him in a battle on the 13th May, 1564 A.D., 1st Shawwal, 971 A.H., and took possession of that country, which he held for two years.

His full name is Ja'far bin-Muhammad bin-'Umar Abul-Ma'shar. He is called the prince of the Arabian astrologers. He was born in Balkh. In his famous work, called \"Ulaif\" or \"Kitab-ul-Ulaif,\" which he wrote from a Sanskrit work on astronomy, he asserts that, when the world was created, the seven planets were together in the first point of the sign of Arius, and that it will end when the same planets shall meet again in the last point of Pisces in their exaltation or Dragon's head. He died in A.D. 885, 272 A.H. His works were printed in Latin at Venice in 1586, 8vo.\n\nAbul-Najib al-Bukhari, poetically called also 'Am'ak, was a Persian poet who flourished in the fifth century of the Hijra at the court of the Sultan Kadr Khan, king or khata'ban of Turkistan, who made him president of the academy of poets which he had established. His poem of the loves of Yusuf and Zalisha, which can be read in two different metres, is much admired. He was particularly famous for his elegies. He lived nearly 100 years. Daulat Shah says, he lived in the time of Sultan Sanjar, who requested him to write an elegy on the death of his daughter Malik Khata'in, which he did, although he was then blind on account of old age.

In the latter part of his reign he fancied himself a god, and found no fewer than 16,000 persons who owned him as such. These were mostly the Darfrians, a new sect sprung up about this time, who were so called from their chief, Muhammad Ibn-Ismail, surnamed Darfari. He is supposed to have inspired the mad khalifa with this impious notion; and as Darfari set up for a second Moses, he did not scruple to assert that Abu-Mansur was the great creator of the universe.

According to the majority of authorities, he was born at Tus in Khurasan. He wrote an immense number of treatises on alchemy, also a work on astronomy. An edition of his works in Latin was published at Dantzig in 1662, and another in English by Rusell in 1678.\n\nAbu-Musa al-Ash'ari, one of the arbitrators between 'Ali and Mu'awiya I, by whose decision 'Ali was deposed in the year 658 A.D., 37 A.H. Eight months after the battle of Siffin between 'Ali and Mu'awiya, the two arbitrators Abu-Musa and 'Amr the son of As met at a place between Mecca and Kufa, where a tribunal was erected. Abu-Musa first ascending it, pronounced these words with a loud voice:\u2014\"I depose 'Ali and Mu'awiya from the Khilafat (or government) to which they pretend, after the same manner as I take this ring from my finger,\" and immediately came down. 'Amr then went up and said, \"You have heard how Abu-Musa has on his part deposed 'Ali; as for my part I depose him too, and I give the khilafat to Mu'awiya, and invest him with it after the same manner as I put this ring upon my finger;\" and this I do with so much the more justice, because he is 'Umayr's heir and avenger and the worthiest of all men to succeed him.\"\n\nAbu-Muslim, a great general, to whom the Abbasides entirely owed their elevation to the khilafat, for which he is commonly called Sahib-ad-Dawat, or author of the vocation of the Abbasides. For his good conduct and bravery, he occupied the first posts in the service of the Omnaides. He was governor of Khurasan A.D. 746, when he proclaimed the Abbasides the lawful heirs of the khilafat and in 749 A.D. transferred the dignity of Khilafat from the family of Umayya to that of the Abbasides. This revolution occasioned the death of above 600,000 men; and when Abu-Jafar Al-Manzar, the second Khilafa of the race of 'Abdullah, son of 'Ali, 'Abd-Muslim was despatched against him. This general having harassed him for five months together, at last brought him to a general action, and having entirely defeated him, forced him to fly to Bagra. Notwithstanding all his services, however, Abu-Muslim was soon after, on Thursday the 13th February, 755 A.D., 24th Sha'b\u00e2n 137 A.H., ungratefully and barbarously murdered by Al-Manzar, and his body was thrown into the Tigris.

His proper name is Abu-'Ali. He died A.D. 810, 196 A.H.\n\nAbu-Rihan al-Biruni, or Abu-Rihan Muhammad bin-Ahmad al-Bir\u00fbni, was born about the year 971 A.D. in the town of Bir\u00fbn, said to be situated in the province of Khw\u00e2rasm. He was astronomer, geometerian, historian, scholar, and logician. Besides metaphysics and dialectics, he studied and appears to have drawn his chief lustre from attainments in the magical art. Of this, the following instance is related. One day Sultan Mahm\u00fbd ordered him to deposit with a third person a statement of the precise manner in which the monarch would quit the hall where he then was sitting. The paper being lodged, the king, instead of going out by one of the numerous doors, caused a breach to be made in the wall, by which he effected his exit;\u2014but how was\nhe amazed, when, on the paper being examined, there was found in it a minute specification of the precise spot through which he penetrated! Hereupon the prince with horror denounced this learned man as a sorcerer, and commanded him to be instantly thrown out of the window. The barbarous sentence was presently executed; but care had been taken to prepare beneath a soft cushion, into which the body of the sage sank without sustaining any injury. Abu-Raihan was then called before the monarch, and was required to say whether by his boasted art he had been able to foresee these events, and the treatment through which he had that day passed. The learned man immediately desired his tablets to be sent for, in which were found regularly predicted the whole of these singular transactions. He travelled to different countries, and to and from India, for the space of 40 years. He wrote many works, and is said to have executed seven translations from the Greek and epitomized the Almagest of Ptolemy. His Greek works are said to have exceeded a camel load. The most valuable of all his works is the \"T\u0101r\u012bkh-ul-Hind.\" Another of his works is the K\u0101n\u016bn Ma'\u0101'id, dedicated to Sultan Ma'\u0101id of Ghazni, for which he received an elephant-load of silver coins. He lived in the time of Sultan Mahmud and Ma'\u0101id Ghamaw\u012b, and died in the year 1039 A.D., 430 A.H.\n\nFor further notes vide Dowson, Elliot's Histy. of India, II, I.]\n\nAbu-Sa'id, the son of 'Abdullah, an Arabian poet who flourished in the court of Sel\u0101hid-din, and was his prime minister.

The following is a list of the princes of the family of Chingis Kh\u0101n, who were raised to nominal power after the death of Abu-Sa'id Kh\u0101n.\n\nArp\u0101 Kh\u0101n (Mu'izz-uddin) was crowned in 1325, reigned five months, and was killed in battle in 1336 A.D.\n\nMusa Kh\u0101n was elevated in 1336, reigned two years, and was murdered in 1338 A.D.\n\nS\u0101ki, sister of Abu-Sa'id Kh\u0101n, was elevated to the throne in 1338. She was married to Jah\u0101n Timur who got the kingdom as her dowry, but was deposed the same year. After him Sulaiman Kh\u0101n was declared king; he left the kingdom and went to Diyarbakr in 1344.\n\nNausherwan was elevated in 1334.\n\nAbu-Sa'id Mirza, (Sultan) the son of Sultan Muhammad Mirza, son of Mir\u0101nsh\u0101h, son of Amir Timur (Tamerlane). He was born in 1427 A.D. After the death of his father in 1441, he continued to live with Mirza Ulugh Beg, son of Mirza Shahrukh at Samar-kand, and served in his army when he was at war with his son Mirza Abdul-Latif; but when that prince was murdered by his unnatural son in October 1449 A.D., Ramazan, 853 A.H., and he in his turn was slain after six or seven months by his own soldiers, and Samar-kand was taken possession of by Mirza 'Abdullah, son of Mirza Ibrahim and grandson of Mirza Shahrukh, Abu-Sa'id with the assistance of Abu-Khair Uzbak having defeated and taken 'Abdullah prisoner in a battle, put him to death and ascended the throne of Samar-kand in 1461 A.D., 855 A.H. He also took possession of Khurasan after the death of Babar Sultan, son of Bayasunghar Mirza in 1467, 861 A.H., and greatly extended his dominions, but was at last taken prisoner in an ambuscade and put to death on the 8th February, 1469 A.D., 26th Rajab, 873 A.H., after he had reigned 18 years. After his death, Sultan Humayun B\u0101ghsh\u012b named Abdul-Ghaf\u012br, a descendant of Amir Timur, made himself master of the empire. Abu-Sa'id at his death left eleven sons, viz., Mirza Sultan Ahmad, Mirza Sultan Mahmud, Mirza Sultan Muhammad, Mirza Shahrukh, Mirza Ulugh Beg, Mirza 'Umar Shaikh, Mirza Ab\u016b-Bakr, Mirza Sultan Murad, Mirza Sultan Khal\u012bf, Mirza Sultan Wal\u012bd, and Mirza Sultan Timur; of whom four arrived to the dignity of kings, viz., Mirza Ulugh Beg to the throne of Kabul; Mirza Sultan Ahmad to the kingdom of Samar-kand; Mirza 'Umar Shaikh to the united thrones of Andijan and Farghana; and Mirza Sultan Mahmud to those of Kunduz and Badakhshan. Abu-Sa'id Mirza, says Babar Shah, though brought up in the city, was illiterate and unrefined.

At the age of eighteen, he began to practice, and with such success that he became physician to the court of Baghdad. He was born in the city of Bukhara in 985 A.D., 373 A.H., and died at Hamadan in July, 1037, 427 A.H., aged 52 lunar years, with the character of a learned man but too much addicted to wine and effeminating pleasures. His works on Medicine, &c., were in number 100, now nearly all lost. He is also called Ibn-Sin\u0101. The following are the titles of his works. Of the Utility and Advantages of Sciences, 20 books. Of Innocence and Criminality, 2 books. Of Health and\nRemedies, 18 books. On the means of preserving Health, 3 books. Canons on Physic, 14 books. On Astronomical Observations, 1 book.

He was an able and ambitious man, of great wealth and influence, and one of the most persevering and powerful opponents of Muhammad. He was the father of Mu'awiya, the first khalifa of the house of Umayya, and one of the heads of the tribe of Kurish, to which Muhammad also belonged. When Muhammad took up arms for the propagation of his faith, Abu-Sufyan was made generalissimo of his enemies against him; and after the battle of Badr, he stood very fair for the headship of that tribe. But he was at last convinced (as it seems), by a signal victory gained by Muhammad over his enemies, of the truth of the prophet's pretensions, and was converted in the 8th year of the Hijra, A.D. 629.\n\nAbu-Sulaiman Daud, \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0648\u062f, bin-Abul-Fagl bin-Muhammad Fakhr Binakit, so called from having been born at Binakit, or Finakit, a town in Transoxiana, afterwards called Shahrukhia.

After some years he again visited India in the time of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n, who employed him and conferred on him the title of \"Malik-ush-Shu'ara',\" or Poet Laureate. He was twice weighed against gold and silver, and the amount was given to him as a reward for his poetical talents. He died at L\u0101hore on the 19th November, 1651, 16th Zil-hijjah 1061 A.H. He is the author of a poem called \"Zafarn\u0101ma-i-Shah Jah\u0101n,\" or the conquests of Shah Jah\u0101n, and of a Diwan in Persian.\n\nAbu-Talib Khan, \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u062e\u0627\u0646, (Mirz\u0101) the son of H\u0101ji Muhammad Beg Kh\u0101n, by descent a Turk, was born at Lakhnau in the year A.D. 1752, 1165 A.H.

In this situation he continued for two years; and after the death of his patron, and the appointment of Haidar Beg Kh\u0101n to his office, he was superseded, and repaired to Lakhnau, and was allowed by the Naw\u0101b 60,000 Rupees per annum for his support. After the expiration of one year, Colonel Alexander Hume, having succeeded Collector of Gorakhpur, requested the Naw\u0101b to take him with him as an assistant; in which situation he continued for three years. He was afterwards employed by Mr. Middleton, the Resident of Lakhnau, in reducing the rebel r\u0113j\u0101 Balbhaddar Singh, whom, during two years, he frequently defeated and pursued. At length being surprised in his camp, the r\u0113j\u0101 in endeavouring to make his escape, was killed. Abu-Talib, after this falling in distress for some years, embarked for Europe with Captain David Richardson, a Scotchman, and left Calcutta in February, 1799, Ram\u0101zn 1213 A.H. He visited England and other parts of Europe, and was well known in London under the title of the Persian Prince. During his travels he wrote a Journal in which he daily inserted every event, and committed to writing such reflections as occurred to him at the moment. On his return to Calcutta in 1803, 1218 A.H., having revised and abridged his notes, he published them under the title of \"Ma\u1e63\u0101f-ut-Tal\u012bb f\u012b Bil\u0101d-i-Iranj\u0101n.\" This work was translated by Charles Stewart, and published in London in the year 1814.

Having arrived in the city of Hamad\u0101n, he was received with great distinction by Abul-Waf\u0101 bin-Salama. When about to depart, a heavy fall of snow made the roads for a long time impassable. Abul-Waf\u0101 conducted the poet to his library, and placed it entirely at his disposal. Surrounded with these literary treasures, Abu-Tammam forgot his journey, read the precious volumes with avidity, and devoted his time to the composition of several works. The poetical collection, entitled \"Khamsa,\" was the principal fruit of these researches, and attests the indefatigable attention with which the learned writer had ransacked this rich library. Amongst the other works that he wrote, one is called \"Fuh\u016bl-ush-Shu'ara'.\" He was born in A.D. 804, 188 A.H., at J\u0101sim near Damascus, and died in A.D. 846, 231 A.H.\n\nAbu-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi, \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0628\u06cc, vide Mutanabbi.\nAbu-Turab, Mir, a Salami Sayyid of Shiraz, who served, with his son Mir Gadi, in Gujrat, and then under Akbar.

Umar, on his accession to the khalifa, replaced Abu-'Ubaida in the command of the army in Syria, being greatly displeased with the cruel and blood-thirsty disposition of Khalid. Abu-'Ubaida extended his conquests over Palestine and Syria, and drove the Greeks out of the whole country extending from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates. This conquest was completed in 639 A.D., 18 A.H., in which year Syria was visited by a dreadful plague, in which the Moslems lost 25,000 men, among whom were Abu-'Ubaida himself, Yazid ibn Abu-Sufyan, and many other men of distinction.\n\nAbu-'Ubaida ibn-Mas'ud, a general in the time of the khalifa 'Umar.

He supported the tenets of Abu-Hanifa, and maintained the dignity of his office by impartiality. When one day reproached for his ignorance of one of the causes brought before him, for the decision of which he received an ample allowance, he jocosely replied, that he received in proportion as he knew; but, said he, if I were paid for all I do not know, the riches of the khalifa itself would not be sufficient to answer my demands.

This led to further intimacies, Timur being a patron of literary men; and one day when both were in the bath, the monarch amused himself by putting crochety questions to Ahmadi, and laughing at his answers. \"Suppose now,\" said he, pointing to the surrounding attendants, \"you were required to value these beautiful boys, how much would you say each was worth?\" Ahmadi answered with becoming gravity, estimating one at a camel-load of silver, another at six bushels of pearls, a third at forty gold wedges, and so made the circuit of the ring. \"Very fair,\" said Timur, \"and now tell me, What do you value me at?\" \"Four and twenty aspers,\" replied the poet, \"more or less.\" \"What!\" cried Timur, laughing, \"why the shirt I have on is worth that.\" \"Do you really think so?\" asked Ahmadi, with the greatest apparent simplicity\u2014\"at that rate you must be worth nothing, for I include the shirt in the valuation!\" Much to his credit, Timur instead of being angry, applauded and rewarded the wit and boldness of the poet.

In the year 933, Muhammad the son of T\u0101j\u012b, or T\u0101j\u012b, surnamed al-Ashhad, seized upon Syria and Egypt in the khilafat of ar-R\u0101z\u012b Billah, and his family retained the whole of it, except a small part which 'Ubayd-ulla al-Mahd\u012b, the first of the F\u0101\u1e6dimite dynasty (the seat of whose empire was at Kairuw\u0101n near Tunis) had conquered in A.D. 910. His successor Ab\u016b-Tam\u012bm Ma'd, surnamed Mu'izz li-d\u012bn-illah, conquered the rest of Egypt about the year 970, by his general Ja'far, who built the city of al-K\u0101hirah, commonly called Grand Cairo, whither his master soon removed his court. The F\u0101\u1e6dimite dynasty ended in A.D. 1176, when, upon the death of the last prince of this family, the kingdom was usurped by the famous Sal\u0101h-uddin (Saladin).\n\nList of the Khalifas of Barbary.\n\n'Ubayd-ulla al-Mahd\u012b, first of the F\u0101\u1e6dimite race.\nAl-K\u0101mir Mahd\u012b, his son.\nIsm\u0101'il, surnamed al-Mans\u016br, son of al-K\u0101mir.\nMu'izz li-d\u012bn-illah, son of al-Mans\u016br, who conquered Egypt and became the first khalifa of the F\u0101\u1e6dimite dynasty in that country.\n\nAhmad Ikani, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0625\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0646\u064a, also called Ahmad Jalayir; vide Hasan Burzurg.\n\nAhmad Jafari, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062c\u0627\u0641\u0631\u064a, (Khw\u0101ja) vide Ahmad\u012b.\n\nAhmad Jalal Bukhari, (Sayyid) son of Sayyid Muhammad Bukhari.\n\nAhmad Jalayir, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0631, also called Ahmad Ikani, a descendant of Hasan Burzurg, which see.\n\nAhmad Jam, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062c\u0627\u0645, (Shaikh ul-Isl\u0101m) entitled Ab\u016b-N\u0101sir and Zinda-P\u012bl, a celebrated Muhammedan saint of Nish\u0101p\u016br, born in the year 1049 A.D., 441 A.H.

He is said to have been baptized in his youth by the name of Nicholas, but policy, or conviction, led him to abandon the doctrine of Christ for that of Muhammed, when he assumed the name of Ahmad Kh\u0101n. In the first year of his reign, Majd-ul-Mulk Yazdi, a nobleman of his court, being accused of sorcery, lost his life. He put his own brother to death, and was successful in obtaining possession of the person of his nephew, Arghun Kh\u0101n: but that prince was not only rescued from his violence by the Mughul nobles, but by their aid was enabled to deprive him of his crown and life on the night of Thursday, 11th August 1284 A.D., 26th Jum\u0101da I, 683 A.H., and become his successor.\n\nAhmad Khan Bangash, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u06af\u0634, second son of Muhammad Kh\u0101n Bangash, Naw\u0101b of Farrukhab\u0101d.

He came from the Dakhin to the court of the emperor Akbar, in the year 1582 A.D., 990 A.H., and when that monarch ordered the \"T\u0101rikh-i-Alfi\" to be compiled, several authors were employed in the compilation, but subsequently the\nchief labour devolved upon Mull\u00e1 Ahmad.

H., persecuted the Mull\u00e1, who was always openly reviling the first Khal\u00edfa, and drove his own house at midnight out of his premises, and then bound him in the streets of L\u00e1h\u00f3r. For this act Mirz\u00e1 F\u00e1d\u00edl was sentenced to death, was bound alive to the legs of an elephant in the city of L\u00e1h\u00f3r, and dragged along till he died.

H., or 1589 A. D. Mull\u00e1 Ahmad was buried at L\u00e1h\u00f3r, but being a Sha'\u00ed, who openly used to revile the first Khal\u00edfa, the people of L\u00e1h\u00f3r exhumated his remains and burnt them.\n\n[See Kin Translation, I, 206.]\n\nAhmad Niz\u00e1m Shah Bahri, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0646\u06cc\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u06cc, the founder of the Niz\u00e1m-Sh\u00e1hi dynasty of the Dakhin, was the son of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk Bahri, prime minister to Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad Shah Bahmani. He had conquered many places in the vicinity of his father's j\u00e1gir, and was besieging the fort of Dundr\u00e1jpur about the year A. D. 1438, 891 A. H., when he received intelligence of the assassination of his father, and immediately returned and assumed the titles of the deceased, and was generally known by those of Ahmad Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk Bahri, to which the people of the Dakhin added the title of Shah. As he had distinguished himself by repeated acts as a general in the field, though the Sult\u00e1n wished to remove him from power, none of his abilities would permit the task of reducing him. However, on the 3rd May 1490, 3rd Raj\u00e1b 935 A. H., gained a victory over the army of the Sult\u00e1n, and from that time he sat without opponent on the masnad of royalty, and by the advice of Y\u00fasef 'Adil Sh\u00e9h, who had already become independent, having discontinued to read the khutba in the name of the king, put in his own and spread a white umbrella over his head. He laid the foundation of the city of Ahmadnagar in A. D. 1495, 900 A. H., which was completed in two years, and became the first of the Niz\u00e1m-Sh\u00e1hi kings of Ahmadnagar. He died in A.

The author of the Muntakhabat-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh states, that his grandfather placed him on the throne during his lifetime, in the year 818 H. or 1410 A. D., and that he survived that measure five months and sixteen days. In the same year, he laid the foundation of a new city on the banks of the S\u00e1harm\u00e1t\u00ed, which he called after his own name, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and which afterwards became the capital of the kings of Gujrat. The date of the laying of the foundation of this city is contained in the words \"B\u00e1-khair\", i.e. all well. He died after a reign of nearly 33 years, on the 4th July 1443 A. D., 4th Rabi' I, 847 H., and was succeeded by his son Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h.\nAhmad Shah II, king of Gujrat. After the death of Mahmud Shah III, there being no relation on whom the succession might devolve, I'timad Khan, the prime minister, resolved rather than see the kingdom in absolute anarchy, to elevate a youth, whom he asserted to be the son of prince Ahmad Khan, formerly governor of Ahmadabad, and declared him the legal successor to the crown of Gujrat. He was forthwith placed on the throne on the 18th February 1554 A.D., 15th Rab' I, 961 A.H. He reigned 7 years and some months, and was found murdered one morning at the foot of the palace wall. This event took place on Monday the 21st April 1561 A.D., 5th Sha'ban, 968 A.H. He was succeeded by Mu'azzaf Shah III.\n\n[Vide Kin Translation, I, 335.]\n\nAhmad Shah Abdali, commonly called Shah Durrani, was the son of a chief of the Afgh\u00e1n tribe of Abdal, in the vicinity of the city of Hierat. He was taken prisoner in his infancy by Nadir Shah, who gave him the post of a mace-bearer, and by degrees promoted him to a considerable command in the army. The morning after the assassination of Nadir Shah, which took place in the night of the 12th May, 1747, O.S., he made an attack, supported by a corps of Uzbeks, upon the Persian troops, but was repulsed. He then left the army, and proceeding by rapid marches to Kandahar, not only obtained possession of that city, but took a large convoy of treasure which was coming from Kabul and Sindh to the Persian camp. By the aid of these means, he laid the foundation of a kingdom, which soon attained a strength that rendered it formidable to the surrounding nations. He not only subdued Kundahar and Kabul, but took Peshawar and Lahore; and emboldened by his success, and the weakness of the empire, he resolved the conquest of the capital of Hindustan. In the beginning of the year 1748, 1161 A.H., he began his march from Lahore. Muhammad Shah, the emperor of Delhi, being at this time too indisposed to take the field, despatched his only son, prince Ahmad, against the enemy, under the command of the wazir, Kamaruddin Khan, Safdar-Jang, governor of Agra, and several other chiefs, with a great army. For some days several skirmishes took place between the two armies near Sarhind. At length, on Friday 11th March, 1748, 22nd Rab' I, 1161 A.H., Kamaruddin Khan, the wazir, being killed as he was at his devotion in his tent by a cannon ball, a panic prevailed in the Mughul army; the battle, however, continued till a magazine of rockets taking fire in the enemy's camp, numbers of the troops were wounded by the explosion; and Shah Abdali, either disheartened by the loss, or satisfied by the plunder gained at Sarhind, thought it proper to retreat towards Kabul, which he did unmolested. In the year 1757 A.D., 1170 A.H., he again advanced as far as Delhi and Agra, and after having plundered and massacred the inhabitants of Mathura, he returned to Kandahar. About the year 1758 A.D., 1172 A.H., the Maratha power had spread itself in almost every province of Hindustan, when Najib-ud-daula, the Rohila, Shuj'ud-daula Nawab of Andhra, and not only the Musalmans but Hindus also, joined in petition to Ahmad Shah Abdali, that he would march and assume the throne of Delhi in which they promised to support him. The Abdali enraged at the seizure of Lahore by the Marathas, rejoiced at the invitation, and advanced without delay across the Indus, and driving the Marathas before him, he did not stop till they reached the vicinity of Delhi. He engaged the Marathas in several battles, and attained the highest renown among Muhammadans by the memorable defeat that he gave the hostile army on the plains of Panipat. This famous action was fought in January, 1761. After this victory, Durrani Shah returned to his own country, but before his departure, he acknowledged Shah Alam, then in Bengal, as emperor of Hindustan, and commanded Shuj'ud-daula and other chiefs to submit to his authority. He died after a reign of 26 years in 1772 A.D., 1182 A.H., aged 60 years, and was succeeded by his son Timur Shah. His tomb, covered with a gilt cupola, stands near the king's palace, and is held sacred as an asylum.\n\nAhmad Shah Wali Bahmani I, (Sult\u00e1n), was the second son of Sult\u00e1n D\u00e1d\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h of the Bahmani race. He ascended the throne of the Dakhin on the 15th September, 1422 A.D., 8th Shawwal 825 A.H., ten days before the demise of his brother Sult\u00e1n Firuz Sh\u00e1h, who had resigned the crown in his favor. He is the founder of the city and fort of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Bid\u00e1r, the foundation of which he laid in the year 1432 A.D., 836 A.H. It is said that the Sult\u00e1n, on his return from a war at Bid\u00e1r, took to the amusement of hunting; and coming to a most beautiful spot, finely watered, resolved to build upon it a city, to be called after his name, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. A citadel of great extent and strength was erected on the very site of Bid\u00e1r, the ancient capital of princes, who, according to the Hind\u00fa books, 5000 years back, possessed the whole extent of Mirhat, Karnatak, and Talingana. Raj\u00e1 Bhim Sen was one of the most celebrated of this house, and the history of the loves of his daughter and Raj\u00e1 Nal, king of M\u00e1liwa, are famous through all Hindust\u00e1n. Their story was translated from the Sanskrit by Shaikh Faizi, under the title of \"Nal Daman,\" into Persian verse, at the command of the emperor Akbar Sh\u00e1h. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h reigned 12 lunar years and 10 months, and died on the 19th of February 1435 A.D., 18th Rajab, 838 A.H. He was buried at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Bid\u00e1r, and was succeeded by his son Sult\u00e1n 'Al\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn II.\n\nAhmad Shah Bahmani, II, (Sult\u00e1n). On the death of his father Sult\u00e1n Mahmud Sh\u00e1h II, in October 1518 A.D., Shawwal 924 A.H., Amir Barid, his prime-minister, dreading that the surrounding powers would attack him should he assume open independence, placed prince Ahmad, son of the late king, upon the throne at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Bid\u00e1r, leaving him the palace, with the use of the royal jewels and a daily allowance of money for his support. The sum not being equal to his expenses, the king broke up the crown, which was valued at 400,000 huns, or \u00a3160,000, and privately sold the jewels. He died two years after his accession to the throne, in the year 1521 A.D., 927 A.H. After his death Amir Barid raised Sultan 'Al\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn III, one of the princes, on the throne. Two years after, he was imprisoned, and another son of Mahmud Sh\u00e1h, named Wali-ullah Sh\u00e1h, was placed in his room. Three years after his accession, the minister conceiving a passion for his wife, he caused him to be poisoned, and repoused the queen. He then placed Kalimullah, the son of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h II, on the throne. This prince enjoyed nothing but the name of sovereign, and was never allowed to leave the palace. He was afterwards treated with great rigour by Amir Barid, whereupon he made his escape, first to his uncle Isma'il 'Adil Sh\u00e1h to Bijapur, and thence to Burhan Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h of Ahmadnagar, where he resided till his death. With him ended the dynasty of the Bahmani kings of the Dakhin. In fact before this event, the Dakhin was divided into five kingdoms\u2014'Adil-Sh\u00e1hi or kings of Bijapur; Kutb-Sh\u00e1hi, or kings of Golkonda; Imad-Sh\u00e1hi, or kings of Barar; Niz\u00e1m-Sh\u00e1hi or kings of Ahmadnagar; and Barid-Sh\u00e1hi, kings of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Bid\u00e1r.\n\nAhmad Shah of Bengal, succeeded his father Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn to the throne of Bengal in 834 H. or 1430 A.D., reigned about 16 years, and died about the year 1446 A.D., 850 A.H. He was succeeded by N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Mahmud Sh\u00e1h I, a descendant of Shams-ud-d\u00edn Ily\u00e1s Sh\u00e1h.\n\nAhmad Shah, or Ahmad-ud-d\u00edn Sh\u00e1h, commonly called \"The Maulawi\", a prominent character\nin the neighbourhood of Shahjahanpur and Muhammad during the mutiny of 1857. He is said to have been the inspired Fakir who travelled through the upper provinces, a few years ago, on a miraculous mission. He made a pretty long stay at Agra, astonishing the natives and puzzling the authorities. It seems probable that he was even then busy in sowing the seeds of rebellion. He held great power within the city of Lakhnau, in March, 1858, when the Commander-in-chief entered that city and commanded a stronghold in the very heart of the city. He was slain at Pusin, on the 16th June, 1858, sixteen miles north-east of Shahjahanpur, and the raja of that place sent the head and trunk to Mr. Gilbert Money, the Commissioner.\n\nAhmad Shihab-uddin Talish,\n\nvide Shihab-uddin Ahmad Talish.\n\nAhmad Suhaili, \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0644\u06cc (Amir), seal-bearer to Sultan Hussain Mirza of Hirdi, to whom several of the poets of his time dedicated their works.

He was made an eunuch in his childhood by Adil Shah, the nephew and immediate successor of Nadir Shah. After the death of 'Adil Shah, he obtained his release, and joined his father, who was afterwards slain by Karim Khan Zand, king of Persia. Agha Ak\u00e1 Muhammad was obliged to surrender himself to him, and was a prisoner in the city of Shiraz. He had for some time been very strictly guarded, and was never allowed to go beyond the walls of the town, but afterwards he was permitted to go a-hunting. When the last illness of Karim Khan assumed a dangerous appearance, he contrived to leave that city on the usual pretext of hunting. When intelligence was brought to him that the founder of the Zund dynasty was no more, accompanied by a few attendants, he commenced his flight, and favored by the confusion of the moment, he reached his province of Mazandaran in safety, and proclaimed himself one of the competitors for the crown of Persia. Soon after the\ndeath of 'Ali Murad Khan, ruler of Persia, in 1785 A.D., he made himself master of Isfahan without a battle, but had for several years to contend with Lutf 'Ali Khan, the last prince of the Zand family, before he became sole master of Persia.

He afterwards quitted his court, and repaired to Persia, where he died in 1706, 1118 A.H., a few months before his father, and was buried at Mashhad in Khurasan. Alamgir, at one time, intended to make Akbar his successor, and this preference arose from Akbar being the son of a Muhammadan mother, the daughter of Shah Nawaz Khan; whereas his brothers Sultans Mu'azzam and Azam were born of Rajput princesses.\n\nAkbar Shah, Akbar Shah, the Great, emperor of Hindust\u00e1n, surnamed Abul-Fath Jal\u00e1l-ud-din Muhammad, was the eldest son of the emperor Humayun, and was born in Amarkot in the province of Sindh on Sunday the 16th October, 1542 A.D., 5th Rajab, 949 A.H., at a time when his father, after being defeated by Sher Shah, had taken refuge with Rana Prasad. At the time of his father's death, Akbar was at Kal\u00e1npur, where he had been deputed by his father with a considerable force to expel the ex-King Sitanar Shah Suri from the Siwalik mountains. When information reached the prince of this mournful event, Bairam Khan, and other officers who were present, raised him to the throne on Friday, 14th February, 1556 A.D., 2nd Rab' II, 963 A.H., Akbar being then only 13 years and 9 months old. He enlarged his dominions by the conquest of Gujarat, Bengal, Kashmir, and Sind. Besides the forts of Atak, Agra, and Allahabad, many military works were erected by him. He also built and fortified the town of Fatehpur Sikri, which was his principal residence, and which, though now deserted, is one of the most splendid remains of former grandeur of India. He died after a prosperous reign of 51 lunar years and 9 months on Wednesday, the 16th October, 1605, Old Style, 13th Jam\u00e1da II, 1014 A.H., aged 64 lunar years and 11 months. The words \"Faut-i-Akbar Shah,\" (the death of Akbar Shah) are the chronogram of his death. He was buried in the village of Sikandra in the environs of Agra, where a splendid mausoleum was built over his remains by his son Jahangir, which is still in a high state of preservation. He received after his death the title of \"Aras-Ashyani,\" and was succeeded by his son Sultan Salim, who assumed the title of Jahangir. His mother's name was Hamida Banu, commonly called Maryam-Makani. The history of this potentate has been written, with great elegance and precision by his wazir Abul-Fazl, in a work, entitled the \"Akbar-nama.\" In order to keep his turbulent Umaris, Turks, and Afghans, in check, Hindu chiefs were encouraged by Akbar, and entrusted with the highest powers, both military and civil, as was the case with Raja Maldeo of Marwar, Bhagwan Das of Amber, Man Singh, his son, and Raja Todar Mal. He also connected himself and his sons with them by marriage. Both Akbar and his successor, Jahangir, had amongst their wives several of Hindu origin. Towards the middle of his reign, Akbar became dissatisfied with the Muhammadan religion, and invited his court teachers of the Christian, Hind\u00fa, and Parsi religions, and took an interest in their discussions. He adopted, however, neither, but attempted to found a new system of belief, called 'Din-i-Illahi', which acknowledged one God, and the king as his vicegerent.\n\nAkbar Shah II, Akbar Shah II, king of Dihli, whose title in full is Abul-Nasr Mu'in-ud-din Muhammad Akbar Shah, was the son of the nominal emperor Shah Alam; was born on Wednesday, 23rd April, 1780, New Style, 7th Ramzan, 1173 H., and succeeded his father at the age of 43, on the 19th of November, 1826 A.D., 7th Rajab, 1221 H., as titular king of Dihli. On his accession he made some weak attempts to increase his influence and power. These were properly resisted, but at the same time the advice given by Lord Wellesley, to increase the allowance of the imperial family, when the revenue of the country improved, was redeemed by an act of politic liberality. An augmentation of ten thousand rupees per mensem was appropriated for the support of his eldest son, whom he had declared heir-apparent. He sat on the throne of his ancestors nearly 32 lunar years; died on Friday, 28th September, 1837, 28th Jam\u00e1da II, 1253 A.H., aged about 60 lunar years, and was buried at Dihli, close to the tomb of Bahadur Shah.

His father, M\u012brz\u0101 Muhammad, a Turkm\u0101n, an officer in the service of the prince A'z\u0101d Sh\u0101h, on the death of his patron in 1707 A.D., falling into distress, moved from Dihli to Kat\u0101k, the capital of Or\u012bsa, in hopes of mending his fortune under Shuj\u0101'-udd\u012bn, the son-in-law of Naw\u0101b Mursh\u012bd Kuli Ja'far Kh\u0101n, Sub\u0101dar of Bengal, who received him with kindness, and after some time bestowed on his son the Faujdar\u012b of R\u0101jmahall, and procured for him from the emperor a manz\u0101r and the title of Allahwird\u012b Kh\u0101n, and afterwards that of Mah\u0101bat Jang. After the death of Shuj\u0101'-udd\u012bn, and the accession of his son Sarfar\u0101z Kh\u0101n to the government of Bengal, Allahwird\u012b contrived to murder the latter in 1740 A.D., 1153 A.H., and usurped the government. He reigned sixteen years over the three provinces of Bengal, Bihar, and Or\u012bsa, and died on Saturday, the 10th April, 1756 N.S., 9th Rajab, 1169 A.H., aged 80 years. He was buried in Murshid\u0101b\u0101d near the tomb of his mother in the garden of Khush-B\u0101gh, and was succeeded by his grand-nephew and grandson M\u012brz\u0101 Muhammad, better known by his assumed name of Sirj\u0101j-ud-daula.

He was no sooner seated on the throne than he formed a design of excluding his brother al-M\u0101m\u016bn from the succession. Accordingly, he deprived him of the furniture of the imperial palace of Khur\u0101s\u0101n; and in open violation of his father's will, who had bestowed on al-M\u0101m\u016bn the perpetual government of Khur\u0101s\u0101n and of all the troops in that province, he ordered these forces to march directly to Baghd\u0101d. Upon the arrival of this order, al-M\u0101m\u016bn expostulated with the general al-Fa\u1e93l Ibn R\u0101fi'a, who com-\nAlamayo\n\nmanded his troops, and endeavoured to prevent his marching to Baghdad; but without effect, for he punctually obeyed the orders sent by the caliph. Al-Fazl having ingratiated himself with the caliph by his ready compliance with his orders, was chosen prime-minister, and governed with absolute sway, al-Amin abandoning himself entirely to drunkenness. Al-Fazl was a very able minister; but fearing al-Mamun's resentment, if ever he should ascend the throne, he gave al-Amin such advice as proved in the end the ruin of them both. He advised him to deprive al-Mamun of the right of succession that had been given him by his father, and transfer it to his own son Musa, though then but an infant. Agreeable to this pernicious advice, the caliph sent for his brother al-Kasim from Mesopotamia, and recalled al-Mamun from Khurasan, pretending he had occasion for him as an assistant in his councils. By this ill-treatment al-Mamun was so much provoked, that he resolved to come to an open rupture with his brother. A war soon after broke out between them. Tahsin ibn-Husain, the general of al-Mamun, laid siege to Baghdad, took it, and having seized al-Amin, cut off his head, and exposed it to public view in the streets of Baghdad. Afterwards he sent it to al-Mamun in Khurasan, together with the ring or seal of the khilafat, the sceptre and the imperial robe. At the sight of these, al-Mamun fell down on his knees, and returned thanks to God for his success, making the courier who brought the insignia a present of a million of dirhams. The death of al-Amin took place on the 6th October, 813 A.D., 6th Safar, 198 A.H. He was then 30 years of age, and had reigned but four years and some months.\n\nAlamayo, (Prince), the son of king Theodore of Abyssinia. After the fall of Magdala and the death of his father, 10th April, 1868, he was sent to England to be educated.\n\n'Alamgir I, (Emperor of Hindustan), surnamed Abdul-Zafar Muh-uddin Muhammad Aurangzeb, took the title of 'Alamgir on his accession to the throne. He was the third son of the emperor Shah Jahan, born on Sunday, 10th October, 1619 O.S., 11th Zil-kada, 1028 H. His mother's name was Arjmand Banu, surnamed Mumtaz Mahal. In his youth, he put on the appearance of religious sanctity, but in June, 1658, Ramzan, 1068 H., during his father's illness, he in conjunction with his brother Murad Bakhsh, seized Agra, and made his father prisoner. Murad was soon after imprisoned by 'Alamgir, who marched to Delhi, where he caused himself to be proclaimed emperor on the 21st July of the same year, 1st Zil-kada, 1069 H., but was not crowned till the first anniversary of his accession\u2014a circumstance which has introduced some confusion in the chronology of his reign. Soon after, he put Murad Bakhsh and his eldest brother the heir-apparent Dara Shikoh to death. He greatly enlarged his dominions, and became so formidable, that all Eastern princes sent ambassadors to him. He was an able prince, but a bigoted Sunnit, and attempted to force the Hindus to adopt that faith, destroying their temples, and levying the capitulation tax (jizya) from every Hindoo. The feudatory chiefs of Rajputana successfully resisted the impost. He died after a reign of 60 lunar years at Ahmadabad in the Dakhin, on Friday, the 21st of February, 1707 O.S., 28th Zil-ka'da, 1118 H., aged 90 lunar years and 17 days, and was interred in the court of the mausoleum of Shaikh Zain-uddin, in Khuldabad, 8 kos from the city of Aurangabad. After his death, he received the title of \"Hagrat Khuld-Makan,\" (i.e. He whose place is in paradise). He was married in the 19th year of his age to a daughter of Shahinawaz Khan, the son of Asaf Khan the prime minister of the emperor Jahangir, by whom he had 5 sons and 6 daughters. His eldest son, named Sultan Mohammad, died before his father; his second son was Mohammad Mu'azzam who succeeded him with the title of Shah 'Alam Bahadur Shah; the third 'Azam Shah was slain in battle fought against the latter; the fourth Mohammad Akbar, who revolted against his father, took refuge in Persia and died there; the fifth Kham Bakhsh who was also slain in battle.

He was, after a nominal reign of 5 years and some months, assassinated by the same person who had placed him on the throne, on Friday 29th November, 1739, N.S., 8th Rab'i II, 1173 H., and was interred in the platform before the mausoleum of the emperor Jahandar Shah. Son Ali Gauhar (afterwards Shah 'Alam) being then in Bengal, Mubin-ul-Sunnat, son of Kham Bakhsh, the son of the emperor Aurangzeb, was seated on the throne, with the title of Shah Jahin, and insulted by the empty name of emperor for some months, after which on the 10th October 1760 N.S., 29th Safar, 1174 H., the Marathas having plundered Delhi, prince Mirza Jawan Bakhsh, the son of Ali Gauhar, was placed on the throne by the Maratha chief Bhao, as regent to his father, who was still in Bengal.\n\nAlap Arsalan, vide Alp Arsalan.\n\nAlaptigin or Alptigin, (Chief of the tribe of the chief nobles of Bukhara, and governor of Khurasan during the reign of the house of Saiman.

He established a petty principality, of which Ghazni became the capital. He died A.D. 976, 366 A.H., when his son Abu-Bakr succeeded him; but that weak and dissipated prince survived his father but a short time; and the suffrage of all ranks gave the rule to Subuktigin, a chief in the service of Alaptigin in 977 A.D., 367 A.H.\n\nAl-Awsad, (Prince), an impostor, vide Musallama.\n\n'Ala-ud-daula, (Prince), the son of Bai-sanghar Mirza and grandson of Shahrukh Mirza, after whose death in A.D. 1447, he ascended the throne at Hird, but was soon driven from it by his uncle Ulugh Beg.

His residence was a castle between Damascus and Antioch, and was surrounded by a number of youths, whom he intoxicated with pleasures, and rendered subservient to his views, by promising still greater voluptuousness in the next world.

His elder brother Kut-uddin, prince of Ghori was publicly executed by his brother-in-law Bahram Shah of Gharni in 1119 A.D., 513 A.H. Saif-ud-daula, brother of the deceased took possession of Gharni in 1148 A.D., 543 A.H., but afterwards was defeated, taken prisoner and put to death by Bahram Shah in 1149 A.D., 544 A.H. When the mournful news of his brother's death reached 'Ala-uddin, he burnt with rage and being determined to take revenge, invaded Gharni with a great army. He defeated Bahram Shah, who fled to L\u00e1h\u00e1r, took possession of Gharni in 1152 A.D., 574 A.H., and gave up the city to flames, slaughter, and devastation for several days, on which account he is known by the epithet of \"Jah\u00e1n-s\u00f3s,\" or the burner of the world. He carried his animosity so far as to destroy every monument of the Gharni emperors with the exception of those of Sultan Mahmud, Mas'ud, and Ibrahim; but he defaced all the inscriptions, even of their times, from every public edifice. 'Ala-uddin died in the year 1166 A.D., 569 A.H., after a reign of 6 years, and was succeeded by his son Malik Saif-uddin or Saif-ud-daula who in little more than a year fell in battle with the Ghiza Turkmans.

He was a native of Dihli, and in the service of a Brahmanical astrologer named Kangoh, or Kangoh, enjoying high favor with the prince Muhammad Tughluk, afterwards king of Dihli. This Brahman assured Hasan that he perceived from his horoscope that he would rise to great distinction, and be eminently favored of the Almighty; and made him promise that if he ever should attain regal power, he would use the name of Kangoh and employ him as his minister of finance, a request with which Hasan readily complied. The governor of Daulatabad and others having revolted took possession of the place, and selected Hasan (who had then the title of Zafar Khan) and a j\u00e1gir in the Dakhin) to be their king. On Friday, the 3rd August, 1347 A.D., 24th Rab\u00ed' II, 748 A.H., they crowned him and raised him on the throne, with the title of 'Ala-uddin Hasan Kangoh Bahmani at Kulbarga, which place became the royal residence and capital of the first Muhammedan king of the Dakhin, and was named Ahsanabad. Towards the end of the reign of Muhammad Tughluk of Dihli, he subdued every part of the Dakhin previously subject to the throne of Dihli. The death of 'Ala-uddin Hasan happened 10 years, 10 months and 7 days after his accession to the throne, about the 10th of February 1368 A.D., 1st Rab\u00ed' I, 769 A.H.

He was the first Musalm\u00e1n king who made an attempt to conquer the Dakhin. He took the fort of Chitor in August, 1303 A.D., 3rd Muharram, 703 H. It is said that the empire never flourished so much as in his reign. Palaces, mosques, universities, baths, mausoleas, forts and all kinds of public and private buildings, seemed to rise as if by magic. Among the poets of his reign, we may record the names of Amir Khusrau, Khw\u00e1ja Hasan, Sadr-uddin 'Al\u00ed, Fakhr-uddin Khw\u00e1s, Ham\u00edd-uddin R\u00e1j\u00e1, Maul\u00e1n\u00e1 'Arif, 'Abdul-Hak\u00edm and Shih\u00e1b-uddin Sadr-Nishin.

(or 19th December, 1316 A.D.) after having reigned more than 20 years. He was buried in the tomb which he had constructed in\nhis life-time near the Manih\u00e1r Masjid in Old Dihl\u00ed. Amir Khuzrau in that part of his Diw\u00e1n, called \"Bakiya-i-Nak\u00edya\" says that he died on the 6th Shaww\u00e1l, 715 H., i.e., about the 30th December 1815 A.D. After his death, Malik N\u00e1fi K\u00e1f\u00edr, one of the eunuchs of the king, placed his youngest Sultan Shih\u00e1b-udd\u00edn 'Umar, who was then only seven years old, on the throne.

His collection of traditions on the Muhammadan religion, commonly called Sahih-al-Bukh\u00e1ri, is of the greatest authority of all that have ever been made; he called it \"Al-Sahih,\" i.e., genuine, because he separated the spurious ones from those that were authentic. He says, he has selected 7,276 of the most authentic traditions out of 10,000, all of which he looked upon to be true, having rejected 200,000 as false.

He was born 23 years before the Hijr\u012b, i.e., in the year 599 A.D., at the very temple itself. His mother's name was F\u00e1tima, daughter of Asad the son of H\u00e1s\u00edm. After the death of Muhammad, he was opposed in his attempts to succeed the prophet by 'U\u1e63m\u00e1n and Umar, and retired into Arabia where his mild and enlarged interpretation of the K\u00far'\u00e1n increased the number of his proselytes. After the death of 'U\u1e63m\u00e1n, the 3rd khalifa, he was acknowledged khalifa by the Egyptians and Arabians in July, 655 A.D., but in less than 6 years after, he was compelled to resign that title, and Mu'\u00e1wiya was proclaimed khalifa at Damascus. 'Ali was subsequently wounded by 'Abdur-Rahm\u00e1n ibn-Muljim in a mosque at Kufa, whilst engaged in his evening prayers, on Friday, the 22nd January, 661, A.D., 17th Ram\u00e1\u1e0d\u00e1n, 40 A.H., and died four days after.\n\n'Ali after the decease of his beloved F\u00e1tima, the daughter of the prophet, claimed the privilege of polygamy and had 18 sons and 18 daughters. The most renowned of these are the two sons of F\u00e1tima, viz., Husain and H\u00e1s\u00edm, as also Mohammad \u1e24ajj\u00ed, his another wife. Among the many surnames, or honorable titles bestowed upon 'Ali, are the following: \"Wasi\" which signifies \"legatee and heir;\" Murtagh, \"beloved by God;\" Asad-ullah-ul-Gh\u00e1lib, \"the victorious lion of God;\" Haidar, a \"lion;\" Sh\u00e1h Mard\u00e1n, \"king of men;\" Sher Khud\u00e1, \"the lion of God.\" His memory is still held in the highest veneration by the Muhammedans, who say that he was the first that embraced their religion. They say, moreover, that Muhammad, talking of him, said, \"'Ali is for me and I am for him; he stands to me in the same rank as Aaron did to Moses; I am the town in which all knowledge is shut up, and he is the gate of it.\" However, these great eulogies did not hinder his name, and that of all his family, from being cursed, and their persons from being excommunicated through all the mosques of the empire of the khalifas of the house of Umayya, from Mu'\u00e1wiya down to the time of 'Umar ibn-'Abdul-'Az\u00edz, who suppressed the solemn malediction. There were besides several khalifas of the house of 'Abb\u00e1s, who expressed a great aversion to 'Ali and all his posterity; such as Mu'tagid and Mutawakkil. On the other hand, the F\u00e1timite khalifas of Egypt caused his name to be added to that of Muhammad in the call to prayer, (az\u00e1n) which is chaunted from the turrets of the mosques. He is the first of the twelve Im\u00e1ms, eleven of whom were his descendants. Their names are as follows:\n\n1. 'Al\u00ed, the son of Ab\u00fa-T\u00e1lib.\n2.

In his 13th year he was carried away by some robbers as he was hunting, and sold to Ibrahim, a lieutenant of the Janissaries, at Grand Cairo, who treated him with kindness. Ali distinguished himself against the Arabs, but when his patron was basely assassinated in 1768, by Ibrahim the Circassian, he avenged his death, and slew the murderer with his own hand. This violent measure raised him enemies, and his flight to Jerusalem and to Ptolemais or Acre with difficulty saved him from the resentment of the Ottoman Porte, that had demanded his head. Time, however, paved the way to his elevation. Those who had espoused the cause of the Circassian were sacrificed to the public safety; and Ali recalled by the public voice, governed the country with benevolence and equity. In a battle fought against a rebellious Maniote to whom he had entrusted part of his army, Ali saw some of his troops desert, and unwilling to survive a defeat, he defended himself with the fury of a lion till he was cut down by a sabre and carried to the conqueror's tent, where eight days after he expired of his wounds, April 21st, 1773, in his 45th year, and left behind him a character unrivalled for excellence, for courage, and magnanimity.\n\n'Ali Bae, the titles by which he was known in the Muhammedan countries, were, al-Amir, al-Hakim, al-Fakih, al-Sharif, al-Hajj 'Ali Bae ibn Umm\u00e1n Bae al-Abbas, Kh\u0101d\u012bn Baitullah al-Har\u012bm, i.e., the prince, the learned, doctor of the law, of the blood of Muhammed, pilgrim, 'Ali Bae, son of Umm\u00e1n Bae, of the race of the Abbasides, servant of the house of God.

In June 1803 he sailed from Spain to Morocco, and travelled through Tripoli, Cyprus, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, and Turkey, and wrote a history of his travels, which was translated into English and published in London in the year 1816, entitled \"The Travels of Ali Bae.\" In his visit to the isle of Cyprus he surveyed some curious remains of antiquity that have been usually overlooked. Having been admitted in his character of a Muhammedan prince to sweep the interior of the Ka'ba at Mecca, the most sacred office that a Musalman can perform, and to visit it repeatedly, he has given, from personal inspection a more minute and exact account of the temple of Mecca than other travellers could lay before the public. His notice of the venerated mountain beyond Mecca, the last and principal object of the pilgrimage to that city, and his description of the interior of the Temple of Jerusalem, which no Christian is permitted to enter, is said to contain much new information.\n\n'Ali Bahadur, Naw\u00e1b of Banda, eldest son of Shamsher Bahadur I, and grandson of the Marhatta chief Baji Rao Peshwa I. He received the investiture of Bundelkhand from Nana Farnawas, the Puna minister, about the year 1790 A.D. and accompanied by his brother Gh\u00e1n\u00ed Bahadur, and supported by a powerful army, invaded Bundelkhand, but was opposed by Nana Arjun, the guardian of Bakhsh Singh a descendant of Raja Chaturdasi who falling in the contest, and Raja Bakhsh Singh being taken prisoner, Ali Bahadur acquired the whole of that part of the r\u0101j of Banda which belonged to Bakhsh Singh and all the r\u0101j of Panna. He reigned about 11 or 12 years, and as at the time of his death, which happened in 1801 or 1802 A.D., his eldest son Shamsher Bahadur II was absent at Pitha, his youngest son Zulfikar Ali was proclaimed (in violation of the title of his eldest brother) as his successor by his uncle Gh\u00e1n\u00ed Bahadur and his Diwan Himmat Bahadur Gosh\u00e1in. Gh\u00e1n\u00ed Bahadur, however, was soon after expelled by Shamsher Bahadur who took possession of the r\u0101j.\n\n'Ali Bahadur Khan, the last Naw\u00e1b of Banda and son of Zulfikar Ali Khan Bahadur. He is the author of a diwan and a masnavi called \"Mehr-ullah.\" He was removed for alleged complicity in the rebellion of 1857.\n\n'Ali Barid I, succeeded his father Amir Barid to the throne of Ahmadabad Bidar in the Dakhkan in the year 1562 A.D. and was the first of this family who assumed royalty. He died after a reign of more than 20 years in 1562 A.D., 970 A.H. and was succeeded by his son Ibrahim Barid.\n\n'Ali Barid II, succeeded his father Kasim Barid II in the government of Ahmadabad Bidar in 1572 A.D. and was deposed in 1609 by his relative Amir Barid II, who succeeded him, and was the last of this dynasty.\n\n'Ali Beg, a Pole, born of Christian parents. When young he was made prisoner by the Tartars and sold to the Turks, who educated him in the Muhammedan faith. He rose in the Turkish court, and was appointed interpreter to the Grand Signior, and translated the Bible and the English Catechism into the Turkish language. His great work is on the Liturgy of the Turks, their pilgrimages to Mecca, and other religious ceremonies, translated into Latin by Dr. Smith. He died 1675 A.D.\n\n'Ali Beg, (Mirza), a native of Badakhshan who held a high rank in the service of the emperor Akbar; and was honored with the office of 4,000 in the reign of Jahangir. He accompanied the emperor one day to visit the shrine of the celebrated saint, Shaikh Mainuddin Chishti at Ajmir, and happening to see the tomb of Shabtai Khan Kambu, he embraced it, and crying out with a loud voice, that, \"he, when living, was one of his oldest and best friends,\" gave up the ghost. This happened on the 11th of March, 1616 O.S., 2nd Rabi I, 1025 A.H.\n\n'Ali bin al-Husain al-Masa'udi al-Hudaili, the far-famed author of the Marji-us-Zahab, and who has been, with some justice, termed the Herodotus of the East, was also a writer on the Shia traditions. He died in 957 A.D., 346 A.H.\n'Ali Boya or Ali ibn Boya, entitled Im\u00e1d-ud-daula, the first of a race of kings of Fars and 'Ir\u00e1k. The flatterers of this family, which is called Dilam or D\u00ed\u00e1l\u00edma (from the name of their native village, Dilam) and B\u00f3ya or Buy\u00fata (from that of one of their ancestors named B\u00f3ya), trace their descent to the ancient kings of Persia; but the first of this race that history notices was a fisherman of Dilam whose name was B\u00f3ya. His eldest son, 'Ali Boya, was employed by governors of his native country named Y\u00e1k\u00fat, and was in the command of the chief part of his army, with which he encountered and defeated Y\u00e1k\u00fat, the governor of Isfah\u00e1n, and by the immense plunder that he obtained from that victory, he became at once a leader of reputation, and of power. He pursued Y\u00e1k\u00fat into Fars, defeated him again, and took possession of the whole of that province as well as those of Kirman, Kh\u00faz\u00edst\u00e1n and 'Ir\u00e1k in 933 A.D., 221 A.H. This chief was afterwards tempted by the weak and distracted state of the Khilaf\u00e1t or Caliphate, to a still higher enterprise: accompanied by his two brothers, Hasan and Ahmad, he marched to Baghd\u00e1d. The Khalif al-R\u00e1zi Bill\u00e1h fled, but was soon induced to return; and his first act was to heap honors on those who had taken possession of his capital. 'Ali B\u00f3ya, on agreeing to pay annually 600,000 dinars of gold, was appointed viceroy of Fars and 'Ir\u00e1k, with the rank of Amir-ul-Umr\u00e1, and the title of 'Im\u00e1d-ud-daula. His younger brother Ahmad, received the title of Ma\u00edz-ud-daula, and was nominated waz\u00edr to the khalif. Hasan, who was his second brother, received the title of Rukn-ud-daula, and acted, during the life of 'Ali B\u00f3ya, under that chief. 'Ali B\u00f3ya fixed his residence at Shir\u00e1z, and died on Sunday the 17th November, 949 A.D., 16th Jam\u00e1d I, 338 H., much regretted by his soldiers and subjects.

They were first entertained by Madan Sh\u00e1h, a Hind\u00fa chief of Seraili, (a small town in the north-west quarter of Rohilkhand) who by robbery and predatory excursions maintained a large party of banditti.

From the negligence of government and the weak state of the empire of D\u00edhl\u00ed in the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, he possessed himself of the district of Katir (now called from the residence of the Rohilas, Rohilkhand) and assumed independence of the royal authority. He was besieged in March, 1745 A.D., Safar 1158 A.H., in a fortress called Bankar and 'Aoul\u00e9 and taken prisoner, but was released after some time, and a jagir conferred on him.

On his arrival, he was received with the greatest distinction, and raised to the highest posts of honor. 'Ali\u0161er's palace was open to all men of learning: and notwithstanding that the reins of government were placed in his hands, in the midst of the weightiest affairs, he neglected no opportunity of improving both himself and others in the pursuit of knowledge. He was not only honored by his own Sult\u00e1n and his officers, but foreign princes also esteemed and respected him. After being employed in the capacity of diwan and prime minister for some time, love of study induced him to resign, and bidding a final adieu to public life, he passed the remainder of his days in composing Turkish and Persian works of which S\u00e1d\u00ed Khurr\u00e1za enumerates the names of no less than twenty-one. Daulat Sh\u00e1h the biographer, Mirkhund and his son Kh\u00e1ndam\u00edr, the historians, dedicated their works to him and amongst other poets, Minims who were cherished by his liberality may be mentioned the celebrated poet Jami. His collection of Odes in the Chaght\u00e1i or pure Turkish dialect, which he wrote under the poetical name of Naw\u00e1i, amounts to 10,000 couplets, while his parody of Niz\u00e1m's five poems, containing nearly 30,000 couplets, is universally admired by the cultivators of Turkish poetry, in which he is considered to be without a rival. In the Persian language also he wrote a collection of Odes, under the poetical name of F\u00e1ni or Fan\u00e1i, consisting of 6,000 distiches. 'Ali\u0161er was born in the year 1440 A.D., 844 A.H., and died on Sunday the 6th of December, 1500 A.D., 15th Jam\u00e1d I, 906 A.H., five years before his royal friend and master Sult\u00e1n Husain Mirz\u00e1. Kh\u00e1ndam\u00edr has recorded the year of his death in an affectionate chronogram: \"His highness the Amir, the asylum of divine guidance, in whom all the marks of mercy were conspicuous, has quitted the thorny brake of the world, and fled to the rose-garden of pity.

There is a heroic ballad sung or recited by the Hind\u00fa sepoys in a kind of monotonous, but not unmusical sort of chaunt, accompanied by a sotto voce beat of the dh\u00f3li, which rise to a constrepito in the pause between the verses. Whoever has resided in a military cantonment must have frequently observed the sepoys, when disengaged from military duty, collected in small knots, listening to one of the party reciting some poem or tale to a deeply interested audience. The subject of this lay is the prowess of 'Alha', the raja of Mahoba, a town in Bundelkhand, of which extensive ruins remain. The hero is described as the terror of the Muhammadans; his triumphs over whom are attributed not only to his own valour, but the favor of the goddess Kali, whom he had propitiated by the offering of his life. There are many songs, it is said, of this prince, and his brother Udal, a warrior of equal estimation; but they are preserved only traditionally by the Powars, and their amateur students. The verses are in Bhalha.\n\nAl-Hadi, the fourth khalif of the house of 'Abb\u00e1s succeeded his father al-Mahd\u00ed on the 4th of August, 785 A.D., 23rd Muharram, 169 H., to the throne of Baghdad. He reigned one year and one month, and having formed a design to deprive his younger brother H\u00e1run-al-Rashid of his right of succession and even to assassinate him, was poisoned by his prime minister about the month of September 786 A.D., Rab\u00ed I, 170 A.H. On his death his brother the celebrated H\u00e1run-al-Rashid ascended the throne.\n\nAl-Hakm, also called ibn Abd\u00fal Hakm, an Arabian author who (according to the chronological arrangement of the Arab authorities by Howard Vyse and Dr. Sprenger, in the former's second volume of 'The Pyramids of Gizeh') lived about 1450 A.D., or six hundred years after the death of the khalif al-Mam\u00fan of Baghdad, but by a manuscript note recorded by a gentleman of the British Museum, (1868) it appears that al-Hakm was nearly contemporary with that prince who flourished between 813 and 842 A.D. Al-Hakm writes that the Great Pyramid in Egypt was built by a certain antediluvian king Saurid, and filled by him chiefly with celestial spheres and figures of the stars, together with the perfumes used in their worship; and that khalif\u00e1 al-Mam\u00fan, found the body of a man deposited, with jewels, arms, and golden clothing, in the coffin, when he broke into the king's chamber of the Great Pyramid. But neither Ab\u00fa Mi\u015bhar Jafar bin Muhammad Balkhi, who wrote in about 890 A.D. nor ibn Khurdalbeh, in 920 A.D. have one word about al-Mam\u00fan, or any opening of the pyramid. But when we descend to Mas\u00e1idi, in 987 A.D. he, after an astonishing amount of romancing on what took place at the building of the pyramids 300 years before the Flood, mentions that not al-Mam\u00fan, but his father, khalifa H\u00e1run-al-Rashid, attempted to break into the Great Pyramid, and after penetrating 20 cubits, found a vessel containing 1000 coins of the finest gold, each coin being twice in weight, and making up a sum which exactly repaid the cost of his operations; at which, it is added, he greatly wondered. About the year 1170 A.D. or 340 years after al-Mam\u00fan's age, that prince is mentioned by Ab\u00fa Abd-ullah Mu\u1e25ammad bin Abdur Rah\u00edm Alk\u0101ni, who states that he was informed that those who went into the upper parts of the Great Pyramid in the time of al-Mam\u00fan, came to a small passage, containing the image of a man in green stone, and within that a human body with golden armour &c. &c.\n\nAl-Hasan, an Arabian who wrote on optics, about the year 1100 A.D.\n\nAlif bin Nur Kashani, author of another \"Malla'-ul-Anvar\", besides the one of the same name written by Mull\u00e1 Husain W\u00e1ez.

He was a contemporary of Sult\u00e1n Mu\u1e25ammad of Ghazni; reigned 41 lunar years and 3 months, and died in 1031 A.D., 422 A.H.

He succeeded his father K\u00e1dir Billah to the throne of Bagh\u00e1d\u00e1d in 1031 A.D., 422 A.H., reigned 44 lunar years and 8 months, and died in 1076 A.D., 467 A.H., which was soon after Sult\u00e1n Maliksh\u00e1h the Saljuqu\u00ed had ascended the throne of Persia, and as that monarch was the real master of the empire, the nomination of a successor was deferred till he was consulted. He deputed a son of his prime minister Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk to Bagh\u00e1d\u00e1d with orders to raise al-Mukta\u1e0d\u00ed the grandson of al-K\u00e1'im to the (nominal) rank of the commander of the faithful.\n\nAl-Kaim, second khalif of the F\u00e1'imite race of Barbary; he succeeded his father Obeid-ill\u00e1h al-Mahd\u00ed A.D. 924, 312 A.H. During his reign we read of nothing remarkable, except the revolt of Ye\u1e63id ibn Kondat, a man of mean extraction. Al-K\u00e1'em reigned nearly 12 years and died in A.D. 946, 334 A.H.

He had reigned only one year five months and twenty-one days, when his waz\u00edr ibn Makl\u00e1 deprived him of his sight with a hot iron on Wednesday the 23rd April, 934 A.D.,\n6th Jamad I, 322 A. H. and raised al-Razi Billah the son of Mukhtadir to the throne. It is said that al-Kahir, after this, as long as he lived, was obliged to beg for charity in the mosque of Baghdad, calling out to the people that assembled there, \"Have pity and give charity to one, who had once been your khalifa.\"\n\n'Al-Kama, \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u0647, son of Kya was one of the pupils of Abdullah bin Mas'ud, and an eminent man.

He is the author of a celebrated collection of tracts on pure and mixed mathematics, entitled Durrat-at-Taj.\n\nAl-Mahdi, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062f\u06cc, the third khalifa of the race of Abbas, succeeded his father Abu Ja'far al-Mansur to the throne of Baghdad, and was inaugurated on Sunday the 8th of October, 775 A.D., 6th Zil Hijja, 158 A.H. From the accession of al-Mahdi to the year 781 A.D., 164 A.H., the most remarkable event was the rebellion of al-Makna (or al-Makna) which see. All this time war had been carried on with the Greeks, but without any remarkable success on either side. But after the suppression of the rebellion of al-Makna, the khalifa ordered his son Harun al-Rashid to penetrate into the Greek territories with an army of 95,000 men. Harun, then, having entered the dominions of the empress Irene, defeated one of her commanders that advanced against him; after which he laid waste several of the imperial provinces with fire and sword, and even threatened the city of Constantinople itself. By this the empress was so terrified, that she purchased a peace with the khalifa by paying him an annual tribute of 70,000 pieces of gold, which for the present at least, delivered her from the depredations of these barbarians. After the signing of the treaty, Harun returned home laden with spoils and glory. This year (i.e. the 164th year of the Hijri or 781 A.D.) according to some of the oriental historians, the sun one day a little after his rising, totally lost his light in a moment without being eclipsed, when neither any fog nor any cloud of dust appeared to obscure him. This frightful darkness continued till noon, to the great astonishment of the people settled in the countries where it happened. Al-Mahdi was poisoned, though undesignedly, by one of his concubines, named Hasana. She had designed to destroy one of her rivals whom she imagined to have too great an ascendancy over the khalifa, by giving her a poisoned pear. This the latter, not suspecting anything, gave to the khalifa; who had no sooner eaten it than he felt himself in exquisite torture, and soon after expired. This event took place on the eve of Thursday the 4th of August, 785 A.D., 28rd Muharram, 169 H. In a village called Ar Radd in the dependencies of Masabadan. He was succeeded by his eldest son al-Hadi.\n\nAl-Mahdi, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u062f\u06cc, a khalifa of Barbary, vide Obeid-ullah al-Mahdi and Muhammad al-Mahdi.\n\nAl-Makna, or al-Makanna, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u06a9\u0646\u0646, a famous impostor of Khurasan who lived in the reign of al-Mahdi the khalifa of Baghdad. His true name was Hakam ibn Hasham, and had been an under secretary to Abu Muslim governor of that province. He afterwards turned soldier, and passed thence into Mawarunnahr, where he gave himself out as a prophet. The name of al-Makna, as also that of al-Burkaf, that is, the veiled, he received from his custom of covering his face with a veil or griddle mask, to conceal his deformity; he having lost an eye in the wars, and being otherwise of a despicable appearance, and a stutterer; though his followers pretended he did this for the same reason that Moses did, viz., lest the splendor of his countenance should dazzle the eyes of his beholders. In some places he made a great many proselytes, deluding the people with a number of juggling tricks which they swallowed as miracles, and particularly by causing the appearance of a moon to rise out of a well for many nights together; whence he was also called in the Persian tongue, Sazinda Mah, or the Moon-maker. This wretch, not content with being reckoned a prophet, arrogated to himself divine honors; pretending that the Deity resided in his person. He had first, he said, assumed the body of Adam, then that of Noah and subsequently of many other wise and great men. The last human form he pretended to have adopted was that of Abu Muslim a prince of Khurasan, from whom it proceeded to him. At last this impostor raised an open rebellion against the khalifa, and made himself master of several fortified places in Khurasan, so that al-Mahdi was obliged to send one of his generals with an army against him about the year 780 A.D., 163 H. Upon the approach of the khalifa's troops, al-Makna retired into one of his strong fortresses which he had well provided for a siege. But being closely besieged by the khalifa's forces, and seeing no possibility of escaping, he gave poison in wine to his whole family and all that were with him in the castle; when they were dead, he burnt their bodies, together with all their furniture, provisions, and cattle; and lastly he threw himself into the flames. He had promised his followers, that his soul should transmigrate into the form of an old man riding on a greyish colored beast; and that after so many years he would return and give them the earth for their possession; which ridiculous expectation kept the sect in being for several years. English readers will remember the use made of this story by the author of Lalla Rookh.\n\nAl-Mamun, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u06cc\u0646, surnamed 'Abdullah, was the seventh khalifa of the race of the Abbasides, and the second son of Harun al-Rashid. He was proclaimed khalifa at Baghdad on the 6th October, 813 A.D., 6th Safar, 198 A.H., the day on which his brother al-Amin was assassinated. He conferred the government of Khurasan upon Tahir ibn Husain his general, and his descendants with almost absolute and unlimited power. This happened in the year 814 A.D., 205 A.H., from which time the most deadly dismemberment of that province from the empire of the khalifa. During the reign of this khalifa nothing remarkable happened; only the African Moslems invaded the island of Sicily, which they made themselves master of several places. Al-Mamun conquered part of Crete, had the best Greek writers translated into Arabic, and made a collection of the best authors. He also calculated a set of astronomical tables and founded an academy at Baghdad. In Khurasan he made Tus, at that time the capital of the kingdom, his place of residence. Under his patronage Khurasan became the resort of learned men; and the city of Tus, the great rival of Baghdad. He died of a surfeit on the 18th of August, 833 A.D., 17th Rajab 218 A.H., after a reign of 20 years and some months in Asia Minor, aged 48 years, and was buried at Tarsus a city on the frontiers\nof Asia Minor. His wife named B\u00far\u00e1n, daughter of Hasan ibn Sahl his prime minister, outlived him 60 years, and died on Tuesday the 22nd September, 884 A.D., 27th Rab\u00ed I., 271 A.H., aged 60 years. Al-M\u00e1d\u00edn was succeeded by his brother al-Mo'tasim Billah.\n\nAl-Mansur, the 2nd khalif of Barbary of the Fatimites race, vide Ism\u00e1\u00e9l, surnamed al-Mansur.\n\nAl-Mansur, whose former name was Abd Ja'far, was called al-Mansur, the victorious, by his overcoming his enemies. He was the second khalif of the noble house of Banu Abb\u00e1s or Abbasides, and succeeded to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his brother Ab\u00fal Abb\u00e1s surnamed al-Saff\u00e1h, in 754 A.D., 136 A.H. He was opposed by his uncle, 'Abdull\u00e1h son of Ali, who caused himself to be proclaimed khalif at Damascus, but was defeated by al-Mansur's general, Ab\u00fa Muslim. He laid the foundation of the city of Baghdad on the banks of the Tigris in 762 A.D. and finished it four years after. He was a prince of extraordinary talent and taste, and an ardent lover of science and literature. He got the Pahlavi copy of Pilpay's Fables translated into Arabic. In the year 776 A.D., 158 A.H., the khalif set out from Baghdad in order to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca; but being taken ill on the road, he expired at Bir Maim\u00fan, whence his body was carried to Mecca; where, after 100 graves had been dug, that his sepulchre might be concealed, he was interred, having lived, according to some 63, according to others 68 years, and reigned 22 lunar years. He is said to have been extremely covetous, and to have left in his treasury 600,000,000 dirhams, and 24,000,000 dinars. He is reported to have paid his cook by assigning him the heads and legs of the animals dressed in his kitchen, and to have obliged him to procure at his own expense all the fuel and vessels he had occasion for. He was succeeded by his son al-Mahdi. A Christian physician, named Bactshus, was very eminent at the court of al-Mansur, who understanding that he had an old infirm woman for his wife, sent him three beautiful Greek girls and 3,000 dinars as a present. Bactshus sent back the girls and told the khalif that his religion prohibited his having more than one wife at a time; which pleased the khalif so much, that he loaded him with presents, and permitted him, at his earnest request, to return to his own country of Khuras\u00e1n.\n\nAl-Mo'tasim Billah, the fifteenth khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, was the son of al-Mutawakkil Billah. He was raised to the throne of Baghdad by the Turks after the murder of al-Muh\u00e1dhi in 870 A.D., 256 A.H. This year the prince of the Zanj\u00e1ns, Ali or al-H\u00e1dh, made incursions to the very gates of Baghdad, doing prodigious mischief wherever he passed. In the year 874 A.D., Ya'k\u00fab-ibn-Lys having taken Khuras\u00e1n from the descendants of T\u00e1hir, attacked and defeated Muhammed ibn Wasil (who had killed the khalif's governor of Fars, and afterwards made himself master of that province) seizing on his riches, where he found a sum of money amounting to 40,000,000 dirhams. In the year 875 A.D., 255 A.H., Ahmad ibn T\u00e1lan rebelled against the khalif and set up for himself in Egypt. There were now four independent powers in the Moslem dominions, besides the house of Umm\u00e1ya in Spain; viz. The African Moslems, or Ashlabites, who had for a long time acted independently; Ahmad ibn T\u00e1lan in Syria and Egypt; Ya'k\u00fab ibn Lys in Khuras\u00e1n, and al-H\u00e1dh in Arabia and Ir\u00e1n. In the year 883 A.D., 270 A.H., al-H\u00e1dh was defeated and slain by al-Muw\u00e1fiq the khalif's brother and coadjutor, who ordered his head to be cut off, and carried through a great part of that region which he had so long disturbed. In the year 891 A.D., 278 A.H., the Karmatians first made their appearance in the Moslem empire, and gave almost continual disturbance to the khalifs and their subjects. Al-Mo'tasim reigned 22 lunar years 11 months and some days, and died in the year 892 A.D., 279 A.H. He was succeeded by his nephew al-Mo'tasim Billah the son of al-Muw\u00e1fiq.\n\nAl-Mo'tasim Billah, the fourth son of Har\u00fan-al-Rash\u00edd, and the eighth khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s. He succeeded to the throne by virtue of his brother al-M\u00e1d\u00edn's express nomination of him to the exclusion of his own son al-Abbas, and his other brother al-K\u00e1sim, who had been appointed by Har\u00fan-al-Rash\u00edd. In the beginning of his reign 893 A.D., 218 A.H., he was obliged to employ the whole force of his empire against one B\u00e1bak, who had been for a considerable time in rebellion in Persia and Pontus, \u00cdrak, and had taken upon himself the title of a prophet. He was however, defeated and slain. In the year 898 A.D., 223 A.H., the Greek emperor Theophilus invaded the khalif's territories, where he behaved with the greatest cruelty, and by destroying Sozopolis, the place of al-Mo'tasim's nativity, notwithstanding his earnest entreaties to the contrary, occasioned the terrible distinction of Amorium. He is said to have been so robust, that he once carried a burden of 1,000 pounds weight several paces. As the people of Baghdad disturbed him with frequent revolts and commotions, he took the resolution to abandon that city, and build another for his own residence. The new city he built was first called S\u00e1mira, and afterwards S\u00e1maran\u00ed, (for that which gives pleasure at first sight) and stood in the Arabian \u00cdrak. He was attached to the opinion of the Mataz\u00e1lit\u00e9s who maintain the creation of the Kur\u00e1n; and both he and his predecessor cruelly persecuted those who believed it to be eternal. Al-Mo'tasim died on Thursday the 6th January, 842 A.D., 18th Rab\u00ed I., 227 H. He reigned 8 years 8 months and 8 days, was born in the 8th month (Shaban) of the year, was the 8th khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, ascended the throne in the 218th year of the Hijri, died on the 18th of Rabi I., lived 48 years, fought 8 battles, built 8 palaces, begot 8 sons and 8 daughters, had 8,000 slaves, and had 8,000,000 dinars, and 80,000 dirhams in his treasury at his death, whence the oriental historians gave him the name of al-Musamman, or the Octonary. He was the first khalif that added to his name the title of Billah, equivalent to the Dri Gratia of Christian sovereigns. He was succeeded by his son al-W\u00e1thiq or W\u00e1\u0161ik Billah.\n\nAl-Mo'tasim Billah, the son of al-Muw\u00e1fiq, the son of al-Mutawakkil Billah, was the sixteenth khalif of the race of Abbas. He came to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his uncle al-Mo'tasim Billah in 892 A.D., 279 A.H. In the first year of his reign, he demanded in marriage the daughter of Khamaraw\u00eda, Sult\u00e1n or khalif of Egypt, the son of Ahmad ibn T\u00e1lan; which was agreed to by him with the utmost joy, and their nuptials were solemnized with great pomp in the year 895 A.D., 282 A.H. He carried on a war with the Karmatians, but very unsuccessfully, his forces being defeated with great slaughter, and his general al-Abb\u00e1s taken prisoner. The khalif some time after his marriage granted to Kh\u00e1rid\u00edn, son of Khamaraw\u00eda, the perpetual prefecture of \u00c1rv\u00e1s\u00e1 and Khamar\u00edn, which he annexed to that of Egypt and Syria, upon condition that he paid him an annual tribute of 45,000 dinars. He reigned 9 years 8 months and 25 days, and died in 902 A.D., 289 A.H. His son al-Muktafi Billah succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mughira, the son of Sayyid and governor of Kufa in the time of Mu'\u00e1w\u00eda the first khalif of the house of Umm\u00e1ya. He was an active man, and of very good parts; he had lost one of his eyes at the battle of Yersnouk, though some say that it was with looking at an eclipse. By the followers of Ali he was accounted to be of the wrong party, and one of the chief of them. For thus they reckon, there are five elders on Ali's side; Muhammed, Ali, F\u00e1tima, Hasan and Husain; and to these are opposed, Ab\u00fa Bakr, 'Umar, Mu\u00e1wiya, Amr\u00e1 and al-\nAl-Muhtadi\n\nMughira. He died in the year 670 A.D., 50 A.H., at Kufa. A great plague had been raging in the city, which made him retire from it; but returning upon its violence abating, he nevertheless caught it, and died of it.\n\nAl-Muhtadi, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631, the fourteenth khalif of the Abbasids, was the son of one of al-Wathik's concubines named Kurb. Al-Muhtadi was raised to the throne of Baghdad after the deposition of al-Mutta'ib Billah in 869 A.D., 255 A.H. The beginning of his reign is remarkable for the irruption of the Zanjians, a people of Nubia, Ethiopia, and the country of Caffres, into Arabia, where they penetrated into the neighbourhood of Basra and Kufa. The chief of this gang of robbers was Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Abdul Rahman, also called al-Habib, who falsely gave himself out to be of the family of Ali ibn Abu Talib. This made such an impression upon the Shias in those parts, that they flocked to him in great numbers; which enabled him to seize upon the cities of Basra and Ramla, and even to pass the Tigris at the head of a formidable army. In the year 870 A.D., 256 A.H., Al-Muhtadi was barbarously murdered by the Turks who had raised him to the throne. He reigned only eleven months and was succeeded by al-Mo'tamid.\n\nAl-Mukhtar, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631, a celebrated Muhammadan chief who had beaten all the generals of the khalifas Yazid, Marwan, and Abdul Malik, and had made himself sole master of Babylonian Irak, whereof Kufa was the capital. He persecuted all those he could lay his hands on, who were not of Husain's party; he never pardoned any one of those who had declared themselves enemies to the family of the prophet, nor those who, as he believed, had dipped their hands in Husain's blood or that of his relations. He sent an army against Ebu-ud-din the son of Zayd, who was sent by the khalif Abdul Malik towards Kufa with leave to plunder it for three days, and slew him in battle in August, 686 A.D., Muharram, 67 A.H. Al-Mukhtar was killed at Kufa in a battle fought with Musa'b the brother of Abdullah the son of Zuber, governor of Basra, in the month of April, 687 A.D., Ramzan, 67 A.H., in the 67th year of his age. It is said that he killed nearly 60,000 men.\n\nAl-Muktadi Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u062a\u062f\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, surnamed Abul Kasim Abd-ullah, the son of Muhammad, and grandson of al-Kem Billah, was raised to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his grandfather in 1075 A.D., 467 A.H., by orders of Sultan Malikshah Saljuqi who was then the real master of the empire. He was the 27th khalif of the race of Abbas, reigned 19 lunar years and 6 months and died in 1094 A.D., 487 A.H. His death induced Barkayaruk the Saljuqi, the reigning Sultan of Persia, whose brother Mahmud had died about the same period, to go to Baghdad, where he confirmed al-Mustansir the son of the late khalif as his successor, and was himself hailed by the new lord of the faithful, as Sultan of the empire.\n\nAl-Mukhtadir Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631, the eighteenth khalif of the house of Abbas, was the son of al-Mo'tamid Billah. He succeeded his brother al-Muktafi to the throne of Baghdad in 908 A.D., 295 A.H. He reigned 24 lunar years 2 months and 7 days, and was murdered by a sucuri on the 29th October, 932 A.D., 25th Shawwal, 320 H. He was succeeded by his brother al-Kahir Billah.\n\nAl-Muktafi Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0641\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, was the seventeenth khalif of the house of Abbas who reigned in Baghdad. He succeeded his father al-Mo'tamid Billah in 902 A.D., 289 A.H., and proved a warlike and successful prince. He gained several advantages over the Carmatians, but was not able to reduce them. The Turks, however, having invaded the province of Mawarunnahr, were defeated with great slaughter; after which al-Muktafi carried on a successful war against the Greeks, from whom he took Seleucia. After this he invaded Syria and Egypt, which provinces he recovered from the house of Ahmad ibn Tulun in 905 A.D., 292 A.H.; he then renewed the war with success against the Greeks and Carmatians. Al-Muktafi died in 908 A.D., 295 A.H., after a reign of about six years and a half. He was the last of the khalifs who made any figure by their warlike exploits. His successors al-Mukadir, al-Kahir and al-Razi were so distressed by the Carmatians and numberless usurpers who were every day starting up, that by the 326th year of the Hijri 937 A.D., they had nothing left but the city of Baghdad.\n\nAl-Muktafi Bi-amr-illah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0641\u064a \u0628\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, the son of al-Mustazhir was the 31st khalif of the house of Abbas. He succeeded his nephew al-Rashid in A.D. 1136, 580 A.H., reigned about 24 lunar years and died in 1160 A.D., 555 A.H., leaving his kingdom to his son al-Mustanjid.\n\nAl-Mustasli Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, the sixth Fatimite khalif succeeded his father al-Mustansir Billah in the government of Egypt and Syria. During his reign, the power of that dynasty was impaired, and its authority weakened, their political influence having ceased in most of the Syrian cities, and the provinces of that territory having fallen into the possession of the Turkmans on one hand, and the Franks on the other. This people (the Crusaders) entered Syria and encamped before Antioch in the month of October, 1097 A.D., Zil-kada 490 A.H.; they obtained possession of it on the 20th June, 1098, 16th Rajab, 491 A.H.; the following year they took Maaratun Noman, and in the month of July, 1099, Sha'ban, 492 A.H., they became masters of Jerusalem, after a siege of more than 40 days. This city was taken on a Friday morning; during the ensuing week, a great multitude of Moalims perished, and upwards of 70,000 were slain in the Masjid al-Aksa (or mosque of Umar)\u2014al-Mustasli was born at Cairo on the 24th August, 1076, 20th Muharram, 469 A.H., proclaimed khalif on Thursday the 28th of December, 1094, 18th Zil-hijja 497 A.H., and died in Egypt on the 10th December, 1101 A.D., 16th Safar, 495 A.H. His son Amar bi Akhdam-ullah Abu Ali Mansur succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mustasim Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0635\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, surnamed Abu Ahmad Abdullah, was the thirty-seventh and last khalif of the race of Abbas. He succeeded his predecessor al-Mustansir to the throne of Baghdad in 1142 A.D., 610 A.H. In his time Halak\u00fc Khan Tartar, emperor of the Mughals and grandson of the great conqueror Changiz Khan, besieged Baghdad for two months, and having taken that place, seized al-Mustasim and his four sons whom he put to most cruel death with 800,000 of its inhabitants. Halak\u00fc Khan was very desirous of seizing upon Baghdad, and of adding the whole kingdom of Mesopotamia to his already vast and numerous conquests; but, partly on account of his own scruples, and partly from fear of offending the prejudices of his Sunni followers, who were all of the same faith with the khalif, he refrained for a time from entering the sacred dominion of one who was considered as the head of their holy religion, and the true representative of their beloved prophet. But the glorious days of the house of Banu Abbas had almost been numbered, the effeminate Mustasim had personal vices enough to lead to and excuse the final extinction of his race! Ibn al-Kama, his prime minister (who hated him more than any other of his oppressed subjects) from within, and Nasir-uddin Tasi, the successor of the Mughal prince (who owed him an old grudge) from without, urged the conqueror to the gates of Baghdad. Nasir-uddin had a few years before been at Baghdad seeking shelter from persecution, when he was introduced to Mustasim, the latter asked him to what country he belonged? \"Tus,\"\nplease your holiness,\" answered Nasir-uddin. \"Art thou of the asses, or of the oxen of Tus?\" said the khalif (meaning the two principal branches of the Shia faith\u2014Akhbaris and Usulis). Mortified as the illustrious refugee was at this inhospitable insult, he still submissively answered, \"Of the oxen of Tus, please your highness.\" \"Where, then, are thy horns?\" said the insolent buffoon. \"I have them not with me,\" replied Nasir-uddin, \"but, if your holiness permit, I will go and fetch them.\" \"Make haste, hence, then, thou deformed animal,\" said the khalif, \"and never again appear in my presence in so imperfect a state!\" Nasir-uddin kept his promise well, for, at the moment when Baghdad was on the point of being surrendered, and the khalif driven to the last extremity, he sent him a message to the effect that the ox of Tus was at the gate with his horns, and inquiring, when it would please his holiness to receive him? Nasir-uddin had in the city another old offender, whom he was anxious also to chastise. This was ibn Hajjib, also one of the khalif's ministers, and a person of great reputation for his learning; but being an Arrian Sumi, and a very bigoted one too, he had behaved still more cruelly than his master to the defeated Persians, since when he sought protection of Baghdad. Ibn Hajjib having been seized with depression of spirits, the physicians had recommended him (and the priests had granted him dispensation) to take occasionally, a little wine. This happened when Nasir-uddin was at Baghdad. One day, ibn Hajjib feeling himself particularly melancholy, and having, in consequence, taken a larger dose than usual, he became unusually merry, and requested Nasir-uddin to accompany him on the Tigria. Having reached the middle of the stream, he stopped the boat, and produced the several volumes of Nasir-uddin's works, which the learned refugee had presented to the khalif\u2014some of them in the original manuscript, and not yet transcribed, and in the presence of their anxious authors, he threw them all, one after another, into the river, with such spiteful force, that the water was splashed about in every direction; when turning himself, on each occasion, to his mortified guest, he exclaimed with a sarcastic smile of triumph, \"How wonderfully it bubbles!\" When the turn of Nasir-uddin came, he, too, gave full vent to his revenge. He ordered ibn Hajjib to be cased up to his neck, in an ox's hide, just taken off the animal, and, having filled the skin with air, he laid it for a few hours in the sun, till it became quite dry, and sounded like a drum. Then the victor advanced close to his half exhausted enemy, gave him a kick of triumph, and, as he rolled on the ground, exclaimed, \"How wonderfully it rattles!\" This melancholy event took place on Sunday the 10th of February, 1258 A.D., 4th Safar, 656 A.H., from which time Baghdad was added to the other conquered provinces of this proud emperor. Al-Mustaa'im reigned 15 lunar years and 7 months.\n\nAl-Mustaa'in Billah, the son of Muhammad, the son of al-Mustaa'im Billah was the twelfth khalif of the race of Abbas. He ascended the throne of Baghdad in 862 A.D., 248 A.H., after the death of his cousin or brother al-Mustansar Billah, but was forced to abdicate the throne in 866 A.D., 252 A.H., by his brother al-Mustazir Billah, who afterwards caused him to be privately murdered.\n\nAl-Mustakfi Billah, was the 22nd khalif of the Abbaside family, and the son of al-Muktafi the son of al-Mustanar Billah. He succeeded his uncle al-Muttafi in 946 A.D., 333 A.H., reigned in Baghdad one year and four months, and was deposed by his wazir in 946 A.D., 334 A.H. After him al-Mutin' Billah was raised to the throne.\n\nAl-Mustansir Billah, the son of Tahir, was the fifth khalif of Egypt of the Fatimite race. He succeeded his father A.D. 1036, and with the assistance of a Turk named Basasiri, conquered Baghdad and imprisoned al-Ka'em Billah about the year 1054 A.D., and for a year and half was acknowledged the only legitimate chief of all the Musalmans. Basasiri was defeated and killed by Tughral Beg A.D. 1059, 487 A.H. Basasiri. Al-Mustansar died in 1094, having reigned 60 years; and was succeeded by his son al-Mustaa'im Billah Abul Kaisim.\n\nAl-Mustansir Billah I, the eleventh khalif of the race of Abbas, ascended the throne of Baghdad after the murder of his father al-Mutawakkil in December 861 A.D., Shawwal, 247 A.H., and had reigned only six months, when he was cut off by the hand of death in 862 A.D., 248 A.H. He was succeeded by his cousin al-Mustaa'im Billah.\n\nAl-Mustansir Billah II, surnamed Abu Ja'far al-Mansur, ascended the throne of Baghdad after the death of his father al-Tahir, in 1226 A.D., 623 A.H. He was the 36th khalif of the house of Abbas, reigned about 17 years, and died in 1242 A.D., 640 A.H., leaving his kingdom to his son al-Mustaa'im Billah the last of the khalifs.\n\nAl-Mustanjid Billah, the thirty-second khalif of the race of Abbas, succeeded to the throne of Baghdad after the death of his father al-Muktafi, in 1160 A.D., 555 A.H., reigned 11 lunar years and died in 1171 A.D., 566 A.H., when his son al-Mustazi succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mustashrid Billah, the twenty-ninth khalif of the Abbaside family, succeeded his father al-Mustazahr to the throne of Baghdad in 1118 A.D., 512 A.H. It is related by ibn Khallik\u00e1n that when Sultan Masud the son of Muhammad the son of Malikshah Saljuji was encamped outside of the town of Maragha in Azurbayjan, al-Mustashrid was then with him, and on Thursday the 28th or according to ibn Mustaufi, the 14th or 28th Zil'kada 529 A.H. (corresponding with the 24th August or 7th September, 1135 A.D.) a band of assassins broke into the khalif's tent and murdered him. Al-Mustashrid reigned 17 lunar years and some months, and was succeeded by his son al-Rashid Billah.\n\nAl-Mustazhir Billah, the son of al-Muktafi, was the twenty-eighth khalif of the dynasty of Abbas. He was placed on the throne of Baghdad after the death of his father in 1094 A.D., 487 A.H., by Barakaray Saljuji, the Sultan of Persia. He reigned 25 lunar years and some months, and at his death which happened in the year 1118 A.D., 512 A.H., he was succeeded by his son al-Mustashrid.\n\nAl-Mustaa'im Bi-amr-illah, the thirty-third khalif of the Abbaside family, succeeded his father al-Mustanjad to the throne of Baghdad in 1171 A.D., 566 A.H. He reigned about seven years and died in 1179 A.D., 575 A.H., when his son al-Nasir Billah succeeded him.\n\nAl-Mutaazz Billah, the son of al-Mutawakkil, was the thirteenth khalif of the race of Abbas. He deposed his brother al-Mustain in 866 A.D., 252 A.H., and having caused him to be murdered privately, ascended the throne of Baghdad. He did not, however, long enjoy the dignity of which he had so iniquitously possessed himself, being deposed by the Turkish militia (who now began to set up and depose khalifs as they pleased) in the year 869 A.D., 255 A.H. After his deposition, he was sent under an escort from Sarr Munras to Baghdad, where he died of thirst and hunger, after a reign of three years and about seven months. The fate of this khalif was peculiarly hard: the Turkish towns had mutinied for their pay; and al-Mutaazz not having money to satisfy their demands, applied to his mother named Kabina for 50,000 dinars. This she refused, telling him that she had\nno money at all, although it afterwards appeared that she was possessed of immense treasure. After his deposition, however, she was obliged to discover them, and even deposit them in the hands of the new khalif al-Mubtadi'. They consisted of 1,000,000 dinars, a bughal of emeralds, and another of pearls, and three pounds and three quarters of rubies of the colour of fire.\n\nAl-Mutia' Billah, the twenty-third khalif of the race of Abb\u00e1s was the son of al-Mukta'dir Billah. He ascended the throne of Baghdad after al-Mustakfi in 946 A.D., 334 A.H., reigned 29 lunar years and 4 months and died in 974 A.D., 363 A.H. His son al-Taya' succeeded him.\n\nAl-Muttaki Billah, the son of al-Mukta'dir was the twenty-first khalif of the dynasty of Abb\u00e1s. He succeeded his brother al-Raf\u00ed Billah to the throne of Baghdad in 941 A.D., 329 A.H., reigned 3 years 11 months and 15 days and died in 945 A.D., 333 A.H. He was succeeded by his nephew, al-Mustakfi the son of al-Mukta'dir.\n\nAl-Mutwakil, 'Al-Allah, This was the name and title assumed by Ab\u00fa Fas\u00edl Ja'far on his accession to the throne of Baghdad. He was the tenth khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, and the son of al-Mo'tasim Billah. He succeeded his brother al-W\u00e1thiq or W\u00e1siq in the year 847 A.D., 232 A.H., and began his reign with an act of the greatest cruelty. The late khalif's wasir having treated al-Mutwakil ill in his brother's lifetime, and opposed his election to the khalifate, was on that account now sent to prison, and afterwards thrown into an iron furnace lined with spikes or nails heated red hot, where he was miserably burnt to death. During this reign nothing remarkable happened, except wars with the Greeks, which were carried on with various success. He was very intolerant, especially of the Jews and Christians, on whom he heaped many indignities. He did not stop there. In his imbecility and ferocity he forbade the pilgrimage to Karbal\u00e1, and destroyed the sacred repository of the ashes of Hosain and the other martyrs interred there to be raised. He reigned 14 years 9 months and 9 days, and was assassinated and cut into seven pieces on the 24th December, 861 A.D., 17th Shawwal, 247 A.H., at the instance of his son al-Mustansar who succeeded him.\n\nAl-Muwaffik Billah, the son of al-Mutwakil Billah, the khalif of Baghdad and brother and coadjutor of the khalif al-Mo'tamid, to whom he was of much service in his battles against his enemies. He died of the elephantiasis or leprosy in the year 891 A.D., 278 A.H., and while in his last illness, could not help observing, that of 100,000 men whom he commanded, there was not one so miserable as himself. His son Mo'tasim, after the death of his brother al-Mo'tamid in 892 A.D., succeeded to the throne of Baghdad.\n\nAl-Muwyyid (Isma'il), whose name is spelt in Lempriere's Universal Biographical Dictionary, \"Alomvuddad\", and in Watkin's Biographical Dictionary \"Almuwaddad\", was an Arabian historian, who gave a chronological account of the Saracen affairs in Sicily from 842 to 904 A.D. This MS. is in the library of the Escorial, in Spain, and a Latin version of it is inserted in Muratoris' Rerum Italicae Scriptores.\n\nAl-Musani, see Ab\u00fa Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Isma'il.\n\nAl-Nasir Billah, or al-Nasir-uddin Allah, the son of al-Mustari succeeded his father to the throne of Baghdad in 1179 A.D. He professed the Sh\u00e1'\u00ed faith, and after a long reign of 46 lunar years and 11 months, died in the year 1225 A.D. He was the 34th khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, and was succeeded by his son al-T\u00e1hir Billah.\n\nAlp Arsalan, (which means in the Turkish language \"the valiant lion\") was a king of Persia of the Salj\u00fakian dynasty, and the son of D\u00e1d\u00ed Beg Salj\u00fak\u00ed. He succeeded his uncle Tughrul Beg in 1063 A.D., 455 A.H., married the sister of the khalif K\u00e1'im Billah, and his name, after that of the khalif, was pronounced in the public prayers of the Muhammadans. He was a warlike prince; and, having spoiled the Church of St. Basil in Cesarea, defeated Romanus Diogenes, emperor of the Greeks in 1068 A.D., 460 A.H., who was seized and carried to the conqueror. Alp Arsalan demanded of his captive, at the first conference, what he would have done if fortune had reversed their lot. \"I would have given thee many a stripe,\" was the imprudent and virulent answer. The Sultan only smiled and asked Romanus what he expected would be done to him. \"If thou art cruel,\" said the emperor, \"put me to death. If vain-glorious load me with chains, and drag me in triumph to thy capital. If generous, grant me my liberty.\" Alp Arsalan was neither cruel nor vain-glorious, he nobly released his prisoner, and gave all his officers who were captives dresses of honor, and sent them away. Alp Arsalan after a reign of more than nine years was stabbed about the 16th of December, 1079 A.D., 469 A.H., by a desperate Khw\u00e1rizmian, whom he had taken prisoner and sentenced to death. He was buried at Marv, in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and the following is the translation of the inscription engraved on his tomb: \"All ye who have seen the glory of Alp Arsalan exalted to the heavens come to Marv, and you will behold it buried in the dust.\" He was succeeded by his son Maliksh\u00e1h.\n\nAlp Arsalan, who is by some called Apal Arsalan, was the son of Atsz\u00e1, a Sult\u00e1n of Khw\u00e1rizm, whom he succeeded in A.D. 1166, 551\u2014567 A.H. and died in 1162 A.D.\n\nAlptakin or Alptagin, vide Alptakin.\n\nAl-Rashid or Harun al-Rashid, the celebrated hero of the Arabian Nights, was the fifth khalif of the race of Abb\u00e1s and son of al-Mahd\u00ed, he succeeded his eldest brother al-H\u00e1di to the throne of Baghdad in 786 A.D., 170 A.H. This was one of the best and wisest princes that ever sat on the throne of Baghdad. He was also extremely fortunate in all his undertakings, though he did not much extend his dominions by conquest. In his time the Moslem empire may be said to have been in its most flourishing state, though, by the independency of the Moslems in Spain, who had formerly set up a khalif of the house of Umyya, his territories were not quite so extensive as those of some of his predecessors. He, possessed the provinces of Syria, Palestine, Arabia, Persia, Armenia, Natolia, Media or Azurb\u00e9jan, Babylonia, Assyria, Sind, Sijistan, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, Tabrist\u00e1n, J\u00farj\u00e1n, Z\u00e1b\u00falist\u00e1n, Mawarrunnahr, or great Bukh\u00e1ria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania &c., so that his empire was by far the most powerful of any in the world, and extended farther than the Roman empire ever had done.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 802 A.D., 186 A.H., he divided the government of his extensive dominions among his three sons in the following manner: To al-Amin the eldest, he assigned the provinces of Syria, Ir\u00e1k, the three Arabian Mesopotamia, Assyria, Media, Palestine, Egypt, and all the part of Africa extending from the confines of Egypt and Ethiopia to the Straits of Gibraltar, with the dignity of khalif; to al-M\u00e1mid the second, he assigned Persia, Kirman, the Indies, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, Tabrist\u00e1n, Z\u00e1b\u00falist\u00e1n and Z\u00e1b\u00falist\u00e1n, together with the vast province of Mawarrunnahr, and to his third son al-K\u00e1sim, he gave Armenia, Natolia, J\u00farj\u00e1n, Georgia, Circassia, and all the Moslem territories bordering upon the Euxine sea. As to the order of succession, al-Amin was to ascend the throne immediately after his father's decease; after him, al-M\u00e1mid; and then al-K\u00e1sim, whom he had surmised al-Mo'tasim.\n\nThe most considerable exploits performed by this khalif were against the Greeks, who by their perfidy pro-\nvoked him to make war upon them, and whom he always overcame. In the year 803 A.D., 187 A.H., the khalif received a letter from the Greek emperor Nicephorus, commanding him to return all the money he had extorted from the Empress Irene, or expect soon to see an imperial army in the heart of his territories. This insolent letter so exasperated H\u00e1run, that he immediately assembled his forces and advanced to Heraclia, laying the country, through which he passed, waste with fire and sword. For some time also he kept that city straitly besieged; which so terrified the Greek emperor that he submitted to pay an annual tribute.\n\nIn the year 804 A.D., 188 A.H., war was renewed with the Greeks, and Nicephorus with a great army attacked the khalif's forces with the utmost fury. He was, however, defeated with the loss of 40,000 men, and received three wounds by the action; after which the Moellem committed terrible ravages in his territories, and returned home laden with spoil. The next year H\u00e1run invaded Phrygia, defeated an imperial army sent to oppose him, and having ravaged the country, returned without any considerable loss. In the year 806, 190 A.H., the khalif marched into the imperial territories with an army of 135,000 men, besides a great number of volunteers and others who were not enrolled among his troops. He first took the city of Heraclia, from which he is said to have carried 16,000 prisoners; after which he made himself master of several other places, and, in the conclusion of the expedition, he made a descent on the island of Cyprus, which he plundered in a terrible manner. This success so intimidated Nicephorus, that he immediately sent the tribute due to H\u00e1run, the withholding of which had been the cause of the war; and concluded a peace upon the khalif's own terms. Charlemagne respected his character, and H\u00e1run in token of his friendship presented to the European prince a clock, the mechanism and construction of which were regarded among the prodigies of the age. H\u00e1run reigned 23 years and died in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n on the eve of Saturday the 24th March, 809 A.D., 3rd Jamad II, 193 A.H., and was buried at T\u00faz which is now called Maashhad. He was succeeded by his eldest son al-Amin.\n\nAl-Rashid Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0644, the thirtieth khalif of the Abbasids succeeded his father al-Mustazhirshad in August or September, 1135 A.D., Zil'kad, 629 A.H., and died in the year 1136 A.D., 530 A.H. He was succeeded by al-Muktafi the son of al-Mustazhirshad.\n\nAl-Razi, see Razi.\n\nAl-Razi Billah, \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0642 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0644, the son of al-Muktafi and the twelfth khalif of the house of Abb\u00e1s, was the last who deserved the title of the Commander of the Faithful. He was raised to the throne of Baghdad, after the deposition of his uncle al-K\u00e1hir Billah by the wazir ibn M\u00e1kla in April 934 A.D., Jamad I, 322 A.H. In the year 936, the khalif finding himself distressed on all sides by usurpers, and having a wazir of no capacity, instituted a new office superior to that of wazir, which he entitled Amir-ul-Umra. This great officer, Im\u00e1d-ud-daula Ali B\u00f3ya, was trusted with the management of the finances in a much more absolute and unlimited manner than any of the khalif's wazirs ever had been. Nay he officiated for the khalif in the great mosque at Baghdad, and had his name mentioned in the public prayers throughout the kingdom. In short the khalif was so much under the power of this officer, that he could not apply a single dinar to his own use without the leave of the Amir-ul-Umra. In the year 937 A.D. the Moellem empire so great and powerful, was shared among the following usurpers:\n\nThe cities of Wasat, Baars, Kufa with the rest of the Arabian Iraq, were considered as the property of the Amir-ul-Umra, though they had been in the beginning of the year seized upon by a rebel called al-Baridi, who could not be driven out of them.\n\nThe country of Fara, Faristan, or Persia properly so called, was possessed by Imad-ud-daula Ali ibn Boysa, who resided in the city of Shir\u00e1z.\n\nPart of the tract denominated al-Jabal, together with Persian Ir\u00e1q, which is the mountainous part of Persia, and the country of the ancient Parthians, obeyed Rukn-ud-daula, the brother of Imad-ud-daula, who resided at Isfahan. The other part of the country was possessed by Wushmausin the Dilmite.\n\nDayr Rabia, Dayr Bikr, Dayr Modar, and the city of Mouaal, acknowledged for their sovereign a race of princes called Hamdanites.\n\nEgypt and Syria no longer obeyed the khalifa, but Muhammad ibn Tijj who had formerly been appointed governor of those provinces.\n\nAfrica and Spain had long been independent.\n\nCicily and Crete were governed by princes of their own.\n\nThe provinces of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n and M\u00e1varanunahr were under the dominions of al-Nasr ibn Ahmad, of the dynasty of the Sam\u00e1n\u00edes.\n\nThe provinces of Tabrist\u00e1n, Jurjan or Georgia, and M\u00e1var\u00e1nunahr, had kings of the first dynasty of the Dilamites.\n\nThe province of Kirman was occupied by Ab\u00fa Ali Muhammad ibn Eylia al-S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed, who had made himself master of it a short time before.\n\nLastly, the provinces of Yemen and Bahry, including the district of Hajar, were in the possession of Ab\u00fa T\u00e1hir the Karmanite.\n\nThus the khalifas were deprived of all their dominions, and reduced to the rank of sovereign pontiffs; in which light, though they continued for some time to be regarded by the neighbouring princes, yet their power never arrived to any height. In this low state the khalifas continued till the extinction of the Khilaf\u00e1t by Hal\u00e1ku Kh\u00e1n the Tartar in the year 1258 A.D., 666 A.H.\n\nAl-Razi Billah reigned 7 years 2 months and 11 days and died in 941 A.D., 329 A.H. He was succeeded by his brother al-Muttafi.\n\nAl-Saharawi, \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a, vide Ab\u00fal K\u00e1sim.\n\nAl-Saffah, \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0627\u062d, surname of Ab\u00fal Abb\u00e1s, the son of Muhammed, the son of \u00c1lf, the son of 'Abdull\u00e1h, the son of Abb\u00e1s the uncle of the prophet. He was proclaimed khalifa by the inhabitants of Kufa on Friday the 29th of November, 749 A.D., 13th Rah\u00ed II, 132 A.H., upon which a battle took place between him and Marw\u00e1n II the last khalifa, of the house of Umyya or Ommaides, in which the latter was slain, 5th of August, 750 A.D., 26th Zil-hijja, 132 A.H.\n\nAl-Saffah after this victory investing himself with sovereign power, laid the foundation of the dynasty of the Abb\u00e1sides, which continued to be transmitted to his family from father to son, for 524 lunar years, during a succession of 37 khalifas, till they were dispossessed by Hal\u00e1ku Kh\u00e1n the Tartar king of Persia in 1258 A.D., 666 A.H. By the elevation of the house of Abb\u00e1s to the dignity of khilaf\u00e1t, began that glorious period during which Arabic and Persian literature reached its highest perfection. With some few exceptions these khalifas were the noblest race of kings that ever adorned the throne of sovereignty.\n\nAb\u00fal Abb\u00e1s died, after a reign of more than four years, of the small-pox, on Sunday the 9th of June, 754 A.D., 13th Zil-hijja 136 A.H., and was succeeded by his brother Ab\u00fa Ja'far Almans\u00far.\n\nList of the khalifas of the race of Abb\u00e1s who reigned at Baghdad.\n\n1.

From this time to the reign of Aziz li-din Allah, during which period five khalifs ascended the throne of Egypt, the history of that country affords little else than an account of intestine broils and contests between the wazirs or prime ministers, who were now become so powerful, that they had in a great measure stripped the khalifs of their civil power, and left them nothing but a shadow of spiritual dignity. These contests at last gave occasion to a revolution, by which the race of Fatimite khalifs were totally extinguished.

He was naturally free of speech, and the emperor, fond of his repartee, had allowed him more license in conversation than was consistent with respect to his own dignity, when he was on business with the emperor, which by degrees disgusted Muhammad Shah and made him wish his removal from office. He was consequently, with the consent of the emperor, stabbed with a dagger by a person who had been discharged from his service, and fell down dead on the spot. This circumstance took place on Friday the 26th December, 1746, 23rd Zil-hijjah, 1159 H.

Treaty was ratified with him by the British Government on the 19th December, 1817. He had on various pretexts avoided the ratification of the engagements which his agent had concluded with the resident of Delhi, but the movement of troops in his vicinity, and their occupation of positions which left him only the option between immediate and unequal conflict and signing this treaty, induced him to adopt the safer course. He confirmed in the possession of all the territories he held from the Holkar family, but compelled to surrender his large trains of artillery to the English Government, and to disband that great body of plunderers which had been for more than two years the scourge of Malwa and Rajputana.

After his death his family through the intrigues of one Bakhsh Ali Khan, embraced the Muhammadan religion, and the younger daughter not long after was consigned to the Seraglio of king Nasiruddin Hydar and became one of the queens of that monarch, under the title of Wilayeti Mahal, or the King's European consort. The elder daughter also received the name and title of Ashraf-un-nisa Begam. She remained unmarried all her life. The brother Joseph Walters received the name of Amir Mirza. He was brought up as a Musalman of the Shi'a sect, and always took a pride in showing himself as an orthodox follower of the Crescent. After Wilayeti Mahal's death, her elder sister Ashraf-un-nisa Begam succeeded to her estate, consisting of Government Securities valued at 1,14,00,000 rupees besides jewellery, moveable and immoveable property of considerable value.

He is also called Timurlang (Tamerlane) from some defect in his feet; was born at Kush in ancient Sogdania on Tuesday the 9th April, 1336, A.D. 27th Sha'ban, 736 A.H. Some say he was the son of a shepherd, and others, that he was descended in a right line from Kajuli Bahadur, son of Tuman Khan, of the same lineage with Changer Khan the celebrated conqueror of Persia. His father's name was Amir Turghai and mother's Takina Khattun; however, his obscurity was soon forgotten in the glory of his exploits. Distinguished by his courage and unbounded ambition, he gained a number of faithful adherents, and seized the city of Balkh, the capital of Khurasan, and having put to death Amir Husain the ruler of that place, whose sister he had married, he ascended the throne on Wednesday the 10th of April, 1370 A.D., 12th Ramzan, 771 A.H. He then subdued Kandahar, Persia, and Bagdad, and seconded by an enthusiastic army, he penetrated to India, took Delhi on Tuesday the 17th December, 1398 A.D., 7th Rab'i II, 801 A.H., with its immense treasures, and returned to punish Bagdad that shook off his yoke. The offending city was given up to pillage, and 80,000 of her inhabitants put to the sword. Now master of the fairer part of Asia, he interfered, at the request of the Greek emperor, in the affairs of Bajazid (Bajazet) emperor of the Turks, and commanded him to abandon the siege of Constantinople. The message roused the indignation of Bajazid; he marched against the new enemy, and was defeated by him in Phrygia, after a battle of 3 days on Friday the 21st of July, 1402 A.D., 19th Zil-hijjah, 804 A.H. Bajazid fell into the hands of the conqueror, and was carried about in mockery in an iron cage. To these conquests Taimur added Egypt and the treasures of Cairo, and then fixed the seat of his empire at Samarkand, where he received the homage of Manuel Palaeologus, emperor of Constantinople, and of Henry III, King of Castile, by their ambassadors. Taimur was preparing fresh victories by the invasion of China, when death stopped his career on Wednesday the 18th of February, 1406 A.D., 17th Sha'ban, 807 A.H., in the 38th year of his reign, aged 71 years, and was buried at Samarkand. He was the first who founded the dynasty of the Mughul emperors of Delhi. After his death he received the title of \"Firdaus Makani,\" i.e., \"May paradise be his place of residence.\" He had four sons, viz., Jahangir Mirza, Umar Shaikh Mirza, Miran Shah and Shahrukh Mirza. Tamerlane on his deathbed named his grandson Pir Muhammad son of Jahangir Mirza, the universal heir of all his dominions; but the contempt with which his will was treated after his death, was equal to the veneration which had been paid to his authority during his life. The Sultan Khalfi, another of his grandsons, immediately took possession of the capital of Samarkand, and proclaimed himself emperor. Pir Muhammad did not live long enough to assert his rights, but was assassinated six months after the death of\nAmir\n\nhis grandfather.

Afterwards Umar the khal\u00edf sent him into Egypt, which he reduced in 641 A.D., 20 A.H., and became lieutenant of the conquered country. Usma\u00edn continued him in that post four years, and then removed him; whereupon he retired to Palestine, where he lived privately till Usma\u00edn's death. Upon this event, he went over to Mu'aw\u00eda upon his invitation; and took a great part in the dispute between 'Ali and Mu'aw\u00eda. The latter restored him to the lieutenancy of Egypt, and continued him in it till his death, which happened in 663 A.D., 48 A.H. Before he turned Mu\u1e25ammadan, he was one of the three poets who were famous for writing lampoons upon Mu\u1e25ammad, in which style of composition 'Amr\u00fa particularly excelled. There are some fine proverbs of his remaining, and also some good verses. He was the son of a courtezan of Mecca, who seems to have numbered some of the noblest of the land among her lovers.

He was at last seized by Amir Ima'd S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed in 900 A.D., 288 A.H., and sent to Baghd\u00e1d where he was confined for some time; his execution was the last act of the Khal\u00edf Al-Mo'tas\u00edd, who gave orders for it a few months before his own death in 901 A.D., 289 A.H. He was blind of one eye. With Amr\u00fa fell the fortunes of his family. His grandson T\u00e1hir, struggled for power in his native province: but after a reign of six years, during which he conquered F\u00e1rs, his authority was subverted by one of his own officers, by whom he was seized and sent prisoner to Baghd\u00e1d.

Whilst the two princes were engaged in\nwar, the two poets assailed one another by rhymes sent\non the point of arrows. He is also said to have been the\ngreatest astronomer of his age.

He was consequently seized in the beginning of the year 1818, and brought to the Residency, where he continued in confinement till directed to be sent under a strong escort to the Company's territories. When arrived at Raichora, a village within one march from Jalapul, he contrived by bribing some of his guards, to make his escape. It is believed that, after having for a short period found a refuge in Asfiygarh, he fled to the Panjab where he remained a miserable dependant on the charity of R\u00e1ja Ranjit Singh. After the dethronement of 'Ap\u00e1 Sahib, the grandson of R\u00e1gh\u00f3j\u00ed Bhonsla was raised to the masnad of N\u00e1gpur.

Ar\u00e1fr\u00fa, emboldened by the Naw\u00e1b's retreat, attacked and slew the deputy; upon which the wazir Kamar-udd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n applied for assistance to Burh\u00e1n-ul-Mulk Sa'\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n S\u00fabd\u00e1r of Oudh, for the reduction of the rebel.

He was the first king of the S\u00e1s\u00e1nian dynasty. His father B\u00e1b\u00e1k, who was an inferior officer in the public service, after putting to death the governor appointed by Ard\u00e1w\u00e1n (Artabanus) made himself master of the province Fars. The old man survived but a short time. His son Ardisher, after settling the affairs of Fars, not only made himself master of Isfahan, but of almost all Ir\u00e1k before Ard\u00e1w\u00e1n, who was the reigning prince, took the field against him, about the year 223 A.D. The armies met in the plains of Hurmus, where a desperate battle ensued, in which Ard\u00e1w\u00e1n lost his crown and his life; and the son of B\u00e1b\u00e1k was hailed in the field with the proud title of Sh\u00e1han Sh\u00e1h, or King of kings. He was contemporary with Alexander Severus the Roman emperor. Ardisher (whom the Roman historians call Artaxerxes) having reigned 14 years as absolute sovereign of Persia, resigned the government into the hands of his son, Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, called by the Romans, Sapor or Sapores, in the year 238 A.D.\n\nThe following is a list of the kings of Persia of the S\u00e1s\u00e1nian race.\n\n1.

Yezdijard III.\nArdisher, (or Artaxerxes) II succeeded his father Sh\u0101hpur II in the year 380 A.D., and sat on the throne of Persia only four years, during which period no event of consequence occurred. He was deposed in 384 A.D., by his brother Sh\u0101hpur III, who succeeded him.\n\nArdisher, (or Artaxerxes) III, a king of Persia, of the Sasanian race, who reigned about the year 629 A.D., at Sherv\u0101n.\n\nArdisher Darazdast, an ancient king of Persia, the Artaxerxes Longimanus of the Greeks, surnamed Bahman, was the son of Isfandiar. He succeeded his grandfather, Gashasp, as king of Persia in 464 B.C. He is celebrated for the wisdom he displayed in the internal regulation of his empire. In the commencement of the reign of this monarch, the celebrated Rustam was slain by the treachery of his brother. This prince is named Ahasuerus in Scripture, and is the same who married Esther, and during the whole of his reign shewed the greatest kindness to the Jewish nation. The long reign of this monarch includes that of two or more of his immediate successors, who are not noticed by Persian writers. According to them, he ruled Persia 112 years, and was succeeded by his daughter Queen Hum\u0101i.\n\nArghun Khan, the son of Ab\u0101k\u0101 Kh\u0101n and grandson of Hal\u0101k\u016b Kh\u0101n, was raised to the throne of Persia after the murder of his uncle Ahmad Kh\u0101n, surnamed Nek\u014dd\u0101r, in August, 1284 A.D., Jam\u0101d I, 683 A.H. His reign was marked by few events of consequence. He recalled the celebrated Shams-ud-din Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h D\u012bw\u0101n his father's wazir, who, disgusted with court, had retired to Isfah\u0101n; but this able minister was hardly re-established in his office, before his enemies persuaded the prince that he had actually poisoned his father; and the aged wazir was in the same year made over to the public executioner. Amir B\u016bk\u0101, the rival of Shams-ud-din, rose, upon his fall, to such power that he was tempted to make a grasp at the crown; but he was unsuccessful, and lost his life in the attempt. Arghun Kh\u0101n died on Saturday the 10th of March, 1291 A.D., 5th Rabi' I, 690 A.H., after a reign of 6 years and 9 months, and was succeeded by his brother Kajap\u016bt or Kaikha\u1e6d\u016b.\n\nArghun Shah Jani Kurbani, (Am\u012br) who reigned in Na\u1e63\u012bn\u0101pur and T\u016bs about the year 1337 A.D., and was defeated by the Sarbadals of Sabzw\u0101r.\n\n'Arif, the poetical name of the son of Ghul\u0101m Husain Kh\u0101n.

It was completed in 1645 A.D., 1055 A.H., and is now called the \"T\u0101j,\" or \"T\u0101j Mah\u0101l,\" which is said to have cost the enormous sum of \u00a3750,000.

But this did not much mend the matter, the government of the new king of theirs, being even more inauspicious than that of the queen; for in her reign the confines of the empire were only invaded, but in his, all was entirely lost, and the whole kingdom and country of the Persians fell into the hands of the Musalm\u0101ns.

The hill had long before been encircled by a wall to protect the cattle, and it was to employ the poor that As\u00e1 constructed instead of the fortifications which still remain beyond all comparison, the strongest native built fortress in India. As\u00e1 was put to death by Malik Nasir, the Muhammadan chief of Khandais, who possessed himself of the stronghold by treachery, and completed the fortifications.

His ancestors were of Samarqand, but he was born at Agra; but was brought up and lived at Delhi where he rose to great fame as a poet and writer of the Persian language, whilst his compositions in Urdu were not less admired. He won the favour of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, the last king of Delhi, who conferred upon him the title of Naw\u00e1b and appointed him royal preceptor in the art of poetry.

His best work is supposed to be lost. He was the master of Firdaus\u00ed, who afterwards composed the Sh\u00e1h N\u00e1ma. It is said that Firdaus\u00ed on his departure from Gharn\u00ed requested him to finish the Sh\u00e1h N\u00e1ma which was yet incomplete, and that As\u00e1di composed that part of the poem between the Arabian conquest of eastern Persia under the khalif 'Umar, to the end, consisting of 4,000 couplets. The year of As\u00e1di's death is unknown, but it appears from the above circumstance, that he was living in 1010 A.D., 401 A.H., in which year Firdaus\u00ed departed from Ghaz\u00edm. The most celebrated of the other works of As\u00e1di now extant, is his dispute between Day and Night, a translation of which in English verse is to be found in the \"Rose Garden of Persia,\" by Louisa Stuart Costello, published, London, 1846.\n\n**Asad Khan**, \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0633\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646, (Naw\u00e1b) entitled As\u00e1f-ud-daula and Jumlat-ul-Mulk, was descended from an illustrious family of Turkomans.

In the reign of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h he was appointed Wak\u00edl Mukh\u00e1 (an office superior to waz\u00edr), and his son Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm made M\u00edr Bakhshi or chief paymaster with the title of Farrukh\u00edsa\u00ed, but on the accession of Farrukh\u00edsa\u00ed, he was disgraced, his estates seized, and his son put to death. Since that period, he lived upon a scanty pension in a sort of confinement, but much respected by all ranks.

Asafi is his poetical name, which he took on account of his father having served in the capacity of waz\u00edr to Sult\u00e1n Ab\u00fa Sa'id Mirz\u00e1; for, they say, that Asaf or Asaph of the Scriptures, was waz\u00edr to king Solomon.

From the time of the decline of the dynasty of Saljuk to the conquest of Persia by Halak Kh\u00e1n (which occupies a period of more than a century,) that country was distracted by the contests of a number of petty princes, or governors, called Atabaks; who taking advantage of the weakness of the last monarchs of the race of Saljuk, established their authority over some of the finest provinces of the empire. One of the most distinguished of these Atabaks was Eldiguz, a Turkish slave, whose descendants reigned over Azurbejan. The Atabaks of Fars were descended from Salghur, a Turkish general. Eldiguz and Salghur, also Imad-ud-din Zanghi. There were four dynasties of these Atabaks.\n\nAtabak Abu Bakr, the son of Atabak Muhammad, the son of Eldiguz, succeeded his uncle Kizal Arsalan as prime minister to Tughral III Saljuki in 1191 A.D., 587 A.H. He appears to have contented himself with the principality of Azurbejan, and fixed his residence at Tabriz. His long reign was only disturbed by one war with his brother Kutluk, in which he was victorious. Kutluk fled into Khwarizm and encouraged Ahmad bin-Taksh to advance against Tughral III whom he defeated and slew in 1194 A.D., 590 A.H. Abu Bakr died in 1210 A.D., 607 A.H., and was succeeded by his brother Atabak Musaffar.\n\nAtabak Abu Bakr bin-Sa'd bin-Zangi, the son of Atabak Sa'd, one of the Atabaks of Isfahan of the race of the Dilamites. He died in 1227 A.D., 624 A.H., aged 84 years.\n\nAtabak Eldiguz, also Atabak Musaffar, was the eldest son of Eldiguz, whom he succeeded as prime minister in 1179 A.D., 568 A.H. When Tughral III, a prince of the Saljukian dynasty (who was a child of seven years of age) was placed on the throne in 1176 A.D., Muhammad, who was his uncle, became the actual ruler of Persia. This chief after enjoying power 13 years died in March, 1186 A.D., 571 Hijra, 581 A.H., in which year the conjunction of all the planets took place. He was succeeded by his brother, Kizal Arsalan.\n\nAtabak Musaffar, the son of Atabak Muhammad. He succeeded his brother Abu Bakr in 1210 A.D., 607 A.H., and not only inherited Azurbejan, but a considerable part of Irak. He enjoyed this power 15 years, after which Azurbejan was invaded and conquered by Sultan Jalal-ud-din the monarch of Khwarizm A.D. 1226, 622 A.H. Musaffar shut himself up in the fort of Alanjat, where he died; and with him perished the power of the family of Eldiguz.\n\nAtabak Musaffar-ud-din Zangi, a prince of Shiraz, and brother of Sunkar, which see.\n\nAtabak Sa'd bin-Zangi, also Sunkar.\n\n'Ata Husain Khan, whose poetical name was Tahsin, is the author of the \"Nautara Murasa,\" an Urdu translation of the \"Chahar Darweeh.\" He flourished in the time of Nawab Amf-ud-daula of Lucknow, about the year 1776 A.D., 1189 A.H. As a specimen of the Urdu language the Nautara Murasa was rendered objectionable for students, by his retaining too much of the phonology and idiom of the Persian and Arabic. On this account a simple version was executed by Mir Amman of Delhi in 1801 A.D., 1217 A.H., which is styled the \"Bagh-o-Bahar;\" vide Tahsin.\n\nAtal, also Atal-ud-din, a name assumed by Mir Abdul Jalil of Delhi in his poetical compositions, who gave out that he was by inspiration the pupil of Ja'far Zatalli, and wrote poetry in Persian and Arabic.\n\n'Ata Malik, also Ata-ud-din surnamed 'Ata Malik.\n\nAtash, also Atash, poetical name of Khwaja Haidar Ali of Luckhan, who is the author of two Divans or books of Odes consisting of Persian and Urdu verses.

This book was written at Hirat and dedicated to Amir Ali Shah in 1494 A.D., 899 A.H. He is also called Amir Jamal-ud-din Ata-ullah. He also wrote another work on the art of writing poetry, entitled \"Kitab Takmil-us-Sanati\" dedicated to the same Amir in which he calls himself 'Ata-ullah bin-Muhammad-al-Husaini Naishapuri. He was wazir to Sultan Husain Mirza of Hirat, and died in the beginning of the year 917 A.H.\n\nAt-har or Athar Khan, also At-har Khan, the son of Amir Nizam-ud-din Rasuli; he was a native of Bukhara, and came to India in the time of the emperor Alamgir, where he collected his poems into a Divan.\n\nAshir-ud-din, pronounced by the Indians Ashir-ud-din, which see.\n\nAtma, poet whose proper name is Abul Is-hak Hallaj, which see.\n\nAtais, also Atais, one of the Sultans of Khwarizm called Atais ibn-Auk by Ibn Khallikan.

From the name of this prince we have made John the Priest, who was stripped of his dominions by Changoz Khan in 1202 A.D., 599 A.H. They have since applied the name of John the Priest or Prestre John, to the king of Ethiopia, because he was a Christian. Avant Khan is by some authors called Avant Khan. He was a very powerful sovereign, and the greatest part of Tartary was tributary to him; but he was defeated and put to death by Changeiz Khan.\n\nAven Rosch, vide Ibn Rashid.\nAvensur, vide Abdul Malik bin-Zohr.\nAverroes, vide Ibn Rashid.\nAvicenna, vide Abu Sina.\n\nAweis Karani, \u0627\u0648\u0633 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc (Khwaja) an upright Muslim of the Sufi sect, who had given up the world, used to say to those that sought him, \"Do you seek God? If you do, why do you come to me? And if you do not seek God, what business can I have with you?\" He was an inhabitant of Yemen and of the tribe of K\u00e1ran. He was slain in a battle fought by Ali against Mu'awiya I. in 657 A.D., 17th Shawwal, 37 A.H. This man had never seen Muhammad, and yet the Musalmans say, that when he heard that Muhammad had lost a tooth in battle, and not knowing which, he broke all his teeth.\n\nAweis Jalayer, \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0633 \u062c\u0644\u0627\u06cc\u0631 (Sult\u00e1n) succeeded his father Amir Hasan Buzurg as king of Baghdad in July 1356, A.D., Rajab 757 A.H., and after a reign of nearly nineteen lunar years died on Tuesday the 10th October, 1374 A.D., 2nd Jamad I, 776 A.H.

He was murdered by Sultan Abu Said Mirza between the years 1461 and 1467 A.D.\n\n'Ayani, \u0639\u0627\u06cc\u0646\u06cc, whose proper name was Abu Is-hak Ibrahim, probably flourished previous to the 8th century of the Hijrat. He is the author of a Masnavi called \"Anbia Nama,\" a history of the prophets who preceded Muhammad.\n\nAyaz, \u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0632, a slave of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, who being a great favourite of his master, was envied by the courtiers; they therefore informed the Sultan that they frequently observed Ayaz go privately into the Jewel office; whence they presumed he had purloined many valuable effects. The next time when the slave had entered the treasury, the Sultan followed by a private door, and unobserved, saw Ayaz draw from a large chest a suit of old dirty garments with which having clothed himself, he prostrated himself on the ground and returned thanks to the Almighty for all the benefits conferred on him. The Sultan, being astonished, went to him, and demanded an explanation of his conduct. He replied, \"Most gracious Sire, when I first became your Majesty's servant, this was my dress, and till that period, humble had been my lot. Now that, by the grace of God and your majesty's favor, I am elevated above all the nobles of the land, and am intrusted with the treasures of the world, I am fearful that my heart should be puffed up with vanity; I therefore daily practice this humiliation to remind me of my former insignificance.\" The Sultan being much pleased, added to his rank, and severely reprimanded his slanderers.\n\n'Ayaz (Kazi), \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0639\u0627\u06cc\u0632, son of Musa, and author of the \"Sharah Sahih Muslim,\" Masharik-ul-Anwar, and several other works.

She was his third wife, and the only one that was a maid, being then only of seven years of age. On which account (some say) her father, whose original name was Abd-ullah, was named Abu Bakr, that is to say, the father of the virgin. An Arabian author, cited by Maracci, says, that Abu Bakr was very averse to the giving him his daughter so young, but that Muhammad pretended a divine command for it; whereupon he sent her to him with a basket of dates, and when the girl was alone with him, he stretched out his hand, and rudely took hold of her clothes; upon which she looked fiercely at him, and said, \"People call you the faithful man, but your behaviour to me shews you are a pernicious one.\" But this story is most probably one of those calumnies against Muhammad, which were invented and found favour during the Middle Ages. After the death of her husband, she opposed the succession of Ali, and had several bloody battles with him; although violent, her character was respected, and when taken prisoner by Ali, she was dismissed without injury. She was called prophetess and mother of the faithful. She died aged 67 in the year 678 A.D., 58 A.H. Her brother Abdur Rahman, one of the four who stood out against Yazid's inauguration, died the same year. There is a tradition that 'Ayeshah was murdered by the direction of Mu'awiya I, and the following particulars are recorded. 'Ayeshah having resolutely and insultingly refused to engage her allegiance to Yazid, Mu'awiya invited her to an entertainment, where he had prepared a very deep well or pit in that part of the chamber reserved for her reception, and had the mouth of it deceptively covered over with leaves and straw. A chair was then placed upon the fatal spot, and 'Ayeshah, on being conducted to her seat, instantly sank into eternal night, and the mouth of the pit was immediately covered with stones and mortar. There is, however, no trustworthy authority in support of this story.\n\n'Ayn-uddin (Shaikh), \u0634\u06cc\u062e \u0639\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646, of Bijapur, author of the \"Mulhikat,\" and Kitab-ul-Anwar containing a history of all the Muhammedan saints of India.

The sovereigns of Damascus eagerly embraced the opportunity of obtaining a footing in Egypt, and in 1163 A.D., 558 A.H., despatched a force under As\u00e1d-ud-d\u00edn Sh\u00ednkoh (the brother of Aiy\u00fab) and his nephew Sal\u00e1h-udd\u00edn to reinstate Sh\u00e1war; whose rival called in the Christians of Palestino to his support; but ere Amauri (the brother and successor of Baldwin III) could\nenter Egypt, Dargam had been overpowered and slain by Shirakoh, who replaced Sh\u00e1war in his former power. But Sh\u00e1war, faithless alike to friend and foe, now entered into arrangements with the Franks in order to elude the fulfilment of his engagements with N\u00far-uddin; and Shirakoh, after maintaining himself for some time in Belbes against the joint forces of Jerusalem and Egypt, was compelled to enter into a convention with Amauri and evacuate the country. But he was soon recalled by Sh\u00e1war to deliver him from the vengeance of his new allies to whom he had proved as perfidious as to those of his own faith; Cairo was closely besieged by the Franks, and the Fatimite khalif 'Azid le-din Allah sent the hair of his women, the extreme symbol of Oriental distress, to implore the succour of N\u00far-uddin (1163 A.D.). Shirakoh again entered Egypt with an army, forced Amauri to retreat, and after beheading the double traitor Sh\u00e1war, installed himself in the twofold office of wazir to the Fatimite khalif, and lieutenant of Egypt in the name of N\u00far-uddin; but dying the same year, was succeeded in his dignities by his famous nephew S\u00e1l\u00e1n-uddin, who after the death of N\u00far-uddin in May, 1173 A.D., Sh\u00e1war, 969 A.H., became the sole master of Egypt and Syria. The khalif 'Azid died in 1171 A.D., 967 A.H., and the name of the Abbaside khalif Musta'iz was substituted in the public prayers till the death of N\u00far-uddin.\n\n'Azim, \u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645, poetical name of Sirj\u00fad-daula Muhammad Ghaus Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of the Karn\u00e1t.\n\n'Azim, \u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645, poetical name of Sayyad 'Azim 'Al\u00ed of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, author of a Diw\u00e1n in Urdu, composed in 1855 A.D.\n\n'Azim Ali (Mir), \u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0631, of Agra, author of a Sikandar N\u00e1ma in Urdu verse, translated from the one in Persian, in 1844 A.D.\n\n'Azim Humayun, \u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0646, vide Adil Kh\u00e1n F\u00e1r\u00fak\u00ed II.\n\n'Azim Humayun Shirwani, \u0627\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0646 \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06cc, a nobleman of the court of Sultan Sikandar Shah Lodi.

He was a native of Ghazi, and formerly served under Prince K\u00e1mr\u00e1n Mirz\u00e1. It is said that he saved the life of Humay\u00fan, or had been of some service to him after his defeat by Sher Shah at Kanauj; for which service he was handsomely rewarded by that emperor after his having recovered the kingdom. He accompanied the emperor to Persia, and as his wife Jij\u00ed Begum became the wet-nurse of Akbar, the emperor's son, he was consequently called Anka Kh\u00e1n. He was the first person that was honored with the rank of \"Firdaus-i-H\u00e1fi\", or Seven Thousand, by Akbar. The office of W\u00e1z\u00edr Mutlaq, which was taken away from M\u00edh\u00e1mm Anka, was also conferred on him; on which account, Adham Kh\u00e1n Kokalt\u00e1sh, the son of M\u00edh\u00e1mm Anka, took offence, and assassinated Kh\u00e1n 'Azim on Monday, the 18th of May, 1562 A.D., 12th R\u00e1zm\u00e1n, 969 A.H., in a room adjoining to that occupied by the emperor. Adham Kh\u00e1n was immediately bound hand and foot, by order of the emperor, and thrown down headlong from a window of the court at Agra, where this circumstance had taken place, and crushed to death. The remains of Kh\u00e1n 'Azim were sent to Delhi, and buried in the vicinity of the Dargah of Niz\u00e1m-udd\u00edn Anl\u00e1, where a mausoleum was erected over his grave by his son Mirz\u00e1 Aziz K\u00f3ka which is still to be seen at Delhi.

He was called K\u00f3ka or Kokalt\u00e1sh on account of his being foster-brother and playmate of Akbar; for his mother whose name was Jij\u00ed Begum, was Akbar's wet-nurse. He was one of the best generals of the emperor, who, in the 10th year of his reign conferred on him the title of 'Azim Kh\u00e1n. He held the government of Gujrat for seven years together, and being absent from the presence for a long period, was summoned to court by Akbar in 1592, 999 A.H., but as that chief had always entertained the wish to proceed on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and his friends representing to him that the king was displeased with him, and merely sought an opportunity to imprison him, he placed his family and treasure on board a vessel, and on the 13th of March, 1594 O.S., 1st Rajab, 1002 A.H., set sail for Hoj\u00e1z without leave or notice. In a short time, however, he found his situation irksome in that country, and returned to India, where he made his submission, and was restored at once to his former place in the emperor's favor and confidence. He died at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d Gujrat in the 19th year of the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr 1624 A.D., 1033 A.H.

He gained a great number of proselytes in 'Azarbaijan and Persian Irak, where he soon grew powerful enough to wage war with the khalif Al-Atamun, whose troops he often beat, so that he was become extremely formidable in the beginning of the khalifa Al-Mutasim's reign. The general sent by the khalif to reduce him, was Haidar-ibn-Kaus, surnamed Ashin, a Turk by birth. By him Babak was defeated with prodigious slaughter, no fewer than 60,000 men being killed in the first engagement. The next year 835 A.D., 220 A.H., he received a still greater overthrow, losing 100,000 men either killed or taken prisoners. By this defeat he was obliged to retire into the Gordian mountains, where he fortified himself in such a manner, that Ashin found it impossible to reduce him till the year 837 A.D., 222 A.H., when he was forced to surrender to Ashin, upon that general's promising him pardon. But Ashin no sooner had him in his power, than he first caused his hands and feet, and afterwards his head to be cut off.

The following is a translation of a few lines:\n\nSince not for me thy cheek of roses shines,\nMy bosom like the fading tulip pines;\nWho in his burning heart conceals its flame,\nAnd mine, in absence, perishes the same.\nPour wine\u2014and let me as I drink suppose.\nI see the colours of that blushing rose;\nPour wine\u2014and let it borrow every hue\nBorn in the tulip's petals wet with dew;\nTill I believe thou mayst o'er yet be mine\u2014\nAnd let me never wake, nor that sweet dream resign.\n\nBadr, \u0628\u062f\u0631, poetical title of Gang\u00e1 Par\u00e1h\u00e1d, a Hind\u00fa.\n\nBadr Chachi, \u0628\u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0686\u06cc, surnamed Fakhr-us-zam\u00e1n, a celebrated poet of Ch\u00e1ch (the ancient name of T\u00edshkhand) who flourished in the reign of Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Tughl\u00e1k Sh\u00e1h, king of Dehli, and died some time after the year 1344 A.D., 745 A.H.\n\nBadr Muhammad, \u0628\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u062f\u0647\u0644\u06cc, of Dehli, author of the Persian Dictionary called \"Ad\u00e1b-ul-Fuzal\u00e1,\" dedicated to Kadr Kh\u00e1n bin Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, written in 1419 A.D., 822 A.H.\n\nBadr Shiwani (Maulana), \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u062f\u0631 \u0634\u06cc\u0648\u0627, a Musulm\u00e1n scholar and poet who was contemporary with Kit\u00edb\u00ed who died in 1482 A.D.\n\nBadr (Fir), vide Fir Badar.\n\nBadr-uddin Aintabi, \u0628\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062a\u0627\u0628\u06cc, an historian who relates that the K\u00e1z\u00ed Ibn-al-Maghd\u00ed who died in 1231 A.D., 628 A.H., bequeathed a part of his vast collection of books to the library of the college founded in Cairo by M\u00e1lik 'Ashraf Borsab\u00e1.\n\nBadr-uddin (Balbaki), \u0628\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0628\u0644\u0628\u06a9\u06cc, a Syrao physician, who wrote a book called \"Musarr\u00e1h-al-N\u00e1s.\" He lived in the 7th century of the Hijrah.\nBadr-uddin, Isma'il-al-Tabrizi, an Arabian author, surnamed B\u00e2sil.\n\nBadr-uddin Jajurmi, an author who died in 1287 A.D., 686 A.H., in which year also died Majd-uddin Haimkar.

Her father refusing to give her in marriage to that prince, because she had been betrothed to Shaika Hasan Jal\u00e2li, was the occasion of the Amir's disgrace and death. Hasan who had married her, afterwards repudiated her, and gave her into the hands of Abu Sa'id. The prince publicly married her, and for some time was entirely governed by her; but being at last disturbed, and dying a short time after in 1335 A.D., 736 A.H., she was suspected to have poisoned him, and B\u00e2sid Kh\u00e2n, the successor of Abu Sa'id, put her to death.\n\nBadr-un-nisa Begam, the daughter of Alamgir died in March 1670 A.D., Zi-Ka'da 1080 A.H.\n\nBadshah Begam, wife of the emperor Jahangir, died in the year 1029 A.H.\n\nBaghuri, or Baghahuri, surname of Muhammad bin Is-h\u00e2k, an Arabian author who wrote on moral subjects, died in the year 1280 A.D., 679 A.H.\n\nBaghwi, vide Ab\u00fb Muhammad Far\u00e2'i-ibn-Mas'ud al-Baghwi.\n\nBahadur Ali Husaini (Mir), chief Munshi of the college of Fort William, author of the Akhl\u00e2k Hindi, or Indian Ethics, translated from a Persian version, also of the \"Nasir Benazir,\" a prose translation of the enchanting Fairy Tale entitled \"Sehrul-Bayan\" commonly called \"Mir Hasan's Masnavi.\" This latter work was written by the request of Dr. Gilchrist in 1802 A.D., 1217 A.H., and published at Calcutta in 1803.\n\nBahadur Khan Faruki, succeeded his father Raj\u00e2 Alt Kh\u00e2n in the government of Kh\u00e2ndesh in 1596 A.D., 1005 A.H. When the emperor Akbar a few years afterwards arrived at Mandu, with the avowed intention of invading the Dakh\u00e2n, Bahadur Kh\u00e2n instead of adopting the policy of his father in relying on the house of Akbar, and acting with an army to co-operate with him, shut himself up in the fort of Asir, commenced preparations to withstand a siege. When Akbar heard of these proceedings, he sent orders to the Kh\u00e2nkh\u00e2n\u00e2 Abdur Rahim Kh\u00e2n, and the prince Danial Mirz\u00e2 to continue the siege of Ahmadnagar, while he himself marched to the south and occupied Burhanpur, leaving one of his generals to besiege Asir. The blockade of this fortress continued for a length of time, till it surrendered, and Bahadur Kh\u00e2n, the last of the Faruki dynasty humbled himself before the throne of Akbar in the year 1599 A.D., 1008 A.H., while the impregnable fortress of Asir with ten years' provisions and countless treasures fell into the hands of the conqueror.\n\nBahadur Khan Rohila, son of Dari\u00e2 Kh\u00e2n, was an amir of high rank in the reign of the emperor Shah Jah\u00e2n. He accompanied prince Aurangzib to Kandah\u00e2r, and died there during the siege, on the 19th of July 1649 A.D., 19th Rajab, 1059 A.H.\n\nBahadur Nizam Shah, the last of the Niz\u00e2m Sh\u00e2hi kings of Ahmadnagar in the Dakh\u00e2n. On the death of his father Ibr\u00e2him Niz\u00e2m Sh\u00e2h, which took place in August 1595 A.D., Zil-hijja 1003 A.H., several factions arose in Ahmadnagar, each setting up a nominal sovereign. Mi\u00e2n Manj\u00fb, who possessed the city, and acknowledged the title of Bahadur Niz\u00e2m Sh\u00e2h, then an infant, being besieged by his competitors, invited Sultan Mur\u00e2d, son of the emperor Akbar, then governor of Gujrat, to his assistance, for which he offered to become tributary to the Mughal power. Sultan Mur\u00e2d embraced the proposal, and arrived before Ahmadnagar with a considerable army. Mi\u00e2n Manj\u00fb by this time, having overcome his rivals, repented of his offers, and prepared to oppose the prince. Having committed the city to the charge of Nas\u00eer Kh\u00e2n his deputy, and the care of Chand Bib\u00ee, great aunt to Sultan Bahadur, he departed to raise levies, and implore the assistance of Kutb Sh\u00e2h of Golkanda and Adil Sh\u00e2h of Bijapur. Sultan Mur\u00e2d besieged Ahmadnagar, on the 16th of December 1595 O.S., 23rd Rajab A.H., which was gallantly defended. Breaches were made, but were immediately repaired by the heroic conduct of Chand Bib\u00ee, who covered herself with a veil, headed the troops. At length, in the month of March 1596, Rajab, 1004 A.H., supplies growing scarce in the camp, and the allies of Bijapur and Golkanda approaching, Sultan Mur\u00e2d thought proper to accept of some offers of tribute from Chand Bib\u00ee, and raise the siege. Some money was paid, and the districts in Berar belonging to the Niz\u00e2m Sh\u00e2hi government were ceded to the Mughals. In the year 1600 A.D., beginning of 1009 A.H., Ahmadnagar was taken by the Mughals, and Bahadur Shah with all the children of both sexes of the royal family were taken prisoners and sent to perpetual confinement in the fortress of Gwalior.\n\nBahadur Singh Kuchwaha, brother to Sakat Singh, died of hard-drinking in the year 1621 A.D., 1030 A.H.\n\nBahadur Shah, an Afghan, succeeded his father Mahm\u00fbd Kh\u00e2n as governor of Bengal in the\nBahadur Shah, the second son of Muzaffar Shah II, of Gujrat. At the time of his father's death, he was absent at Jaunpur, but when Mahmud Shah his younger brother ascended the throne of Gujrat, after the murder of his eldest brother Sikandar Shah, Bahadur returned from thence, and having deprived Mahmud of his kingdom, ascended the throne on the 20th of August 1526, A.D., 15th Zil-Ka'da 932 A.H. He conquered Malwa on the 26th February 1531, 9th Shaban, 937 A.H., and the king of that place, Sultan Mahmud II, who was taken prisoner and sent to Champanir, was put to death on the road. In the year 1536 A.D., 942 A.H. Malwa was taken by the emperor Humayun, and Bahadur being defeated was obliged to fly towards Cambay, where, on his arrival, he heard that a fleet, in which there were between 4 or 5,000 Europeans, had arrived off the island of Diu. He immediately repaired to Cambay for a reinforcement of troops, and on his arrival there, he ordered his barge and went to visit the fleet, with the intention of killing him; but perceiving that he was betrayed, he arose, and was attacked on all sides by the Portuguese, when a soldier struck him over the head with a sword and threw him into the water, where he was drowned. This event took place on the 14th of February 1537, 3rd Ramazan, 943 A.H., and has been commemorated in two Persian chronograms, comprising the numerals which form the date of the year when it occurred. Their meaning is this: \"The Europeans were the slayers of Bahadur,\" and \"The king of the land became a martyr at Sea.\" Bahadur Shah was 20 years of age when he ascended the throne, reigned 11 lunar years, and was slain at the age of 31. After his death his nephew Miran Muhammad Shah was raised to the throne of Gujrat.\n\nBahadur Shah I, Teybuddin Shah Alam, surnamed Kutbuddin Shah Alam, formerly called prince Muzzim, was the second son of the emperor Alamgir I, born at Burhanpur in the Dakhani on the 4th October 1643 O.S., 30th Rajab, 1053 A.H. At the time of his father's death, which took place at Ahmadabad, on the 21st February 1707 O.S., 28th Zil-Ka'da 1118 A.H., he being then at Kabul, his younger brother, prince Azim, was proclaimed sovereign of all India in perfect disregard of the late emperor's will. Prince Muzzim, with better reason, assumed the crown at Kabul with the title of Bahadur Shah; and both brothers prepared to assert their pretensions by force of arms. They assembled very large armies, and met at length at Dhaulpur not far to the south of Agra. A bloody battle ensued on Sunday the 8th June 1707, O.S., 18th Rab'i I, 1119 A.H., in which prince Azim and his two grown-up sons Bedar Bakht and Waliqjan were killed. Bahadur Shah reigned nearly five lunar years and died at Lahore on Monday the 18th of February 1712, O.S., 21st Muharram, 1124 A.H., in the 71st lunar year of his age. He was buried in the environs of Delhi near the tomb of Khwaja Khizraddin, where he had built during his life a mosque entirely of white marble named Moti Masjid. His tomb is also built of the same stone. He received the title of \"Khuld Mansil,\" i.e., \"May his mansion be in paradise,\" after his death. He left four sons, viz., Ma'izuddin Jahandar Shah, Azim-ush-Shan, Rafi-ush-Shan, and Jahangir Shah, among whom a battle ensued, wherein the three latter brothers were killed, and Jahandar Shan ascended the throne.\n\nBahadur Shah II, the present and last king of Delhi whose title in full is Abu'l Muzaffar Sirajuddin Muhammad Bahadur Shah, a lineal descendant from Amir Taimur; he is the son of Akbar Shah II, on whose death he succeeded him on the 28th September 1837, 28th Jamada II, 1258 A.H. He was born on Tuesday the 24th of October 1775, 28th Shaban, 1189 A.H.; and Abu'l Musaffar is the chronogram of his birth. His mother's name was Lal Bai. A stipend or pension of one lakh of rupees monthly was allowed him by the British Government. He is an excellent Persian scholar and an elegant Urdu poet, and Zafar is his poetical name. His Diwan or Book of Odes was printed some years ago at Delhi. He is supposed to be the principal instigator of the mutiny of the native troops throughout India in 1857, and is now deposed and tried, but his life has been guaranteed. In October 1858 he was sent down to Calcutta, from which place he embarked on board H.M.S. Megara\" on Saturday the 14th December 1858, for Rangoon, accompanied by two of his wives, a son, and a grandson, and thus ended the royal race of Taimur in India. His sons Mirza Mughal and Mirza Khwaja Sultan, and a grandson named Mirza Abdul Bakr, who were known to have taken a prominent part in the atrocities attending the insurrection, were captured on the 22nd September 1857 at the tomb of Humayun, and shot on the spot. During the mutiny in 1857, Bahadur Shah had struck a new coin with the following inscription:\n\nBahadur Singh (Rao), vide Rao Bahadur Singh.\n\nBahai, vide Bahai-uddin 'Amili.\n\nBahar, poetical name of Tek Chand, which see.\n\nBahai-uddin, a learned Arabian, known as a favorite of Sultan Salih-uddin (Saladin) and the historian of that prince's life. He flourished about the year 1190 A.H., 580 A.H. An edition of his work appeared at Leyden in 1766.\n\nBahar Bano, daughter of Jahangir, married to Prince Tahmuras, the son of Prince Dainial in their childhood.\n\nBahar Bano Bogam, another daughter of Jahangir, was married to Tahmura a son of prince Dainial.\n\nBahai-uddin, the son of Fakhr-uddin. His father was the first king of the second branch of the Sultans of Ghori. Bahai-uddin was the second king, and is said to have reigned 14 years. Imam Fakhr-uddin Razi who flourished in his time and died in 1210 A.D., 606 A.H., dedicated the work called \"Risala Haiziyat,\" or book of geometry to him. After the death of Bahai-uddin, his son Jalal-uddin succeeded him. He was slain by Sultan Muhammad of Khwairizm, and appears to have been the last of this branch.\n\nBahadur Singh, the only surviving son of Rajah Man Singh Kachwaha.\n\nBahai-uddin, governor of Isfahan, and author of the \"Muntakhab-ul-Akhbar,\" an abridged history of the patriarchs and prophets, also of Muhammad and his descendants, with a good description of the cities of Mecca and Madina. He flourished about the year 1271 A.D., 670 A.H.\n\nBahai-uddin 'Amili (Shaikh), a native of Amul in Persia, and son of Shaikh Husain. His poetical name is Bahai. He is the author of several works, one of which is a Masnavi or poem called \"Nanwa-Halwa,\" Bread and Pudding. He flourished in the time of Shah Abbas the Great, king of Persia; died at Isfahan on Tuesday the 21st of August 1621, O.S., 12th\nShawwal, 1030 A.H., and was buried, agreeably to his request, at Mashhad. Imad-uddaula Abu Talib, the prime minister of Shah Abbas, found the chronogram of the year of his death in the words \"Shaikh Bah\u00e1-uddin W\u00e1e.\" Besides the above-mentioned Masnavi and many Arabic works, he has left a Diwan and a Kashi, or Adversaria.\n\nBah\u00e1-uddin Muhammad, \u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u06c1\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 (Jalal al-Din) or Jal\u00e1l (Shahid) of 'Amil. This person is mentioned by H.M. Elliot, Esq., in his \"Historians of India,\" and appears to be the same with the preceding. He was a Persian mathematician, says he, and lived in the reign of Shah Abbas the Great. He was noted among his countrymen for a supposed peculiar power which he possessed over the magic and writing of talismans, and was one of the most pious devotees of his time. His works on various subjects are much read in Persia, particularly one entitled \"Kashi,\" or the Beggar's Wallet, being an universal miscellany of literature. The \"Jama-ul-Abb\u00e1s\u00ed,\" a concise and comprehensive treatise on Shia law in twenty books, is generally considered as the work of Bah\u00e1-uddin Muhammad 'Amil\u00ed, but that lawyer only lived to complete the first five books, dedicating his work to Shah Abbas. The remaining fifteen books were subsequently added by Nizam Ibn-Husain-al-S\u00e1w\u00e1i.\n\nBah\u00e1-uddin Nakshband (Khwaja), \u0634\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u06a9\u0634\u0628\u0646\u062f, a famous learned Musulm\u00e1n who died on Monday the 1st of March 1389 A.D., 2nd Rabi I, 791 A.H., and was buried at Bukh\u00e1ra.\n\nBah\u00e1-uddin Nakshband (Shaikh), \u0634\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u06a9\u0634\u0628\u0646\u062f, a celebrated saint and the founder of an Order of Sufis, distinguished by the title of Nakshband\u00ed. He is the author of the \"Huj\u00e1t N\u00e1m\u00fa,\" an esteemed moral poem. He died at Harafa in Persia 1453 A.D., 857 A.H. He appears also to be the author of a work on Sufism called \"Dal\u00ed-ul-'Ashk\u00edn.\"\n\nBah\u00e1-uddin Sam, \u0633\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646, son of Ghay\u00e1s-uddin Mahmud, king of Gh\u00f3or and Ghazni. He succeeded his father in 1210 A.D., 607 A.H., at the age of fourteen years, but was after three months defeated by Al\u00e1-uddin Ata\u00ed, son of Jah\u00e1n S\u00f3z, who reigned four years in Gh\u00f3or and Ghazni, and fell in battle against Taj-uddin Elduz in 1214 A.D. Bah\u00e1-uddin S\u00e1m was, after his defeat, taken captive by the governor of Ilir\u00e1t, and sent to Khw\u00e1rizm Sh\u00e1h, who at the time of the invasion of Chingiz Kh\u00e1n, threw him along with his brother into a river where both were drowned.\n\nBah\u00e1-uddin Shirazi, \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646, a celebrated K\u00e1z\u00ed of Shir\u00e1z, who died in the year 1380 A.D., 782 A.H.\n\nBah\u00e1-uddin Wald (Maulana), \u0648\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646, a native of Balkh and the father of the celebrated Jal\u00e1luddin Maulawi R\u00fami. He flourished and enjoyed distinguished honors in the time of Sultan Muhammad, surnamed Khw\u00e1rizm. He was an enthusiastic follower of the doctrine of the Sufis, and became so celebrated as a preacher and expounder, that people flocked from all parts of Persia to hear him discourse. In the latter part of his life, he left his native country and went and dwelt at Konia (Iconium) in Asiatic Turkey, where he died about the year 1230 or 1233 A.D., 628 or 631 A.H., and his son succeeded him as the head of the sect.\n\nBah\u00e1-uddin Zikaria (Shaikh), \u0632\u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646, a Muhammedan saint of Mult\u00e1n, was the son of Kuth-uddin Muhammad, the son of Kam\u00e1l-uddin Kurschi. He was born at Kotkror in Mult\u00e1n in 1170 A.D., 565 A.H. After his studies he journeyed to Baghdad and became a disciple of Shaikh Shah\u00e1b-uddin Suharward\u00ed. He afterwards returned to Mult\u00e1n where he became intimate with Farid-uddin Shakarpanj. He died at Mult\u00e1n on the 7th November, 1266 A.D., 7th Safar, 665 A.H., aged 100 lunar years, and is still considered one of the most revered saints of India. He left enormous wealth to his heirs. His son Saikh Sadr-uddin died at Mult\u00e1n in 1309 A.D., 709 A.H.\n\nBah\u00e1-uddin, \u0628\u06c1\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 (Bad\u00ed-udd\u00edn or Bogo-nedd\u00edn) a Muhammedan saint whose tomb is in the neighbourhood of Bukh\u00e1ra, called Maz\u00e1ri Bogo-nedd\u00edn. During the invasion of the Russians at that place, it is said, that a book, written in verse in the Persian language, was found in the tomb of this saint. It is said in this book that in the 82nd year of the Hijrah (1865 A.D.) the Christians will rush upon Tashkand like a river. In the 84th year (1867 A.D.) they will occupy Samarqand, and sweep it away like a prickly thorn. In the 88th year (1871 A.D.) the Christians will take Bukh\u00e1ra, and convert it into a level like the steppe. In the year 90th but one (1872) the Khw\u00e1rizmians will run out of their own accord to meet them like children.\n\nBahisht\u00ed, \u0628\u062d\u06cc\u062b\u06cc, poetical name of Sheikh Ramz\u00e1n, the son of 'Abdul Muhsin, an author who died 1571 A.D., 979 A.H.\n\nBahjat, \u0628\u0647\u062c\u062a, or Behjat, author of a Diwan which contains chiefly Ghazals, and at the end a very silly Kaseada in praise of the Europeans. He was living in Lakhnau in 1797 A.D., 1212 A.H.\n\nBahlol, \u0628\u0647\u0644\u0648\u0644, who lived during the reign of the khalif H\u00e1run-al-kashid, was one of those people who pass amongst the Musulmans either for saints or madmen. Although surnamed Al-Majn\u00fan, or the Fool, he was possessed of a great deal of wit.\n\nBahloli, \u0628\u0647\u0644\u0648\u0644\u06cc, a poet whose Diwan was found in the Library of Tipu Sultan.\n\nBahlol Lodi (Sultan), \u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0647\u0644\u0648\u0644, a king of Dohl\u00ed of the tribe of Afgh\u00e1ns called Lodi.

In the year 1450 A.D., 854 A.H., Bahlol, during the absence at Badshah of Sultan Al\u00e1-uddin, son of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, took possession of Delhi.

To reduce this r\u0101j\u0101, an army was sent, about the year 1780 A.D., composed partly of the Naw\u0101b's troops, and partly of the Company's sepoys; but owing to the intrigues of Haider Beg Khan, the minister of the Naw\u0101b Waz\u012br Asaf-ud-daula, and the native collectors who extorted large sums from the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs, this measure failed of success.

He committed the greatest cruelties on the Musulm\u00e1ns, in every advantage shewing no quarter to age or sex, and even ripping up women with child. The emperor found it necessary to march in person against him, and he was besieged in the fortress of Lohgarh, which was taken, but Banda found means to escape, and raise new insurrections. In the reign of the emperor Farrukh\u00e1s\u00ed, 'Abdus Samad Kh\u00e1n governor of Kashmir was sent against the rebels with a great army. After many severe engagements, he forced Banda to take refuge in a fortress, which was blockaded so effectually, as to cut off every supply. The garrison was reduced to the necessity of eating cows, horses, asses, and other animals forbidden by their laws; when at length, having no provision of any sort left, and being reduced to the extremity of famine and disease, they begged for quarter. 'Abdus Samad Kh\u00e1n, having planted a standard on the plain, commanded them to come out and lay their arms under it, which they did. He then divided the meanest sort among his chiefs, who cut off their heads; and threw their bodies into a river near the fortress. Banda and other captives were sent to Delhi, through which he was carried in an iron cage upon an elephant, dressed in a robe of gold brocade. The Sikhs bore the insults of the populace with the greatest firmness, and steadily refused the emperor's offers of life if they would embrace the Musulm\u00e1n faith. They were put to death, a hundred each day, on the ensuing seven days. On the eighth day Banda and his son, were put to death without the city. A dagger was put into his hands, and he was commanded to kill his infant son; but refusing, the child was slain by the executioner, his heart torn out, and forced into the father's mouth.

He was, however, totally defeated near Angoria on Friday the 21st July, 1402 A.D., 19th Zul-hijjah, 804 A.H., and taken prisoner; and when the proud conqueror asked him what he would have done with him if he had obtained the victory, Baiazid answered that he would have confined him in an iron cage. \"Such then shall be thy fate,\" rejoined Tamerlane, and ordered him to be carried about with his camp in an iron cage.

It is related that he was born at Bustam in Khurasan, of which country he was king; but abandoning regal pomp and cares for the tranquillity of the ascetic life, he came with twelve attending disciples to Chatig\u00e1n. Their arrival was promptly opposed by the king of the fairies and the\nattendant genii, who desired them forthwith to depart. Sultan B\u00e1iz\u00e1id, with feigned humility, entreated to be allowed to remain that night and to occupy only as much ground as could be illumined by a single lamp, called in Bengali, chat\u00ed or chat; on obtaining their consent, he kindled from his urine a lamp of such radiance, that its light extended to Tik Nahr, a distance of 120 miles, and scorched the terrified genii, who fled from its flame in dismay. In commemoration of this event, the place was named Chatagram, in common parlance, Chag\u00e1gon, signifying the village of the lamp. This insult and breach of confidence, led to implacable war in the part of the genii, whom Sultan B\u00e1iz\u00e1id, in various conditions, drove from the field; and in his strenuous exertions dropped a ring where the cenotaph now stands\u2014his Karanphuli, or ear-ring, fell in the river, which thence was named the \"Karanphuli;\" and a sankh, or shell, dropped from his hand, into the other stream, from which it derived the name of San-khanti. Sultan B\u00e1iz\u00e1id then became a Gorchela (i.e., did penance in the tomb) for 12 years: after endowing it with lands to keep it in repair and defray the expenses of pilgrims and the twelve disciples\u2014he proceeded to Makanpur, and was succeeded by his disciple Sh\u00e1h\u2014who in the hope of an eternal reward, performed the penance of standing for 12 years on one leg, after which he also proceeded to Makanpur; leaving the cenotaph under the charge of Sh\u00e1h Pir, an attending disciple of B\u00e1iz\u00e1id.

The Kar\u00e1uli raja too boasts his descent from Bijnip\u00e1l, and if any faith can be placed in a \"Bans\u00e1oli or genealogical tree,\" he has a fair claim to the benefits, real or imaginary, resulting therefrom.\n\nBijai Singh, \u0628\u06cc\u0627 \u0633\u06cc\u0646\u06af, son of raja Abhai Singh, the son of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ajit Singh, R\u00e1hor of Jadhpur, succeeded to the raja in 1732 A.D., 1167 A.H.

His conceit had roused the jealousy of Amir Al\u00edsh\u00e9r, Bin\u00e1i tried to conciliate his favour by writing a Kas\u00edda in his praise, but received no reward, he therefore substituted the name of Sult\u00e1n Ahmad M\u00edrz\u00e1 for that of Al\u00edsh\u00e9r, saying that he would not give away his daughters without dowry. Al\u00edsh\u00e9r was so enraged at this, that he obtained a death-warrant against him. Bin\u00e1i fled to Mawarrunnahr. He was killed in the massacre of Sh\u00e1h Ismu'il in 1612 A.D., 918 A.H.

He was also an excellent Hind\u00fa poet, and was honored with the title of Kabr\u00eda or the royal poet.

Akbar was for a long time inconsolable for the death of B\u00edrb\u00e1l, and as the raja's body was never found, a report gained currency that he was still alive among the prisoners, and it was so much encouraged by Akbar, that a long time afterwards an impostor appeared in his name; and as this second B\u00edrb\u00e1l died before he reached the court, Akbar again wore mourning as for his friend.

He was a native of Samarqand, and a sprightly satirical poet; much dreaded by his contemporaries, on account of his wit and caustic humour. He was the especial panegyrist of Sultan B\u00e1ikara Mirz\u00e1, the son of Umar Shaikh and grandson of Amir Taimur. When Prince B\u00e1ikara ascended the throne in 1394 A.D., he ordered that the sum of five hundred ducats (in Turkish bish yuz altun) should be paid to Burandak. By a mistake of the Secretary, he received only two hundred; and therefore addressed the following lines to the Sultan:\n\n\"The Shah, the terror of his foes,\nWho well the sound of flattery knows,\nThe conqueror of the world, the lord\nOf nations vanquished by his sword,\nGave, while he praised my verse, to me\nFive hundred ducats as a fee.\nGreat was the Sultan's generous mood,\nGreat is his servant's gratitude,\nAnd great the sum; but strange to say,\nThree hundred melted by the way!\nPerhaps the words in Turkish tongue\nConvenient meaning may contrive;\nOr else my greedy ear was wrong,\nThat turn'd two hundred into five.\"\n\nThe Sultan was extremely entertained at the readiness of the poet; and sending for him, assured him that the words \"bish yuz altun\" signified in Turkish a thousand ducats, which he ordered to be immediately paid. Dublin University Magazine for 1840. The year of Burandak's death is unknown.

He succeeded his father Daria 'Imad Sh\u00e1h in the government of Ber\u00e1r, when but a child. His minister Taufal Kh\u00e1n, became regent; and before the prince was of an age to assume the reins of his empire, Taufal Kh\u00e1n, assisted by the ruler of Kh\u00e1ndesh and by the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi court, usurped the government. He eventually confined his sovereign in irons in the fort of Parnala, and assumed the title of king. In the year 1568 A.D., 980 A.H., Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h marched against Taufal Kh\u00e1n, under the pretence of releasing the imprisoned prince from his confinement. He took the fort of G\u00e1wal by capitulation, defeated Taufal Kh\u00e1n and made him prisoner with his son; but instead of placing the captive monarch on the throne of Ber\u00e1r, sent him with the usurper and his son to be confined in one of the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi forts, where they were all subsequently strangled by the king's order. Thus the family of 'Imad Sh\u00e1h and that of the usurper Taufal Kh\u00e1n became extinct.\n\nBurhan Nakid, \u0628\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u06a9\u06cc\u062f, a poet who is the author of the poem entitled \"Dil Ash\u00f3b,\" dedicated to the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.\n\nBurhan Nizam Sh\u00e1h I, \u0628\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0634\u0627\u0647, ascended the throne of Ahmadnagar in the Dakh\u00e1n after the death of his father Ahmad Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h in 1608 A.D., 914 A.H., in the seventh year of his age.

In August 1781 demands were made upon him, by the Governor-General, for additional tribute to be paid to the Company, as the sovereign power now requiring assistance in its agency. The raja declined, pleading willingness, but inability. His army, led by Mr. Hay, was ordered at Banaras; a revolt took place in his behalf on the 20th August; nearly two companies of sepoys and their officers were destroyed\u2014and the raja escaped in the confusion. The Governor-General immediately assumed control of the province; and troops were called in to oppose the raja, who now headed the numbers flocking to his support. He was defeated at Latifpur\u2014and lastly, his stronghold of Bijajgurh was seized, and his family plundered by a force under Major Poynham. The raja had fled, on his reverses at Latifpur, to Bundelkhand. His government was declared vacant, and the zamindari bestowed on the next heir, a nephew of the raja, a minor. After these transactions at Banaras, the Governor-General proceeded to Audh, to obtain an adjustment of the heavy debts due to the Company by the Wazir 'Assaf-ud-daula. The territories of the Begams, (one, the mother of Shuja-ud-daula, the late Nawab\u2014the other, the mother of the Wazir) were seized, on a charge of aiding the insurrection of Chait Singh. The raja found an asylum in Gwalior for 29 years, and died there on the 29th March, 1810 A.D. The lands were transferred to a collateral branch of the family, the present representative of which is named Raja Udut Narain. See Balwant Singh. His estates, with title of raja, were presented to his nephew Babu Muhip Narain, grandson of Raja Balwant Singh.\n\n**Chand**, also called Trikala, from his supposed prophetic spirit, was a celebrated Hindustani poet or bard. He flourished towards the close of the twelfth century of the Christian era. He may be called the poet laureate of Prithviraj, the Chauhan emperor of Delhi who, in his last battle with Shahabuddin Ghori, was taken prisoner, and conveyed to Ghazni, where his bard, Chand, followed him. Both perished, by their own hands, after causing the death of their implacable foe, Shahabuddin. Like the Greek bard Homer, countries and cities have commemorated the honor of having been the place of birth of this the most popular poet of the Hindustani. Dehlia, Kanauj, Mahoba, and the Panjab, assert their respective claims; but his own testimony is decisive, whence it appears that he was a native of Lahore. In his \"Prithviraj Chauhan Rasa,\" when enumerating some of the heroes, friends and partizans of his hero, he says, \"Nidhar was born in Kanauj, Siluk and Jait, the father and son, at Abu; in Mundaya the Parihar, and in Kurrik Kangra the Haoli Rao, in Nagor, Balbhadar, and Chand, the bard, at Lahore.\"\n\n**Chand Sandagar**, a Bangali merchant.\n\n**Chand**, vide Teik Chand.\n\n**Chanda Kunwar**, the wife of Maharaja Khara Singh of Lahore.\n\n**Chanda**, also called Mahlik, a dancing girl, or queen of Haidarabad, was a poetess of much taste and merit.

In the year 1799 A.D., in the midst of a dance, in which she bore the chief part, she presented a British officer with a copy of her poems, accompanied with the following complimentary observations, in the form of the usual gazaal:\n\nSince my heart drank from the cup of a fascinating eye,\nI wonder beside myself, like one whom wine bewilders.\nThy searching glances leave nothing uneaten;\nThy face, bright as flame, consumes my heart.\nThou soughtest a Nazar: I offer thee my head;\nAlbeit thy heart is not unveiled to me.\nMy eyes fixed on thy lineaments\u2014emotion agitates my soul,\nFresh excitement beats impatient in my heart.\nAll that Chand asks is, that, in either world,\nThou wouldest preserve the ashes of her heart by thy side\n\nGarcin de Tassy informs us that there is a copy of her Diwan in the East India House Library, which she herself presented to Captain Malcolm on the 1st of October, 1799 A.D.\n\n**Chanda Sahib**, surname of Husain Dost Khan, a relation of Dost Ali Khan, Nawab of Arcot, whose daughter he had married. He had made his way to the highest offices of the government by the services of his sword, and was esteemed the ablest soldier that had of late years appeared in the Carnatic. He inveigled the queen of Trichinopoly, and got possession of the city in 1736 A.D. He was taken prisoner by the Marhattas on the 26th March, 1741 A.D., and imprisoned in the fort of Sitaram, but was released by the aid of Mons. Duplex in 1745, and appointed Nawab of the Carnatic by Muzaffar Jang. He was put to death in 1752 A.D., 1st Sha'ban, 1166 A.H. by the Marhattas, and his head sent to Muhammad Ali Khan who was made Nawab of Arcot by the English, who treated it with ignominy.\n\n**Chandar Bhan**, a Brahman of Patiala, well-versed in the Persian language, was employed as a Munshi in the service of the prince Darai Shikoh, the eldest son of the emperor Shah Jahangir.

After the tragic death of his employer, he retired to Banaras where he died in the year 1682 A.D., 1073 A.H. He had also built a house at Agra, of which no traces now remain.\n\n**Chand Bibi (Sultana)**, was the daughter of Husain Nizam Shah I of Ahmadnagar in the Dakhshan, sister to Murad Nizam Shah, and wife of Ali Adil Shah I, of Bijapur. After the death of her husband in 1680 A.D., 988 A.H., she had been queen and dowager-regent of the neighbouring kingdom of Bijapur during the minority of her nephew Ibrahim Adil Shah II, and was one of the most able politicians of her day. The Mughals under Prince Murad, Shah Shujah, proceeded in November, 1595 A.D., Rabi' II, 1004 A.H., and besieged Ahmadnagar for some months, while Chand Sultana defended the place with masculine resolution. At the same time there being a scarcity of provisions in the Mughal camp, the prince and Khafi Khan thought it advisable to enter into a treaty with the besieged. It was stipulated by Chand Bibi that the prince should keep possession of Bijapur, and that Ahmadnagar and its dependencies, should remain with her in the name of Bahadur, the grandson of Burhan Shah.

He was born in 1154 A.D., 549 A.H., and at the age of 13 he began to reign, but the conspiracies of his subjects obliged him to fly for safety to Avant Kh\u00e1n, a Tartar prince, whom he supported on his throne, and whose daughter he married. These ties were not binding, Avant Kh\u00e1n joined against Changos, who took signal vengeance on his enemies, and after almost unexampled vicissitudes obtained, at the age of 49, a complete victory over all those who had endeavoured to effect his ruin, and received from the Kh\u00e1n of Tartary, the title of Kh\u00e1n-ul-Mulk, 1296 A.D., 602 A.H., and was declared emperor of Tartary. His capital was Karakorum. In the space of 22 years he conquered Coroa, Cathay, part of China, and the noblest provinces of Asia, and became acknowledged a conqueror as Alexander the Great.

To secure the independence of his posterity against the encroaching power of the Marhattas, he entered into a close alliance with the Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o I about the year 1733 A.D., 1146 A.H., and at his demise, he bequeathed him a third of his dominions, under an express stipulation, that his posterity should be protected by the Peshw\u00e1 and his heirs.\n\nChatur Sal died 1735 A.D., leaving two sons, Hirde S\u00e1h and Jagat R\u00e1j.

Gangadhar B\u00e1la was nominated by the Peshw\u00e1 as his n\u00e1h to superintend the collections.

He formed the acquaintance of this young and beautiful woman, and then resolved to be married. But the Begam did not wish the union with a man so inferior to herself to take place where she was known, and so obtained the permission of the Chief Commissioner to leave Audh on the pretence of making a pilgrimage to Mecca.

His death and the circumstances connected with it, so much affected the king his father who was in a declining state of health, that he became every day worse, and died six months after.

He was also governor of Bengal for some time, and on his return to the Dakhan, the emperor, being displeased with him on some account, ordered Mahabat Khan to strike off his head, which he did, and sent it to the king. This circumstance took place 1626 A.D., 1034 A.H.\n\nDarab Khan, son of Mukhtar Khan Sabzwari, a nobleman in the service of the emperor Alamgir. He died on the 24th June, 1679 A.D., 25th Jamadi I, 1090 A.H.\n\nDara Shikoh, the eldest and favorite son of the emperor Shah Jahan, was born on the 20th March, 1615 O.S., 29th Safar, 1024 A.H. His mother, Mumtaz Mahal, was the daughter of Asaf Khan, wazir, the brother of Nur Jahan Begum. In the 20th year of his age, i.e., in the year 1633 A.D., 1043 A.H., he was married to the princess Nadira, the daughter of his uncle Sultan Parvez, by whom he had two sons, viz., Sulaiman Shikoh and Siphr Shikoh. In 1658 A.D., during the illness of his father, several battles took place between him and his brother Aurangzeb Alamgir for the throne, in which Dara being defeated, was at last obliged to fly towards Sindh, where he was captured by the chief of that country and brought to the presence of Aurangzeb, loaded with chains, on a sorry elephant without housings; was exposed through all the principal places and then led off to a prison in old Delhi, where after a few days, in the night of the 29th of August, 1659 O.S., 21st Zil Hijjah, 1069 A.H., he was murdered by the order of Aurangzeb; his body exhibited next morning to the populace on an elephant, and his head cut off and carried to the emperor, who ordered it to be placed on a platter, and to be wiped and washed in his presence. When he had satisfied himself that it was the head of Dara, he began to weep, and with many expressions of sorrow, directed it with its corpse to be interred in the tomb of the emperor Humayun. Siphr Shikoh, his son, who was also taken captive and brought with his father, was sent away in confinement to Gwalior. Sulaiman Shikoh, his eldest son, who, after the defeat of his father had taken refuge in Srinagar for some time, was subsequently, in 1670 A.D., 1071 A.H., given up by the raja of that place to the officers of Aurangzeb and conveyed to Delhi. He was then sent to Gwalior, where he and his brother Siphr Shikoh both died within a short space. Dara Shikoh is the author of the work called \"Safinat-ul-Aulia,\" an abridgment of the Life of Muhammad, with a circumstantial detail of his wives, children, and companions, &c., also of a work entitled \"Majma-ul-Bahrain,\" (i.e., the uniting of both seas) in which he endeavours to reconcile the Brahman religion with the Muhammadan; citing passages from the Koran to prove the several points. In 1656 he likewise, with the same intent, caused a Persian translation to be made by the Brahmins of Banaras, of the Apnikhat, a work in the Sanskrit language, of which the title signifies \"the word that is not to be said;\" meaning the secret that is not to be revealed. This book he named \"Sarri-Azrak,\" or Secret of Secrets; but his enemies took advantage of it, to traduce him in the esteem of his father's Muhammadan soldiers, and to stigmatize him with the epithets of Kafir and Rafiz (unbeliever and blasphemer), and finally effected his ruin; for Aurangzeb his brother made a pretence of that, and consequently had all his bigoted Muhammadans to join him. Monsieur Anquetil du Perron has given a translation of this work, in two large volumes in quarto, on which a very good critique may be found in the Second Number of the \"Edinburgh Review.\" There is also a copy of the Persian version of this work in the British Museum, with a MS. translation, made by N.B.

When during the fall of Delhi everybody fled from the city, Dard remained in poverty contented with his lot. He was a Sufi and a good singer. A crowd of musicians used to assemble at his house on the 22nd of every month. Some biographers say that he was a disciple of Shah Gulshan, meaning Shaikh Sadullah. Besides a Diwan in Persian and one in Rekhta, he has written a treatise on Sufism called \"Risala Wafidat.\" He died on Thursday the 3rd of January, 1785 A.D., 24th Safar, 1199 A.H.\n\nList of his Works.\n\nAli Nala-wa-Dard.

He served several years under Alamgir, and when Bahadur Shah, on his departure from the Dakhin, gave the viceroyalty of that kingdom to the Amir-ul-Umra, Zulfikar Khan, as that chief could not be spared from court, he left the administration of the government to Daud Khan, who was to act as his lieutenant. In the reign of Farrukhsiyar when the Amir-ul-Umra Husain Ali Khan marched towards Dakhin, Daud Khan received secret orders from the emperor to oppose and cut him off. Accordingly when the Amir-ul-Umra arrived at Burhanpur, Daud Khan, who regarded himself as the hero of his age, prepared to receive him. The engagement was very bloody on both sides; a matchlock ball struck Daud Khan, and he fell down dead on the seat of his elephant.

This prince was much addicted to sensual excesses; and the propensity was rendered more degrading by his inclination to associate with persons of low origin and mean connections, by whom he was induced to attack the frontiers of the kingdom of Dakhin. He had several skirmishes with Munaim Khan, Khan Khakan, governor of Jaunpur, who was subsequently joined by his master, the emperor Akbar, when an obstinate battle took place on the 30th of July, 1576 A.D., 21st Rabi'II, 983 A.H., in which Daud Shah was defeated and obliged to retire to a fort on the borders of Katak. After this peace was concluded, by which Daud Shah was invested with the government of Orisa and Katak, and the other provinces of Bengal were occupied by Munaim Khan in the name of the emperor. The year of this event is commemorated in a Persian Historian. After the death of Munaim Khan, which took place the same year at Lakhnauti, Daud Khan re-took the provinces of Bengal, but was soon attacked by Khan Turukman, who was appointed governor, when after a short engagement, Daud Khan was taken prisoner, and suffered death as a rebel. From that period, the kingdom of Bengal was subdued, and fell under the subjection of the emperor Akbar. Thus ended the rule of the Purbi or independent eastern kings of Bengal.\n\nDaud Tai, a Musalm\u00e1n doctor who was master of several sciences.

He is the author of the \"Sharah Haikal,\" \"Akhlak Jalali,\" \"Istah Wajib,\" (on the existence of God) \"Risala Zaurs,\" (on Sufism), \"Haasha Shamshiri\" and \"Anwar Shaha.\" He also wrote the \"Sharah Akled\" and marginal notes on \"Sharah Tajrid.\" The Akhlak Jalali, a translation from the Arabic, the original of which appeared in the 10th century under the name of \"Kitab-ut-Tahara,\" by an Arabian author, minister of the imperial house of Hoy. Two centuries after, it was translated into Persian by Abu Nasr, and named \"Akhlak Nasiri,\" or the morals of Nasir, being enriched with some important additions taken from Abu Sina. In the 16th century, it assumed a still further improved form, under the present designation, the Akhlak Jalali or morals of Jalal. This book which is the most esteemed ethical work of middle Asia, was translated into English by W.F. Thompson, Esq. of the Bengal Civil Service, London, 1839.\n\nDawar Baksh (Sultan), surnamed Mirza Bulaki, was the son of Sultan Khusro. When his grandfather, the emperor Jahangir, died on his way from Kashmir to Lahore in October, 1627 O.S., Safar 1037 A.H., Asaf Khan, wazir, who was all along determined to support Shah Jah\u00e1n, the son of the late emperor, immediately sent off a messenger to summon him from the Dakhin. In the meantime, to sanction his own measures by the appearance of legal authority, he released prince Dawar Baksh from prison, and proclaimed him king. Nur Jah\u00e1n Begam, endeavouring to support the cause of Shahriar, her son-in-law, was placed under temporary restraint by her brother, the wazir, who then continued his march to Lahore. Shahriar who was already in that city, forming a coalition with two, the sons of his uncle,\nthe late prince D\u00e1ni\u00e9l marched out to oppose 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n. The battle ended in his defeat; he was given up by his adherents, and afterwards put to death together with D\u00e1war Bakhsh and the two sons of D\u00e1ni\u00e9l, by orders from Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n who ascended the throne.

He was a Gw\u00e1la by caste, and flourished in the reign of the Emperor Farrukh-siyar. The wonderful feats of this man are sung or recited accompanied by the beat of a dhol throughout Hindust\u00e1n. A full and affecting account of this hero is given in the \"Bengal Annual\" published at Calcutta in 1833, p. 169.\n\nDaya Ram, \u062f\u06cc\u0627 \u0631\u0627\u0645, a chief of H\u00e1tras, tributary to the Honorable Company, who, about the year 1814 A.D., confiding in the extraordinary strength of his fort, shewed a spirit of contumacy and disobedience. A train of Artillery was brought against this place from Cawnpur, and a few hours of its tremendous fire breached the boasted fortification.\n\nDil\u00e1mi, \u062f\u06cc\u0644\u0645\u06cc, and S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed were two dynasties which divided between them the kingdom of Persia towards the beginning of the 10th century. They both rose to power through the favor of the Khal\u00edfe of Baghdad, but they speedily threw off the yoke. The Dil\u00e1mi divided into two branches, exercised sovereign authority in Kirm\u00e1n, Ir\u00e1k, F\u00e1ris, Khuz\u00edst\u00e1n, and Lar\u00edst\u00e1n, always acknowledging their nominal dependence on the Khal\u00edfe, and during the whole period of their rule, one of the southern branches of this family was vested with the dignity of Amir-ul-Umra, or vizir, and managed the affairs of the khal\u00edfe. Several of the Dil\u00e1mi were able and wise rulers, but Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed put an end to the rule of the northern branch in 1029 A.D., and the S\u00e1lj\u00faks subjugated the southern one in 1066 A.D., by the capture of Baghdad, their last stronghold. Their more powerful rivals, the S\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed, had obtained from the Khal\u00edfe the government of Transoxiana in 874 A.D.; and to this Isma'il, the most celebrated prince of the family, speedily added Khw\u00e1rizm, Balh, Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, S\u00edst\u00e1n, and many portions of northern Turki-st\u00e1n. Rebellions of provincial governors distracted the Samanida monarchy towards the end of the 10th century; and in 999 A.D. their dominions north of Persia were taken possession of by the Kh\u00e1n of R\u00e1shghar, the Persian provinces being added by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed to his dominions.

This robber assumed the lofty title of king of the two worlds, and aimed, doubtless, at carving out for himself some independent principality, after the example of Hydar 'Ali, whose service he originally commenced his adventurous career. Subsequently he incurred the displeasure of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, who chained him like a wild beast to the walls of his dungeons in Serangapatan, from which \"durance vile\" he had been liberated by the English soldiers after the taking of Serangapatan. He now threatened Mysore with 6,000 cavalry. The Government of Madras instructed Colonel Wellesley to pursue him wherever he could be found and to hang him on the first tree. His subjugation and subsequent death (in 1800) with the extirpation of his formidable band of free-booters, relieved the English Government from an enemy, who, though by no means equal to Hydar and Tip\u00fa, might eventually have afforded considerable annoyance.\n\nDil, \u062f\u0644, poetical name of Zorawar Kh\u00e1n of Sirkar Kol. He is the author of a Diw\u00e1n and a few Masnav\u00ed.\n\nDil\u00e1war Khan, \u062f\u06cc\u0644\u0648\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646, founder of the dynasty of the Muhammadan kings of M\u00e1liwa. The Hind\u00fa histories of the kingdom of M\u00e1liwa go back as far as the reign of R\u00e9j\u00e1 Bikarm\u00e1j\u00edt, whose accession to that kingdom has given rise to an era which commences 57 years before Christ. After him reigned R\u00e9j\u00e1 Bh\u00f3j and many others who are all mentioned among the r\u00e9j\u00e1s of Hindust\u00e1n. During the reign of Ghay\u00e1s-udd\u00edn Balhan king of Dehl\u00ed in the year 1310 A.D., 710 A.H., the Muhammadans first invaded and conquered the provinces of M\u00e1liwa; after which it acknowledged allegiance to that crown until the reign of Muhammed Sh\u00e1h Tughl\u00e1k II, 1387 A.D., 789 A.H. At this period Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, a descendant on his mother's side from Sult\u00e1n Shah\u00e1b-udd\u00edn Gl\u00f3r\u00ed, was appointed governor of M\u00e1liwa, previously to the accession of Muhammed Tughl\u00e1k, and he subsequently established his independence. In the year 1398 A.D., 801 A.H., Muhammed Sh\u00e1h, king of Dehl\u00ed, being driven from his throne by Amir Taim\u00far (Tamerlane,) made his escape to Gujr\u00e1t, and then to M\u00e1liwa, where he remained three years, after which, in 1401 A.D., 804 A.H., he, at the instance of the Dehl\u00ed nobles, quitted M\u00e1liwa in order to resume the reins of his own government. Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n shortly afterwards assumed royalty and divided his kingdom into estates among his officers whom he ennobled. Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n on assuming independence, took up his residence in Dh\u00e1r, which place he considered as the seat of\nhis government, but he frequently visited the city of M\u00e1nd\u00f3, remaining there sometimes for months together. He only survived his assumption of the royal titles a few years; for in the year 1405 A.D., 808 A.H., he died suddenly, and his son Alp Kh\u00e1n ascended the throne under the title of Sult\u00e1n H\u00f3shang Sh\u00e1h. Including Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n eleven princes reigned in M\u00e1liwa till the time of the emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, whose son Akbar eventually subdued and attached it to the Dehl\u00ed government.

After the conquest of that country, he joined 'Alamg\u00edr and received the title of Diler Kh\u00e1n and the mansab of 7000. He died in the reign of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h in the Dakhan, where he held a j\u00e1gir.\n\nDilras Bano Begam, daughter of Shahnaw\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n Safv\u00ed, the son of Mirz\u00e1 Rustam Kan-dhari, and wife of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr. She had another sister who was married to Mur\u00e1d Bekh\u00e1h, brother of 'Alamg\u00edr.\n\nDilshad Khatun, daughter of Amir Dami-shk, the son of Amir Juban or Jovian, and wife of Sultan Abu Sa'id Kh\u00e1n. Amir Hasan Buzurg, who after the death of the Sultan in 1335 A.D., took possession of Baghdad, married her, but the reins of government were in her hands.\n\nDilsoz, poetical title of Khair\u00e1t\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, a poet who lived about the year 1800.\n\nDost 'Ali, Naw\u00e1b of Arkat and a relative of Murtaza Kh\u00e1n. Under him the atrocious seizure of Trichinopoly was perpetrated by Chanda Sahib. He was succeeded by his son Safdar 'Ali, who, after overcoming the effects of poison prepared for him by Murtaza Kh\u00e1n, fell by the poniard of a Path\u00e1n assassin, hired for the work by the same person. A storm was raised which he had not the courage to encounter; and disguising himself in female attire, he escaped from Arkat to his own fort of Vellors.\n\nDost Muhammad Khan, ruler of Kabul and Kandah\u00e1r, was one of the brothers of Fath\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, the celebrated waz\u00edr of Mahm\u00fad, ruler of Hirat and chief of the Barakz\u00e1i clan. He was the most powerful chief in Afghanistan, and had for some years previous to the restoration of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1s-ul-Mulk by the British in 1838, ruled that country. On the death of this prince, Dost Muhammad again assumed the reins of government.\n\nOn the base and cruel murder of Fath\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n by Mahm\u00fad at the instigation of Prince Kamr\u00e1n, his brothers revolted from their allegiance under the guidance of 'Azm Kh\u00e1n, the governor of Kashmir, and drove Mahm\u00fad and his son Kamr\u00e1n from Kabul. Azim Kh\u00e1n in the first instance offered the vacant throne to Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1s, but offended by some personal slight, withdrew his support, and placed in his room, Aiy\u00fab, a brother of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1s, who was content to take the trappings with the position of royalty. On Azim Kh\u00e1n's death, his brothers dissatisfied with their position conspired against his son, Hab\u00edb-ull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n, and seizing his person, by threats of blowing him from a gun, induced his mother to deliver up the residue of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1s's immense wealth. Aiy\u00fab's son was killed in these disputes, and he himself, alarmed by these scenes of violence, fled to Lahor. Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, the most talented of the brothers, then took possession of the throne and became de facto king of Kabul. Sher Dil Kh\u00e1n, accompanied by four brothers, carried off about half a million sterling of Azim Kh\u00e1n's money, and seated himself in Kandah\u00e1r as an independent chieftain. He and one of his brothers died some years ago; and Kandah\u00e1r was until lately ruled by Koh\u00e1n Dil Kh\u00e1n, assisted by his two surviving brothers Rah\u00edm Dil and Mir Dil.

He was subsequently sent down to Calcutta, where he arrived, accompanied by one of his sons, on the 23rd May, 1841.

His violence, rapacity and lawless ambition, were the main causes of the war in 1802 with the confederate Marhatta chieftains. Hostilities having broken out with the British, Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards Duke of Wellington) defeated Doulat Rao at Assaye in 1803, while Lord Lake drove the Marhattas from the whole of the Doab.

His father died in 1790 A.D., at which time he was only seven years of age. He inherited from his grandfather Rup Rao the Chaklas of Kora, Fatehpur and Kara, but was dispossessed by the Nawab Wazir, and a Nankar allowance of 24,000 rupees granted to the raja on his exclusion. This was subsequently reduced to 7,500 rupees. The original grant amounted to 52,000 per annum, payable from 14 mahals, but in 1770 A.D., the Nawab Najaf Khan acquiring unlimited dominion over these provinces, dispossessed his father of eleven of the villages, by which his income was reduced to 20,000 rupees. In 1787 his father was dispossessed of the remaining three villages by Zainul Abidin Khan, the 'Amil, but as the raja was about to proceed to hostilities, the 'Amil agreed to allow him 10,000 Rs. for the first year, and 20,000 thereafter, but failed in the fulfilment of his promise. In 1792 A.D., Zainul Abidin died, and was succeeded by his son Bakar Ali Khan, and from that period up to 1802, the raja Dunyapat Singh was allowed 8,000 rupees per annum, which was confirmed by Government in 1806 in perpetuity.\n\nDupleix, a French officer, governor of Pondicherry.

Overtures had been made for an union with Dalpat Sah, raja of Singalgurh (which is situated on the brow of a hill that commands a pass on the road about half way between Garha and Sangar;) but the proposal was rejected on the ground of a previous engagement, and some inferiority of caste on the part of the Garha family, who was of the race of the Chandeli Rajputs. Dalpat Sah was a man of uncommonly fine appearance, and this added to the celebrity of his father's name and extent of his dominions, made Durgawati as desirous as himself for the union, but he was by her given to understand, that she must be relinquished or taken by force, since the difference of caste would of itself be otherwise an insurmountable obstacle. He marched with all his troops he could assemble, met those of her father and his rival,\u2014gained a victory and brought off Durgawati as the prize to the fort of Singalgurh. Dalpat Sah died four years after their marriage, leaving a son named Bir Narayan; about three years of age, and his widow as regent during his minority. Asaf Khan, the imperial envoy at Kara, Manikpur on the Ganges in the province of Allahabad, invited by the prospect of appropriating so fine a country and so much wealth as she was reputed to possess, invaded her dominions in the year 1664 A.D., at the head of 6,000 cavalry and 12,000 well disciplined infantry, with a train of artillery. He was met by the queen at the head of her troops, and an action took place in which she was defeated. She received a wound from an arrow in the eye; and her only son, then about 18 years of age, was severely wounded and taken to the rear. At this moment she received another arrow in the neck; and seeing her troops give way and the enemy closing around her, she snatched a dagger from the driver of her elephant, and plunged it in her own bosom. Her son was taken off the field, and was, unperceived by the enemy, conveyed back to the palace at Churagarh, to which Asaf Khan returned immediately after his victory and laid siege. The young prince was killed in the siege; and the women set fire to the place under the apprehension of suffering dishonor if they fell alive into the hands of the enemy. Two females are said to have escaped, the sister of the queen, and a young princess who had been betrothed to the young prince Bir Narayan; and these two are said to have been sent to the emperor Akbar. In this district of Jabbalpur, the marble rocks and the palace called Madan Mahal is worth seeing. There is some doggeral rhyme about this palace which is not generally known, though of some interest. This building stands on a single granite boulder, and was constructed by the Gond princess Rani Durgawati, at the time of the Muhammadan invasion of Central India. Years after the cession of the country to the British, a wag of a Pandit wrote on the entrance door of the palace the following lines:\n\nMadan Mahal ke chhain me,\nDo tangan ke bich,\nGuja nau lakh rupi,\nAur soni ke do int.\n\nTranslation\u2014\n\nIn the shade of Madan Mahal\nBetween two boulders\nThere are buried nine lakhs of rupees\nAnd two bricks of gold.\n\nIt did not take long for the news of the appearance of this writing on the door to spread abroad, and the very person to fall a dupe to the Pandit's trick was Captain Wheatley, at that time a Political Assistant at Jabalpur. He mustered some peons and laborers, and having proceeded to the spot, commenced digging for the treasure on the part of Government. The native lady, in whose possession was the village lands on which the palace stood, came rushing down to the Agent to the Governor-General and represented that she was being plundered of her\ntreasure by Captain Wheatley. \"Pagli,\" replied Sir Wm. Sleeman, \"he is as mad as you are; the Pandit would not have divulged the secret were it of much value.\" Many years have since elapsed, and many others not possessed of Sir William's wisdom have fallen dupes to the Pandit's poetical trick; and, but for the very durable nature of the martas, there have been enough of excavations made in and about the building to raze it to the ground.\n\nE.\n\nEgypt, kings of, vide Moizz-li-din-allah Abi Tamim Ma'd.\n\nEkkoji, the founder of the Tanjore family was the son of Shahji Bhosla, and brother of Sciwaj, but from another consort.

He had escaped, it is said in a miraculous manner, from Zoh\u00e1k, when that prince had seized and murdered his father. At the age of 16 he joined K\u00e1wa or G\u00e1wa, a blacksmith, who had collected a large body of his countrymen: these fought with enthusiasm under the standard of the blacksmith's apron, which was afterwards converted into the royal standard of Persia, called the Durash\u00e1 K\u00e1wan\u00ed. Zoh\u00e1k, after numerous defeats, was made prisoner, and put to a slow and painful death. Farid\u00fan, who was a very just and virtuous king, had three sons, viz.: Salm, T\u00fcr, and Erij, among whom he divided his kingdom; but the two elder, displeased that Persia, the fairest of lands and the seat of royalty, should have been given to Erij their junior, combined to effect his ruin, and at last slew him, and sent his head to Farid\u00fan. The old man fainted at the sight, and when he recovered, he called upon Heaven to punish the base perpetrators of so unnatural and cruel a deed. The daughter of Erij was married to the nephew of Farid\u00fan, and their young son Man\u00fach\u00e9hr proved the image of his grandfather. When he attained manhood, the old king made every preparation to enable him to revenge the blood of Erij. A war commenced; and in the first battle Salm and T\u00fcr were both slain.

His father was killed in the battle fought against Jahandar Shah his uncle and predecessor. One of Jahandar Shah's first acts on his accession to the throne had been to put all the princes of the blood within his reach, to death; among those whom he could not get into his power, was Farrukh-siyar, who was in Bengal at the time of his grandfather Bahadur Shah's death. But when the information of his father's death reached him, he threw himself on the compassion and fidelity of Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan, the governor of Behar, who warmly espoused his cause, and prevailed on his brother, Sayyid Abdullah Khan, governor of Allahabad, to adopt the same course. By the aid of these noblemen, Farrukh-siyar assembled an army at Allahabad, marched towards Agra, defeated Jahandar Shah, took him prisoner, and having murdered him, he ascended the throne in the fort of Delhi on Friday, the 9th of January, 1713, O.S., 23rd Zil-hijjah, 1124 A.H. The former Amir-ul-Umra Zulfiqar Khan and many other nobles and dependants of the late emperor were put to death by the bow-string and other punishments. Rajee Subbchand, Diwan to the late Amir-ul-Umra, had his tongue cut out; Aziz-uddin, son of Jahandar Shah, Ali Tabar, the son of Azim Shah, and Humayun Bakhsh, younger brother to Farrukh-siyar were deprived of their sight by a red hot iron drawn over their eyes. On Farrukh-siyar's accession, Abdullah Khan, the eldest brother, was made Wazir or minister of Kutub-ul-Mulk, and Husain Ali Khan raised to the rank of Amir-ul-Umra (Commander-in-Chief) which was the second in the State. His nuptials with the daughter of Rajee Ajit Singh of Marwar, were celebrated with unprecedented splendour in the year 1716 A.D., 1128 A.H. Farrukh-siyar had not long enjoyed the throne, when a jealousy arose between him and the Wazir Kutub-ul-Mulk. And on the emperor's trying to form schemes for the recovery of his independence, he was deposed, blinded and imprisoned by the two brothers. This event took place on the 18th February, 1719, O.S., 8th Rab'i II, 1131 A.H., and not long after he was murdered on the 16th May, A.D., 9th Rajab, 1131 A.H., following, and buried in the court of the mausoleum of the emperor Humayun at Delhi. He reigned 6 years 3 months and 15 days. After his deposition the Saiyads set up a prince of the blood to whom they gave the title of Rafiq-ul-Darajat.

After him Mohammad Sh\u00e1h, the son of Abb\u00e1s Mirz\u00e1, and grandson of Fatha 'Ali Sh\u00e1h, mounted the throne and died in 1847 A.D., when his son Nasir-udd\u00edn Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, the present king, succeeded him. It was to the court of Fatha 'Ali Sh\u00e1h that Sir John Malcolm in 1800 led the magnificent embassy which Lord Wellesley had despatched from Calcutta, with the view of trumping Bonaparte's cards in the East, and of playing off a Persian ally on our Indian frontiers against an Afgh\u00e1n ill-wisher, the ambitious Zam\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h.\n\nFatha Haidar, the oldest son of Tipp\u00fa Sult\u00e1n.\n\nFatha-puri Mahal, or Begam, one of the wives of the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.

After his father's death in 1628 A.D., 1035 A.H., he succeeded to his authority; but Murtaza Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h II, being weary of his control, took him prisoner by treachery, and confined him in the fort of Khybar. Having made his escape, he rebelled, but was again taken, and confined in Daulatab\u00e1d. He was released in time, and appointed generalissimo by the influence of his sister, mother to Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. He shortly, to prevent another removal from office, confined the Sultan under pretence of insanity, and put to death twenty-five of the principal nobility in one day, writing to the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, that he had thus acted, to prevent them from rebelling against him. The emperor in reply commended his attachment and ordered him to put the captive prince to death, which he did about the year 1628 A.D., 1038 A.H., and placed his son Husain, an infant of ten years, on the throne. Fatha Kh\u00e1n, by offering a present of eight lacs of rupees, and agreeing to pay tribute, was allowed to keep his territory, yet remained to the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi sovereignty. In the year 1634 A.D., 1044 A.H., Fatha Kh\u00e1n was forced to surrender; and the fall of this place put a final period to the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi dynasty, which had swayed the sceptre for 150 years. Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h was confined for life in the fortress of Gwalior, but Fatha Kh\u00e1n was received into favour, and allowed to retire to L\u00e1hor on a pension of two lacs of rupees, which he enjoyed till his death.\n\nFatha Naek, the father of Haidar 'Ali Kh\u00e1n, the usurper of Mysore and Sr\u00edngapatam.

After the death of that king, he left Dakh\u00e1n and came to Dehl\u00ed in the year 1582 A.D., 990 A.H., and had an honorable office assigned to him by the emperor Akbar, near his person, with the title of Azd-ud-daula.

The king was much grieved at his loss; and Sheikh Fa\u00edz\u00ed wrote an appropriate epitaph on the occasion.

It contains the annales of the ancient kings of Persia, from the reign of the first king, K\u00e1imurs, to the death of Yaz\u00eddj\u00e1rd III, the last monarch of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan race, who was deprived of his kingdom 641 A.D., by the invasion of the Arabs during the Khil\u00e1fs\u00e1t of Umar, the second Kh\u00e1lif after Muhammed. It is the labour of 30 years, and consists of 60,000 verses, each of which is a distich. The following circumstances respecting the origin of the poem and the life of the poet, are chiefly derived from the preface to the copy of the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, which was collated 1426 A.D., 829 A.H., by order of B\u00e1isanghur Mirz\u00e1 the grandson of Amir Taim\u00far. It appears from that preface, that Yaz\u00eddj\u00e1rd, the last king of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan race, took considerable pains in collecting all the chronicles, histories, and traditions connected with Persia and the sovereigns of that country, from the time of K\u00e1imurs to the accession of the Khusros, which by his direction were digested and brought into one view, and formed the book known by the name of \"Siar-ul-Maluk,\" or the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma. When the followers of Muhammed overturned the Persian monarchy, this work was found in the plundered library of Yaz\u00eddj\u00e1rd. In the tenth century one of the kings of the S\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00edan dynasty, directed Dak\u00edki the poet to verify that extensive work, but the poet only lived to finish a thousand distichs, having been assassinated by his own slave. Nothing further was done till the reign of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad, when a romantic accident furnished the Sultan with a copy of the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma, the existence of which was till then unknown to him. From this work, he selected seven stories which he delivered to seven poets to be composed in verse, that he might be able to ascertain the merits of each competitor. The poet Unsar\u00ed gained the palm, and he was accordingly engaged to arrange the whole in verse. Firdausi was at this time at Tus, his native city, where he cultivated his poetical talents with assiduity and success. He had heard of the attempt of Dak\u00edki, and of the determination of the reigning king Mahm\u00fad, to patronize an undertaking which\npromised to add lustre to the age in which he lived. Having fortunately succeeded in procuring a copy of the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma, he pursued his studies with unremitting zeal, and soon produced that part of the poem in which the battles of Zuh\u00e1k and Farz\u00edd\u00fan are described. The performance was universally read and admired, and it was not long before his fame reached the ears of the Sultan who immediately invited him to his court. It is related that when Firdausi, on the invitation of the Sultan, reached the capital of Ghazni, he happened to pass a public garden where the three royal poets, Unaid, Asj\u00e1d\u00ed, and Farrukh\u00ed, were enjoying themselves. The poets observed him approach, and at once agreed that if the stranger claimed to have any taste for poetry, which they intended to put to test, he should be admitted to their friendship, and in order to decide as to his merits they settled among themselves to repeat each in his turn a hemistich, and leave to Firdausi to complete the fourth, but at the same time satisfied in their own minds, that there was no other word in the Persian language that would rhyme with the three, which they had taken care to pre-occupy. Firdausi joining them and hearing the proposal, promised to exert his powers. They then commenced each with an extemporaneous hemistich:\n\nUnsari ...... The light of the moon to thy splendour is weak,\nAsj\u00e1d\u00ed ...... The rose is eclipsed by the bloom of thy cheek;\nFarrukh\u00ed .... Thy eye-lashes dart through the folds of the Joshan,\nFirdausi .... Like the javelin of Geo in the battle with Pushan.\n\nThe poets were astonished at the readiness of the stranger, and ashamed at being totally ignorant of the story of Geo and Pushan, which Firdausi related as described in the B\u00e1st\u00e1n N\u00e1ma. They immediately treated him with the greatest kindness and respect, and afterwards introduced him to Mahmud, as a poet capable of undertaking the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma. Mahmud considered himself never so much honored as when Firdausi set his foot at Ghazni; he was never more proud, than that Firdausi was by his command, composing, in his faultless verse, a history of the monarchs of Persia, his predecessors. No reward then appeared to him too great to offer, to induce the poet to undertake such a task, no promises too splendid to excite him. \"Write unequalled one,\" cried he, \"and for every thousand complets a thousand pieces of gold shall be thine.\" Firdausi obeyed, but resolved to accept no reward till he had completed the work he had undertaken, and for thirty years he studied and laboured that his poem might be worthy of eternal fame. In this he succeeded, and presented an elegant copy of his book to Mahmud, but the patience of the Sultan was exhausted, his enthusiasm was gone, his liberality had faded away, and when the 60,000 complets of the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma was ended, there was a pause, which brought to the poet disappointment, and to the monarch such everlasting disgrace as has obliterated all his triumphs. Mahmud received the book, coldly applauded his diligence and dismissed him. Many months elapsed, and Firdausi heard no more of his work; he then took occasion to remind the king of it by the following epigram:\n\n'Tis said our monarch's liberal mind,\nIs like the ocean unconfined,\nHappy are they who prove it so,\n'Tis not for me that truth to know.\nI've plunged within its waves, 'tis true,\nBut not a single pearl could view.\n\nShamed, piqued, and offended at this freedom, the Sultan ordered 60,000 pieces of silver dirhams to be sent to the author, instead of the gold which he had promised. Firdausi was in the bath at the time the money arrived, and his rage and amazement exceeded all bounds when he found himself thus insulted. He immediately distributed the paltry sum amongst the attendants of the bath and the slave who brought it. The excited poet then relieved his mind by a satire full of stinging invective, and caused it to be transmitted to the favorite Wazir who had instigated the Sultan against him; it was carefully sealed up, with directions that it should be read to Mahmud on some occasion when his mind was perturbed with affairs of State, as it was a poem likely to afford him entertainment. Firdausi having thus prepared for vengeance, quitted the court, and was safely arrived in Mazandar\u00e1n, where news reached him that his lines had fully answered the purpose he had intended they should do. Mahmud had heard and trembled, and too late discovered that he had ruined his own reputation for ever. After his satire had been read by Mahmud, the poet feared to remain too long in one place: he sought shelter in the court of the Khalif of Bagdad, in whose honor he added a 1000 complets to the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, and who rewarded him with 60,000 gold dinars which had been withheld by Mahmud. Mahmud pretended to have discovered that his Wazir had deceived him in attributing impiety to Firdausi, and he at once sacrificed that favorite, dismissing him with disgrace. Thinking, by a tardy act of liberality, to repair his former meanness, Mahmud dispatched to Firdausi the 60,000 pieces he had promised, a robe of State, and many apologies and expressions of friendship; but the poet was dead, having expired in his native town full of years and honours, surrounded by his friends and kindred. Firdausi died at T\u00faz (now called Mashhad) his native country in 1020 A.D., 411 A.H., aged 89 years; but Haji Khalf\u00e1 says, he died in 1025 A.D., 416 A.H. Besides the Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma, he is the author of other poems called \"Abi\u00e1t Firdausi.\"\n\nFirdausi-al-Tha\u00fail, \u0641\u0631\u062f\u0648\u0633\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u067e\u0647\u0644\u0648\u06cc, a Turkish historian, and author of the Turkish work called \"Sh\u00e1hn\u00e1ma\" which comprises the history of all the ancient kings of the East. Bayazid or Bajazet II, to whom the book was dedicated, ordered the author to reduce it from its original bulk of 300 volumes to 80. Firdausi, however, felt so mortified at this proposal, that he preferred leaving the country altogether, and emigrated to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, in Persia.

His father, a learned man, by name Ghul\u00e1m 'Adil Hind\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, left his native country when our author was very young and travelled into India. He eventually reached Ahmadnagar in the Deccan during the reign of Murtaz\u00e1 Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h I, and was appointed by the Sultan to instruct his son Mir\u00e1n Husain, in the Persian language. He soon died after his selection, and Fir\u00edsha was left an orphan in early youth. After the death of Murtaz\u00e1 Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h in 1589 A.D., 996 A.H., he proceeded to Bij\u00e1ipur, and was presented by D\u00edl\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, minister to D\u00edsh\u00edm 'Adil Sh\u00e1h II, by whose request he wrote the history which goes by his name, in the year 1023 Hijri (1614 A.D.). The year of his death is altogether unknown. Briggs supposes that it occurred in 1612 A.D., 1021 A.H., making him only 41 years of age. M.J. Mohl supposes him to have revised his work up to at least 1623 A.D., 1033 A.H., making his age not less than 73, as he supposes him to have been born in 1550 A.D. Fir\u00edsha styles his work, \"Gul\u00e1h-i-Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u00ed,\" and \"Nauras N\u00e1ma.\" Its former name is derived from the king to whom it was dedicated; and hence it is frequently quoted under the name of \"T\u00e1rikh Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u00ed.\" The latter name was given to it in commemoration of the new capital, Nauras, which his patron Ibrahim 'Adil Sh\u00e1h, commenced building in the year 1599 A.D.

'Al\u00e1-uddin hearing of the king's departure from Dehl\u00ed, crossed the Ganges and encamped near M\u00e1n\u00edkpur upon the opposite bank. When the king reached the landing place, 'Al\u00e1-uddin appeared upon the bank with his attendants, whom he ordered to halt. He advanced alone, met his uncle and fell prostrate at his feet. The king taking him by the hand, was leaving him to the mercy of others when 'Al\u00e1-uddin made a signal to his guards, and one of his officers struck his head off. 'Al\u00e1-uddin caused it to be fixed on the point of a spear and carried through the camp and city. This circumstance took place on the 19th of July 1296 A.D., 17th Ram\u00e1zan, 695 A.H., and 'Al\u00e1-uddin ascended the throne of Dehl\u00ed with the title of Sikandar S\u00e1n\u00ed.

In August, 1387 A.D., he abdicated the throne and resigned the reins of government to his son N\u00e1sir-udd\u00edn Muhammad, but the prince giving himself up entirely to pleasure, was soon after expelled and obliged to fly with a small retinue to the mountains of Sirmour, and Firoz Sh\u00e1h again resumed his full authority.

The Jats are a stalwart and brave race, and showed what they could do under his leadership, but when left to themselves they are so divided by factions, that Hurriana has always fallen an easy prey to every adventurer who has taken it into his head to subdue it. Thus it was overrun by the Marhattas, under Mons. Louis and Perron, by the Rohillas under Amir Khan, and another leader, and finally by the British. George Thomas came out to India as a common seaman, and having deserted his ship, first took service with Matto Rao Scindia about the year 1774 A.D. The famous Begum of Sirhind was then in the smith of her power, and he left Scindia to serve her, and shortly after, having collected a body of men, he left her, and marched down to Hurriana, and in no time carved out a kingdom for himself. He made the city of Hansi his capital and built a strong fort in it. He built another fort about 20 miles to the south of the town of Rohtak, and called it after his own Christian name Georgegarh, or as the natives call Jahajgarh. After a few years the Marhattas under Mons. Louis invaded his territories. He hastened to give them battle, and throwing himself into the small fort of Jahajgarh, he fought them for three days, though his force was infinitely smaller than theirs.

He was fortunate enough to secure the esteem of Amir Taimur, who sought every occasion to do him service. After the death of that tyrant, he attended the court of his son Shahrukh Mirza, and received from the young prince Mirza Baisanghar every demonstration of kindness and regard. To him he dedicated his works under the name of \"Zubdatut-Tawarikh Baisangham,\" which contains a complete history of the world, and an account of the institutions and religions of different people down to 1425 A.D., 829 A.H.

He was born at Shiraz in the reign of the Muzaffarians, and was living at the time when Amir Taimur (Tamerlane) defeated Shah Mansur the last Sultan of that dynasty. The language of Hafiz has been styled among the Musalmans, \"Lisannul-Ghaib,\" the language of mystery. From his frequent celebration of love and wine in his odes he has not improperly been denominated, by some Orientalists, the Anacreon of Persia. He died in 1389 A.D., 971 A.H. at Shiraz, where his tomb is yet to be seen at a place called Mussalla, and is visited as a sacred spot by pilgrims of all ages. After his death a collection of 569 of his odes was made by Sayyad Kasim Anwar, entitled \"Diwan Hafiz.\" A few of his poems may be understood in a literal sense; but in general they are figurative, and allude to the Sufi doctrines; most of them have been at different times translated into some of the European languages. At the head of the English translators stand Sir W. Jones, Messrs. Richardson and Carle. There have been two other Persian poets of the name of Hafiz, one of them surnamed Halwai, that is to say, the confectioner, who lived in the reign of Sultan Shahrukh, the son of Tamerlane, and the other was named Ajin Rumi. Many zealous admirers of Hafiz insist, that by wine he invariably means devotion; and they have gone so far as to compose a dictionary of words in the language, as they call it, of the Sufis; in that vocabulary, sleep is explained by meditation on the divine perfections, and perfume by hope of the divine favor; gales are illiques of grace; kisses and embraces, the raptures of piety; idolaters, infidels, and libertines, are men of the purest religion, and their idol is the Creator himself; the tavern is a retired oratory, and its keeper, a sage instructor; beauty denotes the perfection of the Supreme Being; treasurers are the expansion of his glory; lips the hidden mysteries of his essence; down on the cheek, the world of spirits, who encircle his throne; and a black mole, the point of indivisible unity; lastly, wantonness, mirth, and incredibility, mean religious ardour and abstraction from all terrestrial thoughts.\n\nHafiz Muhammad, author of the \"Hawi Saghir.\"\n\nHafiz Rahmat Khan, \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0646, a celebrated Rohila chief.

He failed in his engagement to pay forty lacs of rupees to Nawab Shujauddaula of Audh for the protection of his country from the ravages of the Marhattas, was killed in a battle fought by the nawab by the assistance of the English on the 23rd April, 1774 A.D., 10th Safar, 1188 A.H.

Printed at Calcutta in 1871.\n\nHammad, \u062d\u0645\u0627\u062f, the son of Abu Hanifa, who was a learned man, and died in the year 792 A.D., 176 A.H.\n\nHamza, Amir, \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0645, the son of Abdul Muttalib, and uncle of Muhammad, who gave him the title of Asad-ullah, or the lion of God, because of his courage and valour, and put into his hands the first standard he ordered to be made, which was called \"Rasul-ul-Islam,\" the standard of the faith. Hamza, who was also called Abu 'Umar, was killed in the battle of Ohad which Muhammad fought with the Kureishites, of whom Abu Sufian was the chief. After the battle, Hind, the wife of Abu Sufian, pulled out Hamza's liver out of his body and chewed and swallowed some of it. This battle took place in the month of March, 626 A.D., Shawwal, 3 A.H.\n\nHamza Bano Begum, \u062d\u0645\u0632\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0648 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0645, daughter of Shah Jahangir Kandahari Begum, daughter of Muzaffar Husain Mirza of the royal race of Shah Isma'il Safwi. She was born in the year 1019 A.H.\n\nHamza Mirza, \u062d\u0645\u0632\u0629 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627, the eldest son of Sultan Muhammad Khuda Banda, and the grandson of Shah Tahmasp I of the Safwi family of Persia. His father, on account of a natural weakness in his eyes, which rendered him almost blind, had at first entrusted the charge of the empire to his wazir, Mirza Sulaiman; when that nobleman was slain, he created his own son, Hamza Mirza, regent of the empire. This prince, by his valour, extricated his weak father from all the difficulties with which he was surrounded. But this gleam of good fortune soon vanished. This gallant prince was stabbed by a barber, in his own private apartments on the 24th of November, 1586 A.D., 22nd Zil-hijja 994 A.H.\n\nHanbal, Imam, \u0647\u0646\u0628\u0644, or Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, the son of Mohammad-Ibn-Hanbal, was the fourth Imam or founder of one of the four orthodox sects of the Sunnis called Hanbalites. This sect made a great noise in Baghdad in the reign of the Khalif Al-Mukhtadir in 929 A.D., 317 A.H., Merouzi chief of the sect, had asserted that God had placed Mohammad on his throne, which assertion he founded upon the passage of the Koran: \"Thy Lord shall soon give thee a considerable place or station.\" All the other sects of the Musalmans regard the exposition of the Hanbalites as a shocking impiety. They maintain that this 'considerable place or station,' was the post or quality of a mediator, which they affirm to belong to their prophet. This dispute passed from the schools to the public assemblies. At length they came from words to blows which cost the lives of several thousands. In the year 935 A.D., 323 A.H., the Hanbalites became so insolent, that they marched in arms on the city of Baghdad, and plundered the shops on pretence that wine was drunk in them. Ahmad was a traditionist of the first class, and composed a collection of authenticated traditions called \"Masnad\" more copious than those any other person had till then been able to form: it is said that he knew by-heart one million of those traditions. He was born in the year 780 A.D., 164 A.H., and died on the 31st July, 855 A.D., 12th Rab'i I, 241 A.H., in the reign of the Khalif Al-Mutawakkil, and was buried at Baghdad. It was estimated that the number of men present at his funeral was 800,000, and women 60,000; and it is said that 20,000 Christians, Jews and Magians became Musalmans on the day of his death. In the year 835 A.D., Ramazan, 220 A.H., some time in the month of September, he was required by the Khalif Al-Motassim Billah to declare that the Koran was created, but would not, and although beaten and imprisoned, persisted in his refusal. The eternity of the Koran, considered as the word of God, is the orthodox Muslem doctrine.\n\nHandal Mirza, \u0647\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627, son of the emperor Babar Shah, and brother of Humayun, was born in the year 1518 A.D., 924 A.H. He lost his life in a night attack made by his brother Kamaran Mirza on the emperor Humayun near Khaibar in the province of Kabul, on the 19th of November, 1561 A.D., 21st Zi-Ka'da, 958 A.H. He is buried at Kabul close to the tomb of the emperor Babar Shah. Humayun, out of affection to the memory of Handal Mirza, in the same year, gave the daughter of that prince, Raza Sultan, to his son Akbar in marriage.\n\nHani, \u062d\u0646\u06cc, surname of Muhammad-bin-'Ali, a poet who died in the year 1338 A.D., 733 A.H.\n\nHanifa Imam, \u0647\u0646\u0641\u06cc \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645, also called Abu Hanifa and Imam 'Asim, was one of the four Jurists-consults of Mecca; viz., Imam Hanifa, Imam Hanbal, Imam Shafi'i and Imam Malik, from whose works are derived the various Codes of Muhammadan Jurisprudence. He was one of the most celebrated doctors of the Musalmans, and chief of the sect of Hanifites; and though his sect is the principal of the four which they now indifferently follow, he was ill-used during his lifetime, and died in the prison, Bagdad 767 A.D., 150 A.H. His principal works are, the \"Musnad,\" i.e., the foundation or support, wherein he established all the points of the Musalm\u00e1n faith: a Treatise entitled \"Filakl\u00e1m,\" or Scholastic Divinity; and a Catechism called \"Musallim-ul-Islam\" i.e., the Instructor.\n\nHis principal work is entitled the \"Fiqh-ul-Akbar,\" it treats of the Ilm-ul-Kalam, and has been commented upon by various writers, many of whom are mentioned by H\u00e1j\u00ed Khalf\u00e1. Vide Abu Hanifa. Some say that the Musnad was written by Imam Hanbal. By the Shias he is as much detested and censured, as by their antagonists he is admired and exalted. For allowing his disciples to drink nabe, which is a wine made of dates, he is accused by the Persians of departing from the clear injunction of the Prophet against all intoxicating beverages.\n\nHarindar Narain Bhup, Maharaja, \u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0646 \u0628\u06be\u067e, the raja of Kuch Behar, who died at Benares on the 30th May, 1839, aged 70 years. He was of the Rajbansi caste, and a follower of Siva, but his style of living was very unlike that of a Hind\u00fa. He used to marry without any regard to caste, and entered into the connubial relation with any woman he took a fancy to. He did not even spare married women. The number of his wives or r\u00e1n\u00eds was no less than 1200!\nHari Rao Holkar, the raja of Indor, was the cousin and successor of Mah\u0101r\u0101o III, the adopted son and successor of Jaswant R\u0101o Holkar. He died on the 24th of October, 1843 A.D.\n\nHariri, whose full name is Ab\u016b Muhammad Kasim-bin-'All-bin-'Usm\u0101n-al-Har\u012br\u012b-al-Basr\u012b, was a native of Basra. He was one of the ablest writers of his time, and is the author of the \"Muk\u0101mat Hariri,\" a work consisting of 50 Oratorical, Poetical, Moral, Ecomastic, and Satirical discourses, supposed to have been spoken or read in public assemblies; but which were composed by the author at the desire of An\u1e63h\u0113w\u0101n-ibn-Khal\u012bd, waz\u012br to Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Mu\u1e25ammad Salj\u016bk\u012b. He died at Basra in the year 1122 A.D., 516 A.H. Poets, historians, grammarians, and lexicographers look upon the Muk\u0101mat as the highest authority, and next to the Kur\u0101n, as far at least as language is concerned. His book has been translated either entirely or partially into nearly every Eastern and European tongue.\n\nHarkaran, the son of Mathura D\u0101s, a Kamb\u014dh of Multan, was a Munsh\u012b in the service of Naw\u0101b Ya'q\u016bb Kh\u0101n, and is the author of a collection of letters called \"Insh\u0101' Harkaran,\" or the Forms of Harkaran, translated into English by Dr. Francis Balfour, M.D. The second edition of this work was printed in England in 1804.\n\nHarun-al-Rashid, \u1e24asan bin Sahl, was governor of Chaldees about the year 830 A.D., under the Khalif Al-M\u0101'm\u016bn, who married T\u016br\u0101n Dukht his daughter. Some attribute to this \u1e24asan the translation of the Persian book entitled \"Jawed\u0101n Khirad\" into Arabic.\n\n\u1e24asan, \u1e24asan, poetical name of Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e24asan who flourished in the reign of the emperor Sh\u0101h 'Alam of Delhi.\n\n\u1e24asan Ab\u1e0d\u0101l, \u1e24asan bin Sahl, or Baba \u1e24asan Ab\u1e0d\u0101l, a famous saint who was a Sayyad at Sabzw\u0101r in Khur\u0101s\u0101n. He came to India with Mirz\u0101 Shahrukh, son of Ans\u0101r Taim\u016br, and died at Kandah\u0101r where his tomb is resorted to by pilgrims. Jah\u0101ng\u012br says in the T\u016bzak that the place Hurasadak is 75 kos from Kashmir.\n\n\u1e24asan 'Ali, \u1e24asan bin Ali, the poet laureate in the service of Tipu Sultan of Mysore. He is the author of a book called \"Bhogbal\" or the \"Kok Sh\u0101star.\" It is a curious but obscene satire on women, said to be a translation or paraphrase from the Sanskrit in Hindi verse. There is another translation of the same book in Persian prose called \"Lazzat-un-Nisa,\" by Ziy\u0101-ud-d\u012bn Nakhshab\u012b.\n\n\u1e24asan Ask\u0101r\u012b, \u1e24asan bin Ali, or Ab\u016b'l \u1e24asan 'Ali-al-'Ask\u0101r\u012b, was the eleventh Im\u0101m of the race of 'Al\u012b, and the eldest son of Im\u0101m 'Al\u012b N\u0101q\u012b who was the tenth. He was born at Mad\u012bnah in the year 846 A.D., 252 A.H., and died on the 6th November 874 A.D., 22nd Mu\u1e25arram, 261 A.H., aged 28 years.

He was born in 642 A.D., 21 A.H., and died on the 11th October, 728 A.D., 1st Rajab, 110 A.H., aged 89 lunar years, and was buried at Basra.\n\n\u1e24asan Beg, (Khani, Badakhshi), \u1e24asan, Shaikh Umari was a good soldier. He was made a commander of 2500 for his services in Bang\u0101sh, and was put towards the end of Akbar's reign in charge of Kabul, receiving Fort Rohtas in the Panjab as jagir. \u1e24asan Beg, after making a useless attempt to incriminate others, was put into a cow-hide and in this state he was tied to donkeys and carried through the bazar. He died after a few hours from suffocation.

He is the author of a history also called \"Muntakhib-ut-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh,\" besides the one written by Abdul K\u0101dir Badsh\u0101h. He commenced the work before the close of Akbar's reign, and completed it in the fifth year of the emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br, i.e., 1610 A.D., 1019 A.H., in which year, he tells us, he was appointed Diw\u0101n of Patna.\n\n\u1e24asan-bin-Mu\u1e25ammad Shar\u012bf, \u1e24asan bin Mu\u1e25ammad Shar\u012bf, author of the \"Anis-ul-Ushsh\u0101k,\" the lover's companion, containing an explanation of all the metaphors and phrases used by the poets; with numerous quotations from those held in the greatest estimation.

He was an immediate descendant of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Argh\u016bn Kh\u0101n, king of Persia, (whose sister was his mother,) and one of the principal chiefs of the Mughals in the reign of Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Ab\u016b Sa'id. He married Baghd\u0101d Kh\u0101t\u016bn, daughter of Amir Chob\u0101n or Jov\u012b\u0101n, but the prince being deeply enamoured of her charms, Amir \u1e24asan, after the death of her father, was forced to resign his consort to him in 1327 A.D., 728 A.H. A few years after the death of Abu Sa'id, Amir \u1e24asan married his widow D\u012bsh\u0101d Kh\u0101t\u016bn, went to Baghd\u0101d, seized that city, and became the founder of a petty dynasty of princes. His life was passed in contests to establish his authority over the territories of Baghd\u0101d, and he died before this object of his ambition was accomplished, in July 1356 A.D., Rajab, 757 A.H. His son Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Owes Jal\u0101yer was more fortunate; he not only succeeded in completing the conquest his father had commenced, but carried his arms into Aurabh\u0101j\u0101n and Khur\u0101s\u0101n. Sul\u1e6d\u0101n Owes died in October 1374 A.D., 776 A.H., and left his government to his second son Sul\u1e6d\u0101n \u1e24usain Jal\u0101yer. This excellent prince, who is also alike celebrated for his benevolence and love of justice, lost his life in an action in 1382 A.D., 784 A.H., with his brother Ahmad, surnamed \u1e62\u0101li\u1e25, a cruel and unjust ruler, whose enormities compelled his subjects to invite Amir Taim\u016br (Tamerlane) to their relief in 1393 A.D., and almost the whole of the future life of Ahmad passed in an ineffectual struggle with that conqueror. He fled to Egypt for safety, and when, after the death of Taim\u016br, he returned to recover his dominions, he was taken and put to death by Kara Y\u016bsuf, a Turkman chief in 1410 A.D., 813 A.H.\n\n\u1e24asan Im\u0101m, \u1e24asan bin 'Al\u012b, the eldest son of 'Al\u012b, the son of Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101lib, and F\u0101\u1e6dima, the daughter of Mu\u1e25ammad; was born on the 1st March 626 A.D., 15th Ram\u0101d\u0101n, 3 A.H. After the death of his father in January 661 A.D., Ram\u0101d\u0101n, 40 A.H., he succeeded him as second Im\u0101m, and was proclaimed Khal\u012bf by the Arabians, but perceiving the people divided and himself ill-used, he after six months resigned the Khil\u0101fat to Mu'aw\u012bya, who assigned to him about 150,000 pounds a year, besides\nlarge presents. After this Hasan and his brother Hussain retired and lived privately at Madina, where after a few years he died of poison, administered to him by one of his wives, whom Yazid, the son of Mu'awiya suborned to commit that wickedness, on the promise of marrying her afterwards. But instead of a new husband, she was forced to be contented with a good sum of money which Mu'awiya gave her for her pains; for Yazid was not so mad as to trust himself to her embraces. This mournful event took place on the night of the 17th March, 659 or 670 A.D., 7th Safar, 49 A.H. He was buried in Madina at a place called Bakia. Hasan is said to have been in person very like his grandfather Muhammad, who, when he was born, spit in his mouth and named him Hasan. He had twenty children, fifteen sons and five daughters. Though his wives were remarkably fond of him, yet he was apt very frequently to divorce them and marry new ones.\n\nHasan Kashi, \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u0634\u06cc, a poet who was a native of Kashin.

He was one of the chiefs who, during the period of trouble and confusion which took place after the death of Sultan Abu Sa'id, king of Persia, in 1335 A.D., rose to eminence. He fought several battles with Amir Hasan Buzurg, and met his death accidentally by the hands of his quarrelsome wife, in December 1343 A.D., Rajab, 744 A.H.\n\nHasan Maimandi, \u0645\u06cc\u0645\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062d\u0633\u0646, It is recorded by some that he was one of the ministers of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni. This statement is altogether incorrect and unfounded, says Mr. Elliot, as it is not mentioned by any great historian. But his son who is commonly called Ahmad-bin-Hasan Maimandi was a minister of that monarch. Hasan Maimandi was, during the lifetime of Sultan Nasir-uddin Subuktgin, employed as Diwan or Collector of Revenue at Rasba Bust; but Nasir-uddin was led by the secret machinations of his enemies to entertain an unfavourable opinion of him till he was last, in consequence of his having been convicted of extortion and fraud to a large amount, hanged by order of that Sultan; so that the general notion which prevails that he was the wasir of Sultan Mahmud, is erroneous.\n\nHasan Mir, \u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u062d\u0633\u0646, a Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed poet of Lakhnau, and author of the novel called \"Masnav\u00ed Mir Hasan,\" containing the loves of Had\u00ed-i-Munir and Benazir in Urdu verse, which he completed and dedicated to Naw\u00e1b Asaf-uddaula in the year 1785 A.D., 1199 A.H. It is also called \"Sahir-ul-Bay\u00e1n.\" His ancestors were of Hira, but he was born at Duhil and went early in life to Lakhnau, where he was supported by Naw\u00e1b Safdar Jang and his son Mirz\u00e2 Naw\u00e1zshah Ali Khan. He is also the author of a Diwan of about 800 verses, and of a Tazkira of Urdu poets. He died in 1798 A.D., 1204 A.H. His father's name was Mir Ghulam Husain Z\u00e1hi.\n\nHasan Mirza, \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0646, son of Mulla Abdur Razzaq of Lahij\u00e1n. He has left some noble compositions, such as, \"The True Light on the articles of Faith.\" \"The Beauty of good Men in their Works.\" A pious treatise, and some others. He died in the beginning of the 18th century.\n\nHasan, Moulana, \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0646, a learned Musalm\u00e1n who lived in the time of the emperor Jah\u00e1ngir and wrote a chronogram on the sudden death of Sheikh 'Ali Ahmad, son of Sheikh Husain Nakhsh, in the year 1609 A.D., 1018 A.H.\n\nHasan Mutkallim, Moulana, \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0645\u0643\u062a\u0651\u0644\u06cc\u0645, a poet and pupil of Moulana Musaffar of Hirst. He flourished in the reign of Malik Ghay\u00e1s-uddin Kart II, in whose name he composed a book on the art of poetry.\n\nHasan Rafi, \u0631\u0641\u06cc\u0639 \u062d\u0633\u0646, a Persian poet.\n\nHasan Sabah, \u0635\u0628\u062d \u062d\u0633\u0646, the founder of the dynasty of the Isma'ilis in Persia. He was styled Sheikh-ul-Jabal, an Arabic title, which signifies \"the chief of the mountains.\" The name by which this ruler and his descendants are indiscriminately known in European history, is, \"The Old Man of the Mountain.\" His followers or descendants were also called Hasan\u00ed, and the English word \"assassin,\" is supposed to have been formed from a corruption of this form. Hasan Sabb\u00e1h was at first a mace-bearer to Sultan Alp Arsl\u00e1n; but in consequence of a quarrel with Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, the minister of that prince, he retired to Rai, his native country; and from thence to Syria, where he entered into the service of a chief of the family of Isma'il the son of Ja'far S\u00e1d\u00edk, and adopted the tenets of that sect. The first object of Hasan was to possess himself of a stronghold; and he succeeded in gaining by stratagem the mountain fort of Alahm\u00fat, situated between Kazwin and Gil\u00e1n. The fort was built by Hasan-bin-Zaid in the year 860 A.D., 246 A.H., and Hasan Sabb\u00e1h took it in 1089 A.D., 482 A.H. From this fortress he commenced depredations on the surrounding country, and added several other hill forts to the one he had already seized. That of R\u00f3d\u00e1r, which is also near Kazwin, was next to Alahm\u00fat in consequence. Malik Shah Salj\u00faki, the reigning Sultan, had sent a force to reduce him, but without any success. In the month of October, 1092 A.D., Ramaz\u00e1n, 485 A.H., Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, who was then following the royal camp from Isfah\u00e1n to Baghd\u00e1d, was stabbed by one of the followers of Hasan Sabb\u00e1h who was his personal enemy.

The life of the child, however, was miraculously preserved; and the unnatural mother first recognised her son, when his fortune and valour had advanced him to the rank of a victorious general in her army.

He is the Hormidas of the Greek authors, and is said to have resembled, both in person and character, his grandfather Ard\u00e1\u0161ir. The mother of this monarch was the daughter of Mahr\u00fakh a petty prince, whom Ard\u00e1\u0161ir had put to death, and whose family he had persecuted, because an astrologer had predicted that a descendant of Mahr\u00fakh should attain the throne of Persia. This lady had fled to the tents of a shepherd where she was seen by Sh\u00e1hp\u00far when hunting. This prince became enamoured, and married her privately. His father Ard\u00e1\u0161ir, going one day unexpectedly to his son's house saw young Humrusz. He was greatly pleased with the appearance of the child and made enquiries, which compelled Sh\u00e1hp\u00far to confess all that had happened. The joy of the old king was excessive. The prediction of the astrologers, he exclaimed, \"which gave me such alarm, is now God confirmed, and a descendant of Mahr\u00fakh shall succeed to my crown.\" Humrusz was a virtuous prince, but resigned only one year and ten days.

His elder brother Firos, though at first compelled to fly across the Oxus, soon returned to assert his right at the head of a large army, which aided by a general defection of the Persians, who deserted his weak brother, obtained an easy victory, and the unfortunate Humrusz was, after a short reign of little more than one year, dethroned and put to death 457 A.D.\nHurmus or Hurmusd IV, (the Hormisdas III of the Greeks) was declared successor to his father the great Choosoe, surnamed Nauherwan the Just, and ascended the throne of Persia 579 A.D. His subjects revolted against him at the instigation of Bahram Chobin or Varanes his general, whom he had offended by sending him a female dress because he had been defeated by the Romans. They confined Hurmus and put out his eyes to disqualify him from ascending the throne, and soon after put him to death 590 A.D. His son Khusro Purves having collected a force to oppose Bahram, who with the intention of taking the government into his own hands was advancing towards Medinah, was defeated; but with great difficulty effected his escape to the territories of the Romans, from whose emperor Maurice, he met with the most friendly and hospitable reception.

He fought several battles with B\u00e1hl\u00f3l Lod\u00ed, the king of Dehl\u00ed, and was at last defeated, and so closely pursued that he left his horse and escaped on foot. The army of Dehl\u00ed advanced without any other check to Jaunp\u00far which fell to the arms of B\u00e1hl\u00f3l, while Husain Sh\u00e1h, abandoning his capital, was obliged to content himself with a small tract of country yielding only a revenue of five lakhs of rupees. B\u00e1hl\u00f3l having delivered over Jaunp\u00far and its kingdom to his own son B\u00e1rbak, enjoined him not to deprive Husain Sh\u00e1h of the small tract to which he was confined, terming it his family estate. This event took place about the year 1476 A.D., 881 A.H., and the subversion of the Sh\u00e1riki dynasty may be dated from that year. The reign of Husain Sh\u00e1h lasted for a period of 19 lunar years. Some years after the death of B\u00e1hl\u00f3l Lod\u00ed (which happened in 1489 A.D., 894 A.H.)

Jaunp\u00far fell shortly after, and was added to the kingdom of Dehl\u00ed.

He was a man of the greatest reputation for learning, versed in various sciences, and highly accomplished; he was a scholar, a poet, a compiler, and an historian. By his talents and writings, he merited the honorable title of \"the most learned man,\" and the ablest historian. His celebrated Biographical work, called the Wafiat-ul-Aiyar or deaths of eminent men, is the acme of perfection. This work was translated from the Arabic by Baron MacQucklin De Slane, Member of the Council of the Asiatic Society of Paris, &c., and published in 1842 A.D. This translation is a most valuable work to those who wish to gain a knowledge of the legal literature of the Muhammadians, as he has added to the text numerous learned notes, replete with curious and interesting information relating to the Muhammadian law and lawyers. Ibn-Khallikan was born on Thursday the 22nd of September, 1211 A.D., 11th Rabi' II, 608 A.H., and died on Thursday the 31st of October, 1283 A.D., 26th Rajab, 681 A.H., aged 73 lunar years, in the Najibia College at Damascus and was interred at Mount Kadyfuz.\n\nIbn-Khurdadbih, an historian, who died about the year 913 A.D.

Not long after, his hands and tongue were cut off by the order of Razi, because he had written a letter to the Khalif's enemy without his knowledge, from which he died in the year 939 A.D., 327 A.H. Ibn-Makla is the inventor of the present Arabic character which was afterwards improved by Ibn-Bawwab.\n\nIbn-Marduya, commonly called so, but his proper name is Abu Bakr.

He was born at Corduba in Spain, where his father held the office of high priest and chief judge, under the emperor of Morocco. His knowledge of law, divinity, mathematics, and astrology was very extensive, and to this was added the theory rather than the practice of medicine. On the death of his father, he was appointed to succeed him. Falling\nunder the suspicion of heresy, he was deprived of his posts, and thrown into prison, from whence he was at last delivered and reinstated in his office of judge. He wrote a treatise on the art of physic, an Epitome of Ptolemy's Almagest, a treatise on astrology, and many amorous verses; but when he grew old, he threw the three last into the fire. As to religion, his opinions were, that Christianity is absurd; Judaism, the religion of children; and Muhammadanism, the religion of swine. The best edition of his works is that of Venice, published in 1608. He is said to have died in 596 A.H., corresponding with 1199 A.D., but Lampride in his Universal Biography says, that he died at Morocco in 1206 A.D.\n\nIbn-Sabbagh-al-Shafai, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0635\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0641\u0639\u064a, surname of Ab\u00fa Nasr 'Abdul S\u00e1id-bin-Muhammad, author of the \"Uddat-ul-'Alim W\u00e1t Tariq-ul-S\u00e1lim.\" He died 1084 A.D., 477 A.H.\n\nIbn-Sad, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0635\u062f, author of the Tabak\u00e1t.\n\nIbn-Sina, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0633\u064a\u0646\u0627, vide Ab\u00fa Sina.\n\nIbn-Shahab-uz-Zohri, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0647\u0631\u064a, an Arabian author who flourished during the Khil\u00e1fat of 'Umar-ibn-'Abdul 'Az\u00eds.\n\nIbn-Siraj, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u0627\u062c, whose proper name is Ab\u00fa Bakr Muhammad, was an Arabian author, and died in 928 A.D., 316 A.H.\n\nIbn-Ukba, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0642\u0628\u0629, surname of Jamal-udd\u00edn Ahmad, author of the \"Umdat-nt-T\u00e1l\u00edb.\" He died 1424 A.D., 828 A.H.\n\nIbn-Ukda, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0642\u062f\u0629, vide Ab\u00fa'l-Abb\u00e1s Ahmad-bin-Muhammad.\n\nIbn-ul-Arab\u00ed, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a, vide Ibn-Arab\u00ed.\n\nIbn-ul-Hajar, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645\u0632, vide Ibn-Hajar.\n\nIbn-ul-Jasari-bin-Muhammad, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062c\u0633\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f, an Arabian author who died in the year 1430 A.D., 833 A.H.\n\nIbn-ul-Khashab, \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0634\u0628, whose proper name is Ab\u00fa Muhamad 'Abdullah, was an excellent penman.

It is said that he saw in a dream, a man on the top of a house looking for something. He asked him what he was looking for. The man replied that he had lost his camel. What a fool you must be, said the king, to be looking for your camel on the roof of a house. The man rejoined, And what a fool you must be to look for God in the cares and troubles of a crown!

He married the daughter of 'Ala-udd\u00edn 'Im\u00edd Sh\u00e1h, named Rabia Sul\u00e1ma in 1543 A.D., 950 A.H., reigned 24 lunar years and some months, and died in 1558 A.D., 965 A.H.

For some time Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n behaved with due moderation in his office; but at length was guilty of some violence towards Ch\u00e1nd Sult\u00e1na, who turned her thoughts to his destruction. She secretly sent a message to H\u00e1ji Kishwar Kh\u00e1n, an officer of high rank, who caused him to be murdered. After this event Kishwar Kh\u00e1n, by the support and patronage of Ch\u00e1nd Bh\u00ed, grasped the authority of the State, and ruled with uncontrolled sway, till he was assassinated. Akhl\u00e1s Kh\u00e1n next assumed the regency; but after some time he was seized by Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, who put out his eyes and became regent of the empire. He was expelled by the king in 1590 A.D., and his eyes put out and himself confined. In 1591 A.D., Tur\u00e1h\u00edm 'Adil Sh\u00e1h died after a reign of more than 28 lunar years, in 1626 A.D., 1036 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Muhammad 'Adil Sh\u00e1h.

From this battle we may date the fall of the Path\u00e1n empire, though that race afterwards made many efforts, and recovered it for a few years in the time of the emperor Hum\u00e2y\u00fan.\n\nIbrahim Husain Mirz\u00e1, a son-in-law of the emperor Hum\u00e2y\u00fan, and the second son of Muhammad Sult\u00e1n Mirz\u00e1, who had four other sons besides him, viz., 1st, Muhammad Husain Mirz\u00e1, 2nd, Ibrahim Husain Mirz\u00e1, 3rd, Mass\u00e1'id Husain Mirz\u00e1, 4th, Ul\u00e1gh Mirz\u00e1, who died in 1567 A.D., 975 A.H., and 6th, Sh\u00e1h Mirz\u00e1.

The race of Aghlab continued to enjoy their new principality peaceably till the year 910 A.D., 398 A.H., during which time they made several descents on the island of Sicily, and conquered a part of it. About this time, however, one Obaidull\u00e1h surnamed 'Al\u00ed Mahd\u00ed, rebelled against\nIbrahim Khan, son of the celebrated Amir-ul-Umr\u00e9 Ali Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n.

He was killed at Dacca 1623 A.D., 1032 A.H., in battle against prince Khurrum (afterwards Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n) who had rebelled against his father Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr.

He raised a considerable army and took possession of Dehl\u00ed and Agrah on the 23rd February, 1556 A.D., 6th Jam\u00e1da I, 962 A.H. He had no sooner ascended the throne, than another competitor arose in the province of the Panj\u00e1b, in the person of Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, a nephew of the late Sheir Sh\u00e1h. He defeated Ibrahim Kh\u00e1n in a battle, and the latter retreated to Sambhal, while Ahmad Kh\u00e1n took possession of Agrah and Dehl\u00ed, and assumed the title of Sikandar Sh\u00e1h in May the same year. Ibrahim Kh\u00e1n was killed by Sulaim\u00e1n, King of Bengal, in Orissa in a battle fought in 1567 A.D., 975 A.H., and is buried there. Amongst the incidents of the year 1556 A.D., 962 A.H., was the explosion in the fort of Agrah, when enormous stones and columns were sent flying several k\u00f3s to the other side of the Jama, and many people were destroyed. As the whole Fort was called B\u00e1dalgarh, the date was found in the words, \"The fire of B\u00e1dalgarh.\"\n\nIbrahim Khaw\u00e1s, a pupil of Ab\u00fa 'Abdullah Maghr\u00e1b\u00ed who died 911 A.D.

The last of these, Imam Mahdi, is supposed by them to be concealed (not dead), and the title which belongs to him, cannot, they conceive, be given to another: but among the Sunnis it is a dogma, that there must be always a visible Imam or \"father of the church.\" The title is given by them to the four learned doctors who are the founders of their faith, viz.: Imams Hanifa, Malik, Shaafi', and Hanbal. Of these four sects, the Hanbalite and Maliki may be considered as the most rigid, the Shaafi'ite as the most conformable to the spirit of Islamism, and the Hanifite as the wildest and most philosophical of them all. Two other Imams, Abu Daud-us-Zahiri, and Sufian-us-Saari were also chiefs of the orthodox sects, but their opinions had not many followers, and after some time were totally abandoned. Ibn-Jarf-at-Tabari, whose reputation as an historian is so familiar to Europeans, founded also a particular sect, which disappeared soon after his death.

They maintain, that Isma'il, who was the oldest son, but died during his father's life, should have succeeded to the dignity of Imam, and not Musi Kazim, who was his younger brother, and became the seventh Imam. Hasan Sabbah was of this sect. Vide Isma'ilis.\n\nIsmail I, Safwi, Shah, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0633\u0641\u0648\u064a, the son of Sultan Haidar, was the first monarch of the Safavid dynasty of kings who reigned in Persia. He traced his descent from Musi Kazim the seventh Imam, who was descended in a direct line from Ali, the son-in-law of Muhammad. Almost all his ancestors were regarded as holy men, and some of them as saints. The first of this family who acquired any considerable reputation was Shaikh Safi-ud-din, who had settled at Ardabil, and from whom the dynasty takes its name, Safawi or Safvi. His son Safiuddin Mosa, as well as his immediate descendants, Khwaja Ali, Shaikh Turhun Sultan, Junaid, and Haidar, acquired the greatest reputation for sanctity. Contemporary monarchs, we are informed, visited the cell of Safiuddin. The great Timur (Tamerlane), when he went to see this holy man, demanded to know what favour he should confer upon him. \"Release those prisoners you have brought from Turkey,\" was the noble and pious request of the saint. The conqueror complied; and the grateful tribes, when they gained their liberty, declared themselves the devoted disciples of him to whom they owed it. Their children preserved sacred the obligation of their fathers; and the descendants of the captives of Taimur became the supporters of the family of Safi, and enabled the son of a devotee to ascend one of the most splendid thrones in the world. Khwaja Ali, after visiting Mecca, went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and died at that city. His grandson Junaid, sat on the masnad as a spiritual guide after the death of his father Shaikh Ibrahim; and so great a crowd of disciples attended this holy man, that Jahangir Shah, the chief of the tribe of the Black Sheep, who at that time ruled Azurbayan, became alarmed at their numbers, and banished him from Ardabil. Junaid went to Dayarbikar, whose ruler, the celebrated Uzzan Hasan, received him kindly, and gave his sister in marriage to Junaid. He afterwards went with his disciples to Shirwan, where he was slain in a conflict with the troops of the king of that province in 1456 A.D., 860 A.H. His son Sultan Haidar succeeded him, and his uncle, Uzzan Hasan who had now by his overthrow of Jahangir Shah and Sultan Abu Said, become sovereign of all Persia, gave him his daughter in marriage. The name of this princess according to Muhammadan authors, was Alam Shoa', but we are informed by\na contemporary European writer, that she was called Martha, and was the daughter of Uzun Hassan by the Christian lady Dospina, who was a daughter of Calo Johnes, king of Trebizond. Sultan Haidar also lost his life from the wound of an arrow which he received in a battle with the troops of Shirwan Shah and Yakub Beg in July, 1488 A.D., Shaban, 939 A.H. Sultan Haidar had three sons by this princess; Sultan Ali, Ibrahim Mirza and Shah Isma'il. When Isma'il attained the age of fourteen (his elder brothers having died some years before), he put himself at the head of his adherents, and marched against the great enemy of his family the ruler of Shirwan, called Shirwan Shah, whom he defeated 1600 A.D., 906 A.H., and soon after; by another victory gained over Alwand Beg, the son of Yakub Beg, a prince of the dynasty of the White Sheep, he became the master of the province of Azarbijan, and established his residence at the city of Tabriz; and in less than four years became the acknowledged sovereign of the kingdom of Persia. He was born on the 17th July, 1487 A.D., 25th Rajab, 929 A.H., died after a reign of 24 lunar years on Monday the 23rd of May, 1524 A.D., 19th Rajab, 930 A.H., aged 38 years, and was buried at Ardibel. Muhammadan historians fix the commencement of his reign from the year 1500 A.D. He left four sons; Tahmasp, who succeeded his father, Sam Mirza, Bahr\u00e2m, and Ikhlas Mirza, and five daughters. He composed a Turkish Divan in which he uses the Takhallus of Khitab.\n\nThe following is a list of the Safavi kings of Persia.\n\n1. Shah Isma'il Safvi, 1st son of Sultan Haidar.\n2.

The short reign of this unworthy prince was marked by debauchery and crime. Immediately on his accession, he directed the massacre of all the princes of the blood-royal that were at Kazwin, except Ali Mirza whose life was spared; but even he was deprived of sight. His eldest brother Muhammad Mirza, who had a natural weakness in his eyes, which rendered him almost blind, and was during his father's life employed as governor of Khurasan, was then at Shiraz. Orders were sent to murder him and his son Abbas, but before they could be executed, Isma'il was found dead one morning in a confectioner's house, supposed to have been poisoned by his sister. His death happened at Kazwin on Sunday the 24th November, 1577 A.D., 13th Rajab, 985 A.H., after a short reign of one year and six months.

Their ruler, who may be justly termed the chief of the assassins residing in a lofty mountain called Alakh\u00e2d, and fate was in his hands; for there was no shape which his followers could not assume, no danger that they could not brave, to fulfil his mandates. These were the Isma'ilis or assassins, well-known by the Crusaders, as subjects of the Old Man of the mountain.

His father Burhan Shah having received assistance from the emperor Akbar, marched against his son, but was defeated. However in a short time after this, he renewed his attempts, and being joined by a great majority of the chiefs and people, attacked Jam\u00e2l Kh\u00e2n the king's minister, who was killed in the action on the 27th April, 1691 O.S., 13th Rajab, 999 A.H.

S\u00e1man, the great-grandfather of Isma'il, is termed, by European writers, a keeper of herds, and a robber; but this merely designates the occupation of a Tartar chief. His father Nasr Ahmad, the son of Asad, the son of S\u00e1man, was appointed governor of M\u00e1warun Nahr by the Kh\u00e1lif Mo'tamid in the year 875 A.D., 261 A.H. On his death his son Isma'il succeeded him. Isma'il, after his conquest over Am\u00fa-bihisht, as he seized and sent to Baghd\u00e1d, in 900 A.D., became independent.

One of the most beautiful examples of female modesty to be found in the annals of woman is recorded of this princess, celebrated in song and history as the heroic, the witty, the generous, the elegant, the accomplished, and the beautiful Jah\u00e1n Ar\u00e1 Begam. One night, (26th March, 1644 A.D., 27th Muharram, 1054 A.H.) as she was returning from her father's apartments to the harem, in one of the passages which connect the latter building with the body of the palace, her flowing drapery was unhappily ignited by the flame of a lamp. Her whole dress, which was of the finest muslin, was instantly in flames, and of course her life was in imminent peril; but, knowing that she was then within hearing of many young nobles of the court, she would not raise an alarm, lest they should run to her assistance, and behold her unveiled, or lay their hands upon her in order to extinguish the flames. Heroically enduring all the agonies which fire could inflict, she withheld her cries, and rushed forward until she reached the women's apartments, and there sunk upon the floor, almost lifeless. For a long period, no hopes were entertained of her recovery, but she was ultimately restored to health by an English physician named Dr. Boughton who was then at Surat, and had been sent for by the emperor her father then in the Dakhin, although her beauty was cruelly impaired. The emperor, in reward for Dr. Boughton's services, besides other favours, granted him, at his disinterested request, a patent for his countrymen to trade free of customs throughout his dominions. The large Masjid of red stone adjoining the fort of Agra near the Tripolia (now demolished) was built by her in the year 1644 A.D., 1058 A.H., at a cost of five lacs of rupees. She died in the reign of her brother's successor Alamgir on the 5th September, 1680 A.D., 3rd Ramzan, 1082 A.H., and lies buried in the yard of the mausoleum of Nizam-ud-din Aulia at Delhi. The name of Jah\u00e1n Ar\u00e1 will ever adorn the pages of history as a bright example of filial attachment and heroic self-devotion to the dictates of duty, more especially when we view it in contrast with the behaviour of her sister Roshan Ar\u00e1, who, by aiding the ambitious designs of Aurangz\u00e9b, enabled him to dethrone Shah Jah\u00e1n. The amiable and accomplished Jah\u00e1n Ar\u00e1 not only supported her aged father in his adversity, but voluntarily resigned her liberty and resided with him during his imprisonment in the fort of Agra. Her tomb is of white marble, open at the top, and at the head is a tablet with a Persian inscription inlaid in black marble letters, to the following effect: \"Let no one scatter over my grave anything but verdure, for such best becomes the sepulchre of one who had a humble mind.\" On the margin is written, \"The perishable fakir Jah\u00e1n Ar\u00e1 Begam, daughter of Shah Jah\u00e1n, and the disciple of the saints of Chishti, died in the year of the Hijra, 1092 A.H.\"\n\nJahan Bano Begam, \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0648 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0645, the daughter of Prince Murad, the son of the emperor Akbar. She was married to Prince Parvez, the son of Jahangir, by whom she had Nadira Begam, who was married to Dara Sheko, the eldest son of Shah Jah\u00e1n.\n\nJahandar Shah, \u062c\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u0647, surnamed Muhammad Muizz-ud-din, was the eldest son of the emperor Bahadur Shah, and grandson of Alamgir. He was born in the Dakhin on Wednesday the 8th April, 1663 A.D., 10th Ramzan, 1074 A.H. The death of his father, which took place in February, 1666 A.D., Muharram, 1124 A.H., was followed by the usual struggle among his sons for the crown. The incapacity of Jah\u00e1ndar Shah, the eldest, had given a great ascendancy to the second whose name was Asif-ush-Sh\u00e1n. He was supported by most of the nobility and of the army, but his other brothers joined their interests, and were kept together by the persuasions and false promises of Zulfik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n the Amir.\nJahandar Shah, Prince, the eldest son of the emperor Sh\u0101h 'Alam. In April, 1784 A.D., on account of the unsettled affairs of his father, he made his escape from Delhi and repaired to L\u0101h\u016bnau, where Mr. Hastings had arrived to regulate the concerns between the wazir, Asaf-uddaula, and the Company. He accompanied Mr. Hastings to Benaras, which place he chose for his residence. He had an allowance of five lacs of rupees per annum from the Naw\u0101b wazir at the earnest request of Mr. Hastings. He died in Benaras on the 1st of April, 1785 A.D., 25th Sh\u0101d\u0101n 1202 A.H., after an illness of little more than twenty-four hours; aged about 35 years, and was buried with every honour due to his rank near the tomb of a venerated Muhammedan in Benaras. The English Resident and principal people of the city attended his funeral. He left behind him three sons, whom, with the rest of his family, he recommended to the care of the English, under whom they still enjoy a comfortable asylum and allowance at Benaras. Gar\u00e7an-de-Tassy informs us, that there is a work of his in the India House, which has the title of \"Bay\u0101z Inayet Muhammed\u0101.\" He is also called Mirza Jawan Bahkt, and his poetical title is Jahand\u0101r. The narrative written by this prince, was translated by Mr. Scott, and published in the appendix to Mr. Hastings' Review of the state of Bengal.\n\nJahangir, (emperor) surnamed N\u016br-udd\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad, was the eldest son of the emperor Akbar the Great; was born in the village of Sikri on Wednesday the 31st of August, 1569 A.D., 17th Rab\u012b' I, 977 A.H., and was named Mirza Salim on account of his coming into the world, as supposed, by the prayers of Shaikh Salim Chishti, a venerable Shaikh and dervish who resided in the village of Sikri, now called Fatehpur Sikri, in the province of Agra. His mother, who received the title of Mariam Zamman, was the daughter of R\u0101j\u0101 B\u012bma, the M\u0101l\u0101 Kh\u0101nwa\u1e45k. After the death of his father, which took place on the 16th of October, 1605 A.D., he succeeded him by the title of N\u016br-udd\u012bn Mu\u1e25ammad Jahangir. He reigned 22 lunar years, 8 months and 15 days from the day of his father's demise; and died in camp on Sunday the 28th of Safar, 1627 A.D., 28th Safar, 1037 A.H., on his way to L\u0101h\u016br from Kashmir, aged 69 lunar years, 11 months and 12 days; and was interred in the suburbs of L\u0101h\u016br in the garden of his favourite wife N\u016br Jah\u0101n Begam. He was succeeded by his son Mirza Khurrum who took the title of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n. His favourite Sult\u0101na N\u016br Jah\u0101n, who survived him 18 years, is also buried in the same mausoleum. Jah\u0101ng\u012br, after his death, received the title of \"Jannat Mak\u0101n\u012b.\" It was to this prince that Sir Thomas Roe was sent as ambassador by King James I. Sir Thomas has given a good description of the grandeur of the court of Hindust\u0101n; but very little notice is taken of this embassy in the chronicles of the East. In 1612, Jah\u0101ng\u012br permitted the Company to establish factories at Sirat, Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, and Cambay. Jah\u0101ng\u012br wrote his own Memoir in Persian, called, \"T\u016bzak Jah\u0101ng\u012br,\" which has been translated by Major David Price, London, 1829, 184 pages 4to.

Udai Singh, the son of Rana Sanka or Sanga, and the founder of the capital Udaipur in Chitt\u00f3r, came under the displeasure of the emperor Akbar.

He was once defeated by Subaktagin, the Sultan of Ghazni, with great slaughter, and again on Monday the 27th November, 1001 A.D. by his son Sultan Mahm\u00fad, when Jaipal with fifteen of his principal chiefs, being his sons and brethren, were taken prisoners, and 5000 of his troops were slain on the field of battle. He was afterwards released by Mahm\u00fad, but in compliance with a custom which prevailed among the Hind\u00fas, that whatever r\u00e1j\u00e1 was twice overpowered by strangers, became disqualified to reign, he ordered a funeral pile to be prepared, and having set fire to it with his own hands, perished therein. He was succeeded by his son Anandp\u00e1l.\n\nJaipal II, \u062c\u06cc\u067e\u0627\u0644 \u062f\u0648\u0645, r\u00e1j\u00e1 of L\u00e1h\u00f3r, son of Anandp\u00e1l whom he succeeded in 1013 A.D.

This was the foundation of the Muhammadan empire in India.\n\nJai Singh I, \u062c\u06cc \u0633\u0646\u06af \u0627\u0648\u0644, (r\u00e1j\u00e1) of the tribe of Kachhw\u00e1h\u00e1, commonly called Mirz\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1, was the son of r\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1h\u00e1 Singh, the son of Part\u00e1p Singh, the son of r\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh.

He was recalled to court in 1666 A.D., but died on the road, soon after his arrival at Burhanp\u00far, 28th Muhrarram 1078 A.H. According to Orme's Historical Fragments of the Mughul Empire, Jai Singh died at Burhanp\u00far soon after the pretended revolt of Sultan Muazzim the son of the emperor, and seems to have been poisoned by the procurement of 'Alamg\u00edr. There never was a prince among the r\u0101jp\u00fats equal to him in accomplishments. He was completely learned in Hindi, and understood the Turkish, Persian and Arabic languages. He left two sons, Ram Singh his eldest, and Kir\u00e1t Singh. The former was honoured after his father's death with the title of r\u00e1j\u00e1, and put in possession of his father's territories. Jai Singh had built several fine edifices at Agrah of which no sign remains now, but the name and place on which the buildings stood is still called Jaisinghpura.\n\nJai Singh II, Saw\u00e1i, \u062c\u06cc \u0633\u0646\u06af \u062f\u0648\u0645, a r\u00e1j\u00e1 of the tribe of Kachhw\u00e1h\u00e1 r\u0101jp\u00fats, was the son of Bishun Singh, the son of Kishun Singh, the son of Ram Singh, the son of Mirz\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh. He is commonly called Mirz\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh Saw\u00e1i. He was the zamindar or r\u00e1j\u00e1 of a considerable territory in the province of Ajmir named Amer, but since the prince's founding a new city called Jaipur, the r\u0101j\u00e1ship has also taken the name. Bishun Singh, the father of Jai Singh and Bij\u00ed Singh, died about the year 1693 A.D., Sambat 1750, and after his death the title of r\u00e1j\u00e1 was bestowed on Jai Singh by the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr with the rank of 1500, and subsequently with that of 2000. After the death of that emperor, he exposed the cause of Azim Sh\u00e1h, the son of 'Alamg\u00edr; whilst his brother Bij\u00ed Singh aided Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, who on his accession to the throne conferred the rank of 3000 on the latter. Bij\u00ed Singh quarrelled with his brother for the r\u00e1j\u00e1; and the emperor, not willing to displease either, confiscated their estate, and appointed Sayyad Husain Ali Kh\u00e1n of B\u00e1h\u00e1, as Fa\u00fajdar of that place. When the emperor marched to the Dakhin to punish his brother K\u00e1m\u00e1kbahsh, 1708 A.D., 1120 A.H., Jai Singh, with the aid of r\u00e1j\u00e1 Aj\u00edt Singh R\u00e1th\u00f3r, engaged the Fa\u00fajdar in battle and having killed him took possession of the province. In the reign of Farrukh-siy\u00e1r he was honoured with the title of Dhir\u00e1j R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh, and in the time of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, with that of Saw\u00e1i. In the year 1732 A.D., 1146 A.H., he was appointed governor of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. His love of science makes him one of the most remarkable persons of his nation. He built five observatories for astronomical studies, namely, at Dehl\u00ed, Banaras, Mathr\u00e1, Ujain and Jaipur, and published a work on astronomy called \"Zij Muhammad Sh\u00e1h\u00ed.\" He also erected a Karav\u00e1nsar\u00e6 and market in every province of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n for the convenience of travellers at his own expense. After his death, which took place in September, 1743 A.D., 9th Sh\u00e1ban, 1156 A.H., three of his wives with many concubines burned themselves on his funeral pile.

Another work of Say\u016bt\u012b is called \"Lubab-ul-Lub\u0101b.\" It is a dictionary of patronymic names, and of others under which the Arabic authors are much more frequently quoted than under their proper names. The confusion under which the Arabs labour to identify men known under different names, has induced them to prepare dictionaries for obviating this difficulty. S\u0101m\u0101n\u012b (or Sam\u0101n\u012b) in the sixth century of the Hijra published one, entitled, \"Fil Ans\u0101b,\" in which he does not only explain the sense and origin of these names, but also mentions with regard to every word the true names of the authors who have had them. This work was abbreviated in the succeeding century by Ibn-ul-A\u1e63f\u012br, and this extract shortened by Say\u016bt\u012b. There is another work of Say\u016bt\u012b called \"Kashfus-Salsala-un-Wasfus Zalsala,\" containing an account of all the earthquakes which took place from the year 713 A.D., 94 A.H., to his time. He wrote this work on the occasion of an earthquake in Egypt, with a view of shewing to his countrymen that earthquakes are ordained by God to punish men for their sins. This work was translated from the Arabic by A. Sprenger, Esq., M.D. Vide Journal, Asiatic Society, Vol. XVII, Part II, p. 741.

It is said that he secretly followed the tenets of the Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs, but the people thought otherwise.

It is related that the emperor had ordered that all the ladies at court should provide precious stones, and bring them to a market-place that he had erected, and there show their wares publicly to the noblemen at court; they were ordered to buy them at whatever prices the ladies set upon them; and that the king himself was to be a buyer, to put the greater honour on the new erected market. The ladies obeyed, and took their booths, as they thought fit. On the market day, the king and the noblemen came to market, and bought the jewels and other trifles the ladies had to dispose of. The king coming to the booth of a very pretty lady, asked her what she had to sell. She told him she had one large fine rough diamond still to dispose of. He desired to see it, and he found it to be a piece of fine transparent sugar-candy of a tolerable diamond figure. He demanded to know what price she set on it, and she told him with a pleasant air, that it was worth a lakh of rupees, or \u00a312,500 sterling. He ordered the money to be paid, and, falling into discourse with her, found her wit was as exquisite as her beauty, and ordered her to sup with him that night in his palace. She accordingly went and stayed with him three nights and days, and then went back to her husband, whose name was Jamal Kh\u0101n. The husband received her very coldly, and told her that he would continue civil to her, but would never live with her again but in the same manner as if she was his sister. Upon which she went to the palace, fell at the emperor's feet, and told him what her husband had said. The king in a rage gave orders to carry her husband to the elephant garden, and there put him to death by an elephant. The poor man was soon apprehended, and as they dragged him from his house, he begged to have leave to speak to the king. A friend of his ordered the messengers of death to stop awhile, till he had acquainted the king with the request, which was accordingly done, and he was ordered to be carried into the court of the palace, that the king might hear what he had to say; and being carried thither, the king demanded what he would have. He answered, that what he had said to his wife was the greatest honour which he was capable of doing his king, because, after he had honoured his wife with his embraces, he thought himself unworthy ever after to cohabit with her. The king, after pausing a little, ordered him to be unbanded, and brought to his own room, where, as soon as he came, the king embraced him, and ordered a royal suit to be put upon him, and gave him command of five thousand horse more, but took his wife into his own harem.\u2014Asiatic Journal, Vol. XXX., p. 215.\n\nJamal-uddin Ahmad, Shaikh, \u0634\u064a\u062e \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f, a celebrated Muhammedan saint of Hana', and grandfather of Shaikh Kutb-uddin Manawwar.\n\nJamal-uddin Ataullah, Amir, \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0637\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, nephew of Sayyad Asf\u012b-uddin 'Abdull\u0101h.

Even princes, who were themselves men of erudition and exalted talents, have lavished upon him the most unbounded praises and the highest honours. He was very intimate with Sultan Abu Sa'id Mirza of Hira, who continued the friend of Jami so long as he lived. After his death, our poet enjoyed the same favours from his son and successor Sultan Husain Mirza. He was a contemporary of the esteemed Biographer, Daulat Shah, who recorded his fame in the Lives of the Persian poets, called \"Tazkira Daulat Shahi.\" Jami was the author of more than 44 works. His poem on the Loves of Joseph and Zalikha is one of the finest compositions in the language; it contains about 4000 couplets.

He is celebrated as the founder of Persepolis, which is to this day called Istakhr and Takht Jamshed. He introduced the solar year and ordered the first day of it, when the sun entered Arios, to be celebrated by a splendid festival. His country was invaded by Zuhak, a Syrian king, and the unfortunate Jamshed was obliged to fly before the conqueror. He was pursued by the agents of Zuhak, through Sistan, India, and China, and was at last seized and carried before his cruel enemy like a common malefactor, who ordered him to be placed between two boards and sawn asunder with the bone of a fish. We are told by Firdausi that his reign lasted 700 years. He is supposed to have flourished 800 years before the Christian era. His goblet, called Jam Jamshed and Jam Jam, was wondrous. A hundred marvellous tales are told of his celebrated cup, which used to dazzle all who looked on it, and has often been employed by the poets to furnish a simile for a bright eye.\n\nJamshed, this title is sometimes given by the Musalmans to king Solomon the son of David, and they say that his magic ring and throne possessed extraordinary powers, and his control was absolute over genii and men.\n\nJamshed Kutb Shah, son of Kulfi Kutb Shah I, ascended the throne of Golkonda in the Dakhin after the death of his father in September, 1643 A.D., Jumada II, 950 A.H.

Akbar Shah, who before the death of Muhammad Baki had gone to Lahore, and had remained there for some years, expected a personal visit from Jani Beg; but being disappointed he proceeded to take measures for the subjugation of that country. He therefore in the year 1591 A.D., 999 A.H. directed his commander-in-chief 'Abdul Rahim Kh\u00e1n, the son of Bairam Kh\u00e1n to proceed and occupy the place in his name.

A translation of part of it may be found in Sir William Jones's Second Volume of the Asiatic Researches. The author was a Jewish Rabbi, contemporary and opponent of Muhammad, and had written some satirical verses upon him; but afterwards being desirous of a reconciliation with the prophet, he wrote the above poem, which had the desired effect. Some authors say that he died in the first year of the Hijra, that is, 622 A.D., 1 A.H. But, according to Ockley's History of the Saracens, \"Ka'b came in the ninth year of the Hijra, and made his peace with Muhammad, with a poem in his praise.\" By this it appears that he was living in 631 A.D. He is said to have assisted Muhammad greatly in the compilation of the Kur\u00e1n. *Wilkin's Biographical Dictionary under Coab.*\n\nKa'b-al-'Ahbar, \u0643\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0628\u0627\u0631, a famous traditionist of the tribe of Hamyar, who embraced Isl\u00e1mism in the reign of 'Umar, and died in 652 A.D., 32 A.H., during the reign of 'Usm\u00e1n.\n\nKabir, \u0643\u0627\u0628\u0631, a celebrated Hind\u00ed poet, by trade a Musalm\u00e1n weaver, who, according to the Akbar-n\u00e1ma, was contemporary with Sikandar Sh\u00e1h Lodi, king of Dohl\u00ed. Kabir was a S\u00fafi or Deist of the most exalted sentiments and benevolence unbounded. His poems which are still universally esteemed, inculcate the purest morality, good will and hospitality towards all men; and breathe so fine a spirit of toleration, that both Hind\u00e1s and Musalm\u00e1ns contend for the honour of his having been born of their religion. From the disinterested, yet alluring, doctrines his poems contain, a sect has sprung up in Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, under the name of Kabir Panthi, who are so universally esteemed for veracity, and other virtues, among both Hind\u00e1s and Musalm\u00e1ns, that they may be with propriety considered the Quakers of this country. The time of Kabir's death seems involved in equal obscurity with the manner of his decease and burial. They relate that he lived a long time at K\u00e1s\u00ed (Ben\u00e1ras) and Gay\u00e1, and sojourned also at Jagarm\u00e1th, where he gave great offence to the Br\u00e1hm\u00e1ns, by his conduct and tolerant doctrine.

He succeeded his brother about the year 1269 A.D., 655 A.H., and founded the Yuen dynasty in China. Being ordered by his brother Mang\u00fa, then Khakan of the Mongols, to subjugate Corea and China, he entered China with an immense army in 1260 A.D., drove out the Tartars of the Kin dynasty and took possession of North China. In 1279 he completed the ruin of the Song dynasty by invading and subduing Southern China so that his dominion now extended from the Frozen Ocean to the Straits of Malacca and from Corea to Asia Minor\u2014an extent of territory, the like of which had never before, and has never since, been governed by any one monarch. The rule of the Mughuls, hitherto severe and barbarous, changed its character in the reign of this prince, who adopted entirely the manners of the Chinese, and who is regarded, even by that people, as one of the best and most illustrious of their emperors.

But the next of this family, K\u00e1b\u00fas, whose title was \"Shama'-ul-Mulk,\" or the candle of the kingdom, is celebrated for his extraordinary wisdom and learning. He was, by the instigation of his son Man\u00fachehr, slain by his own mutinous officers 1012 A.D., 403 A.H., whose excesses he had probably desired to restrain. He was succeeded by his son Man\u00fachehr, who submitted to the power of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed: but that monarch not only continued him in his family possessions, but gave him his daughter in marriage.

He was vain and proud; and appears to have been in continual distress from the unfortunate result of schemes that his ambition led him to form, but which he wanted ability to execute. His life is connected with a thousand fables, which though improper in this place, form excellent materials for Firduasi, who has given, in his history of this period, the extraordinary and affecting tale of the combat between Rustam and his unknown son, Suhrab, who is killed by his father. This part of the Shah-nama has been beautifully translated in English verse by J. Atkinson, Esq., Assistant Surgeon on the Bengal Establishment, and member of the Asiatic Society in 1814.

He had several battles with Afr\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1b the king of T\u00far\u00e1n, who was at last defeated, taken prisoner, and slain. Soon after these events Kaikhusro resolved to devote the remainder of his life to religious retirement: he delivered over K\u00e1b\u00fal, Z\u00e1b\u00falist\u00e1n and Nimr\u00f3z to Rustam, as hereditary possessions; and resigned his throne to Luhr\u00e1sp the son-in-law of Kaik\u00e1us and his own son by adoption and affection. After these arrangements, he went accompanied by some nobles to a spring which he had fixed upon as the place of his repose.

This prince had retired to the mountain of Alb\u00farz, from which place he was brought by Rustam the son of Z\u00e1l and proclaimed king of Persia. He committed the administration of government into the hands of Z\u00e1l, whose son Rustam, was appointed to lead the Persians against the dreaded Afr\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1b who had again passed the \u00d3xus and invaded Persia. In this battle, Rustam overcame Afr\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1b, and afterwards a peace was concluded, by which it was agreed that the \u00d3xus should remain as it had been heretofore, the boundary between the two kingdoms. Kaikub\u00e1d lived some time after this in peace: he is said to have reigned 120 years. He left four sons: Kaik\u00e1us, Ari\u0161, R\u00fam and Arm\u00e9n.

In the year 1287 A.D., 686 A.H., his father having heard the state of affairs at Dehl\u00ed, marched from Bengal to visit and advise his son. They met on the banks of the Gh\u00e1fr\u00e1 at Beh\u00e9r, and the whole scene was so affecting that almost all the court shed tears. On this occasion the celebrated poet Amir Khusro wrote the poem called the \"Kir\u00e1n-us-Sadain,\" or the conjunction of the two planets.

This king is stated to have reclaimed his subjects from a state of the most savage barbarity. They say he was the grandson of Noah, and the founder of the first dynasty of Persian kings called Pi\u00e1hd\u00e1dian. His son Si\u00e1mak was killed in one of the battles with the barbarians or Devs; and when that monarch carried Hoshang, the infant son of Si\u00e1mak, to share in the revenge he meant to take upon his enemies, his army was joined by all the lions, tigers and panthers in his dominions, and the Devs were routed and torn to pieces by the auxiliaries, who had left their native forest to aid the just king. After this victory, Kalomurs retired to his capital Bal\u00edkh.

He wrote the \"Nalodis\" for the purpose of exhibiting his unbounded skill in alliteration. In four books, containing on the average fifty-four stanzas each, he has given such illustrations of their subject as can never be surpassed. This work has been published in Europe, with a Latin translation by a continental scholar, Ferdinandus Benary. No reason can be imagined, why K\u00e1l\u00ed D\u00e1s should again write the history of Nala and Damayanti, after it had been so elegantly written in flowing verse by Vy\u00e1sa Deva, except that he intended in this simple story to shew forth his ingenuity in alliteration.

Kara Muhammad, the founder of the first dynasty, left his small territories, of which the capital was Van, in Armenia, to his son, Kara Y\u00fasuf, who though possessed of considerable power, was compelled to fly before the sword of Timur.

The history of Persia, from the death of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h till the elevation of 'Ak\u00e1 Muhammad, though it occupies nearly half a century, presents no one striking feature, except the life of Karim Kh\u00e1n, a chief of the tribe of Zand. He collected an army chiefly composed of the different tribes of Zand and Maffi, defeated the Afgh\u00e1ns in several engagements, finally drove them out of the country, and secured to himself the kingdom of F\u00e1rs, or the southern division of Persia, while Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n partially remained in possession of the descendants of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h; and the countries bordering on the Caspian Sea were retained by Muham-mad Hasan Kh\u00e1n K\u00e1ch\u00e1r, ruler of M\u00e1zind\u00e1r\u00e1n the great-grandfather of 'Ak\u00e1 Muhammad Sh\u00e1h K\u00e1ch\u00e1r. Karim Kh\u00e1n, after subduing his enemies, enjoyed independent power for twenty-six years; and during the last twenty-six, viz., from 1769 to 1779, he had been, without a competitor, the acknowledged ruler of Persia. His capital was Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. He died at an advanced period of life on the 2nd March, 1779 A.D., 13th Saf\u00e1r, 1193 A.H., being nearly 80 years of age. After his death Z\u00e1ki Kh\u00e1n assumed the reins of government, and was assassinated two months after. S\u00e1d\u00edk Kh\u00e1n, brother of Karim Kh\u00e1n took possession of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z after the death of Z\u00e1ki Kh\u00e1n, and was put to death on the 14th of March, 1781 A.D., 18th Rabi I, 1195 A.H., by 'Ali Mur\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, who now became the sovereign of Persia, and died on the 11th January, 1785 A.D., 28th Saf\u00e1r, 1199 A.H. After his death Lu\u00edf 'Ali Kh\u00e1n reigned for some years at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z.

He came from Kh\u00f3z\u00edst\u00e1n to the villages near Koff\u00e1, and there pretended great sanctity and strictness of life, and that God had enjoined him to pray fifty times a day; pretending also to invite people to the obedience of a certain Im\u00e1m of the family of Muhammed; and this way of life he continued till he had made a very great party, out of whom he chose twelve apostles to govern the rest, and to propagate his doctrines. Afterwards his courage failing him, he retired to Syria, and was never heard of any more. This sect began in the Khil\u00edf\u00e1t of Al-Mo'tamid: they multiplied greatly in Arabia, Ir\u00e1k, or Chaldeea, and maintained a perpetual war against the Khalif. In the year 931 A.D. they besieged and took the city of Mecca, filled the well Zamz\u00e1m with dead bodies, defiled and plundered the temple and carried away the black stone; but they brought it again in 950 A.D., and fastened it to the seventh pillar of the portico, giving out, that they had both taken it away, and brought it back again, by express order from heaven. This sect was dissipated by degrees, and at last became quite extinct.

After this Sindhia pretended to govern the possessions of the Holkar family in the name of Kashi Rao, whom he kept in a state of dependence and appropriated the revenue to his own use.

The English, deceived by his elegance of manners, and convinced of his skill in the finances of Bengal, raised him to the magad in the room of his father-in-law in 1780 A.D., 1174 A.H. He, in the latter years of his government, retired to Munger, and actuated by a keen resentment against the English, for their extensive encroachments on his authority, and the commerce of his country, formed the plan of throwing off their yoke, and annihilating their influence in Bengal; but was deposed and defeated, in a battle fought on the Odwa Nala on the 2nd August, 1763 A.D., 22nd Muharram, 1177 A.H., and the deposed Nawab Ja'far Ali Khan was again placed on the magad. Kasim Ali, incensed to madness at these reverses, fled to Patna from Munger, and there cruelly ordered the massacre of the English in his power; there were 60 gentlemen, Messrs. Ellis, Hay, Lushington, and others, and 100 of lower rank. On the 5th October, they were brought out in parties, and barbarously cut to pieces, or shot under the direction of a Captain named Samru or Sombre. Munger fell to the English early in October. Patna was stormed on the 6th November, and the Ex-Nawab Kasim Ali fled to the wazir of Audh, with his treasures, and the remnant of his army. On the 23rd of October, 1764 A.D., Major Carnac fought the celebrated battle of Buxar, completely routing the wazir Shuja-uddaula's army. The following day the Mughul emperor Shah Alam threw himself on the protection of the British, and joined their camp with the imperial standard of Hindustan. The British army advanced to overrun Audh. The wazir refused to deliver up Kasim Ali, though he had seized and plundered him. Kasim Ali made his escape at first into the Rohela country, with a few friends and some jewels, which he had saved from the fangs of his late ally, the wazir, and found a comfortable asylum in that country; but his intrigues rendered him disagreeable to the chief under whose protection he resided, he was obliged to leave it, and took shelter with the Ranas of Gohad. After some years' residence in his country, he proceeded to Jodhpur, and from thence came to try his fortune in the service of the emperor Shah Alam about the year 1774 A.D., 1188 A.H., but was disappointed, and died shortly after in 1777 A.D., 1191 A.H., at Kotwal an obscure village near Delhi, unloved even by his own family.

In his youth he dedicated himself, under the guidance of Shaikh Sad-ruddin Musa Ardibeli, to the contemplative life and deep study of the Sufis. He then journeyed to Gulistan, where he soon acquired great fame; and subsequently went into Khurasan. During his residence at Hird, he obtained such celebrity, and was surrounded by so many princes and learned men, his followers, that Mirza Shahrukh (the son of Amir Timur), moved by jealousy of the Sayyad, and attentive to the danger of the increase of the Sufi creed, commanded him to retire from the capital. In order to mitigate the harshness of this command, Baisanghar, the son of Shahrukh, a learned and noble prince, took upon himself to make it known to the Sayyad, which he did in the most humane manner, inquiring of him, in the course of conversation, why he did not follow the counsel contained in his own verse. The Sayyad inquired in which verse, and Baisanghar immediately quoted the following:\u2014\n\n\"Kasim cease at once thy lay;\nRise and take thy onward way;\nOther lands have waited long,\nWorthy thy immortal song:\nGive the bird of paradise\nWhat the vulture cannot prize;\nHoney let thy friends receive,\nTo thy foes the carrion leave.\"\n\nThe Sayyad thanked him, and immediately set out for Balkh and Samarqand, where he remained for a time. He afterwards, however, returned to Hird, where as before, he was constantly followed by great and powerful men. His death occurred in the village of Kharjarid in Jam near Hird, where a garden had been bought for him by his disciples, in which he greatly delighted.

His full name is Ghay\u00e1sudd\u00edn Muhammad bin Ham\u00edd-udd\u00edn Khond Amir. He is the author of the history called \"Khul\u00e1sat-ul-Akhb\u00e1r,\" which is considered to be an abridgment of the \"Rauzat-us-S\u00e1fa;\" this book he wrote in 1498 A.D., 904 A.H., and dedicated it to Amir 'Al\u00edsh\u00e9r his patron. He was born, says Sir H. M. Elliot, at H\u00edrat about the year 1475 A.D., 880 A.H., for he states in the preface to the \"Hab\u00edt-us-Siar,\" that when he commenced it in the year 1521 A.D., 927 A.H., he had advanced through seven or eight stages beyond the fortieth year of his life. It was after the name of his patron Kar\u00edm-udd\u00edn Hab\u00edb-ull\u00e1h, a native of Ardel\u00edb, that he entitled his work \"Hab\u00edt-us-Siar.\" Besides the abovementioned works, he composed the \"M\u00e1sir-ul-Mal\u00edk,\" the \"Akhabar-ul-Akhb\u00e1r,\" the \"Dastur-ul-Wara,\" the \"Mukhr\u00edm-ul-Akhlag,\" and the \"Muntakhab T\u00e1rikh W\u00e1s\u00e1fi.\" There are two other works ascribed to him, called \"Ghar\u00e1b-ul-Asr\u00e1r,\" and \"Jawh\u00e1r-ul-Akhb\u00e1r.\" He was compelled to leave H\u00edrat on account of the disturbed state of the country in 1527 A.D., 933 A.H., and afterwards took a journey to Hindust\u00e1n in company with Maul\u00e1\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h\u00e1budd\u00edn the minister and Mirz\u00e1 Jor\u00e1h\u00ed R\u00e1nd\u00ed, esteemed the most literary men of the age. On Saturday the 19th of September, 1529 A.D., 936 A.H., they reached the metropolis of Agr\u00e1h, and were introduced to the emperor B\u00e1bar Sh\u00e1h. They were loaded with presents and directed to remain in future about his person. Khondamir accompanied the emperor on his expedition to Bengal, and upon his death attached himself to his son Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, in whose name he wrote the \"Kan\u00e1n Hum\u00e1y\u00fani,\" which is quoted by Ab\u00fa'l Fazl in the Akbar-n\u00e1m\u00e1. He afterwards accompanied that monarch to Gujr\u00e1t, and died in camp during the emperor's march from Khandesh to Mand\u00fa in pursuit of B\u00e1hd\u00far Sh\u00e1h Gujr\u00e1t\u00ed. This event took place in 1536 A.D., 942 A.H., some time after the death of his friend Maul\u00e1\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h\u00e1budd\u00edn, who died the same year. At his own request his body was conveyed to Dehl\u00ed, and was buried by the side of Niz\u00e1m-udd\u00edn Aulia and Am\u00edr Khusr\u00f3. The last and 7th book of the \"Rauzat-us-S\u00e1fa\" was written by him.\n\nKhub, \u062e\u0628, the poetical appellation of Kam\u00e1l-udd\u00edn Sh\u00edst\u00e1n\u00ed, the author of a mystical masnav\u00ed in the Gujr\u00e1t dialect, composed in 1578 A.D., 986 A.H.

He died at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d on Monday the 1st of November, 1731 A.D., 1144 A.H., and his son Shaikh Muhammad Nas\u00edr, whose poetical name was Fa\u017el\u00ed, succeeded him.

She was a widow and dealt in merchandise. She had employed Muhammad for some time to drive her camels, and afterwards married him. Muhammad had several children by her, but all of them died young, excepting three daughters, one of whom was Fatima, who was married to Ali. After her marriage with Muhammad she lived 22 years, and died at Mecca three years before the commencement of the Hijra era, and three days after the death of Abu Talib the father of Ali, and uncle of Muhammad, in August, 619 A.D., aged 62 lunar years. Mr. Buckland informs us that the tomb of Khudya is still remaining, and is regularly visited by pilgrims. It is enclosed by a square wall, and presents no objects of curiosity except the tombstone, which has a fine inscription in Kufic characters, containing a passage from the Koran, from the chapter entitled, \"Sura-ul-Kursi\".\n\nKhurdaibih, \u062e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0628\u0647, or Ibn-Khurdaibih, son of Abul Kasim 'Ubayd-Allah bin Ahmad (or 'Abdullah) Ibn-Khurdaibih. This author has been the object of considerable controversy among the orientalists of Europe. Khurdaibih (the grandfather of our author) was a magician, and was converted to Islam by the Barmaides. Abu'l Kasim (our author) was consequently appointed over the poor and intelligent department in the provinces belonging to the Jabal (mountain); subsequently he came to the court of the Khalifa Mu'tamid and became one of his privy counsellors. He is the author of several works, among which are\u20141, \"Kitab Adab-as-Samad\" (from which Masa'udi gives a very interesting extract in his life of Mo'tamid); 2, \"Kitab Jamhir Ansab-ul-Fars\" containing the most celebrated Genealogies of the Persians; 3, \"Kitab-al-Maslik-wal-Mumlik,\" a geographical work on the roads and kingdoms; 4, \"Kitab-al-Sharab,\" on drink; 5, \"Kitab-ul-Lahw-wal-Malai,\" on playing and amusements; 6, \"Kitab-al-Anwa,\" on the stars, and 7, \"Kitab-ul-Nudam-wal-Julas\" on courtiers and companions. The Geography of Ibn-Khurdaibih, says Sir H. M. Elliot, is the only work which we possess of this author, and of this there is only one copy in Europe. The MS. in question is ancient, bearing the date of 1232 A.D., 630 A.H., but it wants in most instances the diacritical points. It is preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. No. 993. Ibn-Khurdaibih died about the year 912 A.D., 300 A.H.\n\nKhurram Bakht, Mirza, \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u062e\u0631\u0645 \u0628\u062e\u062a, the son of Mirza Jahandar Shah, the son of Shah 'Alam, king of Delhi.\n\nKhurram Begam, \u062e\u0631\u0645 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0645, the wife of Mirza Sulaiman Badakhshi.\n\nKhurram, Mirza, \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u062e\u0631\u0645, original name of the emperor Shah Jahangir before he came to the throne.

His father Amir Mahmud Saifuddin, a Turk of the tribe of Lachin, came from Balkh to India and fixed his residence at Patiala where Khusro was born in the year 1253 A.D., 651 A.H. Khusro died six months after the death of Nizamuddin Aulia, who was his spiritual guide, and was buried close to his tomb at Ghayaspur in old Delhi. His death happened in September, 1325 A.D., Ramzan, 725 A.H. Khusro unfortunately lived at a period, says Sir H.M. Elliot, when vice was triumphant throughout Hindustan. He, however, had the happiness, during the last few years of his life, to see a just prince, Ghayasuddin Tughlaq, on the throne, whose virtues he has commemorated in his history, called \"Tughlaq-nama,\" and whom he survived but a few months. The following beautiful poems are particularly admired by his countrymen; and in fact they rival those of the most esteemed poets of Persia.\n\n1. Tuhfat-ul-Saghir.\n2. Shatt-ul-Hayat.\n3. Ghurrat-ul-Kamal.\n4. Baqia Naqia.\n\nBesides these there are several other poems, viz., \"Nuh Sipehr,\" or the nine spheres, a beautiful mystical poem; the \"Kirin-us-Sad-dyn\" or the auspicious conjunction, a poem in praise of Sultan Muizzuddin Kaikubad, king of Delhi, and his father Nasiruddin Baghra Khan, king of\nKhusro\n\nBengal, who came to visit him. The \"Mak\u012bla\" containing memoirs of the first four Khalifas, viz., Ab\u016b Bakr, 'Umar, Usm\u0101n and 'Al\u012b, with a treatise on the Sufi tenets, written in 1324 A.D., the \"Ishk\u0101,\" a collection of poems on love subjects; the \"Math\u0101'ul-Anwar,\" on the Sufi doctrines, and his Diw\u0101n which is held in great estimation in India, containing poems chiefly on mystical theology and divine love: many of them have been set to music, and are chanted by the devotees or Sufis; frequently, producing extravagant ecstasies, termed by them wajid, or spiritual delirium. The Khamas or the five celebrated books of Amir Khusro, which contains about 18,000 verses, are the following:\n\n1. Haq\u012bqat B\u0101hiya.\n2. Sikandar-n\u0101ma.\n3. Panj Ganj.\n4. Lail\u012b-wa-Majn\u016bn.\n5. Sh\u012br\u012bn-wa-Khusro.\n\nKhusro is said to have written 99 books, some of which, besides the abovementioned, are the following:\n\n1. Aj\u012bz Khusrowi.\n2. \u0100ma Sikandari.\n3. Khizir Kh\u0101n\u012b.\n4. Insh\u0101' Am\u012br Khusro.\n5. Jaw\u0101hir-ul-Bahr.\n\nKhusro Malik, son of Khusro Sh\u0101h, was the last Sultan of the race of Ghaznavides. He ascended the throne at L\u0101hore after the death of his father in 1160 A.D., 556 A.H., was defeated in 1184 A.D., 580 A.H., by Sh\u0101h\u0101t-udd\u012bn Ghor\u012b, then governor of Ghazni, who took him prisoner and sent him to his brother Ghay\u0101sudd\u012bn to F\u012br\u014dz K\u014dh, where he died after some years.\n\nKhusro Malik, the brother-in-law of Sultan Muhammad Sh\u0101h I, Tughl\u0101k, whose sister named Khud\u0101wandz\u0101da he had married. He had once formed the project of taking the life of Sultan F\u012br\u014dz Sh\u0101h the successor of Muhammad Sh\u0101h, by concealing a number of persons in the rooms adjacent to where the king sat, but was saved by D\u0101w\u0101r Malik, the son of Khusro Malik, who made a sign to him that danger was to be apprehended, upon which the king left the room and took refuge on the top of the house.\n\nKhusro Parw\u0113z, the son of Hurmuz III (or IV), king of Persia of the Sassanian race. He, by the assistance of the Roman emperor Maurice, after defeating Bahr\u0101m Ch\u014dbin, his father's general, who had taken possession of the kingdom, ascended the throne of Persia 591 A.D. The moment he was firmly established on the throne, he fulfilled in the most faithful manner the engagements he had entered into with his ally; and publicly adopted the emperor Maurice as his father; but when that emperor was slain in 603 A.D., he instantly declared war, on the grounds of avenging his father and benefactor. His generals invaded the Roman territories; Dara, Edessa, and other strong places on the frontier, were soon subdued; Syria was completely pillaged, Palestine overrun, Jerusalem taken, and the true cross, which had been enclosed in a golden case, and buried deep in the earth, was discovered, and borne in triumph to Persia. His reign of more than 30 years, was marked by a success never surpassed by the most renowned of his ancestors. Persia was, however, invaded by Heraclius the Roman emperor, who defeated the troops of Khusro wherever he encountered them, and marched, in one direction, as far as the Caspian, in another to Isfah\u0101n; destroying in his progress all his splendid palaces, plundering his hoarded treasures, and dispersing, in every direction, the countless slaves of his pleasure. The subjects of Khusro had lost all regard for a monarch whom they deemed the sole cause of the desolation of his country: a conspiracy was formed against him: he was seized by his eldest son Shroya or Siroe; his 18 sons were massacred before his face, and he was cast into a dungeon, and soon afterwards died or was put to death in 628 A.D., 7 A.H., after he had reigned 38 years. The glory of the house of Chooses (Nausherw\u0101n) ended with the life of Khusro: his unnatural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his crime.\n\nThe Muhammedan authors say, that Khusro had received an epistle from Muhammed inviting him to acknowledge Muhammed as the apostle of God. He rejected the invitation, and tore the epistle. \"It is thus,\" exclaimed the Arabian prophet, \"that God will tear the kingdom, and reject the supplications of Khusro.\" The historians of Muhammed, says Gibbon, date this embassy in the seventh year of the Hijri which commenced 11th May, 628 A.D. Their chronology is erroneous since Khusro died in the month of February of the same year. Gibbon, Vol. VIII, p. 205.\n\nKhusro Shah, \u062e\u0633\u0631\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0647, a descendant of the ancient kings of Badakhsh\u0101n, whom B\u0101bar Sh\u0101h defeated about the year 1505, and took possession of his country and made it over to his cousin Kh\u0101n M\u012brz\u0101.\n\nKhusro Shah, \u062e\u0633\u0631\u0648 \u0634\u0627\u0647, surnamed Niz\u0101m-udd\u012bn, was the son of Bahr\u0101m Sh\u0101h of Ghazni.

The different rulers who have governed in the provinces of Jaunpur and Antarbed (territories south of Delhi lying between the rivers Jamna and Ganges) are styled by historians the Sharki kings.

The reign of Mahmud Shah was interrupted by serious internal commotions; and Khwaja Jahan taking advantage of these circumstances, and perceiving the weakness of the government arising out of the king's minority, assumed the title of Malik-ush-Shark (King of the East), founded an independent kingdom at Jaunpur, and died in the year 1400 A.D., 802 A.H., after a short reign of six years. He was succeeded by his adopted son Malik Wasiul or Karanfai, who assumed the title of Mubarak Shah Sharki, and died in 1402 A.D., 804 A.H.

At length he was induced to attack Ghazn\u00ed. Sultan Bahr\u00e1m obtaining intimation of his intentions contrived to get him into his power, and eventually put him to death. This is the origin of the feuds between the houses of Gh\u00f3r and Gharn\u00ed.

He was still an idolater when Muhammed commenced publishing his laws. One of his poems commenced with this verse: \"All praise is vain which does not refer to God: and all good which proceeds not from Him is but a shadow;\" no other poet could be found to compete with it. At length the chapter of the Kur\u00e1n, entitled Bardi, was attached to a gate in the same temple, and Lab\u00edd was so overcome by the verses at the commencement, as to declare that they could only be produced by the inspiration of God, and he immediately embraced Isl\u00e1mism. When Muhammed was apprised of the conversion of Lab\u00edd, the finest genius of his time, he was exceedingly delighted, and requested him to answer the invectives and satires of Amra-al-kay and other infidel poets who wrote against the new religion and its followers. The following sentence is also attributed to him, which is the finest which ever fell from the lips of an Arab:\u2014\"All is vain which is not of God.\" Lab\u00edd is said to have lived to the age of 140 years, and died at the city of Kufa in 141 of the Hijra (768 A.D.).

These two lovers are very famous throughout the East. Laili was the daughter of a neighbouring Chief. She was equally accomplished with her lover: and nothing seemed likely to disturb the happiness which their permitted attachment promised, till the avarice of her father destroyed at once all their hopes. Laili was commanded to think of Kais no more, as she was destined to be the bride of one more rich and powerful; and in spite of the grief and remonstrances of the unfortunate pair, they were separated. Kais became insane from disappointment, and his name was therefore changed to Majn\u00fan, (the distracted).

He is the greatest of the Oriental moralists, and hold in the highest esteem by the Orientals for his wisdom and virtues; even Muhammad speaks of him in the 31st chapter of the Koran which is called Sura Lukman, with profound reverence. Lukman's wisdom, like Solomon's, is supposed to have been of divine origin. One day as he was in his room, working at his trade (he was a carpenter) several angels invisibly entered and saluted him. Lukman, hearing voices, looked around him, but not seeing any one, made no reply. The angels then said: We are messengers from God, thy Creator and ours, who hath sent us to thee to inform thee, that He designs to make thee a monarch and His vicegerent on earth. Lukman answered: If it be the absolute will of God that I shall become a monarch, that will must be accomplished; and I trust that He will grant me grace to execute His commands faithfully; but if the liberty of choice be given me, I should prefer abiding in my present condition; the only favour that I ask from God being, that He would preserve me from offending Him, for were I to offend Him, all the dignities of the earth would be but a burden to me. This reply was so agreeable to God that He at once bestowed on Lukman the gifts of Knowledge and Wisdom to a degree hitherto unparalleled. The Maxims of Lukman are ten thousand in number; and \"any one of these,\" says an Arabian commentator, \"is of much greater value than the whole world.\" His wisdom and the striking morality of his fables, are so like those of Esop that he is considered by some as the same personage.\n\nLutf, the poetical name of Mir Amman, a Hindustani lyric poet, and one of the learned natives formerly attached to the College of Fort William.

This work has been comparatively eclipsed by its commentary, the Sharh al-Wilaya by 'Ubad-ud-din Mas'ud; this author's work combines the original text with a copious gloss explanatory and illustrative. Both the Wilaya and the Sharh al-Wilaya are used for elementary instruction in the Muhammedan Colleges. Other commentaries on the Wilaya exist, but they are of no great note.\n\nMahmud, an Afghan chief of Kandahar of the tribe of Ghilzai, was the son of Mir Wais, after whose death in 1715 A.D. he succeeded him. He besieged Isfahan in 1722 A.D., and compelled Sultan Husain Safvi, king of Persia, to surrender and resign his crown to him. The king went forth with all his principal courtiers in deep mourning, surrendered himself to Mahmud, and with his own hands placed the diadem on the head of the conqueror. The event took place on the 11th October of the same year, 11th Muharram, 1136 A.H.\n\nAfter two years' possession of the sovereign power, he gave orders for the death of the Safavid princes, who were his prisoners, and thirty-nine of them, some grown up, others in their childhood, were barbarously slaughtered. It is said that he became deranged the same night, and not only tore his own flesh, but ate it. Every person that approached him, he overwhelmed with abuse, and in this condition died in 1725 A.D. But before his death the Afghans, being threatened by an attack of the Persian prince, Tahmasp Mirza, the son of Sultan Husain, who had fled from Isfahan, elected Ashraf, the cousin of Mahmud, to be their ruler, who in April, 1724 A.D., 12th Sha'ban, 1137 A.H. murdered Mahmud, and became the king of Persia.\n\nMahmud, the son of Sultan Mohammad Saljuki.

He died on the 30th June, 1839 A.D., 1255 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Abdul Majid. The reign of Mahmud has been full of important events. The Greeks, in 1821 A.D., threw off the Ottoman yoke, and after a singularly contest have been declared independent; and in 1828 A.D., a war with Russia took place, in which the armies of Mahmud were uniformly defeated, and the Russians were only prevented from advancing to Constantinople by large concessions on the part of the Turks, and the mediation of the European powers.\n\nMahmud bin-Faraj, a famous impostor who gave himself out for Moses risen from the dead: but was flogged to death by the order of the khalif Mutwakil.\n\nMahmud Boria, Pahlawan, a Muhammedan saint of Persia who followed the occupation of a boatman, and is the author of the work called \"Kitab Kanz.\"\n\nMahmud Gawan, Khwaja, styled Malik-ut-Tajjar Khwaja Jahang, was the wazir of\nMahmud Shah I, Bahmani, the fifth Sultan of the race of Bahmani kings of the Dakhin, was the youngest son of Sultan 'Al\u00e1-udd\u00edn Hasan.

He was raised to the throne of Delhi after the death of his brother Humayun Shah in April, 1394 A.D., 7th Jumada I, 798 A.H., at the age of ten years. His minority and the dissensions of the nobles encouraged many of the surrounding chiefs to revolt and become independent. In his time Amir Timur invaded India, and defeated Mahmud Shah in a battle fought (according to Firista on the 15th of January, 1399 A.D., 7th Jumada I, 801 A.H.) and according to Sharafuddin Yezdi, on Tuesday the 7th of Rabi II, 801 A.H., corresponding with the 17th December, 1398 A.D., when Mahmud fled to Gujrat, and Timur the next day took possession of Delhi.\n\nOn the eighth of Rabii-ne-Sani, with the sun In Capricorn, Timur died Delhi won.\n\nTimur died Delhi won.

Mahmud Shah died on the 4th of March, 1413 A.D., 29th Zil-Ka'da 815 A.H., and was succeeded by Daulat Khan Lodi. With Sultan Mahmud the empire of Delhi fell from the race of the Turks who were adopted slaves of Sultan Shahabuddin Ghori.\n\nMahmud, Sultan, the celebrated king of Ghazni, was the eldest son of Sultan Nasiruddin Subaktakin. His father at his death, 997 A.D., 357 A.H., unmindful of the superior right of Mahmud (who was then employed in the government of Khurasan), bequeathed his kingdom to Isma'il, a younger son. Isma'il attempted to confirm himself in the power to which he was raised, but on the approach of Mahmud, after a vain attempt at resistance, he was compelled to throw himself upon the clemency of his offended brother. Mahmud reigned more than 33 lunar years, during which time he made twelve expeditions into India; took Lahore, Delhi, Kanauj and other parts of Hindustan; many Hindu temples of the Hindus he levelled with the ground; many thousand idols he demolished, and broke to pieces the famous idol of Somnath, the fragments of which he distributed to Ghazni, Mecca and Medina.

This was doubtless another marriage of policy, for Maimuna was 51 years of age, and a widow, but the connexion gained him two powerful proselytes. One was Khalid, the son of Walid, a nephew of the widow, who by his prowess obtained the appellation of \"The Sword of God.\" The other was Khalid's friend, Amru the son of 'As; the same who assailed Mu\u1e25ammad with poetry and satire at the commencement of his prophetic career. Maimuna was the last spouse of the prophet, and, old as she was at her marriage, survived nearly all his other wives. She died many years after him in a pavilion at Sarif, under the same tree in the shade of which her nuptial tent had been pitched, and was there interred. This event took place about the year 671 A.D., 51 A.H.\n\nMaisana, \u0645\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0629, the Bedouin bride of the khalif Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya I, and the mother of Yezid, was a daughter of the tribe of Kalab; a tribe remarkable for the purity of dialect spoken in it. She was married to Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya whilst very young; but this exalted situation by no means suited the disposition of Maisana, and amidst all the pomp and splendour of Damascus, she languished for the simple pleasures of her native desert. She was an excellent poetess, and had pleased Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya far more than he did with some of her verses, that he made her go back into the desert amongst her own relations, and take her son Yezid along with her, that he also might be brought up a poet. This part of the education succeeded, for he was reckoned to excel in that way, though his chief talent consisted in making himself a drunken wretch. Maisana did not revisit Damascus till after the death of Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya, when Yezid ascended the throne.\n\nMajd-uddin Ahmad ibn-Muhammad Sajawandi, \u0645\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0633\u062cwand\u0649, author of a commentary or Tafsir called \"Ain ul-Ma\u02bfani.\" There is another work of the same title on Sufism written by Shah\u0101b-uddin Burh\u0101np\u016br\u012b.\n\nMajd-uddin Baghdadi, \u0645\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u063a\u062f\u0627\u062f\u064a, a pupil and disciple of Shaikh Najm-uddin Kubr\u0101.

It is said that he privately got married to the mother of the Sultan, who no sooner heard of it, than he ordered Majd-uddin to be thrown into a lake where he died.

The Hind\u016bs insist that the emperor Akbar was a Hind\u016b in a former generation. The proximity of the time in which this famous emperor lived, has forced them, however, to account for this in the following manner:\u2014\"There was a holy Brahman of the above name, who wished very much to become emperor of India, and the only practicable way for him was to die first, and be born again. For this purpose he made a desperate Tapassana, wishing to remember then every thing he knew in his present generation. This could not be fully granted; but he was indulged with writing upon a brass plate a few things which he wished more particularly to remember; then he was directed to bury the plate, and promised that he should remember the place in the next generation. Makunda went to Allahabad, buried the plate and then buried himself. Nine months after he was born in the character of Akbar, who, as soon as he ascended the throne, went to Allahabad, and easily found the spot where the brass plate was buried.\" (Mill's Book of India, Vol. II, page 152.) The translation of the inscription on the brass plate, is as follows: \"In the Samvat year 1598 on the 12th day of the 2nd fortnight of the month of M\u0101gh, I Makunda Bramhch\u0101ri, whose food was nothing but milk, sacrificed myself at Par\u015b\u0101g (Allah\u0101bd) the grand place of worship, with the design that I should become the ruler of the whole world.\" The above date corresponds with the 27th of January, 1542 A.D., and Akbar was born on Sunday the 15th of October the same year, being three or four days less than nine lunar months after the above circumstance.\n\nMaldeo Rao, \u0645\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648 \u0631\u0627\u0624, a r\u0101j\u0101 of M\u0101rw\u0101r of the R\u0101thor tribe of r\u0101jputs, and a descendant of Jodh\u0101 R\u0101o who founded Jodhpur.

At that time Malhar R\u0101o the present ruler was a prisoner.

From that period up to the time the Naw\u00e1b of Audh resumed the grant, the Muhammadans had the supremacy over the Hind\u00fas, but in 1801 A.D., when the district was ceded to the British, the Hind\u00fas taking courage came and resided there; since then there have always been feuds between the parties.\n\nMalik Kummi, Mulla, a native of Kumm in Persia.

He succeeded his father Alp Arsalan in December, 1072 A.D., 465 A.H., and reigned twenty years. His right to the crown was disputed by his brother K\u0101dir Beg, also called K\u0101dard (which see) prince of Kirm\u0101n; but that chief was defeated and taken prisoner, and afterwards poisoned or put to death. Malik Shah subdued almost the whole of Syria and Egypt; and being more fortunate than his father, not only conquered Bukh\u0101ra, Samarqand and Khw\u0101rizm, but received homage from the tribes beyond Jazartes. After the death of his waz\u012br Niz\u0101m ul-Mulk, he moved from Isfah\u0101n to Bagh-d\u0101d, with the design of transplanting the khalif Al-Muk-t\u0101di, and fixing his own residence in the capital of the Moslem world.

This Era, according to Dr. Hyde commences 15th March, 1070 A.D., corresponding with the 11th Ramaz\u0101n 471 A.H. Malik Shah left four sons Barkay\u0101rak, Mu\u1e25ammad, Sanjar, and Mahm\u016bd, all of whom attained power in their turns. Mahm\u016bd the youngest, was only four years of age when his father died; but the ambition of his mother, the Sult\u0101na Kh\u0101t\u0101n Turk\u0101n, placed the crown upon his infant head. However, she was soon compelled to resign, and after some time they both died, and Sultan Barkay\u0101rak succeeded him.\n\nMalik Sharki, Mirza, an author.\n\nMalik ul-Afs\u0101l, Malik al-Afs\u0101l, surnamed N\u016br-udd\u012bn 'Al\u012b, the eldest of the seventeen sons of S\u0101lih-udd\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn-Ayy\u016bb. On the death of his father at Damascus in 1193 A.D., 589 A.H., he took possession of that kingdom, whilst his brother Malik ul-Afs\u0101l 'Usm\u0101n obtained that of Egypt, and their brother Malik uz-Z\u0101hir continued to hold Aleppo. Damascus was afterwards besieged and taken by his uncle Malik ul-'Adil Saif-udd\u012bn Ab\u016b Bakr (the Saphadin of Christian writers). N\u016br-udd\u012bn 'Al\u012b in a poetical address to the khalif N\u0101\u1e63ir, lamented the similarity of his own fate to that of the khalif 'Al\u012b ibn-Ab\u016b Talib (his namesake) in being thus excluded from his rights by Ab\u016b Bakr and 'Umar; the khalif in his reply consoled him by the assurance that in him he should find the N\u0101\u1e63ir (protector) whom 'Al\u012b had sought in vain; but the intercession of the khalif was unavailing to procure the restitution of any part of his territories. In 1198 A.D., however, on the death of his brother, the Sultan of Egypt, N\u016br-udd\u012bn became \u0100t\u0101b\u0101d or guardian, to his infant nephew Malik ul-H\u0101mid, and attempted by the aid of his brother, the Sultan of Aleppo, to recover Damascus from his uncle; but the expedition failed, and Saif-udd\u012bn retaliated by invading Egypt, and expelled the young Sultan and his guardian, 1199 A.D. The unfortunate N\u016br-udd\u012bn now retired to Samoesta, where he died apparently without issue. He was born in June, 1171 A.D., whilst his father was acting as waz\u012br to the Egyptians. He died suddenly in February, 1225 A.D., Safar 622 A.H., and was buried in Aleppo.

In the reign of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far, the son of Ardisher, king of Persia, about the year 277 A.D., a painter, named M\u00e1n\u00ed, having learned from the conversation of some Christians, that the Redeemer had promised to send a Comforter, after him, formed the wild design of passing for the Paraclete; and, as no opinions are so absurd, as not to be embraced, he soon drew together a multitude of proselytes. Sh\u00e1hp\u00far was enraged at this imposture, and wished to punish the author of it; but M\u00e1n\u00ed found means to escape, and fled as far as the borders of China, having first told his followers, that he was going to heaven, and promised to meet them in a certain grot, at the end of the year. In this retreat he amused himself with painting a number of strange figures and views, which at the year's end, he shewed to his disciples, as a work given to him by angels. He was a very ingenious artist, and had a lively fancy, so that his pictures, which were finely coloured, easily persuaded the credulous multitude, in the infancy of the art in Asia, that they were really divine; they were bound together in a book called Artang, which is often alluded to by the Persian poets. Mingling the pure doctrines of Christianity with paganism, he taught that there were two principles of all things, coeternal and coeval, that is, God and the Devil, that from the former all good, and from the latter all evil proceeded. The good being, he called, the author of the new testament, the bad of the old. God, he added, created the soul, the devil, the body. He pretended also to work miracles, and was therefore sent for by Sh\u00e1hp\u00far to cure his son, but his pretended power failed him, the child died in his arms, and the disappointed father ordered the prophet to be flayed alive, and his skin stuffed with chaff to be hung up at the gates of the capital, where Epiphanius who refused his doctrines, saw it. Some say this impostor was put to death in the reign of Bahr\u00e1m, grandson of Sh\u00e1hp\u00far.\n\nM\u00e1n\u00ed, a poet, who although called K\u00e1sagar M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n\u00ed, i.e., a porcelain manufacturer of M\u00e1zandar\u00e1n; yet his talents introduced him to Muhammad Muhs\u00edn Mirz\u00e1, a son of Sult\u00e1n Husain Mirz\u00e1, in whose service he was killed by the Uzbeks in 1507 A.D., 913 A.H.

Disasters or disappointments either soured the temper or affected the reason of M\u00e1n Singh, who became one of the most sanguinary monsters that ever disgraced the gadd\u00ed. His death was announced on the 20th of September, 1843 A.D. The M\u00e1rv\u00e1r succession question was settled in favour of Ahmadnagar on the 7th November, 1843, the choice falling not on the young heir of that house, but on his father Takht Singh, who was unanimously elected, and whose son accompanied him as prince royal.

He compelled the Dilm\u0101ni ruler of Fars and 'Ir\u0101k to pay him an annual tribute of 150,000 dinars of gold; and the peace, by which this tribute was fixed, was cemented by his marriage with the daughter of Rukn-uddaula, the reigning prince of that family. Amir Mansur died after a reign of 15 lunar years on the 16th of March, 976 A.D., 11th Rajab, 365 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Amir N\u016bh II.

The Musalm\u0101ns differed in their opinions about the character of this person. Some took him to be a saint, and gave out that he performed miracles; others believed him to be a sorcerer or a juggler, and that he only deceived people with his tricks. He was, however, condemned and sentenced by the khalf\u012bf of Baghd\u0101d, Makr\u0101dar, and was put to death, because he used to proclaim \"An-ul-hak,\" i.e., \"I am the truth,\" or in other words, \"I am God.\" When they had taken him to the place of execution, they first cut off both his hands, and then his legs; they plucked out his eyes, cut out his tongue, and separated his head from his body. They then burned his mangled corpse to ashes, and threw it into the Tigris. This circumstance took place in the year 919 A.D., 308 A.H., but according to Ibn-Khallik\u0101n, on the 24th Z\u012b-Ka'da, 309 A.H., corresponding with 26th March, 922 A.D. Shaikh Husain is commonly called Mansur Hallaj\u012b though it is the name of his father. He is considered by the S\u016bf\u012bs to be one of their most eminent spiritual leaders, who, they believe, had attained the fourth or last stage of S\u016bf\u012bsm.

Manuchehr died after a reign of 120 years, and was succeeded by his son Nauzar, in the latter part of whose reign died S\u0101m, the son of Narim\u0101n. After the death of S\u0101m, Pashang the king of Tur\u0101n invaded Persia with a force of 30,000 men, commanded by his son Afrasi\u0101b.

In another place they found the image of an old man, made of green stone sitting upon a sofa, and wrapped up in a garment. Before him were statues of little boys. Having proceeded further they met with the image of a cock made of precious stones and placed upon a green column.

During the reign of Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, he went from India to Shir\u00e1z, where his\nfollowers soon amounted to more than thirty thousand. The orthodox priests took alarm, and prevailed on the mild Karim Kh\u00e1n to banish the saint from his capital, but his reputation was increased by the act of power which proclaimed him dangerous. After Karim Kh\u00e1n's death, Mir Ma's\u00edm, who resided in a small village near Isfah\u00e1n, departed his first disciple, Fayz 'Ali, to teach in that city. That holy person soon died, and was succeeded in his office by his son N\u00far 'Ali Sh\u00e1h; who, though young in years, was, (to use the phrase of his historian), \"old in piety.\" The number and rank of Mir Ma's\u00edm's followers excited alarm in the priests of Isfah\u00e1n, who transmitted so exaggerated an account of the vile heresies of the S\u00faf\u00eds to 'Al\u00ed Mur\u00edd Kh\u00e1n, the king, and recommended him so strongly to support the faith, by punishing those whose opinions were alike hostile to true religion and good government, that the monarch, the moment he received their representation, sent orders to cut off the noses and ears of some among the most zealous of the obnoxious sect; and as a further disgrace, to shave the beards of all who had adopted their opinions. The ignorant soldiers intrusted with the execution of this mandate, were not very capable of discriminating between true believers and infidels: and we are assured by a contemporary writer, that many orthodox Muhammadians had their noses and ears cut off, and their beards shaved on this memorable occasion.\n\nMir Ma's\u00edm 'Ali and N\u00far 'Ali Sh\u00e1h, after wandering from one place to another, re-visited Kirm\u00e1n, where Mush\u00e1tk 'Ali, the most pious of his disciples, was put to death. At Kirm\u00e1nsh\u00e1h N\u00far 'Ali Sh\u00e1h was placed in confinement; and Mir Ma's\u00edm was murdered when at prayers in the midst of his followers. This sect, however, notwithstanding the efforts of their enemies, continued to increase in numbers; and N\u00far 'Ali Sh\u00e1h, with all who adhered to him, were banished the kingdom. His avowed disciples were at this period about sixty thousand; but many more were supposed to be secretly devoted to him. He is said to have died at Mau\u00e9al. It is related that two inhabitants of Kirm\u00e1nsh\u00e1h, who were distinguished by an extraordinary appearance of zeal, doused his dinner on the day that he was suddenly attacked by violent spasms, which in a few hours terminated his existence. Their flight led all to suspect them of having poisoned him. N\u00far 'Ali died at 9 o'clock on the morning of the 3rd June, 1800 A.D., 10th Mu-harram, 1215 A.H. He expired close to the grave of the prophet Jonas, within a league of Mau\u00e9al.\n\nMat\u00edn, the poetical name of Shaikh 'Abdul Raza bin-'Abdullah Mat\u00edn.

Having lost his pension owing to the change of rulers, he proceeded to Bengal where he died in 1761 A.D., 1176 A.H., and left a Diw\u00e1n of 5000 verses.\n\nMa'tmid Khan, \u0645\u0645\u062a\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0646, vide Ma'tmid Kh\u00e1n.\n\nMatrasi, \u0645\u0637\u0631\u0632\u06cc, surname of Muwayyad, the grandfather of Shaikh Nim\u00e1mi of Gauja.

Arab writers make him to be descended in a right line from Ishmael the son of Abraham; but do not pretend to any certainty in the remote part of his genealogy. He lost his father, 'Abdullah, before he was two years old, and his mother, 'Amina, before he was six; but their attention was supplied by the care of his grandfather 'Abdul Mutallib, who at his death, which happened two years after, left him under the guardianship of his son Abu Talib with whom he continued till he was twenty-five, when he was placed in the service of a woman, named Khudya, the widow of a rich merchant at Mecca, who sent merchandise into Syria. This woman fell in love with Muhammad, the driver of her camels, and married him. In his frequent journeys through Arabia, he had observed the various sects which divided the opinions of the eastern Christians, and he considered that nothing could so firmly secure to him the respect of the world as laying the foundation of a new religion. He, in his 40th year assumed the title of the Apostle of God, and gradually increased his fame and his followers by the air of pretended visions. When he found himself exposed to danger at Mecca, he left the city and retired to Madina, where his doctrines found a more friendly reception. This event which happened in the year 622 A.D., forms the celebrated era of the Muhammadans, called the hijra or hirj, which signifies Separation. At Madina the prophet erected his standard, and as for thirteen years before he had endeavoured to spread his doctrines by persuasion, he now propagated them by the sword. In the eleventh year of the Hijra, the prophet fell sick, and after a confinement of thirteen days, he died on Monday the 8th of June, 632 A.D., 12th Rab\u012b' I, 11 A.H., aged 63 lunar years. He was buried in the same place where he died, in the chamber of the most beloved of his wives 'Ayisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, at Madina, where his remains...\nare still preserved. It is very remarkable that though Muhammad himself so often declared in the Kur\u00e1n that he wrought no miracles, yet his followers have ascribed a great many to him. For instance, they affirm, that he caused water to flow from his fingers; that he split the moon in two; that the stones, trees, and beasts acknowledged him to be the true prophet sent from God, and saluted him as such; that he went one night from Mecca to Jerusalem, from whence he ascended up to heaven, where he saw and conversed with God, and came back again to Mecca before the next morning; with many more miracles equally incredible. Muhammad permitted by his law, four wives to each of his followers; but did not limit himself to that number; for he observed that a prophet, being peculiarly gifted and privileged, was not bound to restrict himself to the same laws as ordinary mortals. The authors who give him the smallest number of wives, own that he had fifteen, four of whom, however, never shared conubial rites. Their names and the year when they died, are as follow:\n\n| A.D. | A.H. |\n|------|------|\n| 1. Khudyja, the daughter of Khawylid died 3 years before the Hijri era, aged 65. | 619 |\n| 2.

He was a brave and politic monarch, conquered Cappadocia, Servia, Wallachia, and other provinces, and was at peace with Manuel Pal\u00e6ologos, emperor of Constantinople, to whom he restored some of his provinces, and died at Andrianoople of a bloody flux 1422 A.D., 825 A.H., aged 47 years. He was succeeded by his son Mur\u00e1d II (Amurat).\n\nMuhammad II, (Mahomet II) emperor of the Turks, summoned the Great, succeeded his father Mur\u00e1d II (Amurat) in February, 1441 A.D., Muhamar, 855 A.H. His reign was begun with preparations for war; he besieged Constantinople, and conveyed over the land some of his galleys into the harbour, which the Greeks had shut up against the invaders. Constantinople was taken by him on Tuesday the 29th of May, 1453 A.D., 20th Jum\u00e1da I, 857 A.H., and in her fall poured forth her fugitive philosophers and learned men to revive literature in the Western world. Muhammad by his victories, deserved the name of Great; and the appellation of Grand Seignor, which he assumed, has descended to his successors. After subduing two empires, twelve tributary kingdoms and two hundred towns, he was preparing for the subjugation of Italy, when a colic proved fatal to him, and he died on Thursday the 3rd May, 1481 A.D., 3rd Rab\u00ed' I, 886 A.H., after a reign of 31 lunar years. His death was the cause of universal rejoicings over the Christian world, whose religion he had sworn to exterminate, for the tenets of Muhammad. He was of an exceeding courage and strength, of a sharp wit, and very fortunate; but withal, he was faithless and cruel: and in his time occasioned the death of 80,000 Christians of both sexes. His son B\u00e2yezid II succeeded him.\n\nMuhammad III, (or Mahomet III), emperor of the Turks, succeeded his father Mur\u00e1d III in January, 1596 A.D., Jum\u00e1da I, 1003 A.H. to the throne of Constantinople. He began his reign by ordering nineteen of his brothers to be strangled, and ten of his father's wives to be drowned, whom he supposed to be with child. He made war against Rodolphus II, emperor of Germany, and invaded Hungary with an army of 200,000 men, but his progress was checked by Maximilian the emperor's brother, who would have obtained a decisive victory, had not his troops abandoned themselves to pillage. Muhammad, obliged to retire from Hungary, buried himself in the indolence of his seraglio. He died of the plague, after a reign of 9 years in January, 1604 A.D., Sh\u00e1h\u00e1n, 1012 A.H., aged 69 years, and was succeeded by his son Ahmad I.\n\nMuhammad IV, (or Mahomet IV), emperor of the Turks, was the son of Ibrahim, whom he succeeded on the throne of Constantinople in 1649 A.D., 1059 A.H. He pursued the war with the Venetians, and after reducing Candia, with the loss of 200,000 men, he invaded Poland. His arms proved victorious, but the disgrace was wiped off by the valour of Sobeski, king of Poland, who the next year routed his enemies at the battle of Chocim. He was deposed in 1687 A.D., 1098 A.H., and sent to prison where he died in 1691 A.D., 1102 A.H. He was succeeded by his brother Sulaim\u00e1n II.\n\nMuhammad Abd, (or Mahomet Abd), author of a Persian work on Jurisprudence called \"Ans\u00e1 ul-Isl\u00e1m,\" the Foundation of Muhammedanism, and of one called \"Fikha Sunnat wa-Jam\u00e1s't.\"\n\nMuhammad 'Adil Shah, (or Mahomet 'Adil Shah), king of Bij\u00e1pur, succeeded his father Ibr\u00e1him 'Adil Shah II, in the year 1626 A.D., 1036 A.H. As the armies of the emperor of Delhi were daily extending their conquests in the Dakhin, and he knew that should the country of Ahmadnagar be reduced, his own would become the object of attack, he assisted Niz\u00e1m Shah against the imperial arms; and more than once suffered for his conduct, being obliged to purchase peace by large contributions. In the year 1634 A.D., 1044 A.H. the armies of the emperor Shah Jahan invaded the Dakhin on three quarters and laid waste the country of Bij\u00e1pur without mercy. After the reduction of Daulatabad and other forts, with most part of the kingdom of Niz\u00e1m Shah, Muhammad 'Adil Shah agreed to pay a considerable tribute to the emperor. He was the last king of Bij\u00e1pur who struck coins in his own name. In the latter part of his reign, his vassal Sowj\u00e1, the son of S\u00e1h Bh\u00f3sha, by treachery and treachery, obtained great power, and the foundation of the Bij\u00e1pur monarchy became weakened. He died in November, 1656 A.D., Muhamar, 1067 A.H. and was succeeded by his son 'Al\u00ed 'Adil Shah II. His tomb at Bij\u00e1pur called \"Gol Gumber,\" has a dome which measures 130 feet in diameter which can be seen from 30\nMuhammad\n\nA beautiful view is seen from the roof; the tomb being at the very end of the city, all the remarkable places present themselves to us, and the eye loses itself in the vast number of cupolas, domes, and minarets crowded together.

He is the author of several works; was born on the 28th October, 1628 O.S., 10th Rabi' I, 1038 A.H., and died aged 87 lunar years on Friday the 2nd of January, 1713 O.S., 15th Zil-hijjah, 1124 A.H.

Upwards of twelve centuries have passed since Egypt fell under the arms of the successful General of the Khalif Omar; for a little over five centuries it remained in the possession of the successors of the conqueror; their power was put to an end by the Turkomans in 1171 A.D., and about eighty years afterwards the latter were in their turn expelled by the Mamlooks. The Mamlooks raised one of their own number to the throne, with the title of Sultan, and the dynasty lasted till 1517, when the last of the Mamlook Sultans was put to death by the Turkish Sultan Salam, who appointed a Pasha to the government assisted by a council of twenty-four Mamluk beys or chiefs. This state of things lasted till 1798, when the French under Bonaparte landed in Egypt, and after destroying the Mamlooks, were themselves attacked and defeated by the British in 1801. After the departure of the British, the country fell into anarchy till it was restored by Mu\u1e25ammad 'Ali, who by the massacre of the remaining Mamlouks made himself master of the situation. The treaty of London in 1841 made the government of Egypt hereditary in the family of Mu\u1e25ammad 'Ali, and Ism\u00e1'il Pasha is his grandson. Egypt has now ceased to be a province of Turkey. Its ruler has had all the powers of an independent sovereign conceded to him by the Farman which dates from the 8th of June, 1873 A.D. Mu\u1e25ammad was born in 1769, entered the Turkish army, and in 1799 was sent to Egypt at the head of a contingent to co-operate with the British against the French invaders. Here his fine military qualities rapidly developed themselves, and he at length became the Commander of the Albanian Corps d'arm\u00e9e in Egypt. He was soon after involved in disputes with the Mamlooks who had long practically ruled Egypt. They were at length entirely exterminated in 1820. He declared himself independent of the Porte in 1838, and died on the 2nd August, 1849 A.D. He was succeeded by his son or grandson Ism\u00e1'il Pasha.\n\nMuhammad 'Ali Shah, whose former title was Naw\u00e1b Nasir-uddaula, was the son of Sa'd\u00e1t 'Ali Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of Audh. He was placed on the throne of Lakhnau by the British, after the death of his nephew, Sulaim\u00e1n Jah Nasir-udd\u00edn Haidar, on the 8th of July, 1837 A.D., 4th Rabi' II, 1253 A.H. at the age of 70 years, and took the title of Ab\u00fa'l Fatha Moin-udd\u00edn Sultan Zam\u00e1n Mu\u1e25ammad 'Ali Shah. He reigned exactly five lunar years, and died at Lakhnau on Tuesday the 17th May, 1842 A.D., 5th Rabi' II, 1258 A.H., when his son Suryya Jah Amjad 'Ali Shah succeeded him.\n\nMuhammad al-Mahdi, the first khal\u00edf or king of Barbary of the race of the Fatimites. He began to reign in 908 A.D., 296 A.H., and was supposed to be a descendant of Husain the son of 'Ali and Fatima, whence the race is called Fat\u00edmite. His descendants conquered Egypt. He died in 933 A.D., 321 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Ka\u00e9m Bi\u00e1m-ullah, who died in 945 A.D., 334 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Mansur Bill\u00e1h in 952 A.D., 341 A.H. Vide Maizli-ud-din-Allah.\nMuhammad Amin, son of Daulat Muhammad al-Husaini al-Balkhi, is the author of the work called \"Anfa' ul-Akhb\u00e1r,\" or Useful Chronicle; was in the service of Naw\u00e1b Sipahdar Kh\u00e1n, who receives a long and laudatory notice at the close of the work. He concluded it in 1628 A.D., 1036 A.H., and styled it Anfa' ul-Akhb\u00e1r, because the Hijri year 1036 A.H. in which it was completed, is represented by the letters composing those words. He resided chiefly at Ahmadnagar.\n\nMuhammad Amin Khan, author of the work entitled \"Aaraf ul-Ma'ani,\" a collection of poems on the conquests of the emperor 'Alamgir, and a panegyric on several cities of the Dakhin, which previous to its being subdued by his arms, was esteemed the garden of India.

He was the chief counsellor of the emperor Muhammad Shah, and was appointed Wazir with the above title after the death of Sayyad Hussain 'Ali Khan and the imprisonment of his brother Sayyad 'Abdullah Khan in 1720 A.D., 1133 A.H., but he had scarcely entered on his office when he fell ill and died suddenly on the 17th of January, 1721 O.S., 29th Rabi I, 1133 A.H.

One alone of this celebrated man's works, called Hakk ul-Yakini, which he dedicated to Shah Husain, extends to fourteen folio volumes. It contains a body of the theology of the Shias, and quotes and refutes the arguments opposed to the opinions advanced, illustrating the whole with evidences of the truth of the Shia doctrines and with numerous traditions.

This work, though mentioned by Hajji Khalifa, had hitherto escaped the industry of European explorers, but a portion of it (four books) has been found in the Royal Library of Paris, and the remainder in Herr von Hammer-Purgstall's collection. By a passage in the Fehrist, that learned gentleman has found that the Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) had a Persian origin. In the eighth book, the author says that the first who composed tales and apologues were the kings of the first dynasty of the Persians; then those of the Arsacides the third of the four ancient dynasties of Persia; these tales were augmented and amplified by the Sassanides. The Arabs, he then proceeds to say, translated them into their tongue, composing others like them. The first book of this kind was the Hazar Afsana, or Thousand Tales, the subject of which the writer explains, mentioning Shahrada and Dinara as the two females who practice the ruse upon the king. \"It is said,\" continues the author, \"that this book was composed by Humida, the daughter of Bahman.\" The truth is, that the first who\nMuhammad had these tales told him at night, was Alexander the Great, in order that he might keep awake, and be upon his guard. The kings who came after him made use, for the same purpose, of the Thousand Tales, which fill up a thousand nights, and two hundred conversations beside, in the light of the moon, which were related in a number of nights. *Asiatic Journal*, Vol. XXXI, p. 237.\n\n**Muhammad bin-Ismail**, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0650\u064a\u0644, *vide* Muhammad Isma'il and Al-Bakhari.\n\n**Muhammad bin-Jarir Tabari**, \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f \u0628\u0652\u0646 \u062c\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0631\u064a, author of several works.

He by the command of the khalif in the year 711 A.D., 92 A.H., marched with a large army to Sindh and having defeated and killed the rajah of that country took possession of it on Thursday the 23rd June, 712 A.D., 10th Ramazan, 93 A.H. From amongst the prisoners captured in the fort of Alor, two daughters of the rajah were sent to Damascus, and the khalif sent them to his harem, consigning them to the care of his people until their grief should be assuaged. After two months, they were brought to the presence of the khalif; when they raised the veils from their faces, the khalif was smitten with their beauty, and asked their names; one was called Girpaldeo, the other Suraideo. The khalif ordered one to his own bed; she said, \"O my Lord, I am not fit for the king's service, we have both for three days been with Bin-Kasim, who after dishonouring us, sent us here.\" The king was highly incensed, and directed that his servants should seize Bin-Kasim, sew him up in a cow-hide, and send him to Syria. When Bin-Kasim received this order, he directed the messengers to do as they were directed. They obeyed the order, covered Bin-Kasim with a raw cow-hide: after enduring the torture for three days he died. They then put his body into a box, and conveyed it to the khalif who opening it in the presence of the two women, said, \"Behold how absolute is my power, and how I treat such servants as Bin-Kasim.\" The women replied, \"Oh king, just men ought not to be precipitate in great affairs, or be too hasty to act, either upon the representation of friends or foes.\" The khalif asked their meaning; they said, \"We made this accusation against Bin-Kasim because of the hatred we bore him, believing that he slew our father; and through him we lost all our property and possessions, and became exiles from our own country; but Bin-Kasim was like a father and brother to us, he looked not on us for any bad purpose, but when the object was vengeance for the blood of our father, we accused him of this crime; why: this end attained, do with us as you will.\" The khalif on hearing this, suffered great remorse: he ordered the two women to be tied to horses, and dragged to death, and they buried Bin-Kasim in the burial place at Damascus.

The name of this monarch, as inscribed on the walls of some of the apartments of the Alhambra, was Ab\u00fa 'Abdull\u00e1h, but is commonly known in Moorish history as Muhammad Ibn-Al-ahmar. He was born in Arjona, in 1196 A.D., 591 A.H. of the noble family of the Bani Nasar; when he arrived at manly years, he was appointed Alcayde or governor of Arjona and Ja\u00e9n, and gained great popularity by his benignity and justice. Some years afterwards, on the death of Ibn-H\u00fad, when the Moorish power of Spain was broken into factions, many places declared for Muhammad Ibn-Al-ahmar; he seized upon the occasion, made a circuit through the country, and was everywhere received with acclamation. It was in the year 1238 A.D., that he entered Granada amidst the enthusiastic shouts of the multitude. He was proclaimed king with every demonstration of joy, and soon became the head of the Molems in Spain, being the first of the illustrious line of Bani Nasar that had sat upon the throne. He caused the mines of gold and silver, and other metals found in the mountainous regions of his dominions, to be diligently worked, and was the first king of Granada who struck money of gold and silver with his name, taking great care that it should be skilfully executed. It was about this time, towards the middle of the 13th century, that he commenced the splendid palace of the Alhambra. He retained his faculties and vigour to an advanced age. In his 78th year, he took the field against horseback, accompanied by the flowers of his chivalry, to repel an invasion of his territories, but was suddenly struck with illness, and in a few hours died vomiting blood, and in violent convulsions.

It contains 9,850 traditions, selected from 167,000; recording not only all the revelations, inspirations, actions, and sayings, of Muhammad, but also explaining many of the difficult passages of the Kur\u00e1n. It relates besides many miracles and anecdotes of the ancient prophets, and other inspired persons. He was born in the year 810 A.D., 194 A.H., and died in the month of June, 870 A.D., Raj\u00e1b, 266 A.H. He is commonly called Al-Bukh\u00e1r\u00ed, which see.\n\nMuhammad Isma'il Moulwi, author of the \"Sir\u00e1t ul-Mustak\u00edm\" or \"The True Path,\" containing an account of the peculiar tenets held by the followers of Say\u00edd Ahmad the modern Muhammedan zealot and reformer, with whose name we have recently become familiar. This work is one of the most important of several treatises which have been composed by that sect. The main object of the author in composing it, was, in the first instance probably to shew his own learning; in the next, to justify the claims of Say\u00edd Ahmad, (of whom he was a constant and confidential adherent,) as a devotee, gifted with a surpassing degree of religious capacity and illumination. It makes reference especially, in its explanations and allusions, to the peculiar divisions which prevail in India, among those who aspire to the honors of religious initiation. These are generally numbered as the followers of one or other, of three venerated P\u00edrs, each of whom has given a name to a distinct school or sect; the first, the \"Tar\u00edka-i-K\u00e1dir\u00eda,\" which traces its origin to '\u00c1bdul K\u00e1dir Jil\u00e1n\u00ed. Another, the \"Tar\u00edka-i-Chisht\u00eda,\" so called from its founder Khw\u00e1ja Mo'in-udd\u00edn Chisht\u00ed, whose tomb is at Ajmer; the third, the \"Tar\u00edka-i-N\u00e1z\u00edbband\u00eda,\" derived from a Khw\u00e1ja Bah\u00e1-udd\u00edn N\u00e1z\u00edbband\u00ed, a native of Bukh\u00e1ra. It is one of the peculiar pretensions of Say\u00edd Ahmad, that he held himself privileged to be the founder of a school of his own, to which he gave the name of the \"Tar\u00edka-i-Muhammed\u00eda.\" His book was written some time about the year 1822 A.D., and it is to be remarked, as a new feature in the history of efforts for the propagation of Muhammedanism, or for the reform of its corruptions, how extensively the emissaries of this sect have availed themselves of the press to disseminate their tenets. The \"Sir\u00e1t ul-Mustak\u00edm,\" the \"Takw\u00edst ul-Ym\u00e1n,\" the \"Hiddet ul-Momin\u00edn,\" and a little tract attached to it, named the \"M\u00fash\u00edl ul-Kab\u00edb wa'l-Bida'a;\" and two other tracts, entitled the \"Nas\u00e1hat ul-Muslim\u00edn,\" and \"Tam-b\u00edh ul-Gh\u00e1ff\u00edl\u00edn,\" have all been printed at private presses in Calcutta or at Hugl\u00ed.

When it was presented to him, he forbade its being continued; and prohibited all other historians or authors from relating the events of his life, preferring (says his panegyrist) the cultivation of inward piety to the ostentatious display of his actions. This monarch, whose reign is admired by the Muhammadans, and detested by the Hind\u00fas, after having imprisoned his father, mounted the throne of Dehl\u00ed in 1658 A.D., 1068 A.H. At this period the glory of the house of B\u00e1bar may be said to have arrived at its zenith. The empire extended from the north-west mountains of Kabul to the southern limits of Chittagong; and the kings of Golkonda and Bijapur paid tribute.

Accordingly Mahm\u00fad, to avoid the necessity of counsel from any one, had portions of it read to him as a daily observance.\"\n\nMuhammad Khan Bangash, Nawab, styled Ghazanfar Jang, a Rohela chief of the tribe of Bangash. He founded the city of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d in the name of his patron the emperor Farrukh-si\u00e1y. In the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h 1730 A.D., 1143 A.H. he was appointed governor of M\u00e1wa, but unable to cope with the Marhattas on account of their repeated incursions, he was removed in 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H., and appointed governor of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. Muhammad Kh\u00e1n having planned the reduction of the Bundelas of whom r\u00e1j\u00e1 Chatur\u00e1l was chief, entered that country in 1733 A.D., 1146 A.H. with an army, and took several places; but as he was but little acquainted with the roads, Chatur\u00e1l, with the assistance of Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1i R\u00e1o, surrounded him suddenly with an army. The naw\u00e1b, unable to combat a superior force, took refuge in the fortress of Jaitg\u00e1rah, where he was closely blockaded by the enemy for some time, when his son K\u00e1\u00e9m Jang having collected an army of the Afgh\u00e1ns, marched to Jaitg\u00e1rah and escorted his father in safety to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The imperial ministers, making a pretence of Muhammad Kh\u00e1n's ill-success, removed him from the Sub\u00e1d\u00e1r\u00ed. He died in the month of June, 1743 A.D., Jum\u00e1da I, 1156 A.H., and was succeeded in his j\u00e1gir by his son K\u00e1\u00e9m Jang, commonly called K\u00e1\u00e9m Kh\u00e1n.\n\nThe following is a list of the Naw\u00e1bs of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d:\n\nMuhammad Kh\u00e1n, Bangash.\nK\u00e1\u00e9m Jang, son of ditto.\nAhmad Kh\u00e1n, brother of K\u00e1\u00e9m Jang.\nMuzaffar Jang, son of Ahmad Kh\u00e1n.\nTafazzul Husain Kh\u00e1n.\n\nMuhammad Khan, Mir, commonly called Kh\u00e1n Kal\u00e1n, was the eldest brother of Shams-uddin Muham-mad Anka Kh\u00e1n.

He was an excellent poet, and has left a Diw\u00e1n in Persian, and another in the Turkish language. He was a native of Ghazn\u00e1vi, and therefore chose for his poetical name \"Ghaznav\u00ed.\" There is a work on Sufism entitled \"Burh\u00e1n ul-I'm\u00e1n,\" either written by him or some other Muham-mad Kh\u00e1n.\n\nMuhammad Khan Sh\u00e1ibani, vide Sh\u00e1h\u00ed Beg Kh\u00e1n Usbak.\n\nMuhammad Khan, Sultan, also called Muham-mad K\u00e1\u00e1n and Kh\u00e1n Shah\u00edd, was the eldest son of Sult\u00e1n Ghay\u00e1s-uddin Balban, king of Dehl\u00ed, who had appointed him viceroy of all the frontier provinces, viz., Mult\u00e1n, L\u00e1hor, Debalp\u00far and other districts. This prince was blest with a bright and comprehensive genius, taking great delight in learning and the company of learned men. He, with his own hand, made a choice collection of the beauties of poetry, selected from the most famous in that art. The work consisted of 20,000 complets, and was esteemed the criterion of taste. Among the learned men in the prince's court, Amir Khusro and Khw\u00e1ja Hasan bore the first rank in genius and in his esteem. The throne of Persia was at this time filled by Argh\u00fan Kh\u00e1n, the son of Ab\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, and grandson of Hal\u00e1ku Kh\u00e1n.

He was born on Friday, the 7th of August, 1702 O.S., 24th Rab' I, 1114 A.H., and crowned by the two Sayyeds after the death of Rafi-uddaula, on the 29th September, 1710 A.D., 26th Zil-Ka'da, 1115 A.H. His successor was determined by the names of his two predecessors, viz., Rafi-uddaula and Rafi-uddaula, who reigned about three months each, should be struck out of the list of kings, and that his reign should commence from the death of the emperor Farrukh-siyar. Muhammad Shah reigned 30 lunar years, 6 months and 10 days, and died one month after the battle of Sarhind which his son fought against Ahmad Shah Adil. His death took place on Thursday the 16th of April, 1748 A.D., 27th Rab' II, 1161 A.H., at the age of 47 lunar years, 1 month and 3 days. He was buried in the court before the mausoleum of Nizamuddin Aulia at Delhi, and was succeeded by his son Ahmad Shah. This emperor may be termed the last of the race of Amir Taimur who reigned in Delhi and enjoyed any power. The few princes of that sovereign's family who were raised to the throne after Muhammad Shah were mere pageants, whom the nobles of the court elevated or cast down as it suited the purposes of their ambitions.\n\nMuhammad Shah 'Adil or 'Adli, an Afghan of the tribe of Sur, whose original name was Mubarak Khan, was the son of Nizam Khan Sur, the brother of Sher Shah, and brother-in-law of Salim Shah after whose death in 1556 A.D., 961 A.H., having murdered his son Firoz, a boy of twelve years of age who had been raised to the throne, he assumed royal dignity with the title of Muhammad Shah 'Adil. He was illiterate, hated men of learning and kept company with illiterate persons like himself, whom he raised to the highest dignities in the State; among whom, one Hipu, a Bania or Indian shopkeeper, whom his predecessor Salim Shah had made superintendent of the markets, was intrusted with the whole administration of affairs. This naturally created him enemies among the Afghan chiefs, who having conspired against his life, revolted from his authority. Ibrahim Khan Sur, who had the king's sister for his wife, soon after raised a considerable army, and, getting possession of the city of Delhi, ascended the throne in 1555 A.D., 962 A.H., and assumed the ensigns of royalty. Muhammad Shah, finding himself betrayed, fled to Chunar, and contented himself with the government of the eastern provinces. He was slain in a battle fought at Munger with Bahadur Shah, king of Bengal, 1566 A.D., 963 A.H. The period of his reign at Delhi was only eleven months.\n\nMuhammad Shah Bahmani I, the second king of the Bahmani dynasty, was the son of Sultan 'Ala-ud-din Hasan Kangoh Bahmani, whom he succeeded to the throne of the Dakhin in February, 1358 A.D., 10th Zi-Kada, 776 A.H. He reigned 17 lunar years and died on the 21st of March, 1375 A.D. His son Mujahid Shah succeeded him.\n\nMuhammad Shah Bahmani II, the thirteenth Sultan of the Bahmani dynasty, was the son of Humayun Shah the Cruel. He succeeded his brother Nizam Shah to the throne of the Dakhin in July, 1463 A.D. in his ninth year; and the affairs of government were conducted, as in the reign of his late brother, by Khwaja Jahangir and Khwaja Mahmud Gawan, under the direction of the queen mother. The former was murdered after some time, and the title of Khwaja Jahangir was conferred on Mahmud Gawan, adding the duties of Wakil-us-Sultanat to his other functions.

It is said that Ahmad once intended to have shot him, but at the instant he was seized with such a pain in his arm and shoulder, that he cried out \"Muhammad will not let him die.\" He carried himself but insolently and cruelly, and was deposed and sent to prison in 1618 A.D., 1027 A.H., when 'Usm\u00e1n, his nephew, was raised to the throne.

As success in any project seldom fails to draw in imitators, Muhammad having raised himself to such a degree of power and reputation, by acting the prophet, induced others to imagine they might arrive at the same height by the same means. His most considerable competitors in the prophetic office was Musailima and Al-Awsad. Musailima pretended to be joined in commission with Muhammad, and published revelations in imitation of the Koran. He sent Muhammad a letter, offering to go halves with him, in these words: \"From Musailima, the apostle of God, to Muhammad, the apostle of God. Now, let the earth be half mine and half thine.\" But Muhammad believing himself too well established to need a partner, wrote him this answer: \"From Muhammad the apostle of God, to Musailima the liar. The earth is God's; he giveth the same for inheritance unto such of his servants as he pleaseth; and the happy issue shall attend those who fear him.\" During the few months which Muhammad lived after the setting up of this new imposture, Musailima grew very formidable; Abu Bakr, Muhammad's successor, in the second year of his reign and the 12th of Hijri (633 A.D., 12 A.H.) sent an army against him under the command of Khaliq, the son of Walid, who defeated and slew him in battle. Al-Awsad set up for himself the very year that Muhammad died; but a party, sent by Muhammad, broke into his house by night, and cut off his head.

He had acquired an extensive knowledge of pure Arabic, drawn from the best sources, and thus he has handed down in his poetical compositions. He flourished about the year 950 A.D., 339 A.H.; his father was a water-carrier in Kufa. His principal patron was Sulaiman, prince of Damascus, of the family of Hamdan. The surname of \"Al-Mutanabi,\" (the pretended prophet) was given him because he had set up for a prophet in the flat country near Sawama, where he was followed by a great multitude of the Banu Kalab and other tribes; but Lulu, governor of Emessa, having marched against him took him prisoner and dispersed his partizans. He kept Mutnabbi in confinement for a long period, and having at length brought him back to the Muslim faith, restored him liberty. He was attacked by a chief of the tribe of Asad, at the head of a troop of partizans; a combat took place in which he was killed with his son Al-Muhsed and his slave Manfik.

He ceded his territory to the English on receipt of a pension of 108,000 rupees on the 4th June, 1802 A.D. After his death, his grandson Tafazzul Husain Khan succeeded him.\n\nMusaffar Jang, whose original name was Hidayat Muhiuddin, was the favourite grandson of the celebrated Nizam ul-Mulk, the Subadar of Haidarabad. He was the son of that nobleman's daughter, and on his death, he collected an army and gave out that his grand sire had in his will not only appointed him to inherit the greatest part of his treasures, but had likewise nominated him to succeed to the government of the southern provinces. Nasir Jang, his uncle, who had taken possession of his father's wealth, was enabled to keep his father's army in pay; and this was so numerous, that the forces which Musaffar Jang had collected were not sufficient to oppose him with any probability of success. Musaffar Jang subsequently went to Arcot (Arcot) where he defeated and killed Anwaruddin Khan, the nawab of that place, by the assistance of the French in a battle fought on the 23rd of July, 1749 A.D., and was acknowledged the lawful Subadar of the Dakhin. He was, however, after some months obliged to surrender himself to Nasir Jang, who kept him in close confinement; but after the murder of Nasir Jang in December, 1750 A.D., 17th Muharram, 1164 A.H., he was again raised to the mansad by the assistance of the French. His reign was, however, of short duration, for he was not long after assassinated by the same persons who had raised him to power. His death took place on the 3rd of February, 1751 A.D., 17th Rabi' I, 1164 A.H., when Salabat Jang, the third son of the old Nasir, was placed on the mansad by the French.\n\nMusaffar Kawami, Maulana, \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0635\u0641\u0649 \u0643\u0648\u0627\u0645\u064a, vide Kawami.\n\nMusaffar Khan, Nawab, was the younger brother of Amir ul-Umra Kh\u00e1n Daur\u00e1n Abdus Samad Kh\u00e1n, by whose interest he was appointed governor of Ajmer in the reign of Farrukh-siyar, and was ordered to march with a numerous army against the Maratha chief Mah\u00e2r\u00e2o Rao Holkar, who had invaded the territories of the Mahar\u00e2ja Jaising Saw\u00e2l of Amber (now called Jaipur).

By degrees he saw himself at the head of 6,000 brave adherents, and his assistance was solicited by Shah Tahmasp II, king of Persia, whose throne was usurped by Ashraf, the chief of the Afghans. With impetuous valour, Nadir attacked and routed the enemy, and then seated his master on the throne of his ancestors at Isfahan 1730 A.D. He then pursued the flying Afghans to Kandahar, and on his return, taking advantage of the odium created by an unfavourable treaty made by Shah Tahmasp with the Turks during his absence, he deposed the king; and his son, an infant of six months, he proclaimed Shah, by the name of Abbas III. This event took place on the 16th August, 1732 A.D., 1145 A.H. In the same year, Nadir assumed to himself the sovereign power, and after having recovered all that had been taken from Persia, he concluded a peace with the Ottoman Porte in 1736 A.D. On the death of the young Shah Abbas the same year, he signified his intention of resigning his honours; but the nobles, excited by his private intrigues, invested him with the sovereign power. The historian of Nadir is careful in informing us, that the crown of Persia was placed upon the head of the conqueror exactly at 20 minutes past 8 in the morning of the 26th February, 1736 A.D., Shawwal, 1148 A.H. Nadir, now elevated to the height of his ambition, wisely saw that war was the only support of his greatness, and therefore with a numerous army he marched against India in 1739. The Mughal empire was rapidly conquered, 200,000 men were put to the sword, and a booty of one hundred and forty-five millions, in which was the imperial throne set with diamonds of an immense value, called the Peacock Throne, was brought away by him from Delhi. He latterly became capricious, proud and tyrannical, and was guilty of such cruelty, that the nobles conspired against him and assassinated him on the night of Sunday the 10th May, 1747 A.D., 10th Jumada I, 1160 A.H., after he had reigned 20 years over one of the most extensive and powerful empires of the world. He was buried at Mashhad nine days after his death. His nephew and murderer 'Ali Kuli Khan who took the title of 'Ali Shah or 'Adil Shah, succeeded him. On his accession, he put to death thirteen of the sons and grandsons of Nadir; the only descendant of the conqueror that was spared, was his grandson, Shahrukh, the son of Raza Kuli, who was 14 years of age. 'Adil Shah was soon after deprived of sight and imprisoned. After him Ibrahim his brother reigned for some time in 1748 A.D., Shahrukh in 1749 A.D., Sulaiman in 1750 A.D., Isma'il bin-Sayyad Mustafa from 1760 to 1769 A.D., and after him Karim Khan Zand and 'Ata Muhammad Khan Kajar, which see.\nNafis bin-i-Iwaz, author of the Arabic work called \"Hall-i-Mujiz ul-Kanun.\" He was a contemporary of Mirz\u00e2 Ul\u00e2gh Beg.\n\nNaftuya, or Nift\u00fbya, was called so because an offensive smell like naphtha issued from his body.

He was born on the 25th November, 1603 A.D., and died on the 13th December, 1664 A.D., 4th Jum\u00e2da I, 1075 A.H. at Ujjain. He held the rank of 5000 at the time of his death.\n\nNajabat, Mir, author of a poem called \"Gulkush\u00ee,\" on the art of wrestling, a Sharah of which has been written by Sir\u00e2z-ud-d\u00een 'Ali Kh\u00e2n 'Arr\u00fbz; and another by Mun\u00e2hi Ratan Singh of Lakhnau. Vide Naj\u00e2t (Mir).\n\nNajaf Khan, styled Am\u00eer ul-Umr\u00e2 Zulfiq\u00e2r-uddaula, was born in Persia of a family said to be related to the Safavi sovereigns of that empire, and in his infancy was, with many of his relations, a prisoner to the usurper N\u00e2dir Sh\u00e2h, who kept all the personages, any way allied to the throne, in confinement for his own security. At the request of Mirz\u00e2 Muhsin Kh\u00e2n, the brother of Naw\u00e2b Safdar Jang, who was sent on an embassy to N\u00e2dir Sh\u00e2h by Muhammad Sh\u00e2h the emperor, after his invasion of Hindust\u00e2n, Najaf Kh\u00e2n and a sister much older than himself were released. This lady married her deliverer, and Najaf Kh\u00e2n accompanied her and her husband to Dehl\u00ee. He was treated with parental affection by Mirz\u00e2 Muhsin, and at his death attached himself to Muhammad Kuli Kh\u00e2n his son, the governor of Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d, who was shortly after seized and put to death by his first cousin Naw\u00e2b Shuj\u00e2-uddaula the son of Safdar Jang. Najaf Kh\u00e2n upon this event, retired with a few followers into Bengal, and offered his services to the Naw\u00e2b Mir Kas\u00eem 'Ali Kh\u00e2n, then at war with the English, who gave him great encouragement. When Kas\u00eem 'Ali took refuge with Shuj\u00e2-uddaula, Najaf Kh\u00e2n not choosing to trust himself in the power of the latter, repaired to Bundelkhand, and served Guma\u00ee Singh, one of the chiefs of that country. Upon the flight of Shuj\u00e2-uddaula, after the battle of Buxar, he offered his services to the English, representing himself as the rightful lord of the province of Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d, was received with respectful welcome, and even put in possession of a part of it; but when peace was concluded with the Naw\u00e2b Waz\u00eer, the English discovering the falsehood of his claim, set it aside, and rewarded his attachment with a pension of two lakhs of rupees and strong recommendations to the emperor Sh\u00e2h 'Al\u00e2m. The recompense was greater than his services to the English, as he had kept up a correspondence with Shuj\u00e2-uddaula, whom he would have joined, had he been successful in the battle of Ko\u00ee\u00e2. From Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d he accompanied the emperor Sh\u00e2h 'Al\u00e2m to Dehl\u00ee in 1771 A.D., and having reduced the city of Agrah from the J\u00e2ta, he was appointed Amir-ul-'Umra with the title of Zulfiq\u00e2r-uddaula. The R\u00e2j\u00e2s of Jaipur and several other Hind\u00fb princes were his tributaries. He died on the 22nd of April, 1782 A.D., 1169 A.H., in the 49th year of his age.\n\nNajashi, vide 'Ab\u00fb'l Husain Ahmad.\n\nNajat, Mir, of Isfah\u00e2n, whose proper name was Mir 'Abdul X\u00eel, is the author of a Diw\u00e2n.

He is also, it seems, the author of another poem on the art of wrestling called \"Gulkush\u00ee.\" Some of the authors call him Mir Naj\u00e2t\u00e2b (Mir).\n\nNaji, poetical name of Muhammad Sh\u00e2kir, who lived in the reign of the emperor Muhammad Sh\u00e2h, and was contemporary with the poets W\u00e2li, H\u00e2t\u00eem, Mazm\u00fbn, and 'Ab\u00eed.\n\nNajib Khan, vide Najib-uddaula.\n\nNajib-udd\u00een Farsi, a poet of Persia who died about the year 1231 A.D., 628 A.H., and left a Diw\u00e2n.\n\nNajib-uddaula, the title of Naj\u00eeb Kh\u00e2n, a Rohela chief, and nephew of Bash\u00e2r\u00e2t Kh\u00e2n. He came into Rohelkhand during the administration of 'Ali Muhammad Kh\u00e2n. He was at first appointed to the charge of a very small party, not consisting of more than twelve horse and foot. But his courage and activity soon brought him to the notice of his patron, who entrusted him with a respectable military command, and procured for him in marriage the daughter of D\u00fbnd\u00ee Kh\u00e2n, the Rohela chief. He subsequently espoused the imperial cause, and was honourably received at Dehl\u00ee by the w\u00e2s\u00eer Gh\u00e2zi-udd\u00een Kh\u00e2n, and being soon after promoted to the command of the army, he attacked Safdar Jang, who had avowedly announced his hostile disposition to the court, and compelled him to cross the Ganges 1753 A.D., 1167 A.H. On the successful conclusion of this campaign, in which he was wounded, he received from the emperor Ahmad Shah the title of Najib-uddaula. He was created Amir-ul-'Umra to the emperor 'Alamg\u00eer II, by Ahmad Shah Abd\u00e2l\u00ee on the return to Kandah\u00e2r in 1757 A.D., 1170 A.H., but was soon after that court's departure, deprived of his office by the w\u00e2s\u00eer Gh\u00e2zi-udd\u00een Kh\u00e2n, who conferred it on Ahmad Sh\u00e2h Bangash the Naw\u00e2b of Farrukh\u00e2b\u00e2d as a return for his services. Naj\u00eeb-uddaula was present in the famous battle fought by Ahmad Sh\u00e2h Abd\u00e2l\u00ee with the Marhattas in January, 1761 A.D., and on his departure to Kandah\u00e2r, was again restored to his former situation of Amir-ul-'Umra, and was entrusted with the care of the city of Dehl\u00ee and protection of the royal family. He governed Dehl\u00ee and the few districts yet in possession of the royal family with moderation and justice till his death which took place in October, 1770 A.D., Rajab, 1184 A.H., when he was succeeded in his dominions by his son Z\u00e2bita Kh\u00e2n who continued to protect the royal family; the emperor Sh\u00e2h 'Al\u00e2m residing at Allah\u00e2b\u00e2d with the English.

He is the author of a number of excellent poems; one of which is called \"Husn wa-Ishq,\" but that held in the greatest estimation is a satire on the conquest of Golconda by 'Alamgir, 1687 A.D., in which the author lashes not only the generals, but even the emperor himself, whose conduct in destroying the Muhammedan kings of Bijapur and Golconda, while the Marhattas and other Hindu chiefs had exalted the standard of defiance, was much disapproved of by many of the zealous Musalmans. The officers and soldiers were also much disgusted by incessant wars in the Dakhin, and the very great hardships they suffered during his campaigns in that country. The book goes by the name of the author, \"Na'mat Khan Ali,\" and has no other name. It is sometimes called \"Wakayi Na'mat Khan Ali.\" He also compiled a very excellent book on Oriental Cookery.

This miscreant was an adopted son of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o II, the ex-Peshw\u00e1 of P\u00fan\u00e1 who died in December, 1852 A.D. According to Mr. Shephard's narrative of the Kahnp\u00far Mutiny, B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o died on the 28th January, 1851 A.D. Of all the butcheries in the disturbances of 1857, that enacted by this vile wretch, stands pre-eminent. Out of seven hundred and fifty living souls (all Christians) in the strength and vigour of life, few escaped to tell the horrible tale. Lieutenants Delafosse and Thomson of the 53rd N. I., Ensign Brown, 56th N. I., and two other soldiers, were the only survivors of the massacre. Three men and four women are reported to have also escaped and reached Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. They escaped the massacre in the river and were hid in Kahnp\u00far, until the arrival of General Havelock's forces. The pension of the ex-Peshw\u00e1 amounting to 8 laks of rupees per annum, was not continued to the N\u00e1nh\u00e1, and this appears to have been his principal, if not sole grievance, though he invariably maintained friendly relations with the European residents, and indeed on many occasions treated them with apparently cordial hospitality. His residence was at Bith\u00far, situated ten miles from Kahnp\u00far, where he owned an estate left him by his patron the ex-Peshw\u00e1, and he was allowed a retinue of 500 infantry and cavalry, with three guns of small calibre, and those troops were of course entirely independent of European authority. A proclamation was issued by the Governor-General in March, 1858 A.D., wherein a reward was offered of one lakh of rupees to any person, who should deliver N\u00e1nh\u00e1 Dhondh\u00fapant of Bith\u00far to the district officer commanding in any military camp or at any military post; and, in addition to the pecuniary reward, a free pardon was guaranteed to any mutineer, deserter or rebel (excepting the Naw\u00e1bs of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bareli, Banda and R\u00e1j\u00e9 of Mainp\u00far) who should so deliver up the N\u00e1nh\u00e1 S\u00e1hib.\n\nNanak, \u0646\u0627\u0646\u06a9, or N\u00e1nh\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h, the founder of the sect called Sikhs, was born in the year 1469 A.D. He was the son of a Hind\u00fa grain-merchant, and disciple of Sayyad Husain, or as some say of Kabir, and consequently a sort of Hind\u00fa deist, but his peculiar tenet was universal toleration. He maintained that devotion was due to God, that forms were immaterial, and that Hind\u00fa and Muhamm\u00e1dan worship were the same in the sight of the Deity. During his travels, N\u00e1nh\u00e1 was introduced to the emperor B\u00e1bar, before whom he is said to have defended his doctrine with great firmness and eloquence. N\u00e1nh\u00e1 died in the month of August, 1539 A.D., aged 70 years. After his sect had silently increased for more than a century, it excited the jealousy of the Mus\u00e1lm\u00e1n government, and its spiritual chief, the Gur\u00fa Arjun, was put to death in 1606 A.D., within a year after the decease of the emperor Akbar. This tyranny changed the Sikhs from inoffensive quietists into fanatical warriors. They took up arms under Harg\u00f3b\u00ednd, the son of their martyred pontiff, who inspired them with his own spirit of revenge and of hatred to their oppressors.\n\nThe following are the names of the Sikh Gurus from N\u00e1nh\u00e1k.\n\nGur\u00fa N\u00e1nh\u00e1k Sh\u00e1h, the founder of the sect, died 1639 A.D.\n\nAngad, who wrote some of the sacred books, 1552\n\nAmar\u00e1s, 1574\n\nR\u00e1m\u00e1s, who beautified Amritsar, 1581\n\nArjunmal, he compiled the \"Adi Granth,\" 1606\n\nHarg\u00f3b\u00ednd, who was the first warlike leader, 1644\n\nHar R\u00e1o, grandson of Harg\u00f3b\u00ednd, 1661\n\nHar Krishan, son of Har R\u00e1o, 1664\n\nTeigh Bah\u00e1dur, uncle of Har Krishan, 1675 put to death.\n\nGobind, son of Teigh Bah\u00e1dur.

All the power of the State had been committed to him without control, in the time of the Naw\u00e1b Ja'far 'Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. He was a treacherous enemy to the English. He was convicted of a forgery, condemned to suffer death, and was hanged at the appointed place of execution in Calcutta on the 5th August, 1775 A.D., 7th Jum\u00e1da II, 1189 A.H. His treasure and effects were given up to his son R\u00e1j\u00e9 G\u00fard\u00e1s. It is said there were fifty-two laks of rupees in money, and about the same amount in jewels and rich goods. In his house were found the seals of several eminent persons which he had forged. The Br\u00e1hm\u00e1ns of Calcutta were struck with such horror when that execution took place, that they rushed into the sacred waters of the river to purge themselves of the pollution of such a sight, and looking upon Calcutta as a second Accidama or field of blood, they crossed the river and settled at Bali, six miles from the scene of execution.

He wrote on all subjects, and some of his works are to this day standard books in Persian Universities. He was a fair Greek scholar, and made a new translation of Euclid into Arabic, wherein he proves most of the propositions, sometimes in two, three, and four ways, wholly different from the demonstrations of the Greek author. He likewise translated the Alm\u00e1j\u00e1sti, and wrote a volume of lectures or explanations notes upon it. He also wrote several works on geometry, astronomy, philosophy, theology, and dissertations on miscellaneous subjects. During the Mughal persecutions he wandered among the mountains of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and was taken captive by Alaudd\u00edn Muhammed, a descendant of Hassan Sabbah who forced him to remain with him for several years and employed him as his waz\u00edr. It was during his captivity,\nthat he wrote the most celebrated of all his treatises, a well-known and excellent little work on moral philosophy, which he styled \"Akhlaq Nasiri,\" or the morals of Nasir in complement to Nasir-uddin 'Abdu Rahim, governor of the fortress of Dez; but this flattery did not procure him his liberty, he remained in that mountainous region till he was released by H\u00e1d\u00edb Kh\u00e1n in November 1256 A.D., 654 A.H. It was Nasir-uddin that persuaded H\u00e1d\u00edb to march against Baghd\u00e1d, which was taken in 1258 A.D.\n\nThe \"Akhlaq Nasiri\" is a translation in Persian of the \"Kit\u00e1b-i-Tah\u00e1rist fil Himat Amali,\" an Arabic work by Ab\u00fa 'Al\u00ed Muhammad of Mecca. There are two other works on Sufism which he wrote, one called \"Aosaf-ul-Ashraf,\" the Praises of the Virtuous, and the other \"Bahar-ul-Ma'ani,\" the Sea of Truth.

He reigned two years and a half, and was slain on the 8th December, 1750 A.D., 17th Muhammam, 1164 A.H. by a conspiracy of his own servants, assisted by the French who surprised his camp while he was engaged in quelling a rebellion raised by his nephew, Mu'm\u00edn Jang, who had been imprisoned by him. On his death, Mu'm\u00edn Jang was placed on the masnad of the Dakh\u00edn by the conspirators; but this young prince did not long enjoy his dignity, for he was assassinated almost immediately after his accession by the same persons who had raised him to power. This event took place on the 2nd February, 1761 A.D., 17th Rab\u00ed I, 1164 A.H.

He is the author of several works, among which are the two following, viz., \"R\u00f3st\u00e1-n\u00e1m\u00e1\" in verse, and \"Kanzul-Hak\u00e1ek\" in prose. He has also left us a Diw\u00e1n consisting of 30,000 verses. He was a contemporary of Khw\u00e1ja 'Ab\u00fa'l Hasan Jurj\u00e1n\u00ed and the celebrated physician Avicenna. Some say that he was a Deist, and others considered him to be an Atheist, on which account he was persecuted by the Muhammdans, and fled from one city to another, till at last he was obliged to conceal himself among the hills of Badakhsh\u00e1n. Daudat Shah has given a very interesting account of Nasir Khusro in his T\u00e1zk\u00edr. In 1872 there was discovered among the Elia papers an Arabic work by Nasir Khusro, on the buildings and water-works of Jerusalem. He is most precise in his information. It is said, that if this work had been found a little earlier, it might have saved the Palestine exploration Committee some diggings and considerable outlay. There is also a work of the same kind in Persian called \"the Travels of Nasir Khusro,\" which he wrote in 1062 A.D., corresponding with 444 A.H.\n\nNasir Shah Purbi, \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u067e\u0648\u0631\u0628\u06cc, a lineal descendant of Shams-udd\u00edn Bh\u00e1ng\u00e1ra, was placed on the throne of Bengal in 1427 A.D., 831 A.H., after the murder of Nasir-udd\u00edn Ghul\u00e1m, who had usurped the throne for several days after the death of his master Ahmad Shah. General Briggs, in his translation, says that he reigned only two years, whereas it appears from Major Stewart's Bengal History, which seems to be correct, that he reigned 32 years, consequently his death must have happened in the year 1468 A.D., 863 A.H. He was succeeded by his son Barbk. He is also called Nasir Husain Shah as appears from an Arabic Inscription on a mosque lately discovered in the district of Hughli.\nNasir, Shaikh, \u0634\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062f\u06cc, of Akbarabad, a Musalman saint who is said to have performed a number of miracles, and was highly respected by the emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n. He died on the 7th June, 1647 A.D., 13th Jum\u00e1da I, 1057 A.H., and was buried at Agra.\n\nNasir-uddin Kabbacha or Fattah, \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u0686\u0647, ruler of Sindh. It is related in several Histories such as the \"Khulasat ul-Hik\u00e1yat,\" the \"Haj\u00ed-n\u00e1m\u00e1,\" and the History of H\u00e1d\u00ed Muhammad Kandah\u00e1ri, that the first establishment of the Muhammedan faith in the country of Sindh took place in the time of Haj\u00ed bin-Y\u00fassuf, governor of Basra, at the time when Walid the son of the Khal\u00edf 'Abdulmalik was ruler of the provinces of both Ir\u00e1q. Haj\u00ed deputed Mahm\u00fad Husain in the year 708 A.D., 87 A.H. with a select army into Mikr\u00e1u, and he subdued that country; and made converts of many of the inhabitants called Balochis. He afterwards deputed Budmin to conquer Dib\u00e1l (modern Thatta on the Indus). Budmin failed in his expedition, and lost his life in the first action. Haj\u00ed, not deterred by this defeat, resolved to follow up the enterprise by another. In consequence, in the year 712 A.D., 93 A.H., he deputed his cousin Im\u00e1d-udd\u00edn Muhammad bin-K\u00e1s\u00edm the son of Akil or Uk\u00e1i Thakafi or Sakafi with six thousand soldiers to attack Dib\u00e1l, and he in a short time conquered the place, and R\u00e1ja Dahr, the ruler of Dib\u00e1l was slain in battle. After the death of Muhammad bin-K\u00e1s\u00edm, a tribe who trace their origin from the Ans\u00e1r\u00eds, established a government in Sindh, after which the samindars of the tribe of S\u00edma\u00e1\u00ed usurped the power, and held independent rule over the kingdom of Sindh for the space of 600 years. In the course of years, the dynasty of S\u00edma\u00e1\u00ed was subverted, and the country invaded by another dynasty called S\u00edma\u00e1\u00ed, whose chief assumed the title of J\u00e1m. During the reigns of these dynasties in Sindh, the Muhammedan kings of India Proper, such as those of Ghazn\u00ed, Gh\u00f3or and Dehli, invaded Sindh, and seizing many towns, appointed Muhammedan governors over them. Among these rulers, Nasir-uddin Kabbacha asserted his independence, and caused the public prayers to be read in his name as king of Sindh. Nasir-uddin was one of the Turkish slaves of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b-udd\u00edn Muhammad Gh\u00f3or\u00ed, who made him governor of Uchcha in Mult\u00e1n about the year 1203 A.D., 600 A.H. He espoused the daughter of Sultan Kutb-udd\u00edn Esa\u00edk viceroy, and afterwards king of Dehli, after whose death in 1210 A.D., 607 A.H., having seized many of the towns subjected to the Sindh government, he reduced the territory of the S\u00edma\u00e1\u00eds to the small tract of country around Thatta, and relinquishing the allegiance to the throne of Dehli, became independent. Besides Sindh, his kingdom embraced the provinces of Mult\u00e1n, Kohr\u00e1n and Surat\u00ed. He was twice attacked by T\u00e1j-udd\u00edn Elduz of Gharn\u00ed, but he successfully repelled both these invasions. In 1225 A.D., Shams-udd\u00edn Alt\u00edmah, king of Dehli, made several attempts to remove him from his government, and even marched for that purpose as far as Uchcha, when Nasir-uddin having no hopes of eventually repelling the arm of the Dehli monarch, placed his family and personal attendants with his treasure, in boats, and endeavoured to occupy a contiguous island; when a storm coming on, the boat foundered, and everyone perished. This monarch reigned in Sindh and Mult\u00e1n for a period of 22 years. In the latter end of the reign of Muhammad Tughl\u00e1k of Dehli, Sindh owned allegiance to that monarch; nevertheless, occasionally taking advantage of local circumstances, the Sindh\u00eds contrived, for a considerable period, to shake off their allegiance.

His mother's name was Mann\u00fa Begam. He died about the month of May, 1766 A.D., Zil-hijjah, 1179 A.H., and was succeeded by his brother Saif-uddaula.\n\nNizam-ul-Mulk Muhammad, (the son of 'Ali Sayyad Jumaidi, to whom the J\u00e1ma-ul-Hikayat is dedicated), was the general of Shams-uddin Altamsh, king of Delhi. He was living in 622 A.H.\n\nNizam-ul-Mulk, a justly celebrated minister of Sultan Alp Arsalan, second king of the Saljuqids, and afterwards of his son Malikshah; to his virtue and ability is attributed the success and prosperity of their reign. After an administration of 30 years, the fame of the wazir, his wealth and even his services, were transformed into crimes. This venerable statesman, at the age of 39 years, was dismissed by his master, accused by his enemies, and was stabbed by an assassin, who was a follower of Hasan Sabbah, the Old Man of the mountain, on Friday night the 16th of October, 1092 A.D., Ramaz\u00e1n, 485 A.H. at a place called Nah\u00e1wad. His body was carried to Isfahan where he was interred with great pomp. It is said that the assassin was suborned against him by Malikshah, who was fatigued to see him live so long. The Sultan survived him 35 days only. Nizam-ul-Mulk appears to be the author of the work, entitled \"Siyar-ul-Mulk.\"\n\nNizam-ul-Mulk, entitled 'Asaf Jah, whose original name was Ch\u00edn Kulich Kh\u00e1n, was the son of Ghazi-uddin Kh\u00e1n Firoz Jang a favourite officer of the emperor Xlamgir, under which monarch he also distinguished himself. In the reign of the emperor Farrukh-siyar, he held the government of Moradabad and was afterwards appointed governor of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, which province he restored to a flourishing condition; but the reputation he acquired rendered him an object of jealousy to the two brothers, Sayyad 'Abdullah Kh\u00e1n and Husain 'Ali Kh\u00e1n, who wished to remove him to another quarter less favourable to his interest than the frontier of the Dakhin; but Nizam-ul-Mulk not willing to quit his post, excused himself, and resolved to seek an independent power in the Dakhin. The disturbed state of that country gave him a pretence for raising troops, and turned his attention to the conquest of the Dakhin. By intrigue and money he obtained possession of the fort of Asirgarh about the year 1717 A.D., and procured the junction of several officers of the province. He was pursued from Hindust\u00e1n by the force under Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n and another under 'Alam 'Ali Kh\u00e1n, both of whom he defeated and slew in battle in April, 1720 A.D., and at last remained without a rival in the Dakhin. In the reign of Muhammad Shah, after the death of the two Sayyads, he was invited to court by that emperor; and on his arrival at Delhi, the high office of wizarat was conferred on him, but Nizam-ul-Mulk being soon disgusted with\nthe state of things at court, sent in his resignation, and marched off for the Dakhin, and though he continued to send honorary presents, on fixed occasions to the emperor, he thenceforth conducted himself, in other respects, as an independent prince, and governed the provinces of the Dakhin for 30 years with great ability and success. He was present in the battle which took place between Muhammad Shah and N\u00e2dir Shah, and is the progenitor of the present Niz\u00e2ms of Haiderabad. He died on the 22nd May, 1748 A.D., 4th Jum\u00e2da II, 1161 A.H., thirty-seven days after the death of the emperor Muhammad Shah, aged 104 lunar years, and was buried at Burhanpur near the tomb of Shah Ghazi-ud-din Gharib. He left behind him six sons, viz., Gh\u00e2zi-uddin, Nas\u00eer Jang, Salabat Jang, Niz\u00e2m 'Ali, Bas\u00eelar Jang and Atiq-ud-din Ali, and was succeeded in the government of the Dakhin by the second, Mir Ahmad surnamed Nas\u00eer Jang, who was present at Burhanpur when his father died; the eldest Gh\u00e2zi-uddin Khan then residing at Delhi in the office of Amir-i-Umra. Nas\u00eer Jang was assassinated in December, 1760 A.D., and Muzaffar Jang, a grandson of Niz\u00e2m-ul-Mulk was placed on the throne, and soon after assassinated in February, 1761 A.D.; Salabat Jang, by the influence of the French, was then proclaimed and reigned until 1761 A.D., when he was imprisoned, and in 1763 A.D. put to death by his brother Niz\u00e2m 'Ali, who ascended the throne and reigned until the 6th August, 1803 A.D., when he died, and was succeeded by his eldest son Mirz\u00e2 Sikandar Jah. Sikandar Jah died on the 23rd May, 1829 A.D., and was succeeded by his son Mir Farhundah 'Ali Kh\u00e2n, the present Niz\u00e2m (1858). Niz\u00e2m-ul-Mulk appears to be the author of a Diw\u00e2n which was found in the Library of Tip\u00fb Sult\u00e2n called \"Diw\u00e2n 'Asaf Niz\u00e2m-ul-Mulk.\"\n\nNiz\u00e2m-ul-Mulk Bahr\u00ee, \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u06cc, the father of Ahmad Niz\u00e2m Sh\u00e2h Bahr\u00ee who was the first king of the Niz\u00e2m Sh\u00e2h\u00ee dynasty. Niz\u00e2m-ul-Mulk was originally a Brahman of Bijanagar, but being taken prisoner in his infancy by the army of Sultan Ahmad Sh\u00e2h Bahmani, was made a Musulm\u00e2n, and was educated as one of the royal slaves. He finished his education under the same tutor with the king's eldest son Sultan Muhammad, and became eminently learned in Persian and Arabic literature. On the accession of Sultan Muhammad II to the throne of the Dakhin in 1463 A.D., he was raised to the rank of thousand, and the charge of the royal falconry was entrusted to him, on which account he was called Bahr\u00ee, i.e., a falconer. By degrees he rose to the highest honours and was appointed governor of Tilang\u00e2na. On the death of Muhammad Shah in 1482 A.D., he by his will became first minister to his son Sultan Mahm\u00fbd II, who added Bir and other districts to his jagir. This he committed to his son Malik Ahmad, who took up his residence at Khaibar and employed himself diligently in the affairs of his government, and after his father's death set up a separate dynasty in the Dakhin called Niz\u00e2m Sh\u00e2h\u00ee, the capital of which was Ahmadnagar. Niz\u00e2m-ul-Mulk who had the sole power of the administration in his hands, latterly paid little or no regard for the king's authority, was murdered by the orders of the Sultan about the year 1486 A.D., 891 A.H., or some time afterwards.\n\nNiz\u00e2m-ul-Mulk Mahm\u00fbd, \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f, the son of Ab\u00ee Sa'id Junaidi, a general and waz\u00eer of Shams-ud-din Altamah, king of Dehli.

He travelled much, and in his travels he met Sa'd\u00ee and other distinguished men. Towards the end of his life he retired from the world and lived by agriculture.

His reign was marked by extraordinary vicissitudes of fortune. He was contemporary with Subukt\u00een, a chief of high reputation, who had established a principality at Gh\u00e2z\u00e2ni. He died in 997 A.D., Rajab, 387 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Mans\u00fbr II.\n\nNur 'Ali Shah, \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0634\u0627\u06c1, a leader of the Suf\u00ee sect and disciple of Ma's\u00fbm 'Ali Shah, is supposed to have been poisoned, and died on the 3rd June, 1800 A.D., 10th Muhrarram, 1216 A.H., close to the grave of the prophet Jonas, within a league of Mousal, vide Mas\u00fbm 'Ali Shah.\n\nNuri, \u0646\u0648\u0631\u064a, poetical appellation of K\u00e2si Nur-uddin of Isfah\u00e2n who died in 1592 A.D., 1000 A.H., and left a Diw\u00e2n.\n\nNuri, \u0646\u0648\u0631\u064a, a poet who is the author of the \"Maul\u00fbd N\u00fbria,\" in verse, which he dedicated to Sultan 'Ab\u00fb'l Muzaffar Ya'k\u00fbb Bah\u00e2dur Kh\u00e2n, commonly called Ya'k\u00fbb Bog.

She had attracted the notice of the prince Sultan Salim (afterwards Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer); but was, at the suggestion of his father the emperor Akbar, in order to withdraw the lady from the attentions of the prince, married to Sher Afgh\u00e2n Kh\u00e2n, a young Persian lately come into the service, and to whom Akbar gave a jag\u00eer in Bengal. After the death of his father, Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer appointed Kutb-uddin Kh\u00e2n his foster-brother the son of Shaikh Salim Ch\u00e2hi, as governor of Bengal with the intention that he might procure for him the object of his passion. Kutb-uddin Kh\u00e2n on his arrival at Bur\u00fbwan was slain by Sher Afgh\u00e2n Kh\u00e2n, who was himself despatched by Kutb-uddin's attendants. Nur Jahan was seized and sent as a prisoner to Delhi, and was at first placed by the emperor among the attendants of his mother, but he subsequently married her in the sixth year of his reign 1610 A.D., 1019 A.H., changed her name, which was Mohr-un-Nis\u00e2, into Nur Jah\u00e2n (the light of the world), and raised her to honours such as had not before been enjoyed by the consort of any king in India. From this period her ascendancy knew no bounds; the emperor took no step without consulting her; and on every affair in which she took an interest, her will was law. A circumstance so uncommon in an Asiatic government is thus recorded on the coins of that period. \"By order of the emperor Jah\u00e2ng\u00eer, gold acquired a hundred times additional value by the name of the empress Nur Jah\u00e2n.\" Nur Jahan's sister Ghay\u00e2t or Ayas was made prime minister with the title of Ya'tmad-uddaula; and her two brothers were raised to the first rank of 'Umra, by the titles of Ya'tmad Kh\u00e2n,\nand 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n. One of the accomplishments by which she captivated Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, is said to have been her facility in composing extemporary verses. After the death of her husband, she was treated with much respect and allowed a stipend of \u00a3250,000 a year. She survived Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr eighteen years, and died aged 72 in 1645 A.D., 1055 A.H., at L\u00e1h\u00f3r, where she was buried in the mausoleum of her husband close to his tomb; some say, near the tomb of her brother 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n on the banks of the R\u00e1wi, at L\u00e1h\u00f3r.

His short reign of two years was troubled by continual feuds among the Muml\u00edk chieftains, and attempts on the part of the Ayy\u00fab\u00ede princes of Syria to recover the lost sway of their family in Egypt; and the apprehension of an irruption of the Mughals under Hal\u00e1k\u00fa, who had taken Baghdad and destroyed the Khil\u00e1f\u00e1t, shewed the necessity of substituting a ruler of matured years and experience.

At the death of his father, who was murdered by his own Maml\u00faks at the siege of Jubb\u00e1r, 1146 A.D., 541 A.H., N\u00far-udd\u00edn hastening to Aleppo with the signet of the deceased prince secured the possession of that city and of his father's Syrian dominions; while Mesopotamia, with Mousal for a capital, fell to the lot of the elder brother Saif-udd\u00edn; and the feeble attempts of Alp Arsal\u00e1n, a prince of the house of Salj\u00fak, to assert his ancestral claims to the dominion of these provinces, were easily frustrated by the combined power of the two brothers. The earliest exploits of the reign of N\u00far-udd\u00edn were in continuance of the Holy War which his father had assiduously waged against the Latin Christians of Palestine: Josceline de Courtenay, whose capital of Edessa had been taken by Zangi a few years previous, was signally repulsed in an attempt to recover it, and the Christian inhabitants, who had aided the enterprise, were put to the sword without mercy by command of N\u00far-udd\u00edn who even levelled the fortifications of the town to prevent its ever again becoming a bulwark to the kingdom of Jerusalem. The recovery of this important fortress was the avowed object of the second Crusade, undertaken 1148 A.D., 543 A.H., under Louis VII of France and the emperor Conrad: but of the mighty hosts which they led from Europe, only a miserable and dispirited remnant escaped the arrows of the Sulj\u00fak\u00ed Turks in their march through Anatolia to Palestine, the project of retaking Edessa was abandoned as hopeless, the siege of Damascus, which was attacked by the crusading monarchs in conjunction with Baldwin III of Jerusalem, was foiled when on the eve of success by the address with which the minister of the Muslim prince Mujir-udd\u00edn fomented the mutual jealousies of the Christian leaders; and this vast armament, which if properly directed might have overwhelmed the rising power of N\u00far-udd\u00edn, only served by its failure to extend and confirm it. Resuming the offensive immediately after the departure of the crusaders, he invaded the territory of Antioch, and in a pitched battle (27th June, 1149 A.D.), routed and slew the prince Raymond, whose head was sent as a trophy to the Khal\u00edf at Baghd\u00e1d; and though he sustained a severe defeat the following year from his ancient opponent Josceline de Courtenay, who surprised his camp, the disgrace was amply compensated by the captivity of that active leader, who was soon after seized while hunting by a marauding party of Turkm\u00e1ns, and died in confinement, while the remaining dependencies of Edessa, the fortress of Ainstab, Tolbashor, Ravendan, &c., fell almost without resistance into the power of N\u00far-udd\u00edn, whose dominions now included the whole of Northern Syria. Mujir-udd\u00edn was still the nominal ruler of Damascus and the southern portion, but the government was entirely in the hands of his waz\u00edr Mo'in-udd\u00edn An\u00e1r, whose daughter N\u00far-udd\u00edn had married; and after the death of this able minister, the inhabitants, alarmed at the capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III in 1153 A.D., and dreading an attack from the Christians, voluntarily offered their allegiance to N\u00far-udd\u00edn (1154) as the price of his protection. The weak Mujir-udd\u00edn resigned his power, and sought an asylum at the court of the Khal\u00edf of Baghd\u00e1d, which then seems to have been the usual retreat of deposed princes; while N\u00far-udd\u00edn, the circuit of whose realms now encompassed on all sides by land the Latin territories in Palestine, and extended to the frontiers of the Fatimite possessions...\nin Egypt, fixed his capital at Damascus, which he raised from the ruinous state in which it had been left by an earthquake, and adorned with mosques, fountains, colleges, and hospitals. The death of Baldwin III in 1162 A.D., released Nuruddin from the ablet of his antagonists, his brother and successor Almaric, or Amory, being far inferior to Baldwin both in prowess and abilities. Potamia, ruled by the Sultan's nephew, acknowledged his supremacy as head of the family; but was now, by his officers' absolute mastery of Egypt, his name was visited with that of the Khalif Mustan of Baghdad in all the mosques throughout his dominions, and even in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, which T\u00f6rfan Shah, brother of S\u00e1lih-uddin, had made dependencies of Egypt. But the power and glory of Nuruddin had now attained their highest pitch, the three remaining years of his life were unmarked by any memorable achievement, and disquieted by the forebodings of the future downfall of his house by the ambition of S\u00e1lih-uddin, who, though still ostensively acting as his lieutenant, and making public professions of loyalty and obedience, had in fact become independent master of Egypt, and eluded or disregarded all the orders of his nominal sovereign. Nuruddin was preparing to march into Egypt to reduce or expel his refractory vassal, when an attack of quinsy terminated his life at Damascus after a prosperous reign of 27 years on the 26th of May, 1173 A.D., 21st Shawwal, 569 A.H. His son Malik-us-S\u00e1lih Isma'il, a youth, 11 years old, succeeded to the titular sovereignty of his extensive dominions, but was speedily stripped, by S\u00e1lih-uddin, of Damascus and the greater part of Syria, and died 8 years afterwards, reduced to the sovereignty of Aleppo and its dependencies.\n\nNuruddin Muhammad, Mirza, son of 'Al\u00e1-uddin Muhammad, the son of Khwaja Husain.

The accounts given by Eastern and Western authors, of the successes of this king in his invasions of the Roman empire, differ but very little. Some of the former have falsely asserted that he took an emperor of the Romans prisoner; and they have all, with a partiality that, in national historians writing of this monarch, seems almost excusable, passed over the few reverses which his arms sustained. But the disgraceful peace which the emperor Justinian purchased at the commencement of the reign of Nousherwan, the subsequent war, the reduction of all Syria, the capture of Antioch, the unopposed progress of the Persian monarch to the shores of the Mediterranean, his conquest of Iberia, Calchos, and the temporary establishment of his power on the banks of the Phasis, and on the shores of the Euxine, are facts not questioned by his enemies. They, however, assert, that his genius, as a military leader, even when his fortune was at the highest, was checked by Belisarius, who was twice sent to oppose his progress; and whose success, considering his want of means, and the character of the court he served, was certainly wonderful. In all the negotiations which took place...\nplace between the emperor Justinian and Nousherwan, the latter assumed the tone of a superior. His lowest servants were treated, at the imperial court, in a manner calculated to inflame the pride, and raise the insolence of a vain and arrogant nation; and the impressions which this conduct must have made, were confirmed by the agreement of the Roman emperor to pay 30,000 pieces of gold; a sum which could have been of no importance to Nousherwan, but as it showed the monarch of the Western world in the rank of one of his tributaries. In a second war with the Roman emperors Justin and Tiberius, Nousherwan, who though 80 years of age, still led his armies, experienced some reverses of fortune: but the perseverance and valour of the aged sovereign were ultimately rewarded by the conquest of Dara and the plunder of Syria, 572 A.D. He died after a prosperous reign of 48 years about the year 579 A.D., and was succeeded by his son Hurmuz IV.\n\nMuhammad, who was born during the reign of Nousherwan, 571 A.D., used to boast of his fortune, in being born when so just a king reigned.

He was murdered by the Raja of Jaipur while engaged in the congenial occupation of lifting some of the Raja's property. He was succeeded by his son Damaji who was an unworthy representative of his illustrious sire. He had the audacity to declare open war against the Peshwa while the Peshwa was unencumbered with any other quarrel, and as the result of this unequal contest, he lost half of his possessions, and was forced to hold the other half himself as a fief from the Peshwa.

But they were the heirs to the throne, and it was sought to make them the victims of an usurpation. The British Government was horrified at this iniquity and they stepped in to prevent it. Afterwards when the British were engaged in their fresh struggle with the Peshwa, Baroda sided with us. The Maratha confederacy was broken up, and in the final settlement, the Gaikowar received a large accession of territory. Anand Rao died in 1819 A.D., and was succeeded by Saiji Rao.

The R\u00e1j\u00e9 of Sit\u00e1ra, R\u00e1mkr\u00edj\u00ed, a weak prince, being upon the throne, it was concerted between the two principal officers of the state, B\u00e1i\u00ed R\u00e1o the Peshwa, and R\u00e1ghoji Bhosla, the Bakhshi or Commander-in-Chief, to divide the dominions of their master. In consequence of this arrangement, the former assumed the government of the western provinces, continuing at the ancient capital of P\u00fana; the latter took the eastern, and fixed his residence at Nagpur, a principal city in the province of Ber\u00e1r; whilst R\u00e1mkr\u00edj\u00ed was confined to the fortress of Sit\u00e1ra, the Peshwa administering the government in his name. Hence the distinction between the Marhattas of P\u00fana and Ber\u00e1r. R\u00e1ghoji was the son of Vimb\u00f3ji who was killed in Audh during the lifetime of his father Parsoj\u00ed, who was Bakhshi under his brother S\u00e1hoj\u00ed the son of Sambhoj\u00ed the son of Sewj\u00ed the founder of the Marhatta empire. R\u00e1ghoji Bhosla died in 1749 or\nRaghoji\n\n1753 A.D., and transmitted his government to his son J\u00e1noji, who dying in 1772 A.D., left his inheritance to his nephew and adopted son Raghoji Bhosla II, the son of his younger brother Madh\u00f3ji. This occasioned a contention between J\u00e1noji's brother S\u00e1moji and Madh\u00f3ji. The former claimed the government in the right of priority of birth, and the latter as father and guardian of the adopted child. They were accordingly engaged in hostility until the death of S\u00e1moji or Sabhoji, who was killed in an engagement with his brother on the 27th of January, 1775 A.D. From that period the government of Ber\u00e1r was held by Madh\u00f3ji or Madh\u00faji Bhosla.\n\nBhosla R\u00e1j\u00e1s of N\u00e1gpur or Ber\u00e1r.\n\n| Name                        | Year |\n|-----------------------------|------|\n| Raghoji Bhosla I            | 1753 |\n| J\u00e1noji or R\u00e1noji            | 1772 |\n| Madh\u00f3ji                      | 1788 |\n| Raghoji Bhosla II           | 1816 |\n| Parsoji (strangled by Apa Sahib) | 1816 |\n| M\u00fad\u00f3ji (Apa Sahib) acknowledged by the English in 1816 and deposed in 1818 | |\n| Part\u00e1p Singh N\u00e1r\u00e1yan grandson of Raghoji Bhosla put on the throne | 1818 |\n| Raghoji Bhosla III          | 1853 |\n\nRaghoji Bhosla II, succeeded his father Madh\u00f3ji Bhosla in the government of Ber\u00e1r or N\u00e1gpur in May, 1788 A.D. and died on the 22nd of March, 1816 A.D., when his son Parsoji succeeded him.\n\nRaghunath Shah, of the Mandla district, who was a direct descendant of the eldest branch of the Gond dynasty, was executed in 1857 A.D. for rebellion, and his estates confiscated.

He died in 1853 A.D., not only without heirs but without any male relations who could support a legitimate claim to the R\u00e1j; thereupon the Governor General quietly annexed that large country to the Company's dominions.\n\nRaghunath Rao, commonly called Ragh\u00f3b\u00e1, a Marhatta chief who was at one time much connected with the English. He was the son of B\u00e1l\u00ed R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1 I, and father of the last Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1l\u00ed R\u00e1o II, and paternal uncle of M\u00e1dh\u00f3 R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1 II. He usurped the Peshw\u00e1ship after the death of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan R\u00e1o, youngest son of B\u00e1l\u00ed R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1. On the death of B\u00e1l\u00ed R\u00e1o, who left two sons M\u00e1dh\u00f3 R\u00e1o and N\u00e1r\u00e1yan R\u00e1o, both minors, the power of the state was for some years wielded by his brother Raghunath as regent. M\u00e1dh\u00f3 R\u00e1o was enabled to take the reins of government into his own hands after some time, but died in 1772 A.D., and was succeeded by his brother N\u00e1r\u00e1yan R\u00e1o. He was soon after murdered in consequence of a plot which Ragh\u00f3b\u00e1 had formed against him. Ragh\u00f3b\u00e1 was acknowledged Peshw\u00e1 after his death; but it appeared soon after that the widow of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan R\u00e1o was with child. The ministers proclaimed the event during Ragh\u00f3b\u00e1's absence. He was defeated and fled to Surat.\n\nRahim Beg, Mirza, of Sardh\u00e1na, author of a small work on Persian and Arabic poetry, entitled \"Makh\u00e1n Shu\u00e1ra\" which he composed in the year 1852 A.D., 1268 A.H. It is also called \"Wasilat-ush-Shu\u00e1ra.\"\n\nRahia, one of the earliest professors of Muhammadanism, although he was not present at the battle of Badar.

At this period the princes of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, from Bengal to Sind, including M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and Gujrat, had been subdued by the victorious arms of the Governor Akbar, and R\u00e1j\u00e9 'Ali Kh\u00e1n, in order to avoid so unequal a contest, dropped the title of R\u00e1j\u00e9, which his brother had assumed, and wrote a letter to Akbar begging that he might be considered as his vassal and tributary. In order to convince him of his sincerity, he sent him many rich and valuable presents. After the death of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Shih II, king of Ahmadnagar in the year 1598 A.D., 1004 A.H., the prince Mirz\u00e1 Mur\u00e1d and Mirz\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n the son of Bair\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, marched for the purpose of subduing the Dakhin. R\u00e1j\u00e9 'Ali Kh\u00e1n accompanied them, and was killed with many officers of distinction, by the explosion of a powder tumbrel, in the famous battle fought between Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n and Suheil Kh\u00e1n, general of the Ahmadnagar forces. His death happened on the 26th January 1697 A.D., 18th Jum\u00e1da II, 1005 A.H. after he had reigned 21 years. His body was carried to Burhanpur, where he was buried with due honours.

He reigned seven years and died in 1392 A.D., 796 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Jitmal who became a Mus\u00e1l-m\u00e1n, and assumed the name of Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn.\n\nRaja Ram, the brother of Sambh\u00e1ji the Marhatta chief by another mother. He succeeded his brother in July 1689 A.D. On his accession Sambh\u00e1ji in April 1680, was seized and sent to reside in one of the forts of the Karnatic, with a decent appanage, but without any power in the government, and there he continued to reside till the death of his brother (July 1689) when he was acknowledged his successor. In his time the fortress of Sit\u00e1ra was taken by 'Alamgir on the 21st April, 1700 A.D., 13th Zil-K\u00e1'da 1111 A.H., but before it fell, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ram died of the small-pox the same year at Jhinji. He was succeeded by his son Karan, who survived him but a few days, when another son of his, named Seiwa an\ninfant only two years old was put on the masnad under the guardianship of R\u00e1m Ch\u00e1nd Pandit and regency of his mother, T\u00e1r\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed. But when, after the death of 'Alamg\u00edr, R\u00e1j\u00e9 S\u00e1h\u00fa or Sah\u00edj II, was released from confinement, he was put aside, and Sah\u00edj was crowned at Sit\u00e1ra in March 1708 A.D.\n\nList of R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\nR\u00e1j\u00e1s of Berar or N\u00e1gpur, vide Raghoj\u00ed Bhosla I.\nof Chittour and N\u00e1gpur, vide R\u00e1n\u00e1 Sanka or M\u00e1ldeo R\u00e1o.\nof Gw\u00e1l\u00e1r, vide R\u00e1noji Scindia.\nof Jaipur or Jaingar, vide Bih\u00e1ri Mal or Sandhal downa.\nof M\u00e1lw\u00e1 or Indor of the Holkar family, vide Mah\u00e1ir R\u00e1o I.\nof M\u00e1rw\u00e1r or Jodhpur, vide Jodh\u00e1 R\u00e1o and M\u00e1ldeo R\u00e1o.\nof Bharpt\u00f3r, vide Ch\u00faraman J\u00e1t.\nof Sit\u00e1ra, vide Sah\u00edj.\nof Indor vide Mah\u00e1ir R\u00e1o Holkar I.\n\nRaj Indar Goshain, \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u06af\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0646, chief of a sect of Hind\u00fa ascetics who used to go about stark naked.

In his time the fort of Chittour was demolished by order of the emperor 'Alamg\u00edr.

Neither the precise period, nor the causes which led him to abjure the religion of his fathers now appear: but he steadily denounced idol-worship, and suffered on this account great persecution from the Brahmins. On quitting the place of his nativity in 1760 A.D., he wandered over the country, and eventually repaired to Bhilw\u00e1ra, in the Udaipur territory, where, after a residence of two years, Bh\u00edm Singh, R\u00e1n\u00e1 or prince of that state, was urged by the priests to harass him to a degree which compelled him to abandon the town. The chief of Sh\u00e1hpura offered the wanderer an asylum at his court, where he arrived in the year 1767 A.D., but he does not seem to have settled there permanently until two years later, from which time, it may be proper to date the institution of the sect. R\u00e1m Charan expired in April, 1798 A.D., in the 79th year of his age, and his corpse was reduced to ashes in the great temple at Sh\u00e1hpura. R\u00e1m Charan composed 36,250 Sabds or hymns, each containing from five to eleven verses. He was succeeded in the spiritual directorship by R\u00e1mj\u00e1n, one of his twelve disciples. This person died at Sh\u00e1hpura in 1809 A.D., after a reign of 12 years 2 months and 6 days. He composed 18,000 Sabds. The third hierach Dulh\u00e1 R\u00e1m succeeded him and died in 1824 A.D. He wrote 10,400 Sabds, and about 4000 S\u00e1ki, or lyric poems, in praise of men eminent for virtue not only of his own faith, but among Hind\u00fas, Muhammedans and others. After him Charan D\u00e1s assumed the g\u00e1ddi, and died in 1831 A.D. He is said to have composed 1000 Sabds, but would not permit their being committed to paper. N\u00e1r\u00edy\u00e1n D\u00e1s the fourth in descent from R\u00e1m Charan, succeeded him and was living in 1835 A.D.

He obtained an appointment in the Customs Department at Benares which gave him 1,200 rupees a year. He is the author of several Masnav\u00eds, such as \"Muhi-i-Ishk,\" \"Muhi-i-Dard,\" \"Muhi-i-Gh\u00e1'm,\" &c. He also translated some books on mysticism from the Sanskrit, as \"Muhi-ul-Hak\u00edk,\" \"Muhi-ul-As\u00e1r,\" \"Gulsh\u00e1n-i-Ma'rif\u00e1t,\" \"Muhi Ma'rif\u00e1t\" &c.\n\nRamji, \u0631\u0627\u0645\u062c\u06cc, son of R\u00e1j\u00e9 Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s the uncle of the celebrated R\u00e1j\u00e9 M\u00e1n Singh. He, together with his two brothers, Bij\u00e1\u00ed R\u00e1m and Say\u00e1m R\u00e1m, was crushed to death under the feet of an elephant by order of the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr in the early part of his reign.\n\nRam Mohan Rae, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0648\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u0621, afterwards R\u00e1j\u00e9 R\u00e1m Mohan R\u00e1e, a Br\u00e1hman of a respectable family in Bengal, whose birth and mission are briefly stated in Mauder's Biographical Treasury, was early celebrated for his precocious genius, high linguistic attainments, and other natural gifts which in his after-life procured for him the reputation of a reformer. Among several other reforms, the degenerate state of Hind\u00faism demanded his earliest attention, and he with his wonted zeal and assiduity, took upon himself to introduce a reform which at the risk of his purse and reputation, he succeeded in a great measure in affecting among his former co-religionists. His object was to reconstruct and varnish the old Hind\u00faism, and not to abandon it altogether as some of the modern pseudo-reformers propose. He picked up morals and precepts from the Ved\u00e1s, Duss\u00e1ns and Upanish\u00e1ds, which he thought most appropriate and instructive; but never accepted them as revelations. He likewise borrowed rules and precepts from other religions, but more particularly from Christianity. His originality of mind, his natural logical powers, his mastery of mental and moral philosophy, and above all his ardent desire to establish the true knowledge of God among his countrymen, made him discard all the prevailing religions of the world as revelations. When in England, the R\u00e1j\u00e9 always\nattended the Unitarian church and much approved of its doctrines. He embarked for England and arrived at Liverpool on the 8th April, 1831 A.D. and died at Stapleton Grove near Bristol, while on a visit to that country, for the purpose of giving information and of promoting the interests of his countrymen, by advocating more liberal intercourse with India. After his death his followers in Bengal strictly adhered to the faith, and multiplied in number by thousands. The works of Sir W. Hamilton and Bishop Berkeley have also become their guides in points of philosophy. In a word the Brahmins are not idolaters, as considered by some, nor infidels as supposed by many. They are rather the religious and enlightened people of the age as they consider themselves. Raja Ram Mohan translated the Upanishads of the Yajur Veda according to the Comment of Shankar Acharya, into English, establishing the unity and comprehensibility of the Supreme Being, whose worship alone can tend to eternal beatitude. A translation of the Vedant (an abridgment of all the sacred writings) in Hindustani and Bengali, was made by this Hindu philosopher and philanthropist. The Raja also published an abstract of it in English. His tomb is in Arno's Vale cemetery in Bristol.\n\nRamraj, \u0631\u0627\u062c, a Raj\u00e1 of Bij\u00e1nagar or Bij\u00e1inagar, who was slain in battle against the four Muhammadan princes of the Dakhin. This celebrated action took place on the banks of the Krishna river on Friday the 26th of January 1656 A.D., 9th Jam\u00e1da II, 972 A.H. It cost Ramraj his life, and ended in the defeat of the Hindu army with the loss of nearly one hundred thousand men. Ramraj being defeated, was taken prisoner and brought before Husain Nizam Shah who ordered his head to be struck off, and caused it to be placed on the point of a long spear to be announced to the army; and afterwards kept at Bijapur as a trophy.\n\nRam Narayan, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0646\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0646, Raja, was deputy governor of Patna in the time of Mir Ja'far 'Ali Kh\u00e1n the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal. Mir Kasim 'Ali, on his accession to the masnad in 1760 A.D., 1174 A.H., having detected embezzlements of large sums from the revenues, the j\u00e1girs, and pay of the troops, confiscated his effects. About seven lac of rupees in money and goods were found in his house, and nearly the same sum was recovered from persons to whom it had been entrusted by himself and his women. He was then kept in confinement with several others on suspicion. In August 1763 A.D., Muharram, 1177 A.H., a few days before Mir Kasim 'Ali's defeat by the English on the banks of the Udra nala, he commanded these persons to be put to death, and Raj\u00e1 Ram Narayan was drowned in the Ganges with a bag of sand tied round his neck. Ram Narayan was a Persian scholar and wrote poetry in Persian and Urdu, having adopted the word \"Maus\u00fal\" for his poetical name.\n\nRamraja, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0631\u0627\u062c, succeeded S\u00e1hji II as Raj\u00e1 of Sit\u00e1ra in December, 1749 A.D. He was the adopted son of S\u00e1hji and grandson of T\u00e1r\u00e9 B\u00e1\u00ed. He died on the 12th December, 1777 A.D., having a short time before his death adopted Abba S\u00e1hib the son of Trimbakji Bhoela.

He poisoned Bakhat Singh his uncle, and usurped the throne. At his death 1773 A.D., disorganization prevailed in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, promoted by the Marhattas, who then got footing in Rajp\u00fatana, and by the evils generated by its feudal institutions. At Tonga, however, the Rathors defeated De Boigne, the celebrated general of Scindia; but they were crushed at the subsequent battles of P\u00e1jan and Mairta by the reigning prince Bijai Singh.\n\nRam Singh I, \u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u06af \u0627\u0648\u0644, Raj\u00e1 of Jaipur, he was honoured after the death of his father Raj\u00e1 Jai Singh I, by the emperor 'Alamgir in 1656 A.D. with the title of Raj\u00e1, and put in possession of his father's territories.

He rebelled against the emperor Jah\u00e1ngir for some time, but was at last compelled by force of arms to acknowledge fealty to the throne of Delhi. The emperor ordered to be cut in marble, the images of Amar Singh and his son Karan, which, when finished and brought to him, he took to Agra and placed in the garden-seat, called Jh\u00e9roka Darsh\u00e1n, where the people assembled every morning to pay their respects to the emperor.

His son Udai Singh is the founder of the capital Udaipur. The Udaipur chief is, in the estimation of all the Hind\u00e9\ndynasties of India, per excellency the head, without a rival and free from stain. It is true that the independence of the \"great R\u00e1\u00e1s of Chittour\" was assailed by the Moguls, and that they succumbed to circumstances; but they never acknowledged a superior in birth or descent. The family dates back upwards of a thousand years. It was in 1614 A.D., in the reign of the emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, that the house was first compelled by force of arms to surrender that complete independence it had then maintained for eight hundred years, and to acknowledge fealty to the throne of D\u00e1hli. In 1612 we first hear of the renowned R\u00e1\u00e1s Sang\u00e1 of Chittour. His army consisted of 80,000 horse, supported by 500 war elephants. Seven R\u00e1\u00e1s of the highest rank, and a hundred and thirteen of inferior note attended his stirrup in the field. The R\u00e1\u00e1s of Jaipur and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r served under his banner, and he was the acknowledged head of all the R\u00e1jp\u00fat tribes. In 1627 A.D. he espoused the cause of the dethroned dynasty of Dehl\u00ed. All the princes of R\u00e1jp\u00fatana ranged themselves under his banner, and he advanced with 100,000 men to drive Babar across the Indus. The first conflict took place at Biana where the advanced guard of the Moguls was totally routed by the R\u00e1jp\u00fats. In 1658 A.D. Udai Singh, the son of R\u00e1\u00e1s Sang\u00e1, came under the displeasure of Akbar. He fled and left the defence of his capital Chittour to R\u00e1ja Jaimal who was killed by Akbar himself. His death deprived the garrison of all confidence, and they determined to sell their lives as dear as possible. The women threw themselves on the funeral pile of the R\u00e1ja, and the men rushed frantically on the weapons of the Moguls and perished to the number of 8000. In 1614 Part\u00e1p Singh reigned and recovered the greater portion of his dominion before Akbar died. In 1678 A.D., Aurangz\u00e9b marched against Udaipur and succeeded in subjugating it, but the alienation of the R\u00e1jp\u00fats from the Moguls was not complete, and never changed. The great boast of the chiefs of Udaipur is, that their house never gave a daughter to the Mogul sultanate. Jaipur and Jodhpur did, and gloried in these imperial alliances as conferring additional dignity on their families.\n\nList of the R\u00e1\u00e1s of Udaipur.\n\n| R\u00e1\u00e1s S\u00e1nk\u00e1 | died 1628 |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| Udai Singh, son of R\u00e1\u00e1s S\u00e1nk\u00e1 | |\n| Part\u00e1p Singh, son of Udai Singh | 1694 |\n| Amar Singh, son of Part\u00e1p Singh | 1619 |\n| Karan, son of Amar Singh, embellished Udaipur | |\n| Jagat Singh, son of R\u00e1\u00e1s Karan, tributary to Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n | 1662 |\n| R\u00e1j Singh, son of Jagat Singh | 1680 |\n| Jai Singh, son of R\u00e1j Singh. | |\n| Amar Singh II. | |\n| Sangram Singh. | |\n| Jagat II pays chouth to the Marhattas. | |\n\nRanbir Singh, Maharaja, the present independent ruler of Kashmir, is the son of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Gul\u00e1b Singh whom he succeeded about the month of July or August, 1867 A.D.\n\nRanchhor Das, a learned K\u00e1ysth of Jaunp\u00far, and author of a work on the art of writing prose and poetry, entitled \"D\u00e1k\u00ed\u00e9k-ul-Insh\u00e1,\" which he wrote in the year 1732 A.D., 1146 A.H.\n\nRandhir Singh, the J\u00e1t R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhartp\u00far, was the eldest son of Ranjit Singh whom he succeeded.

From this inferior station he gradually rose, and afterwards accompanied the Pe\u00e1hw\u00e1 in the expedition which was undertaken at the close of the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sah\u00e1j\u00ed against the province of M\u00e1lw\u00e1.

He was a contemporary of Anwari, and was in the fort of Haz\u00e1r Asp, while besieged by Sultan Sanjar, in whose service Anwari was. During the siege the two poets wrote very severe satires against the parties of each other, which they exchanged by means of arrows; but the fort being at length taken, Watwat was made prisoner. He was, however, released at the intercession of Anwari, and they both became intimate friends. He was called Watwat, which is the name of a small animal, on account of his being of a small stature and thin in body. He died in the year 1182 A.D., 578 A.H., in the time of Sultan Shah the son of Arsal\u00e1n, the son of Atais, aged 97 years, at Jurj\u00e1nia in Khw\u00e1rizm.

He is the author of the \"J\u00e1ma'-ut-Tav\u00e1r\u00edkh,\" or Collection of Histories, which he completed in 1310 A.D., 710 A.H., and deposited in the mosque constructed by him at Tabriz. He was born in the city of Hamd\u00e1n in 1247 A.D., 646 A.D., was by profession a physician, and it was probably owing to skill in the science of medicine that he procured office under the Tartar Sultan of Persia. He passed part of his life in the service of Ab\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, king of Persia. At a subsequent period Gh\u00e1s\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, who was a friend to literature, appointed him to the post of Was\u00edr in 1298 A.D., 697 A.H. in conjunction with Sa'd-uddin who became his enemy. Rashid-uddin was maintained in his office by Alj\u00e1it\u00fa, surnamed Kh\u00fad\u00e1 Band\u00e1, the brother and successor of Gh\u00e1s\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, and was treated by him with great consideration and rewarded with the utmost liberality. Rashid-uddin in his first rupture with Sa'd-uddin, was compelled in self-defence to denounce him, and to cause him to be put to death. Amir 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h J\u00fab\u00e1n a person of low origin, was appointed Sa'd-uddin's successor at Rashid-uddin's request, but they soon fell out, and shortly after the death of Alj\u00e1it\u00fa who was succeeded by his son Sultan Ab\u00fa Sa'id, Amir 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h so far succeeded in prejudicing the Sultan against the old minister, that he was removed from the wizarat in 1317 A.D., 717 A.H. A short time afterwards he was recalled, but it was not long before he again lost favour at court, and was accused of causing the death of his patron Alj\u00e1it\u00fa Kh\u00e1n. It was charged against him that he had recommended a purga-\ntive medicine to be administered to the late king, in opposition to the advice of another physician, and that under its effects the king had expired. He was condemned to death, and his son Ibrahim, the chief butler, who was only 16 years old, and by whose hands the potion was said to have been given to the king, was put to death before the eyes of his parent, who was immediately afterwards cloven in twain by the executioner. His head was borne through the streets of Tabriz, and proclaimed by the public erier as the head of a Jew. Rashid-uddin was 73 years old when he died, and his death occurred on the 19th July, 1318 A.D., 17th Jamad\u0101 I, 718 A.H. His eldest son Gay\u0101s-uddin was subsequently raised to the same dignities as his father, and met with an equally tragic death. Amir 'Ali Shah continued by his address to maintain his high honours and the favour of his master for the space of six years when he died; being the only Wazir, since the establishment of the Mongol monarchy, who had not met with a violent death. Besides the \"Jami'-ud-Daw\u0101'ir,\" Rashid-uddin composed several other works, such as the \"Kit\u0101b-i-Tanq\u012bh,\" \"Mift\u0101h-ut-Taf\u0101s\u012br,\" and the \"Ris\u0101lat-us-Sult\u0101n\u012bat,\" vide Fazl-ullah. The body of Rashid-uddin was buried near the mosque which he had constructed in Tabriz; but by a strange fatality, it was not destined to repose quietly in this, its last asylum. Nearly a century after his death, the government of Tabriz together with Azurb\u0101jan, was given by Taim\u016br to his son Mirz\u0101 Sh\u0101h. This young prince, naturally of mild disposition, had become partially deranged in consequence of an injury of the head occasioned by a fall from his horse, and one day, during a temporary access of madness, caused the bones of Rashid-uddin to be exhumed, and they were finally deposited in the cemetery of the Jews.\n\nRashid Billah, \u0631\u0627\u0634\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, a Khalifa of Baghd\u0101d, vide Al-Rashid Billah.\n\nRashk, \u0631\u0634\u06a9, poetical name of 'Al\u012b Aq\u1e63at, who is the author of a dictionary and three Urdu Diw\u0101ns, the last of which he composed in 1845 A.D., 1261 A.H.\n\nRasikh, \u0631\u0627\u0633\u062e, the poetical appellation of M\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad Z\u0101m\u0101n of Sarhind.

He succeeded his brother Jaw\u0101hir Singh in the r\u0101j of Bharotgarh in 1768 A.D., 1182 A.H., and was not long after murdered by a low assassin named R\u016bpa Nanda, who pretended to be a transmitter of melekh, and whom the Raj\u0101s had threatened with death. Ratan Singh reigned ten months and thirteen days, and left an infant son named Kehri Singh, during whose minority internal commotions, occasioned by contests for the r\u0101jency, principally contributed to the success of Najaf Kh\u0101n with whom the J\u0101ts were then at war.

During his youth he served as a soldier both against the Hindus and Christians; by the latter he was taken prisoner, and obliged to work at the fortifications of Tripoli, whence he was liberated by a person who gave him his daughter in marriage; but the lady was of so bad a temper that the poet complained she had exchanged her slavery for a worse bondage. He was a great traveller, and made the pilgrimage of Mecca fourteen times. He was a disciple of the venerated Sufi, Abdul Kadir Gilani, or at least, adopted his opinion. His tomb is still to be seen in the neighbourhood of Shiraz. Besides the Gulistan and Bostan, he is the author of a large collection of Odes and Sonnets. There is likewise a short collection of poetical pieces attributed to him called \"Al-Khabisat\" or the book of Impurities. The author, however, seems to have repented of having written these indecent verses, yet endeavours to excuse himself on account of their giving a relish to other poems, \"as salt is used in the seasoning of meat.\" His works, all of which are held in great estimation, are the following:\u2014\n\nA Preface.

He was succeeded by his son Malik-ul-'Aziz 'Usman in the government of Egypt, but as none of his successors possessed the enterprising genius of Salah-uddin, the history of Egypt from that time to the year 1250 A.D. affords nothing remarkable. At this time the reigning Sultan Malik-al-Salah was deposed and slain by the Mamluks, a kind of mercenary soldiers who served under him.

The first king of this race was Isma'il Samani, great-grandson of Saman, a robber-chief from whom this dynasty took its name.\n\nSamani or Samnani, an Arabian author who in the 6th century of the Hijri wrote a dictionary of the names of all the Arabian authors, entitled \"Fi' Anasib,\" which in the succeeding century was abbreviated by Ibn-al-Afur, and this extract again shortened by Sayfati.

But Sambhaji supported by the greater part of the troops, who had been the companions of his contests with the forces of the emperor Alamgir, established his sovereignty. He behaved with great cruelty to his opponents, imprisoned Rajah Ram and reigned nine years. He succeeded his father in April, 1680 A.D., generally spent his time in female pleasure and excessive drinking, and possessed no talents for government. He listened to the advice of no one, having a concealed opinion of his own abilities, and chose for his favourite Kab Kalas or Kalush, a Brahman with whom he acted such scenes as made him hateful to the world. He was taken prisoner together with his wife and children by the officers of the emperor Alamgir, who ordered him to be executed. His eyes were first destroyed with a hot iron, his tongue cut out, and he was at last beheaded along with his favourite. This event took place in July or August, 1689 A.D., 1100 A.H. His son Sahji also called Sao or Sahi, an infant, was acknowledged raja by the Marathas, but he was soon after taken prisoner by Alamgir and confined till the death of that monarch when he was released.

He succeeded to the gulf of Mowar by adoption in 1862. His elevation was great and sudden, as his father, a brother of the late Rana Sarup Singh had fallen under suspicion of conspiring to gain his way to the throne by poisoning the invalid Sarup; and, while the father died under the hands of assassins in a prison within the walls of the palace, the son, along with other members of the family suffered for several years the most cruel persecution.\n\nSamani, one of the chief followers of the Sufi sect who died in 1335 A.D., 736 A.H., six years before Khwaja Kirmani.

He held at his father's death, 1092 A.D., the government of Khurasan, and took little concern in the troubles that ensued on that event; but after the death of his brother, Sultan Muhammad, he may be deemed the actual sovereign of Persia. He forced Bahram Shah, a monarch of the race of Ghazni, whose capital was Lahore, to pay him tribute; and Alaudin, prince of Ghor, who had defeated Bahram Shah and taken Ghazni, yielded in his turn to the superior fortune of Sanjar, by whom he was defeated, made prisoner and tributary to the house of Saljuqi. But Sanjar, after a long reign marked by singular glory and success, was destined to experience the most cruel reverses of fortune. In the year 1140 A.D., 535 A.H., he advanced far into Tartary to attack Gour Khan, the monarch of Kara Khatau, and suffered a signal defeat in which almost his whole army was cut to pieces, his family taken prisoner, and all his baggage plundered. He next marched, 1153 A.D., 647 A.H., against the Turkman tribe of Ghus who had withheld their usual tribute of 40,000 sheep; an action ensued, in which he was defeated and taken prisoner. During his long confinement of four years, his dominions were ruled by his favourite Sultan Khafun Turjan; at whose death in 1156 A.D., 561 A.H., Sanjar made an effort to escape and was successful; but he lived only a short time after he regained his liberty, for he died on Friday the 24th May, 1167 A.D., 11th Rabii II, 558 A.H., in his 73rd year of his age, and was buried in Maragha. The Saljuqi dynasty in Khurasan ceased with his existence, and most part of his kingdom fell into the possession of Khwariq Shah, Ataib ibn Muhammad ibn Anushakim of Turkish Khwariq Shah.

In the reign of the emperor Muhammad Shah he was appointed governor of Gujarat 1724 A.D., 1137 A.H., but in 1730 A.D., 1143 A.H., was removed from his government on account of his\nconsenting to pay the Marhattas the Chouth or part of the revenue of that province, and R\u00e1j\u00e1 Abhay Singh the son of Ajit Singh Rathor was appointed to succeed him. Sarbaland Kh\u00e1n made some opposition to his successor, but was defeated and prevented from coming to court by the emperor.

He was the uncle of Shaikh Junaid as well as his master. The following anecdote is related on good authority: Sari Sakti said that for thirty years he never ceased imploring divine pardon for having once exclaimed, \"Praise be to God!\" and on being asked the reason, he said: \"A fire broke out in Baghdad, and a person came up to me and told me that my shop had escaped, on which I uttered those words, and even to this moment I repent having said so, because it showed that I wished better to myself than to others.\" He died on Wednesday the 9th of August, 370 A.D., 6th Ramaz\u00e1n, 266 A.H., and is buried at Baghd\u00e1d.

The cause of this murder is thus recorded: \"'Al\u00ed-uddaula having accidentally met the niece of his wazir Mah\u00e1bat Jang, a young lady who bore the repute of being the most beautiful woman of the age, first commanded, and then entreated, her to withdraw her veil, that he might enjoy one look at her face. The modest damsel, overwhelmed with confusion and terror, entreated the prince's pardon, and, pleading eloquently for her honour, declined to gratify his curiosity; but he, being charmed with her exquisite grace and the delicious tones of her voice, was fired with a hasty determination, and himself withdrew the veil. He gazed in ardent admiration on her lovely countenance for a few seconds, then dropping the drapery, he asked forgiveness for his indiscretion, and paying the beauty some scarcely compliment, passed on. The unhappy girl fled, in tears, to her father, 'At\u00e9lf\u00e1ll\u00e1h, and to uncle the wazir, and with mixed indignation and shame, declared the sad tale of her disgrace, and immediately afterwards destroyed herself with poison.

By the treaty of 26th October, 1799 A.D., the English Government decided between two rival claimants, to place Sarfoji upon the masnad, on condition that he transferred the management of his territory to the British, consenting to receive in lieu of its revenue, an annual payment of \u00a3118,360. The absolute sovereignty of the fortress and city of Tanjore itself, were at the same time guaranteed to the prince. Sarfoji died in 1832 A.D., and was succeeded by his only son Siraj\u00ed, who reigned 24 years and died on the 29th October, 1856 A.D., leaving no legitimate son to succeed him.

He was a good poet, had the good fortune to become acquainted with almost all men of talents of his day. He died at the advanced age of 76 years about the year 1714 A.D., 1126 A.H., and left besides the above-mentioned work, four Masnav\u00eds or poems, viz., \"Hum-o-Ishk,\" \"Nur-i-'Ali,\" \"S\u00e1ki-n\u00e1m\u00e1,\" and \"Sh\u00e1h-n\u00e1m\u00e1 Muhammad 'Az\u00edm.\"\n\nSarmad or Muhammad Sarmad, \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u062f, Kazi of Sr\u00edngapatan in the time of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, by whose request he translated into Persian a work in the Dakh\u00e1n\u00ed dialect, and called it \"Khul\u00e1s\u00e1 Sult\u00e1n\u00ed.\"\n\nSarmad, \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u062f, the poetical name of an Armenian merchant who came to India in the reign of the emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.

He was well-versed in the Persian language and was a good poet. In the beginning of the reign of 'Alamg\u00edr, he was sentenced to death on account of his disobeying the orders of that emperor who had commanded him not to go about naked. This event took place about the year 1661 A.D., 1072 A.H. Some say that the real cause of his execution was a Rub\u00e1i which he had composed, the translation of which is \"The Mullas say that Muhammad entered the heavens; but Sarmad says that the heavens entered Muhammad.\" His tomb is close to the Jama Masjid at Dehl\u00ed.\n\nSarmadi, \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u062f\u06cc, Takhallus of Muhammad Sharif of Isfah\u00e1n.

He began life in an indifferent school for the character of reformer and saint, which he ultimately assumed, as a saw\u00e1r serving with Amir Kh\u00e1n's free-booting horse in M\u00e1l\u00e1. Quitting that service, he repaired to Dehl\u00ed, and became a disciple of Sh\u00e1h 'Abdul 'Az\u00edz, a very celebrated devotee of the city; the fame of whose knowledge and piety had been widely extended throughout this side of India. It is frequently said by natives, that it was Sh\u00e1h 'Abdul 'Az\u00edz, that Sayyad Ahmad derived the peculiar opinions which he subsequently promulgated, and the design which he adopted of preaching up a religious war. It is at least certain, that the chief of his first disciples, and the most constant associates of all his fortunes, were two near relatives of 'Abdul 'Az\u00edz, one his nephew, Maulwi Muhammad Ism\u00e1'il, author of the Sir\u00e1t-ul-Mustak\u00edm, the other his son-in-law, and also partially a contributor to the book, named Maulwi 'Abdul H\u00e1\u00ed. By these persons, Muhammad Ism\u00e1'il is generally esteemed to have been a man of much talent and learning. The extreme honour which he and his brother Maulwi paid to Sayyad Ahmad, who was himself nearly illiterate, had a powerful effect in attracting towards him the respect of the vulgar. They rendered him almost monial offices, running, it is said, with their shoes off, by the side of his palankeen, when, he moved out with his servants. From his first leaving Dehl\u00ed, he assumed the name of a religious teacher, and commenced spreading his religious doctrines. The general spirit by which these were animated (identical nearly with that of the tenets of the Arabian Wah\u00e1b\u00ed, of whom the sect of Sayyad Ahmad may perhaps be accurately termed an Indian imitation) was the ardent profession of Muhammadanism in its primitive simplicity and fervour, and the utter rejection of all idolatrous or superstitious innovations, whencesoever derived. The manner in which they were at first actually received was, however, highly favourable. When Sayyad Ahmad at last came down to Bengal, he had got together many followers, and had established an extensive reputation. He arrived in Calcutta with a considerable retinue towards the end of 1821 A.D., and immediately a great majority of the Muhammadans of the place, of all ranks and stations, flocked to become, or to profess themselves, his disciples. In the early part of 1822, he proceeded with his friends, the two Moulwis, to Mecca, from whence he returned in October of the next year, having touched for a few days at Bombay, where, with reference to the shortness of his stay, his success, in gaining numerous followers, was nearly as remarkable as in Calcutta. In December, 1823 A.D., he again started for Upper India. The next important event of his career, his commencing a religious war in the L\u00e1hor territories, did not occur till after a considerable interval, though the enterprise was one in which he had long openly announced his intention to engage. Its date is given in the \"Targh\u00edb-ul-Jih\u00e1d,\" or \"Incitement of Religious War,\" a little treatise written in Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed during the continuance of the struggle, by a Maulwi of Kanauj, with the view, as its name purports, of rousing the Faithful to rally round the standard which had been raised in the Panj\u00e1b. \"The tribe of Sh\u00e1h\u00eds,\" says the indignant Maulwi, \"have long held sway in L\u00e1hir\u00ed and other places. Their oppressions have exceeded all limits. Thousands of Muhammadans they have unjustly killed, and thousands have they heaped disgrace. The 'Az\u00e1n, or summons for prayer, and the killing of cows, they have entirely prohibited. When at length their insulting tyranny could no longer be borne, Sayyad Ahmad, going to the direction of Kh\u00e1l\u00ed and Kandah\u00e1r, roused the Muhammadans of those countries, and nerving their courage for action in the service of God, some thousands of believers became ready at his call to tread the path of God's service; and on the 21st December, 1826 A.D., 20th Jam\u00e1d\u00e1 I., 1242 A.H., the Jih\u00e1d against the K\u00e1f\u00edr Sikhs began.\" The events of this war were watched with a natural interest by the Muhammadan population of India generally, whether followers of Sayyad Ahmad or not. Many of the inhabitants of our Western Provinces went in bodies to range themselves under his standard; and his emissaries gathered large contributions of money and jewels, even from our own distant Presidencies, and from the principal Muhammadan towns of the Dakh\u00edn. The prominent occurrences of the war, the perseverance with which it was kept up, the temporary and occasional successes which Sayyad Ahmad met with, and his ultimate death in battle, are well known. With his death, the struggle appears to have entirely ceased.\u2014Journal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. I, p. 480.\n\nSayyad 'Ali or Sayyad 'Ali Hamdani, \u0639\u0644\u06cc \u0647\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc, a famous Sayyad who fled to Kashmir from his native city of Hamd\u00e1n where he had incurred the wrath of Amir Taimur.

His son Mir Muhammad Hamd\u00e1n\u00ed, also a fugitive, brought in his train three hundred Sayyads to Kashmir.\nwhere he remained twelve years.

Though he was very religious, and brought up in the Muhammadian faith, yet he followed some particular tenets of his own, so that he never attended public worship. He kept no women nor slaves for himself, and lived upon rice only; yet his expenses in charity were so great, that as he never accepted any presents, men were astonished whence his finances were supplied, and actually believed, that he possessed the art of transmuting other metals into gold. He made nothing of bestowing two or three thousand pieces of gold to relieve the wants of any noble family in distress. In short, he displayed more magnificence in his feasts than the princes themselves. He expended daily upon the poor 1000 maunds of flour, 500 maunds of meat, 80 maunds of sugar, besides rice, oil, butter and other necessaries in proportion. He latterly began to bestow titles and offices upon his disciples, and to assume a tone and manner sufficiently indicative of his design on the throne. One of his followers dissatisfied with the part assigned to him, went privately to the king (Jal\u00e1l-udd\u00edn F\u00edroz Khilji) and disclosed the plot. The king caused him to be apprehended and trodden to death by an elephant.

Bhim Sen, rana of Udaipur, the first in rank among the Hindu princes, had a son named Bhag Singh by a concubine of a tribe very inferior to his own. On the death of his father, Bhag Singh finding himself despised and neglected by his relations, the Sisodia Rajputs, who from the low caste of his mother, regarded him only as a bastard, and not of their tribe, became weary of the indignities shown him; and moved from Udaipur to Khandaesh where he embraced the service of a Zamindar, named Raj Ali Mohan. He afterwards retired into the Dakhin, where he purchased a tract of land near the present Maratha capital of Pune, and settled upon it as Zamindar, in which situation he died. Bhag Singh had four sons, two of whom, Mallaji and Bamji, being of an enterprising spirit, entered into the service of Jadhoo Rao, a Maratha chief of distinguished rank at the court of Bahadur Nizam Shah. Mallaji had a son named Sahji or Sajji who married the daughter of Jadhoo Rao, and thus the Bhola family became incorporated with the Marathas, and are commonly esteemed as such in Hindustan. Sahji, after the death of his father, left Ahmadnagar with his followers and entered into the service of Ibrahim Adil Shah, king of Bijapur, who gave him a jagir in the Karnatic, with a command of ten thousand horse. Soon after this in May, 1627 A.D. his son Sewaji, afterwards so celebrated in the Dakhin, was born, from the daughter of Jadhoo Rao Maratha. Sewaji having disagreed with his wife, sent her, with the infant Sewaji, to reside at Pune, of which, and the vicinity, he had obtained a grant. Sewaji though neglected by his father was properly educated, and at the age of seventeen excelled in every accomplishment. Military fame was his first passion; and the government of Bijapur being now weakened by intestine divisions and the encroachments of the Mughals, he had soon an opportunity of signalizing himself among other rebels. He raised a banditti, and plundered the neighbouring districts, and having now taken possession of the jagir, raised more troops, successfully levied contributions on several Zamindars, and much extended the limits of his territories. At this crisis the prince Aurangzeb, governor of the imperial territories of the Dakhin, was meditating the overthrow of his brother Dara Shikoh, the favourite son of the emperor Shah Jahangir, who was now in a dangerous state of health. For this purpose he was preparing an army to march to Agra; and, observing the enterprising genius of Sewaji, sent him an invitation to his service. Sewaji pretending to be struck with horror at the rebellion of a son against a father, received the prince's messenger with indignity, drove him from his presence, and ordered the letter he had brought to be tied to the tail of a dog. Aurangzeb for the present stifled his resentment, but never would forgive Sewaji's insolence, and hence may be dated his tedious war in the Dakhin, and finally the ruin of the Mughal empire by the Marathas. Aurangzeb having left the Dakhin in 1658 A.D., 1068 A.H., Sewaji resolved to turn the inactivity of the imperial troops, and the weakness of the Golkanda and Bijapur princes, to the utmost advantage. He took the strong fortress of Rajgarh, which he fixed upon as the seat of his government. The Bijapur government having in vain desired his father Sahji, (who disclaimed all connection with him) to repress the excesses of his son, at length sent against him a considerable force under a general named Azul Khan. Sewaji with artful policy invited him to come and receive his submission. Azul Khan advanced without opposition to his tent, when he was stabbed by the treacherous Zamindar in embracing him. Upon a signal given, the Marathas rushed from an ambuscade, attacked the unsuspecting army of Bijapur, which, deprived of their chief, was quickly defeated. Sewaji plundered their rich camp, and by this victory became master of all Kookan, the Zamindars of which flocked to acknowledge his authority, to save their possessions. The strong fortress of Sitara and other places also opened their gates to receive him. In the course of only three years, Sewaji became a powerful prince, his authority being acknowledged over almost the whole coast of Mawar. He built palaces and erected fortifications in every part of his country; gave much trouble to the emperor 'Alamgir; reigned more than twenty years, and left a character which has never since been equalled or approached by any of his countrymen. He died on the 14th April, 1680 A.D., 24th Rabii I., 1091 A.H., but according to Elphinstone's History of India, on the 5th April the same year, aged 53 years. His funeral pile was administered with the same sacrifices as had been devoted the year before to the obsequies of the Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur; attendants, animals, and wives, were burnt with his corpse. He was succeeded by his son Sambha or Sambhaji.\n\nSecoji or Shoji, \u0634\u062c\u06cc, a grandson of the renowned Jaichand, the last R\u00e1thor monarch of Kanauj. He with a few retainers migrated in the year 1212 A.D., and planted the R\u00e1thor standard in Mawar. His successors in process of time, by valour, and by taking advantage of the times, enlarged the state, and in 1432 A.D., Jodha Rao of Mawar, founded the modern capital of Jodhpur, to which he transferred the seat of government from Mandor. The name of Mawar is a corruption of Mardwar, also called Mard-deis, or \"the region of death.\" Anciently, and properly, it included the entire western desert, from the Satlaj to the ocean.\n\nShabib, \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06cc\u0628, the son of Yezid, the son of Na'im, was a Kh\u00e1rajite. It is related that his\nfather Yezid was sent by 'Usman the Khalif to assist the Syrian Muhammadans against the Greeks in the twenty-fifth year of the Hijra. The Musalmans obtaining the victory, the Christians were exposed for sale. Among the captives Yezid espied a beautiful maid, whom he bought, and married. She proved with child of Shabih, who was born on the 10th of the month of Zil-hijja, being the day on which the pilgrims kill the sacrifices at Mecca. He opposed Hajjaj the governor of Mecca for a long time, and was at last drowned in a river. His body being drawn out, his head was cut off and sent to Hajjaj. This happened in 696 A.D., 77 A.H.\n\nShadan, \u0634\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0646, poetical title of Rao Chandra Lal, an Amir in the service of the Nizam of Haidarabad.\n\nShaddad, \u0634\u062f\u0627\u062f, the Adite, was the son of 'Adad the first king of the 'Adites, a race of ancient Arabs; the smallest of their tribe is said to have been 60 cubits high, and the largest 100 cubits. 'Ad had two sons, Shaddad and Shaddad; on the death of their father they reigned conjointly over the whole earth. At length Shaddad died, and his brother Shaddad ruled after him. Shaddad was fond of reading the ancient books, and when he met with descriptions of Paradise and of the world to come, his heart enticed him to build its like upon the earth. A pleasant and elevated spot being fixed upon, Shaddad despatched one hundred chiefs to collect skilful artists and workmen from all countries. He also commanded the kings of Spain and Persia to send him all their jewels and precious stones. Forty camel-loads of gold, silver, and jewels were daily used in the building, which contained a thousand spacious quadrangles of many thousand rooms. In the areas were artificial trees of gold and silver, whose leaves were emeralds, and fruit clusters of pearls and jewels. The ground was strewed with ambergris, musk and saffron. Between every two of the artificial trees was planted one of delicious fruit. This romantic abode took up 500 years in the completion. To this paradise he gave the name of Ir\u00e1n. When finished, Shaddad marched to view it, and when arrived near, divided two hundred thousand youthful slaves, whom he had brought with him from Damascus, into four detachments, which were stationed in cantonments prepared for their reception on each side of the garden, towards which he proceeded with his favourite courtiers. Suddenly was heard in the air a voice like thunder, and Shaddad, looking up, beheld a personage of majestic figure and stern aspect, who said, \"I am the Angel of Death, commissioned to seize thy impure soul.\" Shaddad exclaimed, \"Give me leisure to enter the garden,\" and was descending from his horse, when the seizer of life snatched away his impure spirit, and he fell dead upon the ground. At the same time lightnings flashed, and destroyed the whole army of the infidel; and the rose-garden of Ir\u00e1n became concealed from the sight of man.\n\nIt was during the reign of Muawia, the first Khalif of Damascus, that some of the principal incidents connected with the Paradise of Shaddad, are said to have taken place. This Paradise, though invisible, is still supposed to be standing in the deserts of Aden, and sometimes, though very rarely God permits it to be seen.\n\nCrighton, in his \"History of Arabia,\" says that \"The whole fable seems a confused tradition of Belus and the ancient Babylon; or rather, as the name would import, of Benhadad, mentioned in Scripture as one of the most famous of the Syrian kings, and who, we are told, was worshipped by his subjects.\"\n\nShadid, \u0634\u0647\u06cc\u062f, an eminent Musalman doctor and author who died in the year 1447 A.D., 851 A.H.\n\nShafai, \u0634\u0627\u0641\u06cc, an author, whose proper name is Muhammad bin Faramurz.\n\nShadam, Sultan, \u0634\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646, a poet who had assumed the title of Sultan on account of his being a descendant of the royal race of Ghiyars, whose territory was between the countries of the Panjshir and Hasan Abdal.

It is from that origin that the Sunnis give to this doctor the title of Imam-ul-Mutallibi, as well as that of 'Arif Billah, or learned in God. He was born at Ghaza a city of Palestine on the very day that Abu Hanifa died 767 A.D., 156 A.H., and eventually became the founder of the third of the chief Sunni sects. He died in Egypt on Friday the 60th January, 820 A.D., 30th Rajab, 204 A.H., aged 64 lunar years. He is the author of several works, and is said by all Sunni writers to have been a learned and virtuous man, who laboured to arrange the traditions so as to render them useful as a code of laws. In his youth he was a pupil of Malik ibn Anas. His followers were at one time very numerous in Khurasan; but at present his opinions are rarely quoted, either in Persia or India. He is reputed to have composed two collections of traditions, namely, the \"Masnad\" and the \"Sunan.\" Besides the works on the traditions, he is said to have composed a most excellent treatise on jurisprudence, called \"Al-Fikh-ul-Akbar;\" but it has been questioned whether he was the author.\n\nShafai, \u0634\u0627\u0641\u06cc, poetical appellation of a poet.

He then, according to the historian Haidar Malik, invaded Hindustan with an immense army, and is said to have worsted Firoz Shah king of Delhi in a pitched battle on the banks of the Sathri; the result of which was to cause that potentate to acknowledge his supremacy. Shahabuddin then returned to Kashmir, where his religious zeal led him to destroy the idol temples at Bijbehara and elsewhere. He died after a reign of 19 years, 1376 A.D., and was succeeded by his brother Kutb-uddin, during whose reign, the famous Sayyad 'Ali Hamdani arrived at Kashmir.\n\nShahadat, \u0634\u0647\u0627\u062f\u062a, poetical name of Mirza Salah of Balkh, who died in 1742 A.D., 1156 A.H.\n\nShah 'Alam, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645, king of Delhi, whose original name was 'Ali Gohar, was the son of the emperor Alamgir II, by Zinat Mahal surnamed Bilal Kunwar; was born on the 15th of June, 1738 A.D., 1172 Z.K., 1140 A.H. In the year 1758 A.D., 1172 A.H., fearing he might be made a prisoner by Imad-ul-Mulk Ghaziuddin Khan, the minister of his father, he left Delhi to try his fortune in Bengal, the Nawab of which province, Siraj-ud-daula had been deposed by the assistance of the English, and Mir Jafar set up in his room. He was in Behar, when he received the intelligence of the murder of his father, and having assumed the imperial authority, he ascended the throne on the 26th of December, 1759 A.D., 4th Jamadi I, 1173 A.H. with the title of Shah 'Alam. After the defeat of Shuja-ud-daula his prime-minister, at Buxar on the 23rd October, 1764 A.D., 26th Rabi' II, 1178 A.H., and his flight to the upper province, the king followed the English to Allahabad where he granted the East India Company the Sanad of the Diwan of Bengal dated 12th August, 1765 A.D., 24th Safar, 1179 A.H. on the Company agreeing to pay the emperor 24 lacs of rupees annually from the revenues of the three provinces, viz., Bengal, Behar, and Uryas. This important business being settled by Lord Clive, he returned to Calcutta, leaving General Smith to attend the emperor, but in fact to rule him; for the General resided in the fortress, and his majesty in the town; and the sound of the imperial naubat in the fort being disagreeable to General Smith, he forbade the band to play, nor did the servants of the emperor refuse. Shah 'Alam continued to reside at Allahabad under the protection of the English till the year 1778 A.D., 1185 A.H. when growing weary of his retirement, he proceeded to Delhi where he arrived on the 25th of December the same year, but not long after fell into the power of Ghulam Kadir Khan a Rohella chief, who put out his eyes on the 10th of August, 1783 A.D., Ramazan, 1188 A.H. Shah 'Alam after this event re-assumed the throne and died on the 19th November, 1806 A.D., 7th Ramazan, 1221 A.H., aged 81 lunar years. Shah 'Alam's poetical name was 'Afzal.

He passed the first part of his life as a Dervish or merchant, but was afterwards employed by the emperor Akbar, and raised to the dignity of an Amir. He was appointed governor of Bengal in 1584 A.D., 992 A.H., and died in the fifth year of the reign of that monarch, 1589 A.D., 1000 A.H., aged 70 years. He was buried at Ajmer near the mausoleum of Khwaja Mo'in-uddin Chishti.

Mirza Zunnun met his death in attempting to resist an invasion under Muhammad Khan Shahban Ushak. After his death the government of Kandahar devolved on his son Shah Beg Arghun. When the emperor Babar Shah invaded the province of Kandahar, Shah Beg unable to resist him retreated towards Sindh, and having overcome Jam Firuz the last king of the Samana dynasty, 1521 A.D., 927 A.H., he settled himself as king in that country. His reign was, however, but of short duration, for he died two years and some months after the conquest, in the year 1524 A.D., 930 A.H., and his eldest son Shah Husain Arghun succeeded him.\n\nShah Begam, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0645, this was the title conferred by Jahangir on his first wife who was the daughter of Bhagwan Das the son of Rajah Behari Mal. She was married to prince Salim (afterwards Jahangir) in 1584 A.D., 993 A.H., and became the mother of Sultan Husro who was born in 1587 A.D., 996 A.H. When Jahangir rebelled against his father Akbar, and was living independently at Allahabad he gave himself up more than ever to debauchery. He had always entertained a peculiar dislike for his eldest son Sultan Husro whose own levity and violence seem to have given him reasons for his displeasure. Some circumstance in their disputes so affected Husro's mother, that she swallowed poison (opium) in 1603 A.D., 1012 A.H., and died at Allahabad where she was buried in a place called Sultan Husro's garden, where her son Sultan Husro was afterwards buried.\n\nShah Begam, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0645, a daughter of Muhammad Mukim, brother of Shah Beg Arghun, governor of Kandahar and afterwards king of Sindh.

He was, however, defeated and slain in a battle against Shah 'Isma'il Safv\u00ed, in 1510 A.D., 916 A.H., when his skull was overlaid with gold, and made into a drinking cup by that monarch. After his death Taim\u00far Sult\u00e1n succeeded him and J\u00e1n\u00ed Beg Sult\u00e1n and 'Abdull\u00e1h Kh\u00e1n divided Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1 between themselves. The Uzbaks were Tartars who came from the borders of Russia, where they had been governed by a race of princes descended from Shaib\u00e1n\u00ed, the grandson of Chagres Kh\u00e1n; but they derived their name from Usbak, the seventh of their race, who introduced the Muhammadan religion among them. The last prince of this tribe was Burgr\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, who was slain by Shah Bakht, upon which the Uzbaks quitted their ancient habitation, and conquered Khuras\u00e1n, Kharizm, &c.\n\nShahi, Mir or Amir, poetical name of 'Ak\u00e1 Malik son of Jam\u00e1l-udd\u00edn Firozkohi.

After his death the government of Sindh was divided between two rivals, Mahm\u00fad the governor of Bakkar and Mirz\u00e1 I\u1e63\u0101 Turkh\u00e1n governor of Thatta, who both assumed the title of king, and between whom frequent dissensions arose, and battles were fought. The emperor Akbar on coming to Lahor reduced the whole of the province of Bakkar exclusive of the fort, till at last Mahm\u00fad was willing to give it up, and Akbar deputed Ge\u00eds\u00ed Kh\u00e1n to receive it, but Mahm\u00fad died before his arrival, 1574 A.D., 982 A.H., after a reign of 20 lunar years, and Akbar thus became possessed of Upper Sindh, and put an end to the hopes of the race of Mahm\u00fad. I\u1e63\u0101 Turkh\u00e1n who took possession of Thatta after the death of Shah Husain, died after a reign of 13 years in 1567 A.D., 976 A.H.\n\nShah Husain Safwi, succeeded his father Shah Sulaim\u00e1n, king of Persia in 1694 A.D., 1184 A.H. In the year 1722, Mahm\u00fad, an Afghan chief of Kandah\u00e1r besieged Isfah\u00e1n, and compelled Sultan Husain to surrender and resign his crown to him. This circumstance occurred on the 23rd of October the same year 1185 A.H., and the unfortunate Sult\u00e1n was confined in a small palace, where he remained seven years; when a reverse of fortune which threatened their downfall led his enemies, whose chief was Ashraf the successor of Mahm\u00fad, to put an end to his existence. This melancholy event took place in November, 1729 A.D., 1142 A.H. The Saf\u00edwan family may be said to have actually terminated with Sultan Husain. His son Tahmasp, assumed the title of king, and struggled for a few years with his fate, but a weak effeminate, and debauched youth, was unsuited for such times: and he only merits a place in history, as his name furnished a pretext for the celebrated N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h to lay the foundation of his great power.\n\nShah Husain Sayyad, Vide H\u00e1tk\u00e1t.\n\nShahidi, poetical name of Mir 'Abdul W\u00e1hid of Bilgr\u00e1m, which see.\n\nShaista Khan, Nawab, the son of Asaf Kh\u00e1n the prime minister.\n\nShahidi Kummi, an author who was a native of Kumm, and died in 1529 A.D., 935 A.H.\n\nShah Jalal, a Muhammadan saint of great sanctity, whose tomb is in Sylhet.

He was born at Lahor on the 5th January, 1592 A.D., 29th R\u00e1b\u00ed' I, 1000 A.H., and named Mirz\u00e1 Khurrum. His mother Balmat\u00ed was the daughter of Raj\u00e1 Udai Singh, son of Raj\u00e1 Maldeo of Jodhpur, and sister to Raj\u00e1 S\u00faraj Singh. At the time of his father's death he was absent in the Dakhin, but the throne was secured for him by his father-in-law, 'Asaf Kh\u00e1n the was\u00edr, the brother of N\u00far Jah\u00e1n Begam. He marched towards Lahor on hearing of the throne being at his disposal; and began his reign 4th February, 1628 A.D., 6th Jum\u00e1da II, 1037 A.H. He was the most magnificent prince that ever appeared in India. The most striking instance of his pomp and prodigality was his construction of the famous Peacock throne. It took its name from two peacocks fashioned splendidly in sapphires, emeralds, rubies and other appropriate jewels which formed the chief ornament of a mass of bullion and precious stones that dazzled every beholder. Tavernier, a jeweller by profession, reports, that it cost nearly six millions and a half sterling. His greatest splendour was shown in his buildings. He founded a new city at Dehl\u00ed called after him Shahjah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00edd, but of all the structures erected by him, there is none that bears any comparison\nwith the T\u00e1j Mahal at Agra, a mausoleum of white marble decorated with mosaic, which for the richness of the material, the chasteness of the design, and the effect at once brilliant and solemn, is not surpassed by any edifice, either in Europe or Asia. T\u00e1j Mahal is a corruption of Mumt\u00e1z Mah\u00e1l, the name of Shah Jah\u00e1n's favourite wife, whose sepulchre it forms. Shah Jah\u00e1n reigned thirty years and was deposed and confined in the fort of Agra by his son Alamgir Aurangzeb on th 9th of June, 1658 A.D., 17th R\u00e1ma\u1e0d\u00e1n, 1068 A.H., and died at Agra after an imprisonment of 7 years and 10 months, on Monday night the 23rd January, 1666 A.D., 26th Rajab, 1076 A.H., aged 76 lunar years 3 months and 17 days. He died in the T\u00e1j close to his wife's tomb. There were living at the time of his imprisonment four of his sons and four daughters. Of the sons, the eldest was D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh, the second Sult\u00e1n Shuj\u00e1, the third 'Xlamg\u00edr, the fourth Mur\u00e1d Baksh; but 'Xlamg\u00edr, who succeeded his father, murdered two of his brothers, viz., D\u00e1r\u00e1 and Mur\u00e1d, and the third Sult\u00e1n Shuj\u00e1 died in Arracan, or was murdered by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of that country.

Shah Kajak died between the years 1296 and 1316 A.D.\n\nShah Jahan Begam of Bhopal, succeeded to the principality of Bhopal on the death of her mother Sikandar Begam, on the 30th of October, 1868.

He died on the 20th December, 1434 A.D., 838 A.H., aged 124 years, and is buried at Kanpur in Kanauj, where a great assembly is held every year at his tomb.

He was born at Sh\u00edst\u00e1n 1550 A.D., 957 A.H., came to L\u00e1h\u00f3r where he resided 60 years, and died there on Tuesday the 11th August, 1635 A.D., 7th Rab\u00ed I, 1045 A.H., aged 88 lunar years. He is buried at a place called Heshimp\u00far near L\u00e1h\u00f3r.

He is the author of the work called \"Ziy\u00e1-ul-Ay\u00fan,\" or the Light of the Eyes, containing the rules for propriety of conduct through life.\n\nShah Mir, first Muhammedan king of Kashmir. The original inhabitants of Kashmir appear to have been the followers of Brah\u00e1. The period of the first establishment of the Muhammedan faith in that country took place during the reign of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Seina D\u00e9va, about the year 1216 A.D., 716 A.H., when a person called Shah Mir, coming to Kashmir in the habit of a Dervish, was admitted into the service of that prince. Upon the death of the r\u00e1j\u00e1, he was appointed prime minister to his son and successor R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjan. When this r\u00e1j\u00e1 died, Anand Dev, who succeeded him, also made Shah Mir his minister. The whole of this family not only gained great ascendancy over the r\u00e1j\u00e1, but also over the minds of the people, till the r\u00e1j\u00e1, becoming jealous of their power, forbade them the court. This exclusion drove Shah Mir into rebellion, when having occupied the valley of Kashmir with his troops, most of the officers of the r\u00e1j\u00e1's government also joined him. This insurrection soon brought the r\u00e1j\u00e1 to the grave, who died of a broken heart in the year 1327 A.D., 727 A.H., leaving his widow regent. Shah Mir after some years married.\nKaula Devi, the wife of the raja, who embraced the Muhammadan faith; an event which secured to him the country which he had before nearly usurped. It is related by another author, that when preparations for the marriage were commenced, the devoted princess despairing and indignant, surrounded by her train of maidens, advanced into the presence of the usurper, and upbraiding him for his ingratitude and treachery, stabbed herself before him. Thus perished by her own hand the last Hind\u00fa sovereign of Kashmir, and Shah Mir, who is considered the first Muhammadan king of that country, ascended the throne under the title of Sultan Shamsuddin, in the year 1341 A.D., 742 A.H. He died in 1344 or 1349 A.D., 745 or 750 A.H., and was succeeded by his son Jamahid.\n\nList of the Muhammadan Kings of Kashmir:\n\n1. Sultan Shamsuddin Shah Mir,\n2.

He reigned nearly two years, and was succeeded by his son Habib who ascended the throne and reigned 3 years, after which he was imprisoned by Ghazi Chak. Ghazi Chak declared himself king and assumed the title of Ghazi Shah, and reigned 4 years, when being attacked with a leprosy, abdicated the throne in 1563 A.D.

He was appointed governor of Gujrat in the room of the prince Murad Bakhsh who was imprisoned by order of his brother 'Alamgir in July, 1658 A.D. When D\u00e1r\u00e1 Shikoh through various adventures, after his flight from Mult\u00e1n, came to Ahmadabad Gujrat, Shahnawaz Khan his maternal uncle was then in that city, and his daughter the wife of Murad Bakhsh was in his palace.

He was engaged first by Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah under whom and his son Nasir Jang he served as Diwan of Berar for several years. In the time of Salabat Jang, he was raised to the rank of 7000 with the title of Samasuddaula. On the 12th of May, 1758 A.D., 3rd Ramzan, 1171 A.H., the day on which Abdul Rahman Haidar Jang, the counsellor of Monsieur Bussy the French General, was assassinated by the instigation of Nizam Ali the brother of Salabat Jang, he also was murdered in the confusion together with his youngest son Mir Abdul Nabi Khan, but his two other sons, Mir Abdur Salam and Mir Abdul Hai escaped. The remains of the father and son were interred in the tomb of their ancestors in the southern part of the city of Aurangabad. The chronogram of this event gives the following: \"We have been murdered by Abdul Rahman\" Shahnawaz Khan is the author of the work called \"Masir-ul-Umr-e Taimuri\" containing the Memoirs of the nobility who served in Hindustan and the Dakhin under the house of Taimur. It was commenced by him, but he left it unfinished, and in the turbulent scenes which attended his death, the manuscript was scattered in various directions, and was considered as lost; some short time afterwards Mir Ghulam Ali Azad, a friend of his collected the greater portion of the missing leaves, and restored the work to its entire form with a few additions, amongst which was the life of the author: at a subsequent period again the son Mir Abdul Hai Khan who had received the title of Samasuddaula Samas Jang after his father's death, completed the work in the form in which it now occurs, in the year 1775 A.D., and died on the 28th April, 1782 A.D., 15th Jamada I, 1196 A.H.\n\nShah Nur Ashbhari, a famous poet who was a pupil of Zahir-ud-din Farabi and flourished in the reign of Sultan Muhammad Khwairizm Shah son of Taksh.

His father Rasul Kulfi's mother Fatima Sultan Begum was the daughter of Shah Sultan Hussain Safvi. Shahrukh was raised to the throne some time after the death of his grandfather, but was soon after seized and deprived of sight. He retired to Mashhad, which province he was allowed to hold in his possession till the time of his death which happened at Damghan in 1796 A.D. His death was the consequence of the tortures that had been inflicted upon him by Akbar Muhammad, king of Persia, who by this act extorted from him many precious stones of great value which had once belonged to Nadir Shah.\n\nShahrukh, Mirza, \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0648\u062e \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627, was the fourth son of Amir Taimur and held the government of Khurasan at his father's death which took place in February, 1405 A.D. After the imprisonment of Sultan Khalil his nephew, ruler of Samarqand 1408 A.D., 811 A.H., he marched from Khurasan to take possession of his dominions. His authority was immediately acknowledged, not only in Samarqand, but over all Transoxiana. He was brave and generous, but not an ambitious prince; and during a reign of 42 years, we hear of no wars in which he was engaged, except with the Turkman tribes of Asia Minor whose power Taimur had overcome, but not destroyed. Mirza Shahrukh was born at Samarqand on the 21st July, 1377 A.D., 14th Rabii I, 779 A.H., and died at Fishkhand in the province of Rei, on the Persian new year's day, viz. Sunday, the 12th March, 1447 A.D., 25th Zil-hijjah, 850 A.H., aged 71 lunar years. He reigned 42 years during which the conquests of his father in India seem to have remained in subjection to his authority. At his death he left 5 sons, viz., Mirza Ulugh Beg, Ibrahim Mirza, Mirza Baisanghar, Sayyidgahesh and Muhammad Jugi. He was succeeded by his son Mirza Ulugh Beg.\n\nShahrukh Mirza, \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0648\u062e \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627, a descendant of Amir Taimur, was the son of Ibrahim Mirza, the son of Mirza Sulaiman ruler of Badakhshan. His mother's name was Muhtarim Khana. About the year 1575 A.D., 983 A.H., he forcibly took possession of Badakhshan from his grandfather and reigned there about 10 years, after which in 1585 A.D., 993 A.H., that province was conquered by Abdullah Khan Uzbak, and Shahrukh compelled to fly to India, where he was kindly received by the emperor Akbar, who gave him his daughter Shakarun-Nisa Begum in marriage in the year 1593 A.D., 1001 A.H. and raised him to the rank of an Amir of 5,000. In the time of Jahangir the rank of 7,000 was conferred on him. He died at Ujjain 1607 A.D., 1016 A.H., and was buried there.\n\nShahrukh Mirza or Mirza Shahrukh, \u0634\u0627\u06a9\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u06c1\u0631\u0648\u062e, who had a Jagir in Gujrat, was murdered by his younger brothers in the year 1032 A.H.\n\nShahryar, \u0634\u0627\u06c1\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0631, a king of Persia of the Sassanian race, who reigned in Persia a few months in 629 A.D., vide Sheirya.\n\nShahryar, Sultan, \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u06c1\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0631, the youngest son of the emperor Jahangir, was married to a daughter of Nur Jahang Begum by her former husband Sher Afghan Khan. On the death of Jahangir in 1627 A.D., 1037 A.H., this prince who was then at Lahore, seized the royal treasure, bought over the troops, and forming a coalition\nwith the two sons of his uncle the late prince Dani\u0101l, marched out to oppose 'Asaf Kh\u0101n the war\u012bz, who had released prince D\u0101war Bakhsh surmounted Bul\u0101k\u012b the son of Sult\u0101n Kh\u0101sro from prison and proclaimed him king. The battle ended in Sh\u0101hj\u0101r's defeat, he fled but being given up by his adherents, was imprisoned and blinded. He was after three months put to death together with D\u0101war Bakhsh and the two sons of Dani\u0101l, named Tahm\u016br and Hoshang by order of Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n who ascended the throne on the 4th February, 1628 A.D., 8th Jum\u0101d\u0101 II, 1037 A.H.\n\nShah Sadr, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0635\u062f\u0631, a Muhammedan saint whose tomb is situated at the foot of a large mountain of Siwist\u0101n, at the distance of about 300 yards from the village of Lakk\u012b in Sindh which belongs to the Sayyads of that place. This famous saint, says Lutf-ullah in his Autography, originally came from Arabia, and brought thousands of infidels to the light of Isl\u0101m from the darkness of idolatry in Sindh. The year of his death is not known, but his tomb was built here by order of N\u0101dir Sh\u0101h, king of Persia, in 1155 A.H. Tradition states, that N\u0101dir in a dream was invited by this saint to come to Amarkot where he was to find a very large treasure. N\u0101dir having acted upon the visionary command, discovered the treasure promised to him, and received a very large amount, as a tribute from the Amirs of Sindh. N\u0101dir then bestowed a large sum of money upon the Sayyads of the village, directed them to have the edifice built over the remains of the saints. They carried into execution, and the following inscription at the door of the shrine gives the date of its completion:\n\n\"I inquired of intellect the year of its date,\n\"Inspiration informed me, It is the Paradise of the members of the sacred house.\" 1742 A.D., 1155 A.H.\n\nAll Sayyads of Sindh that are called Lakk\u012b Sayyads, are, I am informed (says Lutf-ullah) the descendants of this saint, whose parentage ascends up to the Im\u0101m 'Ali N\u0101ki. I am therefore inclined to think that the word Lakk\u012b is a corruption of N\u0101ki, which is the name of the tenth Im\u0101m.\n\nShah Safi, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0635\u0641\u06cc, grandson of Sh\u0101h Abb\u0101s the Great, king of Persia. His father's name was Safi M\u012brz\u0101 and his original name Bahr\u0101m M\u012brz\u0101. He succeeded his grandfather in January, 1629 A.D., Jum\u0101d\u0101 I, 1038 A.H. and took the title of Sh\u0101h Safi. He was a capricious tyrant; and every year of his rule presented the same horrid and disgusting scene of barbarous cruelty. All the princes of the blood royal, and almost every minister, or general of family or character, were either put to death, or deprived of their eyes, by command of this monarch. He reigned nearly 14 years, died in May, 1642 A.D., Safar, 1062 A.H., and was succeeded by his son, Abb\u0101s II.\n\nShah Sharaf-uddin, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0634\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646, a Muhammedan saint who died in the year 1379 A.D., 781 A.H., and is buried in Beh\u0101r, where his monument is still standing and is visited by the Muhammedans. There is an inscription in the R\u016bf\u012b character over the entrance to the dargah, which however time has rendered illegible with the exception of the date of the death of the saint, and of the erection of the tomb in 1569 A.D., 977 A.H. The dargah is held in great veneration by the Muhammedans who at the 'Urs or anniversary of the death of the saint, assemble from all parts of the country, it is said to the number of 50,000. He is also called Mahd\u016bm-ul-Mulk Shah Sharif-uddin and Shaikh Sharif.

He was sent to Kashmir by his brother Muhammad Sh\u0101h and imprisoned in the fort of the Koh-i-M\u0101r\u0101n in 1812 A.D., from which place he was released in 1814 by Ranjit Singh and detained at L\u0101hore as a prisoner till his escape to the British territories. He was placed by the British Government on the throne of K\u0101bul on the 8th May, 1839 A.D., and was murdered by his nephew, a son of Zam\u0101n Sh\u0101h on the 2nd May, 1842 A.D. He is the author of a biographical sketch of his own life written at L\u016bdhiana in 1826-27. This work was translated by Lieut. Bennet, of the Artillery, and published in the Asiatic Journal, Vol. XXX, p. 6, under Asiatic Intelligence.\n\nShah Shuj\u0101', \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0634\u062c\u0627\u0639, Sult\u0101n of the Muzaffarians whose capital was Shir\u0101z. It is said that this prince was in such a manner plagued by a malady called J\u016bl Bakar, or canine hunger, that he could not satisfy his hunger, neither on his journey, nor when he was at rest. He deprived his father Muhammad Muzaffar of his sight in 1359 A.D., and held the reins of government in his own hands. His brother Sh\u0101h Mahm\u016bd of Isfah\u0101n besieged Shir\u0101z in 1364, took possession of that country and died before his brother in 1375 A.D., 9th Shawwal, 776 A.H. after a reign of 16 years. Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101' died on Sunday the 9th of October, 1384 A.D., 21st Sh\u0101b\u0101n, 786 A.H. He was succeeded by his son Zain-ul-'\u0100bid\u012bn, who on the approach of Amir Taim\u016br to Shir\u0101z retired to Tashkar, where his uncle Sh\u0101h Mans\u016br seized him and deprived him of his sight. Shir\u0101z was bestowed by Amir Taim\u016br on Sh\u0101h Ak\u012ba the son of Muzaffar, but it was soon after taken by Sh\u0101h Mans\u016br, in whose possession it remained till it was retaken by that conqueror in 1393 A.D., 795 A.H. There is a garden near Shir\u0101z called Haft-tan, which contains the remains of Sh\u0101h Shuj\u0101', and has, on one side of it, a small building, ornamented with a variety of pictures.\n\nSh\u0101h Suf\u012b, \u0634\u0627\u06c1 \u0635\u0648\u0641\u06cc, a Muhammedan saint whose shrine is at a village called S\u016bfip\u016br in the Pargana of Firozsh\u0101d in Agr\u0101h. It is related by the Kh\u0101dimas of the dargah that in the reign of the emperor Akbar, Sh\u0101h Suf\u012b a fakir of some celebrity wandered from Isfah\u0101n to India, and took up his hermitage among the Jamna ravines near the city of Chandw\u0101r, then the county town of the Parganas of the same name, and which from the remains which still cover the surrounding country for miles\u2014ruined mosques, dilapidated octagon mausolea, fallen entrance gates and such like works of costly strength, must have been an important post in a fiscal and military point of view. All the time from which the fable of Sh\u0101h Suf\u012b's miracles commences, R\u0101j\u0101 Chandarsen was the lord of the fort of Chandw\u0101r, and a troublesome tributary of the Dahli court. Non-compliance with the royal demands for payment of revenue, brought upon the r\u0101j\u0101 the investment of his fort by the army of Akbar, who is said to have commanded his forces in person, and to have prosecuted his attack with no approach to success for a period, which the credulous or imposing Kh\u0101dimas of the establishment have exalted into a term of ten years. In the language of Oriental metaphor, the emperor is said to have planted a mango tree on the commencement of the siege, and to have eaten the fruit of it, ere his success was secured. This success he owed to the anchorite of the ravines Sh\u0101h Suf\u012b. During a severe land storm, the lamps of the entire camp were put out, and the light of the Sh\u0101h's hut alone glimmered in the surrounding darkness. This extraordinary fact led to the Sh\u0101h's being\nvisited by some of the courtiers. The miraculous character of the event being much commented on by the visitors, the Shah acknowledged himself to be under the special favour of Heaven\u2014and in the end the conversation turned upon the difficulties of the siege, and the grateful sense of the hermit's interference which the sovereign would entertain in the event of its being brought to a close by his holy means. The Shah promised the required aid, and declared that the fort should be captured by a fixed day. Thus much for the emperor. In respect to the raja, the Shah acted very effectually upon his superstitious fears\u2014told him that the fort was destined to fall, and proffered his own miraculous powers to secure for the raja, a safe and honourable retreat for himself, family and valuables. The whole were accordingly passed invisible through the besieging camp, and the raja quitted Hindust\u00e1n for the eastward. In return for this valuable service, the emperor bestowed half of an hamlet of Chandw\u00e1r on the Shah. The place assumed the name of Safipur, and has since been inhabited by the descendants of the Shah. The decease of Shah Safi took place soon after the grant was made, and he was buried on the brow of a deep ravine, a handsome tomb being erected over his remains. The mausoleum is still in good order and forms a picturesque object in the midst of the desolation of the Jamna ravines in the vicinity of Chandw\u00e1r and Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d. Its pretty dome and minarets commanding as they do, the heights of the Jamna ravines, often lead the voyagers on the river to visit the shrine of the saint, and landwards the building is an object of interest and beauty, which (says Mr. Maxwell, Collector of Agra) in a letter to the Commissioner of Revenue at Agra 29th May, 1839 (No. 125) all would regret to see lost to the country. There are several d\u00e1l\u00e1s, a handsome gate, and a small mosque comprised within the building, and the site is kept in occasional good repair by the outlay of part of the funds of the grant. The fable of the whole is palpable. Indeed the raja who, under the name of Chanderes, was ousted from Chandw\u00e1r, lived it is supposed by those best acquainted with the annals of Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d, in the reign of 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, and his descendants were the party who fell under the displeasure of Akbar.\n\nShah Sub-han, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u0632\u06cc\u0646, a Muhammedan saint who died in 1200 A.D., 596 A.H.\n\nShah Sulaiman Safwi, \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0633\u0644\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0635\u0641\u0631\u06cc, the son of Shah Abb\u00e1s II, king of Persia, whom he succeeded on the 26th August, 1666 A.D., 5th Rab\u00ed I, 1077 A.H.

He is called Shamgir by Daulat Shah.\n\nShamru, Samru or Sombre. His real name was Walter Reinhard, a person of obscure parentage in the Electorate of Treves. He entered early as a common soldier the service of the French, taking for his Nom-de-Guerre, Summer, which his comrades, from his saturnine complexion, turned into Sombre, and the Indians, by corruption, Samru and Shamru. At length he repaired to Bengal, and enlisted in one of the Swiss Companies then employed at Calcutta; but at the end of eighteen days deserted to the French at Chandarnagar, where he became a Sergeant. Deserting this post, he fled into the Upper Provinces and was for some time a private trooper in the cavalry of Safdar Jang, father to Shuja-ud-daula. This service he quitted, and led a vagabond life in different provinces; but in 1760 was with the rebel Faujdar of Purnia Khadim Husain Khan. Upon his being expelled from Bengal, Shamru left him and entered into the service of Gregory, an Armenian, then in high favour with Nawab Kazim Ali Khan and distinguished with the title of Ongirg Khan. From him he had the command of a battalion of sepoys, and afterwards obtained from the nawab the addition of another. In this station he massacred the English captives at Patna in 1763. Some time previous to the battle of Buxar, he treacherously deserted Kaisim Ali with his corps, and embraced the service of the Nawab Shuja-ud-daula, who had gained him over by bribes. Upon the nawab's defeat at Buxar, he was entrusted with the protection of the Begams, and remained with the nawab till he had made peace with the English; when, fearful of being delivered up to them, he retired to Agra, and entered into the pay of the Rajah Jawahir Singh; but quitted him for the service of the Rajah of Jaipur, who soon dismissed him on a remonstrance from the English General. He then again served the Jats; quitted them once more, and came to Delhi, from whence he followed the fortunes of Nawab Najaf Khan, in whose service he died. Such are the outlines of the fortune of this man, who had some merit as a soldier, but wholly obscured by a treacherous and blood-thirsty disposition. His corps was continued after his death, in the name of his son and a favourite concubine, who received for their maintenance the sum of 65,000 rupees per month. He died or was murdered in the year 1778 A.D., 1192 H., at Agra, where his tomb is to be seen in the Roman Catholic Burial-ground with a Persian inscription in verse, mentioning the year of his death and his name. Vide next article.\n\nShamru Begam, the celebrated princess of Sardhana, whose original name is Zeib-un-Nisa, was the wife, or rather concubine of Shamru or Sombre. She held an extensive jagir at Sardhana, and died on the 27th of January, 1836 A.D., 8th Shawwal, 1251 A.H., aged 88 lunar years. She was buried in the church of Sardhana of which she was the founder. She was one of the oldest and most sincere allies of the English. At her death she left upwards of six lakhs of rupees to various charitable and pious purposes, and gave instructions for founding a college for young men, to serve on the apostolic mission of Thibet and Hindustan. Captain Mundy in his \"Journal of a Tour in India,\" says that the history of her life, if properly known, would form a series of scenes, such as perhaps, no other female could have gone through.\n\nColonel Skinner had often, during his service with the Maharajas, seen her, then a beautiful young woman, leading on her troops to the attack in person, and displaying in the midst of carnage, the greatest intrepidity and presence of mind. The Begam contracted a lawful marriage in 1793. Her first lord, Reinhardt, who bought her when a young and handsome dancing girl; married, and converted her to the Roman Catholic religion. Her second husband was a French adventurer, a soldier of fortune named Levasseur who commanded her small army. It is of this man that the following anecdote is related, which is wondrous strange, if it be true. Skinner used to say that her husband had become possessed of wealth, power, and a numerous army; of these his ambitious wife coveted the undivided possession, and she then accomplished her purpose. A mutinous disposition, on the subject of pay, having manifested itself among his body-guard, the Begam, then about twenty-five, exaggerated the danger to her husband, and got intelligence conveyed to him that the rebels had formed a plan to seize and confine him, and to dishonour his wife. They, consequently, arranged to escape together from the fury of the soldiery; and at night, started secretly from their palace, in palankeens. Towards morning the attendants, in great alarm, announced that they were pursued; and our heroine, in well-feigned despair, vowed that, if her escort was overcome, she would stab herself to the heart. The devoted husband, as she expected, swore he would not survive her. Soon after, the pretended rebels came up, and after a short skirmish drove back the attendants, and forced the bearers to put down the palankeens. At this instant he (Sombre) heard a scream and his wife's female slave rushed up to him, and exclaimed that her mistress had stabbed herself to death. The husband, true to his vow, instantly seized a pistol, and blew out his own brains. His tomb is at Sardhana.\n\nShamsheir Bahadur I, an illegitimate offspring of the Peshwa Baji Rao Maratha by a Musalm\u00e1n concubine named Mastani, who brought him up in the Muhammadan religion. He was severely wounded in that famous battle which took place between the Marathas and Ahmad Shah Abdali in January, 1761 A.D., got to Dig where Surajmal Jat had his wounds treated with the greatest care, but he died soon after, and was buried at Dig.\n\nShamsheir Bahadur II, Nawab of Banda, was the eldest son of Ali Bahadur, the son of Shamsheir Bahadur I, the son of Baji Rao Peshwa. He succeeded to the territories of his father in Bundelkhand about the year 1862 A.D., but subsequently a pension or stipend of four lacs of rupees annually was granted him in perpetuity by the British Government. He died on the 30th August, 1823 A.D., 24th Zil-Ka'da, 1238 A.H., and was succeeded by his brother Zulfikar Ali Khan.\n\nShams Fakhri, a poet.\n\nShamsheir Khan, a nobleman at whose request a prose abridgement of the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi was made by Tawakkul Munshi in 1662 A.D., 1063 A.H.\n\nShams Shahab Afif, the son of Malik Sad-ul-Mulk who was Amaldar of Dhubar and Dibalpur in the reign of Sultan Ghayasuddin Tughlaq. He was born the very day that Sultan Firoz Shah came into the world, i.e., in the year 1309 A.D., 709 A.H., and was the grandfather of Shams Siraj Afif, the author of the Tarikh Firoz Shahi.\n\nShams Siraj Afif, the grandson of\nShams Shah\u00e1b Aff\u00ed was an historian who flourished in the reign of Sult\u00e1n Firoz Sh\u00e1h B\u00e1rbak, king of Dehl\u00ed who reigned from 1361 to 1388 A.D. He is the author of the entire history of that monarch, called \"T\u00e1rikh Firoz Shah\u00ed,\" in which he relates that when that emperor built the city of Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d adjoining to that of (old) Dehl\u00ed in the year 1364 A.D., 755 A.H., he (the author) was then twelve years of age, and that the red stone pillar in the Koshak of Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d near the mosque or Jama Masjid, was brought by that emperor in the same year with great expense and labour from a place called Naweira in the vicinity of Sitaura near Khizir\u00e1b\u00e1d, a city situated on the foot of a mountain, ninety c\u00f3s distant from (old) Dehl\u00ed, where it then stood. The whole length of this pillar, says the author, was 32 gaz; 8 of which the king ordered to be buried in the earth or sunk in the building and the remaining 24 to be above the surface. This pillar was called by the emperor, \"Minar Zarr\u00edn,\" i.e., the Golden Minar. The second pillar which the emperor set up within his hunting place, called Shikargah Firoz Sh\u00e1h, was brought from Mir\u00e1t, and was somewhat smaller than the one just mentioned. This pillar is now called the L\u00e1th of Firoz Sh\u00e1h. These two pillars were even at that period, as they are now, believed by the Hind\u00fas to have been the hand sticks of a famous hero of antiquity named Bhim Sen. The character engraved round these two pillars, the most intelligent and learned men of all religions were not able to decipher. He also observes that the high Minar in the Jama Masjid called \"K\u00edw\u00e1t-ul-Isl\u00e1m\" in (old) Dehl\u00ed was built by Sult\u00e1n Shams-uddin Alt\u00edmsh.

He defeated and imprisoned T\u00e1j-uddin Eld\u00e1z, king of Ghazn\u00ed who came to L\u00e1hor with a large army in 1215 A.D.

His son Sult\u00e1n Bukh\u00e1ri-uddin Firoz succeeded him. It is supposed that the Kuth Min\u00e1r in old Dehl\u00ed, which is now commonly called the L\u00e1th of Kuth S\u00e1hib because it stands close to the darg\u00e1h of the celebrated saint Khw\u00e1ja Kuth-uddin Bakhtiy\u00e1r K\u00e1k\u00ed, was built and completed by Sult\u00e1n Shams-uddin Alt\u00edmsh some time before the year 1236 A.D.

Fraser the British Resident of Delhi, on the evening of the 22nd March, 1856 A.D., for which act Karim Khan was hanged on the 26th August following, and subsequently the nawab, who after a full investigation of the case, being found guilty, was executed on the 8th of October of the same year at Delhi. Nawab Shams-uddin was the Jagirdar of Firozpur, the town of a large district of the same name, situated at a distance of sixty miles to the south-west of Delhi. He enjoyed a revenue variously estimated at from three to ten lacs of rupees a year. The actual cause of his animosity towards Mr. Fraser, and the reason which induced him to instigate his murder, will perhaps ever remain a mystery.

He was murdered by 'Ala-uddin Mahmud, the son of the Maulwi and thrown into a well 1247 A.D., 646 A.H. He is considered by the Sufis to be one of the most celebrated martyrs of their sect. He was, they say, sentenced to be flayed alive, on account of his having raised a dead person to life. We are told that, after the law had been put in force, he wandered about, carrying his own skin, and solicited some food to appease his hunger, but he had been excommunicated as well as flayed, and no one would give him the slightest help.

His ancestors were \"Rafugurs\" or shawl-darners. At an early age he travelled to the Dakhin, where he obtained employment under the Nizam. He did not, however, remain long at Haidarabad; the reputed splendour of the court of Lakhnau brought him to Audh where he found he had an uncle, the celebrated Maulwi Aha, the residency Wakil during the reign of Nasiruddin Haidar. On the accession of Muhammad Ali Shah to the throne in 1589 A.D., Maulwi Aha was advanced to the post of prime-minister, vide Hakim Mahdi, deceased, and Sharaf-uddaula was appointed residency Wakil vide his uncle, promoted to Maulwi Aha dying soon after, Sharaf-uddaula succeeded him as prime-minister. He held the office up to the time of Muhammad Ali Shah's death, which took place in May, 1842 A.D., when Amjad Ali Shah succeeding to the throne, he nominated his favourite, Amin-uddaula to the premiership, obliging Sharaf-uddaula to retire. By the Resident personally the nawab was so much esteemed that, after he lost office, the Resident, deemed him the fittest man in Lakhnau to manage the very responsible and important concerns of the Husseinabad Imambrah, of which he induced the king to make him \"Wazidkhan,\" or stipendiary. Sharaf-uddaula was known by every one to be the most sincerely attached friend the British had in Audh. He was, therefore, looked upon with much jealousy and rancour by all the courtiers, but especially by Nawab Ali Naqi Khan, the father-in-law and prime-minister of Wajid Ali Shah the last king. Viewing him always as his rival, Ali Naqi often contemplated his ruin, and at one time in league with Nawab Wasif Ali Khan, one of the famous abominables of the court of Lakhnau, he would have compassed his end, as he had succeeded in getting the king to issue an order of banishment against Sharaf-uddaula, with his whole family, but for the timely interference of the Resident who had the order revoked. During the early part of the rebellion (in 1857) the insurgents surrounded his house, insisting that he should become prime-minister of the rebel government. He refused and tried to excuse himself in every way, but they forcibly installed him in the office, which he knew he only nominally held, since Mamum Khan was the ruling spirit with the Begam. On the arrival of General Havelock's force for the relief of the Lakhnau garrison, he was in the Keiser Bagh and received a bullet in the shoulder. When the final grand attack was made on the city by the Commander-in-Chief, which caused the Begam and her party to remove to the Musa Bagh, Sharaf-uddaula took advantage of the confusion and skulked behind, and endeavoured to steal out of the city, when he was recognised by some sepoys, who bound him with cords, took him to Maulvi Ahmadullah Shah, who after starving him for four days had him put to death.\n\nSharif Jurjani, Mir or Sayyad, \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u062c\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646\u064a\u060c whose full name is Sayyad Sharif Ali bin Muhammed, is the author of the \"Hashia Kashahafi\" and \"Hashia Tafsir Anwar-ut-Tausfi,\" also of an Arabic work on philosophy called \"Adab-ul-Sharii,\" and the marginal notes on the \"Sharah Matla-ul-Anvar\" and on the \"Mawakif Azdia\" a work on Jurisprudence in Arabic.

This celebrated beauty has been accused of giving those affections, which a monarch so anxiously sought, to the lowly Farhad, in whose breast her beauties kindled a flame, which deprived him of reason and life. We are told that the son of Khuro, after putting his father to death, sought the favours of his father's mistress; who appeared to consent, but desired to take one look at the remains of his father.

She was a Christian of extraordinary talents and eloquence, and being prompted by an aspiring ambition, she announced herself a prophetess, and uttering her string of rhapsodies in rhyme, declared that they came inspired from above. Struck by her success, Musy-l\u00edma thought it advisable to temporise with her, and accordingly having sent agents, invited her to a private conference, Sijaj consented and came to an interview; she was deceived and having forfeited all pretensions to that purity, which is the highest attribute of her sex, she fell from her proud pre-eminence, and became a mere debased, and contaminated woman. She subsequently enrolled herself among the proselytes of the Kur\u00e1n.\n\nSikandar, Alexander the Great, \u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u062a\u0648\u062d, called by Muhammed in the Kur\u00e1n, \"Z\u00e1'\u00edkharnya\" the Two Horned Man; probably by reason of his head being figured as Ammon, with the Ram's Horns, on coins and medals.

He was captured in the jungles of Perone on the 7th, and hanged on the 18th of April, 1859. It is said that before his death he solemnly affirmed that he was the instigator of the Cawnpur massacre, and that the N\u0101n\u0101 who had sworn to protect the Europeans was angry with him for his conduct and never saw him afterwards. If true, this confession was made evidently with the view of saving the N\u0101n\u0101, when it would no longer injure himself. At his confession Tantia described himself as a Brahman of high caste, a native of P\u012bna, which place he had left about 30 years before for Central India, where he became an Artillery soldier (Top\u012b). He next obtained employment in the N\u0101n\u0101's establishment at Bith\u016br in connection with the Treasury, and was so employed in 1857 when the mutiny broke out. He also said, that he commanded the rebel army of 8,000 men which attacked Colonel Greathed's column on the parade ground at Agra on the 10th October, 1857. He declared he was aware of the arrival of the column from Delhi before he opened fire on the regiment that was advancing, and did not suppose he had only the Agra brigade to deal with, as we imagined. He was deceived, however, after the action had commenced, by seeing a re-enforcement of European redcoats coming up (Greathed's men being dressed in Kh\u0101khi) for whose appearance and apparent numbers (for they were reported to be 2,500 men) he could not account, but supposing them to be new arrivals from down-country, he immediately retreated; otherwise he would have held his ground, and not have allowed Col. Greathed to win so easy a victory. Tantia also mentioned that the largest force he ever commanded was at the battle of Betwa, when he had under him 23,000 fighting men, and 180 pieces of ordnance of various calibres.\n\nTapish, \u062a\u067e\u064a\u0634, the poetical name of Munshi Ghul\u0101m Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u0101n editor of the Newspaper called \"Audh Akht\u0101r.\" He was living in 1871 A.D.\n\nTaqi Aohadi, \u062a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0648\u0647\u062f\u06cc, a Persian poet who came to India and was living at Agra in 1614 A.D., 1023 A.H.

She was elevated on the throne of Persia some time after the death of her brother Sh\u00e9riy\u00e1 631 A.D. We are told by Persian historians that this queen restored the sacred cross, which had been borne away from Jerusalem by Khusro Parwez; and by that act, acquired great power with the Roman emperor. But this is evidently erroneous: for there is no doubt that the emperor Heraclius, when he returned from Persia, carried that precious relic to Constantinople, which was deemed a more splendid trophy of victory, than all his spoils and conquests. Taurandukht ruled Persia only one year and four months. She was succeeded by her second lover Shah Shamanda. He had reigned only one month when he was deposed, and 'Azam Kh\u00e1n Arzamidukht, a sister daughter of Khusro Parwez was raised to the throne 632 A.D. This princess who was alike distinguished by her sense and beauty, resolved to take the whole management of the affairs of the kingdom into her hands. She would not even appoint a waz\u00edr. But the fatal passion of a Persian noble defeated all her designs. Farrukh Hurmu\u017e the governor of Khuras\u00e1n, fell violently in love with her, or perhaps, with her dominions. He proceeded to court and made his love known to his royal mistress; she refused her hand, and he was soon after murdered through her instigation. As soon as his melancholy fate was known to his son Rustam, he collected a large army, and marched from Khuras\u00e1n to Masdad\u00edn. The queen was unable to oppose him; and the young chief revenged his father by putting her to a cruel death. After her demise, Farrukh\u00e1d the son of Khusro Parwez by a female singer of Isfah\u00e1n was raised to the throne, but before he had reigned a month, his days were terminated by poison.

Tughrul Beg and his brother Jafar Beg Daud, were in the service of Sultan Mahmud of Gharni. After defeating Sultan Masud I of Sultan Mahmud in a battle fought in 1038 A.D., 429 A.H., he assumed the title and state of a sovereign at Naishapur. He subdued Irak, took Baghdad, and by its reduction, became master of the person of the Khalifa Al-Karm Billah, who invested him as Sultan of Khurasan, appointed him viceregent or vicar of the holy prophet, and the lord of all Muhammedans. He gave his sister in marriage to the khalifa, and his nephew Alp Arsalan afterwards married the daughter of the khalifa Al-Muktafi. The Saljuk family divided into three branches and settled in Hamdan, Kirman and Rum or Anatolia. Tughrul Beg died after a reign of 25 lunar years 1063 A.D., 455 A.H., aged 70 lunar years, and as he had no issue, he was succeeded by his nephew Sultan Alp Arsalan the son of Abu Jafar Daud. The following are the names of the Sultans of the Saljuk dynasty of Iran or Persia:\n\n1. Tughrul Beg the son of Mikail the son of Saljik.\n2. Alp Arsalan, nephew of Tughrul Beg.\n3.

His brother Massud succeeded him.\n\nTughrul III., a Sultan of the Saljukian family, was the son of Arsalan Shah the son of Sultan Mohammad the brother of Sultan Sanjar. After the death of Sultan Sanjar, 1167 A.D., 552 A.H., Persia continued, for a period of forty years, to be distracted with the wars of different branches of the Saljukian dynasty. The last who exercised power was Tughrul III who succeeded his father Arsalan Shah in January, 1176 A.D., Jamada II, 571 A.H., and after a reign of ten years was seized and imprisoned by his uncle and wazir Kisal Arsalan, who resolved to usurp the throne, but fell by the hand of an assassin in 1191 A.D., 587 A.H., and the kingdom restored to Tughrul. He was, however, after some years defeated in a battle, taken prisoner and executed by Taksh ruler of Khwarizm, 1194 A.D., 590 A.H., and his head sent to Nasir the khalifa of Baghdad. With this prince terminated the Saljukian monarchs of Persia, who had governed that country, from the commencement of his reign of Tughrul I to the death of Tughrul III, 158 years.\n\nTughtasani, vide Tuftasani.\n\nTokaji Holkar, vide Takaji.\n\nTuktamish Khan, ruler of Daasht Kapchak whom Amir Taimur defeated in 1396 A.D.\n\nTulshi Bai, the widow of Jaswant Rao Holkar, vide Jaswant Rao Holkar.\n\nTulshi Das, a Brahman and a celebrated poet among the Hindus.

In the reign of Abdulmalik, 'Ubeid-ullah was sent to Kafa with leave to plunder it for three days; but before he reached that city, Al-Mukhtar, then ruler of that place, sent his forces against him under the command of Ibrahim the son of Alashkar, when after a sharp engagement, 'Ubeid-ullah's forces were beaten and himself killed in the camp.

To give the greater weight to his pretensions, he also took the surname of Al-Mahdi, the director. According to some, also, he pretended to be descended in a right line from Ali the son of Abu Talib, and Fatima the daughter of Muhammad; for which reason, the Arabs called him and his descendants Fatimites. He likewise encouraged himself and his followers by a traditional prophecy of Muhammad, that at the end of 300 years the sun should rise out of the West. Having at length driven the Aglabites into Egypt, where they became known by the name of Maghribians, he extended his dominions in Africa and Sicily, making Kairwan the place of his residence. He sent several of his generals at different times to conquer Egypt, but they were always defeated and obliged to fly to Kairwan. Al-Mahdi reigned in Barbary 24 years, and was succeeded by his son Abul Kasim, who then took the surname of Al-Kayem Mahdi.\n\n'Ubeid Zakani, a celebrated jester and poet, was contemporary with the poet Salman Sawai.

He reigned at Samarqand for 40 years during the lifetime of his father whom he succeeded in March, 1447 A.D., 851 A.H. He was a prince who made peaceful studies the chief object of his life, and had entirely neglected the art of war. He assembled all the astronomers of his kingdom, and the celebrated Tables which are known by his name, viz., \"Zij Ulagh Beg\" were the result of his labours. He is said to have had very large instruments for making his observations; particularly a quadrant as high as the church of Santa Sophia at Constantinople, which is 180 Roman feet. His fate was cruel, he was defeated, taken prisoner, and put to death by his son Mirz\u00e1 'Abdul Lat\u00edf on the 27th of October, 1449 A.D., Ramaz\u00e1n, 853 A.H. It is a consolation to know that this unnatural prince enjoyed the power he had attained, by so monstrous a crime, only for the short space of six months: he was slain by his own soldiers. Ulagh Beg's Catalogue of fixed stars rectified for 1434 A.D., was published by Hyde at Oxford in 1665 in 4to. with learned notes.\n\n'Umar-al-Maks\u00fas, the favourite master of the khalif Mu'\u00e1wiya II, who after his father's death consulted him whether he ought, or not, to accept the khilaf\u00e1t. His master told him, that if he thought himself able to administer justice duly to the Musalm\u00e1ns, he ought to accept it; but otherwise he ought not to charge himself with it. This khalif had scarcely resigned six weeks, when he found himself too weak to sustain the weight of the government, and resolved to lay it down. This he did, and had no sooner renounced the khilaf\u00e1t, but he shut himself up in a chamber from whence he never stirred till he died, not long after his abdication, of the plague, according to some, and according to others of poison. The family of Umayya was so greatly irritated at his proceedings, that they vented their resentment upon the person of 'Umar-al-Maks\u00fas, whom they buried alive, because they supposed that it was by his advice that Mu'\u00e1wiya deposed himself. This circumstance took place in the year 683 A.D., 64 A.H.\n\n'Umar bin-'Abdul Aziz, grandson of Marw\u00e1n I, was the ninth khalif of the house of Umayya. He succeeded Sulaim\u00e1n at Damascus in September or October, 717 A.D., 99 A.H., and died after a reign of two years and some months in February, 720 A.D., 101 A.H., at Dyr Sam\u00e1n. He was succeeded by Yezid II. This khalif ('Umar 'Abdul Aziz) was eminent above all others for temperance and self-denial, insomuch, that according to the Muhammadan faith, he was raised to Muhammad's bosom, as a reward for his abstinence in an age of corruption.\n\n'Umar bin-'Abdul Aziz, was an eminent Musalm\u00e1n who died in the year 742 A.D., 124 A.H.\n\n'Umar bin-'Abdul Aziz bin-Maja, commonly called Hus\u00e1m-uh-Shah\u00edd, author of a most esteemed Commentary.

He succeeded Ab\u00fa Bakr Sad\u00edk as second khalif after Muhammad in August, 634 A.D., Jum\u00e1da II, 13 A.H. He spread his conquests over Syria and Phenicia, and took Jerusalem after an obstinate siege in 637 A.D., 16 A.H. His generals extended his conquests over Persia and Egypt and increased the worshippers of Muhammad. The fall of Alexandria under his power was marked by the destruction of its celebrated library, but he restored the canal between the Nile and the Red Sea. During his reign the Muhammadians conquered 36,000 towns, destroyed, 4,000 Christian temples, and built 1,400 mosques. He was the first who was called \"Amir-ul-Momin\u00edn\" or the Lord of the Believers, and this title was ever afterwards used by all succeeding khal\u00edf\u00e1s. He was married seven times, and one of his wives was Umm Kuls\u00fam the daughter of 'Ali. He was stabbed on Wednesday the 3rd of November, 644 A.D., 26th Zilhijja, 23 A.H., by a Persian slave named Fir\u00f3z whilst saying his morning prayers in a mosque, and died three days after, aged 63 lunar years. He reigned 10 years 6 months and 8 days, and was succeeded in the khilaf\u00e1t by 'Usm\u00e1n the son of 'Aff\u00e1n. Waring in his \"Tour to Sh\u00edr\u00e1z,\" mentions that while he was at Sh\u00edr\u00e1z (1802 A.D.), the Persians (who are Shias) celebrated the death of the khalif 'Umar. \"They erected a large platform, on which they fixed an image, disfigured and deformed as much as possible. Addressing themselves to the image, they began to revile it for having supplanted 'Ali the lawful successor of Muhammad; at length having exhausted all their expressions of abuse, they suddenly attacked the image with stones and sticks, until they had shattered it into pieces. The inside was hollow, and full of sweetmeats, which were greedily devoured by the mob who attended the ceremony.\"\n\n'Umar Khan Khilji, the youngest son of Sult\u00e1n 'Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji a boy of seven years of age, was raised to the throne of Delhi after the death of his father, by Malik K\u00e1f\u00edr the eunuch, in December, 1316 A.D., Shaww\u00e1l, 716 A.H. Malik K\u00e1f\u00edr was assassinated after 35 days and soon after 'Umar Kh\u00e1n was deposed by his brother Mubarak Kh\u00e1n who ascended the throne in January, 1317 A.D., 716 A.H.\n\n'Umar Khayam, He was originally a tent-maker and hence his takhallus of Khay\u00e1m. He is held to be one of the most remarkable of Persian poets, unprecedented in regard to the freedom of his religious opinion. The Voltaire of Persia, his works gave great offence to the priests, but are, nevertheless, highly esteemed by general readers, apparently with justice, as the animation and brilliancy of his style are unquestionable. His hatred of hypocrisy and the tricks of false devotees, appears his crime in the eyes of the supposed pious; his tolerance of other creeds was looked upon with equal suspicion and dislike. He was born at Naishap\u00far, and devoted much of his time to the study of astronomy, of which science he was a distinguished professor; but it is said that, instead of his studies leading him to the acknowledgment of the Supreme Being, it prompted his disbelief. The result of his reflections on this important subject is given in a poem of his, much celebrated under the title of \"Rub\u00e1y\u00e1t 'Umar 'Khay\u00e1m.\" He was the friend of Has\u00e1n Sabb\u00e1h, the founder of the sect of the Assassins, and, it has been conjectured, assisted him in the establishment of his diabolical doctrine and fellowship. Some allowance must, however, be made for the prejudices of his historians, who would, of course, neglect\nnothing calculated to cast odium on one so inimical to their superstitions. 'Umar Khayy\u00e1m seems particularly to direct his satire against the mysticism of Maw\u00e9i, the most exalted poet of his time, though inferior in this extraordinary and incomprehensible style to the later followers of the same school, Att\u00e1 and Ab\u00fa-l-Mulla. However reprehensible his mockery would be if really directed against religion in general, it scarcely deserves the severity it met with, when we consider that it was the abuse he attacked and the absurdities he ridiculed; and as for the incongruities introduced into his poems and he professed love of pleasure, he is only following or rather pointing out as absurd, the contradictions of the mystic poets, which are difficult enough to reconcile to the understanding, whether allegorical or not. The following will give an idea of the style of 'Umar Khayy\u00e1m:\n\n\"Ah! ye who long that, in time's coming night\nYour names should shine in characters of light,\nLet not this duty ever be forgot;\u2014\nLove well your neighbour; do him no despite.\"\n\n\"Ah! strive your best no human heart to wring,\nLet no one feel your anger burn or sting;\nWould you be wrapped in everlasting joy,\nLearn how to suffer, and cause no suffering.\"\n\nSome English versions of the Quatrains by Mr. Edward FitzGerald have been published by Quaritch of London. 'Umar Khayy\u00e1m was contemporaneous with Hasan Sabbah, Nasir-ul-Mulk waqf of Malikshah, and Maw\u00e9i the poet. Khushgo in his Taskir\u00ed is the year of 'Umar Khayy\u00e1m's death 1123 A.D., 517 A.H., and this appears to be correct. Wajid 'Ali in his Matla-ul-Ulum says that he died in 1121 A.D., 515 A.H.\n\n'Umar Mahrami, author of a work called \"Hujjat-ul-Hind,\" written in 1646 A.D.\n\n'Umar Mirz\u00e1, one of the sons of Mir\u00e1nsh\u00e1h the son of Am\u00edr Taim\u00far.

He died after a reign of 26 lunar years and 2 months on Monday the 9th of June, 1494 A.D., 4th Ramaz\u00e1n, 899 A.H. by the fall of a scaffold upon which he stood to see his pigeons flying; aged 39 lunar years.

Four hundred poets and learned men, besides all the students of the university of Ghazni, acknowledged him for their master. Among the works of 'Unsari there is an heroic poem upon the actions of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad.

His corpse lay unburied for three days; at last it was removed bloody at it was, and buried in the same clothes he was killed in, without so much as being washed, and without the least funeral solemnity. The dissensions which arose on the death of the Prophet, with regard to the succession to the Khil\u00e1fat, were revived with renewed fury when, on the murder of 'Usm\u00e1n, the noble and unfortunate 'Al\u00ed succeeded to the dignity of Amir-ul-Mominin; and they eventually caused the division of Isl\u00e1m into two great parties or sects, called respectively the Sunnis, and the Shias who differ materially in the interpretation of the Kur\u00e1n, and in admitting or rejecting various portions of the oral law. The hatred entertained between these rival sects has been the cause of constant religious wars and persecutions scarcely to be surpassed in the history of any nation or creed, and still separate the followers of Muhammad into two classes, by a barrier more insurmountable than that which divides the Roman Catholic from the Protestant.\n\nUsman bin-Issa bin-Ibrahim Sadik, \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0625\u0633\u062d\u0627\u0642 \u0628\u0646 \u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642, author of a collection of traditions in Arabic called \"Gh\u00e1et-ut-Touzih.\"\n'Usman Mukhtari, \u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc, a poet who flourished in the reign of Sultan Ibrahim of Ghazni and was a contemporary of Sheikh Sanai the poet.\n\n'Utba, \u0639\u062a\u0628\u0647, the son of Abu Lahab.

After he had extirpated his rival Jahangir Shah the son of Karaj Yusuf in 1467 A.D. and put all his relations to death, he engaged in a war with Sultan Abu Sa'id Mirza king of Persia who fell into his hands and was slain 1449 A.D. Uzzan Hasan from this event, became sovereign of a great part of the dominions of the house of Taimur. After he had made himself master of Persia, he turned his arms in the direction of Turkey: but his career of greatness was arrested by the superior genius of the Turkish emperor, Muhammad II, from whom he suffered a signal defeat, which terminated his schemes of ambition. He died after a reign of eleven years at the age of seventy on the 7th of December, 1477 A.D., 882 A.H. Catherine Commenus, who is called by the Persians Ceym Commenas, was married to him.

Haidar Ali contrived in the middle of the last century, to get possession of Kurg by treachery; but in 1787 the young raja, Bir Rajindar, his prisoner, escaped from confinement through the aid of several of his subjects and succeeded in establishing himself in his dominions. At his death, in 1805, he left the succession to an infant daughter, to the exclusion of his brother, to whom of right it belonged according to ancient usages; but the young princess soon after abdicated in favor of her uncle, with the sanction of the British Government.\n\nThe Princess Victoria Gaurama was born in February 1841. The melancholy circumstance of the death of the mother, two days after the birth of the child, seems to have led to increased affection for his offspring on the part of the father, who from his own previous convictions in favor of Christianity, determined that his favorite daughter should be brought up in the principles of the Christian faith. From this period the ex-raja entertained an anxious desire to visit Europe, in order that, when she had arrived at a suitable age, she might be introduced into European society; and thereby receive such impressions as would promote a feeling favourable to Christianity. Accordingly in the early part of 1852, the prince quitted India for England, leaving at the city of Benares the rest of his family, consisting of eleven children, with their mothers. On his arrival in England the object of his visit was made known to the Queen, who at once most kindly and graciously consented to become sponsor to the young princess. The baptismal ceremony was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 30th June, 1852, in the presence of Her Majesty, the Prince Consort, and numerous other members of the royal family: the princess received the prefix of \"Victoria\" to her Indian name of \"Gaurama,\" by which she had been called after one of the pagan divinities of her country.\n\nThe princess is said to have become a good scholar under the care of those charged with her education. Her personal appearance was exceedingly interesting and intelligent, and the complexion of her skin but little darker than that what Europeans call a deep brunette.

This monarch is represented by Persian historians, to have been a cruel prince, and we are told, the nation rejoiced when he was killed by the kick of a horse. He died after a reign of 46 years, and was succeeded by his son Bahram V.\n\nYezdijard II, \u064a\u0632\u062f\u06cc\u062c\u064e\u0631\u062f, (the Isidgerutes II of the Romans), succeeded his father Bahram V to the throne of Persia 438 A.D.

He is the I\u1e63tidgertes III of the Greeks, and a cotemporary of 'Umar the Khalif of Arabia. This prince who appears to have been as weak as he was unfortunate, sat upon the throne only nine years; that being the period from his elevation to the battle of Nahawand which decided the fate of Persia, and which from its date 641 A.D., fell under the dominion of the Arabian Khalifs. For a period of ten years afterwards this monarch was a fugitive, possessed no power whatever. He first fled to S\u012bst\u0101n, then to Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and lastly, to Marv where he was murdered 651 A.D., 31 A.H. He was the last sovereign of the house of S\u0101s\u0101n, a dynasty which ruled Persia for 415 years. It is from the commencement of his reign that the Persian Era, which is in use to this day in Persia, is called after him the Era of Yezidjirdi. It began on Tuesday the 16th of June, 632 A.D., 20th Rabi' I, 11 A.H. being only eight days after Muhammad's death.\n\nYezid, \u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0633\u0641\u064a\u0627\u0646, the son of Ab\u016b Sufi\u0101n. He died by the plague that raged in Syria in the year 639 A.D. The mortality both among men and beasts was so terrible, that the Arabs call that year \"\u02bfAm-dil-r\u0101ma\u1e0da,\" or the year of destruction. By this pestilence the Saracens lost 25,000 men, among whom were Ab\u016b \u1e62a\u02bf\u012bda, general of the Saracen army at Syria, Sarj\u0101b\u012bl, ibn-\u1e24asan\u0101 formerly Mu\u1e25ammad's secretary, and Yezid ibn-Sufi\u0101n.\n\nYezid I, \u064a\u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629, the son of Mu\u02bf\u0101wiya and the second Khalif of the house of Umayya. His inauguration was performed at Damascus on the same day that his father died, viz., on the new moon of the month of Rajab, corresponding with the 7th of April, 680 A.D., 1st Rajab, 60 A.H. He was a man of considerable taste and refinement, an eloquent orator, and an admired poet. Some specimens of his composition, which are still extant, display no ordinary powers of mind. The first and the last lines of the ode with which the bard of Persia, the celebrated H\u0101fiz, opens his magnificent D\u012bw\u0101n, are borrowed from Yezid. It was once sarcastically asked of H\u0101fiz, \"How could a distinguished poet like yourself stoop to borrow from Yezid, who was not only a usurper, but also the murderer of Im\u0101m \u1e24usain?\" He answered, \"Which of you, seeing a dog running away with a diamond, would not stop the brute, and rescue the jewel from its unclean mouth?\" By Persian authors, Yezid is never mentioned without abomination, and ordinarily this imprecation is added to his name, \"Lan\u0101\u1e6d-ull\u0101h,\" that is, the curse of God be upon him;\" in reference not to his vices, but to the death of \u1e24usain, the son of \u02bfAl\u012b, whom he first of all attempted to destroy by poison, and afterwards caused to be killed, with all his family, on the plains of Karbal\u0101. Under his khil\u0101fat the Musalm\u0101ns conquered all Khur\u0101s\u0101n and Khw\u0101rizm, and put the territories of the princes of Samarqand under contribution. The motto of his seal was, \"God is our Lord.\" Yezid died on the 31st of October, 683 A.D., 4th Rabi' I, 64 A.H. in the 39th year of his age, after he had reigned three years and eight months, and was succeeded by his son Mu\u1e33w\u0101s II.

He succeeded \u02bfUmar the son of \u02bfAbdul Az\u012bz in 720 A.D., 101 A.H. in Syria, and died after a reign of four years, 724 A.D., 105 A.H.

He ascended the throne of Granada in the year 1338, and his personal appearance and mental qualities were such as to win all hearts. He established schools in all the villages, with simple and uniform systems of education; he obliged every hamlet of more than twelve houses to have a mosque, and prohibited various abuses and indecorums, that had been introduced into the ceremonies of religion and the festivals and public amusements of the people. His attention was also directed towards finishing the great architectural works commenced by his predecessors, and erecting others on his own plans. The Alhambra, which had been founded by the good Mu\u1e25ammad ibn-Alh\u0101mar, was now completed. He constructed the beautiful gate of Justice, forming the grand entrance to the fortress, which he finished in 1348. He likewise adorned many of the courts and halls of the palace, as may be seen by the inscriptions on the walls, in which his name repeatedly occurs. In the year 1364, as he was one day praying in the royal mosque of the Alhambra, a maniac rushed suddenly from behind, and plunged a dagger in his side. He was borne to the royal apartments, but expired almost immediately. The murderer was cut to pieces, and his limbs burnt in public, to gratify the fury of the populace.\n\nYusaf Adil Shah, \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0634\u0627\u0647, whose original name was Y\u016bsaf 'Adil Kh\u0101n, was the founder of the 'Adil Sh\u0101h\u012b dynasty of Bij\u0101p\u016br. He was a nobleman in the service of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h II Bahmani, king of the Dakhin. When the Sultan left this world, and dissensions began to prevail in the kingdom, most of the foreign officers and soldiers attached themselves to Y\u016bsaf 'Adil Kh\u0101n; who, seeing the ministers of Sultan Mahm\u016bd II, the successor of the late king bent on his destruction, withdrew himself from Ahmad\u0101bd\u012bd, with his family and followers, to his government of Bij\u0101p\u016br, and resolving to become the founder of a kingdom, he began to add to his territories by conquest. In the year 1489 A.D., 895 A.H., he, with the assent of Malik Ahmad Bahr\u012b, assumed the title of Sh\u0101h, and read the khutba of Bij\u0101p\u016br in his own name. Y\u016bsaf 'Adil Sh\u0101h died at Bij\u0101p\u016br in 1519 A.D., 916 A.H. of a dropsical disorder after he had reigned with great prosperity 21 years, in the 76th year of his age, and was succeeded by his son Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl 'Adil Sh\u0101h.\nList of the kings of the 'Adil Sh\u00e1hi dynasty.\n\nY\u00fasaf 'Adil Sh\u00e1h, supposed to be the son of Mur\u00e1d II of Anatolia; purchased for the bodyguard at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d from a merchant.

There are various accounts of the descent of Zuhak. Some say he was an Arabian, but descended from Kymours; others trace his descent to Shaddad, and term him a Syrian; and it has even been conjectured that he was the Astyages of the Greeks. All agree in one fact, that he was of a cruel and sanguinary temper. He is described as having had two dreadful cancers on his shoulders, which the Persian fabulists have changed into snakes, whose hunger nothing could appease but the brains of human beings: two of his subjects were slain daily to furnish the horrid meal: till the manly indignation of Kaws or Gawa a blacksmith of Isfahan, whose two sons were on the point of being sacrificed, relieved the empire from this tyrant, and raised Faraidun, a prince of the Pishdadian dynasty to the throne. The fable perhaps indicates an ancient subjugation of Persia by a Median or Tartar tribe who used the serpent, a dragon, for their standard.

On the accession of Bahadur Shah in the year 1707 A.D., 1119 A.H. the title of Amir-ul-Umra was conferred on him with the government of the Dakhin. It was by his aid and intrigues that Jahandar Shah, after the death of his father Bahadur Shah, overcame all his brothers and ascended the throne of Delhi, when he was appointed to be chief Vazir; but after the defeat of that emperor in the battle against Farrukh-Siyar, he was taken up and strangled by order of the latter as a punishment for his conduct. His head with that of the late emperor Jahandar Shah who had also been put to death in prison, were carried on poles, and their bodies hanging forwards across an elephant were exposed in the new emperor's train, when he made his triumphant entry to the palace at Delhi. This event took place in January, 1713 A.D., Zil-hijja, 1124 A.H.

Muhammad is reported to have said to his followers\u2014\"The most learned among you in the laws of heritage is Zyd;\" and the Khal\u00edfas 'Umar and 'Usman considered him without an equal as a judge, a jurisconsult, a calculator in the division of inheritances, and a reader of the Kor\u00e1n.\n\nZyd bin-Haria, \u0632\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u062d\u0627\u0631\u062b\u0629, of the tribe of Kalb, was the emancipated slave of Muhammad who married his divorced wife Zynab.

She was formerly married to Zy the emancipated slave of the prophet. Towards the end of the fifth year of the Hijrat 626 A.D., Muhammad going into the house of Zyd, did not find him at home, but happening to espie his wife, he could not conceal the impression made upon him, but cried out, \"Praise be to God, who turneth men's hearts as he pleaseth!\" Zynab heard him, and told it to her husband when he came home. Zyd, who had been greatly obliged to Muhammad, was very desirous to gratify him, and offered to divorce his wife. Muhammad pretended to dissuade him from it, but Zyd easily perceiving how little he was in earnest, actually divorced her. Muhammad thereupon took her to wife, and celebrated the nuptials with extraordinary magnificence, keeping open house upon the occasion. She died nine years after the death of Muhammad in the year 641 A.D., 20 A.H.\n\nZynab, \u0632\u064a\u0646\u0628 \u0628\u0646\u062a \u062e\u0632\u064a\u0645\u0629, the daughter of Khuszyma, was also one of the wives of Muhammad, and died two months after the preceding one in the year 641 A.D., 20 A.H.\n\nZynab, \u0632\u064a\u0646\u0628, a daughter of Muhammad married to Ab\u00fa'l 'As. This man, who was an unbeliever, was taken prisoner to the battle of Badar, and the prophet would fain have drawn his son-in-law to him, and enrolled him among his disciples, but Ab\u00fa'l 'As remained stubborn in unbelief. Muhammad then offered to set him at liberty on condition of his returning to him his daughter. To this he agreed, and Zyd, the faithful freedman of the prophet was sent with several companions to Mecca to bring Zynab to Medina, where after her arrival, Ab\u00fa'l 'As was released.\n\nZyn Khan Koka, \u0632\u064a\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0643\u0648\u0643\u0627, the foster-brother of the emperor Akbar. He was the son of Khw\u00e1ja Mak\u00e1sid Hirwi; his mother, whose name was Pit\u00e1h J\u00e1\u00f1, was employed as an Anaga or nurse on Akbar in his childhood, consequently Zyn Kh\u00e1n was called K\u00f3ka or foster-brother to Akbar who raised him in course of time to the rank of 4,500. Subsequently his uncle Khw\u00e1ja Hassan's daughter was married to Sultan Sal\u00edm, and became mother of Sultan Parwez.
