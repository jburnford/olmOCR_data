With an extreme length from north to south of about 140 miles and a breadth from east to west varying from ten to fifty, the Rewa K\u00e1ntha has an area of about 4792 square miles, a population of over 500,000 souls or 110 to the square mile, and yields an estimated average yearly revenue of about \u00a3162,710 (Rs. 16,27,100).\n\nBesides lands stretching about fifty miles along the south bank of the Rewa or Narbada, the Rewa K\u00e1ntha includes an irregular band of territory from ten to fifty miles broad, passing north from the Narbada about twelve miles beyond the Mahi, and to the west an isolated strip of land chiefly along the left bank of the Mahi. It is bounded on the north by the Meyw\u00e1r states of Dungarpur and B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da; on the east by the sub-divisions of Jh\u00e1lod and Dohad in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, Ali R\u00e1jpur and other petty states of the Bhop\u00e1var Agency and a part of Kh\u00e1ndesh; on the south by Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r territory and the M\u00e1ndvi sub-division of Surat; and on the west by Anklesvar and Broach, by Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r territory, by Godhra and K\u00e1lol in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, by Th\u00e1sra and Kapadvanj in Kaira, and by Par\u00e1ntij in Ahmedabad. The P\u00e1ndu and Dorka Mehv\u00e1s villages detached from the rest of the Agency lie chiefly along the left bank of the Mahi, between the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and Baroda territory on the east, and Kaira on the west.\n\nThe Rewa K\u00e1ntha Agency contains six large and fifty-five small states. Of the large states, one, R\u00e1jpipla in the south with an area of about 1574 square miles, is of the first class, and five, Chhota Udepur and B\u00e1riya in the centre, and Sunth, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and B\u00e1lasinor in the north and north-west, are second class states with areas varying from 400 to 875 square miles. The fifty-five small states, with an average area of about thirty square miles, include Kad\u00e1na and Sanjeli in the north and three groups of Mehv\u00e1s or turbulent villages. Of the three Mehv\u00e1s groups, Sankheda with an area of 311 square miles, comprising twenty-two petty estates, lies on the right bank of the Narbada, while the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s with an area of 138 square miles and twenty-two small estates, and the Dorka Mehv\u00e1s nine square miles in extent with three estates, are situated on\nthe borders of the Mahi. About one-fifth of the whole Rewa K\u00e1ntha, comprising nineteen states yielding a yearly revenue of about \u00a330,000 (Rs. 3,00,000), is, on account of the minority of the chiefs and from other causes, under the entire control of the Political Agent. Of the nineteen states under direct management, two Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth are second class; the rest are small estates varying in area from four to 100 square miles. The following table shows the chief statistics of the different Rewa K\u00e1ntha states:\n\nRewa K\u00e1ntha States, 1879.\n\n| Name          | Area | Villages | Population | Density per square mile | Houses | Estimated revenue |\n|---------------|------|----------|------------|------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Kad\u00e1na        | 130  | 100      | 12,669     | 97                     | 3002   | 1,000            |\n| Sunth         | 394  | 578      | 49,675     | 126                    | 11,564 | 9,000            |\n| Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da      | 388  | 487      | 74,813     | 192                    | 17,357 | 12,900           |\n| Sanjeli       | 83   | 41       | 3592       | 77                     | 713    | 510              |\n| B\u00e1\u00e1sinor      | 189  | 249      | 41,984     | 222                    | 9684   | 8000             |\n| B\u00e1riya        | 813  | 478      | 52,421     | 64                     | 12,404 | 17,500           |\n| P\u00e1nta and Dorks |     |          |            |                        |        |                  |\n| Mohv\u00e1s        | 147  | 154      | 41,618     | 283                    | 10,350 | 11,200           |\n| Chhota Udepur | 873  | 530      | 62,913     | 72                     | 14,508 | 25,000           |\n| Sankheda Mohv\u00e1s | 311 | 326      | 46,966     | 111                    | 9674   | 18,500           |\n| R\u00e1jpipla      | 1514 | 591      | 120,036    | 79                     | 23,956 | 80,000           |\n| Total         | 4792 | 3494     | 605,647    | 106                    | 113,210| 183,610          |\n\nAspect.\n\nIn the outlying villages to the west along the Mahi, and in the north and south where the district stretches into the Gujar\u00e1t plain, the land is open and flat. But along the east border and, except in the tamer valleys of the Orsang and Heran, over the whole centre of the district, the country is p\u00e1l land hilly and forest-clad yielding little more than the three \u2018ps\u2019, p\u00e1hn, p\u00e1ni, and p\u00e1n, stones, water, and leaves.\n\nMountains.\n\nThough with no high mountains, the Rewa K\u00e1ntha is a hilly district. Its two principal ranges are, in the south the R\u00e1jpipla hills, the west-most spurs of the S\u00e1tput\u00e1s the water-parting between the Narbada and the T\u00e1pti valleys, and across the centre of the district the spurs of the Vindhya range, that running from the flat topped sandstone crowned table land of Ratanm\u00e1l, forty miles west to P\u00e1v\u00e1gad, form the water-parting between the valleys of the Narbada and the Mahi. Within Rewa K\u00e1ntha limits the R\u00e1jpipla hills form a range, bordering the left bank of the Narbada and a high plateau that stretches from this range south. Except a spur passing about eight miles north into the Rewa K\u00e1ntha, the south range of the R\u00e1jpipla hills, that runs parallel to the T\u00e1pti, lies outside of Rewa K\u00e1ntha limits. The north R\u00e1jpipla hills with an average breadth of about twelve miles covered with rather stunted timber and stocked with tigers, panthers, bison and other of the largest sorts of wild game, stretch about forty miles across the south of Rewa K\u00e1ntha. In the east the hills, steep and rugged, rise into difficult peaks. Westwards near R\u00e1jpipla the line is from south to north crossed by the stream of the Karjan and its tributary the Teri, whose waters join close to the new R\u00e1jpipla fort. Beyond this break, the range lower and less marked, gradually falling into a table-land\nstretches west into Broach. On one of the highest peaks, Dev Satia about 2000 feet above the sea, are the ruins of old R\u00e1jpipla, where in troublous times the chief and his followers used to take refuge. The way up, difficult even for footmen, through thick forest and high elephant grass, winds round precipices and ugly ledges. There are still traces of the former capital and on Dev Satia immediately behind are the ruins of an old fort. From Dev Satia the view is wide and beautiful. To the east, ranges of hills rise in endless confusion, to the south the valley of the Karjan stretches through the central uplands, to the west the Narbada winds to the sea, and to the north lies the rich Gujar\u00e1t plain with P\u00e1v\u00e1gad on the horizon. Of the south R\u00e1jpipla hills the only spur that comes within Rewa K\u00e1ntha limits has, unlike the northern range, sloping sides and flat tops. On the east of the Karjan river a ridge of hills stretches for twelve miles from north to south, and to the east of this again lies the S\u00e1gbar\u00e1 range 700 feet high, well wooded and flat topped, peopled by several small Bhil hamlets.\n\nThe Vindhya spurs, that lying east and west cross the centre of the district from Ratanm\u00e1l to P\u00e1v\u00e1gad, are steep about 800 feet high, their tops in some places flat, in others rising into peaks. In the range are several passes, two of them at Kadval in Udepur and near S\u00e1gtala in B\u00e1r\u00edya fit for carts. From Ratanm\u00e1l northwards a chain of hills or more strictly a line of table-land from 800 to 1200 feet above the sea, the water-parting between the Mahi and the An\u00e1s, forms the boundary between the Rewa K\u00e1ntha states of B\u00e1r\u00edya, Sanjeli and Sunth on the west, and the Panch Mah\u00e1ls districts of Dohad and Jh\u00e1lod in the east. This table-land can in many places be crossed by carts. Besides the chief highway, that between Godhra and Dohad mounts the plateau about seven miles west of Dohad, roads run from B\u00e1r\u00edya, Sunth, and other Rewa K\u00e1ntha towns to Dohad, Jh\u00e1lod and Limdi. Between this table-land and the range of the P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hills are many irregular branching timber-covered spurs, steep and high with jagged tops on the east, growing gradually lower as they pass west, and finally disappearing in the basin of the Mahi. To the north these spurs, more regular and unbroken, lying north and south parallel to each other in ranges separated by narrow valleys, form a link between the \u00c1r\u00e1v\u00e1li and Vindhya mountains. Occasionally the traveller may go for miles along the hill foot without finding an opening, and in some parts in moving from one village to another has to make long detours.\n\nSeparated by the central line of the Ratanm\u00e1l and P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hills, are two distinct river systems, the Mahi with its tributary the P\u00e1nam in the north, and in the south the Narbada joined from the right bank by the Men Asvan Heran and Oror Orsang, and on the left by the Karjan.\n\nEntering the district in the extreme north-east corner, the Mahi passes south-west for about 120 miles through Kad\u00e1na, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s. Between steep, fifty to eighty feet high, banks, sometimes rocky but chiefly of clay or conglomerate furrowed by local drainage into deep ravines, the stream of the Mahi seldom\nexcept in floods filling it from side to side, flows along a broad sandy or stony bed broken at times by islands of rock or rich alluvial soil. During the 120 miles of its Rewa K\u00e1ntha course the country through which the river flows changes from wild forest-clad hills and cliffs in the east to a flat bare plain in the west. Its deep banks and in the hot season, its very languid stream, make the Mahi of little use for watering crops. Its stream is too shallow and its bed too rocky to allow of water carriage. Ferry boats are its only craft. Its rich stores of fish are little used.\n\nOf the local tributaries of the Mahi the only one of importance is the P\u00e1nam, that rising in the Ratanm\u00e1l hills after a north-west course of ninety miles falls into the Mahi, six miles west of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. Its broad sandy bed between banks generally about forty feet high, can, except in floods, be crossed by carts at points not more than half a mile apart. After a course of thirty miles north-west the P\u00e1nam enters B\u00e1riya, about forty miles east of P\u00e9v\u00e1gad, then after twenty miles in B\u00e1riya it passes through thirty miles of Godhra, its last eight miles lying in the forest and hill country of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da.\n\nThe hundred miles of the Narbada\u2019s Rewa K\u00e1ntha course may be divided into three parts; the first about thirty miles south-west from H\u00e1mp to the Dev river; the second, about thirty miles north-west through the Rewa K\u00e1ntha to Ch\u00e1nod; and the third, forty miles south-west to Gov\u00e1li about four miles east of Broach.\n\nFrom H\u00e1mp to Gardeshvar about ten miles below the Dev river, through a country of hill and forest, between wooded or steep craggy banks, the stream passes over a channel too rocky for any craft but timber rafts. For the next twenty miles to Ch\u00e1nod, though the right bank keeps steep, the left is low and shelving and the stream is deep and the channel smooth enough to allow the passage of boats of not more than two feet draught. Near Ch\u00e1nod, the right bank, about eighty feet high, is seamed with ravines, the knolls between crowned with villages. The stream is even in the hot weather deep and swift, and in floods swelling forty feet above its fair weather level, it stretches for a mile across the low southern bank.\n\n---\n\n1 Following the course of the stream, the details are, after six miles two small streams join, the Sukna from the right and the Chibota from the left. Four miles further (10) through a 200 feet deep passage between sheer and bluff cliffs and among wild and thickly wooded valleys, the river cuts through three parallel hill ranges that run north to the western A r\u00e1vali spurs. A mile (11) below the pass is Kad\u00e1na, and some miles further Munpur, both difficult fords. About twenty miles below Kad\u00e1na (31) the Bh\u00e1dar a small stream dry during half the year joins from the right; five miles further (36) at Madhv\u00e1s is a steep and difficult ford and nine miles lower (45) a good ford at Haded; about a mile further (46) the P\u00e1nam joins from the south-east; two miles lower (48) at Ch\u00e1mpeli is a difficult and rocky ford, and another also difficult and rocky at Savl\u00ed (52); five miles further (57) the river leaves Rewa K\u00e1ntha, then after dividing Kaira and the Panch Mah\u00e1ls for fifteen miles (72) is the P\u00e1li ford where the great Godhra highway crosses, a ford in the fair season and a ferry in the rains; then eight miles further (80) a good ford at Itva; five miles below (85) Sihora a difficult rocky passage, where from the left the Meshri from Godhra falls into the Mahi; one mile further (86) from the left come the united streams of the Goma and Karad; then at Bh\u00e1darva ten miles lower (96) a ferry; after six miles (102) the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway crosses; and then for twenty miles more (122) the river passes through the west villages of the F\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s.\nthe remaining forty miles the country grows richer and more open, the banks are lower, the bed widens including islands, and the stream deep and slow enough for water carriage, is for the last twenty miles at all times too deep for carts, and for eight is a tidal stream a mile and a half broad where it leaves the district.\n\nThe chief of the Narbada's Rewa K\u00e1ntha feeders are from the right the Men, Ashvin and Or, and from the left the Dev, Karjan, Kari, Madhuvati, K\u00e1veri and Amr\u00e1vati. Passing down the stream, from the left the Dev after an eighteen mile course from the B\u00e1bk\u00e1 tal\u00e1v hills falls into the Narbada, about twenty-five miles below H\u00e1mp. The Dev valley is of special interest from its sandstone rocks and beds of trap ashes. Eighteen miles further, from the right comes the Men, a small stream with a rugged south-west course of about fifty miles from the Chhota Udepur hills. Four miles more from the same side, in size and course much like the Men, comes the Ashvin and six miles more also from the right, the Or or Orsang. This, the largest of its Rewa K\u00e1ntha feeders, rising in the Ratanm\u00e1l hills after a south-west course of about ninety miles through Chhota Udepur, Baroda, and the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, joins the Narbada at the sacred town of Ch\u00e1nod. With banks from twenty to thirty feet high and a broad sandy bed, the Or is, except in times of flood, a small stream. In its passage through the Rewa K\u00e1ntha the stream running twelve miles west, takes a sudden south bend and after thirteen miles again turns sharp north. In this bend stands the town of Chhota Udepur. Beyond Udepur ten miles to the north-west, the Or is from the right joined by the Ain, a small stream with its source in the Ratanm\u00e1l range. Then after twelve miles west it bends south-west and is joined on the right or north bank by the Buraj, a small stream also from the Ratanm\u00e1l range. Twelve miles further the Baroda boundary is reached and for twenty-five miles the Or flows south-west through Baroda till close to the Sankheda village of Bhiloria, it is joined on its east or left bank by the Heran. This river from Ali R\u00e9jpur in the east, with banks from forty to fifty feet high and a bed divided by rocky barriers into long pools, may in the fair season be crossed by carts at every two or three miles. After its meeting with the Heran for seven miles through the Sankheda estates of Shanor and M\u00e1ndva, the Or, shallow in the fair weather, but in floods from forty to fifty feet deep, passes south between steep banks from sixty to 100 feet high. Its meeting with the Narbada is sacred, thousands, especially at the Chaitra (April-May) full moon, coming there to bathe. Four miles below the Or from the south or left bank comes the Karjan, in size the second of the Narbad\u00e1's Rewa K\u00e1ntha tributaries. This stream, rising in south R\u00e9jpipla and flowing north through the central range of hills, joins the Narbada about six miles south of the present capital of N\u00e1ndod. Among the hills its banks, always steep and rocky, are in places impassable and rocky ridges stretching across its bed divide the stream into deep dark pools. Twenty-five miles after it enters R\u00e9jpipla limits, the Mohan brings\n\n---\n\n1 The April - May, Vaish\u00e1kh, springs pass as far as the island of Dev thirteen miles higher.\nto the Karjan the drainage of the most westerly hills. Thirty miles further in the centre of the north-most range of hills close to R\u00e1jpipla, it is on the right bank joined by the Teri. Leaving the hills the Karjan keeps north for six miles and then sweeping to the west passes N\u00e1ndod town, and after six miles more falls into the Narbada near the village of Rund. During its last twelve miles the river bed is from sixty to 100 yards wide, with from thirty to forty feet high banks, steep on one side and shelving on the other. Nineteen and a half miles west of the Karjan also from the south, comes the Kari a small stream formed by the meeting of several water-courses. Eight miles further, off the north end of the Shuklatirth island, comes the Madhuvati, draining north-west from the centre of the R\u00e1jpipla hills. Ten miles beyond, also on the left bank, the K\u00e1veri, a small stream with a sandy bed almost dry during the hot season, from one of the west spurs of the R\u00e1jpipla hills, after a winding northerly course of about thirty miles, falls into the Narbada, four miles east of the Broach boundary. The last of its feeders, the Amravati rising in the R\u00e1jpipla hills and flowing west parallel to the K\u00e1veri does not join the Narbada till below Rewa K\u00e1ntha limits.\n\nThe chief islands in the Narbada bed are: four miles below the Karjan, Vy\u00e1sji, untilled, two miles long by half a mile broad, its ownership in dispute between R\u00e1jpipla and Baroda; fifteen miles lower off the mouth of the Khadi, Div island, a sandy waste, a mile and a half long by half a mile broad; six miles below the Khadi, the Nand island; six miles further off the mouth of the Madhuvati, Shuklatirth, four miles long and one broad, famous for its great Banian tree the Kabir Vad\\(^1\\); and four miles more, west of the K\u00e1veri, an island \\(3\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles long and at broadest \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles, yearly covered in times of flood and yielding the finest crops of tobacco, castor-oil and millet. The chief ferries are at Ch\u00e1nod; at the north end of the Vy\u00e1sji island four miles below; at P\u00e1tma two miles lower, and in the next eight miles at Varkal Oli, Sisodra, and R\u00e1jpur; one and a half miles lower at Asha; and four miles further at V\u00e1sna and Indor. Four miles below Indor is the last place where carts can cross. Except the islands in its bed and the belt of low land on its left bank covered in times of flood, the waters of the Narbada are little used for irrigation. For the first thirty-five miles the channel is too rough to allow of any boats but timber rafts, and in the eastern parts the passage is hard even for them. To the west, boats drawing not more than two feet ply as far as Gardeshvar about seventy miles from Broach. The only trade, and that small, is to Sinor about forty miles from Broach, where a few boats bring salt, iron, and piece goods, and take timber, bamboos, tobacco, grain, and grass.\n\nBesides by the Narbada and its feeders, R\u00e1jpipla is in the west drained by the Kim and Tokri that, rising in the western hills and meeting as they leave R\u00e1jpipla territory, pass west into Broach, and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Details of Kabir Vad are given in the Broach Statistical Account. Bom Gazetteer, II. 355.\nin the south by the Dudan from the S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra hills on its way south to the T\u00e1pti.\n\nThough some of its ponds hold water all the year round, the Rewa K\u00e1ntha is without any large lakes or reservoirs. Of the number of wells no return is available. Almost all the better class of villages have one or two built drinking-water wells supplied with troughs for the village cattle, and in some cases used for watering the land. Bhils and Kolis, as the labour is less, draw water from stream beds rather than wells. The forest parts of the district especially B\u00e1riya and R\u00e1jpipla are rich in streams and springs. But the water, though to look at clear and fresh, is from the quantity of vegetable matter most unwholesome to drink.\u00b9\n\nFrom the form and lie of the land, water readily passes off along the different rivers and water-courses. No part of the district stands in need of artificial drainage.\n\nThe Rewa K\u00e1ntha rocks belong to five classes; metamorphic, quartzite sandstone, cretaceous, trap, and nummulite. In the north and as far south as about eight miles beyond the Or river though the country has not been surveyed, the rock is believed to be chiefly metamorphic, a highly crystalline granite or gneiss\u00b2 sometimes piled in huge dome-shaped masses\u00b3 two or three hundred feet high with occasional beds of limestone and hornblend. Among the metamorphic rocks are a few trap and sandstone outliers, and in the west the granite gradually changes into the quartzite or quartzite sandstone of the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner bed. About eight miles south of the Or river and running north-east and south-west along a waving line almost parallel to the course of that stream, the rock changes from metamorphic to trap. Though in some places trap rests immediately on metamorphic rocks, a fringe of cretaceous rock known as B\u00e1gh or Mah\u00e1dev is rarely wanting along its edge. In the west, covered sometimes with a thick capping of shale, these cretaceous rocks are generally in the upper part more or less pure limestone with organic remains,\u2074 and below, sandstone without fossils. At the top just below the trap, the conglomerates and sandstones inclose in many cases great masses of uncrystallized flint.\u2075 Besides as a fringe between the trap and metamorphic rocks, beds of this sandstone varying from a few yards to eighty miles, stand out in different parts of south Rewa K\u00e1ntha uncovered by trap. The chief\n\n\u00b9 At Ratanpur in R\u00e1jpipla, the water is said to tinge everything cooked in it a dirty yellow. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 268.\n\u00b2 Occasional foliation among the granites, and the want of any general distinction between true granites and the more crystalline forms of gneiss, tend to show that the granite is an original constituent of the crystalline rocks and not intrusive. Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 31.\n\u00b3 Some parts of B\u00e1riya are roughened by off-shoots from the Ratanm\u00e1l hills, plutonic and metamorphic rocks, granite, gneiss, mica-schist and clay-slate with a grayish marble in the valleys. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 93, 114.\n\u2074 The organic remains are specially rich near Kav\u00e1nt and on the Dev river, where are some well marked species of the Ostrea and shark's teeth. Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 49.\n\u2075 These masses of flint are supposed to have filtered through the overlying traps. Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 56.\nof these sandstone inliers are near Kav\u00e1nt about twelve miles south of Chhota Udepur; further west between the Heran and the Narbada; in the bed of the Narbada at Bar and Vadg\u00e1m; and, on the left bank of the Narbada, on its tributary the Dev, where is a capping of shale about 500 feet deep and under it a coarse gritty sandstone at least equally thick. There is no evidence of any great difference in age between the limestone and the trap, and towards the east there is great conformity between them. But towards the west the sandstone has been worn away in so local and irregular a fashion, that it seems to have taken place in the air and not under the water.\n\nThe traps formed of different flows varying greatly in age, may geographically be divided into two groups to the north and to the south of the Narbada. In those north of the river the chief points of interest are; sandstone inliers, beds of trap ash, and occasional trap beds sedimentary in origin but different from the lake deposits of Central India. Among the traps to the north of the Narbada, at Padv\u00e1ni about twenty miles south of Chhota Udepur and at M\u00e1t\u00e1pen\u00e1i hill about twelve miles south-west of Chhota Udepur, are signs of direct volcanic action. Near Padv\u00e1ni a hill of basalt and porphyry with quartz fragments, much disturbed sandstones, large ash beds, and frequent masses of intrusive trap, seems to have been a centre of igneous action, perhaps part of the great volcanic focus of the Rajpipla hills. The hills of volcanic ash are highly fertile, often tilled to the top. In this part of the district, M\u00e1t\u00e1pen\u00e1i hill about twelve miles south-west of Chhota Udepur is a place of geological interest. A craggy peak of highly crystalline grayish trachyte scattered over with huge blocks of granite, this hill would seem to have been the nucleus of one of the Deccan trap volcanoes. An intrusive mass of trap has carried up with it blocks of granite and the highly crystalline structure points to slow cooling. The small veins of granite in the trap are not easily explained. South of the Narbada, unlike the general level of the trap beds to the east\n\n---\n\n1 The details of the most easterly of the Kav\u00e1nt inliers as shown in the Kari stream are, beginning from the lowest: 1, altered sandstone; 2, ferruginous gritty clay; 3, sandstone; 4, alternations of fine and coarse gritty sandstone with bands of conglomerate and sandy clay; 5, fine sandstones; 6, massive grits; 7, massive fine white sandstone; 8, thin sandy shales; 9, hard coarse grits and conglomerates. Here a small fault comes and trap is brought in. Trap continues for forty or fifty feet, then beds similar to the last are repeated and upon them fine massive sandstone with shaly sandstone resting on it. This is the highest bed seen and is covered with trap. Mem. Geol. Sur. VI, 164.\n\n2 At Padv\u00e1ni, about five miles south of Kav\u00e1nt, is a little patch of cretaceous rock. The look of the rocks, the ash beds near, and the trap masses show that this was a fire centre, perhaps part of the volcanic focus of the Rajpipla hills. Mem. Geol. Sur. VI, 170.\n\n3 One flow covers a bed of rounded pebbles, many of them taken from former trap flows. This, it seems probable, is the result of streams hollowing valleys in the trap, and in the time between different lava flows, partly filling the hollows with rolled stones and volcanic ash. Mem. Geol. Sur. VI, 166.\n\n4 About four miles south of Kav\u00e1nt near the village of Chikhli N\u00e1n\u00ed and at Ghantol, about a mile to the west between the trap and the cretaceous rock are beds of sedimentary trap.\n\n5 Mem. Geol. Sur. VI, 170.\n\n6 Mem. Geol. Sur. VI, 172.\nand north, the lines of the R\u00e1jpipla traps are much disturbed. The beds dip at comparatively high angles (5\u00b0-20\u00b0) and dykes are common, some of them of great size, ridges 100 to 150 feet high close together and parallel to each other with a general direction of east-north-east to west-south-west. That the rocks have been disturbed since they were deposited is shewn by the tilting of the nummulitic beds that rest on them. But they were tilted before the time of the nummulitic beds, though it is not clear whether this was due to disturbance or to their original consolidation on a slope.\u00b9\n\nThe signs of disturbance and the great number of dykes seem to show that R\u00e1jpipla was, during the time when trap rocks were poured out, a great centre of volcanic action. Other signs of volcanic action in south Rewa K\u00e1ntha are in the Dev valley, the hardening of the sandstones and the dykes and intrusive masses of trap. In the south-west corner of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha near Ratanpur, the west-most part of the R\u00e1jpipla hills is a fringe of older tertiary beds with nummulite-bearing rocks. The upper part are gravels and sandy clays with agate pebbles often cemented into a conglomerate, the lower are bands of sandy limestone full of fossils and thick beds of iron-charged clay. The fragments of trap and the rolled agate pebbles show how the trap was worn away while the tertiary beds were being formed. It seems probable, though present knowledge cannot settle the point, that these tertiary beds are of different periods, the lower nummulitic limestone and laterite belonging to an earlier epoch than the agate gravels and conglomerate.\u00b2\n\nIn the west are the Ratanpur beds, agate gravels sometimes cemented so as to form conglomerates with bands of clayey or chalky sandstone.\u00b3 Among the agates the only stones of value are found in a small ferruginous stratum, to the iron in which, their colour is probably due. South of the Ratanpur stream very little rock is shewn as far as the K\u00e1veri. In the K\u00e1veri, the rock, except that it has more laterite, is much like that at Ratanpur. At V\u00e1sna on the K\u00e1veri, Major Full James is said to have found specimens of nummulitic limestone. But the latest examination failed to find any limestone stratum and the place may be three miles south at V\u00e1ghalkhor.\u2074 Between the K\u00e1veri and the Amr\u00e1vati, scarcely any rock is seen, the whole country being covered with alluvium. The banks of the Amr\u00e1vati consist chiefly of trap pebbles cemented by carbonate of lime with an occasional nummulitic\n\n\u00b9 Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 58.\n\u00b2 Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 63. At M\u00e1lidipur, a little to the south of Ratanpur in descending order, the series of nummulitic beds is as follows: 1, very coarse conglomerate; 2, ferruginous mottled clay; 3, fine sand with a band of trap pebbles; 4, conglomerate of trap and agate pebbles; 5, coarse sandstone; 6, sandstone; 7, limestone; 8, slightly ferruginous sandstone; 9, coarse conglomerate of trap pebbles. Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 195.\n\u00b3 The following beds are seen in descending order: 1, Calcareous clays; 2, agate gravels and conglomerates with fossil wood; 3, calcareous and argillaceous white sandstones; 4, agate gravels and conglomerates with occasional trap pebbles; 5, ditto with layers of sand and red iron-bearing clay; 6, calcareous clays and pale yellow sandstones with plant remains; 7, alternations of gravel or conglomerate sandstone and red lateritoid clay, with occasional bands of clay of various colours and shales. Each bed represents some hundred feet. It is hard to say if all the beds are regularly placed one on the other. Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 197.\n\u2074 Mem. Geol. Sur.

Between the Amr\u00e1vati and the Kim, laterite and nummulitic limestone are largely exposed. Along the banks of the Narbada and to the west of the nummulites, the rocks are hid by alluvium.\n\nClimate.\n\nThe Rewa K\u00e1ntha rainy season begins in or about the month of June and lasts till the end of September. No rain returns are available but the fall is believed in ordinary years to vary from thirty-five to forty inches. The cold season begins in October and lasts till March. In the forest-covered tracts of eastern Rewa K\u00e1ntha with large areas of land rich in springs, the cold is about January sometimes very severe, ice forming on pools and the crops suffering severely from frost. In those parts the mornings keep cool till the end of April, a cold known from its value to the mahuda flowers as mahudia t\u00e1dh or the mahuda chill. The hot weather lasts from the middle of April till after a good fall of rain in July. The heat is sometimes very severe, the thermometer in the shade in Lunav\u00e1da and B\u00e1riya standing at 108\u00b0 and 110\u00b0. In 1873 the heat was so great that several people died and bats and monkeys fell dead from the trees. Healthy in the open parts, the climate of the eastern hill and forest tracts, especially of B\u00e1riya and R\u00e1jpipla, is very sickly. The chief diseases are malarious fever, eye and skin complaints, diarrhoea, and dysentery. Fever, present throughout the year, is commonest in September, October, and part of November, when the waterpools and rank forest growth of the rains are drying up. Diarrhoea and dysentery, most prevalent in July and part of August, are due to exposure to the wet and damp of the rains. Eye affections are common at the beginning of the rains, and skin diseases, itch, ringworm, and guineaworm prevail throughout the year, brought on by the bad quality of water used for drinking and bathing.\n\n---\n\n1 Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 200.\n2 The details of the V\u00e1ghalkhor section are at the base a thick bed of laterite; next yellow clay; then a bed of pipe clay; next sand passing into limestone abounding in nummulites, gastropoda and other fossils; above the limestone a band of sandstone and then laterite again containing pebbles. Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 200.\n3 Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 201.\n4 Colonel Full James has left the following geological notes of the country from Chhota Udepur south-west to the limits of Broach: Chhota Udepur to Kar\u00e1l\u00ed fifteen miles south-west, a series of low hills, the rocks mica schist with blocks of quartz and felspar, Kar\u00e1l\u00ed black soil and a trap hill; Kar\u00e1l\u00ed to V\u00e1sna ten miles north-west, lightish black loam, a ridge of mica schist, and then deep black loam; V\u00e1sna to Agar twelve miles south-west, a line of sandstone hills, a plain of black soil, and a second ridge of sandstone; Agar to Talakv\u00e1da on the Narbada eleven miles south, no rocks, black soil; Talakv\u00e1da to N\u00e1ndod ten miles south-west, black loam, no rocks; along the left bank of the Narbada twenty-seven miles south-west through back loam cut by local streams. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII, 108 - 109.\n5 The lowest recorded thermometer-readings are 36\u00b0 and 38\u00b0. But cases of frost are well known.\n6 The local belief is, that the climate of the forest or p\u00e1l country suits women though it does not suit men. The men of Sunth on the Chibota river are, the proverb says, as lean as monkeys and the women as stout as asses.\n7 Report of the Apothecary attached to the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Agency, dated 10th July 1875.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRODUCTION.\n\nThe Rewa K\u00e1ntha has a considerable store of mineral wealth. Building stone abounds. In the north a rather low class stone is found near the B\u00e1riya village of Valundi and in the Hadap river, and further north in Sunth, an easily worked bluish stone, said to be better than Porbandar, has been much used in R\u00e1mpur and in the chief's palace at Sunth. Slabs of a black, soft, and smooth stone found by Bhils and Kolis in Sunth are used by barbers for sharpening their razors; the part of the hill where they are found is called the barber's hill; g\u00e1nja gh\u00e1ti. Between V\u00e1sna and Agar, about twenty-five miles south-west of Chhota Udepur, a whitish sandstone found in large slabs would make an excellent paving or building stone. In the south the limestone of the nummulitic rocks is well suited for building. There is also near the centre of the district a good supply of lime from the metamorphic rocks of Chhota Udepur, and from the nummulitic rocks in the west. Of ornamental stone the metamorphic rocks near Chhota Udepur yield four kinds of granite, red, white, grey, and nearly black, and seven miles north-east of Chhota Udepur good specimens of white, yellow, and grey marble have been found. Of minerals near J\u00e1bug\u00e1m on the Or river about twenty miles west of Chhota Udepur, mica occurs in considerable quantities. Iron seems to have once been worked on a large scale along the west limits of the district. Near J\u00e1bughoda about twenty miles east of Udepur the ground is so widely covered with slag and scoria as to point to very extensive iron works. In the south of the district on the west of the village of Limodra about twenty-five miles west of N\u00e1ndod are large mounds of iron slag, evidently from an iron furnace. It contained (1852) out of 100 parts 53\u00b764 of silica, 5\u00b739 of alumina, 10\u00b749 of lime, 28\u00b796 of the protoxide of iron, and 1\u00b752 loss with traces of magnesia and manganese. Further south at Bhilod near Ratanpur, some good iron ore has been found, and at Tadkesar not far to the south of the R\u00e1jpipla border, piles of iron slag mark the sites of old furnaces. Of precious stones there are the agates and carnelians, for which since the days of Ptolemy (150) R\u00e1jpipla has been famous. The agates found in the conglomerate and sandstone rocks to the west of R\u00e1jpipla, are supposed to have been originally formed in trap\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel.

The only agates of value are found in a thin iron-bearing bed, to which they probably owe their special colouring. The pits, generally about thirty feet deep, are entered by holes cut in the sides. Under ground the earth is dug in the ordinary Indian system of rabbit warren-like holes barely large enough for a man to get through squatting. The agates are chipped at the mine, and those thought good enough are taken to Ratanpur and exposed to the sun. They are then burned and again chipped, and if properly coloured sold to stone-dealers, chiefly Cambay Musalmans of the Bohora sect.\\(^2\\)\n\nTrees.\n\nGreat part of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha is forest land. The chief trees are the mahuda, Bassia latifolia, found in the greatest plenty in the districts of Chhota Udepur and Bariya. The timber is much used in house building; the flowers are a chief article of food and drink for the poorer Bariya and Udepur tribes, and from the seeds or berries called dol\u00ed, the dol\u00edu oil is extracted. Teak, s\u00e1gv\u00e1n or s\u00e1g, Tectona grandis, is abundant, but except in m\u00e1lvans or sacred village groves is stunted. The timber is used for house building, the seeds and flowers are given in cases of colic, and the leaves are made into thatch. Blackwood, sisam or sisu, Dalbergia sissoo, is not found in any large quantity. Tamarind, \u00e1mbi, Tamarindus indica, is plentiful, the timber used for house building, and the fruit for pickling. The Mango, \u00e1mba, Mangifera indica, is chiefly valued as a fruit tree. Of the Bamboo, v\u00e1ns, the poles are used for roofing, the young shoots are pickled, and the wheat-like seed is ground into flour and made into bread. The H\u00e1yan, Mimusops indica, is abundant and valuable. Its tough wood is used in making native sugar mills and mortars, and in the hot season large numbers of the poorer tribes feed on its fruit. S\u00e1dado, Terminalia arjuna, timber is largely used in house building and for other purposes. Of the Kh\u00e1khar, Butea frondosa, the leaves are made into platters, the flowers called kesuda are used as a dye, and the wood for fuel. Its gum serves the place of Indian kino. It is given in cases of chronic diarrhoea and is an external astringent application. Of Beheda, Terminalia belerica, the fruit used as a dye is astringent and forms an ingredient in the compound powder used by native doctors, and called triphala. Of the Timbarrun, Carissa carandas, the fruit commonly eaten is believed to lessen the effects of opium. Its wood is\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mem. Geol. Sur. VI. 3, 56, 219.\n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov. Sel.

Its fruit when dry is made into snuff boxes. The pulp of the unripe fruit is useful in cases of dysentery and chronic diarrhoea. *Ch\u00e1rol\u00ed*, *Buchanania latifolia*, seeds are a favourite native spice. *Dh\u00e1vdo*, *Anogeissus latifolia*, wood is used for fuel and the gum is mixed with some medicinal drugs and eaten as a cold weather tonic. *Gugali*, *Boswellia serrata*, a sweet-scented gum, is burnt in religious ceremonies, and sometimes used to strengthen lime. *Alardi*, *Morinda exserta*, wood is used for fuel, and the leaves are given to cattle when grass and forage are scarce. *Kher*, *Acacia catechu*, timber is valuable not suffering from water, useful as fuel, and yielding the astringent substance called *k\u00e1th*, *Terra japonica*. In Bariya, during February and the three following months, *k\u00e1th* making gives employment to a large number of Kolis and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s. Branches stripped of their bark are cut into small three or four inch pieces and boiled in earthen pots till only a thick sticky decoction remains. A narrow pit five or six feet deep is dug and a basketful of the extract placed over the pit's mouth, the water soaks into the earth and the refuse remains in the basket, leaving the *k\u00e1th* in the pit. The extract is then taken out of the pit and dried on leaves in the sun.\u00b9 The *kher* also yields a white powder called *khers\u00e1l* given to cure coughs. The soft wood of the *kaledi* tree is made into wooden plates and used for fuel. *Kalam* or *kadam*, *Stephegyne parvifolia*, sacred to Krishna, is used for house building. *Haldharvo*, *Adina cordifolia*, soft and yellowish is also a useful timber. The Nim, *limbdo*, *Melia azadirachta*, is sawn into planks and used for house building. Its bark serves for cinchona and the leaves are used in fomenting swollen glands, bruises, and sprains. The expressed oil of its seeds is used in cases of leprosy. *Piplo*, *Ficus religiosa*, and *Vad* or Banyan tree, *Ficus indica*, are common. Of the Wood Apple tree, *kothi*, *Feronia elephantum*, the fruit is eaten ripe or pickled, and the astringent pulp is given in cases of diarrhoea and dysentery. *Moheno* wood is used for fuel. *Tanach*, *Dalbergia oojeinensis*, wood is tough and used in cart building. *B\u00e1val*, *Acacia arabica*, wood is used for fuel and in making cart wheels. Its gum is valuable and its astringent bark is used in tanning. Of the Palmyra, *t\u00e1d*, *Borassus flabelliformis*, the juice yields toddy and the leaves serve for thatching. The juice of the Wild Date, *khajuri*, *Phoenix sylvestris*, yields toddy, and its fruit is eaten by the lower classes. Blunt-leaved Zizyphus, *bordi*, *Zizyphus jujuba*, fruit is eaten, and is a favourite food with bears. *Samdi*, *Prosopis spicigera*, is worshipped on the Dasera festival (September-October). Its pods called *s\u00e1ngri* are used as vegetables. Custard Apple, *sit\u00e1phal*, *Anona squamosa*, is chiefly valued for its fruit. *Kanji* or *karanj*, *Pongamia glabra*, yields an oil useful in cases of itch and burning. *Rohen*, *Soymida febrifuga*, bark yields a dark red dye.\n\n\u00b9 Bom.

A good tonic in intermittent fever, it causes dizziness if too much is taken. *Kado*, Wrightia tinctoria, flowers are mixed with curry and taken as a vegetable. The seeds called *indrajuv* are useful in dysentery. The bark, formerly exported to Europe under the name of Concan or Tellicherry bark, is astringent and bitter and is employed in fever and dysentery with much success. *Sevan*, Gmelina arborea, a light wood, is used in making carts and some articles of furniture. *Simlo* wood is soft and is hollowed into canoes or small boats. The fine cotton-like wool that covers its seeds is used for stuffing pillows, and its gum, called *kamarkas*, ground to powder is drunk in milk as a tonic. *Pilwu*, Salvadora persica, berries are aromatic and pungent to the taste. *Rohedo*, Caesalpinia sappan, is supposed to cure a swelling in the belly, and the disease known among native doctors as congealed blood. A tree of this kind is kept with great care by the Raja of Rapipla. *Agathio*, Sesbania grandiflora, flowers are used for food and the bark as a tonic. The seeds of the *Arithi*, Sapindus emarginatus, known as soapnuts, are used in cleaning the hair.\n\nPlants.\n\nThe following are some of the principal shrubs and medicinal plants found in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha forests. *Achyranthes aspera*, the seeds are given in cases of hydrophobia and snake-bite, the juice of its flowering spike for scorpion bites, and the ashes of the burnt plant have been successfully used in dropsy. *Gorakh \u00e1mli*, Adansonia digitata, the pulp is a good refrigerant in fever, and the bark a useful substitute for quinine in low fever. *Kariaturi*, Agathotes chiratta, an infusion of its leaves is used as a tonic and febrifuge. *Samudra shok*, Argyreia speciosa, the leaves are used to foment boils and abscesses. *Shat\u00e1ras\u00ed*, Asparagus racemosus, the root when fresh is a mild tonic. *Golchru*, Asteracantha longifolia, the root is a tonic and diuretic. *Dholi s\u00e1tardi*, Boerhaavia diffusa, the root is said to be a strong emetic. *Erand\u00e1 kakdi*, Carica papaya, the milky juice is reckoned one of the best vermifuges. *Gar\u00e1l\u00e1*, Cathartocarpus fistula, the pod pulp acts as a strong purgative. *Indrak*, Citrullus colocynthis, the pulp of the fruit is purgative. *Dholo \u00e1kdo*, Calotropis gigantea, the root-bark is used as a diaphoretic, an emetic in large doses, and as an alternative in leprosy. *Musli*, Curculigo orchioides, the root slightly bitter and aromatic is used in gonorrhoea. *Amarvel*, Cuscuta reflexa, the stem is used as an alternative, especially in bilious disorders. *N\u00fagar motah*, Cyperus rotundus, the fresh tubers are a stimulant and diaphoretic. *Jangli suran*, Dracontium polyphyllum, the roots are used as an antispasmodic in asthma. *K\u00e1l\u00fa ganthi*, Eclipta prostrata, the root is a purgative and emetic, used in cases of enlarged spleen, liver, and dropsy. *Thor*, Euphorbia nereifolia, the milky juice is given as a purgative, and is put in the ears to cure ear-ache. *Pitp\u00e1pdo*, Fumaria parviflora, the whole plant is used with black pepper in common agues.

Among Rewa K\u00e1ntha grasses the most important are *virun* or *khas*, when wetted a well known screen for cooling hot winds, and elephant grass, *baru*, whose stems are used for native pens, *kalam*.\n\nThe Rewa K\u00e1ntha forest reserves are of two kinds; state reserves, tracts in the large forests where the state only can cut, and sacred village groves called *m\u00e1lvan*, where the finest timber of the district is found. Except for the wants of the state, or when the villages are forced to make good losses caused by some general fire or flood, the fear of its guardian spirit keeps the people from cutting in their village groves. Most villages have two kinds of *m\u00e1lvans*, one never\nChapter II.\n\nProduction.\n\nForests.\n\ncut except on emergencies, the other less sacred and generally felled at intervals of thirty years. The Bariya forests were once famous for their large stores of high class timber. But of late years from the growing demand and the stricter conservancy in the neighbouring Panch Mahals, they have been greatly cut down, and except in the sacred village groves few large trees are left. Except in the eastern Sagbara range, the timber of the Rapipla hills, teak, kher, blackwood, lancewood, sadar, mahuda, and bamboo, is not of good quality. The trees are stunted and damaged by fire. The timber is sent down the Narbada and the Tapti, and by land to Anklesvar, Mandvi, and other British towns. In Bariya the former custom was to farm every year the customs duties on timber exported from the state inclusive of the monopoly of the right of purchase and of the sale of the supplies for export. The contractors could not fell wood, but only buy it from the villagers. The people of the state could buy for home consumption, not for export. After November (2nd Kartik sud) the villagers could export on their own account. Those who bought from the contractors had to pay timber fees. Villagers brought the timber they cut to the Simalia market. At the close of the contract, contractors might carry away free of duty any supplies of timber they had bought. This practice, when the demand increased, led to a very rapid felling of trees. The restriction, that the contractor could only buy and not himself cut, was of little use as he could easily arrange with the villagers to have such trees as he wished cut down. The result was that all good-sized trees disappeared. The villagers suffered as they were seldom able to export on their own account and generally sold very cheaply to the contractors. This contract system has now been discontinued and the people are allowed on payment of a fee on each cartload to fell timber from places not reserved, and export it for sale. People from other districts have to pay an additional fee called van katari.\n\nAnimals.\n\nThe domestic animals of the district are buffaloes, cows, horses, camels, asses, sheep, goats, cats and dogs. The cultivating classes keep cows and buffaloes. Brahmins and other townspeople prefer cows to buffaloes as less costly. Bullocks are chiefly kept by the cultivators as the country is too rough for bullock carriages. Vanias and others, who have to go into the rural parts of the district instead of driving, ride ponies. Some Musalmans keep camels and let them out for carrying goods. Besides by potters and rice-beaters, asses are much used as beasts of burden. Every year after October, divali, camel-men called Raykas or Rabaris bring camels from Meywar and Malwa to graze in Lunavada, Sunth and Bariya, paying a fee of two young camels the herd, and return a little before the rains. So too Charans from Kathiawar bring buffaloes and settle in good grazing villages. Bharvads and Rabaris keep goats and sheep.\n\n1 Col. Anderson, Bariya Administration Report, 1865-66.\n2 On a cartload of teak Rs. 3-4; of bamboos Rs. 1-8; of sadar wood Rs. 1-8; of other wood Rs. 1-4. On a cartload of timber bought by people of other districts from the contractors at the Simalia wood station, Rs. 1-6. On a cartload of rafters Rs. 1-2.\n3 On a cartload of teak Rs. 3, and less for other timber.\nExcept among Bhils, who look on them as witches, cats are found in every house. Some of the Bhils have dogs of a better breed than the common village pariah.\n\nThough all traces of them have long disappeared, wild elephants were as late as the seventeenth century found in the R\u00e1jpipla and Chhota Udepur forests. Tigers and hill panthers, though yearly becoming fewer, are still found in considerable numbers. A common way of killing tigers is to stuff the carcase of an animal he has killed with *minia kodra*, Paspalum scrobiculatum. Eating this the tiger becomes giddy and is either beaten to death with clubs or shot by arrows. Another plan is, near where tigers come to drink, to build a small hollow brick and cement pillar furnished with loop-holes. In this, large enough for a man but too small for a tiger, the hunter hides, and through the loop-hole shoots the tiger when he comes to drink. Bears and wild hog are common in the forests. Of deer, *s\u00e1mbar*, *Rusa aristotelis*; spotted deer, *chital*, *Axis maculatus*; blue bull, *nilg\u00e1i*, *Portax pictus*; and *chink\u00e1ra*, *Gazella benettii*, are found over great part of the district; and bison, *harna bhensa*, *Bos gav\u0153us*, in the S\u00e1g\u00e1b\u00e1ra forests in the extreme south-east.\n\nThe cock and hen, reared by Kolis and Bhils, are the only domestic fowls found in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha.\n\nOf game birds the Painted Sand Grouse, *Pterocles fasciatus*, though properly belonging to open country, are often found in the forest. Common Sand Grouse, *Pterocles exustus*, are found in great numbers in barren, sandy, or rocky tracts. The Red Spur Fowl, *jalkukdi*, *Galloperdix spadiceus*, are found in thick forests. The Painted Partridge, *l\u00e1l titar*, *Francolinus pictus*, and the Grey Partridge, *titar*, *Ortygornis ponticerianus*, are common everywhere. Of quail the common Bush Quail, *l\u00e1vri*, *Perdicula asiatica*, the large Grey Quail, *Coturnix communis*, the Black Breasted or Rain Quail, *Coturnix coromandelica*, and the Bustard Quail, *Turnix taigoor*, are common everywhere. Of snipe the Common, *Gallinago scolopacina*, the Jack, *Gallinago gallinula*, and the Painted, *Rhynch\u00e6a bengalensis*, are found. Of geese there are the Black Goose, *nuktah*, *Sarcidiornis melanotus*, and a smaller sort, name unknown. Of teal the Cotton, *Nettopus coromandelianus*, the Whistling, *Dendrocygna javanica*, the Common, *Querquedula crecca*, and the Blue-winged or Garganey, *Querquedula ciricia*, are common. The Ruddy Shieldrake or Br\u00e1hminy duck, *Casarca rutila*, is found on large rivers. The Shoveller, *Spatula clypeata*, the Grey Duck, *Anas pacilorrhyncha*, the Widgeon, *Mareca penelope*, and the Pochard are well known. Florican, *karmar*, *Syphoetides auritus*, are found in the west of R\u00e1jpipla, and Pea-fowl in all the forests.\n\nOf the Mahi and Narbada fish, some details are given in the\n\n---\n\n1 Large elephants were formerly hunted in the territories of R\u00e1jpipla.

Those of chief importance are the m\u00e1hsir, marel, p\u00e1lva, boi, dangri, roi, surmai, and zinga.\n\nThe alligator, magar, abounds in the large rivers, and from his boldness and greed is often the terror of a whole neighbourhood. Collecting where bodies are burned in the hope of having part of a half-burned body thrown into the river, they press to the shore so boldly that according to native belief they sometimes dash water on the pyre and carry away the unconsumed corpse. They also seize cattle and sometimes children, or even grown men and women.\n\nThe stores of fish in the large rivers are made little use of. So great is the influence of the higher class of Hindus that professional fishermen, M\u00e1chhis, can practise their calling only by stealth. There is no trade in fish, and the M\u00e1chhis earn a living either as ferrymen or peasants. Besides M\u00e1chhis and Bhois fishermen by caste, Kolis, Bhils and other of the lower fish-eating tribes net fish, especially when a pond overflows, or when a small water-course is flooded with rain water. The nets and the way of catching fish do not differ from those used in Broach and Kaira.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nUntil 1872, the Rewa K\u00e1ntha people were never numbered. The 1872 census showed a total population of 505,732 souls or 105 to the square mile. Of the whole number 485,423 or 95\u00b798 per cent were Hindus; 20,104 or 3\u00b798 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns; 198 P\u00e1rsis; 5 Christians; and two were brought under the head 'Others.'\n\nThe following tabular statement gives for the year 1872 details of the population of each state under the Agency, according to religion, age, and sex:\n\n| State          | Not more than 12 years | Above 12 and not more than 30 years | Above 30 years | Total | Grand Total |\n|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------------|\n|                | Males | Females | Males | Females | Males | Females | Males | Females | Persons |\n| Kad\u00e1na        | 2629  | 1944    | 2570  | 2106    | 1697  | 1445    | 6886  |         | 5495    | 12,381   |\n| Sunth         | 9309  | 8541    | 9902  | 8322    | 6591  | 5972    | 25,802|         | 22,835   | 48,697   |\n| Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da      | 15,131| 12,633  | 14,183| 11,117  | 9456  | 9205    | 36,770|         | 32,955   | 71,725   |\n| Sanjeli       | 435   | 367     | 518   | 442     | 394   | 328     | 1347  |         | 1,137    | 2,484    |\n| B\u00e1li\u00e1sinor    | 8130  | 6,709   | 7446  | 5559    | 6237  | 4930    | 20,611|         | 17,218   | 37,829   |\n| B\u00e1r\u00edya        | 3828  | 3328    | 3,611 | 2,819   | 8617  | 7,014   | 24,356|         | 21,809   | 46,165   |\n| P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s  | 8,213 | 8,496   | 7,837 | 6,542   | 5693  | 5,924   | 21,803|         | 18,405   | 40,208   |\n| Chhota Udepur | 10,907| 9,424   | 12,071| 10,918  | 9918  | 8,325   | 32,896|         | 28,485   | 61,381   |\n| Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s| 9214 | 8,016   | 8,388 | 7,630   | 6240  | 5,397   | 23,840|         | 21,043   | 44,883   |\n| R\u00e1jpipla      | 21,040| 19,847  | 19,329| 17,029  | 19,818| 17,562  | 60,187|         | 54,438   | 114,625  |\n| Political Agent's Camp | ... | ... | 47   | 4       | 22    | 1       | 69    |         | 5        | 74       |\n\nTotal         | 93,904| 82,055  | 91,558| 78,648  | 73,703| 65,525  | 259,165| 226,258 | 486,423  |\n\n1 The pressure of population varies considerably in the different states. It is greatest in B\u00e1li\u00e1sinor with 222 and least in Sanjeli with 77. The tract of country running north from the Narbada through Chhota Udepur, B\u00e1r\u00edya and Sanjeli, is the most thinly peopled, the inhabitants being almost exclusively Bhils, and the square mile pressure varying from 77 in Sanjeli to 72 in Chhota Udepur. Next as regards fewness of people comes Kad\u00e1na with 97 inhabitants to the square mile. Although for the greater part covered with hills and forests peopled entirely by Bhils with hardly sixty inhabitants to the square mile R\u00e1jpipla, having some five thickly populated districts on the banks of the Narbada, has an average density of 79 souls to the square mile. In the states bordering on the Mahi there is a marked increase in the population: in the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s the pressure is 283 to the square mile; in B\u00e1li\u00e1sinor further north, 222; in the adjoining state of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, through which the Mahi passes, 192; and in Sunth further to the eastward, 126. The variation of population within a very short distance is remarkable. Thus in the Borsad sub-division of the Kaira district, which borders on the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s, the density is 749 to the square mile, while in the latter it is only about 283, and in the state of B\u00e1r\u00edya, the shortest distance between which and Borsad is not more than thirty miles, the population to the square mile is under 65.\n### Chapter III.\n\n#### Population.\n\n**Rewa

percentage of males on the total population was 53\u00b741 and of females 46\u00b759. Hindu males numbered 259,165 or 53\u00b738 per cent, and Hindu females numbered 226,258 or 46\u00b762 of the total Hindu population; Musalm\u00e1n males numbered 10,797 or 53\u00b771 per cent, and Musalm\u00e1n females 9307 or 46\u00b729 per cent of the total Musalm\u00e1n population; Parsi males numbered 120 or 60\u00b760 per cent, and Parsi females 78 or 39\u00b740 per cent of the total Parsi population; all the five Christians were males.\nThe total number of infirm persons was returned at 2081 (males 2119, females 862), or forty-two per ten thousand, of the total population. Of these 48 (males 29, females 19), or one per ten thousand, were insane; 296 (males 184, females 112), or six per ten thousand, idiots; 432 (males 296, females 136), or nine per ten thousand, deaf and dumb; 1011 (males 481, females 530), or twenty per ten thousand, blind, and 294 (males 229, females 65), or six per ten thousand, lepers.\n\nThe following tabular statement gives the number of the members of each religious class of the inhabitants according to sex at different ages, with, at each stage, the percentage on the total population of the same sex and religion.

Of the Parsis 132, or 66\u00b767 per cent of the total Parsi population, were Shahanshahs and 66 or 33\u00b733 per cent Kadmis. The five Christians were all Roman Catholics.\n\nOccupation.\n\nAccording to occupation the census returns for 1872 divide the whole population into seven classes\u2014\n\nI.\u2014Employed under Government, or Municipal, or other local authorities, numbering in all 5437 or 1\u00b77 per cent of the entire population.\nII.\u2014Professional persons 3288 or 0\u00b765 per cent.\nIII.\u2014In service or performing personal offices 4672 or 0\u00b792 per cent.\nIV.\u2014Engaged in agriculture and with animals 125,931 or 24\u00b79 per cent.\nV.\u2014Engaged in commerce and trade 4365 or 0\u00b786 per cent.\nVI.\u2014Employed in mechanical arts, manufactures, and engineering operations, and engaged in the sale of articles manufactured or otherwise prepared for consumption 40,705 or 8 per cent.\nVII.\u2014Miscellaneous persons not classed otherwise (a) 183,878, and children 182,505, in all 316,383 or 62\u00b756 per cent; and (b) miscellaneous persons 4951 or 0\u00b798 per cent; total 321,334 or 63\u00b754 per cent.\n\nHindus.\n\nPriests.\n\nThe following gives some details of the different castes and races.\n\nUnder Br\u00e1hmans came twenty divisions: N\u00e1gar, with four subdivisions, Vadnagara, Visnagara, S\u00e1thodra, and Chitroda; Audich, with two sub-divisions, Sahasra and Tolakia; Mev\u00e1da, with two subdivisions, Bhat and Trivedi; Modh; Shrigaud; Khed\u00e1v\u00e1l; Khad\u00e1yata; Udamb\u00e1r; Rodhv\u00e1l; Shrim\u00e1li; Gomt\u00edv\u00e1l; Bh\u00e1thela or An\u00e1vla; N\u00e1ndoda; Chovisa; Mot\u00e1la; R\u00e1yathala; R\u00e1yakv\u00e1l; Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans, with three sub-divisions, Deshashth, Konkanasth, and Karh\u00e1da; K\u00e1yatia; and Tapodhans. In proportion to its size, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da contains more Br\u00e1hmans than any other state under the Agency, having 7976 Br\u00e1hmans and an area of 388 square miles. B\u00e1riya with 813 square miles had only 431. R\u00e1jpipla, with 1514 square miles had only 4360, Sunth, nearly the same in area as Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, had but 700, and Chhota Udepur with 873 square miles only 276. Most Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da Br\u00e1hmans follow secular pursuits. Those at R\u00e1jpipla and the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s are principally attached to the various shrines and temples on the banks of the Narbada. The Vadnagara N\u00e1gars came into the Rewa K\u00e1ntha for Government service. They are very few in number, and are generally well off. The Visnagara N\u00e1gars, almost entirely confined to the town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, are divided into two parts, local, Talabda, and settlers from Idar, Idariya. These eat together, but do not intermarry. During the rainy, and a part of the cold season, many of them go to the petty states of M\u00e1lwa and Central India, and recite Veds and Pur\u00e1ns. Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da is the only place in Gujar\u00e1t, where a large number of Atharvan Vedic Br\u00e1hmans of this class are found. Some of these act as bankers and traders, and are tolerably well-to-do. The S\u00e1thodra N\u00e1gars are only found in\nthe town of Ch\u00e1nod on the Narbada, and are poor, living mostly on alms. The Chitroda N\u00e1gars probably came into the Rewa K\u00e1ntha on Government service. The Audich Sahasras are very numerous in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, N\u00e1ndod, and the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, and are tolerably well off. The Audich Tolak\u00edas, mostly found in B\u00e1riya, are seceders from the Audich Sahasras and seem to have come from the Kaira district. The Trivedi Mev\u00e1d\u00e1s, chiefly found in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, are mostly peasants. As a class they are poor, many of them going every year to Baroda, where they earn their living as water-carriers. They spend large sums in caste feasts, mel\u00e1v\u00e1s, considering it a great honour to offer their guests clarified butter. This honour is so much coveted that people frequently ruin themselves in their efforts to be enrolled among the upper 27\u00bd, s\u00e1di satt\u00e1vis, who have the privilege of giving their guests butter. The Bhat Mev\u00e1d\u00e1s, much fewer in number than the Trivedis, are also poor. The Modhs, regarded as experts in the art of begging, are mostly found in the town of B\u00e1lasinor. They travel over the whole of Gujar\u00e1t, and even as far as Bombay, and obtain alms by many tricks. A few of them are now in Government service, especially in the education department. The Shrigaud Br\u00e1hmans; divided into two sects new, nava, and old, juna, are famous for their power of drinking melted clarified butter, gh\u00fa. This power they attribute to the favour of their goddess, a lamp decked with flowers and ornaments, and set in the midst of the butter drinkers. At their marriage feasts, these Br\u00e1hmans for fun make some of the bridegroom\u2019s party wear beards and mustachios, fasten wheat and pease-meal cakes, vad\u00e1s, with holes in the centre to their ears, put conical hats of kh\u00e1lkhra, Butea frond\u00f3sa, leaves on their heads, and on the hat a lighted lamp, and break wafer biscuits, p\u00e1pad, over their heads. The Kh\u00e9d\u00e1val Br\u00e1hmans have lately settled in the district for service or trade; they are well-to-do. The Khad\u00e1yata Br\u00e1hmans act as priests, gors, to V\u00e1ni\u00e1s of the same name. The Udambars, priests, gors, of the Nima V\u00e1ni\u00e1s are few in number, and are said to have come from S\u00e1ml\u00e1i in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha state of Idar. Of the Rodhv\u00e1l Br\u00e1hmans very little is known. The Shrim\u00e1lis act as priests to the Shrim\u00e1li V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, and are in middling circumstances. The Gomtv\u00e1lis, chiefly cultivators, are found mostly in the town of R\u00e1mpur in Sunth. The Bh\u00e1th\u00e9l\u00e1s, or An\u00e1vl\u00e1s, are settlers from the Surat district. The N\u00e1ndoda Br\u00e1hmans, named after the town of N\u00e1ndod, are found in R\u00e1jpipla and the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, and are mostly poor. Not much is known of the two classes, Mota and N\u00e1na, into which the Chov\u00eds\u00e1s are divided. The Mot\u00e1l\u00e1s are also settlers from the Surat district. The R\u00e1yathal\u00e1s, originally settlers from Bik\u00e1n\u00edr or Thali in M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, are mostly found in the town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. They are disliked and the sight of them thought ill-omened. The R\u00e1yakv\u00e1lis are beggars from the neighbouring districts. The Mar\u00e1tha Br\u00e1hmans have come into the Rewa K\u00e1ntha on service and are well-to-do. The K\u00e1yat\u00ed\u00e1s are regarded as low class Br\u00e1hmans, and perform funeral rites for Shudras. The Tapodhans, worshippers of Shiv, if Br\u00e1hmans at all, are Br\u00e1hmans of the lowest class. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, where they are found in considerable numbers, most are peasants.\nThe Rajputs of the district are, according to their class and the places they come from, divided into the following thirty-seven sub-divisions: Virpura or Solanki; Parm\u00e1r; R\u00e1thod; Choh\u00e1n; D\u00e1bhi; Puravia; V\u00e1ghela; Gohil; Dia; Kachhotia; T\u00e1nk; Chud\u00e1vat; Rihar; Sisodia; Makv\u00e1na; Gujar; Dodia; Ghelot; R\u00e1val; Vedia; Padi\u00e1r; Jodha; Khunt\u00e1r; Cham\u00e1rpa; Mohal; Padh\u00e1r; Bh\u00e1ti; Khav\u00e1s; H\u00e1da; Jadia; B\u00e1rad; Bihola; R\u00e1na; Sojantria; K\u00e1rodi\u00e1; Jalia; and Vadv\u00e1sia. In proportion to its size, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da contains a larger number of Rajputs than any other state under the Agency. Many of this class, chiefly relations of the different chiefs, are large landholders; the rest are peasants, soldiers, and messengers.\n\nUnder Mercantile, Trading, and Shop-keeping classes came the V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, belonging to fourteen divisions: Porv\u00e1d; Nim\u00e1; Khad\u00e1yata; Mev\u00e1da; Shrim\u00e1li; N\u00e1g\u00e1r; V\u00e1yada; Umad; Osv\u00e1l; M\u00e1ru; Desh\u00e1v\u00e1l; Modh; Jh\u00e1rola; and L\u00e1d. Many of these classes are divided into Dasa and Visa. The Porv\u00e1ds are mostly found in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth. Some of them are Shr\u00e1vaks. The Nim\u00e1s are numerous in B\u00e1riya, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and B\u00e1las\u00ednor, and are partly Shr\u00e1vaks and partly Meshris. Among the Khad\u00e1yat\u00e1s marriageable girls are scarce, and consequently large sums have to be paid to the bride\u2019s father. Some of the Mev\u00e1d\u00e1s in the town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da are goldsmiths by profession, and are known by the name of their craft. The Shrim\u00e1lis are partly Shr\u00e1vaks and partly Meshris. Some of these also follow the occupation of goldsmiths. The N\u00e1gars are not numerous. V\u00e1yad\u00e1s are tolerably well off. The Umads are immigrants from Meyw\u00e1r. The Osv\u00e1ls are all of them Shr\u00e1vaks. The M\u00e1rus are said to have come into the district from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. The Desh\u00e1v\u00e1ls are not found in large numbers. The Modhs, found chiefly in R\u00e1jpipla and the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, are mostly oilmen by profession, and are therefore called Gh\u00e1nchis. The Jh\u00e1rol\u00e1s and L\u00e1ds are only met with in the southern parts of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha.\n\nOf Cultivators there were five classes: Kanbis, with four sub-divisions, Leva, Kadva, \u00c1njna, and Mar\u00e1tha; K\u00e1chhi\u00e1s, with two sub-divisions, P\u00e1daria and Sag\u00e1ria; M\u00e1lis; Pateliy\u00e1s; and Rajputs. The K\u00e1chhi\u00e1s and M\u00e1lis cultivate gardens, growing flowers and vegetables. The Pateliy\u00e1s are said to have come from Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, and are believed to be the descendants of Rajputs. They are divided into four classes, Parm\u00e1r, Solanki, Choh\u00e1n and Gohil. At marriages they have the peculiar custom that the bride\u2019s mother touches the bridegroom\u2019s head with a yoke and some other field tools, before he enters the house prepared for him by the bride\u2019s father. They use animal food and worship K\u00e1li, the goddess of the P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hill.\n\nOf Manufacturers there were two classes, Gh\u00e1nchis, oil pressers and Chhip\u00e1s, calenders.\n\n---\n\n1 Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, 388 square miles, 2577 Rajputs; R\u00e1jpipla, 1514 square miles, 5893; B\u00e1riya, 813 square miles, 542; Chhota Udepur, 873 square miles, 2407; Sunth, 394 square miles, 626; and Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, 311 square miles, 4843.\nOf Artisans there were ten classes: Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters, with two sub-divisions, Deshi and M\u00e1rv\u00e1di; Suth\u00e1rs, carpenters, with two sub-divisions, Mev\u00e1da and Vaishya; Sonis, goldsmiths; Darjis, tailors; Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; Kans\u00e1r\u00e1s, coppersmiths; Sal\u00e1ts, masons; Chun\u00e1r\u00e1s or Kadiy\u00e1rs, bricklayers; Khar\u00e1dis or Sar\u00e1ni\u00e1s, turners; and Lakh\u00e1r\u00e1s, makers of lac bangles.\n\nOf Bards there were two classes, Bh\u00e1ts, bards, and Ch\u00e1rans, genealogists.\n\nOf Personal Servants there were two classes; Haj\u00e1ms, barbers, belonging to four sub-divisions, Limbochia, Bh\u00e1tia, M\u00e1lvi, and Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed; and Dhobhis, washermen.\n\nOf Herdsmen and Shepherds there were two classes, Bharv\u00e1ds, keepers of goats and sheep; and Rab\u00e1ris, who rear camels and cattle.\n\nOf Fishers and Sailors there were two classes, M\u00e1chhis and Bhois. Besides fishing, the M\u00e1chhis till land, and act as ferrymen across the Mahi in the rainy season. The Bhois also till land, grow shingod\u00e1s, Trapa bispinosa, in the beds of ponds, carry palanquins, and by means of large earthen pots, gol\u00e1s, ferry passengers across the river P\u00e1nam near the town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da.\n\nUnder Labourers and Miscellaneous Workers came fifteen classes; Kandois, sweetmeat sellers; Bh\u00e1dbhunj\u00e1s, grain parchers; Gol\u00e1s, rice pounders; Pinj\u00e1r\u00e1s, cotton cleaners; Ods, well-diggers; Kal\u00e1ls, liquor-sellers; Dalv\u00e1dis, brickmakers; Thor\u00eds, makers of wooden combs and plates and beggars; V\u00e1ghris, fowlers, hunters, and beggars; R\u00e1vali\u00e1s, cotton tapemakers and beggars; Baj\u00e1ni\u00e1s, acrobats; Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s, grain carriers; Lab\u00e1n\u00e1s; N\u00e1iks; Bhartharis and Hijd\u00e1s, beggars. Besides their ordinary business, the Gol\u00e1s sell rice and carry it on donkeys. The Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s carry merchandise on pack bullocks, and also trade in grain and salt. They and the closely allied tribes of Lab\u00e1n\u00e1s and N\u00e1iks have settled in some of the B\u00e1riya villages, where they till land. The Bhartharis play on a kind of rude violin, and sing songs, particularly in praise of king Bhartrihari, from whom they are named. The Hijd\u00e1s, hermaphrodites and eunuchs, are singers.\n\nOf Workers in Leather, there were six classes: Mochis, shoemakers; Dabgars, makers of leather jars; Kh\u00e1lp\u00e1s, Bh\u00e1mbhis, and Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s, tanners; and T\u00edrgars, who make arrows and carry away dead cattle.\n\nBesides the three classes of tanners and the T\u00edrgars, there were four Depressed Castes: Dheds, weavers of coarse cloth; Garud\u00e1s, Dhed priests; Tur\u00eds, Dhed minstrels; and Bhangi\u00e1s, sweepers and makers of bamboo baskets and mats.\n\nThere were Devotees and Religious Beggars of various names, such as Sany\u00e1sis, Gos\u00e1is, Kh\u00e1khis and S\u00e1dhus. The Kh\u00e1khis have a monastery, math, called N\u00e1th B\u00e1v\u00e1no Akh\u00e1do, at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, which has acquired much local celebrity. It has an important branch at Ahmedabad called Nilkanthno Akh\u00e1do. Of Gos\u00e1i monasteries, maths, those at Sarsan in Suth, and Ch\u00e1vadia in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, are the best known.\nOf Unsettled Tribes there were six classes with, in 1872, a total strength of 307,199 souls. Of these 172,328 were Bhils, 94,157 Kolis, 30,780 Dh\u00e1nk\u00e1s, 9660 N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s, 155 V\u00e1lvis, and 119 Chodhr\u00e1s.\n\nThe Bhils are found in large numbers, especially in the south-east of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha. The bulk of the population in R\u00e1jpipla, Sankheda, Mehv\u00e1s and Chhot\u00e1 Udepur, they become gradually fewer till, near the hills forming the watershed between the Narbada and Mahi, they give place to the Kolis. The Rewa K\u00e1ntha Bhil is generally of middle size, strong-limbed, muscular, and wonderfully active and dirty. Bhil houses, built neither in groups nor rows, are scattered some distance from each other, so that the village covers an area of three or four square miles. For this there are three chief reasons: the fear that their neighbour may be a witch and bring some calamity on them; their great dread of infection, which they believe to be the work of evil spirits, so that the favourite cure for a Bhil who has been long sick is to change his house; and lastly, there is the fear of fire, fires being kept burning in every hut both for heat and light. The Bhil hut is built of two forked uprights of kher wood, Acacia catechu, with a beam of teak laid across, upon which are fastened light teak rafters or bamboos. The rafters are fastened to the ridge pole by boring holes through their upper ends, and passing small male bamboos, generally through four rafters at a time, two of them going on one side of the roof and two on the other. If bamboo poles are used as rafters, they are chosen long enough to form both sides of the roof. From the underside of the centre of the bamboo a piece is cut, and this resting on the ridge-pole, the two ends of the bamboo fall on either side, shoots of creepers and strips of bark helped by the weight of the thatch keeping the rafters in their place. On the rafters some layers of teak leaves are laid, and over the teak leaves is a thatching of rough forest grass. The walls of the hut are made either of brushwood or of opened bamboos, plastered inside with mud and cowdung. To make these strips or bands of opened bamboos, across each point of a hollow or female bamboo pole, a number of up and down scars are cut. Then one large slit is carried from end to end, and the bamboo opened, and by the help of the joint cuts laid flat on the ground in one broad band. These bands are then interwoven and plastered inside with mud and cowdung. The hut has usually one opening protected by a wattled bamboo door. Outside the hut is generally a small covered stage for water pots and grass, high enough to let cattle stand below it. Of household goods, each hut has a short cot, a few jars for grain and cooking, earthen drinking vessels, and field tools, generally a wooden plough, a small pick, a hatchet, a bill-hook, and a few baskets.\n\nAs regards dress, the Bhil and Kolis of the p\u00e1l, are divided into two classes; potadi\u00e1s or waistcloth wearers, and langoti\u00e1s or\n\n---\n\n1 The Bhil is generally longer than his cot, according to his saying 'The cot should not swallow the body, but the body the cot.'\nloincloth wearers. The former, besides a waistcloth, wear a short coat, angarkha, and a turban, pagdi, generally white but sometimes red. A few, instead of the waistcloth, wear short drawers reaching to their knees. The latter have only a very narrow strip of cloth generally plain, but sometimes among the Rathv\u00e1s, Koli settlers from the M\u00e1lwa district of R\u00e1th and younger Bhils, with red borders, passed between the legs and fastened at either end to a string belt. A Bhil woman usually wears a coarse s\u00e1di, a large petticoat, gh\u00e1gro, and a cheap bodice. On holidays she puts on a silk s\u00e1di and a mashru petticoat, half silk and half cotton. On holidays men wear red or white turbans with peacock feathers in them, and round their shoulders pieces of white or red cloth, or among their headmen a piece of scarlet broad cloth. A Bhil\u2019s dress costs, as a rule, from 10s. to 12s. (Rs. 5-6) a year; a Bhil woman\u2019s from 14s. to 16s. (Rs. 7-8); and a child\u2019s from 6s. to 8s. (Rs. 3-4). Both men and women wear ornaments, chiefly of silver, brass, and glass. Men wear wristlets, rings, armlets, and necklaces, m\u00e1dali\u00e1s, all of silver. Women wear gold noserings, k\u00e1nto or v\u00e1l\u00ed; silver or brass earrings, dodis; necklaces, m\u00e1dali\u00e1s and h\u00e1nsdis of silver or brass and glass beads; armlets, chud\u00e1s, of brass, lac, or cocoanut shell, worn in tiers from the elbow to the wrist; wristlets, gujri, finger rings, and tiers of brass anklets, pinj\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, from the ankle to the knee. A man\u2019s ornaments are worth from 10s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 5-10) and a woman\u2019s from \u00a32 to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 20-25).\n\nThe ordinary food of a Bhil varies with the different seasons of the year. In the cold months (November to March) it consists of bread, rotla, made of the flour of Indian corn or other coarse grains, such as banti, Panicum spicatum, with occasionally split pulse, adad, Phaseolus mungo. Sometimes they eat khichdi, a mixture of coarse rice and boiled split pulse, adad, Phaseolus mungo, or mag, Phaseolus radiatus. In the hot season (April to June), when they are short of grain, they eat boiled mahuda berries, or mahuda berries mixed with a little Indian corn flour, soured with green or dry mangoes or dried jujube apples, and a buttermilk and Indian corn flour porridge. In the rainy season they live on wild fruits and roots, eked out with s\u00e1mo, a wild self-sown grain that comes up after the first few showers of rain. To these are added a few vegetables, chiefly onions and chillies, grown in plots near their huts. The Bhils occasionally add to their scanty supply of food by hunting and killing wild animals, and when these are scarce, by stealing and killing cattle. On holidays and festivals they are never without animal food. The Bhils are habitual topers and much given to mahuda spirits. The yearly food charges of a well-to-do Bhil family, a man, his wife, and two children, may be estimated to vary from \u00a37 12s. to \u00a38 16s. (Rs. 76-88).\n\nMost of the Bhils are peasants, but their scanty crops do not last them for more than three or four months. During the rest of the\n\n---\n\n1 The details are: grain, Rs. 36 to 48; molasses, Rs. 3; clarified butter, ghi, Rs. 6; oil, Rs. 1-8; salt, Rs. 6; liquor, Rs. 12; opium and tobacco, Rs. 12; and condiments, as. 4.\nyear they depend for support on the sale of forest produce, timber, mahuda, honey, wax, and lac.\n\nA Bhil is truthful, thrifty, superstitious, and fond of drink. His truthfulness is due rather to a want of readiness in telling lies than to any inborn or acquired love of truth; all are wanting in forethought. A thrifty Bhil is almost unknown. As a rule, they live from hand to mouth, deeply indebted to the village trader, and seldom receiving the full value of their labour or produce. Such is the Bhil\u2019s love of spirits that all their religious and social rites end in a great debauch. A rude still is made on the spot, a quantity of mahuda flowers is thrown in and the spirit drunk raw and fiery. At such times, both men and women mad with excitement, often commit serious crimes. Weapons are handy and a few taunting words provoke a discharge of arrows or a fatal blow with an axe. Afterwards they admit their fault, pleading drunkenness as an excuse. The Malivad Bhils, in the north of Lunavada, were at one time most lawless and unruly. They defied the authority of the Rajas of Lunavada and openly and fearlessly made raids into the neighbouring villages. Under British management they have been brought to order, and their leaders caught and punished. A trace of their former oppression remains in the bullock-driver\u2019s favourite curse, \u2018May the Malivads catch you.\u2019 Mr. Hall, who surveyed the district between 1867 and 1871, found the central or Bariya Bhils orderly, honest, well-disposed, willing, and cheerful. Of the south or Rajpipla Bhils, Lieutenant Pollexfen, who surveyed the district between 1852 and 1855, has left the following account.\u00b9 \u2018The Bhils are for the most part of middling stature, clean limbed and muscular, endowed with extraordinary activity and remarkably expert in the use of the axe on which their livelihood greatly depends. Mild and inoffensive, they are highly susceptible of kindness, and at the same time are wonderfully patient under oppression. Not even the smallest article was ever taken from my camp, though had they felt inclined, nothing could have been easier. I never heard of a theft or a murder. Their one fault seems to be drunkenness.\u2019\n\nA Bhil\u2019s religion consists largely of a belief in charms. They worship female deities, known as matas, represented by symbols rather than images, by wooden posts, earthen pots, toy horses, wicker baskets, and winnowing fans. They believe in witches and in the evil eye. They have their wise men called barvas, exorcists, whose office is hereditary, and who are in special request when an epidemic breaks out. Then the heads of the different village communities wait on the holy man with offerings, praying him to point out the cause of the visitation. The wise man generally names some old woman as the cause. Small mercy is shown her. She is seized by a raging crowd, swung by the heels or otherwise ill-treated, probably losing her life unless the police hear in time and put a stop to the riot.\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 320.\nOn their holidays and festivals, they dress in their gayest attire, and spend a little money in buying sweetmeats and other cheap luxuries. Their chief holidays are Holi, 15th Ph\u00e1gam Sud (February-March); Dasera, 10th A'so Sud (September-October); and Gokal \u00c1tham, 8th Shr\u00e1van Vad (July-August). The Holi holidays last for a week or more. During this time the Bhils do no work, drink liquor, dance, and sing obscene songs, and large bodies of them, men and women together, go round V\u00e1nia and other high caste houses asking for small money presents, goths. One favourite ceremony called the hearth, chulo, is to dig a wide trench, and filling it with logs of wood set it on fire. As it burns, the men get drunk, and run over the fire without burning the soles of their feet. Another of their frolics is to plant a small tree or branch firmly in the ground. Round this men and women gather, the women round the tree, the men outside. One man rushing in tries to uproot the tree, when all the women set on him and thrash him so soundly that he has to retire. Another man steps in, and he too is belaboured, and makes his escape. Thus the play goes on, till one man luckier or thicker skinned than the rest, bears off the tree, but seldom without a load of blows that cripples him for days. On Dasera day, 10th A'so Sud (September-October) they gather in large numbers in towns where their chiefs go in procession to worship the shami tree. On the Gokal \u00c1tham or 8th of Shr\u00e1van Vad, they attend fairs at the temples of some of their m\u00e1t\u00e1s or goddesses. Other yearly festivals are Naudarva, held in Shravan (July-August), and Jh\u00e1mpa held in K\u00e1rtik (October-November). At the first animal sacrifices are offered to Naudarva, apparently nava daro or new grass, and eaten by the villagers; liquor is drunk and the day spent as a holiday. The Jh\u00e1mpa, in October-November, is the harvest day, a more important festival. In both of these the whole village joins and each villager has to pay his share of the general cost. Goats and fowls are sacrificed to the god B\u00e1b\u00e1dev, offerings of liquor are poured out, the exorcist, barva, performs some mummeries, and the day ends with feasting and drinking. The village headmen, patels, take a leading part in these entertainments, and where the appointment is disputed, fights take place, sometimes ending in bloodshed.\n\nThe occasional festivals are the In and the J\u00e1tra or Y\u00e1tra. The in is the result of a vow taken by some of the villagers. A branch of the kalam tree is set in a hole, and the hole filled with rice instead of earth. The branch is then worshipped with animal sacrifices and liquor, the offerings being eaten by the whole body of villagers. The j\u00e1tra is also held on account of the fulfilment of a vow taken by some one of the villagers. On this occasion the god is worshipped with the usual accompaniments of animal sacrifices and liquor, and the people who come from all parts of the neighbourhood eat, drink, and make merry. No invitations are necessary to attend a j\u00e1tra. Any one hearing the sound of the village drum may join the party, sure of a welcome.\n\nOf festivals held at longer intervals than a year, the chief is B\u00e1ba dev, or the father god, held on the top of Devgad hill near the town of B\u00e1riya. The story of the festival is that when Dungarji,\nthe grandson of the Pat\u00e1i R\u00e1val, retired to B\u00e1riya after the Musalm\u00e1n conquest of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner in 1484, a Bhil was cutting wood on the top of the hill which overlooks the present town of B\u00e1riya. As he cut, he struck his axe against two small round stones and blood gushed out. The axe was shivered to pieces. The Bhil told the exiled prince, and he finding the stones, had a shrine built, and made the rule that once in twelve years the B\u00e1riya chief should visit them with great pomp. The shrine is on the top of a high hill called Devgad or the god\u2019s fort, approached by a very rough and winding path about a mile and a half long. The stones are worshipped under the name of Devgad B\u00e1ppi or the Devgad Father. They are set on a small raised verandah covered by a flat terrace and before them are numerous wood and clay horses, cocoanuts, oil, and other offerings. Near the shrine is a sacred brick and cement reservoir, kund, about twenty feet square and twenty-four deep, whose water is believed to purify from sin. The chief\u2019s twelfth yearly pilgrimage takes place in Ch\u00e1itra (March or April). On the 2nd of this month, every twelfth year, a Bhil exorcist, barra, goes to the shrine and there spends a month in devotion. During this time the holy man and his companions are supported at the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s expense, and are furnished with a guard. This office is hereditary in a particular Bhil family, who live in the village of R\u00e1i B\u00e1ra, about six miles from B\u00e1riya. On the appointed day, the 15th of Ch\u00e1itra, the R\u00e1ja and his retinue climb the hill on foot, and remain there for thirty-six hours. On arriving at the shrine rich offerings of animals, grain, and money are placed before the objects of worship and afterwards given to the officiating Bhils.\u00b9 When all is ready, the officiating Bhil begins to tremble and to personate the deity who is supposed to have become incarnate in him. Thus inspired he is believed to possess the power of prophecy; and not only the followers of the R\u00e1ja, but the R\u00e1ja himself approach him with deference and respect, and making known their wishes, humbly pray that they may be granted. Through his assistants the Bhil gives answers to the different applicants, generally laying down certain conditions, one of which almost always is the payment of a sum of money. Besides answering questions, the Bhil foretells whether the coming year will be one of plenty or of want, and whether the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s affairs will go well or ill. Lastly he blesses the R\u00e1ja, telling him that the deity is well disposed to him, and that his country will flourish. Then the chief gives a parting present, sarp\u00e1v,\u00b2 and the priest gives him and his followers, rice, flowers, and leaves of the bili tree. Separate ceremonies, much the same in detail, are performed in honour of the minor deity. The right to officiate belongs to a Bhil family, who live at the village of Udh\u00e1vla\n\n\u00b9 The details are: 4\u00bd cwts. (12 mans) of khichdi; 50 lbs (1\u00bd mans) of sukhi, or mal\u00e1di, bread made of flour, butter, sugar, and other ingredients. To these, according to some, are added 42 cwts. (12 mans) of boiled gram called b\u00e1tk\u00e1 and 4\u00bd cwts. (12 mans) of adad, made up into cakes called vadd\u00e1s; 12 male buffaloes; 12 goats; 12 fowls; 12 vessels of spirits; 12 vessels of oil; 1 small figure of a house partly of gold and partly of silver, the whole weighing 2\u00bd told\u00e1s; and 10s. (Rs. 5) in cash.\n\n\u00b2 The details are: one turban worth 10s. (Rs. 5); one shoulder cloth, shela, worth 10s. (Rs. 5); a waistcloth worth 2s. (Re. 1), and 10s. (Rs. 5) in cash.\nabout two miles from Bariya. Similar but less valuable presents are given. Before the ceremony is performed a raging tiger is believed to destroy the Bariya herds, and if the Raja makes no pilgrimage, some calamity will fall on his family or people. The last pilgrimage year fell in 1873 when the state was under British management. There was no tiger, no procession, and no punishment.\n\nThese aboriginal tribes hold no festivals in honour of the birth of a first child or of the first pregnancy of their wives; the only family events on which they spend money are marriages and funerals. Before a marriage or a funeral feast, to every family that is to be asked, a string is sent with a knot for each day till the feast. Each day the guest unties one knot, and, when all are untied, he comes to the entertainment.\n\nThe Bhils have some peculiar marriage customs. In some instances the match is made, as is usual with other tribes, by the parents of the bride and bridegroom. Sometimes the young couple arrange matters unknown to their parents. They disappear and after hiding for some days in the forest, come back and declare themselves man and wife. The parents as a rule accept the situation and after settling the bride's dowry which is generally from \u00a36 to \u00a38 (Rs. 60-80), the marriage is celebrated in the usual form. If the matter is not quietly settled, a feud runs on between the families until a bride is seized by force from the bridegroom's family or his cattle are carried off. Sometimes a woman boldly walks into the house of the man she wishes to marry, and declares that he is her husband. Should he be willing he sends for her father, and making him a present of from \u00a36 to \u00a38 (Rs. 60-80), the latter consents to the match. If the man is unwilling he is no way forced to make the woman his wife. Again, if a Bhil wishes to marry and is unable to pay his wedding expenses, he joins his future father-in-law as a serf, and contracts to serve him for a certain number of years, at the end of which he is entitled to the girl's hand and to have all marriage expenses paid. During this period of probation he and the girl live as man and wife. Polygamy is allowed among the Bhils and it is not necessary that the bride should be younger than the bridegroom: in some cases the wife is double and even treble the age of the husband. A Bhil woman cannot marry a second husband in the lifetime of the first, unless she obtains a divorce with his consent. Divorce is as a rule very easily granted. Women leave their husbands and take up with other men, and if the paramour is willing to pay \u00a36 to \u00a38 (Rs. 60-80), to make up for the husband's marriage expenses, nothing further is done. After the marriage ceremony is completed some women hide a ring and a few grains of Indian corn in a dunghill near the house, and tell the bride and the bridegroom to find them out. It is lucky for the bridegroom to be the first to lay his hand on the ring. After this the maternal uncle of the bride taking the married couple on his shoulders, dances along with the guests assembled for the occasion, singing songs to the accompaniment of a drum. The marriage\nfeast is boiled Indian corn and gram, some animal food and large quantities of mahuda liquor. Each guest, if a friend or relation of the host, brings with him a potful of liquor and a goat. The guests sing and dance all night, many of them drinking till they fall senseless.\n\nThe Bhils burn their dead. On their way to the burning ground, they make several halts picking up stones at each and heaping them in a pile near the burning ground. On the next day the stones are thrown away. On the tenth day, the R\u00e1valia, or Bhil priest, brings a brazen horse or a cow to the house of the deceased and places it on a piece of cloth. The people present sprinkle water on it and place before it a pie or a handful of Indian corn. The R\u00e1valia then sets the image in a brass dish filled with water, and placing the dish on his head dances and sings, the guests joining him. If the image in the dish moves they think the horse is possessed by the spirit of the dead and the people bow before it singing songs. Some rice and clarified butter are then given to the crows and next day the guests are feasted. As on marriage occasions, each of the host's friends and relatives brings with him a goat and a potful of liquor. After the feast is over they present turbans, p\u00e1gd\u00eds, to the eldest man in the deceased's family, and s\u00e1d\u00ed\u015b to the widow or other women of the house.\n\nOf the Bhils there are forty-two tribes or clans, gots, some of them claiming a strain of Rajput blood and bearing such names as Parm\u00e1r, V\u00e1ghela and R\u00e1thod.\u00b9 Intermarriage is allowed between the members of the different clans.\n\nThe head man of a Bhil village usually called jadvi possesses considerable influence among the villagers. He either enjoys rent-free land or is freed from the payment of other state dues. He also receives a small fee on marriages and money presents on Das\u00e9ra. He presides at the feasts and ceremonies held in honour of the village gods, devas.\n\nThe Kolis are divided into twenty-one tribes,\u00b2 gots, belonging to two great sub-divisions, Talabda and Kh\u00e1nt, which are so distinct that between them marriage is forbidden. The R\u00e1thva Kolis, originally settlers from R\u00e1th, a district in Ali Rajpur under the Bhop\u00e1var Agency in Central India, are found chiefly in the states of B\u00e1riya and Chhota Udepur. They live in the forests which they clear so quickly and well, that their axes are believed to have the virtue of never allowing a tree which they have once cut to grow again. They do not settle long in one place, moving from one tract to another, clearing them of wood and growing crops on them.\n\n\u00b9 The clans are: Parm\u00e1r; V\u00e1ghela; R\u00e1thod; Munia; B\u00e1bhar; Kat\u00e1ra; T\u00e1dvi; B\u00e1riya; B\u00e1man\u00eda; K\u00e1mbia; Pargi; Bily\u00e1l; Nim\u00e1ma; Bhuria; Makna; V\u00e1san\u00eda; D\u00e9mor; A'm\u00e1l\u00edar; K\u00e1tuja; Dung\u00ed; Kisori; Charpota; Kal\u00e1ra; Gan\u00e1va; Didor; Singh\u00e1da; Pal\u00e1s; M\u00e1n\u00ed; Buka; Machh\u00e1r; Hatila; Ad; T\u00e1bed; Mohania; Heval; B\u00e1haria; R\u00e1vat; R\u00e1val; M\u00e1l\u00edv\u00e1d; Garv\u00e1l; Makv\u00e1na; and V\u00e1h\u00e1ga.\n\n\u00b2 The tribes are: Pag\u00ed; B\u00e1riya; Dumar; Choh\u00e9n; Solanki; R\u00e1ja kiva; Kutar; D\u00e1man; Kat\u00e1ra; Patel; D\u00e1ora; Senv\u00e1i; G\u00e1mor; Dh\u00e1kania; Budel; Gad\u00e1l; Bhet\u00e1m; B\u00e1man\u00eda; T\u00e1m\u00e1s; Dabhol; and R\u00e1thva.\ntheir habits and way of living they are more like Bhils than Kolis. They wear no dress except a loin-band, langoti, and are very dirty. The Kolis' food, dress, and houses are of the same description as the Bhils', with only this difference, that the Talabda Kolis, who think themselves superior to other Kolis, do not eat beef or the flesh of any animals that have died a natural death. Most of the Kolis are peasants, but idle and unskilled far below the Kanbis. Nearly as thriftless as Bhils, they are deeply indebted to the village Vani\u00e1s, who, leaving them grain enough for food, seed, and rent, take the rest. They are more cleanly in their habits, and are not such simpletons as Bhils. Both classes are inveterate thieves; but the Kolis lay their plans with much more method, boldness, and cunning than the Bhils. They have better organizing powers and much more skill in concealing their actions. They lie in the most unblushing manner, and, when found out, they take their punishment with the greatest coolness and good temper. The Kolis are less superstitious and pay more respect to the Hindu religion than the Bhils. They worship all the Hindu gods, but chiefly Indra and H\u00e1tmal. They respect Br\u00e1hmans and employ them to conduct their religious ceremonies.\n\nPolygamy is allowed among the Kolis, but it is not necessary that the bride should be younger than the bridegroom. When a Koli wishes to get his son married, he generally, although the marriage may have been arranged long before, goes through the form of starting off to find a bride. On leaving his house, he must see a small bird, called Devi, on his right hand. Till he sees a Devi, he will not start, even though he is kept waiting for weeks or even months. After he has chosen a bride and made all the preliminary arrangements, he is asked to dine with her father. During the dinner, the women of the bride's family strew grains of corn on the threshold, and as the boy's father is leaving the house, they rush at him as if to beat him, and he, making for the door, slips on the grain and falls. This is all done intentionally that the boy's father may fall on the threshold of the girl's house, an omen so important that without it no marriage could prosper. When the marriage contract is settled, the bride's father sends half a pint (\u00bd ser) of oil to the bridegroom, and keeps the same quantity at his own house to be rubbed on the bodies of the couple, until the marriage is over. The bridegroom generally goes to the bride's village. On his approach, the patel with a lamp in one hand and the other on his mouth, comes out to receive the bridegroom and his party. Among Kolis, when a man dies leaving a widow, it is usual for his younger brother to marry her. But if she wishes to marry some one else, she can do so, if her future husband pays the younger brother the deceased husband's marriage expenses.\n\nThe Kolis burn their dead. On the 11th day after the burning, all the fellow-villagers of the deceased, together with his friends and relations, meet at some river or pond and have their mustachios shaved. They then take a stone, and pouring water on it believe that the soul of the deceased has entered the stone.\nThe Naikdas cling to the hills which separate Baria from Chhota Udepur, and are to be found almost exclusively in these two states. They are considered lower than the Kolis and Bhils. Their touch like the touch of Dheds and Bhangias is thought to defile. Of their origin two stories are told. One that their ancestors were grooms in the service of the Musalm\u00e1n nobles in the prosperous times of Champaran, who took to a plundering life when the city became deserted. The other account states that they are the descendants of the Nacks, attendants sent by the Raja of Raglan with his daughter on her marriage with one of the Rajas of Champaran. They eat the flesh of all animals, except the crow and the donkey. They show no respect to Brahmins. The common belief is, that they consider the killing of a Brahman an act of merit; as their proverb says that, by the death of one Tilvan, or man with a sect mark, tilu, a hundred are fed, referring to the feasts on the 11th, 12th, and 13th days after a Brahman's death. They worship Hanuman and female powers, mat\u00e1s. Formerly the Naikdas were celebrated freebooters, and even now 'May the Naikdas take you' is a common imprecation among bullock-drivers. In 1838 their raids became so formidable that it was found necessary to remove the superintendence of the Sagtala district in which they are chiefly settled, from the Raja of Baria and place it under the direct orders of the Political Agent. Strong measures were taken against them, and the disorders were suppressed. In 1868 they again gave some trouble, but the disturbance was soon quelled. Since then they have given up their predatory habits and begun to take to tillage. But they have still so bad a name that, on the restoration of the management of the Baria state to the present Raja, the Naikda district was kept under the charge of the Political Agent. The organization of the Naikdas is much better than that of the Kolis and Bhils. Each Naikda community has a chief with a minister, vajir. At the sound of their chief's drum the Naikdas gather from all sides and without a murmur obey his orders.\n\nThe Dhankas, a sub-division of Bhils, are found only in the Narbada basin. They and the Valvis and Chodhras have few points of difference from the other unsettled tribes.\n\nOf the whole Musalm\u00e1n population of 20,104 souls, 4155 were returned as settled in the state of Balasinor, 3088 in Lunavada, 808 in Kadana, 1038 in Sunth, 48 in Sanjesh, 1095 in Baria, 1515 in Chhota Udepur, 2066 in Sankheda Mehw\u00e1s, 5257 in Rajpipla, 1523 in Pandu Mehw\u00e1s, and 11 in the Political Agent's camp. In addition to the four main divisions, Syeds, Shaikhs, Moghals, and Pathans, numbering altogether 6325, or 31.47 per cent, of the total Musalm\u00e1n population, there were 1228, or 6.11 per cent of other Musalm\u00e1ns, not natives of India, consisting of 47 Afghans, 482 Arabs, 131 Baluchis, 544 Makranis, and 24 Others. The remaining portion of the Musalm\u00e1n population, 12,551 souls,\n\n---\n\n1 Full details of the Naikdas are given in the Panach Mahals Statistical Account. Bombay Gazetteer, III. 222.\nwere mostly descendants of converted Hindus, consisting of 1667 Bohoras, 21 Memans, 2 Khojas and 10,861 others. Most of the Pathans, Arabs, Baluchis, Makranis and Moghals are in the service of the different chiefs. The Arabs, besides fighting, guard their chiefs' treasuries and palaces; the others are employed only as soldiers. The Syeds, as the descendants of Hasan and Husain, the grandsons of Muhammad, hold the highest place among Musalmans. The Maliks and Shaikhs are mostly employed as messengers. The Ghanchis, generally called Bohora Ghanchis, are Sunnis by religion, and probably descendants of Hindu oil-pressers. The Pirzadas are the descendants of Dariyaishah, the celebrated saint, pir, of Virpur in Balasinor. Besides the above, there are Hajams, barbers; Kalals, liquor-sellers; Bhistis, water-carriers; Bhatiaras, professional cooks; Tais, weavers; Khatkis, tanners; Chitarias, painters; Dhuldoyas, gold-dust washers; Attars, perfume sellers; Madaris, strolling players; Fakirs, mendicants; Mirs, songsters; and Kasbans, prostitutes and dancing-girls.\n\nOf the total Parsi population of 198 souls, 147 were settled in the Rajpipla state, 17 in Baria, 17 in Chhota Udepur, and 17 in Sankheda Mehwas. They are chiefly engaged in liquor-selling and other trades.\n\nThe five Christians were all native converts.\n\nAccording to the 1872 census returns, there was in the Rewa Kantha one town or village to about every three square miles of land, each village containing an average of 145 inhabitants and about thirty-two houses. With the exception of the people of three towns, numbering 28,266 souls (Nandod with 9768 inhabitants, Lunavada with 9662, and Balasinor with 8836) or 5.59 per cent of the entire inhabitants, the population of the Rewa Kantha lived in 3481 villages, with an average of 137 souls to each village. Of the whole number of villages 2862 had less than 200 inhabitants; 477 had from 200 to 500; ninety-nine had from 500 to 1000; thirty-four from 1000 to 2000; eight from 2000 to 3000; and one from 3000 to 5000.\n\nAs regards the number of houses there was in 1872 a total of 113,210 or on an average 26.65 houses to the square mile. Of the total number 18,014 houses lodging 75,930 persons or 15.02 per cent of the entire population, at the rate of 4.22 souls to each house, were buildings with walls of fire-baked bricks and roofs of tile. The remaining 95,196 houses accommodating 429,717 persons or 84.98 per cent with an average house population of 4.51 souls, included all buildings covered with thatch or leaves or whose outer walls were of mud or sun-dried brick.\n\nRewa Kantha villages may be divided into two classes; the better villages with houses close to one another, and the hamlets of the aboriginal tribes whose huts are scattered over a large extent\n\n---\n\n1 The word Bohora is here, as it pretty often is, used to mean Hindu converts from the non-armbearing classes.\nof ground. In Bhil and Koli villages there is no staff except the patel or tadvi who is both the revenue and police head of the village. Either the whole or part of his land is rent-free. In the better class of villages, besides the headman, there are watchmen, rakhas or payis, chiefly Kolis or Bhils whose duty it is to guard the villages. They are sometimes paid in grain by the villagers and sometimes enjoy rent-free lands. In a few villages are havaldars, who look after the fields, see that no cattle trespass on them, and help the commandant, thandar, and accountants, talatis. Each thandar has under him one or more talatis who live with him and not in the villages under their charge. They sometimes go to their villages on duty and return to the taluka town. The talatis are paid by the state in cash. In some villages there are kotwals, chiefly Bhils or Kolis who do miscellaneous work. Their place is sometimes supplied by Bhangias or Dheds who are either paid in grain by the villagers or enjoy rent-free land. Tracking is done by rakhas and pagis. The rakhas are bound to pay compensation for thefts committed in villages under their charge, the amount being settled by a village committee or by the thandar or police officer. The village artisans known as settlers, vascavayas, are chiefly potters, barbers, and tanners; carpenters, blacksmiths, tailors, and shoemakers are found only in large villages. They are generally paid in gram by the villagers, and by strangers or others in cash. The Chamadias supply leather to cultivators for buckets, being paid in cash; and sometimes when a cultivator gives up his buffalo's carcase to a Chamadia, he is entitled to receive from him leather in exchange. Except in Bhil villages where Ravaliyas act as priests and are on special occasions fed and presented with grain, there are seldom any village priests, gors. In a few villages shops are kept by Vaniyas and Bohoras, who sell what is required by the villagers and buy whatever local produce they can get cheap. These shop-keepers have houses in other places where they go when trade is dull.\n\nRewa Kantha Vaniyas seldom go to distant towns to trade. A few Lunavada Bohoras have shops in Bassein, Mahim, Bombay, and Poona, where they stop part of the year selling glassbeads, bracelets, and other petty wares. Ahmedabad, Kaira, and Kathiawar merchants come to Lunavada and Balasinor to buy grain, butter, oil, and leather. Godhra Bohoras and Anklesvar Parsis come for mahuda flowers, mahuda berries, oil doliu, and timber. A few Anklesvar Parsis have opened liquor shops in some Rajpipla villages and live there part of the year. The Godhra Bohoras have shops in the states of Baria and Chhota Udepur. A few Vaniyas of the Sankheda Mehvas and of the Gaikwar's territory trade to Chhota Udepur. Some merchants of Ahmedabad, Kapadvanj, and Baroda come here for Bombay hemp, san. A few Ahmedabad Vaniyas come to Lunavada town every year to sell bits of kinkhab and silks for women's bodices. Some Visnagara Nagar Brahmins of Lunavada go during the rainy season to Malwa where they recite Purans or Veds. A few go to Kathiawar and obtain money by reciting the Veds. Some Audich and Mevada Brahmins of Lunavada go to Baroda and serve as cooks or water\ncarriers. A few Modh Br\u00e1hmans of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor go out on begging tours. Of artisans, barbers go to Baroda where there is a great demand for them. Carpenters seldom go out of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha limits, while bricklayers find employment at times in a few of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls towns. V\u00e1gad stone-masons are sometimes employed in Sunth and Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da as they are thought more skilful than the local bricklayers. M\u00e1rv\u00e1di blacksmiths who move from village to village pick up odd jobs. Some M\u00e1rv\u00e1di immigrants have settled in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha where they work as day-labourers. The Ahmedabad V\u00e1ghris occasionally come here and either beg or in the rainy season sow vegetables and sell them. The Bhils are migratory, often changing their place of abode. They sometimes go to other districts during the mahuda season to gather the flowers and berries. Kanbis and other better class cultivators seldom move into the Rewa K\u00e1ntha, but Bhils from the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, and R\u00e1thv\u00e1s from M\u00e1lwa sometimes settle in the wild parts of the district.\n\nChapter III.\nPopulation.\nMovements of the people.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nWithin the Rewa K\u00e1ntha limits are great varieties of soil. In the north near the Mahi and in the south near the Narbada are rich tracts of alluvial land. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and B\u00e1lasinor in the north, light brown, gor\u00e1du, though not so rich as that of central Gujar\u00e1t, is the prevailing soil. There are also a few tracts of grey, besar, land, generally growing rice. Near the river Shedhi are some patches of land called bhejv\u00e1li, very damp and yielding a cold weather crop of wheat and pulse, but not well suited for cotton. In Sunth, the black, k\u00e1li, soil holds moisture well and without watering yields two crops a year. The B\u00e1riya lands, light brown, gor\u00e1du; deep black, k\u00e1li; and sandy, ret\u00e1l, are considered as good as any in Gujar\u00e1t and capable of yielding any crop, except tobacco. The black loam of the Sankheda and P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s is nearly as rich as the cotton lands of \u00c1mod and Jambusar in Broach. R\u00e1jpipla, especially its Narbada districts, is exceedingly fertile. In the hilly parts the soil varies much, but in the open districts it is black throughout. Except a few tracts of rocky and inferior black soil, the Rewa K\u00e1ntha is on the whole fertile.\n\nIn the open country, with Kanbis and other high class husbandmen, the tillage is the same as in central Gujar\u00e1t. In the hilly and woody tracts inhabited by Bhils, Kolis, and other unsettled tribes, cultivation is of the rudest kind. Most families have a few fields and near every hut is a plot of ground called v\u00e1da or k\u00e1chha, sown with Indian corn or some other food grain. Manure is used only for the plots near the houses, and is hardly enough even for them. In B\u00e1riya and R\u00e1jpipla, the want is to some extent supplied by burning dry sticks and leaves on the ground, shortly before the rains (June). This system of wood-ash manuring is called vah\u00e1lra in B\u00e1riya, and d\u00e1dhia in R\u00e1jpipla. Among the Bhils, there is almost no irrigation. The river banks are too steep to allow of their water being used, and the people have neither the means nor the wish to build wells. In ordinary years the black loamy soil keeps moist enough to yield a cold weather crop and the want of water is not felt. Their field tools are a small wooden plough, the coulter and share formed of a bar of iron about three-quarters of an inch square, its lower end pointed and slightly bent towards the front. Besides the plough, they use a small pick, a hatchet, and a bill-hook. The plough is used only by the better class of Bhils in lowland clearings. Drawn by weak, ill-fed, oxen, it does little more than scratch the surface of the ground. When the land is too rough for the plough,\nit is tilled with hoes and pickaxes; their rude carts are of wood without a bit of iron, occasionally with wheels formed of solid blocks of timber. The axle tree is generally of dh\u00e1man, Grevia asiatica, a very tough white and plentiful wood.\n\nThe Rewa K\u00e1ntha Crops are, of Cereals: maize, mak\u00e1i, Zea mays; rice, d\u00e1g\u00e1r, Oryza sativa; Indian millet, juv\u00e1r, Sorghum vulgare; millet, b\u00e1jri, Pennicillaria spicata; barley, jav, Hordeum hexastichon; wheat, ghau, Triticum aestivum; r\u00e1jgaro, Amaranthus paniculatus; kodra, Paspalum scrobiculatum; banti, Panicum spicatum; b\u00e1vto, Panicum frumentaceum; k\u00e1ng, Panicum italicum; chino, Panicum miliaceum. The wheat grown in the district is of two kinds, v\u00e1jia and k\u00e1tha. The rice is of a coarse description called vari. Of kodra a kind called minia kodra has a narcotic property, which is to a certain extent neutralised by washing and drying two or three times before grinding. Of Pulses: tuver, Cajanus indicus; math, Phaseolus aconitifolius; mag, Phaseolus radiatus; adad, Phaseolus mungo; v\u00e1l, Dolichos lablab; gram, chana, Cicer arietinum; peas, vat\u00e1na, Pisum sativum; and guv\u00e1r, Cyamopsis psoraloides. Of Oil seeds; castor oil seed, divela, Ricinus communis; gingelly oil seed, tal, Sesamum indicum; and rape seed, sarsav, Brassica napus. Of Fibres, cotton, kap\u00e1s, Gossypium herbaceum; and Bombay hemp, san, Crotalaria juncea. Of miscellaneous crops, sugarcane, serdi, Saccharum officinarum; and tobacco, tamb\u00e1ku, Nicotiana tabacum. Of Vegetables: potato, bat\u00e1ta or atokda, Solanum tuberosum; sweet-potato, sakaria, Convolvulus batatas; onions, k\u00e1nda, Allium cepa; garlic, lasan, Alium sativum; yam, rat\u00e1lu, Dioscorea alata, and shingada, Trapa bispinosa. The other vegetables are, eggplant, vegan, vanti\u00e1k or ringana, Solanum melongena acute; angled cucumber, turia, Luffa acutangula; g\u00e1lku, Luffa petandria; k\u00e1rela, Momordica charantia; common cucumber, k\u00e1kdi, Cucumis sativus; the long white gourd, dudhi bhopla, Cucurbita longa; and red pumpkin, kohlu, Cucurbita melopepo. The root of the dudhi bhopla is said to be alterative and the seed and juice of the bitter g\u00e1lku are violently emetic and cathartic. When given in infusion they are a bitter tonic and a powerful diuretic. The leaves of the bitter variety of the red pumpkin are said to be useful in cases of jaundice. Chik\u00e1n, a wild species of k\u00e1kdi, is very cold and indigestible. Of Spices and Condiments there are, turmeric, haldi, Curcuma longa; chilly, marchi, Capsicum annum; ginger, \u00e1du, Zingiber officinale; coriander, dh\u00e1na, Coriandrum sativum; and cumin seed, j\u00edru, Cuminum cyminum. Of Fruits, melon, shakarteti, khadbuch\u00e1, or gota, Cucumis melo; water melon, tadbuch, Cucurbita citrallus; guava, j\u00e1mr\u00fakh or j\u00e1mph\u00e1l, Psidium guava; custard apple, sit\u00e1ph\u00e1l, Annona squamosa; and plantain, kela, Musa paradisiaca. The fruit of the wild plantain is too stunted and full of large seeds to be eaten.\n\nKolis, Bhils, and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s form the bulk of the agricultural classes. These are very indifferent husbandmen and are in poor circumstances. The higher class cultivators are Kanbis, K\u00e1chhi\u00e1s, M\u00e1lis, Pateliy\u00e1s, and Rajputs.\nA hilly well watered land, its rough tribes accustomed to live on fruits, roots, and wild vegetables, Rewa K\u00e1ntha, though it has passed through years of great distress, has never been entirely wasted by famine. The first famine of which the memory remains was in 1746-47. Hardly any rain fell, and the crops did not ripen. Many people died, but the wild inhabitants kept themselves and their cattle alive by eating forest roots and locusts which abounded at the time. The next year of scarcity 1790-91, caused by the failure of rain, appears to have been the nearest approach to a general famine on record. Poor people sold their children. The Bhils lived on wild roots and berries. Many lives were lost and much cattle perished, and the country was infested with bands of marauders. The chiefs doled out daily food to the destitute, but no public works were undertaken. Another failure of rain caused scarcity in 1802, but the distress was not so great nor the failure of crops so general. In the famine of 1812-13 the distress was almost as severe as in 1790-91. Millet was sold at eight pounds the rupee, and rice at six pounds, and as in 1790, from the state stores doles of grain were distributed. Twelve years later the season of 1825 was one of scarcity, but of no widespread suffering. In 1833-34 matters were worse. The rainfall was scanty and the small harvest was destroyed by swarms of locusts. Still there was grain in the country, and the people helped by their chiefs passed through the time of scarcity without much loss of life or of cattle. The British Government remitted \u00a35295 4s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 52,952-5-3) from the tribute. Since 1834 there has been no famine. On account of scanty rainfall, \u00a32790 6s. 9d. (Rs. 27,903-6-0) of tribute were remitted in 1839, and \u00a3426 18s. (Rs. 4269) in 1849. In 1864 scanty crops and the very high value of cotton raised millet to twenty-two pounds the rupee, and caused much distress among the poorer classes. During the last two years (1877-78), the great exports of grain to the Deccan and Southern Mar\u00e1tha districts, and poor local harvests have once more brought back prices to famine pitch, millet selling in 1878 at fifteen, and rice at ten pounds the rupee.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCAPITAL.\n\nThe chief money-lenders are V\u00e1ni\u00e1s and Br\u00e1hmans. Of bankers there are only a few in such large towns as N\u00e1ndod, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor. In smaller towns some bankers deal in grain and other articles. Others have shops in villages, living there part of the year, and making bargains with the people, advancing them money and seed. In the Rewa K\u00e1ntha every Bhil or Koli has his own V\u00e1n\u00ed or other money-lender who has more power over him than even his chief. So much is this the case that sometimes a village is spoken of as so and so\u2019s village not because he is its owner but because its people are his debtors. In bad years the money-lender sometimes helps his debtors with new loans of money or seed grain. If he refuses, the Bhils apply to some one else and the first creditor would then have little chance of recovering his money. Debts are handed down from father to son, many of the poorer classes passing their whole life, sunk in debt. Harvest over, the money-lender with one or two friends starts on a collecting tour. And while in his village the debtor, however poor, has to pay his share of the money-lender\u2019s expenses. With much wrangling, in which the ignorant Bhil is always worsted, the accounts are balanced, the debt running on while the original amount lent continues to increase. Money or grain is taken in part payment of debts, and however scanty his debtor\u2019s stock of grain, as much as can be seized is carried off. Except when his payments stop for two or three years, and he finds that his debtor has begun to raise money from some one else, the creditor seldom takes his debtor into a civil court. If he does, as a rule, he makes little by it, as the whole of his debtor\u2019s property is seldom enough to satisfy the decree.\n\nWhen a lender is put in possession of a house or a plot of land, as a rule, no interest is charged. When a gold or silver ornament is pledged, the yearly interest varies from three to six per cent, and on personal security the well-to-do borrow at from six to twelve per cent. In the case of Bhils, Kol\u00eds, and others of the lower classes, at div\u00e1li in October the beginning of the new year, a quarter of the amount due is added to the principal, and if the whole is not paid during the year, at the beginning of the next, a quarter of the enhanced principal is again added. This system is known as sav\u00e1i or one and a quarter. For seed grain one-quarter or one-half as much again as the original and sometimes even double the sum originally lent, is recovered either in cash or in grain. Except alienated or part alienated holdings, from the large area of waste arable land and the uncertainty of tenure the right of occupancy has no sale or mortgage.\nvalue. Mortgaged alienated land may be redeemed at any time. Bhils and Kolis have no ornaments of value. Among them buffaloes or bullocks are the only movable property ever pledged. When cattle are pawned they generally remain with the borrower. Their huts would not be taken in mortgage. They are of no money value, and the timber and building site belong to the chief. Except when they have cattle to pledge, the poorer classes borrow either on their own or their friends' personal security. Their indebtedness is a by-word and their want of common care or thrift leaves them in their creditors' hands. A large number of money-lenders live on their debtors and a few grow rich. But the Bhils, when too hard pressed, are ready to leave the district, and the interest actually recovered is said to be not more than from six to twelve percent on the sum advanced.\n\nThe district has few craftsmen. In the rural parts the Kolis, Bhils, and other poor tribes supply their own wants, making tools, carts, and huts, and in the towns the want of well-to-do customers, and the heavy labour and money taxes keep down the number of craftsmen. In some states when the chief wants work done, artisans are brought and forced to work without pay. In other states, when working for the chief, the better class of artisans, carpenters, bricklayers, and tailors are paid half their market wages, and potters and other lower workers get a day's supply of grain. In badly managed states this labour tax does not stop with the chief, but is levied by all state servants and relations. That these demands may be spread over the whole caste, the headman arranges that the members of the caste should work for the chief in turn. There are no trade guilds including the members of several castes. But among craftsmen of the same caste certain rules about work and wages are laid down and anyone breaking them runs the risk of being thrown out of caste. If a caste-fellow dies, on the 11th, 12th, and 13th day after his death, and on caste-feast days, carpenters and bricklayers are not allowed to work. They may not take less than the regular wages, and in Lunavada town, are forbidden under fine from taking work on contract. In these two castes the headmen arrange that the members should in turn work for any one unable to work for himself. No barber is allowed to shave any one but the people of his own village. In the large towns the craftsmen show no lack of skill, and when well paid and given good materials, do as good work as in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nCarpenters are paid daily at rates varying from 9d.-2s. (6 as. - Re. 1). When the lower rates are paid, they are generally given food in addition to their money wage. Their women do not help in their work. But when grown up their sons add to the family earnings. Bricklayers are paid less than carpenters, generally from 9d.-1s. 6d. (6 - 12 as.) a day. Stone masons earn good wages 1s. 6d. (12 as.) a day with, when they come from Meywar, their food besides. A skilled goldsmith makes\n\n---\n\n1 A carpenter's wage in Lunavada is now (1879) 1s. 7\u00bdd. (13 annas).\nfrom \u00a330 to \u00a350 (Rs. 300 - 500) a year, and one less skilled who makes brass and tin ornaments for Bhil women about \u00a310 (Rs. 100). A skilled worker earns more, but an ordinary blacksmith's daily wage varies from 6\u00bdd. - 9\u00bdd. (as. 4-3 to 6-4). A tailor's earnings range from 6\u00bdd. - 9\u00bdd. (as. 4-3 to 6-4) a day. If specially skilled they may rise to 1s. (8 as.). An ordinary barber makes from 16s. - \u00a31 (Rs. 8-10) a month. A specially good man may earn as much as \u00a31 4s. or \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 12 or 15). A cotton cleaner, pinj\u00e1ra, makes from 12s. - 16s. (Rs. 6 - 8) a month, and a shoemaker from 16s. - \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 8 - 15). The monthly wage of a dyer is from \u00a31 - \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 10 - 12), and of a weaver from 16s. - \u00a31 (Rs. 8 - 10). Among these craftsmen those who work at home such as furniture-makers, turners, goldsmiths and blacksmiths, are helped by their women in parts of their work that need no skill. Tailors' and goldsmiths' wives do some ordinary work and add to the family earnings. The clerks, gum\u00e1st\u00e1s, of bankers and well-to-do traders are paid from \u00a35 - \u00a325 (Rs. 50 - 250) a year. A day-labourer's wage is for a man from 3d. - 6d. (2 - 4 as.) ; for a woman from 2\u00bdd. - 3d. (1\u00bd - 2 as.) ; and for boys and girls from \u00bdd. - 2\u00bdd. (2 pice - 1\u00bd as.) Almost all wages, both of craftsmen and day-labourers, are paid either in cash or in grain, or in both.\n\nThe current coins are silver rupees and copper pice. No rupees are coined in the district. The Baroda or siyasi rupee passes all over the Rewa K\u00e1ntha and the Broach rupee in the R\u00e1jpipla state. The Imperial rupee is used only to a small extent. Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Sunth, and Chhota Udepur have their own copper coinage passing only within their own limits. In B\u00e1r\u00edya the old or Godhari copper pice, and in R\u00e1jpipla Cambay pice, are current. The value of the pice is subject to great changes, the Baroda rupee representing at different times from seventy to ninety pice. When a half pice is to be paid the pice is cut or broken into two pieces, and one does duty as a half pice. The Imperial copper coins are current in all states, a Baroda rupee changing for fifty-six and a Broach rupee for about sixty-three Imperial pice.\n\nIn former times, the absence of a local town population and the want of good secure roads, made grain prices lower in Rewa K\u00e1ntha than in any other part of Gujar\u00e1t. But of late years the opening of the railway line to P\u00e1l\u00ed, the making of good roads and the establishment of a better police have raised Rewa K\u00e1ntha grain prices to the level of other parts of the province. A statement of produce prices reaching as far back as 1834 is given below. Up to 1871 the figures refer only to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. Since then they are supposed to represent the average prices over the whole district. Excluding the years of scarcity the whole may be divided into three periods. 1834 was a year of scarcity. 1835 to 1842 was a time of moderate rates, the price of bajri, the staple grain, varying from twenty in 1838 a year of\n\n---\n\n1 In the Sunth town of R\u00e1mpur, Indian corn was once lower than 160 lbs.

Chafing under his loss of profit, a grain merchant struck a heap of corn with his shoe, and for this insult to Annadev, the god of food, was fined by the Sunth chief.\nscanty rainfall, to seventy-eight and a half in 1841, and averaging fifty-one pounds. This was followed by eighteen years of cheap grain, prices varying from fifty-eight and a half in 1846 to 101 in 1850, and averaging eighty pounds. The next sixteen years was a period of high prices varying from twenty-two in 1864 the American war time, known as the *dhadinu dh\u00e1n* or the ten *ser* year, to fifty-one in 1874 and averaging thirty-eight pounds. Lastly in 1877, from the famine in the Deccan and Madras, millet prices rose from fifty to thirty pounds, and in 1878 a local failure of crops forced them up to fifteen pounds.\n\n### Rewa K\u00e1ntha Produce Prices, 1834-1878.\n\n| Produce          | Scarcity | First Period (1835-1842) | Second Period (1843-1860) |\n|------------------|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                  |          | 1834 | 1835 | 1836 | 1837 | 1838 | 1839 | 1840 | 1841 | 1842 | 1843 | 1844 | 1845 | 1846 | 1847 |\n| Indian millet, *b\u00e1jri* | 27     | 42   | 58   | 50   | 20   | 51   | 60   | 73\u00bd | 97\u00bd | 90   | 85   | 81   | 58\u00bd | 72\u00bd |\n| Indian corn      | 33     | 49   | 68   | 75   | 59   | 57   | 101  | 91\u00bd | 119\u00bd | 110  | 110  | 68   | 78   | 78   |\n| Rice             | 26\u00bd    | 60   | 80   | 100  | 85   | 74\u00bd | 59   | 52   | 59   | 70   | 80   | 77\u00bd | 77\u00bd | 87\u00bd |\n| Wheat            | 26     | 26   | 65   | 62   | 60   | 62   | 36\u00bd | 33   | 38   | 82   | 87\u00bd | 57   | 30   | 80   |\n| Gram             | 32     | 46   | 75   | 104  | 102\u00bd | 51   | 55\u00bd | 66   | 85   | 35   | 136  | 100  | 80   | 74   |\n| Pulse, *tuver*   |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\n| Produce          | Second Period\u2014continued |\n|------------------|-------------------------|\n|                  | 1848 | 1849 | 1850 | 1851 | 1852 | 1853 | 1854 | 1855 | 1856 | 1857 | 1858 | 1859 | 1860 |\n| Indian millet, *b\u00e1jri* | 98\u00bd  | 99   | 101  | 87   | 90   | 85   | 88\u00bd | 80   | 71\u00bd | 71   | 82\u00bd | 70   | 80   |\n| Indian corn      | 142\u00bd | 133\u00bd | 129  | 130  | 110  | 112\u00bd | 108\u00bd | 100  | 67\u00bd | 114  | 97\u00bd | 105  | 64   |\n| Rice             | 85    | 60   | 35   | 80   | 75   | 97\u00bd | 105  | 95   | 80   | 90   | 115\u00bd | 82   | 60   |\n| Wheat            | 62    | 44   | 51   | 57   | 56   | 75   | 50   | 74   | 55   | 65   | 66   | 68\u00bd | 38   |\n| Gram             | 86    | 72\u00bd | 97   | 93   | 93   | 111\u00bd | 98   | 110  | 91   | 120  | 103  | 100  | 80   |\n| Pulse, *tuver*   |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\n| Produce          | Third Period (1861-1878) |\n|------------------|--------------------------|\n|                  | 1861 | 1862 | 1863 | 1864 | 1865 | 1866 | 1867 | 1868 | 1869 |\n| Indian millet, *b\u00e1jri* | 47\u00bd  | 48\u00bd | 45\u00bd | 22   | 23   | 44   | 36   | 39   | 32\u00bd |\n| Indian corn      | 41    | 62   | 41   | 39   | 23   | 60   | 82   | 63\u00bd | 33   |\n| Rice             | 50    | 45   | 39   | 39   | 27   | 28   | 22   | 43   | 30   |\n| Wheat            | 20    | 30   | 27   | 17   | 17\u00bd | 28   | 24   | 30\u00bd | 18\u00bd |\n| Gram             | 43    | 40   | 42   | 26\u00bd | 26   | 23   | 39   | 45   | 33   |\n| Pulse, *tuver*   |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\n| Produce          | Third Period (1861-1876)\u2014continued |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                  | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 | 1873 | 1874 | 1875 | 1876 | 1877 | 1878 |\n| Indian millet, *b\u00e1jri* | 31   | 26   | 39   | 40   | 51   | 48   | 50   | 30   | 15   |\n| Indian corn      | 36\u00bd  | 45   | 49   | 59   | 56\u00bd | 61   | 63   | 31   | 16   |\n| Rice             | 22    | 40   | 22   | 28\u00bd | 31   | 30   | 29   | 21   | 10   |\n| Wheat            | 22    | 28   |       |       |       |       |       |       |      |\n| Gram             | 37\u00bd  | 42   | 45   | 49   | 49   | 60   | 64   | 50   | 17   |\n| Pulse, *tuver*   |        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\nThe weights and measures current in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha are the same as those in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t. The *tola* is equal to the weight of a Baroda rupee minus two *ratis*, and of an Imperial rupee minus 1\u00bd *v\u00e1ls*. The *ser* is equal to forty Imperial rupees. Grain and *mahuda* are weighed in *mans*, and *manis* of twelve *mans*\neach. A hundred manis make one man\u00e1sa and 100 man\u00e1s\u00e1s make a kan\u00e1s\u00f3. In Baroda, mahuda is weighed by the kalsi equal to sixteen mans. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da a mudo of cement, chho, weighs fifty mans. A carpenter's and cloth vendor's yard, gaj, is twenty-four inches, and a tailor's twenty-six. Cloth is measured by the h\u00e1th, rather variable, but on the whole corresponding with the cubit. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, where the survey system has been introduced, land is measured by acres and fortieths, gunth\u00e1s, and in R\u00e1jpipla, the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, and a part of P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s, by kumbh\u00e1s of nearly an acre, and in the remaining states by bigh\u00e1s of about half an acre. The bigha seems to be of recent origin. In old title deeds land is marked either by its boundaries or by the amount of a certain seed that might be sown in it. The Rewa K\u00e1ntha kumbha is said to be the same as the Broach measure, but in practice it would seem to be somewhat larger. The weights in ordinary use are pieces of iron or stone. In the states under British management, these weights are from time to time tested by the police, when anything wanting is made up by adding a piece of iron.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTRADE.\n\nThe Rewa K\u00e1ntha trade and the Panch Mah\u00e1ls trade are in many points alike. Both have a through traffic between Gujar\u00e1t and Central India, and a local trade west with Gujar\u00e1t and east with Rajput\u00e1na, Central India, and Kh\u00e1ndesh. And in both districts, while the opening of railways through Gujar\u00e1t has increased the local trade westwards, the through trade has dwindled, the old straight routes with their rough roads and heavy dues failing to compete with the safe railway journey by Bombay and Kh\u00e1ndesh to Indor.\n\nFormerly Rewa K\u00e1ntha trade westwards set towards the coast, most of it centering in the ports of Jambusar and Broach. It is now diverted to the line of the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway, the western limit of all the roads leading from the Rewa K\u00e1ntha to Gujar\u00e1t. Besides the main line of railway running north and south, two feeders, in the north one from \u00c1nand to P\u00e1li, and in the south one from Karjan to Ch\u00e1nod, pass east towards the Rewa K\u00e1ntha. The Rewa K\u00e1ntha roads end westwards in P\u00e1li, Baroda, Dabhoi, Ch\u00e1nod, Anklesvar, and P\u00e1noli, and eastwards in Dungarpur, Jh\u00e1lod, Dohad, Ali R\u00e1jpur, Indor, and Kukarmunda. Though most of them are fit for carts, these roads, except the main line from Godhra to Dohad, are country tracks neither metalled nor bridged. They may be brought under four groups, centering at P\u00e1li, Baroda, Dabhoi, and Anklesvar.\n\nAt P\u00e1li seven roads meet: a Dungarpur road running south through P\u00e1ndarv\u00e1da, Virpur, Vardh\u00e1ri, and B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor; 2, a Dungarpur road running south-west through Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Vardh\u00e1ri, and B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor; 3, a Jh\u00e1lod road running south-west through R\u00e1mpur, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor; 4, a Jh\u00e1lod road running south through Sanjeli and Shera; 5, a Jh\u00e1lod road running further south through Randhikpur and Godhra; 6, the great high road from Dohad west through Piplod and Godhra; and 7, a second Dohad road through B\u00e1riya and Godhra.\n\nFour lines center at Baroda: 1, several small tracts from the Melv\u00e1s estates northward along the Mahi; 2, the Dohad road leading south-west through B\u00e1riya and K\u00e1lol; 3, the J\u00e1bua road passing from Central India west through Kakurkhila, S\u00e1gt\u00e1la, R\u00e1jgad, and K\u00e1njari; and 4, the Chhot\u00e1 Udepur road west through Jetpur, J\u00e1bug\u00e1m.\n\n---\n\n1 A third branch line is now being made from Dabhoi to Badharpur in Baroda territory.\n2 A new road has lately (1879) been made from Jh\u00e1lod through Dudhia under B\u00e1riya, running into the main Godhra-Dohad road.\nand V\u00e1goria. Three roads center at Dabhoi; 1, the Chhota Udepur road southwest through Jetpur, J\u00e1bug\u00e1m, and Sankheda; 2, the P\u00e1nvad road west through V\u00e1sna and Sankheda; and 3, a second P\u00e1nvad road passing through Kar\u00e1li and Sankheda. Five roads center at Anklesvar; 1, the Ali R\u00e1jpur road southwest through Chhota Udepur, Kar\u00e1li, V\u00e1sna, Nasv\u00e1di, Tilakv\u00e1da, and N\u00e1ndod; 2, a P\u00e1nvad road joining the Ali R\u00e1jpur road at Kar\u00e1li; 3, a P\u00e1nvad road joining the Ali R\u00e1jpur road at V\u00e1sna; 4, the Kav\u00e1nt road running west through Nasv\u00e1di, Alva, Virpur, and N\u00e1ndod, and from N\u00e1ndod passing southwest through \u00c1vidha, Jagadia, and Gov\u00e1li; and 5, a road from Kukarmunda on the T\u00e1phi, west through P\u00e1t, Bad\u00e1dev, Pat\u00e1v, and Dharoli. Only one road reaches P\u00e1noli from Kukarmunda through Bad\u00e1dev and Luna.\n\nBesides these a road fit for carts runs 114 miles north and south from Kad\u00e1na on the Mahi to within a few miles of the Narbada at H\u00e1mp. This road passes through Sunth eight miles, R\u00e1mpur four miles, Sanjeli twelve miles, Randhikpur eight miles, Piplod twelve miles, B\u00e1r\u00edya eight miles, S\u00e1gt\u00e1l\u00e1 eleven miles, Chhota Udepur twenty-five miles, P\u00e1nvad eight miles, Kav\u00e1nt eight miles, and Karapani ten miles. From Karapani ten miles on to the Narbada it is fit only for horses or bullocks. This and other roads crossing the main stream of traffics are, except as feeders, of small commercial value.\n\nThe following details show the present traffic along the chief lines of road. Of the P\u00e1li roads the most northerly enters the Rewa K\u00e1ntha at the village of Detv\u00e1s in Kad\u00e1na territory. Beyond Detv\u00e1s there is hardly any cart traffic. Almost every thing is carried on pack bullocks, the Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s bringing grain and opium to Gujar\u00e1t and taking back salt, tobacco, and cloth. At Detv\u00e1s the road divides, one branch turning to the west by Virpur, the other keeping more directly south to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. From Detv\u00e1s the west branch passes through Pandarv\u00e1da ten miles, and Virpur sixteen miles. Each of these places is a local trade center, Pandarv\u00e1da for the surrounding Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da district, and Virpur for the sub-division, pargana, of that name under B\u00e1lasinor. From these two places the district produce, grain, mahuda oil, clarified butter, and timber, is sent to Gujar\u00e1t, and tobacco, spices, iron, copper, salt, and cloth are brought back. From Virpur the road runs south twelve miles to Vardh\u00e1ri, where it is joined by the south branch. This south branch leaving Detv\u00e1s passes through Kh\u00e1npur twelve miles, crosses the Bh\u00e1dar river to Madhv\u00e1s eight miles, crosses the Mahi to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da seven miles, to Champeli six miles, and crosses the Mahi again to Vardh\u00e1ri eight miles, or a total distance of forty-one miles. Of the two branches the west or Virpur, shorter, free from a double passage of the Mahi, and in every way better, is used by the through Gujar\u00e1t trade. The town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da (9662 souls) draws considerable local traffic along the south route. The third of the P\u00e1li roads, coming from Jh\u00e1lod, enters the Sunth state at a village called Kundla four miles west of Jh\u00e1lod. Until very lately this road passed through the state to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da by Parthampur eleven miles, \u00c1njanva twelve miles, and B\u00e1cla seven miles, to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da six miles, a total distance of 36 miles. After leaving\nParthampur it enters some difficult passes, where until lately travellers ran so great a chance of being robbed and ill treated, that very little traffic passed along it. Since the death of the Sunth chief (1872) a new road has been opened through R\u00e1mpur five miles, from Parthampur to Sunth two miles, thence to Sarsav six miles, to Thamba seven miles, and to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da seven miles. Though a little longer this road is safer and has the advantage of passing through R\u00e1mpur, a local trade center of some consequence. From R\u00e1mpur through Sunth to the plain country beyond, this road in four miles passes through no less than four ranges of hills. But crossing them by the help of gaps it is nowhere very steep, and is well guarded by police posts. Before 1872, bands of travellers used in fear and trembling to make their painful way on foot or horseback over a mountain path, now the post passes regularly and single carts can travel without an escort. The next important line of communication is the fourth of the P\u00e1li lines, the south Jh\u00e1lod road by Sanjeli and Shera. This, much used by traders, passes through about eleven miles of Sanjeli territory. The fifth P\u00e1li line, the Jh\u00e1lod and Randhikpur road, passing through some rather rough country, carries much the same trade as the Jh\u00e1lod and Shera line. The sixth P\u00e1li line, the great high road from Dohad to Godhra, passing through twenty miles of B\u00e1riya territory is the only first class road in the whole of Rewa K\u00e1ntha. It is bridged and metalled, and has a steadily growing traffic. Formerly travellers ran great risk of being robbed, now by clearing forests and placing police posts, all danger has been removed. Of its cross country feeders the chief are from Dudhia and Bandib\u00e1r on the north, and B\u00e1riya on the south. A road now being made from Ash\u00e1di on the high road to B\u00e1riya will keep the B\u00e1riya traffic open throughout the year. Another road between Dohad and Godhra passing through B\u00e1riya, D\u00e1m\u00e1v\u00e1v, and Simalia, is very rough, winding through several hill passes. Since the opening of the great high road, this route is, except for local B\u00e1riya traffic, little used.\n\nOf the roads that end in Baroda, those from the Mehv\u00e1s estates on the Mahi, passing chiefly through G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory are common country tracks. The B\u00e1riya and Baroda road leaves B\u00e1riya by the east gate and after a mile and a half crosses the P\u00e1nam river; thence it goes through a moderately flat and wooded country eight miles to D\u00e1m\u00e1v\u00e1v, and thence passing through Simalia three miles, where there is a police station and wood mart, and crossing the river Goma it passes into K\u00e1lol about thirteen miles from B\u00e1riya. The Jalena and Baroda road enters B\u00e1riya territory at Kakarkhila. Then passing over the two rough Khalta and Kans\u00e1ra ridges, it crosses the Valva river and passing two villages belonging to Ratanm\u00e1l which are embedded in B\u00e1riya territory, it reaches the P\u00e1nam river about twelve miles from the frontier. Up to this point the road is very rugged and before 1875 was not fit for carts. Since 1875 the passes have been put in order and carts can travel. After crossing the P\u00e1nam the road leads through a wooded country almost due west to S\u00e1gt\u00e1la twelve miles. Here in the heart of the N\u00e1ikda country is a post, th\u00e1na, and from it a road leads north to B\u00e1riya eleven miles. This\nroad has lately been cleared of brushwood and by day or night can be safely used. From S\u00e1gt\u00e1la the western route passes without difficulty sixteen miles west over high ground to R\u00e1jgad, the headquarters of another sub-division. From R\u00e1jgad there are three routes to Baroda, one through K\u00e1lol, another through Kanjeri two miles from H\u00e1lol, and the third through Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. The second is the straightest and most used. The distance from R\u00e1jgad to the frontier of the B\u00e1r\u00edya state by any of these routes is not more than five or six miles.\n\nThe remaining roads, that running east and west center in Dabhoi and Anklesvar, all lie to the south of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad and the chain of hills which forms the water-shed between the Mahi and Narbada basins. The first in order is that from M\u00e1lwa to Gujar\u00e1t along the Or valley. This road comes from Ali R\u00e1jpur and enters Chhota Udepur at the village of Kharakv\u00e1da. Winding through the hills it reaches to Or about ten miles from the frontier, and after crossing it runs close along its right bank to Chhota Udepur seven miles further on, thence still skirting the right bank of the river it passes through Jejgad eight miles, Jetpur five miles, to J\u00e1bug\u00e1m seven miles, crossing the frontier three miles further on into G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory. Thence there are two routes, one direct to Baroda through V\u00e1ghoria; the other to Dabhoi through M\u00e1khni, Sankheda, and B\u00e1dharpur. The former of these, not more than 250 miles long, is the shortest and most direct route from Indor to Baroda. If the chiefs through whose lands it passes were to improve the present rough track, save travellers from robbery, and lower their transit dues, this might be made a most important line of communication. At present it has not one-tenth of the traffic it might have. Indor and Baroda merchants prefer to send their goods from one place to the other by rail through Bombay rather than trust them to the rough usage and exorbitant demands on the direct route. Within Rewa K\u00e1ntha limits the line presents no difficulties. The country is level, the soil light and sandy, and the rivers few and easily bridged. But for through traffic, unless some change can be made all along the line, it is of little use to improve the Rewa K\u00e1ntha section alone.\n\nThe next line is the part of the Mhow and Dabhoi road that passes through Chhota Udepur. This road enters Rewa K\u00e1ntha three miles east of P\u00e1nvad. West of this village the road divides, one branch passes north through Kar\u00e1li fifteen miles, and thence towards Sankheda seven miles, to the frontier. The other branch passes west along the Heran valley and by V\u00e1sna a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r village, eighteen miles from P\u00e1nvad. Of these the north branch is less hilly and rugged, but neither of them is much used. Almost all the traffic finds its way through the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, and crossing the Narbada reaches the Baroda railway at Anklesvar. Of these branches one from Chhota Udepur through Kar\u00e1li sixteen miles, and the other from P\u00e1nvad meet at V\u00e1sna and continue in one line as far as Nasv\u00e1di, seven miles. Here they are joined by a lower road which passes through Kav\u00e1nt. This line enters Udepur territory about eight miles to the east of Kav\u00e1nt, and thence through\nPal\u00e1\u015bni sixteen miles to Nasv\u00e1di six miles. From Nasv\u00e1di the united road passes south through S\u00e1vli six miles, to Alva three miles, Uchhad three miles, and Virpur three miles, where it crosses the Narbada. Another route of about the same length crosses the Narbada two miles lower at Tilakv\u00e1da.\n\nAs the Narbada cannot be forded at either crossing the traffic through the Udepur state and Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s is almost entirely on pack bullocks. After crossing the Narbada, the united road passes eight miles through country much broken by ravines to N\u00e1ndod, the capital of R\u00e1jpipla. A mile west of N\u00e1ndod it crosses the Karjan river at a ford, and thence passes through Part\u00e1pnagar eight miles, Haripura eight miles, Avidha five miles, Jagadia five miles, and Gov\u00e1li four miles to the frontier of the R\u00e1jpipla state three miles further on and about four miles from Anklesvar station. Between the Karjan and the frontier this road crosses many small streams and is used only during the fair weather. Lately (1875) the R\u00e1ja of R\u00e1jpipla has had surveys and estimates prepared for a bridged road along this route. This when finished will be a great boon to the people of the district.\n\nThe next important line is that from Kh\u00e1ndesh to Guj\u00e1rat through R\u00e1jpipla. This road after leaving Kukarmunda on the T\u00e1pti and passing through eighteen miles of Kh\u00e1ndesh enters R\u00e1jpipla a little to the south of S\u00e1g\u00e1b\u00e1ra, and through P\u00e1t five miles, and Kupi six miles, divides at Bad\u00e1dev, eight miles further on. From B\u00e1d\u00e1dev the upper road follows the course of the Karjan river for five miles to Vadv\u00e1dra; then turning west it passes through Motra ten miles, and Pat\u00e1r ten miles to Dharol four miles, and reaches the western frontier of the state eight miles further on, and about the same distance from Anklesvar. The lower road after crossing the Karjan at B\u00e1d\u00e1dev winds through the hills to Kh\u00e1mb, nine miles, thence passing a range about 600 feet high it crosses the Tokri river, sixteen miles, and at Luna, three miles, crosses the Kim. Six miles further it reaches the west boundary of the state about seven miles from P\u00e1noli on the Baroda railway. Both these routes were once lines of great traffic, but are now very neglected. They are mere cart tracks passing through dense forest and hills, badly provided with water, and with no village accommodation for travellers. From the carelessness of the R\u00e1jpipla chiefs almost all through trade has left them.\n\nThis completes the description of the chief lines of road between Rajput\u00e1na, M\u00e1lwa, and Guj\u00e1rat. The increase of its local traffic shows how keenly traders feel the advantage of a thoroughly well made road like that from Godhra to Dohad. But east of Dohad the Central India chiefs do nothing to improve their roads and their heavy transit dues are, especially since the opening of the Indor railway, driving trade from the direct route round by rail through Bombay.\n\nThe small streams and water-courses need no ferries. During the rains no carts can move, and foot and horse travellers can always easily ford the streams. At other times all traffic passes without hindrance. During the rains and the first months of the cold weather the Mahi and Narbada cannot be forded. The chief\nplaces where they can be crossed during the hot months have been mentioned under the head 'Rivers.' The Narbada can be passed without much difficulty. But its banks are so steep and its bed so heavy with sand and shingle, that to pass the Mahi is always a work of great labour. Across the Narbada, when it cannot be forded, at Ch\u00e1nod, V\u00e1dia, and Tilakv\u00e1da, goods and passengers are carried in small well built ferry boats. On the Mahi at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Kad\u00e1na small uncouth canoes hollowed out of simla wood and generally tied two together take the place of ferry boats. The right of plying these canoes is every year farmed by the state to the highest bidder. At Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da when the P\u00e1nam is in flood, under charge of ferrymen of the Bhoi caste, travellers put their clothes in three or four empty narrow-necked earthen jars, gold\u00e1s, tied together by the necks. These the fishermen force mouth-down under the water, and the traveller either sitting on them or leaning over them, as in swimming, is with the help of the Bhois ferried across.\n\nThere are six post offices, four at B\u00e1lasinor, B\u00e1riya, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and R\u00e1mpur maintained by the British Government, and two at Ohhota Udepur and N\u00e1ndod by the Udepur and R\u00e1jpipla chiefs.\n\nThe Rewa K\u00e1ntha with its scanty unsettled population has little trade and few manufactures. Trade comes under two heads, home trade and outside trade. The home trade is carried on by V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s and a few Bohor\u00e1s and P\u00e1rsi shopkeepers. These petty traders, advancing money or seed to the peasants, are paid in grain at harvest time. This they either sell in the district, or send to other Gujar\u00e1t market towns. Well-to-do husbandmen sell the produce of their fields to the local grain dealers or send it where they find the best market. The outside trade is carried on by the better class of husbandmen and by strangers, some of them from the Panch Mah\u00e1l\u00e1s and Kaira, and others from Broach and Surat. These men especially in October, Div\u00e1li, at the early harvest time come in numbers into the hilly districts and barter with the Bhils taking their spare stores of rice and pulse and giving cloth, tobacco, molasses, salt, salt-fish, and spices. Many P\u00e1rsis chiefly from Anklesvar have settled among the R\u00e1jpipla Bhils, getting in exchange for liquor and rent advances, large quantities of grain and clarified butter. Another branch of the outside trade is in the hands of Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s and Ch\u00e1rans. The Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s whose head-quarters are in M\u00e1lwa, Kh\u00e1ndesh, and Meyw\u00e1r bring droves of pack bullocks into Gujar\u00e1t laden with grain and go back with loads of salt. On their way they do a little business with the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Bhils. The Ch\u00e1rans in smaller numbers come from K\u00e1thi\u00e1war and follow the same track as the Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s. They also carry on a small trade with the Bhils giving them bullocks and buffaloes and getting the price either paid down in cash or in grain in the next year.\n\nThe chief Rewa K\u00e1ntha exports are of field produce, grain of all kinds, cotton, oil seeds including castor oil, diveli, sesamum or\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 316, 317.\ngingelly, tal, and rape, sarsav, safflower, tobacco; of forest produce, mahuda flower and fruit, timber, firewood, bamboos, and catechu, k\u00e1tha; of animal produce, clarified butter, honey, bees' wax, lac, wool, and hides; and of manufactured articles, grind-stones, stone-platters, and soap.\n\nGrain, chiefly millet, Indian corn, pulse, and oil seed, goes in large quantities from all Rewa K\u00e1nth\u0101 states to the nearest railway station, or to any Gujar\u00e1t market where prices are favourable. Cotton is grown chiefly in the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s on the north-west and in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s and in some parts of R\u00e1jpipla in the south. R\u00e1jpipla cotton of an average value of about \u00a330,000 (Rs. 3,00,000) is brought to Anklesvar, cleaned in steam European ginning factories, and sent to Bombay. Cotton from the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s worth in ordinary years about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) is sent chiefly to Dabhoi, ginned there and forwarded by rail to Bombay. The P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s cotton is also sent to Bombay chiefly from the Baroda and P\u00e1li stations. Clarified butter and oil seeds go in large quantities to the neighbouring market towns of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nThe most important Rewa K\u00e1nth\u0101 exports are forest produce, timber, firewood, bamboos, and mahuda flowers. As regards timber cutting, except the old charge an export fee on every cart-load of timber, the rules vary greatly in the different states. In B\u00e1lasinor and the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s in the north-east, and in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s in the south, timber is so scarce that only a very little is exported. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, only husbandmen are allowed to fell timber free of charge for their houses, carts, and field tools. Others have to pay for the timber cut. In Sunth any one may fell timber but only for local consumption. From these places little timber is exported. On the other hand in B\u00e1r\u00edya, Chhota Udepur, and R\u00e1jpipla, except that outsiders have to pay a fee, there is scarcely any restriction on the felling of timber. The hills to the north-east of R\u00e1jpipla, though they suffer from yearly burnings, have some fine timber. But it is most difficult to get at, and, except a little floated down the Narbada to Ch\u00e1nod and Sinor, none is exported. The work of cutting timber and floating it down the Narbada is followed by a special class of Bhils known as Kab\u00e1dis\u00b9 or timber carriers. Teak is chiefly found in the south-east of R\u00e1jpipla, in S\u00e1g\u00e1b\u00e1ra the teak, s\u00e1g, land, and in Nans\u00e1r, Panchmoli, and Ganva. It is cut about Holi time (April), after the forests have been fired, and during the rains is floated down the T\u00e1pti. Without its wood trade the people of B\u00e1r\u00edya would be very badly off. From very old times the husbandmen have been allowed to cut, and on the payment of a small fee to export, timber. So dependent are they on the wood trade that they are seldom able to pay the duty till on their way back after selling the timber. The chief sorts of wood exported are teak, kher, sadar, and biya, all used in house building and bought in large quantities in Baroda, Godhra, P\u00e1li, and other Gujar\u00e1t markets.\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 279 and 305, The word Kab\u00e1dis comes from kab\u00e1d, timber.\nMahuda trees grow in great numbers in Bariya and Chhota Ud\u00e9par. In Bariya alone there are believed to be from 20,000 to 25,000 trees. The Bhils and Kolis of those parts set so high a value on mahuda trees that they are often the cause of bloody feuds. Most of them careless husbandmen and sunk in debt, their little store of grain is soon either wasted or made over to a creditor. They pay their rents from timber and live almost entirely on the proceeds of the mahuda flowers, which they gather at the end of the cold season (March) and sell to the nearest Vania or Bohora. A Bhil woman looks on the mahuda flower as her parent from whose kindness alone she can buy a petticoat, or a bit of cloth for a bodice. When mahuda flowers are scarce, or when the price is low, the Bhils are in a very bad plight, finding the greatest difficulty in keeping body and soul together.\n\nOf minor forest produce honey is found in the wild parts of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha. There are two chief sorts, a better called rice honey, d\u00e2ngariu, made at the time of the rice harvest (November), white, very sweet, and about as thick as frozen butter, and a poorer sort called kesudiu or kh\u00e1khr\u00fb, Butea frondosa, honey made in spring (April) when that tree is in flower. The honey is gathered by Bhils and Naikd\u00e1s, bought from them by Vanias and Bohoras, and sent to different parts of Gujar\u00e1t, where especially the d\u00e2ngariu fetches high prices.\n\nGum, lac, and other minor forest products are largely exported by petty traders, who pay the state a small yearly sum for the right of opening shops in the Bhil, Koli, and Naikda villages. Gum, chiefly from the b\u00e1val, Acacia arabica, kher, Acacia catechu, and dh\u00e1vda, Anogeissus latifolia trees, is gathered by Bhils and Kolis and sold to Vanias who export it. At Lunavada b\u00e1vali gum is sold at 3d. a pound (Rs. 5 a man); kheri at 6d. a pound (Rs. 10 a man); and dh\u00e1vda at 1\u00bdd. a pound (Rs. 3 a man). The gum, supposed to be strengthening, is largely used, especially by women at the time of childbirth. The dh\u00e1vda gum is also used in dyeing cloth. The export of lac was in the seventeenth century a very large trade, and is still of some importance. The chief lac-yielding trees are kh\u00e1khr\u00fb, Butea frondosa, and pipla, Ficus religiosa. The lac is gathered by\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 153.\n2 The following details give some idea of the value of the Bariya mahuda crop. In 1873-74, at the rate of 1\u00bdd. on forty pounds (1 anna a man) the export mahuda duty yielded \u00a3365 10s. 6d. (Rs. 3655.4.0). This implies a total of (1,38,484 mans) or at the rate 1s. for forty pounds, the local price in that year, a total revenue of \u00a36924 4s. (Rs. 69,242). During the last five years the price of mahuda in Bariya has varied from 2\u00bd to 8s. (Rs. 20 - 4), and averaged 18s. (Rs. 9). Mahuda is exported from the other Rewa K\u00e1ntha states also, but in smaller quantities.\n3 Sankheda (1638) produced every year 25,000 pounds of lac. Mandelslo in Harris, II. 113. Of the abundance of sealing wax made at Ahmedabad in 1660 the greatest part came from Sindhi Kera (Sankheda). It drops first out of several sorts of trees not unlike the thorn and plumb tree. When the wax is raw it is dark-brown, then it is beaten and melted with red, green, or black, and put on sticks and sent to Europe to seal letters. They varnish many ships with it as also tables, cabinets, and other articles.' Ogilby's Atlas, V. 214; Sankheda (1666) sent great quantity of lac to Baroda. Thevenot, V. 94.\nthe unsettled tribes and sold to the Bohora and V\u00e2nia merchants at from thirteen to fourteen pounds the rupee, who export what is left after home consumption. Before exportation, the lac is heated and purified and mixed with various colouring substances. Of the whole supply a little is locally worked up into bracelets. It is also used by turners for lackering wood and by goldsmiths for filling up hollow ornaments.\n\nThe chief imports, both for the local and the through trade are Europe and country piece goods, metals wrought and unwrought, grain of all sorts, salt, tobacco, sugar, molasses, opium, cattle, groceries, and sundries. The import trade is generally in the hands of village dealers, and Vanj\u00e2ras and Ch\u00e2rans. In the mahuda and grain seasons, and on market days, hat, the wild tribes buy large quantities of cloth in exchange for mahuda, grain, gum, lac, honey, bees\u2019-wax, and other forest produce.\u00b9\n\nDetailed trade returns for 1878 give, for the leading Rewa K\u00e1ntha states, a total value of \u00a3331,969 (Rs. 83,19,690). Of this \u00a3310,793 (Rs. 31,07,930) was the value of the exports; \u00a3166,881 (Rs. 16,68,810) of the imports; and \u00a3955,484 (Rs. 35,54,840) of the goods in transit.\u00b2\n\nTo the total amount of exports R\u00e1jpipla contributed \u00a3188,016, Lun\u00e1v\u00e2da \u00a318,355, Bariya \u00a332,866, Chhota Udepur \u00a321,120, B\u00e1las\u00eenor \u00a318,355, and Sunth \u00a313,950. To the total amount of imports B\u00e1las\u00eenor contributed \u00a345,647, R\u00e1jpipla \u00a340,511, Lun\u00e1v\u00e2da \u00a337,368, Bariya \u00a320,596, Sunth \u00a314,764, and Chhota Udepur \u00a39185. To the total transit trade Bariya contributed \u00a3283,183, B\u00e1las\u00eenor \u00a336,528, Chhota Udepur \u00a333,489, Lun\u00e1v\u00e2da \u00a321,300, Sunth \u00a313,320, and R\u00e1jpipla \u00a310,670. Among exports the chief were cotton \u00a3139,149, timber \u00a353,731, mahuda \u00a327,257, grain \u00a323,442, oil and oil-seeds \u00a314,224, opium \u00a312,784, and clarified butter \u00a312,527.

Though much care has been taken from the extreme difficulty of getting correct trade returns, these values should not be considered more than rough estimates.\nThe following return shews for Bariya the approximate values of the imports, exports, and goods in transit during the seven years ending 1876:\n\n**Bariya Trade, 1870-1876.**\n\n| Articles          | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 | 1873 | 1874 | 1875 | 1876 |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Cattle            |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Clot              |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Groceries         |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Opium             |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Salt              |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Tobacco           |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Sundries          |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Grain             |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Clarified butter  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Mahada            |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Oil and Oil-seeds |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Opium             |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Salt              |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Tobacco           |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Sundries          |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\nTotal: 372,211 329,612 295,367 277,694 155,494 218,323 273,508\nFor Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth the following statement gives such trade figures as are available for the nine years ending 1878:\n\n**Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth Trade, 1870-1878.**\n\n| Year | Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da | Sunth |\n|------|----------|-------|\n|      | Import   | Export| Transit| Import | Export| Transit|\n| 1870 | \u00a389,055  | \u00a350,462| \u00a388,960| \u00a3...   | \u00a3...  | \u00a3...   |\n| 1871 | \u00a371,154  | \u00a368,178| \u00a374,602| \u00a3...   | \u00a3...  | \u00a3...   |\n| 1872 | \u00a345,992  | \u00a337,835| \u00a387,379| \u00a3...   | \u00a3...  | \u00a3...   |\n| 1873 | \u00a341,405  | \u00a338,028| \u00a325,647| \u00a3850   | \u00a325,896| \u00a311,659|\n| 1874 | \u00a330,860  | \u00a336,680| \u00a324,480| \u00a314,430| \u00a315,120| \u00a311,978|\n| 1875 | \u00a351,060  | \u00a334,598| \u00a317,455| \u00a318,619| \u00a328,010| \u00a314,426|\n| 1876 | \u00a345,427  | \u00a347,888| \u00a326,490| \u00a311,450| \u00a322,547| \u00a314,985|\n| 1877 | \u00a340,485  | \u00a335,751| \u00a325,691| \u00a311,413| \u00a326,273| \u00a316,525|\n| 1878 | \u00a337,168  | \u00a338,190| \u00a321,300| \u00a314,764| \u00a313,949| \u00a312,320|\n\nTransit Duties.\n\nA comparison of the available customs and transit revenue details gives the following results. In R\u00e1jpipla, between 1776 and 1785 they varied from \u00a31300 to \u00a34000 (Rs. 13,000 - 40,000), from 1794 to 1819 they averaged about \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), in 1821 they fell to \u00a3695 (Rs. 6950), and in 1827 to \u00a3770 (Rs. 7700). In 1878 they had again risen to \u00a35560 (Rs. 55,600). In B\u00e1riya the duties amounted in 1818 to \u00a31400 (Rs. 14,000); in 1825 to \u00a31797 (Rs. 17,970); in 1865 to \u00a35133 (Rs. 51,330); and in 1878 to \u00a37433 (Rs. 74,330). From July 1878, B\u00e1riya reduced its transit duties on the Godhra-Dohad road, and, instead of levying rates proportioned to the value of the merchandise, takes, as an experiment, a moderate toll on the carts passing through its portion of the high road. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da the duties amounted in 1870 to \u00a32637 (Rs. 26,370); in 1874 to \u00a32281 (Rs. 22,810); in 1877 to \u00a32481 (Rs. 24,810); and in 1878 to \u00a31352 (Rs. 13,520). In Sunth the duties amounted in 1872 to \u00a3853 (Rs. 8530); and in 1878 to \u00a3785 (Rs. 7850).\n\nThe present duties are a great hindrance to trade, and, since the opening of railways through Gujar\u00e1t and to Indor, have had the effect of driving the through trade from the roads to the railway. At present the states cannot well afford to give up so large an item of their revenue. But as tillage spreads and the land revenue grows, it will be more easy to free trade from the burden of transit duties.\n\nManufactures.\n\nThe Rewa K\u00e1ntha manufactures are of little importance. In the Ratanpur sub-division of R\u00e1jpipla iron of excellent quality used to be smelted. But probably from the fall in the price of iron and the rise in the price of fuel, this industry has for some years ceased. From the R\u00e1jpipla village of Ratanpur or the gem village, considerable quantities of carnelians are sent to Cambay.\u00b9 To those given in the Cambay Statistical Account, the following local details\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 318.\nof the manufacture of Cambay stones may be added. Carnelians were formerly burnt only in the village of Limodra in the Jagadia sub-division of Rajpipla, when the business was monopolized by a few Musalm\u00e1n families. Lately two other establishments have been opened, one under a Rajput at the village of Sult\u00e1npur, the other at R\u00e1n\u00edpur under a Kanbi. The miners are Bhils. The season lasts from October, Ashvin, to May, Vaish\u00e1kh. The miners, besides food, tools, and a little oil to burn in the pit are paid 2s. (Re. 1) for six baskets full, each on an average holding twenty-five pounds, sers, of stones. After the mining season is over, the stones are gathered at the villages of Ratanpur, Sult\u00e1npur, and R\u00e1n\u00edpur, and as described in the Cambay account, are baked with fire. During the rains (June - October) work is at a standstill, and the last year's pits are broken in by the rain, and new pits dug at the opening of the next season. Of the value of the outturn of the carnelian mines nothing certain is known. According to the Limodra dealers, they are paid from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a35 a man of forty pounds, and in a year sell from \u00a3800 to \u00a32000 (Rs. 8000 - 20,000) worth of stones. Of the three colours, red, white, and yellow, red is the most valuable. During the last century, the carnelian revenue after falling, in 1810, to \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500), and in 1825 rising to about \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000), had in 1876 gone back to about \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000), the amount they yielded one hundred years ago.\n\nDuring February and the three following months the making of catechu, k\u00e1tho, from the bark of the kher, Mimosa catechu, tree employs many B\u00e1riya and Rajpipla Kolis and Na\u00edkd\u00e1s. The process though rude is simple and cheap. Kher branches are cut, stripped of bark, and chopped into three or four inch pieces. These put into earthen pots full of water are boiled, and the water passing off in steam leaves a thick sticky decoction. A pit is dug five or six feet deep and narrow enough to be covered by a small bamboo basket. The thick substance is placed in the basket, and as it strains, the water sinks into the ground, the valuable part stays in the pit and the refuse is left in the basket. The extract is then taken out, placed on leaves in the sun, and when dry is sold at B\u00e1riya at from 3s. to 5s. (Rs. 1\u00bd - 2\u00bd) a man. From B\u00e1riya it is sent to M\u00e1lwa and Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nSoap like that made at Kapadvanj is manufactured in the towns of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and B\u00e1lasinor. To make it, salt earth, us, is mixed with lime and water, and poured into the top of a row of cement cisterns built one above the other. Each cistern has a hole in the bottom and the water, charged with the soda and lime, soaks through and is collected at the foot. Mahuda oil, doliu, is thrown into an iron cauldron and heated. Into this the soda and lime water is poured, and after standing some time is allowed to flow out. This process is repeated daily for seven days when the oil becomes\n\n---\n\n1 The details are: from 1776 to 1785, Rs. 3000; from 1784 to 1803, Rs. 2000; from 1804 to 1810, Rs. 1800; from 1810 to 1819, Rs. 1500. In 1821-22, Rs. 3500, in 1825-26, Rs. 5204, in 1826-27, Rs. 5001, in 1827-28, Rs. 4001. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXXIII, 269.\nlike thick butter. This paste is then placed in wooden troughs mixed with hot soda and lime water, softened by a wooden ladle and laid on a cement floor to dry. When it has hardened, it is rolled into balls, stamped with a seal and sold for about four pence the pound (3 piec \u00a3 ser). This soap, sold in all Bohoras' shops, is much used for washing clothes. In 1876, soap worth about \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000) was exported half from Lunavada and half from Balasinor.\n\nCoarse doti cloth and tape for cots are still rather important manufactures, and the Bhils make good bamboo baskets and matting. Other Rewa Kantha industries have of late years declined. Since its iron furnaces stopped, the swords for which Nandod was once famous are no longer made. Machine-woven cloth has to a large extent taken the place of the old hand-woven varieties, and, unable to hold their own against European competition, the Nandod weavers have ceased to work their fine-cloth looms.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nOf the early \u00c1ryan conquest and settlement of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha a few traces remain in its old name of Hidimba Van or the forest of Hidimba, a giantess, who according to the story married Bhim of Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t fame (1400 B.C.?). Of this wedding the memory still survives in the north of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, where of several old ruined buildings, one is still known as the marriage hall, chori, and a large stone lying near it as the mortar where the opium was prepared for the marriage feast. In another part of the district one of the hills of B\u00e1lasinor is sacred to Bhim and his giant wife.\n\nSoon after the beginning of the Christian era R\u00e1jpipla must already have been a place of some consequence as Ptolemy (150) knew of its Sardonyx hill, where the sardonyx stone is found. About two hundred years later, Godhrabaka or the Cow\u2019s Lake, the modern Godhra in the Panch Mah\u00e1l\u00e1s, seems from the evidence of a metal-plate inscription, to have been the head-quarters of a chief dependent on the Valabh\u00ed sovereigns. With the rise of the Anhilv\u00e1da kings (746), a new power was introduced into eastern Gujar\u00e1t, and Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner became, and till the fall of Anhilv\u00e1da (1304), continued the most important place in this part of the province.\n\nUnder the first Anhilv\u00e1da dynasty (746 - 942), except Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, almost all the Rewa K\u00e1ntha lands were under the government of B\u00e1riy\u00e1s, that is Koli and Bhil chiefs. In the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, driven south and east by the pressure of Musalm\u00e1n invasions, chiefs of Rajput or part Rajput blood took the place of the old Koli and Bhil leaders. The first established of these Rajput houses was that of the R\u00e1ja of R\u00e1jpipla. As early as the middle of the eleventh century (1064) Limodra, the head-quarters of the agate trade, was the seat of a Rajput chief. This R\u00e1ja, if descended from Chokh\u00e1r\u00e1na the son of the R\u00e1ja of Ujain who first established himself in the village of Pipla, must have belonged to\n\n---\n\n1 Bertius\u2019 Ptolemy, 199, 203. Ptolemy places the Sardonyx hill next to the Vindhyan range. But its position in his map and the remark in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (66 - 160) that the Broach onyx stones came from Paithan in Ahmednagar (McCrindle\u2019s Periplus, 127) would seem to place the chief carnelian mines in the Deccan or Central Provinces rather than in R\u00e1jpipla.\n\n2 Ind. Ant. LXIII. 16.\n\n3 The chief\u2019s name was Prithip\u00e1l. The inscription is on the footstool of the image of Rikhavdev in the village of Limodra.\nthe Parm\u00e1r tribe of Rajputs.\\footnote{A person named Chokh\u00e1r\u00e1na the son of Saidavat R\u00e1ja of Ujain, a Rajput of the Parm\u00e1r tribe, quarrelled with his father and retiring to the western hills fixed his residence at the village of Pipla, on the top of a high hill, now called juna or old R\u00e1jippla to distinguish it from the new village of the same name. Bom.Gov.Sel.XXIII.263. Chokh\u00e1r\u00e1na's daughter, as is said, married Samarsi, the son of Mokhd\u00e1i the chief of Piram and Gogha, Chokh\u00e1r\u00e1na must have flourished in the middle of the 14th century.} Soon after this a part of the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da territory would seem to have been under a Rajput chief, with his head-quarters at Godhra or some place near, whose family was, about the middle of the fifteenth century, partially overcome by the ancestors of the present Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chief.\\footnote{Traces of this older Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da family are found in an inscription dated 1129 in a Shaiv temple in the village of Dehjar and in another dated 1328 in the temple of K\u00e9d\u00e1reshvar Mah\u00e1dev in K\u00e1kachia on the Mahi. These chiefs are supposed to be still represented by the Th\u00e1kors of Mehlol in Godhra. According to an account supplied to Mr. H. A. Acworth, C.S., by the family bard of the Mehlol chief, the founder of the house a Solanki Rajput, Gadsingji by name, some time in the eighth century established himself at Godhra. The head of the family remained at Godhra, his territory being separated from Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner by the small river that runs through Vijalpur in K\u00e1lol. In time the family spread, one branch gaining an estate in the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s and another at Sonepur in Th\u00e1sra. Defeated by Mahmud Begada (1484) they retired from Godhra and about 1500 established themselves at Mehlol. They consider that they belong to the Rewa K\u00e1ntha not to the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. In Someshvar's Kirti Kaumudi it is mentioned that in the 13th century the chiefs of Godhra owned allegiance to the V\u00e1ghela chiefs of Dholka. One of them named Dhundhal insulted his superior, who sent an army against Godhra, plundered the town, and making Dhundhal prisoner, carried him to Dholka where he committed suicide. Bhagy\u00e1nl\u00e1l's History of Gujar\u00e1t, 110, 111.} In the middle of the fourteenth century a body of Khichi Choh\u00e1ns, driven south by the Musalm\u00e1ns, settled at Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, which since the overthrow of Anhilv\u00e1da (1304) would seem to have fallen into obscurity.\\footnote{According to bardic accounts Palhansing, the first Choh\u00e1n of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, ruled in the middle of the 13th century.} Under its Choh\u00e1n rulers, until its overthrow by Mahmud Begada (1484), Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner was one of the chief seats of power in eastern Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nDuring this time the Musalm\u00e1n dynasty of Ahmedabad had been established and had brought great part of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha under its sway. By the fall of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner and the establishment there for about fifty years of the head-quarters of Musalm\u00e1n power, almost the whole of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha was brought under submission and much of it well tilled and enriched. After the fall of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner the descendants of Jayasing, the last R\u00e1val, founded the states of Chhota Udepur and B\u00e1riya. In the seventeenth century though trade and prosperity were not restored to the northern parts of the districts, an important trade route passed through the south into Kh\u00e1ndesh and Sankheda, and some other places were centres of considerable commerce.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, though Musalm\u00e1n ascendancy in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha was increased by the conquest by a member of the famous B\u00e1bi family of the territory of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor in the north-west, the power of the Gujar\u00e1t Viceroys began to decline, and the Imperial claims, that had formerly included lands as remote as the Virpur sub-division of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, ceased to be regularly enforced. The local chiefs no longer paid tribute, and began to levy demands from villages.\nfrom which they had long been shut out. This revival of local power did not last long. By 1730 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had appeared in force, and conquering most of the plain lands, levied tribute from all but the poorest and remotest chiefs. At the same time the authority of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s was never firmly established, and the chiefs paid their tribute only under the pressure of military force.\n\nDuring these outside changes, the younger branches of the chiefs' families had from time to time been forced to leave their homes and win for themselves new estates. These cadets of the larger houses, a few daring adventurers, and the descendants of the original chiefs, form the present Th\u00e1kors or landlords of the Sankheda and P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s. During the early years of the present century under the weak misrule of Baroda these small chieftains, except under military pressure, refused to pay their tribute. They plundered the country round and as the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r failed to keep order, the charge of the district was undertaken by the British.\n\nIn 1803 Ajabsing, R\u00e1ja of R\u00e1jpipla, died leaving two sons R\u00e1msing and N\u00e1rsing. These two brothers contended for the chiefship till in 1810, R\u00e1msing died leaving a putative son Prat\u00e1psing. As R\u00e1msing was in possession Prat\u00e1psing was declared R\u00e1ja. Soon after hostilities broke out between him and his uncle N\u00e1rsing, and in 1813 N\u00e1rsing formally claimed the chiefship on the ground that Prat\u00e1psing was not R\u00e1msing's son. N\u00e1rsing's claim was not admitted and the struggle continued till, in 1815, under the plea of settling the points in dispute, the Baroda Government took over the whole management of the country.\n\nAffairs remained in this state till, in 1820, Mr. Willoughby the Assistant Resident at Baroda was sent to R\u00e1jpipla to inquire into the opposing claims. After inquiry he decided that Prat\u00e1psing was not R\u00e1msing's son. In the same year an agreement was concluded with His Highness the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, under the terms of which the control of all the Baroda tributaries vested in the British Government. At the close of 1821 Mr. Willoughby was placed in charge of R\u00e1jpipla and spent nearly three years in putting its affairs in order. In 1823 he also settled the position and tribute of the chiefs of the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s to the north of the Narbada. These arrangements were completed in 1825, and, in the same year, the Baroda authorities placed the territories of the petty chiefs of the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s on the banks of the Mahi under British control. At the same time the political control of Sindia's Panch Mah\u00e1ls was made over to the British, and the B\u00e1riya state was transferred from the Bhop\u00e1var Political Agent. For the charge of these new territories, a special officer was wanted, and on the 6th February 1826, Mr. Willoughby was appointed Political Agent of Rewa K\u00e1ntha, including R\u00e1jpipla, Sindia's Panch Mah\u00e1ls, the Mehv\u00e1si states on the Mahi, the Mehv\u00e1si states on the Narbada, B\u00e1riya, and Chhota Udepur. Soon after, the states of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth that, since\n\n---\n\n1 The Rewa K\u00e1ntha states, though not specially mentioned, were virtually included. Bom, Gov. Sel.

In 1829 the appointment of Political Agent was abolished, and for several years the Rewa K\u00e1ntha chiefs, though nominally under the assistant to the Political Commissioner, were left very much to themselves. This, in 1836, ended in disorder, and in 1839 special control over the N\u00e1ikda country was vested in the assistant commissioner.\u00b9 In 1842 (12th January) under the order of the Court of Directors the office of Political Agent in Rewa K\u00e1ntha was re-established, the criminal powers of the chiefs were graded, and, except of R\u00e1jpipla who was granted the power of life and death, the supplementary jurisdiction of the chiefs was vested in the court of the Political Agent.\u00b2 No further change took place till, in 1853, the state of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor was transferred from the Kaira Collector to the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Political Agent; and in the same year Sindia, for a period of ten years, handed over the administration of the Godhra Panch Mah\u00e1ls to the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Political Agent. Again, in 1862, the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were exchanged by Sindia for districts nearer Gw\u00e1lior, and became British territory. Two years later they were removed from the control of the Agent, and formed into a separate charge. Finally in 1876 the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were raised to the rank of a district, the officer in charge of it having control of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha states.\u00b3\n\nN\u00e1ikda Rising, 1838.\n\nSince 1825 the peace of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha has thrice been broken; in 1838 by a N\u00e1ikda rising; in 1857 by the presence of a rebel force from Upper India; and in 1868 by another N\u00e1ikda disturbance. In 1838 the N\u00e1ikdas of B\u00e1riya, Chhota Udepur, J\u00e1mbughoda, and Godhra were guilty of such excesses that the British Government was forced to take measures to bring them to order. Captain Outram, Political Agent in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, drew up the plan of a campaign, and a force was organized and, in February 1838 under command of Major Forbes, was despatched to the disturbed parts. Military posts were at the same time stationed at several places on the frontier, the fastnesses in which the N\u00e1ikda leaders had taken refuge were surrounded, and inducements were held out to them to surrender. Before the close of the year, with the help of the chiefs of B\u00e1riya and Chhota Udepur and the rulers of Baroda and Gw\u00e1lior, the leading N\u00e1ikdas were either caught or had submitted. Several of them were sentenced to terms of imprisonment, and on giving security for good behaviour the rest were released. These disturbances were caused by two chief gangs of outlaws. Keval of Bara in the district of B\u00e1riya, his brother J\u00e1lam Rupa N\u00e1ik, and his manager Onk\u00e1rsing, the leaders of one of the gangs, helped by Makr\u00e1nis and some malcontents from Udepur and J\u00e1mbughoda, carried off cattle and other property of the R\u00e1ja of Udepur. The other gang under Viram N\u00e1ik, Mah\u00e1dev N\u00e1ik his brother, and Amra N\u00e1ik, laid waste and almost depopulated the lands of R\u00e1jgad. To prevent future disorder the lawless sub-division of S\u00e1gt\u00e1la was\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel.

A post was fixed there, order was established, and the deserted villages resettled.\n\nOn the 26th November 1858 Lieutenant Vibart, commanding at Dohad in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, heard from the Indor Bhil Agent that a body of rebels had entered his districts, and that T\u00e1tia Topi had on the 24th been at Th\u00e1n on the Bombay road between Khorampur and Tulv\u00e1da. Three days later (November 29) the Indor Bhil Agent sent a further message that T\u00e1tia Topi's force, about 3000 strong, had on the 26th crossed the Narbada by a ford below Chik\u00e1l\u00e1da, and moved to Kuksi, a meeting place of roads from Gujar\u00e1t, M\u00e1lwa, and Nim\u00e1r, and that on the next day (27th) a column under Brigadier Park had, at Moipur, crossed the Narbada in pursuit of the rebels. Shortly after, the manager at Amjh\u00e1ra reported that the rebels were at Kuksi on the 28th and that they intended to move on Dohad through Ali R\u00e1jpur. At the same time the Political Agent heard that on the 25th T\u00e1tia Topi was attacked and defeated by a detachment from M\u00e1lwa, that his troops fled towards Vadv\u00e1di ford on the Narbada thirty miles off, and were pursued on the 26th. On the 29th the rebel force entered the Udepur territory. Hearing of their approach the chief, then in the district settling the land revenue, returned to Udepur and shut the gates of its small fort. On the following day (30th November) the rebels arrived and plundered the town. But next morning at daybreak Brigadier Park surprised and dispersed them. Small parties fled south and south-west and at Jh\u00e1bug\u00e1m several of them were made prisoners by a detachment from Baroda. A large body with T\u00e1tia Topi and the person called the R\u00e1o S\u00e1heb arrived at B\u00e1riya on the morning of the 2nd December much worn out, and other small parties wandered about in the B\u00e1riya forests. The main body, with all their elephants but one, had on the first alarm doubled back and made their way through the heavy forest east to Bhabra. From Bhabra they made their way to B\u00e1riya, the whole joining on the 5th at the B\u00e1riya village of Piplod. Meanwhile the B\u00e1riya party joining the other fugitives had moved south-west threatening the H\u00e1lol and Baroda road and returned to Piplod. On the 6th, leaving a covering party at Piplod, the whole force began to retreat in the direction of Jh\u00e1lod. On the next day Captain Muter's detachment advanced from Godhra to Piplod and on the evening of the 8th reached Dohad, the rebels retreating before them but not leaving till they had plundered the towns of Limdi and Jh\u00e1lod. Brigadier Park's column arrived at B\u00e1riya on the 11th, marched to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da on the 13th, and thence on the 14th went to Kad\u00e1na, where Captain Thompson's detachment had arrived from Godhra.\n\nOn the 17th news came that from ten to twenty thousand rebels were to be at Kuksi on the 18th; and a telegram from Sir Hugh Rose told that a body of 700 or 800 rebel cavalry, popularly known as the army of the Peshwa, had crossed the Narbada. As it was rumoured that this force would enter Gujar\u00e1t by the route taken by T\u00e1tia Topi, Captain Collier with two companies of Native Infantry was posted at Chhota Udepur. Jh\u00e1lod was occupied\nby about eighty men of the 33rd Regiment, and Bariya by the rest of the 33rd and two guns. Colonel Collings stopped at Dama Vav in Bariya so as to command the rebel flank, should they advance from Udepur towards Baroda. Lunavada was protected by a British force, and Balasinor strengthened by 100 men of the Kaira police. The freedom of the district from any further inroad of hostile troops was probably due to the careful distribution of these forces.\n\nDuring the mutinies, besides from Tati Topi's raid, Rewa Kantha suffered from local disturbances. Unsettled, perhaps incited by the mutineers, the Bhils and Kolis raised their hands against their well-to-do neighbours, and foreign mercenaries and outlaws defied their chiefs or tried to persuade them to rise against the paramount power. In Lunavada in June 1857, as his claims to the chiefship were not admitted, Surajmal went into outlawry, attacked the town of Lunavada in July (1857), and failing in his attempt fled to Salumber in Meywar. He remained in outlawry for some months. But at length, satisfied by the liberal terms offered by the Raja, he returned to his obedience without causing any disturbance. In 1857 Jamadar Mustafa Khan, the head of the Sunth foreign mercenaries, advanced a claim of \u00a3467 8s. (Rs. 4674) for arrears of pay. This demand was accompanied with such threats that the chief applied to the Political Agent for protection. A party of the Gujarati Irregular Horse under the command of a European officer was, in August 1857, deputed to arrest the Jamadar. The Jamadar resisting the attempt to arrest him was fired at and killed. His followers fled and order was restored.\n\nAbout the middle of August 1857, one Syed Morad Ali attempted to raise a disturbance in Rajpipla and about the same time the chief or vasava of Sagbara also gave trouble. Later, in 1858, under the leadership of Keval Dama and Rupa Gobar, the Naikdas rose in open rebellion and were not put down till a large body of troops had acted against them for eight months. This disturbance was chiefly in the Panch Mahals to which the two leaders belonged. Within Rewa Kantha limits there was some fighting in Udepur and Bariya, but no action of consequence except on the 18th January 1859 a night attack on Lieutenant Richardson's camp. On the 10th March Keval Dama the leading outlaw surrendered to Major Wallace, and on the 23rd May, Rupa Gobar to Captain Hayward. Early in 1859, there were gatherings and threatening movements among the Sankheda Mehwas Bhils. In the month of March the Political Agent moved into the district, convicted nine of the ringleaders, and restored order.\n\nOn the 2nd February 1868, Rupsing Naik of Dandiapur in the Panch Mahals district of Jambughoda, one of the pardoned 1857 rebels, with about 500 men attacked the post of Rajgad in the state of Bariya. He failed in his chief object, the murder of the Bariya Superintendent, who had very shortly before left Rajgad. In other respects the attack was successful. Three of the defenders were killed and three wounded, and about \u00a380 (Rs. 800) in money, the arms and ammunition of the post, two horses, and much private\nproperty were carried away. After the attack on R\u00e1jgad, Rupsing retired into the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, and being joined by N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s and several Makr\u00e1n\u00eds, sacked J\u00e1bbughoda and threatened H\u00e1lol. Among Rupsing's companions was Joria Bhagat, who claimed supernatural power and was styled God, Parmeshvar. Such panic did he inspire among the ignorant people of the district that he gained his first fights without suffering any loss. Flushed with success, on the 6th February he attacked the post of Jetpur in Chhota Udepur. But being met by the chief who with some followers was hunting close by, three of his men were killed. Though this loss to some extent shook the confidence of the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s, their leader sent so defiant a message to the Udepur chief that, giving up the posts of Kadval and Jetpur, he centred his troops for the defence of Chhota Udepur. Before disorder spread further, the Bhagat's head-quarters were attacked by a British force, one of the leading men was slain and two wounded, and open resistance was crushed. Rupsing, the Bhagat, and Rupsing's son Gal\u00e1lia, followed up with untiring vigour, were caught, tried, and hanged.\u00b9 This rising was almost entirely confined to Panch Mah\u00e1ls N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s. Only a few of Rupsing's followers, and these men of no position, belonged to the Rewa K\u00e1ntha states.\n\nWith these exceptions the public peace has, during the last fifty years, remained unbroken. For the levy of the revenue and tribute the display of military force is no longer needed; the favourite crimes of gang robbery and cattle-stealing have to a great extent been suppressed; and disputed boundaries, the fruitful cause of ill-feeling and bloodshed, have been fixed. The last questions to be settled belonged to one class, the relations of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r to the smaller chiefs. Of these one of the most important was the settlement of the rival claims of the Chhota Udepur chief and the Baroda Government to the sub-divisions of V\u00e1sna and Jh\u00e1bug\u00e1m. These sub-divisions, V\u00e1sna with thirty-four and Jh\u00e1bug\u00e1m with eight villages, under the double management of Chhota Udepur and Baroda agents, fell into such disorder that, in the interests of the public peace, they were in 1865 taken in charge by the Political Agent. In the management of the revenues no change was made. Rents were realized as they had been realized before, and the share of each claimant was handed over to him. At the same time steps were taken to record the rights of each party in the different villages, and at last in 1873, it was settled that the Jh\u00e1bug\u00e1m sub-division should be handed over to Chhota Udepur, and V\u00e1sna and a few villages to Baroda. Another difficult point, lately settled, is the control of the sacred town of Ch\u00e1nod, at the meeting of the Or and Narbada. The question of ownership and of civil and criminal jurisdiction was disputed between the M\u00e1ndva chief and the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, the disputes giving rise to much ill-feeling, ending sometimes in a breach of the peace. It has been decided that the town belongs to the M\u00e1ndva chief, that civil and criminal jurisdiction rests with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, and that the M\u00e1ndva chief can\n\n\u00b9 Details are given in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls Statistical Account, 255-258.\nexercise police powers only as his subordinate. Again, there is a wider phase of the same question in the disputes between the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r Government and the petty Rewa K\u00e1ntha Mehv\u00e1s chiefs. The chiefs claim, as the former proprietors, lands and revenues in G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r villages, and these claims the Baroda Government has for years struggled, either altogether or in great part, to disallow. The interest of the earlier Rajput chiefs, in villages conquered by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, varies considerably. In many they still have the chauth r\u00e1nta, that is the ownership and control of one-fourth part of the village; in others they keep the share of the land, but have lost control; and in others both control and land have been lost, but the right to levy a cess remains. By degrees the shares of the original chiefs were divided among heirs and dependents who complicated matters by disposing of them by sale or mortgage. Besides these claimants directly or indirectly representing the original chiefs and landlords, there are the descendants of successful bandits and freebooters, who, with no hereditary right, had in unsettled times succeeded in extorting payments from the villagers. Thus it happened that in 1825 when the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Agency was established, there was scarcely a village in the neighbouring G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory, in which Rewa K\u00e1ntha subjects did not possess a claim of some description. In 1825 under Mr. Willoughby's settlement, the Mehv\u00e1s\u00eds' claims were guaranteed to them. For nearly forty years, chiefs and gir\u00e1s\u00edas tilled their lands, gathered their rents and money dues, and parted freely by mortgage, sale, or gift with their interest in lands within G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r limits. In 1862 the late G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r ordered the levy from alienated lands of a one-eighth share of their rental, and attempted to enforce this levy on the lands and money claims enjoyed by Rewa K\u00e1ntha gir\u00e1s\u00edas within G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r limits. Had not the power of the Political Agent been exercised to prevent it, this demand would have provoked a breach of the peace. The Rewa K\u00e1ntha chiefs were persuaded to remain quiet and leave their claims in the Political Agent's hands. The Baroda Government declined to admit that the guarantee given in Mr. Willoughby's original settlement was enough to establish the gir\u00e1s\u00edas' claims; and points connected with this question were for years in dispute between the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Political Agent and the Baroda state. As matters made no progress towards settlement it was, in 1877, arranged that the gir\u00e1s\u00eda claims should be inquired into and settled by a special British officer. The work of inquiry is still going on.\n\n---\n\n1 Rewa K\u00e1ntha Administration Report, 1870.\n2 No fewer than 2228 original suits and 26 appeals have been brought before this officer.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION.\n\nExcept such portions as they have given away the Rewa K\u00e1ntha lands belong to the chiefs. The heads of the larger states take no share in the actual work of cultivation; some small chieftains, whose income is barely enough to meet their wants, have a home farm tilled by their servants; and proprietors, talukd\u00e1rs, whose estates are too small to let out to tenants, have no resource but to till their own land. Except that they have to pay no part of their produce to superior holders men of this last class do not differ from ordinary cultivators.\n\nTo collect the land revenue the larger states are distributed over sub-divisions, taluk\u00e1s or pargan\u00e1s, each with a commandant, th\u00e1nd\u00e1r, who, besides police and magisterial duties, has, as collector of the revenue, to keep the accounts of his charge, and, except where middlemen are employed, to receive their rents from the villagers. Under the th\u00e1nd\u00e1r to help in revenue work, one or more accountants, tal\u00e1t\u00eds, are generally engaged. In the smaller states and in the petty mehv\u00e1s estates, the proprietors helped by the village V\u00e1nia or a clerk themselves perform these duties. In the small estates under direct British management the revenue is collected by officers called attachers, japtid\u00e1rs, with, if the estate is large, the help of one or two accountants, tal\u00e1t\u00eds.\n\nRewa K\u00e1ntha villages belong to two main classes, state villages held and managed by the chiefs, and private villages alienated or granted under some special agreement. Of private villages there are five varieties; granted, in\u00e1m; held under an agreement, pat\u00e1vat; given as a subsistence, jiv\u00e1k; temple, devasth\u00e1n; charitable, dharm\u00e1da; and held at a fixed rent, udhad. Granted, in\u00e1m, villages, given for some public service to the chiefs, are, as a rule, held either rent-free or on payment of a quit-rent, and are without any condition of service. Agreement, pat\u00e1vat, villages are held on condition of rendering military and other service. When the Rajputs and other strangers overran the country their leaders, keeping the lion's share for themselves, distributed part of the land among their followers on promise of help in times of war. Village holders of this class, besides helping their chiefs in times of war, served with a certain number of horsemen as guards of honour, whenever the chiefs went out of their territories on pilgrimages or\n\n1 In the large states under the direct management of the British Government th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs have no police or magisterial powers.\nother peaceful errands. They were also bound to attend the chiefs on festive or ceremonial occasions, and to add to the grandeur of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s' procession on the Dasera and other holidays. So much honour attached to a large following of these dependent gentry, that in this form of display many of the chiefs sacrificed a great part of their incomes. Villages held under this tenure pay a fixed revenue to the chief who has also the right to levy cesses from the lessees' tenants. These cesses are in most cases fixed, either paid by the lessees themselves or by the villagers direct. They are apportioned either to individual cultivators, or to communities of particular castes. In the latter case the amount is not enhanced even though the community receives fresh members from other villages. A chief may resume an agreement, pata, on the ground of the non-performance of service or other conditions, or on account of failure of heirs. Subsistence, jivak, villages, granted free of service, are held by members of the chiefs' families, or their relations. Though subject to resumption on the failure of heirs, the holder may generally on paying a fee, nazarona, adopt a successor. The land revenue, vaje, of subsistence villages belongs to the holder. But the chief has the right to levy cesses, vera, from the villagers. Temple, devasth\u00e1n, villages cannot be taken back at the wish of the chief. At the same time all are not free from the levy of certain trifling cesses. Charitable, dharm\u00e1da, villages were originally granted to members of the sacred classes, Br\u00e1hmans, Bh\u00e1ts, Ch\u00e1rans, and others in reward either for some religious or ceremonial act, or with the view of securing their blessing, or of gaining for the giver a name for liberality. Some of these villages, alienated by the original holders, are either held by the aliens or have been resumed by the chief. Fixed rent, udhad, villages are mostly owned by mehv\u00e1sis, the descendants of the Koli and Bhil chiefs, who held the country before the Rajput conquest. Holding under the condition of police and military service, these men own their villages, paying a sum which is not liable to increase.\n\nThe following statement shows that in the eight leading Rewa K\u00e1ntha states, of a total of 2544\u00bd villages, 1832 or 71\u00b795 per cent are state, darb\u00e1r; 88 are grant, in\u00e1m; 241 are agreement, patavat; 146 are subsistence, jivak; 22 are temple, devasth\u00e1n; 103\u00bd are charitable, dharm\u00e1da; and 112 are fixed rent, udhad.\n\nRewa K\u00e1ntha Villages,\u00b9 1877.\n\n| State       | State, darb\u00e1r | Grant, in\u00e1m | Agreement, patavat | Subsistence, jivak | Temple, devasth\u00e1n | Charitable, dharm\u00e1da | Fixed rent, udhad | Total |\n|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|\n| R\u00e1jpipla    | 494           | 20          | 70                | 38               | 3               | 48\u00bd                 | ...             | 673\u00bd  |\n| Chhota Udepur | 464         | 2           | 4                 | 27               | 3               | 8                   | 505             | 57    |\n| B\u00e1rlya      | 329           | 44          | 11                | 3                | 2               | 24                  | 413             | 12    |\n| Sanjeli     | 6             | 6           |                   |                  |                 |                     |                 |       |\n| Sanchi      | 213           | 22          | 26                | 13               | 3               | 10                  | 2               | 291   |\n| Kadana      | 60            | 3           | 11                | 28               |                 | 2                   |                 | 124   |\n| Laxm\u00e1da     | 194           | 28          | 84                | 28               | 10              | 9                   |                 | 348   |\n| B\u00e1lasinor   | 52            | 13          |                   |                  |                 | 24                  |                 | 118   |\n| **Total**   | **1632**      | **88**      | **241**           | **146**          | **22**          | **103\u00bd**           | **112**         | **2544\u00bd** |\n\n\u00b9 Owing to the unsettled habits of a large class of the cultivators in every state, the number of villages changes from year to year. The proportion of state, darb\u00e1r, villages is highest in Chhota Udepur and lowest in B\u00e1lasinor.\nThe state, darb\u00e1r, villages, held and managed by the chief, have generally a headman, an accountant, tal\u00e1ti, in charge of a group of villages, a messenger, han\u00e1l\u00e1d\u00e1r, and some families of watchmen, rakh\u00e1s or pagis. There is only one patel to a village, who is both the revenue, mulki, and police patel. A separate police patel is an exception. Assistant headmen, mat\u00e1d\u00e1rs, literally signers, are almost unknown. Carpenters, blacksmiths, and other village craftsmen, found only in a few large Kanbi villages, are generally paid in grain by the villagers. A few of them enjoy rent-free lands. Except when a village has been farmed to them for a certain number of years, headmen do not collect the rent. In state villages the headmen generally accompany the other cultivators when they pay rent to the th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs. Kanbi villages are seldom farmed and Kanbi or Rajput headmen rarely act as middlemen. In almost all villages, both state and private, the lands belong to two main classes, the alienated or part alienated and those held by the state or village proprietor. Of alienated lands there are three main divisions: share, v\u00e1nta; subsistence, pas\u00e1ita; and reward, ranvatia or h\u00e1dia. Besides the petty proprietors, t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, of the Sankheda and P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s who hold shares, v\u00e1nt\u00e1s, in Baroda and a few British villages, other Rajputs enjoy share lands from their chiefs nominally for service, but in practice free from any duty. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth, if unsupported by a deed, sanad, these lands have been made subject to the payment of quit-rent. Lands of this class often include plots taken either by purchase or other means from the original aliens. Subsistence, pas\u00e1ita, grants, in north Rewa K\u00e1ntha known as lot, karamni, lands,\u00b9 are either held by village servants or craftsmen, the vasv\u00e1ya lok or settlers. Some of them are religious or charitable, enjoyed by Hindu or Musalm\u00e1n beggars and strolling players, or are set apart to meet the expense of drawing water for the village cattle or for travellers. Hereditary service holdings, vatans, are unknown in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha. There are no hereditary village accountants, kulikarnis; and the hereditary village headmen, patels, instead of a vatan, have either a pas\u00e1ita grant or are allowed to hold a certain area of land free of assessment. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth, where a quit-rent is imposed on all alienated lands not held under a deed, sanad, pas\u00e1ita lands enjoyed by watchmen and other village servants such as barbers, potters, and sweepers doing state service are excepted, while village servants, blacksmiths, carpenters, and tanners, who are useful only to the village community pay a quarter of the normal rent. Pas\u00e1ita lands held by Br\u00e1hmans and others without deeds pay a quit-rent of one-eighth of the normal rent. Patels enjoy their pas\u00e1ita lands, if supported by deeds free of all state demands or else receive a cash payment in proportion to the size and revenue of the village. Though with no power to do so, the holders of service, pas\u00e1ita, land have in many cases sold or mortgaged their holdings, and in many villages the money-lender holds the land, and the services are no longer performed. To put a stop to this abuse it has lately been decided to make all pas\u00e1ita\n\n\u00b9 Karamni lands are held subject to no condition, and cannot, as a rule, be resumed by the chief.\nChapter VIII.\n\nLand Administration.\n\nAssessment.\n\nlands inalienable and to refuse to recognize any transfer by sale or mortgage. H\u00e1dia is land granted by the state or the villagers in reward for the sacrifice of life on behalf of village or public interests.\n\nIn state lands the form of assessment varies from the roughest billhook or plough cess to the elaborate system in force in British territory. The form of assessment levied from the rudest and most thriftless Bhils and Kolis who till no land, is known in R\u00e1jpipla, where they live chiefly by forest work, as the axe, koh\u00e1di, or the billhook, d\u00e1rdi, cess. In B\u00e1r\u00edya the corresponding tax is known as the squatters', bethalia, or non-workers', or the water, p\u00e1ni, cess, that is on those who do nothing but drink the water of the village. The amount of this tax varies from 1s. to 4s. (ans. 8 - Rs. 2). Somewhat above the foresters and squatters are Bhils and Kolis, too poor to buy or keep bullocks, but who close to their huts dig a plot of ground, v\u00e1da or k\u00e1chha, with a spade or hoe and grow Indian corn in it. These men pay a hoe, v\u00e1da or kod\u00e1li, cess varying according to the size of the plot and the condition of the digger from 1s. to 4s. (ans. 8 - Rs. 2). From those a degree better off who are able to keep bullocks, a plough tax is levied, the amount on each plough varying according to the state and caste of the cultivator, the number of working men in his family, and the number of bullocks at his disposal. One pair of bullocks is estimated to till from 2\u00bd to 7\u00bd acres (5 - 15 bigh\u00e1s). In many places there is much arable waste and to tempt settlers, for the first year only a small charge is made rising gradually till, after three or four years, the full amount is realized. The plough rates vary greatly in different places. They are highest in some of the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s estates ranging in K\u00e1msoli from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a35 (Rs. 25 - 50) a plough; in Pal\u00e1sni from \u00a31 5s. 6d. to \u00a32 5s. 6d. (Rs. 12\u00bd - 22\u00bd); and in Chudesar from \u00a31 12s. to \u00a32 8s. (Rs. 16 - 24). In the larger states the rates vary greatly; in Chhota Udepur from 10s. to \u00a33 10s. (Rs. 5 - 35); in R\u00e1jpipla from 10s. to \u00a31 18s. (Rs. 5 - 19); in B\u00e1r\u00edya from 4s. to \u00a32 2s. (Rs. 2 - 21); and in Sunth from 4s. to 18s. (Rs. 2 - 9).\n\nThe next form of assessment is the crop-share system, bh\u00e1gbat\u00e1i. When the crops are ready to cut, the state managers, k\u00e1md\u00e1rs, examine each field, and with the help of experts make and record an estimate, kaltar, of the crop. On this estimated outturn the money value of the crop is calculated at the ruling price of grain, and the state share is taken in cash. In some cases the estimate is made after the crop is reaped and harvested. The state share varies according to the season, the price of grain, and the honesty of the assessors. It generally amounts to one-third of the rainy season, kharif, and one-fourth of the cold season, rabi, crop. This system prevails in parts of B\u00e1lsinor, Sunth, and the petty estate of Chudesar, and in the alluvial, bh\u00e1tha, lands of M\u00e1ndva in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s. Both under the spade or plough tax and under the crop share, bh\u00e1gbat\u00e1i, systems, the chiefs for their own granary, koth\u00e1r, take from some of their tenants, grain instead of cash. In such cases the value of the grain is always fixed at something below current market rates.\nAmong some of the more settled and intelligent communities a rough form of the separate holding, *kh\u00e1t\u00e1b\u00e1nda*, system has been introduced, and among others cash acre-rates, *bighoti*, are levied. In such cases the holdings are roughly measured into *bigh\u00e1s* or *kumbh\u00e1s*, the *bigha* generally representing about an acre or less, and the *kumbha* varying in different states from one to five *bigh\u00e1s*. After measurement, the assessment is fixed at a certain cash rate on the *bigha*. This rate ranges in R\u00e1jpipla from 4s. to 30s. (Rs. 2 - 15) a *bigha*, or, the R\u00e1jpipla *kumbha* being equal to about 2\u00bd *bigh\u00e1s*, from 10s. to \u00a33 15s. (Rs. 5 - 37\u00bd) a *kumbha*. In the district of B\u00e1riya this assessment is levied in a very few villages at from 4s. to 4s. 6d. (Rs. 2 - 2\u00bd) a *bigha*, and the rate on sugarcane is \u00a31 2s. (Rs. 11). In the state of Sunth it ranges from 1s. to 5s. (Re. \u00bd - 2\u00bd), and the rate on sugarcane from 12s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 6 - 12). In B\u00e1lasinor it varies from 6d. to 14s. (as. 4 - Rs. 7) a *bigha*. The rate in the estate of Dorka is from 2s. to 7s. 6d. (Re. 1 - 3\u00bd) a *bigha*, and 10s. (Rs. 5) a *kumbha*. In the estate of M\u00e1ndva in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s the rate is from 4s. to \u00a31 7s. (Rs. 2 - 13\u00bd) a *kumbha*, which is equal to about 1\u00bc *bigh\u00e1s*. In the estates of Vajiria and Chudesar in the same Mehv\u00e1s, a *kumbha* is equal to about 5 *bigh\u00e1s*; and the rates per *kumbha* in these two estates are from 10s. to \u00a33 18s. (Rs. 5 - 39), and 12s. to \u00a31 15s. (Rs. 6 - 17\u00bd) respectively. In Jiral K\u00e1msoli the rate per *kumbha* which is equal to about 1\u00bd or 2 *bigh\u00e1s* is from 6s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 3 - 12).\n\nIn the state of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da where the land has been regularly surveyed and classified, rates fixed, as in British districts, chiefly on the quality and position of the field, have been introduced under the sanction of the Government of Bombay. The rates vary in dry, *jir\u00e1yat*, lands from 1s. to 5s. 6d. (as. 8 - Rs. 2\u00bd) an acre, and in addition a water rate of from 1s. to 5s. (as. 8 - Rs. 2\u00bd) is levied. The assessment on wells varies from 14s. (Rs. 7) on each water-lift of unbuilt, *kachcha*, well, to \u00a31 and \u00a31 12s. (Rs. 10 and Rs. 16) on each water bag, *kos*, of a built well, that waters at least 2\u00bd acres of land.\n\nExcept in the surveyed states, B\u00e1riya, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and Sunth, where fixed rates are being or have been introduced, the rates levied under the hoe, plough, or crop-share systems are supplemented by cesses of different kinds. Of the cesses no longer in force in the three surveyed states, the most important were those levied to meet the tribute due to the British, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, and Sindia. In B\u00e1riya this, called a horse cess, *ghodi vero*, was supplemented by another known as *chandi vero* or horses\u2019 grain cess. It was levied in kind on every plough, the amount varying with the plough cess from 10 to 130 pounds. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da it was known as the forcible one and a half, *jam\u00e1n\u00f3 dod\u00edyo*, and in Sunth as the robber\u2019s cess, *ganimi vero*.\u00b9 Another cess was the *\u00e1nn\u00e1 tax*, *\u00e1n\u00ed vero*, a surety\u2019s cess of\n\n\u00b9 *Jam\u00e1n\u00f3 dod\u00edyo*, probably a corruption of *julm\u00e1n\u00f3 dod\u00edyo* or the forcible one and a half, was called 1\u00bd because the original amount was raised by one-half. *G\u00e1nim ghoda vero*, in Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed the robber\u2019s cess, was applied by the Musalm\u00e1ns to all Mar\u00e1tha levies. In the Rewa K\u00e1nta the phrase is restricted to taxes imposed by Sindia.\none or two annas in the rupee of the regular assessment, payable partly to the state, partly to the V\u00e1nia security. A third tax was the currency cess, *pota vat\u00fav*, half a per cent on the regular payment to cover loss from bad or damaged coin. Besides these taxes some villagers had to supply the state posts, *th\u00e1n\u00e1s*, with grass either free or at nominal rates, supporting at the same time the men who were sent to gather in the grass. Butter and grain for the use of the state were also taken from the villagers at less than the market rates. In Sunth, besides the Mar\u00e1tha or robber cess, an October, *Div\u00e1l\u00ed*, cess varying from 10s. to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 5\u201325) was, at the time of early harvest, levied on homestead tillage plots, *v\u00e1da* or *k\u00e1chcha*. Other cesses were the funeral butter-cess, *shr\u00e1ddhia ghino vero*, a money payment instead of the share of clarified butter wanted for the funeral rites of the departed heads of the state; the silver coin, *mahmudi*, cess levied from R\u00e1mpur Br\u00e1hman, carpenter, and Gh\u00e1nchi cultivators, when they employ persons of other castes to help them in field work\u00b9; grain compensation, *ped*, a cess levied from certain heads of villages to make up to the state for the loss of its former privilege of taking grain at less than the market rate; the douceur, *sukhdhi chirda*, cess levied by the state and partly paid to V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, who had formerly the right of collecting it; ground-rent, *ghar jhumpi*; and the rope cess, *r\u00e1shio*, to meet the state expenses on ropes. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da the chief cesses were the service cess, *khajmati vero*, levied from some Br\u00e1hmans as a quit-rent on the lands enjoyed by them in return for services rendered to the state officials who estimated the crops; *kalt\u00e1nu*, imposed on some villages instead of food supplied to the clerks sent to assess the crops; *khardo samp\u00e1v\u00e1ni* taken in a few villages for the trouble of telling the people how much rent they had to pay; *kali kalsi*, levied at the rate of one anna on each *kalsi* of grain due under the assessment; *hav\u00e1lo*, levied on account of messengers, *hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs*, in villages where no *hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r* was kept; *khichdi vero*, levied instead of the expenses incurred by some villagers in entertaining the chiefs and their retinue when on tour through the district; the sharers\u2019 cess, *bh\u00e1gia vero*, levied like the *mahmudi* cess on servants employed to help in field work; ground-rent, *ghar jhumpi*, *p\u00e1ga* and *th\u00e1nd\u00e1r l\u00e1gat*, a fee paid to the revenue collector, *th\u00e1nd\u00e1r*, and for the use of horses on occasions of marriage or other processions; *shr\u00e1ddhia ghi*, instead of butter supplied to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s on occasions of funeral ceremonies; a rope cess, *r\u00e1shio*; elephant\u2019s grass cess, *h\u00e1thini gh\u00e1s*; a marriage cess, *kh\u00e1jr\u00fa\u00b2*; Rajput vero, paid by some Rajputs on account of holding service land; the heir\u2019s cess, *kuar chirda*, a fixed cess, originally in honour of the birth of an heir to the chief; October cess, *div\u00e1l\u00ed vero*, on homestead yards, *v\u00e1da*, levied at the time of the early harvest; horse tax, *ghoda vero*, to meet the cost of the chief\u2019s horses; *charv\u00e1d\u00e1r vero*, to pay the attendants, *charv\u00e1d\u00e1rs*, on state horses; and a *gh\u00e1sni veth*, to bring\n\n\u00b9 The *mahmudi* is worth 40 *dokd\u00e1s*. In R\u00e1mpur its present value is Re. 1 as. 2.\n\u00b2 *Kh\u00e1jr\u00fa* means a goat. It is probable that on marriage occasions the people formerly presented the chiefs with a goat and that this was afterwards changed into a money payment.\ngrass into Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. Special cesses were also levied on the occasions of marriages and other events in the chief's family. The Kanbis, as the best-off class of peasants, bore the burden of these cesses. In Chhota Udepur the chief agricultural cesses are: the *kukdi vero*, instead of fowls presented to the chief when on tour; *v\u00e1gh vero*, to pay the R\u00e1ja's tiger-shooting charges; *bh\u00e1t vero*, to pay his bards; and *ch\u00e1ndla vero*, to pay for the marriages, births, and other ceremonies in his family. In R\u00e1jpipla and B\u00e1lasinor the agricultural cesses are the same or similar, and in the state of Vajiria in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, a douceur, *sukhd\u00ed*, of 1s. (8 annas) a *kumbha*, and interest at the rate of twelve per cent (2 annas in the rupee) are levied.\n\nIn the Rewa K\u00e1ntha the land revenue is collected directly by the state officials, or by farmers to whom villages are leased for a fixed or an indefinite number of years. The former system of leasing villages to headmen or money-lenders is giving way to direct state management. The reason for the change is that, except those with few people and scanty tillage, where it is for their interest to attract settlers, villages have been found to suffer lasting harm from the contractors' exactions.\u00b9\n\nIn directly managed villages the want of method on the part of the chief and his officers and the poverty of the peasants make the services of a middleman necessary. The middleman's duties vary in different states. In some states the amount due by each husbandman is fixed, and the work of realizing the rental is left to the V\u00e1n\u00eda or man of capital. He pays for those who cannot pay, and by degrees recovers the money advanced. Under this system the state promptly realizes the whole revenue; but the poorer husbandmen are completely enslaved to the V\u00e1n\u00eda. He credits their grain at what price he pleases, charges them for exchanging the gram into money, and levies interest on any outstandings at the close of the season. In other states the middleman, when an instalment of rent falls due, gives each cultivator an order for the amount of his assessment. This order is taken by the accountant, *tal\u00e1ti*, or the collector, *th\u00e1nd\u00e1r*, cashed, and paid into the treasury. Sometimes the order for payment does not even pass through the cultivators' hands but is paid by the middleman straight into the state treasury. The amounts of the different orders are entered against the cultivators' names, and as his debtors they are entirely in the middleman's hands. The state of affairs in B\u00e1riya in 1865 was thus described by Col. Anderson,\n\n\u00b9 In R\u00e1jpipla, when in 1822 the British Government interfered to clear off the chief's debts, Mr. Willoughby introduced the system of leasing villages. This may have at first been advantageous, but after some years it was found so to impoverish the villages that no leases were renewed, and the villages, as their leases fell in, were managed directly by the chief. This change was in Mr. Pollexfen's opinion (1852-1855), a great gain. Abuses might remain, but anything was better than the lease system which had brought the people to such wretchedness that they had fled from their villages. The leaseholder's one aim was to screw what he could out of his tenants. And besides what he took himself, the people were crushed and robbed by his underlings. Such had been the oppression that in the N\u00e1nchhal sub-division of 97 villages only 31 were inhabited; and the belt of rich land along the left bank of the T\u00e1pti was almost entirely waste and covered with brushwood. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII, 313.\nthe Political Agent. The chief arranges with V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s for the payment of the whole village rental leaving it to the V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 to levy the dues in detail. On all individual payments more than eight months in arrears, the middleman is entitled to a share of the \u00e1ni vero or surety's cess. The middleman's payments are made through the thind\u00e1rs either before or during January, yearly interest at the rate of nine per cent being charged on all sums outstanding. The system suits the middleman. At times he may lose by defaulters. But as a body the people are at his mercy, and he can make his own terms about cash advances and produce prices.\n\nInstalments.\n\nNo regular dates are fixed for paying the assessment. November and December, a month or two after the first harvest is gathered in, is the nominal time for paying either the first instalment or the whole rental. But cultivators are not generally punctual, and during the whole year the officials are at work gathering the revenue.\n\nDefaults.\n\nDefault is very common. The defaulter is generally kept in custody for a day or two at the nearest state post, thana, when he either pays or gives security. If he neither pays nor gives security, his movable property, except field tools and cattle, is attached and sold. Houses are seldom sold, as in most cases both the site and the timber belong to the chief. Occupancy sales are unknown. The large area of arable waste in almost all villages prevents land from having a sale value, and knowing that if he did so, he would suffer either in person or property, a Kanbi is very unwilling to take a Koli's or Bhil's land.\n\nReforms.\n\nAt first, and for many years, the work of putting down disturbances, of checking gang robberies and cattle stealing, and of settling disputes between the different states occupied almost the whole time and attention of the Political Agents. Within the last ten years, aided by the minority of three of the larger states, Bariya, Lunavada, and Sunth, considerable progress has been made in the three important points of surveying, settling alienations, and fixing boundaries.\n\nSurvey.\n\nFor more than twenty-five years after they came under British supervision, except for military purposes, no attempt was made to survey the Rewa K\u00e1ntha districts. The first regular survey was that of R\u00e1jpipla, undertaken in 1852 by Lieutenant J. J. Pollexfen, Assistant Quarter Master General. Lasting through three seasons (1852-1855), the operations included the survey of the lands of 550 villages of which 67 were alienated. A topographical survey of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha and Panch Mahals was, under the charge of R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur Khush\u00e1lr\u00e1i S\u00e1r\u00e1bhai, the present daftard\u00e1r of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Agency, begun in 1854 and finished in 1861. The instruments used were the prismatic compass, and the perambulator. During the seven years the work lasted, the whole of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha and the Panch Mahals, with the exception of Bh\u00e1darva, Um\u00e9ta, R\u00e1ika, Dorka, and Anghad were surveyed, and a map prepared. During the past ten years, advantage has been taken of its being under direct management to survey the lands and fix the boundaries of the Lunavada state. A circuit survey of Bariya,\nLun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and Sunth, and a field survey of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor was, by Mr. Hall of the Gujar\u00e1t Revenue Survey, begun in 1867 and finished in 1871, at a cost to B\u00e1riya of \u00a36915 12s. (Rs. 69,156) and to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da of \u00a34633 16s. (Rs. 46,338). The total number of stations taken in the survey were 10,110 in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and 16,177 in B\u00e1riya, and the total length chained was 956 miles in the former and 1510 miles in the latter. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da the boundaries of 334 villages, and in B\u00e1riya the boundaries of 413 villages were surveyed, settled, and marked out. The whole of the B\u00e1riya frontier was settled, and a length of 205 miles was marked by 2459 substantial stone pillars. A circuit survey of Sunth was carried out during the years 1873, 1874, and 1875 at a cost of about \u00a31792 2s. (Rs. 17,921). The number of stations taken was 7571 and the total area chained 392 square miles. Inner village boundaries were laid down partly by Mr. Hall\u2019s establishment and partly by two officers of the state. The twenty-one villages of the Vajiria estate in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s were in 1870 surveyed and mapped, and their outer boundary line marked off. A field measurement has lately been begun, and the M\u00e1ndva estate has also been surveyed. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, besides the circuit survey, individual holdings in the 185 state villages were measured and classified on survey principles. The result of the field survey was to show that, of a total area of 168,841 acres, 18,026 or ten per cent were taken up by roads, ponds, and village sites; 48,391 or twenty-nine per cent were waste and forest lands; and 102,423 or sixty-one per cent were arable. Of the arable land 74,078 acres or seventy-three per cent belonged to the state; and 28,345 or twenty-seven per cent were alienated. In Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth the rules finally adopted for the settlement of claims to alienated lands were, in the case of lands held under a state grant of temple endowments, and of service grants to village servants useful to the state, entire exemption from payment; a levy of one quarter (4 annas in the rupee) of the normal rent from craftsmen and other village servants not useful to the state; and in all other cases the levy of one-eighth part of the normal rent. Under these rules an inquiry into titles is still going on. In B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor the field measurements show that of a total area of 63,653 acres, 17,717 are waste not available for tillage, and 45,936 acres are arable. Of the total area 19,955 acres or thirty-one per cent are alienated and 43,698 or sixty-nine per cent belong to the state. These lands were measured and classified according to survey rules, but so far no attempt has been made to alter the old system of assessment. The B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor state is making inquiries into titles to alienations and levying quit-rents at various rates.\n\nIn former times boundary disputes gave rise to a large number of murderous affrays. As late as 1864 the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth chiefs quarrelled over some boundary, turned out with their troops, and had a battle on the disputed frontier. The settlement of boundary disputes was first actively taken up in 1866. Long frontier lines were entrusted to single officers as commissioners, and, within three years, most of the disputes were settled, and for the rest the services of a single officer were found to be enough. Of the disputed frontiers, the one between Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor was the most\nimportant. The rival claims chiefly concerned the forty-two villages of the Virpur sub-division. These were placed under attachment by the British Government and the result of a detailed village inquiry was to show that the B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor claims were much the stronger. Other rights of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da in B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor villages and of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da villages were estimated, and the Virpur villages made over to the B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor chief on his agreeing to compound all claims on Lun\u00e1y\u00e1da for a certain sum.\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJUSTICE.\n\nCivil courts have only lately been introduced into the Rewa K\u00e1ntha. Civil disputes were formerly settled by arbitration, and money-lenders were allowed to recover their outstandings as they best could. So anxious were the chiefs to realize for themselves all that could be taken from the cultivators, that, however just his claim, they refused to help a money-lender to recover his debts. Occasionally, when a trader fell into difficulties, his creditors prayed the state to recover for them his outstanding debts, paying as a fee one-fourth part or more of the amount realized.\n\nAt present (1879) there are twelve civil courts in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha, eight in states under the supervision of the British Government, and four others, two in B\u00e1riya, and one each in R\u00e1jpipla and B\u00e1lasinor. Of the eight courts under British supervision the chief is the appellate court of the Political Agent, which hears appeals from the decisions of the assistant political agent. The second is the original and appellate court of the assistant political agent with power to hear original suits of the value of \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000) and upwards in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s; of \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) and upwards in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Sunth, and the P\u00e1ndu and Dorka Mehv\u00e1s; and of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) and upwards in the S\u00e1gt\u00e1la sub-division of B\u00e1riya; and to hear appeals against the decisions of the deputy assistant political agents of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth, and of the S\u00e1gt\u00e1la and the three Mehv\u00e1s th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs. The third and fourth are the courts of the deputy assistant political agents of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth each with power to hear suits of less than \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000). The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth, are the courts of the th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs of Sankheda, P\u00e1ndu, Dorka, and S\u00e1gt\u00e1la, the first with power to hear suits of less than \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000), the second and third of less than \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000), and the fourth of less than \u00a310 (Rs. 100).\n\nIn the towns of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, R\u00e1mpur, B\u00e1riya, and M\u00e1ndva, when immovable or house property is transferred, the state, on receipt of a\n\n---\n\n1 An appeal lies to the Political Agent in all suits relating to immovable property. When the subject of a suit is movable property an appeal lies to the Political Agent only when the property is worth more than \u00a350 (Rs. 500) and the assistant political agent has modified or reversed the original decision. A further appeal lies to Government when the property in dispute is immovable, or if movable of more than \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000) in value, and the Political Agent has modified or reversed the assistant political agent's decree. Gov. Res. 3639, 9th August 1879.\nfee varying from $6\\frac{1}{4}$ to 15 per cent of the value of the property, grants a deed, *lekh*, and enters a copy of it in a state register. It is also usual and in some cases compulsory on payment of fees of from three to five per cent, to register mortgage deeds of real property, wills, and deeds of gift.\n\nIn the conduct of their work the civil courts follow the spirit of the British civil procedure code. Besides a small charge to meet the expenses of the court a fee of $6\\frac{1}{4}$ per cent on the amount in dispute is levied when a suit or an appeal is instituted. When a money claim has been established the debtor's movable and immovable property is liable to be sold. An exception is made in favour of his tools and bullocks, and in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da when grain is attached a portion of it worth \u00a32 (Rs. 20) is set apart for the debtor's maintenance. Imprisonment for debt is unknown. In the case of Bhils and other wild debtors a decree is seldom taken out. There is almost nothing to attach and a troublesome creditor runs great risk of being roughly handled. Cases of this kind are generally settled out of court, the debtor entering into a fresh agreement with the creditor. Most suits are brought against cultivators, and as the claim is generally the outcome of transactions lasting over several years, the rules of the civil procedure code are not strictly followed. An inquiry is made, a rough balance struck, and some arrangement fixed for the payment of what seems due. Cases of attachment and forced sale of property are rare. In the R\u00e1jpipla and B\u00e1lasinor courts institution fees are levied and decrees satisfied out of the judgment debtors' movable and immovable property. From their decisions an appeal lies to the state K\u00e1rbh\u00e1ris.\n\nAs regards criminal justice the Rewa K\u00e1ntha authorities belong to five classes; the officers, *th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs*, who have second and third class magisterial powers in the estates of the petty Mehv\u00e1s chiefs; the third class chiefs of Kad\u00e1na, Sanjeli, Bh\u00e1darva, and Umeta, who have the powers of a second class magistrate in offences committed by any but British subjects; the second class chiefs\u00b9 of B\u00e1riya and B\u00e1lasinor who can try all offenders except British subjects and the subjects of other states accused of capital charges; the first class chief of R\u00e1jpipla who can try all but British subjects for capital offences committed within his territory; and the Political Agent and assistant political agent. Besides having power to try cases in which British subjects are accused, the Political Agent as a magistrate tries cases beyond the powers of the *th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs* in the Mehv\u00e1s estates and the third class chiefs. In addition to this the Political Agent presides as a Sessions Judge in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha criminal court which was established in 1839. In this, assisted by assessors, he tries all British subjects accused of heinous crimes, and all such cases as the chiefs or the local authorities are not competent to settle. He also hears appeals against the decisions of the assistant political agent and of the other inferior courts, and exercises a general supervision over the administration of criminal justice. The assistant political agent\n\n\u00b9 The second class chief of Chhota Udepur has recently been forbidden to try any but his own subjects.\nis vested with the powers of a first class magistrate. He tries all offences committed in the states of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Sunth, Kad\u00e1na, Sanjeli, and S\u00e1gt\u00e1la that are beyond the jurisdiction of the second class magistrates, and decides all cases occurring in the above states as well as those of B\u00e1r\u00edya and B\u00e1ls\u00ednor in which the criminals happen to be British subjects. He has also the power of committing all cases triable by the Court of Sessions and is vested with the power of hearing appeals against the decisions of his deputies at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth and the th\u00e1nd\u00e1r of S\u00e1gt\u00e1la. The deputy assistant political agents of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth and the th\u00e1nd\u00e1r of S\u00e1gt\u00e1la have the powers of second class magistrates. The th\u00e1nd\u00e1r of S\u00e1gt\u00e1la has also been empowered to commit cases to the Court of Sessions.\n\nThe chief crimes are thefts and robberies. This is due not only to the character of the bulk of the people, poor, unsettled and lately brought into order, but to the nature and position of the country, rough with woods and hills, and surrounded by states which almost always refuse to give up offenders.\u00b9 The habit of letting unguarded cattle graze about the hills adds greatly to the number of cattle thefts, and the ease with which, by moving a few thorns in the side of one of their huts, a lover or petty pilferer may find his way inside, swells the list of housebreakings by night. The cases of simple and grievous hurt are almost all the result of the Bhils' excessive love for spirits. On the whole, considering the people and the country, the crime list is by no means heavy, and cases of heinous offences, murders, culpable homicides, and gang robberies are comparatively rare.\u00b2\n\nAs, except in murder cases, there are no arrangements between the Meyw\u00e1r and Rewa K\u00e1ntha states for the surrender of offenders, claims by the people of the different states are inquired into by a court known as the 'International Panch\u00e1yat' which holds its sittings every year in some frontier village. This court consists of the two British political officers in charge of the states concerned who have power to refer cases for settlement to a local panch\u00e1yat. The chief rules for the guidance of the court are, that the claim must be made within a year of the commission of the alleged offence; that travellers are bound to take guides, val\u00e1v\u00e1s, and that if they neglect\n\n\u00b9 In the eastern Sunth villages parties of Bhils from across the Meyw\u00e1r border armed with bows and arrows enter a village and drive off what cattle they find, or they wait their chance till a herd is grazing near the border, and, rushing across, carry them off. The police can do nothing as they cannot follow the offenders across the border. Mr. Prescott, Superintendent of Police.\n\n\u00b2 Mr. Prescott (1874) gives the following details of a dacoity in Sunth. One morning in May, shortly before sunrise, a body of fifteen mounted and armed men, provided with four camels, entered the small village of Sarsan. The villagers offering no resistance, they forced their way into a monastery, robbed it of \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000), and left within an hour. Word was sent to a police post close by, and the police, raising the Bhils as they went along, pursued the robbers, and with the loss of three of their number killed and several wounded, killed two of the robbers, secured six more, and wounded some of the rest who made good their escape. Inquiry showed that the robbers had come from Jodhpur. They were probably induced to make the foray by some false tale of the monastery's wealth.\nChapter IX.\n\nJustice.\n\nCourts of Award.\n\nthis, no claim can stand; that if the complainant is not present the defendant, if he pleads not guilty, may be discharged, and if the defendant fails to appear, the complainant may gain his case by taking an oath as to the justice of his claim; and that the state in whose limits the crime was committed is responsible for the arrest of the offenders and for seeing that the court's sentence is carried out. All sentences are fines, payable as compensation to the complainant, and varying in amount according to the nature of the offence.\\(^1\\) When the officers agree there is no appeal. When they differ the case is referred to the Rajputana Agent to the Governor General. Decisions of local panchayats, in cases referred to them by the political officers, are final. The working of the present system is not satisfactory. In 1874 the president reported that 'he had never seen such an amount of unblushing falsehood and undisguised subornation of evidence,' and in 1878 the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Political Agent urged that the border court should give place to an extradition treaty.\\(^2\\)\n\nPolice.\n\nIn former times the duty of keeping order was entrusted to the mercenary troops, sibandi, both horse and foot, of which the total strength was, in 1854, returned at 1939.\\(^3\\) These troops, without method or discipline, were unfit to keep order. In several parts of the district, especially in the border villages of Gujar\u00e1t and Meyw\u00e1r, the people were in a state of chronic hostility. Receiving little help from their chiefs, they refused to pay them revenue or yield them obedience, and were not brought to order till a special post had been established among them. Besides their police duties, this sibandi was useful in collecting land and other revenue, and served to swell the retinues of the chiefs. In 1865, when B\u00e1riya came under the supervision of the Political Agent, efforts were made to improve the sibandi by introducing some of the method and drill of a regular police force. The attempt was repeated when in 1867 Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da came under direct management. Though some improvement was made the result was not satisfactory. There was no proper supervision. The native assistants had neither the training nor the leisure to look closely after the police. Accordingly when, in 1872, the neighbouring state of Sunth came under direct management, the Political Agent proposed to Government that the police of the three states should be formed into one body. This proposal was approved and a federal police, 441 strong,\\(^4\\) and costing about \u00a35926 (Rs. 59,260), was formed and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Except in the case of murder, when according to the new rules (29th September 1877) instead of a fine the surrender of the offender can be demanded, the amounts of compensation are: for wounding, abduction of married women, forcible abduction of unmarried women, and unlawfully carrying off, arresting, or detaining a person, 2s. to \u00a330; for carrying off a riding camel \u00a38; a baggage camel \u00a35; a she and he buffalo respectively \u00a33 10s. and \u00a31 10s.; a cow \u00a31 10s.; a bullock \u00a32 4s.; a riding pony \u00a31 4s.; a bull \u00a31; a calf 10s.; a sheep 4s.; and a goat 4s.\n\n\\(^2\\) Pol.

The result was satisfactory. There was a marked advance in order and method, and the bands of cattle-lifters and marauders who used to carry their raids into the heart of Sunth were afraid to pass beyond the border villages. In 1876 when the B\u00e1riya chief came of age his police contingent was withdrawn, and to reduce its cost the European officer was replaced by a Native. The B\u00e1riya chief engaging to maintain in efficiency 153 foot and 17 mounted police, the federal force was reduced to 276. Its cost, \u00a33797 (Rs. 37,970), was so heavy a burden to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth, that in 1877-78 it was further reduced to \u00a33152 (Rs. 31,520).\n\nAs regards the police of the other Rewa K\u00e1ntha states, in R\u00e1pipla there are on police duty 100 siband\u00ed, 70 of them foot and 30 horse. The mounted police are armed with guns and swords, and are paid \u00a32 (Rs. 20) a month, out of which the keep of their horses is taken. The foot police wear a black uniform, and are armed with guns, swords, and batons. The Chhota Udepur police is 199 strong, 30 of them mounted and 169 foot. The mounted police, armed with guns and swords, are paid 14s. (Rs. 7) a month, the state feeding their horses and meeting the cost of their keep. The B\u00e1lasinor police is 110 strong, 25 of them mounted and 85 foot. The mounted police, of whom two are officers, are supplied with horses whose keep is met by the state and are paid 10s. (Rs. 5) a month. In the Mehv\u00e1s tracts there is no regular police. The chiefs are too poor to pay for a proper force and too indifferent to exert themselves to keep order and punish offenders. The police of their estates is in the hands of the th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs whose only force is the irregular body of horse known as the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s contingent. This, 314 strong, was originally a force bound by treaty to accompany British troops on service and was afterwards posted to the different tributary districts. Its duties are ill defined. It is used more to stimulate the petty chiefs to arrest offenders than as an active agent in police inquiries.\n\nIn the whole of Rewa K\u00e1ntha there is no regular village police. The duties of revenue and police patels are generally united in one person, who holds service, pas\u00e1ita, land or enjoys some exemption from the payment of plough-tax. They help the police in catching offenders, mustering the bad characters of the village, tracking footprints of thieves, telling the police of accidental or suicidal deaths, and performing other petty police duties. The village watch, rakhs\u00e1s, generally Bhils or Kolis, are paid in the same way as patels, though on a smaller scale. In some cases where there is no state provision, the villagers pay them in grain, the watch agreeing in return to make compensation for all thefts and robberies that may be traced to their dishonesty or want of care.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Prescott, Superintendent of Police.\nThe following table gives the crime and police details for the five years ending 1878-79:\n\n| Year | Offences | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Stolen | Recovered | Percentage |\n|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|--------|-----------|------------|\n| 1874-75 | 1030     | 2331    | 1525        | 60\u00b725      | 1560   | 468       | 29         |\n| 1875-76 | 1247     | 2143    | 1374        | 59\u00b745      | 2062   | 434       | 21         |\n| 1876-77 | 1631     | 2390    | 1482        | 63\u00b700      | 3005   | 810       | 27         |\n| 1877-78 | 2008     | 3531    | 2290        | 64\u00b785      | 5379   | 1041      | 19         |\n| 1878-79 | 3091     | 6333    | 4359        | 68\u00b738      | 7004   | 1832      | 26         |\n\nTill lately there were no jails in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha. Prisoners were confined in rooms attached to the chiefs' dwellings, and, till they paid their fines, were kept in the stocks, ill fed and ill cared for. In the states under direct management, efforts have been made to improve the jail accommodation. New jails have been built in B\u00e1riya, R\u00e1mpur, R\u00e1jpipla, and B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, and in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da the state granary has been prepared to receive prisoners. There are nineteen lock-ups, and a jail is shortly to be built at Chhota Udepur. In B\u00e1riya, Sunth, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and R\u00e1jpipla, the health of the convicts is looked after by medical officers in charge of local dispensaries. Except a few at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da who make tape for cots the convicts are kept at out-door labour.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nREVENUE AND FINANCE.\n\nIn former times the disturbed state and isolated position of the country, the rivalry among the chiefs to secure settlers, and the lavish grants of land to Br\u0101hmans, Bh\u0101ts, and others, prevented the land from yielding any large amount of revenue. Between 1863 and 1865 the rise in the price of field produce fostered the spread of tillage, and increased the rental of rich lands. Since then, by the opening of railways and roads, the tillage area has continued to spread, and, except for the loss caused by the failure of crops in 1878, the land revenue has steadily risen.\n\nFew details of the finances of the different states are available. The R\u0101jpipla revenues which, from disorders and disputed successions, fell from \u00a334,558 (Rs. 3,45,580) in 1776 to \u00a317,636 (Rs. 1,76,360) in 1830, have since 1830 steadily risen to \u00a327,000 (Rs. 2,70,000) in 1854 and \u00a367,967 (Rs. 6,79,670) in 1876. Of the expenditure very little is recorded, and, as in all native states, pilgrimages, marriages, deaths, or other chance events in the chief's family cause such sudden changes in expenditure, that it is hard to say how far the great advance in revenue has been swallowed up by an increase in charges. The few available materials seem to show that the R\u0101jpipla finances are prosperous. Between 1829 and 1833 the expenditure far outran the revenue, \u00a324,556 against \u00a317,636; between 1833 and 1839 and again between 1840 and 1848 the balance was restored, and of \u00a322,463 to \u00a320,640 only about \u00a318,000 were on an average spent. Since 1850 the great increase of revenue has been accompanied by a marked rise in expenditure, from \u00a318,015 in 1848 to \u00a360,935 in 1876. Still this amount falls about \u00a37000 short of the estimated revenue, and much more of it than formerly is spent on works of public use, on roads, police, courts of justice, and dispensaries.\n\nThe B\u0101riya revenue figures do not go further back than 1825. In that year the revenue was returned at \u00a36117; in 1860 it had risen to \u00a39375; and in 1864 when the state came under British management it stood at \u00a315,231. From this it rose to \u00a316,028 in 1870, \u00a320,190 in 1871, and \u00a319,823 in 1872. Afterwards, except in 1874 when by the receipt of marriage dowries the total was swollen to \u00a322,520, the revenue declined to about \u00a317,000 in 1875 and 1876.\n\n---\n\n1 The details are: an average of \u00a334,558 from 1776 to 1785; of \u00a325,940 from 1794 to 1803; of \u00a325,016 from 1804 to 1810; of \u00a323,796 from 1810 to 1819; of \u00a322,122 from 1821 to 1828; of \u00a317,636 from 1829 to 1833; of \u00a322,463 from 1833 to 1839; of \u00a320,640 from 1840 to 1848; \u00a327,000 in 1854, and \u00a367,967 in 1876. The 1878 estimate is \u00a380,000.\nChapter X.\nRevenue and Finance.\n\nB\u00e1riya.\n\nSince 1876, owing to extended cultivation and better management, it has again risen to more than \u00a318,000. When the state was taken over in 1864 it was burdened by a debt of \u00a310,803. The expenditure was then \u00a37935. Outlay on a revenue survey, roads, and other public works, raised the expenditure to \u00a39421 in 1870, to \u00a316,338 in 1871, to \u00a316,937 in 1872, and to \u00a312,259 in 1873. In 1874 the double marriage of the chief increased the charges to \u00a324,726, but in spite of this, in 1877, when his state was handed over to the chief, there was, instead of a debt of \u00a310,803, a cash balance of \u00a318,111. During the last two years, in 1877 on account of investiture charges, and in 1878 on account of famine charges amounting to \u00a34028, the expenditure has been in excess of the income. Still the B\u00e1riya finances are prosperous and satisfactory.\n\nLun\u00e1v\u00e1da.\n\nThe Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da revenue rose from \u00a36742 in 1852 to \u00a38289 in 1859 and \u00a311,113 in 1866. Then under the management of the Political Agent it increased to \u00a312,903 in 1872 and \u00a314,830 in 1874. In 1876 it fell to \u00a312,833, but has since, in spite of the last year of scarcity, slightly risen to \u00a313,558. In 1867 when it came under direct management, the expenditure was returned at \u00a312,429. Since then, in spite of economy, survey and other public works have prevented any reduction of charges, and in 1878 the marriage of the chief and the high price of grain raised the expenditure to \u00a316,425. When it came under management, the state was heavily burdened, and during the first year the debt was greatly increased by the succession fee of \u00a38256 to the British Government, and an outlay of \u00a39537 on funeral and other family ceremonies. In spite of these and other heavy charges, \u00a310,280 for the revenue survey and \u00a34000 for the marriage of the chief's sister, by 1877 the debt was reduced to \u00a36466. In that and the next year expenses connected with the scarcity and the chief's marriage have again raised it to \u00a312,129. But it is hoped that during the present season this debt will be reduced by about \u00a33000, the proceeds of a special marriage cess, ch\u00e1ndla vero.\n\nSunth.\n\nThe land revenue of Sunth was in 1854 returned at \u00a31317. During the next eighteen years of his rule the late R\u00e1ja raised it to \u00a36000 or an increase of 460 per cent. In 1868 the total state revenue was returned at \u00a38297. The state came under Agency management in 1872. Since then, by the sale of some state stores, rising to \u00a319,381 in 1873, the revenue has fallen to \u00a311,180 in 1874, and to about \u00a39000 in 1876 and 1878. The expenditure in 1868, returned at \u00a35680, rose from special causes to \u00a314,814 in 1874, and has since been reduced to \u00a39160. Well managed by its late chief, the state was, in 1872, handed over with about \u00a324,000\n\n---\n\n1 The details are: \u00a36117 in 1825; \u00a39375 in 1860; \u00a315,231 in 1864; \u00a316,028 in 1870; \u00a319,823 in 1872; \u00a317,976 in 1873; \u00a322,520 in 1874; \u00a317,001 in 1875; \u00a317,209 in 1876; \u00a318,644 in 1877; and \u00a318,226 in 1878.\n\n2 The details are: \u00a36742 in 1852; \u00a38289 in 1859; \u00a311,113 in 1866; \u00a312,842 in 1868; \u00a313,500 in 1870; \u00a312,903 in 1871; \u00a312,903 in 1872; \u00a311,465 in 1873; \u00a314,830 in 1874; \u00a314,794 in 1875; \u00a312,533 in 1876; \u00a313,720 in 1877; and \u00a313,558 in 1878.\n\n3 The details are: \u00a38297 in 1868; \u00a319,381 in 1873; \u00a311,180 in 1874; \u00a312,404 in 1875; \u00a39385 in 1876; \u00a310,147 in 1877, and \u00a39252 in 1878.\n(Baroda Rs. 2\u00bd l\u0101khs) in cash and jewels. Under Agency management, in spite of heavy family charges and considerable sums spent on a revenue survey and on police, the finances of the state have on the whole continued prosperous.\n\nThe few details available for other states seem to show a marked increase in wealth. In Chhota Udepur revenue has risen from \u00a38000 in 1841 to \u00a310,000 in 1854, and from that to \u00a325,000 in 1878; in B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, since 1854, from \u00a34000 to \u00a33000; in Sanjeli from \u00a3100 in 1841 to \u00a3140 in 1849, and to \u00a3510 in 1878; and in Kad\u00e1na from \u00a3120 in 1841 to \u00a3250 in 1849, and \u00a31000 in 1878. In these states no expenditure details are available.\n\nImport, export, and transit duties are levied on an uncertain number of articles, additions and changes being made at the caprice of the chiefs. Besides those levied by the larger states, the smaller chiefs charge tolls, vas\u00e1vo, on traders' carts and on pack bullocks. Merchants refusing to pay, seldom escape without being robbed. In Sunth a hurtful grain export duty is levied, but it is difficult to remove it without causing serious loss to the state revenues. Of other cesses the chief is a license tax, kasab vero, levied from almost all traders and artisans.\u00b9 In M\u00e1ndva, in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, a cess is levied on all second marriages. In Ch\u00e1nod from 10s. to \u00a35 (Rs. 5 - 50) is claimed on newly made doors or windows, and at fairs from \u00a31 to 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 10 - 1 anna) is taken from each booth or stall. In B\u00e1r\u00edya, wandering comb-makers pay for the wood they use in making combs, and from outside timber-dealers a wood cess is recovered. In Sunth the holders of service, pat\u00e1vat, land pay a yearly sum in commutation of service, and in many states, villagers who have no land pay a cess for the use of the village water, p\u00e1n\u00ed vero. Of other cesses one at the rate of 1s. (8 annas) is levied on the burning of bodies brought from other districts, and another of \u00a31 2s. (Rs. 11) on Br\u00e1hmans who, at holy places on the Narbada, lay the spirits of the dead and perform other ceremonies.\u00b2 Other yearly cesses date, according to the common story, from some chance injudicious gift. A Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chief stopping to dine at one of his villages, the Br\u00e1hmans brought him a set of leaf plates and so established the precedent for a yearly demand for plates, afterwards commuted into a money payment. So too from the gift by some calenders, of robes for the chief to sit on, was founded a yearly claim for clothes and money; and a yearly grass cess dates from the chance supply of fodder for the chief's horses.\n\n\u00b9 The tax is levied on carpenters and blacksmiths; on tanners; on hand-loom weavers; on soap makers; on Narbada boatmen; on goldsmiths; on oilmen; on fishermen; on dust-heap searchers; and on potters.\n\n\u00b2 This, called the N\u00e1r\u00e1yan offering, N\u00e1r\u00e1yan b\u00e1li, ceremony, consists in the performance of shr\u00e1ddh ceremonies in honour of some dead relative, who, it is believed, has not attained bliss in the other world. Childless persons also perform this ceremony to propitiate N\u00e1r\u00e1yan.\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nINSTRUCTION.\n\nIn 1878-79 there were sixty-seven schools, or on an average one school for every fifty-two villages, with 3448 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 3335 or 1\u00b73 per cent of 260,278, the entire population of not more than twenty years of age. Excluding superintendence charges, the total expenditure on account of these schools was \u00a31723 (Rs. 17,230).\n\nUnder the Director of public instruction and the Education Inspector, northern division, the schooling of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha district was in 1878-79, conducted by a local staff 130 strong. Of these one was an assistant deputy inspector, with general charge over all the schools of the district drawing a yearly pay of \u00a395 (Rs. 950) from the Rewa K\u00e1ntha education and the B\u00e1riya tribute funds; the rest were masters and assistant masters of schools, supported at a yearly charge to the states of \u00a3112 (Rs. 1120).\n\nOf sixty-seven, the total number of schools, in sixty-six Gujar\u00e1ti only was taught, and in one Hindust\u00e1ni. Of the Gujar\u00e1ti schools three were for girls, in the towns of N\u00e1ndod, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and B\u00e1las\u00ednor.\n\nThere are no aided private schools in the district. Before the introduction of state education, almost every Rewa K\u00e1ntha village had its private school taught by a Br\u00e1hman. These could not compete with schools helped or supported by state funds, and their number fell in 1875-76 to nine with an average attendance of 269 pupils. During the rainy season stray Br\u00e1hmans sometimes open temporary classes in villages unprovided with state schools. But most of these villages are small, unable to supply an attendance of more than ten boys. For two or three of the rainy months and at harvest times the Br\u00e1hman teacher is generally paid in grain and sometimes in money. His total receipts generally vary from \u00a35 to \u00a37 10s. (Rs. 50 - 75). Most private schools in towns have been established by the forefathers of the present Br\u00e1hman teachers. On entering the school, a boy offers 1s. (8 annas) to Sarasvati, the goddess of learning. Every day he attends, he brings the teacher a handful of grain, muthi, and on holidays, \u00bdd. (\u00bd anna) in addition. When a boy is going to be married, his teacher gets 2s. (Re. 1) for teaching him marriage songs. Boys seldom stay at these schools after twelve and most of the pupils are under ten. Girls, as a rule, do not attend them. Between six and eight, boys are taught native numerical tables, \u00e1ns. Afterwards they learn to write by tracing letters, mul\u00e1kshars, on sanded boards, and by writing characters,\nn\u00e1ma, with wet chalk on black boards. They seldom learn writing well, but mental arithmetic, his\u00e1b, is taught to perfection, and this part of their teaching has been adopted in state schools. The boys go to their teacher's dwelling and as his house is often small, in the mornings and evenings the pupils sit in a group at the side of the street in front of the school-door, working sums or shouting out arithmetical tables.\u00b9 The position of the masters, and the religious elements in some parts of their instruction, greatly help them in their competition with the purely secular instruction given in state schools.\n\nIn 1864-65 there were thirteen schools, eleven for boys and two for girls, with a total number of 1023 pupils. In 1878-79 the number of schools had risen to 67 or 515 per cent, and the number of pupils to 3448 or 337 per cent. The following table shows in detail the advance made in the last fourteen years:\n\n| State          | Schools | Pupils | Average Attendance | Year | Cost |\n|----------------|---------|--------|--------------------|------|------|\n|                | 1864-65 | 1878-79 | 1864-65 | 1878-79 | 1864-65 | 1878-79 |\n| B\u00e1riya        | Boys 1  | 15     | 77     | 601    | 609-9 | 15   | 400  |\n|               | Girls 1 |        |        |        |       |      |      |\n| Lnn\u00e1v\u00e1da      | Boys 12 | 156    | 788    | 888-0  | 31-5  | 25   | 354  |\n|               | Girls 10|        |        |        |       |      |      |\n| R\u00e1jpipla      | Boys 1  | 133    | 742    | 721-1  | 32-5  | 2    | 364  |\n|               | Girls 1 |        |        |        |       |      |      |\n| Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s| 7     |        | 287    | 242-8  |       |      | 162  |\n| Sunth         | 1      | 7      | 54     | 225    | 225-8 | 15   | 163  |\n| Chhota Udepur | 2      | 5      | 98     | 146    | 133-8 | 21   | 114  |\n| B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor     | Boys 2  | 419    | 448    | 404-6  | 85-5  | 54   | 93   |\n|               | Girls 1 |        |        |        |       |      |      |\n| P\u00e1n\u00e1da Mehv\u00e1s | 3      |        | 25     | 29-3   |       |      | 27   |\n| Bud\u00e1rra       | 1      | 55     | 125    | 118-3  | 19    | 16   |      |\n| Dorka Mehv\u00e1s  | 1      | 31     | 31     | 18-0   | 18    | 17   |      |\n| Kad\u00e1na        | 1      |        | 19     | 28-2   |       |      | 21   |\n| Sanjeli       | 1      |        | 11     | 9-0    |       |      | 3    |\n| Total         | 13     | 67     | 1023   | 3448   | 167   | 1723 |\n\nThe 1872 census returns give for the two chief races of the district, the following proportion of persons able to read and write. Of 93,904, the total Hindu male population of not more than twelve years of age 2836 or 3\u00b702 per cent; of 42,583 above twelve and not more than twenty years, 2599 or 6\u00b710 per cent; and of 122,679 above twenty years, 7796 or 6\u00b735 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught. Of 82,085 the total Hindu female population of not more than twelve years of age, seventy-two or 0\u00b708 per cent; of 32,124 above twelve and not more than twenty years of age, thirty-two or 0\u00b709 per cent; and of 112,049 above twenty years, fifty-eight or 0\u00b705 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught. Of 3508 the total Musalm\u00e1n male population of not more than twelve years of age, 117 or 3\u00b734 per cent; of 1703 above twelve and not more than twenty years of age, 175 or 10\u00b728 per cent; and of 5586 above twenty\n\n\u00b9 The school hours are from eight to about twelve in the morning, and three to about six in the afternoon.\nyears, 511 or 9\u00b715 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught. Of 2951 the total Musalm\u00e1n female population of not more than twelve years of age, nine or 0\u00b731 per cent; of 1334 above twelve and not more than twenty years of age, eight or 0\u00b760 per cent; and of 5022 above twenty years, 22 or 0\u00b743 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught. The returns do not give corresponding details for P\u00e1rsis.\n\nOf 3448 the total number of pupils in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha schools, there were in 1878-79, 949 or 27\u00b75 per cent Br\u00e1hmans; 184 or 5\u00b73 per cent Kshatris; 8 or 0\u00b72 per cent K\u00e1yasths and Parbhus; 740 or 21\u00b74 per cent traders, V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, and M\u00f3di\u00e1s; 55 or 1\u00b75 per cent Jains (Shr\u00e1vaks); 694 or 20\u00b71 per cent cultivators, Kanbis, and Kolis; 230 or 6\u00b76 per cent craftsmen, goldsmiths, carpenters, and blacksmiths; 152 or 4\u00b74 per cent personal servants, Dhobhis washermen, Bh\u00edstis water-carriers, and Moch\u00eds shoemakers; 124 or 2\u00b76 per cent bards and genealogists, Bh\u00e1ts and Ch\u00e1rans; 208 or 6\u00b703 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns; 5 P\u00e1rsis; 5 hill tribemen, and 3 Portuguese. There were no Dhed or Bhangia pupils. In B\u00e1riya, in the purely Bhil and Koli villages, no school fee is charged and every inducement is held out to parents to send their children. In the T\u00e1luka schools of B\u00e1riya and Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da pupil teachers are trained to be masters of primary village schools, and scholarships are awarded to those who wish to study in the Ahmedabad high and training schools, or in the Nari\u00e1d high school. The Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da state has awarded a monthly scholarship of \u00a31 to a native of that state who passed the Bombay University matriculation examination.\n\nThere are three libraries, at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, at Devgad in the B\u00e1riya state, and at R\u00e1mpur in Sunth. The Barton library at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, called after Colonel Barton the late Political Agent, was established in May 1870. It is accommodated in one of the school rooms, and is maintained by a yearly grant of \u00a38 16s. (100 syh\u00e1s\u00e1i rupees). It contains 118 books, almost all of them vernacular. The Devgad library, known as the Native Library, established in July 1872 and containing 123 books, almost all of them vernacular, is maintained by a yearly grant of \u00a38 16s. (100 syh\u00e1s\u00e1i rupees). The R\u00e1mpur library, opened in 1877, has very few books, almost all of them vernacular. It is maintained by a yearly state grant of \u00a35 (Rs. 50). All of these institutions subscribe to Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed newspapers, and Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed and Mar\u00e1thi Bombay and Gujar\u00e1t periodicals. There is no local press or newspaper.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThe chief diseases are fever, eye and skin complaints, and diarrhoea and dysentery. Cholera not unfrequently appears in the hot season. There have been three outbreaks during the last four years. In May 1875, several cases of cholera caused such a panic, that in some places the people left their houses and spent a day or two feasting outside of the villages. Except for a short time in the estates of Bh\u00e1darva and Sihora on the Mahi and Pal\u00e1sni on the Narbada, the disease was nowhere of a virulent type. It lasted till September and proved fatal in about forty-five per cent of the cases. To help the people a hospital assistant was sent from Baroda, and medicine distributed free of charge. Among the wilder tribes the belief prevails that cholera is caused by old women who feed on the corpses of the victims. Formerly when a case occurred, their first care was to go to the soothsayer, bhagat, find out from him who was the guilty witch, and kill her with much torture. Of late years this practice has to a great extent ceased. The people now trace the outbreak to the wrath of the goddess K\u00e1li and to please her, drag her cart through their streets and lifting it over the village boundary offer up goats and buffaloes. Sometimes to keep off the disease they pour milk round their villages or encircle them with cotton thread.\n\nIn July 1876, there was another rather sharp, though brief, outbreak in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Sunth, and the Dorka Mehv\u00e1s. Of the seizures about forty-nine per cent were fatal. Again in 1878, cholera raged from March to November, and of 3934 persons, 1766 or forty-five per cent died. It spread over almost the whole Agency beginning in R\u00e1jpipla, B\u00e1lasinor, and the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s; and passing to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Sunth, Kad\u00e1na and the P\u00e1ndu and Dorka Mehv\u00e1s. Places without dispensaries were provided with medicine free of charge.\n\nIn 1879, there were dispensaries at five places in N\u00e1ndod, B\u00e1riya, Sunth, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and Chhota Udepur. All of them are provided\n\n---\n\n1 The details are:\n\n|                | R\u00e1jpipla | Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da | Sunth. | B\u00e1lasinor | Sankheda | P\u00e1ndu | Dorka | Kad\u00e1na | Total |\n|----------------|----------|----------|--------|-----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|-------|\n| Number attacked | 1332     | 614      | 672    | 640       | 313      | 283   | 64    | 116    | 3934  |\n| Number recovered | 631     | 340      | 551    | 242       | 118      | 135   | 45    | 76     | 2168  |\n| Percentage      | 47\u00b70     | 66\u00b70     | 66\u00b70   | 39\u00b70      | 30\u00b70     | 49\u00b70  | 70\u00b70  | 66\u00b70   | 55    |\n\n2 The building for a sixth dispensary at B\u00e1lasinor is nearly ready.\nChapter XII.\n\nHealth.\n\nDispensaries.\n\nN\u00e1ndod.\n\nwith special buildings. For the Chhota Udepur dispensary no returns are available. In the other four, during 1877-78, 17,553 persons were treated, 335 of them in-door and 17,218 out-door. The total cost was \u00a3730 (Rs. 7300).\n\nIn the Mary hospital opened in 1871 at N\u00e1ndod and called after Mrs. Barton, the wife of the late Political Agent, during 1877-78, 2484 persons were treated, of whom 2451 were out-door and 33 in-door. Of these 2428 were cured, 29 left, and 27 died. The prevailing diseases were ague, dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera, and skin diseases. The total cost was \u00a3167 (Rs. 1670).\n\nB\u00e1riya.\n\nThe B\u00e1riya dispensary was opened in 1870 at a cost of \u00a3700 (Rs. 7000). Besides accommodation for in-door patients, it contains quarters for the medical officer and his subordinates. In 1877-78, 3173 persons were under treatment, 215 of them in-door, of whom 46 were cured, 30 left and 79 died, and 2958 out-door patients of whom 2054 were cured. The chief forms of sickness were venereal diseases, skin diseases, fever, cholera, ophthalmia, and diseases of the stomach and bowels. The total cost was \u00a3250 (Rs. 2500).\n\nSunth.\n\nThe R\u00e1mpur dispensary in a handsome building at the west end of Sunth was at a cost of \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000) opened in December 1873, soon after the state was attached. Besides accommodation for several in-door patients it contains quarters for the medical officer and his subordinates. In 1877-78, 4559 persons were under treatment, of whom 4492 were out-door and 67 in-door patients. Of the out-door patients 4122 were cured, 240 left, 94 died, and 36 remained. Of the in-door, 50 were cured, 13 left, two died and two remained. The daily average attendance was 39. The chief diseases were fever, constipation, bronchitis, cholera, diarrhoea, ulcers, ring-worm, and ophthalmia. The total cost was \u00a3142 (Rs. 1420).\n\nLun\u00e1v\u00e1da.\n\nThe Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da dispensary was opened in June 1873 in a large house belonging to the state with quarters for the medical officer and rooms for in-door patients. Of 7337 persons treated during 1877-78, twenty were in-door and 7317 out-door patients. The former were all cured. Of the latter 6100 were cured, 949 left, 125 died, and 143 remained. The daily average attendance was 63\u00b72. The prevailing diseases were fever, cholera, rheumatism, neuralgia, conjunctivitis, ulcers, bronchitis, dysentery, diarrhoea, constipation, and ring-worm. The total cost was \u00a3171 (Rs. 1710).\n\nChhota Udepur.\n\nThe Chhota Udepur dispensary was opened in 1878-79. No details of its working are yet available. The building for a dispensary at B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor is nearly finished. It will cost about \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000).\n\nVaccination.\n\nThe work of vaccination was, in 1878-79 under the supervision of the deputy sanitary commissioner eastern Gujar\u00e1t, carried on by twelve vaccinators paid out of the funds of the states to which they are attached. The cost was \u00a3278 (Rs. 2780) or an average of 5\u00bd (3 as. 4 pies) for each operation. During the year, 13,339 persons were vaccinated, 13,247 of them for the first time. The percentage of successful operations was 96\u00b754 in primary and 82\u00b760 in revaccinated cases.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nSTATES.\u00b9\n\nRa'jpipla, the largest of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha states, lying between 21\u00b023' and 21\u00b059' north latitude and 73\u00b05' and 74\u00b00' east longitude, with an area of about 1500 square miles, had in 1872 a population of 120,036 souls or 79\u00b726 to the square mile, and in 1878 a revenue of \u00a367,000 (Rs. 6,70,000).\n\nIt is bounded on the north by the river Narbada and the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s estates; on the east by the Kh\u00e1ndesh Mehv\u00e1s estates; on the south by Baroda territory and the Surat district; and on the west by the district of Broach. Its length from north to south is forty-two and its breadth from east to west sixty miles.\n\nAs they enter Gujar\u00e1t, the Narbada and T\u00e1phi, separated by the S\u00e1tpud\u00e1 hills, flow about twenty-five miles apart. Further west, forced asunder by the two ranges into which the S\u00e1tpud\u00e1s break, the rivers swerve outwards, in the next twenty-five miles doubling the distance between them. Again as the hills fall into the Gujar\u00e1t plain, the streams draw together nearly as close as they were at the eastern border of Gujar\u00e1t. Except the south-west corner the country so enclosed belongs to, and forms the greater part of, the R\u00e1jpipla state. With some rich well tilled lands in the north and north-west this tract is, over almost two-thirds of its surface, rough, wild, and unhealthy, covered with forests and hills. Along the north and north-west, and in the west as far as Vasr\u00e1vi and M\u00e1ndvi, the country is flat and open. In the north along the Narbada is a rich alluvial belt about ten miles broad, with the town of N\u00e1ndod and many large villages of settled, well-to-do, and skilled husbandmen. In the west and south-west the land, except for patches round its small Bhil villages, is untilled and covered with grass and brushwood.\u00b2 Eastwards, beyond the sources of the Kim, the country stretches a rough upland covered with elephant grass, thorn-bushes, and timber, dotted with small hills, and crossed from the south and south-east by the Karjan and Tarav rivers. Its few inhabitants are Bhils, wild, poor and unsettled, growing only the coarser grains. Except to the west this central plain is, on all sides, surrounded by hills. To the north, beginning in the west with low isolated mounds, the land rises eastwards into a ten mile\n\n\u00b9 The states are arranged according to their size and wealth.\n\u00b2 Colonel Fulljames calls it (1852) a thick forest. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 112.\nbroad tract of hills, ridge behind ridge, with steep forest-clad sides and sharp rugged crests and peaks 2000 feet high. To the south-west and south, the hills are low with tame waving outlines and broad flat tops. To the east the S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra and other high ranges rise with bold outline far above the west R\u00e1jpipla hills almost to the level of the main range of the S\u00e1tput\u00e1s. In all these hilly tracts the climate is most unwholesome and the poor unsettled tribes of Bhils, with little and coarse tillage, live chiefly by cutting timber and selling gum, honey, and wax. Besides the tract between the T\u00e1pti and the Narbada the R\u00e1jpipla chief owns land on the north bank of the Narbada. This about twenty-one miles north and south by eight east and west is, except on the river side, surrounded by Mehv\u00e1s estates and like them is rugged, wooded, and unhealthy.\n\nThe drainage of the tract between the T\u00e1pti and Narbada flows along three main lines, north-west to the Narbada, south-west to the Kim, and south to the T\u00e1pti. Of these lines the most important, including the drainage of almost the whole central and eastern uplands, lies along the rivers that flow into the Narbada. Of these streams there are, in the extreme east, the Deva, and in the north-west and west the Madhumati, Bundva, K\u00e1veri, and Amr\u00e1vati. Midway between them, rising about ten miles from the T\u00e1pti in the highest part of the southern range, the Karjan flows north draining the central uplands, cutting through the northern hills, crossing the rich N\u00e1ndod plain, and after a course of about fifty miles, falling into the Narbada at Rundh. Among the hills with steep well-wooded banks and rocky bed, it passes into the plains about fifty yards broad, the stream generally knee-deep, flowing throughout the year clear and sparkling. Of many tributaries the chief are the Mohan from the left and the Tarav from the right. The Mohan, rising in the southern hills not far from the southern source of the Vari, flows north-west and after a course of about fifteen miles, falls into the Karjan at Thava. The Tarav, a more important tributary, rising in the lofty hills near Chich \u00c1mli, flows west for about twenty miles, and then, joined from the left by the Dainan, turns north, and after a winding course of about twelve miles, falls into the Karjan a few miles west of the fort of R\u00e1jpipla. Of the drainage westwards, the Kim, rising in two streams a few miles west of the Karjan valley, flows about twenty miles to the south-west. From the southern hills three rivers drain south into the T\u00e1pti, the Vari in the west, the \u00c1j\u00e1n in the centre, and the Dudan in the east. The Vari with two streams rising in the south-west corner of the southern hills, passes about twenty-five miles south-west and falls into the T\u00e1pti about five miles above the town of Bodh\u00e1n. The \u00c1j\u00e1n, from the high N\u00e1nchhal hills, close to the source of the Karjan, with a winding rocky and uneven bed and steep banks, forces its way through the hills, and, joined by many streams from either side, falls into the T\u00e1pti at Magatr\u00e1v about twelve miles above M\u00e1ndvi. The Dudan, rising from the eastern slopes of the same hills, flows south-east through the S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra lowlands and falls into the T\u00e1pti at Umerda about thirty miles above the \u00c1j\u00e1n. Besides these rivers many small streams cross the country especially\nin the north-west most of them dry in the hot months though water is at all times easily found by digging in their beds. Built wells nowhere numerous are found only in the north and north-west. But their want is little felt as most villages are well supplied with water drawn from wells sunk in the beds of streams.\n\nThe R\u00e1jpipla hills, covering about two-thirds of the whole area of the R\u00e1jpipla state, may be roughly divided into three tracts. In the north, a ten mile broad very rugged belt of hilly and thickly wooded country stretching east and west about thirty-six miles on the whole parallel to the Narbada; in the south, a belt of low flat-topped sloping hills running north and south to the T\u00e1pti and then, along the course of the river, turning east for about twenty miles; in the east, ranges of high hills that fill most of the space between the Narbada and the T\u00e1pti. From the Deva, R\u00e1jpipla's eastern limit, the northern hills, crowded in steep narrow and forest-clad ridges about 2000 feet high, gradually sink westwards, till, breaking into low detached hills, they are lost in the Gujar\u00e1t plain. In the east the hill scenery along the south bank of the Narbada from Sarb\u00e1n about ten miles west to Gora, is very beautiful. And looking east and south from one of the hill tops, with bold quaintly-cut outlines, range stretches behind range, their steep green tree-covered sides furrowed with torrents. The southern hilly tract includes two main lines that together form one crescent-shaped range, a western part running north and south fifteen miles from the valley of the Kim to the valley of the Vari, and a southern part stretching twenty miles east along the T\u00e1pti from the Vari to the Dudan. Standing out from the valley of the Kim, in small detached hills and with slopes gentle enough for carts, the western hills rise about 800 feet in a tame unbroken line, whose broad flat top slopes slowly to the Mohan valley. The southern range, stretching with gently waving outline from the Vari to the Dudan, is, near the middle, cut through by the \u00c1j\u00e1n river. From the south its slopes, passable by carts almost to the top, rise about 1200 feet ending in a thickly wooded plateau but little higher than the northern N\u00e1nchhal uplands. The lines and blocks of hills that in the east, except in the valley of the Dudan in the extreme south-east, stretch from the Narbada to the T\u00e1pti, are highest to the north of S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra, where peaks and rugged ridges rise far above the level of the other R\u00e1jpipla hills.\n\nThe climate, though unhealthy, is pleasant, cold and bracing in the winter months, and with cool nights even in the hot season. Of the climate in 1821 Mr. Willoughby wrote: It is very unhealthy and specially fatal to strangers. The unhealthiness is due chiefly to the water, tainted and in some cases poisoned, by the malarious tracts through which the streams pass. Every thing boiled in the Ratanpur water becomes a nasty, dirty yellow, uneatable, except to the very hungry. The unhealthiness of the climate is shewn in the meagre salowness of the people and the dropsical look of strangers.\u00b9 Of his experience while surveying, in the four\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 268.\nseasons ending 1855, Mr. Pollexfen has left the following details. In the first year about a month in December and January was passed without bad results either to myself or my establishment. Next year beginning work in the same place on the 1st December, by the 13th, myself, twenty-two of my establishment, and three-fourths of my servants, in spite of free use of quinine were so fever-stricken, that, we had to return to Broach. Two men died, and few shook off the fever for a year. Next season in forest parts work was not begun till February. And from then up to the middle of May, there was not a single case of fever. In the next year, though care was again taken not to begin till February, and though the people of the district seemed free from the disease, of seventy-five souls in my camp not ten escaped fever. In Mr. Pollexfen's opinion the district varied much in unhealthiness, S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra and the banks of the T\u00e1pti being much more feverish than the north. The chief source of disease seemed to be the water charged with vegetable matter gathered in passing through the thick close forests and brushwood. Though clear while flowing, if allowed to stand, a thick oily scum rose to the top. Even the natives disliked drinking it, unless it had filtered through a bed of sand. During the years of survey small-pox and cholera were committing fearful ravages among the people.\n\nExcept in the rich western lands the whole of R\u00e1jpipla is covered with trees. The northern forests though full of teak, blackwood, and kher, are so damaged by yearly fires and are in so difficult a country, that, except near the Narbada, their timber is in little demand. In the central uplands good trees are rare. But in the south, especially in S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra, there are valuable teak forests, whose timber is in great demand among the traders of Surat, Anklesvar, and Broach.\n\nA census taken between 1853 and 1855 showed a total population of 108,812 souls. For census purposes the state was divided into three parts, the rich villages in the north, the poorer open lands in the west, and the wild central hill tracts. The seven rich sub-divisions bordering on the Narbada, with an area of 284\u00b73 square miles, had, including the town of N\u00e1ndod with 9500 inhabitants, an estimated population of 78,771 souls or 277\u00b73 to the square mile. The open western districts of Ratanpur and Luna, with an area of 172 square miles, had a population of 10,920 souls or 63\u00b74 to the square mile. The hilly tracts with an area of about 1360 miles had, as nearly as could be ascertained, a population of 19,121 souls or on an average 14 to the square mile.\u00b9 The 1872 census showed a total population of 120,036 souls or 79\u00b726 to the square mile, an increase in seventeen years of 11,224 souls or 10\u00b731 per cent. Of the whole number 114,625 or 95\u00b749 per cent were Hindus; 5257 or 4\u00b738 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns; and 147 or 0\u00b712 per cent P\u00e1rsis. There were five Christians. Of the Hindus, 4360 were classed as\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 319.\nBrahmins; 5803 as Kshatris, Rajputs; 2732 as Vaishas, traders and merchants; 30,145 as Shudras, cultivators, craftsmen, labourers, and depressed classes; and 71,585 as unsettled classes including 62,163 Bhils, 9261 Dhankas, 41 Naikdas, 1 Valvi, and 119 Chodhras. Of 114,625 Hindus, 15,974 were Vaishnavs, 2261 of them Virvaishnavs, 11,208 Ramanujas, 855 Svaninatravans, and 1650 Kabirpanthis; 8594 were Shaivs; 107 Shravaks; 373 Ascetics; and 89,577 goddess worshippers belonging to no special sect. Of the 5257 Musalmans, 5081 were Sunnis, 163 of them Syeds, 548 Shaikhs, 464 Pathans, 8 Moghals, 2 Memans, 151 Bohoras, 44 Afghans, 151 Arabs, 129 Baluchis, 63 Makranis, and 3358 others. There were 176 Shiias all of them Bohoras. Of the Parsis 104 were Shahansha and 43 Kadmis. The five Christians were Roman Catholics. There were 591 villages or one village to about every two square miles. Of these 435 had less than 200 inhabitants; 104 from 200 to 500; 37 from 500 to 1000; 12 from 1000 to 2000; 2 from 2000 to 3000; and one, the town of Nandod, had about 9500 inhabitants.\n\nIn the rich alluvial soil in the north and north-west and in favoured patches in the west, tuver, castor-oil, millet both bajri and juvar, cotton, gram, sugarcane, rice, and to a smaller extent hemp, wheat, and tobacco are grown. Among the hills and forests where Bhils are the only husbandmen, the chief crops are tuver, coarse rice, kodra, banti, and bawta. The four last, in grain almost as small as mustard seed, are the Bhi's chief diet, though unless three or four times washed the kodra is slightly poisonous, causing giddiness and faintness. Few condiments or vegetables are grown and most of the tobacco and molasses is imported. Except that there is almost no irrigation the style of tillage in the rich western districts is much the same as in central Gujar\u00e1t. Almost all the hill crops are grown in chance forest clearings. On these the\n\n---\n\n1 Including the town of Nandod, there were, in 1855, 550 Rajpipla villages. Of these four, Avidha with 735 houses, Panetha with 600, Bhalod with 500, and Jhaghadia with 300, were places of some size, and in the rich Narbada districts there were from fifteen to twenty large villages. The rest were Bhil hamlets of rarely more than twenty huts, clustered together in the plains but in the hills spread over an area of three or four square miles. There were 23,956 houses and 22,245 enclosures, giving an average of 19\u00b746 houses and 18\u00b770 enclosures, to the square mile, and an average population of 5\u00b701 persons to each house, and 5\u00b739 to each enclosure. Of the houses 1711 inhabited by 8194 persons were of the better, and 22,245 with 111,842 inhabitants of the poorer sort. In 1855, in the richer sub-divisions along the Narbada, the people were chiefly Kanbis, Kolis, Rajputs, and Vaniyas with only a few Bhils. In the open western districts of Ratnapur and Luna about half the villages had a mixed population of Kanbis, Kolis, Rajputs and Bohoras; the other half were Bhil villages. The population of the hilly tracts was entirely Bhil. The people of the richer Narbada villages differed little from those of other parts of central Gujar\u00e1t. The Bhils of the hill tracts were of middle size, clean limbed, and muscular, wonderfully active and very clever woodcutters. They were quiet and harmless, patient and easily managed. 'I had always thought of a Bhil,' says Mr. Pollexfen, 'as a lawless marauder, but I have found them very different. Nothing was ever stolen from my camp, and, in some cases, things left behind were found and returned. Their only vice is their fondness for liquor. Their religion is a religion of fear. Nearly every hamlet has some hill dedicated to its special god, who is duly propitiated with offerings. An epidemic is thought to show that the god is angry and to please him, the village site is generally changed. Their marriages cost them large sums plunging them in debt to money-lenders and liquor-sellers. The Dhankas found chiefly in the Gora sub-division on the Narbada in the north-east seem to be closely allied to the Naikdas.'\ntimber is cut and burnt, and the soil, enriched with the ashes and loosened with a pick-axe, yields crops for two years and is then left for some fresh clearing.\n\nFrom N\u00e1ndod, the capital of the state, a road crossing the Narbada at Ch\u00e1nod, passes north to Broach; a second very difficult, scarcely passable to carts, but much used by Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s and probably leading to Mandlesar, passes east to Sulp\u00e1n; a third made about 1850, the only cart-road through the northern hills, runs south to join the Kh\u00e1ndesh route, and a fourth goes west to Broach. In the south are several lines of traffic, unmade cross country cart tracts from Broach, Anklesvar, Surat, Bodh\u00e1n, and M\u00e1ndvi centering at Chitald\u00e1r about thirty miles north-east of M\u00e1ndvi, and then passing east to Kukarmunda eighty-nine miles from Broach and beyond that into Kh\u00e1ndesh. Besides these through routes, near the T\u00e1pti, timber tracks run into the heart of the hills, used by carts though very steep, narrow and difficult.\n\nAlong the main route by Kukarmunda passes a heavy through traffic between Gujar\u00e1t and Kh\u00e1ndesh. The carriers and traders are Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s and Ch\u00e1rans. The Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s bring Kh\u00e1ndesh grain chiefly wheat, and take tobacco and salt, and as they pass do a little business with the Bhils. Along the same route Ch\u00e1rans pass from K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r to Kh\u00e1ndesh with Cutch alum and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1rred earth used in dyeing. They take bullocks with them for sale and occasionally do some trading with the R\u00e1jpipla Bhils. Of local traffic there are two chief branches, a field produce trade from the rich Narbada districts, and a timber trade from the hilly tracts in the south and east. In the north rice and pulse, tuver, are sent in considerable quantities to Broach and wheat is brought back. S\u00e1mbar hides raw and cured, hemp raw woven and made into tape for cots, p\u00f3ti, and turmeric, are exported; and in their stead longcloth, chintz, iron, blankets, sugar, spices and salt are brought back. The trade of these rich northern districts is chiefly in the hands of N\u00e1ndod V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s. These men, once revenue contractors, iy\u00e1rd\u00e1s, and owning considerable capital, have the cultivators, especially the Bhils, very much in their power. Their money and grain advances are, at harvest time, paid back either in coin or kind with very heavy interest leaving the Bhil nearly destitute. To them also the Kanbis dispose of their grain getting money to pay their rents. Another set of traders are travelling pedlars who early in the fair season come in numbers to the hill districts, bartering with the Bhils, taking rice and pulse and giving cloth, tobacco, molasses, salt, and salt fish. A third set are the liquor-sellers almost all Anklesvar P\u00e1rsis, who giving liquor and advancing money for rents get large quantities of grain and butter. But the chief trade of the district is in timber especially in teak from the S\u00e1g\u00e1b\u00e1ra and other southern forests. About November, traders come in great numbers. Bringing carts from Broach, Surat, and Anklesvar, and staying in the forests till June, they hire Bhils to fell and strip trees and load them into\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 318.\ncarts. On the spot the price of a ready filled cart-load of two to six logs varies from 3s. to 4s. (Rs. 1\u00bd - 2), the traders having to pay in tolls a further sum of 6s. to 8s. (Rs. 3 - 4) a cart-load. Besides heavy timber, teak rafters and bamboos at 100 for 2s. (Re. 1) are exported in immense quantities. The profits on the timber trade are very great. In Surat and other centres, bamboos sell at ten times the price paid for them in the R\u00e1jpipla forests.\n\nIron of good quality used to be made at Pardv\u00e1nia near Ratanpur. In 1855, though the manufacture had for many years been given up, N\u00e1ndod had still a good name for its knives and swords. In the richer districts the Dheds wove coarse cloth both cotton and linen, and tape for cots, p\u00e1ti. At Dumkhal in the east some of the Bhils make catechu, k\u00e1tha, the thickened kher tree juice that is eaten with betel-leaves, and others in the richer parts earn a little by plaiting baskets and bamboo matting. On the whole the R\u00e1jpipla manufactures are of the rudest and cheapest.\n\nFor administrative purposes the lands of the state are distributed over seven sub-divisions, pargan\u00e1s, R\u00e1jpipla, N\u00e1ndod, Panetha, Bh\u00e1lod, Jhaghadia, Rupnagar, and Thava, each under a commandant, th\u00e1nd\u00e1r, with considerable revenue, police, and magisterial powers.\n\nThe seven sub-divisions of the R\u00e1jpipla state may be brought under four groups. Four along the Narbada, on the whole rich and well-to-do; one in the west open and rather barren; one in the south a rough wooded upland; and one including the hilly tracts and the half independent sub-divisions of S\u00e1g\u00e1b\u00e1ra on the south-east and of V\u00e1di on the south-west. The four Narbada sub-divisions are, beginning with the east, N\u00e1ndod, Panetha, Bh\u00e1lod, and Jhaghadia. Except a small rugged tract on the right bank of the river, N\u00e1ndod, lying between the hills and the Narbada, and watered by the Karjan and other small streams, is the largest and best sub-division in the state. Besides the town of N\u00e1ndod it has 125 villages, some of them as M\u00e1ngrol, Poicha, Shera, Jior, V\u00e1vri, Sisodra, Oli, Varkhad, P\u00e1tma, Rundh, Narkhari, and Nav\u00e1g\u00e1m, are large and flourishing; others, especially the old petty division of Gardeshvar in the east, are little more than Bhil hamlets. Hilly and covered with forests in the east, the centre is rich and well tilled, and the west, formerly known as the Kanth\u00e1l sub-division, is covered with palmyra trees and much broken by the beds of torrents. West of N\u00e1ndod, Panetha with forty-six villages is, like N\u00e1ndod, large and flourishing. The soil is rich, yielding crops of tobacco, cotton, maize, and millet. Among its large well-to-do villages the chief are Panetha, Indor, Velug\u00e1m, Navr\u00e1, and Umarva. The other two sub-divisions, Bh\u00e1lod with twenty, and Jhaghadia with eighty-one villages, stretch from the rich Narbada bank to broken and forest-covered land. Rupnagar, with twenty villages, formerly the Luna sub-division, stretching\n\n---\n\n1 There were (1855) chiefly on the main S\u00e1g\u00e1b\u00e1ra road twelve tolls, eleven chief tolls, jak\u00e1t, charging from Is. 6d. to 2s. (12 as. - Re. 1) a cart, and the twelfth a bar, n\u00e1ka, charging 1\u00bdd. (anna 1). Payment at one toll carried the cart through the sub-division. But each sub-division had its own toll. Bom. Gov. Sel., XXIII, 316.\nwest into the open and flat Broach plain, passes in the east into broken and forest-covered tracts half way between the rich Narbada districts and the wild country to the east and south. East of Jhaghadia and Rupnagar come the Thava Panch Mahals, Netrang, Rundha, Thava, B\u00e1rg\u00e1ma, and Kukarda, most of them covered with low detached hills. Netrang with forty-eight villages, stretching from Kanth\u00e1l on the north to the Kim on the south, is in the north hilly and in other parts flat and covered with thick forests. The villages are nothing but small hamlets of Bhil huts with patches of tillage near them. Rundha with twenty-eight villages is almost all taken up by a chain of hills sloping gently to the west and ending in a broad table land. Except a few fields fringing each small Bhil hamlet, most of the country is covered with forest and brushwood. Thava with thirty villages has many small hills. Near the Karjan it is fairly well tilled but does not yield half what it would if properly peopled. Thava, in the time of Akbar, the chief town of the sub-division, and from its ruins evidently once a place of some consequence, is now entirely deserted. B\u00e1rg\u00e1ma to the south-east, with twenty-one villages, is almost entirely covered with low hills that slope north to the Karjan. Except near villages the whole is thick forest. Kukarda to the east with sixteen villages is, except in the east, flat and covered with trees. Tillage is only in patches round the little hamlets. The five 'Hill Districts' G\u00e1jargota with thirty-one villages, R\u00e1jb\u00e1ra with eighteen, Dumkhal with twelve, and in the south Nav\u00e1g\u00e1m with seven, and Morjari with twenty are all in the north group of hills. The country is throughout wild and inaccessible, a mass of hills and forest with a few scattered Bhil huts. The th\u00e1nd\u00e1r of these districts is stationed at R\u00e1jpipla. There remain two half-independent Bhil estates S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra in the south-east, and V\u00e1di in the south-west. S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra with about twenty villages, about seventeen miles long and eight broad, the only part of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha that passes as far south as the T\u00e1pti, is under the sway of a Bhil chief D\u00e1mji Vas\u00e1va. Like S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra several other small Bhil estates such as K\u00e1thi, Bhod\u00e1val, Gov\u00e1li, and Chikhli were originally under R\u00e1jpipla. But during the time of the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r's oppression (1786) they would seem to have freed themselves, and in 1817, when British authority was established in Kh\u00e1ndesh, they claimed and received protection from the Kh\u00e1ndesh political officers. In settling R\u00e1jpipla in 1822 Mr. Willoughby established an outpost at S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra. But from the chief's influence over the Bhil population, R\u00e1jpipla authority has never been more than nominal. The people, almost all Bhils, live chiefly by wood-cutting. S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra, the chief's head-quarters, is only a small village of a few grass huts lying under a hill 600 feet high. V\u00e1di, in the south-west corner of R\u00e1jpipla, is a small estate of seven Bhil hamlets, the people almost entirely supported by gathering and selling forest produce. It is at present under direct management and in 1878-79 yielded a revenue of about \u00a3453 (Rs. 4530).\n\n---\n\n1 How much further east R\u00e1jpipla limits formerly stretched appears from Mr. Willoughby's statement (1821) that the eastern limit was 50 miles (33 kos) beyond N\u00e1ndod. The limit is now only 20 miles (13 kos).\nOf ancient R\u00e1jpipla history no details have been obtained, and except that Ratanpur may be Ptolemy's mountain of agates, none of its settlements show traces of any great age.\\(^1\\) Of its two divisions the plain and the hill tracts, it seems probable that the rich lands along the Narbada and the open western districts were included in the domains of the Anhilv\u00e1da kings, and at the close of the thirteenth century were overrun\\(^2\\) by Ala-ud-din Khilji's generals (1295-1315).\\(^3\\) At that time, as appears from an inscription on the image of Rikhavdev in the village of Limodra, the chiefs were Rajputs.\\(^4\\) Early in the fourteenth century the ruling chief is said to have given his daughter in marriage to Mokhd\u00e1ji Gohil,\\(^5\\) the lord of Piram in the Cambay Gulf. In 1347, on the fall of Piram and death of Mokhd\u00e1ji, his son Samarsi retired to Bhagva in the Olpad sub-division of Surat, and, according to the common story, on the death of his maternal grandfather succeeded to the chieftship of R\u00e1jpipla.\\(^6\\) During the rest of the fourteenth century the R\u00e1jpipla chief was left unmolested.\n\nThe establishment (1390) of a strong Musalm\u00e1n dynasty in Gujar\u00e1t put an end to this independence. Defeated and humbled by Sult\u00e1n Muhammad I. in 1403, and in 1416 foiled in a scheme of revolt,\\(^7\\) he was, in 1431, attacked by Sult\u00e1n Ahmad, and his town of N\u00e1ndod\\(^8\\) destroyed. Driven from his lands the chief Harising is said to have remained twelve years an outlaw, and then to have been restored to his rights.\\(^9\\) During the next 150 years the R\u00e1jpipla chief is seldom mentioned\\(^10\\) and would seem to have held a very independent position, serving the state with 3000 horse and 1000 foot,\\(^11\\) but paying no tribute. At the same time this independent territory\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The account given in Arrian's Periplus (about A.D. 247) of the trade routes from Broach to Paithan, Plith\u00e1na, and Juvanar, Tagara, in the Deccan, mentions that the way passes through a great space of wild and desert country, and large mountains in which are leopards, tigers, elephants, vast serpents, hyenas, and baboons. Vincent's Commerce of the Ancients, II. 411. It seems possible as so many of Ptolemy's names are places of pilgrimage that the Sarban (Map X.) on the Mahi just as it leaves the hills, is Sarban on the Narbada.\n\n\\(^2\\) Mr. Willoughby (1821) states that in 1296 an army was several times sent against R\u00e1jpipla, but the R\u00e1ja, being powerful in troops and money it did not prevail against him. They however obtained a footing at N\u00e1ndod, built a mosque, caused the kutha to be read and coined money. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 264. This does not agree with the account given by Musalm\u00e1n historians, according to whom the R\u00e1ja of R\u00e1jpipla remained independent till the time of Sult\u00e1n Muhammad I. (1403).\n\n\\(^3\\) According to local story they were Parm\u00e1rs of the house of Ujain. Bom.Gov.Sel.

They took it from Khervu, its Bhil chief, and after holding it for about twenty generations were expelled by the R\u00e1thods, at the end of the 12th century. R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 104.\n\n\\(^5\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 264. According to the R\u00e1jpipla chiefs' genealogical tree, the chiefs stayed at Bhagva during two generations and extended their sway over Olpad and Anklesvar. But this tree was only lately (about 1850) drawn up, and is said not to be a trustworthy guide. Bom. Gov. Sel.

This arrangement continued after the transfer of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t to the Moghal Emperors. In 1590, according to the \u00c1in-i-Akbari 'N\u00e1dant' with twelve sub-divisions, some to the south and others to the north of the Narbada, was a regular part of the Imperial domain, showing under Todar Mal's survey an area of 270,908 acres (5,41,817 bigh\u00e1s), and yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a321,994 (87,97,596 d\u00e1m\u00e1s). Separate from N\u00e1dant was the R\u00e1jpipla state, a hilly country, seventy-five miles by fifty-five, (50 kos by 40) and therefore stretching far into western Kh\u00e1ndesh, entirely under the management of a Br\u00e1hman. The chief whose power was only nominal, was a Gohil who lived sometimes in R\u00e1jpipla and sometimes in Ghulva, a place of bad water but rich in honey and rice. The chief had 3000 cavalry and 7000 infantry. It does not seem clear what terms Akbar made with the R\u00e1jpipla chief. Neither at the first (1572) nor at the second (1573) settlement is he mentioned. But in 1576 troops had to be stationed at N\u00e1ndod to keep him in order and in the following years (1583-1592) by three times giving a hiding place to the rebel prince, Muzaffar, the R\u00e1jpipla chief must have incurred the Emperor's severe displeasure. According to one account Akbar changed the condition of service into a tribute of \u00a33555 12s. (Rs. 35,556). But this seems doubtful both from what is stated in the \u00c1in-i-Akbari and from the fact that in 1609 when a post was established at R\u00e1mnagar, the R\u00e1jpipla chief furnished a contingent of 1000 men.\n\n---\n\n1 Bird's Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 111. One reason why R\u00e1jpipla and its chief are so seldom mentioned in Ahmedabad histories may be that they are spoken of under the name of R\u00e1ja of P\u00e1l (Watson, 54, note 1). P\u00e1l, probably derived from p\u00e1l\u00f3, leaves, and so meaning forest lands, seems to be used pretty generally for the wild hill and forest tracts of eastern Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, and in this R\u00e1jpipla may sometimes be included. But the territory of the chief, oftenest mentioned as the R\u00e1ja of P\u00e1l, seems to have been much further north (Watson, 47-49; Bird, 285 and note) and was probably either B\u00e1r\u00edya, which is still known as B\u00e1r\u00edya P\u00e1l, (Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 151), or some tract near it. According to the \u00c1in-i-Akbari (Gladwin, II. 72), P\u00e1l was a territory between Dungarpur and Bans\u00e9v\u00e1da near Meran and Mangrih through which the Mahi ran.\n\n2 The sub-divisions were, according to Gladwin (II. 239), Amroli, Avdha, Besroy, Badal, Tilkov\u00e1reh, Tevha, Jemug\u00e1m, Kyar, Murghedereh, Manden, N\u00e1dant and Nutrung. Of these Amroli is probably the place of the same name in the Sankhedha Mehv\u00e1s; Avdha seems to be Avdha or Arudah, also called Varita (Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 265), another name for Bh\u00e1lod in the north-west near the Narbada, mentioned (1855) as having a mosque and outpost. (Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 296); Besroy has not been traced; Bedal is perhaps Bud\u00e1val (Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 296); Tilkov\u00e1reh is Talakv\u00e1da on the Narbada; Tevha is Thava, one of the southern sub-divisions, 'the town deserted but with ruins'; Jemug\u00e1m is J\u00e1mbug\u00e1m, another name for Luna in the west (Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 296). Neither Kyar nor Murghedereh has been identified; Manden is perhaps M\u00e1ndal in V\u00e1sr\u00e1v; N\u00e1dant is N\u00e1ndod; and Nutrung is Netrang in the south of Ratanpur.\n\n3 Ghulva is probably G\u00e9v\u00e1li near S\u00e1g\u00e1b\u00e1ra on the high road to Kh\u00e1ndesh, not the Gov\u00e1li in the west on the Narbada. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 325.\n\n4 Gladwin's \u00c1in-i-Akbari, II. 73.\n\n5 At the time of Akbar's settlement Jayasing was the chief of R\u00e1jpipla, R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 299.\n\n6 Bird's Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 343.\n\n7 Bird's Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 353-375; Blochmann, 335; Watson, 64, 65.\n\n8 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 265.\n\n9 Watson's History, 68.\nDuring the rest of the seventeenth century, either by service or by the occasional payment of tribute, the chief continued to acknowledge his dependence.\n\nAs late as 1715 mention is made of the grant of the district of N\u00e1ndod to Haidar Kuli Kh\u00e1n.\\(^1\\) Between this date and 1754 the R\u00e1jpipla chief seems to have recovered from the Moghals almost the whole of the N\u00e1ndod district. In this attempt to increase his power he found a dangerous rival in Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, who, in 1723, from his castle at Songad, overran south Gujar\u00e1t and built several forts within R\u00e1jpipla limits.\\(^2\\) Later on, in 1763, the Peshwa allowed D\u00e1m\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, whose share of Gujar\u00e1t yielded less than had been expected, to add to his revenues by annexing small Rajput estates and by levying tribute on the larger chiefs. With this object he advanced against R\u00e1jpipla whose chief R\u00e1ising was only a boy of seven, and forced him to give up one-half of the four rich sub-divisions, of N\u00e1ndod, Bh\u00e1lod, Variti, and Gov\u00e1li. Shortly after, D\u00e1m\u00e1ji, on receiving the chief's niece in marriage, agreed, instead of a share in the four sub-divisions, to take a yearly money payment of \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000), keeping at the same time three or four villages near the Narbada and building a mud fort in each of the four sub-divisions.\\(^3\\) Matters remained on this footing till, in 1781, R\u00e1ising's minister intriguing with the Baroda Court, Fatehsing G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r with an armed force advanced to N\u00e1ndod and raised the tribute to \u00a34900 (Rs. 49,000). In spite of these exactions R\u00e1jpipla was at this time prosperous. With moderate land rates and cesses the average yearly revenue was \u00a334,558 (Rs. 3,45,580).\\(^4\\) A strong chain of posts with an average strength of about 50 horse and 230 foot kept order over the whole country. Of the posts one of the chief was at S\u00e1g\u00e1b\u00e1ra to protect the Kh\u00e1ndesh trade route, along which passed so considerable a traffic that the dues yielded a yearly revenue of from \u00a34000 to \u00a35000 (Rs. 40,000 - 50,000).\\(^5\\)\n\nIn 1786 R\u00e1ising was succeeded by his brother Ajabsing an imbecile prince, whose feeble rule of over seventeen years (1786-1803) was most disastrous to R\u00e1jpipla. Taking advantage of Ajabsing's weakness the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, on R\u00e1ising's death (1786), raised the tribute to \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000) to be paid every second year, and again in 1793 increased the amount to \u00a37800 (Rs. 78,000). At the same time Umed Vas\u00e1va, the Bhil chief of S\u00e1g\u00e1b\u00e1ra revolted, and with the aid of a large body of Arab and Sindian mercenaries\\(^6\\) held five of the hill districts, and stopping all traffic along the Kh\u00e1ndesh route reduced R\u00e1jpipla revenues from about \u00a334,558 to \u00a325,940. Quarrelling with his father, R\u00e1msing the son of Ajabsing retired to the petty state of M\u00e1ndva to the north of the Narbada. Helped by the chief, he raised some troops and attacked R\u00e1jpipla, but was defeated and forced to fly to M\u00e1ndva. Here he married the chief's daughter,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Watson's History, 91.\n\\(^2\\) Watson's History, 97.\n\\(^3\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII, 265.\n\\(^4\\) Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII, 280.\n\\(^5\\) Bom.

XXIII, 281, 273.\nand afterwards returning to R\u00e1jpipla on a promise of pardon, was seized and imprisoned, and Narsing his younger brother was named as the heir. On Ajabsing's death in 1803, the troops, refusing to accept the younger brother, raised R\u00e1msing to the chiefship. On succeeding to power R\u00e1msing gave himself up to debauchery, and, seldom free from the effects of intoxicating drugs, left to his minister the whole management of the state. Taking advantage of his weakness the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r in 1805 sent a force to R\u00e1jpipla, extorted a succession fee, nazar\u00e1na, of \u00a315,000 (Rs. 1,50,000), and raised the tribute to \u00a39600 (Rs. 96,000), adding shortly afterwards a further yearly demand of \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000). In 1810 the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, with the consent of the British Government, deposed R\u00e1msing, choosing as his successor Prat\u00e1psing, R\u00e1msing's supposed child by the M\u00e1ndva chief's daughter.\u00b9 This succession Narsing, R\u00e1msing's brother, refused to accept, declaring that Prat\u00e1psing was not R\u00e1msing's son, but was the child of a poor M\u00e1ndva Rajput, passed off as her son by R\u00e1msing's wife. In the same year (1810) R\u00e1msing died, and Narsing began to plunder the country. Disorder continued till, in 1813, a six months' truce was followed by the despatch to R\u00e1jpipla of a large G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r force and the conclusion of an agreement, under which, leaving the management of the state in the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's hands, Prat\u00e1psing and Narsing promised to keep the peace for two years and then submit their claims to arbitration.\n\nThe G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, once in possession, made no haste to settle the rival claims, and four years passed before even a preliminary inquiry was made. For this reason and as the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r's officers had entirely failed to establish order, the British Government determined to take upon itself the settlement of the disputed succession. It was at first proposed that the arbitrators should be the R\u00e1ja of Chhota Udepur and other Rewa K\u00e1ntha chiefs. But as all the men of this class were under the influence of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, and as the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r was pledged to uphold Prat\u00e1psing's claim, the settlement of the question was placed (9th June 1820) in the hands of Mr. Willoughby the assistant resident. After very full inquiry Mr. Willoughby decided (20th February 1821) that Prat\u00e1psing was a spurious child and that Narsing was the rightful claimant, and this, with some hesitation the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r admitted. The British Government then assumed the management of R\u00e1jpipla, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r handing over all control on the same terms as he had in 1820 given up the supervision of the tributary states in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and the Mahi K\u00e1ntha.\u00b2 As Narsing was blind his son Veris\u00e1lji, a youth of thirteen was appointed ruler, and on November 15th was installed by Mr. Willoughby in the R\u00e1jpipla fort.\u00b3 In October 1821 he entered into an engagement binding himself and his successors to act in conformity with the advice of the British Government.\u2074\n\n\u00b9 Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 265, 266, XCVIII. The Bombay Government agreed to guarantee this arrangement, but on account of the death of R\u00e1msing the guarantee was not actually affixed to the sanad.\n\u00b2 Bom. Gov. Sel.

The most glaring crimes went unpunished; the hilly tracts continued waste; no effort had been made to open the S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra line of traffic; and the revenue, realized entirely from the rich northern districts had, though with rates raised from 6s. to \u00a32 and from \u00a31 4s. to \u00a35 an acre (Rs. 3 - 20, and Rs. 12 - 50 a kumbha), fallen from \u00a325,016 to \u00a328,796 (Rs. 2,50,160 - 2,37,960).\u00b9\n\nThe resources of the country were almost exhausted. The towns and villages were mostly in ruins, the lands untilled, and the people fled. Those who remained were sunk in debt, their lands mortgaged to money-lenders. \u2018From every side rose the voice of misery.\u2019\u00b2\n\nThe look-out for the next season was most gloomy. Though the 1820 collections had fallen short of \u00a324,000 (Rs. 2,40,000)\u00b3 the contractor had for 1821 engaged to pay a sum of \u00a329,000 (Rs. 2,90,000). Scared by the contractor\u2019s efforts to make good this amount, many of the chief men of each N\u00e1ndod village had run away, placing large b\u00e1bul branches in front of their doors, in token that till better times came they would not return.\u2074\n\nThe British Government interfered in R\u00e1jpipla affairs to ensure that the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s dues were properly paid and that order was established. To gain these objects the British Government had to assume entire control over the state finances, and to undertake the task of reclaiming the wild hill tribes. The first step taken was to obtain from the chief a written agreement (26th November 1823) to limit his expenses; to adopt any plan proposed by the Baroda Resident for meeting the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s debt and tribute demands; to pay any British troops that might be wanted to keep the peace in R\u00e1jpipla; to prevent or make good losses caused by R\u00e1jpipla robbers; to harbour no breakers of the public peace; to refer disputes for settlement to the British Government; to protect travellers; to make his people accept the British settlement of their gir\u00e1s claims in the Broach and Surat districts; and to comply with any arrangements the British Government might propose for the regulation of the opium trade.\u2075 To fix the next year\u2019s revenue demand a return for ten years 1796 to 1800, and 1816 to 1820, was drawn up and the average \u00a322,928 (Rs. 2,29,280) taken.\u2076 Of this not more than \u00a319,500 (Rs. 1,95,000) were realized. The failure was due to a most disastrous flood that in September 1821 swept away entire villages from the banks of the Narbada, destroyed all the early\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel.

So great was the damage that under the former systems the probable revenue for the next year would not have been more than \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). Under these circumstances it was arranged that the seven rich sub-divisions should for seven years be leased to men of capital, who, in the hope of large future gains, would be willing to pay for the first year more than they actually recovered. Care was taken to choose men of good position, to offer them every inducement to favour immigration and bring waste lands under tillage, and, by keeping the police in the chief's hands and making the contractor engage not to levy more than customary rates, to save the cultivators from ill usage.\n\nA sufficient revenue secured, it was decided (20th February 1823) to fix the Gaikw\u00e1r's tribute at a yearly sum of \u00a35672 (Baroda Rs. 65,000). To settle the Gaikw\u00e1r's debt was a much harder task. The amount originally claimed, no less than \u00a3217,624 12s. (Rs. 21,76,246), proved on examination to include upwards of twenty-four per cent interest and an unjust item of \u00a330,000 (Rs. 3,00,000). With very little demur the Gaikw\u00e1r lowered his claim to \u00a392,002 (Rs. 9,20,020). Even then there were many unjust and overcharged items, and, as it was hopeless to expect the Rajpipla state to pay such a sum, the Gaikw\u00e1r agreed, on condition that as much as possible should be paid in ready money and the rest in yearly instalments, to reduce the whole claim to \u00a380,000 (Rs. 8,00,000). Of the \u00a380,000 a sum of \u00a314,033 (Rs. 1,40,330) was disputed by the chief who asserted that the Gaikw\u00e1r's managers had recovered it when Rajpipla was in their hands. The whole admitted debt was thus reduced to about \u00a365,967 (Rs. 6,59,670). Of this in the first year by borrowing \u00a324,402 (Rs. 2,44,020) the sum of \u00a340,569 (Rs. 4,05,690) was paid, leaving \u00a325,398 (Rs. 2,53,980) outstanding. It was estimated that in the next six years the new loan would be discharged and a surplus remain to clear off the rest of the Gaikw\u00e1r debt. Of the \u00a314,033 in dispute between the Rajpipla chief and the Gaikw\u00e1r it was afterwards settled that one-half should be admitted. In 1825 all claims were finally adjusted and it was arranged that the balance due to the Gaikw\u00e1r should be paid in the eight years ending 1833-34.\n\n---\n\n1 Assistant in charge to Government, 3rd July 1823. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 587,588. Details are given in a letter to Government dated 30th November 1822.\n2 Mr. Willoughby to Government, 20th Feb. 1823, and other correspondence ending with Government letter, 15th March 1823. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 587-605.\n3 Of the installation Mr. Willoughby gives these details. After a few religious ceremonies two Kotl\u0101h Bhils, supposed to be the descendants of former rulers, repeating a blessing and performing the rite of chandla, or brow marking, took the young chief in their arms and, stepping on a platform about three feet high, seated him on the state cushion amidst acclamations and distributions of sugar. Letter of 19th Nov. 1821. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 507.\n4 Of \u00a324,402, \u00a322,500 were, under British guarantee, raised from Baroda bankers, and \u00a31902 were borrowed from the Rajpipla state banker, pold\u0101r. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 623.\n5 Mr. Willoughby to Government, 21st June 1823. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 621-628.\nThe second great object of British interference was by some conciliatory settlement to change the disorderly Bhils into peaceable and industrious subjects. Mr. Willoughby's inquiries showed that in Raising's time (1763-1785) before disorder had spread, the Bhils were kept quiet by the establishment all over their districts of strong military posts. Misbehaviour on the part of the Bhils was always severely punished. If a whole village was in fault it was generally attacked and burnt to the ground, and its people of both sexes and every age put to the sword. For Bhils guilty of treason or other heinous crimes the punishment was death by impaling, by burning over a slow fire, by blowing from a gun, and by beheading. Lighter offences were punished by maiming, flogging, imprisonment, or fine. Suspected persons generally confessed choosing punishment rather than face a trial by ordeal. Some of the more powerful Bhil chiefs, on condition of service, held their villages free from any payment, except a small house tax. Again the head, vas\u00e1va, of a Bhil village, on condition of feeding Government officers when on duty, held under the name of valtar, as much rent-free land as his household could till. The village head had also the right to levy a small cess, kunti, on every merchant halting for a night in his village.\n\nIn 1821 Mr. Willoughby's inquiries into the state of the Bhils led him to divide them into two classes, the quiet Bhil of the plain and the unruly hill Bhil. Quiet Bhils were found in Gora, Gardeshvar, and Kanthal in the north-east; in Ratanpur and Jhabug\u00e1m in the west, and in parts of the southern sub-divisions. They were orderly and obedient husbandmen, paying rents either by a bullock or field tool cess. In districts held by Bhils of this class it would, in Mr. Willoughby's opinion, be enough to see that their rights were respected and that they were in no way oppressed; that posts were established strong enough promptly to put down disturbance; that over the whole district, each settlement should, for its good behaviour, furnish the security of its two neighbouring villages; and that the chief Bhil of the sub-division should stand surety for all the villages under him. The hill Bhils could be managed only by strong military posts at S\u00e1gbar\u00e1, Rhocha, and R\u00e1jpipla. The districts were too thinly peopled and the Bhils too unruly to be able to give any useful security.\n\nBesides general measures for quieting the Bhils, special steps had to be taken to bring to order certain chiefs who were either in open revolt or who claimed a half independence. Of these the most important were Kuvar Vas\u00e1va of S\u00e1gbar\u00e1 in the south-east,\n\n---\n\n1 Resident of Baroda, 28th October 1821. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 701.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 726,727.\n3 The rates for every pair of bullocks varied from 16s. to \u00a31 12s.(Rs. 8 - 16), taken half in money, half in rice; the rates on tools were for a hatchet, kulw\u00e1di, 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd); for a pickaxe, kod\u00e1li, 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd), and 2s. 4d. (Rs. 1-2-8) on a sickle, d\u00e1t\u00e1rdi, Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 743,744.\n4 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 728,\n5 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 730.\nRaising of Rhocha in the south-west, and B\u00e1ji D\u00e1ima of Talakv\u00e1da to the north of the Narbada. On the 26th January 1822 Kuvar Vas\u00e1va came and presented himself at Mr. Willoughby's camp. This man, about twenty-six years of age, above the common order of his tribe, and able to write a tolerable hand, was the son of the Umed Vas\u00e1va mentioned above, who, during the rule of Ajabsing (1786-1803), going into rebellion, raised a large force of Sindian and other mercenaries, and, till he was assassinated, kept his hold over five of the hill districts. Before giving himself up in 1822, Kuvar Vas\u00e1va had for some time been quiet, but he was believed to be planning fresh raids, and had still about eighty men under him, half of them Bhils and the rest Sindians and Arabs. On a promise of pardon and of a settlement of his claims, Kuvar agreed to live quietly in S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra as a R\u00e1jpipla subject; to pay customary dues; to obey the orders of the Government commandants; to give up lands to which he had no right; to refer disputes and claims to the settlement of Government; to be responsible for robberies in which he was proved to have had a share; to seize or give information of any bad characters that might hide in his territories; and to entertain no foreign troops. On Kuvar's completing this agreement, it was arranged that the head of his Sindi troops and twenty-five of the men should be employed by the R\u00e1jpipla chief; that a monthly grant of \u00a312 10s. (Rs. 125) should be given to Kuvar's brother, if with twelve Bhils he came and settled in N\u00e1ndbd; and that a post of forty horse and eighty foot should be established at S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra. Of greater power, though much less given to open disorder than the S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra Kuvar, was his father-in-law R\u00e1ising of Rhocha, a chief about fifty years old, very difficult to deal with, fawning and crafty, with 'sweet water in his mouth and black blood in his heart'. R\u00e1ising who was said to be very rich had in his service upwards of fifty men; and though not in outlawry, refused for long to come to the Political Agent's camp. At last he came in, gave up all his troops except eight, and offered security for his good behaviour. The third chief was a Molesal\u00e1m freebooter B\u00e1ji D\u00e1ima who, with two other outlaws, N\u00e1sir Kh\u00e1n and Umed Kh\u00e1n and troops of Dh\u00e1nk\u00e1s 'a cruel and bloodthirsty tribe' of Bhils, living at Talakv\u00e1da on the Narbada, had, as the price of abstaining from plunder, extorted sums of money from many villages in the eastern Narbada districts.\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 714.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 712.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 712.\n4 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 736. The origin of R\u00e1ising's wealth is said to have been in 1809 when, on condition of giving them an asylum in one of his villages, he was paid a large share of the plunder by Bohor\u00e1s who were in hiding after the disturbance at M\u00e1ndvi. He afterwards, on a promise that no inquiry should be made about the plunder, gave up the Bohor\u00e1s, enriching himself, it was said, by about \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000).\n5 Dh\u00e1nka would seem to be another name for N\u00e1ikda.\n6 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 267. Gora (January 1822) was very distressed, many of its villages being in the entire possession of, and the whole greatly harassed by, the Talakv\u00e1da Mehv\u00e1sis (p. 541). Inquiry afterwards showed that B\u00e1ji had a claim on some of the villages to which he had advanced money (p. 745).\nIn November 1823 Mr. Willoughby was sent to make a settlement with B\u00e1ji D\u00e1ima and the two other Talav\u00e1da outlaws. Helped by the ruggedness of their country, and encouraged by former successes against Baroda troops, these chiefs refused to surrender. Very active steps were taken to bring them to order, the supplies were cut off; a Bhil chief was hired to track them; and a reward was offered to any one who would seize them; at the same time they were told through a Bh\u00e1t that if they surrendered, their lives would be spared and their claims settled. Of the three chiefs, N\u00e1sir Kh\u00e1n was the first to come in (December 1823). He was followed after about eight months (7th July 1824) by Umed Kh\u00e1n, and he about a month later by B\u00e1ji D\u00e1ima. On surrendering, the chiefs agreed to behave as peaceable subjects, to pay revenue, to accept the Government settlement of their claims, to harbour no outlaws, to remain in Baroda for five years, and to give security for their good behaviour. Two other Bhil chiefs Kuvar Jiva and K\u00e1lia Cham\u00e1r from the Kh\u00e1ndesh frontier are mentioned as coming in (January 1824), and signing agreements for good behaviour. Between 1821 and 1827, though the Political Agent exercised only a general supervision, R\u00e1jpipla had much improved. Order was kept and from Broach and Baroda complaints of R\u00e1jpipla raids had ceased. The country was on the whole well and mildly managed, and the revenues, in spite of one year of flood and two of drought, had, during the five years ending 1827, risen from \u00a315,661 to \u00a325,948.\n\nFor four years after 1827, British supervision was relaxed and the management of the finances left to the chief and his minister. The result was a drop in the revenue from \u00a325,948 to \u00a317,636 2s. (Rs. 2,59,480 - 1,76,361). An inquiry into the cause of this decrease showed that large amounts had been embezzled. On this Government had again to interfere, and letting out the districts in farm for seven years realized an average revenue of \u00a322,463 6s. (Rs. 2,24,633). At the close of this farm, the entire management of the finances was again handed over to the chief, and again the revenue returns fell, the average of the nine years ending 1848-49 being only \u00a320,659 (Rs. 2,06,590). An inquiry showed that the actual revenue was considerably greater than that entered in the state accounts. Pressure was put on the chief to settle the claims for which the British Government had given its guarantee. And in 1850, when this was done, Government finally withdrew its supervision. In 1852 an engagement was mediated by the British Government between the G\u00e1lkw\u00e1r and the R\u00e1ja of R\u00e1jpipla; by which some old disputes were\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 771.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 775.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 747.\n4 Crimes though still committed were much less general and much surer of detection, and daily over the whole district large numbers of people were flocking back. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 730,731.\n5 In 1825 Mr. Romer the Agent to the Governor in Surat complained that the M\u00e1ndvi chief had suffered much from R\u00e1jpipla robbers. But the people who were to blame would seem to have been the V\u00e1sr\u00e1vi Bhils. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 780.\n6 The details were: 1823, \u00a315,661; 1824, \u00a319,915; 1825, 19,986; 1826, \u00a324,336; and 1827, \u00a325,948, Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII, 843.\nsettled by the transfer of certain villages in which both governments had shares to the Gaikwar and the Raja respectively, and the admission of the right of the Raja of Rajpipla to collect certain customs on payment of \u00a31165 (Baroda Rs. 13,351) yearly.\n\nA few years later at the time of survey (1852-1855), the district, though backward, thinly peopled, and suffering from an ill-managed system of revenue leases, was much richer and more prosperous than fifty years before. Order was well established and cases of crime were few. Most of the Bhils were quiet and well behaved. Nandod had become a prosperous town of 20,000 inhabitants, with well built high houses, a manufacture and export of great numbers of quaintly shaped well tempered knives, and a considerable trade chiefly in forest produce, honey, bees' wax, sambhar hides, and bamboos. The hill tracts in the centre and east were still covered with thick forest and had very few people and very little cultivation, and the southern and south-western districts had still large forest tracts broken by patches of tillage. But near the Kim the land was well tilled, and all along the Narbada it was rich and prosperous.\n\nAbout the middle of August 1857, the chief prayed the Government to help him, stating that he had found a certain Syed Morad Ali tampering with his troops and trying to organize a disturbance in Nandod. On receipt of this message (August 17) Mr. Rogers, the Collector of Broach, taking with him 200 men of the 1st Grenadiers and a detachment of 50 Europeans from the 83rd Queen's, then detained at Broach by stress of weather, started for Nandod. Hearing of their approach Morad Ali fled, and the risk of an outbreak was at an end. A detachment of 200 men was left at Nandod, and till the mutinies were over Rajpipla gave no further cause for uneasiness. On the 20th January 1859, Government decided that Rajpipla should pay a yearly sum of \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) towards the maintenance of this force called the Gujarat Bhil Corps. This was subsequently converted into a police corps, and as no part of it was employed in Rajpipla, the Raja on the 1st May 1865 was freed from any demand on its account. If however the troops are employed in Rajpipla, the chief is liable to such contribution as Government may think fit and reasonable.\n\nIn 1859 Kuvar Vasava of Sagbara, who had been blind for some years, died, leaving two sons Lashkario who had managed the estate and a younger son Dungario. Shortly after, Damji the son of Dungario, imprisoned his uncle Lashkario and in spite of the orders of the chief and of the Political Agent, declared himself head of the clan. He held his position till in 1860 troops were sent against him.\n\n---\n\n1 Aitchison's Treaties (1876) IV, 270-273, CII.\n2 The leaseholders had in some cases been guilty of so great an extortion that the people had deserted their villages. In consequence of this the chief refused to renew the leases, and, when they fell in, managed the villages through his own officers. Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 300-313.\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel.

After this Lashkario formally resigned the chiefship, and the heads of the neighbouring clans agreed in choosing D\u00e1mji. The relations between D\u00e1mji and the R\u00e1jpipla chief then came under discussion. In the end it was settled that, while admitting that the R\u00e1jpipla chief was his superior and had the right to levy customs, D\u00e1mji should have the revenue and police management of his estate. The neighbouring Bhil chiefs became answerable for D\u00e1mji's good behaviour, and matters have since gone smoothly. In 1860, with the permission of Government, Veris\u00e1lji abdicated and his only son Gambhirisingji, the present ruling chief, was on the 17th November duly installed by the Political Agent. Though he had nominally retired, Veris\u00e1lji as his son's minister, kept in his own hands all the power of the state. Gambhirisingji, as he grew up, chafed against this arrangement, and ill feeling rose to such a pitch, that in 1867 Government had to interfere. Veris\u00e1lji was forced to forego all interference in state affairs and in the following year died.\n\nOn the 16th June 1871 a slight disturbance broke out in the Bhil district of V\u00e1di in the south-west of R\u00e1jpipla. Umed, the chief of V\u00e1di, some time before his death entrusted the estate to Narsai, one of his younger sons. On Umed's death, his eldest son K\u00e1g\u00fa claimed the chiefship; and as the dispute threatened to become serious and the R\u00e1jpipla chief was unable to settle it, the Political Agent interfered, taking the estate under his direct supervision. Shortly after, Narsai the younger claimant, at the head of an armed force, made a sudden night attack on his brother's house and the Government officer in charge. He was ultimately seized and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment, and the estate is still under the control of the British Government.\n\nThe following table shows the chief members of the R\u00e1jpipla family for the last century:\n\n```\nJitsing\u00b9 (died 1754).\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Prat\u00e1psing (died 1764).\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 R\u00e1sing (died 1786).\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 R\u00e1msing (deposed 1810).\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Ajabsing (died 1803).\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Narsing (abdicated 1821).\n\u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 Veris\u00e1lji (abdicated 1860).\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Gambhirisingji\n```\n\n\u00b9 The family bards make Jitsing the forty-first descendant of Sh\u00e1liv\u00e1han.

He is the only Rewa K\u00e1ntha chief with first class jurisdiction, that is with power to try for capital offences all persons but British subjects. He is entitled to a salute of eleven guns and to a native guard of honour of inferior strength. The present chief, Gambhirsingji, born in 1846, is now (1879) in his 34th year. Though opposed to change he has of late years considerably improved his police; he has built schools, a dispensary, and a jail, and is now spending \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000) on a road from N\u00e1ndod 34\u00bd miles to Anklesvar station.\n\nChhota Udepur, in point of size the second of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha states, lies between north latitude 22\u00b0 2' and 22\u00b0 32', and east longitude 73\u00b0 47' and 74\u00b0 20', and has a total area of 820 square miles, a population of 62,913 souls or 76\u00b772 to the square mile, and, for the five years ending 1878, an average yearly revenue of \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000).\n\nIt is bounded on the north by the B\u00e1riya state, on the east by Ali R\u00e1jpur in Central India, on the south by the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s estates of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha, and on the west by Baroda.\n\nThe district is irregular in shape and for the most part covered with hills and forests.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Or or Orsang, which, flowing through the lands of Sursi, Jetpur, Jhabug\u00e1m, and R\u00e1j V\u00e1sna, by the towns of Udepur and Jhabug\u00e1m, joins the Narbada between Ch\u00e1nod and Karn\u00e1l\u00ed; the Heran, flowing through the P\u00e1nvad sub-division, and joining the Or in the Gaikw\u00e1r's territory to the west of the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s; and the Narbada, which forms for about fifteen miles the south-eastern boundary of the state. Besides these there are the Bh\u00e1laj, flowing through Tejgad, and Jetpur, and joining the Or; the Ani flowing through Tejgad; the B\u00e1mi through P\u00e1nvad; the Kara through Kav\u00e1nt, and the Boch through R\u00e1j V\u00e1sna.\n\nMost of Chhota Udepur is covered with hills. In Tejgad near the centre along the Or valley, though rugged in outline, they are of no great height. In the south-east a range of hills runs north-east and south-west through P\u00e1nvad, and further south towards the Narbada, the whole of Kav\u00e1nt is covered with high rugged hills. At the back of Karn\u00e1l\u00ed, noticeable for miles round, a flat-topped trap ridge stretching east and west for four miles, rises at its western end into two sharply marked peaks. Its top, a broad table-land, yields crops of millet and pulse. In Targol, in the north-west about ten miles south-east of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad, rises the Jhund hill, once a favourite place of refuge for outlaws, and still, from the thickness of its woods, most difficult of approach.\n\nDuring the greater part of the year the climate is damp, unhealthy, and feverish.\n\nGrain, pulse, and timber, are the chief produce of the state. The principal articles of traffic are timber and the flowers of the mahuda tree, Bassia latifolia.\nThe 1872 census showed a population of 62,913 souls, or 76\u00b772 to the square mile. Of the whole number, 61,381 or 97\u00b756 per cent were Hindus, 1515 or 2\u00b741 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, and 17 P\u00e1rs\u00eds. Of the Hindus 276 were classed as Br\u00e1hmans; 2407 as Kshatris, Rajputs; 1086 as Vaishas, traders and merchants; 2974 as Shudras, cultivators, craftsmen, labourers, and depressed classes; and 54,638 unsettled classes including 37,682 Kolis, 1978 Bhils, 9594 Dh\u00e1nk\u00e1s, 5377 N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s, and 7 Dumd\u00e1s. Of 61,381 the total Hindu population, six were Vir Vaishnavs, 2675 R\u00e1m\u00e1nujs, 733 Vallabh\u00e1charis, and 340 Kabirpanthis; 506 were Shaivs, 33 ascetics, and 57,088 unsectarian Hindus. Of the Musalm\u00e1ns 21 were Syeds, 281 Shaikhs, 79 Path\u00e1ns, 65 Bohor\u00e1s, 50 Arabs, 191 Makr\u00e1nis, and 828 were entered as \u2018Others\u2019. Of the whole number 1460 were Sunnis and 55 Shi\u00e1s. Of the P\u00e1rs\u00eds 13 were Shahansh\u00e1is and 4 Kadmis. The number of villages was 530 or 0\u00b764 to the square mile; the average village population 118\u00b770 souls. Of the whole number, 465 villages had less than 200 inhabitants; 57 had from 200 to 500; 4 from 500 to 1000; 3 from 1000 to 2000; and one, the town of Udepur, between 2000 and 3000. There were 14,506 houses, or, an average of 17\u00b769 houses to the square mile, and 4\u00b733 persons to each house. Of the total number of houses, 184 inhabited by 867 persons were of the better, and 14,322 with 62,046 inhabitants, of the poorer, sort.\n\nChhota Udepur contains ten sub-divisions, pargan\u00e1s, Sursi or Dor, Tejgad, Kadv\u00e1l, Jetpur, Jhabug\u00e1m, P\u00e1nvad, Kav\u00e1nt, Kar\u00e1li, R\u00e1j V\u00e1sna, and Targol. Sursi or Dor in the extreme north-east with thirty-three villages, formerly belonged to Ali R\u00e1jpur, but was mortgaged, in 1807, to the R\u00e1ja of Chhota Udepur for \u00a310,584 8s. (Rs. 1,05,844), and has ever since remained in his possession. The Ali R\u00e1jpur chief has more than once attempted to recover the property through the mediation of Government. But the Government of India have settled that these villages must remain with the state of Udepur, till the whole sum for which they were mortgaged together with interest is paid. As interest has been running since the beginning of the century, there is little chance that such a payment will ever be made. The Ali R\u00e1jpur boundary has been marked off, and Sursi is now practically part of Chhota Udepur. Its people are almost all Bhils and Kolis, and except near the hamlets, the country is waste and covered with forests. The chief crops are, in the rainy season, maize the staple, a little rice, and the coarser grains banti, h\u00e1vta, kodra, and jh\u00e1bi; and in the cold weather, gram and wheat. The tillage is rude and careless. West of Sursi, Tejgad, with seventy-seven villages including Udepur the capital of the state, has the B\u00e1r\u00edya hills on the north, Sursi on the east, the river Orsang on the south, and Jetpur and Kadv\u00e1l on the west. Like Sursi, the country is hilly and wooded, with scattered hamlets and patches of tillage. The population, crops, and style of tillage are much the same as those of Sursi. Palm trees both coconut and wild date, found all over Chhota Udepur, are commonest in Tejgad. They do much to lower the state of the Bhils, who having a right to the juice, when the sap begins to rise, camp under\none of the trees and by the help of a small store of maize flour, men, women, and children, live on the fermented juice. In the north-west corner of the state, Kadva\u2019l, with sixteen villages, wild and beautiful with hills and forests, is very backward. South of Kadval and west of Tejgad, Jetpur, with seventy-six villages, has some of the best land in the state. Open, but thickly dotted with wild date trees, the soil is light and with thriftier less unskilled peasants would yield rich crops. At present the people and chief products differ little from those of Sursi. Panvad, to the south-east of Tejgad, with eighty-five villages, is a rich well-watered tract crossed from north-east to south-west by a range of hills. Water is near the surface, and the soil is rich. In the rains, millet the staple, and rice grow well; and in the cold weather there are luxuriant crops of wheat and gram. Cotton, if its cultivation was fostered, would flourish. South of Panvad are the fifty-four villages of Kavant. The country, crossed from north to south by a well planned road, is hilly throughout, and in the south is wild and rugged. The people and tillage are very backward. In patches near hamlets, Indian corn and millet are grown in the rains, and wheat and barley in the cold weather. This sub-division contains two places of some interest, Hamph a place of pilgrimage on the Narbada (see p. 161), and three or four miles south of Kavant, Mohan, an old capital of the Chhota Udepur chiefs.\n\nWest of Panvad, the thirty-eight villages of Karali, in the north, open and with good black soil, stretch south into a hilly broken country. Though the crops are much the same as in other parts of Chhota Udepur, and though most of the people are Bhils, an intermixture of Kanbis has done something to better the style of tillage. To the north of Karali and between it and Jetpur, lie the eight villages of Jhabugam, watered by the river Orsang, in soil and products like Karali. These villages, formerly shared between the Gaikwar and the Udepur chief, were, in 1873, as part of a general settlement of claims, made over to Udepur. To the south of Jhabugam, are the twenty-three villages of Raj Vasa, originally thirty-four, and reduced to their present number, in 1873, when the claims of the Gaikwar and the Udepur chief were settled. This sub-division, level and well supplied with water, and with a loamy soil partly deep black, partly light, is the richest and best tilled portion of the Chhota Udepur state, yielding millet, pulse, gram, rice, cotton, and sugarcane. Tarol, the last sub-division, a small tract of nine villages, lies to the west of Raj Vasa, isolated from the rest of Udepur by the small state of Jambughoda in the Panch Mahals. The country is covered with hills and forest, the people are almost entirely Bhils, and the products little beyond inferior crops of maize, millet, pulse, and such coarser grains as kodra, banti, and lavto.\n\nThe Chhota Udepur chiefs claim to belong to the clan of Khichi Chohans, whose head Anhal is said to have been created by Vasisht Muni out of the Agni Kund on mount Abu. Ajayapal, one of Anhal\u2019s successors, founded the city of Ajmir, and another named Manikrai, settling at Sambhar, has handed down the title of Sambhri Rao or\nLords of Sambhar. Descended from Manikrai, the Khichi Chohans first settled in the remote Sind Sagar, a tract extending over about 100 miles (68 kos) between the Behut and the Sind, whose capital was Khichpur Patan. One of the successors of Manikrai was Bir Bilandev or Dharmagaj, who, in the beginning of the eleventh century, defended Ajmir against Mahmud of Ghazni. His successor Bidaldev or Visaldev, flourished from 1010 to 1074, and was the founder of the town of Vissahagar in north Gujar\u00e1t. The successors of Visaldev were Sarangdev, Ano, Jepal, Ananddev, Someshvar, and Prithiraj Chohan, the celebrated hero of Chand\u2019s great epic the Prithiraj Ras\u00f3. After the defeat of Prithiraj, who fell in 1193 fighting against Shahab-ud-din Ghori, the Khichis settled in a part of Malwa called after them the Khichi Vada. In 1300 Khichi Hamir, descendant of Prithiraj, distinguished himself by his gallant defence of Ranthambhor against Ala-ud-din Khilji. After the fall of Ranthambhor a body of Khichis moved to Gujar\u00e1t, and there conquered the kingdom of Champ\u00e1ner at the foot of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hill. Here they continued to rule till, in 1484, their city and hill fort were captured by Mahmud Begada (1459 - 1511). Jayasing, the last Chohan Raja of Champ\u00e1ner, the P\u00e1tai R\u00e1val of the bards, was killed by Mahmud Begada in 1484. Of his three sons, Rayasing died during his father\u2019s lifetime, Limbaji the second escaped at the fall of Champ\u00e1ner, and the third Tejsing was taken prisoner and became a Musalm\u00e1n.\n\nAccording to bardic accounts a son of Rayasing escaping from Champ\u00e1ner, settled at H\u00e1mp a small out-of-the-way hamlet on the right bank of the Narbada. Left unmolested in this wild country, he and his descendants established claims of tribute over a large tract of east Gujar\u00e1t, and, later on, in the decay of the authority of the Ahmedabad kings (1540 - 1572), were able to spread their power, and move their head-quarters to Mohan in a richer and less remote part of the country. Commanding the pass into the difficult tracts on the banks of the Narbada, the site was well chosen, and its ruins show that Mohan was once a place of considerable importance.\n\nAlong with Rajpipla and Godhra, Muhammadan historians seem to include Mohan, or Ali Mohan, under the name P\u00e1l. But at the close of the sixteenth century it was recognized as a separate district. Abul Fazl in the Ain-i-Akbari states that \u2018to the east of Nandarb\u00e1r, to the north of Mendo, to the south of Nadowt\n\n---\n\n1 Tod\u2019s Rajasth\u00e1n, II. 411, 416.\n2 The fort was not taken without much difficulty. Hamir and all the new Musalmans or converted Moghals, who were with him, were slain.

It was under a Choh\u00e9n Th\u00e1kor, whose capital was Ali Mohan (Almydhan), and who had a force of 600 horsemen and 15,000 foot. In course of time, probably during the decay of Moghal power in the early part of the eighteenth century, the capital was moved twenty miles north to Chhota Udepur on the banks of the Or. The site was well suited for trade, but it was a place of no strength and the chiefs were, before long, forced to pay tribute to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. B\u00e1ji R\u00e1val, who is said to have founded Chhota Udepur, died childless, and was succeeded by his cousin Durjansing, and he by his grand-nephew Amarsing. After Amarsing came Abhayasing, and he, shortly after, being killed by a fall from his horse, was succeeded by R\u00e1yasing, who in 1813 built the Udepur fort. Dying in 1819, R\u00e1yasing was succeeded by his son Prithir\u00e1j, the ruling chief in 1822 when, on its guaranteeing a yearly tribute of \u00a3877 (Baroda Rs. 10,500), the control of the state was transferred to the British Government by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. After his death, in 1832, his cousin Gum\u00e1nsing succeeded, who, dying in 1851, left as heir the present R\u00e1ja Jitsing born in 1834. On the 29th November 1858, T\u00e1tia Topi, then in rebellion against the British Government, appeared with a strong army before Udepur. Though the defences of the town were weak, the R\u00e1ja shut his gates and stoutly refused to let T\u00e1tia Topi enter, threatening that if he forced his way in, he would kill his R\u00e1nis and children, and himself commit suicide. T\u00e1tia refrained and pitched his camp on the plain on the east side of the town. On the following day the rebels entered and plundered the town. T\u00e1tia had intended to halt at Chhota Udepur to recruit his men and to develop his intrigues with the Baroda Sard\u00e1rs, but Brigadier Parke, who was on his track, gave him no respite. On the 1st December 1858 he fell upon T\u00e1tia\u2019s rebel force and defeated it with great slaughter, his loss being trifling. This defeat caused great confusion in the ranks of the insurgents. T\u00e1tia abandoned his army and fled to the forest lands of P\u00e1rona.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja is a chief of the second class and is entitled to a salute of nine guns. He pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3877 (Baroda Rs. 10,500), receiving in return a dress of honour. He also receives small sums aggregating \u00a362 (Rs. 620) a year from villages in G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory, in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha, and in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, and \u00a350 (Rs. 500) a year from the Th\u00e1kor of Gad.\n\nThe following is, as far as can be ascertained, the Chhota Udepur family tree. It is defective in several respects.\n\n---\n\n1 Gladwin\u2019s \u00c1in-i-Akbari, II. 72. A few years later (1609), the Ali Mohan contingent to the Gujar\u00e1t frontier force was 350 men. Major Watson, 69.\n2 Of the date of the change no record remains, and the name of the chief B\u00e1ji R\u00e1val who is said to have moved the capital, does not appear in the Chhota Udepur R\u00e1ja\u2019s family tree.\n3 According to the R\u00e1jas\u2019 list, six R\u00e1j\u00e1s reigned between the founder and Durjansing. These were: Karansing, Vajessing, Gum\u00e1nsing, R\u00e1yasing, Tejsing (who founded the town of Tejgad), and Jasvantsing.\n4 The names of Amarsing and Abhayasing are not mentioned in the R\u00e1jas\u2019 list.\n5 Aitchison\u2019s Treaties (1876), IV. 275-277.\nBa'riya, called after the B\u00e1riya Kolis who held it before the Rajput conquest, between $22^\\circ 21'$ and $22^\\circ 58'$ north latitude, and $73^\\circ 41'$ and $74^\\circ 18'$ east longitude, has an area of 813 square miles, a population, in 1872, of 52,421 souls or 64.48 to the square mile, and, during the five years ending 1878, an average yearly revenue of \u00a317,500 (Rs. 1,75,000).\n\nIt is bounded on the north by the Rewa K\u00e1ntha estate of Sanjeli; on the east by the Jh\u00e1lod and Dohad sub-divisions of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls; on the south by the Rewa K\u00e1ntha state of Chhota Udepur and of K\u00e1thiv\u00e1da under the Bhop\u00e1var Agency, and the Bhil estate of J\u00e1mbughoda in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls; and on the west by K\u00e1lol and Godhra in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. Its extreme length from north to south is thirty-nine miles.\n\nTriangular in shape, about thirty-nine miles from north to south, and gradually narrowing from forty-five miles in the south to eight miles in the north, the country is, except some open plains, covered with hills and woods.\n\nThe chief rivers are the P\u00e1nam and the Haraph. The P\u00e1nam flows north-west from the Ratanm\u00e1l hills dividing the state into two unequal parts. The Haraph runs parallel to the P\u00e1nam about twelve miles north of it. Two other streams, the Goma and Karad flowing west to the Mahi from the south of the state, are of little consequence. The supply of water is from wells, village ponds, and river beds.\nIn the west, the country, generally flat, is here and there broken by isolated hills. To the south and east, the hills are higher and more connected, until, along the south frontier, they form an unbroken line stretching from east to west, and forming the watershed between the Mahi and Narbada. A similar line of hills stretches north from the Ratam\u00e1l range, and forms the water-shed between the Mahi and the Ban\u00e1s. From this range, many side spurs run west, falling in height and importance, as they stretch further from the table-land. North of the P\u00e1nam, long lines of hog-backed hills run north-west nearly parallel with the boundary of the state till it reaches Sanjeli. None of the hills rise to more than 1200 feet above the sea.\n\nThe climate is damp and unhealthy, with much fever.\n\nThe chief products are timber, maize, pulse, gram, wheat, banti, h\u00e1vto, kodra, oil seeds, and, in a few places, sugarcane. There are no mines and no manufactures.\n\nIn 1869, a rough census gave a population of 49,220 souls, of whom 48,127 were Hindus, 1081 Musalm\u00e1ns, and 12 P\u00e1rsis. The 1872 census showed a population of 52,421 souls or 64\u00b748 to the square mile. Of the whole number, 51,309 or 97\u00b787 per cent were Hindus, 1095 or 2\u00b709 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, and 17 P\u00e1rsis. Of the Hindus 441 were classed as Br\u00e1hmans; 542 as Kshatris, Rajputs; 1374 as Vaishas, traders and merchants; 5315 as Shudras, cultivators, craftsmen, labourers and depressed classes; and 43,637 as unsettled tribes, including 26,524 Kolis, 13,713 Bhils, 3397 Naikd\u00e1s, and 3 Jats. Of the 51,309 Hindus, 1565 were Vaishnavs, 427 of them R\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00edjs, 78 Sv\u00e1min\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1ns and 1060 Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1ris, 412 were Sha\u00edvs, 19 Shr\u00e1vaks, 47 ascetics, and 49,266 of no special sect. Of the Musalm\u00e1ns 25 were Syeds, 377 Shaikhs, 157 Path\u00e1ns, 84 Bohor\u00e1s, 2 Khoj\u00e1s, 45 Arabs, 179 Makr\u00e1mis, and 226 were entered as \u2018Others\u2019. Of the whole number 989 were Sunnis, and 106 were Shi\u00e1s. Of the P\u00e1rsis 7 were Shahansh\u00e1\u00eds and 10 Kadmis. The number of villages was 478 or 0\u00b758 to the square mile; the average village population 109\u00b766 persons to the village. Of the whole number, 424 villages had less than 200 inhabitants; 48 from 200 to 500; 5 from 500 to 1000; and one, the town of B\u00e1riya, from 2000 to 3000. There were 12,404 houses or an average of 15\u00b725 houses to the square mile and 4\u00b722 persons to each house. Of the total number of houses, 544 inhabited by 1739 persons were of the better, and 11,860 occupied by 50,682 persons of the poorer sort.\n\nThe lands of the state are distributed over seven sub-divisions: Randhikpur; Dudhia; Umaria; Haveli; K\u00e1kadkhila; S\u00e1g\u00e1tala; and R\u00e1jgad. RANDHIKPUR in the north has fifty-nine villages most of them small, poor, and almost entirely peopled by Bhils. DUDHIA has sixty-seven villages, where tillage, though rude and imperfect, is better than in Randhikpur. Some of the husbandmen are Kanbis, induced to settle in Dudhia by the late chief, who gave many privileges, freeing them from import and export duties. UMARIA is a wild hill and forest tract of forty-four villages, its people almost all Kolis and Bhils. HAVELI is the largest and next to R\u00e1jgad the most flourishing of the B\u00e1riya sub-divisions. It has seventy-three\nvillages including the capital, Devgad Bariya. Kadkhila has fifty-seven villages, the people in nearly equal proportion Bhils and Kolis, with a small sprinkling of Naikdas. The country is wild, waving hills and forests, and in the low ground patches of cleared land with here and there detached Bhil or Koli huts. Sagatala to the south of Bariya, has forty-five villages peopled almost entirely by Kolis and Naikdas. Rajgad is the best tilled, and for its size the most productive of the Bariya sub-divisions. This is in part owing to a fair sprinkling of Brahman and Kanbi husbandmen, partly to the greater richness of the soil, and partly to its neighbourhood to the ancient capital of Champarner and to the more modern and thriving district of Kalol. In 1865 of 153 wells, the total return for the whole state, 110 were in Rajgad. Of late years sugarcane tillage has greatly spread. Many Naikdas live in the lonelier parts, but the bulk of the people are Kolis.\n\nThe Rajas of Bariya are said to belong to the same class of Khichi Chohan Rajputs as the Rajas of Chhota Udepur. It has been shown in the historical sketch of Chhota Udepur, that after the fall of Patai Raval of Champarner, his grandson Prithiraj took refuge in the village of Hamph on the Narbada, where he established himself, and plundered the neighbouring districts. To keep him quiet the Gujarati Viceroys allowed him a fourth share, chauth, of the revenues of Halol and Kalol. His son Dungarsing conquered Bariya from the Bhils. According to another bardic account Pratapsing, the son of Patai Raval, established himself at Hamph, and his son Rayasing founded the principality of Chhota Udepur. Trimbaksing, the son and successor of Rayasing, conquered Bariya from the Bhils, and about 1670, before starting on a pilgrimage to Gaya, divided his possessions among his two sons, giving Chhota Udepur to Rayaji the elder, and Bariya to Dungarji the younger. Dungarsing's successors were Udesing, Rayasing, Vijaysing, and Mansing about whom nothing certain is known, except that Mansing's reign ended about 1720. At his death, a Beluch soldier seized the government, and the Rani, taking her young son Prithiraj, fled to her father the Raval of Dungarpur. Here Prithiraj stayed for twelve years, and then (1732) returning, drove out the usurper, built the present town of Bariya, and called it Devgad or God's fort. At this time the one-fourth share of the Dohad revenue was, in return for a money advance, ceded to Bariya by the chief of Sunth. About the middle of the eighteenth century, the Maratha armies under Udaji Puar, Malharrao Holkar, and Jankoji Sindia entered Bariya. They did not call on the chief to pay tribute, but, acknowledging him lord of his own lands, encouraged him to protect the country from freebooters and allowed him to levy tribute from Halol, Kalol, and Dohad.\n\n---\n\n1 Of the former Koli or Bhil rulers of Bariya, traces remain in the family of Bhils at Bariya, who take the leading part in the three-year festival to the Devgad gods, and in the Bariyas of Paroli in Rajgad who have the right of presenting each new chief with a dagger, and claim to have once held the country between Pavagad and the river Panam.\n\n2 His predecessors lived in another Bariya village, now known as old Bariya.\nPrithiraj was succeeded by R\u00e1yadharji. To the other three sons S\u00e1matsing, Harising, and R\u00e1msing, and to the two daughters, grants of villages were made, which their descendants still keep on condition that the holders continue to live in the town of B\u00e1riya. R\u00e1yadharji was succeeded by Gangd\u00e1sji, and he by Gambhirsing, who was followed by Dhiratsing, and he by S\u00e1hebsing. When, about the end of the 18th century, Mah\u00e1d\u00e1ji Sindia passed through B\u00e1riya in pursuit of R\u00e1ghoba, the R\u00e1ja was treated with kindness and presented with gifts. S\u00e1hebsing was succeeded by Yashvantsing and Yashvantsing by his son Gangd\u00e1s. During the reign of this chief, B\u00e1riya suffered from Mar\u00e1tha raids. In 1802 N\u00e1goji V\u00e1hji, an officer of Sindia\u2019s, levied a sum of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000), and, two years later, Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v exacted \u00a38400 (Rs. 84,000). In 1805 Sambh\u00e1j\u00ed \u00c1ngria, on the part of Sindia, extorted \u00a31400 (Rs. 14,000); and in the following year Bhujangr\u00e1v, an officer of the same government, levied \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000), and Mahipatr\u00e1v, one of Holkar\u2019s commanders, collected \u00a33300 (Rs. 33,000). In 1808 B\u00e1pu Sindia not only exacted \u00a32300 (Rs. 23,000), but plundered the capital. From 1810 to 1815 R\u00e1md\u00edn, Roshan Beg, B\u00e1pu Raghun\u00e1th of Dh\u00e1r, and Govindr\u00e1v Bolia levied contributions. R\u00e1ja Gangd\u00e1s was so imbecile, that the government continued to be under the control of his mother till, in 1817, she was treacherously murdered by a Br\u00e1hman named N\u00e1ranji Dave. This man, a dismissed manager of the R\u00e1jgad sub-division, had entered the service of Krishn\u00e1ji the manager of Godhra, who gave him the command of 100 horse and 400 foot. Shortly after, he made use of the chance given by Krishn\u00e1ji\u2019s moving out to collect the revenues to plan an attack on B\u00e1riya. At Dohad, by a promise of \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000), he induced Krishn\u00e1ji to agree to his taking a party of 100 horse and 300 foot to carry his designs into execution. With these he proceeded to B\u00e1riya and, on drawing near, left the main body and with only twenty-five followers entered the town. At night he privately entered the palace and, putting the R\u00e1ni in fear of the Godhra troops, induced her to leave the palace and put her to death. He then plundered her estate, killed Ratan Sabh\u00e1n her confidential servant, and, intending to destroy him, put the chief in confinement. Escaping to Chhota Udepur, the chief was brought back (1817-18). And soon after, in a fight with Vithoji the brother of the Godhra manager, the usurper N\u00e1ranji was mortally wounded.\n\nThe connection between the British Government and B\u00e1riya state dates from 1803, when Daulatr\u00e1v Sindia\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t districts were taken by a British force commanded by Colonel Murray. The success of that campaign was greatly due to the friendship and\n\n---\n\n1 In Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII.

It was subject to attacks from Sindia\u2019s troops, and sometimes had to pay heavily before they withdrew, but it escaped a yearly tribute and maintained its right to share in the revenues of H\u00e1lo, K\u00e1lol, and Dohad, which, in 1819, was commuted into a yearly payment of \u00a3414 (Baroda Rs. 4750). R\u00e1ja Gangd\u00e1s died in 1819. The minister Rupji immediately seized the government, and raised to the chiefship a child called Bhimsing, the son of a Bhil, who had been adopted by one of the late chief\u2019s wives to the exclusion of Prithir\u00e1j, his lawful son. Soon after, Rupji was supplanted by his brother Jijibh\u00e1i, who removed the spurious Bhimsing and raised Prithir\u00e1j to the chiefship. Jijibh\u00e1i mismanaged the state so scandalously, that, in 1824, he was removed by Captain MacDonald, then in political charge, and his place given to Nathubh\u00e1i a relation of the chief. Prithir\u00e1j was then seven years old. In 1824 the state agreed to pay for British protection a yearly sum of \u00a3933 12s. 6d. (S\u00e1lamsh\u00e1\u00ed Rs. 12,000). This, which at first was to rise with the prosperity of the state, was fixed in 1849.\u00b3 This amount is still paid, but, under orders issued in 1868, it is spent for the good of the country or in matters connected with the management of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Agency. In 1838 Keval N\u00e1ik and his brothers of the village of B\u00e1ra in the S\u00e1gt\u00e1l\u00e1 sub-division of B\u00e1riya, with other Udepur and the Panch Mah\u00e1ls N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s, harassed the country. Government interfered, restored order, and took S\u00e1gt\u00e1l\u00e1 under their direct management. Prithir\u00e1j died in 1864, and as his son M\u00e1nsingji was only eight years old, the charge of the estate was entrusted to the Political Agent. It remained under direct management till, in November 1876, on his coming of age, it was handed over to the young chief. Since 1864, except for the N\u00e1ikda rising in 1868, in which the B\u00e1riya post of R\u00e1jgad was burnt, order has been unbroken.\u2074\n\nDuring the eleven years of direct management, Bariya made very great progress. The whole district was surveyed, and of its 439 villages the limits were fixed, and the lands measured and mapped. By revising the rates, introducing better supervision, and abolishing monopolies and farms, the customs revenue was raised from \u00a35132 (Rs. 51,328) in 1864-65 to \u00a36989 (Rs. 69,891) in 1875-76; the land revenue from \u00a37869 (Rs. 78,688) to \u00a38008 (Rs. 80,077); and the total receipts from \u00a315,232 (Rs. 1,52,318) to \u00a317,210 (Rs. 1,72,097), and though more than \u00a371,684 (Rs. 7,16,845) were spent on works of\n\n\u00b9 When the war with Sindia broke out, the B\u00e1riya chief freely and zealously aided the British commander by keeping open his communications and furnishing supplies.

An efficient federal police was organized, and traders, where they formerly risked almost certain robbery, can now pass without escort or fear. A dispensary has been opened, and large numbers of children have been vaccinated. Schools have risen from one to fourteen and pupils from 100 to 632. The young R\u00e1ja has been educated at the Ahmedabad T\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri school, and the R\u00e1jkot R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College. He is a chief of the second class, and is entitled to a salute of nine guns. Probably from the late date at which the present family was established at B\u00e1riya, the state is very free from sharers and cadets, and the amount of alienations is small, chiefly confined to villages close to the capital. In this state there is a remarkable absence of nobles, sard\u00e1rs, vassals, pat\u00e1vats, or cadets, bh\u00e1y\u00e1ds.\n\nThe following is, as far as can be ascertained, the B\u00e1riya family tree.

Irregular in shape with many outlying villages, its lands are much mixed with those of B\u00e1lasinor and the British Panch Mah\u00e1ls. Its extreme length from north to south is thirty-four, and its extreme breadth from east to west twenty-five, miles.\n\nThe soil is generally stony and the country open and rocky with, in places, low scantily wooded hills.\n\nBesides the Mahi, flowing through the district from the north-east to the south-west, and the P\u00e1nam in the south flowing west into the Mahi, there are of local streams the Bh\u00e1dar, which joins the Mahi, the Vehri which falls into the P\u00e1nam, and the Sheri which, taking its rise from the hills of Dh\u00e1mod in the Vardh\u00e1ri sub-division, joins the V\u00e1trak at the town of Kaira, and finally falls into the S\u00e1barmati. Besides ponds there are near very many villages a large number of wells, 642 of them built and 297 unbuilt.\n\nThe north of the state is very rugged, and in the south-east a chain of hills stretches from the town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da into Sunth. In the Vardh\u00e1ri sub-division, there is a central and a western ridge of moderately high hills, and in Nandarva are two nearly parallel ranges of crescent-shaped hills, steep but not very high.\n\nThe climate is perhaps somewhat cooler than in the neighbouring parts of Gujar\u00e1t. The prevailing disease is fever. The average fall of rain during the five years ending 1878 was thirty-nine inches. The highest and lowest ranges of the thermometer in the town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da during 1878 were 114\u00b0 in May and 50\u00b0 in February.\n\nCereals and timber are the chief products.\n\n\u00b9 Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da Balance Sheet, 1878.\n\n| RECEIPTS | \u00a3. | DISBURSEMENTS | \u00a3. |\n|----------|----|---------------|----|\n| Land Revenue | 8680 | Establishments | 1998 |\n| Transit Duties, s\u00e1gar | 1352 | Police and Military | 2725 |\n| Cesses | 788 | Jail | 582 |\n| Exchequer | 290 | Education | 473 |\n| Law and Justice | 263 | Medical | 205 |\n| Medical | 74 | Allowances | 553 |\n| Miscellaneous | 418 | Public works | 585 |\n| | | State charges | 1488 |\n| | | Transfers and fixed payments | 2048 |\n| | | Survey charges | 285 |\n| | | Interest on Loans | 332 |\n| | | Miscellaneous | 804 |\n| | | R\u00e1ja's marriage charges | 3313 |\n\nTotal | 11,955 | Total | 15,359 |\nChapter XIII.\n\nStates.\n\nLunavada.\n\nPopulation.\n\nThe 1872 census showed a total population of 74,813 souls or 192\u00b781 to the square mile. Of the whole number 71,725 or 95\u00b787 per cent were Hindus, and 3088 or 4\u00b713 per cent Musalmans. Of the Hindus, 7976 were Br\u00e1hmans, priests; 2577 Rajputs, cultivators; 2201 V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, traders; 11,760 Kankis, cultivators; 162 K\u00e1chhi\u00e1s, cultivators; 856 Suth\u00e1rs, carpenters; 910 Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 193 Kadi\u00e1s, bricklayers; 944 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 507 Darjis, tailors; 127 Gol\u00e1s, rice-beaters; 1014 Haj\u00e1ms, barbers; 701 Bhois and 1258 M\u00e1chhis, fishers; 124 Bharv\u00e1ds, shepherds; 198 Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s, carriers; 308 Gos\u00e1\u00eds, religious beggars; of unsettled tribes, 33,117 Kolis and Bhils; and of depressed classes, 209 Turis, 207 Garud\u00e1s, 112 Dabgars, 4484 Dheds, 730 Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s, 135 Bh\u00e1mbhis, and 478 Bhangis.\n\nOf the 71,725 Hindus, 15,564 were Vaishnavs, 4791 of them Virvaishnavs, 8852 R\u00e1m\u00e1nujs, 543 Sv\u00e1min\u00e1r\u00e1yans, 1329 Vallabhach\u00e1ris, and 49 Kabirpanthis; 10,846 were Shaivs; 468 Shravaks; 5 Ascetics; and 44,842 of no special sect. Of the 3088 Musalmans 2450 were Sunnis, 74 of them Syeds, 490 Shaikhs, 420 Path\u00e1ns, 14 Moghals, 167 Arabs, 30 Makr\u00e1nis, and 1255 'Others'; and 638, all of them Bohor\u00e1s, were Shi\u00e1s. The number of villages was 437 or 1\u00b712 to the square mile, and the average village population 171\u00b711. Of the whole number 334 villages had less than 200 inhabitants; 84 had from 200 to 500; 14 from 500 to 1000; 4 from 1000 to 2000; and one, the town of Lunavada, had 9662 souls, of whom 7206 were Hindus, and 2456 Musalmans. There were 17,357 houses or on an average 44\u00b756 houses to the square mile, and 4\u00b748 persons to each house. Of the houses 7614 with 33,172 inmates were of the better, and 9743 with 41,641 inmates of the lower, sort.\n\nSub-divisions.\n\nThe lands of the state are distributed over five sub-divisions, P\u00e1ndarv\u00e1da, Kh\u00e1npur, Haveli, Vardhari, and Nandarya. P\u00e1ndarv\u00e1da in the north, from being constantly exposed to the raids of its wild neighbours, is the least advanced part of the state. On the west lie the states of Magodi and Idar, on the east the wild villages of Kad\u00e1na, and on its north the P\u00e1l or Bhil country of Dungarpur. The most northerly villages are peopled by different tribes of Kolis or Bhils, whose main object in former times was to hold their own against their neighbours, and to refuse to pay tribute to any superior. This was especially the case with the large village of Chh\u00e1ni, and its hamlets in the extreme north of the state. Stretching over seven square miles its possession was hotly contested by the chiefs of Dungarpur and Lunavada. The villagers, knowing that the settlement of the quarrel would involve the loss of their freedom and the payment of tribute to one side or the other, fostered the dispute by alternately giving evidence in favour of each of the claimants. After much delay the dispute was, in 1872, decided in favour of Lunavada. Of the thirty-nine villages three are held on service, one on charitable, one on grant tenure, and thirty-four\n\n---\n\n1 Since this was written the sub-division of P\u00e1ndarv\u00e1da has been included under a new Kh\u00e1npur sub-division.\npay rent to the state. The people are nearly all Kolis and Bhils. Kh\u00e1npur, south of P\u00e1ndarv\u00e1da, has forty-one villages, seven of them held on service tenure, three assigned to temples, three given as maintenance, jiv\u00e1i, and two in gift, in\u00e1m. The remaining twenty-six pay rent to the state. Some villages of this sub-division have a fair number of settled Kanbi inhabitants. Others as Kh\u00e1npur and K\u00e1ranta in a difficult country are peopled entirely by Kolis, who in former times refused to pay any allegiance. K\u00e1ranta now a small village, in the angle formed by the meeting of the Bh\u00e1dar and the Mahi, was formerly a place of considerable note, and plays a leading part in the legends of the state. It is said that it was formerly ruled by a man of very low caste, who fell in love with a Br\u00e1hman's daughter, and demanded her in marriage. The Br\u00e1hman sought the help of Kutub Muhammad,\\(^1\\) a saint who lived at Shir\u00e1j, and who was a lineal descendant of Abb\u00e1s, the uncle of Muhammad. Kutub Muhammad came and completely destroyed the power of the low caste ruler of K\u00e1ranta. He then took up his residence in the town of K\u00e1ranta and worked many miracles. Crowds flocked to see him, and he healed the sick, stayed a pestilence, and caused water to flow in dry places. The neighbouring town of Virpur was at that time ruled by a Koli named Vir, who jealous of the saint's influence, harassed him in various ways. Kutub Muhammad sought the help of some Solanki Rajputs of the family of Sidhr\u00e1j Jayasing, the king of Anhilv\u00e1da P\u00e1tan, and with their aid drove out Vir from Virpur. The Rajputs established themselves there, and were the ancestors of the present Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da dynasty. The saint died, it is said, at K\u00e1ranta full of years and honour, and his shrine was visited yearly by thousands of pilgrims. Afterwards, his remains were taken to the tomb of his grandson, Dariyi S\u00e1heb at Virpur, and together they have been venerated.\\(^2\\)\n\nIt is said that the daughter of the Br\u00e1hman, for whose sake Kutub Muhammad came all the way from Shir\u00e1j, threw herself, weary of life and of the strife of which she was the innocent cause, into a pool in the Bh\u00e1dar river, and that her ghost still haunts it. The Cha'tkabeli or Haveli sub-division to the south of Kh\u00e1npur, in the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This account of Kutub Muhammad and his successors is taken from a Persian work Tukfat-ul-k\u00e1r-i-malfus, written in 1705 (1119 H.), by Mansur bin Ch\u00e1nd Muhammad of Ahmedabad.\n\n\\(^2\\) Another local legend tells how a blacksmith of the name of L\u00e1lia lived in Ahmedabad making axes and other Bhil tools. One day a Bhil came to him bringing an axe of L\u00e1lia's making, and complaining that it would not cut. L\u00e1lia on looking at it found that the blade was turned to gold. On questioning the Bhil, he found that he had tried to sharpen the axe on a stone he had brought with him, and L\u00e1lia immediately perceived that the man was in possession of the philosopher's stone. He bought it, but before he could use it, the news came to the ears of the Muhammadan king of the city, who immediately tried to get it. L\u00e1lia managed to escape, and arriving in the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da district built a fort near the village of Dh\u00e1mod, where for some time he opposed the army which was sent after him successfully. He eventually had to beat a retreat, and after various adventures took refuge near K\u00e1ranta, where, it is said, he built a fort. But he could not stand against the king's troops, and finding that he would have to retreat again, and believing the stone to be the source of all his troubles, he threw it into a deep pool in the Bh\u00e1dar river close to K\u00e1ranta. The king's troops vainly tried to find it. They threw in some iron chains, and had undisputable evidence of the existence of the stone, by finding some of the links turned to gold. But the stone they never discovered, and there it is said still to lie.\ncorner between the Mahi and Panam rivers, is the richest and largest sub-division of the district. Besides Lunavada it contains 130 villages, fifty of them state, khalsa, the rest either wholly or partly alienated. The Vardhari sub-division to the west of the Mahi is much mixed with Balasinor villages. Of 50 villages 36 belong to the state, 10 are held under quasi-proprietary tenure, and 4 are private, inam. The lands in the valley of the river Sheri form the most fertile portion of the sub-division. The chief crops are rice, millet, and banti. There are also grown bavta, kodra, mag, tal, guvar, adad, math, tuver, hemp, juvar, maize, castor-oil, wheat, tobacco, and gram. Except in some villages with a fair sprinkling of Kanbis, the people are Kolis. There is no market town; the only village of any trading consequence is Vardhari Dh\u00e1mod on the extreme western frontier of the state. This is connected with the fortunes of Lalia an Ahmedabad blacksmith, who is said to have become the holder of the philosopher's stone. Pursued by the Ahmedabad king, he took refuge at Dh\u00e1mod and gathering the Bhils, opposed the advance of the king's army. A fort consisting of several semi-circular bastions with a connecting parapet wall, is pointed out as Lalia's fort, and facing it, another building of much the same character is shown as the stronghold of the pursuing force. A fine mosque still in good repair shows that under the Musalmans Dh\u00e1mod was a place of some importance. The N\u00e1ndarva sub-division, to the south of the Mahi and Panam, is bounded on the north by those rivers with the exception of a small space where a portion of the Sunth state crosses the Panam, and intrudes wedge-shaped into N\u00e1ndarva. On its southern side it borders on Godhra with whose villages it is somewhat intermixed. Of eighty-six villages, fifty-six are state, khalsa, and the rest are held on some quasi-proprietary tenure. On the top of a hill overlooking the river Panam, stands the very lonely temple of Dehjaria Mah\u00e1dev. Its age is unknown. In old times the god is said, in answer to prayer, to have left near the temple anything his worshippers prayed for, on condition that they should return its value within a reasonable time. Many years ago some faithless votary forgetting to pay his debt, the god's favour was withdrawn. The staple grains are millet and rice, and the population is chiefly Koli, with here and there a small community of Kanbis.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Lunavada claim descent from the Solanki or Ch\u00e1lukya kings of Anhilv\u00e1da (942 - 1243). They are known by the name of Virpura Solankis,\u00b9 one of the sixteen branches, sh\u00fakh\u00e1s, into which the tribe is divided. According to the bardic account, R\u00e1j and Bij, two brothers of the Solanki clan, came to P\u00e1tan on their way from Tunk Toda, the country between the Ganges and Jamna, to Somn\u00e1th. R\u00e1j married Lil\u00e1devi the sister of S\u00e1matsing, the last Ch\u00e1potkat or Ch\u00e1vda king of Anhilv\u00e1da, and Mulr\u00e1j the son of R\u00e1j, killing his uncle S\u00e1matsing, usurped the Anhilv\u00e1da throne. Some lately-discovered metal-plate land grants of the\n\n\u00b9 Tod's R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 91.\nAnhilv\u00e1da Ch\u00e1lukyas, show that Mulr\u00e1j the founder of the Solanki dynasty in Gujar\u00e1t, was the son of R\u00e1ji the son of Bhuvanaditya and king of Kaly\u00e1n, the capital of the kingdom of Kanya Kubja or Kanouj, and he conquered Gujar\u00e1t from S\u00e1matsing.\n\nAccording to the bards, one Dhumaldev, a Solanki, went to Dholka in 1104 and to Karli in 1134, when Sidhr\u00e1j Jayasing was king of Anhilv\u00e1da. This Dhumaldev is probably Dhaval the founder of the Vy\u00e1ghrapalli or V\u00e1ghe branch of the Solankis, whose first seat of government was at Dholka. Virbhadra, the great grandson of Dhaval, left Karli and in 1225, killing Viro B\u00e1riya its chief, established himself at Virpur, a town about eight or nine miles west of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. His successors were Kikoji, Mahansing, M\u00e1hvsing, Gomsing, Prathamp\u00e1lakssing, Vikramsing, and Vithalsing. Vithalsing moved his capital from Virpur to Diya, a village on the Mahi three or four miles from Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and his successor Bhimsing founded the town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da in 1434. Of Virbhadra\u2019s settlement at Virpur, a bardic legend states that at that time one Viro B\u00e1riyo, a Koli, ruled over Virpur, and that he wanted to marry the daughter of a Br\u00e1hman of that place. The Br\u00e1hman asked Virbhadra\u2019s help against the Koli, and it was arranged that the Br\u00e1hman should give a seeming consent to the match, and should fix a day for the marriage, and that on that day Virbhadra should lie in wait with his followers and fall upon the Kolis. This plan was carried out. Virbhadra attacked the Kolis, routed them with great slaughter, and established himself at the Av\u00edchal M\u00e1ta at Virpur. Nothing is known of the Virpur chiefs, except that they spread their sway east to the site of the town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. The bard\u2019s story of the founding of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da runs as follows. Bhimsing one day went hunting across the Mahi, and getting separated from his companions, found himself near an ascetic\u2019s hut. Respectfully saluting the recluse, Bhimsing gained his goodwill and was told that there was a great future before him, and that passing east through the forest, at a spot where a hare should cross his path, he was to found a city. The R\u00e1na did as he was\n\n---\n\n1 Ind. Ant. VI.181. The bardic account is unworthy of credit except that it supports Dr. B\u00fchler\u2019s contention, that the Solankis of Gujar\u00e1t came from the north and not from the south. The idea of their having emigrated from Tunk Toda was very likely suggested to the bards by the fact that the ancestors of the present chiefs of Rupnagar in Meyw\u00e1r, who claimed descent from Sidhr\u00e1j Jayasing, possessed themselves of Tunk Toda (Tonk in Rajputana) after the overthrow of the Solanki dynasty in Gujar\u00e1t in 1297, whence they were driven out by the Afgh\u00e1ns. Tod\u2019s R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 578, 592.\n\n2 Karli is a village in Chuval on the road to P\u00e1tan from Virang\u00e1n. The Chuval bards trace some connection between the Chuval Solankis and the Ch\u00e1lukya R\u00e1jas of Anhilv\u00e1da. Detroj was the chief town of the Chuval Solankis, who afterwards intermarried with the Kolis. It is very probable that Dhaval and his descendants conquered Chuval after they had settled at Dholka.\n\n3 Dholka is a corruption of Dhavalgr\u00edha or the abode of Dhaval. Dhaval was married to the sister of the mother of Kum\u00e1rp\u00e1d, and by her had a son named Arnor\u00e1j, who served under Kum\u00e1rp\u00e1d. Arno\u2019s son was Lavanpr\u00e1sad, whose son Virdhaval was the famous R\u00e1na of Dholka (1220-1239).\n\n4 The father of Virbhadra was M\u00e1ldev, the son of Jetmal, the son of Dhumaldev. So that Virbhadra was a distant cousin of Virdhaval, in whose time he moved from Karli to Virpur.\n\n5 It seems at least as likely that Virpur was called after the Rajput founder Virbhadra.\nIt seems probable that Bhimsing was driven across the Mahi by the increasing power of the Ahmedabad kings, and that he chose the site of his new capital on account of its strong position. The town is sheltered by a fortified hill, strong enough to defy all the artillery that could at that time be brought against it, while the rugged hill and tangled forest at the back of the fortifications afforded a safe retreat, should the position be overpowered by superior force. According to the bards, Bhimsing's successors were Dhundhalr\u00e1ja, Dhavaldevsing, Viramdevji, Jesingdevji, Bhimdevji, Virprabalsingji, Prat\u00e1psingji, V\u00e1dor\u00e1van V\u00edrsingji, Viramdevji or R\u00e1na V\u00edr, R\u00e1ghavdevsingji, and Gangd\u00e1sji. But, as the last prince appears from an inscription on a brass image of the goddess Bhavaneshvari to have flourished in 1469, it seems probable that he was Bhimsing's immediate successor, and that the chiefs, given above, were the governors of Virpur subordinate to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. Gangd\u00e1s was followed by Uda Rana, who was succeeded by R\u00e1ghavr\u00e1n\u00e1sing or V\u00e1ghsing, who according to the bards, was a contemporary of Mahmud Begada (1459 - 1511). Soon after 1505, when Mahmud's general Bodi Moghal took B\u00e1lasinor, the Muhammadans seem to have pressed into Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, for in 1545 the R\u00e1ja of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da is said to have disturbed the country in consequence of the Muhammadan encroachments. V\u00e1ghsing was succeeded by M\u00e1lsing or M\u00e1lor\u00e1no, who, as shown by an inscription in a Jain temple in the town of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, continued to reign till 1575. His successor Vanvirji, as shewn in deeds of his granting, ruled at least till 1594. He was followed by Akher\u00e1j at whose death the direct line of R\u00e1j\u00e1s from Bhimsing came to an end, and Kumbho R\u00e1no of a collateral branch of the family was brought from the village of Gandh\u00e1ri, and invested with the chiefship. From an inscription on a stone, alleged to have been destroyed a few years ago in a boundary dispute between Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and \u0160unth, this R\u00e1ja reigned in the beginning of the seventeenth century. He was\n\n---\n\n1 This tale of the ascetic and the hare is commonly told of the founding of cities. It seems probable that Bhimsing called his new town Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da or Lavanv\u00e1da, in honour of his relative Lavanpras\u00e1d, chief of Dholka. Before the establishment of the Solankis at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Godhra was a state of considerable importance, said to have been subject to Virdhaval, R\u00e1na of Dholka. Inscriptions in the temples of Dehjar and Kakachia, now in the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da state, dated 1129 and 1331 A.D., prove a Rajput kingdom near Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da before the time of Bhimsing. The revolt of Dhundhal the R\u00e1ja of Godhra in the beginning of the thirteenth century, his defeat and capture by Vastup\u00e1l, the famous V\u00e1nia minister of Virdhaval of Dholka, and his suicide, have already been noticed.\n\n2 Major Watson's Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, 52.\n\n3 From a paper dated 1586, it appears that the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chief held the town of Virpur and its dependent villages, now included in the state of B\u00e1lasinor, and had wrested some villages to the north from the Virpura Solanki Th\u00e1kor of Meghraj, now of Mori, a cadet of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Idar. At the same time the country south of the P\u00e1nam, at present part of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, does not appear to have at that time been subject to the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chiefs. The supremacy over this part was contested by the chiefs of Godhra, and a cadet of the Solanki family, who ruled at Jh\u00e1nor in Th\u00e1sra.\nsucceeded by Jitsing, who appears from his written grants to have ruled as late as 1618. Jitsing was followed by Triloksing, of whom the only known date is 1619. His successor was Day\u00e1ld\u00e1s, who appears from entries on written grants to have reigned at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da in 1629 and 1637. He was succeeded by Chandrasing, whose reign seems to have lasted at least as late as 1674. This chief was a contemporary of R\u00e1o Punja of Idar, the son of R\u00e1o Jagann\u00e1th whose memory is cursed by the local bards. When Arjund\u00e1s, the brother of Punja, was meditating an attack on the Ahmedabad districts, he was joined by the princes, kuvars, of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Dungarpur, B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da, and Devalia, who were returning from Ahmedabad. They attempted to attack the town of Ran\u00e1san, but the Rehvar Rajputs of the place fell upon them, and in the fight, the princes of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Dungarpur, and Devalia, as well as Arjund\u00e1s were slain. Their bodies were taken away and burnt by the surviving kuvar of B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da. The next R\u00e1ja was Virsing, whose land-grants bear date as late as 1711. He was succeeded by Narsing, who ruled from 1712 to 1735, and, in 1718 (Samvat 1774 or Sh\u00e1ke 1640, Vaish\u00e1kh sud 10th), laid the foundation of the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da town wall. During his reign in 1722, Haidar Kuli Kh\u00e1n the Ahmedabad Viceroy levied a tribute of \u00a38000 (Rs. 80,000) from the state of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da.\n\nNarsing\u2019s successor was Vakhatsing, whose rule lasted from 1736 to 1757. At this time some Muhammadan generals from Ahmedabad went to Virpur under Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and in 1740, received two horses and \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000) as tribute from Sult\u00e1nsing, the agent of the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chief. In 1746, Malh\u00e1rr\u00e1o Holkar, on his way back from his yearly raid into M\u00e1lwa, was asked by the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chief to join him in attacking Virpur. Holkar agreed and Virpur was plundered. Vakhatsing was succeeded by Dipsing, who ruled from 1758 to 1782. In the first year of his rule Sad\u00e1shiv R\u00e1mchandra, one of the Peshwa\u2019s officers, marched against Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, demanded from Dipsing a tribute of \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000), and kept him a prisoner till the whole was paid. Dipsing was succeeded by Durjans\u00e1lji, who ruled from 1782 to 1786 when he was murdered by his manager Des\u00e1i Shankard\u00e1s of Nadi\u00e1d. The Des\u00e1i raised Durjans\u00e1lji\u2019s brother Jagatsing to the chiefship, and he continued in power for some months, though he was not recognized by the people who looked on him as a usurper. Meanwhile Khush\u00e1lkumarba, the mother of Durjans\u00e1lji, a resolute woman, and with her the widowed Rani, made their escape,\n\n---\n\n1 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 344.\n2-6 Major Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 96, 123, 132, 149, and 151.\n7 At this time the power of the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chief was on the decline. They had more powerful neighbours in the B\u00e1bis of B\u00e1ls\u00ednor, who not only encroached upon their estate of Virpur, but held several villages in the north of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. In 1717 a village in north Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, granted by the Emperor Firokshir of Delhi to a religious claimant, and in 1722 another village in the neighbourhood were given away by Sard\u00e1r Mahmud, the B\u00e1bi of B\u00e1ls\u00ednor. The names of Malekpur, Khanpur, and Rehman, villages in the north of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, still show how the power of the B\u00e1bi of B\u00e1ls\u00ednor had spread. On the other hand the power of the Godhra chiefs and the Lunav\u00e1da cadets, to the south of the river P\u00e1nam, began to wane, and the result was that what the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chiefs lost in the north and west they gained in the south and south-east.\nand returning shortly after murdered Shankard\u00e1s, and raised Prat\u00e1psing, the infant son of Durjans\u00e1lji to the chiefship in 1786.\n\nIn 1803 the Bombay Government entered into a convention with the R\u00e1ja, by which, on consideration of his furnishing a military contingent, he was insured protection and relief from the tribute hitherto paid to Sindia. This treaty was not ratified by the Governor General.\n\nIn 1812, through the medium of the Political Agent in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, the state entered into an engagement to pay the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3525 (Baroda Rs. 6001) without the intervention of an army. In 1816 Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da was plundered by the troops of the B\u00e1bi of B\u00e1las\u00ednor under Patel Bhagy\u00e1nd\u00e1s, and in 1817, an officer of the Pav\u00e1s of Dh\u00e1r named B\u00e1p\u00fa Raghn\u00e1th took possession of the town, held it for twenty-seven days, and left it only on the payment of a ransom of \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000). Mohansing one of Holkar\u2019s officers, the P\u00e1tankar of Sindia\u2019s Panch Mah\u00e1s and other freebooters, as well as Arjunsing of Gadh, a vassal of B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da, also levied contributions. A cadet of the B\u00e1bi family established himself in Virpur, and Sindia wrested from the state a yearly tribute of \u00a31065 (Baroda Rs. 12,000).\n\nIn 1819 an engagement was mediated between Sindia and the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chief, by which the British Government guaranteed the payment of the tribute on condition that Sindia would not interfere directly or indirectly in the affairs of the state.\n\nIn 1822, the engagements of 1812 were renewed and made lasting, and the state became formally entitled to British protection in accordance with the terms of the convention of the 3rd of April 1820. Previous to this, in the year 1819, an engagement had been entered into between Sir J. Malcolm on behalf of the British Government, and M\u00e1n sing P\u00e1tan kar on behalf of Sindia, in which the British guaranteed the perpetual payment by Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da of the tribute of \u00a31050 (B\u00e1b\u00e1sh\u00e1hi Rs. 12,001) on condition of Sindia\u2019s abstaining from all interference in the state. By these two agreements Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da came doubly under the protection of Government. The political control was, in 1825, transferred from the Mahi to the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Agency. After the convention with Sindia, in 1819, Shivsing, who was out in rebellion against Fatehsing, appealed to Sir J. Malcolm. A few months older than Fatehsing, he claimed on the score of primogeniture. He was told that the British Government had\n\n---\n\n1 About 1789, during the reign of this chief, \u2018the Diw\u00e1n\u2019 besieged Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, but failed in his attempts to take the place. The Diw\u00e1n was probably Diw\u00e1n Rangr\u00e1v Aur\u00f3kar of Dh\u00e1r.

Malcolm\u2019s Central India, II, 41\ndecided, as a general rule, to support the parties in possession, as the only mode of reducing to order the numerous disturbed principalities in central India. After this no further notice was taken of Shivsing's claims. Fatehsing died childless on the 27th June 1849. On the day of his death he adopted a collateral named Dalpatsing. The boy was recognized as heir by all the relatives, and his adoption was sanctioned by Government on the 29th August (1849), Fatehsing's mother N\u00e1n\u00edb\u00e1i being appointed regent. Dalpatsing died while still young, on the 4th October 1851, and pending the appointment of a successor, the regent N\u00e1n\u00edb\u00e1i remained in power. She died on the 23rd February 1852, before any decision was come to on the question of succession. About three weeks before her death, she had expressed a wish to adopt Dalelsing, a collateral fourth in descent from R\u00e1ja Narsingji, at the same time she stated that Ajitsing was nearest of kin, but that being of weak intellect she had passed him over. Ajitsing was fifth in descent from N\u00e1rsingji, but had been adopted by another N\u00e1rsing, the grandson of R\u00e1ja Vakhatsing, and by a reference to the family tree it will be seen that by this adoption he became the nearest living representative of the reigning family. He however acquiesced in the nomination of Dalelsing. The matter was referred for decision to the Court of Directors, and final orders were not passed till the 8th September 1852. The Court, in their despatch of the 1st July 1852, ruled that the regent N\u00e1n\u00edb\u00e1i had no right to confer political power on her nominee. At the same time they had no objection to Dalelsing being appointed R\u00e1ja of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da by the direct authority of the British Government. Four collaterals objected to this arrangement, Gemalbh\u00e1i, Mehrubh\u00e1i, Surajmal, and Makansing. It will be seen from the family tree, that the common ancestor of these claimants was R\u00e1ja Jitsing. They were therefore one generation nearer the reigning line than Dalelsing, and one generation more removed than Ajitsing. The two first of these claimants were never seriously opposed to the nomination of Dalelsing, and did not agitate their claims after he was put in power, but Surajmal and Makansing were bitterly hostile to him, and never recognized him as the rightful heir. During the 1857 mutinies, Surajmal took advantage of the disturbed state of the country, and went out in rebellion against the R\u00e1ja. He was secretly helped by Makansing, who supplied him with funds and information. Finding that his designs against Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da were thwarted, Surajmal eventually made his submission to the Political Agent, who secured for him from the R\u00e1ja a perpetual yearly grant of \u00a3110 (Rs. 1100). Surajmal died in the following year. The M\u00e1liv\u00e1ds a clan of Kolis, belonging to the Kh\u00e1npur sub-division, defied the authority of the R\u00e1ja, and would not allow a post to be established in the village of Kh\u00e1npur. During the sepoy revolt these M\u00e1liv\u00e1ds grew so troublesome, that Major Buckle, the Political Agent, marched against them, burnt their village, and apprehending their ringleaders, blew one of them from a gun. In 1870 they again became restless, and Captain Salmon, the Acting Political Agent, repaired to Kh\u00e1npur, and arrested the principal offenders, who were sentenced to various terms of imprison-\nThe Sunth R\u00e1j\u00e1s laid claim to a large tract of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da territory lying near their boundary, and even asserted that the true boundary of Sunth was an old well in the market of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da town. On the other hand Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da claimed part of Sunth, and at one time built some forts in a few of its villages. To such a height was the strife carried, that the Political Agent took the management of the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da-Sunth frontier into his own hands. On both sides a strong desire to settle the dispute by force of arms brought matters to a crisis. Some Arab and Path\u00e1n mercenaries had been posted at both ends of the frontier, and a scuffle took place, in which a few of the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da troops were killed. Both states now made large preparations, and a petty skirmish was kept up for a day by the militia and horse, aided by the counsels of the managers, k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ris, and other officials of the two states. There was more of shouting than of real fighting, and an amount of ammunition was spent which, if properly used, would have produced very serious effects. The fighting ended with the rout of the Sunth force, and the burning of the post of Th\u00e1mba in that state. The Mehv\u00e1si Kolis on both sides would have prolonged hostilities, had not the Political Agent interfered. An inquiry was instituted as to the cause of this disturbance, and both the R\u00e1j\u00e1s and their managers were heavily fined for presuming to resort to arms. R\u00e1ja Dalelsing died on the 19th June 1867. The day before his death he expressed a wish to adopt Vakhatsing the son of Ajitsing, who, as stated above, was the nearest collateral, but had been passed over by the regent N\u00e1n\u00edb\u00e1i in favour of Dalelsing. Vakhatsing was then in his seventh year. Subsequently Motiba, the widow of Dalelsing, was allowed to adopt Vakhatsing, paying the British Government a fine, nazar\u00e1na, of one year's revenue. The adoption ceremony was performed on the 7th October 1867, and the R\u00e1ja has since been receiving instruction, first at the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri school at Ahmedabad, and subsequently at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College, R\u00e1jkot. He is married to Sarupkuar, the daughter of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j of Kh\u00e1ndu, a Bh\u00e1y\u00e1d of the R\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da in Meyw\u00e1r. He is entitled to a salute of nine guns, and has power to try his own subjects for capital offences.\n\nBetween June 1867 and May 1879, the state was managed by an Assistant Political Agent, who since May 1879, has shared its administration with the chief, now nineteen years of age. During these twelve years, a detailed field survey of the state was completed, its boundaries demarcated, and its villages measured and mapped. The state land has been classified, and its assessment based on the survey principles current in British territory. Titles to alienated lands are being inquired into, and a quit-rent of 3\u00bdd. on every 2s. (2 annas in the rupee) of assessment is imposed on all rent-free lands unsupported by written grants. The crop-share, bh\u00e1gbat\u00e1i, or kal\u00edr, system, which afforded the Th\u00e1nd\u00e1rs means of illicit gain, has been superseded, and the land revenue has consequently increased about twenty-five per cent. The customs revenue has been nearly doubled by better supervision and the greater facilities afforded to trade. Still the state is crippled by excessive alienations and is barely able to pay its way. During the\nlast two years, from special marriage and famine charges, the debt, which had been reduced to \u00a36400, again rose to \u00a310,400. Civil and criminal courts have been established, and the regular state police has been incorporated into the Rewa K\u00e1ntha federal force. Among works of public usefulness, ten miles of a good road connecting the town with the Godhra highway have been made, school houses and police posts built, nine schools and a dispensary opened, vaccination largely introduced, and the town much improved by new buildings.\n\nThe following is the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da family tree:\n\n(XI.)

During the five years ending 1878 it had an estimated average yearly revenue of \u00a310,470 (Rs. 1,04,700).\u00b9\n\nIt is bounded on the north by Kad\u00e1na in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha and the states of Dungarpur and B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da under Meyw\u00e1r; on the east by the Jh\u00e1lod sub-division of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls; on the south by the Rewa K\u00e1ntha state of Sanjeli and the Godhra sub-division of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls; and on the west by the Rewa K\u00e1ntha state of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da.\n\nAspect.\n\nTo the north the country is fairly flat and open, crossed by several small streams on their way north to the Mahi; to the south it is rugged covered with long craggy lines of hills.\n\nRivers.\n\nThe Mahi flows through the north-west and the P\u00e1nam through the south-west corner of the state. Near the centre the small stream of Chibota passes by the village of Sunth, and towards the east the Suki flows past the town of R\u00e1mpur.\n\nHills.\n\nA line of hills, of no great height, running in a curve from the P\u00e1nam river in the south to the Mahi in the north, divides the state into two parts. Besides this principal chain, many other hills run in parallel lines from north to south.\n\nClimate.\n\nThe climate is generally unhealthy and feverish. Between 1874 and 1876 the highest thermometer reading was 103 and the lowest 50. The average fall of rain during the five years ending 1878 was 41\u00b79 inches.\u00b2\n\nSoil and Produce.\n\nThe only arable land is in the valleys, where the soil, well charged with moisture, yields without manure two crops a year of ordinary grain. Indian corn is the staple, and besides it millet, pulse, gram, wheat, banti, and in a few well-favoured spots sugarcane, are grown. The forests yield a large supply of timber.\n\nPopulation.\n\nThe 1872 census showed a total population of 49,675 souls or 126\u00b708 to the square mile.

Of the Hindus 701 were classed as Br\u00e1hmans; 626 as Kshatris, Rajputs; 745 as Vaishas, traders and merchants; 9309 as Shudras, cultivators, craftsmen, labourers, and depressed classes; and 37,256 as unsettled tribes including 36,923 Bhils and 333 N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s. Of the 48,687 Hindus, 838 were Vaishnavs, 64 of them Ramanujis, 170 Svamin\u00e1r\u00e1yans, and 599 Vallabh\u00e1charis; 691 were Shaivs; 185 Shravaks, 66 Ascetics, and 46,862 of no special sect. Of the 1038 Musalm\u00e1ns 9 were Syeds, 67 Shaikhs, 140 Path\u00e1ns, 126 Bohor\u00e1s, 3 K\u00e1bulis, 47 Arabs, 2 Baluchis, 61 Makr\u00e1nis, and 588 'Others'. Of the whole number 126 were Sunnis and 912 Shi\u00e1s. There were 578 villages or 1\u00b762 to the square mile, with, on an average, 85\u00b794 persons to each village. Of the whole number, 534 had less than 200 inhabitants, 39 had from 200 to 500, 4 from 500 to 1000, and one, the town of R\u00e1mpur between 2000 and 3000 inhabitants. There were 11,564 houses, or an average of 32\u00b754 to the square mile, and of 4\u00b729 persons to each house. Of the houses, 1194 inhabited by 5311 persons, were of the better, and 10,370, with 44,364 inhabitants, of the poorer sort.\n\nSunth was formerly divided into five districts, Fategad, V\u00e1nk\u00e1ner, M\u00e1lvan, Th\u00e1m\u00e1, and R\u00e1mpur. These have lately been reduced to two, the eastern and western divisions, nearly equal in size and divided by a range of hills. Sunth in the west and R\u00e1mpur in the east division are the only places of any size.\n\nThe Sunth chiefs, Puv\u00e1r or Parm\u00e1r Rajputs by caste, claim to belong to the Mahip\u00e1vat branch of the famous M\u00e1lwa dynasty which boasts of Vikram of Ujain in the first century before Christ, and of Bhoj of Dh\u00e1r in the eleventh century of the Christian era. According to the Sunth bards, whose accounts are full of confusion and error, J\u00e1lamsing, a Pav\u00e1r from mount \u00c1bu established his power at, and gave his name to, the town of Jh\u00e1lod in the Panch Mah\u00e1l\u00eds. J\u00e1lamsing's successors were Jh\u00e1jsing, Bikamsing, Udesing, Pr\u00e1t\u00e1psing, and J\u00e1lamsing. The last of these chiefs was in 1247 defeated and slain by the Musalm\u00e1ns. His son Sant and his brother Limdev, forced to leave Jh\u00e1lod, retired to the hills, and after a few years (1255), Sant settled at the Bhil village of Brahmpuri, changing its name to Sunth, and Limdev established himself at Kad\u00e1na. This may have been the date of the final settlement of the Rajputs at Sunth. But some tombstones, p\u00f3l\u00e1s, in the villages of Sunth and Sukhsar, between Sunth and Jh\u00e1lod, show that as early as 1218 and 1221 there were fights in which Rajputs of the Padhi\u00e1r or Par\u00edh\u00e1r clan with their chief Vijayadev were slain. According to the bards, R\u00e1na Sant was succeeded by Navghan, N\u00e1p\u00e1ji, Prithising, Sur\u00e1ji, Jesing, Akher\u00e1j, Gajsing, and Kumbho R\u00e1no, the last of whom is said to have lived at the time of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h I. (1411-1443)\n\n---\n\n1 Malcolm's Central India, I. 99. The Mahip\u00e1vat branch of the Parm\u00e1rs is in Meyw\u00e1r represented by the R\u00e1vs of Bijoli, one of the sixteen higher nobles of the Udepur R\u00e1na's court.

After this the state was tributary to the Ahmedabad kings, and, in their decline, received some additions of territory. On the transfer of power to the Emperor Akbar (1572) the tribute seems to have been changed into service with a contingent of troops. According to local accounts Kumbho R\u00e1no was succeeded by R\u00e1msing and R\u00e1ymal, whose successor Mandlik, as shown both in deeds and in temple inscriptions, ruled at Sunth between 1536 and 1565. M\u00e1ndlik was followed by Surajmal, Ratansing, Prithising, and Sabalsing, who, from a copper plate grant and the writing in a Mah\u00e1dev\u2019s temple in the village of Batakv\u00e1da, appears to have flourished between 1607 and 1635. Sabalsing was succeeded by Gajsing, M\u00e1hysing (1688-1704), Prithising (1728-1357), and Ratansing who died in 1753. Ratansing left some young sons and a daughter married to the B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da chief. A party, coming from B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da to Ratansing\u2019s funeral feast, taking advantage of the minority of the sons, killed three of them and established their chief\u2019s power over Sunth. The youngest son Badansing, a mere boy, was carried to the village of M\u00e1lvan, and after some time the Kh\u00e1nt Kolis of M\u00e1lvan taking up his cause attacked Sunth, drove out the B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da party, and established Badansing in the chiefship. Badansing, a warlike prince, increased his estates at the expense of his neighbour the Th\u00e1kor of Gad, a cadet of the B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da house, and continued to rule till after 1774. In 1803 his successor Shivsing entered into a defensive treaty with Colonel Murray, commanding the British forces in Gujar\u00e1t, a treaty that was subsequently disallowed by Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General. Shivsing was succeeded by Kesarising who died in 1819, leaving an infant son Gajsing who survived his father\u2019s death by only a few months. The next R\u00e1ja was Kali\u00e1nsing who continued to rule till 1835. In 1819 when Kali\u00e1nsing succeeded, Sunth was overrun by Sindia\u2019s troops and would have either been annexed or laid waste, had not the British Government stepped in, and, through the medium of Sir John Malcolm, arranged that on condition of Sindia withdrawing his troops it should pay a yearly tribute of about \u00a3610 (Baroda Rs. 7000). The control of the state vested in the British Government under this arrangement (1819) was afterwards made over (1825) to the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Political Agent. Kali\u00e1nsing died in 1835, leaving a son Bhav\u00e1nsing only three years old. During his minority the state was managed by his mother R\u00e1ni R\u00e1thodji Gul\u00e1bkunvarba, a woman of strong will, but no great ability.\n\n---\n\n1 It seems probable from his successes in east Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa that Ahmad Sh\u00e1h I. did force the Sunth chief to pay tribute. But in the Musalm\u00e1n historians no reference to the Sunth chief has been traced, and the site pointed out as the battle-field between Kumbho R\u00e1no and Sult\u00e1n Ahmad is the same as that where are tombstones bearing dates as far back as 1218 and 1221. That the Musalmans were at some time established in Sunth is shown by the remains of a mosque at Prathampur, five miles south of Sunth (see p. 116).\n\n2 Bird\u2019s Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahm\u00e1di, 1241.\n\n3 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 17.\n\n4 The terms of the treaty were the same as those for Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da.

Early in his reign he had much trouble with the Kh\u00e1nts who, presuming on the good services they had done his forefathers, refused to obey the R\u00e1ja and did much damage by making raids into Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Kad\u00e1na. Unable to bring them to order Bhav\u00e1nsing applied for help to the Political Agent, and with his aid and by his advice making some concessions to the Kh\u00e1nts, peace was restored. At the same time the Bhils on the north and east frontiers fighting with the chief of Gad caused much trouble. To overawe them a frontier fort named Fatehgad, or the fort of victory was built. But this measure failed and order was not restored till the Political Agent established a frontier military post with an officer under his own supervision. In 1865 the R\u00e1ja fell under the displeasure of Government for attempting, by force of arms, to settle a boundary dispute with his neighbour the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da chief. In 1870 on the occasion of the visit of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, the R\u00e1ja went to Bombay, and is said to have been so struck with the city, that he determined to improve the roads and buildings of his own capital. But in 1872, before any progress had been made with the proposed works, he died. With Bhav\u00e1nsing the main branch of the Sunth family came to an end. The Sunth family has not the right of adoption. But the privilege was granted to the widowed R\u00e1ni and she after much search, for the nearest collateral had branched off fourteen generations back, chose, with the approval of Government, a son of the S\u00e1ng\u00e1v\u00e1da family as heir. At the time of his adoption the young R\u00e1ja was about twelve years old. In the following year he was sent to the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College at R\u00e1jkot where he is still being educated (1879). In 1860, when the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were transferred by Sindia to the British Government, the R\u00e1ja of Sunth became a British tributary paying a yearly sum of about \u00a3610 (Baroda Rs. 7000) and receiving a robe, sirp\u00e1v, worth about \u00a33 (Rs. 30). He claims as choth, \u00a360 12s. 4d. (Rs. 606-2-7) from Panch Mah\u00e1ls and B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da villages.\u00b9 In January 1879 the young chief was married to Dari\u00e1vkuar, the daughter of the chief of Bambora in Meyw\u00e1r.\n\nThe state of Sunth came under direct management in June 1872, but it was not till April 1873 that permanent arrangements were made for its administration. As it was more backward than Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da no field survey was made. A circuit survey was completed and its internal and external boundaries were laid down. The revenue from some of the land was collected under the crop-share, bh\u00e1gbat\u00e1i or kaltar, system. In consequence of the abuses to which it gave rise, this system is being gradually superseded by a holding, kh\u00e1t\u00e1bandi, system under which the holdings are roughly measured in half acres, bigh\u00e1s, and a money assessment is imposed. An inquiry has been made into land alienations, and, under the rules sanctioned for Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, a quit-rent has been levied. The customs duties have been revised and better supervision and greater trade facilities provided. Civil and criminal courts have been established\n\n\u00b9 The amount of choth is as follows: from Gor\u00e1du in the Jh\u00e1lod sub-division, Rs. 44-2-7; from the Godhra sub-division, Rs. 170; from Chilk\u00e1ri under B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da, Rs. 317; from Sanjeli, Rs. 75; total, Rs. 606-2-7.\nlike those in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. A regular police force, organized and placed under the superintendent of the Federal Police, has, since 1873, greatly increased the security of person and property. R\u00e1mpur the chief town of the district has been connected with Godhra by a cleared road, part of which was made at Sunth expense. The Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da road formerly impassable for carts has been much improved especially where it crosses some small hills. In R\u00e1mpur good substantial buildings for the state officials and for a dispensary have been built, and the town has been joined to its new suburb, named Pr\u00e1t\u00e1ppura after the young chief, by a low level bridge across the river Suki. A good road with a double row of trees has been made from Sunth to the river Suki, and a few well built new houses add much to the appearance of the town. By sinking new and repairing old wells the water-supply has been greatly improved. Schools have increased from one to seven, and a dispensary, supplied with a good stock of medicines, is much resorted to by the poor.\n\nThe following is the Sunth family tree:\n\n```\nJ\u00e1lamsing (1247).\nLimdev (founded Kad\u00e1na).\n\n(I) Sant (founder of Sunth 1255).\n(II) Navghan.\n(III) N\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00ed.\n(IV) Prithising.\n(V) Sur\u00e1j\u00ed.\n(VI) Jesing.\n\n(VII) Akher\u00e1j.

Of the whole number 37,829 or 90\u00b710 per cent were Hindus, and 4155 or 9\u00b790 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the Hindus 2911 were classed as Br\u00e1hmans; 848 as Kshatris, Rajputs; 3178 as Vaishas, traders and merchants; and 11,714 as Sh\u00fadras, cultivators, craftsmen, labourers, and depressed classes; and 19,178 as unsettled tribes, 18,241 of them Kolis and 937 Bhils.

Of the whole number 3875 were Sunnis and 280 Shi\u00e1s. There were 249 villages or 1\u00b766 to the square mile, with on an average 168 persons to each village. Of these 193 had less than 200 inhabitants, 33 from 200 to 500, 16 from 500 to 1000, 5 from 1000 to 2000, one from 2000 to 3000, and one, the town of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, had 8836 inhabitants, of whom 6263 were Hindus, and 2573 Musalm\u00e1ns.

Of the total number of houses 2998 inhabited by 9755 persons were of the better, and 6686 with 32,229 inhabitants of the poorer sort.\n\nThis state is divided into two distinct and nearly equal parts, the sub-divisions of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor and of Virpur. Bounded on the north by the Rewa K\u00e1ntha state of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, on the east by Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and the Kaira district, on the south by Kaira, and on the west by Ahmedabad, the B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor sub-division consists of forty-one villages. The soil is rich yielding millet, rice, pulse, oil seeds, wheat, gram, and sugarcane. Except on the east, where the Mahi waters the villages on its banks, ponds and wells are used for irrigation. The Virpur sub-division is bounded on the north by Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and the Mahi K\u00e1ntha state of Magodi, on the east and south by Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, and on the west by the Mahi K\u00e1ntha petty states of S\u00e1thamba and G\u00e1b\u00e1t. Of its fifty-seven villages, which are much mixed with those of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, thirty-eight are state, kh\u00e1lso, and nineteen\n\n\u00b9 This revenue includes a yearly claim on Kaira villages amounting to about \u00a3358 (Rs. 3580) and \u00a385 (Rs. 847) from Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da.\nprivate, in\u00e1mi, held on service tenure. The soil is rich yielding rice, millet, pulse, oil-seeds, and, in watered lands, a little sugar-cane.\n\nOf the early history of B\u00e1lasinor nothing certain is known. It must have been part of the Solanki estate of Virpur, till in 1505, Virpur was conquered by Mahmud Begada\u2019s general Bodi Moghal. The fortunes of B\u00e1lasinor are closely connected with those of the celebrated B\u00e1bi family, to which its present ruler belongs. The founder of the family was Sher Kh\u00e1n who, about the middle of the seventeenth century, was made door-keeper, b\u00e1bi, of the Imperial Court, and in 1659 was appointed commandant, thand\u00e1r, of the troublesome Koli district of Chuv\u00e1l in the north-west of Ahmedabad. In 1693 his son Safdar Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi was governor of P\u00e1tan. In 1703 when Prince Muhammad \u00c1zam Sh\u00e1h was appointed Viceroy of Gujar\u00e1t, the Emperor sent an order to decoy Durg\u00e1d\u00e1s R\u00e1thod, governor of P\u00e1tan, to Ahmedabad, and either confine or slay him. This order Safdar Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi offered to carry out, but failed owing to the bravery of Durg\u00e1d\u00e1s\u2019 grandson who, covering his retreat with the loss of his own and all his followers\u2019 lives, gave his grandfather time to escape. Shortly after (1705) Safdar Kh\u00e1n, beaten by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at Ratanpur in R\u00e1jpipla, was taken prisoner and released only after paying a heavy ransom. About the same time Durg\u00e1d\u00e1s R\u00e1thod again went into rebellion, when Safdar Kh\u00e1n, on condition of being made governor, promised to kill or take Durg\u00e1d\u00e1s. The offer was accepted, and, as from that time Durg\u00e1d\u00e1s is no more spoken of, Safdar Kh\u00e1n would seem to have succeeded in killing him. In 1717 when Haid\u00e1r Kuli Kh\u00e1n was appointed deputy Viceroy, a dispute arose between him and Safdar Kh\u00e1n, and in the affray Safdar Kh\u00e1n\u2019s baggage was plundered. Collecting his followers Safdar Kh\u00e1n attacked the deputy Viceroy, but was defeated. In 1722 Muhammad Bah\u00e1dur, son of Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi, son of Safdar Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi, was, with the title of Sher Kh\u00e1n, placed in charge of S\u00e1dra and Virpur. Three years later (1725), Safdar Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi died. In 1728, on the death of the governor of Jun\u00e1gad, Sal\u00e1bat Muhammad Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi was appointed deputy governor and sent his son Sher Kh\u00e1n to act for him. Two years later Sal\u00e1bat Muhammad Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi died, and Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi, losing the government of Jun\u00e1gad, retired to his estate of Gogha. In the same year on paying his respects to the new Viceroy Abhayasing, he was confirmed in his father\u2019s lands, and, in 1732, on the capture of Baroda by the Viceroy, Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi was placed in charge of the city. In 1734, while Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi was visiting B\u00e1lasinor, Mah\u00e1d\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, brother of Pil\u00e1ji, who then held Jambusar, sending for aid to D\u00e1m\u00e1ji, marched on Baroda with a strong force. On his way to relieve the city, Sher Kh\u00e1n was defeated by Mah\u00e1d\u00e1ji, and forced to retire to B\u00e1lasinor, leaving Baroda to fall into the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r\u2019s hands. Shortly after, Rangoji the Deputy of Um\u00e1b\u00e1hi, quarrelled with Pun\u00e1ji Vithal, and asked Sher Khan B\u00e1bi to help him. To this Sher Kh\u00e1n agreed, but not having funds to pay his troops, at first delayed, and afterwards plundered Mahudha and Nadi\u00e1d. Not meeting with Rangoji, Sher Kh\u00e1n then went to Kapadvanj, and thence marched against the Mar\u00e1tha force.\nThe Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s attacked him, and in the conflict many men on both sides were slain. Next morning, after an indecisive engagement, fighting ceased, and at night Sher Kh\u00e1n stole off towards Kapadvanj, joining Rangoji\u2019s forces. Shortly after (1746), Sher Kh\u00e1n was wounded and forced to take shelter with Rangoji in Kapadvanj. The town was besieged by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, but, with the help of Holkar, it was relieved. At B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, in 1753, in a dispute between Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi and his mercenaries, the Arabs for a time took possession of the fortress on the hill. Shortly afterwards when Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi was in his estate in Sorath, Sad\u00e1shiv R\u00e1mchandra went from Porbandar to Jun\u00e1gad, where he was joined by Say\u00e1jir\u00e1o G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi was there presented with some horses, and appointed Mar\u00e1tha deputy. In 1758 Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi died at Jun\u00e1gad, and the nobles of his court seated his son Muhammad Mohobat Kh\u00e1n in his place. At B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi was succeeded by his son Sard\u00e1r Muhammad Kh\u00e1n who, opposing the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, was attacked by Sad\u00e1shiv R\u00e1mchandra, and forced to pay tribute. Two years later (1760), B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor was taken by the Mar\u00e1tha commander Bhagvantr\u00e1v and, in the next year, recovered by Sard\u00e1r Muhammad Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi who, on condition of paying tribute, was allowed to keep it.\n\nSard\u00e1r Muhammad Kh\u00e1n was succeeded by his son Jamiat Kh\u00e1n, and he by his son Sal\u00e1b\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n, during whose lifetime the control over the state came into the hands of the British Government. Meanwhile both the Peshwa and the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r had established tribute rights over B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor. In 1768, the Peshwa\u2019s manager at Ahmedabad levied a tribute of \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000), and this, afterwards increased to \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), passed to the British on the fall of the Peshwa in 1817. In 1780, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r imposed a tribute of \u00a3336 (Baroda Rs. 4000), and this sum was permanently fixed in 1813 at the settlement of the affairs of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha tributaries at Baroda Rs. 4001 and since commuted to \u00a3360 (Rs. 3601-2-7).\n\nIn 1820 on Sal\u00e1b\u00e1t Kh\u00e1n\u2019s death the succession was claimed by his kinsman the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gad. This claim was disallowed, and Ab\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, Sal\u00e1b\u00e1t\u2019s cousin and adopted son, was raised to the chiefship, and the British opium regulations introduced into his state. Ab\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n was only a boy, and as his state was seriously mismanaged, he was in 1822 removed in favour of his elder brother Idal Kh\u00e1n. After ruling nine years, Idal Kh\u00e1n was, in 1831, succeeded by his son Jor\u00e1var Kh\u00e1n. The disputed claims of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor and Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da on Virpur continued to cause much annoyance, and in 1852, that both claimants might be under the same authority, the supervision of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor was transferred from Kaira to the Rewa K\u00e1ntha. As the contending parties would hear of\n\n---\n\n1 Compiled chiefly from Major Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t.\n2 During the time of this Naw\u00e1b, Arjunsing of Gad a vassal of the B\u00e1nsv\u00e1da chief, levied contribution.

At last when, in 1867, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da came under direct management, the whole Virpur question was inquired into, and as it was found that the B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor rights were much more important than those of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, the sub-division was handed over to B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da being relieved of a tribute of \u00a3247 (Rs. 2470).\n\nThe present Naw\u00e1b Jor\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n is (1879) fifty-three years of age. He has a brother Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n and three living wives, Bibi Sard\u00e1r Bakta, daughter of his uncle Ab\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n; Ch\u00e1nd Bibi, the daughter of a Gh\u00e1nchi of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor; and Gajinbax of Baroda. He has two sons, Manovar Kh\u00e1n born in 1847, and Budhu Mia born in 1870, and a daughter Dosi Bibi born in 1865. He is a chief of the second class, and is entitled to a salute of nine guns. He pays a tribute of \u00a31108 (Rs. 11,080) to the British, and of \u00a3360 (Rs. 3600) to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r Government.\n\nThe following is the B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor family tree:\n\n(I.) Sher Kh\u00e1n  \n(the son of Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, the grandson of Sher Kh\u00e1n I.)  \n(died 1758).\n\n(II.) Sard\u00e1r Muhammad.\n\n(III.)

The twenty-seven Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s estates, much mixed among themselves and with Baroda villages, may be roughly brought under eight groups, seven of them Rajput, and one Musalm\u00e1n. The Musalm\u00e1n group, P\u00e1ntl\u00e1vdi, has five villages, with an area of five square miles, and a yearly revenue of \u00a3500. The following are the chief available details of the Rajput groups.\nThe district is for the most part open, only a small portion in the south-east being hilly and covered with forest. It is crossed by several rivers. Besides the Narbada which forms its boundary on the south-east and south-west, there is, in the north, the Or or Orsang, and through the centre, flowing from east to west, the Heran, Asvan, and Men. Besides a few hills in the south-east on the bank of the Narbada, a forest-clad range, from 250 to 300 feet high and about four miles long, runs through the Nasv\u00e1di estate, parallel to the course of the Asvan. Except in Gad, Pal\u00e1sni, and a few other hilly and forest covered tracts, the climate of the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s is on the whole healthy. There are three kinds of soil, alluvial, light, and black.\n\nThe 1872 census showed a total population of 46,966 souls or 150\u00b75 to the square mile. Of the whole number 44,883 or 95\u00b757 per cent were Hindus; 2066 or 4\u00b740 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns; and 17 P\u00e1rsis. Of the Hindus 528 were classed as Br\u00e1hmans; 4843 as Kshatris, Rajputs; 733 as Vaishas, traders and merchants; 5586 as Shudras, cultivators, craftsmen, labourers, and depressed classes; and 33,193 as unsettled tribes, including 12,595 Bhils, 11,925 Dh\u00e1nk\u00e1s, 8043 Kolis, 496 N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s, and 134 V\u00e1lvis.\n\nOf the 44,883 Hindus 850 were Vaishnavs, 38 of them R\u00e1m\u00e1nujs, 26 Virvaishnavs, 779 Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1ris, and 7 Kabirpanthis; 545 were Shaivs; 60 Shr\u00e1vaks; and 43,430 belonged to no special sect.\nOf the Musalm\u00e1ns 2017 were Sunnis and 49 Shi\u00e1s. Of these 8 were Syeds, 115 Shaikhs, 100 Path\u00e1ns, 52 Bohor\u00e1s, and 1791 'Others.' The 17 P\u00e1rs\u00eds were Shahansh\u00e1is. There were 326 villages, or 0\u00b775 to the square mile, with, on an average, 144 persons to each village. Of the whole number, 254 had less than 200 inhabitants, 60 from 200 to 500, 8 from 500 to 1000, and four from 1000 to 2000. There were 9674 houses and 9468 enclosures, giving an average of 22\u00b742 houses, and 21\u00b794 enclosures, khadkis, to the square mile, 4\u00b785 persons to each house, and 4\u00b796 to each enclosure. Of the houses 807, inhabited by 5101 persons, were of the better, and 8867 with 41,865 inhabitants of the poorer, sort.\n\nOf the twenty-seven Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s estates the following are the chief available details. The Choh\u00e1n group of eight estates are M\u00e1ndva, Shanor, Agar, Sindi\u00e1pura, Devalia, Vanm\u00e1la, Alva, and Gad. Ma'ndva, in the west, is bounded on the north by Shanor, on the east and west by Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r territory, and on the south by the Narbada. It has sixteen villages with an area of sixteen and a half square miles, and an estimated yearly revenue of about \u00a32900 (Rs. 29,000), about \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000) from the estate, and the rest from outlying lands in Baroda territory. It pays the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3221 10s. (Rs. 2215). The soil is chiefly a rich black loam yielding cotton, millet, sesamum, sugarcane, and other valuable crops. The bulk of the people are Kanbis and Rajputs. Stretching into the rich Gujar\u00e1t plain, M\u00e1ndva, suffered much from Mar\u00e1tha encroachment. The right of the M\u00e1ndva chief to share both in the revenues and lands of Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r villages shows that his power once stretched nearly as far as the city of Baroda. But long before the present century, its power had been reduced by the separation of the Shanor villages. M\u00e1ndva, at the meeting of the Narbada and Orsang, is held in much esteem as a place of pilgrimage. In consequence of the indebtedness of the R\u00e1na, this estate was, between 1867 and 1879, under the direct management of the Political Agent. To the north of M\u00e1ndva, divided north and south into two nearly equal parts by the Orsang, the six villages of the Shanor estate have an estimated area of 11\u00bd square miles, and a yearly revenue of about \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). It pays the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3157 16s. (Rs. 1578). East of the river, the land is rather wild and rough, but to the west it is rich, yielding cotton, millet, oil seeds, sugarcane, and rice. The estate belongs to a younger branch of the M\u00e1ndva family. Agar, bounded on the north and east by Vanm\u00e1la, on the south by K\u00e1msoli, and on the west by Vajiria, is near the centre of the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s. Its twenty-eight villages with an area of seventeen square miles, yield an average yearly revenue of about \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). It pays the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a318 12s. (Rs. 186). The soil is partly black loam and partly sandy. It yields cotton, millet, oilseeds, rice, and gram. Most of the people are Bhils, and the tillage is careless and backward. Though still one of the largest of the Sankheda estates, Agar has lost much by the allotment to younger sons of the estates of Vanm\u00e1la and Sindi\u00e1pura, and, by the mortgage of many villages, to the Virpur chief. On the high road, half-way between Agar and Vajiria,\nare the ruins of the fort of Kukrej, according to local story a place of very great antiquity. Sindia'pura, like Vanmala the portion of a cadet of the Agar house, has two separate parts, one surrounded by the lands of the parent state of Agar, and the other between Vanmala and Nasvadi. It has four villages with an area of four square miles, and a yearly revenue of about \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000). It pays the Gaikwar a yearly tribute of \u00a35 14s. (Rs. 57). The estate has been under direct management since 1870. The village of Devalia, one mile in extent, held by a cadet of the Agar house, pays no tribute. Vanma'la, held by cadets of the Agar house, is bounded on the north by Gaikwar villages, on the east by Sindiapura, on the south by the estate of Agar, and on the west by Vora. Its eleven villages have an area of ten and a half square miles, and a yearly revenue of about \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000). It pays the Gaikwar a yearly tribute of \u00a313 6s. (Rs. 133). Except a few isolated limestone hills, the surface is generally flat, and the soil good. Its people are Bhils, lazy and unskilled, leaving much of the estate under grass and brushwood, and, only near their hamlets, growing patches of the coarser grains. In consequence of the heavy indebtedness of the Thakor, the estate has, since 1877, been taken under direct management. The Alva estate of eleven villages, bounded on the north and south by Virpur and Pantlavi, on the east by Gaikwar villages and Pantlavi, and on the west by the village of Devalia, has an area of five square miles, and a yearly revenue of about \u00a3550 (Rs. 5500). It pays the Gaikwar a yearly tribute of \u00a36 14s. (Rs. 67). Most of the people are Bhils, rude and unskilled husbandmen. The chief crops are millet, rice, gram, and oil-seeds. In consequence of the death of the Thakor, Alva was in 1878 taken under the direct management of the Political Agent. Gad, in the extreme south-east, is bounded on the north and east by Chhota Udepur, on the south by the Narbada separating it from Khandesh, and on the west by the estates of Palasi and Virpur, by part of the Tilakvada sub-division, and Gardeshvar in Rajpipla. Including 103 villages, thirty-nine of them assigned to the chief cadets, this estate, the largest in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, has an area of 128 square miles, and an estimated yearly revenue of about \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000). Through the Political Agent it pays the Chhota Udepur chief a yearly tribute of \u00a347 10s. (Rs. 475). North of the Men the land is fairly flat and open. But to the south it grows gradually rockier and more thickly wooded till, near the Narbada, it is, except on foot, impassable. The cultivators, almost all Bhils, are idle and unskilled. The chief products are, in the rainy season bajri, mag, banti, kodra, rice and tuver in small quantities, and, in the cold weather, gram. The Thakor, a Chohan Rajput, represents a younger branch of the Chhota Udepur house. The date of the establishment of Gad as a separate family is not known. Their poverty and the wildness of their country probably saved them from Musalm\u00e1n conquest. The people are in every way most primitive. The chief used to live\n\n---\n\n1 See below, p. 162.\nas a common villager at Gad in the wild country south of the Men. He has lately moved north to Bori\u00e1d, and built a larger and more suitable house.\n\nThe seven R\u00e1thod estates form two groups, Vajiria and Chor\u00e1ngla. In the west, on the south bank of the Heran river, lies Vajiria with its five branches, N\u00e1ng\u00e1m, V\u00e1san, Bihora, Dudhpur, and Vora. With five of its villages entirely, and a sixth all but surrounded by G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory, the main body of the Vajiria estate is girt and mixed with the lands of its five branches. Its twenty-two villages have an area of twenty-one square miles, and a yearly revenue, including land and money rights in G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory, of about \u00a32700 (Rs. 27,000). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3500 14s. (Rs. 5007). In the north-west, near the village of Vajiria, is a cluster of hills covered with forest and broken by water-courses. Most of the rest, though seamed with ravines, is level. In the west the soil is a rich black loam yielding all the more valuable crops, cotton, oil-seeds, millet, rice, and gram; towards the east the lighter soil yields only such inferior crops as v\u00e1l, mag, and kodra. Before the sub-division reduced it to its present size, Vajiria was a large estate, separating the Choh\u00e1ns of M\u00e1ndva and Shanor from those of Agar and Vanm\u00e1la. In consequence of the imbecility of the Th\u00e1kor, this estate has, since 1866, been under the direct management of the Political Agent. Of the five branches of the old Vajiria estate, Na'nga'm is bounded on the north by Vajiria, on the east by Nalia and Chudesar, on the south by the Narbada, and on the west by some G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r villages. Its four villages, divided among four shareholders, have an area of three square miles and an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3129 8s. (Rs. 1294). The estate is very poor, the shareholders little more than common husbandmen. The people are chiefly Bhils raising only the coarser and more easily grown crops. The date of the establishment of N\u00e1ng\u00e1m as a separate estate is not known. Va'san, with seven villages divided into two groups, one on the north and the other on the west of Vajiria, has an area of five and a half square miles, and a yearly revenue of \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3115 2s. (Rs. 1151). The lands of both groups are much broken by ravines, and the tillage, almost entirely in the hands of Bhils, is poor and rude. The date of the establishment of V\u00e1san as a separate estate is not known. Bihora, originally part of Vajiria or its offshoots V\u00e1san and Vora, includes two villages, with an area of one and a quarter square miles, and an estimated yearly revenue of about \u00a380 (Rs. 800). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a35 2s. (Rs. 51). The proprietor is little more than a common husbandman. The Dudhpur estate of one village, originally a part either of Vajiria or of its offshoots V\u00e1san and Vora, has an area of three quarters of a square mile, and a yearly revenue of about \u00a330 (Rs. 300). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a33 10s. (Rs. 35). The proprietor is little more than a common husbandman. Vora, with four villages, divided into two groups by the lands of V\u00e1san, has an area of three and a quarter miles, and an estimated yearly revenue of about \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a385 4s. (Rs. 852). As the\ncountry is much broken by ravines, the tillage area is small. The estate is well managed, and Vora, the Th\u00e1kor's head-quarters, is a place of some trade with several V\u00e1nia families. The date of the establishment of Vora as a separate estate is not known. In consequence of the death of the Th\u00e1kor in 1879, the estate has been taken under direct management. Cut off from the rest of the Mehv\u00e1s, in G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory some miles north of Vanm\u00e1la and Nasv\u00e1di, is Chora'ngla, the second main R\u00e1thod estate. Its seventeen villages, with an area of sixteen square miles, are divided into six shares, Chor\u00e1ngla with eight villages, Deroli with one, Vardle with two, Sarsauda with three, and Timbi with two, and to the east Ghelpur, a detached village on the border line between G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and Chhota Udepur territories. The total estimated yearly revenue of all the shares is \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000), and the yearly tribute to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r \u00a39 10s. (Rs. 95). Throughout, the land is much broken with ravines and water-courses. The crops grown are millet, cotton, pulse, castor-seed, rice, and gram. There are a few Kanbis and Rajputs, but the bulk of the people are Kolis.\n\nThe two Ch\u00e1vda Rajput estates of Bhilodia and R\u00e1mpura lie north-west of the R\u00e1thod villages. Bhilodia, bounded on the north by the R\u00e1mpura estate, on the west by the R\u00e1thod estates of Vajiria, Vora, and Bihora, and on the south and west by G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory, is equally divided between two shareholders. Its eleven villages have an area of nine square miles, and an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a3900 (Rs. 9000). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3242 12s. (Rs. 2426). The land is much broken by ravines. But the soil is mostly a rich black loam yielding the better class of crops, cotton, millet, oil-seeds, sugarcane, and rice. R\u00e1mpura, an offshoot of the Bhilodia estate, bounded on the north-east and west by G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory and on the south by Bhilodia, is divided among three shareholders. Its four villages have an area of four and a half square miles, and an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a3350 (Rs. 3500). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3142 4s. (Rs. 1422). As in Bhilodia the soil is rich and yields the better kinds of crops.\n\nSouth of the Choh\u00e1n estates of Alva and Agar, between the Asvan and the Men near the town of Tilakv\u00e1da, is a settlement of Gori Rajputs, now divided into the three estates of Jir\u00e1l K\u00e1msoli, Chudesar, and Nalia. The eight and a half miles over which these estates extend, though of rich soil are much broken by ravines, and the people are very poor growing only the coarser grains. Of the three estates, Jir\u00e1l K\u00e1msoli, divided among three shareholders, has ten villages, with an area of five square miles, and an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a3340 (Rs. 3400). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a333 6s. (Rs. 333). In consequence of disputes among shareholders it has been under direct management since 1870. Chudesar, divided among two chiefs and fourteen under-shareholders, has four villages with an area of two and a half square miles, and an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a381 10s. (Rs. 815). It pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a331 2s. (Rs. 311). It has been under direct management since 1870. Nalia, a single village, divided\nbetween two shareholders, is one square mile in area, and has an estimated yearly revenue of about \u00a360 (Rs. 600). It pays the Gaikwar a yearly tribute of \u00a33 14s. (Rs. 37).\n\nSouth of the Gori settlement, beyond the river Men, is the Daima Rajput estate of Uchad now divided into four parts, Virpur, Regan, Virampura, and Uchad, covering between them an area of 26 square miles. The Virpur estate, originally including only the villages of Virpur and Vasa near Uchad on the Narbada, was early in the present century greatly added to by its chief Baji Daima. This man, a noted freebooter, gave himself up at the time of settlement in 1825. He was then confirmed in his estate, and having a keen eye for money-lending and other business, managed at the expense of his neighbours, the chiefs of Uchad, Agar, and Rajpipla, to increase his property to twenty-two villages, and made his family one of the largest landholders in the Sankheda Mehvas. The present Virpur estate covers an area of twelve and a half square miles and yields a yearly revenue of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), paying the Gaikwar a yearly tribute of \u00a335 12s. (Rs. 356). In the Agar part the soil is a rich black loam yielding millet, cotton, and oil-seeds. In the parts near Uchad the soil is lighter and the ground much broken by ravines and water-courses. Here millet is the chief crop, but cotton, oil-seeds, and, on the river banks, tobacco, are also grown. The Rajpipla villages, hilly and timber-covered, yield only scanty and coarse crops and the flowers and berries of the mahuda tree. Regan, a single village west of Uchad, with a good Narbada frontage, is divided among three shareholders. With an area of about four square miles, it yields an annual revenue of \u00a350 (Rs. 500), and pays the Gaikwar a yearly tribute of \u00a346 2s. (Rs. 461) leaving almost nothing to the proprietors. In soil, crops, and people, it does not differ from Uchad. Virampura, on the Men to the north-west of Uchad, has two villages with an area of one square mile and an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a370 (Rs. 700), paying the Gaikwar a yearly tribute of \u00a310 6s. (Rs. 103). The proprietor is little more than a common husbandman. The soil is partly black and partly light, growing crops of millet, tuver, and rice; the people are mostly Bhils. Ucha'd, the parent state, now brought down to twelve villages, has an area of eight and a half square miles and an estimated yearly revenue of about \u00a3900 (Rs. 9000). It pays the Gaikwar a yearly tribute of \u00a388 6s. (Rs. 883). The inhabitants are mostly Kolis growing the coarser crops.\n\nSolanki Group.\n\nTo the east of the Chohan estates of Agar, Vanmala, and Sindiapura, and bounded on the north and south by Gaikwar and on the east by Palasni territory, is Nasvadi the only Solanki estate in this part of the country. Its twenty-seven villages have an area of nineteen and a half square miles, and yield an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), paying the Gaikwar a yearly tribute of \u00a3109 2s. (Rs. 1091). The Asvan river divides the estate into two nearly equal parts, an open plain on the north but somewhat hilly and thick-wooded in the south. The soil is fairly rich, yielding crops of millet, cotton, rice, tuver, castor-seed, and gram.\n\nParmar Group.\n\nTo the east of Nasvadi and bounded on the north and south by Gaikwar villages, and on the east by the Gad estate, Palasni is the\nonly Parm\u00e1r estate in the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s. Its fourteen villages have an area of twelve square miles and yield an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000), paying the Gaikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a3213 2s. (Rs. 2131). Like Nasv\u00e1di its soil is fairly rich, and yields crops of the better grains. In consequence of the minority of its chief, it has, since 1864, been under the direct management of the Political Agent.\n\nThe P\u00e1ntl\u00e1vdi estate, on the southern border of the Mehv\u00e1s, contains two distinct groups, one of four villages, between the Alva and Vam\u00e1la estates, and the other of one village within the limits of the Amroli division of the Tilakv\u00e1da sub-division. The proprietors, called Kh\u00e1ns, are supposed to be the descendants of some military adventurer. But nothing is known of their origin or of the date of their gaining the estate. Its five villages have an area of five miles, and an estimated yearly revenue of about \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000). It is free from the payment of tribute. The soil is black, the chief crops rice, millet, tuver, and kodra, and the people mostly Kolis.\n\nIn the sacred hill of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad centre the family histories of the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s chiefs. Of the Th\u00e1kors or landed gentry, few can trace their families beyond the time, when a Choh\u00e1n prince reigned at Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, and drew the Rajput chivalry of eastern Gujar\u00e1t to defend the great stronghold of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad, when (1482-1484) threatened by the armies of Mahmud Sh\u00e1h Begada. The fall of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad forced the Rajput chiefs to retire to the difficult country between the rivers Orsang and Narbada. There would seem at first to have been eight chief families, a R\u00e1thod at Vajiria; Choh\u00e1ns at Agar, M\u00e1ndva and Gad; a D\u00e1ma at Uch\u00e1d; a Gori at Jir\u00e1l; a Solanki at Nasv\u00e1di, and a Parm\u00e1r at Pal\u00e1sni. Later on, pressed by the Musalm\u00e1ns, the chiefs of Vajiria, Agar, Uch\u00e1d, and Jir\u00e1l, embraced Isl\u00e1m, and became known as Moles\u00e1l\u00e1ms, while those of M\u00e1ndva, Nasv\u00e1di, Pal\u00e1sni, and Gad, kept their lands without changing their faith. In time the eight original families became sub-divided. Younger branches of the house of Vajiria, taking their shares of the family estates, established themselves at V\u00e1san, Vora, Nang\u00e1m, Dudhpur, and Bihora; in the same manner Vam\u00e1la and Sind\u00edapura separated from Agar; Shanor from M\u00e1ndva; Regan, Virp\u00far, and V\u00e1san from Uch\u00e1d; and Ch\u00fadesar and Nalia from Jir\u00e1l. Early in the eighteenth century, when Moghal authority was weakened and Mar\u00e1tha supremacy not established, the Sankheda chiefs were able to spread their power over the rich plain lands of Gujar\u00e1t enforcing tribute in land and money as far as the walls of Baroda. But they had no long respite, for the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, not content with recovering the chief part of the revenues of the plain villages, pressed the chiefs in their own lands, and by sending an armed force wrung from them the payment of a yearly tribute. When Baroda was in the hands of a strong ruler, the Sankheda chiefs were forced to pay a regular tribute and to refrain from disorder and plunder. But with a weak ruler at Baroda they burst out like a half-quenched fire, and became the terror of the country. In 1822 the chiefs were in rebellion, paying tribute only under the pressure of fire and sword,\nplundering villages, and stopping all trade highways. As it had become responsible for public peace in Gujar\u00e1t, the British Government determined that the unruly chiefs should be brought to order. The duty was entrusted to the Political Agent Mr. Willoughby, who, in three years, in spite of the rugged difficult country, hunted down and secured all the rebel chiefs, and arranged with the Gaikw\u00e1r to grant them terms that would ensure their future subsistence. In 1825 the petty chiefs engaged to live peaceably; to pay their dues regularly; to leave the settlement of the boundaries of their estates, and of their rights in Gaikw\u00e1r villages, to the British Government; and to give up all offenders who might take refuge in their lands.\n\nAt the same time (7th September 1825), the Gaikw\u00e1r, after recording what estates and villages should be included in the agreement, stipulated that the tribute of the larger estates should be paid through the British Government, and of the smaller through the local authorities; he confirmed the proprietors in their existing rights of every description; conceded that all boundary and other disputes should be settled through the medium of the Political Agent; acknowledged their independence in their own villages, and their rights of hereditary succession and adoption; and left their general control and management in the hands of the Political Agent.\n\nDuring the fifty years that have since passed the Mehv\u00e1si proprietors have given little trouble. They have ceased to be robbers and freebooters, paid their tribute regularly, and accepted the Political Agent's settlement of their boundary and succession disputes; they have spread tillage, and increased the resources of their estates. Among the rights guaranteed to the Sankheda chiefs by the Gaikw\u00e1r in 1825, one of the most important was that of holding share, v\u00e1nta, lands in Gaikw\u00e1r villages, and, under toda gir\u00e1s and other names, of recovering from them certain money dues. These rights were enjoyed without question, till in 1862, Khanderao Gaikw\u00e1r ordered a levy of one-eighth (2 annas in the rupee) from all holders of rentfree land and revenue claims. Against this order, the share, vanta, and allowance, toda gir\u00e1s, holders under the protection of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Agency appealed, and, after some discussion, the Baroda court admitted that the order could not apply to claims guaranteed by the 1825 settlement. The great question of the extent of the guaranteed claims was opened up, and a special officer has now for some time been employed in examining them.\n\nPa'ndu Mehva's. Except Umeta in the extreme west which stands on the right bank of the river, the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s estates, including Dorka, R\u00e1eka, and Anghad forming together the Dorka Mehv\u00e1s, stretch about fifty miles along the left bank of the Mahi in a narrow broken line. This belt of estates has an area of 187\u00bd square miles, an estimated population of 41,618 souls, and, during the five years ending 1878, an average yearly revenue of \u00a311,000 (Rs. 1,10,000). Except near the Mahi, where it is cut with ravines, the country is level. Besides the Mahi, that, flowing from north-\n\n---\n\n1 Some details have already been given p. 66.\neast to south-west, forms the northern boundary of all the estates except Umota, the river Karad divides Mevali into two nearly equal parts, and, in Jumkha, joins the Goma, which, flowing through Sihora and N\u00e1h\u00e1ra, forms the south boundary of Gotardi. The Mesri crossing Jesar, Chh\u00e1l\u00edar, Sihora, and N\u00e1h\u00e1ra, empties itself into the Mahi at the town of Sihora.\n\nThe climate is generally healthy and the soil light, yielding where well tilled, rich crops of millet, rice, and sugarcane.\n\nThe 1872 census showed a population of 41,618 souls or 303\u00b77 to the square mile. Of the whole number 40,095 or 96\u00b734 per cent were Hindus, and 1523 or 3\u00b766 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the Hindus, 909 were classed as Br\u00e1hmans; 2591 as Kshatris, Rajputs; 598 as Vaishas, traders and merchants; 32,382 as Sh\u00fadras, cultivators, craftsmen, labourers, and depressed classes; and 3615 unsettled classes, including 235 Bhils and 3380 Kolis. Of the 40,095 Hindus 1225 were Vaishnavs, 9661 R\u00e1manujs, 37 Sv\u00e1min\u00e1r\u00e1yans, 721 Vallabhb\u00e1h\u00e1r\u00eds, and 2612 Kabirpanthis; 1895 were Shaivs; 107 ascetics; 23,733 Unsectarian Hindus; and 104 Shravaks. Of the Musalm\u00e1ns 16 were Syeds, 49 Shaikhs, 216 Path\u00e1ns, 3 Memans, 68 Bohor\u00e1s, 15 Makr\u00e1nis, and 1156 were entered as \u2018Others.\u2019 Of the whole number 1491 were Sunnis and 32 Shi\u00e1s.\n\nThe number of villages was 154 or 0\u00b77 villages to the square mile, and the average village population 270. Of the whole number 105 villages had less than 200 inhabitants, 31 from 200 to 500, 9 from 500 to 1000, 6 from 1000 to 2000, 2 from 2000 to 3000, and one the town of Bh\u00e1darva, between 3000 and 5000 inhabitants. The houses numbered 10,350 giving an average of 49\u00b77 houses to each square mile, and 4 persons to each house. Of the total number of houses 2493 inhabited by 9559 persons were of the better, and 7857 with 32,059 inhabitants of the poorer, sort.\n\nThe estates bordering on the river Mahi are twenty-six in number, and though they only cover 137\u00bd square miles, their river frontage stretches along fifty-eight miles. In former times the Kolis owned all the land in the Mahi valley, and were gradually ousted by various Rajput tribes. Some estates in the Mehv\u00e1s are still held by Koli proprietors and others by B\u00e1riy\u00e1s, who claim a part Rajput descent, probably from discontented chiefs who had \u2018gone out\u2019 in revolt, and had married the daughters of some of their Koli supporters. According to the common phrase, they took water from a Bhil and so lost caste. The P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s states form four groups, one owned by Kolis; one by B\u00e1riy\u00e1s; one by Rajputs; and one by Muhammadans. There are seven Koli estates, single villages divided among a number of shareholders. The estate of Mevali is five miles in extent with one parent village and four hamlets. It is divided into four shares. The yearly income from all sources is \u00a3210 (Rs. 2100), and the tribute paid to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500). The part to the north of the Karad river is the richest, yielding crops of millet, cotton, oil-seeds, and sugarcane. The land to the south of the river is untilled growing only grass. It borders on the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s S\u00e1vli sub-division, of which it once formed a part.\nNorth of Mevali, and separated from it by Jumkha and N\u00e1h\u00e1ra, with the Goma river on the south and G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r land in the west, is Gotardi. Divided among four shareholders, this estate, of one village and three hamlets, is $1\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles in area, and yields a revenue of \u00a360 (Rs. 600), paying the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a342 10s. (Rs. 425). Between the P\u00e1ndu estate and some villages of K\u00e1lol in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, are the two small estates of Kasla Pagi, and Moka Pagina, Muv\u00e1da. These estates, each of one village, have a collective area of two square miles. The first, owned by five shareholders, has a yearly income of \u00a310 (Rs. 100), and pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a36 10s. (Rs. 65). The second, divided between two holders, has a yearly income of \u00a325 (Rs. 250), and pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a312 10s. (Rs. 125). The holders are poor, known as pagis or trackers, and in no way above common husbandmen.\n\nGothra on the Mahi, bounded on the south by G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, and on the north and east by Panch Mah\u00e1ls territory, is cut off from the rest of the Mehv\u00e1s. Divided among three Koli shareholders known as kotv\u00e1ls, it has an area of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, a yearly revenue of \u00a363 10s. (Rs. 635), and pays the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r a yearly tribute of \u00a320 2s. (Rs. 201). Though most of the land is covered with brushwood, the village has some importance from lying on the main road between Gujar\u00e1t and Malwa, and commanding one of the best of the Mahi fords. Besides the Koli proprietors, some Syeds of P\u00e1li on the other side of the Mahi, have a share in the village revenues. This estate is at present under direct management. Four miles south of Gothra is Jesar, bounded on the north by G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory, on the east by Panch Mah\u00e1ls villages, and on the south and west by villages of the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s. It has an area of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, a yearly revenue of \u00a340 (Rs. 400), shared between four joint owners, and pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a315 2s. (Rs. 151). Watered by the Mesri river the soil is good, and, were the owners less sunk in debt, could yield almost any crop.\n\nAnghad, the south-most village in the Mehv\u00e1s, lying on the Mahi is cut off from the other estates by G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r land. With an area of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, shared among six joint Koli owners, three of them called kotv\u00e1ls and three pagis, it yields a yearly revenue of about \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000), and pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a3175 9s. (Rs. 1754\u00bd). The soil is good, but the ground is much cut by ravines. A thrifty Kanbi population could in a short time double the revenue. The Anghad Kolis are notorious thieves. During the mutiny (1857-1859) time, they gave such trouble that their village was moved to a more open part of the country. One share of this estate is under direct management. This finishes the Koli group. All the villages are wretchedly poor, burdened by the tribute, and cut into such small shares that the hope of improvement is small.\n\nThe B\u00e1riya group includes seven estates, six of them close together in the heart of the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s, and the seventh and largest, Um\u00e9ta, in the extreme west. Of these the largest and probably the oldest is Shora. Divided into two by a strip of Amr\u00e1pur land, it has an area of $15\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles, containing 25 villages and hamlets yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000), and paying a yearly G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a3480 2s. (Rs. 4801). It is well watered, fronting the Mahi and crossed by the Mesri and\nGoma. The village of Sihora, the seat of the Th\u00e1kor who lives in some state, is at the meeting of the Mesri and Mahi. It is a busy little place with a large number of dyers and cotton printers. The estate is furrowed by ravines, and much of the land near the river is covered with brushwood. The tilled parts are rich, yielding cotton, rice, millet, and gram. In a corner, formed by the meeting of the Goma and the Mahi, between two parts of the Sihora estate to which it probably at first belonged, is Amra'pur. This, with an area of two square miles, a yearly revenue of \u00a338 12s. (Rs. 386), and a Gaikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a320 2s. (Rs. 201), is divided among four shareholders. The nature of the country and its crops are like those of Sihora.\n\nKanora, to the south of Sihora and probably once a part of that estate, has the Mahi on one side, and Gaikw\u00e1r territory on the other. Including Kanora, the estate, divided among eight shareholders, has seven villages, an area of 3\u00bd square miles, a yearly revenue of \u00a3220 (Rs. 2200), and pays a Gaikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a3160 2s. (Rs. 1601). Though the land is much cut by ravines there is an excellent Mahi frontage, yielding cotton, millet, rice, and gram. Varnol Mal bounded on the south and west by Gaikw\u00e1r land, lies between the estates of Mevali and Sihora, to the latter of which it probably once belonged. Divided between two shareholders, it covers an area of 3\u00bd square miles with, including Varnol Mal, five villages yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000), and paying a Gaikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a38 10s. (Rs. 85). This estate is chiefly grass land with patches of tillage close to the hamlets. Nahara, with Gotardi to the north and Mevali to the south, lies between Gaikw\u00e1r territory and Sihora, of which it is an offshoot. Divided into two parts by the Jumkha estate and shared by two owners, it has an area of three square miles with, including Nahara, five villages yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a360 (Rs. 600), and paying a Gaikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25). Watered by the rivers Goma and Mesri, its soil and crops are like those of Sihora. At the meeting of the Karad and Goma rivers, Jumkha, probably an offshoot from Sihora, has Nahara on the east and west, Gotardi on the north, and Mevali on the south. One square mile in area, it has two villages yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a340 (Rs. 400), and paying a Gaikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a35 2s. (Rs. 51). In soil and crops Jumkha is like Sihora. The above six estates are all in one cluster in the heart of the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s. The only remaining estate held by a Bariya proprietor is Umeta. On the Mahi, west of Baroda, formed of two groups of villages, one of five in Kaira, and the other of seven in Petl\u00e4d, this estate dates partly from the close of the fifteenth and partly from the close of the seventeenth century. According to their family accounts, Jh\u00e1njarji a Parihar Rajput, flying from Champ\u00e1ner at the time (1484) of its capture by Mahmud Begada, took refuge in the Mahi woods, and, drinking water from a Bhil, lost his caste. Soon afterwards, killing Jayasingji of Bilp\u00e1r, he received from the Bhetashi chief a gift of eight villages. About 200 years later (1694), the headman of Umeta, unable to save his village from Koli robbers, called for help to Jh\u00e1njarji's descendant, Dalpat sing, giving him four villages in reward. At the division (1751) between the Gaikw\u00e1r and the Peshwa, the Peshwa got five, and the Gaikw\u00e1r seven, villages. In 1812 and 1820 the Umeta Th\u00e1kor was classed among the Mahi\nK\u00e1ntha tributaries, and his tribute fixed at \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) to the British, and \u00a3255 4s. (Rs. 2552) to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. The group of seven villages, in a broad bend of the Mahi, covers an area of twenty-one miles, and yields a yearly revenue of \u00a31800 (Rs. 18,000). Its soil is light, and yields good crops of cotton, oil-seed, sugarcane, millet, and rice.\n\nIn the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s there are three chief Rajput estates, Bh\u00e1darva, Dhari, and R\u00e1eka. Bha\u2019darva, pleasantly placed on the left bank of the Mahi about the middle of the line of the Mehv\u00e1s estates, covering an area of twenty-seven square miles, with, including Bh\u00e1darva, thirteen villages, has a yearly revenue of \u00a33600 (Rs. 36,000), and pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a31907 12s. (Rs. 19,076). The soil is light and rich. Bh\u00e1darva, once a very large estate, has suffered from two causes. The Muhammadans and the Marsth\u00e1s have greatly reduced its size, leaving in thirty-three villages only a fourth, v\u00e1nta, in some of which the Bh\u00e1darva chief has husbandmen of his own and distinct civil and police powers. Again, of the villages that still form part of the estate, a large share of the land has, by the chief\u2019s carelessness, been granted away, or, without any proper title, allowed to be held as private land. Dhari, the northmost of the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s estates, surrounded by Panch Mah\u00e1ls territory, and divided among six shareholders, has seven villages with an area of 3\u00bd miles, a yearly income of \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000), and a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a395 2s. (Rs. 951). The soil good, though rocky in parts, yields millet and rice. R\u00e1\u2019eka, on the Mahi to the south of Bh\u00e1darva, has an area of 2\u00bd square miles, a yearly income of \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500), and pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200). Two-thirds of the estate belong to Solanki proprietors, and one-third to the Paged\u00e1r of Baroda to whom they sold it many years ago. The land is much cut by ravines running into the Mahi; but the soil is good, yielding crops of millet, rice, tobacco, sugarcane, and oil-seeds. Two shares of this estate are under direct management. The Choh\u00e1ns established themselves at Chha\u2019liar at a very early period. The original limits of the estate embraced Vakht\u00e1pur and R\u00e1jpar, which were subsequently assigned to cadets of the family. It now contains an area of eleven square miles with twenty-four subordinate villages and hamlets. It has a yearly income of \u00a31200 (Rs. 12,000), and pays a yearly G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a3340 2s. (Rs. 3401). Except for G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory on the north it is surrounded by other Mehv\u00e1s estates. The river Mesri runs through it. Close to Chh\u00e1liar, the land is rich and well tilled, though much broken by ravines. In the north-east it is poor, the husbandmen mostly Bhils, growing only inferior crops. Vakhta\u2019pur, to the north of Chh\u00e1liar and separated from it by the river Mesri, has two joint owners, an area of 1\u00bc miles, a yearly income of \u00a350 (Rs. 500), and pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a315 2s. (Rs. 151). Its soil and crops are like the poorer parts of Chh\u00e1liar. R\u00e1\u2019jar, on the Mahi to the north of Chh\u00e1liar of which it once formed part, has an area of 1\u00bd miles, a yearly income of \u00a337 10s. (Rs. 375), and pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a35 2s. (Rs. 51). It grows millet, rice, and tobacco. To the north of R\u00e1jpar lies the R\u00e1thod estate of Itva\u2019d with its offshoots Moti and N\u00e1ni Varnoli. With the Mahi on the west,\nItv\u00e1d has G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r villages on the north and east, and the two Varnolis on the south. Divided among four shareholders, it has an area of six square miles, with eleven villages, a yearly income of \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500), and pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a360 2s. (Rs. 601). But for want of capital its light soil could yield all the better crops.\n\nThe two Varnolis, big and little, moti and n\u00e1ni, about a square mile each in extent, lie between Itv\u00e1d and R\u00e1jpar. Their income is respectively \u00a329 (Rs. 290) and \u00a320 (Rs. 200), and the tribute they pay to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r \u00a310 2s. (Rs. 101), and \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25). There are two proprietors in Moti and one in N\u00e1ni Varnoli. The soil and products of both are like those of Itv\u00e1d. The estate of Poicha lies on the Mahi between Kanora and Bh\u00e1darva. Its area is 3\u00bd miles, and it has five dependent hamlets. Its yearly revenue is \u00a3210 (Rs. 2100), and it pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a3150 2s. (Rs. 1501). Of its six shareholders, five are V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s and one is a J\u00e1deja Rajput. Owing to heavy tribute arrears, they are miserably poor. As in other neighbouring estates the soil is rich but wants capital, and is much cut with ravines.\n\nThe last two estates are P\u00e1ndu and Dorka. P\u00e1ndu is bounded on the north and west by Chh\u00e1liar, on the south by G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r territory, and on the east by K\u00e1lol in the Panch Mah\u00e1s and by the small estates of Moka Pagi and Kasla Pagina Muv\u00e1da. Divided between two chief, and a number of under, sharers, Musalm\u00e1ns known as Khanz\u00e1d\u00e1s, it has an area of nine square miles, a yearly revenue of \u00a3520 (Rs. 5200), and pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a3450 (Rs. 4500). The soil is good, and, if the shareholders were not miserably poor, could yield all the best crops. All their available property sold and mortgaged, they have no capital to spend, and owe heavy tribute arrears. Half a share of P\u00e1ndu is under direct management. The small estate of Dorka lies on the Mahi between R\u00e1eka and Bh\u00e1darva. Divided among five Kanbi sharers, its one village has an area of 2\u00bd square miles, a yearly revenue of \u00a3240 (Rs. 2400), and pays a G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r tribute of \u00a3110 9s. (Rs. 1104 8 as.). The Kanbi owners have sunk to the level of village headmen, the revenue is collected by Government officials, and any surplus is spent for the general good of the village community. It is the seat of the Th\u00e1nd\u00e1r of Dorka Mehv\u00e1s.\n\nThe P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s, like other lands along this part of the Mahi\u2019s course, seems to have been originally peopled by Kolis. The Kolis say that they are sprung from Yauvan\u00e1shva, and remained for many generations on the sea shore in the delta of the Indus. At length by the goddess Hinglaj, under the leadership of Sonang Med, they were brought to the Nal. Sonang Med had twelve sons, each of whom founded a clan. The race gradually spread itself over Gujar\u00e1t settling, amongst other places, on the banks of the Mahi, whose rugged ravines suited them well, sheltering them from the punishment of their raids and robberies in the richer parts of the province. R\u00e1ja Karan Solanki (1064-1094) has the credit of being the first Rajput ruler who checked their thievish habits. His success was only for a time, and since then, whenever the central power\nhas been weak, the Mahi Kolis have burst out in their old excesses. Towards the close of the fifteenth century, apparently after the break up of their centre at Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, many of the Rajputs driven out of the richer lands, fell back on the rugged Mahi banks, and drove the Kolis out of their villages. Bh\u00e1darva and Dhari fell to the Solankis, Itv\u00e1d and Varnoli to the R\u00e1thods, and Chh\u00e1li\u00e1r to the Choh\u00e1ns. About the same time some Musalm\u00e1ns, calling themselves Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1d\u00e1s settled at P\u00e1ndu, and took four or five villages.\n\nAble to spread their power and harass the country during the decline of the Ahmedabad dynasty (1536-1583), they were again brought to order under the Moghals, and though troops had from time to time to be sent against them, their power in no way spread, till, early in the eighteenth century, the quarrels of its officers and Mar\u00e1tha attacks loosened Moghal rule. During the rest of the eighteenth century, all these communities, whether under Koli, Rajput, or Musalm\u00e1n leaders, attacking the rich Baroda plain villages, levied large tributes under some of the many forms of blackmail. The estate of Bh\u00e1darva, the two small estates of R\u00e1eka, Dorka, and Anghad, and the larger property of Um\u00e9ta in the west were, with other greater states, under the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r agreements of 1812 and 1820, placed under the protection of a British officer. The remaining estates were, under the convention of 1825, included among the tributaries placed under British protection. Under this agreement, estates, though only single villages divided among many shareholders, were allowed to hold the position of tributary chiefs, the amount of tribute being settled in consultation with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r officers. This assessment would seem in some cases to have been fixed at too high a sum. The estates have ever since been struggling with debt, and, compared with most of the country round, the district is miserably poor.\n\nKada'na, bounded on the north and east by the Meyw\u00e1r state of Dungarpur, on the south-east and south by the Rewa K\u00e1ntha state of Sunth, and on the south-west and west by Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, has an area of 130 square miles, with, in 1872, a population of 12,689 souls or 97\u00b76 to the square mile. During the five years ending 1878 it had an estimated average yearly revenue of about \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000).\n\nA round compact tract, Kad\u00e1na is rugged, covered throughout with hills and forests. In the south, near the town of Kad\u00e1na, the Mahi breaks through the range of hills that, in a curved line, crosses Sunth and Kad\u00e1na. On the west the Bhadar, and on the east the Suhna, small streams dry except during the rains, flow south into the Mahi. The Kad\u00e1na hills are of no great height, seldom more than six or seven hundred feet. Like the Sunth hills separated by narrow valleys, their forest-clad sides and rocky ridges, broken by very few passes, stretch north and south in parallel lines.\n\nThe climate is feverish and unhealthy. In the extreme south-west, on the left bank of the Mahi, the land is open and rich; but to the north, except a narrow fringe along the river bank, most of the country is barren and rocky.\nThe 1872 census showed a total population of 12,689 souls or 97\u00b76 to the square mile. Of the whole number 12,381 or 97\u00b758 per cent were Hindus, and 308 or 2\u00b742 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the Hindus 555 were classed as Br\u00e1hmans; 335 as Kshatris, Rajputs; 66 as Vaishas, traders and merchants; 2814 as Shudras, cultivators, craftsmen, labourers, and depressed classes; and of unsettled tribes, 8611 Bhils. Of the 12,381 Hindus, 54 were Vaishnavs, 2 of them R\u00e1m\u00e1nujis, 59 Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1ris, and three Kabirpanthis; 1753 were Shaivs; 8 Shravaks; and 10,556 belonged to no special sect. Of the 308 Musalm\u00e1ns 296 were Sunnis, 61 of them Syeds, 33 Shaikhs, 158 Path\u00e1ns, and 44 \u2018Others\u2019, and 12 were Shi\u00e1s, all of them Bohor\u00e1s. There were 100 villages or 0\u00b764 to the square mile, with, on an average, 126\u00b789 persons to each village. Of the whole number 79 had less than 200 inhabitants, 19 from 200 to 500, and 2 from 500 to 1000. There were 3002 houses or an average of 19\u00b725 to the square mile, and of 4\u00b720 persons to each house. Of the houses, 459 inhabited by 2205 persons were of the better, and 2543 with 10,484 inhabitants of the poorer, sort.\n\nAccording to the bards, Kad\u00e1na was, about the middle of the thirteenth century, established as a separate power by Limdevji, a younger brother of J\u00e1lamsing, a descendant of J\u00e1lamsing the founder of the town of Jh\u00e1lod in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. Since then in spite of its small size, the wildness and poverty of the country and the bravery of its Bhil inhabitants, have saved it from being swallowed up by its larger neighbours or from being forced to pay tribute to the paramount power. Except that it was always at war with Sunth, Dungarpur, or B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, nothing of the history of Kad\u00e1na is known till the accession of the present chief. Parvatsing was never on good terms with the late R\u00e1ja Bhav\u00e1nsing of Sunth. Bhav\u00e1nsing claimed sovereignty over him and in 1856 complained to the Political Agent that the Th\u00e1kor had introduced an infant into his house as his own son. The Th\u00e1kor admitted that the child was not his. He pleaded that it belonged to the family and that the other members of the bh\u00e1y\u00e1d were willing that it should be adopted as his heir. The R\u00e1ja of Sunth failed to prove that he had any power to interfere with the Kad\u00e1na chief. Under these circumstances Government allowed the Th\u00e1kor to adopt the child and declared his state independent of Sunth.\n\nSanjeli, an estate of twelve villages, in the north of B\u00e1riya, has an area of 33\u00bd miles, and in 1872, a population of 2532 souls or 74\u00b768 to the square mile. It is bounded on the north by Sunth, on the east by Jh\u00e1lod, on the south by B\u00e1riya, and on the west by Godhra. The land is fertile, but nearly all the people are Bhils and poor husbandmen. The villages are wide scattered, made up\n\n---\n\n1 According to the family bards the present chief is the twenty-first in succession. The names are: Limdevji; Madesing; Dharaji; Sult\u00e1nsing; Sh\u00e1rdulsing; Bhimsing; Kh\u00e1nsing; Bhojr\u00e1j; R\u00e1ghavd\u00e1s; Ashkaran; Surajmal; Limbji; Jagrupsing; Anupsing; Umcdsing; Dolatsing; Devising; Surajmal; Bhimsing; Vakhatsing; Parvatsing.\nof separate homesteads, surrounded by fields, and sometimes separated by forest lands. The staple grain is maize; millet, banti, pulse (mag, Phaseolus radiatus, and tuver, Cajanus indicus), and in the cold weather wheat and gram are also raised. The climate is generally unhealthy. The 1872 census showed a population of 2532 souls or 75\u00b758 to the square mile. Of the whole number 2484 or 98\u00b710 per cent were Hindus, and 48 or 1\u00b790 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. Of the Hindus 8 were classed as Br\u00e1hmans; 12 as Kshatris, Rajputs; 32 as Vaishas, traders and merchants; 62 as Shudras, cultivators, craftsmen, labourers and depressed classes; and 2370 as unsettled classes including 2130 Bhils, 224 Kolis, and 16 N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s. The number of villages was 41 or 1\u00b722 to the square mile; the average village population 61\u00b777. Of the whole number, 39 villages contained less than 200 inhabitants, and 2 had from 200 to 500. There were 713 houses or an average of 21\u00b728 to the square mile, and 3\u00b755 persons to each house. Of the houses 10 with 27 occupants were of the better, and 703 with 2505 occupants of the poorer, sort.\n\nThe Sanjeli family belongs to the clan of Songada Choh\u00e1ns. The founder of the house appears to be Satras\u00e1lji, who in some remote period emigrated from Meyw\u00e1r. As the present Th\u00e1kor is fortieth in descent from Satras\u00e1lji, a period of more than one thousand years must have elapsed since the settlement of these Rajputs in this part of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha. The bardic accounts state that Satras\u00e1lji reigned at R\u00e1jpur, a village near Kesarpur, now in the territory of the R\u00e1ja of B\u00e1riya, in 1159 (S. 1215) in the time of Shah\u00e1b-ud-din Gori. He and his successors claim to have held the northern districts of B\u00e1riya from the frontiers of Sunth to the river P\u00e1nam, and to have kept much of it till the time of Sard\u00e1rsingji, who was in 1789 killed by the B\u00e1riya chief. The son Bah\u00e1dur sing was taken by his mother to Jobat, where her father ruled. When he came of age, Bah\u00e1dur sing returned, and was slain in a fight against B\u00e1riya. He was succeeded by Jagatsingji, a notorious free-booter who was famous for a tuft of hair on his back like a tail. During his time, through the help of the British Government, the B\u00e1riya chief agreed to allow the Sanjeli chief to keep twelve villages within his own control and entirely free of B\u00e1riya. These villages are now in the undisputed possession of the Th\u00e1kor, and the boundaries of the estate having been lately defined, all pretence of interference on the part of B\u00e1riya has been removed. The chiefs of Sanjeli were known by the name of the forest chiefs, Jangli R\u00e1j\u00e1s. He died about 1858, and was succeeded by his adopted son Pr\u00e1t\u00e1psingji, the present Th\u00e1kor of Sanjeli.\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nAnamdera, in M\u00e1nse\u0142 in the south of R\u00e1jpipla, has a small mosque said to have been built to celebrate the birth of Shaikh Ahmad the saint of Sarkhej near Ahmedabad,\u00b9 and the friend and adviser of Sult\u00e1n Ahmad I. (1411-1443).\n\nBa'la'sinor, north latitude 22\u00b0 59', east longitude 73\u00b0 25', the chief town of the B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor state, with, in 1872, a population of 8836 souls, stands near the Shed\u00ed river, about forty-one miles east of Ahmedabad. Surrounded by a stone wall with flanking bastions and four gates, the town is ill placed, commanded by a high table land, and made hot and close by a wall of rocks that half encircles it. The town is of little interest, its main street narrow and winding with no noticeable buildings. Outside of the north gate is a large picturesque lake with a raised causeway running along its western edge, and, on the east bank, surrounded by trees, a summer house of the chief's. On the high ground to the north, overlooking the lake, stands the Naw\u00e1b's palace, a half fortified building four stories high, with turrets and a small flimsy-looking cupola perched on the top. From the town, a sudden rise leads to a massive gateway with flanking towers, and, beyond the gateway, a winding road passes to the palace plateau. Standing in a square court surrounded by stables, the building is mean and tawdry, its appearance marred by casual additions made from time to time as more room has been wanted. It is now seldom used by the Naw\u00e1b whose ordinary dwelling is in the garden house by the lake side. On a hill, called Dev Dungaria, about three miles (2 kos) from the town, a fair is held every year on Shr\u00e1van vad 8th (August) in honour of Dev Dungaria Mah\u00e1dev.\n\nBa'riya, or Devgad Ba'riya, north latitude 22\u00b0 42', east longitude 73\u00b0 51', the chief town of the B\u00e1riya state, with, in 1872, a population of 2891 souls, lies almost in the centre of the state, about half a mile\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 315. An account of the saint is given in the Bombay Gazetteer, IV, 291.\nfrom the P\u00e1nam river, in an angle formed by two lines of hills, one the Devgad hill, stretching towards the north, and the other, eastwards. The third side was enclosed by a wall by the late R\u00e1ja Prithir\u00e1j. The gorge, at the angle through which the drainage of the enclosed valley escapes, is closed by a gate. In the lower part of the town is a lately built jail surrounded by a garden. About the end of the eighteenth century (1785), the town seems to have been of considerable importance. It was a much frequented thoroughfare between Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa, the tolls levied at its gates generally exceeding \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) a year. It is described as neat, containing many brick-built and tile-roofed houses, with decent orderly inhabitants, well dressed shopkeepers, and clean soldier-like troops.\u00b9 Seen from the north or east, B\u00e1riya is a handsome town. In front, are a stone gateway and clock tower, and flanking walls stretching to the right and left; beyond, are the roofs of houses, and beyond the houses, some way up the Devgad hill, is the palace, its white walls standing out from the wooded background. The main street is broad and straight and the houses irregular and picturesque. The palace, built and included within the walls of the fort by the late R\u00e1ja, and lately improved by the addition of a garden, is a large rectangular three-storied structure with domed corner towers. From an inner courtyard, staircases lead to the different rooms. That on the left leads to the Darb\u00e1r room, large, with doors opening on a verandah, and with a grating overhead from which the ladies of the palace, themselves unseen, can look down upon the doings in Darb\u00e1r. Though somewhat badly aired and lighted and with steep troublesome staircases, the building has the merit of strength, congruity, and completeness. Though on the whole a handsome well built town, its position is low and unhealthy. On the south and west the hills shut out the breeze, and, on the high ground on the other side, not a quarter of a mile from the east gate of the town, a lake, as high as the roofs of the houses, fills the town with damp and fog. Of late years much has been done to keep the town clean and drain and metal its roads, and a dispensary has been opened with free medicines and advice. Still the townspeople suffer much from rheumatism and fever.\n\nOn Dasera day A'so sud 10th (September-October) about 6000 or 7000 Bhils, Kol\u00eds, and other lower classes, with a sprinkling of Br\u00e1hmans and V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, meet in B\u00e1riya to see the R\u00e1ja\u2019s procession, as he goes to worship the shami, Mimosa sum\u00e1, tree. All receive presents, the low caste people a pound each of Indian corn flour or of pulse, and the higher castes, all that is wanted to make a good meal.\u00b2 The people of the lower classes, dressed in their gayest, pass the day in drinking, dancing, and flute-playing.\u00b3 In former times, no one, even though accused of murder, could be arrested on Dasera.\n\n\u00b9 Forbes\u2019 Oriental Memoirs, III. 378, 380. Hamilton (1818) describes it as neat with many brick-built and tiled houses. Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I. 685.\n\u00b2 This, called pakk\u00e1 shikha or complete ration, includes, besides flour, rice and pulse, butter, oil, sugar or molasses, and spices,\n\u00b3\nPartly on the Devgad hill and partly on the plain, stands the Bariya fort, neither bastioned nor armed, about two and a quarter miles round, and with walls about ten feet high on the plain and six feet on the hill slopes. Behind the Raja's palace rises a hill about 600 feet high considered inaccessible and so not protected by walls. Within the fort are four unfailing wells. There are three main gates and one sallyport. The north gate is out of order, the east gate is in ruins, and the south gate in repair; the sallyport is on the west. On all sides the walls are ruinous. Even if in repair the fort is a place of no great strength. On the top of the Devgad hill, a small white building contains the tutelary deity of the Bariya house. The story is, that three generations after the fall of Champ\u00e1ner, when Dungarsing was looking for a site for his capital, one of his Bhils cutting wood on a hill struck his axe against two round stones. Blood gushed out and the axe was shivered. Hearing his story Dungarsing visited the spot, called it Devgad or God's fort, installed the stones as the tutelary deity of the hill, and founded his capital at its foot. The stones are still, with great pomp, visited by the Raja every twelfth year.\n\nBa'va'pir, a pass in the Rajpipla hills, takes its name from a celebrated Muhammadan saint buried there about 900 years ago.\u00b9\n\nCh\u00e1'nod,\u00b2 north latitude 21\u00b0 58', east longitude 73\u00b0 30', in the extreme west of the Sankhed\u00e1 Mehv\u00e1s, lies on the right bank of the Narbada, close to where it meets the Or, near the town of M\u00e1ndva, about thirty-five miles north-east of Broach. At this point, the banks of the river are so seamed by ravines from eighty to one hundred feet deep, that M\u00e1ndva and Ch\u00e1nod, though on two neighbouring knolls on the same side of the river are, in the rainy season, sometimes for days, completely separated. To remedy this evil, the towns have, within the last few years, been joined by a wooden bridge. From the north, wheeled vehicles can reach Ch\u00e1nod only by two roads, one the main road from Baroda through Dabhoi, and the other from Sinor, which join in a ravine about half a mile from the town. Up this ravine the road passes, steep and winding, to the plateau where the buildings of the town are somewhat closely huddled together. Even in the narrow crooked market street temples are mixed with shops, and the outskirts are reached only by narrow foot paths. Almost all the buildings are religious, temples, monasteries, and rest-houses. Devotees at all times fill the place, and, on high days, overflow from temples and rest-houses into booths, lanes, and streets. From the want of space, the ruggedness of the ground, and the division of ownership and authority between the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and the M\u00e1ndva chief, Ch\u00e1nod is at all times very hard to keep clean. At the great gatherings the dirt and smells, then always at their worst, greatly mar the effect of the high rugged temple-crowned banks, the broad deep river, and the shores and boats crowded with\n\n\u00b9 Forbes' Oriental Memoirs, II. 118.\n\u00b2 Lassen derives Ch\u00e1nod or Ch\u00e1ndod from the Sanskrit Chandrodaya, moon-rising.

The chief temples\\(^1\\) are those of Kapileshvar Mah\u00e1dev, K\u00e1shivishvan\u00e1th Mah\u00e1dev, Chandika M\u00e1ta, \u00c1dityeshvar Mah\u00e1dev, R\u00e1mchandraji Mah\u00e1dev, Shri M\u00e1ta Ver\u00e1i, Kamleshvar Mah\u00e1dev, Narmadeshvar Mah\u00e1dev, Shri Hanum\u00e1nji, and Shri M\u00e1rkandeshvar Mah\u00e1dev. Three flights of steps lead from the town to the bed of the river. On one of these, of very handsome cut stone still unfinished, the ex-G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r spent a sum of \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000).\n\nThe chief fair, held in honour of the image of Sheshash\u00e1i, lasts for five days from K\u00e1rtik sud 18th to v\u00e9d 2nd (November), the sud 15th being the chief day of the fair. It is attended by about 1200 pilgrims from all parts of Gujar\u00e1t, who bathe in the river and worship the image. Only articles of food worth about \u00a370 (Rs. 700) are sold. The police is managed by the R\u00e1na of M\u00e1ndva, who, in return, levies a small fee from the stallkeepers. Sheshash\u00e1i, well carved in black stone, is a four-handed Vishnu, sleeping on the back of the serpent Shesh or Anant, with his consort Lakshmi sitting by his feet, and the four-mouthed Brahma springing out of a lotus from his navel. The story, as given in the Narbada Pur\u00e1n, is that once a demon, doitya, becoming very powerful and troubling the gods, Brahma besought Vishnu to destroy him. Vishnu followed him to the Vindhya hills, and there with his discus slew him. But the demon had some Br\u00e1hman blood, the discus blackened, and Vishnu was guilty of Br\u00e1hman murder. On his way back, Vishnu, at Chakrap\u00e1ni \u00c1ro on the Narbada near Ch\u00e1nod, washed his discus and it came out pure. Thinking that the water would clear all sins, he stayed there and for many years slept on the waters. Long after, a Br\u00e1hman dreamed that Vishnu wished to leave the river, and, searching for him, found this black stone figure. A temple was built and the image installed, and is still served by the Br\u00e1hman's descendants. Additions have, from time to time, been made by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. The temple income is about \u00a3250 (Rs. 2500) a year, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r contributing \u00a3136 10s. (Rs. 1365), the R\u00e1na of M\u00e1ndva \u00a350 (Rs. 500), and the offerings of the pilgrims amounting to about \u00a370 (Rs. 700). After paying the charges, generally about \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000), the Br\u00e1hmans share the surplus. On Chaitra sud 15th (March), at the specially sacred meeting of the Narbada and Or, another great fair is attended by from 20,000 to 25,000 pilgrims from all parts of Gujar\u00e1t and even from M\u00e1lwa. Grain, sweetmeats, metal pots, and cloth, worth altogether from \u00a3400 to \u00a3500 (Rs. 4000 - 5000) are sold. The pilgrims bathe in the river, perform ceremonies for the souls of the dead, and worship at the temples round Ch\u00e1nod. It is specially famous as a place of cure in spirit diseases. People possessed by spirits come trembling from head to foot and, making an offering to N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, are freed from their tormentor.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In 1820 Hamilton found the chief temple finished in a style much superior to the generality of Hindu edifices, the central spire being light and in good proportion, and the dome interior forty feet in diameter, painted by Ahmedabad artists. All the temples abounded with exterior sculpture, but very inferior to that of Elephanta and C\u00e1rli. Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I. 712.\nThe legend of this place is, that once a prince of the Solar dynasty named Karnav, when out hunting, by accident shot a Br\u00e1hman. Sorely distressed, he set out to perform some penance, and sleeping under a banian tree, near the meeting of the Or and Narbada, woke to see the Br\u00e1hman he had shot pass by. Recognizing the man, he gave him all he had, and, on Chaitra sud 15th (March), washing and making ready a pyre, burnt himself on the river bank. His soul was wafted to heaven, and those who bathe there on that day are cleansed from all sins, even the sin of killing a Br\u00e1hman.\n\nDev Mogra, in R\u00e1jpipla, has a temple of P\u00e1ndhar M\u00e1ta. Every year on the Maha Shivr\u00e1tri day, M\u00e1g vad 14th (February), a fair is attended by about 200 pilgrims, mostly Bhils. During the two days it lasts the Bhils drink large quantities of liquor. Every year the chief of S\u00e1gb\u00e1ra sends to this temple thirty pots of liquor, a silver necklace worth about 2s. (Re. 1), 1s. (8. as.) worth of flowers, a girl\u2019s robe, hodhni, four goats, and one male buffalo. The food and drink are first offered to the goddess and then consumed by the worshippers.\n\nDhumkhal, in the east of R\u00e1jpipla, has, about two miles to the south, the remains of a few temples with fairly well-carved images.\u00b9\n\nHa\u2019mph, on the right bank of the Narbada, in the Chhota Udepur state, at the extreme south-east corner of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha, of local importance as a place of pilgrimage, has a ruined fort on a site of some strength, having the Narbada on the south and hills and ravines on other sides. This was the place of refuge, and for some time the head-quarters of the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner Choh\u00e1ns who are now represented by the Chhota Udepur chiefs. A road has lately (1875) been opened from Udepur. For the last eight miles it is little more than a bridle path.\n\nJeyor, in the N\u00e1ndod sub-division of R\u00e1jpipla, on the banks of the Narbada, has a stone and cement temple of Kumbheshvar Mah\u00e1dev, held in local esteem, from its mention in the Narbada Pur\u00e1n. The Br\u00e1hman who performs the worship is paid a yearly sum of \u00a340 (Rs. 400) by the R\u00e1jpipla state. His Highness the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r also contributes towards the expenses of the temple. Besides of Shiv, two images of small and large Panotis are worshipped with libations of oil. The offerings are shared by Tapodhan Br\u00e1hmans who worship the image of Shiv. On every Saturday in Shr\u00e1van (July - August) a fair is held, attended by about 300 people, from villages within a distance of about twenty-five miles, the number rising on the last Saturday, if the weather is fair, to about 2000. The people come in the morning, bathe, worship the image, and leave in the afternoon. A few Bohor\u00e1s, confectioners, betel-leaf sellers, and grocers open stalls and daily sell goods worth from about \u00a35 to \u00a370 (Rs. 50 - 700).\n\nKada\u2019na, the chief town of the Kad\u00e1na state, with, in 1872, a population of 1478 souls, lies about eighty miles east by north from\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel, XXIII, 315.\nAhmedabad, on a ridge that runs along the left bank of the Mahi shortly after it leaves the hills. The fortified house, or fort, where the Th\u00e1kor lives, stands on the extreme point of the spur that overlooks the town, but is commanded by hills both in front and rear. The walls are about ten feet high, and three quarters of a mile round. There are three small guns, but no bastions. The approach, up a winding bridle path through a gateway with flanking towers, leads into a narrow courtyard with out-houses along three sides, and the fourth filled by the Th\u00e1kor\u2019s dwelling. This building is two stories high. The basement is occupied by store and cook rooms, and in the upper story, reached by a ladder trap-door, are the Darb\u00e1r room, where the chief lives and receives guests and retainers, and the ladies\u2019 rooms, approached by a side passage. A winding stone staircase leads to a terraced roof.\n\nKukrej, between the towns of Agar and Vajiria in the centre of the Sankheda Mehy\u00e1s, has the ruins of an old fort. According to the local story this is the site of a large city, Kambavati Nagari, in Chohan days joined to Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner by an underground passage. Neither written records nor the size of the ruins supports these local legends. There is a story that near a masonry well much treasure was once hid, and that about forty years ago workmen, sent by the Agar chief to dig out the treasure, were driven away by winged serpents. In 1868 the place was again opened in presence of the Political Agent. After digging to some depth, a stratum of solid sandstone was reached, and as this did not appear to have been ever disturbed, no further search was made.\n\nLimodra, in R\u00e1jpipla, has a temple of Rikhavdevji. From an inscription on the footstool of the image, it appears to have been set up on M\u00e1rgshirsh sud 14th, S. 1120 (December 1064). The image was lost till 1864 (S. 1920), when it was found in a field in Limodra. The R\u00e1ja built a temple and placed the image in it on M\u00e1gh vad 5th, S. 1928 (February 1872). The expenses of the temple are defrayed from the rents of some houses and shops attached to it amounting to \u00a315 (Rs. 150) a year, and the offerings of the Jain devotees who flock there every year on K\u00e1rtik sud 15th (November) and M\u00e1gh vad 5th (February). The fair lasts for a day and is attended generally by not more than 150 pilgrims. The only trade is in grain sold for food to the amount of \u00a35 or \u00a36 (Rs. 50 - 60). An account of the Limodra carnelian mines\u00b9 is given above (p. 12).\n\n\u00b9 Barbosa (1514) (Stanley\u2019s Edition, 66) mentions that at Limadura was found a stone from which they made beads for East Africa (Berberia). Extracted in large blocks, it was white as milk with some red. Its colour was heightened by fire by great artists who pierced and manufactured the beads in various fashions, oval, octagonal, and round, and made knife-handles, buttons, and rings. Cambay merchants took them to sell in the Red Sea ports, whence, by way of Cairo and Alexandria, they went to Europe and throughout Arabia, Persia, and Nubia. Much chalcedony, which they called babagore, was also found in this town. Beads made of it and worn so as to touch the skin, were able, it was said, to preserve chastity. In 1666, Thevenot (Voyages, V. 37) mentions that at Cambay many agates were brought from a village called Nimodra on the Broach road. Writing in 1820, W. Hamilton says: The mines are situated\nLuna'va'da, north latitude 23\u00b0 8', east longitude 73\u00b0 37', with, in 1872, a population of 9662 souls, the chief town of the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da state, stands about four miles east of the meeting of the Mah\u00ed and P\u00e1nam, and sixty-three miles east from Ahmedabad. The town, founded in 1434 by R\u00e1na Bhimsingji, is backed by a hill about 300 feet high, which, gradually rising from the west, ends in a ridge running north and south with a very steep fall to the east.\n\nIn 1718, R\u00e1ja Narsingji greatly added to the strength of the place by building a wall, that, crowning the ridge, ran down the steep hill sides, and, turning inwards, met at the western or Mah\u00e1dev gate. The walls are from eight to ten and a half feet high and about two and a quarter miles round. There are ten or twelve ruined bastions, and four gates, to the north, east, south, and west. The R\u00e1ja's palace is in the fort. About the beginning of the present century, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da was a great trade centre for merchants passing from Ratl\u00e1mgad and other parts of M\u00e1lwa to Ahmedabad and central Gujar\u00e1t. The artisans were particularly skilful, and arms and other military accoutrements were easily procured. In 1803, it supplied Colonel Murray's army so effectually, that, had not the fortress of Dohad in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls been ceded without a struggle, he would have established his magazines and hospital at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da.\u00b9\n\nThe streets are crooked and narrow. The main street, winding through the market and the busiest quarter of the town from the V\u00e1sia gate in the north to the Darkoli gate in the south, is lined with houses, two or three stories high, many of them adorned with overhanging deeply carved wooden balconies. Built on the slope of a hill, the lower parts of the town, till lately when drains were built, suffered severely from flooding.\n\nThe palace, on a terrace at the top of a wall about forty feet high, looks from below very high and imposing. It is a long narrow building, with a solitary domed tower to the south, and a west front three or four stories high, full of irregular outstanding mullioned windows. The chief entrance passes through two gateways, and then rises sharply to the terrace on which the palace stands, where, through a third gateway, a courtyard is entered from which stairs lead to the different parts of the building. Except the Darb\u00e1r hall which has lately been added, the rooms are small and dark, and the staircases steep and difficult. Immediately behind the palace terrace, rises a covered way leading to its crest, a way of escape for the inmates\n\n\u00b9 Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, 684.\nof the palace, should they at any time be hard pressed. At the foot of the palace wall is a pleasant garden. Opposite it is the jail, and, immediately outside the gate, are the school and dispensary.\n\nOutside the south gate are the shrines of the gods Luneshvar, Vishveshvar, Ranchhodji, and the monastery of N\u00e1th B\u00e1va. The monastery is surrounded by a loopholed quadrangular wall with flanking towers, and, if it were not commanded by the town walls, would be a place of some strength. It was founded, in 1756 (S. 1812), by a Gos\u00e1i named Manhord\u00e1s, who is said to have suddenly appeared at Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and to have worked many miracles by the help of his patroness the goddess Annapurna.\n\nOn the P\u00e1nam river, at a short distance from Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, are held two fairs, one on Shr\u00e1van vad 8th (August) at the temple of Mehloia Mah\u00e1dev, and the other on M\u00e1gadh vad 14th (February) at the temple of Kum\u00e1reshvar Mah\u00e1dev. They are attended by 4000 or 5000 people, from Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and the Bhil and Koli villages round, who pay the Br\u00e1hmans \u00bd d. (\u00bd anna) a head. Only dry dates, coconuts, and other articles of food are sold.\n\nMa'kni, nine miles north-east of Sankheda, in a rich country with specially fine trees and surrounded by fields of sugarcane, seems to be the Mangni which Sult\u00e1n Ahmad I. fortified in 1419. It has a fine large lake, with a brick and cement wall on the south-west, and was evidently once a most thriving and populous place.\n\nMa'ndva, in the estate of the same name, in the extreme west of the Sankheda Mehv\u00e1s, stands on a high knoll overlooking the Orsang river at its meeting with the Narbada. It is separated from the town of Ch\u00e1nod by a deep ravine lately bridged over. The plateau on which the town stands is high above the river Orsang, and its edge, abutting on the river, is, during the rains, liable to be eaten away by the violence of the stream, and, as the ravines round the town have eaten deeply into the earth, there is constant danger of the whole or a part of the knoll being carried away. Except through the ravine no wheeled vehicles can approach the town. The only building of any pretension is the residence of the chief. Remains of bastions and flanking towers show that once, probably before the spread of the G\u00e1ikwar's power, the family was much richer and more prosperous than it now is.\n\nMohan, or Ali Mohan, about twenty miles south of Udepur, was, during the seventeenth century, the capital of the family of the present Chhota Udepur chief. After losing Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner (1484), they fled to H\u00e1mp on the Narbada, and seem, about the middle of the sixteenth century, to have moved to Ali Mohan as a place more likely to attract trade. The ruins of the fort stand on a conical hill, from 200 to 300 feet above the plain. Below it a line of circumvallation includes what must once have been the town. The plain is strewn\n\n---\n\n1 Watson's Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, 35.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII, 98.\n3 See above p. 159.\nwith the ruins of houses, gateways, and wells. The only remains are two broken-down round towers.\n\n**Mokhdi Gha'nta**, in R\u00e1jpipla, has about four miles off, on a high bank of the Narbada, two very old temples, one of Shulp\u00e1nishvar Mah\u00e1dev or the trident-bearing god,\\(^1\\) the other of Ranchhodji. For their support, the Baroda state pays \u00a370 (Rs. 700) a year, and the offerings of the pilgrims come to about \u00a310 (Rs. 100) more. R\u00e1jpipla pays about \u00a330 (Rs. 300) for the maintenance of the temple of Ranchhodji and the feeding of those who visit all the holy places on the Narbada. Here, every year, on Chaitra vad 30th (April) a fair is held. Pilgrims from all parts of Gujar\u00e1t begin to gather from Chaitra vad 11th, till, on the fair day, the number reaches about 4000. Beyond sweetmeats and food there is little trade.\n\n**Mota Sa'ja**, in the Jhagadia sub-division of R\u00e1jpipla, has the temple of a saint named Dny\u00e1n\u00edji. The story is that Gorakhji, the well known disciple of the great ascetic Machhindar, in an interview with the reformer Kabir at Benares, asked him to give him divine knowledge, dny\u00e1n. Kabir replied, that, as he was a follower of Machhindar, he could not instruct him in his present life, but would do so in the next on the banks of the Narbada. Gorakhji accordingly abandoned this life, and was born again in the house of the R\u00e1ja of Jesalmir in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r in the person of Dny\u00e1n\u00edji. When eleven years old he visited Kabir at the kabir vad tree near Broach. Taught by the sage, Dny\u00e1n\u00edji settled in the village of S\u00e1ja, and built a temple of R\u00e1m and Lakshman. He died on Posh sud 11th (January), and every year on this day a fair is held in his honour. The fair lasts for thirteen or fourteen days, and is attended by 1000 or 1200 pilgrims, mostly religious beggars from Surat, Broach, Baroda, and the neighbouring districts. Bohor\u00e1s, cloth sellers, confectioners, brasiers, and grocers open a few shops, and goods worth about \u00a3250 (Rs. 2500) are sold. The pilgrims worship the footprints of Dny\u00e1n\u00edji. The expenses of this temple, amounting yearly to about \u00a370 or \u00a380 (Rs. 700 - 800), are met partly from land granted by the R\u00e1jpipla state which yields about \u00a340 (Rs. 400) a year, and partly from land in G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and British territories yielding nearly the same amount.\n\n**Na'ndod**, north latitude 21\u00b0 53', east longitude 73\u00b0 43', the chief town of the R\u00e1jpipla state, with, in 1872, a population 9768 souls, lies about thirty-two miles east by north from Surat, on a rising ground in a bend of the Karjan river about eight miles from the Narbada. Flowing almost due north till it reaches the south end of the town, the Karjan makes a sharp turn for about two miles to the south-west. It then bends to the north-west for nearly a mile, and from that suddenly swerves north-east until it reaches the north end of the town, and then, leaving the town, flows towards the north. Near the town the river is about 100 yards broad, but, except during the rains, it is easily fordable save at a few deep pools. Towards the east or back of the town the ground rises abruptly, and\n\n\\(^1\\) *Shul* a thorn or trident, *p\u00e1ni* hand, and *ishvar*, god.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces of Interest.\n\nNA'NDOD.\n\nslopes rapidly towards the west or front, where it is bounded by a hedge beyond which is low swampy ground, in the cold season used by the cultivators as a threshing floor. The space between the bend of the river and the town is laid out in gardens and rich fields.\n\nAs early as 1304, the Musalm\u00e1ns are said to have driven the N\u00e1ndod, or N\u00e1dot, chief from his capital, and made it the head-quarters of one of their districts, building a mosque and issuing coin. And from that time until 1830, the chief, though he had, since the fall of Muhammadan power (1730), recovered most of the district, never brought back his capital from R\u00e1jpipla to N\u00e1ndod. N\u00e1ndod has one main street running from north to south, with, on both sides, many three-storied brick and cement houses, their fronts covered with gaudy paintings and some of them with richly carved balconies and overhanging wood work. Formerly very winding, this street was, in 1868, after a fire, improved and widened chiefly south towards the palace. On both sides, behind the buildings of the main street, are wretched Bhil huts. At the south end of the town is the palace, a bare quadrangular three-storied building with four square flanking towers, in a large untidy enclosure, which is gradually being surrounded by a wall of cut stone. From the basement, which is given up to store rooms and guardrooms, a dark flight of narrow steps leads to the first floor, where the Darb\u00e1r or reception room, narrow low and lighted from doors leading into a front verandah, stretches nearly the whole length of the building. At the back of the reception room is a courtyard with rooms round it, flanked by suites of women's apartments. The south end of the palace stands on the steep, eighty feet high, bank of the Karjan river. Besides with vegetables, the market is well supplied with English piece goods, embroidered robes, brocades, coarse country cloth, grocery, spices, tobacco, opium, glass bangles, children's toys, sweetmeats, and hot pieces of fried meat, kab\u00e1bs. The trade is mostly local, imports of hardware, groceries and cloth, and exports of agricultural produce, honey, wax, wood, and bamboos. N\u00e1ndod is mentioned in 1855 as celebrated for its cutlery, sword-belts, and s\u00e1mbar skin pouches. Country, dungri, cloth and tape, p\u00e1t\u00ed, were woven by the Dheds.\u00b9\n\nPRATHAMPUR.\n\nPrathampur, about five miles south of Sunth, has a ruined mosque and minaret, one of the few remains of Musalm\u00e1n supremacy in this wild part of Gujar\u00e1t. No writing has been found either on the mosque or minaret. According to the local story Prathampur was the head-quarters of a Musalm\u00e1n ruler Pratham Sh\u00e1h, who, about the middle of the thirteenth century, was beaten and driven out by a certain R\u00e1na Sant.\n\nRA'JPIPLA.\n\nR\u00e1jpipla, in the beginning of the present century\u00b3 the capital of the R\u00e1jpipla state, is called new R\u00e1jpipla to distinguish it\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 323.\n\u00b2 Apparently from 1730 to about 1820. See Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 264.\n\u00b3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 318.\nfrom the village of Pipla also called *juna* or old Pipla, the original stronghold of the chiefs, where they lived till 1730.\n\nOld Pipla, on a spur of the Devs\u00e1tra hill, is almost inaccessible to anyone but a Bhil. No wheeled vehicles can get there, the road, for about eight miles (5 *k\u00e1s*), lying through a narrow gorge between high overhanging hills. In former times it was a safe retreat, when, if invaded, the chief blocked the path with wood and rubbish. There are still traces of the village, now inhabited only by a few Bhils.\\(^1\\) At R\u00e1jpipla there were two forts, one immediately behind old R\u00e1jpipla on the top of the Devs\u00e1tra hill about 2000 feet high,\\(^2\\) and the other at new R\u00e1jpipla. The old fort is almost inaccessible being approached by narrow footpaths, which, with a little trouble, could be made impassable even for infantry. The new fort, built about 1730 on the spur of a hill at the meeting of the Tarai and Karjan, is approached, along the bank of the Karjan, through two miles of a wild and beautiful mountain gorge. Both sides of the hills overhanging the stream are crowned by breastworks, and the road is rugged enough to make access to the fort very difficult. In front of the fort the *L\u00e1l Darv\u00e1ja*, a gateway with flanking towers, completely bars the road. Even after surmounting this, an invading force would be nearly a mile from the key of the position, and would have to fight its way through a rugged defile between heights and among rocks and bushes alive with Bhils. The fort, a square court with walls about ten feet high enclosing an area of eight acres (15 *bigh\u00e1s*), contains the palace, a paltry structure with flanking towers armed by a few pieces of miscellaneous artillery. Old associations endear the fort to the ruling family, and every year, as the great Dasera festival comes, the R\u00e1ja marches in state from his palace to the fort, and, by the slaughter of a male buffalo, wins the favour of the guardian of his house.\n\nRa'mpur, with, in 1872, a population of 2284 souls, lies about a mile to the east of Sunth at the meeting of the small rivers Chibota and Suki. The road between the two towns lies along the bed of the Chibota through a pass commanded by hills on either side. The town is modern and laid out with some regularity, with a broad centre street leading from a ford over the Chibota. On the left, soon after leaving the river, are the jail and a new market. A little further, on the right, are new state offices, and, on the crest of the hill, a new hospital. The trade and population of the place have of late years rapidly increased, and some of the merchants\u2019 houses are well built and adorned with fretted stone work.\n\nRatanpur, north latitude 21\u00b0 24\u2019, east longitude 73\u00b0 26\u2019, in the Rupnagar sub-division of R\u00e1jpipla, stands on the top of one of a series of small rounded hills, about fourteen miles above Broach. Here, in 1705, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s gained a most complete victory over\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom., Gov. Sel. XXIII. 264.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bom., Gov. Sel. XXIII. 323.\nthe imperial army under Safdar Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi and Nazar Ali Kh\u00e1n.\\footnote{Watson's Gujar\u00e1t, 87.}\n\nAt the foot of a hill, in an uncultivated tract, about five miles southwest of Ratanpur, and three miles east of the village of Limodra, commonly called Nimodra, are the celebrated carnelian mines. Formerly all the stones were burnt at Limodra, but, about 1850, two other establishments were opened, one at Sult\u00e1npur and the other at R\u00e1mpura.\\footnote{Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII, 269.} On the top of the hill above the mines is the tomb of B\u00e1wa Ghor. Of the origin of the tomb, the servant, muj\u00e1var, in charge gives the following account. A long time ago the goddess M\u00e1kh\u00e1n Devi lived on the hill and near her a lamp, fed by fifty pounds of butter, continually burned. So strong was the light, that the prophet Muhammad at Mecca asked Shaikh Ghori Siddi or B\u00e1wa Ghor to see whence the light came. On the coming of B\u00e1wa Ghor, M\u00e1kh\u00e1n Devi sank under the ground, and the saint settling there worked, and still works, miracles. Even a tiger obeys his orders, and, if his victim only calls on the saint\u2019s name, the tiger stops eating him. A fair is held every year on the 6th of the Muhammadan month of Rajjab, when, according to the season of the year, from 100 to 500 Muhammadan worshippers come from all parts of Gujar\u00e1t. The R\u00e1jpipla chief has granted lands yielding about \u00a320 15s. 6d. (Rs. 207 as. 12) a year to maintain this tomb. On the same hill, at a little distance from B\u00e1wa Ghor\u2019s tomb, are the tombs of B\u00e1wa Habash and M\u00e1\u00ed Meshra, the brothers of B\u00e1wa Ghor,\\footnote{This B\u00e1wa Ghor was an Abyssinian carnelian merchant. See above p. 12.} who, when twelve years had passed, came from Mecca to look after their brother. Near this tomb is a r\u00e1yam, Mimusops indica, tree, commonly resorted to as a tree of ordeal. Its intertwined branches form a loop, through which suspected persons are made to pass, the popular belief being that while shrinking and holding fast the guilty, the loop allows the innocent to pass through unhindered.\n\nSanja\u2019la, in the Jhagadia sub-division of R\u00e1jpipla, has a temple of Gum\u00e1ndev, or Hanum\u00e1n, held in high local esteem. The story, as told by the temple priests, is that many years ago the site was densely covered with forest. Gul\u00e1b\u00e1s, an ascetic, found an image hid in a thorn bush and raised a small shed over it and afterwards a stone and cement temple. In time money flowed in and round the temple large rest-houses, dharmsh\u00e1l\u00e1s, were built. On every Saturday in Shr\u00edv\u00e1n (July - August), people from the villages round come to worship the image pouring over it offerings of oil. The temple has a small reservoir, where the oil offered to the image is stored. The expenses of the temple, from \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 (Rs. 1000 - 1500) a year, are met from the rents about \u00a320 (Rs. 200) a year, of the village of M\u00e1lpur, some service land yielding about \u00a330 (Rs. 300) granted by the R\u00e1jpipla state, and from the sale of the oil offerings. On A\u2019so vad 14th (October) or K\u00e1li Chaudas every year a fair, attended by from 400 to 500 people, is held in honour of the image. Sweetmeat makers, grain parchers, and others open a few stalls where goods worth from \u00a35 to \u00a310 (Rs. 50 - 100) are sold.\nSunth, the head-quarters of the Sunth state, north latitude 23\u00b0 13', east longitude 78\u00b0 55', lies about eighty miles north-east of Ahmedabad, among the ranges of hills which cross the state from north to south. From the west, the road passes over three hilly ridges, and through several defiles and rocky valleys, to the narrow hollow, where, hemmed in by hills, lies the town of Sunth. A little to the left stands the palace, an irregular building partly of brick and partly of stone, of great length, with one wing four or five stories high surmounted by stone gables, and another less lofty with small domes and minarets. Between the wings is a modern white stucco building, out of keeping with the rest, which, though of no great age, looks like the home of a feudal chief. On the south side are the ladies' rooms, and, at the opposite end, over the entrance gateway is the reception room, lately finished with ornamental windows and slate balconies adorned with much fine tracery.\n\nBetween the palace and the hills which rise very steep, a space, enclosed by a wall with flanking towers, does duty as a fort, and runs along the crest of the hill for about 150 yards. About the centre of the wall a sallyport opens down a steep footpath to the other side of the hills. At the foot of the hill cluster a few humble buildings, the people all dependent on the chief. The approach to the palace is up a steep causeway, leading to a gateway with two flanking towers, and thence up a winding road.\n\nSurpa'n, on the Narbada in the extreme north-east of Rajpipla, is a place of great sanctity. Details of its temples are given under 'Mokhdi Ghanta' of which Surpan is another name.\n\nUdepur, north latitude 22\u00b0 20', east longitude 74\u00b0 1', the chief town of the Chhota Udepur state, lies in the centre of a broad waving plain where the Orsang river makes a sharp turn to the north-west. The southern flank of the town rests on the river, and its eastern front on a picturesque lake with well wooded banks. Beyond the lake, between a fine grove of mango trees and the river, is the plain where Tati Topi's army was routed by Brigadier Parke in December 1858. On the side of the lake, stands a rich Hindu temple, with a fantastically carved spire. Through the trees that fringe the lake, the town roofs may be seen, and, above them, the palace, a curious incongruous mixture of old and new styles. This building is in a large court-\n\n---\n\n1 The fort and town of Sunth stands three or four miles from the open country to the westward, from which it is separated by moderately high hills. The ruling chief in 1806 objected most strenuously to Sunth becoming a thoroughfare for commerce or armies, fearing a dissolution of his government. Hamilton's Description of Hindustan, I. 685.\n\n2 The slate from the river Valai near Sunth can be quarried in great slabs. It splits very fine and is worked into tracery like marble. The masons who designed and carved the traceries came from Meyw\u00e1r.\n\n3 The fort of Sunth crowns the western face of a high rocky hill, the lower walls commencing near the base. It is well built and contains a curiously constructed palace, the two together strong enough to resist native armies. Hamilton's Description of Hindustan, I. 685.\n\n4 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 315. As so many of his names were holy places, it seems probable that Ptolemy's (150) Sarbana on the Mahi, as it leaves the hills, is Surpan on the Narbada.\nyard, surrounded by half-finished brick ramparts and parapet walls. Through an inner court, a gateway leads to the palace entrance, and from there a narrow dark winding flight of steps rises to the reception room on the upper story, and a second flight to an upper terrace. Round the palace are a number of new houses built by the present chief, one for each of his sons. These houses are in marked contrast to the poverty-stricken appearance of the rest of the town, whose one street has but few good houses, and whose inhabitants, making little by trade or manufactures, are almost all dependents on the chief.\n\nVirpur, in the B\u00e1lasinor state, with, in 1872, a population of 1800 souls, stands on the B\u00e1vli river eight or nine miles west of Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da. It boasts a great age. Early in the thirteenth century (1225), this town was taken from the B\u00e1riya chief Viro by Virbhadra, great grandson of Dhaval, the founder of the Vy\u00e1ghrapalli, or V\u00e1ghela, branch of the Solankis. On the southern face of the town is a ruined fort. On the B\u00e1vli river, close to the town on the north, is the shrine of a Muhammadan saint called Dariy\u00e1isha, which is visited from afar and is the chief glory of the town. Wonderful legends are told of this saint, whose real name was Mirza Muham- mad, and who is said to have been descended in a direct line from Abb\u00e1s, the uncle of the Prophet. Muhammed, it is said, foretold that a descendant of Abb\u00e1s would work miracles in Gujar\u00e1t. One Kutub Muhammed, the third or fourth in descent from Abb\u00e1s, living in Shir\u00e1z in Persia, was working many miracles. His fame reached the ears of a Br\u00e1hman of the then flourishing town of K\u00e1ranta in Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da who was in sore straits, because his low caste ruler demanded his daughter in marriage. Seeking help from Kutub, the saint came to K\u00e1ranta, killed the chief, and established himself in his place. He was afterwards attacked by the B\u00e1riya chief of Virpur, but, by the help of some Rajput mercenaries and some Ahmedabad troops his assailant was utterly defeated. Kutub\u2019s grandson, Mirza Muhammed, also a miracle worker, is said to have gone with Mahmud Begada against Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner and by his advice to have greatly helped the siege. His tomb is a picturesque building with windows of quaint open tracery, under a huge tamarind tree on the banks of the B\u00e1vli. Round the tomb are many half-ruined houses of the saint\u2019s descendants who live in idleness on the villagers\u2019 charity. A fair is held at the saint\u2019s tomb every year on the night of the twelfth of Rabbi-ul-\u00c1khar. Large numbers of worshippers come, and, when the proper time comes, see the locked doors of the tomb burst open, flowers rise from the ground and strew the saint\u2019s grave, and the stream run butter instead of water.\n\n1 This B\u00e1vli or mad stream once followed the saint Mirza and ran with butter instead of water. Butter still runs on the fair day poured on, it is said, some way up the stream by the tomb servant.\nN\u00c1RUKOT.\nN\u00c1RUKOT.\n\nN\u00e1rukot, a petty state administered by the Agent to the Governor in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, with a total area of about 143 square miles, a population, in 1872, of 6837 souls or 47\u00b78 to the square mile, and, in the five years ending 1878, an average yearly revenue of \u00a3986 (Rs. 9860), lies in the south-east of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, surrounded by the Rewa K\u00e1ntha state of Chhota Udepur. The country is wild, covered with low hills and thick forests. There is a fair supply of water chiefly from ponds and wells whose number is gradually being increased.\u00b9 The state has a bad name for fever. But at J\u00e1mbaghoda, where the timber has been cleared, the climate has much improved. The average yearly rainfall is about thirty-seven inches.\n\nIn 1874 specimens of lead ore were obtained near the village of Jhab\u00e1n. But in the opinion of the Superintendent of the Geological Survey they were not rich enough to encourage further search. Except in some villages where are good groves of teak, the N\u00e1rukot forests have very few valuable trees. The inferior timber and firewood are, by the local Kolis and Na\u00edkd\u00e1s, sent to Baroda and Dabhoi under a permit system, a cart-load of timber paying 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd) and of fuel 6d. (4 annas).\n\nPeopled by Na\u00edkd\u00e1s and Kolis, the state had, in 1872, 6837 inhabitants. Of these 3466 or 50\u00b76 per cent were males and 3371 or 49\u00b74 per cent females.\n\nThe soil is capable of yielding a larger outturn and better crops than it does under the present rude tillage. Of the total area one-fourth is unarable being mostly hilly; one-fourth is arable waste; and about one-half is cultivated. In 1878, a considerable area of cultivated land was thrown up owing to the death, desertion, and insolvency of cultivators, and the loss of their live stock brought about by two successive bad seasons. With few exceptions the agricultural products are rain crops, kharif, chiefly rice, d\u00e1ngar, Oryza sativa, millet, b\u00e1jri, Penicillaria spicata, maize, mak\u00e1i, Zea mays, pulse, tuver, Cajanus indicus, and banti, Panicum spicatum. In so isolated and unhealthy a country, outside husbandmen cannot be tempted to take land. The local cultivators are only Na\u00edkd\u00e1s and Kolis who formerly lived chiefly by wood-cutting. They are beginning to settle to more regular tillage and to the use of the\n\n\u00b9 In 1878, a well was built in the village of Kherva at a cost of about \u00a337 (Rs. 370) and two were improved at a cost of about \u00a318 (Rs. 180).\nplough. But the practice of sowing seeds in forest clearings, locally known as v\u00e1lra, or of working hill sides with a small pickaxe, is still general. The state has lately passed through a time of much scarcity and distress. In 1877, a very scanty rainfall caused a serious failure of crops and so great a scarcity of fodder that large numbers of cattle died. The distress was increased in the spring of 1878 by a poor mahuda, Bassia latifolia, harvest. In July and August, on the top of this double failure came excessive rains more than once washing away much of the grain. With stores almost exhausted, the people were reduced to great straits, feeding on roots and forest produce, till, in April 1879, a magnificent mahuda crop relieved the distress. The fall in the exports of timber from want of draught cattle, the large area of land thrown out of tillage, the widespread sickness, and the heavy special mortality show how severely the district suffered.\n\nIn 1856, at a cost of \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000), a rough cross-country road was cleared from J\u00e1mbughoda to Baroda. In 1861, two years after the N\u00e1ikda rising, at a cost of \u00a3357 (Shi\u00e1sh\u00e1hi Rupees 4084), lines were cleared through the forest. The chief of these was sixty miles long from J\u00e1mbughoda to Dohad. In 1872, at a cost of \u00a32446 (Rs. 24,460), of which Government contributed nearly one-half and the N\u00e1rukot and Panch Mah\u00e1ls Local Funds the rest, a road twenty-five miles long was made from J\u00e1mbughoda through H\u00e1lo in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, joining the main line from Godhra to Baroda on the south side of the Kard river. In any N\u00e1ikda outbreak or other local disturbance, this would prove a very valuable military line. The chief exports are forest produce, timber, and mahuda, of which large quantities pass from and through the state to Baroda and Dabhoi.\n\nAmong the Rewa K\u00e1ntha chiefs, who, before its transfer to British management were most notorious as robbers and bandits, were the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s of the country round Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. One of their leaders, though his territory does not appear as a separate state, was the chief of Tokalpur, the present N\u00e1rukot, a B\u00e1ria Koli by caste. In February 1826, when a Political Agent was appointed, under promise of pardon, these chiefs, \u2018after considerable hesitation and under the greatest dread and distrust,\u2019 came in and agreed to furnish security for their future good conduct, promising to cause no disturbance, to behave as quiet cultivators, to leave to Government the settlements of their claims on the revenues of neighbouring states, to keep no mercenaries, to be responsible for crime, to protect merchants, and to be subject to the authority of the Government posts.\u00b9 Soon after (1829) the office of Political Agent in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha was abolished, and the Resident at Baroda removed to Ahmedabad. The G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s manager, kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r, of Sankheda was appointed to collect the yearly tribute of \u00a34 (Rs. 41) from N\u00e1rukot. This position gave him power over the chief, and for several years the withdrawal of British supervision left him free to use his power as he chose. Unable to\n\n\u00b9 Bom, Gov, Sel. XXIII. 824.\nmanage his people, and forced by the Sankheda manager, who imprisoned both him and his family, Jagatsing (1833) agreed that, if the Baroda Government kept order and protected him from Chhota Udepur, he would make over to them one-half of his revenue. A Gaikw\u00e1r post, th\u00e1na, was established, and, in exacting one-half of the revenue, the commandant treated the people with such harshness, that, in 1837, they broke out in revolt. The services of a British force had to be engaged, and order was not restored without great difficulty. At the close of the operations, nearly the whole district was deserted, and every village burnt down. So hardly had they been treated, that the people refused to come back unless they were guaranteed freedom from the tyranny of the Gaikw\u00e1r's post. On a promise of safety from oppression and of good treatment the people began to return, and thirteen villages were soon settled.\u00b9 The chief Jagta B\u00e1ria was anxious that he should be taken under the protection of Government, and offered to pay them half of his revenues.\u00b2 The Gaikw\u00e1r remonstrated against any interference on the part of Government, but it was decided\u00b3 that as N\u00e1rukot had come under British control in 1826, the transfer to the Gaikw\u00e1r of half of the chief's estate could not be respected. The chief's offer of one-half of his revenue was at first refused. But, in 1839,\u2074 to provide funds for the management and recovery of the state, it was accepted, and special control vested in the Assistant Political Commissioner.\u2075 Since then the management of the state has remained with the British Government, the British share of the revenue being spent on the improvement of the state.\n\nOn the establishment of order in 1837, the people soon quieted down and for many years remained wonderfully free from crime.\u2076 In 1858, excited by the movements of rebel troops along the eastern border, the Naikd\u00e1s rose, plundered the post, th\u00e1na, of N\u00e1rukot, and at Jambughoda attacked a detachment under Captain Bates. Afterwards they were joined by a number of T\u00e1tia Topi's men, and, favoured by the thickness of the forest and underwood, the revolt was not put down till March 1859. Nine years later, Joria, a Naikda of Vadek, near Jambughoda began to act as a holy man, bhagat, and claimed supernatural power. Gaining much influence over the people, he was joined by Rupsing, also a Naikda, a pardoned outlaw and rebel. They together planned the establishment of a Naikda kingdom, and getting together a body of armed followers, attacked and sacked several Government posts, among them Jambughoda. Troops were quickly collected, Vadek attacked, and the bhagat's forces scattered (Feb. 16, 1868). The leaders escaped, but after a short time were taken, tried, and hanged. The people, assured that their misconduct would be forgiven, settled in their villages, and since then, in spite of the recent time of scarcity (1877-1879), order has remained unbroken and crime continued small.\u2077\n\n\u00b9 Bom.

In 1837 it was stated that, for its own good and for the peace of the province, the management of the state must for some time remain under a British officer. Since 1837 the country has been opened, settled habits introduced among the people, and the revenue greatly increased. Its extreme backwardness and the excitable character of its people still make British control necessary.\n\nExcept in the case of forest tillage, which is charged a lump sum on each clearing, the occupant pays on the number of ploughs he uses, not on the area of land he tills. The rates, at first experimental, have from time to time been changed with the double object of bringing the wild population to cultivate fixed fields, and of making them adopt a better style of tillage. For the Kolis, who are more inclined than the Naikdas to take up land, the plough rates of assessment were in 1872, for the better class of soil 4s. 6d. (Rs. 2\u00bd) for the first year, and 12s. 6d. (Rs. 6\u00bc) for the second and following years; and for the poorer soils 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd) for the first year, and 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) for the second and following years. In the case of the Naikdas, the plough rates of assessment were 1s. (8 annas) for the first year, 4s. (Rs. 2) for the second, 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) for the third, and 6s. (Rs. 3) for the fourth and following years. These rates are little more than nominal, the chief object being to induce the people to gain an honest living and to settle. In 1878 the highest plough tax was \u00a31 (Rs. 10) for a Koli and 6s. (Rs. 3) for a Naikda. Forest tillage, v\u00e1lra, paid from 1s. to 2s. (8 annas - Re. 1) a clearing. The villages of Uchat, Bhildungra, Fulpari, Nathpari, Kara, and Gundiveri are held rent-free; and, of the two villages R\u00e1mpura and Bh\u00e1npura, half the revenues are, after collection, paid to the headmen who are relations of the chief. Besides these, some of the chief's kinsmen, bh\u00e1y\u00e1ds, have a right to certain number of ploughs free of charge. Except of its boundaries no survey of the state has been made.\n\nIn so poor and simple a country as N\u00e1rukot money disputes are rare. So far there has been no call for civil courts. Such cases as arise between the chief and the cadets of his family and the resident V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, are settled by the Political Agent. From the introduction of British management up to 1868, under the Political Agent, limited magisterial powers were vested in an officer styled th\u00e1nd\u00e1r. Since the 1868 rising, a native officer of better position with the title of Mah\u00e1lkari has been appointed. He exercises second class magisterial powers, cases beyond his jurisdiction being tried by the Political Agent, who has the powers of a Judge and Sessions Judge. From the Political Agent's decisions appeals and references lie to Government. In the conduct of the court's business the spirit of the British Acts and Regulations is followed.\n\nThe ratio of crime to population amounted in 1878 to 20\u00b777 per 1000 against 11\u00b711 in 1877, and 9 in 1876. This increase, entirely in cases of petty theft, was due to the general scarcity and distress from failure of crops. Of the 139 cases decided in 1878, 135 were tried by the Mah\u00e1lkari, and four by the Political Agent. None of\nthe decisions were appealed against. The strength of the detachment supplied from the Panch Mah\u00e1ls Police, was, in 1878, owing to the unusual amount of crime, raised from forty-one to fifty-two. Of this force forty-one were armed, eight unarmed, and three mounted. They are distributed over three posts, J\u00e1mbughoda, Khand\u00edvar, and Vavchalvar.\n\nThe following table gives the number of offences reported, of persons brought to trial, and of persons convicted, during the eight years ending 1878:\n\n| Year | Offences reported | Persons brought to trial | Persons convicted | Year | Offences reported | Persons brought to trial | Persons convicted |\n|------|------------------|--------------------------|------------------|------|------------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| 1871 | 45               | 48                       | 41               | 1875 | ...              | 66                       | 74               |\n| 1872 | 26               | 22                       | 19               | 1876 | ...              | 65                       | 95               |\n| 1873 | 51               | 89                       | 54               | 1877 | ...              | 79                       | 119              |\n| 1874 | 65               | 90                       | 83               | 1878 | ...              | 142                      | 274              |\n\nA lock-up at J\u00e1mbughoda, in charge of the Mah\u00e1lkari, is used for under-trial prisoners, as well as for convicts sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen days and under. Cases of more than fifteen days imprisonment are transferred to the Panch Mah\u00e1ls subordinate and district jails. The cost of the J\u00e1mbughoda lock-up amounted in 1878 to \u00a328 (Rs. 280) against \u00a312 (Rs. 120) in 1877. In 1878 the number of prisoners was forty-nine, against forty-seven in 1877 and twenty-three in 1876.\n\nCompared with \u00a3350 (Rs. 3500) in 1849, the gross revenue for 1878-79 was \u00a3674 (Rs. 6740), or in thirty years a two-fold increase. The land revenue which had steadily risen from \u00a3439 in 1871 to \u00a3777 (Rs. 7770) in 1876, from the failure of crops in 1877 fell to \u00a3456 (Rs. 4560) and again in 1878 rose to \u00a3789 (Rs. 7890). In 1878 the forest revenue amounted to \u00a337 (Rs. 370) against \u00a363 (Rs. 630) in 1877, and \u00a3112 (Rs. 1120) in 1876. The decrease was owing to the scarcity of bullocks. For the same reason there was a fall in transit duties from \u00a3280 (Rs. 2800) to \u00a3147 (Rs. 1470).\n\nIn 1868 a school was started at J\u00e1mbughoda with the object of giving some sort of education to the wild N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s and Kol\u00eds. It is maintained out of Local Funds at a yearly cost of about \u00a335 (Rs. 350). The average daily attendance rose from 13 in 1873 to 33 in 1876; in the year of scarcity it fell to 24 and in 1878 again rose to 30\u00bd.\n\nA dispensary, opened in 1872, is under the charge of a hospital assistant. Against 230 in 1874 and 693 in 1877, 596 persons were treated in 1878. Of these, 482 were cured, 47 left, and 67 died. Vaccination, under the charge of the vaccinator employed in the neighbouring district of H\u00e1lol in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, rose from 233 in 1874 to 498 in 1876, and in 1878 fell to 161.

From the excess of rain and the failure of crops, 1878 was a most unhealthy season.\n\nJa'mbughoda, with a population of 491 souls, is the head-quarters of the state. The chief lives at Jhotvar half a mile to the north-west. Here in 1858 a detachment of the 8th Regiment N. I. under Captain Bates was attacked by the Naikdas under their leaders Rupa and Keval; and in 1868 the station was taken and sacked by a band of Joria bhagat's followers. The police station, designed with a view to defence, has room for the police guard and for the local revenue and magisterial officers.\\(^1\\) A quadrangular enclosure, it has blocks of solidly built rooms ranged round so as to give a clear central space of 196 feet by 162. At each of the four corners is a bastion, with steps leading to a roof, terraced and provided with parapets loopholed for musketry. The height of the terraces is 14 feet 4 inches, and the parapets are three feet higher. The entrance gate, ten feet broad, is provided with a wicket and protected by flanking towers. The walling is of brick and lime masonry; and the roofing of concrete arches, carried either by cross walls or on wrought-iron joists. Above the gateway is a room, twenty feet by ten, and a bath-room, twelve feet by seven, suitable for a European officer. Within the enclosure is a well. The work, begun in 1869 was finished in 1872 at a cost of \u00a34270 (Rs. 42,700). Besides this police station Ja'mbughoda has a school and dispensary.\n\n\\(^1\\) The accommodation is, for foot police 4 rooms each \\(10 \\times 10\\) feet and 26 rooms each \\(12 \\times 10\\); for mounted police 4 rooms and 4 stables each \\(10 \\times 10\\) feet; for revenue and magisterial officers there are 2 rooms each \\(15 \\times 13\\) feet, 3 each \\(13 \\times 13\\), 2 each \\(13 \\times 10\\) and one \\(43 \\times 10\\) feet.\nCAMBAY.\nCAMBAY.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nDESCRIPTION, PRODUCTS, AND POPULATION.\n\nCambay, at the head of the Cambay gulf in the west of Gujar\u00e1t, lies between 22\u00b0 9' and 22\u00b0 41' north latitude, and 72\u00b0 20' and 73\u00b0 5' east longitude. With an estimated area of about 350 square miles, it had, in 1872, a population of about 83,000 souls, and, in 1878, a revenue of nearly \u00a340,000 (Rs. 4,00,000).\n\nIt is bounded on the north by M\u00e1tar in Kaira, on the east by Borsad in Kaira and Petl\u0101d in Baroda, on the south by the gulf, and on the west by the S\u00e1barmati. The political boundaries are most irregular. In some places Cambay villages are embedded in Kaira; in other parts detached fragments of Kaira lie in the heart of Cambay. Inland, the possessions of the Naw\u00e1b stretch about fifteen miles to the west, eighteen to the north-west, ten to the north, and twelve to the east.\n\nExcept near the Mahi, where the surface is cut by water-courses, and where the river banks rise in cliffs from thirty to eighty feet high, the country is flat and open. Though in parts, especially along the S\u00e1barmati, rather bare of trees, during the rainy and cold seasons the whole is beautifully rich and green.\n\nTwo of the larger Gujar\u00e1t rivers enter the sea within Cambay limits. The S\u00e1barmati, after flowing south for about 200 miles, falls into the gulf twelve miles west of the city; and, a short way to the east, about 350 miles from its source, a five-mile broad estuary receives the waters of the Mahi. Though of great volume in times of flood, these rivers are of no use either for navigation or irrigation. The mud deposits near their mouths make them impassable for vessels of any size, and the salt of the tidal wave and the height of their banks prevent them from being used for watering the fields. Except the Mahi and S\u00e1barmati none of the Cambay streams flow throughout the year.\n\n1 The correct form of the name is Khambh\u00e1t.\n2 Saunders\u2019 Mountains and Rivers of India, 31.\nWithin Cambay limits there is no fresh-water lake of any size. Still, as in Kaira, almost every village has a pond, or reservoir, holding water for the greater part of the year. In most years, from the middle of April till the rains set in, generally late in June, the pond supplies are exhausted, and cattle have to be watered from wells.\n\nFrom its position, between two large tidal rivers, the soil of Cambay is so soaked with salt that water becomes brackish at a little distance below the surface. In many places new wells have to be sunk every five years. Besides being brackish, Cambay well water is unwholesome, often causing painful boils when incautiously used.\n\nDuring seasons of heavy rain, much of Cambay is liable to be flooded. Its rulers, in the time of prosperity (1400 - 1700), guarded against this evil by cutting drainage canals. These drains, works of great labour and cost, are now much neglected. But the people complain little, and it would seem, either that the rainfall is lighter than it was, or that the surplus water is more carefully stored in village reservoirs.\n\nA gently waving alluvial plain, Cambay has no rocks and but few pebbles. Nodular limestone, kankar, mixed with sand or clay is found in large quantities from ten to fifteen feet below the surface. Though not of the best quality, the lime it yields is much used for house-building and other local purposes.\n\nCompared with the more inland districts the climate is good and the temperature equal. Thermometer readings, kept during the three years ending 1847, show a mean minimum of $53^\\circ$ in January, and a mean maximum of $76^\\circ$ in May. During the same period, the average yearly rainfall was 29 inches 30 cents.\n\nBefore the railway made travelling easy, Cambay was the only coast station within reach of invalids suffering from the fevers and heat of inland Gujar\u00e1t. Such was its value as a sanitarium, that, in 1837, a hospital was established for the use of European officers and troops stationed in Ahmedabad, Kaira, and Baroda. On the 12th March 1837, ninety-eight invalids of the 17th Regiment of Native Infantry arrived at Cambay from Harsol, about thirty-four miles from Ahmedabad. Of the whole number, eighty-three were suffering from fever and spleen, and the rest from rheumatism and skin disease. At the end of March, fourteen more cases were admitted, making a total of 112 patients. One death occurred in April, of the rest, all except five, were discharged cured by the end of May. By the close of the rains (October), the remaining five were able to return in good health to their regiment. Another remarkable instance is the case of seventy-seven invalids of the 2nd Grenadier Regiment of Native Infantry, who were sent to Cambay from Baroda in the month of January 1847. Of the whole number, sixty-eight were suffering from fever, one from consumption, and eight from Sind ulcers. The case of consumption proved fatal. Of the rest, thirty-one were discharged cured in February, twenty-five in March, and twenty in April. About 1863, the Cambay hospital\nwas closed, and there is now no medical institution in the town. Vaccination is said to be much practised, and to meet with little opposition, but no returns are available. No bad outbreak of cholera has occurred for many years. The only disease mentioned as peculiar to Cambay is the troublesome ulcer mentioned above, called *ashraphi* by natives, and by Europeans known as the Cambay or Broach boil.\n\nWithin Cambay limits there are no forests, nor, except occasional orchards, are there any groves or plantations. Still, here and there, generally near villages, are many well grown fine trees. Among the largest and most common are the tamarind *\u00e1mi* Tamarindus indica, *nim* or *limbo* Melia azadirachta, *pipal* Ficus religiosa, banyan *vad* Ficus bengalensis, wood apple *kothi* Feronia elephantum, and mango *\u00e1mo* Mangifera indica.\n\nTowards the north and west the soil is generally black, well suited for wheat and cotton. To the east it is poorer, fit only for the inferior grains. Near Cambay, skirting the gulf, and along the banks of the Mahi and S\u00e1barmati, stretch vast tracts of salt marsh flooded at high spring tides. For tillage purposes the soils are divided into three classes, garden, rice, and dry-crop.\n\nThe crops, the same as those grown in the neighbouring parts of Kaira, are the ordinary millets and pulses, rice, wheat, tobacco,\\(^1\\) and a little indigo. The cultivation of indigo has of late greatly fallen off. Hindu peasants dislike growing it, because in making the dye much insect life is lost while the Muhammadans, with whom this objection has less force, do not till land enough to raise any large quantity. Sown towards the end of the hot season, indigo is harvested in August before coming to flower. After being cut, the crop is stowed in large vats, generally set in a corner of the field. The vats are filled with water, and the plants left to soak for one night, and, in the morning, to draw out any remaining juice, the leaves are beaten with wooden clubs. The water is then drained off, the dye remaining at the bottom of the vat. Green-looking at first, the sediment, on exposure, soon gains the true indigo hue. Mordants are sometimes used to help to precipitate the dye.\n\nThe tillage does not differ from that of neighbouring British districts. After the rains (June-October), crops are grown by water drawn in leather buckets from reservoirs, water-courses, or river-bed pools. There is very little hot weather tillage, and, except from wells, little irrigation.\n\nThe domestic animals are the same as in Kaira. In the days of the early Hindu settlements near the mouth of the Mahi, wild animals were so numerous that a city, on or near the site of Cambay, once bore the title of B\u00e1ghvati or Tiger town. As late as the end of the last century tigers and lions were found close to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Till 1879, when under agreement with the Naw\u00e1b it was stopped, opium was grown in eight villages.\nCambay. Sir Charles Malet, when Resident in 1781, killed a lion near the village of Kura on the banks of the S\u00e1barmati, about twenty miles north of Cambay. The country people called it the camel tiger, *untia v\u0101gh*, and thought it the fiercest and strongest of that race. Camel-coloured verging to yellow, he was without spots or stripes, not high but powerfully massive, with a head and foreparts of admirable size and strength. About the same time, in the S\u00e1barmati villages, so great was the dread of beasts of prey that, at the close of each day, the inhabitants gathered their cattle within the village walls. Of large beasts of prey no trace remains. The only game is *nilg\u00e1i*, *Portax pictus*, wild hog, and large herds of antelope, *Antelope bezoartica*, that feed on the short herbage of salt marsh lands. During the cold weather every pond is alive with duck, teal, and snipe.\n\nThe 1872 census gives a total population of 83,494 souls, or 238 persons to the square mile, a density of population greater than in any Gujar\u00e1t state except Baroda. Of the total population, 71,505, or 85\u00b764 per cent, were Hindus; 11,882, or 14\u00b723 per cent, Musalm\u00e1ns; and 107 P\u00e1rs\u00eds. There were no Christians. Males numbered 44,283, or 53 per cent of the population, and females 39,211, or 47 per cent, or an average proportion of 113 to 100. Insane and infirm persons numbered 112, or 0\u00b713 per cent of the population. Of these two were insane, 15 idiots, 25 deaf and dumb, 67 blind, and 3 lepers. There are no details of the strength of the different Hindu tribes and castes. Compared with other Gujar\u00e1t states, the proportion of aboriginal tribes is very small. Arranged according to religion, of the 71,505 Hindus 32,504 were Vaishnavs, including 16,457 R\u00e1m\u00e1nujas, 8209 Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1ry\u00e1s, 1480 Kabir-panthis, 712 M\u00e1dhv\u00e1ch\u00e1ry\u00e1s, and 5646 Sv\u00e1min\u00e1r\u00e1yans; 20,147 were Shaivs; 3868 Shr\u00e1vaks; 525 ascetics; and 14,461 belonged to no special sect. Of the 11,882 Musalm\u00e1ns 10,765 were Sunnis, and 1117 Shi\u00e1s. Arranged according to occupation, there were, employed under Government or municipal or other local authorities, 2227 souls, or 2\u00b766 per cent; professional persons, 1274, or 1\u00b752 per cent; in service, 1604, or 1\u00b792 per cent; in agriculture, 13,670, or 16\u00b737 per cent; in trade, 1138, or 1\u00b736 per cent; in arts and crafts, 9855, or 11\u00b780 per cent; beggars and paupers, 547; and not otherwise classed, (a) wives 26,316 and children 26,687, in all 53,003, or 63\u00b748 per cent, and (b) miscellaneous persons 723 or 0\u00b786 per cent; total 53,726 or 64\u00b734 per cent.\n\nBesides as husbandmen, Kanbis work as carnelian polishers, a craft once carried on chiefly by Musalm\u00e1ns. Many Br\u00e1hmans, V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, and other high class Hindus, have, owing to the decline of\n\n---\n\n1 Forbes' Oriental Memoirs, III. 90, 94. Nicolo Conti (1420-1444) says, in Cambay wild cattle are found in great abundance, with a mane like the mane of a horse, and horns so long that when the head is turned back, they touch the tail. These horns, he adds, are used like barrels for carrying water. Major's India in the XVth Century, II. 20.\n\n2 This is doubtful. The returns shew 16,134 Ling\u00e1yats a sect not known in Gujar\u00e1t. They were possibly *ling* worshippers.\ntrade, moved to Bombay, and so small is the local demand for their labour, that numbers of goldsmiths, blacksmiths, barbers, seamen, and fishermen seek employment in Surat, Broach, Ahmedabad and other districts of Gujar\u00e1t, and in Bombay. Remaining away about seven or eight months in the year, they return with their earnings during the rains. Very few of the Kh\u00e1rv\u00e1s are sailors. Besides manufacturing salt, they have, in many Gujar\u00e1t towns, and, to some extent in Bombay, monopolized the work of turning roof-tiles. Many educated Br\u00e1hman and V\u00e1nia youths find work in Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay, and other places, as accountants and clerks, seldom visiting their native country except for marriages or other great family events. Among Cambay Musalm\u00e1ns there is an unusually large number of Shias (1117). The Naw\u00e1b, a Persian by descent, is a Shia, and the Persian and Shia element was, in the eighteenth century, strengthened by three sets of refugees. Some came in 1723, after (October 1722) Persia was conquered by the Ghiljeis; others, in 1789, when N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h seized the throne and abolished Shi\u00e1ism as the state religion;\u00b9 and a third section are the descendants of soldiers who left N\u00e1dir\u2019s army on his return to Persia (1739). Most of their descendants are either connected with the court or in the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s service, and foreigners still come as recruits for the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s Persian regiment. Besides Persians, there is a body of Shia traders of the D\u00e1\u00fadi sect, followers of the Mulla Saheb of Surat. Of the Sunnis some are cultivators, but most are either in trade or are carpet-weavers, shoemakers, book-binders, potters, or private servants. Sadi\u00e1s, Musalm\u00e1n carriers, have carts and bullocks, which they use in carrying goods from the landing place to the town. As a body, the Musalm\u00e1ns are badly off, with little energy and less enterprize. The Bohor\u00e1s are an exception. Well-to-do and enterprising, they trade to China, Japan, and Zanzib\u00e1r, settling there for as long as ten years at a time. P\u00e1rsis, once powerful, now number only 107 souls. They are traders, distillers, and weavers.\n\nBefore the time of the present Naw\u00e1b (1841), all state offices were given to Musalm\u00e1ns. This rule has of late been broken, and, except that a few posts in the army and household are kept for members of the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s family, Hind\u00fas and P\u00e1rsis are allowed to hold almost any office. The style of living does not differ from that of the neighbouring Gujar\u00e1t districts. Gujar\u00e1ti is the ordinary Hindu language. Musalm\u00e1ns use Hindustani, and many of them, the descendants of the eighteenth century refugees, still speak fairly pure Persian.\n\nAccording to the 1872 census, the eighty-seven Cambay villages included 29,505 houses, or an average of 84 houses to the square mile. Of these 7741, or about 26 per cent, were built of stone or fire-baked brick; the rest had walls of mud, or unburnt brick, with roofs of thatch or palm leaves. Dwellings of the better sort lodged 21,049 persons, or 25 per cent of the whole population, at the rate of 2\u00b772 souls to each house, and houses of the inferior sort lodged 62,445 persons, or 75 per cent of the whole, or 2\u00b787 souls to each house.\n\n\u00b9 Forbes\u2019 Oriental Memoirs, III, 83.\nOf the 87 villages, 27 have less than 200 souls, 22 from 200 to 500, 25 from 500 to 1000, 9 from 1000 to 2000, 2 from 3000 to 5000, one between 5000 and 10,000, and one above 10,000. They belong to two main classes, coast and inland villages. The thirty coast villages include the arable lands along the shore of the gulf and the banks of the S\u00e1barmati. From their wheat-growing soil, these are known as the b\u00e1ra villages, and yield a yearly revenue estimated at about \u00a320,000.\\(^1\\) Though the soil of many of them is poor, some of the fifty-seven inland villages, in the rich tract of reddish loam known as the charotar, yield heavy crops of tobacco, millet, cotton, opium, and indigo.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cambay Rs. 2,64,949; Imperial Rs. 2,11,959\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). The Cambay coin is \\(15\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent less in value than the Imperial rupee.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTRADE AND MANUFACTURES.\n\nBefore the time of railways, goods and passengers were carried by boat to Bombay and other ports. Now the passenger traffic is almost entirely by rail through Anand, about thirty miles east of Cambay. Though Cambay is without made roads, the country is level enough for carts. The Cambay harbour is ill suited for trade and yearly becomes more blocked with silt. The silt, brought down by the rivers in the rainy season, or thrown up by the tide, is constantly changing the bed of the gulf. Passages deep enough for coasting craft of from twenty-five to thirty tons are sometimes, in the course of a single rainy season, closed, and fresh channels cut through high banks of mud. At present (1879) boats moor a mile from the city gate, and, except during spring tides, have to be unloaded about half a mile from the landing place. During the last three years, the largest vessel that visited Cambay was one of fifty-seven tons from Kalikat.\n\nAcross the mouth of the Mahi, from Cambay to K\u00e1vi in Broach, a ferry-boat plies at all seasons. Especially at the springs, when the tide rushes with extreme violence, the passage is difficult.\n\nIn the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, one of the chief centres of commerce in western India, Cambay has a trade history of much interest. The first references are early in the tenth century. It then produced mangoes, cocoanuts, lemons, rice in great abundance, and great quantities of honey. Leather was largely manufactured,\n\n---\n\n1 The many interesting Portuguese Trade and History references have been obtained through the kindness of Dr. Gerson da Cunha of Bombay.\n\n2 Of the passage of the mouth of the Mahi, Ogilby (1670, Atlas, V. 215) gives the following details: About a league southward from Cambay glides the river Mihi, whose shore must be travelled at the low ebb of the sea, and not without great danger because the sea rising flows up above five leagues, and at low tide you are forced to wade through two or three deep places. If any one should venture to wade through at the coming in of the tide, he would undoubtedly be swallowed by the sea, for when the water flows with greater strength and higher than ordinary (for it observes no rule, but rises or falls more or less according to the course of the moon), it carries and washes away both horse and man, and oftentimes with such force, that an elephant cannot withstand the same, nor all his weight prevent him from being carried away; therefore all travellers wait for a certain time to wade through the same, viz., when the sea is low, which is at the new moon, at which time they may go over it in coaches or horseback without any danger. Coaches are commonly held fast on both sides that they may not be overturned by the waves. Those that go on foot strip themselves naked, and, tying up their clothes, carry them on their shoulders. Many times a whole caravan with abundance of people travel over the same, some on horseback and others on foot, both men and women stark naked, accounting it neither shameful nor immodest.\nand Cambay was famous for the sandals which bore its name. Many of its merchants were Arab and Persian Musalmans who had mosques of their own, and were kindly treated by the Hindu governor. The trade was harassed by pirates known as Baw\u00e1rij, from their boats, baria. Scouring the Arabian Sea as far as Sokotra, they chased the Arab ships bound for India and China, 'as the Greek galleys chased the Musalmans in the Mediterranean'.\n\nDuring the eleventh century, though the Baw\u00e1rij from Cutch and Somn\u00e1th still harassed its ships, Cambay maintained its position as one of the chief centres of Gujar\u00e1t trade. Its markets were supplied with the ginger and cotton of the surrounding country, with the produce of north India brought overland from Mult\u00e1n either direct or by the sea-coast, with Cutch balm, and M\u00e1lwa sugar. By sea Cambay traded west with Persia, Arabia, and Sof\u00e1la in Africa, and east with Malab\u00e1r, Coromandel, and, in great ships called junks, with China.\n\nIn the twelfth century, wheat, rice, indigo, and Indian cane were the chief exports, though merchandise of every country was to be found and was sent from Cambay to all parts. Pirates still infested the Gujar\u00e1t seas; but at Cambay itself traders had gained some security, as a fine fortress had been built by the 'Government of India'.\n\nAt the close of the thirteenth century Cambay was one of the two chief ports of India. Its exports were indigo in great abundance, cotton exported to many quarters, much fine cotton cloth or buckram, and a great trade in hides. The chief imports were gold, silver, copper, tutia (the inferior oxide of zinc used as an eye-salve), madder from the Red Sea, and horses from the Persian Gulf.\n\n---\n\n1 M\u00e1usudi (913), Prairies d'Or, I. 253, 254; Reinand's Memoir Sur l'Inde, 221; and Ibn Haukal (943) in Elliot, I. 38.\n2 Ibn Haukal (943) in Elliot, I. 34.\n3 M\u00e1usudi (913) Prairies d'Or, III. 37; Yule's Marco Polo, II. 344. Besides Rajputs of the Saog\u00e1r tribe these pirates included Jats, Meyds, and Knrks. According to Wilford (As. Res. IX. 224), under the name Diweni, or men of Diu, their interference with trade so enraged the Romans, that they were forced to send hostages to Constantinople. The early Arab writers (800-1000) mention the Jats (834-885) making a descent on the Tigris with so powerful a fleet that the whole strength of the Kaliphat had to be sent against them; (Ibn Alatyrr, 834, in Reinand's Fragments 201); the Kurks carrying their raids as far as Jadda in the Red Sea (Elliot's History, I. 509, and II. 246-248); and the Meyds of Saur\u00e1shtra warring with the men of Basra.

Every year a number of ships went to Arabia laden with the skins of goats, of oxen, of buffaloes, of wild oxen, of unicorns, and other animals. The leather was used for sandals, and was cleverly worked into red and blue sleeping mats, exquisitely inlaid with figures of birds and beasts, and skilfully embroidered with gold and silver wire. Yule's Marco Polo, II. 328-329.\n9 Yule's Marco Polo, II. 333.\nAmong its merchants were many foreign Musalmans and a large community of Parsis, whose interests were carefully watched by the Solanki kings of Anhilvada. Many of the seamen were Hindus, Rajputs and Kolis by caste, to whom an entire quarter of Anhilvada was devoted. Though Cambay is said to have been free from pirates, the Arabian Sea was still overrun by Cutch and Somnath corsairs 'the most atrocious robbers in existence'.\n\nExcept Ibn Batuta's (1345) statement that the city was prosperous, and the knowledge that, at the beginning of this century, the old trade route between Asia and Europe by way of the Red Sea was reopened, nothing regarding the trade of Cambay in the fourteenth century has been traced.\n\nThe chief articles of Cambay trade mentioned by travellers of the fifteenth century are sardonyx, spikenard, lac, indigo, myrobalans, silks, and paper. During this period, the Musalman rulers of Gujar\u00e1t paid much attention to naval matters, and on five occasions Cambay shared in the work of equipping fleets. One of these expeditions, in 1430, was political, directed against Ahmad Shah Bahmani (1422-1435); the ruler of Thana and the central Konkan. The object of the remaining four was the suppression of piracy.\n\nShortly after the beginning of the sixteenth century, the control of the sea trade of Cambay passed from the king of Gujar\u00e1t to the Portuguese. Perhaps because much more information is available, the sixteenth century is generally considered the time of Cambay's chief prosperity. But it seems doubtful if the trade of Cambay was ever again so great as it was during the reign of Mahmud Begada (1459-1513). In spite of the successes of the early years (1526-1530) of Bahadur's reign, the sixteenth century was, on the whole, a time of decline in Gujar\u00e1t; and though the Portuguese may have increased the demand for Cambay products, and, to some extent, have improved navigation, they, for several years (1529-1534), spared no effort to injure the harbours and shipping of Gujar\u00e1t. Even when (1533) they became the acknowledged rulers of the Cambay seas, it was their interest to reduce\n\n---\n\n1 See the story of Sidhr\u00e1j (1094-1143) in Elliot's History, II. 164.\n2 Ras Mal\u00e1, I. 318.

Among these articles, paper is noticed by Nicolo Conti (1420-1444) as being used in Cambay and nowhere else in India. Indigo is mentioned by Nicolo, by Athanasius Nikotin (1468-1474), and by Hieronimo (1499).\n5 These expeditions against pirates, all of them undertaken by Mahmud Begada (1459-1513), were, 1475, against the Malabars; 1480, against Jigat and Bet; 1482, against Balsar; 1494, against a revolted officer of the Deccan Government who had captured some Gujar\u00e1t trading ships. Active measures would seem to have been much required, as, according to Athanasius Nikotin (1468-1474), the sea was infested with pirates, all of them K\u00e1fars (Hindus), neither Christians nor Musalmans, who 'prayed to stone idols, and knew not Christ.' Major, III. 11.\n6 During Mahmud's reign, according to Varthema (1508), Cambay and another city (apparently in Bengal) supplied all Africa, Arabia, Ethiopia, and India, including Persia, Tartary, Turkey, and Syria, and a multitude of inhabited islands with silk and cotton stuffs. Badger's Varthema, III.\nCambay to a local port, and draw the foreign trade to their own cities Diu, Chaul, and Goa. With the decline of Portuguese power, the trade between Cambay and the Red Sea revived, and before the English (1608) came to Gujar\u00e1t, it was again of considerable consequence.\\(^1\\)\n\nOf the marts connected with Cambay at the beginning of the sixteenth century, there were, of inland towns, in Gujar\u00e1t, Ahmedabad, P\u00e1tan, and Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner; and in Upper India, Delhi and L\u00e1h\u00f3r. Of sea-ports, there were Gogha and Diu in Gujar\u00e1t, Diul in Sind, and Kalikat and Cochin on the Malab\u00e1r coast: to the west were, Ormuz in the Persian Gulf; Sheher, Aden, and Jadda on the Arabian coast, and Magadoxa, Melinda, and Mombaza in east Africa:\\(^2\\) and to the east were Ceylon, Chittagong, Martaban, Tenasserim, and Malacca. Early in the century, under Portuguese influence Diu, Chaul, and Goa became the chief Indian places of trade with Cambay; Ormuz remained the head-quarters of the trade to Persia;\\(^3\\) the traffic with the Red Sea was for a time nearly destroyed; and, when it again revived, Mokha not Aden, was the chief station. The dealings with east Africa, falling almost entirely into Portuguese hands, were managed from Chaul in the Konkan. In the east, Satgong to some extent took the place of Chittagong, but Malacca, after 1511 in the power of the Portuguese, remained the centre of that great trade.\n\nIn the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Cambay exports were:\n\n- **Of minerals**, the agates, carnelians, and crystals, known as Cambay stones;\n- **Of vegetable products**, rice sent to Sind, the Konkan, Malab\u00e1r, Arabia, and Africa; millet to Malab\u00e1r and Africa; wheat\\(^4\\) to Malab\u00e1r, Arabia, and Africa; pulse and sesame to Malab\u00e1r; cotton to Malab\u00e1r and Arabia; ginger and pepper\\(^5\\) to Persia; and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Three Voyages of Vasco de Gama, LVI.; and Capt.

The decline of Portuguese trade dates from 1580, when Portugal was absorbed in the Spanish empire. Besides the opposing interests of Chaul and Goa, Gujar\u00e1t at this time had a powerful rival in Tatta in Sind, from which spices were sent up the Indus and distributed through L\u00e1h\u00f3r, and by the same route the goods of Upper India were brought to the sea.

These settlers made large profits, exchanging Cambay coloured stuffs and beads with the people from the interior for unweighed gold, so much in quantity that they generally gained 100 per cent. Here, too, they collected large quantities of ivory. Barbosa (1501-1517): Stanley's Translation, 7.\n\n\\(^3\\) The whole revenue of Ormuz depends (1523) on Cambay trade. Mon. Ined.

The author of the Mir\u00e2t-i-Ahm\u00e2di (Bird, 102) says, though in his time (1750) much wheat was produced in Gujar\u00e1t, formerly the better kinds had to be imported.

Varthema (Badger\u2019s Edition, 107) (1508) says \u2018every year 40 or 50 vessels are laden with cotton and silk stuffs\u2019; Barbosa (65) speaks of \u2018many cloths of white cotton, fine and coarse\u2019; and Frederic (1585) of \u2018an infinite quantity of cloth made of bombast of all sorts, white, stamped, and painted.\u2019 (Hakluyt\u2019s Voyages, II. 343). The Portuguese brought Malab\u00e1r pepper and Malacca spices to exchange for Cambay cloth (Mon. Ind. (1523-1554) V. I. 13, and V. II. 79). They (1538) called Cambay \u2018the garment of the world,\u2019 for it yielded cloth enough to cover the whole east and a large part of the people of the west. Don Jo\u00e3o de Castro, Prim.

Compare Frederic (Hakluyt\u2019s Voyages, II. 344). \u2018An infinite number of artificers that make bracelets of elephant\u2019s teeth.\u2019 One of the chief changes in Cambay trade during the sixteenth century was the decay in the leather manufacture. Barbosa, though he notices (52) the embroidered shoes of very good leather worn by the Hindus of Gujar\u00e1t, the stout leather leggings of the Muhammadan soldiery (56), and the stamped kid skins with which the Cambay carriages were lined (65), nowhere speaks of leather as one of the manufactures of Gujar\u00e1t. In Frederic\u2019s list sandals appear among the imports, while Mandelcelo (1638) expressly mentions the shoes as being of red Spanish leather (Harris, II. 122), and somewhat later (1651) Tavernier notices shoes made of Maroquin or Turkey leather, (Harris, II. 357).\n\u00b9\u2070 SIND SPICES. The chief Sind spice was costus, kuth or putchock, also called Radix dulcis or Lignum dulce. This went to China where it was much burned as incense. The Portuguese ship that goes (1585) every year from Malacca to China, is called the ship of drugs, because she carries divers drugs of Cambay.\u2019 (Frederic in Hakluyt\u2019s Voyages, II. 356). Gugal or Balsamodendron, probably bdelium, was also found in Sind, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and Cutch.

There was a large trade in precious stones. Rubies came from Pegu and Ceylon, topazes and cat\u2019s-eyes from Ceylon, and turquoises, emeralds, and lapis-lazuli from Persia. Of grains, fruits, and vegetable dyes, rice, cardamoms, betel-leaves, areca nuts, and cocoanuts came from Malab\u00e1r; opium, betel-leaf, madder, ginger, and galls from Arabia; and raisins, dates, the root ruinas for dyeing, and musk and rhubarb from Persia. Of perfumes and spices; cloves came from the Moluccas, nutmeg and mace from Pegu and Banda, white sandalwood from Timor, camphor from Borneo and Sum\u00e1tra, benjamin or benzoin from Si\u00e1m, Malacca, and Sum\u00e1tra, cassia from Malab\u00e1r, cinnamon from Ceylon and J\u00e1va, eaglewood or lign-aloes from Cochin-China, pepper from Malab\u00e1r, Ceylon, Bengal, Sum\u00e1tra, and J\u00e1va, and ginger from Quilon. Of animals, horses were brought from Persia and Arabia, and elephants from Ceylon and Malab\u00e1r. Of animal products, coral came from the Red Sea, pearls from the Persian Gulf and Ceylon, ivory from Africa, tortoiseshell and cowries from the Maldives, pigeon\u2019s dung used as a dye from Africa, lac from Pegu and Martaban, musk from Ava, and ambergris from Africa, Sokotra, and the Maldive Islands. Of manufactured articles, velvets, brocades, and woollen cloth came from the Red Sea, fine muslins from Bengal and the Konkan, and porcelain from Martaban and China.\n\nThese details describe Cambay trade in the early part of the sixteenth century. Of the state of things towards its close (1585), C\u00e6sar Frederic has left the following summary: Barks came in laden with all sorts of spices, with silk of China, with sandals, with elephant\u2019s teeth, velvets of Vercini, great quantity of pannina from Mecca, with gold pieces and money, and divers sorts of other merchandise. Barks went out laden with an infinite quantity of cloth made of\n\n---\n\n1 Most of these articles reached Aden from Europe by Suez and Jadda. It was this trade that was most affected by the new Cape of Good Hope route. Throughout the greater part of the sixteenth century, the chief import of these articles into Cambay was by Goa and Chaul. But, as noticed above, towards its close, the trade between Gujar\u00e1t and the Red Sea had considerably revived.\n\n2 Betel-leaf is doubtful. Frederic (Hakluyt\u2019s Voyages, II, 343) says: \u2018Great quantity of pannina which cometh from Mecca.\u2019 This may be pan which in Ibn Batut\u00e1\u2019s time (1342) was reared in Arabia and much esteemed by the people of India. (Lee\u2019s Ibn Batuta, 59). After its cession to the Portuguese (1534) great quantities of betel leaf went from Bassein to Cambay. Mon. Ined. II, 158.\n\n3 Galls were (1514) brought from the Levant through Mecca to Cambay, and from Cambay distributed to China and J\u00e1va where they were worth a great deal.\u201d Barbosa, 191.\n\n4 This musk and rhubarb came by land from Tartary. Other supplies were brought by sea from China.\n\n5 In the sixteenth century European velvet, scarlet cloth, and cloth of gold, chiefly of Venetian make, would seem to have been more prized than cloths of the same kind made in the east. Thus the Gujar\u00e1t weavers are praised (Gladwin\u2019s Ain-i-Akbari, II, 63) for imitating the silk manufactures of Turkey and Europe, and the velvets imported from the Red Sea were esteemed over the whole of the east. (Barbosa, 186 and 188). Terry (1616-1618) says expressly, the Indian velvets, satins, and taffetas are not so rich as those of Italy. Kerr, IX, 392.\nbombast of all sorts, white, stamped, and painted, with great quantity of indigo, with ginger and myrobalans dried and conserved, with borax in paste, great store of sugar, great quantity of cotton, abundance of opium, assafoetida, puchio, and many other drugs, Diu turbans, and great carnelians, granates, agates, and bloodstones.\n\nThe merchants were of two classes, residents and strangers. Of the residents some were Musalm\u00e1ns and some were Hindus. Of the Hindu trading houses some had branches, or correspondents, in many ports both Indian and foreign. Among Indian ports, mention is made of colonies of Cambay merchants in D\u00e1bhol, Cochin, and still more in Kalikat where they were much honoured, lived in good houses in separate streets, and followed their own customs. At this time Gujar\u00e1t Hindus do not seem to have settled east of Cochin. West they were found at Ormuz, and, in great numbers, at Melinda and Mombaza in east Africa. Many resident Musalm\u00e1n traders were foreigners, descendants of the Arab and Persian merchants mentioned by the early Arab travellers. Of the stranger merchants, the greater number were, in the early part of the century, Musalm\u00e1ns from Western Asia, and later on, Portuguese and other Europeans.\n\n1 C\u00e9sar Frederic (1563-1585): Hakluyt's Voyages, II. 343.\n2 D\u00e1bhol (north latitude 17\u00b0 34' east longitude 73\u00b0 16') in Ratn\u00e1giri was, in the 14th and 15th centuries, a great Musalm\u00e1n place of trade.\n3 Barbosa, 146. Early European travellers differed much in their estimate of Hindu merchants. Marco Polo, (1290) and Jordanus, (1323) describe the Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed Hindu traders of Kalikat as the best merchants in the world, and the most truthful. (Yule's Marco Polo, II. 299, and Yule's Jordanus, 22). This agrees with Frederic's description of the perfect trust stranger merchants placed in the Hindu brokers of Cambay (Hakluyt's Voyages, II. 343), and with Laval (Voyages, II. 214-220) who says, though fine and subtle, they are (1610) neither cheats nor easily cheated. On the other hand, Barbosa (1514) found the Hindus of Gujar\u00e1t, 'great usurers and falsifiers of weights and measures, and merchandise and coin, and liars and cheats' (52); and Peyton (Kerr, IX. 230) (1615) calls the Surat brokers 'subtle, and, unless well looked after, ready to deceive both the buyer and the seller'; and De Coutto (1600, Dec. IV, Lib. I. Chap. VII.) thought that, from the religious care they took to cheat Christians, the Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1n\u00edas must be descended from the lost tribes of Israel.\n4 Ormuz. Abd-er-Razzak (1442) mentions idolaters in great numbers (Major's XVth Century, I. 7), and Newberry (1583) found Gentiles there. (Hakluyt's Voyages, II. 379). Vasco de Gama (1498) found many Gentile merchants from Cambay in Melinda and Mombaza (Kerr's Voyages, II. 337, and Correa's Three Voyages of De Gama, 137, note 1. Compare Barbosa, 13).\n5 See above p. 184.\n6 Hieronimo (about 1490) found at Cambay some Moorish merchants of Alexandria and Damascus (Major, IV. 9). So many Turks, says Varthema (1508), resided constantly at Diu that it was known as Din-bandar-rumi or the Turk's Diu, as distinguished from Diu or Diul Sind, whose westward trade was almost entirely with the Persian Gulf. Badger's Varthema, 92.\n7 Frederic (about 1585) gives an account of the relations between the European merchants and the class of Hindu traders, who, under the name of brokers, have played so important a part in the establishment of European trade settlements in India. On arriving at Cambay the merchant chooses his agent from among the brokers, Gentiles and men of authority, every one of them with from fifteen to twenty servants. Leaving a list of his goods in the broker's hands, and taking on land the furniture he brought with him in the ship, for household provision all merchants coming to India must bring with them, the merchant drives to an empty house in the city where bedsteads, tables, chairs, and empty jars of water have been made ready by the broker against the arrival of some stranger. While the merchant rests, the broker is clearing the goods and bringing them to the house, the merchant not knowing anything thereof, neither custom nor charge. Then the broker tells the merchant the ruling rates both of the goods he has to sell and those he may wish to buy, asking whether he will sell at once or wait.\nRegarding the land trade that centred in Cambay, little has been traced. The chief routes were through Ahmedabad, north to Agra, Delhi, and L\u00e1hor, and west, through R\u00e1dhanpur, to Tatta in Sind.\u00b9 Within Gujar\u00e1t limits almost all merchandise was carried in bullock carts,\u00b2 and west from Gujar\u00e1t on camels. The country was unsettled, and the merchants were liable to be robbed by bands of Rajputs and Kolis. Generally the traders went in caravans, trusting for safety to the escort of a Bh\u00e1t.\u00b3\n\nDuring the whole of this period Cambay harbour was unserviceable for large trading vessels. At the beginning of the century, Barbosa notices the difficulty and danger of the navigation at the head of the gulf, and advises no one, without the help of a native pilot, to venture as far as Gandh\u00e1r, between Cambay and Broach. At that time (1514), though the larger vessels occasionally passed to the head of the gulf,\u2074 as a rule, ships trading to distant ports loaded and unloaded in Diu, Gogha, and Gandh\u00e1r, the goods finding their way to and from Cambay in small boats.\u2075 Later on, the harbour was even more unserviceable. No craft but small vessels or barks went to Cambay, and these only twice in the month at the time of new and of full moon.\u2076 Early in the century (1507), a fleet, equipped from Cambay, acted with Egyptian vessels against the Portuguese. Though many ships were lost at Diu in 1509, a Gujar\u00e1t fleet was kept up, till, in 1529, it was destroyed by the Portuguese in Bombay harbour. A few years later (1534) the Gujar\u00e1t king agreed, in acknowledgment of the Portuguese supremacy at sea, that no Gujar\u00e1t ships should trade without a Portuguese pass.\u2077 In return for this concession, the Portuguese occasionally sent their fleets to act against pirates in Cambay waters.\u2078 These expeditions had no lasting effect. Towards the close of the century (1585) so many pirates went robbing and spoiling along the coast, that, except with very well appointed and well armed ships, or 'with the fleet of the Portugals', there was no safe sailing.\u2079\n\nThe merchant makes his choice. After he has chosen, the whole work of bartering, or of selling and buying, rests with the broker, for 'tarry as long as he will the merchant's goods cannot be sold by any man, but by the broker that had taken them on land and paid the custom.'

If their charge is molested, the Bh\u00e1ts kill themselves, and the Rajputs are judged guilty of death by their R\u00e1j\u00e1s. When camels were hired at R\u00e1dhanpur the Bh\u00e1ts were dismissed (Sidhi Ali in Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. II. 9, 10). Barbosa seems to refer to the Bh\u00e1ts (translated pater p. 54) calling them Br\u00e1hmans of a lower rank, who, even if there should be war or thieves, always pass safely.\n\u2074 Compare Varthema (1508), who says you cannot go to Cambay either with large or middle sized ships except at high water, 105.\n\u2075 These boats were of a peculiar build, and were called takveri, Ain-i-Akbari, II. 64.\n\u2076 Frederic in Hakluyt's Voyages, II. 343.\n\u2077 Far\u00eda Suza in Kerr, VI. 114, 117, 209, 227.\n\u2078 Attacks are mentioned on Seal Bet in 1630, and in 1568 against pirates who were infesting the Portuguese trade.

But, though during the greater part of the seventeenth century its cotton and silk manufactures maintained their position among the most valued exports of Western India, the general trade became more and more limited.\\(^2\\) The more important articles were, of exports, silk and cotton stuffs of all kinds, and of imports, money, dates, and other merchandise.\\(^3\\) Besides the home trade to Diu and Goa, Cambay goods went west to the Persian Gulf and to Mocha, and east to Achin in Sumatra.\n\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century, Cambay, though subordinate to Surat, was in products and manufactures inferior to few Indian towns. The staples of its trade were carnelians and agates, grain, cotton, silk, and embroidery, the best in India, perhaps in the world.\\(^4\\) Half a century later, among the Cambay exports, were, salt like coarse sand with a special virtue for the weak, carnelian, and ivory articles, and cloths like those of Persia, Arabia, Abyssinia, Constantinople, and Europe.\\(^5\\) Towards the close of the century, great quantities of coarse coloured cotton cloth were still manufactured in the city and exported for the African markets. But the weavers were few and poor, and, except the English broker, there was no merchant of eminence.\\(^6\\) In 1787 the only exports were carnelians, salt, and tobacco. Indigo was grown but none was exported as the makers mixed it so that no one would buy it.\\(^7\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Of Cambay (1601-1611), before the bulk of the trade passed to Surat, Pyrard de Laval writes: Next to Goa no Indian city has so rich a trade as Cambay. Three or four times a year great fleets, from 200 to 300 sail, called the kaffla of Cambay, come to Goa. Its arrival causes great rejoicing like the arrival of the Indian fleet in Portugal. The chief articles that came from Cambay were, indigo, beautifully worked precious stones, crop crystal, iron, copper, alum, wheat 'the best in the world', rice, many drugs, butter, oil for eating, perfuming and anointing the body, black and white soap, sugar, pepper, wax, honey, much opium, cloth covering men and women from head to feet from the Cape of Good Hope to China, worked cloth, painted cloth, silk, beautifully worked coverlets and canopies, painted and lacquered bedsteads and other household goods, bed tapes, cotton hunting hammocks, carpets like Persian but not so fine or dear, inlaid work of mother-of-pearl, ivory, gold, silver, and precious stones all of great skill, tortoiseshell boxes, and no end of gold, silver, iron and wood work. Voyages (Goa, 1862), II. 214-220.\n\n\\(^2\\) The chief local cause of the transfer of trade from Cambay to Surat was the silting of the head of the gulf. In the beginning of the sixteenth century (1508) large ships would seem to have been able to pass to Cambay. (Varthema, 105). Later on this became possible only to small vessels, and towards the close of the century (1585) to small vessels only at spring tides. (Frederic in Hakluyt's Voyages, II. 344). In the beginning of the seventeenth century (1608) there was a topping trade for all sorts of cloth and rich drugs. (Finch in Harris, I. 89). Fifty years later ships of burden had to lie a good distance from the shore. Small vessels might, at high water, anchor close by the city, but at low water they lay dry. (Ogilby's Atlas, V. 212). About the same time, Tavernier (1642-1666) says the trade is almost lost because the sea, that once came so close to the town that little vessels could anchor by it, is now half a league distant from it, and near the coast is so shallow that great ships can come no nearer than three or four leagues.

The following statement shows the exports and imports for 1840, 1875, and 1878:\n\n### Cambay Trade, 1840, 1875, and 1878.\n\n| Articles | 1839-40 | 1874-75 | 1877-78 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n|          | Imports | Exports | Imports | Exports | Imports | Exports |\n| Quantity | Value   | Quantity | Value   | Quantity | Value   | Quantity | Value   |\n| Clarified butter | Cwt. | \u00a32 | Cwt. | \u00a32 | Cwt. | \u00a32 | Cwt. | \u00a32 |\n| Coconuts | 129 | 363 | 3809 | 24 | 2020 | 11,882 | 130 | 570 |\n| Carnelian | 1795 | 389 | 818 | 8437 | 2382 | 1440 | 519 |\n| Cotton | 32 | 58 | 11 | 529 | 2310 |\n| Cotton seed | 367 | 124 | 468 | 162 |\n| Cotton tape, twist, thread, and yarn | 181 | 3997 | 50 | 238 | 1283 | 6 | 15 | 77 |\n| Dried fruit | 3123 | 1570 | 8837 | 1605 |\n| Dyes, morinda, sorangi; safflower, kusumbo; and indigo | 195 | 443 | 1190 | 501 | 470 | 495 | 71 | 74 | 287 | 400 |\n| Grain | 3277 | 448 | 1830 | 658 | 1682 | 543 | 708 | 761 |\n| Grass | 878 | 422 | 312 | 517 | 553 | 1682 |\n| Ivory and tortoise shell, kachakda | 30 | 408 | 23 | 40 |\n| Mahuda flower | 1743 | 488 | 350 |\n| Matches | 1793 | 1060 | 1629 | 130 |\n| Metal | 6331 | 8221 | 31,821 | 14,021 |\n| Molasses | 147 | 212 | 150 | 285 |\n| Oil | 1482 | 1148 | 1224 | 248 | 1379 | 1278 |\n| Piece goods | 1555 | 15,827 | 712 | 13,227 | 15,123 | 101 |\n| Salt | 172 | 237 | 75 | 855 | 230 |\n| Silk | 10 | 254 | 6 | 74 | 4888 |\n| Soap | 2835 | 196 |\n| Stone | 104 | 412 | 158 | 196 |\n| Sugar | 1081 | 2070 | 2874 | 3542 |\n| Sundries | 4559 | 918 | 2297 | 733 | 15,005 | 10,681 |\n| Timber | 3223 | 4594 |\n| Tobacco | 43,195 | 11,105 | 54,663 | 64,085 |\n| Wooden bracelets | 24 | 287 |\n\nThe figures show an increase in the imports from \u00a334,903 in 1839-40 to \u00a337,832 in 1874-75 or 8\u00b739 per cent, and to \u00a3131,729 in 1877-78 or 277\u00b741 per cent. Most of the great increase in 1878 is special, due to the large quantity of grain imported to meet the failure of crops in north Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The exports increased from \u00a333,713 in 1839-40 to \u00a377,816 in 1874-75 or 130\u00b781 per cent, and to \u00a390,017 in 1877-78 or 167\u00b701 per cent. The increase in 1877-78 is owing to large tobacco exports amounting to about six-sevenths of the whole export trade. Compared with the 1875 figures there is in 1878 a fall in many leading exports mainly due to the failure of local crops.\n\n**Imports.**\n\nThe chief imports are: unhulled rice d\u00e1ngar from the Konkan, cleaned rice chokha and wheat from Bombay, peas vat\u00e1na from Bilimora in Surat, and b\u00e1cto Panicum frumentaceum from Bals\u00e1r, piece goods, clarified butter, molasses chiefly from Bals\u00e1r and Bilimora, silk, timber chiefly from Bals\u00e1r, Bilimora, and Daman, sugar chiefly from Bombay, cocoanuts chiefly from Bombay and the Konkan, dried fruit from Bombay and Ver\u00e1val in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, metal from Bombay, and carnelians from Broach. During the thirty-eight years ending 1878, the import of grain fell from\n\u00a33277 to \u00a31360 in 1875, and, from special circumstances, rose to \u00a346,968 in 1878; molasses rose from \u00a35221 to \u00a314,021 in 1875, and to \u00a311,459 in 1878; piece goods fell from \u00a31565 to \u00a3712 in 1875, and again rose to \u00a318,123; silk fell from \u00a3284 to \u00a35 in 1875, and again rose to \u00a34886; sugar rose from \u00a32070 to \u00a33542 in 1875 and \u00a33957 in 1878; and metal fell from \u00a31960 to \u00a31130 in 1875, but has again risen to \u00a32802. On the other hand there is a fall in the import of cotton yarn from \u00a33397 to \u00a31293 in 1875 and \u00a377 in 1878; of dried fruit from \u00a31570 to \u00a3307; of coconuts from \u00a33106 to \u00a33087; and of carnelians from \u00a31785 to \u00a31440. In 1840 salt valued at \u00a3122 was imported. This import has ceased. Of fresh imports are, clarified butter worth \u00a311,882; mahuda flower, \u00a3510; tobacco, \u00a3880; soap, \u00a347; cotton seed, \u00a3124 in 1875 and \u00a3152 in 1878; and matches, \u00a3350 in 1875 and \u00a31019 in 1878.\n\nThe chief exports are: tobacco, sent south as far as Kolaba and chiefly to Daman and Bombay, west to Kathiawar, and north to Cutch; clarified butter, carnelians, and wooden bracelets to Bombay; grain, pulse, and Indian millet to Bilimora and Bombay; and piece goods, especially black cloth. During the last thirty-eight years, the figures show a rise in the export of tobacco from \u00a311,105 to \u00a376,287; of clarified butter from \u00a3353 to \u00a3570; of carnelians from \u00a3369 to \u00a3519; and of wooden bracelets from \u00a324 to \u00a346. On the other hand there is a fall in the exports of piece goods from \u00a315,827 to \u00a3191 in 1878; and of grain from \u00a3448 to \u00a313. In 1840 soap worth \u00a32835, mahuda flower worth \u00a3488, stone worth \u00a3168, and salt worth \u00a375 were exported; of these there has been no export either in 1875 or in 1878. The export of grocery, valued at \u00a3517 in 1840 and at \u00a3543 in 1878; of dyes, valued at \u00a3501 in 1840 and at \u00a374 in 1878; and of cotton-yarn, valued at \u00a390 in 1840 and at \u00a36 in 1875, had ceased in 1878. Of fresh exports are cotton worth \u00a311 in 1875 and \u00a32310 in 1878, timber worth \u00a312, and metal worth \u00a37.\n\nIn 1878 the shipping of the Cambay port amounted in all to 566 vessels of a total burden of about 10,000 tons. The details are:\n\n| Port     | Came | Left |\n|----------|------|------|\n|          | Vessels | Tonnage | Vessels | Tonnage |\n|          | Total | Average | Total | Average |\n| Cutch    | 61   | 1364   | 22    | 18     | 393   | 24   |\n| Kathiawar| 58   | 510    | 8     | 59     | 654   | 11   |\n| Portuguese| 26   | 342    | 13    | 17     | 352   | 20   |\n| Gujar\u00e1t  | 249  | 3854   | 16    | 312    | 6487  | 17   |\n| Bombay   | 134  | 3319   | 24    | 138    | 2667  | 19   |\n| Konkan   | 40   | 710    | 17    | 24     | 330   | 16   |\n| Total    | 566  | 10,099 | 17    | 663    | 9933  | 17   |\n\nThese vessels are all coasting craft, chiefly batel\u00e1s. Boats of six tons and under can make the port of Cambay at all ordinary high tides, and vessels of from seven to fifty tons at springs. Ships of more than fifty tons never visit Cambay.\nThe trade with Gujar\u00e1t and Central India that formerly passed through Cambay has, since the opening of the Bombay and Ahmedabad railway (1863), almost entirely left its former route. For several years Cambay trade was entirely local, gathering exports and spreading imports within a radius of about forty miles. The special grain demand, caused in 1878 by the north Gujar\u00e1t scarcity, showed how readily a great sea trade might again spring up. Over 4600 tons of grain were imported, and, chiefly because on the return voyage they were able to offer specially low rates, the boats gained an unusual share of the tobacco and cotton exports.\n\nMANUFACTURES.\n\nThe fame of Cambay manufactures has long passed away. There remain only agate ornaments and cotton cloth.\n\nThe working in precious stones is the most interesting of Cambay industries. The term 'Cambay Stones' includes two classes of gems; agates found in different parts of Gujar\u00e1t within a radius of about 120 miles of Cambay; miscellaneous foreign stones brought to Cambay to be worked by its lapidaries. Of the first class the most important is the agate, known from its fleshy colour, as carnelian. In its natural state, of a dull cloudy brown or yellow, the carnelian is in Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed called gh\u00e1r and when worked up akik. Carnelians are found within R\u00e1jpipla limits, on the left bank of the Narbada, about fourteen miles above Broach. The mines are on the sloping side of a small sandstone hill known as the B\u00e1wa Ghori or B\u00e1wa Ab\u00e1s hill, perhaps Ptolemy's (150) Agate Mountain. The borings show a surface bed of gravel with red and yellow ochre below; under these fuller's earth and red ochre; then a thin seam of iron-bearing rock; and last the carnelian clay. The mine shafts are about four feet in diameter, and on an average about thirty feet deep. At the foot of each shaft, galleries five feet high and four feet wide, branch off on all sides. These passages, seldom more than a hundred\n\n---\n\n1 This account is compiled from Hove's Tours (1787), Bom. Gov. Sel. XVI. 49-51; Milburn's Or. Com. (1813), I. 278; Captain Fulljames (1832), Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. II. 76, 77; and Mr. Summers (1848), Bom. Gov. Sel. IV. 15.\n\n2 The agate is a quartz stone usually containing from seventy to ninety-six per cent of silica, with various proportions of alumina coloured by oxide of iron or manganese. It is generally found in round nodules or in veins in trap rocks. The number of agate balls it contains often gives a rock the character of amygdaloid, and when such a rock is decomposed, the agates drop out and are found in the beds of streams. The chief varieties of agates are: (1) calcedony with the colours in parallel bars; (2) carnelian or red calcedony; (3) Mokha stones; (4) moss agates; (5) bloodstone; (6) plasma, a grass-green stone probably a calcedony coloured by chlorite; and (7) chrysoprase, an apple-green stone coloured by oxide of nickel. The English word agate is generally derived from the Greek \u1f00\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, said to be the name of a stream in Sicily once famous for agates. A more probable origin is the Arabic akik a river bed. In very early times (180 A.D.) agates were brought from Arabia to Rome (Vincent, II. 751).\n\n3 From the details of the Broach, Barugaza, agate trade given in the Periplus (247) (McCrindle, 126), it seems probable that Ptolemy's Agate Hill was further inland in the Deccan or Central Provinces whence the best agates still come. (See below, p. 205).\n\n4 The formation containing carnelian, stretching over about four miles, is a deep bed of red gravel, very like London gravel. In it calcedony pebbles of various form and size are irregularly imbedded. (Dr. Lush, 1836. Jour. As. Soc. Beng. V. 2, 766). In 1842 Mr. Orlebar found that, from the decay of the trade, the mines had been given up, and the holes filled in, so that he could not examine the strata. Jour. Bom. As. Soc. I. 195.\nyards long, in many cases join the galleries of other mines. Every mine has a band of thirteen men, each with a small iron pickaxe, a few bamboo baskets, and a rope. They work in turns, and, before he is relieved, each man must fill a certain number of baskets. The basket is drawn up by a rude roller or pulley supported by four uprights. At the mine mouth the stones are chipped, and the likely ones carried to Ratanpur, the village of gems, and there made over to the contractor or his agent. The average outturn of two men working from eight to ten hours, is from ten to forty pounds weight of stones.\n\nThe contractor divides the stones into two classes, those which should and those which should not be baked. Three stones are left unbaked: an onyx called *mora* or *b\u00e1wa ghori*, the cat's-eye called *cheshamd\u00e1r* or *dola*, and a yellow half-clear pebble called *rori* or *lasania*. Of these the *mora* or *b\u00e1wa ghori* onyx\\(^1\\) is of two kinds, one dark with white veins, the other greyish white with dark veins. These stones are found in different shapes, and seldom more than one pound in weight. Except these three varieties, all Ratanpur pebbles are baked to bring out their colour. During the hot season, generally in March and April, the stones are spread in the sun in an open field. Then in May, a trench, two feet deep by three wide, is dug round the field. The pebbles are gathered into earthen pots, which, with their mouths down and a hole broken in their bottoms, are set in a row in the trench. Round the pots goat and cowdung cakes are piled, and the whole is kept burning from sunset to sunrise. Then the pots are taken out, the stones examined, and the good ones stowed in bags. About the end of May the bags are carted to the Narbada, and floated to Broach. Here they are shipped in large vessels for Cambay, and are offered for sale to the carnelian dealers. The right of working the R\u00e1jpipla mines is every year put up to auction. It would of late seem to have become more valuable as the average for the last four years (1873-1876) has been \u00a3323 (Rs. 3230) compared with \u00a3189 (Rs. 1890) in the twenty previous years. The contractors are generally Baroda and Cambay merchants, V\u00e1ni\u00e1s and Bohor\u00e1s by caste.\n\nBy exposure to sun and fire, among browns the light shades brighten into white, and the darker deepen into chestnut. Of yellows, maize gains a rosy tint, orange is intensified into red, and an intermediate shade of yellow becomes pinkish purple. Pebbles in which cloudy browns and yellows were at first mixed are now marked by clear bands of white and red. The hue of the red carnelian varies from the palest flesh to the deepest blood red. The best are a deep clear and even red, free from cracks, flaws, or veins. The larger and thicker the stone, the more it is esteemed. White carnelians are scarce. When large, thick, even coloured, and free from flaws, they are valuable. Yellow and variegated stones are worth little.\n\nFour agates, the common, the moss, the Kapadvanj, and the veined, rank next to the R\u00e1jpipla carnelians. The Common Agate is of two kinds, a white half-clear stone called *dola* or *cheshamd\u00e1r*,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The true or Sulim\u00e1ni onyx comes to Cambay from Jabalpur.\nand a cloudy or streaked stone called j\u00e1mo. The colour varies, but is generally a greyish white. Both kinds come from north-east K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, near Mahedpur in Morvi, three miles from Tank\u00e1ra.\n\nOf the stones, which lie in massive blocks near the surface, the most perfect do not exceed five pounds in weight, while those of inferior quality, in many cases cracked, weigh as much as sixty pounds. These stones are brought to the Cambay dealers by merchants, who, paying a royalty to the Morvi chief, hire labourers, generally Kolis, to gather them. When worked up, the common agate is a greyish white, and being hard, brittle, and massive, it takes a high polish.\n\nMoss Agates.\n\nLike the common agate, the Moss Agate, sua bh\u00e1ji, comes from Bud Kotra, three miles from Tank\u00e1ra in Morvi. Found in the plain about two feet under the surface in massive layers often cracked and from half a pound to forty pounds in weight, they are gathered in the same way as the common agate. When worked up they take a fine polish, showing, on a base of crystal sometimes clear, sometimes clouded, tracings as of dark-green or red-brown moss.\n\nKapadvanj Agates.\n\nBesides from the town of Kapadvanj in Kaira, where, as its name shows, the Kapadvanj agate is chiefly found, this stone is brought from the bed of the river M\u00e1jam, between the villages of \u00c1mliy\u00e1ra and M\u00e1ndva, about fifteen miles from Kapadvanj. It is found on the banks and in the beds of rivers, in round, kidney, and almond shaped balls from half a pound to ten pounds in weight. Picked up by Bhils, they are sold to a M\u00e1ndva Bohora who disposes of them to the Cambay stone merchants at from 6s. to 24s. for forty pounds (Rs. 3-12 a man). When worked up the Kapadvanj agate takes a high polish. It varies much in colour and pattern. In some cases they are variegated, in others they have forms of finely marked plants grouped into landscape and other views. The trade names of the chief varieties are kh\u00e1riyu, \u00e1j\u00edyu, and r\u00e1tad\u00edu.\n\nVeined Agates.\n\nThe most valued Cambay agate, the Veined Agate, dor\u00e1d\u00e1r, comes from R\u00e1npur in Ahmedabad. Found near the surface, in pebbles of various shapes not more than half a pound in weight, they are gathered in the same way as moss agates, and when worked up, take a high polish, showing either a dark ground with white streaks, or dark veins on a light background.\n\nMiscellaneous.\n\nOf other Cambay stones the chief are: the jasper or bloodstone, the chocolate stone, a variegated pebble known as m\u00e1imariam, crystal, the lapis-lazuli or azure stone, the obsidian or jet, and the blue stone, piroja. Of these the first four are found in Gujar\u00e1t. The rest are foreign stones brought from Bombay. The Jasper, Heliotrope, or Bloodstone comes from the village of Tank\u00e1ra in Morvi, about twenty miles north of R\u00e1jkot. Found on and near the foot of Bh\u00e1g hill, in massive layers of from half a pound to forty pounds, it is gathered in the same way as the agate. When worked up it takes a high polish, varying in colour from lila chh\u00e1ntd\u00e1r a green variety with red streaks or spots, to the finer patol\u00eda whose green base is more equally mixed with red and yellow. The Chocolate Stone, r\u00e1lhia, comes from Tank\u00e1ra in Morvi.\nFound on the surface, or a few feet underground, in masses of from one to eight pounds, it is too soft and earthy to take a high polish. *M\u00e1imariam* is a liver brown, marbled with yellowish marks of shells and animalcul\u00e6. Dug in blocks of considerable size at Dhokov\u00e1da on the Ran of Cutch about sixty miles north of Deesa, it is too soft to take a high polish. Cambay Crystal, *phatak*, comes from Tank\u00e1ra in Morvi, where it is found in masses of from one to twenty pounds. As clear as glass it takes a high polish. The best Cambay crystal comes from Madras, Ceylon, and China. Lapis-lazuli, or Azure Stone, *r\u00e1j\u00e1varat*, is deep blue with a sprinkling of silvery or golden spots. A foreign stone coming to Cambay through Bombay, it is found in rounded balls in Persian and Bukh\u00e1r\u00e1n river beds. It is too soft and earthy to take a high polish. Jet, or Black Stone, *k\u00e1l\u00e1 phatar*, is also foreign coming through Bombay from the hills of Bassora and Aden, where it is found in large blocks. Like glass in fracture, it is not very heavy, and takes a high polish. The Cambay jet trade has almost entirely ceased. The Cambay Blue Stone is not the true *piroja*, but a composition imported from China in flat pieces of not more than half a pound in weight. Like blue glass in appearance, though soft it takes a good polish.\n\nThe rough stone generally passes through three processes: sawing, chiselling, and polishing. When a stone is to be sawn it is brought to a strong frame of two wooden uprights, joined at the foot by a cross board, and, at the top, by a strong rope doubled and tightened by a stick. The stone is then laid on the cross board, and fixed firmly to it by a cement of coarse bees' wax and cloth fibres. The saw, a slight toothless iron plate in a light wooden frame, is then brought up, and, according to the size of the stone, is worked by one or two men. To smooth its freshly-cut faces, a mixture of ground emery, fine sand, and water, is kept dropping into the cleft in which the saw works. To chisel it into shape the stone is taken to a slanting iron spike, *khondia*, driven into the ground till only the head is left above the surface. Laying against the edge of this spike the part of the stone to be broken off, the workman strikes with a horn-headed hammer till all roughness has been removed. The article is now handed over to the polisher. He takes it to a platform sixteen inches long by six broad and three thick. In this platform are two strong wooden uprights, and between the uprights a wooden roller, eight inches long and three in diameter, fastened into a head at one end. This roller works on an iron spindle or axle. On the one end, the axle is screwed and fitted with a nut to which certain plates or discs can be made fast. These grinding or polishing plates are made of emery mixed with seed lac. The emery, *karanj*, of greyish black, is carefully powdered and glistening. The preparation of emery varies in fineness according to the nature of the work. For rough work the proportion is three parts of ground emery to one of lac; for medium work the proportion is two and a half pounds of finely powdered emery to one of lac; and, for the finest work, lac and carnelian dust, *vari*, are used in equal quantities. Besides the composition plates, a\ncopper disc is occasionally used for polishing very hard stone, such as Ceylon cat's-eyes and other precious stones, and for the softer sort of pebbles, a plate of teak or other closegrained wood is used. Fastening in its place on the roller the disc best suited to the stone to be polished, the workman, squatting on his hams, steadies the machine with his foot. A bow, with its string passed round the wooden roller, is held in his right hand, and by moving the bow backwards and forwards, the roller and with it the polishing plate is whirled round, while the article to be polished is held in the workman's left hand, and, as it revolves, is pressed against the outer face of the polishing disc.\n\nBesides these three regular processes, certain articles require special treatment. After beads have been chiselled into shape, to smooth their surface, a number are fixed in a pair of wooden or bamboo clamps, and rubbed on a coarse and hard smoothing stone called dholia. Next they are grasped in a grooved clamp, and rubbed along a wooden polishing board called patim\u00e1r. The surface of this board is cut into grooves, and roughened by a composition of emery and seed lac. To give beads their final brilliancy, from one to several thousands of them, are, along with emery dust and fine carnelian powder, thrown into a strong leather bag about two feet long and from ten to twelve inches across. The mouth of the bag is tied, and a flat leather thong is passed round its centre. Seated at opposite ends of a room, two men, each holding one end of this leather thong, drag the bag backwards and forwards. This rolling lasts from ten to fifteen days, and during the whole time the bag is kept moistened with water. When the polishing is complete, the beads are handed over to have holes bored. This is done by a diamond-tipped steel drill, and as the drill works, water is dropped into the hole through a thin narrow reed or metal tube. Cut beads are polished on the wheel as well as rubbed on the smoothing stone, and knife-handles are prepared in the same way as cut beads. In making cups, saucers, and other hollow articles, the outside is first chiselled into shape and ground on the smoothing stone. To hollow the inside, the diamond-tipped drill is worked to the depth of the fourth of an inch all over the space, till the surface is honeycombed with drill holes. The prominent places round these holes are then chipped away till a hollow of the desired depth has been formed. The inside is then polished on a convex mould, of the same composition as the polishing plates, and like them fastened to the polishing wheel. Miniature cannons are bored by diamond-tipped drills. A smallheaded drill is first worked, and then the number of diamonds on the head is gradually increased from two to a circle of twelve. Flat ornaments, such as paper-cutters, paper-weights and ornamental slabs, are cut into layers of the required thickness by the toothless saw.\n\nCambay agate ornaments belong to three classes: those suited for the Chinese, the Arab, and the European markets.\u00b9 For the\n\n\u00b9 In 1787, seal shaped stones went to Europe and Arabia, pearl shaped stones as big as a pistol ball, to China, and octagons to the Guinea Coast and Mozambique. Hove's Tours : Bom. Gov. Sel. XVI. 49.\nChinese market, carnelian ornaments only are in demand. Of these there are two kinds, flat stones named mugl\u0101igul, and beads called dol. The flat stones, oval, square, and like watch seals, are worn in China as armlets and dress ornaments. Plain polished round beads are made into necklaces of fifty stones each. For the Arab markets, the stones most in demand are R\u00e1npur agates, Ratanpur carnelians, cat\u2019s-eyes, and bloodstone. These are wrought into both plain and ornamental ring stones, necklaces, wristlets, and armlets. Of necklaces there are those made of cut beads, pelud\u00e1r dol; of diamond-cut beads, gokhrud\u00e1r dol; of almond-shaped beads, bad\u00e1mi dol; and of spearhead-shaped beads, chamakli dol. Again there are necklaces of three stones called m\u00e1dul\u00eda or twit, and of plain round beads used as rosaries as well as necklaces. Of armlets and wristlets there are those of two stones, mota m\u00e1dalia worn either on the arm or wrist; wristlets of seven round flat stones, p\u00e1ti\u00e1; wristlets of several flat stones, ponchi; armlets of one stone cut into different fanciful devices, b\u00e1ju; and single stones in the shape of large flat seals, nimgol. Rings, anguthi, and stones for setting as rings, nagina, are also made of carnelian and cat\u2019s-eye. For the European markets, the ornaments most in demand are models of cannon with carriage and trappings, slabs for boxes or square tables, cups and saucers, chessmen, flower vases, pen racks, card and letter racks, watch stands, inkstands, knife-handles, rulers, paper-cutters, penholders, necklaces, bracelets, brooches, paper weights, crochet needles, silk-winders, marbles, brace and shirt studs, seals, and rough stones polished on one side. Within the last thirty years (1851) part of the trade with Arabia lay through Ver\u00e1val in south-west K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. At present (1878), except a very small supply for the Sind and C\u00e1b\u00fal markets taken by the horse-dealers and other Afgh\u00e1ns who visit Cambay, the whole produce is bought by Bombay merchants, chiefly of the Bohora caste, and by them sent from Bombay to China, Arabia, and Europe.\n\nAccording to the latest details, the trade in Cambay stones at present supports about six hundred families of skilled workmen, and from five hundred to six hundred unskilled labourers. The skilled workmen are all Kanbis, the labourers Musalm\u00e1ns and Kol\u00eds. The whole body of skilled workmen includes four distinct classes, each engaged on a separate process. Compared with the 1850 returns, the figures for 1878 show a fall, from two to one hundred in the number of polishers on the rough stone, dol\u00edas. On the other hand the workers on the lapidaries\u2019 wheel, gh\u00e1si\u00e1s, have remained steady at three hundred, the drillers, vindh\u00e1rs, at one hundred, and the polishers on the wooden frame, patim\u00e1rs, at fifty.\n\n---\n\n1 Jet ornaments were formerly (1851) exported to Arabia; of late years the trade has ceased.\n2 The demand for necklaces of oblong flat beads, katli, is said to have ceased.\n3 Within the last thirty years about 167 families of agate workers have abandoned their craft. Of these, seven have gone to Ahmedabad; ten to Baroda; twenty-five to Bombay; and 125 have become cultivators in Cambay. Those in Ahmedabad have taken to silk-weaving; those in Baroda to tobacco-selling, polishing precious stones, and weaving; those in Bombay to stone-polishing and glass-mending. The Bombay settlers still keep up their connection with Cambay, going there for marriage and\nEach process is carried on in a distinct workshop. At the head of each workshop, k\u00e1rkh\u00e1n\u00e1, is a well-to-do Kanbi known as the k\u00e1rkh\u00e1n\u00e1v\u00e1l\u00e1, or head of the factory. This headman, though generally not above working with his own hands, has under him, besides a varying number of labourers, from two to ten skilled workers. The skilled workers, all grown men, as women and children do not help, receive monthly wages each according to the work he has done; the unskilled labourers, many of them boys, are paid by the day or as their services are wanted. From the richest of the workshop heads, the highest class of agate workers, the agate dealers, akik\u00ed\u00e1s, are recruited. The akik\u00eda, who must be a man of some capital, buys the stones as they come rough into the Cambay market. In his factory the rough stones are sawn and chiselled, and then, according to the nature of the stone and the use to which it is to be put, he hands it over to the headman of one of the polishing factories. When the work is completed, the Cambay dealer disposes of the finished articles to the agate merchants of Bombay, or sends them through Bombay, to Calcutta, Chine, or Jadda. According to the returns, the number of agate dealers, akik\u00ed\u00e1s, in Cambay has, during the last twenty-five years, fallen from one hundred to fifty.\n\nIn each branch of the craft the heads of factories form a distinct guild or panch\u00e1yat. There is the guild of polishers on stone, dolia panch\u00e1yat; of polishers on wood, patim\u00e1r panch\u00e1yat; of workers on the lapidaries\u2019 wheel, gh\u00e1sia panch\u00e1yat; and of drillers, vindh\u00e1r panch\u00e1yat. Above them is the dealers\u2019 guild, akik\u00eda panch\u00e1yat, in whose factories the work of sawing and chiselling is carried on. Over each of these guilds a headman, chosen by the votes of the members, presides. There is no combination among the workers in the different factories, and there is no record of any dispute between the workers and their employers. Any skilled worker who raises himself to be head of a factory, may become a member of the guild of the branch of the craft to which he belongs. On joining a guild the new comer is expected to give a feast to the members, the expense varying from \u00a317 10s. to \u00a380 (Rs. 175 - 800). He is at the same time required to pay the Naw\u00e1b a fee of from \u00a31 10s. to \u00a310 (Rs. 15-100). From time to time the members of a guild hold a feast meeting the charges out of the common funds. In any factory, if one of the skilled workers wishes to have a son taught the craft, or, if a new hand is anxious to join, he gives a dinner to the head of the workshop and to the other skilled workers. Except in making arrangements for the unpaid service due to the Naw\u00e1b, the trade funds would seem to be applied\n\ndeath ceremonies. They have also, both publicly and in their houses, shrines representing the tomb of the founder of their craft. (These and some of the particulars about the trade unions have been obtained from one of the Kanbis settled in Bombay).\n\n1 Some years ago the details were, to join the dolia guild, \u00a319 (\u00a317 10s. in dinners and \u00a31 10s. for the Naw\u00e1b); to join the gh\u00e1sia guild, \u00a337 (\u00a335 in dinners and \u00a32 for the Naw\u00e1b); to join the patim\u00e1r guild, \u00a315 (\u00a312 10s. in dinners and \u00a32 10s. for the Naw\u00e1b); and to join the akik\u00eda guild, \u00a390 (\u00a380 in dinners and \u00a310 for the Naw\u00e1b). At present (1876) a fee is paid to the Naw\u00e1b only on joining the akik\u00eda guild.\nto no purpose but that of entertaining the members. When a guild feast is held, if one of its members chances to be sick, his share of the dinner is sent him. With this exception, the practice of using trade funds to support the sick or those out of work, or to provide for widows and orphans, is unknown.\n\nOn paying the Naw\u00e1b a fee, and agreeing to meet the customary charges including a yearly subscription of \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 12), any member of one of the under-guilds may become a dealer, akikia. About four years ago, the heavy cost of joining the akikia guild caused a dispute. Certain of the polishers, gh\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1s, claimed the right to deal in stones without becoming members of the akikia guild. The regular dealers were too strong for them, and, failing to get any business, they were forced to leave Cambay. With some families of drillers they retired to Ahmedabad. But, finding themselves no better off there, they returned to Cambay.\n\nThe guilds are useful in arranging for the service due to the Naw\u00e1b. When the Naw\u00e1b wants a lapidary, he tells the dealers\u2019 guild what work he wishes done. The chief of the dealers sends to the master of one workshop in each branch of the craft, telling him what is wanted, and asking him if he will undertake the duty. If he agrees, and there is generally in each class one master-worker who undertakes the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s orders, he receives from \u00a35 to \u00a36 (Rs. 50-60) from the guild funds. Among guild rules, one forbids master-workers engaging the services of workmen belonging to another factory. Another lays down certain days, amounting in all to about two months in the year, to be kept as holidays. Breaches of the rules are punished by fines varying from 2s. 6d. to 5s. (Rs. 1\u00bd-2\u00bd).\n\nSome authorities hold that the murrhine cups so highly prized by the Romans, were the moss agate cups still made in Cambay. Others hold that, under the name Sardonyx Mons, Ptolemy (150) referred to the R\u00e1jpipla mines. But Ptolemy\u2019s Sardonyx hills are far inland, and when the author of the Periplus (247) visited Gujar\u00e1t, agates and onyx stones came to Broach from a distance, from \u00dajain in M\u00e1lwa and from Plith\u00e1na (Paithan) in the Deccan.\n\n---\n\n1 Vincent (Commerce of the Ancients, II. 407, 412) thinks murha was porcelain; Riddle\u2019s Latin Dictionary calls it fluor spar; Liddell and Scott incline to agate. The Emperor Nero paid \u00a358,125 (300 talents) for a murrhine cup. (Vincent, II. 727). According to Pliny (77 A.D.) Indian agates had many wonderful qualities. They were good for scorpion bites, had the appearance of rivers, woods, beasts of burden, and forms like ivy. The sight of them was good for the eyes, and held in the mouth they allayed thirst. Bostock\u2019s Pliny, VI. 440. Herodotus (484 B.C.) speaks of the sard and onyx being brought from India to be used as finger rings. Every one in Babylon wore agate rings (Lassen\u2019s Ind. Alt. II. 562). Lassen traces a reference to the Cambay agate trade in Vaidurya, that is an onyx, an old Sanskrit name for west India from the Narbada to Gokarna. Ind. Alt.

Plith\u00e1na, probably Paithan on the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri (north latitude 19\u00b0 29' east longitude 75\u00b0 28'). A trace of this Deccan manufacture of agates is preserved by the Russian traveller Athanasius Nikot\u00edn (1468-1474), who says, at Kurula, apparently near Gubargah, the akik is produced and worked and exported to all parts of the world. (Major\u2019s India in the XVth Century, III. 30). Neobold (Jour. R. A. Soc. IX. 37) mentions that carnelians, Mocha stone, and Moss agate are found in the Krishna, God\u00e1v\u00e1ri, and Bhima.\nSo far as has been traced, the Musalm\u00e1n travellers of the ninth and tenth centuries make no mention of an agate trade at Cambay.\\(^1\\) Marco Polo (1290) says nothing of a special agate trade, either in his description of Cambay or in the notices of the Arabian and African ports then connected by commerce with Gujar\u00e1t. The fifteenth century travellers make only a casual reference to the agate as one of the products of Cambay. Early in the sixteenth century, the agate trade seems to have risen to importance. Varthema (1503-1508) speaks of two mountains, one of carnelians about seventy, the other of diamonds about one hundred miles, from Cambay.\\(^2\\) About this time, according to a tradition of the Cambay agate workers, an Abyssinian merchant came to Gujar\u00e1t, and established an agate factory at N\u00e1ndod in R\u00e1jpipla. At first the stones were prepared by Musalm\u00e1ns, but the Kanbis were not long in learning the craft. The merchant died at N\u00e1ndod, and his tomb is near the well known tomb of B\u00e1wa Ghor at the ford of that name across the river Narbada. After some time, according to the same account, the Kanbi agate workers left N\u00e1ndod and came to settle in Broach, and from Broach went to Cambay.\\(^3\\) A few years later, at the different east African and Arabian ports, the Portuguese traveller Barbosa (1514) mentions the agates and carnelians, and the grey, yellow, and red beads of Cambay as among the chief articles of trade.\\(^4\\) At Cambay itself, besides some Moorish women who worked in coral, agate, and other stones, this traveller found skilled artists with the lathe turning beads of great size, brown, yellow, and blue, and cunning lapidaries and imitators of precious stones of all kinds. At this time few of the agate workers were settled in Cambay. Their headquarters were at Limadura (Limodra or Nimodra), a town inland from Cambay, where the agates were found. At Limadura the polished stones were bought by Cambay merchants and sent to the Red Sea, Persia, and Nubia, besides supplying the Portuguese, who\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) M\u00e1sudi (913), who says nothing of its agates, mentions an emerald, beautifully green and brilliant, found near Cambay. It was called makk\u00ed because the Arabs carried it from India to Aden and on to Mokha. Prairies d'Or, III. 49. A doubtful passage would seem to show that in the eighth century, Gujar\u00e1t was so famous for its agates as to be called Akikshetra or agate land.

So C\u00e9sar Frederic (1585), among the products of Cambay, talks of several varieties of natural diamonds. Hakluyt's Voyages, II. 343.\n\n\\(^3\\) The Sidi merchant is still remembered by the Hindu agate workers. Each year on the day of his death Shravan sud purnima (July-August full-moon), they offer flowers and cocoanuts at his tomb. As it is far to go from Cambay to B\u00e1wa Ghor, they have in Cambay a cenotaph, takiya, in his honour, and those of them who are settled in Bombay have brought with them this memorial of the founder of their craft. The Cambay agate workers assert that the well known shrine of B\u00e1wa Ghor was raised in honour of their patron. According to their story, while wandering from place to place as a religious beggar, the B\u00e1wa did business in precious stones, and, becoming skilled in agates, set up a factory at Nimodra. Here he prospered and died rich. The local legend of the saint of Bawa Ghor makes no mention of his success as an agate dealer. The colony of Sid\u00eds found by Captain Fulljames in 1832 was, perhaps, a remnant of the original band of Abyssinian agate workers. Trans. Bom. Geo. Soc. 2-76.\n\n\\(^4\\) Stanley's Barbosa, 5, 27, 31. Barbosa's word for the agate is, in Stanley's translation, printed alaquequa. This word probably comes from the Arabic al akik.\nare said to have increased the demand. Two other notices of its agate trade occur in sixteenth century accounts of Cambay. One in 1554 speaks of a profusion of carnelians, *b\u0101b\u0101ghor*. The other, about twenty years later, mentions great stones like to carnelians, granates, agates, diaspory, chalcedony, hematists, and some kinds of natural diamonds. In the beginning of the seventeenth century (1611), in Goa all precious stone workers were from Cambay and had separate streets and shops. Forty years later (1651) Tavernier speaks of Cambay as the place where the agate cups are hollowed, and, during the eighteenth century, there is more than one notice of the agate trade as one of the most important of Cambay industries.\n\nFor a few years, during the present century, details are available showing the estimated value of the outturn of the agate factories. Those for 1805 give an export of manufactured carnelians, estimated at \u00a36223 (Rs. 62,230); those for 1843 give \u00a39490 (Rs. 94,900); and the returns for the five years ending 1878 an average of about \u00a37000 (Rs. 70,000).\n\n---\n\n1 Stanley's Barbosa, 65-67. Limadura is Nimodra, a village close to the R\u0101jpipla agate mines. Barbosa gives the following details of the preparation of the agates. After being dug up in large blocks, and exposed to fire to bring out the colour, the carnelians are handed over to great artists who work them into rings, buttons, knife-handles, and beads. Here, too, chalcedony beads which, he adds, they call *b\u0101b\u0101ghor*, were worn touching the skin, as they were thought to keep the wearer chaste.\n\n2 Sidi Ali Kapudhan (1554), Jour. As. Soc. Beng. V, 2, 463. Cesar Frederic (1585), Hakluyt's Voyages, II. 214, 220.\n\n3 Pyrard de Laval : Voyages, II. 214, 220.\n\n4 Tavernier in Harris, II. 353. 'Here they shape those fair agates that come from India, into cups, knife hafts, beads and other sorts of workmanship. These agates are fetched out of the quarries by a village named Nimodra sixteen miles from Cambay, in pieces as big as a man's fist.' Besides Laval and Tavernier, other travellers of the seventeenth century notice the Cambay agate trade. Finch (1608) mentions the mine of agates near Broach (Harris, I. 90); Herbert (1626) notices agates as one of the chief articles offered for sale at Swali (Harris, I. 411); Mandelslo (1638) speaks of them as 'so famous in Europe' (Harris, II. 113); Ogilby (1670, Atlas, V. 216) says, six days from Cambay is a mountain which produces carnelians and chalcedony, and a league from Broach is another chalcedony mine; and Ovington (1690) cites them as one of the chief articles of export at Surat. (Voyages, 218). Of eighteenth century travellers, Hamilton (1700-1720) mentions, among articles made at Cambay, stones for signets and rings some of them worth double their weight in gold, cabinets of stone, in some cases fourteen or fifteen inches long and eight or nine deep, worth from \u00a330 to \u00a340, bowls and spoons of several sizes, handles of swords, daggers, and knives, buttons and stones to set in snuff boxes of great value. (New Account, I. 140, 145). Half a century later (1750), Tiefenthaler says that the white Ratanpur agate, baked red at the mines, was in Broach and Cambay, worked into vases, little plates, basins, and other pieces, and sold in Surat and thence taken to Europe. He also notices Kapadvanj agates worked in Cambay into different figures and made into vases, plates, and saucers. (Res. Hist. et Geog. de l'Inde, I. 390, 392). About the same time, the author of the *Mir\u0101t-i-Ahmadi* (1748-1762) mentions rings like those of Yemen, necklaces, cups, handles for knives, and daggers (Bird, 104). Towards the close of the same century, Forbes (1783) found the agate manufacture a valuable part of Cambay trade. (Or. Mem. II. 20).\n\n5 These figures would seem to show that, during the present century, the agate trade has not declined, a result at variance with the fact that the numbers engaged in the trade have considerably fallen off. It is to be noticed that the beginning of the century was a period of depression, as, in addition to the regular duty of \u00a333 16s. 3d. per cent, a special war cess of \u00a317 8s. 9d. was for some years imposed, making a total charge on manufactured agate stones of \u00a371 5s. per cent. The trade fluctuates so greatly from year to year, that, without returns for a series of years, no certain results can be obtained. The variations during the eight years ending 1878 were : 1871, Rs. 75,080 ; 1872, Rs. 78,490 ; 1873, Rs. 98,840 ; 1874, Rs. 84,370 ; 1875, Rs. 90,720 ; 1876, Rs. 53,160 ; 1877, Rs. 69,170 ; and 1878, Rs. 50,970. Figures taken\nChapter II.\nManufactures.\n\nCloth.\n\nA certain quantity of the once famous black cloth, *k\u00e1la kapda*, is still made for export to Zanzibar in Africa, and to Mokha, Jadda, and other Red Sea ports. Of black cloth there are three kinds, known in the trade as *bad\u00e1mi*, *garthi*, and *mum juddh*, costing from 6s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 3-12) the piece of five yards long and one and a half wide. There is also a blue cloth called *gulkh\u00e1r*. Several kinds of sheets, *ch\u00e1dar*, are made in pieces about two and a quarter yards long by one broad, and varying in price from 4s. to 16s. (Rs. 2-8). Scarfs, *lungis* (sometimes called *namid\u00e1nus*), are also made. The pieces, of the same size as *ch\u00e1dars*, are sold at prices varying according to quality. Those worked with silk and tinsel fetch \u00a31 (Rs. 10). The only Cambay cloth still in request is that used for *dhotis* and *s\u00e1dis*. This is woven almost entirely by Hindus of the Kanbi and S\u00e1lvi castes. The prices vary according to quality and breadth.\n\nCarpets.\n\nCambay carpets had once a great name. Among the articles mentioned in the proclamation of 1630, \u2018for restraining the excess of private trade to the East Indies\u2019, are \u2018rich carpets of Cambay\u2019. Later on, a chief part of the Senior Factor\u2019s duty at Cambay was to buy carpets \u2018valuable in Europe\u2019; and, in another place, Cambay carpets are spoken of as equal to any of Turkey or Persia. Though this trade has greatly fallen off, there are still four carpet factories, each paying the Naw\u00e1b a yearly tax of \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15).\n\nEmbroidery.\n\nSome Muhammadan women still earn a little by embroidering children\u2019s caps, but the weaving of brocade and cloth of gold has ceased.\n\nSalt.\n\nTill lately (1880) the Cambay salt works contributed about one-sixth of the state revenue. They lay inland, beyond the city walls, about two and a half miles from the head of the gulf. The pans, covering a space about two miles long, and on an average a quarter of a mile broad, were surrounded by a row of earthen mounds, gradually formed by the earth scraped from the pans. Formerly, at spring tides, the sea water came up to this embankment, and by suitable cuttings as much water as was needed was easily obtained. Latterly, owing to the gradual silting of the gulf, the spring tides failed to reach the embankment, and, to get water,\n\n---\n\nfrom the Honourable East India Company\u2019s yearly sales show that, at the beginning of the century, the fluctuations were even greater: 1804, Rs. 49,140; 1805, Rs. 59,900; 1806, Rs. 17,470; 1807, Rs. 1,11,870; 1808, Rs. 54,240.

The dyes used in carpet-making are safflower, *kasumba*, Carthamus tinctorius, Indian madder, *sorang\u00ed*, and indigo, imported from M\u00e1lwa and Gujar\u00e1t. The cotton thread is washed in cold water, and then dipped several times in boiling castor-oil. It is next soaked in water in which madder powder has been steeped. The cost of dyeing red is \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 12) for each 40 pounds of thread, and the cost of indigo dyeing about 16s. (Rs. 8) for 40 pounds. Weavers are paid by piece-work at the rate of 2s. (Re. 1) for 16 square feet (4 square *gaz*); and the carpets sell for 1s. 3d., to 2s. (10-16 annas) every 2 square feet.\n\n2 Besides the common salt, in the eighteenth century, the medicinal salt called *sanchal* is said to have been made at Cambay, by boiling a grass called *morand* in the manner usually followed in procuring the oxide of lead known as *murdd\u00e1rstng*. (Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 1748-1762, 105). *Sanchal* or *bit taban* is generally said to be made of *samur*, an impure muriate of soda, and emblem myrobalsans. Balfour\u2019s Cyclop\u00e6dia.\ntrenches had to be dug from a quarter to one mile long. Since 1878, on receiving a yearly payment of \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000), the Naw\u00e1b has closed his salt works. He is still allowed, for the use of his court, to produce up to 500 Indian mans of salt a year.\n\nMONEY LENDING.\n\nMoney-lending is chiefly in the hands of V\u00e1ni\u00e1s and Shravaks with a few Br\u00e1hmans and Kanbis. For merchants the yearly rate of interest is usually from six to twelve per cent, and for cultivators it is nearly the same, with a further premium of one or two per cent. If ornaments are pledged lower rates are taken.\n\nWhen the Naw\u00e1b is in want of money he obtains funds from the town bankers, who, if the loan is for only a short time, do not as a rule insist upon interest. If the loan is not paid for a long time, a low rate is charged, in no case more than nine per cent. The custom of presenting the lender with a sum of money or some articles of value at the time of repaying the loan, makes up to the banker for the low rates of interest. Large sums, raised on the occasion of a marriage or funeral in the Naw\u00e1b's family, are generally repaid by assigning the revenues of certain villages.\n\nThe Naw\u00e1b has a mint at which both silver and copper are coined. The silver coins are rupees, half rupees, and quarter rupees; the copper coins pice, half pice, and quarter pice. Both the silver and copper currency are of the rudest workmanship. The Cambay rupee is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the Imperial coin, the present (1880) rate of exchange being twenty-five per cent in favour of the British currency.\n\nA comparison of the available price returns shows a most marked rise in the value of field produce. The 1878 prices were, by local failure of crops, forced up almost to famine pitch. But, though 1876 was a year of plenty, prices ruled very much higher than in 1846.\n\n| ARTICLE       | YEAR |\n|---------------|------|\n|               | 1846 | 1876 | 1878 |\n| Millet        | ...  | 70   | 39   | 17   |\n| Rice          | ...  | 20   | 18   | 12   |\n| Pulse         | ...  | 60   | 40   | 12   |\n| Wheat         | ...  | 60   | 35   | 15   |\n| Gram          | ...  | 50   | 45   | 15   |\n| Cotton (cleaned) | ... | 8 to 10 | 6 | 4\u00bd |\n| Tobacco       | ...  | 40   | 21   | 16   |\n\n1 Gov. Res. 273, 13th Jan. 1880. Since 1802, the British Government have had a half share in the profits of the Cambay salt works. Before the days (1837) of a salt excise the revenue was thus divided. The produce of each pan was piled into two equal heaps, one the property of the makers, and the other, half the Naw\u00e1b's and half the British Government's. The makers took away their share, and the rest was sold by British and Cambay officers. When the Imperial salt duty was first levied, the Naw\u00e1b after some objection, agreed to introduce into his territory the rates prevailing in the neighbouring British districts.\nThe daily wages are, for skilled labour 1s. 6d. (12 as.) for masons, sawyers, carpenters, and bricklayers, and 1s. 3d. (10 as.) for plasterers; and for unskilled labourers 4\u00bdd. (3 as.). To equalize the burden of the state demand for unpaid labour, masons, sawyers, bricklayers, and plasterers, bring their wages every evening to the head of their caste, and the whole is equally divided. A carpenter, out of his day's earnings, pays \u00bdd. (4 pies), and from this sum 1s. 3d. (10 as.) a day are made over to each carpenter who is working for the Naw\u00e1b. The balance goes to repair rest-houses and pay for caste feasts. Each unskilled labourer receives 4\u00bdd. (2 as. 9 pies). The other \u00bdd. (6 pies) is paid by the employer to a state officer who collects the amount from all employers of labour, and from it pays 4\u00bdd. (3 as.) to every unskilled worker engaged by the Naw\u00e1b.\n\nCambay weights, the ser of one pound, the man of forty pounds, and the kh\u00e1ndi of 20 mans or 800 pounds avoirdupois, are the same as those in Kaira.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nCambay history is throughout little more than the record of the main events connected with its chief town. It divides itself into three parts. An early period lasting till (1304) the final Musalm\u00e1n conquest of Anhilv\u00e1da;\u00b9 a middle period, about four hundred and thirty years (1304-1730), when Cambay formed part of the Musalm\u00e1n kingdom and province of Gujar\u00e1t; and a modern period, from 1730, the record of Cambay as a distinct state.\n\nAccording to Dr. B\u00fchler the ancient Sanskrit name of Cambay is Stambhatirth, 'the pillar shrine'. The modern Gujar\u00e1ti Khambh\u00e1yat, or Khambh\u00e1t, is a corruption of Skambhatirth, stambh and skambh both meaning 'pillar'. According to the phonetic laws of the Pr\u00e1krit languages, initial sk is always changed to kh; rth becomes by assimilation tth,\u00b2 and medial t between vowels may be dropped. Thus the older Pr\u00e1krit form was Khambh\u00e1ittha, whence, through the loss\u00b3 of the final syllable and the change of i to ya, the Gujar\u00e1ti Khambh\u00e1yat, and, by a further contraction of the last two syllables, Khambh\u00e1t have been derived. What is meant by stambh, the first part of the name, is somewhat doubtful. The local legend that, in olden times, a copper pillar stood not far from the town gate, probably grew out of the following passage in the Kum\u00e1rika Khand.\u2074\n\nAfter Kum\u00e1r's victory over T\u00e1ra\u1e45k\u00e1sur, the grateful gods, admiring Guh with folded hands, spoke to him: 'We wish to tell thee something, listen. Of a truth it is reported since olden times, as a well known custom of conquerors, that those who overcome their foes, place on the field of battle a sign of their victory. Hence a most excellent pillar, stambha, to celebrate thy victory (over T\u00e1ra\u1e45k\u00e1sur), we wish to fix; thou shouldest permit us to do that, and the third excellent ling which Visvakarma wrought, do, thou, a son of Shiv, place in front of the pillar.'\n\n\u00b9 Anhilpar, Anhilv\u00e1da, or Nehrv\u00e1la the modern P\u00e1tan, north latitude 23\u00b0 48' east longitude 72\u00b0 2', on the south bank of the Sarasvati river, 65 miles north-east of Ahmedabad.\n\u00b2 Compare the Jain titthayar = t\u012brthankar. Dr. B\u00fchler.\n\u00b3 Compare Bharukuchchha = Bharuchchha = Bharuchh. Dr. B\u00fchler.\n\u2074 Kum\u00e1resh Mah\u00e1tmya, Adhy\u00e1ya XXX. This Kum\u00e1rika Khand, a very bulky legend, mah\u00e1tmya, professes to be part of the Skand-Pur\u00e1n, and to give the origin and history of the Kum\u00e1rika-Kshetra in general and of Stambha-tirth in particular. It has no historical value and has been written by persons who knew very little of Sanskrit. It may be from 400 to 500 years old. Dr. B\u00fchler.\nthe gods had thus spoken, highminded Skand gave his consent. Then the crowds of the gods, chief of whom is Sakra, placed on the field of battle an excellent, brilliant pillar of pure gold. Around it they raised an altar of earth, adorned with all precious substances. Joyfully the Apsar\u00e1s danced there. The mothers, full of gladness, sang songs of auspicious omen for Kum\u00e1r. Indra and others danced there, and Vishnu himself played (the drum). From the sky fell showers of flowers, and the drums of the gods resounded. When thus the pillar, called that of victory, which gladdened the world, had been erected, the son of three-eyed Shiv established the (ling of the) divine Stambheshvar in company with the rejoicing gods, Brahma, Hari, Har, and Indra, and with crowds of sages. To the west of that, highminded Guh, with the point of his spear, dug a well. There Ganga rises from the ground. The man, O son of P\u00e1ndu, who there performs funeral rites, pitritarpan, on the eighth day of the dark half of M\u00e1gh (February), and bathes in that well, will surely obtain the reward attending the performance of a funeral ceremony, shr\u00e1ddh, at Gaya. If he then worships the divine Stambheshvar with perfumes and flowers, he will obtain the reward of a V\u00e1jpeya sacrifice, and rejoice in Rudra\u2019s seat.\u2019\n\nDr. B\u00fchler adds, \u2018I am not inclined to attach much weight to the reason by which the legend explains the fact that Shiv was worshipped at Cambay as Stambheshvar or \u2018lord of the pillar\u2019. But it seems to me that the fact itself, which is also mentioned in other passages of the Kum\u00e1rika Khand (III. 40), furnishes a simple explanation of the name of the town. I believe that Stambh must be taken as one of the many names of Shiv, and that Stambhatirth means etymologically \u2018the shrine of pillar-shaped Shiv\u2019. Though I am not in a position to prove that Shiv received elsewhere the surname Stambh, there are two circumstances which afford countenance to my conjecture. First, the usual symbol of Shiv, the ling, is in the older temples, such as those of Valla, nothing but a simple hexagonal or round pillar, and might not inappropriately be called a stambh. Second, there is another very common name of Shiv, sth\u00e1nu, the etymological import of which is likewise \u2018a post or pillar\u2019. These two points, coupled with the fact that Shiv was, and is, worshipped in Cambay as \u2018lord of the pillar\u2019, incline me to translate the ancient name of the town as \u2018the shrine of pillar-shaped Shiv, or Shiv Stambheshvar\u2019. The other names of the town, Stambh\u00e1vati and Tramb\u00e1vati are, in my opinion, merely modern attempts to make a Sanskrit word out of the Pr\u00e1krit form.\u00b9 Neither name occurs in Jain or Br\u00e1hman writings of any antiquity. The Kum\u00e1rika Mahatmya professes also to fix the date of the foundation of the tirth. It informs us, in the third Adhy\u00e1ya, that the sage N\u00e1rad received from a king of Saur\u00e1shtra or Sorath, called\n\n\u00b9 These names are not real Sanskrit. The long a in Stambh\u00e1vati is inappropriate and is due to the desire of its inventor to preserve the long vowel which occurs in Khambh\u00e1t. Tramb\u00e1vati is a monster consisting of the Gujar\u00e1ti tr\u00e1mbun \u2018copper\u2019, to which the Sanskrit affix \u2018vat\u2019 has been added. It has probably been manufactured by a lapidum caput, that required a support for the copper walls or copper pillar attributed by some legends to the ancient town. Dr. B\u00fchler.\nDharmavarma, a considerable present in money and a piece of land at the mouth of the Mahi extending over seven *gavy\u016btis*, or, taking the *gavy\u016bti* at four thousand *hastas*, about twenty square miles. The Rishi earned this magnificent grant by the explanation of a verse, which king Dharmavarma had heard recited by a *Khav\u0101ni*, \u2018a voice which did not proceed from a body,\u2019 and which had baffled all native and foreign Pandits. In order to people his newly-acquired territory, N\u0101rad went to Katapagr\u0101m, a locality stated to be situated in Northern India near Ked\u0101rn\u0101th, and where a large colony of particularly learned and saintly Br\u0101hmans dwelt. He persuaded a number of them to emigrate to his *k\u1e63etra* on the Mahis\u0101gar, and miraculously carried them through the air on the top of his staff.\u00b9\n\nThe local story of Tramb\u0101vati\u00b2 connects the city with the Gardhabins or Gardhabas, a dynasty supposed to have ruled in Western India in the early centuries of the Christian era.\u00b3 According to this legend, Gadhesing, a son of the god Indra, and one of the Gandharvas or heavenly choristers, displeasing his father, was condemned, during the hours of day, to wear the form of an ass. Wandering in this shape, he visited the country between the Mahi and the S\u0101barmati, and, falling in love with the daughter of the chief, sought her in marriage. The chief agreed on one condition, that, in a single night, the suitor should fence the city with a wall of brass. By morning the wall was finished, and ever after the capital was known as Tramb\u0101vati, or the abode of brass. From the marriage of the Gandharva with the chief\u2019s daughter was born Vikram, the third king of that name, who ruled at Ujain in M\u0101lwa about the middle of the fifth century A.D.\u2074\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Kum. VI. 46. This is, no doubt, a reminiscence of the settlement of Br\u0101hmans at Cambay during the reign of Mulraj of Anhilvada (942-997) of which an account is given below, p. 214. The drawback to the story in the *Mah\u0101tmya* is that king Dharmavarma of Sorath is not mentioned elsewhere. During the last two thousand years, Sorath has rarely been under independent princes. It was first (315-178 B.C.) a dependency of the Maurya kingdom, ruled by a governor living at Girn\u0101r. Next it belonged to the Kshatrapas, or Sakas (about 150 A.D.), and, between the second and eighth centuries, first to the Guptas and then to the Valabhi kings. Only during the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries had Sorath kings of its own, who, according to the Jains, were Abhiras, and, according to their own account, Y\u0101davs. Next, in the twelfth century, the province passed to the Ch\u0101lukyas of Anhilv\u0101da, and, lastly, about the close of the thirteenth century, again to the Y\u0101davs. Dr. B\u00fchler.\n\n\u00b2 Under the Valabhi kings (319-658) mention is made of a city at the mouth of the Mahi called Gajni. This, a place of consequence and one of the chief ports of the kingdom, is said to have been destroyed at the time of the final sack of Valabhi, an event still undetermined, though it probably took place during the seventh century. R\u0101s M\u0101la, I. 21.\n\n\u00b3 Wilson\u2019s Ariana Antiqua, 410.\n\n\u2074 Wilford (As. Res. IX. 147-155; Prinsep\u2019s Ant. I. 342) was inclined to trace in this legend a reference to the visit (420-440) paid to India by Bahram V. of Persia called Gor or the wild-ass. This prince is supposed to have come to India to gain allies in his struggles with the Skythian tribe of Enthalites or White Huns, and is said to have connected himself by marriage with the house of the king of Kanauj, or, as related in another version, with a chief whose territories lay near the mouth of the Mahi. According to the latter account, Bahram Gor, when in India, founded a city near the capital of his father-in-law. This town was called *Gadhendrapuri*, and from its name and position, \u2018one day\u2019s march north of Broach,\u2019 the legend may perhaps have some connection with the ruined city of Gandh\u0101r on the south bank of the Mahi.\nAnother legend tells of the fall of Tramb\u00e1vati and the founding of Khamb\u00e1vati. R\u00e1ja Abhi Kum\u00e1r of Tramb\u00e1vati, warned by an idol that his town would be buried in a storm of dust and sand, taking the idol and its pedestal, left his town, and put to sea. The storm rose, and the town was overthrown, but by the pillar's help the king's ship came safe to land. Setting up the idol he began to build a city, and, after the pillar of the god, called it Khamb\u00e1vati.\n\nThe first historical references to Cambay are by the early Musalm\u00e1n writers. At the beginning of the tenth century, the Arab traveller M\u00e1sudi (913), describes Cambay as standing on a deep bay larger than that of the Nile, the Tigris, or the Euphrates, and with so strong central a tide that when it was low the sand was dry, and, even in the channel, only a little water was left. The shores of the gulf were covered with towns, villages, farms, tilled fields, trees and cocoanut gardens full of peacocks, paroquets, and other Indian birds. The city, famous for its sandals, was governed by a Br\u00e1hman, named Bania, who ruled in the name of the Balhara of Mankir, and was full of care for Musalm\u00e1n traders and other strangers.\n\nAbout the middle of the tenth century (942) the Ch\u00e1lukyas conquered Anhilv\u00e1da. They spread their power over Broach and the lands at the mouth of the Mah\u00ed, and the town of Cambay was one of their ports. Shortly before the close of his reign (997), Mulr\u00e1j, the founder of the dynasty, added to the importance of Cambay by settling there a Br\u00e1hman colony. One company of Br\u00e1hmans, brought by the king from Upper India, refused to stay in Gujar\u00e1t, longing to return to the sacred banks of the Ganges. On consulting the holy books, it was found that the spot where the Mah\u00ed entered the ocean was inferior in sanctity to no place upon earth. Here they agreed to settle, and the lands known as the Kum\u00e1rika Khetra, the field of Devi, stretching for eight miles round a temple sacred to that goddess, were assigned to them. On the site of this temple stands the old English factory. Not long after (1024), by the\n\n---\n\n1 Elliot's History, VI. 354. Colonel Tod (Western India, 247) relates the same legend under a slightly different form. A prince, finding the ancient city no longer fit for a residence, probably from the silting of the head of the gulf, determined to change its site. Raising a pillar (sthambh vulgo khamb) to the goddess, devi, on the sea-shore, he wrote on it a grant of the ancient town, with eighty-four villages, whose resources were to be applied to the maintenance of Devi's shrine.\n\n2 Prairies d'Or, I. 253-254. Reinaud's Memoir Sur l'Inde, 221. Al Istakhiri (951) and Ibn Haukal (1193) also mention Cambay. Elliot's History, I. 27, 39.\n\n3 Prairies d'Or, I. 253-254. M\u00e1sudi's Balhara of Mankir is now generally supposed to have been the R\u00e1thod ruler of M\u00e1lkhet in the Niz\u00e1m's dominions (north latitude 17\u00b0 east longitude 77\u00b0). His territory stretched along the west coast as far south as Chaul.\n\n4 Forbes' R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, I. 49.\n\n5 Forbes' R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, I. 65.\n\n6 Bom. Gov. Sel., New Series, XXVI. 76, note. This settlement of Br\u00e1hmans in 'the field of Devi' would seem to have been accompanied, by the transfer of the city from its former site, three miles inland, to its present site near the shore of the gulf. The legends of the transfer are, at least so far as the change of site goes, supported by later accounts. Two European writers in the seventeenth century (De la Valle, 1623, and Ogilby, 1670) notice, a league from Cambay, the ruins of an older town 'the ancient royal seat and chief city of Sorath.' This town De la Valle names Naghera (Letters, 108) and Ogilby, Agra (Atlas, V. 213). So, too, the author of the Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi (1748-1762) (Vol. III.), writes: They say that in ancient times there\ndestruction of Somn\u00e1th, Cambay became the chief Gujar\u00e1t port, and, with the growing greatness of Anhilv\u00e1da rapidly rose in wealth and prosperity. By the middle of the twelfth century it was a well known naval station, fertile, and with good trade, well supplied with water and protected by a fine fortress. About the same time mention is made of P\u00e1rsi and Musalm\u00e1n riots in Cambay. One of the Musalm\u00e1ns, whose faction was worsted, made his way to Anhilv\u00e1da, and, meeting the king, Sidhr\u00e1j Jaysing (1094-1143), hunting near his capital, complained to him that the P\u00e1rsis and Hindus had attacked the Musalm\u00e1ns, killed eighty of them, and destroyed their mosque and minaret. To satisfy himself of the truth of the charge, the king set off secretly on a camel, and, moving about Cambay under a disguise, heard enough to convince him that the Musalm\u00e1ns had been badly used. On his return to Anhilv\u00e1da he summoned two leading men from each class of the people of Cambay, Br\u00e1hmans, Fire-worshippers, and others (Jains), and ordered them to be punished. At the same time he made over to the Musalm\u00e1ns money enough to rebuild their mosque and towers. About the end of the twelfth century, Jaysing's mosques were destroyed when the B\u00e1la army invaded Anhilv\u00e1da. They were again rebuilt by a certain Syed Sharaf Tamin, who made four towers with golden cupolas.\n\nDuring the reign of Bhimdev II. in the year 1241, Vastup\u00e1l, the famous Jain minister of Bhim's steward Lavanpr\u00e1sad and of his son R\u00e1na Virdhaval, was for some time governor of Cambay. He founded the religious institutions of the Jains, the Posh\u00e1t\u00e1s, and libraries of Cambay. This is distinctly stated by his friend the Purohit Someshvar, in the Kirti Kaumudi (IV. 30 seqq.), and is confirmed by the fact that the oldest MSS. of the Jain Bhand\u00e1rs date from the first half of the thirteenth century. He also built Jain temples, probably those whose stones were afterwards (1308) used to build the J\u00e1ma Mosque.\n\nUnder the V\u00e1ghel\u00e1s, the last of the Anhilv\u00e1da dynasties, Cambay continued to increase in importance. At the close of the thirteenth century the Musalm\u00e1n invaders knew of it as the first city in Hind. Nor were they disappointed. The writers are full of the beauty of the neighbourhood and the wealth of the city. The air was pure, the water clear, and the country charming both in scenery and buildings.\n\nwas a great city where the village of Nagrah now is, three miles (1\u00bd kos) from Cambay. This city was called Tamb\u00e1nagri, and its walls were of copper, and in support of this it is said that once, digging for a well, the workers found a copper brick (Major J. W. Watson). With regard to the date of the transfer, it seems worthy of note, that while Ibn Haukal (943-968), who wrote before Sidhr\u00e1j's grant, places the town of Kambaya six miles (one parasang) inland (Elliot's History, I. 39), Edrisi (1153), who wrote after the grant, places it only three miles from the sea (Jaubert's Edrisi, 171). Nagrah is mentioned by Briggs (1838) as a hamlet five miles north-west of the city.\n\nCities of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1shtra, 166.\n\n1 Jaubert's Edrisi (1153), 172, and Elliot's History, I. 84.\n2 Muhammad Uh (1211-1236) in Elliot's History, II. 162-164, where B\u00e1la is supposed to mean M\u00e1lwa.\n3 Kirti Kaumudi.

A hundred years (1300 - 1400) of active trade, but of much insecurity and disorder; slightly more than a century and a quarter (1400 - 1530) of great wealth and importance; and two hundred years (1530 - 1730) of decline, growing disorder, and failing wealth.\n\nAbout 1304, only a few years after Marco Polo\u2019s (1290) visit, Cambay was captured by the troops of the Emperor Ala-ud-din Khilji (1295 - 1315). \u2018The city was plundered, the temples broken down,\\(^3\\) and the people slain without pity.\u2019\\(^4\\) A local governor was chosen and the city soon recovered. Ibn Batuta, who visited Gujar\u00e1t on his way to China (1345), found Cambay a very fine city, remarkable for the elegance and strength of its mosques and houses built by foreign merchants, the chief part of its population.\\(^5\\) In 1346, soon after Ibn Batuta\u2019s visit Gujar\u00e1t rose in rebellion against Muhammad Tughlak (1325 - 1351), and, in suppressing the revolt, Cambay was plundered by the Emperor\u2019s troops (1347). In a second rebellion (1349), the city was sacked by the insurgents and afterwards besieged by the Emperor.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Elliot\u2019s History, III. 43, 163.\n\\(^2\\) Yule\u2019s Marco Polo, II. 332. Polo\u2019s contemporary Marino Sanuto calls Cambay one of the two chief ports of India (Ditto). Muhammad Ufi\u2019s story (p. 215) of the Musalm\u00e1n and Siddhraj Jaysing shows that, about the beginning of the twelfth century, the Pars\u00eds were one of the most important classes in Cambay. Captain Robertson (1813), in his account of Cambay (Bom. Gov. Sel., New Series, XXVI.), supplies some details of the Cambay Pars\u00eds as well as of the improvements in the city introduced by one Kali\u00e1nr\u00e1i. Captain Robertson gives no dates, and nothing further has been found regarding the period to which his narrative refers. Some of the Pars\u00eds, who, since their arrival in India (636), had remained in the south of Gujar\u00e1t, were attracted to the settlement (942 - 997) in Kum\u00e1rika Kshetra at the month of the Mah\u00ed. The first comers succeeding in trade, others followed, and in time the Pars\u00ed element became so strong that by their overbearing conduct they forced the Hindus to leave the city. Among those who fled was Kali\u00e1nr\u00e1i a Dasa Lad V\u00e1n\u00ed. He took refuge in Surat * where, in a short time, by trading in pearls, he made a large fortune. Bringing a numerous band of Rajputs and Kol\u00eds, he, in the night, attacked the Pars\u00eds, put many to the sword, and set fire to their houses. The rest took to flight, and not a Pars\u00ed was to be seen in Kum\u00e1rika Kshetra. Kali\u00e1nr\u00e1i then formed the design of building a city on the ruins of the Pars\u00ed town. By restoring order, building reservoirs, improving the defences, and favouring trade, Kali\u00e1nr\u00e1i brought many wealthy men to settle at Cambay. So successful was his management that he received the voluntary homage of eighty-four villages, the Cambay Chord\u00e1si.\n\n* If this is Surat and not Sorath, Kali\u00e1nr\u00e1i\u2019s date can hardly have been before the fourteenth century.\n\n\\(^3\\) The chief Cambay mosque, the J\u00e1ma Mosque, built from the remains of Jain temples bears the date 1308.\n\\(^4\\) Elliot\u2019s History, III. 43. An account of the booty found in Cambay is given under the head \u201cTrade\u201d.\n\\(^5\\) About this time there was in Cambay a Musalm\u00e1n of considerable power and note, named Shaikh Ali Haid\u00e1ri, who made many predictions for merchants and seafaring men, and they in return made him many offerings. Lee\u2019s Ibn Batuta, 146, 164; Yule\u2019s Marco Polo, II. 333.\nAt the close of the fourteenth century (1391), on his being appointed to supersede R\u00e1sti Kh\u00e1n, Cambay sent a deputation to N\u00e1g\u00f3r in Jodhpur to wait on the new governor Zafar Kh\u00e1n and seek his favour and protection. On Zafar Kh\u00e1n\u2019s death (1411) a party of nobles, leaguing to oppose Ahmad I. (1411-1443), took Cambay. Failing to collect a force sufficient for the defence of the city they retired on Broach. Here they met with no better success, and, shortly after, by the submission of its leaders, the revolt came to an end. Ahmad\u2019s active care for the trade and naval strength of his kingdom greatly enriched Cambay. At the close of his reign it was a very noble city, twelve miles round.\n\nDuring the next eighty years of strong and successful rule, especially under Mahmud Begada (1459-1513), who, even more than Ahmad I., fostered its navy and trade, Cambay reached its greatest glory. In 1514 its houses were of stone and whitewash, handsome, and very lofty. The streets and squares were large and the country rich, fertile, and full of provisions. There were many craftsmen and mechanics, subtle workers after the fashion of Flanders: weavers of cotton, plain and dyed, fine and coarse; weavers of silk and velvet; makers of delicate articles in ivory; skilled embroiderers, silversmiths, and workers in coral and precious stones. Its people, well fed and well dressed, led easy lives, spending much of their time in pleasure and amusement. Drawn in oxen and horse carriages lined with rich silk and stamped kid skin mattresses, cushions, and pillows, with bands of musicians playing instruments and singing songs, festive parties were continually passing through the streets on their way to the rich gardens and orchards outside of the city walls.\n\nFrom the beginning of the sixteenth century the trade of Cambay suffered at the hands of the Portuguese. Many of its former marts on the coasts of Africa and Arabia were destroyed and much of the traffic with the south coast of India and the islands of the Eastern Archipelago was lost. Later on, with the defeat of its navy (1528-29), the plunder of its ports (1530-31), and the loss of Diu (1536), the chief profits of the great commerce of Gujar\u00e1t passed from local merchants to strangers. In 1535 the Emperor Hum\u00e1yun, in his pursuit of Bah\u00e1dur, arriving at Cambay too late by only a few hours, rested for some days. During his stay, his camp was robbed by a body of Kolis, and in revenge the city was pillaged. Three years later it was, with little resistance and the loss of only twenty-two wounded, taken by the Portuguese captain Don Jo\u00e3o da Castro. Most of the Moors were killed and the city was plundered and burnt. So great was the booty that the ships could not hold it. Cambay was then the richest city on the west coast. From supplying cloth to the whole of the east and great part of the west it was called by the Indians the garment of the world.\n\n---\n\n1 Nicolo de Conti (1420-1444) in Major\u2019s India in the XVth Century, II, 5, 20.\n2 Stanley\u2019s Barbosa, 60. Barbosa\u2019s travels probably lasted from about 1501 to 1517. He visited Cambay only a short time after the death of Mahmud Begada (1513), 57. Diu was then the port of Cambay and the chief emporium of trade.\n3 Prim. Rot. des Indes, 116, Vita de Jo\u00e3o Castro, 42-45, and Dic. Hist. Expl. (1848), 20.\nIn the general disorder of the next forty years Cambay was, from time to time, handed from one to the other of the almost independent nobles. In the partition of Gujar\u00e1t, during the minority of Ahmad II. (1554-1561), Cambay, with P\u00e1tan, Chor\u00e1si, Dholka, Gogha, and Dhandhuka, were assigned to Syed Mub\u00e1rak. Shortly after (1560), on his defeat and death, the Syed\u2019s estates were seized by the regent Itim\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n. Again, in 1571, in consequence of his victory over Itim\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, Cambay fell into the hands of Changez Kh\u00e1n, son of Im\u00e1d-ul-Mulk Rumi, and was by him granted to his mother. This gift was the cause of Changez Kh\u00e1n\u2019s death. Bijli Kh\u00e1n, an Abyssinian commander, claiming a previous promise of Cambay, slew Changez Kh\u00e1n (1572), and Cambay again became part of Itim\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n\u2019s possessions.\n\nIn 1573, Cambay, then yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a340,000 (Rs. 4,00,000), passed under the Emperor Akbar. Visiting the city, and amusing himself by sailing on the gulf, Akbar brought weavers and other skilled workmen, and founded two suburbs, calling one after himself and the other Sikandar or Shakkarpura. Though, by lowering trade and transit dues, Akbar increased the prosperity of the province, Cambay was, from time to time, unsettled by the movements of insurgent bands, and was thrice attacked and pillaged. In 1573, Akbar\u2019s cousin and rival, Mirza Muhammad Husain, advancing suddenly from Kh\u00e1ndesh, surprised Broach and Cambay. Ten years later (1583), during the rebellion of Muzafar, the last of the Ahmedabad kings, Said-ud-daulat, the servant of one Kali\u00e1nrai of Cambay, collected troops, seized Cambay, and held the city for some time (1583-84). Again in 1606, Muzafar\u2019s son Bah\u00e1dur, \u2018proclaiming liberty and laws of good fellowship,\u2019 sacked and held Cambay for fourteen days.\n\nIn 1583 the English made their first attempt to open a trade with India. Three merchants, Fitch, Leedes, and Newberry, with letters from Queen Elizabeth to Akbar \u2018King of Cambay\u2019, started for Gujar\u00e1t by way of the Persian Gulf. Reaching Ormuz in safety their efforts to trade were at first successful. But they were soon seized by the Portuguese, imprisoned, and carried to Goa. Escaping from Goa, Fitch traded in India for some time, but none of them carried out the original scheme of visiting Cambay.\n\nAbout the same time (1585) the Venetian traveller C\u00e6sar Frederic found Cambay a fair city, of such trade as he could not have believed possible if he had not seen it. During one of his\n\n---\n\n1 Bird\u2019s Mir\u00e2t-i-Ahmadi, II. 312.

(New Series), XXVI. 55.\n3 This was one of the Mirz\u00e1s whose revolt from 1571 to 1573 caused Akbar so much trouble.\n4 Bird\u2019s Mir\u00e2t-i-Ahmadi, 366.\n5 Finch (1608-1612) in Kerr\u2019s Voyages, VIII. 275, 302.\n6 Fitch in Hakluyt\u2019s Voyages, II. 375-402. Thanks chiefly to the fame of Mahmud Begada, European writers in the sixteenth century used Cambay in the sense of India.\n7 C\u00e6sar Frederic was in Cambay twelve years after Akbar\u2019s conquest, that is, in 1585. Hakluyt\u2019s Voyages, II. 344. No other notice of the famine to which he refers has been traced, unless it was in 1590, when, at the siege of Jun\u00e1gad, the Gujar\u00e1t troops were much distressed for want of grain.\nvisits, the city was in so great calamity and scarceness that the Gentile people brought their sons and daughters, and asked the Portuguese to buy them, offering them for ten to thirteen shillings a piece.\\(^1\\)\n\nExcept the first few years, Cambay was, during the whole of the seventeenth century, free from pillage or disturbance. Its manufactures maintained much of their importance, but the honour of being the chief Musalm\u00e1n port of Gujar\u00e1t was gradually passing to its younger rival Surat. The old trade route through Cambay and Ahmedabad north by mount \u00c1bu was, for the time, closed by the disturbed state of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Rajput\u00e1na; Deccan wars kept the Imperial head-quarters in the south of Hindust\u00e1n, in Kh\u00e1ndesh, and in the Deccan; and the increase in their size, and the growing shoalness of the head of the gulf, made the mouth of the T\u00e1pti a safer anchorage for European ships. In 1608 Cambay had still a topping trade for all sorts of cloth and rich drugs. Often near the city were as many as two hundred small Portuguese grabs and frigates.\\(^2\\) The Dutch established themselves in 1617, and in 1623 had a large and thriving factory.\\(^3\\) The English, in 1613, gained leave to start a factory, and in 1616 were strong enough to have the Portuguese dismissed from the town.\\(^4\\)\n\nShortly after the beginning of the seventeenth century (1611), the English traveller Finch describes Cambay as compassed by a strong brick\\(^5\\) wall, with high and handsome houses forming straight paved streets, each with a gate at either end. De la Valle, who was in Cambay in 1623, though he says little of the trade of the city or of the wealth of its people, gives the impression of considerable prosperity. The suburbs, stretching far beyond the town, were adorned by reservoirs, especially by one beautifully built with a flight of marble steps. There was a hospital with rooms, where men and women suffering from incurable diseases were lodged,\\(^6\\) and wards for aged and infirm animals. Ogilby's account, about fifty years later (1670), is interesting, though in some details incorrect. The city, twice as big as Surat, was surrounded by a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Haklayt's Voyages, II. 344.\n\n\\(^2\\) Finch (1608-1612) in Kerr's Voyages, VIII. 308.\n\n\\(^3\\) De la Valle's Letters, 64-68. According to some accounts the Dutch had a factory at Cambay as early as 1604, but Stavorinus (III. 107) gives 1617. They would seem to have closed their factory before 1670.\n\n\\(^4\\) Sir T. Roe in Kerr's Voyages, IX. 315.\n\n\\(^5\\) This is probably correct, as Forbes (Oriental Memoirs, II. 18, 19) speaks of it as a brick wall. Mandelslo (1638) talks of a handsome wall of cut stone (Travels, 101-109), Ogilby (1670, Atlas, V. 213) of a double stone wall, and Baldaeus (about 1680, Churchill, III. 506) of a triple wall. Thevenot (about 1666, Voyages, V. 36), a more careful observer, gives some further details. The town walls were beautifully built of brick about four yards high and with towers at intervals. The Governor had a castle, large but not beautiful. The houses were built of sunburnt bricks. Outside of the town were many fine public gardens and a marble tomb built by a king of Gujar\u00e1t to the memory of a governor of Cambay. Mandelslo (1638) and Baldaeus (1680) both speak of Cambay as twice the size of Surat.\n\n\\(^6\\) De la Valle's Letters, 68. This part of the instructions contained in the second of Asoka's edicts is not at present carried out in any of the animal hospitals in Gujar\u00e1t.\ndouble stone wall with twelve gates. In the middle were three great market places and fifteen pleasant orchards with four pools supplying water all the year round. The streets were straight and broad and locked every night by a great pair of gates. The houses, partly brick partly freestone, were very moist and very cool. In England they would be accounted mean, yet they were the best in the country, covered with tiles, and having gutters for the rain water. Outside of the walls were great suburbs the chief ornament of the city. Though many ships came from all places, the haven was of no consequence, only a bare road. Ships of burden were forced to lie a good distance from the shore. Small vessels could anchor at high water close before the city, but at low water they lay dry. The tides at Cambay were exceeding swift. The flood rushed so furiously that no horse could outrun it, and rose to its full height in a quarter of an hour.\\(^1\\) About the same time, Tavernier (1642-1666) states that a bank of silt, about a mile and-a-half broad, had formed between the town walls and the water, and that great ships could come no nearer than from nine to twelve miles.\\(^2\\) Towards the close of the century (1695) the Italian traveller Gemelli Careri, though he says it had lost much of its splendour and magnificence, found Cambay a large and rich city.\\(^3\\)\n\nEarly in the eighteenth century Cambay had further declined. It was (1720) still a place of good trade, contributing much to the wealth and grandeur of Surat, the chief centre of commerce. But it 'was harassed by the P\u00e1taners, mostly horsemen and bold fellows who borrowed round sums from the city by way of compulsion.'\\(^4\\) The Rajputs and Kolis plundered even to the gates, and sometimes surprised the city itself, for which neglect the governors' heads answered. In 1716 they were very bold and presumptuous, so that a stop was put to the trade of Ahmedabad and Cambay. The Governor of Surat\\(^5\\) raised an army of 20,000 men to chastise and restrain them. But they laid so many ambuscades that in two months the army was reduced to less than half, and the rest were obliged to get home with sorrowful hearts to Surat.\\(^6\\)\n\nThe English were the only Europeans who kept a factory at Cambay after the close of the seventeenth century.\\(^7\\) The history of the English at Cambay, in the beginning of the eighteenth century,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Atlas, V. 213.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tavernier in Harris, II. 353.\n\n\\(^3\\) Gemelli Careri in Churchill, IV. 188. According to this traveller the cause of Cambay's decline was two-fold, the disorders that had overtaken the city since the Portuguese ceased to govern it, and the silting of the gulf. Gemelli is mistaken about the Portuguese. They never held Cambay.\n\n\\(^4\\) These are probably the K\u00e1th\u00eds, called P\u00e1taners, from the city of Dev or Mungi P\u00e1tan (north latitude 20\u00b0 55' east longitude 70\u00b0 21') on the south-west coast of the peninsula. P\u00e1tan, on the south point of Ver\u00e1val harbour, had within its walls the famous temple of Somn\u00e1th.\n\n\\(^5\\) This was Haidar Kuli Kh\u00e1n who afterwards was (1721-1722) 51st Viceroy. In 1716 when appointed both to Cambay and Surat, he chose Surat for himself, and sent a deputy to Cambay.\n\n\\(^6\\) Hamilton's New Account of Hindust\u00e1n, I.145.\n\n\\(^7\\) It seems doubtful whether the English had a factory between 1660 and 1700. See Macpherson's Commerce, 163.\nruns in most respects parallel with the history of their larger establishment at Surat. At both places there were the same annoyances and obstructions. Both were subject to the oppression of Moghal governors, and were harassed on land by lawless Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and at sea by no less lawless Kolis and Rajputs. In 1720 Mr. Wyard, the Resident, suffered much from the extortions of the Muhammadan governor, and in 1725 the whole city was threatened with destruction by two rival Mar\u00e1tha armies, under Pil\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r and Kant\u00e1ji Kadam. At Pil\u00e1ji's approach the country people flocked in alarm to Cambay. Following them, he demanded \u00a350,000 (Rs. 5,00,000), and when payment was refused he set fire to the suburbs. Soon after Kant\u00e1ji came, claiming sole power to levy contributions, and offering Pil\u00e1ji \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) if he would leave. Refusing to leave, Pil\u00e1ji was attacked and defeated. Then Kant\u00e1ji demanded a contribution of \u00a311,000 (Rs. 1,10,000), of which the English share was to be \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000). Mr. Daniel Innes, the Resident, remonstrated, pleading the privileges of trade and the exemption from all payments conceded to the English by Sh\u00e1hu R\u00e1ja. At this 'the armed villains laughed'. But, after receiving the first instalment of \u00a350 (Rs. 500), they were forced to leave and nothing more was paid. The followers of Hamid Kh\u00e1n, the Musalm\u00e1n governor of Ahmedabad, next appeared before Cambay, levying \u00a33500 (Rs. 35,000) on the town, and demanding \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) from the Resident. 'The first time they went back with a put-off,' writes Mr. Innes, 'and the next with a flat denial, and I have not heard from them since, further than that the governor and the geenim fellow here has advised them to desist. They are but two hundred men, and I am under no manner of apprehension'. The governor then locked and sealed the English warehouses. This measure Mr. Innes counteracted by menaces and two cases of spirits, 'more effectual than money in subduing Musalm\u00e1n greed'. The seals were removed, and the eccentric Resident, a month later, replies to the congratulations of his superiors with this counter-hint, 'I shall have regard to your hint of the governor being dry; though I have quenched his thirst at my own charge too often for my pocket.' After Ahmad Kh\u00e1n's followers left, a new deputy was appointed on promise of sending \u00a39000 (Rs. 90,000) to Ahmedabad. This sum had to be wrung from the people of Cambay, and no sooner did the unhappy merchants and shopkeepers hear of his approach than they hid themselves, or made their escape to the neighbouring villages. For six days not a man was seen in Cambay, though the governor threatened, unless the people came back, to give over the city to pillage.\n\nThe power of the Moghal Viceroys declined so gradually that it is difficult to say in what year Cambay was established as a distinct state. Its independence seems to date from about 1730, when Mirza J\u00e1fir Najam-ud-danl\u00e1h was appointed paymaster to the troops, reporter on Gujar\u00e1t, and governor of Cambay. This Mirza J\u00e1fir was\n\n---\n\n1 Geenim, for ghanim robber, used of the Mar\u00e1tha agent.\n2 Surat Diaries, 1720-1726, in Bom. Quar. Rev.

Coming to Gujar\u00e1t a poor man, the Viceroy Mub\u00e1riz-ul-Mulk (1723-1730), in 1725, with the title of Najam-ud-daul\u00e1h, placed him in command of Petl\u00e1d, about sixteen miles north of Cambay. Soon after he received in marriage the daughter of Momin Kh\u00e1n Dehlami, minister of Gujar\u00e1t and agent for Cambay and Surat.\u00b9\n\nIn 1730, Chinn\u00e1ji \u00c1ppa, the brother of Peshwa B\u00e1jir\u00e1o I., demanded from Cambay a contribution of \u00a330,000 (Rs. 3,00,000), exacted nearly \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000) from Petl\u00e1d, and ruthlessly plundered Dholka. The trade and city of Cambay were threatened with ruin. What the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s left the Musalm\u00e1ns tried to extract. Another Mar\u00e1tha visit was (1733) followed by a second Musalm\u00e1n levy so oppressive that bankers and merchants closed their shops and left the city. Two years later (1735) the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s demanded half of the customs revenue, threatening, in case of refusal, to lay waste the city with fire and sword.\u00b2\n\nFor two years after his father-in-law\u2019s death (1730), Mirza J\u00e1fr Najam-ud-daulah remained in charge of Petl\u00e1d. In 1730, in consequence of some misunderstanding with the Viceroy, he retired to Delhi. Well received at court he returned in the same year (1730) to Gujar\u00e1t with the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Abhayising, the new Viceroy. Mirza J\u00e1fr did the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja good service, inducing Mub\u00e1riz-ul-Mulk the late Viceroy to retire from Gujar\u00e1t without a struggle. In reward, he was made paymaster of the troops, reporter on Gujar\u00e1t and governor of Cambay, and the management of the lands near Cambay was entrusted to his cousin Fida-ud-din Kh\u00e1n. For a time Mirza J\u00e1fr held Petl\u00e1d in farm. But disputing with the Viceroy, he was forced to give it up. In 1733, in consequence of Mula Muhammad Ali\u2019s disturbances,\u00b3 Mirza J\u00e1fr was ordered to take charge of Surat. But his agent failing to take it, the city remained in the hands of Tegbakht Kh\u00e1n. At Cambay Mirza J\u00e1fr was nearly independent. In\n\n\u00b9 This Momin Kh\u00e1n Dehlami, a descendant of the Dehlamite kings of Persia (932) is said, like his son-in-law Mirza J\u00e1fr, to have owed his advance to the patronage of Mub\u00e1riz-ul-Mulk Sarbuland Kh\u00e1n. Through the influence of that nobleman, he was, in 1714, appointed from Delhi to be agent for Surat and Cambay, and at the same time was put in charge of the districts of Baroda, Broach, Dholka, Petl\u00e1d and Nadi\u00e1d. Placing deputies in the other districts, Momin Kh\u00e1n Dehlami reserved for himself the charge of Surat. In the following year (1715), in consequence of the changes that accompanied the appointment of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Ajitsing (48th Viceroy, 1715-1716), Momin Kh\u00e1n lost his command. Regaining it in 1719, for the three following years he was in a position of so much power that, in the disorders caused by the Mar\u00e1tha inroads, he is said to have aimed at independence. On the removal of Ajitsing (1721), Momin Kh\u00e1n again lost his command. But, in 1722, Asaph Jah Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk (52nd Viceroy, 1722) for a third time chose him governor of Surat. In the following year (1723) Momin Kh\u00e1n attempted, but without success, to resist Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r in an attack on Surat. In spite of this reverse he was soon after, by the appointment of Mub\u00e1riz-ul-Mulk (53rd Viceroy, 1728-1730), chosen minister, div\u00e1n. About 1725 Momin Kh\u00e1n gave Mirza J\u00e1fr his daughter in marriage. For two years more Momin Kh\u00e1n Dehlami continued to act as minister, and apparently as agent at Cambay and Surat. He died in 1728 (Robertson, 58, gives 1726), and was buried in Cambay, where, in 1812, his tombstone was still to be seen.\n\n\u00b2 Letters from the Resident at Cambay, 1730-1735.\n\n\u00b3 Details are given in the Surat Statistical Account. Bombay Gazetteer, II: 110,111.\n1732, when the Viceroy left, he treated Ratansing the deputy Viceroy with little respect, and in 1734, when ordered to relieve Baroda, he withdrew, and left the city to fall into the Gaikwar's hands (1734). In the following year (1735) the Viceroy suspected Mirza Jafir of secretly helping Sohrab Khan to gain Viramgam; and, so strong was the ill-feeling between them, that Mirza Jafir, afraid of assassination, withdrew to Cambay. Soon after (1636), engaging a Maratha force near Cambay, he was defeated and compelled to retire within the walls, where he remained in spite of Ratansing's orders to help him against the Marathas. Ratansing, in return, made over Petlad, Arhar-Matar, and Nadiad to Sher Khan, one of the Babi family. Mirza Jafir was making ready to resist this transfer, when, with the title of Najam-ud-daulah Momin Khan Bahadur Firoz Jang, he was (1737) appointed Viceroy. Opposed by Ratansing and the Jaloris, Momin Khan was forced to seek the help of the Marathas. Summoning Rangoji, he promised that, if they were successful, he would make over to the Marathas one-half of the Gujarati revenue, except the receipts from Ahmedabad and Cambay. Very shortly after (1737) Abhayasing was again chosen Viceroy. At the same time Momin Khan was told that the appointment of Abhayasing was nominal, and that the Emperor wished Momin Khan to persevere in expelling Abhayasing and his adherents. Momin Khan, accordingly, appointing his son-in-law Najam Khan, governor of Cambay, advanced against Ahmedabad, and, with the aid of his Maratha allies, after a siege of nine months, captured the city. During most of the five following years Momin Khan's head-quarters were in Ahmedabad. But in 1741, he visited Cambay, and took what steps he could to prevent its decline. In 1743 Momin Khan died.\n\nAs a temporary measure, he was succeeded in the government of Gujarati by Fida-ud-din Khan his reputed brother, and Muftakhir Khan his son. In the following year (1743-44) Muftakhir was formally appointed Viceroy. Failing to hold his own against Jawan Mard Khan and other members of the Babi family, he was forced to retire to Cambay. Here, along with Fida-ud-din Khan, Najam Khan, and Rangoji, plans were discussed for an attack on Ahmedabad. In return for his alliance, Rangoji, on the Gaikwar's behalf, demanded one-half of the Cambay revenues in addition to those of the rest of Gujarati granted by Momin Khan in 1737. Muftakhir Khan and his party at first refused; but Rangoji, bringing an army close to the city, made them agree, and advance him a further sum of \u00a38000 (Rs. 80,000). These schemes against the Babi coming to nothing,\n\n---\n\n1 This Najam Khan was Zimal Abedin Najam Khan, a descendant of the Najam-i-Sani family. He governed Cambay for about eleven years, and in 1748 was poisoned by his brother-in-law Muftakhir Khan (Momin Khan II.)\n\n2 Maratha help was dearly bought. Rangoji in the first instance promised to aid Momin Khan on condition of receiving one-half of the revenues of Gujarati, except the cities of Ahmedabad and Cambay. Afterwards, Ratansing made more tempting offers, and, to bind Rangoji to his cause, Momin Khan was forced, in addition to his original concessions, to make over to the Marathas the whole district of Viramgam.\n\n3 According to the account given in the Surat Diaries, Rangoji sat down before Cambay with twenty thousand men, and from this time, although obliged to take less, the Marathas claimed half the revenue of the city. On the occasion of the Maratha\nMuft\u00e1khir Kh\u00e1n for five years remained in Cambay. From time to time he tried to enforce his right to be Viceroy, but his attempts failing, he instead determined to gain possession of Cambay. With this object he procured the death of his brother-in-law Najam Kh\u00e1n, who, since 1737, had managed the city.\n\nIn these troubles the English factory suffered many exactions. In 1737, Momin Kh\u00e1n, pressed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s for the price of their alliance, extracted from Cambay a sum of \u00a315,000 (Rs. 1,50,000). Attempting on one occasion to wring a contribution from Mr. Hodges, the English Resident, he was at first bought off by the present of a fowling piece. He then wanted to buy silk, iron, and sugar to the value of \u00a33000 or \u00a34000 (Rs. 30,000 - 40,000). This too the Resident managed to evade. But he was not always so successful, and had from time to time to pay large sums. In 1735, the Company suffered from a contest between Daniel Innes and Hugh Bidwell, who had been appointed to succeed Innes as Resident. Raising a mob, Innes tried to force Bidwell from the factory. Failing in this, he induced the Naw\u00e1b to bring charges of incompetency against him, and, in consequence, Bidwell was removed and Munro sent in his place. The change did not benefit Innes, who was forced to retire to Surat. In 1741 the Naw\u00e1b forbade the exportation of indigo, and seized some property belonging to Lambton, the chief of Surat, who had disregarded his order. This act was declared an infringement of the English Company\u2019s privileges, and some grabs were ordered to seize Cambay boats. On this the Naw\u00e1b speedily came to terms. The same process of capturing boats was, in 1743, with similar results, adopted by Sewel the next Resident.\n\nThough trade was gradually deserting Cambay, the eleven years (1737-1748) of Najam Kh\u00e1n\u2019s management seem to have been fairly prosperous. The Viceroy was interested in Cambay; and, as noticed above, in 1741 paid it a special visit with the object of inquiring into the causes of its decay. During the years (1743-1748) that followed Momin Kh\u00e1n\u2019s death, though the Cambay revenues were from time to time burdened by Mar\u00e1tha demands, the city was never attacked, nor its neighbourhood laid waste. The suburbs founded by Akbar were still inhabited, and the other nine quarters beyond the walls continued to support skilful and well-to-do craftsmen. At the same time the revenues had fallen off, and, in spite of the levy of fresh taxes, the total receipts were not more than\n\nadvance, the Naw\u00e1b insisted that some of the bastions should be defended by the English Resident. He succeeded in mustering a native officer and five peons, but the courage of the little party was not tried. The invaders, unprepared to batter stone walls, satisfied their revenge by cutting off the ears and noses of all Musalm\u00e1ns on whom they could lay hands.

Every cart-load was charged 6d. (4 as.) For some time the cultivators succeeded in avoiding the weight of this cess by increasing the cart-load from 1280 lbs. (32 mans) to 2400 pounds (32-60 mans). When Najam Kh\u00e1n found this out, he changed the tax to one of 3 pice on every 5 mans. Robertson, 65.\n\u00a340,000 (Rs. 4,00,000). At the close of 1750 (December) the Jesuit Father Tieffenthaler found Cambay governed partly by a Mar\u00e1tha D\u00e1maji, partly by a Moghal. The Moghal paid the Emperor no tribute because he could keep from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and the savage Kolis hardly enough for himself and his garrison. The city, though much fallen from its former state, was very large, girt with bastioned walls more than a German mile round. Its streets were narrow and dirty, its market place small and mean, and many of its high but dingy brick and cement houses were ruined, and others threatening to fall. The only objects of interest were two mosques, one of cut stone very beautiful; the Governor's house; and the English factory. To the north joined to the city walls was a fortified suburb about 500 yards round with a broad gate. This was ruined and almost without an inhabitant. Most of the people were Hindus; the rest, except 200 P\u00e1rsis, were Musalm\u00e1ns. The English brought various wares from Bombay and sent away cotton goods. These goods, woven in considerable quantities in the villages round, were of a special make much in demand in other countries, even in Europe. The only other industry was the manufacture of salt. Only small one-masted craft could come to Cambay, and even they, except in the rains and at very high springs when they could reach the walls, had to stop half a mile from the city. Seven years earlier the tide dashed in with such speed that a horseman at full gallop could hardly outrun it. Now (1750) the tide set against the east shore of the gulf, but at Cambay came so slowly and quietly as to give no great shock to vessels at anchor.\n\nOn hearing of Najam Kh\u00e1n\u2019s death, the Delhi Government confirmed Muft\u00e1khir Kh\u00e1n in the chiefship of Cambay, dignifying him with the title of Nur-ud-din Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Momin Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, and with the rank of a noble of 6000. Fida-ud-din Kh\u00e1n, when he heard of the death of Najam Kh\u00e1n, on pretence of condoling with the family marched to Cambay, but he was refused admittance and forced to retire. Succeeding without opposition, one of Momin Kh\u00e1n II.\u2019s first acts was to poison his half sister Nur Jah\u00e1n or Kh\u00e1num Begam the widow of the late governor. In 1752, when news reached Gujar\u00e1t of the division of the province between the Peshwa and the Gaikw\u00e1r, Momin Kh\u00e1n, who was always quarrelling with the Gaikw\u00e1r\u2019s agent, begged the Peshwa to include Cambay in his share. The Peshwa agreed, and, in the course of the year (1752), Momin Kh\u00e1n paid P\u00e1ndurang Pandit the Peshwa\u2019s deputy \u00a3700 (Rs. 7000), together with a present of four small cannon. In the following year (1753, April) Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v, the Peshwa\u2019s brother, advancing within ten miles of Cambay, forced Momin Kh\u00e1n to raise his yearly payment to \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000).\n\n---\n\n1 Res. Hist. et Geog. de l\u2019Inde, I. 381-383. In Tieffenthaler\u2019s opinion this change was due to the rising of the banks at the head of the gulf, to the filling of the bed, and the removal of a groin of sand that used to stop the mouth and pile up the tidal waters till they forced their way in and rushed as along a ditch. In his sketch (458) the whole top of the gulf is entered as covered at the flood and dry at the ebb.\n\n2 Robertson, 65.\nEven this was not enough to protect Cambay from Mar\u00e1tha demands. During the rainy season many parts of the Cambay wall fell down. Hearing this Shripatrav, before the rains were over, made ready a detachment of troops and sent forward a messenger to examine the state of Cambay. That Momin Kh\u00e1n might not suspect his object, Shripatrav had a valuable carriage built. Fitting it with gold and silver hangings, he gave out that it was meant as a present for Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v, the Peshwa's brother, and, to escort it through Gujar\u00e1t he left Ahmedabad with a body of horse and a party of five hundred M\u00e1valis. After a few days march, at Petl\u00e4d, about sixteen miles north-east of Cambay, Shripatrav halted and prepared to attack the city. Here Vrij\u00e1l, Momin Kh\u00e1n's steward, on his way from Bombay, hearing that Shripatrav was at Petl\u00e4d, went to pay his respects. Suspecting Shripatrav's designs, Vrij\u00e1l sent his master an express to be on his guard against surprise. Momin Kh\u00e1n made every effort to repair the walls. Nor were his preparations thrown away. On the first favourable evening Shripatrav moved from Petl\u00e4d. He counted on being at Cambay by midnight. But the guide lost his way, and he did not reach the city till shortly before daybreak. On nearing the town, the besiegers met with a second disappointment. Where they expected a breach, they found a new and strong fortification. One part of the wall seemed undefended, and this the M\u00e1valis scaled. But again fortune declared for the garrison: troops unseen by the besiegers were at hand and drove back the assailants. By this time Momin Kh\u00e1n was on the spot with reinforcements, and a third attempt was repulsed with heavy loss. Next day the fighting was renewed, but again ended in favour of the besieged. After a week of fruitless effort Shripatrav changed his tactics. Letting loose his men, he plundered and laid waste the Cambay villages. This device succeeded, and Momin Kh\u00e1n, anxious at any cost to be rid of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, agreed to pay \u00a3700 (Rs. 7000). The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s withdrew, but such had been their violence and greed that the eleven suburbs were almost entirely deserted. Momin Kh\u00e1n was brought to the greatest straits. For the next year the district round Cambay yielded him almost nothing. All but \u00a36000 (Rs. 60,000) had been carried off by Shripatrav, and, of what was left, the whole was given to the Peshwa, half as his ordinary share, and the rest as a special present on condition that no Mar\u00e1tha should in future collect the revenue at Cambay. At the same time Momin Kh\u00e1n seeing that he could not trust the friendship of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, determined to increase the strength of his army. With this object he was forced to resort to many acts of extortion. And though, for the time, his measures brought him in large sums of money, they did his state a lasting injury, forcing from it many wealthy and peaceable subjects.\n\nSoon after this, the Peshwa made a second attempt on Cambay. Bhagvantrav, his agent, sent without troops, was well received. But Momin Kh\u00e1n knew why Bhagvantrav had come, and, on getting hold of a letter from Bhagvantrav to S\u00e1lim Jamad\u00e1r at Ahmedabad\n\n---\n\n1 These M\u00e1valis, the people of the west Deccan, m\u00e1val west, Shiv\u00e1ji's favourite troops were probably the most daring of the Mar\u00e1tha tribes, Grant Duff, (Bom. Ed.), 67.\ninviting him to attack Cambay, he surrounded Bhagvantrav's house and made him prisoner. An attempt of the Maratha garrisons of the neighbouring towns of Jambusar, Virangam, and Dhandhuka to force the surrender of Bhagvantrav failed; and it was finally agreed that Bhagvantrav should be released, and that the relations between Momin Khan and the Peshwa should remain unchanged. In the following year (1754) Bhagvantrav made another attempt on Cambay. After several doubtful engagements peace was concluded on condition that Momin Khan should pay \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). The chief events of the next two years (1755-1757) of Momin Khan's rule, the most successful period of his life, belong to the general history of Gujar\u00e1t. He collected tribute from K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r, captured Gogha, recovered Ahmedabad from the Marath\u00e1s, defended Ahmedabad, and was finally forced to restore it to the Marath\u00e1s in April 1757. The conditions of surrender were, on the whole, favourable. He kept Cambay, and was paid by the Peshwa a sum of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). On the other hand, he was forced to pay the Marath\u00e1s a yearly tribute of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) and to give up all claims on the town of Gogha. On his return from Ahmedabad, Momin Khan was at first harassed by his troops for arrears of pay. But on the timely arrival of his steward Vrijl\u00e1l, with the Peshwa's contribution of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000), the demands of the army were satisfied.\n\nShortly after this (1757), Momin Khan is said to have instigated the murder of his steward Vrijl\u00e1l. He attempted to evade the Peshwa's tribute, and in hopes that his failure might be overlooked, he made arrangements for paying a visit to Poona. But Sadashiv R\u00e1mchandra, the Peshwa's deputy, refused to allow him to leave until he had made good his arrears. Advancing against the city he continued to besiege it till Momin Khan handed him a sum of \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000). Shortly after, Momin Khan set out for Surat, and was there received by Mr. Spencer, the chief of the English factory. From Surat he sailed for Bombay, where the Governor, Mr. Bourchier, treated him with much courtesy. After a short stay, he went on to Poona, reaching the end of his journey in 1759. At Poona he was received with attention. The Peshwa's cousin, Sad\u00e1shivr\u00e1v, met him at the gate of the fort and conducted him to B\u00e1l\u00e1jir\u00e1v, who, embracing his visitor, seated him in the place of honour next his own, and, after a few days, paid him the compliment of a return visit. Momin Khan, from his long intercourse with the Marath\u00e1s, knew well how to please them, and distributing presents with a free hand, gained great respect. After a two months stay he returned to Bombay, receiving from the Peshwa the present of an elephant and other valuable gifts. Whatever were Momin Khan's views in undertaking this journey, it in no way changed his relations with the Peshwa. A fresh treaty was drawn up with conditions the same as those previously in force. During his stay in Bombay, Momin Khan wrote the Court of Directors a friendly and respectful letter. The Court sent a very gracious reply, and their letter was preserved as a record to be spoken of to every English Resident, or to any Native power with whom Momin Khan...\nhad dealings. From Bombay Momin Kh\u00e1n travelled overland to Surat, reaching Cambay before the close of 1759. After his return, Momin Kh\u00e1n was at pains to gain as a friend Ganesh \u00c1p\u00e1ji, the Peshwa\u2019s representative, and so successful were his advances that it was arranged that the Peshwa\u2019s agent should be withdrawn from Cambay, and that all Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 claims should be satisfied by the yearly payment of \u00a38400 (Rs. 84,000).\n\nIn 1761, the Delhi Court, taking advantage of the confusion that fell on the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s after their defeat at P\u00e1nipat (1761, January 7th), directed the chief Musalm\u00e1n nobles to join together in driving them out of Gujar\u00e1t. Momin Kh\u00e1n and the Governor of Broach united their forces and succeeded in regaining Jambusar. With this their success ended. D\u00e1maji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r advanced to the aid of Sad\u00e1shiv R\u00e1mchandra, the Peshwa\u2019s deputy, and together they defeated Momin Kh\u00e1n, laying waste his territory. Suing for peace, Momin Kh\u00e1n was forced to pay the Peshwa half of his revenue, to admit a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 agent into Cambay, and to make good the difference between \u00a38400 (Rs. 84,000), the amount of tribute paid during the two preceding years, and the half of his revenues.\n\nFrom 1760 to 1766, though Momin Kh\u00e1n kept on good terms with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, his exactions and oppressions half emptied the city. In 1766, his minister, \u00c1ga Rashid Beg, hit on a plan for obtaining the Br\u00e1hmans\u2019 hidden treasures. Asked to meet in one place to read prayers and perform incantations for Momin Kh\u00e1n\u2019s health, Br\u00e1hmans came, and, at the close of the day, received 6d. (4 as.) each. This went on for six days. On the seventh the courtyard was surrounded, the Br\u00e1hmans seized, and, to force them to discover their treasures, red hot nails were thrust into their hands. With much torture a sum of \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000) was gathered in two days. This cruelty caused lasting injury to Cambay. Many learned Br\u00e1hmans and men of position fled for safety to the English in Surat. Aga Rashid Beg did not long enjoy his master\u2019s favour. Suspected of keeping to himself part of the plunder, he lost his office and was cast into prison. Afterwards set free, he was, two years later, in attempting to escape to Surat, stopped by the Naw\u00e1b, and murdered.\n\nAt this time (1766) Cambay was so harassed by K\u00e1thi and Koli forays, that Momin Kh\u00e1n agreed to pay them a yearly sum of \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000), and, provided they did not plunder his villages, allowed them to pass unchallenged through his lands. After D\u00e1m\u00e1ji\u2019s death (1768, August), Momin Kh\u00e1n continued on good terms with the G\u00e1ikwar. At the same time he satisfied the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s with a smaller share of his revenues than formerly. From about 1766 the Peshwa\u2019s share came to be spoken of as one-fourth, choth, instead of one-half. About this time (1771), for a sum of \u00a37500 (Rs. 75,000), Momin Kh\u00e1n bought from the British the fort of Tal\u00e1j\u00e1 lately won by them from a band of Koli pirates. The fort was held by the Naw\u00e1b for\n\n---\n\n1 D\u00e1m\u00e1ji, a great chemist, had often tried to find the philosopher\u2019s stone, and it was from breathing the sickly steam of some poisonous drugs that he met his death in the town of P\u00e1tan.

In spite of the crime which gained him office, Mirza Teman proved a good governor, and during his ten years of power the people of Cambay had some respite from the oppression that marked the rest of Momin Kh\u00e1n's reign. In 1782 Mirza Teman was thrown into prison, but was afterwards released and dismissed. Prosperity had now utterly forsaken Cambay. The country round was badly tilled, the people poor and degraded, the villages half empty. The grandeur of the city was mingled with poverty and desolation, the streets were empty, falling mosques and mouldering palaces were the only remains of its ancient magnificence. The weavers were few and poor, and, except the English broker, there was not a merchant of eminence. The revenues had equally decayed. Once the duty from tamarinds alone yielded a yearly revenue of \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000); now, when he had met the Mar\u00e1tha claims, there was left to the Naw\u00e1b not more than \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000). From this he kept up a small establishment, maintaining two thousand Sindians and Arab infantry and five hundred cavalry.\\(^3\\)\n\nDuring the ten years of Mirza Teman's power the Naw\u00e1b of Cambay played an important part in Gujar\u00e1t politics. D\u00e1m\u00e1ji, dying in 1768, left four sons, Say\u00e1ji, Govindr\u00e1v, M\u00e1n\u00e1jir\u00e1v, and Fatehsing. Say\u00e1ji being of weak intellect the second son Govindr\u00e1v claimed to succeed, and this claim was, in 1768, recognized by the Peshwa. This arrangement continued till, in 1772, Fatehsing induced the Peshwa to recognize Say\u00e1ji's claim, and to appoint Fatehsing to be Say\u00e1ji's deputy. Then followed the intrigues at Poona that ended in the murder of Nar\u00e1y\u00e1nr\u00e1v, and the succession of his uncle Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v or Raghuba. Siding with Govindr\u00e1v, the new Peshwa despatched him to Gujar\u00e1t with orders to remove Fatehsing from Baroda. Momin Kh\u00e1n, who had formerly supported Fatehsing, thus became opposed to the interests of Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v, and when, in the next turn of affairs, Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v reached Cambay a suppliant for help, Momin Kh\u00e1n refused to admit him, and Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v was forced to move on to Bh\u00e1vnagar and from there to Bombay.\n\nTwo year later (1774) Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v returned to Cambay. Backed by an English detachment he was anxious to be revenged for Momin Kh\u00e1n's rudeness. 'Strip him of his city' was his prayer to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This fort lies on the east coast of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, a little north of Gopn\u00e1th point.

The conditions were that the Naw\u00e1b should hold the fort as one of the Company's servants, that when necessary he should allow the Company's troops to use it, and, unless allowed by the Company, should permit no one else to hold it.

But for this there seemed no sufficient reason, nor was it wise to remove one of the few remaining obstacles to Mar\u00e1tha power in Gujar\u00e1t. It was better to reconcile their allies, and Sir Charles Mallet, the Resident, succeeded in inducing Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v to forego his grudge against Momin Kh\u00e1n and present him with valuable gifts. Shortly after, not more than thirty miles from Cambay, was fought the battle of Arr\u00e1s, in which, not without severe loss, Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v, by the help of the English, defeated Fatehsing and the Mar\u00e1tha army. Then (1779) came the change in English politics which led them to abandon Raghn\u00e1th\u2019s cause and allow Fatehsing to rule in Gujar\u00e1t. When English influence ceased, Momin Kh\u00e1n went back to his alliance with Fatehsing, and in 1777 aided Fatehsing in his contest with Govindr\u00e1v. About the same time Fatehsing pressed Momin Kh\u00e1n to join him in stopping the K\u00e1thi forays. Momin Kh\u00e1n agreed, and, undertaking to maintain a line of posts to keep the K\u00e1this from passing east of the S\u00e1barmati, he received six villages yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a3900 (Rs. 9000). In spite of this agreement Momin Kh\u00e1n tried to keep up friendly relations with the K\u00e1this. But hearing of his league with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, they plundered great part of his lands. Forced to treat them as enemies, Momin Kh\u00e1n posted fifteen hundred foot and five hundred horse along the eastern bank of the S\u00e1barmati. As this garrison cost more than the original allotment, Momin Kh\u00e1n, in addition to his former grant, received from Fatehsing sums amounting in all to more than \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000). Of this, \u00a3900 (Rs. 9000) were from Fatehsing; \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) from the Peshwa, and \u00a3250 (Rs. 2500) from the revenues of the M\u00e1th sub-division.\n\nAfter the British capture of Ahmedabad (1780), Fatehsing, who received the Peshwa\u2019s share in the revenues of Gujar\u00e1t north of the Mahi, agreed to remit the Cambay tribute. In return for this concession, Momin Kh\u00e1n made over to the English the charge of the Cambay custom-house gate. This gate was restored to the Naw\u00e1b in 1783, and, at the same time, under the treaty of Salb\u00e1i (1783, February 24th), the right of the Peshwa to share in the Cambay revenues was renewed.\n\nShortly before this (1782), Mirza Teman, the Cambay minister, was dismissed from office. The Mirza was succeeded by Kutbi Kh\u00e1nnum, a woman of great beauty, who formerly had much influence over Momin Khan. Her heavy extortions were the more keenly felt after the comparative security of Mirza Teman\u2019s management. Kutbi\u2019s term of power did not last long. Before many months,\n\n1 These villages were Kanjat, Kanessa, Sath, and Bhinbhina in Petl\u00e9d; and Jhikar and Gor\u00e1r in Matar.\n2 Grant Duff, II, 288, 324, and Bom. Gov. Sel.

She was the wife of \u00c1ga Rashid Beg, the minister who devised the scheme for torturing the Cambay Br\u00e1hmans. While her husband was minister (1760-1766), Kutbi Kh\u00e1nnum was on terms of intimacy with Momin Kh\u00e1n, to whom she had borne a son, Mirza J\u00e1ni. This woman, at the time of her husband\u2019s death (1768), retired to Surat. Weary of her life there she asked leave to return. Her wish was readily granted, and in 1782 she came to Cambay, and succeeded the disgraced minister, Mirza Teman.\n(1783), after ruling for thirty-five years, Momin Kh\u00e1n died. In spite of his valour, military skill, and tact, Momin Kh\u00e1n\u2019s rule was ruinous to Cambay. His heavy and ill-judged levies forced from the city the wealth and skilled industry which might, under better management, have outlived the change in the course of trade and the unchecked disorder of the rest of the province.\n\nFour months before his death Momin Kh\u00e1n chose as his successor Muhammad Kuli, the son of Najam Kh\u00e1n, whom he had poisoned in 1748. This Najam Kh\u00e1n had been married to Nur Jah\u00e1n, or Kh\u00e1num Begam, an illegitimate daughter of Momin Kh\u00e1n I, and so a half-sister of Momin Kh\u00e1n II. By her Najam Kh\u00e1n had no issue. But an intimacy with the wife of one of his door-keepers resulted in the birth of a son. Hearing of the child, Kh\u00e1num Begam brought him from a village some distance off, and, changing his name from Mia Manu to Muhammad Kuli, saw that he was well cared for. Besides this connection Muhammad Kuli was son-in-law to Momin Kh\u00e1n II. by marrying Jogni Kh\u00e1num, his daughter by a slave girl. Muhammad\u2019s succession was not unopposed. Taking advantage of the power which Momin Kh\u00e1n II. had allowed to drift into her hands, Kuthi Kh\u00e1num, gaining a strong Moghal party, proclaimed Mirza J\u00e1ni, the son she had borne to Momin Kh\u00e1n II. Muhammad Kuli gained the day, and Kuthi Kh\u00e1num with her sister Jamila Begam and a large number of Moghals were driven from Cambay.\n\nAfter ruling for six uneventful years (1783-1789) Muhammad Kuli died in 1789. He had only one dispute with the neighbouring powers. An offender of the name of T\u00e1pid\u00e1s, flying from a Baroda village, took shelter in Cambay. Asked to give him up, Muhammad refused and allowed him to escape. Fatehsing advanced to Cambay, and finding T\u00e1pid\u00e1s fled, forced Muhammad to pay a fine of \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000). With this exception the six years of Muhammad\u2019s rule was a time of quiet and good government. He left three sons, Fateh Ali, Bande Ali, and Y\u00e1war Ali, the eldest of whom succeeded in 1789.\n\nAbout the same time, at Baroda, M\u00e1n\u00e1jir\u00e1v succeeded his brother Fatehsing. One of M\u00e1n\u00e1ji\u2019s first acts was to demand back the six villages granted by Fatehsing, to pay for the garrison against the K\u00e1thi inroads. Fateh Ali refused, and it was finally arranged that the Baroda state should be allowed to withhold the yearly money payment of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) on account of the K\u00e1this, and that the six villages should continue to belong to Cambay. Fateh Ali\u2019s next act was to send a large present to Delhi. In return he received the title of Najam-ud-daulah Momt\u00e1zz-ul-mulk Momin Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Dil\u00e1war Jang, and the rank of a commander of six thousand as Naw\u00e1b of Cambay. In the early years of Fateh Ali\u2019s rule, Cambay was from time to time disturbed by Mar\u00e1tha demands. In 1792 the six disputed villages were again annexed by Baroda, but were a second time restored to\n\n---\n\n1 Momin Kh\u00e1n\u2019s exactions made Cambay a heap of ruins. Except the English factory and the dwellings of the English brokers, there was (1787) no house worth looking at. The people had failed to pay their taxes and the late Naw\u00e1b had ordered their houses to be pulled down. Even the large mosque had been confiscated and made a store house. Hove\u2019s Tours : Bom. Gov. Sel. XVI, 50.\nCambay. About 1799 \u00c1tm\u00e1r\u00e1m Bh\u00e1u, the Peshwa\u2019s agent, entered the Cambay district, and was bought off only by the payment of \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000). Again, in 1800, B\u00e1b\u00e1ji \u00c1p\u00e1ji, general of \u00c1nandr\u00e1v G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, in passing to collect the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r tribute, under the name of arrears, extorted from Fateh Ali a sum of \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000).\n\nAt this time so low had Cambay fallen that the British factory was (1797, Aug. 21st) \u2018negative in point of utility and in expense positively burdensome\u2019. The Bombay Board were of opinion that everything could be done through native brokers. Before this opinion could be acted on, events took a turn which brought the British Government into closer relations with Cambay. Malh\u00e1rr\u00e1v of Kadi attempted to take Baroda from his cousin \u00c1nandr\u00e1v. The Bombay Government, appealed to for help by their ally the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, sent a detachment of troops, which under the command of Major Walker, arrived in Cambay in 1802. Mr. Duncan, Governor of Bombay, accompanied this force and held interviews with R\u00e1vji \u00c1p\u00e1ji, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s minister. The arrangements then made (1802, March and June) did not affect the position of the Cambay state. But by the treaty of Bassein, passed soon after (1802, December 31st), all the Peshwa\u2019s rights in Cambay were ceded to the British. In the following year (1803, May 24th), at the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s request the Bombay Government agreed to farm the tribute to the Naw\u00e1b for four years, the Naw\u00e1b engaging to pay yearly a sum equal to the amount formerly paid to the Peshwa. This arrangement has since remained in force.\n\nIn the following years, B\u00e1b\u00e1ji \u00c1p\u00e1ji, by putting a stop to the K\u00e1thi forays, made the Cambay forts along the east bank of the S\u00e1barmati no longer necessary. Under these circumstances, in 1806, B\u00e1pu K\u00e1shi, commander of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s Mahi K\u00e1nta force, received orders to annex the six villages whose possession had so often been disputed by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and Cambay. At the same time B\u00e1pu K\u00e1shi took bonds from many of the Cambay villages for the payment of sums of money. Fateh Ali complained to the Governor of Bombay, and Major Walker, the British Resident at Baroda, had the bonds restored under promise that the English Government would put pressure on Fateh Ali to pay the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s lawful claims.\n\nIn 1818, in consequence of the increase of their power in Gujar\u00e1t, the British Resident at Cambay was withdrawn, and, in his place, the chief executive officer in the newly constituted district of Kaira was appointed Agent.\n\nIn October 1823 Fateh Ali Kh\u00e1n died. As he left no male issue he was succeeded by his brother Bande Ali Kh\u00e1n, who ruled for eighteen years. Dying (1841, 15th March) without a son, the succession went to his brother Y\u00e1war Ali Kh\u00e1n. This prince waived his right in favour of his son Husain Y\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n the present ruling Naw\u00e1b, whose hereditary title is Najam-ud-daul\u00e1h\n\n---\n\n1 East India Papers (1795-1800), III. 16.\n2 Bom.

J\u00e1fr Ali Kh\u00e1n, the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s eldest son, at present (1880) twenty-four years of age, is quiet and well conducted. He is married to a relation of his mother\u2019s, the daughter of the Mulvi of Masulipatam. There is no male issue.\n\nSince 1818, the relations between the Cambay state and the Imperial Government have remained unchanged. There are no treaty engagements, and, except the payment of a yearly tribute, the Naw\u00e1b of Cambay is almost uncontrolled in the management of his state. Over his own people he has the power of life and death. There is no appeal from any of his awards; and the Political Agent, the Collector of Kaira, exercising no direct authority, is little more than the recognised medium between the Naw\u00e1b and the Government of Bombay. Under the proclamation of 1857 the right of any succession valid according to Muhammadan law, has been secured to the Naw\u00e1b, and he is entitled to a salute of eleven guns. The state has a military force of six field and two other guns, thirty-five artillery-men, 250 cavalry, and 330 infantry and police.\n\nIn 1838, three years before the accession of the present Naw\u00e1b, in spite of the long peace, the lands round Cambay were desolate, the city ruinous, and its trade dead. Since 1838 trade has to some extent revived. But the improvement is small. No efforts have been made to foster industry or commerce. The harbour has been left to itself, and no steps have been taken to clear the silt or make less dangerous the gulf\u2019s troublesome navigation.\n\nThe following is the Cambay family tree:\n\n(I.) Mirza J\u00e1fr Najam-ud-daul\u00e1h, Momin Kh\u00e1n I. (died 1743).\n\n(II.) Muft\u00e1khir Kh\u00e1n, Nur-ud-din Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Momin Kh\u00e1n II. (died 1783).\n\n(III.)

(present Chief).\n\nJ\u00e1fr Ali Kh\u00e1n (Heir-Apparent).\n\nThe order of succession is indicated by Roman numerals.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nADMINISTRATION.\n\nThe lands of Cambay are tilled either by peasants holding direct from the state, or by the yearly tenants of the village headmen. The peasant-holding, kh\u00e1t\u00e1bandi, system is in force in the better class lands capable of regular tillage; the yearly tenant, ganotia, system is ordinarily adopted only in the poorer soils.\n\nUnder the peasant-holding system land pays the state a fixed sum, and, though without the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s leave he has no power to transfer the land, the holder cannot be ousted so long as he pays his rent. In ordinary cases the right of occupancy has no money value. But if the former holder has improved the land, the new comer pays such sums as arbitrators or a committee of villagers may award. Under the yearly tenant, ganotia, system there is no fixity either of possession or of rent. This system is commonly in use only in the poorer lands which, from year to year, the village headman lets out at low rates to any one willing to take them.\n\nNo land is liable to be sold in payment of the holder\u2019s private debts. And, though there is no special exemption in favour of the cultivator\u2019s property, the civil courts are expected to use discretion in attaching field tools.\n\nExcept in the coast, b\u00e1r\u00e1, villages, the land assessment is paid in money. In the coast villages, after deducting the estimated cost of production, the crop is divided into two equal parts, one for the state, the other for the cultivator. A few large landholders sublet their fields. But, except the poorer soils cultivated by yearly tenants, the land is generally tilled by the person in whose name it is held.\n\nAs the state has not yet been surveyed, the method of realizing the land revenue is somewhat rough and irregular. For first-class land capable of yielding sugarcane, opium, and tobacco, found almost solely in Undel and Pachisg\u00e1m, the rates sometimes rise to nearly \u00a35 the acre (Rs. 35 the bigha). In other villages the assessment on the best lands varies from 14s. to \u00a32 16s. the acre (Rs. 5 - 20 the bigha); on rice land from 5s. 6d. to 17s. the acre (Rs. 2 - 6 the bigha); and on dry-crop land from 5s. 6d. to 14s. the acre (Rs. 2 - 5 the bigha). These rates, though nominally fixed, are changed at the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s pleasure. Compared with the corresponding assessment in the neighbouring British lands these rates are high. On the other hand remissions are constantly claimed and granted, while the\nrecord of the area under cultivation is often so imperfect that many a farmer raises crops on double the area for which he pays. The collection of the revenue is nominally spread over a large part of the year, and certain days, in November, December, February, and April, are set apart for paying the different instalments. These rent days are seldom kept, the time for collecting depending on the pleasure of the manager, or on the needs of the state.\n\nFormerly the land revenue was farmed. Now, except in a few villages, the state share is collected by village accountants under the control of a central superintendent, daroga, with whom are associated two head-quarter clerks, a Hindu, and a Musalm\u00e1n. Arrears are strictly collected. A certain number of men are billetted on the defaulter, and, besides the cost of their keep, he has to pay a daily money fine of from 3d. to 2s. (2 as.-Re. 1). Should stronger measures seem necessary, the old method of setting the debtor in the sun with a block of wood on his head is said to be still occasionally resorted to. When poverty, or loss by fire is proved, the revenue superintendent has power to grant special remissions. In villages whose revenues are farmed, if the people fail to pay their rents, the revenue superintendent aids the contractor in recovering his demands.\n\nThe Naw\u00e1b pays little attention to the land revenue, and, as a rule, its management is loose rather than oppressive. In the villages assigned to the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s sons there may be occasional oppression, but in these cases complaints do not reach the Naw\u00e1b. On the whole, the land assessment is by no means heavy, and its collection is not so irksome as to make the people move to the neighbouring Kaira villages.\n\nExcept serious cases tried by the Naw\u00e1b in person all ordinary criminal charges are heard in the city by the city magistrate, kotw\u00e1l, and in the districts by the rural magistrates, darog\u00e1s. Cases calling for severe punishment are by them referred to the Naw\u00e1b, who also hears criminal appeals. The Munshi, who carries on correspondence with the Political Agent at Kaira, is the head of the political department.\n\nThere are three civil courts: the original civil court, diw\u00e1ni ad\u00e1lat; the first appellate court, tajv\u00e1zani; and the highest appellate court, diw\u00e1n kh\u00e1na, where the Naw\u00e1b, assisted by an assessor, hears final appeals. In miscellaneous appeals and caste disputes the head of the merchants\u2019 guild, nagar seth, and one or two chief merchants act as assessors. In cases of Hindu law a hereditary paid Sh\u00e1stri is attached to the court. Most debt cases are decided by arbitration. When brought into court the judge is guided by the following rules. If the suit is filed within six years of the date of the loan, both principal and interest are awarded; if the suit is filed after six and within twelve years, only the principal can be claimed; if between twelve and twenty years have passed, only half the principal\n\n---\n\n1 The Naw\u00e1b\u2019s second son is now (1880) city magistrate.\ncan be recovered; if after twenty years, only one-fourth; and no suit may be brought after thirty years from the time the claim began to run. A fee of 2\u00bd per cent is taken on all money claims. The failure of the defendant to pay the amount decreed is commonly punished by imprisonment.\n\nThere is a divorce court presided over by a salaried and hereditary officer styled K\u00e1zi who is an assessor in all religious matters. As head of the registration department the K\u00e1zi signs and seals all bonds affecting immovable property. The proceeds of the registration fees are equally divided among the Naw\u00e1b, the Munshi, and the K\u00e1zi. In divorce cases, the K\u00e1zi levies fees graduated according to the social standing of the person claiming relief. The following statement shows what fees are charged and how the revenue is distributed. In cases of certified poverty part of the fees is remitted:\n\n**Divorce Fees.**\n\n| Claimant                        | Amount | Naw\u00e1b | Superintendent (P\u00e1roy) | Clerk (M\u00e1h\u00e1) | Messengers | K\u00e1zi | K\u00e1zi's Deputy | K\u00e1zi's Messenger | Munshi |\n|---------------------------------|--------|-------|------------------------|--------------|------------|------|---------------|-----------------|--------|\n| Cultivators                     |        |       |                        |              |            |      |               |                 |        |\n| Lava Kanhi                      | \u00a33     | s. d. | \u00a33 6 10                | 18           | 4          | 2    | 14            | 3               | 1      |\n| Kadra                           | 4 18   |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n| Gardeners                       | 3 18   |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n| Milkmen                         | 5 6    |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n| Oil-sellers and blacksmiths     | 4 8    |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n| Watermen, tailors, and bakers   | 3 8    |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n| Cotton-cleaners                 | 3 8    |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n| Fishermen                       | 3 7    |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n| Barbers, shoemakers, and Mus\u00e1l\u00e1n Koli\u00e1 | 2 18 |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n| Market-gardeners, water-carriers| 2 8    |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n| Mus\u00e1l\u00e1n-Dhed\u00e1s and Mus\u00e1l\u00e1n soldiers | 1 4    |       |                        | 18           | 2          | 2    | 4             | 1               | 0 6    |\n\nCivil and criminal codes have lately been introduced, and the procedure is supposed to be regulated by their provisions. The practice is irregular and open to abuse. In the criminal courts neither summons nor warrants are issued, and persons apprehended on the merest suspicion, are often kept until bail is given, evidence found, or release purchased. Civil justice is little less free from abuse. Complaints of bribery and extortion are general, and, so little are the court officers controlled, that decrees, passed by the Naw\u00e1b himself, are said sometimes to be set aside or left unexecuted. No appeal lies to the Political Agent. But a complaint, found by him to be reasonable, can be referred to the Naw\u00e1b, and in such cases justice is usually done.\n\nAs in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t, the village headman is called chief, *mukhi*. The office is sometimes, though not always, hereditary; and the holder is rewarded by the grant of rent-free land. He has no magisterial powers. The other village officers are the *r\u00e1vania*, a\nRajput, Koli, or Musalm\u00e1n paid from 4s. to 6s. (Rs. 2 - 3) a month, who helps in collecting the state demands, guards collections on their way to the treasury, and does the ordinary work of a messenger; and the tracker, *pagi*, a Koli, paid in land and commonly held responsible for stolen property traced within the limits of his village, who goes with the headman round the village at night, watches, and tracks thieves. In large villages there is a Koli or Musalm\u00e1n messenger and pound-keeper, *hav\u00e1ld\u00f3r*, paid in grain and by twenty per cent of the pound fees. In some places the villagers keep private watchmen.\n\nIn 1879 the gross state revenue was returned at \u00a338,863 (Rs. 3,88,630). This is derived from four chief sources, land assessment, salt, land and sea customs, and miscellaneous cesses. The yearly tribute settled under the treaty of Bassein (1802) is \u00a32547 10s. (Rs. 25,475-5-1). The British Government has also a share in certain cesses, which in 1878 yielded \u00a3105 14s. (Rs. 1057). During the same year the British share in the salt excise amounted to \u00a36171 18s. (Rs. 61,719).\n\nThe cash received from the different branches of revenue is lodged in treasuries in the Naw\u00e1b's palace. The district land revenue is, under the care of a superintendent, kept in a separate treasury called the country office, *pargana kacheri*. From the land revenue all establishment, food, and clothing charges are met, and the balance transferred to the Naw\u00e1b's private treasury. The receipts from the coast villages, collections on account of land and sea customs, and the proceeds of the miscellaneous cesses are considered the Naw\u00e1b's private revenue and are at once lodged under the care of the private treasurer, *tosh\u00e1kh\u00e1na d\u00e1roga*.\n\nIn former years the Cambay customs and transit duties were a heavy burden on trade. The duties were (1854), on cotton 4\u00b731 per cent, on carnelians 7\u00b750 per cent, on cotton goods 6\u00b705 per cent, on grain 6\u00b750 per cent, and on tobacco 10\u00b798 per cent. These duties were greatly enhanced by unauthorized levies extorted from merchants at every toll-bar, *n\u00e1ka*. In 1854 the attention of the Bombay Government was drawn to this taxation, which, besides injuring Cambay, was seriously affecting the traffic through the neighbouring districts. After much negotiation the Naw\u00e1b agreed to fixed and moderate duties. The toll-bars were removed, and, instead, a single charge was levied. Of the proceeds of this tax, which varies from one-half to three per cent on the estimated value of the article, the British Government receives one-fourth, and the remaining three-fourths are handed over to the Naw\u00e1b. The terms of this agreement were revised in 1871, when it was provided that, to protect the roads, the Naw\u00e1b should maintain from his share a fixed establishment of foot and mounted police. The yearly cost of the police force amounts to nearly \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000). Of the balance two-thirds are now spent on improving the city of Cambay, and the remaining third on education.\n\n---\n\n1 *Tosh\u00e1kh\u00e1na* is literally the present department.\nChapter IV.\n\nAdministration.\n\nThough Cambay is recognized as a British port, only the British tariff of valuations, not the tariff of duty, is in force. British rates are generally levied on imports, but on exports there is a uniform charge of five per cent. The custom-house arrangements are equally in the hands of the Naw\u00e1b and of the Bombay Government. Two sets of books are kept, and the Naw\u00e1b has power to object to any decision passed by the British Customs Officer.\n\nThe Imperial share of the land and customs revenue is realized by a superintendent, mah\u00e1lkari, a clerk, and five messengers, maintained, under the Collector of Kaira, at a yearly cost of \u00a3144 (Rs. 1440), with a guard of a head and six constables of the Kaira police.\n\nBesides rent the land yields three minor items of revenue, the b\u00e1jri cess, the kotra cess, and grazing fees. The b\u00e1jri cess is a tax of 3s. 5\u00bdd. (Cambay Rs. 2) on every cart-load of millet. The kotra cess is a tax of one per cent on every holding paying a yearly rent of \u00a38 13s. (Cambay Rs. 100) and upwards. The object of this cess is to pay for the keep of the Naw\u00e1b's horses. The grazing fee, paid by Rab\u00e1ris and other cattle owners, is a charge varying from 1s. 9\u00bdd. to 6s. 11\u00bdd. (Rs. 1-4) the head of cattle. The yearly collections amount to about \u00a3430 (Cambay Rs. 5000).\n\nOf non-agricultural cesses there are two: the craft tax, mohatarfa vero, and the profession tax, kasab vero. The tax on crafts yields about \u00a3170 8s. (Cambay Rs. 2000) a year. The profession tax is levied at the following rates: on each oil-press 3s. 5\u00bdd. to 8s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-5); on each cotton-carding machine, 3s. 5\u00bdd. to 8s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-5); on each shoemaker's shop, 3s. 5\u00bdd. (Rs. 2); on each grocer's, 5s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 3); on each blacksmith's, 3s. 5\u00bdd. to 8s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-5); on each carpenter's, 3s. 5\u00bdd. to 8s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-5); on each tailor's, 5s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 3); on each goldsmith's, 5s. 2\u00bdd. to 11s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-13); and on each potter's wheel, 3s. 5\u00bdd. to 5s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-3). In the case of tanners the tax, 17s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 10) and upwards according to the size of the village, is levied in one sum from the whole community, and from weavers of the Dhed caste a charge of 8s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 5) is made on each loom. In addition to these special cesses, there are one or two taxes peculiar to the city of Cambay. The chief of these is a house-tax, at present fixed at a uniform rate of 1s. 1d. (10 annas). This tax, known as the k\u00e1thia p\u00e1l vero, was originally levied to protect the people from K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r robbers. A special additional fee is levied on houses in the better streets. There is also a market cess of 6\u00bd per cent on all articles sold.\n\nPost.\n\nThe post is under the charge of the Inspector of Post Offices, Gujar\u00e1t Division. From Cambay a runner passes daily through Petl\u00e1i to \u00c1nand Railway Station in Kaira.\n\nInstruction.\n\nAccording to the 1872 census, of 38,134, the total Hindu male population, 3541 or 9\u00b728 per cent were able to read and write, or were being taught. Of 33,371, the total Hindu female population, 23 were able to read and write, or were being taught. Of 6095 Musalm\u00e1n males, 487 or 7\u00b799 per cent were able to read and write, or were being taught. Of 5787 Musalm\u00e1n females only\ntwo were able to read and write. Within the last two or three years education has made much progress. Besides several private schools, there are now two schools under the charge of the Political Agent, with an average attendance of some 280 children. These schools are supported from a grant of one-third of the Naw\u00e1b's inland customs, a yearly subscription of \u00a350 (Rs. 500) from the Naw\u00e1b, and the school fees. Seven scholarships, at a cost of \u00a3700 (Rs. 7000), have lately been endowed by Mr. Varjivand\u00e1s M\u00e1nekchand, a Cambay merchant. To complete their studies the holders are sent to the Nadi\u00e1d High School.\n\nChapter IV.\nAdministration.\nInstruction.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nChapter V. Cambay, north latitude 22\u00b0 21' and east longitude 72\u00b0 48', with a population of 33,709 souls, is the seventh city in Gujar\u00e1t and the fifteenth in the Bombay Presidency. Rectangular in shape it covers about four square miles. Portions of its old brick wall remain. Through the wall, besides two small openings for foot and horse travellers, there are eight gateways broad enough for carriages. Beginning from the north and passing east, the chief gates are, on the north two, the Fateh and Pit; on the east three, the M\u00e1ndla, Chaka, and Gav\u00e1ra; on the south two, the Furza and Mak\u00e1i; and on the west the Ch\u00e1k\u00e1mali gate. Beyond the city wall, though the sites of the old suburbs can scarcely be traced, there are some modern buildings and a few of the older remains in a state of good repair. Of these the chief are, on the north-east of the city beyond the M\u00e1ndla gate, a reservoir also called M\u00e1ndla, a garden, and some fine buildings, said to have been raised in 1802 in honour of Mr. Duncan, Governor of Bombay. On the north-west, beyond the Fateh gate, is another large reservoir, and a small house, said to have belonged to Kali\u00e1nr\u00e1i, the reputed founder of the present town. Kali\u00e1nr\u00e1i's memory is still preserved by the V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s of the city, who, on Dasera day (October), visit the garden and perform ceremonies in his honour. Near this are other gardens kept in order by the Naw\u00e1b, and at a short distance is the Idga or Musalm\u00e1n place of prayer. Here, twice a year, on the Romz\u00e1n and Bakri \u00cdds, the Naw\u00e1b, with a large retinue, comes to worship. On the south-east, beyond the Furza gate, is the English burying-ground surrounded by a well built wall. And, on the south, beyond the Mak\u00e1i gate, are some warehouses and stores.\n\nThe chief buildings are the Naw\u00e1b's palace, his court, and the dwellings set apart for his household, all in fair order. There is also the large residence, originally the English Factory, and afterwards made into a sanitarium for European officers. This property was, in 1835, sold for \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000) to Karsetji Pestanji Modi, a Bombay P\u00e1rsi. At present part of the building is occupied by the resident British Native officer, and the rest is used as a public rest-house.\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs' Cities of Gujar\u00e1shtra, 160.\nOf the older remains, the chief is the J\u00e1ma Mosque, built about the beginning of the fourteenth century,\\(^1\\) from the stones of Hindu temples. It measures 200 feet by 210, and its inner court 120 by 135. Except that it is somewhat smaller, its plan and arrangements are almost the same as those of the Altamash Mosque at Ajmir. In other respects the two buildings are most unlike. The three Cambay arches are plain to baldness, and low to suit the Jain pillars of the interior. The pillars, all taken from Hindu temples, though arranged with little care, form a picturesque whole. One of the mosque's most remarkable features is the tomb of Imr\u00e1r bin Ahmad Kajar\u00e1n\u00ed the founder. Wholly composed of Hindu materials, it is two stories high, and was crowned with a dome twenty-eight feet in diameter. The parts, taken apparently from different buildings, were so badly fitted, that, after standing some three centuries, it fell, and has since remained a ruin, singularly picturesque in form and exquisite in detail.\\(^2\\)\n\nAnother place of Musalm\u00e1n resort, where persons who have escaped shipwreck come to pay vows, is known as the Kh\u00e1ja Kheder Mosque. Near the site of this mosque are the ruins of an old light-house. Outside of the city walls, near the N\u00e1rangshar reservoir, is the tomb of a saint known as the B\u00e1lsir Pir held in much veneration by Bohora Musalm\u00e1ns. Of Hindu remains there is a Jain temple of P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th. This is of two parts, one above ground, the other under ground with the date 1526 (S. 1582). There are also, in and near the city, nine reservoirs, of which the chief is called N\u00e1rangshar. These works are said to have been built at the charge of a dancing girl, named Nagina, who chose for each a word beginning with N, the initial letter of her own name. Many wells near the city are of great age and much beauty. One object of some interest is the hospital for animals maintained by the Naw\u00e1b, out of respect for the wishes of his Jain subjects.\n\nOn the whole Cambay is poor and ill-cared for. Little money is available to improve the town or repair its buildings; and, with dull trade and few industries, its craftsmen and traders have little to spend on their shops and houses.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Fergusson gives 1325, Mr. Summers (Bom.

The K\u00e1veri, from its source in Mankunia hill, flows, by the town of B\u00e1nsda, towards Chikhli and Balsar, where, at V\u00e1garach, it joins the Ambika. There are few wells and ponds. From the large area of brushwood and forest, much of the water is always charged with vegetable matter and unwholesome. After a season of scanty rainfall, even bad water is very scarce. To improve the supply, at a cost of about \u00a330 (Rs. 300) two wells were sunk in 1877, one at Champaldhara, and the other at Vandarvela. In 1878, \u00a3310 (Rs. 3100) were spent on six wells and two ponds. A dam, b\u00e1ndh\u00e1ra, has, at a cost of \u00a3118 (Rs. 1180), been built across the river near B\u00e1nsda.\n\nThough by clearing forests the climate has of late somewhat improved, it is still, especially from the end of the rainy season to the middle of the cold weather (October - January), unhealthy. Fevers and other diseases prevail throughout the year. The average rainfall for the last three years is estimated at sixty-four inches. In the hot weather the temperature is much the same as in Chikhli, the thermometer ranging from 90\u00b0 to 105\u00b0.\n\nOf minerals a black hard stone useful for building is found in abundance. Of timber trees, there are teak, s\u00e1g, Tectona grandis; blackwood, sisam, Dalbergia sissoo; haladvan, Adina cordifolia; tanachh, Ujainia dalbergioides; s\u00e1dado, Terminalia arjuna; bibo,\n\n---\n\n1 From materials supplied by R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur Keshavl\u00e1i Nathubh\u00e1i, Superintendent of B\u00e1nsda.\nB\u00e1nsda.\n\nProducts.\n\nPterocarpus marsupium; kalam, Stephegyne panifolia; catechu, kher, Acacia catechu; mhowa, mahudo, Bassia latifolia; jambudo, Eugenia jambolana; hasan, Briedelia montana; timru, Diospyros montana; kanti, Acacia kerek; vajari; and kangdoli. Of these haladvan and s\u00e1dado are of special, and the rest of middling, value. Though B\u00e1nsda lies close to the D\u00e1ngs its timber is not nearly so valuable. Till the time of R\u00e1ja Gul\u00e1bsingji (1862-1876), when some lands were reserved in five or six villages, the forests were farmed out and freely used by the cultivators. In 1877-78 to prevent the destruction of valuable timber, teak, blackwood, catechu, tanachh, haladvan, s\u00e1dado, bibo, siven, kanti, vajari, and mahuda were set apart as state trees and can be cut by cultivators only on showing passes, and for housebuilding or field purposes. To cut dh\u00e1man, kalam, kangdoli, suras, timri, dhamodi, bedo, s\u00e1mar, bodra, kirai, and other firewood trees, no pass is required. In 1877, 247 passes were issued, and about \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000) worth of timber and bamboos were cut. Of late, the forest establishment has been increased, and all forest lands suited to the growth of valuable timber have been marked off and are strictly preserved.\n\nAnimals.\n\nExcept that, from scanty pasturage, the cattle are smaller and poorer, the domestic animals do not differ from those found in central Gujar\u00e1t. The chief wild animals are the Tiger, v\u00e1gh, Felis tigris; the Leopard, dipdo, Felis leopardus; the Bear, rinchh, Ursus labiatus; the Hunting Leopard, chit\u00e1h, Felis jubata; the Hog, dukkar, Sus indicus; the Fox, lonkdi, Vulpes bengalensis; the Antelope, kali\u00e1r, Antelope bezoartica; the Four-horned Antelope, bhekar, Tetraceros quadricornis; the Deer, chital, Axis maculatus.\n\nPopulation.\n\nAccording to the 1872 census the population numbered 32,154 souls, of whom 31,313 or 97\u00b73 were Hindus, 620 or 1\u00b79 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 210 or .065 per cent P\u00e1rsis, and 11 \u2018Others\u2019. The percentage of males on the total population was 52\u00b71 and of females 47\u00b79. Of the 31,313 Hindus all but 1436 (males 771, females 665) belong to the k\u00e1l\u00edparaj or black races. Almost all of them are very poor living from hand to mouth, and spending their earnings on spirits. The four chief tribes are Konkna Kanbis, Chodhr\u00e1s, Dhondi\u00e1s, and G\u00e1mt\u00e1s. Of these the Konkn\u00e1s with thirteen clans\u00b9 are the largest. Living in the hilly villages in the south and east and speaking a corrupt Gujar\u00e1ti, though thriftless cultivators they are very faithful and honest. They are firm believers in ghosts and witchcraft. When any one is attacked with fever or other disease, a holy man, bhagat, is called in and is given palm juice, t\u00e1di, and other spirituous drinks. He then makes an offering to the fire, and shaking his head like one possessed, utters some woman\u2019s name as the cause of the sick man\u2019s distress. The woman is supposed to be a witch and is ill-treated by the sick man\u2019s friends sometimes so severely as to cause her death. The P\u00e1rsis, liquor-sellers and revenue contractors, enrich themselves\n\n\u00b9 They are: Bhagaria, Gaekw\u00e1r, Mah\u00e1la, G\u00e1mit, Sarkar, Bhois, Chodhri, J\u00e1dav, G\u00e1en, Moh\u00e1kal, Ber\u00e1ri, Kamdi, and Bedra.\nat the expense of the dark races. Of 87 inhabited villages, 6 had a population of less than 100 souls; 20 from 100 to 200; 43 from 300 to 500; 9 from 500 to 750; 5 from 750 to 1000; 3 from 1000 to 1500; and one from 2000 to 3000. The number of houses was 4050 or eight persons to each house.\n\nThere are some tracts of black land, but over the greater part of the state the soil is light. Rich in the more level tracts to the north and west, it is, among the hills and valleys stony and poor. A few river bank villages water their lands by Persian wheels. Of the whole area only one-sixth is tilled. Of the rest about one-third is arable waste and two-thirds are unfit for tillage. Among the early, kharif, crops are, rice d\u00e2ngar Oryza sativa, guv\u00e2r Cyamopsis psoralioides, tal Sesamum indicum, n\u00e1gli (white and red) Eleusine coracana, kodra Paspalum scrobiculatum, Indian millet juv\u00e1r Sorghum vulgare, banti Panicum spicatum, maize mak\u00e1i\u00ed Zea mays, v\u00e1l Dolichos lablab, adad Phaseolus mungo, and mag Phaseolus radiatus. The late, rabi, crops are castor-oil seed div\u00e9li Ricinus communis, gram chana Cicer arietinum, peas vat\u00e1na Pisum sativum, and l\u00e2ng Lathyrus sativus. Other crops are sugarcane serdi Saccharum officinarum, kulthi Dolichos uniflorus, khars\u00e1n\u00ed and bhagar or var\u00e1hi. Of these, rice, adad, vat\u00e1na, and red and white n\u00e1gli are grown in large quantities. Some of the soil is well suited for sugarcane, raising it with one-fourth less water than elsewhere. The best rice beng\u00e1l\u00eeu is grown at the base of the hills in the beds of small streams. It is planted after three-fourths of the usual rainfall is over, and is nourished by moisture that oozes up from underground.\n\nUnder the revenue contract, ij\u00e1ra, system, which since 1876 is being rapidly replaced by direct settlements with the land-holders, the condition of the cultivating class was far from good. So long as the farmer paid the promised amount, the state did not ask how the rents were gathered, or what was left for the husbandman. The contractors, chiefly P\u00e2rsis, the actual landlords, had all power in their hands. As revenue and police authorities they could do as they pleased. Only when driven by some special oppression did the people appeal to the chief. Besides rents the contractors levied many petty but harassing dues, haks, so that in many cases the cultivator was forced to hand over all his produce, trusting to the contractor\u2019s forbearance and self-interest.\n\n---\n\n1 One village Bib\u00e1b\u00e2ri on the borders of the D\u00e2ngs is waste. Its ownership is in dispute between B\u00e2nsda and the D\u00e2ngs.\n\n2 This very large average household is said to be due to the habits of the aboriginal families who either sleep in the open air or huddle together much more closely than higher class Hindus.\n\n3 There are twenty-two varieties of rice, beng\u00e1l\u00eeu, sukhwel, el\u00e1ichi, gos\u00e1l\u00eeu, s\u00e2l\u00eeu, kada, torna, tulsi\u00fa, d\u00e2bbel, behhad, khadsi, nadagiu, d\u00e2ngi, p\u00e1n, kalvi, kamodi, beng\u00e1l\u00eeu (inferior sort), jiriu, m\u00e1rvel, rdmsal, \u00e1mb\u00e1mohar, and kanichi.\n\n4 The estimated cost and profit of tilling an acre of rice-land of the better sort is: ploughing 6s. (Rs. 3), seed 8s. (Rs. 4), sowing 4s. (Rs. 2), weeding 2s. 6d. (Re. 1\u00bd), cutting 2s. (Re. 1), rent 14s. (Rs. 7); total \u00a31 16s. 6d. (Rs. 18 as. 4). The outturn is estimated at 12\u00bd cwts. (35 mans) worth \u00a33 18s. 9d. or a net profit of \u00a32 2s. 3d. (Rs. 21 as. 2).\nto give back a part for his support. As they were liquor-sellers as well as revenue contractors, most of the crops, even of the better class of cultivators, found their way into the P\u00e1rsi middleman's hands. And even for the well-to-do, the want of local markets and the badness of roads prevented the profitable sale of their field produce. Besides their money and grain payments, they had, village by village, to perform forced and unpaid state labour, *veth*. Gangs, occasionally from long distances had to come into B\u00e1nsda and work for the chief, returning without any payment either in money or grain. They were also in constant fear that the rates should be raised or their land taken over by the contractor. During the last year of his lease, it was usual for the contractor to do his best to enrich himself, taking the tenants' corn and even their cattle. Left often from February till harvest with a too scanty store of even the cheapest grain, the cultivators had to work as labourers and borrow grain from the contractors and V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s.\n\nIn 1876, when the state came under British management, forced unpaid labour was stopped. As the village leases fall in, the lands are measured, a small fixed money rent is imposed, and a settlement made direct with the cultivator. Though the change was fiercely opposed by the contractors, and was not popular even with the land-holders, the condition of the people has, under the new system, steadily improved. Some families have already, to a great extent, freed themselves from their bondage to the middleman, and silver ornaments are worn where they were before unknown. Of only two years of scarcity, 1835 and 1877, do local records remain. In 1835 the crops failed from want of rain, and, in 1877, with 29 instead of about 60 inches, the rice crop was ruined, and remissions, amounting in all to about \u00a3427 (Rs. 4270), had to be granted.\n\nThe money-lenders, M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis, Br\u00e1hmans, and P\u00e1rsis, supply the cultivators with grain, taking back at harvest time double the quantity of grain given for seed, and one and a half times the quantity given for food. Neither land, cattle, nor field tools can be sold to pay private debts. When money is borrowed, the rates of interest vary, according to the debtor's character and position, from nine to eighteen per cent. Almost all transactions, revenue receipts, and state payments, are made in Broach currency. The only exception is, that to supply money for expenditure out of B\u00e1nsda, the revenue contractors have to make one-fourth of their total payments in British currency. The exaction of forced unpaid labour by the state and the revenue contractors has, as noticed above, been stopped. The only skilled labourers in B\u00e1nsda are carpenters, who are paid 9d. (6 annas) a day. Labourers, if paid in cash, get nearly 2d. (1 anna 4 pies) a day, and if in grain, four pounds, *sers*, of rice, or five, of *kodra*. Cartmen are either paid by the day, or at the rate of 2s. (Re. 1) for every twelve miles.\n\nThe country is approached by land only, having neither ports nor navigable rivers. There are two cleared roads, one of eighteen, and the other of two, miles. The two mile road between B\u00e1nsda and the D\u00e1ngs was opened in 1876. A third road, of about seven\nmiles, is being opened between B\u00e1nsda and Un\u00e1i. A bridge on the road between B\u00e1nsda and Hann\u00e1nb\u00e1ri at the cost of \u00a381 (Rs. 810), a weir across the B\u00e1nsda river, and two rest-houses were built in 1877-78. Until the state came under British management, there was no regular post. Now a self-supporting branch post office has been established at B\u00e1nsda, and an office built at a cost of \u00a350 (Rs. 500). One of the lines of communication between Kh\u00e1ndesh and the coast passes through B\u00e1nsda. Formerly pack-bullocks brought from the inland districts large quantities of grain and other merchandise taking back chiefly salt. The opening of the Great Indian Peninsula and the Bombay and Baroda railways, to a great extent, put an end to this through traffic. But since a road for wheeled vehicles has been made, hundreds of timber carts pass every year to and from the D\u00e1ng forests. The manufactures are limited to cotton tape, baskets, and coarse woollen cloth.\n\nDuring the dry season, at B\u00e1nsda, Ankl\u00e1ch, Kh\u00e1mhbha, Limjar, Moti Valjar, and Champaldhara weekly markets, baj\u00e1rs, are held, where traders from Chikhli, Gandevi, and other neighbouring places open booths. Dealings are carried on with the upper classes by cash payments, and, with the dark races, chiefly by barter. At a large fair held every year at Un\u00e1i on the 15th Chaitra (March - April), about 1000 traders attend, offering N\u00e1sik and other Deccan copper and brass vessels, and Ahmedabad waist-cloths, dhotars, worth altogether from \u00a32000 to \u00a32500 (Rs. 20,000 - 25,000). These articles are bought by higher class Hindus who pay in cash. The Dhondi\u00e1s and other dark tribes, in exchange for corn, take coarse cloth and brass ornaments. The average sales vary in value from \u00a31000 to \u00a31500 (Rs. 10,000 - 15,000).\n\nThe B\u00e1nsda chiefs are Solanki Rajputs. Of their early history no details have been obtained. They claim to have ruled at B\u00e1nsda for twenty generations. But the first eight names are doubtful, and no details are available before the opening of the eighteenth century.\u00b9 The ruins of a fortified enclosure near B\u00e1nsda, and the remains of several temples and water works, point to former prosperity. It seems probable that their lands once stretched to the sea coast, and were gradually narrowed by the advance of Musalm\u00e1n power. Virsingji, the first chief of whom details are available, after ruling during the first fifteen years of the eighteenth century, was succeeded by his son R\u00e1ybh\u00e1n\u00edji who, dying in 1739, left by different wives two sons, Gul\u00e1bsingji and Jor\u00e1varsingji. Each claiming the succession for her son, the ladies referred the matter to D\u00e1m\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, who decided that the state should be divided into two equal shares, and one with B\u00e1nsda made over to Gul\u00e1bsing, and the other with Bisanpur given to Jor\u00e1varsing.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 The first eight names are Muldevji, Khadhaldevji, B\u00e1ldevji, Karandevji, Udesingji I., Mol Karanjji, and Udesingji II.\n\u00b2 Bisanpur now belongs to the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r. Half of it was, in 1750, made over by the B\u00e1nsda chief to the Peshwa, who, in the following year, ceded it to D\u00e1m\u00e1ji Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r. The Peshwa took it back in 1760, and restored it in 1762. In 1763 the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r took the whole sub-division, and, in spite of the chief's protest and the Peshwa's order has since held it.\nOn Gul\u00e1bsing's death in 1753, the minister raised a distant cousin to the chiefship. His claim was contested by Jor\u00e1varsing, the late chief's half-brother. In the end, by the arbitration of the Peshwa and Nazim-ud-din Bakshi of Surat, Udesing the cousin was confirmed, and Jor\u00e1var presented with five villages. On Udesing's death about 1770, the succession, disputed by Kiratsing and Parbatsing, was, by the Peshwa's minister, decided in favour of Kiratsing. Ten years later on Kiratsing's death the rival claims of two brothers Virsingji and N\u00e1h\u00e1rsingji were decided in Virsingji's favour, who raised \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000) from the chief of M\u00e1ndvi, and spent it on the Peshwa and his court. On Virsingji's death, in 1789, his brother N\u00e1h\u00e1rsingji claimed the succession. He was strongly opposed by Day\u00e1ram, the late chief's minister, who stated that N\u00e1h\u00e1rsingji had already passed a deed of relinquishment, and that Virsingji's widow was pregnant. The Peshwa's minister decided that N\u00e1h\u00e1rsing should refrain from pressing his claim till the chief's widow was delivered of a child. Disregarding this decision, N\u00e1h\u00e1rsing took B\u00e1nsda by force, and on paying a fee, nazar\u00e1na, of \u00a38500 (Rs. 85,000) was, about 1790, confirmed in the chiefship. From that time, besides succession fees, of a revenue of \u00a33600 (Rs. 36,000), the Peshwa received \u00a3750 (Rs. 7500) as tribute and \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500) as transit dues. Dying in 1793, N\u00e1h\u00e1rsing was succeeded by his son R\u00e1ising, during whose reign, under the terms of the treaty of Bassein (1802, December 31st), the rights and position of the Peshwa as the over-lord of B\u00e1nsda were transferred to the British. R\u00e1ising was, in 1815, succeeded by his remote cousin Udesingji, who ruled till 1829. On his death Hamirsingji a child of eighteen months was, with the approval of the Bombay Government, adopted by the four widows of Udesing and of his predecessor R\u00e1ising. At first the state was left in charge of the R\u00e1nis, but in 1832, in consequence of their misconduct, affairs were administered by an officer under the supervision of the Agent to the Governor at Surat. Few changes were made in the system of management. The resources of the state were most carefully husbanded, and, in 1852, when the minority of the chief ceased, besides \u00a33145 10s. (Rs. 31,455) in cash, the state had a credit balance of \u00a313,000 (Rs. 130,000) invested in Government notes. In 1856, in consideration of the British Government foregoing its share of transit duties, the chief agreed to pay a yearly tribute, choth, of \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500) and to limit his customs demands to certain rates approved by Government. Dying in 1862, Hamirsingji was succeeded by Gul\u00e1bsing, who on his death in 1876, left one son Prat\u00e1psing, the present chief, then a boy of twelve years. The young chief is being taught at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, while his state is managed by a Superintendent appointed by the British Government.\n\nUnder British management (February 1876 to November 1879) the revenue has risen from \u00a310,384 (Rs. 1,03,84) to \u00a313,986 (Rs. 1,39,860), the chief item of increase being \u00a32508 (Rs. 25,080) under land revenue. The forests, formerly farmed for about \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000), have, since 1877, been brought under state manage-\nment. A road has been opened twenty miles to Chikhli, schools have increased from one with thirty pupils to six with 212, and a dispensary has been established at a yearly cost of about \u00a3170 (Rs. 1700).\n\nThe B\u00e1nsda chief pays a yearly tribute of \u00a3735 (Rs. 7350), and maintains an armed force of 153 men. He has power to try his own subjects for any offence. The family follows the rule of primogeniture, and has been vested with the right of adoption. The chief is entitled to a salute of nine guns.\n\nThe following is the B\u00e1nsda family tree:\n\n(VIII.) Udesingji II.\n(IX.) Virsingji I. (died in 1716).\n(X.) R\u00e1ybh\u00e1nji (died in 1739).\n(XI.) Gul\u00e1bsingji (died in 1753).\n(XII.) Udesingji III. (died about 1770), a cousin of Gul\u00e1bsingji.\n(XIII.) Kiratsingji (died in 1780).\n(XIV.) Virsingji II. (died in 1789).\n(XV.) N\u00e1b\u00e1rsingji (died in 1793).\n(XVI.) R\u00e1ising (died in 1815).\n(XVII.) Udesing IV. (died in 1829), a distant cousin of R\u00e1isingji, adopted.\n(XVIII.) Hamirsingji (died in 1862).\n(XIX.) Gul\u00e1bsingji (died in 1876), a cousin of Hamirsingji.\n(XX.) Prat\u00e1psingji (the present Chief).\n\n1 The names of Udesingji's seven predecessors are given at p. 249.\n\nAs only a small part of the state has been surveyed, the whole area is not accurately known. It may be roughly estimated at about 240 square miles. Of the eighty-eight villages, eighty-one belong to the state, and seven are alienated. The land revenue system, in no way altered when the state was formerly (1833-1852) under British management, was to lease groups of villages to contractors, ij\u00e1rd\u00e1rs, for terms of five years. This system had the advantage of ensuring the state a regular revenue collected with little trouble or detail. But under it, when, in 1876, B\u00e1nsda again came under British management, so wretched was the state of the people that it was determined, as the leases fell in, to replace them by a settlement direct with the cultivators. Accordingly\n\n1 Of the leases running in 1876, one for one village lapsed in 1876; a second for 18 villages in 1877; a third for two villages in 1878; and a fourth for 27 villages in 1879. A fifth for 31 villages lapses in 1880. The land belonging to the town of B\u00e1nsda is divided into four farms, two lapsing in 1877 and two in 1882. The deserted village of Bib\u00e1b\u00e1ri on the borders of the D\u00e1ngs is not farmed.\nin 1875, when the lease of the village V\u00e1gh\u00e1i lapsed, the lands were surveyed, a headman appointed, the holdings of each cultivator measured, and his rent fixed. The contractors, feeling that one chief source of gain was passing from them, strongly opposed the new system, and so thoroughly succeeded in alarming the people, that the rates could be introduced for one year only. From the character and condition of the people, the unhealthiness of the climate, and the distance from markets, the rates had to be pitched very low, rice lands paying only 6s. an acre and dry crop lands from 4s. to 2s.\n\nSince 1876, when the state came under British management, thirty-nine villages, twelve in 1876-77, eight in 1877-78, and nineteen in 1878-79, have been surveyed and new rates fixed. For rice lands the first class acre rates range from 6s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 3 - 10), and the second from 5s. to 11s. (Rs. 2\u00bd - 5\u00bd). For dry crops the first class rates range from 2\u00bds. to 8s.: (Rs.1\u00bc-4), and the second class from 3d. to 6s. (annas 2 - Rs. 3).\n\nIn each of these villages were some substantial holders, paying rents varying from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a325 (Rs. 25 - 250), and taking their crops for sale to Bilimora, Chikhli, Gandevi, and other markets. The financial result of the new system has been from the first group of twelve villages, including V\u00e1gh\u00e1i, a rise in revenue from \u00a3877 (Rs. 8770) to \u00a31252 (Rs. 12,520); in the second group, from \u00a31007 (Rs. 10,070) to \u00a31389 (Rs. 13,890); and for the third group from \u00a33584 (Rs. 35,840) to \u00a35263 (Rs. 52,630). Along with the measurement and assessment of the lands, a village establishment has been introduced. The staff paid by allotments of land includes accountants and messengers, and headmen chosen where possible from the dark, k\u00e1liparaj, races. When the state came under British management, fourteen villages were, during the lifetime of the present grantees, held on quit-rents as service, j\u00e1ghir, charitable, dharm\u00e1da, and subsistence, jiv\u00e1di, grants. Besides these large grants, lands have in many villages been made over in charity to Br\u00e1hmans, and, in reward for services, to revenue officers, the chief\u2019s mercenaries, sibandi, and the Dheds.\n\nFormerly civil disputes might be brought before the chief, who with the help of his manager, gave judgment. But so high a fee, twenty per cent of the award, was levied that civil suits were generally settled by arbitration. Since 1876, the fee has been reduced to ten per cent, and, in 1878, the number of suits had risen to thirty-eight. In 1878 forty-eight boundary disputes were settled, and seventeen remained for decision. The people are quiet and orderly, seldom guilty of crime. Formerly clerks, k\u00e1rtuns, heard criminal complaints, and disposed of them keeping a memorandum of their decisions. Since 1876, the system in force in the neighbouring British districts, has been introduced, the Superintendent being invested with first class, the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r with second class, and his first clerk with third class, magisterial powers. In 1878, of 144 cases sixteen were disposed of by the first class magistrate, fifty-nine by the second, and sixty-nine by the third. Besides these there were three appeal cases, and two committed to the Agent\u2019s court.\nAbout a century ago (1790), the revenue of the state was returned at \u00a33600 (Rs. 36,000), of which \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000) were recovered from the land and other sources, and \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000) from transit dues. In 1852 the revenue stood at \u00a36203 (Rs. 62,030), and from that it steadily rose to \u00a37250 (Rs. 72,500) in 1862, and \u00a311,550 (Rs. 1,15,500) in 1872. Since the introduction of British management, chiefly by the change from the contract to the revenue survey system, the revenue has (1879) risen to \u00a313,986 (Rs. 1,39,860).\n\nIn 1875-76, when the state came under British management, there was only one vernacular school in the town of B\u00e1nsda. In 1878 there were five boys' schools with an attendance of 212 pupils, of whom 185 were of the upper, ujli, and sixty-three of the lower, k\u00e1li, classes. In 1879 a girls' school was started with an attendance of thirty pupils. Four of the six schools are provided with buildings.\n\nIn 1877 a dispensary was opened in B\u00e1nsda. In the first year it was attended by 2557, in the second by 3304, and in the third by 4550, patients. The chief diseases were fevers, bowel complaints and skin affections. In 1878-79, 866 children were vaccinated against 1082 in the year before.\n\nBa'nsda, the chief town in the state, had, in 1872, a population of 2321 souls. It has a dispensary, a school, and a post office.\n\nUna'i, a small village on the north border of the state, with a hot spring, has, on the 15th Chaitra (March - April), a large fair attended by some six or seven thousand people. Twenty-five per cent belong to the An\u00e1vla Br\u00e1hmans, who according to mythology, were, at the Un\u00e1i spring, consecrated as Br\u00e1hmans by the god R\u00e1m. About fifty years ago some religious mendicants set up a female figure and called it the goddess Un\u00e1i. The fair lasts for six days, but the 15th, punam, is the chief holiday.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 A fuller account is given in the Surat Statistical Account. Bom. Gaz. II. 333.\nDharampur.\n\nDescription.\n\nDharampur, a small state under the supervision of the Political Agent of Surat, in 20\u00b0 31' north latitude and 73\u00b0 15' east longitude, lies to the east of the Bals\u00e1r and P\u00e1rdi sub-divisions of Surat. It has an estimated area of about 800 square miles, a population, in 1872, of 74,592 souls or 94:13 to the square mile, and, in 1878, a revenue of \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000).\n\nBoundaries.\n\nIt is bounded on the north by the Chikhli sub-division of the Surat district and the state of B\u00e1snda; on the east by the Peint and Surg\u00e1na states; on the south by Peint, Daman, and Th\u00e1na; and on the west by the Bals\u00e1r and P\u00e1rdi sub-divisions of Surat.\n\nAspect.\n\nThe west of the state is flat, rising gradually towards the eastern hills which separate it from Surg\u00e1na and Peint. The east of the country is hilly, rather bare of trees, and not suited for tillage.\n\nWater.\n\nThe state is well supplied with rivers. The Damanganga, the Kolak, the P\u00e1r, the V\u00e1nki, the Auranga, and the Ambika, all flow through it on their way to the gulf of Cambay. Though of no great size these rivers have pools of water all the year round. Its hills, the number of its water-courses, and its height above the sea, ensure a rapid and complete drainage. There are few lakes or reservoirs of any size, but at all seasons the beds of the rivers and brooks afford a sufficient supply of water. In the north and west are a few wells, but in other parts the wild races are content with water drawn from river-bed holes.\n\nClimate.\n\nExcept in the west the water is bad, the climate unhealthy, and, in the hot season, the heat is severe. The prevailing diseases are fever, cough, dropsy, diarrhoea, and asthma. No accurate estimate of rainfall can be given, but it may be put down as something over seventy inches. No thermometer readings are available, but the mean temperature is probably somewhat lower than in Bals\u00e1r.\n\nProducts.\n\nBesides a sprinkling of jack, phanas, Artocarpus integrifolia, and j\u00e1mb\u00fadi, Eugenia jambolana, there are large numbers of mango, \u00e1mba, Mangifera indica, tamarind, \u00e1mli, Tamarindus indica, and pipal, Ficus religiosa. There is some sparse teak copse wood towards the east, and, towards Peint and Th\u00e1na, a forest of bamboos, teak, mahuda, Bassia latifolia, blackwood, tanach, Oogeinia dalbergioides, catechu, haladv\u00e1n, Adina cordifolia, and s\u00e1dado, Terminalia arjuna, is being preserved and gradually becoming valuable. Tigers, v\u00e1gh, Felis tigris, are now and then found in the eastern hills, and Panthers, dipda, Felis leopardus, wander all over the state. There is hardly any small game.\nAccording to the 1872 census, the population numbered 74,592 souls. Of these 73,428 or 98\u00b75 per cent were Hindus, 910 or 1\u00b72 percent Musalm\u00e1ns, and 254 or '3 per cent P\u00e1rsis. Of the 910 Musalm\u00e1ns 868 were Sunnis and 42 Shi\u00e1s; and of the 254 P\u00e1rsis 239 were Shahansh\u00e1hs and 15 Kadmis. Of the Hindus about 50,000 or 67\u00b703 per cent belonged to the early or dark races, k\u00e1liparaj. Arranged according to occupation, persons employed by the state numbered 760 or 1\u00b701 per cent of the entire population; professional persons 72 or .09 per cent; personal servants 1181 or 1\u00b75 per cent; husbandmen 54,119 or 72\u00b75 per cent; traders 202 or .2 per cent; craftsmen 4962 or 6\u00b76 per cent; and miscellaneous persons 13,296 or 17\u00b78 per cent. There are no beggars. There were 18,521 houses, or on an average, 17\u00b71 to the square mile. Of the whole number, 53, lodging 217 persons or .3 per cent of the entire population with a population per house of 4\u00b709 souls, were of the better sort, tiled and brick walled. The remaining 13,468, accommodating 74,375 persons or 99\u00b77 per cent, with a population per house of 5\u00b75 souls, were thatched huts with mud walls. Of the 264 villages, 133 had 200 inhabitants, 99 had from 200 to 500, 27 from 500 to 1000, 4 from 1000 to 2000, and one from 2000 to 3000.\n\nTowards the west the soil is a poor black, eastwards it becomes poorer, and, amongst the hills near Surg\u00e1na and Peint, yields only scanty crops of the coarser grains. In some hollows among the hills the soil is better, and rice and sugarcane are grown to a limited extent. Except in Dharampur and five or six other villages bordering on Bals\u00e1r and Chikhli, water is drawn both from wells and rivers. Rice, d\u00e1ngar, Oriza sativa, both fine and coarse, is the chief crop; while among pulses tuver, Cajanus indicus, and mag, Phaseolus radiatus, and sugarcane, serdi, Saccharum officinarum, are grown to a limited extent. In the west the crops are the same as those in the east of Bals\u00e1r. To the east and south inferior crops of the poorer grains, such as n\u00e1gli, Eleusine coracana, and kodra, Paspalum scrobiculatum, are grown. The mode of tillage is the same as in the neighbouring British districts.\n\nThere is a cleared road from Dharampur to Bals\u00e1r, passable for carts except during the rains. Another cleared road running from Peint to Chival, a village in P\u00e1rdi, passes through about twenty miles of Dharampur territory. From Chival to P\u00e1rdi, a made road passable for carts all the year round, affords an easy approach to the railway. A cart road passing south through Peint joins Dharampur with the N\u00e1sik station on the Great Indian Peninsula line. A regular post kept up by the chief runs between Bals\u00e1r and Dharampur. Trade is small and there are no available returns. Wood and some grain find their way to Bals\u00e1r and Daman; and articles of luxury and salt pass to Dharampur from Bals\u00e1r. There is some little through traffic from Peint to Bals\u00e1r. Besides the ordinary gold, iron, brass, and wood work, the only manufactures are mats, baskets, and other bamboo articles.\n\n---\n\n1 The details are : Dubl\u00e1is 1150 ; N\u00e1ik\u00e1s 2953 ; Dhundi\u00e1s 17,713 ; K\u00e1thodi\u00e1s 50 ; Bhirpis 73 ; \u00c1gris 4630 ; and Dh\u00e1rlis 23,347 ; total 49,916.\nThe ruling family are Sisodia Rajputs of the Solar race. According to their own traditions, they, about 700 years ago, under a certain R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja, conquered the country from the Bhils; and from their first leader their territory used to be, and, still is, called R\u00e1mnagar. In the 15th century the fort of Parnera belonged to it. In 1576 the chief of Dharampur, or R\u00e1mnagar, went to meet R\u00e1ja Todar Mal at Broach, gave him \u00a31200 (Rs. 12,000) and four horses, and was allowed to assume the rank of 1500 horse, and agreed to serve the Gujar\u00e1t Viceroy with 1000 cavalry. In 1609 to check the incursions of the Ahmednagar armies, a force of 25,000 men was stationed at R\u00e1mnagar in Dharampur, the chiefs sending contingents according to their respective power and position. Shiv\u00e1ji, in his attacks on Surat (1664-1670) was helped by the chiefs of Ghar and R\u00e1mnagar. In 1672 paying a complimentary visit to the chief he took the fort of R\u00e1mnagar, saying that he must have the key of his treasure, Surat, in his own hands. Early in the eighteenth century 1727, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s further increased their power over the R\u00e1ja, taking away seventy-two of his villages and forcing him to pay one-fourth of his transit dues. In 1785, a year of drought, the people rose on the chief, marched on Dharampur, and burnt the castle. The connection of the British with the Dharampur chief dates from 1803, when, under the terms of the treaty of Bassein (1802, December 31st), the Peshwa's claims to tribute were made over to the British. In 1831, R\u00e1ja Vijaydevji fell so deeply in debt that an Arab officer, who had become his surety, threatened force if his claims were not paid. The chief called in the Bombay Government, and an arrangement was made under which many villages were mortgaged to the creditors, and a fixed sum set apart for the chief's support. The chief spent the rest of his life in Surat and Baroda living in the most extravagant and dissolute style, and always sunk in debt. He was in 1857 succeeded by his son R\u00e1md\u00e9vji, and he in 1860 by his son N\u00e1rand\u00e9vji, the present chief, who, living at Dharampur, manages his affairs with prudence, and, subject to the advice and general control of the Political Agent, himself administers the state.\n\n1 The head-quarters would seem to have at first been at Gambhirgad near Sanj\u00e1n, then at Asharsheta, next (1710) at Nagar in the Fatehpur Nagar Haveli. They were finally moved to their present site by R\u00e1ja Dharamdevji in 1766, when the name of the town was changed from Modvegan to Dharampur.\n2 Briggs' Perishta, IV. 51. Grants of land and writings on temples and wells show that Dharampur once included the eight divisions of Gambhirgad, Segva, Asharsheta, B\u00e1h\u00e1r, Udva, Balapur, Dharampuri, and Nagar Haveli.\n3 Bird's Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 344.\n4 Major Watson's History of Gujar\u00e1t, 68.\n5 Orme's Historical Fragments, 27, 28.\n6 These villages were afterwards made over to the Portuguese by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and now form part of Daman.\n7 The state records were destroyed in a fire in 1785, and nothing regarding the early history of the state can now be traced.\n8 Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 318, 319, CXXIII.\n9 The whole of this debt has been paid off by the present ruler N\u00e1rand\u00e9vji.\n10 No family tree of the Dharampur house is available. According to bardic accounts the present chief is the twenty-first in descent from the founder of the house. The names of the former rulers are, R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja, Somsh\u00e1h, Purandarsh\u00e1h, Dharamsh\u00e1h I,\nof the present ruler, was, in 1870, on condition of lowering the rates to Kh\u00e1nesh and paying a yearly sum of \u00a3900, the grant of the perpetual farm of the British share of transit duties.\n\nThe Dharampur chief exercises second class powers, trying his own subjects for every class of offences. The family follows the rule of primogeniture and has a patent, sanad, allowing adoption. He maintains a force of 203 men and is entitled to a salute of nine guns.\n\nThe land revenue and liquor contracts are for the most part farmed to P\u00e1rsis and sometimes to Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns. The farmers, as a rule, pay the R\u00e1ja partly in cash and partly in grain and grass. There are many cesses, but all are generally included in the gross sum leviable from the village householders. The land is not liable to be sold for private debts. The incidence of the land tax is much the same as in B\u00e1nsda.\n\nThe chief is the final authority in civil and criminal matters. Under him is a judge, ny\u00e1y\u00e1dhish, in whose hands all details of procedure are left. Except civil suits settled by arbitration the judge hears both civil and criminal cases. Depositions are taken in his presence and the case is decided summarily. Murder is punished by life imprisonment, other heinous crimes by imprisonment, and less grave offences by fine and whipping. There is no village police. A regular district corps under a chief constable has lately been formed.\n\nThere are three schools at Dharampur, one for girls and two for boys. One is an Anglo-vernaacular school teaching English up to the fifth standard. There are five more schools in other parts of the state. Arrangements have lately been made for introducing vaccination.\n\nArna'i, about nine miles south of Dharampur, has a hot spring where a yearly fair is held on Chaitra sud 15th (April-May). Dharampur, with, in 1872, a population of 3233 souls, has, besides the chief's straggling inconvenient palace, some well-built houses. It has a dispensary and a good school, and something has been done to water and light its streets. Nagar, the ancient capital of the state, about twenty-four miles south-west of Dharampur has a yearly fair on Chaitra sud 15th (April-May). Pa'nikh\u00e1dak and Pangarbari have small yearly fairs in the month of Chaitra (April-May). Pindval and Veta'l, small hills, have the ruins of old forts.\n\nGopush\u00e1h, Jagatsh\u00e1h, N\u00e1ransh\u00e1h I., Dharamsh\u00e1h II., Jagdev, Lakshmandev, Somdev II., Ramdev I., Sadev, Ramdev II., Dharamdev III., N\u00e1randev II., Somdev III., Rupdev, Vijaydev (died 1857), Ramdev III. (died 1860), and N\u00e1randev III. (the present Chief).\nSachin, an estate of twenty villages, scattered through the Chorasi and Jalalpur sub-divisions of Surat, in about 21\u00b0 41' north latitude and 73\u00b0 5' east longitude, has a total area of sixty-five square miles, with, in 1872, a population of 17,103 souls or 263:12 to the square mile, and, in 1878, a revenue of \u00a317,717 (Rs. 1,77,170).\n\nEspecially in the villages of Dumas and Bhimpur at the mouths of the Tapti and Mindhola, the climate is healthy and pleasant. The average yearly rainfall is about thirty-six inches, and the average range of the thermometer from 80\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. The common forms of sickness are fever, cough, and bowel affectious.\n\nThere are no forests, but, as in the neighbouring parts of Surat, there is a free growth of mango, amba, Mangifera indica, tamarind, amli, Tamarindus indica, nim, limbdo, Melia azadirachta, banyan, vad, Ficus indica, piplo, Ficus religiosa, wild date, khajuri, Phoenix sylvestris, and other trees.\n\nThe 1872 census gives a total population of 17,103 souls, of whom 14,678 or 85:8 per cent were Hindus, 2272 or 13:3 per cent Musalmans, and 153 or .9 per cent Parsis. There were, in 1872, 4491 houses, or an average of 100 houses to each square mile. Of these, 415, lodging 1964 persons or 11:4 per cent of the whole population at the rate of 4:7 souls to each house, were built of stone or fire-baked brick. The remaining 4076, accommodating 16,554 souls or 88:6 per cent at the rate of 4:06 persons to each house, were mud walled, grass or palm-leaf thatched huts. Of the twenty villages, two had a population of less than 200 souls, six had from 200 to 500, six from 500 to 1000, four from 1000 to 2000, and two from 2000 to 5000. Except deep-sea fishers, sailors, and tile turners, who sometimes leave their homes for as long as eight months at a time, the whole of the Sachin people is stationary.\n\nThe soil is in some places black, and in others light. The number of ponds and wells, of which there is a good supply, is being yearly increased. The chief crops are rice, dangar, Oryza sativa; millet, bajri, Pennicillaria spicata; Indian millet, jowar, Sorghum vulgare; wheat, ghau, Triticum aestivum; tuver, Cajanus indicus; mag, Phaseolus radiatus; sugarcane, serdi, Saccharum officinarum; and cotton, kapas, Gossypium herbaceum. The tillage is the same as in the neighbouring British and Gaikwar villages.\n\n1 From materials supplied by Mr. E. C. K. Ollivant, Assistant Collector in charge of Sachin.\n2 In 1878 a sum of \u00a3456 (Rs. 4560) was spent in building and repairing wells and ponds.\nA lately built breakwater at Dumas and a causeway at Bhimpur, by keeping out the tidal water, prepare the way for making culturable a large area of salt land.\n\nThe business of money-lending is almost entirely in the hands of grain-dealers, as a rule M\u00e1rv\u00e1di Shr\u00e1vaks. Formerly most state demands were payable in Broach rupees; but the British is the only currency now recognised. Except labourers employed by the state, whose daily wages in the lifetime of the late Naw\u00e1b were 3d. (2 annas) for a man, 2\u00bdd. (1\u00bd annas) for a woman, and 1\u00bdd. (1 anna) for a boy, the same prices and wages prevail as in the neighbouring British villages. The weights and measures are the same as in Surat.\n\nUp to the death of the late Naw\u00e1b (1873), except three miles between Bhimpur and Gaviar on the way to Surat, there were no made roads. Since 1873, bridged and metalled roads have been made from the Bhimpur road to Dumas \u00bc mile, from Sachin to the railway station three-quarters of a mile, and from Sachin to L\u00e1chpor on the Mindhola river two miles. The Sachin section of the Sachin and Surat road is now under construction. A bridge over the tidal creek at the village of Udna was completed in 1877-78 at a cost of \u00a31635 12s. (Rs. 16,356), and in 1877-78 a rest-house was built at Sachin.\n\nThere are three ferries on the Mindhola river between Sachin and the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s Maroli sub-division.\n\nThere is one post-office in the town of Sachin, under the management of the British post department.\n\nThe Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway runs through about seven miles of the state. The average traffic at the Sachin station, during the five years ending 1877, was, of passengers 22,988, and of goods 1672 tons.\n\nThe hand-loom weaving of cotton cloth is carried on in one or two villages, chiefly in Kotha, whose cloth, woven by Musalm\u00e1n T\u00e1is, is held in high local esteem. Near Sachin station is a steam cotton ginning and pressing factory.\n\nThe Naw\u00e1b of Sachin is of African descent. When his ancestors came to India is doubtful. During the fifteenth century, under the name of the Sidis of Danda-R\u00e1japur and Janjira in the Konkan, they were known, first as the Bij\u00e1pur (1489-1686), and afterwards as the Moghal, admirals. Under Bij\u00e1pur, their fleet guarded commerce and carried pilgrims to Mecca, and, in 1660, on receiving a yearly grant of \u00a330,000 (Rs. 3,00,000) from the Surat revenues, they became Aurangzeb\u2019s admirals. In the eighteenth\n\n---\n\n1 In 1878, \u00a32069 (Rs. 20,690) were spent on road repairs.\n2 The details are: 1873, passengers 20,318, goods 1483 tons; 1874, passengers 24,448, goods 1228 tons; 1875, passengers 23,142, goods 1419 tons; 1876, passengers 23,143, goods 1900 tons; and 1877, passengers 23,590, goods 2329 tons.\n3 In western India Habsi includes not only Abyssinians but Africans from the Somali coast.\ncentury on the decline of Moghal power, the Janjira Sidis became notorious pirates, plundering the ships of all nations except the English, whose friendship they cultivated.\\(^1\\) During the early years of the eighteenth century, the Sidis were at constant war with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and, though the Peshwa succeeded (1736-37) in annexing the greater part of their lands, he failed, in spite of yearly expeditions, to take their island fort.\\(^2\\) In 1762, to the exclusion of Abdul Rahim the rightful heir, Sidi Y\u00e1kut succeeded at Janjira. Helped by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Abdul Rahim, though defeated and a fugitive, was so formidable a rival, that Sidi Y\u00e1kut compromised the dispute by promising that, on his death, Abdul Rahim should succeed to Danda-Raj\u00e1pur and Janjira. Under this agreement Abdul Rahim succeeded in 1772, and continued to rule till his death in 1784. On Abdul Rahim's death, to the exclusion of his eldest son Abdul Karim Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n commonly called B\u00e1lu Mia, Sidi Johar, commandant of Janjira seized the chiefship.\\(^3\\) B\u00e1lu Mia fled to Poona. His cause was strongly supported by N\u00e1na Phadnavis, who was anxious by some means to gain power over the unconquerable island of Janjira. Johar appealed to the English to settle the dispute, declaring that he would fight as long as he had one man left and the rock of Janjira remained. Efforts were made to prevent the outbreak of war, and, on his making over his claims on Janjira to the Peshwa, Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n or B\u00e1lu Mia was guaranteed a tract of land near Surat estimated to yield \u00a37500 (Rs. 75,000) a year.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe first instalment of the grant consisted of seventeen detached villages in the Chor\u00e1si sub-division known as the sattarg\u00e1m pargana. As it was found that the territory, then granted, did not yield the promised revenue, an addition was made of three P\u00e1rchol villages now part of Jal\u00e1lpur. But as the Peshwa never succeeded in reducing Janjira, no farther grant of territory was made. B\u00e1lu Mia arrived at Surat, and, after a short residence there, proceeded to the small fort of Sachin, which he had chosen as his head-quarters. Shortly after on paying the Emperor Sh\u00e1h \u00c1lam II. a fee, nazar\u00e1na, he received the title of Naw\u00e1b. He afterwards changed his residence to L\u00e1chpor, and, dying in 1802, was succeeded by his son Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Muhammad Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n. In 1816 an attempt was made to induce the Naw\u00e1b to transfer to the British, criminal and civil jurisdiction in his villages. But as the concessions offered were not considered sufficient, the negotiations fell to the ground. His extravagant habits plunged the Naw\u00e1b into money difficulties, and in 1833 an inquiry, made by the British Government, showed\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In a treaty with the Sidis, the British Government, in 1733, pledged itself to perpetual alliance and sincere friendship.\n\n\\(^2\\) In 1736-37 the Peshwa acquired half the revenues of eleven mah\u00e1ls in the Habshi's territory. During their ascendancy, every year between 1682 and 1736 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s attacked Janjira, but, having to leave during the rainy season, always failed to take the island.\n\n\\(^3\\) Sidi Y\u00e1kut had made a will bequeathing the principality to the second son of Abdul Rahim at his father's death, under the guardianship, in case of a minority, of his own friend Sidi Johar. Grant Duff's History, (Bom. Ed.) 507.\n\n\\(^4\\) Aitchison's Treaties (1876), IV. 315, CXXIII.\nclaims against his estate amounting altogether to \u00a3132,823 10s. (Rs. 13,28,235). At his request the British Government agreed to effect a settlement. In 1835\\(^1\\) the debt was guaranteed; and all the villages, except Sachin and L\u00e1chpor, were attached and the country managed by the District Judge then Agent at Surat; and, after setting apart \u00a31800 (Rs. 18,000) a year for the maintenance of the Naw\u00e1b, the balance, about \u00a36700 (Rs. 67,000), was spent in paying off the debt.\\(^2\\) Dying in 1853, the Naw\u00e1b was succeeded by his son Sidi Abdul Karim Kh\u00e1n. In 1859,\\(^3\\) when \u00a378,581 (Rs. 7,85,810) of the debt had been paid, the attachment was withdrawn, and, as the revenue had fallen to \u00a37891 (Rs. 78,910), Government agreed to hand over the whole estate to the Naw\u00e1b, on his promising to pay, every year before the first of June, a sum of \u00a33500 (Rs. 35,000), until the outstanding sum of \u00a354,242 (Rs. 5,42,420) should be cleared off. In 1859 the Naw\u00e1b received a patent, sanad, guaranteeing the succession of his state according to Musalm\u00e1n law. Till his death in December 1868, he regularly paid the yearly sum of \u00a33500 (Rs. 35,000). He was succeeded by his son Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Muhammad Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n, who died in 1873 leaving a son Abdul K\u00e1dar, the present chief, then a boy of nine years. Since 1873 the state has been managed by an assistant to the Political Agent of Surat, and, by regular yearly instalments, the whole of the debt was cleared off in 1877.\n\nThe following is the Sachin family tree:\n\n(I.) Abdul Karim Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n (commonly known as B\u00e1lu Mia)\n(died 1802).\n\n(II.) Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n\n(died 1853).\n\n(III.) Abdul Karim Kh\u00e1n\n(died 1868).\n\n(IV.) Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Muhammad Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n\n(died 1873).\n\n(V.) Abdul K\u00e1dar\n(the present Chief).\n\nThe chief is entitled to a salute of nine guns, and has power to try all offences committed by the people of his state. He maintains a force of sixty-two men. In point of succession the family follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nThe state lands are tilled on the holding, kh\u00e1t\u00e1bandi, system. In theory, possession depends on the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s pleasure; in practice, a holder cannot be ousted unless he fails to pay the assessment. Holdings can be transferred only with the chief\u2019s sanction and on\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This and not 1829 (Aitchison\u2019s Treaties, IV. 311) seems to have been the date of the attachment.\n\n\\(^2\\) The terms of the agreement are given in Aitchison\u2019s Treaties (1876), IV. 316.\n\n\\(^3\\) This and not 1864 (Aitchison\u2019s Treaties, IV. 311) seems to be the correct date.\nthe payment of a fee, *nazar\u00e1na*, varying from five per cent of the assessment in the case of direct male succession, to twenty per cent on a transfer to an outsider.\\(^1\\)\n\nArable waste taken for tillage pays a fee, *nazar\u00e1na*, of about twenty per cent on the first year's assessment. Neither land nor field tools are liable to be sold for private debts. In all the villages the land assessment is paid in money, and generally speaking the fields are tilled by the persons in whose names they stand. Of 26,814 acres the total area, 23,604 belong to the state, and 3210 are alienated. Of the state land 63,921 acres are unarable. Of the arable area 15,649 acres are occupied and 1563 acres waste. On the occupied arable land the assessment averages 16s. 3d. (Rs. 8 as. 2) an acre, compared with 18s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 6 as. 11) including the local fund cess, in the neighbouring British villages. The acre rates, on land able to yield sugarcane and similar crops, vary from \u00a32 6s. to \u00a33 (Rs. 23-30), on rice land from \u00a31 1s. to \u00a32 18s. (Rs. 10\u00bd-29), and on ordinary dry crop land from 4s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 2-15). The revenue is collected in two villages in two instalments, December and February, and in the rest in three instalments, December, February, and April. The process for the recovery of arrears is the same as in British villages. Billets, *mohsals*, are seldom resorted to. Remissions are granted in cases of damage by fire or flood, of extreme poverty, or in specially bad seasons.\n\nCivil and criminal authority rests with the Naw\u00e1b and his officers. Formerly to settle questions of usage, caste heads and councils, *panch\u00e1yats*, and in fiscal matters village headmen and other hereditary revenue officers, were consulted by the Naw\u00e1b. In cases decided by the Naw\u00e1b, the statements of witnesses were taken in writing by the court clerks, and were then read over to the Naw\u00e1b in the Darb\u00e1r room, usually in the absence of the parties. In civil suits a commission of ten per cent on the amount at issue was paid by the plaintiff in advance, and recovered from the defendant if the plaintiff gained the suit. Process fees were also levied at rates varying from 3d. to 4s. (*annas* 2 - Rs. 2). In criminal cases, the usual punishment was, in the lighter offences, fine, and in the more heinous, imprisonment. On the complainant paying a fee of 2s. (Re. 1) petty offences might be compromised. During the minority of the present Naw\u00e1b, British codes and acts have been introduced, and the following courts established. The court of the minister, *diw\u00e1n*, with jurisdiction in civil suits up to \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000); of the sub-divisional magistrate, *tahsild\u00e1r*, with the powers of a second class magistrate; of the Assistant Agent in charge of the state with, in criminal matters, the powers of a district magistrate and assistant judge, and in civil cases the powers of an assistant judge; and of the Agent to the Governor with the powers of a District and Sessions Judge, Government exercising the powers of the High Court. In\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The details are: direct male descent, 5 per cent; direct female descent, 10 per cent; collateral succession, 10 per cent; transfer, 20 per cent.\n1878-79, 306 civil, 126 criminal, and three appeal cases were disposed of. Registration is practised, and fees levied according to the following scale: on deeds of sale and mortgage bonds, a five and four per cent fee; on wills and adoption deeds, a fixed fee of 10s. (Rs. 5); and on all other deeds, a fixed fee of 8s. (Rs. 4). From the Kolis of Dumas a divorce fee of \u00a35 (Rs. 50) is levied, and a fee of 2s. 6d. (Re. 1\u00bd) on applications for the restitution of conjugal rights. A fee of 2s. (Re. 1) is also charged on powers of attorney, petitions of appeal, sealing decrees, and withdrawing from, or compromising, suits. A fee of 1s. (annas 8) is charged on agreements and security bonds. On ordinary petitions the fee is 1\u00bdd. (anna 1).\n\nMost villages have a police as well as a revenue head whose emoluments are fixed. The other village servants combine revenue and police duties. The chief of them, the village messenger, hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r, is paid at 8s. (Rs. 4) a month; the rest, from one to five in number, of the Dubla or Dheda cast, enjoy rent-free plots of land. At the head of the police is a chief constable, faujid\u00e1r, whose headquarters are at Sachin, and who has the control of the troops, sibandi, 64 in number, 24 Arabs, 17 mounted, and 23 foot police. The Arabs, the armed police of the state, are directly under a jam\u00edd\u00e1r, an Arab of some importance, who supplies the contingents in Dharampur, B\u00e1sda, and Sachin. The mounted police and constables, though ordinarily employed on revenue or escort duties, are available for police purposes. Occasionally proprietors, gir\u00e1s\u00edas, are called on to supply police guards at the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s residence.\n\nDuring the forty-three years ending 1879, the gross yearly revenue has risen from \u00a39500 to \u00a318,956 (Rs. 95,000 - 1,89,560). After paying the last of the debt, and with outstanding liabilities amounting to only \u00a31067 (Rs. 10,670), there remained on the 31st July 1878 a balance of \u00a314,396 (Rs. 1,43,960).\n\nAs a source of revenue spirits come next to land. This, as in the Surat district, consists of the amount bid by village tavern-keepers at a public auction for the right to make and sell spirits and palm juice, t\u0101d\u012b.\n\nUnder the head cesses, the chief items are: on the cotton press and ginning yards, from \u00a31 to \u00a35; on the village shepherds, from \u00a31 10s. to \u00a36; on the tanners, 6s. to \u00a32-6; on each grain dealer and money-lender, 6s. to \u00a35; on each goldsmith, 4s. to 12s.; on each weaver, 4s. to 8s.; on each butcher, 10s.; on each cotton cleaner, 2s. to 12s.; on each oil-seller, 4s. to 8s.; and on each fisherman and sea-coast Koli, 2s. to 10s. There is also a duty of 7\u00bd pounds on every cart-load of 1200 pounds (30 Surat mans) of grain imported into Dumas. The right to levy this duty,\n\n---\n\n1 The details are: hurt 29, wrongful restraint 4, insult and petty assault 19, mischief 30, house-trespass 1, theft 30, criminal breach of trust 3, cattle pound offences 6, and excise 4; total, 126.\n\n2 Besides the poll cess, the Dumas, Bhimpur, and Gaviar fishers pay on each stake net, gohva, \u00a31 10s.; on each drag net, lodh, 1s.; on each marriage, 10\u00bdd.; and on each re-marriage, 5s.\nas well as the right of selling copper and brass vessels is put to auction, and brings, on an average, from \u00a32.10 to \u00a33 (Rs. 25-30). A yearly sum of \u00a31 5s. (Rs. 12\u00bd) is levied from the Dumas shopkeepers in consideration of their having the sole right of buying the thread spun by the fishermen. Under the head of cesses comes the right to levy what is known as the Dumas choki dues. This right is at present farmed for a yearly sum of \u00a3201 14s. (Rs. 2017). The dues consist of an additional twenty-five per cent on the cesses on fishermen and sea coast Kolis, on stake and drag nets, and on the masters of ships. This right, which formerly belonged to the British Government,\u00b9 was made over to the Naw\u00e1b in 1865, upon his undertaking to pay a fixed yearly sum of \u00a3170 (Rs. 1700). The state draws no revenue from customs or transit dues. Tolls are taken at two places, one on the Sachin and Surat road for the repairs of a bridge over a tidal creek, the other at the ferry at the mouth of the Mindhola river between Bhimpur and the Ga\u00edkwar village of D\u00e1nti.\n\nUnder this head come the crown dues, nazar\u00e1n\u00e1s, payments made by state servants and others in public assembly on the Dasera, the Moharam, and the Ramz\u00e1n and Bakri Ids. Village headmen and accountants pay 4s. and 3s. (Rs. 2 and 1\u00bd) respectively. Besides these items certain original dues, m\u00e1muli haks, of sheep, dried fish, rope, thread, vegetables, and earthen vessels, worth about \u00a350 (Rs. 500) a year, are levied in kind.\n\nAccording to the 1872 census, of 14,678 the total Hindu population, 1184 or 8\u00b706 per cent; of 2272 the total Musalm\u00e1n population, 122 (males 119, females 3) or 5\u00b73 per cent; and of 153 the total P\u00e1rsi population, 38 (males 30, females 8) or 24\u00b78 per cent, were able to read and write or were being taught. Within the last four years the number of schools and pupils has much increased. There are (1879), under the education department, five schools maintained at a yearly cost of \u00a3113 (Rs. 1130), with an average attendance of 176 pupils, and two private grant-in-aid schools.\n\nThe dispensary, opened in 1878, was, in that year, at a cost of \u00a393 (Rs. 930) attended by 1775 cut-door and three in-door patients. Of the cut-door patients 1728 were cured, one died, ten left, and ten were under treatment at the close of the year. The chief diseases were malarious fever, liver, and skin affections. In 1878, 409 persons were vaccinated.\n\nBhimpur, a village of 2772 souls on the sea-coast near the mouth of the T\u00e1pti, has a small temple dedicated to Hanum\u00e1n. On the 14th of the first half of Bh\u00e1drapad (September-October) a yearly fair is held in honour of the god, when people from Surat throng in numbers.\n\n\u00b9 It is hard to say how the British Government came to have this right. The present Sachin villages in the Chorasi sub-division belonged to the Ga\u00edkwar, who granted them to Sakhar\u00e1m B\u00e1pu from whom they passed into the Peshwa's hands. Whether the Dumas choki dues ever belonged to the Peshwa, or whether they passed direct to the British as an appurtenance of the port and city of Surat, or were acquired by them through the Ga\u00edkwar, is doubtful.\nDumas, a village of 4531 souls, a mile from Bhimpur, with some good houses, excellent water, and a cool climate, is, during the hot season, a favourite resort for the European residents of Surat. It has a school-house, with room for 200 children, built in 1878 at a cost of \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000).\n\nSachin, a small village of 722 souls, has, besides the Naw\u00e1b's palace and a garden, a school, a dispensary, and a post office.\nINDEX.\n\nA.\n\nAbyssinian Agate Workers : 206, note 3.\n\u00c1ga : Rashid Beg, minister (1766), 228.\nAgar : state, 142.\nAgates : R.
