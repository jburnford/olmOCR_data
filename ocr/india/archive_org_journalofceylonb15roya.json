White, C.C.S.\n(2) \"On a Curious Nematoid Parasite from the Stomach of a Ceylon Insect (Mantis religiosa),\" by O. Collett, F.R.M.S.\n(3) \"How the last King of Kandy was captured by the British,\" by T. B.

C. P. Bell, C.C.S., Archaeological Commissioner.\n\nMembers.\n\nDuring the past year ten new Members were elected, viz., C. Muttiah; Dr. J. S. Johnpulle; Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my Srikantha; C. Namasivagam; D. J. Arsecularatne; L. Walker, M.A.; G. W. Bibile; E. S. D. Tillekeratne; J. E. D. Silva; and G. C. Trask.\n\nFive Members resigned, viz., G. Grenier; C. O. Mackwood; H. Nevill, C.C.S.; Hon. F. R. Saunders, C.M.G., C.C.S.; and A. Thomson.\n\nThe following names of Members were removed from the roll for not conforming to No. 30 of the Society's Rules, viz.:\u2014J. D. Casinader, F. W. de Silva, W. H. Dias, N. A. W. Jayawardena, N. Mendis, A. H. Monarasingha, R. O. S. Morgan, and S. Visuvalingapillai.\n\nThe Hon. L. F. Lee has rejoined the Society as a Life Member.\n\nMr. A. Haly, the Director of the Colombo Museum, was elected an Honorary Member in recognition of services rendered by him, and in virtue of his official position as Director of the Colombo Museum.\n\nBy the death of Dr. H. Trimen the Society has lost one of its most distinguished Members. Dr. Trimen was born in London in 1843 and educated at King's College. He studied medicine, and in 1865 graduated M.B., but he never practised his profession. In 1867 he was appointed Lecturer on Botany at St. Mary's Hospital, and in 1869 entered the Botanical Department of the British Museum as a Senior Assistant. He remained in the Museum till 1879, when he accepted the post of Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Ceylon. His first published work appeared in the *Phytologist* in 1862. In 1869, jointly with Mr. W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, the present Director of the Kew Gardens, he brought out a work on the \"Flora of Middlesex,\" which still holds a position in the first rank among county \"Floras.\" In 1866 Dr. Trimen discovered *Wolffia arrhiza* at Staines, the first locality recorded for it in England. In 1870 he joined Dr. B. Seeman in editing the Journal of Botany, and was sole editor from 1872 to 1879. In 1880 he associated himself with Professor Bently in the publication of an illustrated work in four volumes on \"Medicinal Plants.\" Dr. Trimen's great work is his \"Handbook to the Flora of Ceylon,\" three volumes of which have been published, while the fourth and last has been left unfinished. To the *Encyclopaedia Britannica* he contributed a Paper on Grasses. Dr. Trimen was a Fellow of the Linnaean Society, and in 1883 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He joined this Society in 1880, and was for several years a Member of Council. He always took an active interest in the Society's affairs and contributed the following valuable Papers to its Journal:\n\n(i.) \"A Systematic Catalogue of the Flowering Plants and Ferns Indigenous to, or growing wild in, Ceylon, with the Vernacular names and with reference to Thwaites' *Enumeratio*;\" published in Journal, Vol. IX., No. 30, 1885.\n\n(ii.) \"Remarks on the Composition, Geographical Affinities, and Origin of the Ceylon Flora;\" published in Journal, Vol. IX., No. 31, 1885.\n\n(iii.) \"Note on the Botany of Ri\u1e6di-gala;\" published in Journal, Vol. XI., No. 31, 1889.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe additions to the Library during the year numbered 278 volumes. The acquisitions are chiefly exchanges received from other Societies. The Library is indebted for donations to the following:\u2014The Government of Bengal, the Secretary of State in Council for India, United States Department of Agriculture, the Ceylon Government, the Director of Public Instruction, the Government of India, the Government of Bombay, the Government of Punjab, Calcutta Sanskrit College, the Government of Madras, Harward University, the Government of Queensland, the Government of North-West Provinces and Oudh, and to Messrs. D. W. Ferguson, G. A. Joseph, and Dr. H. Trimen.\n\nAdditional shelf accommodation has been provided, by which the books have been rendered more accessible and the congested state of the Library relieved to some extent. Some of the books stored away in cupboards can now be conveniently consulted. The want of space for books, referred to in previous Reports, is still a most pressing question, and seriously interferes with the proper administration and development of the Library. No adequate remedy for this state of things can be expected until additional space has been procured by the long-delayed extension of the Museum building.\n\nJOURNALS.\n\nOne number of the Society's Journal has been published during the year (Vol. XIV., No. 46, 1895), which contains, in addition to the Proceedings of the Council and General Meetings, the following Papers:\n\n(i.) \"Gleanings from Ancient Tamil Literature,\" by the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.\n(ii.) \"King Senkuttuvan of the Chera Dynasty,\" by the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.\n(iii.) \"Interim Report on the Operations of the Archaeological Survey at Sigiriya in 1895,\" by H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S., Archaeological Commissioner.\n(iv.) \"A Sketch of the Early History of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\" by the Lord Bishop of Colombo, President.\n\nThe Journal for 1896 is ready, and an advance copy is laid on the table.\n\nARCH\u00c6OLOGY.\n\nThe Archaeological Commissioner favours the Council with the following synopsis of the work done by the Archaeological Survey in 1896:\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe Archaeological Vote for last year was Rs. 35,000\u2014covering Salaries of the whole staff, Transport, Labour, and Miscellaneous charges (grants to other Provinces, photography, epigraphical work, &c.).\n\nWith this sum the Archaeological Commissioner was enabled to push on operations at Sigiriya (Central Province) vigorously for a second season, and to further continue the hunt for ancient sites and inscriptions in the North-Central Province.\n\nBut at Anur\u00e1dhapura itself steady advance in excavating the vast ruin-strewn area still untouched has unfortunately been again retarded\nby limited means. In November and December\u2014wet months best suited for digging\u2014all excavation had to be suspended from sheer want of money.\n\nSimilarly, in the epigraphical branch, beyond adding considerably to the already large stock of inscriptions copied, and suitable for publication, the Archaeological Commissioner found himself powerless to start the issue of that most desirable work\u2014a standard \"Epigraphia Zeylanica.\"\n\nSigiriya.\n\nThe Archaeological Commissioner's \"Interim Report on the Operations of the Archaeological Survey at Sigiriya (Second Season), 1896,\" has recently been read at a General Meeting of this Society.\n\nAt Sigiriya some four months' work has resulted in decided progress. Almost the entire site of the ancient nuvara, or city, has been swept of undergrowth and carefully surveyed. On the summit of the Rock fully half of the interesting citadel (with its terraces, stairs, walls, tanks, &c.) is now laid bare, and its general plan well disclosed.\n\nBelow, the difficulty of gaining access into the two fresco \"pockets,\" in the west scarp overhanging the \"gallery,\" has been finally surmounted; and of the twenty-two frescoes left on Sigiri-gala, six have already been accurately copied in oils by Mr. D. A. L. Perera, Head Draughtsman, Archaeological Survey.\n\nWork is about to re-commence at Sigiriya for the third season.\n\nK\u00e9galla District.\n\nIn 1895 a grant of Rs. 500 was sanctioned by Government for the restoration of the basement of that unique ruin Berendi K\u00f3vil, near Avisawella. Last year, a further sum of Rs. 600 was allowed for rebuilding the ornamental wall of the terrace on which the shrine stands.\n\nThe Assistant Government Agent, K\u00e9galla, reports that the work has been most effectively carried out, from first to last, by Mr. Mayes, District Engineer.\n\nAnur\u00e1dhapura.\n\n(a) Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma.\u2014The whole of the buildings within the outer boundary have now been excavated, and the quadrangular wall line exposed along its full extent. The ruined site immediately west of the D\u00e1gaba (sometimes termed \"Mihindu's Tomb,\" and partially excavated by Mr. J. G. Smith twenty years ago) has been dug up, afresh, and more fully. The pirivena, outhouses, &c., are being followed, in order to ascertain, as far as possible, the complete original plan of the Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma Monastery premises. Further, the sloping bank of d\u00e9bris which hid the other half (not excavated in 1895) of the high wall encircling the raised m\u00e1lawa, or platform, of Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma D\u00e1gaba, was completely removed. The appearance of this most picturesque st\u00fapa has thereby been greatly enhanced.\n\n(b) Mulla-gala Ruins.\u2014A party was detached to excavate a small block of ruins, lying in thick jungle, half way between the Jaffna road and the Malwatu-oya, and some three miles out of the town. This little monastery, complete in itself, is evidently very ancient. The style of the buildings\u2014not more than half a dozen in all\u2014recalls those at Riti-gala in plain simplicity of stonework. The pilima-g\u00e9 (image-house) at the back was strikingly perched on a rocky knoll, mounted by three or four flights of steps.\n(c) Puliyankulam Monastery.\u2014The same party next commenced excavating the extensive monastery bordering the Jaffna road at the junction with \u201cMacBride\u2019s Deviation.\u201d So far, only three of the four shrines of the inner enclosure, and two or three buildings outside, have been finished. This monastery, though larger, so closely resembles \u201cVijayarama\u201d that it probably belongs to the same period.\n\n(d) Elala Sohona.\u2014The examination of the tree-covered hillock, popularly known as \u201cElala\u2019s Tomb,\u201d situated a few hundred yards south of the sacred Bo-tree, and adjoining the Kurunegala road, has at last been undertaken. The identification of this site is one of the chief problems connected with the ancient city remaining to be solved.\n\nTwo broad trenches are being run into the circular mound on the east and north sides. As soon as the plinth of the structure is reached the two gangs will turn respectively north and eastwards until they meet. Subsequent action must depend on the experience gained at this quadrant.\n\nCircuit Work.\n\nAugust and September were devoted to the thorough exploration of the Vilachchiya Koral\u00e9, the wildest part of the North-Central Province. The greater portion of this huge Koral\u00e9 is virtually terra incognita and quite uninhabited, save when overrun during the dry season by gangs of Moors from the west coast, illicitly bent on the wholesale extermination of game. Magnificent tanks, such as Mah\u00e1, and Kuda, Vilachchiya, long breached and abandoned, testify to the ancient prosperity of this part of the Island, now cursed by want of water. Archaeologically, the Vilachchiya Koral\u00e9 is comparatively barren; though more antiquities will undoubtedly come to light when this neglected division becomes once more peopled.\n\nLeaving the Puttalam road on the 24th of August, and moving with baggage-coolies, the expedition traversed the almost unknown Galg\u00e9 Wanni, Moragalla Wanni, Vil Pattuwa (\u201clake district\u201d), Vilachchi Wanni, and the Pichchampattu Tulana, emerging finally at the Mannar road\u2014having struck but one village in the five weeks\u2019 march between August 31 and October 4!\n\nThe interminable katu-pat, or thorn jungles, the narrow tracks in hot, deep sand, and the exceeding scarcity of water, rendered this circuit the most trying yet accomplished by the Archaeological Survey.\n\nThree or four days were given to Tantri-malai\u2014by far the most interesting site in the Vilachchiya Koral\u00e9. The beautifully carved colossal images of Buddha (seated and prone), rock-hewn as at the Gal-vihare, Polonnaruwa, were freed of jungle, and the d\u00e9bris partially excavated.\n\nA varied and extensive set of photographs were secured during the tour.\n\nWith this circuit the Archaeological Survey has completed\u2014a few places worthy of a second visit excepted\u2014the exploration of all the seventeen Koral\u00e9s forming \u201cNuwarakalawiya\u201d (i.e., the whole of the vast North-Central Province, Tammankaduwa excluded), or an extent of country covering approximately 3,000 square miles.\n\nTammankaduwa will be examined in 1897.\nEpigraphical.\n\nDrs. Goldsmidt and M\u00fcller record five or six inscriptions in all from the Vilachchiya K\u00f3ral\u00e9. These were re-copied and photographed where possible; and several other hitherto unnoticed rock and pillar inscriptions added to the list.\n\nOfficers.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor has accepted the office of Patron of the Society. Mr. F. Lewis was appointed in September Acting Honorary Treasurer in place of Mr. F. C. Roles, who left for Europe. Messrs. F. H. Price and C. M. Fernando were elected Members of Council in place of Messrs. J. P. Lewis and A. P. Green, who retired from the Council under Rule 16.\n\nFinances.\n\nThe following is a statement of the income and expenditure of the Society for 1896:\n\nReceipts.\n\n| Description                  | Rs.  | c.   |\n|------------------------------|------|------|\n| Balance, General Account     |      | 125 38 |\n| Entrance Fees                |      | 52 50 |\n\nMembers' Subscriptions, 1891\n\n| Year | Rs.  | c.   |\n|------|------|------|\n| 1891 | 10   | 50   |\n| 1892 | 21   | 0    |\n| 1893 | 84   | 0    |\n| 1894 | 257  | 25   |\n| 1895 | 357  | 0    |\n| 1896 | 1,371| 50   |\n| 1897 | 5    | 25   |\n\nLife Members\n\n| Description                  | Rs.  | c.   |\n|------------------------------|------|------|\n|                              |      | 140 50 |\n\nTotal ... 2,424 88\n\nExpenditure.\n\n| Description                          | Rs.  | c.   |\n|--------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Printing                             |      | 587 68 |\n| Charges                              |      | 872 92 |\n| Books                                |      | 6    |\n| Conversazione account, closing items |      | 42 46 |\n\nBalance (Bank of Madras)\n\n| Description                  | Rs.  | c.   |\n|------------------------------|------|------|\n|                              |      | 915 82 |\n\nTotal ... 2,424 88\n\nExamined and found correct: F.

Haly read the following Paper:\u2014\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO CEYLON MALACOLOGY.*\n\n(1) The Terrestrial Mollusca of Ambagamuwa.\n\nBy O. Collett, F.R.M.S., Cor. Member of the Malacological Society of London, &c.\n\nThe following observations are offered on a collection of Mollusca made during the last two years in the district of Ambagamuwa (Central Province).\n\nThis district is situated in the heart of the wet region of the Island. It ranges from 2,000 ft. to 4,000 ft. in altitude, and has an average annual rainfall of 190 in.\n\nThe extent of my researches has been limited, owing to the nature of my professional duties.\n\nThis Paper, therefore, is only to be looked upon as a preliminary account of the inquiry. I hope in time to bring out a complete list of the land-shells that are to be found in this district, giving, in as many instances as possible, particulars of the habits, instincts, times of breeding, &c., of the different species. In the difficult task of identifying the species here enumerated, I have received much kind assistance from Dr. F. Jousseaume, the celebrated Zoologist of Paris, to whom I take this opportunity of expressing my grateful thanks. I have also derived much useful information from the Paper which Dr. F. Jousseaume has written on Ceylon shells,\u2020 and which is quite indispensable to collectors.\n\nFAM. HELICID\u00c6.\n\n1.\u2014Helix (Fruticicola) similaris, F\u00e9\u00e9r.\n\nThis species is abundant in the district, and appears to be widely distributed. It occurs in thick scrub and lantana,\n\n* To illustrate the Paper two cases of land shells were exhibited, containing the shells described by Mr. Collett, and presented by him to the Colombo Museum.\n\n\u2020 Mollusques recueillis \u00e0 Ceylon par M. E. Simon, et revision g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des especes terrestres et flurio-lacustres de cette Ile. (M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Zoologique de France, 1894, pp. 264\u2013330.)\nand also upon stone walls, especially where the masonry is new. The shells are very variable in colour and markings, some being pure white, while others are dark reddish-brown. In some instances they are unicolorous; but as a rule they are banded with a single line, which is much darker than the general colouring of the shell. The animal, which is gray and white, gives a speckled appearance to the semi-transparent shell. It is oviparous in April\u2013September. The eggs are of about the size of grains of sago, globular in shape, bluish-white, and calcareous.\n\n2.\u2014*Helix acuducta*, Benson.\n\nI have found a few specimens of this distinctly Indian form in Ambagamuwa. It has not previously been recorded from Ceylon. It occurs in low thickets and dense scrub in damp localities. Young specimens are not rare, but full-grown shells are seldom seen\u2014probably the animals are much preyed upon by birds. Hitherto regarded as a Nilgherries species (*Conchologia Indica*, pl. l., f. 5).\n\n3.\u2014*Hemiplecta hyphasma*, Pfr.\n\nThis pretty little species is abundant among ferns and grass, and on mossy banks, throughout the district. It has a semi-transparent shell, through which the black and white markings of the animal are visible.\n\n4.\u2014*H. cingalensis*, Bens.\n\nI have taken a few specimens of this species from beneath the bark of a decaying tree in a clearing\u2014kindly identified by Dr. Jousseaume. I have never found a mature shell. It appears to be rare in this district.\n\n5.\u2014*H. chenui*, Pfr.\n\nThis species is fairly common throughout the district. It closely resembles the South India form *H. chenui* (*Conchologia Indica*, pl. xxv., f.1), with which it is in all probability identical. The animal is dirty white, marked with longitudinal gray bands; it is very slimy, and makes a peculiar squeaking noise, like a beetle, when molested. It is oviparous\nin May-August. The eggs are 8 mm. long and 4 mm. in width. They are oval, pointed at the ends, and carinated longitudinally; they are pure white in colour and quite soft (uncalcified).\n\nHabitat amongst decaying vegetation. Young animals are of a brick-red colour, visible through their translucent shells.\n\n6.\u2014*H. ceylanica*, Pfr.\n\nThis species is abundant in Lower Ambagamuwa, but it is not found in the upper part of the district.\n\nHabitat among fallen leaves in damp shady localities; 2,000 ft.\n\n7.\u2014*H. semidecussata*, Pfr.\n\nI have found this species fairly common throughout the district. It occurs among fallen leaves in forest and scrub, and is much preyed upon by birds, with whom it appears to be a favourite food. I have occasionally come across a sacrificial stone in the jungle surrounded by heaps of broken shells. When alive the animal, which is mottled black and white, gives a handsome \"checked\" appearance to the reddish-brown translucent shell. The body whorl of young specimens is acutely angular.\n\nAccording to the *Conchologia Indica* this is essentially identical with the Mauritian species.\n\n8.\u2014*Ernstia aspirans*, Blanf.\n\nThis species usually appears in very wet weather. I have then often found it on the trunks of orange trees in bungalow gardens. Height 3\u00b733 mm., diameter 3 mm.\n\n9.\u2014*Microcystis suavis*, Jouss.\n\nThis species occurs sparingly here. The animal, when alive, gives a dark olive tint to the transparent shell.\n\nHabitat among ferns and moss in shady localities. Height 2\u00b750 mm., diameter 4 mm.\n\n10.\u2014*M. Thwaitesii*, Pfr.\n\nI have only found a few of this species in the district. One of them Dr. Jousseaume describes as an unusually large and\nbeautiful specimen. It has the same habitat as the last species.\n\nHeight 3\u00b750 mm., diameter 6 mm. (largest specimen).\n\n11.\u2014Macrochlamys partita, Pfr.\n\nThis is one of our commonest species. It is rather variable in size and in depth of colour. The animal, which is black and white, is dimly visible through the shell.\n\nHabitat amongst leaf mould around the roots of plants.\n\n12.\u2014M. politissima, Pfr.\n\nThis species is fairly common throughout the district, but perfect specimens are scarce on account of the brittle nature of the shells. The animal, which can only partially retreat into its shell, is bluish-black with dark gray tentacula.\n\nHabitat among thickets and scrub in ravines and swampy places.\n\n13.\u2014M. carneola, Pfr.\n\nI have taken one specimen only of this species from among ferns in a swamp (3,000 ft.).\n\n14.\u2014Corilla erronea, Albers.\n\nThis species is fairly common throughout the district. The shells are very variable in size, shape, and colouration, some specimens being almost black. The animal is dirty white, its dorsal surface dusted with grayish granules.\n\nHabitat in heavy forest among fallen leaves.\n\n15.\u2014C. fry\u00e6, Gude.\n\nThis is very similar to the last species. Mr. Gude has made a new species of it on account of a slightly different arrangement of the parietal folds of the armature. (See Science Gossip, 1896, vol. III., p. 89. Dr. Jousseaume calls it a large variety of C. erronea, and I think he is correct.)\n\n16.\u2014C. Beddome\u00e6, Hanley.\n\nThis species is not common here. The shells found in Ambagamuwa appear to be a good deal smaller than those found at a lower elevation, where they are more plentiful.\nHabitat in heavy forest beneath fallen leaves. Ambagamuwa specimens measure: height 4 mm., diameter 15 mm.\n\n17.\u2014*Plectopylis clathratula*, Pfr.\n\nThis species is fairly abundant. The shells are much smaller than the type figured in the *Conchologia Indica*. The animal is pale brownish-red, visible through the translucent shell.\n\nHabitat on the under side of decaying leaves in forest. Dimensions: height 2\u00b720 mm., diameter 5 mm.\n\n18.\u2014*Acavella Waltoni*, Jouss. (*Helix Waltoni*, Reeve.)\n\nThis is one of the commonest species in the district. The shells are very variable in size and colouration, some of them being extremely handsome. The Ambagamuwa specimens are, as a rule, smaller than those found at lower elevations.\n\nThe animal is inky black, with dark bluish-gray tentacula. It is oviparous in April\u2013September. The eggs have white calcareous shells, usually measuring 21 mm. in length and 12\u00b750 mm. in width. They are deposited singly, in leaf mould, around the roots of trees in forest. The embryonic shells, which are thin and almost transparent, are beautifully variegated.\n\nHabitat in forest undergrowth and under fallen leaves.\n\n19.\u2014*Acavus superba*, Pfr.\n\nThis species is represented in Ambagamuwa by a beautiful variety (*var. roseolabiata*), which is figured in the *Conchologia Indica* as *Helix superba*.\n\nNevill has, however, pointed out that this is in reality quite distinct from Pfeiffer\u2019s type, although the difference does not appear to have been noticed by Mr. Hanley.*\n\nPerfect specimens of this form are seldom seen. They invariably, when old, become coated with a slimy lichenous growth, which gradually destroys the bright colouring of the shells. This is doubtless a protection against birds and other\n\n---\n\n*Journal, R. A. S., Bengal, 1881, No. III., p. 134.*\nenemies, for it renders the shells scarcely distinguishable, at first sight, from knotty excrescences on the trunks of the trees upon which they live.\n\nThe animal is of a light chocolate colour, with large and prominent tentacula. The upper surface of the foot is coarsely tuberculated. It is oviparous in April-September. The eggs, which have yellowish-white, oblong, calcareous shells, are usually 22 mm. long and 13\u00b760 mm. in breadth. Young specimens are particularly handsome, their shells being variegated with white markings, which however become obliterated as the shells increase in size.\n\nHabitat, on the trunks of trees in damp shady localities. Seldom seen above 3,500 ft.\n\nFAM. ACHATININ\u00c6.\n\n20.\u2014Glessula inornata, Pfr.\n\nThis species is abundant in the district. The animal is yellowish-white, and emits a peculiar acrid smell when molested\u2014probably protective. It is oviparous in April-August. I have taken specimens in those months containing eight to ten young shells with the first three whorls already formed. They lie close together, in a chain, within the second largest whorl of the parent shell, through which they are dimly visible.\n\nHabitat in forest, beneath decaying leaves. A filmy epiphragm closes the aperture of the shell in the dry season.\n\n21.\u2014G. niteus, Gray.\n\nOne or two specimens, taken in the lower part of the district, have been identified by Dr. Jousseaume as an opaque variety of this species.\n\n22.\u2014G. parabilis, Benson.\n\nI have only one specimen, found in the lower part of the district (2,000 ft.).\n\n23.\u2014Opeas gracilis, Hutt.\n\nVery common under logs and stones throughout the district. It appears to be widely distributed.\nFam. Bulimin\u00e6.\n\n24.\u2014Phengus intermedius, Pfr.\n\nBulimus (Beddomea) intermedius, Pfr.\n\nThis species, as figured in Conchologia Indica (pl. xxi., figs. 6-8), is somewhat common in Ambagamuwa. Dr. Jousseaume has remarked that the figures given in the Conchologia Indica appear to belong to two different species (Proc. Zool. France, 1894, p. 295). In reality, however, they are identical, the species being very variable in size and contour. The shells have a beautiful glossy appearance as a rule, but I have taken specimens (alive) with the enamel entirely worn away. The animal is of a rich emerald green, with yellow tentacles and foot. It is visible through the semi-transparent shell.\n\nHabitat amongst foliage in forest, 3,000 to 4,000 ft. It is sometimes found feeding on coffee and tea plants.\n\nObs.\u2014G. Nevill, writing in 1881, after the publication of the Conchologia Indica, mentions this species as follows:\n\nSub-genus Beddomea, G. Nevill.\n\n(Hand list, 1878, p. 127, type Bul. ceylanicus, Pfr.)\n\nThe animal of the type species of this very distinct and well-marked group was described by E. L. Layard (Annual Magazine, 1853) as of a brilliant green colour, visible through the shell; it feeds on the coffee plant. (J. A. S., Bengal, No. III., p. 134.)\n\nThis description is true of B. intermedius but not of B. ceylanicus (see Conchologia Indica, pl. xxi., fig. 2; and pl. cxlviii., fig. 9). The latter is a low-country species, having a much thicker shell with brilliantly coloured markings, while B. intermedius is always white.\n\n25.\u2014Phengus Simoni, Jouss.\n\nThis species is not so common as the last. It is, as Dr. Jousseaume has pointed out, distinct from B. albizonatus of Reeve, by its smaller size and by the absence of the white band at the angle of the shell. It is, moreover, much less sharply keeled, and the shell is thicker and more blue in colour. Habitat in forest, on the leaves of trees.\nFAM. CYCLOSTOMIN\u00c6.\n\n26.\u2014Pterocyclos Cumingii, Pfr.\n\nI have a few specimens from Lower Ambagamuwa, but the species does not occur in the upper part of the district. Habitat in decaying vegetation, 2,000 ft.\n\n27.\u2014Aulopoma helicinum, Chemn.\n\nThis species is common throughout the district. The outer whorl of the operculum is flexible and retractile, and does not always overlap the peristome of the shell, as some observers have stated.\n\nHabitat in thick scrub, lantana, &c., among fallen leaves.\n\n28.\u2014Cyclophorus annulatus, Troschel.\n\nThis species is common throughout the district. The shells taken in the lower part of the district are as a rule larger than those found above an altitude of 3,000 ft.\n\nI have one large specimen, taken alive, with the two first (central) whorls of the shell absent. Young specimens are striated in the line of growth by short bristly ridges of the epidermis.\n\nHabitat in forest and scrub, beneath fallen leaves.\n\n29.\u2014C. Bairdii, Pfr.\n\nI have found this species fairly abundant among fallen leaves in heavy forest.\n\nYoung shells are coated with an olive-brown velvety epidermis, which disappears on full-grown specimens.\n\n30.\u2014C. ceylanicus, Pfr.\n\nThis species is common in Lower Ambagamuwa, but does not occur in the upper part of the district. It is a low-country species.\n\n31.\u2014C. Jerdoni, Benson.\n\nThis is very near the last species. I have one specimen from the lower part of the district.\n\n32.\u2014C. cratera, Benson.\n\nThis species is not common here. I have found a few specimens among fallen leaves in forest, 3,000 ft.\n33.\u2014*C. subplicatus*, Beddome.\n\nThis is a rare species, especially in the upper part of the district.\n\nThe figure given in the *Conchologia Indica* is misleading and not at all like Col. Beddome's type. (See *Proc. Zool. Soc.*, 1875, p. 442.)\n\nYoung specimens are coated with a greenish-brown velvety epidermis.\n\nHabitat in heavy forest, beneath fallen leaves.\n\n34.\u2014*C. Layardi*, H. Adams.\n\nI have found a few specimens of this beneath fallen leaves in forest, 3,600 ft. It is not common here.\n\n35.\u2014*Leptopoma orophilum*, Benson.\n\nThis species is fairly abundant in thick scrub, *lantana*, &c., and amongst undergrowth in forest. The animal is dark yellow, with yellowish-brown tentacula (2). It is frequently attacked by the larva of a carabid beetle, which, having killed the animal, completes its metamorphosis within the shell.* I have also found exuvia of this larva, but less frequently, in the shells of *Glessula* and *Cataulus*.\n\n36.\u2014*Jerdonia ceylanica*, Beddome.\n\nThis species is scarce in Ambagamuwa. I have found a few specimens in forest undergrowth. The epidermis of the shell, which contains the colouring, is easily destroyed, so that perfect specimens are not often seen.\n\nFAM. MEGALOSTOMIN\u00c6.\n\n37.\u2014*Cataulus Blanfordi*, Dohrn.\n\nThis species is fairly common throughout the district. The shells are rather variable in size and colour and in the thickness of the margin of the peristome. The animal is greenish-brown, with orange-coloured tentacula, at the base of which the eyes are situated.\n\n* Mr. E. Ernest Green, who kindly examined the insect for me, was unable to identify the species. I have not secured specimens of the imago yet.\nThe operculum of this, and of the other species of the genus, consists of a flat horny disc separable into many plates. These plates increase in number as the animal grows older. The operculum of young specimens consists of a single film, thin and transparent.\n\nHabitat in heavy forest, beneath decaying leaves.\n\n38.\u2014C. Nietneri, Nevill.\n\nThis species is not common in Ambagamuwa. It is the most aberrant species of its genus, and is itself very variable in size and contour.\n\nIt is gregarious, being sometimes found in numbers of a dozen specimens; but it is extremely local, and only occurs in certain favoured localities, which are sometimes only a few square yards in area. The animal is very dark green, visible through the straw-coloured shell, to which it gives a very pretty appearance.\n\nHabitat in low brushwood and among ferns in swampy places. The figure given of this species in the Conchologia Indica is poor and misleading.\n\nList of identified Mollusca from Ambagamuwa.\n\n1. Helix similaris ... F\u00e9r.\n2. H. acuducta ... Bens.\n3.

The President said that the Paper was of the kind that the Society was anxious to receive, and it was evidently the result of much careful research in a direction in which practically nothing had been written.\n\n4. Mr. Haly said he had on the previous day come across an appropriate passage in Wallace's \"Natural Selection\" (1891, p. 90), which he would read, instead of making any comments of his own on the Paper before them. Wallace wrote:\u2014\"Although such a store of interesting facts has been already accumulated, the subject we have been discussing is one of which comparatively little is really known. The natural history of the tropics has never yet been studied on the spot with a full appreciation of what to observe. The varied ways in which the colouring and form of animals serve for their protection, their strange disguises as mineral or vegetable substances, their wonderful mimicry of other beings, offer an almost unworked and inexhaustible field for the Zoologist, and will assuredly throw much light on the laws and conditions which have resulted in the wonderful variety of colour, shade, and marking which constitute one of the most pleasing characteristics of the animal world, but the immediate cause of which it has hitherto been most difficult to explain.\" Mr. Haly added that he trusted they would have more Papers of this sort, not only from Mr. Collett, but from other gentlemen interested in the Natural History of Ceylon.\n\n5. Mr. C. M. Fernando then read the following Paper:\u2014\nANCIENT CITIES AND TEMPLES IN THE KURUNEGALA DISTRICT.\n\nBy F. H. MODDER.\n\nIV.\u2014DAMBADENIYA.\n\nDambadeniya, in Dambadeniya Udukaha Korale West, of the Dambadeniya Hatpattu, is, according to the latest Itinerary, only 17.95 miles from Kurunegala on the road thence to Negombo, although Casie Chitty gives the distance as \u201cabout 27 miles south of Kurunegala and 56 east of Colombo.\u201d\n\n* Ceylon Gazetteer, p. 84. The Mahavamsa (Wijesinha\u2019s translation) says:\u2014\u201cAnd in the vast space which extended from the city of Jambuddon to the city of Sirivaddhana, the length and breadth whereof was about eight yojanas and one usabha, (the highway was) made even like the face of a drum, and was covered throughout with sand, exceeding fine and soft.\u201d Dr. Coplestone has conclusively pointed out that \u201ceight yojanas\u201d is a misreading, the word in the original being half. This discovery has resulted in establishing beyond all question that the graphic description in chapter LXXXV. does not apply, as it had all this time been considered to, to Kandy, but to a city the exact site of which has not yet with any degree of certainty been traced out and identified, not far from Dambadeniya. Dr. Coplestone (on the authority of Mr. D. M. de Z. Wickremasingha) identifies \u201cthe auspicious and prosperous city\u201d with Nambambaraya, 6 miles from Dambadeniya (Journ. C.B.R.A.S., No. 43, pp. 206\u201315). But Mr. H. Parker is of opinion that it existed in what is now a tract of dense jungle on the right bank of the Deduru-oya in the Wanni Hatpattu. He has in his possession an ola manuscript, which gives the boundaries of the lands attached to the city; and he has received vague accounts of bricks and pillars having been seen in the forest by hunters, there being no inhabitants in the neighbourhood. At Nambambaraya, on the contrary, there is not the slightest vestige of any remains to justify the identification (Cey. Lit. Reg., vol. VI., p. 396). The correct identification of Siriwardhanapura will ever be looked forward to with considerable interest, it having been demonstrated beyond all doubt that the \u201cmountain capital\u201d is out of the running.\nDerivation and Ancient Boundary Limits.\n\nThe \"boundary book,\" called \"\u015ari Laka Ka\u1e0dayuru,\" or \"the divisions of La\u1e45k\u0101,\" records the following particulars under the head of \"Dambadeni Ra\u1e6da\" :\n\nAt R\u0101va\u1e47a's time here was a damba branch watch-hut from the damba tree that marks Dambadiva (Damba atu paela). During the eras of Kakusanda, K\u014dn\u0101gama, K\u0101ksheyapa, and Gautama the name was unchanged. As ancient priests sat on the top of those rocks\u2014as the ancient Nighanda and Nighendi had a controversy there\u2014and planted damba branches there, it was called Jambudhroni Nagara. On the east, damming the oya, there is the village Aetugal piyassa. East of that is the N\u0101nu rock carved with the elephant's foot-mark. Three yoduns off that is Morugama-piyassa, an iyangama. East of that, near the great mountain, is the clump of mora trees, and there is a stone post with an ox-hoof mark. On the north-east is the Maha Tal Ruk Saldigama, and in the midst of an atala-gala a deodonu mark (rainbow mark). On the south is Pera Mahat P\u0101ya. Where all the people of La\u1e45k\u0101 were fed with gruel, a city, a gawa in extent, existed, called the great Batgama, and this village had no bounds; the tank east of it was Mi-waewa. Between east and north-east are the mi gardens and a stone image, and a carved staff (ketu saera mitiyak), and a yamaya and a sword, carved in the middle of seven stone rails (gal raen satak). Where a former king impaled an enemy, the village was called Tubu-ulala.* There are thirty-six marks. The centre is a tank, and there is a staff and (tal waetiya) fan-carved stone. On the north there is the rock, where milk used to be boiled by the Bamunugama. There is a Malaya Pora carved stone kept upon a knotted kumbuk tree. In the midst of the Dikwaella a king stabbed a king, and the (sword) tip fell off: there is a village called Kadumuna\u2020 (sword tip). That village has twelve gal raen, carved with a sword. Where the damba branch formerly fell, at Denipota, a stone was placed, carved with the rainbow (deodunna) and s\u0101ma saera (? s\u0101ma arrow). On the north-west side of Dambadeniya is the oya and N\u0101nu rock. 10,000 villages are in this. In those villages is a mul ka\u1e6demak (? inscription), at three corners an atala-gala carved with sword and shield (kadu palandu). The people here are all liars, and the women learn the high sciences.\u2021\n\nFounding and Description of the City.\n\nDambadeniya was once a royal residence and the capital of the Maya division, albeit now an insignificant village.\n\n* Modern Tumbulla.\u2014M. \u2020 Modern Kavudumuna.\u2014M.\n\u2021 Taprobanian, vol. II., pt. III., p. 60. [The whole passage from the Kadaim-pota needs retranslation,\u2014B., Hon. Sec.]\nIn consequence of its ancient importance and renown, a Hatpattu and two K\u00f3ral\u00e9s are called after it.\n\nThe city of Dambadeniya, or Jambudoni, was founded in 1236 A.D. by King Vijaya B\u00e1hu III., who was of the lineage of King \u015ari Sa\u1e45ga Bo. During the usurpation of M\u00e1gha the country was in a state of disturbance, and Vijaya B\u00e1hu, having remained in concealment for some time, gained sovereignty over all the Wanni country; and having collected an army of Sinhalese went forth and dispersed the Tamils and delivered the beautiful country of Maya from the enemy.*\n\nAnd on the highest top of the Jambudoni mountain he built a pleasant city with walls and gates of great beauty; and the wise and valiant lord of the land dwelt there in ease and comfort, and governed the kingdom.*\n\nThe \"Dambad\u00e9yi Asna,\" which is a historical account of the ancient city, gives the following descriptive particulars:\n\nWithout the walls [of the temple] were built watch-houses [guard-rooms] and the royal stores. Several tanks were also constructed, and a rampart was also built round the city, of which the following are the streets: Agampadi Vidiya, \"Mercenaries' street;\" Parivari Vidiya, \"Attendants' street;\" Setti Vidiya, \"Merchants' or Chetties' street.\" The Magistrate, the Military Officers, and other chiefs of the different parts of the city dwelt in it, together with 24,000 Sinhalese soldiers paid by the Royal Treasury; 900 sculptors; 800 potters; the priesthood with the Sangar\u00e1ja; 900 elephant-keepers, including the keepers of the state-elephant; and 890 horsekeepers, who belonged to the city. Exclusive of their houses, there were 75,000 houses of the potters and 75,000 wells within the city wall.\n\nNot a vestige of the city remains. On Malig\u00e1-kanda, more particularly described hereafter, it is said stood the royal palace, of which, however, not a trace is to be found.\n\nThe Temples and other Buildings.\n\nKing Vijaya B\u00e1hu built an \u00c1r\u00e1ma and called it after his own name\u2014Vijayasundara \u00c1r\u00e1ma\u2014and dedicated it to the priesthood. It is mentioned with due praise in the\n\n* Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa, LXXXI., 16 (p. 272).\n\"R\u00e1jaratn\u00e1karaya\" that the king established a school in every village and charged the priests who superintended them to take nothing from the pupils for their trouble.\n\nHe reigned four years, and was succeeded by his son Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu III., who was crowned, according to the \"Dambadeni Asna,\" at Dambadeniya during the sowing festival in the year 1824 of the Buddhist era, under the name of Sarvaj\u00f1a Pandita Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu. He adorned the city and\u2014\n\nBrought forth the Tooth-relic from the Billa mountain (Beligala) with great pomp and ceremony unto the noble city of Jambudoni. And he caused a Tooth-relic house of great beauty to be built nigh unto the palace, at great cost, seeing that he had a great desire to worship the relic whenever he thought thereof, even during the three periods of the day. And he raised a costly altar in the midst thereof and covered it with a cloth of great value, and caused a receptacle for the Tooth-relic to be cut out of a precious stone of great size; and to cover it he made a large casket of exceeding great beauty of precious gems of divers colours: and a second casket of great brightness made he of five thousand nikkh\u00e1s of gold to cover this; and a third of twenty-five thousand nikkh\u00e1s of silver to cover the last.*\n\nAccording to the \"Dambadeni Asna\" the rock of Dambadeni, on which the King M\u00e1nabarana failed to erect any conspicuous building, was cleared of jungle, and on it was built a temple for the Tooth-relic, 22 cubits in height with three stories, and surrounded by a wall 80 cubits high.\n\nAnd after he had caused the city to be decorated, commencing from the Relic-house, he held the great feast of the Tooth-relic with great honours.* ...... And after the lord of the land offered unto the Tooth-relic the sixty-four royal ornaments, including his crown and his bracelets and such like\u2020 ...... Round about the vih\u00e1ra Siri Vijayasundara, that the king his father had built, he raised lofty walls and gates, and repaired and renewed the three-storied Relic-house. There also he set the Tooth-relic of the great sage on a high and costly throne.\u2021\n\n* Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1 (English translation), LXXXII., 7\u201315 (pp. 276-7). The greater portion of this chapter is taken up with an account of the exhibition of the Tooth-relic miracle.\n\n\u2020 Ibid, LXXXII., 50 (p. 279).\n\n\u2021 Ibid, LXXXV., p. 291. Among the regulations of the temple was that \"every day an offering was made of 100,000 flowers, and every day of a different kind.\" (Upham's R\u00e1jaratn\u00e1karaya, p. 103.)\nThe king also\u2014\n\nBuilt round about the city many monasteries for the whole Order in common (Sa\u1e45ghar\u0101ma), that were fit places for the abode of the eight great elders of the eight establishments and for learned and thoughtful elders who dwelt in villages and in the forests. And these were buildings of great breadth, and were adorned with many mansions composed of open halls in great number, with ponds of divers kinds, and covered walks surrounded by gardens of fruits and flowers that served as retreats both by day and night.*\n\nHe also brought elders learned in the scriptures from India, and the books that were necessary for them. The \"Bhaysujja Ma\u00f1jus\u00e1\"\u2014a P\u00e1li work\u2014was composed about this time by the learned and benevolent elder, the chief of the monks of the Pa\u00f1cha Parivena.\n\nThe king \"caused the priests of La\u1e45k\u00e1 to be taught in all the branches of religion, and logic, and grammar, and all the other sciences, and made learned men of many priests.\"\u2020 He adorned the royal palace like the palace of the chief gods, and decorated the city befittingly like unto the city of the gods.\n\nOn the murder of Vijaya B\u00e1hu IV. by his treacherous general Mitta, Bhuwaneka B\u00e1hu I., who had fled to Y\u00e1pahuwa, was brought from that city and anointed king at Dambadeniya, where he took up his abode. After some years he removed his seat of government to Y\u00e1pahuwa.\n\nThe \"Dambad\u00e9ni Asna,\" after giving a rambling account of the city, describes graphically the war between P\u00e0\u1e47\u1e0dita Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu and the Tamils, and the hand-to-hand combat between the king and \"Tamalingomu,\" in which the former came off victorious.\n\nThe kings who reigned at Dambadeniya appear to have encouraged the cultivation of useful arts and sciences amongst their subjects, and possessed a large collection of valuable books of medicine in their public library.\n\nThe Modern Temple Library.\n\nIn this connection it may not be uninteresting to note the state of the modern library. Mr. D. M. de Z. Wickremasingha,\n\n* Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa, LXXXIV., 18\u201320 (p. 284). \u2020 Ibid, 27 (p. 285).\nAssistant Librarian of the Museum (now employed in the British Museum), visited the library in 1889 and reported as follows:\n\nBefore making inquiries for the manuscripts we went about the temple premises inspecting the several buildings, accompanied by the Chief Priest, who acted as our guide. Whilst walking about we talked of the history of Dambadeniya, and especially of the famous scholar who flourished there of old. In this way we gradually directed the conversation to the several ancient libraries of Ceylon, such as that founded by Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, and to manuscripts in general. By the time we returned to the temple we had obtained permission from the Chief Priest to examine the library with the object of borrowing such manuscripts as we might wish to have copied.\n\nThere was no catalogue of the manuscripts, nor any sign of arrangement. These were in three different places: some in an almirah in a room on the ground-floor, some scattered on a table in another room near by, and others in a dirty old box in a loft, where they were allowed to rot. The Chief Priest told us that there had been another box full of manuscripts, which had been destroyed by white ants. I warned him that that would be the fate of the rest of the books if better care was not taken of them.*\n\nAfter going through the collection of books some were borrowed for the Museum Library, among them \"Kalund\u00e1-pa\u1e6duna\" (Sinhalese verse), a legend connected with the accession of Pandita Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu III. of Dambadeniya.\n\nThe information given in this little poem, as well as in the R\u00e1java\u1e37iya, discovered by me in the Wanni District, and in the Mah\u0101vansa, will, I think, settle the vexed question as to the site of the ancient Siriwardhanapura founded by Pandita Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu III. in the thirteenth century. These works show that Upham, Pridham, Knighton, Tennent, and others who followed them are more or less wrong in ascribing the founding of the modern Kandy to King Pandita Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu III.*\n\nApproach to, and Description of, Temple Premises.\n\nThe temple is approached by a m\u00e1wata which branches off from near the ambalam to the left. A quarter of a mile along\n\n* Administration Reports, Colombo Museum, 1889, p. I 18. See as to Siriwardhanapura the foot-note at the commencement of this Paper. Dr. Copleston was materially assisted in arriving at the conclusions therein referred to by Mr. Wickremasinha's researches.\nit brings you to the entrance to the temple precincts, which are surrounded by a wall built of rock stones, roughly hewn. The door frame is composed of rock and the clumsy and unwieldy shutter of wood. On the temple grounds, to the right, is a d\u0101gaba, which is roofed over with tiles, and on the left is the vih\u0101r\u0113, with a little upstairs, which leads into the chamber in which the Tooth-relic is said to have been kept. The temple is a small one, and, with the exception of the rock pillars and ornaments, seems, like the d\u0101gaba, to be of modern construction, the former probably having been built with the remains and in the site of the ancient edifice. In the front of the temple there is another entrance similar to the one just mentioned, which leads in the direction of Malig\u0101-kanda, and was no doubt used by the kings of old in repairing thither for devotion. On the right of the entrance stands an old b\u00f3-tree, which is enclosed in the form of a square by a low stone wall, the space between the tree and the wall being filled in with sand. Offerings are made on a stone table, which is reached by a short flight of steps. The pansala stands outside the temple wall, and bears all the appearance of a modern structure. In February, 1892, a bana-g\u00e9 was being erected by some Moratuwa carpenter, close to the pansala, in the modern style.\n\nRocky Hills and Legends.\n\nPridham and Casie Chitty agree to the very letter in their description of the situation of Dambadeniya:\n\nIt stands in a very picturesque valley, which is terminated by ranges of lofty naked hills, rising perpendicularly in a variety of peaked forms.*\n\nHardy remarks:\n\nAbove the city is a rock about 400 ft. high, nearly inaccessible, standing alone like the house of some giant. The folk-lore of the neighbourhood presents many curious legends.\u2020\n\nMalig\u0101-kanda lies to the south-east of the temple, and on it, it is said, stood the palatial residence of King P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dita\n\n* Pridham, vol. II., p. 648; Casie Chitty, p. 84.\n\u2020 Jubilee Memorials of the Wesleyan Mission, 1814\u201316.\nPar\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu. There is some vegetation on the rock, as well as two ponds built with cut stones. There is no beaten track leading up to the hill, but any villager can guide the visitor to its summit. Before arriving at the top of the hill there are to be seen remains of a wall built between the boulders of granite. Past this wall there are some stone steps which lead to the spot, where there is an indication of a \"patirippuwa\" having once stood. Here, sitting on his royal chair, the king held an audience with his people. Before you come to the site of the \"patirippuwa\" a small tank is past. The whole hill is overgrown with jungle, and it is with the utmost difficulty that one is able to climb it. From the summit a splendid view of the surrounding country is obtained, with Kat-gala and Waduw\u00e1-gala in the near distance. It is said that the offerings to the king were placed on Kat-gala, and were viewed by him from the top of Mali\u011f\u00e1-kanda. Between the two boulders there is a cleft, with marks to be seen on either flank of the rock, to fit in a cross-beam, from which, tradition says, convicted criminals were hurled down and killed.\n\nWaduw\u00e1-gala stands to the north of the above-described hill, and on the right of the high road. It is a cylindrical boulder with the top and bottom overgrown with grass and brushwood. It derives its name from the circumstance that a convict carpenter, who was imprisoned on it, made his escape by cutting steps in the rock. These steps are yet to be seen, and by them access to the summit is gained. The steps begin about ten fathoms from the base of the hill, and in order to get at them a ladder is required, and is easily procurable, made by the villagers at a moment's notice of rough timber, lashed together with jungle rope. Tradition has it that the wife of the carpenter secreted a chisel and a mallet in the bat-mulla, i.e., the boiled rice that is bound up in the spathe of the arecanut, and is the usual manner in which a meal is carried by a native going on a journey away from home and kindred, or conveyed to him to his working\nplace, by his wife or child. The steps were cut overnight and during the small hours, when\u2014\n\nThe varlets they were all asleep\nAnd none was there to see,\n\nthe escape was effected. The carpenter fled to the village Waduw\u00e1wa, which is said to derive its name from the fact of his taking refuge there; but alas! he was overtaken, seized, and decapitated. There is a large tank on the summit, into which it is said criminals were hurled.\n\nKat-gala lies between the above two hills on the left of the road. It is a bare, elongated boulder, and runs north to south. It is so called owing to its having been the halting-place of the pingo-bearers, who deposited their loads on it on their way to the king's reception at this city, when it was a royal residence.\n\nCoins.\n\nDavy says:\n\nAn antique gold coin, called a Dambadinia rhatra, was found in the neighbourhood of Dambadinia in the Seven Korles, which was probably struck there when it was a place of royal residence.* This coin exactly resembles in size and appearance the Dambadinia chally...... The chally is a copper coin, of which two kinds are to be met with\u2014Dutch challies, which are common; and the Dambadinia challies, which are scarce. The characters on this ancient coin resemble more hieroglyphics than letters; the natives are ignorant of their meaning, which has not yet been ascertained.\u2020\n\nPrinsep, in a note on this and other coins sent to him for report by Sir Wilmot Horton, identified it with that found by Colonel Mackenzie at Dipaldinna, which he held to be identical with Dambadeniya, adding that Davy did not seem to have comprehended either the devices or the characters on this coin, for he had reversed, in the engraving in his book, the side bearing the inscription. Casie Chitty \"rejects the claims of the Singhalese to a Singhalese origin of these coins,\" and conjectures that they may possibly be of\n\n* Hardy observes: \"There are coins found in various places in the Island that are said to have been minted here in the twelfth century.\" (Jubilee Memorials of the Wesleyan Mission, 1814-64, p. 134.)\n\u2020 An Account of the Interior of Ceylon, pp. 245-6.\nTamil origin, and been struck by King El\u00e1la \"in commemoration of his splendid conquests in Ceylon.\"*\n\n**British Reminiscences.**\n\nIn the campaign of 1803, Dambadeniya played no unimportant part as a post of defence of the British. The troops under the immediate command of Major-General Macdowall, on their march to Kandy, encamped at Dambadeniya on February 11, \"all well and in high spirits.\" Cordiner gives the following particulars:\n\nThe encampment was formed upon a hill on which paddee was growing, and the prospects around it were highly picturesque and delightful. On each side below the camp were pleasant vallies, terminated by ranges of mountains. Owing to a deficiency of supplies, chiefly attributed to the death of Mr. Hamilton, Collector of the Province of Colombo, the army was obliged to halt at this place for four days. A small fort was erected, and a detachment of one hundred men left in it under the command of Ensign Grant. The troops continued to enjoy good health, although the nature of the climate did not seem salutary. The heat during the day was intense and oppressive, and the cold and heavy dews during the night were no less unpleasant, Fahrenheit's thermometer often ranging in the course of twenty-four hours from 60\u00b0 to 100\u00b0.\n\nIn a store-house at Dambadenia were found eight hundred parrahs of paddee, fifty of salt, and as many of oil, said to belong to the First Adigar.\n\nOn the 25th, \"Captain Buchan, of the Ceylon Infantry, marched with a strong party to convey coolies laden with provisions from Dambadenia. None of the natives ventured to approach the capital; and it was not without difficulty and danger that foraging parties obtained now and then small supplies; they were often fired upon from unseen quarters, and a few men were daily wounded.\"\n\nOn the suggestion that \"His Excellency's performing a tour in the Seven Corales might have a good effect in quieting the apprehensions of the natives and increasing their confidence in the protection which had been promised them by the British Government, the Governor Mr. North, accompanied by Mr. Robert Arbuthnot, Chief Secretary of Government, Mr. Jonville, Surveyor-General, and his personal staff, set out on this journey\" on April 28.\n\n---\n\n* Journal, R.A.S.C.B., vol. I., p. 85. [The massa, figured upside down by Dr. Davy, belongs to Queen Lilavati (\u015ari R\u0101ja Lilavati), 1203\u201312 A.D. circa.

Sec.]\nHe arrived at Dambadenia, the principal station in the fruitful Province of the Seven Corales, on the 1st of May. Spacious bungaloes had been prepared for the reception of him and his suite, and temporary barracks were erected for the soldiers who formed his escort. The same day the principal headmen of the neighbourhood waited upon him, declared their satisfaction with the change of government which had taken place, and promised obedience and fidelity to our most gracious Sovereign.\n\nOn the 3rd of May, Pelime Palawve, the Chief Adigar, waited on the Governor, with whom he held a long conference, and fully agreed to the terms which had been drawn up in Kandy by General Macdowall and the Second Adigar. Mr. Arbuthnot returned the visit of Pelime Palawve the next day, and tendered to him three copies of the Convention, which he signed and sealed.\n\nColonel Barbut, who commanded at Candy, having received notice of the intended conference at Dambadenia, embraced the opportunity of paying his respects to Mr. North, and repaired thither escorted by three hundred men of the Malay regiment.\n\nThe Adigar, during his interview with the Governor, was observed to tremble, which circumstance was at that time attributed to fear; but it has since been proved that he then meditated to make Mr. North a prisoner, and was only deterred from the attempt by the force of his escort, and the unexpected arrival of the strong detachment of Malays under Colonel Barbut.\n\nOn May 4 \"the headmen of the Pale-pattoos, or southern division of the Seven Corales,\" and those of the \"Dolos-pattoo, the northern division of the Province,\" waited on His Excellency \"with expressions of fidelity to the crown of Great Britain and of attachment to his person and government.\"\n\nAt the same time that Candy was taken, the fort of Dambadenia was in a state of blockade. It was a small redoubt, slightly constructed of fascines and earth, and garrisoned by fourteen convalescents of the 19th regiment on their way to Colombo, and twenty-two invalid Malays, commanded by Ensign John Grant of that corps. He was repeatedly summoned by the Candians, headed by the Second Adigar, to give up the post. They sent in a flag of truce every day for upwards of a week; offered him a supply of coolies to carry off the sick, and solemnly declared that they would allow the detachment to march out unmolested, with their arms, and whatever else they chose to take with them. Ensign Grant, though in a feeble state of health, almost incapable of walking, would listen to none of their proposals. He strengthened the shelter of his fortification with bags of rice and stores of provision, and sustained almost an incessant fire from a mob of several thousand Candians for ten days. His men lay sheltered behind a breastwork, and only took an occasional aim at the enemy, when they came very near.\nThe detachment under Ensign Smellie, which left Colombo on the 26th of June, afforded the small garrison of Dambadenia a seasonable relief on the 30th of the same month.\n\nOn the 2nd of July, a reinforcement of one hundred men was sent from Colombo to assist in accomplishing the evacuation of that post. This party was commanded by Captain Robert Blackall of His Majesty's 51st Regiment, who reached Dambadenia in three days, and after destroying in one night a large quantity of stores and provisions in that depot, completely succeeded in bringing off the garrison.*\n\nSite of the British Fort.\n\nPridham, Casie Chitty, and other writers refer to the fort as having stood on a hill. According to the information gathered on the spot, this could not be so; it must have stood some distance from M\u00e1ligakanda on a plot of rising ground, approached by a path, which forms the boundary limit between the villages Dambadeniya and Muttugala, and branches off to the left of the high road. After going along the path about a quarter of a mile, you turn to the right and you come upon the site overgrown with jungle. There are signs of a moat, which it is said surrounded the fort. The villagers say that the ground here abounds in ruins, and that in its vicinity they could not dig deeper than a foot owing to the rocky foundation and d\u00e9bris, probably of the fort, which they came across.\n\nService Tenure.\n\nDambadeniya is subject to services to the Dalada M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa of Kandy. The following list, which sets out the various pangu, extent of high and low land appertaining thereto, the nature of the services, and the amount of commutation, was prepared by the writer from materials kindly placed at his disposal by Appuhami Lekama of Dambadeniya:\n\n---\n\n* Cordiner, vol. II., pp., 175-219.\u2014In connection with the remarkably brave and determined manner in which Ensign Grant held the fort, it may be mentioned that the natives assert, but unfortunately can give no particulars, that a certain officer in defending this post was shot down, whereupon his wife, with wonderful courage, filled in the breach and assumed command, and held out till succour arrived.\n| Pangu                  | Fields | Gardens | Chenas | Commuted value of Services |\n|-----------------------|--------|---------|--------|----------------------------|\n|                       | A.

Dambadeni, as well as the other districts, Yapahuwa and Chilaw, formerly belonged to the Central Province, with a central working committee at Kandy. Subsequently the North-Western Province was formed into a separate Province under the Ordinance, unconnected with the Central, but the division into districts remains the same. The Gazette of January 27, 1893, published a list of trustees for the North-Western Province. An amended list was published in the Gazette of October 12, 1894, according to which 93 trustees were appointed for Dambadeni, 111 for Dewamedi, 95 for W\u0119da, and 120 for Katugampola. Let us hope that the accumulated wisdom of this multitude of counsellors will help towards the satisfactory working of the Ordinance, which, it is to be regretted, has not been productive of the best results, at least in the North-Western Province.\n\n6. The Chairman remarked that it was interesting to note that the royal capitals of Ceylon, like the one under discussion, remained as capitals only for a very short period; therefore it was somewhat difficult to place implicit reliance on the details of its grandeur, described in the Mah\u0101wans\u0101, the writer of which might have, like a\ngood courtier, drawn from imagination the elaborate details of a most magnificent city. He had visited the place himself and failed to discover anything like the ruins of so important a town. As to the identity of *Sirivardhanapura*, about which reference had been made in the Paper, it was probable, as its name implied, that it was applied to more than one royal capital, and thus it may have been applied to Kandy itself.\n\n7.

Mr. Harward read the following Paper:\u2014\nA GEOLOGICAL AND MINERALOGICAL SKETCH\nOF THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCE,\nCEYLON.\n\nBy F. H. MODDER.\n\nPrefatory Note.\n\nAn eminent authority has observed that \"the sciences of geology and mineralogy, &c., in all their branches are but imperfectly understood by the natives.\" He might with more truth and less modesty have said they were lamentably ignorant of these useful sciences. \"Notwithstanding Ceylon is the depository of such an extensive variety of specimens, their attention seems never to have extended beyond the valuable gems and the mineral ores. As to a thousand other subjects, both on the surface of the earth and hidden in the substrata of nature, so interesting to men of science, they have allowed them an almost undisturbed repose, never having exerted themselves either to quarry out a knowledge of their latent properties, or ascertain their intrinsic worth.\"*\n\nThe difficulty of prosecuting the investigation of these important and useful branches of science cannot be better summed up than in the words of Professor Fletcher, though his remarks have special reference only to terrestrial mineral products:\n\nIt is practically, or rather economically, possible to obtain a direct knowledge of only those mineral products of the earth itself which are situated within a mile or so beneath its surface; that is to say, within a crust having a thickness which is only one-four thousandth part of the earth's radius; but the detailed investigation of even this limited amount of matter is far too vast for one individual or one science.\n\n* Quoted by Pridham in a footnote.\nIn favouring me with a copy of his \"Guide Book to the Minerals in the British Museum\" (which has been of immense use and service to me), the distinguished author, whose kind sympathy with me in my undertaking I cannot adequately express my gratitude for, wrote to me:\n\nI am afraid you will find it difficult to do very much in the examination of your rocks at Ceylon, unless you are provided with a petrological microscope and have the skill and patience and time for the preparation of thin sections for examination by that instrument\u2014and added with an amount of grim humour:\n\nPeople like yourself, with scientific tastes, can do very useful work in these countries, which are practically inaccessible to those who, like myself, are chained down in these remote regions.\n\nConscious of the manifold shortcomings in this Paper\u2014the result of desultory work undertaken during the leisure which a busy professional life has stintingly bestowed on me\u2014I should hesitate to submit it to this Society, but that my object is to invite the attention and to excite the interest of the authorities, the capitalist, as well as of the student of Nature, to the rich and unlimited field of scientific research which the vast undeveloped geological and mineral resources of the Island afford.\n\nINTRODUCTORY.\n\nCeylon has not been geologically surveyed. Davy (1821) made the first real attempt at describing the geology of the Island, but his personal observations were chiefly confined to the interior.\u2020 Bennett's work (1843) contains a slight reference;\u2021 while Macvicar's comments\u00a7 and Gardner's sketch\u2016 (1847) clearly show that beyond a general survey, these scientists had not the opportunity of diving\n\n* \"An Introduction to the Study of Rocks,\" by L.

Gygax's labours (1848-49) were mainly directed to the examination and report of the mineral resources of the Sabaragamuwa District.* Pridham (1849) adopted the convenient process of \"boiling down\" the results obtained by previous writers, and has with characteristic significance seldom condescended to acknowledge the source of his information.\u2020 Kelaart's excellent \"Notes on the Geology of Ceylon\" (1850) have special reference to the laterite formation of the Island and the fluatile deposit of Nuwara Eliya.\u2021 Baker's remarks (1855) apply almost exclusively to the Nuwara Eliya District.\u00a7 Tennent\u00b6 (1860) and a host of other writers have either bodily adopted the theories, or more frequently based their conclusions on the investigations of the authors who preceded them, particularly with regard to the alleged discovery \"of anthracite, in close proximity to rich veins of plumbago,\" which did not require much labour on the part of the late Mr. A. M. Ferguson to prove and establish beyond the shade of a shadow of doubt to be \"as mythical as Sinbad the Sailor and his gems.\"\u00b6 The late John F. Campbell of Islay (1876), who was eminently qualified to prosecute the subject from a scientific point of view, was unfortunately prevented by the shortness of his stay in Ceylon from devoting the necessary time and attention to it which the importance of the inquiry demanded.** However, his views, such as they\n\n* Journal, C.B.R.A.S., No. 3, 1847-48, pp. 1-5.\n\u2020 \"An Historical, Political, and Statistical Account of Ceylon and its Dependencies,\" by Charles Pridham. 2 vols.

Dixon (1881) spent no inconsiderable portion of his leisure in geological and mineralogical researches, but his investigations throw very little light on this Province.* Several local writers have written fugitive papers, dealing more or less with certain portions of the Island. But none of these authors and writers have explored the interior of any of the plumbago mines in this Province\u2014the shaft of one of which alone has penetrated 1,500 feet into the bowels of the earth. These deep-sunk pits have thrown open large and important sections of strata, from which much knowledge can be gathered of our Island crust, hitherto locked up in the sealed book of Nature.\n\nThe testimony is conflicting with regard to the actual dimensions of the Island as it existed in \"the dark abysm of time,\" when, according to the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, the oldest epic in the world, R\u00e1m\u00e1 proceeded to Lank\u00e1 with a mighty army, waged a protracted war with Ravana, laid seige to his capital, and carried back in triumph the ravished S\u00edt\u00e1, the beautiful queen of the vanquisher, from the jungle fastness, where she remained imprisoned for many a weary year; and it is a moot point whether the ocean now rolls over once fertile and populous lands, and whether this partial subsidence of the Island caused its severance from the mainland of India, of which it formed part. Avoiding all discussion as to whether our beautiful isle has diminished into its present size by the gradual encroachments of the usurping sea,\u2014\n\nWhen were the winds\nLet slip with such a warrant to destroy?\nWhen did the waves so haughtily overleap\nTheir ancient barriers?\n\nit is sufficient to state that changes in the relative position of sea and land are said to have occurred on the maritime\n\n* Journal, C.B.R.A.S., vol. VII., No. 23, 1881, p. 12.\nportions of this Province, and they seem to receive support from this tradition:\n\nIn the time of the famed Queen Allirasani, the Gulf of Kalpitiya had no opening to the northward, but communicated with the sea by a channel running in the line of the present Chilaw canal; that the queen above named used to proceed from Kudremalai to Akkarai pattu by land; and that a great flood came, buried her palace under the waves, and bursting through a neck of land, converted the lake into a gulf, which form it still retains.*\n\nLord Valentia, in 1804, testified to the appearance presented by the \"singular\" island Navakarre,\u2020 which showed every sign of having been formerly covered by the sea. In travelling from Puttalam to Arippo, His Lordship drew the conclusion that the bank forming the outer boundary of the lagoon was formerly part of the ocean. The lagoon, he thought, would soon be filled up, and the sea itself removed to a still greater distance.\u2021\n\nThe opinions of Lord Valentia, Macvicar, Gardner, and Kelaart all favour the hope that the whole of Ceylon, particularly the western coast, would gradually rise above the sea level, and that consequently the time, geologically speaking, is not far distant when the Island will again become united with the Continent of India.\n\nRocks.\n\nThe oldest rocks in the North-Western Province, like the rest of the mountain system of the Island, belong mainly to the Arch\u00e6an or pre-Cambrian age. The prevailing rock is gneiss of a crystalline nature, with no inconsiderable veins of quartz, felspar, mica, and hornblende. This Province forms part of the plain which surrounds the mountain district, and Campbell has likened it to a sea of rolling gneiss with waves on the strike north and south. The dip is\n\n* Journal, C.B.R.A.S., No. 6, 1853.\n\u2020 Akkarapattoo, one of the divisions of the District of Puttalam, improperly denominated in the maps Navacarre.\u2014Casie Chitty's \"Gazetteer,\" p. 4.\n\u2021 Mavor's \"Collection of Travels,\" vol. XXVIII., pp. 136\u201338.\nnearly vertical in general. Yet all the outlines are rounded curves. The stone breaks naturally along this curved surface and shells off in thick layers. Distant hills on the same strike are broken to westward. The gigantic bosses which stud the plain rise conspicuously, \"so detached from the original chain and so rounded by the action of the atmosphere, aided by their concentric lamellation, that, but for their prodigious dimensions, they might be regarded as boulders.\"*\n\nChief among these cylindrical masses is the \"elephant rock\" at Kurun\u00e9gala, where the gneiss is much contorted. The bare gneiss weathers into angular sand and wears into chemical and mechanical \"pot holes.\" The stream which flows out of \"the king's bath,\" a round basin on the elephant rock, is wearing smaller \"pot holes\" below.\n\nThe plain ends with a white sandy beach, in which the rocks are battered. Rocks in the plain have the same forms as rocks in the surf and at sea. If the sea-bottom were raised, asserts Campbell, it would be an extension of the lowlands of Ceylon. From the steamers while approaching and leaving the Island, he says, he saw the usual marks of erosion by streams on the hills and of marine erosion in the plains and in the surf. The low grounds he took for remarkable examples of marine denudation. \"Ceylon, at the end of Asia, is exposed in all directions, save one, to the full sweep of the waves of the Southern Ocean. The surf rolls constantly in over a shelving bottom. At the sea-margin and thence to the hills the shelving surface cuts indifferently through the folds in the gneiss.\"\u2020 The folding of the gneiss is by lateral horizontal pressure from east and west, nearly parallel to the Equator.\n\nThe rocks, plains, and hills of Ceylon may easily be mistaken for glacial work, but Campbell, who travelled nearly 600 miles in the Island, found no mark or sign of glaciation whatsoever. After careful study he believed them\n\n* Tennent's \"Ceylon,\" vol. I., pp. 16, 17.\n\u2020 The Period of Polar Glaciation: Appendix to \"My Circular Notes,\" by J. F. Campbell, vol. II., p. 285 et seq.\nto be the work of the Indian Ocean, aided by a tropical sun and tropical rains.\n\nSupposed Fossil Marks.\u2014Ibb\u00e1gala, or \"tortoise rock,\" at Kurun\u00e9gala, was thought to be of interest from a pal\u00e6ontological point of view, and the details of the supposed discovery of fossil marks were thus stated:\n\nSome of these appear to be the footprints of hogs, others those of some feline beasts of prey. The impression of the paws as well as the toes are so well and distinctly marked and continued along whole tracks as not to be mistaken or confounded with any ripple marks or other irregularities produced by the denudation of its surface. Though Ibb\u00e1gala appears to belong to the class of primitive or plutonic rocks, it appears that there must have been a subsequent super-imposition of sedimentary formations, which, while in a soft state, received the impressions that were rendered permanent by the consolidation or crystallization of their particles. The whole structure of the rock appears to the eye to be composed of hornblende, mica, and felspar, with traces of an impure carbonate of lime.*\n\nThe subject was brought up before the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society by Mr. A. O. Brodie, of Puttalam, and Lieutenant Henderson, of the Ceylon Rifle Regiment, both of whom wrote papers ventilating their views, but unfortunately these papers are lost to the world,\u2020 and the only particulars available are referred to in the minutes of a special meeting held on March 23, 1850.\n\nIn an interesting Paper as to the origin of laterite formation in the Island, Dr. Kelaart wrote in connection with the point at issue\u2014\n\nThis subject is now engaging the attention of the Geological Society of London, their notice being attracted to it by the so-called footprints on the gneissic rock at Kurun\u00e9gala, which I have not yet had an opportunity of examining.\n\n* \"Young Ceylon,\" vol. I., No. 2, March, 1850, p. 49 : Topography of Kornegalle, by T. A. P.\n\n\u2020 A careful reference to the transactions, as well as a diligent search by the Honorary Secretary among the papers of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, failed to discover these papers. Finally, an application by the writer to the Secretary of the Geological Society, London, to which institution, it was said, the original papers were forwarded, was equally fruitless, and elicited the reply from Mr. L. Belifante, Assistant Secretary: \"I can find no trace of the papers to which you refer.\"\nAnd added in a footnote:\u2014\n\nSince this Paper was written I have examined the rock and found it to be laminated granite, and the marks merely the effects of weathering.*\n\nA verdict which the writer is able to concur in after careful personal verification. It is impossible to conceive how these marks on the most exposed part of the surface of the rock could have been mistaken for those of fossils, the more so when it is considered that no such marks, even if real, could have withstood the ravages and the potent effects of weathering and chemical decomposition, which would have obliterated them altogether. As pointed out by Campbell, \"to a given depth the gneiss is daily heated to 100\u00b0 or more. At night it cools. Expansion and contraction produce something like cleavage on a crackle cup. Mechanical and chemical action of rain and air makes the surface crumble.\"\u2020 As an appropriate conclusion to this subject\u2014so brimful of interest to geologists\u2014I would quote the words of Dr. William King, late of the Geological Survey of India, brother of Mr. \u00c6lian Armstrong King, Government Agent of the North-Western Province:\n\nIt is difficult to tell why there are no fossils in your metamorphic rocks. There may have been very little life at the time of their formation, and that of the lowest forms, and these may have been obliterated by metamorphism or so altered that nothing but the result of their chemical decomposition now remains, e.g., this graphite. I do not think age would have anything to do with the obliteration of vegetable structure, if it ever existed; metamorphism (which includes a tremendous lot of forces, chemical and otherwise) is quite sufficient.\u2021\n\n* Appendix of Proceedings of Meeting, Journal, C.B.R.A.S., No. 5. 1849\u201350, pp. 336, 337.\n\n\u2020 \"My Circular Notes,\" vol.

Dr. Kelaart writes: \"The limestone in which the Ceylon fossils are imbedded is of a very compact and pure form. In one hand specimen we observed a fossil phalange about an inch in length, apparently of a large Saurian reptile. This unique specimen is now in the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Ceylon.\"\u2014Prodromus Faun\u00e6 Zeylanic\u00e6, p. x.\nGneiss being the prevailing rock and close at hand is much used for building and other purposes. From a remote period it has been worked into pillars and posts, lintels and doorways for temples and palaces, while the images, in their various shapes and forms to be found in the vih\u0101res in the Province, have nearly all been carved out of the same material. Bailey, in his graphic description of the perforated window at Yapahuwa, regretted that such exquisite workmanship as had been lavished on it should not have been expended on more refined material, for instance, the magnesian limestone, which is so abundant in the Province, than on such rough and coarse stuff as gneiss. It must be noted, however, that though the effects of storm and sunshine of six centuries and more have done their worst to the ruins of temple and palace which have been exposed to their influences, yet such ruins as are yet to be seen, for instance, the perforated window of Yapahuwa, show how well they have withstood the ravages of time and weather. Gneiss is also largely used for metalling roads, and a \"pocket\" on the side of the Kurun\u0113gala rock, near the Galaband\u0101r\u00e9 shrine, from which the stone is being quarried, affords an excellent section of gneissic rock with its various interpolating veins of quartz, &c.\n\nQuartz in large veins as well as in extensive imbedded masses is of common occurrence. Several of such outcrops are to be met with on the Kurun\u0113gala railway line.\n\nDolomite, or crystalline magnesian limestone, which overlies the gneiss, occurs in various parts of the Province. A bed of it has been found to run through the Kurun\u0113gala District in a somewhat parallel direction, striking generally N.W. by N. to N., and having various dips from $10^\\circ$ to $40^\\circ$. Dixon, after indicating two outcrops in the Island, the first near Balangoda and at Hunuwala, the second through Dolosb\u0101ge and Maskeliya, traced the third under the Great Western, at Great Western estate, to be continuous to N.N.W. with Wattegedara and Medakumbura, and probably also with the beds at Gampola and Kurun\u0113gala. In illustration of a\nPaper on \"The Rocks and Minerals of Ceylon,\" he exhibited specimens of dolomite with pyrites and other crystals, and dolomite, large, yellow, free crystals obtained from the Kurun\u00e9gala District.*\n\nMagnesian limestone is to be met with in abundance, chiefly at Hunugalkadulla (so called after the occurrence of this rock, which is known to the natives as Hunugal, or limestone, in such profusion at this village) and Wellowa in the Kurun\u00e9gala District, and is worked for economical purposes.\n\nThe following analyses by Cochran show the composition of the purer forms of crystalline limestone and magnesian limestone or dolomite:\n\n| Composition                        | Crystalline Limestone | Dolomite |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------|\n|                                    | per cent.             | per cent.| per cent.| per cent.|\n| Calcium carbonate                  | 93\u00b779                 | 97\u00b700    | 50\u00b716    | 74\u00b752    |\n| Magnesian carbonate                | 2\u00b751                  | 1\u00b777     | 26\u00b700    | 19\u00b733    |\n| Carbonate of iron                  | \u00b768                   |          |          |          |\n| Phosphate of lime                  | \u00b715                   | \u00b723      |          |          |\n| Alkalies                           | \u00b720                   |          |          |          |\n| Organic matter and moisture        | \u00b747                   |          |          |          |\n| Silica                             | 2\u00b720                  | 1\u00b700     |          |          |\n| Oxide of iron and alumina          | \u2014                     | 3\u00b766     | \u00b735      |          |\n| Alkalies and traces of phosphoric acid... | \u2014                     | \u00b718      | \u00b720      |          |\n| Insoluble silicious matter         | \u2014                     | 19\u00b788    | 5\u00b735     |          |\n| Moisture                           | \u2014                     | \u00b712      | \u00b725      |          |\n\nRecent formations are confined to the sea coast which forms the western boundary of the Province. These formations owe their origin mainly to the deposits which the currents make as they come laden with alluvial matter collected along the Coromandel Coast, while in addition to this, as has already been pointed out, the land has been slowly rising from the sea, and terraces abounding in marine shells imbedded in agglutinated sand occur in situations far\n\n* Journal, C.B.R.A.S., 1880, p. 43.\nabove high water mark, and so the low sandy plains of Puttalam and Chilaw have been proportionally extended.\n\nBrodie writes:\n\nAll along the sea coast there are a series of horizontal beds of sandstone, never elevated more than a few feet above the present water level. The rock itself varies in structure and contains numerous enclosed shells and coral limes, apparently identical with species existing in the neighbouring island. The shells in many cases retain the enamel, and are in all respects as if they had just been washed into the sea. At Karativu, fourteen miles to the north, there are various strata of calcareous rock, some friable as marl, some highly indurated.*\n\nFrom Chilaw southwards, exposed during the prevalence of the north-east monsoon, is a breccia in process of formation from the agglutination of coral fragments and shells mixed with sand. \"Further north at M\u00e1damp\u00e9, between Chilaw and Negombo,\" says Tennent, \"the shells of the pearl oysters and other bivalves are turned up by the plough more than ten miles from the sea.\"\u2020 Again, \"at various points of the western coast, between the island of Mannar and Karativu, the natives, in addition to fishing for chank shells (Turbenella vapa) in the sea, dig them up in large quantities from beneath the soil on the adjacent shores, in which they are deeply imbedded.\"\u2021\n\nMr. Haly, the Director of the Colombo Museum, explored the coast opposite Karativu as far as Kudramalai point and collected interesting specimens of the formation, duplicates of which he sent to Berlin with a short account of the coast. The writer has been at some pains to obtain a copy of this account, as well as of the report thereon, which was solicited from the Berlin authorities, but without success. The specimens were\u2014\n\n(1) A kind of laterite, of which fragments that had fallen in the sea became hardened and acquired a polish, showing\n\n* Journal, C.B.R.A.S., No. 6, 1853.\n\u2020 Tennent's \"Ceylon,\" vol. I., p. 12.\n\u2021 Ibid, p. 20\nthe constituents of the rock clearly; (2) fragments of the upper part of some lofty limestone cliffs most peculiarly weathered\u2014the cliffs looking like coarse sandstone, but the application of acid revealing their true character; (3) fossil shells, all of the same species, from the base of these cliffs; (4) specimens of the limestone as it crops up through the beach; (5) specimens of the raised beach a few feet above sea level\u2014a conglomerate of recent shells and corals; (6) specimens of shells from the forest soil resting on this raised beach, which is in some parts more than 10 ft. in thickness and full of shells of the same species as are now living on the surface; (7) specimens of the same soil hardened by the action of the sea and again worn by exposure to the atmosphere; pottery and recent fresh-water shells sculptured out in the most delicate manner by the gradual wearing away of the hardened earth; numerous specimens of recent marine shells found in the lower part of the forest soil, and quantities of shells mixed with pottery, showing that a pearl fishery existed here in very ancient times.\n\nThe decomposition of Gneiss and its Products.\u2014Although our rocks are destitute of the interest which the presence of fossils would undoubtedly impart to their study, yet the absence of these organic remains is in a way compensated for by the deeply interesting study afforded by that great geological feature of the Island\u2014gneiss, with the various new forms arising from its disintegration. It is no doubt a matter of difficulty for one to comprehend how large mountain masses of hard gneissic rock could change so completely into laterite or moulder away into kaolin and lithomargic clays and finally assume the form of soil. To account for this wonderful transition and mutation under mechanical and chemical influences, we may here inquire into the main constituents of our chief rock, which comprise, according to \"Jamieson's Journal,\" the most common forms of the following minerals:\u2014\nFelspar. Mica. Hornblende.\n\nSilica ... 66\u00b775 ... 48\u00b700 ... 42\u00b700\nAlumina ... 17\u00b750 ... 34\u00b725 ... 12\u00b700\nLime ... 1\u00b705 ... \u2014 ... 11\u00b700\nPotash ... 12\u00b700 ... 8\u00b775 ... A trace\nMagnesia ... \u2014 ... \u2014 ... 2\u00b725\nOxide of iron ... .75 ... .50 ... .25\nOxide of manganese \u2014 ... .50 ... .25\nWater ... \u2014 ... \u2014 ... .75\n\n98\u00b725 96\u00b700 98\u00b725\n\nQuartz consists of nearly pure silica, with a trace, however, of alumina acid, sometimes of iron.\n\nNone of the varieties which Kelaart classifies laterite or \"cabook\" into, namely, (1) Laterite properly so called, and distinguished as Quartzose; (2) Lithomargic Laterite; (3) Detrital; or (4) Laterite Gravel, is to be found in the Province in any shape whatsoever.\n\nClays.\n\nLithomarge, which takes its place, is of frequent occurrence. According to Kelaart it is\u2014\n\nA sectile clayey substance of variegated colours. It is chiefly formed of a decomposed felspar and hornblende, whitish when the former prevails, and yellow or reddish when hornblende predominates in the rock from which it is derived, owing to the larger proportion of oxide of iron which the latter mineral contains.*\n\nFrom the list of mineral constituents which enter into the composition of gneiss, it will be seen that felspar and mica contain the largest amount of alumina, the principal ingredient in the formation of clay. In rocks in which felspar and hornblende predominate the clay formed is much variegated. Pure felspar forms kaolin. It is not, as is popularly thought, the \"kiri-meti\" of the natives. Kiri-meti, literally \"milk clay,\" is a species of potters' clay, and is largely used for pottery. A yellow species of it is used for washing walls. On the other hand, \"makul\" is the\n\n* Journal, C.B.R.A.S., vol. II., No. 5, pp. 210, 211.\npurest form of clay to be found in the Province, and is identical with kaolin or Chinese clay. It is found in abundance at Polgahawela, Alawwa, and W\u00e9uda, in the Kurun\u00e9gala District, and is commonly used in place of lime for whitewashing the laths and rafters and ceilings of houses. Lime does not adhere so firmly, and even when carefully put on drops away in flakes after a time. Makul sticks fast, and it is much easier to wash a roof or ceiling with it than with chunam, which often drops into the eye and causes much inconvenience.\n\nPotters' clay is an abundant substance, but there is a great difference in the nature and quality of it, found in various localities.\n\nBrick clay of a superior kind is met with at Malpi\u1e6diya, three miles from Kurun\u00e9gala on the road to Polgahawela. The brick fields here supplied a large proportion of the bricks to the railway for the construction of bridges, culverts, &c., and Mr. Waring, the Chief Resident Engineer of Railways, considered the material as good as, if not superior to, that supplied by the metropolis. As pointed out by Mr. Cochran, the quality of brick clay may be regarded as superior according as its composition approximates to that of kaolin.\n\nA stratum of very brackish clay underlies nearly the whole of the Puttalam District and part of the Demala hatpattu. The brackish stratum was probably the bed of a large lagoon, similar to the Puttalam lake. In the Puttalam District it is near the surface, in the Demala pattu it is at some depth. Fresh water is found only in the generally shallow surface formations locally known as villus; once the clay is pierced through the water is brackish, which, however acceptable to deer, sheep, and other animals, is not fit for human consumption.\n\nMr. J. G. Drieberg, the District Engineer of Puttalam, sent me in February, 1897, some specimens of this clay, and wrote that it\u2014\nwas found 42 ft. below ground level in a consolidated stratum. The pieces sent you were cut out with a penknife, so tough is the material. A cross-section of the surface, as it appeared in the rock-cutting, presented a smooth surface with a varying tint. The effect was pretty in the extreme. The rock was dug at Wannattivillu, 12 miles from Puttal\u0101m on the North road to Mann\u0101r. The soil above the clay as sent is ordinary black clay, anything but tenacious, and presenting a remarkable contrast to the former. The different layers are sharply defined. The rock itself is situated on the upper high water level of a villu. Villus are (as no doubt you are aware) natural depressions, generally circular, with mildly shelving banks and fringed with tall forest trees. A bit out of my district, in a place called Kokari, there is a succession of villus\u2014quite a chain of them, five in number. The first villu is an enormous sheet of water, and saltish. Tradition says that there is an underground channel connecting it with the sea. The next villu is called \"nalla-tanni-kulam,\" and the water is pure and sweet.\n\nCasie Chitty, writing of \"Quiparawa, a small lake on the east side of Kattakadoo,\" in the Puttal\u0101m District, says:\n\nThe bottom is a blue clay, and a person once jumping into it, and coming out covered with this mud up to the knees, obtained for it the name of \"Blue Boots,\" by which it is now universally known among Europeans.*\n\nSOIL.\n\nThe soil of this Province may be generally described as consisting of the results of \"the disintegration of the gneiss, detritus from the hills, alluvium carried down the rivers, and marine deposits gradually collected on the shore.\"\n\nThe greater portion of the soil of the maritime districts of Chilaw and Puttal\u0101m is a silicious sand, in which the principal ingredients are quartz in the shape of sand or gravel, decomposed felspar in the shape of clay, with more or less oxide of iron. Dr. Davy found this soil to consist of 98\u00b75 silicious sand. Here and there are to be found interspersed black paddy-field earth, potters' clay, or recent marl. Where granite rocks exist a reddish loam occurs, and on the margin of rivers and lakes a rich black mould, well adapted for paddy cultivation, is met with. Deep silt\n\n* \"Ceylon Gazetteer,\" p. 199.\noccurs along the shores of the sea and of creeks. In some places a retentive clay exists, and is used in the manufacture of bricks and tiles.\n\n**PEATY DEPOSITS.**\n\nThe only carbonaceous formations, apart from plumbago, which is dealt with under the head of \"Minerals,\" are the peaty deposits in the Kurun\u00e9gala District.\n\nThe tanks in the Kurun\u00e9gala District, chiefly those at Kurun\u00e9gala, Wenaruw\u00ebwa, and Tittawela, are covered with floating masses of vegetation of varying sizes and from 2 to 6 ft. in thickness, which are interesting from a geological point of view. It is believed that this is the only provincial division in the Island in which they occur. A large portion of the surface, nearly a fourth of the Kurun\u00e9gala tank, which is about 104 acres in extent, is covered with this floating vegetation, about 6 ft. in depth in some places and of greater depth in other places, possibly identical with what is known in Ireland as the \"old widow's tow.\" This mass is a veritable eyesore, and completely takes away from the effect, both from a picturesque as well as a sanitary point of view, of what has not been inappropriately termed \"the lungs of the town.\" Various schemes have been at different times proposed and tried for getting rid of this mass and many attempts made to remove it, but with very little success.\n\nThe floating mass may be divided into three parts. The first is a compact mass, and supports a growth of tank vegetation. The second consists of fibrous roots only, and forms the connecting link between the crust or the first part and the third, which is composed of slushy matter, the vegetable substance being more decomposed, to which it is attached. There is water between this part and the bottom of the tank, with which it is apparently unconnected. The crust is composed of fibrous roots, stems, and partly decayed leaves of grasses and sedges and a variety of aquatic plants. When cut vertically the peat appears stratified with each year's growth, and is evidently the result of many years'\naccumulation. Professor Morris, the Assistant Director of the Royal Gardens at Kew, when Assistant Director of the Royal Botanical Gardens at P\u00e9r\u00e1deniya, on a visit to Kurun\u00e9gala in 1878 on the orders of the Ceylon Government, could not identify the most important plant which enters largely into the floating mass, as it was not sufficiently grown to enable him to do so. He identified among the grasses *Panicum myurus*, *Panicum interruptum*, and members of the *Carex* and *Cyperus* families. The matted growth of these are mixed with *Ceratophyllum*, *Polygonum*, *Zinnophila*, *Marsila*, and *Utricularia*. During the dry weather most of the grasses and sedges wither, and their dead leaves accumulating around the floating stems, at times 20 to 30 ft. long, serve to increase periodically the size of the mass and to gather around them the fine mud and other deposits brought in by the rains.*\n\nDr. Morris found the residual ashes obtained by burning the peat rich in potash and other salts, and, mixed with soil he thought they ought to prove a useful manure for estates and gardens. Mr. Drieberg, the Superintendent of the Agricultural School, Colombo, to whom the writer forwarded three cases of specimens, reported as follows:\n\n- Specimen of case No. 1 contained 6 per cent.\n- Specimen of case No. 2 contained 13 per cent.\n- Specimen of case No. 3 contained 10 per cent.\n\nMr. Drieberg observed that, unless in the neighbourhood of the deposits, there was no special value to be attached to peat as an organic manure for mixing with poor soils, or the ash got from it on account of the potash and other mineral ingredients it contains; it had no great advantage over ordinary organic refuse on the one hand or wood ashes on the other.\n\n---\n\n* The chief characteristics exhibited by a section of workable peat moss, and referred to by Professor James Geikie, F.R.S., in a Paper \"On the Buried Forests and Peat Mosses of Scotland, and the Changes of Climate which they indicate\" (Trans. R. S. Edin., vol. XXIV., 1867), are strikingly identical with the above description.\nThe peat to be met with in this Province is of recent origin\u2014old peat deposits, some of which date back to the glacial period, apparently do not occur in the Island\u2014and the conditions which favour its formation locally are restricted to limited areas. \"The question therefore,\" says Mr. Drieberg, in reply to the writer's inquiry, \"as to the availability of peat for fuel purposes practically does not affect us, but there are other economic uses for which such local and limited supplies of peat\u2014if, indeed, it would be wise to encourage its formation\u2014may be available. Owing to its absorbent properties, it is a useful medium for absorbing liquid manure, &c. Peat moss litter, as exported from Germany, is in fact largely used in England in byres and stakes, while it is also a very effective deodorizer.\"*\n\nDr. H. M. Fernando, the Government Analyst, Colombo, to whom a sample of the Kurun\u00e9gala tank water was sent for analysis by the writer in December, 1896, in kindly furnishing the following report, added in a note:\n\nThe tank water is highly impregnated with vegetable matter, and should be looked upon with great suspicion, especially in a fever district.\n\nColour, slight yellow. Smell, foetid. Taste, unpleasant. Sediment, slight sediment containing infusoria and protozoa. Chloride grains per gallon, '3 grain. Nitrates, trace. Saline ammonia, parts per million '01. Albumenoid ammonia, parts per million '24.\n\nRemarks.\u2014This sample contains a large proportion of organic matter, probably of vegetable origin. Unfit for drinking purposes.\n\nMETALS.\n\nWe know little or nothing of the metaliferous nature of our rocks, for beyond the investigations of Gygax in 1847, which were confined to the hill district south of Adam's Peak, and his report, which scarcely enlarged the knowledge previously possessed by us on the subject, no examination has been made of the veins and deposits of our rocks.\n\n* For a full description of the \"Peaty Deposits in the Kurun\u00e9gala Lake,\" and the steps taken to remove them, see an article by the writer in the \"Ceylon Agricultural Magazine,\" 1896.\nGold.\u2014However slight may be the proof afforded by such names as Randenigama, Randeniya, Rangalapola, Rangama, Ranmutugala, Rantetikanda, Rantetiy\u00e1wa, &c., which are said to derive their origin from the existence of auriferous ores in these places, and the doubtful testimony furnished by \"Wadula-pot,\" which relate in glowing terms of fabulous wealth and countless treasures buried deep in the bowels of the earth seldom accessible to man (!), the theory that gold is an unknown quantity in the Island has been falsified by explorations in this Province. Davy in his work made the unqualified averment that the precious metals were not to be found in Ceylon. Commenting on this statement, \"it is amusing,\" says Sir Samuel Baker, \"to see the positive assertions of a clever man upset by a few uneducated sailors.\"* In March, 1854, seven discharged seamen from the \"Faithful\" and the \"Martin Luther,\" namely, Henry Temple, William King, Charles Langley, James Mabley, John Wilson, John Philips, and William Bradley, with experience of gold-digging in California and Australia, touched at Colombo and made a trip towards Kandy by the old road. When about half way it struck them, from the appearance of the rocks in the uneven bed of the Mah\u00e1-oya, that gold must exist in the sands. They had no geological reasons for this opinion, but the river happened to be very like those in California in which they had been accustomed to find gold. They accordingly set to work with a tin pan to wash the sand, and, as Baker exultingly records, \"to the astonishment of every one in Ceylon, and to the confusion of Dr. Davy's opinions, they actually discovered gold!\" The scene of the operations, called \"Bradley's Diggings\" after the original discoverer, lay at Giriulla, 25 miles from Kurun\u00e9gala, in a sudden bend of the Mah\u00e1-oya from a south-westerly to a north-westerly course. In the centre of the bed stood an island composed of \"diluvial\" deposits of smooth gneiss, quartz boulders, sand, and gravel, cemented\n\n* \"Eight Years in Ceylon,\" second edition, p. 49.\ntogether by a reddish clay. The natives said that this island formed part of the mainland, whence it was severed by the heavy floods of 1838. The pit from which the seamen washed the deposit was in the upper part of the island, which divided the stream into two parts during the monsoon. The deposit was from 2 to 3 ft. deep to the solid rock bottom, 300 ft. long, and 70 ft. broad. The gold was distributed throughout the island, but was more abundant in the rock crevices. The specimen submitted for examination to Dr. Ellery, according to his report\u2014\n\nweighed $7\\frac{1}{2}$ grains, and consisted of small pieces of yellowish quartz, a black powder resembling coarse emery, and several scales of yellow metallic-looking substance. The application of a magnetic ore separated about one-third of the black powder, which consisted of magnetic ore. One-half of the residue was acted upon by boiling in nitric acid without effect; the addition of muriatic acid dissolved the metal, yielding a golden yellow solution. This, on the addition of the subjoined tests, afforded the following results:\n\nNo. 1.\u2014Chloride of tin gave a copious deep purple precipitate.\n\nNo. 2.\u2014Solution of sulphate of iron, a dark-brown looking precipitate of metallic gold.\n\nNo. 3.\u2014A very weak solution of tincture of opium gave a bright yellow transparent fluid.\n\nDr. Ellery was of opinion, from the appearance of the specimen and from the result of the chemical examination, that it certainly contained gold.\n\nThe discovery of gold created a regular furor. Crowds of enterprising speculators and inquisitive visitors rushed daily to the diggings for purposes of prospecting for gold or witnessing the operations. Thereupon Government, with more haste than discretion, issued a notice that the Superintendent of Police (Macartney) had received instructions \"not to allow any persons to dig, excavate, or to carry on any mining operations under whatever name or pretext, with the exception of the seven individuals already engaged with the cognizance of Government, and of any other that may hereafter be especially licensed for that purpose.\"\n\nFour days afterward, to wit, on the 17th of March, 1854, a second Government Proclamation was published, informing\nthe public that the Governor (Sir George Anderson) was pleased to appoint T. C. Power, Esq., Assistant Government Agent of Kurun\u00e9gala, to be \"Special Commissioner for the issue of licenses to dig, search for, and remove gold on any land belonging to the Crown.\" A fee of ten shillings was to be charged for every such license, which was to remain in force for one month from the date of issue. These notifications were manifestly too premature, and no wonder that not one single license was applied for!\n\nIn addition to the Gold Commissioner and the Superintendent of Police, a posse of the local constabulary and a section of the Ceylon Rifles were stationed at the \"diggings,\" which, from being the undisturbed haunt of the alligator, at once rose from its primeval solitude into a busy and \"fashionable watering-place!\" A piece of gold was produced before Mr. Power by a headman, who reported to have found it at Dambadeniya, eight miles above the \"diggings.\" Dr. Ellery pronounced the gold to be without alloy.\n\nThe quantity produced at the \"diggings\" was, however, small, but the diggers were sanguine of success, and were making preparations for working on a more extensive scale, when a combination of adverse circumstances, chief among them being violent thunderstorms, floods, and jungle fever, conspired towards the abandonment of the enterprise. Curiously enough the neighbourhood of the \"diggings\" was the spot where Davy closed his series of journeyings in the interior, one of the results of which, he declared with a show of scientific authority, was, that no gold existed in Ceylon!\n\nIn 1881 Mr. A. C. Dixon\u2014\n\n\"met with gold in scattered grains, free by natural causes from its matrix, in the alluvium of the D\u00e9duru-oya beyond Kurun\u00e9gala. The particles were exceedingly small, and other metallic matters were not uncommon. This must have come from the quartz reef further up the hills.\"\n\n* \"Gold in Ceylon,\" Journal, C.B.R.A.S., 1881.\nIn the same year the late S. Jayatilleke, Mudaliyar, of Kurun\u00e9gala, submitted for analysis some interesting specimens of quartz and plumbago streaked with auriferous-looking substances found in that district. The streak of green glittering matter in the plumbago was reported to be copper, while the quartz was freely mixed with pyrites, but of a very promising character, and in one instance Mr. Dixon thought it must be auriferous.*\n\n*Mica mistaken for Gold Dust.\u2014Col. Campbell records the following interesting discovery in the Kurun\u00e9gala District, but the particulars are too vague to identify the spot:\n\nAfter nearly an hour spent in search of it [the fairy well] I at last came to an open space of fine green sward close to the bank of the river, which was there delightfully shaded by some tall trees, in the midst of which was a circle of about seven or eight feet in diameter, entirely covered with a brightly shining foliated substance of a red and yellow hue; and in the very middle of it, to my surprise and delight, I saw a beautiful diminutive jet d\u2019eau, throwing up water of the same bright, shining colour, fully three or four inches above the surface, and which fell as it were in a circle of little sparkling drops. I stood for some minutes really enchanted with the beauty of the extraordinary fairy well, the water of which seemed full of gold particles. I therefore set to work and strained out a small quantity of them, pouring the water through my handkerchief, when to my increased delight they looked \u201cfor all the world\u201d like real gold dust.\n\nCampbell filled a quart bottle with some of the \u201cgolden\u201d water and despatched it with a very small quantity of the dust to Dr. Farrell, the Deputy Inspector of Hospitals, whose opinion was that it was \u201conly the very finest specimen of mica he had ever met with.\u201d\u2020\n\nAll that has been said and written about the existence of gold in the Province and the results of explorations hitherto made point to but one conclusion, that though gold is to be found, it is not to be met with in sufficiently paying quantities so as to encourage the capitalist to embark on the venture.\n\n* Ferguson\u2019s \u201cAll about Gold, Gems, and Pearls,\u201d second edition, p. 179.\n\u2020 \u201cExcursions, Adventures, and Field Sports in Ceylon,\u201d vol. II., pp. 114, 115.\nSilver.\u2014Tradition says that when King Dutugemunu was engaged in constructing some important public works he ran short of funds, and in order to avoid his labourers who were clamouring for their wages, he fled into the jungle. Here he chanced upon a vein of silver, which supplied him with ample means to satisfy his pecuniary wants. In grateful remembrance of the miraculously opportune and fortuitous discovery, he is said to have built over the site of the vein what is known as \"Ridi Vih\u00e1r\u00e9\"\u2014the silver temple\u2014eleven miles from Kurun\u00e9gala, and endowed it with extensive property. The \"Kadaim-pota\" records that in the D\u00e9wamedirata\u2014the country so called from its situation between two rivers, the D\u00e9duru and Mi oyas, and corresponding in some measure to the modern D\u00e9wamedi-hat-pattu of the Kurun\u00e9gala District, which, however, owing to its altered boundaries does not embrace the whole of the division included by these rivers\u2014there is silver to be found in a cave.\n\nIron exists in different forms, and is pretty generally distributed. It is chiefly met with in the following species: Iron pyrites, hematite, and bog-iron. \"The only ore heard of,\" says Brodie, writing of the Puttalam and Chilaw Districts, \"is bog-iron, procured in considerable quantities a few miles to the south of Chilaw and smelted by the natives, who, it appears, observed its reproduction.\"*\n\nCasie Chitty observes that Y\u00e1gam pattu \"abounds in iron ore, and derives its name from that circumstance.\"\u2020\n\nThere are numerous caves and vast caverns in the Crown forest known as Penirendawa in the Chilaw District, from which the natives assert iron was dug out in the olden days. These abandoned recesses afford a secure rendezvous to runaway criminals, who take shelter in them to evade justice. In October, 1896, these caves were searched as likely places for the Chilaw murderers who had escaped from jail, but without success, the stay of the fugitives there having been very short.\n\n* Journal, C.B.R.A.S., No. 6, 1853. \u2020 \"Ceylon Gazetteer,\" p. 223.\nAs testified by Tennent, \"remains of ancient furnaces are met with in all directions similar to those still in use amongst the natives. The Sinhalese obtain the ore without the trouble of mining: seeking a spot where the soil has been loosened by the rains, they break off a sufficient quantity, which in less than three hours they convert into iron by the simplest possible means. None of their furnaces are capable of smelting more than twenty pounds of ore, and yet this quantity yields from seven to ten pounds of good metal.\"* Since, however, the imported article is so cheap and certainly superior to that locally obtained, smelting may be considered as an operation which is numbered with the past.\n\n**MINERALS.**\n\n*Plumbago* is the only mineral of commercial value and importance. It is found principally in the Kurun\u00e9gala District. As a medicinal ingredient plumbago takes a prominent place in the Sinhalese pharmacopoeia, and in the ceramic art it was used largely for glazing purposes, from which we may argue that it was known to the natives for a long time past; but from a commercial standpoint plumbago mining may be considered as of comparatively recent origin, having been started early in the \"seventies\" in the Kurun\u00e9gala District.\u2020\n\n---\n\n* \"Ceylon,\" vol. I., p. 30.\n\n\u2020 Col. Colebrooke, one of the Commissioners of Ceylon affairs, stated in his report in 1829 that provision had been made for the delivery of cinnamon and blacklead in the Kandyan Provinces (which included the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s or Kurun\u00e9gala District) at fixed rates; but reference to the \"Ceylon Calendars\" shows no mention of plumbago in the Island till 1831. It assumed importance as an article of commerce in 1834. Mr. Parsons, Government Agent of the North-Western Province, wrote in 1870: \"The question of plumbago-digging is one of great importance, and anxiously looked forward to by the residents as well as those who desire to dig for it. The delay in the matter is greatly to be regretted. It was brought to notice many months ago and, I believe, referred to the Queen's Advocate, but no decision has yet been arrived at.\"\u2014Administration Reports, 1870. Plumbago is spoken of in 1875 as having been found at Mipi\u1e6diya, about 18 miles from Kurun\u00e9gala, as if the discovery had been made recently.\u2014Administration Reports, North-Western Province, 1875.\nThe chief seat of the industry lies within a radius of about six miles between the road from Kurun\u00e9gala to Dambulla and the M\u00e1tal\u00e9 range of hills. The plumbago-producing villages are Paragoda, Madur\u00e1goda, Udatt\u00e1pola, M\u00edpi\u1e6diya, R\u00e1gedara, Udakendawela, and Dodangaslanda. Plumbago was reported to have been discovered on the road to Negombo, south-west of Kurun\u00e9gala, and at Naramana, on the road to Balalla, 18 miles north of Kurun\u00e9gala. The \"Blue Book\" for 1892 gives Nalaulla and Nakkawatta in addition to the above villages. Operations are carried on here on a small scale.*\n\nThe following is a list prepared at the Kurun\u00e9gala Kachcheri of some of the pits, with the locality in which they lie, and name of owner:\n\n**Paragoda, in M\u00e1dur\u00e9 K\u00f3ral\u00e9.**\n\n| Pit Name                  | Owner                      |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| S\u00fariyagaha-patala         | N.

Here is just the case where a Government geologist might afford valuable aid in developing a most important industry, and be able to point out with much confidence to undeveloped Crown lands likely to prove of great value for their beds of plumbago, while his advice to private proprietors might save much time and money in trial pits, surface diggings, and generally useless and vain exploration.\n\nThe usual mode of setting to work when there are signs, which to the knowing ones prognosticate a find of plumbago sooner or later, is to drive a shaft (miniran patala), say 12 ft. by 6 ft., until the mineral is reached, failing which galleries are run (don\u00e1 kepima) till a vein is found, and the vein is followed downwards and horizontally so long as it is possible to contend with the flow of water in the mine. Operations are then stopped and galleries driven, and this goes on while the lamps burn; but the moment the lamps are extinguished by the gases collected in the galleries, working in that part is suspended and resumed upwards, the abandoned portions being re-filled with the d\u00e9bris from the mine. In other cases, instead of sinking a shaft a large open cutting is made, in which the vein is followed and galleries run as occasion may require. Slightly improved methods have from time to time been employed, but the old order of things\nremains, the pit owners being painfully conservative. When rock is encountered in the course of excavation it is blasted by means of dynamite. It is in the blasting operations that most of the accidents occur, chiefly through carelessness. The report, by the way, caused by the explosion, sounds at the mouth of the pits at R\u00e1gedara like that produced by a cracker, but at Gokarella, which is two miles thence, and perhaps on a level with the bottom of the pits, the full effect of it is heard.\n\nPlumbago does not occur in even or regular beds, but varies in thickness, both vertically and horizontally. It may occasionally be more than a fathom thick, but thinning out very often to a few inches in all directions. Very good plumbago is often found near the surface, but as a general rule the lower the digging operations go the better the quality and the larger the quantity of mineral.\n\nThe principal pits are at a distance of between 12 to 16 miles north-east of Kurun\u00e9gala on a small range of hills known as M\u00edpi\u1e6diya-kanda, about three miles long and about a mile to the west of the N\u0113vugala range, 3,000 to 4,000 ft. high, and almost parallel to it. The major axis of the M\u00edpi\u1e6diya range runs, as in the case of the M\u00e1tal\u00e9 hills, north and south. The pits are being worked at M\u00edpi\u1e6diya, which is at the southern end, and at R\u00e1gedara, at the northern end of the range. Parag\u014d\u1e0da and Madur\u00e1g\u014d\u1e0da lie about ten miles farther south, and are approached from W\u0113uda, eleven miles from Kurun\u00e9gala on the road to Kandy.\n\nThe general strike of the veins or bed of plumbago in the M\u00edpi\u1e6diya range is east and west, nearly vertical in position. The general direction of the \"underlie\" in the R\u00e1gedara beds is south-east and in the M\u00edpi\u1e6diya beds north.\n\nThe late Mr. A. M. Ferguson writes:\n\nThe R\u00e1gedara hill seems to be permeated in its whole extent by generally horizontal veins of the richest plumbago, associated with snow white crystalline to semi-opaque quartz, the latter occasionally showing specks of garnet and bands of soapstone.\nWhen His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales was in Colombo in 1870, Mr. De Mel exhibited from Kurun\u00e9gala what was supposed to be the largest mass of pure plumbago ever shown in this or any other country, its weight being only 14 lb. short of 6 cwt. For this unique specimen a sum of \u00a350 was offered. It was subsequently sent to the United States, and is understood to have been placed in the Philadelphia Exhibition and finally in an American Museum.\n\nAs regards the generality of pits, Mr. Ferguson estimated\u2014the extraneous matter in the shape of heart and rock brought to the pit's mouth as equal to a half, about 10 or 15 per cent. being the proportion carried to Colombo and separated from the ore in the plumbago yards. The estimate of Mr. W. P. Fernando, an experienced plumbago merchant, of foreign matter brought to Colombo is 5 per cent. for pieces of quartz round which plumbago adheres and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. for minute fragments of silica, iron, &c., mixed with smaller pieces and dust.\n\nPlumbago occurs in various different forms. Dana enumerates\u2014\n\n(a) Foliated.\n(b) Columnar and sometimes radiated.\n(c) Scaly, massive, and slaty.\n(d) Granular massive.\n(e) Earthy, amorphous, without metallic lustre, except in the streak.\n(f) In radiated concretions.\n\nCommercially plumbago is divided into (1) lumps, (2) chips, and (3) dust; and distributed into three classes: (1) foliated, laminated; (2) hard, short-grained, and dull-looking; (3) slaty, hard and stony, with about 30 per cent. of clay in it, termed by the natives \"bora.\"\n\nAgain, it is distinguished, for trading purposes, into various qualities, such as\u2014\n\n(1) X : best.\n(2) X b : second best.\n(3) B.\n(4) B E.\n(5) E.\n(6) S I O.\n\nBison\nPalm\nCobra\nManx\n\nThese are private marks.\n\nIn the following analyses by Mr. C. Mene, reproduced by\nCochran from Dana's \"Mineralogy,\" Ceylon plumbago does not appear to the best advantage, being in all probability not represented by a very good local sample:\n\n|                      | Specific Gravity | Carbon | Volatile Matter | Ash |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------|-----------------|-----|\n| Ural, Mt.

Murray of the Public Works Department, and will be found as an Appendix to Mr. Ferguson\u2019s \u201cMonograph on Plumbago.\u201d\n\nOf the minerals dug out of plumbago mines, there are a number which doubtless have some value, but with which the natives have no acquaintance, and consequently they are sometimes thrown away. Amongst these minerals may be enumerated pyrrhotite,\u2021 from which the nickel of commerce\n\n* American paper.\n\n\u2020 Ferguson\u2019s \u201cPlumbago,\u201d &c., p. 237.\n\n\u2021 Mr. C. E. Ferdinands, of Kurun\u00e9gala, who has a share in the Huri-golla and other mines, sent a specimen of this mineral to his London agents, who reported that iron pyrites were used to make sulphuric acid, but at that time, nine years ago, they had no commercial value. The specific gravity of this ore is almost the same as that of gold. It does not dissolve in nitro-hydrochloric acid. It was put to the test.\nis extracted, but whether it is nickeliferous in Ceylon it is difficult to say. *Steatite* or soapstone, which, if it occurs in masses, might be worked into ornaments, plates, cups, and saucers as in Bengal. *Magnetite* (*feroso-feno oxide*), showing strong polarity, and which may perhaps be found to be a richer ore of iron than the \"black sea sand\" of the coast, which experts thought some five and twenty years ago could not be remuneratively worked. *Chalcopyrite*, containing such rare elements as columbian or niobium and yttrium, zirconium, mica, gold, and numberless other minerals.\n\nIf these metals and minerals which are found in association with plumbago occur to any appreciable or rather workable extent, how many valuable additions might we not have to our local arts and manufactures, and even to our exports; and may be, some day we shall hear of metallurgical operations in the Island, and of gold, nickel, and manganese and iron being extracted from their ores!\n\n**GEMS.**\n\nBeyond the garnets and amethysts* which are common in the gneiss, cinnamon stone, which is properly a variety of the former, rock crystal, and tourmaline, and a number of others of no great value, this Province is sadly deficient in gems.\n\n**SALTS.**\n\n*Nitre Caves.* \u2014 Davy enumerates the following places in this Province in which saltpetre is produced and in which it has been manufactured. The names are said to be\u2014\n\nnot those of the nitre caves themselves, which are generally nameless, but of the nearest inhabited places, which are in many instances several miles remote, most of the caves being situated in the wildest and most deserted parts of the country:\n\n---\n\n* Davy found \"very beautiful specimens of this mineral in the alluvium derived from the decomposition of gneiss and granitic rock in Saffragam and the Seven Korles\"\u2014Page 20.\n1.

I have never been able to detect saltpetre, excepting superficially, where air could have access; never unaccompanied by nitrate of lime or magnesia; in no rock, not containing lime or felspar; that the richness of the rock in general has been proportional to the abundance and intimate mixture of these two ingredients.\u00a7\n\nOf the Puttal\u00e1m and Chilaw Districts, Brodie observes:\u2014\n\nNitre used at one time to be procured from various caves. One of these I visited, and have reason to believe that the salt was not formed naturally, but it was obtained artificially from the dung of countless bats which have their abode in the grotto.\u00a7\n\nThe process of preparing the salt is thus detailed:\u2014\n\nWhen the salt occurred, impregnating the surface of the rock, the surface was chipped off with small strong axes, and the chippings by pounding were reduced to the state of a powder. This powder, or the loose fine earth, which in most of the caves contained the saline\n\n---\n\n* Casie Chitty confirms the statement, and says that at the base of the hill Parama-kanda there is a cave from which the natives formerly obtained saltpetre.\u2014\"Ceylon Gazetteer,\" p. 183.\n\n\u2020 In Nikawagampaha k\u00f3ral\u00e9, Hiriy\u00e1la hatpattu.\n\n\u2021 \"Ceylon,\" pp. 31\u201332.\n\n\u00a7 Journal, C.B.R.A.S., No. 6, 1853.\nimpregnation, was well mixed with an equal quantity of wood ash.* The mixture was thrown on a filter formed of matting and washed with cold water. The washings of the earth were collected in an earthen vessel, and evaporated at a boiling temperature till concentrated to that degree that a drop let fall on a leaf became a soft solid. The concentrated solution was set aside, and when it had crystallized the whole was put on a filter of mat. The mother-lye that passed through, still rich in saltpetre, was added to a fresh weak solution, to be evaporated again; and the crystals after having been examined and freed from any other crystals of a different form were either immediately dried, or, if not sufficiently pure, re-dissolved and crystallized afresh. The operations just described were generally carried on at the nitre caves. In the Province of Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, besides extracting the salt at the caves, the workmen brought a quantity of the earth to their houses, where, keeping it under a shed protected from the wind and rain, without any addition excepting a little wood-ash, they obtained from it, every third year, a fresh quantity of salt. After twenty-one years, or seven repetitions of the operation, the earth was considered unfit for further use, and was thrown away.\u2020\n\nDavy says that since the British occupation the manufacture was stopped, and thereafter, on account of political motives, prohibited.\n\nSalt (chloride of sodium) is procured in large quantities in the Puttal\u00e1m District by solar evaporation, and, indeed, forms the chief source of its revenue. The greater portion of it is obtained by means of artificial pans, and the manufacture is carried on exclusively in Puttal\u00e1m proper, Nachchikali, and Karativu. It is spontaneously formed near Kalpi\u0163iya during the dry season, at Chilaw, and generally along the sea coast. Salt used to be manufactured\u2014\n\nin the vicinity of the Mundle lake, viz., Odepankarre, Pulichakolem, and Keriankally; the attempt to prepare it near Chilaw has always failed. * * * The quantity produced is about 50,000 bushels.\n\n* Such a quantity must appear very large; but I do not believe it is more than is required to decompose the whole of the nitrate of lime that accompanies the saltpetre. The proportion of alkali in the ash of large trees in Ceylon, which are usually burnt for the purpose in question, is very small: in one specimen that I examined I found only three and a half per cent. of carbonate of potash; carbonate of lime was the principal ingredient.\n\n\u2020 Davy's \"Ceylon,\" pp. 265\u2013267.\nThe average quantity sold to retailers annually is about 10,000 bushels, which yield a revenue of \u00a31,333. 6s. 8d. The average cost of every bushel to Government is about 6\u00bdd., whilst it is retailed at the uniform rate of 2s. 6d. per bushel. The entire operation is left to private enterprise, with only a Government supervision to prevent any contraband trade.*\n\nThe salt collected in the North-Western Province varies in colour from pure white to dull gray or reddish, according to the impurities contained in it; it appears in the form of a confused crystalline mass, consisting of hollow quadrilateral pyramids with graduated surfaces (pied de mouche) and of cubes. The large grained salt is generally preferred, as it does not absorb moisture from the atmosphere so rapidly as that which is in smaller crystals. It is to be observed that the former is obtained in the first crop, the latter in those which succeed; and no one can feel astonished that these latter should prove impure, when it is remembered that all except the first crops are procured from a mixture of sea water with the previously obtained residuary solution of various limes and magnesia salts. The natives have observed the difference in appearance of the various salts procured at the different crops, but do not seem to be aware that a most impure article is obtained by mixing all together.\u2020\n\nWhen the Dutch held sway in the Island the manufacture of salt was left in the hands of the natives, who were, however, bound to give a certain portion of the produce to the various officials under the name of m\u00e9sai uppu or \"table salt.\" The price at that time varied from three to four-eighths of a penny per bushel. Under the English rule the manufacture is a Government monopoly. Although it is left to private parties they are prohibited from selling or using it. Government use to buy the salt at the fixed rate of 2\u00bdd. per bushel from the purchaser and sell it at 2s. 8d. per bushel. The present rates are 19 cents per cwt., and the Crown in its turn disposes of it at the rate of Rs. 2\u00b736 per cwt.\n\nThe modus operandi adopted in the manufacture is as simple as it is unique. Unlike the natural lewayas in the Hambanto\u1e6da District, the salt pans have to be prepared artificially after the manner of paddy fields.

Brodie gives the average size of a reservoir as 40 or 50 ft. square, that of a bed 15 to 20 ft. in length by 8 to 12 ft. in breadth; but no particular attention is paid to this. Water from the reservoir is then introduced into the pan by means of a canal (allei), and by smaller canals (p\u00e9rallei) into the various beds till crystallization occurs. Fresh quantities are from time to time let in as the crystallization goes on till the necessary depth of salt is formed.\n\nThe process commences in June and usually lasts till September. The salt is then collected and placed in heaps, and ultimately conveyed to the kottus or huts in which it is stored till handed over to, weighed, and received by the Government authorities into their stores. The construction of these stores has been the subject of much discussion and anxious thought and consideration. During the time of Brodie they were \"in some instances formed of cadjans, sometimes of masonry, and sometimes altogether of timber, and of these latter some were placed over pits four or five feet in depth, while others were raised on dwarf pillars to prevent injuries from water. The cadjan stores require constant repair and are seldom quite water-tight; the mortar of the masonry ones soon becomes disintegrated by the action of the salt, the timber stores over pits were found inconvenient and damp, those on pillars unnecessarily expensive, it being observed that white ants do not attack timber saturated with salt; plain wooden structures placed on somewhat elevated sites appear therefore the most suitable, and will probably be universally adopted.\"*\n\n* Journal, C.B.R.A.S., No. 3, 1847-48, p. 109.\nThe wastage caused by salt being stored in buildings such as these, none of which had the necessary qualification of being air-tight, was greatly diminished, if not altogether done away with, by the contrivance of a form of store suggested in 1886 by Dr. Modder of the Civil Medical Department, then stationed at Puttalam, namely, a vaulted store opening at one end only, and made as nearly air-tight as possible.*\n\nThe system in vogue is very crude and primitive, and is capable of much improvement. As pointed out by Brodie, *inter alia*:\n\nThe beds are formed either in a black silt or mud, or else, as at Sinne Natchecally, in a nearly pure sand; either of these substances is very easily disturbed and rendered uneven, which calls for renewed levelling and drying; were artificial beds of some more solid impervious substance formed, there would be less leakage of water and less labour would be requisite; even firmly beaten clay might prove useful, but has never been tried by the natives, and this owing to a belief that in such pans the water would evaporate very much more slowly; to me this appears to prove that at present there is a very considerable waste by filtration into the soil. Again, owing to a feeling of petty parsimony, the salt when placed in heaps is in the majority of cases left quite unprotected, and thus becomes not only coated, but also mixed with sand and other impurities; the kottoos are also by no means so impervious as would be desirable.\n\nLastly, it may be observed that the many valuable salts contained in the ley after the deposit has been formed are either quite lost, or are obtained intermingled with the wished-for product, which is consequently found to be exceedingly liable to deliquescence; but probably the extraction of these would prove too complicated a process to be conducted by the natives.\u2020\n\nConsidering the importance of the manufacture and the large returns it yields to Government, it is to be regretted that no person with a special scientific training should have yet been appointed to supervise the work and introduce improved methods such as are above indicated.\n\n* \"Administration Report of the North-Western Province (Puttalam District),\" p. 57 A.\n\n\u2020 \"On the Manufacture of Salt by Solar Evaporation, with special reference to the methods adopted in the Chilaw and Puttalam Districts of Ceylon,\" by A. O. Brodie.

Davy writes:\n\nIn the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s the water of Yapahove (Y\u00e1paahuwa) is said to effect cures in certain diseases; but a specimen of this water, for which I was indebted to the Rev. G. Bissett, did not contain anything in its composition to confirm such a character.\u2020\n\n4. Mr. J. Ferguson took the Chair.\n\n5. Mr. Ferguson remarked on the great industry and research which Mr. Modder\u2019s Paper showed, and on the interest with which all the many scattered essays, monographs, and compilations on the local Geology and Mineralogy are sure to be regarded by the officer who may take charge of the coming systematic Geological Survey of Ceylon. As regards plumbago mines, it is very interesting to know that the Singhalese, with their simple appliances, had sunk pits so deep as 1,500 ft. He, the speaker, had been down a Ballaarat gold mine thirty years ago, between 3,000 and 4,000 ft. deep; but these miners had the advantage of all engineering appliances. As regards laterite, it was a fact that some members of the Indian Geological Survey had recognized a laterite as old as the volcanic period, and as a formation distinct from gneiss, the most prevalent rock in India and Ceylon. Their Ceylon laterite, or cabook, however, is generally regarded as in a constant course of decay from the older rock; but curiously enough, a Colombo merchant (Mr. C. F. Alexander) twenty years ago read a Paper before the Geological Society of Edinburgh to demonstrate that Ceylon laterite was volcanic in its origin. Mr. Modder\u2019s account of the formation around Chilaw and M\u00e4damp\u00e9 would partly account for the richness of the soil well-known as one of the finest cocoanut-growing districts in the Island. As regards the reference to gold and other valuable metals, the expectation shared by Sir Samuel Baker, among others, was that a proper examination of the rocks in our higher divisions would lead to the discovery of gold-yielding quartz, as well as possibly to the matrix of some of our precious gems. But since Sir Samuel\u2019s last visit to the Island, when he had had the honour of a long conversation with him on the subject, they had had the railway carried right across their mountain system through many deep cuttings, and a large number of rock tunnels, but\n\n* Journal, C.B.R.A.S., No. 6, 1853.\n\u2020 Davy\u2019s \u201cCeylon,\u201d p. 48.\nwith no discovery of precious metals or stones. In conclusion he would remark on the statement by Mr. Modder that the Dutch left the manufacture and distribution of salt to the natives, who apparently sold it at a much lower price than at present prevailed. This would seem to upset the monopoly argument\u2014that salt is more cheaply and regularly distributed to all parts of the Island than it could be if left to private enterprise.\n\n6. Mr. Haly remarked with reference to the railway cuttings and the absence of gold, that Mr. Waring had told him that he had never before, in a wide experience of rock cutting, had to do with more ordinary road metal than in blasting through the many \u00dava railway tunnels; but he (Mr. Haly) had seen around Badulla town quartz boulders marked after a fashion which reminded him very much of a specimen of rich Australian gold-bearing quartz, which he had seen in the British Museum. He thought the Badulla quartz well worth testing.\n\n7. Mr. Ferguson remarked that though the \u00dava natives were well known to have smelted iron and to be keen about metals, yet he had no recollection of Sinhalese names in \u00dava indicating gold, as they had on the Kandy side in Rangalla, Rambo\u1e0da, Ruwanwella, &c. Dr. Davy, too, had made his observations around Badulla and Namunukula-kanda: still it would certainly be well to follow up Mr. Haly\u2019s hint.\n\n8. Mr. Haly read the following Paper:\u2014\nSOME ILLUSTRATIONS FROM THE FAUNA OF CEYLON OF WALLACE'S THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.\n\nBy A. Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum.\n\nLord Salisbury, in his address to the British Association at Oxford in 1894, said:\n\nIn Natural Selection what is to supply the breeder's place? There would be nothing but mere chance to secure that the advantageously varied bridegroom at one end of the wood should meet the bride, who, by happy contingency, had been advantageously varied in the same direction at the same time at the other end of the wood. It would be a mere chance if they ever knew of each other's existence. A still more unlikely chance that they should resist on both sides all temptation to a less advantageous alliance. But, unless they did so, the new breed would never even begin, let alone the question of its perpetuation after it had begun.\n\nLast September Professor E. B. Poulton pointed out in his address to the Zoological Section of the British Association at Liverpool that\u2014\n\nthe theory of Natural Selection, as held by Darwin and Wallace, was misconceived by Lord Salisbury, and that the minute differences which separate individuals are more important than Lord Salisbury's advantageously varied bridge and bridegroom.\n\nI cannot imagine that Lord Salisbury can have ever seriously studied Wallace on Darwinism, in which the great Professor so nobly fights for the all-sufficiency of Natural Selection as the originator of species\u2014a work bristling with instances of what I may call \"Wallacian Woods.\" A wood filled with a species of little bird, the individuals of which vary so much on the north and south sides that a naturalist, knowing only individuals from the extreme north\nand south confines, would describe them as separate species; whereas if he took a walk through the wood and collected individuals from all parts, he would find that there was every gradation between the extreme forms. Let us now suppose that some change comes over the environment, so that all the varieties in the centre of the wood become extinct, then the north and south varieties become species. I consider this ought to be called \"Wallace's theory.\" He propounded it simultaneously with Darwin, who, as we all know, became dissatisfied with its sufficiency; and since his day all kinds of modifications of the theory have been proposed, Wallace alone standing firmly by the original idea.\n\nWhen standing on a coral reef one is astonished at the extraordinary divergences under simultaneous conditions. On the sandy floors of the shallow sunlit pools we find sea-cucumbers, starfish, various kinds of molluscs, beautiful annelids, whilst darting through the water numerous brilliantly coloured fish of widely different families are seen swimming about. There is no apparent struggle for life: all seems peace and harmony, an abundant supply of well aerated water is furnished by the breakers outside, whilst the coral polyps themselves, and an abundance of minute life in the water and the sand, supplemented no doubt by the eggs or very young forms of the different inhabitants, furnish food for all; only the brilliantly coloured little crabs seek refuge in the interstices of the coral, or attach sponges or weeds to their shells until they become indistinguishable from their surroundings. It is curious that the best protected and best armed group should be the most retiring. This probably arises from the periodical casting of the shell, which leaves their soft bodies the favourite prey of their own species\u2014at least this is known to be the case with the lobster. How could these great divergences ever have arisen? There seems no point of vantage from which Natural Selection could commence its operations.\nBut let us look more closely into the subject. The reef probably abounds with money cowries. I exhibit a tray of these shells, all collected on the same spot. Any one seeing the shells separately would consider the best defined forms true species, but I have seen many thousands of the animals alive, and there is not the slightest difference between their inhabitants; perhaps some anatomist might show a constant difference of arrangement in the teeth of those that live in the smooth barred shells and those of the depressed knobly ones, but even then I should be disposed to dispute their specific difference, for if the shells are capable of so much variation, why not the arrangements of the teeth on the lingual ribbon?\n\nIn a tray on the table are exhibited the two extreme forms known as *Cypraea annulus*, Linn., and *C. moneta*, Linn., and the connecting links. The depressed triangular forms have both bars and annuli, and seem to have a tendency to assume the smoother form of annulus, sometimes retaining the bar and sometimes retaining only the yellow ring. In some instances the bars are ill-defined and become mere black blotches. This is an example of a \"Wallacian wood\" on a most gigantic scale, as these shells are found throughout the Australian Pacific and Indian Pacific oceans, or, as it has been aptly termed, the Great Ocean.\n\nAnother identical example is found in *Oliva mora*. I exhibit a tray of examples taken on the beach of Weligama bay, and seven varieties are figured in the *Conchologia Indica*, the animals found in these varied shells being to all appearance identical. Their range is the same as that of *C. moneta* and *C. annulus*. I consider this tendency to extreme variation as much a specific character as any other, as different species seem to exhibit it in every kind of combination with other characters.\n\nIn the above-mentioned shells we find the same varieties mixed together over an enormous area, and under very different climatic conditions. What their bathymetrical\nrange may be I cannot discover, but I imagine them to be a purely littoral species, and they all crawl freely out of water. The temperature of the surface water over this vast area seems to vary from about 63\u00b0 F. in its northern and southern limits to 86\u00b0 off Ceylon.\n\nIn a common fresh water shell found over a great part of India and all the low-country of Ceylon we find the same mixture of varieties over a large area, and under very different climatic conditions, as in the marine species. So great are the varieties that it has been described as *Paludomus acutus*, *modecella*, *spiralis*, *spurcus*, *lotusus*, *parvus*, *palustris*, and *obesus*, which, according to Blandford, are all synonyms of *Paludomus tanjoriencis*, Gmelin. These different varieties can in some localities be collected within the space of a few yards.\n\nThe genus *Tanalia* is restricted to the hills of the Central Province, and to the forest-clothed country of the south and south-west\u2014less than half the area of the entire Island. Its twenty-four species have been referred by Mr. Blandford to *Tanalia aculeata*, Gmelin, and he says that \"in the Kelani-ganga between Kitulgala and Yatiyantota he has collected *T. tennentii*, *T. picta*, and *T. undulata*, with intermediate varieties. Here we have an example of the same mixture of varieties, only over an extremely limited area in closely allied conditions of climate.\"\n\nThis form of a \"Wallacian wood\" is extremely common in Ceylon. One of the most remarkable examples of it is *Plotheia decrescens*, Walker, a tray of which is exhibited. It is almost impossible to find two of these moths alike. This extraordinary variability is the more remarkable in this case as we have another peculiar species, *P. strigfera*, which also appears to be very variable. Other instances occur in the frogs and the reptiles, and I consider that even in our monkeys (*Semnopithecus cephalopterus*, Zimmer, and *Semno pithecus ursinus*, Kelaart) we have merely varieties with a strong tendency to produce a white variety, which is well\nillustrated in our monkey-case upstairs. We have now seen two types of the \"Wallacian wood\": one in which extreme variability is found in every locality over a vast area, and a second in which it occurs in a very restricted area.\n\nAnother form of \"Wallacian wood\" is that in which we have great variety over a vast area, but the varieties do not intermingle, and each being confined within certain geographical limits is classified as a distinct species. Professor Wallace has illustrated this so beautifully in his *Island Life* and other works that I need not dwell further upon it.\n\nAnother form of \"Wallacian wood\" is that in which well-defined species in a very limited area are mingled with well-defined species covering large areas. A good example of this is seen in our pretty little Munias. We have a species peculiar to Ceylon, *Uroloncha Kelaarti*. We share another with Southern India, *U. striata*. From this *U. semistriata* of the Nicobars and *U. fumigata* of the Andamans both differ slightly, being thus reckoned as species peculiar to these islands. Our other two species, *U. malabarica* and *U. punctulata*, range over the whole continent of India, ascending the Himalayas up to about 5,000 ft.\n\nAnother form of distribution, the opposite extreme to that of the money cowry, is exemplified by our common sparrow, in which a form is constant over a very large area, or varies but very slightly. The Colombo sparrow undoubtedly varies slightly from the London sparrow, but not sufficiently, according to Messrs. Sharpe and Oates, to make them distinct species.\n\nFinally, we have what may be termed \"sports,\" variations of very rare occurrence, of which I exhibit two examples: one is a sport of the common *Batocera rubus* from the Morawak k\u00f3ral\u00e9, presented by Mr. Deslandes. This has been described by Mr. Gahan of the British Museum as *B. polli*. Another example is from Rambukkana, a female *Gongylodes gongylodes*, presented by Mr. T.S. Dawson.\nAt first sight it looks like a different species, but close inspection shows that it is merely a common form emphasized.\n\nIn a Paper I had the honour to read before this Society on the varieties of *Testudo elegans*, I remarked that I could see nothing in these varieties for natural selection to select from: the different individuals crawl about on the open plains in the midday sun, and we cannot imagine that one form of colouration or sculpture can be of more advantage than another. Here I fell into an error of the same kind as Lord Salisbury's; if I read my Wallace right, these variations under the present conditions are of no advantage: it is only when the conditions change that natural selection comes into play.\n\nLet us take the case of the money cowry. Supposing the conditions of the Red Sea and of the Japanese seas change, so that in the one only *C. moneta* survives and in the other only *C. annulus*; then we should certainly call them distinct species; or, supposing that the conditions of the Great Ocean were so changed that none of the varieties except the banded ones could survive, then we should have a single constant species over the whole area.\n\nIf we imagine the conditions to keep constant, then this banded species will tend to vary again; on the contrary, if the conditions continue to change in such a way that the species can slowly adapt itself to such changes, we have a case like that quoted by Romanes, in which transmutations of a water snail of the genus *Planorbis* can be traced through a long geological period in an ancient lake basin in Wurttemburg.\n\nThat such cases really occur in Nature there can be no reasonable doubt. Our species of Munias are an excellent example of such a case, and this could be multiplied by hundreds; and of course if we allow that species can arise from varieties in this way, there is not the slightest difficulty in granting that genera, families, orders, and classes may\nhave arisen in the same manner. In fact, these divisions are mere categories of human thought, and have no existence in nature.\n\nThe palaeontologists are rapidly filling up the gaps between the higher groups, and for the evidence of the embryologists I must refer you to Romanes on \"The Darwinian Theory.\"\n\nI cannot, however, agree with the late Professor Romanes that we can rest content with this theory because it is demonstrated, although not proved as a scientific fact; nor that when the theory has been raised to such a level of probability it stands on the same basis as the fully ascertained facts of science. We cannot absolutely say from whence the varieties of our money cowries have come, or what their future history will be, but if you take up the \"Nautical Almanac\" you can see every eclipse of Jupiter's moons given to the fraction of a second, three years hence; and if an astronomer chose to take the necessary trouble he could give you a Jupiter moon-eclipse time table for any number of years past or any number of years to come. No such evidence as this, Professor Romanes said, can ever possibly be given for any form of the Darwinian theory; but I prefer the dictum of the great Physiologist Claude Bernard, \"that we have no right to put any bounds to the possibilities of human discoveries.\"\n\nIt is for this reason that I have brought the foregoing examples of \"Wallacian woods,\" as they occur in Ceylon, before the Society. I confess Wallace's theory seems to me perfectly satisfactory, and sufficient to account for the origin of the countless forms of animals and plants now inhabiting the earth. But if this theory is true, these useless variations must be accompanied by other changes\u2014a principle known as the \"correlation of growth\"\u2014before they can form true physiological species, that is to say, species incapable of interbreeding.\n\nNow, in such a case as the money cowry it is surely in the power of anatomists to show whether the variations of the\nshell are attended with variations in the other parts of the animal or not?\n\nIn the genus *Plotheia*, surely careful collecting and breeding of the larv\u00e6 would show whether the different species interbreed or not, and by collecting the Munias of the Andamans and Nicobars, and attempting to interbreed them together, or with our Ceylon species, similar facts might be ascertained.\n\nWhen I first became acquainted with Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" I lived in a house surrounded with large grounds, with several hothouses, where the cultivation of domestic varieties of plants was an object lesson on Darwin's works, and no more thorough convert to Darwinism than myself ever existed; but when I came to study in the British Museum and saw species from all parts of the world, the theory seemed to me by no means satisfactory, and when in Ceylon I saw our extraordinarily varied *Phasmid\u00e6*, all living side by side in the same woods under precisely similar conditions of life, I ceased to have any faith in Natural Selection as the true cause for the origin of species.\n\nMy error arose from the idea that variations must be useful, whereas we cannot attach any idea of utility to the variations which I have exhibited to-night. It is only when the slowly changing environment gives a better chance of survival to one or more of these varieties over the other that Natural Selection comes into play.\n\nI do not know exactly what interpretation to place on Professor Wallace's dictum, that \"only useful variations are preserved.\" If this applies to the whole animal, of course in the long run this must be the case: only the fittest survive\u2014but if to particular structures, it seems to me to run counter to the theory.\n\nIn tracing the supposed line of descent, the preservation of useless or merely ornamental characters seems to me to afford a most important guide.\nThe hour-glass shaped mark on the backs of our frogs is an interesting instance. This cannot add to their power of concealment or benefit them in any way that we can see; as a fact, in *Rhacophorus maculatus*, Gray, it is of very rare occurrence, it is specific in *R. cruciger*, Blyth, and *R. eques*, G\u00fcnther. In *R. micro tympanum*, G\u00fcnther, we have a modified form of it, described in a very different way by Dr. Boulenger, but evidently merely a modification.\n\nThe common form from which these species have been derived no doubt possessed this character. The occurrence of peculiar markings in many species of those groups which we call genera is very common, and frequently enables us at once to refer the species before us to its proper place.\n\nThe interest of these local varieties consists in their study bringing us to the beginning of things. Good work is being done by many naturalists in careful observations and measurements, like the Papers, for instance, by Mr. H. Thompson on the common English shore crab, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, October, 1896, and my principal object has been to show what advantages we possess in Ceylon for following the subject up.\n\nConsidering the millions of ancestors any living specimen must have had, the wonder is that species breed so true. Where the variation is very small\u2014for I doubt if a case could be proved in the whole animal kingdom where there is none\u2014it arises in a great degree from the perfection of adaptation to its environment obtained by the species. We have such instances in cockroaches, rats, sparrows, and other semi-parasites of man, who are able to follow him in almost any climate, and under almost all conditions which he is able to live in himself. We see the same thing in some birds of very wide geographical distribution.\n\nThe great opposition that Darwinism received at first was owing to the belief that his doctrine implied the descent of man from the monkey: the real reading of course being that man and the existing monkeys have branched off from\nsome common ancestor, we are not descendants of either the gorilla or the chimpanzee, nor can we look on any existing species as our ancestors.\n\nIn the same way the money cowry can never give rise to a fish, reptile, bird, or mammal. It has long passed the point from which the molluscous branch started, or that from which bivalves or univalves, cowries, and olives arose. But its varieties, supposing it has not attained the highest point possible of development along its own line, will, with changing environment, give rise to new species, new genera, new families, then to groups which if we were immortal we should recognize as mollusca, and after to groups of which we can form no conception. This of course is a mere hypothesis as regards *C. annulis*, but the Paleontologists are daily proving more and more clearly that it is no hypothesis for the animals of the past.\n\nThe race of man has existed for so short a time that he speaks of the hills as everlasting. Geologists tell a very different tale, beautifully condensed by Tennyson:\n\nO earth, what changes hast thou seen!\nThe hills are shadows, and they flow\nFrom form to form, and nothing stands;\nThey melt like mist, the solid lands,\nLike clouds they shape themselves and go.\n\n9. Mr. Ferguson said the Paper just read was to him full of interest and instruction. Last September he was present in Professor Poulton's section of the British Association, when there was a battle-royal between Darwinians and anti-Darwinians; but the latter\u2014only one or two\u2014got very much worsted. He remembered many years ago hearing a lecture from a young naturalist (now a well-known Professor), in which he went so far as to remark on the spots on the camelopard as the consequence of its habit of standing under trees in its African home, the shade gradually causing the spots, in contrast with the bright sunshine on the rest of the body! He did not think the grave Professor of the present day would repeat such far-fetched suggestions of his youth. Meantime, he for one would be obliged if Mr. Haly\u2014out of consideration to the rudimentary knowledge which most of them who had only dipped into the writings of Darwin, Wallace, and Romanes, possessed\u2014could in a few words\ndefine the different, and differing, views of the two former eminent men, and how far Professor Romanes had successfully criticized them.\n\n10. Mr. Haly, in reply, gave a brief summary of Wallace's theory of \"Natural Selection,\" which was adopted by Darwin at first as sufficient to account for the \"Origin of Species,\" but afterwards modified by the addition of a special cause, \"Sexual Selection.\" Wallace had never swerved from the view he originally adopted, which he (Mr. Haly) considered perfectly satisfactory and sufficient to account for nearly all their zoological riddles. Romanes, Weissman, and others had offered criticisms, new theories, &c., but none that had specially affected Wallace's position.\n\n11. Mr. O. Collett then moved a vote of thanks to the writers of the Papers. This was seconded by Mr. P. Radley and carried.\n\n12. Rev. F. H. de Winton moved a vote of thanks to the Chairman, remarking on the instructive character of the Papers read and the interesting remarks which had followed.

C. P. Bell, C.C.S., Archaeological Commissioner.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\u2020\n\nSigiri Rock is situated in the Central Province, some twelve miles north-east of Dambulla and a score or so almost due west of Polonnaruwa.\n\nSir Emerson Tennent says of it:\n\nSigiri is the only example in Ceylon of those solitary acclivities which form so remarkable a feature in the tableland of the Dekkan, starting abruptly from the plain with scarped and perpendicular sides, and converted by the Indians into strongholds, accessible only by precipitous pathways, or steps hewn in the solid rock. This gigantic cylindrical rock starts upward to a height prodigious in comparison with its section at any point. Its scarped walls are nearly perpendicular, and in some places they overhang their base. The formation of this singular cliff can only be ascribed to its upheaval by a subterranean force so circumscribed in action that its effects were confined within a very few yards, yet so irresistible as to have shot aloft this prodigious pencil of stone to the height of nearly 400 ft.\n\nAbove the plain in which it stands this huge oval mass of gneiss rock rises to a height of about 600 ft. For about half its height it is masked by terraces and d\u00e9bris, covered with forest and m\u00e1na grass, and the upper portion is, without the help of ladders, entirely inaccessible from its overhanging its base nearly the whole way round.\n\nAlong the western and northern faces of Sigiri-gala ran a gallery\u2014one of the most extraordinary engineering feats of the ancient world\u2014at the level where the Rock has the smallest diameter; so that while it stands upon that portion\n\n* In illustration were exhibited plans, drawings, photographs, &c., as well as the whole set of facsimile copies in oils of the Frescoes.\n\n\u2020 See the Papers on \"Sigiri\" in Journal. R. A. S., vols. VII. and VIII. (N. S.), by Messrs. Rhys Davids and Blakesley.\nwhich projects below, it is at the same time protected by the part which overhangs it. The outer side of this gallery was formed by a brick wall tapering to the top. Ledges sunk in the Rock received the wall, and at a certain height transverse blocks of a quartzose stone were laid across from the wall to the Rock so as to form a pavement. The wall had a coating of hard white plaster, much of which retains a high polish to the present time.\n\nAbout a hundred yards of this gallery still stand almost perfect; but from the present iron ladders on the north side of the Rock to the point where the gallery once reached its summit on the north-east, the structure has completely vanished. Grooves and oblong \"catches\" cut in the Rock show where it was formerly sustained.\n\nUntil the fixing of the iron ladders and railing in 1895 the ascent to the summit of Sigiri-gala was attended with extreme risk; and had been accomplished by less than a dozen Europeans.\n\nSome of the natural concavities of the Rock scarp have been further scooped\u2014on its west cliff above the gallery\u2014into caves or \"pockets\"; and in two or three of these remains of painting may yet be seen. The \"pockets\" are now inaccessible without elaborate preparations.\n\nThe south-west foot of the Rock is washed by a picturesque tank\u2014at the present day of limited area, but anciently very extensive, with a substantial \"bund\" that joined the neighbouring rock, M\u00e1p\u00e1-gala, and extended southwards for several miles.\n\nTo east and west of the Rock are rectangular areas\u2014terraces of earthwork held up by massive stone revetments\u2014which, together with the Rock itself, cover nearly 300 acres and constitute the site of \"Sigiri-nuwara.\" The outer line of defence was formed by an immense embankment surrounded for much of its circuit by a diy\u00e1galak, or moat.\n\nInside the western area of the ancient city are the remains of three or four lesser moated enclosures, and of\ncountless boulders, whose sides, where overhanging, formed rough cave shelters, whilst their tops were crowned with buildings, &c.\n\nAs a fortress \"Sigiri-nuwara\" must have been impregnable at the period: its defenders could have been forced into surrender only by starvation or treachery.\n\nIt was here, in the fifth century A.D., that for eighteen years Kasyapa I., the parricide, lived (as the Mahawansa quaintly puts it) \"in fear of the world to come and of Moggailana,\" and ultimately met the just retribution of his crime.*\n\nSigiriya was subsequently handed over to the Buddhist priesthood as a monastic establishment. But for centuries the Rock has been entirely abandoned, though a small Buddhist temple is kept up at Piduragala, a hill situated one mile to the north.\n\nPREAMBLE.\n\nThe third season's work of the Archaeological Survey at Sigiriya commenced on February 6 last.\n\nIt had been found necessary, after two years' wear, to construct new leaf and thatch \"lines\" for the coolies. For this purpose an overseer with a limited gang preceded the main body by six weeks.\n\nBesides clearing a fresh site on higher ground at a more convenient distance from the tank, and putting up four blocks of rooms, this advance force was engaged in rendering passable the road from Inamalawa (greatly damaged in places by the exceptionally heavy north-east monsoon of 1896),\u2014in re-cutting approaches to the Rock, washed away nearly everywhere,\u2014and in freeing the summit of the thick growth of mana grass,\u2020 tall weeds, and scrub that annually cover the surface with aggravating persistency.\n\nLABOUR FORCE.\n\nNews of the ample and more salubrious housing provided this year soon augmented the respectable strength, 110\n\n* Mahawansa, XXXIX. \u2020 Andropogon Zeylanicus.\nhands, which began work in February, by a steady influx of recruits from Anur\u00e1dhapura and other places. Above all, the higher rate of pay known to rule at Sigiriya acted as the chief incentive, whereby the Archaeological Survey \"mill\" was kept constantly supplied with a never-failing stock of living \"grist.\"\n\nA score or more of Sinhalese drawn from the surrounding villages\u2014double the number that volunteered for work on the Rock in 1896\u2014also sought employment, and proved willing and competent \"basket-men.\"\n\nAs before, I supervised operations personally, from the start until we broke camp on May 25.\n\n**WEATHER.**\n\nComparatively little rain fell at Sigiriya during the first six months of this year. The rain-gauge register (continued after my departure by the Head Draughtsman) gives a daily average of only 12 in. for the six and a half months between February 1 and July 10. The highest record for twenty-four hours did not exceed 1.53; but that fell \"plump\" in an hour and a half.\n\nAt the beginning of May\u2014later than usual\u2014the wind veered round to the south-west,\u2014the annual warning that the time remaining for unrestricted work on the top of Sigiri-gala is limited to a few days. The tearing strength of this \"yal-hulanga,\" when fully developed, as it sweeps across the lone, exposed Rock, can only be realized by actual experience.\n\n**HEALTH.**\n\nThanks to the continuance\u2014unlike previous seasons\u2014of unusually fine weather, almost every week marked \"a clean bill of health.\"\n\nTwo mild cases of measles caused me anxiety for a while. The patients were at once segregated, and luckily no fresh cases occurred. Had infection spread, that insensate panic which renders the ordinary Tamil coolly, or Sinhalese goiy\u00e1, deaf to reason in the face of any epidemic would have led,\nin all probability, to wholesale desertions, and perhaps necessitated the total abandonment of further operations for the year.\n\nFever, and simple abrasions incidental to earthwork\u2014from neglect not infrequently degenerating into ugly sores\u2014kept a small proportion of hands in the \"lines\" now and again; but only two men left, temporarily, to be cured at the Dambulla hospital.\n\nThe climate of Sigiriya has usually proved bracing to coolies, the majority of whom live for two-thirds of the year in the jungle-bound chenas and low-lying lands about Anuradhapura. Month by month they \"put on flesh,\" despite the unspeakable heat which an eight-hours' spell of work upon the bare Rock involves; and return, after the four months' absence, robust and sleek, with a stock of health that enables them to battle the better against the insidious malaria of the North-Central Province.\n\nAgain, this year no accident of any sort happened\u2014good fortune, for which I cannot be too thankful.\n\nNo amount of precautions avails against the mad recklessness of the Tamil cooly let loose on Sigiri-gala. He becomes for the nonce a veritable \"indiarubber idiot on the spree,\" risking life airily a dozen times a day.\n\nWhen it is remembered that in the past three seasons at least 20,000* persons have climbed to the top of Sigiri Rock, have spent hours at work on its limited surface and steep slopes, with a sheer fall all round of 300 to 400 ft., yet that every man, woman, and child has descended in safety,\u2014no one will grudge me the satisfaction I feel at a record smirched by not a single casualty.\n\n**Summary of Work.**\n\nAfter a couple of years' experience it is fair to expect that operations, at a given site and by practically the same hands, should proceed smoothly and apace.\n\nAnd so it has been at Sigiriya. The past season's work\n\n---\n\n* Say, eighty coolies daily for three seasons of three months; or, 80 by 3 by 3 by 30 = 21,600.\nhas proved successful even beyond expectation. No hitch occurred: all went well from first to last; and, as the result, the heavy task provisionally mapped out at the start was accomplished fully.\n\nThe work got through in the four months may be conveniently classed as in former Reports, under\u2014\n\n(1) Exploration and Survey of Sigiri-nuwara.\n(2) Excavations.\n(3) Miscellaneous.\n(4) Copying the Frescoes.\n\nSuccinctly\u2014the \"M\u00e1p\u00e1-gala\" Rocks to the south of Sigiri-gala, and the bunds to its east, have been freed of jungle and explored; the survey of the wide area once occupied by the ancient city completed; the western and north-western portions of the Rock's summit dug up (bringing to a close the excavation of the citadel); ascent to the top of Sigiri-gala made doubly safe; and, above all (for the speedy reproduction of these unique paintings, yearly dwindling, had become of much moment), the whole of the sixteen frescoes remaining untouched in 1896 have been copied in oils by Mr. D. A. L. Perera, Head Draughtsman of the Archaeological Survey.\n\n(1) EXPLORATION AND SURVEY OF SIGIRI-NUWARA.\n\nAs usual, it was not until the end of April that the Sinhalese villagers of the Inamalawa K\u00f3ral\u00e9 cared to leave their paddy fields and seek work in clearing the forest undergrowth and low jungle, which covered parts of the ancient city not opened out in 1895 and 1896.*\n\nThis year the two low bunds which run eastwards from the Rock roughly parallel for more than a mile, were followed until lost in higher ground. Their object is open to doubt: perhaps they helped to retain in this direction the water of \"Mah\u00e1 Sigiri-v\u0113wa,\" the huge tank that served the city in former days. Its chief bund, uniting Sigiri-gala with\n\n* On the \"Rough Plan of Sigiri-nuwara\" accompanying this Report the extent cleared in 1895 is coloured dark green,\u2014in 1896, a lighter shade,\u2014in 1897, pale green.\nM\u00e1pa-gala, trended thence in a south-westerly direction for a league or more. The \"vil bemma,\" or outer rampart, of the city to the east of the Rock was also traced, cleared, and mapped,* as well as the lesser rocks, boulders, &c., on that side.\n\nFurther, the forest brushwood has been thinned out for a quarter of a mile or so west of the modern village of S\u00edgiriya, immediately south of the paddy fields and minor road from Inamalawa. Within this area, besides a flattish outcrop of rock, lie the \"M\u00e1pa-gala\" rocks\u2014twin hummocks joined on to the great S\u00edgiri Rock by the short bund of the present insignificant tank, and split in two by a narrow gorge. The close connection of these subsidiary rocks with Sigiri-gala was (as anticipated in my last Report) at once apparent as soon as the underwood and grass had been cut and burnt.\n\nUpon, and about, the two main rocks and the numerous boulders and levelled interspaces off their slopes, are traces of walls and cross-walls in stone, with here and there a brick-strewn site. A single cave on the east side is still utilized by the villagers for a humble d\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9.\n\nNear M\u00e1pa-gala we fortunately lighted on an inscribed pillar, albeit in pieces, of interest historically; for it prolongs considerably the period up to which it is certain that S\u00edgiriya continued the site of a monastic establishment.\n\nUpon the death of K\u00e1syapa I. and the fall of his citadel in the fifth century, his younger brother and conqueror, Moggall\u00e1na, gave, according to the Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1\u2014\u2020\n\nThe Dalha and the D\u00e1th\u00e1-Konda\u00f1\u00f1a Vih\u00e1r\u00e9s at the S\u00edhagiri Rock to the S\u00e1galika and Dhammaruchi brethren; and having converted the fortress itself into a vih\u00e1r\u00e9 he gave it to Mah\u00e1n\u00e1ma,\u2021 the elder of the D\u00edghasanda Vih\u00e1r\u00e9.\n\nMoggall\u00e1na's son, \"the famous Kum\u00e1ra Dh\u00e1tus\u00e9na,\" says the same chronicle, \"made improvements to the vih\u00e1r\u00e9 that his father had built.\"\u00a7\n\n* At present under chena encroachment, which is engaging the attention of the Assistant Government Agent, M\u00e1tal\u00e9.\n\u2020 Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1, XXXIX., 41, 42. \u00a7 Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1, XLI., 1, 2.\n\u2021 His great-uncle, the author of the first 36 chapters of the Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1.\nHenceforth Sigiriya drops altogether out of the Mah\u00e1-wans\u00e1 record, save for a passing allusion to the murder there of King Sa\u1e45gha Tisa and his son about 608 A.D.\n\nToo broken and weathered to permit of much of the contents being read, the stone has yielded the name of the royal grantor, \"Siri Sang Bo,\" who, from the form of the Sinhalese characters, should be Sena II., so that the existence of a Buddhist temple at Sigiriya as late at least as the beginning of the tenth century is now assured.\n\n(2) EXCAVATIONS.\n\nIn pursuance of the plan of work decided on last year (viz., to complete the digging of the Rock citadel before commencing to break ground at its base and elsewhere), the whole force was concentrated on the effort to finally round off, if possible, the excavation of the summit.\n\nThe accompanying \"Plan of the summit of Sigiri-gala, 1895\u20131897,\" explains, by varied colouring, the direction and extent of our annual advance in digging. As pointed out in my first Report\u2014\n\nThe general fall of the ground is from west to east and, less abruptly, from north to south,\u2014doubtless following the slope of the living rock below. This natural declivity was evidently turned to account in the adaptation of the ground for the terraces and buildings which once occupied it. The terraces along the high ground bordering the west edge and stretching inwards to about the axis of the hill fall away very gradually from north to south, as do those from the central pokuna, or pond, to the south and east verge of the Rock. The steepest bank runs longitudinally south from the north end of the Rock, marking the high ground off from the low-level area. The only high bank lying east and west adjoins the Rock\u2019s north-east edge.*\n\nWe started in 1895 at the north-east corner, and keeping to the foot of the high ground on the west, worked our way slowly\u2014and, from total ignorance of what to expect, somewhat clumsily\u2014down to the brink of the pokuna.\n\nLast year (1896), strengthened in numbers as well as by the valuable experience gained, far more digging was done, and that cleaner withal.\n\n* C. A. S. Journal, vol. XIV., No. 46, 1895, p. 49.\nLeaving the cleaning out of the pokuna, as most sheltered from the wind, for the last week of the season's work, we pushed past it, skirting the Rock's east edge, and so on southwards, until the entire low-level area lying between the pond and the southernmost verge of the Rock, besides a small slice of the higher section, was completely excavated.*\n\nThis season, as a glance at the \"Plan\" will show, we had\u2014to drop for a moment into colloquialism\u2014\"our work fully cut out,\" if \"the high-level area, which, broadly speaking, occupies the western half of the summit,\" was to be laid bare before the south-west gale fell on us.\n\nIt is the more pleasing, therefore, to be able to record that (with the exception of a terrace some 70 ft. or so down the west scarp) the task has been thoroughly mastered.\n\nAs far as concerns the citadel that once crowned Sigiri Rock\u2014finis coronat opus. It is open to any one now to ascend the Rock with ease and safety, and to follow out on its summit (slopes excluded) the complete plan of a marvellous structure 1,400 years old, yet in outline virtually as perfect as when first laid out.\n\nI said in 1896 that we hoped \"to uncover next year (i.e., 1897) on the higher level the chief rooms, for they would naturally be built in the most commanding position.\" Nor have we been disappointed.\n\nStarting at half a dozen points, where a step or two barely showing above the d\u00e9bris indicated the probable ascent from the lower to the higher area, and trenching onwards up successive flights of stairs\u2014a score in all, more or less\u2014and along retaining walls, the several parties, working simultaneously from north, south, and east, joined hands ultimately in the large upper apartments situated towards the north-west corner of the Rock.\n\nThe rooms, courtyards, &c., stretch the whole length of the ridge, in gently ascending tiers, from the small chamber directly above the Rock cistern at the south to the penultimate, and uppermost, room near the north end.\n\n* C. A. S. Journal, vol. XIV., No. 47, 1896, p. 249.\nAll are oblong, and all\u2014or nearly all\u2014the chambers had corridors completely round them. Many passages, &c., were paved throughout with quartz slabs; though much of this choice pavement has been displaced by the wash of centuries, or from being deliberately put to other use by Buddhist monks, when the fortune of war found them located in the \"marble halls\" of royalty. To this latter accident is also probably due the sorry internal alterations which some of the rooms seem to have undergone,\u2014division and subdivision,\u2014until the original configuration is past tracing with certainty.\n\nSo, too, as regards surface decoration\u2014stucco mouldings, ornament, and the like, that K\u0101syapa's royal stronghold would hardly lack\u2014a few stray fragments, turned up by the spade, are the sole traces left to us by the \"sons of Buddha,\" inured to simplest surroundings and averse to permit worldly attractions to break in upon the austerity of daily life.\n\nOn clearing the tangled m\u00e1na grass and low jungle off the west edge of the Rock a surprise awaited us. It became for the first time evident that the whole side of the slope\u2014here more prolonged than on the other faces\u2014had been grooved deeply to hold the foundations of a lower reach of rooms and passages, and drain the summit speedily of the heaviest rainfall.\n\nThe boldness of conception and pre-eminent skill which enabled these old architects to make even the steepest slopes of Sigiri-gala subservient to their will, led them to annex profitably every inch of possible foothold. The exterior wall of the citadel, which wholly engirdled the Rock (except on the south-west), was built everywhere several feet\u2014indeed for a great part of the circuit some yards\u2014below the flat summit, and must have risen majestically all round from the very brink of the precipice.\n\nNay more: at one point it positively descended the sheer side of the Rock to a lower reach.\n\nTwo-thirds of the height up the west cliff, towards its northern end, is a ledge of the main Rock nearly 50 yards\nin length by 10 broad,\u2014from below it looks a mere streak marked by a little vegetation,\u2014which terminates in two cramped caves, or rock \"pockets.\"*\n\nThe obvious suitability of these, and the similar, but higher placed, pair of caves at the southern extremity of the Rock, for \"watches\" over the country from south to north-west, cannot fail to strike any one studying the capabilities of Sigiri-gala as a rock fortress. To that purpose these primitive \"belvederes\"\u2014if I may so term them\u2014must have been applied when the citadel was threatened: whilst in times of peace they would signal messages broadcast to the city spread out below.\n\nAt present, the only means of reaching this barely accessible break in the western cliff is by a rope let down the long slope from the summit as far as the vertical rock wall, with a straight drop thence of 15 ft. on to the ledge.\n\nToo late in the season we succeeded in getting a jungle-stick ladder into position at the bottom of the slope, and commenced to excavate the d\u00e9bris covering stairs that lead down to the small look-out caves. But the south-west gale caught us with the work half finished, and its completion has to stand over for next year.\n\nTime enough to guide the inquirer step by step on paper through the length and breadth of this wondrous structure when a full Report, illustrated by detailed plans of corridors, stairs, rooms, &c., numbered seriatim, can make such circumambulation intelligible. For the present a flying sketch (so to speak) of the citadel, as it stands exhumed, may suffice to give a general idea of its complex, yet harmonious, ground plan.\n\nClimbing the iron ladders at the point where the gallery once zigzagged up the north face of the Rock\u2014first west, then east\u2014the rock-cut grooves (from which all vestiges of masonry have long since disappeared) run up to the summit at an easy gradient.\n\n* See Plate, \"Sigiri-gala (West face).\"\nMount the topmost flight of steps of the erstwhile \"gallery\" still in position; and note the view.\n\nDirectly in front, looking south from the vantage ground of the east to west cross bank, stretched below as far as the central pokuna, is so much of the lower area as lies between the Rock's north and east edges and the high ridge that occupies the western half of the summit. Most here is comparatively level\u2014the only level portion of any extent in a citadel where terraced arrangement was inevitable from the irregular conformation of the Rock's surface. This area was seemingly allotted to courtyards, passages, and side rooms. Half-way a winding staircase of three or four flights of steps\u2014the longest on the Rock, and pierced at its head through tall flanking walls\u2014shows the means of direct communication with the upper area to the west. At the side of these stairs is the magnificently carved \"gal-\u00e1sanaya,\" or granite throne, discovered in 1895.\n\nOn the left, skirting the east edge of the Rock, was a range of minor rooms and passages, doubtless communicating with an outermost corridor, which almost encircled the citadel. This series of side chambers was continued on to near the south end of the Rock, interrupted only at the pond, where extra rooms, &c., intervene.\n\nAs I had occasion to note in last year's Report:\n\nThat part of the ancient citadel lying south of the pond, and east of the high-level strip, was laid out in a series of cross-terraces, east and west, varying in width\u2014and falling away southwards. From the pokuna to the foot of the last staircase at the extreme south are seven or eight distinct terraces........ The centre is taken up with an open courtyard and passages leading to the pond, and round it, on either side, by stairs and intermediate landings\u2014all admirably planned to suit the physical conditions, and displaying great ingenuity in turning to full account the limited space and surface inequalities of the Rock's summit.*\n\nMore than one of these terraces has been curtailed and hideously disfigured by single-brick walls of later construction\u2014\"patched up into a smoothness and smugness\"\n\n* C. A. S. Journal, vol. XIV., No. 47, 1896, p. 251.\nRuskin forcibly pronounces \"more tragic than uttermost ruin.\"\n\nThe lowest staircase\u2014at the south-west corner of the Rock\u2014descends with a right angle return to the \"watch-cave\" in the perpendicular crag on this side. The southernmost terrace, to the east of these stairs, was clearly dedicated to Cloacina.\n\nOf the higher level half of the summit I have already spoken, as containing a succession of apartments, rising in tiers northwards.\n\nThe backbone, as it were, of the citadel is found in the paved way, with steps descending ever and anon, that was carried along its axis from end to end, hugging the retaining wall of the upper ridge, and winding with its angles, but for the most part running straight as an arrow. From this \"spinal column\" branch off, east and west, staircase \"ribs,\" which would render communication between all parts of the citadel easy and rapid; whilst each section was equally well served, by the cunningly designed interconnection of its own component divisions, through a maze of minor passages and stairs.\n\nNo less perfectly planned was the water supply. The rock-hewn pokuna, nearly 30 yards square, centrally situated and accessible from every side, would suffice, when replenished yearly by the north-east monsoon rains, for ordinary requirements during the ensuing dry months. For drinking water resort was had, in all probability, to two at least of the three smaller cisterns close to the Rock's north, south-west, and south-east edges.\n\nA word or two regarding the architectural construction of the citadel.\n\nFurther lengthening of the deep longitudinal trench, begun last year from the extreme southern verge, confirms the impression that the foundations were throughout the low-level area, in general, of that form of stonework known as \"irregular horizontal,\" and run down to the rock core. Upon this rested brick walls, vertical or in batter, plain or moulded, according to position and purpose, but all alike coated thickly\nwith a tough plaster, white and polished, that has resisted the damp in places to this day. The massiveness of many of these walls bespeaks considerable height originally, despite the fact that the brickwork was almost dry-laid and indifferently bonded crosswise. But in \"make\" these ancient bricks\u2014some a cubit in length\u2014shame most of our modern outturn, being as well burnt as they are sharp and close.\n\nOf the system of roofing we know nothing beyond the certainty that it was timbered throughout and flat-tiled, in the style familiar among the Anur\u00e1dhapura ruins.\n\nA marked feature of the ground plan is the erratic location of steps. As often as not, they are pushed aside from the centre of the rooms into which they lead, and relegated to all sorts of odd corners. This vagary was no doubt forced upon the architects by the unconformable surface of the rock, which had to be reckoned with everywhere.\n\nBut noteworthy, above all, is the complete absence of monolith pillars and stone-carved doorways, the most salient characteristic of ancient structures in the Island. Whilst quartzous steps and flagstones were lavishly employed to enhance the beauty of this peerless citadel, not one fragment of column, door-frame, or window-sash in stone has come to light on Sigiri-gala. Above the floor all was of brick or wood. As for gneiss, with the sole exception of the noble throne above mentioned\u2014like silver in the days of Solomon\u2014\"it was nothing accounted of,\" and finds no place in K\u00e1syapa's citadel.\n\nLittle wonder that the glory of a structure, towering to heaven on the dizzy heights of Sigiri-gala, \"white as snow\" within and without, should call forth irresistably the unalloyed admiration of the old chronicler, not given to spare its master-hand, King K\u00e1syapa, \"that wicked ruler of men.\" \"He built there,\" so it is written, \"a lovely palace splendid to behold, like unto a second \u00c1lakamand\u00e1, and lived there like (its lord) Kuv\u00e9ra.\"\n\n* Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1, XXXIX., p. 5.\nHow little comparatively now remains to attest the ancient beauty and grandeur of Sigiri-nuwara, the parricide's stronghold:\n\nThose golden pallaces, those gorgeous halles,\nWith fourniture superfluouslie faire;\nThose statelie courts, those sky-encountring walls,\nEvanish all like vapours in the aire.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS.\n\nOf extra work carried out this year\u2014apart from the copying of the frescoes, which will be presently dealt with\u2014the most important was the improvement, obviously called for, in the means of ascent to the Rock's summit.\n\nThe two stout iron ladders put up by the Public Works Department in 1894\u201395, which land the climber at the bottom of the grooved slope (the track of the \"gallery\" long since washed away), need only light hand-rails and flat iron below the rungs to further simplify ascent. Not so the low single rail carried up the slope to the top of the Rock from the head of the ladders. This makeshift hand-hold was distinctly unsafe\u2014as easy to slip under as trip over\u2014and each season I have had to take the precaution of supplementing it with a close-tied fence of jungle sticks. I, therefore, took upon myself this year the responsibility of making, once for all, a \"Union Jack\" fence in iron. Additional standards have been sunk into the rock, a higher rail run through them, and diagonal bars fixed across each span.\n\n\"Siha-giri Rock, that was hard for men to climb,\"\u2014as the Mah\u0101vans\u0101 puts it,\u2014may for the future be ascended in perfect safety by the most timid.\n\nMr. Perera being fully occupied in painting the frescoes until early in July, the drawing in detail of walls, stairs, &c., excavated since 1896 will be resumed and completed next season.\n\nA hundred photographs and upwards were added to the lengthy series of views of Sigiriya commenced in 1895. It is intended to make this series exhaustive, in order that\nit may still be possible to study the architecture of every portion of the citadel, even when, as is inevitable, much now standing shall have yielded to the \"tooth of time and razure of oblivion.\"\n\nAs in past seasons, few \"finds\" of special interest were dug up. From the quantity of heavy iron nails, bolts, clamps, &c., brought to light, it is clear that the doors were massy, and strongly bound.\n\nA handsome Greek-pattern vase, or cruse, blue-enamelled, is the chief piece of ancient pottery yet yielded by the excavations.*\n\nCOPYING THE FRESCOES.\n\nThe whole set of the unique frescoes of Sigiriya has at length been faithfully reproduced on canvas, and in a manner worthy of the original paintings.\n\nThe Government and the public owe this happy result to the singular talent, unflagging patience, and real courage of one man\u2014Mr. D. A. L. Perera, ex-student of St. Benedict's Institute, and now Head Draughtsman of the Archaeological Survey. Altogether, from first to last, in 1896 and this year, Mr. Perera spent nineteen weary weeks\u2014practically five months\u2014in the cheerless \"pocket\" caves of Sigiri-gala working on day after day from morning to evening\u2014exposed latterly to the driving force of the south-west wind, and sorely tried at times by inflammation of the eyes and attacks of fever\u2014before the final touch could be put to the last of the twenty-two paintings.\n\nTo glance back for a moment at the gradual steps leading up to this full fruition of hopes, which in 1895 seemed faint indeed.\n\nThe frescoes, in their inaccessible isolation high above the \"gallery\" that clings to the Rock, well sheltered by the beetling crag, have naturally attracted the notice of every visitor to Sigiriya. Tennent, Rhys Davids, Blakesley, each in turn specially alludes to them.\n\n* Exhibited at the Meeting.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nBut it was left for Sir A. H. Gordon, when Governor of Ceylon, to initiate practical action for the securing of copies of the paintings.\n\nAt the desire of His Excellency the Governor, Mr. A. Murray (aided by Mr. F. G. Pigott, both of the Public Works Department) undertook in 1889 the uninviting task of reaching the frescoes; and, surmounting all difficulties, climbed into the larger, or more southerly ('B'), of the two rock \"pockets\" in which the only well-preserved paintings still exist.\n\nIn a short paper communicated to \"Black and White\" in 1891,* Mr. Murray thus describes the method then adopted for the ascent:\n\nHoles were jumped into the rock face, one above the other, as the timber staging was carried up, and iron jumpers driven home and secured with cement. To these the staging was lashed and rendered secure. Once the chamber was reached a hemp rope ladder with wooden rungs was made fast to stout iron stanchions sunk into the floor of the chamber itself and made as rigid as possible by attachment to the staging. The erection of the staging was by no means an easy matter ............ It was found that the floor of the \"pocket\" was at too steep an angle to admit of any one sitting, much less standing. Iron stanchions were therefore let into the floor, and a strong trestle, or framework, made secure to them. On this was placed a platform, from which the work of copying the frescoes was carried out. The frescoes being painted on the roof and upper sections of the sides of the chamber, the staging, as erected, made it only possible to copy them by lying at full length on back or side.\u2020\n\nEven so\u2014cramped in position, hampered by the harsh June gale, and limited in time to a week\u2014Mr. Murray brought away copies, done in coloured chalks, of thirteen (all he could reach) of the seventeen frescoes in \"pocket\" 'B.' I may be permitted to repeat here what I said last year:\n\nAs an heroic first attempt to reproduce the frescoes, carried out under conditions which rendered full success hopelessly impossible,\n\n* No. 1891: *reprinted in the Ceylon Literary Register, 1891, vol. II., p. 85.\n\n\u2020 A large sectional drawing hung in the Public Hall showed (to left) the method of ascent employed by Mr. Murray in 1889, and (to right) that adopted by the Archaeological Survey in 1896\u201397.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nMr. Murray's efforts are beyond praise........ That under circumstances more favourable the Archaeological Survey has been enabled to obtain, for the first time, actual facsimiles of the Sigiriya frescoes\u2014just as they remain after the wear and tear of nearly fifteen centuries\u2014need in no degree detract from the individual merit of Mr. Murray's pioneer work.*\n\n\"'Tis not in mortals,\" as we know, \"to command success.\" Mr. Murray has done more: he has deserved it. His rapidly executed, but none the less beautiful, crayon drawings adorn the Museum walls: to drag them into comparison with the finished copies in oils of a trained draughtsman would be as unbecoming as unjust.\n\nIn 1895\u2014our first season\u2014\"Mr. Perera was prepared with all requisite materials for copying the fresco portraits.\" But it was not until the following year, after protracted correspondence, that the Public Works Department solved the difficulty of devising some inexpensive plan for making both the \"pockets\" ('A,' 'B') accessible.\n\nSeveral alternative proposals culminated in a suggestion of the Provincial Engineer, Central Province, which was adopted. Mr. R. D. Ormsby designed\u2014\n\nA vertical wire ladder, cane-hooped, and securely fastened to iron jumpers above and stout rings below\u2014a mode of ascent theoretically simple, but requiring a firm hold and a sure head.\u2020\n\nThis ladder the Public Works Department could not get into position for some time after we commenced work last year. In consequence, only six facsimile copies of the complete series were finished in 1896.\n\nThe delay was, however, turned to account profitably in a collateral direction\u2014the securing of a comprehensive painting of the two \"pockets\" 'A,' 'B,' and their frescoes as a whole.\u2021\n\nI quote from last year's Report:\u2014\n\nThe height of the \"pockets\" from the ground and the gallery prevents a complete view of all the frescoes together being got from\n\n* C. A. S. Journal, vol. XIV., No. 47, 1896, pp. 256-57. \u2020 Id., p. 254.\n\u2021 Besides the copying of the \"viyan redda\" painting, discovered in a cave under a boulder west of the Rock.\nPhotographing the Frescoes from mid-air.\nany one point, except at such a distance that even a tele-photographic lens failed to bring them reasonably close. We therefore decided to photograph and paint the two caves from mid-air.\n\nA 4-in. hawser was lowered to the ground from the summit over the west cliff (which here projects considerably), and a strong iron block bound to the end. Through this block a 2-in. rope was passed, and an improvised chair firmly tied on to it: the hawser was then pulled half way up the Rock scarp. Hauled up thus, one swung in the air upwards of 150 ft. above the ground, and 50 ft. clear of the cliff.*\n\nInstantaneous photographs were tried, but with little success, owing to the strong wind and an indifferent drop-shutter.\n\nOn the other hand, after a week's \"rocking\" in space, Mr. Perera completed an excellent little oil painting, to scale (about $\\frac{1}{3}$nd). This shows at a glance the relative position of the several figures.\u2020\n\nThis season the same wire ladder was erected in good time. Mr. Perera set to work in February, and plodded on steadily until, first, the remaining eleven frescoes of \"pocket\" 'B,' and finally, the five in 'A' had been copied in every particular.\n\nAs to the wonderful fidelity with which Mr. Perera has carried through a laborious undertaking, encompassed by great difficulties, I can but reiterate the high opinion I put on record last year:\n\nIt is hardly going too far to assert that the copies represent the original frescoes, as they may still be seen at Sigiriya, with a faithfulness almost perfect. Not a line, not a flaw or abrasion, not a shade of colour, but has been reproduced with the minutest accuracy.\u2021\n\nThe wire ladder, as fixed, falls almost perpendicularly to the floor of the \"gallery,\" within one foot of its wall, from the shoulder of the overhanging rock, 40 ft. up. From that point the rock bends inwards for 4 ft. or so to the sloping floor of the larger \"pocket\" 'B.' This cave is fairly roomy\u201438 ft. 4 in. by 11 ft. 8 in.\u2014and more than high enough to\n\n*See Plate. The deep shadows were cast by the setting sun. [An enlarged drawing was on exhibition at the Meeting.\u2014Hon. Sec.]\n\n\u2020Exhibited at the Meeting. The accompanying Plate has been lithographed from a photograph of Mr. Perera's painting.\n\n\u2021I may add that Mr. Perera's work has been examined on the spot and received unstinted praise from a succession of visitors, official and private, who have had the opportunity of comparing the copies with the original paintings on the spot.\nstand in upright, except at the left, or north, end. Here the floor rises steeply on to a narrow slanting ledge, only 3 ft. 6 in. in height and but a cubit in width\u2014the sole possible means of approach to the second, and much smaller, \"pocket\" 'A,' which is barely 3 ft. wide.\n\nIt was not practicable for Mr. Murray in 1889 to reach this northern cave from his trestle staging.\n\nLast year, at the outset, I had iron standards (3 ft. 4 in. in height), with a single top rail, driven into the rock above the ladder along the edge of both \"pockets\" and the connecting ledge, as an essential safeguard. Without such hand-rail a slip on the smooth shelving floor would mean instant death on the rocks fifty yards below.*\n\nThirteen of the frescoes in \"pocket\" 'B' can be easily touched from the floor, being painted on the rock wall and lower part of the oblique roof at the back of the cave\u2014the throat, so to speak, of gaping rock jaws\u2014but they are not on one level. No. 14 is on the wall at the south, or right \"horn\" of the half-moon chamber; Nos. 15, 16, and 17 (the solitary hand) well up the concave roof\u2014and all four beyond the floor line.\n\nTo get at these paintings it was necessary to construct a \"cantilever\" of jungle timber, firmly lashed to a stout iron cramp let into the rock floor. To the extremity of this projection was tied a rough \"cage\" of sticks; and from this uncomfortable and perilous perch Mr. Perera made his copies of the last and loftiest frescoes in \"pocket\" 'B.'\u2020\n\nEven more difficulty and danger attended the fixing of a hurdle-platform outside the extremely narrow and slippery ledge separating \"pocket\" 'B' from 'A' and onwards to the termination of 'A.' It took fully ten days to complete this messa, or stick-shelf\u2014only a few hands being induced by special remuneration to risk their lives on the job. In addition to 1-in. iron bars supporting the woodwork (the whole braced strongly to thick iron cramped into the rock),\n\n* Photographs C. 633, 634. \u2020 Photograph C. 785.\nthe hurdle had to be further held up by a central hawser and side ropes, hauled taut round trees on the summit of the Rock nearly 300 ft. up. When finished, this improvised platform stood out from the cliff 15 ft. horizontally.*\n\nOther \"pockets\" there are \"scooped within the living stone,\" further north along the western face of the Rock and higher up still. The larger of these were also plaster-coated and painted; but the colouring has disappeared almost entirely, and it is doubtful whether the caves themselves can now be reached in any way.\u2020\n\nIt is reasonable to conclude, from their being found in so inaccessible a spot, that the frescoes are merely the last remnants of a large number of similar paintings which covered the bare and perpendicular rock immediately above the terrace [gallery]. It is unlikely that the only frescoes should have been painted where they can be so hardly and so little seen; but they are found in almost the only part of the precipice protected partially from sun and rain, so that the destruction of any others that may have existed was inevitable.\"\u2021\n\nTo pass to the frescoes themselves.\n\nIn an \"Interim Report\" such as this, it is not possible to do full justice to these unique paintings. They demand special treatment in detail, and that I hope to give later.\n\nHere I must limit myself to a rapid general description, drawing attention merely to certain broad features which un through the frescoes as a group.\n\nIt is usual\u2014and convenient\u2014to style the Sigiriya paintings \"frescoes.\" But in reality\u2014like their coeval and even more remarkable congeners at Ajanta\u2014they have no claim to be thus honoured. Says Mr. Griffiths, when reporting to the Indian Government on the Ajanta paintings:\u2014\n\nThey are not \"frescoes\" in the true acceptation of the term; nor do they appear to correspond to the Italian fresco secco (where the entire surface of the wall was first prepared for painting on and then thoroughly saturated with lime water before the painting was commenced), as the groundwork upon which the paintings were executed would hardly admit of this treatment.\u00a7\n\n* Photographs C. 778\u201382. \u2020 See Plate (ante), \"Sigiri-gala, West face.\"\n\u2021 Rhys Davids, in Journal, R. A. S., vol. VII., Part X., 1875, p. 193.\n\u00a7 Ind. Ant., vol II., 1873, p. 153.\nLike the so-called \"frescoes\" at Ajanta, those of Sigiriya are strictly paintings in tempera, that is, the pigments used were mixed with some liquid vehicle and laid on a dry surface.\n\nThe groundwork at Ajanta\u2014\nAppears to be composed of cowdung, with an immixture of pulverized trap, laid on the roughish surface of the rock to a thickness varying from quarter to half inch. Over this ground was laid (the intonaco of) thin, smooth plaster, about the thickness of an egg-shell, upon which the painting was done.*\n\nAt Sigiriya\u2014and to support my examination I called in the aid of the most skilled Sinhalese \"sitiyaru\" (painters) from Nilagama, in the Matale District, the village upon which has devolved for centuries the hereditary \"service\" of renewing the paintings of the ancient cave vihar\u00e9s of Dambulla\u2014an analysis of the plaster showed a groundwork of tempered earth and kaolin of a reddish brown hue and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) in. in thickness, coated with at least two layers of white chunam, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) in. thick. The clay base, strengthened by the admixture of \"dahiyava,\" or paddy husk, and perhaps shreds of cocoanut fibre, was first put on by hand, the chunam coating being (as at the present day) smoothed over it with a trowel.\n\nOnly three pigments were used, yellow, red, and green,\u2020 though black seems to have been given a trial as background to one figure, No. 14 'B.' The particular shades of these colours predominating the paintings may best be realized from the modern corresponding media employed by Mr. Perera in copying them, viz., chrome yellow, yellow ochre, raw sienna, burnt sienna, raw umber, light red, Indian red, sap green, terra vert, lamp black, and flake white.\n\nThe entire omission of blue is very remarkable, and difficult to account for, as this colour enters freely into the sister paintings at Ajanta.\n\nNo one who chooses to carefully compare the Sigiriya\n\n* Ind. Ant., vol. II., 1873, p. 153.\n\u2020 \"I tried in vain to detect green on the Sigiri frescoes\" (Rhys Davids loc. cit., p. 210).\npaintings with those found in the Ajanta caves will fail to be convinced that artists trained in the same school, if not the very same hands, must have executed both Indian and Ceylon frescoes. The evidence to be drawn from dress and ornament, no less than from the quaint \"tricks\" of pose and colouring common to both alike, for differentiating race and complexion and representing expression, is irresistible.\n\nMr. Griffiths' remarks on the Ajanta frescoes apply equally to the Sigiriya paintings. He says:\n\nThe artists who painted them were giants in execution. Even on the vertical sides of the walls, some of the lines which were drawn with one sweep of the brush struck me as being very wonderful; but when I saw long, delicate curves drawn without faltering with equal precision upon the horizontal surface of a ceiling where the difficulty of execution is increased a thousandfold, it appeared to me nothing less than miraculous. One of the students when hoisted up on the scaffolding, tracing his first panel on the ceiling, naturally remarked that some of the work looked like child's work, little thinking that what seemed to him up there rough and meaningless, had been laid in by a cunning hand, so that when seen at its right distance every touch fell into its proper place.*\n\nMr. Griffiths continues:\n\nThe condition of mind in which these paintings were originated and executed must have been very similar to that which produced the early Italian paintings of the fourteenth century, as we find much that is in common. Little attention paid to the science of art\u2014regard had more to the truthful rendering of a story than to a beautiful rendering of it; not that they discarded beauty, but they did not make it the primary motive of representation. There is a want of aerial perspective\u2014the parts are delicately shaded, not forced by light and shade, giving the whole a look of flatness\u2014a quality desired in mural decoration.*\n\nElsewhere Mr. Griffiths dwells on the admirable drawing of heads and limbs, of ornament and dress, and specially of \"the true rendering of hair\u2014one of the most difficult things in the province of art\"\u2014praise fully borne out in the Ceylon frescoes of Sigiriya. A further marked feature of these ancient paintings is the predilection for the three-quarter face\u2014a characteristic that alone separates the level of art\n\n* Ind. Ant., vol. III., 1874, p. 26.\ndisplayed, *toto coelo*, from the weak conventional \"silhouettes\" of present-day Sinhalese artists. Of the twenty-two faces left in \"pockets\" 'A' and 'B' at Sigiri-gala only three are in profile.\n\nIn one essential particular do the figures of the Sigiriya frescoes differ from the generality of those in the paintings at Ajanta: the latter are usually shown at full length from head to foot; the Ceylon figures are all cut off short at the waist by cloud effects, no doubt to economize space\u2014a clever device, by which\u2014to slightly vary Milton\u2014\"more is meant than meets the eye\"; whilst the pose of the head and body, coupled with the action of the hands, conventionalised yet not unnatural, unmistakably convey the meaning the artist intended.\n\nIn some of the caves at Ajanta \"on different parts of the walls two layers of painting can be distinctly traced,\" and the painting is \"of two or even three periods.\"\n\nTwo coatings of colour are not unknown to the Sigiriya frescoes. A patch of the upper layer of chunam scaled off the green waist-cloth of figure No. 12 in \"pocket\" 'B' reveals an under-coating of crimson. For all we know\u2014or can know without completely wrecking the present frescoes\u2014this may signify nothing more than that a co-temporary artist was given a free hand to bring the ladies' dresses up to the \"latest Court fashions,\" or, perchance for some peccadillo, to put the fair penitent (as in the case of the second figure in \"pocket\" 'A' literally) under a cloud.\n\nThe frescoes still to be seen on the western face of Sigiri-gala (casual patches of colouring excepted) are found now only in the two rock chambers or \"pockets\" ('A', 'B') some 15 yards above the \"gallery\" floor at its south end. They consist of twenty-two half-figure portraits\u2014one and all female. Of these, five are in \"pocket\" 'A,' seventeen in the larger chamber 'B.' All have suffered more or less from nesting swallows and the clay-building mason bee, some terribly.\nIt is almost certain that there once existed three rows of such half-figures in \"pocket\" 'A' and four in 'B,' painted on the rock walls and projecting roof. Highest up in the first line remain the single hand (No. 17) and a very worn pair of figures (Nos. 15, 16); of the second row only faint traces here and there; to the third line belong frescoes Nos. 3 and 4 of 'A,' and Nos. 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14 of 'B'; whilst the fourth, or lowest, row is made up of Nos. 1, 2, and 5 of 'A,' and Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 13 of 'B.'\n\nThe figures in \"pocket\" 'B' are above life-size; those of 'A' smaller than the ordinary human form\u2014a divergence due to the proportionate wall-space available.\n\nThe scene intended to be portrayed would seem to be a procession of the queens and princesses of K\u00e1syapa's court, with their attendants, on the way to worship at the Buddhist vih\u00e1re at Pidur\u00e1-gala, the hill lying about a mile north of S\u00edgiriya. The figures are manifestly all moving in that direction, and the flowers held in their hands by the ladies, and carried after them by servant-maids, can hardly bear any other signification. Grouping in pairs is chiefly favoured throughout: usually queen or princess followed by a lady-in-waiting of the same, or kindred, blood, or by a dark-skinned maidservant of alien race. The latter (Nos. 4, 8, 11 of 'B') are given a greenish complexion\u2014a \"badge of servitude\" which clearly marks them off from the high-born dames, their mistresses, whether pale-yellow \"blondes\" or orange-hued \"brunettes\"\u2014all three coloured types reproduced frequently at Ajanta.\n\nMr. Murray noted correctly \"that the maid in each case has her bosom covered with a jacket similar to that worn by Tamil women at the present day.\" Of the ladies, he declares \"many are nude to the waist\"\u2014an assertion for which, it must be admitted, he had, prima facie, good grounds. As, however, I pointed out in my Report for last year\u2014\n\nA close examination confirms the counter-supposition (highly probable on other grounds) from the known penchant of Oriental sculptor and painter alike in bygone days for ultra-diaphanous\ngarments\u2014a \"strange conceit\" which artworks of ancient India amply illustrate.*\n\nThe Ajanta paintings abound in female forms apparently \"cloth\u00e9d on with chastity\" alone, but each in reality, like old Chaucer's Venus, \"kover\u00e9d wel\":\n\nRyght with a subtil keverchefe of Valence;\nThere was no thicker cloth of defence.\n\nEvery queen, princess, or court lady depicted in the Sigiriya frescoes is in reality modestly clothed in a coloured kambaya from the waist downwards, and above, in short-sleeved jacket of finest material\u2014\"a wondrous work of thin transparent lawn,\" so thin, indeed, that the painter has (as with figure No. 12) occasionally contented himself by indicating it only by a touch of orange colour at the neck.\n\nWhatever opinion be held as to scarcity of clothing, there can be but one regarding the redundancy of ornament affected equally by queen or serving-woman. Coronets, tiaras, aigrettes crown the head; flowers and ribbons adorn the hair; whilst ears, neck, breast, arms, and wrists are loaded with a plethora of the heaviest ornaments and jewelled gauds. Some of the gold necklaces are exceedingly chaste, and the emeralds and rubies worn so \"rich and rare\" that each, if real, would be worth a king's ransom.\n\nThe figures in \"pocket\" 'A' may have no connection with those of the larger cave, though both seem to represent the same scene painted by two different artists; for the rendering is as commonplace in the former as in the latter it is natural and spirited.\n\nThe paintings appear to have been first outlined in with red or black\u2014perhaps by an artist different from the finisher of the pictures. Be this as it may, it is certain that the second worker did not slavishly follow the original outlines\u2014indeed, the altered left hand of figure No. 8 'B' shows that at times he used his own discretion boldly.\u2020\n\n* C. A. S. Journal, vol. XIV., No. 47, 1896, p. 256.\n\u2020 Mr. Murray has been misled by this ultimate departure from the curves as first put in, and varied, into the assertion that to the hands \"have been added, in almost every case, an extra finger.\"\nThe type of features is Aryan\u2014oval face, thick fleshy lips, but straight, almost Grecian nose and forehead. The \"almond-eyes\" of No. 1 'B' betoken a slight tinge of Mongolian blood.\n\nI have styled these paintings \"portraits,\" and, I venture to think, with reason. Unable to cast himself loose from all conventionalism, particularly in the stiff disposition of arms and hands, the artist\u2014he, I mean, who executed the paintings in \"pocket\" 'B'\u2014has imbued each figure with certain delicate traits in face, form, pose, and dress, which stamp it, me judice, unmistakably as an individual likeness. So skilfully in truth has the portrait painter worked that it appears possible not merely to gauge approximately each lady's age, but even, in great degree, \"to find the mind's construction in the face.\"\n\nThese figures are no replicas of a flat, stereotyped image, \"mute fixtures on a stuccoed wall\"\u2014degenerate art that wearies the eye at many a modern Buddhist temple in Ceylon. Here they live, they move, they have a being; all is instinct with life and spirit.\n\nMark the fair princess (No.1 'B') who has purposely taken the lead in the procession with her lady-in-waiting (No. 2). That dainty head saucily tossed back surely betrays, plainer than words, full consciousness of her undoubted charms. In her own eyes the \"very pink of perfection,\" she essays to parade as \"the glass of fashion and the mould of form, the observed of all observers.\"\n\nFollowing her demurely at some distance is a second princess (No. 3), perhaps the staid elder sister, accompanied by a dusky maid of unattractive mien, carrying a rolled ola book.\n\nNext, come two more court attendants (Nos. 5, 6), manifestly importuning a matronly queen (No. 7) to hasten her steps. The impassiveness of the royal lady is admirably brought out by a slight, but expressive touch\u2014the deliberate unfolding, petal by petal, of a lotus bud she holds in her hands.\nOr observe the impulsive eagerness of No. 9, another lady-in-waiting, chafing at the delay and appealing to the queen immediately following (No.10), who with right hand uplifted gently checks her impetuosity.\n\nSucceeding No. 10, attended like Nos. 3 and 7 by a servant maid bearing a tray of flowers, is a princess of seventeen or eighteen years (No. 12), who may well be K\u00e1syapa\u2019s daughter. Excellently has the artist caught the young girl\u2019s\u2014\n\nEmbarrassed look of shy distress,\nAnd maidenly shamefacedness\n\non the occasion of this\u2014not improbably her initiation into a\u2014public Court procession.\n\nThe figure behind is perhaps her mother, the queen consort, from whose well-chiselled face \u201cDecay\u2019s effacing fingers\u201d have still not \u201cswept the lines where beauty lingers.\u201d\n\nLast of all, calm and sedate, walks the queen mother (No. 14) absorbed in silent meditation. Can we doubt that that fixed gaze and dreamy look sadly speak to \u201cthoughts too deep for tears\u201d\u2014a royal husband slain at Kal\u00e1-v\u0113wa; a son, his slayer, ruling, but not reigning, at S\u00edgiriya; to a \u201cpast\u201d no longer \u201csighed for, and a future sure.\u201d\n\nFinally, contrast the peaceful serenity of this queen dowager with the \u201ccrabbed age\u201d of the well-nigh repulsive beldame (No. 5) of \u201cpocket\u201d \u2018A,\u2019 or the vivacity and expression of figure No. 9 \u2018B\u2019 with the stolid blankness on the faces of the dark-hued serving maids, or slaves (Nos. 4, 8, 11)\u2014\n\nSo coldly sweet, so deadly fair,\nAll trace of soul is wanting there.\n\nOne word in conclusion. Who were the authors of these unique paintings? Were they executed by Sinhalese \u201csitiyaru,\u201d or by foreign artists brought over from the continent of India?\n\nFor myself, I make no doubt that they are the production of exotic talent specially imported by King K\u00e1syapa for the single object of adorning his incomparable citadel.\n\nThe case for the Sinhalese rests, I believe, on but two\nprops, both unreliable: first, the casual mention of oil painting in connection with the building and decoration of Ruwanv\u0113li D\u0101gaba by King Du\u1e6dugemunu about 80 B.C.; and secondly, the occurrence of one or two frescoes among the Ajanta paintings supposed to relate to Ceylon.\n\nCould evidence be more slender? Even if the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 record be held unimpeachable, what was there to prevent King Du\u1e6dugemunu from securing his artists from the continent? And as to the fancied Vijayan and other frescoes\u2014if, indeed, the scenes be accurately allocated to this Island\u2014the story of the migration to, and conversion of, Ceylon would be the common property of all Buddhists, whether of the northern (Mah\u0101yana) or southern (Hinayana) schools, and certain to find a place, with other Buddhistic legends, on the walls of the Ajan\u1e6da caves.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the stubborn fact that nowhere else in Ceylon have similar frescoes, or other paintings rising to so high a standard of art, been yet discovered. There is nothing to equal them in the fragments left on the altars of the Anur\u0101dhapura D\u0101gabas\u2014on the walls of the so-called \"Dem\u0101la-mah\u0101-s\u0113ya\" at Polonnaruwa\u2014or in the countless caves of the northern part at least of the Island. The best painting at Dambulla Vih\u0101r\u0113, barely 12 miles from Sigiriya\u2014a shrine famed for centuries before Sigiri-gala was occupied as a royal citadel\u2014is not on a par with the least successful of these frescoes.\n\nIntercourse with Buddhist India had for some length of time prior to the middle of the fifth century been, if not close, at least free and not slight. Nine reigns earlier, during the rule of Kirtti \u015ar\u012b Meghavar\u1e47a, an Indian prince and princess had brought over the Dalad\u0101, or Tooth-relic, to be in future enshrined in Ceylon. And it was to India that Moggall\u0101na resorted for the army which finally captured his brother's stronghold at Sigiriya.\n\nAnd strongest proof of all: no tradition exists that the skilled artists who executed the frescoes were Sinhalese; nor regarding the methods whereby these paintings have\npreserved their hues, despite the weathering of 1,400 years and upwards, with a freshness and brilliancy that is simply marvellous.\n\nIf the art of permanently \"fixing\" colours was ever indigenous to Ceylon, it is hardly reasonable to believe that it would have died out completely. In the East painters' guilds are among the oldest methods of painting, being jealously guarded and handed down from generation to generation with rigid conservatism. The Nilagama \"sitiyaru\" who closely examined them made no secret of the fact that the best modern work exposed to wind and sun, as are the Sigiriya frescoes, would not last twenty years.\n\nYet here still survives an imperishable monument of antiquity\u2014painting dating back well-nigh a millennium and a half.\n\nQuod non imber edax, non aquilo impotens\nPossit diruere, aut innumerabilis\nAnnorum series.\n\n4. His Excellency the Governor: I now invite any gentleman present to make any remarks, or ask any questions, which he may think desirable to make or ask, in order to elucidate, if necessary, the very able and lucid lecture we have just heard.\n\nAfter a pause\u2014\n\n5. Mr. J. Ferguson said the absence of the Acting Chief Justice, who was to have taken charge of the resolution, had entailed on him the duty of proposing a cordial vote of thanks to Mr. Bell for his interesting and instructive Paper.\n\nOld residents, like himself, who recalled Mr. Bell's presence amongst them in Colombo, realized his (Mr. Bell's) self-denial, when in the course of duty, and in his enthusiasm for archaeology, he had got banished to Anuradhapura. His labours there, year after year, under but half-hearted encouragement, were known to them all. Fortunately, greater interest and encouragement had been manifested under His Excellency's r\u00e9gime.\n\nNow Mr. Bell had come to tell them of Sigiriya, to whose exploration he had given portions of the past three years; and, to aid in bringing home to them the marvels of that Rock Fortress, was exhibiting a brilliant display of paintings, so well executed by his Draughtsman, Mr. Perera.\n\nHe was not prepared to find Mr. Bell so firmly declaring the Sigiriya frescoes were the work of Indian rather than Sinhalese artists; but\nthat view had been forced on himself by the contrast between what they saw around them on the walls this evening, in the variety as well as ability of the art displayed, and that presented by any of the paintings or illustrations elsewhere in Ceylon at the present day. The art at those Buddhist temples\u2014if art it could be called\u2014seemed (as with temple figures and illustrations in Egypt) to be stereotyped for 2,000 years.\n\nAs regards access to the summit, Mr. Bell knew of no more than a dozen Englishmen, all told, who had climbed the Rock previous to 1895; while he also incidentally mentioned that 20,000 persons at least had reached the top during the past three seasons\u2014so great was the improvement in the means of ascent.\n\nThey would hope that, under increasing encouragement, the Archaeological Survey\u2014with which Mr. Bell's name will ever be identified\u2014would progress satisfactorily, and that Mr. Bell would have many more Papers of interest to read to them.\n\nThey had to thank His Excellency and the Government for permitting the Paper to be read before the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nHe would now move that Mr. Bell receive a very hearty vote of thanks (applause).\n\n6. Mr. C. M. Fernando said that the very same accident which had made Mr. Ferguson propose the motion had obliged him to second it. And taken rather suddenly, he was sorry that he was not able to say as much as he should wish about Mr. Bell's work with regard to the Archaeological Survey of the Island. But this much he could say, that as a Sinhalese he was very thankful to Mr. Bell for helping to elucidate the ancient history of the country; and thankful to the Government of Ceylon for giving Mr. Bell the opportunity of doing so.\n\nHe might also be excused if he expressed satisfaction at those fine frescoes. Not only had the copies been done by a Sinhalese artist, but the originals, in his opinion, had been painted by Sinhalese themselves. Some two years ago, when Mr. Bell's work at Sigiriya first came before the Royal Asiatic Society, he (Mr. Fernando) had ventured to make the suggestion that these frescoes were drawn, not by \"exotic\" artists\u2014as Mr. Bell would have them understand\u2014but by Sinhalese artists.\n\nHe must say he had very slender material to substantiate that suggestion. Those materials were two copies of frescoes at Ajanta, and they related to the history of Ceylon. One of them depicted the introduction of Buddhism into Ceylon by Mahindu. Another fresco depicted the bringing of the Tooth-relic into the Island. The Ajanta paintings, Mr. Bell had said, closely resembled the figures they saw before them. He, therefore, hazarded the suggestion that it was not Tamil [sic] artists who came to Ceylon and painted those frescoes, but Sinhalese artists who went over to India (laughter). His Excellency might think that was rather a bold theory for a young man like\nhimself to formulate at a Meeting of that Society; but he did not think that his position had been shaken at all by anything that had been said that evening.\n\nHe was not aware of any frescoes in India which were of the same class of painting, except the frescoes at Ajanta; and until India could establish some other precedent, he thought he could claim the credit for the Sinhalese themselves. Apart from that fact, he had the authority of Sir Emerson Tennent for asserting that the earliest historical mention of oil painting was in the Mah\u0101v\u0101nsa. Tennent mentioned that the Warrior King built the Ruwanveli D\u0101gaba, and had frescoes painted on it in oil mixed with vermilion paint. The remains of those frescoes were still to be seen at the Ruwanveli D\u0101gaba, which was built some two thousand years ago.\n\nThe use of oil painting was only forgotten, not lost, in Ceylon. At least, the method of painting in oils was there, although the skill in the art was lost. If it was argued that the paintings of the present day were not of the class of those they saw exhibited to-night, it might be said in the same way that the Sinhalese did not build those monuments of engineering they saw in the great tanks and ruins in many parts of the Island, and that they were all built by Tamil, or \"exotic,\" engineers; because they had not the same Sinhalese engineers nowadays who could construct things in the same style. He asserted that the art of oil painting was known to the Sinhalese, and that even to this day an oil was extracted in certain parts of the Island which was used for painting. The extraction of the oil was done in a very primitive fashion, but the liquid as used made a very good colour. He trusted that some day speculative gentlemen would make use of the oil, or possibly that the Ceylon Observer would take it up (laughter).\n\nIn conclusion, he expressed his great thanks to Mr. Bell, and hoped that the good work he had begun would be continued; and that in course of time, when he went to unlooked-for places, he would find still further frescoes which would release him from the impression under which he was labouring in regard to the inartistic character of the ancient Sinhalese as regards painting.* He had much pleasure in seconding the motion.\n\n7. His Excellency the Governor, before putting the motion, said:\u2014My lord, ladies, and gentlemen: I now invite you by hearty acclamation to pass the vote of thanks to Mr. Bell which has been proposed and seconded. Mr. Ferguson and Mr. Fernando have evidently interpreted the feelings of this audience with the same accuracy and sympathy as Mr. Bell has the \"maiden meditation\" of the beautiful young ladies on the frescoes (laughter). [To Mr. Bell:\u2014\n\n* Mr Fernando subsequently reiterated his views in a letter to the Ceylon Standard, which called forth a reply from Mr. Bell. See Appendix.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nAs your official chief I was rather shocked for a moment at your intimate acquaintance with the feelings of these ladies, and I began to fear a Breach of Promise case until I remembered how very much older they were than yourself (renewed laughter). In conveying to you the thanks of this Society, the thought occurs to me\u2014How often have you received the thanks of this Chair; how often have you read Papers and done other useful work, and earned and received their thanks?] However, I have no doubt Mr. Bell has been well rewarded. I can imagine, enthusiastic as he is, how pleased he has been to break away from the trammels of \"red-tape\" which usually surround him, and escape from cold official control; when he finds himself in this hall of culture, in the presence of a sympathetic audience, how he must revel in delight. The icy douche, with which Government may occasionally quench his archaeological ardour, is forgotten: he can dream, he can build magnificent castles\u2014or shall we say d\u00e1gabas\u2014regardless of expense, knowing that he has the entire sympathy of his audience (laughter and applause).\n\nWell, I will not pursue the strain; but only repeat how much we have enjoyed the Paper which has been read, and how much we admire the effective way in which Mr. Bell has breathed life into what, in less skilful hands, would have been very dry bones (applause). I think this Society is to be congratulated upon having so valuable a Member, and the Government is to be congratulated on finding amongst the ranks of Civil Servants one so able, so capable, and, above all, so enthusiastic an archaeologist (applause).\n\nThe vote was carried with hearty acclamation.\n\n8. The Bishop of Colombo then rose and said:\u2014It falls to me at this late hour very briefly to give expression to that which is in the minds of us all, the desire to thank Your Excellency for your presence here to-night (hear, hear). We have not only this duty, but also that of welcoming you on the first occasion in the capacity of Patron of this Society (hear, hear). We value the patronage of our Governor, and feel that your presence is not only the means of attracting a larger company than usual to our Meetings, but is evidence of the interest that clings round this special gathering.\n\nI am very glad to think Your Excellency's presence to-day is in great measure, not merely to show your sympathy and to discharge your duty of patronage to this Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, but also to show your approbation of him whom I shall not hesitate to call \"our Mr. Bell\" (hear, hear). He belongs to you, Sir, as a servant of the Government, but he belongs by extraction to the Royal Asiatic Society (hear, hear, and laughter). And we hope we may be able to make further requisitions on him for services like those which he has performed this evening (hear, hear)\u2014services which demand such extraordinary combinations in himself and Mr. Perera. It has\nbeen shown that they require, not only minute scientific knowledge and accuracy, but heroic efforts, which belong rather to the sphere of the athlete, or even of the aeronaut!\n\nBut while we all join in the thanks to Mr. Bell, we welcome Your Excellency's presence as an encouragement to ourselves and the Society. We are not always fortunate to have at our Meetings the results of great discoveries, or very brilliant or highly coloured scenes. We labour very often in humble corners, and in work which has its usefulness, though very little brilliancy. From time to time we read a Paper on some such subject as some particular bird, its method of making its nest, or of the way of preparing fish for stuffing, or some such practical details as promote the advance of Science. We believe that these things are useful; and probably they are the larger part of the work the Society can do. It is only on \"field-days\" of this kind that the Meetings of the Society are graced by a large company: and Your Excellency's presence is valuable for the encouragement it affords to us in our work. I will conclude by proposing to this company a very hearty vote of thanks to Your Excellency (cheers).\n\n9. Mr. P. Freudenberg seconded the motion.\n\nThe vote having been received with acclamation\u2014\n\n10. His Excellency the Governor, in reply, said:\u2014My lord, ladies, and gentlemen: I am extremely obliged to you for the cordial reception you have given me: to you, my lord, for the very kind manner in which you have proposed this motion; to you, ladies and gentlemen, for the very kind manner in which you have received it. It is a great pleasure to me to be present to-night, and I feel that no thanks are due to me, but rather they are due from me, or they should be given to a more useful officer than the Patron\u2014to the President, Your Lordship, who for many years has kept alive the torch of this Society (hear, hear). I am glad, however, of this opportunity of thanking you for the offer to me of the great honour to make me the Patron of this Society. I recognize that the position is purely honorary, a sinecure, or else I should have hesitated much before I accepted it. At a Scientific Society such as this I do not feel at all at home, though it has my sympathies; in fact, I feel like the fly in amber, who wondered how on earth he got there (laughter).\n\nThis Society has been independent of Government, and the Government does not grudge it that position. It is a very proud position, and I wish there were some other institutions in the Colony which could indulge in a similar position. This Society has done, and continues to do, excellent work. I am glad to see such a large number present; and I hope you are all Members of the Society, but if you are not, I trust you will be speedily. You may be independent of Government, but Government is not independent of you. Much of the scientific work undertaken by the Government of Ceylon has been due to the\ninsistence of this Society, especially as regards Archaeology. If the Government has acted up to its responsibility as regards Archaeology, it is due to the exertions of the Ceylon Asiatic Society.\n\nI thank you very much for having received me so well, and for the honour you have conferred on me in making me a Patron to the Society. I hope I may again have the pleasure of attending your Meetings, not as Patron, but as a student sitting at your feet to receive instruction (cheers).\n\n11. The proceedings then ended, but many ladies and gentlemen lingered some time to examine the copies of the frescoes painted by Mr. Perera, and the plans, drawings, photographs, &c.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nThe Sigiriya Frescoes.\n\nTo the Editor, Ceylon Standard.\n\nSir,\u2014I had accepted the kind suggestion made by your contemporary, the Ceylon Observer, and had begun collecting materials for a Paper on oil-painting in general, both in ancient and modern Ceylon, when my attention was drawn to the remarks of two of your correspondents, and your own editorial comments on the subject. I would now point out that besides the frescoes at Polonnaruwa, there are to be found, at the present day, modern frescoes in nearly every vih\u00e2r\u00e2 in the Island, mostly descriptive of the incidents in the many lives of Gautama Buddha.\n\nWhat I understood Mr. Bell to say was that the Sigiriya frescoes were the only ones of the kind in the Island. In other words, that they formed a particular style of painting of their own, just as in Europe a picture of the Raphaelite school would differ in style from other paintings. The only frescoes of a similar style known to me are those in the Ajanta caves. These and the Sigiriya frescoes are co-temporaneous in date. Hence the conclusion, first put forward by me in 1895, and in which both Mr. Bell and I are agreed, that they represent the work of the same hands, or at least of the same school of artists. Taking this for granted, the question next arises as to whether this school consisted of artists from the Deccan, or of Sinhalese artists. This is the point of difference between Mr. Bell and myself.\n\nMr. Bell's Paper was not printed and circulated before its reading; and thus Mr. Bell's theory of \"exotic\" artists came as a surprise to me at the recent Meeting of the Asiatic Society. Otherwise I should have been in a position to deal more fully and exhaustively with his theory, which, after all, is a mere surmise, for he adduces no reasons in its support.\nIt will be admitted that, *caeteris paribus*, the credit of painting frescoes found in Ceylon must, *prima facie*, rest with the Sinhalese until the contrary is definitely established.\n\nBut, apart from this, I pointed to the significant fact that two of the frescoes at Ajanta, as pointed out by Fergusson and Manning, depict scenes from the *Mah\u0101wans\u0101*, the ancient chronicle of Lank\u0101. In fact, the absolute fidelity to detail as regards the introduction of Buddhism, and the preaching of Mahinda, can leave no doubt as to what was meant. Hence, I argued in favour of Sinhalese artists.\n\nMr. Bell made a point of the fact that the Sigiriya frescoes were the only ones of the kind in Ceylon. I replied by saying that those at Ajanta were just as unique as regards India; but omitted to notice that Mr. Bell had himself stated in his Paper that all the walls of the rock cave must originally have been covered with similar frescoes, of which the existing ones formed a very small portion, and that those only have escaped the ravages of time from the fact that they lay in so sheltered a position in the \"pockets\" of the rock temples. Thus, from Mr. Bell's own standpoint, there is nothing to prevent the supposition that these are the only existing frescoes of many that were painted, not only in Sigiriya, but in other places as well, in the fifth century of the Christian era.\n\nK\u0101\u015byapa was a prisoner-king. Betaking himself to the Rock Fortress of Sigiriya, he lay for eighteen long years in concealment, fearful of the vengeance of his brother Moggal\u0101na, from which he only escaped by the crime of suicide. It is difficult to understand the opportunities which this prisoner-king would have had to communicate with India, and to import therefrom \"exotic\" artists.\n\nThe presumption of \"exotic\" artists would imply that painting was the only art in which the ancient Sinhalese were lacking, great as they admittedly were in sculpture, architecture, engineering, &c.\n\nKing Dutugemunu (161 B.C. to 137 B.C.), after having defeated the Tamil invader El\u0101la, built the huge Ruwanveli (gold-dust) D\u0101gaba to commemorate his victory, and the *Mah\u0101wans\u0101* records that its walls were covered with pictures painted with \"vermilion paint mixed with tala (gingelly) oil.\" On this, the first known historical mention of oil-painting, Sir Emerson Tennent bases his claim to the discovery of oil-painting on behalf of the Sinhalese. To prove that the *Mah\u0101wans\u0101* recorded a fact, I make the following quotation from Burrows' description of this D\u0101gaba in the *Buried Cities of Ceylon*, p. 31: \"Many traces of the gaudy painting which formerly adorned (or disfigured) these altars may still be seen.\"\n\nIn the face of all these facts I may be excused if I fail to adopt Mr. Bell's theory of \"exotic\" artists.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. M. Fernando.\n\nTo the Editor, *Ceylon Standard*.\n\nSir,\u2014Some one has been good enough to send me a copy of your issue of the 20th instant, containing a letter by Mr. C. M. Fernando, and a short editorial paragraph, relating to the \"Sigiriya Frescoes.\"\n\nI note that Mr. Fernando has returned to the charge, in defence of his theory of Sinhalese authorship for the paintings at Sigiriya.\n\nI do not propose to enter here fully into the disputed question of their execution by native or foreign artists; this I hope to do later\nin my Archaeological Report on \"Sigiriya.\" I desire now merely to correct one or two inaccuracies into which Mr. Fernando has slipped.\n\nIt may be assumed once for all that the frescoes at Ajanta in India, and those on the Sigiriya Rock, were executed, if not by the same hands, at least by artists trained in the same school.\n\nMr. Fernando's arguments against the importation of \"exotic talent\" for the painting of the Sigiriya frescoes may best be quoted, and briefly touched on seriatim:\n\n(1) \"Ceteris paribus, the credit of painting frescoes found in Ceylon must, prima facie, rest with the Sinhalese.\"\n\nGranted: but \"other things are\" not \"equal\"; little Ceylon is not giant India; the field of selection for competent artists is about one to sixty.\n\n(2) \"Two of the frescoes at Ajanta, as pointed out by Fergusson and Manning [sic], depict scenes from the Mahavamsa, the ancient chronicle of Lanka.\"\n\nThe scenes referred to are\u2014(a) the supposed landing of Vijaya in Ceylon; and (b) the supposed introduction of Buddhism into the Island\u2014given by Mrs. Speir in her Life in Ancient India.\n\nAs regards (a), Mrs. Speir rightly remarks that the picture\u2014from the horse-worship introduced into it\u2014illustrates \"a northern adaptation of the story in the Mahavamsa, related in a Nepalese work of Avalokitesvara,\" who saved \"Sinhala\" (Vijaya) in the form of a horse. The Sinhalese have always belonged to the Hinayana (\"Lesser Vehicle\") school of Buddhism, which knows not Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisatva of the northern Mahayana, or \"Greater Vehicle.\" Much the same comment applies to (b). It may equally as well have been based on Northern Buddhist works as taken from the Mahavamsa of the Southern school\u2014if, that is, the painting has anything whatever to do with the meeting between Mahinda and King Devanampiya Tisa.\n\n(3) \"Mr. Bell made a point of the fact that the Sigiriya frescoes were the only ones of the kind in Ceylon. I replied by saying that those of Ajanta were just as unique as regards India.\"\n\nThe Ajanta paintings are not \"unique\" in the sense of the frescoes at Sigiriya. It is true that the former (as Fergusson records) \"represent Buddhist legends on a scale and with a distinctness found nowhere else in India.\" But there are other frescoes which in beauty of execution run them very close\u2014if, indeed, they do not surpass them; and which prove further that the art retained its full vigour for many centuries longer on the Indian continent. I refer to the wonderful paintings to be seen at Fatehpur-Sikri, near Agra, the \"royal abode\" of Akbar in the sixteenth century. Here, in Ceylon, we have nowhere else mural painting attaining the standard of art exhibited in the Sigiriya frescoes.\n\nAgain, had Kasyapa employed Sinhalese sitiyaru to adorn the walls of his marvellous citadel, it may reasonably be inferred that the services of the ancestors of the Nilagama guild of painters would have been enlisted: yet at this day no tradition even lingers among these hereditary craftsmasters, whose work at the ancient Dambulla cave temple goes back to an earlier date than the occupation of Sigiriya as a capital. Shown the Sigiriya frescoes in the \"pockets\" themselves last year, these Nilagama men declared their inability to\nexplain the process by which the colours have been permanently \"fixed,\" or to attempt to \"restore\" them in any degree.\n\n(4) \"Thus, from Mr. Bell's own standpoint, there is nothing to prevent the supposition that these are [not] the only existing frescoes of many that were painted, not only at Sigiriya but in other places as well, in the fifth century of the Christian era.\"\n\nNothing at all, as far as Sigiriya is concerned, but a great deal as regards \"other places\" throughout Ceylon. If I have examined one ancient cave vih\u0101r\u0113, &c., in the Central, North-Western, and North-Central Provinces, I have examined well nigh a thousand\u2014and any painting rivalling the art displayed in the Sigiriya frescoes I have still to find. The surface painting faintly traceable on the \"altars\" of some of the larger d\u0101gabas of Anur\u0101dhapura, on the walls of the so-called \"Demala-mah\u0101s\u0113ya\" at Polonnaruwa, or in the caves of Handa-gala and Dimbula-gala, is not devoid of merit, but belongs to a lower grade of art than the frescoes of Ajanta and Sigiriya.\n\n(5) Mr. Fernando harps on the allusion in the Mah\u0101vans\u0101 to the use of \"vermilion paint mixed with tala oil\" for the ornamentation of Ruvanveli D\u0101gaba when built by King Dutugemunu (first century B.C.) and quotes Sir Emerson Tennent in support of the \"claim to the discovery of oil-painting on behalf of the Sinhalese,\" upon this single shred of not too reliable evidence.\n\nVery good: let us admit, for the moment, that the honour of the discovery actually rests with the Sinhalese,\u2014though it really needs considerably more proof; let us go further and assume that Dutugemunu did not go to the continent of India for his artists\u2014as, for all the Mah\u0101vans\u0101 tells us, he well may\u2014what then? He must be a bold man that would assert that the descendants of the Sinhalese (if Sinhalese they were) who painted the Anur\u0101dhapura D\u0101gaba \"altars\" were capable of designing, and carrying out, the life-like frescoes of Sigiriya. Moreover, as is well known, Oriental art is strongly conservative\u2014follows slavishly stereotyped forms and methods. Is it probable\u2014is it even possible\u2014that the art of fresco-painting among the Sinhalese could have risen to the high level of Sigiriya in the fifth century, and gradually degenerated into the travesty which offends the eye and excites ridicule at the modern Buddhist temples of Ceylon?\n\n(6) \"K\u0101syapa was a prisoner-king. Betaking himself to the Rock Fortress of Sigiriya, he lay for eighteen long years in concealment, fearful of the vengeance of his brother Moggall\u0101na, from which he only escaped by the crime of suicide. It is difficult to understand the opportunities which this prisoner-king would have had to communicate with India, and to import therefrom 'exotic' artists.\"\n\n\"Prisoner-king,\"\u2014presumably a sort of \"ticket-of-leave\" prince; allowed by the considerateness of a younger brother to have for only \"eighteen long years\" the run of the Island, provided he kept in decent \"concealment.\" To K\u0101syapa's credit, be it said, he behaved exceedingly well during his period of \"probation\"; he committed no more murders; he did not worry Moggall\u0101na (who, by the way, appears to have found it \"convenient\" to cross over to India, so as not to embarrass his elder brother in the least); he merely amused himself by erecting, at vast labour and expense, a magnificent royal citadel\u2014just to show what honest \"concealment\" meant. Of course, under such conditions, intercourse with India would be quite impossible.\n(7) \"The presumption of 'exotic' artists would imply that painting was the only art in which the ancient Sinhalese were lacking, great as they admittedly were in sculpture, architecture, engineering,\" &c.\n\nThis opens up a far wider question, and one that must not be \"begged.\" Is Mr. Fernando prepared to prove that the Sinhalese were \"great\" in \"sculpture, architecture, engineering,\" &c.? Will he favour the Asiatic Society with a Paper on \"The Characteristics of the Sinhalese style of Ancient Architecture, as distinct from the Buddhistic and Dravidian styles found in India\"? I do not say the task is impossible; but it is not to be undertaken hastily. At present there is much ground for the supposition that the Sinhalese kings imported skilled artisans from the continent to execute very many of the ancient monuments of Anur\u00e1dhapura, Polonnaruwa, &c., commonly attributed to the Sinhalese. Few are the forms of building and sculpture which cannot be easily traced to an Indian source.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAnur\u00e1dhapura, January 22, 1898.\n\nH. C. P.

Mr. Joseph read the following\u2014\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1897.\n\nThe Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society have the honour to submit the following Report for the year 1897:\n\nMEETINGS.\n\nFive General Meetings of this Society have been held during the year, at which the following Papers were read and discussed, viz.:\n\n(1) \"Interim Report on the Operations of the Archaeological Survey of Sigiriya (Second Season), 1896,\" by H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S., Archaeological Commissioner.\n\n(2) \"Contributions to Ceylon Malacology,\" by O. Collett, F.R.M.S.\n\n(3) \"Ancient Cities and Temples in the Kurun\u00e9gala District: IV., Dambadeniya,\" by F. H. Modder.\n\n(4) \"A Geological and Mineralogical Sketch of the North-Western Province,\" by F. H. Modder.\n\n(5) \"Some Illustrations from the Fauna of Ceylon of Wallace's Theory of Natural Selection,\" by A. Haly, Director, Colombo Museum.\n(6) \"Interim Report on the Operations of the Archaeological Survey of Sigiriya (Third Season), 1897,\" by H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S., Archaeological Commissioner.\n\nMEMBERS.\n\nDuring the past year five new Members were elected, viz., G. C. Lee, H. B. Preston, J. E. Addyman, J. W. Small, and N. Balasubramanyan, M.A. The Council note with satisfaction that applications continue to be received for admission as Members.\n\nSix Members resigned, viz., J. Alexander, B. W. Bawa, S. Bois, L. d'Espagnac, Dr. M. N. Gandevia, and P. E. Radley.\n\nThe Society now has on its roll 188 Members, including 17 Life Members and 9 Honorary Members. Your Council has decided to recommend that Mr. H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S., Archaeological Commissioner, be appointed an Honorary Member of the Society in recognition of the valuable services rendered by him for a period of seventeen years, and his name will be submitted at the Annual General Meeting for election.\n\nThe Council record with regret the death of the following Members:\u2014S. Nagalingam, Advocate, and Hugh Nevill, C.C.S., F.Z.S.\n\nBy the death at Hy\u00e8res on April 10 of Mr. Hugh Nevill the Society has been deprived of an energetic and valuable Member, and Science has lost an enthusiastic worker in many fields. Mr. Nevill was an indefatigable collector. He had discovered and described many new species in Zoology, and had contributed many specimens to Museums. His collection of birds passed to the late Marquis of Tweedale, but he left a very complete collection of certain genera of shells. For some years Mr. Nevill edited and published at his own cost \"The Taprobanian.\" Mr. Nevill has left what is probably a unique collection of specimens of the ancient Kandyan silver work, an art which he took an active part in reviving. Mr. Nevill, from his intimacy with Buddhist priests and other native scholars, had unusual facilities for collecting manuscripts, and left behind a most valuable collection of ancient Buddhist and Pali manuscripts. A Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of these was prepared for publication, and the late Dr. Rost of the India Office was anxious that it should be published. The catalogue is complete: Mr. Nevill took it with him in order to superintend its publication in England; but was unable to rally from the illness that had necessitated his leaving Ceylon.\n\nMr. Nevill joined the Society in 1865. He contributed to the Society's Proceedings the following Papers:\n\n(1) Description of Two Birds new to the recorded Fauna of Ceylon (Vol. IV., No. 14).\n\n(2) Description of a New Genus and Five New Species of Marine Univalves from the Southern Province, Ceylon (Vol. IV., No. 14).\n\n(3) Notes on the Geological Origin of South-Western Ceylon (Vol. V., No. 16).\n\n(4) Further Notes on the Ornithology of Ceylon (Vol. V., No. 16).\n\n(5) The Ancient Emporium of K\u00e1lah, &c., with Notes on Fa-Hian's Account of Ceylon (Vol. VII., No. 24).\nThe following is a list of his principal writings:\n\n1. On some New Marine Gastropoda from the Southern Province of Ceylon (Journ. Ben. As. Soc., XXXVIII., Part II.).\n2. Descriptions of Marine Gastropoda from Ceylon (Journ. Ben. As. Soc., XXXVIII., Part III.).\n3. Note on Onchidium Verruculatum, Cuv., from Ceylon (Proc. Ben. As. Soc., 1870).\n4. New Marine Mollusca from the Indian Ocean (Journ. Ben. As. Soc., XLIII., Part II.).\n5. New Marine Mollusca from the Indian Ocean (Journ. Ben. As. Soc., XLIV., Part II.).\n6. Oriental Studies (Parts I. and II.), 2 vols.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe additions to the Library during the year numbered 203 volumes. The acquisitions are chiefly exchanges received from Societies. The Library is indebted for donations to the following:\u2014The Trustees of the Indian Museum; the Government of Bengal; A. Mendis Gunasekera; R. Narayan Apte; the Government of India; the Hon. Mr. Justice Lawrie; J. P. Lewis, C.C.S.; the Government of Ceylon; the Government of Madras; the Government of Bombay; the Secretary of State for India in Council; H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S.; the Colombo Museum; J. B. Chapman; the Director of Public Instruction, Batavia; the Geological Survey of Canada; the Director of State Archives, the Hague; the Government of North-Western Provinces and Oudh.\n\nFor valuable exchanges received during the year the Society is indebted to the following:\u2014The American Oriental Society; the Buddhist Text Society of India; Bijdrajen tot de Ta\u00e1l-Land en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indie, the Hague; the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland; the Royal Society of Victoria; the Geological Society of London; the Smithsonian Institution; K. K. Naturhistorischen Hofmuseums, Vienna; the Musee Guimet, Paris; Deutsche Morgenlandische Gessellschaft, Leipzig; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Imperiale des Naturalistes de Moscou; the Anthropological Society of Great Britain and Ireland; the Bureau of Education, Washington; the Anthropological Society of Bombay; the Pekin Oriental Society; the Asiatic Society of Bengal; the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; the Royal Colonial Institute; the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; the University of Upsala; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Zoologique, Paris; Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, Batavia; the Royal Society of New South Wales; the Asiatic Society of Japan.\n\nThe Council desire to draw the attention of the Government to the remarks made in previous Annual Reports regarding inadequate accommodation for its Library. The need of sufficient room for books has been much felt for some years now\u2014a need which Government has admitted. An extension of the building will alone meet the emergency, and it is hoped the long-deferred extension will be shortly undertaken. The Committee of the Colombo Museum, recognizing the congestion now apparent everywhere in the Library, recommended the extension of the eastern wing of the Museum, and a sum of Rs. 40,000 was voted for the purpose in 1891, but owing to some disagreement as regards\nthe particular plan of extension to be adopted, the money was allowed to lapse to revenue. Both the Museum Library and that of the Asiatic Society require additional space, not only for present requirements, but to allow for future development.\n\n**Journals.**\n\nOne number of the Journal has been published during the year (Vol. XIV., No. 47, 1896), which contains, in addition to the Proceedings of the Council and General Meetings, the following Papers:\n\n(i.) \"Legislation in Ceylon in the early portion of the Nineteenth Century,\" by H. White, C.C.S.\n\n(ii.) \"On a Curious Nematoid Parasite from the Stomach of a Ceylon Insect (*Mantis Religiosa*),\" by O. Collett, F.R.M.S.\n\n(iii.) \"How the last King of Kandy was captured by the British,\" by T. B. Pohath.\n\n(iv.) \"Ancient Cities and Temples in the Kurun\u00e9gala District: II., Rid\u00ed Vih\u00e1r\u00e9,\" by F. H. Modder.\n\n(v.) \"The Inauguration of the King in Ancient Ceylon,\" by C. M. Fernando, B.A., LL.B.Cantab., M.R.A.S.Eng.\n\n(vi.) \"Ancient Cities and Temples in the Kurun\u00e9gala District: III., Panduwas Nuwara,\" by F. H. Modder.\n\n(vii.) \"Robert Knox's Sinhalese Vocabulary,\" by D. W. Ferguson.\n\n(viii.) \"Place Names in the Va\u1e47\u1e47i,\" by J. P. Lewis, C.C.S.\n\n(ix.) \"Reland on Malay, Sinhalese, and Tamil,\" by J. P. Lewis, C.C.S.\n\n(x.) \"Note on the Fortifications of Y\u00e1pahuwa,\" by J. Harward, M.A.\n\n(xi.) \"Interim Report on the Operations of the Archaeological Survey at S\u00edgiriya (Second Season), 1896,\" by H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S., Archaeological Commissioner.\n\nThe Journal for 1897 is nearly complete, and will be issued shortly. The Council still constantly receive applications from Societies and Institutions for exchanges or for donations of our Journal. These applications, though in some cases the Council have been obliged to refuse owing to their number, yet afford gratifying testimony of the increasing appreciation entertained for the publications of the Society.\n\nThe Council trust that it will be possible to have further reprints made of the early issues of the Journal, as these numbers are very scarce and the demand for them great.\n\n**Archaeology.**\n\nIt is with feelings of satisfaction that the Council refer to the progress that has been made during the year in the systematic survey of the archaeological remains of the Island.\n\nThe Council again acknowledge indebtedness to the Archaeological Commissioner for a *resume* of the work performed by the Archaeological Survey last year.\n\n**General.**\n\nThe vote for 1897 was Rs. 34,620, including salaries; this, as in 1896, proved sufficient for only nine months' field work. Application made to the Government for a supplementary vote of Rs. 5,000 was favourably met, permitting the Archaeological Commissioner to carry on excavations uninterruptedly to the end of the year.\nAnur\u00e1dhapura.\n\nIn Anur\u00e1dhapura excavations were continued at Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma, at \"El\u00e1la's Tomb,\" and at Puliyanku\u1e37am.\n\nTh\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma Ruins.\n\nWith the completion of the buildings immediately surrounding Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma D\u00e1gaba, the labour force was divided into two parties, one continuing to unearth the countless boundary walls and ruins scattered between Th\u00fap\u00e1r\u00e1ma and Ruwanveli on the south in the \"park,\" which is bounded east and west by the \"Sacred Road\" and Basawakkulam tank; the other, set to start work within the supposed \"Royal Enclosure,\" at the solitary brick building of Polonnaruwa type and pillared sites adjoining it that are situated in unfelled jungle a quarter mile north of the \"Inner Circular Road.\" As usual, it was found that for one building barely traceable above ground, half a dozen came to light as trenches ran onwards.\n\nEl\u00e1la Sohona.\n\nThe wide trenches begun in 1896 from north and east into the wooded hillock commonly styled \"El\u00e1la's Tomb,\" have been pushed on until the brick wall of some structure (apparently of d\u00e1gaba form) has been struck, where the cutting gives a vertical height of 60 ft.\n\nProgress at this mound is necessarily slow, owing to the limited space for working, the constant danger from falling talus, and the difficulty of getting rid of \"spoil.\"\n\nPuliyanku\u1e37am Ruins.\n\nAfter finishing, cleanly, the d\u00e1gaba and three vih\u00e1r\u00e9s within the inner quadrangular temenos, the gang working here attacked the group of three or four ruins lying to the north of \"MacBride's Deviation,\" near the large pokuna. At this point digging is tedious and laborious work; for the site is thickly covered with trees, and the buildings were originally constructed of brick and mortar (now caked into a hard concrete), rising from bold stone basements, buried 4 ft. to 5 ft. below the present surface of the ground. The largest building has still to be examined; but it is evident that this cluster\u2014wanting at Vijay\u00e1rama the sister establishment\u2014contains the chief residence of the monks of the Puliyanku\u1e37ama monastery.\n\nSigiriya.\n\nThe results of the third season's work at S\u00edgiriya have been recently laid before the Society in the Archaeological Commissioner's \"Interim Report on the Operations of the Archaeological Survey, 1897,\" placed at the Society's disposal by Government. Briefly, the excavation of the citadel on the summit of Sigiri-gala was rounded off by the laying bare of the rooms, &c., along the western edge, the remaining sixteen of the unique frescoes in the \"pockets\" above the \"gallery\" faithfully reproduced on canvas, and the topographical survey of the ancient city (Sigiri-nuwara) extended so as to include all outlying bunds, &c.\n\nA final season at S\u00edgiriya in 1898 will be devoted to excavations at the base of the rock and its entourage.\nCircuit Work.\n\nA very successful tour, on foot, of nine weeks' duration, was accomplished during August, September, and October, in the course of which practically the whole of Tammana\u1e0duwa was explored to its uttermost confines. The unseasonable rains that fell in August and September greatly incommode exploration and hampered the march in a district where numerous streams rapidly become unfordable from sudden freshets.\n\nStarting on August 16 from Alut-oya the expedition proceeded south-east through Dimbulanka\u1e0dawala, Minn\u00e9riya, T\u00f3p\u00e1v\u0113wa (Polon-naruwa), D\u00e1stota\u2014where the Mah\u00e1weli-ganga was crossed\u2014Yakkur\u00e9, and Huruvila, to Ku\u1e0da-ulpota at the foot of Dimbulu-gala. Nearly a week was spent in the examination of the ancient caves, &c., occurring on the slopes of this majestic hill, \"Gunner's Quoin,\" a well known landmark to vessels coasting round the east of the Island. To the east of Dimbulu-gala lies the Vedir\u0101\u1e6da of Tammana\u1e0duwa\u2014a wild waste, uninhabited, save by a few miserable \"clans\" of \"Village Vedd\u00e1s.\" The furthest of these Vedd\u00e1 hamlets, Kohomba\u1e37\u0113wa, is placed on the right bank of the M\u00e1dara-oya, 20 miles beyond the Mah\u00e1weli-ganga, and about 100 miles from Anur\u00e1dhapura at the extreme south-east corner of the North-Central Province. Turning north, homewards, from this limit, on September 17, down the M\u00e1dara-oya, through Belanwala and Ginidamana (Vedd\u00e1s) to Muttugala, and re-crossing the river at Kandak\u00e1\u1e0du, the rest of the journey lay northeast via Sungavali, Paliyagodella, into the Kal\u0119gam pattu (W\u00e1d\u00edgeva and Nikav\u0113wa), until the Trincomalee road was reached again on October 6 at Kanthalai.\n\nMany places of considerable arch\u00e6ological interest have been mapped and examined as the outcome of this long circuit, and an addition beyond expectation made to the existing list of the lithic inscriptions of Ceylon.\n\nMiscellaneous.\n\nIn 1895 the Asiatic Society handed over to the Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner the balance of an old \"Anur\u00e1dhapura Excavation Fund,\" to be expended in the partial restoration of the ruined \"Buddhist Railing\" at Anur\u00e1dhapura. This work has at length been completed by the Public Works officers, to whom it was entrusted; and the \"Railing,\" as restored, is among the most strikingly beautiful specimens of ancient architecture to be seen anywhere throughout the Island.\n\nCouncil.\n\nTwo Members of the Council of 1896, viz., Messrs. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than and H. F. Tomalin, A.R.I.B.A., being by virtue of Rule 16 deemed to have retired by least attendance, the vacancies were filled by the appointment of Messrs. J. P. Lewis, C.C.S., and F. H. de Vos, Advocate. Messrs. Fre\u00fcdenberg and F. M. Mackwood, who under the same Rule vacated their places by reason of seniority, were re-elected. Mr. A. Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum, was appointed to fill the vacancy in the Council caused by Dr. Trimen's death.\n\nMr. J. Harward (one of the Honorary Secretaries of the Society) was obliged to leave the Island in October last owing to ill-health, and tendered his resignation. The Council, however, decided not to\nremove his name from the list of Office-Bearers for 1897. The Council regret the cause of Mr. Harward's leaving Ceylon, and trust they will not lose his services in the future as an Honorary Secretary of the Society.\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, and Messrs. F. H. Price, C.C.S., and P. Freudenberg, Members of the Council, were absent from the Island for a few months during the year.\n\nFINANCES.\n\nThe Treasurership was resumed by Mr. F. C. Roles in February on his return to the Island, Mr. F. Lewis having kindly acted during the preceding four months.\n\nIt will be noticed that the balance has fallen from Rs. 915.82 to Rs. 831.50, but the year has been an unfavourable one for collecting subscriptions, owing partly to the special calls on Members for the Indian Famine Fund and for the Record Reign celebrations. The Treasurer has not submitted a list of defaulters, believing that with extended time most of them will be able and willing to pay up their arrears.\n\nMr. E. Booth has been good enough to again perform the duty of auditing the accounts.\n\nCO-OPERATION OF MEMBERS.\n\nIn conclusion, the Council observe with much satisfaction that the Society continues to promote the objects for which it was instituted. The Council invite the co-operation of Members in the work of the Society, and would welcome suitable Papers in any of the lines of study which it is the aim and object of the Society to encourage.\nBalance Sheet for the Year ended December 31, 1897.\n\n| RECEIPTS                                      | Rs. c. |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Balance in hand on December 31, 1896          | ...    |\n| Sale of Journals                              | 282 75 |\n| Entrance Fees                                 | 36 75  |\n| Annual subscriptions:                         |        |\n| 1892                                          | 10 50  |\n| 1893                                          | 42 0   |\n| 1894                                          | 52 50  |\n| 1895                                          | 89 25  |\n| 1896                                          | 157 50 |\n| 1897                                          | 687 75 |\n|                                               | 1,039 50 |\n| Government grant for 1897                     | 500 0  |\n|                                               | 2,774 82 |\n\n| EXPENDITURE                                   | Rs. c. |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Books account                                 | 73 26  |\n| Printing account (Journal)                    | 781 41 |\n| Charges account (clerk's salary, binding, general printing, stationery, advertising, postage, Public Hall meeting, and sundries) | 1,088 65 |\n| Balance at Bank of Madras                     | 831 50 |\n|                                               | 2,774 82 |\n\nAudited and found correct:\nE.

The Chairman said that the Council had tried\u2014and he hoped successfully\u2014to lay before Members all that had occurred since the last Annual General Meeting. There had been named the losses that had been sustained and the successes which had attended the Meetings of the Society. The financial condition of the Society had also been placed before them; and they had also been told of the work the Archaeological Commissioner had done. It now remained for him as Chairman to ask any Member of the Society present to criticise, or to approve, of what had been put before them by the Council.\n\n5. Mr. C. M. Fernando remarked that after what had fallen from the Chair much did not remain to be said. He moved that the Report and Balance Sheet be adopted.\n\nHe would commend more especially to the attention of the Meeting the sympathetic reference which the Report contained to the loss the Society has suffered by the death of Mr. Hugh Nevill. Mr. Nevill was known as an Orientalist, not only in Ceylon, but in Europe and America: here he had been known to them not merely as an English gentleman, but as a not unsuccessful student of the native languages. He revelled in the past history of Ceylon, and had striven hard to bring out the very intimate connection between Ceylon and India.\n\nWith the work of the Archaeological Commissioner referred to in the Report, they all sincerely sympathized (hear, hear), and they trusted that the Government would help it more than it was doing at the present moment. It called loudly for further encouragement and assistance by the Government. They had the authority of very many who understood the subject, that at the rate the work was progressing now it would take a very long time before the Archaeological Survey was finished.\n\n6. Dr. W. G. Vandort seconded the motion, which was carried.\n\n7. Mr. Roles moved that a copy of the paragraph in the Report referring to the lack of accommodation at the Museum should be forwarded to the Government. The matter had been mentioned in previous Reports, and the Museum authorities also referred to it; but hitherto the Society had been content to let it simply appear on its records. He thought it would be well to specially invite the attention of Government towards the pressing want, instead of leaving it simply to appear in this Report.\n\n8. The Chairman in concurring with Mr. Roles added that the paragraph was as follows:\n\n\"The Council desire to draw the attention of the Government to the remarks made in previous Annual Reports regarding inadequate accommodation for its Library. The need of sufficient room for books has been much felt for some years now\u2014a need which Government has admitted. An extension of the building will alone meet the emergency, and it is hoped the long-deferred extension will be shortly undertaken. The Committee of the Colombo Museum, recognizing the congestion now apparent everywhere in the Library, recommended the extension of the eastern wing of the Museum, and a sum of Rs. 40,000 was voted for the purpose in 1891, but owing to some disagreement as regards the particular plan of extension to be adopted, the money was allowed to lapse to revenue. Both the Museum\nLibrary and that of the Asiatic Society require additional space, not only for present requirements, but to allow for future development.\"\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Honorary Secretary do address the Government, as suggested.\n\n9. On a motion proposed by Mr. J. A. Henderson, and seconded by Dr. W. H. de Silva, the following gentlemen were elected as Office-Bearers for 1898:\n\nPresident.\u2014The Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of Colombo.\n\nVice-Presidents.\u2014The Hon. Mr. Justice A. C. Lawrie and Mr. Staniforth Green.\n\nCouncil.\n\nMr. O. Collett, F.R.M.S.  \nMr. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.  \nMr. J. Ferguson.  \nMr. C. M. Fernando, B.A., LL.B. Cantab.  \nMr. P. Fre\u00fcdenberg.  \nMr. A. Haly.  \n\nMr. F. M. Mackwood.  \nMr. F. H. Modder.  \nMr. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than, C.M.G.  \nMr. W. P. Ran\u00e1sinha.  \nMr. E. S. W. Sen\u00e1thi R\u00e1j\u00e1.  \nDr. W. G. Vandort.\n\nHonorary Treasurer.\u2014Mr. F. C. Roles.\n\nHonorary Secretaries.\u2014Mr. H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S.; Mr. J. Harward, M.A.; and Mr. G. A. Joseph.\n\n10. The Chairman explained that owing to ill-health Mr. Harward had resigned the Honorary Secretaryship; but the Council had prevailed on him to retain it on the understanding that he was not expected to read Papers. The only new Member of Council was Mr. Modder, who took an enthusiastic interest in that part of the Island (Kurun\u00e9gala) in which he lived, and had been a valuable contributor to the Society's proceedings.\n\n11. The Chairman:\u2014I beg to move, on the recommendation of the Council, that Mr. H. C. P. Bell, the Archaeological Commissioner, be elected an Honorary Member in recognition of the valuable services rendered by him to the Society during a period of seventeen years.\n\nI think it is right I should move this from the Chair (hear, hear), and ask you to adopt the suggestion of the Council, and adopt it, I hope, cordially and unanimously (hear, hear). Mr. Bell's services to the antiquities and archaeology of Ceylon are well known to all of us; there is no man who has done so much continuously and usefully as he has done in that direction. His ability to do the work was recognized long ago by the Government in selecting him from the ranks of the Civil Service as the man most capable of undertaking the direction of the Archaeological Survey of the Island; and the zeal with which he has carried those works on, the ability and knowledge he has applied to them, have been recognized by all. The Council have felt it fitting that what he has done should be recognized by the Society in this small manner,\u2014for it is a small way, but that is the only way we have at our command,\u2014viz., by recommending that he be made an Honorary Member of this Society for the remainder of his life (hear, hear).\n\n12. Mr. P. Fre\u00fcdenberg:\u2014I have much pleasure in seconding the motion. Much praise has been bestowed upon Mr. Bell, so I shall not praise him myself. I desire to congratulate him on his success in what\nto him, we know, is a work of love, and which has properly singled him out, not only for the recognition of men of Science, but also for the admiration of those who, like myself, are glad to listen to words of thought. I trust that it may be for long years Mr. Bell\u2019s lot to be able to devote himself to his favourite task with undiminished vigour of mind and body, and that this Society will long continue to be proud of him as one of its ablest Members (hear, hear).\n\n13. Mr. C. M. Fernando said he did not wish to give a silent vote because he had the misfortune to differ from Mr. Bell on a very little minor point of detail. It was a very little minor point, regarding the nationality of the artists who painted certain frescoes at Sigiriya about fourteen hundred years ago. As a Member of the Society he wished to state publicly that there was no one who appreciated Mr. Bell\u2019s services more than he did. The Society had done what was only fitting in recognizing in some small measure Mr. Bell\u2019s services. Mr. Bell was a very modest man; but that should not prevent them from showing their appreciation of his eminent and heartily rendered services.\n\nThe motion was carried with acclamation, and the Meeting terminated.\n\n14.

Haly, seconded by Mr. Cochran.\n\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, April 1, 1898.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, in the Chair.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Justice A. C.

Read a letter from Mr. H. C. P. Bell, C.C.S., tendering his thanks for the honour done him by his election as Honorary Member of the Society.\n\n5. Laid on the table a Paper by Mr. O. Collett, F.R.M.S., being No. 2 of the series on \"Contributions to Ceylon Malacology,\" entitled \"Description of a new Helicoid Land Shell from the Southern Province.\"\n\nOn the approval and recommendation of Dr. W. G. Vandort and Mr. A. Haly,\u2014\nResolved,\u2014To accept the Paper for reading at a Meeting of the Society.\n\n6. Laid on the table a letter from the Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, forwarding a copy of the Eighth Annual Report, and requesting an exchange of publications.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden be thanked for his letter and copy of the Eighth Annual Report, but that he be informed that in view of the large number of Institutions already on the exchange list, the Council have decided to limit the number of exchanges, and so regret that they cannot see their way to exchange. Decided further to forward the publication and the letter to the Superintendent of the School of Agriculture.\n\n7. Resolved,\u2014That the selection of a Clerk to succeed Mr. H. M. Gunasekera be left in the hands of the Honorary Treasurer and the Honorary Secretaries, and that they do engage a man provisionally on probation pending confirmation by the Council.\n\n8. Laid on the table a letter from Mr. F. H. de Vos asking that some person may be employed \"to make copies of the Dutch Epitaphs and Sketches of the Arms\" in the Pettah Burial Grounds, to illustrate a Paper that he is preparing for the Society.\n\nMr. J. Ferguson informed the Council that Mr. Foenander, late of the Survey Department, would probably be able to do the work required by Mr. de Vos.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Honorary Secretary do write to Mr. Foenander on the subject, and that Mr. de Vos be requested to visit the Pettah Burial Ground and select such tombstones as he wishes reproduced.\n\n9. Laid on the table a letter from Mr. J. P. Lewis forwarding \"Notes on some of the Papers published in the Journal for 1896,\" and suggesting that they be printed in the Journal as an adjunct to the Papers and Speeches.\n\nResolved,\u2014That Mr. J. P. Lewis be thanked for his suggestion and for forwarding the \"Notes,\" but that he be informed that under the regulations guiding the Council in this matter the \"Notes\" are inadmissible, and cannot therefore be accepted.\n\n10. Laid on the table an application from the Archaeological Commissioner for the sum of Rs. 61-24, being actual travelling expenses incurred in proceeding to Colombo to be present at the Meeting of the Society at which his \"Interim Report\" on Sigiriya (1897) was read.\nResolved.\u2014That the Arch\u00e6ological Commissioner be informed that the Council regret their inability to comply with his request, as it will establish a precedent to similar claims.\n\n11. Considered the advisability of translating a Manuscript by Cornelis Taay Wezel, dated 1713, containing an account and description of the peculiarities, nature, and breeding of elephants in Ceylon, with an account of how they are tracked, caught, stalled, tamed, sold, &c.\n\nMr. Joseph stated that Mr. F. H. de Vos considered that the Manuscript was of value, and worthy of translation for the Society.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Manuscript be forwarded to Mr. de Vos, and that he be asked to prepare a Paper from it, and to submit it to the Council for consideration; on the understanding that the Paper do contain additional matter to that already published regarding Ceylon elephants.\n\n12. Resolved,\u2014That the matter of fixing a date and business of the next General Meeting do stand over for decision at the next Council Meeting.\n\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, May 18, 1898.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, in the Chair.\nMr. Staniforth Green, Vice-President.\nMr. J.

Colombo, February 27, 1898.\n\nSIR,\u2014At the Annual General Meeting of the Society held on the 26th instant, under the presidency of the Hon. Mr. Justice Lawrie, Vice-President, it was unanimously resolved to direct the attention of the Government to that portion of the Annual Report referring to inadequate accommodation for the Library.\n\n2.

Pole, who was formerly stationed in that district. I accordingly despatched a native collector to the jungles of Udagama to try to secure further specimens for the purpose of comparison. He\nreturned with several full-grown examples (alive), also some ova and embryonic shells. Altogether a fairly complete series has been examined.\n\nFor information relating to habitat, &c., I am indebted to Mr. John Pole, in whose honour this species has been named.\n\n*Acavus (poleii)* strongly recalls *A. waltoni* (Reeve), to which it is closely allied. It is readily distinguished however by its somewhat narrower and more solid shell, its much paler colour, and especially by its pure white peristome. The last feature is as constant as the very dark brown or black peristome of *A. waltoni*, the species which abounds in our hill districts.\n\nThe animals of the two species present marked differences in colouration and appearance, as follows:\n\n*Acavus (poleii).*\u2014Animal mouse-colour; head and tentacles dark brown; foot-sole pale brown, with purple marginal fringe. Egg (largest specimen) 25 mm. long, 16 mm. broad.\n\n*Acavus waltoni.*\u2014Animal dark inky-blue; tentacles deep bluish-gray; foot-sole dirty white, with fringe of pale indigo. Egg (largest specimen) 22 mm. long, 13 mm. broad.\n\nDistribution.\u2014*Acavus (poleii)* appears to be restricted to the forests of the Southern Province, where neither of the other allied species of the genus are known to occur.\n\nThe distribution of the recorded species of *Oligospira* appear to be as follows:\n\n*Acavus (Oligospira) skinneri* (Reeve).\u2014Pattipola, Province of Uva, 5,000 ft. (Haly).\n\n*Acavus (\u2014) waltoni* (Reeve).\u2014Common throughout the Central Province, 2,000\u20134,000 ft.\n\n*Acavus (\u2014) (poleii, n. sp).*\u2014Udagama, Southern Province, 500 ft. (Pole).\n\n6. The following Paper was then read by its author:\n\n---\n\n* In 1894 Jousseaume proposed to separate the flattened species from the more turbinate forms of *Acavus* by the creation of a subgenus *Acavella*. (M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Zoologique de France, 1894, p. 288.) But Ancey had already introduced *Oligospira* in the Conchologists' Exchange (II., p. 22, 1887), and as the latter term has been accepted by Pilsbry (Manual of Conchology, Series II., Vol. VI., p. 82) it has been adopted here.\nAIDS TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF CEYLON BIRDS.\n\nPart I.\u2014Introduction and Key to the Passeres.\n\nBy A. HALY, Director of the Colombo Museum.\n\n[Note.\u2014The titles of the following works are abbreviated thus:\u2014\n\nLegge.\u2014Legge, W.V.: A History of the Birds of Ceylon, 2 vols., London, 1880.\n\nCatalogue.\u2014Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum, by various Authors, 1874 to 1894.\n\nFauna.\u2014Fauna of British India, Oates and Blanford, 4 vols., 1889 to 1898.\n\nDictionary.\u2014A Dictionary of Birds, by Newton, Gadow, and others, 1896.\u2014A. H.]\n\nThe following list of Birds recorded from Ceylon is compiled from the \"Fauna of British India, Birds.\"\n\nMy first object has been to make the identification of our Ceylon birds as easy as possible for the student.\n\nNo one needs to be told that he has an eagle or an owl, a parrot or a pigeon, before him. If he wishes, however, to define the genera or sub-families or families under which his specimen is classed, he will find himself plunged in difficulties, which it is partly the object of the following pages to point out.\n\nAs a matter of fact I believe that in a limited Fauna like our own, the measurements and colours will be found sufficient for the identification of any of the species.\n\nThe names of the species are those of the Fauna. After the name one or more figures are inserted in brackets, which refer to the paragraphs of the key which precedes each order.\n\nThese keys are compiled from the Fauna, and are so arranged that the characters of any species can be read continuously from the more to the less general. By means of two extra columns of figures the paragraphs can be referred\nto both backwards and forwards; thus, if the bird before the student has less than ten tail feathers the number opposite that character (293) will guide him to nine feathers without reading all the key between. In the same way, opposite nine feathers in the tail is a number (4) which carries back the reader to ten feathers.\n\nOnly those parts of the keys in the Fauna have been selected that more immediately define and contrast Ceylon species, otherwise it would have been greatly extended.\n\nTwo references follow the name, one to Legge the next to the British Museum Catalogue. Legge's English name is given as the one probably the most convenient for Ceylon students. Then follows the geographical distribution, next the local, both condensed as much as possible.\n\nAs regards the descriptions, I have been careful to compare all the species represented in the Museum collection with the Fauna, and have endeavoured to bring out all the salient points in the clearest manner. Full descriptions of the colours of the plumage are often of great length, and in many cases, as in the larks and the pipits, almost useless.\n\nMy second object has been to give more information about the geographical distribution of the allied species than is given either by Legge or the Fauna. Thus, under each genus, I have referred to the British Museum Catalogue and under the families to Wallace's Geographical Distribution.\n\nI have carefully avoided all allusions to the habits of the birds or to their nidification and other matters of that sort. If the serious study of our birds is to be entered upon the Fauna must be procured, and should be supplemented by Legge.\n\nThirdly, I have taken the opportunity to call attention to the historical side of the subject. This of course has been mainly taken from the Dictionary.\n\nUnder the higher divisions will be found additional remarks on the distribution, and as a rule other characters than those in the key, with the opinions of a few of the principal authorities on their value.\nClass Aves.\u2014Birds, whether living or extinct, stand out sharply defined from the rest of the animal kingdom by the possession of feathers. They are descended from some group of reptiles to which in many respects they are closely allied. So far, the leading authorities seem to be agreed. Another point that seems at present tolerably certain, is that the extinct Archaeopteryx with its toothed jaws and long bony tail forms a group by itself. According to Huxley, 1867, this bird constituted an order, to which two others were to be added, the birds with a keeless breast bone and those with a keeled.\n\nThus we get three orders: the Saurur\u00e6 represented by the Archaeopteryx, the Ratit\u00e6 by the Ostriches and their allies, and the Carinate\u00e6, which include all our other existing birds.\n\nIn 1880 Professor Marsh published the results of his famous discoveries in fossil birds, and gave it as his opinion that the Ratit\u00e6 are survivors of the original stem which branched off from the Reptilian type.\n\nIn 1888 Professor Feurbringer proposed two sub-classes: the first Saurur\u00e6 containing the Archaeopteryx, the second Ornithur\u00e6 all other birds, the Ratit\u00e6 being regarded as descendants of Carinate birds that have lost their powers of flight.\n\nMr. Oates in the Fauna will have nothing to do with the Carinate\u00e6, and divides existing birds simply into orders.\n\nWe are here confronted with fundamental differences of opinion so profound that all the student can do is to wait further developments.\n\nOrder I.: Passeres.\u2014This order contains as many species as all the rest of the class put together. According to Professor Feurbringer they are a group of Cretaceous age which arose in the Oriental region, where the least modified forms, the Euryl\u00e6mid\u00e6, still exist. He considers them equivalent to a family with four sub-families.\n\nThe definition of the order, as will be seen by the key, is purely anatomical; but if we include the Euryl\u00e6mi, which are very closely allied, the following external\ncharacters may be considered diagnostic. The hallux forms a separably movable hind toe, and the greater wing coverts are in a single row not extending beyond the secondaries. The hind claw is the largest, and Sir Richard Owen gave as a character of his Insessores \"the two external toes united at the base.\"\n\nORDER I.\u2014PASSERES.\n\nThe deep plantar tendons passerine; palate \u00e6githognathous.\n\n1 ...

DUTCH EAST INDIA CO., compiled and published, according to the knowledge which can be derived in respect thereof, not only from one's daily experience, but from other clear proof presented to us, and from our own observations, by Cornelis Taay van Wezel,\u00b9 Acting \"Gezaghebber\" of the \"Commandement\" of Galle, also \"Land-drost\" and \"Hoofd\" over the lands of Matara, Ao. 1713.\n\nTranslated from the Dutch by F. H. de Vos, Barrister-at-Law.\n\nNOTWITHSTANDING that the well known Plinius in his time had undertaken a treatise on, and description of, many strange and rare animals found in various lands and parts of the world, and amongst them the elephants found in various regions, yet I being incited to it by a strange fancy will take the trouble to give a fuller account of the aforesaid great beasts, and publish the same for the delectation of those curious in these matters, seeing that I, by a close investigation into, and experience of, these matters, have remarked and found that the aforesaid author has made some mistakes, as will be seen on a comparison of these pages with the description of the aforesaid Plinius. But in order not to delay the reader by a reference to those points on which Plinius and I differ, I shall proceed to treat of what has\ncome within my observation by remarking, in the first place, that it is sufficiently acknowledged and known to all the world that the elephants are the largest quadrupeds known to man, being by some held to be the largest of all animals. But if there be any hesitation to accept this as true however, although in point of artfulness and natural cunning the elephants do not come up to other wild beasts, such as foxes, monkeys, &c., yet that the elephants are exceedingly docile are found by many living and clear proofs, for they are used by many Indian potentates and princes, not only for purposes of ceremonial and show, but also in war, to injure the enemy by means of heavy long iron chains, which they swing about so lustily with their trunks that many are knocked down and killed thereby.\n\nElephants are also kept and used in the courts of many Indian kings and princes only to show their power and majesty to foreigners and their own subjects; for they seem to place and set in this a special honour and glory, the elephants being, in the Court of the Emperor of Ceylon or King of Kandy, on the arrival or departure of any ambassadors, drawn up in a double circle, as is customary in the army before princes and exalted personages, without in any way seeking by this comparison to show any similarity the one to the other.\n\nThese elephants in Kandy were not only kept and used for show and honour, but also as executioners, to put to death criminals, for those guilty of treason or other serious, nay even trivial, offences were thrown before the elephants, who in no time tear and crush these unfortunate men with their tusks and feet, and sometimes seizing them in the middle with their trunks they throw them up perpendicularly, catch them with their tusks, and then kill them\u2014a fearful and horrible sight, fit to deter all onlookers from all evil designs. These aforesaid elephants are specially taught and instructed in this, being quick and dexterous in this business of carrying out the wishes and orders of their masters.\nIn addition to this, the elephants were taught various tricks for the amusement of those who take pleasure therein, viz., the raising of the trunk, kneeling on their forelegs to all appearance of reverence, the parrying of blows with the trunk and feet, and various other drolleries, which I shall not mention here; and I begin now to duly carry out my undertaking and give a clear and concise account of the subject of this Paper.\n\nThe coitus and propagation of these large animals take place in the same way as other beasts, without any difference, January and February being the ordinary seasons when they become \"must,\" and they are seldom seen to come together outside these months, although it sometimes happens.\n\nWhen the elephants are with young they only get in milk about the seventh month, and then their dugs drop a bit and begin to increase in size; and they begin to procreate when they are fifteen to sixteen years old, not earlier, but, if anything, later, when they are fully developed, never getting more than one young at a time; but how often an elephant drops its young cannot be stated with any certainty.\n\nIt is indeed wonderful and hardly credible what little milk elephants that have given birth to young give. For although one would think that such great beasts would, as compared with other animals, give a large quantity of milk to rear their young, yet it is found that they scarcely give out more than a canful at a time. It cannot therefore be conceived how such beasts can be kept up and nourished with such little nutriment. But it should be considered that the milk of the elephant is very fatty and potent, excelling in this respect that of all other known animals, as has been found by experience, for otherwise the young could not live and would necessarily die of hunger and thirst, it being affirmed by many Sinhalese as the truth that an elephant just born becomes quite strong and active in three days on a little elephant's milk and honey given to it\nof a morning. But this should be looked upon as a mere story. But it is well known and certain that the kings of Kandy have been in the habit from a long time, when they wish to blind any criminals, to tie a piece of cloth soaked in sulphur and elephant's milk round their eyes, when they become incurably blinded in less than half or three-quarters of an hour. It ought also to be remarked that the elephant's milk is not quite white, but blueish, the young taking suck about three or four times a day, but very little at a time, without being at the dugs very long. It is also found that the tusked young remain some months longer at the dugs than the alias and she-elephants, who generally cease to suck about the fifth year.\n\nAn elephant's period of gestation\\(^4\\) is fully a year or twelve months, after which it is delivered of its young in a manner which sufficiently indicates to man the wonderful prescience with which Nature has endowed these wild beasts. For the mother, feeling that the time has arrived to be delivered of its young, goes down on her hind legs in order to shorten the fall and obviate danger of injury, and doing her best to give birth to her young; and as soon as the young is born, it begins stroking it gently and softly with the trunk and bringing it to the dugs, it being necessary to note here that the udders of an elephant are not like other animals, behind, but have been placed by Nature between or close to the fore legs.\n\nWhen an elephant brings forth before the appointed time the young is covered with a sort of net or membrane, which the mother (to the amazement of man) knows how to gently and softly remove with its trunk without causing any pain or hurt to the young, in which case the young beasts sometimes die, but, on the other hand, sometimes live and grow.\n\nA young elephant when born is found to be generally about \\(1\\frac{7}{8}\\) cobidos\\(^5\\) (\\(2\\frac{3}{4}\\) Rhenish feet) high and \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) to \\(2\\frac{5}{8}\\) cobidos long, furnished with tolerably long hair over the entire body. But after some time the said hair falls off, except at the end\nof the tail, where a tuft remains, serving as a special sign of beauty, by which the Indians and lovers of elephants set great store. But how many inches an elephant grows a year cannot be exactly stated, nor can any certain information be derived regarding this matter. But I must here state that I have seen that the beasts who have been in the stalls for 3, 4, yea 8, 10, to 12 months, have grown 1, 2, 4, 7, yea 10 and 11 inches, i.e., young and not fully developed beasts; but seeing that this growth is not the same in all cases, nothing can be stated with certainty in respect thereof.\n\nWhen a she-elephant with calf dies before the latter is able to eat leaves or other hard food, it is kept up and nourished with *cansje*, being watery cooked rice with some jaggery balls or black sugar, by which sometimes the lives of these little beasts are spared, and afterwards they are put to other food, although in most cases (if they are quite too young) they languish and die.\n\nFurther, it seems strange to note the evident sorrow and grief which cow-elephants manifest on the death of their young, and it is often noticed and remarked that they (so to speak) weep bitterly and shed tears, stroking the dead body with their trunks, without taking any food till they themselves die, or have quite forgotten their young.\n\nThe elephants like all other animals are subject to various diseases, maladies, and ills, for which all necessary remedies for their recovery are resorted to by the doctors, as purgatives, syringing, bleeding, lancing of abscesses, appostumation (cupping?), and otherwise. And the ulceration or wounds (which are sometimes caused by binding fast ropes to the four feet and neck and otherwise) are cured by large tufts made of cocoanut husk or rags soaked in a sort of lotion or oil (according to the nature of the accident), being bound various times a day. And wicks of cloth are inserted into the wound; and it cannot be omitted to be stated here that most of these medicines are generally made in various ways, of green and dried drugs, roots, and shrubs, found in Ceylon in the jungles\nor thickly-grown woods and adjoining fields. And it remains to be considered here that when elephants have a film or any other trouble in the eye and cannot be treated in consequence of their fury and rage, a sort of syringe is used to squirt the medicine into the eyes and thus to bring about their recovery.\n\nIf an elephant is bitten and injured by a venomous snake without its being noticed, we can know it by the looseness of the hair, which then begins to fall and come off, in which case the wedderala or physician is brought into requisition, and he at once applies the necessary remedies to cure the said beast, and recovery generally takes place if the remedies are ready at hand and applied at once, otherwise such elephants run a risk and generally die.\n\nAfter close investigation and much experience it has been ascertained that the elephant (except in the case of death by accident) can live from 100 to 110, sometimes even to 120 years, when they languish and die of nothing but old age. It is also necessary to point out in this place that if an elephant is down with any malady or accident, it seldom rises again, but generally remains lying thus till it dies, so that all hopes are given up when elephants are reduced to this condition.\n\nThe elephants found in various parts of India are of various castes or kinds, which have the following names, viz., Panderye, Tambelye, Pingelye, Gandeye, Mangelye, Hemeye, Oepasatye, Satdantye, Calewockeye, and Gangeye; but of these we have in Ceylon the first four castes, which are stronger and more spirited than the last two, and weaker than the other four kinds. But as regards the propagation of the species, there is no difference between the castes, and nothing further need be said on this point.\n\nThe largest elephants caught and tamed in Ceylon are from 9 to $9\\frac{1}{2}$ Rhenish feet; for although larger elephants are found in the forests of other countries, those of Ceylon are better taken care of and esteemed, being generally more docile and quicker at learning things than those from\nAatchin, Siam, Tamasserye, and Aracean or other regions, so that the merchants who yearly negotiate with the East India Company for elephants pay a large sum for those from Ceylon, as will be shown at length hereafter.\n\nElephants are often \"baptized\" with the name of holbuiken (lit. hollow stomachs, i.e., gluttons), and this for good reason, as they must continually eat by night and day, except during the short intervals of sleep, without their hunger being in any way appeased, having a great heat and boiling in the stomach, by reason whereof what they eat is in a short time, and sometimes in less than a quarter of an hour, sufficiently digested and passed in the usual way.\n\nAnd in order that one should not doubt the truth of this, it should be stated here that it has often been observed that when they have swallowed whole, without breaking them, a certain kind of round fruit called bolanges and slime apples, it is known in Ceylon that the shells of the fruits (little less than the little finger in thickness) are found to have been passed quite empty without any kernel in them, the same being digested in a short time, notwithstanding that the shell being so hard one would have thought it impossible that what was contained in it should be absorbed in so short a time.\n\nWhen the elephants are in the stables they are fed on pisang trees (arecanut), branches of the clappus (cocoanut) trees, and all sorts of grass. But in the jungle they eat besides nely (paddy) and other fine grain, also various kinds of branches and leaves called in the Sinhalese language panakolle, kaylewel, patnoege, oeggas, mandoewel, annekas-kolle, and other kinds too numerous to enumerate here, and of little avail to satisfy the curiosity of the reader. Therefore I shall touch on other points, and say that as the elephants have to be continually eating to satisfy their hunger, so it is no wonder that they drink a large quantity of water in proportion to the food which they consume in such quantity; and I have seen with my own eyes an elephant drink fifty cans of water at a time. It remains also\nto be remarked here that wild elephants in the jungle drink water twice a day, viz., in the morning and evening, going for that purpose to certain rivers, streams, and other watering places. But in the stalls they are not allowed to drink more than once a day, that is, when they are brought to the river and washed, when they swell themselves as much as Nature will let them, without being in any way hindered thereby.\n\nAs regards the period during which elephants can go without food or drink, it may be stated, for the satisfaction of those who are fond of the elephant, that these elephants have been found by experience to go without water at most for three days, and can remain longer without food, but by remaining long without food or drink they languish and die of weakness, which, regarding their hungry and thirsty nature, which is great, is not to be wondered at.\n\nAnd as all living creatures have their times of sleep and wakefulness, so elephants, like many other quadrupeds, sleep stretched out, but not longer than an hour or hour and a half in the evening, when they rise again and refresh themselves with eating, and afterwards go to sleep again about morning, but not for more than an hour at most, so that these beasts generally sleep from two and a half to three hours a day, sometimes also resting during the day, but seldom, and never longer than half an hour, sometimes less if they are not very hungry or otherwise, for they seem to prefer eating to sleeping.\n\nThese elephants have also great power in the tooth, and are strong in carrying loads, for they have been seen to crack with their teeth a hard cocoanut in pieces as if it were a hazelnut. And they bear on their shoulders a burden of 1,200 pounds weight and go about with ease. And the noise and cry of these elephants is so great and piercing that the earth seems to tremble in consequence, and when heard at night of a sudden is enough to frighten the boldest man, especially when their cry is followed by an echo in the dark jungle. But it is wonderful what small eyes they\nhave in proportion to their bodies, for they are not larger than the eyes of an ordinary horse, from which one would conclude that they are not so sharp-sighted as other beasts in seeing things at a distance. And as regards their pace, I shall state here that, although they are bulky and heavy beasts, they have been found to go eight to nine miles in a day, although such journeys have to be undertaken in the morning and evening, when the heat of the sun can hinder them least, for otherwise they would run the risk of being overcome by the great heat of the sun.\\textsuperscript{13} Therefore, when such beasts are taken from one place to another care should be taken to note this, in order to avoid all inconvenience.\n\nIt is remarkable also that these elephants are more quick at turning round towards the right than the left, so that those who are pursued by these animals in the jungle should take the opportunity of turning to the left to avoid danger and get out of the scrape.\n\nAnd although one would think that elephants in consequence of their heavy bodies would find difficulty in saving themselves from drowning in deep water, the contrary is the case.\\textsuperscript{14} But our observation tells us that when these beasts are in a healthy state they can swim a quarter of a mile in a strange and wonderful manner.\\textsuperscript{15} For, generally, there is seen only a part of the trunk through which they breathe and blow out the water, but sometimes the head is above and the body hidden, and it cannot be said for certainty whether they take in any water whilst swimming.\n\nAnd although an elephant is very strong and able to do much injury, yet it is not savage by nature like many other wild beasts, which can never or seldom be tamed or governed, and always preserve their natural instincts. But elephants, on the contrary (although caught full-grown), are so tractable and obedient in a short time that they can be quietly and easily led and managed as one likes, yea, it has been found that these great beasts are so frightened and tremble at hard words of abuse that they appear to wish it understood that they are not used to them. And although\nmany ignorant people will scarcely believe this, I, who have seen this with my own eyes, can testify to it.\\textsuperscript{16}\n\nBut I must not forget to mention here that elephants during the breeding season become quite wild and violent, and great care should be taken of them during this period, by having them tethered with strong ropes or iron chains to strong trees or posts till their fury and natural impulses cool down, in order to prevent many sad accidents which might, and often do, arise therefrom if they are not secured in time, or before one begins to know that they are not to be trusted. This change in them can be discovered by an oily secretion in the hollows next to or above the eyes, which lasts so long as the desire to mate lasts.\\textsuperscript{17} But after a certain time this ceases, and they are again tame and tractable as they were before they became \"must.\" It is wonderful to notice the honour and respect paid by the \\textit{alias} and cow-elephants to the tuskers, so much so that they gladly allow the little tuskers to take suck from them, although they belong to other mothers, but why there should be this preference is not permissible to be explained here.\n\nIn Ceylon there are found few elephants with large and long tusks, with which the cows are never furnished, and most bulls have no other teeth than those in their mouth for necessary use, and these are \"baptized\" by the Sinhalese and Company's officers \"\\textit{alias},\"\\textsuperscript{18} to distinguish them from those which are, as said before, furnished with tusks.\n\nThe heaviest elephant tusks found in Ceylon within the memory of man have been found to be each about 75 to 80 pounds in weight, which is not much compared with the weight of those found in Africa, America, and other parts of the world; for these are often bigger, thicker, and heavier than those in Ceylon. But as to the use to which tusks are put I shall make no mention of it here, seeing that it is well known and is outside the scope of this Paper. But as a matter of special observation I shall state here the requisite qualities of the full-grown elephant caught for the service and pleasure of the Emperor of Ceylon and King of\nKandy, and also those most suitable to the trade of the Hon. Company. The first kind aforesaid, most difficult to get and hence most prized, must have snow-white eyes, the apples of which are of a yellowish colour, the forehead spotted white, and two outstretched tusks of even length, the right being a little longer than the left, the trunk and tail reaching the ground, eighteen\\textsuperscript{19} white and clear nails in the four feet, viz., five and four on each forefoot and hindfoot respectively, the back running like that of a wild pig, and the ear whole. This is sufficient in the eyes of the king. But the elephants caught for the trade of the Company need only have their ears untorn, hair in the tail, and as many nails on each foot as stated above, without regard to the colour of the nails or eyes. On the other hand, all animals which are quite old, with ears damaged and with stumpy tails, and which have seventeen or less nails, are considered worthless, as being unfit for trade, and merchants at once turn away their faces from them, or offer very low prices for them.\n\nWe have sufficiently touched on the character of the elephant and how they breed, and shall now proceed to discuss the elephant hunt and the coraal or snare by which these animals are caught in parts of M\u00e1tara.\n\nThe coraal\\textsuperscript{20} or trap (which the accompanying sketch indicates as a flat plot of ground)* has two wings, No. 1 called Rewoelwette in Sinhalese, and three divisions with names, Welgalle No. 2, Kelinagaale No. 3, and Hirregaale No. 4. The first division, wherein the two wings (No. 1) are fixed, is generally and sometimes more than 500 roods in circumference or less, according as the master of the hunt finds the place suitable and the elephants hunted are great in number, and the second coraal is half as large, but the last (No. 4) is only 8 ft. broad and 4 to 6 roods long, and there are four drop-gates (No. 5) at the enclosure, which stand between the two wings, also one drop-gate between the first and the second division (Nos. 2 and 3), together with one more\n\n* Not reproduced.\u2014Hon. Sec.\nbetween the second and last division (Nos. 3 and 4). The enclosure round the coraal, or which constitutes the coraal proper, is made of heavy trees and posts tolerably close to each other, being 16 ft. to 18 ft. high and 3 to 4 ft. thick. These posts are driven about three-quarters of a fathom into the ground, and have generally four, five, or six cross-beams about 2 ft. above each other strongly bound with jungle creepers, and outside this coraal there is at a distance of each rood a support which lies diagonally across the enclosure to resist the rush of the elephants.\n\nWhen the season arrives to organize the hunt, people (specially used for this purpose called Waggekarreas or spies) are sent to the jungles to find out where most of the elephants are to be found, which is done with necessary silence, and when they have made their report, preparations are begun for the hunt. But before I proceed to describe such hunt, I must here state shortly that the elephants are generally found in herds of from five, ten, to fifteen and twelve or more in the jungles, and it is seldom that they are found one or two alone, unless they are ill-tempered beasts known by the name of ronkedoors or mischief-makers (lit. snorters), who graze alone and separate from the herd.\n\nIf a herd of elephants is separated from the rest in the jungle, one should set to work in order to enclose them all as it were in a pentagon, as appears clearly from the hereto annexed plan. The elephants being thus surrounded, all the herds are now driven to the middle of the appointed place, where they eventually meet, when the part of the place marked A and B is broken up and is brought to the two furthest ends of the wings C D, to make the elephants enter the coraal or snare.\n\nWhen the elephants are thus driven within the wings they should be pursued with great uproar and beating of tambilntyes, or native drums, with the discharge of guns, with weapons, the burning of torches, and carrying of burning pots on the head, and then from one end of the wing to the other, viz., along the line F F, great trees and jungle are\ncut to a great distance to prevent the animals from breaking through and escaping.\n\nThe elephants being now enclosed within the two wings C D, are driven into the first (No. 1), and afterwards into the maal coraal (No. 2), and from the maal coraal into the trave (No. 3), the furthest end of which is, in such a case, strengthened with cross-beams and well secured to prevent escape, each beast that comes in here being at once secured by strong cross-beams from behind the body, so that it can go neither backward nor forward, and when four to five are caught they are brought out one by one.\n\nBut as I shall have to say something about this hunt at the end of this Paper, I should state here that the same requires great trouble and practice, and is well worth seeing to one who is fond of such things, notwithstanding the discomforts and dangers often attendant thereon, for it is wonderful how men play with these strong and wild beasts without showing any fear, although sometimes accidents do occur and many people are killed, but every possible precaution is taken against such accidents.\n\nThe elephants who are thus imprisoned in the trave and secured by cross-beams are closely examined, and should any great defects be observed in them which cannot be easily remedied, these beasts are allowed to escape into the woods, for otherwise they would have to be kept without being used for many years, and fed to the great expense of the natives.\n\nAnd now to show how elephants are caught in the dominion of the King of Kandy, it must be stated at first that those who go to the forest for that purpose (consisting generally of from fifteen to twenty persons), when they meet a fine and fit beast, hide behind a great tree until they can get an opportunity to put a noose round one of its hind feet, which being done they keep it always fast bound to a tree when the beast begins to move, so that the beast finding much hindrance finally gets tired and worn out without being able to make much resistance, after which the said\nelephant is tied to two hunting elephants and brought to the stalls and tamed. These nooses are made of strips of deer hide, which being twisted when damp and soft are found to become afterwards very strong and almost unbreakable. But in ancient times even in the Company's dominion there was another way of catching elephants, viz., by pits expressly dug for the purpose and carefully covered with thin sticks, leaves, and sand, in consequence of which the elephants cannot be aware of these pits when they are quietly driven to them until they fall into them. They are left there some days until they are reduced to submission, through hunger and thirst, after which they are taken out of the pits and brought to the stalls. But as many beasts died in consequence of the heavy fall into the pits, this way of catching elephants was disapproved, and as a consequence has been given up these many years.\n\nTo take an elephant out of the trave one must first tie to each side of his neck a hunting elephant with five to six strong ropes, so that the ropes reach the extreme limits of the aforesaid stall, and thereafter the cross-beams at the end of the stall are drawn out and, as before, a rope is tied to each hind leg of the beast, which ropes are fastened to two high posts with three or four coils. The beast is then drawn out by veering out the rear ropes gradually, the two ropes behind slackened from outside, at the same time tying the beast close to the hunting elephant. And after it is brought to the stall, where there are two supports so far apart from each other that an elephant can easily put his head between them, and also a cross-beam which hangs close to the aforesaid supports, about two cobidos or less from the ground.\n\nAfter an elephant has with the help of the hunting elephant been thus brought into the stall, and afterwards behind the aforesaid supports, he is allured with grass and other leaves so far forwards that he comes to put his neck between the aforesaid two posts. The cross-beam is then drawn up to touch the lower part of the neck, and at the\nsame time two ropes are attached to each support under the cross-beam, and the neck thus secured that the coil goes over the same under the cross-beam and round the supports, after which the neck is tied in the same way with two windings of rope, the end thereof being between the two supports drawn up and made secure to a beam. The two fore feet have each to be tied fast with a rope to the afore-said supports, and there is yet another rope so close to this that it is about a hand's breadth from the others. The two hind feet are also first tied together in the same manner with two ropes, and to each of them are attached two other ropes, the ends of which are tied to two ropes standing on each side.\n\nAn elephant thus stalled is kept awake night and day, and always fed on grass and other food, and also untied once a day and brought to the water with the hunting elephants, not only to be refreshed and watered, but also to be washed and cleansed, they being taught in the meantime, on being shown the hook, to lie on the ground on their paunch, and to raise their feet, and carry a man on their back. The cuts caused to the neck and feet by the ropes are treated to lotions and liniments as stated before. But if they have any internal disease, remedies are prepared against this in the hollowed piece of an arecanut tree and thus administered, and in other ways according to circumstances. When an elephant has become tolerably tame and docile, he is stalled as follows: Having loosened all the aforesaid ropes and removed the cross-beam and the two supports, the fore right foot and hind left foot, or vice versa, are each tied with two or three ropes to a post 3 or 4 ft. distant, so that the beast stands in the middle of the stall without moving to the right or left.\n\nHaving often spoken before of the hunting elephants used for bringing the newly-captured elephants out of the coraal into the stall and daily to water, it remains to be informed the inexperienced reader that these hunting elephants are made up of all kinds of defective and unsaleable elephants,\ntuskers, alias, and cows, who after a length of time have become quite tame and have been properly taught how to treat their comrades between them and induce them to do their duty, for which reason these hunting elephants have from a long time been called zielverkoopers\\(^{22}\\) (soul sellers) by the Company's servants; but if tuskers are used for this purpose, the tusks are sawn off close to the snout and kept sawn yearly, in order to prevent them from digging into the wild beasts and injuring them.\n\nThe means or instruments which the cornax\\(^{23}\\) or riders use to guide and regulate the aforesaid beasts consists only of two iron hooks, provided with points, and long sticks or wooden handles, of which the elephant is much afraid, not being able to endure the pricking or the tickling and thumping under the jaw bones, so that they in such cases utter a loud cry.\n\nThe servient people and servants of the Hon. Company used in the elephant hunt are of various castes, viz., Lascoryns, Baddanas, Welkareas, Wagekareas, and villagers; but of these, only the three first-named get maintenance or support on paddy or rice, and the villagers on the contrary get no compensation or reward and are bound to help in the hunt, the elephant hunt costing only in paddy or rice for the support of the labourers, generally amounting to 300 parras or 4 lasts. Therefore, the Hon. Company need only incur very little expense, except providing a quantity of cayer rope to tie the elephants with, which is not of much account.\n\nFor further understanding the subject, it is necessary to state here what kinds of servants and people are employed in catching and stalling the elephants, and to add a short account of their duties according to the services which they are bound to perform from their birth, viz.:\n\nEtbandene Vidane is called the master of the hunt.\nGaysenaike, first chief of the elephant stalls, with his dependants.\nWederale, physician of the elephant.\nAraatse, overseer of the elephant stalls in the absence of the Gaysenaike.\n\nAatjes were also used as overseers to see that everything was all right.\n\nBaddanas tie the trave and drive the elephants from the bushes into the coraal. They have also to confine the animals in the trave with ropes.\n\nWelkareas must cut creepers and deliver them for tying the coraals.\n\nWagekareas, spies who go about the jungle, count the elephant herds, disclose matters of importance: how many beasts are found in each herd, and where they really are.\n\nPannikeas are minor chiefs with some cornax under them.\n\nCornax are overseers and riders of elephants.\n\nDourias and Tanterias are used to tie the wild elephants and also to control the hunting elephants.\n\nPanneas have to bring grass and cocoanut leaves and provide all other food.\n\nOlias are used for the preparation and application of medicines for the elephants suffering with internal complaints or external injuries.\n\nSo it can be seen what different kinds of people are necessary to be maintained for the service of the elephant, so that I shall not further speak on this point.\n\nMost of the elephants which come into the hands of the Company are sold in Jaffnapatnam, in consequence of the good prices current there, established by the chief Government for the information of its servants, for which purpose the merchants of Golconda and other leading merchants on the Coromandel Coast pay their money into the Company's treasury there and remit by bill to Jaffnapatnam to be paid in elephants. The valuation of these great beasts is accurately regulated, and their height, figure, and fine points are carefully noted, as their prices vary a great deal, for the slightest defects cause a diminution in the price, as the merchants are very hard to please. But the tuskers are generally very dear, and are sometimes sold for 2,800\nrixdollars of 48 Dutch stuivers each, or for more of course if they are good big beasts without any faults or natural defects. But on the other hand, the small toothless elephants are valued at 100 to 200 or 300 rixdollars each, which price gradually increases to 3,000 rixdollars, according to the quality of the beast as stated before. But at all events the bull-elephants are more prized than the cows, as the Hon. Company yearly makes considerable profit by the sale of elephants in Ceylon, and the more so, as the expenses of catching them are not heavy, seeing that the huntsmen and others employed in the hunt have to be satisfied only with the food they get, without any claim for the least recompense for their services, seeing that they have been conquered by the sword and are enslaved to the lord of the land, as has been before stated when the expenses of the hunt were referred to.\n\nWhen any elephants have been selected and finally bought by the merchants they are branded with hot irons on the rump with a mark, in order that they may not be fraudulently sold again, and to prevent disputes among the merchants, for each knows the marks with which his elephants have been branded. Some merchants are, however, in the habit of hanging boards with marks thereon on the necks of the elephants bought by them, and thus avoid the branding. But as such boards are easily removed and difficulties arise therefrom, this method is seldom followed, and branding as aforesaid is adopted for greater security.\n\nWhen the merchants have thus bought the aforesaid elephants from the Hon. Company, and have no occasion to send the same at once to the Coromandel Coast, either for lack of boats or otherwise, the beasts remain at their own risk in the stalls till they are removed. In such cases the Hon. Company suffers no loss, but in some cases a helping hand is in justice given to these merchants.\n\nAnd as I have spoken of cobidos in various places, so it is necessary, in order to a better understanding, to say that a\ncobido is a lineal measure of 16 Dutch inches or $1\\frac{1}{3}$ Rhenish feet, by which the elephants are measured to the first hump on the neck right over the forefeet. But to prevent all disputes and cause a proper measurement to be taken, a long pole of from seven to eight cobidos is used. It is made to stand perpendicularly on level ground by the side of the elephant, and another is placed horizontally on the hump, so that thereby the proper height is ascertained and the price regulated accordingly without prejudice either to vendor or vendee.\n\nBesides the aforesaid, there is much to be said about the elephants, but as this Paper has already become longer than I expected I shall pass by the rest, and conclude this account with the hope that the reader will be satisfied with what I have written.\n\n4. The Chairman read the following\u2014\n\nNOTES.\n\nBy F. H. Modder.\n\n1 Cornelis Taay van Wezel was Commandeur of Galle (circa 1714\u201319). He was married to Johanna van Rhee, who was born at Negapatam on May 19, 1668, and died July 15, 1719.

XI., p. 375, where Saar relates how Cornelis Salvegad, of Utrecht, standard-bearer, was ordered by the King of Kandy to be slain by the elephants for assaulting his captain. The Dutch edition, 1671, Amsterdam, contains at p. 46 an illustration of this incident.\n\nKnox, in describing the execution of criminals by the state elephants of the former Kings of Kandy, says \u201cthey will run their teeth (tusks) through the body, and then tear it in pieces and throw it limb from limb.\u201d He gives a pictorial illustration of this mode of execution. But Tennent, on the authority of the Kandyan chiefs whom he consulted on the subject, did not think that the tusks were designed to be employed offensively. The trunk and feet were used as weapons of offence. (The Wild Elephant, pp. 16, 17.)\n\n3 Wolf's, in his Reizen naar Ceylon, p. 118, relates some; e.g., throwing up a ball and catching it; undoing a parcel tied up with a handkerchief.\n\n4 The period of gestation is 629 days.\n\n5 Height.\u2014Perhaps a corruption of the Portuguese cubito, a cubit.

According to this calculation the above instances given by Ward would be a low average for Ceylon. Tennent gives a better average. I know of one animal, a well-known decoy of Kurun\u00e9gala, who stood 11 ft. The weight of a baby elephant, when born, is about 213 lbs.\n\n6 Kanje, rice broth; Sinhalese kenda. In *Alewyn and Colle\u2019s* Portuguese-Dutch Dictionary (1714) the word is given as Canja, and defined as an \u201cIndische stufsel of pap van ryst gemaakt,\u201d Indian starch or porridge made of rice.\n\n7 Age.\u2014*Wolfs*, p. 108, knows of one that was in captivity fifty-one years. Fleurens, in *De la Long\u00e9vite Humaine*, pp. 82-89, conjectures that the normal age of the elephant is 150 years. Tennent instances a case of a decoy attached to the elephant establishment at M\u00e1tara, which the records found among the papers left by Col. Robertson (son to the historian of Charles V.), who had a command in Ceylon in 1799, proved to have served under the Dutch during the entire period of their occupation, extending to upwards of 140 years; and it was said to have been found in the stables by the Dutch on the expulsion of the Portuguese in 1656.\n\nBaker says that it is impossible to define exactly the limit of old age, as there can be little doubt that captivity shortens the duration of life to a great degree. As an elephant cannot be fully developed in the perfection of ivory until the age of forty, Baker accepts that age in a wild animal as a starting point in life, and says that the term of existence would be about 150 years. (*Wild Beasts and their Ways*, p. 20.)\n\nCaste.\u2014*Hastisilpa*, a Sinhalese work which treats of the \u201cScience of Elephants,\u201d describes with particularity their distinctive excellences and defects and the castes to which they belong. For \u201cpoints of perfection\u201d of an elephant see Baker\u2019s *Wild Beasts and their Ways*, p. 45.\nSee *Wolfs*, p. 108; Albrecht Herport, in his *Oostindische Reizen* (Dutch ed., 1670); *Cey. Lit. Reg.*, vol. I., p. 383, says the same.\n\n9 See Journ. R.A.S., C.B., vol. XI., No. 39, p. 352. In the *Beknopte Historie*, p. 378, in speaking of certain elephants, it is said that the *voorn\u00e6mde holbuiken* (the aforesaid gluttons) would follow.\n\n10 Woodapple; Sinhalese *dimbul*, or *divul*.\n\n11 Baker says that no less than 600 lb. of fodder is the proper daily allowance for an elephant.\n\n12 Elephants are fed at about an hour before sunset and then taken to drink water before actual night.\n\n13 Few animals suffer more from the sun\u2019s rays than the elephant, whose nature, says Baker, prompts it to seek the deepest shade. The distance which an elephant can travel a day is grossly underestimated. According to Baker, the African elephant is capable of a speed of fifteen miles an hour, which it can keep up for two hundred or three hundred yards, after which it would travel at about ten miles an hour, and actually accomplish the distance within that period. The Asiatic elephant might likewise attain a speed of fifteen miles for perhaps a couple of hundred yards, but it would not travel at a greater pace than eight miles an hour, and it would reduce that pace to six after the first five miles. (*Wild Beasts and their Ways*, p. 2.)\n\n14 The displacement of an elephant\u2019s carcase is less than the weight of water, although it swims so deeply immersed that it would appear to float with difficulty.\n\n15 It is difficult, says Baker, to describe the limit of an elephant\u2019s swimming powers; this must depend upon many circumstances, whether it is following the stream or otherwise, but the animal can remain afloat for several hours without undue fatigue.

The authoress (who was accompanied by her father, to whom she dedicates her book, and was the guest of Governor Robinson), had to leave before the kraal took place. She writes: \"It came off the day after our departure, but was considered a great failure, as only five elephants were kraaled that day instead of thirty. A few more were taken the next day, but the sole excitement appeared to have been the escape of one of the tame elephants from his mahout, who, after rushing about for some time in the crowd, was kraaled with the wild ones.\" (Page 191.)

Wolf\u2019s Life and Adventures, pp. 31\u2013164: a male elephant who quarrels about the females \u201cis beat out of the field and obliged to go without a consort; he becomes furious and mad, killing every living creature, be it man or beast\u2014and\nin this state is called Ronkedor, an object of greater terror to a traveller than a hundred wild ones.\u201d Portuguese Roncador, \u201csnorer.\u201d This is the term given by the Dutch to the \u201crogue\u201d (afgeslagen, deserted and cast away) elephant. See Haafner Reize tevoet door het Eiland Ceilon (2ne druk), xix. and 52; Wolf\u2019s, p. 108.\n\n22 Those who obtained recruits for the service of the Dutch East India Company were also called by this name.\n\n23 Cornax, Sin. Kurunayeka: from kuru, \u201celephant,\u201d and nayaka, \u201cchief.\u201d See also Haafner, p. xiv. See Tennent\u2019s Wild Elephant, p. 122.\n\nMost of the elephant-keepers belong to the Kuruvi class, which is a distinct caste. There are, of course, exceptions. \u201cThe Gajanayaka Nilame\u201d (Elephant chief), as Davy points out, was the first officer of the household department. His duty was to superintend the people who had charge of the royal elephants, of whom a register was kept by a subordinate officer called the \u201cCooroonee (Kuruvi?) l\u00e9kam.\u201d I believe \u201cKuruvi Mudaliy\u00e1r\u201d is a well-known title in the low country. In the south, the title, I have been informed, fell into disuse after the elephant hunts were abolished in that division of the Island. Tennent speaks of the \u201cCooroowe Vidahn,\u201d or \u201cthe head of the stables,\u201d standing in front of the wild elephants holding a long stick with a sharp point.\n\nThe iron hook is called in Sinhalese henduwa or ankusa (according to Haafner, p. xix, ankosj\u0101), which is said to be fashioned after the claw of the fabulous monster Etkandalihiniy\u0101, the greatest enemy of the elephant, who carries off ten of them at a time hooked to his powerful talons. In Oriental poetry it is written that the nose of a pretty woman should be like an ankusa!\n\nKornak.\u2014Mr. A. E. Buultjens kindly furnishes me with the following note:\u2014\u201cThis word is explained in an account of elephants appearing in J. C. Wolf\u2019s Reyze naar Ceylon, s\u2019Gravenhage, 1783, where, at page 112, it is clear that the \u2018Kornak\u2019 was the hunter or driver who sits on the tame elephant with his hook, with which he directs the head of the beast on the way it should go. Kornak = jaager = driver or huntsman.\u201d\n\n24 See Wolf\u2019s, p. 115. See also Memorie (December 3, 1679) of Van Goens to Macare.\n\n5. The Chairman asked if they could ascertain the distance the elephant was said to go in a day. The Paper just read gave the distance as eight or nine miles: it might be a misprint for eighty or ninety.\n\n6.

All this corresponds with the opinion and satisfaction which I have with regard to you, and the zeal and valour with which you serve us. And since the affairs of that Island have taken so different a turn from what was reported to me when I ordered the cessation or suspension of the conquest, it seems quite\n\n* This is Mr. de Vos\u2019s reading. Mr. Fre\u00fcdenberg reads geadverteert.\nright (agreeably with your recommendation and advice) that the same conquest should be proceeded with. And therefore I write to the Viceroy* and order him to promote the same, and to help you so far as circumstances there will allow, and that he will procure the conclusion of it. Wherefore I particularly expect from you the accomplishment of this; and after that I recommend you very earnestly to keep this matter in mind, and take it to your charge, resting assured that in respect to it I shall take the same to my consideration, and reckon as you shall act therein, so as greatly to honour you for it and reward you should you possibly be burdened. And as the Bishop of Cochin, with his authority and presence, will be helpful in the affair of the conquest, by encouraging the soldiers and by persuading them with advancements, which I shall grant over and above their ordinary incomes in the distribution of the lands of that Island, so I write to him that he shall proceed for that purpose to Colombo. And I am urged the more to this step in consideration of the particular friendship and good understanding which I have heard exist between you two. And likewise I order the Viceroy that he shall send to that Island as many Christians from St. Thomas and from other places as he shall be able to get together, besides some married Portuguese with their wives, and some orphan girls who might marry there with the soldiers who serve me there, allotting to them some lands whereby they may help and maintain themselves. And that he shall carry into execution what I have ordered with regard to a fleet of six ships which I desire should be stationed there on the coast of the Island, he will keep there the three ships from Manaar referred to, in order to prevent the natives (who stand beyond our jurisdiction) from commerce and trade in every respect, as this will greatly help and facilitate the accomplishment of the conquest. But the chief confidence which I have, that this will be completed in a short\n\n* See ante, p. 201, note \u2020.\ntime, is in your zeal, courage, and discernment, and you shall advise me very particularly of what is done and what may continue.\n\nWritten at Madrid on the 27th January in the year 1607.

When quite young he went to India, served first as a private soldier with very little assistance from his parents, and by his own merits gradually rose to be Admiral at Malacca in 1585, Governor of the Island of Ceylon in 1594, and twentieth Viceroy of India in 1612. (3)\n\n[1590.] Four years prior to his arrival the Portuguese had sustained a severe defeat at the battle of Balana, about four miles from Kandy. Their General, Pedro Lopez de Souza, and several soldiers, had been slain, and Dona Catharina, the captive princess of the Sinhalese dynasty, taken prisoner by the warlike leader of the Sinhalese army, Don Joan of Austria, who after this victory ascended the throne in 1592 as Wimala Dharma Suriya Adascyn. (2)\n\n[1592.] This king, referred to in the manuscripts and in Bald\u00e6us as Don Jan, married Dona Catharina, expelled the Portuguese from\nthe Kandyan Provinces, and built several forts and castles to guard his kingdom. (2)\n\n[1594.] Despatched by Philip III., King of Spain and Portugal, with orders to re-conquer the kingdom of Kandy, Don Jeronimo de Azevedo arrived in Ceylon in 1594 with the title of General of the Conquest in Ceylon, and accompanied by a large force, including many cavaliers and fidalgoes (nobles) from Goa and other places. After various designs and fruitless attempts to regain Kandy he marched as far as Balana in 1601 and encountered the forces of Wimala Dharma I. Long and fiercely did the battle rage, but at last Don Jeronimo was surrounded with his men and was defeated like the General Lopez. However, he succeeded in keeping his men together in order and in retreating to Colombo. Here he was regarded with great honour in that he had brought most of his men in safety after fighting for five days. (1)\n\n[1602.] After this defeat the Portuguese no longer fought with troops against the King of Kandy, but daily they made their defences with trenches and earthworks. The trenches of the king and of the Portuguese were about a mile, and some about half a mile* from one another. Frequently were sallies made and plans tried by the one to dislodge the other. About eight months after this, on Easter day in 1602, there came over to Colombo Emmanuel Dias, who when a young man had been taken prisoner by the king in the time of General Lopez, and had remained serving in Kandy as a great Mudaliy\u00e1r. He again escaped to Colombo and revealed to Don Jeronimo de Azevedo many designs to murder the King of Kandy. He was very welcome and received great credit. His ears had also been bored in the manner of the Sinhalese. This Emmanuel Dias had planned to carry out a double game. He made an agreement with Don Jeronimo and swore upon a silver cross brought before him that he would go with five other Portuguese, viz., the three captains (Christi\u00e6n Jacomo, Albert Primero, and Jan Pererro\u2020) and two other soldiers, to Kandy and deliver them over to the king to serve him, but that on a favourable opportunity they would murder the king. The promise was made that after Don Jan\u2019s death Emmanuel Dias should, for the performance of his work, come into possession of the whole Island. Thereupon Emmanuel Dias received a large sum of money in order the more easily to bring over the people to his side, and solemn promises were made upon oath a second time upon a silver cross before he departed to Balana, saying he would feign he had again escaped from Colombo because of the ill treatment of the Portuguese. (1)\n\nBut he went to Kandy and made known to the king everything which had transpired with the General Don Jeronimo, viz., that the General would conceal a troop of Portuguese soldiers near the fortress of Balana,\n\n* A Dutch mile is equal to about four English miles.\n\n\u2020 Casper Perere.\u2014Bald\u00e6us.\nso that as soon as the murder of the king was accomplished they would storm that fort. To this end had the Portuguese above-named come in order to help to murder the king at a good opportunity when he was asleep.\n\nAt night the king went in person with a large number of his best soldiers and entered into the fort of Balana. When the five Portuguese arrived there, they were joyously received by Dias, brought before the king, taken prisoners, and bound. Then a musket shot was fired from the fort as a signal, to those who lay in ambush, that the murder was accomplished, and they went in haste towards the fort. (1)\n\nBut a fugitive warned the Portuguese soldiers of what had occurred, and in great confusion they retreated again to Colombo, having suffered much hardship and lost all their baggage. The five Portuguese had with them very sharp Japanese knives called trassadoes, with which they intended to kill the king. They were sitting in Kandy in durance vile, while the king was relating all this to our General Joris van Spilbergen, to whom the king presented one of these Japanese trassadoes. (1)\n\n[1603.] Wimala Dharma Suriya sought the aid of Sebald de Weerdt, Vice-Admiral of the Dutch fleet of seven ships, which arrived at Batticaloa against the Portuguese. The plan was that De Weerdt should attack Galle by sea, and the king should besiege it by land. This design was frustrated by the murder of De Weerdt at Batticaloa. (1)\n\n[1604.] Soon after Wimala Dharma Suriya died, in 1604, and was succeeded by his stepbrother Seneviratna, who married Dona Catharina. The Portuguese were very glad about the death of the Emperor Don Jan, and sent several letters to Goa to inform the Viceroy of it and invade the whole Island. (2)\n\n[1607.] Affairs were in this state when the letter from Madrid, dated January 27, 1607, was written to Don Jeronimo de Azevedo, ordering the conquest of the Island.\n\n[1611.] Of the Portuguese General Don Jeronimo little more is known. Tennent calls him \u201ca soldier less distinguished for his prowess than infamous for his cruelties.\u201d In the account of the war of Constantine de S\u00e1 in Ceylon we learn that \u201cafter ruling Ceylon for eighteen years with fitful fortune Don Jeronimo passed to the superior grade of Viceroy of India, where he served the State\u2019s interests better than he did his own; for having to compete against the general opinion that he was rich, he gained when young the good fortune he deserved when old, being at that time spoken of as avaricious. He comported himself with great wisdom and circumspection, but in reward for all his services he died a prisoner in Lisbon Castle, apparently as an offender for the many misdeeds which his numerous enemies had laid to his charge.\u201d Faria y Souza says his reverses were a judgment from the Almighty for his barbarities in Ceylon. Fran\u00e7ois Pyrard, the French writer, calls him a very good Captain, but\nMr. Gray's note to this is that \"Pyrard was probably but a short time in Ceylon, and some soldier may have described this inhuman monster as a very good captain. His character may be estimated by his deeds, which included the tossing of Sighalese to alligators to amuse his troops, forcing mothers to pound their children, and other enormities.\"\n\n7. The Chairman inquired where \"Balana\" mentioned was?\n\nMr. Buultjens said that he believed it was near Kadugann\u00e1wa. He did not know by what name it was known in the present day.\n\nIt was remarked that perhaps the present Balana Telegraph Station on the railway incline beyond Alagalla was the place.\n\nThe Chairman said no doubt it was so. It appeared that the Portuguese attempted to take Kandy by the same road by which it was ultimately taken by the British, and across which their railway was now laid.* Of what description were the Japanese knives called trassadoes used by the five Portuguese, who intended to kill the Sighalese king by treachery?\n\nMr. Buultjens said he could not get any information about the knives except that they were Japanese.\n\nIt was suggested that the word trassadoe was Portuguese, such knives being known in Goa.\n\nThe Chairman then pointed out that the Mah\u00e1vans\u00e1 gave the accounts of the attacks of the Portuguese just a little after the reign of the king mentioned. It went to show that in these days certain merchants traded in Colombo, and those men were called Parangis, &c., the Portuguese.\n\n8. Mr. Green proposed, and Mr. E. R. Gooneratne seconded, a vote of thanks to the writers of the Papers.\n\nThe Chairman supported the resolution, which was cordially passed.\n\n9.

H. de Vos, Barrister-at-Law.\n\nThe title of this Paper has been suggested by that very interesting work entitled The Monumental Remains of the Dutch East India Company in the Presidency of Madras, by Alexander Rea, published by the Government of India.\n\nIn Ceylon, as in India, these remains consist in the main of tombstones, many of which have coats of arms engraved on them. To merely collect epitaphs and publish them with their translations, although useful in its way, will not, however, be doing justice to the subject, and I have therefore decided to treat the matter more fully from a genealogical and heraldic point of view. Before I proceed to discuss these tombstones, it is necessary that I should make a few prefatory observations of a general nature.\n\nIt should be noted that in the coats of arms on the tombstones in Ceylon the colours are rarely indicated. Sometimes we find the impalements and quarterings reversed, due to the engraver copying from a seal and not from its impression. That some animals are shown contourn\u00e9 is also due to this cause. The stonecutters in the Dutch times had doubtless in most cases to rely on the recollection of parties for descriptions of their coats of arms. Hence it is that, in some instances, the charges are scarcely recognizable. Arms were\n\n* See paragraph 4, page 209, ante. It was decided that this Paper be printed, but not read.\nsometimes impaled *per fess*, and crests are placed over the coats of arms of ladies\u2014a heraldic anomaly.\n\nAs regards the Sinhalese, it would not be quite correct perhaps to say that they had no system of heraldry. No doubt it did not obtain among them in the sense generally understood in Europe, but we have it on the authority of Fran\u00e7ois Valentyn* that the respective castes were distinguished by the flags they carried, on which distinctive devices were charged. Thus, the \"Visschers\" (Fishers) carried a white flag with a fish charged thereon. Those belonging to the *Magoel Doerawo* and *Nattanbowo* castes carried a white flag called an *Addelanchody*, with a red lion as its charge. The *Navandannajo* used a flag with an ape depicted on it. But the system in vogue in Europe, by which certain armorial bearings were assigned to and used by certain families, was unknown in the East. It is curious therefore to find in an account given by a Dutch traveller in Ceylon (Dr. \u00c6gidius Daalmans, 1687\u201389) of the obsequies of the King of Kandy, a description of the coat of arms of the king, which, he says, was \"on a field or a lion gules.\"\u2020\n\nAs regards the Portuguese, J. Ribeyro (Lee's translation, p. 46) says: \"There were more than 900 noble families resident in the town of Colombo (1656 A.D.).\"\n\nThe absence therefore of Portuguese tombstones with armorial bearings on them is remarkable. One, however, has been found bearing the De Fonseca arms, viz., *D'arg. \u00e0 cinq \u00e9toiles 2, 1, et 2.*\u2021 The Portuguese tombstones were most probably destroyed by the Dutch. This was the case in Jaffna.\u00a7 The Portuguese were also in the habit of carrying with them in their ships marble pillars with the arms of Portugal carved thereon, which they set up at every place they conquered.|| None of these have been discovered in\n\n---\n\n* \"Beschryvinge van het Eyland Ceylon,\"\n\u2020 Journal, R.A.S.C.B., vol. X., No. 35, p. 149.\n\u2021 See 2 C.L.R. 358.\n\u00a7 Journal, R.A.S.C.B., vol. X., No. 39, p. 312.\n|| See 3 C.L.R. 146; 4 C.L.R. 196\nCeylon, although Mr. Bell, the Archaeological Commissioner, came across a slab in the Beligal K\u00f3ral\u00e9 bearing the royal arms of Portugal.* The five escutcheons on the shield are placed saltire, but not cross-wise. A similar coat of arms has been recently discovered engraved on a rock in the Colombo Fort, with what looks like the date 1501 A.D. But the Dutch period compensates for any disappointment one may feel at the dearth of Portuguese coats of arms in Ceylon. The old Dutch churches and graveyards are rich in tombstones containing arms engraved thereon with varying degrees of merit.\n\nThe late Mr. Leopold Ludovici, in the year 1877, published his *Lapidarium Zeylanicum*, being a collection of the monumental inscriptions on the Dutch churches of Ceylon. The tombstones in the Dutch cemeteries are not included in this collection. In this Paper only the Dutch epitaphs in that work, and those not included therein which have been discovered scattered about the Island, are translated and discussed, and two coats of arms over two English epitaphs are noticed (Rabinel and Mylius).\u2020 Besides the verbal inaccuracies in the *Lapidarium Zeylanicum*, the copyist has committed the mistake of using lines for purposes of shading, which are apt to be mistaken for indications of the tinctures. The charges also, in some instances, have not been correctly reproduced.\n\nI have blazoned the arms in French, the language of heraldry. It will be out of place here to discuss the differences between English and Dutch heraldry. The curious reader is referred to J. B. Rietstap\u2019s *Handboek der Wapenkunde* and L. Philip. C. van den Bergh\u2019s *Grondtrekken der Nederlandsche Zegel-en Wapenkunde* for information on the subject. I have supplied the tinctures from Rietstap\u2019s *Armorial G\u00e9n\u00e9ral*. As regards the coats of arms which are not contained in this work, I have not filled in the colours\n\n---\n\n* Sessional Papers, Ceylon, 1891: Antiquarian Research, K\u00e9galla, p. 31.\n\u2020 \u201cLapidarium Zeylanicum,\u201d Plates 64 and 75.\nand metals, as I cannot regard the copyist's lines and dots as indications of them.\n\nIt is impossible to find English equivalents for the offices under the Dutch Government. I have therefore not attempted to translate them, nor to present in an English dress the redundant adjectives and honorifics so dear to the Dutchmen of that age.\n\nThe monogram of the Dutch East India Company was\u2014\n\nVereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (United East Indian Company). It was adopted on the 24th February, 1603, by a Resolution of the XVII.

The daughter could not have been born in 1695 if the father was born in 1687. Cornelis van der Parra was married to Gertruida Susanna Sparuyt. He had a son Rombout, baptized in Galle, 18th October, 1710. There is also a mistake in the date on the epitaph of the wife of Rombout van der Parra (Plate 93). The year 1607 is before the Dutch occupation. It may be that the Rombout referred to in Plate 93 is different from the Rombout baptized in Galle. The wife of the former was probably the daughter of Magnus Wichelman, Administrateur of Galle, and Susanna Durhee, who died in Galle, 3rd July, 1693.* The Durhee arms are found on the sinister impalement in the coat in Plate 94, L.Z., the birds,\n\n* See Plate 106, L.Z.\nhowever, not being contourn\u00e9 as in Plate 106, the dexter impalement in Plate 94, L.Z., being the Van der Parra coat. Cornelis van der Parra and Gertruida Susanna Sparuyt had another son, Petrus Albertus, born in Colombo, 29th September, 1714; married, firstly, 30th September, 1733, Elizabeth van Aerden, and secondly, 11th June, 1743, Adriana Johanna Bake, widow of Anthony Guldenarm, Commandeur. She was the daughter of David Johan Bake, Extraordinary Counsellor, Dutch Indies, and his wife Ida Dudde, and she died at Weltrevreden (Batavia), 18th February, 1787. Petrus Albertus entered the Company's service as a Soldaat by de Penne in 1728, and rose to the rank of Governor-General on the 15th May, 1761.

Mazius was one of those who escaped from the massacre of the Dutch at Formosa in the year 1661.\n\nThe above are the Dutch epitaphs in the *Lapidarium Zeylanicum*. Mr. J. P. Lewis, C.C.S. (to whom I am indebted for sketches of Plates 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 112, 133, and 134), speaking of the mistakes in the *Lapidarium Zeylanicum*, writes\u2020:\n\nIn the upper inscription on Plate 97, for OUTGAERT read RUTG\u00c6ERT, and for DESECOMPy read DER-E-COMPe. The letters are quite distinct and easily read. Ludovici only gives the shield, but it is surmounted by a helmet and crest, the latter the same figure of a bird as in the shield.\n\nThe two centre inscriptions are here given for the second time; for they had already appeared on Plate 8. A comparison of the two versions of each of these inscriptions will show how considerably they differ. I presume they are from tombstones in Colombo. The remaining inscription is more correctly\u2014\n\nANNACONSTAN\nTIA VA-Reede OUf\n6 M @ de N 9 NOV 1696.\n\n* See Plate 16, L.Z., for arms. \u2020 See 3 C.L.R. 343.\nThe letter like a Greek *theta* is the same as in inscription No. 4 above, and apparently stands for *obit*. Ludovici represents this stone as the same size as the one depicted at the top of the Plate, but in reality it is about half the size.\n\nPlate 98, upper inscription: for T. D. EER read D. EERB, for WARE read MARIA, for + VIS read HVIS, and for NARC read MARC; also for OVERLEEDEN read OVERLEDEN. Add at the end the sentence (which is cut in a running hand) \"Godt was en is Haar Lot\" \"God was and is her lot. (*Cf.* inscription No. 1 ante.) These two stones lie close together, and this inscription probably inspired the other. Perhaps this curious \"holy text\" is the composition of the \"Predikant\" Marc Mazius. I do not know what other origin it may have.\n\nLower inscription: for ELIZABET read ELISABET, for YAREN read YAAREN, and for 20 read 29.\n\nIf there is anything like the same proportion of mistakes in the rest of the inscriptions in the book as there is in these four, it decidedly requires revision.

Erected on the 24th April, 1687.\n\nRemarks.\u2014The word TUEN is evidently a mistake for VROUW.\n\nForbes, in his account of Ceylon (vol. II., p. 4), gives an account of the suicide of this Dutch lady, and the reasons which induced her to kill herself; and Sirr (vol. I., p. 112) relates substantially the same story. He also adds that \"some descendants of the lady's family are still in Ceylon.\"\n\nWhatever may be the Ceylon tradition, one Francina, Lady of Mydrecht, was the daughter of Hendrik Adrian van Rheede, Lord of Drakestein, afterwards, in 1680, Knight, \"beleend met de Ridderhofstad Mydrecht, en beschreeven in de Ridderschap des Lands Van Utrecht.\" Serjeant-Major Hendrik van Rheede was in Ceylon in 1668, when in October of the same year he was sent with a force to \"Ruanelle\" to wreak vengeance on the King of Kandy, whose emissaries had suddenly attacked the Company's servants in the \"Mendekaduiale\" and \"Atakalan\" K\u00f3ral\u00e9s and driven them away. History records that he was successful. In 1687 we find him \"Commissaris of the Coromandel Coast,\" and it was during his tenure of office as such that Francina took the fatal leap. Pyl, who was Governor of Ceylon, is said to have, about this time, paid a visit to Van Rheede at Negapatnam to have a conference with him about Ceylon affairs, and the King of Kandy waxed very wroth that notice of this visit was not given him. It is even said that one Mattamagoddy Chitty was sent from Kandy to Jaffna with\norders not to return without Pyl, and the Chief Adigar besought him to come as soon as possible to Colombo, as matters had reached an alarming crisis.\n\nHendrick van Reede died on the 16th December, 1691, close to Bombay, on board the ship \"Drechterland,\" on a voyage from Ceylon to Surat, and his embalmed body was buried close to Surat, in January, 1692. He was married to Johanna Schade, daughter of Johan Schade by his second wife, Elizabeth de Leeuw. His child by this marriage was Francina, who married (1) Captain Maurice C\u00e6sar de la Baye (who died in Colombo, 14th February, 1693), and (2) 1694, Anthony Carel van Panhuys, who died January, 1714.*\n\n---\n\nPlate 123, Galle.\n\nDE ERBARE EN DEUGDERYKE\nJUFFROVW ELISABETH DE HEES\nVAN VLISSINGEN HUYSVROVW\nVAN DEN FISCAAL DANIEL\nTISTE.

The pediment is the shape of an arc with its chord. The space within the pediment is decorated with the monogram of the Dutch East India Company in an ornamental setting. Over the door, carved in wood, are the arms of Governor van Eck.* Over this again is the name of the fort, which was called after the Governor who built it, \"Redoute van Eck.\" Below the coat of arms are his initials, L. I. V. E., and the date 1763. Although the material is wood, this piece of work is in perfect preservation.
