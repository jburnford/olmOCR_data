Pedler had consented to act as Treasurer during the temporary absence of Mr. J. Eliot.\n\nThe Secretary read a letter from the Under-Secretary to the Government of Bengal forwarding a copy of a letter from the Commissioner of the Orissa Division, reporting on the origin and growth of the sect of the Hindu Dissenters who profess to be the followers of Alekh.\n\nThe Commissioner of the Orissa Division writes:\u2014\n\n\"1. The founder of the sect is said to have been one Mukund D\u00e1s.\"\nHe lived for a long time in Puri as an Ach\u00e1ri Vaishnava, and was known as the Dhula B\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed from the fact of his daubing his body with ashes.\n\n\"2. About thirty years ago he left Puri and came to Dhenkanal, one of the Tributary States of Cuttack, where he selected as his dwelling-place the Kapil\u00e1s hills near a shrine of Mah\u00e1dev. During the first twelve years of his residence at Kapil\u00e1s, Mukund D\u00e1s lived on fruits and accordingly was known as the Phal\u00e1h\u00e1ri B\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed. The next twelve years were passed on milk and water which secured him the cognomen of Kshira-nira-p\u00e1yi.\n\n\"During his sojourn at Kapil\u00e1s, he was known to be a devout worshipper of the local idol, and took much pains in improving the place by cutting the jungle, making gardens, looking after the Bhog or sacred food of the idol, and taking care of the pilgrims who visit the hills periodically. This procured him the respect of the mother of the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dhenkanal, who supplied his food. He gradually succeeded in securing the respect of the people of the surrounding villages, and the popular belief was that he was in secret communion with the idol and could successfully intercede with it on behalf of its votaries. The currency of this belief was further facilitated by the fact of his taking special care of the sick people who resorted to Kapil\u00e1s for the benefit of their health, and very generally succeeded in getting it restored, and his visiting the temple at the dead of night while every one had retired to rest.\n\n\"3. After thus remaining at Kapil\u00e1s for several years, and finding that he had sufficiently established his reputation and secured the respect of the people, Mukund D\u00e1s left the place and began to preach that Mah\u00e1dev and the other idols worshipped by the Hindus were nothing else but stone and wood, and that the worship of these destructible articles was useless and of no avail, that the Creator of the universe was Alekh or Mahim\u00e1 (which literally means 'glorious') a spiritual Being without form, omnipresent and omniscient, and that he alone could hold communion with him and get his prayers granted. He eschewed his kaupin (waist cloth) and kanthi (wooden beads worn round the neck), the two distinctive features in the raiment of a Vaishnava, and wore kumbhipat (the bark of a tree called kumbhi) to cover his nakedness.\n\n\"4. From Kapil\u00e1s, Mukund D\u00e1s went to Puri, where he remained for some time in a hut on the sands near the temple of Lokan\u00e1th Mah\u00e1dev. He next came to Daruteng in the Government state of Khorda in Puri where he built a tung\u00ed (a place of worship), and commenced to propagate the new doctrine. It was at this place that Mukund D\u00e1s was deified and began to be addressed as the Mahim\u00e1 Gosain. It appears that one Gobind D\u00e1s was his first, and Narsing D\u00e1s his second disciple; others followed their example, and in course of time all these followers dispersed on all sides for\nthe propagation of the new doctrine; shortly after a place of worship was established at Malbeharpur in Kellah Banky; other places were opened in some of the remaining Tributary States as well as in Sambalpur, Puri and Cuttack. At some of these places of worship, the Mahim\u00e1 Gosain gave large feasts, which were numerously attended. In 1875 in the month of K\u00e1rtic on the day of the full moon, a fair was held at Jacka in Dhenkanal, where a large number of the followers of the Gosain assembled with rich presents including valuable clothes, silver utensils, &c. It is said that the B\u00e1b\u00e1j\u00ed, or Sw\u00e1mi as he was also addressed, offered these presents to the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dhenkanal, and on his declining to accept them they were openly burnt in the fire of the sacred Dhuni (fire kept up by religious mendicants). Thus in a few years the Mahim\u00e1 Gosain succeeded in making many disciples and followers, and on the days of the full moon thousands of men and women from distant parts of the country might have been seen wending their way to the tungis, with bangy loads of ghee, sugar and other valuable presents. It is said that at present the new faith is more popular in Sambalpur than in any other district. It is confined mostly to the ignorant and illiterate people of the lower classes of the Hindu community, who were, it is said, induced to adopt the new religion by hopes of enjoyment if they followed, and threats of perdition if they did not follow, its precepts.\n\n\"5. The disciples of the Mahim\u00e1 Sw\u00e1mi inculcate self-denial and resignation to God as the sources of salvation; they do not aspire after worldly greatness or pleasure; extreme humility is one of their characteristics. They have no prescribed mode of worship except praise of God and prayer for His mercy. They recognise the Bh\u00e1gavata, one of the religious books of the Hindus, but interpret it in a different way from the Hindus. They have a Malik\u00e1, or book of predictions, which treats of the incarnation of Alekh in the shape of Mahim\u00e1 Sw\u00e1mi to redeem the world from sin and to indicate the way to salvation. Besides this they have got another book containing songs and dialogues interpreting the truth of Alekh. Most of these songs, &c., are said to have been composed by Bh\u00edma Bhoi, a Khond, who is said to have been born blind, and afterwards endowed with sight by the Mahim\u00e1 Sw\u00e1mi.\n\n\"6. The following extract from the report of the Manager of Dhenkanal throws some light on the real sentiments of the Sw\u00e1mi.\n\n\"'The man who was at first called the Phal\u00e1hari Gosain was afterwards designated Mahim\u00e1 Gosain, and was believed to be an incarnation of the Almighty God. In the year 1874, while I was on tour in the interior of Dhenkanal, the founder of the Mahim\u00e1 or Alekh religion went with me from place to place and was with me for about a week, and I also saw him on several other occasions, but I never heard from him that he professed to be the Creator of the world as his disciples and followers believed him\nto be. From what I heard from him, I concluded that he believed that the Creator of the world was a spiritual Being, omnipresent and omniscient, without any form, whom he called Mahim\u00e1 and also Alekh Prabhu, and that he alone could communicate with the Alekh Prabhu and get down what he wished. He believed in the existence of the Hindu gods and goddesses, but said that they were under his commands, and that they were bound to obey whatever he wished them to do.\n\n\"7. The followers of the Alekh Sw\u00e1m\u00ed are divided into three sects:\n\"(1) The Kumbhipati\u00e1s, (2) The Konapati\u00e1s, and (3) the Asritas.\n\"The first two have renounced the world and deem celibacy essential. The males are called 'B\u00e1b\u00e1s' and the females 'M\u00e1t\u00e1s.' The difference between these two sects is that a Kumbhipati\u00e1 wears the bark of the kumbhi tree, and a Konapati\u00e1 pieces of rag. They beg from door to door, have no distinction of caste, and take their food only during the day-time at an open place beside a public road. They eat food cooked by people of any caste except the R\u00e9j\u00e1, a Br\u00e1hman and a washerman, whom they consider as sinful beings in this world, the R\u00e9j\u00e1 as he is responsible for the sins committed in his state, the Br\u00e1hman as he accepts all sorts of gifts from sinful persons, and the washerman as he washes sinful people's dirty clothes. They are not accustomed to live at any one place for more than a day, or to beg twice from the same house. They wear long matted hair, and do not bathe. They turn their head towards the sun at the time of rising and setting, and prostrate themselves several times to beg shelter and mercy of the Alekh Sw\u00e1m\u00ed. The Asritas do not forsake the world, nor do they deem celibacy essential; they bathe generally early in the morning, and clean their teeth with cowdung; they do not wear long hair, nor do they use kumbhipat or k\u00e1napat like their confr\u00e8res, but use geru\u00e1 basan or sloth coloured with geru or red earth like the Brahmach\u00e1ris of the Hindus; they do not observe any Hindu ceremony or festival, neither do they respect the gods of the Hindus. They perform their marriage ceremony in a very simple way by the side of a public road or thoroughfare; the bride puts a garland of flowers round the neck of the bridegroom in token of offering herself to him, and the friends and relatives of both loudly call upon their Alekh Sw\u00e1m\u00ed to protect the new pair in their career through life. Polygamy is prohibited among the Asritas. For any misconduct an offender is made to do penance by drinking a solution of cowdung. The Asritas consider the other two sects as their gurus or spiritual guides. The Tehsild\u00e1r of Ungul reports that the new faith of Mahim\u00e1 has wrought a change for the better on the P\u00e1ns of that killah, who are notorious for their thieving proclivities. Those who have accepted the new faith regard theft with abhorrence.\n\n\"8. In 1875, Mahim\u00e1 Sw\u00e1m\u00ed, who was believed to be immortal, died at Joranda in Dhenkanal, and the tungis, together with the gods and\nchattels they contained, were sold as intestate property. Most of the followers of the new faith, finding that the Sw\u00e1mi was no better than an ordinary mortal, disbelieved what he had inculcated and reverted to Hinduism. Those of his disciples and followers who had left their homes and friends and had been outcasted continued to practise the new faith they had embraced.\n\n\"9. At present there are only two places of worship in Dhenkanal, one at Joranda where Mahim\u00e1 Sw\u00e1mi died and was interred, and another at Mahalp\u00e1ra where Narsing D\u00e1s now lives. The Kumbhipati\u00e1s resort to the former and the K\u00e1napati\u00e1s to the latter of these places; they are reported not to be on good terms with each other. During the lifetime of Mahim\u00e1 Sw\u00e1mi, the Kumbhipati\u00e1s and K\u00e1napati\u00e1s were not regarded as distinct sects. Any person who wished to adopt the new religion first became an Asrita, which literally means protected. He was not required to leave his house and friends; afterwards if he wished to forsake the world he was required to eat with every person without distinction of caste and to remain at one of the places of worship called tung\u00eds. In this noviciate, he was allowed to wear cloth and was therefore called K\u00e1napati\u00e1. If after trial any of the K\u00e1napati\u00e1s was considered fit to be a Kumbhipati\u00e1, Mahim\u00e1 Sw\u00e1mi favoured him with a kumbhipat bark of the kumbhi tree, and from that time he was prohibited to wear cloth.\n\n\"10. The followers of Mahim\u00e1 Sw\u00e1mi appear to have had no leader since his death; they are scattered throughout the Gurjats of Orissa, in the Chattisgar Division of the Central Provinces, in the regulation districts of Orissa and in Ganjam, the adjoining district of the Madras Presidency. The system has, however, taken more in Sambalpur than elsewhere.\"\n\nMr. H. Rivett-Carnac exhibited a large number of stone implements, some of well known, and others believed to be of entirely new types, found by Mr. J. Cockburn and himself in the Banda District of the North West Provinces. The celts or stone hatchets of which the collection is chiefly composed were, he said, of a type long familiar to the Society, and many specimens had been figured and described at different times in the Society's Journal by Messrs. H. P. Le Mesurier, Ball, Cockburn and others. The old types resembled in every respect the implements found in Europe and other parts of the world and figured by Evans in his 'Ancient Stone implements,' and by Stephens in 'Flint Chips.' Some celts found in Banda by an officer of the Revenue Survey had come into Mr. Rivett-Carnac's possession some time ago and were presented by him through Mr. Francks, F. R. S., F. S. A., to the British Museum. Mr. Evans, F. R. S., the well known author of 'Ancient Stone Implements,' had seen these specimens and had urged the importance of a careful search being made for more\nspecimens and for new types. Mr. Cockburn, who had been recently employed in the Banda District, had kindly undertaken to conduct this search, and the careful and complete manner in which he had worked was shewn by what might fairly claim to be the magnificent collection of implements now submitted for the Society's inspection. During his cold weather tour in the Banda District, Mr. Rivett-Carnac had been fortunate enough to find a considerable number of celts in situ and a very fine specimen of a stone hammer or ring stone included in the collection. But by far the greater number of these most interesting specimens had been collected by Mr. Cockburn or men employed by him. In addition to the larger implements, Mr. Cockburn had found quantities of flint flakes some of a new and all of the most interesting types. It had been arranged that Mr. Rivett-Carnac should do his best to exhibit and describe the larger and commoner types and that Mr. Cockburn should undertake the description of the more delicate and most interesting specimens of flint flakes. Mr. Cockburn's recent severe accident would, it had been apprehended, have prevented him from attending the meeting, but Mr. Rivett-Carnac was glad to see him present and hoped that he would add a fuller description of the chief specimens of this interesting collection. Specimens of the celts or stone hatchets would be figured in the Society's Journal together with a full description of their size and weight which is of importance for the sake of comparison with those found in other parts of the world. It would hardly be necessary, however, to take up the time of the meeting now with these details.\n\nIt would be sufficient to point out first that the number of implements of this type was extraordinarily large, there being in all 366 celts or axes or portions of axes. The largest of these being 12\u00b725 in. long and 4\u00b770 in. broad and weighing 8 lb. 3 oz. The smallest 2\u00b750 in. long and 2\u00b715 in. broad and weighing only 8\u00bd oz. Two distinct types of this axe, or whatever the implement really was, were to be noticed, viz., what are classified by Evans (1) as the chipped or rough hewn celts, and (2) polished celts.\n\nThe chipped celts are exactly similar to the European specimens, and, as is the case also in Europe, are not so numerous as the latter class, the number in the collection being 100 chipped against 168 polished. It is generally supposed that these chipped celts are but the celts of class 2 in an unfinished stage, and that it was intended eventually to grind and polish them. The edges of some had been ground and may perhaps have been used in this unfinished state.\n\nAs regards the polished celts, they also are exactly similar to this class of implement found in Europe. Evans in his work has shewn the manner in which they were hafted and Mr. Cockburn will have something to say on the subject with respect to an old stone carving discovered by him in the Banda District on which a figure is to be seen holding in its hand a\nstone implement of this sort inserted into a handle exactly after the manner shewn in the ancient stone implements of Great Britain. In shape they nearly resemble the iron hatchet or little axe with its iron bands discovered in one of the circular tumuli of the Central Provinces and figured and described by Mr. Rivett-Carnac at page 6 of Vol. XLVIII of the Society's Journal. The stone celts were probably in some cases fixed on to the handle with bands of tude or string in the manner of the iron axe. A weapon of this shape was to be seen sculptured in one of the slabs of the Sanchi Topes, (photographed in Fergusson's 'Tree and Serpent Worship') in the hand of what Fergusson had described as a Dasyu, a description in which it was, however, believed Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra did not agree.\n\nThe stone selected for the celts is generally greenstone of various degrees of fineness, in some cases nearly approaching the porphyry. The extreme of this class of rock is a hard black material resembling basalt. Very rarely this black material is found perfectly polished. One or two of the smaller specimens have been recently polished on one side and an edge given to them in order to shew the condition in which it is believed they were used, and it would be seen that a really practical axe or hatchet could be made out of this rough stone.\n\nThe collection also contained celts with depressions similar to those found in Europe, hammer or ring-stones, two remarkable stone hammers of an entirely new type, a stone pestle and a stone ploughshare.\n\nThe last class comprises some dozen stones of peculiar shape, the exact use of which it was difficult to suggest. They were perhaps intended for pivots for doors. The best specimens of the collection will be selected for description in the Society's Journal.\n\nMr. John Cockburn read extracts from a paper about to be published in the Society's Journal under the joint authorship of Mr. J. H. Rivett-Carnac, C. I. E., and himself. He explained the forms, uses, and manufacture of stone implements and exhibited a collection of celts, arrow heads, knives, chisels, rasps, planes, and borers. The results of the authors' researches were epitomized under three heads:\n\nFirstly, the discovery of flint implements of types hitherto only found in Egypt and the islands of the Greek Archipelago.\n\nSecondly, the discovery of fossil bones found associated with stone implements, and in one instance bearing cuts supposed to have been made by such.\n\nThirdly, the finding of a bit of sculpture representing a man armed with a stone axe in its handle which has been assigned to a period between the 6th and 10th centuries. This date, if accepted by antiquarians, will, the authors are of opinion, be an important land-mark in the unwritten history of ancient India.\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. Note on a Copper-plate Grant from Cuttack.\u2014By R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra, LL. D., C. I. E.\n\nIn August last Mr. C. H. Tawney sent me, for decipherment, an inscription recorded on three plates of copper, which, he informed me, had been found at Cuttack by J. Winterscale, Esq. As Mr. Winterscale left Calcutta soon after, no information could be obtained as to the exact locale of the discovery of the plates, nor of the circumstances under which it was found.*\n\nThe plates measure 8-8 \u00d7 5-6 inches each, their thickness being one-tenth of an inch. They are held together by a thick copper ring with a clasp over the point where the two ends of the ring join. There is a misshappen knob on the clasp on which was formerly fixed a seal, which, however, having been badly soldered, has fallen off, and is now lost.\n\nThe plates are inscribed longitudinally, the first and the last on the inner side only, and the middle one on both sides. The number of lines inscribed on each side is thirteen, except on the last plate, on which there are thirteen lines and a half. The letters are of the Ku\u1e6dila type, and in an excellent state of preservation, except in a few places on the first and the last plates.\n\nThe language of the record is Sanskrit, and the purport, the gift of a village named Yantralenu, in district Samm\u00e1n\u00ed, in the province of Ko\u015bala, to one Uttamas\u00e1dh\u00e1ra\u1e47a, a Yajur V\u00e9dio Br\u00e1hman of T\u00e1kar\u00e1. The donor was ostensibly Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Mah\u00e1devagupta, son of S'ivagupta, but really a petty chief of Ko\u015bala, of the name of Kandarpadeva, who, not being himself competent according to the Sm\u1e5biti to grant land, which theoretically belongs to the paramount power, invokes his name, and dates it after him on the 13th of the waxing moon in the month M\u0101rgas'\u012brsha (November-December), in the 31st year of his reign.\n\nThe name of the ostensible donor has nowhere else been met with, but that of his father occurs in a copper-plate grant noticed by B\u00e1bu Rangal\u00e1la B\u00e1nurji in the Journal for 1877 (XLVI, Pt. I, pp. 149f.). That record was\n\n* Since writing the above I have seen a letter from Mr. Winterscale to the Secretary to the Society in which he gives the following account of his discovery of the plate:\n\n'The copper plate was found by me in 1879 at a place called Chowdw\u00e1r, about 3 miles from the left bank of the river Mah\u00e1nadi. About the year 1600 Chowdw\u00e1r was the stronghold of the Maharattas. I believe a copper plate was found about 1875 near the same place; it was deciphered by B\u00e1bu Rangal\u00e1la Banurji, a Deputy Collector and Deputy Magistrate. The plate found by me was only about 3 feet underground, and was covered with verdigris, &c. I tried to get the writing deciphered here, and had the plate cleaned by the aid of limes, &c., but otherwise it has not been meddled with in any way: the seal was damaged when I found it.'\nfound in an old box in the office of the Cuttack Collectorate, where it had lain since 1810, when it was filed as an exhibit in support of a claim for some rent-free land. That the two plates refer to the same person is borne out also by the fact that the same person, M\u00e1dhava, was the engraver of both the records, and the style of the letters is closely alike. If this identification be accepted we get three names of the same dynasty, thus\u2014\n\nI. Bhava-gupta.\nII. Siva-gupta.\nIII. Mah\u00e1deva-gupta.\n\nB\u00e1b\u00fa Rangal\u00e1l\u00e1 B\u00e1nurji assumed that the first two were scions of the later Gupta kings of Magadha, and that Yay\u00e1ti the actual donor was a lieutenant of Siva-gupta, and I have already accepted these assumptions to be correct.* Without them it is not possible to explain why Yay\u00e1ti, who was well known as a most powerful king of Orissa and founder of the K\u00e9sar\u00ed line, should, in a solemn religious patent, recite the name of Siva-gupta as the paramount sovereign. We know from the Aphs\u00e1r inscription that there was a long line of Gupta kings in Behar, and they called themselves the lords of the three Kal\u00edngas, and that Bhava-gupta was one of them, while there is nothing to show that there were any Gupta kings to the west or south of Orissa who could claim supremacy in that country. The progress of Yay\u00e1ti was from the north; he first took Y\u00e1japur, then Bhuvanesvara, and then Puri, and a paramount sovereign for him can be looked for only on the north, and that is Behar. And such being the case, the date of the record must be about the middle of the 6th century. Yay\u00e1ti's reign extended from A.D. 474 to 526, and he lived in the time of Siva-gupta, and the plates under notice are dated on the 31st of Mah\u00e1deva-gupta, the immediate successor of Siva-gupta. Had Yay\u00e1ti been living then, it is certain that so powerful a chieftain would have been named in the record, to give it weight, and as his name does not occur we must look for the date some time after A.D. 526.\n\nThe most serious objection to this identification would be the style of writing, which being Ku\u1e6dila, the inference would at once be drawn by some that the record is of the 10th century; but as I have already elsewhere shown that the Ku\u1e6dila character had a much wider range than a single century, it is not necessary to notice it here. The history of Orissa from the 7th century upwards is well known, and we have no Yay\u00e1ti son of Janamejaya in the Orissan history after that date.

Waldie and Mr. J. Eliot, Scrutineers.\n\nThe Chairman then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1881.\n\nThe Council have much pleasure in submitting the following Report of the state and progress of the Society during the past year.\n\nDuring the year 1881, 24 gentlemen were elected members of the Society. The elections of two of these and of three of those elected in 1880 were cancelled. Thirteen members withdrew from the Society, seven died, and the names of 5 were removed from the Member list in accordance with the provisions of Rule 40. The total number of Members therefore at the close of 1881 was 350 against 356* of the previous year. Of these 110 are Resident, 168 Non-Resident, 17 Foreign, 14 Life, and 41 Non-Subscribing Members.\n\n* The total number of Members at the close of 1880 was 356, and not 355, as stated in the last Annual Report, the name of one Member being by an oversight omitted in the last Member List.\nThe following table shows the fluctuations in the number of Ordinary Members for the past 6 years.\n\n| Year | Resident | Non-resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Tenant | Total | Grand Total |\n|------|----------|--------------|---------|-------|------|--------|-------|-------------|\n| 1876 | 119      | 175          | 294     | 6     | 48   | 53     | 347   |\n| 1877 | 112      | 165          | 277     | 4     | 46   | 50     | 345   |\n| 1878 | 117      | 152          | 269     | 11    | 29   | 42     | 327   |\n| 1879 | 111      | 154          | 265     | 12    | 36   | 48     | 329   |\n| 1880 | 112      | 155          | 267     | 14    | 39   | 44     | 356   |\n| 1881 | 110      | 163          | 273     | 14    | 41   | 55     | 350   |\n\nTo fill four of the vacancies in the Honorary Member List caused by the deaths of Sir John Phillippart, Count de Noe, Professor Isaac Lee, Colonel W. Munro and Sir J. W. Colville, the following Gentlemen were, on the recommendation of the Council, elected Honorary Members:\u2014Professor Hermann L. F. Helmholtz, Dr. Rudolph von Roth, Sir William Thomson and Professor William Wright. The remaining vacancy has been left unfilled for the present.\n\nThe Society has lost the following Ordinary Members by death during the year 1881:\u2014Major-General Edward Tuite Dalton, the author of the \"Ethnology of Bengal,\" and of several papers on the Geography and Ethnology of Assam published in the Society's Journal and Proceedings, Captain W. H. Johnstone, Kumar Kantichandra Singh, Mr. L. Mandelli, Mr. C. Magrath and Mr. W. M. Souttar.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nSir Ashley Eden, President, (from the date of his election in March), Mr. C. H. Tawney, Mr. H. Beverley and Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle have acted as Trustees on behalf of the Society. On Mr. A. Pedler leaving India in May, Mr. J. Elliot was elected Trustee in his place.\n\nThe following presentations have been made to the Museum, through the Society, during the year:\u2014(1) Weapons from the Andamans and the Nicobars presented by Mr. F. A. de Roepstorff; (2) Spindle whorls, fragments of clay figures, pieces of pottery and other antiquities found in excavations carried on at Jowhri Dih, presented by Mr. J. E. P. Lincke; (3) Hollow earthenware structures probably used as ornaments on a balustrade, and a brick from Moti Bazar, Bulandshahr, presented by Mr. F. S. Ghose.\nFinance.\n\nThe accounts (which will be found in the Appendix) have been kept in the mode introduced during the year 1880, and the Summaries are issued in the same form as was adopted last year.\n\nThe method has worked very satisfactorily during the year, and has, as was anticipated, considerably reduced the labour of their preparation and added to their clearness and precision.\n\nAn estimate of income and expenditure was prepared last year and laid before the Society at its Annual Meeting. According to this it was anticipated that the income would amount to Rs. 16,900 and the expenditure to Rs. 15,816 and that there would probably be a small balance on the favourable side of the accounts. This has not been realized. Owing largely to the exertions of the officers of the Society, on the one hand a much larger amount of the subscriptions for this year and the outstanding debts was collected than was estimated, and on the other a searching examination of the books showed that a larger amount was due from Members than was indicated by the accounts before this revision.\n\nThe income of the Society was Rs. 19,588-10-2 or Rs. 2,688 in excess of the anticipated amount.\n\nThe expenditure of the Society has, the Council regrets to state, been not only considerably in excess of the estimate but also of the income. The total for the year was Rs. 21,464-11-7 or Rs. 1,876-1-5 in excess of income.\n\nThis large expenditure is mainly due to increase in the important item of Publications. The estimate passed by the Council was Rs. 6,310, whilst the actual expenditure was Rs. 9,195-14-7.\n\nAs the income of the Society barely suffices to pay the expenses as shewn by estimate, it is, we consider, essential that measures should be taken to secure due control over expenditure under this head, so that the Honorary Secretaries in charge of publications may limit their expenditure to the amount allowed for the year.\n\nThe only other item in which the increase is very marked is that of postage. This is due to the fact that the Society's Journals and Periodicals are now forwarded by post in all cases to Members, whether in India or in Europe.\n\nWith the exception of this point the financial condition of the Society is on the whole satisfactory. The Cashier recently engaged under arrangements made by Mr. Douglas has taken much trouble and has performed his duties satisfactorily.\nThe following is the estimate of income and expenditure for the year 1882.\n\n**Receipts.**\n\n| Description            | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions         | Rs. 8,250 |\n| Sale of Periodicals   | Rs. 1,000 |\n| Admission Fees        | Rs. 1,000 |\n| Interest on Investment| Rs. 6,650 |\n\nTotal Receipts: Rs. 16,900\n\n**Expenditure.**\n\n| Description            | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Salaries              | Rs. 4,570 |\n| Commission            | Rs. 350 |\n| Pensions              | Rs. 228 |\n| Stationery            | Rs. 250 |\n| Lighting              | Rs. 80 |\n| Building              | Rs. 60 |\n| Taxes                 | Rs. 720 |\n| Postage               | Rs. 1,000 |\n| Freight               | Rs. 50 |\n| Meetings              | Rs. 100 |\n| Contingencies         | Rs. 400 |\n| Books                 | Rs. 1,500 |\n| Local Periodicals     | Rs. 60 |\n| Binding               | Rs. 500 |\n| Coins                 | Rs. 50 |\n| Printing and Publications | Rs. 8,850 |\n| Plates                | Rs. 2,450 |\n\nTotal Expenditure: Rs. 16,758\n\n**London Agency.**\n\nMessrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co.'s accounts showed a balance at the end of 1880 of \u00a349-9-0\u00bd in their favour. The sale proceeds of the Society's publications sold by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. during that year amounted to \u00a379-19-2, and of the Bibliotheca Indica to \u00a367-11-0. Fifteen invoices of books purchased and of publications of different Scientific Societies sent in exchange were received from Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. during 1881. The value of the books purchased amounted to \u00a3181-5-6: 524 copies of the Journal, 961 copies of the Proceedings and 822 copies of parts of the Bibliotheca Indica were sent to Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. for sale.\nThe copies of the Journal, Proceedings and Bibliotheca Indica for 1881, intended for Societies and Members in Europe, were sent by post instead of through Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner and Co. as has hitherto been done.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe additions to the Library during the year amount in all to 1,845 volumes or parts of volumes, 1,092 of which were presentations or were received in exchange for the Society's publications, and 753 were purchases.\n\nThe Catalogue of the Library is now passing through the press under the superintendence of Mr. H. B. Medlicott. The Council regret that the work is progressing very slowly owing to the inaccuracy and want of arrangement in the manuscript Catalogue. In consequence of this, the Catalogue had to be almost entirely re-arranged before it could be sent to press; and it is necessary for the Assistant Secretary in revising the proofs to check the correctness of the titles of the books by comparing them with the books themselves. The Council, however, hope that the Catalogue will be published and distributed to Members in the course of the ensuing year.\n\nThe work of cataloguing the Sanskrit books and manuscripts, for which a special Pandit was engaged, is nearly completed, and satisfactory progress has been made by the Munshi engaged to catalogue the Persian and Arabic books and manuscripts. For the purpose of preserving the manuscripts from the ravages of insects, it was decided on the proposal of Dr. Mitra to treat certain of them with a preparation of arsenic, and a duftry was temporarily engaged for that purpose.\n\nPublications.\n\nDuring the past year the following Nos. of the Journal and Proceedings were published: Journal Part I, Nos. 1\u20144 of 1881, containing 251 pages of letterpress and 20 plates; Extra No. to the Journal, Part I for 1880 containing 171 pages; Journal Part II, No. 4 of 1880, and Nos. 1\u20144 of 1881, containing 354 pages and 17 plates.\n\nProceedings, No. 10, of 1880 and Nos. 1\u20148 of 1881, containing 176 pages and 3 plates.\n\nBuilding.\n\nThe sum spent on repairs during 1881 was very trifling, amounting to Rs. 461.8-9. Of this amount Rs. 350 was paid for the repairs of the road in the compound.\n\nCoin Cabinet.\n\nAltogether 95 coins were acquired during the past year: of these 62 were purchased; the remainder, 33, are presentations.\n\nAmong the purchases there are 4 gold (see Proceedings 1880, p. 40),\n32 silver (including the 14 early Muhammadan coins found near Gauhati, *ibid*, p. 52), and 26 copper coins.\n\nAmong the presentations are: 2 Jaunp\u00fbri silver coins from R\u00e2j\u00e1 Udayaprat\u00e2pa Sinha of Bhinga, Oudh (*ibid*, p. 41); 2 old Hindi and one Khal\u00eefa silver and one unknown copper coin from Mr. Holguette (*ibid*, pp. 41, 42); 14 copper coins from the Political Agent, Bundelkhand; one copper coin from the Magistrate of Fatehpur; 12 copper coins from the Political Agent, Charkharee.\n\n**Secretary's Office.**\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle has continued to act as Philological Secretary throughout the year.\n\nDuring Mr. Wood-Mason's absence from Calcutta, from January to September, Mr. V. Ball officiated as Natural History Secretary, and on the resignation of Mr. J. Douglas in March he also took up the duties of Treasurer.\n\nOn Mr. Ball's leaving India in September, Mr. J. Wood-Mason resumed the Natural History Secretaryship and Mr. J. Eliot was appointed Treasurer. Mr. H. F. Blanford and Mr. A. Pedler officiated as Treasurer on two occasions when Mr. Eliot was absent from Calcutta.\n\nMr. A. Pedler resigned the General Secretaryship in April and Dr. H. W. M'Cann was appointed in his place. During Dr. M'Cann's absence from the middle of May to middle of June, Mr. Eliot officiated as General Secretary; and during Dr. M'Cann's absence in November, Mr. Wood-Mason officiated as Secretary.\n\nMr. W. A. Bion and Mr. E. S. Andrews have continued to hold the posts of Assistant Secretary and Assistant Librarian respectively.\n\nBabu Ram Jivan Mukerji, the Cashier, was dismissed in January, and Babu Nritya Gopal Basu was appointed Cashier. The services of the Babu employed temporarily to index the Society's old Records were dispensed with at the end of January, as it was found advisable to do so on financial grounds. A copyist was appointed in May on Rs. 15 per mensem.\n\n**Bibliotheca Indica.**\n\nTwenty fasciculi were published during the year; sixteen in the Sanskrit and four in the Arabic-Persian Series. They belong to thirteen different works, of which three belong to the Arabic-Persian and ten to the Sanskrit Series. Among them two in the Sanskrit and one in the Arabic-Persian Series have been completed, and four, all in the Sanskrit Series, have been commenced. The former are the *Taittiriya Samhita*, and the *Turikh-ul-Khulfa*; the latter are the *Patanjala Yoga Sutra*, the *Apastamba Srauta Sutra*, and the English Translation of the *Lalita-Vistara*. One work, the *Vishnu Smriti*, has been both commenced and completed during the year.\nAmong these publications there are four English Translations; viz., of the Tarikh-ul Khulfa in the Arabic-Persian Series, and of the Katha Sarit Sagara, the Lalita Vistara and the Pata\u00f1jala Yoga Sutra, in the Sanskrit Series. There are also ten text editions, two in the Arabic-Persian and eight in the Sanskrit Series. Of the Pata\u00f1jala Yoga Sutra both text and translation are being published pari passu.\n\nA. Arabic-Persian Series.\n\n1. Of the Isaba or Biographical Dictionary of persons that knew Muhammad, by Ibn Hajar, one fasciculus has been published by Maulvi 'Abdul Hai, Head Professor of the Calcutta Madrasah.\n\n2. Major H. S. Jarrett has published the sixth fasciculus of his annotated English translation of the Tarikh-ul-Khulfa, or the History of the Caliphs by Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn as Suy\u00fati. This concludes the work.\n\n3. Of the Akbarnama, edited by Maulvi 'Abdur Rah\u00edm, two fasciculi have been published. These commence the third Volume of that work.\n\nB. Sanskrit Series.\n\n4. Pandit Mahesachandra Nyayaratna, Principal of the Sanskrit College, has brought out the thirty-second fasciculus of his edition of the Taittir\u00edya Samhit\u00e1, containing the earliest recensions of the mantras of the Black Yajur Veda together with the commentary of M\u00e1dhava Ach\u00e1rya. This completes the fourth volume of that work.\n\n5. The same editor has issued one more fasciculus of the text of the Mimamsa Dar\u015bana, a critical commentary on the ritual of the Veda, accompanied by the commentary of S\u00e1vara Sv\u00e1min. This is the fifth of the Society's series of the six Dar\u015banas. The texts of four have been already published; and the sixth is the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, mentioned below (No. 12).\n\n6. Dr. R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra has advanced his edition of the text of the V\u00e1yu Pur\u00e1na by one fasciculus, the first of the second volume. This is the second of the Society's Series of the Pur\u00e1nas, a sort of Cyclop\u00e6dias of Sanskrit Literature. The first is the Agni Pur\u00e1na, a complete edition of which has already been published by the same learned editor.\n\n7. Mr. C. H. Tawney, M. A., Principal of the Presidency College, has published three fasciculi of the second volume of his English translation with notes of the Katha Sarit Sagara or the Ocean of Streams of Story. Four more fasciculi will probably complete this work, which is the celebrated repository of Indian legends composed from older sources by Somadeva of Kashmir toward the close of the eleventh century. The stories are illustrated by notes which refer to similar legends current in other collections of folklore.\n8. Pandit Satyavrata S\u0101ma\u015brami has brought out three fasciculi of his edition of the N\u012brukta, the well known glossarial explanation of obscure Vedic terms, together with extracts from various commentaries.\n\n9. One fasciculus has been published of Hemadri's Chaturvarga Chin-tamani by the joint-editors, Pandits Yogesvara Sm\u1e5btitratna and K\u0101makhy\u0101-n\u0101tha Tarkaratna. This commences the fifth part of the work, the Pari\u015besha Khanda; it is, however, the third volume of the Society's series, manuscripts for two parts being wanting.\n\nAmong the works which were announced in the Annual Report of last year to be in course of preparation (see Proceedings 1880, p. 29), are the following, portions of which have been published:\n\n10. The Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Sm\u1e5bti, by Professor Jolly of W\u00fcrzburg, containing the text with extracts from various commentaries. The whole work has been already completed in two fasciculi.\n\n11. The \u0100pastamba \u015arauta S\u016btra, a very rare and important work connected with the Black Yajur Veda, edited by Professor R. Garbe of K\u00f6nigsberg, together with the Commentary of Rudradatta. Two fasciculi of this work have been issued.\n\n12. The Yoga S\u016btra of Patanjali, of which the first fasciculus has been published by Dr. R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra. The text is accompanied by the commentary of Bhoja R\u0101j\u0101 and an English translation of both the text and commentary; also by an English commentary compiled by the editor himself, including short extracts from the commentaries of Vy\u0101sa Vij\u00f1\u0101na Bhikshu and Vachaspati Mi\u015bra.\n\n13. The same editor has issued the first fasciculus of his English translation of the Lalita-Vistara, one of the most ancient and important works on the earlier portion of the life of Buddha.\n\nContinuations of the following works are being prepared:\n\n1. \u1e6cabaq\u0101t-i-N\u0101\u1e63ir\u012b by Ab\u016b 'Umar-i-Ugm\u0101n, translated by Major H. G. Raverty. One more fasciculus will complete this valuable work.\n\n2. The Pr\u0101k\u1e5bta Lak\u1e63a\u1e47a by Chand\u0101, a Grammar of the Ancient Prakrit, edited by Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle. The second fasciculus, containing translation and notes, is nearly ready.\n\n3. The Prithih\u0101j R\u0101sau, by Chand Bard\u0101i; text and translation, by Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle.\n\n4. The K\u0101tantra, with the Commentary of D\u016brga Simha, edited with notes and indexes, by Dr. Julius Eggeling. One fasciculus with the introduction remains.\n\nThe following works are in course of preparation:\n\n5. The Brihaddevat\u0101, a very interesting metrical work of Saunaka on the deities invoked in the hymns of the Rig Veda, edited by Dr. R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra.\n6. The Charaka, the oldest work on Hind\u00fa Medicine translated with notes, by Dr. Mahendral\u00e1la Sark\u00e1r.\n\nThe following works have been newly sanctioned for publication, and are being prepared:\n\n7. The Par\u00e1sara M\u00e1dhava Smriti, to be edited by Pandit Chandrak\u00e1nta Tark\u00e1lank\u00e1ra, who has just completed an able edition of another law book, the Gobhill\u00e1ya Sutra.\n\n8. The Su\u015bruta, an ancient Hind\u00fa Medical work, hardly less important than the Charaka, to be translated with notes, by Dr. U. C. Datta.\n\n9. The Naq\u00e1id of el Feraz\u00e1q and Jerir; an extremely interesting work, both from the philological and historical point of view; text and commentary; to be edited by Professor Wright of Cambridge (see Proceedings, 1880, p. 65).\n\n10. The L\u00e1miyyet-el-Arab, text, with two English translations, one in prose and the other in verse, by Mr. C. J. Lyall, B. A., C. S.\n\n11. The Muntakh\u00e1b-ul-Tawar\u00edkh by 'Abdul-K\u00e1dir, second volume, by Rev. W. H. Lowe, M. A., of Cambridge. The text, in 3 volumes, has been already published by the Society.\n\nThe following is a detailed list of the publications issued during 1881:\n\n**Arabic-Persian Series.**\n\n1.

Rivett-Carnac, and read the following notes on them:\n\nSome time ago I received from our enthusiastic and indefatigable associate, Mr. Rivett-Carnac, a necklace made of three large and sixty-two small silver coins, which he wished me to examine. The coins had little loops so soldered on their edges as not in any way to injure them; but they were mostly in a bad state of preservation, with the legends obliterated in many cases. I have availed myself of my friend's permission to separate the coins, which were held together by small silver links, whose points not having been soldered could be easily detached.\n\nThe three large coins belong to the mintage of Nepal. One of them (No. 1) is of R\u00e1jendra-vikrama Sh\u00e1h, and bears date S\u00e1ka 1738, and the other two are of Surendravikrama Sh\u00e1h, dated, No. 2 S\u00e1ka 1776 and No. 3, S\u00e1ka 1792, respectively.\n\nThe small coins are obviously from Guzarat, but the exact locality where they were found is not known. They all belong to the Sh\u00e1h kings of Sur\u00e1shtra, but 19 of them are so defaced that no name can be read on them. The others represent the following reigns:\n\n1. Rudra Si\u00f1ha, son of Rudrad\u00e1ma (the 3rd king of the line according to Mr. Newton's list).\n2. Rudra S\u00e1h, son of Rudra Si\u00f1ha (4th king).\n3. Yasad\u00e1ma, son of D\u00e1ma S\u00e1h (6th king).\n4. \u00cd\u015bvaradatta. (9th king).\n5. Vijaya S\u00e1h, son of D\u00e1ma S\u00e1h (10th king).\n6. Rudra S\u00e1h, son of Virad\u00e1ma (12th king).\n7. Vi\u015bva Si\u00f1ha, son of Rudra S\u00e1h (13th king).\n8. Atrid\u00e1ma, son of Rudra S\u00e1h (14th king).\n9. Vi\u015bva S\u00e1h, son of Atrid\u00e1ma (15th king).\n10. Rudra S\u00e1h, son of Jinad\u00e1ma (16th king).\n11. \u00c1sad\u00e1ma, son of Rudra S\u00e1h (17th king).\nJames Prinsep was the first to bring to public notice this class of coins, and to prepare a sketch which has since been filled up, by the labours principally of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Newton, with notices of nineteen kings whose names do not occur in any historical record. Mr. Newton's paper, in the 7th volume of the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, is, I believe, the latest contribution on the subject, and it is so full, having been written after a very careful examination of several hundred specimens, that little remains to be added, as regards the coins that have been already discovered. The coins before me do not contribute any new name; nor do they throw any additional light on the history of the kings noticed. There are, however, some points in the decipherment of the legends which suggest a few remarks.\n\nThe first point is the title Kshatrapa which the kings assume. When Prinsep first read the legends, he found, after the initial title r\u0101jna \"of a king,\" certain letters which he read kritrima, in others mah\u0101kritrima. Commenting upon them he said, \"The second word of the title I read \u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092e\u093e for \u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f kritrimasya, genitive of kritrima, which is translated in Wilson's Dictionary 'made, factitious, an adopted son' (for kritrimaputra). The latter sense was inadmissible, because it so happened that the name of the actual father was, in every case, inserted and the same title was also applied to him. The only manner, therefore, in which the term could be rendered was by 'elected,' 'adopted'\u2014(by the people, or by the feudal chiefs of the country)\u2014a designation entirely new in Indian numismatics, and leading to a highly interesting train of reflection, to which I must presently recur. Sometimes the epithet mah\u0101 is affixed\u2014not to r\u0101j\u0101, but to kritrima, as r\u0101j\u0101 mah\u0101kritrima, the 'great or specially elected king'\u2014as if in these cases he had been the unanimous choice of his people, while in the others he was installed merely by the stronger party in the state.\"\n\nHe had, however, to change this opinion when he deciphered the J\u016bnagar inscription of Rudrad\u0101ma. There the reading was distinctly and most unquestionably mah\u0101kshatrapa (Thomas' Prinsep, II, p. 63), and this reading has since been generally adopted. It is worthy of note, however, that the crucial letter in the word is the 3rd. If we read it m (\u092e) the reading should be kritrima, but if we take it for p (\u092a) the reading would be kshatrapa, the mechanical configuration of the first two compound letters being such that they admit of either reading. Now the letter p occurs on all the coins either as a square with the top open and a perpendicular stroke at the anterior corner, thus \u092a, or as a perpendicular line with a curved spur at the middle on the left side, thus \u092a. The curvature of the spur varies greatly in different specimens, but the leading perpendicular line is constant. This is, however, not the letter that we meet in the title; there it occurs like the English letter V formed of two oblique lines with the\nlower ends in some cases projecting below the angle, thus V. It is generally found in the same form in the word mah\u00e1, but in some cases thus V. In unquestionable test words such as putrasa or prathama the p never assumes this form in any of the 62 specimens now before me, nor in some 50 specimens that I had seen before, nor also in the various plates published by Wilson, Prinsep, Thomas and Newton. Mr. Newton had between five and six hundred specimens before him, and was, therefore, in a much better position to pronounce authoritatively on the subject than I am; the evidence at hand would suggest the idea that there is room yet to raise the question as to whether the word should be read kritrima or kshatropa; but, bearing in mind the fact that the evidence of the coins is doubtful and unsatisfactory while that of the inscription is unquestionable, adherence must be given to the latter.\n\nThe next point is as to whether the word dama should be read with two long vowels, or with the first vowel long and the second short. The original form of the word in the Sanskrit language is d\u00e1man, a \"garland,\" and that this is the word used in the coin is evident from the possessive form in which it is used being d\u00e1mna. In the nominative singular d\u00e1man becomes d\u00e1m\u00e1, but when it is a member of a compound term, as in Vira-d\u00e1ma, the last vowel should be short, and the word declined as a theme ending in a and not n. The writers of the legends, however, seem to have been unmindful of this grammatical distinction. In the coin of Rudra-d\u00e1ma, the possessive is as it should be Rudrad\u00e1masa, but in those of Atri-d\u00e1ma and \u00c1sad\u00e1ma the corrupt forms of Atrid\u00e1mna and Asad\u00e1mna have been used.\n\nThe last point to which I wish to refer is as to the religion of the S\u00e1h kings. According to Prinsep it was Buddhism. He said\u2014\"It is remarkable that, in the long string of epithets applied even to Rudra D\u00e1m\u00e1, the chosen Satrap, there is none which bears the slightest allusion to Hindu mythology; while, on the other hand, the coins of the whole dynasty bear an emblem we have hitherto considered either of Mithraic or of Buddhist import. The name of Jina D\u00e1m\u00e1 ('Wearing Buddha as a necklace') is decidedly Buddhistic; and the epithet applied in the inscription to Rudra D\u00e1m\u00e1\u2014who from right persuasion never put any living creature to death\u2014proves that Rudra's opinions were at any rate influenced by the proximity of the important Buddhist establishment at Girnar.\" Mr. Thomas demurs to this. He says, \"As it is not proposed to show that the S\u00e1hs were Brahmanical Hindus, the first point requires neither comment nor answer; in respect to the second, as the word Jina can now be proved to have been incorrectly read in the place of Jiwa the argument founded on the previous interpretation at once falls to the ground; and for the third position, it also is equally based on error, arising from an inaccurate render-\ning of the original passage in the inscription; notwithstanding all this, there is some reason to concur in the idea itself, that the S\u0101h kings were 'influenced by the opinions of the Buddhists, though this by no means implies a complete desertion of the old faith.'\u201d (J. R. A. S., XII, p. 28.)\n\nThe first argument of Prinsep appears to be unaccountably hasty. The word Rudra is positively and unquestionably Hindu. It occurs in the Vedas as the name of a god, and for the last two thousand years and more has been accepted as an alias of \u015aiva; and this name is just what the S\u0101h kings most affected. The word I\u015bvara in I\u015bvaradatta is also another positively Hindu word which the Buddhists never recognised. It is the name of the Supreme divinity, which the Buddhists, at least the early Buddhists, never acknowledged; and these two words should leave no doubt in the mind that the earlier S\u0101h kings were Hindus. The word Atri, the name of a Hindu sage, supports this inference.\n\nAs regards the second argument the correction suggested by Mr. Thomas seems not to be tenable. The letter in my specimen is a and not e, and in the numerous specimens which Mr. Newton had before him he found a; at least he, having Mr. Thomas\u2019s essay before him, did not accept the reading Jiva. Jina, however, does not necessarily imply Buddhism. Seeing that Jainism prevailed and still prevails in Western India, the presumption is strong that Jainism is what is implied by the term, and not Buddhism. Jinad\u0101ma was not one of the S\u0101h kings; his title is sv\u0101mi, or a priest, a learned Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or a saint, whose son Rudra Siha became the 16th king, and the inference these facts would suggest is, that the earlier kings were all Brahmanical Hindus, and on a change of dynasty the 16th king became a Jain, and the three subsequent kings with whom we are acquainted followed his faith. Nor need the symbolic indications or the obverse stand in the way of this inference. The central symbol is a tumulus formed of three segments of circles placed on a curved or wavy line, and Prinsep took it for a chaitya, which at once allied the kings with Buddhism; but on the other hand the crescent moon, the sun, and the stars associated with it are decidedly Hindu; and if the symbols be of a religious character it is difficult to reconcile them with the assumption that the tumulus means a chaitya. I am disposed, therefore, to accept the tumulus to stand for a mountain, \u201cthe sunrise hill,\u201d Udayagiri, over which the celestial luminaries are placed, or \u201cthe hill city,\u201d (Girinagara referred to in the Girn\u0101r record), which formed the capital of this dynasty of kings. The simplest way of depicting a hill is by putting together segments of circles, and this is exactly what has been done on the coins; there was neither space enough on the coins, nor talent sufficient at command to do anything better. If this conjecture be accepted it would follow that the earlier S\u0101hs were heliolaters, and from that the later ones passed to the worship of the T\u012brthankaras.\nLIST OF COINS.\n\nNEPALESE COINS.\n\nNo. 1.

No name legible.\n\nMr. Gibbs said he thought the Society was much indebted to Dr. Mitra for the trouble he had taken with reference to the coins on the table which were in as bad a condition as any he (Mr. Gibbs) had seen. He had come hoping that the necklace which Mr. Rivett-Carnac had sent was one belonging to his connection Mrs. Temple which Mr. Gibbs had examined at Poona in 1877 or 1878, and which contained two or three new varieties, but he had been disappointed. Coins of this series had of late years become common. He had a good many himself, and Mr. Newton\nhad from time to time acquired large numbers: it was only some few that were difficult to procure, but Dr. Mitra had given them an interesting paper on very poor materials.\n\nMr. Gibbs then exhibited a gold Ramtinki which was handed round. It was cup-shaped, 1\u00bd in. in diameter, and had in the interior Ram and Sita seated on a musnud, with three attendants on the left of the spectator, and four on the right; on the back was Hanuman the monkey god, and round him an inscription which had not been read; weight 1 tola 2 annas. Mr. Gibbs explained that he had been led to bring this coin as he had noticed in a recent volume of the Proceedings that his friend General Pearce at Madras had sent one which had been figured; but this was an imitation, and one of those flat ones now made for pilgrims at one of the shrines near Bellary. During the famine of 1876-77, Mr. Gibbs had obtained 7 or 8 of these curious pieces, two of 4 tolas each, the rest of 1 tola; 3 of them had been known to have been part of the treasure of a temple in the S. M. country for 600 years, and were sold during the time of distress; there is a 2 tola one in the Museum of the Bombay Branch of the R. A. Society, which formed part of the late Mr. W. E. Trevor's collection. Mr. Gibbs had not had time to prepare a paper on these curious objects of worship rather than coins. They were used in washing the idol with gold which was done by pouring gold coins over it. But he had seen sufficient to know that the older ones were of the poorer gold, being much alloyed with silver, whereas the modern ones are nearly all of very good if not pure gold. He hoped before long to be able to bring out a paper on this subject, and in the mean time should be glad of any information he could get regarding these pieces.\n\nDr. Mitra exhibited four silver coins lately received from Mr. Cockburn, who obtained them from E. Rose, Esq., C. S., Joint-Magistrate of Kirwee, in the vicinity of which town they were discovered. The coins were in a very bad state of preservation, and originally had been very badly prepared, the disks being about half the size of the dies with which they had been struck. From slight remains of the legend one of the coins appeared to belong to the class of the Var\u0101ha coins, and the others to the Kanauj group of the 11th century with two balusters on the reverse, as figured in Prinsep's Indian Antiquities, Vol. I, plate XXIV, fig. 17.\n\nMr. J. Cockburn exhibited a Panchamukha Lingam, and said:\n\nThe object exhibited this evening is a multiple Phallus of an uncommon shape known as a Panchanan or Panchmukhi ling. It was found by me along with a heap of fragments of sculpture, celts &c. on a\nsmall platform just outside the village of Uchah in the Augassie pargannah of the Banda district. There was another larger specimen in the same place which varied a good deal in detail, but was too heavy to remove easily. They both lay comparatively unnoticed among the other fragments, and it would not appear that the people of this village attached any importance to them, though worshippers of Shiva and Parvati in the personifications of the Ling and Yoni. The significance of these latter emblems I have found to be fully understood by every intelligent Hindu I have questioned on the subject.\n\nThe glorious science of Anthropology marks the dawn of a new era in philosophy, and no apology is I conceive needed for describing an emblem worshipped in some shape or other by two-thirds of those professing the Hindu religion.\n\nThe only reference I have been able to find to the Panchanan ling is by Lieut. F. Maisey in his account of the antiquities of Kalinjar, J. A. S. Vol. XVII, pp. 177, 187, 198, Pl. XIII, fig. 22. No description has been given and the specimen figured in Plate XIII is a purer and more conventional form than any I have come across.\n\nThe specimen figured by Lieut. Maisey may be described as a group of five hemispherical prominences arranged in a quinquarticular shape in the centre of a square: with four smaller similar groups at the four angles. The slab is often thick and the surface is excavated while a small spout projects on one face for the purpose of draining off water. This spout may represent the fourchette of a yoni formed by the inscribed square.\n\nThe specimen found by me is a block of mottled sandstone about 6\u00bd inches square on the surface and 3\u00bd inches thick. The side faces are ornamented with the usual moulding which has the effect of giving it the appearance of a miniature altar. Slotts in the basal angles indicate that it was clamped to some larger object. The upper surface is excavated to the depth of a quarter of an inch and the spout has been broken off. It thus forms a bagha or yoni. This inner square is occupied by four hemispherical prominences 2\u00bd inches in diameter arranged in a quartette, one in each angle of the square while in the centre is a similar hemisphere more prominent than the others and raised about half an inch higher. The arrangement is thus quinquarticular. Attached to the central hemisphere is a small perpendicular Priapus, which in the specimen left behind had evidently a well marked glans. Between each of the hemispheres is a small ridged keel an inch in length. This keel, the central portion of which is concealed, is in the shape of a crux ansata.\n\nWithout any offence to delicacy I will attempt to interpret this symbol. The central hemisphere and erect projection represent a basal view\nof the male generative organ. The four outer hemispheres taken in conjunction with the central one represent a pair of testes in any direction it is possible to view the sculpture. The ridged keels represent the median raphe of the scrotum. This last surmise has received unexpected confirmation in a specimen of a Punchanan ling from Kalinjar in the collection of the Indian Museum. In this specimen the artist has hit upon the expedient of serrating the ridge in imitation of the plications of the scrotum when contracted by cold.\n\nDr. Inman in his work 'Ancient Faiths and Modern' has collected much curious and forgotten lore regarding the prevalence of a Phallic element in past and existing religions. A note bearing on the subject I here quote: \"The godhead among the Mesopotamians was a quartette equivalent to the Hebrew Arba signifying four.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Inman the crux ansata is a symbol of the union of the sexes, and the Fleur de lys represents the male triad. I have just come across a picture of a Pope by Guercino engraved by Bartolozzi where the Pontiff is represented holding in his hand a book on which rest three spheres in a triangular arrangement. The picture bears no name and the date of work is not given.\n\nMr. Cockburn read the following note on torsion in the awns of Spear Grass, which he had contributed to the \"Asian.\"\n\n\"Enclosed are some spikes of a small species of spear grass, in which I observed a remarkable property of spontaneous movement. The subject is one of some economic importance, as this grass threatens to overrun the entire district, and is very difficult to eradicate. On the 16th March 1881, while camped at Ackbye (ten miles north east of Banda, N. W. P.), I had occasion to wash my hands, the water used saturating the ground. Looking down, I happened to observe some minute objects in motion, which I took for some form of animal life. I accordingly knelt down and examined them closely.\n\n\"I found that the objects were these grass seeds. As soon as the earth in the vicinity was moistened, they began to unravel themselves with a peculiar spiral motion, the effect of which was to bury the entire seed in the soil till only the extreme (filiform) tip remained visible. By this process, they became perfectly straight, and as they invariably went down point first perpendicularly, they not inappropriately resembled arrows when pulled out again.\n\n\"I tried a series of experiments within a radius of 200 yards of my tent, and found that the ground was simply alive with these seeds, and that they began their burrowing movements whenever the soil was moistened.\"\n\"The soil was mar (black cotton) in a partly pulverised condition on the surface. I shall be happy to furnish further particulars if the subject has not been observed before, and is of interest.\n\n\"Dr. King, the eminent botanist, was so kind as to reply to my letter and I take the liberty of quoting a portion of his letter:\n\n\"'Your observations are of much interest. The phenomenon of torsion in the appendages of seeds has been observed before, and an elaborate paper on the mechanism of the torsion in seeds by Mr. Francis Darwin appeared in the Linn\u00e6an Transactions in 1876. In that paper Mr. Darwin suggests that the use of torsion to a seed may be to enable it to bury itself in the soil. You have seen the seeds in the act of being buried, and it would be of much interest if you continued your observations.'\"\n\nThe following papers were read:\n1. *The Rise and Progress of Buddhism in Thibet.*\u2014By Sarat Chandra Das.\n2. *The Lives of the Tas'i Lamas.*\u2014By Sarat Chandra Das.\n   These papers will be published in full in the Journal, Pt.

Part I\n   The Scent-glands.\u2014By J. Wood-Mason.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe remarkable Arachnidan genus Thelyphonus is confined in its distribution to South America and Southern Asia and their islands. Of its internal anatomy nothing but the nervous system is known. The French zoologist Lucas states that the Thelyphoni are called Vinaigriers by the inhabitants of Martinique on account of the strong vinegary odour which they emit when touched or handled. Stoliczka, who examined living specimens of one of the Indian species, states that a peculiar but inodorous fluid issues from two internal pyloric (I) appendages. These Arachnides, according to Lucas, live in damp places under stones on the ground. Stoliczka and Mr. Peal found them beneath the bark of decayed trees in groups. The author of the present paper was only able to obtain specimens for dissection during the heaviest rain, when all vegetation and the ground is saturated with water, and the animals come forth from their holes in the rocks, and he had found that death quickly followed their removal from their humid haunts, air saturated with moisture being apparently necessary for the due performance of their respiratory functions. All the specimens he had met with emitted, when touched, a most powerful and lasting odour exactly like that of a highly concentrated essence of pears, but which when deeply inspired had all the characteristic smell and pungency of strong acetic acid. This odour did not emanate from the general surface of the body, but proceeded from a pellucid fluid which exudes from the neighbourhood of the anus and is secreted by special glands. These are paired\nand tubular organs of huge size, extending from the 19th somite of the body (on which they open by two minute valvular apertures placed at the sides of the anus) to the front end of the 13th in the male, but to the middle of the 11th in the female (whose glands are consequently the larger), and being, with the exception of the voluminous liver, the most conspicuous of the viscera. They are two subpellucid bags shaped somewhat like an Indian club, striped longitudinally with white, and filled to distension with a thin and clear fluid. They are not quite equal nor are they placed symmetrically in the body-cavity, but the one or the other lies between the nervous chain and the ventral body wall in the middle line between the two rows of vertical muscles, and the other between the row of muscles and the lateral wall of the side of the body to which it properly belongs. They apparently consist of a strong and structureless basement membrane invested externally by a layer of delicate striped muscular fibres arranged circularly and of an inner membrane; the walls of the short (1 mm. long) ducts are transversely thickened so as to resemble the tracheae of insects; the glandular tissue is arranged between the two membranes in longitudinal plaited stripes so as to permit of the expansion of the lumen of the tubular organ into a receptacle or bladder for the storing up for use of the secreted fluid, to which apparent arrangement of the glandular substance the striped appearance of the organs is due.\n\nThe secretion doubtless serves to protect the animals from attack, and it is interesting to find that the female in this, as in so many other animals which are similarly protected by their offensive odour, is, as being for obvious reasons the more important sex, more perfectly protected than the male by having, not indeed, so far as could be detected, a stronger and ranker, and therefore more disagreeable scent, as in many insects, but larger scent-secreting glands. Another point of interest brought out by this investigation is that the two glands exhibit a tendency to coalesce and form a single unpaired median organ, the two being always unequal and occasionally partially united and the one in the middle line invariably the larger.\n\nThese structures seem to belong rather to the category of excretory organs than to be highly developed skin-glands; and they are probably homologous with the silk-glands of other Arachnida and of Insects, with the green-gland of the Crayfish, and with the segmental organs of Worms and Peripatus.\n\n2. On the Structure of the 'Foot' in certain Terrestrial Gasteropoda.\u2014By J. Wood-Mason.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper the author describes the structure of the part of the foot called by German writers on Malacology the 'Fusssaum,' which, as no\ntechnical name for it appears to exist in the English language, he proposes to call the peripodium in allusion to its relation of position to the locomotor ventral surface or foot of the mollusks possessing it, but which he thinks may be homologous with the lateral folds (epipodia) of many marine mollusks (Haliotis, e.g.) Very frequently the peripodium is provided at its posterior extremity with a capacious pit, the capacity of which may be increased by the prolongation upwards of its anterior margin in the form of a horn, which not being specially sensitive is not a tentacle; often it is without this terminal pit; it is invariably richly ciliated throughout from the mouth on one side round to the mouth again on the other side dorsally; equally invariably is it limited off from the side of the body (and very frequently also from the muscular foot) by a peripheral groove, which deepens anteriorly. Its office is to assist in lubricating the foot, the pit when present receiving the effete lubricating fluid and throwing it off in gelatinous lumps.\n\nThe foot-gland, as is well known, pours out its abundant and constantly flowing secretion through an aperture which is situated below and a little behind the mouth into a hollow whence it naturally fall into the deep anterior end of the dorsal peripheral groove, whence again it is carried by the cilia with which the surface of the peripodium is beset (being distributed to the foot as it goes) to the terminal pit. In those forms in which this pit does not exist, the secretion that has subserved lubrication is merely left behind by the crawling mollusk.\n\nAs Pulmonata possessing a ciliated peripodium with and without a terminal pit were to be found in every quarter of the globe, and as it was in the highest degree improbable that so highly specialized a structure subserving such an important purpose in the animal economy as this evidently did had arisen independently many times in many different forms in many widely separated areas of the earth's surface, he considered that it had a higher taxonomic value than had hitherto been assigned to it, and he felt strongly inclined to distinguish those forms that possessed it and those that did not (or had lost it) from one another by calling them CRASPEDOPHORA and LIPOCRASPEDA respectively.\n\nOrder PULMONATA.\n\nSuborder STYLOMMATOPHORA.\n\nCRASPEDOPHORA.\n\nPeripodial pit present.\n\n| Arion. | Nanina. | Macroceras. |\n|--------|---------|-------------|\n| Geomalacus. | Microcystis. | Xesta. |\n| Dendrolimax. | Macrochlamys. | Rhysoa. |\n| Cryptosoma. | Situla. | Ventridens. |\nAustenia.

B.\n\nDr. Lewis observed that the occasional presence of nematoid organisms in the blood of various animals had long been ascertained, and that it would be known to some of the members that, about ten years ago, he had drawn attention to the fact that in India a somewhat similar condition was observable in man, and that this condition was associated with certain forms of grave disease. Since this period the literature of the subject had very rapidly increased and numerous confirmatory observations had been made in various parts of the world. Our knowledge of the haematozoa of lower animals had also been very greatly extended during the same period and of recent observations of this kind the most important which he knew of was one which had been made by Dr. Griffith Evans, the present head of the Veterinary Department in Madras, who, whilst making a post-mortem examination of a camel at Dera Ismail Khan, in October 1880, found that the blood of the animal swarmed with the brood of a nematoid parasite resembling the haematozoon found in man. Dr. Evans found, further, that the parental form existed in the lungs, the pulmonary arteries of which were plugged by tangled masses of the thread-like parasites. They were also found in the mesentery. A comparison of these haematozoa with those found in man shows that whereas the embryonal forms of both kinds are indistinguishable under the microscope, nevertheless the mature form as met with in the camel differs, both as to size and structure, from the only male and female specimen of the mature form met with in man which has hitherto been obtained in India, and so far as the speaker was aware this haematozoon of the camel differs from any hitherto described parasite. Should further enquiry confirm the supposition that the parasite is new to science he proposed that it should be called Filaria Evansi.\n\nDr. Lewis submitted mature specimens of the Filaria Evansi and of the Filaria sanguinis-hominis to the meeting, as well as samples of the microscopic embryos of both kinds; and furnished the following preliminary description of the mature haematozoon of the camel.\n\n**Filaria Evansi**, sp. nov.\n\nThe male measures from 3\" to 4\u00bd\" in length and from \u215b\" to \u00bc\" transversely at the widest part. At the oral end the width is about \u215b\" and about one-third of an inch lower down the width equals \u215b\". The tail tapers to a blunt point and is curled into two or three coils. There are two spicules; the longer measures \u215b\" and the shorter \u215b\". The cloaca is situated at \u215b\" from the end of the tail. The bursa is small and is characterised by four pairs of pre-anal and two pairs of post-anal papillae, with a fifth post-anal papilla close to the tip of the tail. The mouth does\nnot manifest any well marked lips. The \u0153sophagus is $\\frac{1}{2}$\" long by about $\\frac{3}{16}$\" wide; and the caecal commencement of the sperm tube may, in well prepared specimens, be detected lying near the junction of the \u0153sophagus and the intestine. The sperm tube measures about $\\frac{1}{8}$\" transversely, and the intestinal canal about $\\frac{1}{16}$\"\u2014both measurements being made towards the middle of the body of the worm.\n\nThe female is, speaking generally, about double the size of the male. It is from 6\" to 8\" long and from $\\frac{1}{8}$\" to $\\frac{1}{4}$\" across, at the widest part. The mouth is simple and somewhat pointed, the width of the parasite at this part averaging $\\frac{1}{32}$\". The tail is blunt\u2014terminating in a slightly clubbed or funnel shaped enlargement; its width at the extreme end averages $\\frac{1}{16}$\", but a little higher up its diameter is somewhat less\u2014$\\frac{1}{32}$\". The \u0153sophagus averages 3\" in length and $\\frac{1}{16}$\" in width, and the intestine about $\\frac{1}{16}$\". The anus terminates at a spot about $\\frac{1}{16}$\" from the caudal end. The genital orifice is about $\\frac{1}{16}$\" from the mouth. For about a quarter of an inch from the orifice the genital tube presents nearly the same diameter, viz., about $\\frac{1}{32}$\", and then it rapidly widens to $\\frac{1}{16}$\" and subdivides into two utero-ovarian tubules, each measuring $\\frac{1}{16}$\" transversely. The tubules are generally packed with embryos averaging $\\frac{1}{16}$\" in length by $\\frac{1}{32}$\" in width. Lower down, ova, in various stages of differentiation, and embryos are mixed together.\n\nThe specimens examined had been for a short time in spirit; they were of a yellowish-white appearance and female specimens more numerous than males. There was no marked difference as to firmness of texture between them. A fuller description of the minute anatomy of the parasites has been prepared and is nearly ready for publication.\n\n4.

Notes on the Singpho and Kampti country, North-Eastern Frontier.\u2014By Chas. H. Lepper, F. R. G. S., M. R. A. S. (vide Map.)\n\nGeneral Walker has desired me to write a short paper on the tract of country beyond our extreme North-Eastern Frontier, the tract between us and China, about which so little is known, in fact I may almost say about which nothing more is known than was brought to light by Wilcox more than fifty years ago. Even that indomitable and admirably correct explorer had to leave a strip of country between us and China totally unvisited and unreported upon. Having in those days to start from a point much further within our frontier than would be necessary now-a-days, he and his party were tired out and at the end of their energies and supplies before getting more than half-way between our present frontier and China, and felt obliged to return. Since his time we have got, literally speaking,\nno further in our knowledge of the country beyond our frontier. In the seventeenth century we had a factory at old Bhamo, a few miles to the east of present Bhamo, and it is only natural to suppose that the Europeans then residing at old Bhamo knew at least as much if not more of the country north and west of their settlement than we do now.\n\nFor many years I have been occupying my leisure by collecting all the information I could of this exceedingly interesting tract, and have frequently made little excursions across the frontier. But this last cold season I had the great good fortune of having as my companion a gentleman whose name from political reasons I am not permitted to mention, but whom you will immediately recognize under the initials A. D. Having in him all the information extant on the China side of this tract I was able to ask the people we met such questions as would tend towards obtaining correct information, as we thus had the means of checking some of the statements made us.\n\nTo take up the geographical points first, I will condense into as few words as possible the most important details we collected. We knew from Wilcox's account, which we had with us for reference, the country up to Manchi and the Nam Kin branch of the Irrawaddi. To fix this extreme point of our knowledge from the west, I had better state that Wilcox gives from \"several observations\" the latitude of Manchi (it should be spelt M\u00e1n Khi) as $27^\\circ 29' 16''5$: he does not give its longitude unfortunately. The latitude of Sadiya, our present outpost, is I believe given as $27^\\circ 49' 44''$ and longitude $95^\\circ 43' 6''$. We may take then M\u00e1n Khi as roughly speaking about $20'$ to the south and $2^\\circ$ to the east of Sadiya. On Wilcox's map of his trip is traced the upper portion of a river to the east of the Nam Kin and running for some distance almost parallel to the Nam Kin viz., north and south. He marks this the Nam Disang (nam = river in Kampti as in Siamese, sometimes menam): we heard it also called the Khan Kha (kha = river in Singpho) by the Singphos. This river was described to us from drawings on the sand as joining the Nam Kin by taking a somewhat sudden bend at no great distance below the entry of the Sit Kha into the Nam Kin. Between these two rivers, and north of the latitude of M\u00e1n Khi, live the Khannungs, a distinct people, very quiet, and rather skilful workers in metal: these are the makers of the best Kampti daos. Below these and still between the two rivers Nam Kin and Khan Kha or Nam Disang is the Dooling clan of Singphos, belonging to the Kaku division of Singphos.\n\nIn one of Wilson's maps, again, a trace of which I have, he shows a short trace of a river to the north east of M\u00e1n Khi and beyond the Khan Kha or Nam Disang. On another map published in 1828 by Wilcox I see he has, from hearsay or by guess, prolonged this little bit down till it joins\nthe Irrawaddi a little above the 25th parallel of latitude, and calls it the Shoomaee. In his letter-press he gives its different names as being Shumai Kha, Pongmai, or Simai Kha. I heard it called Phongmai by the Singphos, Nam Kin lung (big Nam Kin by the Kamptis) and in an old map published at the Surveyor General's Office I see it called the Seng Kha. Now this latter name is important, perhaps, as it bears a significant resemblance to the Song \"ga Kin of Thibet. The Song \"ga Kin in Thibet passes the village of Song \"ga kin Dzong, which is somewhere on or about 28\u00b030' of latitude, and runs in a direction which leads one again to suppose that the Song \"ga Kin and the Seng Kha are one, apart from the resemblance of name. Then again the Seng Kha or Phongmai, or Shumai or Sinma\u00ef, having been described to us as the Nam Kin lung, i.e., the big Nam Kin, points to its being bigger than the Nam Kin, at the same latitude as Man Khi, i.e., before the latter had received the waters of the Nam Lang, and Sit Kha, western tributaries, and the Khan Kha its eastern tributary. This would be quite consistent with its greater length and yet would be consistent with the statements of Major Sandeman's surveyor, who makes the eastern branch of the Irrawaddi above Maing na as smaller than the western, the western (i.e., Nam Kin) having before this latter point received the tributaries Nam Lang and Sit Kha, and Khan Kha or Nam Disang.\n\nDr. Clements Williams put the junction of the two Nam Kins (let me so call them to speak in one language at a time) at a place called Mainla about 26\u00b0 N. lat. This Mainla is evidently the Maing na of Major Sandeman's surveyor, which is given as 16 miles north of Kacho, and the latter place is given as latitude 25\u00b0 6'. His \"eastern branch\" must be the Nam Kin Lung, as we know it cannot enter the Irrawaddi lower down, as the surveyor must have noticed its mouth, and it cannot have passed across Capt. Gill's route without his having entered it, unless it could be either the Shu\u00e9 li, the Taping, or the Nampoung, which is not to be seriously considered.\n\nIf this reasoning be correct we must make the Khan Kha or Nam Disang join the Nam Kin shortly below the mouth of the Sit Kha, as there is no room for it much lower down, and this again quite agrees with the accounts I have brought back, and already stated above. The Nam Kin at about the latitude of Man Khi is not more than 80 yards wide and fordable even when swollen by the melting snows, according to Wilcox. The Khan Kha is said to be much the same size by the Singphos, but I have my doubts on that point.\n\nI think we can now accept the Nam Kin lung or Phongmai Kha as the real source-stream of the Irrawaddi; and if the Song \"ga Kin and Seng Kha are one, then the Song \"ga Kin and our Nam Kin lung or Phongmai are therefore one: in that case the Irrawaddi rises in Thibet above the 30\u00b0 of N. latitude, and I think we may claim this as a reasonable solution of the Irrawaddi problem.\nLet me next take up the people inhabiting this tract. Between these two important streams the Nam Kin and the Phongmai or Nam Kin lung, or may I say the Irrawaddi \"proper,\" and from their junction to about the latitude of the junction of the Sit Kha with the Nam Kin are the Laphais a Singpho clan, represented to me as being quiet people and \"zemindars,\" i.e., probably cultivators: they also extend east of the Irrawaddi \"proper\" to the mountains bordering quasi Chinese territory, i.e., to the country inhabited by the Latongs, also a Singpho clan, which from enquiries we are able to recognize as the Lissous of our best authority on the country on the Chinese side viz., A. D. We therefore meet China on known ground here.\n\nNorth of the Laphais and between the Nam Kin and the Irrawaddi \"proper\" are the \"Kumsangs another Singpho clan. These extend again east as far as the Latongs or Lissous. We meet China here again. North of the \"Kumsangs, and between the Nam Kin and Irrawaddi \"proper\" are the Murans, another Singpho clan, but these do not, it is said, pass the Irrawaddi \"proper\" to its east.\n\nThese Murans are interesting as being the parent stock of the Muran or Muttocks of the Lackimpur District of Assam, and are said to be a section of the Loosoo or Lissou clan of A. D., but this dates from 800 years ago. The word \"Muttuck\" signifies \"capable of resistance,\" and was given them by the Kamptis and Singphos in contradistinction to the other Assamese who were termed Mooools, and who were taken as slaves. The equivalents for \"Muttuck\" and \"Mooloon\" are given as \"sukut\" and \"nurum.\" They are now, these same Muttucks, probably the most effete and slothful people in existence.\n\nNorth of the Murans and still between the Nam Kin and the Irrawaddi \"proper,\" at the foot of the Himalayas and about the eastern source of the Khan Kha or Nam Disang, are the Maruv, a distinct tribe, who are described as a quiet inoffensive people. They must be a very small body judging from the space allowed them. They are said not to pass the Khan Kha or Nam Disang to the west, nor the Irrawaddi \"proper\" to the east.\n\nComing back to the country north of the \"Kumsangs, on the east bank of the Irrawaddi \"proper,\" we have the Mussu Tchi Keyt clan of Singphos, and east of these again the Dainu Tribe, a distinct people. These are on the western slope of the range of mountains bordering the Lutze Tribe of A. D. We therefore meet China again here. But between the Mussu Tchi Keyt clan and the Dainu Tribe in the Terai there is the Dgi Tribe and these extend north up into the Hills. Possibly these may be the Didju Tribe of A. D., as they are about where he places that tribe, though on this point I have only the similarity in name and situation to go upon.\nThus from the Thibetan Frontier in the north down to already described country in the south we have now been able to fill in the clans and tribes between our frontier and China, and of these it is satisfactory to learn that the majority are described as very quiet people, and those, viz., the Lissus, who are from native sources described as the worst, are described by A. D. as being well disposed to Europeans, though subject enough to disputes amongst themselves.\n\nIt is seen from the above what a very small area is allotted to the Kamptis of Bor Kampti visited by Wilcox over 50 years ago. They may be said to be contained in the basin between the Nam Lang and the Nam Kin, a few detached villages being found scattered along the river banks, a little to the north of Kacho, by Major Sandeman's surveyor.\n\nThe clan of Kamptis that was in power in Wilcox's time in Bor Kampti, viz. the Lung Kins, have been expelled by the other Kampti clan called Luk Khun, and their town Kallang of Wilcox's map destroyed. Of those that escaped of the Lung Kins some went south down the Nam Kin, others are settled along the Tenga Pani, and near the mouth of the Noa Dehing in our territory. This exodus occurred about 30 years ago. They left none of their clan behind them except the orphans of the slain that were too young to march. There are several kh\u00e9ls or small clans amongst the Kamptis. These Kamptis in our territory have still a greater respect for Burmah than for us, and imagine Burmah stronger than we are. I met two Burmese, I firmly believe officials, amongst them. They send presents to the Burmese kings, having to send them through British country to do so. The Kamptis of Bor Kampti also send presents as tribute once in about three years to Burmah.\n\nLooking at the Kamptis from a China route point of view they can be perfectly ignored by passing to the south and round them. In any case they would do nothing but offer passive resistance. But as, owing to the jealousies existing between the Kamptis and Singphos, it would be impolitic to have a mixed following of Kampti and Singpho guides, and as Kampti guides alone could not lead an explorer to China, and Singpho guides properly selected from the different Singpho clans could do so, it is easily seen of how little importance to us any kind of feeling towards us on the part of the Kamptis need be.\n\nThe Kampti language is undoubtedly a patois of Siamese as is easily detected by a glance at a comparative vocabulary. They use characters almost identical in general appearance with those of Burmah, but having a difference in value and pronunciation. As regards the Singpho language, this seems, after a comparison I have made with some 14 languages of these parts (vocabularies of which I have already collected, with hopes of adding some 14 to 16 more to their number), to be a distinct language. It is\ntrue I can find words quite similar and of the same meaning in several of the other frontier languages, but these few are so very rare out of a good number, that they can only be called coincidences, and they tend to make the differences all the more marked. There is one coincidence, however, of sufficient interest to mention, viz., the word for the numeral five; this in Singpho is mungar, in Munipuri is munga, in Kuki Lushai is punga, in Angami Naga is pengu.\n\nBoth the Kamptis and Singphos belong to the Thibeto-Burmah non-Aryan division.\n\nThere has possibly been too great a tendency to mark down new languages on this frontier amongst philologists, and from a letter I have just received from Mr. Sam. Peal I find he is of the same opinion as myself. I cannot do better than quote his letter which explains the case admirably in a few words; he says \"I may tell you at once, however, that there is no hard and fast boundary for the Naga dialects this side any more than for the Irish brogue at home; contiguous tribes (of Nagas) generally converse easily and it becomes more difficult with distance. The Philologists at home make this mistake. It is, however, not so much a dialectic variation as that actual words do change radically with the distance, the percentage increasing with it.\"\n\nOf course here we only speak of languages belonging to individual races, which languages are subject to much change in themselves, sufficient to give rise to the error of classing them as distinct patois or languages instead of as blended patois.\n\nThe Singpho language is perfectly distinct from the Kampti or as we might call it that Siamese patois spoken by the Kamptis.\n\nThis Singpho language is not purely monosyllabic though nearly so and has no tones \u00e0 la Chinoise so far as I have gone into it at present. The Kampti patois is on the other hand apparently monosyllabic and has got tones \u00e0 la Chinoise.\n\nThe Singphos were originally all one people, but some time back split up into two great divisions, say the Eastern and the Western, called Kakus and Ts'Sans. This localisation, viz. Eastern and Western, is only fit for general application, as families and villages of either may be, and are frequently, found situated amongst families and villages of the other. Both have representative villages within our frontier.\n\nThese divisions are subdivided into clans, and the clans into families, and the families again into villages, till the whole appears indeed a difficult problem to work out when an attempt is made to localize and distinguish them all. What adds to the confusion is that in Assamese they only use the word kh\u00e9l to describe both the clan and the family. Perhaps the most important clan of the Ts'San Division is the Ga Kieng (called by\ntravellers in Burmah Ka Kyungs, &c., &c.) This clan is also called Dapha, from its having originally been located on the Dapha pani, a tributary of the Dehing a tributary again of the Brahmaputra within our frontier. Ga Kieng signifies red, and they are supposed to have got this name from the red colour of the soil near the Dapha: probably the red sandstone rocks about there gave the name.\n\nThis clan is of course again divided into a lot of families and villages. The Kaku Division again claims several large clans such as the Laphais, Latangs or Lissous and Kumsangs, &c. The Kaku division is found chiefly in the trans Nam Kin country and the Ts'San division on this side of the Nam Kin, in the Hokong valley, and between the Irrawaddi and the Kandywen. A propos of the Lissous, although they actually pay tribute to China, i.e., those of them immediately adjacent to China, they are not allowed at Pekin to be in existence, nor their name to appear on the Chinese maps, but this is an interesting detail which it would take too long to relate here.\n\nThe Singphos pay tribute to nobody, neither to Burmah nor to China, thus forming a neutral ground between us and China. All these tracts, especially towards the south and south-west and those in the further west of our frontier station Sadiya, are extremely rich in the precious metals, and the amber mines of Hokong, only a few days' journey from our frontier, are famous. Serpentine, jade, salt and other valuable minerals, as well as precious stones, are found in these tracts in no insignificant quantities. The Chinese come a long way towards us, in the country just below the junction of the Nam Kin and the Irrawaddi \"proper,\" i.e., on the neutral ground referred to, for trading purposes, and there used to be large settlements of them even on this side of the Irrawaddi. This seems to point very distinctly to the easy opening of trade communications with China on this neutral ground, seeing that the Singphos would welcome us gladly if properly treated in the first instance.\n\nAs regards our actual distance from the Chinese frontier, if we put the extreme point of our further line at about 70 miles east of Sadiya, then we cannot be more than 80 miles from the limit where Chinese influence commences or their \"outer line\" must be, which latter follows the range of mountains on the right bank of the Saluen or Loutze Kiang (river of the Loutzes). This 80 miles contains more of interest in itself than is easily explained in a short paper of this nature, but time and space do not allow me to deal, but in a most general way, with a subject that might fill volumes before being exhausted.\n\nGeneral Walker remarked that, in the absence of actual survey operations, geographers had much reason to be indebted to gentlemen\u2014as Mr. Lepper, and our friend A. D. to whom we are already indebted for previous\ncommunications\u2014who, while residing in the neighbourhood of any region which has not yet been explored by Europeans and is still a terra incognita to the world at large, devote themselves to enquiries regarding its inhabitants, their actual subdivisions, and the general run of the rivers and mountain ranges which separate them from each other and from the outer world. In this way the broad facts of the geography of the country become elicited even without actual survey.\n\nThe information now furnished by Mr Lepper and A. D. regarding the Singphu Kampti country and the regions between eastern Assam and western China tends to strengthen the probabilities in favour of the sources of the Irrawaddy river lying wholly in a system of mountain ranges on or about the parallel of 28\u00b0. On the other hand we have already learnt from A. D. that the Salwin river\u2014which may be regarded as a sister to the Irrawaddy, the two flowing parallel to each other for a considerable distance, and eventually entering the same ocean\u2014takes its rise in the great plateau of eastern Thibet, probably about the parallel of 32\u00b0 and very considerably to the north of the sources of the Irrawaddy. This is a fact of considerable geographical importance, of which we might long have remained in ignorance but for these communications.\n\n6. On an abnormality in the horns of the Hog-deer, Hyelaphus porcinus, Zim, with a theory on the Evolution of Antlers in Ruminants.\u2014By John Cockburn.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe abnormality which was unilateral was described and attributed to reversion to an ancestor of both Rusinae and Elaphinae. The arguments for and against this decision were then discussed.\n\nMr. Cockburn alluded to Prof. Garrod's theory of development from a typical antler which might be described as a bifurcate beam with a brow antler at the basal portion.\n\nThe author regards this typical antler as already a complex organ, inasmuch as certain existing species of deer show a far more elementary type, Cervulus and Coassus rufus for example, the horns of the latter animal never proceeding beyond the condition of a simple spike.\n\nThe important fact that the antlers of all ruminants exhibit the elementary character of a simple spike in the first year's growth has caused the author to assume as a hypothesis that the development of the antlers of individual species of Cervinae is a recapitulation of the history of the development of antlers in the group. The details of the theory are then explained and Prof. Boyd Dawkin's latest researches alluded to.\nLibrary.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in February last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

Wood-Mason, Esq., seconded by H. B. Medlicott, Esq.\n\nThe Secretary reported that Dr. G. Bomford and Dr. E. W. Chambers had intimated their desire to withdraw from the Society.\nThe Council reported that Messrs. J. Westland and F. W. Peterson had completed their audit of the Society's Accounts and furnished a report. A vote of thanks was passed to the Auditors.\n\nThe Council recommended that the Society should subscribe Rs. 50 to the fund now being raised for a Memorial for Mr. L. Schwendler at the Zoological Gardens. The recommendation was approved.\n\nThe President said the Governor of Hongkong, whom he had brought to the meeting, possessed a very rare Chinese Bank note which he would be kind enough to show to the Society.\n\nSir Pope Hennessy, in laying the note upon the table, reminded the members that in the 2nd Book of Marco Polo's travels is a chapter entitled \"How the great Kaan causeth the bark of trees, made into something like paper, to pass for money over all his country.\"\n\nMarco Polo describes those bank notes as something resembling sheets of paper but black and of different sizes. He says they are made from the bark of the mulberry tree.\n\nFour hundred years after Marco Polo wrote, the accuracy of his work was questioned on this very ground, it being imagined that the Chinese could not possibly have had paper money at a time when paper money was unknown in Europe. None of the notes seen by Marco Polo in the thirteenth century appears to have been preserved, but a few notes of the fourteenth century are in existence, of which this is one.\n\nCol. Yule in his edition of Marco Polo says, \"I have never heard of the preservation of any note of the Mongols; but some of the Ming dynasty survive and are highly valued as curiosities in China. The late Sir George Staunton appears to have possessed one; Dr. Lockhart formerly had two, of which he gave one to Sir Harry Parkes, and retains the other. The paper is so dark as to explain Marco's description of it as black. By Dr. Lockhart's kindness I am enabled to give (says Col. Yule) a reduced representation of this note, as near a facsimile as we have been able to render it, but with some restoration, e.g., the seals of which in the original there is the barest indication remaining.\"\n\nA facsimile of the note exhibited to the Society has been made by the Lithographic Branch of the Surveyor General's Office and will be issued with the Proceedings for April.\n\nOn comparing the original with the engraving in Col. Yule's edition it was seen to be twice the length and breadth of the latter, of a darker shade and with some variation in the conventional ornamentation.\n\nThe Plate annexed is as close a facsimile as was possible under the circumstances. The upper line of Chinese characters on the bank note\nexhibited shows that it was printed in the Hung Woo period of the Ta Ming dynasty (A.D. 1368) so that it is about five hundred years old.\n\nCol. Yule was under a misapprehension in thinking Sir Harry Parkes was one of those who possessed a copy of these rare notes. Sir Thomas Wade the present British Minister in Peking, on being shown this note, also said it was the only one of the Ming dynasty he had ever seen.\n\nIn reply to questions asked by some of the members, Sir Pope Hennessy explained that the note was \"valued for one thousand,\" that is, 1000 cash, or one dollar. It bore the seals of the revenue officials, and appeared to be of Imperial currency as distinguished from the local or provincial paper money now used in some parts of China. The inscription on it denoted that any one convicted of forging the note would be punished by decapitation and any informer would receive a reward. This copy was got from the Chinese a few years ago by a European official of the Customs service who was well known as a collector of Chinese coins and old books, and on whose death in 1878 it was sold in Hongkong. His collection of Chinese coins was purchased by the Japanese Government. The note appeared to be printed from a block. The seals, of which a slight vermilion impression was visible, were similar to those now in use on official documents.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. *The Spirit-Levelling Operations executed in connection with the Tidal Observations of the Indian Survey Department.*\u2014By Lieut.-General J. T. Walker, C.B., F.R.S., Surveyor-General of India.\n\nThe tidal stations at Madras and Bombay have now been connected by a line of spirit-levels carried directly across the peninsula, for the most part in the vicinity of the line of railway. The mean-sea level has been determined very approximately at each of the two tidal stations, and it would appear from the spirit-levelling operations that the mean-sea level is about 3 feet higher at Madras than at Bombay. That there are variations in the general level of the surface of the ocean at different places, so that, if compared with the surface of the spheroid or other geometrical figure which most closely corresponds to the figure of the earth, the surface of the ocean will in some places be above and in other places below that of the figure, is probable enough; and indeed this must certainly happen, whenever the attractive influences of mountains and other irregularities of the earth's surface on the waters of the ocean are not counteracted by deficiencies of density in the strata below the elevated masses. But as the surface of the ocean is everywhere maintained in equilibrium, there can be no flow of water from one point to another; thus there can be no sensible differences of level, though some points on the surface may be materially\nhigher than other points, as referred to a hypothetical geometrical surface, or, say, to the earth's centre. The differences of height, however considerable, must be insensible, because they cannot be measured by instrumental means; for the causes by which they would be produced must equally affect both the spirit-levels of the instruments and the water-levels of the ocean, whenever both are subjected alike to the same influences. Thus if in the present instance the spirit-levels had been carried, without error, along the coast line, from Bombay round via Cape Comorin to Madras, they must have shown identity of mean-sea level at Bombay and Madras, just as has been met with in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean on opposite sides of the Isthmus of Suez, and in the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, on opposite sides of the Isthmus of Panama. And this identity would be obtained even if there were actually a considerable difference of height, as is very possible; for the Western Ghats, and the generally greater elevation of the western as compared with the eastern half of the peninsula, are sources of attraction which, if not counteracted, must raise the mean-sea level at Bombay no less than 31 feet (as computed by Mr. Hennessey) above the mean-sea level at Madras.\n\nThe spirit-levels, however, were taken across the continent and not along the coast-line; they were carried from Bombay up the short and abrupt ascent to the crest of the Western Ghats, and then down the long and gentle decline to the east coast. Thus, while subject to the same general attractive influence of the continental masses as the ocean levels, they are also subject to the more proximate influences of local irregularities in the configuration of the ground passed over. The closing discrepancy of 3 feet at Madras is materially greater\u2014both absolutely, and relatively to the distance levelled from Bombay\u2014than any error previously met in the course of the levelling operations of this survey, which have been carried over many thousand miles and tested at a number of closing points and junctions of circuits, and have been conducted with special precautions to guard against errors of all kinds, whether accidental or cumulative. Moreover, a very similar discrepancy, almost identical in sign and magnitude, is stated to have been met with at the close of the railway levels between Madras and Bombay. Thus it has been surmised that the discrepancy may be due to the proximate and local attractions of the hills and table-lands over which the lines of level were carried, and which must exercise some influence on the instrumental levels, over and beyond the general influence that is exerted alike on both the instrumental and the ocean levels. Problems of this nature have been investigated mathematically by Colonel A. R. Clarke, C. B., R. E., and formul\u00e6 for their calculation are given in his recent valuable treatise on Geodesy. Mr. Hennessey has calculated the attractions with these formul\u00e6, making such assump-\ntions as regards the general configuration of the ground levelled over as appeared to be most reasonable and probable; and he has arrived at the conclusion that the levelling operations cannot have been influenced by the proximate and local attractions experienced on the line of operation to anything like the amount of the discrepancy met with.\n\nThus the discrepancy is possibly due chiefly to error in the levelling operations. As the most probable locus of such error was believed to lie in the section over the Gh\u00e2ts, where the ascents were very steep and the staves were sometimes so close to the levelling instrument that the foot-marks could not be seen in the field of the telescope, that section was re-levelled; but the results of the two measurements were identical. And indeed it seems highly improbable that the discrepancy can be due to any accidental gross errors, seeing the special precautions which have been taken\u2014by the employment of independent operators and instruments, and the use of double-faced staves\u2014to guard against such errors.\n\nBut it has long been known that all spirit-levelling operations are liable to an accumulation of small errors which, though individually so minute as to be barely appreciable at any single station where the instrument is set up, have a tendency to be repeated at successive stations, and may therefore attain a considerable magnitude at the end of a long line of levels. In the operations of this Survey it is customary to guard, as much as possible, against such errors by various expedients,\u2014such as observing the back staff first at one station and the forward staff first at the next, alternating the direction of operation on successive days, or at least executing half the work of a field season in the direction of the terminus and the other half in that of the origin; invariably setting up the staves at equal distances from the instrument at every station; and tilting the instrument occasionally, to guard against the heating influence of the sun\u2014or the cooling influence of winds\u2014acting on one side more than another, and causing dislevelments which would be frequently repeated if not counteracted, and thus create an accumulation of error. There is, however, a liability to personal misapprehension in reading the bubble of the spirit-level which may tend to produce a considerable accumulation of error on lines of which the general direction is either towards the sun or opposite to the sun. Owing to the level being placed above the telescope, the observer gets a side view of the bubble, refracted obliquely through the thickness of the glass tube, which is not so sharply defined as the look-down view from above. The rim round the bubble, caused by the adhesion of the liquid to the sides of the tube, becomes so prominent that its extremities may be observed instead of those of the bubble. When light falls obliquely and not vertically on the instrument, and either end of the telescope is pointed towards the light, the outer-edge of the rim at the end\nof the bubble towards the light is more clearly defined than the inner, while at the opposite end of the bubble the inner-edge of the rim is more clearly defined than the outer. Consequently there is a tendency to assume the instrument to be level when in reality the end towards the light is depressed; and though this tendency would probably vary in magnitude with different observers, it is likely to affect all persons more or less. Obviously it is uninfluenced by reversing the direction of operation, though it disappears whenever the direction is at right angles to that of the light.\n\nThis personal error in reading the spirit-level and setting the instrument would obviously produce a maximum effect on lines of which the general direction is meridional, when the operations are carried on equally before and after noon; when carried on between sunrise and midday, as is more usual in this country, the direction of the line of maximum effect would be south-east by north-west. The result would be apparently to raise the southern stations relatively to the northern ones. Now this has been found to occur in a greater or less degree in all our lines of levels connecting tidal stations, and not only on the direct line from Bombay to Madras\u2014to the following extent in each instance:\n\n(1) From the mean sea level of the tidal station of Okha, at the entrance to the Gulf of Cutch, to that of Bombay, there is an apparent rise of '38 feet, length of line 580 miles.\n\n(2) From the mean sea level of Bombay to that of Karwar, there is an apparent rise of '93 feet; length of line 530 miles.\n\n(3) From the mean sea level of Karwar to that of Madras, there is an apparent rise of '92 feet; length of line 560 miles.\n\nThe apparent rise of 3 feet at Madras as compared with Bombay was generated on a line of 730 miles in length; it is thus materially greater in proportion to the length of line traversed than the discrepancies met with on the three other lines. But as all the discrepancies are in the same direction, and all agree in raising the southern points relatively to the northern, it appears possible that all the operations may have been influenced by oblique illumination of the bubbles of the spirit-levels. It is to be noted that Madras is meridionally 400 miles to the south of Bombay, and that an error of level adjustment amounting in arc to only $1''2$, and recurring with the same sign at only one-fourth of the stations at which the instruments were set up\u2014the operations being otherwise errorless\u2014would produce a discrepancy of the magnitude which has been met with.\n\nIt has been considered desirable to enter very fully into the matter of this discrepancy, because long lines of level so frequently close without any appreciable error that disappointment may naturally be felt at the occurrence of so large a discrepancy as this, and the re-levelling of the entire line may be considered desirable. But the weakest section has already been\nre-levelled and no error has been detected in it, and this would probably be also found to happen in all the other sections. It is to be remembered that to whatever extent the levels already taken may be influenced by variations of local attraction, or by oblique instrumental illumination, a second measurement over the same ground would be influenced to exactly the same extent by the first cause and somewhat similarly by the second, and therefore would probably close with a similar discrepancy.\n\nIn the general reduction of the spirit-levelling operations it will be assumed that the mean sea level, as determined at each tidal station, is the datum to which the spirit-levels should be referred in each instance. Any discrepancies which may be met with on closing a line at a tidal station will be dispersed over the line and treated as errors generated in the levelling operations.\n\n2.

I am sensible of the very incomplete and inefficient manner in which I have performed the duties of that office, but I need not assure you that this has not been the result of any indifference on my part to the interests of the Society but of unavoidable circumstances. It so happens that at the time when I am down in Calcutta, and should otherwise be able to preside at your meetings, I am prevented by the numerous engagements of the winter season from attending the Society's meetings as frequently as I should wish to do. I now resign the office to which you did me the honor to elect me, and it will fall to the Council to appoint some one to take my place as President for the remainder of the year.\nThe Hon'ble H. J. Reynolds said: Sir Ashley Eden,\u2014On behalf of the members who are here to-night\u2014and I am sure I may also speak for those who are absent\u2014I desire to express our regret at the approaching severance of your connection with the Society, and at the same time our satisfaction at your appointment by Her Majesty to the responsible post of a Member of the Council of India. We all feel, Sir, that that Presidential Chair, in which you have had so many illustrious predecessors, has seldom, if ever, been more worthily occupied than by the successful administrator whose name will long be memorable for much good work done for the progress and development of the Province of Bengal. In the name of the Asiatic Society, I beg to tender you the cordial good wishes of us all.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in March last.\n\nTransactions, Proceedings and Journals,\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBerlin.

Blanford had communicated for all the latest subscriptions.\n\nThe Council announced that the Council recommended that the following gentlemen should be elected Associate Members, and that they would be called upon at the next meeting of the Society:\n\nP. A. de Roepstorff, Esq., Assistant Superintendent, Port Blair, in recognition of his long continued and successful labours as a naturalist, in which the knowledge of the interesting fauna of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands has been so much extended, as well as of his contributions to the Ethnology of the Islands.\n\nHerbert G. Lee, Esq., of H. M. Consular Service in China, in amount of his services to Chinese scholarship, especially in translating Fa Hien, and one of the Bodh Gaya Chinese inscriptions.\n\nThe Council reported that they had elected the Hon. Mr. J. Reynolds as President in the place of Sir Ashley Eden who had resigned; Mr.\nH. F. Blanford as Vice-President in the place of Mr. H. J. Reynolds, and Mr. A. W.

Hoernle exhibited three Gupta Coins found near Mahanad, received from the Rev. K. S. Macdonald, and described them as follows:\n\nI. Kum\u0101ra Gupta.\n\nMuch like that described in Indian Antiquities, p. 884, class E, b. Obverse: standing figure of king; legend: Sri Mah\u0101d\u012bghir\u0101ja \u015br\u012b Kum\u0101ra Gupta; under the arm: Ku. Reverse: Seated female figure on lotus; legend, almost illegible: Sri Mahendra.\n\nII. Skanda Gupta.\n\nSomewhat like that described in Indian Antiquities, p. 386, class E, b. Obverse: standing figure of king; legend, under the arm, skanda; marginal legend worn away. Reverse: female figure seated on lotus; legend, scarcely legible: Sri Skanda Gupta (?). The legend under the arm might be Chandra; in which case the coin would be one of Chandra Gupta II.\n\nIII. Unknown.\n\nIn general appearance it much resembles the Gupta coins. Obverse: Walking elephant, mounted by two persons, viz., king on the neck, carrying ankus; behind him, on the back of the elephant, an attendant holding a state umbrella over the king, with long pennant attached to umbrella. Around the whole margin a long inscription in Gupta characters, most of which are half worn away. Reverse: Nude, bejewelled female figure standing to front, on a lotus, with halo round the head, right forearm upturned, holding some indistinguishable object, left hand placed on hip and holding apparently a lotus or cornucopia; round her shoulders and dependant on both sides a long scarf; by side of right foot of female figure, the conventional sign of a chetiya, placed on edge, i.e., with its base parallel to the leg of the figure; on left of figure, something resembling a conch-shell (or perhaps a bodhi-tree). A circle of dots round the margin. To left of figure a short, partly illegible, inscription in Gupta characters; only ja or perhaps r\u0101ja can be read. The outline of the female figure differs somewhat from that on the ordinary Gupta coins; it is shorter and stouter and resembles the corresponding figures on the later Indo-Scythian coins. Impressions\nof this coin have been sent to General Cunningham, whose identification, when received, will be communicated to the Society.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. *Rise and Progress of Buddhism in Mongolia.*\n   By Babu Sarat Chandra Dass.\n   This paper will be published in the Journal, Pt.

R. A. S., etc.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper consists of 64 songs and catches popularly sung in the Panjab, especially in Kangra and Chamba, treated from a philological point of view. The language of some of them is Hindi, but most of them are in the current village Panjabi of the day. The language of those from Kangra and Chamba does not differ in the main from that of the songs from the plains of the Panjab. Lieut. Temple has divided the songs into classes according to the following subjects: (1) Religion, (2) Religious Customs, (3) Love, (4) Marriage, (5) Home Customs, (6) Nursery Rhymes, (7) Localities, (8) Riddles and facetiae, and (9) Politics.\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I, for 1882.\n2. Essays on Bih\u00e1ri Declension and Conjugation.\n\nBy G. A. Grierson, B. C. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nHitherto only two dialects of the Bih\u00e1ri language have been thoroughly investigated and each of these in one special form. These two dialects are\u2014the Bhojp\u00far\u00ed as spoken near Benares, treated of by Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle in his \"Comparative Grammar of the Gaudian Languages\" and the Maithil\u00ed, the standard dialect of the centre of Mithila, investigated by Mr. G. A. Grierson in his \"Maithil\u00ed Grammar.\" The M\u00e1gdh\u00ed dialect has not been treated of in any form, but it is a very interesting subject for study as showing the stepping-stone between the somewhat archaic forms contained in standard Maithil\u00ed, and the more phonetically attrited forms found in Bhojp\u00far\u00ed.\n\nThe author's object in these essays is to bring to a common focus all the information which he has collected concerning the dialects of Bih\u00e1r. The dialects mainly treated of are the following:\n\nA. Bhojp\u00far\u00ed, spoken in Western Bih\u00e1r.\nB. M\u00e1gdh\u00ed, spoken in South Bih\u00e1r.\nC. Maithil\u00ed, spoken in North-East Bih\u00e1r.\n\nOf the last, there are two sub-dialects:\n(1.) North Maithil\u00ed of North Tirhut and Bhagalpur.\n(2.) South Maithil\u00ed of South Tirhut and North Munger.\n\nBesides these, the dialects of language border lands have been considered, viz.,\n(A.) The Baisw\u00e1ri of the Ram\u00e1yana of Tulsi D\u00e1s, which is the border dialect between Bih\u00e1ri (Bhojp\u00far\u00ed) and Hind\u00ed;\n(B.) The dialects of the border land between Bih\u00e1ri (Maithil\u00ed) and Bengali.\n\nThis paper will be published in Journal, Part I, for 1882.\n\n3. Notes on Buddhist Sculptures with reference to the handling of Celts and other weapons.\u2014By John Cockburn.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper gives a new interpretation of Pl. XXXII of Fergusson's 'Tree and Serpent Worship,' which is a representation of the 3rd bas-relief from the top on the inner face of the left hand pillar of the eastern gateway, Plate XIV. Mr. Fergusson explains the sculpture as representing a family of Dasyus following their usual avocations. Mr. Cockburn is of opinion that it is intended to represent the workshop of a Bronze Smith of the period, and shows how all the different figures are consistent with this explanation. In the plate there are two men on the right, who, both in Mr. Fergusson's and in Mr. Cockburn's interpretation, are taken\nto be cleaving wood with axes, the heads of the axes being tied on to the shafts with cross ligatures. Mr. Cockburn discusses the question why in an age of considerable mechanical ability the men of the bronze age did not cut their axes with a transverse hole through which the handle might pass. He concludes that this arose neither from a want of the requisite skill nor for want of a proper conception of the pattern, but simply from the fact that the eyeletted axe required a comparatively extravagant expenditure of metal, which, although not generally uncommon at the period indicated, would be so amongst the mixed aboriginal class, who were poor as a rule and possessed of the simplest implements procurable. To show that the people of this age were acquainted with the modern method of making the axe-head, Mr. Cockburn instances Plate XLIII, fig. 2, from the coping of the Bharhut stupa, where a hunter is represented bearing on his left shoulder an axe clearly of the eyeletted pattern, differing in no respect from the modern axe. The paper concludes with some remarks on the saw-like implement in Plate XXVI, fig. 6, of the Bharhut sculptures, and on the arrows of that period.\n\n---\n\n**Library.**\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in April last.\n\n---\n\n**Transactions, Proceedings and Journals,**\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

In the course of village inspection as an Opium officer during the season of 1880-81, which was a year of partial drought in the Banda District, Mr. Cockburn observed numerous wells literally choked with potsherds, the fragments of vessels that had either slipped from the line used for letting them down, &c., or which had broken by coming in contact with the sides of the well. Many of these wells only contained from 3 to 4 feet of water, and after a few hours' use a pile of potsherds became visible at the bottom at the portion of the margin corresponding to that most frequented at the mouth. He had often occasion to superintend the cleaning of these wells and had invariably found the pottery in fragments, sometimes in well defined layers.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. Folk-tales from the Upper Panjab.\u2014By Rev. Charles Swynnerton, M. R. A. S., Chaplain, Naushera.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper contains 30 short tales collected by the author from the peasantry of the Upper Panjab, and probably never hitherto printed. Most of the stories were told to the author at the little village of Ghazi on the Indus, thirty miles above Attock. This paper contains the shorter tales of the Series, consisting of fables and short stories, and is to be followed by another containing longer and more ambitious tales such as those in the \"Arabian Nights.\"\n\nThis paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2. Notes on the habits and instincts of some animals.\u2014By John Cockburn.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper describes the injuries inflicted on a cobra by a mungos, (Herpestes auropunctatus, Hodg.), which included the destruction of both fangs. The author proceeds to state his grounds for believing the destruction of the fangs to be a deliberate act of reason and not accidental.\n\nAn instance of the Crested serpent Eagle (Spilornis cheela, Lath.) destroying the maxillary bones of a snake is given, and the development of the specially protected tarse of Circaetus gallicus, Gm., speculated upon.\n\nThe author observes that it would be of much interest if from questions of this kind we could discover how animals acquire their experiences.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL.\n\nFOR AUGUST, 1882.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal was held on Wednesday, the 2nd of August, at 9-15 p.m.\n\nThe Hon'ble H. J. Reynolds, President, in the Chair.\n\nThe minutes of the last Meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe following presentations were announced:\n\n1.

Atkinson; (2) The Bombay National Mahomedan Association, by Shaik Hyder Cassim; (3) On a fossil species of Camptoceras, by Lieut.-Col. H. H. Godwin-Austen, F.R.S.\n\n6. Ten small coins from the Deputy Commissioner of Chhindwara.\n\nThe following gentlemen duly proposed and seconded at the last meeting were ballotted for and elected Ordinary Members:\n\n1. The Hon. Moulvie Mohammad Yusuf,\n2. Moulvie Serajul Islam, B.A., B.L.\n3. Raja Ram Narain Singh.\nThe following gentleman is a candidate for election:\nDr. A. Barclay, proposed by Major J. Waterhouse, seconded by Dr. H. W. M'Cann.\n\nThe Secretary read a letter from the Rev. K. S. Macdonald announcing that the Rev. Jagadiswar Bhattacharjya, the owner of the Mahanad coin referred to in the Proceedings for May and July, had been kind enough to present it to the Society. It appeared also that the Rev. J. D. Bhattacharjya had some years ago lent his coin to Mr. Long, who had sent it to General Cunningham for identification: so that it was the same coin as that of which General Cunningham had forwarded an impression, and was in consequence unique.\n\nDr. Hoernle exhibited a remarkable birch-bark Manuscript, found at Bakhsh\u00e1l\u00ed, in the Yusufzai District, in the Panjab, and made the following remarks:\n\n\"The MS. which I have the pleasure of showing to the Society this evening is a very remarkable one. It was found in a ruined enclosure, near Bakhsh\u00e1l\u00ed, a village of the Yusufzai District, in the Panjab, by a man who was digging for stones; and it was sent to me by the Panjab Government, in order to be carefully examined and photographed. With the kind assistance of Major Waterhouse I had photographs of four leaves prepared at the Surveyor General's Office; of which photographs I have also the pleasure of exhibiting a copy to-night. The MS. is written on leaves of birch-bark, which have become so dry by age as to be like tinder, and, unless very carefully handled, they crumble into pieces. Hence, unfortunately, by far the largest portion of the MS. was destroyed when the finder took it up; and even the small portion that now remains is in a very mutilated state. With much care and trouble I have succeeded in separating all the leaves, and have found that 66 of them still remain, of none of which, however, much more than one half is preserved. For the purpose of reading and photographing them, I fixed them between two panes of glass; and afterwards, for permanent preservation, I mounted each leaf separately between two pieces of 'talc.'\n\n\"The MS. is written in the so-called S\u00e1rad\u00e1 characters, which are still used in Kashmir, and which, as they occur on the coins of the Mahar\u00e1jas of Kashmir, are of a not inconsiderable age. Some of the forms, which very frequently occur in the MS., especially of vowels, very closely resemble the forms used in the \u00c1s\u00f3ka and early Gupta inscriptions. I have not observed those particular ancient forms in other MSS. written in the S\u00e1rad\u00e1 characters, e.g., in the Mah\u00e1rnava MS. published in the Cambridge Paleographic Series. Hence I am inclined to look on them as an evidence of great age in the Bakhsh\u00e1l\u00ed MS.; and as the West Indus Districts were\nearly lost to Hind\u00fa civilization through the Muhammadan conquests, during which it was a common practice to bury MSS. to save them from destruction, the Bakhsh\u00e1l\u00ed MS. may be referred to the 8th or 9th century A.D.\n\n\"I have looked over all the leaves of the MS. that remain, and have carefully read and transcribed about one-third. I have thus seen enough of the fragment to make sure that the whole of it treats of Arithmetic (including apparently Mensuration), though incidentally a few rules of Algebra are noticed. The latter refer to the solution of indeterminate problems (ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka). The arithmetical problems are of various sorts; e.g., on velocity, alligation, profit and loss, etc. I may give one or two examples: thus \"A and B run 5 and 9 yojanas a day respectively, and A is allowed a start of 7 days or 35 yojanas; when will A and B meet?\" Or, \"A and B earn 2\u00bd and 1\u00bd din\u00e1ras a day respectively; A makes a present of 10 din\u00e1ras to B; how soon will their possessions be equal?\" An example of an algebraical problem is: \"A certain quantity, whether 5 be added to it or 7 be subtracted from it, is a square; what is that quantity?\" The solution, given in this case, is 11; for $11 + 5 = 16$ or $4^2$, and $11 - 7 = 4$ or $2^2$. The fragment, however, evidently does not contain the whole of the treatise on Arithmetic; for many subjects, commonly treated in Hind\u00fa arithmetical works, do not appear to occur in it; and this is confirmed by the numbers of the rules (or s\u016btras, as they are called). The earliest numbered s\u016btra that I have noticed is the 9th, and from internal evidence I conclude,\u2014though the numbers are lost,\u2014that the 7th and 8th rules are also preserved. The latest number I have met is the 57th.\n\n\"The method observed in the treatment of the problems is as follows: first a rule is given, introduced by the word s\u016btra; next follow one, or more, examples, introduced by tad\u00e1, and stated both in words and in arithmetical notation; the latter is sometimes indicated by the term sth\u0101pana; next follows a solution in words, which is always called karana \"operation\"; and lastly comes the proof, generally expressed in notation, and called prat\u012by\u0101yana or prat\u012byaya. This method differs considerably from that used in other Hind\u00fa arithmetical treatises, e.g., in those of Bh\u0101skara and Brahmagupta. The latter also use different terms; instead of tad\u00e1, examples are called by them udde\u015ba or ud\u0101harana; instead of sth\u0101pana they have ny\u0101sa; karana and prat\u012by\u0101yana or prat\u012byaya are not used at all; The term s\u016btra they employ occasionally, but in most cases they say karana-s\u016btra; which latter term may contain a reference to a karana-work such as that in the Bakhsh\u00e1l\u00ed MS. There are, also, some differences in the method of notation as used in this MS. and as commonly established. Division is indicated by placing one quantity under another without a line\nbetween them; e.g., $\\frac{5}{8} (= \\frac{5}{8})$: multiplication, by placing one quantity beside the other; e.g., $\\frac{5}{8} \\times 32 (= \\frac{5}{8} \\times 32 = 20)$: addition, by writing $yu$ (abbreviated for $yuta$ \"added\") before or after the additive quantity and placing the latter either by the side of or below the other quantity; e.g., $11 \\frac{5}{8} yu$ or $11 yu 5 (= 11 + 5 = 16)$: subtraction, by writing the negative sign $+$ after the subtractive quantity and placing the latter beside or below the other quantity; e.g., $1 (= 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3})$, or $11 \\frac{7}{3} + (= 11 - \\frac{7}{3} = 4)$. This negative sign is the most remarkable difference between the Bakhsh\u00e1li MS. and the works of Bh\u00e1skara and others. The MS. uses a cross $+$ (exactly resembling our modern plus-sign), while the sign which is commonly used is a dot, placed above the quantity; e.g., $11 \\frac{7}{3} (= 11 - 7 = 4)$. I may add that the cipher is used (as in the L\u00edl\u00e1vati) to indicate an unknown quantity, the value of which is sought; e.g., $0 \\frac{5}{8} yu m\u00fa 0 \\frac{7}{11} + m\u00fa 0 \\frac{1}{11}$\n\n(for $\\frac{x}{1} + \\frac{5}{1} = \\frac{y^2}{1}$ and $\\frac{x}{1} - \\frac{7}{1} = \\frac{z^2}{1}$; here $x = 11$, $y = 4$, $z = 2$; $m\u00fa$ abbreviated for m\u00falada \"square.\") It is, however, also employed, in the usual way as the tenth figure of the decimal notation. A proportion is expressed thus: $1 \\frac{13}{6} | 30 | pha 65$ (for $1 : \\frac{13}{6} = 30 : 65$; $pha$ abbreviated for phalam). All these peculiarities of method, terminology and notation, differing as they do from those in common use since the time of Brahmagupta (about 628 A.D.) and \u0100ryabha\u1e6da (about 500 A.D.), whose mathematical treatises are the earliest known, tend to show that the work contained in the Bakhsh\u00e1li MS. is more ancient than any of those I have just mentioned.\n\n\"There is another remarkable feature in the MS., which points in the same direction, namely, the language in which it is written. This is what is now commonly called the G\u00e1th\u00e1 dialect, because it was first noticed in ancient Buddhist works (such as the Lalita Vistara) written in verses or g\u00e1th\u00e1s. The term, G\u00e1th\u00e1 dialect, however, is no more appropriate now, because that dialect is now known to be also used in ancient Buddhist works, which are partly written in prose, such as the Mah\u00e1vastu, of which M. Senart has just published an excellent edition. However, that may be, it is generally admitted that this species of language is a very ancient one. It is a kind of ungrammatical Sanskrit, (judged, that is, by the standard of what is commonly called Sanskrit), interspersed to a large extent with ancient Pr\u00e1krit or P\u00e1li forms. There is some dispute as to the exact origin, time and locality of this species of ancient irregu-\nlar Sanskrit. But in all probability it was current in the early centuries just before and after the commencement of the Christian era, as a literary or cultivated form of the ancient Vernacular Pr\u00e1krit of North Western India, in the countries to the east and west of the Indus, till it came to be superseded by the classical Paninian Sanskrit. It is this language which is employed in the Bakhsh\u00e1li MS. It would be out of place here to enter into philological details; but I may mention that the language of the MS. is marked by all the peculiarities in orthography, etymology, syntax, etc., of the so-called G\u00e1th\u00e1 dialect. The evidence of the language, then, would tend to show that the work contained in the Bakhsh\u00e1li MS. must be ascribed, in all probability, to the earliest centuries of the Christian era, and further, since the G\u00e1th\u00e1 dialect has hitherto only been met with in Buddhist literature, to a member of the Buddhist community. If the latter supposition be correct, we should have in this MS. the first Buddhist Arithmetical work which, so far as I am aware, has hitherto become known.\n\nThere are, further, some specific points in the work contained in the Bakhsh\u00e1li MS. which tend to point to a peculiar connection between it and the mathematical portion of the Brahma Sphu\u1e6da Siddh\u00e1nta, the famous astronomical work of Brahmagupta, which was compiled in 628 A.D. Thus an algebraical rule in the MS. occurs in strikingly similar language in Brahmagupta's algebra; again the foreign terms d\u00edn\u00e1ra (Latin denarius) and dramma (Greek drachme) occur in both, etc. The mathematical treatise in the Bakhsh\u00e1li MS is undoubtedly older than that of Brahmagupta; but what the exact connection between the two works may be, I am not as yet in a position to say. From the language, as already remarked, it would seem to follow that the Bakhsh\u00e1li MS. contains a Buddhist treatise on arithmetic. All these are points which require further investigation, in which I am still engaged, and the results of which I hope to have a future opportunity of communicating to the Society. My present remarks are not intended to be more than a preliminary notice of the MS. In conclusion I will only repeat that the questions of the age of the MS. and of the work contained in it are entirely distinct; and that the date of the work is certainly very much earlier than the MS. copy of which a fragment has been found.\n\nDr. Hoernle exhibited a number of coins and clay figures, found at Toomluk and forwarded for inspection by R. H. Wilson, Esq., Collector of Midnapur. Amongst them there was a gold coin about which the subdivisional officer of Toomluk sends the following account:\n\n\"This coin was accidentally discovered in a pit five feet below the surface of the ground at the village of Shaurpur in thana Dehra. The place\nof discovery was formerly the bed of the Cossye river: close to it is a tank at the excavation of which wrecks of a boat were found at a great depth from the surface of the ground, thus clearly indicating that the Cossye overflowed over the site of the tank. The pit itself was originally dug for the making of bricks: afterwards the villagers used to take the fine sandy earth from the pit for plastering houses. Dinabandhoo Mitter caught sight one morning of a glittering substance attached to the side of the pit. He took it out and, examining, it found it to be a gold coin. He fancied it to be a Ramahundri mohur (a gold coin of the reign of Rama) and regularly worshipped it. The coin was discovered about the time of the Dussera in the Bengali year 1275. It came to the notice of the undersigned in March last and Dinabandhoo was disabused of his belief that it was a mohur of the reign of Rama. It is clearly a Greek coin.\"\n\nWith regard to the last statement, Dr. Hoernle remarked that it was a mistake. The coin is not a Greek, but a Gupta coin of Kum\u00e1ra Gupta.\n\nObv. King on horseback. Legend, partially legible only: round the head of horse apparently Kshatrapati; under its legs: Vijaya Kum\u00e1ra.\n\nRev. Nude, bejewelled female, sitting on \"m\u00f3r\u00fa\" and feeding pea-cock: Legend, Ajita Mahendra.\n\nSimilar coins are figured and described in Prinsep's Indian Antiquities; see p. 385, (Vol. I), Plate XXX, No. 3.\n\nOf the other coins, one is of silver and is a specimen of the early Hind\u00fa punch-marked coins: see Indian Antiquities, Vol. I, p. 211; and Plate XX, Nos 26-29. The marks are probably Buddhist, the wheel and swastika being recognizable.\n\nThe rest which are of copper are all Buddhist, bearing distinct Buddhist symbols. Among them there are some similar to those found at Behat; see Indian Antiquities, Vol. I, p. 82 ff, p. 209 ff, Plates IV, No. 8, and XX, No. 39.\n\nObv. Full figure of elephant, referring to the story of Buddha's conception.\n\nRev. Conventional figure of chetiya.\n\nOthers are somewhat similar to the coins figured in Indian Antiquities, Plate XX, Nos. 50, 51.\n\nObv. Elephant within Buddhist rails; over him ornamental svastika.\n\nRev. Lion (representing Buddha as S\u00e1kya Simha); in front bodhi tree; over him, common svastika.\n\nThere is another to which there is none in the Indian Antiquities exactly like; but cf. Plate XX, Nos. 37, 48,\n\nObv. Elephant.\n\nRev. Stag or deer; one of the commonest j\u00e1takas of Buddha.\n\nOthers, again, are like the coins figured and described in Indian Antiquities, Pl.

Bodhi tree; cross; chetiy\u0101 and triratna.\n\nAmong these, there are some which differ in the relative position of the symbols with regard to the two sides.\n\nObv. Elephant, over Buddhist rails, fronting Buddhist toran; over him svastika and chetiy\u0101.\n\nRev. Various Buddhist symbols: bodhi tree, svastika, chetiy\u0101.\n\nOr: Obv. Elephant, fronting Buddhist toran (above) and svastika (below); over him cross.\n\nRev.: bodhi tree, Chetiy\u0101, triratna, toran.\n\nThese coins were not struck, but cast, as shown by their shape, which still shows marks of the mould.\n\nThere are also five early Hind\u016b punch-marked coins; but the marks are indistinguishable; one is square; the others round. See the specimens in Indian Antiquities, Vol. I, Plate XX.\n\nLastly there is one copper Indo-Scythian Kanerki, like those figured and described in Indian Antiquities, Vol. V, Pl. VI, 90, Pl. XXI.\n\nObv. Standing figure of king Kanerki; just distinguishable.\n\nRev. Indistinguishable.\n\nThere is also one brass Chinese coin of the Manchu Tartars. See Marsden's Numismata Orientalia, p. 829, No. MCCCXIX; and Plate LVI, Nos. MCCXCIX and MCCCXIX.\n\nDr. Hoernle read the following letter from General Cunningham regarding the gold Gupta coin:\n\n\"I have compared your coin of Kum\u0101ra Gupta with three specimens in my possession, and I make out the following:\n\n? bhupati r\u0101jati Vijaya Kum\u0101ra Gupta,\n\nthe pt being tp. On the reverse the legend is simply\n\nAjita Mahendra.\n\n\"We have Horseman coins of Chandra Gupta with the reverse title of Ajita Vikrama. Now we know that Chandra Gupta bore the title of Sri Vikrama. I infer therefore that, as Kum\u0101ra Gupta certainly bore the title of Mahendra (see his silver coins Sri Kum\u0101ra Gupta Mahendrasya), the gold coins with the title of Ajita Mahendra must certainly belong to him. The present gold coins with the Horseman obverse, and the goddess Kum\u0101ra Devi on the reverse, confirm this attribution as they give the name of Kum\u0101ra Gupta under the horse quite distinctly.\"\n\n\"The gold coins of the Guptas require to be carefully re-examined. I have several unpublished specimens some of which certainly belong to the later Gupta dynasty, which ruled from about 500 to 750 A.D. I return the coin of Kum\u0101ra Gupta enclosed.\"\nDr. Hoernle remarked, that what General Cunningham read [gu]pta bh\u016bpati, he had read as kshatrapati or kshitipati; but he admitted that the letters were sufficiently worn to admit of various interpretations. Immediately preceding the word which he read as kshitipati, there were three letters the last of which was distinctly ja, and the whole of which he was inclined to read as Sri r\u0101ja, so that the whole legend would run: Sri r\u0101ja kshitipati r\u0101jati Vijaya Kum\u0101ra. After Kum\u0101ra there might have been the word Gupta, as the rim of the coin at that place was very much worn; but no trace of its letters remained.\n\nWith regard to the figures Dr. Hoernle read the following note by Dr. R. Mitra:\n\n\"As regards the terracotta figures the only one of interest is the female head with a profusion of ornaments. The ornaments are the counterparts of what we see on the Sanchi, Bharat and Buddha Gaya gateways, but quite unlike more recent sculptures. I am disposed therefore to assign a Buddhist origin and very early date (about the first three or four centuries of the Christian era) to the relics.\"\n\nDr. Hoernle exhibited 10 silver coins, presented to the Society by J. W. Tawney, Esq., Deputy Commissioner of Chhindwara. He remarked that the coins were of a well-known kind, and were variously called \"S\u0101ha\" or \"Sur\u0101shastra\" or \"Satrap\" coins. Similar coins (sent by Mr. Rivett-Carnac for inspection) have been before the Society not long ago, when they were described by Dr. R. Mitra. It would suffice therefore, this time, merely to state the names of the rulers to whom the present coins must be ascribed, and to refer to Prinsep's Indian Antiquities and E. Thomas's Dissertation in the Archaeological Survey of Western India (pp. 44 ff,) where they will be found fully described and figured.\n\nNo. I are three coins of Rudra Sena the son of Virad\u0101ma; see Indian Antiquities, Vol. II, p. 85, fig. 5. Two of them show faint numerals which General Cunningham reads as 137.\n\nNo. II are three coins of Atrid\u0101ma, the son of Rudra Sena; see ibid., fig. 8.\n\nNo. III is a coin of D\u0101ma J\u0101ta Sri, the son of Rudra Sena. So the name is read by General Cunningham who says that these coins are rare. They are not noticed in the Indian Antiquities.\n\nNo. IV is a coin of Vi\u015bva S\u0101h, the son of Atrid\u0101ma; see ibid., fig. 9.\n\nNo. V is a coin of Vijaya S\u0101h, the son of D\u0101ma S\u0101h. See ibid., fig. 3.\n\nNo. VI is a coin the names on which are illegible.\n\nDr. Hoernle exhibited three clay-seals, which had been found at Sunat and sent by Carr Stephen, Esq., and read the following note on them by Dr. R. Mitra:\n\"The seals I read\u2014\nNo. 1. Srissama Guptasya.\nNo. 2. Rati mutta.\nNo. 3. Tega sinha.\n\nThe first is your reading. I explain the double s by splitting the words thus: Sri auspicious epithet, Ts-sama equal (sama) to the Lord (Ts).\n\nThe second means \"he who has got rid of concupiscence,\" from rati \"concupiscence,\" and mukta, \"free from.\"\n\nIn the third the nasal is not an anusvara, but the nasal of the first group of letters.\"\n\nMr. Cockburn brought before the Society an interesting case of Polydactylism in a horse, observed by him in the streets of Calcutta.\n\n\"The animal was a black pony about 11 hands high, with a second toe developed on each fore leg. The inner metacarpal of the manus, corresponding to digit number 2 of the typical mammalian five-fingered hand, bore a long supernumerary hoof, which must have interfered to some extent with the animal's movements. He had ascertained by digital examination that the supernumerary digits were composed of the usual number of bones, viz., a proximal median and distal phalanx, and that the articulations possessed a certain amount of mobility. The hind limbs did not show any external indications of abnormal development. Unfortunately he could only make a very hurried examination, and has not been able to trace the animal since.\n\nPolydactylism in the horse would not appear to be of common occurrence in India. Mr. Wood-Mason had previously recorded an instance in the Proceedings of the Society for January 1871, (page 18, plate I,) and the preparation described by him formed one of the most interesting objects in the Mammal Gallery of the Indian Museum. The development of the existing Equines which are monodactyle out of polydactyle Hippotheroid ancestors is now as widely known as the Darwinian theory itself, and affords an excellent popular illustration of that theory. The researches of Professor Marsh in America had thrown much light on the subject. The extinct polydactyle Hippotheroids alluded to were Orohippus, Meohippus, Anchitherium and Hipparion, which formed a perfect gradation from a four toed to a single toed horse.\"\n\nMr. Wood-Mason remarked that this was a kind of monstrosity of which many instances had been brought forward, and the significance of which had been many years ago pointed out by himself, and since very fully explained by Professors Huxley and Marsh in connection with their researches in the Natural History of extinct Horses; and that the present\ninstance of it was well worthy of being briefly recorded in the Proceedings, although no anatomical examination had been possible.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. On new and little-known Mantodea.\u2014By J. Wood-Mason.\n\nThis paper contains descriptions of the following new species: Choradodis brunneri, Tarachodes insidiator, Tarachodes dissimulator, Gonypeta autham\u00e9n, Hierodula (Sphodromantis) arabica, Hierodula (Sphodromantis) muta, Hierodula sternosticta, Mantis callifera, Iris orientalis, and Polyspilota insignis. Other species described are the following: Amorphoscelis annulicornis, Eremophila arabica, Didymocorypha ensifera, Episcopus chalybeus, Dysaules longicollis, Euchomena thoracica, Hierodula (Sphodropoda) quinquedens, Hierodula (Sphodromantis) bicearinata, Hierodula (Rhombodera) atricoxia, var. grandis, Hierodula (Rhombodera) flava, Hierodula (Rhombodera) basalis, Mesopteryx alata, and Mesopteryx platycephala.\n\n2. Note on the Pali Grammarian Kachch\u00e1yana.\u2014By Lieut.-Col. G. E. Fryer, M. S. C., Burma Commission.\n\nThe Pali referred to in this paper is the language in which the sacred literature of the Buddhists of Burma and Ceylon is written.* It is found inscribed on palm leaves in the characters of the vernacular speech peculiar to those countries. M\u00e1gadha-bh\u00e1s\u00e1, or M\u00e1gadh\u00ed, is the appellation given to it by the native writers, who assert it to be the original language, as will be seen from the subjoined stanza from R\u00fapasiddhi, II, 1, the authorship of which has hitherto been unknown:\n\ns\u00e1 m\u00e1gadha-m\u00fala-bh\u00e1s\u00e1 nar\u00e1 y\u00e1y' \u00e1dikappik\u00e1\nbrahm\u00e1no ch' assut\u00e1l\u00e1p\u00e1 sambuddh\u00e1 ch\u00e1pi bh\u00e1sare\n\nwhich may be rendered thus\u2014\"that by which men of former ages, Brahmans, and such as had never heard speech, expressed themselves, is the original M\u00e1gadha language.\"\n\nWith regard to the question what this Pali is, I cannot do better than refer to the remarks of that distinguished orientalist Dr. Muir, on the Pali, its early introduction into Ceylon, and its relations to Sanskrit and Prakrit, in the 2nd Volume of his Sanskrit texts, pp. 56-73, 104, 108, 109 (second edition).\n\nThe use of the e for o, peculiar to the dialect employed in the pillar inscriptions which resembles the M\u00e1gadh\u00ed of Dhauli, is common to the Pali; for, in the 85th aphorism of chapter XX of the Sadda Niti, mention is made of this peculiarity: thus, ti-lingato th\u00e1ne si-yonam e, \"in the three genders e instead of si, yo,\" i.e., in the nom. sing., and nom. acc. plural; as,\n\n* The word pali signifies a line or row: a sacred text.\nvanappagumbe for vanappagumbo, 'the forest shrub,'\nsukhe dukkhe for sukham dukkham, 'health and sickness,'\nviratte kosiy\u00e1yane for viratt\u00e1 kosiy\u00e1yani, 'the impassible kosiya-brahminess.'\n\n[cf. Clough's Gr., p. 15. Cowell, p. 180, aphorisms 10-13, chap. XI, Var.]\n\nI think it may be affirmed that the P\u00e1li of Ceylon and Burma is the language Buddha used in M\u00e1gadha; but, from having been arrested in its downward course, and preserved from the prevailing corrupting influences of vernacular use, it differs from the modern M\u00e1gadh\u00ed, and from the dialect employed in the pillar inscriptions which resembles the M\u00e1gadh\u00ed of Dhauli.\n\nThere are extant in Burma and Ceylon several grammatical treatises upon the P\u00e1li language, which may be said to represent two different schools. The one is represented by the grammar of Kachch\u00e1yana; the other by the grammar of Moggall\u00e1na.\n\nMoggall\u00e1na, the representative of the more modern schools, flourished in Ceylon during the reign of Pr\u00e1t\u00e1rama B\u00e1hu I, circa 1158-1186 A.D. He was also the author of a P\u00e1li dictionary, or rather vocabulary, entitled the Abhidh\u00e1na, after the model of the Sanskrit Amarak\u00f3sa. On entering the priesthood, he dropped his patronymic, and assumed the name of Sangharakkhita Thera, 'The Protected of the Congregation,' under which title he wrote four treatises, the first two of which are in verse:\u2014viz,\n\nSubodhal\u00e1nk\u00e1ra, 'Easy rhetoric,'\nVuttedaya, 'Exposition of Metre,'\nSambandhachint\u00e1, 'Reflections on relation (of cases),'*\nKhuddasikkh\u00e1 t\u00edk\u00e1, 'a gloss in prose on Dhammasiri's \"Minor duties (of a priest).\"'*\n\nHe dedicates the last of these to the learned priest S\u00e1riputta, and the second to S\u00edla Thera. They probably represent one and the same person. The treatises on Rhetoric and Metre are merely adaptations from Sanskrit works on the same subject, viz., S\u00e1hitya-Darpana and Vrittaratn\u00e1kara, and his grammar exhibits similar indications of having been formed upon a Sanskrit model.\n\nThere are several points of difference, both in substance and arrangement, between this grammar and Kachch\u00e1yana's work; for instance, Moggall\u00e1na affirms that there are ten and not eight vowels in the P\u00e1li alphabet, thus increasing the number of the letters from forty-one to forty-three. Again, the book on case relation (k\u00e1raka) is excluded from the grammar, and made the subject of a separate treatise. The grammar contains 1,043 aphorisms arranged under seven books as follows:\u2014\n| Name of Book | Subject                  | No. of Aphorisms |\n|--------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| 1 Sandhi     | euphonic combination    | 58               |\n| 2 Sy\u00e1di 1    | words simple             | 243              |\n| 3 Sy\u00e1di 2    | and compound             | 115              |\n| 4 N\u00e1di       | secondary affixes (taddhita) | 142          |\n| 5 Kh\u00e1di      | primary affixes (kita)   | 179              |\n| 6 Ty\u00e1di      | verbs                    | 78               |\n| 7 Nv\u00e1di      | affix of nu, etc.        | 228              |\n|              | Total,                   | 1043             |\n\nThe same writer has left behind a large commentary on this work. \u0100nanda, otherwise called Piyadas\u00ed, a pupil of Moggall\u00e1na, has produced an abridgment of his master's work called Padas\u00e1dhana, which he dedicates to Moggall\u00e1na under his priestly titles of Sangharakkhita Thera, and Medhank\u00e1ra of Udumbaragiri, (the glomorous fig tree hill).\n\nThe other and somewhat older school is represented by the grammar ascribed to S\u0101riputta Mah\u00e1 Kachch\u00e1yana. It is called in Burma the eight-book-grammar of Mah\u00e1 Kissi, and contains 675 aphorisms. In his 'Kacc\u00e1yan\u00e6 Specimen,' [Halle, 1869,] M. Kuhn inserts, between the 13th and 14th aphorisms in the third (K\u00e1raka) book, an additional one, and the Ny\u00e1sa introduces into the K\u00e1raka book four others, all of which are represented in the K\u00e1raka book of the K\u00e1tantra, though none of them appear in Kachch\u00e1yana, nor in any commentary upon it. The 675 aphorisms are thus arranged under eight books:\n\n| Name of Book | Subject                  | No. of Aphorisms |\n|--------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| 1 Sandhi     | euphonic combination    | 51               |\n| 2 N\u00e1ma       | nouns                    | 221              |\n| 3 K\u00e1raka     | case-relation            | 45               |\n| 4 Sam\u00e1ss     | compound words           | 28               |\n| 5 Taddhita   | secondary affixes        | 62               |\n| 6 Akhy\u00e1ta    | verbs                    | 118              |\n| 7 Kita       | primary affixes          | 100              |\n| 8 Un\u00e1di      | Un affixes, etc.         | 50               |\n|              | Total,                   | 675              |\nAccording to native tradition, Kachch\u00e1yana, also called S\u00e1riputta,* pursuant to the declaration of Buddha that 'sense is represented by letters,' proceeded with Buddha's permission to Himavanta, and there composed this grammar,\u2020 which, from this reputed origin, is considered sacred. It is to be found in every monastery in Burma. The arrangement of the work is irregular. The aphorisms follow each other without any regard to system. As in Sanskrit grammars, the rules are given in the form of concise aphorisms or sentences hanging together like threads (uttas): the right understanding of which chain of rules depends upon a knowledge of the adhik\u00e1ra, or heading rule, and its influence on those that follow; thus Kachch. N\u00e1m. 2. 12. itthipumanopumasa-sankhyam, '(the rules about to follow relate to) nouns of number (and are alike applicable to the three genders) masc., fem., neut.' is a heading rule, which is said to exercise an authority over other aphorisms, inasmuch as these heading rules consist of terms which other aphorisms, in order to complete their sense, are under the necessity of borrowing. They are said to be of three kinds, namely, s\u00e1hagatika 'lion's gait' (applied to the habit of constantly pausing and looking back, pabhavapavilokanato); ma\u00f1j\u00fakagatika 'frog's leap' (the passing over, or skipping of, several aphorisms and supplying from a previous aphorism); yath\u00e1napubbika 'in regular or successive order.' As brevity is regarded as a primary requisite, the following abbreviations are resorted to in the aphorisms. A word in the genitive case is generally governed by th\u00e1ne understood (i.e., instead of such a word or letter another is to be used); a word in the ablative by paran (i.e., after such a word or letter, etc.); a word in the instrumental by saha (i.e., together with such, etc.); a word in the locative by pare understood (i.e., when such a word or letter follows, the rule refers to that which immediately precedes it); [cf. Cowell, pp. xvii\u2014xviii]. V\u00e1 signifies 'option,' of which there are two kinds; namely, vikappa, the allowing a rule to be observed or not at pleasure, optionally enforced: and vavatthita-vibh\u00e1s\u00e1, a fixed option, or one applicable throughout, the prescribed operation being in the one case carried out throughout, and in the other omitted throughout.\n\nThere are several commentaries on Kachch\u00e1yana's work, of which the most important are, the Ny\u00e1sa or Mukhamattad\u00edpan\u00ed, by Vimalabuddhi, an enlarged counterpart of Kachch\u00e1yana, but with five additional aphorisms in the 3rd (or k\u00e1raka) book, which are to be found in the K\u00e1tantra; the\n\n* So called in a Talain work called M\u00falam\u00fale In the commentary on the R\u00fapasiddhi, Buddha is said to have selected S\u00e1riputta Kachch\u00e1yana to elaborate the rules of grammar propounded by him. (Mah\u00e1. xxvii)\n\n\u2020 Suttaniddesa by Chappada saddhammajoti-p\u00e1la at Pugan in A.D. 1279 during the reign of king Kyau-taw\u00e1.\nR\u00fapasiddhi, by D\u00edpankara, otherwise called Buddhapiya, a clear and well arranged digest of the grammar in seven books, the last two books of the grammar being joined into one; the B\u00e1l\u00e1vat\u00e1ra by Dhammakitti, a compendium also in seven books, of which the third (or k\u00e1raka) book is placed last, and divided into two chapters; lastly, the Saddaniti, a prolix and bulky volume containing twenty-five books, divided into four parts (m\u00e1l\u00e1),\u2014linga m., dh\u00e1tu m., vuddhi m., and sutta m.; the aphorisms are styled lakkha\u1e47a (rules). It is a comparatively modern work, having been composed by Aggavamsa Thera at Pugan during the reign of king Kyautswa, A. D. 1279\u20141298.\n\nIt has long been suspected by P\u00e1li scholars that the P\u00e1li grammar of Kachch\u00e1yana is based upon the K\u00e1tantra, a Sanskrit grammar of about the tenth century A. D. I see no reason to doubt this; for, it seems to me, no one, who has examined the native treatises belonging to this school, can help arriving at this conclusion.\n\nThe author of the R\u00fapasiddhi, in his comment on parasama\u00f1\u00f1a payoge (Kachchh. I. 9) says that Kachch\u00e1yana adopts certain grammatical terms to be found \u2018in Sanskrit, or in the works of other grammarians;\u2019 one of those terms is linga, which, in its usual sense, means \u2018gender, sex;\u2019 but, as the same writer has it, in his comment on lingatthe patham\u00e1 (Kachch. III, 15) idha, p\u00e1tipadik\u00e1 paran\u00e1madheyyam, \u2018in this grammar (it is) another term for (the Sanskrit) pr\u00e1tipadik\u00e1,\u2019 i.e., the crude form or base of a noun. Subjoined are given the rulings on this term in P\u00e1nini, the K\u00e1tantra, and the P\u00e1li grammars:\n\n- arthavad adh\u00e1tur apratyayah pr\u00e1tipadikam.

Kuhn justly remarks, that amongst the K\u00e1tantras, and in Kachch\u00e1yana\u2019s grammar, the word linga has the same significance, a nominal base. But there are numerous other instances of agreement between the aphorisms of Kachch\u00e1yana and those of the K\u00e1tantra; indeed, in the K\u00e1raka book nearly every aphorism has a greater or less similarity with those in the same book in the K\u00e1tantra. To take for instance the first aphorism of the K\u00e1raka book of Kachch\u00e1yana, and the corresponding (eighth) aphorism of the same book in the K\u00e1tantra:\n\n* Separate edition.

Senart says, (p. 125)* that the author of the P\u00e1li aphorism must have had before him not only the text of the K\u00e1tantra ruling, but even the commentary of Durgasinha upon it.\n\nAgain, Pancami and Sattami for the Imperative and Potential moods are terms peculiar to Kachchhayana and the K\u00e1tantras (v. K\u00e1t. K\u00e1r. 18 and 20.) The B\u00e1livat\u00e1ra explains that they are 'the terminology of former teachers,' and Sadda Niti states that those terms are 'in accordance' with Sanskrit grammars such as the K\u00e1tantra.' [D\u2019Alwis, Cat. p. 61.]\n\nWe may infer, therefore, from his having the K\u00e1tantra before him, that the author of Kachchhayana\u2019s grammar did not live prior to the tenth century A. D.\n\nIt may be accepted as an historical fact that Buddhaghosa, bearing the Buddhist scriptures from Ceylon, came to Thahtun, which is situated a few miles north of Martaban, and which was then the capital city of one of the Talaing states. The year given for his arrival in the histories is A. D. 403, but probably he came within the period included in A. D. 410\u2014432. At this time there does not appear to have been much intercourse between the Talaings and Burmese. Buddhism was in a very corrupt state. We read of no effort being made to disseminate copies of these scriptures, and the Burmese people in the central Irrawaddy country appear to have remained isolated for some centuries.\n\nAbout six hundred years after, in the early part of the eleventh century A. D., the great hero of the later Burmese history, Anauarta, ascended the throne, and restored the ancient power of the Burmese monarchy. That this king conquered Thahtun, and procured the Buddhist scriptures from thence, cannot be doubted. His reform of religion is minutely and graphically described. He reigned forty-two years.\u2020\n\nAbout seven years after the death of Anauarta, certain Malabar princes invaded Ceylon, and obtained sovereignty over the island for twelve years, viz., 1059\u20141071 A. D. They were the most determined foes of Buddhism, and are stated to have systematically effected the destruction of all the sacred books they could lay hands on. These were afterwards replaced from Burma.\n\n* Separate edition. Paris, 1871.\n\u2020 Cf. History of the Burma race, by Sir A. P. Phayre, J. A. pp. 105, 106.\nIt has been satisfactorily proved by D'Alwis that Kachch\u00e1yana's grammar was not known to Buddhaghosa; he makes no allusion to it, nor is there any agreement between the terminology of Buddhaghosa and Kachch\u00e1yana. The Burmese acknowledge that they received it from Ceylon, and since it appeared after Buddhaghosa, it must have been composed subsequent to the date of the destruction of the sacred books in 1071 A.D., i.e., towards the close of the eleventh century. But for many years the island was torn by internal dissensions, and it was not until the close of the twelfth century, during the reign of king Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu I, a monarch who is styled \"the most martial, enterprising, and glorious in Sinhalese history\", that a new impulse was given to P\u00e1li grammatical literature, and that we hear the names of the earliest disciples of Buddha revived in the persons of eminent priests, whose literary tastes found encouragement under that enlightened monarch.\n\nThus the founders of the two schools of P\u00e1li Grammar assumed respectively the names of the right and left hand disciples of Gotama, viz., S\u00e1riputta, and Moggall\u00e1na. This may have given rise to the tradition that Kachch\u00e1yana's grammar was written about 500 years before the Christian era.\n\nIt is probable that S\u00e1riputta was some years older than Moggall\u00e1na, as the latter acknowledges his obligations to the former as his preceptor, and dedicates some of his works to him. It is true that the dedication might have been made in honour of the memory of some eminent priest of ancient times, yet the fact remains that the first distinguished priest, bearing that name, of whom mention is made subsequent to the age of the K\u00e1tantras, is S\u00e1riputta, the author of the Vinaya-sangaha and other works, and the contemporary of Moggall\u00e1na.\n\nIt is hoped that the foregoing statements will prove to the reader that the P\u00e1li grammar of Kachch\u00e1yana is based on the K\u00e1tantra, and that Kachch\u00e1yana lived in or about the twelfth century of the Christian era.\n\nA list is appended of some of the treatises, on grammar, rhetoric and prosody, which are to be found in the monasteries of Burma.\nA List of some of the treatises on grammar, rhetoric and prosody, which are to be found in the monasteries of Burma.\n\n| No. | Name of Treatise                  | Reputed author | Reputed place of abode | Reigning Sovereign | Authority |\n|-----|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------|\n| 1   | Kaechchayanappakaranam.          | Kachchayana.   | Ceylon.                | Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu I.  | Pitaka traditions or chronicles called in Burmese 'Pitakat thamain tsa,' S\u00e1san\u00e1lank\u00e1ra. |\n| 2   | Nettipakkaranam.                 | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 3   | Ch\u00fala Netti.                     | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 4   | Petakosala.                      | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 5   | Netti-athakatha.                 | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 6   | Vinayassangaha.                  | S\u00e1riputta.     | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 7   | S\u00e1ratthadipani.                  | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 8   | Anguttara-tik\u00e1.                  | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 9   | Kachchayana S\u00e1ra.                | Rassathera.    | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 10  | Kachchayana Bheda.               | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 11  | Ny\u00e1sa, or Mukhamatta d\u00edpani.     | Vimalabuddhi.  | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 12  | Padar\u00fapasiddhi.                  | Buddhapiya.    | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 13  | Balavat\u00e1ra.                      | Dhammakitta.   | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 14  | R\u00fapat\u00e1ra.                        | Buddhah\u00e1ta.    | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 15  | Moggall\u00e1na vyakarana.            | Moggall\u00e1na.    | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 16  | vutti.                           | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 17  | Abhidhanapadipik\u00e1.               | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 18  | Subodh\u00e1lan\u00e1k\u00e1ra.                 | Sangha rakkhita ther\u00e1. | \" |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 19  | Vuttodaya.                       | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 20  | Sambandhachint\u00e1 nissaya.         | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 21  | Netti.                           | Vach\u00ed Rassa ther\u00e1. | \" |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 22  | Gandh\u00e1bhara\u1e47a.                   | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 23  | Padas\u00e1dhana.                     | Anandapiyadasi. | \" |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 24  | Netti-athakatha.                 | Dhammap\u00e1la.    | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 25  | Netti-tik\u00e1.                      | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 26  | Itivutta.                        | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 27  | \" atthakatha.                    | \"              | \"                      |                    | Pit. trad. |\n| 28  | A.

A. S. B.\nDr. Hoernle remarked that he had listened with great interest to Col. Fryer's paper, but he could not say that his arguments had convinced him. Col. Fryer's position was, that the well-known grammar of Kachch\u00e1yana was composed about the 12th century of the Christian era by a Ceylonese priest, called S\u00e1riputta. But the Ceylonese themselves ascribed to the grammar an Indian origin. Col. Fryer said, that in the 12th century there lived two Ceylonese priests, bearing the names of the two famous disciples of Buddha, S\u00e1riputta and Moggall\u00e1na; to the latter, it appeared, the composition of a grammar was ascribed by the Ceylonese themselves, but not to the former, S\u00e1riputta. But Col. Fryer maintained that the Ceylonese were mistaken with respect to S\u00e1riputta, and that they erroneously ascribed Kachch\u00e1yana's grammar, which was really written by the Ceylonese S\u00e1riputta, to the famous Indian S\u00e1riputta, simply because of the identity of the two names. But if that were so, it was not easy to understand why a similar mistake was not made in the case of Moggall\u00e1na. If Ceylonese tradition was correct in ascribing a grammar to the Ceylonese Moggall\u00e1na, it may be accepted to be also correct, in not ascribing Kachch\u00e1yana's grammar to the Ceylonese S\u00e1riputta, but to an Indian Kachch\u00e1yana.\n\nHe had been informed by Dr. Mitra that Kachch\u00e1yana was already mentioned in the Mah\u00e1vamsa, in the 5th century A.D. In that case, it would be impossible that Kachch\u00e1yana should have lived in the 12th century A.D. But he did not recollect any such passage in the Mah\u00e1vamsa, and was inclined to suspect a misunderstanding. The mere mention of a famous person called Katy\u00e1yana was not sufficient to identify him with the Grammarian. The Chinese pilgrim Hwentsang, in the 8th century, also mentioned a certain Katy\u00e1yana, famous for his learning, the author of an Abhidharma and a Ko\u015ba, who was said to have lived 300 years after Buddha's nirv\u00e1na. It was not impossible that he might have been the Grammarian; but there was no direct evidence to identify them.\n\nCol. Fryer's arguments in support of his theory were, in the main, two. First, that there was a striking correspondence between Kachch\u00e1yana's grammar and the Sanskrit K\u00e1tantra grammar with regard to grammatical terminology. This circumstance was a well-known one; the question had been discussed by Dr. Burnell in his \"Aindra School of Sanskrit Grammarians,\" with which work Col. Fryer appeared to be unacquainted. Dr. Burnell showed that the terminology in question was one common to the Aindra or pre-P\u00e1\u00f1inian School of Sanskrit Grammarians; whence it followed that, when it was used in two grammars, it did not necessarily show that one borrowed from the other, but only that they both belonged to the same school. Not long ago he (Dr. Hoernle) had published an edition of Chanda's grammar of the Ancient Pr\u00e1krit, in which the same term...\nsense of \"nominal base\") occurred; yet the work must be very much older than the 10th century; it had been revised and recast over and over again, at various times, and in its latest revised form it was known to Hema Chandra, who lived in the middle of the 12th century. This simply showed that Chanda's grammar also belonged to the Aindra School. Col. Fryer ascribed the composition of the K\u00e1tantra grammar to the 10th century, but it did not appear on what grounds. Like many other ancient works, Kachch\u00e1yana's grammar may have passed through revisions; the commentary to it, in which Col. Fryer had pointed to one striking agreement with Durga Simha's commentary on the K\u00e1tantra, was not ascribed to Kachch\u00e1yana, but to Sanghanand\u00ed (as quoted by Dr. Burnell); and it might be possible that the commentary or one of the revisions of the grammar was made so late as the 12th century. Thus, while Kachch\u00e1yana's rule enjoined certain words (as divate) to be spelled with v, in agreement with the ancient practice of the Inscriptions, his commentator, after a much later fashion, spells them with b (dibbate). The circumstance that Kachch\u00e1yana's grammar was not known to Buddhagosha had been satisfactorily explained by Dr. Burnell in his work on the Aindra Grammarians.\n\nCol. Fryer's second argument was an historical one, but he (Dr. Hoernle) could not quite understand how it precluded the traditional ascription of the composition of the grammar in question to an Indian Kachch\u00e1yana. On the whole, he thought, therefore, that the question as to the identity of Kachch\u00e1yana must still be considered an open one.\n\nCol. Fryer still thought that the P\u00e1li of Ceylon and Burma was the language of Buddha used in Magadha. But most P\u00e1li scholars were now agreed that this was not so, though they were not quite agreed to which exact locality in India it should be referred. The reasons against P\u00e1li being M\u00e1gadhi were very strong; the exceptional (by no means \"common,\" as Col. Fryer said) occurrence of e for o\u2014a fact not unknown hitherto\u2014was not at all decisive.\n\nThe following note was subsequently received from Col. Fryer:\n\n\"According to Ariyavamsa\u2014who in 1439 A.D. wrote Kachch\u00e1yana bheda tik\u00e1\u2014the commentator Sanghanandi and Kachch\u00e1yana are the same person, and the illustrations are ascribed by him to Brahmadatta: for he says 'im\u00e1n\u00ed sutt\u00e1n\u00ed mah\u00e1kachch\u00e1yanena kat\u00e1n\u00ed, vutti ca sanghanand\u00edsankahtena mah\u00e1kachch\u00e1yanen' eva kat\u00e1, payogo brahmadattena kato ti Vuttam c'etam:\n\nKachch\u00e1yanakato yogo vutt\u00ed ca sanghanandino, payogo brahmadattena ny\u00e1so vimalabuddhina [App. D'Alw. Introd. p. 104].\n\nOmitting the illustrations 'dibbate' &c. ascribed to Brahmadatta, Kachch\u00e1yana's rule, and Sanghanandi's comment thereon, singularly alike, are subjoined:\"\nRule, tassa chavaggayak\u00e1rarak\u00e1rettam sadh\u00e1tvantassa.\nComm., tassa yappachchayassa chavaggayak\u00e1rvak\u00e1rettam hot\u00ed dh\u00e1t-\nvantena saha yath\u00e1sambhavam [Kacc.

S., M. R. A. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn the Selections from the Records of the Panj\u00e1b Government, Sec-\ntion I, 1882, are some \u201cLinguistic Fragments\u201d by Dr. Leitner. Among\nthese \u201cfragments\u201d are some words and phrases used by the Naqq\u00e1sh or\npapier-mach\u00e9 painters of the Panj\u00e1b and Kashmir as a trade dialect or\narg\u00f3t, and also a long list of numerals used by the shawl-weavers of Kash-\nmir and the Panj\u00e1b. Lieutenant Temple lately had an opportunity of\ntesting both these lists, and found them to be in the main correctly record-\ned, i.e., according to his own ear, though in two or three instances he\nobserved discrepancies. He discusses these differences and gives a list of\nadditional words and phrases which he was enabled to record. He then\nenters into the question whether these words are part of a bonafide dialect\nor merely an arg\u00f3t, a more or less conscious formation of words for the\npurposes of secrecy; and gives his reasons for believing that, when there\nare more data available than at present, the bulk of the words will be\nfound to be really dialectic and traceable to surrounding idioms or to the\nformer stages of the modern Aryan languages, but that in some cases\nwords have been inverted and nonsense-syllables prefixed or affixed in order\nto hide their true form. In conclusion, Lieutenant Temple remarks that\nif Dr. Leitner\u2019s hope, that the Trade Dialects will be found to preserve an\nancient language, is to become a reality, the enquiry must be taken up by\nmore than one person. The range of knowledge required is too wide, and\nthe investigations necessary too minute and searching, to admit of one\nindividual solving the problem presented in a satisfactory manner.\n\nThe President announced that the next meeting of the Society would\nbe held on the 1st of November.\n\n* [Fausb\u00f6ll\u2019s system of transliteration had been followed by Col. Fryer in his\npaper. But as some letters of that system do not exist in the Society\u2019s Press, it has\nbeen thought better to preserve uniformity by substituting the system adopted by\nthe Society in all their publications.

On the Pagoda or Varaha Coins of Southern India.\u2014By Dr. G. Bidie,\n   Government Central Museum, Madras.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe unit of the monetary system of Southern India in old times was the gold pagoda, subdivided into fanams and cash. Latterly from political causes, which are discussed in this paper, the varieties of these coins became very numerous, so that their discrimination at the present day is a matter of some difficulty. Taken as a whole, the pagodas afford most valuable and interesting information regarding the early political history of India south of the Kistna. Their value in this respect was long overlooked, and no systematic attempt was made until recently to form a permanent public collection of the series. Owing to this neglect, many of the older forms are quite unknown to numismatists, and there is little prospect of making good the defect. As regards those that have been preserved, very little information of a reliable kind has been recorded and the few facts that remain refer mostly to the more modern forms and are scattered in local histories, travels, &c., which sometimes contain incidental allusions to the currency of the day.\n\nTo numismatists who have been accustomed to study old European coins or those of the Muhammadan sovereigns of India, the Madras pagodas appear particularly puzzling and uninteresting, as they do not always bear the name of the sovereign who struck them, and never give any information as to the place or date of mintage. The derivation of the name pagoda is discussed, and that given by Bartolomeo, who lived in Southern India from 1776 to 1789, adopted. The forms of the pagoda of which there are specimens in the Madras Museum are divided into the following groups, arranged according to dynasties and in chronological order: (1) Buddhist Coins, (2) Chalukya Coins, (3) Nonambavadi Coins, (4) Coins of the Gajapati Dynasty, or Elephant Lords, (5) the Lingayat Pagoda, (6) Vyanagar or Bijanagar Pagodas, (7) the Gandikota Pagoda, (8)\ndroog Pagoda, (9) the Travancore Pagoda, (10) East India Company's Pagodas, (11) Adoni Pagodas, and (12) Mysore Pagodas.\n\nThe circumstances under which the coins of each group were probably struck are discussed, and detailed descriptions with figures given of the specimens in the Madras Museum.\n\nThis paper will be published with plates in the Journal, Part I, 1882.\n\n2. Notes on the Butterflies of India.\u2014By Major G. F. L. Marshall, R. E.\n\nSince the publication of the first Part of Vol. I, of \"The Butterflies of India, Burmah and Ceylon,\"* a small collection and some notes have been sent by Captain C. H. E. Adamson from Akyab, which furnish some additional information as to the distribution of some of the Dana\u00efnae.\n\nNo. 5. *Hestia cadelli.* A single male specimen of a *Hestia* was taken on the sea coast at Akyab, which, Captain Adamson writes, corresponded mark for mark with the figure given of this species (Pl. IV, fig. 2 &). I have not seen the specimen, but I feel convinced that it must really have belonged to the form named *agamarachana* which has recently been taken in the Mergui archipelago. In either case the occurrence of a *Hestia* of this type so far north is worthy of note.\n\nNo. 20. *Dana\u00efs tytia.* Captain Adamson remarks that this, in Tenasserim as in India, is a hill insect, comparatively rare, and that in the plains it is replaced by *D. melaneus* which is far commoner.\n\nNo. 24. *Dana\u00efs gautama.* Captain Adamson sends several specimens taken at one locality on the seashore at Akyab where they were in company with *D. genutia*, *D. hegesippus*, *D. chrysippus* and *D. septentrionis* which were all abundant at that one spot. He writes, \"Had I not been specially looking for them I should have passed them over as *D. septentrionis*, but now I can tell the difference at once on the wing: *D. gautama* shows much less blue when on the wing and is more like *D. aglaea* in appearance, except for its larger size.\"\n\nNo. 34. *Dana\u00efs hegesippus.* Captain Adamson has taken a curious variety of this species with an additional white spot below the subapical series in the fulvous space between the first median nervule and submedian nervure: only three specimens of this variety were taken and all at the same spot.\n\nNo. 40. *Euploea margarita.* A specimen from Moulmein of typical *margarita* has the forewing with only two minute white marginal spots.\n\n* The Butterflies of India, Burmah and Ceylon; a descriptive hand-book of all the known species, by Major G. F. L. Marshall, R. E., and Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville. Published at Calcutta by the Calcutta Central Press Co., 5, Council House Street.\nat the hinder angle, and the blue shot extends very nearly to the margin; the shape of the forewing in this specimen and the dark tone of the margin strengthen the possibility of this species being separable from *E. adamseni*.\n\nNo. 44. *Euploea klugii*. A male specimen of typical coloration was taken at Akyab: this is the most southern locality yet recorded for this species.\n\nNo. 48. *Euploea vestigiata*. A very large female of this species taken at Moulemein has on the hindwing at the anal angle three diffused and coalescent whitish spots. It corresponds with the description of *E. leucogonya*, and its large size throws doubt on the distinctness of the latter species.\n\nNo. 60. *Euploea bremeri*. A female specimen is sent from Akyab where it was taken in July by Captain Adamson; this is considerably north of any locality yet recorded for this insect.\n\nNo. 61. *Euploea core*. A typical male specimen from Akyab was among the collection; it shows no approach to the Burman form *E. subdita*, which latter was taken at the same place by Mr. Wood-Mason. The fact of the two forms being distinct at the same boundary establishes *E. subdita* as a good species.\n\nNo. 68. *Euploea godartii*. A very remarkable female specimen was taken at Akyab in July, in which there is no trace whatever of the violet apical patch; the outer margin too is more emarginate than is usual. Akyab is the most northern defined locality at which this species has been taken.\n\n3. Coins, supplementary to \"The Chronicles of the Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns of Delhi.\" No. III.\u2014By C. J. Rodgers.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nMr. Rodgers describes in this paper some coins received from Afghanistan and India which have not yet been edited. The coins are described in detail with figures and the inscriptions thereon transcribed. Mr. Rodgers then discusses the peculiarities of each, drawing attention to any points of history that have a fresh light thrown upon them by the inscriptions on the coins. The most important of these coins is one of Yattamada Kanalraka which bears the name of the mint, \"Gazni.\" Up to the present all that was known of this ruler was that he was a ruler of Sind, and that his father had ruled in Gazni and Karm\u00e1n. This coin gives evidence of his having ruled in his father's dominions. Another coin of importance is a small damri of Taimur struck at Delhi. It is believed to be unique and is the only one of Taimur's Indian coins that Mr. Rodgers has seen.\n\nThis paper will be published with plates in the Journal, Part 1, 1882.\n4. Second notice of Relics from Ancient Persia, in gold, silver, and copper.\u2014By Major-General Cunningham, C. S. I.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper describes several new objects discovered since the first notice was written.* These relics were found on the banks of the Oxus, near a place called Kawat or Kuad, two marches from Kunduz and about midway between Khulm and Kaliadan. This is one of the most frequented ferries on the Oxus, and has always been the chief thoroughfare on the road to Samarkand. It is said that the owner of the land has now stopped all search by other people and intends to explore on his own account. The coins which General Cunningham has seen consist of 14 gold and 76 silver pieces, and he concludes from them that the deposit must have been made before the time of Mithridates I. The following ornaments and other articles of gold which have been discovered are described in this paper:\u2014a gold circle of large size, with two winged and horned griffons at the ends; a small figure of solid gold representing a \"magus\" in full costume with the barsom, or holy wand, in his right hand; a gold seal with five deeply cut symbols somewhat like hieroglyphic characters; a thin gold ring of inferior workmanship, representing a lion couchant; a circular boss, convex on the upper surface, with a hunting scene depicted on it, probably the central boss of a shield; a plain gold bracelet of one coil ending in two antelope heads; a ribbed bracelet of two coils ending in two lions' heads; a spirally twisted bracelet of three coils ending in two antelope heads; and two lions' heads, each of which probably formed one end of a bracelet.\n\nThis paper will also be published with plates in the Journal, Part I, 1882.\n\n* Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. L, Part I, 1881.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in August last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

R. H. Merk, Esq.\nWalter Lawrence, Esq.\n\nThe following gentlemen are candidates for election at the next meeting:\n\n1. Major Trevor Plowden, B. S. C., Simla, proposed by D. Ibbetson, Esq., seconded by J. Wilson, Esq.\n2. Francis H. Harding, Esq., C. S., Tajpore, Darbhanga, proposed by A. Pedler, Esq., seconded by Dr. H. W. M'Cann.\n\nThe following gentleman has intimated his desire to withdraw from the Society:\n\nNey Elias, Esq.\n\nThe Council reported that P. C. Wheeler, Esq., C. S., Allahabad, had, after repeated applications, refused to pay his subscription for a period for part of which he had received the publications of the Society, and his name would in consequence be suspended for a month in the Society's rooms as a defaulter.\n\nThe President announced that Dr. J. Scully had kindly consented to act as Natural History Secretary.\n\nThe President announced that the Council recommended certain changes in the Rules as set forth in the following circular which had been forwarded to all resident members, according to Rule 64 A:\n\n\"In accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Rules of the Society (64, 65, 78), the Council circulate to the resident Members the following statement of certain proposed changes in the Rules and of the reasons which induce Council to recommend them.\n\n\"The Council propose to insert in Rule 15, after the word 'Rule,' the words 'and to serve on any Committee appointed by Council': and after the word 'vote,' the words 'except on such Committees': also, in Rule 61, to insert, after the word 'appoint', the words 'Honorary or Associate Members, or', and to omit the comma after the words 'Ordinary Members'. These two Rules as they are at present read as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Rule 15. Honorary and Associate Members shall be entitled to the privileges contained in Clauses (a), (d), and (f) of the preceding Rule, save that they shall not be entitled to vote.\n\n\"Rule 61. The Council may elect, from among their own body, Committees or Sections for the consideration of special subjects. They also may appoint Ordinary Members, other than Members of Council, who are competent and well versed in the subjects to be referred to these Committees, to be Members of such Committees.\"\n\"With the proposed changes, they will read:\n\n\"RULE 15. Honorary and Associate Members shall be entitled to the privileges contained in Clauses (a), (d) and (f) of the preceding Rule, and to serve on any Committees appointed by Council, save that they shall not be entitled to vote, except on such Committees.\n\n\"RULE 61. The Council may elect, from among their own body, Committees or Sections for the consideration of special subjects. They may also appoint Honorary or Associate Members, or Ordinary Members other than Members of Council, who are competent and well versed in the subjects to be referred to these Committees, to be Members of such Committees.\n\n\"According to the Rules as they are at present, no Honorary or Associate Member can serve on any of the Committees appointed by Council. The Society is thus prevented from obtaining the advice of several gentlemen in close connection with the Society who are experts in their several subjects, and no compensating benefit accrues from the observance of these Rules. The question is now raised because it has been lately pointed out that Major-General A. Cunningham, Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, who has for many years been a Member of the Philological and Coins Committees of the Society, is an Honorary Member and therefore cannot serve on a Committee. General Cunningham's advice and opinion on all matters relating to coins and antiquities have been, and are of immense service to the Society, and the Society's Secretaries regularly avail themselves of his assistance as a member of these Committees, as may be seen from consulting the Society's Proceedings. But now that the attention of Council has been drawn to the two Rules in question, it will be impossible to re-elect General Cunningham a Member of these Committees, unless the Rules are altered as above. So that an observance of these Rules will result in distinct injury to the Society. And, besides the case of General Cunningham, there are other cases in which the Rules prevent the Society from securing the advice of scientific experts, such as Father Lafont, who would gladly assist the Society with their opinion, but are prevented from sitting on Committees owing to the undoubted meaning of the Rules. The Council therefore strongly recommend the above changes. The Society's Committees are consultative bodies and have not the power to take any initiative of themselves: they merely advise Council on matters on which Council seeks their opinion before itself coming to a decision. This being the case, Council are of opinion that there cannot possibly be any objection to strengthening these consultative bodies by adding to them such Honorary or Associate Members as are experts in their several subjects.\n\n\"The proposed changes will be brought up for discussion at the Ordinary General meeting of the Society on Wednesday, December 6th. Voting papers will be afterwards issued to all members, resident and non-resident, containing, in addition to this statement of the Council's reasons for recommending the change, a statement of any objections that may be raised to the proposal at this meeting. The votes will be finally taken at the February meeting of the Society.\"\n\nThe changes proposed by the Council were unanimously approved by the meeting.\n\nThe Secretary read the following extracts from a letter from Mr. D. Ibbetson, Deputy Commissioner of the Punjab Census, Lahore, forwarding a memorandum asking for information regarding the Ethnology of the Panjab:\n\"My object in addressing you is to ask you to help me in the inquiry I have undertaken,\u2014an inquiry which will probably occupy my leisure for several years. What I would beg you to do is this: whenever you come across any interesting facts regarding any caste or clan or its customs, make a rough note of them at once and on the spot, before they are forgotten, and send it to me. It does not matter how rough the notes are; but notes regarding separate castes or clans should be, if possible, on separate pieces of paper. It does not matter how absurd the story told you, or how seemingly trivial the facts collected. Caste legends generally have some substratum of truth, which can often be eliminated by comparing different forms of the same story derived from various sources; and an independent confirmation of even the smallest detail is often valuable.\n\n\"It is in the power of every one to help, if he cares to do so. Even officers who do not travel about among the people constantly come across curious facts and customs in the course of trials and investigations, while the natives are often more communicative to those who do not hold an official position than to those who do.\n\n\"The following are some of the points which may usefully be noted:\u2014\n\n\"Name of the tribe or caste; names of its sub-divisions; localities in which it is found in largest numbers; different names by which it is known, often varying with the religion; its traditional mode and place of origin; its course of migration, and especially the place whence it came direct to its present home; the religions followed by its members; whether, if not Hindus, they employed Br\u00e1hmans, and in what manner; any traditions or customs connecting them with, or involving reverence for, any particular plant or animal; whether they practise karewa or widow-marriage; what castes or tribes they may or may not intermarry with; what their position is in the social scale; what occupations they principally follow, and whether they vary with the religion.\n\n\"Information regarding the vagrant, servile, and out-caste tribes and the people of the hills is especially needed; while little is known of the internal constitution, and government by means of standing panch\u00e1yats, of the menial and artisan castes and trade-guilds.\n\n\"The religion of the peasantry is something very different from the Hinduism of books; while their social customs have been handed down almost unaltered from remote ages. All facts regarding their gods and saints and the mode in which they worship them, the omens they regard, the superstitions they are ruled by, their ceremonial at births, deaths, betrothals, marriages, and adoption, the relations between members of a family, and in fact their customs and ways of life generally, are always most interesting and often exceedingly valuable. The inhabitants of the Punjab have been drawn from many sources at various periods; and our best hope\nof tracing each tribe back to its original stock lies in collecting and comparing their customs and traditions. Most valuable of all are what may be called differential customs; that is to say, points in which the customs of one tribe differ from those of its neighbours. Peculiarities in even such minor respects as dress, jewels, food, drink, and the like, often afford useful indications.\n\n\"Local songs and proverbs, which should be taken down exactly as spoken by the people, are full of interest. Fairs and festivals are important and generally have some religious significance. New sects and ascetic orders are springing up daily; while little is known about many of the old ones. In fact it is impossible to mention any part of the life of the people regarding which information is not needed, and may not give valuable help.\n\n\"In the hope that it may be useful to some such, I have prepared a rough memorandum on the points to which, so far as I know, inquiry may be most usefully directed. I shall be glad to send any body a copy of it who will let me have a post-card to say that he would like one.\"\n\nLieut.-Genl. J. T. Walker gave intimation of the return of a party of explorers from Tibet, with a sketch of the line of exploration. He informed the meeting that, five years ago, he made arrangements to send one of the Trans-Himalayan explorers of the Survey Department into the regions of Northern Tibet which are crossed by the parallel of 40\u00b0 of latitude. In those days, Prejevalsky had not yet made his famous journey from Guldja to Lob Nur, and there was a great belt of territory between Eastern Turkestan and Mongolia which was almost absolutely unknown. A native of India who had accompanied the celebrated Pandit Nain Singh in his explorations was especially trained by the andit to undertake this new exploration. He started from India in the summer of 1878 with two companions; for a long time no tidings were received of him; but about a year ago very distressing rumours reached Nain Singh to the effect that the explorer and his companions had been seized by the authorities at Lassa, that one of his companions who was a Tibetan had been put to death for having brought a foreigner into the country, and that he himself had had his legs broken in order to put it out of his power to make further explorations. Happily this tale turned out to be a pure fabrication, concocted very probably by his second companion who had meanwhile robbed and deserted him. In May last, tidings were received from the Vicar Apostolic of Tibet, who resides at Ta-Tsien-lu, that the explorer had reached Ta-Tsien-lu in safety last February, and that he was about to return to India by the direct route via Assam. He reached\nCalcutta a few days ago, bringing with him not only his journals, but his instruments, which he has managed to secrete and preserve in some wonderful manner, notwithstanding that on two occasions he was robbed of the greater portion of his property.\n\nHe has taken a number of astronomical and boiling point observations and kept up a more or less continuous record of bearings and distances along the line of his traverse. Some time must elapse before his observations can be reduced and plotted; thus General Walker was not in a position to give the meeting any very definite information regarding the geographical results of this last and most important exploration. He would, however, briefly indicate the general direction of the lines of operation.\n\nThe explorer, after spending some time at Lassa in purchasing merchandise for sale in the regions to which he was bound and making arrangements to join a kafila of traders returning to Mongolia, eventually succeeded in making a good start. He accompanied the kafila as far as a place called Thingali, which may be some 150 miles to the west of the Lake Koko Nur; there, in December, 1879, the kafila was attacked by a band of some hundred mounted men of the Chiamogolak tribe; they robbed the explorer of most of his property, but had the grace to leave him about Rs. 200 worth of merchandise wherewith to prosecute his enterprise, and they did not appropriate his surveying instruments.\n\nFrom Thingali he struck off to the North-West, and eventually reached a place called Saithang, where he had to wait for the formation of a kafila of travellers proceeding towards Lob Nur; there he was deserted by one of his companions who robbed him of most of his little remaining property and his telescope. Though left nearly destitute, he was resolved not to turn back if he could by any means avoid doing so. He and his remaining companion therefore took service with some Mongolians and tended their herds of horses for some months. Eventually they determined to move on with the limited funds at their disposal, and when these failed to beg their way. They advanced to a place called Saitu, which may possibly be identical with Marco Polo's Sachiu; there they were detained seven months by Chinese Tartars whom they were compelled to serve. Eventually a friendly Lama came to their assistance and rescued them, and in his service they returned to Saithang and proceeded south-eastwards to Barong Chaidam\u2014some 100 miles to the west of Lake Koko Nur,\u2014and then southwards 300 miles to the Thuden Gompa Monastery. There they entered the service of a Chinese Tartar whom they accompanied to Darchendo, or Ta-Tsien-lu, where they were kindly welcomed and helped by the Jesuit Fathers. They then commenced their return journey to India. Proceeding via Batang and Dzayul, they reached Sama, a village on the eastern border of the country of the Mishmis; they endeavoured to make arrangements to cross the belt of Mishmi country between Sama and the British\nFrontier, but did not succeed in so doing; and being told that they would probably be murdered if they trusted themselves to such savages as the Mishmis, they turned northwards and took the circuitous route through southern Tibet towards Lassa, via Alanto and Gianda, as far as the latter place, from which they turned down south-westwards to Chetang on the Sanpo river, avoiding Lassa. Thence they proceeded via Giangze Jong and Phari to Darjeeling, returning safety to British territory after an absence of more than four years.\n\nThe explorer states that Sama, the village on the Mishmi border at which they turned away from the direct route to Assam, is situated on a river flowing into Assam, and is the place at which two Padre Sahibs were murdered some thirty years ago. Thus it is identified with the Sami of the Rev. T. D. Mazure, Vicar Apostolic of Tibet, in his memorandum on the countries between Thibet, Yunan and Burma\u2014in volume XXX of the Journal of the Asiatic Society\u2014in which he speaks of it as the place where the two priests, Messrs. Krick and Boury, were murdered. The Vicar was, however, under the impression that his Sami was situated in the valley of a river flowing into the Irawadi; but Colonel Yule, in his notes to the Vicar's paper, points out that we know from the reports of the British officers in Upper Assam that the two priests were murdered (about the month of August, 1854) at a village, called Sim\u00e9 in Wilcox's map, which is situated on the banks of the Bramakund river, the Eastern Brahmaputra, and he goes on to say that \"this murder of two missionaries becomes thus in fact the basis of a geographical connection between British India and Thibet.\" This remark is even more apposite at the present time than it was originally; for the murder of the missionaries enables us to identify with certainty the nearest point to the British frontier which was reached by the explorer on his attempt to return to India via Assam. Wilcox reconnoitred the Brahmakund river up as far as the village of Samleh, and he obtained the positions of several of the villages higher up from native information; thus it appears that his Sim\u00e9 was about 18 miles beyond Samleh; for this portion of the river we as yet have no route survey; but the distance is so short that we may accept the position assigned to Sim\u00e9 in Wilcox's map without hesitation.\n\nThis being the case, the fact that the explorer was unable to proceed to India directly through the Mishmi country, but was compelled to make a considerable detour to the north, has been the means of our acquiring much additional geographical information, and more particularly of laying at rest the frequently mooted question whether the great Sanpo river of Tibet flows into the Irawadi river or into the Brahmaputra. If the former, the explorer must have crossed it three times, first between Batang and Sama, secondly between Sama and Alanto, and finally at Chetang. He\nmaintains that he only crossed it at Chetang, and that to the west of his route between Sama and Alonto there is a great range of hills forming the water-parting between the affluents of the Sanpo river and those of the well-known system of parallel Tibetan rivers which he crossed between Batang and Sama. He knows the Sanpo river well and has crossed it frequently and in various places, and he is satisfied that none of the affluents of the system of parallel rivers which he crossed can possibly be the Sanpo.\n\nA full account of his explorations will be published, with maps in illustration, as soon as possible, probably within six months. Meanwhile, however, this statement of general outlines will suffice to show that the explorer has worked with great pluck and perseverance, never allowing himself to be turned back by misfortune and disaster until he had succeeded in accomplishing a highly creditable amount of work, and meanwhile taking service with Mongolians, Lamas and Chinese Tartars, with a view to earn a livelihood for himself and his companion while carrying out their explorations.\n\nThe following papers were read\u2014\n\n1. The Delhi Dal\u00e1ls and their Slang.\u2014By Lieut. R. C. Temple, B. S. C., F. R. G. S., M. R. A. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this paper the author has endeavoured to elucidate the derivation of some of the slang words used by the well-known Delhi dal\u00e1ls and to show how far their words affect the dialects in use among Northern Indian traders. He gives an account of the dal\u00e1ls and their way of making a living, which is not by brokerage, but by what they can make out of the customer through the trader, and what the customer pays them for their trouble. The author mentions the different ways in which the dal\u00e1l comes to a secret understanding with the trader as to the amount of commission he is to receive, and gives a list of slang words used by him with their meanings.\n\n2. The Rupees of the months of the Ilahi years of Akbar.\u2014By C. J. Rodgers.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe Persian year was instituted by Yezdegird III, eight days after the death of Muhammad. The year was divided into 365 days. There were twelve months, each of which had 30 days except the twelfth which had 35 days. The fractions of the days in 120 years made another month, so that every 120 years there were 13 months in the year. On the first such occurrence, the first month was duplicated: on the second, the second month, and so on. Malik Shah; Sultan of Khorasan, improved somewhat on this system. Making his year commence with the entrance of the Sun into Aries, he ordered that the year should receive an\nadditional day whenever it was required. This was mostly as with us\u2014every fourth year. But after the day had been added seven or eight times the addition was postponed for a year. In the 30th year of Akbar, i.e., in 992 A.H., Hakim Fath Ullah Shirazi introduced a new era and year for India. The object in view was to create a uniform year throughout the vast empire Akbar had conquered. The era began with the reign of Akbar, i.e., on 19th February, 1556. The months and days were similar to those of the Persian year, but there were no intercalary days. Hence the days of this year never corresponded with the years of Malik Shah's era. This year was termed \"Ilahi\"\u2014up to the year 992 A.H.\n\nAkbar's coins are strictly orthodox in their inscriptions. The name and titles of the emperor occupy the obverse, the margins, containing the mint, &c., being in nearly all cases illegible. The reverse has the Kalimah, and its fragmentary margins are embellished with portions of the names of the four companions of Muhammad. From the 80th year of Akbar's reign coins with the Ilahi years on them began to be struck. On these coins, instead of the Kalimah the following sentence is given: \"God is the greatest, may His brightness shine forth.\" The inscription is completed by the name of the mint and the year and the month in which the coin was struck. Mr. Rodgers in this paper gives descriptions of rupees of each month of the same years.\n\n3. Second list of Butterflies taken in Sikkim in October, 1882, with notes on habits, &c.\u2014By Lionel de Nice'ville.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn this list 203 species of Butterflies are enumerated, most of which were met with at a low elevation. One new species is described, and a second species which had been figured under an erroneous name, is re-named. The author points out the probable locality where most of the species of Butterflies which come from Sikkim are collected, and also one of the modes the Lepchas adopt to capture these specimens.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in November last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.
