These MSS. had been acquired by C. M. Whish of the Madras Civil Service, and were presented to the Society by his brother J. L. Whish Esq. in July 1836. In most of these MSS. entries with the signature of C. M. Whish are found, and many of them show traces of having been read and studied by a European scholar. The entries are generally dated, the earliest date being 1822\\(^1\\), and the latest 1831. Some of the MSS may have been copied for Mr. Whish at that time. A certain date can be assigned only to those few MSS.\\(^2\\) which are dated by the Kollam era and were written between A.D. 1787 and 1827. Most of the others, dated by years of the Jupiter cycle, or bearing no dates at all, were probably written about the same time, that is to say, at the end of the 18th or the beginning of the 19th century. Only a few MSS. seem to be a good deal older and may belong to the earlier part of the 17th century. Generally speaking, the MSS. in Malayalam characters are older than those written in Grantha. In some of the Malayalam MSS.,\\(^3\\) especially in those of apparent greater antiquity, the peculiar paging by Ak\u1e63aras is found to which Professor C. Bendall has drawn attention in the JRAS, October 1896, pp. 790 sq. According to this\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In No. 138 (see p. 194) the date 1817 is probably only indistinctly written and meant for 1827.\n\n\\(^2\\) Nos. 103, 113, 122, 138, 139, 141, 142, 145, 146, 150.\n\n\\(^3\\) See Nos. 19, 108, 118, 128, 129, 138, 151, 157, 158.\nsystem, the Ak\u1e63aras na\u00b9, nna, nya, \u015bkra, jhra, h\u0101, gra, pra, dre, ma are used for the numbers 1\u201410, tha, la, pta, ba, tra, tr\u016b or tru, ci, \u1e45a for 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90. For 100 and 200 the signs and (\u2261 = \u1e45a and \u1e45\u1e45a?) are used.\n\nBesides the Whish MSS. there are also a number of other South Indian MSS. (Sansk. Nos. 1\u201428) described in this Catalogue, about which I could not get any satisfactory information. I found them mixed up with a large number of Tamil MSS. Prof. Rhys Davids tells me that they were always kept together with the Whish MSS., and he is inclined to think that they, too, belong to the same collection though \u201cit is not quite certain that they really formed part of the Whish donation.\u201d They are nearly all written in Grantha, and seem, for the greater part, to have been written at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nBut though the MSS. here described are not distinguished by great age, there are many rare and valuable MSS. among them. Perhaps the most important of all are the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata MSS. which represent a distinct recension of the great Epic. Some years ago \u2014 at the International Congress of Orientalists in Paris, 1897 \u2014 I first drew attention to these MSS., and pointing out the great differences between the text offered by these South-Indian MSS. and that of the Calcutta and Bombay editions \u2014 the so-called Vulgata \u2014, I showed the insufficiency of the latter, and made an appeal for a critical edition of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata which I declared to be the sine qua non of any critical study of the great Epic. This appeal met with much sympathy among Sanskrit scholars, and there is now every reason to hope that such a critical edition will be begun in no distant future. The Whish MSS. of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to which we thus owe the plan of a\n\n\u00b9 Sometimes the first leaf is marked with \u2018hari\u1e25 \u015bri\u2019, and the paging by na, nna, nya etc. begins with the second leaf, e.g. in No.157.\n\u00b2 For other ways of numbering the pages by Ak\u1e63aras, see pp. 21, 27, 93, 166, 178, 221.\ncritical edition of the great epic, will prove invaluable whenever this plan is to be carried out.\n\nAmong the Vedic MSS., I may point out a MS. of the Taittir\u012bya-\u0100ranyaka (No. 178) which should prove useful for a critical edition of that text \u2014 a great desideratum, as R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra\u2019s edition is anything but satisfactory.\n\nSeveral MSS. of our Collection have already been used or are still being used for critical editions, e.g. the MSS. of S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s \u1e5agveda-Bh\u0101sya (Nos. 1a, 2 and 13), of the Grhyas\u016btra, Mantrap\u0101\u1e6dha, and Dharmas\u016btra of the \u0100pastambius with their Commentaries (Nos. 26, 27, 37), and of S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s Commentary on the Mantrabrahmana (No. 86).\n\nHow valuable the MS. Collections of the Royal Asiatic Society were, has already been known since 1890, when a rough list of the titles of the Sanskrit MSS. in the Todd and Whish Collections of the Society was published (JRAS, N. S., Vol. XXII, pp. 801\u2014813). It was intended then already to publish a proper catalogue as soon as the funds of the Society would permit. But it was considered probable that so long a period would necessarily elapse before this could be done, that it was advisable at once to publish such a rough list, however incomplete and incorrect. And it will, indeed, be now seen that the Whish Collection, at any rate, contains many more numbers and above all many more works and fragments of works than those mentioned in the rough list.\n\nThe forecast of delay was also fully justified by the event. The rough list appeared in 1890. We are now in 1902. But when, in May 1894, the preparation of this catalogue\n\n---\n\n1 A MS. \u2018Whish No. 66\u2019 mentioned by Prof. Kern as having been used for his edition of the \u0100ryabhatiya (Leiden 1874) has not been found among the MSS. which I have catalogued.\n\n2 For a complete list of all the numbers of the Whish Collection including also those which contain vernacular (chiefly Malayalam) texts and have therefore not been described in this Catalogue, see below pp. XII\u2014XV.\nwas entrusted to me by the Council of the Society the funds available were not sufficient to enable me to give my whole time to the work. I have been working at it, while I was living at Oxford, for several years, but the work had often to be interrupted on account of more pressing professional work. In 1898 I left England, and some of the MSS. had to be sent over to Prague, so that the progress of the work became still slower. Finally, to avoid further delays, Mr. Thomas kindly undertook to describe the MSS. which I had not yet seen, and their descriptions will be found in the Appendix as Nos. 191-215.\n\nA Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. is of not much use, unless extracts from the works they contain are given. For in most cases the mere title of a Sanskrit work tells us nothing about its character or contents. And even in the case of well-known texts, a few short extracts (at least the beginning and the end) seem to me necessary, in order to give some idea of the correctness and value of a MS. With this end in view I have given extracts, however short, from nearly every MS., and I have made a point of copying these extracts as accurately as possible from the MSS. A compiler of a catalogue is not an editor, and I did not think it the duty of the compiler to correct his quotations. Wherever corrections suggested themselves to me, I have given them in parenthesis or banished them to footnotes.\\(^1\\) The peculiar orthography of South Indian MSS. has also been retained throughout. Thus, as regards the nasals, I have written with the MSS. annan tu, sarasvat\\(\\text{in}\\) devim etc. (and not annaim tu, sarasvatim de\\(^o\\)), and as regards the Sandhi before sibilants I have followed the MSS. in omitting the Visarga before a sibilant with following consonant (puna \u015brutil\\(\\text{h}\\), vim\u015ba strij\u0101takam etc.). I have also written with the MSS. talpara, ulpanna etc., and even atpa for alpa, also tatbuddhis, p\u0101tma etc. for\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Words or Ak\u1e63aras added by conjecture, have been put in parenthesis (\\( \\)), while square brackets \\([\\ ]\\) have been used to mark words and syllables as to be omitted.\ntadbu\u00b0, p\u0101dma etc., \u015bru\u1e47u for \u015br\u1e47u, and cerebral l between two vowels, e.g. K\u0101lid\u0101sa, ma\u1e45gala, etc. Only in the Index I have used the ordinary orthography.\n\nIn preparing a catalogue of South Indian MSS. one has to encounter far greater difficulties than in having to deal with N\u0101gar\u012b MSS. The reading of palm leaves is always very trying to the eyes, and the Malayalam characters are particularly difficult to read, and often very indistinct. Moreover the leaves are frequently mutilated or rubbed off, especially at the beginning and at the end, and \u2014 what is the worst \u2014 one MS. generally contains fragments of several different works, without beginning and end.\n\nIn overcoming these difficulties, I had, as every compiler of a Sanskrit catalogue now has, the help of Professor Aufrecht's monumental work, the Catalogus Catalogorum. But I had also the good fortune of Prof. Aufrecht's more immediate help, for he was kind enough to take the trouble of reading the proofs, and I owe to him many most valuable suggestions and corrections, and in more than one case he has helped me to identify some short and very puzzling fragment. I am fulfilling a pleasant duty in expressing to him my sincerest thanks for all the trouble he has taken in making this Catalogue more useful than it would have been without his generous help. My thanks are due, also, to Professor Ludwig who kindly read a revise, and has suggested to me some valuable emendations in the extracts. Finally I have to thank Professor Rhys Davids to whom the initiation of this undertaking is due, for the kindly interest he has throughout taken in the work.\n\nPrague, August 1902.\n\nM.

This MS. and its relation to the MSS. of Uvata\u2019s Commentary used by Professor Max M\u00fcller in his edition and translation of the *Rgveda-Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya* have been fully discussed by Prof. Eggeling. See *Rig-Veda-Prati\u015bakhya, das \u00e4lteste Lehrbuch der vedischen Phonetik. Sanskrittext mit \u00dcbersetzung und Anmerkungen herausg. von Max M\u00fcller* (Leipzig 1869), Einleitung, pp. 22\u201432. As Prof. Eggeling states, the name of Uvata is not mentioned in this Commentary, which differs considerably from Uvata\u2019s Commentary as known to us, and probably contains an older and more authentic interpretation of the *Pr\u0101ti\u015b\u0101khya*, than that of Uvata (*l. c.*, p. 23 seq.). A complete collation of the text given by this MS., and an edition of this Commentary would be very desirable, though the MS. is unfortunately incomplete. The text breaks off after XVI, 52 in Prof. Max M\u00fcller\u2019s edition, while the Commentary only reaches to the end of the tenth Pa\u1e6dala.\n\nThe text begins:\u2014a\u1e63\u1e6dau

The name of Govind\u0101nanda is given in the colophons at the end of I, 1; II, 2; 3; 4; IV, 4, while in the colophon at the end of the first Adhy\u0101ya R\u0101m\u0101nanda, the pupil of Govind\u0101nanda, is mentioned as the author of the work. In the Berlin MS. (described by Weber-Berlin I, p. 177) P\u0101das 3 & 4 are marked by \u2018R\u0101m\u0101nandi\u2019 in the margin. According to Hall p. 89 (see also p. 202) the real author of the work is R\u0101m\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, who dedicated his work to his Guru Govind\u0101nanda. But it seems, we have to distinguish between the original Bh\u0101syaratnaprabh\u0101 by Govind\u0101nanda (as printed in the edition of the Ved\u0101nta-S\u016btras, Bibl.

At the end of the seventh we read also \u015br\u012b-Ksem\u0101nandan\u0101thaparamagurave namah, mentioning the author's guru.\n\nAccording to Burnell, Tanjore, p. 92 b the work is at least two hundred years old, as an ancient Tamil version is known. But the present MS. exhibits not the original, but a shorter compendium, the date of which is not known, probably identical with some of those cited by Aufrecht CC., p. 428 b, s. v. Mananagrantha. Of this an edition in Telugu character was printed in 1884 at the S\u0101rad\u0101nilaya press. With this edition the MS. agrees as far as the end of var\u1e47aka 7, after which the former presents a much longer and widely differing text. The opening stanza, also, is different, the MS. reading:\n\nyovatiryyeha \u0101c\u0101ryyar\u016bpe\u1e47a yatin\u0101m mude | \u015br\u012bman-n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47am vande tam harim karu\u1e47\u0101nidhi\u1e43 || manan\u0101khya\u1e43 prakarana\u1e43 v\u0101sudevayati\u015bvarai\u1e25 || racitam vistare\u1e47\u0101dy\u0101 samgrahena prak\u0101\u015byate || b\u0101l\u0101n\u0101m upak\u0101r\u0101ya mamaapi j\u00f1\u0101nasiddhaye || tatra \u015brib\u0101lagop\u0101lak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as sannihito bhavet ||\n\nIt ends:\n\niti j\u00f1\u0101tv\u0101 tat-tvam-pad\u0101div\u0101kyaj\u00f1\u0101nena parok\u1e63aj\u00f1\u0101n\u0101nu-bhaven\u0101paroksas\u0101k\u1e63atk\u0101ra\u1e47i ca yonubhavati sa candalo va br\u0101hma\u1e47o v\u0101sm\u0101kam gurur evety \u0101c\u0101ryyavacanena vij\u00f1\u0101tatatvopi vidi\u1e63\u0101sany\u0101sin\u014d mah\u0101sany\u0101sin\u0101 ca vary\u0101\u1e47 paramahamso bh\u016btv\u0101 madah\u0101(read deh\u0101)vas\u0101ne parip\u016br\u1e47a-brahmasvar\u016bpo bhavati |\n\niti manane dv\u0101da\u015ba\u1e47akam sam\u0101ptam | \u015brimin\u0101ksisundaresvar\u0101bhya\u1e47 nama\u1e25 || \u015brigurucara\u1e47\u0101ravindabhya\u1e47 nama\u1e25 ||\nThe divergence of the MS. and the edition in the last five var\u1e47akas, combined with the peculiarity in the seventh colophon of the MS., suggests that either the edition supplies the full text and not the samgraha or we have two different, possibly independent, summaries.\n\nOn the outside in European hand \u2018Mananaprakara\u1e47am\u2019.\n\n195.\n\nWHISH No. 187A.\n\nSize: \\(17\\frac{1}{4} \\times 1\\frac{1}{4}\\) in.; 19 leaves, generally 8\u20149 lines on a page.

The leaves are numbered as far as 130, though even here with troublesome erasures and corrections. As far as fol. 56 the writing is in three columns; at that point commences a rather larger hand, traversing the full width of the leaves.\n\nThe Madhyamabha\u1e45ga of the Hemak\u016b\u1e6dakha\u1e47\u1e0da of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101jasamhit\u0101 of the \u0100dimah\u0101-Pur\u0101\u1e47a.\n\nFor another MS. of this work see Ind. Off. No. 3698, pp. 1387b sqq., with which the text seems to agree closely. Thus in the opening verses sl. 4 reads \u015br\u012bva\u1e43tu, and after sudh\u0101ni\u1e63yam sl. 5 we have a mark showing that there has been a correction. The colophons also are generally in nearly literal agreement, and their disagreements (e.g. in XXXI) sometimes point in the same direction.\n\nThere are, however, considerable divergences. The Hari\u015bcandrop\u0101khy\u0101na is inserted at a different point in the two MSS., while each offers certain chapters not found in the other, according to the following scheme:\n\n| As. Soc.

Off. N\u0101gar\u012b copy, and his conjecture of hrdayasthey\u0101n (for \"stey\u0101n\") in adhy. 9. 22 is also confirmed.\n\nThe following statement gives the numbers of the pages on which the adhy\u0101yas end and the names of those not given in Dr. Eggeling's list:\n\nI 3b, II 6b, III 9a, IV 12a, V 17a, VI 19a, VII 20b, VIII 22b, IX 25a, X 26b, XI 28b, XII 29b, XIII 33a, XIV 34a, XV 36b, XVI 38a, XVII 40a, XVIII 42a, XIX 44a, XX 47a, XXI 53b, XXII 57b, XXIII 61b, XXIV 66a, XXV 70a, XXVI 75a, XXVII 80a, XXVIII 86b, XXIX 91b, XXX 96a, XXXI 102a, XXXII 107a, XXXIII 112b, XXXIV 115a, XXXV 118a, XXXVI (Kapil\u0101\u015bram\u0101d\u012bvy\u0101ghraputa(sic)t\u012brthaparyantat\u012brth\u0101ni kath\u0101nam) 123b, XXXVII (Devagha\u1e6damamrara (sic) kathana) 127a, XXXVIII (Suras\u0101sangamajalap\u0101dat\u012brthakathana) 130a, XXXIX (Manmukhat\u012brthotpatikathana (sic) 134a, XL 139b, XLI 143a, XLII 149b, XLIII 154b, XLIV 159b, XLV 162a, XLVI 167b, XLVII (imperfect) 168b.\n\nThe names of the chapters in the Hariscandrop\u0101khy\u0101na are\n\nXIX Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dh(sic)avi\u015bv\u0101mitrasanm\u0101da.\nXX Mrgay\u0101.\nXXI Va\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6dhadharmopade\u015ba.\nXXII M\u0101y\u0101var\u016bdhaprabh\u0101va.\nXXIII Hariscandra\u015braddar\u015banaro\u1e63\u0101virbh\u0101va.\nXXIV Cand\u0101lakanyak\u0101dar\u015bana.\nXXV Ka\u015bikena r\u0101j\u0101prahar\u1e47a.\nXXVI R\u0101j\u0101nnirgamana.\nXXVII M\u0101y\u0101vahnis\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di.\nXXVIII Hariscandra\u1e47a Candravat\u012bvikraya.\nXXIX Virab\u0101hudar\u015bana.\nXXX Hariscandra\u1e47a \u015bma\u015b\u0101nekh\u0101\u1e47a.\nXXXI Candravatya vi\u1e63ada\u1e63\u1e6dulohit\u0101\u015bvasan dar\u015bana.\nXXXII \u1e2aari\u015bcan\u1e0drena Ca\u1e47\u1e0dravativadha.\nXXXIII \u1e2aari\u015bcan\u1e0dravar\u0101pras\u0101dana.\n\nThe concluding lines of the MS. read thus:\u2014tata\u1e25 param tanubh\u1e5bta sidhid\u0101 brahm\u0101nirbhara\u1e25 | mahato m\u0101lavya-\ncch\u1e5b\u1e47gas te patamty u\u1e0dhasik\u0101ra\u1e25. mu (=20\u201421 of the Ind.

I (ends 2b, l. 7) K\u0101th\u0101sank\u1e63epa.\n\nII (5a, l. 7) Story of Upamanyu and birth of \u015aa\u1e45kara,\nwhich \u2018causes the books to slip from the hands of the\nDvaitav\u0101dins\u2019 (5a, l. 2.). The birthplace was in the\nKerala country (famous for the birth of Medinikara &c\n3a, l. 1), where was the Dak\u1e63inakail\u0101sa t\u012brtha, also\ncalled Sy\u0101nand\u016bra (? 3a, l. 2). Here were two rivers\nNil\u0101 (?) and C\u016br\u1e47\u012b, and on the north bank of the latter,\nat a place called K\u0101la\u1e6di, was the home of \u015a.\u2019s parents,\nwhose names are not given.\n\nIII (8a, l. 7): \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s precocity. At five years of age\nhe loses his father, and he is brought up by his mother,\nfor whose sake, when sixteen years old, he brings the\nriver near to the house. The river was thence called\nAmb\u0101pag\u0101. A crocodile seizes him while bathing,\nand in gratitude for his escape he becomes a Sa\u1e41ny\u0101sin.\n\nHe is initiated by Govindasv\u0101min, pupil of Gau\u1e0da-\np\u0101da, with whom he spends a long period. Having\nwith difficulty obtained leave, he visits t\u012brthas.\nThe friendly counsels of the guru are charmingly\nrelated.\n\nProceeding to the Badarik\u0101\u015brama, he studies Ved\u0101nta\nand composes the Bh\u0101\u1e63yapradipik\u0101. Vy\u0101sa appears\nand compliments him.\n\nIV (10a, l. 3): After his mother\u2019s death, \u015a. returns to the\nBadarik\u0101\u015brama, where the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u015barman, son\nof Soma\u015barman of \u015ariku\u1e47\u1e0dagrama in the Kera\u1e37a country, becomes his first disciple.\n\nV (12 b, l. 1): \u015a. visits Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101c\u0101rya at Pray\u0101ga. The latter, previously devoted to the karmak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, is converted to \u015a.\u2019s views. He relates that at one time, when Buddhism was triumphant (\u015bvetam\u0101rge pur\u0101 tena sugatena sub\u0101dhite), he had himself outwardly professed that religion, for which reason he is not fit to compose v\u0101rttikas on the Bh\u0101\u1e63ya. He indicates a pupil Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa, living in Magadha, as a substitute. \u015a. converts Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa from Buddhism.\n\nThe story of Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa\u2019s wife V\u0101\u1e47\u012b, daughter of Vi\u1e63\u1e47umitra, dwelling near the river Sona, shows some reminiscences of B\u0101\u1e47a\u2019s Har\u1e63acarita adhy. I.\n\nVI (14a, l. 1): Vi\u015bvar\u016bpa receives the sa\u1e41ny\u0101sa name of Sure\u015bvara. \u015aamkara composes fifteen bh\u0101\u1e63yas (ten on Upani\u1e63ads), and Sanandana (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u015barman) writes a \u1e6d\u012bk\u0101 on the Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, while Sure\u015bvara is the author of the Na\u1e45karmyasiddhi and two V\u0101rttikas. On the way to Gokarna, \u015aamkara obtains a third disciple Hast\u0101malaka (Ka\u1e45canavarnin 23b, ll. 4\u20145) at a village called \u015aivavih\u0101ra. A fourth, exceedingly devoted, was To\u1e6daka.\n\nVII (17a, l. 2): Sanandana obtains at Haridv\u0101r the name Padmap\u0101da. \u015aamkara, journeying to R\u0101masetu, bathes in the river Suvar\u1e47amukhar\u012b at K\u0101la\u1e25astik\u1e63etra, also called Daksinakail\u0101sa. Praise of K\u0101nci.\n\nVIII (20a, l. 3): \u015a. visits Pundarintapura (Pundarika 23b, l.7), where is the t\u012brtha \u015aivag\u016b\u1e45g\u0101. Then to \u015air\u0101nga: then bathes at the Dhanu\u1e63ko\u1e6dit\u012brtha at R\u0101masetu.\n\nIX (24a, l. 9): \u015a. revisits K\u0101nci and mounts the Sarvaj\u00f1a p\u012b\u1e6dha. Then to V\u1e5b\u1e63\u0101cala, where he dwells and dies at Daksinakail\u0101sa. Recapitulation in the form of an \u0101\u015birv\u0101da.\n\nThis work professes to be composed by Govindan\u0101tha, friend of \u015aamkara (23a, l. 1):\n\nidam \u015br\u012b-\u015aamkar\u0101c\u0101ryyacaritam lokap\u0101vanam\nk\u1e5btam Govindan\u0101thena yatibhaktisah\u0101yata\u1e25.\nOn the outside of fol. 24 in Whish's hand 'Samkara \u0100ch\u0101ryya charitram professing to be a history of that learned individual' and 'An unworthy work No. 79b.' See above p. 106.\n\nOther MSS. of this work have been examined by Burnell, Tanjore p. 96b\u201497a, and \u015ae\u1e63agiri \u015a\u0101stri 'Report on a Search for Sanskrit and Tamil MSS. for the year 1893\u20141894' pp. 101\u20142 and 257\u20149, the readings of which may be compared with the present. The former makes no mention of the author, but the latter accepts without question the above statement of the MS. ascribing it to Samkara's disciple Govindan\u0101tha. Although I cannot agree with Burnell's statement that the book is 'full of miracles' and the litany at the end may be an addition, it is impossible to ascribe such an antiquity to a work which cites (3a, l. 1) among the distinguished sons of the Kerala country Medinikara, apparently the author of the Medimko\u015ba.
