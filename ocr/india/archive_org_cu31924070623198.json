The total realizable land revenue, amounting to \u00a3192,907 (Rs. 19,29,070) was recovered before the close of the year ending the 31st July 1877.\n\nSeparated from the head of the Gulf of Cambay by a narrow strip of territory, the district of Kaira, with a breadth varying from about twenty-five to forty miles, stretches towards the north-east for more than sixty miles along the right bank of the river Mahi. Towards the north, from the S\u00e1barmati to the Mahi, no natural boundary line divides Kaira from Ahmedabad, the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor. On the east, south-east, and south, the river Mahi separates it from the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, Baroda, and Broach. On the south-west lies the Cambay territory, and to the west is the S\u00e1barmati with Ahmedabad beyond. To the north and east the area included within these limits forms, except for an occasional Mahi K\u00e1ntha village, a compact tract under the charge of the Collector of Kaira. But from the west a broad belt of G\u00e1ikw\u00e1ri territory passes nearly into the centre of the district, and on the south the villages of the Borsad sub-division are interlaced with those of Baroda and Cambay.\n\nThe area included in the district of Kaira is, for administrative purposes, distributed over seven sub-divisions. These, as shown in the following summary, have on an average, an area of 228 square miles, eighty-four villages, and 111,819 inhabitants.\n\nKaira Administrative details, 1877.\n\n| Name     | Area | Villages | Hamlets | Villages | Hamlets | Total | Population, 1872 | Population to the square mile | Land Revenue, 1877 |\n|----------|------|----------|---------|----------|---------|-------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Kapadvanj | 279  | 80       | 233     | 6        | 8       | 85    | 86,742           | 310.90              | 14,821            |\n| Thivra   | 255  | 92       | 126     | 1        | 6       | 3     | 92              | 35,501              | 13,334            |\n| Ahmedabad| 171  | 51       | 32      | 3        | 3       | 6     | 57              | 35,754              | 22,761            |\n| Nad\u00edd    | 218  | 78       | 55      | 6        | 6       | 1     | 68              | 99                  | 12,833            |\n| Matar    | 218  | 78       | 47      | 1        | 1       | 1     | 79              | 82                  | 76,673            |\n| Am\u00e1nd    | 241  | 73       | 47      | 1        | 1       | 1     | 74              | 149,952             | 622.20            |\n| Borsad   | 218  | 85       | 9       | 3        |         |       | 35              | 144,528             | 609.11            |\n\nTotal | 1600 | 559     | 508     | 28      | 2       | 15    | 559             | 782,733             | 489-20            | 192,907           |\n\nOf the 559 Government villages, thirty-two are in the hands of large landholders, thirty mehw\u00e1di or K\u00e9li, and two t\u00e1tukd\u00e1ri or Rajp\u00fat.\n\n* The correct spelling is Kheda.\nExcept a small corner of hilly ground near its northern boundary, and in the south-east and south, where along the Mahi the surface is roughened and furrowed into deep ravines, the district of Kaira is one unbroken plain, sloping gently towards the south-west. Though almost all fit for cultivation, the land varies much in character: In the north and north-east, with patches of rich rice land, much lies open and untilled, covered in places with little but low brushwood. In the centre is the charotar or goodly land, a tract of most fertile and well tilled soil. The people, skilful cultivators and rich, live in large well built villages. Their fields, yielding the choicest crops, are sheltered by high hedges, and the whole country is clothed with rows and clusters of large shapely trees. Westwards this belt of rich vegetation passes into a bare though well cultivated tract of riceland. This towards the south grows barrener and more open, till as it nears the Gulf of Cambay, the fields are separated by unfruitful patches, whitened by a saline deposit.\n\nThe district has two chief rivers, the Mahi for nearly 100 miles its boundary to the east and south, and on the north-west the S\u00e1barmat\u00ed, touching the district only for a few miles, but of great importance, as into it, along the channels of the Shedhi and V\u00e1trak, the whole local drainage flows.\n\nThe Mahi.\n\nThe Mahi, with a course of from 300 to 350 miles, a drainage area estimated at from 15,000 to 17,000 square miles, and a discharge during maximum flood of about one and three-quarter million cubic feet per second, is, after the Narbada and the T\u00e1pti, the largest of Gujar\u00e1t rivers. The main branch of the Mahi rises about 1850 feet above sea level in the M\u00e1lwa state of Amjhera, in north latitude 22\u00b0 32' and east longitude 75\u00b0 5', almost due east of the town of Cambay, and distant from it in a straight line about 160 miles. The source of the river is in the Mehad lake, half way between the town of Amjhera and the village of Bhop\u00e1var, near the western extremity of the Vindhya mountains, where, taking a sharp bend almost at right angles to the line of their main range, they stretch northwards to meet the Ar\u00e1vali hills. For six or seven miles the stream flows westward, then bending round Bhop\u00e1var, it takes a northerly course, parallel with the line of the northern Vindhya hills. Sunk in a deep valley between banks in places more than 100 feet high, receiving as it passes, many tributaries from the east, but none of any size from the west, for 140 miles the Mahi flows to the north till the hills of B\u00e1gar suddenly turn its stream westward. After flowing twenty-five miles to the west the high mountains of Meyw\u00e1r bend its course to the south-west, and this direction nothing in the level Gujar\u00e1t plain alters till the river falls into the Gulf of Cambay, in north latitude 22\u00b0 10', and east longitude 72\u00b0 30'.\n\nFor the first part of its Gujar\u00e1t course, the Mahi passes through the lands of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha and Rewa K\u00e1ntha chiefs. It then enters British territory, separating the district of Kaira on the right from the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and Baroda on the left. Further to the west and for the rest of its course, its right bank forms the southern boundary of the state of Cambay, and its left the northern limit of the district.\nof Broach. About 100 miles from its source, at Bungra, where it is crossed by the Baroda and Neemuch road, the bed is 400 yards wide, with a stream of 100 yards and a depth of one foot. Flowing between high, alluvial banks much cut by ravines, the hundred miles of its Kaira course may be divided into three sections, a stretch of forty miles over a rough rocky bed, then about ten miles of sand the stream unaffected by the tides, and the last forty-five miles its course as a tidal river. At Ver\u00e1kh\u00e1ndi, the limit of the flow of the tidal wave, the bed is in the dry season 500 yards wide, the stream 120, and the average depth of water a foot and a half. About thirty miles nearer the sea, where not far from the village of Dehv\u00e1n, it has reached the eastern limit of the Broach district, the river is already an estuary, five miles broad with at springs a total tidal variation of about twenty-two feet. Below Dehv\u00e1n the estuary broadens but little, the distance across its mouth from Cambay to K\u00e1vi being estimated at about five miles. Here the extreme tidal variations are not less than thirty feet. This added to the funnel-like shape of the head of the gulf, forces the tidal waters into a wave. At neap tides the water ebbs and flows with no marked disturbance. But at springs, especially at the night spring tide, about five miles below Cambay soon after the flood has set in, two waves rise on the shallows on either side of the channel, and swollen by the quickening tide and narrowing space stretch outwards till they meet in midchannel. At ten miles an hour, past sloping shallows in a crescent-like curve, and through steep banks in a straight six feet high wall-like line, the bore, crested and raging, rushes for twenty miles till it is broken and spent on the Dehv\u00e1n sands.\n\nThough during the rains it fills its broad bed from bank to bank with, where the sides are high, a depth of over forty feet, in the fair season, within the limits of the Kaira district, the Mahi can be crossed in many places. Of these the chief fords are at the mouth of the river between Cambay and K\u00e1vi, on account of the rush of water, always a dangerous crossing, though at the lowest tides it can be passed on foot. Thirteen miles above Cambay is the Dehv\u00e1n ford, available only at neap tides. Five miles further at Gajna is another\n\n---\n\n1 Five miles is the Revenue Survey measure. Thornton gives three kos, or four and a half miles. Hove (1787) gives six kos, or nine miles.\n\n2 Ethersey's Cambay Survey 1837, J. R. Geog. Soc. 8, 196-202. The 'bore' is thus described by the author of the Periplus (about A.D. 160). Especially is there risk when the new moon falls in conjunction with the night tide, for then, when the sea is perfectly calm, you shall hear in a moment a rushing sound like the tumult of battle, and the water driving forward with the utmost impetuosity covers the whole of the bare shoals in an instant.'\u2014Vincent's Periplus, II., 261.\n\n3 The following were (1827) the details of this crossing approached from the south. After descending the bank at K\u00e1reli for the first three miles, the road leads over a hard flat only covered at the highest tides. The principal stream is then crossed about a furlong wide, and at the highest of the neap tides not more than three feet deep. The road next passes over a broad, sandy, and somewhat muddy island; and beyond the island, through a minor stream scarcely ankle deep, ascends the steep bank at the village of Dehv\u00e1n. In the fair season, except for six days before and after the new and full moon, when the overflow of the spring tides leaves it muddy, the river bed is hard, and any description of carriage can be taken across without trouble.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., XI., 88.\ncrossing serviceable except at the highest springs and free from any dangerous rush of tide. Ten miles beyond, at the Kh\u00e1npur village, in the hot weather the river can be forded, and at other seasons carts pass easily on poles laid across two boats. Two miles beyond, close to the railway bridge, is the Om\u00e9ta ford, the best of the Mahi crossings. The fierceness of the tidal wave makes the mouth of the Mahi dangerous for any but flat bottomed boats. And though it is said that, in former times, the village of Dehv\u00e1n was a port of some consequence, the channel is not at present deep enough to admit vessels of any size. The high rugged banks of the Mahi prevent its waters being used for irrigation, and so deep is its bed that it drains rather than feeds the springs near its banks.\n\nFour places on the Mahi, Mingrad, Fazilpur, Angad, and Yasipur, are held specially sacred by the Kolis, and visited by pilgrims on the 15th of Chaitra (April). The Kolis think of the Mahi as their mother. They swear by her, and though they have little fear in breaking their oath, they believe that if it is given him to drink a guilty person will fail to swallow the water of the Mahi. This happens more particularly if the water is given him at V\u00e1sna Kolna, where on the night of the Dasera festival (October), the Kolis used to meet and organize their predatory forays. Though like other streams it is considered sacred, fear would seem to be the prevailing feeling in the worship of the Mahi. The height of its banks and the fierceness of its floods, the deep gullies through which the traveller has to pass on his way to the river, and perhaps, above all, the bad name of the tribes on its northern bank, explain the proverb, 'When the Mahi is crossed, there is safety.'\n\nA detailed description of the S\u00e1barmati, the fourth river in Gujar\u00e1t, will be found in the Ahmedabad Statistical Account. During the fourteen miles of its course along the western limit of the Kaira district its waters are largely used for irrigation.\n\nThe Shedhi.\n\nThe chief drainage line of the plain between the Mahi and the S\u00e1barmati is the river Shedhi. This stream, rising at the Damodi hill in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, enters the north-east corner of the Kaira district within two miles of the Mahi. Passing west through the Th\u00e1sra sub-division it is joined from the right by the Suidak river, and further on near the centre of the district about eight miles north of Nadi\u00e1d, it receives the Mohar from the north. Then flowing west, on the right just before entering the town of Kaira, it is joined by the Mul Kh\u00e1ri. Beyond Kaira it meets the V\u00e1trak from the north-west, and together they wind south-west into the S\u00e1barmati. A narrow quick-flowing stream its banks steep, and in many parts its bed rather deep in mud, the Shedhi is at all times hard to cross. Sweet and good when it enters the district after meeting the Mohar its water is charged with soda, and being found hurtful to the crops, is little used for watering. Except for a mile or two above its meeting with the V\u00e1trak during the hot season the bed of the Shedhi is dry. Its tributaries all join it from the right. The first is the Suidak in the Th\u00e1sra sub-division, flowing with an unfailing stream from Hath-v\u00e1r in the B\u00e1lasinor territory. Next near the centre of the district,\ncomes the Mohar. This stream, rising in the Virpur sub-division of the B\u00e1lasinor territory, enters the Kaira district in the extreme north, and near the town of Kapadvanj, meeting the Var\u00e1si from Bariar in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha, flows south for about twenty miles. Here from the east it is joined by the Loni, and after passing five miles to the south-west, falls into the Shedhi. So impregnated with soda is the Mohar, that after it joins the Shedhi the waters of that river cannot be used for irrigation. The Mul Kh\u00e1ri, the next of the Shedhi\u2019s tributaries, after draining the lowlying land between the town of Mahudha and the junction of the Mohar and Shedhi, falls into the main stream close to the east of Kaira. The V\u00e1trak, with which the waters of the Shedhi unite at Kaira, rises near the town of Satuman in Meyw\u00e1r, and flows through the lands of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha and the Par\u00e1ntij sub-division of Ahmedabad. Five miles above Kaira it receives the Meshvo, a stream that a little to the west has throughout its whole course run almost parallel to the V\u00e1trak. Then at Kaira, joining the Shedhi from the east with a winding course, they flow south falling into the S\u00e1barmati at Vautha, a place of great sanctity. During its forty miles course through the Kaira district, the V\u00e1trak, between alluvial banks about twenty feet high and with a shallow unfailing stream, flows over a bed of sand about 150 feet broad. By the help of lifts its water is much used in irrigation.\n\nThe Kh\u00e1ri, rising in a cluster of hills about ten miles to the northeast of Ahmednagar in the Idar state, passes through a few villages in the extreme west of Kaira, and falls into the S\u00e1barmati to the north-west of the village of Radu, a little above the meeting of the S\u00e1barmati and V\u00e1trak. The land here is very flat, and during the rains is subject to flooding. Here, for more than a century, rice fields have been watered by banks thrown across the river. At first the embankments were of earth and wanted constant repair. And it is only since 1850 that at a total cost of \u00a36600 (Rs. 66,000) permanent masonry dams with sluice gates have been built. These, seventeen in number, command an area of 11,000 acres in eleven villages. Formerly the right to the Kh\u00e1ri water was among the villagers on its banks the source of constant quarrels. But in 1843 and again in 1874, the rights have been settled and the water more fairly distributed. The Kh\u00e1ri stream generally fails at the end of the rice season (November). The water could be brought from the H\u00e1thmati river by the H\u00e1thmati canal and along the Bujva, a tributary of the Kh\u00e1ri. But much of the land that would gain by this increased supply is alienated, and at present there is no way of recovering a watercess from the lands of the alienees.\u00b9\n\nThough its average yearly rainfall is not more than thirty inches, the district of Kaira has, since the earliest years of English management, been liable to suffer from floods. This has specially been the case in two lowlying tracts. In the west where, between the Shedhi\n\n\u00b9 Between 1869 and 1874 the irrigated area of Government land increased from 3694 to 4737 acres and the land revenue from \u00a32900 to \u00a33447 (Rs. 23,000\u201434,470).\u2014Irrigation Revenue Report, 1876-77, 18-24.\nand the S\u00e1barmati, M\u00e1tar stretches an almost level plain, and in the south-west and south where the southern lands of Nadi\u00e1d, Petl\u00e1d, and the north of Borsad are at times swamped by the flood waters from the raised tract along the right bank of the Mahi.\\(^1\\) Though with no marked courses the flood waters of the Kaira lowlands set along three chief lines, west into the V\u00e1trak, south-west into the Alang canal,\\(^2\\) and south by the Chor ravine into the Mahi. The floods that drain westwards, gathering head in Durn\u00e1l, Ker\u00ed\u00e1vi, and A'khdiol in southern Nadi\u00e1d, through Petl\u00e1d and M\u00e1tar pass westwards into the V\u00e1trak about two miles above its meeting with the S\u00e1barmati.\n\nOf the waters that make their way to the Alang canal, two of small size pass through the southern villages of M\u00e1tar, entering the canal about ten or twelve miles to the north-west of Cambay. The third, a much larger body of water collecting in the southern villages of the Th\u00e1sra sub-division flows past Umreth, and then westwards to Chakl\u00e1si about six miles south-east of Nadi\u00e1d. From Chakl\u00e1si, setting more to the south, it floods the lowlying lands of B\u00e1krol and Karamsad, and crossing Petl\u00e1d and Cambay, after a course of more than forty miles, spreads over the R\u00e1npur flats and makes its way into the Alang canal about three and half miles to the north of Cambay. The flood waters that find their way into the Chor ravine set along three chief lines, one from Sandesar, about eight miles south-west of A'nand; a second from Mogri, about four miles east of Sandesar; and a third from S\u00e1rsa, about eight miles east of Mogri. The Sandesar water, making head in the lowlying lands of that village, flows south-west for about eighteen miles, entering the Chor ravine at Karamsal, about two miles from its mouth. The second, though called after the village of Mogri, makes head at Chikhodra about six miles further east, and keeping to the north of Borsad, passes south-west, falling into the Chor ravine at K\u00e1ndhreti about three miles above Karamsal; the S\u00e1rsa water, passing through A'r\u00e1\u015b and to the south of Borsad, joins the Mogri flood at Uneli, about six miles above K\u00e1ndhreti.\n\nDuring the period of heavy rainfall between 1814 and 1822 floods and standing water caused much damage.\\(^3\\) Flood remissions and sums for cutting or clearing drains were from time to time granted. But chiefly from the interlacing of Cambay and Baroda villages and the difficulty of getting their managers to work in concert, no systematic attempt would seem to have been made to improve the drainage before the early survey of the district between 1820 and 1827. Captain Cruikshank, in his N\u00e1p\u00e1d report (1826), describes\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A drainage map is given at the end of this chapter.\n\n\\(^2\\) This canal, about twenty-five miles long, was cut to bring the water of the S\u00e1barmati to the N\u00e1r\u00e1yansar lake at Cambay. This lake is now (1876) dry.\n\n\\(^3\\) In 1819 several villages were entirely under water, one of them, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r village of Vaso, yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000). Captain Robertson, the Collector, had a drain dug to the V\u00e1trak river. He suggested that an officer should be sent to survey the chief natural drainage lines, and complained of the great difficulty he found in getting the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and Cambay courts to agree to any scheme for the common good.\u2014Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec., 149 of 1820, 491. In western Borsad, in 1824, drains were said to be wanted to carry off the water that lodged and destroyed the land.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., XI., 92.\nthe general drainage of the district. In that part of the country serious loss from floods would seem to have been only occasional, and Captain Cruikshank did not advise the undertaking of any large drainage scheme. He thought that enough would be done if, in times of flood, care was taken to cut temporary channels from village to village, and to see that the passage of the flood waters was in no way checked or turned aside.\\(^1\\) In M\u00e1tar, Captain Cruikshank would seem to have found the evils resulting from flooding more pressing.\\(^2\\) With the help of the headmen of several villages he prepared a scheme for the drainage of most of its chief villages. According to his estimates, at a total cost of \u00a3980 (Rs. 9800), of which \u00a3320 (Rs. 3200) would be met by the villagers, land capable of yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a31131 (Rs. 11,310) might be saved. These proposals were approved by Government in 1828. But on account of the inability of the people of several villages to pay their contributions, and the objections raised by the Baroda and Cambay authorities to let drains pass through their lands, nothing was done till in 1830 (October 15) Sir John Malcolm took the matter in hand, strongly supporting Captain Cruikshank\u2019s scheme on the ground, not only of the increase of revenue, but because of the gain to public health and the protection to cattle likely to ensue.\\(^3\\) In 1831, a survey was carried out by Mr. Jordan. This showed that for an outlay by Government of \u00a31212 (Rs. 12,120) 2528 acres (4304 bigh\u00e1s) of land might be saved from flooding. Government approved Mr. Jordan\u2019s proposals, and ordered his scheme to be carried out without delay.\\(^4\\) The work was earnestly taken up, and during eleven years, continued to be vigorously pushed on. At the end of that time (1842), fourteen sets of drains had been completed, at a cost of about \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000). Of the fourteen works, one was in the north between Mehmadabad and Mahudha; eight were in the west, draining into the V\u00e1trak; four were in the south-west, draining into the Alang canal; and one in the south, draining into the Chor ravine. The northern work, in two parts, one protecting the villages of Rudan and Karoli, the other those of Bhumas and Khutaj, was finished in 1837, at a cost of \u00a3296 (Rs. 2960). Of the eight western works, one\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) After Captain Cruikshank\u2019s survey came several seasons of unusually heavy rainfall. In 1829 the villages of Karamsad and B\u00e1krol were most seriously flooded, and owing to a bank raised by the villagers of Val\u00e1son to the west, the flood waters could not pass off. So much harm was done that from Karamsad and B\u00e1krol, a company 500 strong went out to clear off the dam. Val\u00e1son resisted, and the struggle lasted for three days, with a loss of from twelve to fifteen men. Again, between 1836 and 1838 much damage was done. In Sandesar near Karamsad, for four successive years the rice crops were totally destroyed; and in one of those years a great part of the village of Karamsad was swept away, with a loss estimated at \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000).\u2014Kaira Executive Engineer\u2019s drainage report, 234, 22nd October 1866.\n\n\\(^2\\) Captain Cruikshank\u2019s report, prepared in 1827, has not been traced.

The remaining seven united in draining western Nadi\u00e1d and central M\u00e1tar into the V\u00e1trak, about twelve miles below Kaira. Of these, one finished in 1832 (March 8th) at a cost of \u00a3118 (Rs. 1180), relieved Undhela and M\u00e1tar; the second finished in 1833 (January 31st) at a cost of \u00a3128 (Rs. 1280), relieved Heranj, M\u00e1chhial, and Tr\u00e1j; the third finished in 1833 (January 31st) at a cost of \u00a3193 (Rs. 1930), drained the western villages of Kh\u00e1ndli, Kathoda, Tr\u00e1nja, Mar\u00e1la, and Pun\u00e1j; the fourth finished in 1841 (June 15th) at a cost of \u00a3699 (Rs. 6990), drained the Petl\u00e1d villages of Pij and Vaso, and the M\u00e1tar villages of Mali\u00e1taj and Lav\u00e1l; the fifth finished in 1842 (April 14th) at a cost of \u00a370 (Rs. 700), drained B\u00e1mnoli, Dant\u00e1li, and Davra; the sixth finished in 1842 (March and April) at a cost of \u00a356 (Rs. 560), drained Dumr\u00e1l, Pipleta, and Keri\u00e1vi; and the seventh finished in 1842 (April 30th) at a cost of \u00a336 (Rs. 360), drained Mitr\u00e1l and \u00c1'khbdol.\n\nOf the three that protected the south-west, one finished in 1837 (June 12th) at a cost of \u00a3222 (Rs. 2220), brought the flood waters of the south M\u00e1tar villages of Moraj and Chikhlia into the Alang canal, about twelve miles north-west of Cambay. The other two forming together the great Karamsad drain, entered the Alang canal, about three and a half miles from Cambay. The chief of these two works finished in 1838 (November 18th) at a cost of \u00a31092 (Rs. 10,920), starting from the village of Karamsad, four miles west of \u00c1'nand, passed through P\u00e1laj, A'mod, N\u00e1r, and Bhanderaj, a distance of about twenty miles. The other work, a feeder to this great drain, finished in 1839 (June 15th) at a cost of \u00a3253 (Rs. 2530), relieved the villages of Narsanda, Vadt\u00e1li, R\u00e1h\u00e1vli, and B\u00e1ndhni. The southern line was the Mogri drain, finished in 1840 (May 30th) at a cost of \u00a381 (Rs. 810). This passing through N\u00e1h\u00e1pa, Santokpura, Boch\u00e1san, Uneli, Sahijpur, and V\u00e1sna, entered the Chor ravine at Karamsal. Two villages, Bori\u00e1vi about five miles north of \u00c1'nand, and Sangesar about two miles south of Karamsad, were left unprotected. Plans were prepared for draining Bori\u00e1vi south to B\u00e1kr\u00f3l, and Sangesar south to Karamsal, in the Chor ravine. But in both cases the Baroda and Cambay authorities, through some of whose villages the flood waters would have to pass, raised objections and the question of making those drains was laid aside. In reviewing, in 1843, the results of this drainage system, the Collector, Mr. Kirkland, showed that while the whole cost of the works was \u00a34000 (Rs. 40,000), during the five years ending with 1841 about one-half of this amount had been saved by making remissions of land revenue unnecessary. Besides this saving to Government, there was the great gain to villagers, and a marked improvement in the public health. Government agreed that the result was satisfactory. They thanked Mr. Kirkland for the interest he had shown in planning and supervising the works, and Messrs. Jordan and Spry for their\n\n1 Collector, 2612, August 10th, 1843.\nvaluable services in constructing them. So great relief did these canals bring, that in 1842 several smaller cuts, already surveyed and sanctioned, were found to be unnecessary. The rejected lines were, in the east, three feeders to the Karamsad grand drain from Chaklasi to the north, Chikhodra to the east, and A'nd to the south of Karamsad, and along this same drain about half way to the Alang canal at the village Silvai, a branch from the right bringing the flood waters of Balitva, Changa, Melav, and Pipla. In the south a cut from Pandoli, Khadma, and Shahpur, in Borsad, to fall into the Mahi to the west of Cambay. In the west, in southern Matar, a cut passing through Bantva, Pariaj, and Bamangam, into the Alang canal. The arrangements for relieving Karamsad and Bakrol failed. The original canal was about eight feet above the proper level, and the second drain, by way of Jol, through raised sandy ground, was very soon filled with drift, that only in the very highest floods was the water able to pass off. With this exception all the lines worked well.\n\nFor several years little care was taken of the drains, and nothing was done in the way of repairs. And after about fourteen years, partly from their bad state of repair and partly from two or three seasons of unusually heavy rainfall, complaints of loss from flooding again became common. According, in 1858, Mr. Spry, to whom along with Mr. Jordan the success of the works finished between 1831 and 1842 was due, was deputed to 'survey and determine the different lines of drainage.' Though Mr. Spry's report was useful as showing the position of the lands liable to flooding, and the lines of natural drainage, it contained no details or estimates of works. In 1862 Colonel Prescott, in his survey report on Matar, renewed complaints of the damage done by the bad state of the drains, and suggested that the whole subject should be inquired into, and the canals made use of for irrigation. For several years no officer was available for special drainage duty, and it was not till the close of 1865 that the work was again taken up. Between November of that year, and August of 1866, Lieutenant Baldwin surveyed the greater part of the Kaira low lands. His main drainage lines differed but little from those laid down by Mr. Jordan. He proposed to extend the feeders of the chief west line to Barijan and Piplaj, south of Nadiad. Of the south-western line, he would continue that through Pariaj and Bamangam across the Petlad lands to Dehmol, six miles from Vadtal. He would cut an additional channel crossing from Pariaj in south Matar to Sojitra, six miles north-west of Petlad. The Karamsad line he did not propose to change. But he added the cut from Pandoli and\n\n---\n\n1 In 1856 the Collector complained that near Nadiad, to get to their fields, cultivators had, with their ploughs on their heads, to wade through mud and water higher than a man's breast. From other villages reports came that women were drowned, and that the streets were dangerous from alligators crawling about.\u2014Collector 168, 11th April 1854.\n\n2 In 1862 Colonel Prescott wrote, 'the Matar drains carried out between 1831 and 1840, made the district healthier, raised the revenue, made remissions less necessary, and helped the cultivators to accumulate wealth.' Again he says 'the Matar people are unanimous in dating the time from which the district began to grow prosperous from its drainage by Mr. Jordan.'\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., New Series, CXIV., 416, 421.\nDanteli into the Alang canal, about a mile north-west of Cambay, formerly surveyed, but rejected as unnecessary. His southern or Chor ravine drainage lines are the Sandesar, the Mogri, and the S\u00e1rsa, the same as Mr. Jordan\u2019s. For the three lines passing through the M\u00e1tar sub-division, Mr. Baldwin was unable to prepare projects. Like Mr. Jordan, he thought the villages along the S\u00e1rsa branch of the Mogri drain wanted no special protection. For the improvement of the three remaining lines, he proposed for Karamsad, a canal about twenty-eight miles long with a drainage area of about 141 miles, and an estimated cost of \u00a37855 (Rs. 78,550); for Sandesar, a canal about seventeen miles long with a drainage area of about fifty-four miles, and an estimated cost of \u00a39237 (Rs. 92,370); and for Mogri, a canal about twenty miles long with a drainage area of about 150 miles, and an estimated cost of \u00a37056 (Rs. 70,560).\n\nThe four years before Mr. Baldwin\u2019s survey had been seasons of very evenly distributed rainfall. Little loss had been caused by floods, and the people showed small interest in the proposed drainage. After his survey was completed in August 1866, the district was visited by a very heavy flood. Mr. Baldwin took advantage of the opportunity to test the accuracy of his measurements. Of the effect of this storm he has left the following details:\u2014In twenty-four hours (August 3, 1866) from 4:50 to 5:50 inches of rain fell. At Chikhodra, about two and a half miles east of A\u2019nand, where the Mogri and Chor water first makes head, the flood was about four feet higher than was good for the land, and was destroying some hundred acres of rice. A\u2019nand, though in the middle of a lake, was unhurt; only waste lands were covered. Mogri looked flooded, but the people said the water was not too high. Instead of draining into the Mogri cutting, a strong head of water was setting west for Karamsad. In Karamsad though the flood was doing great harm, it was, the people said, only eighteen inches too high. A little of the flood was passing north to B\u00e1krol, but just as much was rolling in from A\u2019nand. At Sandesar the water stood four and a half feet too deep; and at B\u00e1krol great damage was done. Jol was safe, the flood running off along the old cut.\n\nIn forwarding his projects to Government, Mr. Baldwin complained that he found the old drains greatly in want of looking after. Hedges were planted across them in some places, and in others, to water a field, the channel had been blocked up. Compared with the former drains, Mr. Baldwin trusted that his canals would prove to have more even slopes, and fewer windings. Again, he thought it a great advance that instead of carrying them through he had cut his drains along the feeding sides of ponds and reservoirs. The proposal to make the drainage canals into irrigation channels was not approved. But, except the sluices and bridges, the Mogri scheme was sanctioned, and a sum of \u00a34278 (Rs. 42,780) spent in cutting the canal. The drain has worked well. But since its construction no attempt has been made to carry out either the Karamsad or Singsi projects. It has, on the whole, been a time of rather short rainfall with no great damage from floods. The district officers, while admitting that the Mogri drain has done all that it was expected\nto do, doubt if the advantage gained is worth the sum spent. In Borsad, in Colonel Prescott's opinion (1867), the damage by floods was so slight, and the loss to the early crops was so generally followed by a better late harvest, that this liability formed no ground for reducing the survey rates. Again in 1868 Mr. Elliot the Collector wrote that both because they were unnecessary and on account of the large quantity of land they would occupy, the other schemes should not, in his opinion, be carried out. Mr. Little the Executive Engineer agreed with this view, doubting if the good done by such canals is equal to the cost of cutting them. On these grounds, while ordering that care should be taken to keep all the channels clear and in order, Government have decided that for the present the other projects should not be carried out.\n\nBesides the smaller floods mentioned under the head of drainage, three specially severe storms visited Kaira, one in 1837, a second in 1868, and a third in 1871. In 1837 after two days (the 28th and 29th August) of average rainfall, on the evening of the 30th, a storm burst with heavy thunder and wind. The flood continued to rise till nine in the evening of the 31st. The waters kept at their extreme height for about an hour and then slowly fell. Near the town of Kaira, the Shedhi and V\u00e1trak uniting, rose till they covered the whole country for miles. From the 31st August to the 2nd September, between the Collector's house and the town, a stream ran too deep to be crossed. At this time the water stood waist high on the steps of the rest-house near the library, and flowed over the Ratanpur bridge. It rose to four of the town gates, the L\u00e1l, the Ahmedabad, the Pura, and the B\u00e1lapir, leaving at B\u00e1lapir gate only four feet of the arch open, and flooding about thirty-five houses inside. Opposite this gate, and at a small distance on the further bank of a water-course, stands the hamlet of Lakhmipura. In this village of 125 houses, only thirty were left standing. Of the people, one hundred were saved in a boat, and the rest by climbing from tree to tree. This flood is said to have been due to a very unusual rise in the rivers above the Kaira district rather than to the excess of the local rainfall. In the whole district the lands of eighty-six villages were flooded, twenty-one in Nadi\u00e1d, twenty-one in M\u00e1tar, fifteen in Mahudha, ten in Borsad, eight in Th\u00e1sra, and five in Kapadvanj. No lives were lost. But besides huts, 409 houses in the town of Kaira were destroyed. The lately completed drains were most useful in relieving the district of the flood waters. In M\u00e1tar they prevented immense loss, both in houses and lands, and in Mahudha were of eminent service.\n\nBetween the 9th and 13th August 1868, with much wind, 22\u00b74 inches of rain fell. On the 12th, the V\u00e1trak rose rapidly; and in the morning of the 13th, both the V\u00e1trak and the Shedhi overflowed.\n\n---\n\n1 In the great flood of August 9, 1868, the Mogri canal did great service, very rapidly relieving the lands near Borsad of their flood waters.\u2014Collector, 875, September 11, 1868.\n2 Collector, 1156, November 28, 1868.\n3 Gov.

On the walls of the library in the low land south of the town, the water stood five feet two inches deep. In the town one child, a Parsi, was drowned, and 395 houses, nine of the first, seventy-two of the second, and 314 of the third class, were destroyed. In the rest of the district the lives of three human beings and of thirteen cattle were lost; and 1960 houses, 104 two-storied, 736 one-storied, and 1220 huts destroyed. Railway traffic was stopped for more than a fortnight. But the public works suffered but slightly. As far as an estimate could be framed, the total amount of damage done was calculated at \u00a313,858 (Rs. 1,38,580). To help the destitute, Government sanctioned the expenditure of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), and a further advance of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) was made to the Kaira municipalities. An additional sum of \u00a3511 (Rs. 5110) was raised in Bombay and forwarded to the Collector of Kaira. But the people were unwilling to take charity, and the money was spent in improving ponds and wells. Of five of the villages that suffered most, the sites were changed. Land revenue to the amount of \u00a3752 (Rs. 7520) was remitted, free grants of limestone, of clay for bricks, and in some cases of wood were made, and at a total cost of \u00a329,672 (Rs. 2,96,720) relief works were kept open from the beginning of August to the end of May.\n\nOn the 2nd August 1871, a storm broke over the district with a fierce south-west wind and rain, varying in twenty-four hours from 3\u00b750 inches in Th\u00e1sra to 11\u00b741 inches in M\u00e1tar, and averaging 7\u00b772 inches over the whole district. Round the town of Kaira the country was flooded for miles. The water hid even the highest hedges, and at the town of Kaira stood from sixteen to eighteen inches higher than in 1868. The 3rd and 4th August were rough, wet days, followed on the 5th by a severe gale, and heavy rain from the southwest. The flood was felt most severely in the Mehmadabad and M\u00e1tar villages. For four days (2nd to 5th August) at Kaira the Collector's office was cut off from the town and the road between Mehmadabad and Kaira was impassable. A railway bridge was washed away and some telegraph wires destroyed; otherwise the damage to the public works of the district was small. Except the camp road, the Executive Engineer estimated that all loss might be covered by adding \u00a3250 (Rs. 2500) to the repair estimates. Though in several villages the whole population lived for nearly two days and nights in trees, only five persons and 799 cattle were drowned and 4984 houses, 276 of them in the town of Kaira, destroyed. The loss of property was calculated at \u00a325,031 (Rs. 2,50,310). The distress, considerable in some villages, was almost entirely relieved by private charity. The Kaira grain fund committee, without giving general and ill-judged alms, brought most liberal help, distributing from \u00a370 to \u00a380 (Rs. 700-800) worth of grain. Cases of distress, unsuited for private relief, were\n\n---\n\n1 The details are, Government, Rs. 70,356; villagers (in cash and labour), Rs. 10,906; and Local Funds, Rs. 215,458.\n\n2 The details are, Th\u00e1sra, 3\u00b750; \u00c1'hand, 9\u00b775; Nadi\u00e1d, 8\u00b711; Borsad, 7; Melim\u00e1dbad, 6\u00b74; Kapadvanj, 6\u00b785; M\u00e1tar, 11\u00b741; and Kaira, 8\u00b776.\nmet by Government advances, amounting altogether to a sum of \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000).\u00b9\n\nThe district contains no natural lakes, but according to the statistics of 1871-72, is supplied with 4079 ponds or reservoirs, covering a total area of 14,553 acres, or on an average of four acres to each reservoir. Of the total number, two only, the Gomti lake at D\u00e1kor and the village reservoir of Bel\u00e1ra in the M\u00e1tar sub-division, are of any great size. As most of them are dry or very low in the hot season, they are of little use for perennial crops; but in October and November, after the rains are over, they are very serviceable for watering rice. Except in parts of the Kapadvanj and Th\u00e1sra sub-divisions, where the land is impregnated with soda, the district is well supplied with wells, ponds, and rivers of sweet water. Besides the ponds mentioned above, 545 water-lifts or dhekuris, and the unbuilt wells in alluvial lands, there were 227 wells with, and 10,076 wells without steps.\n\nGeologically the Kaira plain is, with the exception of the few sandy hills and rocks in Kapadvanj and Th\u00e1sra, a deep bed of flint and lime alluvium, most of it d\u00e9bris of the felspathic and limestone rocks of the Ar\u00e1vali hills. In the raised tract, along the banks of the Mahi, water is found only at a depth of from eighty to 110 feet. Away from the river, wells have their springs from forty to sixty feet deep, rising through strata of earth mixed with limestone nodules, alternating with sand overlying sheet limestone. From this limestone, when tapped, water rises to within twenty-five feet of the surface. Formerly, in parts of the district, water was to be found higher even than this. Many old wells are said to have been made useless by the earthquake of 1819, which lowered all the springs from five to ten cubits.\u00b2 In some cases deeper sinking has overcome the evil, in others, a fine stratum of quicksand makes further cutting dangerous. The hot springs of Lasundra, ten miles south-east of Kapadvanj, rise to the surface in ten or twelve cisterns, the hottest standing at a temperature of 115\u00b0. Like those at Tua in Godhra, twenty miles to the south-east, and at An\u00e1val, 150 miles south, the Lasundra springs are slightly sulphureous, and thought to be useful in skin diseases.\n\nTo Europeans, though with some constitutions it agrees well, the climate is trying. From November to March the air is pleasant and bracing. But even this long share of cool weather fails to make up for the severe heat of the rest of the year, dry and parching in March, April, and May; moist and oppressive from June to October. To the people of the country, except in the eastern sub-divisions of Kapadvanj and Th\u00e1sra, and on the north-west, in the marshy rice-bearing lands near the Kh\u00e1ri river, the climate is not hurtful; and the central tract, known as the charotar, is considered healthy.

During the cold season, as the air becomes dryer, sickness gradually grows less, and in the hot weather months public health is at its best. From March to October the general direction of the wind is from the south-west, and from November to February from the north-east. From 1852 to 1861, the average rainfall was 33\\(^{78}\\) inches; from 1862 to 1871, the corresponding returns give 27\\(^{45}\\) inches; and from 1872 to 1877, 28\\(^{10}\\) inches.\\(^2\\) Except an occasional shower in the cold season, the whole rain supply falls between June and October. Thermometrical readings registered during the ten years ending with 1861 vary from 104\\(^{1}\\) in May to 54\\(^{6}\\) in January. They give for the whole period an average mean temperature of 79\\(^{6}\\).\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In 1876, Nadiad suffered from a severe attack of cholera.\n\n\\(^2\\) Sanitary Commissioner's report of 1873, 45, 46.

With this exception the district is without minerals. In the bed of the M\u00e1jam river, about fifteen miles from Kapadvanj, are found some varieties of agate and moss pebbles. These known as kh\u00e1riyu, \u00e1giya, and r\u00e1tadiu, are, when polished, among the most valued of Cambay stones. At Kapadvanj the business of collecting them is almost entirely in the hands of merchants of the class of Shia Bohoras. Labourers are employed by them to search the bed of the stream and quarry its banks. The best season for finding the stones is at the close of the rains, when numbers are washed out of the mud and gravel of the banks and bed. When a supply of stones has been collected they are baked. And those that stand the fire, and develope bright colours, are sent to Cambay to be polished.\u00b9 In the bed of the river Mahi are masses and boulders of trap, and in the east, near where it enters the district, rock is plentiful, including trap with occasional limestone, quartz, and granite. Though not suited for building purposes this rock is used for road metal. Limestone, kankar, in small nodules is found in and near most of the Kaira rivers. Its quality varies, but it usually contains from fifty to seventy-five per cent of carbonate of lime besides sand and sometimes clay and magnesia. Sand used for making mortar is found in the rivers Mahi, Vatrak, and Meshvo, and in the smaller water-courses. In low broken ground near Kapadvanj, Lasundra, Torna, and other villages in the north-east of the district, a white crust of impure carbonate of soda forms on the surface of the ground. This earth is collected and much used in making glass and soap and as a mordant in dyeing cloth.\u00b2\n\nKaira is generally spoken of as one of the best wooded parts of the Bombay Presidency. This in one sense is true. At the same time the district has no forests or forest land,\u00b3 the trees either standing singly or in small groves. Especially in the southern\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Forbes (Or. Mom. III., 68) makes Kapadvanj the site of Ptolemy's (150) mountain of agates. But it seems more likely that Ptolemy heard of the mine on the R\u00e1jpipla hills, since known as B\u00e9dva Ghor. Details of the mining and manufacture of Cambay stones are given in the Cambay statistical account.\n\u00b2 Contributed by T. D. Little, Esq., C.E., District Executive Engineer.\n\u00b3 In the Borsad sub-division, during the rains of 1867, 1256 acres of land were sown with babul, Acacia Arabica. The seed germinated, but after growing a few inches high the plants withered.\u2014Forest Report, 1867-68.\nparts the timber is found in the hedge rows with here and there in the fields a well grown solitary tree. In the north, the mahuda, Bassia latifolia, and in the south, the mango and the limbdo, Melia azadirachta, are the commonest varieties. All over the district the custard-apple, shittaphal, Anona squamosa, is abundant, in some places bearing good fruit, though apparently growing wild. Besides these, the r\u0101yan, Mimusops indica, the kanaj, Ulmus integrifolia, the karanj or kaniyi, Pongamia glabra, and the aduso, Ailanthus excelsa, are freely distributed over almost the whole of the district. The fruit of the mango is in considerable quantities sent to Baroda, Ahmedabad, and K\u0101thi\u0101war. During the hot season the fleshy corolla of the mahuda flower is eaten by the poor and by cattle, and from it is distilled a favourite native liquor. Mixed with whey the berries of the r\u0101yan, Mimusops indica, form during the hot season the staple food of a large section of the Koli population.\n\nThe chief domestic animals of the district are oxen, cows, buffaloes, sheep and goats, horses, camels, and asses. Of oxen, the 1876-77 returns show a total of 128,247 head. A few of the finest, worth from \u00a315 to \u00a330 (Rs. 150-300) the pair, owned by well-to-do Kanbi cultivators, are brought from K\u0101thi\u0101war and K\u0101nkrej in northern Gujar\u0101t. But some of the largest are bred in the district, Bh\u0101laj and other villages of the Nadi\u0101d sub-division being famous for their bullocks. The poorer cultivators have smaller, leaner, and less valuable cattle, worth from \u00a33 to \u00a310 (Rs. 30-100) a pair. But except in Th\u0101sra and Kapadvanj, where they are small and in poor condition, the Kaira cattle are on the whole large and fine animals. Among cultivators the common practice is to buy and rear calves. Besides a full supply of grass and millet stalks, the rich man\u2019s bullocks have every day a pound or two of bruised oil seeds, and from four to six pounds of pulse.\u00b9 Except in the busy season (June-November), when they have a pound or two of oil seed and grain, millet stalks are the only fodder of the poor man\u2019s cattle, and sometimes they are turned out on the village grazing ground to shift for themselves. Of male buffaloes, the 1876-77 returns show a total of 10,315 head. Most male calves are kept from the mother\u2019s milk and allowed to die. Of cows the total is returned at 49,264 and of she-buffaloes at 180,223. Well-to-do cultivators own from three to ten milch cows and buffaloes. A cow varies in value from \u00a32 to \u00a35 (Rs. 20-50) and a she-buffalo from \u00a33 to \u00a38 (Rs. 30-80). These animals are, except in the rainy season (July-October), almost all stall fed. Their fodder is grass and millet stalks with, when in milk, every day a pound or two of oil seed cake and cotton seed, kap\u0101sia. The townsman generally keeps only one cow or buffalo and uses all its milk in his own family. The cultivator makes most of the milk into clarified butter, sending weekly supplies to market.\u00b2 Professional herdsmen, or Rab\u0101ris, as well as\n\n\u00b9 Generally adad, Phaseolus mungo, or guv\u0101r, Cyamopsis psoralicoides.\n\u00b2 Clarified butter is one of the most valuable of Kaira exports. Some account of the trade is given below.\ncultivators, rear milch cattle both cows and she-buffaloes. Though the Rab\u00e1ris are not a wandering tribe, their cattle are not stall fed. They are supposed to graze them on the common pasture ground. But finding scanty fodder there the Rab\u00e1ris have little scruple in letting their animals stray into any unguarded field. Br\u00e1hmans and V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s generally make over their young calves to Kanbis and Kol\u00eds to be reared. On handing it over the calf is valued, and the common agreement is that when the calf is full grown and again valued the owner pays the man who reared it one-half of the increased price. Milch buffaloes are sent from the district by rail in considerable numbers, chiefly to Surat and Bombay.\n\nSheep and goats, with a total strength of 53,880 head, are reared chiefly by professional herdsmen, Rab\u00e1ris and Bharv\u00e1ds. They are found in greatest numbers in the less highly cultivated districts of M\u00e1tar in the west, and Th\u00e1sra and Kapadvanj in the east. Sheep are bred for their milk, wool, and flesh. Goats for their milk and their flesh. The wool is generally cut twice a year, in November and March. The Rab\u00e1ris cut it themselves with a specially heavy pair of shearing scissors. The wool has little care given to it, and is usually very indifferently washed. Except what little they make into felt and weave into coarse blankets, the Rab\u00e1ris sell their wool to traders, chiefly Musalm\u00e1ns, who export it to Bombay. The trade seems to be of growing importance, as the total sent by rail has risen from twenty-two tons in 1870 to forty-seven in 1877. The sheep\u2019s rutting season is in May. She carries for six months. A sheep is milked from November to June, and generally yields from one to two pounds a day. Of this the young are allowed to suck half and the rest is used to make butter. The milk of twenty sheep would in four days yield about five pounds of butter worth about 3s. 3d. (Rs. 1-10). Sheep begin to bear when three years old and continue till they are about seven. A good ewe is worth 8s. (Rs. 4). A large number of sheep and goats are every year sent by rail to the Bombay market.\n\nHorses are returned at 2366, but by far the greater number of them are mere ponies, unsuited for the purposes of cavalry. In value they vary from \u00a32 to \u00a310 (Rs. 20-100). Most of them are born and reared in the district. Some of the best come from Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and a few show signs of being the produce of the Ahmedabad stud horses. As a rule they are not well taken care of. Many are allowed to feed themselves as they best can, others have millet stalks, and when in work a daily allowance of gram. One of the Government stud horses is stationed at Kaira. In 1876-77 he served thirty-three mares.\n\nFew camels are bred in Kaira, but large numbers are brought during the fair season from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r to graze in the district. A fee of one young camel for each hundred head is paid to Government. The animal is sold and the price credited to revenue. The drivers are for the most part Rajputs and Rab\u00e1ris. A full-grown camel varies in price from \u00a34 to \u00a315 (Rs. 40-150). Asses returned at 6325 are of two kinds, the common ass and the big white ass of H\u00e1l\u00e1r in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The females are kept only by\npotters or kumbh\u00e1rs, and the males by rice huskers or gold\u00e1s. They are used to carry bricks, earth, and rice. In value they vary from 6s. to 14s. (Rs. 3-7) for the common sort, to \u00a31 or \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 10-12) for the big H\u00e1l\u00e1r sort. Fifty years ago many charotar villages were infested with swarms of tame pig. These animals, ownerless and uncared for, lived on such garbage as they could pick up. Filthy and useless they did much harm to the crops. At last so great was the nuisance that the richer classes hired the V\u00e1ghris to cart them out of village limits and set them free. Though still plentiful they have since ceased to be a nuisance.\n\nWild.\n\nOf wild animals, the Tiger, v\u00e1gh, Felis tigris, was within the last ten years (1867) always to be found in the bed or among the ravines of the Mahi. But the spread of tillage and the efforts of European sportsmen in the rough country near the Mahi and in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha and Panch Mah\u00e1l hills have so reduced their number that they are now only occasionally met with. Four tigers were killed in 1876. But in the four preceding years none had been shot.\n\nThe Panther, dipdo, Felis leopardus, is from the same causes as the tiger, becoming scarce. A few are still found on the banks of the Mahi. During the five years ending with 1877 nine panthers were killed, three in 1875, four in 1876, and two in 1877.\n\nThe Wolf, varu, Canis palipes, though becoming rare, is still sometimes seen roving in packs of four or five. They carry off considerable numbers of sheep and goats.\n\nThe Hy\u00e6na, taras, Hy\u00e6na striata; the Jackal, si\u00e1l, Canis aureus; and the Fox, lokri, Vulpes bengalensis, are common, and said to destroy much poultry.\n\nThe Wild Boar, dukar, Sus indicus, abounds along the S\u00e1barmati from Vautha in the west, northwards to Chitr\u00e1sar, then east by the irrigation canal, past L\u00e1li along the banks of the Meshv\u00f3 and V\u00e1trak, in the grass meadows at Kanaj and Mahej, round Kaira, in the Mahudha fields, round Dadusar, and on the broad waste lands and ravines in Kapadvanj and Th\u00e1sra. It does much damage to crops.\n\nOf the deer tribe, the Blue Bull, nilgai, Portax pictus, formerly in numbers over the whole district, has of late years become scarcer and much more wary. They are still found chiefly in the Kapadvanj, Anand, and Mehmadabad sub-divisions, in herds of from eight to ten. The Antelope, hal\u00edar, Antilope bezoartica, is found in large numbers over the whole district. The Indian Gazelle, chikara, Gazella benettii, is also common.\n\n---\n\n1 In the town of Umreth (1830) there were said to be between 6000 and 7000 pig who ate all crops but tobacco.\u2014Sub-Collector 11th June 1831, Bom. Rev. Rec. 406 of 1832, 175: Bom. Gov. Sel., XI., 112.\n\n2 In 1825 tigers were numerous along the Kaira bank of the Mahi. Bishop Heber mentions that in the beginning of that year one was bold enough to carry off a man from a numerous convoy of artillery.\u2014Heb. Nar. II., 137. About the same time (1823) in the extreme north of the district, near Rohisa, six miles from Mehmadabad, was a hill called V\u00e1ghtekro, or the tiger's hill, from the number of tigers that formerly infested and were still found on it.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., X., 130.\nOf smaller animals, the Hare, *sasla*, Lepus ruficaudatus, is found in all parts of the district.\n\nOf wild birds, the Goose, *gauze badak*, Anser cinereus, is found occasionally in some of the large ponds in M\u00e1tar and Kapadvanj. They appear in November and December, coming in flights, generally of from seven to ten, though sometimes of as many as twenty or thirty; they leave about the end of February when the water begins to dry, and generally before the smaller kinds of wild fowl; they have not been known to breed in Kaira; they are very shy, and hard to shoot. The Black-backed Goose, *nukta*, Sarkidiornis melanotus, is found in all parts of the district, remaining throughout the year, and breeding in the months of July and August.\n\nOf Ducks and Teals, many sorts are found, especially in M\u00e1tar, Kapadvanj, and Th\u00e1sra. Except the Whistling, *Dendrocygna arcuata*, and the Cotton Teal, *Nettapus coromandelacus*, which stay all the year round and sometimes breed in the district, most varieties of duck come in October and go in the end of February, or in the less cultivated parts of the district, early in March. Snipe, *p\u00e1nichal*, of three kinds, the common, *Gallinago scolopacinus*, the Jack, *Gallinago gallinula*, and the Painted, *Rhynchoea bengalensis*, are in the cold season found all over the district, but chiefly in the M\u00e1tar, Kapadvanj, and Th\u00e1sra sub-divisions. They come in very poor condition early in October, and except in especially well-watered places, leave by the end of February. Snipe are never known to have bred in the district. Bustard, *malduk*, *Eupodotis edwardsii*, though not common, are found in all parts of the district, but chiefly in Th\u00e1sra and Kapadvanj. They frequent large uncultivated plains, generally in bands of from four to five. They stay in the district during the whole year, breeding from October to March. Florican, *kadmohar*, *Syphotides auritus*, are found in small numbers all over the district. They come in the month of June after the first fall of rain. Taking first to damp low lying land as the rain increases, they gradually seek higher ground; they breed in the district, but leave it in August when the young birds are able to move.\n\nPartridges of two kinds, the Painted, *Fr\u00e1ncolinus pictus*, and the Grey, *Ortygornis pondiceriana*, are found all over the district. They stay during the whole year; the grey breeding from February to May, the painted from June to October. The grey lives near villages, the painted in the more open and lonelier parts.\n\nOf Quail, the two chief kinds are the Grey and the Rain. The Grey, *luvra*, *Coturnix communis*, is found in all parts of the district. They come in October and November, and almost all go in March. A few stay, and from June to August breed in the district. Unlike the Grey Quail, the Rain Quail, *Coturnix coromandelica*, breeds in Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t and remains throughout the year. Towards the end of June, soon after rain has fallen, he is found in the *kodra*, *Paspalum scrobicu-\n\n---\n\n1 Florican would seem not to go far as they are found in numbers during the hot season in the islands of the Narbada.\nlatum, then in the rice, next in October and November, in millet fields, then they are in grass, then about January in pulse, in February in irrigated wheat, and during the hot months in tobacco and castor-oil. Keeping together in large flocks at the beginning of the rains, they pair in July and August, and during the cold weather months are found in small bands, often in company with the grey quail.\n\n**Sand Grouse**, *battir*, Pterocles exustus, are found in considerable numbers in the open plains all over the district. They breed from December to May, and in the morning are generally to be found near water.\n\n**Crane**, *kalum* or *kulim*, Grus cinerea, are found in all parts of the district, especially in the open lands of the M\u00e1tar, Kapadvanj, Mehmadabad, and Th\u00e1sra sub-divisions. They come about the end of October and leave in February or March. In the early morning they feed in fields of rice stubble, and about eight or nine, in flocks of two or three hundred, they rise and fly high in the air. During the heat of the day and at nights they settle in open bushy land or plains generally near the banks of rivers.\n\n**Stone Plover**, *barsiri*, *Edicnemus crepitans*, are found, though in small numbers, in lonely uncultivated tracts all over the district.\n\n**Spoon Bill**, *chamach char*, Platalea leucorodia, are found in pond and marshes two or three together. Though, as a rule, migratory, they are said occasionally to breed in the district.\n\n**Bittern**, *nari*, Botaurus stellaris, are found in ponds, generally solitary; they breed in the district, and are not known to leave it.\n\n**Pea-Fowl**, *mohar*, Pavo cristatus, abound all over the district, and being well treated by the people are found in numbers in and near the villages. They breed from April to October, and are in finest feather during the hot months (April-June).\n\n**Green Pigeon**, *hari\u00e1l*, Crocopus chlorigaster, are found all over the district, especially in the open well-wooded parts. Some are said to stay all the year round.\n\n**Snakes.**\n\nThe two chief poisonous snakes are the Cobra, Naja tripudians and the *Phursa*, Echis carinata. Though Kaira was much infested with snakes, the first attempt in 1856, by the offer of rewards to induce the people to kill them failed. Of late years, though the rewards have been lowered in the case of a cobra from 1s. 6d. to 6d. (12 as.\u20144 as.), and for other snakes from 1s. to 3d. (8 as.\u20142 as.) 199 snakes were killed in 1875, and 259 in 1876. In 1877 the number had again fallen to ten. Human deaths from snake-bites vary much from year to year. In 1856 there were forty-five, between 1866 and 1870 on an average about sixty-two, in 1876 twenty-five, and nineteen in 1877.\n\n**Fish.**\n\nThe rivers of the district, the Mahi, the V\u00e1trak, the Shedhi, the Meshvo, and the Mohar, are well stocked with fish. Of the following thirty-one kinds, twenty-two are found in fresh water, and nine in the river Mahi within tidal limits. The twenty-two fresh water fish are:\u2014\nKAIRA.\n\n(1). The M\u00e1hsir, or Kudn\u00e1ra, Barbus mosal, classed as a soft finned fish, in size, strength, and activity, little inferior to the salmon, is found in the Mahi, V\u00e1trak, Meshvo, and S\u00e1barmati rivers. The m\u00e1hsir may readily be known by a peculiar salmon tint on the belly and a deep guard or shade hanging over the mouth. It spawns during the rains, going up the river when in flood, and generally coming back as soon as the force of the flood is spent. It eats anything, grain, shrimps, crabs, fish, and frogs. Especially of an evening as it works down stream its curious habit of taking, one after another, five or six heavy rolling porpoise-like leaps has given it its name of kudn\u00e1ra, or the jumper. Especially by the natives it is much prized for food. It is generally caught in the coarse trawling net, or m\u00e1haj\u00e1l, and sent in considerable numbers to Baroda. Fished with the rod and fly, or if larger fish are fished with the rod and artificial minnow or spoon, the m\u00e1hsir gives very good sport. From dawn to sunrise, or even as late as nine, and in the afternoon from four to dark are the best times for fishing. Though the heavier fish are found in deep pools, from many a knee-deep rapid two or three good m\u00e1hsir may be drawn. In 1877 towards the close of the season (March), with a rod and fly, in one day seventy pounds of fish were landed, the largest two feet six inches long and weighing thirty pounds. Still the stock of m\u00e1hsir is much less than it might be. Kolis dam the head of a small stream, leaving only four or five openings, and opposite each opening draw a cloth or place closely plaited deep bamboo-baskets, catching swarms of almost uselessly small fry. Large fish also are caught in numbers, poisoned by branches of the milk bush.\n\n(2). The carp, Debra, and Darai, Barilius Bakeri, a silver-scaled fish, about a foot long and a pound in weight, is found in all the rivers and many of the ponds of the district. Like the m\u00e1hsir, the carp breeds during the rainy mouths, going up the river to spawn in times of heavy flood and soon returning to the deeper pools down the stream. It is much prized as food, especially by natives. By the natives it is generally killed by netting. Among some of the wilder tribes, towards the close of the hot weather, it is a favourite amusement for a party of men, women, and children to dash into one of the big pools, and with small triangular nets in their hands, wading up to the shoulders, to clear the whole place of carp. With the rod, either with flour or worm bait, or with the fly, they can be caught in considerable numbers. But the sport is much tamer than m\u00e1hsir fishing. Like the m\u00e1hsir fry, vast stores of young carp are destroyed by basket and cloth traps.\n\n(3). The Marel, also called Dorch, a handsome fish of the pike species, is sometimes found three feet long and from twenty to thirty pounds in weight. The marel lives both in ponds and in rivers, generally in the bank. They breed twice a year; in December and January, and again in June. They are known to hollow a place for the spawn, and until the fry are from two to three inches long to watch by them in turns, protecting them with the greatest fierceness. Though greedy, they\n\n---\n\n1 They are also said before spawning to nibble blades of grass from the water's edge and make them into a tray or nest for the eggs.\nare very shy. They are killed in two ways, either by the rod and frog bait, or shot when they come to the surface. Though only stunned by the bullet, the marel can generally be secured before he recovers.\n\nThe marel is a favourite fish, especially with Europeans. (4). The P\u00e1dia, a large scaleless fish, sometimes from two to three feet long, and weighing as much as twenty pounds, is said to breed in the hot weather, the female depositing the eggs at any time during the rains when the river is heavily flooded. It is caught chiefly in the strong trawling net. It is eaten by Europeans and natives. (5). The Nagra, a large fish, sometimes two feet long and ten pounds in weight, like the p\u00e1dia, lays its eggs when the rivers are deep in flood. It is caught chiefly by the strong trawling net, and is a favourite article of food with the natives. (6). The Rau, up to three feet long and fifteen pounds in weight, lives both in rivers and ponds. It breeds during the rains. Generally caught in the coarse trawling net, it is much liked, especially by natives, and is sent in considerable quantities to Baroda. (7). The Baus, or Bavus, with large silvery scales, found up to three feet in length and weighing from thirty to forty pounds, lives in deep ponds and river pools. It breeds during the rains, the female depositing eggs and leaving the fry to take care of themselves. Caught in the strong trawling net, it is eaten chiefly by natives and is sent to Baroda. (8). The Boi, or mullet, found up to two feet in length and weighing from eight to nine pounds, lives chiefly in rivers. It breeds during the hot season, the females laying eggs before the rains set in. In the first floods it makes for the sea and does not come back till November, when the water is clear. Generally caught in the coarse trawling net, it is sometimes shot. It is much prized by Europeans. (9). The Singkro, or Katio, a scaleless barbed fish, found from two to three feet in length and weighing about fifteen pounds, lives in rivers and ponds. It breeds in June; the female hollowing a place in the river bank, and in turns with the male watching the young fish with the greatest care. Sometimes caught with a line and bait, it is generally taken in the coarse trawling net. It is a favourite food with the natives. (10). The Sarm\u00e1i, a rather uncommon scaleless fish, said to have barbs at the gills that wound as keenly as a scorpion's bite, is seldom found more than a foot long or a pound in weight. It lives chiefly in rivers, spawning during the floods of the rainy season. Caught both on baited lines and in nets, it is much prized as an article of food, especially by Europeans. (11). The Belja, or Karothi, a common bright-scaled fish, seldom found more than a foot long or over three pounds in weight, lives both in rivers and ponds. It breeds during the rainy season, spawning when the rivers are in flood. It is caught on the long line and in nets, and is eaten only by the natives. (12). The B\u00e1no, or eel, up to three feet in length and a pound in weight, is found in ponds and rivers. It breeds in the rainy season when the rivers are in flood. It is caught by the long line and in nets, and is chiefly eaten by Europeans. (13). The prawn, known as the Zingo, Sondia, Roi, Alu, or Kolimbu, common both in rivers and ponds, and caught in nets, is a favourite article of food, both with Europeans and natives. (14). The Gh\u00e1lu, or Moru, with dark,\nlustrous scales, found a foot long, and half a pound in weight, lives both in ponds and rivers. It breeds during the rainy season, and is caught both by the hook and the net; it is eaten by Europeans. (15). The Bhagna or Kasoda, a bright-scaled fish, found about one foot long and two pounds in weight, lives both in ponds and rivers. It breeds in the rainy season. It is caught in nets, and eaten chiefly by natives. (16). The Marbi, about six inches long and half a pound in weight, is chiefly a river fish. It spawns during the rainy season. It is caught in nets, and eaten chiefly by natives. (17). The R\u00e1ya, a bright-scaled fish, about six inches long and half a pound in weight, lives chiefly in rivers, where it breeds in the rainy season. It is netted and eaten chiefly by natives. (18). The Gohari, a small, bright-scaled fish, about a foot long and three quarters of a pound in weight, is found chiefly in the rivers, where it breeds during the rainy season. It is netted, and eaten chiefly by natives. (19). The Chal, a small, delicate-scaled fish, seldom over half a foot in length or a quarter of a pound in weight, is chiefly a river fish, where it breeds in times of flood. Though generally netted, it gives good sport with a rod and line, and as an article of food is much liked by Europeans. (20). The Zarva, like the chal, but smaller, not more than four inches long and something under an ounce in weight, is almost entirely a river fish. It breeds in the rains, rushing up the rivers when in highest flood. It is caught in the small meshed net and eaten by the natives. (21). The Moela, or Bh\u00e1t, is another small fish, in appearance and habits very like the Zarva. (22). The Chingi, Shingi, or Kadwa, is a dark-coloured scaleless fish, not unlike the eel. It is said to have poisonous barbs at the gills, which wound as severely as a scorpion's bite, and cause three days fever. It is about a foot long and two pounds in weight, and though living chiefly in ponds, is found in rivers and sometimes in wells. It is caught in the small meshed net, and is a favourite food with Europeans.\n\nSalt water fish are found only in the Mahi below the tidal limit. They belong to two classes, those found in the cold and hot weather, and those found in the rains. Of the cold weather fish there are six chief sorts, the Fausta, the Zinja, the Zinja Chola, the Bamvo, the Biv, and the Kantia. Of rain fish there are three, the P\u00e1lva, Dodi, and Magra. Of these the dodi is the largest, growing to ten pounds in weight. The dodi and the p\u00e1lva are much esteemed, and are salted as well as eaten fresh. The rainy season fish come into the river about June, and after staying for about a month pass out again into the gulf. They would seem not to spawn in the river, no fry have been found in the Mahi, and on their way back the old fish are often taken heavy with eggs. These fish are all caught in the golva, the long pocket-shaped tidal stake net.\u00b9\n\nBesides Musalm\u00e1ns, Kolis, and other fish-eating peasants, among the Kaira population are three professional fishing tribes\u2014Bhois,\n\n\u00b9The Mahi tidal stake net does not differ from that in use in the Narbada.\u2014Bombay Gazetteer, II., 366.\nM\u00e1chhis, and Kh\u00e1rvas, the last of whom trade in fish.\\footnote{According to the Census returns, these four classes represent a total population of 13,639 souls. Fishing is not their only means of living. Further details of these classes are given below.} Fishing chiefly with hand and drag-nets and with baited lines, they also kill large numbers, drawing them to the surface by the light of a torch, and then cutting them to pieces with swords and in the smaller streams by soaking in the water the milk-bush and other poisonous shrubs.\\footnote{The nets in use do not differ from the Broach nets.\u2014Bombay Gazetteer, II., 363\u2014365.}\n\nIn a district where almost all the well-to-do and influential classes object to the destruction of life there is no public fish market. The fish is carried for sale from house to house, especially to the dwellings of Rajputs, Musalm\u00e1ns, and Kolis. The supply is generally greater than the demand, and the price not more than \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. (six pies) a pound in money or grain. The larger class of fish are to a small extent sent by rail to Baroda. There is little fish-salting in the district. The stock of fish in the Kaira rivers is said of late years to have considerably fallen off. In the Mahi, the common belief is that this decline is due to the river\u2019s wrath at losing cart-men\u2019s offerings. For some years the floods have been irregular and the fish unable to work up to their proper spawning grounds. There would seem also to be a very reckless destruction of life. For, though the netting of well-grown fish does little harm, the planting of fixed basket and cloth traps is said to destroy immense quantities of fry.\\footnote{The accounts of wild animals, game birds, and fish, have been contributed by Major W. P. LaTouche, District Superintendent of Police.}\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nAccording to the 1846 census, the total population of the district was 566,513 souls, or 354\u00b707 to the square mile: Hindus numbered 514,558, or 90\u00b783 per cent, and Musalm\u00e1ns 51,938, or 9\u00b716 per cent; that is, at the rate of ten Hindus to one Musalm\u00e1n. There were besides, ten Christians and seven P\u00e1rsis. The 1872 census showed a startling increase in population, the total returns amounting to no less than 782,733 souls, or 489\u00b720 to the square mile, a pressure of population higher than in any other part of the Bombay Presidency. Of the total number, 711,619 were Hindus, 70,741 Musalm\u00e1ns, 305 Christians, and 68 P\u00e1rsis. Compared with Musalm\u00e1ns, while P\u00e1rsis had considerably and Christians had very greatly increased, the proportion of Hindus had remained nearly constant at ten to one. The percentage of males on the total population was 53\u00b755 and of females 46\u00b745.\n\nThe following statement shows that in the twenty-six years (1846-1872) population advanced 38\u00b716 per cent; houses increased from 150,628 to 218,596, or 45\u00b712 per cent; ploughs from 54,975 to 56,916, or 3\u00b753 per cent; and carts from 20,864 to 29,110, or 39\u00b752 per cent. Under the head of agricultural live stock, the statement shows, in the number of oxen, an increase from 136,076 to 137,962, or a rise of 1\u00b738 per cent; in that of buffaloes from 146,940 to 280,443, or of 36\u00b741 per cent; in that of sheep and goats from 52,321 to 58,945 or of 12\u00b766 per cent; in that of asses from 5935 to 6482, or of 9\u00b721 per cent; and in that of camels from 76 to 175, or of 130\u00b720 per cent. On the other hand, there is a fall in the number of cows from 69,179 to 52,158, or of 24\u00b760 per cent; and in that of horses from 2913 to 2274, or of 21\u00b793 per cent.\n\nKaira Population, 1846 and 1872.\n\n| YEAR | POPULATION | HOUSES |\n|------|------------|--------|\n|      | Hindus     | Musalm\u00e1ns | P\u00e1rsis | Christians | Others | Total |\n| 1846 | 514,558    | 51,938   | 7      | 10        | ...    | 566,513 |\n| 1872 | 711,619    | 70,741   | 68     | 305       | ...    | 782,733 |\n| Increase per cent | 38\u00b729 | 38\u00b720 | ... | ... | ... | 38\u00b716 |\n\n1 The pressure of population per square mile varies considerably in the different sub-divisions.

The Musalm\u00e1n population belongs to two sects, Sunni and Shia; the former numbered 68,527 souls, or 96\u00b787 per cent of the total Musalm\u00e1n population; and the latter, including the Surat or Daud\u00ed trading Bohoras, the Momn\u00e1s, and few Khoja families, numbered 2214 souls, or 3\u00b713 per cent. The Parsis are divided into two classes, Shansh\u00e1i and Kadmi; the number of the former was fifty-five or 80\u00b788 per cent, and of the latter was thirteen or 19\u00b712 per cent. In the total of 305 Christians, are included seventeen Catholics and 292 Protestants, including 39 Episcopalians, 10 Presbyterians, and 243 native Christians.\n\nAccording to occupation, the census returns for 1872 divide the whole population into seven classes:\n\nI.\u2014Employed under Government or municipal and other local authorities, numbering in all 5289 souls or 0\u00b767 per cent of the entire population.\n\nII.\u2014Professional persons 7012 or 0\u00b789 per cent.\n\nIII.\u2014In service or performing personal offices 7364 or 0\u00b794 per cent.\n\nIV.\u2014Engaged in agriculture and with animals 176,764 or 22\u00b758 per cent.\n\nV.\u2014Engaged in commerce and trade 7091 or 0\u00b790 per cent.\n\nVI.\u2014Employed in mechanical arts, manufactures, and engineering operations, and engaged in the sale of articles manufactured or otherwise prepared for consumption 53,455 or 6\u00b752 per cent.\n\nVII.\u2014Miscellaneous persons not classed otherwise\u2014(a) wives 229,857 and children 236,190, in all 516,047 or 65\u00b793 per cent; and (b) miscellaneous persons 9711 or 1\u00b724 per cent\u2014total 525,758 or 67\u00b717 per cent.\n\nThe general chapter on the population of Gujar\u00e1t includes such information as is available regarding the origin and customs of the Kaira people. The following details show the strength of the different castes and races as far as it was ascertained by the census of 1872.\n\nUnder Br\u00e1hmans came, exclusive of sub-divisions, forty-nine divisions, with a strength of 43,301 souls (males 21,887, females 21,414), or 6\u00b708 per cent of the total Hindu population. The service of Government is the employment most coveted by Br\u00e1hmans of all classes. But except the N\u00e1gars and Kh\u00e9d\u00e1v\u00e1ls, who act as merchants, money-lenders, and pleaders, the majority of Br\u00e1hmans live on alms. Among Br\u00e1hmans, the N\u00e1gars numbering 1808 or 4\u00b717 per cent of the total Br\u00e1hman population hold the first place. Next to the N\u00e1gars, the Kh\u00e9d\u00e1v\u00e1l or town of Kaira (Kheda) Br\u00e1hmans, in number 9920 or 22\u00b790 per cent of the whole Br\u00e1hman population, are the most prosperous and influential class. Families of this caste are under the same name settled in Benares, Haidarabad, Sering\u00e1patam, and other parts of India. They are said, about a thousand years ago, to have been brought from the Deccan and settled in Gujar\u00e1t. Industrious,\n\n---\n\n1 Minute details of each of these main classes will be found in the 1872 Census Report, II., 236-265. The remarks in foot-note 1, at page 51 of the Surat Statistical Account, apply to the details of this classification by occupation.\nfrugal, and intelligent, most of them hold good positions as landowners, money-lenders, traders, and Government servants. Among the remaining sub-divisions, the most noticeable are the Vad\u00e1dra Br\u00e1hmans. These men, for the most part residents of Mehmadabad, travel all over Gujar\u00e1t. By the pretended practice of magic and by begging they occasionally amass considerable fortunes and settle in Kaira as money-lenders. A few Deccan Br\u00e1hmans, descendants of some who during the eighteenth century came from Poona with the Mar\u00e1tha armies, continue to hold respectable positions in the service of Government.\n\nWriters.\n\nUnder the head of writers came three classes, Brahma Kshatris 88, Parbhus 62, and K\u00e1yasths 8, with a total strength of 158 souls (males 93, females 65), or 0\u00b72 per cent of the total Hindu population. The Brahma Kshatris are the descendants of one family, who, as hereditary district officers, hold an estate in the village of Alina in the Nadi\u00e1d sub-division. The younger branches of the family have from time to time left Alina in search of a livelihood. But though settled in different parts of the district they still keep up their connection with those of their family who have remained at home. The Parbhus belong to two classes, P\u00e1th\u00e1re and K\u00e1yasth. The K\u00e1yasth Parbhus settled in Gujar\u00e1t after its conquest by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s (1723-1757). The P\u00e1th\u00e1re Parbhus settled in Kaira in the beginning of the present century. They do not consider Kaira as their home, and keep family and marriage relations with members of their own caste settled in Bombay.\n\nTraders.\n\nUnder the head of mercantile trading and shop-keeping classes came 22,532 V\u00e1ni\u00e1s belonging to seventeen divisions; 5852 Guj\u00e1r\u00e1ti Shr\u00e1vaks of five divisions; five M\u00e1rv\u00e1di Shr\u00e1vaks and 2928 Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s and Luv\u00e1n\u00e1s giving a total strength of 31,317 souls (males 16,440, females 14,877) or 4\u00b740 per cent of the entire Hindu population. Of these classes the most influential are the V\u00e1ni\u00e1s and Shr\u00e1vaks. The wealthiest of them act as money-lenders, making advances to petty village usurers, traders, merchants, and the better class of husbandmen. Those who have little capital, borrowing money on easy terms from the wealthier members of their caste employ it in usury or in dealing in cloth, grain, molasses, and oil, while some moving from village to village hawk spices and condiments. Failing to recover their claims in cash the better class of money-lenders not unfrequently secure the land of their debtor which they then allow him to cultivate at rack-rent. But they take little interest in these purchases. They never till their own land or even superintend its cultivation, and seldom invest capital in agricultural improvements. Besides engaging in trade they strive eagerly for employment in Government service. In former times they supplied the greater number of the chief district revenue officers. In 1873 the offices of district revenue superintendent or des\u00e1i and of district accountant or majmud\u00e1r, which for many years had existed only in name, were abolished. But in other branches of Government service many V\u00e1ni\u00e1s are still employed, some of them in highly-paid and responsible posts. A large number of V\u00e1ni\u00e1s 10,293 or 45\u00b768 per cent\nof their total strength belong to the Khad\u00e1yata sub-division. This class, an offshoot of the N\u00e1g\u00e1r V\u00e1nia division, is said to take its name from Khad\u00e1l a village near Par\u00e1ntij in the Ahmedabad district. The Shr\u00e1vaks mentioned above are almost all natives of Gujar\u00e1t. The M\u00e1rv\u00e1d Shr\u00e1vaks, so powerful south of the T\u00e1pti, hold no place of importance in Kaira. Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s and Luv\u00e1n\u00e1s, strangers from Cutch and Sind, are spreading over the rural parts of the district, and as village grocers or neeti, by their superior strength and energy, are depriving the local V\u00e1nia and Shr\u00e1vak traders of their former monopoly.\n\nUnder the head of cultivators came five classes, with a total strength of 456,634 souls (males 248,384, females 208,250), or 58.33 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 144,639 (males 82,430, females 62,209) were Kanbis; 23,508 (males 12,472, females 11,036) Rajputs; 6259 (males 3311, females 2948) Kachhi\u00e1s; 976 (males 493, females 483) M\u00e1lis; and 281,252 (males 149,678, females 131,574) Kolis. Of the different classes of cultivators, the most important are the Leva and Kadva Kanbis. The best farmers in the district, sober, quiet, industrious, and except on such special occasions as marriages, thrifty, they number altogether 144,639 souls or 20.32 per cent of the whole Hindu population. The Leva Kanbis with a total strength of 131,781 souls are most numerous in the sub-divisions of A'nand, Nadi\u00e1d, and Borsad; the Kadva Kanbis number altogether 12,768 souls in Kapadvanj and Mehmadabad. Among the members of each of these castes, there exists a subordinate division into p\u00e1tid\u00e1rs, originally village shareholders, men of considerable estates, and kanbis or simple cultivators. This distinction, though based on difference in wealth and social position and not in variety of blood or race, is sufficiently marked to form an obstacle to intermarriage. Again among the p\u00e1tid\u00e1rs or better class of Leva Kanbis, the landowners of some villages hold among their caste fellows a position of special honour. This section of the caste, probably the descendants of the leading men among the original settlers in Gujar\u00e1t, are known as men of family or kulia. The rest as men of no family or akulia. Formerly there was a keen competition among the lower families to marry their daughters into the higher houses, and great sums were paid to secure this honour. But of late years this custom has to a great extent disappeared. The bulk of the lower families agreed to marry only among persons in their own social position, and among themselves to give or take in marriage without claiming any dowry. Under these circumstances those of high family were forced to marry among their own houses. In 1872 out of 4290 marriages, 3977 were arranged by an interchange of children. Cultivating Rajputs belong to two classes, th\u00e1kors, heads of families, who still retain considerable landed estates, and gar\u00e1s\u00edas, descendants of the younger branches of Th\u00e1kor houses, who in many instances have sunk to the position of ordinary peasant proprietors. The landed gentry, though they have long given up any turbulent practices, still in their dress and bearing shew themselves the representatives of a military class. Careless and improvident their estates have for many years been deeply mortgaged and heavily\nburdened with debt. So unsatisfactory was their condition that special measures for freeing them from their indebtedness were considered necessary. An Act (14 of 1877) has accordingly been passed, providing for the advance by Government of funds sufficient to meet all legitimate claims upon their estates. It is also provided that until the loan shall have been repaid the property should be managed by a Government officer. The cultivating Rajputs are less careful and hardworking than the Kanbis and inferior to them in skill. Kachhias and Malis grow vegetables, fruit, and flowers. A few Kachhias have become artisans.\n\nThe Koli element in the population of the district is important. They form the largest tribe or caste with a total strength of 281,252 or 35.93 per cent of the entire population. They are the most prolific section of the people, increasing during twenty-six years (1846-1872) from 175,829 to 281,252, an advance of 59.96 per cent. They are also the class whose character and position have improved most under British rule. Idle and turbulent in the early part of the present century, they are now as a body quiet and hard-working. Even in the most settled times of Gujar\u00e1t history, the Kolis were only partially brought under order, and during the disturbances and misrule of the eighteenth century they threw off every restraint, and for the most part lived on the proceeds of plunder and robbery. In 1812, though they had then already begun to forsake their former habits, they are described as a lawless race, conspicuous as the perpetrators of gang robberies and other atrocities. In 1825 they were still one of the most turbulent predatory tribes in India. Regular troops, even the European cavalry, had continually to be called out against them. In no other part of India were the roads so insecure; in none were gang robberies and organised plundering excursions more frequent, or a greater proportion of the gentry and landed proprietors addicted to acts of violence and bloodshed. In 1826 the Kolis were still further unsettled, by disturbances caused by a fanatic of the name of Govindas; and for several years after, the country would seem, to an unusual extent, to have suffered from their turbulence. In 1832 bands of Kolis, from fifty to two hundred strong infested the high roads. In 1833 they twice attacked the town of Mehmadabad, and on each occasion several lives were lost. Two years later (1835) the Collector almost in despair writes 'some special regulations should be made about the Kolis. No measures of ordinary severity seem to have any effect. We never hear of a reformed Koli, or of one whose mode of life places him beyond suspicion. All seem alike, rich and poor, those whose necessities\n\n---\n\n1 This very great increase in numbers is perhaps partly due to the unsettled state of the Kolis at the time of the 1846 census, which must have made any complete record of their numbers almost impossible.\n2 Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, I., 692.\n3 Heber's Narrative, II., 142.\n4 Government 500, March 2nd, 1831; Collector 9, January 24th, 1831, and subsequent correspondence.\nafford them an excuse for crime, and those whose condition places them out of the reach of distress, are alike ready on the first opportunity of plunder.' The time of distress passed over, and after ten years of quiet (1844) the Kolis are spoken of as 'more peaceable and greatly subdued.' Most of them had settled down to the work of cultivating. Still, as a rule, they were ignorant and averse from work, and grew only the poorer and lighter crops. The ten next years brought some further improvement. They (1855) are said to commit thefts and robberies only 'sometimes when impelled by want.' They were still very poor, subsisting on the fruit of mahuda trees or some wild growing vegetables. But they had now some credit. They could raise loans, though the unscrupulousness of the lender and their own ignorance and carelessness made this change seem but a doubtful gain. A few years later (1857) at the time of the mutinies in Upper India, the unquiet conduct of the Kolis caused Government much uneasiness. But their attempted risings were promptly suppressed, and no general disturbance took place. After the mutiny troubles were over, the period of higher prices (1858-1864) and well paid field labour raised the Kolis to a position of comfort. Still careless and improvident in their time of prosperity (1864-1870) they failed to free themselves from their liabilities. The fall in prices during the next five years left many of them poor and deep sunk in debt. Steady improvement however continues; the great demand for produce during the last two (1876-1877) years has again lightened the money-lender's pressure. More land is brought under the plough, their mode of tillage is less careless and rude, and fewer among them lead idle or vicious lives.\n\nOf manufacturers there were three classes with a total strength of 4030 souls (males 2031, females 1999), or 0\u00b756 per cent of the total Hindu population. Of these 3883 (males 1957, females 1926) were Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs, calico-printers; 122 (males 63, females 59) Khatris, weavers; and 25 (males 11, females 14) Gh\u00e1nchis, oil-pressers. Owing to the competition of European goods, the condition of the Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs or calico-printers is somewhat depressed. The number of Khatris or hand-loom weavers is very small. This is due not so much to the decrease of the demand for hand-woven cloth as to the fact that the great body of hand-loom weavers are Musalm\u00e1ns. For the same reason the number of oil-pressers is small, the business being almost entirely in the hands of Musalm\u00e1ns of the Gh\u00e1nchi class.\n\nOf artisans whose condition on the whole is said to be good, there were eight classes with a total strength of 30,447 souls (males 15,832, females 14,615), or 4\u00b727 per cent of the total Hindu population. Of these 2740 (males 1432, females 1308) were Sonis, gold and silver-smiths; 9566 (males 5021, females 4535) Suth\u00e1rs, carpenters; 515 (males 263, females 252) Kans\u00e1rs, copper-smiths; 317 (males 172, females 145) Kadiy\u00e1s or Chun\u00e1r\u00e1s, bricklayers; 17 (males 8, females 9) Sal\u00e1ts, masons; 5809 (males 3002, females 2807) Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 2458 (males 1281, females 1177) Darjis, tailors; and 9065 (males 4653, females 4382) Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters.\n\nOf bards and actors there were four classes with a total strength of 8768 souls (males 4794, females 3974), or 1\u00b723 per cent of\nthe whole Hindu population. Of these 7070 (males 3919, females 3151) were Bh\u00e1ts or B\u00e1rots, bards; 810 (males 444, females 366) Ch\u00e1rans or Gh\u00e1dvis, genealogists; 103 Bhav\u00e1y\u00e1s, strolling comedians, all men; 19 (males 14, females 5) Ghandhraps or songsters; and 785 (males 328, females 457) Vy\u00e1sd\u00e1s. The Bh\u00e1ts or B\u00e1rots, the Rajput bards and genealogists, have lost much of the importance that formerly attached to them from the sanctity of their persons. Many of them, whose chances of earning a livelihood as sureties or guides have ceased, now engage in ordinary occupations, tilling the land and lending money. Some are still employed as bards or genealogists. From their head-quarters in the Kaira district the bards travel to the most distant parts of India. Their different stations are visited in order, generally after an interval of two or three years. At each station they resort to castes who claim a Rajput descent. Entertained at his patron's expense the bard generally remains in one place for several months. During this time he notes down for each family the births, marriages or deaths, that have happened since his last visit. These particulars are carried away, and on his return to Gujar\u00e1t are entered in his records. The Bhav\u00e1y\u00e1s, leaving their women in northern Gujar\u00e1t, travel during the cold and hot seasons over the province, acting plays and returning to their homes for the rains. The Gandhraps, who teach dancing girls and accompany their dancing performances with music, go to great distances and are sometimes absent from their homes for a year or two at a time. Except a few families in Ahmedabad the Vy\u00e1sd\u00e1s are peculiar to Kaira. They claim to be of Br\u00e1hman descent of the same stock as the Bhav\u00e1y\u00e1s. But for long they have given up acting and are now as a rule well off, supporting themselves as cultivators and money-lenders.\n\nOf personal servants there were three classes with a total strength of 11,742 souls (males 6161, females 5581), or 1\u00b765 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 10,647 (males 5600, females 5047) were Haj\u00e1ms, barbers; 1079 (males 553, females 526) Dhobhis, washermen; and 16 (males 8, females 8) Bhistis, water-drawers.\n\nOf herdsmen and shepherds there were two classes with a total strength of 7968 souls (males 4203, females 3765), or 1\u00b711 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 1500 (males 798, females 702) were Bharv\u00e1ds, and 6468 (males 3405, females 3063) Rab\u00e1ris. The Bharv\u00e1ds are an inferior class of shepherds. They wander from place to place, living in the meanest huts and with no stock more valuable than sheep and goats. The Rab\u00e1ris are better off. They live in towns and villages in well built houses. They own cows and buffaloes as well as sheep and goats and are a hardy and active set of men.\n\nOf fishers and sailors there were three classes with a total strength of 13,639 (males 7287, females 6352), or 1\u00b791 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 12,291 (males 6544, females 5747) were Bhois; 51 (males 46, females 5) Kh\u00e1rv\u00e1s, sailors; and 1297 (males 697, females 600) M\u00e1chhis. Besides their employment as fresh-water fishers, the Kaira Bhois are cultivators, palanquin bearers, and domestic servants.\nOf labourers and miscellaneous workers there were fourteen classes, with a total strength of 19,302 souls (males 10,268, females 9034), or 2\u00b771 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 1129 (males 530, females 599) were Gol\u00e1s, rice-pounders; 53 (males 38, females 15) Bh\u00e1dbhunj\u00e1s, grain parchers; 376 (males 198, females 178) Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s of several castes from the Deccan, employed chiefly in domestic service; 27 (males 19, females 8) Purab\u00ed\u00e1s of several castes from Northern India, employed chiefly in domestic service; 235 (males 138, females 97) M\u00e1rv\u00e1d\u00eds, labourers; 140 (males 67, females 73) Kal\u00e1ls, liquor-sellers; 1081 (males 546, females 535) \u00d3ds, well diggers; 10,906 (males 5863, females 5043) V\u00e1ghris, fowlers, hunters and beggars; 4076 (males 2198, females 1878) R\u00e1val\u00ed\u00e1s, cotton-tape-makers and beggars; 71 (males 34, females 37) B\u00e1vch\u00e1s and Poml\u00e1\u00eds, apparently of Deccan origin, labourers; 24 (males 11, females 13) V\u00e1d\u00ed\u00eds, jugglers; 25 (males 14, females 11) Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s, grain carriers; 1159 (males 612, females 547) Baj\u00e1n\u00e1\u00eds, acrobats. Except the Gol\u00e1s, Bh\u00e1dbhunj\u00e1s, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Purab\u00ed\u00e1s, and Kal\u00e1ls, whose earnings suffice for the ordinary expenses, these classes are poor, ill clad, and without credit.\n\nOf workers in leather there were two classes, with a total strength of 13,706 souls (males 7197, females 6509), or 1\u00b792 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 2980 (males 1532, females 1448) were Moch\u00eds, shoemakers in good condition; and 10,726 (males 5665, females 5061) Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s, tanners, one of the depressed or unclean classes, in poor condition.\n\nBesides the Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s there were five depressed castes with a total strength of 61,834 souls (males 32,375, females 29,459), or 8\u00b768 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 1846 (males 946, females 900) were Garud\u00e1s or Dhed priests; 42,732 (males 22,384, females 20,348) Dheds, weavers and carriers of dead animals; 1905 (males 1003, females 902) Sindhv\u00e1s, a sub-division of Dheds; 365 (males 191, females 174) Tur\u00eds, another sub-division of Dheds; 14,986 (males 7851, females 7135) Bhangi\u00e1s, or sweepers. The Dheds, distinguished alike for industry and for general good behaviour, were formerly supported in tolerable comfort by weaving coarse cotton cloth. But the establishment of steam weaving mills in Bombay and their spread through the chief towns of Gujar\u00e1t has flooded the markets with supplies of a cloth, cheaper, but in other respects similar to the produce of the Dhed hand-looms. Failing to compete with this steam-woven cloth, and from their degraded position unable to procure employment in the steam factories, many of the Dheds are falling into great poverty. The Bhangi\u00e1s are also in a miserable condition.\n\nDevotees and religious mendicants of various names, Brahmac\u00e1h\u00e1s, Vair\u00e1g\u00eds, Gos\u00e1\u00eds, S\u00e1dh\u00fas, and Jog\u00eds, numbered 8754 (males 5174, females 3580), or 1\u00b723 per cent of the whole Hindu population. The fame of D\u00e1kor and Vadtl attracts many religious beggars. At D\u00e1kor several resident devotees, S\u00e1dh\u00fas, Vair\u00e1g\u00eds, and Gos\u00e1\u00eds, some of them possessed of much wealth, support monasteries or maths, where large numbers of religious beggars are daily fed.\n\nAmong the five British districts of Gujar\u00e1t, as regards the propor-\nChapter III.\n\nPopulation.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns.\n\ntion of Musalm\u00e1n inhabitants, Kaira stands third with 70,741 souls or about nine per cent of the district population. Of their whole number 17,701 were in 1872 returned as settled in the sub-division of Nadi\u00e1d, 11,808 in A'nand, 9385 in Th\u00e1sra, 8485 in Kapadvanj, and 7291 in Mehmadabad. Exclusive of 22,017 females and 26,314 children, in all 48,331 or 68\u00b732 per cent of the whole, the male adult Musalm\u00e1n population (22,410) were in 1872 employed as follows: in Government or other public service 1260; in professions 301; in personal service 459; in agriculture 13,552; in trade 526; in mechanical arts and manufactures 5557; and in miscellaneous callings 755.\n\nIn addition to the four regular divisions, Syeds, Sheikhs, Path\u00e1ns, and Moghals, numbering altogether 24,170 souls or about one-third of the whole, there are several classes almost all of them descendants of converted Hindus, cultivators, traders, oil-pressers, weavers, and bricklayers. Of these the chief are the Sip\u00e1his 15,649, village servants and cultivators; the Bohor\u00e1s 13,935, traders and oil-pressers; the Molesal\u00e1ms 7066, land-owners and cultivators; the Maleks 6761, land-owners and cultivators; the T\u00e1is and Momm\u00e1s 663, weavers of cotton cloth; and the Chun\u00e1r\u00e1s 400, bricklayers. There is besides a considerable miscellaneous population, chiefly of barbers, butchers, and beggars.\n\nSip\u00e1his.\n\nThe Sip\u00e1his are probably the descendants of the mercenary troops who, in the reign of Ahmad I. (1412-1443), received allotments of land. They still, to a large extent, act as village messengers, and watchmen, r\u00e1vani\u00e1s. As cultivators, men of this as well as of other classes of Kaira Muhammadians hold a very low position. In 1875 they are described as in more depressed circumstances than the Kolis or any other caste or tribe. Lazy, ignorant, and careless, they labour under the special disadvantage, that their women do not help them in field work.\n\nBohor\u00e1s.\n\nOf the two classes of Bohor\u00e1s, the more important both in number and in wealth, are the Shia Bohor\u00e1s, the followers of the Mulla S\u00e1heb of Surat. In 1877, of 7733 the total strength of this class, 4758 belonged to the D\u00e1ud, and 2975 to the Sulem\u00e1n sub-division. These Shia Bohor\u00e1s are townsmen and traders. In Kapadvanj, their head-quarters, their large, well built, and neatly kept dwellings ornament the town. And their capital and vigour maintain an important trade in glass, soap, and carnelian stones. Unlike those of their class in Broach, the Sunni Bohor\u00e1s of Kaira are not cultivators. Some of them are cartmen and carriers. But most are oil-pressers, and so as a class they are known as Gh\u00e1nchi Bohor\u00e1s. Speaking Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed in their homes, marrying only among their own class, in food, dress, and mode of living unlike ordinary Musalm\u00e1ns, there seems little reason to doubt that most, if not all, of these men are Hindus of the Gh\u00e1nchi, or oil-presser caste, converted to Isl\u00e1m under one of the Musalm\u00e1n sovereigns of Ahmedabad. An active and thrifty class, they have as carriers lost much from the competition of the railway. But in pressing oil they still find steady and well paid work.\n\nMolesal\u00e1ms.\n\nThe Molesal\u00e1ms or slaves of Isl\u00e1m, Rajputs half converted during\nthe reign of Mahmud Begada (1459-1511) are for the most part cultivators in poor circumstances. The rest, representatives of old R\u00e1jput houses, still, as th\u00e1kors and t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, form a somewhat important class of landed gentry.\n\nAnother class of Hindu converts to Isl\u00e1m, the Maleks are settled chiefly in the Th\u00e1sra sub-division. They hold twenty-five villages, the development of twelve villages originally granted to them in reward for signal services at the siege of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad or Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner (1484-1486). Among these Maleks, some are superior and some are inferior holders. But all are thriftless, wanting in energy, and very generally addicted to the use of opium.\u00b9\n\nThough the T\u00e1is and Momn\u00e1s are classed together in the census returns, they are in many respects distinct. Hindus of the Khatri caste, weavers by occupation, the T\u00e1is are said to have taken their name from a class of Musalm\u00e1n weavers of that name in Benares. Sunnis in religion, their conversion is said to date from the reign of Mahmud Begada (1459-1511). They are at present all weavers, and intermarry with the lower class of Sunni Musalm\u00e1ns. At their homes they speak Gujar\u00e1ti, and both men and women dress like Hindus.\n\nMomn\u00e1s or Momins, that is, believers, are Shi\u00e1s in religion. Originally of several different castes, carpenters, blacksmiths, and weavers, Momn\u00e1s, at present, besides weaving, follow many callings, carpenters, blacksmiths, bricklayers, calico-printers, and carriage drivers. They were converted about 300 years ago by a Musalm\u00e1n saint of the name of Kabir-nd-din, whose disciples they still are. They are a quiet people, very religious, moderately well off, and about the most industrious of the converted classes. At their homes they speak Gujar\u00e1ti, and both men and women dress like Hindus, the men in some cases shaving the beard.\n\nOf the total P\u00e1rsi population of sixty-eight souls, seven were settled in the Th\u00e1sra sub-division, forty in Mehmadabad, two in M\u00e1tar, fifteen in Nadi\u00e1d, two in A'nand, and two in Borsad. Exclusive of fourteen women and thirty-one children, the adult male population were employed in 1872 chiefly as clerks in Government and Railway offices.\n\nOf the three hundred and five Christians, all, except the European residents, are native converts. Kh\u00e1siv\u00e1di, or the beautiful village in the Borsad sub-division, begun in 1847, with two families, has now (1877) thirty-one families of one hundred and twenty-one souls. Except a stamp vendor, a contractor, and the agents of the mission, the people are cultivators and weavers. In 1843, two Hindus of the Kal\u00e1l or liquor-selling class, told the Surat missionaries of the London Society, that many of the people of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha had a strong wish to become Christians. In consequence of this two members of the Surat mission, Messrs. Flower and Clarkson, came to the Mahi K\u00e1ntha. At first they settled in Baroda, but meeting with\n\n\u00b9 Gov. Sel., CXIV., 311.\nopposition, they moved into British territory and started settlements at Dehv\u00e1n and Borsad. That at Dehv\u00e1n did not succeed, but in Borsad, besides Kh\u00e1siv\u00e1di, with its thirty-one families, the devotion of the Rev. J.V.S. Taylor, who lived there for twenty-eight years, has been rewarded by the steady growth of the Kh\u00e1siv\u00e1di village, and by the establishment of Christian communities in about sixty other villages of the Borsad and A'nand sub-divisions.\u00b9 Though the first Christians were P\u00e1tid\u00e1rs, Kolis, and Kal\u00e1ls, and a few Brahm\u00e1ns, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, Bhays\u00e1rs, and Tal\u00e1vi\u00e1s, the mass of the converts has come from the Dhed caste. Since their conversion, though caste-feeling has lingered in the minds of several, there has been some intermarriage of castes. V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s have married girls belonging to P\u00e1tid\u00e1r and Koli families; P\u00e1tid\u00e1rs have married Koli and Dhed girls; Kolis have married Dhed and Tal\u00e1via girls; and Dheds have married Koli girls. The discipline in the Christian villages is ecclesiastic. Till they show signs of repentance, those who openly lead immoral lives may not join in the church communion. Sunday is pretty carefully kept as a day of rest and religious observance. The only ceremonial occasions are at baptism, communion, marriage, and death, when the rites are according to the rules of the Presbyterian Church. The expenses on such occasions are left entirely to the people's pleasure. Sometimes, both among the poor and the well-to-do, on a wedding nothing more than from 10s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 5-10) for the wedding dress is spent. Occasionally the friends of the bride and the bridegroom are asked to a social meal, and rarely the invitation is extended to the whole community. The use of animal food is allowed. But owing to its cost few people indulge in it. Intoxicating drinks are strongly discouraged, and drunkenness is most uncommon. Opium is forbidden, and from their cost few families use tea or coffee. The monthly expenditure on food is estimated to vary from 8s. (Rs. 4) a head in a well-to-do, to 3s. (Rs. 1-8-0) a head in a poor family. Except for a slight improvement in cleanliness, Christians dress as they used to do when they were Hindus, poor families spending from 10s. to 12s. (Rs. 5-6), and the well-to-do from \u00a31 to \u00a31-10s. (Rs. 10-15) a year. All children are taught to read and write. The amusements of the young are such as are common among Hindus, bat and ball and other simple games. Talk is the adults' one pastime, though some of it is light and some scandalous, a good deal is religious. No one has shown special musical talent, but many are fond of music, and have learned several European airs.\u00b2\n\nExcept in the Th\u00e1sra and Kapadvanj sub-divisions, where small hamlets are numerous, the people are collected in large towns and villages. In this district there is one village or town to about every\n\n\u00b9 The communities vary in strength from one to twelve families. In the year 1861 an off-shoot from Borsad migrated to Sh\u00e1b\u00e1v\u00e1di near Ahmedabad, others to Gogha, Surat, and Rajkot. According to the latest mission census (1878) the total population of native Christians in Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war numbers 847 or with 893 unbaptised adherents a total community of 1740 souls. Of these 1168 were in Kaira, 487 in the Borsad, and 679 in the A'nand sub-division.\u2014Irish Presbyterian Mission Report, 1878, 7.\n\n\u00b2 Contributed by the Rev. J. V. S. Taylor.\nthree square miles of land, each village containing an average of 1333 inhabitants, and about 372 houses. Many villages were once walled, but the fortifications of most are now in ruins. With the exception of the people of thirteen towns, numbering 137,297 souls or 17\u00b754 per cent of the entire inhabitants, the population of the Kaira district, according to the census returns of 1872, lived in 574 villages, with an average of 1124 souls per village. Five towns had more than 10,000, and eight more than 5000 inhabitants. Excluding the thirteen towns and 518 hamlets, there were 574 inhabited state and alienated villages, giving an average of 0\u00b736 villages to each square mile, and 1333\u00b744 inhabitants to each village. Of the whole number of villages, forty-eight had less than 200 inhabitants; one hundred and thirty-four from 200 to 500; one hundred and fifty-two from 500 to 1000; one hundred and fifty-one from 1000 to 2000; fifty-nine from 2000 to 3000; and thirty from 3000 to 5000. As regards the number of houses, there was in 1872 a total of 218,596 or on an average 136\u00b762 houses to the square mile, showing compared with 150,628 in 1846 an increase of 45\u00b712 per cent. Of the total number, 65,685 houses lodging 208,583 persons, or 26\u00b765 per cent of the entire population at the rate of 3\u00b718 souls to each house were buildings with walls of fire-baked bricks and roofs of tile. The remaining 152,911 houses, accommodating 554,150 persons or 73\u00b735 per cent with a population per house of 3\u00b775 souls, included all buildings covered with thatch or leaves or whose outer walls were of mud or sun-dried brick. The mud and thatch huts are found chiefly in the hamlets and small villages; towns and large villages showing a great number of well-built and prosperous looking dwellings. Besides the increase in the number of houses, there has, during the last thirty years, especially among the Kolis, been a marked advance in the style of building, and now the cheapening of the supplies of stone and timber by the opening of the railway to the Mahi will do much to help house-building. The Koli hamlets in the east of the district and along the banks of the Mahi were in 1844 almost entirely straw huts. In 1876 an inquiry made by the Collector showed that in thirty-four Koli villages, of a total of 6281 houses, 92 were of the first, 5043 of the second, and only 1146 of the third or straw-hut class. Another class had in 1844 already done much to improve their houses. These were Br\u00e1hmans, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, and other Hindus of capital, who under the former Government had from fear of exaction been careful to give no sign of their possession of wealth.\n\nUnder land tenures some description will be found of the constitution of the two classes of villages, the simple or senja, and the sharehold or narv\u00e1d\u00e1ri. Village servants belong to two classes; those useful to Government, and those useful to the village community. Under the first head come the village headmen; the revenue headman, ughr\u00e1td\u00e1r, or collector; the police, mukhi, or chief; the village accountant, tal\u00e1ti; watchmen or messengers, r\u00e1vani\u00e1s and rakh\u00e1s; the tracker, pagi; and sweepers and police of the Dhed and Bhangia castes. Village headmen are as a rule hereditary. In Th\u00e1sra, Kapadvanj, and Mehm\u00e9dadabad, there are more Koli villages\nthan in other parts of the district, and in these the headman is usually a Koli. In others, the headmen are Musalm\u00e1ns, Rajputs, and occasionally Br\u00e1hmans and V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, but the majority are Kanbis. The r\u00e1van\u00edt\u00e1s, or village watchmen and messengers, wear belts and are paid sometimes in land and sometimes in money. The duties of pag\u00eds, rakh\u00e1s, and bhangi\u00e1s, vary considerably in different villages. Besides his regular work as a tracker, the pag\u00ed is in some villages a watchman. The rakh\u00e1s do duty as police and watchmen. The Bhangi\u00e1s are sweepers, carriers of dead animals, and guides.\u00b9 Except the village accountant or tal\u00e1t\u00ed, who receives only money, village servants are paid either in cash or land or in both.\u00b2 The servants useful to the village community are the village priest, gh\u00e1mot or bhat; the potter, kumbh\u00e1r; the barber, hajd\u00e1m; the blacksmith, luh\u00e1r; the carpenter, suth\u00e1r; the tailor, darj\u00ed; and the water-drawer, kosio. These men are paid by the villages in grain and cash. The potter, the barber, and the blacksmith also enjoy Government land on payment of one quarter to one-half of the full rent. Every village has its headman, its accountant, its messengers, its priest, its watchmen, and its sweepers. The extent to which any village supports the other members of the complete staff depends on its size and its distance from large villages or country towns. Though some villages are called p\u00e1tid\u00e1ri or sharehold, that is Kunbi, and others, dh\u00e1r\u00e1l\u00e1\u00b3 or armed, that is Koli, the whole of the people do not in any case belong to one caste. Besides cultivators of different castes, few villages are without a shopkeeper, either a V\u00e1nia or a Br\u00e1hman.\n\nThirty-four years ago (1844) the Kaira people are described as most unwilling to leave their villages. They were said never to move unless forced by extreme poverty or inability to pay their debts. Eleven years later (1855) when the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were transferred to the Bombay Government, the Kaira Collector complained that in spite of the most advantageous offers none but a few discontented individuals were willing to take land. Though this dislike to moving is still true of the bulk of the people, the increased pressure of population and the easier means of travelling have united to make considerable sections of the Kaira population willing to leave the district in search of work. Of the higher classes, some Bohor\u00e1s and V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s go as traders as far as Bombay and Poona. These men generally leave their families behind them, returning to them when they can,\n\n\u00b9 Details of the position and duties of the different classes of village servants are given in the Broach Statistical Account.\u2014Bombay Gazetteer, II., 381-387.\n\u00b2 Capt. Cruikshank (20th December, 1826) in his Nadi\u00e1d Survey Report says:\u2014\"The blacksmith, luh\u00e1r, receives annually from each cultivator fifty pounds of grain per plough, and in return keeps all agricultural implements in repair.\" The carpenter, suth\u00e1r, receives in like manner, and on the like conditions, sixty pounds; the potter, kumbh\u00e1r, forty pounds; the tailor, darj\u00ed, forty pounds; and the barber, valand, forty pounds. At all village marriages the blacksmith brings a small iron lamp or l\u00edmandiv\u00f3, receiving two shillings in return; the carpenter brings a b\u00e1jat or wooden stool, and is paid two shillings; the potter supplies earthen pots for the marriage feast and gets three shillings. The tailor brings no offering, but receives upon the marriage of a boy one shilling, and upon that of a girl two and half pence. The barber is paid three shillings upon the marriage of a shareholder, p\u00e1tid\u00e1ri, and two shillings upon that of a Koli.\"\n\u00b3 Dh\u00e1r\u00e1l\u00e1, an armed man.\u2014K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Sel., Part I., 4.\nbringing their savings to spend in their native town, and in their place of trade owning nothing but their office and its scanty necessary furniture. Others of the educated classes move to Bombay, Baroda, and R\u00e1jkot, in search of Government or other employ. Like the merchant, they keep a house in their native town. But unlike him, they generally take their families with them. Of artisans, carpenters, sawyers, and brickmakers, go every fair season to the Baroda and Broach districts, offering their services to house builders. By this means they generally earn a good sum of money, living on an allowance of grain, and taking back with them almost the whole of their money wages. Of personal servants, many barbers leaving their families at home, go to Surat and Bombay and stay there for one or two years at a time. Of carriers there are the Musalm\u00e1n Gh\u00e1nchis or oilmen, who in four-or-five-pair bullock wagons take large quantities of tobacco to Ratl\u00e1m, Indor, and M\u00e1lwa, bringing back wheat and mahuda flowers, and the Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s on their pack bullocks, bringing wheat and Indian corn from M\u00e1lwa and taking back salt. Of the lower classes, besides the professional wanderers, the religious beggars, the Ods or wandering diggers, and the shepherds, unskilled field labourers to some extent, move about the district in search of work. During the year these men find employment in three different places; in September and October, in the M\u00e1ter rice lands; in January, in the cotton districts south of the Mahi and west of Cambay; and in March, in the Ahmedabad wheat country. These labourers, Kolis, Bhils, and Dheds, have of late years, by the use of steam gins, lost their best paid employment, the hand ginning of cotton. In former times, after about four months of cotton ginning, a man and his wife and one or two children used to come back with savings amounting to nearly \u00a310 (Rs. 100).\n\n1 A'hand M\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's Report (1876).\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nAgriculture, the most important industry of the district, supports 529,334 persons or 67\u00b762 per cent of the entire population.\u00b9\n\nThe soils of the district are of four chief kinds, light or gor\u00e1t, medium or besar, black or k\u00e1li, and alluvial or bh\u00e1tha. For agricultural purposes each of these main classes includes several varieties. The light or gor\u00e1t is the prevailing soil, varying in quality from the loose grained yellow sand of the fields near the S\u00e1harmati and the Mahi to a rich light-brown mould, common in the central sub-divisions, and found to perfection in the south-west corner of M\u00e1tar. The richer variety, known as gor\u00e1du besar, contains a large proportion of organic matter, and seems to a great extent to be artificial, the result of the careful tillage of the Kanbi cultivators. Under medium or besar, come several soils, varying from heavy sands to light clays. Soils of this class are pretty generally distributed over the whole district, though nowhere over any large area. Under black or k\u00e1li, come a clayey sedimentary soil that collects in low lands and ponds; the salt or kh\u00e1r,\u00b2 and the cotton land in the south-west of M\u00e1tar; the rice land in the north near the Kh\u00e1ri river; the waste and ill-drained m\u00e1l or upland, in Kapadvanj and Th\u00e1sra; and a coarse, shallow, and dry soil, called mardi, found near the river Mahi. As a rule, the Kaira black soil is poor. It is scarcely ever deep, and is most of it mixed either with soda or limestone. Alluvial soil or bh\u00e1tha is chiefly found near the V\u00e1trak river. This, without dressing or fallow, yields year after year rich crops of tobacco, safflower, and other garden produce.\n\n\u00b9 This total (529,334) is made up of the following items:\n   (1) Adult males engaged in agriculture as per census of 1872 ... 176,651\n   (2) Wives of ditto calculated on the basis of the proportion the total adult female population of the district bears to the total adult male population ... 159,144\n   (3) Children of 1 and 2 calculated on a similar basis ... 193,539\n   Total ... 529,334\n\nThis calculation is necessary because the census returns, including many of the women under VII. (Miscellaneous), show a total of only 112 under the special head Adult Agricultural Females.\n\n\u00b2 At the time of the last survey (1862) between Limb\u00e1si and Ch\u00e1nor, in the west of M\u00e1tar, was a wide tract of black soil, covered with a hoar frost or snow-like crust, called kh\u00e1r. This tract was supposed to have been once subject to flooding at spring tides. In 1862 the salt or kh\u00e1r crust was said to be encroaching, and to appear in ill-drained lands where rain-water stagnated.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 417,441.\nThe state or kh\u00e1lsa villages of the district contain 935,541 acres, of which 345,016 acres or 36\u00b787 per cent are alienated, paying only a quit-rent to the state, and 109,982 acres or 11\u00b775 per cent are unarable waste. The total area of state arable land is therefore 480,543 acres, of which 387,711 acres or 80\u00b768 per cent are occupied; and 92,832 or 19\u00b732 per cent are unoccupied. Of this 92,832 acres of unoccupied arable land, 5665 acres including grazing lands, homesteads, and burial places cannot be taken up for cultivation. The whole available area of unoccupied arable land is therefore reduced to 87,167 acres or 18\u00b713 per cent of the total state arable land. Most of the unoccupied arable land consists of the poor tracts in M\u00e1tar in the west, and in Th\u00e1sra and Kapadvanj in the east of the district. Of the 387,711 occupied acres, 25,779 or 6\u00b764 per cent consist of garden land; 58,404 or 15\u00b707 per cent of rice land; 303,528 or 78\u00b729 per cent of dry crop land. Of the rice land, 18,658 acres are irrigated, and 39,746 acres unirrigated.\n\nIn the M\u00e1tar sub-division, except from the Kh\u00e1ri of which some account has been given above, irrigation is carried on chiefly from wells and ponds. After the close of the cold season almost none of the ponds hold any large supply of water. They can therefore be used only for irrigating rice lands. The depth of the water-bearing strata varies much in different parts of the district. Averaging thirty-five feet in the west or M\u00e1tar sub-division, in some low-lying lands in Nadi\u00e1d it is only twenty-five feet from the surface. In the north it averages about forty-five feet, and in the south, along the Mahi, varies from 70 to 140 feet. In the parts of \u00c1nand and Borsad bordering on the Mahi, the heavy cost of wells and a certain brackishness in the water prevent any large amount of well-irrigation, and though in ordinary years the crops are but little less valuable than those on irrigated lands in seasons of scanty or ill-timed rain, the want of water is keenly felt. The chief irrigated crops are rice, tobacco, wheat, sugarcane, and garden produce. In 1876-77, of the total cultivated area, 42,585 acres or 12\u00b747 per cent were irrigated. Of the irrigated land, 17,758 acres were under rice. In that year the returns showed 104 wells with steps, 9237 wells without steps, 531 water-lifts or dhekudis, and 4600 ponds. The wells most commonly in use in Kaira are r\u00e1mia or deep, the sundia or shallow being found only in a part of the M\u00e1tar sub-division. The r\u00e1mia wells yield at one time from two to eight kos or leather bags full of water, and the sundia from two to four. From most Kaira wells four leather bags can be drawn at a time.\u00b9\n\nIn light sandy fields the area one pair of bullocks can plough varies from nine acres for the common dry crops to six acres for\n\n\u00b9 The present (1877) estimates for sinking wells, based on the cultivators' statements, are for a brick and mortar-built well from thirty to sixty feet deep for one water bag \u00a330 to \u00a368 (Rs. 300-680) and for two water bags \u00a340 to \u00a380 (Rs. 400-800). A ninety-feet deep brick-built well for one bag would cost \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000), for two \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500.) Kundal wells with wooden foundations and sides of baked clay rings, can only be sunk from thirty to fifty feet; they cost half as much as a brick and mortar well. Water can be drawn from holes dug in river beds at a cost of from 10s. to 21 10s. (Rs. 5-15).\ngarden or other high-class tillage. In black soil the corresponding area is for wheat and cotton twenty-five acres, for safflower and tobacco ten acres, and for rice five acres.\n\nThe following statement shows, in acres, the average size of a holding ascertained at the time (1861-1867) of the introduction of the existing survey leases:\n\n| Size | Borsad. | Kapadvanj. | A'nand. | Mehmada-bad. | Matar. | Th\u00e1sra. | Nadi\u00e1d. |\n|------|---------|------------|---------|--------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Average acreage of farms | 10\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) | 9\\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) | 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 7\\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) | 6\\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) | 6\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) | 5\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) |\n\nThis, as was to be expected in a district with so crowded an agricultural population, shows a low average holding. A peasant's family cannot, it is estimated, be kept in comfort on less than three acres of garden, five of rice land, and eight of dry crops. Cultivators with smaller holdings eke out the profits of their fields by working as labourers on the lands of their richer neighbours.\n\nDuring the years (1861-1867) of the present settlement, 104,009 distinct holdings or kh\u00e1tas were recorded with an average area of 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) acres, and a rental of \u00a31 15s. 6d. (Rs. 17-12-0). These holdings would represent, if divided in equal parts among the agricultural population, for each person an allotment of two acres, at a yearly rent of 9s. 8d. (Rs. 4-13-4). If distributed among the whole population of the district, the share per head would amount to 1\\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) acres, and the incidence of the land tax to 6s. 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. (Rs. 3-3-0). In 1875-76 the total number of holdings, including private or alienated villages and the estates of superior land-holders, was 107,918. Of the total number, 62,501 or more than one-half were holdings of not more than five acres in area.\\(^1\\)\n\n**Kaira Holding Details, 1875-76.**\n\n| Acres | Mehmada-bad. | Kapadvanj. | Nadi\u00e1d. | Th\u00e1sra. | A'nand. | Borsad. | Matar. | Total. |\n|-------|--------------|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|\n| 0     |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 5     |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 10    |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 20    |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 30    |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 40    |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 50    |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 60    |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 70    |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 80    |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 90    |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 100   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 110   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 120   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 130   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 140   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 150   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 160   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 170   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 180   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 190   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| 200   |              |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| Above 200 |          |            |         |         |         |         |        |        |\n| Total | 12,779       | 12,724     | 22,631  | 14,640  | 17,028  | 18,321  | 14,795 | 107,918|\n\n\\(^1\\) Revenue Commissioner's 814, March 1st, 1877. Most of the holdings of 200 acres and upwards are the estates of superior landholders.\nDuring the year 1877-78, 109,009 distinct holdings or kh\u0101tas were recorded, with an average area of 6\u00bd acres, and rental of \u00a31 15s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 17-15-0). These holdings, if divided in equal parts among the agricultural population, would represent an allotment of two acres and two gunt\u0101s, at a yearly rent of 11s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 5-9-0). If distributed amongst the whole population of the district, the share per head would amount to one acre and thirteen gunt\u0101s, and the incidence of the land tax to 7s. 5\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-11-10).\n\nAccording to the Collector's administration report for 1876-77, the agricultural stock in Government or kh\u0101lsa villages amounted to 56,467 ploughs, 28,791 carts, 128,247 bullocks, 49,264 cows, 190,538 buffaloes, 2366 horses, 53,880 sheep and goats, and 6325 asses.\n\nAs the details of agricultural processes, crops, and cost of cultivation, given in the general chapter on the agriculture of Gujar\u0101t apply to Kaira, only a few points of local importance are noticed in this place.\n\nOf 362,222 acres the total area of occupied land, 20,754 acres or 5\u00b778 per cent were in the year 1876-77 fallow or under grass. Of the 341,468 acres\u00b9 under cultivation, grain crops occupied 301,709 or 88\u00b737 per cent, of which 123,223 acres were under b\u0101jri, Penicillaria spicata; 58,898 under rice, d\u0101ngar, Oryza sativa; 38,845 under j\u016bv\u0101r, Sorghum vulgare; 36,544 under kodra, Paspalum scrobiculatum; 29,261 under b\u0101vto, Panicum frumentaceum; 11,251 under wheat, ghau, Triticum aestivum; 3231 under barley, jav, Hordeum hexastichon; and 456 under miscellaneous cereals, comprising maize, male\u00e1i, Zea mays, k\u00e1ng, Panicum italicum, and r\u0101jagro, Amaranthus paniculatus. Pulses occupied 27,082 acres or 7\u00b793 per cent, of which 8255 acres were under math, Phaseolus aconitifolius; 6825 under tuver, Cajanus indicus; 5148 under gram, chana, Cicer arietinum; 2678 under mag, Phaseolus radiatus; 1933 under guv\u0101r, Cyamopsis psoraloides; and 2243 under miscellaneous pulses, comprising adad, Phaseolus mungo, chola, Vigna catiangu and v\u00e1l, Dolichos lablab.

The most remarkable advance is in the breadth of rice and wheat tillage; the rice increasing 24,976 acres or 73\u00b763 per cent, and the wheat 4151 acres or 58\u00b746 per cent. Other kinds of cereals and pulses have in the aggregate increased by 87,820 acres or 51\u00b746. The area under safflower has risen by 1973 acres or 183 per cent, that under indigo by 176 acres or 48\u00b789 per cent, and that under sugarcane by 429 acres or 24 per cent. On the other hand cotton is less by 1134 acres or 21\u00b757 per cent, and tobacco by 466 acres or 4\u00b738 per cent.\n\nAmong the district crops common millet, bajri, Penicillaria spicata, holds the first place with in 1876-77, 123,223 acres or 36\u00b708 per cent of the whole tillage area. Compared with 1859-60 the returns for 1876-77 show an increase of millet cultivation amounting to 21,017 acres or 20\u00b756 per cent. Millet is grown in all the lighter or gorat soils. It is sown in June and reaped in the latter part of September. With it are grown math, Phaseolus aconitifolius; mag, Phaseolus radiatus, and other pulses, which, taking longer to ripen, remain in the field a month after the millet crop has been reaped. Their growth seems not to interfere with the growth of the millet, and the double crop has this advantage, that often when the millet fails the pulse yields freely. The parts of the district best\n\n---\n\n1 In 1859-60 pulses seem to have been included in grains, and oil seeds in vegetables and spices. Poppy and hemp were not shown separately.\nsuited for millet are the poorer soils, especially near the banks of the Mahi. The straw, though not so valuable as Indian millet, *juv\u00e1r*, straw, is generally used as fodder for cattle. Millet is the people's staple grain and their principal article of food.\n\n*Kodra*, Paspalum scrobiculatum, and *b\u00e1vto*, Panicum frumentaceum, hold the second place with in 1876-77, 65,805 acres or 19\u00b727 per cent of the whole tillage area. Grown chiefly by the poorer cultivators, *kodra* and *b\u00e1vto* along with common millet, *b\u00e1jri*, form the staple food of the lower classes.\n\nRice, *d\u00e1ngar*, Oryza sativa, holds the third place with in 1876-77, 58,898 acres or 17\u00b724 per cent of the whole tillage area. Compared with 1859-60 the returns for 1876-77 show an increase of rice cultivation amounting to 24,976 acres or 73\u00b763 per cent. The best rice is raised in the Kh\u00e1ri villages of the M\u00e1tar sub-division. These lands are of black soil, the fields embanked, and most of them watered from the Kh\u00e1ri canal. The young plants, sown about the middle of June in richly manured nurseries, are moved into the fields in July and August. For about two months, until the ear begins to show, much water is wanted, and if the direct rainfall is scanty, supplies must be drawn from wells and ponds. In other parts of the district, rice of an inferior quality is, without watering, grown in low-lying lands of black or medium, *besur*, soil. This unirrigated variety covering in 1876, 37,767 acres or 64\u00b712 per cent of the whole area under rice cultivation, is a coarse grain used chiefly for local consumption.\n\nIndian millet, *juv\u00e1r*, Sorghum vulgare, holds the fourth place with in 1876-77, 38,845 acres or 11\u00b737 per cent of the whole tillage area. In Kaira common millet, *b\u00e1jri*, takes the place of Indian millet, *juv\u00e1r*, which is less grown than in south Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nWheat, though still a crop of little importance, has spread from 7071 acres in 1860 to 11,251 acres in 1876. It is sown from the beginning of October to the end of November and reaped in March. Three sorts are grown, *D\u00e1udkh\u00e1n* or *dudh\u00eda*, a high class wheat, smooth-grained and white; *dhola* or *k\u00e1tha*, a low class wheat, hard and brown; and a medium variety, *dh\u00e1lia* or *vaj\u00eda*. The high class or *dudh\u00eda*, wheat grows only in black soil. For a good harvest the field should be fallow both before and after its wheat crop. It should be ploughed from three to ten times, and unless the soil is of the best it should be manured. This sort of wheat requires forty pounds of seed to sow an acre. The middling, *vaj\u00eda*, and the poor, *dhola*, grow either in black or in sandy-black soil. For a good yield, except in the best black soils, manure is wanted, but neither before nor after cropping is a fallow required. To sow an acre they both want sixty pounds of seed. The local wheat produce is not enough for the local demand. Supplies are brought from Ahmedabad and M\u00e1lwa and by rail from Bombay.\n\nTobacco holds the sixth place with in 1876-77, 10,161 acres or 2\u00b797 per cent of the whole tillage area. Compared with 1859-60 the returns for 1876-77 show a decrease of 466 acres or 4\u00b738 per cent. Kaira tobacco is not only the most valuable article of produce in the district, but is the finest tobacco grown in western...\nChapter IV.\nAgriculture.\n\nTobacco.\n\nIndia. The central part of the Kaira district, the tract known as the charotar, is the head quarters of tobacco cultivation. The two chief varieties are the talabdi or local, and the Kh\u00e1ndeshi brought, as its name shows, from Kh\u00e1ndesh. The talabdi or local plant, grows four feet high. Its leaf is large, juicy, and tapering, the ribs and veins heavy and coarse, the general texture loose, and the colour, when ripe, a somewhat dull yellow. It is hardy, growing even in poor soils, and wants but little manure. The Kh\u00e1ndesh tobacco grows about two feet high. Compared with the local variety, its leaf is shorter and narrower, closer grained in texture, and of a deeper and more brilliant colour. A more delicate plant, it requires richer soil and more manure, but on the other hand wants less water. Though its yield is not more than one-third of the yield of the local plant, its higher quality and its smaller demand for water to a considerable extent make up for the small outturn. Tobacco is grown either with or without water. The water need not be perfectly sweet. In fact a slight brackishness is said to improve the quality of the crop. When irrigated the crop is called pit or watered, when not irrigated kor\u00e1t or dry. A watered field yields twice as large a crop as a dry field. At the same time the leaf of the irrigated plant is coarser and not more than one-half as valuable.\n\nLight or gor\u00e1du land is the soil best suited for the growth of the irrigated crop. Towards the end of May, some time before the rains set in, plots of ground are chosen somewhat shaded, well placed for watering, the soil rich and dry. About six inches of brushwood, hay, or dressing, are laid over the plot. When thoroughly dry the whole is burnt and the ashes allowed to lie on the surface. About the beginning of July, as soon as the first rain has fallen, the ashes are ploughed into the ground, or, if there was no dry dressing, the ground is manured and then ploughed. The whole is well cleaned and the surface smoothed. The seed is then sown broadcast, and if, after the young plants come up, there is no rain, they are watered. While the seedlings are growing in their nursery the cultivators are busy getting ready the field. According to the wants of the soil they give each acre from ten to eighteen tons-(twenty to thirty-five cart-loads) of sheep droppings or cowdung, pond mud or dry silt, and sometimes wood ashes. When the manure is laid on, the field is ready for ploughing. With this great pains are taken, as on its depth and thoroughness the outturn greatly depends. Ploughing, ch\u00e1s, and clod crushing, sam\u00e1r, are repeated from eight to ten times. Each time the line of ploughing varies. First it runs from north to south, next from east to west, then from north-east to south-west, and so on, starting in turn from every quarter of the compass. Between each ploughing the clods are crushed and the surface smoothed. Finally, the whole field is cleaned by the harrow or karabdi. The seedlings are generally ready for planting in the\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel., New Series, CXIV., 145.\n2 Every tobacco-yielding village has its one or more tobacco nurseries or vadd\u00e1s, in which almost all the chief men share.\nlatter part of August. A nursery of one acre should yield plants sufficient to stock from twenty to forty acres. In moving them from their places in the nursery the young plants are taken up carefully with a knife or trowel, as much earth as possible being left about their roots. At the seed bed they are laid slanting in a basket and carried to the field. They are set in the ground in rows, the rows and the plants in each row distant from each other about eighteen inches for an irrigated and two feet for a dry crop. In setting each plant in its place the lower leaves are pinched off, and when the sun is strong, until the plant takes root, they have for some days to be shaded with twigs or large leaves. During its growth the Kh\u0101ndesh tobacco should be thrice watered. The Kaira variety wants more moisture, from five to twelve waterings, according as the well is perfectly sweet or more or less brackish. When nearly full grown the plants begin to show signs of flowering. These tops or flower stems are carefully picked off, and the whole of the plant's strength driven to its eight to twelve well grown and juicy leaves.\n\nA growing field of tobacco is apt to suffer from several causes. Perhaps its chief enemy is the caterpillar, whose attacks are so constant, that every night and morning, until the leaves begin to change colour, they have to be searched and the insects picked off. Besides the caterpillar other insects hurt the tobacco. One worm attacks the root and withers the plant, bringing on the disease called chith; another worm, eating into the stem and joints, stops the growth and brings on the disease called ganthor. Again, any extremes of drought, heat, or cold injure the crop. With too much dry weather the disease chanchdi appears, and the leaves covered with spots wither. Too much damp brings over the whole plant a white coating called charu, robbing the leaves of much of their pungency. Finally, there is the chance of frost, which, when it comes, blights the whole field. The time a field of tobacco takes to ripen depends on whether it has been watered. A dry crop ripens in five and a watered crop in seven months. When the leaves turn yellow and droop the crop is cut. A few stalks, about forty to an acre, are allowed to flower and their seed is gathered for the next year's sowing. Tobacco is prepared in two ways, a coarser sort for smoking, called kalio, and a finer, both for smoking and for snuff, called jardo. To make kalio the stem is cut close to the root and well dried by often turning it in the sun. If the stalks are very thick, to help the drying they are split down the middle. When the plants are well dried, generally after four or five days' sunning, they are housed or removed to the curing shed. Here they are sorted, the soiled lower and the small upper leaves are placed in one heap, and the rich middle leaves in another. Next, the leaves of each heap are made up in small bundles called padas, the largest and strongest leaves being used as wrappers or covers and the smaller ones placed in the middle. The bundles, each of which weighs from one to three pounds, are then piled up and covered with matting for three days to ferment or 'sweat.' Then they are separated and again heaped for a second sweating, and afterwards, at intervals of a week, the fermenting is repeated from four to six times. Great care and attention are\nrequired at the time of fermentation, as if it is either checked too soon or allowed to go on too long the tobacco is much injured. To manufacture jardo tobacco, the leaves are, by means of a crooked knife called hariyu, taken off the stems along with the skin and a little of the wood. They are then exposed to the sun from ten to fifteen days. Each day, in the early morning, while still damp with dew, they are taken to a shed. Here they are sorted into better and poorer kinds and made into bundles or pad\u00e1s. If, at the time of bundling, the leaves are found to be too dry and brittle, a small quantity of water is sprinkled over them. Fermentation or sweating is only once brought on. But if the first is imperfect, a second becomes necessary. The bundles or pad\u00e1s are ready for sale about a fortnight after they have been made up. K\u00e1l\u00edo is used for smoking only, and jardo for smoking as well as for chewing. K\u00e1l\u00edo is so strong and full of flavour that it is seldom or never used for smoking without being mixed with molasses paste. In its simple state jardo tobacco is used only for smoking in cigarettes, bid\u00eds, and in small pipes. Cigarettes are usually rolled in the leaves of the ashimdra or jinji, Bauhinia speciosa, and sometimes in plantain leaves. In spite of its good qualities Kaira tobacco is still prepared only for native consumption. Attempts have been made to have it rolled in cigar form suited for the European market. But so far the results have been discouraging. Snuff is prepared chiefly from jardo, though k\u00e1l\u00edo is occasionally mixed with it in the proportion of one part to three. Snuff may either be made entirely of the leaf, or of the leaf and mid-rib together. The bundles are first torn in pieces, and afterwards sprinkled with a solution of carbonate of soda dissolved by boiling in water. The tobacco is thrown into a heap to ferment, and then well dried in the sun and pounded in a mortar to the required fineness. The following are the estimates of the cost and profit of cultivating the local and the Kh\u00e1ndesh tobacco.\n\nFor an acre of local or talabdi, watered from a brackish well, tillage including, \u00a31 (Rs. 10); rent, \u00a36 (Rs. 60); watering, \u00a39 5s. (Rs. 92-8); value, \u00a327 (Rs. 270); profit, \u00a310 15s. (Rs. 107-8). For an acre of local, watered from a sweet well, tillage including, \u00a31 (Rs. 10); rent, \u00a36 (Rs. 60); watering, \u00a34 17s. 6d. (Rs. 48-12); value, \u00a313 10s. (Rs. 135); profit, \u00a312 12s. 6d. (Rs. 126-4). For an acre of Kh\u00e1ndesh, watered from a brackish well, tillage including, \u00a31 (Rs. 10); rent, \u00a36 (Rs. 60); watering, \u00a32 18s. 6d. (Rs. 29-4); value, \u00a318 (Rs. 180); profit, \u00a39 1s. 6d. (Rs. 90-12). For an acre of Kh\u00e1ndesh, watered from a sweet well, tillage including, \u00a31 (Rs. 10); rent, \u00a36 (Rs. 60); watering, \u00a32 18s. 6d. (Rs. 29-4); value, \u00a315 (Rs. 150); profit, \u00a36 1s. 6d. (Rs. 60-12).\n\nCotton, kap\u00e1s, Gossypium herbaceum, is cultivated only to a limited extent, 381\u00bd acres in 1872 compared with 5256 acres in 1859. The plant grown is chiefly the perennial variety, locally called roj\u00ed. Raised in light, gor\u00e1t and medium, bes\u00e1r soils it is sown in July, and picked from the middle of January till the end of March. It occupies every seventh furrow in fields sown with millet, bajr\u012b, and pulse, math.\n\n1 Collector, 1603, 18th July 1876.\nCotton of the yearly sort is grown to a small extent in the black soil villages bordering on Cambay. Though its produce is inferior in value to the outturn of the yearly variety of cotton, the three years' plant has this advantage, that as its roots draw moisture from below the surface, they do not interfere with the surface roots of the grain and pulse crops. The plant is allowed to grow till the end of May, when its branches are lopped about a foot from the ground. At the end of the third year, the roots are dug out. This cotton is not worth more than one-half of the one year sort. The field is manured only once in three years. As a rule the field that has yielded cotton does not again bear the same crop till after three years are over.\n\nThough with little success, several attempts have been made to improve Kaira cotton. In 1815, under the superintendence of the civil surgeon Mr. Gilders about 2400 acres were sown with Bourbon seed. About one-half promised well, but, though the local variety yielded a good crop, most of the Bourbon failed. The failure was supposed to be due chiefly to want of moisture, but the saltiness of the land was also noticed as likely to harm a crop which does not come to perfection for two years. A bale of cotton, the produce of these experiments, consigned to London in 1816, realized 1s. 5d. the pound, or 2d. the pound more than the best Surat. The staple was considered rather fine and generally saleable. Mr. Gilders was authorized to make a further trial, if necessary, with the aid of irrigation. A place was chosen further east in light sandy loam. After the first heavy rains, at the end of July, the seed was sown. Three feet were left between each plant, and between each row, like the plants three feet apart, millet, bajri, was sown. The late rains were scanty, and until July 1817 the plants remained dwarfed and sickly. Then without watering they shot out so freely that one-half of them had to be picked out. Even then they were too crowded, and Mr. Gilders considered that eight feet was the proper distance between each shrub. The yield from about fourteen acres was 1760 pounds of clean cotton. The parcel was most favourably received in Bombay and valued at 2s. 3d. the pound. The London brokers thought it the best Bombay-Bourbon they had seen. It was fine, silky, with an even fair length staple of good bright colour, remarkably clean with a small portion of broken leaf and crushed seed and a few yellow spots.\u00b9\n\nWith other Indian cotton at from 5\u00bdd. to 1\u00bcd. a pound it fetched 1s. 3d. In spite of this high price so great was the cost of tillage that the transaction showed a loss of twenty-eight per cent. In 1839 Dr. Burn, then in charge of the Government garden at Kaira, made some experiments in growing cotton. He tried Egyptian, two kinds of Broach, and acclimated Bourbon. Some of this acclimated Bourbon, found in the hedgerows near where Mr. Gilders had grown it in 1816, was both by the Agricultural Society of Calcutta and the Bombay Chamber of Commerce placed equal to the best New Orleans and valued at from \u00a317 to \u00a318 (Rs. 170-180), while the best Surat was selling at \u00a314 (Rs. 140).\u00b2 In 1842 some of the American cotton seed, sent out by the Court of Directors, was\n\n\u00b9 Royle's Culture of Cotton, 420-421.\n\u00b2 Cassel's Cotton, 12-13.\nforwarded to the Collector of Kaira for trial in his district. Some of this seed was sown by Dr. Thatcher, then in charge of the Government experimental garden. The soil was light and rather sandy, and every care was given to the crop. The plants promised well, but when about a foot high most of them, though at the time the local variety was thriving, 'withered and died off as if blighted.' A few recovered, but the outturn was very small. Some Egyptian cotton tried in the same garden almost entirely perished. The American seed distributed by the Collector to some cultivators was sown in about six acres in different parts of the district. Till about the middle of September the plants looked most promising. They flowered and formed very large pods. But the heat of October seemed to burn the leaves and more tender branches. They continued in a withered state till the cold weather partially revived them. In about one-third of the area the crop never arrived at maturity. The rest yielded about 162 pounds of clean cotton valued at \u00a31 18s. (Rs. 19), or a loss of sixty-seven per cent on the cost of tillage. Samples examined by the Bombay Chamber of Commerce were found to be well cleaned and tolerably good, but far inferior to American cotton grown in Ratnagiri. For some years after 1842 attempts to grow exotic cotton in Kaira would seem to have been given up. In 1861 nothing but the local three-to-five year shrub was grown. Again, in 1865 and 1866 Dhawar and New Orleans seed was sown. The plants grew about a foot high, but died after the close of the rains. Now (1878), as in 1861, the local shrub is the only cotton grown. Of this there would seem to be two varieties, one called roji said to have been brought from Khandesh about one hundred years ago, the other called kumni brought from Broach about twelve years back. Partly, it is said, because it is allowed to stay four years in the ground, partly because it is sown in fields with several other crops, and partly because the seed has degenerated, Kaira cotton was in 1877 1\u00bdd. or 32 per cent a pound less in value than either Dholera or Broach cotton. It is sent to Dholera, Broach, Surat, and Bombay, but it is said solely for the purpose of mixing with better varieties.\n\nThe cultivation of Safflower, kusumbo, Carthamus tinctorius, is carried on in two sub-divisions, Matar and Mehmadabad. Compared with 1859 the returns for 1876-77 show an advance from 1078 to 3051 acres. The crop is grown not so much for the dyeing power of its flowers as for the oil its seed yields. About one-half of the produce is sent to Kathiawar, Baroda, Broach, and Surat. The rest is used in the district. Safflower thrives in mixed or besar soil. Except in a naturally rich soil, or after a highly manured crop, the land is enriched in June at the rate of ten carts of good dressing to the acre. During the rainy season it receives four ploughings and\n\n---\n\n1 Cassel's Cotton, 80-81.\n2 Cassel's Cotton, 82.\n3 Collector, 2114, 21st Sept. 1878.\n4 Cotton Dept. Ad. Rep. 1876-77, 36.\n5 The average outturn per acre is estimated at 280 pounds weight of flowers worth \u00a31 11s. 6d. (Rs. 15-12) and 400 pounds weight of seed worth \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15). The cost of production is estimated at \u00a31 15s. (Rs. 17-8) and the profit per acre at \u00a31 7s. (Rs. 13-8).\nmore in October or November. The seed, at the rate of seventeen pounds to the acre, is then sown with the drill; and after five or six days, without any watering, the plant springs up. Nothing further is done till in January the flowering begins. Then, at intervals of a day, each pod yields three flowers, and the whole is collected in about a month. The flowers are picked in the cool of the morning. If the picking is stopped, and the first leaves left unplucked, the pod dries and yields no flowers.\n\nIn 1876 the total area under Indigo, *gali*, *Indigofera tinctoria*, was Indigo. 536 acres, 513 in Borsad and 23 in Anand, and even this was considerably in excess of 360 the total in 1859. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, indigo partly of local growth and partly brought from upper India was one of the chief exports from Gujar\u00e1t. During the greater part of the eighteenth century, the indigo of the West Indian islands gained an almost complete monopoly of the European markets. Towards the close of the century the East Indian produce again rose to favour. But nearly the whole of it was grown in Bengal. In Gujar\u00e1t in 1777 the cultivation chiefly for local use would seem to have been on a very considerable scale. But in the early part of the present century it again fell off, and in 1827 had almost altogether ceased. At that time prices were high and the demand was strong, and Captain Cruikshank, then engaged in surveying northern Gujar\u00e1t, was of opinion that by the help of a little special encouragement the people of Kaira might, especially in Petlad, be induced to grow indigo. The attempt failed, and indigo has never again become a product of any importance. This is to be regretted, as, when grown in rotation with other crops, indigo has the merit of leaving the land richer than it found it. The labour and capital required for its production, and the comparatively small profit it yields, are perhaps the chief reasons why indigo is now grown only to so very limited an extent. But another cause is at work. The preparation of the drug is accompanied by much loss of insect life, a result most distasteful to the Kanbi, and since the spread of the Sv\u00e1mi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan sect to many of the Koli cultivators of Kaira. The small quantity now produced is grown in light or gor\u00e1t soil. At the first fall of rain (June) the field should be ploughed more than once, and if possible manured. The seed is sown in drills from the *tarphan* or drill plough. After the plants have come up constant weeding is required. The crop reaches maturity in September, and in gathering the leaves great care must be taken that they are not exposed to wet. The dye is extracted, sometimes from the green leaves and sometimes from the dry. If green, the plants should be taken from the fields early in the morning, and laid in large wooden vats. The vat is then filled with water, and to keep the plants down heavy weights are placed across the top. During the night fermentation sets in. In the morning the water is drawn off into a second vat, where it is well worked with large sticks till it takes a deep blue colour. In this state the liquor is allowed to stand perfectly quiet till the next day. The water is then drawn off into a third vat, and the sediment in the second vat is taken out. It is then tied up tightly in bags and hung from the branches of trees. When dry, it is taken down,\nChapter IV.\nAgriculture.\n\nPoppy.\n\nspread on the floor of a hut, and cut into cakes. The refuse indigo dregs, and also the plants, make very good manure.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn 1876-77, 118 acres\\(^2\\) were under Poppy, *afin*, Papaver somniferum. That the poppy is grown to so small an extent is due to the stringency of the rules regarding its production.\\(^3\\) The light or medium variety is its favourite soil, and a field that has during the rainy season borne a crop of Indian millet is generally chosen. In November or December, after the crop has been removed, the ground is manured several times and watered. The seed called *khashhas* is then sown broadcast. After the plants come up, the land is kept well weeded, and watered every ten days. When the plant is mature, the outer skin of the flower capsule is lightly slit, and the juice allowed to exude. After a day and a night the stem is scraped with a small knife, and the juice collected in earthen pots. The slitting may be repeated a second and a third time, in each case after an interval of three days.\\(^4\\)\n\nBombay Hemp, *san*, Crotalaria juncea, was cultivated in 117 acres. Its seeds are said to be used as food for cattle, its stalks for fuel, and its fibres for ropes.\n\nSugarcane.\n\nSugarcane, *serdi*, Saccharum officinarum, has spread from 1787 acres in 1859-60 to 2216 acres in 1876-77. Kaira sugarcane is of two kinds, one black or dark-purple, the other white. Grown on rich light, *gor\u00e1t* and medium, *besar* soils, it wants free manure and good water, and takes so much from the land, that a second crop cannot be planted till after an interval of four or five years. Though Kaira draws from Surat the greater part of its supply of molasses, no steps seem to have been taken to improve the local cultivation and manufacture of sugar.\n\nSpices.\n\nOf spices, Cumin, *jiru*, Cuminum cyminum, with in 1876-77, 1423 acres, is the chief variety grown in the district.\n\nSilk.\n\nIn 1837, under Dr. Burn, the Civil Surgeon, a Government garden was established at Kaira. Besides in medicinal plants, such as senna and colocynth, experiments were made in the growth of mulberry trees and in the rearing of silk worms. To meet the charges of his experiments, Government sanctioned a sum of \u00a340 (Rs. 400) and a monthly allowance that rose from \u00a34 to \u00a38 (Rs. 40-80). The mulberry trees grew well. In 1838 in the Government plantation on the banks of the Shedhi, near the Kaira bridge, were '800 trees of the St. Helena species all thriving uncommonly well.'\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The average outturn per acre is estimated at forty-nine pounds of the prepared dye worth \u00a37 8s. (Rs. 72), and seed worth 7s. (Rs. 3-8), \u00a37 15s. (Rs. 77-8) in all. The cost of production and manufacture, including 14s. (Rs. 7) of rent, is estimated at \u00a35 19s. (Rs. 59-8), being a profit of \u00a31 16s. (Rs. 18.)\n\n\\(^2\\) Of the whole area, 106 acres were in Nadiad, 11 in Kapadvanj, and 1 in Th\u00e1sra.\n\n\\(^3\\) Under the Opium Act (No. 1 of 1878) the cultivation of the poppy has been entirely prohibited. (See Rules published by the Government of Bombay on 30th March 1878.)\n\n\\(^4\\) The outturn of twelve pounds per acre is, including the value of the seed, estimated at \u00a37 (Rs. 70); the cost of cultivation, including 10s. (Rs. 5) of rent, at \u00a33 14s. (Rs. 37); and the peasant's profit at \u00a33 6s. (Rs. 33).\nThey stood in rows about twelve feet apart with straight stems three to four feet high. They were manured with dry cowdung, and in the hot season watered two or three times a week. In 1840 Dr. Burn reported his plantation flourishing. It had fed 60,000 worms and some silk had been reeled. On account of this success allowances of 30s. (Rs. 15) a month each were granted to three Gujarati youths to go and learn reeling under Signor Mutti, then employed by Government in the Deccan in silk culture. The Kaira experiments were continued for some years. In 1844 Dr. Thatcher, then in charge of the garden, reported that the mulberry trees, when small, suffered from the hot wind. In other respects they did well, growing both in hedges and as trees from nine to ten feet high. They wanted water at least once every twenty days. The worms were less successful. In ordinary seasons, during the greater part of the year they kept fairly healthy. But in 1843, a year of great heat, almost all died. Silk was made and forwarded to the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, who reported the samples of very good quality, equal to Canton No. 2, and worth 10s. a pound (Rs. 10 the paka ser). But the people of the district, chiefly, it was said, from their dislike to destroy the worms took no interest in the industry, and the garden was finally closed in 1847.\n\nAnother Government attempt to improve cultivation was in 1843 the introduction of the American plough. Two were given on trial to cultivators. The result was disappointing. The men complained that the ploughs were clumsy, that the furrows were too wide, and that the work of levelling was much heavier than after ordinary ploughing. Besides they were too elaborate, costing more to mend than the Kaira plough to make. The Collector, Mr. Kirkland, was of opinion that their successful working implied both in artisans and ploughmen more skill than was to be found in Kaira.\n\nIn 1875 another attempt was made to introduce a better class of plough, this time of English make. Three ploughs were tried, one in Nadiad, one in Kaira, and one in Borsad. On the whole they gave satisfaction. The faults found were that the share was too long and made the work too heavy for one pair of bullocks, and that as the plough could not be guided with one hand to plough and drive, the bullocks required two men instead of one. The Collector, Mr. Sheppard, was of opinion that if the handles could be joined by a cross-piece the ploughs would become popular. In December 1878 Mr. Robertson, the superintendent of the Madras Government Farm, visited Nadiad. He thought that the soil, among the best he had ever seen, was suffering from too shallow ploughing. Some ploughs were accordingly ordered from the Madras Government Farm and a skilled cultivator sent there to learn their use. Three lads belonging to large landowning patidar families have also gone to Madras to be taught scientific farming under Mr. Robertson.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 180 of 1847, 39-98.\n2 Collector to Government, 308, 23rd December 1844.\n3 Collector 2445, 6th December 1875.\n4 Kaira Agricultural Record (1879) published under the Collector's presidency by a committee of Nadiad landowners.\nIn the rural parts of the district not only the strictly agricultural classes, Kanbis, Kolis, and Musalm\u00e1ns, but the whole population including Br\u00e1hmans are engaged in cultivation. Only in large towns is there a regular class of artisans, washermen, tailors, blacksmiths, and others entirely supported by their callings, and even in towns many artisans are forced to eke out their gains by cultivation. Dheds and other weavers, though engaged at their looms in the fair season, during the rains devote their time to raising grain for the support of their families. The V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s are, perhaps, the only class not directly engaged in the work of cultivation. By far the greater part of the land is tilled by Kanbis, chiefly of the Leva tribe, the most skilful and thrifty cultivators in Gujar\u00e1t. Except the talabda or local Kolis nearly if not quite as good as Kanbis, Kolis as a class are bad and thriftless cultivators. Rajputs and Musalm\u00e1ns hold a very small proportion of the land. The Rajputs are careless, unskilful, and addicted to the use of opium. The Musalm\u00e1ns want energy and perseverance, and labour under the special disadvantage that their women do not help in the field.\n\nThe years between 1738 and 1746 and the season of 1751 are referred to as times of distress when village communities were broken and villages deserted.\u00b9 The severest famine, of which details are available, was in 1790-91. Throughout the year rain fell only once. The people were forced to migrate to M\u00e1lwa, and there attacked by a pestilence died in great numbers. The G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, except that he took a fourth share of the grass, is said to have remitted the whole revenue demand, and to have taken steps for the suppression of crime. During the scarcity, twelve and a half pounds of millet, sixteen of wheat, twenty-four of unhulled rice, and twenty of pulse, sold for two shillings. The next season of scarcity was 1813-14. Throughout the year there were only two falls of rain, one in July, the other about the middle of September. The local scarcity, itself very serious, was increased by the influx of starving people from K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. Especially among these immigrants many deaths are said to have occurred. Food grains would seem in several cases to have been dearer than in 1790. The prices were, for two shillings, seventeen pounds of millet, seventeen and a quarter of Indian millet, ten of wheat, twenty of unhulled rice, and twenty-two and a half of pulse. 1824 was a year of distress, and in 1825 the later rains almost entirely failed. Much suffering was caused, and remissions of land revenue to the amount of \u00a316,198 (Rs. 1,61,980) were granted. In 1834 locusts ate up the crops, a great scarcity arose, and many cattle were lost. Remissions amounting to \u00a319,655 (Rs. 1,96,550) of land revenue were granted. In 1835 the rain was too heavy and the cold weather crops were spoiled by frost. The last forty-two years (1836-1877), though the rainfall has at times been scanty and the crops have partly failed, have passed without any season of famine or even of general scarcity.\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 78, 515.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCAPITAL.\n\nAccording to the 1872 census returns, there were in that year, besides well-to-do cultivators and professional men, 6885 persons in positions implying the possession of capital. Of these 2072 were bankers, money-changers, and shop-keepers; 3343 were merchants and traders; and 1470 were supported by incomes derived from funded property, shares, annuities, and the like. In 1869-70, under the income tax returns, 3742 persons paid on yearly incomes of from \u00a350 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 500-1000); 414 persons on incomes of from \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 1000-2000); 144 persons on incomes of from \u00a3200 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 2000-10,000); and five on incomes of from \u00a31000 to \u00a310,000 (Rs. 10,000-1,00,000).\n\nSpending freely on their chief family festivities, the higher class of Hindus practise in every-day life the extreme thrift, living more cheaply and saving more steadily than the corresponding classes in Surat and Broach. Besides in hoarding either ornaments or coin, savings are invested in Government securities, in shares, in land, in houses, in trade, and in money-lending. Almost all in a position to save, invest part of their store in ornaments, plain solid bands of silver and gold with little or no outlay on the work. The practice of buying Government securities, and of putting money in savings banks, has during the last ten years spread considerably. The interest on Government securities has risen from \u00a351 (Rs. 510) in 1865 to \u00a3255 (Rs. 2550) in 1877, and the deposits from \u00a31612 (Rs. 16,120) to \u00a313,021 (Rs. 1,30,210). Still in this respect Kaira is far behind Surat, where in 1877, the deposits amounted to \u00a384,043 (Rs. 8,40,430) and the payment of interest on Government securities to the considerable sum of \u00a38644 (Rs. 86,440). The purchase of shares seems to find little favour with the Kaira monied classes. Hardly any of the district merchants are believed to have invested money in the Bombay, Surat, or Ahmedabad factories, and even the Nadiad spinning company had no local shareholders. From the summary of the registration returns for 1867 and for 1874, it appears that though in the greater number of cases the purchasers of land are either cultivators or money-lenders, in both years in about one-fifth of the transfers, the buyers follow almost every calling, traders, craftsmen of all classes, servants, and beggars. Over most of the district the people take a pride in their houses and spend money in improving them. But, except town money-lenders, many of whom buy their debtors' dwellings, they do not invest their savings in house property. Besides bankers, merchants, and shop-keepers, well-to-do\ncultivators and pleaders invest their savings in trade. But it is in money-lending that the well-to-do in Kaira lay out almost all their capital.\n\nKaira money-lenders are of two classes, professional and non-professional. Among professional money-lenders, there is a marked difference between the banker or n\u00e1n\u00e1vati,\\(^1\\) who, with a capital of \u00a310,000 and upwards, negotiates bills of exchange, makes advances to persons of credit, and engages in large mercantile transactions, and the usurer or tuni\u00e1t, who, doling out from a scanty store often borrowed from one of the larger money-lenders, preys on the needs of the poorest class of townsmen or the careless and unthrifty villager. Between these extremes the great body of professional money-lenders hold an ill-defined position. The banker, from smallness of capital, unsuccessful speculation, or changes in the course of trade, forced into petty dealings with low-class borrowers, has to resort to many of the usurer's practices; while the usurer, whose wealth enables him to enter into large dealings, gains by degrees a place among the district bankers.\n\nBankers live almost entirely in towns. They trade, negotiate bills of exchange, take deposits, and make advances. The banker's trade ventures are all wholesale; he lays in a store of grain to be re-sold to small dealers; he speculates in cotton, or he imports cloth from Bombay for local shop-keepers and retail traders. In his trading operations the Kaira banker is careful, risking in speculative investments only a small portion of his capital. The bills of exchange commonly negotiated are of eight kinds\u2014payable at sight, taratni hundi; payable on the following day, dinvalt\u00e1m\u00ed hundi; payable on the fourth day, bhomni hundi; payable on the eighth day, ch\u00e1rdd\u00e1h\u00e1d\u00e1n\u00ed hundi; payable on the eleventh day, agiy\u00e1rm\u00ed hundi; payable on the twenty-first day, ekvisni hundi; payable on the forty-fifth day, pist\u00e1lisni hundi; and payable on the sixty-first day, eksetni hundi. Bills for the longest periods are generally drawn in the course of the Central Indian trade in opium and tobacco; those for twenty-one days, in connection with the trade to Kadi and P\u00e1tan in northern Gujar\u00e1t, and those of eleven days sight on Bombay. As the stamp duty is higher on bills not payable at sight, the practice of granting bills payable at sight is said to be on the increase. The holder of a bill payable after a certain interval, may receive the money on presentation before the lapse of the period fixed. In such cases a monthly discount of from a half to one per cent is allowed. The money left in the hands of bankers chiefly belongs to Government servants, and childless old men and widows. Deposits of the latter class, varying in amount from \u00a350 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 500-2000) are, for the most part, the proceeds of the sale or mortgage of property set aside by the owners to meet their funeral expenses. On such sums a small yearly interest of three or four per cent is paid. In advancing money high class bankers deal only with persons of credit, petty traders, retail shop-keepers, cultivators\n\n\\(^1\\) N\u00e1n\u00e1vati literally means money-changer. The tuni\u00e1t is also called kh\u00e1ndh\u00e1-p\u00e1njra-valo, or man of instalments.\nof substance, and usurers, who borrow to re-lend at higher rates of interest. Bankers who refuse to advance money except to persons of credit, beyond filing a suit in the civil court, seldom take any special steps for the recovery of their claims. Those, on the other hand, whose clients belong to the poorer class of borrowers, are forced to practise the usurer's elaborate system of dunning. The people are said generally to deal with one capitalist. But among the poorer class of cultivators, more than one creditor has frequently claims upon the same debtor. The crop of a poor cultivator is often the only property available for liquidating a debt. And so, in the harvest season, the money-lender is forced to pass some days in his debtor's fields, examining the crop and seeing that none of the produce is made away or handed over to a more favoured creditor. If a banker has several sons, the sons help their father as clerks and in collecting his debts. They are said seldom to take to any other calling, or to leave their native town to push business in distant places.\n\nThe account books kept by a high class money-lender are the hand book, h\u00e1th-wahi, a rough memorandum book; the cash book, rojmel; the ledger, khat\u00f3wahi; the monthly account book, \u00e1varo; the interest book, viy\u00e1jwahi; and the bill book, hundini nondh. As a rule, the village shop-keeper keeps a cash book, rojmel, and an account current book, th\u00e1mkh\u00e1ta. The latter is often carelessly prepared, containing entries of transactions extending over years and of dealings with several distinct persons. Some village shopkeepers are said to keep no record of their transactions except bonds and promissory notes.\n\nMost usurers are men of small capital varying from \u00a3200 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 2000-10,000). But among them are some rich men with property, including claims of not less than \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). Unlike the banker, the usurer confines himself to making money advances, never negotiating bills of exchange or engaging in trade. Though, as a rule, he lives in a town, the usurer, especially during the harvest season, spends much of his time in the villages gathering in his debts. The son of a usurer generally succeeds to his father's business, though by enlarging his dealings and adding to his capital he may hope to rise to the position of a banker. In Kaira both bankers and usurers advance money on the security of gold and silver ornaments. There is, therefore, no room for the special class of pawn-brokers, jans\u00e1u s\u00e1huk\u00e1rs, found in Surat.\n\nAmong non-professional money-lenders are traders and shopkeepers, rich cultivators, pleaders, Government servants, well-to-do artisans, and religious beggars, chiefly Gosais of whom one is said to be worth about \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000). Of the trading and shopkeeping money-lenders, the chief are cloth-sellers, grain-sellers, and grocers. In some of the larger towns are shop-keepers whose business makes them independent of money-lending. But, as a rule, especially in village shops, dealings in grain or cloth are useful, chiefly as a means of drawing the poorer class of villagers to borrow money. A poor village shop-keeper, his capital laid out in advances, passes his time in dunning his debtors. If rich, leaving his shop in\ncharge of a clerk, he buys a town house, seldom visiting the village except during the rainy months when the poor press for grain advances, and at harvest time when he recovers his outstanding debts. The son of a village shop-keeper generally succeeds his father, and in many villages the shop has for generations been in the hands of the same family. If there are several sons and the family is poor, the younger brothers sometimes try to start business in a fresh village. Next to the shop-keeper, the most important of non-professional money-lenders is the rich cultivator or p\u0101tid\u0101r, who lends money and grain to the poorer villagers. The number of Government servants, pleaders, and well-to-do artisans, who lend money is small, and they generally deal only with a few men, and those of good credit.\n\nBorrowers are of four classes, landed gentry, small traders, artisans, and cultivators. Among landed gentry, the Musalm\u0101ns, Kolis and Rajputs are in their ways so careless and unthrifty, that many of them have allowed themselves to sink deep in debt. So unsatisfactory had their condition become, that in 1877 Government passed an Act (XIV. of 1877) for the settlement of the claims against them. In most parts of the district the artisans are, on the whole, better off than either the small traders or the mass of the cultivators. Unlike the trader, the artisan need keep no large stock of goods, while, compared with the cultivator, as he is generally a member of a much smaller community he spends little on caste feasts. Cultivators form the largest and most important class of borrowers, seeking loans either to pay the Government rent or to meet special family expenses. At the time of the introduction of British rule and for more than thirty years after, the whole land revenue of the district was generally collected from bankers or money-lenders, who recovered what they could from the cultivators.\u00b9 In 1840 so widely was this system spread, that the Collector reported, that of a total revenue of \u00a3146,371 (Rs. 14,63,710), only \u00a338,091 (Rs. 3,80,910) or 26\u00b72 per cent, were received direct from the cultivators. Up to the year 1856 little improvement would seem to have taken place. At that time\u00b2 it was said to be a matter of notoriety, that, speaking generally, all the cultivators and holders of land in Gujarat were in debt to such an extent that they had no means of extricating themselves from their difficulties. A few years later (1857-1864) the very high price of field produce and labour freed from debt almost the whole agricultural population. But the decline of prices that set in about 1870 crippled a large number of the careless and improvident. In 1874 the state of the district was said to be far from satisfactory; the money-lenders, tired of waiting for more favourable times, had ceased to give credit and crowded the civil courts.\u00b3 Since then the high produce prices of the last two years have done much to improve the cultivators\u2019 credit.\n\nIn 1827 interest was limited by law to a yearly rate of twelve per\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Diggle\u2019s report of 1806, and the Collector\u2019s report 309, 23rd December 1844. The practice was for each headman to give a note for his village. These notes were convertible in July at Ahmedabad and Baroda, and had to be negotiated by agents specially chosen by Government.

This provision was easily evaded, and in 1840, creditors would seem to have been in a position, by making deductions, mand\u00e1mi, from the amount actually advanced, to recover from the most needy of their debtors from one to six per cent additional profit. In 1856, according to Mr. Forbes, monthly interest was stipulated for at two per cent, or if the terms were unusually moderate, at one. At present (1877), according to the returns received, in small transactions when an article is given in pawn, artisans and well-to-do cultivators pay interest at yearly rates varying from six to nine per cent; the charge in the case of the poorer cultivators rising to twelve per cent. In such transactions, if personal security only is given, the corresponding yearly rates are said to vary from nine to twelve per cent for the richer, rising as high as twenty per cent for the poorer class of borrowers. In large transactions, well-to-do cultivators who give jewels as security, pay yearly rates of from three to four and a half per cent. When cattle or other moveable property is pledged by the poorer cultivators yearly interest is charged at from nine to eighteen per cent. When land is mortgaged the yearly rates are reported to vary from six to eighteen per cent. Except in Umreth and Borsad, where interest on personal security is unusually high, there would seem to be but little variety in the rates charged in different parts of the district. These are the nominal rates of interest. But in almost all cases, especially when the borrower is poor, by levying a premium or mand\u00e1mi, the lender adds from one to six per cent to his profits. Six per cent per annum is said to be generally considered a fair return for money invested in buying land, the estimates varying from four and a half per cent in Mehmadabad to seven and a half per cent in Umreth. Besides what they make by interest and premiums, money-lenders are said to add to their gains by irregular and unfair means. Serious and wilful fraud is rare. But the cultivator's ignorance and apathy give the money-lender much opportunity for sharp practice.\n\nExcept occasionally for seed, only Musalm\u00e1ns, Kolis, and other unthrifty and unskilled cultivators borrow grain. The advance is generally made in the beginning of the rains and repaid after six months at harvest time. For this the ordinary charge is one-quarter in addition to the quantity received. The payment is almost always in kind. If in money, from twenty-five to thirty-six per cent interest is generally recovered. But higher rates, half as much again, or even twice the original amount are said sometimes to be charged.\n\nIn 1806, so scanty was the stock of money, that it was usual for weavers and cultivators to barter their wares. At the same time there were in circulation no fewer than six varieties of coin, the Surat rupee, the Sicca rupee, the Baroda rupee, the As\u00e1sai rupee at par with the Baroda, the Cambay rupee, and a rupee coined in Kaira and known by the name of jina or the small rupee. At present (1877), except in the case of payments of the land assessment, the British currency is\n\n---\n\n1 Regulation V. of 1827, chap. III.  \n2 Collector, 819, 8th October 1840.  \n3 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, II., 250.\nnot in general use. The medium in ordinary dealings is the Baroda or b\u0101b\u0101sh\u0101\u012b rupee, varying in value, but generally about fourteen per cent below the standard. These variations in value, the money-lender in his dealings with the poorer class of borrowers, generally turns to his own advantage.\n\nAmong the bankers and traders of the Kaira district cases of bankruptcy are rare. Failure to meet trade engagements is considered disgraceful, and is said to be visited with social penalties but little less stringent than those enforced in the case of a breach of caste rules. The religious feeling that connects a man's condition in the next world with the discharge of all claims against him at the time of his death, is strong in this district, and the duty of paying an ancestral debt is said to be evaded only in cases of extreme helplessness or hopeless poverty. In small cities and towns, the amount of property owned by a banker or merchant and the extent of his trade liabilities are pretty well known, and it is comparatively easy to decide how far in any case failure is due to fraud or carelessness, and how far to bad fortune. When a trader finds that he cannot meet his liabilities, he calls his creditors, shows them how things stand, and leaves himself in their hands. After inquiry, the creditors, in proportion to their claims, divide the assets. When such a partition has been made, no further steps are ordinarily taken. Unless he has been shown to have acted unfairly, the discharged bankrupt will probably find little difficulty in raising money enough to help him to make a fresh start. Among shop-keepers, except the risk of fire, flood, or robbers, there is little chance of any very heavy loss, and bankruptcy is almost unknown.\n\nMortgages are of two kinds, s\u0101n, when the land is pledged as security but the mortgagor remains in possession, and giro, when the mortgagee takes possession of the land instead of interest. According to the registration returns, mortgages in excess of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) have fallen from 3035, of the value of \u00a3124,396 (Rs. 12,48,960) in 1869-70, to 1707, of the value of \u00a364,158 (Rs. 6,41,580) in 1876-77.\n\nUnder Mar\u0101tha rule bricklayers, carpenters, blacksmiths, and day-labourers were forced to work for the men in power receiving some grain at harvest, but seldom any money payment. Fifty years ago (1828) a town labourer earned 3d. (2 annas) a day, and a carpenter 6d. (4 annas). In 1844 a town labourer earned the same wage as in 1828; a field labourer was, as formerly, paid in kind from three to five pounds of millet, b\u0101jri, a day; a bricklayer earned from 6d. to 9d. (4-6 annas); and a carpenter from 9d. to 1s. (6-8 annas). Between 1858 and 1864, when the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway line was under construction, and house-building was carried on to a large extent over the whole district, the demand for labour increased and the rates rose by about one-half. At present\n\n---\n\n1 The details are, in 1869-70, 3035, value \u00a3124,396; in 1870-71, 2716, value \u00a3109,201; in 1871-72, 2626, value \u00a395,576; in 1872-73, 2507, value \u00a399,905; in 1873-74, 2453, value \u00a3104,637; in 1874-75, 1789, value \u00a373,785; in 1875-76, 1685, value \u00a372,906; in 1876-77, 1707, value \u00a364,158.\n\n2 Mr. Kirkland, 308, 23rd December 1844.\nKAIRA.\n\n(1878) a labourer's daily wage varies from 3d. to 6d. (2-4 annas) according to the urgency of the work. Besides his ordinary wage of from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. (2-3 annas), which is paid in money, a field labourer gets two or three millet cakes at midday. Except in the rains, when labour is wanted for weeding and transplanting, the supply of labour from among Kolis, Kachhuis, poor Kanbis, Vaghris and Dheds, is in excess of the demand. Town labourers, except for an hour's rest at midday, work from eight or nine in the morning to five or six in the evening; field labourers go to work about six in the morning and remain till about six in the evening, taking at midday an hour's rest. Thirty years ago a labourer had almost no credit; now he would, without security, be trusted with an advance of from \u00a31 10s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 15-20). Except the Lund\u00e1s or hereditary servants in the households of well-to-do Rajputs, who like the Surat H\u00e1lis are fed and clothed by their masters, there are no hereditary labourers in the district. In a few sub-divisions the practice of mortgaging labour prevails. The mortgagors, generally poor field labourers, for money advances of from \u00a32 to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 20-25), pledge their labour for terms rising to one year. During their time of service they are fed and clothed and well treated by their masters. Carpenter's and bricklayer's wages vary in the different seasons, the demand being strongest in the hot months, when the cultivators repair and build houses. At present a bricklayer's daily wage varies from 6d. to 9d. (4-6 annas); and a carpenter's from 1s. to 1s. 3d. (8-10 annas). They go to work at about nine in the morning and return before sunset. One-third of an ordinary day's wage is paid for extra work done in the morning from six to nine. In villages, besides two pounds of millet, bajri, and a quarter of a pound of clarified butter, ghi, a day, a carpenter's monthly wage is \u00a31 2s. (Rs. 11), and a bricklayer's 12s. (Rs. 6). For miscellaneous work, such as repairing field tools, village artisans are every year, at harvest time, paid in grain.\n\nA statement of produce prices, reaching back as far as 1790, is given below. For the first thirty-four years the figures refer only to one portion of the district, the M\u00e1tar sub-division. Since 1824 they are supposed to represent average prices over the whole district. Taking the staple grain, millet or bajri, the average rupee price during the whole period of eighty-eight years is fifty-one pounds, or excluding seven years of abnormally high and five years of abnormally low prices, an average of fifty pounds. The seven years of highest prices were fifteen pounds in 1812 and 1864; seventeen pounds in 1877; eighteen pounds in 1790; nineteen pounds in 1863; and twenty pounds in 1813 and 1869. The years 1863, 1864, and 1869, when the high value of millet was due to the cheapness of money rather than the want of grain, were the times of greatest agricultural prosperity. 1790, 1812, 1813, and 1877 were years of famine or scarcity. The cheap years, of which there have been five, eighty-two pounds in 1856, eighty-four in 1855, eighty-five in 1848, 100 in 1831, and 120 in 1832, have been times of complaint and agricultural distress. Excluding the years of special scarcity, the whole series may be roughly divided into eight periods. From 1791 to 1799, a time of cheap grain, with an average price of sixty-nine pounds; from\nChapter V.\n\n1800 to 1811, a time of moderate and most steady prices scarcely varying from fifty-five pounds; then, after the scarcity in 1812 and 1813, five years (1814-1818) of moderate prices varying from forty-six to sixty-five and averaging fifty-nine pounds. Again, after the scarcity in 1819, follow seven dear years (1820-1826), prices varying from thirty-eight to forty-five and averaging forty-one pounds. Next, for six years (1827-1832), a rapid fall in prices ranging from fifty-eight in 1827 to 120 in 1832 and averaging eighty-two pounds. Then ten dear and changeable years (1833 to 1842), prices varying from thirty to sixty and averaging forty-six pounds. Then sixteen years (1843-1858) of low prices varying from fifty-two to eighty-five and averaging sixty-six pounds; and lastly, eighteen years (1859-1876) of high prices varying from fifteen to fifty-two and averaging thirty pounds.\n\nKaira produce prices, 1790-1877.\n\n| Produce | Scarcity | First Period (1791-1799.) | Second Period (1800-1811.) |\n|---------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|         |          | 1790. | 1791. | 1792. | 1793. | 1794. | 1795. | 1796. | 1797. | 1798. | 1799. | 1800. | 1801. | 1802. | 1803. | 1804. | 1805. |\n| Millet  |          | 18    | 36    | 50    | 59    | 62    | 66    | 83    | 90    | 79    | 70    | 55    | 55    | 54    | 54    | 55    | 56    |\n| Indian do... |      | 22    | 46    | 64    | 73    | 80    | 90    | 90    | 80    | 80    | 74    | 75    | 75    | 80    | 80    | 75    |\n| Wheat   |          | 16    | 32    | 45    | 51    | 46    | 60    | 85    | 80    | 70    | 60    | 55    | 55    | 65    | 66    | 54    | 58    |\n| Rice    |          | 22    | 40    | 50    | 60    | 62    | 62    | 85    | 69    | 69    | 69    | 65    | 65    | 65    | 69    | 65    | 65    |\n| Pulse   |          | 19    | 36    | 46    | 54    | 55    | 58    | 60    | 65    | 65    | 65    | 60    | 58    | 60    | 60    | 61    | 60    |\n\n| Produce | Scarcity | Second Period (1800-1811.) \u2014continued. | Third Period (1814-1818.) | Fourth Period (1820-1826.) |\n|---------|----------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|         |          | 1806. | 1807. | 1808. | 1809. | 1810. | 1811. | 1812. | 1813. | 1814. | 1815. | 1816. | 1817. | 1818. | 1819. | 1820. | 1821. | 1822. | 1823. |\n| Millet  |          | 58    | 55    | 54    | 53    | 55    | 60    | 15    | 20    | 46    | 62    | 64    | 58    | 65    | 30    | 40    | 40    | 43    | 58    |\n| Indian do... |      | 75    | 80    | 75    | 80    | 75    | 70    | 22    | 27    | 55    | 81    | 76    | 72    | 72    | 38    | 55    | 59    | 62    | 60    |\n| Wheat   |          | 57    | 54    | 55    | 55    | 55    | 50    | 14    | 20    | 43    | 35    | 41    | 54    | 57    | 27    | 38    | 40    | 49    | 45    |\n| Rice    |          | 69    | 85    | 89    | 89    | 65    | 65    | 60    | 32    | 28    | 45    | 61    | 66    | 81    | 68    | 47    | 52    | 51    | 85    | 80    |\n| Pulse   |          | 60    | 58    | 57    | 55    | 60    | 60    | 14    | 21    | 49    | 49    | 51    | 51    | 51    | 56    | 60    | 62    | 62    | 64    |\n\n| Produce | Scarcity | Fifth Period (1827-1832.) | Sixth Period (1833-1843.) |\n|---------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|         |          | 1824. | 1825. | 1826. | 1827. | 1828. | 1829. | 1830. | 1831. | 1832. | 1833. | 1834. | 1835. | 1836. | 1837. | 1838. | 1839. | 1840. | 1841. | 1842. |\n| Millet  |          | 38    | 40    | 45    | 58    | 65    | 81    | 70    | 100   | 120   | 80    | 30    | 35    | 46    | 50    | 47    | 36    | 52    | 52    | 57    |\n| Indian do... |      | 60    | 58    | 70    | 80    | 56    | 80    | 130   | 160   | 80    | 35    | 65    | 60    | 75    | 70    | 55    | 55    | 60    | 71    |\n| Wheat   |          | 80    | 50    | 37    | 55    | 57    | 65    | 75    | 75    | 85    | 73    | 27    | 47    | 48    | 55    | 50    | 38    | 35    | 52    | 65    |\n| Rice    |          | 50    | 50    | 46    | 48    | 48    | 44    | 42    | 42    | 42    | 40    | 40    | 40    | 40    | 40    | 40    | 38    | 38    | 38    | 40    |\n| Pulse   |          | 42    | 40    | 40    | 40    | 50    | 55    | 63    | 50    | 78    | 50    | 18    | 20    | 56    | 60    | 45    | 54    | 52    | 45    | 55    |\n| Tobacco |          | 27    | 27    | 27    | 27    | 32    | 32    | 30    | 27    | 27    | 30    | 27    | 27    | 27    | 27    | 27    | 27    | 27    | 27    | 27    |\nAlmost all articles are sold by weight. Except for milk and clarified butter, no measures of capacity are used. The weights are of two sorts: one for gold, silver, and drugs; the other for grain, vegetables, and the cheaper metals, copper, brass, iron, lead, and zinc. The former, square in shape are by village goldsmiths, made of lead and sometimes of an alloy of brass and copper; the latter are made of iron by blacksmiths. Both are, under the Weights and Measures Act (Act X. of 1872), yearly inspected and stamped by the police. Gold, silver, and drugs are weighed according to the following scale: six chokh\u00e1s, grains of rice, one rati; three ratis, one v\u00e1l; sixteen v\u00e1l\u00e1s, one gadi\u00e1no; two gadi\u00e1n\u00e1s, one tolo. Again, eight ratis make one m\u00e1so; and twelve m\u00e1s\u00e1s, one tolo. For metals other than gold and silver, and grain of all sorts, the following table is current: two and half rupees, one adhol; two adhols, one navt\u00e1k; two navt\u00e1ks, one p\u00e1s\u00e9r; two p\u00e1sers, one achher; two achhers, one ser; forty sers, one man; sixteen mans, one kalsi; two kalsis, one bediyu. In the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, the following table is also in use: twelve mans, one mani; 100 manis, one man\u00e1sa; 100 man\u00e1s\u00e1s, one kan\u00e1sa. As the ser in use is equal to forty tol\u00e1s each of 180 Troy grains, the weight of a man is equal to 41\u00bd English pounds avoirdupois.\n\nCloth is measured either by the gaj or the h\u00e1th. The gaj, made of iron, brass, or wood, is of two kinds, the tailor's gaj 27\u00bd inches, and the ordinary gaj two feet long. Both are divided into twenty-four equal parts called tasus. The ordinary gaj is used in measuring cotton and silk goods. Turbans, waistcloths, dhoti\u00e1s, women\u2019s robes, s\u00e1dis, and such other articles as are sold in pairs or singly, but never in parts, are not measured by the gaj, but by the h\u00e1th. A\nh\u00e1th, the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger of a tall man, varies from seventeen to nineteen and half inches. It is the measure commonly used by the poorer classes. The h\u00e1th table is twelve anglis, finger breadths, one vehet; and two vehets, one h\u00e1th. The gaj and the English yard, the latter generally used by cloth merchants, are inspected and stamped by the police.\n\nIn measuring land, since the introduction of the revenue survey, an acre of 43,560 square feet has been substituted for the bigha. The acre is divided into forty gunth\u00e1s, and the gunth\u00e1 into sixteen \u00e1nn\u00e1s. The bigha, equal to \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\)th part of an acre,\\(^1\\) was formerly the unit of land measure, and is still generally understood by the people. It was divided into twenty vas\u00e1s, and the vasa into twenty visv\u00e1sis. A visv\u00e1si, also called a k\u00e1thi, equalling five h\u00e1ths of from 18-33 to 19-67 inches each, has a mean length of about ninety-six inches. Building sites are measured by the gaj, and land used for agricultural purposes, by a chain thirty-three feet in length.\n\nStones are sold by a superficial gaj of twenty-four inches, and not by a cubic gaj. The price per gaj varies according to the nature of the work.\n\nIn the case of timber, a gaj of twenty-seven inches is used. This gaj is divided into twenty equal parts called vas\u00e1s, and each vasa into twenty equal parts called visv\u00e1sis. A piece of timber is measured lengthwise. As it is seldom of uniform thickness, the circumference at the middle of the length is taken. This measure is divided by four, and the quotient is squared. The result thus obtained is multiplied by the length measure and the product divided by 400. This last quotient gives the cubic contents in gaj; the remainder in connection with this quotient, when multiplied by twenty and divided by 400, gives the measure in vas\u00e1s; and the remainder in this last case, multiplied by twenty and divided by 400, gives the measure in visv\u00e1sis. Thus the required measure is determined in gaj, vasa, and visv\u00e1sis, and the sale price is fixed at so much per gaj. The unit of measurement used in earth work and mud walls is the h\u00e1th.\n\nMilk, and sometimes clarified butter, are the only articles sold by capacity measures. The capacity measures used are brass cups called \u00e1phkhora. The contents of a one ser \u00e1phkhora are equal to 25-52 cubic inches. Clarified butter as a rule sold by weight, is among the poorer classes weighed in special capacity measures made by the wandering tribe of Thoris.\n\nBricks, tiles, bamboos, rafters, poles, fruit, and betel leaves are sold by the number. Bricks and tiles are sold by the thousand, which, from the practice of putting aside one brick or tile to mark each hundred, actually numbers 1010. Rafters and cocoanuts are sold by the score, the score of rafters containing twenty-two.\n\nGrass is sold by the thousand, and millet straw, kadbi, by the hundred bundles. In Kaira, a hundred bundles of kadbi mean 105, one being added for each twenty bundles. In the case of grass, 147\n\n\\(^1\\) Two Kaira bighas are equal to one acre and seven gunth\u00e1s.\nbundles are given for every hundred. This is called a full or *paka* hundred, compared with the small or *kacha* hundred of 105 only. A *man* generally contains forty *sers*. Sometimes, though the practice is growing rare, in wholesale purchases grocers allow from two to five *sers* extra. In the case of molasses, *gol*, and sugar, from two to eight *sers* are allowed for the weight of the coverings.\n\nAs there are no regular shops for selling pearls and precious stones, the weights are but little understood. All purchases are made at Ahmedabad, Baroda, Surat, or Bombay.\n\nThe table for measuring time is sixty *vipals* or winks, one *pal*; sixty *pals*, one *ghadi* of twenty-four minutes; $2\\frac{1}{4}$ *ghadis*, one *hora*; $3\\frac{1}{4}$ *ghadis*, one *choghdi*; $7\\frac{1}{2}$ *ghadis*, one *pohor*; four *pohors*, one *divas*; seven *divas*, one *athav\u00e1diya*; two *athav\u00e1diy\u00e1s*, one *paksh*; two *paksh*, one month; twelve months, one year. In former times the Hindus had neither watches nor sun-dials. Their time measure was the water clock, and this, though in ordinary life never referred to, is still used at marriage and thread ceremonies. Besides by the water clock time was calculated by the length of shadows. One plan was, in an open sunlit spot, to measure in feet the length of one's shadow; to add six to the number and divide 121 by the sum. The quotient gives the time in *ghadis* of twenty-four minutes, after sunrise, if the sun has not crossed the meridian, and before sunset, if the sun has crossed the meridian. Another plan is to hold upright a thin rod eighteen *\u00e4nglis* long, bend it so that its shadow will touch the other end of the rod on the ground, and measure in *\u00e4nglis* the perpendicular height of the rod. This, like the other plan, shows the number of *ghadis* either after sunrise or before sunset.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTRADE.\n\nIn 1844, except from the south gate of Kaira town to the wooden bridge on the Shedhi river near Ratanpur village, a distance of about a mile, there were no made roads of any kind. The district highways and crossways were principally formed from cart tracks, and though in some places uneven and narrow, they were on the whole pretty good. The sandiness of the soil made them somewhat heavy for carts, and in the rainy season they were partially flooded. But a few days of fair weather again made them passable. The paths between villages were worse. Exceedingly narrow, they were in some places so overhung with bushes and branches as to make it difficult for carts and horsemen to pass.\\(^1\\)\n\nUntil 1863 little was done to improve the state of the roads. In that year the survey superintendent spoke of the roads as ordinary cart tracks execrable in the black soil, and in the light, though on the whole tolerable, in places as bad as roads could be, running through a deep sandy soil trying to man and beast and destructive to wheeled vehicles of any kind. In 1863 the local fund cess was first levied, and since then steady progress has been made in clearing and metalling roads.\n\nThere are at present (1878) six main lines of road extending with their branches over a total distance of 100 miles. Of these fifty-one have been and twenty-one are (1878) being metalled with stone or nodular limestone. Except a few large rivers, watercourses are bridged throughout. Of the two parts into which the Bombay and Baroda Railway divides the district, that to the north-east, the larger of the two, contains two principal roads. These from Kapadvanj in the north, start southwards, one running a little to the west to meet the railway at Nadiad, and the other a little to the east to reach the Pali railway at Dakor. The Nadiad feeder, twenty-seven miles long, is an embanked, bridged, and unmetalled line. Besides the ordinary local trade, a good deal of traffic is carried by this route in connection with the Samajji fair in the Mahi Kantha. The Dakor feeder, twenty miles long, is a stone metalled road. In the south-west of the district towards the south, a railway feeder, eleven miles long, connects Borsad with the Vasad station. This road, bridged and metalled with nodular limestone, is passable all the year round. To the west, a line of seven miles runs from the railway station at Mehmadabad to the district head-\n\n\\(^1\\) Collector 308, 23rd December 1844.\nquarter station at Kaira. This is a bridged, drained, and limestone metalled road. Beyond Kaira it is continued twelve miles southwest to the S\u00e1barmati, and is partially bridged and metalled. From M\u00e1tar start two roads, one six miles to Kaira on the north, and the other thirteen to the Nadi\u00e1d station on the east. These lines are at present being metalled.\n\nOf six buildings for the accommodation of district officers, one at Kaira and the other at L\u00e1li, on the country track between Kaira and Ahmedabad, are in the Mehmadabad sub-division; one at Nadi\u00e1d, about two miles from the Nadi\u00e1d railway station, in the Nadi\u00e1d sub-division; one at V\u00e1sad in the A'nand sub-division; one at Dehv\u00e1n in the Borsad sub-division; and one at Kapadvanj in the Kapadvanj sub-division. For the convenience of travellers, the district is provided with ten rest-houses or dharmsh\u00e1l\u00e1s built since 1869 from local funds at a total cost of \u00a36191 (Rs. 61,910). Of the ten rest-houses, one at Lasundra, near the D\u00e1kor and Kapadvanj road, is in the Kapadvanj sub-division; one at Th\u00e1sra, and the other at P\u00e1li, both on the D\u00e1kor and Godhra road, in the Th\u00e1sra sub-division; one at N\u00e1ika, one at Shikoldi, and a third at Mehla\u00edj, in the M\u00e1tar sub-division; one at Kanjj, and the other at Sam\u00e1dra on the Kaira and Ahmedabad country track, in the Mehmadabad sub-division; and one at A'nand near the A'nand railway station, and the other at V\u00e1sad near the V\u00e1sad railway station, in the A'nand sub-division. The rest-house at A'nand which for building purposes received in addition to the local funds grant a contribution from a Bombay merchant, Mr. Premchand R\u00e1ichand, has an upper room for Europeans and separate quarters for Hindus, P\u00e1rsis, and Musalm\u00e1ns. Those in the Th\u00e1sra sub-division, besides quarters for all ordinary travellers, have separate accommodation for Europeans. The remaining houses are fitted only for ordinary native travellers. Besides the above, almost every large village has a rest-house with room enough for about ten or twelve native travellers.\n\nBesides at many places during the rainy season and at times of flood, two ferries maintained from local funds ply across the Mahi. Of these one between R\u00e1laj of Borsad and K\u00e1vi of Jambusar in the Broach district is permanent, and the other between P\u00e1li of Th\u00e1sra and Gotra of the Godhra sub-division of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls works only during the rainy season. In the year 1876-77 these ferries were farmed for \u00a333 (Rs. 330). Of this amount \u00a315 (Rs. 150), on account of the ferry at P\u00e1li, were credited in equal proportions to the Kaira and Panch Mah\u00e1ls local funds.\n\nNear the town of Kaira between the cantonment and the church the river V\u00e1trak with banks about thirty feet high is crossed by a handsome wooden bridge 250 feet long supported by fourteen pairs of iron pillars coupled with a screw clamp.\n\nAbout\u00b9 a mile and a quarter south of the V\u00e1sad station the rail-\n\n\u00b9 Contributed by H. B. Hargrave, Esq., Resident Engineer, Bombay and Baroda Railway.\nway passes over the river Mahi. At the crossing the river banks are from eighty to ninety feet high and the river bed about 4000 feet broad. The bridge was opened for traffic on the 3rd September 1862. Originally it had twenty-seven spans of Warren's girders 62' 6\", each supported on three vertical columns of Mitchell's screw piles 2' 6\" outside diameter, the metal being 1\" thick. In addition to the above, two stout columns were attached one on the down side and one on the up side of each pier. For the reasons stated in the account of the Narbada bridge these stout columns were afterwards removed and replaced by vertical columns connected by a heavy cross girder on the top similar to those in use at the Narbada bridge. The foundation of the bridge is at its deepest point sunk about fifty feet below ground and 127 below rail level. The rail is carried on the top instead of as in the Narbada and other viaducts at the bottom of the girders. On the 3rd of August 1871 the river rose within twenty-four feet of rail level, sixty-two feet above the bed of the stream. One of the upstream columns was broken by drift timber, but the remaining four columns of the pier were strong enough to hold up the bridge and keep the line open.\n\nFor postal purposes the Kaira district forms a part of the Gujar\u00e1t postal division, and contains thirteen post offices located at the following stations: Kaira, M\u00e1tar, Cambay, \u00c1nand, Borsad, V\u00e1sad, Nadi\u00e1d, Mehmadabad, Mahudha, Kapadvanj, Th\u00e1sra, Umreth, and D\u00edkor. These offices are supervised by the inspector of post offices in the Gujar\u00e1t division, assisted by the sub-inspector of the Kaira district and the Rewa K\u00e1ntha states. Except at Kaira and V\u00e1sad, the officials in charge of post offices are styled deputy postmasters and are paid yearly salaries varying from \u00a318 to \u00a360 (Rs. 180-600) and averaging \u00a337 12s. 9d. (Rs. 376-6-0). The official at V\u00e1sad, styled a post k\u00e1rkun, draws an annual salary of \u00a314 (Rs. 140).\n\nAs the Kaira town station is the disbursing office of the district, the officer in charge is styled postmaster and draws a yearly salary of \u00a390 rising to \u00a3114 (Rs. 900-1140). From the stations mentioned above letters are distributed by delivery peons or by post runners. For this additional work the latter are paid a trifling gratuity. The correspondence for surrounding villages is delivered by rural messengers who also bring into the stations letters posted in letter-boxes placed at most of the villages. The rural messengers carry with them a stock of postage stamps for sale at the villages they visit. In the Kaira district there are in all seventeen delivery peons on yearly salaries ranging from \u00a39 12s. to \u00a312 (Rs. 96-120) and averaging \u00a39 17s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 98-13-0). The pay of the rural messengers, of whom there are eighteen, varies from \u00a39 12s. to \u00a312 (Rs. 96-120) a year and averages \u00a311 (Rs. 110). This staff of men is distributed according to requirements, letters being delivered in some places daily, and in others only once a week.\n\nThe only telegraph offices are those at the different railway stations.\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay Gazetteer, II., 419.\nThough in early times Kaira did not contain any very important centre of trade, many favourite lines of traffic passed through it.\\footnote{East India Papers, III., 686.} North and south, pretty much along the present main line of railway passed the trade between Ahmedabad and Baroda, Broach, and Surat; another line lay from the port of Tank\u00e1ri in Broach through Dehv\u00e1n, Petl\u00e1i, and Kaira to Ahmedabad; a third was from Cambay through Sojitra and Kaira to Ahmedabad. Lines also passed from the Gujar\u00e1t ports north-east through D\u00e1kor and Kapadyanj to M\u00e1lwa and Mew\u00e1r, and east through Dholka, Kaira, and Nadi\u00e1d. Judging from the small revenue from transit dues \u00a33630 (Rs. 36,300), the trade of the district at the time of its transfer to the British (1803) must have been scanty.\\footnote{Of the whole amount Nadi\u00e1d yielded \u00a32100, M\u00e1ter \u00a3630, Mahudha \u00a3600, Kaira \u00a3200, and N\u00e1p\u00e1d \u00a3100.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., XXXIX., 27. As there are no means of fixing the percentage charge of transit dues, these returns are necessarily vague.} In 1821 the consumption of imported articles is said to have been very small.\\footnote{Captain Robertson, 10th October 1819.\u2014Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 149 of 1820, 436.} In 1826 the manufactures of the district were valued at \u00a3166,326 (Rs. 16,63,260) and its trade at \u00a3443,594 (Rs. 44,35,940).\\footnote{Mr. Williamson's report, 1826. Trade with the interior was at that time much burdened by transit dues. In 1825, a year of scarcity in Gujar\u00e1t, wheat was selling at twenty-seven pounds the rupee in M\u00e1lwa and at nine in Baroda.\u2014Heb. Nar., II., 79.} Of the total amount of trade, merchandise valued at \u00a395,000 (Rs. 9,50,000), was returned as imported for consumption in the district, and property worth \u00a3348,594 (Rs. 34,85,940) as in transit from Cambay to Central India and other foreign territory.\\footnote{Mr. Kirkland, 343, 3rd November 1841.} In 1841 the chief articles of trade between Surat and Ahmedabad were silk raw and manufactured, cotton piece goods, gold thread, country paper, metal articles, wheat, and coriander seed; through Kaira to the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and M\u00e1lwa, and to Dongarpur and Mew\u00e1r, cumin seed, cardamoms, bishopsweed, betelnut, brimstone, camphor, coffee, cocoanuts without shells, cotton, dry ginger, gum, iron, indigo, catechu, and lace; from Jambusar and Tank\u00e1ri, through Dehv\u00e1n to Ahmedabad, long pepper, perfumes, dammer, soft sugar, sago, saltpetre, soap, cloves, cinnamon, and mace; from Cambay, black pepper, pearls, horses, charcoal, alum, tea, assafoetida, tobacco, sugarcandy, and molasses; and from Dholera, sandalwood, candles, tamarind, and rosewater.\\footnote{European cloth was in more general use than formerly. It was worn by the higher classes including the p\u00e1tid\u00e1rs. Kanbis, Kolis, and the other working classes still wore coarse country cloth.\u2014Collector 48-A, 31st January 1855.} In 1855, in consequence of the exorbitant customs duties levied by the Naw\u00e1b of Cambay and also by the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, the district trade, both in exports and imports, took instead of the straight road to Cambay, a circuitous course either to Dholera in Ahmedabad or Dehg\u00e1m in Broach. The chief articles of export were grain to Baroda; safflower to different Gujar\u00e1t ports; tobacco to M\u00e1lwa; cumin seed, aniseed, soap, and glass bangles to Bombay; and clarified butter to Surat. The chief articles of import were wheat, morinda roots or sorangi, cotton, and cloth from M\u00e1lwa; and sugar, spices, cocoanuts, metals, European piece goods,\\footnote{Glassware, paper, jewellery, and dates from Bombay. Shortly after 1855 the trade of} glassware, paper, jewellery, and dates from Bombay. Shortly after 1855 the trade of\nthe district would seem to have greatly increased. In 1861 at Kapadvanj, during the whole fair season, immense caravans were said to halt regularly on their way between Ahmedabad and Central India. Large quantities of tobacco grown in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, came to the Kapadvanj merchants to be sent to Malwa and Marwar, and piece goods, hardware, country manufactured cotton and silk robes, turbans, glass, soap, bangles, and many other articles were very largely exported from Kapadvanj to the Gaikwar's territories, the Mahi Kanta, the Panch Mahals, the Balasinor country, and Central India. In 1861-62 the imports of the Kapadvanj sub-division were valued at \u00a330,285 (Rs. 3,02,850) and the exports at \u00a325,420 (Rs. 2,54,200).\n\nBesides by improved roads, land traffic has been aided by the construction of a line of railway, that with a total length of forty miles runs through the whole breadth of the district north-east and south-west. This line finished in 1863 has, beginning with the south, six stations, Vasad, Navli, Anand, Boriavi, Nadiad, and Mehmabad. From the Anand station a line locally known as the Dakor branch runs north-east for a distance of thirty-two miles. This branch finished in 1874 has five stations, beginning from the west, Bhajaj, Umreth, Dakor, Thasra, and Pal. Traffic figures for the main line stations are available since 1868. From these returns it would seem that though compared with the earliest year, there is at present a considerable advance, the traffic was somewhat on the decline in passengers between 1871 and 1873, and in goods during 1871 and 1872. Since its opening in 1874, the increase in traffic on the Dakor branch has been much more rapid than on the main line. In 1874 the Dakor branch had twenty-eight per cent of the total passenger and nineteen per cent of the total goods traffic; in 1875, both in passengers and goods, its share rose to thirty-six, and in 1877 to fifty-two per cent. On the main line in 1868 there were four stations. The number was in 1870 increased to seven. Of these, Khambli had so small and so declining a traffic that, after being kept open for three years, it was closed. Both in passengers and goods the most important stations on the main line are Nadiad, Anand, Mehmabad, and Vasad. The remaining two stations, Navli and Boriavi have no goods, and a very small passenger traffic. The number of stations on the Dakor branch has since 1874 been increased from three to five. Of these, Dakor is the first passenger traffic station and Pal is the largest goods station in the whole district. Umreth stands second both in passengers and goods. Of the rest Bhajaj has no goods traffic, and Thasra shows but insignificant totals. The returns for all the stations in the district show that 346,746 passengers were carried in 1868, compared with 966,022 in 1877; while the traffic in goods has risen during the same period from 31,138 tons to 107,914 tons.

The following statement shows in tabular form the fluctuations in the chief articles of trade, carried from and to the different stations of the Kaira district.\n\n| Articles                  | 1868 | 1870 | 1872 | 1874 | 1877 |\n|---------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                           | Tons.| Tons.| Tons.| Tons.| Tons.|\n| Cotton, half-pressed       | 1031 | 1211 | 2807 | 1552 | 908  |\n| Cotton, unpressed          | 14   | 41   | 72   | 50   | 38   |\n| Cotton seed                | 33   | 3633 | 6070 | 3188 | 5377 |\n| Clarified butter           | 71   | 588  | 20   | 616  | 20   |\n| Grain and seed             | 1425 | 2767 | 7424 | 8026 | 5547 |\n| Mahuda                     | 4758 | 18   | 6011 | 14   | 3998 |\n| Metal                      | 34   | 1606 | 44   | 1870 | 42   |\n| Molasses                   | 24   | 2164 | 19   | 2204 | 37   |\n| Piece goods, European and  |      |      |      |      |      |\n| country                    | 49   | 906  | 57   | 1426 | 64   |\n| Sugar                     | 7    | 1211 | 2    | 183  | 3    |\n| Sundries                  | 8078 | 5041 | 3496 | 4212 | 2947 |\n| Timber                    | 257  | 1042 | 102  | 1427 | 143  |\n| Tobacco                   | 880  | 3    | 4161 | 1    | 4679 |\n| Twist, European and country| 19   | 495  | 15   | 559  | 9    |\n| Total                     | 12,307| 18,891| 22,151| 26,824| 20,498|\n\nFrom the above table it will be seen that the principal articles of export are unpressed and half-pressed cotton, clarified butter, mahuda, Bassia latifolia, grain, tobacco and since the opening of the P\u00e1li railway, timber. Glass and soap, though peculiar to the district, are not manufactured in such quantities as to contribute materially to its export trade. The principal articles of import are cotton-seed, metal, molasses, sugar, piece goods, twist, and timber.\n\nThe details for the Nadi\u00e1d station show an increase in the total number of passengers from 126,233 in 1868 to 175,367 in 1877, and in the quantity of goods from 16,430 tons in 1868 to 24,087 in 1877. During the ten years ending 1877, the greatest total number of passengers was 193,191 and of goods 27,240 tons, both in 1870; the lowest figures were in 1868. The returns for \u00c1nand show that passenger traffic has increased from 110,816 in 1868 to 151,722 in 1877, with the highest total of 172,387 passengers in 1870 and the lowest total of 79,370 in 1873. Goods traffic shows an increase from 10,263 tons in 1868 to 13,670 in 1877; the highest total was 14,694 tons in 1871 and the lowest 10,263 in 1868. At V\u00e1sad, goods traffic has increased from 3032 tons in 1868 to 12,910 tons in 1877; the highest total was 14,403 tons in 1876. On the D\u00e1kor branch, passenger traffic has increased from 182,421 in 1874 to 425,584 in 1877, and goods from 9161 tons in 1874 to 53,312 in 1877. The D\u00e1kor station returns show that passenger traffic has increased from 126,066 in 1874 to 284,330 in 1877; goods traffic shows an increase from 5832 in 1874 to 9626 in 1877. Like D\u00e1kor, Umreth shows a considerable increase in goods traffic, the total for 1874 being 3329 tons against 11,148 in 1877. The following statement contrasts in\ntabular form the passenger and goods traffic at each of the stations of the Kaira district in 1868, 1870, 1872, 1874, and 1877.\n\n### Kaira Railway, Passengers

The butter is made from the milk of cows, buffaloes, sheep, and goats. The makers are Kanbis, Kolis, Rajputs, Rab\u00e1ris, and Bharv\u00e1ds, as well as Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s, Dheds, and others of the depressed castes. The better class of ghi makers trade direct with V\u00e1nia, Bh\u00e1tia, and Loh\u00e1na dealers; the lowcaste makers trade\n\n---\n\n1 Clarified butter has for many years been one of the chief Kaira exports. In 1824 the Petl\u00e1d, now Borsad, cultivators exported large quantities of ghi. In their own carts and with their own bullocks they made every year four or five trips south bringing back cotton seed. They also took ghi east to H\u00e1lo\u0142 and K\u00e1lol and brought back raw sugar.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., XI., 110.\nthrough Musalm\u00e1n brokers. The local dealers buying in small quantities collect a large stock. This they are said to adulterate sometimes by mixing different sorts of ghi, sometimes by adding sesamum, tal, poppy seed, khaskhas, or mahuda berry oil. The mixing over, the dealers store the ghi in large leather bottles. These bottles they either export at their own risk or store at the ghi markets to meet the demands of foreign dealers. The chief markets are Anand, Umreth, N\u00e1vli, and Karamsad, where buyers come from Surat, Baroda, Broach, Jambusar, Cambay, Bh\u00e1vnagar, Gogha, Wadhwan, Limbdi, Dholera, and Bombay.\n\nTobacco another of the chief exports is sent to Gujar\u00e1t, M\u00e1lwa, and the Deccan. Details of the tobacco trade have been already given (p. 47).\n\nUntil the opening of steam factories at Ahmedabad and Nadi\u00e1d (1870-1876), the spinning and weaving of cotton was, next to agriculture, the most important industry of the district. Almost all the women, both in towns and villages, were formerly to some extent engaged in spinning cotton thread. But the competition of local steam factories has greatly reduced the demand for handspun yarn. Formerly cloth woven by Dheds and Musalm\u00e1ns was, besides meeting the local demand, sent to Ratl\u00e1m and other parts of India. This cloth, coarse and very strong, served both for clothes and sacking. But of late years the demand for both purposes has greatly fallen. For sacking, Bengal jute cloth has to a large extent taken the place of the local manufacture, and the wearing cloth, which from its greater strength and cheapness had little to fear from the competition of European piece goods, has now been to a great extent ousted by the produce of Bombay and Gujar\u00e1t weaving mills. Fine cloth for robes, s\u00e1dis, waistcloths, and pantaloons are woven by Momna and T\u00e1i Musalm\u00e1ns, and a few Hindus of the Khatri caste. Able to buy yarn cheaper than formerly, weavers of this class, though competition has reduced their profits, find a market for their goods. Calico printing and dyeing are carried on to a considerable extent, chiefly in Nadi\u00e1d, Kaira, D\u00e1kor, Umreth, Mehmadabad, Anand, Sast\u00e1pur, Kathl\u00e1i, M\u00e1tar, and Kapadvanj. Except for a few M\u00e1rv\u00e1di Musalm\u00e1ns, these industries are in the hands of Hindus of the Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1r caste, who number 3883 souls. Kaira water is thought specially useful for dyeing, and its prints have a good name. Besides a widespread home demand they are exported to Siam and other places. Some of the printers are men of capital and prepare articles on their own account. They buy their cloth and colours either from Ahmedabad or Bombay merchants, and sell their prints in lots on the spot to V\u00e1nia dealers, some of whom come from considerable distances. Their trade has suffered from competition. Many of them are said to be giving up printing and taking to other occupations. In 1876 (Aug. 17) a steam spinning mill with engines of fifty horse power and 9744 spindles, 6584 of them mule and 3360 throttle, was at a cost of\n\n---\n\n1 These bottles or kund\u00e1s, made by men of the Dabgar caste, vary in price from 2s. to 5s., and in capacity from 60 to 200 pounds (1\u00bd to 5 mans.)\n\u00a348,500 (Rs. 4,85,000) started at Nadiad. Of the 400 \u00a3100 shares only 239 had been taken up. The shareholders belonged chiefly to Bombay. Hardly any local residents had any interest in the mill. Forced to borrow to make up deficiencies and meet expenses, in spite of the local advantages of cheap cotton and labour and large local demand, from heavy interest, dull trade, and cheap yarn the mill worked at a loss and after 2\u00bd years (Dec. 1878) had to be closed. While at work the mill employed nearly 300 hands, two-thirds of them local, Hindus of the Khed\u00e1val Br\u00e1hman, Khatri, Tapodhan, Kanbi, Koli, V\u00e1gthri, and R\u00e1valia castes and Musalm\u00e1ns in about equal numbers. Monthly wage payments averaged about \u00a3260 (Rs. 2600) and the yearly consumption of cotton about 357 tons (1000 khandis). The cotton came from Ahmedabad, Viramg\u00e1m, Wadhw\u00e1n, Baroda, Broach, and sometimes from Surat. The yarn was sold chiefly in the Kaira, Baroda, and Ahmedabad districts and in smaller quantities in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, and P\u00e1li.\n\nGlass-making has its headquarters at Kapadvanj. The workers are Musalm\u00e1ns. The glass is made in large earthen furnaces in form like huge slipper baths, the floor sloping forwards to holes prepared to receive the melted glass. The furnace inside is baked as hard and looks as white and slippery as ice. The component parts of the glass are alkali, us, and impure carbonate of soda, sajji kh\u00e1r, and a dark coloured flinty sand from Jeypur. These are mixed together, placed in the furnaces, and thoroughly boiled for hours. When ready the boiling mass is allowed to run into a trench where it remains till cool. It is then broken into small pieces, remelted, and in this liquid state made into bangles, beads, bottles, glasses, and fancy animals chiefly peacocks. The last are extremely thin and brittle, smashing to pieces when touched.\u00b9 The produce of the Kapadvanj glass factories goes chiefly to Bombay and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\n\nSoap is manufactured by Musalm\u00e1ns. It is made by mixing alkali, soda, and lime in water and allowing them to soak for some hours. The water is then drawn off and a quantity of mah\u00fada oil, doliv, is added, and the whole boiled in large brick caldrons. When ready the mixture is run off into shallow brick troughs and left to cool. It is then gathered into a large heap, pounded with heavy wooden mallets, and cut into round cakes. According to the amount of mah\u00fada oil it contains, soap varies in price from 1\u00bdd. to 3d. (1-2 annas) the cake.\u00b2 It is sent to Ahmedabad, Surat, Broach, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and Bombay. The soap trade is entirely in the hands of Musalm\u00e1ns of the D\u00e1ndi Bohora sect.\n\nA district whose wealth and traffic are almost entirely agricultural, has naturally little trade organization. The use of the word mah\u00e1jan or great men is entirely social, applied to the members of the V\u00e1nia, Shravak, and Soni castes. They have no guilds for trade purposes, and among none of the artisan classes does the practice of apprenticeship prevail.\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 721. \u00b2 Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 722.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nCrossed by so many of the chief lines of traffic between upper and central India and the coast, the district contains settlements of very great antiquity.\\(^1\\) Under its different Rajput dynasties (746-1290) the lands of Kaira were, except perhaps Th\u00e1sra and Kapadvanj, included in the settled and directly-managed portions of the Anhilv\u00e1da domain. At the end of the fourteenth century they passed under the Musalm\u00e1n kings of Ahmedabad, and with the other crown lands were in 1573 transferred to the Moghals.\\(^2\\) From about 1720 to 1750 the district was the scene of almost unceasing conflicts between the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and the Musalm\u00e1n viceroys and nobles. Except that the Kaira estate was for ten years left in the hands of the B\u00e1bi family, on the capture of Ahmedabad (1753) the districts were shared between the Peshwa and the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, and remained with them till made over to the British, partly in 1803 and partly in 1817.\n\n\\(^1\\) See Kaira and Kapadvanj.\n\n\\(^2\\) Except Kapadvanj, the whole of the district was included in T\u00f3dar Mal's Survey (1590).\u2014Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec., II. of 1821, 672.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION.\n\nPart of the lands of the district came into British possession in 1803, and the rest in 1817. Under the terms of the treaty of Bassein (1802, December 31st) the N\u00e1pad group of villages was handed over by the Peshwa.\\(^1\\) In 1803, for the maintenance of the troops supplied by the British Government, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r ceded Nadi\u00e1d, M\u00e1tar, and Mahudha.\\(^2\\) In this year also, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r granted in perpetual gift the fort and town of Kaira, as a proof of his friendship and as a testimony of his sense of the benefit he received from his alliance with the Honourable Company's Government.\\(^3\\) Under the treaty of the 6th November 1817, to provide for the regular payment of additional troops, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r ceded Mehmadabad, Alina, Th\u00e1sra, Antroli, and half of the town and district of Petl\u00e1l.\\(^4\\) At the same time Kapadvanj and Bh\u00e1laj\\(^5\\) were received in exchange for the district of Bij\u00e1pur in north Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t.\n\nThe territories acquired in 1803, along with Dholka, Dhandhuka, R\u00e1npur, and Gogha now part of the Ahmedabad district, remained from the date of their cession to the 14th May 1805, in charge of the Resident at Baroda. During that time, a European assistant and native officers administered according to local usages the police and justice of the country. In 1805 a Collector was appointed with jurisdiction over the ceded districts, both those to the north of the Mahi and those to the west of the Gulf of Cambay.\\(^6\\) In the same year the town of Kaira was chosen to be a large military station. The increase in British possessions, that followed the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r treaty of 6th November 1817, called for fresh administrative arrangements.\\(^7\\) The territory north of the Mahi was, from the 1st January 1818, divided into two districts.

In 1830 Kapadvanj was included in Ahmedabad, and Kaira reduced to a sub-collectorate under the Principal Collector of Ahmedabad. In 1833 Ahmedabad and Kaira were again separated. Since then, more than once, villages have been moved from one district to the other, and the original irregular groups and collections of villages have been gradually consolidated into seven sub-divisions. Of these, under the Collector's charge, three are generally entrusted to the covenanted first assistant, three to the uncovenanted district deputy collector, and one kept by the Collector under his own control. The supervision of the district treasury is in the hands of another uncovenanted assistant styled the head-quarter, huzur, deputy collector. These officers are also assistants to the Collector as district magistrate, and those of them who have revenue charge of portions of the district have, under the presidency of the Collector, the chief management of the different administrative bodies, local fund and municipal committees, within the limits of their revenue charge.\n\nUnder the supervision of the Collector and his assistant or deputy, the revenue charge of each fiscal division of the district is placed in the hands of an officer styled m\u00e1mlat\u00edd\u00e1r. These functionaries, who are also entrusted with magisterial powers, have yearly salaries varying from \u00a3180 to \u00a3300 (Rs. 1800-Rs. 3000). One of the fiscal divisions, Borsad, contains a petty division, peta mah\u00e1l, placed under the charge of an officer styled mah\u00e1lkari on \u00a372 (Rs. 720) a year. The duty of this officer is to collect cesses from the Cambay State, and to forward the money to the Borsad treasury.\n\nIn revenue and police matters, the charge of the 525 Government villages is entrusted to 573 headmen, of whom twenty-three are stipendiary and 550 are hereditary. Thirty-one of the hereditary, but none of the stipendiary, headmen perform revenue duties only; forty-seven of the former and three of the latter attend to matters of police only, while twenty stipendiary and 472 hereditary headmen are entrusted with both revenue and police duties. The headman's yearly pay depends on the revenue derived from his village. It varies from \u00a31 to \u00a365 (Rs. 10-650) the average receipts amounting to \u00a36 6s. (Rs. 63). Besides the headman, in many villages members of his family receive Government grants amounting altogether to a yearly sum of \u00a31673 (Rs. 16,730), of which \u00a3309 (Rs. 3090) are met by assignments of land and \u00a31364 (Rs. 13,640) are paid in cash. Of \u00a34575 (Rs. 45,750), the total yearly charge on account of village headmen, \u00a3658 (Rs. 6580) are met by assignments of land and \u00a33917 (Rs. 39,170) are paid in cash.\n\n---\n\n1 Reg. III. of 1819, Sec. III.\n2 Till the survey settlement is introduced a third uncovenanted assistant styled daftard\u00e1r is sanctioned for the Panch Mah\u00e1ls districts. This officer works under the Collector of Kaira during the rainy season, and during the fair weather under the extra First Assistant Collector of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls.\n3 These men called betha bh\u00e1gia or sitting sharers, are without doing any work entitled to a share of the office perquisites.\nThe village accountants, *tal\u00e1tis*, who under the headmen keep the village accounts and draw up statistical and other returns, number in all 325, or about one accountant for every two villages, each charge containing on an average 2357 inhabitants and yielding an average yearly rental of \u00a3584 (Rs. 5840). Their yearly salaries, paid in cash, averaging \u00a319 (Rs. 190) vary from \u00a312 to \u00a324 (Rs. 120-Rs. 240) and represent a total yearly charge of \u00a36151 (Rs. 61,510). Besides the stipendiary accountants, there is, in Kapadvanj, an hereditary *tal\u00e1t\u00ed* to whom a yearly cash allowance of \u00a324 (Rs. 240) is paid.\n\nUnder the headmen and the village accountants are the village servants with a total strength of 2949. These men are liable both for revenue and for police duties. They are either Musalm\u00e1ns or Hindus of the Bhil, Koli, Dhed, and Bhangia castes. The total yearly grant for the support of this establishment amounts to \u00a36901 (Rs. 69,010), being \u00a32 6s.

The parts of north Gujar\u00e1t, made over to the British in 1802 (December 31st), formed three belts: one between the Narbada and Mahi, a second between the Mahi and S\u00e1barmati, and a third to the north and west of the S\u00e1barmati. These territories varied much in condition and in the character of their people. The southern belt was orderly and ready to receive a regular administration; the central, with many villages of peaceful and well-to-do cultivators, contained a warlike and unruly class; and of the northern, especially westwards to K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, a large part were Koli and Rajput states included within the British territory and subject to a tribute, but in other respects left to manage their own affairs.

The villages belonged to three classes, the quiet r\u00e1sti, the refractory mehv\u00e1s or gir\u00e1s, and an intermediate class the r\u00e1sti-mehv\u00e1s. The central lands of Nadi\u00e1d and N\u00e1p\u00e1d, and to a less degree those of M\u00e1tar and Mahudha, were almost free from the turbulent classes. But in the outlying tracts, both to the north and the south-east, was a large unruly population and many unsettled villages both of the Rajput or gir\u00e1s, and of the Koli or mehv\u00e1s, types. Of the claims put forward by the two classes of holders of unruly villages, those of the Rajputs, as the rulers of the land at the time of the Musalm\u00e1n conquest, and as at once the more warlike and more civilized race, were more respected than those of the Kolis. Though they probably at one time held the whole country, the Kolis would seem to have been considered rebellious, or at least refractory villagers, who had from its weakness resisted or eluded the just claims of the former Government. Both paid a tribute, and Government might raise its amount. But it was not usual to interfere with the inner management of their villages or to examine their revenues. Compared with the lands to the north of the S\u00e1barmati,\u00b9 the Kaira district had few unruly villages of the Rajput class. Its Koli or mehv\u00e1s villages, chiefly to the east and south, under chiefs, th\u00e1kors,\u00b2 were most of them wretched groups of thatched beehive-like huts. Some of them included several distinct hamlets, v\u00e1s, each with boundaries, husbandmen, and a chief of its own, responsible for a certain share of the whole Government demand on the village. Compared with the peaceful villages, the revenue they yielded was small, the amount fixed more by the chief's power of resisting than by his ability to pay. Rebellious and insubordinate, many of the refractory villages especially those near the Mahi, except under pressure of force, refused to pay their tribute.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 In 1821 after many mehv\u00e1s villages had become quiet, there remained seventy-two.\n\u00b2 Ham. Des. of Hindust\u00e1n, I., 622.\n\u00b3 The application of gir\u00e1s to Rajput and mehv\u00e1s to Koli villages was first clearly made by Mr. Elphinstone (1821). Colonel Walker (1804) did not bring out this distinction, and Mr. Prendergast (29th June 1821) doubted its correctness. Mr. Prendergast says, mehv\u00e1s villages are chiefly situated in broken ground, the word is used whether the population is Koli, Rajput, or Bhil (East India Papers, III., 705). In support of the distinction Mr. Elphinstone contended that mehv\u00e1s was used in the sense of refractory, and that as all independence on the part of a Koli was reckoned usurpation and was not in a Rajput, the term had come to be limited to Koli villages (East India Papers, III., 708). This word was, apparently in the sense of forest, used in Gujar\u00e1t in the twelfth century (Ind. Ant. IV. 74 and 76). Its origin has recently (Major J. W. Watson, Ind. Ant. VI. 79) been traced to Mah\u00e1uds that is Mahi dwellings. This would fairly well explain its Gujar\u00e1t and Central India meaning. But the use of it by Minh\u00e1ju-s-Siraj (about 1250), to describe wild and forest lands between the Gauges and Jamna, makes this local explanation doubtful (Elliot's Hist. II. 362 and note.) Professor M. M. Kunte\nIn quiet or r\u00e1sti villages, the lands were divided into two classes, those made over to private persons either free of rent, nakru, or on a quitrent, sal\u00e1mi, and Government or sark\u00e1ri lands let out for tillage. The private or alienated lands claimed to be grants made either by Government or by village managers. Government grants were either religious, vazifa, political, v\u00e1nta and mal\u00edki, or to foster irrigation, kuvelar. Village grants were to please dangerous neighbours, gir\u00e1s, pag\u00eda, b\u00e1ria, koliapa, and dab\u00e1nia; to reward village services, pas\u00e1ita, h\u00e1ria, runvatia, and p\u00e1lia; to reduce the pressure of Government demand, vech\u00e1nia and gir\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1. Of Government religious grants, vazifa, properly a Musalm\u00e1n religious grant, was used to include all personal grants by Musalm\u00e1n rulers, whether as charity, favour, or in return for service. The area of land held under this tenure was small. Of Government political grants the v\u00e1nta or share lands were originally allotted by king Ahmed I. (1411-1443) to the former Rajput proprietors, and either left in their hands or restored to them by the Emperor Akbar (1583). Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, by sale, mortgage, and encroachment, the share had in most cases ceased to form any thing like the one-fourth part of the whole village area. Still, in Colonel Walker's (1804) opinion, the right to the share 'maintained by arms and by an unconquerable sentiment was secured to the holders by universal consent, and was,' when he wrote, 'unimpaired in its privileges.'\u00b9 The boundaries of the share were marked off, and there was generally a distinct quarter of the village where the holder of v\u00e1nta lands and his dependents lived.\u00b2 Lands of this class were, in some cases, held by the whole family as joint property, in others, kept in separate shares, or managed for the owner by the village headman. Under the head of v\u00e1nta comes sirjamin, land granted by a holder of v\u00e1nta for the maintenance of his wife. Even if the rest of the share escheated to Government, this part remained in the hands of the woman's heirs.\n\nThe other chief political Government grant was to the class of Musalm\u00e1ns called Maliks. These Maliks were descendants of soldiers, who, for their special valour at the siege of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad (1483), were by Mahmud Begada (1459-1513) presented with about ninety square miles of land on the banks of the Mahi to the north and north-east of\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel., XXXIX., New Series, 23. Later on (1821) this origin of v\u00e1nta was disputed. Mr. Prendergast (29th June 1821) objected to the explanation given in the text, holding that v\u00e1nta lands were encroachments. But Mr. Elphinstone kept to Colonel Walker's view. In his opinion, under the old Hindu sovereigns, the Rajputs divided the country among their chief's relations, and the Musalm\u00e1ns when they came kept three-fourths and left a one-fourth share to the Rajput chiefs (East India Papers, III., 708). See also Mr. Williamson's report in Bom. Gov. Litho., Papers, 149, 9.\n\n\u00b2 Mr. Williamson.\u2014Bom. Gov. Litho. Papers, 149, 9.\nTh\u00e1sra. At the time of the grant these lands were divided among twelve villages; in 1817, when with the rest of Th\u00e1sra they came under British rule, they numbered seventeen; and in 1864 had increased to twenty-seven. For more than two hundred years, taking half of the produce from the cultivators, the Maliks continued to hold these villages rentfree. About the beginning of the eighteenth century the Peshwa\u2019s Government imposed a lump tribute, udhard jam\u00e1bandi on the mal\u00edki villages, the amount varying according to the success of the Maliks in resisting the Mar\u00e1tha demands. To meet this tribute, the Maliks put a property cess, karam vero, on their tenants and reduced their own share of the produce, vaje, from a half to a third. Fifty years later (1769) the Mar\u00e1thas put forward another claim in the shape of support, gh\u00e1sd\u00e1na, for the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s revenue collecting force. Some of the villages also became liable to a payment to the B\u00e1bi of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor. These exactions were met out of the property cess, haram vero, but in some years the Maliks were so hard pressed, that to meet the demand they had to part with a considerable quantity of land. In 1817, when Th\u00e1sra came under British management, accountants were placed in the Maliki villages and a field register of all the lands was prepared. An acreage rate was imposed on Government lands not tilled by the Maliks, and a quitrent on the alienated land. As the Maliks still levied special cesses to meet their tribute to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and the B\u00e1bi of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor, the new assessment pressed the cultivators so hard, that they began to desert their villages. To prevent this a new settlement was made in 1819. The cesses on the cultivators of Government land, not in the Maliks\u2019 hands, were consolidated into one acreage rate varying considerably according to the cultivator\u2019s caste. The Maliks were to continue to hold the lands they tilled rentfree, and from other unalienated land, instead of the produce share, were to recover a fixed money payment. As to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s tribute, Government in some cases agreed to pay the whole, and in others only the half. Two years later, failure of crops forced a reduction of assessment, the loss of revenue being borne in somewhat larger proportion by Government than by the Maliks. In 1824 Government accountants were withdrawn from the Maliks\u2019 villages, and the privilege of self-management, granted to the Koli and Rajput chiefs in 1821, was extended to the Maliks. Soon after, the villages were on paying Government a lump sum leased to the Maliks, and they were left free to alter the rates of assessment as they chose. The leases lasted till 1837 when the arrangement sanctioned in 1819 and 1823 was again introduced. In 1843 and again in 1850 district officers complained that the Maliks had so adjusted the assessment, that while the Government share had been reduced by one-half the Malik\u2019s share was about one-fourth larger than in 1819 and the following years. But Government were unwilling to interfere till in 1860, on the introduction of the revenue survey, the Maliks were asked if they would continue to manage their villages, paying Government a fixed rental. To this they would not agree, stating that the number of sharers was too great to give them any chance.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Mills (1828) in his Jam\u00e1bandi report speaks of them as the b\u00e1rg\u00e1m or twelve villages.\nof managing their villages successfully. After a detailed inquiry into the state of the different villages, Government finally decided to adopt the proposal of Mr. Pedder, the settlement officer, that the villages should be managed by Government officers under the ordinary survey rules, and that the Maliks should be allowed to hold the lands cultivated by themselves in 1819 rentfree, and for the rest receive a share varying from seven to nine sixteenths of the revenue. Village accountants chosen by the Maliks were appointed and paid by Government.\n\nThe Government grants in favour of irrigation were *kwetar* or well lands given to the builder of a well. The scale varied according to the cost of the well and the amount of land watered. But the rule was about three-quarters of an acre (1\u00bd *bigh\u00e1s*) for each pair of bullocks that could be employed in drawing water.\n\nOf village grants to please dangerous neighbours the chief was *gir\u00e1s*, literally a mouthful. In Kaira at the beginning of British rule, *gir\u00e1s* in almost all cases meant a sum paid to a powerful neighbour for protection and assistance or to an unruly villager as the price of forbearance. Originally the words *gir\u00e1s* and *gir\u00e1sia* were applied to rightful hereditary Rajput claims. But during the eighteenth century misrule, the terms had been extended to the demands of all who to the will added the power to annoy. The claim generally rested on prescriptive enjoyment. It was seldom supported by written deeds, and its levy by force was the cause of much misery and uneasiness. Under the British Government an arrangement was at an early date (1812) introduced, under which instead of levying them by force the *gir\u00e1sias* agreed to attend at the Government offices and be paid their claims. They were at the same time made to furnish security for orderly behaviour. They were bound to help in suppressing gang robberies, and warned that if caught in any disturbance, they should forfeit their allowances. Under the same head come *pagia*, *b\u00e1ria*, and *koliapa* all of them lands held by Kolis. These, the holders declared, were originally assigned to them in the same way as *v\u00e1nta* lands were assigned to the Rajputs. Grants of this kind may have been made, but they were probably much added to by the Kolis, as it was a common practice with men of this class to hire a field from the manager of a village, and after paying rent for a year or two, trusting to the timidity of the other villagers, to declare that it was family, *b\u00e1pita* land. Some of the grants of this class, especially those called *pagia* or tracker\u2019s land, had another origin. They were given in reward for tracking thieves and to make the holder responsible for all thefts traced to the village. As a rule conditions of this kind were neglected or denied. To this class may be added *dab\u00e1nia*, a general term for lands acquired either by usurpation or encroachment and kept by the threat of injuring the village manager.\n\nOf grants made in reward for village services besides the *pagia* or tracker\u2019s land, were *pas\u00e1tia*, *h\u00e1ria*, *ranvatia*, and *p\u00e1lia*. *Pas\u00e1tia*, originally religious grants to Br\u00e1hmans and Bh\u00e1ts, to temples and to\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 311-406.\ncharitable institutions, came to be applied to grants by village managers to sub-division and village officers. Grants of this kind were generally marked by the name of the holder's office as des\u00e1i or superintendent's pas\u00e1ita, amin or assistant superintendent's pas\u00e1ita, and r\u00e1vania or watchman's pas\u00e1ita. The holder would seem to have been allowed to dispose of the land as he pleased. When the first grant was disposed of, the office either fell into disuse or was supported by fresh grants of land. H\u00e1ria the victim's field, ranvatia the warrior's field, and p\u00e1lia the tombstone field, were grants made by village officers in return for loss of life in the cause of the village. H\u00e1ria was land granted to the family of a man slain in guarding the village; ranvatia land granted to the family of a villager slain in an attack on some enemy; and p\u00e1lia a field granted that the family of a religious man, a Br\u00e1hman or a Bh\u00e1t, who had killed himself in the interest of the village, might set up a tomb in his honour.\n\nOf grants made by village managers to relieve the pressure of Government demands, the chief were vech\u00e1nia land sold, and gir\u00e1nia land mortgaged. Lands disposed of in this way were held either rentfree or subject to a quitrent. The mortgaged lands were of three kinds: simple, where the property was to be held till the debt was paid; valatd\u00e1nia, where after paying interest the produce of the land was to go to clear off the bond; \u00fadera, where in a certain time the land was to go back to the mortgagor; and s\u00e1n, where the land was pledged by the owner but not handed over unless he failed to pay. During the time of Mar\u00e1tha exactions, the practice of making these grants was carried so far, that in 1804 in Nadi\u00e1d of 34,436 acres only 10,183, and in N\u00e1p\u00e1d of 7046 acres only 1942 paid Government assessment. A large number of these grants were fraudulent. The sale or mortgage was nominal. The village managers paying a quitrent, tilled the land or transferred it to their own names with an entry that they had been received in exchange for some valuable consideration.\n\nCultivators of Government, talpat, lands in peaceful, r\u00e1sti, Government land, villages, generally held them under one of three tenures. The commonest was for the cultivator to have a certain area of land allotted to him, some of it good, some of it middling, and some of it poor. He paid only on the land under actual cultivation; and so long as he paid, it was understood that he could not be turned out. The second was known as kh\u00e1t\u00e1bandi or the holding system. Under it the cultivator held a perpetual lease of some very good soil and with it a share of inferior but very lightly taxed land. A certain sum was fixed on the entire holding, and this had to be paid whether or not it was all tilled. A superior form of the kh\u00e1t\u00e1 tenure was when the allotment of land was called vehta. On the allotted land a very high assessment, in some cases six times as much as it would naturally pay, was charged. The amount of land allotted to each cultivator, varying from half an acre to two acres, depended\n\n---\n\n1 Quitrents, sal\u00e1mi, varied from a few pence an acre to the full acreage charge. Once put on, the quitrent was generally kept and sometimes raised.\u2014Mr. Williamson, Bom. Gov. Litho. Papers, 149, 14.\nchiefly on the alienated land in his hands, which he continued to hold either rentfree or subject to a quitrent. If his state improved, he was forced to add to his share of vehta, and if unlucky, he was allowed to give some up. The holder of vehta land was part-owner of the village. He could mortgage the land, and unless the Government raised the village payment, his rent could not be increased. In villages where the area of Government land was too small to supply a share for each cultivator, the quantity required was taken from the alienated land, and in return a quitrent was paid to the owner. In villages where, after the lots were distributed, some Government land remained over, a rate of payment was fixed, and the land, called kh\u00e1tia, was distributed among the vehta holders. In villages inhabited only by shareholders the balance of the alienated land was assessed and distributed in the same way as kh\u00e1tia land. The principle of vehta and kh\u00e1tia lands, the allotment of a certain area of greatly over-assessed land, was the same. Both were remnants of the perfect sharehold or narva village described below. Both in sharehold and in vehta villages the body of owners were liable for the whole Government demand. They differed in this, that in a perfect sharehold or narva village each member paid according to his hereditary share; in a vehta village the share varied according to the member's power to pay. In a kh\u00e1t\u00e1bandi village the management was in the hand of a contractor or Government officer and the joint responsibility had ceased. The third practice was for the cultivator to take out a written lease, ganvat, engaging to till the land for one year. This land, lying in most cases beyond the enclosed parts of the village, was too poor to have fixed holders. It was generally tilled by uparuddias or workmen from a neighbouring village. If a cultivator kept on tilling the same field for several years, he would have to take out a running lease or ch\u00e1l\u00fa ganvat. Under this arrangement there was no regular cess, bighoti, for the different qualities of land; the rate varied with the crop, or each field had its own rate. Unless he gave notice, a cultivator had to pay the cess on all the land he held.\n\nExcept Government grants and hereditary shares, the lands were not the property of the holders; they were let out to the cultivators by the village headmen. If the cultivator failed to pay his share, his crops, and except his tools, his property were attached, Government\n\n---\n\n1 A village so held was called narva. It differed from the ordinary narva, because the division was not as in the ordinary form according to the regular Hindu rules of division, but was according to the holder's means. Captain Robertson gives this as an example of the details of a vehta holding. R\u00e1m\u00e1da Ishv\u00e1rd\u00e1s of the village of Majfral holds altogether 56 acres of land, and pays a rent of \u00a314 18s. (Rs. 149). Of the 56 acres one and a half of vehta land paid \u00a310 4s. (Rs. 102); 16 acres of quit-rent land paid \u00a34 14s. (Rs. 47); and 40 acres were held rentfree.\u2014Kaira Outward Rev. Book, 1821.\n\n2 Mr. Williamson, Bom. Gov. Litho. Papers., 149, 5. Leases were also granted in certain special cases. In the small state of Kaira the land was (1804) leased to the cultivators for terms of from three to five years, the cultivators engaging to pay either half of the crop in kind or its money value. It was also the custom for a revenue farmer when he found a village ruined or waste to lease it. The lessee might again parcel out the lands of the village in leases.\u2014Col. Walker (1804) Bom. Gov. Sel., XXXIX., 9, 25.\n\n3 Capt. Robertson, Kaira Rev., Outward Book, 1821.\nrecovering one-eighth in addition to their regular share of the produce. Still the cultivator had prescriptive rights and was seldom turned out of land which he or his family had long held. When too hard pressed\\(^1\\) his usual resource, both in Government and in alienated villages, was to move into another district, and either settle there or wait till his grievance was redressed. Revenue farmers sometimes agreed to prevent these movements, refusing to give immigrants work; but as a rule they were not slow to make use of the services of any workman who wanted employment.\n\nThe villagers' payments were of two kinds: a rental or \\(jama\\), and cesses \\(vera\\) or \\(babat\\). The land tax was paid either in kind by a division of the produce called \\(th\u00e1gbat\u00e1ri\\), or by an acreage rate, \\(bighoti\\). When payment was taken in kind, the produce was divided by the Government agent and the village headman. The division was made either in the field, the \\(koltar\\) system,\\(^2\\) or in the village farmyard, the \\(kh\u00e1lvad\\) system. Though in different places it varied to some extent, except in the case of Kolis, Musalm\u00e1ns, and other unskilled cultivators who paid specially easy rates, the Government share was held to be one-half of the rain crop and from one-third to one-fifth of the dry weather crop if raised by irrigation. From their share of the produce the cultivators had generally to pay the village officers\\(^3\\) an allowance in grain, and in some cases a charge for moving the grain to headquarters. As regards the acreage rate, \\(bighoti\\), there were remains of the old measurements of R\u00e1ja Todar Mal, the Emperor Akbar's surveyor (1583-1590).\\(^4\\) A record of the areas was kept, and though disregarded by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, his rates were still cherished by the people. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the rent depended on several considerations. First, the character of the soil, the lands being divided into three classes and paying rent according to their fertility. Second, the kind of crop grown, millet paying from 10s. to 12s. an acre, and sugarcane from 15s. to 30s. A third point was the distance of the field from the village site; and a fourth, the distance of the village from a market. For the benefit of the less skilled class of cultivators, Kolis, Musalm\u00e1ns, and others, two special forms of payment were in use, one a uniform acre cess called \\(ghatt\u00e1ch\u00e1s\\), the other a lump sum or \\(udhadsal\u00e1mi\\) on the entire holding.\n\nBesides the land tax many cesses, \\(ver\u00fas\\), were enforced, those on ploughs, carts, cattle, and horses, falling on landholders; and those\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Williamson (1826) mentions a custom at Mehmadabad that must have pressed hard on the cultivators. At the beginning of the field season their ploughs were taken and kept till they agreed to till a certain area of land.\n\n2 Of the \\(koltar\\) system there were three varieties, \\(ubha\\), when the crop was valued standing; \\(uga\\), when the crop was valued cut; and an estimate or \\(dal\\) founded on the examination of a portion of the field.\u2014Bom.

The object of the cesses on tillage was to draw a revenue from rentfree land. To prevent the payment of cesses bearing too hard on the tenant of revenue paying land, a reduction of the land tax equal to the amount of the cess was often made. Besides the indirect cesses rentfree lands were made to contribute in two ways, by an acreage quitrent or sal\u00e1mi, and by a varying cess or sv\u00e1d on Government cultivators who tilled rentfree lands.\n\nThere were four forms of village government. The commonest known as the simple, sejo, form, was for the village headman to engage annually for the payment of a certain sum to Government. The headman realized the amount of the demand according to the established rates and customs of the village, the rights of the owners of alienated lands and of cultivators of every sort remaining unchanged. The profits of a good year went to the headman and he had to bear any loss from failure of crops or short tillage. Another form of management, common in the richer Kaira villages, was the narua or share system. Under this the headman's responsibility was divided among the members of his family. In such cases the different branches of the family were traced back to their common ancestor, and the village divided into as many shares, bh\u00e1g, as that ancestor had sons. Each share was made over to the representatives of one son, and they divided it into as many lots as there were men in their branch. The head of each branch was called bh\u00e1gdar or patel. He acted for the other shareholders, but interfered in no way with their management of their shares. Sometimes the headman's family tilled the whole village. In other cases there was only one shareholder in each branch, and again the shares were occasionally sold and outsiders brought in. When there was only one shareholder in a branch, it was common for him to have under him \u00e1s\u00e1mis or men who did the actual work of tillage. Though the shareholder might turn him out, the power was seldom used, and the sub-tenant was as a rule well off. The sharer supplied him with a house, cattle, and manure, and advanced him money. He generally paid in kind, and it suited the sharer to use him well as he then had time to take part in village politics and stir up disputes, the chief pleasures of his life.\n\nEvery year the Government demand, \u00e1nkdo, was divided equally among all the branches, and in every branch each shareholder had a lot, ph\u00e1la, assigned to him. If he failed to pay, he forfeited his right to the land, and the other sharers might force him to give it up. But even though he gave up his share and left the village, a shareholder might come back and on paying compensation\n\n---\n\n1 The chief cesses were the plough tax, hal or s\u00e1nth vero; the deficit tax, khot vero; the water tax, p\u00e1t\u00ed vero, generally on newcomers; the arms cess, dh\u00e1rdla vero, on turbulent and warlike classes; the carcase tax, p\u00f3t vero, paid by tanners for dead animals; the leave tax, raja vero, for right to cut crops; the K\u00e1th\u00eds tax or k\u00e1thi p\u00e1l vero, at first a contribution to buy off the K\u00e1th\u00eds, afterwards made part of the Government revenue; a tail tax, puchhi vero, on bullocks and buffaloes; a trade tax, kasab vero. (Mr. Williamson, Bom. Gov. Litho. Papers, 149, 17.) In some places each person paid his own tax; in others, the headman of a class paid the whole class assessment and settled how much each family should give.\n\n2 Captain Robertson, Kaira Rev. Outward Book, 1821.\nclaim his land. The responsibility for other sharers was not always enforced.\\(^1\\) Sometimes the loss in lapsed, *parela*, shares was so heavy, that the solvent sharers were unable to meet it. In such cases the lapsed share was managed by Government.\\(^2\\) When, as often happened, the shares did not include the whole village arable land, the balance called the undivided, *majmun*, land was managed for Government by the headman, *bh\u00e1g\u00e1d\u00e1r*. Except when they bought one of the shares, strangers almost never cultivated in a sharehold village. The whole village site was parcelled among the shareholders, and no new comer could find a house.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe two other forms of village management were only occasionally resorted to. The first called *ij\u00e1ra* or farm, was to let the village to any stranger willing to agree to higher terms than those offered by the village headman. The other called direct, literally detailed or *kacha* management, was to keep the management in the hands of Government officers; the headman or some one else chosen by Government settling with the cultivators and collecting their rents without any avowed profit or any responsibility for the amount. Farming and direct management could be introduced both in simple and in sharehold villages. In a simple village managed by Government direct, the settlement was with the cultivators. If it was farmed, the farmer took the place of Government. In a sharehold village managed direct, Government set aside the *bh\u00e1g\u00e1d\u00e1r* or headman and collected from each *p\u00e1tid\u00e1r* or sharer, leaving him to settle with his sub-tenants. If a joint village was farmed, the farmer might either settle with the headman or manage the village direct. In either case his sole source of profit was the undivided or *majmun* land, the rest being in effect already farmed to the sharers.\\(^4\\)\n\nEach year generally in January when the crops were well advanced, the revenue farmers and the district revenue officers, from the state of the crops and the amount paid in the former year, fixed the season\u2019s demand. A provision was always made for reductions in the event of disturbances, and when the prospects of the season failed an allowance was given. The amount fixed, the headman was held responsible for its payment and was called on to name a Bh\u00e1t as his security. The headman then arranged with the villagers what each had to pay and took security from them. The assessment, sometimes in money, sometimes in kind, was paid by instalments, the instalments being generally calculated to meet the cultivator\u2019s\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Williamson, Bom. Gov.

II., 483). The shares of a village were for convenience kept as *\u00e1nn\u00e1s* or parts of a rupee. Mr. Williamson gives the example of Sandesar in Petl\u00e1l. This village had seven branches, each with a twelve *\u00e1nn\u00e1* share. To each *\u00e1nn\u00e1* was attached 17 *bigh\u00e1s* 18 *vas\u00e1s*, 15 3 of them Government land, and 2 10 rentfree, or 1505 *bigh\u00e1s* in all. Besides this there were 403 5 *bigh\u00e1s* of undivided land, or a grand total of 1908 5 *bigh\u00e1s*. The Government demand on each of the seven branches was Rs. 1080 or Rs. 90 on each one *\u00e1nn\u00e1* share. \\(90 \\times 84\\) the number of one *\u00e1nn\u00e1* shares, gives Rs. 7560, and this with Rs. 294 from the undivided land, gives a total village payment of Rs. 7854.\u2014Bom.

To reap and again to carry the crop home, the headman had to get the revenue farmer's leave.\\(^2\\)\n\nOn a village, backward in paying its contribution, a fine was levied, or a messenger billeted. The billet, *mohsal*, at the revenue farmer's discretion, represented a daily fine varying from 2s. to \u00a310 (Rs. 1-Rs. 100). A trooper besides his horse's feed was paid one shilling a day, and a footman received his food and one shilling.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe land revenue collecting staff were the manager, *kam\u00e1visdd\u00e1r*, the sub-division superintendent, *des\u00e1i*, the sub-division accountant, *majmud\u00e1r*, the assistant superintendent, *amin patel*, the village headman and accountant, and their securities. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the *kam\u00e1visdd\u00e1r* was sometimes simply a Government agent or manager, seeing that the revenue farmer was not misusing his powers and receiving from him his yearly payment, and in other cases he was both Government agent and revenue farmer. His lease was generally for a term of from five to seven years, and as a source of revenue rather than a means of justice, the civil and criminal management of the district was placed under his charge.\\(^4\\) Of sub-division officers the superintendent or *des\u00e1i* guarded village interests, kept open the channels of justice, saw that the cultivators were not oppressed, looked after village improvements, and where necessary made advances for sowing. On behalf of Government, he superintended the village headmen, supplied all local details likely to help in fixing the revenue, and settled boundary and other village disputes.\n\nUnder British management the *des\u00e1\u00eds* lost almost all their power and position.\\(^5\\) On the other hand, the *majmud\u00e1rs* or sub-division accountants as registrars of district rural statistics, formed a most useful part of the British land revenue system. In 1821 Government wrote that it was their anxious desire to establish or revive this office and maintain it in a state of efficiency.\\(^6\\) The *amin patel*, the *des\u00e1i*'s assistant, inspected the different village accounts and settlements. Though in these offices the son generally succeeded the father, the practice was tolerated rather than admitted as a right. These sub-divisional officers formed a well-to-do class. Besides their village fees, *dastur\u00eds*, most of them had, chiefly by taking land in mortgage, acquired considerable estates. But though known as *zamind\u00e1rs*, they had no claim to the exercise of separate jurisdiction.\\(^7\\)\n\nThe village headmen, *patels*, the medium of intercourse between\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom.

They governed the village, managed its affairs, and settled its disputes. Each village had generally a head family whose members were called patel. But among them were one or two of special capacity, the mat\u00e1d\u00e1rs or signers, who alone had the right to sign the village agreements. The position was hereditary, and though as patels they held no land, most of them were well off, with in some cases estates large enough to raise the owner to the rank of landlord or zamind\u00e1r.\u00b9\n\nThe villagers made them presents of grain, and in return for their services, they received from the manager or revenue farmer a yearly allowance depending on the help they had given and amounting in some cases to as much as \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000).\u00b2 Under the headman was the village accountant, tal\u00e1ti. This office had ceased to be of any consequence. He was little more than the headman's clerk and was paid by a grain allowance from the villagers.\u00b3\n\nThe realization of the revenue was protected by an elaborate system of sureties. Sureties were of two classes, the Bh\u00e1t, and the money-lender, manot\u00edd\u00e1r. The position of the Bh\u00e1t was very important. In unsettled villages the chief, and in settled villages the headman or manager, from their feeling of a Bh\u00e1t's personal sanctity were, by any threat of his to sit starving before them or to wound himself, in almost all cases forced to carry out their agreements. For the further security of Government and to ensure the prompt payment of the revenue, a certain class of usurers became, in return for a premium, manot\u00ed, of twenty-five per cent, sureties to the villagers for the payment of their rent. This custom which had reached its greatest height in Dholka prevailed in all the ceded districts.\n\nIn Colonel Walker's opinion, the Mar\u00e1tha system had the merit of being simple and well calculated to ensure the recovery of the revenue. On the other hand, the demand was uncertain and the system liable to abuse and burdensome to the cultivator, who besides paying high rates had to support his sureties.\n\nSection II.\u20141803-1878.\n\nSince the district came under British rule, its land administration may be roughly divided into three periods: the first from 1803 to 1814, when the revenues of village groups and single villages were farmed to men of capital and village headmen; the second from 1814 to 1862, when details of village management were collected and by degrees landholder's liabilities made simpler, fairer, and more certain; the third since 1862, when the revenue survey system was introduced.\n\nThe first year's (1803) management was successful with receipts slightly in advance of the estimates.\u2074 By preserving the public\n\n\u00b9 Bom.

A force of two hundred men had to be sent against the Mahi Kolis, who refused to pay their tribute, and in the quieter villages distress was caused by money-lenders raking up old debts and trying to recover them under the strict provisions of the English law. During the next eleven years (1805-1815) Colonel Walker's counsel against changing the form of revenue management was carefully followed.\\(^3\\) The district was distributed over new sub-divisions, each a suitable charge for a manager, kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r.\\(^4\\) Villages continued to be farmed, some in groups, chiefly to the hereditary district officers, des\u00e1s and amin patels, and others singly, as a rule to their headmen.\\(^5\\) Except that the practice of requiring securities was gradually given up,\\(^6\\) that the Government supervision was stricter, and that more readiness was shown in hearing complaints and checking abuses, the revenue management remained almost entirely unchanged. One of the first matters that pressed for settlement was the claims of the superior landholders, gir\u00e1s\u00edas. Their way of levying their demands by force caused much uneasiness. In 1808 Mr. Diggle\\(^7\\) described them as of barbarous spirit, referring right to the spear.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Sel., XXXIX, 22. In proof of this he cites the case of Nadi\u00e1d with 10,094 acres of waste arable land and 10,000 acres of illegally alienated land able together at ordinary rates to yield a yearly revenue of \u00a327,128.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bom.

Most of their claims, one of the chief of which was bag money, *kothli gir\u00e1s*, were forms of blackmail. They increased their demands in the most unfair way. Sometimes village headmen arranged with the *gir\u00e1sia* to raise his claim on the village, the headman at first sharing the spoil, but in the end the *gir\u00e1sia* gaining the whole. Mr. Diggle thought that their claims could not be denied, as they would join together and find easy shelter in the woods and ravines near the Mahi. He suggested that instead of being allowed to levy their claims from the villagers, *gir\u00e1s\u00edas* should be paid from the Government treasuries. As Government pensioners, they would, he thought, lose much of their importance.\n\nIn 1811 Mr. Rowles began to act on this proposal. His first task was to get the non-resident *gir\u00e1s\u00edas* of Kapadvanj to agree that their claims should be paid by Government and afterwards the principle was extended to the local claimants. In 1816 Captain Robertson reported that in M\u00e1tar, Mahudha, Nadi\u00e1d, and N\u00e1p\u00e1d, arrangements had been made, and that as settled in 1814-15, the total yearly cost came to \u00a32066 (Rs. 20,660). All further claims were subjected to the strictest scrutiny and very few were brought forward. At the same time that they agreed to be paid their claims from the Government treasuries, the *gir\u00e1s\u00edas* were made to furnish security for good behaviour, bound to help in suppressing gang robberies, and warned that any breach of the peace would entail a forfeiture of their allowance.\n\nBetween 1805 and 1815, chiefly from the spread of tillage, the land revenue rose from \u00a3130,015 to \u00a3182,187 (Rs. 13,00,150-Rs. 18,21,870), the advance on the original rentals amounting in Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r lands to twenty-seven and in Peshwa lands, where former supervision had been laxer, to ninety per cent. From 1812 to 1815 was a time of great prosperity. The K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r and north Gujar\u00e1t famine of 1813 and 1814 raised produce prices nearly threefold, and as there was no failure of crops in Kaira, much wealth poured into the district.\n\nThe fifty years from 1814 to 1863 began with the inquiry into the details of village management and the discovery of much irregularity and fraud. In some of the following years especially in the settlement of 1819, the Government demand was greatly enhanced. Helped by the unusually high value of field produce, the new rates were not at first found oppressive. But with the return of ordinary prices complaints of over-assessment became general. In 1826 and 1827 the rates were lowered, and in spite of a falling market, this relief sufficed till in 1831 and 1832 grain fell to less than half of its average money value. Among the agricultural population distress was most keen and widespread. Great part of the revenue could not be collected, and complaints ceased only after some years.\n\n---\n\n1 East India Papers, III., 726.\n2 Ham.

This increase is traced to three sources, the levelling of assessments, the discovery of hidden revenue, and the spread of tillage.\u2014Bom. Gov. Rec. 149 of 1820, 374.\nof free remissions, large rent reductions, and higher grain prices. From 1838 to 1848 was a fairly prosperous time with moderate rates and steady prices. Then, after some years of cheap grain and general depression, came in 1857 a demand for produce, and this continuing for five years, raised the district to much comfort and wealth. During this time by fixing the rental as far as possible according to the value of the land, by removing cesses, and by granting leases, Government tried to make the land tax fair, simple, and unchanging. Bad seasons, low prices, and the fear of sacrificing revenue prevented these aims from being fully carried out. Still by the steadily growing knowledge of the district and by the constant inquiry and supervision of district officers single cases of over-pressure were corrected, rates were equalized, and the grounds of assessment simplified.\n\nThis period (1814-1863) may be conveniently divided into two sections, before and after 1831 and 1832, years of great agricultural depression. During the first section (1814-1830) the chief event was, in 1817, the addition to the district of the lands of Petl\u0101d, Th\u00e1sra, Bh\u00e1laj, and Kapadvanj. Of these territories Petl\u0101d, now Borsad, was at the time of acquisition, cultivated like a garden, the houses well built and handsome, and the stock of cattle large. But with all this show of wealth Borsad was rack-rented. Seven of its sharehold villages had broken down, and the want of waste land made distress all the keener. In Th\u00e1sra the soil was poor and badly tilled, and the cultivators lazy and unsettled. Kapadvanj was in a wretched disorderly state. From their retreats among the Mahi ravines, Kolis were in the habit of sallying in large bodies and harassing their quieter neighbours. The population was scanty, and the cultivation slovenly. Except Kapadvanj, the villages were little more than temporary hamlets of the most wretched huts. So unsettled was the general feeling, that the Kolis used to cut their crops before they were ripe, and earn a living by carting soap to Broach and cotton to M\u00e1lwa.\n\nAs regards produce prices between 1814 and 1830, the district passed through three terms of about five years each. From 1814 to 1819 a time of cheap grain, then till 1825 high prices, and from 1825 to 1830 a rapid fall, ending with prices lower than they had been since the beginning of the century.\n\nThe chief administrative measures of this period were, in 1814, the establishment of a regular staff of paid village accountants, tal\u0101tis, and between 1820 and 1826 the detailed survey of great part of the district. From being hereditary village officers, the chief or headman's clerks, the village accountants were made paid Government servants and agents. The new accountants were appointed both to\u2014\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. More's report of 1822.\n2 Collector's report, 4th June 1824.

In unsettled villages they collected the dues from the chief's tenants, and except an allowance of twenty per cent left to the chief, made over the revenue to Government. The wisdom of this change was doubtful; the chief's independence in his own village, so carefully respected during the early years of British rule, was at an end, and he suffered at once from a loss of position and of revenue. Complaints were frequent, and it was not found possible to appoint accountants to all their villages. To the settled villages the change would seem to have been well suited. The farming system was attended by loss both to the Government and to the bulk of the cultivators, and by many evils to the higher class of villagers. Government lost because its officers had no knowledge of village resources and little power to prevent the headman alienating or misappropriating them. The bulk of the husbandmen suffered because the headmen, unchecked in distributing the village rental, leaving themselves and their connections free, recovered almost the whole from the lower class of landholders, and though in some ways they profited by the system, the rich villagers suffered greatly by their keen unscrupulous rivalry for headship. At first the change met with much opposition. It greatly reduced the power and position of the native sub-division revenue officers, and to a less degree affected the authority of the village headmen. These two powerful bodies joining roused the religious classes to opposition. But the mass of the villagers approved the measure, and opposition gradually died away. A fresh set of difficulties arose from the failings of the new accountants. Equally exposed to temptation, they were not less dishonest than those whose places they had taken. At the same time the post was unpopular, and the supply of men fit to do the work was so small that the Collector was forced to pass somewhat lightly over their misdemeanours. In spite of these defects the accountants' inquiries supplied\n\n1 No accountants or police patels were introduced into the mehv\u00e1si villages.\u2014East India Papers, III., 684.\n\n2 Headmen alienated lands either by sale or mortgage to members of the religious classes.

Gov. Rev. Rec. 149 of 1820, 380.\n\n4 In the struggles for the post of village manager, every village was filled with parties, wasting their time and money, hanging about those in power. In these rivalries every moral principle and obligation were disregarded. Leagues formed one day and cemented by the most sacred oaths were broken the next, and even assassins were employed to murder rivals who could not otherwise be removed.\u2014Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 149 of 1820, 382, 404.\n\n5 Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec., 149 of 1820, 410, 411.\u2014The opposition was keenest at Nadi\u00e1d. There, under the des\u00e9is influence, the headmen refused to collect the revenues. An assistant collector, Captain Barnewall, was sent to arrange a settlement direct with the cultivators. The result was most satisfactory, opposition was broken down, and much useful information collected.\u2014East India Papers, III., 733. In connection with their opposition to this measure, four of the Nadi\u00e1d Des\u00e9is were in 1814 convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to five years' imprisonment and to a fine of \u00a31000. In 1818 the fine was remitted and the prisoners released.\u2014Kaira Vatan settlement report, 15th February 1865.\nChapter VIII.\nLand Administration.\n1814-1830.\nChanges.\n\nmaterials for the effectual control of village managers. In settling villages on the new system the village expenses were as a rule greatly reduced. The holders of quitrent or rentfree lands under Government grants, were first called on to prove their claims. Except Bh\u00e1ts who in some cases raised objections, holders freely showed their title deeds. In the absence of written proof, a bond witnessed by the heads of the villages was taken declaring the justice of the holder\u2019s claim. The course generally followed in the case of illegally alienated lands was to continue to the nominal grantee the allowance he had been receiving and to recover full assessment from the actual holder. The lands of Rajput or v\u00e1nta shareholders willing to lease them were taken under the direct control of Government. The amount of the lease was paid from the Government treasury and the share was managed like other village lands. In Government lands some progress was made in replacing the many complex and unequal cesses by one general assessment. In each case the amount of the new assessment was fixed by a committee of native revenue officers and village headmen. The points taken into consideration were the rates formerly charged, the rates paid by similar land, the character of the soil, the situation of the village in respect of markets, and the caste and position of the landholder. Except in rare instances, the committee\u2019s rates were confirmed by the Collector and remained in force for terms of five or seven years.\n\nEvery year in each village, about August when the early crops were well advanced, the accountant entered in the village book the area of land under cultivation, showing the cause of any rise or fall, and estimated the current year\u2019s outturn compared with the produce of the year before. The sub-division manager, kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r, tested the accountants\u2019 returns and explanations. In October or November the Collector or his assistant came to the village, and with the chief sub-division revenue officers and the village head man and accountant examined the statements making any remissions or changes that seemed called for. The village rental settled, the next question was, whether the headman should farm the village or simply collect the cultivators\u2019 rents. In many cases even when the cultivators\u2019 payments were fixed, the headman though he had no chance of gain or risk of loss, to keep up his position nominally\n\n---\n\n1 The villagers had been charged what the manager spent in fighting his family quarrels and the cost of feasts in which only some of them shared. Without interfering with necessary charges the total Nadi\u00e1d village expenses were reduced from \u00a32350 to \u00a3586.\u2014Captain Barnewall, 1st August 1816.\n\n2 In 1819, of 431,674 acres of alienated land 158,418 were quitrent, and 75,546 rentfree. The rest was either held on service tenure or paid the full or nearly the full assessment. The details were: M\u00e1tar 71,564 acres, 29,517 quitrent and 13,059 rentfree; Nadi\u00e1d 71,675 acres, 26,224 quitrent, and 14,733 rentfree; Mahudha 70,592 acres, 28,228 quitrent, and 10,478 rent-free; N\u00e1p\u00e1d 14,143 acres, 5880 quitrent, and 2739 rentfree; Bh\u00e1laj 8431 acres, 245 quitrent, and 1140 rentfree; Petl\u00e1d 112,070 acres, 39,994 quitrent, and 21,608 rentfree; and Mehmadahad 13,978 acres, 3426 quitrent, and 2253 rentfree.\u2014Bom.

Where the cultivators' payments were not all fixed, the headman generally became surety for the village rental, either for one season or for a term of years. To cover his risk of loss, some reduction from the original rental was generally made. In return the headman signed a deed, engaging to collect nothing more than the authorized, or customary rates.\\(^1\\) If for any reason the headman was unwilling to become surety, the village was managed in detail or kacha by the Collector, the headman and accountant simply collecting the cultivators' rents.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe management of the first six years (1814-1819) of this period, though successful in bringing to light and putting an end to many abuses, would seem to have erred in unduly raising the Government demand. Marked progress was made in Th\u00e1sra and Kapadvanj, the poorer and less settled of the 1817 additions.\\(^3\\) But the plan adopted of leasing Borsad, Mehmadabad, and the other rich tracts to the highest bidders caused much mischief. In the older lands enhanced rates were introduced. These at first lightened by the very high grain prices in 1819 and 1820, in a few years, proved burdensome and had to be reduced.\\(^4\\)\n\nIn June 1821, Mr. Elphinstone, then Governor of Bombay, visited Kaira. He recorded the following opinions on the state of the district and the general results of British management.\\(^5\\) The appointment of accountants to the villages of chiefs and other large landlords should cease. Those who had been sent should be called back and ten per cent should be added to the chiefs' share in the rental of their estates. Illegal alienations of village lands, though resumed neither by the English nor by the Mar\u00e1tha Governments, had never been held as a reason for reducing village rentals; some cess should be levied on these lands and the holders' title confirmed.\\(^6\\) In Government villages the accountants had gained too much power. Care should be taken to keep them to their own duties and not let them take the place of the village headman. The inquiries of the survey then at work in the district should be limited to showing the real state of the land, preventing hidden cultivation, and settling boundaries. From the complications in the existing land\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Only a few members of the head family had the right to sign this deed. Those who had the right were called matiddars or signers.\n\n\\(^2\\) On the appointment of accountants, many villages, that their real resources might be ascertained, were for a time managed in detail by the Collector, the accountants in sharehold villages taking the rental, not in a lump sum from the managers, but from the sharers.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 12. Within a few years the system of settling with the manager again became general.\u2014Bom. Gov. Litho. Papers, 149, I\u201421, and East India Papers, III., 685.\n\n\\(^3\\) Large grants of land were made, and eight new villages established.\u2014More's Jam\u00e1bandi Report of 1820-21.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Collector (Captain Robertson) in 1819 described the district as on the whole prosperous. The landtax was high, estimated on a basis of one-half of the produce, but there was a very large area of quit and rentfree land. Though there were no men of great wealth, there was no class of landless labourers.\u2014Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec., 149 of 1821, 441. Mr. Elphinstone's account (see the text) bears this out. But in spite of a seeming prosperity, how much the district was overstrained, is shown in several of the survey reports (1820-1826) quoted below. Compare also Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 342; the rates fixed in 1819 pressed so hardly on the maliki villages that the people began to desert.\n\n\\(^5\\) East India Papers, III., 690.\n\n\\(^6\\) East India Papers, III., 693.\nsettlement, the extreme difficulty of determining the actual value of land, and the small chance of improving the cultivator's state, the survey should make no attempt to fix fresh rates of assessment. The farming of villages to strangers, and, though to a much less degree, the leasing of them to village headmen, gave rise to many abuses.\\(^1\\) It was better to deal direct with the cultivators, renewing their liabilities from year to year; for, except in the case of rich sharehold villages, leases were ill-suited to their limited resources. The great increase of revenue under British management\\(^2\\) was chiefly the result not of over-assessment but of indirect causes. Under a steady and kindly rule, husbandmen were free to look after their fields, and their numbers were increased by strangers, soldiers, and others, who in the failure of their former employment had taken to tillage. Many classes paid who formerly escaped payment. The cost of collection was low; fees were few; little or nothing was spent on securities; frauds were checked; and the class of middlemen between the cultivator and Government had disappeared. One or two sections of the district were fully assessed, and half of Petl\u0101d might be over-burdened. But no cultivators were leaving the country, or even moving from village to village. Advances were never and remissions rarely asked for; there were no distrainsts, and seldom a case of imprisonment. It was true that the results of the British rule were not unmixed good. The chiefs and large landholders were weakened and depressed, the district officers and among them the heads of villages were stripped of power and influence, and the men of capital suffered both as traders and money-lenders.\\(^3\\) But against these evils was to be set the rise of the cultivators, the largest, hardest working, and most orderly section of the community. Many of them were still burdened with debt, and on some, the decrees of the civil courts pressed heavily. But on the whole their state was thriving, their houses handsome and well built, their dress neat, and their fields highly tilled. The British Government had freed the country from the dread of foreign foes and had established order. It dealt even justice and had nearly rooted out force and fraud. Considering the difficulties the success was surprising.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe second measure taken to gain greater knowledge of the district was the survey. Its objects were to establish for each village an authentic and permanent record of its lands, dividing them into classes according to their nature and quality. The survey embraced every field, tree, and well, and supplied full details of area, soil, and cost of production. From their village memoirs\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Of the Borsad villages the surveyor Captain Cruikshank says (1821) the system of letting villages by auction to the highest bidders has been found productive of great oppression to the cultivators, of loss to the farmers, and of ultimate decrease in the Government revenue. No single instance has yet been met of a farmer expending money or encouraging agriculture.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., XL., 104.\n\n\\(^2\\) From additions and transfers of land, no statement of this increase is available for the whole district. The figures for the Mahudha sub-division give the following results: 1804, \u00a39374; 1806, \u00a311,983; 1808, \u00a312,145; 1809, \u00a311,501; 1812, \u00a312,809; 1814, \u00a314,867; 1817, \u00a317,004; 1819, \u00a319,244; 1820, \u00a322,230.\n\n\\(^3\\) East India Papers, III., 694.\n\n\\(^4\\) East India Papers, III., 687.\nEuropean officers drew up sub-division accounts, describing the people and their mode of tillage. Maps were prepared, one for each of the largest villages, and for the smaller a group of two or three on the same sheet. They showed the village sites, boundaries, roads, ponds, and the different sorts of land, cultivated, waste, open, and enclosed. Of the practical usefulness of the survey, Sir John Malcolm wrote 'the Collectors, in preparing their yearly reports, should refer particularly to the survey records; they should draw a comparison between the actual state of their districts and their state at the time of the survey; they should show what progress has been made in correcting errors; they should account for any change in the extent or state of cultivation; and notice any increase or decrease in the number of people, houses, and wells. From such data as these more than the amount of revenue can correct opinions of the real state of the country be formed.'\n\nBeginning in 1820 in the M\u00e1tar villages in the north-west, the survey worked east, and taking up the Kapadvanj and Th\u00e1sr\u00e1 sub-divisions, passed through the central districts of Nadi\u00e1d and Mahudha, ending in 1826 at Borsad in the south. The information recorded of the state and management of the surveyed districts may be thus summarized.\n\nIn the sixteen Dholka, now M\u00e1tar, villages surveyed in 1820, of 34,469 arable acres, 23,217 or 67\u00b735 per cent were under tillage. The rental rose steadily from \u00a36129 (Rs. 61,290) in 1818-19 to \u00a36967 (Rs. 69,670) in 1823-24. Though all were measured and treated as Government villages, from seven of them accountants were afterwards withdrawn and their management made over to the owners. Of the remaining villages one was sharehold, and the others simple; the lands of two of them divided on the holding, kh\u00e1t\u00e1bandi, system. The assessment was by crop division and cesses. The survey showed that former measurements had under-estimated the total area by 2302 and the arable area by 4868 acres.\n\nThe eleven Mehmadabad villages surveyed in 1821 were part of the 1817 acquisitions. Of 17,555 arable acres, 11,819 or 67\u00b732 per cent were cultivated, and 5736 waste with among them 1057 acres.\n\n---\n\n1 Of these survey maps Sir John Malcolm says (15th October 1830), 'they are extremely well executed and afford gratifying evidence of the aptitude of natives under careful instruction to acquire scientific knowledge. Except the colouring most of these plans are the work of their hands. Perfectly at home in the use of the theodolite and other survey instruments, natives on trifling salaries have of recent years performed all the measurements and other field work formerly solely entrusted to European officers. By this means the yearly cost of the survey was reduced from nearly \u00a310,000 to less than \u00a3600.' 'The maps were very neat,' says Bishop Heber who saw them in 1825 (March 25), 'and said to be wonderfully correct though the mapping, measurement, angles, and drawings were the work of native assistants.'\n\n2 Heb. Nar., II, 140.\n\n3 Minute of 15th October 1830, para. 35.\n\n4 Bom. Gov.

All the eleven villages were simple, the lands of three of them distributed among separate holdings. Except from rice fields, where the produce was divided, the land revenue was raised by acre rates. During the first four years of British management (1818-1821) these villages were leased to the highest bidder. Though they strained the village resources to the utmost, every one of the farmers lost heavily. In 1823 the villages were taken under the direct management of the Collector, and the rates lowered. Still over-assessed and requiring relief, they were (1826) slowly recovering. Mehmadabad was the only first rate village. Of the rest, five were second class, and five extremely poor and wretched, one without a single tiled house. The survey showed that former measurements had under-estimated the total area by 1905, and the arable by 3258 acres.\n\nIn the thirty-three Daskroi, now Mehmadabad, villages surveyed between 1820 and 1823, of 49,898 arable acres, 31,154 or 62.43 per cent were under tillage. The rental rising from \u00a38153 (Rs. 81,530) in 1818-19 to \u00a39143 (Rs. 91,430) in 1822-23, was then lowered to \u00a37486 (Rs. 74,860). A few of the villages were sharehold, the rest were simple, most of them held on lease by their headmen. Rice fields paid in kind; other lands by an acre rate and cesses. Except on some rice lands, the assessment was moderate and likely to promote prosperity; the villages were well built and thriving, and the people happy and contented.\n\nOf the forty-five Nadiad villages surveyed between 1821 and 1824, thirty-six were Government and nine alienated. In the thirty-six Government villages, of 88,083 arable acres, 78,962 or 89.64 per cent were under tillage. The rental rising from \u00a324,419 (Rs. 2,44,190) in 1817-18 to \u00a328,652 (Rs. 2,86,520) in 1820, was in 1822 lowered to \u00a327,742 (Rs. 2,77,420). Of the thirty-six villages, sixteen were sharehold, the rest simple, the lands of several of them distributed into holdings. Except a little crop-division, the assessment was levied by acre rates and cesses. The very high rates on Government land were lightened by the large area held rentfree or on quitrents. The alienated villages, though of the turbulent or mehwasi class were quiet and tractable, 'steadily practising agriculture.' In other parts the lands were rich, tilled with much care and skill, and the villages large and fine, with full and complete establishments. The survey showed that former measurements had under-estimated the total area by 482, and the arable by 11,027 acres.\n\nThe sixteen Umreth and Bhala, now Anand, villages surveyed in 1824, came under British management in 1817. Of 15,426 arable acres, 12,428 or 80.56 per cent were under tillage. The rental \u00a36420\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel., XI., 57-65.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel., XI., 129-140.\n3 Bom. Gov.

Though with high rates Umreth and Bh\u00e1laj were thriving towns, and except some poor and water-lacking hamlets, the villages were little inferior to those of Nadi\u00e1d.\n\nThe eighty-eight Petl\u00e1i, now Borsad, villages surveyed in 1824, came under British rule in 1817. Of the whole number, eleven were alienated. In the rest cultivation had nearly reached its utmost limit. Of 132,397 arable acres, 101,637 or 76\u00b776 per cent were under tillage. The rental was reduced from \u00a343,457 (Rs. 4,34,570) in 1819 to \u00a338,530 (Rs. 3,85,300) in 1824. Of the Government villages, thirty-three were sharehold, and the rest simple, the lands of eleven of them divided into holdings. The demand from cesses and high acre-rates was both heavy and unequal. Complaints of the oppression practised by the speculators to whom the villages had been farmed in 1817 were very general. Under the strain, many of the sharehold villages had broken, and, though much had been done by later (1823 and 1824) settlements, it was very difficult to restore them. Still the villages were large and well built, and many of the people thriving and well-to-do.\n\nThe eighteen N\u00e1p\u00e1d, now Borsad, villages surveyed in 1826, came under British rule in 1817. Of the whole number five and a half were alienated. In the Government villages, of 16,647 arable acres, 14,999 or 90\u00b710 per cent were under tillage. The rental had fallen steadily from \u00a35328 (Rs. 53,280) in 1821 to \u00a34875 (Rs. 48,750) in 1826. Seven villages were sharehold, and the rest simple, the lands of one of them distributed in separate holdings. Though, as in Petl\u00e1i, they had suffered during the first years of British rule, the people were on the whole well-to-do.\n\nThe following statement contrasts the tillage area, resources, and revenue of the different parts of the district surveyed between 1820 and 1826.\n\nKaira Survey Details, 1820-1826.\n\n| No. | Sub-division | Vill. | Per cent of arable land tilled | Houses | Souls | Horned cattle | Ploughs | Carts | Revenue in \u00a3 |\n|-----|--------------|-------|-------------------------------|--------|-------|---------------|--------|------|-------------|\n| 1   | M\u00e1tar (Dholka) | 16    | 67\u00b735                         | 63     | 215   | 132           | 29     | 8    | 102         |\n| 2   | Mehm\u00e1dabad    | 11    | 67\u00b732                         | 62     | 257   | 107           | 20     | 6    | 99          |\n| 3   | Do.

'I asked the Collector Mr. Williamson if the Government were popular. He did not think it was particularly otherwise and ascribed the various tumults and risings of the Gujaratis to their famines which frequently reduced whole families and villages to the state of broken men, and to their long previous habits of misrule and anarchy, rather than to any political grievance. The valuation of the land was moderate. It was only from year to year. But where the crops were so precarious, a longer settlement was not desired by the people themselves. Even in the present system, Government had often to make great abatements and on most occasions had shown themselves indulgent masters.'\\(^2\\) In 1826 a fall of produce prices set in and rapidly increased till the collapse of 1831. In 1826 Kapadvanj is described as in a wretched state, the people badly housed, badly clothed, and badly fed. Mahudha, one of the richest parts of the district, showed signs of distress.\\(^3\\) To meet these difficulties rates were considerably lowered, and by postponing the dates of revenue instalments further relief was given.\\(^4\\) In the next year (1827) after a further reduction of rates all complaints ceased.\\(^5\\) A good season followed, and, though 1828-29 was a year of poor harvest and low prices, no further reductions were necessary.\\(^6\\) During these years, besides by lowering his rents much was done to improve the cultivator's position by granting holdings at fixed rates and leases. Sharehold villages were increased by fifty-nine, many new holdings, kh\u00e1t\u00e1s, were formed, and a large number of short-leased village leases granted.\\(^7\\) In 1830 the district was visited by Sir John Malcolm, then Governor of Bombay. His route by Nadi\u00e1d, M\u00e1tar, and Dholka, led him through great part of the district 'for its extent one of the finest in India.'\\(^8\\) The beauty and fertility of the country, the size and prosperous appearance of the villages, the enclosed fields a succession of rich and varied tillage, the sleek cattle and well-clothed people all seemed thriving and contented. More than any part of the Presidency, the revenue system showed the good points of a direct settlement, with few of its defects.

Many villages were held on leases of seven years and under. The village headmen through whom the settlements were almost always made, were bound to levy nothing beyond the established rates. Though seldom wealthy, they generally possessed considerable credit and means, and were said, by remissions and advances, to help the cultivators. Compared with the Deccan, the Kaira system had the great advantage, that the village settlements were made by the Collector or his assistant in person. Many cultivators were present and any change in assessment was directly discussed. In Sir John Malcolm's opinion, as far as possible, things should be kept as they were. At the same time, much mischief had, he thought, been done by subjecting alienated land to assessment. Besides giving rise to misery and ill-feeling, the measure had added greatly to village payments. From the fall in the value of field produce, rents were hard to collect, and though not prepared to advise a general reduction, Sir John Malcolm felt that the rates were high, and ought in some cases to be lowered. The cultivator's condition should, he wrote, never be lost sight of. For a time they may go on paying a high rent, but the strain must gradually impoverish them, and in the end will cause a sudden, large, and inevitable defalcation in the public revenue.\n\nThe end was not far off. In the next year (1831) the cultivating classes were crushed by a further fall of thirty per cent in produce prices. Tobacco, the chief rent-paying crop, was a drug in the market and the failure to pay the revenue was so general, that in 1831 the Collector was inclined to question the wisdom of the revenue system, only a year before so highly praised. The crisis had shown how little the bulk of the cultivators were removed from poverty. With the object of raising a class of well-to-do landholders, the Collector proposed that the village shareholders should be made more independent, village accountants withdrawn, the Government demand lessened, and the sub-tenants left in the shareholders' hands. Next year things were worse. The revenue fell from \u00a3193,407 to \u00a3176,404 (Rs. 19,34,070 - Rs. 17,64,040), and the year closed with an outstanding balance of \u00a370,818 (Rs. 7,08,180), of which \u00a350,818 (Rs. 5,08,180) were for the past and \u00a320,000 (Rs. 2,00,000) on account of previous years. Distraints for debt were common, and in the Collector's opinion poverty was undermining the district resources. Remissions were freely granted, rents lowered by about \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000), and though one of\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Litho. Papers, 148, I.\n2 Jam\u00e1bandi Report of 1830-31. The reality of the distress has been questioned. (Bom. Gov. Sl., CXIV., 159). But the following extracts shew how severe it was. Poverty is present in every class of cultivators to an extent that tends to impair the efficiency of the revenue system of management and undermine extensively the resources of the state. In spite of the steady reduction of burdens in the last ten years, the bad state has grown worse.\u2014Mr. Mills, 259, 24th August 1832. Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 482 of 1833, 79. All cultivators are encumbered with debts, and the working of the civil courts is attended with much hardship.\u2014Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 482 of 1833, 79, 93.\nthem (1833-34) was a year of much local scarcity, the fourfold rise of prices in 1834 and 1835 relieved the bulk of the cultivators from their most pressing difficulties.\\(^1\\) The next seasons, with fair crops and high prices, reduced the outstanding balances from \u00a370,000 to \u00a330,000. But the fact that of 308 villages whose leases then fell in, a hundred were stationary, 132 worse, and only seventy-six better, shows through how severe a trial the district had passed.\\(^2\\) Next year (1838-39) the crops were poor. But with rising prices outstandings were smaller, billets, *mohsals*, were reduced from 4416 in 1835 to 847, and the revenue realized without distrainments or sales.\\(^3\\) During these years (1830-1840) the district benefited much by the drainage of the lowlands in its southern and western villages. Between 1838 and 1844 measures were taken to remove the plough and other minor cesses,\\(^4\\) to introduce acre rates and individual holdings in parts of the district where the old crop division system still prevailed, and to offer leases to individual landholders.\\(^5\\) The Kaira plough, *hal*, cess was a tax on ploughs only in name. It was really a charge levied chiefly on rentfree and quitrent lands. The Collector did not abolish it, but in some cases transferred the amount as a charge on rentfree lands, and in others added it to the assessment on full rent paying fields.\\(^6\\) 1839 was a season of high prices. The revised acre rates, fixed by village committees on a consideration of the character of the soil and of the position of the holder, differed from the acre rates introduced in 1814-1819 by including the amounts due on minor cesses.\\(^7\\) The number of separate holdings was, as far as possible, increased. Of these some paid only when tilled, in others no provision was made for fallows. At the same time, leases for a term of years were granted to all substantial landholders who wished to have them. These measures do not seem to have been altogether successful. In most of the next fifteen years (1841-1855) large remissions had to be granted, and few seasons closed without a considerable balance of unrealized revenue.\\(^8\\) The leases, fixed at too high a rental, impoverished the holders, and by the need for remissions caused loss to Government.\\(^9\\) When they fell in, they\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Millet, *bajri*, prices rose from 120 pounds the rupee in 1832 to 30 in 1834 and 35 in 1835. 1834 was a season of 'extraordinary difficulty.'

The additions made on the abolition of the plough cess unduly raised the rates on many holdings.\\(^1\\) And though none of the sharehold villages broke under the strain, their rentals in some cases were greater than they could well bear.\\(^2\\) The difficulty found in paying the rates was probably chiefly due to the fall of produce prices from \\(46\\frac{1}{2}\\) pounds in the ten years ending 1842 to sixty-eight pounds in the thirteen years ending 1855.\n\nOf the state of the district in 1854 and 1855, the Collector, Mr. Elphinston, has left a detailed account.\\(^3\\) In 1854 there were, besides five towns with a population of over ten thousand souls,\\(^4\\) 569 villages varying from 500 to 2000 inhabitants. There were also, chiefly in Th\u00e1sra and Kapadvanj, 446 hamlets with from twenty-five to a hundred houses and from 100 to 300 inhabitants.\\(^5\\) Most of the houses were tiled. Only the poorest and lowest classes lived in thatched huts. Of the 574 villages and towns, twenty-seven were wholly alienated, forty partly alienated, and 507 belonged to Government. The lands of the alienated villages, except in a few where produce division still prevailed, were, by their Rajput, Koli, and Musalm\u00e1n owners, let on money rents. The quiet of many years had done much to better their state. But, though among the owners some were improving their lands, they were as a class indebted, and especially the husb\u00e1tis, lazy and unthrifty. Such of them as were free from debt were said to treat their tenants well, taking the revenue in kind, allowing delay and irregularity in the payment of rent, and needing no Government help to recover their dues. The thirty-eight mehdasi villages were held by Rajput and Koli chiefs. Though as a rule moderate, in some cases the Government share nearly swallowed up the entire village revenue. Their lands rich and capable of improvement were in a declining state. The holders were illiterate, lazy, fond of opium, careless, extravagant, and sunk in debt. The affairs of most of them were in the hands of V\u00e1nia stewards more alive to their own than to their master\u2019s interests.\n\nOf a total of 452,209 acres of Government land yielding a rental of \u00a3144,431 (Rs. 14,44,310), 77,933 acres paying \u00a340,537 (Rs. 4,05,370), or more than one-sixth of the area and one-fourth of the rental, were included in sharehold, narva, villages. Though some were overtaxed, no case had for years occurred of a sharehold community breaking under the weight of the Government demand. Many of the sharers did not work with their own hands. Others let out part of their share, tilling the richest fields by the help of relations and servants. Their position was better than that of other cultivators. An alliance with their families was much sought after,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 52 of 1856, 115\u2014117.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 52 of 1856, 126.\n\n\\(^3\\) Bom. Gov. Rev.

Freer than other cultivators from the risk of an enhanced rental, they spent much capital and labour on their land.\\(^1\\) Still their condition was not satisfactory. Expensive in their style of living, many had mortgaged or sold part of their shares, and from the remainder were ill able to meet the heavy Government rent. The shareholders\u2019 lands were let to men of two classes, hereditary tenants and tenants-at-will. The hereditary tenants, chiefly of the sharehold or p\u0101\u1e6d\u012b\u1e0d\u0101r class, held securely and for the most part at fixed rates; the tenants-at-will had no rights. At the landlord\u2019s pleasure their rents might be raised, or their fields taken from them. Both paid at rates considerably above the Government assessment. But complaints of rack-renting or harshness were rare. Frugal in their life, some threw better and were further from want than the shareholders. But in 1854, chiefly from the fall in the value of rich crops, on most their rents pressed hard. Less well-to-do than formerly, they had in many cases to borrow to meet the cost of tillage, and when court decrees were executed against them, little property was generally found.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn simple villages, though quit or rentfree lands had from twenty to twenty-five per cent less waste, they were inferior to full rent lands in cultivation.\\(^3\\) The original share, v\u0101nta, and religious, pas\u0101ita, lands were, except those held by village servants, as a rule minutely divided and sold or mortgaged. Lands alienated by village managers paid rates varying from a few pence the acre to the full Government assessment.\\(^4\\)\n\nIn the Government lands of simple, senja, villages, the lease system introduced between 1838 and 1844 had been almost entirely given up.\\(^5\\) The lands were partly held from year to year by tenants paying on the area tilled, and partly distributed into allotments, kh\u0101t\u0101s, the holder liable for the same rent, whether or no his whole allotment was cultivated.\\(^6\\) Except in a few villages where the crop-rate, tulv\u0101ri, system was in force, lands were assessed at the old village committee money rates depending on the condition and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Mackay\u2019s statement (Western India, 106) that from uncertainty about their rent they spent nothing in improvements, though to some extent it may have been true of the Broach shareholders, did not apply to the Kaira n\u0101vadd\u0101rs.\n\n\\(^2\\) Mr. Mackay\u2019s statement that shareholders sometimes charged 200\u2014300 per cent in excess of Government rates is said by the Collector not to apply to Kaira.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cultivators were said to get quitrent lands at specially low rates by threatening only to till Government fields.\n\n\\(^4\\) Of v\u0101nta lands 55,434 acres, with an estimated rental of \u00a321,826 paid a yearly sum to Government of \u00a35660 at rents varying from 6d. to 10s. an acre. Of religious, pas\u0101ita, lands, a total area of 66,795 acres yielded an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a325,349. Of this 24,347 acres were held on service tenure, and of the rest, 34,787 were rentfree, and 7658 paid aggregate quitrents of \u00a31685.

Rec., 52 of 1856, 140.\n\n\\(^6\\) Of 200,332 acres of Government lands in simple villages, 2492 were leased, 34,505 included in holdings, 71,246 held on running leases, and 92,089 let out to tenants-at-will.\ncaste of the cultivator as much as on the soil; these rates varied much and were further complicated by being expressed in a variable land measure, the \u00e1sra or estimated bigha. This estimate generally larger, but in some cases smaller than the actual measurements, would seem to have been fixed with reference to the kind of soil as much as the size of field. Tenants with distinct holdings always paid the same rent. But the rents of cultivators who were charged only on the land under tillage varied from year to year. As soon as the rains were over, the village officers drew up a return of the area cropped. This statement, checked by the m\u00e1latd\u00e1r and native district revenue officers, fixed the amount cultivators of this class were liable to pay. When remissions were claimed, the crop was left standing and valued by the m\u00e1latd\u00e1r. The results were examined by the Collector or his assistant, and as a rule the produce was equally divided between Government and the cultivator. On the whole, the assessment was moderate, averaging over the entire cultivated area an acre rate of from 5s. to 6s. (Rs. 2\u00bd-Rs. 3 a bigha). But in some villages the want of any abatement of rental on account of fallows, the levy of cesses in addition to the assessment, and family rivalry for the possession of land, had unduly raised the Government share. Added to this, a double currency, their rents paid in Government and the price of their produce realized in Baroda rupees, caused a loss to the cultivators of sixteen per cent.\n\nThe great body of the cultivators were in a depressed state. The cheapness of grain left from ordinary dry crop tillage little margin of profit, and the demand for tobacco, in former years the chief rent-paying crop, had greatly fallen. In most villages the p\u00e1tid\u00e1rs or leading members of the village community were men of substance. Of the Kanbis, a few of good credit and thrifty habits had some store of money. But most of the Kanbis and almost all Kolis and Musalm\u00e1ns were badly off. Their stock of field tools was scanty, and they had either no bullocks at all or only one.\n\n1 In 1865 the survey officers found in Nadi\u00e1d, soil nearly identical in value charged at rates varying from \u00a31 9s. 5\u00bdd. to 1s. 9d.\u2014Bom.

Rec., 52 of 1856, 119.\n4 Rivalry in some cases raised rates to \u00a33 16s. an acre (Rs. 19 a bigha).\n5 Mr. Mackay thus describes the effects of the very low prices of grain: The 30th April (1851) is at hand, the day on which the last instalment is due. The cultivators are at a loss to know how to meet the demand. Their crops have been abundant, but they have no market, and the surplus left in the district makes prices unusually low. (Mackay\u2019s Western India, 31).\n6 Most of the Kanbis were reduced to poverty by the great sums of money they spent to marry their daughters into high families. Mr. Mackay (1850) goes even further: \u201cthe mass of the cultivators are so poor that they hire not only bullocks but tools.\u201d Western India, 120. The surplus of the Kolis\u2019 fields generally went to the money lender; their store gone before the end of the cold season, during the hot season they lived on fruits and wild vegetables. The Musalm\u00e1n cultivators were as a class sunk in debt.\nIn the Collector's opinion (1854) the state of the district called for early remedies. The extra cesses should, he thought, be taken off, the Baroda currency withdrawn, and export dues removed so as to encourage the growth of cotton\\(^1\\) and provide a market for the produce of the district.\n\nDuring the next ten years (1855-1864) the marked rise of produce prices greatly improved the condition of the cultivating classes.\\(^2\\) The two chief changes of this time were, the making of a railway to Bombay (1860-1864), and in 1862 the introduction of a fresh survey. To this survey besides the remeasurement and reclassification of lands, was entrusted the work of fixing fresh rates of assessment. During the five years (1863-1867) of survey operations,\\(^3\\) the great rise of prices due to the American War,\\(^4\\) the opening of the line of railway to Bombay (1864), and, except 1864, a succession of good harvests\\(^5\\) raised the bulk of the Kaira peasantry to a very high level of wealth and prosperity. Except in the north and north-east, where there was a considerable area of poor untilled land, and in a few villages in the rough tracts near the Mahi, the whole district was under cultivation. The country was rich and highly tilled and the villages well built with every sign of plenty and comfort,\\(^6\\) the land revenue was realized without difficulty, and remissions were nominal.\\(^7\\)\n\nThe Maliki villages (1863) of the Th\u00e1sra sub-division, formerly the poorest and least settled part of the district, showed a marked advance in prosperity. By the establishment of fresh hamlets, their number had risen from seventeen in 1821 to twenty-seven; the population was 277 to the square mile; tillage had chiefly in the five years ending 1863 spread thirty-four per cent, and the average remissions were only half a per cent.

Their rents had remained unchanged for years, and with special opportunities for taking advantage of the great rise in produce prices, they would seem to have become the richest villages in the district.\\(^2\\) The sharers were the most thriving class of cultivators, many of them tilling their fields entirely by hired labour.\\(^3\\) Both their permanent tenants and their tenants-at-will were well-to-do.\n\nThe condition of the cultivators of simple villages, except a poor unthrifty class in Th\u00e1sra and Kapadvanj, was excellent. In M\u00e1ter (1862) the people were generally extremely well off, comfortably clothed, and well-housed. The Kanbis were as a class very wealthy, and many of the Kolis, nearly as skilful and hard working as Kanbis, had good houses and large agricultural stock.\\(^4\\) In Mahudha (1863) the Kanbis and Talabda Kolis were \u2018substantial farmers, fast gathering wealth.\u2019 But the Musalm\u00e1ns as a class were unthrifty, and the Chuvalia Kolis in the east were very poor and unsettled.\\(^5\\) In Kapadvanj and Th\u00e1sra (1864), though there was a considerable class of very poor Kolis sunk in debt, who to till their fields had to club their stock and in the hot weather had the barest means of living,\\(^6\\) the main body of the cultivators had large store of money and stock, good houses, and rich clothes and jewels.\\(^7\\) In Nadi\u00e1d (1865) and Borsad (1867) population was beginning to press rather heavily on the land. But only a few were poor or unthrifty, the rest were prosperous and well off.\\(^8\\)\n\nThe limited area of the original survey (1820-1825) and the changes introduced from time to time in the distribution of villages make impossible any complete statement of the development of the district. From the materials available, it would seem that in M\u00e1ter, in seventy of ninety-seven villages, during the forty years ending 1862, cultivation had spread from 37,437 to 43,890 acres or 14\u00b77 per cent; population from 43,271 to 64,182 or about 40 per cent; ploughs from 4859 to 6649 or 26\u00b75 per cent; and wells from 913 to 1030 or 12\u00b78 per cent.\\(^9\\) In fifty-eight of the 103 Mahudha villages, during the forty years ending 1863, cultivation had spread from 41,930 to 49,400 acres or 17 per cent; population from 39,551 to 59,061 or 49 per cent; ploughs from 4749 to 6815 or 43 per cent; and working wells from seventeen to 538 or 133 per cent.\\(^10\\) In the seventy-six Kapadvanj\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom.

In five of the villages, houses had, in the forty years ending 1864, increased from 3428 to 6115 or 78 per cent; people from 13,231 to 16,152 or 22 per cent; draught cattle from 3077 to 4643 or 51 per cent; and ploughs from 356 to 756 or 112 per cent.\\(^2\\) In forty-seven of the seventy-three Government Nadi\u00e1d villages, during the twenty years ending 1865, tillage had spread from 83,599 to 87,868 acres or five per cent.\\(^3\\) In the forty years ending 1864, houses had increased from 16,174 to 26,316 or 62 per cent; people from 62,829 to 81,638 or 29 per cent; cattle from 30,356 to 42,147 or 38 per cent; ploughs from 5298 to 5750 or 7 per cent; and wells from 380 to 518 or 73 per cent.\\(^4\\) In eighty-six Borsad villages, during the twenty-one years ending 1866, tillage had spread from 110,554 to 113,510 or an increase of two per cent.\\(^5\\) In the forty years ending 1866, houses had risen from 20,373 to 35,894 or 27 per cent; people from 80,616 to 101,874 or 20 per cent; cattle from 42,750 to 69,740 or 62 per cent; carts from 3764 to 6029 or 60 per cent; ploughs from 6843 to 6863 or 29 per cent; and wells from 1125 to 1589 or 70 per cent.\\(^6\\)\n\nThe chief changes introduced by the second survey were the fixing of uniform cesses on alienated lands, and, from Government lands the removal of uncertainty in the land measure, of complexity in tenures, and of arbitrary and unfair variations in rates. Thirty of the mehn\u00e1si villages originally held by Koli and Rajput chiefs were left unsurveyed and no change was made in the amount of their yearly payment to Government. The cesses on alienated lands were of three classes, quit, or sal\u00e1mi, rents, occasional, or sav\u00e1dia, rents, and other cesses. The quitrents on alienated lands were of two kinds, fixed and variable. Of fixed quitrents, there were the uhdad sal\u00e1mi or lump assessment on a whole estate generally of v\u00e1nta land; the k\u00e1yam sal\u00e1mi or fixed assessment on a field; and a charge for a written permit to cut crops or chiti\u00faman. Of changing quitrents, there were a cess or sal\u00e1mi, the amount depending either on the area under tillage, the season, or the crop; of occasional cesses or sav\u00e1dia,\\(^7\\) there were two, a personal cess or khedu sav\u00e1dia depending on the caste of the tiller and whether he was a tenant or the holder of the alienated land, and a crop or m\u00e1l\u00ed\u00e1t rate on valuable produce. Of other cesses, the chief were a plough cess, hal or s\u00e1nthi vero, varying from a few annas to thirty\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 692.\n\n\\(^2\\) Bom. Gov.

Under the arrangements adopted for settling these cesses, many of the smaller ones were given up. Of the more important, the fixed quitrent, udhad sal\u00e1mi, was distributed over the different fields of the estate in proportion to the survey assessment of each. The field cess was continued, calculated on the actual and not on the estimated area. The amount of the reaping permit, chiti\u00e1man, cess was laid as a quitrent. The changing quitrents were fixed on the average of twelve years' payments. Among occasional cesses the personal, khedu sav\u00e1dia, was imposed as a permanent quitrent, in proportion to the assessment on the field. In the case of the crop, m\u00e1l\u00ed\u00e1t, cess, the average of twelve years' payment was put on the field, on the condition that if for any reason rich crops could not be grown, the charge should cease. So much of the plough cess as was not absorbed in the new rates was thrown on the quitrent and rentfree fields of the holding.\n\nIn the Government lands, the chief points calling for change were the uncertainty of the land measure, the want of uniformity in the tenures, and the variety in rates. The land measure in use was, as noticed above, the \u00e1sra or estimated bigha, which though generally larger than the regular bigha varied to some extent according to the position and wealth of the landholder. For this the actual measurement was in every case substituted.\n\nAs regards tenures the many varieties were reduced to two simple forms, one of joint responsibility in sharehold, and one of personal responsibility in simple villages. The sharehold, narva, tenure was carefully preserved, but the complications and peculiarities found in almost every village were, as far as possible, removed. The total demand from each village was fixed at the full amount of the survey assessment on its cultivated and waste sharehold lands, together with a quitrent of one-quarter of the survey rate from all land alienated by the village community. According to the wish of\n\n---\n\n1 The plough tax generally rose in proportion to the amount of free and quitrent land.\u2014Bom. Gov.

In other cases on paying one quarter of the full survey rent, the alienee's possession was guaranteed.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 67, 87, 93, 97, 136.\nthe majority, the members were allowed either to keep their former share of responsibility, or to put in its place the amount of the survey assessment on the lands they held. The relations between shareholders and tenants were, as far as possible, unchanged. The rights of permanent tenants were carefully recorded and strictly upheld, but beyond what they could claim under their leases, tenants-at-will received few privileges. As under former arrangements, sharehold villages were charged higher rents than simple villages, the new system in most cases reduced the amount they were called on to pay. In simple villages the chief object of the survey was to introduce one form of tenure and one set of rates. The different varieties of holdings were reduced to the guarantee of possession for thirty years, subject to the payment of rental.\n\nAs to assessment rates, the object was, as far as possible, to fix them solely on the value of the land. But as former rates depended almost as much on the character of the holder as on the character of the soil, the new system would have had the effect of greatly raising the rents of Koli, Musalm\u00e1n, and other unthrifty husbandmen. It was in most cases possible on other grounds to lower the rates charged to men of this class. But to prevent hardship, the rule was made that the rise should not in any case be more than fifty per cent.\n\nThe financial result of the survey was, as shown in the following tabular statement, an increase over the whole district of 11-25 per cent in the Government land revenue.\n\n**Survey Financial Statement, 1863 to 1867.**\n\n| Sub-division | Year of settlement | Ten years' average collections | Collections of the year before settlement | Year of Settlement |\n|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|              |                   |                               |                                          | Old System        |\n|              |                   |                               |                                          | Rate per acre     |\n|              |                   |                               |                                          | Total collections | Rate per acre     |\n|              |                   |                               |                                          |                  |                  |\n| Mahudha      | 1862-63           | 1,70,204                      | 8                                       | Rs. a. p.        | Rs. a. p.        |\n| M\u00e1ter        | 1861-63           | 1,74,055                      | 9                                       | Rs. a. p.        | Rs. a. p.        |\n| N\u00e1di\u00e1d       | 1865-66           | 2,15,100                      | 10                                      | Rs. a. p.        | Rs. a. p.        |\n| Borsad       | 1863-64           | 3,10,100                      | 11                                      | Rs. a. p.        | Rs. a. p.        |\n| Kop\u00e1venj     | 1863-64           | 64,742                        | 8                                       | Rs. a. p.        | Rs. a. p.        |\n| Th\u00e1sra       | 1863-64           | 1,33,411                      | 5                                       | Rs. a. p.        | Rs. a. p.        |\n| Total        |                   | 10,78,621                     | 15                                      | Rs. a. p.        | Rs. a. p.        |\n\nThe A'hand and Mohamadabad sub-divisions were formed in 1869 and Mahudha absorbed.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom.

They are thus summarized by Mr. Pedder: Old holdings with over assessed, vehta, land and lands nominally quit or rentfree; holdings including quit and rentfree lands assessed under Reg. XVII. of 1827 IV. 4; holdings first put together by British Collectors in which quit and rentfree lands paid indirectly by the special rates on the other land; and holdings made up by Collectors with no quit or rentfree lands the total demand being nominally levied according to the value of the estate.\u2014Bom. Gov. Sel., CXIV., 525.\n5 On fields in almost every respect similar, rates varied in M\u00e1ter from Rs. 9-14-8 to Rs. 1-10-6, and in N\u00e1di\u00e1d from Rs. 14-11-7 to Rs. 0-13-10.\u2014Bom. Gov.

The class for whom this measure was most required were the superior landholders whose estates, excluded from the revenue survey, were continued to them on the payment of a lump, u\u1e0dhad, assessment. These men almost entirely representatives of the unruly Rajput and Koli Mahichiefs, partly from their careless and unthrifty management, and partly from the practice of subdividing family estates, had as a class become hopelessly indebted. Up to November 1878 the provisions of the Act had been applied to thirty-three estates. A sum of \u00a33471 (Rs. 34,710) had been advanced by Government and debts amounting to \u00a35446 (Rs. 54,460) were compromised.\n\nThe following are the chief details in the history of the last ten seasons. In 1868 scanty rain in June and July was followed by a severe flood in August and an almost complete failure of the late rains. The total fall was thirty-nine inches. Though the harvest was below the average, the rupee price of millet, bajri, the staple food of the people fell from twenty-four to twenty-nine pounds. The area under cultivation rose from 379,956 to 388,284 acres and the land revenue from \u00a3198,624 to \u00a3199,666 (Rs. 19,86,240-Rs. 19,96,660), the year closing with \u00a3809 (Rs. 8090) of remission and an outstanding balance of \u00a3613 (Rs. 6130). In the central and southern villages the condition of the people was good. But in the poorer lands to the north the Kolis were depressed and embarrassed.\n\nIn 1869 the rains did not set in till the end of July, but from then till October they were plentiful and timely with a total fall of thirty-three inches. The harvest especially the rice crop was splendid. This with millet prices as high as twenty pounds the rupee made the season one of great agricultural prosperity. The tillage area rose from 388,284 to 391,817 acres and the land revenue from \u00a3199,666 to \u00a3203,176 (Rs. 19,96,660-Rs. 20,31,760).

These estates comprise an estimated area of 53,866 acres yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a313,707 (Rs. 1,37,070) of which \u00a34353 (Rs. 43,530) are paid to Government.

The condition of all the cultivating classes was good.\n\nIn 1870 the rain was heavy in July, moderate in August, and short in September. On the whole it was sufficient with a total fall of thirty-eight inches. The early harvest was good but the late crops wanted moisture. Millet prices fell to twenty-one pounds the rupee. The tillage area rose from 391,817 to 393,794 acres and the land revenue from \u00a3203,176 to \u00a3203,765 (Rs. 20,31,760 - Rs. 20,37,650), the year closing with \u00a3107 (Rs. 1070) of remission and an outstanding balance of \u00a3529 (Rs. 5290).\n\nIn 1871 the rainfall was ill distributed. Light early rains were followed in August by heavy floods, and the floods by a long stretch of dry weather. The total fall was thirty-three inches. In the north and east the harvest was poor. But in spite of the local failure millet prices went down to twenty-three pounds the rupee. The tillage area fell from 393,794 to 390,458 acres and the land revenue from \u00a3203,765 to \u00a3200,006 (Rs. 20,37,650 - Rs. 20,00,060), the year closing with \u00a3409 (Rs. 4090) of remission and an outstanding balance of \u00a3429 (Rs. 4290). The central districts were prosperous. But the Kolis of Matar, Mehmadabad, and Thasra showed signs of poverty and were throwing up their lands.\n\nIn 1872 the rainfall was timely and sufficient, with a total fall of fifty-eight inches. A frost in January harmed the cold weather crops, but on the whole it was an average harvest. Millet prices went down to thirty pounds the rupee. The tillage area fell from 390,458 to 387,554 acres and the land revenue from \u00a3200,006 to \u00a3198,645 (Rs. 20,00,060 - Rs. 19,86,450). Remissions were granted to the extent of \u00a3443 (Rs. 4430) and the year closed with an outstanding balance of \u00a3239 (Rs. 2390). The depressed state of the Kolis in Thasra and Mehmadabad continued to attract notice.\n\nIn 1873 the rains began early but towards the end failed, with a total fall of twenty-three inches. The early harvest was fair, the late crops poor. Millet prices again fell to thirty-four pounds the rupee. The tillage area was reduced from 387,554 to 378,282 acres and the land revenue from \u00a3198,645 to \u00a3195,750 (Rs. 19,86,450 - Rs. 19,57,500). Remissions were granted to the extent of \u00a3406 (Rs. 4060) and the year closed with an outstanding balance of \u00a3648 (Rs. 6480). Poverty was spreading among the less thrifty peasantry. Money-lenders, partly because of the shortening of the time of limitation in civil suits and partly because of the continued fall in grain prices, crowded the civil courts, keen to recover their outstanding debts.\n\nIn 1874 the rain at first fell freely and timely, but ceased very early with a total fall of twenty-three inches. The early harvest was good, but the late rice and the cold weather crops failed. The fall in prices continued, millet going down to forty-six pounds the rupee.

Commr. to Gov., 6708, 26th December 1870.\n2 Collector's administration report.\n3 Details are given under the head 'Capital' (p. 63-64). In this year 13,105 civil suits were instituted, compared with an average of 11,350 in the three preceding years.\nland revenue from \u00a3195,750 to \u00a3193,299 (Rs. 19,57,500-Rs. 19,32,990), the year closing with \u00a365 (Rs. 650) of remission and an outstanding balance of \u00a35 (Rs. 50). The cheapness of grain and the failure of the later crops added to the troubles of the poorer husbandmen, and even the well-to-do are said to have been scrimped.\n\nIn 1875 the rain was free and timely with a total fall of thirty-six inches. The harvest was one of the best on record and millet prices fell to forty-eight pounds the rupee. The tillage area fell from 368,001 to 363,255 acres and the land revenue from \u00a3193,299 to \u00a3192,434 (Rs. 19,32,990-Rs. 19,24,340), the year closing with \u00a368 (Rs. 680) of remission and an outstanding balance of \u00a393 (Rs. 930). In spite of the slight fall in prices the state of the cultivating classes showed signs of improvement, and the pressure of the money-lenders had to a great extent ceased.\n\nIn 1876 the rain was again favourable with a total fall of thirty inches, and while the local harvest was good, millet prices in consequence of the failure in the Deccan and Southern Maratha districts rose from forty-eight to forty pounds. The tillage area fell from 363,255 to 362,222 acres and the land revenue rose from \u00a3192,434 to \u00a3193,802 (Rs. 19,24,340-Rs. 19,38,020), the year closing with \u00a3122 (Rs. 1220) of remissions and no outstanding balances. Before these large crops and high prices all signs of poverty disappeared, and the people were said to have been exceptionally prosperous.\u00b9\n\nIn 1877 the rains began well, but they soon failed and in spite of heavy September showers the total fall was twenty-six inches. The cold weather harvest was fair, but except those that were watered the early crops suffered. Exports to the famine districts had drained the local stock of grain, and millet prices went up from forty to seventeen pounds. The tillage area rose from 362,222 to 377,438 acres and the land revenue from \u00a3193,802 to \u00a3195,510 (Rs. 19,38,020-Rs. 19,55,100), the year closing with \u00a364 (Rs. 640) of remission and an outstanding balance of \u00a3554 (Rs. 5540). On the whole 1877 was a good year for Kaira cultivators. The poorer classes lost much of their crops. But what they reaped was of very high value and the rise in prices improved their credit. To the better class of cultivators whose wells ensured them a full harvest the season was one of very great profit.\n\nDuring the thirty years ending 1876 population has increased from 566,513 to 782,733 or 38\u00b716 per cent; houses from 150,628 to 218,596 or 45\u00b712 per cent; cattle from 413,440 to 458,439 or 10\u00b788 per cent; ploughs from 54,975 to 56,916 or 3\u00b753 per cent; carts from 20,864 to 29,110 or 39\u00b752 per cent; and wells from 6409 to 9237 or 44\u00b712 per cent. In these years the land revenue has risen from \u00a3152,109 to \u00a3195,443 or 28\u00b748 per cent. Five municipalities, six dispensaries, and 190 schools have been established, and 100 miles of road and seventy-two miles of rail have been opened.\n\n\u00b9 Gov. Res. 4602, 28th June 1876.\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJUSTICE.\n\nThe judicial administration of the lands acquired in 1802 remained in the hands of the Resident at Baroda till in 1805 a Judge and Magistrate was appointed for Kaira.\\(^1\\) In 1818 the office and functions of magistrate were transferred from the Judge to the Collector.\\(^2\\) In the same year, owing to the acquisition of territory under the treaty of the 6th November 1817, the jurisdiction of the Kaira Judge was limited to the lands of the eastern division, and a new Judge was appointed for the western division and stationed at Ahmedabad.\\(^3\\) In 1828 the office of District Judge of Kaira was abolished, and from that time till 1856 the judicial administration of the district remained in the hands of the Judge of Ahmedabad. In 1856 a senior assistant judge was sanctioned for Kaira. This appointment was abolished in 1869, and since that time, except from 1872 to 1874 when a joint Judge was stationed at Kaira, the duties have been performed by the Judge and assistant judge of Ahmedabad.\n\nOf the strength of the staff appointed to decide civil cases in the Kaira district no details have been obtained earlier than the year 1830. In that year the district was furnished with eight judges. The total number of suits disposed of was 5949. Twenty years later in 1850 there were in all seven courts, and the cases disposed of numbered 6189. In 1860 there were again eight courts and the suits numbered 5313. In 1870 the number of courts was reduced to six, while the number of decisions rose to 10,532. In 1874 there were five courts and 10,884 decisions. In 1877 the number of courts was the same, while the total of suits fell to 8853. At present (1878) the district is provided with five subordinate judges' courts with an average jurisdiction over 320 square miles and 156,546 souls. Of these one is stationed at Kaira with jurisdiction over the Mehmadabad and Matar sub-divisions; another at Nadiad with jurisdiction over the Nadiad and some villages of the Anand sub-divisions; a third at Kapadvanj with jurisdiction over the Kapadvanj sub-division, and over some villages of Thasra in Kaira and of Parantij in Ahmedabad; a fourth at Umreth with jurisdiction over some villages of the Thasra, Anand, and Nadiad sub-divisions; and a fifth at Borsad with\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Reg. II. of 1805, sec. V.\n\n\\(^2\\) Reg. III. of 1818.\n\n\\(^3\\) Gov. order dated 9th February 1818.\njurisdiction over the Borsad sub-division and some villages of A'nand. Besides these there is a small cause court at Nadi\u00e1d. The business of this court is conducted by the judge of the small cause court at Ahmedabad who visits Nadi\u00e1d on the first and third Mondays in each month.\n\nThe average distance of the Kaira court from its six furthest villages is seventeen miles; of the Nadi\u00e1d court, fifteen; of the Kapadvanj court, forty-eight; of the Umreth court, thirteen; and of the Borsad court, fourteen. Exclusive of suits settled by the small cause court, the average number of cases decided during the eight years ending 1877 is 11,123. During the first four of those years the totals rose from 10,532 in 1870 to 13,105 in 1873 and then fell to 8853 in 1877. Of the total number of cases decided during the eight years ending 1877, 71\u00b739 per cent have on an average been given against the defendant in his absence. The proportion of cases decided in this way would seem to have been on the increase during the first three years and on the decline during the next five years, the maximum percentage being 79\u00b755 in 1872 compared with 73\u00b778 in 1870 and 59\u00b756 in 1877. Of contested cases only 15\u00b717 per cent have, during this period of eight years, been on an average decided for the defendant. The proportion of such cases decided in favour of the defendant fell from 23\u00b748 per cent in 1870 to 11\u00b719 per cent in 1872, and then during the next five years rose to 17\u00b730 in 1877. In 127 or 1\u00b743 per cent of the whole number of suits decided in 1877, the decree has been executed by putting the plaintiff in the possession of the immoveable property claimed. The number of cases of this kind does not vary much from year to year, except that in 1873 the total was only 47 out of 13,105 suits, and in 1877 was 127 out of 8853. In 1870 the total was 104 compared with 127 in 1877. In 53\u00b738 per cent of the decisions passed in 1877, decrees for money due have been executed by the attachment or sale of property; of these 17\u00b711 per cent have on an average been by the sale of moveable and 36\u00b727 per cent by the sale of immoveable property. Compared with 1870, the 1877 returns of attachments or sales of moveable and immoveable property show a rise from 354 to 1515 in the former, and from 1185 to 3211 in the latter.\n\nCompared with 1870, the number of decrees executed by the arrest of the debtor during the eight years ending 1877 has considerably fallen, the total for 1870 being 1553 against 104 in 1877. As will be seen from the following table, the number of civil prisoners has varied but little during the eight years ending 1877, the total in the latest year being 123 compared with 154 in 1870 and 212 in 1873;\n\n| Year | Suits | Decreed Ex-parte | Percentage |\n|------|-------|------------------|------------|\n| 1870 | 10,532| 7771             | 73\u00b778      |\n| 1871 | 10,526| 7792

will be seen, that during the eight years ending 1877 the total number of suits decided by the Nadiad small cause court, which rose from 1454 in 1870 to 2118 in 1872, has fallen to 1064 in 1877, or a decrease of 26\u00b782 per cent in eight years. Against a fall in suits of less than \u00a320 (Rs. 200) there is a slight rise in suits of higher value. Except in 1871 and 1877 when it rose to \u00a35 18s. 7d. (Rs. 59-4-8), and \u00a35 3s. 9\u00bdd. (Rs. 51-14-4), the average value of suits during the eight years has ranged between \u00a34 6d. (Rs. 40-4) and \u00a34 16s. 8d. (Rs. 48-5-4). As regards the execution of decrees, attachments of property have risen from 16 in 1870 to 64 in 1877; and sales from 4 to 32. There is a fall in the number of debtors imprisoned from 16 in 1870 to 11 in 1877.\nRegistration employs eight special sub-registrars, one at each of the seven sub-division headquarters\u00b9 and the eighth at the town of Umreth. In addition to the Collector's supervision as district Registrar, and to his assistant or deputy's supervision a special scrutiny is, under the control of the Inspector General of registration and stamps, carried on by the inspector of registration for Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nAccording to the registration report for 1877-78 the receipts for that year amounted to \u00a31838 (Rs. 18,380), and the charges to \u00a31001 (Rs. 10,010), leaving a balance of \u00a3837 (Rs. 8370). Of 6466, the total number of registrations, sixty-one were wills, 121 were documents affecting moveable, and 6284 documents affecting immoveable property. Of the last class, in addition to 1073 miscellaneous instruments, thirty were deeds of gift, 2242 were deeds of sale, and 2939 were mortgages. The registered value of the total immoveable property transferred was \u00a3219,388 (Rs. 21,93,880).\n\nAt present (1878) eighteen\u00b2 officers share the administration of criminal justice. Of these five, one of them a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r, are magistrates of the first, and thirteen of the second and third classes. Of the former two are covenanted European civilians and three are natives. With regard to the local jurisdiction and powers of these magistrates, one of them, the District Magistrate, is placed in a special position, invested with a general supervision over the whole district. Each of the four remaining first class magistrates has an average charge of 400 square miles and a population of 195,683 souls.\n\nIn the year 1876, the five first class magistrates decided 286 original and eighty-one appeal criminal cases. Of the five first class magistrates three have as Collector, assistant collector, and deputy collector, revenue charge of the parts of the district in which they exercise magisterial powers. Of subordinate magistrates there are fourteen, all of them natives with an average charge of 114 square miles and a population of 60,210 souls. In 1876 they decided 1228 original criminal cases. Besides their magisterial duties, these officers\n\n\u00b9 The registry office for the Mehmadabad sub-division is held at Mehmadabad from the second Monday to the following Saturday in each month, and during the rest of the time at Kaira.\n\n\u00b2 Besides nine honorary magistrates.\nexercise revenue powers as m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs or the head clerks of m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs. Seventy of the village headmen, of whom there are 600 with an average annual pay of \u00a34 12s. (Rs. 46), have been entrusted with powers of fining and imprisoning, and the rest with the powers contemplated by the Bombay Village Police Act (VIII. of 1867).\n\nFrom the table of offences given below, it will be seen that during the seven years ending 1877, 2250 offences or one offence for every 347 of the population were on an average committed. Of these there were on an average ten murders and attempts to commit murder; five culpable homicides; sixty-one cases of grievous hurt and hurt by dangerous weapons; and twenty-six cases of dacoity and robbery. 2146 or 95 per cent of the whole were minor offences.\n\nAt the beginning of the century when Kaira came under British management, the chief criminal classes were the Rajput Gir\u00e1s\u00edas or land revenue claimants, who to recover some alleged claim, or because of some other grievance would, by turning outlaws, b\u00e1h\u00e1ravati\u00e1s, burning, murdering, and robbing, try to force the authorities to grant their demands. The next class were the Kolis, inveterate robbers and highwaymen. A third were the Bh\u00e1ts or B\u00e1hrots who when pressed to pay taxes committed tr\u00e1ga, that is, either mutilated themselves or killed one of their number. At the 1811-12 circuit sessions the chief offences were gang robberies, housebreaking, and theft, and the passing of base money. The gang robberies were seldom found out. In 1813 on account of the scarcity crime was unusually general. At that time so disturbed was the country that in the western districts long before sunset ploughs were unyoked and wells deserted.\n\nIn 1821 the district was orderly. There was no open violence, murders were rare, and thefts much fewer than formerly. Except the Kolis the people were not given to affrays, drinking or other forms of debauch. A few years later there was a serious disturbance among the Kolis. On the night of the 17th March 1826 Govind\u00e1s R\u00e1mdas with about 500 armed followers attacked the town of Th\u00e1sra with the object of driving out the British officer and establishing himself as ruler. His followers thought Govind\u00e1s a saint and believed him endowed with supernatural powers. In 1828 things were better, there were few cases of large plundering gangs. The population was generally quiet and crimes were few. Two years later (1830) the Kolis were again unsettled. Bands of disaffected vagrants wandered about, orderly cultivators were not protected, few travellers escaped without loss and in Sir John Malcolm\u2019s camp though at a distance from the wilder tracts and guarded by village\n\n---\n\nIn the early years of British rule tr\u00e1ga cases were not uncommon. The following are examples. In 1816 the M\u00e1tar Bh\u00e1ts to prevent Government officers from measuring their lands wounded some of their number.\u2014Ham. Des., I., 692. In 1827 for refusal to pay a quitrent on their lands the Bh\u00e1ts\u2019 crops were attached. At Mahudha an old woman threw herself into a well and at An\u00e1ra two women killed themselves and three men wounded themselves severely.\u2014Collector, 15th December 1827.\n\n1 Ham.

Malcolm's minute 15th October 1830 (Litho. Papers No. 148, 51.)} Though they have to a great extent settled as regular cultivators, the Kolis are still a troublesome class. Many are born and brought up as thieves, and the difficulty of tracing crime is increased by the ready shelter given to criminals in the tract of rough country along the Mahi, and in almost all the states that march with Kaira limits. Besides, of late years small hamlets sometimes as many as twenty to a village have sprung up, and in other parts the lower classes of villagers have begun to live in small huts in the fields. These changes add much to the difficulty of keeping a watch on the criminal classes. Agrarian crimes, thefts from fields in harvest time, the burning of crops to pay off a private grudge, and the murder of oppressive money-lenders\\footnote{Kolis and Rabaris or wandering shepherds, are the classes most given to burning crops. Before burning the crop a warning is generally hung on some tree or near a well, stating that unless the owner of a certain field takes care his crop will be burnt. The following are some of the more recent cases of attacks on money-lenders. In 1872 two Vania brothers of the town of Kaira obtained an order of attachment against the property of a Koli of Parsatej, a village in the Mehmabad sub-division, and while he was busy with his wife's funeral sold all his property. The brothers were warned, but without effect. A few days after they paid another dunning visit to the village, and as they were riding home some of the villagers followed them, dragged them from their horses, and killed them, throwing their bodies into the river. In 1873 a Brahman usurer of Borsad brought to the village of Asodar in the Borsad sub-division a decree against three Koli brothers. On pretence of giving him grass in satisfaction of his claim, the brothers took him to their field and setting upon him killed him. In 1874 two cases occurred. In the first in spite of his entreaties a Vania sold the house and other property of a Koli of Dhalora in the Matar sub-division. In revenge the Koli stabbed him dead. In the second a Vania of Nadiad bought a field from a woman of his village, to whom it had been mortgaged by the holder, a Koli. The Koli refused to give possession. Persisting in having the field planted with rice the Vania with a Brahman friend went to the place to see that the work went on. While there the Koli and some friends came up, attacked the strangers, and killed them both on the spot.} have of late years been rather common.\n\nIn 1872 several cases of poisoning occurred. Suspicions were aroused and on the trial of one of the cases it came out that the poisonings were the work of a gang of professional criminals. The leader was convicted and hanged, and one of his accomplices transported for life. Since then this form of crime is believed to have ceased.\\footnote{In one case at the village of Sui in the Thasra sub-division, as a band of nineteen shepherds were sitting down to their evening meal, a man dressed as a Brahman asked them to bring their flocks next day to manure his fields. The shepherds agreed. On rising to go, the Brahman offered them two sweetmeats, saying they were from the temple of Ranchhodji at Dakor, and as some children had touched his clothes he could not eat them. The shepherds took the sweetmeats, and after the Brahman left divided and ate them. In a short time all sickened. Six died and the rest only recovered after a long illness. Some months after a Musalm\u00e1n packman of Kaira was with two servants going from Dakor to Kaira. Near Umreth they were joined by two Musalmans. After a meal cooked by the strangers, the two servants fell ill. One died during the night, and the other somewhat recovered went on with his master and the strangers to Nadiad. Next day after leaving Nadiad they ate some more of the strangers' food. That night two policemen coming from Kaira to Nadiad found one of them dead and the other apparently mad and their goods gone. The strangers had disappeared. Followed on camels, one of them was found in Baroda with the greater part of the stolen property. The other was afterwards taken in Ahmedabad. At the trial one of them confessed that he had poisoned the Sui shepherds.}\n\nIn the year 1877 the total strength of the district or regular police force was 754. Of these under the district Superintendent one was a subordinate officer, 142 inferior subordinate officers, thirty-five\n\nCost, 1877.\nmounted police, and 575 constables. The cost of maintaining this force was as follows. The one European officer, the district Superintendent, received a total annual salary of \u00a31080 (Rs. 10,800); the subordinate officer, a yearly salary of not less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) and the inferior subordinate officers, yearly salaries of less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) each, or a total yearly cost of \u00a33419 16s. (Rs. 34,198); the pay of the mounted and foot police came to a total of \u00a36676 (Rs. 66,760). Besides the pay of the officers and men, there was a total annual sum of \u00a3366 (Rs. 3660) allowed for the horses and travelling expenses of the superior officers, \u00a3205 2s. (Rs. 2051) annual pay and travelling allowance for their establishments, and \u00a3393 (Rs. 3930) a year for contingencies and other expenses, making a total annual cost to Government for the district police of \u00a312,139 18s. (Rs. 1,21,399).\n\nTaking 1600 square miles as the area of the district and 782,733 as its population, the strength of the police of the Kaira district is one man to every 2:12 square miles and 1038 souls. The cost of maintenance is equal to \u00a37 11s. 9d. (Rs. 75-14) per square mile, or 3\u00bdd. (2\u00bd as.) per head of the population. Of the total strength of 754, inclusive of the Superintendent, twenty-eight officers and twenty-four constables were in 1877 employed as guards at district, central, or subsidiary jails; 109 men, nineteen officers and ninety constables, were engaged as guards over treasuries, lock-ups, or as escorts to prisoners and treasure; 531 men, 110 officers and 421 constables, were engaged on other duties; and eighty-six men, eleven officers and seventy-five constables, were stationed in towns and municipalities. Of the portion of the force on general police duties 137, twenty-four head constables and 113 constables were employed at twenty-seven police posts, th\u00e1n\u00e1s, with on an average about twelve villages to each post. It is the duty of these men to be constantly moving from one to another of the villages under their charge. Of the whole number, exclusive of the district Superintendent, 301 were provided with fire-arms and 452 with swords only, or with swords and batons; 405, ninety-seven officers and 308 constables, could read and write; and 162, twenty-seven officers and 135 constables, were under instruction during the year. With the exception of the European Superintendent, the members of the police force were all natives of India. Of these, seventy-eight officers and 295 constables were Musalm\u00e1ns, four officers and thirteen constables were Br\u00e1hmans, sixteen officers and forty-four constables were Rajputs, eight officers and thirty-four constables were Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, twenty-one officers and 183 constables were Kolis, fourteen officers and forty-one constables were Hindus of other castes, and two officers belonged to other religions.\n\nSubordinate to the district police there is the village watch, who under the names of r\u00e1vani\u00e1s, rakh\u00e1s, and pagis with a total strength of about five for each village and a cost of \u00a313 (Rs. 130), besides as guides and messengers, act as village police. This force of village police is paid chiefly by the grant of land. Besides what they receive from Government the village watch, nominally on the understanding that they will make good any losses by theft, recover from villagers yearly sums varying from \u00a35 to \u00a330 (Rs. 50-Rs. 300).\nKAIRA.\n\nIn 1877 of 261 persons accused of heinous crimes, 181 or 69\u00b735 per cent were convicted. Of 3884, the total number of persons accused of crimes of all sorts, 2420 or 62\u00b731 per cent were convicted. Of \u00a31677 (Rs. 16,770) alleged to have been stolen, \u00a31189 (Rs. 11,890) or 70\u00b786 per cent of the whole amount were recovered.\n\nThe following table gives the chief crime and police details of the seven years ending 1877:\n\n| Year | Murder and attempt to Murder | Culpable Homicide | Grivous hurt and hurt by dangerous weapons | Dacoities and Robberies |\n|------|-----------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|      | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage |\n| 1871 | 20     | 50      | 8           | 16\u00b70      | 2       | 2       | 1          | 50\u00b70      | 70     | 92      | 35        | 39\u00b704     |\n| 1872 | 15     | 40      | 13          | 32\u00b75      | 6       | 4       | 3          | 75\u00b70      | 58     | 100     | 48        | 48\u00b79      |\n| 1873 | 7      | 12      | 10          | 83\u00b733     | 10      | 4       | 4          | 40\u00b70      | 58     | 78      | 49        | 51\u00b728     |\n| 1874 | 9      | 53      | 24          | 45\u00b728     | 14      | 9       | 14         | 64\u00b729     | 64     | 110     | 51        | 46\u00b745     |\n| 1875 | 8      | 30      | 8           | 30\u00b70      | 14      | 2       | 1          | 14\u00b729     | 66     | 77      | 35        | 46\u00b741     |\n| 1876 | 5      | 7       | 6           | 85\u00b771     | 10      | 2       | 2          | 100\u00b70     | 99     | 108     | 51        | 51\u00b751     |\n| 1877 | 12     | 35      | 13          | 37\u00b714     | 4       | 13      | 2          | 15\u00b738     | 75     | 145     | 14        | 94\u00b729     |\n\nOffences and Punishments\u2014continued.\n\n| Year | Other Offences | Total |\n|------|----------------|-------|\n|      | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage |\n| 1871 | 1659   | 4905    | 1907       | 38\u00b767      | 1936   | 5184    | 1874       | 36\u00b747      |\n| 1872 | 2707   | 3602    | 1358       | 38\u00b703      | 3214   | 4097    | 1628       | 39\u00b762      |\n| 1873 | 2707   | 3602    | 1358       | 38\u00b703      | 3214   | 4097    | 1628       | 39\u00b762      |\n| 1874 | 3833   | 3420    | 1499       | 40\u00b705      | 1949   | 3651    | 1598       | 42\u00b712      |\n| 1875 | 2075   | 3887    | 1751       | 45\u00b781      | 2178   | 4081    | 1856       | 46\u00b721      |\n| 1876 | 2141   | 3879    | 1814       | 47\u00b760      | 2236   | 4046    | 1725       | 42\u00b770      |\n| 1877 | 2113   | 3823    | 2239       | 58\u00b779      | 2225   | 3894    | 2420       | 62\u00b790      |\n\nStolen Property.\n\n| Year | Property stolen | Property recovered | Percentage |\n|------|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 1871 | 3921            | 1219               | 31\u00b707      |\n| 1872 | 3858            | 1026               | 27\u00b790      |\n| 1873 | 3858            | 1026               | 27\u00b790      |\n| 1874 | 1453            | 396                | 68\u00b754      |\n| 1875 | 1483            | 1215               | 62\u00b753      |\n| 1876 | 1943            | 1215               | 62\u00b753      |\n| 1877 | 1677            | 1189               | 70\u00b786      |\n\nLittle information of the comparative amount of crime at different periods since the introduction of British rule has been collected. The following is a summary of such details as are available. The total number of offences committed during the five years ending 1849 was 15,757, representing an annual average of 3151, or on the basis of the census returns of 1846, one crime to every 179 inhabitants. Corresponding returns for the five years ending 1877 show a total of 11,250 offences giving a yearly average of 2250 crimes, or on the basis of the 1872 census returns one crime to every 347 inhabitants. A comparison of the returns would seem to show great improvement in the matter of murder and culpable homicide. While population has increased since 1849, only ten cases of murder and attempts to commit murder were on an average returned per year during the five years ending 1877 against twenty-four.\nChapter IX.\nJustice.\n\nCrime and police,\n1845-1849.\n\nduring the five years ending 1849, and five against seven of culpable homicide. Under the head of robberies including dacoities and thefts of cattle, there is a most marked falling off, the yearly averages for the two periods being 830 for the earlier and 131 for the later. Besides these, the crime of arson not now shown as a separate offence was very common. During the five years ending 1849, 871 cases or on an average 174 per year were recorded with an estimated average annual destruction of property worth \u00a3626 8s.

Since that time many changes have been made in the way of keeping accounts. But, as far as possible, the different items have been brought under their corresponding heads of account according to the system at present in force. Exclusive of \u00a377,654 (Rs. 7,76,540) the adjustment on account of alienated land, the total transactions that appear in the district balance sheet for 1875-76 amount to receipts \u00a3291,117 (Rs. 29,11,170) against \u00a3194,251 (Rs. 19,42,510) in 1815-16, and the charges to \u00a3286,154 (Rs. 28,61,540) in 1875-76 against \u00a3165,067 (Rs. 16,50,670) in 1815-16. Exclusive of departmental miscellaneous receipts and sums received in return for services rendered, such as the receipts of the post and telegraph departments, the amount of revenue raised in 1875-76 under all heads, imperial and provincial services, local funds and municipal revenues, amounted to \u00a3260,547 (Rs. 26,05,470), or on a population of 782,733 an incidence per head of 6s. 8\u00bdd. As no census details are available for 1815-16, corresponding information for that year cannot be given.\n\nDuring the interval of sixty years, the following changes have taken place under the chief heads of receipts and charges:\n\nLand revenue receipts, forming 74\u00b71 per cent of \u00a3260,547 (Rs. 26,05,470) the entire revenue of the district, have risen from \u00a3156,344 (Rs. 15,63,440) in 1815-16 to \u00a3195,184 (Rs. 19,51,840) in 1875-76. The increase is for the most part due to receipts from the large additional area under cultivation. Another source of increase has been the larger amounts recovered since 1863 from all alienated lands except service lands held by certain village and district officers. The land revenue charges show an advance from \u00a312,696 to \u00a325,398 (Rs. 1,26,960 - Rs. 2,53,980). This increased cost in collecting the land revenue is partly due to a rise in the number and in the amount of both village and district officers' salaries, and is in part the result of the change from hereditary to stipendiary officers.\n\nThe following statement shows the land revenue collected in each of the forty-five years ending 1877:\n\n---\n\n1 Figures for the years between 1833 and 1862 are taken from statement No. II. in Mr. Bell's excise report dated 1st October 1869. Figures for subsequent years are taken from the annual reports.\nChapter X.\n\nRevenue and Finance.\n\nKaira Land Revenue, 1833-1877.\n\n| Year | Land Revenue | Year | Land Revenue | Year | Land Revenue |\n|------|--------------|------|--------------|------|--------------|\n| 1833-34 | \u00a3118,439 | 1848-49 | \u00a3143,028 | 1863-64 | \u00a3174,058 |\n| 1834-35 | \u00a3104,502 | 1849-50 | \u00a3152,341 | 1864-65 | \u00a3192,065 |\n| 1835-36 | \u00a3196,505 | 1850-51 | \u00a3151,145 | 1865-66 | \u00a3190,127 |\n| 1836-37 | \u00a3153,105 | 1851-52 | \u00a3154,713 | 1866-67 | \u00a3191,384 |\n| 1837-38 | \u00a3155,865 | 1852-53 | \u00a3157,187 | 1867-68 | \u00a3198,624 |\n| 1838-39 | \u00a3149,814 | 1853-54 | \u00a3147,652 | 1868-69 | \u00a3199,666 |\n| 1839-40 | \u00a3147,985 | 1854-55 | \u00a3152,470 | 1869-70 | \u00a3203,176 |\n| 1840-41 | \u00a3149,042 | 1855-56 | \u00a3151,388 | 1870-71 | \u00a3203,765 |\n| 1841-42 | \u00a3152,426 | 1856-57 | \u00a3153,175 | 1871-72 | \u00a3200,006 |\n| 1842-43 | \u00a3152,544 | 1857-58 | \u00a3154,035 | 1872-73 | \u00a3198,645 |\n| 1843-44 | \u00a3152,109 | 1858-59 | \u00a3155,909 | 1873-74 | \u00a3195,750 |\n| 1844-45 | \u00a3154,989 | 1859-60 | \u00a3158,086 | 1874-75 | \u00a3194,100 |\n| 1845-46 | \u00a3150,661 | 1860-61 | \u00a3166,632 | 1875-76 | \u00a3192,312 |\n| 1846-47 | \u00a3153,135 | 1861-62 | \u00a3163,147 | 1876-77 | \u00a3193,738 |\n| 1847-48 | \u00a3153,995 | 1862-63 | \u00a3160,564 | 1877-78 | \u00a3195,443 |\n\nTribute.\n\nThere is no separate head of Tribute. The sum of \u00a32547 10s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 25,475-5-1) paid yearly as cash tribute by the Naw\u00e1b of Cambay under the treaty of Bassein (1802) and the Imperial share of certain cesses are credited to Land Revenue.\n\nStamp receipts have risen from \u00a32296 to \u00a320,471 (Rs. 22,960-Rs. 2,04,710); the expenditure of \u00a3574 (Rs. 5740) is a new charge.\n\nExcise.\n\nUnlike the southern districts of Gujar\u00e1t, liquor is little used. Excise receipts have risen from \u00a31370 to \u00a31790 (Rs. 13,700-17,900).\n\nTransit dues.\n\nTransit dues in 1815-16 yielded \u00a318,880 (Rs. 1,88,800); they have since been abolished.\n\nJustice.\n\nLaw and Justice receipts, chiefly fines, have risen from \u00a3389 to \u00a31471 (Rs. 3890-Rs. 14,710). The 1875-76 charges were \u00a310,280 (Rs. 1,02,800) against \u00a310,216 (Rs. 1,02,160) in 1815-16.\n\nForest.\n\nThere are no regular forests. The item \u00a3285 (Rs. 2850) represents the rental of lands credited to the Forest Department.\n\nAssessed taxes.\n\nThe following table shows, exclusive of official salaries, the amount realized from the different assessed taxes levied between 1860 and 1873. Owing to their variety of rates and incidence, it is difficult to make any satisfactory comparison of the results.\n\nKaira Assessed Taxes, 1860-1872.\n\n| Year | Below \u00a350. | Above \u00a350. | Realizations |\n|------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| Income Tax | \u00a3180,323 | Rs. 18,03,230 | \u00a3100,417 | Rs. 10,04,170 | \u00a37741 | Rs. 77,410 |\n| 1860-61 | \u00a3194,901 | Rs. 19,49,010 | \u00a3111,237 | Rs. 11,12,370 | \u00a38342 | Rs. 83,420 |\n| 1862-63 | \u00a3217,438 | Rs. 21,74,380 | \u00a3207,293 | Rs. 20,72,930 | \u00a33011 | Rs. 30,110 |\n| 1863-64 | \u00a3106,002 | Rs. 10,60,020 | \u00a33158 | Rs. 31,580 |\n| License Tax | \u00a3117,480 | Rs. 11,74,800 | \u00a388,317 | Rs. 8,83,170 | \u00a32699 | Rs. 26,990 |\n| Certificate Tax | \u00a3184,470 | Rs. 18,44,700 | \u00a31882 | Rs. 18,820 |\n| Income Tax | \u00a3336,746 | Rs. 33,67,460 | \u00a33557 | Rs. 35,570 |\n| 1869 | \u00a3336,616 | Rs. 33,66,160 | \u00a31779 | Rs. 17,790 |\n| 1870-71 | \u00a3316,951 | Rs. 31,69,510 | \u00a39443 | Rs. 94,430 |\n| 1871-72 | \u00a33653 | Rs. 36,530 |\n| 1872-73 | \u00a31340 | Rs. 13,400 |\nCustoms and Salt receipts have fallen from \u00a37442 to \u00a37067 (Rs. 74,420-Rs. 70,670). Under the existing system, revenue from the sale of opium and the amount of the bid for the right to sell the drug are credited to Customs, and the Government share in the Cambay salt revenue to Salt. In 1815-16 both were credited to Customs.\n\nUnder allowances and assignments the fall in charges is due to the settlement of cash alienations.\n\nMilitary charges in 1815-16 amounted to \u00a352,379 (Rs. 5,23,790). Owing to the removal of the military force from Kaira, only \u00a377 (Rs. 770) on account of pensioners were in 1875-76 debited to this head.\n\nRegistration and Education are new heads.\n\nTransfer receipts have risen from \u00a36315 to \u00a358,767 (Rs. 63,150-Rs. 5,87,670), and charges from \u00a372,707 to \u00a3209,644 (Rs. 7,27,070-Rs. 20,96,440). The increased receipts are due chiefly to receipts on account of local funds, to remittances from other treasuries, to the amount held as deposit on account of savings banks, and to the recovery of loans made to landed proprietors, th\u0101kors. The increased charges are due chiefly to a large surplus balance remitted to other treasuries and to the expenditure on account of local funds.\n\nIn the following balance sheets of 1815-16 and 1875-76, the figures shown in black type on both sides of the 1875-76 balance sheet are book adjustments. On the receipt side the item \u00a377,654 (Rs. 7,76,540) represents the additional revenue the district would yield, had none of its land been given away. On the debit side the item \u00a34090 (Rs. 40,900) under land revenue is the rental of the lands granted to village headmen, except those engaged solely on police duties and to the village watch. The item \u00a371,143 (Rs. 7,11,430) under allowances and assignments represents the rental of the lands granted to district hereditary officers, to gir\u0101si\u0101s, and other non-service claimants; the item \u00a32420 (Rs. 24,200) under police represents the rental of the lands granted to village headmen employed solely on police duties. Cash allowances are, on the other hand, treated as actual charges and debited to the different heads of account according to the nature of the allowance. Thus cash grants to village headmen, except those engaged solely on police duties and the village watch, are included in \u00a325,398 (Rs. 2,53,980), the total of land revenue charges; cash grants to non-service claimants are included in \u00a38493 (Rs. 84,930), the total of allowance and assignment charges; and cash grants to patels employed solely on police duties are included in \u00a313,690 (Rs. 1,36,900) the total of police charges.\n\n1 The Kaira district treasury was able in 1875-76 to send \u00a3183,100 (Rs. 18,31,000) to other districts.\n### Chapter X.\n#### Revenue and

promote rural education and supply roads, water, drains, rest-houses, dispensaries, and other useful objects amounted in the year 1877-78 to a total sum of \u00a320,340 (Rs. 2,03,400) and the expenditure to \u00a322,772 (Rs. 2,27,720). This revenue is drawn from three sources, a special cess of one-sixteenth in addition to the ordinary land-tax, the proceeds of certain subordinate local funds, and some miscellaneous items of revenue. The special land cess, of which two-thirds are set apart as a road fund and the rest as a school fund, yielded in 1877-78 a revenue of \u00a316,498 (Rs. 1,64,980). Smaller funds including a ferry fund, a toll fund, a cattle-pound fund, and a school fee-fund, yielded \u00a31478 (Rs. 14,780). Government and private subscriptions amounted to \u00a31629 (Rs. 16,290), and miscellaneous receipts including certain items of land revenue, to \u00a3735 (Rs. 7350), or a total sum of \u00a320,340 (Rs. 2,03,400). This revenue is administered by committees composed partly of official and partly of private members.\n\nFor administrative purposes the local funds of the district are divided into two main sections, one set apart for public works and the other for instruction. The receipts and disbursements during the year 1877-78 under those two heads were as follows:\n\nKaira Local Funds, 1877-78.\n\nPUBLIC WORKS.\n\n| Receipts | Expenditure |\n|----------|-------------|\n| \u00a3. s.    | \u00a3. s.       |\n| Balance, 1st April 1877 ... | 5082 11 | Establishment ... | 2599 4 |\n| Two-thirds of the land cess | 10,999 4 | New works ... | 9681 8 |\n| Tolls ... | 165 10 | Repairs ... | 1608 18 |\n| Ferries ... | 10 12 | Medical charges ... | 656 18 |\n| Cattle pounds ... | 569 18 | Miscellaneous ... | 371 19 |\n| Travellers' rest houses ... | 28 4 | Balance, 1st April 1878... | 2641 10 |\n| Contributions ... | 624 2 | Total ... | 17,559 17 |\n| Miscellaneous ... | 79 16 | Total ... | 17,559 17 |\n\nINSTRUCTION.\n\n| \u00a3. s. | \u00a3. s. |\n|-------|-------|\n| Balance, 1st April 1877 ... | 2908 2 | School charges ... | 5965 13 |\n| One-third of the land cess, | 5499 12 | Scholarships ... | 213 12 |\n| School fee fund ... | 731 3 | School houses, new ... | 477 6 |\n| Contribution (Government) | 997 14 | Do. repairs ... | 256 18 |\n| Do.

To improve communication 100 miles of road have been made, bridged, and for forty-four miles planted with trees. To improve the water supply 419 wells, 355 reservoirs and ponds, eight water courses and\nforty-seven troughs have been made or repaired. To help village instruction forty-two schools, and for the comfort of travellers eighty rest-houses and seventy-two village offices, chor\u00e1s, have been built. Besides these works six dispensaries and 190 cattle pounds have been constructed.\n\nIn 1877-78 there were five municipalities, all of them established since 1857. The total municipal revenue in 1877-78 amounted to \u00a35356 (Rs. 53,560). Of this sum \u00a32703 (Rs. 27,030) were recovered from octroi dues, \u00a3431 (Rs. 4310) from a toll and wheel-tax, \u00a3464 (Rs. 4640) from a house-tax, and \u00a31758 (Rs. 17,580) from miscellaneous sources. Under the provisions of the Bombay District Municipal Act VI. of 1873 all these municipalities are town municipalities administered by a body of commissioners with the Collector as president and the assistant or deputy collector in charge of the sub-division as vice president, the commissioners being chosen in the proportion of at least two non-official to each official member.\n\nThe following statement gives for each municipality the receipts, charges, and the incidence of taxation during the year ending 31st March 1878:\n\n**Kaira Municipal Details, 1878.**\n\n| Name       | Date          | Population | Receipts |\n|------------|---------------|------------|----------|\n|            |               |            | Octroi   | House-tax | Toll or Wheel tax | Miscellaneous | Total |\n| Kaira      | 15th Feb. 1857 | 12,681     | 210      | 464       | 81              | 755         |\n| Kapadvanj   | 7th May 1863  | 13,932     | 484      |           | 21              | 163         | 668   |\n| Mehmadabad | 15th Aug. 1863| 8065       | 139      |           | 23              | 182         | 344   |\n| D\u00e1kor      | 20th June 1864| 7740       | 925      |           |                 | 1056        | 1981  |\n| Nadiad     | 16th May 1866 | 24,551     | 945      |           | 387             | 276         | 1608  |\n| **Total**  |               | 67,019     | 2703     | 464       | 431             | 1758        | 5356  |\n\n| Name       | Date          | Expenditure |\n|------------|---------------|-------------|\n|            |               | Establishment | Safety | Health | Instruction | Convenience | Miscellaneous | Total |\n| Kaira      | 15th Feb. 1857| 109         | 178    | 254    | 54         | 70          | 53            | 24    | 752   | 1 2 |\n| Kapadvanj   | 7th May 1863  | 71          | 159    | 364    | 49         | 22          | 79            | 10    | 754   | 0 11|\n| Mehmadabad | 15th Aug. 1863| 20          | 67     | 243    | 10         | 49          | 18            | 5     | 412   | 0 10|\n| D\u00e1kor      | 20th June 1864| 64          | 170    | 555    | 31         | 283         | 10            | 1042  | 2155  | 5 1 |\n| Nadiad     | 16th May 1866 | 130         | 390    | 784    | 81         | 441         | 114           | 98    | 2638  | 1 3 |\n| **Total**  |               | 394         | 964    | 2210   | 225       | 865         | 274           | 1179  | 6111  |\n\nAt present (1878) an establishment in connection with the Cotton Frauds Act (Bombay Act IX. of 1863) for preventing the adulteration of cotton is, under the control of the Collector, maintained at a total yearly cost of \u00a3180 (Rs. 1800). This charge is met from the cotton improvement fund framed under the provisions of the Act. The establishment consists of a sub-inspector drawing a monthly salary of \u00a312 (Rs. 120), and a messenger on 18s. (Rs. 9) a month.\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nINSTRUCTION.\n\nIn 1877-78 there were 190 Government schools, or on an average one school for every three inhabited villages, alienated as well as Government, with 14,930 pupils on the rolls and an average attendance of 10,508 or 2\u00b724 per cent of 407,818, the entire population of not more than twenty years of age.\n\nExcluding superintendence charges, the total expenditure on education on account of these 190 Government schools and of two Cambay private schools inspected by education officers, amounted to \u00a37516 (Rs. 75,160). Of this \u00a31492 (Rs. 14,920) were debited to Government and \u00a36024 (Rs. 60,240) to local and other funds.\n\nUnder the Director of public instruction and the inspector northern division the schooling of the district was conducted by a local staff 430 strong; of these one was a deputy inspector with general charge over all the schools of the district, drawing yearly pay of \u00a3180 (Rs. 1800); two were assistant deputy inspectors entrusted with the examination of the vernacular schools in the M\u00e1tar, Mehmadabad, A'nand, and Borsad sub-divisions, drawing together yearly pay of \u00a3180 (Rs. 1800); and the rest were masters and assistant masters of schools with yearly salaries ranging from \u00a3240 to \u00a32 8s. (Rs. 2400 to Rs. 24).\n\nOf 190, the total number of Government schools, in 181 Gujar\u00e1ti only was taught, and in six Urdu and Gujar\u00e1ti. Two were Anglo-vernacular schools teaching English and Gujar\u00e1ti. One was a high school teaching English, Gujar\u00e1ti, and Sanskrit up to the standard required for the University entrance test examination.\n\nIn addition to the Government schools there were at Cambay two private vernacular boys' schools supported by private individuals and school fees, and inspected by education officers. The average attendance of pupils in these schools amounted to 171 out of a roll-call of 288 boys. Besides the two in Cambay there were in Kaira,\u00b9 as shown in the margin, sixty-one private schools teaching 2049 pupils. Some account of the teaching given in these schools will be found in the Broach Statistical Account.

The first two Government vernacular schools were opened in 1826, one of them at Kaira and the other at Nadiad. Four years later three more vernacular schools were started at Mahudha, Kapadvanj, and Umreth. During the next eighteen years only two more vernacular schools were opened, one at Matar in 1838 and the other at Mehmadabad in 1848. In 1850-51 there were seven Government schools with 472 names on the rolls or 0\u00b714 per cent of 316,827, the total population of not more than twenty years of age. In 1855-56 there were seven Government schools and eighty-four private schools. At the Government schools were 829 pupils; at Kaira 102, at Kapadvanj sixty-one, at Mahudha 103, at Matar ninety-five, at Mehmadabad fifty-eight, at Nadiad 299, and at Umreth 111. Of the eighty-four private schools with an estimated attendance of 6000 pupils, thirty, open only during the rains, were taught by Brahman youths. Children generally went first to a private school, learning to read and write Gujarati, and gaining some knowledge of accounts. They paid a daily allowance \u00bc lb. of grain, a fee of \u00bdd. (three pies) on holidays, and at the time of leaving from 4s. to 10s. (Rs. 2-Rs. 5). The training at the Government schools, though little liked by the people was said to be better than in the private schools, the children learning grammar, mathematics, geography, and history. Of a total male population of 325,755 souls only 63,108 could read and write Gujarati. Brahmins and the poorer Varnas, especially those brought up in towns, looking for their living to Government service, were the best educated. Rich traders and money-lenders seldom sent their children to Government schools. Rajput and Koli landlords had shown themselves anxious to have their children taught. Though few of their sons tried to enter Government service, the knowledge that for the place of village manager men able to read and write were preferred, made shareholders and heads of villages anxious to teach their children. In some cases they had offered to supply a room and school furniture if Government gave a master. The Kolis, almost entirely illiterate, were doing little to teach their children. They were seldom seen at Government schools and, at private schools, numbered only forty-two out of the total of 6000 pupils.\n\nThe first two Government English schools were started in 1856, one at Nadiad and the other at Kaira. In 1865-66 the number of schools had risen to ninety-seven and the average attendance to 6262 pupils out of a roll-call of 9635 names or 1\u00b764 per cent of 381,819, the total population of not more than twenty years of age. The figures for 1877-78 were, as shown above, 190 schools with a\n\nIn 1825 Bishop Heber found in most of the chief towns large schools where the children of Hindu traders learnt writing, reading, accounts, and such portion of the natural religion as their caste was allowed to receive. Kolis and Rajputs seldom sent their children to school.\u2014Heb. Nar. II. 145. In 1826 the Collector found that out of office hours the clerks were teaching boys English and suggested to Government that a school might be opened,\u201462, 8th Sept. 1826.\ntotal average attendance of 10,308 out of 14,930 names on the rolls or 2\u00b742 per cent of 425,147, the total population of not more than twenty years of age. A comparison with the returns for 1850 gives therefore for 1877-78 an increase in the number of schools from seven to 190; while of 425,147, the entire population of the district of not more than twenty years of age, 2\u00b742 per cent were under instruction in 1877-78 against 0\u00b714 per cent in 1850-51.\n\nGirls' schools.\n\nGirls' schools have been introduced during the last twenty years. Rising from four in 1865-66 to thirteen in 1873-74, they have again (1877-78) fallen to ten. But the attendance has continued to increase, the total number on the rolls rising from 309 in 1865 to 517 in 1873 and 765 in 1878, and the average attendance from 162 in 1865 to 281 in 1873 and 405 in 1878.\n\nPopulation able to read and write, 1872.\n\nThe 1872 census returns give for each of the chief races of the district the proportion of persons able to read and write:\n\nOf 143,485, the total Hindu male population not exceeding twelve years, 9132 or 6\u00b736 per cent; of 62,493 above twelve and not exceeding twenty years, 7526 or 12\u00b704 per cent; and of 176,162 exceeding twenty years, 20,928 or 11\u00b787 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught. Of 116,458, the total Hindu female population not exceeding twelve years, 104 or 0\u00b708 per cent; of 48,184 above twelve and not exceeding twenty years, forty-six or 0\u00b709 per cent; and of 164,837 exceeding twenty years, seventy-six or 0\u00b704 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught.\n\nMuhammadans.\n\nOf 14,363, the total Musalm\u00e1n male population not exceeding twelve years, 575 or 4 per cent; of 5698 above twelve and not exceeding twenty years, 422 or 7\u00b740 per cent; and of 16,728 exceeding twenty years, 1178 or 7\u00b704 per cent, were able to read and write or were being taught. Of 11,783, the total Musalm\u00e1n female population not exceeding twelve years, three or 0\u00b702 per cent; of 5155 above twelve and not exceeding twenty years, sixteen or 0\u00b731 per cent; and of 17,014 exceeding twenty years, thirty-three or 0\u00b719 per cent, were able to read and write or were being taught.\n\nParsis.\n\nOf seventeen, the total P\u00e1rsi male population not exceeding twelve years, eight or 47\u00b705 per cent; of six above twelve and not exceeding twenty years, six or cent per cent; and of eighteen exceeding twenty years, seventeen or 94\u00b744 per cent, were able to read and write or were being taught. Of fifteen the total P\u00e1rsi female population not exceeding twelve years, six or 40 per cent; and of twelve exceeding twenty years, five or 41\u00b766 per cent, were able to read and write or were being taught.\n\n---\n\n1 In the census of 1846 the total population of the district was returned at 566,513 souls, and in that of 1872 at 782,733, of whom persons not exceeding twenty years of age numbered 407,818. On the basis of these figures, the totals of population not more than twenty years of age for 1851, 1856, 1866, and 1876 have been calculated. Details of private schools are available only for 1875-76 and have therefore been left out.\nBefore the year 1865-66 there were no returns arranging the pupils according to race and religion. The statement given in the margin shows that of the three chief races of the district, the P\u00e1rsis have the largest proportion of their boys and girls under instruction. Since 1865 a considerable advance has been made by the Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nOf 765 the total number of girls enrolled in 1877-78 in the ten girls' schools, 731 or 95\u00b756 per cent were Hindus; thirty or 3\u00b792 per cent were Musalm\u00e1ns; and four or 0\u00b752 per cent were P\u00e1rsis.\n\nOf 13,168, the total number of pupils in Government schools at the end of December 1877, 2976 or 22\u00b760 per cent were Br\u00e1hmans; fifty or 0\u00b738 per cent writers, forty-two Kshatris, six K\u00e1yasths, and two Parbh\u00fas; 2747 or 20\u00b786 per cent traders and shopkeepers, 1942 V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, 605 Shr\u00e1vaks, thirty-nine Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, and 161 Luh\u00e1n\u00e1s; 4698 or 35\u00b767 per cent cultivators, 3763 Kanbis, 246 Rajputs, 140 K\u00e1chhi\u00e1s, thirty-one M\u00e1lis, and 518 Kolis; 811 or 6\u00b716 per cent craftsmen, 134 Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs, calicoprinters, twenty-one Khatris, weavers, fifteen Gh\u00e1nchis, oil pressers, 141 Sonis, gold and silver smiths, 212 Suth\u00e1rs, carpenters, thirty-four Kans\u00e1r\u00e1s, copper-smiths, 105 Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths, seven Kadiy\u00e1s, bricklayers, two Sal\u00e1ts, masons, fifty-seven Darjis, tailors, and eighty-three Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 190 or 1\u00b744 per cent bards and genealogists, 183 Bh\u00e1ts and seven Ch\u00e1rans; 179 or 1\u00b736 per cent servants, 162 Haj\u00e1ms, barbers, fifteen Dhobhis, washermen, and two Bhistis, water drawers; eleven or 0\u00b78 per cent, Rab\u00e1ris, shepherds; twenty-four or 0\u00b718 per cent Bhois and M\u00e1chhis, fishers and labourers; eighty-seven or 0\u00b766 per cent, labourers and miscellaneous workers, twenty-four Gol\u00e1s, ricepounders, twenty-one Kal\u00e1ls, liquor sellers, thirty-four R\u00e1val\u00ed\u00e1s, cotton tapemakers, five V\u00e1ghris, fowlers and hunters, and three M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis; forty-four or 0\u00b733 per cent Mochis, shoemakers; eighty-six or 0\u00b765 per cent religious beggars, thirty Vair\u00e1gis, forty-seven Gos\u00e1is, and nine S\u00e1dhus; eighteen or 0\u00b713 per cent P\u00e1rsis; and 1245 or 9\u00b745 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns.

present (1877-78) provision for teaching the district town and country population gives the following results.\n\nIn the town of Kapadvanj there were in 1877-78 three Government vernacular schools with, out of 452 names on the rolls, an average attendance of 366 pupils. Of these schools two were for boys and one for girls; the yearly cost for each pupil in the boys' schools was 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd), and in the girls' school 13s. (Rs. 6\u00bd). In the town of Kaira there were in 1877-78 four Government schools with, out of 472 names on the rolls, an average attendance of 333 pupils. Of these schools one was an Anglo-vernacular, one an Urdu, and two were Gujarati schools, one for boys and the other for girls. The yearly cost for each pupil was \u00a35 1s. (Rs. 50\u00bd) in the Anglo-vernacular, \u00a32 2s. (Rs. 21) in the girls', and from 14s. to 16s. (Rs. 7-Rs. 8) in the other schools. In the town of Nadiad there were in 1877-78 eight Government schools with, out of 1481 names on the rolls, an average attendance of 1039 pupils. Of these schools one was a High school, one an Anglo-vernacular school, four were Gujarati boys' schools, one a Gujarati girls' school and one an Urdu school. The yearly cost for each pupil in the high school was \u00a39 11s. (Rs. 95\u00bd); in the Anglo-vernacular school, \u00a33 4s. (Rs. 32); in the girls' school, \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 12); in the rest it varied from 4s. to 18s. (Rs. 2-Rs. 9).\n\nThe number of pupils that passed their University entrance test examination from the Nadiad high school was seven in 1873, three in 1874, four in 1875, five in 1876, and three in 1877. In the town of Mahudha there were in the year 1877-78 five Government schools with, out of 626 names on the rolls, an average attendance of 435 pupils. Of these one was an Urdu school, and four were Gujarati schools, three for boys and one for girls. The yearly cost for each pupil varied from 10s. to \u00a31 13s. (Rs. 5-Rs. 16\u00bd). In the town of Umreth there were in 1877-78 five Government schools with, out of 739 names on the rolls, an average attendance of 538 pupils. Of these schools four were Gujarati schools, three for boys and one for girls, and one was an Urdu school. The yearly cost for each pupil was \u00a31 7s. (Rs. 13\u00bd) in the girls', and 19s. (Rs. 9\u00bd) in the Urdu school; in the rest it varied from 6s. to 13s. (Rs. 3-Rs. 6\u00bd). In the town of Borsad there were in 1877-78 three vernacular schools, two for boys, and one for girls with, out of 385 names on the rolls, an average attendance of 270 pupils. The yearly cost for each pupil amounted to 12s. (Rs. 6).\n\nExclusive of these six towns the district of Kaira was in 1877-78 provided with 153 Government vernacular schools, or on an average one school for every 3\u00b744 inhabited villages. The following statement shows the distribution of these schools by sub-divisions:\n\n| Sub-Division | Villages | Population | Vernacular Schools |\n|--------------|----------|------------|-------------------|\n|              |          |            | Boys | Girls |\n| Kapadvanj    | 85       | 72,769     | 9    | 18   |\n| Thara        | 100      | 85,601     | 17   | 1    |\n| Mehmabad     | 59       | 73,073     | 17   | 1    |\n| Nadiad       | 91       | 117,548    | 27   | 1    |\n| Total        |          | 579        | 695,967 | 158 |\n\nKaira, Village Schools, 1877-78.\nKAIRA.\n\nIn the Kaira district there is one library in the town of Kaira known as the \"Hadow Institute.\" It was established in October 1863 by Mr. Hadow, then Collector of Kaira. Supported partly by private subscriptions and partly by a contribution from the Kaira municipality, this library contains 1552 volumes and a reading room supplied with four English and seven vernacular papers. There are at present (1877-78) forty-six subscribers. The total amount realized during the year 1877-78 was \u00a351 (Rs. 510) and the expenditure \u00a355 (Rs. 550).\n\nBesides the library in the town of Kaira, there are as shown below in different parts of the district twelve reading rooms:\n\n| Sub-division | Town or Village | Newspapers | Books | Sub-division | Town or Village | Newspapers | Books |\n|--------------|----------------|------------|-------|--------------|----------------|------------|-------|\n| Kapadvanj    | Kapadvanj      | 1          | 7     | Nadiad       | Mahudha        | 4          | 444   |\n| Do           | Kathlal        | 2          | 50    | Mehmadabad   | Mehmadabad    | 7          | 376   |\n| Th\u00e1sra       | Th\u00e1sra         | 1          | 6     | A'nand       | A'nand        | 1          | 19    |\n| Th\u00e1sra       | D\u00e1kor          | 5          | 292   | A'nand       | N\u00e1pad         | 2          | 51    |\n| Nadiad       | Nadiad         | 3          | 16    | A'nand       | Umreth        | 1          | 322   |\n| Nadiad       | Moholel        | 2          | 24    | Borsad       | Virsad        | 3          | 49    |\n\nIn 1874 the district supported four local Gujarati newspapers, the Kaira Niti Prak\u00e1sh or Moral Luminary, of eighteen years' standing; the Kaira Vartm\u00e1n or News, of fourteen years; the Nadiad Dun\u00eddad or World Redresser, of about three years' standing; and the Mahudha 'Adal Ins\u00e1f' or Pure Justice. Only two of these papers, lithographed weeklies their articles chiefly borrowed, the Kaira Vartm\u00e1n with a circulation of 153 and the Niti Prak\u00e1sh of 115 copies are still (1878) in existence.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThe prevailing disease is malarious fever. This form of sickness generally makes its appearance soon after the beginning of the rains (June-July). Fever cases increase in number and severity from the latter part of September through October into the early days of November, when as the climate grows drier and colder the disease gradually disappears. Early in this century Kaira was considered one of the healthiest places in Gujar\u00e1t, and partly for this reason a large body of European troops was stationed there. But several seasons between 1820 and 1830 were marked by severe epidemics, and the troops especially the European cavalry suffered terribly. So great was the mortality that Kaira ceased to be used as a large military station. Of late years, apparently without any special cause unless the drainage of the lands to the south and west of Kaira has changed the character of the prevailing breeze, the climate has again improved and Kaira is not now considered so trying to European constitutions as several other Gujar\u00e1t stations. The different forms of skin disease and ear-ache are, especially among children, very common complaints. For many years no severe epidemic visited Kaira. But in the month of April 1876 a serious outbreak of cholera occurred. In the town of Nadi\u00e1d alone 905 persons were attacked. The disease came to Nadi\u00e1d from Baroda. At first of a very mild type, it afterwards became more deadly. From Nadi\u00e1d cholera gradually spread over almost the whole district, working on the whole from north to south or against the prevailing wind. Fresh outbreaks were, as a rule, found to have followed some great caste feast or other occasion of unusual indulgence. The disease continued throughout the hot season (March-June) gradually disappearing after the first fall of rain. Of 4973 persons attacked, about one-third or 2\u00b711 per thousand of the total population died.\n\nIn the year 1877 there were in the district of Kaira, besides the civil and police hospitals, six dispensaries all established since 1866. During the year 1877, 59,328 persons were treated in these hospitals and dispensaries, of whom 1429 were in-door and 57,899 out-door patients. All these institutions are provided with special buildings. The total amount spent in checking disease in 1877 was \u00a32036 (Rs. 20,360); of this \u00a31176 (Rs. 11,760) were paid from provincial revenues, \u00a3397 (Rs. 3970) from local and \u00a3463 (Rs. 4630) from municipal funds. The following working details are taken from the 1877 hospital reports.\n\nThe Kaira civil hospital has a building of its own, raised in 1873 at a cost of \u00a32948 (Rs. 29,480), met partly from Kaira municipal and\npartly from local funds. Of in-patients the total treated numbered 474. Of these 420 were cured, twenty-three left, eleven died, and twenty remained under treatment at the end of the year. The total attendance of out-patients was 6341, or a falling off on the returns of the preceding year of nearly 3000. The average daily sick for in and out-patients was 14\u00b73 and 54\u00b76 respectively. The chief causes of sickness were ague, syphilis, bowel diseases, ulcers, skin affections and injuries. The total number of patients treated in the police hospital was 153.\n\nThe Mehmadabad dispensary was opened in 1871. The total treated was 10,306, of whom 193 were in-patients, an increase on the year before of twenty-four. The chief diseases were eye and skin affections, ulcers, malarious fevers, rheumatism and diarrhoea. The Nadi\u00e1d dispensary was opened in 1866. Including 133 in-patients the total treated numbered 14,241, an increase on the year before of nearly 1300. The principal causes of sickness were malarious fevers, eye and skin diseases, rheumatism, and venereal affections. The Borsad dispensary was opened in 1867. The total treated was 5952 including 196 in-patients, an increase of nearly 1800 on the year before. The prevailing maladies were fevers, eye and skin diseases, and ulcers. The Mahudha dispensary in the Nadi\u00e1d sub-division was opened in 1869. The total treated numbered 5551, of whom forty-seven were in-patients. The chief diseases were fevers, eye and skin affections, and ulcers. The D\u00e1kor dispensary in the Th\u00e1sra sub-division was opened in 1866. The total treated numbered 7299, of whom 145 were in-patients or more than 1300 less than in the year before. The chief diseases were fevers, cholera, syphilis, and eye and skin affections. The Kapadvanj dispensary was opened in 1866. The total treated was 9011, of whom eighty-eight were in-patients, or 2100 more than in the year before. The principal diseases were malarious fevers, eye and skin affections, and ulcers.\n\nIn 1877-78 the work of vaccination was, under the supervision of the deputy sanitary commissioner in eastern Gujar\u00e1t, carried on by nine vaccinators, with yearly salaries varying from \u00a316 16s. to \u00a328 16s. (Rs. 168 - Rs. 288.) Of the operators eight were distributed over the rural parts of the district, one for each sub-division. The duties of the ninth vaccinator were confined to the town of Nadi\u00e1d. Exclusive of 614 re-vaccinations the total number of operations performed in the year amounted to 23,437, compared with 25,035 primary vaccinations in 1869-70.\n\nThe following abstract shows the chief points of interest connected with the age and the race of the persons vaccinated:\n\n**Kaira, Vaccination Details, 1869-70.**\n\n| Year | Sex | Religion | Age |\n|------|-----|----------|-----|\n|      | Male | Female | Hindus | Musalm\u00e1ns | P\u00e1rsis | Christians | Others | Under one year | Above one year | Total |\n| 1869-70 | 13,790 | 11,245 | 20,733 | 2307 | 1 | 5 | 1989 | 19,742 | 5293 | 25,035 |\n| 1877-78 | 12,941 | 10,496 | 19,271 | 2477 | 6 | 25 | 1658 | 16,203 | 6174 | 23,437 |\nChapter XII.\n\nThe total cost of these operations was in 1877-78 \u00a3523 2s. (Rs. 5281), or about 5\u00bdd. (3\u00bd as.) for each successful case. The entire charge was made up of the following items; supervision and inspection \u00a3245 18s. (Rs. 2459), establishment \u00a3252 (Rs. 2520), and contingencies \u00a325 4s. (Rs. 252). Of these, the supervising and inspecting charges and 12s. (Rs. 6) on account of contingencies were wholly met from Government provincial funds. Of the remainder, the expense of \u00a3250 (Rs. 2500) was borne by the local funds, while in Nadiad the municipality paid the sum of \u00a326 8s. (Rs. 264) for the services of the town vaccinator.\n\nVital statistics, 1871-78.\n\nThe total number of deaths in the seven years ending 1878, as shown in the Sanitary Commissioner's annual reports is 139,542, or an average yearly mortality of 19,934, or assuming the figures of the census of 1872 as a basis, of 2\u00b755 per cent of the total population. Of the average number of deaths 15,078 or 75\u00b764 per cent were returned as due to fever; 2022 or 10\u00b714 per cent to bowel complaints; 751 or 3\u00b773 per cent to cholera; 492 or 2\u00b747 per cent to small-pox; and 1289 or 6\u00b747 per cent to miscellaneous diseases. Deaths from violence or accidents averaged 302 or 1\u00b752 per cent of the average mortality of the district. During the same period the number of births is returned at 115,539 souls, of whom 62,739 are entered as male and 52,791 as female children, or an average yearly birth rate of 16,504 souls; or, on the basis of the census figures, a birth rate of 2\u00b711 per cent of the entire population of the district.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The figures are incorrect, for while the population of the district is increasing the returns show a birth rate less by 3430 than the death rate. The explanation probably is that nearly all the deaths, and not nearly all of the births are recorded.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nSUB-DIVISIONS.\n\nKapadvanj Sub-division.\u2014The Kapadvanj sub-division, an irregular oblong figure about fifteen miles from north to south and thirty from east to west, is bounded on the north by the Atarsumba sub-division of Baroda territory and by portions of the Mahi K\u00e1ntha; on the east by the B\u00e1lasmor state; on the south and southwest by the Th\u00e1sra, Nadi\u00e1d, and Mehmadabad sub-divisions of the Kaira district; and on the west by the Daskroi sub-division of Ahmedabad. The total area is 279 square miles, and the population, according to the census of 1872, 86,742 souls, or an average density of 310\u00b790 to the square mile. In 1876-77 the realizable land revenue amounted to \u00a314,621 (Rs. 1,46,210).\n\nOf the total area of 279 square miles, 11 are occupied by the lands of alienated and unsettled, mehv\u00e1s, villages. The remainder, according to the revenue survey returns, contains 128,178 acres or 74\u00b759 per cent, of occupied land; 19,696 acres or 11\u00b746 per cent, of culturable waste; 15,059 acres or 8\u00b776 per cent, of uncultivable waste; 3624 acres or 2\u00b710 per cent, of grass lands; and 5276 acres or 3\u00b707 per cent, of roads, river beds, ponds and village sites. From 147,874 acres, 43,681 have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages. Of the balance of 104,193 acres, the actual area of culturable Government land, 63,733 or 61\u00b717 per cent were in 1876-77 under tillage.\n\nFor the most part, especially towards the south and west, Kapadvanj is a rich, highly cultivated plain, well clothed with trees. But towards the north and east and to some extent in the south-east, are tracts of waste, m\u00e1l, land roughened by streams and water courses and covered with brushwood.\n\nThe climate is generally healthy and in the hot season cooler than in most of the surrounding districts, with a well distributed rainfall of about twenty-five inches.\n\nExcept the Mohar, which flowing southwards to join the Shedhi passes almost through the centre of the sub-division, and the V\u00e1trak in the west, Kapadvanj is almost entirely without streams. Like several of the smaller Gujar\u00e1t rivers the water of the Mohar is charged with soda, and though useful for domestic purposes, is of no service for irrigation except to a small extent in watering wheat. The water supply is scanty. The storage in reservoirs is insufficient for irrigation, and the wells do not yield more than is wanted for household use. The 1876 water-supply figures were 36 wells with\nsteps, 1006 wells without steps, 36 water lifts, *dhelkudis*, 570 ponds or reservoirs, and 96 rivers, streams, and springs.\n\nVarying in texture from sand to mould, the soil is over the greater part of the area, of the light, *gor\u00e1du*, class. It wants constant dressing, but when well tilled yields a good return.\n\nThe following statement shows the arable area in Government villages, and the rates fixed in 1863-64:\n\n**Kapadvanj Rent-roll, 1863-64**\n\n| Tenure | Arable Land | Occupied | Unoccupied | Total |\n|--------|-------------|----------|------------|-------|\n|        | Acres       | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate Rs. a. p. | Acres | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate Rs. a. p. | Acres | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate Rs. a. p. |\n| Govt.  |             |           |            |       |                 |                        |       |                 |                        |\n| Dry crop | 77,419     | 1,00,723 | 1 4 10     | 19,513 | 19,241          | 0 15 9                | 96,332 | 1,19,079         | 1 8 10               |\n| Garden | 1,339       | 4,594    | 3 6 11     | 27     | 51              | 1 14 3                | 1,336  | 4,645            | 3 6 5                 |\n| Rice   | 5736        | 15,996   | 2 10 1     | 156    | 360             | 2 4 11                | 5895   | 15,446           | 2 9 11                |\n| Total  | 84,497      | 1,20,418 | 1 6 9      | 19,696 | 19,652          | 0 15 11               | 104,193 | 1,40,070         | 1 5 6                 |\n| Aliated |           |          |            |       |                 |                        |       |                 |                        |\n| Dry crop | 38,551     | 61,038   | 1 9 4      | ...    | ...             | ...                   | 38,551 | 61,038           | 1 9 4                 |\n| Garden | 1,482       | 5130     | 3 7 6      | ...    | ...             | ...                   | 1,482  | 5130             | 3 7 6                 |\n| Rice   | 3646        | 9,892    | 2 11 6     | ...    | ...             | ...                   | 3,646  | 9,892            | 2 11 6                |\n| Total  | 43,681      | 76,060   | 1 11 10    | ...    | ...             | ...                   | 43,681 | 76,060           | 1 11 10               |\n| Total  |             |          |            |       |                 |                        |       |                 |                        |\n| Dry crop | 115,970    | 1,61,776 | 1 6 4      | 19,513 | 19,241          | 0 15 9                | 135,483 | 1,81,017         | 1 5 5                 |\n| Garden | 2,821       | 9,724    | 3 2 2      | 27     | 51              | 1 14 3                | 2,821  | 9,724            | 3 2 2                 |\n| Rice   | 9,957       | 24,978   | 2 10 7     | 156    | 360             | 2 4 11                | 9,957  | 24,978           | 2 10 7                |\n| Grand Total | 128,175 | 1,90,478 | 1 8 6      | 19,696 | 19,652          | 0 15 11               | 147,374 | 2,16,130         | 1 7 5                 |\n\nRs. a. p. \u00a3. s. d.\n\nAssessment on Government and alienated land ... 2,16,129 13 0 21,612 19 7\u00bd\nDeduct\u2014Alienations ... ... ... ... ... 76,060 2 0 7606 0 3\nRemains ... ... ... ... ... 1,40,069 11 0 14,006 19 4\u00bd\nAdd\u2014Quitrents ... ... ... ... ... 39,373 15 2 3937 7 10\u00be\n,, \u2014Grazing farms and river-bed tillage ... ... ... ... ... 7124 10 2 712 9 3\u00bc\nTotal revenue ... ... ... ... ... 1,86,568 4 4 18,656 16 6\u00bd\n\nThe rates of assessment introduced in 1863-64 remain in force till 1891-92.\n\nThe 1872 population, 86,742 souls lodged in 24,770 houses were in 1876-77 supplied with 1042 wells and 570 ponds, and owned 9442 ploughs, 2809 carts, 20,570 oxen, 14,496 cows, 17,249 buffaloes, 380 horses, 7319 sheep and goats, 537 asses, and 6 camels.\n\nIn 1863-64, the year of settlement, 13,383 holdings, *kh\u00e1t\u00e1s*, were recorded, with an average area of 9\u00be acres, and a rental of \u00a31 13s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 11-15-0). Equally divided among the agricultural population these holdings would, for each person, represent an allotment of 2\u00be acres at a yearly rent of 6s. 10\u00bed. (Rs. 3-6-11).\n\nIf distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the\nshare per head would amount to $1\\frac{3}{4}$ acres, and the incidence of the land tax to 4s. 5\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-3-6).\n\nIn 1876-77, of 63,733 acres, the total area of cultivated land, 4718 or 7\u00b740 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 59,015 acres, 3826 were twice cropped. Of the 62,841 acres under actual cultivation, grain crops occupied 55,650 or 88\u00b755 per cent, 27,779 of them under bajri, Penicillaria spicata; 8513 under rice, d\u00e2ngar, Oryza sativa; 6556 under jua\u00e1r, Sorghum vulgare; 5794 under b\u00e2vta, Panicum frumentaceum; 4365 under kadra, Paspalum scrobiculatum; 2128 under wheat, ghanu, Triticum aestivum; and 515 under miscellaneous cereals comprising barley, jav, Hordeum hexastichon; maize, mak\u00e1di, Zea mays; r\u00e2ggaro, Amaranthus paniculatus; and k\u00e2ng, Panicum italicum. Pulses occupied 6111 acres or 9\u00b772 per cent, 2000 of them under math, Phaseolus aconitifolius; 2000 under gram, chana, Cicer arietinum; 1000 under mag, Phaseolus radiatus; 400 under adad, Phaseolus mungo; 300 under tuver, Cajanus indicus; and 411 under miscellaneous pulses comprising guvar, Cyamopsis psoralioides; chola, Vigna catiang; and v\u00e1l, Dolichos lablab. Oil seeds occupied 471 acres or 0\u00b775 per cent, 216 of them under tal, Sesamum indicum; and 255 under other oil seeds, details of which are not available.\n\nFibres occupied 98 acres or 0\u00b715 per cent, 93 of them under cotton, kap\u00e1s, Gossypium herbaceum; and 5 under Bombay hemp, san, Crotalaria juncea. Miscellaneous crops occupied 511 acres or 0\u00b781 per cent, 67 of them under tobacco, tamb\u00e1ku, Nicotiana tabacum; and 444 under miscellaneous vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1872 census returns show of a total population of 86,742 souls, 78,250 or 90\u00b721 per cent, Hindus; 8485 or 9\u00b778 per cent, Musalm\u00e1ns; and seven under the head \u2018Others.\u2019 Statistics specially prepared from the enumerators\u2019 forms give the following caste details: 5750 Br\u00e1hmans; 7 Parbh\u00fas; 3557 V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s; 489 Shrav\u00e1ks; 43 Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s; 7708 Kanbis; 1475 Rajputs; 270 K\u00e1chhi\u00e1s; 59 M\u00e1lis; 578 Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs, calicoprinters; 392 Som\u00eds, gold and silver smiths; 958 Suth\u00e1rs, carpenters; 27 Kans\u00e1rs, brass and copper smiths; 791 Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 283 Darjis, tailors; 3 Sal\u00e1ts, masons; 256 Ch\u00e1ranas, bards and genealogists; 10 Gandhraps, songsters; 1054 Kumhb\u00e1hrs, potters; 1069 Haj\u00e1ms, barbers; 63 Dhobhis, washermen; 6 Bh\u00edsts, water drawers; 198 Bharv\u00e1ds, herdsmen; 1028 Rab\u00e1ris, shepherds; 882 Bhois, fishers and labourers; 50 Gol\u00e1s, ricepounders; 10 Bh\u00e1dhbh\u00faj\u00e1s, grainpachers; 11 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; 279 V\u00e1ghris, fowlers and hunters; 1132 R\u00e1val\u00edas, cotton tapemakers; 41,869 Kol\u00eds; 405 Mochis, shoemakers; 1152 Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s, tanners; 232 M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis; 36 Ods, diggers; 18 Baj\u00e1ni\u00e1s, acrobats; 24 Kal\u00e1ls, liquor sellers; 26 Vanj\u00e1ras, grain carriers; 607 Sindhv\u00e1s; 52 Turis; 3413 Dheds; 274 Garud\u00e1s; 1402 Bhangi\u00e1s and 202 religious beggars. As regards occupation the same return arranges the population under the seven following classes: i. Employed under Government or municipal or other local authorities, 373. ii. Professional persons, 452. iii. In service or performing personal offices, 974. iv. Engaged in agriculture and with animals, (a) cultivators 16,780 (b) labourers 595, total 17,375. v. Engaged in commerce and trade, 826. vi. Employed\nin mechanical arts, manufactures, and engineering operations, and engaged in the sale of articles manufactured or otherwise prepared for consumption, 7165. vii. Miscellaneous persons not classed otherwise, (a) women 24,298, and children 34,685, in all 58,983; and (b) miscellaneous persons, 594; total 59,577.\n\nThe total number of deaths registered in the five years ending 1874-75 was 8001, or an average yearly mortality of 1600, or on the basis of the 1872 census figures 1\u00b784 per cent of 86,742, the total population of the sub-division. Of the average number of deaths, 1331 or 83\u00b718 per cent were returned as due to fever; 31 or 1\u00b793 per cent, to diarrhoea and dysentery; 34 or 2\u00b712 per cent, to smallpox; 42 or 2\u00b762 per cent, to cholera; and 137 or 8\u00b756 per cent, to miscellaneous diseases. Deaths from accidents and violence averaged 25 or 1\u00b756 per cent of the average mortality of the sub-division. During the same period the births of 6898 children were registered, 3829 males and 3069 females, or an average yearly birth rate of 1379 or 1\u00b758 per cent of the population.\n\nTh\u00e1sra Sub-division.\u2014The Th\u00e1sra sub-division is bounded on the north by Kapadvanj and the B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor state, on the east by the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, on the south by A'nand, and on the west by N\u00e1di\u00e1d. The total area is 255 square miles, and the population, according to the census of 1872, 85,601 souls, or an average density of 335\u00b769 to the square mile. In 1876-77 the realizable land revenue amounted to \u00a318,334 (Rs. 1,83,340).\n\nOf the total area of 255 square miles, 29 are occupied by the lands of alienated and unsettled, mehv\u00e1s, villages. The remainder, according to the revenue survey returns, contains 106,360 acres or 73\u00b782 per cent, of occupied land; 20,684 acres or 14\u00b726 per cent, of culturable waste; 8387 acres or 5\u00b778 per cent, of unculturable waste; 42 acres of grass; and 9584 acres, or 6\u00b760 per cent, of roads, ponds, river beds, and village sites. From 127,044 acres, 32,549 have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages. Of the balance of 94,495 acres, the actual area of culturable Government land, 54,052 or 57\u00b720 per cent were in 1876-77 under cultivation.\n\nTo the north and north-west the upland, m\u00e1l, is bare of trees and poorly tilled. Towards the south the plain, broken only by the deep cut channel of the Shedhi, is rich and well wooded.\n\nPerhaps because of east winds borne across the forests of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, the climate, though it differs little in temperature or rainfall, is much less healthy than that of the lands further west.\n\nBesides the Mah\u00ed skirting the east and south-east boundary, two branches of the Shedhi, draining the lands to the north and north-east, join near the centre of the sub-division and pass south-west. During this part of its course the waters of the Shedhi flow over a bed of mud between high steep banks. A troublesome crossing at all times, its muddy bottom and strong current make it during the rainy weather almost impassable. The water supply is scanty. Wells and pools do not yield more than is wanted for domestic uses and for cattle; and nothing has yet been done by building dams\nto make use of the sweet wholesome water of the Shedhi. The 18 water-supply figures were 8 wells with steps, 357 wells without steps, 13 waterlifts, dhokudis, 624 ponds and reservoirs, and 78 rivers, streams, and springs.\n\nCompared with Nadiad the soil of Th\u00e1sra is poor. To the north and north-west the upland, m\u00e1l, an inferior black, except where banked into rice fields, yields no valuable crop.

Statistics specially prepared from the enumerators' forms give the following caste details: 5729 Br\u00e2hmans; 10 Brahma-Kshatris; 9 Parbhus; 2470 V\u00e2ni\u00e2s; 2806 Shr\u00e2vaks; 338 Luv\u00e2n\u00e2s; 10,648 Kanbis; 2284 Rajputs; 1602 K\u00e1chhi\u00e2s; 139 M\u00e1lis; 738 Bh\u00e1vs\u00e2rs, calicoprinters; 348 Sonis, gold and silver smiths; 1299 Suth\u00e2rs, carpenters; 670 Luh\u00e2rs, blacksmiths; 355 Darjis, tailors; 75 Chun\u00e1r\u00e2s, bricklayers; 33 Khatris, silk and cotton weavers; 19 Gh\u00e2nc\u00ees, oilpressers; 430 Bh\u00e2ts; 245 Ch\u00e2rans, bards and genealogists; 1 Ghandrap, songster; 1168 Kumbh\u00e2rs, potters; 1355 Haj\u00e2ms, barbers; 141 Dhobhis, washermen; 10 Bhistis, waterdrawers; 1178 Rab\u00e2ris, shepherds; 1754 Bhois, fishers and labourers; 47 Kh\u00e2rv\u00e2s, seamen; 44 Gol\u00e2s, ricepounders; 8 Bh\u00e2dbhuj\u00e2s, grainpachers; 213 Mara-th\u00e2s; 674 V\u00e2ghris, fowlers and hunters; 1206 R\u00e2vali\u00e2s, cotton tape-makers; 31,775 Kolis; 375 Mochis, shoemakers; 1342 Ch\u00e2madi\u00e2s, tanners; 27 Baj\u00e2ni\u00e2s, acrobats; 12 Kal\u00e2ls, liquor sellers; 270 Ods, diggers; 66 B\u00e2vch\u00e2s, labourers; 4150 Dheds; 318 Garud\u00e2s; 1697 Bhangi\u00e2s; and 322 religious beggars. As regards occupation the same return arranges the whole population under the seven following heads: i. Employed under Government or municipal or other local authorities, 916. ii. Professional persons, 450. iii. In service or performing personal offices, 969. iv. Engaged in\nagriculture and with animals, (a) cultivators 16,718 (b) labourers 585, total 17,303. v. Engaged in commerce and trade, 854. vi. Employed in mechanical arts, manufactures, and engineering operations, and engaged in the sale of articles manufactured or otherwise prepared for consumption, 8950. vii. Miscellaneous persons not classed otherwise, (a) women 24,502, and children 30,653, in all 55,155; and (b) miscellaneous persons, 1157; total 56,312.\n\nThe total number of deaths registered in the six years ending 1875-76 was 12,746, or an average yearly mortality of 2124, or on the basis of the 1872 census figures 2\u00b747 per cent of 85,754, the total population of the sub-division. Of the average number of deaths, 1788 or 84\u00b718 per cent were returned as due to fever; 119 or 5\u00b760 per cent, to diarrhoea and dysentery; 16 or 0\u00b775 per cent, to smallpox; 66 or 3\u00b710 per cent, to cholera; and 99 or 4\u00b766 per cent, to miscellaneous diseases. Deaths from accidents and violence averaged 36 or 1\u00b769 per cent of the average mortality of the sub-division. During the same period the births of 11,420 children were registered, 6108 males and 5312 females, or an average yearly birth rate of 1903 or 2\u00b721 per cent of the population.\n\nNadia'd Sub-division.\u2014The Nadi\u00e1d sub-division, situated in the centre of the Kaira district, is bounded on the north by the Kapadvanj, and on the east by the Th\u00e1sra and A'nd sub-divisions. On the south is Petl\u00e1d, a Baroda sub-division, and to the southwest the M\u00e1tar and to the west the Mehm\u00e1dabad sub-divisions. The total area is 223 square miles, and the population, according to the census of 1872, 151,483 souls, or an average density of 679\u00b729 to the square mile. In 1876-77 the realizable land revenue amounted to \u00a334,863 (Rs. 3,48,630).\n\nOf the total area of 223 square miles, 7 are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder, according to the revenue survey returns, contains 121,359 acres or 87\u00b778 per cent, of occupied land; 2675 acres or 1\u00b793 per cent, of culturable waste; 7034 acres or 5\u00b708 per cent, of unculturable waste; and 7183 acres, or 5\u00b719 per cent, of roads, river beds, ponds, and village sites. From 124,034 acres, 66,791 have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages. Of the balance of 57,243 acres, the actual area of culturable Government land, 49,056 or 85\u00b769 per cent were in the year 1876-77 under cultivation.\n\nIts level surface broken by few undulations, its well grown groves of fruit and timber trees, its hedge bound and highly tilled fields, and its large strongly built villages, show Nadi\u00e1d to be one of the richest parts of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nThe climate is healthy; but except in the south and south-west, where sea breezes blow from the Gulf of Cambay, the heat during the months of March and April is excessive.\n\nThe river Shedhi entering from the east passes through the sub-division on its way to join the S\u00e1barmati. Near the centre of its course it is from the north joined by the Mohar, and the united stream passes westward, winding between steep banks to join the\nV\u00e1trak. Except in unusually dry seasons when their water stands in pools, the streams of the Shedhi and Mohar flow throughout the year. Still the supply is scanty. The water of the Shedhi and Mohar carrying in solution some injurious salt is unfit for irrigation; the want of clay in the soil makes storage in reservoirs difficult, and the supply from wells, though plentiful and near the surface, is brackish. The 1876 water-supply figures were 26 wells with steps, 2062 wells without steps, 918 ponds and reservoirs, and 64 rivers, streams, and springs.\n\nExcept some rice lands of medium-black, besar, the whole subdivision is a light, gorat, soil very rich and most carefully worked. Besides the ordinary grains and pulses, Nadi\u00e1d produces all the better kinds of crops both early and late. The chief rainy season, kharif, crops are rice, tobacco, Indian millet, pulses, and several of the coarser grains. The cold weather, rabi, harvest is wheat and late tobacco, and the hot weather, hari, harvest late millet, pulse, and gram. In the best garden lands ginger, safflower, tobacco, turmeric, and sugarcane are grown.\n\nThe following statement shows the arable area in Government villages, and the rates fixed in 1865-66:\n\n**Nadi\u00e1d Rent-roll, 1865-66.**\n\n| TENGUE. | OCCUPIED. | UNOCCUPIED. | TOTAL. |\n|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|\n|         | Acres.    | Rupee Assessment. | Average acre rate. | Acres. | Rupee Assessment. | Average acre rate. | Acres. | Rupee Assessment. | Average acre rate. |\n| ARABLE LAND. |           | Rs. a. p. |           | Rs. a. p. |           | Rs. a. p. |           | Rs. a. p. |           |\n| Government. | Dry crop | 42,911 | 1,48,899 | 3 7 6 | 2649 | 6489 | 2 1 2 | 45,560 | 1,55,388 | 3 10 5 |\n| Garden | 4580 | 44,100 | 9 10 1 | 2 | 20 | 10 4 0 | 4582 | 44,120 | 9 10 1 |\n| Rice | 7077 | 37,361 | 5 4 5 | 24 | 116 | 4 13 1 | 7101 | 37,467 | 5 4 6 |\n| Total | 54,568 | 2,30,360 | 4 3 6 | 2875 | 6625 | 2 7 7 | 57,243 | 2,36,975 | 4 2 3 |\n| Alienated. | Dry crop | 52,508 | 1,90,652 | 3 9 6 | ... | ... | ... | 52,508 | 1,90,652 | 3 9 6 |\n| Garden | 6235 | 51,814 | 8 4 11 | ... | ... | ... | 6235 | 51,814 | 8 4 11 |\n| Rice | 9050 | 42,374 | 5 4 2 | ... | ... | ... | 9050 | 42,374 | 5 4 2 |\n| Total | 66,791 | 2,84,840 | 4 4 3 | ... | ... | ... | 66,791 | 2,84,840 | 4 4 3 |\n| Total. | Dry crop | 95,417 | 3,28,551 | 3 8 11 | 2649 | 6489 | 2 1 2 | 98,066 | 3,46,940 | 3 8 5 |\n| Garden | 10,816 | 95,914 | 8 13 4 | 2 | 20 | 10 4 0 | 10,817 | 95,934 | 8 13 11 |\n| Rice | 15,127 | 79,725 | 5 4 3 | 24 | 116 | 4 13 1 | 15,151 | 79,841 | 5 4 4 |\n| Grand Total | 131,359 | 5,15,190 | 4 3 11 | 2875 | 6625 | 2 7 7 | 124,034 | 5,21,815 | 4 3 4 |\n\nRs. a. p. \u00a3 s. d.\n\nAssessment on Government and alienated land | 5,21,815 | 0 0 | 52,181 | 10 0\nDeduct\u2014Alienations | ... | ... | 2,84,839 | 15 0 | 28,483 | 19 10\u00bd\n\nRemains | ... | ... | 2,36,975 | 1 0 | 23,697 | 10 1\u00bd\nAdd\u2014Quitrents | ... | ... | 1,32,099 | 8 0 | 13,209 | 19 0\n,, Grazing farms and river-bed tillage | ... | ... | 12,248 | 12 8 | 1224 | 17 7\n\nTotal revenue | 3,81,323 | 5 8 | 38,132 | 6 8\u00bc\nChapter XIII.\n\nSub-divisions.\n\nNADIA'.\n\nStock, 1876-77.\n\nHoldings.\n\nThe rates of assessment introduced in 1862-63 remain in force till 1891-92.\n\nThe 1872 population, 151,483 souls lodged in 46,608 houses, were in 1876-77 supplied with 2088 wells and 918 ponds, and owned 9774 ploughs, 6661 carts, 22,009 oxen, 3938 cows, 30,925 buffaloes, 344 horses, 9093 sheep and goats, 1450 asses, and 44 camels.\n\nIn 1865-66, the year of settlement, 20,628 distinct holdings, kh\u00e1t\u00e1s, were recorded, with an average area of $5\\frac{4}{5}$ acres, and a rental of \u00a31 15s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 17-9-2). Equally divided among the agricultural population these holdings would, for each person, represent an allotment of $1\\frac{2}{5}$ acres at a yearly rent of 9s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 4-13-3). If distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the share per head would amount to $1\\frac{2}{5}$ acres, and the incidence of the land tax to 6s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-2-10).\n\nProduce.\n\nIn 1876-77, of 49,056 acres, the total area of cultivated land 2985 or 6\u00b708 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 46,071 acres, 1661 were twice cropped. Of the 47,732 acres under actual cultivation, grain crops occupied 38,022 or 79\u00b765 per cent, 14,440 of them under b\u00e1jri, Penicillaria spicata; 6814 under rice, d\u00e1ngr, Oryza sativa; 5641 under b\u00e1rt\u00e1, Panicum frumentaceum; 5598 under j\u00fav\u00e1r, Sorghum vulgare; 5012 under kodra, Paspalum scrobiculatum; and 517 under miscellaneous cereals comprising wheat, ghan, Triticum aestivum; barley, jar, Hordeum hexastichon; maize, mak\u00e1i, Zea mays; k\u00e1ng, Panicum italicum; and r\u00e1jgara, Amaranthus paniculatus.

Oil seeds occupied 359 acres or 0\u00b775 per cent, 40 of them under tal, Sesamum indicum; and 319 under other oil seeds, details of which are not available. Fibres occupied 225 acres or 0\u00b747 per cent, 199 of them under cotton, kup\u00e1s, Gossypium herbaceum; and 26 under Bombay hemp, son, Crotalaria juncea. Miscellaneous crops occupied 4876 acres or 10\u00b721 per cent, 267 of them under surgarcane, serdi, Saccharum officinarum; 301 under safflower, kasumba, Carthamus tinctorius; 3618 under tobacco, tamb\u00e1ku, Nicotiana tabacum; and 690 under miscellaneous vegetables and fruits.\n\nPeople, 1872.\n\nThe 1872 census returns show of a total population of 151,483 souls 133,767 or 88\u00b730 per cent, Hindus; 17,701 or 11\u00b768 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns; and 15 P\u00e1rsis. Statistics specially prepared from the enumerators' forms give the following caste details: 9391 Br\u00e1hmans; 64 Brahma-Kshatr\u00eds; 8 Parbhus; 7 K\u00e1yasths; 5587 V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s; 699 Shr\u00edvaks; 200 Lov\u00e1n\u00e1s; 31739 Kambis; 2632 Rajputs; 1308 K\u00e1chhi\u00e1s; 241 M\u00e1lis; 718 Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs, calicoprinters; 624 Son\u00eds, gold and silver smiths; 407 Kans\u00e1ras, brass and copper smiths; 1163 Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 2065 Suth\u00e1rs, carpenters; 189 Kadi\u00e1s, bricklayers.\n10 Sal\u00e1ts, masons; 6 Gh\u00e1nchis, oil pressers; 7 Khatris, silk and cotton weavers; 1943 Bh\u00e1ts, bards; 90 Ch\u00e1rans, bards and genealogists; 8 Ghandhraps, songsters; 518 Darjis, tailors; 1687 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 2086 Haj\u00e1ms, barbers; 215 Dhobhis, washermen; 603 Bharv\u00e1ds and Rab\u00e1ris, herdsmen and shepherds; 2071 M\u00e1chhis, fishermen; 348 Gol\u00e1s, ricepounders; 18 Bh\u00e1dbhuj\u00e1s, grainparchers; 54 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; 3363 V\u00e1ghris, fowlers and hunters; 46,380 Kol\u00eds; 617 Mochis, shoemakers; 1720 Ch\u00e1madi\u00e1s, tanners; 169 Baj\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, acrobats; 36 Kal\u00e1l\u00e1s, liquor sellers; 110 Sindhv\u00e1s; 90 Turis; 12,003 Dheds and Bhangi\u00e1s; and 2612 religious beggars. As regards occupation the same return arranges the whole population under the seven following classes: i. Employed under Government or municipal or other local authorities, 981. ii. Professional persons, 1084. iii. In service or performing personal offices, 981. iv. Engaged in agriculture and with animals, (a) cultivators 32,125 (b) labourers 547, total 32,672. v. Engaged in commerce and trade, 2057. vi. Employed in mechanical arts, manufactures, and engineering operations, and engaged in the sale of articles manufactured or otherwise prepared for consumption, 10,002. vii. Miscellaneous persons not classed otherwise, (a) women 45,935, and children 54,638, in all 100,573; and (b) miscellaneous persons, 3133; total 103,706.\n\nThe total number of deaths registered in the five years ending 1874-75 was 19,315, or an average yearly mortality of 3863, or on the basis of the 1872 census figures 2\u00b755 per cent of 151,483, the total population of the sub-division. Of the average number of deaths, 25\u00b794 or 67\u00b714 per cent were returned as due to fever; 597 or 15\u00b745 per cent, to diarrhoea and dysentery; 99 or 2\u00b756 per cent, to smallpox; 134 or 3\u00b746 per cent, to cholera; and 385 or 9\u00b796 per cent, to miscellaneous diseases. Deaths from accidents and violence averaged 54 or 1\u00b739 per cent of the average mortality of the sub-division. During the same period the births of 15,774 children were registered, 8401 males and 7373 females, or an average yearly birth rate of 3155 or 2\u00b708 per cent of the population.\n\nMa'tar Sub-division.\u2014The M\u00e1tar sub-division is bounded on the north by Daskroi and Mehmadabad, on the east by Nadi\u00e1d and some G\u00e1ikw\u00e1ri villages, on the south by Cambay, and on the west by the S\u00e1barmati river. Besides the main body of the sub-division are some isolated villages cut off from the rest by belts of Baroda and Cambay territory. The total area is 215 square miles, and the population, according to the census of 1872, 78,673 souls, or an average density of 365\u00b792 to the square mile. In 1876-77 the realizable land revenue amounted to \u00a326,772 (Rs. 2,67,720).\n\nOf the total area of 215 square miles, 14 are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder, according to the revenue survey returns, contains 99,888 acres or 77\u00b757 per cent, of occupied land; 14,352 acres or 11\u00b714 per cent, of culturable waste; 8235 acres, or 6\u00b739 per cent, of unculturable waste; and 6296 acres or 4\u00b788 per cent, of roads, ponds, river beds, and village sites. From 114,240 acres, 59,499 have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages. Of the balance of 54,741 acres the actual area of\nculturable Government land, 37,901 or 69\u00b723 per cent were in the year 1876-77 under cultivation.\n\nSlightly undulating in the north-east corner, the country is for the most part level. In many places closely hedgebound and wooded, it stretches southwards in large open black-soil plains intersected near the Gulf of Cambay by tracts of salt marsh.\n\nOwing to its flatness and the want of natural drainage, the climate of M\u00e1tar is oppressive in the hot season and feverish during the rains. The rainfall at the town of Kaira, nearly the centre of the sub-division, averaged during the five years ending 1877 twenty-eight inches.\n\nThere are two rivers in M\u00e1tar. The S\u00e1barmati skirts its western boundary, and the Shedhi entering from the north-east, and receiving from the north the waters of the V\u00e1trak, winds westward through the centre of the sub-division. The water supply is abundant. Besides the rivers, which by the help of lever-lifts water the lands of several villages, there are many reservoirs; some of them very large, particularly those at Bhal\u00e1da, Tr\u00e1j, and Ch\u00e1nor. Wells, both temporary and permanent, are also numerous and water a large area of garden land. The 1876 water-supply figures were 6 wells with steps, 1152 wells without steps, 3 masonry and 1 earthen river dam, 372 water lifts, dhekudis, 456 ponds or reservoirs, 5 canals, and 58 rivers, streams, and springs.\n\nMost of the M\u00e1tar lands are of medium-light, gor\u00e1dy, not so rich as in Borsad and Nadi\u00e1d, but less sandy than the soils to the north of the S\u00e1barmati. Besides the light lands there are medium-black, black, and alluvial tracts. The medium-black, bes\u00e1r, of the sort known as ky\u00e1rda or rice land, though in small quantities, is pretty widespread. The black is found over a large area, especially in the villages along the north bank of the Shedhi and in a tract stretching from Radu southward to Ch\u00e1nor. Though not so rich as the Broach black soil, much of it yields heavy crops of unwatered wheat. The area of alluvial, bh\u00e1tha, soil is small, but particularly on the V\u00e1trak to the south of Kaira it is of very high quality.\n\nThe following statement shows the arable area in Government villages, and the rates fixed in 1862-63:\n\nM\u00e1tar Rent-roll, 1862-63.\n\n| Tenant | Arable Land | Occupied | Unoccupied | Total |\n|--------|-------------|----------|------------|-------|\n|        | Acres       | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate Rs. a. p. | Acres | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate Rs. a. p. | Acres | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate Rs. a. p. |\n| Govt.  |             |           |            |       |                 |                        |       |                 |                        |\n| Dry crop | 27,682     | 85,933    | 3 1 8      | 10,429 | 23,789          | 2 4 6                  | 38,111 | 1,00,722         | 2 14 1               |\n| Garden | 1831       | 9982      | 5 4 11     | 227   | 942             | 4 2 5                  | 2108  | 10,042           | 6 10 11              |\n| Rice   | 10,826     | 72,020    | 6 10 5     | 3698  | 24,725          | 6 11 1                 | 14,522 | 26,745           | 6 10 7               |\n| Total  | 40,389     | 1,67,055  | 4 2 6      | 14,552 | 48,456          | 3 7 2                  | 54,741 | 2,17,301         | 3 15 4               |\n### M\u0101tar Rent-roll, 1862-63\u2014continued.\n\n| TENURE | ARABLE LAND | OCCUPIED | UNOCCUPIED ARABLE WASTE | TOTAL |\n|--------|-------------|----------|-------------------------|-------|\n|        | Acres       | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate Rs. a. p. | Acres | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate Rs. a. p. |\n| Alienated |             |           |                         |       |                 |                         |\n| Dry crop | 44,749      | 1,49,963  | 3 5 7                   |       |                 |                         |\n| Garden   | 3900        | 15,627    | 4 11 7                  |       |                 |                         |\n| Rice     | 10,844      | 74,395    | 6 13 9                  |       |                 |                         |\n| Total    | 59,499      | 2,42,399  | 4 1 4                   |       |                 |                         |\n|          |             |           |                         |       |                 |                         |\n| Total    |             |           |                         |       |                 |                         |\n| Dry crop | 72,431      | 2,35,896  | 2 4 1                   |       |                 |                         |\n| Garden   | 5787        | 25,509    | 4 14 10                 |       |                 |                         |\n| Rice     | 21,670      | 1,43,418  | 6 12 1                  |       |                 |                         |\n| Grand Total | 99,888    | 4,10,823  | 4 1 9                   |       |                 |                         |\n\n| Rs. a. p. | \u00a3. s. d. |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Assessment on Government and alienated land | 4,60,278 10 1 | 46,027 17 3\u00bd |\n| Deduct\u2014Alienations | 2,42,887 9 9 | 24,288 15 2\u00be |\n| Remains | 2,17,391 0 4 | 21,739 2 0\u00bc |\n| Add\u2014Quitrents | 73,372 4 5 | 7337 4 6\u00be |\n| \u2014Grazing farms and river-bed tillage | 23,617 1 8 | 2381 14 2\u00bd |\n| Total revenue | 3,14,580 6 5 | 31,458 0 9\u00bd |\n\nThe rates of assessment introduced in 1862-63 remain in force till 1891-92.\n\nThe 1872 population, 78,673 souls lodged in 25,752 houses, were in 1876-77 supplied with 1158 wells and 456 ponds, and owned 5996 ploughs, 2742 carts, 14,760 oxen, 5789 cows, 19,391 buffaloes, 372 horses, 5370 sheep and goats, and 698 asses.\n\nIn 1862-63, the year of settlement, 15,086 holdings, kh\u00e1t\u00e1s, were recorded, with an average area of $6\\frac{2}{4}$ acres, and a rental of \u00a31 12s.

A'nand is a new sub-division formed in 1867 of villages taken from the Nadi\u00e1d, Mahudha, Th\u00e1sra, and Borsad sub-divisions. The total area is 241 square miles, and the population, according to the census of 1872, 149,952 souls, or an average density of 622\u00b720 to the square mile. In 1876-77 the realizable land revenue amounted to \u00a337,858 (Rs. 3,78,580).\n\nOf the total area of 241 square miles, 17 are occupied by the lands of alienated and unsettled, mehw\u00e1si, villages. The remainder, according to the revenue survey returns, contains 124,542 acres or 86\u00b763 per cent, of occupied land; 2964 acres or 2\u00b706 per cent, of culturable waste; 9796 acres or 6\u00b781 per cent, of unculturable waste; and 6451 acres or 4\u00b748 per cent, of roads, river beds, ponds, and village sites. From 127,506 acres 56,043 have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages. Of the balance of 71,463 acres, the actual area of culturable Government land, 60,140 or 84\u00b715 per cent were in 1876-77 under cultivation.\n\nExcept towards the east near the Mahi where the land is bare of trees, uneven, and seamed with deep ravines, the whole is a flat, rich plain of light soil, well tilled, and richly wooded.\n\nIn almost all respects the climate of A'nand is like the climate of Nadi\u00e1d.\n\nThe water supply is scanty. Wells are few, as they have to be sunk to a great depth, and their supplies suffice only for domestic uses. The reservoirs are small, shallow and leaky. The 1876 water supply figures are, 8 wells with steps, 1317 wells without steps, 822 ponds and reservoirs, and 12 rivers, streams, and springs.\n\nExcept patches of black loam found in lowlying spots the soil is light, rich towards the north, and poorer and more sandy in the villages near the Mahi.\n\nThe following statement made to take in the parts of Borsad, Nadi\u00e1d, Th\u00e1sra, and Mahudha, joined together in 1867, shows the area of arable land in the Government villages of the present sub-division and the rates fixed between 1863 and 1867:\n\n| **A'nand Rent-roll, 1863-1867.** |\n|----------------------------------|\n| **TENURE.** | **ARABLE LAND.** | **OCCUPIED.** | **UNOCCUPIED.** | **TOTAL.** |\n| | Acres. | Rupee Assessment. | Average acre rate, Rs. a. p. | Acres. | Rupee Assessment. | Average acre rate, Rs. a. p. | Acres. | Rupee Assessment. | Average acre rate, Rs. a. p. |\n| Government. | | | | | | | | | |\n| Dry crop... | 55,824 | 2,08,920 | 3 8 10 | 2953 | 7417 | 2 8 2 | 61,777 | 2,16,337 | 3 8 0 |\n| Garden... | 4412 | 39,011 | 8 13 6 | 3 | 99 | 36 2 11 | 4415 | 39,110 | 8 13 9 |\n| Rice... | 5263 | 38,818 | 5 7 7 | 8 | 43 | 5 3 9 | 5271 | 28,861 | 5 7 7 |\n| Total... | 68,499 | 2,76,749 | 4 0 8 | 2964 | 7559 | 2 8 10 | 71,463 | 2,84,808 | 3 15 6 |\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XIII.**\n\n**Sub-divisions.**\n\n**A'nand.**\n\n**Area.**\n\n**Aspect.**\n\n**Climate.**\n\n**Water.**\n\n**Soil.**\n\n**Rental, 1863-1867.**\nThe rates of assessment introduced between 1863 and 1867 remain in force till 1891-92.\n\nThe 1872 population, 149,952 souls lodged in 40,988 houses, were in 1876-77 supplied with 1325 wells and 822 ponds, and owned 8851 ploughs, 5982 carts, 20,696 oxen, 2917 cows, 41,222 buffaloes, 282 horses, 7205 sheep and goats, 1106 asses, and 5 camels.\n\nAt the time (1863-1867) of settlement, 17,087 holdings, kh\u00e1t\u00e1s, were recorded, with an average area of \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\) acres, and a rental of \u00a32 3s. \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)d.

During the same period the births of 14,323 children were registered, 7695 males and 6628 females, or an average yearly birth rate of 2864 or 1\u00b790 per cent of the population.\n\n**Borsad Sub-division.**\u2014The Borsad sub-division, bounded on the north by A'hand, on the east and south by the Mahi river, and on the west by the Cambay and Baroda states, is owing to the intermixture of Baroda and other villages, most broken and irregular in shape. The total area is 216 square miles, and the population, according to the census of 1872, 144,528 souls, or an average density of 669\u00b711 to the square mile. In 1876-77 the realizable land revenue amounted to \u00a337,698 (Rs. 3,76,980).\n\n**Area.**\n\nOf the total area of 216 square miles, 56 are occupied by the lands of alienated and unsettled, *mehv\u00e1s*, villages. The remainder contains according to the revenue survey returns, 92,901 acres or 90\u00b733 per cent, of occupied land; 2597 acres or 2\u00b752 per cent, of culturable waste; 2953 acres or 2\u00b787 per cent, of unculturable waste; and 4389 acres or 4\u00b726 per cent, of roads, river-beds, ponds, and village-sites. From 95,498 acres 40,698 have to be taken on account of alienated lands in Government villages. Of the balance of 54,800 acres, the actual area of culturable Government land, 49,035 or 89\u00b747 per cent were in 1876-77 under cultivation.\n\n**Aspect.**\n\nExcept in the south near the Mahi where the ground is somewhat broken and wild, the whole is a highly cultivated plain sloping gently westwards, intersected by rich hedgerows and adorned by groves of magnificent trees.\n\n**Climate.**\n\nOccasionally during the hot season the heat is extreme, the thermometer standing as high as 105\u00b0 in the shade. But such days are unusual, and as a rule the heat is tempered by a cool breeze from the Gulf of Cambay.\n\n**Water.**\n\nThe Mahi forming the southern boundary is throughout the whole distance a tidal river. The shallowness of its channel, its shifting sandbanks, and the height and speed of its tidal wave, make it useless for boats. Except the Mahi, Borsad is without streams or water courses and the light unretentive soil is illsuited to the storage of water in reservoirs. Still the supply is good, there are many wells yielding enough to water 11 per cent of the whole occupied area. The water-supply figures are, 4 wells with steps, 1914 wells without steps, 807 ponds, and 17 rivers, streams, and springs.\n\n**Soil.**\n\nAbout a tenth part of the culturable area is blackish rice-land. The rest is a deep stratum of light soil occasionally sandy, but for the most part a fine rich mould.\n\n**Rental, 1867.**\n\nThe following statement shows the arable area in Government villages, and the rates fixed in 1866-67:\n### Borsad Rent-roll, 1866-67.\n\n| Tenant | Occupied | Unoccupied | Total |\n|--------|----------|------------|-------|\n|        | Acres    | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate | Acres | Rupee Assessment | Average acre rate |\n|        |          | Rs. a. p.   | Rs. a. p.         |       | Rs. a. p.   | Rs. a. p.         |\n| Govt.  |          |            |                  |       |            |                  |\n| Dry crop | 40,436  | 1,72,772   | 4 4 4            | 2540  | 7682      | 3 0 3            |\n| Garden  | 7838    | 60,100     | 7 10 8           |       | 7838      | 60,100           |\n| Rice    | 3929    | 26,447     | 6 7 7            | 57    | 241       | 4 4 0            |\n| Total   | 52,203  | 2,58,319   | 4 15 2           | 2597  | 7903      | 3 0 8            |\n|         |          |            |                  |       | 54,800    | 2,66,222         |\n|         |          |            |                  |       |            | 4 13 8           |\n| Alienated |        |            |                  |       |            |                  |\n| Dry crop | 35,942  | 1,55,349   | 4 5 2            |       | 35,942    | 1,55,349         |\n| Garden  | 2987    | 23,693     | 8 1 0            |       | 2327      | 23,693           |\n| Rice    | 1819    | 11,006     | 6 6 0            |       | 1819      | 11,006           |\n| Total   | 40,698  | 1,90,668   | 4 10 11          |       | 40,698    | 1,90,668         |\n|         |          |            |                  |       |            | 4 10 11          |\n| Total   | 92,901  | 4,48,987   | 4 13 3           | 2597  | 7903      | 3 0 8            |\n|         |          |            |                  |       | 95,498    | 4,56,890         |\n|         |          |            |                  |       |            | 4 12 8           |\n\n**Rs. a. p.**\n\nAssessment on Government and alienated land... 4,56,890 0 1\n\nDeduct\u2014Alienations ... ... ... 1,90,667 9 10\n\nRemainder ... ... ... ... ... 2,66,222 6 3\n\nAdd\u2014Quitrents ... ... ... ... ... 76,031 11 0\n\n,, Grazing farms and river-bed tillage ... ... ... ... ... 44,864 8 10\n\nTotal revenue ... ... ... ... ... 3,87,118 10 1\n\nThe rates of assessment introduced in 1866-67 remain in force till 1891-92.\n\nThe 1872 population, 144,528 souls lodged in 34,079 houses, were in 1876-77 supplied with 1918 wells and 807 ponds and owned 8386 ploughs, 5370 carts, 17,668 oxen, 3275 cows, 45,635 buffaloes, 440 horses, 10,441 sheep and goats, 1610 asses, and 38 camels.\n\nIn 1866-67, the year of settlement, 9191 holdings, *kh\u00e1t\u00e1s*, were recorded, with an average area of $10\\frac{4}{5}$ acres, and a rental of \u00a33 12s. 9\u00bdd. (Rs. 36-6-1). Equally divided among the agricultural population these holdings would, for each person, represent an allotment of $1\\frac{4}{5}$ acres at a yearly rent of 10s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 5-1-10). If distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the share per head would amount to $1\\frac{4}{5}$ acres, and the incidence of the land tax to 7s. 5d. (Rs. 3-11-4).\n\nIn 1876-77 of 49,035 acres, the total area of cultivated land, 2098 or 4\u00b728 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 46,937 acres, 911 were twice cropped. Of the 47,848 acres under actual cultivation, grain crops occupied 37,240 or 77\u00b782 per cent, 14,187 of them under *b\u00e1ri*, *Penicillaria spicata*; 11,504 under *kodra*, *Paspalum scrobiculatum*; 5850 under *juv\u00e1r*, *Sorghum vulgare*;\n3588 under rice, *d\u00e1ngar*, Oryza sativa; 2010 under *b\u00e1vta*, Panicum frumentaceum; and 101 under miscellaneous cereals comprising wheat, *ghau*, Triticum aestivum; barley, *jav*, Hordeum hexastichon; *k\u00e1ng*, Panicum italicum; and *r\u00e1jgara*, Amaranthus paniculatus.

Of the average number of deaths, 1289 or 67\u00b798 per cent were returned as due to fever; 242 or 12\u00b776 per cent, to diarrhoea and dysentery; 61 or 3\u00b722 per cent, to smallpox; 35, or 1\u00b784 per cent, to cholera; and 246 or 12\u00b797 per cent, to miscellaneous diseases. Deaths from accidents and violence averaged 23 or 1\u00b721 per cent of the average mortality of the sub-division. During the same period the births of 10,066 children were registered, 5468 males and 4598 females, or an average yearly birth rate of 1677 or 1\u00b716 per cent of the population.\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST.\n\nA'nand, north lat. 22\u00b0 33'; east long. 73\u00b0 0', a station on the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway, had in 1872 2309 houses and a population of 8773 souls. Besides the ordinary subdivisional revenue and police offices the town is provided with a post office.\n\nA'ra's. The plain of A'ra's between A'nand and the Mahi has, in modern times, been the scene of three important battles. At the first of these (1723) Rustam Ali the Imperial Governor of Surat was, through the treachery of Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, defeated and slain by H\u00e1mid Kh\u00e1n the deputy of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk. At the second (1775, February) Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v Peshwa was defeated by Fatchsingh G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. At the third, a few months later (1775, May 18th), Fatchsingh's victorious army was, after a severe struggle, defeated by a British detachment under the command of Colonel Keatinge. Of the third battle of A'ra's Mr. Forbes who was present gives the following details. The enemies' cannon silenced and their cavalry dispersed by the British artillery, a party was sent forward to take their guns. While a strong force of cavalry opposed this party's advance, a body of Mar\u00e1tha troops professing to be partisans of Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v the English ally, was allowed to pass between the advanced party and the main British line. Attacked both in front and rear the forward party resisted bravely till the grenadiers, facing to the right-about to change ground, by some mistake began to retreat. The rest followed and at the same time a tumbril of shells blowing up added to the confusion. The men retreated at first in order, but getting broken at a high hedge fled to the main line. The enemy followed but were met by so steady a fire of grape shot and shell that they were driven off the ground. The British were left masters of the field and a gun that had fallen into the enemies' hand was retaken. The engagement lasted for four hours. Victory was dearly bought. Of fifteen British officers in the advanced division seven were killed and four wounded. Eighty Europeans, a number of native officers and 200 men were killed or missing.\u00b9\n\nBorsad, north lat. 22\u00b0 24'; east long. 72\u00b0 56', a town twelve miles west of the V\u00e1sad railway station and twenty-four miles northeast of the port of Cambay had in 1872 4092 houses and a population of 12,214 souls. The town is protected by a double line of fortification.\n\n\u00b9 Forbes' Or. Mem. II. 97 and 98.\nthe outer in disrepair, the inner in fair preservation. Though, according to tradition, Borsad dates back to a certain R\u00e1ja N\u00e1l in the fourth century A.D., the fortifications are modern built by Rangoji, one of the Mar\u00e1tha leaders who in 1741 fixed his headquarters at Borsad. The fort of Borsad was pretty constantly the scene of fighting till in 1748, after a siege of five months, Khand\u00e9r\u00e1v G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r took the town and made Rangoji prisoner. For the last thirty years a Presbyterian missionary has been settled at Borsad. He has succeeded in bringing together a Christian community of 1166 souls. Besides the ordinary sub-divisional revenue and police offices the town of Borsad is provided with a subordinate judge\u2019s court, a post office, and a dispensary. There were in 1878 three Government schools with an average attendance of 270 pupils.\n\nChakla\u2019si, north lat. 22\u00b0 39\u2019; east long. 72\u00b0 59\u2019, a town in the Nadi\u00e1d sub-division had in 1872 1980 houses and a population of 7081 souls.\n\nD\u00e1kor, north lat. 22\u00b0 45\u2019; east long. 73\u00b0 11\u2019, a favourite place of Hindu pilgrimage in the Th\u00e1sra sub-division on the P\u00e1li branch of the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway. It has a further interest as the spot where in 1732 Pil\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r was assassinated by the emissaries of Abh\u00e9singh viceroy of Gujar\u00e1t.\u00b9 It had in 1872, 2657 houses and a population of 7740 souls, and in 1878 a municipal revenue of \u00a31981 (Rs. 19,810). It is provided with a post office and a dispensary.\n\nThe object of worship is an image of Krishna or Ranchodji brought to D\u00e1kor from Dw\u00e1rka in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. About the year 1155 there lived in D\u00e1kor a certain R\u00e1md\u00e1s otherwise known as Bodh\u00e1no, by caste a Kshatri. A strict devotee of Krishna, this Bodh\u00e1no allowed a plant of sweet basil to grow from the palm of one of his hands. With this as his offering he used twice a year to make a pilgrimage from D\u00e1kor to Krishna\u2019s shrine at Dw\u00e1rka. At length Bodh\u00e1no grew old and the god, seeing that he would not long be able to pay his half-yearly visit, allowed his votary to take the Dw\u00e1rka image and carry it with him to his home in D\u00e1kor. Delighted with this mark of Krishna\u2019s favour Bodh\u00e1no seized the image and made good his escape from Dw\u00e1rka. When the news spread that the god was gone the priests in hot pursuit, overtaking Bodh\u00e1no as he reached D\u00e1kor, slew him with an arrow. With a last effort Bodh\u00e1no hurled the image into the D\u00e1kor lake and the priests failing in their pursuit sat fasting by the water side. Taking pity on the strangers, Bodh\u00e1no\u2019s widow prayed the god to make known his hiding place. The god granted her prayer, telling her at the same time not to part with the image but to offer the priests its weight in gold. The priests accepted the offer, and when the time for weighing came, the woman trusting to the god threw into the balance all the gold she had, a light nose-ring. This by the favour of the god weighed down the scale. Disappointed of their hope of gain the priests refused to abide by their bargain;\n\n\u00b9 Watson\u2019s His, of Gujar\u00e1t, 110.\nnor would they leave until they had exacted from the god a promise that on their return to Dw\u00e1rka they should find hid in a well an image the same as the one they had lost.\n\nThe chief objects of interest at D\u00e1kor are the lake and the temple where the image of Krishna is enshrined. The lake is the largest in the Kaira district provided on three sides with a masonry wall and flights of stone steps. The temple was built in 1772 at a cost of about \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000), by Gop\u00e1l Jagann\u00e1th T\u00e1mbekar a native of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and banker to the Peshwa. The enclosure, entered by gateways on the north and west, is round, paved with stone and girt with walls and outhouses. The temple with brick walls and stone pillars raised on a high plinth approached on all sides by a flight of twelve stone steps, measures 168 feet from east to west and 151 from north to south and has eight domes and twenty-four turrets, the highest of ninety feet. The inside is richly ornamented; the dome with plates of talc and the doors and gratings with a costly network of silver and glass. The idol\u2019s throne, a beautiful piece of wood carving, has, at a cost of \u00a312,500 (Rs. 1,25,000), lately been covered with gold and silver by H. H. the Ga\u00edkwar. The temple revenues are, besides pilgrim\u2019s presents, a yearly allowance of \u00a3340 (Rs. 3400) together with the rental of the two villages of D\u00e1kor and Kanjri. The ceremonial duties are distributed among a body of priests belonging to three classes, Kh\u00e9d\u00e1val Br\u00e1hmans, Shrigod Br\u00e1hmans, and Tapodhans. Every full moon brings crowds of devotees to D\u00e1kor. But the chief gatherings, with from fifty to a hundred thousand pilgrims, many of them from the Deccan or from distant parts of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war are on the October, \u00c1\u2019so, and November, K\u00e1rtik, full moons. At other full moons the number of pilgrims varies from five to ten thousand chiefly from Kaira and other parts of Gujar\u00e1t. Besides the full moon fairs special gatherings are on three occasions held at D\u00e1kor, in March the F\u00fagan sud ag\u00edr\u00e1as; in June the car-day, rath-j\u00e1tra; and in July-August, Krishna\u2019s birth-day or jama\u00e1shtam\u00ed. These are local gatherings of little importance. On all of these occasions persons of every caste from the Br\u00e1hman to the Dhed attend, the Dheds worshipping at a distance not being allowed to enter the temple. The passenger traffic of D\u00e1kor has increased from 126,060 in 1874 to 284,330 in 1877.\n\nDehva\u2019n, with, in 1872, a population of 3401 souls lodged in 921 houses on the Mahi in the Borsad sub-division, was once a seaport and a place of consequence. Its trade is said to have been destroyed by the competition of Cambay and the shoaling of the river.

Kaira is a very ancient city, according to one story as old as the time of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t (B.C. 1400) when it bore the name of Chakravati Nagari and its king Mordhuj fought and was defeated by the P\u00e1ndavs. The evidence of copperplate grants shows that under the name of Khaidra this town was in existence as early as the fifth century A.D. About a hundred years later it is spoken of as a great city 'the birth-place of Shil\u00e1ditya the conqueror of Valabhi.' In modern Gujar\u00e1t history Kaira holds no prominent place. Early in the eighteenth century the town passed into the hands of the B\u00e1bi family with whom it remained till in 1763 it was taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s under D\u00e1m\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r. In 1775 it was a large town fortified with a brick wall, the buildings almost entirely hid by trees. It was handed over to the British by A'andr\u00e1v G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r in 1803 (May 3). Under the British its position as a frontier station made Kaira a place of some importance. For this reason, and as it was at that time considered one of the healthiest spots in British Gujar\u00e1t, a large body of troops, infantry, cavalry and artillery was collected, and barracks, hospitals, and officers' houses built. Later on (1830?) the transfer of the frontier station to Deesa and the removal of troops to Poona reduced the importance of Kaira as a military station. The climate also seems to have changed for the worse as in 1825 the station, especially the camp, had a name for extreme unhealthiness, the hot weather causing dreadful havoc among the European troops. In 1838 the only corps stationed at Kaira was the Gujar\u00e1t provincial battalion with a strength of 400 men. The cantonment was in ruins, the timber and rafters taken to Deesa to build European barracks. Since the troops have been withdrawn the staff of European officers stationed at Kaira has been reduced to five, the Collector and his assistant, the superintendent of police, the executive engineer, and the civil surgeon. The climate of the station would seem of late years to have again improved. In 1860 and 1864 earthquake shocks, but too slight to cause loss of life or property, were felt. During the last fifty years the population\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 146.\n2 380-385 S\u00e1ka (A.D. 458\u2014463), according to Cunningham Ancient Geography of India, I., 316. The inscriptions are given in J. R. A. S. new series, I., 270-277. The name Khaira is said to come from Ketaka the Sanskrit form of Kend\u00e1 the sweet scented Pandanus, Cal. JL of Science 1838. Sukhad, the confectioners' and Ratanpur the jewellers' quarters, each about two miles from Kaira, are according to local story suburbs of the ancient city.

There were several kings of Valabhi named Shil\u00e1ditya whose dates vary from 421-627. Hiouen-Thsang (630-640) is thought (J. R. A. S. new series VI., II. 272) to have referred to Kaira under the form Kietch\u00e1 or Kita. But the details, a kingdom of 600 miles (3000 li) and a town six miles (20 li) round, about 200 miles south of Vallabhi, do not agree with Kaira. He describes the people as mixed and well-to-do, under M\u00e1la without a separate ruler. There were twelve Buddhist convents and many dozens of Brahman temples and a large number of heretics.\u2014Julien's Life of Hiouen-Thsang, 401-402.\n4 Forbes Or. Mem.

In 1838 it was 12,000; in 1851, 12,091; and in 1872, 12,681, of whom, including 2319 Shravaks, 11,078 were Hindus, 1548 Musalmans, forty Parsis, and fifteen Christians.\n\nKaira has two parts within and without the walls, or the town proper and the suburbs. The town proper may be roughly distributed among five divisions, the north, east, south, west, and central. The north division contains the Girasiavadd or the Girasiyas' quarter, with Rajputs, chiefly cultivators, and a few superior land-holders; the Kalkustekra or the Kaku's hill with Brahman beggars, Vania brokers and money lenders and Kanbi cultivators; the Nani Voharvad or little Bohora ward with Sunni Bohora cotton carders and oil sellers, and Undivad, the low road, with Mochi shoemakers. The east division includes Parmarvad the Parmar Rajput's quarters, chiefly cultivators; Shethwad the merchant's ward, Shravaks chiefy Government servants, and money lenders; Hajamvad the barber ward; and Harikha parekh street with Vania bankers and money lenders. The south division includes Vandariaburaj, the monkey's tower with Kachhia cultivators and brickmakers; Sukulvad or the priests' quarter with Brahman domestic priests and Government servants; Lambiseri, the long street, with Shravak and Vania cloth-sellers, dealers, and money-lenders, and a few Brahman beggars; Bhavsarvad or the calicoprinters' quarter, and Kachhiavad with Kachhia cultivators, bricklayers and vegetable sellers. The west division includes Malivad the gardener's ward with gardeners, tailors, some Brahman beggars and trading Vanias; Moti Voharvad, or great Bohora ward, with Sunni Bohora oil-sellers, cotton carders, and coarse cloth dealers; Vavvad the well ward with Kanbi cultivators and Bhavsar calicoprinters; and Rabarivad the shepherd's ward, with Rabaris, who keep cows, sheep and goats, and live by selling milk and wool, and Shravak brokers and money lenders. The central division includes the town market and the Patelvado where besides the families of the headmen of the town are Shravak shopkeepers, money lenders and a few Government servants; Kolivad, the Kolis' ward with poor cultivators and labourers; Bhatthivado, the brick-kiln ward with cultivators and Brahmins; Syedvad, the Syed's ward with Musalman cultivators and Government messengers; Vaidvad, the doctors' ward with Brahmins formerly medical practitioners now beggars, and Jrola tekro, the Jrola's hill with money lenders of the Jrola Vania caste.\n\nOutside of the town walls are seven suburbs three to the south, two to the east and one each to the north and west. The three south suburbs are Amkupura, called after Amkabai the sister of Tikaji Gaikwar, with Kachhia cultivators and brickmakers, and Momma Musalman weavers; Vagheshvari the tiger god's quarter with Marvadi low class labourers, gamblers and prostitutes; Dhedvad or the Dheds' ward, most of them coarse cloth weavers. The two east suburbs are the Bavchavad, the Bavchas' ward with Bavcha grass sellers and labourers, and Bhangidvad, the Bhangias' ward with Bhangia sweepers and Khalpa leather dressers. The north suburb is Bhoivad, the Bhois' ward with fishermen, cultivators and palanquin\nbearers. The west suburb Lakmanpura, is a small hamlet of Koli labourers and cultivators.\n\nKaira is a place of little trade and, except the weaving, dyeing and printing of cotton cloth, of no manufactures.\n\nThough so old a town Kaira is wanting in remains. Large bricks about eighteen inches square and three inches thick, found from time to time in the bed of the V\u00e1trak and in digging foundations in the town, are almost the only relics. Of objects of interest there are the town walls built of brick probably about the year 1730 by Muhammad Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi then governor of the town. Repairs were provided for by a special cess known as the m\u00e1sv\u00e1ri vero. This yielding about \u00a3160 (Rs. 1600) a year was continued till in 1837 the town walls were rebuilt, the m\u00e1sv\u00e1ri cess given up and town duties levied in its stead. Near the centre of the town is the court-house, a handsome building with Greek pillars. Near the court is the old jail, in 1814 the scene of a riot in which fifty-seven prisoners rose and tried to force their way out. Before the mutiny was suppressed nineteen were killed and twelve wounded. Not far from the court house is a Jain temple with some beautiful dark wood carving. Outside of the east gate is the jail with room for about 150 prisoners. Outside of the south gate are the reading-room and library with a well-proportioned clock tower built in 1868. A hundred yards beyond on the further bank of the V\u00e1trak stands the Collector's house and office, and a mile and a half to the south-east is the camp, formerly a large cantonment, now occupied only by the police and a few of the district officers. The church, built about 1825 at a cost of \u00a38000 (Rs. 80,000) and described by Bishop Heber (1825) as \"large and solid but clumsy,\" though in good repair is seldom used.\n\nKaira has since 1857 been a municipal town with an income in 1878 of \u00a3756 (Rs. 7560). Besides keeping the streets in order, lighting, watering and cleaning them and providing public latrines, the municipality has repaired breaches in the town wall and in part built a bridge at the north entrance to the town. There were in 1878 four Government schools with an average attendance of 333 pupils.\n\nKapadvanj, north lat 23\u00b0 1\u2032; east long. 73\u00b0 7\u2032, the chief town of the sub-division of the same name stands on the east bank of the Mohar river thirty-six miles north-east of Kaira. A fortified town of considerable trade Kapadvanj had in 1872 a population of 13,982 souls, and in 1878 a municipal revenue of \u00a3667 (Rs. 6670).\n\nKapadvanj would seem to be a settlement of great antiquity. The present town contains buildings of from five to eight hundred years old and near the walls is the site of a still more ancient city. According to a local history its original name was Kapatpura or the town of deceit. But as in many other cases this name seems to be little more than an attempt to form a Sanskrit word out of a\n\n---\n\n1 Bom, Gov. Sel. CXIV. 508.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPrakrit name. In modern times Kapadvanj has been the scene of three somewhat important battles. In 1454 in a struggle between Mahmud Khilji king of Malwa and Kutub-ud-din king of Gujar\u00e1t (1451-1459), though in the end victory rested with the Gujar\u00e1t army at one time they were so hard pressed that the king's crown and jewelled girdle remained in the enemy's hands. In 1725 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s under Kantaji and Pilaji Gaikwar were defeated by the Imperial troops commanded by Kh\u00e1nahzad Kh\u00e1n. Eleven years later (1736) the town fell to a joint Mar\u00e1tha and Koli attack. From that time Kapadvanj remained in the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s till, in 1816-1817, in exchange for the neighbouring territory of Bijapur, it was made over to the British. At that time Kapadvanj contained about 10,000 inhabitants; by 1857 the number had risen to 13,000; in 1864 it is returned at 14,202 and in 1872 it had slightly fallen to 13,982 souls lodged in 5025 houses.\n\nOn one of the main routes between Central India and the coast, Kapadvanj has always been a place of considerable trade. In 1816 it was a thriving well built town and in 1864 was famous for trade with enterprising bankers and dealers, in wealth and respectability second only to those of Nadiad. Its merchants are Musalm\u00e1n Bohor\u00e1s of the Shia sect, 'the most enlightened and persevering people in the Kaira district, living in substantial houses models of cleanliness and order.' The business of collecting agate and moss pebbles found in the bed of the M\u00e1jam river, about fifteen miles of Kapadvanj, is almost entirely in the hands of merchants of this class. Its manufactures are soap, glass, and leather butter-jars. Iron ore used to be smelted in Kapadvanj and heaps of iron slag may still be seen in the outskirts of the town. The chief articles of trade are grain and opium from Central India, and tobacco from Gujar\u00e1t. Besides supplying a considerable local demand Kapadvanj goods are exported to the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, the B\u00e1las\u00ednor country and Central India.\n\nThe chief objects of interest in the town are a fine reservoir and an arch in the Ch\u00e1lukya (1000-1300) style. Of the reservoir, according to local story the work of Siddhr\u00e1j Jaisingh king of Anhilv\u00e1da (1094-1143), the following legend remains. The bard of Siddhr\u00e1j, an old Rajput called Bhima, sick of many diseases came to Kapadvanj to bathe and worship in the Madumati or Vatrak stream. Wandering near the river his foot slipped on the steep bank of a pool and he fell. Though sunk in deep water he struggled safely to shore, and on reaching the bank found that his youth and strength were restored. On his return to his master so greatly was he changed that at first he was not known. When his story was told, the king struck with the strangeness of his cure sent messengers to Kapadvanj to find out the wonder-working pool. But at Kapadvanj no one had heard of such a pool and their inquiry was in vain, till one Someshvarbhat a N\u00e1g\u00e1r Br\u00e1hman 'a two-eyed Shiva in saintliness and knowledge' showed the messengers the\n\n---\n\n1 Dr. B\u00fchler. Other derivations are Kabir p\u00e1nch the five tombs, and K\u00e1pad vanj the cloth town.\nobject of their search and explained the source of its virtue. The king ordered the sides of the pool to be clothed with masonry and a temple to be built in honour of Vishnu. To the south of this pool is an underground temple dedicated to Mah\u00e1dev. This, a building of some interest, has never been properly explored. Of Musalm\u00e1n remains there are, besides the town fortifications, the ruins of many fine mosques and tombs. Of modern buildings that of most note is a Jain place of worship. This temple built about twenty-five years ago at a cost of \u00a315,000 (Rs. 1,50,000) is raised on a ten feet high stone plinth. The interior is richly ornamented with marble pillars, and a marble pavement inlaid with much delicacy and taste. At one corner is a plain underground chamber with a black stone image. The Bohora\u2019s quarter has some fine buildings among them a mosque of much beauty and many old dwellings very lofty and rich in wood carving. Near the east gate is a fine rest-house built at a cost of over \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000) by the widow of a rich merchant. Besides the ordinary sub-divisional revenue and police offices Kapadvanj is provided with a sub-judge\u2019s court, a post office and a dispensary. There were in 1878 three Government schools with an average attendance of 366 pupils.\n\nMahudha, north latitude 22\u00b0 49\u2032; east long. 72\u00b0 59\u2032, a town in the Nadi\u00e1d sub-division is one of the head-quarters of the Khed\u00e1v\u00e1l Br\u00e1hmans. Mahudha is said to have been founded by a Hindu prince named Mandhat about two thousand years ago. It had in 1872 a population of 9384 souls lodged in 3319 houses. It is provided with a post office and a dispensary. There were in 1878 five Government schools with an average attendance of 435 pupils.\n\nM\u00e1tar, north latitude 22\u00b0 42\u2032; east longitude 72\u00b0 42\u2032, four miles south-west of Kaira, the chief place in the sub-division of the same name had in 1872 a population of 4804 souls lodged in 1778 houses. Besides the ordinary sub-division revenue and police offices M\u00e1tar is provided with a post office. The chief object of interest in M\u00e1tar is a Shr\u00e1vak temple whose foundations were laid in 1797 by Laxmichand Dharanchand a rich Ahmedabad merchant. Afterwards subscriptions were collected and the building was completed at a cost of about \u00a340,000 (Rs. 4,00,000). On the April, Cha\u00edtra, full moon and on the second and fifteenth of October, K\u00e1rtik, large numbers of worshippers attend.\n\nMehmadabad, north latitude 22\u00b0 49\u2032; east longitude 72\u00b0 48\u2032, a station on the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway eighteen miles south of Ahmedabad, had in 1878 a municipal revenue of \u00a3344 (Rs. 3440). Mehmadabad takes its name from Mahmud Begada who ruled in Gujar\u00e1t from 1459 to 1513 and founded the city about the year 1479, fortifying it and building noble palaces.\u00b9 The city was further improved during the reign of Mahmud III. (1536-1554) who built a deer park, an enclosure six miles\u00b2 long and nearly as broad as a horse could run. At each corner of the park was a palace with gilded walls and roof.

During the reign of this prince and of his predecessor Muzafr II. (1513-1526) Mehmadabad was every year, on the birth-day of the Prophet, the scene of a great festival when all the learned men of the kingdom rehearsed the traditions before the court.\\(^1\\) These buildings remained in repair till the close of the sixteenth century; the author of the Ain-i-Akbari (1590) referring to its many grand buildings surrounded with a wall ten miles square, its pleasure houses and its game enclosure.\\(^2\\) In 1638 it was a small town pleasant and fair with a handsome castle to the west. Its people were Hindus, great spinners and traders in thread.\\(^3\\) In 1666 it was of middling size spinning cotton thread for the most part of Gujar\u00e1t and the neighbouring country.\\(^4\\) By the end of the seventeenth century it had come to such decay that it was no more than a poor village.\\(^5\\) Its population 4939 souls, in 1827, had in 1872 risen to 8065 souls lodged in 2974 houses. The town was prosperous, the houses on the whole well built and the people well-to-do with a considerable manufacture of coarse cotton cloth. Besides the gateways at the principal entrances and the remains of the line of city walls, a step well in the centre of the town said to be older than the time of Mahmud Begada, the Dhundia reservoir, and the Bhamaria\\(^6\\) well on the way to Kaira are all objects of interest. The most beautiful remains are two tombs about one and a half miles east of the town, built in 1484 in honour of Mub\u00e1r\u00e1k Syed one of Mahmud Begada\u2019s ministers. Exclusive of the porch the larger of these tombs is only ninety-four feet square and sixty feet high with fifty-two pillars and a marble floor. Though small there is a simplicity of plan, and a solidity and balance of parts rarely if ever surpassed in any Indian tomb. The details are graceful and suitable. Double verandahs and a screen of pierced stone-work of the very finest tracery give the seclusion and repose indispensable to a mausoleum. Had it been built on a larger scale this tomb would rank among the first of its class.\\(^7\\) There are three inscriptions, religious and moral precepts with no reference to the founder or the date of building. In the tomb are two shrines, one of the prime minister the other of Syed Mir\u00e1n his son. To the south of the tomb are three smaller shrines, one of the architect who built the tomb and the others of Saif-ud-din and Niz\u00e1m-ud-din brothers of Mir\u00e1n Syed\u2019s mother. Besides the ordinary sub-division revenue and police offices the town contains a post office and a dispensary.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bird\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 269.\n\\(^2\\) Gladwin\u2019s Ain-i-Akbari, II. 64.\n\\(^3\\) Mandelslo, 73,74.\n\\(^4\\) Thevenot Voyages, V. 97.\n\\(^5\\) Baldeus in Churchill, III. 514.\n\\(^6\\) This well, now in ruins, is said to have been built by Mahmud Begada as a hot weather retreat.

It had nine strong gates and a dry ditch round the walls. The people about twelve thousand families, were chiefly occupied in weaving fine cloth and other cotton manufactures. They also cut and polished Kapadvanj stones. In revenge for its siding with Fatehsing G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, Raghubhunathr\u00e1v in that year (1775) levied from the town a fine of \u00a36000 (Rs. 60,000).\u2075 In 1803 it was handed over by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r to the British Government. In 1825 it was one of the largest towns in Gujar\u00e1t, with fifteen thousand inhabitants.\u2076 In 1838 it carried on a considerable trade with M\u00e1lwa and the interior importing grain, drugs, gums and dye stuffs, and exporting cotton, coarse cloth, calicoes, tobacco, and coarse sugar.\u2077 In 1847 it was a most thriving little town.\u2078\n\nExcept gateways at the chief entrances no signs of its town walls remain. Its nine entrances are Dalh\u00e1n\u00ed Bh\u00e1gal; Pinjani Bh\u00e1gal; Dumr\u00e1n\u00ed Bh\u00e1gal; Koliv\u00e1d Bh\u00e1gal; Chakl\u00e1si Bh\u00e1gal; Salun Bh\u00e1gal; Marida Bh\u00e1gal; Bilodra Bh\u00e1gal; and Ahmedabadi Bh\u00e1gal.

Most of the leading merchants are local capitalists. Goods sold to distant merchants, as tobacco to M\u00e1lwa traders, are usually paid for in bills of exchange, the brokers or agents who act on behalf of the distant trader taking the risk. Bills are freely cashed up to \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) and sometimes up to \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000). The ordinary currency is the B\u00e1bash\u00e1hi or Baroda rupee. The busy season lasts for about six months from the middle of November to the middle of May. For sugar, butter, and other articles of food the marriage months, January to May, are the busy time; and for cotton and tobacco the harvest months March to May. The chief exports are cotton, tobacco, cummin seed and mah\u00fada grown in Nadi\u00e1d and the country round, and mustard, methi, rape, sarsau, and other oil-seeds chiefly from Kapadvanj and Mod\u00e1sa drawn to Nadi\u00e1d as the local trade-centre. Cotton and tobacco grown by rich cultivators pass from the producer direct to the exporter, while cummin and other seeds raised in poorer districts go through the hands of the village trader before the exporter buys them. Tobacco, Nadi\u00e1d's chief export, goes not only to Central India but through Bombay to the Persian Gulf, Aden, and Zanzibar. Cotton, almost entirely of the three year short-staple, roj\u00ed, sort goes to Bombay, and cummin seed to Bombay, and to Ahmedabad and other parts of Gujar\u00e1t. The manufactured articles exported from the town are yarn, snuff, and dyed cloth. The steam spinning and weaving factory opened in 1876 had, chiefly from a want of capital, to be closed in 1878. Snuff is prepared and exported by V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s. The chief imports are sugar, molasses, spices, cotton seeds, and piece goods. Piece goods from Bombay, Surat, Broach, and Ahmedabad generally pass to the consumer direct from the importer. The imports that have increased most during the last twenty-five years are piece goods, sugar, and sugarcandy. The consumption of Manchester goods was formerly confined to the rich classes of townspeople. But the railway has placed these goods within easy reach of all and their use has spread not only to all townspeople but even to well-to-do villagers. The finer sorts of Manchester piece goods are used by Br\u00e1hmans, V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, and other Hindus and upper class Musalm\u00e1ns. The coarse sorts of English piece goods, and the coarse cloth woven in local hand-looms have to a great extent been superseded by the produce of Ahmedabad and Bombay mills. Though\nat lower prices, there still continues a fair sale for the finer produce of hand-looms. The consumption of molasses, sugar, and sugarcandy formerly confined to towns has of late spread to the rural parts of the district, and the imports of these articles for which Nadi\u00e1d is the local centre show a considerable increase.\n\nExcept the bankers' union, mah\u00e1j\u00e1n samast, which in the matter of trade customs has considerable influence over the whole people there is no regular trade association.\n\nThe chief temples are the Sant\u00e1ram temple with large grounds where, at every full moon, a fair is held; the temples of Nar\u00e1yandev, Gos\u00e1jji or Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, Sv\u00e1min\u00e1r\u00e1yan, Bhairav, K\u00e1lka M\u00e1ta, and Jain temples. The water-supply, from many fresh water springs and pools, is fair. The chief ponds are Undev\u00e1l and Ratna. Besides several rest-houses there are two sadavarts or charity places where poor strangers visiting Nadi\u00e1d are supplied with baked gram or flour and uncooked grain.\n\nNadi\u00e1d, a municipal town had, in 1878, a revenue of \u00a31608 (Rs. 16,080). Besides the ordinary sub-division revenue and police offices the town is provided with a subordinate judge's court, a post office, and a dispensary. Including the High School there were in 1877-78 eight Government schools with an average attendance of 1039 pupils.\n\nNa'pa'd with a population of 5617 souls lies fourteen miles west of the V\u00e1sad railway station in the A'nand sub-division. Till 1869 N\u00e1p\u00e1d was a M\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's station. North of the village is a handsome pond said to have been built about 400 years ago by a Path\u00e1n named Tazekh\u00e1n Narp\u00e1li, governor of Petl\u00e1d. The sides are of brick octagonal in shape about 500 yards round with in each side a triangular flight of steps leading to the water. On the west is an Idga, or place of Id prayers, with a flight of granite steps leading to the lake. Beyond the Idga along the bank are traces of terraces and other buildings. At the end some steps lower than the bank a twenty-four arch causeway, eighty-six yards long and one and a half broad with brick side walls, stretches to a solid piece of masonry about twenty feet square in the centre of the lake. In the middle of this, on four stone pillars, is a small dome with the remains of a few broken marble figures. In the wall on the north-east corner of the lake are three round openings, and from behind them to catch the rain water two walled trenches stretch for 100 or 150 yards in opposite directions with at the meeting point the remains of handsome stone trellis work. The well, vav, to the east of the village, also the work of Tazekh\u00e1n Narp\u00e1li was, in 1838, repaired by a Baroda merchant.\u00b9\n\nOd, north latitude 22\u00b0 37'; east longitude 73\u00b0 10', a town in the A'nand sub-division had, in 1872, a population of 8423 souls lodged in 2256 houses.\n\nTha'sra, north latitude 22\u00b0 48'; east longitude 73\u00b0 15', the chief\n\n\u00b9 Bom.

The reservoir with a temple, rest-house and well were estimated to cost \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000).\u00b2\n\n**Umreth.**\n\nUmreth, north latitude 22\u00b0 41\u2032; east longitude 73\u00b0 9\u2032, a station on the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway had in 1826 a population of 11,823 souls lodged in 3080 houses. In 1872 the number had risen to 13,954, many of them Kh\u00e9dav\u00e1l Br\u00e1hmans, lodged in 4997 houses. One of the largest and richest towns in the Kaira district, Umreth is provided with a sub-judge's court and a post office. There were in 1878 five schools with an average attendance of 538 pupils.\n\n**Vadta'l\u00b3 (Wartal),** about one and a half miles west of the Bori\u00e1vi station on the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway had in 1872 a population of 2826 souls lodged in 693 houses. The interest of Vadta'l is from its connection with the Gujar\u00e1t Hindu reformer Sahaj\u00e1nand Sv\u00e1mi. This man a Lucknow Br\u00e1hman, born about the year 1780, came to Gujar\u00e1t in the beginning of the present century. By his character for holiness, and by the display of supernatural powers, he collected a large body of followers. An ascetic in life and a fierce denouncer of immorality especially among the priesthood, Sahaj\u00e1nand made many enemies and for a time was subjected to persecution. But his sufferings, kindling enthusiasm among his followers, added to his power. About 1810 he settled at Vadta'l and from that time till his death in 1829 his influence steadily spread. Accepting the ordinary Hindu theology and upholding the worship of Krishna, Sahaj\u00e1nand contented himself with trying to mend men's ways by preaching morality and holy living. Among the disorderly classes of K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r he denounced riot and robbery, and among the rich traders of Ahmedabad and Kaira luxury and debauchery. For his followers he laid down rules for a life of almost\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XI., 79.\n\u00b2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XI. 79.\n\u00b3 The name is spelt Wartal in the map.\nascetic rigour and self-denial. Dying childless Sahaj\u00e1nand was in 1829 succeeded in the post of A'ch\u00e1rya or spiritual leader by his nephew, who in turn was, in 1862, succeeded by his nephew the present spiritual head.\n\nSeen from the village of Vadtl the monastery forms a long row of buildings opening about the middle in a massive doorway approached by a flight of granite steps. This doorway leads into a quadrangle with a large temple in the centre. This temple, with little of interest either in form or ornament, has for its chief object of worship an image of Ranchodji or Krishna. Built in 1824 at a cost of about \u00a37500 (Rs. 75,000), it is approached by a flight of stone steps and surrounded by a stone corridor. It is entered by three gates to the north, east, and south. Supported by fifty-six pillars the roof rises in three small and one large central dome the interiors covered with gay but tasteless paintings from scenes in Krishna's life. Round the walls are shrines dedicated to Krishna under different forms. Among these is one sacred to Sahaj\u00e1nand the founder of the sect. This recess is furnished with a silvered bedstead, sukhsupa, and pillows with a richly crested turban laid on them, and by the bed a small stool with a pair of wooden pattens and a table with a metal water jug. In a niche in one of the walls is a picture of the saint and the rest of the wall is adorned with copies of his foot marks. Of the buildings that enclose the quadrangle those on the south side, plain two-storied houses, are resting places for pilgrims. At the south-west corner is Sahaj\u00e1nand's house where in an upper room are kept and shown to pilgrims his bed, his drinking vessels and his clothes. Near this are the buildings allotted to Brahmach\u00e1ris, the Br\u00e1hman inmates of the monastery. The west side of the quadrangle is filled by a large three-storied building opening on the quadrangle, the groundfloor a hall where daily the members of the establishment meet for religious teaching. The two upper stories are resting places for pilgrims at the time of the great half-yearly festivals. The whole of the north side is taken up with buildings belonging to the palace of the A'ch\u00e1rya or spiritual head. In one of these is a spacious hall or reception room. Behind the palace are the quarters set apart for devotees, s\u00e1dhus, who are not Br\u00e1hmans. The buildings on the east are chiefly out-houses, stables, granaries and places for grinding grain. North-west of the centre quadrangle is a large garden and reservoir and to the east beyond the main entrance some blocks of pilgrims' rest-houses.\n\nThe nominal head and manager of the Vadtl monastery is the A'ch\u00e1rya. But as great part of his time is spent in visiting the eleven branch churches the practical management is in the hands of a steward, koth\u00e1ri. Besides providing for pilgrims and arranging matters on the great half-yearly gatherings, this steward has to feed and control from 500 to 1000 persons. The inmates belong to three classes, Brahmach\u00e1ris, devotees of the Br\u00e1hman caste; S\u00e1dhus devotees of the V\u00e1nia and Rajput castes; and P\u00e1l\u00e1s, devotees of the cultivating, artisan, and labouring classes. No members of the Dhed, Cham\u00e1r, and other degraded classes, and no woman of any caste are admitted. For most of the inmates the ordinary daily routine is the\nsame. Rising at dawn they dress and, except those who cook or perform other necessary duties, prepare themselves for early service. This service held at six in the large western hall is conducted by the \u0100ch\u0101rya or some other teacher. It generally lasts from six till eight. From eight to twelve the inmates are at work, study in the case of some and with others labour for the common good. At noon all dine, the Br\u0101hma devotees sitting by themselves. The food of all is millet, wheat, and rice mixed in one dish. In the amount there is no stint, but except on special occasions, condiments such as sugar, molasses, and butter do not form part of the daily meal. After dinner there is another short lecture and then rest for an hour and a half. At three all come together and remain till sunset listening to religious teaching. The next hour is devoted to the worship of the gods in the temple. After worship the great hall again fills and religious teaching goes on till eight or half-past eight. The sick and weakly then leave for supper, the rest remaining till eleven when, except a few of the more zealous who continue to pray or study, all go to bed. The devotees do not at any one time stay long at Vadt\u00e1l. The Brahmach\u0101ris or Br\u0101hma devotees are sent to officiate in some of the subordinate Sv\u0101mi N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47 temples; the S\u0101dhus or V\u0101n\u012ba and Rajput devotees move about the country collecting offerings of money and grain to be taken back to Vadt\u00e1l. And the P\u0101las or low caste devotees accompany their leader in his tours and visits to branch churches.\n\nDuring the year two great religious gatherings are held one on Chaitra Sud 15th (April) and the other on K\u0101rtik Sud 15th (November). The first in honour of the birth of Sahaj\u0101nand lasts for eight, and the second in honour of his father for six days. On both of these occasions about 20,000 pilgrims chiefly from Gujar\u0101t and K\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101r attend. Minor fairs with from one thousand to three thousand visitors, are held in August, September and October.\nPANCH MAH\u00c1LS.\nPANCH MAHA'LS.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nDESCRIPTION.\n\nThe Panch Mah\u00e1ls, or five sub-divisions, lying between 22\u00b0 30' and 23\u00b0 10' north latitude, and 73\u00b0 35' and 74\u00b0 10' east longitude, have a total area of 1595 square miles and a population of 240,743 souls or 151 to the square mile. Of \u00a326,859 (Rs. 2,68,590) the total realizable land revenue, \u00a326,841 (Rs. 2,68,410) were recovered before the close of the year ending 31st July 1877.\n\nThe five sub-divisions of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, lying in the extreme east of Gujar\u00e1t, form two groups separated by a hilly and forest-clad strip of the B\u00e1riya state, varying in breadth from about nine miles in the north to thirty in the south. The western group, the larger of the two, comprises the sub-divisions of Godhra in the north and K\u00e1lol, including the petty division of H\u00e1lol, in the south. Except the Kaira district beyond the Mahi to the north-west, this group is surrounded by native territory; Baroda lies to the south and west, B\u00e1riya to the east, and Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth to the north. The eastern group is composed of the Dohad sub-division with, in the north, the petty division of Jh\u00e1lod. B\u00e1riya lies on the south-west and west, Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth on the north-west, the Meyw\u00e1r state of Kushalgad on the north and north-east, and the M\u00e1lwa state of J\u00e1bua on the east and south-east.\n\nThe district is for administrative purposes distributed over three sub-divisions including two petty divisions. These as shewn in the following summary have on an average an area of 531 square miles, 239 villages, and 80,248 inhabitants.\n\n| Name | Area | Villages | Government | Alienated | Total |\n|------|------|----------|------------|-----------|-------|\n|      |      | Inhabited | Uninhabited | Inhabited | Uninhabited | Government | Alienated | Total |\n| Godhra | 588 | 187 | 4 | 174 | 4 | 33 | 1 | 28 | 191 | 33 | 224 | 74,014 | 127 | 6263 |\n| K\u00e1lol | 408 | 206 | 4 | 145 | 25 | 2 | 22 | 246 | 27 | 273 | 65,431 | 163 | 9526 |\n| Dohad | 608 | 198 | 1 | 218 | 15 | 21 | ... | 30 | 199 | 21 | 220 | 100,298 | 165 | 11,050 |\n| Total | 1595 | 587 | 51 | 540 | 21 | 78 | 3 | 84 | 638 | 81 | 719 | 240,743 | 151 | 26,859 |\n\nOf the 638 Government villages, 169 are in the hands of large landholders, talukd\u00e1rs, and forty-six are farmed.\nThe western division is a plain, rising gradually to the east, little cut into by rivers, and except by some small hills in the north, and in the south where at Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner the great P\u00e1v\u00e1gad peak rises 2700 feet high, broken only by occasional granite-topped mounds. It forms three belts, a northern, a middle, and a southern. In the north, about twenty miles broad, lies Godhra, in parts rich and well tilled but on the whole wild and rudely cultivated, much of it covered with brushwood and forest, and in the north and east broken by bare patches of granite rock, or rising into peaks of curiously piled granite boulders. South of Godhra the lands of K\u00e1lol form a central belt about ten miles broad, highly tilled, with rich brick-built villages, their lands laid out in hedged fields studded with mango and mahuda groves, and marked by rows of palmyra palms whose heads rise quaintly from a growth of banian and pipal that clings to and hides their stems. South of K\u00e1lol the country grows gradually wilder till, after about eight miles, near H\u00e1lool the plain breaks into the spurs and ridges that centre in the massive hill of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad. So far the villages are rich and well built, surrounded by carefully kept fields. But near the spurs of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad and southeast about fifteen miles more to the borders of J\u00e1mbughoda, except in the western villages and in a few hamlets and forest clearings, the country is untilled and unpeopled, covered by a low growth of forest timber.\n\nAcross the rough wooded belt of B\u00e1riya land and higher by seven or eight hundred feet than the Godhra plain, Jh\u00e1lod in the north and Dohad in the south form a compact block about forty miles from north to south and twenty from east to west. The surface of the country is waving, broken by many water courses, and by a succession of low abrupt and rugged stony ridges, separated by rich moist valleys broad in the north and narrower to the south. Except on the sides of some of the higher hills, the uplands and valleys are opener and less wooded than in the western division. Though somewhat bare and much of it waste, the country, well supplied with water both in streams and pools, is not wanting in beauty. In the cold season, on a back ground of soft well wooded hills, rich deep-green stretches of gram and wheat, unbroken by hedgerows, are studded with mounds and knolls, some clad with bamboo and brushwood, others bare and capped with masses of glistening snow-white quartz. Here and there are compact well built villages. But more striking are, on rising ground, each near its own plot of land, the scattered dwellings of Bhils enclosed by creeper-covered bamboo trellis-work. Later in the season the gold of the ripening wheat fields is, along the edges of streams, fringed by belts of bright white or white and red poppies, and in the hot months, though baked and bare, the land is in many places relieved by the brilliant scarlet masses of the kh\u00e1khr\u00e1 or Butea frondosa. During the rainy season the whole country is fresh and green.\n\nIn Dohad are several low steep ridges and in Godhra some granite-topped mounds and rocks. But the only hill is P\u00e1v\u00e1gad, the chief natural feature, and one of the places of greatest interest, in eastern Gujar\u00e1t.\nP\u00e1v\u00e1gad about twenty-five miles south of Godhra and by road twenty-nine miles east of Baroda can, over a long distance, be clearly seen from the Bombay and Baroda railway. Nearer at hand with its far stretching spurs the hill, about twenty-six miles round, rises with massive but clear cut outline about 2500 feet above the plain. Its base and lower slopes are thick covered with rather stunted timber. But its shoulders and centre crest are on the south, west, and north, cliffs of bare trap, too steep for trees. Less inaccessible the eastern heights are wooded and topped by massive masonry walls and bastions rising with narrowing fronts to the scarped rock that crowns the hill. According to the local story, in a bygone age a valley ran where P\u00e1v\u00e1gad now stands. On the high ground overlooking the valley lived an ascetic Vishv\u00e1mitra Rishi. He owned a cow, the famous K\u00e1mdh\u00faa, gifted with speech and an unfailing store of milk. Grazing on the brink of the hollow she one day slipped and unable to climb the steep sides filled the valley with milk and so swam home. Learning what had happened the holy man, to prevent another mischance, prayed that the valley might be filled. His prayer was granted, the gods sending so large a hill that three quarters of it filled the hollow. The rest standing out of the plain was called the quarter-hill, P\u00e1v\u00e1gad.\n\nThe first historic reference to P\u00e1v\u00e1gad is from the bard Chand, who, in the account of Bhim Dev I. of Anhilv\u00e1da (1022-1072), speaks of R\u00e1m Gaur the Tu\u00e1r as P\u00e1v\u00e1's lord. The earliest authentic account is, about 1300, its acquisition by Choh\u00e1n Rajputs, fugitives from Ranth\u00e1mbhor (1299-1300) in Mew\u00e1r before the army of Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji. The Choh\u00e1n chiefs, of whom the names only have been preserved, continued to hold the hill till it was taken from them by Sult\u00e1n Mahmud Begada in 1484. Before Mahmud's victory the Musalm\u00e1n kings of Ahmedabad had more than once tried and failed to take the fort. Of the first of these attempts, in 1418 (821 H.) during the reign of Sult\u00e1n Ahmed I., no details except the fact of its failure remain. About thirty years later 1450-1452 (853-855 H.) Sult\u00e1n Ahmad's son Muhammad Sh\u00e1h so closely invested the fortress that the garrison was only saved by a diversion made in their favour by Mahmud Khilji of M\u00e1lwa. After about thirty years (1483, 17th March?) Mahmud Begada laid siege to the fort.

In the early dawn, when according to their custom the garrison left the walls to bathe, Kiv\u00e1m-ul-mulk with a party of picked men scaled the fort, driving the Rajputs within the inner wall. Later in the same day Malik Ay\u00e1z Sult\u00e1n\u00ed, another of Mahmud\u2019s captains, passing through a breach in the western wall gained a position that commanded the great gate. An attempt to dislodge Malik Ay\u00e1z failed and the besieged in despair, burning their wives and children, divided into two parties, one retiring to the upper fort and the other under command of the chief and his minister remaining below. At dawn the Musalm\u00e1ns forced open the great gate and cut down the defenders, their leaders falling wounded into the Sult\u00e1n\u2019s hands (17th Nov. 1484). The garrison of the upper fortress soon after surrendered.\u00b9 The bard\u2019s stories of Musalm\u00e1n attempts on Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner tell how Shri Jaysingh Dev the P\u00e1t\u00e1i Raval,\u00b2 once at the time of the nine night, navr\u00e1t, festival went to see the women of his capital dance and sing. Among the women was one of great beauty, and the chief, overcome by the sight of her, caught hold of her robe. But she, for it was the goddess K\u00e1li, turning in anger cursed him telling him that his kingdom would soon pass away. Not long after J\u00e1va Lovo, the son of a Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner Br\u00e1hman, saw Mahmud the Ahmedabad Sult\u00e1n ride past P\u00e1v\u00e1gad and, as he rode, look to the hill and clutch his moustache. Hastening to his chief J\u00e1va warned him that the Sult\u00e1n would soon come against P\u00e1v\u00e1gad. Sending the lad to Ahmedabad to watch the Sult\u00e1n, Jaysingh made ready to defend his fort strengthening it by five barriers, water, wood, stone, mud, and forest. At Ahmedabad J\u00e1va kept watch. One day he saw the Sult\u00e1n at his window look across to P\u00e1v\u00e1gad and clutch his moustache. Hastening to P\u00e1v\u00e1gad he told the chief that the Sult\u00e1n was coming. All was made ready and though backed by 500,000 men and resolute enough to keep up the blockade for twelve years Mahmud was at last forced to make peace without taking the fort. Asking how the R\u00e1val was so ready to meet him he was told J\u00e1va\u2019s story and raised him to be his minister. This tale may perhaps refer to the attempt and failure of the first Mu\u1e25ammad (1450). Another of the songs tells how in 1485 (1541 S.) the P\u00e1t\u00e1i R\u00e1val gave up his life when Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h the Great took P\u00e1v\u00e1gad.\n\nOn gaining possession of the hill Mahmud added to the defences both of the upper and lower forts, and for the first time fortified the top plateau making it its citadel, Mauliya or Lord of the Hill.\u00b3 So strong was it that according to the saying of Syed Jal\u00e1l, if an old\n\n\u00b9 According to Musalm\u00e1n historians they surrendered in three days. The Hindu chronicles make out that they stood a blockade of twelve years.\u2014R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 287.\n\u00b2 The title P\u00e1t\u00e1i R\u00e1val is probably only a contraction for P\u00e1v\u00e1pati R\u00e1val, the R\u00e1val lord of P\u00e1va.\u2014Ind. Ant. LXIII. 2.\n\u00b3 The use of the name Mauliya is doubtful. In some passages it seems confined to the central peak on whose pinnacle K\u00e1li M\u00e1ta\u2019s temple now stands. In other passages it seems to include the whole of the hill top, also known as the B\u00e1l\u00e1 or high fort.\u2014See Ind. Ant. LXIII. 1-9.\nwoman were but to hurl a stone from the top of the fort all the men in the world could not carry on the siege. In spite of its strength before fifty years were over the hill was again taken. This time (1535) the besiegers were the Moghals under command of the Emperor Hum\u00e1yun (1531-1556). Incited by the hope of gaining Sult\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h\u2019s (1526-1536) treasure stored in the fort, and helped by the desertion of Rumi Kh\u00e1n,\u00b9 one of Bah\u00e1dur\u2019s chief engineers, Hum\u00e1yun pressed the siege, R\u00e1ja Narsingh Dev and Ikhtiy\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n holding out gallantly on their sovereign\u2019s behalf. Surprised by Hum\u00e1yun\u2019s sudden approach the garrison had been forced to spike and leave half way up the hill an immense gun known as the Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1hi.\u00b2 Repairing the gun Rumi Kh\u00e1n directed it against the fortifications, breaking down a gateway with the first and rooting up a great tree close by with the second shot. But among the besieged a European engineer Faring Kh\u00e1n, a Musalm\u00e1n convert, served his gun with such skill that the shot striking the cannon burst it in pieces. His chief siege gun disabled, Hum\u00e1yun\u2019s efforts to storm the hill failed. Some time after a band of Kol\u00eds sent down by the besieged for supplies fell into the hands of the Musalm\u00e1n outposts. To save his life one of them offered to point out a secret path up the hill. The path was tried and by the help of iron bars driven into it, the rock was scaled and the fortress entered.\u00b3 The garrison taken by surprise were routed, some of them throwing themselves over the walls. Others, among them the commander Ikhtiy\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, retired to the citadel or top plateau but on the offer of honourable terms capitulated, August 1535 (7 Safar 942 H.) Very shortly afterwards (1535) on the recovery of his power by Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, T\u00e1rd\u00ed Beg the officer in charge for Hum\u00e1yun in spite of its strength and the abundance of munitions evacuated P\u00e1v\u00e1gad.\u2074 Eight years later 1543 (950 H.) when Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad II. threw off Darya Kh\u00e1n\u2019s control he moved against P\u00e1v\u00e1gad where Darya Kh\u00e1n had left his women and treasure. The young king pressed the siege with vigour and courage, and the garrison making only a half-hearted defence the lower fort was taken. Fatuji the commander retiring to the citadel or top plateau was captured and sent prisoner to Surat. Thirty years later (1573) on the flight of Sh\u00e1h Mirz\u00e1, who had held it for a short time, P\u00e1v\u00e1gad fell into the hands of the Emperor Akbar.\n\n\u00b9 Unrivalled in his time in preparing fireworks. He was probably the Rumi Kh\u00e1n who cast the M\u00e1lki Maid\u00e1n of Bij\u00e1pur.\u2014Bird, 240.\n\u00b2 This gun had been left by the Portuguese after their unsuccessful attempt on Di\u00fa in 1531. It was the largest ever seen in India and required a special machine to take it to Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner.\u2014Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, IV. 123.\n\u00b3 Ferishta gives the following details. Hum\u00e1yun when he was shown the path up the hill made a number of steel spikes and chose a body of 300 men to arrange the surprise. During the night several false attacks were made on other parts of the fort. The spikes were fixed and thirty-nine officers climbed up, Hum\u00e1yun himself mounting fortieth. Before sunrise the whole detachment was within the walls when displaying a preconcerted signal his troops attacked the garrison from outside. On this the 300 forced their way to one of the gates and let in the troops. Great wealth was found the accumulation of years from Asia Minor, Tartary and Europe.\u2014Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, II. 79. From this Hum\u00e1yun gave to his officers and soldiers, proportioning the value to the rank and merit of each, as much gold and silver as could be heaped on their shields.\u2014Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, II. 80.\n\u2074 Akbarn\u00e1ma in Elliot\u2019s His. of India, VI. 17.\nFor about 150 years the fort was held by an Imperial garrison till in 1727 it was surprised by Krishnaji the foster son of Kantaji Kadam Bande. Krishnaji made Pavaagad his head quarters and issuing from it, caused great disorder in Gujar\u00e1t and made raids into Marwar and as far as Jhalor. He seems to have kept the fort till it was taken by Sindia, probably between 1761 and 1770. Strongly garrisoning it Sindia held Pavaagad till in 1803 (17th September) a small British force commanded by Colonel Woodington breached the double wall near a tower at the east corner of the inner fort to the left of the Budhiya Gate and forced the garrison to capitulate. Restored to him in 1804, Pavaagad continued with Sindia till in 1853 (August 1st) it was made over to the British Government.\n\nThe following details show the present state of its fortifications. The chief objects of interest at the base of the hill are on the lower slopes of the north-east spur the ruins of Rajput Champ\u00e1ner, and at the foot of the south cliff caves till lately the dwelling place of Hindu ascetics. About three and a half miles from H\u00e1lol leaving the cart road close to the south-west corner of the walls of Musalm\u00e1n Champ\u00e1ner, the hill-path strikes south across a rough wooded stone-strewn tract. The distance from the cart road to K\u00e1lka M\u00e1t\u00e1\u2019s temple on the highest peak of the hill is about three miles, two of them up the hill side, the third along the flat hill top. The path, creeping up the eastern spur though rough in places, is nowhere too rugged for a palanquin. After rather less than half a mile the first line of fortifications is entered by the Atak gate, once double but now with its outer gate in ruins. This line of fortification, the historic Lower Fort, is a massive stone wall with strong bastions stretching across the less precipitous parts of the eastern spur. The present wall seems to have been built by Sindia. In 1803 it was passed by the English without opposition. Inside the Atak gate are the ruins of the Medi or Himna Palace and the Medi or Himna pond, a deep square pond, its flights of stone steps in ruins but still holding water even in the driest seasons. It was here in 1803 that the English battery was placed. About half a mile further the Mohoti or\n\n---\n\n1 The date has not been traced. In 1780 Pavaagad was in Sindia\u2019s hands (Grant Duff, 432). In 1815 a British force seems to have occupied Champ\u00e1ner and to have sent an advance party to the Medi pond. Some shots were fired; but no extreme measures seem to have been taken.\u2014Captain Nixon\u2019s account of Champ\u00e1ner, 1815.\n\n2 As. An. Reg. 1808, 38. The spelling Budhiya has been given as it is now so written in Gujarati. The Muhammadan historians write it Baria. Of the value of the hill top the opinions of military officers seem to differ. Capt. Dunsterville (1824, 12th October) thought like Colonel Woodington that it commanded the main fort. But Capt. Nixon (1815) thought guns on the hill top would be useless as the scarp was so steep that they could never be pointed low enough.\n\n3 This is Mr. Acworth\u2019s (1878) estimate after judging distances on the spot. Mr. Acworth walked from the bottom of the hill to K\u00e1lka M\u00e1t\u00e1\u2019s temple in fifty-three minutes. Some of the early accounts, Trans. Bom. Lit. Soc. 140-145 and Bom. Gov. Sel., XXIII., 33 give six miles. But Capt. Nixon (1815) says from the window of the house we stayed in at Champ\u00e1ner the sound of a gun fired in the upper fort was heard six seconds after seeing the flash, that is a distance of about 2300 yards. On their first day\u2019s firing several of the shot went over the town.\n\n4 When Capt. Nixon (1815) wrote it was completely in ruins.\u2014Captain Nixon\u2019s account of Champ\u00e1ner, 12th October 1824.\n\n5 The battery was placed close to a pond with brushwood to the left. It was near enough to the fort to effect every object.\u2014Col. Kenny, Kaira, 22nd March 1815.\nGreat Gate gives entrance through the second line of defence. This gateway is a most formidable fortification the path winding in the rock through four gates each commanding the one below it. The lowest of the four is called the Budhiya or Spear-butt Gate and the highest, about 150 feet above, the Bh\u00e1l\u00e1pul or Spear-head Gate. Massive walls connect the gates and from the Bh\u00e1l\u00e1pul Gate sweep up to the line of fortification that stretches across the crest of the spur. Beyond the Mohoti Gate the path, for about 200 yards, lies over level ground with a high ridge on the left, crowned by a strong wall running back from the Mohoti Gate to the third line of defence. This third line of defence is passed through the Sadan Sh\u00e1h Gate, a winding passage cut through the solid rock crowned with towering walls and bastions and crossed by a double Hindu gateway, the lower nearly perfect, the upper in ruins. It was to the left of these strong gates that in 1803 the walls were breached. From the battery on the Medi pond the wall was broken down in two places. The breach in the outer wall in a tower to the left of the Budhiya Gate was nearly complete and that in the inner wall to the left of the Bh\u00e1l\u00e1pul Gate was complete. The breach in the outer wall has been repaired; that in the inner wall is still easily seen.\n\nThe chief remains on the hill lie within the Sadan Sh\u00e1h gateway. From the gate a path leads off the main road 100 yards to the right, to the head of a ravine that ends in a cliff several hundred feet deep. Near the edge surrounded by a strong round stone wall with one narrow opening is a small cruciform cut-stone chamber completely shut in. Through chinks in the wall a grave is seen where according to local story a Rajput princess was buried alive. Beyond this tomb on the edge of the cliff are the remains of a S\u00e1t Mehel or seven-storied Palace. Of the seven stories four were above ground and three cut one below the other in the face of the cliff. The four upper stories are in ruins. But down the face of the cliff, commanding a wide view across a deep valley, runs a covered stone staircase and inside of the staircase, one below the other, three chambers each about twenty feet square, with three pillars on each side, the roof domed, and the cornice slightly ornamented. The lowest chamber hangs over the cliff at a point where two scarps meet at right angles. Beyond the deep valley to the west of the S\u00e1t Mehel, a spur stretches north falling to the plain in steep terraces just above Shakar Kh\u00e1n\u2019s lake. Across this ridge runs an old wall and other remains of fortifications known as the Julian Budan gates. Above them on an outstanding point of the same spur are two more buildings, the N\u00e1g\u00e1r Haveli or N\u00e1g\u00e1r Br\u00e1hman\u2019s Palace. It was along\n\n---\n\n1 This is the same Sadan Sh\u00e1h whose shrine is on the spire of K\u00e1lka M\u00e1t\u00e1\u2019s temple.\n2 As. An. Reg. 1803, 38; Col. Kenny, Kaira, 22nd March 1815.\n3 Mr. Acworth, 21st March 1879.\n4 This building is also called the Ch\u00e1mpa R\u00e1n\u00edna and the Kavera Jahverina meh\u00e9l. It is said to have been the palace of a favourite queen. Major Watson thinks it was meant for the ladies of the zenana to see hunts from.\u2014Ind. Ant. LXIII. Mr. Acworth adds; it is said to have been built by two brothers-in-law of one of the P\u00e1t\u00e1i R\u00e1vals, robbers who had an underground passage from the Sadan Sh\u00e1h gate to the Khund river at Med\u00e1pur in H\u00e1lo\u0142. Both near the Sadan Sh\u00e1h gate and at Med\u00e1pur the openings of a passage may still be seen,\nthis spur that in 1803, when the walls were breached, the bulk of the garrison escaped.\\(^1\\)\n\nReturning to the main track, about 100 yards above the Sadansha gate is, on the left, the M\u00e1chi Haveli or Terrace Palace, a wooden building where Sindia's commandant used to live, and where a small police party is now posted. Close by, on the right, are the ruins of a fine stone building the old M\u00e1chi Haveli. Further on is a pond with at one end the ruins of a brick mosque and near it the Panch Kuva or Five wells, four of them ruined the fifth in good order yielding excellent water. About a quarter of a mile above the M\u00e1chi Haveli is the Mak\u00e1i Koth\u00e1rka Darv\u00e1ja, or the Maize Store Gate, with strong defences on either side overlooking the approach. Inside of the gate on the left are three large domes the Mak\u00e1i Koth\u00e1rs or maize granaries and on the level top of the south-east spur, scarped by rocks at least 1000 feet high and joined to the hill only by a narrow neck, are a ruined gateway, old buildings, and a line of wall enclosing several covered reservoirs. These are the ruins of the palace of Jaysingh Dev the last of the P\u00e1t\u00e1i\\(^2\\) R\u00e1vals (1484). At the end of the spur is a small shrine of Bhadra or the propitious K\u00e1li.\n\nThis plateau and the hill side as far down as the Budhiya Gate, 'a pleasant place with springs, ponds and green trees' formed the upper fort taken by Mahmud Begada in 1484.\\(^3\\) The top plateau, some 1500 feet higher, was at that time unfortified or protected only by a single gate. Except that gate the defences were originally built by Mahmud Begada's engineers who, fortifying its approaches with the greatest skill, made the upper plateau their citadel naming it Mauliya or Lord of the hill. For a quarter of a mile above the Mak\u00e1i Koth\u00e1rka Darv\u00e1ja the ascent is very steep, then comes a moat or deep-cut cleft called from the moveable beams laid across it the P\u00e1tid\u00e1pul or Plank Gate. After about a quarter of a mile the foot of the scarp of the upper plateau is reached. Along its foot for nearly 400 yards the path zigzags to the T\u00e1ra or Star Gate. Then steps cut in the rock mount the scarp for about 100 yards and lead to a square building on the edge of the cliff. This building with two gates, the Suraj or Sun Gate in front and the Nag\u00e1r Kh\u00e1na or Drum Gate behind, originally built by Mahmud Begada's engineers, was with all other works above the P\u00e1tia chasm destroyed by the English in 1803 and afterwards built by H. H. Sindia.\\(^4\\) The outer gate contains stones taken from Jain temples and the inner gate is in form a fine Musalm\u00e1n arch. On either side of the Nag\u00e1r Kh\u00e1na entrance the edge of the upper plateau is topped by a fifteen feet wall, and on all other parts its natural defence, a sheer cliff over 200 feet high, needs no artificial help.\n\nWithin the Nag\u00e1r Kh\u00e1na Gate, is the Musalm\u00e1n citadel or Mauliya, an irregular oblong plateau about a mile from north to south and a quarter of a mile from east to west. Much of it is uneven without\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Capt. Kenny, 15th March 1815.\n\\(^2\\) The name P\u00e1t\u00e1i R\u00e1val is probably a contraction from P\u00e1v\u00e1pati R\u00e1val, that is the R\u00e1val who rules at P\u00e1va.\u2014Ind. Ant.

The chief object of interest is at the south rising from a cluster of Banian trees and prickly pear and carinda bushes a rocky peak about 250 feet high. At its foot is a small reservoir and up its side runs a flight of 226 steps said to have been built about a hundred years ago by Mah\u00e1d\u00e1j\u00ed S\u00edn\u00e1. At the top is the temple of K\u00e1lka M\u00e1ta with, in its chief shrine, three images, K\u00e1lka M\u00e1ta in the centre, M\u00e1ha K\u00e1li on her right, and Bechara M\u00e1ta on her left. Except for its rich marble floor, presented about twenty years ago by the minister of Limbd\u00ed in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, the temple probably about 150 years old is small and plain. On its spire is the shrine of Sadan Pir a Musalm\u00e1n saint, still held in respect. K\u00e1lka M\u00e1ta\u2019s chief worshippers are Kol\u00eds and Bhils. But especially on the full moon of Ch\u00e1tra, April, and at Dasara, October, there are large meetings of Hindus of all classes.\n\nComing down K\u00e1lka M\u00e1ta\u2019s peak and turning to the west of the plateau, the path skirting the edge passes along the brink of precipices scarped in many places right down to the plain. On the west side of the hill are seven massive brick and mortar Musalm\u00e1n domes called the Nav L\u00e1kh Koil\u00e1rs or Nine Lac Granaries each of them a room about twenty-one feet square. Along the north over rough uneven ground are remains of ponds and reservoirs, and on the east, when the circle of the plateau is completed, some small but finely carved Jain temples.\n\nThe railway has reduced its value as a sanitarium. But for Europeans stationed in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and Baroda, P\u00e1v\u00e1gad is during the hot season a most refreshing change from the plains. The hill top is well supplied with water from a spring about half way down near the line of the lower fort. During the hot season of 1839 with the temperature at 105\u00b0 in Baroda, in the granaries on the top of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad the thermometer on the warmest day did not rise above 87\u00b0 and on other days was not more than 83\u00b0. In the open air the readings somewhat less carefully taken, shewed an extreme maximum of 97\u00b0 and an average maximum of 94\u00b0. During the whole time a constant breeze blew from the south-west.\n\nBoth the eastern and western divisions drain into the Mah\u00ed. In Godhra and K\u00e1lol the streams flow west falling directly into it. In Jhal\u00f3d and Doh\u00e1d the slope is north-east, the water draining into the An\u00e1s one of the Mah\u00ed\u2019s tributaries. The district is well supplied with water from ponds and streams. The Mah\u00ed the only\n\n---\n\n1 K\u00e1l\u00edk\u00e1\u2019s shrine is mentioned as a place of pilgrimage under the Anhilv\u00e1da kings, R\u00e1s M\u00e1la 189; her worship is referred to in an inscription dated 1469. The present temple would seem to be of later date built probably after the capture of the hill by R\u00e1nt\u00e1j\u00ed Kadam (1727). The author of the Mirat-i-Ahmad\u00ed (1746-1768) mentions the temple of K\u00e1lka Bhav\u00e1ni and the shrine of Sadan Sh\u00e1h on its top. The end of the temple spire seems to have been removed to make room for the shrine probably to conciliate Muhammadian feeling and protect the rest of the temple.\u2014Ind. Ant. LXIII. 7. Mr. Acworth says that the Hindus claim Sadan as a Hindu declaring that to save their temple, the Br\u00e1hmans gave out he was a Musalm\u00e1n.\n\n2 As a sanitarium the only drawback to P\u00e1v\u00e1gad is that in the hot weather the wind blows so fiercely that unless of very great strength nothing but a domed roof can stand. Their domes repaired, their verandahs renewed and outhouses built, the nine lac granaries would at a cost of about \u00a3570 form excellent quarters for two European families.\nlarge river forms, for eighteen miles, the west boundary of the Godra sub-division. During this part of its course the Mahi, within the hot season a stream two feet deep and about fifty yards wide flows between sloping alluvial banks seldom more than twenty feet high. On account of the broken ground along its banks its water is seldom used for irrigation. In Godhra the P\u00e1nam on its way north to the Mahi, passing through the east of the sub-division, is a very considerable stream, at times during the rains most difficult to cross. In K\u00e1lol the Karad passing west to the Mahi between banks from forty to fifty feet high, at all times with a running stream and many deep wide pools, is unfordable during the rains. About two miles from K\u00e1lol it is spanned by a three-arched bridge, each arch seventy-six feet wide. Of minor streams that cease to flow in the hot weather the Kun through the centre of Godhra, the Mesri to the south of Godhra town, and the Goma close by the town of K\u00e1lol rise in the highlands west of the P\u00e1nam valley and after courses of not more than fifty miles fall into the Mahi. The Vishv\u00e1mitri taking its rise from P\u00e1v\u00e1gad passes south by Baroda city to join the Dh\u00e1dhar. The Devnadi from the Bariya hills, also an affluent of the Dh\u00e1dhar, passes twenty miles south through H\u00e1lo. In the east the only river of any size is the An\u00e1s. This rising in M\u00e1lwa runs north over a rocky bed along the east of Dohad and Jh\u00e1lod and falls into the Mahi at the extreme north-east corner of the district. A considerable stream during the rains, in the hot season it ceases to flow, dwindling into a row of pools. Dohad and Jh\u00e1lod are better supplied with streams which hold water throughout the year and are readily available for water-lift irrigation as in many places their banks overhang. Of minor streams, all with rocky beds, are the Damaj on which Dohad stands, the Khan, Kali, Gang\u00e1ri, Kanari, Barod, and the Machan on which Jh\u00e1lod stands.\n\nThe west is well supplied with ponds and reservoirs, five of them in Godhra and one in K\u00e1lol of special size. Of the Godhra reservoirs that at the town of Godhra has an area of seventy acres. On the Dohad road about twelve miles east of Godhra is the Orv\u00e1da lake covering 110 acres and said never to have been dry and to have a pillar in the middle visible only in seasons of extreme drought. The third, 120 acres in area, is at Shera about twelve miles north of Godhra, and the fourth, eighty-seven acres, is at Kaml\u00e1v. At Mal\u00e1v about five miles east of K\u00e1lol, covering 133 acres, is an embanked and masonry built reservoir provided with sluices, and watering a large stretch of rice land. In the east the hills and valleys of Dohad and Jh\u00e1lod are well suited for storing water. They contain many ponds, most of them natural but some of them banked and masonry built. During the hot season the smaller ponds are dry but some of the larger hold water throughout the year. The Chha\u015ba lake, at Dohad, one of the largest, has strong masonry walls, flights of stone steps at two ends, and a masonry outlet for waste water.\n\nExcept in its south-west corner, no detailed inquiry into the geology of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls has been made. In the eastern division though black and clay soils occur, the surface is chiefly somewhat shallow light-red soil much mixed with gravel. The rocks are\ntrap, schist, limestone, millstone, grit and marble in small quantities.\\(^1\\) In the western division near Godhra all the surface rocks are metamorphic, and in other places metamorphic rocks alternate with beds of quartzite sandstone. The geological survey of the south-west of the district shows two chief geological features, the great trap rock of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad and a group of semi-metamorphic beds chiefly quartzite or quartzite sandstone. P\u00e1v\u00e1gad is believed to be the remains of a range of trap that stretched south to the R\u00e1jpipla hills. It is not easy to understand how except by the force of the sea the whole large intervening tract can have been cleared of trap. A very slight change of land and sea level would flood the plain country round P\u00e1v\u00e1gad, and it is possible that at one time the hill was an island. Unlike those to the south-east, the P\u00e1v\u00e1gad traps lie perfectly flat. Their mineral character is in many parts peculiar. Of the numerous terraces below the upper flat of the hill, some are ordinary basaltic lava flows. But many are of a light purple clay rock rare in other places. Somewhat cherty in appearance and generally with small crystals of glassy felspar this rock is sometimes mottled purple and grey. It is almost always distinctly marked by planes of lamination parallel to the stratification sometimes so finely as to be more like an ordinary shale than a volcanic rock. In spite of this these beds seem at times to pass into basaltic trap, and one form of basalt with crystals of glassy felspar has weathered edges much like this purplish shaley rock. The formation of these beds is not easy to explain. They often look like volcanic ash. And, though their highly laminated structure seems due to deposition in water it is in places irregular and the beds containing pumice could hardly occur in under-water formations. They may be flows of very thin volcanic mud or their present character may in part at least be due to changes after consolidation. Similar beds are very rare among traps and no other instance of their development on so large a scale has been observed in Western India.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe other chief feature of the geology of the south-west corner of the district, the group of quartzite sandstone beds, has been traced for about twenty miles east of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad and for seven or eight miles south of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. The other beds are mostly slates, conglomerates and limestones, ferruginous bands occasionally occurring. Some of the limestones are highly crystalline; in one place near Kadv\u00e1l they were found to contain actinolite; in other places, as near Surajpur they were quite unaltered. All the rocks susceptible of cleavage are highly cleaved, the planes in general striking about west \\(10^\\circ - 20^\\circ\\) north. Some of the slate appears so fissile that it might probably be used for roofing. The conglomerates are perhaps the most distinctive beds in the group. They are well seen about Jhab\u00e1n on the road between Surajpur and J\u00e1mbughoda. The matrix is in general a coarse gritty sandstone containing pebbles and boulders often one and sometimes three feet in diameter of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is believed to be mainly composed of metamorphic rocks with a few trap outliers.\u2014Mem. Geo. Sur. VI. 3, 30.\n\n\\(^2\\) Mr. Blandford. Mem. Geo. Sur. VI. 3, 181-182.\ngranite, quartzite, talcose slate, and crystalline limestone. The talcose slate, of which some of the pebbles are composed, is scarcely more metamorphosed than the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner beds themselves. The quartzite boulders are the largest. The limestone pebbles are very numerous and as they are dissolved on the surface by exposure to the weather, the hollows which contained them remain empty, and give a peculiar vesicular appearance to the rock. Some of the limestones of the pebbles contain silicious laminae. Cleavage is frequently apparent in these pebbles, though it is but rarely distinguishable in the sandy matrix. At one place near A'ndapur the matrix of the conglomerate appeared to be a perfect breccia, a mixture of angular fragments of black slaty silicious rock and coarse sandstone, both containing pebbles. This was near the junction of conglomerate with slaty beds, the latter apparently the newer. The rocks appear to have been much crushed. They look as if angular fragments of slate had become mixed with sandstone, and then all reconsolidated. But the granite and quartzite pebbles show no signs of violence. Very little can be ascertained of the sequence of the beds. The slate, limestones, and quartzites of Surajpur are evidently high in the series; they appear to rest upon the conglomerates of Jhab\u00e1n and these again upon the quartzites of N\u00e1rukot and D\u00e1ndi\u00e1pura. Judging from the extent of alteration the Surajpur beds are high in the group. But no base is seen, unless the quartzites of the southern patch rest upon granite about Manikpur. These quartzites much resemble those of N\u00e1rukot. It is often almost impossible to fix where the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner beds pass into metamorphics. Within the tract occupied by the metamorphic rocks, quartzites which have in no way the appearance of outliers occur in several places, as near Mirv\u00e1n\u00eda, and again west of J\u00e1mbughoda. In the latter case a true conglomerate containing large rolled pebbles of quartzite is found amongst the metamorphic rocks. The same apparent passage occurs south of Surajpur, the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner beds being more crystalline near the boundary. Faults may to a great extent account for these passages, and when rocks do not differ greatly in mineral composition apparent cases of transition are very likely to occur. Still both along and across the line of strike there is, in places, an apparent gradual change from Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner beds into metamorphics.\n\nSouth of the belt of hills near Kadv\u00e1l, and around J\u00e1mbughoda nearly all the surface is composed of granite, passing occasionally into granitoid gneiss. North-west and west of this plain, the hills of N\u00e1rukot and D\u00e1ndi\u00e1pura consist of the quartzite and conglomerate of the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner group. South-west of J\u00e1mbughoda the rocks, although somewhat similar in composition, are more highly metamorphosed, the bedding, in places, as near Pepia being obliterated. In M\u00e1s\u00e1b\u00e1r hill near Pepia, a spur running to the east consists of very quartzose gneiss, containing large rounded masses of quartz and other rocks. It is evidently a metamorphosed conglomerate, and a rock of precisely similar constitution though unaltered abounds in the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner beds.\n\nSome good exposures of the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner beds are seen on the road from J\u00e1mbughoda to Surajpur. The range of hills north of the\nroad, at the extremity of which is N\u00e1rukot, is formed of a fine granular quartzite sandstone, vertical or dipping at a very high angle to the southward. Similar rocks form the hills to the north near D\u00e1ndi\u00e1spura and indeed the latter have much the appearance of being composed of the same great bed, which rolls over to the north of the N\u00e1rukot range and then appears to turn up again.\n\nSouth of N\u00e1rukot granite and gneiss occur in the valley, and in the hills to the south, but at A'nanpur slates and conglomerates come in, vertical or dipping south, and apparently resting upon the quartzites of the N\u00e1rukot range. They are probably faulted against the gneiss. The slates are in places well cleaned and fine grained and might yield good roofing slate.\u00b9\n\nAt Tuva, about ten miles west of Godhra, hot springs rise to the surface in two places, the one in a river-bed, the other in a marsh. The river-bed spring, unknown and never resorted to, is found only by removing some of the surface sand. The other springs, varying in temperature and giving off gas, well up through large earthen jars let into the soil over about an acre of marshy forest-cleared land. The water is sacred to Mah\u00e1dev and the place studded with palm trees, is adorned by a temple. On the morning of Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n Sud 11 (March) especially since the opening of the D\u00e1kor railway this place is much frequented by pilgrims.\n\nExcept that in the eastern division the rains are somewhat later of beginning, the seasons are the same over the whole district; cold from November to February; hot from March to the middle of June, and rainy from the middle of June to the end of September. The prevailing winds are in Godhra from October to March east and north-east, from April to June west, and from July to September south-west, and in Dohad from October to December east and south-west, and from January to September south-west. Records of rainfall are available for two stations, Godhra in the west for twelve years (1867-1878) and Dohad in the east for seventeen years (1862-1878). From the following table it will be seen that during the twelve years ending 1878, Godhra had the highest average with 44\u00b745 inches. The greatest fall in any one year was in Godhra 64\u00b705 inches in 1878 and in Dohad 47\u00b734 inches in 1878.\n\n| Year | Godhra Inches | Godhra Cents | Dohad Inches | Dohad Cents |\n|------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| 1862 | 30            | 62           | 1871         | 44          |\n| 1863 | 26            | 11           | 1872         | 48          |\n| 1864 | 24            | 85           | 1873         | 32          |\n| 1865 | 25            | 42           | 1874         | 45          |\n| 1866 | 34            | 50           | 1875         | 46          |\n| 1867 | 35            | 15           | 1876         | 49          |\n| 1868 | 41            | 12           | 1877         | 20          |\n| 1869 | 59            | 70           | 1878         | 64          |\n| 1870 | 48            | 59           |              |             |\n\n\u00b9 Mem. Geo. Sur. VI. 3, 41, 178, 218.\nThermometer readings are registered at Godhra and Dohad. A comparison of the returns during the eight years ending 1878 shows an average temperature at Dohad on the whole slightly below that of Godhra, the figures being 80\u00b057' and 78\u00b074' respectively. The following statement would seem to show that, though the temperature is slightly lower at Dohad at all times of the year, the difference between the two stations is most marked during the hot months April, May, and June.\n\n**Panch Mahals Temperature, 1871-1877.**\n\n| Year | January to March | April to June | July to September | October to December |\n|------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n|      | Godhra | Dohad | Godhra | Dohad | Godhra | Dohad | Godhra | Dohad |\n| 1871 | Mean   | 73\u00b03 | 75\u00b01 | 91\u00b06 | 83\u00b01 | 82\u00b00 | 76\u00b01 | 73\u00b00 | 76\u00b05 |\n|      | Daily range | 32\u00b00 | 34\u00b08 | 18\u00b00 | 34\u00b00 | 4\u00b06 | 22\u00b03 | 22\u00b06 | 24\u00b00 |\n| 1872 | Mean   | 70\u00b00 | 72\u00b02 | 90\u00b08 | 88\u00b02 | 81\u00b07 | 75\u00b04 | 74\u00b03 | 77\u00b06 |\n|      | Daily range | 9\u00b06 | 34\u00b06 | 10\u00b05 | 28\u00b00 | 6\u00b03 | 12\u00b00 | 10\u00b03 | 28\u00b03 |\n| 1873 | Mean   | 75\u00b09 | 72\u00b01 | 91\u00b002 | 69\u00b06 | 81\u00b028 | 78\u00b09 | 75\u00b02 | 72\u00b07 |\n|      | Daily range | 14\u00b04 | 30\u00b00 | 13\u00b09 | 25\u00b00 | 11\u00b045 | 13\u00b00 | 27\u00b04 | 28\u00b00 |\n| 1874 | Mean   | 72\u00b08 | 72\u00b05 | 89\u00b018 | 87\u00b05 | 76\u00b05 | 79\u00b06 | 73\u00b03 | 78\u00b00 |\n|      | Daily range | 26\u00b00 | 30\u00b00 | 16\u00b00 | 26\u00b00 | 11\u00b02 | 15\u00b07 | 23\u00b04 | 33\u00b03 |\n| 1875 | Mean   | 76\u00b08 | 72\u00b07 | 92\u00b07 | 90\u00b02 | 82\u00b07 | 79\u00b03 | 76\u00b03 | 74\u00b05 |\n|      | Daily range | 24\u00b03 | 36\u00b03 | 16\u00b09 | 23\u00b03 | 10\u00b06 | 16\u00b03 | 24\u00b03 | 24\u00b07 |\n| 1876 | Mean   | 76\u00b08 | 72\u00b09 | 87\u00b085 | 89\u00b00 | 82\u00b07 | 79\u00b06 | 76\u00b09 | 74\u00b03 |\n|      | Daily range | 29\u00b00 | 34\u00b00 | 29\u00b03 | 28\u00b00 | 13\u00b06 | 14\u00b07 | 31\u00b02 | 27\u00b07 |\n| 1877 | Mean   | 73\u00b086 | 71\u00b08 | 88\u00b015 | 88\u00b05 | 85\u00b028 | 84\u00b07 | 78\u00b007 | 79\u00b09 |\n|      | Daily range | 22\u00b020 | 31\u00b00 | 22\u00b045 | 23\u00b045 | 20\u00b044 | 14\u00b07 | 18\u00b07 | 22\u00b023 |\n| 1878 | Mean   | 74\u00b081 | 77\u00b06 | 90\u00b044 | 94\u00b06 | 82\u00b012 | 85\u00b06 | 74\u00b037 | 77\u00b05 |\n|      | Daily range | 14\u00b054 | 34\u00b00 | 14\u00b041 | 18\u00b07 | 6\u00b022 | 12\u00b07 | 13\u00b094 | 22\u00b00 |\n\nIn healthiness the climate varies greatly. The well tilled parts K\u00e1lol in the west and Dohad in the east, would seem to be free from any special form of sickness and to be healthy to newcomers as well as to the people of the place. Godhra surrounded by large areas of forest and waste, though for residents fairly healthy is rather a trying climate for strangers. The hot and rainy seasons weaken Europeans, and the cutting malarious winds and hot sun of the cold months are, to natives from other districts, apt to bring on fevers of a dangerous type. The commonest forms of sickness are ague, dysentery, diarrhoea, bronchitis, asthma, guinea worm and skin-disease.\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPRODUCTION.\n\nCompared with other Gujar\u00e1t districts the Panch Mah\u00e1ls are rich in minerals. Its hills contain iron, lead and talc, and only the cost of carriage prevents the use of its stores of building stone. Iron ore of considerable richness is found in the Godhra village of P\u00e1l\u00e1npur, and near J\u00e1mbughoda and Sivr\u00e1jpur in N\u00e1rukot. Both in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and N\u00e1rukot, though unused for years, traces of old iron-smelting works remain. Lead ore is found in N\u00e1rukot, near the iron ore, and at the Khandel\u00e1v lake two or three miles from Godhra. In 1872 a specimen of the N\u00e1rukot lead ore was examined by the Government Chemical Analyser. It was reported to be a mass of nearly pure lead with a flinty covering. The lead was a definite chemical compound with 86\u00b76 per cent of metal. It was poor in silver yielding only five ounces to the ton of lead. Two years later (April 1874) a larger collection of specimens gave an average of 58\u00b791 per cent of metallic lead and very nearly the former small proportion of silver. These results the Superintendent of the Geological Survey thought unpromising, and no attempt has since been made to work the Panch Mah\u00e1l lead mines. Talc is found near some of the N\u00e1rukot hills. But the plates are too small to have any commercial value. Of stones, sandstone, trap, quartz, coarse granite, basalt, limestone and lime gravel, kankar, are found in many parts of the district. Mr. Little, the District Executive Engineer, with the view of starting by the lately opened (1876) P\u00e1li railway an export of building materials to Ahmedabad, Baroda, and Broach, has made the following calculations of the cost of the chief varieties of stone. A very useful stone for paving and building from two to three feet square and from one to three inches thick quarried at B\u00e1garv\u00e1da, three miles from Jh\u00e1lod, costs at the P\u00e1li railway station, according to thickness, from \u00a31 10s. to \u00a33 (Rs. 15 - Rs. 30) per 100 superficial feet. The same stone would cost at Baroda from \u00a31 12s. to \u00a33 8s. (Rs. 16 - Rs. 34), at Ahmedabad from \u00a31 14s. to \u00a33 12s. (Rs. 17 - Rs. 36), and at Broach from \u00a31 16s. to \u00a33 16s. (Rs. 18 - Rs. 38). Another useful sandstone has lately been found in the Mahi river, about two miles from the P\u00e1li railway station. Limestone, with about ninety per cent of lime, is found at Dohad, and an inferior sort near J\u00e1mbughoda. A better placed limestone is about four miles from the P\u00e1li railway station. This has been burnt and gives very good lime, not hydraulic, but well suited for ordinary building.\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 100-105 and 113,114.\n2 Bom. Gov. Res. 3877, 8th July 1874.\npurposes. Some specimens mixed with sand and pounded brick and subjected to strain gave the following results. A sample of six parts, two of lime, three of sand and one of pounded brick, broke at a strain of 52\u00b715 pounds to the superficial inch; a sample of three equal parts of lime, sand and pounded brick, stood 60\u00b793 pounds; and a sample of four parts, two of lime and one each of sand and pounded brick, stood 71\u00b734 pounds. The cost of wood fuel at the quarries is about 7s. (Rs. 3-8) a ton, and the cost of the lime about 14s. 6d. (Rs. 7-4) a ton. It could be delivered at Baroda at about \u00a31 1s. (Rs. 10-8) and at Ahmedabad at about \u00a31 2s. (Rs. 11) a ton. The quality of the lime is said to be strongly in its favour. The common Godhra granite, found about nine miles from the P\u00e1li railway station, is a fine lasting stone. At the same time it is costly to work and is not likely to be used to any large extent. Plenty of fine black close-grained basalt is found near P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hill. But this, dear to work and far to bring, is not for many years likely to be in demand. Stone well suited for road metal is found within less than a mile of the P\u00e1li station. Lying in slabs and boulders it wants no blasting. The present cost of digging and breaking to pass through a ring 2\u00bd inches in diameter is 4s. 6d. (Rs. 2-4) or adding tools 5s. (Rs. 2-8) the 100 cubic feet. At a mile rate of \u00bed. (6 p.) this would give a cost per ton of \u00a31 1s. 3d. (Rs. 10-10-0) at Baroda, \u00a31 5s. 9d. (Rs. 12-14-0) at Ahmedabad, and \u00a31 12s. 3d. (Rs. 16-2-0) at Broach. Sand is found in nearly all the rivers.\n\nField Trees.\n\nThe east is rather bare of trees, but in other parts the Panch Mah\u00e1ls are well wooded. In the more highly tilled western districts, are rich well-grown rows of field trees, and large tracts in the centre are woodland and forest. The trees that give the cultivated lands in the west a rich park-like appearance are the mango, mah\u00fada, tamarind, r\u00e1yan, and banian. Of these the mah\u00fada, Bassia latifolia, with its strongly veined leaves and its heavy sickly smelling flowers is in every respect a noble tree, and of great value to the district. For some months in the year its flower and fruit are meat and drink to many of the poorer classes, and its timber is of excellent quality. The mango and tamarind do not differ from the same trees elsewhere. The r\u00e1yan or khirnt, Mimusops indica, a poor scrubby tree in the Konkan and not known in the Deccan, grows here in the greatest beauty. For so large a tree the leaves are small. They are of a deep green, and so close together, that for shade there is no tree like the r\u00e1yan. In form it is compact and well rounded, and very often grows in remarkably pretty clusters. Neither flower nor fruit is at all conspicuous. The fruit is of the greatest value, forming for Kolis and other poor classes the chief article of food during the hot weather months. Its tough wood serves as cartwheels and oil mills. But from its importance as a fruit-bearing tree the timber is seldom used. The vad, Ficus\n\n1 Contributed by T. D. Little Esquire, Executive Engineer.\n2 These notes on the Panch Mah\u00e1ls trees, shrubs, and plants are by Mr. Nairne, lately of the Bombay Civil Service. They are incomplete, as Mr. Nairne was not in the eastern parts of the district, and did not pass a rainy season in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. Mr. Nairne's notes on field and forest trees have been supplemented by contributions from Captain Macrae, Conservator of Forests, and Mr. Wilson, C. S.\nbengalensis, does not differ from the same tree elsewhere. Other common members of the fig family are the *pipri*, Ficus tsieia, the *umbar* or *gular*, Ficus glomerata, with clusters of red fig-like fruit, eaten by Bhils and Kolis, and the *pipal*, Ficus religiosa. In the K\u00e1lol sub-division rows of palmyra trees, Borassus flabelliformis, many of them encircled by a *pipri* at once attract notice.\n\nExcept the *mahuda* none of those mentioned above can be called forest trees. Of the Panch Mah\u00e1l forest trees, besides the *mahuda*, the most abundant are the teak and the *kh\u00e1khr\u00e1*. Teak, *s\u00e1g*, Tectona grandis, remarkable nearly all the year for the grand size of its leaves, is very plentiful, but except in the sacred village groves or *m\u00e1luv\u00e1n*, is of no great size. Its wood is used chiefly for rafters and small beams. The *kh\u00e1khr\u00e1*, Butea frondosa, like the teak of no great size, is remarkable at the beginning of the hot weather for its gorgeous masses of flowers. A waving well wooded country, set thick with bright scarlet-flowering apple trees, gives some idea of many a Panch Mah\u00e1l landscape when the *kh\u00e1khr\u00e1* is in bloom. In habit of growth it is not unlike the apple tree, and the leaves dropping when the flowers come, the top and outer branches stand out sprays of unbroken scarlet. In the bud the dark olive green velvet of the calyx is scarcely less beautiful than the full flower. The gum of the *kh\u00e1khr\u00e1* is gathered by N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s, its roots made into ropes, and its wood used as fuel. *S\u00edsu*, Dalbergia latifolia, neither plentiful nor large, is found in H\u00e1\u00f3l, Dohad, and Jh\u00e1l\u00f3. The *tan\u00e1s*, Ougeinia dalbergioides, with its much prized wood, is not common. The *s\u00e1dar* or *ayan*, Terminalia arjuna, is pretty plentiful, but as all the big trees were cut before the forests were closed, it is of small size. The *bibla*, Pterocarpus marsupium, though less destroyed than the *s\u00e1dar*, is by Ch\u00e1rans and other professional herdsmen often cut that cattle may feed on its leaves. It yields very fine timber. The *moka*, Schrebera swietenioides, is a common and large growing tree. Its white close-grained wood is much used by turners and for cartwheels. The *kasumb*, Schleichera trijuga, with small white flowers in February and March, is very rare. Its fruit is eaten and made into oil. Its hard wood is so much prized for cart-axles and field tools that all trees of any size have been cut. *Rohen*, Soymida febrifuga, a large and common tree, has timber too heavy for general use. *Dh\u00e1vda*, Anogeissus latifolia, is very plentiful. Though it does not rank as a timber tree, it makes excellent fuel, and is used for ploughs. *Charohi*, Buchanania latifolia, with broad oval leaves, small greenish white flowers, and a very hard nut, is not very common. Its fruit is eaten, and the oily kernel of the nut is much used in sweetmeats. The *bida*, Terminalia belerica, is one of the commonest and largest growing of Panch Mah\u00e1l trees. Its small oblong egg-shaped fruit the beleric myrobolam is used in tanning. The *gugal*, Boswellia serata, is a common, and, though not very large, a very beautiful tree. Its narrow pointed leaflets and drooping branches give it something the look of the English garden acacia. Its grey flakey bark is noticeable. It yields a cheap resin, and, besides for fuel, its wood is used in making platters. With it grows the Camarium\nstrictum, also called gugal, rather stouter, without the papery bark or the elegance of branch and leaf. The pasi, Dalbergia paniculata, is a well-grown and handsome tree with thick dark grey bark and dense foliage. The flowers are small, in large clusters, white tinged with blue. Its wood is used only for fuel. The last three are bare in February and March. The graceful nim, Melia indica, is well known, and besides near villages is sometimes found in the forests. It is seldom used as timber. Two trees of the orange family, and one of a family closely allied, may be noticed together. The kautha or wood-apple, the bel and the hinger. The hinger, Balanites roxburghii, is the commonest and the least handsome. It grows everywhere, and is often little more than a thorny bush. It yields an oil, and its nut is hollowed and made into crackers. The bel, Aegle marmelos, is a better though not very noticeable tree. Its wood is used for oil mills. The wood-apple, kautha, Feronia elephantum, when well grown, with its crowd of small leaflets and graceful drooping branches, is particularly beautiful. The fruit is eaten raw, preserved, and used medicinally, but is too common to have any sale value. The baval, Acacia arabica, except where planted by roadsides, is seldom found. The commonest acacia seems to be the anjar, Acacia tomentosa, known by its soft hairy-shaped pods. The bava, Cassia fistula, whose lovely laburnum-like flower clusters are well known in the Konkan and other forests, is also not uncommon. The dol\u00e9 or white saras, Albizzia lebbek, and the shembar, Albizzia stipulata, are also fairly common. The first with large white flowers and many protruding stamens has no particular beauty; the latter has flowers of the same size or larger, and of a beautiful pink. The pods of both are large and exceedingly thin, and the leaves doubly sub-divided. The kalli or black saras, Albizzia odoratissima, is remarkable for its apricot-scented green-worsted-like flower-tassels. Its wood is used for cart wheels. The kher, Acacia catechu, is plentiful, but, from want of preservation, does not grow large. Much of it is used in making charcoal. The other leguminous trees are the samra, Prosopis spicigera, well described as a mange-struck baval tree, and the karanj, Pongamia glabra, found chiefly on the banks of streams. Though not so handsome as in the Konkan, the foliage of the karanj is thick and polished, and it bears clusters of half-open pale lilac flowers, and flat nearly oval pods. The seeds yield an oil useful in itch. Other trees deserving mention are the bor, Zizyphus jujuba, known everywhere, but of no beauty, the fruit used as a pickle and conserve; the aduso, Ailanthus excelsa, a large tree with very rectilinear branches rather sparingly clothed with very large much divided leaves; and the silk cotton trees shimal, or shimar, Bombax malabaricum, and shamla, Eriodendron anfractuosum, similar in appearance but differing in flower, those of the first a dull crimson and those of the second a dirty white. The leaves of about five oval pointed leaflets palmately disposed fall when the flowers come. Besides being used for firewood, the trunk is hollowed into canoes, troughs, and water conduits. The kari, Sterculia urens, of the same family, is, in the cold weather, one of the quaintest of trees with its\nsmooth deadly pale bark picked out with pink patches and its leafless branches with at the tips clusters of small yellowish brown flowers. The unripe fruit is like a crimson velvet star-fish. Three of the Apocynaceae are much like each other. The kara, Wrightea tinctoria, with handsome clusters of white jasmine-scented flowers and long thin seed vessels hanging down in pairs, and often joining at the ends. A second, name unknown, like the kara in fruit, is of a different habit of growth, the leaves only half as long, broader and downy, the flower more delicate than the kara blossom with a peculiar spicy scent but without the long tube to the corolla. The third, Wrightea tomentosa, has leaves as large as the first, but downy, and the double seed vessels, instead of being smaller than a quill, are as thick as a walking cane, and dotted with roughish specks. The wood is used for turning. For these two last no more definite local name is known than dudhia, a word applied to all trees with milk-like juice.\n\nThe sareru, Streblus asper, is a very common tree in hedges and about villages. It is small and scraggy with a gnarled trunk not unlike an English thorn tree. The andrak, a less common and larger growing tree, is in February covered with small round heads of yellowish flowers. It yields a fine white wood, and when cut throws from the stool several straight saplings. The kadam, Stephegyne parvifolia, except when covered with round heads of fragrant flowers, is an unnoticeable tree. In the forests it grows to a large size, and yields good timber. The kalam or nihiv, Anthocephalus cadamba, grows to be a magnificent tree. Its large leaves are heart-shaped, and its sweet-scented balls of yellow flowers are as large as small oranges. The wood is light yellow. It is not the same as the kalam used in gun factories. The v\u00e1ola, Phyllanthus emblica, has oblong leaves arranged in pairs with much regularity and grace. Its fruit, growing among the leaves and very like a slightly grooved green gooseberry, is sometimes eaten raw, but oftener pickled or taken as a medicine. The tamraj or timburni, Diospyros melanoxylon, a common tree of little beauty, has leaves and young shoots more or less rusty or downy. Its flowers are white and inconspicuous, and it bears a fruit about the size of a plum. The timra, Diospyros montana, common only in the P\u00e1v\u00e1gad woods, is much like the tamraj, except that its fruit is of the size of an apple. The wood is used for making carts. The netar sing, Spathodea falcata, a rather uncommon tree, has pinnate leaves, white and pretty flowers, and curved and twisted pods, about eighteen inches long, and not more than an inch broad. The aledi, Morinda exserta, is a common tree, from whose bark and roots a yellow dye is made. Its pretty yellow wood is used only as fuel. The aniar, name unknown, is used sometimes for cart wheels, but generally for fuel. The leaves of the asopala, Polyalthea longifolia, are used for covering marriage booths, and those of the asindri or asotri, Bauhinia racemosa (?) for making cigarettes. The fibre of the ateri, Bauhinia speciosa (?) is made into ropes. The dried fruit of the mendal is placed on the bridegroom\u2019s wrist, and a decoction of it is used medicinally. The kaledi is common. It yields a low-valued gum, and from its wood platters are made. The bamboo,\nv\u00e1s, Bambusa arundinacea, is not large, but is pretty plentiful in hilly ground in the north-east of Godhra. In several parts of the district there are remains of old bamboo forests, and in low lands along river banks it would probably grow well and yield a large revenue.\n\nThe shrubs fall into the natural division of erect growers and climbers. Among the first perhaps the three commonest, sometimes growing to the size of small trees, are the onkla, the sit\u00e1phal or wild custard apple, and the k\u00e1l-ambar. None of these are in any way remarkable in appearance. The onkla, Alangium lamarckii, has willow-shaped leaves, and in the hot weather rather pretty whitish flowers, with very long stamens. The wild custard apple, Anona squamosa, said to be a foreigner, grows wild all over the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. The fruit is scarcely worth eating. The k\u00e1l-ambar, Ficus asperrima, is the fig with large and exceedingly rough leaves, often used as sand paper. Its greatest peculiarity is that, at least when young, the branches are jointed and hollow. The kada, Holarrhena antidysenterica, a small tree, when not in blossom hard to tell from a shrubby Wrightea tinctoria, has larger but less handsome white flowers. Its wood is used for small rafters. Melanthesopsis patens is another very common shrub, tall and spreading with small and thickly placed leaves. Neither flower nor fruit are at all remarkable. The madars, Calotropis gigantea and C. procera, are as common as everywhere else, and always in flower. The next two are commoner here than in most places. Leonotis nepecofolia grows as much as eight feet high, and is seen everywhere near villages and hedgerows. It is easily recognized by its unbranched stems with velvety orange coloured flowers in globular clusters clasping the upper part of the stem at intervals. Clerodendron phlomoides is a spreading hedge shrub, whose white flowers in December make it look at a distance like a hawthorn bush. Another very common hedge shrub is Barleria prionitis, whose buff flowers would be thought handsome, if there were more of them. Like the well known karonda, Carissa carandas, also found in hedges it is very thorny. The gaudiest shrub is perhaps the aval, Cassia auriculata, said to be common all over India. Its very handsome bright yellow flowers and the size of the shrub make many a piece of waste look at a distance like an English gorse-clad common. Two other Cassias, occidentalis and tora, like the rest of the family, covered in the rains with yellow flowers, are very common. They are chiefly remarkable for their exceedingly nasty smell. The wild indigo, nil, Indigofera tinctoria, is a shrub, from two to three feet high with inconspicuous flowers. Two much larger leguminous shrubs are tolerably common and conspicuous in hedges, kachki, Caesalpina bonduc, and chil\u00e1ri, Acacia intsia. The kachki has spikes of yellow flowers and flat oval pods, covered with prickles, and the chil\u00e1ri round heads of white flowers and showy clusters of thin, dark-red pods, about six inches long by one broad. Both of these, especially the chil\u00e1ri, are to some extent climbers. Zizyphus nummularia is very common and thorny. Except that it is a low shrub, spreading close to the ground, this is exactly like the common bor, Zizyphus jujuba. The graceful tamarisk, Tamarix ericoides,\nwell known in English sea-side places, grows commonly in the beds of rivers and on river banks. The *dhavri*, Woodfordia floribunda, is a small shrub, the flowers used as a red dye. The last to be mentioned are *bichu akara*, Martynia diandra, an annual herb and a foreigner, found often in and about cultivated ground, with a handsome foxglove shaped flower, and a curious fruit like a beetle with two sharp horns; *Cadaba indica* with white flowers of little beauty, and a scarlet fruit like a pod, and *Petalidium barlerioides*, a big straggling shrub, with handsome wide-mouthed white flowers and large green veined bracts.\n\nOf climbers, two or three, found in almost all districts, must first be mentioned. Cowitch, *kawaj*, Mucuna pruriens, has S shaped pods, closely covered with brown stinging hair. The flowers are a lurid purple, and though large are not striking. Another common leguminous climber is *gavria*, Canavalia ensiformis, with rather large pink flowers and thick heavy pods. *Cocculus villosus* is exceedingly common, and spreads widely. The leaves are small, oval and downy, and, until the small red berries come, nothing about it is very noticeable. *Dombia extensa* is also a hairy climber, of no beauty, though it bears white flowers nearly all the year round. Like all the family, it is full of bitter milk, and the double seed vessels are covered with soft prickles. The beautiful *Clitoria ternatea*, with blue shell-shaped flowers, is common in hedges, and so is the *guraj*, the smaller Abrus precatorius. Its flower is inconspicuous, but after the pod has burst, the bright red seeds shine out from every hedge. The *tamanya*, Vitis carmusa, with three distinct stalked, serrated leaflets and clusters of soft black-currant-like berries, is not so common as in the Konkan. Another pretty, though not very striking climber, is *Boerhavia repanda*, with very small pink flowers on long stalks and smooth heart-shaped leaves. Perhaps the largest of the climbers is the *bika*, Ventilago madraspatana, with at the end of green far stretching branches, clusters of small flowers and pea-shaped fruit with a long thin wing attached to it.\n\nOf the Convolvuli, the elephant creeper, *Argyreia speciosa*, and the common but pretty *Ipomoea sepia* with pale pink middle-sized flowers, and heart-shaped leaves, are the only climbers that can be recognized in the cold weather. Of *Cucurbita taceae*, Lehneria garcini, is in some places common in hedges, the leaves with their five much separated round and toothed lobes, are rather curious looking, and so are the small deep-red horizontally egg-shaped berries. *Mukia scabrella*, also a small climber, very rough with minute yellow flowers and small scarlet berries, is one of the very common Indian hedge plants. The *r\u00e1n turai*, Laffa amara, climbs high, and has largish yellow evening-blooming flowers, and oblong ribbed fruit, which, during the greater part of the year, hangs in the hedges, dry and brown. The *dilori*, Cephalancha indica, perhaps the commonest Konkan hedge plant, grows in the Panch Mah\u0101ls, but not freely. It has handsome white flowers and an oblong fruit, so beloved by birds and squirrels that it scarcely ever ripens to its proper scarlet. Of Capers, *Maerna corenaria*, the only climber has small green flowers, and\nirregular shaped in no way remarkable fruit. The only climber that calls for mention is the very small but exceedingly pretty balloon vine, Cardiospermum alicacabum. Its finely cut leaves and tendrils, its small white flowers on long stalks, and inflated three-lobed capsule enclosing three round black white-spotted seeds, make nearly every part of it noticeable.\n\nTo arrange plants and draw the line between them and shrubs is not easy. For grouping, as well as recognition, perhaps the simplest plan is to take them according to the locality they thrive best in, water, marsh, and dry-land.\n\nOf water plants, found in or on ponds and river-bed pools, the three sorts of waterlilies are tolerably well known. First, the large Nelumbium speciosum, whose leaves and pink or white flowers grow on stalks, sometimes three or four feet long; second, the ordinary white or red Nymphaea lotus; and third, the Nymphaea stellata, about the same size as the last but often blue as well as white or red, and distinguished from it by the petals and sepals being more pointed and the anthers having white appendages. Perhaps the next commonest, found in any ditch, is the Convolvulus Ipomoea reptans, with long creeping and rooting stems, pretty rose-coloured flowers, and arrow-shaped leaves. The water chestnut or shingodi, Trapa bispinosa, is not very conspicuous, but the flowers are white, the leaves arranged in whorls, and the fruit long stalked, irregularly angled, and with two sharp horns straight and barbed. Another plant, creeping under and on the water to a long distance, is Irissida repens, with bright green leaves, red stems, and primrose coloured flowers, opening like the rest of the family in the evening. Sagittaria obtusifolia, named from the arrow-shaped leaves of the germs, has long tapering points to the lower ends of the leaves, which rise out of the water on very long stalks. The flowers are white but make little show. Round the edges of all ponds and pools are seen patches of Hygrophila longifolia, a rigid plant, about two feet high, with narrow leaves and handsome blue unstalked flowers, each cluster surrounded by six long thorns, with small round lotus-like leaves and clusters of cup-shaped flowers, growing out of the leafstalk. Next are two species of Limnanthemum or water buck bean. The larger, Limnanthemum indicum, has plain white flowers, bearded on the margin; the smaller, Limnanthemum aurantiacum, white flowers, the throat much bearded, and of a deep orange colour. Of the order Scrophulariaceae two smaller plants almost always grow with the water buck beans; of these one is Limnophila gratioloides with pale purple flowers and leaves of three different sorts, those under water in hair-like masses, those just above the water divided into lobes and surrounding the stem, and those at the top simple lance-shaped. The other, Herpestes monnieria, has also pale half-opened flowers, but is without the peculiarity of three different sets of leaves. Another very common plant that grows in masses in moist places is Ammania baccifera, the stems are square and tinged with red, and its whole leaf arrangement is remarkably regular. Neither flower nor fruit is noticeable. With this is often seen a small plant of the Cruciferous or cabbage and water-cress\nfamily, Cardamine hirsuta, with erect pods. This to look at is a common plant, and is only noticed because it grows in England. The beautiful little hooded milfoil, Utricularia stellaris, only two or three inches high, with bright yellow flowers, rising on very slender stems and hair-like leaves, is found spreading over wet ground, and is properly an aquatic, though half an inch of water is enough for it. Two of the goose-foot tribe, Polygonum rivulare and Polygonum elegans, must be noticed. The first is a smooth straight plant with lance-shaped leaves and a head of flowers not unlike an ear of wheat. The second spreads flat on the ground, and is easily known by its very small deep-red flowers and ragged white stipules. It has altogether something the appearance of a heath.\n\nThis seems to conclude the list of aquatic flowering plants, but it may be remarked that in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, as elsewhere, the commonest plant that grows in and near water is a non-flowering pepper-wort, Marsilea quadrifolia, whose leaves are of the exact quatre-foil shape. There are many non-flowering duckweeds and sedges.\n\nAfter water come marsh plants. In the Panch Mah\u00e1ls besides on river banks and beds, during the cold weather, marsh plants clothe with green the empty rice-fields. They are all of small size. The largest and one of the commonest is perhaps C\u00e6sulia axillaris, whose flowers of a pretty lilac and white, grow in close heads, attached to the dilated base of the leaves. With it is often found Cyathoclina stricta, a delicate plant, with pretty much divided hairy and strong smelling leaves, and reddish purple small flower heads. Another is Spheronthus mollis, very common on rice fields, with a strong balsamic smell, but by no means beautiful. The flowers are in dull red heads, nearly as big as a marble, and the leaves below the meeting with the stem run down it in wings. A fourth, of the same order (Composite), a very common weed everywhere, is Eclipta alba with white flowers; and a fifth, coming out rather late in the cold weather but in the same moist lands, is Gnaphalium indicum, a small soft hairy plant of a light grey hue, and with small straw-coloured heads of flowers. This is very like the English Gnaphalium. Heliotropium ovalifolium is also very common on rice fields, with velvety much wrinkled leaves and small white flowers. Stringa euphrasioides is another small plant, rough all over with rather pretty white flowers, the tube long and very narrow. Lobelia trigona, another very small plant, with the peculiarity of three cornered stems and stamens protruding through a slit in the lower lip of the corolla, is also common. Finally, of rice-field plants is Sutera glandulosa, not mentioned in any Bombay books, but given by Drury as a Central Indian plant. It is very small with finely-cut leaves and pale flowers, and is hairy and glutinous all over. Stemodia viscosa is another rice-field plant, small, sticky, and with dark blue flowers. There is also the small gentian, Exacum pumilum, known by its square stem with smooth opposite leaves, and very pretty starlike dark-blue flowers, with large yellow anthers.\n\nOf dry-land plants, two small Convolvuli may first be mentioned, both of them found creeping on the ground in grassy or sandy places.\nEvolvulus hirsutus has flowers of the loveliest blue, smaller, but rather like those of the common English speedwell. This is not much like an English convolvulus, but Convolvulus microphyllus is very like the common English bindweed, and no one could mistake it for a member of any other family. Another beautiful English plant, found occasionally, is the common pimpernel, Anagallis arvensis, but instead of scarlet the Indian variety has flowers of a splendid dark-blue. Two stout plants of the nightshade order are very common here as elsewhere, Solanum jacquinii and Solanum indicum with flowers much like those of the potatoe. The second is the larger, almost a shrub in size. Both are prickly with, especially the first, spike-covered leaves. A third Solanum without prickles, and smooth all over, is Solanum nigrum. This, much rarer than the others, is found in England, and like the common nightshade has small flowers. Another plant, which about cultivated fields grows as much as five feet high, is the kalpa, Trichodesma amplexicaule, rough all over, like most of its order, with rather pretty lilac-coloured flowers. Of Compositae, which are not often remarkable for beauty, we have Echinops echinatus covered all over with prickles, and clearly of close kin to a thistle. It is all over of a grey hue, and the small whitish flowers are in large round heads. Another purple thistle, more like the blue beetle thistle of England, is Tricholepis procumbens, which straggles over sandy ground. Perhaps the commonest of Compositae is the Vicoa auriculata, with small yellow camomile-like flowers on long stalks, and rather narrow much wrinkled leaves. The strong smelling and very hairy stout plant, with small yellow heads of flowers, is Blumea holosericea. Launaea bellidifolia is common in sandy ground, with much resemblance in its light yellow flowers and deeply gashed leaves to a milk thistle. These, with several already said to flourish in damp ground, make up a tolerable list of Compositae. Elephantopus scaber is nothing better than an impostor. At the beginning of the rains it puts forth close to the ground a number of primrose-like leaves. For two or three months it shows no flower, and then a long stiff stem shoots up, with, at the top, a remarkably ugly head of purple flowers. Perhaps this is the place to mention the yellow Mexican thistle, though it is not a thistle but a poppy, Argemone Mexicana. It is as common here as everywhere else, and not the least like a foreigner.\n\nOf Capers, Cleome viscosa, a weed in most districts, is found here. It is hairy and sticky all over with leaves of three or five leaflets, yellow flowers, and a long erect pod-like fruit. Gynandropsis pentaphylla is less common; it has something of the same appearance, but is altogether more agreeable, the white flowers being rather pretty. Of Scrophulariaceae, Celsia coromandeliana is a stout plant growing in waste places, whose leaves and flowers are much like the English mullein. Verbascum Lindenbergia urticfolia is a small downy plant, growing out of old walls and rocks; the small yellow flowers are something like snapdragons. Of the large order of Acanthaceae, the characteristics of which are generally well marked, the handsomest is Daedalacanthus nervosus, with spikes of very pretty violet or blue flowers with darker stripes, much contracted in the throat. Ruellia\nelegans is a small, but in favourable situations very pretty plant with bright blue bell-shaped flowers marked with reddish stripes. Haplanthus verticillaris has flowers rather like the last, but is a larger and coarser plant, and the flowers are surrounded by short and rigid, but not thorny, spines. Ruellia dijecta is a lowly plant, with rather large solitary bell-shaped blue or lilac flowers. Lepidagathis rigida is a strong hairy plant, very prickly and with much smell, the flowers in spikes white with brown spots. Blepharis baerhaeifolia is a creeping and straggling plant, with leaves in fours, and pale irregular flowers, surrounded by bristly bracts. Peristrophe bicalyculata, straggling, untidy looking, has rough hexagonal stems and small pink flowers at the end of long stalks. Justicia diffusa is a very small and very common plant, with spikes of pale blue flowers. From the bracts crowded together all up the spike, flowers emerge, with white membranous edges. Nelsonia tomentosa, a low-growing very hairy plant, with spikes of small lilac and purple flowers, may conclude this order.\n\nOf the Labiatae or mint family, the chief are two common-looking plants, found in great quantities in tilled or fallow fields, Leucas linifolia and Leucas cephalotes. They have both white flowers in globular heads and clusters round the stem. Besides other smaller differences, the first is soft and downy, and the second smooth. Leucasiibiflora, distinguished among the species of this genus by having only two flowers together in the axils of the leaves, is not so common as the other two. Salvia plebeia is a rather pretty plant with small lilac flowers, very much wrinkled leaves, and a strong mint-like smell. Nepeta Bombaiensis is not common; it is not much unlike the last. Avisorneles ovata is a tall straggling plant of little beauty, with large heavy heart-shaped leaves and purple flowers.\n\nOf Amaranths, Celosia argentina is so common in cultivated fields as to look sometimes as if it had been planted. Its spikes of shaggy often twisted flowers are of a silvery white tinged with pink. Aerva lanata has also white spikes, but they are short, blunt and woolly, as are the leaves, and the whole plant is grey. Achranthes aspera is nearly as common, and entirely without beauty, the long unclothed spikes seeming to bear little else on them beyond the bristly bracts.\n\nOf Euphorbias, the milk bush, Euphorbia neriifolia, and of Cactaceae the Opuntia dillenii or prickly pear are commonly used for hedges and roadside fencing. Baliospermum montarium is a strong coarse and untidy-looking plant, with large-toothed leaves, and three-lobed fruit, the size of a small gooseberry. Crozophora plicata has a fruit of the same shape but smaller, but the whole plant is rough and hairy, keeping close to the ground, and the leaves are dark and much wrinkled. It is necessary to mention two or three leguminous plants, though probably many more may be seen in the rains. The commonest is perhaps Crotalaria filipes, very small and very hairy, prostrate on the ground, with yellow and inflated oval legume. Indigofera cordifolia is as common, as small, as hairy and as prostrate, but the flowers are dark-red. Indigofera hirsuta, much less common, is a stout erect plant, also hairy, the flowers small and pink, but in dense racemes, and the pods stiff and erect and rather four-angled.\nOf Mallows, there is the common but handsome Urena sinuata with dark pink flowers and rounded much-lobed leaves. Sida humilis, a common looking little plant, with yellow flowers, and Abutilon graveolens, a big shrubby plant, clammy and hairy, with large orange-coloured flowers and roundish leaves.\n\nThe Panch Mah\u00e1l forests lie chiefly in the centre of the district. The west, though well wooded, has few forest trees, and the east, except fruit trees in fields and some stony hill lands in the remoter villages, is bare of timber. In the centre the Godhra woodlands stretch over undulating plains, and the sides of small granite hills, and those in H\u00e1lo\u0142 partly over plains, partly over rocky uplands, and partly on the slopes of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hill. Till 1860 the produce of the Panch Mah\u00e1l forests was in little demand. Teak was preserved. But, with this exception, on paying an export duty of less than one percent, all kinds of timber might freely be cut. The forest revenue was very small. In 1861 the construction of the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway raised the value of timber. The forests were let to a contractor, who is said to have taken out of them 100,000 sleepers. In 1863 the Conservator reported the forests well stocked with useful timber, including several kinds not generally known, and as valuable as teak. In his opinion, if protected from sixteen to twenty years, the teak alone would be worth \u00a3200,000 (Rs. 20,00,000).\n\nAt his suggestion, eight kinds of trees were protected, so far as to forbid the cutting of such as were less than four feet in girth. A small establishment at a monthly cost of \u00a39 6s. (Rs. 93) was also sanctioned. In 1870 Dr. Brandis, the Conservator General for India, examined the forests. He thought them poor, and was of opinion that grass, fuel, and building timber were the only likely sources of revenue. He recommended an increase of establishment, and one European officer, an inspector and four foresters were sanctioned. Since 1871 the forest staff has been gradually increased. At present (1878), besides the European officer, it includes seven permanent and seventy temporary men. In 1866 twenty-seven tracts, varying in area from five to 200 acres, were set apart as special Government reserves. But the system followed, chiefly from the small size of the plots, was not approved, and the work of demarcation made little progress, till in 1873 forty-two square miles were taken up as Imperial reserves. Since 1873 the work has made steady progress. In 1878 in the K\u00e1lol sub-division a total of 170 square miles has been demarcated and sanctioned, and selections of more forest land are being made. In former years the forest revenue was small, and was included under the general head of miscellaneous or sayar. In 1877 the total receipts amounted to \u00a32519 (Rs. 25,190) and the expenditure to \u00a31394 (Rs. 13,940), leaving a net revenue of \u00a31125 (Rs. 11,250). In 1877, 14,549 tons, 9857 of them timber, and 4692 firewood, passed out of the district by way of P\u00e1li. The bulk of\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Sel. LXXVII. 12.\n2 Dr. Brandis' memo. dated 13th June 1870.\n3 The Deputy Conservator of Forests (Mr. Muller) estimated the timber trade in 1870 at 23,543 cart-loads of the value of Rs. 3,53,145; of these the foreign timber passing through the district represented 19,687 cart-loads of the value of Rs. 2,94,855.\nthis supply is said to come from Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, Sunth, B\u00e1r\u00edya, and Udepur, and other states bordering on the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. It goes to Baroda, Kaira, Ahmedabad, and eastern K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. Except a small demand for b\u00e1b\u00fal by the Public Works Department and the Railway, this timber is entirely used by private house-holders. It is for the most part small, chiefly teak rafters, in the dearth of bamboos much used for roofing. Rena, a village in the Godhra sub-division, was, before the opening of the P\u00e1li railway station, the chief timber mart. Since then the trade centres at Godhra, and is chiefly in the hands of Sunni Bohor\u00e1s. Except the flowers of the mah\u00fada, Bassia latifolia, gathered in the hot months, April and May, and exported in large quantities, the minor forest produce is at present of little consequence. There is no export of honey, lac or gum, and the only colouring material of any value is the yellow bark of the aledi tree. Kolis and Bhils work as woodmen, but the only local forest tribe are the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s. These are very good workers and much used in the forest. The men's daily wage varies from 3d. to 6d. (2 - 4 as.) Women, when employed, but this is not often, earn for the day about 2\u00bdd. (1 as. 8 p.) and children 1\u00bdd. (1 as.)\n\nThe domestic animals are oxen, cows, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, and asses. Of oxen the 1876-77 returns show a total of 86,024 head. Little care is taken in breeding oxen. Compared with the neighbouring Kaira and Baroda bullocks, most of them are poor, small, and weak. At the same time they are hardy and active, and can work on the poorest fare. A pair of them costs from \u00a33 to \u00a35 (Rs. 30 - Rs. 50). In some of the larger towns is a better class of bullocks. Those belonging to the Godhra Gh\u00e1nchis, apparently a cross between the local and the large Kaira cattle, are of fair size and good draught power. Three or four pairs of them, at the rate of about twelve miles a day, will draw a wagon-load of as much as one ton and 8\u00bd cwt. (40 Bengal mans). A pair of these draught bullocks is worth from \u00a35 to \u00a310 (Rs. 50 - Rs. 100). Of cows the total is returned at 90,928, and of she-buffaloes at 31,762. Like the bullocks, the cows are poor, yielding from two to five pints of milk a day, and costing from \u00a31 to \u00a32 (Rs.10-Rs. 20). Buffaloes are common, many of them of fair size and quality. Large herds are owned by professional herdsmen of the Ch\u00e1ran caste. These men come chiefly from K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and many of their buffaloes are of the well known N\u00e1godi breed. She-buffaloes, when in milk, give from six to fifteen pints a day, and vary in value from \u00a33 to \u00a36 (Rs.30 - Rs. 60). Male buffaloes (5911) are not used either in draught or in tillage. They are either killed when young or sold in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t. Horses, returned at 3488, are seldom more than ponies in size. They are small and poor, stunted by bad keep and careless breeding. Few of them are worth more than \u00a32 (Rs. 20). Of sheep and goats the 1876-77 returns show a total of 34,080 head. Sheep are fairly plentiful. In Jh\u00e1lod and H\u00e1lo\u00ee they are generally poor, leggy, and bony with coarse wool. The western sheep show more signs of breeding, better built, fleshier, with fairly close fine wool. The chief sheep and goat breeders are wandering herdsmen, Rab\u00e1ris, Bharv\u00e1ds, and K\u00e1mali\u00e1s.\n\nChapter II.\nProduction.\nForests.\n\nAnimals.\nDomestic.\nBesides breeding, these men keep stores of clarified butter, and make some profit from wool, either selling it, or working it into coarse blankets or k\u00e1mlis. From the south-west of the district there is a small export of sheep to Baroda, and to Neemuch and Mhow from the north-west. Goats are common. But most are the rough black or red breed, of no great value as milkers. Their hair is mixed with sheep\u2019s wool in making blankets and in stuffing pillows. Of camels the 1876-77 returns show a total of 419. About the beginning of the cold season, November, large herds of breeding camels are brought from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, kept in pasturage till June, and then taken back to their own country. The breeders, M\u00e1rv\u00e1di Rab\u00e1ris, pay a grazing fee of two young camels.\n\nAsses, with a total strength of 1701, are bred throughout the district. As a rule all potters, kumbh\u00e1rs, and rice-huskers, gol\u00e1s, keep asses, the potters to carry earth and earthen pots, and the rice-huskers to carry grain. They are treated with little care, and left to pick up what fodder they can find. An average ass-load is about 160 pounds (4 mans). They vary in price from 16s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 8-Rs. 20). The domestic fowls are hens and ducks. Hens are reared chiefly by Musalm\u00e1ns, Kolis, and Bhils, in all villages and towns. Ducks are also reared but only in small numbers.\n\nAs late as the seventeenth century (1616 and 1645) the Dohad forests were famous for their wild elephants. And twenty years ago, though all traces of wild elephants had passed away, the Panch Mah\u00e1l and Rewa K\u00e1ntha districts were, besides of deer and other smaller animals, a favourite resort of tigers, panthers, and bears. Found to some extent over the whole district the larger sorts of game were commonest in Godhra, in parts of H\u00e1lo\u00ed, and along the western borders of Dohad and Jhalod. Their favourite haunts were river-bed patches of bastard cypress, Tamarisk, and especially near Godhra the caves and crevices of the low boulder-covered granite hills. The tillage area was then small, and besides stray cattle a fair stock of nilg\u00e1di, small deer, and pig, and a chance spotted deer or stag furnished plentiful supplies for the large beasts of prey. Their quiet was little disturbed, European sportsmen seldom visited the district, and from the Bhils and Kolis, except on the rare occasion of some big hunting party, the larger animals had little to fear. In 1860, when the district came under British management, the forests were full of big game, and during the next eight seasons from forty to seventy head were yearly killed. In 1865 the results of the year\u2019s shooting included twenty-two tigers, ten panthers, and thirty-eight bears. Besides this destruction, two causes, the clearing of their former haunts, and the shortening of their food supplies, have been at work to reduce the number of big game. Tillage has steadily spread, and not only the open glades, but many thick rich patches of wood on the banks of streams, where tigers used always to lie, are now well guarded.\n\n1 In 1616 the emperor Jah\u00e1ngir (1605-1627) came to Gujar\u00e1t to hunt elephants in the Dohad forests and in 1645, seventy-three elephants were caught in the Dohad and Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner forests.\nfields of tobacco and sugarcane. At the same time greater care in grazing cattle and the destruction of deer have cut down two of the chief sources of their food supply. Tigers are gradually withdrawing from their old haunts. Even in the thickest and safest covers a stray animal is only occasionally found. Panthers wanting less food and shelter give ground slower. But on them too the spread of tillage presses hard, and their numbers steadily drop off. The P\u00e1v\u00e1gad forests and the well-wooded country between P\u00e1v\u00e1gad and Devgad-B\u00e1riya still attract the largest game. But even when found, animals take shelter in caves and rocky fissures so deep that neither smoke nor fireworks can drive them out. A sportsman willing to work will probably not leave altogether empty-handed. But blank days will be the rule and success the exception. During the last four years (1874-1877) not more than ten head of large game have on an average been killed. Of Tigers, v\u00e1g, Felis tigris, two were killed in 1873, six in 1874, and three each in 1876 and 1877. The Panther, d\u00edpdo, Felis leopards, is still in considerable numbers. But the shelter among the large granite rocks is so good, that once among them panthers are very hard to dislodge. Two were shot in 1876 and four in 1877. The Leopard, chita, Felis jubatus, less common than the panther, is sometimes seen. The Black Bear, rinchh, Ursus labiatus, is found in considerable numbers. Like panthers, bears find such good shelter among the granite rocks that they are not often killed. The Hyena, taras, Hy\u00e6na striata; the Jackal, si\u00e1l, Canis aureus; and the Fox, lokri, Vulpes bengalensis, are common everywhere; the Lynx, si\u00e1gosh, Felis caracal, and the Wild Cat, b\u00e1ngad billi, Felis chaus, are comparatively rare. The Wild Boar, dukar, Sus indicus, is found everywhere in the forests. Of Deer there are the s\u00e1mbar, Rusa aristotelis, found only on the slopes of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hill; the Spotted Deer, chital, Axis maculatus, common in certain parts of the district; the four-horned Antelope, Tetraceros quadricornis, found in most places, and the Gazelle, chik\u00e1ra, Gazella bennettii, and Blue Bull, nilgai, Portax pictus, common everywhere. The Antelope, kalia, Antilope bezoartica, common over the rest of Gujar\u00e1t is, perhaps because the country is not open enough, scarcely ever found in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls.\n\nOf wild birds there are of water birds the Black-backed Goose, nukta, Sarkidiornis melanotus, the Cotton Teal, Nettapus coromandelicus; the Widgeon, Mareca penelope; the Pin Tailed Duck, Dafila acuta; the common Teal, Querquedula crecca; the Blue-Winged Teal, Querquedula circia; the Red-Headed Pochard, Aythya ferina; the White-eyed Duck, Aythya nyroca; the Tufted Duck, Fuligula cristata; the Whistling Teal, Dendrocygna javanica (Horst); the Shoveller, Spatula clypeata; and the Snake Bird, Plotus Melanogaster. Of Cranes there are the s\u00edras crane, Grus antigone; the common crane, Grus communis (Bechst); and the Demoiselle crane, Anthropoides virgo. Of Snipe the Common Snipe, Gallinago scolopacinus; the Pin Tailed Snipe, Gallinago stenura; the Jack\n\n---\n\n1 Two, the first on record, were shot in 1878.\u2014Mr. Acworth.\nSnipe, Gallinago gallinula; and the Painted Snipe, Rhynch\u00e6a bengalensis. Of Storks the Adjutant Bird, Leptoptilus angula. Of Herons the Purple Heron, Ardeola purpurea; and the Pond Heron, Ardeola leucoptera. Of other water birds the Purple Coot, Porphyrio poliocephalus; the Bald Coot, Fulica atra; and the Bittern, nari, Botaurus stellaris. Of Plovers the Indian Courier Plover, Cursorius coromandelicus; and the Stone Plover, \u00c6dienemus crepitans. Of Partridges are the Painted Partridge, Francolinus pictus; and the Grey Partridge, Ortygornis ponticeriana. Of Quail are the Grey Quail, Coturnix communis; the Rain Quail, Coturnix coromandelica; the Rock Bush Quail, Perdicula argoonda; both Button Quails, Turnices Jondera and Dussumieri; and the Bustard Quail, Turnix taigoor. Of other birds there are the Common Sand Grouse, Pterocles exustus, and the Painted Sand Grouse, Pterocles fasciatus; the Peacock, Pavo cristatus; the Red Jungle Fowl, Gallus ferrugineus, a rare bird; the Grey Jungle Fowl, Gallus sonneratii, common in Godhra; and the Red Spur Fowl, Galloperdix spadiceus.\n\nSnakes are common in the Panch Mahals, especially in and near Godhra. Four sorts are noticed as specially dangerous, the Cobra, the Chitla, the Kodya, and the Tanach Kot or Tiran, a tree viper. The Chitla's bite, though not always fatal, causes rapid mortification in the part bitten, and cases of men and animals crippled for life by a Chitla bite are common. The Kodya, though very poisonous, is said to be not always fatal. The Kot or Tanach is said to be very venomous. More than either snakes or vipers, the natives fear the Guera or biscobra. Any amount of evidence is forthcoming as to its fearfully poisonous character. They admit it has no fangs, but say the poison lies in the spittle. The number of deaths reported from snake-bites was forty-three in 1872, forty-four in 1875, thirty-nine in 1876, and sixty-four in 1877. In Gujar\u00e1t, Government rewards are granted for the destruction of the following animals: Tigers, full grown, \u00a32 8s. (Rs. 24); half grown, \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 12); cubs, 12s. (Rs. 6); Leopards, Panthers, and Chit\u00e1s, full grown, \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 12); half grown, 12s. (Rs. 6); cubs, 6s. (Rs. 3); Cobra de capello, 6d. (4 annas); Phursa or Cobra Manilla, 3d. (2 annas); other species possessing a fang in the upper jaw, \u00bcd. (6 pies). The animals are identified and the rewards generally paid by the Mamlatd\u00e1r.\n\nThe Mahi only touches a few of the western villages, and, as it has no other river, the district is almost entirely without fish. A few are found in the larger ponds and reservoirs. But the supply is too small to support a separate class of fishers.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nSince the transfer to the British a census of the Panch Mahals has twice been taken. The first in 1855 showed a total population of 143,595 souls, the second in 1872 showed 240,743 souls or an increase in seventeen years of 67\u00b765 per cent. Of the first census no details are available. At the time of the second census, of the whole number of 240,743 souls, 225,775 or 93\u00b778 per cent, were Hindus, 14,921 or 6\u00b719 per cent, Musalmans, thirty Christians, and seventeen Parsis.\n\nThe following tabular statement gives for the year 1872 details of the population of each sub-division of the district according to religion, age, and sex:\n\n| Sub-division | Not exceeding 12 years | Above 12 and not exceeding 30 years | Above 30 years | Total | Grand Total |\n|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------------|\n|              | Males | Females | Males | Females | Males | Females | Males | Females | Persons |\n| Godhra       | 14,164 | 12,141 | 12,158 | 10,554 | 9826 | 7844 | 36,148 | 30,639 | 68,787 |\n| Kalol        | 13,817 | 12,120 | 11,308 | 10,524 | 8727 | 7654 | 33,852 | 30,198 | 64,050 |\n| Dohad        | 19,973 | 19,421 | 16,951 | 16,047 | 11,480 | 11,666 | 48,404 | 46,534 | 94,938 |\n| Total        | 47,954 | 43,682 | 40,417 | 37,125 | 30,093 | 26,564 | 118,404 | 107,371 | 225,775 |\n\nMUSALMANS.\n\n| Sub-division | Not exceeding 12 years | Above 12 and not exceeding 30 years | Above 30 years | Total | Grand Total |\n|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------------|\n| Godhra       | 1429 | 1825 | 1282 | 1137 | 1065 | 975 | 3776 | 3437 | 7213 |\n| Kalol        | 434 | 383 | 471 | 375 | 383 | 315 | 1298 | 1073 | 2371 |\n| Dohad        | 906 | 863 | 1116 | 910 | 771 | 772 | 2792 | 2545 | 5337 |\n| Total        | 2769 | 2571 | 2868 | 2422 | 2229 | 2062 | 7806 | 7065 | 14,921 |\n\nCHRISTIANS.\n\n| Sub-division | Not exceeding 12 years | Above 12 and not exceeding 30 years | Above 30 years | Total | Grand Total |\n|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|-------|-------------|\n| Godhra       | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 | ... | 5 | 1 | 6 |\n| Kalol        | ... | 1 | ... | 2 | ... | 3 | ... | 3 |\n| Dohad        | 4 | 2 | 6 | 5 | ... | 14 | 7 | 21 |\n| Total        | 5 | 3 | 8 | 6 | ... | 22 | 8 | 30 |\n### DISTRICTS.\n\n#### Chapter III.

The seventeen P\u00e1rsis were Kadmis.\n\nOccupation.\n\nAccording to occupation the census returns for 1872 divide the whole population into seven classes:\n\nI.\u2014Employed under Government, or municipal, or other local authorities, numbering in all 3309 souls or 1\u00b737 per cent of the entire population.\n\nII.\u2014Professional persons, 1049 or 0\u00b743 per cent.\n\nIII.\u2014In service or performing personal offices, 1985 or 0\u00b782 per cent.\n\nIV.\u2014Engaged in agriculture and with animals, 55,047, or 22\u00b786 per cent.\n\nV.\u2014Engaged in commerce and trade, 2991 or 1\u00b724 per cent.\n\nVI.\u2014Employed in mechanical arts, manufactures, and engineering operations, and engaged in the sale of articles manufactured or otherwise prepared for consumption, 12,523 or 5\u00b720 per cent.\n\nVII.\u2014Miscellaneous persons not classed otherwise (a) wives 65,492, and children 96,984, in all 162,476 or 67\u00b749 per cent; and (b) miscellaneous persons, 1363 or 0\u00b756 per cent; total 163,839 or 68\u00b705 per cent.\n\nRace.\n\nThe general chapter on the population of Gujar\u00e1t includes such information as is available regarding the origin and customs of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls people. The following details show the strength of the different castes and races as far as it was ascertained by the 1872 census.\n\nPriests.\n\nOf Br\u00e1hmans, exclusive of sub-divisions, were thirty divisions, with a strength of 5957 souls (males 3194, females 2763) or 2\u00b763 per cent of the total Hindu population. The chief classes are Shrigaud (1838), Audich (1264), Mev\u00e1da (859), Modh (486), and N\u00e1g\u00e1r (218). Except the N\u00e1gars of whom many are holders of alienated land and recipients of cash allowances, the majority of Br\u00e1hmans live on alms. Some are peasants and a few are Government servants. The Deccan Br\u00e1hmans who, under H. H. Sindia\u2019s government held high positions numbered 222 souls.\n\nWriters.\n\nOf Writers there were two classes, Brahma Kshatris (27), and Parbh\u00fas (39), with a strength of 66 souls (males 54, females 12) or 0\u00b73 per cent of the total Hindu population. The Brahma Kshatris are employed in Government offices. New comers brought by the British at the time of the transfer of the district, they keep up houses in Broach and other parts of Gujar\u00e1t and are not yet regularly settled in the district. The Parbh\u00fas are all K\u00e1yasth Parbh\u00fas of the Deccan districts chiefly in the service of Government. They are said to have come into the district during the government of H. H. Sindia.\n\nTraders.\n\nOf Mercantile, Trading, and Shop-keeping classes, were 6688 V\u00e1ni\u00e1s belonging to sixteen divisions, 295 M\u00e1rv\u00e1di Shravaks of two\nPANCH MAHA'LS.\n\ndivisions, 621 Gujarati Shravaks of two divisions, and 59 Bhatis, a total strength of 7663 souls (males 4124, females 3539) or 3.39 per cent of the total Hindu population. In a district inhabited chiefly by the unsettled classes, the Vaniyas have many chances of making money. A considerable number of Bhils, Kolis, Naikdas, and other poor classes are wholly dependent on their Vania and Shravak money lenders.\n\nOf Cultivators, besides the Bhils and Naikdas, were seven classes with a total strength of 102,925 souls (males 54,604, females 48,321) or 45.58 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 5112 (males 2819, females 2293) were Kanbis; 5347 (males 2809, females 2538) Rajputs; 928 (males 533, females 395) Kachhiyas; 957 (males 504, females 453) Malis; 1030 (males 535, females 495) Ravals; 11,389 (males 5840, females 5549) Pateliyas; and 78,162 (males 41,564, females 36,598) Kolis. The Kanbis and Kachhiyas found chiefly in the west are said to have come from Baroda and Kaira. They are skilled husbandmen. The Rajputs though as cultivators inferior to Kanbis are steadily applying themselves to agriculture. The Malis and Ravals are superior to Koli cultivators. The Pateliyas found in Dohad claim Rajput descent. Originally settled near Pavaagad they are said to have moved from Champaran. And as among them were more men than women they intermarried with the Bhils of Gangoji. Hence they were called vatadiyas or the impure, a name which has been gradually corrupted into Pateliyas. The Kolis are found in the west. Of the whole number 75,738 were Talabdas, ninety-four Bariyas, 555 Patanvadias, 1330 Lunavadias, eighty Khant, and 207 were not classed. Strong and active in body, their want of forethought and love of opium combine to give the money-lenders the benefit of most of their labour.\n\nOf Manufacturers there were three classes, with a total strength of 718 souls (males 399 females 319) or 0.32 per cent of the total Hindu population. Of these 590 (males 320, females 270) were Ghanchis, oilpressers; 82 (males 53, females 29) Bhavsars, calico printers; 46 (males 26, females 20) Chhipas, calenders.\n\nOf Artisans there were nine classes, with a total strength of 6134 souls (males 3194, females 2940) or 2.71 per cent of the total Hindu population. Of these 608 (males 315, females 293) were Sonis, gold and silver smiths; 1020 (males 534, females 486) Suthars, carpenters; 4 (males 4, females none) Kansaras, coppersmiths; 110 (males 58, females 52) Kadiyas, bricklayers; 29 (males 20, females 9) Salats, masons; 1650 (males 866, females 784) Luhars, blacksmiths; 62 (males 32, females 30) Lakharias, makers of lac bangles; 757 (males 388, females 369) Darjis, tailors; and 1894 (males 977, females 917) Kumbhars, potters.\n\nOf Bards there were two classes, with a total strength of 1091 souls, or 0.48 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 139 (males 73, females 66) were Bhats, bards; and 952 (males 515, females 437) Charans, genealogists. The Bhats and Charans have lost their former special position and maintain themselves chiefly as husbandmen and cultivators.\nOf Personal Servants there were two classes, with a total strength of 1885 souls or 0\u00b783 per cent of the total Hindu population. Of these 1721 (males 902, females 819) were Haj\u00e1ms, barbers; 164 (males 79, females 85) Dhobhis, washermen.\n\nOf Herdsmen and Shepherds there were three classes, with a total strength of 2854 souls or 1\u00b726 per cent of the total Hindu population. Of these 1736 (males 930, females 806) were Bharv\u00e1ds; 1102 (males 613, females 489) Rab\u00e1ris; and 16 (males 15, and female 1) Ahirs. They support themselves by the sale of sheep, wool, and clarified butter; the sheep they sell to Mus\u00e1l\u00e1n traders, the wool they sell to K\u00e1mali\u00e1s or blanket weavers, and the clarified butter, ghi, to V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s. The Rab\u00e1ris own cows and buffaloes and to a small extent cultivate.\n\nOf Fishers and Sailors there were two classes with a total strength of 2228 souls (males 1190, females 1038) or 0\u00b798 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 858 (males 468, females 390) were Bhois, and 1370 (males 722, females 648) M\u00e1chhis. Bhois and M\u00e1chhis are found chiefly in Godhra. Besides fishing they till land and act as ferrymen across the Mahi. The Bhois also grow shingodi, Trapa bispinosa, in the beds of ponds.\n\nOf Labourers and Miscellaneous Workers there were eleven classes, with a total strength of 6842 souls (males 3832, females 3010) or 3\u00b703 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 191 (males 104, females 87) were Gol\u00e1s, ricepounders; 311 (males 206, females 105) Kal\u00e1ls, liquor-sellers and labourers; 286 (males 178, females 108) Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s of several castes from the Deccan employed chiefly as servants; 75 (males 40, females 35) V\u00e1ghris, fowlers and hunters; 1621 (males 850, females 771) R\u00e1vali\u00e1s, cotton-tapemakers and labourers; 27 (males 18, females 9) Bh\u00e1dbhunj\u00e1s, grain parchers; 191 (males 99, females 92) K\u00e1mali\u00e1s, makers of blankets, kamli; 1950 (males 1212, females 738) Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s; 1835 (males 929, females 906) Lub\u00e1n\u00e1s; 268 (males 144, females 124) Ods, diggers; and 87 (males 52, females 35) B\u00e1vch\u00e1s apparently of Deccan origin, labourers. The Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s, whose carrying trade has suffered by the introduction of railways, are to a pretty large extent, especially in the Marva quarter of the Godhra sub-division, beginning to settle as cultivators and day labourers. They live in separate huts not in villages, and though poor and wanting in skill are quiet and orderly. The Lub\u00e1n\u00e1s are found in Dohad. Formerly rulers of J\u00e1bua about twenty miles from Dohad they are said to have been defeated and driven out by the R\u00e1thod Rajputs. Besides tilling the ground they act as carriers taking grain from Dohad and bringing back salt.\n\nOf Unsettled Tribes there were three, with a total strength of 75,492 souls (males 38,388, females 37,104) or 33\u00b743 per cent of the total Hindu population. Of these 69,222 (males 35,086, females 34,136) were Bhils; 6118 (males 3186, females 2932) N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s; and 152 (males 116, females 36) Tal\u00e1vi\u00e1s.\n\nThe Bhils are generally very dark in colour, the men muscular, well built, and of a medium height, the women well made but with coarse irregular features. Among the men, except the top knot,\nthe hair of the head though sometimes cut short is as a rule worn long. The moustache is worn by all, whiskers by some and in most cases the chin is shaved. The women fasten their hair in braids or plaits brought low down over each temple. The Bhils have no village site or group of houses. Each man lives in his field. The Bhil\u2019s hut is usually built of bamboo wattled between supporting columns of wood and strongly plastered with grass and mud. The roof is sometimes tiled but more commonly thatched. The hut divided inside into two rooms is surrounded by a cattle-shed, a threshing floor, and a small yard for stacking grain and fodder. The whole enclosed by a strong high creeper-covered fence has a home-like and comfortable air. Of household goods the stock is small. Outsides may be seen, if the family is well-to-do, a pair or two of bullocks, or a bullock and a buffalo, a cow, or two goats, and a number of fowls, a cart, and of field tools, a plough, a weeder, kharpi, and a crowbar or ploughshare, kod\u00e1li. But most Bhils have no carts and some of them have no cattle. In the hut besides the sleeping mat, the hand grindstone, and a roll of blanket or torn coverlet, there is nothing but some bamboo baskets and a few pots and cups most of them of clay.\n\nThe Bhil\u2019s every day dress is a cloth wound round the loins and a long strip twisted round the head. In the rains and cold weather he carries a thick coarse gray blanket. The women commonly dress in a large petticoat, gh\u00e1gra, passed between the legs and tucked into the waist band before and behind. They also wear the bodice, and where they can afford it a large s\u00e1di wrapped round the body and brought over the head. They tattoo their faces, and to make room for their ornaments, pierce and slash their ears and noses till they are unpleasant to look at. Bracelets of tin or brass cover the arm from the wrist to the elbow and others of glass or lac are sometimes worn between the elbow and the shoulder. On their legs women of good family wear just below the knees a ring with small bells or rattles. Their broad brass anklets worn in tiers from the ankle to the knee weigh altogether about ten pounds and are so clumsy that the women at work in the fields have to stoop instead of sitting down. In the hot season they burn the wearer\u2019s skin and limbs. If she can afford it she usually wears a silver chain on each side of the head, fastened round the ear and hooked into the braid over the temple so as to hang over the cheek.\n\nThe every day food of a well-to-do Bhil is rice, cooked with salt and mixed in buttermilk, and of an ordinary Bhil, Indian corn and buttermilk boiled with pepper pods and sometimes split peas mixed with vegetables. Except the ass, horse, camel, rat, snake, monkey, and among women the witch-loved domestic fowl, the Bhils eat all animals. During the hot weather months the poorer classes live chiefly on mangoes, and on r\u00e1y\u00e1n, and mah\u00fada berries. Most are peasants, some of them tilling regularly, though roughly, the same fields; others are always changing their houses and lands, and a few wander among the woods and live by wood-ash tillage. Fifty years ago there were almost daily complaints of their daring aggressions.\u00b9 Though they\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov, Sel. XXIII. 321.\nare still poor and somewhat unsettled they are not as a class given to serious crime. Fifty years ago the Bhils never approached a town except to attack it. Now the streets of Dohad are crowded with Bhils trafficking with grain dealers, crowding round the money-lender\u2019s door, mixing with the people, making purchases, chatting with their friends and selling grain, vegetables, wood, and grass. Nine-tenths of the raw produce of Dohad is sown, tended, and reaped by Bhils. Many are sunk in debt. But they are no longer a tribe of outcast robbers. Among Hindus, though not considered one of the classes whose touch defiles, the Bhil holds a very low place. He eats food cooked by a Musalm\u00e1n and no high caste Hindu will take water from his hands.\n\nExcept the female deities known as m\u00e1ta or devi, Bhils do not worship the ordinary Br\u00e1hman gods. They reverence the moon and swear by it and believe in witches and in the evil eye. Their chief objects of worship are spirits and ghosts. To those in the forests near an old tree, or often at some chance spot, they offer clay horses, jars, and beehive-shaped vessels. In honour of the spirits in most of these spirit-yards they also raise beams of timber, sometimes as much as twelve feet long poised on two uprights in the form of a rough seat. Here they offer a goat and a cock; numbers of Bhils coming together to eat the sacrifice and drink. Br\u00e1hmans are not held in special respect. R\u00e1val who originally belonged to the Bh\u00e1t class act as their sacrificial priests. There is generally one R\u00e1val\u2019s family in every Bhil settlement, who, though they eat and drink with the Bhils, marry only among themselves. Among the Bhils are devotees, bhagats, and exorcists, barv\u00e1s, who leaving their families give themselves up to a religious life. These men are much resorted to for their power over ghosts and spirits. The animal they hold in most veneration is the horse. Their chief observances are in honour of the dead. Their only regular Hindu festivals are Holi (March), Dasera (September) and Diw\u00e1li (October). They fast twice in the year on Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n sud II (March) and at the Holi (March).\n\nIn the life of a Bhil are four chief ceremonies, naming, shaving, marriage, and death. Five days after a birth the child and mother are bathed and the child is named. Between two and five years old the child\u2019s head is shaved. The child\u2019s aunt takes the hair in her lap and wrapping it in her clothes receives a cow, buffalo, or other present from the child\u2019s father. A well-to-do Bhil generally gets his son married at fourteen or fifteen and his daughter before she is twelve. But, as a rule, marriage seldom takes place before the boy is twenty and the girl fifteen. The choice is made by the relations of the bride and bridegroom. In the morning of the marriage day the bride and bridegroom, each at their own homes, are rubbed with yellow turmeric powder. The bridegroom is bathed and has his eyes and cheeks marked with soot. He wears a turban, a long coat of country cloth, a waist cloth or dhotar, and a sword. The party starts with drums and cymbals to the bride\u2019s village. The women follow singing. On reaching the bride\u2019s house the bridegroom\u2019s friends are seated on one side of a mandva or booth built in front of the door. The bride is then led in by her mother and seated\nopposite the bridegroom. Their hands are joined and the hems of their garments tied. Then while three women sing songs the bride and bridegroom walk together twelve times round a branch of the salyara tree placed in the middle of the booth. When this is over the bride and bridegroom feed each other with wheaten bread and molasses. Then the knot is unloosed and after the party has taken a meal the garments of the bride and bridegroom are again tied and the bridegroom taking the bride with him returns to his house. The marriage expenses vary in the case of the bridegroom from \u00a38 to \u00a314 (Rs. 80 - Rs. 140) and in the case of the bride from 10s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 5 - Rs. 15). A man may marry a second or a third wife in the lifetime of the first. A woman marries again, not only if her husband dies but if she gets tired of him, and can bring another man to take her and pay her husband his marriage expenses. The children, if there are any, stay with the father. A Bhil youth and girl anxious to marry but unable to find the necessary \u00a37 (Rs. 70) or so, not uncommonly arrange that he should carry her off on her way to or from some fair or wedding feast. She then lives with him as his wife, and when her parents come in pursuit, an agreement is made for paying the dowry by instalments, or in some other way suited to the bridegroom's means.\n\nWhen life is gone, the relations, bathing the body, place a waist cloth, dhotar, over it, and laying it on a rough bamboo bier carry it to the burning ground. The son or other nearest relation of the deceased sets the pyre alight all round. When the body is half burnt the mourners bathe and returning to the deceased's house smoke tobacco for a short time, and after saluting each other go home. As soon as the deceased's family can raise enough money the anniversary day is held when much liquor is drunk. If the deceased was a man of importance, a year or two after his death his relations go to a stone mason and make him cut on a stone slab the figure of a man on horseback with a spear in his hand. When his task is done the mason is paid by the gift of a cow or she-buffalo. The stone is washed, daubed with red powder, covered with a white cloth, and taken to the village spirit-yard or devasth\u00e1n. There a goat is killed, its blood sprinkled on the stone, and its flesh cooked and eaten with as much liquor as the party can afford.\n\nWhen there is a great want of rain the women and girls go out dancing and singing with bows and arrows and seizing a buffalo belonging to another village sacrifice it to the goddess K\u00e1li. The headman of the village whose buffalo is taken seldom interferes. If he does the women abusing him and threatening to shoot him almost always have their own way.\n\nAmong the Bhils are many tribes or clans, some of them claiming a Rajput descent and bearing such names as Makv\u00e1na, R\u00e1thod, and Parm\u00e1r. Members of the different clans live in the same village and intermarry. Each clan has its own head or t\u00e1dv\u00e1di distinct from the Government patel. In each clan disputes are settled by a panch\u00e1yat or council of five Bhils. This council settles marriage disputes, punishes breaches of caste rules, and when the offender is penitent fixes the amount of the atonement fine. The parties interested\nin the dispute entertain the members of the panch\u00e1yat with liquor. A man is put out of caste if he behaves improperly with the wife of a relation. But if a nephew has intercourse with his father's sister or a younger brother with his elder brother's wife, it is thought no sin. A man who has intercourse with his younger brother's wife is put out of caste. The other Bhils do not eat, drink, or smoke with him. If he begs for pardon some of the leading Bhils of his village call two or three men of a sect called Vasoya and cause him to give them a present of from 10s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 5- Rs. 10). If the Vasoya allows him to drink or smoke with him the offender is let back into the caste. The Bhils have no games; drinking is their great amusement. They sometimes play a bamboo lute. But the chief musical instrument is the drum beaten at varying rates according as the occasion is sad or joyful. A string instrument of the sitar order made of half a gourd with a bamboo handle and a single wire string is also sometimes used. Though still careless and poor, the Bhils have made a considerable advance under the British Government. At the end of 1877 twenty-six of their boys were attending school.\n\nN\u00e1ikd\u00e1s's numbering 5966 souls are found only in the wildest parts of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and Rewa K\u00e1ntha. Of their origin two stories are told. One that their ancestors were grooms to the Musalm\u00e1n nobles and merchants of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, who took to the woods on the decay of that city towards the close of the sixteenth century. The other states that they are descended from an escort sent by the R\u00e1ja of B\u00e1glan to the R\u00e1ja of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. The N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s are generally small in stature, thin and wiry. They can endure a great deal of fatigue, are remarkably active, and are not wanting in courage. They are black in colour with dark eyes, square faces, and irregular features. Among both men and women the hair is worn rough and long. Their dwelling is a hut, the frame of rough timber, the walls of reeds and bamboo, generally plastered with cowdung and clay, the roof peaked and, except a few that are tiled, thatched with grass and dried teak or palm leaves. The house is divided into two parts, one for the cattle, the other for the family. In front is a platform where grass is stored and mahada flowers and ears of Indian corn are laid to dry. The property of a N\u00e1ikda family is small. Of farm stock, sometimes a few cattle and generally a goat or two and some fowls. Of field tools, a few have a plough, the rest only an axe and a hoe. Of house furniture, there is a rough stone hand mill, a long wooden pestle, and in the ground a small wood or stone mortar, and some clay pots. Except the chiefs and a few others in good circumstances who dress like Rajputs or Kolis, the men wear a few yards of dirty ragged cloth round the loins and a second cloth round the brow showing at the crown the disordered ruffled hair. The women wear over the shoulders a robe or s\u00e1di of a dark blue or red colour, a petticoat, and sometimes a bodice.\n\n1 Most of the materials for the Bhil and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1 accounts have been obtained from W. B. Prescott, Esq., Superintendent of Police, Panch Mah\u00e1ls, and R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur Nandshankar, Assistant Political Agent, Rewa K\u00e1ntha.\nExcept tin and brass earrings the men wear no ornaments. The women wear tin earrings, necklaces of beads or shells, and brass bangles and armlets in shape and make, except that they wear only one instead of many tiers, much like those worn by Bhil women.\n\nTheir chief food is Indian corn gruel; the well-to-do sometimes using coarse rice or the poorer panics. Except the ass, crow, and snake, few forms of flesh are forbidden the Naikda. They eat large black ants, squirrels, and even dead animals, and work such mischief among monkeys, or as they call them tree sheep, that even in large towns the sight of a Naikda is said to be enough to frighten off the monkeys. For months in each year, their stock of grain done, most of them live on wild fruits and roots. They are much given to mahuda spirits, and at their festivals drink to excess.\n\nThe Naikdas are labourers and wood-cutters. A few have bullocks and ploughs and till fixed fields. But with most theirs is only the rough wandering hill-side tillage, burning brushwood and among the ashes sowing the coarser panics. When the seed comes up, the Naikda raises in the middle of the clearing a rude platform on four posts and on this stays night and day watching the crop. Besides cultivating they gather the flower and berries of the mahuda tree, some medicinal roots and barks, gum, lac, honey, and wax. As woodcutters they are either hired by forest officers or by large landholders, or oftener themselves cut timber and bring it for sale to Godhra and other markets. In almost every part of the work their women help them and they seldom leave the district in search of employment.\n\nIn 1818 when they first came under British authority, the Naikdas had the worst possible name for savage cruelty. In 1826 they were said\u00b9 \u2018to exceed the Bhils in their predatory and lawless habits, in their cruelty, bloodthirstiness, and love of independence, and in the total disregard of all the customs and usages of social life.\u2019 Their chiefs used to organize forays, and engage Sidis and Makranis to help them. Numbers of cattle were collected and kept in the hills until ransomed. The proceeds of the raid were then distributed among all who had taken a part in it. In 1838 their depredations became so daring that a force had to be sent against them. For some years they were more orderly. But in 1854 they were still a peculiarly savage and predatory class living in the most remote and impervious forests. In 1868 the Naikdas were stirred up to rebellion by one of their holy men or bhagats. A force of over a thousand (1066) foot and horse with nine European officers\u00b2 was sent against them. At the beginning of the campaign their leader, whom it was believed no bullet could harm, was fortunately shot, and the rising\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Sel. XXIII. 139, 152. \u2018May the Naikdas seize you\u2019 is still a common imprecation among bullock drivers.\n\n\u00b2 The details were: of foot, of the 26th Regiment N. I. three European officers and 250 men; of the 6th Regiment N. I. three European officers and 300 men; of the 13th Regiment N. I. three European officers and 191 men; of the Gujarati Bhil corps 69; of the Gaikwar\u2019s Arabs 100; and of the Lunavada Makranis 25. Of horse there were of the Poona Horse one Risaldar and ten troopers, of the Gaikwar\u2019s mounted police 100; and 31 of the Panch Mahals, Kaira, and Ahmedabad mounted police.\nwas at an end. Since then the tribe has remained quiet and during the last two years (1875-1877) has been almost free from crime. Lazy, thriftless, and fond of drink, the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s are poor, most of them sunk in debt. The yearly income of a N\u00e1ikda family may be estimated at from \u00a36 to \u00a310 (Rs. 60-Rs. 100) and their monthly expenses at from 10s. to 14s. (Rs. 5-Rs. 7). Though they eat carrion and rank among the very lowest classes, their touch though avoided is not held to cause pollution. Except the B\u00e1r\u00eda Naikd\u00e1s, they eat with Musalm\u00e1ns but not with Dheds or Bhagi\u00e1s. Naikd\u00e1s show no respect to Br\u00e1hmans, and care little for Br\u00e1hmanic rites, fasts, or feasts. Beyond, if they can afford it, giving a dinner in their honour they perform no ancestral or shr\u00e1dh ceremonies. Except that they sometimes pour oil over Hanum\u00e1n, and, though they are not allowed to enter her temple worship the mother or M\u00e1ta on P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hill and at other local fairs, the objects of their worship are spirits and ghosts. They show no respect for the Muhammadan religion and neither worship nor make offerings at Muhammadan shrines. In honour of spirits whom they invoke by various fantastic names, they fix teak posts in the ground, roughly hacking them at the top into something like a human face. Over these posts they smear cow's milk or red lead, and round them set rows of small clay horses. The ceremonies are conducted by Koli priests or puj\u00e1ris, who while the worship is going on keep the Naikd\u00e1s at a distance.\n\nMarriage and death are among Naikd\u00e1s the only occasions of ceremony. The age for marriage, both among boys and girls, is from eighteen to twenty. To arrange a marriage the boy's father goes to the father of the girl and asks him if he will give his daughter in marriage. If he agrees, the boy's father pays him from 4s. to 10s. (Rs. 2-Rs. 5) and leaves. He then, with some friends, bringing a rupee's worth of molasses comes back. He places some molasses in the girl's hand, laying on it a rupee, and a half or a quarter anna coin. Of the rest of the molasses half and sometimes the whole is given to the friends of the girl. The wedding day is fixed by the Naikd\u00e1s after examining the stars. On the appointed day a booth of fresh leaves is built in front of the bride's house. In the afternoon with horns, drums, and cymbals, the bridegroom, with his parents and a number of relations and friends, comes to the bride's father's house. The boy's father pays the girl's father from \u00a31 10s. to \u00a35 (Rs. 15-Rs. 50), and the two families dine together, the bride's father furnishing liquor and the bridegroom's party bringing their own food. After dinner the bride and bridegroom are seated face to face in the square, or chori, in the centre of the booth, and by two old men, one from each family, called for the occasion priests or puj\u00e1ris, have their hands joined and their skirts tied. Then a sheet is thrown over their heads, and the old men give them some balls of flour and molasses. When each has twice fed the other, the cloth is drawn away and the marriage is over.\n\n---\n\n1 The common belief, says Mr. Nandshankar, is that they hold the killing of a Br\u00e1hman to be an act of merit. Referring to the feast on the thirteenth day after death their proverb says, by the death of one Tilvan or tilu, brow-mark, wearer, a hundred are fed.\nThen every one drinks as much liquor as he can, drums and cymbals strike up, and all ends in a dance, the men and women dancing by themselves. In many cases there is no ceremony of this kind. If a girl reaches the age of sixteen and her parents have not betrothed her, she may go and live with any man she chooses, and if he agrees to pay her parents from \u00a31 12s. to \u00a35 (Rs. 16-Rs. 50) no objection is raised. Again, if a woman deserts her husband and goes to live with another man he pays the husband from \u00a31 12s. to \u00a36 (Rs. 16-Rs. 60). If the husband agrees to give up his wife, he is paid nothing. A widow may marry again. On such occasions there is no ceremony. The husband presents her with a new petticoat, bodice, and robe. He comes to her house and takes her away with him. But this must be done at night, for it is the common belief that if a widow is married in the day time the village will be burnt down. A man may have at the same time more than one wife. The N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s do not intermarry with any other caste. But if a Koli woman lives with a N\u00e1ikda, or a Koli with a N\u00e1ikda woman, they are admitted into the N\u00e1ikda caste. The N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s burn their dead usually at a place some distance from their village. The corpse, wrapped in cloth, is laid on a bamboo bier and carried by men of the tribe, or in a cart, to the burning ground. When the pyre is ready, it is kindled by the deceased's nearest male relation. Nine days after the burning of the body the nearest relations go to the burning place and gathering the ashes into a heap, place on it an earthen jar full of water. On their return home, the relations of the deceased shave their heads and faces. On the same day, the person who lighted the funeral pyre cooks rice at his house. Placing this on a plate made of four leaves of the kh\u00e1khra or Butea frondosa tree, he pours a little butter over it, and then sets fire to it. Some more of the grain, laid on five leaf plates, is sprinkled with butter and given to children to eat. On the twelfth day, the family of the deceased make ready rice or panic, kodra; and Indian-corn gruel, with, if they can afford it, a little butter, and call those who were at the funeral, or if they are rich enough, they ask the whole village. The guests do not all meet at one time. They come when they like, and taking their share of the food either eat it on the spot or take it with them to their homes. Among the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s authority and power is centred in four chiefs. Of these one lives at Sivr\u00e1jpur in H\u00e1lol; a second at Gondola in the Udepur state; a third at S\u00e1gt\u00e1la in the B\u00e1riya state; and a fourth at Dandi\u00e1pura under J\u00e1mbughoda. At a moment's notice these men could between them raise the whole tribe of N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s. Except for eating with a Dhed, Cham\u00e1r, or Bhangi, a N\u00e1ikda would not be put out of caste. In such a case he would not be re-admitted unless he gave a dinner to his caste-men. During the last fifty years the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s have, as a class, made a great advance towards orderly habits. At J\u00e1mbughoda and at S\u00e1gt\u00e1la in B\u00e1riya a few of them have, since 1869, sent their boys to school, and two sons of the saint, or bhagat, hanged in 1868 enlisted in the Gujar\u00e1t Bhil corps in 1870 and are doing well.\n\nOf workers in leather there were two classes, with a total strength of 3097 souls (males 1643, females 1454) or 1\u00b737 per cent of the\n\nChapter III.\nPopulation.\nN\u00e1ikd\u00e1s.\n\nLeather Workers.\nChapter III.\n\nPopulation.\n\ntotal Hindu population. Of these 1160 (males 622, females 538) were Mochis, shoemakers, and 1937 (males 1021, females 916) were Kh\u00e1lp\u00e1s, tanners.\n\nDepressed Classes.\n\nBesides the Kh\u00e1lp\u00e1s there were three depressed classes, with a total strength of 7882 souls (males 4151, females 3731) or 3\u00b749 per cent of the whole Hindu population. Of these 575 (males 293, females 282) were Garud\u00e1s, priests to the Dheds; 4422 (males 2348, females 2074) Dheds, sweepers and carriers of dead animals; and 2885 (males 1510, females 1375) Bhangi\u00e1s, scavengers.\n\nBeggars.\n\nDevotees and religious mendicants of various names, Brahmac\u00e1r\u00eds, Vair\u00e1g\u00eds, Gos\u00e1\u00eds, and S\u00e1dh\u00fas, numbered 941 (males 504, females 437) or 0\u00b741 per cent of the entire Hindu population.\n\nMusalm\u00e1ns.\n\nIn its Musalm\u00e1n inhabitants Panch Mah\u00e1ls stand the last of the British districts of Gujar\u00e1t, with 14,921 souls or 6\u00b719 per cent of the district population. Of their whole number 7213 were in 1872 returned as settled in the towns of Godhra, 4226 in Dohad, 1663 in K\u00e1lol, 1111 in Jh\u00e1lod, and 708 in H\u00e1lol. Exclusive of 4537 females and 5325 children, in all 9862 or 66\u00b709 per cent of the whole the male adult Musalm\u00e1n population (5059) were in 1872 employed as follows: In Government or other public service 512; in professions 218; in personal service 553; in agriculture 1027; in trade 1024; in mechanical arts and manufactures 1563; and in miscellaneous callings 167. In addition to the four main divisions, Syeds, Shaikhs, Path\u00e1ns and Moghals, numbering altogether 4621 souls or about one-third of the whole, there are several classes almost all of them descendants of converted Hindus. Of these the Gh\u00e1nchis and Bohor\u00e1s are the most important. The Gh\u00e1nchis or oilmen known as Gh\u00e1nchi Bohor\u00e1s numbering 4461 souls and found chiefly in the Godhra sub-division were originally Hindus, probably of the Gh\u00e1nchi caste. They claim to be the followers of a certain Mansur, and are said to abhor all other Musalm\u00e1ns and to be well inclined towards Hindus. They had formerly the entire command of the carrying trade through the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, travelling east as far as Ratlam and Indor and west to Ahmedabad, Broach, and Surat. Since the opening of the P\u00e1li branch of the Bombay and Baroda railway they go no further than between Central India and P\u00e1li. The change has interfered greatly with their former occupation. Near Godhra several of the Gh\u00e1nchis have begun to settle down as cultivators. The Shia Bohor\u00e1s number 3126 souls, 2343 of them of the D\u00e1udi and 783 of the Sulem\u00e1n\u00ed sects. They live in towns and carry on a large trade in grain and other articles. As a class they are well-to-do.\n\nP\u00e1rsis.\n\nOf the total P\u00e1rsi population of seventeen souls, eight were settled in the Godhra sub-division, two in Dohad, four in K\u00e1lol, and three in H\u00e1lol. Exclusive of five women and one child, the adult male population were employed in 1872 as clerks in Government offices and engaged in liquor and other trades.\n\nChristians.\n\nOf the twenty-four Christians, six were European officers and most of the rest their servants.\nWith the exception of the people of two towns numbering 22,107 souls or 9\u00b718 per cent of the entire inhabitants, the population of the district, according to the census returns of 1872, lived in 661 villages with an average of 329\u00b776 souls per village. Only Vejalpur in the Godhra sub-division is walled. A Koli village generally consists of a single street or road between two rows of mud huts. The line of houses is often broken by a yard for cattle or for grain or perhaps by a well. At one end of the village is in most cases an old tamarind or mango tree, its stem surrounded by a small stone and earth platform where the village council meets, matters of common interest are talked over, and disputes settled by the headman. The poorer Kolis and almost all Bhils and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s do not live in villages. Each has a separate dwelling and in many parts of the district they move from place to place. Of the whole number of villages 324 had less than 200 inhabitants;\u00b9 220 from 200 to 500; eighty-five from 500 to 1000; twenty-four from 1000 to 2000; six from 2000 to 3000; and two from 3000 to 5000. As regards the number of houses there was in 1872 a total of 56,922, or on an average 32\u00b788 houses to the square mile. Of the total number, 7482 houses lodging 22,427 persons or 9\u00b732 per cent of the entire population at the rate of three souls to each house, were buildings with walls of fire-baked bricks and roofs of tile. The remaining 49,440 houses accommodating 218,316 persons or 90\u00b768 per cent, with a population per house of 4\u00b742 souls, included all buildings with thatch or leaves or whose outer walls were of mud.\n\nThe village establishment generally includes the village headman, patel; the village accountant, tal\u00e1di; the watchmen, r\u00e1vani\u00e1s; and the messenger, hav\u00e1ld\u00e1r. The artisans, who are paid by the villagers in kind, live in towns and large villages. Most of the village headmen are Kolis, Bhils, and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s. The rest are generally Kanbis, Rajputs, Pateliy\u00e1s, or Lub\u00e1n\u00e1s. The watchmen, r\u00e1vani\u00e1s, are chiefly Bhils and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s. The headmen are held in much respect. At all village religious ceremonies and on betrothal, marriage, and death celebrations, their presence is desired and they are given places of special honour.\n\nAt the time of transfer (1853) the district was in great want of people. Some account is given below of the efforts from time to time made by Government and the officers in charge of the district to draw settlers from the crowded parts of central Gujar\u00e1t. The great increase in the population shows that to some extent these efforts have succeeded. But up to 1877 all attempts to colonize on a large scale failed. In that year a movement took place among some of the lower class cultivators of central Gujar\u00e1t of special interest, not only because it was spontaneous and widespread, but because in spite of very great difficulty both in the character of the settlers and of their first seasons in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, it has to some extent\n\n\u00b9 In different parts of the Dohad sub-division extensive foundations mark the sites of many large villages destroyed according to the local belief by shocks of earthquake. Dohad Survey Report, 1877.\nproved a success. In March 1877 the H\u00e1lo\u00ed police reported\\(^1\\) that over a thousand Tal\u00e1vi\u00e1s, a low class tribe of central Gujar\u00e1t apparently the same as the Surat Dubl\u00e1s, were encamped close to mount P\u00e1v\u00e1gad. They had with them their wives, children, cattle, and some store of grain, and said they were come to settle. After the first detachment hundreds of families kept pouring in, each with a cart or rough bullock sledge piled high with grindstones, bunches of fowls, clothes, cooking pots, and children. Behind came the father of the family loaded, and then the mother and elder children also carrying burdens and driving before them their small stock of goats and cows. Their answers were always the same. Who are you?\u2014Tal\u00e1vi\u00e1s. Where are you going?\u2014To M\u00e1ta. What for?\u2014To cultivate. Where have you come from?\u2014There; with a long drawl and backward wave of the hand. Why did you leave?\u2014There was no land, the people with money turned us out of our fields. A few more questions, and they would give the name of the district and village they came from, ending with the refrain \u2018many more of us are on the way.\u2019 On reaching P\u00e1v\u00e1gad the first care of each family was to worship at the hill-top shrine of the M\u00e1ta or mother. For days, in an almost unbroken stream, the worshippers kept passing up and down, returning with their brows smeared with the red mark of the goddess. Camps were formed each with its headman or patel; the people from the different districts choosing to camp by themselves. When their camp was fixed, each family raised a rough hut and cattle shed and buried their supplies of grain in the ground. Some of the old wells, relics of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner\u2019s greatness, were cleared out and yielded good water. This movement was due to a religious teacher or guru who had been ordered by the goddess K\u00e1lka M\u00e1ta and a Musalm\u00e1n saint to tell the people that if they went back to their old Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner home they would find riches and plenty; if they refused to go they would die. As a token of her favour the goddess promised on the night of the March full moon to set fire to their offering of butter and rice and to send a Br\u00e1hman to tell them what they should do. On the 22nd, the night of the full moon, 7000 of the Tal\u00e1vi\u00e1s went up the hill, each carrying something to swell the general offering. All made ready and duly laid before the \u2018Mother,\u2019 the worshippers waited watching till dawn to see their offering take fire. But no fire came, no Br\u00e1hman and no voice from the goddess. At last tired out they set fire to their offering and left convinced that the work had not the mother\u2019s favour. Most of them went back to their old homes. Of 1367 families only 685 with ten carts, fifty-seven ploughs, 133 bullocks, and about 250 cows and goats remained. Except a few who chose sites a couple of miles off, they settled close to P\u00e1v\u00e1gad, forming twelve hamlets, the houses built in square groups, not each by itself like those of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls Bhils and Naikd\u00e1s. During the hot weather months they earned a living chiefly by selling firewood in the villages near, and by some Government aid in the shape of roadmaking and pond clearing. With this and the help of money advances, they were able before the rainy season to finish their houses, to buy\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Contributed by W. B. Prescott, Esq., District Superintendent of Police.\nabout 900 head of cattle, and to sow about 798 acres (1359 bigh\u00e1s) of land. But the failure of the rains (June-October 1877) pressed them hard. Many went to their old homes. The rest, without skill or habits of steady work, seem by degrees to be falling back to their former position of labourers. As a colony the movement has not been a great success. But it is not without good results. An area of 675 acres (1150 bigh\u00e1s) has been cleared for cultivation and may tempt settlers from among the Kanbis, Bohor\u00e1s, and other high class Gujar\u00e1t peasants of whose skilled and prudent labour the Panch Mah\u00e1ls stand in much need. Another class of recent settlers are low caste M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis, who leaving M\u00e1rv\u00e1d during the famine of 1869, have fixed their homes in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. Chiefly day labourers, most of them are to be found in the east of the district. Besides these permanent settlers, road-making and other public works attract labour. The workers, chiefly Dheds from Kaira and from M\u00e1rv\u00e1d, stay during the hot and cold seasons and go away in the rains.\n\nOf the people of the district three classes leave their villages in search of a living. A few Musalm\u00e1ns seek military service in native states, Br\u00e1hmans, leaving their families behind, go long begging tours remaining away two or three years at a time, and among the labouring classes Bhils at the beginning of March find work in collecting poppy juice in the M\u00e1lwa opium fields.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nAgriculture supports 173,819 persons or 72:20 per cent of the entire population.\u00b9\n\nWithin the limits of the district are great varieties of soil. In the north-west of Godhra near the Mahi is some alluvial, bh\u00e1tha, land, south of this a belt of dull black, m\u00e1l, such as is found in Th\u00e1sra, and beyond that a very large tract of light, gor\u00e1du, land. To the north and north-east of Godhra a rich medium black, besar, bears heavy crops of wheat and gram. K\u00e1lol except a few villages of dark clayey medium black, besar, well suited to rice, kodra, and other coarser grains, is throughout light, gor\u00e1du. In the south of H\u00e1lo are stretches of rich but badly tilled black soil. Except stony hill-ridges and patches of shallow gritty red and dry black, the soil of the eastern division, both light and black, is, perhaps from the abundance of water, of very high quality. The light, varying in shade from fawn to reddish brown yields two, and if watered, three crops a year.\n\nThe Government or kh\u00e1lsa villages of the district contain 514,052 acres, of which 56,589 acres or 11 per cent are alienated, paying only a quitrent, and 33,805 acres or 6:57 per cent are unarable waste. The total area of Government arable land is therefore 423,658 acres, of which 151,194 acres or 35:68 per cent are occupied, and 272,464 or 64:31 per cent are unoccupied. Of these 272,464 acres of unoccupied arable land, 23,418 acres including grazing lands, forests, and homesteads cannot be taken up for cultivation. The whole available area of unoccupied arable land is therefore reduced to 249,046 acres. Of the occupied area 3064 acres or 2:02 per cent are garden land, 8447 or 5:58 per cent unwatered rice land, and 139,683 or 92:38 per cent dry crop land.\n\nFields are watered from rivers, ponds, and wells. From rivers the water is drawn by means of rough wooden lever-lifts, dhekudis,\n\n\u00b9 This total (173,819) is made up of the following items:\n(1) Adult males engaged in agriculture as per census of 1872........... 54,566\n(2) Wives of ditto calculated on the basis of the proportion the total adult female population of the district bears to the total adult male population .................................................. 49,229\n(3) Children of 1 and 2 calculated on a similar basis ...................... 70,024\n\nTotal ... 173,819\n\nThis calculation is necessary, because the census returns including many of the women under VII. (Miscellaneous) show a total of only 473 under the special head adult agricultural females.\ncosting only a few shillings (Rs. 3-4) to set up. Except at the Malav reservoir where are gravitation gates, the system of watering from ponds is the same as from rivers. As springs are found close to the surface, wells have not to be sunk more than from fifteen to thirty feet. A built, palka, well with water enough for a single leather bag costs to make from \u00a320 to \u00a330 (Rs. 200-Rs. 300).\n\nA plough of land varies greatly according to circumstances. When the pay of village headmen was reckoned in land a plough was generally taken at about 11\u00bd acres, 20 bigh\u00e1s, supposed to be the largest area of medium soil that a pair of strong Charotar bullocks could properly plough. Under these conditions of soil and ploughing Kanbis with specially fine cattle are said to till fifteen acres; Vanj\u00e1ras with well-fed local p\u00e1l, cattle seven acres, and Kolis with badly kept cattle five acres. But in most places as the soil is scratched and not ploughed a pair of bullocks can run over a much larger area. In the two assessed sub-divisions the survey returns shew for each pair of bullocks, in K\u00e1lol an average area of 10\u00be acres and in Godhra of 13\u00be.\n\nIn Godhra and K\u00e1lol, the settled parts of the district, the total tilled area is parcelled into 13,443 holdings, kh\u00e1t\u00e1s. These farms of which the largest is 116\u00be acres, and the smallest one acre, contain on an average 10\u00bd acres. It is believed that with a five-acre farm a husbandman, though scrimped, will not want for food or clothing; that a seven-acre light soil farm, even though unwatered, will keep him in fair comfort, and that from a ten-acre light soil farm he will, if thrifty, be able to save. In 1876-77, including alienated lands, the total number of holdings was 25,308 with an average area of eight acres. Of the whole number, 13,373, or more than one-half were holdings of not more than five acres; 6355 of not more than ten acres; 3969 of not more than twenty acres; 1451 of not more than fifty acres; 110 of not more than 100 acres, and fifty above 100 acres. Most of the holdings of 100 acres and upwards are in the hands of the class of superior landlords known as talukd\u00e1rs.\n\nDuring the twenty years ending 1877 ploughs have increased from 18,303 to 37,141 or 102\u00b792 per cent; carts from 6129 to 8349 or 36\u00b722 per cent; and live-stock from 173,859 to 254,262 or 46\u00b724 per cent.\n\n| Year       | Ploughs | Carts | Oxen | Cows | Buffaloes | Horses | Sheep and Goats | Camels | Asses. | Total |\n|------------|---------|-------|------|------|-----------|--------|-----------------|--------|-------|-------|\n| 1856-57    | 16,303  | 6129  | 55,088 | 70,255 | 28,651 | 1609 | 17,096 | 42 | 938 | 173,859 |\n| 1876-77    | 37,141  | 8349  | 86,024 | 90,928 | 37,672 | 3488 | 34,030 | 419 | 1701 | 254,262 |\n| Increase per cent in 1876-77 | 102\u00b792 | 36\u00b722 | 56\u00b721 | 29\u00b742 | 31\u00b748 | 92\u00b705 | 99\u00b705 | 697\u00b762 | 31\u00b734 | 46\u00b724 |\n\nIn the villages inhabited by the better class of cultivators, Kanbis, Talabda Kolis, Pateliy\u00e1s, and Gh\u00e1nchis, light soils are manured.\nploughed twice or thrice, sown through a drill, and a fortnight after cleaned with a weeder, karab, and smoothed by a log of wood, samar. In other parts of the district, the system of husbandry is of the roughest and most primitive kind. Though they do not use dung for fuel the people seldom manure their lands; fallows are kept only to a small extent, and land is seldom watered. Few of the Dohad Bhils have any field tools except one plough and even this many have to borrow. They merely run the plough once lightly through the surface of the field and immediately afterwards sow the seed. They show neither care nor thrift and leave all to nature. In the N\u00e1rukot state many of the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s sow their grain among wood ashes. Of this practice there are two forms, one locally called bantio consists of burning down a tract of brushwood and without any tillage sowing seed among the ashes; the other called v\u00e1lra is to cut down branches and brushwood and heaping them in one place to set fire to them and sow after loosening the surface with a pickaxe. Bambi, Eleusine coracana, growing during the rains, is almost the only grain raised by N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s.\n\nOf 151,194 acres the total area of occupied land 40,152 acres or 26\u00b765 per cent were in the year 1877-78 fallow or under grass. Of the 111,042 acres\u00b9 under cultivation grain crops occupied 94,478 acres or 84\u00b79 per cent, 36,629 of them under maize, mak\u00e1i, Zea mays; 20,022 under b\u00e1jri, Penicillaria spicata; 15,052 under rice, d\u00e1ngr, Oryza sativa; 9566 under n\u00e1gli, Eleusine corocana; 6771 under kodra, Paspalum scrobiculatum; 2964 under juv\u00e1r, Sorghum vulgare; 513 under wheat, gha\u00fa, Triticum aestivum; 314 under chenna, Panicum miliaceum; 138 under barley, jav, Hordeum hexastichon; and 2509 under other cereals of which details are not available. Pulses occupied 27,752 acres or 24\u00b79 per cent, 19,967 of them under gram, chana, Cicer arietinum; 2607 under adad, Phaseolus mungo; 1935 under mag, Phaseolus radiatus; 1440 under tuver, Cajanus indicus; 312 under peas, vat\u00e1na, Pisum sativum, and 1491 under other pulses. Oil seeds occupied 4519 acres or 4\u00b706 per cent, 3725 of them under gingelly oilseed, tal, Sesamum indicum; 40 under rape seed, sarsav, Brassica napus; and 754 under mustard, r\u00e1i, Sinapis racemosa, and other oilseeds. Fibres occupied 929 acres, 897 of them under Bombay hemp, san, Crotalaria juncea, and 32 under cotton, kap\u00e1s, Gossypium herbaceum. Miscellaneous crops occupied 530 acres, 143 of them under sugarcane, serid\u00ed, Saccharum officinarum; 34 under tobacco, tamb\u00e1ku, Nicotiana tabacum; 4 under poppy, khaskhas, Papaver somniferum; and 349 under miscellaneous vegetables and fruits.\n\nAmong the district crops Maize, mak\u00e1i, Zea mays, the staple food of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls people holds the first place, with, in 1877-78, 36,629 acres or 32\u00b798 per cent of the whole tillage area. Maize is one of the chief products of the Dohad sub-division forming, in the rich lands that yield twice a year, the rainy season or early crop sown in June and reaped in September in time to make the ground ready for a cold season crop of wheat or gram.\n\n\u00b9 Of 111,042 acres 17,166 were twice cropped.\nMillet, bajri, Pennicillaria spicata, holds the second place, with 20,022 acres or 18.03 per cent. It is cultivated chiefly in the western sub-divisions of Godhra and K\u00e1lol.\n\nRice, d\u00e1ngr, Oryza sativa, holds the third place, with 15,052 acres or 13.55 per cent. It is cultivated in all the sub-divisions. Very little is watered and none but s\u00e1thi, sutars\u00e1l, and other inferior and coarse kinds are grown. In embanked fields the seed is sown in a nursery and the plants put out. In open fields the seed is sown broadcast, a lazy careless tillage adopted by low class cultivators. Embanked fields yield rice year after year. But no second crop is ever raised from them. N\u00e1gli, Eleusine coracana, kodra, Paspalum scrobiculatum, and jiw\u00e1r, Sorghum vulgare, are grown in the western sub-divisions. The ordinary Koli tillage of these grains is unskilled and unthrifty. The ground is scraped once with the plough and after sowing is left unweeded and uncared for till harvest time, and then left waste generally for two or three years. Before the introduction of the revenue survey, fields paid rent only when cropped. But now with a lower rate levied every year, some change in the system of tillage will probably be required.\n\nWheat, ghan, Triticum aestivum, with, in 1876-77, 8553 acres is in the eastern division a leading and increasing product. Five varieties are grown, d\u00e1udkh\u00e1n\u00ed white brown very clear and full; k\u00e1tha m\u00e1lvi, not so full as d\u00e1udkh\u00e1n\u00ed, with a mixture of inferior reddish wheat; k\u00e1tha d\u00e1udi, thin hard and not full, a mixture of white brown and reddish grain; v\u00f3jia the worst kind, dull brown with very small but soft grain, and gomadia, a low class d\u00e1udkh\u00e1n\u00ed, of dull white brown with thin and shrivelled grain. Wheat is grown in stiff black loam and to a less extent in medium black, besar, soil. It is usually sown as a second crop following rice or maize. The sowing is in November and December. Before sowing the land is ploughed, and when levelled by the clod crusher, the seed is sown at the rate of from forty to eighty pounds the acre in drills about one foot apart. Manure is seldom used. Panch Mah\u00e1l's wheat is sent to central and western Gujar\u00e1t, Baroda, and the surrounding native states.\n\nSugarcane, serdi, Saccharum officinarum, is grown in small quantities in Godhra and K\u00e1lol. It is neither so rich in juice nor of so high a quality as Kaira sugarcane. Quantities of molasses were at one time exported. But prices fell and as the former Government refused to reduce the rates of assessment the culture of sugarcane ceased. After the transfer its cultivation again spread, favoured by a local custom of allowing the hereditary officers, des\u00e1is and patels, 6\u00bd per cent of the revenue derived from sugarcane. In 1864 on the ground that it might lead the officers in question to force sugarcane cultivation, this grant was stopped, and since then sugarcane has again declined.\n\nThe Poppy, khaskhas, Papaver somniferum, used to a small extent to be grown in Dohad and Jh\u00e1lod by M\u00e1lis, Bhils, and Kanbis. A\n\n---\n\n1 Major Wallace 71, 12th September 1856,\n2 Gov. Res. 2728, 19th July 1864.\ncold weather crop wanting good soil and much water, it was chiefly grown along the banks of streams many of which used to be gay with belts of its white or white and red flowers. In growing the poppy a field of black soil, from which during the rainy season maize or hemp had been reaped, was generally chosen. Soon after div\u00e1li, November-December, the land was four or five times ploughed, divided into squares, manured, and sown with poppy seed, khaskhas. After sowing, the field was for three months watered once a fortnight. The plant was then full grown, watering was stopped, and after a fortnight the outer skin of the flower capsule was slit and next morning the juice that had oozed out was scraped with a knife into a brass pot. The slitting and juice-gathering, a slow and hard task, were thrice repeated. After gathering it, the juice was mixed with oil at the rate of a quarter of a pound of oil to one pound of juice. In this state it was kept by the grower till it hardened and was then sold in the market. The buyers, rolling it into balls, sold some of it locally and sent the rest to Baroda and Bombay. The poppy was never a favourite crop. The law (Act I. of 1878) forbidding its growth has caused little hardship.\n\nOf Pulses, Gram, chana, Cicer arietinum, a favourite second or cold weather crop in the well watered Dohad valleys, is exported in considerable quantities.\n\nOf Oil Seeds, tal, Sesamum indicum, is largely grown, the area 10,044 acres in 1876-77 being greater than in Kaira. Large quantities of oil are extracted and exported to M\u00e1lwa and to central and western Gujar\u00e1t. Oil pressed from doli or mahuda seed is sent in considerable quantities to Kapadvanj and there used in the manufacture of soap.\n\nBombay Hemp, san, Crotalaria juncea, with in 1877-78 an area of 897 acres, is by all classes of husbandmen grown both in black and light, but chiefly in black soil. It is a rainy season, kharif, crop sown on the first fall of rain. At the end of three months the seed ripens and the heads are cut off. Then the plants are cut, tied in bundles, and for a week or so left to rot in some pond or river. When they are taken out the fibres are separated and made into coils. Some of it is used locally, either woven by Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s into pack saddles or by cultivators made into ropes. Most of the rest goes to Bombay.\n\nBesides chillies, onions, and other garden produce raised in river-bank fields, Potatoes, bat\u00e1ta, have of late years been very successfully grown.\n\nKolis, Bhils, and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s form the bulk of the agricultural population. Of the higher classes of cultivators the few Kanbis are skilful and thrifty, and in most parts of the district there are local, talabda, Kolis, M\u00e1lis, and Rajputs below Kanbis in knowledge but still a valuable peasantry. In Dohad are Pateliy\u00e1s, Lub\u00e1n\u00e1s, and R\u00e1val\u00eds, all superior to the lazy and unthrifty melv\u00e1s Koli and Bhil. Some Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s and Musalm\u00e1ns of the Gh\u00e1nchi class, thrown out of their former occupation of carrying have taken to tillage. As yet they have met with little success.\nThe crops occasionally suffer from mildew and insects. In 1845 most of the maize was eaten by locusts. Except a few villages on the Mahi the district is free from damage by floods. But the rainfall is uncertain and during the last twenty years the failure of crops from want of rain has on six occasions caused scarcity and distress. In 1853 no rain fell after July and all the chief crops failed. In 1856 the western sub-divisions suffered seriously from the complete failure of the latter rain. In 1857 the rains were very late of beginning, causing loss of crops in the eastern division. In 1861 and again in 1864 the rainfall was irregular and scanty. Finally in 1877 there were only 19\u00b710 inches, less than half of the average rain supply. The crops failed and sickness and want were so widespread that towards the close of the season (April-June) special relief measures were found necessary.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCAPITAL.\n\nAccording to the 1872 census returns there were in that year, besides well-to-do cultivators and professional men, 1697 persons in positions implying the possession of capital. Of these 423 were bankers, money changers, and shopkeepers, and 1274 were merchants and traders. Under the 1869-70 income-tax returns 450 persons paid on yearly incomes of from \u00a350 to \u00a3100 (Rs. 500 - Rs. 1000); and in 1872-73, 101 persons paid on incomes of from \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 1000 - Rs. 2000) and fifteen on incomes of from \u00a3200 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 2000 - Rs. 10,000). Unlike other Gujarat districts the Panch Mahals are so poor and backward that there is little capital and few savings pressing for investment. Only by Government servants are Government securities bought or money laid up in savings banks. Except the holding of a poor debtor with no other property, land is seldom bought, the yearly return being only from 2\u00bd to 3 per cent instead of the 20 or 30 per cent the money might yield if lent at interest.\n\nThe local money-lenders are Vani\u00e1s, Br\u00e1hmans, and Bohor\u00e1s. Seven or eight of them are men of wealth, bankers who give bills, hundis, on Baroda, Bombay, Indor, and Ratl\u00e1m. Of village money-lenders Vani\u00e1s are the chief, though well-to-do Kanbis also lend money and advance grain. A few of these Kanbis who are rich are thought more liberal creditors than the Vani\u00e1s. Of the whole body of money-lenders about ten per cent are supposed to deal with townspeople only; about sixty per cent with Kolis, Bhils, and the poorer class of cultivators, and about thirty per cent both with the poor and the well-to-do.\n\nBankers, p\u00e1rakh\u015b, keep the following account books, the cash book, rojmel; the ledger, kh\u00e1t\u00e1vahi; the monthly account book, \u00e1varo, and the interest book, vy\u00e1jvahi. Those who deal with Kolis and low class borrowers keep an account current book, th\u00e1mkh\u00e1ta. Those who are shopkeepers as well as money-lenders keep in addition to the first four books an account current book, th\u00e1mkh\u00e1ta. In this are entered the amounts advanced, the sums recovered and the articles sold sometimes with, sometimes without their value. The register book, nondh, generally kept by petty grain, spice, and cloth dealers is in memorandum form. As a rule it has only the debit, udh\u00e1r, side, receipts being entered below the articles sold or the sums advanced. Debts are paid in grain or cattle, seldom in money. Creditors almost never write off claims as bad debts. However faint the chance of payment\nthe account is kept open and the bond renewed every third year in the hope that a day may come when the debtor will be able to pay. The amount of grain advanced either for seed or food depends on the borrower's position. It seldom goes beyond 480 pounds, one mani, for seed, and 1440 pounds, three manis, for food. The grain is after six months repaid in kind sometimes a quarter, but generally half as much again as the original amount advanced.\n\nIn a district so poor and so entirely agricultural the borrowers are chiefly cultivators most of them belonging to the unsettled classes, low Kolis, Bhils, and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s. As a rule most careless and ill informed, they seldom know how the debt began, when and what they have paid, or how much is still due. Most of the poorer class of cultivators are almost entirely dependent on the money-lender. The greater part of their crops when ripe goes to pay off their debts. Left with too small a store of grain to last them throughout the year they are from time to time forced to borrow. As a rule borrowers deal with only one money-lender. When they borrow from more than one the creditor who has advanced money to pay their rent, or has advanced grain for seed or food has the preference and is considered to have the right to attach the crop. When a civil action is brought against a Koli or a man of the other poorer classes he generally admits the claim. The debtor's property is seldom sold except when he is thought to be likely to dispose of it privately. When, in consequence of a civil court decree, immovable property is sold it is generally bought by the creditor at a nominal price. Though still so poor and backward these tribes have made some advance under British management, seldom having recourse to the robbery and murder so common under the former Government.\n\nIn the case of Bhils, the civil courts do not enforce a higher rate of interest than six per cent. Practically this limit has little effect, the actual rates being indefinitely increased by a system of premiums. N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s and other unsettled tribes have no credit beyond an advance on the security of their crops. Interest is charged by the lunar month at rates corresponding to yearly rates of from nine to twelve per cent to an artisan with good credit; twelve per cent to a cultivator in middling circumstances, and from twelve to fifteen per cent to a poor cultivator. On a debt unpaid at the end of the year compound interest at the rate of twenty-five per cent on capital and interest is charged. In opening accounts with petty traders and artisans the banker makes besides interest two or three per cent profit as premium.\n\nAt the time of their transfer, the Panch Mah\u00e1ls had a local currency both of silver and copper coins made in the Dohad mint. Besides the regular mint-profits it was then the practice to farm the right of calling in and changing the copper currency twice a year. Except putting a fresh mark to it nothing was done to the coin. But the fees charged for stamping yielded a yearly revenue of about \u00a3110 (Rs. 1100).\u00b9 In 1861 owing to the expected introduction of British copper coins the value of the local pieces became greatly depreciated\n\n\u00b9 Major Buckle 606, 7th November 1861.\nand their coinage was stopped. The Dohad rupee ceased to be legal tender in 1858 and soon after disappeared. The Baroda, b\u0101b\u0101sh\u0101h, rupee was then the only coin in use and only by degrees was the British rupee raised to be the standard. In 1861 all contracts for spirits and drugs, and in the year following the land revenue, were declared payable in Imperial rupees with the provision that for three years the Baroda coin would be taken at the assay rate of exchange. Still the use of the British coin is almost entirely confined to the payment of Imperial dues, the Baroda rupee being the ordinary medium in private dealings. The intrinsic and legal value of the Baroda rupee is about fourteen per cent below that of the Imperial coin. But from its worn and injured state its trade value is from eighteen to twenty-two per cent less than the Imperial rupee. Its value varies considerably at different times of the year. It is unusually depressed when Imperial rupees are in demand for the payment of rents and abnormally high at the harvest time, M\u0101h (February) and Vaish\u0101kh (May). Counterfeit Baroda coins are common and at the time of exchange each is carefully tested by a V\u0101nia assayer, p\u0101rakh.\n\nExcept in the case of service holdings the practice of mortgaging land is not common. According to the registration returns mortgages in excess of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) have risen from 93 of the value of \u00a33479 (Rs. 34,790) in 1869-70, to 151 of the value of \u00a36074 (Rs. 60,740) in 1876-77.\n\nCarpenters and bricklayers are found in towns and large villages. Not always employed, their daily wages are high, varying from 1s. to 1s. 3d. (8-10 annas) and as a class they are well-to-do. The wages of ordinary day labourers are (1878) for a man from 3\u00bdd. to 5\u00bdd. (2\u00bd-3\u00bd annas); for a woman from 2\u00bdd. to 3d. (1\u00bd-2 annas), and for a boy or girl from 1d. to 1\u00bdd. (\u00bd-1 anna). Twenty-five years ago the daily wage of unskilled labour was for a man 3\u00bdd. (2\u00bd annas); for a woman 3d. (2 annas), and for a boy or girl 2\u00bdd. (1\u00bd annas). Except by cultivators who pay either wholly or partly in kind these wages are paid daily in cash. The labouring classes are M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis, Kolis, and Bhils. Musalm\u00e1ns also of the Gh\u00e1nchis class, carriers by trade, in the rainy months when traffic is at a standstill, go in bands to the fields to work. These Gh\u00e1nchis are not properly labourers being a superior class, many of them well-to-do and almost all with good personal credit. Except for field work the only regular day labourers are M\u00e1rv\u00e1dis, a frugal and hardworking set of men. In the fair season large public works attract Dheds and other labourers from central Gujar\u00e1t. Bhils and Kolis work in the fields but they dislike and are unsuited to steady hard labour and are seldom employed in road making or other large undertakings. The actual work of cultivation does not give rise to any great demand for labour. The few rich cultivators employ workmen during the whole rains. But as a rule except at harvest time there is no general demand. The greater part of the work done by Bhils, N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s, and other unsettled tribes is forest work; in the cold season, grass and firewood-cutting and in the hot months, timber-felling and mahuda-gathering. Among the\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Res. 1485, 14th April 1862.\nlabouring classes women do as much work as men. The greater part of the unskilled labour in public works is generally done by women. During the last ten years the demand for and the wages of unskilled labour have considerably declined, and though at the same time the price of food and clothes has fallen, the state of the labouring classes is probably on the whole not so good as it was during the prosperous years of the American war. The Ghanchis, Marvadis, and Dheds are a thrifty and frugal people, saving money when they find good employment. But the Bhils and Naskdas lay by nothing, spending as they make in liquor and other personal indulgence. Mortgage of labour is unknown in the Panch Mahals. In some Musalm\u00e1n houses in Godhra and Dohad the descendants of household slaves still hold a position of dependence, choosing though in no way forced to do so to work for the family who formerly owned them.\n\nField produce prices are available only for the sixteen years ending 1878. During these years rice has varied from ten pounds for 2s. (Re. 1) in 1865 to thirty in 1873 and averaged nineteen pounds; wheat has varied from eleven pounds in 1865 to twenty-eight in 1876 and averaged eighteen pounds; millet, bajri, has varied from sixteen pounds in 1864 to fifty-four in 1875 and averaged thirty pounds; gram has varied from sixteen pounds in 1865 to fifty-eight pounds in 1876 and averaged thirty-one pounds; pulse, dal, has varied from nine pounds in 1865 to thirty-eight pounds in 1876 and averaged eighteen pounds; and maize has varied from twenty-one pounds in 1865 to fifty-nine in 1876 and averaged thirty-nine. This period began with a most marked rise. In 1864 and 1865 prices stood very high; then during the next seven years (1866-1872) came a constant though moderate fall, followed by four years (1873-1876) of cheap but steady rates, ending by a moderate rise in 1877 and by extremely high prices in 1878. The following statement shows for the chief grains the price in pounds for two shillings during the sixteen years ending 1878:\n\n| Product       | Year |\n|---------------|------|\n| Rice, common  | 1863 | 22 |\n|               | 1864 | 12 |\n|               | 1865 | 10 |\n|               | 1866 | 15 |\n|               | 1867 | 16 |\n|               | 1868 | 15 |\n|               | 1869 | 18 |\n|               | 1870 | 16 |\n|               | 1871 | 17 |\n|               | 1872 | 30 |\n|               | 1873 | 30 |\n|               | 1874 | 30 |\n|               | 1875 | 30 |\n|               | 1876 | 26 |\n|               | 1877 | 12 |\n| Wheat         |      |    |\n| Millet, bajri |      |    |\n| Gram          |      |    |\n| Pulse, tuver dal |   |    |\n| Maize         |      |    |\n\nThe details of weights and measures given at page 65 of the Kaira Statistical Account apply to the Panch Mahals.\n\n1 The figures for the ten years ending 1872, taken from the Godhra survey report, refer to that sub-division only; those for the six years ending 1878, taken from the yearly administration reports, represent the average prices of the district.\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTRADE.\u00b9\n\nDuring the last twelve years (1867-1878) by the help of cheap stone metal, and liberal public works grants, aided by local funds, tolls, special funds, and duties, much has been done towards supplying the main lines of traffic with well made roads. The most important trade route lies east and west, connecting Gujar\u00e1t with Central India and Rajput\u00e1na. This line formerly ended westwards in Baroda, but since the opening in 1874 of the branch railway to P\u00e1li, traffic has been turned to that station. Beginning at P\u00e1li, bridged but so far only partially metalled, the road runs east sixteen miles to Godhra; from Godhra, metalled and except the P\u00e1nam river bridged throughout, with an eight mile branch to the town of B\u00e1riya, it runs east to Dohad forty-four miles, twenty-one of them in B\u00e1riya territory. Besides this main line there is in the western division a banked and bridged but unmetalled road from Godhra south-west twenty-one miles through K\u00e1lol to Kh\u00e1khar\u00eda on the Baroda boundary. In the south a branch twenty-five miles long begins near K\u00e1lol and runs by H\u00e1lol to J\u00e1mbughoda. This is a fair weather track and there are similar lines from Godhra fourteen miles north by Sehera to the Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da boundary. There is also from Kantdi a branch fifteen miles north-east to join the Godhra and Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da road, used chiefly by traffic between P\u00e1li and Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth. Another cleared track runs north thirty miles, twenty of them in British territory from S\u00e1lia, twelve miles from Godhra, on the Godhra and Dohad road to Sunth. An unimproved track runs from Godhra north-east to Limdi and Jh\u00e1lod. This formerly carried a large traffic, but since the Godhra and Dohad road has been finished it has almost ceased to be used. In the eastern division a bridged and metalled road is under construction from Jh\u00e1lod by Limdi to the B\u00e1riya boundary fourteen miles, and this is being continued eleven miles further in B\u00e1riya to join the Godhra and Dohad road east of the Harap river. The distance from Godhra to Jh\u00e1lod along this route is fifty miles. A partially improved track also runs south from Limdi to Dohad fourteen miles, the total from Jh\u00e1lod to Dohad being twenty miles. These, stretching over a total distance of 170 miles, are the only made or partially made roads and they include all the chief traffic routes. Other less important lines are provided with rough cart tracks.\n\nThe chief bridge is across the Karad river near K\u00e1lol on the Godhra and Kh\u00e1khar\u00eda road. It has three seventy-six feet openings\n\n\u00b9 The trade section is contributed by T. D. Little, Esquire, Executive Engineer Panch Mah\u00e1s.\nspanned by wrought iron girders carried on stone masonry piers. On the Godhra and Dohad road over the Ghod\u00e1kh\u00e1l river near Dohad is a bridge with three fifty feet arches, and there are many other small bridges. The P\u00e1nam river on the Godhra and Dohad road eleven miles east of Godhra is crossed by a low level or Irish bridge of concrete.\n\nThere are no buildings for the accommodation of district officers. Of rest-houses, dharmsh\u00e1l\u00e1s, suited for native travellers there are in all twenty-three. Of these ten are situated in the Godhra sub-division, seven in K\u00e1lol, and six in Dohad. Of those in Godhra seven are at the town of Godhra; one at the village of Sehera on the high road from Godhra to Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da; one at Tua on the high road from Godhra to P\u00e1li; and one at Urv\u00e1da on the high road from Godhra to Dohad. Of the K\u00e1lol rest-houses, one is at K\u00e1lol, three at H\u00e1lo\u0142, one within the town and two on the road from K\u00e1lol to J\u00e1mbughoda, and one at each of the three villages of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, Mal\u00e1v and Kanjri. Of the Dohad rest-houses, three are at Dobad, one outside the town near the lake, and two on the high road from Godhra to Dohad, two are at Jh\u00e1lod, and one at Garh\u00e1ru. Besides these the district is provided with a traveller's bungalow at K\u00e1lol on the road from Godhra to Baroda. This last is the only building suited for European travellers.\n\nThere are no permanent ferries in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. During the rainy season a boat plies between Gotra and P\u00e1li on the Mahi. It is maintained from the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and Kaira local funds, the proceeds being divided equally between the two districts. The total yield of this temporary ferry amounted in 1875-76 to \u00a324 (Rs. 240).\n\nFor postal purposes the Panch Mah\u00e1ls form part of the Gujar\u00e1t postal division. They contain six post offices at Godhra, K\u00e1lol, H\u00e1lo\u0142, J\u00e1mbughoda, Dohad, and Jh\u00e1lod. These offices are supervised by the inspector of post offices in the Gujar\u00e1t division, helped by the sub-inspector of the Kaira district. Except J\u00e1mbughoda with a clerk on \u00a36 (Rs. 60) a year the officials in charge of these offices are styled deputy postmasters with yearly salaries varying from \u00a324 to \u00a348 (Rs. 240-Rs. 480) and averaging \u00a336 (Rs. 360). Payments in connection with these offices are made from the disbursing post office at Baroda. There are six postmen on \u00a39 12s. (Rs. 96) and five rural messengers on \u00a312 (Rs. 120) a year.\n\nThe district has no Government telegraph office.\n\nAt the time of the transfer of the district (1855) there were two branches of trade, one local, the other a through traffic between the coast and Gujar\u00e1t on the west and M\u00e1lwa and Central India in the east. The trading season lasted from October to June. Almost the whole traffic in both its branches was in the hands of professional carriers, wagoners belonging to the class of Musalm\u00e1n Gh\u00e1\u0144ch\u00eds and pack bullock owners, most of them Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s or Ch\u00e1rans. The bullock owners went in great troops divided into bands, each with its leader, n\u00e1ik. The wagoners, most of them armed with swords and shields, forming large caravans joined purses to hire Bhils as advance\nand rear guards. At night they drew their wagons into a circle, the cattle in the middle, each ox connected with its yokefellow and the wagon by an iron chain fastened to the cart wheel. Each wagon carried about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ tons and was drawn by three or four pairs of bullocks. They charged a ton mileage rate of from 9d. to 1s. (6-8 annas). Of the through trade, the imports from Gujar\u00e1t were tobacco, salt, cocoanuts, and spices; and from M\u00e1lwa, opium, wheat, red dye, and M\u00e1lwa cloth. Of the local trade the imports from Gujar\u00e1t were, besides those sent to M\u00e1lwa, hardware and piecgoods; the exports were honey, molasses, timber, mahuda berries, and gums from Godhra, K\u00e1lol, and the neighbouring states, chiefly westwards to Gujar\u00e1t; and gram, oil, and maize from Dohad, chiefly eastwards to M\u00e1lwa and Mew\u00e1r. Both the through and the local traffic to M\u00e1lwa were larger than the trade west to Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nAt the time of transfer the district trade was stifled by the disordered state of the country, the want of roads, and the repeated levies of transit dues. Under British management order has been established, a bridged and metalled road runs through the whole breadth of the district, and transit dues have been simplified and to a great extent abolished. The result has been a marked increase of exports west to Gujar\u00e1t. At the same time the opening from Khandva of a line of railway into the heart of Central India has greatly interfered with the former through trade from the sea coast and Gujar\u00e1t to M\u00e1lwa and Central India.\n\nThe history of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls trade from the date of transfer up to 1867 is one of rapid development. Before the beginning of British management there were many routes from Gujar\u00e1t and the Gulf of Cambay to south Rajput\u00e1na and Central India. Of these one from Broach and Baroda went through Chhota Udepur and Ali R\u00e1jpur; a second from Cambay touched Nadi\u00e1d, Kapadvanj, and Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da, while others from Baroda, \u00c1nand, and Nadi\u00e1d passed through the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and B\u00e1riya. Formerly the Panch Mah\u00e1ls lines had a bad name. The roads were rough, transit dues were heavy, and the country was lawless and disorderly. Under British management, with the establishment of order and the reduction of transit dues, the Panch Mah\u00e1ls route grew so popular that in spite of reductions in rates, transit and toll revenues rose from \u00a33632 (Rs. 36,320) in 1858 to \u00a37819 (Rs. 78,190) in 1861. During these years the trade increase was greatly fostered by a great and general rise in prices, encouraging production and enlarging the area from which supplies could with profit be forwarded.\n\nUp to 1867 no trade details are available. The following table, from figures gathered in B\u00e1riya, shows for the ten years ending 1875-76, the approximate traffic between Gujar\u00e1t and the country east and north-east of B\u00e1riya, including the Dohad sub-division of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and the M\u00e1lwa and Mew\u00e1r territory beyond.\n\n---\n\n1 Bishop Heber's Narrative (1825) II. 109.  \n2 Col.

The great fall in the export of tobacco from 4000 tons in 1866-67 to 1800 tons in 1873-74 can at least partly be traced to the transfer of trade to the railway by Bombay and Khandva. This route though more than five times as long has besides cheap railway charges the advantage of freedom from transit dues. In 1875 by the abolition of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls transit dues trade taxation was much reduced. This and road improvements for a time drew back to the Panch Mah\u00e1ls route a larger amount of tobacco. But in the native states transit dues are still heavy,\u00b9 and as the railway has been continued from Khandva to Indor and Ujain the Panch Mah\u00e1ls route is not likely to regain its position.\n\nSalt though under the same conditions as tobacco shows less decline. The marked increase in 1875 is partly due to the fact that up to 1874 most of the salt was carried by pack bullocks and as the routes followed were often changed to avoid duties the returns are less complete than those for cart traffic. The minor items of export from Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t depend greatly on the season. They are chiefly for local use round the Dohad sub-division of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and include\n\n\u00b9 On one of the main Panch Mah\u00e1ls trade lines, within native limits, the tonnage charges amount to about 2d. (1\u00bd annas) a mile.\nvery little through trade. On the whole it may be said of the through trade from Gujar\u00e1t to M\u00e1lwa that the Panch Mah\u00e1ls route, though since 1867 much improved, has had to meet severe competition, and owing to the cheap railway carriage available on the other lines some of the trade has necessarily been lost, while heavy transit duties have prevented the opening of other outside markets to make up for the loss. But for the road and other improvements it is probable that instead of being reduced the through trade to M\u00e1lwa would have entirely ceased.\n\nAs regards the trade from M\u00e1lwa to Gujar\u00e1t the quantity received is small. The value was formerly large as it included a considerable supply of opium for consumption in Baroda and the Rewa K\u00e1ntha states and for illicit trade in British territory. This opium traffic has now been closed and the total value of the trade from M\u00e1lwa much reduced. The bulk of the M\u00e1lwa exports are food grains, wheat, gram, maize, and rice. These grain items amounting to as much as 70 per cent of the whole are, with the exception of a little M\u00e1lwa wheat, the produce of the eastern division of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and of the country round. Dohad has for many years been looked on as a granary and much of its surplus store always finds its way to M\u00e1lwa, Mew\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t. Originally the eastern markets had the preference as the transport charges including duties were lighter. But the branch line to P\u00e1li, the new Panch Mah\u00e1ls roads, and lowered transit dues have helped to draw Dohad grain west. At present it supplies either M\u00e1lwa, Mew\u00e1r, or Gujar\u00e1t according to price and demand. A bad season and high prices in either direction is sufficient to turn to it the bulk of the export. Under ordinary conditions Gujar\u00e1t is now preferred, for besides improved communications the M\u00e1lwa market is now to some extent supplied by the new Indor railway. The table shows a most marked variation in the grain export to Gujar\u00e1t. There were 5000 tons in 1866-67, 4000 tons each in 1870-71 and 1871-72, and in 1869-70 and again in 1874-75 less than 500 tons.\n\nOn the whole the returns seem to show that in spite of improvements, so long as heavy transit dues are levied in the states round the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, the trade from Gujar\u00e1t to M\u00e1lwa is not likely to increase. On the other hand though the two last years have been unfavourable, Dohad is almost certain to yield larger exports of grain.\n\nThe above table includes only the through traffic between Gujar\u00e1t and the country east of B\u00e1riya. The following table though for a shorter period is more complete including the two chief lines along which the bulk of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls traffic, both local and through, passes. The chief exports to Gujar\u00e1t are grain, mahuda berries, timber, and oil seeds; the chief imports from Gujar\u00e1t are tobacco, salt, cocoanuts, hardware, and piece goods.\n## Panch Mah\u0101ls

decline in some items of the through traffic the trade, as a whole shows a marked advance from 18,852 tons in 1873-74 to 21,363 in 1874-75, 25,486 in 1875-76, 34,427 in 1876-77, and 45,694 in 1877-78.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the new P\u00e1li railway branch, the opening of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls roads, and the removal of transit duties have had a powerful influence for good on the commercial prosperity of the district both in developing old branches of trade and in starting new ones. The effect is chiefly felt in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls itself and in those districts round where the benefits are not neutralized by excessive transit taxation.\n\nIn spite of the large total increase the returns show a marked decline in traffic along the Godhra and Baroda road. Fifteen years ago it was proposed to provide a good road for the Panch Mah\u00e1ls trade towards Baroda. But much of the distance is in native territory and as there were many difficulties the P\u00e1li line was adopted in its stead. The result has been not only a transfer of traffic from one route to the other but a large additional trade, the P\u00e1li road alone carrying much more than the whole united former trade.\n\nTimber is the chief article of export, the quantity varying during the last five years from 5472 tons in 1873 to 11,736 tons in 1876. Most of this timber is the produce of the B\u00e1riya, Sanjeli, and other forests surrounding the Panch Mah\u00e1ls; the rest comes from the Panch Mah\u00e1ls forests. The trade centres in Godhra where, with a certain number of Hindu and other timber merchants, the chief dealers are Musalm\u00e1ns of the sect of Shia Bohor\u00e1s. There is little teak of any size. The produce is mainly small teak rafters and poles, beams of other forest trees and bamboos. At Godhra the dealers buy timber from Bhils and Kolis, who bring it to market. But the sellers to secure higher prices often prefer to carry their timber to P\u00e1li and even to D\u00e1kor and Nadi\u00e1d. Most timber is\n\n---\n\n1 The following shows the area and (1872) population of the districts of which Godhra is the natural centre:\n\n| District       | Area | Population, 1872 |\n|----------------|------|------------------|\n| Panch Mah\u00e1ls   | 1731 | 240,743          |\n| Sunth          | 394  | 49,675           |\n| B\u00e1riya         | 813  | 52,813           |\n| Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da       | 388  | 74,813           |\n| P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s   | 113  | 35,610           |\n| **Total**      | **3439** | **453,654**     |\nbrought to Godhra by Kolis. But of late years Gh\u00e1nchis and other Musalm\u00e1ns have begun to compete in this branch of the carrying trade. The Government Forest Department sells chiefly to dealers and disposes of much of its supply wholesale in the forests. Of late years the timber trade has been rapidly increasing, the P\u00e1li railway and new roads opening out more distant areas of supply. The falling off in the last year is only apparent. It is because firewood has been taken as a separate item. In reality there is a large increase.\n\nThere is a considerable Grain trade from all parts of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and from the neighbouring states. But the supplies chiefly come from the Dohad sub-division. Gram, by far the heaviest item, goes to Bombay and Gujar\u00e1t; maize is not usually exported in any quantities though in 1870-71 owing to failure of crops in the west, the export rose to 2429 tons. Grain exports vary much according to the harvests as well as to the relative prices and demand from M\u00e1lwa, Mew\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t. Wheat and rice are exported from Dohad and rice from Kalol. Under ordinary conditions the grain trade is growing and likely to grow.\n\nAlmost all of the dried flower and fruit of the mahuda, Bassia latifolia, the produce of Godhra and the surrounding native territory, goes west to Gujar\u00e1t. The crop ripens in April. Gathered chiefly by Bhils and Kolis it is made over to V\u00e1ni\u00e1s and other men of capital who either dispose of it to P\u00e1rsi contractors or export it at their own risk. Most of it finds its way to Surat and Bombay.\n\nMahuda is one of the articles most affected by the opening of the P\u00e1li railway. Before 1873 the trade set to Baroda and Anand, passing either by rail or by road to Broach and from Broach by sea to Bombay. Now the trade centres in P\u00e1li. The export has risen from 947 tons in 1873 to 9249 in 1877. The large increase in the last two years was owing to favourable seasons, to the new roads and railways, and to the additional area tapped. The amount of mahuda available for export, depending on the grain as well as the mahuda crop, varies greatly from year to year. Of the amount all, except three tons in 1873 and 149 in 1876, went westwards to P\u00e1li and Baroda.\n\n---\n\n1 This is a trade of long standing, wheat and barley were (1586) brought from M\u00e1lwa to Gujar\u00e1t. Gladwin's Ain-i-Akbari, II. 62.\nDISTRICTS.\n\nChapter VI.\nTrade.\n1874-1878.\nFirewood.\n\nFirewood is to a great extent a new export. Before the opening of the P\u00e1li railway very little crossed the Mahi. This trade, almost confined to the Godhra and K\u00e1lol sub-divisions, employs Kolis, Musalm\u00e1ns, Gh\u00e1nchis, and others. It is rapidly developing, the chief buyers being the mills at Ahmedabad and in other parts of Gujar\u00e1t. The forest and waste tracts yield a large annual growth of firewood now for the first time made use of, and if the railway is taken on to Godhra a still large area will be thrown open.\n\nOilseeds.\n\nPanch Mah\u00e1ls Exports, Oilseeds, 1873-1877.\n\n| YEAR | Godhra and P\u00e1li | Godhra and Baroda | Total |\n|------|----------------|-------------------|-------|\n|      | Tons.          | Tons.             | Tons. |\n| 1873-74 | 398           | 286               | 684   |\n| 1874-75 | 1198          | 385               | 1583  |\n| 1875-76 | 796           | 432               | 1228  |\n| 1876-77 | 266           | 291               | 557   |\n| 1877-78 | 1265          | 244               | 1509  |\n\nOf oilseeds sesamum, tal, is mostly grown in Dohad and Jh\u00e1lod, and castor oil in Godhra and K\u00e1lol. They are all sent to Gujar\u00e1t. So far the quantities have varied according to the character of the seasons. But a gradual increase in the export of oilseeds may be looked for.\n\nImports.\n\nTobacco.\n\nPanch Mah\u00e1ls Imports, Tobacco, 1873-1877.\n\n| YEAR | Godhra and P\u00e1li | Godhra and Baroda | Total |\n|------|----------------|-------------------|-------|\n|      | Tons.          | Tons.             | Tons. |\n| 1873-74 | 1973          |                   | 1973  |\n| 1874-75 | 1876          |                   | 1876  |\n| 1875-76 | 2261          |                   | 2261  |\n| 1876-77 | 1942          |                   | 1942  |\n| 1877-78 | 2659          | 9                 | 2668  |\n\nOf imports tobacco is the chief. The marginal figures show the changes in the trade during the last five years. There is little to add to what has already been said under the head \u2018through trade.\u2019\n\nSalt.\n\nLike tobacco, salt has been treated under the head \u2018through trade.\u2019 Besides what goes to M\u00e1lwa there is a large local demand in and near the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. But from the former abuses connected with the carrying of salt on pack bullocks no accurate returns are available. The figures for 1877-78 are fairly correct. At present the import of salt is increasing.\n\nCartage.\n\nFifteen to twenty years ago mile cartage rates varied from 7\u00bdd. to 1s. (5-8 annas) a ton. Now the rates are much less. Cartage rates are usually quoted in the local markets at so much the 40 lbs., man, for the journey, including as a rule transit duties and tolls. Between P\u00e1li and Dohad a distance of sixty-two miles the present mileage charge is about 3d. (2 annas) a ton, of which nearly \u00bcd. (6 pies) is for tolls and duties. From Dohad to Ratl\u00e1m, about 74 miles, the mile rate for tobacco and salt varies from 7\u00bdd. to 10\u00bdd.\nPANCH MAHA'LS.\n\n(5-7 annas) the ton and of this from 2\u00bdd. to 3d. (1\u00bd - 2 annas) is for tolls and duties. Excluding duties and tolls a mile rate varying according to season and demand from 2\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. (1\u00bd-3 annas) a ton gives the present range of Panch Mah\u00e1ls cart hire. In old days the carrying trade was almost monopolized by Musalm\u00e1ns of the Gh\u00e1nchi class and on account of bad roads and want of protection was avoided by others. Now as the roads are safe and good, competition among all classes who have carts and bullocks is most eager and many persons come from great distances to carry on the Godhra and P\u00e1li road.\n\nThe only industry of special interest is in Dohad the making of lac bracelets.\u00b9 The lac is produced in small quantities in Dohad and largely in the forests of the neighbouring states of Ali R\u00e1jpur, Udepur, and Devgad B\u00e1r\u00edya. The chief lac-yielding trees are the pipla, Ficus religiosa, the kh\u00e1khra, Butea frondosa, the bordi, Zizyphus jujuba, and the kusamb, Schleichera trijuga.\n\nThe lac is collected by Bhils and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s who either for grain or cash sell it to the Bohora or V\u00e1n\u00edya grain-dealers at from 1d. to 1\u00bdd. a pound (Rs. 1-8-Rs. 2 a man), who in turn sell it to town traders almost all Musalm\u00e1ns of the Shia or D\u00e1ndi Bohora sect. When it comes to the traders the lac is in a raw state sticking to bark and twigs. To separate the lac from the wood the whole is pounded with stones and winnowed. In this state the powdered lac, kanja, is stored, its price in ordinary years varying from 10s. to 16s. for 40 pounds (Rs. 5-Rs. 8 a man), the cheapest coming from the pipla, kh\u00e1khra and bordi, and the dearest from the kusamb trees. Of the whole supply only a little is locally worked up into lac bracelets. Of the rest in ordinary years about 5 tons (280 mans) go to Ahmedabad and 7\u00bd tons (400 mans) to Ratl\u00e1m. In Ahmedabad the lac is used for colouring leather, and in Ratl\u00e1m for making bracelets.\n\nBefore being used the powdered lac, kanja, is placed in a bamboo basket, mixed with powdered alum, washed with water, and for a day set to dry in the sun. Then it is ground to powder, melted in a metal pan, and in the proportion of two ounces to the pound (five tol\u00e1s to one ser) mixed with brick dust and old powdered lac bracelets. The mixture is melted, poured on the ground, and rolled into a round flat cake. The cake is cut into three or four pieces, each piece heated and between two stones rolled into a stick generally 5\u00bd pounds in weight. The stick ready, some dearer lac is mixed with yellow orpiment, or red earth, or both, and made into small cakes from five to six ounces in weight. Then these yellow or red cakes are laid as an outside coating, on the first lac stick, in such a way as to make it all red or all yellow, or one side red and the other yellow. The end of the stick is then heated, drawn out, and then the proper length for a bracelet cut off. As they are formed, the bracelets are slipped over the oily conical head of a pestle-shaped tool known as the 'rice-pounder,' s\u00e1mel\u00e1. This has usually a head about ten inches long, varying in size from two inches across the top to four inches across the foot, and a handle about a foot and a half long. When the head has been covered with rings they are carefully heated so that\n\n\u00b9 Checked and added to by Bamanji Modi, Esquire, District Deputy Collector.\nwithout melting the rings may stick to each other. This done, the set of rings is taken off, rubbed with brick powder, polished and either with copal varnish or with a mixture of gumarine, chandrus, and linseed oil, coloured vermillion, blue, or yellow.\n\nWhen the cylinder of bracelets has been coloured the next step is to print a pattern on them. For this purpose about two ounces of tin, kathir, are melted into a thin plate and rolled round a small ball of glue. The ball is then set on a stone and for a whole day hammered by two men, the particles mixing together till they form a dull-grey metallic plate. Next day the plate is broken in pieces, thrown into a copper vessel with a little water in it, and placed over a slow fire. The plate gradually melts leaving a sediment sometimes strained off through a coarse cloth. The water is now ready for use. Meanwhile a little very fine cotton wool is tightly wound round a small bamboo chip and so wetted and pressed that it makes a pad or stamp hard enough to have a pattern graven on its face by a large iron needle. This cotton stamp is now taken, dipped in the tinwater, and being very lightly pressed on the cylinder of bracelets prints its pattern on their varnish. After printing the bracelet the cylinder is varnished once a day for three days, the varnish turning the white markings of the tin pattern into a beautiful gold. Then the pattern is completed by studding the bracelet with drops of tinwater coloured red with vermillion or white with chalk. A final coating of varnish finishes the work. When they are to be sold the bangles are separated from each other by a knife-like tool. Each bangle is then cut, passed over the wearer's hand, and the ends melted and joined. The bracelets are sold two for 3\u00bdd. (a pice) generally in sets of twenty-five for each hand. They are generally worn by the V\u00e2nia women of M\u00e2lwa, and by Dohad women of the Rajput, Patelia, and R\u00e2valia castes.\n\nThese lac bracelets are an imitation of the costly ivory Ratl\u00e1m bracelets, of which a woman generally gets one set at her marriage, wearing them only on very great occasions. Besides bracelets, yellow and red striped armlets, goli\u00e1s, are worn between the elbow and the shoulder. Except that they have neither varnish nor pattern these are made in the same way as the bracelets. Two of them sell for 3\u00bdd. (a pice.) The manufacture of lac bracelets gives employment to a special class of craftsmen called L\u00e2kh\u00e2r\u00e1s. Of these six families are settled at Jh\u00e2lod and nine at Dohad. About half of them are Musalm\u00e1ns and half Hindus.\n\nAnother industry is the manufacture in the villages of Jesv\u00e1da and G\u00e1ngdi in Dohad of blackwood hair combs. The makers are Musalm\u00e1ns called from their occupation k\u00e1nshigars or comb makers. Their combs are bought wholesale by Doh\u00e2d D\u00e1udi Bohor\u00e1s who polish and finish them and send them to M\u00e2lwa, Gujar\u00e1t, and even to Burh\u00e1npur.\n\nIn former times paper, soap, and grass oil were made, and Ch\u00e2mp\u00e2ner was famous for its cloth-bleaching, calico-printing, silk-weaving, and sword blades. These industries have almost entirely disappeared. The grass oil made from the large long-bladed\naromatic grass known as *roisa*, which used to grow over large stretches of waste land was, at the rate of 4s. (Rs. 2) a pound, bought in considerable quantities and used partly as a remedy for rheumatism, partly to mix with *attar* of roses. The oil was extracted by distillation. A rough stone oven was built by the side of a stream and in it a large metal caldron was placed and filled with bundles of grass and water. When full, a wooden lid was put on and sealed with a plaster of ground pulse, *adad*. Through a hole in the lid one end of a hollow bamboo was thrust and the other end passed into a smaller metal vessel securely fixed under water in the bed of the stream. The oven was then heated and the vapour passing through the hollow bamboo was by the coldness of the smaller vessel precipitated as oil.\n\n*Saml\u00e1ji* in the Mahi K\u00e1ntha and D\u00e1kor in Kaira are at the times of their great religious gatherings places of considerable traffic. But few of the local fairs are of any trading importance. Except some in the west who go as far as Baroda and P\u00e1li most well-to-do cultivators generally bring their produce to Godhra, K\u00e1lol, Vejalpur, Dohad, Limdi, Garbada, G\u00e1ngdi, and Jh\u00e1lod, permanent marts with resident dealers in grain, cloth, oil seeds, grocery, and hardware. Many of the smaller villages and almost all of the Bhil settlements are without regular shops, the Bhils doing most of their buying and selling with one of their own money-lenders or large village dealers. There is also a class of village traders M\u00e1rv\u00e1di V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s in the east, and Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, and a few Musalm\u00e1n Bohor\u00e1s and Gh\u00e1chis in the west, some of whom live in villages during the whole and some during part of the year.\n\nThough with so scanty and backward a population, each town has its merchant's guild, *mah\u00e1jan*, regulating trade. Last year (1877) with the object of lowering prices the *mah\u00e1jan* of Jh\u00e1lod agreed to stop the export of grain. This year (1878) too they did the same. But at the persuasion of the local authorities the agreement was rescinded. Where members of a craft belong to the same caste, the caste council, *panch*, sometimes hears and settles disputes on points of trade. The councils of more than one caste have, to prevent a fall in wages, been known to join in striking work and occasionally two castes have together appointed a special council to settle trade disputes. The V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s and Son\u00eds, together spoken of as the *mah\u00e1jan*, have been known to unite in stopping business as a protest against a distasteful sanitary order. But the combination was partly religious, partly social, and neither depended on, nor called forth any special trade organization.\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nThe history of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls centres in the city of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. In a copper plate inscription of Shil\u00e1ditya V. of Valabhi bearing date 404-441 Samvat, A.D. 848-858, reference is made to the camp of victory fixed at Godhr\u00e1haka and this may be the modern Godhra. No other early mention of the district has been traced. Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner is said to have been founded in the seventh century (647) in the reign of Van R\u00e1j, the first ruler of Anhilv\u00e1da. In the end of the thirteenth century (1297) the Choh\u00e1ns retreating from Khichiv\u00e1da before the Musalm\u00e1ns under Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji became lords of the country. Their sway lasted till the conquest of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner by Mahmud Begada in 1484. During the next fifty years the neighbourhood of the city would seem to have been one of the richest parts of Gujar\u00e1t. Barbosa (1514) describes it as full of well tilled fields and rich in all products. So too the author of the Mirat-i-Sikandri (1611) is eloquent in praise of its fruits, its mangoes the best in the kingdom, and its sandalwood so plentiful as to be used in house building. Deserted by the court before the middle of the sixteenth century (1536), Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner had by its close become ruined, and much of the country had fallen into wilds and forests. Under the Moghal Emperors (1573-1727) Godhra became the district head quarters. But, unlike the rest of Gujar\u00e1t, the Panch Mah\u00e1ls seem never to have prospered under the Viceroys or regained their lost cultivation or wealth. Occasionally an Emperor or a Viceroy in travelling from M\u00e1lwa to Gujar\u00e1t passed through the district. But its chief mention in the seventeenth century is as a hunting ground for wild elephants.\n\nIn 1727 Krishn\u00e1ji, foster son of Kant\u00e1ji Kadam B\u00e1nde, attacked Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, levied a regular tribute, and seems to have held the country till about the middle of the century Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner was seized and the Panch Mah\u00e1ls annexed by Sindia.

Even the citadel was restored to Sindia in the next year and remained in his hands till in 1853 the district was transferred to the British. During this time, as an outlying part of Sindia's domain, the management of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls was very loose and unsatisfactory.\\(^1\\) In 1825 the greater part of the eastern division was covered with forest,\\(^2\\) and though some advance was afterwards made, in 1853 when the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were transferred to the British they were still in a very backward state.\n\nUnder British rule order was established and with two exceptions has been maintained. The exceptions are an inroad of mutineers in 1858 and a Naikda rising ten years later.\n\nIn 1858,\\(^3\\) after his defeat at Gwalior, at the close of the mutinies in Northern India, T\u00e1tia Topi moved rapidly towards the Deccan. The chiefs of Jamkhandi and Nargund had been in treasonable correspondence with the rebel chiefs in the North-West and had invoked their aid. It is more than probable that if T\u00e1tia Topi had entered the Deccan in force, there would have been a general insurrection of the Mar\u00e1tha population. T\u00e1tia's march to the Deccan soon assumed the character of a flight. He was closely pressed by two columns under Generals Somerset and Mitchell, and a very compact and enterprising little field force commanded by Colonel Park.\n\nColonel Park's own regiment, the 72nd Highlanders, many of the men mounted on camels, formed the main fighting power of this force. His indefatigable energy in the pursuit of the enemy allowed them no rest, and eventually brought them to bay at Chhota Udepur.\n\nFearing to face the open country of Ber\u00e1r with such an uncompromising enemy in pursuit, T\u00e1tia recrossed the Narbada at Chikalda and marched towards Baroda. He had, by means of an agent named Ganpatr\u00e1v, for some time been in communication with the Bh\u00e1u S\u00e1heb Pov\u00e1r, a brother-in-law of His Highness the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r, and had been led to expect aid from the Baroda Sard\u00e1rs and the Th\u00e1kors of the Kaira and Rewa K\u00e1ntha districts. Immediately it became known that T\u00e1tia had crossed the Narbada, troops were put in motion from Kaira, Ahmedabad, and Deesa for the protection of the eastern frontier of Gujar\u00e1t. Captain Thatcher, who had succeeded to the command of the irregular levies raised by Mr. Ashburner in Kaira, was ordered to hold Sankheda with the irregulars and two of the Ga\u00edkw\u00e1r's guns. He was afterwards reinforced by Captain Collier's detachment of the 7th Regiment N. I., which fell back from Chhota Udepur on the approach of the enemy.\n\nT\u00e1tia Topi at this time commanded a formidable force composed of fragments of many mutinous Bengal regiments. He had also been joined by a mixed rabble of Villayatis, Rohill\u00e1s, and Rajputs, who followed his fortune in hopes of plunder. The Naw\u00e1b of Kamona, Ferozsha, and a Mar\u00e1tha Sard\u00e1r, who was known as the R\u00e1v S\u00e1heb, held subordinate commands. Each fighting man was followed by\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom.

R. Ashburner, C.S.I.\none or more ponies laden with plunder which greatly impeded their movements. It was chiefly owing to this that Colonel Park was enabled to overtake the rebels and to force them into action.\n\nOn reaching Chhota Udepur the troops of the R\u00e1ja fraternized with the enemy, and Captain Collier having evacuated the town, T\u00e1tia Topi was allowed to occupy it without opposition. He had intended to halt at Chhota Udepur to recruit his men and to develop his intrigues with the Baroda Sard\u00e1rs, but Park gave him no respite. On the 1st December 1858, he fell upon T\u00e1tia\u2019s rebel force and defeated it with great slaughter, his own loss being trifling. After this defeat there was great confusion in the ranks of the insurgents. T\u00e1tia Topi abandoned his army and did not rejoin it till it had reached the forest lands of P\u00e1rona. Discipline, which had always been lax, was now entirely thrown aside. The muster roll of one of T\u00e1tia\u2019s cavalry regiments was picked up and showed that out of a strength of 300 sabres there were only sixteen present for duty. The rebel force separated into two bodies, one doubled back and plundered Park\u2019s baggage, which had fallen far to the rear, the other under Ferozsha entered the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and looted B\u00e1r\u00edya, Jh\u00e1lod, Limdi and other villages; Godhra being covered by Muter\u2019s force was not attacked. Park\u2019s force was so disabled by the plunder of its baggage and by long continued forced marches, that it was compelled to halt at Chhota Udepur, but General Somerset took up the pursuit and rapidly drove T\u00e1tia from the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. He fled in the direction of Salumba. The Th\u00e1kor of that place was in arms, and T\u00e1tia no doubt expected support from him, but the Th\u00e1kor was too cautious to join what was then evidently a hopeless cause. On reaching Nargad on the 20th February 1859, Ferozsha made overtures of surrender, and a week later 300 cavalry and a mixed force of 1500 men under Zahur Ali and the Molvi Vazir Kh\u00e1n laid down their arms to General Mitchell. They were admitted to the benefit of the amnesty. The remnant of T\u00e1tia\u2019s force fled to the north-east.\n\nIn October 1858, instigated by the intrigues of the Bh\u00e1u S\u00e1heb Pov\u00e1r, the Sankheda N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s, a very wild forest tribe, took up arms under Rupa and Keval N\u00e1iks, and after having plundered the outpost, th\u00e1na, at N\u00e1rukot, attacked a detachment of the 8th Regiment N. I. under Captain Bates at J\u00e1mbughoda. They were repulsed with considerable loss after a desultory fight during the greater part of two days. On the arrest of Ganpatr\u00e1v, the Bh\u00e1u S\u00e1heb\u2019s agent, this troublesome insurrection would probably have collapsed, but the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s were joined by a number of Vill\u00e1yatis, matchlock men, the fragments of T\u00e1tia\u2019s broken force, who encouraged them to hold out. They occupied the very strong country between Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner and N\u00e1rukot, and kept up a harassing warfare, plundering the villages as far north as Godhra.\n\nA field force commanded by the Political Agent of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha, Colonel Wallace, was employed against the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s during the cold weather of 1858, and in one of the frequent skirmishes with the insurgents Captain Hayward of the 17th Regiment N. I. was\n\n---\n\n1 Details of the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s are given at page 222.\nseverely wounded by a matchlock bullet on January 28th, 1859. The only success obtained by the Naikdas was the surprise of Hassan Ali\u2019s company of Hussein Khan\u2019s levy. The Subhedar had been ordered to protect the labourers who were employed in opening the pass near the village of Sivrajpur, but the duty was very distasteful to him, and his son deserted with twenty-four men on the march to Sivrajpur. They were suddenly attacked by a mixed force of Makranis and Naikdas. Seven men including the Subhedar were killed and eleven wounded without any loss to the enemy. The Subhedar neglected to protect his camp by the most ordinary precautions and his men appear to have behaved badly. They fled without firing a shot directly they were attacked. But little progress had been made in pacifying the Naikdas till Captain Richard Bonner was employed to raise and organize a corps composed chiefly of Bhils with their head quarters at Dohad in the Panch Mahals. Captain Bonner\u2019s untiring energy and moral influence soon reduced the Naikdas to submission. Rupa Naik laid down his arms and accepted the amnesty, March 10th, 1859, and Keval Naik followed his example soon after.\n\nAfter ten years of quiet and steady progress, in 1868, the Naikdas again rose in revolt. Towards the close of 1867, Joria, a Naikda of the village of Vadek about 1\u00bd miles north-west of Jambughoda, began to act as a Bhagat or inspired man. Giving out that he was Parameshvar, or the supreme lord, he claimed to have the power of working miracles, preached the purest morality, made converts, and for a man of his position showed a surprising knowledge of Hindu mythology and ritual. So great was his success that to be allowed to come near him was thought a high favour, and numbers of worshippers, some of them men of good caste and position, followed him from place to place seeking his blessing. About the middle of January 1868 Joria gained a most useful adherent in Rupsingh Gobar, proprietor of Dandiapur. A pardoned rebel and outlaw, Rupsingh, though a Naikda and uneducated, from his natural ability, shrewdness, and tact had gained much power over the people of his tribe. Under his influence Joria, leaving his scheme of moral reform, agreed to join in raising a kingdom of which Joria should be the spiritual and Rupsingh the temporal head. Joria\u2019s birthplace, the village of Vadek, was chosen as the royal seat. A joint court was established and revenue collected, partly from religious gifts and fines, partly by the levy of transit dues. Of these doings and of the accompanying local excitement, the native officials took no notice and sent no word to the Governor\u2019s Agent then in a distant part of the district. Before long the new rulers took more open steps to advance their power. In the end of January Rupsingh revived an old claim to share in the revenue of Rajgad, a police station near Narukot. His claim was\n\n---\n\n1 He held spiritual court, himself supreme, and under him many grades of lower gods and attendants, Rupsingh his chief supporter giving up his daughters to play the part of Gopis. So elaborate was his scheme that it seemed the work of some Brahman or religious beggar. After his capture every effort was made to trace Brahman help. But there was nothing to show that Joria had not himself worked out all the details.\nrejected. A few days after (February 2nd) collecting a body of Naikdas and bringing Joria Bhagat with him Rupsingh came to Rajgad. Leaving the Naikdas and Joria outside of the bamboo pallisade, Rupsingh and his sons went into the station and inviting the Makrani garrison to go out and see the holy personage, seated themselves beside the commandant and some other officers of the post. After a time the talk ran on Joria\u2019s spiritual power and pretensions. One of the officials holding out his closed hand asked in jest if the divinity could tell what was in his hand. \u2018There is death in it,\u2019 shouted Galalia, Rupsingh\u2019s eldest son, and drawing his sword cut the man down. The commandant escaped through a window and the Makrani guard, outside of the stockade and unarmed, fled. The Naikdas swarmed in, broke open the treasure chest and ransacked the place.\n\nRupsingh lost no time in following up this success. Jambughoda about fourteen miles from Rajgad, though a place of no strength, was the chief post in the neighbourhood with a guard of about thirty armed police. To the commandant of this post Rupsingh sent word: \u2018Make ready to fight, for Rupsingh is on the way.\u2019 On February 4th about three in the afternoon, seeing bands of Naikdas coming towards the station, the Jambughoda commandant drew up his men opposite an opening in the fence. From the advancing crowd three Bhagat consecrated champions, their bare bodies smeared with red paint, came forward, shot arrows, and grasping their swords rushed at the stockade. As they came the guard fired a volley, their bullets, so they said, dashing the paint off the champions\u2019 bodies but doing them no harm. By this time the champions were within the enclosure, and the panic-struck police, leaving two of their number dead, took to flight. The station was pillaged, the records torn, and the shops and houses sacked. After this the village of Jetpur, at the time the residence of the Chhota Udepur chief, was taken, the chief flying for his life. Though successful, this attack on Jetpur did much to shake his followers\u2019 trust in Joria. Two of his wound-proof warriors were shot dead. The Bhagat said they were not dead, and sent the bodies to Vadek, declaring that if British troops came against them they would rise and fight. But after a day or two at Vadek the house where the bodies lay was burnt and, in spite of his explanation that the men had died because they had disobeyed his orders, the trust in Joria\u2019s power was shaken.\n\nHearing that the old outlaw Rupsingh was \u2018out\u2019 and had sacked Rajgad, the Agent to the Governor and the Superintendent and assistant superintendent of police, then about eighty miles off in Dohad, sending an express to Baroda and Ahmedabad for military aid, started with an escort of twenty-five of the Bhil corps and by cross-country tracks pushed straight for Jambughoda. On the way they were met by news of the capture of Jambughoda, and as with their small body of Bhils it was useless to enter the disturbed country, at Halol about twenty-five miles west of Jambughoda they waited the arrival of the troops. On the evening of the 11th, 200 men of the\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Propert was Governor\u2019s Agent, Captain Segrave Superintendent, and Lieut. Westmacott assistant superintendent of police.\n26th Native Infantry, under the command of two European officers, came from Baroda, and on the same day the camp was joined by the Police Commissioner. Next day (February, 12th), as 200 of the 6th Native Infantry were due from Ahmedabad, it was settled to leave a small garrison in H\u00e1lol and press on with the main body to Sivr\u00e1jpur, about eleven miles east, on the way to J\u00e1mbughoda. Sivr\u00e1jpur was reached without annoyance. Next day, the 13th, one of the Ahmedabad companies arrived at Sivr\u00e1jpur and the other marched to R\u00e9jgad to join the Rewa K\u00e1nta Political Agent. During these days the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s at Vadek were full of the wildest trust and z\u00e9al. Almost every soul, for about twenty miles round, believed that the British Government was at an end, and that under Rupsingh and Joria a dharamr\u00e1j or religious rule had begun. In their former fights with trained troops the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s carefully avoiding the open, by sudden night attacks, had wearied their opponents. But now, as they seemed to have given up their old tactics, every effort was made to lose no time in letting them try the chance of an open fight. Leaving fifty of the 6th Native Infantry and twenty-five of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s Makr\u00e1n\u00eds at Sivr\u00e1jpur, on the morning of the 15th the force advanced safely and without hindrance to J\u00e1mbughoda. At Vadek the news that the greater number of the troops had left, emboldened the insurgents to attack Sivr\u00e1jpur. News of their design reached the garrison, and the position, nothing more than a bivouac under some large trees, was strengthened by a cart barricade. At dusk with shouts of R\u00e1m, R\u00e1m, the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s poured out of the forest and led by one of their wound-proof warriors, shooting arrows and firing matchlocks charged the camp. Met by a steady fire they retired with loss, and before dawn after two more fruitless efforts, carrying their dead with them, they withdrew to Vadek.\n\nEarly on the same morning (Sunday, February 16th) starting from J\u00e1mbughoda the British troops marched against Vadek. On nearing the village small parties of N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s were seen scattered over the hill sides and on the level ground. As the troops came closer one man in bright yellow and red was conspicuous moving about with a band of followers, some dancing in religious frenzy, others armed with bows and arrows. At first unconcerned, the leader and his band suddenly made for the hill. To cut off their retreat the cavalry led by Captain Macleod dashed forward. But two attempts to strike the man in red and yellow failed and except the police inspector and a native officer of the Poona Horse, the troopers, believing that the N\u00e1ikda leader had a charmed life, fell back.\n\n---\n\n1 Captain Macleod and Lieutenant Resy.\n2 Mr. Rogers.\n3 The Political Agent was Major Barton; the officers in charge of the companies Captain Sithorpe and Lieut. Burnes.\n4 Of the garrison none were killed; six Makr\u00e1n\u00eds and one of the 26th Native Infantry were wounded. Of the N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s twenty-eight were killed and wounded.\n5 The force was under the command of Captain Macleod. It consisted of a detachment of H. M.\u2019s 26th Native Infantry; a few of the 8th Native Infantry; fifty of the Gujar\u00e1t Bhil corps; eighty Arabs from Baroda; and about thirty mounted police. The European officers present were Captain Macleod, Lieut. Burnes, Lieut. Resy, Captain Segrave, Lieut. Westmacott, Mr. Rogers, and Mr. Propert. Agent, 167, 18th February 1868.\nAgainst the three unsided horsemen the Naikdas plied their arrows with such effect that the Risaldar of the Poona Horse was killed and Captain Macleod twice narrowly escaped. Emboldened by this success the Naikdas, though the infantry were close upon them, kept advancing, till as their foremost men reached the bank of a water-course, a shot from each of the three district officers laid low the leader in red and yellow and two of his chief supporters. With the loss of nine of their number the Naikdas fled, and the rising was at an end.\n\nThe slain leader was at first thought to be Joria. But Joria had escaped, and this was a deputy whom in token of his trust Joria had decked in his own clothes. Rupsingh's second son was among the killed and Rupsingh though he escaped was wounded. Order was soon restored. The people, on the assurance that their misconduct would be forgiven, came in and settled in their villages. The four chief criminals, Joria the Bhagat, Rupsingh, his eldest son Galalia, and his minister were still at large. But by unceasing pursuit in less than a month all were secured and after trial, were with one of Joria's spiritual champions who had taken an active part in the sack of Jambughoda, convicted and hanged.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 This account is taken from Mr. Propert's Report, Bom. Gov. Pol. Rec. No. 102 of 1868, and from \"Our Little War with the Naikdas.\" Cornhill Magazine, XVIII. 626-640.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION.\n\nThere are two periods in the British management of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls; eight years (1853-1860) when they were held in charge for His Highness Sindia, and eighteen years (1861-1878) since they have formed one of the British districts of the Bombay Presidency.\n\nFor years after order had been established in the Rewa and Mah\u00ed K\u00e1ntha districts, in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls crime was unpunished and wrongs unrepressed, and from the weakness of their ruler the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were a source of danger and annoyance to the neighbouring states. In 1852 the Bombay Government pressed for some change; their complaints were, by the Governor General's Agent, laid before His Highness Sindia, and an arrangement made that for ten years the territories should be placed under the charge of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Political Agent who, with the surplus revenue, was to forward a yearly financial statement to the Governor General's Agent at Gwalior. This proposal was approved by the Government of India (3rd June 1853), and under orders from the Government of Bombay Major Fulljames (30th July 1853) took the district under his charge.\n\nBefore the ten years were over, His Highness Sindia, in exchange for lands near Jh\u00e1nsi, on the 19th March 1861, handed over the Panch Mah\u00e1ls to the British Government. In the eighteen years that have since passed three changes have been made in the management of the district. For a little more than three years (March 1861 - May 1864) the Panch Mah\u00e1ls continued part of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Political Agent's charge; they were then transferred to Kaira and placed under the management of an officer styled the First Assistant Collector, and Agent to the Governor. In 1877 a scheme was sanctioned for making the Panch Mah\u00e1ls a separate collectorship and giving the Collector political charge of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha states.\n\nThough placed under the charge of an Assistant Collector and financially part of Kaira, from their backward state and the poverty and ignorance of the people, the judicial system in force in other British districts has not been introduced into the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. In criminal matters, courts up to the rank of District Magistrate's courts, are regularly constituted under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. But as Agent to the Governor the powers of a Sessions Judge are vested in the District Magistrate and from his decisions and\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Gen. Agent at Gwalior 444, 28th December 1852. Government of India 2550, 3rd June 1853.\n2 Bom. Gov. Letter 1130, 19th March 1861.\n3 Bom. Gov. Res. 1658, 30th April 1864.\norders appeals and references lie to Government and not to the High Court. Similarly, in matters of civil justice, an appeal lies from the munsif's decisions to the Agent to the Governor, and from the Agent to Government. The present administrative staff consists of the Agent to the Governor and his assistant in revenue charge of the Godhra and K\u00e1lol sub-divisions, who, in criminal matters, is a first class magistrate and in civil matters has power to hear appeals from the decisions of munsifs. There is also a deputy collector with revenue and magisterial charge of the Dohad sub-division.\n\nSince its acquisition the limits of the district have not been changed. The lands are distributed over three sub-divisions, two of them including petty divisions. These form two groups, Godhra and K\u00e1lol, with its petty division of H\u00e1lo in the west, generally the charge of the covenanted assistant, and Dohad, with its petty division of Jh\u00e1lod in the east, the charge of the uncovenanted assistant. These officers are also assistants to the extra First Assistant Collector as District Magistrate, and have under his presidency the chief management of the different administrative bodies, local fund and municipal committees, within the limits of their revenue charge. Under the supervision of the extra First Assistant Collector and his assistant or deputy the revenue charge of each fiscal division of the district is placed in the hands of an officer styled m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r. These functionaries, who are also entrusted with magisterial powers, have yearly salaries varying from \u00a3150 to \u00a3210 (Rs. 1500 - Rs. 2100). Two of the fiscal divisions, K\u00e1lol and Dohad, contain each a petty division, peta mah\u00e1l, placed under the charge of an officer styled mah\u00e1lkar\u00ed. These mah\u00e1lkar\u00eds, except that they have no treasuries to superintend, exercise the revenue and magisterial powers generally entrusted to a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r. The yearly pay of each of the mah\u00e1lkar\u00eds is \u00a372 (Rs. 720).\n\nIn revenue and police matters the charge of the 638 Government villages is entrusted to 801 headmen, of whom ten are stipendiary and 791 hereditary. 342 of the hereditary headmen perform revenue duties only, and eighty-one attend to matters of police only. Of the stipendiary patels one attends to police duty only, while nine stipendiary and 368 hereditary headmen are entrusted with both revenue and police functions. As regards the emoluments of these headmen and of other village servants, except accountants, and yearly or half-yearly messengers, as the whole district has not been surveyed, details are not available.\n\nVillage accountants, tal\u00e1t\u00eds, who under the headmen keep the village accounts and draw up statistical and other returns, number in all 130 or about one accountant for every five villages. Many villages held on proprietary, talukdari, leasehold, or similar tenures have no accountants. Their yearly salaries paid in cash, averaging \u00a314 6s. (Rs. 143), vary from \u00a31 16s. to \u00a31 (Rs. 18 - Rs. 10), and represent a total yearly charge of \u00a31867 (Rs. 18,670). Under the headmen and accountants are the village servants 766 in number, r\u00e1vani\u00e1s, pagis, kotv\u00e1ls, and hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs. They are liable both for revenue and for police duties. The messengers, hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs, are mostly Musalm\u00e1ns, and the r\u00e1vani\u00e1s and others generally Kolis and Bhils.\nExcept the messengers, most of these servants are paid in land. Till the survey is finished the value of their holdings cannot be ascertained.\n\nThe messengers, havildars, are paid in cash at the monthly rate of 10s. (Rs. 5) each. Of these, eleven are employed for the whole year, and 118 for six months, from January to June. The total yearly charge on account of these messengers amounts to \u00a3425 (Rs. 4250). The yearly cost of the village establishment who are paid in cash is as follows: Village accountants \u00a31867 (Rs. 18,670) and village servants \u00a3425 (Rs. 4250), total \u00a32292 (Rs. 22,920.). This, exclusive of the heavier charges on account of the rent-free lands, represents a charge of \u00a33 11s. 10d. (Rs. 35-15-0) on each village, or about 8\u00bd per cent of the entire land revenue of the district.\n\nWhen (1853) His Highness Sindia handed over the Panch Mahals to British management, the greatest disorder prevailed. For years the district had been in the hands of revenue contractors, who so long as they paid the amount they had bid, were allowed to manage the district as they chose. Under them was a military force, siband, distributed through the district in outposts, thandas. The contractors realized their revenue demands from the heads of single villages, from chiefs and large landowners who held several villages, and from speculators who contracted for the revenue of village groups. In the unsettled state of the district most of the larger landowners and sub-contractors had engaged mercenaries and in several instances had attacked and driven away the chief contractor's militia outposts. As the chiefs seldom willingly paid their tribute sureties were required. These in the absence of any body of rich merchants were generally men in a high position in the chief contractor's forces. In return for their service as sureties these mercenaries exacted interest from the chiefs at from 24 to 36 per cent, and if he could not pay billeted on him a certain number of men.\u00b9 This was the general state of things in all parts of the\n\n\u00b9 The following are examples. The Thakor of Sonipur south-east of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad a proprietor of forty villages chiefly waste was indebted to the leaders of two mercenary gangs. One had a claim of \u00a3439 (Rs. 4390) and until this was cleared the estate had, at a yearly cost of \u00a354 (Rs. 540), to keep him and his men. The other creditor claimed \u00a3511 (Rs. 5110) and failing payment was entitled to support at a yearly cost of \u00a352 (Rs. 520). Together the two charges came to \u00a3106 (Rs. 1060) on an estate whose whole yearly revenue was not more than \u00a3160 (Rs. 1600). To help to free him from debt this chief was, on the security of his land, granted a loan of \u00a353 (Rs. 830).\n\nThe Thakor of Kanjeri was indebted to three different leaders of mercenaries whose claims amounted to \u00a3790 (Rs. 7900), the cost of whose keep was \u00a3193 (Rs. 1930). He was granted a loan of \u00a3330 (Rs. 3300) on security of his lands.\n\nThe Thakor of Bhimaria, a mere boy without male relatives, was deeply in debt. One Jamadar had a claim upon him for \u00a3298 (Rs. 2980) for which he was entitled to receive in wages \u00a364 (Rs. 540) a year.\n\nThe Thakor of Mehlo, a man of extreme imbecility, was heavily in debt particularly to two leaders of mercenaries who kept him almost a prisoner in his own house. To one he owed \u00a3586 (Rs. 5860) and to the other \u00a350 (Rs. 500) and he was obliged to pay them in wages \u00a3142 (Rs. 1420) a year. Government took charge of the estate and guaranteed the repayment of the loan at 6 per cent interest.\n\nThe Zamindar of Tanda was indebted for loans of money and arrears of pay to the extent of \u00a3969 (Rs. 9690); he was bound to pay \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) a year to these men. On the security of his lands he was granted a loan of \u00a3303 (Rs. 3030.)\ndistrict. In Dohad other causes made the disorder more complete. A large number of the villages had been farmed to some families of Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s. In their exactions the farmers encroached on the private lands of some Rajputs, who finding no redress and, having one of their number ill-used by the Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s\u2019 mercenaries, went into outlawry, and capturing the Vanj\u00e1ra killed him. To avenge his death the Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s relations collected mercenary troops, and disorders were increased by the attacks of some village headmen who had joined the outlaws. So loud were the complaints that Sindi\u00e1\u2019s Government sent a special agent to quiet the country. The agent allowed the outlaws to return to their villages, but left without making any settlement with the Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s. They, intent on vengeance, raised fresh troops and seized two of the outlaws. At this time the management of the district was made over to the British. At first the Vanj\u00e1ra became more insubordinate. He refused to give up his prisoners or to disband his followers, and would neither pay revenue nor let it be collected. He attacked a Government post and rescued a thief from the custody of the police. On news of these disorders the Political Agent, with a special escort of fifty men, advanced to Godhra. And the Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s and other malcontents finding that the British Government had taken charge of the district, came in and except one Jam\u00e1d\u00e1r who absconded, and a few who refused to give security, submitted their disputes to be settled by the Political Agent. In their new agreements the larger land-holders engaged to employ no armed persons without the sanction of the Political Agent, and by making them advances on the security of their estates, help was given to those who would take it, to compound the Jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs\u2019 claims.\n\nWhen the management of the district was made over to the British, the chief revenue contractor recovered therevenue by several different systems of settlement. Except those in the hands of the larger land-holders, who paid a lump sum fixed by a guess at their probable revenue, most villages were represented by their headman who was made responsible for an amount fixed on a rough calculation of what the village could pay, and what it had before paid. Other villages were let in groups to sub-contractors on five-year leases, with yearly increasing rents. In other cases the division of crops and levy of a plough cess fixed by the district revenue superintendent or des\u00e1t, varied according to the caste of the cultivator from 4s. to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 2-Rs. 15) a plough, or, at the rate of seven acres (15 bigh\u00e1s) to a plough, a bigha rate of from 3d. to 2s. (2 annas-Re. 1). When spice, sugarcane, and other rich crops were grown, an extra cess was levied. In villages where a division of crops was in force the Government share varied from a third to a half.\n\nUnder British management the position of the large landlords, Th\u00e1kors and T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, has as far as possible been left unchanged. These proprietors are chiefly Kolis, locally known as Th\u00e1kors and T\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs. Their estates, varying in size from a share in one village\n\n---\n\n1 Pol. Agent to Gov. 21st Dec. 1853.\nto a group of forty or fifty villages, are pretty generally distributed over the whole of the Panch Mah\u0101ls, and are perhaps most numerous in the western sub-divisions. The steps taken in 1853 to free them from their bondage to the leaders of the mercenary troops were for the time successful. But their carelessness and want of thrift, together with their practice of dividing their lands equally amongst all the members of the family, have led to many of them falling into a state of much poverty. The only villages of this class into which any change has as yet been introduced, are twenty-three K\u0101l\u014dl mehw\u0101si villages, whose lands were surveyed and their Government rental fixed in 1873. In other parts of the district the rental paid at the introduction of British rule has been continued. The landlord\u2019s relations to his tenants have in no way been changed. There is no fixed system of recovering rents. The mode of realizing them, and the amount realized, differ not only in the various estates, but even in different villages in the same property. In one respect the practice would seem to be the same over the whole district, the proprietor never turns out his tenant.\n\nOne point that very early came to notice in the management of Government, kh\u0101lsa, villages was the very large area of alienated land. An inquiry made in 1853-54 showed that the possession of much of this land was supported by no regular title deeds, and, where deeds were produced, they showed that the land had been bought or taken in mortgage from people who had paid the Government assessment or were bound to perform certain services. The results of this inquiry were laid before His Highness Sindi\u0101\u2019s Government. But as they did not approve of such a course no steps were taken to resume illegal alienations. In 1865 claims to alienations were registered and classified. And in 1872 a set of rules was drawn up for the settlement of claims. These rules provided that lands alienated for religious or charitable purposes should be continued, either if their value was allowed for in the exchange of territory with Sindia, or if between 1853 and 1860, they were recognized as rentfree; that personal grants free from a stipulation of service should on payment of one-eighth of the full rental be continued, either if their value was allowed for in the exchange with Sindia, or if between 1853 and 1860 they were recognized as rentfree and registered in 1865; that unless the claim seemed entirely unfounded, lands registered in 1865 should be continued on payment of a quitrent of one quarter to one half of the survey assessment; that village officers\u2019 claims should be settled under the rules for village officers\u2019 emoluments; and that, unless one\n\n---\n\n1 As the holders refused the conditions offered by Government, the villages have been (1878) made kh\u0101lsa or Government.\n2 The following details show how much of the Panch Mah\u0101ls land is nominally alienated. In K\u0101l\u014dl (1856) a survey of 22 villages showed 29,206 bighas of rentpaying and 15,203 of quit or rentfree land (Major Wallace 71A., 12th September 1856); in Godhra (1860) of 52,127 bighas surveyed, 24,367 were quit or rentfree; the survey of the whole of K\u0101l\u014dl (1871) shows of 80,651 acres, 19,047 quit or rentfree, and the Godhra (1874) survey shows 25,389 out of 101,925.\n3 Major Buckle 811, 6th December 1860.\n4 Gov. Res. 4656, 19th September 1872.\nof them proved his right in a civil court, land claimed by several persons but not in the possession of any of them, should be fully assessed. Under these rules, since 1872, the alienations are being gradually settled.\n\nFor the collection of rents from Government lands, when the headman was unwilling to become responsible, an accountant was appointed and their rents recovered from the cultivators direct. In other respects the systems in force at the time of transfer were for some years continued unchanged. Between 1855 and 1858 some villages of Godhra and K\u00e1lol were roughly surveyed, and with the view of introducing a cash acre-rate, experienced headmen were brought from Kaira, and fields classified according to the quality of their soil, their position, and the caste of their cultivators. But the change was limited in Godhra to the town and five villages, and in K\u00e1lol to the town and fifteen villages.\n\nWhen, in 1861, they became a British district the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were thought too backward for the regular survey. Since then as tillage has spread and the district become more settled, the survey has been introduced, into K\u00e1lol in 1871 and into Godhra in 1874. Dohad has also been surveyed. But as the two last seasons have been unfavourable, the new rates have not yet been introduced. The result of the introduction of survey rates into K\u00e1lol was in the best dry crop lands a slight acre rise from 5s. 11\u00bdd. to 6s. (Rs. 2-15-7\u2014Rs. 3); in the best garden lands a fall from \u00a32 19s. 3\u00bdd. to 18s. (Rs. 29-10-4\u2014Rs. 9), and in the best rice lands a rise from 11s. 10\u00bdd. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 5-15-3\u2014Rs. 12). In Godhra all the rates were lowered; the best dry crop from 5s. 11\u00bdd. to 3s. 6d. (Rs. 2-15-5\u2014Rs. 1-12-0), the best garden from \u00a31 14s. 0\u00bdd. to 6s. (Rs. 17-0-3\u2014Rs. 3), and the best rice from 10s. 4\u00bdd. to 7s. 6d. (Rs. 5-3-1\u2014Rs. 3-12-0.) The financial result was in K\u00e1lol an increase from \u00a34603 16s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 46,038-4-6) to \u00a35484 2s. (Rs. 54,841) or 19 per cent, and in Godhra from \u00a33916 2s. (Rs. 39,161) to \u00a33927 9s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 39,274-15) or 0\u00b729 per cent. The following two statements give the chief details:\n\n**Panch Mah\u00e1ls Survey Rates, 1871-1873.**\n\n| Sub-Division | Dry-crop | Garden | Rice |\n|--------------|----------|--------|------|\n|              | Max.     | Min.   | Max. | Min. | Max. | Min. |\n| K\u00e1lol        | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. |\n|              | 2 15 7   | 1 1 10 | 29 10 4 | 5 3 4 | 5 15 3 | 2 3 8 |\n| Godhra       | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. |\n|              | 2 15 5   | 1 1 10 | 17 0 3 | 17 0 0 | 5 3 1 | 2 3 6 |\n\n| Present Acre Rates. |\n|---------------------|\n| K\u00e1lol               | 3 0 0 | 1 4 0 | 9 0 0 | 5 4 0 | 12 0 0 | 5 4 0 |\n| Godhra              | 1 12 0 | 0 8 0 | 3 0 0 | 0 8 0 | 3 12 0 | 1 0 0 |\nSince the district came under their control, one of the chief aims of British officers has been to attract settlers to the Panch Mahals waste lands. In 1862 the Political Agent was of opinion that, on account of the wild N\u0101lkda neighbourhood, and because of its unhealthy climate, there was little chance of getting strangers to settle in H\u00e1lo, and that K\u00e1lol in the west, and Dohad and Jhalod in the east, offered settlers inducement enough without any special help from Government. To Godhra, he thought, some effort should be made to attract colonists. Accordingly an agent on \u00a32 (Rs. 20) a month was for one year employed to collect colonists,\u00b9 and small settlers, on their promise to build good houses and not leave the district for ten years, were offered timber and land rentfree for two years, the rent rising to one-quarter in the third, one-half in the fifth, three-quarters in the seventh, and full rates in the ninth year.\n\nA settler able to found a village was, if he wished it, to be made headman, and for every ten acres (twenty bigh\u00e1s) brought under tillage, was to receive one acre rentfree.\u00b2 In 1864 lands were offered at 1s. a bigh\u00e1 with, if they were covered with brushwood, remission for one year, and to encourage new villages, Government promised to help the founders by granting timber and by sinking a well. These terms failed to tempt colonists, and in 1866 to small settlers land was offered rentfree for three years and then for four more at half the regular assessment.\u00b3 In addition to these concessions, large settlers were, for every twenty bigh\u00e1s brought under tillage within seven years,\u2074 offered the gift of one bigh\u00e1 of rentfree land. Under these terms in the three following years a considerable number of settlers took up land.\u2075 But they were all poor men, chiefly Bhils and Kolis. As yet the offer was not tempting enough to overcome the dislike of Kanbis of position and capital to leave Kaira for the wild and unhealthy Mahals. A new set of rules was accordingly drawn up\u2076 in 1870. With some slight changes they are still in force. These rules provide:\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Res. 1758, 2nd May 1862.\n\u00b2 Bom. Gov. Res. 1758, 2nd May 1862.\n\u00b3 Bom. Gov. Res. 1891, 23rd May 1866.\n\u2074 Bom. Gov. Res. 2065, 21st May 1869.\n\u2075 Leases were given under the rules of 1866 for colonizing several deserted villages such as Chandan, Isarvadi, Chabanpur, and Salisamli in the Godhra subdivision.\n\u2076 Bom. Gov. Resolutions Nos. 5834, 26th November 1870; 3784, 3rd July 1873, and 4641, 17th August 1875.\nThat colonists bringing large bodies of settlers should receive from 50 to 5000 acres of land; that they should hold it rent-free for five years, and then pay 6d. (4 as.) an acre till the tenth year, then 1s. 6d. (12 as.), or if less, the survey rate, till the twenty-fifth year when the land would be re-assessed; that every fifth year an additional fourth of the whole area should be brought under tillage, and that security should be furnished. Grants of rentfree land were also promised, the trees were with few exceptions handed over to the settler, and provision made for Government aid in building village offices and wells.\n\nSmall settlers were at the same time offered grants of land up to fifty acres rentfree for five years.\n\nThough even these inducements have not been enough to bring any large number of the better class of settlers into the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, steady but slow progress has been made. An account has already been given (page 227) of the arrival in 1877 of a large body of colonists to settle in the rich lands near P\u00e1v\u00e1gad. This, in spite of very great difficulties, has to some extent proved a success and has cleared of forest and brushwood a large tract of rich land. The opening of the railway to P\u00e1li has greatly lessened the distance between the western parts of the district and central Gujar\u00e1t, and with more prosperous seasons than the two last, a steadily increasing number of colonists may be looked for.\n\nAttention was early directed to the question of transit duties. Under His Highness Sindi\u00e1\u2019s management the customs of each subdivision were separately farmed. In different parts of the district the same goods were charged different rates. Merchandize passing by one route paid more than by another. Some classes of carriers were charged the full amount, while others were so favoured as to have practically a monopoly. Between 1855 and 1858 the duties were lowered and the mode of collecting them simplified. Instead of being annoyed by constant petty demands, the trader might, with one payment, pass through the whole of Panch Mah\u00e1ls and B\u00e1riya territory. Town dues were abolished, grain and salt freed, and many petty taxes repealed. Under the new system traffic increased so greatly that, in spite of the lower rates, the revenue rose from \u00a33632 (Rs. 36,320) in 1858 to \u00a37819 (Rs. 78,190) in 1861.\n\nWith this large revenue as a local fund, roadmaking was rapidly pressed on. But under the orders of Government with the\n\n---\n\n1 Colonists taking 500 acres were allowed a personal grant of twenty acres; those taking from 500 to 700 acres, thirty acres; those from 700 to 900 acres, forty acres; those from 900 to 1000 acres, fifty acres, and 5 more for every additional 100 acres. This grant was to be first made ten years after the land was taken up, and would be in proportion to the land brought under tillage. Further grants were promised in the same manner at the close of the fifteenth and twentieth years.\n\n2 Among those repealed were cesses on braziers, butchers, carpenters, on the sale of molasses, on marriages, on foreign traders, on brokers, on brickmakers, on empty carts and unladen bullocks, on raw cotton and on vegetable sellers. Major Wallace, 71 A., 12th September 1856.\n\n3 The details are, opium Rs. 10,377, timber Rs. 16,183, and other articles Rs. 51,630; total Rs. 78,190.\nintroduction of the revenue survey the levy of transit dues ceases and the ordinary local fund cess takes its place. This change has for the present caused a great loss of revenue.\n\nThe following are the chief details of the fourteen years ending 1877:\n\nIn 1864 the rainfall, twenty-five inches, was scanty, beginning late and ending early. Rice failed almost entirely and maize partially. The district suffered from cholera. The revenue for collection amounted to \u00a322,125 (Rs. 2,21,250) and remissions to \u00a3789 (Rs. 7890). The outstanding balance at the end of 31st July 1865 was \u00a31654 (Rs. 16,540). Millet rupee prices rose from twenty-six to sixteen pounds.\n\nIn 1865 the rainfall, twenty-five inches, was unseasonable and scanty. But except rice, the crops were fair. Cholera of a fatal type was common. Tillage spread and the land revenue rose from \u00a322,125 to \u00a322,996 (Rs. 2,21,250 - Rs. 2,29,960). \u00a324 (Rs. 240) were remitted and \u00a31713 (Rs. 17,130) left (31st July 1866) outstanding. Millet rupee prices fell from sixteen to twenty pounds.\n\nIn 1866 the rainfall, thirty inches, though too soon over was sufficient. The crops were good, and there was no epidemic disease. The land revenue rose from \u00a322,996 to \u00a323,457 (Rs. 2,29,960 - Rs. 2,34,570). \u00a330 (Rs. 300) were remitted and \u00a3266 (Rs. 2660) left (31st July 1867) outstanding. Millet rupee prices fell from twenty to thirty-one pounds.\n\nIn 1867 the rainfall, twenty-nine inches, was heavy especially in the west. The crops and public health were good. The land revenue \u00a323,458 (Rs. 2,34,580) was recovered without remissions or outstandings. Millet rupee prices rose from thirty-one to twenty-five pounds.\n\nIn 1868 the rainfall, thirty-five inches, began very early especially in the west and was at first very heavy. But the late rains failed and rice, millet, and some other grains were not more than half crops. Public health was good. The revenue rose from \u00a323,458 to \u00a324,767 (Rs. 2,34,580 - Rs. 2,47,670). \u00a391 (Rs. 910) were remitted and \u00a319 (Rs. 190) left (31st July 1869) outstanding. Millet rupee prices fell from twenty-five to twenty-eight pounds.\n\nIn 1869 the rainfall, forty-three inches, though heavy was unseasonable. Except millet and maize the crops were good. In the hot months there was a bad outbreak of cholera. Land revenue rose from \u00a324,767 to \u00a326,636 (Rs. 2,47,670 - Rs. 2,66,360). \u00a393 (Rs. 930) were remitted and \u00a3415 (Rs. 4150) left (31st July 1870) outstanding. Millet rupee prices rose from twenty-eight to twenty-two pounds.\n\nIn 1870 the rainfall, forty-one inches, was unseasonable, millet and maize yielding not more than half crops. Of \u00a326,192 (Rs. 2,61,920)\n\n---\n\n1 Millet is bajri, Penicillaria spicata.\nthe land revenue for collection, \u00a3161 (Rs. 1610) remained outstanding at the end of the year. Millet rupee prices fell from twenty-two to twenty-six pounds.\n\nIn 1871 the rainfall, forty inches, was capricious. In the west it did not begin till the close of July, and throughout the district was too soon over. Except maize all the crops suffered. Public health was good. Of \u00a327,043 (Rs. 2,70,430) the land revenue for collection, \u00a311 (Rs. 110) were remitted and \u00a3470 (Rs. 4700) left (31st July 1872) outstanding. Millet rupee prices fell from twenty-six to twenty-seven pounds.\n\nIn 1872 the rainfall, thirty-five inches, was seasonable and sufficient. Of \u00a326,523 (Rs. 2,65,230) the land revenue for collection, \u00a394 (Rs. 940) were remitted and \u00a3214 (Rs. 2140) left (31st July 1873) outstanding. Millet rupee prices fell from twenty-seven to thirty-two pounds.\n\nIn 1873 the rainfall, twenty-eight inches, at first favourable was too soon over and the crops, especially rice, suffered. Public health was good. Of \u00a325,715 (Rs. 2,57,150) the land revenue for collection, \u00a32671 (Rs. 26,710) were left (31st July 1874) outstanding. Millet rupee prices fell from thirty-two to forty pounds.\n\nIn 1874 the rainfall, thirty-six inches, began rather late but afterwards was seasonable and sufficient with a good harvest, especially of rice. Public health was good. Of \u00a326,109 (Rs. 2,61,090) the land revenue for collection, \u00a3197 (Rs. 1970) were remitted and \u00a356 (Rs. 560) left (31st July 1875) outstanding. Millet rupee prices fell from forty to forty-eight pounds.\n\nIn 1875 the rainfall, thirty-eight inches, was seasonable and favourable. The crops were excellent and public health good. Of \u00a326,497 (Rs. 2,64,970) the land revenue for collection, \u00a348 (Rs. 480) were remitted and \u00a382 (Rs. 820) left (31st July 1876) outstanding. Millet rupee prices fell from forty-eight to fifty-four pounds.\n\nIn 1876 the rainfall, forty-four inches, was very heavy. The harvest was fair and public health good. Of \u00a326,924 (Rs. 2,69,240) the land revenue for collection, \u00a334 (Rs. 340) were remitted and \u00a319 (Rs. 190) left (31st July 1877) outstanding. Millet rupee prices rose from fifty-four to forty-six pounds.\n\nIn 1877 the rainfall, nineteen inches, was short and unseasonable. Public health was good. But the scarcity was so severely felt among the poorer classes that towards the end of the season relief camps had to be opened. The rain harvest was scanty and the cold weather crops almost entirely failed. Of \u00a326,052 (Rs. 2,60,520) the land revenue for collection, \u00a327 (Rs. 270) were remitted and \u00a34609 (Rs. 46,090) left (31st July 1878) outstanding. Millet rupee prices rose from forty-six to thirty-six pounds.\n\nDuring the twenty-two years ending 1877 population has increased from 143,595 in 1855 to 240,743 in 1872, or an advance of 67\u00b765\nper cent; cattle from 173,859 in 1857, to 254,262 in 1877, or 46\u00b724 per cent; ploughs from 18,303 in 1857, to 37,141 in 1877, or 102\u00b792 per cent; and carts from 6129 in 1857, to 8349 in 1877, or 36\u00b722 per cent. The land revenue has risen from \u00a321,410 (Rs. 2,14,100) in 1864 to \u00a326,025 (Rs. 2,60,250) in 1878, or 21\u00b755 per cent. Since 1864 two municipalities, one dispensary and twenty-nine schools have been established and 170 miles of road have been opened.\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJUSTICE.\n\nIn Sindia's time the settlement of civil disputes and the punishment of crime, were in the hands of the farmers of revenue, or of the Agent sent from Gwalior. At the introduction of British rule, under the Political Superintendent and his assistant, m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs settled civil suits. The police was in the hands of an officer, amald\u00e1r, who in big matters reported straight to the Political Superintendent and had power to imprison for fifteen days. The police amald\u00e1r was under the general control of a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r who could imprison for one month and fine up to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25.) The assistant superintendent could give twelve stripes, imprison for six months, and fine up to \u00a310 (Rs. 100). Heavier cases went to the Superintendent. From time to time steps were taken to introduce the British system, and at present the working of the courts is guided by the criminal and civil laws in force in other British districts.\n\nFor the disposal of civil suits there are at present two subordinate judges, styled muns\u00edfs, one at Godhra and one at Dohad. The Godhra muns\u00edf tries all Godhra, K\u00e1lol, and H\u00e1lol suits, and the Dohad muns\u00edf those of Dohad and Jh\u00e1lod. Appeals from their decisions lie to the court of the Governor's Agent, and are by him generally transferred to his covenanted assistant who has power to hear them and whose decisions are subject to an appeal to Government.\n\nFor the disposal of criminal cases there are officers of three grades: the Agent to the Governor; the first class magistrates, and the subordinate magistrates. The Agent has the powers of a Sessions Judge, sentences of death being submitted for the confirmation of Government. The covenanted assistant has the powers of an assistant sessions judge. Other first class magistrates and the subordinate magistrates have the powers ordinarily vested in officers of those grades. The criminal codes and laws have not been introduced into the district, but all inquiries are conducted in their spirit; punishments are inflicted under the provisions of the Penal Code, and all laws extended to the whole of British India are held to apply to the Panch Mah\u00e1ls.\n\nIn 1854 the district was furnished with seven judges, who decided 375 suits.\u00b9 Six years later (1860) the number of courts remained the\n\n\u00b9 The number and value of the suits disposed of between 1855 and 1860 are, in 1855, 568 valued at \u00a32433; in 1856, 663 valued at \u00a32515; in 1857, 885 valued at \u00a35020; in 1858, 967 valued at \u00a35066; in 1859, 1022 valued at \u00a33213; and in 1860, 1348 valued at \u00a34959. The average value of the suits decided during the eight years ending 1877 was, except in 1876, on the increase, the figures ranging between \u00a35 14s. 9d. (Rs. 57-6) in 1870 and \u00a36 16s. 9d. (Rs. 68-6) in 1877.\nsame, while the number of suits rose to 1348. In 1870 the number of courts was reduced to four, while the number of suits rose to 1758. In 1877 there were four courts and 1353 decisions. Of the four courts, two, those of the Agent and of his assistant, exercise appellate powers and try suits of more than \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000).\n\nEach of the two munsif's courts has an average area of 797 square miles and a population of 120,371 souls. The average distance of the Godhra court from the six most distant villages of its jurisdiction is thirty miles, and that of the Dohad court nineteen. The average number of cases decided during the eight years ending 1877 was 1706; the highest was 1854 in 1873 and the lowest 1353 in 1877.\n\nOf the total number of cases decided during the eight years ending 1877, 33\u00b729 per cent have on an average been given against the defendant in his absence. The proportion of cases decided in this way would seem to have, during the same period, varied between 37\u00b726 in 1872 and 29\u00b768 in 1876. Of contested cases only 19\u00b735 percent have, during the eight years ending 1877, been on an average decided for the defendant. With the exception of 1870 and 1871 when it was 25\u00b735 and 22\u00b780 per cent respectively, the proportion of cases decided in favour of the defendant varied during the same period of eight years, between 10\u00b715 per cent in 1872 and 21\u00b752 per cent in 1876. In only four cases, or 0\u00b729 per cent of the whole number of suits decided in 1877, was the decree executed by putting the plaintiff in the possession of the immovable property claimed. Except in 1876, when it was twenty-four, the number of cases of this kind during the eight years ending 1877 varied from two in 1872 to nine in 1874. In 12\u00b704 per cent of the decisions passed in 1877, decrees for money due were executed by the attachment or sale of property; of these 5\u00b754 per cent were, on an average, by the attachment or sale of movable and 6\u00b750 per cent of immovable property. Compared with 1870, the 1877 returns of attachments or sales of movable and immovable property show a rise from thirty-one to seventy-five in the former and from thirty-five to eighty-eight in the latter.\n\nCompared with 1870, the number of decrees executed by the arrest of the debtor has fallen from 303 in 1870 to 130 in 1877. The number of civil prisoners has, except in 1872 and 1876 when it was sixty-three and 215 respectively, risen from ninety-six in 1870 to 130 in 1877:\n\n| Year | Suits | Decreed Ex-parte | Percentage

Except the sub-registrar of Godhra who is special, these officers are the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs' or mah\u00e1lkars' head clerks. Besides that of the First Assistant Collector as district registrar and of his assistant or deputy, a special scrutiny is, under the control of the Inspector General of registration and stamps, carried on by the Gujar\u00e1t registration inspector. The registration returns for 1877-78 show receipts of \u00a3125 (Rs. 1250) and charges of \u00a3160 (Rs. 1600), or a loss of \u00a335 (Rs. 350). Of 444 the total number of registrations four were wills, six were papers affecting movable and 434 affecting immovable property. Of the last class, besides sixty-three miscellaneous instruments, six were deeds of gift, 218 were deeds of sale and 147 were mortgages. The registered value of the total immovable property transferred was \u00a315,876 (Rs. 1,58,760).\nAt present (1878) ten officers share the administration of criminal justice. Of these three are magistrates of the first class, and seven of the second and third classes. Of the former two are covenanted European civilians and one an uncovenanted Native. With regard to the local jurisdiction and powers of those magistrates, one of them, the Agent to the Governor, is placed in a special position, vested with the general supervision of the district. Each of the other two first class magistrates has an average charge of 797 square miles and a population of 120,371 souls. In the year 1876 the three first class magistrates decided 179 original and ninety-six appeal cases. These officers have as First Assistant Collector, and his assistant and deputy, revenue charge of the parts of the district over which they exercise magisterial powers. Of subordinate magistrates there are seven with an average charge of 228 square miles and a population of 34,391 souls. All are Natives. The total number of criminal cases decided by them in 1876 was 678. Besides their magisterial duties, five of these officers exercise revenue powers as m\u00e1latd\u00e1rs and mah\u00e1lkaris and one is a sub-registrar of assurances. There are at present no regular village police; the matter is now under the consideration of Government.\n\nThe table of offences given below shows that during the seven years ending 1877, 983 offences or one offence for every 244 of the population were on an average committed. Of these there were on an average six murders and attempts to murder; three culpable homicides; nineteen cases of grievous hurt and hurt by dangerous weapons; eighteen cases of dacoity and robbery; 936 or 95 per cent of the whole were minor offences.\n\nAt the time of the transfer of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls (1853) there were many gang robberies and murders committed by large bands of Bhils belonging to different states and almost impossible to catch. At first the number of offences reported was small. But gradually instead of taking the law into their own hands, the people began to seek police help, and in spite of greater efficiency the number of recorded crimes steadily increased from 496 in 1854 to 1186 in 1860. The chief cause of the failure to put down crime was the ease with which bands of unsettled Bhils and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s could come, and carrying off cattle, pass out of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. Once over the borders the robbers were safe, for there were no arrangements for recovering criminals from the neighbouring states. An attempt was made to supply this want by the occasional meeting of the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Political Agent and an assistant of the Meyw\u00e1r Political Agent. But this system, never satisfactory, was given up in 1864 and since 1872 the recovery of offenders has been secured under the Extradition Act (XI. of 1872).\n\nUnder the management of His Highness Sindia, there was no regular police force. For the maintenance of order the district\n\n---\n\n1 Major Wallace 145, 13th May 1856.\n2 The total number of offences was 496 in 1854; 839 in 1855; 1009 in 1856; 980 in 1857; 883 in 1858; 1031 in 1859; and 1186 in 1860.\nwas divided among officers styled *jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs*, each of whom was paid a lump sum from the Gw\u00e1lior treasury and was expected to keep a certain number of armed men, distributed over his share of the district. There was also a detachment of mounted militia, *siband\u00ed*. After the transfer of the district, on account of disorders and of the unruly character of so many of the people, it was thought advisable to raise an armed force of Bhils. With the Kh\u00e1ndesh force as its model the Panch Mah\u00e1ls Bhil corps had in 1858, exclusive of establishment, a sanctioned strength of ten *subhed\u00e1rs*, ten *jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs*, fifty *hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs*, fifty *n\u00e1iks*, one bugle major, ten buglers, and 800 privates, total 931. Its head quarters were fixed at Dohad, where lines for 600 men were built. The Bhil corps was a success. In 1860, though in H\u00e1lol and K\u00e1lol on the west cattle-lifting was still a common offence, in Dohad and Jh\u00e1lod, where they had formerly been most rife, offences of this class had nearly ceased.\u00b9 In 1861 it was found most useful in forest fighting and wonderfully cheap and effective for outpost duty.\u00b2 In 1867, as the district was much more settled, the sanctioned strength of the corps was reduced from 931 to 429 men. But in the next year, with its reduced strength, the corps was unable to put down the N\u00e1ikda rising, and its numbers were raised to their present total of 500 men. At present (1877) two-thirds of the corps are Bhils and Kol\u00eds and the rest Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Pardesis. The discipline is semi-military and the men are in appearance well drilled and soldier-like. The uniform is a forage cap with bugle ornament, a dark blue tunic with red facings, and brown, *kh\u00e1rk\u00e1*, coloured pantaloons. They are armed with Saffer\u2019s carbines and sword bayonets. Almost half the corps is employed on outpost duty. They guard m\u00e1ml\u00e1t\u00e1rs\u2019 and mah\u00e1lkaris\u2019 offices, furnish escorts to district officers, and are scattered in a number of small posts, *th\u00e1n\u00e1s*, in different parts of the district.\n\nIn the year 1877 the total strength of the district or regular police force was, including the Bhil corps, 824. Of these, under the district and assistant district Superintendents of police, two were subordinate officers, 111 inferior subordinate officers, thirty-six mounted police, and 673 constables. Besides these, a force of six officers and thirty constables was employed as an escort to the Political Agent, Rewa K\u00e1ntha. The cost of maintaining the entire district police force was as follows: The two European officers, the Superintendent and assistant superintendent received a total yearly salary of \u00a3993 (Rs. 9930); the subordinate officers a yearly salary of not less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) each, and the inferior subordinate officers a yearly salary of less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) each, or a total yearly cost of \u00a32652 4s. (Rs. 26,522); the pay of the mounted police and of the foot constables came to a total sum of\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Pol. Agent 811, 6th December 1860.\n\u00b2 Pol. Agent 212, 30th April 1861.\n\u00b3 The details are: 3 *subhed\u00e1rs*, 6 *jam\u00e1d\u00e1rs*, 18 *hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs*, 36 *nd\u00edks*, and 437 privates. Besides these, 36 men employed under the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Political Agent, form part of the Bhil corps.\n\u00a37164 6s. (Rs. 71,643). Besides the pay of the officers and men, there was a total yearly sum of \u00a3497 14s. (Rs. 4977) allowed for the horses and travelling expenses of the superior officers; \u00a3300 2s. (Rs. 3001) yearly pay and travelling allowance for their establishments, and \u00a3554 16s. (Rs. 5548) a year for contingencies and other expenses, making a total yearly cost of \u00a312,162 2s. (Rs. 1,21,621).\u00b9\n\nTaking 1595 square miles as the area of the district and 240,743 as its population, the strength of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls\u2019 police is one man to every 0\u00b751 square miles and 292 souls. The cost of maintenance is equal to \u00a37 12s. 6d. (Rs. 76-4-0) a square mile, or nearly 1s. (8 as.) a head of the population.\n\nExclusive of the Superintendent, the assistant superintendent, and the force of thirty-six policemen under the Political Agent Rewa K\u00e1ntha, of the total strength of 822 police, 166, of whom twenty-one were officers and 145 constables, were in 1877 employed as guards at district, central, or subsidiary jails; 140, of whom fourteen were officers and 126 constables, were engaged as guards over lock-ups and treasuries, or as escorts to prisoners and treasure; 486, of whom seventy-four were officers and 412 constables, were engaged on other duties; and thirty, of whom four were officers and twenty-six constables, were stationed in towns and municipalities. Of the whole number of 822, exclusive of the Superintendent and assistant superintendent of police, 566 were provided with fire-arms, and 256 with swords only, or with swords and batons; 196, of whom sixty-four were officers and 132 constables, could read and write; and 199, of whom twelve were officers and 187 constables, were under instruction. Except the two superior officers who were Europeans, the members of the police force for whom details were available were all natives of India. Of these, twenty-six officers and 186 constables were Musalm\u00e1ns; one officer was a P\u00e1rsi; ten officers and fifty-five constables were Br\u00e1hmans; five officers and thirty constables were Rajputs; forty officers and eighty-one constables were Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; seventeen officers and 250 constables were Bhils; three officers and forty-seven constables were Kol\u00eds; and ten officers and fifty-three constables were Hindus of other castes. There were six vacancies and for the thirty-six men employed in the Rewa K\u00e1ntha, the information was not given.\n\nIn 1877 of 119 persons accused of heinous crimes, eighty-one or 68\u00b706 per cent were convicted. Of 2039 the total number of persons accused of crimes of all sorts, 1572 or 77\u00b709 per cent were convicted. In the matter of the recovery of stolen property, of \u00a31781 2s. (Rs. 17,811) alleged to have been stolen, \u00a3727 8s. (Rs. 7274) or 40\u00b78 per cent were recovered.\n\nThe following table gives the chief crimes and police details of the seven years ending 1877:\n\n\u00b9 Of this sum \u00a3385 (Rs. 3850) on account of the police employed under the Political Agent, Rewa K\u00e1ntha, were paid from local funds.\n### Chapter IX.\n\n#### Justice.\n\n**Crime and Police, 1871-1877.**\n\n| Year | Murder and attempt to Murder | Culpable Homicide | Grievous hurt and hurt by dangerous weapons | Dacoities and Robberies |\n|------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|      | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage |\n| 1871 | 4      | 5       | 2           | 40        | ...    | ...     | ...         | ...        | 23     | 38      | 4          | 10\u00bd      | 13      | 30       | 11         | 36\u00b76     |\n| 1872 | 5      | 5       | 5           | 100       | 6      | 14      | 4          | 28\u00b75       | 15      | 30      | 21         | 70       | 14      | 17       | 15         | 88\u00b72     |\n| 1873 | 7      | 15      | 4           | 26\u00b75      | 5      | 6       | 2          | 33\u00b73       | 19      | 37      | 11         | 29\u00b77     | 19      | 26       | 6          | 24       |\n| 1874 | 4      | 6       | 1           | 16\u00b76      | 6      | 8       | 3          | 37\u00b75       | 19      | 24      | 18         | 75       | 20      | 86       | 10         | 27\u00b77     |\n| 1875 | 7      | 8       | 3           | 37\u00b75      | 4      | 8       | 2          | 25         | 22      | 42      | 12         | 26\u00b71     | 12      | 12       | 7          | 58\u00b73     |\n| 1876 | 5      | 20      | 12          | 60        | ...    | ...     | ...         | ...        | 14      | 19      | 12         | 61\u00b71     | 15      | 28       | 15         | 53\u00b75     |\n| 1877 | 7      | 25      | 16          | 60        | 4      | 7       | 0          | 86\u00b77       | 24      | 32      | 19         | 69\u00b73     | 35      | 41       | 14\u00b75       |\n\n**Offences and Punishments\u2014continued.**\n\n| Year | Other Offences | Total | Stolen Property |\n|------|----------------|-------|-----------------|\n|      | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Number | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Property stolen | Property recovered | Percentage |\n| 1871 | 802   | 1229    | 705        | 53\u00b704      | 842    | 1402    | 722        | 51\u00b74       | \u00a3 1388         | \u00a3 767              | 10      | 55\u00b72     |\n| 1872 | 765   | 1227    | 559        | 53\u00b77       | 600    | 1283    | 704        | 54\u00b74       | 2361          | 1073              | 6       | 45\u00b74     |\n| 1873 | 744   | 1305    | 705        | 54\u00b702      | 797    | 1388    | 728        | 52\u00b74       | 1377          | 599                | 18      | 43\u00b75     |\n| 1874 | 666   | 1256    | 568        | 44\u00b79       | 915    | 1535    | 686        | 44\u00b76       | 1720          | 545                | 16      | 31\u00b70     |\n| 1875 | 932   | 1401    | 102        | 70\u00b76       | 1471   | 2322    | 722        | 30\u00b77       | 1724          | 545                | 12      | 34\u00b74     |\n| 1876 | 937   | 1458    | 931        | 54\u00b71       | 974    | 1519    | 970        | 63\u00b78       | 1226          | 549                | 2       | 43\u00b77     |\n| 1877 | 1486  | 1920    | 1491       | 77\u00b76       | 1547   | 2039    | 1572       | 77\u00b709      | 1791          | 737                | 2       | 40\u00b78     |\n\nBesides the accommodation provided for under-trial prisoners at the head-quarters of each sub-division, there is in the town of Dohad a district jail able to hold 105 male and nine female prisoners.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nREVENUE AND FINANCE.\n\nThe gross revenue in 1852 amounted to \u00a320,113 (Rs. 2,01,130). Of this \u00a311,378 (Rs. 1,13,780) were spent on the management of the district, and \u00a38735 (Rs. 87,350) were paid over to His Highness Sindia. The revenue for 1853 amounted to \u00a321,313 (Rs. 2,13,130), and the expenditure to \u00a37407 (Rs. 74,070), leaving a surplus of \u00a313,906 (Rs. 1,39,060). According to the estimate sent from Gwalior to the Rewa Kantha Political Agent on the transfer of the district, His Highness Sindia expected to receive \u00a313,028 (Rs. 1,30,280) for 1854, and \u00a313,764 (Rs. 1,37,640) for 1855, and for each succeeding year. The revenue for 1855 was estimated at \u00a322,665 (Rs. 2,26,650) and the cost at \u00a38901 (Rs. 89,010) leaving a surplus of \u00a313,764 (Rs. 1,37,640). During the seven years ending 1859 the British management resulted in the steady increase of revenue shown in the margin. The total amount remitted to His Highness Sindia during those seven years (1853-1859) was \u00a395,613 (Rs. 9,56,130) or a yearly average of \u00a313,659 (Rs. 1,36,590). At the end of the year ending June 1860 there was a balance of \u00a313,379 (Rs. 1,33,790) in favour of His Highness Sindia. This, added to the remittance, raises the total to \u00a3108,992 (Rs. 10,89,920) or a yearly average of \u00a315,570 (Rs. 1,55,700), or \u00a31806 (Rs. 18,060) more than the estimate. This increased surplus, in spite of an addition from \u00a38021 (Rs. 80,210) in 1853-54 to \u00a316,657 (Rs. 1,66,570) in 1859-60 in the cost of administration, is a satisfactory proof of the success of the early English management.\n\nThe earliest year for which complete figures are available is 1863-64. A comparison of specially prepared balance sheets for 1863-64 and 1875-76 shows the following changes. Exclusive of \u00a36662 (Rs. 66,620) the adjustment on account of alienated land, the transactions that appear in the district balance sheet for 1875-76 amount to receipts \u00a346,232 (Rs. 4,62,320) against \u00a335,281 (Rs. 3,52,810) in 1863-64, and the charges to \u00a337,656 (Rs. 3,76,560) in 1875-76 against \u00a327,829 (Rs. 2,78,290) in 1863-64. Exclusive of departmental miscellaneous receipts and sums received in return for\n\n| Year | Realized | Outstanding |\n|------|----------|-------------|\n| 1853-54 | 23,565 | ... |\n| 1854-55 | 26,286 | 6191 |\n| 1855-56 | 25,900 | 5036 |\n| 1856-57 | 26,702 | 4807 |\n| 1857-58 | 27,135 | 4863 |\n| 1858-59 | 28,482 | 4334 |\n| 1859-60 | 29,277 | 2459 |\n\nBalance Sheet, 1864-1876.\nservices rendered, such as the receipts of the post department, the amount of revenue raised in 1875-76 under all heads, Imperial, provincial, local, and municipal, amounted to \u00a341,633 (Rs. 4,16,330), or on a population of 240,743 an incidence per head of 3s. 5\u00bdd.\n\nLand revenue receipts forming 62\u00b759 per cent of \u00a341,633 (Rs. 4,16,330), the entire revenue of the district, have risen from \u00a321,411 (Rs. 2,14,110) in the year ending 31st July 1864, to \u00a326,025 (Rs. 2,60,250) in 1878. Details of the land revenue collected during the last fifteen years are given in the margin. The rise in the land revenue in the seven years ending 1870 was due chiefly to the spread of the tillage area, and the better state of the people. Except 1865 when on account of scarcity caused by scanty rainfall remissions amounting to \u00a3789 (Rs. 7890) had to be given, these were years of progress. The increase and large remissions in 1871 and 1874 are nominal owing to the introduction of revised rates of assessment in K\u00e1lol and Godhra, as the difference between the old and new rates in the first year of settlement has, according to the survey rules, to be remitted. Since then in 1875 and 1876 the revenue steadily increased, but the failure of crops and distress in 1877, have in 1878 brought the revenue lower than it has been since 1870. The increased cost in collecting the land revenue from \u00a33677 (Rs. 36,770) in 1863-64, to \u00a39848 (Rs. 98,480) in 1875-76, is due to a rise in the number and in the amount of revenue officers' salaries.\n\nStamps have risen from \u00a31101 to \u00a32625 (Rs. 11,010 - Rs. 26,250). The 1876 charges were \u00a364 (Rs. 640) or only \u00a34 (Rs. 40) more than those of 1864.\n\nFrom the fondness of its wild tribes for liquor the Panch Mah\u00e1ls' excise receipts are considerable; since 1863 they have risen from \u00a31201 to \u00a32089 (Rs. 12,010 - Rs. 20,890).\n\nLaw and justice receipts, chiefly fines, have risen from \u00a3441 to \u00a3565 (Rs. 4410 - Rs. 5650). The 1876 charges were \u00a33561 (Rs. 35,610) against \u00a31436 (Rs. 14,360) in 1864 on account of the improved agency employed.\n\nForest is a new head since 1863.

The regular local fund cess, of one-sixteenth in addition to the ordinary land-tax, levied in other British districts has been introduced into the sub-divisions of K\u00e1lol and Godhra, in the former from 1871-72, and in the latter from 1875-76. Under the orders of Government transit duties are abolished on the introduction of revised rates of assessment, and the levy of the regular one-anna cess is introduced. This measure has caused a great loss to the district local funds revenue, as the transit duties greatly exceeded the amount of the one anna cess. The 1877-78 receipts were \u00a36532 (Rs. 65,320) against \u00a39300 (Rs. 93,000) in 1863-64 when the transit duties were levied throughout the district.\n\nFor administrative purposes the local funds of the district are divided into two main sections, one set apart for public works and the other for instruction. The receipts and disbursements during the year 1877-78 under those two heads were as follows:\n\nPanch Mahals Local Funds, 1877-78.\n\nPUBLIC WORKS.\n\n| RECEIPTS | EXPENDITURE |\n|----------|-------------|\n| \u00a3. s.    | \u00a3. s.       |\n| Balance, 1st April 1877 | 4693 4 | Establishments | 1088 3 |\n| Two-thirds of the land cess | 691 8 | New works | 3824 4 |\n| Cess other than the one-anna cess and transit duties | 1596 15 | Repairs | 1205 7 |\n| Tolls | 2352 4 | Medical charges | 206 18 |\n| Ferries | | Miscellaneous | 304 5 |\n| Cattle pounds | 151 5 | Balance, 1st April 1878 | 3229 17 |\n| Travellers' rest-houses | | Total | 9838 14 |\n| Contributions | 269 5 | |\n| Miscellaneous | 84 13 | |\n\nINSTRUCTION.\n\n| \u00a3. s. | \u00a3. s. |\n|-------|-------|\n| Balance, 1st April 1877 | 244 14 | School charge | 1130 16 |\n| One-third of the cess allotment from transit duties | 495 14 | Scholarships | 30 12 |\n| School fee fund | 118 4 | School-houses, new | 21 18 |\n| Contribution (Government) | 714 12 | Do. repairs | 29 12 |\n| Do.

To help village instruction 12 schools, and for the comfort of travellers 7 rest-houses have been built. Besides these works, 29 village offices, chor\u00e1s, 41 cattle-pounds, and one dispensary have been constructed.\n\nIn 1876-77 two town municipalities were established.

Of this \u00a3715 (Rs. 7150) were debited to Government and \u00a3504 (Rs. 5040) to local and other funds.\n\nUnder the Director of public instruction and the inspector, northern division, the schooling of the district was conducted by a local staff sixty-one strong; of these one was an assistant deputy inspector with general charge over all the schools of the district, drawing a yearly pay of \u00a3125 (Rs. 1250); and the rest were masters and assistant masters of schools with yearly salaries ranging from 12s. to \u00a348 (Rs. 6 - Rs. 480).\n\nOf thirty-six the total number of Government schools, in thirty-five Gujarati only was taught, and in one Urdu and Gujarati.\n\nThe following figures show the increased means for learning to read and write, offered by Government during the last twenty-four years. The first school opened in this district was a Gujarati school at Godhra in 1854. Two years later, an Anglo-veracular school\u00b9 was opened in the same town. No detailed information is available for any year before 1855. In 1855-56 there were seven schools in the district with an average attendance of 362 pupils or 0\u00b727 per cent of the total population of not more than twenty years of age. In 1865-66 the number of schools had risen to twenty-four, with a roll-call of 1863 names, and an average attendance of 1162 pupils or 0\u00b787 per cent of the total population of not more than twenty years of age. The figures for 1877-78 were, as shown above, thirty-six schools with a roll-call of 2689 names and an average attendance of 1765, or 1\u00b732 per cent of 133,539, the total population of not more than twenty years of age. A comparison with the returns for 1855-56 gives therefore for 1877-78 an increase in the number of schools from seven to thirty-six, while of 133,539, the entire population of the district of not more than twenty years of age, 1\u00b732 per cent were under instruction in 1877-78 against 0\u00b727 per cent in 1855-56.\n\n\u00b9 Closed at the end of 1876-77.\nVernacular schools for girls would seem to have been established in the Panch Mahals but lately. In 1877-78 there was one school of this sort with a roll-call of seventy-five names and an average attendance of forty-seven pupils.\n\nThe 1872 census returns give for each of the chief races of the district the proportion of persons able to read and write:\n\nOf 47,954, the total Hindu male population not exceeding twelve years, 1417 or 2\u00b795 per cent; of 18,363 above twelve and not exceeding twenty years, 1454 or 7\u00b791 per cent; and of 52,087 exceeding twenty years, 3769 or 7\u00b723 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught. Of 43,682, the total Hindu female population not exceeding twelve years, sixty-seven or 0\u00b715 per cent; of 15,834 above twelve and not exceeding twenty years, twenty-five or 0\u00b705 per cent; and of 47,855 exceeding twenty years, thirty-five or 0\u00b707 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught.\n\nOf 2769, the total Musalm\u00e1n male population not exceeding twelve years, 331 or 11\u00b795 per cent; of 1295 above twelve and not exceeding twenty years, 357 or 27\u00b756 per cent; and of 3802 exceeding twenty years, 888 or 23\u00b735 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught. Of 2571, the total Musalm\u00e1n female population not exceeding twelve years, eighteen or 0\u00b770 per cent; of 1059, above twelve and not exceeding twenty years, fourteen or 1\u00b732 per cent; and of 3425 exceeding twenty years, twenty-one or 0\u00b761 per cent were able to read and write or were being taught.\n\nOf Parsis there were but seventeen in the whole district, twelve males and five females. Ten of the former and two of the latter were able to read and write or were being taught.\n\nBefore the year 1865-66 there were no returns arranging the pupils according to race and religion. The statement given in the margin shows that in 1877-78 of the two chief races of the district, the Masalm\u00e1ns have the largest proportion of their boys under instruction. All the seventy-five girls enrolled in 1877-78 in the one girls\u2019 school were Hindus. Of 2354 the total number of pupils in Government schools at the end of December 1877, 411 or 17\u00b745 per cent were Br\u00e1hmans; 6 or 0\u00b725 per cent writers, 2 Kshatris and 4 Parbhus; 611 or 25\u00b795 per cent traders and shopkeepers, 490 V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, 121 Shravaks; 238 or 10\u00b711 per cent cultivators, 115 Kanbis, 80 Rajputs, 25 K\u00e1chhi\u00e1s, 3 M\u00e1\u00eds, 14 Luh\u00e1n\u00e1s and 1 Koli; 232 or 9\u00b785 per cent craftsmen; 4 Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs, calico-printers; 32 Gh\u00e1nchis, oil-pressers; 50 Sonis, gold and silver smiths, 44 Suth\u00e1rs.\n\n---\n\n1 In 1875-76 there were three such schools with a roll-call of 119 names and an average attendance of sixty-three pupils.\ncarpenters; 2 Kans\u00e1ras, coppersmiths, 46 Luh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 7 Kadi\u00e1s, bricklayers; 36 Darjis, tailors; 11 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 409 or 17\u00b737 per cent, B\u00e1rots (404) and Ch\u00e1rnas (5), bards and genealogists; 26 or 1\u00b710 per cent H\u00e1j\u00e1ms, barbers; 68 or 2\u00b788 per cent miscellaneous workers and labourers; 10 Kal\u00e1ls, liquor-sellers; 2 R\u00e1val\u00edas, cotton tapemakers; 1 V\u00e1gri, fowler and hunter; 1 Bh\u00e1dbhunja, grainparcher; 27 Ods, well-diggers and labourers; 1 Jat, 1 B\u00e1vch\u00e1, 3 Kh\u00e1rv\u00e1s, 4 Pardeshi, and 18 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, servants; 13 or 0\u00b755 per cent leather-workers, 8 Mochis and 5 D\u00e1bgars; 27 or 1\u00b714 per cent religious beggars, 9 Vair\u00e1gis, 16 Gos\u00e1is and 2 S\u00e1dhus; 36 or 1\u00b752 per cent unsettled tribes, 3 Vanj\u00e1r\u00e1s, 27 Bhils, and 6 N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s; 5 or 0\u00b721 per cent P\u00e1rsis; 272 or 11\u00b755 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns. No Dhed or Bhangia boys attended the Government schools in this district.\n\nThe following table, prepared from special returns furnished by the educational department, shows in detail the number of schools and pupils with their cost to Government:\n### Panch Mahals School Return, 1855-56, 1865-66, and 1877-78.\n\n| Class | Schools | Hindus | Musalmans | Parsis | Total | Average Daily Attendance |\n|-------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|-------|--------------------------|\n|       |         | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 |\n| Government |         |         |         |         |       |                          |\n| Anglo-Vernacular school |         | 1 | 3 | 256 | 53 | 3 | 4 | (a) 300 | 1449 | 2614 | 75 | 26 | 269 | 1716 |\n| Vernacular school for Boys |         | 6 | 22 | 35 | 1348 | 2393 | 106 | 284 | 3 | 4 | (a) 327 | 1865 | 2659 | 362 | 1162 | 1765 |\n| Girls |         |         |         |         |       |                          |\n| Total |         | 7 | 24 | 36 | 1701 | 2401 | 159 | 284 | 3 | 4 | (a) 327 | 1865 | 2659 | 362 | 1162 | 1765 |\n\n### Fees\n\n| Class | Fee | Cost per Pupil | Receipts |\n|-------|-----|----------------|----------|\n|       |     | s. d. | \u00a3. s. d. | Government | Local Cess. | Municipalities |\n|       |     |       |          |           |             |               |\n| Government |     |       |          |           |             |               |\n| Anglo-Vernacular school |     | 1s. | Varying from \u00bdd to 4\u00bdd | 1 5\u00bd | 14 6\u00bd | 124 | 124 | 124 |\n| Vernacular school for Boys |     | 1\u00bdd. | Varying from \u00bdd to 3d | 0 16 7\u00bd | 391 | 715 | 296 | 296 | 296 |\n| Girls |     |       |          |           |             |               |\n| Total |     |       |          |           |             |               |\n\n(a) In the month of March 1856.\n### Panch Mah\u0101ls School Return, 1855-56, 1865-66, and 1877-78\u2014continued.\n\n| Class | Receipts From | Expenditure On |\n|-------|---------------|----------------|\n|       | Private Individuals | School Fees, &c. | Total | Inspection and Instruction | Buildings | Libraries |\n|       | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 |\n| Government | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 |\n| Anglo-Vernacular school | ... | 2 | 5 | ... | 1 | 29 | ... | 3 | 158 | ... | 2 | 195 | ... |\n| Vernacular school for Boys | ... | 80 | 74 | ... | 63 | 118 | ... | 80 | 529 | ... | 1129 | 63 | 552 | ... |\n| Vernacular school for Girls | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Total | ... | 82 | 79 | ... | 1 | 92 | 118 | ... | 83 | 688 | ... | 1178 | 65 | 757 | ... |\n\n### Expenditure On\n\n| Class | Scholarships | Total |\n|-------|--------------|-------|\n|       | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 | \u00a3 |\n| Government | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 | 1855-56 | 1865-66 | 1877-78 |\n| High school | ... | 21 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Anglo-Vernacular school | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Vernacular school for Boys | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Vernacular school for Girls | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Total | ... | 21 | 65 | 767 | 1219 | ... | 515 | 715 | ... | 386 | 65 | 242 | 118 |\n\n1 Nadiad High school, to which a contribution of \u00a321 is paid from this district.\nA comparison of the present (1877-78) provision for teaching the district town and country population gives the following results.\n\nIn the town of Godhra there were in 1877-78, three Government vernacular schools with, out of 434 names on the rolls, an average attendance of 285 pupils. Of these schools one was an Urdu school and two were Gujarati schools, one for boys, the other for girls; the yearly cost for each pupil was \u00a31 2s. (Rs. 11) in the Urdu, and in the Gujarati 12s. (Rs. 6) in the boys' and \u00a31 (Rs. 10) in the girls' school. In the town of Dohad there was one vernacular school with, out of 273 names on the rolls, an average attendance of 158 pupils. The yearly cost per pupil was 13s. (Rs. 6-8 as.).\n\nExclusive of these four town schools, the district of Panch Mahals was in 1877-78 provided with thirty-two Government vernacular schools, or on an average one school for every eighteen inhabited villages. The following statement shows the distribution of these schools by sub-divisions:\n\n| Sub-Division | Villages | Population | Vernacular |\n|--------------|----------|------------|------------|\n|              |          |            | Boys       | Girls     |\n| Godhra       | ...      | 187        | 63,379     | 10        | ...       |\n| K\u00e1lol        | ...      | 202        | 66,431     | 17        | ...       |\n| Dohad        | ...      | 198        | 100,298    | 5         | ...       |\n| Total        | ...      | 587        | 230,108    | 32        | ...       |\n\nIn this district there are two libraries but no local newspaper. The library at Godhra known as the 'Stewart Library,' was established in 1866-67. The number of subscribers is returned at forty-three and the average annual collections at \u00a324 (Rs. 240). A yearly grant of \u00a320 is received from the Panch Mahals local funds unless the latter are on the decline. The library has a building of its own and is provided with 183 English and 207 Gujarati books and ten maps. The library at Dohad known as the 'Enti Library,' was established in 1869-70. The number of subscribers is returned at seventeen and the average annual collections at \u00a312 (Rs. 120). The library has a building of its own and is provided with a total number of 193 English and vernacular books.\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHEALTH.\n\nThe chief disease, intermittent and remittent fever, becomes common after the setting in of the rains (July), and grows gradually severer and more widespread till towards the close of the year it again abates. In outlying parts so fierce are its attacks that whole outposts are at times unfit for duty. Next to fever the chief diseases are skin affections, bronchitis, rheumatism, worms, ophthalmia and diarrhoea. Before the introduction of vaccination, small-pox was common among the Bhils and Naikdas; but during the last twenty years its outbreaks have become much less fatal. The Superintendent of vaccination says, 'as a class the wild races have taken to vaccination pretty freely, and it may be said that when once begun it is easier to carry on vaccination among them than among other people.'1 In five of the last fifteen years, in 1864, 1865, 1869, 1872 and 1875 the district has been visited by cholera. Except in 1875, when more than a thousand people died in two months, no details of these attacks are available. The Kolis and Naikdas and to a less extent the Bhils use many drugs, dividing them into three classes according as they cure the three chief forms of disease, those due to cold, to heat, and to wind. Arsenic in some of its forms and an impure mercury are much used.\n\nAt present (1878) there are in the district one civil hospital at Dohad and one dispensary at Godhra. During the year 1877, 10,937 persons in all were treated, of whom 731 were in-door and 10,206 out-door patients. These institutions are provided with special buildings. The total amount expended in checking disease in 1877 was \u00a31318 (Rs. 13,180). Of this \u00a3206 (Rs. 2060) were paid from local funds. The following details are taken from the 1877 report. Of 403 in-patients treated in the civil hospital, 365 were cured and 21 died. The out-patients numbered 4232. The average daily sick for in-patients was 13\u00b724 and for out-patients 42\u00b75. The principal diseases were malarious fevers, rheumatism, eye and lung affections, and bowel and skin diseases. The mortality was chiefly due to diarrhoea and dysentery and to lung disease. There were 12 major and 294 minor surgical operations. The Godhra dispensary established in 1870 is provided with a building 63 feet long by 33 feet wide. Inclusive of 228 in-patients, 6202 persons were treated. The chief diseases were malarious fevers, cholera, and skin affections.\n\n1 Superintendent's Memo, 24th April 1875.\nIn 1877-78 the work of vaccination was, under the supervision of the deputy sanitary commissioner in east Gujar\u00e1t, carried on by five vaccinators, with yearly salaries varying from \u00a316 16s. to \u00a328 16s. (Rs. 168-Rs. 288.) All the operators were distributed over the rural parts of the district, one for each sub-division. Exclusive of 1244 re-vaccinations there were 9841 vaccinations compared with 9476 in 1869-70.\n\nThe following abstract shows the sex, religion, and age of the persons vaccinated:\n\n**Panch Mahals Vaccination Details, 1869 and 1877.**\n\n| Year     | Sex          | Religion       | Age            | Total |\n|----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-------|\n|          | Males | Females | Hindus | Musalmans | Parsis | Christians | Others | Under one year | Over one year |       |\n| 1869-70  | 4704  | 4772    | 8778   | 467       | ...    | ...        | 231    | 3980           | 5496         | 9476   |\n| 1877-78  | 5071  | 4770    | 8957   | 496       | 2      | ...        | 386    | 4781           | 5060         | 9841   |\n\nThe total cost of these operations was, in 1877-78, \u00a3423 18s. (Rs. 4239) or about 9\u00bd l. (6\u00bd as.) for each successful case. The entire charge was made up of the following items: supervision and inspection \u00a3268 4s. (Rs. 2682), establishment \u00a3144 14s. (Rs. 1447), and contingencies \u00a311 (Rs. 110). Of these the supervising and inspecting charges and 14s. (Rs. 7) on account of contingencies, were wholly met from Government provincial funds, while the expense of \u00a3155 (Rs. 1550) on account of rural vaccinators was borne by the district local funds.\n\nThe total number of deaths shown in the Sanitary Commissioner's reports for the seven years ending 1878 is 41,629 or an average yearly mortality of 5947, or on the basis of the 1872 census, of 2\u00b747 per cent of the total population. Of the average number of deaths 4140 or 69\u00b761 per cent were returned as due to fever; 405 or 6\u00b781 per cent, to bowel complaints; 813 or 13\u00b767 per cent, to cholera; 62, or 1\u00b704 per cent, to smallpox; and 406 or 6\u00b783 per cent, to miscellaneous diseases. Deaths from violence or accident averaged 121, or 2\u00b703 per cent of the average mortality of the district. During the same period the number of births is returned at 29,161 souls, of whom 15,269 are entered as male and 13,892 as female children, or an average yearly birth-rate of 4166 souls; or on the basis of the 1872 census figures, a birth-rate of 1\u00b773 per cent of the entire population of the district.\n\n---\n\n1 These figures are incorrect, for while the population of the district is increasing the returns show a yearly birth-rate less by 1781 than the death-rate. In a district of Bhils and Naikdas the returns are necessarily very imperfect.\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nSUB-DIVISIONS.\n\nGodhra Sub-division.\u2014The Godhra sub-division is bounded on the north by Lunavada, on the east by Baria, on the south by Kalol, and on the west partly by Baroda territory and partly by the river Mahi. Its area is 583 square miles; its population in 1872, 74,014 souls, or 127 to the square mile; and its realizable land revenue in 1878, \u00a35615 (Rs. 56,150).\n\nArea.\n\nOf its 583 square miles, 203 are occupied by alienated, proprietary, talukdari and uhad, villages. The rest, according to the revenue survey returns, contains 243,556 acres; of these 103,222 acres or 42.38 per cent were arable land, 130,671 acres or 53.65 per cent were forest lands, and 9663 or 3.96 per cent were unarable waste occupied by ponds, river beds, and village sites. From the 103,222 arable acres, 26,685, the area of alienated lands in Government villages, has to be taken. Of the balance 76,537 acres, 65,048 or 85 per cent were in the year 1877-78 under tillage.\n\nAspect.\n\nExcept in the west near the Mahi, where is a well tilled and well wooded tract of light soil, and in the north where the surface is broken by patches and peaks of granite rock, Godhra is a plain country of brushwood and forest with scanty rough tillage.\n\nClimate.\n\nDuring most of the year the Godhra climate is trying. In the cold weather, October to February, fever is common and the natives suffer much from the cold winds; in the hot months, March to June, the heat is sometimes very great; and the rains, June to October, are close and relaxing. The average rainfall at Godhra, during the five years ending 1877, was 45.73 inches.\n\nWater.\n\nThe water of the 311 wells and 134 ponds and reservoirs in this sub-division is used almost entirely for drinking, washing, and for cattle. Only one thirty-third part of the whole area of Government cultivated land is watered. The only rivers of any size are the Mahi on the west, and the Panam on the east and north-east.

As regards occupation the same return arranges the whole population under the seven following heads: i. Employed under Government or municipal or other local authorities, 1,120. ii. Professional persons, 636. iii. In service or performing personal offices, 983. iv. Engaged in agriculture and with animals, (a) cultivators 17,092; (b) labourers 144; total 17,236. v. Engaged in commerce and trade, 1,610. vi. Employed in mechanical arts, manufactures and engineering operations, and engaged in the sale of articles manufactured or otherwise prepared for consumption, 3,612. vii. Miscellaneous persons not classed otherwise, (a) women 19,460 and children 29,059, in all 48,519; and (b) miscellaneous persons 298; total 48,817.\n\nKalol Sub-division.\u2014K\u00e1lol is bounded on the north by Godhra; on the east by B\u00e1riya; on the south by the petty division\nof H\u00e1lo\u00ee; and on the west by Baroda and the P\u00e1ndu Mehv\u00e1s. Compact in form, about twenty miles from east to west, and ten from north to south, it has an area of 145 square miles, a population in 1872 of 40,505 souls, and in 1878 a realizable land revenue of \u00a36644 (Rs. 66,440).\n\nOf its 145 square miles, 19 are occupied by t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri and alienated villages. The rest, according to the revenue survey returns, contains 80,652 acres; 74,107 acres, or 91\u00b788 per cent of these were arable and 6545 or 8\u00b711 per cent were unarable waste occupied by ponds, river beds, and village sites. From the 74,107 arable acres, 19,047 the area of alienated lands in Government villages has to be taken. Of the balance 55,060 acres, 27,505 or 49\u00b795 per cent were in 1877-78 under tillage.\n\nOpen to the west and with some slightly rising ground and patches of brushwood to the east, K\u00e1lol is a rich, well wooded plain, its fields fenced by high hedges and rows of brab palms, and its villages as comfortable and well built as those of Kaira. The eastern hills of metamorphic rock do not rise more than a few hundred feet above the plain. About Ar\u00e1dra they are quaintly capped with grey granite boulders, that look as if about to slip down the smooth hill side. The granite stones used for the embankment of the Mal\u00e1v lake were taken from these hills.\n\nThe average yearly rainfall is returned at 41 inches. Both in climate and water K\u00e1lol is better than Godhra or H\u00e1lo\u00ee.\n\nThis sub-division is crossed from east to west by three rivers, the Mesri in the north, the Goma in the centre, and the Karad in the south. Rising in the B\u00e1riya highlands and flowing to the Mahi they are alike in being dangerous torrents during the rains and in losing their flow of water soon after the cold season begins. In other points they are unlike. The Karad flows over a rocky bed between high steep banks, while the banks of the Mesri and Goma are low and their beds sandy. There are 102 reservoirs and ponds, and of 499 wells 249 are used for watering fields. The Mal\u00e1v reservoir, the largest in the sub-division, waters a large area of rice and sugarcane. The water of the other ponds is used only for watering rice and for domestic purposes.\n\nLight, gor\u00e1du, is the most common soil all over the sub-division; medium, bes\u00e1r, is found in some low-lying villages; pure black soil is unknown. The light soil varies much in quality. Inferior towards the north-east, near K\u00e1lol it is very high class, chalky and sticky, though somewhat sandy.\nThe following statement shows the arable area in Government villages and the rates fixed for thirty years in 1870-71:\n\n| K\u00e1lol Rent Roll, 1870-71. |\n|---------------------------|\n| **Rental, 1871.**          |\n| **ARABLE LAND.**           |\n| **OCCUPIED.**              |\n| **UNOCCUPIED.**            |\n| **TOTAL.**                 |\n| **Acres.**                 |\n| **Rupee Assessment.**      |\n| **Average acre rate.**     |\n| **Acres.**                 |\n| **Rupee Assessment.**      |\n| **Average acre rate.**     |\n| **Acres.**                 |\n| **Rupee Assessment.**      |\n| **Average acre rate.**     |\n| **Rs. a. p.**              |\n| **Rs.**                    |\n| **Rs. a. p.**              |\n\n| Government                  |\n| Dry crop Garden Rice        |\n| Total                       |\n| Alienated                   |\n| Dry crop Garden Rice        |\n| Total                       |\n| Total                       |\n| Dry crop Garden Rice        |\n| Grand Total                 |\n\n| Rs. a. p. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|-----------|---------|\n| 1,15,348 4 0 | 11,534 16 6 |\n| 42,633 10 0 | 4263 7 3 |\n| 72,714 10 0 | 7271 9 3 |\n| 3843 4 0 | 884 6 6 |\n| 1856 10 11 | 185 13 4\u00bd |\n| 83,414 8 11 | 8341 9 1\u00bd |\n\nThe 1872 population, 40,505 souls lodged in 9919 houses, were, in 1877, provided with 578 wells and 174 ponds, and owned 5875 ploughs, 1836 carts, 13,057 oxen, 9480 cows, 4015 buffaloes, 443 horses, 3401 sheep and goats, and 359 asses.\n\nIn 1870-71, the year of settlement, 7113 holdings, kh\u00e1t\u00e1s, were recorded with an average area of $5\\frac{2}{4}$ acres, and a rental of 18s. 4d.

The petty division of H\u00e1lol under K\u00e1lol is bounded on the north by K\u00e1lol, on the east by B\u00e1riya, J\u00e1bughoda, and Chhota Udepur; and on the south and west by Baroda. Its area is 261 square miles; its population in 1872, 25,926 souls, and its realizable land revenue in 1878, \u00a32437 (Rs. 24,370.)\n\nOf its 261 square miles, 128 are occupied by alienated and talukd\u00e1ri villages. The rest according to the revenue survey returns contains 85,411 acres; of these, 82,987 acres or 97\u00b716 per cent including alienated lands in Government villages and lands under the forest\ndepartment of which details are not available, were arable and 2424 acres or 2\u00b784 per cent were unarable waste occupied by ponds, river-beds, and village sites.\n\nH\u00e1lol is a well wooded and well tilled plain surrounding the great hill of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad. To the east and south, low, isolated, scantily wooded hills, stand out from a rich black-soil plain, most of it waste and covered with brushwood.\n\nEspecially within four or five miles of the hills the water is said to be poisonous, and the climate very unhealthy. The average rainfall is 40\u00b744 inches.\n\nThree rivers cross H\u00e1lol from east to west. The Karad on the north, the Vishv\u00e1mriti in the centre from P\u00e1v\u00e1gad, and on the south the Devnadi from the B\u00e1r\u00edya hills. The Devnadi flowing south-west is afterwards known in Broach as the Dh\u00e1dhar. There are 72 ponds and reservoirs, two of them the Vadu and J\u00e1khariya of great size. Water is everywhere near the surface, and round H\u00e1lol there are very many wells. With a richer and less rude peasantry, much of the sub-division might be watered.\n\nTo the north the soil is light, gor\u00e1du, to the east it is sandy, and to the south and west it is black.\n\nAs H\u00e1lol has not yet been surveyed it is without the usual assessment and occupancy details.\n\nThe 1872 population 25,926 souls, lodged in 6612 houses, were, in 1877, provided with 352 wells and 114 ponds, and owned 3986 ploughs, 1563 carts, 10,002 oxen, 15,359 cows, 5147 buffaloes, 362 horses, 5354 sheep and goats, 168 asses, and 5 camels.\n\nIn 1877-78 of 13,713 acres the total area of cultivated land, 1750 or 12\u00b776 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the 11,963 acres under actual cultivation, grain crops occupied 9789 acres, or 81\u00b782 per cent, 3086 acres of them under b\u00e1jri, Penicillaria spicata; 2274 under kodra, Paspalum scrobiculatum; 2167 under rice, d\u00e1ngr, Oryza sativa; 1221 under j\u00fav\u00e1r, Sorghum vulgare; 598 under r\u00e1ji, Eleusine corocana; 262 under maize, mak\u00e1i, Zea mays; 2 under wheat, ghan, Triticum aestivum; and 179 under miscellaneous grains.

Oil seeds occupied 632 acres, or 5\u00b728 per cent, 117 of them under tal, Sesamum indicum; and 515 under other oil seeds. Fibres occupied 10 acres, or 0\u00b708 per cent, 2 of them under cotton, kap\u00e1s, Gossypium herbaceum; and 8 under Bombay hemp, san, Crotalaria juncea. Miscellaneous crops occupied 17 acres, or 0\u00b714 per cent, 7 of them under sugarcane, serdi, Saccharum officinarum; 2 under tobacco, tamb\u00e1ku, Nicotiana tabacum; and 8 under miscellaneous vegetables and fruits.\n\nThe 1872 census returns show of a total population of 25,926 souls, 25,215 or 97\u00b725 per cent, Hindus; 708 or 2\u00b773 per cent, Musalm\u00e1ns; and 3 P\u00e1rsis.

Miscellaneous persons not classed otherwise, (a) women 6716 and children 10,457, in all 17,173; and (b) miscellaneous persons 72; total 17,245.\n\nDohad Sub-division. Dohad, the two boundaries, has on the north the petty division of Jhal\u00f3d; on the east J\u00e1mbua in Central India; on the south Ali R\u00e1jpur in Central India; and on the west B\u00e1riya in Rewa K\u00e1ntha. It is a compact circular tract about 22 miles in diameter, with Dohad, the chief town, nearly in the centre. Its area is 337 square miles, its population in 1872, 63,513 souls, and its land revenue in 1878, \u00a37066 (Rs. 70,660).\n\nOf its 339 square miles, 113 are occupied by alienated and talukd\u00e1ri villages. The rest according to the revenue survey returns contains 144,452 acres; of these 130,860 acres or 90\u00b759 per cent including alienated lands in Government villages and lands under the forest department of which details are not available were arable and 13,592 acres or 9\u00b740 per cent were unarable occupied by ponds, river-beds, and village sites.\n\nUnlike other parts of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, Dohad is pleasantly varied with hills, rich valleys, and waving sparsely-wooded plains, rising into high peaks crested with snow-white quartz. The land has a long-settled look. The brick and mortar houses of the richer classes are grouped in villages, but by far the greater number have their wattle and daub homesteads dotted over the village lands or clustered round the village pond. On the whole there is no prettier or naturally richer country in Gujar\u00e1t. Though hilly throughout, there are no specially marked peaks or ridges. The water-shed of the district is a tableland from four to six miles broad, the extension of the \u00c1r\u00e1vali range from Rajput\u00e1na southwards, between Dohad and B\u00e1riya. The rise of the land from Godhra though gradual is well marked.\nChapter XIII.\n\nSub-divisions.\n\nDohad.\n\nWater.\n\nThe main river, the An\u00e1s flows throughout the year along the eastern boundary. Many of its tributaries, of which the chief are the Kasba, the Kh\u00e1ri, the K\u00e1l\u00ed, the Gangri, the K\u00e1veri and the Barod, wandering across it, and generally flowing throughout the year, water the whole of Dohad. The country is specially suited for storing water, and has some very large reservoirs holding water throughout the year.\n\nSoil.\n\nReddish in trap and light fawn-coloured in quartz uplands, the soil in the lower levels is black.\n\nRent Roll.\n\nAs Dohad has not yet been surveyed it is without the usual assessment and occupancy details.\n\nStock, 1876-77.\n\nThe 1872 population 63,513 souls, lodged in 13,936 houses, were, in 1877, provided with 598 wells and 15 ponds, and owned 10,009 ploughs, 1839 carts, 22,151 oxen, 21,543 cows, 10,437 buffaloes, 868 horses, 11,787 sheep and goats, 421 asses, and 14 camels.\n\nProduce, 1877-78.\n\nIn 1877-78 of 38,836 acres, the total area of cultivated land, 8583 or 22\u00b710 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the 30,253 acres under actual cultivation, grain crops occupied 18,833 acres, or 62\u00b725 per cent, 14,043 acres of them under maize, mak\u00e1i, Zea mays; 2429 under rice, d\u00e1g\u00e1r, Oryza sativa; 878 under kodra, Paspalum scrobiculatum; 239 under r\u00e1gi, Eleusine coracana; 225 under wheat, ghau, Triticum aestivum; 145 under juv\u00e1r, Sorghum vulgare; 13 under b\u00e1jri, Penicillaria spicata; 88 under barley, jav, Hordeum hexastichon; and 773 under miscellaneous grains.

Oil seeds occupied 2391 acres, or 7\u00b790 per cent, 2249 of them under tal, Sesamum indicum; and 142 under other oil seeds. Fibres occupied 386 acres, or 1\u00b727 per cent, all under Bombay hemp, san, Crotalaria juncea.

The petty division of Jhalod under Dohad is bounded on the north by the Chelkari state, and on the east by the Kushalgad state, both in Central India; on the south by Dohad, and on the west by Bariya and Sunth in the Rewa Kantha. The Anas river runs along its entire eastern face. Its area is 267 square miles and its population in 1872, 36,785 souls or 138 to the square mile, and its realizable land revenue in 1878, \u00a33870 (Rs. 38,700).\n\nAs the Jhalod survey is not finished, area and tillage details cannot be given.\n\nExcept that there are wider stretches of black soil, Jhalod is much like Dohad.\n\nAs in Dohad the climate is better than in the western division. The average rainfall is returned at about 28 inches.\n\nThe Makan and Kali rivers on their way to the Anas cross the district from north to south. Water is in most places close to the surface and large areas are watered by lever-lifts, dhekudis, from unbuilt wells.\n\nThe light, gor\u00e1du, soil is like that of Dohad. There is much fine alluvium in the Makan valley especially about Limbd\u00ed. The black soil is a rich deposit of decayed vegetable mould. Most lands in the sub-division can yield two harvests, an early kharif crop of maize, and a late rabi crop of wheat or grain.\n\nAs Jhalod has not yet been surveyed there are no assessment or occupancy details.\n\nThe 1872 population 36,785 souls, lodged in 8634 houses, were, in 1877, provided with 381 wells and 43 ponds, and owned 6395 ploughs, 879 carts, 13,471 oxen, 12,279 cows, 6706 buffaloes, 563 horses, 4580 sheep and goats, and 442 asses.\nIn 1877-78 of 23,259 acres, the total area of cultivated land, 4940 or 21\u00b723 per cent were fallow or under grass. Of the 18,319 acres under actual cultivation, grain crops occupied 11,993 acres, or 65\u00b746 per cent, 8591 acres of them under maize, *mak\u00e1ri*, Zea mays; 1716 under rice, *d\u00e1ngar*, Oryza sativa; 564 under *kodra*, *Paspalum scrobiculatum*; 189 under wheat, *ghau*, *Triticum aestivum*; 31 under *juv\u00e1r*, Sorghum vulgare; 134 under *r\u00e1gi*, Eleusine corocana; 25 under barley, *jav*, Hordeum hexastichon; 15 under *b\u00e1jri*, Penicillaria spicata; and 728 under miscellaneous grains.

About five miles south-west of Dohad, at the village of Bh\u00e1vka is a ruined temple of Mah\u00e1dev, apparently of considerable age. It seems to have originally been an octagon, each side of eight feet with single-stone lintels supported on octagonal pillars, five feet round at the base and four below the capital. At the entrance of the shrine is a figure of Ganpati holding in his hands what seems to be a battle axe. On the outside are the remains of three belts of sculpture, the highest rude and somewhat indecent figures, the second elephants, and the third groups of very small figures of men and beasts. According to a local story this temple was built by courtezans at the time (746-1483) of the prosperity of Hindu Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner.\n\nBhimkund. About five miles south of Dohad near where the village lands of Vij\u00e1pur, Brahmakhed, and R\u00e1mdungra meet, is a large earthen basin formed by a waterfall about seventy feet high. Here four days before Holi (April) thousands of Bhils come, some of them from considerable distances. Those who have during the year lost friends, relations, or parents bring their ashes with them and throw them into the pool. Then they wash and going to Br\u00e1hmans, always there in great numbers, have a red spot, ch\u00e1ndla, marked on the brow and in return give some small present in money or grain. Then drinking begins and, if money lasts so long, is kept up for about a fortnight.\n\nChakki-no-a'ro. In the Karad river between the villages of Med\u00e1pur and Marva in H\u00e1lo\u00ed is the Chakhhi-no-\u00e1ro or Grindstone bank, one of the most singular spots in the district. In the middle of the river where the channel is deepest is a large rock over which, in ordinary course, the stream would flow and fall in a cascade into the deep pool below. But above the rock a rectangular reservoir, kund, has been built about fifteen feet square, and four to five feet deep, partly of brick and partly of rock, the large rock forming its lowest side. Into this pool the water of the river runs, and passes out of it, not over the large rock, but by a six or eight feet long channel cut from the deepest part of the reservoir right through the centre of the rock. Out of this, from the centre of the rock, the water spouts and falls into a deep pool several feet below. The place is sacred, and at eclipses of the sun and at the Mahoda P\u00e1rv on Somvati Am\u00e1s, when the last day of the month falls on a Monday, and on other occasions is visited by Br\u00e1hmans, Kshatris, and V\u00e1ni\u00e1s, who bathe and wash away their sins in the pool. The legend is that a certain R\u00e1ja Sulochan of Benares was troubled with\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces of Interest.\n\na growth of hair on the palms of his hands, sent him as a punishment for his sins. As none of the Benares seers could cure him he was advised to go to the famous Vishv\u00e1mitra, who lived where P\u00e1v\u00e1gad now stands. Vishv\u00e1mitra told him that if he sacrificed at a spot in the river where a sacred grindstone lay, his sins should be destroyed as grain is ground to powder in a grindstone. The R\u00e1ja went to the spot, built a place of sacrifice, and in a great rock cut a conduit through which to feed with butter the fire of his sacrifice. Thus was he freed from his sins and from the hair growth. The river became known as the Hand or Kar, since corrupted into Karad Ganga, and the place of sacrifice as the Chakki-no-\u00e1ro or Grindstone bank. Half the grindstone is still there, the other half was stolen by a Gos\u00e1i, who, pursued, was forced to throw away the grindstone where it still lies between the villages of Viasra and Al\u00e1li in K\u00e1lol.\n\nIn the bank of the Karad opposite to, but it is said in no way connected with the Grindstone shore, is an opening in the rock three to four feet high. This is said to be one end of the underground passage whose other end is at the M\u00e1chi Haveli half way up P\u00e1v\u00e1gad. Major Fulljames from the P\u00e1v\u00e1gad end and Mr. Acworth from the Med\u00e1pur end have both passed some little way up it. But even among the natives of the place there would seem to be no known case of any one passing through or even going any considerable distance along this tunnel.\n\nCha'mpa'ner.\n\nCha'mpa'ner, north latitude 22\u00b0 30' and east longitude 73\u00b0 30', lies nearly a mile to the north-east of the main body of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hill, about twenty-five miles east of Baroda and forty-two south of Godhra. Though at present (1878), except for a few Bhil and N\u00e1ikda squatters, almost entirely deserted, Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner is a place of much historic interest and has many remains of its former greatness.\n\nHistory.\n\nThe name is said to come from Ch\u00e1mpa, according to one account a V\u00e1nia, and according to another a Kanbi, who founded the city during the reign of Van R\u00e1j of Anhilv\u00e1da (746-806). In the eleventh century R\u00e1m Gaur the Tu\u00e1r is styled P\u00e1v\u00e1's lord. But he seems to have held under the Anhilv\u00e1da kings for, at least till the eleventh century, and probably until in 1297 their power was crushed by Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji, Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner continued one of their chief eastern strongholds. About the same time as the fall of Anhilv\u00e1da, Choh\u00e1n Rajputs flying before Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji settled at Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. This family, though since 1484 deprived of its chief seat, is still represented by the rulers of the Chhota Udepur and Devgad B\u00e1riya states. The names of the Choh\u00e1n chiefs of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, recorded in an inscription found at N\u00e1h\u00e1n\u00ed Umarv\u00e1n near H\u00e1lo, are R\u00e1ja Shri R\u00e1ma'dev, Shri Ch\u00e1ngdev, Shri Ch\u00e1chingdev, Shri Son\u00e1md\u00e9v, Shri P\u00e1lhansingh, Shri Jitkaran,\n\n---\n\n1 Contributed by Mr. H. Acworth, C.S.\n2 Ch\u00e1mpa is also called a Bhil; As, Res. IV. 187.

Rajput Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner would seem to have lain at the foot of the northeast slopes of the hill just under the fortress of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad. Though besieged and made to pay tribute in 1418 (821-822 H.), and again more hardly pressed about 1450 (853-854 H.), the strength of their hill enabled the Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner chiefs to maintain their independence, fighting freely at times with their neighbour and rival the R\u00e1o of Idar. In 1483 (887 H.) during a season of scarcity Malik Asad, one of Sult\u00e1n Mahmud Begada\u2019s captains (1452-1511), raiding in Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner territory was attacked, defeated, and slain by R\u00e1val Jayasingh. In revenge Mahmud sent an army to Baroda, and refusing all means of settlement except \u2018the sword and the dagger\u2019, attacked Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. The siege had lasted about a year when the R\u00e1val again made overtures of peace offering to pay 360 pounds of gold. This the Sult\u00e1n refused, declaring that he would not leave till the fort was taken. Jayasingh now applied for help to Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-din of M\u00e1lwa. But Mahmud advanced to Dohad and, without striking a blow, the M\u00e1lwa king retired. On his return to Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, to show the besieged that he would not leave till the fort was taken, Mahmud laid the foundations of a beautiful mosque. Meanwhile the besiegers gradually pushing on their outworks took the fort in 1484. The wounded R\u00e1val falling into the Sult\u00e1n\u2019s hands was at first well treated, but after six months, refusing to embrace Isl\u00e1m, he was put to death. One of his sons, brought up as a Musalm\u00e1n, was in the next reign ennobled under the title of Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk.\n\nOn the fall of the fort Mahmud changed the name of the city to Mahmudabad Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. Pleased with the climate he made it his capital, building a fort, a mosque, and a palace and bringing nobles and ministers to settle. Many great buildings were raised, and gardens laid out and, by the skill of a native of Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n, well fitted with fountains and waterfalls. Its fruits, especially its mangoes, were famous, and its sandal trees grew so freely that their timber was used in house building. Merchants and craftsmen thronged its streets, Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner swordblades became noted for their sharpness, and Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner silks for their bright colours. Though he by no means deserted Ahmedabad, Mahmud continued to the close of his reign (1511) to consider Mahmudabad Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner his capital. Mahmud\u2019s successors following his example, Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner remained till the death of Bah\u00e1d\u00far Sh\u00e1h (1536) the political capital of Gujar\u00e1t. During this time the close connection between M\u00e1lwa and Gujar\u00e1t favoured the city\u2019s growth and the safety with which their treasures could be stored in its hill fort gave it a special value in the Sult\u00e1ns\u2019 eyes. Though, even at its best (1514) a place neither of so great trade nor so large as Ahmedabad, like it Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner was \u2018embellished with good streets and squares and houses of stone and\n\n---\n\n1 R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1, 268.\n2 This Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n\u00ed is said to have introduced into Gujar\u00e1t the knowledge of fountains and artificial waterfalls. The best garden was at H\u00e1lo\u00ed, planned by a Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner carpenter who, by working under him disguised as a labourer, had learned the secret of the stranger\u2019s art. Ind. Ant.

The country round was very fertile, full of abundant provisions, wheat, barley, millet, rice, peas and other vegetables, and many cows, sheep, goats and plenty of fruit. Near it were hunting grounds for deer and other animals and winged game. The king kept many wild animals, and trained hunting dogs, falcons and tame leopards.\u00b9\n\nIn 1526 at Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner the young Sult\u00e1n Sikandar Sh\u00e1h was murdered and his successor Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h crowned.\u00b2 Continuing through his reign (1526-1536) to be Bah\u00e1dur\u2019s capital and headquarters, the city was, in 1535, pillaged by the Emperor Hum\u00e1yun. Bah\u00e1dur\u2019s death in the next year and the transfer of the court and capital to Ahmedabad prevented Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner regaining its former position. Off the main lines of traffic, the loss of Gujar\u00e1t ascendancy over M\u00e1lwa, took away from Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner its chief claim to importance. Its fall was rapid. In 1554 its only points of interest were fine banyan trees, large fruit-eating bats and thorny brushwood.\u00b3 Like the rest of Gujar\u00e1t it suffered during the disorders of the next twenty years (1554-1574). But unlike Ahmedabad and Surat the establishment of order under the Emperor Akbar (1578-1605) brought Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner no return of prosperity. At the beginning of the seventeenth century \u2018its air was weakening, its water poisonous, and its orchards and gardens the lair of the tiger and lion. Its buildings had fallen in ruins, and its people had given their goods to the winds of destruction. Instead of flowers were thorns, and instead of gardens close-knotted brushwood, and of its sandal groves neither the name nor the trace was left. It showed the truth of the verse, \u2018All on earth fades and God does as he wills\u2019.\u2074 Though desolate, Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner continued in name the head of a district of nine sub-divisions, part at least settled and rich enough to be included in R\u00e1ja Todar Mal\u2019s survey (1576).\u2075 Under the Moghals Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner was subordinate to Godhra, tillage declined and by the middle of the seventeenth century so much of the country had\n\n\u00b9 Stanley\u2019s Barbosa, 58.\n\u00b2 Sikandar Sh\u00e1h, murdered by Im\u00e1d-ul-mulk, was buried at H\u00e1lo.

But the regular population was larger, for most had heard of the approach of the troops and fled. At that time about half of the walled enclosure or citadel was occupied by a settlement of silk and brocade weavers.\\(^2\\) A few years later (1812) there were about 400 houses, half of them inhabited, the people chiefly runaways from other Gujar\u00e1t cities.\\(^3\\) In 1829 silk weavers were still settled at Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner but their number had lately been terribly thinned by cholera.\\(^4\\) When (1853, July 31st) it came under British management the place was almost deserted. A sum of \u00a3126 (Rs. 1260) was spent in an attempt to bring cultivators to settle and clear the forest. But the colony failed. Three-fourths died and the rest fled. Since then but little progress has been made. Except the constables of the police post, its only inhabitants are a few families of poor and sickly Kolis and N\u00e1ikd\u00e1s.\n\nComing\\(^5\\) from Godhra the first sign of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner\u2019s former greatness is, at H\u00e1lo\u0142, Sikandar Sh\u00e1h\u2019s (1536) tomb, a rather plain one-storied sandstone building in the Muhammadan or arched style. On the J\u00e1mbughoda road, about two and a half miles beyond H\u00e1lo\u0142, stands a small brightly-plastered tomb, the shrine of Khon Pir, a saint revered by the T\u00e1is or Musalm\u00e1n weavers. A few hundred yards to the north-east of Khon Pir\u2019s tomb rises from the brushwood a minaret known as the *Ek Min\u00e1rka Masjid*, The One Minaret Mosque, and half a mile to the south close to P\u00e1v\u00e1gad another small mosque called from a group of trees the *P\u00e1nch Mahud\u00e1ka Masjid*, The Five Mahuda Trees Mosque. About three quarters of a mile beyond Khon Pir\u2019s tomb a bare lonely stone arch, once the west gate of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, comes in view. To the right before passing through the arch is a square pond, once surrounded by masonry steps, and filled from the hill above by a massive stone drain of which there are still traces. The pond is commonly known as the *Kash\u00edn tal\u00e1w* or Courtezan\u2019s pond. But the real builder was Sakar Kh\u00e1n, a Path\u00e1n of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, whose stone tomb, with finely cut windows and handsome dome, stands at one corner. At the ruined gateway the line of the old wall can be traced about 330 yards south to the foot of the north P\u00e1v\u00e1gad spur; then turning west at right angles it crosses the mouth of a ravine to a ridge to the west up whose steep face it runs, till it reaches the scarp on the top of which stand the Julian Budan gate and wall.

As is the case with the account of the P\u00e1v\u00e1gad remains, almost all the materials for this section have been supplied by Mr. H. A. Acworth, C.S.\ndetached ridge of hills on whose eastern slope stood the palace of a brother-in-law of one of the P\u00e1t\u00e1i R\u00e1vals.\\(^1\\) From the crest of this ridge the wall turns sharply back to the south-west and then stretches east.\n\nPassing through the west gateway the road for about a mile crosses an open plain once covered with the buildings of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. To the north the line of wall, after coming back from the crest of the ridge, runs parallel to and close by the road. At first brick and cement, the old wall is soon replaced by a massive line of free stone that, after running east for about a mile, is crossed by a second line of old wall that stretches south 220 yards to P\u00e1v\u00e1gud.\\(^2\\) At the foot of the spur it crosses a stream, then turns west, and in a bending line runs along the spur, gradually rising till it meets the first, or atak, line of the hill fortification.\n\nThe massive line of free stone is Mahmud Begada\u2019s wall, the Jah\u00e1npan\u00e1h or world shelter, surrounding the citadel or Bhadar\\(^3\\) of Mahmudabad Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner. Enclosing an area about three-quarters of a mile long and 280 yards broad, this wall, of great strength, and about thirty feet high, has at regular intervals bastions running north and east at right angles. Though much overgrown with creepers and clinging trees, the wall is in almost perfect repair. A few hundred yards from its western corner is the south or southwest gateway. At the entrance, the line of wall falls back about 120 feet, and the road into the citadel lies between the two lines of wall through a rectangular building, probably a guard room, about 150 feet long and 120 wide, with double gates, and in the south wall richly carved stone windows. On the inner gate is a Persian inscription of which the first figure of a date and the words Muzaffar Sh\u00e1h,\\(^4\\) son of Mahmud Sh\u00e1h, can still be read. Inside of the citadel a little west of the gateway is the Shehrka Masjid or City Mosque, a beautiful building in fair repair. About 200 yards east and near the centre of the citadel is the M\u00e1ndvi or custom house. This probably used as a guard room, is highly finished, very simple, and well proportioned. \u2018Nearly square, it is open at two ends, each open face having six bays and the two ends joined by five rows of arches, the whole forming a colonnaded chamber of five nearly equal aisles. The roof is flat and massive and though without ornament, is much relieved on the inside.\u2019\\(^5\\) From the Mandvi to the citadel\u2019s east gate stretches modern Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, a single street of mean huts. The east gate, built on the same plan as the south gate, equally massive, has the same inscription and the same guard room, only less ruined. About fifty yards east of the gate is the J\u00e1ma Masjid, or Public Mosque, for massive grandeur and perfect finish inferior to no Musalm\u00e1n\n\n---\n\n1 P\u00e1t\u00e1i R\u00e1val is probably a general name contracted from P\u00e1v\u00e1p\u00e1ti, that is, P\u00e1v\u00e1-ruling.

The side tablets remain each engraved with a verse from the Kor\u00e1n. But the central slab once adorned with the date-line \u2018Prayers and a Pulpit,\u2019 is gone.\u00b2 The top of one of the two chief minarets has been shattered by a cannon shot wantonly fired at it by the tyrant P\u00e1tankar, Sindhi\u2019s Governor in 1812? About a third of a mile north of the citadel is another fine mosque, the Nagina Masjid or Jewel Mosque, built of very pure white stone. Close to it is a large brick well, spanned by a stone arch, nearly surrounded by a wall and with stone conduits and other water-works. In front of the mosque is a colonnaded building like the M\u00e1ndyi but smaller. West of the Nagina Masjid, between it and the hill the minarets of a mosque stand out from the trees. This is called after B\u00e1va M\u00e1n, a very popular saint in Baroda and a follower of Sadan Sh\u00e1h whose shrine stands on the roof of Maha K\u00e1l\u00ed\u2019s temple on P\u00e1v\u00e1gad top.\n\nThrough the forest east of the citadel, runs the Shik\u00e1ri Kot or Hunter\u2019s Fort, a low ruined wall enclosing the remains of many hundred houses. About a mile and a half east of the citadel, on the bank of the Great Lake or Bada Tal\u00e1v, stand the ruins of the Sult\u00e1n\u2019s palace and of a mosque. South of the road near the foot of the hill the shattered foundations of houses and a few Jain temples show the site of Rajput Ch\u00e1mpaner, which besides covering the plain between the Musalm\u00e1n citadel and the hill foot, ran up the side of the spur to the line of the first or outer fort wall. Besides these remains of the city proper the forest is for miles round strewn with massive wells, minarets, mouldering tombs, and solitary arches, all that is left of the suburbs, gardens, and palaces, that adorned the city of Mahmud Begada.\u00b3\n\nDesar. At Desar near Sonipur in H\u00e1lol, is an old stone temple of Mah\u00e1dev. Though only twenty feet square and not more than twenty feet high, it is a most striking building: its sides richly carved from base to roof with the beautifully broken outline of the old Gujar\u00e1t Br\u00e1hmanic and Jain buildings. Near the foot runs an elephant scroll, above the elephants two scrolls of human figures, the lower very small the upper somewhat larger, then two belts of\n\n\u00b9 Its outer outline is more effective than that of any of the Ahmedabad mosques. It is surrounded by a high stone wall with handsome buttressed corners each rising into a short minaret. On the outside the line of the wall is, on the sides, broken by rich windows with overhanging pillared balconies. Along the back it is broken by a row of sixteen unarched windows, filled with finely cut stone tracery, and between each pair of windows a rounded tower or dwarf minaret, whose pinnacle ends a little below the upper edge of the wall. In front, on each side of the gateway, stands a finely proportioned minaret, and behind the minarets the centre of the mosque rises double-storied and domed, built entirely in the deep-eaved flat Hindu style.\n\n\u00b2 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta IV. 70. The words give the date 914 H. 1508.\n\n\u00b3 The most noticeable of these remains are at Jopura, about two miles north by east of Ch\u00e1mpaner a ruined mosque on the bank of a small pond; at R\u00e1hipura, east of Ch\u00e1mpaner a fine old step well with solid masonry arches; at Chaturdi V\u00e1v south of R\u00e1hipura another fine step well probably Hindu repaired by Musalm\u00e1ns. Though imbedded in forest the water of both these wells is clear and sweet. In the southeast, a short way up the hillside near where the east city wall joins the hill fortifications, is a ruined mosque probably once used by the garrison.\nstone tracery above that, its chief feature a scroll of human figures nearly life size, well carved and life-like, and over all a rich deep-cut cornice partly in ruins. Its probable date is somewhat late in the time of Hindu Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner (1300-1484). But it contains no inscription and has not yet been critically examined.\n\nDev Keda' r. Near the village of Ch\u00f3s\u00e1la, about seven miles north of Dohad, a stream runs into a cave. In this spot an image of Mah\u00e1dev under the name of K\u00e9d\u00e1reshvar has been set up. Many Bhils visit the shrine, especially on Ph\u00e1g\u00e1n Sud 11th (March).\n\nIn the villages of Nav\u00e1g\u00e1m, about seven miles north-east, G\u00e1ngadia, eleven miles south, and Nelsu, about nine miles south-west of Dohad, every year on the day after Holi (April) a ceremony called the chul or hearth takes place. In a trench seven feet by three and about three feet deep, kher, Mimosa catechu, logs are carefully and closely packed till they stand in a heap about two feet above ground. The pile is then set on fire and allowed to burn to the level of the ground. The village Bhangia or sweeper breaks a cocoanut, kills a couple of fowls, and sprinkles a little liquor near the pile. Then, after washing their feet, the sweeper and the village headman walk barefoot hurriedly across the fire. After this strangers come to fulfil vows, and giving one anna and a half cocoanut to the sweeper, and the other half cocoanut to the headman, wash their feet and turning to the left walk over the pile. The fire seems to cause none of them any pain.\n\nDohad or Dwahad,\u00b9 a town in 1872 of 11,472 inhabitants, stands in north latitude 22\u00b0 50' and east longitude 70\u00b0 18' on the border, dohad, of Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa, about forty-three miles east of Godhra. The town lies in a slight hollow girt by ridges of low hills at the entrance to the chief pass between Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa. Of 11,472, the population in 1872, 7572 or 66 per cent were Hindus, 3877 or 33\u00b779 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, twenty-one Christians, and two others. A large section of the people, especially the community of D\u00e1di or Shia Bohor\u00e1s, are prosperous traders, living in well built brick houses. The chief town of a large sub-division and for long a place of importance, Dohad has a considerable population of craftsmen, and supplies a wide tract of country with earthen and brass ware, and to some extent with cloth. The only special local manufactures are those of blackwood, hair-combs, and lac bracelets. On the high road between M\u00e1lwa and Gujar\u00e1t it has always been, and though somewhat injured by the opening (1875) of the Ratl\u00e1m and Indor railway, is still a place of considerable trade. Its exports are of vegetables, gram, wheat, maize, rice, and castor-oil to M\u00e1lwa, and gram, wheat, maize, and sweet-oil to Gujar\u00e1t, and of animal products, clarified butter, to M\u00e1lwa and Gujar\u00e1t, lac to Ahmedabad and Ratl\u00e1m, and hides and horns to Bombay. Its imports are of minerals, iron and copper from Bombay, and salt from Kh\u00e1r\u00e9ghoda on the Ran of Cutch; of vegetables, cocoanuts and spices from Bombay, tobacco from\n\n\u00b9 Most of the materials for the Dohad town have been supplied by Mr. K. S. Nariman, Civil Surgeon of Dohad.\nNadi\u00e1d, sugar and molasses from Bombay, grain from Benares by Indor, and from R\u00e1jgad near Bhop\u00e1var. Of manufactured articles European jaconets, madarpalams, mullmulls, chintzes, and dhotars come from Bombay by P\u00e1li; from Ahmedabad and Kaira come chhidris or fine s\u00e1ll\u00e1s, dori\u00e1s for petticoats, dhotars for waistcloths, and sacking, kh\u00e1rki or dangri, for the use of Bhils; from Indor and Burh\u00e1npur, turbans and head cloths; from Part\u00e1bga\u1e0d, black and indigo robes or s\u00e1ll\u00e1s; and from Ratl\u00e1\u1e41 chhidris and kh\u00e1r\u00fa\u00e1s for robes and dori\u00e1s for petticoats, susi for the higher classes and n\u00e1dra for the Bhils. During the last two years the exhaustion of grain stocks, from export to the Deccan and the failure of crops in Gujar\u00e1t, have given rise to large imports of maize, millet, and wheat from Dh\u00e1r, Indor, Ujain, Ratl\u00e1\u1e41, and other Central Indian grain marts.\n\nDohad is an old town. In early times Dadhichi Rishi is said to have lived there and in his honour the river was called Dadhimati, a temple on its banks was dedicated to Dudheshvar Mah\u00e1dev, and the town named Dudhipurnagar. It is said to have been a settlement of B\u00e1hria Rajputs. Seven or eight families of this tribe still live in Dohad, and, as the remnants of the first settlers, perform ceremonies and offer sacrifices to propitiate the gods when the town is attacked with epidemic disease. It remained under a line of Rajput chiefs till in the beginning of the fifteenth century (1419) Sult\u00e1n Ahmad I. (1411-1443) defeated Dongar R\u00e1ja, destroyed his palace, and in its place raised a citadel.\u00b9 With the rest of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, Dohad passed to the Emperor Akbar in the end of the sixteenth century (1573-1583), and about the middle of the eighteenth century fell into Sindia\u2019s hands (1750-1760). Under Sindia Dohad was the seat of a governor, and was in 1785 one of the best towns on the line of march between Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lwa, with brick houses and well-to-do inhabitants, especially a number of Bohora Musalm\u00e1ns.\u00b2 With the rest of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls Dohad passed under British management in 1853.\n\nThe town is of two parts, the old town in the west and the new town, most of it built during the last century, close to the old town on the east. Coming from Godhra at the west end of the town are the traces of an old gateway and a line of walls running south to the river and about 500 yards beyond, another line of walls enclosing a square space about 500 yards each way. The only part of the old wall still standing is the eastern or P\u00e1ni gate. From their foundations the walls seem to have been brick, and to have had four gates, two in the west, and two in the east. The portions of the old town still remaining are the Des\u00e1iv\u00e1da, the Khad\u00e1et\u00e1v\u00e1da, and the Gh\u00e1nchiv\u00e1da. The places of interest connected with the old town are, on the left of the entrance gate coming from Godhra, a lake known as the Chh\u00e1ba Tal\u00e1v or Basket Pond.

Of this early fort there would seem now to be no trace.\n\u00b2 Forbes\u2019 Or. Mem. III. 181.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces of Interest.\n\nDohad.\n\nRemains.\n\ndug by men of the Od caste, about the same time as the Odv\u00e1da lake near Godhra, about a mile and a half round, is one of the finest pieces of water in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls and is surrounded by a flight of stone steps with strong retaining end walls and a waste water sluice. From the great scarcity of wells in the town, its water is of special value, and is used throughout the year. In the lake are two islands where, towards the close of the eighteenth century, pleasure houses were built by B\u00e1pu S\u00e1heb P\u00e1tankar, whose son A'pa S\u00e1heb was married to Daulatrav Sindia's (1794-1820) daughter. According to one account the Panch Mah\u00e1ls were given by Sindia as his daughter's dowry. B\u00e1pu S\u00e1heb was made governor and asked to send his son to live at Gw\u00e1lior. B\u00e1pu refused, saying that Sindia's daughter should come and live with her husband at Dohad. To this Sindia would not agree. A force was sent against Dohad with orders to bring back the young A'pa S\u00e1heb but without harming a hair of his head. B\u00e1pu retired to P\u00e1v\u00e1gad, and knowing that the besiegers would not fire at him is said to have set his son in front of the fort. After a time P\u00e1tankar surrendered, and with his son was taken to Gw\u00e1lior. Another account states that the force was sent by Sindia to punish P\u00e1tankar who, recalled for oppression, had refused to leave the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. This story states that after his capture on his way to Gw\u00e1lior, P\u00e1tankar committed suicide outside of the south Dohad gate at a spot marked by a banian tree since known as the Bhuti\u00e1vad or ghost's figtree. On the east bank of the Chh\u00e1ba lake a Bohora vegetable garden, known as the Dongarv\u00e1da or Dongar's garden, marks the site of the old Rajput chief's palace. Another relic of the old Rajput city is in the south the Gh\u00e1nchiv\u00e1da Masjid or Oilman's mosque, said to have been built on the site and of the stones of the old chief's zen\u00e1na. Close to the mosque is a pond, the Chandan Tal\u00e1v or Sandal Lake.\n\nOn the south bank of the river, nearly opposite the oilman's mosque and close to a banian tree is a small building with a tomb inside. The story is that on the banks of the Dohad river one of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n's wives was (1619) seized with the pains of childbirth. The court astrologer declared that if the child was born before a certain hour he would bring bad luck, but if after a certain hour he would become a mighty monarch. To avert misfortune the astrologer counselled the Emperor to have the lady hung head down from a branch of the banian tree. The device succeeded but at the cost of the mother's life.\n\nBuildings.\n\nNew Dohad though not walled has four gateways, on the west in the line of the old city wall on the way to the lake, the P\u00e1ni or water gate; to the east a double gateway, the Hanum\u00e1n gate inside and the Koliv\u00e1da gate outside; to the south the Dhola gate; and to the south-west facing the Hanum\u00e1n gate, the Luh\u00e1riv\u00e1da gate. The oldest quarter of the new town is on the west, the Gujar\u00e1t\u00ed market built by Nima V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s, refugees from\n\n---\n\n1 The story is that the Ods, under Jasma Odin, were on their way to the court of Sidh R\u00e1j Jai Singh (1094-1146). So great was the army of diggers that, to finish the Chh\u00e1ba lake, each had only once to fill his basket.\n\n2 This tomb is said to have been (1619) raised over Aurangzeb's after-birth.\nChamp\u00e1ner in 1779; the next quarter, the four markets that meet at the police guardhouse in the centre of the town, built in 1782; the third, to the north-east, is the Daulatganj market, built in 1805; the fourth, to the north-west, between the lake and the citadel, is the Bohor\u00e1v\u00e1da, built in 1809; and the fifth, built in 1850-1852, is in the south-east, the Ganeshpur market. The chief object of interest in the new town is a caravanserai built in 1619 by the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n in honour of Aurangzeb's birth. It is a square enclosure about 450 feet each way, surrounded by a brick wall sixteen feet seven inches high with bastions at each corner and two grand gateways, one at the middle of the north and the other at the middle of the south wall. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s added three round towers twenty-four feet high at the south-west corner and at the middle of the west and east walls. At the south-east corner P\u00e1tankar built for his son a three-storied house, called the b\u00e1ridv\u00e1ri or twelve gates, now used as quarters for the jailors. Inside, the walls were surrounded by rows of arched rooms opening inwards, and in the centre of the west half of the enclosure was a mosque. This caravanserai is now used for public buildings, the east half as a jail, and of the west, the south corner, where was the residence of Sindi\u00e1's governor, as the m\u00e1latd\u00e1r's office, and the north as mounted police lines. The mosque is used as a magazine for the Bhil corps. To the north of the caravanserai lies the cantonment with police lines and a civil hospital.\n\nThe town is supplied with two rest-houses, dharmsh\u00e1l\u00e1s. One, in the west on the south bank of the lake, able to hold about 200 travellers, was built in 1828 by the governor of the town, Ant\u00e1ji D\u00e1modar; the other, at the south-east corner of the town, with room for about 150 pilgrims, has been built out of local funds by the British Government.\n\nOn the south bank of the Dadhimati stream, every year in Shr\u00e1van vad \u00c1'tham (August-September), a fair is held. It lasts from sunrise to sunset, and is generally attended by about 7000 persons. Except toys and sweetmeats, little is bought or sold. Besides being the seat of the chief revenue and police officers of the sub-division, Dohad is the head-quarter station of the Bhil corps and of the assistant superintendent of police, and is provided with a sub-judge's court, a civil hospital, a district jail, a post office, and a vernacular school.\n\nGodhra, a town in 1872 of 10,635 souls and 3259 houses, the head-quarter station of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls district and of the Godhra sub-division, lies in north latitude 22\u00b0 46' and east longitude 73\u00b0 40', fifty-two miles north-east of Baroda and seventeen miles east of the P\u00e1li railway station. Except for a stretch of rice land to the west\n\n---\n\n1 Of the fort said to have been built in 1419 by Sult\u00e1n Ahmad I. (1411-1443) and about 1515 repaired by Sult\u00e1n Muzaffar (1513-1526), no trace seems to remain. The caravanserai is also called gh\u00e1di or fortress; but this apparently because Sindi\u00e1's governor lived in it.\n\n2 Elliot's History, VII. 213. Elphinstone 591, note 1, gives October 1618.\n\n3 The rooms vary in size from $39^{\\circ}7'' \\times 32^{\\circ}8'' \\times 10^{\\circ}6''$ to $22^{\\circ}7'' \\times 10^{\\circ}6'' \\times 10^{\\circ}5''$.\nGodhra is almost entirely surrounded by brushwood and forest. On a plot of ground slightly raised above the general level of the plain, with no walls or large buildings and much hid by trees, the town attracts little notice. About half a mile to the south is a group of four lately-built district officers' houses. Not more than 900 feet above the sea and surrounded by rice and forest land, the climate of Godhra is especially towards the close of the rainy season feverish and relaxing.\n\nGodhra, or Godrahaka, that is the cow's lake, is a town of considerable antiquity, supposed to be mentioned as 'the camp of victory' in a brass plate grant of the fifth century. Probably because Champa\u0144er was their chief settlement in this part of Gujar\u00e1t, Godhra would seem to have been of little consequence under the Rajput dynasties of Anhilv\u00e1da (746-1298). In the thirteenth century (1225) it is mentioned as subject to the chief of Dholka. To the Musalm\u00e1n kings of Ahmedabad, before Champa\u0144er was conquered, Godhra was one of the centres of government in eastern Gujar\u00e1t. Mahmud Begada, when in 1480 he divided his dominions, chose Godhra as the head-quarters of one of five provinces. Even after (1484) Champa\u0144er became his capital, Godhra continued the head of a considerable district. At the time of its transfer to the Emperor Akbar (1573) it contained ten sub-divisions with 501 villages, yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a3350,000 (7,200,000 changizis).\n\nUnder the Moghals the lands were surveyed and the number of dependent sub-divisions raised to twelve. In 1724 it was taken by Kant\u00e1ji Kadam B\u00e1nde and probably kept by him till about 1760. Since then Godhra has continued the headquarters of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, first under Sindia (1770-1853), and then under the British.\n\nSince its transfer (1853) the two chief events in the history of the town are a Musalm\u00e1n riot in 1855 and a fire in 1857. The riot was among Musalm\u00e1ns, Sunnis against Shi\u00e1s. The Shi\u00e1s of the D\u00e1udi Bohora community went on the 26th August to hold a feast at an idga or place of prayer outside of the town. The man in charge, a Sunni beggar, objected to their coming and a scuffle took place. Going into the town he complained to the police and an inquiry was made. As the examination was not finished\n\n---\n\n1 The name Godraha occurs in Someshvar's Kirti Kaumudi, IV. 57, where it is stated that the lords of Godraha and L\u00e1ta, the country between the Narbada and T\u00e1pti, betrayed their master the chief of Dholka. Godraha can only refer to the present Godhra. The other reference in a grant of Shik\u00e1ditya V. of Valabhi about 404 is not so certain. Dr. B\u00fchler in Ind. Ant. LXIII. 16, 17.\n\n2 Ind. Ant. LXIII. 16. During this period no other reference to Godhra has been traced either in the R\u00e1s M\u00e1l\u00e1 or in Tod's Annals of Rajasth\u00e1n.\n\n3 Briggs' Ferishta, IV. 62. The five divisions were Ahmedabad, Jagat, Godhra, Songad, and Th\u00e1na.\n\n4 Bird's Gujar\u00e1t, 124. The ten sub-divisions were at the close of the 16th century Godhra, Sehra, Miral, Samd\u00e1h or Nasirabad, Dod\u00e1h, Amb\u00e1had, Jh\u00e1lod, Morv\u00e1h, Kaddk\u00e1h\u00e1 and D\u00e1hmood. Two other Godhra sub-divisions were at that time (1573) in the hands of the Sunth chief and of Chatr\u00e1l Kuli. According to the Ain-i-Akbar\u00ed (Gladwin, II. 242) the area was 535,255 bigh\u00e1s and the yearly revenue Rs. 85,458 (34,18,324 d\u00e1m\u00e9s). The names of the sub-divisions differ considerably from those given in the Mirat-i-Ahmadi; they are Audha, Atladera, Bera, Jednagar, Jh\u00e1lod, Dharmad, Sehra, Godhra, Kohaneh, Miral, Mehdv\u00e1da.\n\n5 Malcolm's Central India, I. 78; the date of Sindi\u00e1's conquest has not been ascertained.\nbefore nightfall, some Sunni Musalm\u00e1ns meeting at the K\u00e1zi's house determined to take the punishment of the Bohor\u00e1s into their own hands. Next morning (27th August) gathering in a large crowd they surrounded the entrance to the Bohora quarter, seized two Bohor\u00e1s, and setting them on asses dragged them through the town. When the police came the Bohora quarter was already broken into and plundered. The rioters were driven back and a guard set over the Bohora quarter. No further acts of violence were committed. But for three days (29th-31st) the houses and shops remained shut, the mob continuing to hold the market place. They then dispersed without doing further mischief. About sixty of the rioters were convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying from six months to three years and to from \u00a35 to \u00a310 fines.\n\nThe fire of 1857 broke out on the 2nd April. A strong wind was blowing from the north and a hut in the north outskirts of the town catching fire, the flames spread rapidly. Except the Government offices and some small outlying parts to the east and west, nearly the whole of Godhra, its well built Bohora, S\u00e1buk\u00e1r, and Gh\u00e1nchi quarters with many handsome three-storied houses, was completely burnt down. Very little property was saved and two persons and many cattle were killed. On the 5th March 1873 a serious fire broke out in the densely populated Gh\u00e1nchi quarter: 188 houses were burnt and property worth \u00a34400 (Rs. 44,000) destroyed.\n\nOf 10,635, the total 1872 population, 4775 or 44\u00b789 per cent were Hindus; 5854 or 55\u00b704 per cent Muhammadans, and six Others. The two classes of chief local importance are both Musalm\u00e1ns. The Shia Bohor\u00e1s are traders and hardware dealers and the Gh\u00e1nchis are carriers, traders, and husbandmen. The Shia Bohor\u00e1s are a prosperous well-to-do community. But the Gh\u00e1nchis though frugal and hard-working have of late years suffered from the break-up of their monopoly of the carrying trade and have some of them fallen into poverty.\n\nOil-making is carried on to some extent in Godhra. In 1867 a steam mill was started by a company known as the Godhra oil company. It worked for about five months and then closed for want of funds. In 1870 the mill was sold to a P\u00e1rsi merchant of Bombay, who worked it, with occasional stoppages, till July 1877. Two kinds of seed, tal, Sesamum indicum, and dolia, Bassia latifolia, were pressed in the mill.\n\nThere are also several families of weavers, some of them Dheds who weave coarse sacking, gani, cloth; the rest, Khatris and Musalm\u00e1ns of the Momma class make the finer sorts of different coloured robes. There is also some pottery, brasswork, and wooden bracelet-making, the Godhra market supplying those articles to a considerable area of country. As a place of trade Godhra has of late years risen in importance. The opening of the railway to P\u00e1li\n\n---\n\n1 Twenty years before (1837) Godhra was almost entirely destroyed by fire. Sindi\u00e1s Government gave \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000) for the sufferers' relief.\nChapter XIV.\n\nPlaces of Interest.\n\nGodhra.\n\nhas increased the local exports, and the trade tends more than formerly to centre in Godhra. If, as has been proposed, the railway line is brought on seventeen miles from P\u00e1li, Godhra will become a place of consequence, the trade centre for Jh\u00e1lod and Dohad in the east, B\u00e1riya in the south, and Lun\u00e1v\u00e1da and Sunth in the north. Its chief exports are timber, mah\u00fada flower, maize, gram, and oil seeds; its chief imports tobacco, molasses, and hardware. As the headquarters of the district, and the chief town of the sub-division, Godhra has, besides the offices of the Agent to the Governor, his assistant, the district superintendent of police, the forest officer, the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r and the civil judge or munsif, a dispensary, a post office, and three vernacular schools.\n\nThe only objects of interest in the town of Godhra are the lake and the fort to the north-east of the town. The lake about seventy acres in extent is embanked, faced with stone, and on the west and south provided with flights of stone steps. The name of the town the \u2018cow\u2019s lake\u2019 would seem to show that this reservoir is of great age. The fort is of mud, of little size or strength. At present it contains the offices of the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r and of the local judge or munsif. Every year on Gokal Atham (August-September) a fair is held attended by about 1000 Bhils and Kol\u00eds. The gathering lasts only a few hours and is of no trade importance.\n\nH\u00e1'lol.\n\nH\u00e1'lol, in 1872 a town of 3147 inhabitants, the head-quarters of the petty division of the same name, lies on the high road to J\u00e1mbughoda, about seven miles south of K\u00e1lol and four north-west of P\u00e1v\u00e1gad hill. Besides well-to-do Kanbi cultivators, the largest class in the town, there are V\u00e1nia traders carrying on business in grain and forest produce with J\u00e1mbughoda, and in hardware, tobacco, and cloth with Godhra and Baroda. At H\u00e1'lol is said to have been (1484) the most beautiful of all the gardens for which Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner and its suburbs were famous.\u00b9 The chief remains of its former prosperity as a suburb of Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner, are to the north-east of the town, a reservoir of considerable size but without stone steps or other masonry. Within the limits of the present town is a mausoleum described in 1785 as two large and five small domed structures, all of admirable workmanship, the two larger containing marble tombs adorned with excellent skill.\u00b2 Since then some of the domes have fallen, but in other respects the buildings are in good repair. They were raised by Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h (1526-1536) in honour of his brother Sikandar Sh\u00e1h murdered by Im\u00e1d-ul-mulk in 1526 (May 30th) after a reign of three months and seventeen days. The mausoleum contains two more tombs, one to N\u00e1sir Kh\u00e1n, the other to Latif Kh\u00e1n, both of them brothers of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h who died in the same year (1526). At the time of building the tombs a suitable establishment was endowed to say daily prayers for the princes\u2019 souls.\u00b3\n\nJha'lod is the chief town of the petty division of the same name, the northern half of the Dohad sub-division. Lying in north\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Mirat-i-Sikandari (1611) quoted in Ind. Ant. LXIII. 5.\n\u00b2 Forbes\u2019 Or. Mem.

In 1825 Jh\u00e1lod is described\\(^1\\) as but little deserving the name of a city; still it had a market, a mosque, a small temple, and some good solidly built two-story high brick houses. There is a large and handsome pond. The people are chiefly husbandmen, most of them Bhils and Kolis. Except a little pottery and handloom weaving there are almost no manufactures. But there are several families of V\u00e1nia traders, and there is a considerable export of wheat and gram, chiefly south to Dohad and south-west to Godhra.\n\nKa'lol is the head-quarter town of the sub-division of the same name. It lies in north latitude 22\u00b0 37' and east longitude 73\u00b0 31', and contains a population of 3993 souls. The centre of the richest cultivation in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls, and with a large proportion of well-to-do Kanbi inhabitants, K\u00e1lol is a prosperous town, though its importance has to some extent been affected by the recent change in the course of trade to P\u00e1li instead of to Baroda.\n\nLila'vati. The three villages, Lilva Pokar, Lilva Deva, and Lilva Th\u00e1kor in the Jh\u00e1lod sub-division, are said to stand on the site of an old town, Lila'vati by name, where according to the local story, the P\u00e1ndavs in their wanderings stayed. The place is still marked by several Mah\u00e1dev temples with spirited and clear out sculptures.\n\nPa'va'gad. See pages 185-190.\n\nShera, about twelve miles north of Godhra, is on Gokal A'tham (August-September) the scene of a fair in honour of Mah\u00e1dev. The gathering seldom numbers more than two or three hundred Bhils and Kolis and is of no trade importance.\n\nTuva, about ten miles west of Godhra, is remarkable for its hot springs of which some account has been given in Chapter I. Here on the 11th of Ph\u00e1gan (February-March) a few hundred Bhils and Kolis assemble to worship Mah\u00e1dev. Since the opening of the P\u00e1li railway, the number of visitors has much increased.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Heb. Nar.
